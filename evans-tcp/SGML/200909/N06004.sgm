<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief occa&s;ion of publi&s;hing the following di&s;cour&s;e, is becau&s;e of what is &s;aid therein about the &s;ubjects of <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> which is a point that has been long controverted among the greate&s;t and be&s;t of men. But &s;ince there has been &s;o many volumes written upon it, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> many will be ready to object again&s;t any more's being added now, e&s;pecially from one that &s;ome are pleas'd to call <HI>a young up&s;tart,</HI> and di&s;dain to be taught by him. But without regard to &s;uch flings, I &s;hall beg leave in an&s;wer to this objection to tell the reader a little of my own experience.&mdash;I was educated from a child in the contrary principles to what I now imbrace concerning bapti&s;m; and my education had this to inforce it, that it came from progenitors who were &s;undry of them eminently godly, who&s;e in&s;truc|tions godly examples and prayers, I tru&s;t I &s;hall ble&s;s God for to eternity. And after I tru&s;t my &s;oul was brought to the &s;aving knowledge of Chri&s;t, I made a publick profe&s;&s;ion in that way: to which may be added that I have &s;ince been called (though mo&s;t unworthy) to preach the go&s;pel, and to take the charge of a flock, in which I practi&s;ed <HI>Infant-bap|ti&s;m</HI> my &s;elf: all the&s;e, and &s;ome other things con|curred to bind me in that way; but the irre&s;i&s;table evidence of divine truth broke through them all. Though when this point was fir&s;t brought in di&s;|pute among us, I labour'd under &s;ome peculiar di&s;|advantages, having my mind heavily burdened with a &s;en&s;e of pa&s;t neglect of duty in things of another nature, which at times made me afraid of looking
<PB REF="007613_0004_102BA93E9BBE62F0">
into the&s;e matters, lea&s;t I &s;hould be left of God to imbrace an error; and this, together with the hot di&s;putes, and vehement urgings that we then had among us on both &s;ides, occa&s;ion'd &s;uch to&s;&s;ings in my mind as &s;eemed, as if they would have <HI>&s;ifted</HI> and &s;haken me (as it were) to pieces; after which I was much overwhelmed with melancholy, and di&s;|couragements for a great while. Yet having &s;ince obtain'd through divine mercy &s;weet deliverance and e&s;tabli&s;hment, them words have often born with weight upon my mind, <HI>When thou art converted, &s;trengthen thy brethren:</HI> And being &s;en&s;ible that many of my brethren are labouring under &s;ome of the &s;ame difficulties that I did, and having &s;ome clear view of &s;everal things in this affair, that I have not lit of in any human writings, the&s;e and &s;ome other con&s;iderations have inclined me to yield to the reque&s;t of tho&s;e who have de&s;ired that this &s;ermon might be publi&s;hed. I don't expect in this little piece to plea&s;e the <HI>Curious;</HI> much le&s;s a <HI>vain</HI> carping world: but if it may benefit, or be any help to &s;erious inquiring minds, I have my end.&mdash;Of &s;uch I a&s;k this one reque&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> that when you get near to God, you would remember your unworthy brother and Servant in the go&s;pel.</P>

<P>N. B. <HI>The rea&s;on why I have &s;aid nothing in this tract upon the</HI> mode <HI>of bapti&s;m, is not for want of clearne&s;s therein in my own mind; but becau&s;e this &s;ubject more naturally led to &s;hew who might partake of this ordinance, than how it &s;hould be admini&s;tred. And al&s;o, I &s;carce ever meet with any that deny immer&s;ion's being a go&s;pel mode: and I believe that when men &s;hall have done bringing</HI> infants <HI>to bapti&s;m, they'll generally have done with</HI> &s;prinkling <HI>therein likewi&s;e.</HI></P>

<P>So then, Brethren we are not the chil|dren of the Bond-woman, but of the Free.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_ALTHOUGH mankind are aw|fully inclined to di&s;regard God's law when in a carele&s;s &s;tate, yet when they are wounded by con|viction, in&s;tead of coming to Chri&s;t, they fly to the law and their own works for relief. And though (as one ob&s;erves) man's legal di&s;po&s;ition has little need of being en|couraged by legal preaching; yet &s;ome will teach people in this way: which it &s;eems was the ca&s;e among the <HI>Galatians,</HI> that occa&s;ion'd the writing of this epi&s;tle. Some teachers (it appears) had zea|lou&s;ly brought in the &s;ame doctrine among them, which before was preached to the di&s;ciples at <HI>An|tioch,</HI> viz. That <HI>except they were circumci&s;ed and kept the law of</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>they could not be &s;aved.</HI> Which then was called a <HI>&s;ubverting their &s;ouls.</HI> (Act. xv. 24.) And now 'tis called a <HI>perverting the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> (chap. i. 7.). Therefore the apo&s;tle warns them &s;harply again&s;t &s;uch &s;nares: and he intimates that the rea&s;on why men cleave &s;o clo&s;e to the law, is becau&s;e they don't hear the law, nor under&s;tand its true nature and &s;trictne&s;s,
<PB N="2" REF="007613_0006_102BA94099707F38">
(context ver. 21.) And in order to make this matter more plain, he &s;ets before them the in&s;tance of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s two &s;ons that he had, one by a <HI>Bond-maid,</HI> the other by a <HI>Free-woman,</HI> which things he &s;hews to be an allegorical repre&s;entation of the two covenants:&mdash;and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e upon each, he concludes with the&s;e words;&mdash;<HI>So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</HI></P>
<P>Which expre&s;&s;ions naturally lead us to enquire who each of the&s;e women are; and al&s;o to look into the characters, and conditions of their children.</P>
<P N="1">I. Who is this Bond-woman? <HI>An&s;wer</HI> 1. The moral law, as it was fir&s;t given to men, commonly called the covenant of works; the tenor of which is, <HI>Do this and thou &s;halt live,</HI> but <HI>in the day that thou &s;inne&s;t thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> Gen. ii. 17. <HI>Lev.</HI> xviii. 5. <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 12. which &s;hews that in order to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing promis'd, we mu&s;t perfectly, and con&s;tantly live in a conformity to this law without the lea&s;t failure; for if we don't <HI>continue to do all things that are written in the law,</HI> we are immediately bound under the cur&s;e, (<HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 10.) and &s;o &s;tand expo&s;ed to eternal damnation; from which nothing can deliver but a complete &s;atis|faction to divine ju&s;tice for the offences committed, (<HI>and without &s;hedding of blood there is no remi&s;&s;ion.</HI> Heb. ix. 22.)&mdash;This law, and covenant of works was evidently given to, and made with our Father <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradi&s;e, though we have it not &s;o fully expre&s;t, and recorded till <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s time. Then as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, <HI>The law entered,</HI> (Rom. v. 20) or was publi&s;hed and proclaimed to the congregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> from mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> out of the mid&s;t of the fire and &s;moke, even the ten commandments.
<PB N="3" REF="007613_0007_102BA90F0504CA40">
Hence the apo&s;tle &s;ays here (ver. 25.) that this <HI>Agor</HI> is mount <HI>Sinai</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> i. e. 'tis the law that was deliver'd from thence, which gendereth to bondage.</P>
<P N="2">2. This bond-woman includes al&s;o the ceremo|nial law, which likewi&s;e was given to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and from him to the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> at <HI>Sinai,</HI> Exod. xxv. &amp;c. I know indeed that the ceremonial law, as it was a <HI>&s;hadow of good things to come,</HI> and ty|pified Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the ble&s;&s;ings of his grace, brought very joyful news to peri&s;hing Souls; and tho&s;e who were enabled by faith to look through them &s;igns to the things &s;ignified, enjoy'd great ble&s;&s;ings therein. But then tho&s;e rites and cere|monies in them&s;elves could never take away &s;in: and they &s;eem to be given much after the tenor of the old covenant. If any man had &s;inned, then he mu&s;t provide his own offering, and bring it for his &s;in that he had &s;inned: <HI>Lev.</HI> iv.&mdash;And &s;o for any uncleanne&s;s&mdash;what a long train of ceremonial labours mu&s;t they do in order for clean&s;ing? <HI>Lev.</HI> xivth and xvth chapters. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> &s;peaking of the <HI>Sinai</HI> covenant &s;ays,
<Q>Some per&s;ons indeed, call it a legal di&s;pen&s;ation of the cove|nant of grace, (with whom I will not contend) but it is more agreable to the language of Scripture, to call it a di&s;tinct covenant, or, a covenant and law of works, as a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Appendix to the go&s;pel.</Q>
<BIBL>&mdash;Orthodoxy and Charity united, P. 36.</BIBL></NOTE> And from what the apo|&s;tle &s;ays concerning the end of the law's being given, <HI>viz. That the offence might abound;</HI> and that it was <HI>added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> (Rom. v. 20. Gal. iii. 19.) I humbly conceive that we may learn, that one great thing de&s;igned in tho&s;e ceremonies, was to &s;hew the heinous nature, and great evil of &s;in, and thereby to di&s;cover more clearly man's awful, and helple&s;s Condition, and his nece&s;&s;ity of a Chri&s;t.&mdash;
<PB N="4" REF="007613_0008_102BA9426E63AFC8">
That when he had brought the greate&s;t, and mo&s;t co&s;tly &s;acrifices, even thou&s;ands of rams, or ten thou&s;ands of rivers of oil, (<HI>Mic.</HI> vi. 7, 8.) all would avail nothing for the taking away &s;in and guilt: As &s;ays our glorious mediator, &s;acrifice and offering, and burnt-offerings for &s;in, thou woulde&s;t not (which are offered by the law;) then &s;aid he, <HI>Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God. He taketh away the fir&s;t, that he may e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;econd.</HI> Heb. x. 8, 9.&mdash;Indeed it is plain that the body of the forms and ordinances of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church are often re|pre&s;ented as a yoke of bondage. In the council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Peter</HI> calls them, <HI>A yoke which neither they, nor their fathers were able to bear.</HI> Acts xv. 10. And in our context, <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hews that one part of the bondage which he warned them people again&s;t, con&s;i&s;ted in being held under tho&s;e <HI>beggarly elements;</HI> and in ob&s;erving ceremonial <HI>days, months</HI> and <HI>years.</HI> ver. 9, 10.</P>
<P>And further, by the bond-woman, &s;eems to be intended the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church, in her legal &s;tanding: hence the apo&s;tle adds; <HI>And an&s;wereth to Jeru&s;a|lem that now is, and is in bondage with her chil|dren,</HI> ver. 25. and in the beginning of the next chapter, he warns them as they would keep clear of this bondage, to beware of <HI>circumci&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;Should it be &s;aid that what is here de&s;igned, is not, that them ordinances were &s;uch a yoke in them&s;elves; but only that the <HI>Jews</HI> had perverted them from their proper u&s;e. I reply, that 'tis in a mea&s;ure &s;o; though in them&s;elves they were an in&s;upportable ta&s;k. In &s;hort by the bond-woman I under&s;tand the covenant of works in general, and all the ways in particular, wherein men &s;eek for life, by what they can do; and think either in whole, or in part to &s;atisfy for their &s;ins, and purcha&s;e divine favours,
<PB N="5" REF="007613_0009_102BA9117A541548">
either by duties of morality, or by ob&s;erving any ordinances and forms of wor&s;hip what&s;oever.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us con&s;ider who her children are, and what a condition they are in.</P>
<P>And here the ca&s;e is very plain that the children of the bond-woman, are all that are <HI>born after the fle&s;h</HI> (ver. 23.) that is, all mankind in their natural condition. But &s;hould any &s;ay that <HI>I&s;hmael</HI>'s being born after the fle&s;h, intends an unlawful birth, his mother not being <HI>Abraham</HI>'s lawful wife. I an|&s;wer no, by no means for then he would have been a ba&s;tard, and &s;uch an one mu&s;t not come into the congregation of the Lord. <HI>Deut.</HI> 23.&mdash;but he was circumci&s;ed and admitted to outward privileges as well as <HI>I&s;aac.</HI> This objection might as well be laid again&s;t four of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s &s;ons, as again&s;t this, their mothers being maids or handmaids before; yet they are ever reckned to make up the 12 tribes of God's <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> But it is evident beyond di&s;pute, that his being born after the fle&s;h, does not intend a being <HI>illegitimate,</HI> but only that he had no other than a natural birth: he was never <HI>born again,</HI> without which none can enter into the kingdom of God. And &s;o now all who have only a natural birth are children of the bond-woman. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays of him&s;elf, and other Saints,&mdash;<HI>We are by nature, children of wrath, even as others.</HI> Eph. ii. 3. and he tells the <HI>Romans,</HI> that he had proved both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that they are all under &s;in, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 9&mdash;<HI>Jews, Phari&s;ees,</HI> and all the world are guilty before God ver. 19.</P>
<P>And never did a child more naturally run to its mother for help, than man when wounded with a &s;en&s;e of guilt flies to his own works for relief: his cry is, <HI>Have patience with me, and I'll pay thee
<PB N="6" REF="007613_0010_102BA944F25550A0">
all:</HI> but very &s;ad is the condition of &s;uch &s;ouls. They may ju&s;tly be called children of the bond-woman for the&s;e rea&s;ons. 1. Becau&s;e their work is hard. Slaves have often both hard work to do, and are drove hard in it to do a great deal: So is the ca&s;e here; the law requires not only that which is hard, but that which is impo&s;&s;ible, for us to do. It requires us to make us a new heart, and a new &s;pirit, as we would e&s;cape death. <HI>Ezek.</HI> xviii. 31. And it demands that we make recompence for all pa&s;t faults, and walk in the &s;tatutes of life, without committing iniquity, as we would hope to live. <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxiii. 15. Yea, it follows the &s;oul up &s;o, that it &s;ays, <HI>If thou keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, thou art guilty of all.</HI> Jam. ii. 10. I know &s;ome &s;ay that God cannot ju&s;tly re|quire of us more than we can do. But this di&s;|covers men's awful blindne&s;s, What! is it become an unju&s;t thing for this glorious Creditor to demand his full due, becau&s;e man is turned bankrupt, and is no way able to pay it! (<HI>Luk.</HI> vii. 42.) O hea|ven-daring madne&s;s! Nay this &s;ets a&s;ide all that Chri&s;t has done as vain, for he came upon this very footing; namely becau&s;e we were <HI>without &s;trength, therefore in due time he died for the ungodly,</HI> Rom. v. 6. <HI>And what the law could not do,</HI> (i. e. ju&s;tify a &s;inner) <HI>God &s;ent his &s;on</HI> to do. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 3.&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. Souls under the old covenant are like bond-&s;ervants in this, that they can claim no right to the inheritance, or even to a continuance in the fa|mily, but may be &s;old away, or &s;hut up in pri&s;on, notwith&s;tanding all that they have done when the ma&s;ter thinks proper.&mdash;<HI>The &s;ervant abideth not in the hou&s;e for ever; but the &s;on abideth ever.</HI> Joh. viii. 35. Since the law is broken, man can claim nothing by it, but wrath and damnation.
<PB N="7" REF="007613_0011_102BA913026E5468">
<HI>The law worketh wrath.</HI> (Rom. iv. 15.) <HI>and as many as are of the works of the law, are under the cur&s;e.</HI> Gal. iii. 10. So that after all their per|formances which they boa&s;t them&s;elves in, the &s;en|tence will ju&s;tly be given out, and executed upon them.&mdash;<HI>Ca&s;t out the bond-woman and her &s;on; for the &s;on of the bond-woman, &s;hall not be heir with the &s;on of the free-woman.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Bond-&s;ervants, when they have toiled and la|boured many years, are no more relea&s;t from their bondage, than when they began: &s;o all that are under the law, let them fa&s;t twice in the week, and make many and long prayers, and be as exact as ever the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> were, in all their walk; yet our Lord a&s;&s;ures us, that they mu&s;t have a righteou&s;|ne&s;s beyond all this, or they can in no ca&s;e enter into the kingdom of heaven. <HI>Matt.</HI> v. 20.&mdash;By the deeds of the law, no fle&s;h living can be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God. So that every unbeliever, will eternally remain under condemnation after all their doing. Ah! deplorable ca&s;e indeed! well might the apo&s;tle think that tho&s;e who de&s;ired to be under the law, did not hear it, nor know its true nature and &s;trictne&s;s. Surely if they did, they would &s;oon cry (as <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did at <HI>Sinai</HI>) for a me|diator to &s;tand between God and them.&mdash;Hence I proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. To &s;hew who the free-woman is, here &s;po|ken of. And by this I under&s;tand, fir&s;t the glo|rious covenant of grace, made between the Father, and the Son, before the world began. Therefore God &s;ays, <HI>I have made a covenant with my cho&s;en, &mdash;I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one cho&s;en out of the people.</HI> P&s;al. lxxxix. 3, 19. The &s;um of which covenant (for I cannot
<PB N="8" REF="007613_0012_102BA947463708B0">
be large in de&s;cribing of it) is, That the Son of God &s;hould a&s;&s;ume our nature, and in that nature perfectly obey the law which we have broken, and bear the puni&s;hment due unto us for &s;in, and &s;o make reconcilation for iniquity, and bring in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, thro' which God could be ju&s;t, and yet the ju&s;tifier of the ungodly: &mdash;As the fruit of which, the Father engaged by the in|fluences of the holy Spirit, effectually to draw many of the &s;ons of men to Chri&s;t; work faith in their hearts, ju&s;tify and &s;anctify their &s;ouls, and keep them by his power, thro' faith unto eternal &s;alva|tion: <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.9&mdash;17. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 40.6&mdash;8. <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.24. <HI>John</HI> 16.7&mdash;13. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.29, 30. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2&mdash;5.</P>
<P>Which glorious plan, is &s;o far from de&s;troying, or &s;etting a&s;ide the law, that it e&s;tabli&s;hes, yea magnifies, and makes it honourable (<HI>Rom.</HI> 3.31. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 42.21.) and &s;hews how heinous every breach of it is, even &s;o great that no tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of that law could e&s;cape eternal puni&s;hment without a perfect &s;atisfaction for every offence again&s;t it. But by Chri&s;t's obedience and &s;ufferings there is a way opened wherein the greate&s;t &s;inner may be pardon|ed, and God's image be re-in&s;tamped on his heart, and that he may come to enjoy all divine ble&s;&s;ings here, and for ever more. Hence the Lord &s;ays, <HI>This is the covenant that I will make with the hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>after tho&s;e days;&mdash;I will put my laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they &s;hall be to me a people.</HI> Heb. viii. 10.</P>
<P>Further, by the free-woman is intended the go&s;|pel-church in her pure &s;tanding&mdash;Hence in our context &s;he is called <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> which is above&mdash; which is the mother of us all (<HI>ver.</HI> 26.) So in <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 18&mdash;24. it is &s;aid that we <HI>are not come to the

<P N="4">IV. To de&s;cribe the character and State of her children.

And 'twas thro' faith that <HI>Sa|rah</HI> al&s;o received &s;trength to conceive this &s;eed. <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 11.&mdash;There appear'd nothing more than the actings of nature in <HI>I&s;hmael</HI>'s birth: but in <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s there was faith on both &s;ides; which made him a wonderful type of the &s;eed here pointed at. He was promi&s;ed before he had a being; and &s;o was every child of the free-woman here &s;poken of: They were <HI>cho&s;en in Chri&s;t, before the world began.</HI> Eph. i. 4. And <HI>God that cannot lie, promi&s;ed eter|nal life,</HI> &s;o early. Tit. i. 2.

As thou ha&s;t given him power over all fle&s;h, that he &s;hould give eternal life, to as many as thou ha&s;t given him.</HI> But this election of grace is not known to us, 'till we are born again: therefore, as <HI>I&s;aac</HI> was born according to promi&s;e; &s;o every one of the&s;e who are promi&s;ed to Chri&s;t &s;hall be converted in due time: hence he &s;ays, <HI>All that the Father giveth me, &s;hall come to me: and

And as on the other &s;ide, the children of the bond-woman drag on like &s;laves, and they &s;ay of Gods &s;ervice, <HI>what a wearine&s;s is it:</HI> &s;o the chil|dren of the free-woman obey him, not out of &s;lavi&s;h dread; (but like free born &s;ouls) they &s;erve him WITHOUT FEAR, in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s be|fore him all the days of their lives. <HI>Luke</HI> 1.74.75.

<P>In &s;hort, the children of the free-woman are freed from the condemnation of the law, from the power of &s;in and &s;atan, and have freedom of approach to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and it is made their free|dom and liberty to walk in holine&s;s all their days, and they have the liberty of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e, and have a right to all the priviledges of the &s;ons of God here, and are heirs of an incorruptible inheri|tance above; and by and by they &s;hall be received to that glory: and in the great day, their bodies &s;hall be rai&s;ed from the du&s;t, and &s;hall be delivered from the <HI>bondage of corruption into the glorious liber|ty of the &s;ons of God.</HI> Rom. 8.21, 23.&mdash;And when the bond-woman, and all her children &s;hall be ca&s;t out into outer-darkne&s;s: then &s;hall the&s;e children of the free-woman be openly received to enjoy the kingdom, prepared for them before the foundation of the world.&mdash;<HI>Mat.</HI> 25.&mdash;</P>

This mount <HI>Sinai</HI> gendreth to bondage, and tho&s;e who would get life by the law, let 'em come before it and &s;ee the darkne&s;s, fire and &s;moke, and hear the thundrings and the fiery law, that comes from thence. Surely if &s;ouls come here, they will &s;oon &s;ee the need of a Mediator to &s;tand between them and this God, who is a con|&s;uming fire.

You mu&s;t fully pay that dreadful debt, and walk in the &s;tatutes of life for the future, without ever committing another &s;in, el&s;e there's no life by that law.&mdash;If you &s;ay, that this is too &s;trait; be intreated to look a little farther into the nature of the law, and you will find it is &s;o &s;trait, that Heaven and Earth will pa&s;s away, before one tittle of the law can pa&s;s away, 'till all be fulfilled. <HI>Matt.</HI> 5.18. When God treats with men in the old covenant, he deals with them ac|cording to the &s;trict tenor of it: and when he treats with them in the covenant of grace, then tho' their debts are very great, yet, <HI>when they have nothing to pay he frankly forgives them</HI> all. <HI>Luk</HI> 7.42.

&s;inners vainly expect &s;ome of the ble&s;&s;ings of grace, while they yet cleave to the law.</P>
<P><HI>USE</HI> II. Hence we may learn who have a right to the privileges of the new covenant: <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e (and tho&s;e only) who are born again. The children of the free-woman partake of her ble&s;&s;ings; but the children of the bond-woman, &s;hall not be heirs with the children of the free-woman.&mdash;I am &s;en&s;i|ble that there are many contentions among pro|fe&s;&s;ors of religion about the&s;e things. Many think that &s;inners may claim a right to &s;ome of the <HI>pomi&s;es</HI> of grace: particularly &s;uch as the&s;e,&mdash;<HI>A&s;k and ye &s;hall receive, &s;eek and ye &s;hall find.</HI> And <HI>if any man lack Wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it &s;hall be given him.</HI>&mdash;But if they look a little further, they are told that they mu&s;t <HI>a&s;k in faith,</HI> if they would think to receive any thing from the Lord. <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.5, 6, 7. Indeed here God appeals to their con&s;ciences, and &s;ays, <HI>are not my ways equal?</HI> (Ezek. 18.) <HI>are not your ways unequal?</HI> If you keep un|der the old covenant, I deal with you according to the tenor of it: if you perfectly obey it's precepts, you &s;hall have the ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed: but he that offends in one point is guilty of all; and then there is <HI>tribulation and wrath, upon every &s;oul of man that doeth evil.</HI> Rom. 2.9. The promi&s;es and threat|nings of the old covenant belong to the children of the old covenant: and the promi&s;es of the new co|venant belong only to her children. Hence &s;uch alone are &s;til'd <HI>heirs of promi&s;e,</HI> who have <HI>fled for refuge, to lay hold on the hope &s;et before us:</HI> Heb. 6.17, 18. None others can claim the promi&s;es of grace, for, <HI>All the promi&s;es of God</HI> IN <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us, are yea, and</HI> IN <HI>him amen:</HI> 2 Cor. 1.20. There|fore

<P>As for preaching, exhortation, &amp;c. God has giv|en them forth in general to the world, and calls all men every where to repent: But &s;ome imagine that the Lord's &s;upper was appointed for a convert|ing ordinance; and &s;o that unconverted per&s;ons, if moral, ought to come to it. But if it was appoint- for conver&s;ion, &s;urely the profane have as much need of that as any; though 'tis evident that this is children's bread, and therefore by no means to be given to dogs. <HI>Matt.</HI> vii. 6. Many others think that Bapti&s;m is not confined only to &s;aints, but that their natural off-&s;pring are al&s;o to partake of it. And I find that the main arguments for both, are fetcht from the con&s;titution of the old-te&s;tament-church, holding that to be modled according to the new covenant:&mdash;though here in our text we are told that, <HI>This Agar is mount Sinai,&mdash;and an&s;wereth to Jeru&s;alem that now is, and is in bondage with her children:</HI> i. e. the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church in her legal &s;tand|ing: that church and the go&s;pel-church are &s;et as wide apart as the old covenant and the new. In <HI>Heb.</HI> viii. the covenant at <HI>Sinai,</HI> is called <HI>Old;</HI> and God &s;ays expre&s;ly that the new-covenant is <HI>not ac|cording to</HI> that: and that old con&s;titution we are told, was then <HI>ready to vani&s;h away,</HI> ver. 9, 13. The original con&s;titution of that church was &s;uch, that it took in whole hou&s;holds, and &s;o a whole na|tion.&mdash;Natural generation (being born of profe&s;&s;ors of that religion) gave a right to circumci&s;ion, and
<PB N="18" REF="007613_0022_102BA95285402590">
&s;o to all the privileges of that church: and a being bought with an <HI>Hebrews</HI> money, gave the &s;ervant a right both to circumci&s;ion and the pa&s;&s;over. <HI>Exod.</HI> xii. 44. And the covenant that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> mentions in <HI>Deut.</HI> xxix. took in &s;uch as had not an <HI>heart to per|ceive, eyes to &s;ee,</HI> nor <HI>ears to hear.</HI> But <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hews clearly that in the new-te&s;tament, <HI>The children of the fle&s;h are not the children of God: but the chil|dren of the promi&s;e are counted for the &s;eed.</HI> Rom. ix. 8. And lea&s;t any &s;hould &s;ay that a being born after the fle&s;h, meant an unlawful birth, he imme|diately adds the in&s;tance of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>E&s;au,</HI> as ex|actly parallel, who were not only both born of one mother, but al&s;o at one time; and yet <HI>E&s;au</HI> was in as bad a ca&s;e as <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> ver. 10,&mdash;13.</P>
<P>But what will, I apprehend, &s;et this matter in the cleare&s;t light, is, to con&s;ider it in the line of <HI>type</HI> and <HI>antitype.</HI>&mdash;It is abundantly &s;hewn in Scripture, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church, and the forms and ordin|ances thereof, did &s;hadow forth, and typify heaven|ly things, <HI>Heb.</HI> viii. 2&mdash;6. and ix. 9, 23, 24, &amp;c.

Therefore from hence I con|clude, that as outward cleanne&s;s was nece&s;&s;ary in order for circumci&s;ion; and none might partake of it without; &s;o that &s;piritual cleanne&s;s is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary now, in order for any to receive Bapti&s;m, or the Lord's Supper aright.&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e brief hints may furni&s;h us with an ea&s;y an&s;wer to many objections, that are often urged again&s;t our refu&s;ing to give the&s;e precious ordi|nances to the unconverted. I &s;hall &s;peak more par|ticulary as to Bapti&s;m, and that will &s;ufficiently an&s;wer the other; for none will plead for per&s;ons coming to the Lord's Supper, who have not a right to Bapti&s;m.</P>

<HI>Abraham</HI> &s;tood in a double capacity.&mdash;As he &s;tood per&s;onally before God, the covenant of grace was no more made with him, than with any &s;aint in the world.

<P N="1">1. His natural &s;eed, which includes all that de|&s;cended from his loins: The&s;e were all taken into that typical covenant: and they had the privilege of the oracles of God, and the outward ordinances of his wori&s;hip, which no other nation then enjoy'd: they had the promi&s;e of the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and of many outward ble&s;&s;ings there; and in conclu&s;ion that Chri&s;t &s;hould come out of that nation;&mdash; and they had the fir&s;t offer of the go&s;pel <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 1, 2, and 9, 4, 5.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t is <HI>Abraham</HI>'s &s;eed, <HI>in whom all the fa|milies of the earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Gal. iii. 16. and &s;undry of them ancient promi&s;es evidently point directly to him, in whom alone they are fulfilled.</P>

And &s;o that text is limited in <HI>Act.</HI> ii. 39. which is &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted upon. <HI>The promi&s;e is unto you and to your children, and to all that are afar off,</HI> EVEN as MANY <HI>as the Lord our God &s;hall call.</HI> There is the limits; as many of us, and of our children as are effectually called, are <HI>heirs of promi&s;e,</HI> and no others. <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 17, 18, and ix. 15.

church, which is evident becau&s;e, if they were not circumci&s;ed, they mu&s;t be cut off from their people. (<HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 14.) which could not be if they were not in; for there is no ca&s;ting any out of the church that are not in it. Which if it be the ca&s;e now un|der the go&s;pel, then we have a fle&s;hly and not a &s;piritual church, directly contrary to many texts that I have mentioned, and &s;cores more that might be brought to the fame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Here &s;ome bring <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. to prove that the li|mits of the church &s;tand the &s;ame now as formerly, only is changed into different hands. Becau&s;e from a &s;imilitude of the <HI>olive-tree,</HI> is repre&s;ented the re|jection of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the reception of the <HI>Gen|tiles,</HI> to partake of that which is called the <HI>root and fatne&s;s of the olive-tree;</HI> which they take to be a partaking of the &s;ame, or like, external, as well as internal, privileges: from whence is argued the right of profe&s;&s;ors now to baptize their children, becau&s;e the <HI>Jews</HI> circumci&s;ed theirs.&mdash;But by the root and olive-tree, I under&s;tand, <HI>Abraham</HI> typi|cally, and Chri&s;t &s;piritually, who is plainly pointed at in ver. 26.27. He <HI>is the vine,</HI> his people <HI>are the branches.</HI> (Joh. xv. 5.) The <HI>Jews</HI> were broken off thro' unbelief, and the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ffed in, and &s;tand only by <HI>faith.</HI> ver. 20. So that what appears from hence is, that true faith is ab&s;olutey nece&s;&s;ary, in order for any &s;oul now to partake of the&s;e great ble&s;&s;ings, de&s;cribed by the root, and fatne&s;s of the olive; which ble&s;&s;ings the <HI>Jews</HI> lo&s;t by unbelief, though it is called <HI>their own olive-tree,</HI> ver. 24. and they had the fir&s;t offer of grace when Chri&s;t came.&mdash;</P>
<P>Therefore whatever privileges are intended by the root, and fatne&s;s of the olive, it is evident that as the branch mu&s;t have a living union to the tree.

or vine, in order to receive nouri&s;hment therefrom; &s;o every per&s;on, both great and &s;mall, mu&s;t by faith be united to Chri&s;t, in order to partake of them favours: which &s;hews, that no arguments can be drawn from hence to prove that any others are &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m but real &s;aints.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. But it is evident that in old time, God did grant to the children of tho&s;e who were emi|nently godly, many favours and privileges that he did not to others: and &s;o the prophet &s;peaking concerning the la&s;t times, tells the &s;aints that they &s;hall be <HI>the &s;eed of the ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord, and their off-&s;pring with them,</HI> I&s;a. lxv. 23. and there is much more in Scripture to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; from whence we cannot but think, that children now are taken into covenant with their parents, and therefore have a right to bapti&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The fir&s;t part of this objection is undoubted truth, but the con&s;equence drawn from it, I think has no foundation in &s;cripture: for a great part of the favours thus granted, are only of a temporal nature; and that not only to children, but al&s;o to other friends round. Thus for in&s;tance, not only <HI>Noah</HI>'s and <HI>Lot</HI>'s children were &s;aved from being drowned and burnt up: but <HI>Rahab</HI> the harlots fa|ther and mother, brothers and &s;i&s;ters, al&s;o were pre&s;erved from being &s;lain, for her &s;ake, becau&s;e &s;he received the &s;pies with peace. <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> ii. 13. and 6.23, 24.&mdash;And how often does God &s;peak of pre|&s;erving the kingdom, and the privileges of it, in the hands of the po&s;terity of <HI>David</HI> his &s;ervant, for their fathers &s;ake. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 11.13, 32, 34, 36. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 21.7. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 37.35. So that it appears that a great part of the favours, thus given are of a temporal nature, which no ways entitles to go&s;pel church privileges:&mdash;If it did, parents or brethren
<PB N="26" REF="007613_0030_102BA95C09493668">
of the godly might claim a right to them, as well as children, Yet.</P>
<P N="2">2. If any &s;piritual favours are &s;hewn to children for their parents &s;ake, they are either the advantage of their godly examples, coun&s;els and in&s;tructions, and the enjoyment of the outward means of grace, (<HI>chiefly becau&s;e unto them are committed the oracles of God.</HI> Rom. iii.&mdash;) Or el&s;e out of regard to his &s;aints, and in an&s;wer to their prayers, the Lord is pleas'd to power out his &s;pirit on them, and &s;aving|ly turn 'em to him&s;elf: then we readily own that they have a right to all the privileges of the &s;ons of God.&mdash;<HI>I will pour my &s;pirit upon thy &s;eed, and my ble&s;&s;ing upon thine off-&s;pring:</HI>&mdash; What then is the con&s;equence? why, <HI>one &s;hall &s;ay, I am the Lords: and another &s;hall call him&s;elf by the name of</HI> Jacob: <HI>and another &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe with his hand unto the Lord, and &s;ir-name him&s;elf by the name of</HI> I&s;rael. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> xliv. 3, 5. Note, fir&s;t God's &s;pirit is pour'd upon 'em, and then they openly confe&s;s him. But what proof is there from hence, that unconverted children have a right to church privileges? The Lord in comforting Zion, in I&s;a. liv. 13. &s;ays, <HI>All thy children &s;hall be taught of God:</HI> which chapter the apo&s;tle quotes in our context, to de&s;cribe the free-woman; and then adds, <HI>We, brethren are her chil|dren:</HI> all which &s;hews, that the churches children in a go&s;pel &s;en&s;e, are only real &s;aints. The &s;ame appears al&s;o from what God &s;aid to <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> con|cerning the new covenant, that he would make with his people: not according to the covenant that he made with <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when they came out of <HI>Egypt:</HI> which new covenant, is a writing his law in their hearts, &amp;c. and in de&s;cribing the extent of it, he &s;ays, <HI>They &s;hall all know me, from the lea&s;t of them, unto the greate&s;t of them, &s;aith the Lord: for I will

forgive their iniquity; and I will remember their &s;in no more.</HI> From which it is evident to a demon|&s;tration, that none are actually in the covenant, but &s;uch as know God, and have their &s;ins forgiven. This is applied to the go&s;pel-&s;tate in <HI>Heb.</HI> viii.</P>
<P>Further let it be ob&s;erved, that this point, of fa|vours being &s;hewn to children for their godly pa|rents &s;ake, was no ways confined to circumci&s;ion of old, becau&s;e it appears before, in the time, and after that was in&s;tituted.&mdash;<HI>Before,</HI> it appeared in <HI>Noah</HI>'s family, as ob&s;erved above.&mdash;<HI>In the time</HI> of it, we may &s;ee the &s;ame in <HI>Lot</HI>'s hou&s;e, and that not only to his immediate off-&s;pring, but al&s;o many genera|tions after, God &s;hews &s;ome regard to his po&s;terity for his &s;ake, <HI>Deut.</HI> ii. 9, 19. Yet none of them were circumci&s;ed.&mdash;And <HI>after</HI> circumci&s;ion was in&s;ti|tuted in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the &s;ame appears without any &s;pe|cial reference to that, as may be &s;een in the family of <HI>Phinehas, David,</HI> and others, though all the re&s;t of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were circumci&s;ed as well as they: which proves that God's be&s;towing &s;ome favours on &s;aints children, that he did'nt to others of old, never could argue any right to circumci&s;ion, without an expre&s;s command: then &s;urely no proof can from hence be drawn for baptizing believers &s;eed now, without the plain direction of the lawgiver.</P>
<P>Object. 4. According to this, you make as tho' &s;aints in go&s;pel-times have not &s;o great privileges as they had under the law: but we believe them to be greater now than then.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. In order to &s;olve this difficulty, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider what were truly the privi|leges that they enjoy'd, under the law. And <HI>Paul</HI> plainly &s;hews that their chief privileges were the en|joyment of the oracles of God. <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 1, 2. which were as means for their conver&s;ion and &s;alvation:
<PB N="28" REF="007613_0032_102BA95DDD112D68">
and that they might not partake of the&s;e means without being circumci&s;ed is manife&s;t, becau&s;e that Chri&s;t him&s;elf when he &s;ent out his apo&s;tles before he had by his death aboli&s;hed the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> ceremo|nies, forbid their preaching to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> or <HI>Sa|maritans,</HI> but only to the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> Matt. x. 5, 6.

<P>Should any here &s;ay that Bapti&s;m is a means for conver&s;ion, and as &s;uch ought to be u&s;ed for chil|dren. I reply, that I conceive this was the footing upon which the baptizing of infants was fir&s;t intro|duced into the world: though I don't pretend to be much acquainted with the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times, yet I gather this from the account that <HI>Paedobapti&s;ts</HI> them&s;elves give of this affair. Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> in his late defence of the divine right of Infant-Bapti&s;m: though he can produce no expre&s;s mention of in|fants being baptized in the two fir&s;t hundred years after Chri&s;t; yet he would per&s;wade us that the fathers of the third century had the apo&s;tles minds and practice right in this matter, who plainly men|tion it. But one of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages that he cites is from St. <HI>Origen</HI> in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>It is for that rea&s;on becau&s;e by the &s;acrament of Bapti&s;m the <HI>pollution of our birth is taken away,</HI> that infants are baptized.</Q> P. 111. And hence they frequently called Bapti&s;m, <HI>regeneration:</HI> which language the church of <HI>England</HI> retain to this day. But if all were regenerated who are &s;prinkled in infancy, &s;urely we &s;hould &s;ee other men of them, than multitudes of them appear to be. And the notion of the pollution of our births, being wa&s;hed away by this outward application of water, looks &s;o ab&s;urd, that I would per&s;wade my&s;elf that 'tis need|le&s;s

Says he, <Q>It is not the end of Bapti&s;m to regenerate, 1. Be|cau&s;e then there would be no rea&s;on why it &s;hould be confined only to the &s;eed of believers, for both the law of God, and the nature of cha|rity requires us to u&s;e the means of conver&s;ion for all, as far as we can have opportunity. Were this true, no &s;uch charity as to catch the children of the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Heathens,</HI> and baptize them, and di&s;patch them to heaven out of hand, like the bloody wretches that made the poor prote&s;|tants (to &s;ave their lives) &s;wear they would come to <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> and that they would never depart from it, and then put them forthwith to death &s;aying, <HI>They would hang them while in a good mind.</HI> 2. Becau&s;e it pre-&s;uppo&s;eth regeneration, and therefore can't be intended to confer it.

<P>I al&s;o ob&s;erve in Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> that there is as early mention of <HI>Godfathers,</HI> and <HI>Godmothers</HI> as there is of infants right to Bapti&s;m. P. 105. He likewi&s;e &s;peaks of a di&s;pute that after ro&s;e among the church|es whether infants might be baptized as &s;oon as they were born, or not till eight days old; which affair was &s;ettled by a council in <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s time.

<P>What has been &s;aid may be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer that objection that is often urged, <HI>viz.</HI> That chil|dren were once in covenant, and where were they cut off?

<PB N="35" REF="007613_0039_102BA9309B60AAC0">
what was to come: Whereas the ordinances of the new, are open declarations of what is actually done. Thus for in&s;tance, in the Lord's &s;upper, we do <HI>&s;hew forth the Lord's Death:</HI> or from time to time, hold up a publick witne&s;s to the world that Chri&s;t has really died for &s;inners; and this we are to continue in the practice of, till his &s;econd coming. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. 26.</P>

<P>This view I conceive may give us a true idea of that text which is con&s;iderably u&s;ed in this affair. <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 11. <HI>And he received the &s;ign of circum|ci&s;ion, a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the faith.</HI>&mdash; From whence many conclude, that the covenant of circumci&s;ion was the pure covenant of grace: and that circumci&s;ion then, and bapti&s;m now are &s;eals thereof. But you may ob&s;erve, that what the apo|&s;tle is upon, is proving that great point of our ju&s;ti|fication by faith alone: and he brings in the in|&s;tance of <HI>Abraham</HI> as an evidence in the ca&s;e, and &s;hews that he was ju&s;tified by faith, without the deeds of the law. Upon this there ari&s;es another que&s;tion, which is, whether this great ble&s;&s;ings comes only on the circumci&s;ion, or on others al&s;o? to decide which he takes a review of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s ca&s;e; from whence it appears that <HI>Abraham</HI> him|&s;elf
<PB N="36" REF="007613_0040_102BA967629E9450">

<P>Circumci&s;ion (as has been &s;hewn) was a &s;ign of what was to come; but <HI>Abraham</HI> had the thing &s;ignified then wrought in his &s;oul; &s;o that he had both the type and antetype, and thus it was to him a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the faith which he then had: but how could it be a &s;eal to <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> and thou&s;ands of others of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the faith which they had not?&mdash;The apo&s;tle from hence goes on to &s;hew that thus &s;tanding, <HI>Abraham</HI> was a father to all that believ'd, tho' not circum|ci&s;ed: and a father to tho&s;e of the <HI>Jews</HI> that were not only circumci&s;ed; but al&s;o walked in the &s;ame faith that he had before he was circumci&s;ed; which brings out ju&s;t the &s;ame thing, that has been ob&s;erved be|fore, <HI>viz.</HI> that typically he was father of all that church, both believers and unbelievers, and &s;piri|tually he is the father of all the &s;aints, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And without this di&s;tinction it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture together.</P>

This leaves men at a lo&s;s about how large the church is; and who have a right to its ordinances. Some hold, that church members &s;hould baptize both their children and their &s;ervants; only it mu&s;t be &s;uch as are young: yet then they can never tell exactly, what age to fix.&mdash;Numbers there are, who in&s;i&s;t upon all baptized children's coming to the Lord's Supper at &s;ixteen years old, if not openly

But we are commanded in any wi&s;e to rebuke our neighbour, and not &s;uffer &s;in upon him; and to reprove even the unfruitful works of darkne&s;s, and would you ca&s;t 'em out from this? that is a great length in|deed.</P>

The limits of the old church are expre&s;t as plain by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as they were to <HI>Abraham.</HI>&mdash;If any man would join with that church and come to the pa&s;&s;over, he mu&s;t have all his males circumci&s;ed: and every man's &s;ervant, bought with money, when he was circum|ci&s;ed, then &s;hould he eat the pa&s;&s;over. A foreign and an hired &s;ervant might not eat thereof: but all the congregation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;hould keep it. <HI>Exod.</HI> xii. 44,&mdash;48. There are the bounds &s;et exactly; and as plain are they in the new-te&s;tament.

Then &s;urely 'tis of infinite importance for each &s;oul to know which mother they belong to: and the &s;crip|tures have given many plain marks whereby we may come to know how our ca&s;e is.&mdash;For brevity's &s;ake I &s;hall in&s;tance in but one, which is that, <HI>If thou art a child of the free-woman, it is become thy</HI> LI|BERTY <HI>to walk in holine&s;s.</HI> Herein lies a &s;pecial difference between the lea&s;t chri&s;tian and the great|e&s;t hypocrite in the world. Both of them pay &s;ome regard to the &s;ame commands, and in many things their external walk may appear alike: but then the &s;prings and motives of their obedience are va&s;tly different. The hypocrite &s;ometimes does things to be &s;een of men, though what mo&s;t commonly moves him, is fear of hell if he neglects duty, and hopes of e&s;caping it by his performances. Hence you'll often hear them pleading, that 'tis dangerous for per&s;ons to be too confident; and that 'tis need|ful for to always have &s;ome fear of mi&s;carrying at la&s;t, le&s;t we &s;hould grow remi&s;s and carele&s;s in duty; and &s;ome will plainly &s;ay, that if the doctrine which many hold concerning per&s;everance and a&s;&s;urance is true, and if they knew that they were in Chri&s;t, and &s;hould never peri&s;h, they would not care how they lived, for all would end well at la&s;t. But how plainly do the&s;e men di&s;cover them&s;elves to be chil|dren of the bond-woman, for they look no further than their ways, or to e&s;cape the whip? We all know that the greater confirmations an obedient child has of his father's love, and the &s;ecurity of his favour, the more chearful, active and diligent he
<PB N="41" REF="007613_0045_102BA937D88B5B10">
will be in doing his father's will, and careful not to do any thing to offend him. And &s;ince it is &s;o often a&s;&s;erted, that &s;aints love and delight in God's law, how can any rational &s;oul, (if they would let rea&s;on, in&s;tead of their own experience decide the ca&s;e) imagine that clear di&s;coveries of God's love and favour, would make men le&s;s careful to &s;erve him!&mdash;Don't we all know that what men love and delight in, they will &s;eek and per&s;ue after, without being drove? as for in&s;tance, food that we love, we labour for earne&s;tly, and eat of it frequently, without being told that we &s;hall die if we don't. And <HI>Job</HI> &s;ays, that he <HI>e&s;teemed the words of God's mouth more than his nece&s;&s;ary food.</HI> chap. xxiii, 12. and <HI>David</HI> counted the divine law, to be <HI>&s;weeter than the honey-comb&punc;</HI> P&s;al. xix. 10. Al&s;o <HI>per&s;ons</HI> that we love;&mdash;without driving, we &s;eek all op|portunities to enjoy their company. So will all tho&s;e that truly love God, and his &s;aints,&mdash;yea &s;uch as love the riches, honours, or plea&s;ures of this world, not only voluntarily run after them, but they al&s;o earne&s;tly crave a great deal of them: and &s;o do tho&s;e who love Chri&s;t and holine&s;s; and they that are content with a little degree of grace; never knew the glory and excellency of divine things. <HI>David</HI> &s;ays, <HI>I &s;hall be &s;atisfied when I awake with thy likene&s;s.</HI> P&s;al. xvii. 15. Nothing &s;hort of this can fill the de&s;ires of a gracious &s;oul. The fir&s;t epi&s;tle of <HI>John</HI> is peculiarly calculated to detect li|centious hypocrites, and to pre&s;s home a holy life upon all profe&s;&s;ors of religion: and ob&s;erve well the beloved di&s;ciples method.&mdash;<HI>My little children, the&s;e things write I unto you, that ye &s;in not.</HI>&mdash;But what if they &s;hould happen to be en&s;nared in &s;in? does he then &s;et the terrors of hell before them? No, he pre&s;ents the grace and ble&s;&s;ings of heaven;

&mdash;<HI>If any man &s;in, we have an Advocate with the father;</HI>&mdash;and <HI>if we confe&s;s our &s;ins, he is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> chap. i. 9. and ii. 1. And further to attain this glorious end, he &s;ets &s;aints to admiring the wondrous love of God in taking them to be his children, and a&s;&s;erts that now they are the &s;ons of God, but what they &s;hall be advanced to, does not yer appear; but &s;ays he, <HI>We</HI> KNOW <HI>that when he &s;hall appear, we &s;hall be like him; for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is.</HI> There is the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;u|rance expre&s;t; but will that make them &s;lack in their obedience? No, quite the contrary, for <HI>every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth him&s;elf, even as he is pure;</HI>&mdash;and he declares, that he that can run on in &s;in, <HI>Hath not &s;een</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>neither known him.</HI> chap. iii. 1, 2, 3, 6. And now, are not hypocrites a&s;hamed of their notion that a&s;&s;urance is a licentious doctrine?&mdash;O my readers, I intreat and charge you before God, who &s;hall judge us all, to &s;earch critically your own hearts, and &s;ee whether you are governed by a &s;pirit of bondage, and &s;lavi&s;h fear, or by the &s;pirit of adoption, whereby you can cry <HI>Abba Father.</HI> Rom. viii. 15.&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hall only an&s;wer a &s;cruple that may ari&s;e here in &s;ome gracious &s;ouls, and then di&s;mi&s;s this head.&mdash; Methinks I hear &s;ome &s;uch &s;ay, <Q>Alas, I fear that I am a child of the bond-woman, for I often drag on heavily in duty, and I feel my heart &s;o dull and backward to &s;piritual exerci&s;es, that I can't think there is any grace in it.</Q> But this &s;hort que&s;tion may ea&s;ily decide the ca&s;e, viz. Is it the divine command which are burden&s;ome to thee, or thy vile heart that often hinders thee from doing the things that thou woulde&s;t?&mdash;God's &s;ervice is a <HI>Wearine&s;s</HI> to hypocrites. <HI>Amos</HI> viii. 5. <HI>Mal.</HI> i. 13.

But &s;aints delight in his law after the inward man, tho' they find a law in their members warring a|gain&s;t it. <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. 21, 22, 23. Carefully ob&s;erve this di&s;tinction, and you may come to know what your condition is.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, I &s;hall clo&s;e with a &s;hort addre&s;s to two or three &s;orts of per&s;ons. And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> to tho&s;e that hold the contrary from me concerning the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, many of whom are very near to me. <HI>My dear friends,</HI> it may be &s;ome of you will be offended, and others grieved with me, when you &s;ee the foregoing lines. But I think I can truly &s;ay, that 'tis not out of bitterne&s;s, but rather out of love to you, that I have pen'd what you here &s;ee. Therefore I would only beg this one favour of you, namely, that you would candidly weigh what is here &s;aid, in the balances of the &s;anctuary, before you cen&s;ure or ca&s;t it by: and in order for this, let the characters of all that have held the one &s;ide or the other of this principle be put intirely out of the que&s;tion, or you'll never come to the right of the ca&s;e. That there have been good Men of both &s;entiments is no &s;cruple to me, and I believe not to you neither; and 'tis as evident that there has been bad men on both &s;ides: and &s;hould you try to find out which had the greate&s;t number, it would be little to the purpo&s;e. &mdash;The mi&s;chiefs that I have found by experience in the&s;e things makes me caution you again&s;t them. <HI>David</HI> was a man of a much better character than <HI>Jacob;</HI> yet <HI>Jacob</HI> had the right of the ca&s;e concern|ing numbering the people. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxi.&mdash;There|fore let us all obey the divine command to <HI>cea&s;e from man,</HI> viewing that all fle&s;h is but fadeing gra&s;s: and be willing that this matter &s;hould be decided alone by <HI>the word of our God that &s;hall &s;tand for ever.</HI> (I&s;a. ii. 22. and xl. 8.) And if after a dili|gent

&s;earching of the &s;criptures, you &s;till remain of a different mind from me; yet &s;till remember that to his own ma&s;ter each &s;oul &s;tands or falls, and &s;o forbare all bitter cen&s;ures. And O that each one would with greater earne&s;tne&s;s <HI>forget the things that are behind, and pre&s;s towards the glorious mark;</HI> believing that wherein we are differently minded, God &s;hall in his own time reveal the whole truth unto us. <HI>Phill.</HI> iii. 14, 15. Oh, when &s;hall that ble&s;&s;ed day come, when &s;aints will have done with all mi&s;under&s;tandings of each other; when they &s;hall all join with one heart and &s;oul to prai&s;e our glorious King for ever and ever.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay a word to &s;uch as are of my &s;entiments concerning bapti&s;m.&mdash;Brethren, what I have to &s;peak to you is, <HI>Live up to your principles.</HI> &mdash;How inexcu&s;able will tho&s;e appear, who in&s;i&s;t upon it that per&s;ons mu&s;t believe in order to be baptized; and yet admit &s;uch to this ordinance who give no proper evidence of any thing more than an hi&s;torical or doctrinal faith? whereas a believing with all the heart is nece&s;&s;ary to give a right there|to. <HI>Act.</HI> viii. 37. And though God alone can &s;earch the heart; yet <HI>fruits</HI> of <HI>repentance</HI> &s;hould be care|fully looked after in this ca&s;e.&mdash;And as little excu&s;e can be found for them, that while they plead that we mu&s;t be <HI>buried with Chri&s;t in Bapti&s;m,</HI> yet be|have as though &s;in lived and reigned in their hearts &s;till, in&s;tead of being <HI>dead indeed unto &s;in, but alive unto God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> Rom. vi. 4, 11. Therefore let none while they profe&s;s to know God, deny him in works: but be exhorted &s;o to walk as to <HI>adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</HI>&mdash;This would have a much greater ten|dency to bring others to imbrace the truth in the&s;e things, than many warm di&s;putes without a good life. 'Tis not ea&s;y to imagine how much u&s;e is
<PB N="45" REF="007613_0049_102BA98D52FF0D68">
made of the corrupt lives of numbers of tho&s;e in the land who are called <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> to bar the minds of thou&s;ands again&s;t <HI>receiv|ing,</HI> or even candidly <HI>weighing</HI> and <HI>examining</HI> what I firmly be|lieve are truths which they hold. And tho' I am not excu&s;ing &s;uch conduct; yet I would earne&s;tly per&s;wade you all as much as may be to <HI>cut off occa&s;ion from tho&s;e that de&s;ire occa&s;ion</HI> thus to treat the truth and them that hold it. And if others &s;ay that we di&s;regard, and are cruel to our children, becau&s;e we don't baptize them before they are converted: let each head of a family, walk in his hou&s;e with a perfect heart, and behave &s;o towards the little ones that God has given him, as to evidence that he has a much greater regard for the &s;piritual, than the temporal welfare of his children.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I will clo&s;e with a word to all the children of the bond-woman, <HI>My dear fellow Men,</HI> be intreated to con&s;ider how &s;ad your ca&s;e and condition is. If you flouri&s;h in the world more than the &s;aints, and are let alone to live as you li&s;t: this is but a mi&s;erable portion, which pre&s;ently will be all &s;tript from you, and God will &s;ay, <HI>How much they have glorified them|&s;elves, and lived deliciou&s;ly, &s;o much torment and &s;orrow give them.</HI> Jam. 5&mdash; Rev. 18.7.&mdash;Many of you are ready to think, that there is too much ado made about religion, and can laugh at the devotions of the godly. But Oh! remember and take warning by your old father <HI>I&s;hmael:</HI> he made a <HI>mock</HI> of his fathers joy, in &s;eeing the accompli&s;hment of God's promi&s;e; which is here (ver. 29) call'd <HI>per&s;ecution,</HI> for which he was <HI>ca&s;t out,</HI> not on|ly from his fathers hou&s;e, but al&s;o from the ble&s;&s;ings of Salvation, which he had de&s;pi&s;ed. <HI>Now therefore be ye not mockers lea&s;t your bands, be made &s;trong,</HI> (I&s;a. 28, 22) but fly to Chri&s;t, that your &s;ouls may live.&mdash; And are there any of you that are &s;eeking help by the life of your own hands; how does Chri&s;t expo&s;tu|late with you (<HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55.2, 3) &s;aying, <HI>Wherefore do ye &s;pend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which &s;atisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your Soul delight it&s;elf in fatne&s;s. Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear and your &s;ouls &s;hall live, and I will make an everla&s;ting covenant with you, even the &s;ure mercies of</HI> David. AMEN.</P>
