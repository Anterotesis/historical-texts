<HEAD>A CAUTION AND WARNING &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AT a time when the general rights and liberties of mankind, and the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e va|luable privileges tran&s;mitted to us from our ance&s;tors, are become &s;o much the &s;ubjects of univer&s;al con&s;ideration; can it be an inquiry indifferent to any, how many of tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves as the Advocates of Liberty, remain in&s;en&s;ible and inatten|tive to the treatment of thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands of our fellow-men, who, from motives of avarice, and the inexorable degree of tyrant cu&s;tom, are at this ve|ry time kept in the mo&s;t deplorable &s;tate of &s;lavery, in many parts of the Briti&s;h Dominions.</P>
<P>The intent of publi&s;hing the following &s;heets, is more fully to make known the aggravated iniquity attending the practice of the Slave-Trade; whereby many thou&s;ands of our fellow-creatures, as free as our&s;elves by nature, and equally with us the &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t's redeeming grace, are yearly brought into inextricable and barbarous bondage; and many, very many, to mi&s;erable and untimely ends.</P>
<P>The truth of this lamentable complaint is &s;o obvious to per&s;ons of candour, under who&s;e notice it hath fallen, that &s;everal have lately publi&s;hed their &s;enti|ments thereon; as a matter which calls for the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration of all who are concerned for the civil or religious welfare of their country. How an evil of &s;o deep a dye, hath &s;o long, not only pa&s;&s;ed uninterrupted by Tho&s;e in Power, but hath even had
<PB N="4" REF="010240_0003_0F7E08D840CDA0A0">their countenance, is, indeed, &s;urpri&s;ing, and, charity would &s;uppo&s;e, mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, have ari&s;en from this, that many per&s;ons in government, both of the Clergy and Laity, in who&s;e power it hath been to put a &s;top to the Trade, have been unacquainted with the corrupt motives which gives life to it; and the groans, the dying groans, which daily a&s;cend to God, the common Father of mankind, from the broken hearts of tho&s;e his deeply oppre&s;&s;ed creatures; other|wi&s;e the powers of the earth would not, I think I may venture to &s;ay, could not, have &s;o long authori&s;ed a practice &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with every idea of liberty and ju&s;tice, which, as the learned James Fo&s;ter &s;ays, <HI>Bids that God, which is the God and Father of the Gentiles, unconverted to Chri&s;tianity, mo&s;t daring and hold defiance; and &s;purns at all the principles both of natural and re|vealed Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Much might ju&s;tly be &s;aid of the temporal evils which attend this practice, as it is de&s;tructive of the welfare of human &s;ociety, and of the peace and pro&s;perity of every country, in proportion as it prevails. It might be al&s;o &s;hewn, that it de&s;troys the bonds of natural affection and intere&s;t, whereby mankind in general are united; that it introduces idlene&s;s, di&s;courages marriage, cor|rupts the youth, ruins and debauches morals, excites continual apprehen&s;ions of dangers, and frequent alarms, to which the Whites are nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed from &s;o great an encrea&s;e of a people, that, by their bondage and oppre&s;&s;ions, become natural enemies, yet, at the &s;ame time, are filling the places and eating the bread of tho&s;e who would be the &s;upport and &s;ecurity of the country. But as the&s;e and many more reflections of the &s;ame kind, may occur to a con&s;iderate mind, I &s;hall only endeavour to &s;hew, from the nature of the
<PB N="5" REF="010240_0004_0F7E08D8F5104250">Trade, the plenty which Guinea affords its inhabitants, the barbarous treatment of the Negroes, and the ob|&s;ervations made thereon by authors of note, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the plaine&s;t precepts of the go&s;pel, the dictates of rea&s;on, and every common &s;entiment of humanity.</P>
<P>In an account of the European Setttlements in Ame|rica, printed in London, 1757, the author &s;peaking on this &s;ubject, &s;ays: <Q>The Negroes in our Colonies endure a &s;lavery more compleat and attended with far wor&s;e circum&s;tances than what any people in their condition &s;uffer in any other part of the world, or have &s;uffered in any other period of time: proofs of this are not wanting. The prodigious wa&s;te which we experience in this unhappy part of our &s;pecies, is a full and melancholy evidence of this truth. The I&s;land of Barbados, (the Negroes upon which do not amount to eighty thou&s;and) notwith&s;tanding all the means which they u&s;e to encrea&s;e them by pro|pagation, and that the climate is in every re&s;pect except that of being more whole&s;ome) exactly re|&s;embling the climate from whence they come; not|with&s;tanding all this, Barbados lies under a nece&s;|&s;ity of an annual recruit of five thou&s;and &s;laves, to keep up the &s;tock at the number I have mentioned. This prodigious failure, which is at lea&s;t in the &s;ame proportion in all our I&s;lands, &s;hews demon&s;tratively that &s;ome uncommon and un&s;upportable hard&s;hip lies upon the Negroes, which wears them down in &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;ing manner; and this, I imagine, is principally the exce&s;&s;ive labour which they undergo.</Q> In an account of part of North-America, publi&s;hed by Thomas Jeffery, printed 1761, &s;peaking of the u&s;age the Negroes receive in the We&s;t-India I&s;lands, thus
<PB N="6" REF="010240_0005_0F7E08D9C3BD65C0">expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf: <Q>It's impo&s;&s;ible for a human heart to reflect upon the &s;ervitude of the&s;e dregs of man|kind, without in &s;ome mea&s;ure feeling for their mi|&s;ery, which ends but with their lives.&mdash;Nothing can be more wretched than the condition of this people. One would imagine, they were framed to be the di&s;grace of the human &s;pecies, bani&s;hed from their country, and deprived of that ble&s;&s;ing Liber|ty, on which all other nations &s;et the greate&s;t value, they are in a manner reduced to the condition of bea&s;ts of burden: In general a few roots, potatoes e&s;pecially, are their food, and two rags, which neither &s;creen them from the heat of the day, nor the extra|ordinary coolne&s;s of the night, all their covering; their &s;leep very &s;hort; their labour almo&s;t continual, they receive no wages, but have twenty la&s;hes for the &s;malle&s;t fault.</Q></P>
<P>A con&s;iderate young per&s;on who was late in one of our We&s;t-India I&s;lands, where he ob&s;erved the mi&s;e|rable &s;ituation of the Negroes, makes the following re|marks, <Q>I meet with daily exerci&s;e, to &s;ee the treatment which the&s;e mi&s;erable wretches meet with from their ma&s;ters, with but few exceptions. They whip them mo&s;t unmercifully, on &s;mall occa&s;ions. They beat them with thick clubs, and you will &s;ee their bodies all whaled and &s;carred; in &s;hort, they &s;eem to &s;et no other value on their lives than as they co&s;t them &s;o much money; and are not re&s;trained from kill|ing them, when angry, by a worthier con&s;ideration than that they lo&s;e &s;o much. They act as tho' they did not look upon them as a race of human crea|tures, who have rea&s;on, and remembrance of mi&s;|fortunes, but as bea&s;ts, like oxen, who are &s;tubborn, hardy and &s;en&s;ele&s;s; fit for burdens, and de&s;igned to
<PB N="7" REF="010240_0006_0F7E08DA747FF4E8">bear them. They won't allow them to have any claim to human privileges, or &s;carce, indeed, to be regarded as the work of God. Tho' it was con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice of our Maker to pronounce the &s;entence on our common parent, and thro' him on all &s;ucceeding ge|nerations, <HI>That he and they &s;hould eat their bread by the &s;weat of their brow;</HI> yet, does it not &s;tand record|ed by the &s;ame eternal truth, <HI>That the Labourer is worthy of his hire?</HI> It cannot be allowed in natural ju&s;tice that there &s;hould be a &s;ervitude without con|dition: A cruel endle&s;s &s;ervitude. It cannot be re|concileable to natural ju&s;tice, that whole nations; nay whole continents of men, &s;hould be devoted to do the drudgery of life for others, be dragged away from their attachments of relations and &s;ocieties; and made to &s;erve the appetites and plea&s;ures of a race of men who&s;e &s;uperiority has been obtained by an illegal force.</Q></P>
<P>A particular account of the treatment the&s;e unhap|py Africans receive in the We&s;t-Indies, was lately publi&s;hed, which even by tho&s;e who, blinded by intere&s;t, &s;eek excu&s;es for the Trade, and endeavour to palliate the cruelty exerci&s;ed upon them, is allowed to be a true, tho' rather too favourable repre&s;entation of the u&s;age they receive, which is as follows, viz. <Q>The iniquity of the Slave-trade is greatly aggra|vated by the inhumanity with which the Negroes are treated in the Plantations, as well with re&s;pect to food and cloathing, as from the unrea&s;onable labour which is commonly exacted from them. To which may be added the cruel cha&s;ti&s;ements they frequently &s;uffer, without any other bounds than the will and wrath of their hard ta&s;k-ma&s;ters. In Barbados, and &s;ome other of the I&s;lands, &s;ix pints of Indian corn
<PB N="8" REF="010240_0007_0F7E08DB36DC4BD8">and three herrings are reckoned a full week's allow|ance for a working &s;lave, and in the Sy&s;tem of Geo|graphy it is &s;aid, <HI>That in Jamaica the owners of the Negroe-&s;laves, &s;et a&s;ide for each a parcel of ground, and allow them Sundays to manure it, the produce of which,</HI> with &s;ometimes a few herrings, or other &s;alt fi&s;h, <HI>is all that is allowed for their &s;upport.</HI> Their allowance for cloathing in the I&s;lands is &s;eldom more than &s;ix yards of o&s;enbrigs each year: and in the more northern Colonies, where the piercing we&s;terly winds are long and &s;en&s;ibly felt, the&s;e poor Africans &s;uffer much for want of &s;ufficient cloathing, indeed &s;ome have none till they are able to pay for it by their labour. The time that the Negroes work in the We&s;t-Indies, is from day-break till noon; then again from two o'clock till du&s;k: (during which time they are attended by over&s;eers, who &s;everely &s;courge tho&s;e who appear to them dilatory) and before they are &s;uffered to go to their quarters, they have &s;till &s;omething to do, as collecting of herbage for the hor&s;es, gathering fuel for the boilers, &amp;c. &s;o that it is often half pa&s;t twelve before they can get home, when they have &s;carce time to grind and boil their Indian corn; whereby it often happens that they are called again to labour before they can &s;atisfy their hunger: and here no delay or excu&s;e will avail, for if they are not in the field immediately upon the u&s;ual notice, they mu&s;t expect to feel the over&s;eers la&s;h. In crop-time (which la&s;ts many months) they are obliged (by turns) to work mo&s;t of the night in the boiling-hou&s;e. Thus their owners, from a de&s;ire of making the greate&s;t gain by the labour of their &s;laves, lay heavy burdens on them, and yet feed and clothe them very &s;paringly, and &s;ome &s;carce feed or
<PB N="9" REF="010240_0008_0F7E08DCB4C3B4A8">clothe them at all, &s;o that the poor creatures are obliged to &s;hift for their living in the be&s;t manner they can, which occa&s;ions their being often killed in the neighbouring lands, &s;tealing potatoes, or other food, to &s;atisfy their hunger. And if they take any thing from the plantation they belong to, tho' under &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing want, their owners will correct them &s;everely, for taking a little of what they have &s;o hardly laboured for, whil&s;t they them&s;elves riot in the greate&s;t luxury and exce&s;s.&mdash;It is a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, how a people who, as a nation, are looked upon as generous and humane, and &s;o much value them&s;elves for their uncommon &s;en&s;e of the benefit of Liberty, can live in the practice of &s;uch extreme oppre&s;&s;ion and inhumanity, without &s;eeing the incon&s;i&s;tency of &s;uch conduct, and without feel|ing great remor&s;e: Nor is it le&s;s amazing to hear the&s;e men calmly making calculations about the &s;trength and lives of their fellow-men; in Jamaica, if &s;ix in ten, of the new imported Negroes &s;urvive the &s;ea&s;oning, it is looked upon as a gaining purcha&s;e: And in mo&s;t of the other plantations, if the Negroes live eight or nine years, their labour is reckoned a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for their co&s;t.&mdash;If calcu|lations of this &s;ort were made upon the &s;trength and labour of bea&s;ts of burden it would not appear &s;o &s;trange, but even then a merciful man would cer|tainly u&s;e his bea&s;t with more mercy than is u&s;ually &s;hewn to the poor Negroes.&mdash;Will not the groans of this deeply afflicted and oppre&s;&s;ed people reach heaven, and when the cup of iniquity is full, mu&s;t not the inevitable con&s;equence be pouring forth of the judgments of God upon their oppre&s;&s;ors. But, alas! is it not too manife&s;t that this oppre&s;&s;ion has
<PB N="10" REF="010240_0009_0F7E08DD7608A828">already long been the object of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, for what heavier judgment, what greater calamity can befall any people, than to become a prey to that hardne&s;s of heart, that forgetfulne&s;s of God, and in&s;enbility to every religious impre&s;&s;ion; as well as that general depravation of manners, which &s;o much prevails in the Colonies, in proportion as they have more or le&s;s enriched them&s;elves, at the expence of the blood and bondage of the Negroes.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the Negroes in our Southern pro|vinces on the Continent, is al&s;o feelingly &s;et forth by George Whitefield, in a letter from Georgia, to the inhabitants of Maryland, Virginia, North-and South-Carolina, printed in the year 1739, of which the following is an extract, <Q>As I lately pa&s;&s;ed through your provinces, in my way hither, I was &s;en&s;ibly touched with a fellow-feeling of the mi&s;eries of the poor Ne|groes. Whether it be lawful for Chri&s;tians to buy &s;laves, and thereby encourage the nations from whom they are bought, to be at perpetual war with each other, I &s;hall not take upon me to determine; &s;ure I am, it is &s;inful, when bought, to u&s;e them as bad, nay wor&s;e, than as though they were brutes; and whatever particular exception there may be, (as I would charitably hope there are &s;ome) I fear the generality of you, that own Negroes, are liable to &s;uch a charge; for your &s;laves, I believe, work as hard, if not harder, than the hor&s;es whereon you ride. The&s;e, after they have done their work, are fed and taken proper care of; but many Negroes, when wea|ried with labour, in your plantations, have been obliged to grind their own corn, after they return home; your dogs are care&s;&s;ed and fondled at your tables; but your &s;laves, who are frequently &s;tiled
<PB N="11" REF="010240_0010_0F7E08E1A67A24B8">dogs or bea&s;ts, have not an equal privilege; they are &s;carce permitted to pick up the crumbs which fall from their ma&s;ter's table.&mdash;Not to mention what numbers have been given up to the inhuman u&s;age of cruel talk-ma&s;ter, who, by their unrelenting &s;courges, have ploughed their backs, and made long furrows, and at length brought them even to death. When pa&s;&s;ing along, I have viewed your plantations cleared and cultivated, many &s;pacious hou&s;es built, and the owners of them faring &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, my blood has frequently almo&s;t run cold with|in me, to con&s;ider how many of your &s;laves had neither convenient food to eat, or proper raiment to put on, notwith&s;tanding mo&s;t of the comforts you enjoy were &s;olely owing to their indefatigable la|bours.&mdash;The Scripture &s;ays, Thou &s;halt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. Does God take care for oxen; and will he not take care of the Ne|groes al&s;o? undoubtedly he will.&mdash;Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for your mi&s;eries that &s;hall come upon you: Behold the provi&s;ion of the poor Negroes, who have reaped down your fields, which is by you denied them, crieth; and the cries of them, which reaped, are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. We have a remarkable in|&s;tance of God's taking cognizance of, and avenging the quarrel of poor &s;laves, 2 Sam. xxi. 1. There was a famine in the days of David, three years, year af|ter year; and David enquired of the Lord: And the Lord an&s;wered, It is for Saul, and his bloody hou&s;e, becau&s;e he &s;lew the Gibeonites. Two things are here very remarkable: Fir&s;t, The&s;e Gibeonites were only hewers of wood and drawers of water, or in other words, &s;laves like yours. Secondly, That
<PB N="12" REF="010240_0011_0F7E08E2163FD4D0">this plague was &s;ent by God many years after the injury, the cau&s;e of the plague, was committed. And for what end were this and &s;uch like examples recorded in holy Scriptures, without doubt, for our learning.&mdash;For God is the &s;ame to-day, as he was ye&s;terday, and will continue the &s;ame for ever. He does not reject the prayer of the poor and de&s;titute; nor di&s;regard the cry of the meane&s;t Negro. The blood of them &s;pilt for tho&s;e many years in your re|&s;pective provinces will a&s;cend up to heaven again&s;t you.</Q></P>
<P>Some who have only &s;een Negroes in an abject &s;tate of &s;lavery, broken-&s;pirited and dejected, knowing nothing of their &s;ituation in their native country, may apprehend, that they are naturally un&s;en&s;ible of the benefits of Liberty, being de&s;titute and mi&s;erable in every re&s;pect, and that our &s;uffering them to live among&s;t us (as the Gibeonites of old were permitted to live with the I&s;raelites) tho' even on more oppre&s;|&s;ive term, is to them a favour; but the&s;e are certainly erroneous opinions, with re&s;pect to far the greate&s;t part of them: Altho' it is highly probable that in a country which is more than three thou&s;and miles in extent from north to &s;outh, and as much from ea&s;t to we&s;t, there will be barren parts, and many inhabitants more uncivilized and barbarous than others; as is the ca&s;e in all other countries: Yet, from the mo&s;t authentic accounts, the inhabitants of Guinea appear, generally &s;peaking, to be an indu&s;trious, humane, &s;ociable people, who&s;e capacities are naturally as enlarged, and as open to improvement, as tho&s;e of the Europeans; and that their Country is fruitful, and in many places well im|proved, abounding in cattle, grain and fruits: And as the earth yields all the year round a fre&s;h &s;upply of
<PB N="13" REF="010240_0012_0F7E08E39B8CB430">food, and but little cloathing is requi&s;ite, by rea&s;on of the continual warmth of the climate; the nece&s;&s;aries of life are much ea&s;ter procured in mo&s;t parts of Afri|ca, than in our more northern climes. This is con|firmed by many authors of note, who have re&s;ided there; among others M. Adan&s;on, in his account of Gor&eacute;e and Senegal, in the year 1754, &s;ays, <Q>Which way &s;oever I turned my eyes on this plea&s;ant &s;pot, I beheld a perfect image of pure nature; an agree|able &s;olitude, bounded on every &s;ide by charming land&s;capes, the rural &s;ituation of cottages in the mid&s;t of trees; the ea&s;e and indolence of the Ne|groes reclined under the &s;hade of their &s;preading foliage; the &s;implicity of their dre&s;s and manners; the whole revived in my mind the idea of our fir&s;t parents, and I &s;eemed to contemplate the world in its primitive &s;tate: they are, generally &s;peaking, ve|ry good-natured, &s;ociable and obliging. I was not a little plea&s;ed with this my fir&s;t reception; it con|vinced me, that there ought to be a con&s;iderable abatement made in the accounts I had read and heard every-where of the &s;avage character of the Africans. I ob&s;erved, both in Negroes and Moors, great hu|manity and &s;ociablene&s;s, which gave me &s;trong hopes, that I &s;hould be very &s;afe among&s;t them, and meet with the &s;ucce&s;s I de&s;ired, in my inquiries after the curio&s;ities of the country.</Q></P>
<P>William Bo&s;man, a principal factor for the Dutch, who re&s;ided &s;ixteen years in Guinea, &s;peaking of the natives of that part, where he then was, &s;ays, <Q>They are generally a good &s;ort of people, hone&s;t in their dealings;' others he de&s;cribes as 'being generally friendly to &s;trangers, of a mild conver&s;ation, affable and ea&s;y to be overcome with rea&s;on.' He adds,
<PB N="14" REF="010240_0013_0F7E08E4391FE6C0">That &s;ome Negroes, who have had an agreeable education, have manife&s;ted a brightne&s;s of under|&s;tanding equal to any of us.' Speaking of the fruit|fulne&s;s of the country, he &s;ays, 'It was very populous, plentifully provided with corn, potatoes and fruit, which grew clo&s;e to each other; in &s;ome places a foot-path is the only ground that is not covered with them; the Negroes leaving no place, which is thought fertile, uncultivated; and immediately af|ter they have reaped, they are &s;ure to &s;ow again.' Other parts he de&s;cribes, as 'being full of towns and villages; the &s;oil very rich, and &s;o well cultivated as to look like an entire garden, abounding in rice, corn, oxen and poultry, and the inhabitants labo|rious.</Q></P>
<P>William Smith, who was &s;ent by the African Com|pany to vi&s;it their &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Guinea, in the year 1726, gives much the &s;ame accout of the country of Delmina and Cape Cor&s;e, &amp;c. for beauty and goodne&s;s, and adds, <Q>The more you come down|ward towards that part, called Slave-Coa&s;t, the more delightful and rich the &s;oil appears.' Speaking of their di&s;po&s;ition, he &s;ays, 'They were a civil, good-natured people, indu&s;trious to the la&s;t degree. It is ea&s;y to perceive what happy memories they are ble&s;&s;ed with, and how great progre&s;s they would make in the &s;ciences, in ca&s;e their genius was culti|vated with &s;tudy.' He adds, from the information he received of one of the Factors, who had re&s;ided ten years in that country, 'That the di&s;cerning natives account it their greate&s;t unhappine&s;s, that they were ever vi&s;ited by the Europeans.&mdash;That the Chri&s;|tians introduced the Traffick of Slaves; and that be|fore our coming they lived in peace.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="010240_0014_0F7E08E5066D0CD0">
Andrew Brue, a principal man in the French Fac|tory, in the account he gives of the great river Senegal, which runs many hundred miles up the country, tells his readers, <Q>The farther you go from the &s;ea, the country on the river &s;eems more fruitful and well improved. It abounds in Guinea and Indian corn, rice, pul&s;e, tobacco, and indigo. Here are va&s;t mea|dows, which feed large herds of great and &s;mall cattle; poultry are numerous, as well as wild fowl.' The &s;ame author, in his travels to the &s;outh of the river Gambia, expre&s;&s;es his &s;urprize, 'to &s;ee the land &s;o well cultivated; &s;carce a &s;pot lay un|improved; the low grounds, divided by &s;mall ca|nals, were all &s;owed with rice; the higher ground planted with Indian corn, millet, and peas of diffe|rent &s;orts, beef and mutton very cheap, as well as all other nece&s;&s;aries of life.' The account this author gives of the di&s;po&s;ition of the natives, is, 'That they are generally good-natured and civil, and may be brought to any thing by fair and &s;oft means.' Ar|tus, &s;peaking of the &s;ame people, &s;ays, 'They are a &s;incere, inoffen&s;ive people, and do no inju&s;tice either to one another or &s;trangers.</Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e accounts, both of the good di&s;po&s;ition of the natives, and the fruitfulne&s;s of mo&s;t parts of Guinea, which are confirmed by many other authors, it may well be concluded, that their acquaintance with the Europeans would have been a happine&s;s to them, had tho&s;e la&s;t not only bore the name, but indeed been influenced by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity; but, alas! how hath the conduct of the Whites contradicted the precepts and example of Chri&s;t? In&s;tead of promote|ing the end of his coming, by preaching the go&s;pel of peace and good-will to man, they have, by their prac|tices,
<PB N="16" REF="010240_0015_0F7E08E5B6DF5D00">contributed to enflame every noxious pa&s;&s;ion of corrupt nature in the Negroes; they have incited them to make war one upon another, and for this purpo&s;e have furni&s;hed them with prodigious quantities of ammunition and arms, whereby they have been hurried into confu&s;ion, blood&s;hed, and all the extremities of temporal mi&s;ery, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily beget in their minds &s;uch a general dete&s;tation and &s;corn of the Chri&s;tian name, as may deeply affect, if not wholly preclude their belief of the great truths of our holy religion. Thus an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of gain hath become the principal and moving cau&s;e of the mo&s;t abominable and dreadful &s;cene, that was perhaps ever acted upon the face of the earth; even the power of their kings hath been made &s;ub&s;ervient to an&s;wer this wicked pur|po&s;e, in&s;tead of being protectors of their people, the&s;e rulers, allured by the tempting bait laid before them by the European Factors, &amp;c. have invaded the Liber|ties of their unhappy &s;ubjects, and are become their oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Divers accounts have already appeared in print de|clarative of the &s;hocking wickedne&s;s with which this Trade is carried on; the&s;e may not have fallen into the hands of &s;ome of my readers, I &s;hall, therefore, for their information, &s;elect a few of the mo&s;t remark|able in&s;tances that I have met with, &s;hewing the method by which the Trade is commonly managed all along the African coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Francis Moor, Factor to the African Company on the river Gambia, relates, <Q>That when the King of Bar&s;alli wants goods, &amp;c. he &s;ends a me&s;&s;enger to the Engli&s;h Governor at James' Fort, to de&s;ire he would &s;end up a &s;loop with a cargo of goods; which (&s;ays the author) the Governor never fails to do:
<PB N="17" REF="010240_0016_0F7E08E675106960">again&s;t the time the ve&s;&s;el arrives, the King plunders &s;ome of his enemies towns, &s;elling the people for &s;uch goods as he wants.&mdash;If he is not at war with any neighbouring King, he falls upon one of his own towns, and makes bold to &s;ell his own mi&s;e|rable &s;ubjects.</Q></P>
<P>N. Brue, in his account of the Trade, &amp;c. writes, <Q>That having received a quantity of goods, he wrote to the King of the country, That if he had a &s;ufficient number of &s;laves, he was ready to trade with him. This Prince (&s;ays that author) as well as other Ne|groe Monarchs, has always a &s;ure way of &s;upplying his deficiencies by &s;elling his own &s;ubjects.&mdash;The King had recour&s;e to this method, by &s;eizing three hundred of his own people, and &s;ent word to Brue, that he had the &s;laves ready to deliver for the goods.</Q></P>
<P>The mi&s;ery and blood&s;hed, con&s;equent of the Slave-Trade, is amply &s;et forth by the following extracts of two voyages to the Coa&s;t of Guinea for &s;laves. The fir&s;t in a ve&s;&s;el from Liverpool, taken verbatim from the original manu&s;cript of the Surgeon's journal, viz.</P>
<Q><P>Se&s;tro, December the 29th, 1724. No trade to-day, tho' many Traders come on board, they in|form us, that the people are gone to war within land, and will bring pri&s;oners enough in two or three days; in hopes of which we &s;tay.</P>
<P>The 30th. No trade yet, but our Traders came on board to-day, and informed us, the people had burnt four towns of their enemies, &s;o that to-morrow we expect &s;laves off. Another large &s;hip is come in: ye&s;terday came in a large Londoner.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t. Fair weather, but no trade yet; we &s;ee each night towns burning; but we hear the Se&s;tro men are many of them killed by the inland
<PB N="18" REF="010240_0017_0F7E08E73B955390">Negroes, &s;o that we fear this war will be un&s;ucce&s;s|ful.</P>
<P>The 2d January. La&s;t night we &s;aw a prodi|gious fire break out about eleven o'clock, and this morning &s;ee the town of Se&s;tro burnt down to the ground, (it contained &s;ome hundreds of hou&s;es) &s;o that we find their enemies are too hard for them at pre&s;ent, and con&s;equently our trade &s;poiled here; &s;o that about &s;even o'clock we weigh'd anchor, as did likewi&s;e the three other ve&s;&s;els to proceed lower down.</P></Q>
<P>The &s;econd relation, al&s;o taken from the original manu&s;cript journal of a per&s;on of credit, who went Surgeon on the &s;ame account, in a ve&s;&s;el from New-York to the Coa&s;t of Guinea, about eighteen years pa&s;t, is as follows, viz. <Q>Being on the coa&s;t at a place called Ba&s;alia, the Commander of the ve&s;&s;el, accord|ing to cu&s;tom, &s;ent a per&s;on on &s;hore with a pre&s;ent to the King, acquainting him with his arrival, and letting him know, they wanted a cargo of &s;laves. The King promi&s;ed to furni&s;h them with &s;laves, and in order to do it, &s;et out to go to war again&s;t his enemies, de&s;igning al&s;o to &s;urprize &s;ome town, and take all the people pri&s;oners: Sometime after, the King &s;ent them word, he had not yet met with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s, having been twice repul&s;ed, in attempting to break up two towns; but that he &s;till hoped to procure a number of &s;laves for them; and in this de&s;ign he per&s;i&s;ted till he met his enemies in the field, where a battle was fought, which la&s;ted three days, during which time the engagement was &s;o bloody, that four thou&s;and five hundred men were &s;lain on the &s;pot. The per&s;on, that wrote the account, beheld the bodies as they lay on the field
<PB N="19" REF="010240_0018_0F7E08E8000E5FB0">of battle. Think (&s;ays he in his journal) what a piti|able &s;ight it was, to &s;ee the widows weeping over their lo&s;t hu&s;bands, orphans deploring the lo&s;s of their fathers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who are acquainted with the Trade, agree, that many Negroes on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, who have been corrupted by their intercour&s;e and conver&s;e with the European Factors, have learnt to &s;tick at no act of cruelty for gain. The&s;e make it a practice to &s;teal abundance of little Blacks of both &s;exes, when found on the roads or in the fields, where their parents keep them all day to watch the corn, &amp;c. Some authors &s;ay, the Negroe Factors go &s;ix or &s;even hundred miles up the country with goods, bought from the Euro|peans, where markets of men are kept in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of bea&s;ts with us; when the poor &s;laves, whether brought from far or near, come to the &s;ea-&s;hore, they are &s;tripped naked, and &s;trictly exa|mined by the European Surgeons, both men and wo|men, without the lea&s;t di&s;tinction or mode&s;ty; tho&s;e which are approved as good, are marked with a red|hot iron with the &s;hip's mark, after which they are put on board the ve&s;&s;els, the men being &s;hackled with irons two and two together. Reader bring the matter home, and con&s;ider whether any &s;ituation in life can be more completely mi&s;erable than that of tho&s;e di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed captives. When we reflect, that each indivi|dual of this number had &s;ome tender attachment which was broken by this cruel &s;eparation; &s;ome pa|rent or wife, who had not an opportunity of mingling tears in a parting embrace: perhaps &s;ome infant or aged parent whom his labour was to feed and vigi|lance protect; them&s;elves under the dreadful appre|hen&s;ion of an unknown perpetual &s;lavery; pent up
<PB N="20" REF="010240_0019_0F7E08E8CE31E170">within the narrow confines of a ve&s;&s;el, &s;ometimes &s;ix or &s;even hundred together, where they lie as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible. Under the&s;e complicated di&s;tre&s;&s;es they are often reduced to a &s;tate of de&s;peration, wherein many have leaped into the &s;ea, and have kept them&s;elves un|der water, till they were drowned; others have &s;tarved them&s;elves to death, for the prevention whereof &s;ome ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els have cut off the legs and arms of a number of tho&s;e poor de&s;perate creatures, to terrify the re&s;t. Great numbers have al&s;o frequently been killed, and &s;ome deliberately put to death under the greare&s;t torture, when they have attempted to ri&s;e, in order to free them&s;elves from their pre&s;ent mi&s;ery, and the &s;lavery de&s;igned them. An in&s;tance of the la&s;t kind appears particularly in an account given by the ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el, who brought a cargo of &s;laves to Barbadoz; indeed it appears &s;o irreconcileable to the common dictates of humanity, that one would doubt the truth of it, had it not been related by a &s;erious per&s;on of undoubted credit, who had it from the cap|tain's own mouth. Upon an inquiry, What had been the &s;ucce&s;s of his voyage? He an&s;wered, <Q>That he had found it a difficult matter to &s;et the Negroes a fighting with each other, in order to procure the number he wanted; but that when he had obtained this end, and had got his ve&s;&s;el filled with &s;laves, a new dif|ficulty aro&s;e from their refu&s;al to take food; tho&s;e de&s;perate creatures chu&s;ing rather to die with hun|ger, than to be carried from their native country.</Q> Upon a farther inquiry, by what means he had pre|vailed upon them to forego this de&s;perate re&s;olution, he an&s;wered, <Q>That he obliged all the Negroes to come upon deck, where they per&s;i&s;ting in their re|&s;olution of not taking food, he cau&s;ed his &s;ailors to
<PB N="21" REF="010240_0020_0F7E08E9753F68A0">lay hold upon one of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, and chopt the poor creature into &s;mall pieces, forcing &s;ome of the others to eat a part of the mangled body; with|al &s;wearing to the &s;urvivors, that he would u&s;e them all, one after the other, in the &s;ame manner, if they did not con&s;ent to eat.</Q> This horrid execution he applauded as a good act, it having had the de&s;ired ef|fect, in bringing them to take food.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar ca&s;e is mentioned in A&s;tley's Collection of Voyages, by John Atkins, Surgeon on board Ad|miral Ogle's &s;quadron, <Q>Of one Harding, ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el, in which &s;everal of the men-&s;laves, and a woman-&s;lave, had attempted to ri&s;e, in order to re|cover their liberty; &s;ome of whom the ma&s;ter, of his own authority, &s;entenced to cruel death; making them fir&s;t eat the heart and liver of one of tho&s;e he killed. The woman he hoi&s;ted by the thumbs; whipped and &s;la&s;hed with knives before the other &s;laves, till &s;he died.</Q></P>
<P>As dete&s;table and &s;hocking as this may appear to &s;uch, who&s;e hearts are not yet hardened by the prac|tice of that cruelty, which the love of wealth, by de|grees, introduceth into the human mind; it will not be &s;trange to tho&s;e who have been concerned or employ|ed in the Trade. Now here ari&s;es a nece&s;&s;ary query to tho&s;e who hold the ballance and &s;word of ju&s;tice; and who mu&s;t account to God for the u&s;e they have made of it. Since <HI>our Engli&s;h law is &s;o truly valuable for its ju&s;tice,</HI> how can they overlook the&s;e barbarous deaths of the unhappy Africans without trial, or due proof of their being guilty, of crimes adequate to their pu|ni&s;hment? Why are tho&s;e ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els (who are often not the mo&s;t tender and con&s;iderate of men) thus &s;uffered to be the &s;overeign arbiters of the lives
<PB N="22" REF="010240_0021_0F7E08EA88F601A0">of the mi&s;erable Negroes; and allowed, with impuni|ty, thus to de&s;troy, may I not &s;ay, murder their fellow|creatures, and that by means &s;o cruel as cannot be even related but with &s;hame and horror.</P>
<P>When the ve&s;&s;els arrive at their de&s;tined port in the Colonies, the poor Negroes are to be di&s;po&s;ed of to the planters, and here they are again expo&s;ed naked, without any di&s;tinction of &s;exes, to the brutal exami|nation of their purcha&s;ers; and this, it may well be judg|ed is to many of them another occa&s;ion of deep di&s;tre&s;s, e&s;pecially to the females: Add to this, that near con|nections mu&s;t now again be &s;eparated, to go with their &s;everal purcha&s;ers: In this melancholy &s;cene mothers are &s;een hanging over their daughters, bedewing their naked brea&s;ts with tears, and daughters clinging to their parents; not knowing what new &s;tage of di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t follow their &s;eparation; or if ever they &s;hall meet again; and here what &s;ympathy, what commi&s;e|ration are they to expect; why indeed, if they will not &s;eparate as readily as their owners think proper, the whipper is called for, and the la&s;h exerci&s;ed upon their naked bodies, till obliged to part.</P>
<P>Can any human heart, that retains a fellow-feeling for the &s;ufferings of mankind, be unconcerned at re|lations of &s;uch grievous affliction, to which this op|pre&s;&s;ed part of our &s;pecies are &s;ubjected: God gave to man dominion over the fi&s;h of the &s;ea, and over the fowls of the air, and over the cattle, &amp;c. but im|po&s;ed no involuntary &s;ubjection of one man to another.</P>
<P>The truth of this po&s;ition, has of late been clearly &s;et forth by per&s;ons of reputation and ability, particularly George Wallis, in his Sy&s;tem of the Laws of Scotland, who&s;e &s;entiments are &s;o worthy the notice of all con|&s;iderate per&s;ons, that I &s;hall here repeat a part of what
<PB N="23" REF="010240_0022_0F7E08EB633D0AB8">he has not long &s;ince publi&s;hed, concerning the Afri|can Trade, viz. <Q>If this trade admits of a moral or a rational ju&s;tification, every crime, even the mo&s;t atrocious, may be ju&s;tified: Government was in&s;ti|tuted for the good of mankind. Kings, Princes, Go|vernors are not proprietors of tho&s;e who are &s;ub|jected to their authority, they have not a right to make them mi&s;erable. On the contrary, their au|thority is ve&s;ted in them, that they may by the ju&s;t exerci&s;e of it, promote the happine&s;s of their peo|ple: Of cour&s;e, they have not a right to di&s;po&s;e of their Liberty, and to &s;ell them for &s;laves: Be&s;ides, no man has a right to acquire or to purcha&s;e them; men and their Liberty are not either &s;aleable or purcha&s;able, one therefore has no body but him&s;elf to blame, in ca&s;e he &s;hall find him&s;elf deprived of a man, whom he thought he had, by buying for a price, made his own; for he dealt in a trade which was illicit, and was prohibited by the mo&s;t obvious dictates of humanity. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, every one of tho&s;e unfortunate men, who are pretended to be &s;laves, has a right to be declared to be free, for he never lo&s;t his Liberty, he could not lo&s;e it; his Prince had no power to di&s;po&s;e of him: of cour&s;e the &s;ale was void. This right he carries about with him, and is entitled every where to get it declared. As &s;oon, therefore, as he comes into a country, in which the judges are not forgetful of their own hu|manity, it is their duty to remember that he is a man, and to declare him to be free.&mdash;This is the law of nature, which is obligatory on all men, at all times, and in all places.&mdash;Would not any of us, who &s;hould be &s;natched by pirates from his native land, think him&s;elf cruelly abu&s;ed, and at all times in|titled
<PB N="24" REF="010240_0023_0F7E08EBCE026530">to be free? Have not the&s;e unfortunate Afri|cans, who meet with the &s;ame cruel fate, the &s;ame right? Are not they men as well as we, and have they not the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility? Let us not, therefore, defend or &s;upport a u&s;age, which is contrary to all the laws of humanity?</Q></P>
<P>Francis Hutchi&s;on, al&s;o in his Sy&s;tem of Moral Philo&s;ophy, &s;peaking on the &s;ubject of Slavery, &s;ays, <Q>He who detains another by force in &s;lavery, is al|ways bound to prove his title. The &s;lave &s;old or carried away into a di&s;tant country, mu&s;t not be obliged to prove a negative, That he never forfeited his Liberty. The violent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or mu&s;t, in all ca|&s;es, &s;hew his title, e&s;pecially where the old proprie|tor is well known. In this ca&s;e each man is the ori|ginal proprietor of his own Liberty: The proof of his lo&s;ing it mu&s;t be incumbent on tho&s;e, who de|prived him of it by force. Strange, (&s;ays the &s;ame author) that in any nation, where a &s;en&s;e of Liberty prevails, where the Chri&s;tian religion is profe&s;&s;ed, cu&s;tom and high pro&s;pect of gain can &s;o &s;tupify the con&s;ciences of men, and all &s;en&s;e of natural ju&s;tice, that they can hear &s;uch computation made about the value of their fellow-men and their liberty, with|out out abhorence and indignation?</Q></P>
<P>The noted Baron Monte&s;quieu gives it, as his opi|nion, in his <HI>Spirit of Law,</HI> page 348, <Q>That nothing more a&s;&s;imilates a man to a bea&s;t than living among&s;t freemen, him&s;elf a &s;lave, &s;uch people as the&s;e are the natural enemies of &s;ociety, and their number mu&s;t always be dangerous.</Q></P>
<P>The author of a pamphlet, lately printed in Lon|don, entituled, <HI>An E&s;&s;ay in Vindication of the Conti|nental Colonies of America,</HI> writes, <Q>That the bondage
<PB N="25" REF="010240_0024_0F7E08EC73D276D8">we have impo&s;ed on the Africans, is ab&s;olutely re|pugnant to ju&s;tice. That it is highly incon&s;i&s;tent with civil policy: Fir&s;t, as it tends to &s;uppre&s;s all im|provements in arts and &s;ciences; without which it is morally impo&s;&s;ible that any nation &s;hould be happy or powerful. Secondly, as it may deprave the minds of the freemen; &s;teeling their hearts again&s;t the laudable feelings of virtue and humanity. And, la&s;tly, as it endangers the community by the de|&s;tructive effects of civil commotions, need I add to the&s;e, (&s;ays that author) what every heart, which is not callous to all tender feelings, will readily &s;ug|ge&s;t; that it is &s;hocking to humanity, violative of every generous &s;entiment, abhorrent utterly from the Chri&s;tian religion; for as Monte&s;quieu very ju&s;t|ly ob&s;erves, <HI>We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e them not to be men, or a &s;u&s;picion would follow that we our&s;elves are not Chri&s;tians.</HI> &mdash; There cannot be a more dangerous maxim, than that nece&s;&s;ity is a plea for inju&s;tice. For who &s;hall &s;ix the degree of this nece&s;&s;ity? What villain &s;o atrocious, who may not urge this excu&s;e; or, as Milton has happly expre&s;&s;ed it,
<L><HI>&mdash; And with nece&s;&s;ity</HI></L>
<L><HI>The tyrant's plea, excu&s;e his dev'li&s;h deed?</HI></L> That our Colonies want people, is a very weak argu|ment for &s;o inhuman a violation of ju&s;tice. &mdash; Shall a civilized, a Chri&s;tian nation encourage &s;lavery; be|cau&s;e the barbarous, &s;avage, lawle&s;s African hath done it? Mon&s;trous thought! To what end do we profe&s;s a religion who&s;e dictates we &s;o flagrantly vio|late? Wherefore have we that pattern of goodne&s;s and humanity, if we refu&s;e to follow it? How long &s;hall we continue a practice, which policy rejects, ju&s;tice condemns, and piety di&s;&s;uades? Shall the

If the barbarous Africans &s;hall continue to en&s;lave each other let the daemon &s;lave|ry remain among them, that their crime may in|clude its own puni&s;hment.

<P>James Fo&s;ter, in <HI>his Di&s;cour&s;es on Natural Religion and Social Virtue,</HI> al&s;o &s;hews his ju&s;t indignation at this wicked practice, which he declares to be <HI>a criminal and outrageous violation of the natural right of mankind.</HI> At page 156, 2 vol. he &s;ays, <Q>Should we have read concerning the Greeks or Romans of old, that they traded, with view to make &s;laves of their own &s;pe|cies, whom they certainly knew that this would in|volve in &s;chemes of blood and murder, of de&s;troying or en&s;laving each other, that they even fomented wars, and engaged whole nations and tribes in open ho&s;ti|lities, for their own private advantage; that they had no dete&s;tation of the violence and cruelty; but only feared the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their inhuman enter|pri&s;es; that they carried men like them&s;elves, their brethren, and the off-&s;pring of the &s;ame common parent, to be &s;old like bea&s;ts of prey, or bea&s;ts of burden, and put them to the &s;ame reproachful trial, of their &s;oundne&s;s, &s;trength and capacity for greater bodily &s;ervice; that quite forgetting and renounce|ing the original dignity of human nature, commu|nicated to all, they treated them with more &s;everi|ty and ruder di&s;cipline, than even the ox or the a&s;s, who are void of under&s;tanding,&mdash;&s;hould we not, if this had been the ca&s;e, have naturally been led to
<PB N="27" REF="010240_0026_0F7E08F10FE61568">de&s;pi&s;e all their <HI>pretended refinements of morality;</HI> and to have concluded, that as they were not nations de&s;titute of politene&s;s, they mu&s;t have been <HI>entire &s;trangers to virtue and benevolence.</HI>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding this, we our&s;elves (who pro|fe&s;s to be Chri&s;tians, and boa&s;t of the peculiar ad|vantage we enjoy, by means of an expre&s;s revelation of our duty from heaven) are in effect, the&s;e very untaught and rude heathen countries. With all our &s;uperior light, we in&s;til into tho&s;e, whom we call &s;avage and barbarous, the mo&s;t de&s;picable opinion of human nature. We, to the utmo&s;t of our power, weaken and di&s;&s;olve the univer&s;al tie, that binds and unites mankind. We practice what we &s;hould exclaim again&s;t, as the utmo&s;t exce&s;s of cruelty and tyranny, if nations of the world, differing in colour, and form of government from our&s;elves, were &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of empire, as to be able to reduce us to a &s;tate of unmerited and bruti&s;h &s;ervitude. Of con&s;e|quence, we &s;acrifice our rea&s;on, our humanity, our Chri&s;tianity, to an unnatural &s;ordid gain. We teach other nations to de&s;pi&s;e and trample under foot, all the obligations of &s;ocial virtue. We take the mo&s;t effectual method to prevent the propagation of the go&s;pel by repre&s;enting it as a &s;cheme of power and barbarous oppre&s;&s;ion, and an enemy to the natural privileges and rights of men.</P>
<P>Perhaps all, that I have now offered, may be of very little weight to re&s;train this enormity, this ag|gravated iniquity. However, I &s;hall &s;till have the &s;a|tistaction, of having entered my private prote&s;t again&s;t a practice which, in my opinion, bids that God, who is the God and Father of the gentiles, un|converted to Chri&s;tianity, mo&s;t daring and bold
<PB N="28" REF="010240_0027_0F7E08F219BB1CC8">defiance, and &s;purns at all the principles, both of na|tural and revealed religion?</P></Q></P>
<P>How the Briti&s;h nation fir&s;t came to be concerned in a practice, by which the rights and liberties of man|kind are &s;o violently infringed, and which is &s;o oppo|&s;ite to the apprehen&s;ions Engli&s;hmen have always had of what natural ju&s;tice requires, is indeed &s;urpri&s;ing. It was about the year 1563, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, that the Engli&s;h fir&s;t engaged in the Gui|nea Trade; when it appears, from an account in Hill's Naval Hi&s;tory, page 293, That when Captain Haw|kins returned from his fir&s;t voyage to Africa, that ge|nerous &s;pirited Prince&s;s, attentive to the intere&s;t of her &s;ubjects, &s;ent for the Commander, to whom &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her concern le&s;t any of the African Negroes &s;hould be carried off without their free con&s;ent, <HI>decla|ring it would be dete&s;table, and call down the vengeance of heaven upon the undertakers.</HI> Captain Hawkins pro|mi&s;ed to comply with the Queen's injunction: never|thele&s;s, we find in the account, given in the &s;ame Hi&s;tory, of Hawkins' &s;econd voyage, the author u&s;ing the&s;e remarkable words, <HI>Here began the horrid practice of forcing the Africans into &s;lavery.</HI></P>
<P>Labut, a Roman Mi&s;&s;ionary, in his account of the I&s;les of America, at page 114, of the 4th vol. mentions, that Lewis the 13th, father to the pre&s;ent French King's grand-father, was extremely unea&s;y at a law by which all the Negroes of his Colonies were to be made &s;laves; but it being &s;trongly urged to him, as the readie&s;t means for their conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity, he acquie&s;ced therewith.</P>
<P>And altho' we have not many accounts of the im|pre&s;&s;ions which this piratical inva&s;ion of the rights of mankind, gave to &s;erious minded people, when fir&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="010240_0028_0F7E08F27A87DB30">engaged in; yet it did not e&s;cape the notice of &s;ome, who might be e&s;teemed in a peculiar manner as watch|men in their day to the different &s;ocieties of Chri&s;|tians, whereunto they belonged. Richard Baxter, an eminent preacher among&s;t the Nonconformi&s;ts, in the la&s;t century, well known and particularly e&s;teemed by mo&s;t of the &s;erious Pre&s;byterians and Independents, in his Chri&s;tian Directory mo&s;tly, wrote about an hundred years ago, fully &s;hews his dete&s;tation of this practice in the following words, <Q>Do you not mark how God hath followed you with plagues, and may not con&s;cience tell you, that it is for your inhuma|nity to the &s;ouls and bodies of men.&mdash;To go as pirates and catch up poor Negroes, or people of an|other land that never forfeited life or liberty, and to make them &s;laves, and &s;ell them, is one of the wor&s;t kind of thievery in the world, and &s;uch per&s;ons are to be taken for the common enemies of mankind; and they that buy them, and u&s;e them as bea&s;ts, for their meer commodity, and betray, or de&s;troy, or neglect their &s;ouls, are fitter to be called devils than Chri&s;tians. It is an heinous &s;in to buy them, unle&s;s it be in charity to deliver them.&mdash;Undoubtedly they are pre&s;ently bound to deliver them; becau&s;e by right the man is his own; therefore no man el&s;e can have a ju&s;t title to him.</Q></P>
<P>We al&s;o find George Fox, a man of exemplary piety, who was the principal in&s;trument in gathering the religious &s;ociety of people, called Quakers, ex|pre&s;&s;ing his concernand fellow-feeling for the bondage of the Negroes: In a di&s;cour&s;e taken from his mouth, in Barbados, in the year 1671, &s;ays, <Q>Con&s;ider with your|&s;elves, if you were in the &s;ame condition as the Blacks are,&mdash;who came &s;trangers to you, and were &s;old to you
<PB N="30" REF="010240_0029_0F7E08F34A806290">as &s;laves. I &s;ay, if this &s;hould be the condition of you or yours, you would think it hard mea&s;ure. Yea, and very great bondage and cruelty. And, there|fore, con&s;ider &s;eriously of this, and do you for and to them, as you would willingly have them, or any other, to do unto you, were you in the like &s;lavi&s;h condition; and bring them to know the Lord Chri&s;t.</Q> And in his journal, page 431, &s;peaking of the advice he gave his friends at Barbados, he &s;ays, <Q>I de&s;ired al&s;o, that they would cau&s;e their over&s;eers to deal mildly and gently with their Negroes, and not to u&s;e cruelty towards them, as the manner of &s;ome had been, and that after certain years of &s;ervitude they &s;hould make them free.</Q></P>
<P>In a book printed in Liverpool, called <HI>The Liver|pool Memorandum-book,</HI> which contains, among other things, an account of the trade of that port, there is an exact li&s;t of the ve&s;&s;els employed in the Guinea trade, and of the number of Slaves imported in each ve&s;&s;el, by which it appears, that in the year 1753, the number imported to America, by ve&s;&s;els belonging to that port, amounted to upwards of thirty thou&s;and; and from the number of ve&s;&s;els employed by the Afri|can Company in London and Bri&s;tol; we may, with &s;ome degree of certainty, conclude, there is, at lea&s;t, One Hundred Thou&s;and Negoes purcha&s;ed and brought on board our &s;hips yearly from the coa&s;t of Africa, on their account. This is confirmed in An|der&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Trade and Commerce, printed the year before la&s;t, where it is &s;aid, at page 68 of the Appendix, <Q><HI>That England &s;upplies her American Co|lonies with Negro-&s;laves, amounting in number to above One Hundred Thou&s;and every year.</HI></Q> When the ve&s;&s;els are full freighted with &s;laves, they &s;et out for
<PB N="31" REF="010240_0030_0F7E08F3F3D36CF0">our plantations in America, and may be two orthree months on the voyage, during which time, from the filth and &s;tench that is among them, di&s;tempers fre|quently break out, which carry off a great many, a fifth, a fourth, yea &s;ometimes a third of them; &s;o that taking all the &s;laves together that are brought on board our &s;hips yearly, one may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and of them die on the voyage. And in a printed account of the State of the Negroes in our plantations, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that a fourth part, more or le&s;s, die at the different I&s;lands, in what is called the &s;ea&s;oning. Hence it may be pre&s;umed, that, at a mo|derate computation of the &s;laves, who are purcha&s;ed by our African merchants in a year, near thirty thou|&s;ands die upon the voyage and in the &s;ea&s;oning. Add to this, the prodigious number who are killed in the incur&s;ions and inte&s;tine wars, by which the Negroes procure the number of &s;laves wanted to load the ve&s;|&s;els: How dreadful then is this Slave-Trade, whereby &s;o many thou&s;ands of our fellow-creatures, free by nature, endued with the &s;ame rational faculties, and called to be heirs of the &s;ame &s;alvation with us, lo&s;e their lives, and are truly, and properly &s;peaking, mur|dered every year. For it is not nece&s;&s;ary, in order to convict a man of murder, to make it appear, that he had an intention to commit murder. Whoever does, by unju&s;t force or violence, deprive another of his Li|berty; and, while he has him in his power, reduces him, by cruel treatment, to &s;uch a condition as evidently en|dangers his life; and the event occa&s;ions his death, is actually guilty of murder. It is no le&s;s &s;hocking to read the accounts given by Sir Hans Sloan, and others, of the inhuman and unmerciful treatment tho&s;e Blacks meet with, who &s;urvive the &s;ea&s;oning in the I&s;tands,
<PB N="32" REF="010240_0031_0F7E08F4C2F7BC30">often for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, to which the puni&s;hment they receive bears no proportion. <Q>And the horrid execu|tions, which are frequently made there upon di&s;co|very of the plots laid by the blacks, for the recovery of their liberty; of &s;ome they break the bones, whil&s;t alive, on a wheel; others they burn or rather roa&s;t to death; others they &s;tarve to death, with a loaf hanging before their mouths.</Q> Thus they are brought to expire, with frightful agonies, in the mo&s;t horrid tortures. For negligence only they are unmercifully whipped, till their backs are raw, and than pepper and &s;alt is &s;cattered on the wounds to heighten the pain and prevent mortification. Is it not a cau&s;e of much &s;orrow and lamentation, that &s;o many poor creatures &s;hould be thus rack'd with excruciating tortures, for crimes which often their tormentors have occa&s;ioned: Mu&s;t not even the common feelings of human nature have &s;uffered &s;ome grievous change in tho&s;e men, to be capable of &s;uch horrid cruelty, towards their fel|low men? If they de&s;erve death, ought not their judges, in the death decreed them, always to remem|ber that the&s;e their haple&s;s fellow-creatures are men, and them&s;elves profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians. The Mo&s;aic law teaches us our duty in the&s;e ca&s;es, in the merciful pro|vi&s;ion it made in the puni&s;hment of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, Deuter. xxv. 2. <HI>And it &s;hall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge &s;hall cau&s;e him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number, Forty &s;tripes he may give him and not exceed.</HI> And the rea&s;on rendered is out of re|&s;pect to human nature, viz. <HI>Le&s;t if he &s;hould exceed, and beat him above the&s;e, with many &s;tripes, then thy brother &s;hould &s;eem vile unto thee.</HI> Britons boa&s;t them|&s;elves to be a generous, humane people, who have a true
<PB N="33" REF="010240_0032_0F7E08F577A61BE8">&s;en&s;e of the importance of Liberty; but is this a true character, whil&s;t that barbarous, &s;avage Slave-Trade, with all its attendant horrors, receives countenance and protection from the Legi&s;lature, whereby &s;o ma|ny thou&s;and lives are yearly &s;acrificed. Do we indeed believe the truths declared in the go&s;pel? Are we per|&s;uaded that the threatnings, as well as the promi&s;es therein contained, will have their accompli&s;hment? If indeed we do, mu&s;t we not tremble to think what a load of guilt lies upon our Nation generally and individu|ally, &s;o far as we in any degree abet or countenance this aggravated iniquity.</P>
<P>We have a memorable in&s;tance in hi&s;tory, which may be fruitful of in&s;truction, if timely and properly applied; it is a quotation made by Sir John Temple, in his hi&s;tory of the Iri&s;h rebellion, being an ob&s;er|vation out of Giraldus Cambren&s;is, a noted author, who lived about &s;ix hundred years ago, concerning the cau&s;es of the pro&s;perity of the Engli&s;h undertake|ings in Ireland, when they conquered that I&s;land, he &s;aith, <Q>That a &s;ynod, or council of the Clergy, being then a&s;&s;embled at Armagh, and that point fully de|bated, it was unanimously agreed, that the &s;ins of the people were the occa&s;ion of that heavy judgment then fallen upon their nation; and that e&s;pecially their buying of Engli&s;hmen from merchants and pi|rates, and detaining them under a mo&s;t mi&s;erable hard bondage, had cau&s;ed the Lord, by way of ju&s;t retaliation, to leave them to be reduced, by the Engli&s;h, to the &s;ame &s;tate of &s;lavery. Whereupon they made a public act in that council, that all the Engli&s;h, held in captivity throughout the whole land, &s;hould be pre&s;ently re&s;tored to their former Liberty.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="010240_0033_0F7E08F7243030D0">
I &s;hall now conclude with an extract from an ad|dre&s;s of a late author to the merchants, and others, who are concerned in carrying on the Guinea Trade: Which al&s;o, in a great mea&s;ure, is applicable to others, who, for the love of gain, are in any way concerned in promoting or maintaining the captivity of the Ne|groes.</P>
<Q><P>As the bu&s;ine&s;s, you are publicly carrying on before the world, has a bad a&s;pect, and you are &s;en|&s;ible mo&s;t men make objection again&s;t it, you ought to ju&s;tify it to the world, upon principles of rea&s;on, equity and humanity; to make it appear, that it is no unju&s;t inva&s;ion of the per&s;ons, or encroachments on the rights of men; or for ever to lay it a&s;ide.&mdash; But laving a&s;ide the re&s;entment of men, which is but of little or no moment in compari&s;on with that of the Almighty, think of a future reckoning: con|&s;ider how you &s;hall come off in the great and awful day of accompt: You now heap up riches and live in plea&s;ure; but, oh! what will you do in the end thereof? and that is not far off: what, if death &s;hould &s;eize upon you, and hurry you out of this world, un|der all that load of blood-guiltine&s;s, that now lies upon your &s;ouls? The go&s;pel expre&s;sly declares, that thieves and murderers &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God. Con&s;ider, that at the &s;ame time, and by the &s;ame means, you now trea&s;ure up worldly riches, you are trea&s;uring up to your&s;elves wrath, again&s;t the day of wrath, and vengeance that &s;hall come upon the workers of iniquity, unle&s;s prevented by a timely repentance.</P>
<P>And what greater iniquity, what crime that is more heinous, that carries in it more complicated guilt, can you name than that, in the habitual, de|liberate
<PB N="35" REF="010240_0034_0F7E08F7B41FEEE0">practice of which you now live? How can you lift up your guilty eyes to heaven? How can you pray for mercy to him that made you, or hope for any favour from him that formed you, while you go on thus gro&s;sly and openly to di&s;honour him, in deba&s;ing and de&s;troying the noble&s;t workman&s;hip of his hands in this lower world? He is the father of men; and do you think he will not re&s;ent &s;uch treatment of his offspring, whom he hath &s;o loved, as to give his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever be|lieveth in him, might not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life? This love of God to man, revealed in the go&s;pel, is a great aggravation of your guilt; for if God &s;o loved us, we ought al&s;o to love one another. You remember the fate of the &s;ervant, who took hold of his fellow-&s;ervant, who was in his debt, by the throat, and ca&s;t him into pri&s;on: Think then, and tremble to think, what will be your fate, who take your fellow-&s;ervants by the throat, that owe you not a penny, and make them pri&s;oners for life.</P>
<P>Give your&s;elves leave to reflect impartially upon, and con&s;ider the nature of, this Man-Trade, which, if you do, your hearts mu&s;t needs relent, if you have not lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of humanity, all pity and compa&s;|&s;ion towards tho&s;e of your own kind, to think what calamities, what havock and de&s;truction among them, you have been the authors of, for filthy lucre's &s;ake. God grant you may be &s;en&s;ible of your guilt, and repent in time.</P></Q>
