<Q><BIBL><HI>Exodus 31.12, 13.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And the Lord &s;pake unto Mo&s;es, &s;aying, Speak thou al&s;o unto the Children of I&s;rael, &s;aying,</P>
<P>Verily my Sabbaths ye &s;hall keep; for it is a &s;ign between me and you thro' out your Gene|rations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth &s;anctify you.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN the&s;e words the great Law of the <HI>Sabbath</HI> is repeated to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and by him unto the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> with an awful <HI>preface</HI> and a mo&s;t pow|erful <HI>rea&s;on</HI> annexed. The <HI>preface</HI> is much the &s;ame with that from Heaven, and <HI>Sinai,</HI> before the ten Commandments; <HI>And God &s;pake all the&s;e Words &s;aying, I am the Lord thy God.</HI> Let us reverently attend and an&s;wer, <HI>I will hear what God the Lord will &s;peak.</HI></P>
<P>THE Commandment is here given in the mo&s;t augu&s;t, authoritative and peremptory man|ner:
<PB N="2" REF="002620_0007_0FDB14D0E72919C8"><HI>Verily my Sabbaths ye &s;hall keep.</HI> More Au|thority and Commandment can't well be put in|to fewer words.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, HERE is a &s;pecial and mo&s;t weighty <HI>rea&s;on</HI> annexed, to inforce the precept: <HI>for it is a &s;ign,</HI> &amp;c. It is great conde&s;cention and grace in God to us, to annex a rea&s;on to any of his Commands. His &s;overeign Will is the highe&s;t rea&s;on. But there is much of Maje&s;ty and much Grace in this rea&s;on: <HI>It is a &s;ign between me and you:</HI> And will God in very deed give us &s;uch a &s;ign and token between Him&s;elf and us? will he in very deed deal &s;o with man upon earth? And give a <HI>&s;tanding</HI> &s;ign too <HI>thro' out all the Gene|rations</HI> of man on earth? O the favour and grace to du&s;t, while he humbles him&s;elf to be|hold the things that are above!</P>
<P>BUT what is the Lord's Sabbath a &s;ign <HI>of</HI> thro' all our Generations? Why it &s;ignifies and lets us know 1. that he is <HI>the Lord:</HI> Lord of the world, Lord of our time, Lord of our lives; the great Proprietor and ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;er of them. And 2. that he is the Lord <HI>our Sanctifier:</HI> that I am the Lord <HI>that doth &s;anctify you.</HI></P>
<P>BUT <HI>how</HI> the Sabbath is a <HI>&s;ign</HI> of <HI>this,</HI> and why this is a <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for our keeping and &s;ancti|fying the Sabbath, is to be &s;aid under the <HI>Doc|trines,</HI> which are the&s;e two:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Great GOD vehemently requires of us the Sanctifica|tion of his Sabbath.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it is a &s;ign between Him and us that He is the Lord our Sanctifier.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. D. <HI>THE Lord our God has mo&s;t &s;trictly and vehemently required the Ob&s;ervation and keeping
<PB N="3" REF="002620_0008_0FDB14D279253238">Sabbath. Verily my Sabbaths ye &s;hall keep.</HI> Words can't be &s;tricter than the&s;e are. And in this manner the precept is always given: <HI>Ye &s;hall keep my Sabbaths, I am the Lord.</HI> Lev. 19.30 &mdash; I &s;hall only ob&s;erve to you how &s;trictly and vehe|mently this law of the Sabbath is in&s;i&s;ted on <HI>thro' the whole Bible.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. IT was a Law to man <HI>from the beginning of the world,</HI> and the <HI>fir&s;t Law</HI> (and &s;econd Ble&s;&s;ing) that was given to man, even in <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> in his &s;tate of <HI>innocence.</HI> For if man had never &s;inned, yet there would for ever have remained to him the keeping of a Sabbath, every &s;eventh day: As you read, Gen. 2.1, 2, 3. <HI>Thus the heavens and the earth were fini&s;hed and all the ho&s;t of them, ond on the &s;eventh day God ended his Work which he had made, and he re&s;ted on the &s;eventh day from all his work which he had made; and God ble&s;&s;ed the &s;eventh day and &s;anctified it, becau&s;e that in it he had re&s;ted from all his work which he had created and made.</HI> So from the <HI>Creation</HI> of the world God in|&s;tituted a weekly Sabbath, for the perpetual &s;o|lemn prai&s;es of the <HI>Creator</HI> from the Sons of men. He &s;anctified the <HI>Day,</HI> <Q>to be the &s;pecial Time of <HI>their</HI> ble&s;&s;ing Him and <HI>his</HI> ble&s;&s;ing them.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bp. <HI>Patrick.</HI></NOTE> The &s;eventh day was ordained <HI>a Univer&s;al and Everla&s;ting holy Fe&s;tival</HI> from the Day wherein Man was created. This magnifies the Sabbath and makes it honourable, and &s;acred for ever to us, that it was the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of God's Laws to man. Thus we keep <Q>the <HI>Earths birth-day</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Edwards.</HI></NOTE>: It is a &s;acred
<PB N="4" REF="002620_0009_0FDB14D41780B170">Fe&s;tival in memory of the <HI>Worlds nativity.</HI></Q> And it leaves us no room to que&s;tion <HI>Adam</HI>'s keep|ing the Sabbath day.</P>
<P>THIS &s;olemn and <HI>early</HI> Injunction of a Sab|bath to man is a Circum&s;tance that puts great honour and dignity upon the <HI>Sabbath-day.</HI> It was ordained for the &s;pecial honour and perpe|tual wor&s;hip of the Lord our Maker, immediatly upon the Creation of our <HI>fir&s;t Parents,</HI> and in their paradi&s;aic &s;tate.</P>
<P>WE read of <HI>Noah,</HI> Gen. 8.10, 12. that <HI>he &s;taid yet other &s;even days, and again he &s;ent forth the Dove out of the Ark.</HI> It appears by this, &s;ays Bp. <HI>Patrick,</HI> that on the &s;eventh day <HI>Noah</HI> expected a Ble&s;&s;ing rather than on another day; it being the day devoted from the Beginning to religious &s;ervices.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE &s;anctification of the Sabbath was <HI>one of the fir&s;t things given in Commandment to I&s;rael upon their leaving Egypt.</HI> God was now gather|ing and forming to him&s;elf a <HI>Church</HI> in the earth, and it was fitting and nece&s;&s;ary to remember them of his <HI>Sabbath</HI> upon their &s;etting out to|ward <HI>Canaan,</HI> the Type of the everla&s;ting <HI>Sabba|ti&s;m.</HI> They had it may be almo&s;t <HI>lo&s;t</HI> the Re|membrance of his Sabbaths in <HI>Egypt,</HI> at lea&s;t many of them; but <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is directed by God to mind them of it, and that not as a novel but an <HI>ancient</HI> thing. See <HI>Exod.</HI> 16. It was upon the fir&s;t provi&s;ion of <HI>Manna</HI> for the Camp of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> In the 4 <HI>and</HI> 5 <HI>ver&s;es</HI> of that <HI>Chapter,</HI> the Lord &s;aid to <HI>Mo&s;es, Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you, and the people &s;hall gather a certain rate e|very day; but on the &s;ixth day they &s;hall prepare twice
<PB N="5" REF="002620_0010_0FDB14D5B293C4E8">as much as on the other days:</HI> Accordingly, as we read on from the 22 <HI>ver&s;e</HI> of that <HI>Chapter, on the &s;ixth day the people gathered twice as much bread, two Omers for one man; and the Rulers came and told Mo&s;es: Then he &s;aid unto them, This is that which the Lord hath &s;aid, To morrow is the Re&s;t of the Holy Sabbath to the Lord; then ye &s;hall not find it in the field; &s;ix days ye &s;hall gather it, but on the &s;eventh day (which is the Sabbath) in it there &s;hall be none: See, for the Lord hath given you the Sabbath; therefore he giveth you on the &s;ixth day the bread of two days: Abide every man in his place, let no man go out on the Sabbath day. So the people re&s;ted on the &s;eventh day.</HI></P>
<P>YOU will ea&s;ily ob&s;erve from the whole of this pa&s;&s;age, that it &s;uppo&s;es the people of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> acquainted with the Law of the Sabbath. It was not now In&s;tituted, but the In&s;titution was <HI>im|proved</HI> and acted on; fir&s;t <HI>by God</HI> in his Provi|dence for the magnifying the Day to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> a double portion of <HI>Manna</HI> falling (it is likely) on the &s;ixth day; and then <HI>by the People,</HI> they gather|ing thereon the portion of two days.</P>
<P>THIS was before the peoples arrival at <HI>Sinai,</HI> even upon their entring into the Wilderne&s;s; and it remained to them thro' it a la&s;ting Sign and Miracle from heaven in honour of the Sab|bath day. For if on any other day of the week they left of their <HI>manna</HI> till the morning <HI>it bred worms and &s;tank,</HI> but it kept good and &s;weet when they laid it up for the Sabbath day.</P>
<P>"THUS the Law of the Sabbath was given to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> before the delivery of the Law from <HI>Sinai,</HI> and the Day was kept before the <HI>Deca|logue</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="002620_0011_0FDB14D700774728">was given: the In&s;titution was <HI>before</HI> the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Edwards.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">III. THE Law of the Sabbath was <HI>one of the ten Words, the ten Commandments, given from Sinai,</HI> in that augu&s;t and fearful manner as you all know. On <HI>Sinai</HI> God repeated this his Law <HI>out of the mid&s;t of the fire.</HI> God him&s;elf came down that day from Heaven with his mighty Angels; he came down in thick darkne&s;s and flames of devouring fire: <HI>Sinai was altogether in a &s;moke and the mountain quaked greatly;</HI> the Congregation below were ready to <HI>die</HI> with fear le&s;t the light|nings &s;hould con&s;ume them. <HI>Who of all fle&s;h,</HI> but <HI>they</HI> in that &s;ingular day, <HI>ever heard the voice of the living God &s;peaking out of the mid&s;t of the fire and lived?</HI> In this manner did the great God give the <HI>fourth Commandment</HI> unto his Church, that they &s;hould <HI>remember</HI> it and <HI>keep</HI> it for ever, and not dare to forget it. Deu. 4.9, 10. <HI>Only take heed to thy &s;elf and keep thy &s;oul diligently, le&s;t thou forget the things which thy eyes have &s;een, and le&s;t they de|part from thy heart all the days of thy life; e&s;pecially the day that thou &s;toode&s;t before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord &s;aid unto me, Gather the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they &s;hall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their Children.</HI>&mdash;O that we and our Children may ever <HI>remember</HI> how, in what maje&s;ty and terror, God has commanded us to keep holy the Sabbath day.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002620_0012_0FDB14D8B61980A8">
I need not add, how that after the great God had &s;poken this Law from heaven, he al&s;o <HI>wrote it on a Table of &s;tone,</HI> with his own finger, to perpetuate the Remembrance and ob&s;ervation of it; and to imprint it upon <HI>the harder</HI> hearts and con&s;ciences of men: And he only who wrote in the Table of &s;tone, can write it on the <HI>fle&s;hly tables of our hearts.</HI> And that the whole might be yet more reverend and &s;anctifying to us, he laid it up within the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> under the <HI>Mercy-&s;eat.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, It plea&s;ed the Holy God to <HI>en|large,</HI> in many weighty words, on this Law of the Sabbath, when he came down on <HI>Sinai.</HI> He charged them to <HI>remember</HI> this Law: he call'd it <HI>the Sabbath of the Lord their God:</HI> he told them <HI>when,</HI> and <HI>how,</HI> and <HI>why</HI> he &s;anctified it. There is &s;omething very <HI>awful</HI> in God's u&s;ing all the&s;e obliging and con&s;training words. 'Twas a Law worthy to be thus <HI>&s;olemnly</HI> revived and <HI>long</HI> in|&s;i&s;ted on: a very <HI>important</HI> point for the <HI>honour</HI> of God and our <HI>Salvation.</HI>&mdash;Wherefore let the Maje&s;ty of <HI>that Day</HI> be evermore in the eyes and ears and hearts of the people of God.&mdash;To go on,</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE Law of the Sabbath was <HI>repeated and inculcated upon the delivery of the Ceremonial and Judicial Law;</HI> yea it was <HI>in&s;erted</HI> into the latter, as being indeed a line and hedge about all the Statutes and Judgments of God given by the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> to keep them all from being broken. For indeed piety and religion, and al&s;o ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s, flouri&s;h or decline
<PB N="8" REF="002620_0013_0FDB14D9F744E148">among the Covenant people of God, as the <HI>Sab|bath</HI> is &s;anctified or profaned among them. A &s;pecial honour is put upon the <HI>fourth Command|ment,</HI> and a &s;pecial reverence to it is required from us, by God's repeating it to his Church on the&s;e great Occa&s;ions. I will name them di|&s;tinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE have in my <HI>Text and Context</HI> the Law of the Sabbath repeated <HI>upon the delivery of the Ceremonial Law.</HI> God having fini&s;h'd here his Orders and directions to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> concerning the Tabernacle of the Congregation, the Ark, the Mercy-&s;eat, and all the furniture of the Taber|nacle; the Table, the Candle&s;tic, and the Altar of Incen&s;e, the Altar of burnt-offering, the La|ver and his foot; the Holy Garments, the anointing Oil and the &s;weet Incen&s;e; Then the Lord added,&mdash; <HI>Speak thou unto the Children of I&s;rael, Verily my Sabbaths you &s;hall keep; it is a &s;ign between me and you thro' out your Generations,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOW the mo&s;t learned <HI>Expo&s;itors</HI> upon my Text agree, that this Commandment is here re|peated on this Occa&s;ion, that &s;o the people of God might not think that <Q>even the &s;acred work of the Tabernacle might be done upon the Sabbath day.</Q> Even that Work of God, of whatever importance, nece&s;&s;ity and ha&s;te it were, would not warrant them to break the holy Re&s;t of God's Day. Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> therefore gives the Sen&s;e of my text thus, <HI>Verily my Sabbaths you &s;hall keep;</HI> i. e. <Q>notwith&s;tanding the work of the Tabernacle be holy, and diligently and &s;peedi|ly to be done, yet I'll not have any of it done on the Sabbath day. And &s;o Mr. <HI>Henry,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="002620_0014_0FDB14DFFA433110">Even Tabernacle-work mu&s;t give way to the Sabbath re&s;t:</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sic volo i&s;ta fieri, ut nihilominus opifices ce&s;&s;ent Sabbatho opere. <HI>Pareus in loc.</HI>
<P>They might not think this &s;acred Work would war|rant them to break the Sabbath. Bp. <HI>Patrick.</HI></P></NOTE> It means the work and labour of preparing and rearing the Tabernacle; not the Holy Services of it afterward; for &s;o the Prie&s;ts profaned the Sabbath and were guiltle&s;s; their Labours being in them&s;elves holy, like the work of Mini&s;ters on the Lord's days under the Go&s;pel. So God him&s;elf has given the di&s;tincti|on between &s;ervile and holy work or labours. Lev. 23.25.</P>
<P>BUT the true and great <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> as it &s;eems to me, why God repeated the Law of his Sab|bath unto I&s;rael upon his giving the <HI>Ceremonial Law</HI> to them, was this&mdash; Becau&s;e the Cere|monial law was originally de&s;igned by God, and always &s;ubordinated and &s;ub&s;ervient unto <HI>the Sanctification of the Sabbath,</HI> in the wor&s;hip and &s;ervices of the Tabernacle and Temple. It was eminently in&s;tituted for this one end, the &s;olem|nizing of the Lord's Sabbaths at the Tabernacle. Then the offerings and &s;acrifices were <HI>doubled,</HI> and therefore nece&s;&s;arily the Services of the Prie&s;ts. The&s;e were made <HI>for the Sabbath;</HI> and therefore no wonder that when the&s;e were in|&s;tituted the Law of the Sabbath was repeated. But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Judicial Law</HI> which God gave to I&s;|rael by the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> had the Law of the Sabbath <HI>in&s;erted into it</HI> This foren&s;ic or judicial Law was for the <HI>Civil Government</HI> of that Peo|ple
<PB N="10" REF="002620_0015_0FDB14E24F8AE990">of God, and contained a <HI>Body</HI> or Sy&s;tem of Laws to be ob&s;erved by the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> and Ru|lers, for the good order and peaceable and quiet living of the people, in all Godline&s;s and ho|ne&s;ty. The&s;e <HI>Judgments</HI> Mo&s;es began to &s;et be|fore them, by order from God, pre&s;ently after the delivery of the moral Law or ten Com|mandments. You have a great part of them in the 21, 22, and 23. <HI>Chapters</HI> of <HI>Exodus:</HI> And at the 12. <HI>ver&s;e</HI> of the 23.

<PB N="12" REF="002620_0017_0FDB14E548327320">then God wou'd take the work into his own hand, and cut him off by a &s;troke from hea|ven. This the Sabbath breaker might ju&s;tly fear, and no doubt often &s;uffer'd.</Q> But the <HI>&s;pi|ritual</HI> Judgment of God and his Eternal puni&s;h|ment of this Sin, is infinitly greater. And if men de&s;pi&s;e God's Sabbaths, as it provokes him greatly to <HI>cut them off</HI> from among his people now, &s;o without repentance he will <HI>cut them off</HI> for ever.</ITEM>

<P>BY the immediate and direct Command of the High God the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> open and pre&s;umptuous breaker of the Sabbath was puni&s;hed with <HI>death.</HI> You have the melancholly and di&s;mal Story, <HI>Num.</HI> 15. from the 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, to the 36. ver&s;e. <HI>And while the Children of I&s;rael were in the wilderne&s;s, they found a man that gathered &s;ticks on the Sabbath day: and they bro't him to Mo&s;es and unto Aaron, and all the Congregation: And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, the Man &s;hall be &s;urely put to death; all the Congregation &s;hall &s;tone him with &s;tones without the Camp: And he died, as the Lord commanded Mo&s;es.</HI> God made him an <HI>Example,</HI> to deter others for evermore from the like Sin.</P>
<P>BUT then al&s;o, God has in his <HI>Holy Providence</HI> dreadfully judg'd and puni&s;h'd for the Sin of Sabbath-breaking. How many he cuts off by <HI>untimely deaths</HI> for this &s;in we know not; but there is rea&s;on to fear they may be many. Read the threatning and warning, <HI>Levit,</HI> 26.31, 34.

<P>AFTER this manner <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> pre&s;cribes and re|quires the keeping a Sabbath: how &s;piritual and reverend! and thus <HI>from one Sabbath to another</HI> &s;hould <HI>all fle&s;h come and wor&s;hip before the</HI> Lord. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 66.23.</P>
<P>LET us pa&s;s on to the Prophecies of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> and ob&s;erve how he al&s;o in&s;i&s;ts on the Sanctifica|tion of the Sabbath. Jer. 17.20, 22. <HI>Hear ye the word of the Lord ye Kings of Judah, and all the Inha|bitants of Jeru&s;alem that enter in by the&s;e gates; thus &s;aith the Lord, Take heed to your &s;elves and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the Gates of Jeru&s;alem; neither do ye any work, but hal|low the Sabbath day as I commanded your Fathers.</HI> This Commandment was to the <HI>King</HI> and all the people together: The highe&s;t and lowe&s;t are equally under this Law and mu&s;t be obedient. And to the <HI>Rulers</HI> it belongs to &s;ee to it that the Sabbath be &s;anctified by their People.</P>
<P>A like Order both to Prince and pea&s;ant, for the religious ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath we have from the pen of the prophet <HI>Ezehiel,</HI> 46. Chap. 1,2. <HI>The Gate of the inner Court that looketh toward

<P>IN this frame and &s;pirit we find <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and the Princes, Prie&s;ts and Levites with him, <HI>&s;igning a Covenant to walk in the Laws of God and to keep his Sabbath.</HI> Nehem 10.31. We cannot walk in God's laws and not keep his Sabbaths; In our Covenanting with God to walk in his laws, we do in a &s;pecial manner covenant to keep his Sabbaths. This is a &s;pecial <HI>Article</HI> in God's <HI>Covenant</HI> with his People.</P>
<P>THUS have the Holy prophets <HI>in&s;i&s;ted</HI> on the Ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath in their days and times.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. THE Prophets of the Lord have made <HI>ma|ny great and precious Promi&s;es</HI> to the people of God, in ca&s;e of their <HI>religious Ob&s;ervation of the Holy Sabbath.</HI> The God who has ble&s;&s;ed the &s;eventh day and put his Name upon it, will ble&s;s all them that keep it holy. <HI>Spiritual Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> are the &s;pe|cial and more natural fruit of Sabbath Sanctifi|cation; but the <HI>outward</HI> ble&s;&s;ings of Providence are al&s;o the reward of it. This is the way to en&s;ure the &s;piritual and temporal Ble&s;&s;ing toge|ther. I&s;ai. 56.2. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that doeth this, that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it.</HI> This brings a ble&s;&s;ing on all our imployments, but e&s;pecially upon our Souls. Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ing, yea <HI>all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly places,</HI> is the promi&s;e to the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> that keeps God's Sabbaths. I&s;ai. 56.4, 5, 6. <HI>For thus &s;aith the Lord to them that keep my Sabbaths, and choo&s;e the things that plea&s;e me, and take hold of my Covenant; even to them will I give in my Hou&s;e and within my Walls, a place and a name better than of Sons and Daughters; I will give them an everla&s;t|ing name that &s;hall not be cut off:&mdash; I will bring them to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in
<PB N="18" REF="002620_0023_0FDB158201AF1378">my hou&s;e of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their Sa|crifices &s;hall be accepted upon mine Altar.</HI></P>
<P>NOTE here, That the&s;e <HI>three</HI> things go to|gether; the religious Ob&s;ervation of the Sab|bath, the Choo&s;ing the things that plea&s;e God, and the taking hold of his Covenant. Look where you will and &s;hew me one that keeps God's Sabbaths, and you &s;hall find him one that in all other points likewi&s;e chu&s;es the things that plea&s;e him; And &s;uch may and will and do lay hold of God's Covenant. It is from a &s;incere univer&s;al de&s;ire of plea&s;ing God and glorifying him, that the pious wor&s;hippers of God &s;et them|&s;elves to ob&s;erve and keep his Sabbaths. Such have (thro' grace) con&s;ented and come up to the Terms of God's Covenant, have taken him for their God, his Word for their Rule, and giv|en them&s;elves up to him, in his holy ways and among his people.</P>
<P>AND now how great and precious are the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> made here to this holy Sabbatizer? even all the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant of Grace are a&s;&s;ured to him; pre&s;ent peace and communion with God and &s;upplies of Grace, and the ever|la&s;ting love and mercies of our Heavenly Father. They have a <HI>Name</HI> among the Children of God, a Name in the Church on earth, a Name writ|ten in Heaven; an everla&s;ting Name that &s;hall not be cut off.&mdash; Thus the <HI>Spiritual Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> is the Promi&s;e to the <HI>per&s;on</HI> that keeps God's Sabbaths. And then</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Temporal</HI> ble&s;&s;ing is promi&s;ed to the <HI>People</HI> that do this. To prove this I need only turn you again to the 58. I&s;ai. 13, 14. <HI>If thou call
<PB N="19" REF="002620_0024_0FDB1583118686C8">the Sabbath a delight,</HI> &amp;c <HI>Then &s;halt thou delight thy &s;elf in the Lord, and I will cau&s;e thee to ride up|on the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the Heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it.</HI> Here are the temporal Re|wards; even riches, honour, power, &s;afety, pro&s;|perity and dignity; to the place and people, the Country or Nation, that keep God's Sabbaths.</P>
<P>GOD promis'd his <HI>I&s;rael</HI> that he wou'd make them high in Name and honour, if they &s;ought his honour and ob&s;erv'd his will; and that their Nei'bours &s;hould &s;ee him ble&s;s them. He pro|mi&s;ed them to feed 'em, to defend 'em, and to advance 'em. He promis'd that if they would zealou&s;ly and religiou&s;ly keep his appointed <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> no man &s;hould de&s;ire their Land when they went up unto 'em. He al&s;o bid them prove him, if he did not open the Heavens over them to pour down Ble&s;&s;ings, if they duly regarded his Wor&s;hip and Sanctuary. And doubtle&s;s this will always commend a People to his favour and ble&s;&s;ing in the cour&s;e of his Providence; and he will be their &s;hield and &s;trength, and the lifter up of their head.</P>
<P>IN a Word, We have the promi&s;e and the threatning repeated, the Ble&s;&s;ing and the Cur&s;e; Jer. 17.24, 25, 27. <HI>And it &s;hall some to pa&s;s if ye diligently hearken to me, &s;aith the Lord, to bring in no burden thro' the gates of this City on the Sabbath day; but if ye hallow the &s;ame;&mdash; then &s;hall there enter &s;till into it Kings and Princes &s;itting upon the Throne of David, riding in Chariots and on hor&s;es; and this City &s;hall remain for ever; and burnt-offer|ings and &s;acrifices, meat-offerings and Incen&s;e of prai&s;e,
<PB N="20" REF="002620_0025_0FDB15874EE3A158">&s;hall &s;till be in the hou&s;e of the Lord:&mdash; But if ye will not hearken unto me, to hallow the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in the Gates of Jeru&s;alem, which &s;hall devour its palaces,</HI> (whereof the <HI>Temple</HI> was a principal one) <HI>and it &s;hall not he quenched.</HI>&mdash;That is to &s;ay,</P>
<P>THE religious Sanctification of God's Sab|baths would have been a means of pre&s;erving the <HI>Royal Hou&s;e of David,</HI> and the <HI>Holy City</HI> of God; But for the profanation of the Sabbath both the one and the other were bro't to ruine. The prophet a&s;&s;ured them from God, that in ca&s;e they would keep <HI>his Day,</HI> He would keep the <HI>Court,</HI> the <HI>City,</HI> the <HI>Country</HI> and the <HI>Church,</HI> and make all to flouri&s;h: But on the contrary, if they went on to profane the Lord's Sabbaths, the Lord would de&s;troy them <HI>all</HI> together. And &s;o it was: The <HI>Enemy</HI> prevailed again&s;t <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and kindled a <HI>fire</HI> in the Gates of the City, which burnt down the <HI>Palace</HI> of the King and the <HI>Tem|ple</HI> of God, and none could quench it.</P>
<P>AND thus I have &s;hewn <HI>thro' Mo&s;es and the Prophets,</HI> how &s;trictly and vehemently the Holy God has required and inculcated the Sanctifica|tion of the <HI>Sabbath day.</HI></P>
<P>WHICH was the thing to be prov'd,&mdash; <HI>Verily my Sabbaths ye &s;hall keep.</HI> The <HI>In&s;tances</HI> given, from the precept to <HI>Adam</HI> unto and by the la&s;t of the <HI>Prophets,</HI> are &s;o many plain and affecting <HI>proofs,</HI> as well as &s;ingular <HI>Illu&s;trations,</HI> of my <HI>Doctrine.</HI> The <HI>method</HI> which I have taken is, I think, the mo&s;t <HI>&s;imple</HI> and natural Expo&s;ition of what the <HI>Scripture</HI> has &s;aid upon this head, &s;o far as I have gone.&mdash; God ble&s;s what we have heard for

Many a high Exerci&s;e of <HI>devotion,</HI> and many a good work of <HI>charity,</HI> did he upon the Sabbath-day.

<P>GOD's Sabbaths were to the <HI>Jews</HI> a &s;ign of his &s;electing them from other people and con&s;ecrating them unto him&s;elf, his wor&s;hip and &s;ervice; to be unto him as <HI>a kingdom of prie&s;ts, a holy nation.</HI> If he had not &s;o <HI>&s;et 'em apart</HI> for him&s;elf, he would not have <HI>revealed</HI> to them his Sabbaths, to <HI>&s;et up</HI> his Wor&s;hip a|mong them: And they that wor&s;hip him mu&s;t be <HI>&s;anctified,</HI> mu&s;t &s;anctify them&s;elves hereunto.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, The Ob&s;ervation of the <HI>Sab|bath</HI> ever was, is and will be, a &s;pecial <HI>means</HI> of the Sanctification of God's Elect.

<P>THUS the <HI>Holy Sabbaths</HI> of God do exhibit him unto us, not only as the Lord our <HI>Creator</HI> and <HI>Redeemer,</HI> but al&s;o as the Lord our <HI>Sancti|fier.</HI> Not only is the Sabbath ordained to &s;erve unto the honour and wor&s;hip of God <HI>the Father Almighty,</HI> Maker of Heaven and Earth; and of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> his only Son our Saviour, but al&s;o

<P>SANCTIFICATION is the &s;pecial work of the <HI>Holy and Eternal Spirit of God.</HI> In remem|brance of <HI>his glorious de&s;cent</HI> from the A&s;cended Saviour we keep our <HI>Lord's days.</HI> He is in his Word and Ordinances, the which he has in|&s;pired and in&s;tituted, and makes them the ef|fectual means of holine&s;s unto all &s;incere and fervent Wor&s;hippers.</P>
<P>HE is him&s;elf the <HI>Holy One,</HI> infinitly holy. He would have <HI>us</HI> holy. He only can make us &s;o. His <HI>Sabbaths</HI> and wor&s;hip are holy, and <HI>&s;anctifying</HI> to us.
