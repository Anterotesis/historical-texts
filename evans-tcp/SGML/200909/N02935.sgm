<P>Unto me, who am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints is this Grace given; that I &s;hould preach among the Gentiles the un&s;earchable Riches of Chri&s;t.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN the&s;e humble and lofty Words the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> lays <HI>him&s;elf</HI> low, while he mag|nifies his <HI>Office,</HI> and exalts the free <HI>Grace</HI> of God that call'd him into it, qualify'd him for it and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. HE magnifies his <HI>Office</HI> as the <HI>Apo&s;tle of the Gen|tiles.</HI> It was a great Honour and &s;pecial Dignity in the Kingdom of Chri&s;t and of Grace. With this the <HI>Chap|ter</HI> begins, <Q>I Paul, the Pri&s;oner of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for you Gentiles! If ye have heard of the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Grace of God, which is given me to you ward.</Q> The Go&s;pel of the <HI>Uncircumci&s;ion</HI> was given to <HI>Paul,</HI> as that of the <HI>Circumci&s;ion</HI> was unto <HI>Peter.</HI> Not but that they both preached occa&s;ionally to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gen|tiles,</HI> but <HI>Peter's</HI> Mi&s;&s;ion was more e&s;pecially to the
<PB N="2" REF="003520_0004_0FF855D145F2F6E8">One, and <HI>Paul's</HI> to the Other. When the LORD appeared to him in the Light from Heaven on the Way, he then declar'd him to be <HI>a cho&s;en Ve&s;&s;el to bear his Name before the Gentiles.</HI> This was his <HI>Mitre</HI> and e|&s;teemed Crown, this the mighty <HI>See</HI> into which he was cho&s;en. 1 Tim. ii. 7. <HI>I am ordained a Teacher of the Gentiles in Faith and Verity.</HI> It is &s;trange that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> &s;hould not magnify their <HI>own</HI> Apo&s;tle; that the <HI>Roman Church</HI> &s;hould give the <HI>Primacy</HI> to <HI>Peter.</HI> In this <HI>Paul</HI> came not a whit behind the very <HI>Chief</HI> of the Apo&s;tles, yet he was <HI>Metropolitan of the Gentiles,</HI> but not <HI>of Man,</HI> neither <HI>by Man,</HI> but by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t and God the Father,</HI> Gal. i. 1.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Gentiles</HI> were alike <HI>Souls</HI> and <HI>Sinners,</HI> that need|ed a Saviour, as the <HI>Jews.</HI> The Jews indeed call'd them <HI>uncircumci&s;ed and unclean,</HI> and they had lo&s;t the Knowledge of God, and were defiled with abominable Idolatries and Impurities. Yet <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Prophets</HI> had &s;poken abundantly of their Conver&s;ion; that CHRIST &s;hould be <HI>a Light to lighten the Gentiles, and for Salvation to the Ends of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Gentiles</HI> were va&s;tly <HI>more</HI> for Numbers, Power, Riches, Literature, worldly Name and Glory, than the <HI>few and feeble Jews</HI> were. They were mighty Nations, potent Kingdoms, populous Cities and va&s;t Empires; while <HI>Judea</HI> was &s;unk into a tributary Province, or de|pendant Kingdom on proud <HI>Rome.</HI> The Gentiles were <HI>Rome, Athens, Corinth</HI> and the <HI>Schools of Greece,</HI> who then divided the Learning of the World among them. To convert <HI>The&s;e</HI> to the Faith of Chri&s;t was <HI>Paul</HI> called and &s;ent from Heaven, and well might he &s;ay, &mdash; <HI>That to me this Grace is given!</HI> Wherefore</P>
<P N="2">2. HE lays <HI>Him&s;elf very low,</HI> "To me, who am <HI>le&s;s than the lea&s;t</HI> of all Saints is this Grace given, that <HI>I</HI> &s;hould preach among the Gentiles &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>HERE is a double <HI>Diminutive,</HI> &s;ays One; He was as little as <HI>could be</HI> in his own Eyes, and therefore writes him&s;elf &s;o little as could <HI>not</HI> be; <HI>le&s;s than the lea&s;t.</HI></Q> <HI>Longe minimus;</HI> by far the lea&s;t, <HI>Minimi&s;&s;imo;</HI> He was a <HI>Minim,</HI> an Animalcule in his own Eyes, after all that Heaven had done to aggrandize him. So <HI>before Honour
<PB N="3" REF="003520_0005_0FF855D2C9EC3110">is Humility,</HI> and true Humility increa&s;es with Worth and Excellency, and the Honours of Providence. The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> always look'd back on what he <HI>had been</HI> before his Calling into the Apo&s;tle&s;hip of Chri&s;t: 1 Cor. xv. 9. <HI>I am not meet to be called an Apo&s;tle becau&s;e I per&s;ecuted the Church of God</HI> 1 Tim. 1.13. <HI>Who was before a Bla&s;|phemer, a Per&s;ecutor and Injurious; but I obtained Mercy.</HI> He therefore &s;peaks <HI>highly</HI> of him&s;elf in the Text, where he calls him&s;elf the <HI>lea&s;t of Saints;</HI> if compar'd with what he &s;ays el&s;ewhere, "<HI>I am the chief of Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>YET in the <HI>Text,</HI> 1. He acknowledges him&s;elf thro' Grace among the <HI>Saints.</HI> And 2. Mo&s;t <HI>highly</HI> honour|ed and dignified among them: 1. In his <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> 2. In his <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> to preach <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Riches</HI> to them.</P>
<P>Now in all this the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> is a &s;hining <HI>Ex|ample</HI> and <HI>Monitor</HI> to all of us, both Mini&s;ters and Peo|ple; 1. That we &s;hould be <HI>Saints.</HI> 2. Yet always in our own Eyes the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> of them, and <HI>le&s;s</HI> than the lea&s;t. And 3. That we &s;hould be exceeding <HI>affected</HI> with the &s;ingular <HI>Grace</HI> of God to us, that <HI>we</HI> &s;hould be called into his Kingdom, whether to <HI>preach</HI> the un&s;earchable Riches of Chri&s;t to others, or to have the &s;ame <HI>preached</HI> to us.</P>

I.

The <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> to be &s;ure implies the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and if the <HI>Members</HI> of the Churches wear the Name of <HI>Saints,</HI> the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> of them &s;hould be nothing le&s;s.</P>
<P>MINISTERS &s;hould be <HI>holy Men of God,</HI> like the Prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> in the Spirit of <HI>Elias;</HI> and like <HI>Aaron the Saint of the Lord,</HI> on the Front of who&s;e <HI>Mitre</HI> was written, <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord.</HI> When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> pray'd for the Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> his <HI>own</HI> Tribe, and for the Hou&s;e of his <HI>Brother</HI> cho&s;en to the Prie&s;thood; to the Mini|&s;try at the Sanctuary, and to teach <HI>Jacob</HI> God's Judg|ments and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> his Laws; "LORD, &s;aid he, <HI>let thy Urim be with thy Holy Ones.</HI> Their <HI>Separation</HI> to holy Mini&s;trations put the Name of <HI>Sanctity</HI> and Holine&s;s upon them, was a <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of it and &s;trong <HI>Obligation</HI> to it. It could not indeed <HI>make</HI> them holy in Heart and Life, but it was a <HI>Bond</HI> upon their Soul. As <HI>Aaron</HI> was told in the Pre&s;ence of all <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> on a &s;olemn Day and upon a mo&s;t awful Di&s;pen&s;ation; Lev. v. 3. <HI>I will be &s;anctified in Them that draw nigh Me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GOD</HI> is Holy, infinitely <HI>holy.</HI> A <HI>Man</HI> in &s;pecial Re|lation to God, &s;olemnly devoted to Him and imployed for Him, to &s;erve in his Hou&s;e and Wor&s;hip, and to mi|ni&s;ter under his Grace to the Sanctification and Salva|tion of Souls; is laid under the highe&s;t Engagements to be Him&s;elf holy. Ezek. xx. 41. <HI>I will accept you with your &s;weet Savour, and will be &s;anctified in You.</HI></P>
<P>WELL therefore did the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> name Him&s;elf One among the <HI>Saints</HI> of God, the <HI>&s;anctified in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Had he not been one of that <HI>Noble Order,</HI> he had not been meet to have been named an <HI>Apo&s;tle.</HI> The End and Scope of his Mini&s;try was to make Men <HI>Saints,</HI> by the Power and Ble&s;&s;ing of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> He dur&s;t not deny what he was by the Grace of God. The Churches were Witne&s;&s;es how <HI>holily &amp; unblameably</HI> he behav'd before them. He would not be reputed un&s;anctified, unholy or profane. If he had not been &s;anctified from the <HI>Womb,</HI> like <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> and ordain'd a Prophet to the
<PB N="5" REF="003520_0007_0FF855D6D48D3B00">Nations; yet on the Day that the <HI>Heavenly Light</HI> &s;truck him to the Ground, his Eyes were opened and his Heart was changed. Chri&s;t &s;ent him qualified and &s;pirit|ed as he had done the other Apo&s;tles; over whom and for whom He had prayed. Joh. xvii. 19. <HI>For their &s;akes I &s;anctify my &s;elf, that they may be &s;anctified.</HI> The un|clean Spirits therefore confe&s;s'd his Mini&s;try &amp; Saint&s;hip; "<HI>Je&s;us I know, and Paul I know.</HI></P>
<P>AND if <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> &s;hould be Saints, &s;o ought <HI>Chri&s;tian People</HI> al&s;o. They are <HI>called to be Saints,</HI> even <HI>all that in every place call upon the Name of Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 Cor. i. 2. <HI>All</HI> the Lord's Congregation &s;hould be <HI>Holy.</HI> They are under the Sign and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">nd of <HI>Holy Bapti&s;m</HI> The LORD has loved the Church, and given Him&s;elf for it, <HI>to &s;ancti|fy and clean&s;e it</HI> with the wa&s;hing of Water, by the Word. The&s;e are the outward Sign &amp; Means of Regeneration and inward Holine&s;s. <HI>There is one Body and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one Hope; One Lord, one Faith, one Bapti&s;m:</HI> And if the a&s;cended <HI>Je&s;us</HI> has received <HI>Gifts</HI> for Men, &s;ome <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> &amp; <HI>Teachers;</HI> and pour'd out his Sanctifying <HI>Spirit</HI> on them; It is for the Edifying of <HI>his Body,</HI> and to pre&s;ent unto Him&s;elf <HI>a glorious Church, not have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pot or wrinkle.</HI> This there|fore we wi&s;h (pray and preach for) your <HI>Sanctification!</HI> That <HI>the Offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, being &s;anctified by the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> That <HI>the God of Peace may &s;anctify you wholly, in Body Soul and Spirit; and pre&s;erve you blamele&s;s to the Coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the LORD had formed a <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> Church and Mini&s;try, this was the <HI>Me&s;&s;age</HI> to 'em and by 'em; Lev. xix. 2. <HI>Speak unto all the Congregation, and &s;ay to them, ye &s;hall be Holy, for I the Lord your God am Holy.</HI> And again, xx. 7. <HI>Sanctify your &s;elves,&mdash;for I am the Lord that &s;anctifieth you.</HI> And to the End of Scripture this is the Character of Chri&s;tians.

<P>LET what has been &s;aid be an awful ADMONITION and con&s;training <HI>Motive</HI> to us all, both Mini&s;ters &amp; People, to &s;ee to our <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> to God; that a &s;aving <HI>Change</HI> be pa&s;&s;ed on us; that we be regenerated and born again;

<P>LET us lie in the Du&s;t before the <HI>Holy One,</HI> and in the Pre&s;ence of all his Saints, for all our <HI>Unholine&s;s</HI> in Heart and Life, under our &s;pecial Obligations, Advantages and Profe&s;&s;ions; and let us be abhorring our &s;elves and re|penting in Du&s;t &amp; A&s;hes.

<P>AND as for the <HI>People of God,</HI> here is a plain but mo&s;t important <HI>Direction</HI> to them, in their <HI>Choice of a Pa&s;tor;</HI> Chu&s;e One whom you have Rea&s;on to e&s;teem a <HI>Saint,</HI> a converted and &s;anctified Per&s;on, who will follow after <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> and labour for <HI>your Conver&s;ion</HI> and Salvation; naturally caring for his own and your Souls, <HI>to &s;ave him|&s;elf and them that hear him</HI> &mdash; And &s;o I di&s;mi&s;s the <HI>fir&s;t Doctrine,</HI> "We are all called to be <HI>Saints,</HI> both Mini|&s;ters and People.</P>

The righ|teous Men of old de&s;ir'd to <HI>&s;ee</HI> the Things which <HI>we</HI> &s;ee, and to hear the Things which <HI>we</HI> hear They prophe|&s;ied of the Grace that is come to <HI>us.</HI> God has provided the <HI>better</HI> Things for us, that They without Us &s;hould not be made perfect. Unto <HI>us</HI> they did mini&s;ter the things that are now reported to You, by them that preach the Go&s;pel. Wherefore <HI>gird up</HI> the Loyns of your Mind, and <HI>lift up</HI> your Hearts and Hands in the Sanctu|ary, for the <HI>Grace</HI> that is brought to You at the Reve|lation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash; The Church of old &s;aw <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> come down <HI>&s;hining</HI> from the Mount, with the <HI>Tables</HI> in his Hands: But <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> are your Eyes and Ears that &s;ee and hear <HI>Je&s;us</HI> as it were preaching to the Multitudes on the Mountain, and <HI>transfigured</HI> in the Mount, with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> in their Glory waiting on Him.&mdash; When <HI>Balaam</HI> prophe&s;ied of <HI>Him that &s;hould come out of Jacob,</HI> to have the <HI>Dominion,</HI> he concluded thus, "<HI>Who &s;hall live when God doth this?</HI> We can tell him who &s;hall: <HI>We live</HI> when God has done it!

If we come to plead in Vain, <HI>Lord we have prophe&s;ied in thy Name, and thou ha&s;t taught in our Streets.</HI> Where and what will the <HI>Grace</HI> and Favour then be to us? It is received in vain, &amp; will but turn to our greater Wretchedne&s;s, Mi&s;ery &amp; Cur&s;e. As it is written, <HI>You only have I known of all the Fami|lies of the Earth, therefore will I puni&s;h you from your Iniquities. And thou Capernaum, which art exalted to Hea|ven &s;hall be bro't down to Hell; For if the mighty Works done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have repent|ed and remained. Wherefore it &s;hall be more tolerable in the 'Day of Judgment for Tire and Sidon than for You.</HI></P>

LET it be therefore our earne&s;t Care and Prayer that the Word preached be <HI>&s;avingly profitable</HI> to our Souls; that we receive that <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> which the Lord means us from his preached Go&s;pel. It were <HI>below His Grace</HI> to give a revealed <HI>Word,</HI> to in&s;titute a <HI>Sabbath,</HI> to ordain a <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> to appoint <HI>Ordinances,</HI> for any <HI>le&s;s</HI> End. He would have us come to the Knowledge of the Truth <HI>and be &s;aved.</HI> He &s;ends his <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> now, as He will his <HI>Angels</HI> hereafter, to <HI>gather in his Elect</HI> from the four Quarters of the Earth. The <HI>Election</HI> will receive his Grace, <HI>ob|tain</HI> his Mercy, while the re&s;t are <HI>blinded;</HI> blindly re|ject it. Give your Mini&s;ters the <HI>Joy</HI> of &s;aying to You, in the Words of the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians; "Know|ing, Brethren beloved, your Election of God! For our Go&s;|pel came not to You in Word only, but in the Power of the</HI> HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P>THIS, <HI>this</HI> is <HI>&s;aving</HI> Grace and Mercy! what <HI>Sinners</HI> &s;hould &s;eek, and what <HI>Saints</HI> may triumph in! what <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters</HI> &s;hould preach, and <HI>People</HI> hear for. El&s;e <HI>what go ye forth to &s;ee? A Reed &s;haken with the Wind!</HI> Or what go ye forth to <HI>hear? The Songs of Children in the Market,</HI> in their idle Plays! For can any thing an&s;wer to the Incarnation, Dying and Re&s;urrection of the <HI>Lord Je&s;us,</HI> but the <HI>Eternal Salvation of your precious Souls</HI> from Sin and Death and Hell? Or can the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> be given from on High, but for the <HI>piercing</HI> Sinners to the Heart, and to &s;et them a crying out, <HI>Sirs, What mu&s;t we do to be &s;aved!</HI> For what a <HI>Farce</HI> is this Solemnity of a preach|ed <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his un&s;earchable <HI>Riches</HI> turned into, if it have <HI>no Effect</HI> upon the Hearts &amp; Lives of Men? if it effect no change of Souls here, nor turn to their Salva|tion in the Life to come? Let us throw up our <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> and ca&s;t away our <HI>Bibles,</HI> and lay a&s;ide the Order and Work of a <HI>Mini&s;try;</HI> if they be not for the <HI>Conver&s;ion of Souls.</HI> But if <HI>this</HI> be the End and Fruit of a preached JESUS, how glorious is it and worthy of his ble&s;&s;ed Name! who&s;e Glory is infinite &amp; eternal in our Salvation.</P>
<P>READ then <HI>the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to us in his preached Go&s;pel, and let it animate both Mini&s;ters and People, as it in&s;pired holy <HI>Paul; "If by any Means I may &s;ave &s;ome! "I plea&s;e all Men in all things, &s;eck|ing their &s;piritual Profit that they may be &s;aved! "Whe|ther we be afflicted or comforted, it is for your Con&s;olation

<P>I have thus endeavoured in as few &amp; &s;trong Words as I could to repre&s;ent to You, the <HI>Grace given us</HI> in the Go&s;pel preached to us. And what are <HI>we</HI> in this wide and wild World, that to <HI>Us</HI> this <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing,</HI> and (if it be not our own Fault) this <HI>&s;aving</HI> Grace of God &s;hould be given and not to Others! or to <HI>Us</HI> more and in a better Manner than to many Others!</P>
<P>LET <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> Examine and judge them&s;elves before the Lord and his People: "How are <HI>we affected</HI> with the Grace of God to us, in his All-di&s;po&s;ing Providence re&s;pecting Us, putting us into the Mini&s;try! chu&s;ing for us our Lot &amp; Station! giving us an early &s;erious &amp; humble Mind for the great Work it &s;elf, and furni&s;hing us in any mea&s;ure for our Places! granting us any Tokens of his Pre&s;ence with us in our Mini&s;trations to the Souls of our re&s;pective Flocks! any Seals of our Mini&s;try, and Hopes of Glory with them at the Appearance of JESUS CHRIST! How do we, and how have we preached CHRIST &amp; his Riches to our People! and to what Effect on our own and their Souls together!</P>
<P>LET <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Mini&s;try learn with what Tem|per &amp; Exerci&s;e of Soul, with what kind of Affections, they &s;hould prepare for &amp; enter on it: beginning as they pur|po&s;e (by the Grace of God) to hold on, <HI>preaching Chri&s;t and his un&s;earchable Riches</HI> unto Souls ready to peri&s;h; that the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Chri&s;t and his <HI>Glory</HI> may re&s;t on 'em and &s;hine in 'em, and be the <HI>Alpha &amp; Omega, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t</HI> with them, in their holy Studies and public Per|formances.</P>
<P>LET them learn of <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Paul</HI> how &amp; what to <HI>preach,</HI> and with what Aims at the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of Souls: And therefore let them look unto their <HI>own</HI> Souls fir&s;t, &amp; give Diligence to make their own Effectual Cal|ling &s;ure: That they may be able to u&s;e &s;uch Words as the&s;e, <HI>"When it plea&s;ed God to call me by his Grace, and reveal his Son in me; that I &s;hould preach Him unto Others.</HI></P>

LET 'em give no Occa&s;ion to the Mini&s;ters &amp; Churches from their public Di&s;cour&s;es to fear or &s;ay, That they are going off to <HI>another</HI> Kind &amp; Way of Preaching, and that the &s;erious humble and earne&s;t Preaching of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>his Riches,</HI> for the Salvation of lo&s;t Souls, is not the plain Aim and Scope of their Mini&s;try.

I conclude with tho&s;e Words, from which your <HI>Aged venerable Pa&s;tor</HI> preached to the Church and Congrega|tion to Whom I mini&s;ter, <HI>two and thirty Years ago,</HI> Heb. xii. 14. <HI>Follow Peace with all Men, and Holine&s;s with|out which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI></P>
