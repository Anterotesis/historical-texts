<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><Q>FENELON has left us a treati&s;e on the education of women. Since his time, other authors, more or le&s;s celebrated, have written on the &s;ame &s;ubject; and there is &s;till room for a treati&s;e on female educa|tion. But to &s;upply that want is not the immediate de&s;ign of this piece: the Author here only pre&s;ents an hi&s;torical picture, an a&s;&s;emblage of facts and ob&s;ervations, which may &s;erve as the elements of a didactic work. It will perhaps &s;hew, that wo|men
<PB N="iv" REF="013650_0003_0F919BE08E92E560">are &s;u&s;ceptible of all the qualities which religion, &s;ociety, or government, would chu&s;e to a&s;&s;ign them.</Q></P>
<P>After the foregoing preamble, M. Thomas proceeds to tell us, that this E&s;&s;ay mu&s;t be con&s;idered as part of a Hi&s;tory of the Manners. Viewed in that light, it is perhaps the mo&s;t com|plete performance hitherto publi&s;hed; and it is indi&s;putably the mo&s;t ele|gant, and mo&s;t philo&s;ophical treati&s;e, on the female mind and female cha|racter. But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ex|cellencies, it appeared to the Editor to want a good deal more than tran&s;|lation to make it &s;atisfactory to the Engli&s;h reader. The &s;entences were often complicated, and the paragraphs tedious. It had none of tho&s;e larger divi&s;ions, which are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to re|lieve
<PB N="v" REF="013650_0004_0F919BE19828A970">the mind, nor any of tho&s;e in|ferior ones, which are not le&s;s e&s;&s;en|tial to the per&s;picuity of rea&s;oning. He therefore in &s;ome mea&s;ure decom|pounded it; he &s;plit the &s;entences, broke the paragraphs, and divided the work into parts and &s;ections: he omitted &s;ome things<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His omi&s;&s;ions con&s;i&s;t only of &s;uch things as &s;eemed foreign to the &s;ubject, and which can only intere&s;t a Frenchman, and a lover of <HI>&eacute;loge.</HI></NOTE>, and added others. What re|lates to the progre&s;s of &s;ociety in Britain is entirely new. In &s;hort, he is an|&s;werable for the defects of the E&s;&s;ay, as it now appears; though he has not the vanity to claim its beauties. Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the original, however, he doubts not will give him credit for his labours.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IF we take a &s;urvey of ages and of countries, we will find the women&mdash;almo&s;t without exception&mdash;at all times, and in all places, adored and oppre&s;&s;ed. Man, who has never neglected an op|portunity of exerting his power, in pay|ing homage to their beauty, has always availed him&s;elf of their weakne&s;s. He has been at once their tyrant and their &s;lave.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="013650_0008_0F919BE468830090">
Nature her&s;elf, in forming beings &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible and tender, appears to have been more attentive to their charms than their happine&s;s. Continually &s;urrounded with griefs and fears, the women more than &s;hare all our mi&s;eries, and are be|&s;ides &s;ubjected to ills which are peculiarly their own. They cannot be the means of life without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the lo&s;s of it. Every revolution which they undergo alters their health, and threatens their exi&s;tence. Cruel di&s;tem|pers attack their beauty&mdash;and the hour which confirms their relea&s;e from tho&s;e, is perhaps the mo&s;t melancholy of their lives. It robs them of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the mo&s;t endearing characteri&s;tic of their &s;ex. They can then only hope for protection from the humiliating claims of pity, or the feeble voice of gratitude.</P>
<P>Society, in&s;tead of alleviating their condition, is to them the &s;ource of new mi&s;eries. More than one half of the globe is covered with &s;avages; and,
<PB N="3" REF="013650_0009_0F919BE651DCD870">among all tho&s;e people, women are com|pletely wretched. Man, in a &s;tate of barbarity, equally cruel and indolent, ac|tive by nece&s;&s;ity, but naturally inclined to repo&s;e, is acquainted with little more than the phy&s;ical effects of love; and having none of tho&s;e moral ideas, which only can &s;often the empire of force, he is led to con&s;ider it as his &s;upreme law, &s;ubjecting to his de&s;poti&s;m tho&s;e whom rea&s;on had made his equals, but who&s;e imbecillity betrayed them to his &s;trength.</P>
<P>'Nothing' (&s;ays profe&s;&s;or Millar, &s;peaking of the women of barbarous na|tions,) <Q>can exceed the dependence and &s;ubjection in which they are kept, or the toil and drudgery which they are obliged to undergo.&mdash;The hu&s;band, when he is not engaged in &s;ome war|like exerci&s;e, indulges him&s;elf in idle|ne&s;s, and devolves upon his wife the whole burden of his dome&s;tic affairs. He di&s;dains to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in any of tho&s;e &s;ervile employments; &s;he &s;leeps in a different bed, and is &s;eldom permitted
<PB N="4" REF="013650_0010_0F919BE683450D28">to have any conver&s;ation, or corre&s;|pondence with him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations concerning the Di&s;tinction of Ranks in &s;ociety. See al&s;o Colhen's Voyage to the Cape of Good. Pope. <HI>Hi&s;toire Generale de Voyages,</HI> liv. 14 chap. 3. &s;ect. 4. Sale's Voyage to North America.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The women among the Indians of America are what the helots were among the Spartans, a vanqui&s;hed people obliged to toil for their conquerors. Hence, on the banks of the Oroonoko, we have &s;een mothers &s;laying their daughters out of compa&s;&s;ion, and &s;mothering them in the hour of their birth. They con&s;ider this barbarous pity as a virtue.</P>
<P>'The men' (&s;ays Commodore Byron, in his account of the inhabitants of South America,) <Q>exerci&s;e a mo&s;t de&s;potic au|thority over their wives, whom they con&s;ider in the &s;ame view they do any other part of their property, and di&s;|po&s;e of them accordingly: even their common treatment of them is cruel; for though the toil and hazard of pro|curing food lies entirely on the women,
<PB N="5" REF="013650_0011_0F919BE833FDA1A0">yet they are not &s;uffered to touch any part of it, till the hu&s;band is &s;atisfied; and then he a&s;&s;igns them their portion, which is generally very &s;canty, and &s;uch as he has not a &s;tomach for him&s;elf.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Byron's Narrative.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Among the nations of the Ea&s;t, we find another kind of de&s;poti&s;m and do|minion prevail&mdash;the &s;eraglio, and the dome&s;tic &s;ervitude of women, authori&s;ed by the manners, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the laws. In Turky, in Per&s;ia, in India, in Japan, and over the va&s;t empire of China, one half of the human &s;pecies is oppre&s;&s;ed by the other.</P>
<P>The exce&s;s of oppre&s;&s;ion in tho&s;e coun|tries &s;prings from the exce&s;s of love.</P>
<P>All A&s;ia is covered with pri&s;ons, where beauty in bondage waits the caprices of a ma&s;ter. The multitudes of women there a&s;&s;embled have no will, no incli|nations, but his. Their triumphs are
<PB N="6" REF="013650_0012_0F919BE93ADA4CA8">only for a moment; and their rivalry, their hate, and their animo&s;ities continue till death. There the lovely &s;ex are obliged to repay even their &s;ervitude with the mo&s;t tender affection; or, what is &s;till more mortifying, with the counterfeit of an affection which they do not feel: There the mo&s;t gloomy tyranny has &s;ubjected them to creatures, who, being of nei|ther &s;ex, are a di&s;honour to both: There, in &s;hort, their education tends only to debafe them; their virtues are forced; their very plea&s;ures are involuntary and joyle&s;s; and, after an exi&s;tence of a few years&mdash;till the bloom of youth is over&mdash; their period of neglect commences, which is long and dreadful.</P>
<P>In the temperate latitudes, where the climate giving le&s;s ardour to pa&s;&s;ion leaves more confidence in virtue, the wo|men have not been deprived of their li|berty; but a &s;evere legi&s;lation has at all times kept them in a &s;tate of dependence. One while they were confined to their own apartments, and debarred at once from bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ement; at ano|ther
<PB N="7" REF="013650_0013_0F919BE99C759D30">time, a tedious guardian&s;hip de|frauded their hearts and in&s;ulted their under&s;tandings. Affronted in one coun|try by poligamy, which gives them their rivals for their in&s;eparable companions; en&s;laved in another by indi&s;&s;oluble ties, which often join the gentle to the rude, and &s;en&s;ibility to brutality; even in coun|tries where they may be e&s;teemed mo&s;t happy, con&s;trained in their de&s;ires, in the di&s;po&s;al of their goods, robbed of freedom of will by the laws, the &s;laves of opinion, which rules them with ab&s;olute &s;way, and con&s;trues the &s;lighte&s;t appear|ances into guilt; &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by judges who are at once their tyrants and their &s;educers, and who, after having prepared their faults, puni&s;h every lap&s;e with di&s;honour&mdash;nay u&s;urp the right of degrading them on &s;u&s;picion; who does not feel for the tender &s;ex? Yet &s;uch, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, is the lot of women over the whole earth. Man, with regard to them, in all climates and in all ages, has been either an in&s;en&s;ible or an oppre&s;&s;or; but they have &s;ometimes experienced the cold and deliberate oppre&s;&s;ion of pride,
<PB N="8" REF="013650_0014_0F919BEA5165DB80">and &s;ometimes the violent and terrible tyranny of jealou&s;y. When they are not beloved, they are nothing; and when they are, they are tormented. They have almo&s;t equal cau&s;e to be afraid of indifference and of love. Over three quarters of the globe, nature has placed them between contempt and mi&s;ery.</P>
<Q><P>The melting de&s;ires, or the fiery pa&s;|&s;ions,' &s;ays profe&s;&s;or Fergufon, 'which in one climate take place between the &s;exes, are in another changed into a &s;ober con&s;ideration, or a patience of mutual di&s;gu&s;t. This change is re|marked in cro&s;&s;ing the Mediterranean, in following the cour&s;e of the Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi, in a&s;cending the mountains of Cauca&s;us, and in pa&s;&s;ing from the Alps and the Pyrenees to the &s;hores of the Baltic.</P>
<P>The burning ardours and the tor|turing jealou&s;ies of the &s;eraglio and the haram, which have reigned &s;o long in A&s;ia and Africa, and which in the &s;outhern parts of Europe have &s;carcely
<PB N="9" REF="013650_0015_0F919BEC34F21B90">given way to the difference of religion and civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, are found, however, with an abatement of heat in the climate, to be more ea&s;ily changed, in one latitude, into a temporary pa&s;|&s;ion which ingro&s;&s;es the mind, without enfeebling it, and which excites to ro|mantic atchievements: by a farther progre&s;s to the north, it is changed in|to a &s;pirit of gallantry, which employs the wit and fancy more than the heart; which prefers intrigue to enjoyment; and &s;ub&s;titutes affectation and vanity, where &s;entiment and de&s;ire have failed. As it departs from the &s;un, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion is farther compo&s;ed into a habit of dome&s;tic connection, or frozen into a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, under which the &s;exes at freedom &s;carcely chu&s;e to unite their &s;ociety.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on the Hi&s;tory of Civil Society, part iii. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE></P></Q>
<P>Even among a people where beauty re|ceived the highe&s;t homage, we find men who would deprive the &s;ex of every kind of reputation. <Q>The mo&s;t VIRTUOUS
<PB N="10" REF="013650_0016_0F919BEC9B5730F8">woman, &s;ays a celebrated Greek<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thucydides.</NOTE>, is &s;he who is lea&s;t talked of.</Q></P>
<P>That moro&s;e man, while he impo&s;es duties upon women, would deprive them of the &s;weets of public e&s;teem; and, in exacting virtues from them, would make it a crime to a&s;pire at honour.</P>
<P>If a woman were to defend the cau&s;e of her &s;ex, &s;he might addre&s;s him in the following manner.</P>
<Q><P>How great is your inju&s;tice! If we have an equal right with you to virtue, why &s;hould we not have an equal right to prai&s;e? The public e&s;teem ought to wait upon merit. Our duties are dif|ferent from yours; but they are not therefore le&s;s difficult to fulfil, or of le&s;s con&s;equence to &s;ociety: they are the fountains of your felicity, and the &s;weetners of life. We are wives and mothers. 'Tis we who form the union and the cordiality of families; 'tis we
<PB N="11" REF="013650_0017_0F919BED4AEE2C08">who &s;often that &s;avage rudene&s;s which con&s;iders every thing as due to force, and which would involve man with man in eternal war. We cultivate in you that humanity, which makes you feel for the misfortunes of others; and our tears forewarn you of your own danger. Nay, you cannot be ignorant, that we have need of courage not le&s;s than you. More feeble in our&s;elves, we have perhaps more trials to encoun|ter. Nature a&s;&s;ails us with &s;orrow, law and cu&s;tom pre&s;s us with con&s;traint, and &s;en&s;ibility and virtue alarm us by their continual conflicts. Sometimes al&s;o the name of citizen demands from us the tribute of fortitude. When you offer your blood to the &s;tate, think that it is ours. In giving it our &s;ons and our hu&s;bands, we give more than our&s;elves. You can only die on the field of battle, but we have the mis|fortune to &s;urvive tho&s;e whom we love mo&s;t.</P>
<P>Alas! while your ambitious vanity is uncea&s;ingly labouring to cover the
<PB N="12" REF="013650_0018_0F919BEE05FF6298">earth with &s;tatues, with monuments, and with in&s;criptions, to eternize if po&s;&s;ible your names, and give your|&s;elves an exi&s;tence when this body is no more, why mu&s;t we be condemned to live and to die unknown? Would you, that the grave and eternal forgetfulne&s;s &s;hould be our lot? Be not our tyrants in all. Permit our names to be &s;ome time pronounced beyond the narrow circle in which we live; permit friend|&s;hip, or at lea&s;t love, to in&s;cribe its emblems on the tomb where our a&s;hes repo&s;e; and deny us not that public e&s;teem, which, after the e&s;teem of one's &s;elf, is the &s;weete&s;t reward of well-doing.</P></Q>
<P>All men however, it mu&s;t be owned, have not been equally unju&s;t to their fair companions. In &s;ome countries public honours have been paid to women. Art has erected them monuments, eloquence has celebrated their virtues, and hi&s;tory has collected whatever could adorn their characters.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="013650_0019_0F919BEFFAB367A0">
Without entering into circum&s;tantial details, which might perhaps di&s;gu&s;t by their uniformity, I &s;hall inquire, in ge|neral, what are the qualities and the kinds of merit of which women are ca|pable; how far government, laws, and circum&s;tances can rai&s;e them; and &s;hall attempt to di&s;cover the &s;ecret connections of policy with their manners. I &s;hall then quickly examine what the women have been in different ages, and how the &s;pirit of their times, or of their nation has influenced their character.</P>
<P>This E&s;&s;ay, if I may &s;o &s;peak, will be a hi&s;tory of that part of the human &s;pe|cies, which the other flatters and calum|niates by turns&mdash;and frequently without knowing them. For it is with women as with &s;overeigns, they &s;eldom hear the truth; and we e&s;timate them more by in|tere&s;t and by humour, than by ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I neither mean to write a panegyric nor a &s;atire, but to make a collection of ob&s;ervations and of facts; in which may
<PB N="14" REF="013650_0020_0F919BF050D1F820">be &s;een, what the women have been, what they are, and what they ought to be.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. Of the great and virtuous Actions of WOMEN in general.</HEAD>
<P>WE find in the writings of Plutarch, the panegyri&s;t and the judge of &s;o many great men, a piece intituled, THE VIRTUOUS ACTIONS OF WOMEN. It is addre&s;&s;ed to one of the &s;ex, named CLEA, of whom we know little. But her con|nection with the philo&s;opher of Chaero|nea alone, has been deemed &s;ufficient, by &s;ome writers, to cla&s;s her among the number of learned women.</P>
<P>Plutarch begins his performance with blaming tho&s;e, who would deprive wo|men of that prai&s;e which is their due. 'One might,' &s;ays he, <Q>make a com|pari&s;on between Anacreon and Sappho, between Semiramis and Se&s;o&s;tris, be|tween Tanaquil and Servius, and be|tween Brutus and Portia. The talents
<PB N="15" REF="013650_0021_0F919BF10A1A3268">and the virtues are modified by the circum&s;tances and the per&s;ons, but the foundation is the &s;ame; the colour and the &s;urface, &s;o to &s;peak, are only dif|ferent.</Q></P>
<P>The philo&s;ophical hi&s;torian next pro|ceeds to mention a great number of wo|men of all nations, who have given ex|amples of their courage, and who have &s;hewn a generous contempt of death.</P>
<P>He in&s;tances the Phoenician women; who, before an engagement which threat|ened the de&s;truction of their city, agreed to bury them&s;elves in the flames, if the battle &s;hould be lo&s;t, and crowned with flowers the woman who fir&s;t made that motion in the council.</P>
<P>He tells us of other women, who, in a city be&s;ieged, made the men blu&s;h for a &s;hameful capitulation;&mdash;of women, who, &s;eeing their &s;ons and their hu&s;bands flee in battle, ran before them, and ob&s;tructed their pa&s;&s;age, forcing them to return, to death or to victory;&mdash;of women, who,
<PB N="16" REF="013650_0022_0F919BF1E73AE090">during the time of a &s;iege, mounted the walls, defended their city, and bravely repul&s;ed the enemy:&mdash;of women who re&s;i&s;ted de&s;poti&s;m and oppre&s;&s;ion, and who, as &s;oon as the tyrant was &s;lain, ran dancing before the con&s;pirators, and crowned them with their own hands;&mdash;of &s;ome, who them&s;elves gave liberty to their country;&mdash;of &s;everal, who expo&s;ed them&s;elves to death, and loaded them&s;elves with chains to &s;ave their captive hu&s;bands:&mdash;and he takes particular notice of Camma, who poi&s;oned her&s;elf at the altar, that &s;he might poi&s;on the murderer of her hu&s;band; and who, turning to|ward the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, &s;aid,</P>
<P><Q>I have only lived to revenge the death of my &s;pou&s;e&mdash;It is done. Thee, this moment, I order, in place of a nuptial bed, to prepare thy&s;elf a tomb.</Q></P>
<P>He likewi&s;e in&s;tances the women of Gaul, who, in the time of a civil war, threw them&s;elves between two armies ru&s;hing to battle, and &s;eparated, and re|conciled the combatants. As a reward
<PB N="17" REF="013650_0023_0F919BF4CF6C5D40">for which act of valour, they had the honour of being admitted into the public councils, and &s;ometimes of being cho&s;en the arbiters of nations.</P>
<P>To the&s;e great and generous qualities, by which women &s;eem to ri&s;e above them&s;elves, Plutarch has joined the &s;oft|er, and to men more attractive virtues, as being more natural to the &s;ex. He prai&s;es the women of an i&s;land of the Archipelago, where, during the cour&s;e of &s;even years, he &s;ays, there was neither an in&s;tance of weakne&s;s in a young per|&s;on, nor of infidelity in a married wo|man: &mdash; And he relates an anecdote of the Mile&s;ian virgins, which merits the attention of a philo&s;opher. Multitudes fell by their own hands &mdash; doubtle&s;s in that trying age, when nature giving birth to re&s;tle&s;s and turbulent de&s;ires, inflames the imagination; and when the heart, a&s;to|ni&s;hed at new wants, which virtue forbids it to gratify, feels pining melancholy &s;ucceed to the &s;portful tranquillity of childhood. Nothing could &s;top the con|tagion. A law was made condemning
<PB N="18" REF="013650_0024_0F919BF5B7C88480">the fir&s;t who &s;hould be guilty of &s;elf-mur|der, to be brought naked, and expo&s;ed in the market-place. Tho&s;e young women were not afraid of death; but they were afraid of &s;hame, even after death. Not one of them henceforth made an attempt upon her life.</P>
<P>Plutarch in the &s;ame piece relates ano|ther anecdote, which, even at this day, might afford an excellent le&s;&s;on of poli|tical oeconomy. A king, who believed that riches con&s;i&s;ted in gold, obliged the greater part of his &s;ubjects to labour in the mines. They all peri&s;hed. The re|maining inhabitants of the country had recour&s;e to the quen. She ordered an artificer to make privately the re&s;em|blance of bread, of meat, and of dif|ferent kinds of fruits, of gold; and, when the king returned from a journey, &s;he had them &s;erved up to him.

<HEAD>SECTION II. Of the Grecian WOMEN.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDES his general treati&s;e on the actions of women, Plutarch has left us a piece in honour of the Spartan dames. There he cites a variety of ex|pre&s;&s;ions, which demon&s;trate their cou|rage and vigour of mind; there we find beings and virtues very different from tho&s;e of the &s;ame &s;ex with which we have occa&s;ion to be acquainted: &mdash; Nature &s;acrificed to patrioti&s;m; honour ranked before affection; the name of citizen pre|ferred to the name of mother; tears of joy &s;hed over the body of a &s;on pierced
<PB N="20" REF="013650_0026_0F919BF7087C5148">with wounds; the maternal hands armed again&s;t a &s;on guilty of cowardice; the mandate of death conveyed to a &s;on &s;u&s;|pected of a crime; and &s;orrow, and even compa&s;&s;ion, regarded as a weakne&s;s, or as an in&s;ult! &mdash;</P>
<P>He gives us a &s;ingular in&s;tance, in a Spartan woman, of intrepidity and forti|tude in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude. A pri&s;oner, and &s;old as a &s;lave, the que&s;tion was put to her, 'What knowe&s;t thou?' &mdash; 'To be free!' &s;he replied; and, when her ma&s;ter commanded what &s;he deemed ig|nominious, &s;he cooly &s;aid, <Q>You are unworthy of me:</Q> and re&s;igned her&s;elf to death.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have not been accu&s;tomed to look beyond their own times, and who conclude what women have been, from what they are; and tho&s;e, more particu|larly, who are ignorant what e&s;&s;ects a legi&s;lation conceived in one head, and combined in all its branches, can produce on the mind, will be at a lo&s;s to compre|hend, how a &s;ex that &s;eems rather formed
<PB N="21" REF="013650_0027_0F919BF7C97E5028">for &s;en&s;ibility than fortitude, &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much courage. It &s;prung from the vigour of ancient laws.</P>
<P>Among the Greeks, who were almo&s;t all republicans, the manners of the wo|men became nece&s;&s;arily bold and au&s;tere. The retreats where they &s;pent their lives &s;ubdued their de&s;ires; the poverty of the public denied the means of corruption; and the apprehen&s;ion of national honour exalted their &s;entiments. They had an ambition of not being behind their &s;ons, their brothers, and their hu&s;bands; and, not being able to attract them by feminine arts, they boldly trod in their foot&s;teps.</P>
<P>Other cau&s;es co-operated to place the women of tho&s;e early ages on a level with the men. In the era of the formation of &s;tates, when &s;ociety is only emerging from barbari&s;m, the toils and the dangers of the two fexes are nearly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The republics, or the kingdoms of Greece, con&s;i&s;ting often only of one city, were continually either threatened with
<PB N="22" REF="013650_0028_0F919BF8830262C0">war, or were the &s;cene of blood. National animo&s;ities, inflamed by the cla&s;hing of intere&s;ts, were more ardent, and le&s;s ea&s;ily extingui&s;hed than in our times. The wars of Europe are now only the means, and the manner of deciding the quarrels of princes: they were then the awakened pa&s;&s;ions of the people. The inhabitants of one &s;tate fought for the lives of the inhabitants of another. Vic|tory condemned the women to &s;lavery. Such a condition was an a&s;ylum again&s;t death, and might &s;ometimes be alleviated by the favour of a ma&s;ter, but could never protect them from di&s;honour.</P>
<P>The uncertainty of the laws, in the particular &s;tates of Greece, and the &s;hocks of liberty, opened a door to tyrants. The right to command, was then a right to abu&s;e it. To a&s;cend the throne, was to be a robber and an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. The citi|zen knew not thenceforth what he had to fear, to hope, or to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of one place were in|volved in oppo&s;ition and blood&s;hed, and
<PB N="23" REF="013650_0029_0F919BF942BC16A8">cho&s;e of another were engaged in dark con&s;piracies, where women were admitted to the my&s;teries, and &s;ometimes employed as the mini&s;ters of vengeance; for the ills complained of extended to them, and they had often more to lo&s;e than their lives. The two &s;exes then kept pace with each other: their courage was great, becau&s;e the occa&s;ions of exerting it were many and trying.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame periods, and from the &s;ame impul&s;e, both Europe and A&s;ia were over-run by inva&s;ions and emigrations of armed multitudes; and, among all tho&s;e wandering people, the two &s;exes encoun|tered the &s;ame hard&s;hips and the &s;ame perils. The women would therefore im|perceptibly acquire a habit of fortitude; &mdash; and, as the virtue of the &s;ofter &s;ex has its exi&s;tence in pride &mdash; as indolence is almo&s;t always the companion of &s;e|duction &mdash; as the practice of &s;urmounting dangers teaches us to &s;ubdue our&s;elves &mdash; as the life of tho&s;e women was either altogether active, or altogether retired; &mdash; and, as they could know nothing of
<PB N="24" REF="013650_0030_0F919BFB62172C40">that anxious lei&s;ure of &s;ociety, where imagination eternally out-runs de&s;ire, and the &s;oul is at once corrupted by all its &s;en&s;es, they would join to their courage a high and delicate apprehen&s;ion of ho|nour: &mdash; and the&s;e are, indeed, the two qualities a&s;&s;igned by Plutarch to the wo|men of tho&s;e early times, both Greeks and Barbarians.</P>
<P>But, in the different eras of Grecian hi&s;tory, we mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e that the women were always the &s;ame. It appears that the manners in the i&s;les of Greece, in general, were much purer than on the continent. Tho&s;e i&s;landers, by being le&s;s expo&s;ed to foreign intercour&s;e, could more ea&s;ily pre&s;erve their laws and their virtues. The warlike convents of Lace|demon, the nur&s;eries only of &s;oldiers, would be much more rigid than the &s;miling retreats of Athens, whence po|litene&s;s was propagated, and fa&s;hion an|nounced; and the city of Thebes, where a ru&s;tic gro&s;&s;ne&s;s &s;upplied the place of an elegant luxury, mu&s;t have been very dif|ferent from Corinth, which on account
<PB N="25" REF="013650_0031_0F919BFD4B4813A8">of its &s;ituation and commerce, obtained the name of THE TWO SEAS OF WEALTH AND PLEASURE.</P>
<P>In proportion as their In&s;titutions were corrupted, the virtues of the wo|men, we may conclude, were lo&s;t. But the rank which the courtezans enjoyed, even in the brighte&s;t ages of Greece, and particularly at Athens, is one of the greate&s;t &s;ingularities in the manners of any people. By what circum&s;tance could that order of women, who deba&s;e at once their own &s;ex and ours &mdash; in a country where the women were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of mo|de&s;ty, and the men of &s;entiment &mdash; arrive at di&s;tinction, and &s;ometimes even at the highe&s;t degree of reputation and con&s;e|quence? &mdash; Several rea&s;ons may be a&s;|&s;igned for that phenomenon in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In Greece, the courtezans were in &s;ome mea&s;ure connected with the religion of the country. The godde&s;s of Beauty had her altars: and &s;he was &s;uppo&s;ed to protect pro&s;titution, which was to her a &s;pecies of wor&s;hip. The people invoked
<PB N="26" REF="013650_0032_0F919BFE4F206020">Venus in times of danger; and, after a battle, they thought they had done ho|nour to Miltiades and Themi&s;tocles, be|cau&s;e the Lai&s;es and the Glyceras of the age had chanted hymns to their godde&s;s.</P>
<P>The courtezans were likewi&s;e con|nected with religion by means of the arts. Their per&s;ons afforded models for &s;ta|tues, which were afterwards adored in the temples. Phrine &s;erved as a model to Praxiteles for his Venus of Cnidus: and, during the fea&s;ts of Neptune near Elu&s;is, Appelles having &s;een the &s;ame courtezan on the &s;ea-&s;hore, without any other veil than her loo&s;e and flowing hair, was &s;o much &s;truck with her ap|pearance, that he borrowed from it the idea of his Venus ri&s;ing from the waves.</P>
<P>They were therefore connected with &s;tatuary and painting; as they furni&s;hed the practi&s;ers of tho&s;e arts with the means of embelli&s;hing their works.</P>
<P>The greater part of them were &s;killed in mu&s;ic; and, as that art was attended
<PB N="27" REF="013650_0033_0F919C004D3178D0">with higher effects in Greece than it has ever been in any other country, it mu&s;t have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in their hands, an irre|&s;i&s;tible charm.</P>
<P>Every one knows, how enthu&s;ia&s;tic the Greeks were of beauty. They adored it in the temples; they admired it in the principal works of art; they &s;tudied it in the exerci&s;es and the games; they &s;ought to perfect it by their marriages, and they offered rewards to it at the public fe&s;tivals. But virtuous beauty was &s;eldom to be &s;een. The mode&s;t women were confined to their own apartments, and were vi&s;ited only by their hu&s;bands and neare&s;t relations. The courtezans offered them&s;elves every where to view; and their beauty, as might be expected, obtained univer&s;al homage.</P>
<P>Society only can unfold the beauties of the mind: mode&s;t women were excluded from it. The courtezans of Athens by living in public, and conver&s;ing freely with all ranks of people, upon all manner of &s;ubjects, acquired by degrees a know|ledge
<PB N="28" REF="013650_0034_0F919C00C8202788">of hi&s;tory, of philo&s;ophy, of pe|licy, and a ta&s;te in the whole circle of the arts. Their ideas were more exten|&s;ive and various, and their conver&s;ation was more &s;prightly and entertaining, than any thing that was to be found among the virtuous part of the &s;ex. Hence their hou&s;es became the &s;chools of elegance. The poets and the painters went there to catch the fleeting forms of grace, and the changeable features of ridicule; the mu|&s;icians to perfect the delicacy of har|mony; and the philo&s;ophers, to collect tho&s;e particulars of human life which had hitherto e&s;caped their ob&s;ervation. The hou&s;e of A&s;pa&s;ia was the re&s;ort of So|crates and Pericles, as that of Ninon was of St. Evremont and Conde. They ac|quired from tho&s;e fair libertines ta&s;te and politene&s;s, and they gave them in exchange knowledge and reputation.</P>
<P>Greece was governed by eloquent men; and the celebrated courtezans having an influence over tho&s;e orators, mu&s;t have had an influence on public affairs. There was not one, not even
<PB N="29" REF="013650_0035_0F919C01848155E8">the thundering, the inflexible Demo&s;|thenes, &s;o terrible to tyrants, but was &s;ubjected to their &s;way. Of that great ma&s;ter of eloquence it has been &s;aid: <Q>What he had been a whole year in erecting, a woman overturned in a day?</Q> That influence augmented their con&s;equence; and their talent of plea&s;ing increa&s;ed with the occa&s;ions of exerting it.</P>
<P>The laws and the public in&s;titutions, indeed, by authori&s;ing the privacy of women, &s;et a high value on the &s;anctity of the marriage vow. But in Athens, imagination, &s;entiment, luxury, the ta&s;te in arts and plea&s;ures, was oppo&s;ite to the laws. The courtezans therefore may be &s;aid to have come in &s;upport of the manners.</P>
<P>There was no check upon public li|centiou&s;ne&s;s; but private infidelity, which concerned the peace of families, was pu|ni&s;hed as a crime. By a &s;trange, and perhaps unequalled &s;ingularity, the men were corrupted, &mdash; yet the dome&s;tic man|ners were pure. It &s;eems as if the cour|tezans
<PB N="30" REF="013650_0036_0F919C02783CD9C0">had not been con&s;idered to belong to their &s;ex; and, by a convention to which the laws and the manners bended, while other women were e&s;timated merely by their virtues, they were e&s;timated only by their accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, account for the honours which the vota|ries of Venus &s;o often received in Greece. Otherwi&s;e we &s;hould have been at a lo&s;s to conceive, why &s;ix or &s;even writers had ex|erted their talents to celebrate the cour|tezans of Athens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Athenaeus.</NOTE>; why three great painters had uniformly devoted their pen|cils to repre&s;ent them on canva&s;s; and why &s;o many poets had &s;trove to immor|talize them in their ver&s;es. We &s;hould hardly have believed, that &s;o many illu&s;|trious men had courted their &s;ociety; that A&s;pa&s;ia had been con&s;ulted in deli|berations of peace and war; that Phrine had a &s;tatue of gold placed between the &s;tatues of two kings, at Delphos; that, after death, magnificent tombs had been erected to their memory.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. Of the Roman WOMEN.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the Romans, a grave and au&s;tere people, who during five hundred years were unacquainted with the elegancies and the plea&s;ures of life, and who, in the middle of furrows and of fields of battle, were employed in til|lage or in war, the manners of the women were a long time as &s;olemn and &s;evere as tho&s;e of the men, and without the &s;malle&s;t mixture of corruption or of weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The time when the Roman women began to appear in public marks a parti|cular era in hi&s;tory. In the infancy of
<PB N="33" REF="013650_0039_0F919C0544C50220">the city, and even till the conque&s;t of Carthage, &s;hut up in their hou&s;es, where a &s;imple and ru&s;tic virtue paid every thing to in&s;tinct, and nothing to elegance; &s;o nearly allied to barbari&s;m, as only to know what it was to be wives and mo|thers; cha&s;te, without apprehending they could be otherwi&s;e; tender and affec|tionate, before they had learned the meaning of the words; occupied in du|ties, and ignorant that there were other plea&s;ures, they &s;pent their life in retire|ment, in nur&s;ing their children, and in rearing to the republic a race of labourers or of &s;oldiers. Nor were they inatten|tive to the other parts of dome&s;tic oeco|nomy: virtuou&s;ly happy during the night, in the rece&s;s of more important cares, they were employed through the day in working alternately at the loom and at the &s;pindle.</P>
<P>The habits of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Ro|mans, for many ages, were &s;pun by their wives, or by their &s;i&s;ters. Even Augu&s;tus, when lord of the world, remained an example of that ancient &s;implicity.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="013650_0040_0F919C06E002CF18">
The Roman women, during that pe|riod were re&s;pected over the whole earth. Their victorious hu&s;bands revi&s;ited them with tran&s;port, at their return from battle; they laid at their feet the &s;poils of the enemy, and exalted, and endeared them&s;elves in their eyes, by the wounds which they had received for them and for the &s;tate. Tho&s;e warriors often came from impo&s;ing commands upon kings, and, in their own hou&s;es, accounted it an honour to obey. In vain the too rigid laws had made them the arbiters of life and death: more powerful than the laws, the women ruled their judges. In vain the legi&s;lature, fore&s;eeing the wants which exi&s;t only among a corrupt people, per|mitted divorce; the indulgence of the polity was pro&s;cribed by the manners.</P>
<P>Such was the influence of beauty at Rome, before the licentious intercour&s;e of the &s;exes had corrupted both, deba&s;ing the one by the other: and every mean it appears was u&s;ed to prolong the happy period, and pre&s;erve the purity of female manners.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="013650_0041_0F919C07F3F1AF08">
A &s;evere guardian&s;hip, from which no age relieved the unmarried women; the cen&s;ure of the magi&s;trates; the dome&s;tic tribunals; the laws for preventing their luxury, by fixing their dowries; the &s;umptuary laws, for regulating their or|naments; the temples erected to cha&s;tity, and to a godde&s;s who pre&s;ided over the peace of marriages and the reconciliation of &s;pou&s;es; decrees of the &s;enate in fa|vour of women who had been &s;erviceable to the &s;tate; all demon&s;trate the attention which that warlike people paid to the &s;ofter &s;ex, and to their virtues, as long as they had any them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Roman matrons do not &s;eem to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that military courage, which Plutarch has prai&s;ed in certain Greek and Barbarian women. They par|took more of the nature of their &s;ex; or, at lea&s;t, they departed le&s;s from its character. Their fir&s;t quality was de|cency. Every one knows the &s;tory of Cato the cen&s;or, who &s;tabbed a Roman &s;enator for ki&s;&s;ing his own wife, in pre|&s;ence of his daughter.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="013650_0042_0F919C084DBAF420">
To the&s;e au&s;tere manners the Roman women joined an enthu&s;ia&s;tic love of their country, which di&s;covered it&s;elf upon many great occa&s;ions. On the death of Brutus, they all clothed them&s;elves in mourning. In the time of Coriolanus, they &s;aved the city. That incen&s;ed war|rior, who had in&s;ulted the &s;enate and the prie&s;ts, and who was &s;uperior even to the pride of pardoning, could not re&s;i&s;t the tears and the entreaties of the women: They melted his obdurate heart. The &s;enate decreed them public thanks; or|dered the men to give place to them upon all occa&s;ions; made an altar be erected on the &s;pot where the mother had &s;oft|ened her &s;on, and the wife her hu&s;band; &mdash; and the &s;ex were permitted to add ano|ther ornament to their head-dre&s;s.</P>
<P>It is to be wi&s;hed, that our modern la|dies could a&s;&s;ign as good a rea&s;on for the &s;ize of their caps.</P>
<P>The Roman women &s;aved the city a &s;econd time, when be&s;ieged by Brennus. They gave up all their gold as its ran&s;om.
<PB N="37" REF="013650_0043_0F919C09031ABD20">For that in&s;tance of their genero&s;ity, the &s;enate granted them the honour of having funeral orations pronounced from the ro&s;trum, in common with patriots and heroes. &mdash; After the battle of Cannae, when Rome had no other trea&s;ures but the virtues of her citizens, the women &s;acri&s;iced both their gold and their jewels. A new decree rewarded their zeal.</P>
<P>Valerius Maximus, who lived in the reign of Tiberius, and who has left us a book which is a more &s;ingular monu|ment of great virtues than of good ta&s;te, has &s;everal e&s;&s;ays in prai&s;e of the Roman women. But the&s;e are le&s;s panegyrics than detached hi&s;tories, to which he has &s;ometimes given the &s;tyle and the manner of the oration. We have good rea&s;on to think &s;o, &s;ince the celebrated Portia, the daughter of Cato, and the wife of Brutus, is not there forgot; nor that Julia, the wife of Pompey, who died of terror, at &s;eeing the robe of her hu&s;band tinged with his blood; nor that young Ro|man, who, in pri&s;on, &s;upported her fa|ther by her milk; nor &s;everal other
<PB N="38" REF="013650_0044_0F919C0AE891E128">illu&s;trious women, who, during the time of the pro&s;criptions, expo&s;ed their lives to &s;ave their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>The &s;ame writer, in extolling the vir|tues, touches al&s;o on the talents of the Roman women. He informs us that, in the &s;econd triumvirate, the three a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins who governed Rome, thir&s;ting after gold not le&s;s than blood, and having already practi&s;ed every &s;pecies of robbery, and worn out every method of plunder, re|&s;olved to tax the women. They impo&s;ed a heavy contribution upon each of them. The women &s;ought an orator to defend their cau&s;e, but found none: nobody would rea&s;on again&s;t tho&s;e who had the power of life and death. The daughter of the celebrated Horten&s;ius alone appeared: &s;he revived the memory of her father's abilities; and &s;upported with intrepidity her own cau&s;e, and that of her &s;ex. The ruffians blu&s;hed, and revoked their or|ders. Horten&s;ia was conducted home in triumph; and had the honour of having given in one day, an example of courage
<PB N="39" REF="013650_0045_0F919C0B4C747230">to men, a pattern of eloquence to women, and a le&s;&s;on of humanity to tyrants.</P>
<P>But the era of the talents of women at Rome, is to be found under the empe|rors; when &s;ociety was more perfected by opulence, by luxury, by the u&s;e and abu&s;e of the arts, and by commerce. Their retirement was then le&s;s &s;trict; their genius, more active, was more ex|erted; their heart had new wants; the idea of reputation &s;prung up in their minds; their le&s;ure increa&s;ed with the divi&s;ion of employments. They had &s;er|vile offices, which the women of rank left &mdash; if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf &mdash; to the people: they had tho&s;e of a higher cla&s;s, which were &s;oon &s;illed. During upwards of &s;ix hundred years, the virtues had been found &s;ufficient to plea&s;e; they now found it nece&s;&s;ary to call in the ac|compli&s;hments. They were de&s;irous to join admiration to e&s;teem, till they learned to exceed e&s;teem it&s;elf: for, in all coun|tries, in proportion as the love of virtue dimini&s;hes, we find the value of talents to increa&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="013650_0046_0F919C0C0767C468">
A thou&s;and cau&s;es concurred to pro|duce this revolution of manners among the Romans. The va&s;t inequality of ranks; the enormous fortunes of indi|viduals; the ridicule affixed by the im|perial court to moral ideas; all contri|buted to ha&s;ten the period of corruption. Then vice had no curb. The exce&s;&s;ive de&s;ire of &s;hews brought a low and &s;hame|le&s;s freedom into fa&s;hion. Women con|tended with each other, who &s;hould bribe highe&s;t for the embraces of a player. They &s;ixed their hearts and their eyes upon the &s;tage, to devour the movements of a pantomime. A dancer, or a jug|gler, &s;wallowed up the patrimonies, and gave heirs to the de&s;cendants of the Sci|pios and the Emiliu&s;es. Debauchery re|duced fertility. They learned to cheat nature. The art of producing abortions completed the dete&s;table practice. The pa&s;&s;ions, always craving, always gratified; and the women tired of all, cloyed of all, multiplied in Rome the mon&s;ters of A&s;ia: they mutilated their &s;laves, to &s;atisfy the new caprices of an imagination jaded even with plea&s;ure it&s;elf. The vices became
<PB N="41" REF="013650_0047_0F919C0D06BFFB48">more powerful than the laws. It was no longer the &s;tudy of the magi&s;trate to pre|&s;erve the manners, but to puni&s;h crimes; and &s;ometimes their number, and their nature, was &s;o alarming, that it became nece&s;&s;ary for public ju&s;tice to cover her|&s;elf with a veil: becau&s;e there would have been no le&s;s danger than &s;hame in taking notice of all the guilty.</P>
<P>When Septimus Severus mounted the throne, he found three thou&s;and accu|&s;ations of adultery on the roll. He was obliged to lay a&s;ide his plan of refor|mation.</P>
<P>In that age, the rank of the women appears to have been more frequently prai&s;ed than the virtue, and the talents, or accompli&s;hments, than the manners.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the empire, &s;everal funeral orations were pronounced at Rome in honour of women: the ora|tion of Junia, the &s;i&s;ter of Brutus, and the wife of Ca&s;&s;ius; the oration of the Empre&s;s Livia, the mother of Tiberius;
<PB N="42" REF="013650_0048_0F919C0D8403F440">that of Octavia, &s;poken by Augu&s;tus; and that of Poppaea, by Nero. The fir&s;t may be &s;aid to be the eulogy of virtue, &s;till &s;evere and republican. The &s;econd ought to mark the gradation of the man|ners of the women of a common-wealth to their manners in a court, and under monarchical government.</P>
<P>The manners of Livia partook of both periods, and of both governments. She was connected with the republic by a remnant of &s;implicity; and, to u&s;e the words of Tacitus, <Q>by the &s;anctity of her hou&s;e:</Q> She was connected with the monarchy by a boundle&s;s ambition, by a de&s;ire of reputation, by a &s;tudied deceit, by the art of happily employing the al|lurements of her &s;ex &mdash; in &s;hort, by in|trigue and addre&s;s applied by turns to great or to trifling purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The third oration, or that of Octavia, the &s;i&s;ter of Augu&s;tus, the wife of An|thony, and the virtuous and tender rival of Cleopatra, was the eulogy of beauty rendered intere&s;ting by misfortunes, and
<PB N="43" REF="013650_0049_0F919C1066CC8690">mingled with great events, of which &s;he was rather the victim than the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e panegyrics might pa&s;s without reprehen&s;ion; but the eulogy of Poppaea pronounced by an Emperor and ap|plauded by the Romans, was a proof of the la&s;t &s;tage of corruption<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Ann. XVI. 6.</NOTE> It &s;eemed to in&s;inuate, that all the women con|nected with the imperial hou&s;e, or who entered there, had a right to be prai&s;ed in the &s;ame manner after their death. Several of them, while on the throne, were publicly abandoned in their plea|&s;ures; but the apotheo&s;is repaired all. Religion was even le&s;s &s;trict than the manners: it was ea&s;ier to obtain the rank of a godde&s;s, than the character of a virtuous woman.</P>
<P>There were &s;till however &s;ome virtues among the Roman women; but the&s;e were remarkable. The greater part of them owed their birth to Stoici&s;m, which, under the fir&s;t emperors, &s;pread it&s;elf to
<PB N="44" REF="013650_0050_0F919C108CBED140">Rome. Stoici&s;m is to the manners, what republican &s;everity is to government. It revived in &s;ome hou&s;es the ancient vir|tues; but with this difference, that for|merly the Romans may be &s;aid to have &s;ucked in virtue with their milk; it was a kind of habitual in&s;tinct, and the happy effect of example and of laws: now, to re&s;i&s;t the torrent of corruption, it was nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s cultivated manners, firm opinions, and philo&s;ophical re|&s;ources. It was likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to have principles; for cold rea&s;on could not long have held our: it was nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s a certain enthu&s;ia&s;m, which at once animated and &s;upported the &s;oul; which propo&s;ed to it&s;elf a dignity &s;upe|rior to man, that it might elevate him to the height of his powers; which de&s;pi&s;ed plea&s;ure, that it might hate vice; which with&s;tood &s;orrow and compa&s;&s;ion, that it might fortify it&s;elf again&s;t weakne&s;s; which, in &s;hort, in places where guilt was all powerful by authority and by ex|ample, where men were en&s;laved by all things, rendered man independent of all things &mdash; but of moral obligation; and
<PB N="45" REF="013650_0051_0F919C118D048CD0">which, rai&s;ing him above this &s;ublunary &s;cene and all its delu&s;ive joys, made him his own cen&s;or, his preceptor, his con|templator, and his judge.</P>
<P>Such was the doctrine of the Stoics. It was therefore highly nece&s;&s;ary at Rome in this period, as a powerful counterpoi&s;e to an enormous weight; and it produced, indeed, in that city the mo&s;t amazing contra&s;ts: &mdash; the mo&s;t exalted courage was often found by the &s;ide of the mo&s;t de|ba&s;ing cowardice, and the mo&s;t rigid au&s;terity in the neighbourhood of the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that Stoici&s;m never produced &s;uch great effects in Greece as in Rome. As there is &s;ome|thing extravagant in its nature, it per|haps requires extraordinary circum|&s;tances to give it energy. Great wants and great evils are nece&s;&s;ary to create great virtues. Stoici&s;m re&s;embles tho&s;e mechanical powers, which increa&s;e in proportion to their re&s;i&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="013650_0052_0F919C1211A7AF10">
Several illu&s;trious Romans, nur&s;ed in this &s;ect, di&s;played the virtues which it in&s;pired: and the women, more &s;u&s;cep|tible of habits than of principles, and almo&s;t always governed by the manners, which &s;trike them more forcibly, imi|tated the conduct of their hu&s;bands or of their fathers. Portia had given the ex|ample. The daughter of Cato, and the wife of Brutus, &s;he was rai&s;ed to the very &s;ummit of their ideas. In the con&s;piracy again&s;t Cae&s;ar, &s;he &s;hewed her&s;elf worthy to be a&s;&s;ociated with the fir&s;t of human|kind, and tru&s;ted with the fate of em|pires. After the battle of Philippi, &s;he would neither &s;urvive liberty nor Brutus, but died with the bold intrepidity of Cato.</P>
<P>The example of Portia was followed by that Arria, who &s;eeing her hu&s;band he&s;itating, and afraid to die, to encou|rage him, pierced her own brea&s;t, and delivered to him the dagger with a &s;mile<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of Arria's hu&s;band was Petus.

<P>The &s;ame exalted virtues were di&s;|played, though in a different manner, by Agrippina, the wife of Germanicus; who, naturally haughty and &s;en&s;ible,
<PB N="48" REF="013650_0054_0F919C13863E7320">after the death of that great man, buried her&s;elf in retirement in all the bloom of youth; and who, neither bending her &s;tateline&s;s under Tiberius, nor allowing her&s;elf to be corrupted by the manners of her age, as implacable in her hatred to the tyrant as &s;he had been faithful to her hu&s;band, &s;pent her life in lamenting the one and in dete&s;ting the other. Nor &s;hould the celebrated Epinina be forgot, whom Ve&s;pa&s;ion ought to have admired &mdash; but whom he &s;o ba&s;ely put to death.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that not one of tho&s;e extraordinary women had the honour of a funeral oration. But that avails little: their virtues were pre&s;erved by Tacitus. Two lines of that author are of more weight with po&s;terity than all the pane|gyrics that ever were pronounced.</P>
<P>I do not mean to &s;peak of all the cele|brated women of the empire; but Op|pian, Herodian, Philo&s;tratus, and Dion, take notice of a woman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a cha|racter, and a &s;pecies of merit &s;o very dif|ferent from any of tho&s;e that I have had
<PB N="49" REF="013650_0055_0F919C14454F7F40">occa&s;ion to mention, as to claim my par|ticular attention. It is the empre&s;s Julia, the wife of Septimus Severus: born in Syria, and the daughter of a prie&s;t of the Sun, it was predicted, that &s;he &s;hould ri&s;e to &s;overeign dignity. Her character ju&s;tified the prophecy.</P>
<P>Julia, while on the throne, loved, or pretended pa&s;&s;ionately to love letters. Be it ta&s;te, be it a de&s;ire of knowledge, be it a de&s;ire of reputation &mdash; be it all the&s;e, or be it what it may that induced her, &s;he &s;pent her life with philo&s;ophers. Her rank of empre&s;s would not perhaps have been &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue tho&s;e bold &s;pi|rits; but &s;he joined to that the more powerful influences of wit and beauty. The&s;e three kinds of empire rendered le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to her that which con&s;i&s;ts only in art; and which, attentive to their ta&s;tes and their weakne&s;&s;es, governs great minds by little means. It is &s;aid that &s;he was a philo&s;opher. Her philo&s;ophy how|ever did not extend &s;o far as to give cha&s;tity to her manners. Her hu&s;band, who did not love her, valued her under|&s;tanding
<PB N="50" REF="013650_0056_0F919C15450537A0">&s;o much that he con&s;ulted her upon all occa&s;ions. She governed in the &s;ame manner under his &s;on. To con|clude her character, empre&s;s and mini|&s;ter of &s;tate, occupied at the &s;ame time about literature and politics, and ming|ling her plea&s;ures freely with both, having courtiers for her loyers, &s;cholars for her friends, and philo&s;ophers for her coun|&s;ellors, in the middle of a &s;ociety where &s;he reigned and was in&s;tructed, Julia ar|rived at the highe&s;t celebrity; but, as among all her excellencies we find not tho&s;e of her &s;ex, the virtues of a woman, our admiration is lo&s;t in blame. In her lifetime &s;he obtained more prai&s;e than re&s;pect; and po&s;terity, while is has done ju&s;tice to her talents and her accompli&s;h|ments, has agreed to deny her e&s;teem.</P>
<P>After this extraordinary woman, we find Julia Mammaea, of the &s;ame family, and who was likewi&s;e an empre&s;s, or at lea&s;t mother to an emperor. Her merit was to have united genius and valour; but, above all, to have educated for the throne, her &s;on, the young Alexander
<PB N="51" REF="013650_0057_0F919C172DFF2968">Severus, nearly in the &s;ame manner as Fenelon afterwards educated the duke of Burgundy. She made him at once vir|tuous and intelligent.</P>

<P>All the&s;e women received high enco|miums from the writers of their age;&mdash; which have &s;ince &s;erved to &s;well the &s;ize of all the panegyrics of celebrated wo|men.</P>
<P>We have &s;till remaining two panegyrics on empre&s;&s;es: one is the panegyric of Eu&s;ebia, the wife of Con&s;tance. She was the protectre&s;s of Julian. It was &s;he
<PB N="52" REF="013650_0058_0F919C1753E21A68">likewi&s;e who rai&s;ed him to the imperial throne; and, by that &s;ecret charm which wit and beauty have over even tyrants them&s;elves, &s;he often prevented the po|litical cruelties of a prince, who was al|ways ready to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate tho&s;e whom he feared. Julian, who owed to her, life and empire, compo&s;ed her panegyric, His gratitude has not made him eloquent.</P>
<P>The other panegyric is written by Lu|cian: it is in dialogue, and in the form of a portrait. We do not know pre|ci&s;ely whom it is de&s;igned for; but the commentators, who are always in confi|dence of &s;uch &s;ecrets, have not failed to tell us that it is the panegyric of an em|pre&s;s. Be that as it may, we may ven|ture to a affirm, that it is the original of forty or fifty thou&s;and portraits of he|roines or of prince&s;&s;es, which, four hundred years after, had been made in France, in Italy, or in Spain, by the ora|tors, hi&s;torians, poets, and romance|writers of tho&s;e times, who frequently be&s;tow on one woman all the perfections of the &s;ex.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="013650_0059_0F919C18072B3868">
It is the fir&s;t trace which we find among the ancients of that light &s;pirit of gallantry, which is &s;o fa&s;hionable among the moderns; and which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ay|ing to women, with a warm tongue and a cold heart, all that we do not believe, and all that we would have them to be|lieve. This rant, which is the offspring of in&s;en&s;ibility and affectation, and which joins bomba&s;t to fal&s;ehood, owes its birth to Lucian; and mu&s;t have proceeded from the corruption of the manners of the empire, from the levity natural to the Greeks of his time, and from &s;ome peculiarity in his own character. The head may declaim, but the heart only knows how to prai&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Of the Effects of Chri&s;tianity on the Manners of WOMEN.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already &s;een, that the re|volution in the government of Rome, was followed by a change in the manners; but, towards the third century,
<PB N="54" REF="013650_0060_0F919C196295D608">they underwent a new and more remark|able change.</P>
<P>Hitherto the manners of the women had been only founded on morality, and had no connection with religious ideas. The manners had been united to the policy of &s;ome countries; but the laws had traced different lines, according to the different plans of legi&s;lation, for the commencement and termination of the virtues of women.</P>
<P>The dances, and the dre&s;s of the Spar|tan virgins, are well known. According to Monte&s;quieu, Lycurgus had murdered mode&s;ty, and cha&s;tity it&s;elf.</P>
<P>At Rome, women had been &s;een to dance publicly on the &s;tage, without the &s;lighte&s;t veil between their nakedne&s;s and the eyes of the people: and, if Cato re|tired from &s;uch a &s;pectacle, the magi&s;|trates and the prie&s;ts there attended.</P>
<P>The arts of painting and &s;culpture, which chiefly delighted in imitating na|ture
<PB N="55" REF="013650_0061_0F919C198B23D650">&s;imple and unattired, contributed farther to &s;educe the imagination by means of the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy had no fixed principles for women. Sometimes it combated, and would have extingui&s;hed in them, that &s;weet &s;entiment which is at once the &s;afe|guard and the charm of their &s;ex<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;chool of the Cynies, which regarded mode&s;ty as a dangerous allurement, and made it a duty to bani&s;h it from &s;ociety.</NOTE>; &s;ome|times it taught that the tender union, which &s;uppo&s;es a perpetual contract of hearts, was only the tie of a moment, de&s;troyed by the moment that followed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sy&s;t&egrave;me de la Communaut&eacute; des Femmes dans un Etat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Religion it&s;elf was only a kind of &s;a|cred policy, which had rather ceremo|nies than precepts. The ancients ho|noured their gods, as we honour our great men: they offered them incen&s;e, and expected their protection in ex|change. The gods were their guardians, not their legi&s;lators.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="013650_0062_0F919C1A873375C8">
Chri&s;tianity, which now began to &s;pread it&s;elf over the earth, was a legi&s;|lation. It impo&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;evere laws upon women, and upon manners. It &s;trengthened the marriage knot. To the political, it added a &s;acred tie; and, ra|tified between the bench and the altar, placed the matrimonial engagements un|der the juri&s;diction of Heaven.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with regulating the ac|tions, Chri&s;tianity extended its empire even to the thoughts. Above all it com|bated the &s;en&s;es. It waged war even with &s;uch inanimate objects as might be the accomplices of &s;eduction, or were the means of delight. In a word, rou&s;ing vice in her &s;ecret cell, it made her be|come her own tormentor, and condemned all the guilty to blu&s;h, by a forced con|fe&s;&s;ion of their weakne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lation of the Greeks and Ro|mans referred the motive of every action to the political intere&s;t of &s;ociety; but the new and &s;acred legi&s;lation, in&s;piring only contempt for this world, referred all
<PB N="57" REF="013650_0063_0F919C1B20A77B58">things to a future and very different &s;tate of exi&s;tence. Hence &s;prung the idea of an unknown perfection.</P>
<P>The detachment of the &s;en&s;es, the reign of the &s;oul, and an inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;ublime and &s;upernatural &s;omething, which blended it&s;elf with both, became the doctrine of a body of people. Hence the vow of continence, and the con&s;e|cration of celibacy.</P>
<P>Life was a combat. The &s;anctity of the manners threw a veil over nature and over &s;ociety. Beauty was afraid to plea&s;e; valour dropt his &s;pear; the pa&s;|&s;ions were taught to &s;ubmit; and the &s;e|verity of the &s;oul increa&s;ed every day by the &s;acrifices of the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The women, who generally po&s;&s;e&s;s a lively imagination and a warm heart, de|voted them&s;elves to virtues which were as flattering as they were difficult, which were no le&s;s elevated than au&s;tere. It is almo&s;t a matter of indifference to happi|ne&s;s, whether high pa&s;&s;ions are to be gra|tified
<PB N="58" REF="013650_0064_0F919C1BC6D6AFC8">or &s;ubdued. The &s;oul is plea&s;ed with its efforts; and, provided it is ex|erted, it &s;ignifies little though its activity &s;hould be turned again&s;t it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The di&s;ciples of Chri&s;tianity were far|ther taught to love and comfort one an|other, like children of the &s;ame family. In con&s;equence of this doctrine, the more virtuous as much as the more tender &s;ex, converting to pity the &s;en&s;ibility of na|ture, &mdash; the u&s;e and abu&s;e of which religi|on taught them equally to fear, &mdash; devoted their lives to the &s;ervice of indigence and di&s;tre&s;s. Delicacy learned to overcome di&s;gu&s;t; and the tears of beauty were &s;een to flow in the huts of mi&s;ery, and in the cells of di&s;ea&s;e, with the friendly &s;ympa|thy of a &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>The per&s;ecutions which aro&s;e in the empire &s;oon after the introduction of Chri&s;tianity, afforded that religion a new opportunity of di&s;covering its efficacy. To pre&s;erve the faith, it was often nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uffer impri&s;onment, bani&s;hment, and death. Courage then became nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="013650_0065_0F919C1C8DB8D140">
There is a deliberate courage, which is the re&s;ult of rea&s;on, and which is equally bold and calm: It is the courage of philo|&s;ophers and of heroes. There is a courage which &s;prings from the imagination, which is ardent and precipitant; and &s;uch is mo&s;t commonly the courage of martyrs, or the religious courage.</P>
<P>The courage of the Chri&s;tian women was founded upon the noble&s;t motives. Animated by the glorious hope of immor|tality, they embraced flames and gibbets, and offered their delicate and feeble bo|dies to the mo&s;t excruciating tortures.</P>
<P>This revolution in the ideas and in the manners, was followed by another in the writings. Such as made women their &s;ubject, became as au&s;tere and &s;eraphic as they.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the doctors of tho&s;e times, to whom the church has a&s;&s;igned the com|pound title of &s;aints and of orators, com|mend to admiration the Chri&s;tian women. But he who &s;peaks of them with mo&s;t e|loquence,
<PB N="60" REF="013650_0066_0F919C1D4C01F980">and with mo&s;t zeal, is Saint Je|rom; who, born with a &s;oul of fire, &s;pent twenty-four years in writing, in combat|ing, and in conquering him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The manners of this &s;aint were proba|bly more &s;evere than his thoughts. He had a number of illu&s;trious women at Rome among his di&s;ciples. But, though &s;urrounded with beauty, he e&s;caped weak|ne&s;s, without e&s;caping &s;lander; and, fly|ing the world, the women and him&s;elf, he retired to Pale&s;tine; where all which he had quitted pur&s;ued him &s;till, tormen|ted him under the penitential &s;ackcloth, and, in the middle of &s;olitary de&s;erts, re|echoed in his ears the tumult of Rome.</P>
<P>Such was Saint Jerom, the mo&s;t elo|quent panegyri&s;t of the Chri&s;tian women of the fourth century. That warm and pious writer, though generally har&s;h and ob&s;cure, &s;oftens his &s;tyle in a thou&s;and places to prai&s;e the Marcellas, the Paulas, the Eu&s;tochiums, and many other Roman women, who at the Capitol had embra|ced Chri&s;tianity, and &s;tudied in Rome
<PB N="61" REF="013650_0067_0F919C1E328B6078">the language of the Hebrews, to read and under&s;tand the books of Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>When the Roman empire, like &s;ome venerable column, was pu&s;hed from its ba&s;e, and broke in pieces by the myriads of the North, Chri&s;tianity pa&s;&s;ed from the conquered to the conquerors, and al|mo&s;t entirely by the zeal of the women; who, at the &s;ame time, diffu&s;ed the Go&s;|pel, and &s;oftened the manners of &s;avages.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, that the Chri&s;tian wo|men have, in all ages, been more anxi|ous of making pro&s;elites than the men.

<P>It was women who, making the charms of their &s;ex &s;ub&s;ervient to religion &mdash; who, rai&s;ed to thrones by their beauty, drew over their hu&s;bands to their opi|nions, and &s;pread Chri&s;tianity over the greater part of Europe.

<HEAD>SECTION I. Of the Inundation of the Barbarians, and the Effects of Chivalry on the Character and the Manners of WO|MEN.</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY does not afford &s;o &s;in|gular a revolution in policy and manners, as that which followed the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the Roman empire.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="013650_0071_0F919C25E4515148">
It is to the Barbarians who &s;pread conflagration and ruin, who trampled on the monuments of art, and &s;purned the appendages of elegance and plea&s;ure, that we owe the bewitching &s;pirit of gallantry, which, in the&s;e ages of refinement, reigns in the courts of Europe: and that &s;y&s;tem, which has made it a principle of honour among us to con&s;ider the women as &s;o|vereigns, which has partly formed our cu&s;toms, our manners, our policy, and which has &s;o remarkably influenced our writings and our languages&mdash; that &s;y&s;tem, which has exalted the human character by &s;oftening the empire of force, which mingles politene&s;s with the u&s;e of the &s;word, which delights in protecting the weak, and in conferring that importance which nature or fortune have denied, was brought hither from the frozen &s;hores of the Baltic, and from the &s;avage fore&s;ts of the North.</P>
<P>The northern nations in general paid great re&s;pect to women. Continually employed in hunting or in war, they con|de&s;cended only to &s;often their ferocity
<PB N="66" REF="013650_0072_0F919C26DBFE4280">in the pre&s;ence of the fair. Their fore&s;ts were the nur&s;eries of chivalry. Beauty was there the reward of valour. A war|rior, to render him&s;elf worthy of his mi&s;tre&s;s, went in &s;earch of glory and of danger. Jealou&s;y produced challenges. Single combats, in&s;tituted by love, often &s;tained with blood the woods and the bor|ders of the lakes; and the &s;word a&s;cer|tained the rights of Venus as well as of Mars.</P>
<P>Let us not be &s;urpri&s;ed at the&s;e man|ners. Among men who have made few advances in civilization, but who are al|ready united in large bodies, women have naturally, and mu&s;t have, the greate&s;t &s;way. Society is then &s;ufficiently culti|vated to have introduced the ideas of preference and of choice in the con|nexion between the &s;exes, &mdash; which &s;eem to be little regarded, if at all known, among &s;avages: it is too rude to partake of that &s;tate of effeminacy, in which the &s;en&s;es are enfeebled, and the affections worn out by habit. People but little re|moved from barbari&s;m, in the perfection
<PB N="67" REF="013650_0073_0F919C270AEEC078">of their animal powers, and ignorant of all tho&s;e artificial plea&s;ures created by the wants of poli&s;hed life, feel more exqui|&s;itely the plea&s;ures of nature, and the ge|nuine emotions of man. They mingle even with their love a kind of adoration to the female &s;ex.</P>
<P>Several of the northern nations ima|gined, that women could look into futu|rity, and that they had about them an inconceivable &s;omething approaching to divinity. Perhaps that idea was only the effect of the &s;agacity common to the &s;ex: and the advantage which their natural addre&s;s gave them over rough and &s;imple warriors; perhaps al&s;o tho&s;e barbarians, &s;urpri&s;ed at the influence which beauty has over force, were lead to a&s;cribe to &s;upernatural attraction, a charm which they could not comprehend.</P>
<P>A belief, however, that the Deity communicates him&s;elf more readily to women, has at one time or other pre|vailed in every quarter of the earth. Not only the Germans, the Britons, and all
<PB N="68" REF="013650_0074_0F919C27CB83E040">the people of Scandinavia were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it: it was women among the Greeks who delivered the oracles. The re&s;pect which the Romans paid to the Sibyls is well known. The Jews had their pro|phete&s;&s;es. The predictions of the Egyp|tian women obtained much credit at Rome, even under the emperors. And in mo&s;t barbarous nations, all things that have the appearance of being &s;uperna|tural, the my&s;teries of religion, the &s;e|crets of phy&s;ic, and the rites of magic, are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the women.</P>
<P>The barbarians, who over-ran Europe, carried their opinions along with their arms. A revolution, in the manner of living, mu&s;t therefore &s;oon have taken place. The climates of the North re|quired little re&s;erve between the &s;exes; and during the inva&s;ions from that quar|ter, which continued for three or four hundred years, it was common to &s;ee women mixed with warriors. Hence that &s;weet and timid mode&s;ty, which has generally been con&s;idered as e&s;&s;ential to
<PB N="69" REF="013650_0075_0F919C2885C2DA80">beauty, by being unveiled to every eye, cea&s;ed to be regarded as a virtue.</P>
<P>Among the ancients, the retirement of women was a long time a part of the con&s;titution of the &s;tate; becau&s;e the go|vernment and the laws re&s;ted upon the manners. In modern Europe, the bar|barians having every where concerted military e&s;tabli&s;hments, paid little atten|tion to the manners: they re&s;ted all things upon force.</P>
<P>By mingling with a corrupted people, who had all the vices of former pro&s;perity along with tho&s;e of pre&s;ent adver&s;ity, the conquerors were not likely to imbibe more &s;evere ideas. Hence we &s;ee tho&s;e &s;ons of the North, in &s;ofter climates, uniting the vices of re&s;inement to the &s;tateline&s;s of the warrior, and the pride of the barbarian.</P>
<P>They embraced Chri&s;tianity: but it rather modified than changed their cha|racter. It mingled it&s;elf with their cu&s;|toms,
<PB N="70" REF="013650_0076_0F919C296E6E17D8">without altering the genius of the people.</P>
<P>Thus, by degrees, were laid the foun|dations of new manners, which in mo|dern Europe have brought the two &s;exes more on a level, by a&s;&s;igning to the wo|men a kind of &s;overeignty, and a&s;&s;oci|ating love with valour.</P>
<P>Nearly about the time that this revo|lution took place in the We&s;t, a circum|&s;tance pretty remarkable, a religion,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mahometi&s;m.</NOTE> and a people, aro&s;e, that e&s;tabli&s;hed and con&s;ecrated in the Ea&s;t, the dome&s;tic &s;er|vitude of women: &s;o that the &s;ame era which gave birth to the empire of beauty in Europe, doomed the lovely &s;ex to be eternal &s;laves in A&s;ia. Their &s;lavery ex|tended with the arms of the conquering Arabs, and their dominion and the gal|lantry of the North accompanied the vic|tories of the &s;avage, but generous inha|bitants of the pole.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="013650_0077_0F919C2A09991B88">
The reign of chivalry already com|menced, began to advance over Europe. That civil and military in&s;titution took its ri&s;e from a train of circum&s;tances, and the native bent of the new inhabitants. Its true era was the fourteenth century.</P>
<P>Shattered by the fall of the empire, Europe had not yet arrived at any degree of con&s;i&s;tency. After five hundred years, nothing was fixed; nothing, if I may u&s;e the phra&s;e, was moulded together. From the mixture of Chri&s;tianity with the an|cient cu&s;toms of the barbarians, &s;prung a continual di&s;cord in the manners; from the mixture of the rights of the prie&s;t|hood with tho&s;e of the empire, &s;prung a di&s;cord in laws and politics; from the mixture of the rights of &s;overeigns with tho&s;e of the nobility, &s;prung a di&s;cord in government; and, from the mixture of Arabians and Chri&s;tians, &s;prung a di&s;cord in religions. Anarchy and con|fu&s;ion were the re&s;ult of &s;o many con|tra&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="013650_0078_0F919C2BCFDDF360">
Chri&s;tianity, which had now lo&s;t much of its original influence, like a feeble curb, was &s;till &s;ufficient to re&s;train the weak pa&s;&s;ions, but was no longer able to bridle the &s;trong. It produced re|mor&s;e, but could not prevent guilt.</P>
<P>The people of tho&s;e times made pil|grimages, and they pillaged: they ma&s;&s;a|cred, and they afterwards did pennance. Robbery and debauchery were blended with &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>It was in this era that the nobility, idle and warlike, from a &s;entiment of natural equity, and that unea&s;ine&s;s which follows the perpetration of violence&mdash; from the double motive of religion and of heroi&s;m, a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves to ef|fect in a body what government had ne|glected, or but poorly executed. Their object was to combat the Moors in Spain, the Saracens in A&s;ia, the tyrants of the ca&s;tles and &s;trong holds in Germany, and in France; to a&s;&s;ure the &s;afety of travellers, as Hercules and The&s;eus did
<PB N="73" REF="013650_0079_0F919C2DB90346A0">of old; and, above all things, to defend the honour and protect the rights of the feeble &s;ex, again&s;t the too frequent vil|lany and oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong.</P>
<P>A noble &s;pirit of gallantry &s;oon ming|led it&s;elf with that in&s;titution. Every knight, in devoting him&s;elf to danger, li&s;ted him&s;elf under &s;ome lady as his &s;o|vereign. It was for her that he attacked, for her that he defended, for her that he mounted the walls of cities and of ca&s;tles&mdash;and for her honour that he &s;hed his blood.</P>
<P>Europe was only one large field of battle, where warriors clad in armour, and adorned with ribbands and with the cyphers of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, engaged in clo&s;e fight to merit the favour of beauty.</P>
<P>Fidelity was then a&s;&s;ociated with cou|rage, and love was in&s;eparably connected with honour.</P>
<P>The women, proud of their &s;way, and of receiving it from the hands of virtue,
<PB N="74" REF="013650_0080_0F919C2DF95F60C0">became worthy of the great actions of their lovers, and reciprocated pa&s;&s;ions as noble as tho&s;e they in&s;pired. An unge|nerous choice deba&s;ed them. The ten|der &s;entiment was never felt but when united with glory; and the manners breathed an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;omething of pride, heroi&s;m, and tenderne&s;s, which was altogether a&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
<P>Beauty perhaps never exerci&s;ed &s;o &s;weet, or &s;o powerful an empire over the heart. Hence tho&s;e con&s;tant pa&s;&s;ions which our levity cannot comprehend, and which our manners, our little weak|ne&s;&s;es, our perpetual thir&s;t of hopes and de&s;ires, our li&s;tle&s;s anxiety that tor|ments us, and which tires it&s;elf in the pur&s;uit of emotion without plea&s;ure, and of impul&s;e without aim, lead us to re|ject, are turned every day into ridicule on our theatres, in our conver&s;ations, and in our lives.</P>
<P>But it is neverthele&s;s true, that tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, fo&s;tered by years and rou&s;ed by ob&s;tacles, where re&s;pect kept hope at a
<PB N="75" REF="013650_0081_0F919C2F04F24FC8">di&s;tance, where love, fed only by &s;acri|fices, &s;acrificed it&s;elf uncea&s;ingly to ho|nour, reinvigorated the characters and the &s;ouls of the two &s;exes; gave more energy to the one, and more elevation to the other; changed men into heroes, and in&s;pired the women with a pride&mdash;which was by no means hurtful to virtue.</P>
<P>The foregoing account of the origin and progre&s;s of chivalry, &s;eems naturally to ari&s;e out of the hi&s;tory of the times, and is founded upon the authority of the be&s;t early writers. But there are two late writers, of &s;o high, and &s;uch ju&s;tly me|rited reputation, that it would be an in|jury to the public to omit their opinion, and a crime again&s;t genius, to alter their expre&s;&s;ion: they &s;hall therefore &s;peak for them&s;elves, for the women, and for us; &mdash;for their &s;entiments &s;eem only to cor|roborate ours.</P>
<P><Q>The &s;y&s;tem of chivalry, when com|pletely formed,</Q> &s;ays profe&s;&s;or Fergu|&s;on, 'proceeded on a marvellous re&s;pect and veneration to the fair &s;ex, on forms

The formalities of the duel, and a kind of judicial challenge, were known among the ancient Celtic nations of Europe. The Germans, even in their native fore&s;ts, paid a kind of devotion to the female &s;ex. The Chri&s;tian religion enjoined meekne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion to barbarous ages. The&s;e different principles combined to|gether, may have &s;erved as the foun|dation of a &s;y&s;tem, in which courage was directed by religion and love, and the warlike and gentle were united to|gether. When the characters of the hero and the &s;aint were mixed, the mild &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, though of|ten turned into venom by the bigotry of oppo&s;ite parties, though it could not always &s;ubdue the ferocity of the warrior, nor &s;uppre&s;s the admiration of courage and force, may have con|firmed the apprehen&s;ions of men in what was to be held meritorious and &s;plendid in the conduct of their quar|rels.</P>

The feudal e&s;tabli&s;hments, by the high rank to which they elevated cer|tain families, no doubt greatly fa|voured this romantic &s;y&s;tem.

<Q><P>From the prevailing &s;pirit of the times, &s;ays profe&s;&s;or Millar, the art of war became the &s;tudy of every one who was de&s;irous of maintaining the character of a gentleman. The youth were early initiated in the profe&s;&s;ion of arms, and &s;erved a &s;ort of apprentice|&s;hip under per&s;ons of rank and expe|rience.
<PB N="78" REF="013650_0084_0F919C320185F038">The young &s;quire became in reality the &s;ervant of that leader to whom he had attached him&s;elf, and who&s;e virtues were &s;et before him as a model which he propo&s;ed to imitate. He was taught to perform with ea&s;e and dexterity tho&s;e exerci&s;es which were either ornamental or u&s;eful, and at the &s;ame time he endeavoured to ac|quire tho&s;e talents and accompli&s;hments which were thought &s;uitable to his profe&s;&s;ion. He was taught to look upon it as his duty to check the in&s;o|lent, to re&s;train the oppre&s;&s;or, to pro|tect the weak and defencele&s;s; to be|have with frankne&s;s and humanity even to an enemy, with mode&s;ty and polite|ne&s;s to all. According to the pro&s;i|ciency which he had made, he was pro|portionably advanced in rank and cha|racter, and was honoured with now titles and marks of di&s;tinction, till at length he arrived at the dignity of knighthood; a dignity which even the greate&s;t potentates were ambitious of acquiring, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;tin|gui&s;h a per&s;on who had obtained the

<P>The &s;ituation of mankind in tho&s;e periods had al&s;o a manife&s;t tendency to heighten and improve the pa&s;&s;ion be|tween the &s;exes. It was not to be ex|pected that tho&s;e opulent chiefs, who were &s;o often at variance, and who maintained a con&s;tant oppo&s;ition to each other, would allow any &s;ort of familiarity to take place between the members of their re&s;pective families. Retired in their own ca&s;tles, and &s;ur|rounded by their numerous va&s;&s;als, they looked upon their neighbours ei|ther as inferior to them in rank, or as enemies, again&s;t whom they were obliged to be con&s;tantly upon their guard. They behaved to each other with that ceremonious civility which the laws of chivalry required; but at the &s;ame time with that re&s;erve and caution which a regard to their own
<PB N="80" REF="013650_0086_0F919C330CD124A8">&s;afety made it nece&s;&s;ary for them to ob&s;erve. The young knight as he marched to the tournament &s;aw at a di&s;tance the daughter of the chieftan by whom the &s;how was exhibited; and it was even with difficulty that he could obtain acce&s;s to her, in order to de|clare the &s;entiments with which &s;he had in&s;pired him. He was entertained by her relations with that cold re&s;pect which demon&s;trated their unwillingne&s;s to contract an alliance with him. The lady her&s;elf was taught to a&s;&s;ume the pride of her family, and to think that no per&s;on was worthy of her affection who did not po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t exalted rank and character. To have given way to a &s;udden inclination would have di&s;graced her for ever in the opinion of all her kindred; and it was only by a long cour&s;e of attention, and of the mo&s;t re&s;pectful &s;ervice, that the lover could hope for any favour from his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The barbarous &s;tate of the country at that time, and the injuries to which
<PB N="81" REF="013650_0087_0F919C33C450FB00">the inhabitants, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the weaker &s;ex, were frequently expo&s;ed, gave ample &s;cope for the di&s;play of mi|litary talents; and the knight who had nothing to do at home was encouraged to wander from place to place, and from one court to another, in que&s;t of adventures; in which he endeavoured to advance his reputation in arms, and to recommend him&s;elf to the fair, of whom he was enamoured, by fighting with every per&s;on who was &s;o incon&s;i|derate as to di&s;pute her unrivalled beauty, virtue, or per&s;onal accompli&s;h|ments. Thus, while his thoughts were con&s;tantly fixed upon the &s;ame object, and while his imagination, inflamed by ab&s;ence and repeated di&s;appointments, was employed in heightening all tho&s;e charms by which his de&s;ires were con|tinually excited, his pa&s;&s;ion was at length wrought up to the highe&s;t pitch; and uniting with the love of fame, be|came the ruling and governing prin|ciple of his conduct, and gave a parti|cular turn and direction to all his &s;en|timents and opinions.</P>

As there were many per&s;ons in the &s;ame &s;ituation, &s;o they were naturally in&s;pired with &s;imilar &s;entiments. Rivals to one another in military glory, they were often competitors, as Milton ex|pre&s;&s;eth it, 'to win her grace whom all commend;' and the &s;ame emulation which di&s;po&s;ed them to aim at pre|eminence in the one re&s;pect, excited them with no le&s;s eagerne&s;s to di&s;pute the preference in the other. Their di&s;|po&s;itions and manner of thinking be|came fa&s;hionable, and were gradually diffu&s;ed by the force of education and example. To be in love was looked upon as one of the nece&s;&s;ary qualifica|tions of a knight; and he was no le&s;s ambitious of &s;hewing his con&s;tancy and fidelity to his mi&s;tre&s;s, than of di&s;play|ing his military virtues.

<P>The &s;incere and faithful pa&s;&s;ion, the di&s;tant &s;entimental attachment, which commonly occupied the heart of every warrior, and which he profe&s;&s;ed upon all occa&s;ions, was naturally productive of the utmo&s;t purity of manners, and of great re&s;pect and veneration for the female &s;ex.

<P>Such was the &s;pirit of chivalry. It gave birth to an incredible number of performances in honour and in prai&s;e of women.

<P>The diver&s;ity of nations, however, has &s;hewn it&s;elf in the manner of painting the &s;ame objects. Hence the French compo&s;itions have mo&s;t &s;implicity, the Italian mo&s;t depth, the Spani&s;h mo&s;t imagination&mdash;and the rea|&s;on is obvious. The &s;implicity of the French writers proceeded from the uncompounded manners of a people &s;till in a &s;tate of military &s;ubordination, and more ac|cu&s;tomed to fight than to think: the depth of the Ita|lian writers was the effect of more cultivated minds, more intercour&s;e with &s;trangers, more diver&s;ified man|ners, and of a crowd of little political intere&s;ts: the pomp and imagination of the Spani&s;h writers took its ri&s;e from an ancient pride, from the activity of &s;ouls more &s;ublimed by the &s;un, and from the mixture of the Moors and Arabs with the native inhabitants of the country; which la&s;t circum&s;tance mu&s;t have had a prodigious influ|ence upon the manners, upon the Language, and, by the manner of painting objects, upon the manner of &s;eeing them. For, if the genius of a people forms their lan|guage, the characteri&s;tic of language mu&s;t &s;tamp it&s;elf upon genius.</P></NOTE>, were &s;o many monu|ments

<P>In the courts, in the fields of battle or of tournament, every thing breathed of women:&mdash; and the &s;ame ta&s;te prevailed in letters. One did not write, one did not think, but for them. The &s;ame man was often both poet and warrior; he &s;ung to his lyre, and encountered with his lance, by turns, for the beauty that he adored.</P>
<P>The times, and the manners of chi|valry,
<PB N="86" REF="013650_0092_0F919C3BD173B278">by bringing great enterpri&s;es, bold adventures, and I know not what of ex|travagant heroi&s;m into fa&s;hion, in&s;pired the women with the &s;ame ta&s;te. The two &s;exes always imitate each other; their manners and their minds are refined or corrupted, invigorated or di&s;&s;olved together.</P>
<P>The women, in con&s;equence of the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion, were now &s;een in the middle of camps and of armies: they quitted the &s;oft and tender inclinations, and the delicate offices of their own &s;ex, for the courage and the toil&s;ome occupa|tions of ours. During the cru&s;ades, ani|mated by the double enthu&s;ia&s;m of reli|gion and of valour, they often performed the mo&s;t romantic exploits; obtained in|dulgencies on the field of battle, and died with arms in their hands, by the &s;ide of their lovers or of their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>In Europe, the women attacked and defended fortifications; prince&s;&s;es com|manded their armies, and obtained vic|tories. Such was the celebrated Joan de
<PB N="87" REF="013650_0093_0F919C3C0BFCF458">Mountfort, di&s;puting for her duchy of Bretagne, and fighting her&s;elf.

<P>The warlike &s;pirit among the women, con&s;i&s;tent with ages of barbari&s;m, when every thing is impetuous, becau&s;e nothing is fixed, and when all exce&s;s is the exce&s;s of force, continued in Europe upwards of four hundred years, &s;hewing it&s;elf from time to time, and always in the middle of convul&s;ions, or on the eve of great revolutions.</P>
<P>But there were eras and countries in which that &s;pirit appeared with particular
<PB N="88" REF="013650_0094_0F919C3CC88E4AD8">lu&s;tre. Such were the di&s;plays it made in the fifteenth and &s;ixteenth centuries in Hungary, and in the i&s;lands of the Ar|chipelago and the Mediterranean, when they were invaded by the Turks.</P>
<P>Every thing con&s;pired to animate the women of tho&s;e countries with an ex|alted courage:&mdash; the prevailing &s;pirit of the foregoing ages; the terror which the name of the Turks in&s;pired; the &s;till more dreadful apprehen&s;ions of an un|known enemy; the difference of dre&s;s, which has a &s;tronger effect than is com|monly &s;uppo&s;ed on the imagination of a people; the difference of religion, which produced a kind of &s;acred horrour; the &s;triking difference of manners; and, above all, the confinement of the female &s;ex; which, though in the Ea&s;t con&s;i|dered only as a civil and political in&s;titu|tion, pre&s;ented to the women of Europe nothing but the frightful ideas of &s;ervi|tude and of a ma&s;ter&mdash; the groans of ho|nour, the tears of beauty in the embrace of barbari&s;m, and the double tyranny of love and pride!</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="013650_0095_0F919C3D838CDBF8">
The contemplation of the&s;e objects ac|cordingly rou&s;ed in the hearts of the women a re&s;olute courage to defend them&s;elves, nay &s;ometimes even a courage of enthu&s;ia&s;m, which hurled it&s;elf again&s;t the enemy; and that courage was aug|mented, by the promi&s;es of a religion, which offered eternal happine&s;s in ex|change for the &s;ufferings of a moment.</P>
<P>It is not therefore &s;urpri&s;ing, that when three beautiful women of the I&s;le of Cyprus were led pri&s;oners to Selim, to be &s;ecluded in the &s;eraglio, one of them preferring death to &s;uch a condition, conceived the project of &s;etting fire to the magazine; and, after having commu|nicated her de&s;ign to the re&s;t, put it in execution; &mdash; that the year following, a city of Cyprus being be&s;ieged by the Turks, the women ran in crowds, ming|led them&s;elves with the &s;oldiers, and, fighting gallantly in the breach, were the means of &s;aving their country; &mdash; that, under Mahomet II. a girl of the i&s;le of Lemnos, armed with the &s;word and &s;hield of her father, who had fallen in

<P>That era, and the&s;e multiplied exam|ples of courage among the women merit our mo&s;t &s;erious attention: but only to con&s;ider the revolutions of hi&s;tory, to ob|&s;erve, in the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, the de&s;cendants of the illu&s;trious Greeks, after a revolution of fifteen hundred years, became Chri&s;tians, and &s;ubjects of the republic of Venice, defending their cities and their coa&s;ts again&s;t the ravages

<HEAD>SECTION II. Of the Revival of Letters, and the Learn|ing of WOMEN.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE war reigned in Greece, in Hungary, and in the i&s;lands of the Mediterranean, which &s;eemed only &s;o many theatres for the illu&s;trious acti|ons of women, another revolution took place in Italy: &mdash; the revival of arts and
<PB N="92" REF="013650_0098_0F91A472367ACAE8">of letters. That era gave a new direction to the ideas and occupations of the female &s;ex. A general thir&s;t after knowledge turned all the world to the &s;tudy of lan|guages.</P>
<P>There is a time when the &s;ymbols of ideas are taken for ideas them&s;elves. We hope to in&s;truct our&s;elves by learning words, as &s;ome projectors have hoped to enrich them&s;elves by exploring mines. Languages are otherwi&s;e &s;o many chains of enigmas, where ideas are hid, and never could provoke our a&s;&s;iduity. Be|fore the exerci&s;e of thought, we would know the hi&s;tory of the thoughts of o|thers. This proce&s;s is perhaps even ne|ce&s;&s;ary. In the infancy of life, the &s;en&s;es collect the materials of thinking; in the infancy of letters, the mind trea&s;ures up words, to combine them afterwards. In both ca&s;es, it is the memory that gives activity to the re&s;t of the intellectual pow|ers.</P>
<P>As words lead to ideas, the ancient philo&s;ophy revived with the languages.
<PB N="93" REF="013650_0099_0F91A4731D16DE70">Per&s;ons of au&s;tere minds and obtu&s;e feel|ings, tho&s;e who looked upon cold rea&s;on to be right rea&s;on, who &s;et mo&s;t value u|pon a certain logic that re&s;trains, a &s;ub|tilty that divides, and a vague ob&s;curity which exerci&s;es the under&s;tanding, and leaves it the merit of determining for it|&s;elf, and of fixing its ideas, made choice of the philo&s;ophy of Ari&s;totle: But people of &s;en&s;ibility and fancy, tho&s;e who could pardon errors for eloquence, who pre|ferred a &s;ublime and &s;eraphic &s;y&s;tem of metaphy&s;ics to a dry logic, and elegant allu&s;ions to &s;ylogi&s;tic quibbles; tho&s;e, in &s;hort, who had &s;ouls upon which ideas, even chimerically refined, of perfection, of order, and of beauty, made a deep and lively impre&s;&s;ion, devoted them&s;elves to the philo&s;ophy of Plato.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophy of Ari&s;totle occupied the univer&s;ities and the cloi&s;ters; the po|ets, the lovers, the &s;entimental philo&s;oph|ers, and the ladies, were the di&s;ciples of Plato.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="013650_0100_0F91A473B1B2E298">
Theology, or the art of applying hu|man rea&s;onings to cele&s;tial matters, was another kind of knowledge which then employed and engaged the mind: it was fa&s;hionable, and it was nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be &s;o. It was a magazine for the wars of religion, a &s;upport for the court of Rome, and a &s;ure road to honour and preferment. A high value was therefore put on that &s;cience; and the de&s;cendants of the ancient Romans became celebrated by their religious &s;tudies, in the country where their ance&s;tors had been &s;o much renowned by their victories.</P>
<P>After the times of con&s;piracy, of ty|ranny, and of dome&s;tic broils, law and order mu&s;t have been highly prized. Ju|ri&s;prudence was therefore cultivated. They had not &s;ufficient knowledge to be|come legi&s;lators; but they &s;tudied, they explained, they altered, and they disfigur|ed the Roman laws.</P>
<P>Chivalry now began to decline in Eu|rope: but it left behind it a tincture of romantic gallantry in the manners, which
<PB N="95" REF="013650_0101_0F91A476DEE852B0">communicated it&s;elf to the works of ima|gination.</P>
<P>Many ver&s;es were then written, ex|pre&s;&s;ive of pa&s;&s;ions either real or feigned, but always re&s;pectful and tender: and as in France, where the di&s;&s;ipated nobility &s;pent their life in war, love was general|ly painted under the idea of a conque&s;t; in Italy, where another &s;et of ideas pre|vailed, it was always repre&s;ented as an adoration or wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>This confu&s;ion of religion and gallant|ry, of Platoni&s;m and poetry, of the &s;tu|dy of the languages and of the laws, of the ancient philo&s;ophy and the modern theology, formed the general character of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious men of tho&s;e times. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be extended to the mo&s;t celebrated women.</P>
<P>Never were the women &s;o univer&s;ally di&s;tingui&s;hed for profound learning, as in this period. Perhaps as it followed the ages of chivalry, when &s;everal wo|men had di&s;puted with men the prize of
<PB N="96" REF="013650_0102_0F91A477D4D9B908">valour, willing to e&s;tabli&s;h the equality of their &s;ex in all things, they were am|bitious to prove that they had as much genius as courage; and to &s;ubject, even by their talents, tho&s;e over whom they reigned by their beauty.</P>
<P>What &s;trikes us mo&s;t remarkably in that era is, the general &s;pirit. We &s;ee women preach, and unwind controver&s;y; women publicly &s;upport the&s;es; women fill the chairs of philo&s;ophy and of law; women harrangue in Latin before the popes; women write in Greek, and read Hebrew; nuns, poete&s;&s;es; women of qua|lity, divines; and (which happened more than once) young girls perfected in elo|quence, with the &s;weete&s;t features and the &s;ofte&s;t voice, pathetically exhorting the Holy Father and the Chri&s;tian princes to declare war again&s;t the Turks.</P>
<P>The religious &s;pirit which has animated women in all ages &s;howed it&s;elf at this time, but it changed its form. It had made them, by turns, martyrs, apo&s;tles,
<PB N="97" REF="013650_0103_0F91A4783AEE3650">warriors, and concluded with making them divines and &s;cholars.</P>
<P>An incredible value was &s;till &s;et on the &s;tudy of languages. In private families, in the cloi&s;ters, in the courts, and even on the thrones the &s;ame ta&s;te reigned. It was but a poor qualification for a wo|man to read Virgil and Cicero. The mouth of a young Italian, Spani&s;h, or Briti&s;h lady, &s;eemed adorned with a par|ticular grace, when &s;he repeated &s;ome Hebrew phra&s;e, or thundered out &s;ome ver&s;es of Homer.</P>
<P>Poetry, &s;o dear to the imagination, and to &s;u&s;ceptible hearts, was embraced with ardour by the women. It was a new and plea&s;ing exertion of talents, which &s;lattered &s;elf-love, and amu&s;ed the mind. Perhaps too that want which they mu&s;t have experienced, &s;pite of them&s;elves, and even without knowing it, in a &s;ubtile philo&s;ophy, an ab&s;tract theology, and an empty &s;tudy of dialects and of &s;ounds, would make them more &s;en&s;ible to the charms of an art, which
<PB N="98" REF="013650_0104_0F91A4791020E030">continually feeds the imagination with its images, and the heart with its &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>I &s;hall particularize a few of the wo|men, who were mo&s;t celebrated for their learning and talents in that period. It would be ea&s;y to double the li&s;t.</P>
<P>In the thirteenth century, a young lady of Bologna, devoted her&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the Latin language, and of the laws. At the age of twenty-three, &s;he pronounced a funeral oration in Latin in the great church of Bologna; and, to be admired as an orator, &s;he had neither need of indulgence on account of her youth nor of her &s;ex. At the age of twenty-&s;ix &s;he took the degree of a doctor of laws, and began publicly to expound the In&s;titutions of Ju&s;tinian. At the age of thirty, her great reputation rai&s;ed her to a chair, where &s;he taught the law to a prodigious concour&s;e of &s;cholars from all nations. She joined the charms and accompli&s;hments of a woman to all the knowledge of a man. But &s;uch was the
<PB N="99" REF="013650_0105_0F91A479DA085E20">power of her eloquence, that her beauty was only admired when her tongue was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>In the fourteenth century, a like ex|ample was exhibited in that city. In the fifteenth century, the &s;ame prodigy re|newed it&s;elf there a third time:&mdash; and I cannot help here remarking, that even at this day, in the city of Bologna, there is &s;till a learned chair &s;illed with honour by a woman.</P>
<P>At Venice, in the cour&s;e of the four|teenth century, two celebrated women attract our notice, the one (Mode&s;ta di Pozzo di Zorzi) compo&s;ed &s;ucce&s;sfully a great number of pieces in ver&s;e, &s;erious, comic, heroic, and tender; and &s;ome pa&s;torals, which were much admired: The other, (Ca&s;&s;andra Fidele) who was one of the mo&s;t learned women of Italy, wrote equally well the three languages of Homer, Virgil, and Dante, and in ver&s;e as well as in pro&s;e. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the philo&s;ophy of her own, and of the pre|ceding ages; &s;he embelli&s;hed with graces
<PB N="100" REF="013650_0106_0F91A47A71A05498">theology it&s;elf; &s;he &s;upported the&s;es with the greate&s;t lu&s;tre; &s;he gave public lectures at Padua; &s;he joined to her &s;e|rious &s;tudies the elegant arts, particularly mu&s;ic, and &s;oftened her learning &s;till farther by her manners. She received homage from &s;overeign pontiffs and &s;o|vereign princes; and, that &s;he might be &s;ingular in all things, &s;he lived upwards of a century.</P>
<P>At Milan a lady of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Trivulzio, early in life, deli|vered a great number of elegant di&s;|cour&s;es before popes and potentates, in the ancient language of the Romans.</P>
<P>At Verona, in the fifteenth century, I&s;&s;otta Nogarolla, acquired &s;o great a reputation by her eloquence that kings were curious to li&s;ten, and &s;cholars to attend, to hear, and to &s;ee.</P>
<P>At Florence, a nun of the hou&s;e of Strozzi di&s;pelled the languor and indo|lence of the cloi&s;ter by her ta&s;te for let|ters;
<PB N="101" REF="013650_0107_0F91A47DAA36A400">and, in her &s;olitude, was known over Italy, Germany, and France.</P>
<P>At Naples, Sarrochia compo&s;ed a ce|lebrated poem upon Scanderbeg; and, in her life-time, was compared to Boyardo and to Ta&s;&s;o.</P>
<P>At Rome, we find Victoria Colonna, marchione&s;s of Pe&s;caira, who pa&s;&s;ionately loved and &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated letters; and who, left in youth to mourn a great and gallant hu&s;band, &s;pent the re&s;t of her life in &s;tudy, and in &s;orrow, cele|brating in her tender ver&s;es her long lo&s;t hero.</P>
<P>In Spain we &s;ee I&s;abella of Ro&s;era, preach in the great church of Barcelona, come to Rome under Paul III. there con|vert the Jews by her eloquence, and comment upon the learned Scotus, with applau&s;e, before the cardinals and arch|bi&s;hops; &mdash; I&s;abella of Cardoua, who un|der&s;tood the Latin, the Greek, and the Hebrew, and who, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of beauty, reputation, and riches, had &s;till

<P>In France we &s;ee &s;everal women po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the learning of the times, particularly the duche&s;s of Retz, who under Charles IX. was celebrated even in Italy, and who a&s;toni&s;hed the Poli&s;h no|bility when they came to demand the duke of Anjou for their king.

So lovely, and &s;o happy an ex|ample of the truth which &s;he advanced, could not fail to convince.

What has &s;ince been called SOCIETY was not then indeed &s;o much known.

<P>It is but ju&s;t, however, to ob&s;erve, that the vanity of being univer&s;al is pe|culiar to the infancy of letters. In child|hood, all the world over-rate their pow|ers.

<PB N="107" REF="013650_0113_0F91A48697C32CF8">and Portia, Semiramis and Sappho, Athalia and Dido.</P>
<P>Boccace undertook above all things to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the reputation of Dido, in oppo&s;ition to Virgil. The panegyri&s;t proves again&s;t the poet, that the widow of Sichaeus was never unfaithful to his memory.</P>
<P>It is humorous to hear Boccace after|wards, in an eloquent and vigorous &s;e|quel to that treati&s;e, harrangue again&s;t the Chri&s;tian widows who married again. The author of the Decameron cites St. Paul, and explains the text of that Apo&s;tle to a young widow, who excu&s;ed her&s;elf on account of her age for not imitating Dido. This piece, which af|fords &s;o much plea&s;antry, is of a &s;erious ca&s;t; and, what will &s;carcely be credited, the moral of Boccace is &s;evere.</P>
<P>The example being now &s;et, a multi|tude of writers publi&s;hed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pa|negyrical catalogues of the illu&s;trious women of all nations.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="013650_0114_0F91A48731455B88">
Jo&s;eph Betu&s;&s;i, tran&s;lated into Italian the Latin treati&s;e of Boccace; and, in the ardour of his zeal, he enriched it with fifty new articles. Francis Serdo|nati, thinking the work not yet com|plete, collected from hi&s;torians, &s;acred and profane, barbarous and poli&s;hed, the names of all the women of eminence which had been omitted, and added to the catalogue a hundred and twenty pa|negyrics.</P>
<P>But this was not all. Philip de Ber|gamo, an Augu&s;tine monk, publi&s;hed a volume in Latin OF ILLUSTRIOUS Wo|MEN. Another performance on the &s;ame &s;ubject was publi&s;hed by Julius Cae&s;ar Capacio, &s;ecretary to the city of Naples; &mdash; one by Charles Pinto, in Latin, and in ver&s;e; &mdash; one by Ludovico Dome|nichi; &mdash; one by James Philip Thoma&s;&s;ini, bi&s;hop of Venice; &mdash; and one by Bernard Scardioni, a canon of Padua, OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS WOMEN OF PADUA.</P>
<P>Francis Augu&s;tine della Chie&s;a, bi&s;hop of Saluca, wrote a treati&s;e on THE
<PB N="109" REF="013650_0115_0F91A48A51A60548">WOMEN FAMOUS IN LITERATURE; &mdash; Lewis Jacob de St. Charles, a Car|melite, wrote another on THE WOMEN ILLUSTRIOUS BY THEIR WRITINGS; and Alexander Van Denbu&s;che, of the Low Countries, wrote one on THE LEARNED WOMEN.</P>
<P>The celebrated Father le Moine pub|li&s;hed a volume under the title of GALE|RIE DE FEMMES FORTES; and Bran|tome wrote THE LIVES OF ILLUS|TRIOUS WOMEN. But it is to be ob|&s;erved that Brantome, a French knight and a courtier, &s;peaks only of queens and prince&s;&s;es. It is in his writings that we find the panegyric of Catherine of Medicis, and of the famous Joan of Naples. In his prolix &s;tyle, &s;imple and plain, Brantome ju&s;tifies the conduct of the&s;e two queens. He tells us that the &s;econd was without weakne&s;s, and the fir&s;t free of guilt. He ab&s;olves the one of her incontinence, and the murder of her hu&s;band; and the other of the civil wars, and the ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartho|lomew.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="013650_0116_0F91A48C4663C5D0">
After Brantome Hilario da Co&s;ta, a Minim, publi&s;hed two volumes in quarto, each volume con&s;i&s;ting of eight hundred pages, containing, as he tells us, the panegyrics of ALL the women of the fif|teenth and &s;ixteenth centuries, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by their valour, their talents, or their virtues. But the pious eccle&s;ia&s;tic has, in fact, only given us the panegyrics of the CATHOLIC women of that period. He does not &s;ay a word, for example, of queen Elizabeth; but he has made a long and elaborate eulogy on her &s;i&s;ter queen Mary, who began her reign with &s;hedding the blood of the amiable Jane Gray; and who, in the five years which &s;he &s;at on the throne, devoted to the flames on ac|count of religion between &s;ix and &s;even hundred per&s;ons, of all ranks, ages, and &s;exes.</P>
<P>The eulogies of this monki&s;h pane|gyri&s;t amount to a hundred and &s;eventy. No &s;mall number. But all mu&s;t yield to the indefatigable Italian, Peter Paul de Ribera, who publi&s;hed in his own language, a work intituled, <Q>The im|mortal
<PB N="111" REF="013650_0117_0F91A48D585CF428">Triumphs and heroic Enter|pri&s;es of Eight hundred and forty-five women.</Q> It would certainly be diffi|cult to make a more complete collection.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e large compilations dedi|cated to the honour of the whole &s;ex, many of the writers of tho&s;e times, men of ta&s;te and gallantry, addre&s;&s;ed panegy|rics to individuals, to women who were the living ornaments of their age. This practice was mo&s;t common in Italy, where every thing con&s;pired to favour it. The world perhaps had never &s;een, at one time, &s;o many &s;hining prince&s;&s;es as then appeared in that part of Europe. The courts of Naples, of Milan, of Mantua, of Parma, of Florence, and &s;everal others, formed &s;o many &s;chools of ta&s;te, between which reigned an emulation of glory and of talents. The men di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves by their addre&s;s in war, or in love; the women, by their knowledge and accompli&s;hments. Al|mo&s;t every one of the&s;e little courts was the re&s;idence of &s;ome man of high repu|tation in literature.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="013650_0118_0F91A48DF68D87C8">
In a country, however exten&s;ive, which forms only one great kingdom, or &s;tate, men of genius are &s;carce; becau&s;e there is only one capital, one court, and one centre of luminaries. The di&s;tant pro|vinces have neither the &s;ame activity, nor the &s;ame ta&s;te. But in a country like Italy, divided into a number of &s;tates, and where almo&s;t every city is a capital; the mind gathers energy, and expands it&s;elf amazingly. This was certainly one cau&s;e of the &s;uperiority of the Italians to the re&s;t of Europe. What was their misfortune in politics, was their glory in arts and in letters.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e men of wit or genius attached them&s;elves to the celebrated women, the ornaments of the courts where they re|&s;ided. Some of them, e&s;timating human conditions only by the mind, and con|ceiving talents to be equal to all things, had even the boldne&s;s to entertain the warme&s;t pa&s;&s;ions for great prince&s;&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boccace at the court of Naples, and Ta&s;&s;o at the court of Ferr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ra.</NOTE>.

<P>But of all the panegyrics, or collec|tions of panegyrics, in honour of women, in ver&s;e, in pro&s;e, in &s;ermons, or in &s;onnets, the mo&s;t &s;ingular, without ex|ception, is that which was publi&s;hed at Venice, in 1555, under the title of <Q>The Temple of the divine Seigniora Joan of Arragon; erected in honour of her by all the greate&s;t wits, and in all the principal languages of the world.</Q> She was one of the mo&s;t extraordinary women of the &s;ixteenth century; and, married to a prince of the hou&s;e of Co|lonna, was mother to Mark Anthony of Colonna, who &s;ignalized him&s;elf in the battle of Lepanto, again&s;t the Turks.</P>

This ideal temple was erected in con&s;e|quence of a decree pa&s;&s;ed at Venice, in the year 1551, in the academy of the DUBBIOSI. One of the members of that &s;ociety had conceived the notion of &s;uch a deification; but the idea was too happy not to be adopted by the body. They had only one di&s;pute, which divided them much; viz. whether Joan of Ar|ragon &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s alone the honours of the temple, or if they &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate with that divinity the marchione&s;s de Gua&s;t her &s;i&s;ter, and no le&s;s celebrated. But after mature deliberation and many learned arguments on both &s;ides, it ap|peared to the academy, that two divini|ties, two &s;overeigns, and two women would not much love to dwell together; it was therefore re&s;olved, <Q>That the marchione&s;s de Gua&s;t have &s;eparate wor&s;hip; and that Joan of Arragon, her &s;i&s;ter, remain in the &s;ole and ex|clu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her altars.</Q> They next proceeded to the building of the temple; and the Latin, Greek, Italian, French, Spani&s;h, Sclavonic, Polonize, Hungarian, Hebrew, Chaldaic, and many

<HEAD>SECTION IV. The &s;ubject continued.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ame &s;pirit which in that era gave birth to &s;o many panegyrics on wo|men, produced a number of books on the merit of the &s;ex in general. The impor|tant que&s;tion of the equality, or &s;uperi|ority, of the &s;exes was agitated:&mdash;and, during five hundred years, there was a kind of literary combination for a&s;&s;igning the pre-eminence to the women.</P>
<P>At the head of that con&s;piracy was the famous Cornelius Agrippa; who, born at Cologn in 1486, &s;tudied all the &s;ci|ences, embraced all conditions, travelled all countries; who bore arms with di&s;|tinction, and was afterwards divine, doc|tor of law, doctor of phy&s;ic; who com|mented on the Epi&s;tles of St. Paul in
<PB N="116" REF="013650_0122_0F91A4915D485E50">England, gave lectures on the philo&s;o|pher's Stone at Turin, on divinity at Pavia, and practi&s;ed phy&s;ic in Switzer|land; who was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively connected with three or four princes and prince&s;&s;es, and was only the more unfortunate; who bore injuries with courage, and without complaining; who was twice in fetters; who was always wandering, becau&s;e al|ways guided by a warm and weak imagi|nation,&mdash;becau&s;e unfit either to be free or to be a &s;lave; becau&s;e he could neither endure poverty nor dependence; and who, after having excited by turns, or at once, pity, admiration, and hate, died in France in the forty-ninth year of his age, loaded with reputation, and oppre&s;&s;ed with misfortunes.</P>
<P>He had publi&s;hed, in 1509, his trea|ti&s;e <Q>Of the Excellence of Women above the Men.</Q> He had then the misfortune to plea&s;e the famous Margaret of Au&s;tria, who governed the Low Countries. It is a pity that little cir|cum&s;tance &s;hould have mingled it&s;elf with &s;o gallant a cau&s;e. The book is divided
<PB N="117" REF="013650_0123_0F91A491D72504B0">into thirty chapters; and, in each chap|ter, he demon&s;trates the &s;uperiority of the women by theological, phy&s;ical, hi&s;|torical, cabali&s;tical, and moral proofs. He calls to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;cripture and fable, the hi&s;torians, the poets, the civil and canon laws, cites a great deal more than he rea&s;ons, and concludes with pro|te&s;ting, that he had no human motive for writing but a &s;en&s;e of duty; becau&s;e every man who knows the truth holds it in tru&s;t, and con&s;equently &s;ilence would be a crime.</P>
<P>The Italians, on reading that work, mu&s;t have con&s;idered it as a robbery, which had been committed in their terri|tories by a native of Germany. But they &s;oon reimbur&s;ed them&s;elves. Cardinal Pompoeia Colonna, Portio, Lando, Do|menichi, Maggio, Bernado, Spina, and a great many others, all wrote on the perfection of women.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;ingular work on the &s;ub|ject is that of Ru&s;celli. It appeared at Venice in 1552. Ru&s;celli came after all
<PB N="118" REF="013650_0124_0F91A4952DC5F0F8">the re&s;t; and di&s;&s;atisfied, as he &s;ays, with the manner in which they had &s;upported a cau&s;e &s;o evident, he conceived new proofs, &s;o po&s;itive, that henceforth there could not be the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt. After having copied, critici&s;ed, and com|mented upon Agrippa, he throws in &s;ome &s;ublime &s;peculations of his own, and en|deavours to prove, that the contempla|tion of beauty alone can render man happy on earth, and rai&s;e him to the contemplation of the divinity.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;cope of Ru&s;celli's com|po&s;ition. But the effect of his rea&s;oning is de&s;troyed by the con&s;u&s;ed impre&s;&s;ion which is made on the mind of the reader, by the mixture of divinity and Platoni&s;m; by blending through the whole the name of God and of woman; by placing Mo&s;es by the &s;ide of Petrarch and of Dante; and by giving in the &s;ame page, and even in the &s;ame period, quotations from Boccace and from St. Augu&s;tine, from 0 Homer and from St. John.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="013650_0125_0F91A4962CDAAE68">
Nothing, in my opinion, can exhibit a truer picture than this performance does of the &s;pirit of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury, particularly in Italy; where the &s;ame man was or would be, in good earne&s;t, a lover, a devotee, a chri&s;tian, a pagan, a divine, and a philo&s;opher. Perhaps even that extravagant combina|tion of ideas and of characters mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be found in a country, where we often meet with the ruins of a temple of Jupiter in the neighbourhood of a church, a &s;tatue of St. Peter upon a column of Trajan, and a Madona be&s;ide an Apollo.</P>
<P>It appears, that even after Ru&s;celli had written, there were &s;till infidels to per&s;uade, and that the work of conver|&s;ion was not thought complete; for we find a great many future performances publi&s;hed in Italy, in France, and in Spain, on the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In 1593, a celebrated Venetian, al|ready mentioned, MODESTA DI POZZO DI ZORZI, maintained the &s;uperiority of her &s;ex to ours. Her performance had
<PB N="120" REF="013650_0126_0F91A4965191ECC0">great &s;ucce&s;s: and, unfortunately for her, what perhaps added to its celebrity was, that one might commend without jealou&s;y. She died ju&s;t as it was pub|li&s;hed. The men, however, always viewed with plea&s;ure tho&s;e kind of compo&s;itions by women. Pride, which con&s;trues every thing to its own advantage, regarded as &s;o many proofs of its pre-eminence, the very efforts which were made to demon|&s;trate its inferiority.</P>
<P>Lucretia Marinella, another Venetian lady, &s;upported the &s;ame cau&s;e. Her performance is intituled, <Q>The Dignity and Excellence of Women, with the Faults and Imperfections of Men.</Q> The men, at lea&s;t, will not be accu&s;ed of the fault of inju&s;tice to her; for &s;he had all the &s;ucce&s;s which beauty can give to genius.</P>
<P>In 1628, yet another Italian perform|ance appeared upon <Q>The Dignity of Women.</Q> The author of that book was one Chri&s;topher Bronzini. The work is in dialogue, and divided by Days.
<PB N="121" REF="013650_0127_0F91A497043316A8">We may judge by the extent of his plan how rich the &s;ubject appeared to him: his divi&s;ion is twenty-four Days. The eighth Day, in which nothing is treated of but marriage, occupies upwards of two hundred pages. Bronzini, in prai&s;e|ing the women, has a&s;&s;igned them no rank, and has left the di&s;pute of the &s;exes undecided.</P>
<P>But, in 1650, a book appeared, in which the controver&s;y was treated very prettily. The title of the piece was, <Q>Woman better than man; a paradox, by James del Pozzo.</Q> It &s;eems doubt|ful how far the women would be flattered with the word Paradox.</P>
<P>In Spain, in the &s;ixteenth century, John Spino&s;a wrote a dialogue in prai&s;e of women. We may believe that he ex|tolled them with all the imagination of his country, and with all the maje&s;ty of his language.</P>
<P>The French women were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> le&s;s zealous than the Italian to &s;upport the
<PB N="122" REF="013650_0128_0F91A497B67CF598">honour of their &s;ex. Margaret queen of Navarre, and fir&s;t wife to Henry IV. by turns devout and gay, and more ce|lebrated for the &s;prightline&s;s of her wit than the purity of her manners, under|took to prove, in a piece in the form of a letter, <Q>that Woman is much &s;uperior to Man.</Q></P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle de Gournay, who de|&s;erved to be adopted by Montagne, wrote al&s;o upon her &s;ex; but, more mode&s;t, or more timid, &s;he confined her preten&s;ions, and was contented with equality. That mode&s;ty however did not hinder Mary Schurman,&mdash; born at Cologn, and who in her life-time had a prodigious reputa|tion, &mdash; to &s;ay, after &s;he had read M. de Gournay's book in honour of her &s;ex, <Q>I neither would nor dare approve all that is contained in this performance.</Q> Yet, if any woman ever had a right to a&s;pire at the &s;uperiority, it was perhaps that lady. She was a painter, mu&s;ician, engraver, &s;culptor, philo&s;opher, geome|trician, divine, and under&s;tood and &s;poke nine different languages,</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="013650_0129_0F91A4989C68D3C0">
In 1643, a piece appeared at Paris under this title: <Q>The Generous Wo|man; who &s;hews that her Sex is more noble, more patriotic, more brave, more learned, more virtuous, and more oeconomical than that of man.</Q></P>
<P>In 1665, another lady publi&s;hed at Paris a book intituled, <Q>The illu&s;trious Dames; where, by good and &s;trong Rea&s;ons, it is proved, that the Wo|men &s;urpa&s;s the Men.</Q></P>
<P>In 1673, a performance appeared in|tituled, <Q>The Equality of the two Sexes: Di&s;cour&s;es philo&s;ophical and moral, in which are &s;hewn the Im|portance of dive&s;ting our&s;elves of Pre|judices.</Q></P>
<P>In 1675, the Author of the la&s;t-men|tioned piece refuted him&s;elf, in a trea|ti&s;e on <Q>The Excellency of Men, again&s;t the Equality of the Sexes.</Q> But he rea&s;ons feebly, as if afraid of refuting him&s;elf, and overturning his former &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="013650_0130_0F91A49931142DB0">
A lady of Languedoc, in the &s;ame century, was willing to repo&s;&s;e&s;s her&s;elf of the &s;uperiority, and endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h it by GOOD and SURE rea&s;ons. In &s;hort, that opinion, or that contro|ver&s;y, produced a kind of war among writers otherwi&s;e ob&s;cure, and gave birth to Di&s;&s;ertations, to An&s;wers, and to Re|plies, now equally unknown: and it is but ju&s;t to remark, that few of them de|&s;erve to be read, and that the que&s;tion has not been properly treated in any of them. Authority is always &s;ub&s;tituted for argument. Such pedants &s;hould be told, that twenty citations will not make a rea&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. OF THE COMPARATIVE MERIT OF THE TWO SEXES.</HEAD>
<P>TO determine this grand que&s;tion of &s;elf-love and rivalry between the &s;exes, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to examine the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of their organs; the education of which they are ca|pable; the end of nature in forming them; how far it is po&s;&s;ible to correct or to change her purpo&s;e; which would
<PB N="2" REF="013650_0134_0F91A49E83839110">gain, and which would lo&s;e by departing from her; and, in &s;hort, to mark par|ticularly the influence which the dif|ference of duties, of occupations, and of manners, mu&s;t unavoidably have on the genius, on the &s;entiments, and on the character of the two &s;exes.</P>
<P>In comparing the intellectual powers of the &s;exes, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider di&s;tinctly the philo&s;ophical ta|lent, which meditates; the talent of me|mory, which collects; the talent of ima|gination, which creates; the moral and political talent, which governs.</P>
<P>It would further be nece&s;&s;ary to in|quire, to what degree women po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e four kinds of genius: If the na|tural weakne&s;s of their organs, which is the cau&s;e of their beauty; if the in|quietude of their character, which ari&s;es from their imagination; if the multi|tude and the variety of their &s;en&s;ations, which are numbered among their charms, may not deprive them of that vigorous and continued attention which is requi|&s;ite
<PB N="3" REF="013650_0135_0F91A49F40D05BD8">to connect a numerous train of ideas &mdash; an attention, which excludes all other objects, to view and contemplate one; which out of a &s;ingle idea produces a multitude, all chained to the fir&s;t; or which, out of a number of &s;cattered ideas, &s;elects one primitive and va&s;t idea which combines all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This philo&s;ophical &s;pirit is rare, in|deed, even among men; but &s;till there are many great men who have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it&mdash;who have rai&s;ed them&s;elves to the height of nature to become acquainted with her works; who have &s;hewn to the &s;oul the &s;ource of its ideas; who have a&s;&s;igned to rea&s;on its bounds, to motion its laws, and to the univer&s;e its harmony; who have created &s;ciences in creating principles, and who have aggrandi&s;ed the human mind in cultivating their own. If there is no woman found on a level with tho&s;e illu&s;trious men, is it the fault of education, or of nature?</P>
<P>De&s;cartes, abu&s;ed by envious men, but admired by two generous prince&s;&s;es,
<PB N="4" REF="013650_0136_0F91A4A01EB51580">boa&s;ted of the philo&s;ophical talents of women. I am far however from think|ing that his gratitude could lead him into a voluntary error, even in compliment to beauty. He would no doubt find in Elizabeth and in Chri&s;tina a docility which prided it&s;elf in li&s;tening to &s;o great a man, and which &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ociate it|&s;elf with his genius in following the range of his ideas. He might perhaps even find in the compo&s;itions of women per|&s;picuity, order, and method; but did he find that &s;trong di&s;cernment, that depth of intellect, that di&s;&s;idence which characteri&s;es the real philo&s;opher? &mdash; Did he find that cool rea&s;on which, always inqui&s;itive, advances &s;lowly, and remea|&s;ures all its &s;teps?&mdash;Their genius, pene|trating and rapid, flies off, &mdash; and is at re&s;t. They have more &s;allies than ef|forts. What they do not &s;ee at once, they either cannot &s;ee at all, or they di&s;|dain, or they de&s;pair to &s;ee. It is there|fore little wonder they &s;hould want that unremitted a&s;&s;iduity, which alone can pur&s;ue and di&s;cover important truths.</P>

Imagination might &s;eem rather to be their province.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that the imagi|nation of women has in it &s;omething un|accountably &s;ingular and extraordinary. All things &s;trike it; all things paint them&s;elves on it in a lively manner. Their volatile &s;en&s;es embrace every object, and carry off its image. Some unknown powers, &s;ome &s;ecret &s;ympathies enable them rapidly to &s;eize the impre&s;&s;ions. The material world is not &s;ufficient for them: they love to create an ideal world of their own; which they embelli&s;h, and prodigies &mdash; whatever tran&s;cends the ordinary laws of nature, is their cre|ation, and their delight. They enjoy even their terrors. Their feelings are fine, and their fancy always approaches to enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>But it would be nece&s;&s;ary to inquire, how far that fancy, when applied to the arts, can unfold it&s;elf in the talent of creating and of painting: if their imagi|nation
<PB N="6" REF="013650_0138_0F91A4A190E2F7B0">is as vigorous, as it is lively and ver&s;atile; if it does not unavoidably par|take of their occupations, of their plea|&s;ures, of their ta&s;tes, and even of their weakne&s;&s;es. I &s;u&s;pect that their delicate fibres are afraid of &s;trong &s;en&s;ations, which fatigue them, and that they &s;eek the &s;oft, on which they may repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Man, always active, is expo&s;ed to &s;torms. The imagination of the poet enjoys it&s;elf on the ridge of mountains, on the brink of volcanoes, in the middle of ruins, on &s;eas, and on fields of battle; and it is never more &s;u&s;ceptible of vo|luptuous and tender ideas, than after having experienced &s;ome great emotion.</P>
<P>But women, by means of their delicate and &s;edentary life, le&s;s acquainted with the contra&s;t of the gentle and the terrible, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel and to paint le&s;s perfectly, even the agreeable &s;en&s;ations, than tho&s;e who, thrown into oppo&s;ite conditions, pa&s;s rapidly from the one &s;entiment to the other. Perhaps too, from the habit of re&s;igning them&s;elves to
<PB N="7" REF="013650_0139_0F91A4A4DA15B048">the impre&s;&s;ion of the moment, which with them is very &s;trong, their minds mu&s;t be more repleni&s;hed with images than pictures:&mdash;or perhaps their imagi|nation, though lively, may be compared to a mirror, which reflects fairly, mag|nifies, multiplies, di&s;torts, or dimini&s;hes, like their good-humour, their hopes, their fears, their jealou&s;ies, their envies, the forms of all things, but creates no|thing.</P>
<P>Love is without di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;ion which the women feel the &s;tronge&s;t, and which they expre&s;s the be&s;t. They feel the other pa&s;&s;ions more feebly, and by rebound: but love is their own; it is the charm and the bu&s;ine&s;s of their life; it is their &s;oul. They &s;hould therefore know well how to paint it.</P>
<P>But do they know, like the author of Othello, of The Revenge, or of Zara, to expre&s;s the tran&s;ports of a troubled &s;oul, which joins fury to love; which is &s;ometimes impetuous, and &s;ometimes tender; which now is &s;oftened, and now
<PB N="8" REF="013650_0140_0F91A4A6CD835DA8">is rou&s;ed; which &s;heds blood, and which &s;acrifices it&s;elf? Can they paint the&s;e doublings of the human heart, the&s;e &s;torms of emotion and pa&s;&s;ion?&mdash;No: na|ture her&s;elf re&s;trains them. She has given to one of the &s;exes bold de&s;ires, and the right of attack; to the other &s;he has a&s;&s;igned the province of defence, and timid de&s;ires, which attract by re&s;i&s;t|ing. Love in the one &s;ex is a conque&s;t, in the other a &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>It therefore follows, that the women of all countries, and in all ages, mu&s;t have known better how to paint a delicate and tender &s;entiment, than a violent and turbulent pa&s;&s;ion. Obliged, in &s;hort, by their duty, by the re&s;erve of their &s;ex, by the de&s;ire of a certain charm, which is more bewitching than wit, and more at|tractive than beauty, always to conceal a part of their &s;entiments,&mdash;mu&s;t not the&s;e &s;entiments, by being continually con|&s;trained, become weaker by degrees, and have le&s;s energy than tho&s;e of men, who, at all times, bold and extravagant with impunity, give to their pa&s;&s;ions what tome
<PB N="9" REF="013650_0141_0F91A4A7E123A480">they plea&s;e, and which are invigorated by exerci&s;e?</P>
<P>A temporary con&s;traint inflames the pa&s;&s;ions; but a continued con&s;traint cools or extingui&s;hes them.</P>
<P>With regard to the talent of order and memory, which cla&s;&s;es facts, and ideas when nece&s;&s;ary, as it depends a good deal upon method and habit, there &s;eems little rea&s;on why the two &s;exes may not po&s;&s;e&s;s it in an equal degree, Yet it would &s;till be nece&s;&s;ary to examine, if the women would not be deficient in the quantity of materials, which are &s;o e&s;|&s;ential to erudition; if exce&s;&s;ive appli|cation would not more ea&s;ily di&s;gu&s;t them. Is it not true, that their impa|tience and natural de&s;ire of change, which ari&s;e from fleeting and rapid impre&s;&s;ions, prevent them from following for a cour&s;e of years the &s;ame kind of &s;tudy, and con|&s;equently from acquiring profound or exten&s;ive knowledge? We are &s;en&s;ible they have qualities of mind which atone for it. It is not the &s;ame hand which
<PB N="10" REF="013650_0142_0F91A4A835FF1EC0">poli&s;hes the diamond, and which digs the mine.</P>
<P>We come now to a more important object, the moral and political talent; which con&s;i&s;ts in the regulating of our|&s;elves and of others. To compare the advantages and di&s;advantages of the two &s;exes with regard to this object, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the &s;ame talent in &s;ociety, and when applied to govern|ment.</P>
<P>The women in &s;ociety, by being con|tinually upon the look-out, from the double motive of curio&s;ity and of policy, mu&s;t have a perfect knowledge of men. They mu&s;t be able to di&s;entangle all the folds of &s;elf-love; to di&s;cover the &s;ecret weakne&s;&s;es, the fal&s;e mode&s;ties, and the fal&s;e grandeurs; what a man is, and what he would be; the qualities which he &s;hews, even by an effort to conceal them; his e&s;teem marked even in his &s;atires, and by his &s;atires them&s;elves. They mu&s;t know and di&s;tingui&s;h cha|racters: &mdash;the cool pride, which enjoys
<PB N="11" REF="013650_0143_0F91A4A906286698">it&s;elf in &s;tate; the warm and impetuous pride, which is ea&s;ily inflamed; the vain &s;en&s;ibility, the tender &s;en&s;ibility, the &s;en|&s;ibility which is veiled under an appear|ance of indifference; the pretended le|vity, and the levity of the heart; the dif|fidence which proceeds from character, from vice, from misfortune, or from the mind; in &s;hort, all the &s;entiments, and all their &s;hades.</P>
<P>As women &s;et a high value on opi|nion, they mu&s;t reflect much upon what can produce it, de&s;troy it, or confirm it. They mu&s;t know how far one may direct, without appearing to be intere&s;ted; how far one may pre&s;ume upon that art, even after it is known; in what e&s;timation they are held by tho&s;e with whom they live, and to what degree it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;erve them that they may govern them.</P>
<P>In all matters of bu&s;ine&s;s women know the great effects which are produced by little cau&s;es. They have the art of im|po&s;ing upon &s;ome, by &s;eeming to di&s;cover
<PB N="12" REF="013650_0144_0F91A4A9B5378130">to them what they already know; of di|verting others from their purpo&s;e, by confirming their mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;u&s;picions. They know how to captivate by prai&s;es, tho&s;e who merit them; and to rai&s;e a blu&s;h, by be&s;towing them where they are not due.</P>
<P>The&s;e delicate &s;ciences are the leading|&s;trings in which the women conduct the men. Society to them is like a harp&s;i|chord, of which they know the touches: they can divine the &s;ound which every one will produce. But the men, bold and free, &s;upplying addre&s;s by force, con&s;equently having le&s;s call for ob&s;erva|tion, and hurried along be&s;ides by the continual nece&s;&s;ity of acting, can &s;carcely be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that crowd of little no|tices and polite attentions, which are every moment nece&s;&s;ary in the commerce of life: their calculations therefore on &s;ociety mu&s;t be more &s;low, and le&s;s &s;ure, than tho&s;e of women.</P>
<P>It would afterwards be nece&s;&s;ary to compare the genius of the two &s;exes, as applied to government.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="013650_0145_0F91A4AA9A108028">
In &s;ociety men are governed by their pa&s;&s;ions, and the lea&s;t motives often pro|duce the greate&s;t con&s;equences. But, in the government of &s;tates, it is by com|prehen&s;ive views, by the choice of prin|ciples, and, above all, by the di&s;covery and the employment of talents, that &s;uc|ce&s;s can be obtained. Here, in&s;tead of taking advantage of foibles, we mu&s;t fear them; we mu&s;t rai&s;e men above their weakne&s;&s;es, not lead them into them.</P>
<P>The art of governing in &s;ociety may therefore be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in flattering vice and folly with addre&s;s; and the art of admini&s;tration, in combating them with judgment. The knowledge of man|kind required in the two ca&s;es is very dif|ferent: In the one, they mu&s;t be known by their weakne&s;s; in the other, by their &s;trength. The one takes part with fail|ings, for little ends; the other di&s;covers great qualities, which are mingled with tho&s;e very faults. The one, in &s;hort, &s;eeks little blemi&s;hes in great men, and the other, in di&s;&s;ecting great men, mu&s;t often
<PB N="14" REF="013650_0146_0F91A4ADC3307F70">perceive the &s;ame &s;pots: for perfect cha|racters exi&s;t only in Utopia.</P>
<P>Let us now examine, if this kind of genius and ob&s;ervation agrees equally with the character of the two &s;exes. I know that there are women who have reigned, and who &s;till reign with lu&s;tre. Chri&s;tina in Sweden, I&s;abella of Ca&s;tile in Spain, and Elizabeth in England, have merited the e&s;teem of their age, and of po&s;terity. We &s;aw, in the war of 1741, a prince&s;s, whom even her enemies ad|mired, defend the German empire with no le&s;s genius than courage; and we be|hold, at this day, the Ottoman empire &s;haken by a woman. But, in general que&s;tions, we &s;hould beware of taking exceptions for rules; we ought to at|tend only to the ordinary cour&s;e of na|ture.</P>
<P>It therefore becomes nece&s;&s;ary to in|quire, if in &s;ociety the women being le&s;s engaged in action, and in general le&s;s fit for it, can know &s;o well as the other &s;ex, the talents of men, their u&s;e, or their
<PB N="15" REF="013650_0147_0F91A4AE8EF3BE58">extent; if great views, and the applica|tion of great principles, including the habit of &s;eizing at a glance the re&s;ult of things, corre&s;pond not ill with the pro|lixity of their imagination, or at lea&s;t with the arrangement of their ideas. It is character chiefly which governs; it is the vigour of the &s;oul which gives im|pul&s;e to genius, which &s;trengthens and extends political capacity. But this cha|racter is &s;eldom formed but by great com|motions, by great hopes, by great fears, and by the nece&s;&s;ity of being continually engaged in action. Is not then the cha|racter of women in general, better calcu|lated for elegance than for &s;way?&mdash;for attraction than for command?&mdash;Does not their rapid imagination, which often makes &s;entiment precede thought, render them more &s;u&s;ceptible of prejudice or of error in the choice of men?&mdash;Would not one be in danger of abu&s;e, would not one even run the ri&s;k of their di&s;plea|&s;ure, if he &s;hould &s;ay, that in the di&s;tri|bution of their e&s;teem they would &s;et too high a value upon external accompli&s;h|ments; and, in &s;hort, that they would
<PB N="16" REF="013650_0148_0F91A4AF01EECBF8">perhaps be too ea&s;ily led to believe, that an agreeable man was a great man?&mdash;</P>
<P>Yet Elizabeth was not free from this cen&s;ure. The inclinations of her &s;ex &s;tole beneath the cares of the throne, and the grandeur of her character. We are chagrined at certain times, to &s;ee the little weakne&s;&s;es of a woman mingle with the views of a great mind. If Mary queen of Scotland had been le&s;s fair, perhaps her rival had been le&s;s cruel. This ta&s;te for coquetry, as is well known, furni&s;hed Elizabeth with favourites; in the choice of which &s;he judged more like a woman than a &s;overeign. She was al|ways too ready to believe, that the power of plea&s;ing her implied genius.</P>
<P>That &s;o much celebrated queen exer|ci&s;ed over England an almo&s;t arbitrary &s;way; at which perhaps we ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed. Women in general on the throne are more inclined to de&s;poti&s;m, and more impatient of re&s;traint than men. The &s;ex to whom nature has a&s;&s;igned power by giving them &s;trength, have a
<PB N="17" REF="013650_0149_0F91A4AFB60E7488">certain confidence which rai&s;es them in their own eyes; &s;o that they have no need of manife&s;ting to them&s;elves that &s;uperiority of which they are &s;ure. But weakne&s;s, a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;way which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, &s;hakes her &s;ceptre on every &s;ide, to e&s;tabli&s;h her dominion.</P>
<P>Great men are perhaps more carried to that &s;pecies of de&s;poti&s;m which ari&s;es from lofty ideas; and women, above the ordinary cla&s;s, to the de&s;poti&s;m which proceeds from pa&s;&s;ion. The la&s;t is ra|ther a &s;ally of the heart, than the effect of &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>One thing which favours the de&s;po|ti&s;m of female &s;overeigns is, that the men confound the empire of their &s;ex with that of their rank. What we refu&s;e to grandeur, we pay to beauty. But the dominion of women, even when arbi|trary, is &s;eldom cruel. Theirs is rather a de&s;poti&s;m of caprice, than of oppre&s;|&s;ion. The throne it&s;elf cannot cure their
<PB N="18" REF="013650_0150_0F91A4B07564C708">&s;en&s;ibility they carry in their bo&s;oms the counterpoi&s;e of their power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence it follows, that in limited monarchies fe|male &s;overeigns will tend to de&s;poti&s;m from their jea|lou&s;y; and, in ab&s;olute governments, will approach to monarchy by their mildne&s;s. This ob&s;ervation is prov|ed by experience.</NOTE></P>
<P>If, after having compared the talents of the two &s;exes, we &s;hould compare their virtues, we would receive very dif|ferent informations.</P>
<P>Both experience and hi&s;tory atte&s;t, that in all &s;ects, in all countries, and in all ranks, the women have more religious virtues than the men. Naturally po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of more &s;en&s;ibility, they have more need of an object that may uncea&s;ingly occupy their &s;ouls; they offer to God a &s;entiment which they cannot contain, and which otherwi&s;e would be a crime. Greedy of happine&s;s, and not finding enough in this world, they launch into a life and a world abounding with ineffable delights. Extreme in their de&s;ires, no|thing limited can &s;atisfy them.&mdash;More
<PB N="19" REF="013650_0151_0F91A4B26DB11138">flexible in their duties than men, they rea&s;on le&s;s, and feel more. More &s;ub|jected to good opinion, they pay more attention to what concerns them&s;elves. Le&s;s occupied, and le&s;s active, they have more time for contemplation. Le&s;s ab|&s;tracted or ab&s;ent, they are more &s;trongly affected by the &s;ame idea, becau&s;e they &s;ee it continually. More &s;truck by ex|ternal objects, they reli&s;h more the pageantry of ceremonies and of temples; and the devotion of the &s;en&s;es has no in|con&s;iderable effect on that of the &s;oul. Confined, in &s;hort, on all hands, denied the effu&s;ion of their &s;entiments to men by the re&s;erve of their &s;ex, to women by an eternal rivalry, they may at lea&s;t talk of their plea&s;ures and their pains to the great Being who knows them, and they often pour into his bo&s;om many dear weak|ne&s;&s;es of which the world are ignorant. In &s;o doing they recall their beloved er|rors, they enjoy even their &s;orrow, with|out reproaching them&s;elves; and afflict|ed, yet free from remor&s;e, becau&s;e un|der the eye of a benevolent Deity, they
<PB N="20" REF="013650_0152_0F91A4B2B4740638">find &s;ecret delights in repenting, and in combating their warme&s;t wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem therefore, in con&s;e|quence of the character of women, that their religion mu&s;t be more tender, and that of men more &s;evere, the one con|&s;i&s;ting more in practice, the other in principles; and, in exalting their reli|gious ideas, that the woman is more liable to &s;uper&s;tition, the man to fanati|ci&s;m. But, if once fanatici&s;m catch hold of the woman, her more lively imagina|tion will carry her a greater length; and, more au&s;tere even from the dread of &s;en|&s;ibility, what was formerly a part of her charms, will only contribute to increa&s;e her fury.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic virtues are intimately connected with tho&s;e of religion. They are doubtle&s;s common to both &s;exes: but the advantage &s;eems &s;till to be in favour of the women. At lea&s;t they have more need of virtues which they have more occa&s;ion to practice.</P>

In the fir&s;t period of life, timid, and without &s;upport, the girl is more attached to her mother: by &s;eldom leaving her, &s;he comes to love her more. The trem|bling innocent is cheared by the pre&s;ence of her protectre&s;s; and her weakne&s;s, while it heightens her beauty, augments her &s;en&s;ibility. Become mother, &s;he has other duties, which all things invite her to fulfil. Then the condition of the two &s;exes is widely different.</P>
<P>Man, in the middle of his labours, and among his arts, employing his powers, and commanding nature, finds a plea&s;ure in his indu&s;try, in his &s;ucce&s;s, and even in his toils. But woman, more &s;olitary, and le&s;s active, has fewer re&s;ources: her plea&s;ures mu&s;t ari&s;e from her virtues; her amu&s;ements are her family. It is by the cradle of her child&mdash;it is in viewing the &s;miles of her daughter, or the &s;ports of her &s;on, that a mother is happy.</P>
<P>And where are the bowels, the cries, the powerful emotions of nature?&mdash; Where is the &s;entiment, at once &s;ublime

It is &s;he, who by an impul&s;e, as quick as in|voluntary, ru&s;hes into the flood to pre|&s;erve a boy, who&s;e imprudence had be|trayed him to the waves. It is &s;he, who, in the middle of a conflagration, throws her&s;elf acro&s;s the flames to &s;ave a &s;leeping infant. It is &s;he, who with di&s;hevelled locks, pale, di&s;tracted, embraces with tran&s;port the body of a dead child, pre&s;&s;|ing its cold lips to hers, as if &s;he would reanimate by her tears and her care&s;&s;es the in&s;en&s;ible clay.</P>
<P>The&s;e great expre&s;&s;ions of nature, the&s;e heart-rending emotions, which fill us at once with wonder, compa&s;&s;ion, and terror, always have belonged, and always will belong, only to women.

<P>Nature her&s;elf, attentive in this in|&s;tance to the manners of women, has taken care to &s;urround them with the &s;tronge&s;t, yet the gentle&s;t barriers. She
<PB N="24" REF="013650_0156_0F91A4B9778E9478">has made incon&s;tancy more painful, and fidelity more plea&s;ing to their hearts:&mdash; and it mu&s;t be owned, that they have &s;eldom begun the di&s;orders of families. Even in ages of general corruption, con|jugal infidelity in women has been one of the la&s;t of crimes.</P>
<P>After the religious and dome&s;tic vir|tues come the &s;ocial virtues; and fir&s;t the virtues of &s;en&s;ibility, or the &s;weet and affectionate pa&s;&s;ions. The chief of the&s;e are friend&s;hip and love.</P>

<P>Montaigne would not fail to reply,</P>
<Q><P>You judge of women according to nature; judge of them likewi&s;e ac|cording to &s;ociety, as they exi&s;t in the world, and particularly in great cities. Examine if their general de&s;ire to plea&s;e, a &s;entiment more &s;light than
<PB N="27" REF="013650_0159_0F91A4BBDD682AF0">deep, and more vain than tender, has not withered their hearts, and in a great mea&s;ure bla&s;ted &s;en&s;ibility it&s;elf; if, intoxicated with eternal flattery, and accu&s;tomed to the &s;weete&s;t dominion, they could &s;ubmit to continual &s;acri|fices, and to that happy equality which friend&s;hip impo&s;es; if, in &s;hort, in their friend&s;hip with us, they would not have too much re&s;erve: &mdash; and how contemptible is a friend&s;hip which is on its guard, where the &s;entiments are always covered with a &s;lender veil, and where the naked heart is never &s;een!</P>
<P>I &s;peak not of their friend&s;hip be|tween them&s;elves: there was no &s;uch thing known in my time; and, I &s;up|po&s;e it is the &s;ame in yours. But I &s;hould be glad to know how they can love, or repo&s;e confidence in each other, in a world where they are con|tinually compared, and are continually comparing them&s;elves; where their at|tachments divide them; where their preten&s;ions interfere; where they are rivals in rank, in beauty, in fortune,
<PB N="28" REF="013650_0160_0F91A4BC8EBCEB30">in wit, in their talent for &s;ociety, and in their &s;ocieties them&s;elves: for &s;elf|love always calculating, always mea|&s;uring, views all things, is offended at all things, and is fo&s;tered even by what offends it.</P>
<P>No!" &mdash;Montaigne might add, Friend&s;hip does not con&s;i&s;t in empty &s;how, in jargon, in vain phra&s;es, more ridiculous even in their motive than their meaning. It is a &s;entiment which requires energy of &s;oul, and a &s;oli|dity of mind as well as of character; it is a &s;acred and almo&s;t a holy union, which by a devotion peculiar to it&s;elf, con&s;ecrates a heart entirely to a heart; it is a pa&s;&s;ion which transforms two wills into one, and gives to two beings the &s;ame life and the &s;ame &s;oul.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip is bold and &s;evere: for, properly to fulfil its duties, it mu&s;t be able to &s;peak and to hear the har&s;h and ungrateful language of truth. It mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a courage, which is neither alarmed at &s;acrifices nor at dangers:
<PB N="29" REF="013650_0161_0F91A4BD33A2D770">and it demands, above all things, that unity of character which, from the variety and the eternal fluctuation of their pa&s;&s;ions, we &s;eldom find in wo|men, and which only can enable us to feel, to think, and to act as a friend, at all times, and upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>What do I &s;ay? &mdash; Are not friends more &s;trongly a&s;&s;ociated by great in|tere&s;ts, and by great trials? &mdash; But wo|men, by their condition, are de&s;tined to repo&s;e. Nature has formed them, like the flowers, to bloom &s;weetly on the parterre which gives them birth; but the trees, produced and reared in the middle of &s;torms, and in more dan|ger, even from their &s;trength, of being broken by the winds, have more need of &s;upport from each other, and they are &s;u&s;tained by union.</P></Q>
<P>From the&s;e objections, it may per|haps follow, that friend&s;hip in women mu&s;t be more rare than among men; but it will al&s;o be allowed at the &s;ame time, that it mu&s;t be more delicate and more
<PB N="30" REF="013650_0162_0F91A4BDF523C668">tender. Men have in general more of the parade than the elegance of friend|&s;hip. They often wound while they &s;erve; and their warme&s;t &s;entiments are not &s;ufficiently illuminated with tho&s;e little attentions which are of &s;o much va|lue in the intercour&s;e of &s;ouls. But wo|men have a &s;en&s;ibility which is never ab|&s;ent, which never forgets or omits any thing. Nothing e&s;capes them: they di|vine the hidden friend&s;hip; they en|courage the ba&s;hful or timid friend&s;hip, and they offer their &s;weete&s;t con&s;olations to friend&s;hip in di&s;tre&s;s. Furni&s;hed with &s;iner in&s;truments, they treat more deli|cately a wounded heart; they compo&s;e it, and prevent it from feeling its ago|nies: and they know, above all things, to give an importance to circum&s;tances which have none in them&s;elves. We ought therefore perhaps to de&s;ire the friend&s;hip of a man upon great occa&s;ions; but, for general happine&s;s, we mu&s;t pre|fer the friend&s;hip of a woman.</P>
<P>Women in love have the &s;ame delica|cies and the &s;ame weakne&s;&s;es. Their
<PB N="31" REF="013650_0163_0F91A4BEBA4C4160">pa&s;&s;ions are keen: they either love at once, or do not love at all. Men are le&s;s ea&s;ily inflamed, and by degrees. The pa&s;&s;ions of women, by being more con|&s;trained, are perhaps more ardent: they are nur&s;ed by &s;ilence, and rou&s;ed by op|po&s;ition. Fear and mode&s;ty mingle in|quietude with love in their gentle hearts, and by exerci&s;ing it, double its force. &mdash; When a man is &s;ure of his conque&s;t, his pa&s;&s;ion is tinctured with pride; but a woman is then only more tender. The more her confe&s;&s;ion has co&s;t her, the more dearly &s;he loves the man to whom it was made. She attaches her&s;elf by her &s;acrifices. Virtuous, &s;he enjoys her denials; guilty, &s;he glories in the fa|vours &s;he be&s;tows.</P>
<P>Women therefore, when love is a pa&s;|&s;ion, are more con&s;tant than men; but, when it is only an appetite, they are more libertine. For then they feel no more tho&s;e anxieties, tho&s;e &s;truggles, and that &s;weet &s;hame, which impre&s;&s;ed the delicious &s;entiment &s;o &s;trongly on their hearts. Nothing remains but the
<PB N="32" REF="013650_0164_0F91A4C3D904FFB0">&s;en&s;es and imagination: &mdash; &s;en&s;es guided by caprice; an imagination wa&s;ted by its own ardour, and which is every moment inflamed and extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>After love and friend&s;hip come bene|volence, and that generous compa&s;&s;ion which intere&s;ts the heart in the mi&s;&s;or|tunes of others. The&s;e are more parti|cularly the portion of women. Every thing inclines them to genero&s;ity and Their delicate &s;en&s;es revolt at the pre&s;ence of di&s;tre&s;s and pain. Objects of mi&s;ery and aver&s;ion di&s;compo&s;e the &s;oft indolence of their minds. Their &s;ouls are more hurt by images of &s;orrow and of &s;pleen than tormented by their own &s;en&s;ibility. They mu&s;t therefore be very anxious to afford relief. &mdash; They po&s;&s;e&s;s be&s;ides in a high degree, that in&s;tinctive feeling, which operates without rea&s;on|ing; and they often relieve, while men deliberate. Their benevolence is perhaps le&s;s rational, but it is more active. It is al&s;o more attentive, and more tender. What woman has ever been wanting in commi&s;eration to the unfortunate?</P>
<PB N="33" REF="013650_0165_0F91A4C3F89B8420">
<P>But it would be nece&s;&s;ary to examine if women, &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of fried&s;hip, of love, of piety, of benevolence to in|dividuals, can elevate them&s;elves to that patrioti&s;m, or di&s;intere&s;ted love of one's country, which embraces all its citizens, and to that philanthropy, or univer&s;al love of mankind, which embraces all nations.</P>
<P>I would not be thought to undervalue patrioti&s;m. It is the noble&s;t &s;entiment of the human mind; at lea&s;t it is that which has produced the greate&s;t men, and which gave birth to tho&s;e ancient heroes, who&s;e hi&s;tory &s;till a&s;toni&s;hes our imagi|nation, and accu&s;es our weakne&s;s. But if we &s;hould trace its &s;ource, and exa|mine in what it con&s;i&s;ts, we would find that this boa&s;ted virtue is almo&s;t always a compo&s;ition of pride and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, ge|nerated by the ideas of intere&s;t and pro|perty, by the remembrance of pa&s;t &s;er|vices, by the hope of future honours or rewards, and a certain factitious enthu|&s;ia&s;m which robs men of them&s;elves, to
<PB N="34" REF="013650_0166_0F91A4C5E6BF3850">tran&s;form their exi&s;tence entirely into the body of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments, it will readily be perceived, do not corre&s;pond with the condition of women. In almo&s;t all go|vernments, excluded from honours, and from offices, they can neither obtain, nor hope to obtain, nor attach them|&s;elves to the &s;tate, from the pride of having held a place of eminence. Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of little property, and re&s;trained by the laws even in what they have, the form of legi&s;lation in all countries mu&s;t make them in a great mea&s;ure indifferent to public welfare. Never acting or fight|ing for their country, they have not one flattering remembrance to tie them to it, by vanity, by labours, or by virtues. Exi&s;ting, in &s;hort, more in them&s;elves, and in the objects of their &s;en&s;ibility, and being perhaps le&s;s fitted than men by na|ture for the civil in&s;titutions in which they have le&s;s &s;hare, they mu&s;t be le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of that enthu&s;ia&s;m, which makes a man prefer the &s;tate to his fa|mily,
<PB N="35" REF="013650_0167_0F91A4C720643898">and the collective body of his fel|low-citizens to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The example of the women of Rome and Sparta, I am &s;en&s;ible, may be urged in objection to the&s;e ob&s;ervations; but tho&s;e ancient republics are not to be compared with our modern e&s;tabli&s;h|ments. The wonders performed by the Dutch women, in the revolution of the Seven Provinces, will likewi&s;e perhaps be urged. To which I an&s;wer, that the glorious enthu&s;ia&s;m of liberty can do all things; that there are times when nature is a&s;toni&s;hed at her&s;elf; and that great virtues &s;pring from great calamities. But of &s;uch there is no rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>If the love of their country is little &s;uited to women, that univer&s;al love of mankind, which extends to all nations, and to all ages, and which is a kind of ab&s;tract &s;entiment, &s;eems to corre&s;pond &s;till le&s;s with their character. They mu&s;t have an image of what they love. It is only by the power of arranging his ideas, that the philo&s;opher is able to overleap
<PB N="36" REF="013650_0168_0F91A4C7B697D480">&s;o many barriers; to pa&s;s from a man, to a people; from a people, to human kind; from the time in which he lives, to ages yet unborn; and from what he &s;ees, to what he does not &s;ee.</P>
<P>The tender &s;ex do not love to &s;end their &s;ouls &s;o far a-wandering. They a&s;|&s;emble their &s;entiments and their ideas about them, and confine their affections to what intere&s;ts them mo&s;t. Tho&s;e &s;trides of benevolence to women are out of nature. A man to them, is more than a nation; and the hour in which they live, than a thou&s;and ages after death.</P>
<P>There are certain qualities, which have generally been ranked among the &s;ocial virtues, but which may more properly be called THE VIRTUES OF POLISHED LIFE. They are the charm and the bond of company; and are u&s;eful at all times and upon all occa&s;ions. They are in the commerce of the world, what current money is in trade: they are &s;ometimes not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, but
<PB N="37" REF="013650_0169_0F91A4C872E5A5D8">one can never &s;afely be without them; and they always procure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or a more favourable reception. Such is that mild complacency, which gives a &s;oftne&s;s to the character, and an attractive &s;weet|ne&s;s to the manners; that indulgence, which pardons the faults of others, even when it has no need of pardon it&s;elf; the art of not &s;eeing the weakne&s;&s;es which di&s;cover them&s;elves, and of keeping the &s;ecret of tho&s;e who hide it; of conceal|ing our advantages, when we humble our rivals or opponents; of dealing gently with tho&s;e, who cannot &s;ubmit without being offended: that facility, which adopts ideas which it never had; that delicate fore&s;ight, which divines the fears of tho&s;e with whom we conver&s;e, and encourages the di&s;play of thought and &s;entiment; that freedom, which in&s;pires confidence; and all that politene&s;s, in &s;hort, which perhaps is not virtue,&mdash;nay, which is &s;ometimes no more than a happy lie,&mdash;but which gives laws to &s;elf-love, and makes pride &s;it ea&s;y by the &s;ide of pride, which would otherwi&s;e every moment be wounded.</P>

We &s;hall not trace the parallel of the &s;exes through all the&s;e &s;entiments; but it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve in general, that the women correct that rudene&s;s which pride and pa&s;&s;ion introduce into the com|pany of men. Their delicate hand &s;mooths the a&s;perities of human life. Politene&s;s is a part of their character; it is connected with their mind, with their manners, and even with their intere&s;t. To the mo&s;t virtuous woman &s;ociety is a field of conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Few men have formed the project of making every body happy, and &s;o much the wor&s;e for tho&s;e who have: but many women have not only formed &s;uch a &s;cheme, but have &s;ucceeded in it. The more general the intercour&s;e of the &s;exes, the more the talent of plea&s;ing is per|fected; the more general this &s;pecies of merit; for then there are more little in|tere&s;ts to conciliate, and characters to unite.

*We are, in general, &s;o much the more polite, as we are le&s;s devoted to our&s;elves and more to others; as we are more attentive to opinion; as we are more zealous to be di&s;tingui&s;hed; and, perhaps, in proportion as we have fewer re&s;ources and great means of being &s;o. But the&s;e are not all: among individuals and among a people, between the &s;exes and between the ranks, politene&s;s &s;up|po&s;es a certain degree of idlene&s;s; for it &s;uppo&s;es the habit and the nece&s;&s;ity of living together. Hence the art of regu|lating our behaviour, of adju&s;ting our looks, our words, and our motions; the need of attentions, and all the little gra|tifications of vanity. We are naturally inclined to pay that homage which we re|ceive, and to exact that which we pay. Thus the delicacy of &s;elf-love produces all the refinements in &s;ociety; as the de|licacy of the &s;en&s;es produces all the re|finements in plea&s;ure; and as the deli|cacy of ta&s;te, which is perhaps only the re&s;ult of the other two, produces all the refinements in literature, arts, and &s;ci|ences.&mdash;It will be ea&s;y to di&s;cern how
<PB N="40" REF="013650_0172_0F91A4CD56A38070">the&s;e objects are connected with one another, and how they are all related to women.</P>
<P>But refined politene&s;s, it may be &s;aid, is allied to fal&s;hood. It &s;ub&s;titutes the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;entiment too often for &s;entiment it&s;elf. Hence the reproach &s;o common again&s;t women:&mdash;and it mu&s;t be owned, that they are by nature more di&s;po&s;ed to every kind of di&s;&s;imulation than men. Power and independance di&s;|play all their motions with freedom; but weakne&s;s and the art of plea&s;ing, mu&s;t ob|&s;erve and mea&s;ure all theirs. The timid &s;ex therefore learn to hide the &s;entiments which they have, and exhibit tho&s;e which they have not.</P>
<P>A man may be open without being on that account entitled to prai&s;e; for he is often &s;o without effort, nay from an im|petuo&s;ity of &s;oul which he cannot re|&s;train; but &s;incerity in a woman, when real, is never without merit. Men are &s;ometimes frank by de&s;ign: women &s;el|dom affect that &s;pecies of hypocri&s;y; and
<PB N="41" REF="013650_0173_0F91A4CE62915998">when they do, to plea&s;e the better, they give to their frankne&s;s the air of confi|dence. It is a &s;acrifice which they make to friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Men owe their frankne&s;s to pride, women to addre&s;s. The one &s;ex often utters a truth without any other view than truth it&s;elf; in the mouth of the other, even truth it&s;elf has an aim. The fal&s;ity of man almo&s;t always regards his intere&s;t; it is only for him&s;elf: that of woman generally proceeds from a de&s;ire to plea&s;e; &s;he refers every thing to others. The one cheats, the other &s;e|duces you.</P>
<P>Flattery is common to both &s;exes. But the flattery of men is often gro&s;s to a degree that is ba&s;e: that of women is more light, and has more the appearance of &s;entiment. Even when it is over|done, it is generally amu&s;ing, and is ne|ver di&s;gu&s;ting. The motive and the manner &s;ave them from contempt.</P>

To conclude this parallel, (which is already too long) it would be nece&s;&s;ary &s;till to examine the rigid virtues of the two &s;exes which are connected with ju&s;|tice, and the bold and nervous qualities which are allied to courage.</P>
<P>But almo&s;t all the di&s;tinctions, which can be made on the&s;e &s;ubjects, proceed upon the &s;ame principles.

The di&s;tinction of mental and animal courage, is well known: but the&s;e two kinds &s;ubdivide them&s;elves again. In the courage of mind, for example, we find a courage of principle, which de|fies opinion; a courage of will, which gives energy to the &s;oul, and &s;purns con|&s;traint; a courage of con&s;tancy, which &s;upports the idea of toil, and toil it&s;elf; a calm courage, which, in the mo&s;t deli|cate circum&s;tances, views all things deli|berately. In the animal courage, in like manner, we find a courage again&s;t pain, which knows how to &s;uffer; a courage again&s;t danger, whether it con&s;i&s;ts of that hardine&s;s which encounters, or that firmne&s;s which keeps its po&s;t; an habi|tual courage, which is always the &s;ame, and which di&s;covers it&s;elf at all times, and upon all occa&s;ions; and that enthu|&s;ia&s;tic courage, which is a kind of fine fever of the &s;oul, which rages and cea&s;es by fits, and which meets with intrepidity at one time, what it would &s;hrink from at another.</P>

It would not be nece&s;&s;ary to make a particular application of the&s;e, details; the reader's own reflections will be &s;uffi|cient. We ought, however, to ob&s;erve, that the courage which the women po&s;|&s;e&s;s in the highe&s;t degree, is that of &s;up|porting pain; which is no doubt owing to the variety of ills to which they are &s;ubjected by nature.

<HEAD>SECTION VI. Of the Decline of &s;erious Gallantry, and of the Progre&s;s of Society in FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ixteenth century, in which the di&s;pute of the &s;uperiority of the &s;exes was &s;o much agitated, appears to have been the mo&s;t brilliant era in the
<PB N="47" REF="013650_0179_0F91A4D4D200EEB8">annals of women. After that period we find fewer champions, either literary or warlike, enli&s;ted under their banners. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;erious gallantry was &s;omewhat abated. The entire extinction of chivalry in Europe; the abolition of tournaments; the religious wars in Ger|many. and in France, which drew the women of rank to court; and the man|ners which nece&s;&s;arily flow from idlene&s;s, from intrigue, and from beauty being regarded as an in&s;trument of fortune&mdash;in &s;hort the new ta&s;te of &s;ociety which be|gan univer&s;ally to prevail, a ta&s;te which poli&s;hed the manners in corrupting them, and which, by mingling the &s;exes advan|tageou&s;ly, taught them to &s;eek one ano|ther more, but e&s;teem one another le&s;s; &mdash;all contributed to dimini&s;h a &s;enti|ment, which, to gather &s;trength, &s;tands in need of ob&s;tacles, and of a certain &s;tate of the &s;oul in which it is honoured by its de&s;ires, and re&s;pected even from its weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of this revolution, how|ever, was for &s;ome time &s;low in France.
<PB N="48" REF="013650_0180_0F91A4D6BA9C7C70">Under Francis I. who gave the &s;ignal of corruption, we find &s;till in the affairs of love a jealou&s;y, a revenge, a hate, and crimes which prove the manners,</P>
<P>Under Catherine of Medicis, love was a mixture of gallantry and fury. The Italian ardour mingled it&s;elf with the French voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. All was in|trigue. They talked of carnage in the rendezvous of beauty, and meditated in dancing the ruin of nations. In the mean time, the attention to policy and war, the factions, the parties, and a ro|mantic &s;omething which &s;till remained, gave an energy to the &s;oul, which di&s;co|vered it&s;elf even in the &s;entiments which the women in&s;pired.</P>
<P>The reign of Henry IV. di&s;played a milder gallantry. That prince joined the courteous manners of a knight, to the weakne&s;&s;es of a great king. It was thought an honour to imitate him; and his courtiers, bold and brilliant, accu&s;|tomed to glory and to conque&s;t, carried into love a &s;pecies of that noble courage
<PB N="49" REF="013650_0181_0F91A4D7B7252C18">which they had di&s;played in the com|bats of war. They were corrupted, but not deba&s;ed.</P>
<P>Under Lewis XIII. genius, which be|gan to unfold it&s;elf, mingled metaphy&s;ics with gallantry. Every body knows the famous the&s;is which Cardinal Richlieu cau&s;ed to be &s;upported on love. That ludicrous injunction, which &s;ome may &s;uppo&s;e was given in je&s;t, and intended as a burle&s;que on the mi&s;application of learning and talents, was no more than a &s;erious expre&s;&s;ion of the manners of tho&s;e times in France. The religious conte&s;ts had brought controver&s;y into fa|&s;hion. The infant ta&s;te in letters made them take the &s;chola&s;tic forms for &s;cience. A fal&s;e wit &s;prung from a de&s;ire of being witty, and the inability to be &s;o. The gallantry, which mingled it&s;elf with all things, and which di&s;turbed nothing, be|cau&s;e it was not deep&mdash;the gallantry, which was rather a twi&s;t of the fancy than a &s;entiment of the heart, adopted the whole ma&s;s of ab&s;urdities, and formed a jargon equally my&s;tical, metaphy&s;ical,
<PB N="50" REF="013650_0182_0F91A4D845CE9668">and romantic. There was nothing writ|ten or talked of, but di&s;&s;ertations upon the delicacies and the &s;acrifices of love.</P>
<P>Though we generally de&s;cant little up|on what we feel much, yet the&s;e conver|&s;ations and rea&s;onings di&s;covered a turn of mind, which, in permitting gallantry, connected it with tenderne&s;s, and which always joined to the idea of woman the ideas of &s;en&s;ibility and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The regency of Anne of Au&s;tria, and the war of the minority, formed a &s;ingu|lar era. France was a &s;cene of anarchy: but the ta&s;te of the times mingled plea|&s;antry with battles, and ballads with fac|tions. All things then were conducted by women. They had in that period all the re&s;tle&s;s agitation which is communi|cated by the &s;pirit of party; a &s;pirit which is le&s;s foreign to their character than is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed. Some pro|duced the &s;hock, others received it. Every one according to her intere&s;t and her views caballed, wrote, and con&s;pired. Their a&s;&s;emblies were at midnight. A
<PB N="51" REF="013650_0183_0F91A4D901125290">woman in a bed, or on a &s;opha, was the &s;oul of the council. There &s;he deter|mined to negociate, to fight, to embroil or accommodate matters with the court.</P>
<P>Love pre&s;ided at all their con&s;ultations. They con&s;pired to ruin a lover in the affections of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and a mi&s;tre&s;s in the favour of her lover, with as much &s;olemnity as to lay wa&s;te a city, or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;|inate a prince; and not without rea&s;on: for a revolution in love almo&s;t always announced a revolution in politics.</P>
<P>Each woman had her department, and her dominion. Madame de Montbazon, fair and &s;hewy, governed the duke of Beaufort; Madame de Longueville, the duke of Rochefoucault; Madame de Chatillon, Namours and Conde; Ma|demoi&s;elle de Chevreu&s;e, the Coadjutor; Mademoi&s;elle de Saujon, devout and ten|der, the duke of Orleans; and the duche&s;s of Bouillon, her hu&s;band.&mdash;In the mean time Madame de Chevreu&s;e, lively and warm, re&s;igned her&s;elf to her lovers from ta&s;te, and to politics occa&s;ion|ally;
<PB N="52" REF="013650_0184_0F91A4D9B43B1418">and the Prince&s;s Palatine, in turns the friend and the enemy of the great Conde, by means of her genius more than by her beauty, &s;ubjected all whom &s;he de&s;ired to plea&s;e, and whom &s;he had ei|ther a whim or an intere&s;t to per&s;uade. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at once a pa&s;&s;ionate heart and a &s;ound head; and &s;he was no le&s;s romantic in love, than politic in the af|fairs of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Women often appeared publicly at the head of factions, in camps, and in councils of war. Then, to the orna|ments of equipage and dre&s;s, they joined the en&s;igns of their party. At &s;uch a &s;ight one mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf tran&s;ported to the regions of romance, or carried back to the times of ancient chi|valry. On the field, and in the fortre&s;s, in&s;truments of mu&s;ic were mingled with in&s;truments of war; curia&s;&s;es with vio|lins; lutes with &s;pears; and the poli&s;h|ed features of beauty bloomed by the &s;ide of the war-worn &s;oldier.</P>
<P>Devotion, among the women, blended
<PB N="53" REF="013650_0185_0F91A4DBA1E3A4D8">it&s;elf with the &s;pirit of faction, as the &s;pirit of faction did with gallantry. They plotted one hour and prayed the next. So many women of rank never became Carmelites, as at this time. It &s;eemed as if the &s;oul, rou&s;ed by violent commo|tions, applied it&s;elf to all things with greater impetuo&s;ity; and that imagina|tion, inflamed by &s;o much exerci&s;e, ru&s;h|ed with equal rapidity to war, to love, to religion, and to rebellion.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of gallantry, during the re|gency, had nearly the &s;ame character, and the &s;ame &s;ymptoms, as under Louis XIII. except that the civil war, and that extravagance which great commotions give to the &s;oul, warmed the little tincture of chivalry which &s;till remained in the cup of love.</P>
<P>Anne of Au&s;tria had brought to the court of France, a part of the manners of her country. It was a mixture of co|quetry and pride, of &s;en&s;ibility and re|&s;erve; that is to &s;ay, a remnant of the ancient and &s;hining gallantry of the
<PB N="54" REF="013650_0186_0F91A4DBF6EAE238">Moors, joined to the pomp and the &s;tate|line&s;s of the Ca&s;tillians. Then dances, romances, plays, intrigues, all were Spa|ni&s;h. Di&s;gui&s;es and nocturnal &s;cenes be|came the fa&s;hion: but the French viva|city &s;ub&s;tituted the violin in place of the langui&s;hing guitar. That polite and loyal people, affected pa&s;&s;ions which they had not, and counted it an honour publicly to gibbet tho&s;e which they had. A &s;acred homage to beauty, was numbered among the duties of men. Every thing that re|lated to women was viewed with an eye of importance: the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable trifles had a value; and a pre&s;ent of a bracelet, or a complimentary card, made an event in life. They talked as &s;eriou&s;ly of an affair of gallantry, as of the pro|gre&s;s of a negociation, or the i&s;&s;ue of a battle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The ver&s;es of the duke of Rochefoucault to Ma|dame de Longueville, are well-known.</P>

It was this &s;pirit which formed the character of the fir&s;t romances of the age of Lewis XIV:&mdash;eternal romances, be|cau&s;e the writers &s;uppo&s;ed that all pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be durable; &s;erious, becau&s;e they con&s;idered love as an important concern in life; full of adventures, becau&s;e they imagined it mu&s;t turn the brain; full of conver&s;ations, becau&s;e they made it a &s;cience, which had its principles and forms; heroic, above all things, be|cau&s;e it mu&s;t throw the greate&s;t men at the feet of the women, and becau&s;e they then believed that true pa&s;&s;ion is in&s;epara|ble from honour, and will elevate it&s;elf to its object, in place of &s;eeking to de|ba&s;e it.</P>
<P>It was that &s;pirit likewi&s;e which form|ed the French theatre; and which made the great Corneille him&s;elf blend love with the intere&s;t of &s;tates, with ma&s;&s;acre, con&s;piracy, and parricide.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="013650_0188_0F91A4E03ACD8720">
It was the &s;ame general &s;pirit perhaps, which, reigning during the infancy of Lewis XIV. obtained to that monarch among the women the character of being at once great and tender; by which, when young, and pa&s;&s;ionately in love, he would have placed one of his &s;ubjects up|on the throne, and was afterwards able to conquer his weakne&s;s; by which he con|ceived a pa&s;&s;ion, not le&s;s warm, for Hen|rietta of England, yet curbed its violence; by which, always a king, though always a lover, he from his youth knew to pre|&s;erve dignity in his plea&s;ures. But, though he covered &s;en&s;uality with decen|cy, the manners of the women, by a con|currence of circum&s;tances, mu&s;t have been much altered under his reign.</P>
<P>Hitherto the vices of the court had not been tho&s;e of the nation. The different orders of the &s;tate were more &s;eparated. The nobility &s;till retained a remnant of that feudal grandeur, which had made them at once, the formidable rivals of the prince, and the imperious tyrants of the people. The greater their power,
<PB N="57" REF="013650_0189_0F91A4E14A6A8100">the greater the di&s;tinction of ranks. Fa|mily pride kept even wealth at a di&s;tance. Vanity had not yet given the &s;ignal of union. The crown, no longer jealous, removed its barriers; but the nobility multiplied theirs, to &s;eparate them&s;elves more completely from tho&s;e who might have the in&s;olence to pretend to equality.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e times, licentiou&s;ne&s;s and free|dom of manners were almo&s;t always re|garded as the privilege of rank. The vices of the great were even a part of the oppre&s;&s;ion of the common people: we are &s;eldom inclined to imitate tho&s;e whom we hate. The manners of the court therefore could only be communicated to the chief magi&s;trates, and to the rich. But the magi&s;trates were &s;ecure in their au&s;terity: living in the &s;tudy, and in the exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice, they a&s;toni&s;hed the court, and di&s;dained its vices. With re|gard to the people of wealth, few were really wealthy; the &s;hameful, or the re|cent acqui&s;ition of certain fortunes, did not permit the familiarity of pride with tho&s;e who were; and luxury, which only
<PB N="58" REF="013650_0190_0F91A4E1F7B26C40">can place the rich on a level with the great, was by no means general. The nobility had not yet need of trading with their names; and the traders had &s;till le&s;s thought of purcha&s;ing titles.</P>
<P>As people of bu&s;ine&s;s and commerce were then much occupied in their re&s;pec|tive employments, they had little time to lo&s;e; and, con&s;equently, little knowledge of &s;ociety. The manners of all who did not belong to the court were very unpoli&s;hed; and that &s;pecies of ancient ru&s;ticity was the greater bar to coalition, becau&s;e it was an object of ridicule among the courtiers. The contra&s;t of behaviour marked the limits of pride: the line was too &s;trongly drawn to be mi&s;taken; and neither party was willing to cro&s;s it.</P>
<P>Between the capital and the provinces there were not fewer barriers than be|tween the ranks in life. The in&s;ecurity of travelling, the &s;carcity of great roads, of carriages; and, above all, the ab|&s;ence of luxury and factitious wants; and, of cour&s;e, the ab&s;ence in a great
<PB N="59" REF="013650_0191_0F91A4E2B0BB5780">mea&s;ure of that re&s;tle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation which hurries the pre&s;ent inhabitants from place to place, and which makes them run in crowds to the capital in que&s;t of gold, of &s;lavery, and of vice; by retaining eve|ry one under the roof of his fathers, con|tributed to pre&s;erve the manners of the nation.</P>
<P>But, under Lewis XIV. all things changed. The people of the court, hav|ing only titles without power, and being reduced from a real to an imaginary gran|deur, mingled more freely in general &s;o|ciety, and with the people of the city. The inequality of fortunes increa&s;ed with the inequality of taxes. More value was &s;et upon wealth. The great had more wants, the rich had more &s;tate; the poor, corrupted by their de&s;ires, had le&s;s virtue: all ranks approximated.</P>
<P>The magni&s;icence and luxury of the prince fo&s;tered the&s;e ideas. His courtiers, involved in debt by their loyalty, and ruined by their pride, &s;oon came to care&s;s tho&s;e whom they de&s;pi&s;ed. To pre&s;erve
<PB N="60" REF="013650_0192_0F91A4E3A6CB84C0">their titles, it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hare them with families of inferior condition. Gold, extorted from the poor, became the me|diator between the rich and the great. The magi&s;tracy it&s;elf was metamorpho&s;ed. All who re&s;orted to Ver&s;ailles partook of its manners. The difference of accent was lo&s;t in the poli&s;h of &s;ociety. The ru&s;t of ancient manners di&s;appeared. All orders of men mingled.</P>
<P>The provinces were de&s;erted. The mi&s;ery of the country, the luxury of the city; the ambition, the amours, the re|putation of the prince, and his conque&s;ts; the romantic fea&s;ts of his court; the plea&s;ures even of the mind drew every body to the capital. They went there in crowds; quitted there prejudices, blu&s;h|ed for their manners, and at once poli&s;h|ed, enriched, and corrupted them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee what influence all the&s;e changes, and this univer&s;al intercour&s;e mu&s;t have had upon the women. Gal|lantry became the fa&s;hion, and freedom of manners a grace. Every body imitated
<PB N="61" REF="013650_0193_0F91A4E6DD5907F0">the court; and, from one end of the kingdom to the other, the vices circulat|ed with the accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>Another revolution accompanied that of the manners.</P>
<P>In a country where &s;ociety and letters begin to be cultivated, a ta&s;te for litera|ture mu&s;t prevail among the women. But, as that ta&s;te is &s;lowly formed; be|cau&s;e the delicate feeling which di&s;covers the natural and the graceful, and which enables us to paint them with truth, is ac|quired by habit; as we are apt to think that mu&s;t be admired which has co&s;t us much trouble, and that it mu&s;t be the more &s;o the le&s;s it re&s;embles any other compo&s;ition; as what is fal&s;e often ap|pears fine, becau&s;e it pre&s;ents a new co|louring, and &s;hades part of the object to make the re&s;t &s;pring out; as, in &s;hort, whatever is the prevailing humour is car|ried to extravagance, wit mu&s;t at fir&s;t be mi&s;taken for genius; &mdash; the women, who attempted to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, in|vented expre&s;&s;ions which were much ad|mired,
<PB N="62" REF="013650_0194_0F91A4E7F0F5C0A0">becau&s;e they were little under|&s;tood. They made u&s;e of &s;ingular words, when they were at a lo&s;s for ideas; and, to avoid being common, they became ri|diculous.</P>
<P>Every thing contributed to this de|lirium: &mdash; the Italian and Spani&s;h books, which were &s;till much in vogue; the ro|mances of Mademoi&s;elle Scudery; the real admiration of what they called the PRECIEUSES; the conver&s;ations of the hotel de Rambouillet; in &s;hort, the &s;o|ciety and the impo&s;ing name of Madame de Longueville; who, after being in the &s;weep and at the head of factions, old, and without lovers, as without cabal, amu&s;ed her&s;elf in writing metaphy&s;ically upon love, and logically upon wit; and who ta&s;tele&s;sly preferred Voiture to Cor|neille.</P>
<P>Moliere, by attacking with ridicule the learning of women, made not only its extravagancies, but the ta&s;te it&s;elf, di&s;|appear. Some women afterwards devot|ed them&s;elves to letters, and &s;ome culti|vated
<PB N="63" REF="013650_0195_0F91A4E81A513E60">the &s;ciences; but that &s;pirit was by no means general.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t enlightened age, women were not permitted to be intelligent, with|out becoming the objects of deri&s;ion. They were obliged to hide them&s;elves to improve their minds; and they blu&s;hed on the di&s;covery of their knowledge, as much as, in ruder ages, they had blu&s;hed on the di&s;covery of an intrigue.</P>
<P>AS all good has its exce&s;s, and a pro|verb cannot need a rea&s;on; by a&s;&s;ociating what is ridiculous with what is re&s;pecta|ble, the learning of women, like every thing el&s;e, may be brought into contempt. To examine the que&s;tion however impar|tially, it appears, that in a country and in an age very remote from that primi|tive innocence which attaches the heart to the pure plea&s;ures of retirement, and which makes us happy in the ignorance of every thing &mdash; but our duty; in an age when the general manners are cor|rupted by idlene&s;s; when all the vices mingle by di&s;&s;ipation; and when the vir|tues
<PB N="64" REF="013650_0196_0F91A3847514DA18">cannot be replaced, or &s;upplied, but by the help of rea&s;on, in&s;tead of deter|ring women from in&s;tructing them&s;elves, it mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary to encourage them. Not all the humour of Moliere had been able to rai&s;e a laugh again&s;t the lovely &s;ex, on account of their learning if he had not &s;ub&s;tituted folly for wi&s;dom. Socrates peri&s;hed by &s;uch a mi&s;application of ri|dicule.</P>
<P>If Moliere, in place of ridiculing the abu&s;e of learning in women, had exhibit|ed an example of its happy effects, op|po&s;ed to thoughtle&s;s levity and giddy amu&s;ement; if he had painted a woman, young and beautiful, who&s;e mind was opened by a liberal education, and who retained all the graces of her &s;ex; who could think deeply, but who a&s;&s;umed no|thing; who covered her knowledge with a gentle veil, and who always had a fa|cility of temper, a pre&s;ence of mind, and an ea&s;e of manner, which made her mo&s;t profound rea&s;onings appear to be the re|&s;ult of nature; who could e&s;timate and feel the greate&s;t concerns, without being
<PB N="65" REF="013650_0197_0F91A3853330D008">above the lea&s;t; who pro&s;ecuted her &s;peculations only to heighten the com|merce of friend&s;hip, and render more ex|qui&s;ite the intercour&s;e of affection; who, in &s;tudying and knowing the heart of man, had learned to have more indul|gence for his weakne&s;&s;es, and more re|&s;pect for his virtues; who, in &s;hort, rank|ed her duties above all things, but her mental accompli&s;hments next to her du|ties, and who only employed in &s;tudy what may be called the VOID of life &mdash; the intervals of &s;ociety, and the rece&s;s of do|me&s;tic affairs, in bettering her heart by embelli&s;hing her under&s;tanding; &mdash; he would have done a real &s;ervice to women, to virtue, to his country, and to the world.</P>
<P>But though the women under Lewis XIV. were, in general, laughed out of their pa&s;&s;ion for letters, the politene&s;s of the age introduced a &s;pirit &s;omewhat al|lied to it, and which was then much in fa&s;hion, particularly at court. It may be called the TALENT OF SOCIETY: an amiable kind of genius which delights in
<PB N="66" REF="013650_0198_0F91A3861158AC80">light graces, which is fonder of beauty than &s;ublimity, and which borrows few of its ornaments from &s;cience, or does it in &s;o ea&s;y a way that ignorance cannot be jealous, and knowledge dares not blame; which throws out agreeable trifles, and which &s;ometimes can bring it&s;elf to com|po&s;e with elegance a few facetious or &s;prightly ver&s;es; which always charms in conver&s;ation, without &s;eeming to aim at it; which plea&s;es every body; which humbles nobody; and even when it &s;hines mo&s;t, which has a manner that pleads its excu&s;e, and makes us perceive that it is free from o&s;tentation or vanity.

It was &s;he who fir&s;t introduced into the romance &s;enti|ment in place of adventure, and agreeable men in&s;tead of heroes. She performed in her walk what Racine did in his.

After all the&s;e accompli&s;hed women, commended with levity by the poets, or gravity by the orators, there are &s;till two, who, though of a rank and order dif|ferent, arrived neverthele&s;s at the high|e&s;t celebrity. The one is the famous Mademoi&s;elle de Scudery, who lived to the age of eighty-five, &s;ixty years of which period &s;he &s;pent in writing with elegance &s;ome pretty ver&s;es, which are &s;till admired, and with an amazing faci|lity voluminous romances, which are no more read. The&s;e romances however were once able to turn heads; and the
<PB N="68" REF="013650_0200_0F91A389D8C35718">prejudice in favour of her manner was almo&s;t a match for the &s;atires and ta&s;te of Boileau. The other is the learned Mademoi&s;elle le Febvre, &s;o well known under the name of Madam Dacier. Her merit, it is true, was not that of a woman, but &s;he cho&s;e a good time to a&s;&s;ume the character of a man; and, though &s;he had not the manner of Ninon, &s;he did not want her admirers. The two languages natural to her, were tho&s;e of Terence and Homer; and madrigals were often &s;ent to her in Greek and Latin. The mo&s;t learned men in Europe con&s;pired to &s;ound her prai&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;ay nothing of the other women who wrote about the &s;ame time. The cata|logue is every where to be found. Be|&s;ides, I &s;peak only here of the women who&s;e genius had a character, and who can &s;erve to illu&s;trate the ideas or the manners of their age. This is a picture, not a hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the manners, and the general character of the women of that age
<PB N="69" REF="013650_0201_0F91A38AD3856408">was, a voluptuou&s;ne&s;s united with decency; activity directed to intrigue; little learn|ing; many accompli&s;hments; a refined politene&s;s; a remnant of empire over men; a re&s;pect for all the religious ideas, which mingled them&s;elves with that co|quetry of manners, and remor&s;e always by the &s;ide, or in the train of love.</P>
<P>During the regency, and under the reign of Lewis XV. the manners under|went another revolution. The latter years of Lewis XIV. had &s;hed over the court, and part of the nation, an air of dejection and melancholy. At bottom the inclinations were the &s;ame; but they were more repre&s;&s;ed. A new court and new ideas changed all things. A bolder &s;en&s;uality became the fa&s;hion. The de|&s;ires grew more confident and impetuous; and part of the veil which covered gal|lantry was torn away. Decency, which had hitherto been re&s;pected as a duty, was not even regarded as a plea&s;ure. Shame was mutually communicated&mdash;and mutually pardoned. Levity joined it&s;elf to exce&s;s; and a corruption was formed
<PB N="70" REF="013650_0202_0F91A38B3553A068">at the &s;ame time frivolous and deep, which laughed at every thing, that it might blu&s;h at nothing.</P>
<P>The ruin of families, and the &s;hifting of fortunes, precipitated this change. Exce&s;&s;ive mi&s;ery and exce&s;&s;ive luxury were the con&s;equences;&mdash;and the influ|ence of the&s;e is known. A &s;udden re|volution rarely happens in the property of a people, without a quick alteration in manners.</P>
<P>For upwards of &s;ix centuries, gallantry had formed the character of the nation; but the &s;pirit of chivalry always mingled it&s;elf with that &s;entiment; which &s;pirit, in&s;eparably connected with honour, gave to gallantry at lea&s;t the RESEMBLANCE of love, and to vice as much of virtue as its nature is &s;u&s;ceptible of. But when few traces of ancient honour remained, gallantry it&s;elf was lo&s;t; it became a &s;en|timent which always &s;uppo&s;ed weakne&s;s, or endeavoured to produce it.</P>
<P>In the mean time, by that general &s;ym|pathy
<PB N="71" REF="013650_0203_0F91A38C003E60C0">which attracted all ranks, the ta&s;te for the &s;ociety of women increa&s;ed, and the intercour&s;e of the &s;exes became more frequent. Hope grew more &s;anguine, as &s;eduction grew more ea&s;y. The men every day a&s;&s;ociated le&s;s with each other; the women, le&s;s timid, threw off that decent re&s;erve which is their honour. The two &s;exes changed characters; the men &s;et too high a value upon per&s;onal charms, the women on independence.</P>
<P>As the youths were more anxious to be men of the world than men of bu|&s;ine&s;s, they entered &s;ooner into &s;ociety. The&s;e young men, corrupted by the libertine part of the other &s;ex, joined the faults of their age to tho&s;e of their cha|racter. Having in general more de&s;ires than ideas, an empty head and an un|principled heart,&mdash;incon&s;tant through vanity, or multiplying their amours from idlene&s;s, &mdash; &s;etting no value upon opinion, which for them indeed had no exi&s;t|ence, &mdash;they communicated to a great number of women their vices and irregu|larities.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="013650_0204_0F91A38CB9EB9F18">
The irk&s;omne&s;s of time, and the univer&s;al de&s;ire to plea&s;e, &s;pread &s;till wider and wider the &s;pirit of &s;ociety, till the nation arrived at its pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociability and general intercour&s;e, where manners and character are &s;acrificed to elegance and politene&s;s, while virtue and &s;entiment are exchanged for plea&s;ure and amu&s;ement.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. Of the Progre&s;s of Society in BRITAIN, and of the Character, Manners, and Talents of the BRITISH WOMEN.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT poli&s;hed nations under|&s;tand by &s;ociety, appears to have been little known in England, be|fore the reign of Henry VIII. This backwardne&s;s may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be a&s;cribed to our continual wars with France and with Scotland: by our quarrels with the one we were &s;hut out from foreign intercour&s;e, and by our ho&s;tilities with both we were diverted from cultivating the arts of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="013650_0205_0F91A38D7AF89E60">
The &s;pirit of chivalry, which produced &s;uch amazing effects on the Continent, was more weakly felt here. Edward III. had indeed e&s;tabli&s;hed the order of the garter; but real wars allowed the knights little time for the mock encounter, or the generous vi&s;ions of romantic heroi&s;m; and love was &s;till a &s;imple pa&s;&s;ion, which led the &s;horte&s;t way to its gratification, and generally in conformity with law and cu&s;tom. It partook little of imagination; and, con&s;equently, required few perfec|tions in its object: it a&s;pired neither at angels nor godde&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The women, who &s;till retained all their native innocence and mode&s;ty, were regarded only as wives and mothers. Where qualifications are not demanded they will never be found: the accom|pli&s;hments of the &s;ex entitled them to no other character; and it had perhaps been happy for both &s;exes, if they could have remained in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;impli|city.</P>
<P>The Scots, by means of their alliance
<PB N="74" REF="013650_0206_0F91A38E33C80310">with France, which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;everal centuries, and that &s;pirit of adventure which has at all times led them abroad in que&s;t of reputation, civil or military, may be &s;uppo&s;ed at this time to have been better acquainted with the elegancies of life than their wealthy and powerful neighbours: &mdash; and we actually find, in the court of James IV. a ta&s;te in mu&s;ic, in letters, and in gallantry, to which the great monarch of the hou&s;e of Tudor and his haughty barons were yet &s;trangers.</P>
<P>But the political &s;tate of both king|doms was an in&s;uperable bar to all libe|ral intercour&s;e. The barons, or chiefs, were ho&s;tile to the court, from which they had every thing to fear, and nothing to hope; they were dreaded by it in their turn; they looked from the walls of their ca&s;tles with a jealous eye on each other; they never went abroad but attended by a numerous train of dome&s;tics; they vi&s;ited each other with the &s;tate, and the diffidence of neighbouring princes; their marriages were contracted from family motives, and their court&s;hips were con|ducted
<PB N="75" REF="013650_0207_0F91A391756AD9B8">with the greate&s;t form, and the mo&s;t di&s;tant re&s;pect. They took liberties indeed with the women of inferior con|dition, and they rioted in thoughtle&s;s jol|lity with their dependents: but the ideas of inferiority and dependence are incom|patible with tho&s;e of &s;ociety and gallan|try.</P>
<P>Henry VII. by curbing the ho&s;tile &s;pirit of the Barons, by abridging their power, by dimini&s;hing their retainers; by extending commerce; by encouraging agriculture; by &s;ecuring peace to his &s;ubjects, at home and abroad, prepared the way for learning, arts and elegance. But the ta&s;te of the nation was not yet ripe for their reception; and the temper of his &s;on Henry VIII. was not highly favourable to &s;uch a revolution. That prince, however, by his ta&s;te for tourna|ments, fo&s;tered the &s;pirit of chivalry; and, by his pa&s;&s;ion for controver&s;y, he encouraged a &s;pecies of learning, though not the mo&s;t agreeable: by his magnifi|cence and profu&s;ion he drew the nobility to court; who, &s;ince deprived of their
<PB N="76" REF="013650_0208_0F91A39365DB0658">judicial authority, had le&s;s bu&s;ine&s;s to de|tain them in the country; and, by his interviews with the emperor and the French King, he rou&s;ed their emulation of foreign elegance: they were &s;mit with the love of letters and of gallantry. The earl of Surrey, in particular, celebrated his mi&s;tre&s;s in his ver&s;es, and defended her honour with his &s;word, again&s;t all who dared with unhallowed lips profane her immaculate name.</P>
<P>The women in this reign likewi&s;e be|gan to di&s;cover a ta&s;te for literature and politene&s;s. The counte&s;s of Richmond, mother to Henry VII. and who &s;urvived him, had &s;hewn the way. She tran&s;lated two pious treati&s;es from the French; and was a great patrone&s;s of learning. Eli|zabeth Blount, mi&s;tre&s;s to Henry VIII. was a woman of elegant accompli&s;hments; and his la&s;t queen Catherine Parr, wrote with facility both in Latin and in Engli&s;h, and appears be&s;ides to have been a wo|man of addre&s;s.</P>
<P>But the hou&s;e of Sir Thomas Moore,
<PB N="77" REF="013650_0209_0F91A393A7FE4FD0">who&s;e elde&s;t daughter, Mrs. Roper, has been already mentioned among the learn|ed women of this period, &s;eems in a more particular manner to have been the ha|bitation of the Mu&s;es, and even of the Graces. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the learning of antiquity; he was pious even to weakne&s;s; for he appears to have given credit to the prophe&s;ies of the Maid of Kent; but neither his religion nor his learning &s;oured his temper, or blunt|ed his ta&s;te for &s;ociety. His ideas of the female character would do honour to a gentleman of the pre&s;ent age. In an elegant Latin poem to a friend on the choice of a wife, he &s;peaks to the fol|lowing purpo&s;e. <Q>May you meet with a wife not &s;tupidly &s;ilent, nor always prattling non&s;en&s;e; may &s;he be learned, if po&s;&s;ible, or at lea&s;t capable of being made &s;o. A woman thus accompli&s;h|ed will be always drawing &s;entiments and maxims out of the be&s;t authors. She will be her&s;elf, in all the changes of fortune; neither blown up with pro&s;perity, nor broken in adver&s;ity. You will find in her an even, cheerful,
<PB N="78" REF="013650_0210_0F91A394B405CF60">good-humoured friend, and an agree|able companion for life. She will in|fu&s;e knowledge into your children with their milk, and from their infancy train them up to wi&s;dom. Whatever com|pany you are engaged in, you will long to be at home; and will retire with delight from the &s;ociety of men, into the bo&s;om of a woman who is &s;o dear, &s;o knowing, and &s;o amiable. If &s;he touches her lute, and more particularly if &s;he &s;ings to it any of her own com|po&s;itions, it will &s;ooth your &s;olitude, and her voice will &s;ound &s;weeter in your ear than the &s;ong of the nightin|gale. You will &s;pend whole days and nights with plea&s;ure in her company, and you will be always finding out new beauties in her mind. She will keep your &s;oul in perpetual &s;erenity; &s;he will re&s;train its mirth from being di&s;&s;o|lute, and prevent its melancholy from becoming painful.</Q> &mdash; According to the&s;e ideas he educated his three daughters, who&s;e virtues and talents appear to have merited all his care. They lived for &s;ome time in one hou&s;e, with their father, their
<PB N="79" REF="013650_0211_0F91A394F4063CC0">hu&s;bands, and their children, and form|ed a &s;ociety, all things con&s;idered, which has &s;eldom, if ever, been equalled, in any age or country; &mdash; where morals were &s;ublimed by religion; where manners were poli&s;hed by a &s;en&s;e of elegance, and &s;oftened by a de&s;ire to plea&s;e; where friend&s;hip was warmed by love, and &s;trengthened by the ties of blood; &mdash; while conver&s;ation, animated by genius; enrich|ed by learning, and moderated by re&s;pect, exulting in the dignity of its objects, &s;eem|ed to approach to that fine tran&s;port, which immortal beings may be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel in pouring out their contemplati|ons of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the Creator; and, when it conde&s;cended to treat of lighter &s;ubjects, wit had a &s;pring, humour a flow, and &s;entiment a poig|nancy, which tho&s;e who are eternally di&s;|cour&s;ing of trifles, who hover continually on the &s;urface of the earth, and rove like butterflies from &s;en&s;e to &s;en&s;e, both in their lives and conver&s;ations, can have no conception.</P>
<P>The religious conte&s;ts, the reforma|tions,
<PB N="80" REF="013650_0212_0F91A396E0872218">and the pre&s;ecutions, which dis|figured the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII. and which continued, with little intermi&s;&s;ion, till the death of queen Mary, were a great bar to the progre&s;s of elegance and politene&s;s in England: but it may be doubted how far they were hurtful to learning or to manners. Both parties, and both &s;exes, were uncom|monly zealous to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by virtues and by talents. Lady Jane Gray, and the three Seymours, who lived in this period, have already been mentioned among the ornaments of the &s;ixteenth century. Queen Mary her&s;elf was a writer of no mean rank; and Mary Roper, grand-daughter of Sir Tho|mas More, and one of the GENTLE-WOMEN, as they were then called, of her maje&s;ty's PRIVY-CHAMBER, is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the learning and accompli&s;hments of her mother. She mu&s;t have done honour to the court.</P>
<P>The reign of Elizabeth is ju&s;tly con|&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t &s;hining pe|riods in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory; and for purity
<PB N="81" REF="013650_0213_0F91A397362196F8">of manners, vigour of mind, vigour of character, and per&s;onal addre&s;s, it is perhaps unequalled.</P>
<P>The magnificent entertainments which that illu&s;trious prince&s;s &s;o frequently gave her court, and at which &s;he generally appeared in per&s;on, with a mo&s;t engage|ing familiarity, rubbed off the ancient re&s;erve of the nobility, and increa&s;ed the ta&s;te of &s;ociety, and even of gallantry: but the ma&s;culine boldne&s;s of her charac|ter was unfavourable to famale graces. The women of her court, like her&s;elf, were rather objects of re&s;pect than love. Their virtues were &s;evere; their learn|ing, their talents were often great: they had pa&s;&s;ions, but they knew to &s;uppre&s;s them, or to divert them into the chan|nel of intere&s;t or ambition. They did not however want their admirers. Men were le&s;s delicate in tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>Spen&s;er, by writing his Fairy Queen, revived in Britain the &s;pirit of chivalry, at a time when it began to expire on the continent, and Sir Philip Sidney, in his
<PB N="82" REF="013650_0214_0F91A39804DDBA40">Arcadia, refined on that &s;entiment. The Fairy Queen was intended as a compli|ment to Elizabeth; and the Arcadia was dedicated by Sir Philip to his &s;i&s;ter, the counte&s;s of Pembroke, the mo&s;t amiable and accompli&s;hed woman of her time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following ingenious and well known ver&s;es were intended as part of her epitaph.

<P>But the mo&s;t remarkable women of this reign were the Lady Burleigh, the Lady Bacon, the Lady Ru&s;&s;el, and Mrs. Killgrew, all daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke, and all di&s;tingui&s;hed for learn|ing, genius, and virtue.</P>
<P>Elizabeth her&s;elf was a great and &s;ingu|lar character. But &s;he had few qualities to recommend her as a woman, though pa&s;&s;ionately fond of per&s;onal admiration; nor were her talents as a writer either &s;triking or elegant, though &s;he appears to have been ambitious of literary fame.
<PB N="83" REF="013650_0215_0F91A398B78BE8E0">Her ability as a &s;overign has been already con&s;idered, in treating of the talent of women for government. Her virtues were tho&s;e of her rank, and of her age; and her weakne&s;s, tho&s;e of her &s;ex: yet they failed to render her amiable.</P>
<P>Mary queen of Scotland, (who&s;e learn|ing and accompli&s;hments have been al|ready mentioned) the cotemporary of Elizabeth, and her rival in beauty, in let|ters, and in &s;way, though a le&s;s perfect, is a more attractive character. While we blame her conduct &s;he conciliates our affection. Even tho&s;e who accu&s;e her of guilt, mu&s;t weep for her misfortunes; and will feel their bo&s;oms &s;well with in|dignation again&s;t her inhuman &s;ubjects, and her per&s;idious protectre&s;s, while they read her unhappy &s;tory, as told by her enemies.</P>
<P>The return of Mary to her native kingdom, after the death of her hu&s;band Francis II. with all the elegancies of France &s;upperadded to the fine&s;t natural endowments, made the Scots hope, and
<PB N="84" REF="013650_0216_0F91A39975A39CF8">not without rea&s;on, that literature, arts, and politene&s;s, would arrive at perfection among them, as &s;oon as in any northern nation. But the &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m, which awaked in Scotland about this time, which was attended with &s;uch amazing effects, and which &s;pread it&s;elf over the whole i&s;land; which produced the death of the lovely Mary, of the pious Charles, and which terminated in the expul&s;ion of the royal hou&s;e, threw a cloud over the man|ners and the &s;tudies of that country, which two centuries have &s;carcely been able to di&s;pel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A bold &s;pirit of liberty and independence however, which has been productive of many great and beneficial con&s;equences, mingled it&s;elf with that fanatical &s;pirit, and ought for ever to free the Scots from the imputation of &s;ervility.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of James VI. to the throne of England, contributed &s;till far|ther to ob&s;truct the progre&s;s to civilizati|on in Scotland, and to the decline of the arts in that country. The removal of the court, drew the nobility to London, to &s;pend their fortunes, or obtain prefer|ment; and men of genius and learning likewi&s;e looked this way.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="013650_0217_0F91A39A33E85098">
That event, however, mu&s;t have con|tributed to the advancement of &s;ociety in England. Yet not &s;o much as might be expected. The &s;cantine&s;s of James's re|venue, together with his want of oecono|my, rendered him unable to &s;upport the &s;plendor of a court. It was be&s;ides in|con&s;i&s;tent with his maxims of policy, and with his temper. He loved to be &s;ocial with his friends, but hated a crowd; and had rather an aver&s;ion to the com|pany of woman. A mean jealou&s;y, which took place of a generous emulation, be|tween the Scots and Engli&s;h courtiers, prevented &s;till farther the refinement of manners; which can only be effected by a liberal intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>The nobility and gentry of England are &s;till fonder of a country life than tho&s;e of any poli&s;hed nation in Europe: it prevailed much more then, and was highly encouraged by James. He even i&s;&s;ued proclamations, containing &s;evere threatnings again&s;t the gentry who lived in town. By the&s;e means the ancient pride of family was pre&s;erved. Men of
<PB N="86" REF="013650_0218_0F91A39B14ED77B8">birth were di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;tateline&s;s of carriage: much ceremony took place in the ordinary commerce of life; and, as riches acquired by trade were &s;till rare, little familiarity was indulged by the great.</P>
<P>The king's pacific, or rather pu&s;ilani|mous di&s;po&s;ition, though it &s;unk the na|tional character, was favourable to com|merce, and not altogether unfriendly to letters. James him&s;elf was a &s;cholar; but he was unhappy in a bad ta&s;te, which infected his whole court, and indeed the whole nation. He was fond of metaphy|&s;ical quibbles, the jingle of words, and every &s;pecies of fal&s;e wit. Such a ta&s;te is in &s;ome mea&s;ure in&s;eparable from the revival of letters: we admire what is glaring, before we can di&s;cern what is beautiful; but the &s;anction, and even the example of the monarch, only could have carried it to &s;uch a height at this time in England. What induces one particu|larly to this opinion is, the comparative purity of the writers of the former reign. The contra&s;t between the compo&s;ition of
<PB N="87" REF="013650_0219_0F91A39BB2CD3BD8">Spencer and Drayton, is as great as be|tween the character of Elizabeth and James.</P>
<P>The theatre, that great former of manners, and which is formed by them, had been founded by Shake&s;peare under the reign of Elizabeth: he was &s;ucceeded by Jon&s;on and Fletcher. The&s;e writers have &s;eldom painted the manners of their own country, and &s;eldomer tho&s;e of their own age; but, as they mu&s;t have endea|voured to plea&s;e the people for whom they wrote, and as they no doubt knew the ta&s;te of the public, we may di&s;cern that ta&s;te more perfectly in their compo&s;itions than in the barren records of the times.</P>
<P>In the writings of Shake&s;peare we find all the noble &s;pirit of the virgin-reign. Love has its native importance; and little more: it is productive of the greate&s;t events, when connected with circum&s;tan|ces: but, when a &s;imple pa&s;&s;ion, its effects are feeble and tran&s;ient.

We may therefore conclude, that the pa&s;&s;ion, or rather the commerce, between the &s;exes was increa&s;ed; that it was am|bitious of being thought more important than it really was; that it had purpo&s;es to carry which made &s;uch exaggeration nece&s;&s;ary, that it had wi&s;hes to reveal which it dur&s;t not avow; and which, con&s;equently, &s;ugge&s;ted the di&s;gui&s;e of de|licate expre&s;&s;ion.

<P>Under Charles I. a good ta&s;te in let|ters, in arts, and in &s;ociety, began to pre|vail. The king him&s;elf was both a judge and an example of fine writing; and he was a lover of painting, mu&s;ic, and archi|tecture; all which he liberally encourag|ed. But the religious and political di&s;|putes, which early in this reign divided the nation, and which brought about the death of the king, and the &s;ubver&s;ion of the monarchy, diverted the thoughts of men from every elegant pur&s;uit. The dread of popery and arbitrary power, of

<P>The cavaliers, or royal party, how|ever, notwith&s;tanding the horrors of civil war, maintained a gaiety of temper which was altogether a&s;toni&s;hing, and a free|dom of manners which too often border|ed on licentiou&s;ne&s;s. But the republi|cans, though perhaps not infected with fewer vices, and tho&s;e of a le&s;s amiable ca&s;t, di&s;cover &s;o much vigour of mind, &s;uch a re&s;olute &s;pirit of action, a love of freedom, and a contempt of death, that we almo&s;t de&s;pi&s;e the poli&s;h of &s;ociety,&mdash;even while we dete&s;t the cant of hypo|cri&s;y.</P>

<P>Under the commonwealth the face of the nation was entirely changed; it ex|perienced a revolution, as complete in manners as in policy. One would have imagined him&s;elf in a different world. The theatres were &s;hut; games, &s;ports, &s;hews, and amu&s;ements of every kind were prohibited. In&s;tead of the voice of
<PB N="92" REF="013650_0224_0F91A3A34441BCA8">mirth and joy, nothing was to be heard but groans, &s;ighs, prayers, and &s;piritual &s;ongs. All liberal knowledge, ornamental learning, gentility of manner, elegance of dre&s;s, and all &s;uperfluity in eating and drinking were pro&s;cribed, as carnal vani|ties, and as the accomplices of &s;in and Sa|tan. All ranks, ages, and &s;exes were con|founded. The illuminations of the &s;pirit placed all on a level. The leaders of the republic prayed, or exhorted one while, and li&s;tened the next to the meane&s;t of the people. Women taught the brethren.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e fair divines, by rea&s;on of their finer feelings and more vivid imagina|tions, were often carried into the mo&s;t extraordinary &s;everities, and the wilde&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m. They were not contented with laying a&s;ide the allurements of their &s;ex, with making a covenant with their eyes that they &s;hould not rove, and with crucifying their thoughts; they con|demned them&s;elves to humiliation and fa&s;ting, for the wandering of their hearts. Many of them con&s;idered cloaths of any kind to be improper. Whether this

<P>Love under the commonwealth, was a mixture of cant and hypocri&s;y. Never was beauty &s;o much in di&s;grace. It was not only denied all adventitious orna|ments and excellencies, but even the ad|vantages of nature were &s;ubject of re|proach:&mdash;it was forbid to plea&s;e; and it was criminal to con&s;ider it as an object of de&s;ire.</P>
<P>'Man,' &s;aid the godly.&mdash;for &s;o they called them&s;elves,&mdash; <Q>is conceived in &s;in, and brought forth in iniquity; he is a &s;lave to the fle&s;h, till regenerated by the &s;pirit; it was his complacency in woman that fir&s;t wrought his deba&s;e|ment: let him not therefore glory in his &s;hame, let him not wor&s;hip the fountain of his corruption!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="013650_0227_0F91A3A5799FE848">
The emotions of nature were con&s;ider|ed as the &s;truggles of original guilt; and beauty was viewed as a &s;pell in the hands of Satan, to &s;educe the hearts of the faith|ful. The plea&s;ures of the marriage-bed were only indulged as the means of pre|venting a greater evil, and of increa&s;ing the number of the &s;aints; nor even then without fear and trembling, humiliation, and prayer, <Q>that they might be &s;eparat|ed from the CURSE!</Q></P>
<P>But the re&s;toration of monarchy made ample amends to beauty for the indigni|ties of the commonwealth. The reign of Charles II. may be con&s;idered in one light, as the mo&s;t glorious era to women in the hi&s;tory of Britain, and as the mo&s;t deba&s;ing in another. They were never &s;o much care&s;&s;ed; never &s;o little re&s;pect|ed.</P>
<P>Charles him&s;elf had a &s;u&s;ceptible, but changeable heart; a &s;ocial temper; a genteel manner; a lively wit:&mdash;and his courtiers partook much of the character of their ma&s;ter. They had all &s;uffered
<PB N="96" REF="013650_0228_0F91A3A63883F4E0">the pre&s;&s;ure of adver&s;ity, the neglect of poverty, or felt the in&s;olence of pious ty|ranny. They began to think that Chri&s;ti|anity was a fable; that virtue was a cheat; that friend&s;hip and genero&s;ity were but words of cour&s;e; and, in greedily en|joying their change of fortune, they &s;unk them&s;elves beneath the dignity of men. In avoiding &s;piritual pride, and in retali|ating &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, they departed from the e&s;&s;ential principles of religion and morals; and, by contra&s;ting the language and the manners of hypocri&s;y, they &s;hamele&s;sly violated the laws of decency and deco|rum.</P>
<P>Overjoyed at the return of their &s;ove|reign, the whole royal party di&s;&s;olved in thoughtle&s;s jollity; and even many of the republicans, particularly the younger cla&s;s. and the women, were glad to be relea&s;ed from the gloomy au&s;terity of the commonwealth. A general relax|ation of manners took place. Plea&s;ure became the univer&s;al object, and love the prevailing ta&s;te: but that love was rather an appetite than a pa&s;&s;ion. Beau|ty,
<PB N="97" REF="013650_0229_0F91A3A7063120F8">unconnected with virtue, was its object: it was therefore void of honour and attachment. In con&s;equence of &s;uch manners, famale virtue, robbed of its reward, became rather a mode of beha|viour, to inflame de&s;ire, or procure ele|vation, than a &s;entiment or principle; and, of cour&s;e, &s;ooner or later, was either &s;acrificed to inclination or to caprice.</P>
<P>But the&s;e ob&s;ervations, in their full extent, mu&s;t only be under&s;tood of the court. The greater part of the gentry &s;till re&s;ided on their e&s;tates in the coun|try, equally &s;trangers to the plea&s;ures of the court and town; and one half of the i&s;land was filled with indignation at the vices of Whitehall. Nor without rea&s;on; for it was little better than one great bro|thel &mdash; and the &s;tage, which generally takes its complexion from the court, was a con|tinued &s;cene of &s;en&s;uality, bla&s;phemy, and ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>The free intercour&s;e, however of all ranks of men, from the king to the com|moner,
<PB N="98" REF="013650_0230_0F91A3AAAAE57200">improved the talent of &s;ociety, and poli&s;hed the language of conver&s;ation; gallantry, licentious as it was, produced a habit of politene&s;s; and from the irre|gular, and even impious freedom of writ|ing and thinking, &s;prung many &s;trokes of real genius, and a liberal &s;pirit of inquiry, who&s;e re&s;earches and experiments have benefited mankind, and carried philo&s;o|phy and the &s;ciences to a height that does honour to modern times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The royal Society was founded under Charles II.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The women of this reign, as may be expected from the ta&s;te of the men, were more &s;olicitous about adorning their per|&s;ons, than informing their minds. But the frequent intercour&s;e between the &s;exes in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ated that neglect. By &s;uch a commerce they be|came more ea&s;y, more free, more lively, and more capable of conver&s;ation, than the women of any preceding age. They had le&s;s learning, but more accompli&s;h|ments; and perhaps, more genius. They
<PB N="99" REF="013650_0231_0F91A3ACA610C040">wanted nothing but virtue to have made their memories immortal: and, notwith|&s;tanding the general depravity, there were &s;ome who trod the narrow path; who&s;e ta&s;te and &s;entiments were uncor|rupted, and who&s;e names &s;till live in their writings, and in the ver&s;es of their cotemporaries. Katherine Philips, (ce|lebrated under the name of Orinda) Anne Killegrew, and Anne Wharton, employed their elegant talents in a manner &s;uitable to their &s;ex. The female wantons of mo&s;t genius were Behn and Centlivre, who&s;e writings are both their honour and their di&s;grace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this cen&s;ure however, may be excepted the Hi&s;tory of Oroonoko, and the Comedy of the Bu&s;y Body.</NOTE>.&mdash; Among the women of elegant, or &s;pirited conver&s;ation, we &s;hould perhaps di&s;tingui&s;h the Dutche&s;s of York, the Dutche&s;s of Cleveland, Lady Che&s;terfield, and the fair Hamilton.</P>
<P>The reign of James II. was too &s;hort to have any di&s;tinct character. It is only &s;ingular for the blind bigotry, and blinder
<PB N="100" REF="013650_0232_0F91A3ADDAD22E30">di&s;po&s;ition of the prince; which rou&s;ed the minds of men from the delirium of plea&s;ure, in which they had been lo&s;t, and brought about the Revolution.</P>
<P>Under William III. the effects of that change were vi&s;ible on the manners. The nation returned to what may be called its natural &s;tate. An attention to ju&s;t politics, to found philo&s;ophy, and true religion, characterize the era of Briti&s;h liberty.</P>
<P>William him&s;elf was of a gloomy temper, and had a di&s;like to the com|pany of women. The intercour&s;e of the &s;exes, and tho&s;e amu&s;ements which are its con&s;equence, were therefore little countenanced during his reign. By the&s;e means the ladies had more time for the pur&s;uits of learning and know|ledge; and they made u&s;e of it accord|ingly. Many of them became adepts in the &s;ciences. Lady Ma&s;ham, and Mary A&s;tell, in particular, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with judg|ment and ability the mo&s;t ab&s;tract points
<PB N="101" REF="013650_0233_0F91A3AE779C0DB0">in metaphy&s;ics and divinity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e two ladies differed on a very delicate point.

She is celebrated by Mr. Congreve.</P>
<P>The reign of queen Anne may be &s;aid to have been the &s;ummer, of which William's was only the &s;pring. Every thing was ripened; nothing was cor|rupted. It was a &s;hort, but glorious period, of heroi&s;m and national capa|city; of ta&s;te and &s;cience, learning and genius; of gallantry without licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, and politene&s;s without effeminacy.</P>
<P>We are in doubt which mo&s;t to ad|mire in the women of this reign, the
<PB N="102" REF="013650_0234_0F91A3AF4BF00F90">manners, the talents, or the accompli&s;h|ments. They were religious without &s;e|verity, and without enthu&s;ia&s;m; they were learned without pedantry; they were intelligent and attractive, without neglecting the duties of their &s;ex; they were elegant and entertaining, without levity; in a word, they joined the graces of &s;ociety to the knowledge of letters and the virtues of dome&s;tic life&mdash;they were friends and companions, without cea&s;ing to be wives and mothers.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the foregoing character of the Briti&s;h ladies under the reign of queen Anne, we need only add the names of Lady Chudleigh, Lady Winchel&s;ea, the honourable Mrs. Monk, Mrs. Bovey, and Stella<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the&s;e ladies, Mrs. Bovey is perhaps the lea&s;t known, as &s;he has left no writings, and had no poeti|cal lover to &s;pread her name.

Under George 1. the manners of the nation were &s;en&s;ibly changed; but not &s;o much as the national &s;pirit. The South Sea &s;cheme, and other mercenary projects, produced a pa&s;&s;ion of avarice, and a ta&s;te of luxury, which prepared the way for all the corruptions of the following reign.</P>
<P>The delirium of riches was beyond what the mo&s;t extravagant imagination can conceive. Any &s;cheme, however ab&s;urd, met with encouragement, if it only propo&s;ed &s;ufficient advantages. All ranks and conditions, and even women, re&s;orted to 'Change-Alley, with the looks of harpies ready to &s;eize upon their prey; but, in reality, the victims of their own credulity and &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>At this cri&s;is Robert Walpole, an art|ful and able mini&s;ter, a lover of peace and an encourager of commerce, found means to increa&s;e the influence of the crown without enlarging the prerogative. But he did it at the expence of the virtues of the people:&mdash;and his example has been followed by all &s;ucceeding mini&s;ters. He took advantage of that &s;pirit of avarice and luxury which he had fo&s;tered; the trea&s;ury was let loo&s;e at elections.

Places and pen&s;ions were multiplied to reward the mercenary tribe; and men of ability and integrity were deprived of their employments, to make way for tho&s;e who were de&s;titute of both. When virtue and talents are no longer the means of honour and preferment, they naturally di&s;appear in the public

But people mu&s;t always have &s;omething to be the founda|tion of &s;elf-applau&s;e. In&s;tead of the e&s;|&s;ential qualities of men and of citizens, they valued them&s;elves on a &s;mooth addre&s;s, and an ab&s;urd mixture of French levity and Engli&s;h gravity; on the &s;plendor of their equipages; on the magnificence of their hou&s;es; on the richne&s;s of their furniture; and on the elegance and &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of their tables.</P>
<P>The ruin of many ancient families by the late vi&s;ionary projects, and the exce&s;|&s;ive fortunes acquired by trade, contri|buted &s;till farther to increa&s;e the general ma&s;s of manners. The pride of birth, the la&s;t barrier of corruption, was broken down. While people value them&s;elves upon their ance&s;tors, it is to be pre&s;um|ed,
<PB N="107" REF="013650_0239_0F91A3B5F5A9DAA0">that their actions will not be altoge|ther unworthy of them.

<P>The manners of the two &s;exes, as has been already ob&s;erved, generally keep pace with each other. In proportion as the men grew regardle&s;s of character, the women neglected the duties of their &s;ex. Though little inclined to hoarding, they are not perhaps le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to avarice than men: gold to them is de&s;ireable, as the mini&s;ter of vanity, voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hew. It became their &s;upreme ob|ject,
<PB N="109" REF="013650_0241_0F91A3B844DF44C8">and the only &s;ource of the matrimo|nial union, to the exclu&s;ion of that tender &s;entiment which alone can give &s;trength to the &s;acred tie, or plea&s;ure to the nup|tial &s;tate. The young, the beautiful, the healthful, were wedded &mdash; though not al|ways with their own con&s;ent &mdash; to age, de|formity, and di&s;ea&s;e; virtue was joined to profligacy, and wantonne&s;s to &s;eve|rity.</P>
<P>Such marriages were nece&s;&s;arily de|&s;tructive of dome&s;tic felicity. The want of cordiality at home naturally leads us abroad, as the want of happine&s;s in our|&s;elves leads us to &s;eek it in externals, and to torture imagination for the gratifica|tion of appetites, which, undepraved, are &s;imple and uniform. New amu&s;ements, and &s;ocieties of plea&s;ure, were every day formed; new modes of di&s;&s;ipation were invented; the order of nature was chang|ed; night and day were inverted; and fancy and language were exhau&s;ted for names to the a&s;&s;emblies of politene&s;s and gallantry. Nothing is &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive as time to the unhappy, or thought to the
<PB N="110" REF="013650_0242_0F91A3B8F97C9938">vacant mind: the&s;e were not all enough They &s;eemed afraid of them&s;elves, and of each other. The hu&s;band had one &s;et of vi&s;itors, the wife another; he pro&s;ecuted his plea&s;ures abroad, &s;he entertained her friends at home; or re&s;orted to &s;ome place of public amu&s;ement, or private plea&s;ure. In a free country, it is un|pardonable in a man to accu&s;e his wife without evidence, or to pretend to abridge her liberty; and the guilty are &s;ilent for their own &s;akes. It was often morning before they met at their joyle&s;s home.</P>
<P>A &s;pirit of gaming, which mingled it|&s;elf with di&s;&s;ipation and plea&s;ure, afford|ed a new pretence for nocturnal meetings. Money lo&s;t at play mu&s;t be paid &s;ome|how; it is a debt of honour: and, to pre&s;erve family-peace, it is to be feared that women of virtuous principles have often &s;acrificed &s;omething more precious than their jewels. At any rate gaming di&s;covers the temper, ruffles the pa&s;&s;ions, corrupts the heart, and breaks down the &s;tronge&s;t barrier of virtue, &mdash; a decent re|&s;erve between the &s;exes.</P>

Love grew confident, as beauty became more acce&s;&s;ible; and the freedom of manners permitted the warme&s;t declara|tion without offence. The opportunities of gratification were infinite; the mo|tives of re&s;traint were few; and the temp|tations were many and great. A general ten&s;uality was the con&s;equence. Conju|gal in&s;idelity became common.</P>
<P>Men of &s;pirit obtained divorces. But the&s;e, in&s;tead of enforcing the obligation of the marriage-vow, by the fear of pub|lic &s;hame, appeared to have a quite con|trary effect; they only propagated weak|ne&s;s: the &s;educing example of human frailty remained, the odium was forgot; while the equity of the &s;entence was di&s;|puted, or its &s;everity blamed. Hu&s;bands were loudly accu&s;ed of libertini&s;m, and ju&s;tly of neglect. The women continu|ed to make repri&s;als, or make up their wants; the practice triumphed. Pru|dent men overlooked &s;uch liberties, when conducted with decency, which it mu&s;t be owned was &s;eldom violated; and good-natured hu&s;bands in general begin to
<PB N="112" REF="013650_0244_0F91A3BAB2550280">adopt a polite opinion, which will lea&s;t be conducive to a private peace viz. That a man is not more di&s;honour|ed by the AMOURS of his wife than by any other DEVIATION of ta&s;te, or than &s;he is by tho&s;e of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, unle&s;s manners take a turn, there is rea&s;on to belive that our Briti&s;h ladies, once &s;o remarkable for mode&s;ty, cha&s;tity, and conjugal fidelity, will &s;oon equal their &s;i&s;ters of France in impu|dence, levity, and incontinence; as we already rival our continental brethren in foppery, fal&s;hood, incon&s;tancy, vanity, &mdash;and in all their unmanly plea&s;ures, capricious appetites, and ema&s;culating luxuries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This character, in its full extent, mu&s;t only be applied to the court and the capital.

<P>But the fears of virtue are often groundle&s;s: fancy magnifies future evil,

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the general relaxation of manners, the aver&s;ion to whatever is &s;erious, the thir&s;t of admiration, and the neglect of e&s;teem, are at lea&s;t of tho&s;e qualities which produce it, there are in this age, in this i&s;land, and even in this city, women who would have done honour to any age or country; who join a refined ta&s;te and cultivated under|&s;tanding to a feeling heart, and who adorn their talents and their &s;en&s;ibility with &s;entiments of virtue, honour, and humanity. We have women who could

<P>We have &s;till wives, young, beautiful, and affectionate, who honour their vows, and in the mo&s;t delightful of human con|nections offer the mo&s;t enchanting &s;pec|tacle of innocence and love; who are not a&s;hamed to be mothers; who devote their happy hours to the tendere&s;t cares of nature; who watch with anxiety, who pre&s;s with tran&s;port, by turns, in their lovely arms, to their lips, and to

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>LET us not however, dream of mi|racles; nor conclude, from the virtues of individuals, that the man|ners of the age are pure, or the charac|ters of women in general re&s;pectable. Among a people where the &s;pirit of &s;o|ciety is carried &s;o far, as it is at pre&s;ent both in France and in England, the do|me&s;tic life mu&s;t be little known. All the &s;entiments of nature, which &s;pring up in retirement, and which are nur&s;ed in &s;o|litude, mu&s;t be weakened. The women mu&s;t therefore be le&s;s devoted to their original and mo&s;t important duties; they mu&s;t be le&s;s wives and mothers.</P>
<P>The manners now direct the preju|dices, as much as the prejudices for|merly directed the manners. The &s;acred attachments of love and friend&s;hip are exploded; they are bani&s;hed to the &s;hepherd and the &s;avage. Why? &mdash; Be|cau&s;e
<PB N="118" REF="013650_0250_0F91A3C2B835D4E0">they are unpolite: they &s;hew too great a preference; they pay to one, what is due to all.</P>
<P>The more the general tie extends, the more the particular ties are relaxed. We &s;eem to be attached to all the world, and we are attached to nobody. Hence the increa&s;e of di&s;&s;imulation and fal&s;hood. The le&s;s we feel, the more we appear to feel.</P>
<P>By a &s;trange contra&s;t, we are enrap|tured at the word SENTIMENT; &mdash; and all genuine &s;entiment is ridiculed. Per|haps we imagine, what we do not feel, does not exi&s;t; and, indeed, we &s;uffi|ciently vindicate our&s;elves from the im|putation of real &s;entiment, by the artful declamation which we &s;ub&s;titute in its place.</P>
<P>The word ROMANTIC was never &s;o much in u&s;e. This happy term affords a double fea&s;t to vanity: it excu&s;es e&s;teem, or ju&s;tifies contempt, to the virtues which we want; and it prevents &s;hame for the
<PB N="119" REF="013650_0251_0F91A3C3819ADBB0">vices or the weakne&s;&s;es which we have. It makes us content with our knowledge: we believe that we have e&s;timated all things; and that we &s;ee both what man is, and what he can be.</P>
<P>We talk a great deal about plea&s;ure, and we ta&s;te very little. The &s;oul preci|pitates it&s;elf upon its objects, when it &s;hould keep them at a certain di&s;tance; de&s;ire is gratified, before it can awake the divinity of pa&s;&s;ion; the &s;pell which en|chanted the mind is too &s;oon broke. Imagination turns cold, becau&s;e it has nothing to create; illu&s;ion vani&s;hes; &s;en&s;e grows dead. But what is &s;en&s;e, without pa&s;&s;ion and fancy?</P>
<P>The void which we experience, in con|&s;equence of fal&s;e plea&s;ure, and the want of energy in the &s;oul, mu&s;t have given birth to AMUSEMENT. the re&s;ource of cold hearts and empty heads; a word which is become important, and which mu&s;t be ridiculous to the &s;erious every time they u&s;e it; a word which implies
<PB N="120" REF="013650_0252_0F91A3C434EE27D8">what has no connection with virtue, and none perhaps with the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>That amu&s;ement, that inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;omething, which is neither imagination, rea&s;on, nor pa&s;&s;ion, and which con&s;i&s;ts principally in forms, being the univer&s;al ta&s;te, all things mu&s;t comply with it. The accompli&s;hments are &s;uppo&s;ed vir|tues, and the vices are pardoned. Al|mo&s;t nobody has the boldne&s;s to cen&s;ure guilt, when it wears the habit of the Graces. The mind is contracted; the heart is &s;hut; and attention is bu&s;ied a|bout trifles. To plea&s;e or to di&s;plea&s;e are become the great words of language.</P>
<P>As we are continually under ob&s;erva|tion, &s;elf-love, by being more rou&s;ed, mu&s;t be more keen; but the &s;ame &s;pirit which rou&s;es it, likeways re&s;trains it. It is curbed, and it is &s;timulated; its &s;ecret is rather veiled than hid, &mdash; and yet is &s;e|cure. The eyes of vanity are ob&s;cured by a mi&s;t, and the mutual feeling is willing to &s;eem blind. Society is a &s;encing &s;chool or field of combat, where &s;elf-love en|counters
<PB N="121" REF="013650_0253_0F91A3C506948260">&s;elf-love, and where each are de&s;irous to conquer without the air of e|mulation: they di&s;gui&s;e their efforts, that their preten&s;ions may not be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>From this a&s;&s;emblage of folly, vanity, and fal&s;hood, mu&s;t &s;pring a re&s;tle&s;s levity in the commerce of the &s;exes, and a &s;e|rious and bu&s;y mockery of pa&s;&s;ion. But what above all characteri&s;es the manners of the pre&s;ent age, is the madne&s;s of &s;hew; the frenzy of &s;acrificing every thing to appearance; the importance a&s;|&s;igned to little duties, and the value &s;et upon little objects. We talk gravely of the trifles of to-day, and of tho&s;e of to|morrow. The &s;oul has a languid, and never &s;atisfied activity, which expands it over a thou&s;and objects without intere&s;t|ing it in one, and which communicates motion without impul&s;e.</P>
<P>But if a ta&s;te for letters, and a deli|rium of talents, mingle with the giddi|ne&s;s of &s;ociety, from &s;uch a combination mu&s;t re&s;ult other effects. Then a ge|neral pa&s;&s;ion of appearing informed mu&s;t
<PB N="122" REF="013650_0254_0F91A3C8650A3168">prevail, without the time, or the trouble to be &s;o; then we mu&s;t &s;ee a torrent of &s;uperficial knowledge, and a crowd of half-learned pretenders to &s;cience; a multitude of philo&s;ophical ideas, which men of genius throw out in retirement, and which are greedily &s;eized by people of fa&s;hion, di&s;puted, repeated, and &s;cat|tered in polite circles; light conver&s;a|tions on profound &s;ubjects; the laws of genius &s;ettled, and a genius of memory, when we have nothing original; the e&s;tabli&s;hment and the oppo&s;ition of lite|rary &s;ocieties; preten&s;ions of all kinds, and of all denominations; bold preten|&s;ions, cool and high preten&s;ions, and cautious preten&s;ions, with a mixture of re&s;erve; the fury of reputation, oftener u&s;urped than real; intrigue, flattery, and little arts to obtain it; in &s;hort, the art of prai&s;ing, to be prai&s;ed; the art of joining foreign merit to our own, and of procuring renown either by our&s;elves or by others.</P>
<P>As the general &s;y&s;tem of luminaries is greater, and as they communicate their
<PB N="123" REF="013650_0255_0F91A3CA51DAD8B8">influence more fully by motion, the wo|men, without giving them&s;elves any trou|ble, mu&s;t be more enlightened. But, faithful to their plan, they only covet knowledge as an ornament to the mind, as jewels are to the per&s;on. They &s;tudy the arts rather from a de&s;ire to plea&s;e, than a de&s;ire to know, or from the plea|&s;ure of learning; and they read more for amu&s;ement, than for in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, in a &s;tate of &s;ociety where the motion is rapid, and where there is an eternal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects and ideas, the women, con&s;tantly occupied in fol|lowing the &s;cene, which changes and flies ince&s;&s;antly round them, mu&s;t know better the ideas of the pre&s;ent, than of pa&s;t times, and tho&s;e which are fa&s;hionable than tho&s;e which are ju&s;t. They mu&s;t therefore be better acquainted with the language of the arts than wich their prin|ciples, and have more unconnected ideas than u&s;eful or &s;y&s;tematic knowledge.</P>
<P>It might perhaps be thought curious now to examine, what mu&s;t be the con|&s;equence
<PB N="124" REF="013650_0256_0F91A3CB764591E8">of &s;uch a mixture of ideas and manners, of levity and learning, of phi|lo&s;ophy in the head, and libertini&s;m in the heart: that however is too &s;elf-evi|dent to afford room for much di&s;qui&s;ition. It might likewi&s;e perhaps be thought cu|rious, to compare the characters of wo|men, as they at pre&s;ent exi&s;t in London, and in Paris, with tho&s;e which they have had in different periods, and which they now have in different countries; with their &s;weet mode&s;ty in many parts of England; with their timid re&s;erve in Scotland; with their tamene&s;s and want of pa&s;&s;ion in Holland; with their mix|ture of devotion and &s;en&s;uality in Italy; with their warm imagination and keen &s;en&s;ibility in Spain; with their profound retirement in China, where they have been &s;eparated during four thou&s;and years from the intercour&s;e of men; in &s;hort, with the character and the manners which mu&s;t re&s;ult from their confinement in Turky, in Per&s;ia, and over almo&s;t all A&s;ia, where they only exi&s;t for one man; where they can neither cultivate their character nor their rea&s;on; and, de&s;|tined
<PB N="125" REF="013650_0257_0F91A3CBC6224060">to have only &s;en&s;es, where they are forced by the ab&s;urdity of their condition to join mode&s;ty to wantonne&s;s, and co|quetry to retirement:&mdash;But, to complete &s;uch a parallel, it is &s;ufficient to have hinted it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore only ob&s;erve, that in the pre&s;ent age there are fewer panegy|rics on women than in any former pe|riod. The poets &s;eem to have lo&s;t that delicate gallantry which was &s;o long their character. They are either Cynics or voluptuaries. The prevailing ta&s;te for women, indeed, which is neither love, nor pa&s;&s;ion, nor even gallantry, but the cold and barren effect of a habit of &s;en|&s;uality, can neither rou&s;e imagination nor &s;entiment. In our numerous and growing a&s;&s;emblies, in the eternal round of di&s;&s;ipation and amu&s;ement, where the &s;exes mingle with freedom, we learn to admire le&s;s, becau&s;e we learn to be more &s;evere. Self-love, judge and rival, &s;ome|times indulgent through pride, but always cruel from jealou&s;y, was never more vigilant in &s;pying faults, or &s;owing ridi|cule.
<PB N="126" REF="013650_0258_0F91A3CC8BB79688">Prai&s;e is the re&s;ult of enthu&s;ia&s;tic pa&s;&s;ion; and never was there an age in which there was le&s;s than in this, though perhaps we affect more than our prede|ce&s;&s;ors. Enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;prings from a warm imagination, which creates objects in place of &s;eeing them, and which heightens what it has &s;een. At pre&s;ent we &s;ee too much; in con&s;equence of which we feel too little. Beauty obtrudes it&s;elf on the view: its &s;pots are too vi&s;ible; pa&s;&s;ion is di&s;gu&s;ted; and fancy &s;ickens for want of exerci&s;e. Female delicacy is lo&s;t. Vice is ranked in the number of our ac|compli&s;hments. The le&s;s we e&s;teem the women, the more we pretend to know them:&mdash;and they at pre&s;ent make &s;uch a language nece&s;&s;ary. Every boy has more pride than to &s;eem acquainted only with their virtues; and would be rakes, who&s;e experience really reaches no further, that they may &s;upport a reputation with the &s;ex, accu&s;e them of more than human weakne&s;s, by contemptibly a&s;&s;uming a knowledge and a character to which they have no right.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="013650_0259_0F91A3CD55921458">
Such, with regard to women, is the influence of that general &s;pirit of &s;ociety which they have in&s;pired, and of which they do not fail to boa&s;t. They are like ea&s;tern monarchs, who are never more honoured than when they are lea&s;t &s;een: by di&s;covering them&s;elves too freely to their &s;ubjects, they have encouraged them to revolt.</P>
<P>But, lea&s;t the ladies &s;hould take offence at being compared to tyrants, I will give them a gentler &s;imile; which I &s;hall in|troduce with a &s;hort analy&s;is of female &s;ociety, as it progre&s;&s;es in countries where the &s;oft affections exerci&s;e their &s;weete&s;t influence. &mdash; In a &s;tate of nature, the company of women is little de&s;ired; their beauties are unveiled to every eye; and their favours are be&s;towed without courting. In the early periods of &s;ocie|ty, they are principally valued on account of their utility; their condition ap|proaches to &s;ervitude; and little delicacy is ob&s;erved in the commerce of love. As &s;ociety advances, they are prized as objects of plea&s;ure: con&s;cious of their

Love grows jealous, and beauty undergoes a degree of re&s;traint. But as the mind opens, and when &s;ociety is better under|&s;tood, &s;uch re&s;traint is thought unju&s;t &mdash; ungenerous to the partners of our dear|e&s;t intere&s;ts, our &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ures! &mdash; and incon&s;i&s;tent with that confidence which is due to love, to virtue, to man|kind, and which is e&s;&s;ential to our own peace. The freedom of nature is re|&s;tored, within the pale of &s;ociety. Beau|ty becomes more brilliant, more alluring, &mdash; but le&s;s engaging. Man cea&s;es to adore what is familiar to his eye. Like her emblematic flower, the &s;ame &s;un that beholds the glory of woman may be &s;aid to be witne&s;s to her di&s;grace: her na|ture is too delicate to &s;upport the beams of general admiration; &s;he opens her attractions too fully to the heart; &s;he yields too freely her &s;weetne&s;s to the breath of prai&s;e; and, if &s;he does not &s;ink into her original neglect, &s;he ex|periences a fate little more to be envied;
<PB N="129" REF="013650_0261_0F91A3CEC0764558">&s;he is rudely pluckt by every &s;poiler; and, when her virtues are evaporat|ed, the pride of creation is viewed with contempt.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore conclude with advi|&s;ing the gentle &s;ex, to leave a remnant of authority in the hands of the men, and to keep a little re&s;erve in their own; as the be&s;t means of &s;ecuring the hearts of tho&s;e they love, and the e&s;teem of &s;uch as de&s;erve it.</P>
