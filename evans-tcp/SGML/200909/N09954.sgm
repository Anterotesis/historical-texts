<HEAD>A Vindication of the &s;overeign Decrees of God.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Beloved Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHOUGH we &s;hould endeavour to avoid all needle&s;s contention, yet the <HI>faith once delivered to the &s;aints,</HI> is &s;ometimes treated in &s;uch a manner, as to make it our incumbent duty, <HI>earne&s;tly</HI> and publickly to <HI>contend for it.</HI> Such a ca&s;e I think is pre&s;ented before us, by means of a printed paper lately &s;pread in Providence, and towns adjacent, which you have reque&s;ted me to make &s;ome remarks upon. It begins in this manner.</P>
<P><Q><HI>On Traditionary Zeal.</HI> Some good chri&s;tian pa&s;tors will not &s;cruple to tell you, that they could find no joy in their own &s;tate, no &s;trength or com|fort in their labours of love towards their flocks, but becau&s;e they <HI>know, and are a&s;&s;ured,</HI> from St. Paul, that God never had, nor ever will have, <HI>mercy up|on all men;</HI> but that an unknown multitude of them are, through all ages of the world, inevitably decreed to the eternal fire and damnation of hell: and that an unknown number of others are elected to a certain, irre&s;i&s;tible &s;alvation. Wonder not, my friends, if the <HI>inqui&s;ition</HI> has its pious defenders: For inqui&s;ition cruelty, and every barbarity that mu&s;t have an end, <HI>is mere mercy,</HI> if compared with this reprobation doctrine. And to be in love with
<PB N="4" REF="012656_0003_0F8BBE2507EE4218">it, to draw &s;weet comfort from it, and to wi&s;h it God-&s;peed, is a love that ab&s;olutely forbids the lov|ing our neighbour as our&s;elves, and makes the &s;crip|ture-wi&s;h, <HI>that all men might be &s;aved,</HI> no le&s;s than a rebellion again&s;t God.</Q></P>
<P>This writer's evident de&s;ign, is again&s;t the doctrine of particular election, and efficacious grace in our &s;al|vation, and again&s;t tho&s;e who preach it: And he takes the &s;ame method that the heathen per&s;ecutors did with the primitive chri&s;tians, viz. To cover them with &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts, in order that they might be devoured by dogs, or if not, yet that they might be hated and avoided by all men. He a&s;&s;erts that &s;ome chri&s;tian pe&s;tors tell their people &s;uch a &s;tory as he has here related; if he can find any man upon earth that teaches &s;o, he is welcome to correct him as much as he de&s;erves; but till he exhibits his proof, he ought to be accounted a bla&s;phemer of God's &s;o|vereignty, and a fal&s;e-accu&s;er of Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters. Yea, out of his own mouth he is condemned; for as &s;hort as his paper is, he has not been able to keep to one con&s;i&s;tent &s;tory, but the &s;ame preachers that he accu&s;es of rejoicing that God never will have mercy upon all men, when he comes to give us their own language, it is, "O the &s;weetne&s;s of God's election!" And neither the devil nor any of his children, will ever be able to make a rejoicing in God's <HI>everla&s;ting love to a cho&s;en number,</HI> to be the &s;ame thing, as it would be to rejoice in the de&s;truction of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Our Lord &s;ays, <HI>Every one that doth evil, bateth the light; but he that doth truth, cometh to the light;</HI> and let the reader judge which of the&s;e cha|racters &s;uits the conduct of the writer before us. He ca&s;ts out the&s;e horrid accu&s;ations again&s;t &s;ome good
<PB N="5" REF="012656_0004_0F8BBE25E6029358">chri&s;tian pa&s;tors, without naming any one, while his evident aim is again&s;t all that profe&s;s a &s;weetne&s;s in &s;overeign election; at the &s;ame time (like the Savages) he tries to keep him&s;elf and his principles hid.&mdash; Though it fares with him as it did with the old ene|mies of the <HI>&s;ure foundation</HI> which God has <HI>laid in Zion;</HI> who&s;e bed was &s;horter than that a man could &s;tretch him&s;elf upon it, and the covering narrower than that he could wrap him&s;elf in it, I&s;a. 28. For though by the title of his piece he would have peo|ple e&s;teem him, as a bold champion again&s;t <HI>tradition,</HI> and a friend to Paul, and the &s;acred <HI>writings;</HI> yet he does not &s;o much as attempt to prove, that &s;ove|reign decrees, and irre&s;i&s;table grace, are not fully taught by them. No, in&s;tead of confuting us, or de|&s;ending him&s;elf, by the &s;acred oracles, he, like tho&s;e who prophe&s;ied out of the <HI>deceit of their own hearts,</HI> fir&s;t makes his addre&s;s to mens pa&s;&s;ions, and exerts all his art to bring up the horrid ideas, of an inevita|ble decreeing of multitudes to hell fire; of cruelty va&s;tly wor&s;e than the <HI>inqui&s;ition;</HI> of God's &s;acrify&s;ing of myriads of his creatures to the devil, &amp;c. and hav|ing done his utmo&s;t thus to rai&s;e a tempe&s;t in the &s;ouls of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> he winds up by a&s;&s;erting that, <Q>The only po&s;&s;ible way of avoiding every prevailing er|ror, and of finding every &s;aving truth, is to li&s;ten, &s;olemnly, attentively to li&s;ten, agreeable to the written word, to the <HI>&s;till &s;mall voice within you.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is ju&s;t like the old &s;erpent, who with malici|ous reflections upon God's government, and lying pretences of friend&s;hip to man, drew him into rebel|lion again&s;t God's <HI>revealed will,</HI> and to gratify his own <HI>heart's lu&s;ts.</HI> Yet from that day to this, when the tempter thinks it will &s;erve his turn, he is very ready to catch at &s;ome &s;cripture <HI>words,</HI> to intice
<PB N="6" REF="012656_0005_0F8BBE26492EDC50">people into violations of the <HI>truth</HI> which is therein taught.</P>
<P>Let the pretended advocate for truth now before us, mean what he will by the <HI>voice within,</HI> yet when he or any others are brought &s;olemnly and attentively to li&s;ten, either to rea&s;on, con&s;cience, or the Spirit of God, they will teach them, that the way to avoid error, and to find the truth in any ca&s;e, is not fir&s;t to inflame our pa&s;&s;ions before our judgments are well informed. No, for a gift will blind the eyes of the wi&s;e, and pervert the words of the righteous; there|fore we mu&s;t have our eye &s;ingle, or el&s;e our <HI>whole</HI> body will be <HI>full of darkne&s;s.</HI> Hence appears the nece&s;&s;ity of the holy Spirit, to renew us in the &s;pirit of our minds, and to guide our &s;ouls into all truth.</P>
<P>The grand conte&s;t ever &s;ince &s;in entred into the world, has been between the will of the Creator, and the will of the creature; but as it is too &s;hocking for human nature to have it openly appear in that light, God's enemies in all ages, have <HI>made lies their re|fuge, and under fal&s;hood have hid them&s;elves.</HI> And in the controver&s;y before us, we may take notice of the following refuges of lies, which the enemies of &s;overeign grace try to hide them&s;elves in.</P>
<P N="1">1. As the &s;acred writers often appealed to mens rea&s;on and con&s;cience, and exhorted the &s;aints to re|gard the teachings of the holy Spirit in their &s;ouls, above all human authority on earth, deceivers of va|rious denominations have catcht at, and perverted that &s;acred cu&s;tom, as a plea for &s;etting up a &s;tandard <HI>in them&s;elves</HI> to decide every ca&s;e, &s;o as not to admit any thing for truth that does not agree with their <HI>in|ward te&s;t.</HI> But it is well known in our nation, that in order for us to enjoy our ju&s;t rights and liberties,
<PB N="7" REF="012656_0006_0F8BBE27104AF988">rulers as well as &s;ubjects mu&s;t be governed by known laws and e&s;tabli&s;hed rules; and that for judges to a&s;&s;ume a di&s;cretionary power to di&s;pen&s;e with old laws, or to make new ones as occa&s;ion &s;erved, would introduce arbitrary government, or rather a cruel ty|nanny. And were not people deluded with the re|ligious names, and great &s;welling words of deceivers, all their attempts to &s;et up a <HI>voice within,</HI> which &s;peaks in any re&s;pects contrary to God's <HI>written word,</HI> would appear as arbitrary and tyrannical as any &s;uch proceedings of earthly judges can be. Tho&s;e holy men whom God employed to write his word, had their authority &s;o to do <HI>confirmed by divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and wo to that man who pre&s;umes either to add to, or take from tho&s;e holy oracles.</P>
<P N="2">2. The advocates for their own free-will in oppo|&s;ition to &s;overeign grace, have determined that the doctrine of fixed decrees in the divine mind concern|ing the future &s;tate of men, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the liberty of their own wills, and with the proper influ|ence of precepts and promi&s;es, rewards and puni&s;h|ments; and having quoted a number of precepts, with con&s;iderations to enforce them, (of which the Bible is full) they boa&s;t that they have gained their argument, when in truth they have never touched the point in debate. We know and as firmly hold as any free-willer on earth, that all men are under moral go|vernment, where precepts and promi&s;es, exhortations, warnings, &amp;c. have their proper place, and ought to influence us in all our conduct; and I believe from the bottom of my heart, that God never did nor ever will puni&s;h any but the guilty, and that he will finally reward every man according to his works. But in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, the true &s;tate of the que&s;tion
<PB N="8" REF="012656_0007_0F8BBE27DAA39098">is this, viz. Whether the whole plan of God's go|vernment, and the final i&s;&s;ue of every action through the univer&s;e, has not been known and fixed in his coun&s;els from the beginning, &s;o that <HI>nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it?</HI> Eccl. 3.14. Or whether many events are not held in &s;u&s;pence and uncertainty in his infinite mind, till they are decidedby the free-will power of men? We hold the fir&s;t, they the la&s;t &s;ide of this que&s;tion. But in&s;tead of attending to the true &s;tate of the controver&s;y, and in&s;tead of re|ferring the deci&s;ion of it to the divine oracles, <HI>tradi|tion</HI> and <HI>corruption</HI> has carried them into the way which this writer per&s;ues, of repre&s;enting our doctrine to be, that God decrees &s;ome men to mi&s;ery in the &s;ame manner that he does others to happine&s;s; yea this &s;landerer, in imitation of tho&s;e who have gone before him, &s;ets reprobation foremo&s;t, and would have people believe that we hold, God's fir&s;t de&s;ign to be the damnation of <HI>multitudes,</HI> and then &s;econdly, the <HI>irre&s;i&s;table &s;alvation</HI> of a <HI>number!</HI> Hoping no doubt by the&s;e horrid colourings, to guard people &s;ufficiently again&s;t all the go&s;pel weapons, which are appointed to pull down the &s;trong holds that are rai&s;ed <HI>against the knowledge of God,</HI> and to ca&s;t down the <HI>imaginations</HI> which keep mens <HI>thoughts too high</HI> to yield their all to a meek and lowly Je&s;us, 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. Many in latter ages have carried their imaginations &s;o high on this &s;ubject, as,</P>
<P N="3">3. To a&s;&s;ume a dignity to them&s;elves, that they will not allow to the eternal God; for they claim a <HI>&s;elf|determining power</HI> in their own wills, while they deny it to the Mo&s;t High; and in&s;i&s;t upon it, that his choice of &s;ome men to &s;alvation rather than others, is from either a fore&s;ight, or after&s;ight, of good di&s;|po&s;itions and good doings in them more than others;
<PB N="9" REF="012656_0008_0F8BBE289F45D430">&s;o making that to be the cau&s;e of his choice, which he declares is the effect of it, and repre&s;enting that God is influenced in his works by motives <HI>without</HI> him&s;elf, at the &s;ame time that they hold to a power to determine all their own actions <HI>within</HI> them&s;elves. Can any imaginations ever be entertained, more ab|&s;urd, or more contrary to holy writ, than the&s;e are! See Mat. 11.25&mdash;28. Rom. 8.29, 30. Eph. 1.4, 5. 1 Pet. 1.2. 1 Joh. 4.19.</P>
<P>The people we are now &s;peaking of commonly deny the doctrine of mans univer&s;al depravity, but if to claim a &s;overeignty to their own wills, while they deny it to God, does not prove them to be rebels a|gain&s;t heaven, I know not what can do it.</P>
<P>Nebuchadnezzar made trial how it would do to a&s;cribe all his atchievments to him&s;elf; but after he had grazed among the bea&s;ts of the field till &s;even times had pa&s;&s;ed over him, he declares that, <Q>All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as <HI>nothing</HI> (before the Mo&s;t High) and he doth according to HIS WILL in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, what do&s;t thou?</Q> Dan. 4.35. Thus it appears that the hearts of kings are in the hand of the Lord, &s;o that <HI>as rivers of water he turneth them whither&s;oever he will.</HI> i. e. to act volun|tarily as he de&s;igns to have them. From whence it appears evident, that there is no incon&s;i&s;tency in hold|ing God's decrees to be immutable, and yet that men act as voluntarily as if it were not &s;o. And the great rea&s;oners on the other &s;ide cannot avoid this con&s;e|quence, if they would once own that the will of man is always determined in it's choice by motive, or by what they at pre&s;ent prefer and think to be be&s;t; for
<PB N="10" REF="012656_0009_0F8BBE2B082AE1A0">that per&s;on mu&s;t be &s;tupid indeed who cannot &s;ee, that HE in whom we live, move and have our be|ing, can at any time &s;et things in &s;uch a view before our minds, as to make us think it be&s;t to cho&s;e one way of acting rather than another. Though Balaam was &s;o madly &s;et after the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, that he <HI>would</HI> not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> even by the reproof of a dumb a&s;s, yet when the Lord opened his eyes to &s;ee the angel with a drawn &s;word before him, he at once chu&s;e to fall to the earth, or to turn back, rather than run upon it. Num. 22.31, &amp;c. In order there|fore to keep up their conceit that fixed decrees interfere with men's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;ome of their great doctors have,</P>
<P N="4">4. Tried to &s;helter them&s;elves in &s;uch a mi&s;erable refuge as to pretend, that they have a power in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to act <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> motive</HI> or <HI>again&s;t motive,</HI> ju&s;t as the will plea&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">. But I &s;uppo&s;e it is as great a piece of non&s;en&s;e, in it&s;elf, to hold that a rational &s;oul can act voluntarily in any ca&s;e, without of again&s;t motive, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> would be to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">. There can be a rational action without any influence of rea&s;on in it! Thus profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be wi&s;e they become fools; for as Mr. Locke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;erves, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> per&s;ons are in|fluenced by rea&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> rea&s;on from wrong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">. As when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> man imagines that he is all made of gla&s;s, he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to act with the caution that would be nece&s;&s;ary if the ca&s;e were &s;o; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> may be &s;aid of other imaginations; and per&s;ons mu&s;t be idiots, and not rea&s;on at all, or e&s;&s;e rea&s;on and motive, will always Influence their choice and conduct. Evil <HI>imaginations</HI> and <HI>thoughts,</HI> always move men to act wickedly, Gen 6.5. and 8.21&mdash; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> when any are brought to <HI>know the truth, it makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> free from &s;in,</HI> &s;o as to <HI>become Jervants of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Joh. 8.32. Rom. 6.18.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="012656_0010_0F8BBE2B85A02F80">
Hence it appears evident, that they and not we, would exclude the the u&s;efulne&s;s of means; for if the liberty of man lay in acting again&s;t motive or with motive, ju&s;t as they plea&s;ed, where could there be any proper u&s;e for means? For the very de&s;ign of go&s;pel means, is to turn &s;ouls from evil, to follow that which is good; and if their liberty con&s;i&s;ted in not being moved and governed by means and mo|tives, there would be no &s;en&s;e in u&s;ing of them; but like &s;moke and vapour men mu&s;t be left to act ju&s;t that way the wind happens to blow. In &s;hort, the main objections I ever heard again&s;t &s;overeign election, and certain &s;alvation by free grace alone, appear to me to &s;pring from this root, viz. Man who was flat|tered with the notion of being <HI>as gods,</HI> &s;till conceits that he has a power <HI>in him&s;elf</HI> to do as he plea&s;es, let that plea&s;ure be to comply with, or to di&s;appoint God's de&s;igns; and therefore if they are not di&s;po&s;ed at pre|&s;ent to engage in his &s;ervice, that he mu&s;t wait their lei&s;ure, and be ready whenever they &s;et about the work in good earne&s;t, to grant them the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his grace, and if they improve it well unto the end, then to receive them to his glory. But for my part I have no more notion of wor&s;hipping a deity that can po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;taken or di&s;appointed in any one event, than I have of wor&s;hipping Baal, who could not defend either his altar or grove, when his votaries were a&s;leep, Judges 6.31.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are determined to believe nothing but what they can comprehend, are determined to be ido|lators; for tis certain that any thing which can be comprehended by a finite mind, cannot be the infi|nite Jehovah; who&s;e wi&s;dom, knowledge and judg|ments are <HI>un&s;earchable,</HI> and his ways <HI>pa&s;t finding out; of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things;
<PB N="12" REF="012656_0011_0F8BBE2CABD2C000">to whom be glory for ever, amen.</HI> Rom. 11.33&mdash;36. Thus to believe, adore and obey, is not as many would have it, a &s;acrificing of rea&s;on to tradition and blind devotion, but the contrary. As for in&s;tance, &s;hould any man conceit that he could not know whe|ther or not there was light in the &s;un, or warmth in the fire, without looking through the one and running into the other, and &s;hould try the experiment till he became blind and burnt; he could not from thence convince me that I had lo&s;t both my &s;ight and feeling, becau&s;e I &s;till profe&s;&s;ed to enjoy great comfort in the cautious improvement of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings. Now the perfections of the deity are compared both to the &s;un and the fire, to teach us the importance of receiving his grace freely, of acting towards him <HI>uprightly,</HI> and <HI>&s;erving</HI> of him with <HI>reverence and godly fear,</HI> P&s;al. 84. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> 1. Heb. 12.28, 29.</P>
<P>Some &s;erious per&s;ons are afraid to give in to the doctrine of immutable decrees, le&s;t they &s;hould make God the author of &s;in; but Mr. Norton, one of the fathers of this country, ju&s;tly replied to this objection, That &s;in is a <HI>defect,</HI> and God is the author of all effi|ciency, but not of any defect at all. An illegitimate child is the creature of God, but its illegitimacy is wholly from its parents. It was their lo&s;ts which cau&s;ed the <HI>defect</HI> or want of its being lawfully begot|ten; yet the child is God's creature, and if he plea&s;e he makes it a &s;ubject of his grace. The heat of the &s;un that attracts the &s;ecret virtues of the earth, is not the cau&s;e of the &s;tink of the dughill. And though carnal rea&s;oners try to per&s;uade people, that to hold every event to be certain in the divide councils, takes away the guilt of evil actions, and the virtue of good ones, yet the word of truth abundantly &s;hews the con|trary. It &s;hews that Jo&s;eph's brethren were as <HI>verily
<PB N="13" REF="012656_0012_0F8BBE2D496BE938">guilty</HI> in their actings again&s;t him, as if they could have fru&s;trated God's de&s;ign; and yet that he over|tuled their <HI>wrath</HI> and <HI>cruelty</HI> towards their brother, for his own <HI>prai&s;e,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 76.10.</NOTE> and to make Jo&s;eph much more of a public and exten&s;ive ble&s;&s;ing, than they could have made him in Canaan, if they had tried their ut|termo&s;t for it. At the &s;ame time the &s;acred &s;tory clearly &s;hews, that they acted quite voluntarily, both in their wretched abu&s;es to their brother, and in hum|bly pro&s;trating them&s;elves before him afterward.&mdash; They acted by motive; when they fir&s;t &s;aw Jo&s;eph coming to them, they felt &s;o that they thought they would &s;lay him: But upon another view murder ap|peared &s;o &s;hocking that they thought it be&s;t to gra|tify them&s;elves another way, which moved them to chu&s;e that way. On the other hand, when Jo&s;eph was tempted by his wicked mi&s;tre&s;s, though men were ab&s;ent, yet God to whom be was under infinite obligation, was pre&s;ent to his thoughts, and that prov|ed a &s;ufficient motive to make him chu&s;e any &s;uffer|ing rather than to &s;in again&s;t &s;uch a glorious being.</P>
<P>The inquiry and pur&s;uit of all men is after <HI>good,</HI> and the believer finds it only in God, who is <HI>good,</HI> and is always doing <HI>good,</HI> and this cau&s;es his &s;oul to be in earne&s;t to <HI>learn his &s;tatutes,</HI> P&s;al. 4.6, 7, and 119.68. Others do not like to retain the true God in their knowledge; neither his nature nor his go|vernment appear good to their carnal minds, there|fore they wor&s;hip and &s;erve the creature in&s;tead of the Creator; &s;etting up gain, honor or plea&s;ure, as their chief good. Yet to appear nakedly irreligious, is too &s;hocking to multitudes, who at the &s;ame time are very far from de&s;iring to &s;et the Lord always before them, &s;o as to be influenced by him in all their con|duct;

Zech. 11.17.</P>
<P>A darling topick with the carnal rea&s;oners of our world is this; they &s;ay, That either men are <HI>able</HI> to obey and &s;erve God, or el&s;e if they <HI>cannot</HI> do it, they are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> blame for neglecting of it, until God is plea|&s;ed to convert them. But the truth is, the natural man <HI>cannot &s;erve God</HI> becau&s;e he does <HI>love</HI> and <HI>&s;erve</HI> an i|dol: And the &s;oul before it is &s;lain by the law, <HI>cannot</HI> be <HI>married</HI> to Chri&s;t, becau&s;e it is <HI>wedded</HI> to its own doings, Mat. 6.24. Rom. 7. Yet this inability is &s;o far from being any ju&s;t excu&s;e, that the more unable they are to love God, or to believe in Chri&s;t, the greater is their <HI>condemnation,</HI> Joh. 3.16,&mdash;19. And it is a mo&s;t wicked device in the writer of the paper now in hand, to u&s;e the word <HI>inevitable</HI> concerning the reprobate, and <HI>irre&s;i&s;table</HI> concerning the elect, in &s;uch a manner as to exclude the idea of their own choice; whereas the ve&s;&s;els of wrath &s;ay, <HI>We</HI> WILL <HI>walk after our own devices;</HI> and EVERY ONE <HI>that doth evil,</HI> HATETH THE LIGHT, Jer. 18. 12. Joh. 3.20. And ve&s;&s;els of mercy per&s;ue the &s;ame ways, till God works in them to <HI>will and to do of his good plea&s;ure,</HI> Phil. 2.13. Tit. 3.3,&mdash;5.&mdash; Therefore though the final event is as certain to the one as the other, yet the manner of its accompli&s;h|ment is va&s;tly different. The ve&s;&s;els of wrath, <HI>after their hard and impenitent heart, trea&s;ure up wrath</HI> TO THEMSELVES; while God <HI>endureth with much long &s;uffering</HI> with them. But he <HI>makes known</HI> the riches of his glory, in effectually <HI>calling the ve&s;&s;els of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory.</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="012656_0014_0F8BBE32C304F6E8">Rom. 2 5. and 9.22,&mdash;24. And renewed &s;ouls are &s;o far from a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves a power to be God's <HI>coun&s;ellors,</HI> or venturing to act upon <HI>&s;ecret things which belong to him,</HI> that where he has told them of his de&s;igns concerning any future event, they have not made the de&s;ign of the great Ruler, but the laws he has given to his &s;ubjects, the rule of their conduct; and the difference between &s;ubjects and rebels is di&s;|covered by this. As for in&s;tance, God let David know that he de&s;igned to remove Saul, and to make him king in his &s;tead. Yet David refu&s;ed to &s;mite Saul when he had opportunity, but le&s;t it with God to remove him in his own way, 1 Sam 24.12, 13. Whereas when the Jews heard Caiphas prophecy con|cerning the death of Je&s;us, <HI>from that day forth, they took coun&s;el together for to put him to death,</HI> Joh. 11.49, 53. And God's accompli&s;hing his infallible de|crees in that great event, while the Jews were inex|cu&s;ably guilty in their actings about it, are &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted by the in&s;pired apo&s;tle. <HI>Him, being delivered by the</HI> DETERMINATE COUNSEL <HI>and fore|knowledge of God, ye have taken and by</HI> WICKED HANDS <HI>have crucified and &s;lain,</HI> Act. 2.23.</P>
<P>They acted mo&s;t wickedly in con&s;piring again&s;t our Savior, who was perfectly holy and harmle&s;s, and con&s;tantly went about doing good; yet God's pur|po&s;es and promi&s;es were thereby exactly accompli&s;h|ed, in be&s;towing infinite and eternal mercies upon guilty and mi&s;erable men. Pharaoh u&s;ed great &s;ub|tilty and cruelty in order to keep I&s;rael in bondage, and &s;et up his <HI>will</HI> at the highe&s;t rate again&s;t relea&s;ing of them; yet God in his providence cau&s;ed things to appear &s;o to him and his &s;ubjects, that they volun|tarily furni&s;hed I&s;rael with &s;ilver and gold, and <HI>Egypt was glad when they departed,</HI> P&s;al. 105 37, 38. and that on the <HI>&s;elf &s;ame day</HI> which God had told Abraham

<P>The&s;e and many other in&s;tances of mens voluntary actions the Lord declared with a perfect exactne&s;s be|fore they came to pa&s;s, becau&s;e he <HI>knew</HI> that with a <HI>brazen ob&s;tinacy,</HI> and <HI>wilful treachery,</HI> they would rather give this <HI>glory</HI> to their <HI>idol</HI> than to him, I&s;ai. 48.3,&mdash;8. But the firm faith of the &s;aints in every age, in the certain accompli&s;hment of God's promi&s;es, has made them the more watchful and active in the rational choice and u&s;e of the be&s;t means that he fur|ni&s;hed them with for attaining the de&s;ired end. Jacob wre&s;tled and prevailed with God, yet that did not make him neglect means, but he wi&s;ely improved the be&s;t that he had in his power, to calm his angry bro|ther, and it had the de&s;ired effect. Paul <HI>believed God</HI> that the lives of all tho&s;e who were with him in the &s;hip &s;hould be &s;aved; yet when the men who were killed in managing the &s;hip were about to leave it, he &s;aid to the centurion, and to the &s;oldiers, <HI>Except the&s;e abide in the &s;hip, ye</HI> CANNOT <HI>be &s;aved,</HI> Acts 27.25, 31. Here was a certainty of the event, and yet it is expre&s;&s;ed conditionally, while both were true; it was true that all &s;hould be &s;aved, and it was as true that the mariners mu&s;t be in&s;trumental of it.</P>
<P>Thus my dear friend, I have endeavoured in as plain and brief a manner as I could, in the little time I had for it, opened and vindicated the great &s;crip|ture doctrine of God's &s;overeign decrees, again&s;t a malicious attempt which has been made to vilify the &s;ame. It may well &s;eem &s;urprizing to tho&s;e who are acquainted with the 17th article of the church of England, to hear that a mini&s;ter who has &s;olemnly engaged to maintain the truth therein expre&s;&s;ed, &s;hould have a great hand in &s;preading this bla&s;phe|mous paper which is diametrically contrary thereto, as has evidently been the ca&s;e. But I leave him and all others in the hand of a righteous and gracious God, and re&s;t,</P>
