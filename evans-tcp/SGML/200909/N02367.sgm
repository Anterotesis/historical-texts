<HEAD>To the Sober READER.</HEAD>
<P>AS it has ever been allowed, that the defaming of the Dead is a mark of the mo&s;t unmanly and ba&s;e Spirit of a Coward, and ought to be abhorred by all Per&s;ons who bear the Image of Men; then how much more abominable is it of <HI>P. P.</HI> to &s;port him&s;elf with his own Lies over a Man in his Grave? And I think no Per&s;on of com|mon Rea&s;on will expect any Apology from me on account of this my Undertaking, &s;ince my Silence in this matter would have rendered me very unmanly.</P>
<P>And therefore I &s;hall proceed to inform the <HI>Reader</HI> what parts of his Book I have undertaken to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, As to his fir&s;t Chap. where he pre|tends to give an account of his being led into and recovered from <HI>Quakeri&s;m;</HI> I have remark|ed &s;o much of his own Relation of the matter, that I think will be &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy every Per&s;on that knows any thing of the Work of God wrought upon their Hearts, that what he calls his being led into <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> was the Day of his Vi&s;itation, and a gracious Call of God in Mercy to his Soul; and al&s;o what he calls his Recovery from <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> was nothing el&s;e
<PB N="ii" REF="002809_0003_0FE63FD82FEF7818">but his Apo&s;tacy, being overcome by Per&s;ecu|tion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And as to his Songs which he adds to the Account of his Recovery from <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> where|in he pretends to prai&s;e God for his Recovery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have briefly remark'd &s;ome of the gro&s;s Bla&s;phemies therein contained; as al&s;o &s;hewed by Scripture, that it is no other than the prac|tice of Hypocrites in former Ages in their Hy|pocri&s;y, to imitate the Prai&s;es of God's Peo|ple.</P>
<P>And as to what he &s;ays in his &s;econd Chap. wherein he pretends to give an account of the principal Heads of <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> I have only re|mark'd &s;ome gro&s;s Contradictions and ignorant Expre&s;&s;ions in which he abu&s;es <HI>J. R.</HI> and I have refered the <HI>Reader</HI> to <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Books, which will &s;ufficient di&s;cover the Author's Folly and Ma|lice; and which Books I have &s;ufficient by me to &s;upply any that de&s;ire Satisfaction in his Prin|ciples.</P>
<P>And as to his third Chap. wherein he pre|tends to give an Account of the unrea&s;onable|ne&s;s of <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Boa&s;ting of his &s;ufferings, and to offer &s;ome advice to &s;uch as hold his Principles. I have particularly proved all his Charges again&s;t <HI>J. R.</HI> to be notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e in every Article; and that the advice which he gives to &s;uch as hold his Principles, is nothing el&s;e but his own gro&s;s Darkne&s;s and Ignorance, by which he wre&s;ts the holy Scriptures and abu&s;es the Me&s;|&s;engers of God.</P>
<P>Al&s;o I have given a true and impartial Rela|tion of tho&s;e &s;ufferings of <HI>J. R.</HI> on which the Author has built his abu&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="002809_0004_0FE63FD831A93608">
And as to what he has &s;aid concerning the <HI>Quaker</HI>'s Principles, I have wholly omitted, and that for the&s;e following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e I am not in fellow&s;hip with them, and therefore it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to med|dle in their Quarrel.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Although I abhor the abu&s;ing of any Sect, yet becau&s;e I know them to be a nume|rous People, both wealthy and learned, and that they are in as good E&s;teem in the highe&s;t Courts of <HI>England</HI> as any of the Di&s;&s;enters in the King|dom, and therefore have no need of &s;uch mean Help as mine, but are well able to defend them|&s;elves again&s;t far more wi&s;e and potent Enemies than <HI>P. P.</HI> And I am well knowing that <HI>P. P.</HI> is a Man wholly ignorant concerning the Prin|ciples of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> being brought up and al|ways living in <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colony, where he has never had the opportunity of acquainting him|&s;elf with either their Per&s;ons or Books. And for as much as I have been well knowing to his management from a Child, I have &s;ufficient grounds to be well &s;atisfied that he never had one Hours Di&s;cour&s;e with a <HI>Quaker</HI> in his life, as to matters of Religion, excepting a few Words formerly with one <HI>Chaddack,</HI> a young Man who was then inclining to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and &s;ince is joyned in fellow&s;hip with them at <HI>Rhoad-I&s;land;</HI> which di&s;cou&s;e he has often told me of: nor do I &s;uppo&s;e that he was ever at a <HI>Quakers</HI> Meeting in his Life, nor has ever &s;een any of their Books, excepting only <HI>Robert Barkley</HI>'s Apology, which he lately borrowed.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="002809_0005_0FE63FE2D1548218">
And as to the many Quotations out of the <HI>Quaker</HI>'s Books, which he has made u&s;e of a|gain&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> I do affirm they are every one taken out of one Sheet of Paper, put forth by one <HI>George Keith,</HI> a Man which I well knew, and who was as famous for changing his Religi|on, as <HI>P. P.</HI> him&s;elf. For fir&s;t he was a <HI>Pre&s;|byterian</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> then turned <HI>Quaker,</HI> and &s;o remained many years; after which he turned <HI>Church man,</HI> and then bent his whole force to re|vile and reproach the <HI>Quakers:</HI> and among o|ther of his Writings again&s;t them, he put forth this Sheet above-mentioned, wherein he greatly abu&s;ed their Books, by taking and leaving &s;uch parts as might mo&s;t de&s;troy the &s;en&s;e. And one <HI>Daniel Leeds</HI> an Almanack-maker, and a great Friend to the &s;aid <HI>Keith,</HI> Tran&s;cribed the &s;ame Quotations out of the above-mentioned Sheet of Paper, and put them into his Almanack; and I do affirm, that every individual Quotation in <HI>P. P</HI>'s. Book which he brings again&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> he has taken out of the above-named Sheet or old Almanack; and I am ready to &s;atisfy any Per&s;on of the truth of what I here a&s;&s;ert, that plea&s;es to call at my Hou&s;e, for as much as I have one of the &s;ame Sheets and Almanacks by me ready to compare with his Book, by which it is manife&s;t that he never &s;aw tho&s;e Books out of which the&s;e Quotations were taken.</P>
<P>And indeed it was great folly in him &s;o to ex|po&s;e him&s;elf, as to pretend to inform others in the Principles of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> when at the &s;ame time him&s;elf knew not what a <HI>Quaker</HI> was, as appears by his calling <HI>J. R.</HI> a <HI>Quaker,</HI> who was
<PB N="v" REF="002809_0006_0FE63FE2D3DEF9A0">the greate&s;t Writer again&s;t and publick Oppo&s;er of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the chief Principles wherein they differ from other Sects, that ever was in <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colony, as his Books will largely make appear.</P>
<P>And it is marvellous that <HI>P. P.</HI> &s;hould be &s;o prompt with only licking up &s;ome of the Vomit of &s;uch an Apo&s;tate as <HI>G. Keith</HI> out of an old Almanack, as to undertake to inform the World that he would &s;hew them the principal Heads of Quakeri&s;m, in the fir&s;t &s;econd and third &s;teps of its Progre&s;s in the World, as he promi&s;es in his 39th. page.</P>
<P>Al&s;o in the &s;ame page he promi&s;es to &s;hew <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Opinions, without any reference to his Books, for which he renders &s;everal rea&s;ons, (as he calls them) Fir&s;t, &s;ays he, <HI>Becau&s;e I don't need them.</HI></P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That this is a very un|intelligible and Childi&s;h Rea&s;on; for we know that the Rea&s;on why Authors quote the Books of them they write again&s;t, is not becau&s;e they want them them&s;elves, but becau&s;e the Reader wants them, that they may thereby be &s;atisfied of the truth of what the Author charges them with.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Rea&s;on he gives is, <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>they contain but few of his Principles.</HI></P>
<P>To which Rea&s;on I quaery as follows, That if <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Books contain but few of his Princi|ples, then how comes <HI>P. P.</HI> to know what his Principles are &s;everal years after his Death? ex|cept the &s;ame Spirit which once deceived him in the matter of <HI>Longitude,</HI> has again deceived
<PB N="vi" REF="002809_0007_0FE63FE45CE69328">him concerning <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Principles; and we have as much Rea&s;on to que&s;tion the truth of what he tells us of <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Principles, (&s;ince he makes no better proof than his own bare Word) as the General A&s;&s;embly had to que&s;tion the truth of his Longitude, which &s;oon after proved to be a Delu&s;ion of Satan.</P>
<P>Now by the&s;e fooli&s;h and vain pretended Rea&s;ons, the Reader may plainly &s;ee, that he only wanted an excu&s;e to evade <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Books, that he might take his full &s;wing to bely and abu&s;e him at his plea&s;ure; becau&s;e he well knew that if he had Quoted his Books, they would have di&s;covered his Lies and Fal&s;hoods.</P>
<P>But I &s;hould not have enlarged &s;o much up|on this head, were it not that I am &s;en&s;ible that there are many thou&s;ands of grown Per&s;ons in this Colony, that for want of opportunity to be informed in the Principles of other Sects, re|main &s;o ignorant, that they know no diffe|rence between the Church of <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> nor between the <HI>Quakers</HI> and the <HI>Bap|ti&s;ts,</HI> but e&s;teem each couple to be alike.</P>
<P>And how is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;hould be able to di&s;cern the Ignorance of <HI>P. P.?</HI></P>
<P>In the next place I &s;hall mind the <HI>Reader,</HI> that in all his charges again&s;t <HI>J. R.</HI> (the dead Man with whom he has engaged War) he has not prov|ed one Article of his charges; excepting where he pretends to give an Account of his Principles, at the end of every fal&s;hood he adds the name <HI>Ro|gers,</HI> which if that may pa&s;s for &s;ufficient Proof, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that he has found out a new Art,
<PB N="vii" REF="002809_0008_0FE63FE45EC906F8">which may be as helpful to the Hi&s;torian as his Longitude might have been to the Mariner, had it but fell with the right &s;ide up, for by this new way of proof, the Hi&s;torian may write what he plea&s;es as <HI>P. P.</HI> has done, and at the end place but the name <HI>Rogers,</HI> will be as good proof as a|ny in <HI>P. P</HI>'s. Book.</P>
<P>And whereas it has ever been allowed by the wi&s;e and learned, that the very Marrow and Life of all Books con&s;i&s;ts in good proof, without which Books are no better than idle Tales, and are but an abu&s;e to the Reader.</P>
<P>Then how marvellous is it that <HI>P. P.</HI> who knew him&s;elf to be a Man &s;o uncon&s;tant and changable, not only in his worldly concerns from his very Childhood, but al&s;o in matters of Reli|gion &s;ince he has arrived to riper years, &s;hould pre&s;ume to put out a Book only on his bare Word, without any proof at all.</P>
<P>Surely he might rea&s;onably have thought that all who knew him, would expect better Proof from &s;uch an uncon&s;tant Per&s;on, than from an|other Man.</P>
<P>However, &s;ince I have taken upon me the trou|ble of proving the main Articles of his Book to be fal&s;e, I hope it will be a good motive to con|vince him, that his word is not a &s;ufficient foun|dation to build any more of his Book on.</P>
<P>Yet if he &s;hould pre&s;ume to do it, I think no &s;olid Per&s;on who &s;hall read and con&s;ider this pre&s;ent An&s;wer to his Book, will judge it worth my while to follow him any farther.</P>
<P>And for as much as I abhor the publi&s;hing of &s;uch Romance Books as have no Proof but the
<PB N="viii" REF="002809_0009_0FE63FECAD173680">Author's bare Word, and &s;o tend only to wa&s;te and con&s;ume the precious time of the Reader, and leaves the Reader as Ignorant as it &s;ound him; &s;o the Reader will find that I have been at con&s;iderable trouble and Charge in procuring good Proof to all the main Articles that I have a&s;&s;erted throughout this Treati&s;e, by which the Readers will be a&s;&s;ured of the Truth of what they Read, which doubtle&s;s will be better &s;atis|faction than the other.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place I &s;hall ob&s;erve to the Reader, that throughout my whole Treati&s;e where&s;oever I have had occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of Te&s;timonies, I have taken &s;uch Per&s;ons as the Reader may be &s;en&s;ible are mo&s;t knowing to the matter they te&s;tify to. <HI>(As for In&s;tance)</HI></P>
<P>In page 56th. <HI>P. P.</HI> affirms, that great part of <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Impri&s;onment at <HI>Hartford,</HI> was upon &s;trong &s;u&s;picion of his being acce&s;&s;ary to the Burning of <HI>New-London</HI> Meeting-hou&s;e. Now tho' I might have had multitudes of Witne&s;&s;es that would have te&s;tified that this affirmation was fal&s;e, yet I took the pains of going more than fifty Miles to get the Jaylor's own Te&s;timony, be|cau&s;e every one knows that he was well knowing to the matter. Al&s;o as to the great Horror which <HI>P. P.</HI>'s Father fell into before his Death, on ac|count of his Marrying <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Wife, tho' multi|tudes of People were knowing to it, it being the Publick Di&s;cour&s;e of the Country in the time of it; yet I have taken both Witne&s;&s;es out of one Family of his near Neighbours, and a Hou&s;e which he was mo&s;t Intimate at of any Hou&s;e in the Town, as is well known to the ancient
<PB N="ix" REF="002809_0010_0FE63FECAED32AD8">Neighbours thereabouts; and &s;o in many other ca&s;es I have done the like, as the Reader may ea&s;ily di&s;cern.</P>
<P>And although <HI>P. P.</HI> did &s;ufficiently di&s;cover his unmanline&s;s to the World, by picking a Quar|rel with a dead Man, as he him&s;elf is forced to confe&s;s in the beginning of his Book; yet had he but u&s;ed fair play in the time of his Engage|ment, I &s;hould never have concerned my &s;elf in the Quarrel, being well &s;atisfied that he never could thereby have hurt his Antagoni&s;t. But when I &s;aw him begin to u&s;e &s;uch abominable &s;oul play, I thought it proper to &s;tep between them, and take his Weapon out of his hand, judging that a Wooden Sword might better &s;uit his Courage.</P>
<P>And whether any Per&s;on in the vindication of a dead Father would have done le&s;s than I have done, I freely leave to the Judgment of all Mankind.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="002809_0015_0FE63FF4C9D699B8">Colony (as I have ever heard of) that did Pub|lickly in Print oppo&s;e the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in tho&s;e main Principles wherein they differ from other Sects.

<PB N="3" REF="002809_0016_0FE63FF4CBB46A08">page he largely proves that the <HI>Light within</HI> is not the Chri&s;t. To which Di&s;cour&s;e he adds an Expo&s;ition on mo&s;t of tho&s;e Scriptures which the <HI>Quakers</HI> commonly make u&s;e of to prove their A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, in his Expo&s;ition on the <HI>Revelati|ons,</HI> he largely proves the Re&s;urrection of the Body, beginning at page 232.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that it is nothing el&s;e but <HI>P.P.</HI>'s ignorance in charging <HI>J.

<P>Now the fir&s;t Fal&s;hood which I &s;hall ob&s;erve in this place, is his a&s;&s;erting that the fir&s;t notions of Spirituality taken by <HI>J. R.</HI> was from <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> and <HI>Banks,</HI> &amp;c. Whereas the above Witne&s;&s;es Te&s;ti|ly,
<PB N="6" REF="002809_0019_0FE63FFFC54F6000">that he had broke off from the Church of <HI>New-London,</HI> and joyned with the Seventh-day <HI>Bapti&s;ts;</HI> upon which account his Wife had left him. And that all this was many years before <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> and <HI>Banks</HI> fir&s;t came into this Colony.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Fal&s;hood is his &s;aying, <HI>The&s;e Men,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>lit of</HI> J. R. <HI>and made a</HI> Quaker <HI>of him;</HI> whereas the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es Te&s;tify, that he never inclined to their way, nor countenanced their Practices, but continued in the Religion which he was in before.</P>
<P>The third Fal&s;hood is his &s;aying, <HI>He remained their Di&s;ciple for a while,</HI> &s;ince it is fully proved that he never was their Di&s;ciple at all.</P>
<P><HI>The fourth Fal&s;hood is his &s;aying,</HI> That after be had remained their Di&s;ciple a while, be made a tran&s;ition to the Church of the &s;eventh-day Bapti&s;ts.</P>
<P>Whereas it is fully proved, that his joyning with the &s;eventh-day <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> was many years be|fore tho&s;e People fir&s;t came into this Colony.</P>
<P>Another po&s;itive Fal&s;hood is his a&s;&s;erting, <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>acknowledged his Spirit, and be theirs.</HI></P>
<P>For as much as they always denied him, and would not &s;uffer him to Preach in their A&s;&s;em|blies.</P>
<P>And although he did allow that the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> at their fir&s;t coming forth, and &s;e|parating from the World, were the faithful Chil|dren of God, the &s;ame al&s;o he confe&s;&s;ed of <HI>Lu|ther,</HI> and the Martyrs in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s time; yet it would be as weak an Argument as <HI>P. P.</HI>'s for any to &s;ay, that becau&s;e <HI>J. R.</HI> acknowledg|ed the Spirit of <HI>Luther,</HI> that therefore he mu&s;t needs be called a <HI>Lutheran,</HI> or Church of <HI>England</HI> Man.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002809_0020_0FE63FFFC95465B0">
And we find both by the Old and New-Te&s;ta|ment, that the Church of God &s;eldom remained in a &s;tate of Purity &s;o long as fifty years at any one time. Nay, &s;ome of the Churches that were brought into the Faith by <HI>Paul,</HI> were &s;o far &s;ub|verted before his Death, that they were turned from him, as is to be &s;een 1 <HI>Tim</HI> 1.15. <HI>This thou knowe&s;t, that all they which are in</HI> A&s;ia <HI>be turned a|way from me,</HI> &amp;c. We al&s;o find that the Church of <HI>Sardis,</HI> in the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI>'s time was &s;o de|clined, that they had only a <HI>Name to live, and were dead.</HI> By which I under&s;tand, that although they retained their outward form of Wor&s;hip, yet had lo&s;t the Spirit of God, and were got into the Spirit of the World, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.1.</P>
<P>And that <HI>J. R.</HI> always Te&s;tified, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> were fallen from their fir&s;t love, is well known.</P>
<P>But now I would mind the Reader of his Con|&s;e&s;&s;ion and Promi&s;e in his <HI>Adverti&s;ement. Fir&s;t,</HI> he confe&s;&s;es his unmanline&s;s in writing agin&s;t a dead Man, which I doubt not but will be the Judgment of all &s;ober Per&s;ons as well as him|&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> His Promi&s;e, <HI>upon which account</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>J. R.'s Character is u&s;ed with as much tenderne&s;s as the &s;ubject will po&s;&s;ibly allow of.</HI> From which it may ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the &s;ubject of his Book is Envy and Malice again&s;t <HI>J. R.</HI> the dead Man with whom he has proclaimed War; Since it will admit of no tenderne&s;s at all, as ap|pears by the five Fal&s;hoods already proved, which by the heat of his fir&s;t Engagement, has cau&s;ed him to vomit up. And I would advi&s;e him not
<PB N="8" REF="002809_0021_0FE640084AED8028">to make Lies his refuge, nor hide him&s;elf under Fal&s;hoods, as &s;ome have done, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 28.15.</P>
<P>And whereas among his other Scoffs and Fal&s;hoods, he a&s;&s;erts that <HI>J. R.</HI> often changed his Principles. To which I an&s;wer, That upon condition that <HI>P. P.</HI> will make it appear that <HI>J. R.</HI> ever altered or varied in any one Article of his Religion, &s;ince his &s;eparating from the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and joyning with the &s;eventh-day <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> which is more than fifty years pa&s;t, (ex|cepting only as to the ob&s;ervation of the &s;eventh day) I will reward him with the &s;um of <HI>twenty Pounds</HI> for his labour. No verily, he mi&s;takes the Man, it was not <HI>J. R.</HI> that u&s;ed to change his Religion, but it was <HI>P. P.</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In page 7th. he makes this ob&s;ervation, <HI>viz.</HI> that there are certain times which pa&s;s over &s;ome Men, in which they are in more eminent dan|ger of departing from the Faith, and giving heed to &s;educing Spirits.</P>
<P>One (&s;ays he) is the time of &s;ore Affliction <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We know (&s;ays he) the Jews under Dark and Afflictive Providences Murmured and fell to I|dolatry.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Here he greatly abu&s;es the Scripture through his own ignorance; for the Scripture a|bundantly informs us, that it was in Pro&s;perity that the Jews fell to Idolatry, and that God's u&s;u|al way to bring them out of their Idolatry was, by &s;ending &s;ore Afflictions on them.</P>
<P>Another time (&s;ays he) is when a Man has &s;uffered very unju&s;t Treatment from Men, as he conceives, and having applied to the Authority
<PB N="9" REF="002809_0022_0FE640084F43B318">for Relief, but not obtaining it, he'll be tempted to think uncharitably of and rail again&s;t them; which if he allows him&s;elf to do, his next Temp|tation will be to fall away to &s;ome party that oppo&s;es them; and this was the ca&s;e of one <HI>Gates</HI> in <HI>New-London</HI> County.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> If this was the ca&s;e of <HI>Gates, viz.</HI> that he &s;uffered very unju&s;t Treatment from Men as he conceived, and applying to the Authority for Relief, but obtaining none; then it was very agreeable to Scripture, to withdraw from &s;uch a corrupted People, where the com|mon People were &s;o corrupted as to treat their Neighbours very unju&s;tly; and the Authority whom God has &s;et up to puni&s;h evil doers &s;o corrupted, as to grant no Relief in &s;uch ca&s;es; &s;urely the&s;e were great Di&s;orders, and it was highly commendable in <HI>Gates</HI> to obey the com|mand of the holy Scripture, 2 <HI>The&s;. 3.6. Now we command you, Brethren, in the Name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that you withdraw your &s;elves from eve|ry Brother that walketh di&s;orderly,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In Page 8th he quaeries as follows; <HI>And what could I have done le&s;s than to have di&s;played Signals of Danger over tho&s;e fatal Rocks and Sands, on which I had &s;uffered Shipwreck?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he here intends a Spiritual Shipwreck, for that he never has been a Man concerned in Sea Affairs: And for as much as I know of no Spiritual Shipwreck mentioned in Scripture, but that of <HI>Faith and a good Con&s;cience,</HI> which I am &s;ure he has &s;uffered; and that he may &s;tand for a Signal to be a Warning to o|thers, is my earne&s;t de&s;ire: And if any Per&s;on
<PB N="10" REF="002809_0023_0FE6400952E81298">&s;hould happen to fall into the <HI>Longitude</HI> of tho&s;e Rocks and Sands, I would advi&s;e them to look out &s;harp, and they will &s;ee more &s;ignals than <HI>P. P. viz. Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> who are &s;ig|nals of the &s;ame Rocks and Sands. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.19, 20. <HI>Holding Faith and a good Con&s;cience, which &s;ome having put away, concerning Faith have made Shipwreck. Of whom is</HI> Hymeneus <HI>and</HI> Alexan|der, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And al&s;o as Hi&s;tory informs us of <HI>Francis Spira,</HI> who like <HI>P. P.</HI> denyed the Truth by Publick Recantation, and thereby was received into the favour of the World, and &s;o &s;tands for a &s;ignal with the other three above mentioned.</P>
<P>And now we are come to his fir&s;t Chap. which is as follows.</P>
<P>CHAP. 1&s;t. <HI>Giving an Account of the Author's being led into, and his Recovery from</HI> Quakeri&s;m.</P>
<Q><P>My near alliance to <HI>John Rogers</HI> (then Juni|or) who is my Brother, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Son of my Mother, proved an unhappy Snare to me. He being naturally a Man as Manly, Wi&s;e, Face|tious and Generous, perhaps as one among a thou&s;and, I was exceedingly delighted in and with his Conver&s;ation. He al&s;o indeared him|&s;elf to me very much by his repeated Expre&s;|&s;ions of Complacency in me, by which I was induced to be frequently in his company, and often at his Hou&s;e, where his Father would be entertaining of me with Exhortations to a Re|ligious life, warning me of the danger of Sin, and certainty of that Wrath which &s;hall come on all that know not God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I would &s;ome times for Curio&s;ity be enquiring into his Prin|ciples, and other times for Diver&s;ion be di&s;pu|ting
<PB N="11" REF="002809_0024_0FE6400955564BA8">a point with him; but I knew not <HI>that the dead were there,</HI> Prov. 7.24. I was not Re|ligious enough to be much concerned about his Principles, but pitiful enough to be extream|ly moved with the Story of his Sufferings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I had al&s;o a re&s;erve in his favour, that it was po&s;&s;ible he might be a good Man, (the &s;trange|ne&s;s of his Doctrine notwith&s;tanding) e&s;pecial|ly &s;eeing all his Sufferings were not able to &s;hake his Con&s;tancy, or oblige him to recede from the lea&s;t part of his Religion.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Here I ob&s;erve, that he owns that <HI>J. R.</HI> would be entertaining him with Exhortations to a Religious life, warning him of the danger of Sin, and certainty of that Wrath which &s;hall come on all that know not God.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, This was the &s;ame Doc|trine which the Prophets and Apo&s;tles taught their Hearers, as may be &s;een <HI>Mat. 3.2. Repent ye, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</HI> Ver&s;e 7. <HI>Who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come,</HI> &amp;c. To which he Replies, <HI>That he knew not that the dead were there;</HI> Prov. 7.24. And in the very next words adds, <HI>That he was not Religious enough to be much concerned about his Principles.</HI> By which the Reader may ea&s;ily di&s;cern that the dead was there &s;ure enough, that is <HI>P. P.</HI> was there, who was dead in Sins and Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, not being Re|ligious enough to be concerned to live a Righ|teous Life, or to take warning of the danger of Sin, and certainty of the Wrath of God, which <HI>is Revealed from Heaven again&s;t all Ungodline&s;s and Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of Men,</HI> &amp;c. Rom. 1.18. Now if he intends <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Exhortation by the dead being
<PB N="12" REF="002809_0025_0FE640141F0B3078">there, I think it is becau&s;e he is in that &s;tate of darkne&s;s &s;poken of, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 5.20. <HI>Wo unto them that call Evil Good, and Good Evil; that put Darkne&s;s for Light, and Light for Darkne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But he acknowledges that he was pitiful e|nough to be extreamly moved with the Story of his Sufferings.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That whoever &s;hould be made &s;en&s;ible of <HI>J. Rogers</HI>'s Sufferings, had they not an Heart of Stone, would be as much moved with pity as <HI>P. P.</HI> &s;ince I &s;uppo&s;e the like has not been known in the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> for &s;ome Ages pa&s;t; and which continued for more than forty five Years.</P>
<P>He al&s;o confe&s;&s;es, that he had a re&s;erve in his Favour, <HI>that po&s;&s;ibly he might be a good Man,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>e&s;pecially &s;eeing all his Sufferings were not able to &s;hake his Con&s;tancy, or oblige him to recede from the lea&s;t part of his Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s this Rea&s;on of <HI>P. P.</HI> is very &s;ound, and agreeable with the Scripture; and &s;ufficiently proves that <HI>J. R.</HI> was not like the <HI>&s;tony Ground</HI> &s;poken of <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.20, 21. <HI>But he that receiveth the &s;eed into &s;tony places, the &s;ame is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it: Yet hath he not root in him&s;elf, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation or per&s;ecution ari&s;eth be|cau&s;e of the Word, by and by he is offended.</HI> But &s;ays <HI>P. P. All his Sufferings were not able to &s;hake his Con&s;tancy, or oblige him to recede from the lea&s;t part of his Religion.</HI></P>
<P>This ol&s;o proves him to be one of tho&s;e which Chri&s;t &s;peaks of <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.24, 25. <HI>Therefore who&s;o|ever heareth the&s;e &s;ayings of mine, and doth them, I
<PB N="13" REF="002809_0026_0FE64014225D0AF8">will liken him unto a wi&s;e man which built his hou&s;e upon a rock: and the Rain de&s;cended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that hou&s;e, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.</HI></P>
<P><HI>At length</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>my Brother became a very &s;trict and devout Profe&s;&s;or of his Father's Religion, and &s;o became le&s;s &s;ociable, tell at length our Conver|&s;ation was almo&s;t wholly &s;u&s;pended for divers Years.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> Here it is ob&s;ervable, that when his Brother became a &s;trict and devout Profe&s;&s;or of his Father's Religion, and him&s;elf remained in his vain Conver&s;ation, they could no longer re|tain their former Fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>Which well agrees with the Te&s;timony of the holy Scripture, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.14, 15. <HI>For what fellow|&s;hip hath Righteou&s;ne&s;s with Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s? and what communion hath Light with Darkne&s;s? And what Concord hath Chri&s;t with Belial? And what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel?</HI></P>
<P>In page 2d. he enters upon his account of his fir&s;t being led into <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> as he calls it.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, <HI>it plea&s;ed God in a &s;olitary moment to bring into his thoughts tho&s;e words, For&s;ake the Fooli&s;h and live, and go in the way of under&s;tanding.</HI> Prov. 9.6. He &s;ays, he under&s;tood them to &s;ugge&s;t that if he would live Eternally, he mu&s;t for&s;ake his Sins, which the Scripture calls <HI>Folly,</HI> and his vain Companions, which the Scripture calls <HI>Fools.</HI></P>
<P>In page 3d he &s;ays, he took the Words as a Re|proof of his vain Cour&s;e of life, and a Coun&s;el and Invitation to him to walk with the wi&s;e &amp; be wi&s;e. <HI>Whereupon</HI> (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) <HI>I fully re&s;olved from Thenceforth to turn from Sin to God, and accordingly
<PB N="14" REF="002809_0027_0FE640195D46D7B0">began to &s;et up a &s;trict and Religious Cour&s;e of Life, to reform the Errors of my ways, to Pray to God in &s;ecret,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In page 5th. he goes on to give an account how ince&s;&s;antly he cryed to God for Mercy and Grace by &s;ecret Prayer, and how the Devil op|po&s;ed him in his &s;ecret Prayer. And in page 6th. he gives an Account how earne&s;tly he cry|ed to God to rebuke tho&s;e foul Spirits, and how in&s;tantly God an&s;wered his Prayer, and cau&s;ed them to vani&s;h away.</P>
<P>In page 7th. he gives an Account how he be|gan to Que&s;tion whether he had not been in the way of an Erroneous and Heterodox Religion; and that upon this doubt with all po&s;&s;ible Ear|ne&s;tne&s;s he asked Coun&s;el of the <HI>Wonderful Coun|&s;ellor,</HI> and Wi&s;dom of him that gives it <HI>liberally to all.</HI></P>
<P>In the remaining part of this 7th. page, toge|ther with the 8th. and part of the 9th. he &s;till goes on to &s;hew what &s;cruples and doubts he was in as to the &s;everal forms of Religion; and in the latter part of the 9th. page he gives an Account how Earne&s;tly he cryed to God to di|rect him in the matter, which he gives in man|ner following.</P>
<Q><P>In this di&s;tre&s;s I poured out my Soul to God in Prayer, I implored the Guidance of his Word and Spirit, I confe&s;&s;ed my lo&s;t and Sinful E|&s;tate, but I told him of his Word, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 13.9. <HI>O I&s;rael, thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy &s;elf, but in me is thy help found.</HI></P>
<P>I flew to our Saviour's Words, <HI>That if a Son ask Bread, the Father will not give him a Stone.</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="002809_0028_0FE64019839C6488">Luke 11.11. and pleaded them in this man|ner: <HI>O thou that heare&s;t Prayers, and ha&s;t never &s;aid to the &s;eed of</HI> Jacob, &s;eek ye me in vain; <HI>who art a fountain of light and truth, and therefore the Sons of Men believe thy Word, behold the promi&s;e of thy Son, which I now humbly plead before thee. I implore the Bread of Life, and the knowledge of the Truth. Wilt thou now &s;end me &s;trong Delu&s;ions to believe lies, and &s;o let his Words fall to the ground? Surely thou wilt not, for they are &s;ettled in Heaven, and more permanent than the Heavens or the Earth, and I will believe them, and adventure my Soul thereupon.</HI></P></Q>
<P>In page 11th he tells us, <HI>That after this he &s;oon laid a&s;ide Family-Prayer, could &s;ee no Rule for the practice of it.</HI></P>
<Q><P>The eighth of <HI>January,</HI> (&s;ays he) being the Lord's-Day, I doubted &s;o much of the Sab|bath, that I dared not go to Meeting.</P>
<P>The 22d of <HI>January</HI> I thought it my Duty to Labour as on other Days, and I did &s;o.</P></Q>
<P>Now that which is ob&s;ervable in the Rela|tion which he has been giving is, that when he came to fear that he had been in the way of an erroneous and heterodox Religion, and re&s;olved to examine it, and thereupon asked Coun&s;el of the <HI>Wonderful Coun&s;ellor,</HI> as he &s;ays he did, and earne&s;tly pleaded with God to give him the knowledge of the Truth, and that he might not be held under &s;trong Delu&s;ions to believe lies.</P>
<P>And now God is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to di&s;co|ver to him tho&s;e &s;trong Delu&s;ions, which he had &s;o long been deceived by, in thinking to plea&s;e God by attending formal and cu&s;tomary Pray|ers,
<PB N="16" REF="002809_0029_0FE64024425BFD18">which he had been taught by Tradition, and had been practi&s;ing in his unregenerate &s;tate, while he was in fellow&s;hip with Hypo|crites, who always love to pray in Synagogues and publick places, which Chri&s;t forbids his Di&s;ciples to practice, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.5.</P>
<P>Another &s;trong Delu&s;ion which is now di&s;|covered to him upon his earne&s;t Prayer, is con|cerning the <HI>fir&s;t Day,</HI> which in his unregenerate &s;tate he thought to be a <HI>Sabbath;</HI> but upon this an&s;wer of Prayer, he thought it his Duty to labour on as on other Days, and did &s;o. So al|&s;o when he &s;aw no Rule for the practice of his formal Prayer, he &s;oon laid it a&s;ide: All which proves his faithfulne&s;s to God at that time, by yielding Obedience to what God di&s;covered to him.</P>
<P>Page 12th he declares, that on the 26th of <HI>January</HI> he was carried to Pri&s;on for refu&s;ing to pay a fine laid on him for prophaning the Sab|bath la&s;t before. In the &s;ame page he tells us, how &s;ome laboured to allure him by pro&s;pects of worldly Advantage; and in page 13th. &s;ome cur&s;ed him in the Streets, wi&s;hing him dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Others by mocking and other verbal abu&s;es mini&s;tred &s;uch Provocations, as one would think nothing but a Stock or Stone would have been &s;ilent under.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> This is no new thing, but hath always been the practice of the wicked World to per&s;e|cute, Mock, Deride and Revile Gods faithful Children, as both Old and New-Te&s;taments do abundantly inform us. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.11. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are you when Men &s;hall Revile you, and Per&s;ecute you, and

<P>In the 13th. page he al&s;o tells us, how that <HI>in the Morning before he went to Pri&s;on, he committed all concerns and Intere&s;ts to God by &s;olemn Prayer, and that taking a &s;ad farewel of his Wife, addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to the Journey, taking a Bible with him.</HI></P>
<P>He al&s;o largely &s;ets forth how great and ter|rible his Tryals were, in for&s;aking his dear Wife, with all other valuables in this World.</P>
<P>In page 14th. &s;ays he, <HI>Under the&s;e pre&s;&s;ing Burthens I went to</HI> New-London, <HI>about &s;ixteen miles from my own Hou&s;e, lifting up my Heart to God by the way, in thou&s;ands of Ejaculations, with the mo&s;t vehement application of Mind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> This account which he gives of his giving up in this great Trial is &s;ufficient to
<PB N="18" REF="002809_0031_0FE6402547BDB850">prove, that the great Love of God was &s;hed a|broad in his Heart at that time, by which he was enabled to for&s;ake his dear Wife, with all other Earthly things for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and as Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.37, 38. <HI>He that loveth Fa|ther or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me;</HI> then may we &s;afely con|clude, that &s;uch as love Chri&s;t above all Earthly things, and are ready to take up their Cro&s;s and follow him, are worthy of him, all which <HI>P. P.</HI> then did.</P>
<P>He al&s;o tells us, how that <HI>in this great Tryal, he lift up his Heart to God in thou&s;ands of Ejacula|tions, with the mo&s;t vehement application of Mind,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>He &s;till goes on in this 14th. page to &s;et forth the great aggravations of his Tryals, by the <HI>In|&s;ulting of the Jaylor over him,</HI> al&s;o the <HI>going into a dark Goal without Fire or Lodgings, in a very cold Sea&s;on,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the 15th. page he &s;ays, <Q>Under the&s;e A|gonies, his <HI>Fle&s;h and Heart cryed out for God, for the &s;trong and living God,</HI> I &s;upplicated his Mercy for Chri&s;t &s;ake, (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) confe&s;&s;ing my Sin and Mi&s;ery; I Ble&s;&s;ed him for his Word, and appealed to his Omni&s;ciency, that I de&s;ired to keep his Precepts. I implored his Spirit to help my Infirmities, and to <HI>lead me in|to all Truth.</HI></Q></P>
<Q><P>After this, (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) looking into my Bible I lit upon the eighth Chap. to the <HI>Rom.</HI> and read on to the 35th. Ver&s;e, whereupon I was blown up into an extatick Joy: I thought I
<PB N="19" REF="002809_0032_0FE64025587759F8">had now a&s;&s;urance of my Union to Chri&s;t, &amp; that nothing &s;hould &s;eparate me from his Love.</P>
<P>This Rapture la&s;ted me that Night, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I was (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) in the Goal five days, in which time <HI>J. R.</HI> and his Company often vi|&s;ited and treated me with &s;ufficient Expre&s;&s;ions of their tendere&s;t Regard; Providing me a Lodging in the Goaler's Hou&s;e the fir&s;t Night, otherwi&s;e 'tis like I &s;hould have dyed of the Cold, being a Man of a tender Con&s;titution, and not innured to hard&s;hips; and afterwards they furni&s;hed me with Lodging and other things for my Comfort, during my Impri&s;on|ment, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Page 16th. he tells us, That the next Re|markable that happened, was upon Reading</HI> Rom. <HI>10.9, 10.</HI> If thou &s;halt confe&s;s with thy Mouth the Lord Je&s;us, and &s;halt Believe with thine Heart, that God hath rai&s;ed him from the dead, thou &s;halt be &s;aved: for with the heart Man Be|lieveth unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and with the mouth Confe&s;&s;ion is made unto Salvation.</P>
<P>Page 17th. He tells us, that his Sorrows were now turned into Joy, and his Prayers into Prai&s;es of the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame page (&s;ays he) on the fifth day of my Confinement, my wife (again&s;t my ex|pre&s;s Prohibition) having paid the Fine, and procured a <HI>Mandamus</HI> to the Goaler to di&s;|charge me, the Me&s;&s;enger came in the Morn|ing. This was &s;urpri&s;ing and unwelcome news to me, for that Morning I had awaked in a
<PB N="20" REF="002809_0033_0FE6402AD2FB3120">marvellous Calm, every thing was plea&s;ant and ea&s;y to me, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>Page 18th. (&s;ays he) Among&s;t other things I had a de&s;ire to be Bapti&s;ed by <HI>J. R.</HI> Tho&s;e words in <HI>Acts</HI> 22.16. ran much in my mind, <HI>And now why tarrie&s;t thou? Ari&s;e and be Bapti&s;ed, and wa&s;h away thy Sins,</HI> &amp;c. And accordingly I was Bapti&s;ed of him, as &s;oon as relea&s;ed from Pri&s;on, by burying my Body in the Water. Af|ter which I went home, it being <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI></P></Q>
<P>And now we are got through the account which he gives of his being led into <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> as in his gro&s;s darkne&s;s he calls it.</P>
<P>Now the next account he is entering upon, is what he calls his recovery out of <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> which in truth is nothing el&s;e but his Apo&s;tacy, being overcome by Per&s;ecution, according to what is written <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.20, 21. Concerning the <HI>Stony places,</HI> which <HI>receive the Word with Joy, but when Tribulation or Per&s;ecution ari&s;eth, they are of|fended;</HI> So was it with <HI>P. P.</HI> who being thus o|vercome, &s;oon turns like the <HI>Dog to his own vomit,</HI> that is licks up again tho&s;e erroneous Principles which &s;o lately he had di&s;gorged; and like the <HI>Sow that was wa&s;hed, to her wallowing in the mire,</HI> by defiling him&s;elf again with his former vain Conver&s;ation and Companions.</P>
<P>And now as to the Account of his Recovery out of <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> as he vainly calls it, I &s;hall only Remark &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages briefly, which may be &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy every &s;ober Reader, that he &s;oon fell from Grace, into a &s;tate of total Darkne&s;s; as by his own account appears, in the following Words: <Q>The re&s;idue of that
<PB N="21" REF="002809_0034_0FE6402AD65E0748">Week, (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) I walked in Darkne&s;s and deep Di&s;tre&s;s; for as I was without Light, &s;o I was without Comfort.</Q></P>
<P>Here it is very ob&s;ervable, that as God had comforted and &s;upported him in the time of his Suffering, while he continued in&s;tant in Prayer and faithfulne&s;s to God; &s;o upon his for&s;aking God, and embracing the things of this World, God leaves him in darkne&s;s and deep di&s;tre&s;s. This is no other than the Scriptures abundantly &s;hew us, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.12. <HI>If we &s;uffer, we &s;hall al&s;o reign with him; if we deny him, he al&s;o will deny us.</HI></P>
<P>In page 23d. he tells us, <Q>that at the end of three Weeks, he made a Publick Recantation, which the Church accepting, received him in|to their Charity.</Q></P>
<P>And here I cannot but take notice, That im|mediately upon his Apo&s;tacy, and returning back into the &s;pirit of the World, he is again re|ceived into the favour of tho&s;e <HI>I&s;hmaeliti&s;h</HI> Per&s;e|cutors, who as he tells us in page 13th. a few days before this were Cur&s;ing him in the Streets, and wi&s;hing him dead: and by mockings &amp; other abu&s;es mini&s;tred &s;uch Provocations to him, that one would think nothing but a Stock or Stone would have been &s;ilent under.</P>
<P>And in page 15th. he gives us an account, how that the fir&s;t Night in which he fell into the hands of tho&s;e cruel Per&s;ecutors, they were like to have Murthered him in the Pri&s;on, had not <HI>J. R.</HI> and his Company prevented, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>In page 24th. he tells us, <Q>That &s;till after all there remained heavy upon him the guilt of
<PB N="22" REF="002809_0035_0FE6402D864E51A0">Sin and great Darkne&s;s, and uncertainty about his &s;piritual E&s;tate. I trembled (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) at the thoughts of tho&s;e mi&s;erable <HI>Jews</HI> who pe|ri&s;hed in the Wilderne&s;s, through the ju&s;t Wrath of God, after their deliverance out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and never &s;aw the good Land.</Q></P>
<P>Al&s;o in the &s;ame page he adds as follows.</P>
<P><Q>In my darkne&s;s I applied to my &s;elf almo&s;t in di&s;pair, what God &s;aid to <HI>Pharaoh, Exod.</HI> 9.16. <HI>For this Cau&s;e have I rai&s;ed thee up, that I might &s;hew my wonders in thee.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Page 25th. (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) <Q>The&s;e deep di&s;courage|ments were al&s;o accompanied with the Black|e&s;t Temptations; through the force whereof I was ready to Envy the Salvation of others. This &s;tartled me as what carryed in it the ex|pre&s;s Image of Satan.</Q></P>
<P>In page 30th. he adds, <Q>That for divers years after, he was frequently a&s;&s;aulted with Temp|tations to call all in que&s;tion over again, to con&s;ider whether I had not apo&s;tatized from Chri&s;t and his Truth, which has been no &s;mall annoyance, and the cau&s;e of a great deal of trouble to me, (<HI>&s;ays he.</HI>)</Q></P>
<P>And thus having briefly gone through the ac|count which he gives us of his recovery out of <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> I &s;hall not trouble the Reader with any Expo&s;ition upon it; judging it &s;o plain of it &s;elf, that every Chri&s;tian Reader will be at no lo&s;s to &s;ee that what he calls his being led into <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> was a gracious Call and Invitation of God to his Soul, and had he remained faithful to God, and not fainted under his Per&s;ecutions, he might have been a happy Man. And al&s;o what
<PB N="23" REF="002809_0036_0FE6402D88D33760">he calls his recovery from <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> may as plainly be &s;een to be his Apo&s;tacy. And by the great darkne&s;s and horror that attended him im|mediately upon his Apo&s;tacy, I under&s;tand it to be the &s;ame that attended <HI>Cain, Saul, Judas, Francis Spira,</HI> &amp;c. and is largely threatned again&s;t Apo&s;tates in the 10th. of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> 26, 27. ver&s;es. <HI>For if we Sin wilfully after that we have re|ceived the Knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sins, but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, which &s;hall de|vour the Adver&s;aries.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall add one In&s;tance more for the better &s;a|tisfaction of the Reader, that what he calls his re|covery from <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> was his Apo&s;tacy; &amp; that is his &s;ending to the General A&s;&s;embly at <HI>New|haven,</HI> to inform them, that he had found out the wonderful Art of <HI>Longitude,</HI> which had been hid from Mankind &s;ince the World began: de|&s;iring the A&s;&s;embly to fit and furni&s;h him for a Voyage to <HI>England,</HI> that he might di&s;cover the fame to the Crown, from whom he expected a va&s;t Reward. But the A&s;&s;embly not being taken with his Notion, and he &s;oon finding him&s;elf deceived, betook him&s;elf to Pleading Ca&s;es in the <HI>Common Law</HI> for a living which Calling he follows to this day.</P>
<P>Now according to Chri&s;t's Doctrine, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.21. <HI>For where your trea&s;ure is, there will your heart be al&s;o,</HI> it is evident that <HI>P. P</HI>'s. Heart and Meditati|ons were now &s;et upon Earthly and Carnal Things, and were not in that &s;piritual Frame as when he for&s;ook his Wife, and all Worldly En|joyments that he might plea&s;e God, and gain a trea&s;ure in Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="002809_0037_0FE64033C106BDB8">
Al&s;o the Spirit that he was led by in the time of his Sufferings, cau&s;ed the World to per&s;ecute, mock and revile him; but the Spirit that enters into him immediately upon his Apo&s;tacy, unites him to the World again.</P>
<P>Al&s;o this Spirit which re-enters into him upon his Apo&s;tacy, could not be of God, becau&s;e it was a fal&s;e Spirit, as appears by its deceiving him in the matter of <HI>Longitude,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And &s;o leaving what is above&s;aid to the Con|&s;ideration of the Reader, I &s;hall proceed to his next Article, which is &s;everal <HI>Songs</HI> compo&s;ed in Ver&s;e, in which he pretends to prai&s;e God for his Recovery out of the Errors of <HI>Quakeri&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>This is no other than Apo&s;tates and Hypo|crites were ever wont to do, I mean, hypocriti|cally to imitate God's People in their Songs and Prai&s;es to God; as may be &s;een <HI>Amos</HI> 6.5. <HI>That Chant to the &s;ound of the Viol, and invent to them&s;elves In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick like David,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now &s;ome of the Sins which tho&s;e Hypocrites were charged with, who were thus imitating <HI>David</HI> in his Prai&s;es to God, may be &s;een in the 5th. Chap. of this Prophe&s;ie of <HI>Amos,</HI> at the 12th. Ver&s;e. <HI>For I know your manifold Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and your mighty Sins: they afflict the ju&s;t, they take a Bribe, &amp; they turn a&s;ide the Poor in the gate from their Right.</HI> And in the 23d. ver&s;e &s;aith the Lord, <HI>Take thou away from me the noi&s;es of thy Songs, for I will not hear the Melody of thy Viols; but let Judg|ment run down as Waters, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s as a mighty Stream.</HI> From which Scripture we may ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e apo&s;tatized Hypocrites who&s;e Songs the Lord thus abhorred, were &s;uch as by
<PB N="25" REF="002809_0038_0FE640341E1D5DA8">taking Bribes procured unrighteous Judgments, whereby the <HI>Poor were turned a&s;ide from their Right.</HI></P>
<P>And now as to his <HI>Songs</HI> and other Ver&s;es, I &s;hall be very brief, only mentioning &s;ome of the gro&s;s Bla&s;phemies which they contain, not doubt|ing but all &s;ober Chri&s;tians, together with my &s;elf, will abhor &s;uch Prophane&s;s as may be &s;een in Page 36th. and is as follows.</P>
<Q><L><HI>That Sacramental Bond</HI></L>
<L><HI>by which my Soul was ty'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>To Chri&s;t in Bapti&s;m, I ca&s;t off,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and ba&s;ely Vilifi'd.</HI></L>
<L><HI>I &s;uffer'd to be wa&s;h'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>(as Satan in&s;tituted)</HI></L>
<L><HI>My Body, &s;o my Soul thereby,</HI></L>
<L><HI>became the more polluted.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Now I &s;uppo&s;e he intends by that <HI>Sacramental Bond,</HI> by which he &s;ays his Soul was ty'd to Chri&s;t, that non-&s;criptural Practice of &s;prinkling a little Water out of a Ba&s;on on his Face, in his unregenerate &s;tate. Now the Scriptures a|bundantly &s;hew us, that the Spirit of God is the Bond by which God's Children are &s;ealed or united to him; as <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.13. <HI>In whom al&s;o after that ye believed, ye were &s;ealed with the holy Spirit of Promi&s;e.</HI> Eph. 4.3. <HI>Endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</HI> Ver&s;e 30 <HI>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are &s;ea|led unto the day of Redemption.</HI> 1 Joh. 3.24. <HI>Here|by we know that he abideth in us, by the &s;pirit which he hath given us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002809_0039_0FE6403893E65088">
Thus it plainly appears, that it is the Spirit of God which is the Bond by which God's Chil|dren are united to Chri&s;t, and not by &s;prink|ling a little elementary Water on their Face, as <HI>P. P.</HI> has ignorantly and bla&s;phemou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> Whereas he &s;ays, <Q>He &s;uffered his Body to be wa&s;hed as Satan in&s;tituted:</Q> I &s;uppo&s;e he intends his being Bapti&s;ed according to the Rule of Scripture, of which he gives us an Ac|count in page 18. how that he was &s;tirred up to &s;ubmit to this Ordinance from tho&s;e Words, <HI>Acts</HI> 22.16. <HI>And now why tarrie&s;t thou? ari&s;e and be Bapti&s;ed and Wa&s;h away thy Sins.</HI> And that ac|cordingly he was Bapti&s;ed by burying his Body in the Water.</P>
<P>This is according to the Rule given us in Scripture, relating to the Admini&s;tration of this Ordinance of Bapti&s;m, as may be &s;een <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.4. <HI>Therefore we are buried with him by Bapti&s;m. Col.</HI> 2.12. <HI>Buried with him in Bapti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>And becau&s;e this Ordinance could not be tru|ly Admini&s;tred without a &s;ufficiency of Water to bury the Per&s;on in, we read <HI>John</HI> 3.23. That <HI>John</HI> was Bapti&s;ing in <HI>Enon</HI> near <HI>Salim,</HI> becau&s;e there was much Water there.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> As to the fir&s;t In&s;titutor of this Ordi|nance, we know that <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> was the fir&s;t practi&s;er of it; therefore let us take his Te|&s;timony as to the In&s;titutor of it, which is to be &s;een <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.33. <HI>And I knew him not, but he that &s;ent me to Bapti&s;e with Water, the &s;ame &s;aid unto me, upon whom thou &s;halt &s;ee the Spirit,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And here I &s;uppo&s;e none but <HI>P. P.</HI> will dare to deny that it was God Almighty that in&s;titu|ted

By all which Scriptures it is evident, that it was the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t that in&s;tituted <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> and not Satan, as <HI>P. P.</HI> has bla&s;phemou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>And now I &s;hall proceed to his &s;econd Chap. wherein he pretends to give an account of the principal Heads of <HI>Quakeri&s;m.</HI> As to this Chap. I &s;hall not give any particular An&s;wer, and that for the&s;e following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> Becau&s;e <HI>J. R.</HI> in his life-time did large|ly publi&s;h his Principles in Print, and therefore I &s;hall refer the Reader to his Books; which will &s;ufficiently di&s;cover the abu&s;es done him by <HI>P. P.</HI> now after his Death. And if there be any Per&s;ons that have not &s;een his Books, and are de&s;irous to be &s;atisfied in this matter, I have &s;ufficient by me to &s;upply them.</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;econd</HI> Rea&s;on is, Becau&s;e his account is &s;o confu&s;ed, &s;elf-contradictory and fal&s;e, that it de|&s;erves no An&s;wer. And for the proof of this, take the&s;e following In&s;tances.</P>
<P>In page 48. he tells the Reader as follows: <Q>But <HI>Rogers</HI> held three Ordinances of Religious u&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Bapti&s;m, the Lord's Supper, and im|po&s;ition of Hands. <HI>Of Wor&s;hip in general.</HI></Q></P>
<P>All Wor&s;hip is in the Heart only, and there are no external Forms in which, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (<HI>Rogers.</HI>)</P>
<P>Here the Reader may ob&s;erve, that fir&s;t he owns that <HI>Rogers</HI> held three external Ordinances,
<PB N="28" REF="002809_0041_0FE640440BC398C0"><HI>viz.</HI> Bapti&s;m, the Lord's Supper, and impo&s;ition of Hands; and in the very next Words forgets him&s;elf and tells the Reader, that <HI>Rogers</HI> held all Wor&s;hip to be in the Heart only, and that there was no external Forms. See how plainly he contradicts him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Page 46. he &s;ays as follows, Of <HI>Sanctification, Mortification and Perfection.</HI> Fir&s;t, <HI>Sanctification is a perfect clean&s;ing from Sin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> If <HI>P. P.</HI> will dare to &s;ay, that a Per&s;on which is perfectly clean&s;ed from Sin, is not in a &s;tate of Sanctification, I think the World will condemn his Darkne&s;s; and if he owns it, why then doth he charge it as an Error upon <HI>J. R.?</HI></P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> Says he, <HI>The place of it is before Ju&s;tificati|on.</HI> Here he charges <HI>J. R.</HI> with an Error, for holding that the place of Sanctification is before Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, If God &s;hould ju&s;tify a Sinner before he Sanctifies him, then &s;urely he mu&s;t ju&s;tify him while he remains under the guilt of his Sins, which is both contrary to the pure and holy nature of God, and to the holy Scriptures, as may be &s;een <HI>Exod.</HI> 34.7. <HI>Keeping mercy for thou&s;ands, forgiving Iniquity Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and Sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.</HI> Exod. 23.7. <HI>Keep thee far from a fal&s;e matter, and the Innocent and Righteous &s;lay thou not, for I will not Ju&s;tify the wicked.</HI></P>
<P>By which Scriptures it is evident that the place of Sanctification is before Juftification, (otherwi&s;e God mu&s;t ju&s;tify the wicked.)</P>
<P>Page 49. Speaking of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, at the third Particular, &s;ays he, <HI>They mu&s;t labour
<PB N="29" REF="002809_0042_0FE640440F817F68">with their hands, for the &s;upport of them&s;elves and others.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Here I think he does <HI>J. R.</HI> great un|ju&s;tice, by charging him with this Error, which if it be an Error, he ought to have charged it on the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> who was the Per&s;on that gave the command to Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, as may be &s;een <HI>Acts</HI> 20. At the 17th ver&s;e we have an ac|count, that from <HI>Miletus</HI> he &s;ent to <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> and called the Elders of the Church. And ver&s;e 33, 34. he &s;ets before the&s;e Elders or Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, his own Example, in the&s;e words, <HI>I have coveted no Man's Silver, or Gold, or Apparel: ye your &s;elves know that the&s;e Hands have mini&s;tred to my nece&s;&s;itics, and to them that were with me.</HI></P>
<P>And in the 35th ver&s;e he orders them to do the like, minding them of the words of the Lord Je&s;us, as follows.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewed you all things, how that &s;o labour|ing ye ought to &s;upport the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Je&s;us, how he &s;aid, It is more Ble&s;|&s;ed to give than to receive.</P>
<P>By which Scripture it is plain that it was <HI>Paul</HI> that gave this order to the Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, and ought not to be charged as an Error upon <HI>J. R.</HI></P>
<P>Page 51&s;t. he tells us, <Q>That <HI>J. R.</HI> held downright, that Man had no Soul at all, and that tho' he u&s;ed the Term, yet intended by it either the natural Life, or el&s;e the natural Faculties which he attributed to the Body, and held that they died with it, even as it is with a Dog, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> In an&s;wer to this notorious Fal&s;hood charged upon <HI>J. R.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="002809_0043_0FE6404A525734A8">
I &s;hall boldly appeal to all Mankind who had Conver&s;ation with him in his life-time, for that they well know it to be utterly fal&s;e: And for the Satisfaction of &s;uch as had not acquaintance with him, I &s;hall refer them to his Books, and particularly in this Point to his Expo&s;ition on the <HI>Revelations,</HI> beginning at page 232. where he largely &s;ets forth the Re&s;urrection of the Body, both of the Ju&s;t and unju&s;t, and of the Eternal Judgment which God &s;hall then pa&s;s upon all both &s;mall and great, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>All which &s;ufficiently proves <HI>P. P.</HI> guilty of Slandering and Belying a dead Man, a Crime generally abhorred by all &s;ober People, and &s;o I &s;hall pa&s;s to his 3d. Chap. Judging that by the&s;e few Remarks which have been taken, the Rea|der may plainly &s;ee, that the account he pre|tends to give of <HI>J. R.'s</HI> Principles is &s;o fal&s;e and &s;elf-contradictory, that it de&s;erves no An&s;wer at all; and that it was great folly in <HI>P.

<P>And now we are come to his third Chap, which begins as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Chap. 3.</HI> Giving an account of the unrea&s;onable|ne&s;s of <HI>J. R.'s</HI> boa&s;ting of his Sufferings: And offering &s;ome Advice to &s;uch as hold his Principles of Reli|gion.</P>

<P>I purpo&s;e (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) in this la&s;t Chapter, to make a few Remarks upon &s;ome of <HI>J. R.</HI>'s Sufferings, and the Cau&s;es of them; to the end it may be known, that his Sufferings were not Per&s;ecu|tions, nor for his Religion and Con&s;cience, as he vainly and fal&s;ly boa&s;ted, and as &s;ome 'tis like have believed.</P>
<P>But that really he was him&s;elf a Per&s;ecutor, and that his Sufferings were the demerits of his horrid Immoralities and Impieties.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that he mentioned on the ac|count of his Sufferings, was the divorcing his <HI>Wife</HI> from him. To which I an&s;wer, that the cau&s;e of it was his Adultery, Bea&s;tiality, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in which he had lived for divers years, as he boa&s;ted, and endeavoured partly to Ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>If any in his behalf object, that the proof was in&s;ufficient, I an&s;wer, that neither they nor I are competent to judge of that. And farther, that upon his Tryal, he never denied a tittle of the Charge, and out of Court always own|ed it, and particularly to Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> who was his Council, but thereupon de&s;erted him, and gave an Evidence again&s;t him.</P>
<P>And for the Proof of this, I refer the Reader to the Records and Files in the Secretary's Of|fice at <HI>Hartford.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> As to this fir&s;t charge of <HI>P. P.</HI> again&s;t <HI>J. R.</HI> I &s;hall fir&s;t affirm &amp; then prove, that every Article of it is po&s;itively fal&s;e.</P>
<P>But before I come to my Proof, I &s;hall give the Reader a true account concerning the mat|ter of the fir&s;t difference between <HI>J. R.</HI> and his Wife, as I received it from their own Mouths,
<PB N="32" REF="002809_0045_0FE640553B06BF90">they never differing in any material Point as to the account they gave about it.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it is a hard task for me to give a true Relation of this matter; for that it will &s;o much expo&s;e the Adulterous Life which my dear Mother was drawn into by tho&s;e wicked Per&s;ons, who were the cau&s;e of that Di|vorce.</P>
<P>And although I did faithfully and in the fear of God labour with her in her life-time, by per&s;wa|ding her to for&s;ake her Adulterous Life and un|lawful Companions, yet &s;ince her death, &s;hould have been glad to have heard no more about it, had not <HI>P. P.</HI> like a bad Bird <HI>befowled his own Ne&s;t,</HI> by raking in the Graves of the dead, and by publi&s;hing &s;uch notorious Lies again&s;t them, <HI>whom the Clods of the Valley forbid to an&s;wer for them&s;elves:</HI> For which cau&s;e I am compelled to give a true account concerning tho&s;e things, which are as follow.</P>
<P><HI>John Rogers</HI> and his Wife were both brought up in the <HI>New-England</HI> way of Wor&s;hip, never being acquainted with any other Sect; and al|though they were zealous of the Form which they had been brought up in, yet were wholly ignorant as to the work of Regeneration, until by a fore Affliction which <HI>J. R.</HI> met with, it plea&s;ed God to lay before his Con&s;ideration the vanity of all Earthly things, and the nece&s;&s;ity of making his Peace with God, and getting an In|tere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which he now applies him&s;elf to &s;eek for, by earne&s;t Prayer to God in &s;ecret, and according to Chri&s;t's words, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.7, 8. <HI>Ask and it &s;hall be given you, &s;eek and ye &s;hall
<PB N="33" REF="002809_0046_0FE64055465648B0">find, knock and it &s;hall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that &s;eeketh findeth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And he coming to witne&s;s the truth of the&s;e Scriptures, by Gods giving him a new heart and another Spirit, and by remitting the guilt of his Sins, did greatly engage him to love God with all his heart, and his Neighbour as him&s;elf, as did appear by his warning all People he met with to make their Peace with God, declaring what God had done for his Soul, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And now his Wife ob&s;erving the great Change which was wrought in her Husband, as appear|ed by his fervent Prayers, continual &s;earching the Scriptures, and daily di&s;cour&s;ing about the things of God to all Per&s;ons he met with, and particularly to her, per&s;wading her to for&s;ake her vain Conver&s;ation and make her peace with God, did greatly &s;tir her up to &s;eek to God by earne&s;t Prayer, that he would work the &s;ame work of Grace in her Soul, as &s;he &s;aw and Be|lieved to be wrought in her Husband. And af|ter &s;ome time it plea&s;ed God, graciou&s;ly to an|&s;wer her Prayers, by &s;ending the Spirit of his Son into her Heart, whereby &s;he was able to cry, <HI>Abba Father.</HI> The Spirit of God it &s;elf bearing witne&s;s with her Spirit, that &s;he was a Child of God; according to what is written, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.15, 16.</P>
<P>And now her Husband and her &s;elf, came to be united together in a double Bond of love; for before this there was only the love that is be|tween a Man and his Wife, but now there was the love of the Brotherhood, even that love by
<PB N="34" REF="002809_0047_0FE640564A38DDF8">which God's Children are united together. And in this unity they lived together &s;everal Months, witne&s;&s;ing both to &s;mall and great what God had done for their Souls.</P>
<P>But after &s;ome time, upon their diligent &s;earch|ing the holy Scriptures, they began to doubt of &s;ome of the Principles which they had tradition|ally been brought up in; and particularly that of &s;prinkling Infants, which they had been taught to call <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> but now they find it to be only an invention of Men, and neither Com|mand or Example in Scripture for it: Upon which they bore a publick Te&s;timony again&s;t it, which &s;oon cau&s;ed a great uprore in the Country. And their Relations, together with their Neighbours, and indeed the World in ge|neral who had any opportunity, were all uni|ted in per&s;wading them that it was a Spirit of Error, by which they were deluded: But the main In&s;trument which Satan at length made u&s;e of to deceive <HI>J. R.</HI>'s Wife, was her own natural Mother, who by giving her Daughter an account of her own Conver&s;ion, as &s;he called it, and telling her Daughter there was no &s;uch great Change in the Work of Conver&s;ion, as they had met with; but that it was the Devil had tran&s;formed him&s;elf as an Angel of Light, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And at length fully per&s;waded her Daugh|ter to believe that it was even &s;o. Whereupon &s;he &s;oon publickly recanted, and renounced that Spirit which &s;he had been led by, and declared it to be the Spirit of the Devil; and then vehe|mently per&s;waded her Husband to do the like; telling him with bitter Tears, that unle&s;s he
<PB N="35" REF="002809_0048_0FE640564CB5A598">would renounce that Spirit, &s;he dare not live with him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But he con&s;tantly telling her that he knew it to be the Spirit of God, and that to deny it would be to deny God, which he dare not do, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon &s;he left her Husband, taking her two Children with her, and with the help of her Relations went to her Fathers Hou&s;e, about eighteen miles di&s;tant from her Husband's Habi|tation. And I do &s;olemnly declare in the pre|&s;ence of God, that this is a true Relation of their fir&s;t &s;eparation, as I received it from their own Mouths; as al&s;o by the Te&s;timony of <HI>Daniel Stubbins</HI> and <HI>Mary Tubs,</HI> two of their next Neigh|bours, is fully proved, who&s;e Te&s;timonies are in the foregoing part of this Book.</P>
<P>And &s;o having left her Husband upon the ac|count of his Religion, as has been declared, and Renouncing her Profe&s;&s;ion, &s;he &s;oon returned into her vain Conver&s;ation, and let in a flood of Malice again&s;t her Husbaud. For as Mar|riage is an Ordinance of God, and is often made u&s;e of in Scripture to &s;et forth the union that is between Chri&s;t and his Church; &s;o on the con|trary, where Satan has ever made a breach in that Relation, it is commonly followed with a greater degree of Enmity than is common in o|ther ca&s;es. For &s;oon after &s;he had left her Husband, &s;he declared, that he had given her an account of his former Cour&s;e of Life in his un|converted &s;tate, how he had been the wor&s;t of Sinners, and guilty of many gro&s;s acts of un|cleanne&s;s, which &s;he &s;aid he had particulari&s;ed
<PB N="36" REF="002809_0049_0FE6405B400FD6B0">to her, and which &s;he now makes a Catalogue of, and pre&s;ents to the Authority by way of com|plaint again&s;t her Husband; whereupon her Husband was &s;eized by an Officer, and com|mitted to <HI>Hartford</HI> Goal, for a Tryal at the next Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tants, where &s;he appeared and ten|dered her Oath to confirm the truth of what &s;he had charged him with.</P>
<P>But the Court ob&s;erving what an imbittered &s;pirit &s;he was in again&s;t her Husband, refu&s;ed to give her her Oath to any one Article of her Complaints; yet her Complaints were commit|ted to the Grand Jury, with all the Aggravati|ons which &s;everal Attorney's who were em|ployed for her could invent; But the Grand Ju|ry judging the Charges of a prejudiced Woman again&s;t her Husband to be of no weight, &s;oon returned <HI>Ignoramus,</HI> and that they found not the Bill again&s;t him. Whereupon the Court granted him Goal delivery, and &s;o he was never brought to any Tryal. And for the proof of this, take the following Copy of Record.</P>

<P>Thu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> it appears, that this Court above-men|tioned, granted <HI>John Rogers</HI>'s Wife a Bill of Di|vorce, without giving any rea&s;on why they did it, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be a Precedent not to be Paralleled in the Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And now having given a true and impartial Account of the fir&s;t cau&s;e of <HI>John Rogers</HI>'s Wife leaving her Husband, and al&s;o the other pro|ceedings
<PB N="38" REF="002809_0051_0FE6405F48A689E0">that were in that matter, &s;o far as to the Bill of Divorce.</P>
<P>In the next place I &s;hall make Reply to the &s;everal notorious Fal&s;hoods a&s;&s;erted by <HI>P. P.</HI> concerning this matter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that I &s;hall ob&s;erve is, that he po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, that the cau&s;e of the divorc|ing his Wife from him, was his Adultery, Bea&s;|tiality, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in which he had lived for divers years, as he Boa&s;ted, and endeavoured partly to ju&s;tify, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Here I think I may boldly conclude that he has reference to the&s;e charges laid again&s;t <HI>J. R.</HI> by his Wife; and the rea&s;on why I may well conclude he means &s;o, is becau&s;e I never heard or under&s;tood that ever he was charged with any Mi&s;demeanour in his life before that time.</P>
<P>And for <HI>P. P.</HI> boldly to affirm, that the cau&s;e of the Divorce was for his Adultery and Bea&s;ti|ality, when the Divorce it &s;elf nor any other Re|cord alledges any &s;uch thing to be the Rea&s;on; and al&s;o the Record of that matter proves that he was acquitted by the Grand Jury, and di&s;|mi&s;t by the Court, without &s;o much as being brought to a Tryal. All which proves <HI>P. P</HI>'s. charge to be abominably fal&s;e.</P>
<P>In the next place he adds as follows.</P>
<P>If any in his behalf object, That the proof was in&s;ufficient, I an&s;wer, that neither they nor I are competent to judge of that.</P>
<P>Here he confe&s;&s;es that he is not competent to judge whether the proof was &s;ufficient or not.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That the Jury who had the hearing of it, were competent to judge of
<PB N="39" REF="002809_0052_0FE6405F4AAFAC08">it, and accordingly did, and have left their Judg|ment upon Record, which is the only Rule for all other Per&s;ons to judge by.</P>
<P>But then how abominable is it for <HI>P.P.</HI> who confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf not capable to judge of it, yet has pre&s;umed to judge and condemn a dead Man, in a matter wherein the Court had ju&s;tified him fifty Years pa&s;t, and I &s;uppo&s;e near ten Years before <HI>P. P.</HI> was born: And <HI>farther,</HI> (&s;ays he, &s;peaking of <HI>J. R.) that upon his Tryal, he never de|nied a tittle of the Charge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> This is another po&s;itive Fal&s;hood, in that <HI>J. R.</HI> was never brought upon any Tryal a|bout the matter, as has been &s;ufficiently proved already, yet I confe&s;s that upon his Examinati|on he did not deny any one tittle of his Wife's charges, which is no token of a guilty Per&s;on. He taking his Example from the innocent Lamb of God, who upon his Examination did the like, as may be &s;een, <HI>Mat. 27.13, 14. Then &s;aid Pilate unto him, Heare&s;t thou not how many things they wit|ne&s;s again&s;t thee? And he an&s;wered him to never a word, in &s;o much that the Governour marvelled great|ly.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that it was the Example of Chri&s;t to do the like, &amp; it is well known through|out the World, that guilty Per&s;ons are never wanting in denying the Crime they were char|ged with. Be&s;ides this <HI>J. R.</HI> &s;aw that the Court refu&s;ed to give his Wife her Oath to her char|ges again&s;t him, and therefore it was no Witne&s;s in Law, and altogether needle&s;s for him to deny it, &s;o long as no Witne&s;s was taken again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="002809_0053_0FE640679E4680E8">
He al&s;o a&s;&s;erts that <HI>J. R.</HI> always owned the charge out of Court, and in particular to Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> who was his Coun&s;el, but thereupon de|&s;erted him, and gave an Evidence again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Before I make any particular An&s;wer to the&s;e la&s;t A&s;&s;ertions, I &s;hall give an account concern|ing this <HI>Edwards</HI> which he mentions: And fir&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>P. P.</HI> by not mentioning his Chri&s;tian Name, would have the Reader believe him to be <HI>Richard Edwards,</HI> late of <HI>Hartford,</HI> decea&s;ed, who was a &s;ober Man, given to no Vice, as I know of.</P>
<P>But this <HI>Edwards</HI> which tendered an Evidence again&s;t <HI>J. R.</HI> was one <HI>William Edwards,</HI> a Man notoriou&s;ly given to Drink, as is well known to all the ancient Dwellers at <HI>Hartford.</HI> This Man was never employed by <HI>J. R.</HI> to be his Coun|&s;el; yet he informed the Court, that <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Friends de&s;ired him to &s;peak in his behalf; whereupon the Court admitted him. But <HI>J. R.</HI> not rewarding him as he expected he would, he drew up an Evidence again&s;t him, wherein he declared, that <HI>J. R.</HI> had confe&s;&s;ed to him a gro&s;s act of Uncleanne&s;s: But <HI>J. R.</HI> affirming his Evidence to be &s;al&s;e, and de&s;iring the Court to interrogate him as to the Time and Place, which accordingly they did; and he &s;aid it was at <HI>Hartford,</HI> naming the day of the Month; and the Judges of the Court well knowing that <HI>J. R.</HI> was at the &s;ame time at <HI>New-London,</HI> which is fifty Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Hartford,</HI> did &s;harply check him and command him out of the Court, which I think was a moderate Puni&s;hment for &s;uch a Crime. And this I am told by them that
<PB N="41" REF="002809_0054_0FE64067A74D37E0">were pre&s;ent and &s;aw it; yet for my own &s;atis|faction I went to <HI>Hartford</HI> on purpo&s;e to &s;ee it, and according did &s;ee it among the Complaints of <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Wife, his Oath not being given to it: Which evidenced the truth of what I had heard about it.</P>
<P>And now as to <HI>P. P</HI>'s. a&s;&s;erting that <HI>J. R.</HI> al|ways owned the Charge out of Court, and par|ticularly to Mr. <HI>Edwards.</HI></P>
<P>This I charge to be a Fal&s;hood, and for the proof of it, I &s;hall refer to the Judgment of all who know the Duty of Grand Jurors, and the Cu&s;tom of Courts, who well under&s;tand, that if there had been but one Evidence given under Oath to the Grand Jury, that they had heard <HI>J. R.</HI> own out of Court, that he was guilty of any &s;uch Fact as <HI>P. P.</HI> alledges, they could not by their Oaths have acquitted him, (as they did) but mu&s;t have return'd <HI>Billevera,</HI> and he mu&s;t have been brought to a Tryal: Which is an e|vident proof that this is another Fa&s;hood.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all, he refers the Reader for proof to the Files and Records in the Secretary's Office in <HI>Hartford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> This is an unrea&s;onable Impo&s;ition upon the Readers, in putting them upon a Jour|ney to <HI>Hartford,</HI> there to &s;earch the Records for fifty Years &s;tanding, or they mu&s;t remain as ignorant as they were before they &s;aw his Book.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s it is the wi&s;e&s;t Speech in his Book, &s;ince none will take the pains to do it; and &s;o he hopes to conceal his Lies to the World's end.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="002809_0055_0FE63F8E83145868">
And now I cannot but take notice of <HI>P. P.</HI>'s great Folly, in proving his own Illegitimacy to the World, in a&s;&s;erting, that the Divorce was on the account of his Bea&s;tiality; which if <HI>J. R.</HI> had been guilty of, every Child that can read the Scripture, knows he ought to have been put to Death by the Law of God, whereby his Wife would have been lawfully divorced from him, and might have been married to another Man, and not have been called an Adultere&s;s; accor|ding to what is written, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.2, 3. <HI>For the Woman which hath an Husband, is bound by the law to her Husband &s;o long as he liveth: but if the Hu&s;|hand be dead, &s;he is loo&s;ed from the law of her Hu&s;|hand. So then if while her Husband liveth, &s;he be married to another Man, &s;he &s;hall be called an Adul|tere&s;s,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>P. P.</HI> has been left to act as &s;ometimes it hath happened to Thieves, who in the time of their Theft, have been &s;o much concerned to watch where they expect mo&s;t Danger, and thereby neglecting to look round them, have been &s;urpri&s;ed and taken at unawares: So <HI>P. P.</HI> by watching all Opportunities to mi&s;chief the dead Man, which he is fighting with, has neg|lected to look round him, and thereby has pro|ved him&s;elf a <HI>Ba&s;tard.</HI></P>
<P>And now having fairly proved <HI>P. P</HI>'s. char|ges again&s;t <HI>J. R.</HI> to be po&s;itively fal&s;e in every Article, I &s;hall ob&s;erve to the Reader, how plain it appears that <HI>P. P</HI>'s. end in publi&s;hing tho&s;e Scandals again&s;t <HI>J. R.</HI> was only to expo&s;e his Per&s;on, and not his Religion, &s;ince tho&s;e charges laid again&s;t him by his Wife, had only reference
<PB N="43" REF="002809_0056_0FE64069A40B8DE8">to the time in which he was a Member in the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> or <HI>Independent</HI> Church in <HI>New-Lon|don,</HI> and therefore could be no blemi&s;h to the Profe&s;&s;ion which he lived and dyed in after his &s;eparation from that Church; by which it is evi|dent, that his Malice is only again&s;t the dead Man's Per&s;on.</P>
<P>In the next place I &s;hall proceed to give the Reader an Account of the wo|ful event that followed upon granting of this unlawful Divorce, which was fir&s;t her Marry|ing <HI>P. P.</HI> the reputed Father of the pre&s;ent <HI>P. P.</HI> with whom I am now concerned: And af|ter &s;ome time, having a Child by the &s;aid <HI>Pratt,</HI> &s;he was remarkably &s;mitten by the Hand of God, and the Child taken away by Death, as was <HI>David</HI>'s Child by <HI>Uriah</HI>'s Wife, and &s;he con|tinued to be a monument of Di&s;tre&s;s for many Months, not being able to help or rai&s;e her &s;elf off the Bed on which &s;he lay. In which time of her Di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he al&s;o fell into &s;ore horror and trouble of Con&s;cience on account of her Marry|ing <HI>P. P.</HI> after which time I never heard her ju&s;tify her &s;elf concerning that matter, other|wi&s;e than &s;aying, the Authority was guilty of it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And although the&s;e things were the publick di&s;cour&s;e of the Country in the time of it, yet becau&s;e I would not fill this Volume with more Evidences than needs mu&s;t, I &s;hall prove my a&s;&s;ertion out of the Town-Records of &s;eve|ral Towns where &s;he Recorded her &s;elf the Daughter of <HI>Matthew Gri&s;would,</HI> after &s;he was Married to <HI>P.

<P>In the &s;ame Page &s;ays he,</P>
<P><Q>For the&s;e two Rea&s;ons he has un&s;peakably railed upon and vilified the Authority of the Government, charging them with Adultery in the former, and Per&s;ecution in both.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Here I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that according to my Judgment, there is as much truth contained in this laft Paragraph as in any part of his Book; for if the Railing and Reviling was un&s;peak|able, then it was never &s;poken by <HI>J. R.</HI> which Con&s;truction I doubt not but will be the Judg|ment of all Per&s;ons who had acquaintance with him in his life-time; for it is well known that he was no Railer or Reviler.</P>
<P>And well might he charge the Authority with his Wive's Adultery, &s;ince they were the only cau&s;e of leading her into it, by divorcing her from her lawful Husband, and giving no Rea|&s;on why they did it, and then marrying her to another Man, while her Husband lived; which was the occa&s;ion that both her &s;elf and the Man that &s;he was married to after her Divorce, &s;o publickly confe&s;&s;ed their living together to be Adultery, as has already been proved.</P>
<P>And for as much as the Authority of the Go|vernment did deprive him of his Wife, without giving any Rea&s;on why they did it; which is a &s;ufficient proof that it was only for his Religion; and al&s;o did deprive him of his Children upon the account of his Religion, as has been proved by the Record of Court; well might he charge
<PB N="52" REF="002809_0065_0FE6407C66B4E3C8">them with Per&s;ecution in both.</P>
<P>In Page 56th he goes on as follows.</P>
<P><Q>Another Suffering that he gloried in, was his Whippings and Impri&s;onments; of which to &s;peak particularly, and to &s;hew the crimi|nal Cau&s;es of them, would tire my &s;elf &amp; you.

<P>Thus it plainly appears, that this Affirmati|on concerning <HI>New-London</HI> Meeting-Hou&s;e, is a po&s;itive Fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>He &s;till goes on as follows. <Q>His Whippings there were for mo&s;t audacious Contempt of Authority; his &s;itting on the Gallows was for
<PB N="54" REF="002809_0067_0FE64082000AF898">bla&s;phemous Words; and in &s;hort, he never &s;uffered the lo&s;s of one Hair of his Head by the Authority, for any Article of his Religi|on, nor for the Exerci&s;e of it.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Fir&s;t, he a&s;&s;erts, that his Whippings there, <HI>(viz.)</HI> at <HI>Hartford,</HI> were for mo&s;t audaci|ous Contempt of Authority, but doth not in|form the Reader what the Contempt was; mak|ing him&s;elf the Judge as well as the Witne&s;s, whenas it was only his Bu&s;ine&s;s to have proved what the Contempt was, and to have left the Judgment to the Reader. And for as much as his a&s;&s;ertion is altogether unintelligible, &s;o may it rea&s;onably be expected that my An&s;wer mu&s;t be by &s;uppo&s;ition, and is as follows.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e he intends that Barbarous Cruelty which was acted on <HI>J. R.</HI> while he was a Pri&s;o|ner at <HI>Hartford</HI> in the time of his long Impri&s;on|ment above mentioned, which was &s;o contrary to the Laws of God and Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> that I never could find that they made a Record of that matter, according to Chri&s;t's Words, <HI>John</HI> 3.20. <HI>For every one that doeth Evil, hateth the light,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But <HI>J. R.</HI> has given a large Relation about it, as may be &s;een in his Book entituled, <HI>A mid|night Cry from the Temple of God to the ten Virgins,</HI> from page 13. to 15. where he a&s;&s;erts, that he was taken out of Pri&s;on he knew not for what, and tied to the Carriage of a great Gun, where he had &s;eventy &s;ix &s;tripes on his naked Body, with a Whip much larger than the lines of a Drum, with knots at the ends as big as a Walnut, and in that maimed Condition returned to Pri|&s;on
<PB N="55" REF="002809_0068_0FE6408202EE4A38">again; and his Bed which he had hired at a dear Rate taken from him, and not &s;o much as Straw allowed him to lie on, it being on the 18th. day of the eighth Month called <HI>October,</HI> &amp; very cold Weather.</P>
<P>And although my &s;elf with a multitude of Spectators who were pre&s;ent at <HI>Hartford,</HI> and &s;aw this cruel Act, can te&s;tify to the truth of the account which he gives of it, yet I cannot in|form the Reader on what account it was that he &s;uffered it, or what he was charged with; for as I &s;aid before, I never could find a Record of that matter.</P>
<P>But if it was for Contempt of Authority, as <HI>P. P.</HI> a&s;&s;erts, then I think tho&s;e that inflicted &s;uch a Puni&s;hment were more guilty of Con|tempt again&s;t God, than <HI>J. R.</HI> was of Contempt again&s;t the Authority; for God in his holy Law has &s;trictly commanded Judges not to exceed forty &s;tripes on any account, as may be &s;een <HI>Deut.</HI> 25.3. So that for Judges to exceed forty &s;tripes, is high Contempt again&s;t God.</P>
<P>In the next place he adds, that his &s;itting on the Gallows was for bla&s;phemous Words.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Here again he ought to have informed the Reader what the Words were, which doubt|le&s;s would have been more &s;atisfaction to the Reader, than for <HI>P. P.</HI> to make him&s;elf both Witne&s;s and Judge, and &s;o leave nothing for the Readers to do, but to remain as ignorant as they were before they &s;aw his Book.</P>
<P>And he might as well have &s;aid of the Martyr <HI>Stephen,</HI> that his &s;uffering was for bla&s;phemous Words, as what he &s;ays of <HI>J. R.</HI> for it was but
<PB N="56" REF="002809_0069_0FE5F87BD22BC778">the judgment of <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Per&s;ecutors, that the words were bla&s;phemous, and &s;o it was the judgment of the Martyr <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Per&s;ecutors that he was guilty of &s;peaking bla&s;phemous words, as may be &s;een <HI>Acts</HI> 6.13. <HI>This Man cea&s;|eth not to &s;peak bla&s;phemous Words,</HI> &amp;c. Whereup|on they put him to Death.</P>
<P>In the next place I &s;hall give the Reader an account what the&s;e words were, for which <HI>J. R.</HI> was charged with Bla&s;phemy, the account of which here follows.</P>
<P>He being at a Hou&s;e in <HI>New-London,</HI> where there were many Per&s;ons pre&s;ent, was giving a de&s;cription of the &s;tate of an unregenerate Per|&s;on, and al&s;o of the &s;tate of a &s;anctified Per&s;on; wherein he alledged, that the Body of an unre|generate Per&s;on was a Body of Sin, and that Sa|tan had his Habitation there.</P>
<P>And on the contrary that the Body of a Sanc|tified Per&s;on was Chri&s;t's Body, and that Chri&s;t dwelt in &s;uch a Body. Whereupon one of the Company asked him, whether he intended the humane Body? to which he replyed, that he did intend the humane Body.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Per&s;on replied again, will you &s;ay that your humane Body is Chri&s;t's Body? to which he replied, (clapping his hand on his Brea&s;t) yes, I do affirm that this humane Body is Chri&s;t's Body, for Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed it with his precious Blood; and I am not my own, for I am bought with a price, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon two of the Per&s;ons pre&s;ent gave their Te&s;timony as follows: <Q>We being pre|&s;ent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;aw <HI>John Rogers</HI> clap his Hand on his
<PB N="57" REF="002809_0070_0FE5F844007251A0">Brea&s;t and &s;ay, This is Chri&s;t's humane Body.</Q> But they omitted the other Words which <HI>J. R.</HI> joyned with it. And becau&s;e I was very de&s;irous to have given tho&s;e Te&s;timonies out of the Secretary's Office, I took a Journey to <HI>Hart|ford</HI> on purpo&s;e, but the Secretary could not find them: yet for as much as my &s;elf was pre&s;ent both when the Words were &s;poken, and al&s;o at the Tryal at <HI>Hartford,</HI> I am very confident that I have given them verbatim. And whether or no this was Bla&s;phemy, I de&s;ire not to be the Judge, but am willing to leave the judgment to every unprejudiced and &s;ober Reader; and &s;hall pro|ceed to his next a&s;&s;ertion which is as follows. <Q>And in &s;hort, (&s;ays he) he never &s;uffered the lo&s;s of one hair of his Head by the Authority for any Article of his Religion, nor for the Exerci&s;e of it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> In an&s;wer to this la&s;t extravagant A&s;|&s;ertion, which the whole Neighbourhood knows to be fal&s;e, I &s;hall only mention the Cau&s;es of &s;ome few of his &s;ufferings, which I am &s;ure that both the Records and Neighbourhood will wit|ne&s;s the truth of.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place he lo&s;t his Wife and Chil|dren on the account of his Religion, as has alrea|dy been fully proved.</P>
<P>The next long Per&s;ecution which both him|&s;elf and all his Society &s;uffered for many years, was for refu&s;ing to come to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Meet|ing; upon which account their E&s;tates were ex|treamly de&s;troyed, and their Bodies often im|pri&s;oned.</P>
<PB N="58" REF="002809_0071_0FE5F844D12246B8">
<P>Al&s;o the multitude of Fines and Impri&s;on|ments which he &s;uffered on the account of Bap|ti&s;ing &s;uch as de&s;ired to be Bapti&s;ed after the Ex|ample of Chri&s;t, by burying in the Water. All which Fines and Impri&s;onments were executed in the mo&s;t Rigorous manner. Sometimes the Officer taking him in the dead of Winter, as he came wet out of the Water, committed him to Pri&s;on without a &s;park of Fire, with many o|ther cruel acts which for brevity I mu&s;t omit.</P>
<P>Moreover, the many hundreds of Pounds which the Collectors have taken from him for the maintainance of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Mini&s;ters, which &s;uffering he endured to the day of his Death, and which his Society &s;till &s;uffers.</P>
<P>But for as much as his &s;ufferings continued more than forty Years, and were &s;o numerous, that I doubt not but to give a particular account of them, would fill a larger volume than was e|ver Printed in <HI>New-England,</HI> I mu&s;t de&s;i&s;t, and &s;hall only mention the la&s;t &s;uffering which he met with from the Authority on account of his Religion, and was but a little time before his Death, and is as follows. <HI>J. R.</HI> and divers of his Society having as good a Right to <HI>New-Lon|don</HI> Meeting hou&s;e as any of the Inhabitants of the Town, it being built by a publick Rate, eve|ry one paying their Proportion according to their E&s;tate, did propo&s;e to hold his Meetings there at Noon-time, between the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Meetings, &s;o as not to di&s;turb them in either of their Meetings; and accordingly we came to the Meeting-hou&s;e, and finding their Meeting was not fini&s;hed, we &s;tood without the door till they
<PB N="59" REF="002809_0072_0FE5F8459FE9DC60">had ended and were come out, and then <HI>J. R.</HI> told the People that our coming was to hold our Meeting between their Meetings, and that we had no de&s;ign to make any di&s;turbance, but would break up our Meeting as &s;oon as they were ready for their After-noon Meeting. Whereupon &s;everal of the Neighbours manife&s;t|ed their freedom in the matter; yet the Con&s;ta|ble came in the time of our Meeting, with an Order to break up our Meeting, and accord|ingly with his attendance violently laid hands on &s;everal of us, hauling Men and Women out of the Meeting like as <HI>Saul</HI> did in his unconver|ted &s;tate, as may be &s;een <HI>Acts</HI> 3.3. And for no other Crime than what I have here truly related, <HI>J. R.</HI> was had to Court, and charged with a Riot, tho' all that he did was to expound a Chapter in the Bible, and all that his People did was to &s;it &s;till and attend to his Expo&s;ition, till the Con&s;table with his Attendance made the Di&s;turbance, as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>So that if my &s;elf had been the Judge, as I was not, I &s;hould have thought the Con&s;table to have been guilty of the Riot, and not <HI>J. R.</HI> However <HI>J. R.</HI> was fined ten Shillings, for which the Officer fir&s;t took ten Sheep, and then complained that they were not &s;ufficient to an|&s;wer the Fine and Charges, whereupon he came a &s;econd time and took a milch Cow out of the Pa&s;ture on the &s;ame account, and &s;o we heard no more about it, by which I &s;uppo&s;e that the Cow and ten Sheep &s;atisfied the Fine and Char|ges.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="002809_0073_0FE5F8466FA15C00">
And I mention this Article of his &s;ufferings, becau&s;e it was the la&s;t Fine that was laid on him, for he &s;oon after dyed.</P>
<P>But the &s;ame Spirit of Per&s;ecution under which he &s;uffered, is yet living among us; as is evident by what here follows. The la&s;t 5th. Month called <HI>July,</HI> in the year 1725. We were going to our Meeting, being eight of us in num|ber, it being the fir&s;t day of the Week, the day which we u&s;ually meet on, as well as the re&s;t of our Neighbours; and as we were in our way, we were taken up on the King's High-way, by order of <HI>Jo&s;eph Backus,</HI> called a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and the next day, by his order, cruelly whipt with an unmerciful In&s;trument, by which our Bodies were exceedingly wounded and maimed; and the next fir&s;t day following, as we were returning home from our Meeting, we were again three of us taken up on the King's High-way, by order of <HI>John Woodward</HI> and <HI>Eben|ezer We&s;t</HI> of <HI>Lebanon,</HI> called Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and the next day by them &s;entenced to be whipt, and were accordingly carried to the place of Execution, and &s;tript in order to receive the Sentence; but there happening to be pre&s;ent &s;ome tender &s;pirited People, who &s;eeing the Wounds in our Bodies which we had received the Week before, paid the Fine, and &s;o preven|ted the Puni&s;hment. Al&s;o the &s;ame <HI>John Wood|ward</HI> &s;oon after this, committed two of our Brethren to Pri&s;on, (<HI>viz</HI>) <HI>Richard Man</HI> and <HI>Eli|&s;ha Man,</HI> for not attending the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Meet|ing, although they declared it to be contrary to their Con&s;ciences &s;o to do. Neither have their
<PB N="61" REF="002809_0074_0FE5F84745DAB3F8">Per&s;ecutors allowed them one meal of Victua's, nor &s;o much as Straw to lie on, all the time of their Impri&s;onment, altho' they are well known to be very poor Men.</P>
<P>But to return to the Matter I was upon, which was to prove <HI>P. P</HI>'.s A&s;&s;ertion fal&s;e, in &s;aying <HI>J. R.</HI> never &s;uffered the lo&s;s of one Hair of his Head by the Authority, for any Article of his Religion, nor for the Exerci&s;e of it: Whenas all the&s;e Sufferings which I have mentioned, were for Articles of his Religion, and for the Exer|ci&s;e of it. And had not <HI>P. P.</HI> been bereft as well of Common Rea&s;on as Con&s;cience, he would not have pre&s;umed to have a&s;&s;erted &s;uch a thing, which the generality of the Neighbour|hood knows to be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>In the next place I &s;hall proceed to his 58th Page, where in his <HI>I&s;hmaeliti&s;h</HI> Language he pre|tends to give a Relation concerning <HI>J. R</HI>'.s &s;e|cond Marriage: But before I trace him in his Mocks and Scoffs, I &s;hall give the Reader a true and impartial Account of that matter, which is as follows.</P>
<P>After <HI>J. R</HI>'s. fir&s;t Wife had le&s;t him on ac|count of his Religion, as has already been prov|ed, he remained &s;ingle for more than twenty five years, in hopes that &s;he would come to Re|pentance, and for&s;ake her unlawful Compani|ons. But &s;eeing no Change in her, he began to think of Marrying another Woman, and accor|dingly did agree upon Marriage with a Maid belonging to <HI>New-London,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Mary Ransford.</HI> And for as much as he could not in Con&s;cience conform to the Cu&s;tomary
<PB N="62" REF="002809_0075_0FE5F84816035870">Form of Marriage practiced in <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colo|ny, having publickly oppo&s;ed them, and openly in Court declared that he did utterly renounce all the vi&s;ible Wor&s;hip of <HI>New-England,</HI> for more than twenty years before, upon which account he had lo&s;t his Children, as has already been proved; and there being no Per&s;on in the Go|vernment that would Marry them in any other Form, they thereupon agreed to go into the County Court, and there declare their Marri|age: and accordingly they did &s;o; he leading his Bride by the Hand into Court, where the Judges were &s;itting, and a multitude of Specta|tors pre&s;ent, and then de&s;ired the whole A&s;&s;em|bly to take notice, that he took that Woman to be his Wife; his Bride al&s;o a&s;&s;enting to what he &s;aid. Whereupon the Judge offered to Marry them in their Form, which <HI>J. R.</HI> refu&s;ed, telling him that he had once been Married by their Authority, and by their Authority they had ta|ken away his Wife again, and rendered him no Rea&s;on why they did it. Upon which account he looked at their Form of Marriage to be of no value, and therefore would be Married by their Form no more, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And from the Court he went to the Governour's Hou&s;e, with his Bride, and de|clared their Marriage to the Governour, who &s;eemed to like it well enough, and wi&s;hed them much Joy, which is a u&s;ual Compliment.</P>
<P>And thus having given a true and impartial Relation of the manner of his Marriage to his &s;econd Wife, which I doubt not but every un|prejudiced Per&s;on will judge as authentick as any Marriage that was ever made in <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colony.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="002809_0076_0FE5F848E58E9020">
In the next place I &s;hall proceed to inform the Reader in what manner he came to be de|prived of this his &s;econd Wife, for after they had lived together about three years, and had had two Children, the Court had up <HI>J. R</HI>'s. Wife, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">arged her with Fornication, for having her la&s;t Child, pretending no other Rea&s;on, than that the Marriage was not Lawful; and there|upon called her <HI>Mary Ransford,</HI> after her maiden Name.</P>
<P>And then vehemently urged her to give her Oath who was the Father of her Child, which they charged to be by Fornication, her Husband &s;tanding by her in the Court with the Child in his Arms, &s;trictly commanded her not to take the Oath, for the&s;e three following Rea&s;ons. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e it was contrary to Chri&s;t's Com|mand, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.34. <HI>But I &s;ay unto you, Swear not at all,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;econd</HI> Rea&s;on was, becau&s;e it was a vain Oath, in as much as they had been Married &s;o publickly, and then lived together three years after, and that he him&s;elf did not deny his Child, nor did any Per&s;on doubt who was the Father of the Child, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>third</HI> Rea&s;on was, he told her they laid a &s;nare for her, and wanted her Oath to prove their Charge, which was, that the Child was by Fornication; &s;o that her Swearing would be that he was the Father of that Child by Forni|cation, and &s;o it would not only be a Reproach to him and the Child, but al&s;o a fal&s;e Oath, for as much as the Child was not by Fornication.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="002809_0077_0FE5F849B79435E0">
For the&s;e Rea&s;ons he forbid her taking the Oath, but bid her tell the Court, that her Hus|band was the Father of that Child in his Arms. He al&s;o told her in the Court, that if &s;he would be ruled by him, he would defend her from any damage.</P>
<P>But if &s;he would joyn with the Court again&s;t him, by being a Witne&s;s that the Child was by Fornication, he &s;hould &s;cruple to own her any more as a Wife.</P>
<P>But the Court continuing to urge her to take the Oath, promi&s;ing her favour if &s;he took it, &amp; threatning her with &s;everity if &s;he refu&s;ed to take it, at length &s;he declared that &s;he would not be ruled by <HI>J.

<P>And now the poor Woman finding that by her Oath &s;he had proved her Child illegitimate, and thereby denied her Marriage, and that her Husband dare not own her as a Wife; for I think that no Woman can be &s;aid to be a Wife, (though ever &s;o lawfully married) if &s;he turn &s;o much again&s;t her Husband, as not only to di&s;|obey his mo&s;t &s;trict Commands, but al&s;o to prove by her Oath, that his Children are by Fornica|tion as it was in this ca&s;e.</P>

<P><PB N="67" REF="002809_0080_0FE5F84C2A5D65E0">
Thus it appears by comparing the date of his Marriage with the date of his Wive's Marriage to <HI>Robert Jones,</HI> that he remained &s;ingle four Years after &s;he was married.</P>
<P>And this is a true account of his two la&s;t Marriages.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>P. P.</HI> who &s;eems to rou&s;e up his Courage, as if he intended to venture ano|ther Stroke at the dead Man with whom he is fighting, before he takes to his heels, and there|upon arms him&s;elf like an <HI>I&s;hmaelite,</HI> with Mocks and Scoffs; tho' all the Revenge he can promi&s;e him&s;elf thereby, is to move &s;ome vain &s;pirited Per&s;on like him&s;elf to a Laughter.</P>
<P>And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> he begins as follows. <Q>But before I conclude, let me mention &s;ome other of his Sufferings, which tho' he fretted at at home, yet never complained of publickly; I mean what happened to him about his Maid <HI>Mary Ransford,</HI> whom he fir&s;t bought, then took to his Bed, <HI>(at lea&s;t when he wanted her)</HI> till &s;he proved with Child, and in the fifth or &s;ixth Month of her pregnancy, as I remember, he &s;olemnly betrothed her to him; then after|wards dwelling with her &s;everal years, and having had two Children by her, upon &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t put her away, and all by his own Au|thority, agreeable to that Rule in the Law, at lea&s;t in one Re&s;pect, that in the &s;ame way that a Contract is made, it may be made void.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> As to what he &s;ays that he fir&s;t bought her, I grant to be true, which is an Argument that no Per&s;on had any challenge to her, and
<PB N="68" REF="002809_0081_0FE5F84CF9C4ECD8">therefore no ways unlawful for him to Marry her.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> Says he, <Q>Then took to his Bed, at lea&s;t when he wanted her.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> This I take to be a fal&s;e and la&s;civious Speech.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it is fal&s;e, becau&s;e their fir&s;t Child was not born within the limited time which the Law allows after their Marriage, nor were they ever charged with Fornication, nor any unclean act relating to their fir&s;t Child: and as to his taking her to his Bed after he had Married her, no body doubts of it.</P>
<P>Yet to &s;ay a Man takes his Wife to Bed when he wants her, I &s;uppo&s;e all mode&s;t People will take to be a la&s;civious &s;peech.</P>
<P>In the next place he confe&s;&s;es, that after he had &s;olemnly betrothed her to him, he lived with her &s;everal years, &amp; had two Children by her, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here he plainly proves what I have already a&s;&s;er|ted, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the Courts puni&s;hing her, was only on the account of their Marriage, becau&s;e <HI>J. R.</HI> could not in Con&s;cience be Married in their Form, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He al&s;o adds, that upon &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t he put her away, and all by his own Authority, agree|able to that Rule, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that in the &s;ame way that a Contract is made, it may be made void.</P>
<P>This I affirm to be a po&s;itive Fal&s;hood, for it was the Authority of the Court which terrified her &s;o as to cau&s;e her to renounce her Hu&s;|band, and flee into another Government, and marry another Man, as has already been pro|ved.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="002809_0082_0FE5F84DCD7CAEB8">
And as to his Rule in the Law, it is very ap|plicable to the taking away of <HI>J. R.</HI>'s fir&s;t Wife; for it was the Authority that married her to him, and the &s;ame Authority took her from him, without giving a Rea&s;on why they did it.</P>
<P><Q>After which (<HI>&s;ays be</HI>) he was lawfully Mar|ried to a Woman of <HI>Oy&s;ter-Bay.</HI> He al&s;o adds, That he is not at all at a lo&s;s how <HI>J. R.</HI> and this <HI>Quaker</HI> Woman overlook'd the &s;mall di&s;|parity in Religion that was between them, &s;o as to match together; but by what &s;ophi&s;try he levelled that horrible Jogg in his Conver&s;a|tion, re&s;pecting <HI>Mary</HI> afore&s;aid, I cannot ima|gine.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I &s;hall <HI>fir&s;t</HI> inform the Reader what the horrible Jogg was, and <HI>&s;econdly</HI> how it came to be removed.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The horrible Jogg was tho&s;e horrible Lies which <HI>P. P.</HI> has now pre&s;umed to Print, which had been &s;pread about the Country, as if <HI>J. R.</HI> had turned away his Wife; and the way that it came to be removed, was by carrying the Woman to <HI>Block I&s;land,</HI> where &s;he might not only have opportunity of di&s;cour&s;ing with his Wife, who had left him twelve years, and had been Married four years to another Man, but al&s;o with the Authority and Neighbours, and &s;o the horrible Jogg came to be levelled; that is, the horrible Lies came to be di&s;covered to the Woman, and they were Married on the I&s;land before they came off.</P>
<P>And now he proceeds in his <HI>I&s;hmaeliti&s;h</HI> Lan|guage as follows.</P>
<Q><PB N="70" REF="002809_0083_0FE5F84E9E002918">
<P>To me I remember he accounted for it after this &s;ort: &s;aid he, I have experienced wonder|ful operations of Gods hand upon my Body as well as upon my Soul, and &s;o proceeding &s;igni|fied to me, that upon his entering into a &s;tate of &s;uffering, he felt &s;uch a marvellous mortifica|tion of his members which were upon the Earth, as that his venereal Propen&s;ity in particular &s;eemed to be totally extingui&s;hed. But how|ever after he had encountered the &s;harpe&s;t of his Tryals, it flamed forth again, even beyond the limits of Nature, whereby it was manife&s;t, that God's hand was in an eminent way in it. Whereupon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And I never could get him an inch farther than this, yet he would not make a full &s;top neither, but &s;ignified to me, that in a more convenient time he would let me into that My&s;tery, and fully convince me that he did it by a divine Impul&s;e from fir&s;t to la&s;t. I gue&s;s he told Capt. <HI>Wetherell,</HI> who was then Judge of the Court, &s;omething of this &s;to|ry, by the Judge's An&s;wer to him in Court.</P>
<P>You &s;hall hear the Rounds of the matter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It was thus, at a County Court at <HI>New-London,</HI> my &s;elf a Spectator, with a multitude of others being pre&s;ent, came <HI>J. R.</HI> into Court, leading in his hand <HI>Mary</HI> afore&s;aid, and ap|plying him&s;elf to the Judges, &s;aid thus, (<HI>viz.</HI>) I de&s;ire you all to take notice, that I take this my Servant Maid to be my Wife; I bought her with my Money, and I take her to be my Wife. Replied the Judge, How? how? What do you mean <HI>John?</HI> why are you not Publi&s;h|ed and Married in an orderly way? Continu|ed
<PB N="71" REF="002809_0084_0FE5F84FDF8DE180">he, I do not regard your Laws in that re|&s;pect, nor will I be Married by your Authori|ty. Then applying him&s;elf directly to the Judge, &s;aid, Captain <HI>Wetherell,</HI> thou knowe&s;t &s;omething of the occa&s;ion of this, for I hinted it to thee at &s;uch a time. Replyed the Judge, <HI>Why thou filthy Bea&s;t, I know nothing that thou told|e&s;t me, but of a ba&s;e Pang of Lu&s;t that be&s;et thee; go for &s;hame, be gone, the Court will not be hin|dred.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> As to the fir&s;t part of tho&s;e Mocks and Scoffs, in which he pretends <HI>J. R.</HI> gave him an account concerning his Marrying his &s;econd Wife, I &s;hall fir&s;t give the Reader a true and ex|act account of what it was that <HI>J. R.</HI> told him, and the whole of it.</P>
<P>And <HI>2dly.</HI> I &s;hall offer &s;ome Rea&s;ons to con|vince the Reader, that the account I give is true, and that his Account is fal&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to what <HI>J. R.</HI> told him, my &s;elf be|ing pre&s;ent, with divers others, <HI>P. P.</HI> asked him concerning his &s;econd Marriage, after he had &s;o long lived &s;ingle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>J. R.</HI> told him that after he was unju&s;tly de|prived of his Wife, it plea&s;ed God to give him the gift of Continency for more than twenty years, after which time he thought it to be the Will of God for him to Marry again.</P>
<P>And this I affirm to be the whole of what he told him.</P>
<P>Now to &s;atisfy the Reader that this account is true, and that <HI>P. P</HI>'s. Relation is fal&s;e, take the&s;e following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="002809_0085_0FE5F8510C694AB8">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e <HI>J. R.</HI> was never addicted to u&s;e &s;uch foul and extravagant Language, but was always mode&s;t in his Di&s;cour&s;e, as I doubt not but the greate&s;t of his Enemies will readily wit|ne&s;s in his behalf.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> No Rational Per&s;on will &s;uppo&s;e, that a Man of his Under&s;tanding, would frame &s;uch Mocks and Scoffs again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> A third Rea&s;on is, That were the ac|count he gives tran&s;lated out of his <HI>I&s;hmaeliti&s;h</HI> and debaucht Language, into a civil Tongue, it might expre&s;s near the &s;ame thing as my ac|count has done.</P>
<P>By the&s;e three Rea&s;ons it is plain that the ac|count he pretends to give of this matter, is no|thing el&s;e but &s;ome of his <HI>I&s;hmaeliti&s;h</HI> Arrows &s;hot at his imagined Enemy.</P>
<P>And I do freely appeal to every Reader, who is endowed but with common Morality, whe|ther this civil An&s;wer of <HI>J. R.</HI> to <HI>P. P</HI>'s. Que&s;ti|on, de&s;erves all tho&s;e Mocks, Scoffs, Flouts and Deri&s;ions which <HI>P. P.</HI> has ca&s;t upon him: or whether it is not the expre&s;s Image of the mo&s;t la&s;civious debaucht and unmanly &s;pirit of a Coward, thus to in&s;ult and trample upon the Grave of a dead Man.</P>
<P>And now having di&s;gorged him&s;elf of thus much of his debaucht Meditations, and father|ed it upon <HI>J. R.</HI> he prepares him&s;elf for another Vomit of the &s;ame matter, which he thinks to Father upon Capt. <HI>Wetherell,</HI> Judge of the Court, another dead Man, <HI>Whom the Clods of the Valley forbid to an&s;wer for him&s;elf,</HI> and accordingly pro|ceeds as follows; You &s;hall hear the Rounds of
<PB N="73" REF="002809_0086_0FE5F851DF668360">the matter, and &s;o goes on as has already been &s;hown, till he comes to the&s;e following words.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Replied the Judge,</HI> Why thou filthy Bea&s;t, I know nothing thou tolde&s;t me, but of a ba&s;e pang of Lu&s;t that be&s;et thee; go for &s;hame, be gone, the Court will not be hindered.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> That the&s;e la&s;civious Words were ne|ver &s;poken by the Judge of the Court, but pro|ceeded out of his own unclean Heart, is very obvious, for the&s;e two Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> For that it is altogether uncredible to &s;uppo&s;e that an elderly Man, who was Judge of a Court, &s;hould be &s;o notoriou&s;ly debauched and abu&s;ive, as to tell a Man who came civily into his Pre&s;ence to be publickly married, that it was nothing but a ba&s;e pang of Lu&s;t that be&s;et him, and call him <HI>flthy Bea&s;t,</HI> and bid him be gone: Surely it would be a great abu&s;e to the Judge of a Court after his Death, to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a thing of him: E&s;pecially &s;ince there is no better proof of it than <HI>P. P</HI>'s. bare Word, which has been proved fal&s;e throughout his whole Book.</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;econd</HI> Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e it &s;o exactly a|grees with the reft of his debauched Di&s;cour&s;e throughout his Book, that any one may boldly &s;ay it is <HI>P. P</HI>'s. Language, for his Speech bewray|eth him.</P>
<P>And now I can do no le&s;s than blame <HI>P. P.</HI> for that he neither attends the Rule of Scrip|ture nor proper Speech; and yet in Page 39th. upbraids <HI>J. R.</HI> with the &s;ame thing, (<HI>viz.</HI>) for not attending the Rules of Speech in his Books.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="002809_0087_0FE5F852AE0C96E8">
Now had <HI>P. P.</HI> attended the Rule of Scrip|ture which &s;ays, <HI>Judge your &s;elves,</HI> he would not have been judging a dead Man, who is gone into the hands of a righteous Judge.</P>
<P>And <HI>2dly.</HI> Had he attended the Rules of Speech, he would not have called Marriage a ba&s;e pang of Lu&s;t, &s;ince it is written, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.4. <HI>Marriage is honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled; but Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge.</HI> By which we may ob&s;erve, that Marriage is an Ordinance of God, and is not a ba&s;e pang of Lu&s;t; but Whoredom and Adultery is a ba&s;e pang of Lu&s;t: And had he attended the&s;e two Rules, he mu&s;t have confe&s;&s;ed, that him&s;elf was more properly the Effect of a ba&s;e pang of Lu&s;t, than <HI>J. R</HI>'s. marrying a &s;econd Wife, after he had been unju&s;tly deprived of his Wife for more than twenty five Years.</P>
<P>But to follow him to the end of this Di&s;|cour&s;e, (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) <Q>In about three or four Months as I remember, <HI>Mary</HI> brought him a Child, he owned it, and got her with Child again, hav|ing &s;uffered Per&s;ecution for the fir&s;t according to Law; fore&s;eeing the &s;econd Per&s;ecution, he charged <HI>Mary</HI> not to lay the Child to him, if examined by Authority, &s;he promi&s;ed him &s;he would not, but failed of her Word; which occa&s;ioned him farther &s;ufferings for his Con|&s;cience; which &s;o roiled him, that he put her away, and dwelt no more with her.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> As to what he fir&s;t a&s;&s;erts, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That <HI>Mary</HI> brought him a Child in three or four Months, and that he &s;uffered Per&s;ecution for it according to Law, is abominably fal&s;e; for the
<PB N="75" REF="002809_0088_0FE5F853815775C8">Authority never charged <HI>J. R.</HI> or his Wife with any Mi&s;demeanour relating to their fir&s;t Child, as has already been declared. And as to what he &s;ays that he charged her not to lay the Child to him, if examined by Authority, and that &s;he promi&s;ed him &s;he would not, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is not only fal&s;e, but &s;o non&s;en&s;ical and fooli&s;h, that it de|&s;erves no An&s;wer: For what Per&s;on of common Rea&s;on will believe, that after he had been married in the King's Court, before a multitude of Spectators, as <HI>P. P.</HI> confe&s;&s;es in the &s;ame page, and then live with his Wife three Years, until he had had two Children by her, &amp; then charge his Wife not to lay his la&s;t Child to him; &s;ure|ly none will believe &s;uch Folly. And whereas he &s;ignifies, that his &s;econd Child was the occa|&s;ion of his &s;uffering for Con&s;cience, I confe&s;s to be true; for it was on account of his &s;econd Child, that his Wife was &s;entenced to be whipt, for which &s;he fled out of the Colony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And that it was for his Con&s;cience is evident, in that he could not in Con&s;cience be married according to the Cu&s;tom practiced in <HI>Connecti|cut</HI> Colony, which was the only Crime alledg|ed again&s;t him, relating to that matter.</P>
<P>And whereas he &s;ays, that he put her away, and dwelt no more with her; that he put her away is fal&s;e, for &s;he denied him and left him, and married another Man, but that he dwelt no more with her is true, for &s;he lives with the &s;ame Man to this Day.</P>
<P>And now having followed him thus far thro' his Mocks, Scoffs and Fal&s;hoods, in which he has been in&s;ulting and &s;porting him&s;elf over a
<PB N="76" REF="002809_0089_0FE5F854D6DCE3D8">dead Per&s;on, a Crime &s;o contemptible, that nothing but the ba&s;e and unmanly Spirit of a Coward could have endured to have done.</P>
<P><HI>In the next place I can do no le&s;s than mind him of the &s;evere Threatnings contained in the holy Scriptures, again&s;t &s;uch Per&s;ons as he is; who &s;hall pre&s;ume to &s;port them&s;elves by mock|ing and &s;coffing at God's faithful Children af|ter their Death, as he has done; which is to be &s;een</HI> I&s;ai. <HI>57.1, 2, 3, 4. Ver&s;es.</HI> The righteous pe|ri&s;heth and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none con&s;idering that the righte|ous is taken away from the evil to come. He &s;hall en|ter into peace, they &s;hall re&s;t in their beds, each one walking in his uprightne&s;s. But draw near hither ye &s;ons of the Sorcere&s;s, the &s;eed of the Adulterer and the WHORE. Again&s;t whom do ye &s;port your &s;elves? again&s;t whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the Tongue? Are ye not Children of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, a &s;eed of fal&s;hood? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears, that God will &s;urely call &s;uch Per&s;ons as <HI>P. P.</HI> to an account, for &s;porting them&s;elves with their Fal&s;hoods at his People af|ter their death.</P>
<P>In page 61. he endeavours to excu&s;e his &s;ully|ing the Character of the dead as follows, <Q>Me|thinks when we are engaged in the Cau&s;e of Truth again&s;t Error, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it may be very war|rantable, yea, nece&s;&s;ary, and more e&s;pecially where the ca&s;e is peculiar as this is, that a Man boa&s;ting of Perfection, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould deliberate|ly practice Whoredom, and live in it divers years, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="002809_0090_0FE5F855F925E5E8">
<HI>Reply.</HI> But in&s;tead of being engaged in the cau&s;e of Truth again&s;t Error, he has been en|gaged in Lies again&s;t Truth, as has &s;ufficiently been proved throughout his Book, both by the plain Records of the Courts, and other &s;ufficient Evidence.</P>
<P>And as to what he &s;ays of <HI>J. R</HI>'s. deliberately practi&s;ing Whordom, and living in it divers years, it is manife&s;t that he has Reference to the three years that he enjoyed his &s;econd Wife, be|fore &s;he was driven from him; for as I &s;aid be|fore, after he was deprived of his fir&s;t Wife, he lived &s;ingle twenty five years, and then Married his &s;econd Wife, which he enjoyed but three years before he was deprived of her, and then re|mained &s;ingle again twelve years before he Mar|ried his third Wife: So that he was &s;uffered to keep a Wife but three years in forty, which three years is the time that <HI>P. P.</HI> charges him with deliberately practi&s;ing Whoredom. For he was never charged with Whoredom the whole &s;even and thirty years that he lived &s;ingle.</P>
<P>And I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>P. P.</HI> forgets that he has &s;everal times in his Book owned her to be his Wife, as in page fifty eight, where he &s;ays, <Q>He &s;olemn|ly betrothed her to him, then afterwards dwelling with her &s;everal years, and having had two Children by her, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Here he plain|ly confe&s;&s;es, that it was after &s;he was &s;olemnly betrothed to him, that he had two Children by her; and yet in the turning over but one leaf forgets him&s;elf, and calls it deliberately practi|&s;ing Whoredom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And thus is he left through
<PB N="78" REF="002809_0091_0FE5F856CC8BF1D0">the fal&s;e and envious &s;pirit by which he is acted, to confound his own di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>In page 62 he pretends to apply him&s;elf to &s;uch as are already fallen into the &s;nare of that Fowler, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But I &s;hall pa&s;s over much of this Di&s;cour&s;e, judging it &s;o non&s;en&s;ical and contra|ry to the Scripture, that every Per&s;on of a com|mon Capacity will ea&s;ily di&s;cern the Folly of it.</P>
<P>In page 66. &s;ays he, <Q>Again, be per&s;waded to take a view of <HI>J. R.</HI> and try whether he were a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t or not, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In trying of his Authority to Preach and Baptize, I think you may &s;afely conclude that the Office of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter is like that of a Prie&s;t, in this re&s;pect, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that <HI>no Man takes the honour of it upon him&s;elf but he that is called of God, as was</HI> Aaron. Heb. 5.4. Wherefore the Apo&s;tle &s;ays plainly, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.15. <HI>How &s;hall they Preach except they be &s;ent.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> That all Gods Mini&s;ters both in the time of the Law and Go&s;pel have been called of God, as was <HI>Aaron,</HI> I grant, and on the contrary all fal&s;e Teachers and Hirelings which the World heaps up to them&s;elves, have always had their call from an earthly Power, and are not called of God as was <HI>Aaron,</HI> and as to what is written <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.15. <HI>How &s;hall they Preach except they be &s;ent?</HI> (that is &s;ent of God) by which I un|der&s;tand that none can Preach the My&s;teries of God's Kingdom, but &s;uch who are &s;ent of God, and to &s;uch God reveals his Mind and Will; &s;o that they are capable to deliver their Me&s;&s;age from his Mouth, and have no need to &s;tudy vain
<PB N="79" REF="002809_0092_0FE5F8579BA67208">Words out of their own Heart, as fal&s;e Prophers and Hirelings have always done, as may be &s;een, <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.16. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord of bo&s;ts, Hearken not to the Words of the Prophets that prophe&s;y unto you, they make you vain, they &s;peak a vi&s;ion of their own beart, and not out of the Mouth of the Lord.</HI> 2 Pet. 2.1. <HI>But there were fal&s;e Prophets al&s;o among the People,</HI> &amp;c. Ver&s;e 3. <HI>And through Covetou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall they with feigned Words make Merchandize of you.</HI> Thus the Scriptures &s;hew us, that fal&s;e Prophets who are not &s;ent of God, are they who through Covetou&s;ne&s;s Preach &s;tudied or feigned Words out of their own Heart, and not from the Mouth of the Lord. For they are not called of God as was <HI>Aaron,</HI> and therefore are Ignorant of his Mind and Will.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> Says he, That the call of God thereto is either fir&s;t, extraordinary as God called divers of the Prophets of old, and as Chri&s;t called the A|po&s;tles, who always proved their Authority by Miracles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Or <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> it is ordinary, (<HI>viz.</HI>) by Ordinati|on and laying on of the Hands of the <HI>Presbytery, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And every Man pretending to that Office, has always been able to prove his Authority in the one or other of the&s;e ways, excepting a few &s;uch as <HI>George Fox</HI> and <HI>John Rogers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> As Apo&s;tates and Hereticks have ever been the fitte&s;t In&s;truments for Satan to &s;pread his damnable Doctrines abroad by, &s;o I know of no Here&s;y more dangerous than this now broacht by <HI>P. P.</HI> For if we are to reject, as he would have us, all Prophets and Go&s;pel Mini|&s;ters,
<PB N="80" REF="002809_0093_0FE5F858D21E4670">who cannot prove their Authority either by Miracles or Ordination, and the laying on of the Hands of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> then &s;urely we mu&s;t Condemn all tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ed Witne&s;&s;es which God rai&s;ed up in the time of <HI>Popery,</HI> to te&s;tify a|gain&s;t the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> becau&s;e they did not prove their Authority by Miracles; nor was there any to ordain them, but their cruel Per&s;e|cutors under whom they &s;uffered Martyrdoms.</P>
<P>Yet did God &s;o open their under&s;tanding to under&s;tand the Scripture, and give them a Mouth and Wi&s;dom, that all their Adver&s;aries were not able to gain&s;ay; which was a &s;uffici|ent Te&s;timony to prove their Authority, and that they were the true Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> By the &s;ame Rule we mu&s;t al&s;o con|demn <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> and judge him to be a Deceiver; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> for that he did not prove his Authority by Miracles, as the Scripture plain|ly tells us, <HI>John</HI> 10.41. <HI>And many re&s;orted to him,</HI> (that is Chri&s;t) <HI>and &s;aid</HI> John <HI>did no mira|cles,</HI> &amp;c. Thus it appears by the Te&s;timony of tho&s;e who were the Followers of Chri&s;t, that <HI>John</HI> did no Miracle.</P>
<P>And <HI>2dly.</HI> That he was not Ordained by the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> is clear from <HI>Mark</HI> 1.1. <HI>The beginning of the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. Ver. 3, 4. <HI>The voice of one crying in the Wilderne&s;s, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths &s;traight.</HI> John <HI>did Bapti&s;e in the Wilderne&s;s, and preach the Bapti&s;m of Repentance, for the remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="002809_0094_0FE5F85A6D2D8188">
Thus it appears, that <HI>John</HI>'s Mini&s;try was the Beginning of the Go&s;pel of Ju&s;us Chri&s;t; and therefore no Per&s;on was capable to Or|dain him to his Office: Otherwi&s;e they that did Ordain him, mu&s;t have been in the Work before him, and he could not have been the beginner of it.</P>
<P>And thus if we take <HI>P. P</HI>'s. Rule, we mu&s;t number <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> in with the&s;e few which he &s;ays are &s;uch as <HI>George Fox</HI> and <HI>John Rogers,</HI> becau&s;e they have not proved their Authority by Miracles, nor the impo&s;ition of Hands, and &s;o con&s;equently we are to doubt of his Doc|trine, which is the beginning of the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and on which the whole New-Te&s;tament is built: And for as much as the Old-Te&s;tament is fulfilled in the New, this Here&s;y now broached by <HI>P. P.</HI> tends to the overthrow of both Old and New Te&s;tament, and &s;o con&s;equently to reduce the World into Pagani&s;m.</P>
<P>In Page 67. he goes on as follows. Once more be per&s;waded to make a few &s;hort but rea&s;onable Reflections on &s;ome part of his Life, and &s;ee if you can therein di&s;cover the Characters and Signs of a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t: Particularly the matter about <HI>Mary Ransford.</HI> And methinks Rea&s;on &s;hould guide you thus in your Thoughts, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Fir&s;t, That &s;he was either his lawful Wife, or not; if not, then his Whore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="002809_0095_0FE5F85C19375668">
Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> If &s;he were his lawful Wife, then his putting her away was without &s;ufficient Grounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And con&s;equently he broke Wedlock, and committed Adultery in &s;o doing. If you Re|ply, that <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> did as bad, I'll grant it; but I ob&s;erve, that they both repented of, confe&s;&s;ed and for&s;ook their Sins; but he always ju&s;tified his, and lived in it to the Day of his Death, that is his Adultery. If &s;he were his Wife, as I think you will judge &s;he was, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> As to his quaerying whether &s;he were his Wife or his Whore, I take to be another of his <HI>I&s;hmaeliti&s;h</HI> Arrows &s;hot at his imagined Ene|my, for he has already confe&s;&s;ed in page 58th. that the two Children he had by her were after he had &s;olemnly betrothed her to him, and now again he &s;ays if &s;he were his Wife, as I think you will judge &s;he was.</P>
<P>Here again he makes no doubt but every one will judge her to be his Wife; &s;o that there is no Argument between us concerning that point, &s;ince we both allow her to be his lawful Wife.</P>
<P>And as to what he &s;ays concerning his put|ing her away, I have already given an account how &s;he was terrified by the Court, to deny and for&s;ake her Husband, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He al&s;o a&s;&s;erts, That he lived in his Adultery to the day of his Death, by which it is mani|fe&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="002809_0096_0FE5F85E9115AC28">that he forgets what he &s;aid in Page 59th. (<HI>viz.</HI>) That after this woman had left him, he was lawfully married to a Woman of <HI>Oy&s;terbay, &amp;c.</HI> which if he had not forgot him&s;elf, he could not have been &s;o ignorant, but that he mu&s;t have known that while a Man lived in Adultery, he could not be lawfully married to another Woman.</P>
<P>In Page 68th. he concludes with this follow|ing Exhortation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <Q>Finally, Pray &amp; &s;trive again&s;t this one Evil in &s;pecial, which other|wi&s;e will greatly retard your progre&s;s from Darkne&s;s to Light, and that is the &s;lavi&s;h Fear of being made the <HI>Scorn of Fools,</HI> and <HI>Song of the Drunkards,</HI> who will probably at every turn upbraid you of Uncon&s;tancy, twit you and yours of your <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> and the like; this &s;ort of Suffering is an evil Di&s;ea&s;e; it's what <HI>Da|vid</HI> earne&s;tly deprecated after his Fall.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> Here he greatly abu&s;es and wre&s;ts the holy Scriptures, through his own Ignorance and gro&s;s Darkne&s;s: For <HI>David</HI> was &s;o far from being uncon&s;tant in matters of Religion, or giving his Adver&s;aries occa&s;ion to twit him on that account, that the Scriptures te&s;tify that he was a Man after God's own Heart, &s;ave only in the matter of <HI>Uriah;</HI> and throughout the whole Scripture is he mentioned as a Pattern of all &s;uch as was mo&s;t con&s;tant and unmovable in matters of Religion; And as to what <HI>David</HI> laments in the 69th P&s;alm 12th Ver&s;e, how that he was the <HI>Song of the Drunkards,</HI> was not after
<PB N="84" REF="002809_0097_0FE5F860F4E1D780">his Fall, as <HI>P. P.</HI> ignorantly affects: For before his Fall, and always after to the Day of his Death, he was the mo&s;t honourable King upon the Earth; being honoured not only by God and his Church, but by all the great Nations in the World, who were mo&s;t of them his Servants and Tributaries, and therefore was far enough from being the Scorn of Fools and Song of the Drun|kards. But the time that he was the Song of the Drunkards, was when <HI>Saul</HI> with his drunken Army were hunting him like a <HI>Partridge in the Mountains,</HI> and drove him out of all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> into other Kingdoms, which he al&s;o la|ments in the &s;ame P&s;alm at the 8th. ver&s;e, in the&s;e Words, <HI>I am become a &s;tranger to my Brethren, and an aliant to my Mothers Children.</HI> Now we know that he was no &s;tranger to his Brethren af|ter his Fall, but was their King, and dwelt a|mong them. By which it is manife&s;t, that the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>David</HI> had only reference to the time of his exile by <HI>Saul,</HI> and not after his fall as <HI>P. P.</HI> has ignorantly a&s;&s;erted; yet that this evil Di&s;ea&s;e which he &s;eems to groan under, has been very grievous to him, I doubt not, (<HI>viz.</HI>) being twitted with his uncon&s;tancy in Religion, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>But how he thinks to get rid of his evil di&s;|ea&s;e I know not, &s;ince he &s;o much &s;lighted his Religion when he had it, as to &s;wap and change it about till he had none left; and for him to think to help his evil Di&s;ea&s;e by comparing him|&s;elf to the Prophet <HI>David,</HI> who&s;e Life and Con|ver&s;ation was of &s;uch an infinite <HI>Longitude</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">de of the Life and Conver&s;ation of <HI>P. P.</HI> that the
<PB N="85" REF="002809_0098_0FE5F864F7ED71A0">very compari&s;on tends more to &s;tir up the &s;tink of his evil Di&s;ea&s;e, than any ways to abate it.</P>
<P>And now having gone through his Book, I &s;hall look back and briefly mind the Reader of &s;ome Remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages therein contained, which may be worthy of Ob&s;ervation. Fir&s;t, as to his Adverti&s;ement, he tells us, it was fini&s;h|ed by the be&s;t advice &s;ince <HI>John Rogers</HI>'s Death.</P>
<P>Now compare this with what he &s;ays in his &s;eventh page, where he tells us, that when he began to fear that he had been in the way of an erroneous and Heterodox Religion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that with all po&s;&s;ible earne&s;tne&s;s, he asked Coun&s;el of the Wonderful Coun&s;ellor, and Wi&s;dom of him that gives it liberally to all, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From which I ob&s;erve, that the Spirit which he was acted by in the time of his vi&s;itation, (which he calls his being led into <HI>Quakeri&s;m</HI>) led him in times of difficulties to ask Advice and Coun|&s;el of God, who is the Wonderful Coun&s;ellor, and he that gives Wi&s;dom to all, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince his Apo&s;ta&s;y, he calls that the be&s;t Advice which advi&s;es him to deride and bely a Man in his Grave; which Advice mu&s;t needs be given him either by the Father of Lies, or &s;ome of his Children, which is another manife&s;t Proof of his Apo&s;ta&s;y.</P>
<P>Another thing which I &s;hall take notice of, is in page 54 where he a&s;&s;erts, that the Divorc|ing
<PB N="86" REF="002809_0099_0FE5F868F44F0D60"><HI>J. R</HI>'s. Wife from him, was his Adultery and Bea&s;tiality.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, Here he greatly reflects upon the Authority of the Government, for if <HI>J. R.</HI> was guilty of Bea&s;tiality, then the Autho|rity was highly guilty of inju&s;tice in a two fold manner.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> Becau&s;e they did not execute that Puni&s;h|ment on him which both the Law of God and their own Law required them to have done, which is Death.</P>
<P N="2">And <HI>2dly.</HI> It was great inju&s;tice to take away his Wife on that account, becau&s;e there is no Law of God nor this Colony that allows of &s;uch a Sentence.</P>
<P N="3">And <HI>3dly.</HI> They were highly guilty of Per|jury, in not acting according to the Law of God and this Colony, which they were bound by their &s;olemn Oath to have done.</P>
<P>And thus <HI>P. P.</HI> by belying <HI>J. R.</HI> has greatly expo&s;ed the Authority of the Government.</P>
<P>Again in page 60. and 61. he informs the Reader, how the Authority Puni&s;hed <HI>John Ro|gers</HI> and his &s;econd Wife on account of their two Children, and yet in page 58. confe&s;&s;es that <HI>J. R.</HI> had both the Children by her after he had &s;olemnly betrothed her to him.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="002809_0100_0FE5F869CB5031C8">
So that in &s;hort <HI>P. P.</HI> charges the Authority with Puni&s;hing <HI>J. R.</HI> for having Children by his Wife, and acquitting him for Bea&s;tiality.</P>
<P>And now to conclude, under the con&s;iderati|on of <HI>John Rogers</HI>'s great Sufferings, which be|gan &s;oon after his Conver&s;ion, and continued all his Life after which was near fifty years, and that now after his Death the Adver&s;ary having &s;tirred up <HI>P. P.</HI> to pur&s;ue him in his Grave with Mocks, Scoffs and abominable Lies, and yet throughout his whole Book, is not able to prove him guilty of any one Mi&s;demeanour in the whole cour&s;e of his Life, which is a &s;ufficient Argument that he is one of tho&s;e which Chri&s;t &s;peaks of, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.11, 12. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye when men &s;hall revile you, and per&s;ecute you, and &s;hall &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t you fal&s;ly for my &s;ake: Re|joyce and be exceeding glad, for great u your Re|ward in Heaven: for &s;o per&s;ecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</HI></P>
