<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is a pathetic, elegant, and &s;ententious &s;implicity in the writings of great and good men, &s;ingularly expre&s;&s;ive of that &s;weetne&s;s, har|mony, and uniformity of conduct which accom|panied them through life, and which I take to be the natural re&s;ult of con&s;cious goodne&s;s and exal|ted virtue. The peru&s;al of &s;uch writings affords more plea&s;ure than the pompous di&s;play of rheto|rical flouri&s;hes and refined elaborate periods: I was therefore highly delighted with a letter which a neighbour of mine, a quaker, has com|municated to me, wrote by Mr. <HI>Penn,</HI> to his wife and children a little before his fir&s;t voyage to <HI>America,</HI> and found after his death among &s;ome old manu&s;cripts never publi&s;hed. I have gained permi&s;&s;ion to copy it, and here &s;end it you. The &s;entiments are not &s;tudied, novel, or &s;ublime, but &s;imple, &s;incere and natural, adapted to the occa|&s;ion, flowing from the heart, and con&s;onant with the rules of true epi&s;tolary writing. Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> (as ob&s;erved of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>) appears not &s;o
<PB N="3" REF="044758_0003_101F02268F0006E0">properly to &s;peak from nature, as that &s;he &s;peaks through him. Whether we view this great man in the light of a legi&s;lator, hi&s;torian, or chronolo|gi&s;t, we mu&s;t allow he had great extent of know|ledge, accuracy of judgment, and quickne&s;s of invention; and I think it is but ju&s;tice to his me|mory to ob&s;erve, that in all his writings the gen|tleman, &s;cholar and chri&s;tian are eminently con|&s;picuous. He appears to have had a much deeper and truer &s;en&s;e of religion than was common to the genius of the times in which he lived.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear wife and children:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY love, that &s;ea, nor land, nor death it&s;elf can extingui&s;h or le&s;&s;en towards you, mo&s;t endearedly vi&s;its you with eternal embraces, and will abide with you for ever: And may the God of my life watch over you, and ble&s;s you, and do you good in this world and for ever. Some things are upon my &s;pirit to leave with you in your re&s;pective capacities, as I am to one a hu&s;band, and to the re&s;t a father, if I &s;hould never &s;ee you more in this world.</P>
<P>My dear wife, remember thou wa&s;t the love of my youth, and much the joy of my life, the
<PB N="4" REF="044758_0004_101F0228164D6D48">mo&s;t beloved as well as mo&s;t worthy of all my earthly comforts, and the rea&s;on of that love was more thy inward than thy outward excellencies (which yet were many.) God knows, and thou knowe&s;t it, I can &s;ay it was a match of provi|dence's making, and God's image in us both was the fir&s;t thing, and the mo&s;t amiable and enga|ging ornament in our eyes. Now I am to leave thee, and that without knowing whether I &s;hall ever &s;ee thee more in this world; take my coun&s;el into thy bo&s;om, and let it dwell with thee in my &s;tead while thou live&s;t.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Let the fear of the Lord, and a zeal and love to his glory dwell richly in thy heart, and thou wilt watch for good over thy&s;elf and thy dear children and family, that no rude light or bad thing be committed; el&s;e God will be offen|ded, and he will repent him&s;elf of the good he intends thee and thine.</P>
<P>Secondly. Be diligent in meetings for wor&s;hip and bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;tir up thy&s;elf and others herein, it is thy day and place: And let meetings be kept once a day in the family, to wait upon the Lord, who has given us much time for our&s;elves. And, my deare&s;t, to make thy family matters ea&s;y to thee, divide thy time and be regular, it is ea&s;y and &s;weet; thy retirement will afford thee to do it, as in the morning to view the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e, and fix it as thou de&s;ire&s;t, &s;eeing all be in order, that by thy coun&s;el all may move, and to
<PB N="5" REF="044758_0005_101F022AA1B42C80">thee render an account every evening. The time for work, for walking, for meals, may be certain, at lea&s;t let them be made &s;o as near as may be; and grieve not thy&s;elf with carele&s;s &s;ervants, they will di&s;order thee; rather pay them and let them go, if they will not be better by admonitions: This is be&s;t, to avoid many words, which I know wound the &s;oul, and offend the Lord.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Ca&s;t up thy income, and &s;ee what it daily amounts to, by which thou maye&s;t be &s;ure to have it in thy &s;ight and power to keep within compa&s;s; and I be&s;eech thee to live low and &s;paringly till my debts are paid, and then enlarge as thou &s;ee&s;t it convenient: Remember thy mo|ther's example when thy father's public &s;pirited|ne&s;s had wor&s;ted his e&s;tate (which is my ca&s;e.) I know thou love&s;t plain things, and art aver&s;e to the pomps of the world, a nobility natural to thee. I write not as doubtful, but to quicken thee for my &s;ake to be more vigilant herein, knowing that God will ble&s;s thy ca&s;e, and thy poor children and thee for it: My mind is wrapt up in a &s;aying of thy father's, I de&s;ire not riches, but to owe nothing; and truly that is wealth, and more than enough to live is a &s;nare attended with many &s;or|rows. I need not bid thee be humble, for thou art &s;o, nor meek and patient, for it is much of thy natural di&s;po&s;ition; but I pray thee be oft in re|tirement with the Lord, and guard again&s;t en|croaching friend&s;hips; keep them at arm's end, for it is giving away our power, ay, and &s;elf too,
<PB N="6" REF="044758_0006_101F022E683BD9B8">into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another, and that which might &s;eem engaging in the beginning may prove a yoke and burden too hard and heavy in the end. Wherefore keep dominion over thy&s;elf, and let thy children, good meetings, and friends be the plea&s;ure of thy life.</P>
<P>Fourthly. And now, my deare&s;t, let me re|commend to thy care my dear children, abun|dantly beloved of me as the Lord's ble&s;&s;ings, and the &s;weet pledges of our mutual and endeared affection. Above all things endeavour to breed them up in the love of virtue, and that holy plain way of it which we have lived in, that the world in no part of it get into my family. I had rather they were homely than finely bred, as to outward behaviour; yet I love &s;weetne&s;s mixed with gra|vity, and chearfulne&s;s tempered with &s;obriety: Religion in the heart leads into this true civlity, teaching men and women to be mild and courteous in their behaviour, an accompli&s;hment worthy indeed of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Fifthly. Next breed them up in the love one of another; tell them it is the charge I left behind me, and that it is the way to have the love and ble&s;&s;ing of God upon them, al&s;o what his portion is who hates or calls his brother fool. Sometimes &s;eparate them, but not long, and allow them to &s;end and give each other &s;mall things to endear one another with; once more, I &s;ay, tell them it was my coun&s;el they &s;hould be tender and affec|tionate
<PB N="7" REF="044758_0007_101F022FF4D3F4D0">one to another. For their learning be liberal; &s;pare no co&s;t, for by &s;uch par&s;imony all is lo&s;t that is &s;aved; but let it be u&s;eful know|ledge, &s;uch as is con&s;i&s;tent with truth and godli|ne&s;s, not cheri&s;hing a vain conver&s;ation or idle mind; but ingenuity mixed with indu&s;try is good for the body and mind too: I recommend the u&s;eful parts of mathematics, as building hou&s;es or &s;hips, mea&s;uring, &s;urveying, dialing, navigation, &amp;c. but agriculture is e&s;pecially in my eye; let my children be hu&s;bandmen and hou&s;ewives, it is indu&s;trious, healthy, hone&s;t, and of good ex|ample; like <HI>Abraham</HI> and the holy ancients, who plea&s;ed God, and obtained a good report, this leads to con&s;ider the works of God and na|ture of things that are good, and diverts the mind from being taken up with the vain arts and in|ventions of a luxurious world. It is commen|dable in the princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the nobles of that empire, that they have all their children in&s;tructed in &s;ome u&s;eful occupation. Rather keep an ingenious per&s;on in the hou&s;e to teach them than &s;end them to &s;chools, too many evil impre&s;&s;ions being commonly received there: Be|&s;ure to ob&s;erve their genius, and do not cro&s;s it as to learning: Let them not dwell too long on one thing; but let their change be agreeable and all their diver&s;ions have &s;ome bodily labour in them. When grown big have mo&s;t care for them, for then there are more &s;nares both within and without. When marriageable &s;ee that they
<PB N="8" REF="044758_0008_101F02329F8F8F30">have worthy per&s;ons in their eye, of good life and good fame for piety and under&s;tanding: I need no wealth but &s;ufficiency; and be&s;ure their love be dear, fervent, and mutual, that it may be happy for them: I chu&s;e not they &s;hould be mar|ried to earthly covetous kindred, and of cities and towns of concour&s;e beware: The world is apt to &s;tick clo&s;e to tho&s;e who have lived and got wealth there: A country life and e&s;tate I like be&s;t for my children: I prefer a decent man&s;ion of an hundred pounds <HI>per annum</HI> before ten thou&s;and pounds in <HI>London</HI> or &s;uch like place in a way of trade. In fine, my dear, endeavour to breed them dutiful to the Lord, and his ble&s;&s;ed light, truth and grace in their hearts, who is their Creator, and his fear will grow up with them. "Teach a child (&s;ays the wi&s;e man) the way thou wilt have him to walk, and when he is old he will not forget it." Next, obedience to thee, their dear mother, and that not for wrath but for con&s;cience &s;ake: Liberal to the poor, pitiful to the mi&s;erable, humble and kind to all: And may my God make thee a ble&s;&s;ing, and give thee comfort in our dear children, and in age gather thee to the joy and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the ju&s;t (where no death &s;hall &s;eparate us) for ever.</P>
<P>And now, my dear children, that are the gifts and mercies of the God of your tender father, hear my coun&s;el, and lay it up in your hearts; love it more than trea&s;ure, and follow it, and you
<PB N="9" REF="044758_0009_101F023586C379D0">&s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed here and happy hereafter. In the fir&s;t place, remember your Creator in the days of your youth; it was the glory of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the &s;econd of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> and how did God ble&s;s <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> becau&s;e he feared him in his youth! And &s;o he did <HI>Jacob, Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> O! my dear children, remember, and fear, and &s;erve him who made you, and gave you to me and your dear mother, that you may live to him and glorify him in your generation. To do this, in your youthful days &s;eek after the Lord, that you may find him, remembering his great love in creating you, that you are not bea&s;ts, plants or &s;tones; but that he has kept you, and given you his grace within, and &s;ub&s;tance without, and provided plentifully for you. This remember in your youth, that you may be kept from the evil of the world, for in age it will be harder to over|come the temptations of it. Wherefore, my dear children, e&s;chew the appearance of evil, and love and cleave to that in your hearts that &s;hews you evil from good, and tells you when you do ami&s;s, and reproves you for it. It is the light of Chri&s;t, that he has given you for your &s;alvation. If you do this, and follow my coun&s;el, God will ble&s;s you in this world, and give you an inheri|tance in that which &s;hall never have an end; for the light of Je&s;us is of a purifying nature, it &s;ea&s;ons tho&s;e who love it and take heed to it, and never leaves &s;uch till it has brought them to the city of God that has foundations. O! that ye may be
<PB N="10" REF="044758_0010_101F0239B026B0D0">&s;ea&s;oned with the gracious nature of it: Hide it in your hearts, and flee, my dear children, from all youthful lu&s;ts, the vain &s;ports, pa&s;times and plea&s;ures of the world; redeeming the time, be|cau&s;e the days are evil. You are now beginning to live. What would &s;ome give for your time? Oh! I could have lived better were I as you in the flower of youth. Therefore love and fear the Lord, keep clo&s;e to meetings, and delight to wait on the Lord God of your father and mother among his de&s;pi&s;ed people, as we have done; and count it your honour to be members of that &s;o|ciety, and heirs of that living fellow&s;hip which is enjoyed among them, for the experience of which your father's &s;oul ble&s;&s;eth the Lord for ever.</P>
<P>Next, be obedient to your dear mother, a wo|man who&s;e virtue and good name is an honour to you, for &s;he hath been exceeded by none in her time for her plainne&s;s, integrity, indu&s;try, hu|manity, virtue and good under&s;tanding, qualities not u&s;ual among women of her worldly condition and quality: Therefore honour and obey her, my dear children, as your mother and your fa|ther's love and delight; nay, love her too, for &s;he loved your father with a deep and upright love, chu&s;ing him before all her many &s;uitors; and though &s;he be of a delicate con&s;titution and noble &s;pirit, yet &s;he de&s;cended to the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s and care for you, performing the painfulle&s;t acts of &s;ervice to you in your infancy as a mother and a nur&s;e too. I charge you before the Lord,
<PB N="11" REF="044758_0011_101F023C4FF4DE90">honour and obey, love and cheri&s;h your dear mother.</P>
<P>Next, betake your&s;elves to &s;ome hone&s;t indu&s;|trious cour&s;e of life, and that not of &s;ordid cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, but for example, and to avoid idlene&s;s. And if you change your condition and marry, chu&s;e with the knowledge and con&s;ent of your mother if living, guardians or tho&s;e that have the charge of you: Mind neither beauty nor riches, but the fear of the Lord, and a &s;weet and amiable di&s;po&s;ition, &s;uch as you can love above all this world, and that may make your habitations plea&s;ant and de&s;irable to you; and being married, be tender, affectionate, patient and meek: Live in the fear of the Lord, and he will ble&s;s you and your offspring. Be &s;ure to live within compa&s;s; borrow not, neither be beholden to any: Ruin not your&s;elves by kindne&s;s to others, for that exceeds the due bounds of friend&s;hip, neither will a true friend expect it: Small matters I heed not: Let your indu&s;try and par&s;imony go no further than for a &s;ufficiency for life, and to make a pro|vi&s;ion for your children (and that in moderation) if the Lord gives you any. I charge you, help the poor and needy. Let the Lord have a volun|tary &s;hare of your income for the good of the poor both in our &s;ociety and others; for we are all his creatures; remembering, that he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord. Know well your incomings, and your outgoings may be better regulated. Love not money nor the world;
<PB N="12" REF="044758_0012_101F023DDE3DBAD0">u&s;e them only, and they will &s;erve you; but if you love them you &s;erve them; which will deba&s;e your &s;pirits, as well as offend the Lord. Pity the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, and hold out a hand of help to them; it may be your ca&s;e; and as you mete to others God will mete to you again. Be humble and gentle in your conver&s;ation, of few words I charge you, but always pertinent when you &s;peak; hear|ing out before you attempt to an&s;wer, and then &s;peaking as if you would per&s;uade not impo&s;e. Affront none, neither revenge the affronts that are done to you, but forgive and you &s;hall be forgiven of your heavenly Father. In making friends con&s;ider well fir&s;t; and when you are fixed be true, not wavering by reports nor de|&s;erting in afflictions, for that becomes not the good and virtuous. Watch again&s;t anger, neither &s;peak nor act in it, for like drunkenne&s;s it makes a man a bea&s;t, and throws people into de&s;perate inconveniences. Avoid flatterers, for they are thieves in di&s;gui&s;e, their prai&s;e is co&s;tly, de&s;igning to get by tho&s;e they be&s;peak; they are the wor&s;t of creatures, they lie to flatter, and flatter to cheat; and which is wor&s;e, if you believe them, you cheat your&s;elves mo&s;t dangerou&s;ly; but the vir|tuous, though poor, love, cheri&s;h and prefer. Remember <HI>David,</HI> who a&s;king the Lord, Who &s;hall abide in thy tabernacle? Who &s;hall dwell in thy holy hill? an&s;wers, He that walketh up|rightly, worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;peaketh the truth in his heart, in who&s;e eyes the vile per&s;on is contemned, but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="044758_0013_101F02408B5D3DA0">
Next, my dear children, be temperate in all things; in your diet, for that is phy&s;ic by preven|tion, it keeps, nay it makes people healthy and their generation &s;ound: This is exclu&s;ive of the &s;piritual advantage it brings. Be al&s;o plain in your apparel; keep out that lu&s;t which reigns too much over &s;ome; let your virtues be your orna|ments, remembering, life is more than meat, and the body than raiment. Let your furniture be &s;imple and cheap; avoid pride, avarice and luxury. Read my No CROSS NO CROWN: There is in&s;truction. Make your conver&s;ation with the mo&s;t eminent for wi&s;dom and piety, and &s;hun all wicked men, as you hope for the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and the comfort of your father's living and dying prayers. Be &s;ure you &s;peak no evil of any, no not of the meane&s;t, much le&s;s of your &s;uperiors, as magi&s;trates, guardians, tutors, teach|ers, and elders in Chri&s;t. Be no bu&s;y bodies, meddle not with other folk's matters but when in con&s;cience and duty pre&s;t, for it procures trouble, and is ill manners, and very un&s;eemly to wi&s;e men. In your families remember <HI>Abraham, Mo&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> their integrity to the Lord, and do as you have them for your examples. Let the fear and &s;ervice of the living God be en|couraged in your hou&s;es, and that plainne&s;s, &s;o|briety and moderation in all things, as becometh God's cho&s;en people. And as I advi&s;e you, my beloved children, do you coun&s;el yours, if God &s;hould give you any; Yea I coun&s;el and com|mand
<PB N="14" REF="044758_0014_101F0244589FF868">them, as my po&s;terity, that they love and &s;erve the Lord God with an upright heart, that he may ble&s;s you and yours from generation to generation. And as for you who are likely to be concerned in the government of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and my parts of <HI>Ea&s;t Jer&s;ey,</HI> (e&s;pecially the fir&s;t) I do charge you before the Lord God and his holy angels, that you be lowly, dillgent, and ten|der, fearing God, loving the people, and hating covetou&s;ne&s;s. Let ju&s;tice have its impartial cour&s;e, and the law free pa&s;&s;age; though to your lo&s;s protect no man again&s;t it, for you are not above the law, but the law above you. Live therefore the lives your&s;elves you would have the people live, and then you have right and boldne&s;s to puni&s;h the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. Keep upon the &s;quare, for God &s;ees you. Therefore do your duty; and be &s;ure you &s;ee with your own eyes, and hear with your own ears. Entertain no lurchers, cheri&s;h no informers for gain or re|venge. U&s;e no tricks, fly to no devices to &s;up|port or cover inju&s;tice; but let your hearts be upright before the Lord, tru&s;ting in him above the contrivances of men, and none &s;hall be able to hurt or &s;upplant. Oh! the Lord is a &s;trong God, and he can do what&s;oever he plea&s;es; and though men con&s;ider it not, it is the Lord that rules and overrules in the kingdoms of men, and he builds up and pulls down. I your father am the man that can &s;ay, He that tru&s;ts in the Lord &s;hall not be confounded, but God in due time
<PB N="15" REF="044758_0015_101F0246E32EE988">will make his enemies be at peace with him. If you thus behave your&s;elves, and &s;o become a terror to evil doers and a prai&s;e to them that do well, God, my God will be with you in wi&s;dom and a &s;ound mind, and make you ble&s;&s;ed in&s;tru|ments in his hand for the &s;ettlement of &s;ome of tho&s;e de&s;olate parts of the world, which my &s;oul de&s;ires above all worldly honours and riches, both for you that go and you that &s;tay, you that govern and you that are governed, that in the end you may be gathered with me to the re&s;t of God.</P>
<P>Finally, my dear children, love one another with a true endeared love, and your dear relations on both &s;ides; and take care to pre&s;erve a tender affection in your children to each other, often marrying within them&s;elves, &s;o as it be without the bounds forbidden in God's law; that &s;o they may not (like the forgetting and unnatural world) grow out of kindred and as cold as &s;trangers, but, as becomes a truly natural and chri&s;tian &s;tock, you and yours after you may live in the pure and fervent love of God towards one another, as be|cometh brethren in the &s;piritual and natural re|lation: So, my God, that has ble&s;&s;ed me with his abundant mercies both of this and the other and better life, be with you all, guide you by his coun&s;el, ble&s;s you, and bring you to his eternal glory; that you may &s;hine, my dear children, in the firmament of God's power, with the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits of the ju&s;t, that cele&s;tial family, prai&s;ing
<PB N="16" REF="044758_0016_101F02486F623FC0">and admiring him the God and Father of it for ever and ever. For there is no God like unto him, the God of <HI>Abraham,</HI> of <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and of <HI>Jacob,</HI> the God of the prophets, the apo&s;tles, and mar|tyrs of Je&s;us, in whom I live for ever. So, fare|well to my thrice dearly beloved wife and chil|dren. Yours, as God plea&s;eth, in that which no waters can quench, no time forget, nor di&s;tance wear away, but remains for ever.</P>
