<HEAD>To the READER,</HEAD>
<P>THERE needs no Apology for the Publication of the following Sermons; the va&s;t Importance of the Subject, renders a Di&s;|cour&s;e of this Kind always &s;ea&s;onable; tho' perhaps it may be thought by &s;ome, that no Apology can be &s;ufficient, for the en&s;uing Remarks upon an Author of &s;o great Name and Character, as Dr. <HI>Waterland.</HI> But as I have endeavoured to approve my&s;elf unto God, in that Undertaking; I can patiently bear any of tho&s;e Invectives that may be expected, from the Gentlemen of contrary Sentiments.&mdash;I am as fully per&s;uaded, that the Cau&s;e I am de|fending is the Cau&s;e of God, as I am that the Scriptures are the Word of God. If I believe the one, I mu&s;t believe the other, if it be po&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand the Meaning of the mo&s;t plain, familiar, and expre&s;s Words that can be &s;poken,&mdash;The Souls of Men are therefore nearly concern'd in this Matter; and the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel loudly called upon, vigorou&s;ly to exert them&s;elves, that they may prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, the Defection that is already begun in &s;everal Parts of the Land, upon Account of this great Article of Chri&s;tianity. If this be not a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for this Undertak|ing, I have none to give.</P>
<P>I don't intend by the&s;e Remarks, merely a Refutation of Dr. <HI>Waterland's</HI> Book, but of his Principles, al&s;o by whom&s;oever e&s;|pou&s;ed. I have therefore been larger upon &s;ome Points, than would have been nece&s;&s;ary in An&s;wer to that Di&s;cour&s;e; and either wholly pa&s;&s;ed over, or but briefly touched upon, &s;ome other very erroneous Principles, that do not &s;o immediately enter into the Merits of the Cau&s;e.&mdash;What I aim at, is, to furni&s;h the Reader with Armour from the Word of God, not only again&s;t the dangerous Doctrines contain'd in that Di&s;cour&s;e; but al&s;o again&s;t any other
<PB N="iv" REF="005163_0003_1016CB1A201E2718">
Attack of the like Kind, from any other Quarter. And I hope he may be &s;ufficiently &s;ecured, by duly attending to what is &s;aid, in the following Sermon and Remarks.</P>
<P>I have thought my&s;elf called, to make the&s;e Animadver&s;ions upon Dr. <HI>Waterland's</HI> Di&s;cour&s;e in particular, partly becau&s;e it is indu&s;triou&s;ly handed about in &s;everal Parts of the Country, to make Pro&s;elites; and partly becau&s;e the Subject is the mo&s;t conci&s;ely and plau&s;ibly handled in that Di&s;cour&s;e, of any that I have met with.</P>
<P>I expect to be cen&s;ured, for expre&s;&s;ing &s;o much Confidence and A&s;&s;urance in the Ca&s;e before us, in Oppo&s;ition to Men of &s;o great Name, on the other Side of the Que&s;tion; as if I was arrogating Infallibility to my&s;elf: But I have this to &s;ay in my Defence, Tho' I am far from &s;uppo&s;ing my&s;elf infallible; yet I don't think it a ju&s;t Rea&s;on to run into Scepti&s;ci&s;m; and to doubt of the Cer|tainty of &s;ome of the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t important Truths in the Word of God; becau&s;e I am fallible and liable to mi&s;take.&mdash;I am not willing to make a Compliment of &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential Article of prac|tical Godline&s;s, upon which our Eternity immediately depends, to any Per&s;ons of what Name or Character &s;oever; or to appear wavering or uncertain about it, that I may avoid this Cen&s;ure; and be&s;peak the Character of a mode&s;t Writer.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I mu&s;t either entertain this Confidence and A&s;&s;urance, or &s;uppo&s;e at lea&s;t a Po&s;&s;ibility of Truth, in &s;ome of the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdities in the World.&mdash;I mu&s;t either be confident that I am right, or el&s;e &s;uppo&s;e a Po&s;&s;ibility.&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That all the Texts of Scripture which I have cited, both from the old and new Te&s;tament, with others of the like Kind, which &s;peak of being &s;prinkled, wa&s;hed, or clean&s;ed with Water, do all immediately refer to Water Bapti&s;m; or el&s;e,&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e Words in <HI>Joh.</HI> iii. 5; and <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 5. mu&s;t be under&s;tood of Water Bapti&s;m; tho' no other Scriptures exactly parallel to them are &s;o to be under&s;tood; and tho' I can't imagine any Rea&s;on from the Words them&s;elves; or from the Nature of Things, why it &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible, that every baptized Per&s;on, has all the Properties and Characters a&s;cribed to the New Birth, in Scriptures, or el&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="v" REF="005163_0004_1016CB1BAF24E0D0">4.

This I think is plainly taught by Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI> (p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.) And this if I mi&s;take not, is plainly to teach, that a Man may be rege|nerate and not regenerate at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e; or el&s;e</P>
<P N="5">5. I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that the Scriptures &s;peak of two different Kinds of Regeneration, as Qualifications for the Kingdom of God; the one bapti&s;mal, which may be without Holine&s;s; the other a Change of Heart, nece&s;&s;arily productive of a holy Life. That is in other Words, that Holine&s;s of Heart and Life is the nece&s;&s;ary Fruit of Regeneration; and yet is not nece&s;&s;arily found in all that are truly Regenerate.</P>
<P>The&s;e and other &s;uch like Ab&s;urdities, mention'd in the following Di&s;cour&s;e, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e; or el&s;e I mu&s;t retain my Confidence, that I am not liable to mi&s;take in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.&mdash;There is no other Choice before me.&mdash;I have therefore cho&s;en the &s;afe&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Side of the Que&s;tion, which I hope through the Grace of God to &s;tand to; and according to my poor Ability to defend, as long as I can hold a Pen in my Hand.</P>
<P>The Subject has naturally led me to u&s;e the &s;ame Manner of Rea&s;oning, more than once, upon different Occa&s;ions, in the en&s;uing Remarks; and I had rather be cen&s;ured for u&s;ing needle&s;s Repe|tition; than to fail of giving my Reader Conviction, of the dread|ful Danger of the Doctrine which I oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have no Favour to a&s;k of the Reader, on Account of any Un|accuracies in the Manner of Performance, or the Stile.&mdash;If this Attempt be ble&s;&s;ed of God, to convince poor unregenerate Sinners, of the infinite Mi&s;chief that will follow a Mi&s;take in this great Concern; and to put them upon proper Solicitude, to lay &s;uch a Foundation of Hope; that they may finally enter into the Kingdom of God; my End is obtained.&mdash;And whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, I hope for Acceptance from Him, who&s;e Intere&s;t I have con&s;ulted; and endeavoured to promote.</P>

<HEAD>THE NATURE and NECESSITY OF REGENERATION.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOH. III. 3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid unto him, Verily, Verily I &s;ay unto thee, except a Man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THESE Words were occa&s;ion'd by a Vi&s;it made to our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, by <HI>Nicodemus</HI> a Ruler among the Jews, who being convinc'd by the miraculous Works which Chri&s;t had wrought, that he was divinely in&s;pired, was probably now enquiring of him the Way of Sal|vation. This An&s;wer &s;eems therefore to be given, to obviate all his fal&s;e Apprehen&s;ions and vain Hopes of Acceptance with God, by any outward Privileges or Performances; and to &s;hew him, that there mu&s;t be a great Change wrought in the Heart of every one, that would be a Partaker of the future Glory. Such a Change as is of the Nature of a <HI>new Creation;</HI> and may
<PB N="2" REF="005163_0006_1016CB2196626090">
be aptly compared to being <HI>born again.</HI> Our Lord a&s;&s;ures him by a repeated A&s;&s;everation, (thereby to awaken his mo&s;t &s;erious Attention) that this Change is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that without it, no Man &s;hall ever <HI>&s;ee the Kingdom of God.</HI>&mdash;This Doctrine was taught <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> not as a Concern peculiar to him&s;elf, but as what equally referred to all Men, without Di&s;tinc|tion. It therefore as much affects us as it did him, and is of the greate&s;t Importance to us all, &s;ince no le&s;s than our eternal Welfare depends upon it. Let us then con&s;ider</P>
<P N="1">1. What we are to under&s;tand by <HI>the Kingdom of God,</HI> which no unregenerate Man can ever &s;ee.</P>
<P N="2">2. What we are to under&s;tand by being <HI>born again,</HI> without which we cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whence this Change which our Saviour here &s;peaks of, is called a <HI>new Birth.</HI> And</P>
<P N="4">4. Whence it is &s;o, that the unregenerate <HI>can|not &s;ee the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. I am fir&s;t then to con&s;ider, what we are to under&s;tand by the Kingdom of God, which an unregenerate Man cannot &s;ee.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that there is a twofold Interpretation of the&s;e Words, <HI>(the Kingdom of God)</HI> according to the different Sen&s;e, in which they are el&s;ewhere u&s;ed in Scripture.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some under&s;tand them to &s;ignify <HI>the King|dom of Grace;</HI> or that &s;piritual Kingdom, which our Lord was erecting here in the World. In that Sen&s;e, we are to con&s;ider them as being of
<PB N="3" REF="005163_0007_1016CB234CA98BF0">
the &s;ame Tendency, as if our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had &s;aid to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> You come to me as to a <HI>Teacher &s;ent from God;</HI> and &s;eem willing to be|come one of my Di&s;ciples and Followers; and to be a Member of my &s;piritual Kingdom. But I a&s;&s;ure you this cannot be, while you remain in your pre&s;ent State. None can be acknow|ledged as real Members of that &s;piritual and heavenly Kingdom which God is now &s;etting up, who have not experienced &s;o great a Change of Heart, as may be aptly called a <HI>new Birth.</HI></P>
<P>The Words being thus under&s;tood, plainly &s;hew, that we cannot be Chri&s;tians indeed, we cannot be vital Members of Chri&s;t's my&s;tical Body; nor Partakers of the &s;aving Benefits of his Redemption, whil&s;t unregenerate. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. I chu&s;e to under&s;tand the Words of <HI>the Kingdom of Glory.</HI> And in that View, they are to be con&s;ider'd, as if our ble&s;&s;ed Lord had &s;aid to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> You &s;eem de&s;irous to know how you may &s;ecure a Title to the heavenly Glory; and it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary immediately to in|form you, that it is not your high Birth nor external Privileges, it is not your Conformity to the ceremonial Law; nor your acknowledging me to be a <HI>Teacher &s;ent from God,</HI> that will en|title you to that Glory and Happine&s;s: But I would have you receive it as a mo&s;t certain and important Truth, that no Man can ever be Par|taker of that glorious Inheritance, except he fir&s;t experience &s;o great a Change of Heart and Life, as will be like coming into a new World; and
<PB N="4" REF="005163_0008_1016CB2741E69668">
may be fitly compar'd to his being <HI>born again.</HI> In this Sen&s;e the following Scriptures are nece&s;|&s;arily to be under&s;tood. Mark ix. 47. <HI>It is better for thee to enter into the Kingdom of God with one Eye, than having two Eyes, to be ca&s;t into Hell Fire.</HI> Luk. xiii. 28. <HI>There &s;hall be Weeping and Gna&s;hing of Teeth, when ye &s;hall &s;ee</HI> Abraham, <HI>and</HI> I&s;aac, <HI>and</HI> Jacob <HI>in the Kingdom of God; and you your&s;elves thru&s;t out.</HI> So likewi&s;e ver&s;e 29.. with Acts xiv. 20. and many other Places.</P>
<P>This Interpretation of the&s;e Words appears mo&s;t agreeable, becau&s;e <HI>Nicodemus</HI> (how igno|rant &s;oever of the <HI>new Birth</HI>) &s;eems to have un|der&s;tood what our Lord meant by the <HI>Kingdom of God;</HI> and to be affected with the Danger of coming &s;hort of it. Whereas, if our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had &s;poken to him of his &s;piritual King|dom in this World, he could not have under|&s;tood him; but would have been at as great a Lo&s;s to have found out his Meaning in this, as in the other Part of his Di&s;cour&s;e. In this Sen&s;e therefore <HI>Nicodemus</HI> did under&s;tand the Words; and in this Sen&s;e, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord de&s;ign'd that he &s;hould under&s;tand 'em. For in the other Sen&s;e, he could have known Nothing at all of their Meaning. &mdash; Be&s;ides, it was probably his Concern for an Intere&s;t in <HI>the Kingdom of Glory,</HI> (and not of <HI>the Kingdom of Grace,</HI> which he knew &s;o little about) that prompted <HI>Nicodemus</HI> to this Conference with our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. To this Concern, if not to &s;ome previous Que&s;tion about the Way of Salvation, our Lord accommodates
<PB N="5" REF="005163_0009_1016CB2993BFBD88">
his An&s;wer; and &s;hews him the nece&s;&s;ary Qua|lification for that eternal Salvation, he was &s;oli|citous about.</P>
<P>But the Con&s;equence is the &s;ame, whether we fix upon the one, or the other of the&s;e Interpre|tations. For they who cannot be Members of <HI>the Kingdom of Grace,</HI> can never be Partakers of <HI>the Kingdom of Glory.</HI> We mu&s;t be qualified for that State; or utterly unqualified for this.&mdash; This awakening Le&s;&s;on is therefore taught us by both the&s;e Explications, that without <HI>Regene|ration</HI> there can be no Salvation: We mu&s;t be|come new Creatures, or peri&s;h eternally: An awful Thought! O that it were duly con&s;ider'd and laid to Heart, by a &s;tupid Generation of Men, who live at Ea&s;e and Security in a State of Nature, and con&s;equently in a State of Wrath and Perdition! This is a Thought that mu&s;t have its Influence upon them, either now while they have a Day of Grace, or hereafter, when they experience the Truth of the&s;e Words, by their Exclu&s;ion from <HI>the Kingdom of God.</HI> I pro|ceed to con&s;ider</P>
<P N="2">II. What we are to under&s;tand by being BORN AGAIN, without which we cannot &s;ee the King|dom of God.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this Point, I &s;hall fir&s;t give a general De&s;cription of this important Change, and then particularly con&s;ider the &s;everal Bran|ches of that De&s;cription.</P>
<P>Regeneration <HI>is a new &s;piritual and &s;upernatural Principle, wrought by the Spirit of God in all the
<PB N="6" REF="005163_0010_1016CB2BE6EE7DE0">
Faculties of the Soul, enclining and enabling unto the Exerci&s;e of a Life of Faith in Chri&s;t; and new Obedience to God.</HI> To be more particular.</P>
<P N="1">1. I con&s;ider <HI>Regeneration</HI> as being a new <HI>Principle.</HI> And thus the Scripture con&s;iders it. It is accordingly called <HI>the Seed of</HI> GOD, (1 Joh. iii. 9) <HI>the new Man</HI> (Col. iii. 10. <HI>the divine Na|ture;</HI> (2 Pet. i. 4) and <HI>the incorruptible Seed</HI> (1 Pet. i. 23) All which Expre&s;&s;ions plainly &s;ignify a new <HI>Principle</HI> of Action.&mdash;Our original Apo|&s;tacy, has brought &s;uch an univer&s;al Deprava|tion upon all the Faculties of the Soul, that the <HI>whole Head is &s;ick; and the whole Heart faint,</HI> the whole Nature Guilt and Defilement, all the Affections and Pa&s;&s;ions alienated from the Life of God; and <HI>the carnal Mind Enmity unto him.</HI> What therefore but corrupt Streams, can flow from &s;uch a poi&s;on'd Fountain? How can they that are in the Fle&s;h, ever plea&s;e God? How can they that are dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, perform any vital Actions? <HI>Can the Fig-tree, my Brethren, bear Olive Berries, or the Vine Figs? So can no Fountain yield both &s;alt Water and fre&s;h. Either make the Tree good; that the Fruit may be good; or the Tree will be corrupt, and his Fruit corrupt.</HI> There is a natural Nece&s;&s;ity, that all the Actions of an unregenerate Per&s;on, &s;hould partake of the Quality of tho&s;e carnal &s;inful Di&s;po&s;itions and Affections, from whence they flow. And there is the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity, that we be <HI>renewed in the Spirit of our Minds;</HI> and obtain a new Source and Spring of Action; or as our Lord
<PB N="7" REF="005163_0011_1016CB2E36AAB870">
expre&s;&s;eth it, <HI>a new Trea&s;ure of the Heart,</HI> in Order to our living acceptably to God here, or enjoying him hereafter.&mdash;There can be no Kind or Degree of moral Behaviour, no external Acts of Obedience, no Appearances of Piety and De|votion accepted of God, while our Hearts are e&s;tranged from him. <HI>The Lord looketh on the Heart.</HI> And what is the Heart of an unrege|nerate Man? The Scriptures tell us it is <HI>deceitful above all Things; and de&s;perately wicked.</HI> Jer. xvii. 1. Whence its of la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity, that <HI>a new Heart be given us; and a new Spirit put within us,</HI> in order to our <HI>walking in</HI> GOD'S <HI>Statutes; and keeping his Judgments to do them</HI> (Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27) Its of Nece&s;&s;ity, that we are <HI>created anew in Christ Je&s;us unto Good Works,</HI> if we would <HI>walk in them</HI> (Eph. ii. 10) It is of Nece&s;&s;ity, that God <HI>puts his Law in our Minds; and writes them in our Hearts,</HI> in Order to his being <HI>our</HI> GOD; <HI>and we his People</HI> (Heb: viii. 10)&mdash;<HI>Let no Man</HI> my Bre|thren, <HI>deceive you with vain Words.</HI> You mu&s;t not only have a new external Conver&s;ation; but a new vital <HI>Principle,</HI> if you would be the Chil|dren of God indeed. You mu&s;t be <HI>quickned, who are dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins.</HI> You mu&s;t <HI>hear the Voice of the Son of</HI> GOD <HI>and live;</HI> and partake of that <HI>Life, which is the Light of Men.</HI> You mu&s;t <HI>put off the old Man; and put on the new Man, which after</HI> GOD, <HI>is created in Knowledge and true Holine&s;s;</HI> or el&s;e you are never like to &s;ee <HI>the Kingdom of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="005163_0012_1016CB3196545AB8">2. I de&s;cribe <HI>Regeneration</HI> to be a &s;piritual and &s;upernatural Principle. And thus likewi&s;e doth the Scripture de&s;cribe it. <HI>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit</HI> (Joh. iii. 6) <HI>Of his own Will begat he us</HI> (Jam. i. 18) This Change is wrought by <HI>the exceeding Greatne&s;s of his Power; and ac|cording to the Working of his mighty Power</HI> (Eph. i. 19)&mdash;I know that there are &s;ome, that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, who pretend that this Change is the Effect of moral Sua&s;ion only: And that it is only thro' the Prevalence of out|ward Means upon their Minds, that Men are excited to become new Creatures, by the Im|provement of their natural Abilities, in the Ex|erci&s;e of moral Virtues; and religious Duties. That (according to them) the whole Work of <HI>Regeneration</HI> and progre&s;&s;ive Sanctification, is but the Improvement of tho&s;e Powers, which are given in common to all, that enjoy the Ordi|nances of the Go&s;pel. Tho' they will in Words acknowledge our Want of divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in Order to this Change, they &s;eem to allow no more of the peculiar and immediate Influences of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, in this great Concern, than in the common and ordinary Occa&s;ions of Life, How loath are poor proud Worms, to give God the Glory, of his glorious free Grace and divine Operations! How willing to think well of them&s;elves; and therefore to &s;light and re|proach all tho&s;e Experiences of the divine Power upon the Soul, which they them&s;elves are unac|quainted with!&mdash;But how doth the Scriptures,
<PB N="9" REF="005163_0013_1016CB33847D4AC0">
how doth mo&s;t clear and evident Experience repre&s;ent this Ca&s;e to us?&mdash; Are we not by Na|ture &s;piritually <HI>dead?</HI> (Eph. ii. 1) Can a dead Man by the Force of any Per&s;ua&s;ion, be pre|vailed upon, to rea&s;&s;ume his Life and vital Ac|tions? Are we not naturally <HI>without Strength?</HI> (Rom. v. 6) And can the Force of Per&s;ua&s;ion prevail with an enfeebled Cripple, or an ener|vated Paralitick, to ari&s;e and walk? Are we not naturally <HI>blind?</HI> (2 Cor. iv. 4) And can the Power of Per&s;ua&s;ion, enable a blind Man to open his Eyes and &s;ee? Are not our Minds naturally, not only Enemies; but <HI>Enmity</HI> it&s;elf <HI>unto</HI> GOD?

But the Order of Operation among the di&s;tinct Per&s;ons of the Trinity, follows the Order of their Sub&s;i&s;tence. The Foundation or Fountain of all Grace to Mankind, is the Love of God the Father&punc; The meritorious or procur|ing Cau&s;e of all Grace, is Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Sa|viour; and the Application of all &s;pecial Grace to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Souls, is by the Holy Gho&s;t.&mdash; So that when this Work of <HI>Regeneration</HI> is a&s;cribed to the Father, we mu&s;t rememb that <HI>he quickneth us by his Spirit.</HI> (Rom. viii. 7) When it is a&s;cribed unto the Son, we mu&s;t al&s;o con&s;ider, that he works this glorious Change, by <HI>&s;ending the Com|forter to convince of Sin, of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of

The Operations therefore of the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Spirit,</HI> in our new Creation, are in their Effects upon our Souls, always &s;en&s;ible and di&s;cernible; and al|ways felt by all that have them; tho' it be with many, the greate&s;t Difficulty to di&s;tingui&s;h their

<P>This then is of va&s;t Concernment to every one of us, that we do experience the Operations of the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Spirit</HI> upon our Hearts: That we have &s;uch a feeling Impre&s;&s;ion of our Guilt, Mi&s;ery and Impotence, as makes us reject all Confidence in the Fle&s;h: That we have &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible View of the Excellency and Sufficiency of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as inclines us to receive him upon his own Terms; &s;uch a View of the glo|rious Perfections of the divine Nature, as prompts us to love God above all; and to tru&s;t our Souls in his merciful Hands; &s;uch a Di&s;covery of the Beauty of Holine&s;s, as inclines us to be Holy in all Manner of Conver&s;ation and Godline&s;s; and &s;uch a lively Apprehen&s;ion of the eternal World, as makes us <HI>look not to the Things which are &s;een and temporal; but to the Things which are un&s;een and eternal.</HI>&mdash;However Men may deceive them&s;elves with their Reformations and moral Attainments, <HI>if they have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, they are none of his.</HI>&mdash;But of this more particularly under the next Head.</P>

<P><PB N="14" REF="005163_0018_1016CB40F2526688">Thus with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Under&s;tanding,</HI> it is not only enlarged by <HI>Regeneration;</HI> but renewed.

So likewi&s;e we are told, that <HI>the Eyes of our Un|der&s;tanding are enlightened, that we may know what is the Hope of his Calling</HI> (Eph. i. 18) Without this Illumination, <HI>the natural Man can|not receive the Things of the Spirit of</HI> GOD; <HI>for they are Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him, neither can he know them; becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cern'd</HI> (1 Cor. ii. 14) There is therefore a new and divine Light &s;hining into the Soul, in <HI>Regeneration,</HI> enabling us to &s;ee Things in another Manner, than we ever did or could do before; and giving us a more &s;en&s;ible Apprehen&s;ion of God, of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of the Concerns of the eternal World, than we could before attain to. As I have al|ready ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>In Con&s;equence of this, the <HI>Will</HI> is al&s;o re|newed.

his <HI>new Birth,</HI> &s;uch a Di&s;covery of the Evil of Sin, as makes him renounce his Lu&s;ts and Idols with Abhorrence; and groan after Deliverance from their remaining Power and Tyranny. The Per&s;on who before, would venture Soul and Body, Time and Eternity, rather than maintain a Life of Religion, and a clo&s;e Walk with God; has by this wonderful Change, &s;uch a Di&s;covery of the Plea&s;antne&s;s and Peace, that are to be found in the Ways of Wi&s;dom, that he prefers a Life of Piety and Communion with God, to all the Profits of the World; and Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e. Thus are we <HI>made willing in the Day of Chri&s;t's Power.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t add, the <HI>Affections</HI> al&s;o are renewed, when this Change is wrought in the Soul. They who are <HI>ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, have their Affections &s;et upon the Things that are above, where Christ Je&s;us &s;its at the right Hand of</HI> GOD (Col. iii. 1, 2)</P>
<P>They have <HI>new De&s;ires.</HI> Tho' they were before for <HI>fulfiling the De&s;ires of the Fle&s;h,</HI> they are now above all Things de&s;irous of the Favour of God, of an Intere&s;t in his Son, the Graces of his Spi|rit; and a continued Progre&s;s in Faith and Ho|line&s;s, until made meet for the final Gratifica|tion of all their <HI>De&s;ires,</HI> in the Emjoyment of God for ever.

<P>They have <HI>new Joys.</HI> Their temporal Acqui|&s;itions are no more the principal Matter of their Rejoicing; but they <HI>rejoice in</HI> GOD'S <HI>Salvation;</HI> and <HI>in the Hope of his Glory.</HI> This is the Subject of their chiefe&s;t Joy, when they find them&s;elves in a truly joyful Frame. They <HI>rejoice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, without Confidence in the Fle&s;h</HI> (Phil. iii. 3)</P>
<P>They have <HI>new Hopes.</HI> They have renounced their former vain Confidences; and can no lon|ger build their Hopes upon the &s;andy Founda|tion of their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, religious At|tainments, Purpo&s;es or Promi&s;es; but they now <HI>hope,</HI> not from what they do or &s;uffer for Chri&s;t; but from what he has done and &s;uffered for them, not from their Promi&s;es to him; but from his Promi&s;es to them. <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us is their Hope.</HI> (1 Tim. i. 1) <HI>Chri&s;t in them is their Hope of Glory</HI> (Col. i. 27)</P>
<P>Their Appetites are renewed, that the cove|tous Mi&s;er is no longer like the Hor&s;e-leach, <HI>crying, Give, Give,</HI> no longer eagerly &s;eeking great Things for him&s;elf; but labouring to con|tent him&s;elf with the Di&s;po&s;als of Providence, he is <HI>&s;eeking tho&s;e Things which are above, where Chri&s;t &s;itteth on the right Hand of</HI> GOD (Col. iii. 1) And thus the Epicure is brought to refrain his inor|dinate Pur&s;uit of &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure, the Drunkard to abhor his Cups; and the unclean Per&s;on his la&s;civious Lu&s;ts.

<P>The Bent and Bia&s;s of their Thoughts, and their habitual Cour&s;e of <HI>Meditation,</HI> is changed and become <HI>new.</HI> They are no longer <HI>carnally minded, which is Death; but &s;piritually minded, which is Life and Peace</HI> (Rom. viii: 6)&mdash;So great a Change does <HI>Regeneration</HI> always make, in the whole Soul! The&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Fruits of this new vital Principle, are all of them experienced, in a greater or le&s;&s;er Degree, by every one that is born of God.

<P N="5">5. I have de&s;cribed <HI>Regeneration,</HI> as a new Principle, inclining and enabling the Soul to the Exerci&s;e of Faith in Chri&s;t. And thus like|wi&s;e do the Scriptures con&s;ider it. <HI>Who&s;oever believeth that Je&s;us is the Christ, is born of</HI> GOD. <HI>He that believeth on the Son of</HI> GOD, <HI>hath the Wit|ne&s;s in him&s;elf</HI> (1 Joh. v. 1. 10) <HI>But as many as

received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name, which were born not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fle&s;h, nor of the Will of Man; but of</HI> GOD (Joh. i. 12, 13)&mdash;Faith in Chri&s;t is the fir&s;t Mo|tion, or vital Act of the <HI>new Creature,</HI> the fir&s;t Grace which is exerci&s;ed in the renewed Soul, Tho' <HI>Regeneration</HI> be con&s;ider'd, as being in or|der of Nature previous to Faith; yet in order of Time, they are always together. The &s;ame Time that the Eyes of the Soul are opened, they look to Je&s;us, as the Author of our eternal Sal|vation. The &s;ame Time that this <HI>new Creature</HI> is form'd, it lives; and acts Faith in the Son of God. Whence we are &s;aid to be <HI>created in Chri&s;t</HI> (Eph. ii. 10) i. e. to be immediately united to him by Faith, at our <HI>new Creation.</HI> Upon this Account, the <HI>new Birth</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> in Chri&s;t are &s;poken of in Scripture, as mutually implying each other.&mdash;The divine Light which &s;hines into the Soul in <HI>Regeneration</HI> not only gives a feeling Apprehen&s;ion of our own lo&s;t and peri&s;hing Con|dition: But &s;uch a View of Chri&s;t's Readine&s;s to &s;ave; and his abundant Fulne&s;s to &s;upply all our Wants, as con&s;trains us to con&s;ent to the Go&s;pel Offer; and encourages us to tru&s;t all our Intere&s;ts in his Hands. This Di&s;covery, brings the Soul to a hearty A&s;&s;ent to the Truth of the Go&s;pel, a chearful Con&s;ent to the Terms of the Go&s;pel; and a &s;teady Reliance upon Chri&s;t, as the only Foundation of our Hope.&mdash; It brings the Soul to receive him in all his Offices, as our
<PB N="19" REF="005163_0023_1016CB4C577C40B8">
Prophet to teach and guide us by his Council, as our Prie&s;t to attone for our Offences; and to be our Righteou&s;ne&s;s before God, as our King to &s;anctify our Souls; and to rule and reign in our Hearts. &mdash; It brings the Soul to receive him, notwith&s;tanding any Difficulties that may attend the chri&s;tian Life; and to &s;ubmit, not only to wear his Yoak; but to take up his Cro&s;s and follow him. &mdash; This receiving of Chri&s;t unites us to him, as the Branch is united to the Vine. Whence by a vital Union to this Stock, we re|ceive future Supplies of Life and Nouri&s;hment from him; and are enabled to live in the Ex|erci&s;e of all the Graces of the Spirit of God; and <HI>to glorify our heavenly Father, by bringing forth much Fruit,</HI> By the&s;e new Supplies received from Chri&s;t, the Believer <HI>walks by Faith; and not by Sight</HI> (2 Cor. v. 7) <HI>And the Life which he now lives in the Fle&s;h, is by the Faith of the Son of</HI> GOD (Gal. ii. 20.)</P>
<P>Thus it appears to be of la&s;t Con&s;equence to every one, to have this Witne&s;s in him&s;elf, that he is born of God. For <HI>without Faith it is im|po&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e</HI> GOD.

<P N="6">6. I con&s;ider <HI>Regeneration</HI> as a Principle of <HI>new Obedience</HI> to God.

And this Principle of which I &s;peak, is a continued Source of vital Piety, a living Fountain of Holine&s;s both in Heart and Life. He that is <HI>born of</HI> GOD, hates every fal&s;e Way, maintains a &s;trict Watch over his Affections, Appetites, Pa&s;&s;ions, Words and Actions, cuts off his right Hand and Foot; and plucks out his right Eye, when they offend him, maintains no Re&s;erve of &s;ecret and darling Lu&s;ts; but abhors and rejects them all, and groans under the Burthen of his remaining Corruptions, with &s;uch Language as that (Rom. vii. 24) <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the Body of this Death.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. It may be called a <HI>new Birth,</HI> becau&s;e it brings a Per&s;on into a new State of Exi&s;tence.

He that was before in a State of Guilt, has now by <HI>Regeneration, his Heart &s;prinkled from an evil Con&s;cience.</HI> He that was before under the damning Sentence of the Law, &s;hall now no more <HI>enter into Condemnation.</HI> He that was be|fore a Child of Wrath, is now <HI>at Peace with God;</HI> and <HI>made nigh by the Blood of Christ.</HI> He that was before altogether Pollution and Defilement, is now <HI>wa&s;hed and &s;anctified, in the Name of our Lord Je&s;us; and by the Spirit of our God.</HI> And in Fine.

<P N="2">2. It may be called a <HI>new Birth,</HI> as it brings a Per&s;on into a new Capacity for &s;piritual Action.

Manner, the &s;everal Duties of the chri&s;tian Life: Whil&s;t unrenewed, we are no more capable of the Exerci&s;e of Grace, than the Child unborn is of natural Operations. <HI>Without me</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t) <HI>ye can do nothing</HI> (Joh. xv. 5) But when <HI>rege|nerate</HI> and united to Chri&s;t, we can act from a new Principle, from new Motives, in a new Manner; and to a new End; and are enabled <HI>to walk in Newne&s;s of Life</HI> (Rom. vi. 4) Whence we are &s;aid to be <HI>created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works</HI> (Eph. ii. 10) Our Works before could not plea&s;e God (<HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 6) But now they are <HI>accepted in the Beloved</HI> (Eph. i. 6) Thus then we are <HI>born again,</HI> as we are brought <HI>thro' Sancti|fication of the Spirit, unto Obedience</HI> (as 1 Pet. i. 2)</P>
<P N="3">3. It is called a <HI>new Birth,</HI> as it makes us Heirs of an eternal Inheritance: As the King's elde&s;t Son, is born an Heir to his Crown. So as &s;oon as we are <HI>Children, we are Heirs: Heirs of God; and joint Heirs with Chri&s;t</HI> (Rom. viii <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">7) Thus are we &s;aid to be <HI>begotten</HI> (or as it is in the Ori|ginal, <HI>to be born) again, to an Inheritance incor|ruptible and undefiled, that fadeth not away</HI> (1 Pet. i. 3)&mdash;O how great is the Dignity, how glorious the Privilege and Hope, of all that have expe|rienced this Change! <HI>Beloved now we are the Sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we &s;hall be; but we know that when he &s;hall appear, we &s;hall be like him; for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is</HI> (1 Joh. iii. 2)</P>
<P N="4">4. This Change may be called a <HI>new Birth,</HI> with Re&s;pect to its in&s;tantaneous Production: As it is true in every Moment of Time, that a

Child either is, or is not born. So it is equally true, in every Moment of a Man's Life, that he is either in a regenerate; or in an unregenerate State. Whatever Oppo&s;ition this may meet with in the World, there can be no Demon&s;tration in <HI>Euclid</HI> more evident, than this Truth. It is impo&s;&s;ible but that every Man in the World, mu&s;t always, every Moment of his Life, be either converted or unconverted, a Believer or an Un|believer, a Child or God, or a Child of the Devil. There is no Medium. And one of the&s;e is cer|tainly at this In&s;tant, the State and Condition of every one of my Hearers. <HI>Ye are not in the Fle&s;h; but in the Spirit, if &s;o be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

<P N="5">5. It may be called the <HI>new Birth,</HI> with Re|&s;pect to our being altogether pa&s;&s;ive in its Pro|duction. As the Infant has no Hand at all, no Manner of Agency or Efficiency, in his own Birth. So in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, tho' we have a great deal to do, that we may be found in the Way, in which we may hope to have this Change wrought in us: Yet the Charge it&s;elf is God's own immediate Efficiency, the Di&s;play of his almighty Power, in which we can have no active Concurrence. As in the Creation of the World, the Creature could have no Hand in giving Being to it&s;elf. So in <HI>Regeneration,</HI> we can have no Hand in making our&s;elves <HI>new Creatures.</HI> This demands our mo&s;t &s;erious Attention; and &s;hould have &s;uch an Influence upon our Minds, as will

bring us to the Foot of God's Sovereign Grace. For let poor Pot&s;herds of the Earth, contend as much as they will with their Maker, they will yet find it true, that <HI>it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth; but in God that &s;heweth Mercy</HI> (Rom. ix. 16)</P>

<P N="4">IV. To give the Rea&s;ons why it is &s;o, that the <HI>Unregenerate cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God.</HI> And I &s;hall briefly ob&s;erve, that it is &s;o in an e&s;pecial Manner, for the&s;e two Rea&s;ons follow|ing.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e the&s;e can have no Righteou&s;ne&s;s to ju&s;tify them in the Sight of God. They have no Faith in Chri&s;t; and are therefore <HI>condemn'd already</HI> (Joh. iii. 18) And how can they attone for their innumerable Sins; and expiate the mountainous Load of Guilt that lies upon their Souls? How can they procure the Favour of God; and get into an E&s;tate of Reconciliation and Friend&s;hip with him? How can they purcha&s;e a Title to the eternal Inheritance? There is Sin enough cleaves to their be&s;t Duties, to encrea&s;e their Debt to divine Ju&s;tice; and to widen the Breach between God and them. All they can do, is therefore very far from Purcha&s;ing the Fa|vour of God; or giving them a Claim to his Salvation. There is Nothing can an&s;wer the De|mands of Ju&s;tice, but the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and this they have no Intere&s;t in. They have not received the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t by Faith; and therefore can have no Power
<PB N="27" REF="005163_0031_1016CB5EC821DD08">
to become the Sons of God. They con&s;equently remain (and while unregenerate they mu&s;t re|main) in a State of Enmity to God. And will God admit his Enemies into his Kingdom? No! &s;uch as the&s;e are to expect that terrible Sen|tence, from the Mouth of their Judge (Luk. xix: 27) <HI>Tho&s;e mine Enemies, that would not I &s;hould reign over them, bring hither, and &s;lay them before me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e they are utterly unqualified for that glorious Kingdom. That's a Kingdom, where <HI>no unclean Thing &s;hall enter.</HI> What has a Swine from a miry Sty, to do in a Prince's Palace, or a more filthy and polluted Soul in the Palace of the King of Kings?&mdash; God is a holy God, Heaven is a holy Place, the Saints and Angels forever exerci&s;ed there in the mo&s;t holy Employments. There is therefore no Room for unrenewed and un&s;anctified Souls.&mdash; Be&s;ides, the Unregenerate are altogether uncapable of the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the heavenly World. There is Nothing there to gratify their carnal De&s;ires: Nothing, but what is &s;o contrary to the Di&s;po&s;itions of their Souls, that it would render 'em mi&s;erable if it were attainable. We mu&s;t therefore all of us be renewed, and become holy in Heart and Life, If we would ever be admitted to the Perfection of Holine&s;s, in the Kingdom of God. For the Decree will quickly bring forth. <HI>He that is unju&s;t, let him be unju&s;t &s;till; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy &s;till</HI> (Rev. xxii. 11)</P>

<P N="1">1. This admini&s;ters Matter of Conviction and of mo&s;t awakening Concern, to much the greate&s;t Part of the profe&s;&s;ing World, in that it is vi&s;i|bly and undoubtedly true, that there are but few of the numerous Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, that have ever entred into this &s;traight Gate which leads to the Kingdom of God. There are but few among tho&s;e who enjoy the greate&s;t Privileges, and entertain enlarged Hopes of Salvation, that have been <HI>born again,</HI> and thereby <HI>made meet for an Inheritance with the Saints in Light.</HI> As this is true of the go&s;pelized World in general, &s;o may it be pre&s;umed to be al&s;o true, with Re&s;pect to tho&s;e who are now here before the Lord. And can &s;uch of you my Brethren, enjoy Peace and Security, who are yet in &s;uch a State and Condition, as to be under the Guilt of Sin the Wrath of God, the Tyranny of Satan, and the Empire of Death and Hell!&mdash; I have &s;hewn you the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of the <HI>new Birth.</HI> I have prov'd the Whole to you from that Standard of all Truth <HI>the Word of God.</HI> I have not been pleading for a Sect or Party. <HI>I have not handled the Word of</HI> GOD <HI>deceitfully;</HI> but have endeavour'd <HI>the Manife&s;tation of the Truth to every Man's Con&s;cience, in the Sight of</HI> GOD. And now I can with Confidence te&s;tify to you, that the <HI>new Birth</HI> which I have de&s;cribed, is <HI>the true Grace of</HI> GOD, <HI>in which you mu&s;t &s;tand</HI>&mdash; The Doctrine I know is exceeding repugnant to

Men's carnal Minds; and therefore meets with greate&s;t Oppo&s;ition. But it is the Doctrine of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, a Doctrine which he will vindicate, when you and I mu&s;t &s;tand before his Tribunal. Well then dear Souls! Con&s;ider what Pro&s;pect you have of the heavenly Inheritance. You hope to be &s;aved. But have you experi|enced the <HI>new Birth,</HI> as it has been de&s;cribed to you? I &s;ummon your Con&s;ciences in the Name and Fear of God, to give an impartial An&s;wer to this Demand. You have heard the &s;everal Properties and Characters of this &s;aving Change. Now then look into your own Hearts, and &s;ee if you can find them there. If not, how dread|ful is your State, how exceeding great is the Danger of your being &s;hut out of the Kingdom of Heaven forever! And can you &s;till <HI>&s;leep upon the Top of the Ma&s;t of a Ship!</HI> Can you &s;till <HI>cry Peace Peace, when &s;udden De&s;truction is ready to come upon you, as Travail upon a Woman with Child, whence you cannot e&s;cape!

<P N="2">2. This &s;hews us the dreadful Mi&s;chief of be|ing mi&s;guided by a deceitful Mini&s;try; and thereby obtaining Hopes of Heaven, without this &s;aving Change, which is (by the Verdict of our Lord him&s;elf) of la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity to all, that

would ever attain to that ble&s;&s;ed Inheritance. The la&s;t <HI>perillous Times</HI> are come, wherein <HI>many fal&s;e Prophets are gone out into the World.</HI>&mdash;What Oppo&s;ition does the faithful Preaching of this mo&s;t important Doctrine meet with, even from tho&s;e who by the mo&s;t &s;acred Bonds, are &s;et for the Defence of it. What Danger appears before us from our formal <HI>Laodiceans,</HI> who would quiet Men's Con&s;ciences with a mere Form of God|line&s;s, without the Power. And &s;ome of the&s;e would even put poor &s;leepy Sinners into a vain Dream of their having already received a <HI>bapti&s;|mal Regeneration;</HI> and thence encourage their Hopes of a &s;afe State, merely from their Mo|rality, or (as it is expre&s;&s;ed by a late Author) from their being upon the improving Hand, in gaining Ground of their Vices and Pa&s;&s;ions: And thus, the Nece&s;&s;ity of the converting and the renewing Influences of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit; and of a vital Union to Chri&s;t by Faith, begins to be left out of our Creed; and Sinners are flattered with an Imagination of Safety, without experiencing either the one or the other. But with Re&s;pect to &s;uch Teachers as the&s;e, I mu&s;t warn you in the Apo&s;tle's Language (2 Tim. iii. 5) <HI>From &s;uch turn away.</HI></P>
<P>Beware of any Preachers or Books, that a&s;cribe any Sufficiency to your&s;elves; or that would le&s;&s;en your Apprehen&s;ions of your lo&s;t, undone, guilty, peri&s;hing, impotent, and helple&s;s State by Nature. &mdash; For you are <HI>by Nature Children of Wrath</HI> (Eph. ii. 3) You are <HI>all under Sin</HI> (Rom. ii. 9)

<P>Beware of any Teachers that would le&s;&s;en your Apprehen&s;ions of the Freene&s;s and Sovereignty of the divine Grace. For God is ab&s;olutely Sovereign, in the Donation of his own Favours; And if he be&s;tows &s;pecial Grace upon any, it is <HI>even becau&s;e it &s;o &s;eemed good in his Sight</HI> (Mat. xi. 26) And you mu&s;t come to a feeling Sen&s;e that you lye at Mercy, before you have this great Change wrought in you.</P>
<P>Beware of tho&s;e Teachers, that &s;peak again&s;t, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e that ridicule and banter experimental Religion.

There is yet Hope in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> concerning this Thing. I am not ad|vi&s;ing you to give up all <HI>Hope</HI> of Salvation, when directing you to renounce your fal&s;e <HI>Hope;</HI> but only to quit your Expectations of Salvation in your pre&s;ent State; and from your own Attainments. De&s;pair would be the greate&s;t Di&s;honour to God; and Ruin to your own Souls, that you can be chargeable with. Take Encour|agement therefore, to exerci&s;e the mo&s;t earne&s;t, active and vigorous Application, to the Throne of Grace, in all the appointed Means of Life. For <HI>he that ploweth, may plow in Hope.</HI> You have as much Encouragement to hope for Mercy in &s;uch a Way of Duty, as any unconverted Man in the World ever had. None of the&s;e ever had any other Refuge to fly to, but the free Grace of God in Chri&s;t; and that Door &s;tands open for you al&s;o. <HI>Strive</HI> therefore <HI>to enter in.</HI> For God <HI>hath not &s;aid to the Seed of</HI> Jacob, <HI>&s;eek ye me in vain</HI> (I&s;a. xlv. 19)</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="005163_0042_1016CB7B3A99BD50">Let me entreat you to be earne&s;t with God, for the &s;pecial Influences of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit Cry earne&s;tly and con&s;tantly to God, that he would fulfil the good Plea&s;ure of his Goodne&s;s in your Souls. You can't procure a &s;aving Change in your&s;elves; and it is in vain to at|tempt it in your own Strength. Be therefore importunate with God, that he will <HI>quicken you by his Spirit dwelling in you</HI> (as Rom. viii. 11)</P>
<P>To conclude. Look to it, that you don't take up your Re&s;t, &s;hort of a &s;en&s;ible Experience of the divine Life in your Souls. Don't content your&s;elves, till you feel the Actings of Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, a hatred of Sin, a Love to God and Godline&s;s, a Life of &s;piritual Mindedne&s;s; and the Comforts of Communion and Fellow&s;hip with God: Don't re&s;t till you have lively Views of the eternal World; and an active Engage|ment of Soul in the Pur&s;uit of it. Don't re&s;t until you get more and more Victory over your Corruptions; and more and more Delight and Enlargement in your &s;piritual Cour&s;e. Thus <HI>laying a&s;ide every Weight, and the Sin which doth &s;o ea&s;ily be be&s;et you, run with Patience the Race that is &s;et before you, looking unto Je&s;us, the Author and fini&s;her of your Faith. &mdash; To him be Glory and Do|minion for ever.</HI> Amen.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS On a Di&s;cour&s;e of Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI>'s, entitled, <HI>Regeneration &s;tated and explain'd, according to Scripture and Antiquity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_HAVING in the proceeding Sermon, &s;omething di&s;tinctly con&s;ider'd the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of Regeneration, there will be no Occa&s;ion to take particular Notice of all that's exceptionable in Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e upon that Subject. I &s;hall therefore endeavour no more, than briefly to &s;hew in the General, that the Foundation upon which he builds his Hypothe&s;is is fal&s;e and deceitful; that his Doctrines are erroneous and dangerous, and his Arguments weak and inconclu&s;ive. For this is &s;ufficient to re&s;cue tho&s;e from the perillous Delu&s;ion, who have a ju&s;t Value for their immortal Souls, without making any &s;pecial Remarks, upon many particular Errors, &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted, without any other Evidence, than the great Name and Character of the Author.</P>
<P>The Di&s;cour&s;e I am con&s;idering, is the Sub&s;tance of two Sermons, preached from Tit. iii. 5. <HI>Not by Works of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;, which we have done; but according to his Mercy he &s;aved us, by the Wa&s;hing of Regeneration, and the Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Dr. interprets <HI>the Wa&s;hing (or Laver) of Regeneration in this Text, of Water Bapti&s;m, as</HI> (he tells us) <HI>the Antients always did; and the Rules of true Critici&s;m require</HI> (pag. 2) and under&s;tands <HI>this latter Part of the Text, to be nearly parallel
<PB N="40" REF="005163_0044_1016CB7E589D5C70">
to tho&s;e Words of our Lord, except a Man be born of Water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI> (p. 4)</P>
<P>In con&s;idering this Ca&s;e, I &s;hall fir&s;t give my Rea&s;ons, why I can't under&s;tand either of the&s;e Texts of a bapti&s;mal Regene|ration, and then proceed to &s;hew, that if they are to be under|&s;tood as referring to Water Bapti&s;m, they will prove no Foun|dation for the Doctrines, Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI> pretends to build upon them.</P>
<P>To begin with that in Tit. iii. 5. Why may not the <HI>Wa&s;h|ing of Regeneration,</HI> be here under&s;tood of the fir&s;t Conver&s;ion of a Sinner, whereby he is (as it were in a Laver) clean&s;ed from the former Pollution and Defilement of his Sins; and the <HI>Re|newing of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> be under&s;tood of a progre&s;&s;ive Sancti|fication; or el&s;e the latter Clau&s;e be con&s;ider'd as exegetical of the former, &s;hewing us, that <HI>the Wa&s;hing of Regeneration,</HI> is by the <HI>Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI> The Dr. tells us that <HI>the Rules of true Critici&s;m require,</HI> that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e under&s;tood. But certain it is, that the Rules of true Critici&s;m do not require that numerous Places of Scripture, both in the old Te&s;tament and the New, parallel to the Words before us, &s;hould be under|&s;tood in the Sen&s;e he pleads for: But on the Contrary make it nece&s;&s;ary, that they mu&s;t be under&s;tood in the View which I now propo&s;e. To exemplify this. That Text in Ezek. xxxvi. 25, 26, 27. mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be under&s;tood, according to my Interpretation of the Words under Con&s;ideration; and cannot by any rational and mode&s;t Con&s;truction, be forc'd into the Dr's Scheme. <HI>Then will I &s;prinkle clean Water upon you; and make you clean from all your Filthine&s;s; and from all your Idols will I clean&s;e you. A new Heart al&s;o will I give you; and a new Spirit will I put within you. And I will take away the &s;tony Heart out of your Fle&s;h; and I will give you an Heart of Fle&s;h. And I will put my Spirit within you; and cau&s;e you to walk in my Statutes; and keep my Judgments and do them.</HI>&mdash;In the&s;e Words it is plainly vi&s;ible, that by <HI>&s;prinkling with clean Water,</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood the fir&s;t Change made by Conver&s;ion and Regeneration; that Change by which <HI>a new Heart is given,</HI> and a <HI>new Spirit put within</HI> the happy Recipients of it; and <HI>the &s;tony Heart taken out of their Fle&s;h; and a Heart of Fle&s;h given them.</HI> This then, is <HI>the Wa&s;hing of Regeneration.</HI> And
<PB N="41" REF="005163_0045_1016CB8127840338">
is not God's <HI>putting his Spirit within them; and cau&s;ing them to walk in his Statutes, and keep his Judgments and do them,</HI> a progre&s;&s;ive Work of Sanctification; or <HI>the Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI>&mdash;I can't &s;ee any Appearance of Rea&s;on, why tho&s;e Words in Tit. iii. 5. mayn't be interpreted, as the&s;e &s;o appa|rently parallel to 'em, mu&s;t be interpreted. &mdash; If indeed this were the only Place in Scripture, were <HI>Wa&s;hing</HI> with Water; and the <HI>Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> were to be under&s;tood in the Sen&s;e I plead for, the Ca&s;e were more di&s;putable; but a di&s;tinct View of this Matter will plainly &s;hew us, that the like Phra&s;eology has this con&s;tant and invariable Meaning, through|out the Bible. Thus for In&s;tance in I&s;a. xliv. 3. <HI>I will pour Water upon him that is thir&s;ty, and Floods upon the dry Ground. I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Ble&s;&s;ing upon thing Offspring.</HI> I&s;a. lii. 15. <HI>So &s;hall he &s;prinkle many Nations.</HI> P&s;al. li. 7.10. <HI>Wa&s;h me, and I &s;hall be whiter than the Snow. Create in me a clean Heart O God, and renew a right Spirit within me.</HI> Joh. xiii. 8. <HI>If I wa&s;h thee not, thou ha&s;t no Part with me.</HI> 1 Cor. vi. 11. <HI>But ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;anctified, but ye are ju&s;tified in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of our God.</HI> Heb. x. 22. <HI>Having our Hearts &s;prinkled from an evil Con&s;cience, and our Bodies wa&s;hed with pure Water.</HI> Many other Texts to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, might be cited; but it is needle&s;s to enlarge.</P>
<P>If it be enquired, why this Metaphor of &s;prinkling or wa&s;hing with Water is &s;o con&s;tantly u&s;ed, to repre&s;ent our <HI>Regeneration,</HI> or that new Principle, whereby we are brought to the Exerci&s;e of Faith in Chri&s;t, and to a Life of Holine&s;s. I an&s;wer, there is &s;uch a lively Re&s;emblance, between the Wa&s;hing away of external Defilement with Water, and the Purifying our Hearts from internal Pollution, by Faith in the Blood of Chri&s;t, as renders this Way of &s;peaking mo&s;t pertinent, plain and familiar. And accordingly, the Apo&s;tle in the ninth Chapter to the He|brews, particularly &s;hews us, that all the legal Purifications among the Jews, were Types and Prefigurations of the Blood of Chri&s;t, by which (when received by Faith) <HI>our Con&s;ciences are purged from dead Works to &s;erve the living God.</HI></P>
<P>Another Rea&s;on why I cannot under&s;tand the Dr's Text, in the Sen&s;e which he pleads for, is becau&s;e <HI>Regeneration</HI> or the
<PB N="42" REF="005163_0046_1016CB83DA37A3B0">
<HI>new Birth,</HI> is &s;o very often &s;poken of in Scripture, without any Referrence to Water-Bapti&s;m; and con&s;equently ought in like Manner to be under&s;tood, in the Words before us. Thus Joh. i. 13. <HI>Which were born, not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fle&s;h, nor of the Will of Man, but of God.</HI> Gal. iv. 29. <HI>But as then, he that was born after the Fle&s;h, per&s;ecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even &s;o it is now.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.23. <HI>Being born again, not of corrptible Seed; but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.</HI> 1 Joh. iii. 9. <HI>Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit Sin. For his Seed remaineth in him; and he cannot Sin, becau&s;e he is born of God.</HI> 1 Joh. v. 4, 18. <HI>For what&s;oever is born of God, overcometh the World. &mdash; We know that who&s;oever is born of God, &s;inneth not.</HI> In all which Texts, where the <HI>new Birth</HI> is expre&s;ly mention'd, there is not the lea&s;t Appearance of any Reference to Water Bapti&s;m. And this will further appear to be the Ca&s;e, if we take Notice of &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, where the &s;ame Thing is &s;poken of in different Terms. For In&s;tance, to be <HI>begotten of God,</HI> gives us the very &s;ame Idea with <HI>Regeneration,</HI> or the <HI>new Birth;</HI> and is not only u&s;ed in the very &s;ame Sen&s;e, but is the very &s;ame Word in the Original, wherever it occurs. 1 Joh. v. 18. <HI>We know, that who&s;oever is born of God, &s;inneth not; but he that is begotten of God, keepeth him&s;elf, and that wicked One toucheth him not.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.3. <HI>Hath begotten us again, to a lively Hope.</HI> Jam. 1.18. <HI>Of his own Will begat he us, with the Word of Truth.</HI> 1 Joh. v. 1. <HI>Who&s;oever believeth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, is born of God: And every one that loveth <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that begat, loveth him that is begotten of him.</HI>&mdash;It mu&s;t al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> allow'd, that tho&s;e Texts of Scripture which &s;peak of our being <HI>created anew,</HI> or becoming <HI>new Creatures,</HI> or <HI>new Men,</HI> mu&s;t &s;ignify, the very &s;ame Thing, with being <HI>born again,</HI> or <HI>born of God,</HI> &s;ince both the one and the other, are Metaphors u&s;ed to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, with a De&s;ign to repre&s;ent our being brought into a new State, as then (in a &s;piritual Sen&s;e) begin|ning to exit, or to have Life. And if all &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tinctly con&s;ider'd, not one of them will be found to have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Reference to <HI>Bapti&s;m.</HI> To exemplify this. We read <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cor. v. 17. <HI>If any Man be in Chri&s;t he is a new Creature; old Things are pa&s;&s;ed away, behold all Things are

become new.</HI> Gal. vi. 15, <HI>For in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, neither Cir|cumci&s;ion availeth any Thing; nor Uncircumci&s;ion: but the new Creature.</HI> Eph. i. 10. <HI>For we are his Workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, unto good Works.</HI> Col. iii. 10. <HI>And have put on the new-Man, which is renewed in Knowledge, after the Image of him that created him.</HI></P>
<P>Now upon this View of the Ca&s;e, what Manner of Rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why the <HI>Wa&s;hing of Regeneration,</HI> mu&s;t &s;ignify <HI>Bapti&s;m?</HI> Mu&s;t it be &s;o, becau&s;e the Word <HI>Wa&s;hing</HI> or <HI>Laver,</HI> mu&s;t be literally under&s;tood and nece&s;&s;arily carries the Idea of <HI>Water</HI> in it? We find, by many In&s;tances of the like U&s;e of the &s;ame Way of Speaking in Scripture, that this Conclu&s;ion can by no Means be ju&s;tified. This Expre&s;&s;ion therefore, mu&s;t not be taken in a literal, but in a metaphorical and &s;piritual Sen&s;e. &mdash;Mu&s;t it be &s;o, becau&s;e the Nature of the Thing does &s;uppo&s;e and require this Interpretation? This Suppo&s;al al&s;o, appears to have no Foundation, as has been fully and clearly exemplified &mdash; If therefore it be a good Rule, to interpret Scrip|ture by Scripture; if we are ordinarily to find out the Meaning of a particular Text of Scripture, by the con&s;tant and inva|riable U&s;e of the &s;ame Manner of Diction, in other Parts of the Bible; this Notion of a <HI>bapti&s;mal Regeneration,</HI> has no Foundation at all in the Word of God.</P>
<P>If we &s;hould proceed to compare the Characters of the <HI>new Birth,</HI> in tho&s;e Scripture Pa&s;&s;ages which I have cited, with Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI>'s Account of it, we &s;hall find &s;till further Evidence, of his Mi&s;interpretation of the Text in Que&s;tion. For In&s;tance.</P>
<P>To be <HI>born of God,</HI> in the Scripture Account of it, implies that vital Principle, whereby we are enabled to believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Who&s;oever believeth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t is born of God.</HI> 1 Joh. v. 1. but in Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI>'s Account of it. A Man may be regenerat<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">, <HI>who receives Bapti&s;m (like</HI> Simon Magus <HI>&s;uppo&s;e) in Hypocri&s;y or Impenitency;</HI> when <HI>Par|don and Grace, and all Go&s;pel Privileges, are conditionally made-over to them, tho' not actually applied, by Rea&s;on of their Di&s;qua|lifications.</HI> (from p. 27 to p. 30)&mdash;That is in plain Terms, he may be regenerated, without any actual Application of any of the &s;aving Graces of the Spirit of God. And on the other
<PB N="44" REF="005163_0048_1016CB88D3933330">
Hand. Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is (according to him) &s;o far from being an Evidence of Regeneration, that a Man may have Faith in Chri&s;t, before he is born of God. <HI>Preventing Grace</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>mu&s;t go before, to work in the Man Faith and Repent|ance, which are Qualifications previous to Bapti&s;m.</HI> The&s;e he calls <HI>the fir&s;t and lowe&s;t Degrees of Renovation.</HI> (p. 13) He again tells us, that <HI>an Adult, coming to Bapti&s;m fitly prepar'd by Faith and Repentance; and afterwards per&s;evering to the End, &mdash;He is not yet</HI> (before Bapti&s;m) <HI>buried with Chri&s;t into Death, nor planted in the Likene&s;s of his Re&s;urrection; nor indeed cloathed with the bapti&s;mal Garment; and therefore in &s;trictne&s;s, he is not a Member of Chri&s;t, nor a Child of God.</HI> (p. 20. 22)</P>
<P>In the &s;cripture Account of Regeneration, <HI>who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot Sin, becau&s;e he is born of God. He keepeth him&s;elf, and that wicked One toucheth him not.</HI> 1 Joh. iii, 9, 18. But in the Dr's Account, a Man that is regenerated, may be &s;o far from having the Seed of God REMAIN in him, and from keeping him&s;elf that the wicked One &s;hall not touch him, that <HI>he may Revolt from God, either for a Time, or for ever</HI> (p. 12.)</P>
<P>In the &s;cripture Account of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> it is wrought in the Soul by the Word of God, as the ordinary Means, by which we are brought into the new Life. <HI>Of his own Will begat he us, by the Word of Truth.</HI> Jam 1.18. <HI>Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God.</HI> 1 Pet. i. 23. But in the Dr's Account of it, <HI>the Holy Spirit, in and by the U&s;e of Water Bapti&s;m, cau&s;es the new Birth</HI> (p. 3)</P>
<P>Moreover from the &s;cripture Account of this Change, the happy Partaker of it, lives a Life of Holine&s;s and new Obe|dience. <HI>He &s;inneth not, He overcometh the World. He lives in the Love of God and his Brethren. Old Things are pa&s;&s;ed away, and all Things are become new.</HI> He <HI>is created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works, which God hath before ordained, that he &s;hould walk in them,</HI> as appears from the Texts before cited. But on the Contrary, the Dr. &s;uppo&s;eth, that <HI>the Rege|nerate may finally fall from Grace</HI> (p. 18 in the Margin) And that &s;uch as have been &s;avingly regenerated may <HI>fall away by De&s;ertion and Di&s;obedience;</HI> and that <HI>a Per&s;on once &s;avingly
<PB N="45" REF="005163_0049_1016CB8A94241CD8">
regenerated, may afterwards lo&s;e all the &s;alutary U&s;e of it</HI> (p. 26) And that tho&s;e may be regenerated <HI>who receive Bapti&s;m (like</HI> Simon Magus <HI>&s;uppo&s;e) in Hopocri&s;y and Impenitency</HI> (p. 27)</P>
<P>The Reader is now to judge, which of the&s;e two Repre&s;en|tations of the Ca&s;e is right, and to chu&s;e which of them he will believe. Whether the Scripture Account, which declares all Believers in Chri&s;t to be <HI>born of God,</HI> or the Dr's Account of this Matter, who &s;uppo&s;eth a Man may be <HI>born of God</HI> without Faith in Chri&s;t; and that a Man may have Faith and Re|pentance, before he is <HI>born again;</HI> the Scripture Account, which repre&s;ents <HI>Regeneration</HI> as an abiding Principle, or the Dr's, which &s;uppo&s;es the regenerate may revolt from God, either for a Time, or for ever. He may chu&s;e, whether he will believe the Scripture Repre&s;entation, that the Word of God is the ordinary Means of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> or the Dr's Sup|po&s;al, that this is wrought by <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> only: the Scripture Repre&s;entation, that the Regenerate are a holy People, or the Dr's Suppo&s;al, that they may be Apo&s;tates, Hypocrites, and Impenitent. He mu&s;t judge whether this be not &s;ufficient Evi|dence, that the Dr. <HI>knew not what he &s;aid, nor whereof he affirmed,</HI> that he has laid his Foundation upon the Sand, and that his Super&s;tructure mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ink with it.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole then, we may &s;afely conclude, that the <HI>Wa&s;hing of Regeneration</HI> in the Dr's Text, does not, cannot &s;ignify <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> becau&s;e wherever the like Methods of &s;peak|ing are found in Scripture, they nece&s;&s;arily have a quite different Meaning, becau&s;e <HI>Regeneration</HI> is &s;o often mention'd in Scrip|ture, without the lea&s;t Reference to <HI>Water Bapti&s;m;</HI> and be|cau&s;e the Characters which the Scripture gives; and tho&s;e which the Dr. gives of the <HI>new Birth,</HI> are directly oppo&s;ite and incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>Since I wrote this, I happen'd occa&s;ionally to meet with Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI>'s excellent Sermons on <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and finding there a Paragraph mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, I could not forbear tran&s;cribing it. <Q>Now I have &s;hewn you (&s;ays he) from a Variety of Scriptures, under the former Heads, that every one whom the &s;acred Oracles repre&s;ent as <HI>born of God,</HI> receiveth Chri&s;t, overcometh the World, and &s;inneth not. But it is too plain, that the&s;e Characters do not agree to every
<PB N="46" REF="005163_0050_1016CB8DC95F1FC8">
one that is <HI>baptized,</HI> and con&s;equently it evidently follows, that every one that is <HI>baptized</HI> is not of Cour&s;e <HI>born of God</HI> or rege|nerate; and therefore that <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is not &s;cripture <HI>Regeneration.</HI> I think no mathematical Demon&s;tration plainer or more cer|tain, that this Conclu&s;ion. And therefore, whatever great and ancient Names may be urged, on the other Side of the Que&s;|tion. I &s;hall re&s;t the Matter here, without leading you into the Niceties of a Controver&s;y, &s;o ea&s;ily decided.</Q></P>
<P>I now proceed to con&s;ider, whether our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;peaks of <HI>a bapti&s;mal Regeneration,</HI> in Joh. 3.5. &mdash; And here it mu&s;t be premi&s;ed, that all the Rea&s;ons already a&s;&s;igned, why the other Text cannot be under&s;tood in this Sen&s;e, are equally con|clu&s;ive in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. All the Scriptures which I have cited, do as directly &s;erve to illu&s;trate the Meaning of this, as of the other Text. And all the Scripture Characters of the <HI>new Birth,</HI> are as applicable here, as they be there. To be <HI>born of Water, and of the Spirit,</HI> is the &s;ame Thing, with <HI>the Wa&s;hing of Regeneration, and Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and as I have made it appear, that the latter does not &s;ignify a <HI>bapti&s;mal Regeneration;</HI> it thence al&s;o appears, that the former can have no &s;uch Signification. I &s;hall however con&s;ider &s;ome further Rea&s;ons, why <HI>being born of Water and the Spirit,</HI> can|not be under&s;tood in the Sen&s;e the Dr. contends for.</P>
<P N="1">1. If being born with Water in this Text &s;ignifies Bapti&s;m, then there are none in any Ca&s;e what&s;oever, who dye unbap|tized, that &s;hall ever obtain Salvation.

<P N="2">2. Another Rea&s;on again&s;t a&s;&s;igning this Meaning to the Words before us, is our Saviour's upbraiding <HI>Nicodemus</HI> for his Ignorance of the&s;e Things. <HI>Art thou a Ma&s;ter in</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and knowe&s;t not the&s;e Things?</HI> (ver&s;e 10)&mdash;What Things does our Saviour Mean. &mdash;Does he upbraid him for not knowing the Nece&s;&s;ity of his Compliance with the Go&s;pel Ordinance of <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> and his being regenerated by the Spirit, in the U&s;e of that Ordinance? How &s;hould a <HI>Ma&s;ter in I&s;rael</HI> know the&s;e Things, which he had never read or heard of before?&mdash;This therefore cannot be our Lord's Meaning. But if we allow the Con&s;truction of the&s;e Words, which I am pleading for, the Reproof will appear mo&s;t natural and rea&s;onable. It was indeed a Shame, for a <HI>Ma&s;ter in I&s;rael,</HI> to be ignorant of that Birth of Water and of the Spirit, which is &s;o often &s;poken of by the <HI>Prophets.</HI> It was a Shame for <HI>Nicodemus</HI> to be ignorant of the Nece&s;&s;ity of being <HI>&s;prinkled with clean Water, and made clean,</HI> of having <HI>God's Spirit put within him, that he might walk in God's Statutes; and keep his Judgments and do them.</HI></P>

<P>He does not indeed tell us what it is, that he &s;ounds this Con|jecture of his upon, that we al&s;o might judge, whether the Name or the Notion was <HI>probably</HI> not altogether new in our Lord's Time.

<P N="3">3. Another Rea&s;on why this Text cannot be under&s;tood, as &s;ignifying a <HI>bapti&s;mal Regeneration,</HI> is our Lord's Interpretation of his Meaning, in the &s;ixth Ver&s;e of this Context. <HI>That which is born of the Fle&s;h it Fle&s;h, that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</HI> Whereby he plainly &s;hows us, that it was a &s;piritual Birth he &s;pake of; and they were &s;piritual Per&s;ons who had obtained it. Now could Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI> pretend, that all who were <HI>baptized,</HI> and &s;o (according to his Con&s;truction of the debated Text) were <HI>born of Water and of the Spirit,</HI> were truly &s;piritual Per&s;ons? No! he could not but acknowlege, that there are &s;ome of the&s;e, (like <HI>Simon Magus) in a State of Hypocrify and Impenitency.</HI> And it is vi&s;ibly and lamentably true, that the far greate&s;t Part of the <HI>Baptized,</HI> who (according to him are all <HI>born of Water and of the Spirit,</HI> have no Claim at all to the Character of &s;piritual Per&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="005163_0053_1016CB965B3FE038">The&s;e Things put together, make it appear to me equal to Demon&s;tration, that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t had no Reference to <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> in the&s;e Words under Con&s;ideration. We may not &s;uppo&s;e, that he po&s;itively pronounced all &s;uch uncapable of the Kingdom of God, who are by his holy Providence, denied the Opportunity of enjoying <HI>Bapti&s;m.</HI>&mdash;We are certain, that he would not upbraid <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> for his Ignorance of what it is im|po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have been acquainted with.&mdash;We are certain, that all baptized Per&s;ons are not truly Spiritual; and yet our Lord a&s;&s;ures us, that the <HI>Birth</HI> he &s;peaks of, has that transforming Efficacy upon tho&s;e that experience it, as to make 'em all &s;uch.&mdash; The&s;e Texts are therefore &s;afe in our Hands, notwith&s;tanding all Endeavours to wre&s;t them from us. And the&s;e two which I have now con&s;ider'd, are the only Texts in the Bible, which can with any Appearance of Plau&s;ibility, be urged in Favour of the Dr.'s Hypothe&s;is.

<P>But after all, &s;hould we allow that both the&s;e Texts have a Reference to Bapti&s;m.

<P>Be it then &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Ordinance of <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is here referred to, in both the&s;e Texts, it can in neither of 'em imply any more, than the Pledge, Sign, Seal, or Token of our <HI>Regeneration.</HI> It cannot imply, that <HI>Regeneration</HI> it&s;elf always accompanies this Ordinance; and that all who are <HI>bap|tized,</HI> are <HI>born again.</HI> If we allow this Sen&s;e of the Words, we thereby &s;uppo&s;e, that to be <HI>born of Water,</HI> is to re|ceive Bapti&s;m as a Pledge or Sign of our being clean&s;ed from our Pollution, by the divine Influences of the Spirit of God, and of our thereby becoming new Creatures, and as it were born a new.

All Di&s;cour&s;e therefore of a &s;piritual Birth, with Relation to the&s;e who live and dye in a carnal State, is but a Medly of Incon&s;i&s;tency and Contradiction.&mdash;Should we &s;uppo&s;e with Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI> (p. 28, 22) that <HI>the Holy Spirit has &s;ome Way or other a Hand in every true and valid Bapti&s;m;</HI> that <HI>the Holy Spirit is in &s;ome Sort offered to all that receive Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m;</HI> that <HI>the holy Spirit con&s;ecrates and &s;anctifies he Waters of Bapti&s;m, giving them an outward and relative Holine&s;s;</HI> and that <HI>the Unworthy are by their Bapti&s;m put into an</HI> external <HI>chri&s;tian State.</HI> What is all this to their being born of the Spirit?

Whatever Means he is plea&s;ed to make U&s;e of, in bringing about this ble&s;&s;ed Change; yet the Change it&s;elf, is by his own immediate Agency, without the Help of any other concurring Cau&s;e in its Production. <HI>The Wind bloweth where it li&s;teth, and thou heare&s;t the Sound thereof; but can&s;t not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth, &s;o is every one that is born of the Spirit.</HI> Joh. iii 8.

And if in this Sen&s;e only it be &s;aid, that he be purely pa&s;&s;ive, it is good and &s;ound Doctrine.</HI> (p. 17) I therefore in&s;i&s;t upon it, that this good and &s;ound Doctrine, does utterly &s;ub|vert his whole Scheme. If Man can have no Hand in the regenerating Act, but that is intirely God's, and Man can have a Hand in <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> it is then certain, that <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is not the regenerating Act, nor can in any Sen&s;e be called <HI>Rege|neration;</HI> but as it is an outward Sign, Seal, of Token of it.

<P>In a Word, the regenerating Act (upon this Hypothe&s;is) is nothing but <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> it&s;elf.

<P>To which I an&s;wer, that tho' I don't pretend to vie with the Dr. in the Knowledge of Antiquity; yet I can't but pre|&s;ume, from what little Acquaintance I have with the Doctrines of the Ancients, that they generally under&s;tood the&s;e Texts to &s;ignify <HI>Regeneration,</HI> in no other Sen&s;e than I have now la&s;t explain'd them. And what &s;trengthens my Pre&s;umption is, that &s;ome of his own Quotations plainly carry this Sen&s;e with them, and particularly that from St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> whom he has cited in Confirmation of his Doctrine, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aqua igitur, exhibens forin&s;ecus Sacramentum Gratiae, et Spiritus operans intrin&s;ecus Beneficium Gratiae, &s;olvens Vinculum Culpae, reconcilians Bonum Naturae, regenerant Hominem in uno Chri&s;to, ex uno Adamo generatum.</NOTE> expre&s;&s;y &s;hews us his Sen&s;e of this Matter, that <HI>the Water</HI> (of Bapti&s;m) <HI>externally &s;hews forth the Sacrament of Grace; and the Spirit internally operates the Benefit of it.</HI>&mdash;The Fathers &s;ome of them did in|deed (as was their u&s;ual Method of &s;peaking) u&s;e very &s;trong and hyperbolical Expre&s;&s;ions upon this Subject, which would almo&s;t lead one into the Apprehen&s;ion, that they held even the Popi&s;h Opinion of the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Sacraments, and of their conferring Grace <HI>ex Opere operato,</HI> by their own proper Virtue. But then when we find them on &s;et Purpo&s;e, de|claring their Sentiments of this Matter, denying the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of Bapti&s;m to Salvation; and calling Bapti&s;m <HI>Ob&s;ig|natio

<P>But it &s;ignifies but very little, what was the Opinion of the Fathers in this Ca&s;e. We have the Bible as well as they, and as good Advantages to under&s;tand the Meaning of it, as they had. And it is as well known by all that are any Thing acquainted with Antiquity, that they held many &s;uch ridiculous Opinions, as would now expo&s;e a Man to the Contempt and Scorn of the World, if he &s;hould make a Profe&s;&s;ion of them. To exemplify this, in an In&s;tance &s;omething parallel to the Ca&s;e before us. Some of them explain'd that Text Joh. vi. 53. <HI>Except ye eat the Fle&s;h of the Son of Mun, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you,</HI> to be under&s;tood of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and thence argued the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Infants partaking of that Ordinance, in Order to their Salvation; and they accordingly fed them with the con|&s;ecrated Elements. <HI>Sine Chri&s;ti Carne et Sanguine,</HI> (&s;aith St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Cont.</HI> 2 <HI>Epi&s;t. Prelog. Lib.</HI> 4.</NOTE>) <HI>nec parvuli vitam habere po&s;&s;unt, in &s;emetip&s;is. Without the Fle&s;h and Blood of Chri&s;t, neither can Infants have Life in them&s;elves.</HI> And thence it was the Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e Times, to give that Sacrament unto Infants, as the &s;ame Father tells us. <HI>Parvulis adhuc et infirmis, &s;til|lantur quaedam de Sacramentis.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">c. 4. <HI>in</HI> P&s;al. 64.</NOTE> <HI>Some Part of the Sa|crament is in&s;tilled or dropt into the Mouths of young and tender Children</HI> &mdash;I would now a&s;k the Dr's Admirers, whether this Argument from the Fathers is good and conclu&s;ive? If not, why is it urged? If it be, why don't they admini&s;ter the Lord's Supper to Infants? Why are the Fathers pre&s;s'd into their Service, when they think they will &s;erve their Turn; and rejected when they differ in Sentiments from them?</P>
<P>Another Argument the Dr. u&s;es to &s;upport his Interpretation of the&s;e Scriptures, is this, That <HI>there is no In&s;tance, no Ex|ample in Scripture, of any Exhortation made to Chri&s;tians, to be born anew, but to be reform'd only, or renewed in the inward Man</HI> (p, 32)</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="005163_0061_1016CBA961CFBF18">To this I an&s;wer. That one good Rea&s;on why there is no more Exhortations found in the New Te&s;tament unto profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, to obtain a regenerate State, or to be born again, is becau&s;e they to whom the Books in the New Te&s;tament were immediately directed, were con&s;ider'd by the in&s;pired Writers as being generally Chri&s;tians indeed, who had already experi|enced, and therefore could not now want a fir&s;t Conver&s;ion unto God. And its ob&s;ervable, that the Apo&s;tles in their Epi&s;tles to the Churches, addre&s;&s;ed them as being truly Rege|nerate; and accordingly, they directed their Epi&s;tles <HI>to the be|loved of God, called to be Saints.</HI> Rom. i. 7. <HI>To them that are &s;anctified in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, called to be Saints.</HI> 1 Cor. i. 2. <HI>To all the Saints which are in all</HI> Achaia. 2 Cor. i. 1. <HI>To the Saints which are at</HI> Ephe&s;us. Eph. i. 1. <HI>To the Saints in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which are at</HI> Phllippi. Phil. i. 1. <HI>To the Saints and faithful Brethren in Chri&s;t, which are at</HI> Colo&s;&s;e.

It is remarkable, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in his Introduction to every one of his Epi&s;tles to particular Churches, &s;alutes them as Saints, his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians</HI> only ex|cepted. Of the&s;e <HI>Galatians,</HI> he was <HI>was afraid, le&s;t he had be&s;towed upon 'em Labour in vain.</HI> Gal. iv. 11. <HI>He &s;tood in Doubt of them,</HI> ver&s;e 20. For the&s;e therefore he <HI>travail'd in Birth again, till Chri&s;t were form'd in them.</HI> Ver&s;e 19. or until they were <HI>born again,</HI> which is the Fruit of travailing in Birth, and the plain Meaning of having <HI>Chri&s;t formed in them.</HI> Here then is a clear In&s;tance of the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Rege|neration</HI> in profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, whatever Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI> alled|ges to the Contrary. I grant indeed with him, that <HI>this is not favourable to the Notion of a &s;econd Regeneration.</HI> (p. 33) But it is favourable to the Notion of the Nece&s;&s;ity of a fir&s;t <HI>Regeneration,</HI> even in nominal Chri&s;tians; and &s;hews the Apo&s;tles Concern for &s;uch, that they might now be <HI>born again,</HI> &s;ince he was afraid his former Travail in Birth for them, had prov'd in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="005163_0062_1016CBAC92BD1E80">And I mu&s;t further ob&s;erve, that tho' the Apo&s;tles in their Epi&s;tles to the Churches, con&s;ider'd them as Chri&s;tians, yet they frequently put them in Mind of the Importance of their being &s;o indeed, as well as in Profe&s;&s;ion; and to that End, repre&s;ented to 'em the Nece&s;&s;ity of the <HI>new Birth,</HI> either in expre&s;s Terms, or in Words that fully <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ply'd it. Thus Eph. iv. 24. <HI>Put on the new Man, which after God, is created in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s.</HI> Eph. v. 14. <HI>Awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t, and ari&s;e from the Dead.</HI> 2 Cor. v. 17. <HI>If any Man be in Chri&s;t he is a new Creature.</HI> Gal. vi. 15. <HI>In Chri&s;t Je&s;us, neither Circumci&s;ion availeth any Thing, nor Uncircumci&s;ion; but the new Creature.</HI> In all which Texts, the <HI>new Man,</HI> a <HI>Re&s;urrection from the Dead,</HI> or the <HI>new Creature</HI> (expre&s;&s;ions every Way &s;ynonimous to the <HI>new Birth</HI> as I have &s;hewn above) are propos'd, as nece&s;&s;ary to our eternal Safety. And the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity of the <HI>new Birth,</HI> to profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, is apparent from &s;undry Texts of Scripture before cited. For it is by this, that &s;uch get a Victory over their Sins. 1 Joh. iii. 9. By this, that they are brought to believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 1 Joh. v. 1. to live in the Love of God and their Neighbour, 1 Joh. iv. 7. to overcome the World, 1 Joh, v. 4. To conquer the Temptations of Satan, 1 Joh. v. 18. and in a Word, by this they have a lively Hope of future Glory, 1 Pet. i. 3. By all which we may &s;ee, that the Dr's Ob&s;ervation is founded upon a manife&s;t Mi&s;take, is fal&s;e in Fact, and would have been im|pertinent, if never &s;o true.&mdash;To conclude this Head. Does not our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf, in as &s;trong Terms as can be &s;poken a&s;&s;ure us, that <HI>except a Man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God?</HI> Joh. iii. 3. But he &s;poke this to <HI>Nico|demus,</HI> and <HI>Nicodemus was a Jew,</HI> (p. 14) What then? Was it &s;poken to <HI>Nicodemus</HI> only? Are not the Words an indefinite and unlimited Propo&s;ition, which equally re&s;pects the whole Race of Mankind, without any Re&s;triction, Exception, or Limitation? Certainly there is none will find him&s;elf ex|empted, when it comes to the great deci&s;ive Trial, by what|ever Imaginations he may at pre&s;ent delude him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It may be expected, that I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething to the Di&s;tinctions the Dr. makes betweeen <HI>Regeneration</HI> and <HI>Reno|vation.</HI> But its &s;ufficient in general to ob&s;erve, that if the
<PB N="59" REF="005163_0063_1016CBB080313990">
Notion of a <HI>bapti&s;mal Regeneration,</HI> be a mere Figment, with|out any &s;cripture Foundation at all. (as I think I have clearly proved) Then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Di&s;tinctions which he makes, with Relation to a <HI>bapti&s;mal Regeneration,</HI> are but Di&s;tinctions about a non-Entity; and therefore merely fictitious Impertinencies.</P>
<P>To this I &s;hall only add, that tho' it were right to &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Renovation</HI> in his Text, implies a progre&s;&s;ive Work of Sanctification, as well as to &s;uppo&s;e this to be different from the new Birth, or fir&s;t &s;aving Change, it will no Ways follow, that <HI>Regeneration</HI> is not al&s;o a &s;aving <HI>Renovation;</HI> but even this Suppo&s;al makes it nece&s;&s;arily appear to be &s;o. We are renewed by being born again; and from this new Principle, (put into Exerci&s;e by the Spirit of God&punc; flows a continued <HI>Renovation</HI> or <HI>Sanctification. The new Man is after God, created in Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s.</HI> Eph. iv. 24. And thence it is, that <HI>he that is born of God &s;inneth not, and cannot Sin;</HI> but <HI>purifieth him&s;elf as God is pure; becau&s;e this Seed of God remaineth in him.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over the many exceptionable Pa&s;&s;ages in this Di&s;cour&s;e, leaving the Reader to determine the Fate of the Super&s;tructure, by the Foundation upon which it is built, which I hope he has by this Time, a pretty full and clear View of. And &s;o I &s;hall proceed to &s;ome brief Remarks upon &s;ome Part of the Improvement he makes of the Doctrine, which has been con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>He begins with this Reflection, <HI>that 'tis very improper Lan|guage at lea&s;t, to call upon tho&s;e that have been once regenerated in their Infancy, who have had their new Birth already at the Font, to be now regenerated, or to bid them expect a new Birth.</HI> (p. 31, 32) But is it &s;o very improper Language, to call upon tho&s;e to be now regenerated, who have neither been regenera|ted in their Infancy, nor in any &s;ucceeding Part of their Lives, who have indeed enjoy'd the Sign and Seal of <HI>Regeneration</HI> at their <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> but are Strangers to the Thing &s;ignified; and are yet dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins?&mdash;That this is the &s;ad Ca&s;e of much the greate&s;t Part of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, is but too vi&s;ible, from the whole Tenour of their Lives and Conver&s;a|tions. And mu&s;t we leave them to go on &s;ecurely in the Paths of De&s;truction and Death? Mu&s;t we not call upon 'em to
<PB N="60" REF="005163_0064_1016CBB2D7DA4ED8">
<HI>awake out of their Sleep, and ari&s;e from the Dead, that Chri&s;t may give them Light?</HI> Mu&s;t we in a &s;cornful Manner be told, that <HI>&s;uch Application might properly be directed to Jews, Turks, or Pagans, or &s;uch nominal Chri&s;tians as have ca&s;t off their Water Bapti&s;m</HI> (p. 31) How much does it concern the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, the more earne&s;tly and con&s;tantly to u&s;e <HI>Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept,</HI> to inculcate this mo&s;t important Point upon their People, when &s;uch Attempts are made to lull them a&s;leep, in a dangerous and fatal Security. And how much does it concern our People in general, to <HI>hold fa&s;t the faithful Word, as they have been taught;</HI> and to <HI>be no more Children to&s;&s;ed to and fro, with every Wind of Doctrine,</HI> to the Lo&s;s of their precious and immortal Souls</P>
<P>The Dr. <HI>proceeds in the next Place to ob&s;erve, how very mi&s;|chievous it is many Ways</HI> (to call upon profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians to be regenerated) <HI>and therefore that it cannot be look'd upon as a mere verbal Bu&s;ine&s;s, or an innocent Mi&s;nomer.</HI> To which it is &s;uffi|cient An&s;wer, that this is the Doctrine of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, as I think I have fully prov'd; and there|fore whatever mi&s;chievous Con&s;equences Men may pretend to draw from it, the Mi&s;chief does not flow from the Doctrine it&s;elf, but from the Abu&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Among &s;ome other In&s;tances of the mi&s;chievous Con&s;e|quences, which he imagines from this Doctrine, he mentions and chiefly in&s;i&s;ts upon this, <HI>that many&mdash;may be apt to go in Que&s;t of what they call Impul&s;es or inward Feelings of the Spirit, which commonly are nothing more than warm Fancies, tow'ring Imaginations, and &s;elf-flattering Pre&s;umptions.</HI> (p. 36)</P>
<P>If by <HI>Feelings of the Spirit,</HI> he means, feeling or &s;en&s;ibly di&s;|cerning the Operations of our Minds, excited by the Influences of the Spirit, this is &s;o far from being a warm Fancy, or tow|ring Imagination, that it is nece&s;&s;arily experienced by every true Chri&s;tian. It is impo&s;&s;ible from the Nature of Things to be otherwi&s;e. Can a Man po&s;&s;ibly be under Conviction of Sin, under the Exerci&s;e of Repentance for Sin, of Faith in Chri&s;t, of Love to God, or of &s;piritual Mindedne&s;s, and not be &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e Operations of his own Mind? And does not the Scripture expre&s;ly a&s;cribe all the&s;e gracious Exerci&s;es of the Mind, to the Influences of the Spirit of God? So that all the
<PB N="61" REF="005163_0065_1016CBB482AB5598">
Graces of the Spirit of God, wrought in the Heart of an Adult Per&s;on, are always &s;en&s;ibly felt, tho' the Quality of 'em are not always di&s;tinctly known. And I mu&s;t add, that no one that has a true Love, either to his God or his own Soul, will be banter'd out of the Nece&s;&s;ity of experimental Piety, by oppro|brious Invectives and reproachful Characters; but will <HI>beware that no Man &s;poil him, thro' Philo&s;ophy and vain Deceit, after the Tra|dition of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But if by Impul&s;es and Feelings of the Spirit, be intended, Raptures, Exta&s;ies, Vi&s;ions, and enthu&s;ia&s;tick In&s;pirations. I leave all Pretenders to the&s;e Things, to the Dr's Di&s;cipline, and only add a Paragraph or two out of Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> upon this Head, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pneumatalogia. p.</HI> 186, 188.</NOTE> <Q>The Work of the Holy Spirit (&s;ays he) in <HI>Rege|neration,</HI> doth not con&s;i&s;t in enthu&s;ia&s;tick Raptures, Exta&s;ies, Voices, or any Thing of the like Kind. It may be &s;ome &s;uch Things have been by &s;ome deluded Per&s;ons, appre|hended, or pretended to; but the Countenancing any &s;uch Imaginations, is fal&s;ly and indu&s;triou&s;ly charg'd on them, who maintain the powerful and effectual Work of the Holy Spirit, in our <HI>Regeneration.</HI></Q> And again, <Q>Such Appre|hen&s;ions for the mo&s;t Part, are either Conceptions of di&s;temper'd Minds and di&s;compo&s;ed Fancies, or delu&s;ions of Satan, transforming him&s;elf into an Angel of Light, which the Doctrine of <HI>Regeneration</HI> ought not to be accountable for.</Q></P>
<P>That Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI> may do his Bu&s;ine&s;s effectually, he next proceeds to enter a Caveat again&s;t <HI>the Marks and Tokens of Regeneration. Tho&s;e</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that fir&s;t began to talk in this Way (and who have long been dead) might be pious and well-meaning Men, but they were not very happy in the U&s;e of their Terms, or in the Choice of their Marks</HI> (p. 42) The&s;e Marks he tells us, <HI>may be prudently thrown a&s;ide, as human Invention.</HI>&mdash;But who were the&s;e pious well-meaning Men, who&s;e Ignorance the Dr. complains of, but the mo&s;t Eminent of the reformed Clergy, in the early and pure&s;t Times of the Reformation? Happy had it been for the <HI>Church of England,</HI> if all her &s;ucceeding Clergy had as well under&s;tood, and as faithfully taught, the Marks of a regenerate State, as many of tho&s;e excellent Men

did, which he thus complains of.&mdash;Into what a &s;ad and lan|gui&s;hing State is practical Godline&s;s reduced in that Church, where &s;uch Doctrines as this pa&s;s current, and the Marks of Conver&s;ion are con&s;ider'd, as <HI>having a Tendency to perplex &s;ome, and to deceive others; and therefore prudently to be thrown a&s;ide, as Things of human Invention.</HI> (p 43)&mdash;What! are the&s;e of human Invention? How then does the Dr. bring in our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> as giving the Marks of a converted State. p. 43, 44 And why does the Dr. him&s;elf run into the Practice of the&s;e Things of human Invention, by giving Marks of <HI>a renewed Heart and Mind? What Marks</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>&s;hould a Man pitch upon to &s;atisfy him&s;elf in that Ca&s;e, but a good Con&s;cience? Or what Marks to &s;atisfy others, but a good Life?</HI> And again, <HI>if we &s;incerely endeavour to do the be&s;t we can, and are daily gaining Ground of our Vices and our Pa&s;&s;ions, and find|ing our&s;elves after the &s;tricte&s;t Examination, to be upon the improving Hand, then may we comfortably believe, that our Regeneration abides &s;alutary and entire, and that we are in a State of Salvation</HI> (p. 44)&mdash;Why (I &s;ay) did the Dr. practice the&s;e Things of human Invention? The Rea&s;on probably was, that he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure, from <HI>perplexing &s;ome, or de|ceiving others,</HI> by &s;uch Marks as the&s;e. And indeed there is no Rea&s;on to fear his giving any Perplexity to the Con&s;ciences of &s;ecure Sinners, by &s;uch an Opiate. But oh that there was as little Rea&s;on to fear his deceiving Multitudes of poor unrege|nerate Creatures, to their eternal Ruin!&mdash;Here is a Mark, by which a Man may conclude him&s;elf <HI>in a State of Salvation,</HI> without having ever been <HI>weary and heavy laden</HI> with his Sins; tho' it is &s;uch whom Chri&s;t invites to <HI>come to him for Re&s;t.</HI> Mat. xi. 28. without feeling him&s;elf &s;ick, tho' it is &s;uch to whom Chri&s;t is the Phy&s;ician.

from the Premi&s;es, and may be received with as full A&s;&s;urance as we can have in any Ca&s;e what&s;oever. I know men may wrangle perpetually, and by the Power of Words, make the mo&s;t de&s;perate Ca&s;e look &s;omething plau&s;ible. But I know al&s;o, that as Contradictions can never be reconciled, &s;o it is impo&s;&s;ible in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, to make the <HI>Regeneration</HI> de|&s;cribed by &s;ome of our epi&s;copal Clergy, to be the &s;ame with that de&s;cribed in Scripture, without making it appear on both Parts true, that all who are born of God, are true Believers; and &s;ome that are born of God, may <HI>neither have Faith nor Repentance;</HI> that all who are born of God, do not &s;in, and cannot &s;in; and &s;ome who are born of God may be <HI>in Impe|nitency and Hypocri&s;y;</HI> that all who are born of God may have his Seed remaining in them that they cannot &s;in; and &s;ome that are born of God, may not have his Seed remain in them, but <HI>may finally fall from Grace,</HI> with &s;undry more In|con&s;i&s;tences, before con&s;ider'd particularly. This then is no longer a Matter of Speculation, but of utmo&s;t Certainty, that they mean one Thing and the Scripture another, by <HI>Regene|ration;</HI> and that the&s;e are as much two Things, and as truly di&s;tinct and different, as any two Things in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Coroll.</HI> 2. From hence it further appears, that we <HI>cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God,</HI> in Con&s;equence of the&s;e Principles, e&s;pou&s;ed by &s;ome of our epi&s;copal Clergy. How har&s;h &s;oever the Con&s;equence may be &s;uppo&s;ed, it is neverthele&s;s infallibly certain.</P>
<P>Our Lord a&s;&s;ures us, that without <HI>Regeneration,</HI> we <HI>cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>What the&s;e Gentlemen call <HI>Regeneration,</HI> is not the <HI>new Birth</HI> which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour means, and which the Scrip|ture de&s;cribes: And therefore not the new Birth, by which we mu&s;t be prepar'd for the Kingdom of God, and without which we can never enter into it. As I have fully prov'd.</P>
<P>Their Principles teach, that there is no other <HI>Regeneration</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, than what they de&s;cribe as above.</P>
<P>The Scripture teaches us, that the Properties and Characters of that <HI>Regeneration,</HI> which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in Order to our entring into the Kingdom of God, are e&s;&s;entially di|&s;tinct and different from the Properties and Characters of that
<PB N="65" REF="005163_0069_1016CBBF09C3E890">
<HI>Regeneration</HI> which they de&s;cribe; whence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God in Con&s;equence of their Principles.</P>
<P>By this it appears of what Con&s;equence it is, to be &s;et right in this Matter.&mdash;I would not be here mi&s;under&s;tood, as though I determine all &s;uch uncapable of the Kingdom of God, who hold the Doctrine which I oppo&s;e. No! I doubt not, but &s;ome of the&s;e may have experienced in their Hearts, what they oppo&s;e in their Heads; and be practically acquainted, with what they are in Speculation prejudiced again&s;t. But the&s;e mu&s;t get to Heaven, in a Way very di&s;tant from their Principles; under the dreadful Di&s;advantage of a powerful Bia&s;s to incline them the wrong Way.</P>
<P><HI>Coroll.</HI> 3. It thence al&s;o further appears, how much &s;afer it is for our People, to hold fa&s;t the Form of &s;ound Words which they have heard, in this important Point, than to venture upon a Change, to the&s;e Schemes of our epi&s;copal Clergy&mdash;It mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that I am not now &s;peaking of the Di&s;cipline or Ceremonies of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> whatever Objections may lye again&s;t them; but of this great Article of our Faith and Hope, which is thus &s;ubverted by &s;ome of their Clergy. &mdash; Were it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be in the Right, our Profe&s;&s;ion is neverthele&s;s &s;afe. We are baptized in Obedience to our Lord's Command, as well as they, and have therefore as fair a Claim to <HI>bapti&s;mal Rege|neration</HI> as they can have; and are be&s;ides &s;eeking for <HI>Rege|neration</HI> di&s;tinct from <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> to qualify us for the Kingdom of God, Here then can be no Danger, if we act up to our Principles; and experience what we judge nece&s;&s;ary to our Salvation. But then, if our Sentiments are right, (which I hope by this Time I have a Claim to &s;uppo&s;e) what will become of them, who have no other, and who &s;eek no other than a <HI>bapti&s;mal Regeneration,</HI> to qualify them for the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Thus I have made &s;ome brief Remarks, upon what I e&s;teem'd of the mo&s;t dangerous Tendency, in Dr. <HI>Wa|terland</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> hoping that by the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, it may be of &s;ome U&s;efulne&s;s, for reclaiming &s;ome,
<PB N="66" REF="005163_0070_1016CBC16111BA90">
who have been too &s;oon led away from their Stedfa&s;tne&s;s; for e&s;tabli&s;hing others, in the Faith once delivered to the Saints; and for impre&s;&s;ing upon the Minds of our People in general, the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity of their experiencing a greater Change, than the mo&s;t of them have yet experienced, if they would ever enter into the Kingdom of God.</P>
