<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AS I am of the Opinion, that little Manuals of the Sciences, if they could be well done, would be of good U&s;e to young Beginners; what I aim at in this little Tract, is to be as u&s;eful to them as I can, in the Studies of <HI>Metaphy&s;icks</HI> and <HI>Lo|gicks,</HI> and this in order to the more particular Stu|dies of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Morals,</HI> by giving as clear Definitions as I am able in few Words, of the principal Matters and Terms whereof tho&s;e Studies con&s;i&s;t; which I have endeavoured to do, in an Order of Thoughts, gradually ari&s;ing one after ano|ther, in a Manner as in&s;tructive as could well be, in &s;o &s;hort a Compa&s;s. I have al&s;o propo&s;ed to &s;hew how the&s;e Studies, taking their Ri&s;e from the fir&s;t Beginnings of Sen&s;e, proceed on through the other Studies, to rai&s;e the Mind gradually to its highe&s;t Perfection and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THO' I would not be too much attached to any one Author or Sy&s;tem, exclu&s;ive of any others; yet whoever is ver&s;ed in the Writings of Bi&s;hop <HI>Berkeley,</HI> will be &s;en&s;ible that I am in a particular Manner beholden to that excellent Philo&s;opher for &s;everal Thoughts that occur in the following Tract. And I cannot but recommend it to any one that would think with Exactne&s;s on the&s;e Subjects, to peru&s;e all the Works of that great and good Gentle|man (as well as tho&s;e of <HI>Locke, Norris,</HI> or <HI>Mal|branch</HI> and <HI>Cambray</HI>) if it were for no other Rea|&s;on, at lea&s;t for this, that they will, in the be&s;t Manner lead him to think clo&s;ely, and to think for him&s;elf. And I was the rather willing to publi&s;h this <HI>Logick,</HI> becau&s;e I think <HI>Metaphy&s;icks</HI> a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Part of that Science, and that I apprehend it a great Damage to the Sciences that the old <HI>Me|taphy&s;icks</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="006859_0006_102A867873A8DE68">
are &s;o much neglected, and that they might be rendered the more plea&s;ant and u&s;eful by joining with them &s;ome Improvements of the Moderns.</P>
<P>THIS little Tract I have introduced with a &s;hort <HI>General View</HI> of the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of <HI>Learn|ing,</HI> wherein young Students may at once behold, as it were in Miniature, the Objects, Boundaries, Ends and U&s;es of each of the Sciences; their Foundation in the Nature of Things; the natural Order wherein they lie, and their &s;everal Relations and Connections, both with Re&s;pect to one another, and to the general End, viz. <HI>our Happine&s;s,</HI> pur&s;ued thro' them all.</P>
<P>THIS &s;eems to me as u&s;eful in the In&s;truction of young Beginners in the Sciences, as it is in teach|ing <HI>Geography</HI> to exhibit, fir&s;t of all, a general Map of the whole terraqueous Globe, in order to a more particular De&s;cription of the &s;everal Countries and Kingdoms in the following Maps; or in teach|ing <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> to give fir&s;t a general Delineation of the whole Sy&s;tem of the World, in order to ac|count for the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in the &s;everal particular Planets in the following Schemes. For, as in the <HI>natural World,</HI> one cannot have a ju&s;t Notion of any particular Country, without con&s;idering its Si|tuation in relation to the whole Globe, nor of any particular Globe, without con&s;idering its Situa|tion with re&s;pect to the whole Sy&s;tem; &s;o in the <HI>intellectual World</HI> (if I may &s;o call it) neither can one have a ju&s;t Notion of any particular Science, without con&s;idering it as it &s;tands related to the whole <HI>Circle of Learning,</HI> and the general End pur&s;ued through the Whole. And &s;uch a &s;hort Draught may al&s;o be of &s;ome U&s;e to Students, to di|rect and methodize their Thoughts, and enlarge their Minds, and at the &s;ame time engage their Applica|tion and Indu&s;try in the Pur&s;uit of their Studies.</P>

<HEAD>AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY of PHILOSOPHY. Exhibiting a general View of all the Parts of LEARNING.</HEAD>

<P N="1">1. LEARNING implies the Know|ledge of every Thing u&s;eful to our Well-being and true Happine&s;s in this Life, or our &s;upreme Happine&s;s in the Life to come. And as our <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> con|&s;i&s;ts in the Enjoyment of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> by the right Exerci&s;e of our Under&s;tandings, Affections, Wills and active Powers, it mu&s;t take in every Thing that relates both to <HI>Theory</HI> and <HI>Practice, i. e.</HI> both to <HI>Science</HI> and <HI>Art;</HI> for <HI>Science</HI> is the Knowledge of Truth con&s;idered &s;peculatively, and <HI>Art</HI> is the Knowledge of Truth con&s;idered as directive of our Practice for the attaining our true Good or Happine&s;s. And all the various
<PB N="x" REF="006859_0009_102A867F3B28A358" MS="y">
Parts of Learning may be reduced to the&s;e two, <HI>Philology,</HI> or the Study of <HI>Words</HI> and other Signs, and <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> or the Study of the <HI>Things</HI> &s;ignifi|ed by them. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. (I.) AS the Under&s;tandings of young Per|&s;ons, for the fir&s;t fifteen or &s;ixteen Years of their Life, are not ripe enough to enter into the &s;ublimer Studies of <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary that during this Stage they &s;hould be chiefly employ'd in the Study of <HI>Philology,</HI> or the Languages, to which &s;hould be added the fir&s;t Things in the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> both which are mo&s;t level to their juvenile Capacities, as they chiefly depend on the Imagination and Memory, which in Youth are mo&s;t vigorous and tenacious.</P>
<P N="3">3. (1.) WITH regard to Language, they mu&s;t be early initiated in the Rudiments of <HI>Grammar,</HI> or the Rules of <HI>Speech,</HI> relating both to the Ac|cidents and Connection of Words, and this both in their Mother Tongue, and other Languages, e&s;pecially the <HI>French, Latin, Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> in which let them go as far as may be in this fir&s;t Stage of Life.</P>
<P N="4">4. (2.) AS &s;oon as they have got a good No|tion of <HI>pure Speech</HI> by the Study of <HI>Grammar,</HI> let them learn the Nature of <HI>figurative Speech</HI> in <HI>Rhetorick:</HI> And from thence, as they go on to read the Cla&s;&s;icks, let them learn the U&s;e of the various Tropes and Figures in <HI>Oratory,</HI> which is the Art of true Eloquence, and explains the Topicks of Invention, the Rules of Di&s;po&s;ition or Order, and of Elocution or Delivery. And,</P>
<P N="5">5. (3.) AS they go on to read the ancient Hi&s;torians, let them apply them&s;elves to the Stu|dy of <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> con&s;idered as the Art of an ele|gant and ju&s;t Narration of true Matters of Fact
<PB N="xi" REF="006859_0010_102A8680D2CBD808">
for the Benefit of Po&s;terity. And that they may under&s;tand the Ancients the better, they &s;hould read the be&s;t modern Writers of Hi&s;tory, which that they may read with Advantage, they ought to have &s;ome ea&s;y In&s;truction in <HI>Geography</HI> and <HI>Chronology,</HI> and make u&s;e of the be&s;t ancient and modern Maps of tho&s;e Places, and Tables of tho&s;e Times, to which their Books relate, which will render what they read the more intelligible, and take the deeper Impre&s;&s;ion on their Memo|ries. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Magazine for <HI>October,</HI> 1748.</NOTE> "Hi&s;tory is a large Field, in which they will &s;ee the wonderful Series of Providence; &s;trange Turns of Fortune, &s;urprizing Occurrences, and an amazing Variety of Accidents; fooli&s;h Mortals labouring for Trifles, contending eagerly for Things they would be much happier without; &s;ome cur&s;ed in having their Wi&s;hes, rai&s;ed to the utmo&s;t Height of Power and Grandeur, only to be thrown down thence with the greater Obloquy and Contempt; others plea&s;ing them&s;elves with their Ob&s;curity, and laughing at the Noi&s;e and Bu&s;tle that &s;urrounds them." All which tend to give the Youth a good In&s;ight into human Na|ture, and lead them to true Wi&s;dom in their own Conduct.</P>
<P N="6">6. (4.) AS they go on to read the Poets, they &s;hould get &s;ome Knowledge of <HI>Poetry,</HI> con&s;ider|ed as an Art, being a ju&s;t and lively De&s;cription of Things or Per&s;ons, either real or imaginary, with an Elevation and Dignity of Thought, and with the Advantages of Numbers and Harmony, and every Kind of Ornament that Language is capable of, which will qualify them the better to entertain them&s;elves with tho&s;e great Ma&s;ters of Wit and Eloquence. "There is &s;omething
<PB N="xii" REF="006859_0011_102A86834681F078">
charming in Ver&s;e; &s;omething that &s;trikes the Ear, moves the Soul, rou&s;es the Pa&s;&s;ions, and engages the Affections," while it fills the Soul with the mo&s;t u&s;eful In&s;tructions, attended with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Delight. "It &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t Way of Writing, and in &s;ome Countries even older than Letters, and con&s;e|quently to have been the Voice of infant Nature in her early Bloom and native Sweetne&s;s. In it the Ancients explained their Sentiments, convey|ed their Laws, and delivered their Precepts of Morality in Fable; the People liked the In&s;truc|tions which came to them attended with Delight; and as they heard them with Plea&s;ure, &s;o they retained them with Ea&s;e." To this Head of Language belongs the <HI>Art of Critici&s;m,</HI> which teaches the true Force of Words and Phra&s;es, the Nature of Stile, and a true Ta&s;te, &s;o as to make a right Judgment of the Beauties and Ex|cellencies of any Performance in either of the&s;e Kinds of Writings.</P>
<P N="7">7. WHILE Youth are acquainting them&s;elves with the Rudiments of <HI>Eloquence, Hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>Poetry,</HI> they &s;hould al&s;o be learning the fir&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t Things in the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> (which indeed, as well as Words, do in &s;ome Mea&s;ure belong to the Doctrine of Signs) e&s;pecially Things that re|late to Practice, both in <HI>Arithmetick</HI> and <HI>Geome|try,</HI> which will very much tend to engage and &s;trengthen their Attention, enlarge their Capaci|ties, and ripen their Minds. And &s;omething of <HI>natural Hi&s;tory,</HI> with the Arts of <HI>Drawing</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> if they have a Ta&s;te for it, will be very plea&s;ant and u&s;eful Amu&s;ements. And the&s;e Stu|dies which they have begun in this fir&s;t Period, and (it is to be hoped) made a con&s;iderable Pro|gre&s;s
<PB N="xiii" REF="006859_0012_102A868646396DF8">
in, mu&s;t be afterwards continued and carried to further Perfection, and made their Diver&s;ion at Turns, while they</P>
<P N="8">8. (II.) PROCEED, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> to the further Im|provement of their Under&s;tandings and active Powers, in the &s;ublimer Studies of <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> which is the Study of Truth and Wi&s;dom, or the Knowledge of <HI>Things,</HI> as being what they really are, together with a Conduct corre&s;pon|dent thereunto, in the Pur&s;uit of true Happine&s;s; to which they mu&s;t go on when they are &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen Years old. "And what concerns us in the&s;e more exalted Studies is, that we be very exact and careful to attend more to Things than Words, and endeavour to make &s;uch Things our own as will prove real Accompli&s;hments to our Minds, and duly regulate both our Tempers and Manners; and &s;uch are the Knowledge of GOD and <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> for <HI>Philo&s;ophia e&s;t Rerum Divinarum Humanarumque Scientia,</HI> as <HI>Tully</HI> de|fines it, and comprehendeth every Thing, both &s;peculative and practical, upon the&s;e large and comprehen&s;ive Subjects.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE fir&s;t, which relates to GOD, takes in the whole Creation; the full Extent of Being; for by the Contemplation of the Effects we ari&s;e to the Cau&s;e. "And as by con&s;idering that wonderful and amazing Power, that All-compre|hending Wi&s;dom, that inimitable Beauty, that &s;urprizing Harmony, that immutable Order, which abundantly di&s;cover them&s;elves in the For|mation and Government of the Univer&s;e, we are led to their divine Original, who is the inex|hau&s;ted Source, the glorious Fountain of all Per|fection;" &s;o by making due Reflections on the Operations of our own Minds, and the large Ex|tent
<PB N="xiv" REF="006859_0013_102A8687D35EE0A8">
of our intellectual Faculties and their Ob|jects; their &s;everal di&s;tinct Exertions, and their Sub&s;erviency to each other; the free Activity of our Souls, and the various Pa&s;&s;ions that put them on Action for attaining our &s;everal Ends; and the various Ways wherein they exert them&s;elves, and exerci&s;e their Dominion over our Bodies; we may attain, in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure, the Know|ledge of our&s;elves, as well as of GOD, our chief Good, and the certain Means we mu&s;t u&s;e, and the Method we mu&s;t take to &s;ecure our true Happine&s;s in the Enjoyment of Him, our|&s;elves, and one another. In order to the rai&s;ing our Minds to the&s;e &s;ublime Speculations, and to regulate our Actions in the&s;e noble Pur&s;uits, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we be able to form to our&s;elves clear Ideas and Conceptions of tho&s;e <HI>Beings</HI> or Things on which we contemplate, whether <HI>Bo|dies</HI> or <HI>Spirits:</HI> To the Attainment of which,</P>
<P N="10">10. (1.) <HI>LOGICK,</HI> or the Art of Rea&s;oning, is very requi&s;ite, the Foundation of which is <HI>Me|taphy&s;icks,</HI> or the <HI>Philo&s;ophia prima,</HI> which, by &s;ome, hath been called <HI>Ontology,</HI> and is the noble&s;t and mo&s;t elevated Part of Science. It begins with &s;en&s;i|ble Objects, and from them takes its Ri&s;e to Things purely intellectual, and treats of <HI>Being</HI> ab&s;tracted from every particular Nature, whether <HI>Body</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> and of all the general Di&s;tinctions, Connections and Relations of Things, whether &s;en&s;ible or intellectual, and &s;o lays a Foundation for clear and ju&s;t Rea&s;oning, while we proceed upon &s;table and unerring Principles. Which Foundation being laid, <HI>Logick</HI> teacheth us the Rules of thinking regularly, and <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> ju&s;tly, whereby we learn to di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Truth</HI> from <HI>Fal|&s;hood,</HI> and proceed from Things <HI>&s;imple</HI> to Things
<PB N="xv" REF="006859_0014_102A8689C8126030">
<HI>compound,</HI> and from Things precarious and <HI>con|tingent</HI> to Things <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> &s;table and eternal, which therefore will re&s;ult in the cleare&s;t and ju&s;t|e&s;t Views, both of all other Things, and of the adorable Excellencies of the divine Nature, that our little Minds are capable of.</P>
<P N="11">11. (2.) FROM the&s;e general Principles and Laws of Rea&s;oning, we proceed to the Applica|tion of them, fir&s;t in the Study of <HI>Quantity</HI> in general, whether <HI>Number</HI> or <HI>Magnitude,</HI> in the &s;ublimer <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> or the Arts of Compu|tation. And here again opens a noble Scene of eternal Truth, in the Demon&s;tration of a va&s;t Number of Theorems and Problems, both <HI>Arith|metical</HI> and <HI>Geometrical,</HI> to which <HI>Algebra</HI> is wonderfully &s;ub&s;ervient, in the Contemplation both of <HI>Lines, Surfaces</HI> and <HI>Solids,</HI> in all their endle&s;s Varieties and Proportions; which will en|able us to proceed with the greater Advantage in the Study of Nature, and without which we cannot read with Under&s;tanding the be&s;t Things that have been written on that Subject. This Sort of Study hath likewi&s;e a direct Tendency to lead us to an admiring Sen&s;e of the Deity, in who&s;e infinite Trea&s;ures of eternal Truth, we be|hold the&s;e Connections and Demon&s;trations, who hath made all Things in Number, Mea&s;ure and Weight. To this Head belong, <HI>Trigonometry, Geodae&s;ia, Stereometry,</HI> the Doctrine of the <HI>Sphere</HI> and <HI>Cylinder,</HI> and of <HI>Conic Sections</HI> and <HI>Fluxions.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. (3.)

Nothing, I &s;ay, is more natural than to make the Things we know, a Step to tho&s;e we do not know; and to repre&s;ent and explain Things le&s;s familiar, by others that are more &s;o.

what is clear from what is doubtful, we may fir&s;t be &s;ure where the Doubt lies, and wherein the Merits of the Cau&s;e do really con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. THESE Things being fir&s;t duly ob&s;erved, the right Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on proper|ly con&s;i&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the right Ex|erci&s;e of Rea&s;on.</NOTE>&mdash;<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In taking a care|ful Survey of all the Relations which the Subject or Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">icate of the Que|&s;tion, or di&s;puted Propo&s;ition, bear to any other Ideas or Notions, and thereby &s;earching out and di&s;covering &s;ome third Idea or Concepti|on related to one or other, or both of them, which is called the Rea&s;on or Argument, and, as I &s;aid, may be con&s;idered as a common Mea&s;ure by which to judge of the Relation between them; the Foundation of which is that grand Maxim above mentioned (Chap. II. &sect; 22.) That <HI>tho&s;e Things which agree or differ in a Third, mu&s;t agree or dif|fer between them&s;elves;</HI> this is called <HI>Sagacity.</HI>&mdash; To which Purpo&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary that we endea|vour to con&s;ider the Whole of Things, and as far as we can, make our&s;elves Ma&s;ters of our Sub|ject; and in many Ca&s;es it may be of good U&s;e to have Recour&s;e to the &s;everal Topicks above ex|plained in the &s;econd Chapter, Cau&s;es, Effects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;And as all our Rea&s;oning takes its Ri&s;e from &s;elf-evident Propo&s;itions, we mu&s;t &s;ee to it, that the Connexion between them and tho&s;e we would prove, be made as clear and evident as po&s;&s;ible before we proceed to a Conclu&s;ion. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> When we have found an Argument, and duly con&s;idered its Relation to the Terms of the Que&s;tion, the Act of Rea&s;on con&s;i&s;ts in inferring, from the Agreement or Di&s;agreement of the Sub|ject and Attribute of the Que&s;tion with this inter|mediate Idea or Conception, their Agreement or
<PB N="61" REF="006859_0084_102A881BD821B048">
Repugnancy between them&s;elves: This is called <HI>Illation.</HI>&mdash;Thus, &s;uppo&s;e the Que&s;tion were, <HI>Whether Virtue be more valuable than Riches?</HI>&mdash;I fir&s;t con&s;ider the Nature of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Riches</HI> in all their Properties and Relations; I compare them with each other, and particularly with regard to our <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> which alone can render any Thing more or le&s;s valuable to us; and then, from that general &s;elf-evident Propo&s;ition, That, <HI>what mo&s;t contributes to our Happine&s;s is mo&s;t valuable,</HI> I in|fer, That, <HI>&s;ince Virtue conduceth va&s;tly more to our Happine&s;s than Riches,</HI> it mu&s;t upon that Ac|count, <HI>be va&s;tly more valuable.</HI></P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. THE Method of Rea&s;oning in the Schools is called <HI>Syllogi&s;m,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Syllogi&s;m.</NOTE> which con&s;i&s;ts in comparing the intermediate Idea or Ar|gument, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> With the <HI>Predicate</HI> of the Que&s;tion, which is called the <HI>Ma|jor Term,</HI> as being generally the mo&s;t exten&s;ive; for which Rea&s;on the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition is called the <HI>Major; Secondly,</HI> With the Subject of it, which is called the <HI>Minor Term,</HI> and therefore this &s;e|cond Propo&s;ition is called the <HI>Minor,</HI> and the&s;e two are called the Premi&s;es: And then, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> In making the Conclu&s;ion according as it is found to agree or di&s;agree with both, or either of them. If it is found to agree with both, it is affirmative; if with but one, it is negative.&mdash;As, &s;uppo&s;e the Que&s;tion were, <HI>Whether Ju&s;tice ought always to be practi&s;ed?</HI>&mdash;The Argument &s;hall be the <HI>Advan|tageou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of it.&mdash;Then the <HI>Major</HI> Propo&s;ition will be, <HI>What is advantageous in the whole is al|ways to be practi&s;ed:</HI> The <HI>Minor,</HI> That <HI>Ju&s;tice is ever advantageous in the whole:</HI>&mdash;Then the <HI>Conclu&s;ion</HI> will be, That <HI>Ju&s;tice is always to be practi&s;ed.</HI>&mdash;Or, <HI>what is mi&s;chievous to Society ought not to be practi&s;ed; Lying is mi&s;chievous to So|ciety;</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="006859_0085_102A88240C815EC8">
&mdash;therefore <HI>Lying ought not to be practi&s;ed.</HI> &mdash;The Ground of which Method of Rea&s;oning is this Maxim: That <HI>whatever can truly be uni|ver&s;ally affirmed or denied of any Subject, may truly be affirmed or denied of all or any of the Particu|lars or Individuals comprehended under that Sub|ject.</HI>&mdash;And if either of the Premi&s;es be yet doubt|ful, being denied, it mu&s;t be proved after the &s;ame Manner as before, till we arrive at two Premi&s;es, neither of which can rea&s;onably admit of any Doubt.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. SYLLOGISMS of this Kind are called the <HI>Categorick</HI> Forms, as being expre&s;&s;ed ab&s;olutely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the three Fi|gures of Categorick Syllogi&s;ms.</NOTE> and always con&s;i&s;t of only &s;imple Propo&s;itions.&mdash;In which the mo&s;t u&s;ual and u&s;eful are tho&s;e, where|in the intermediate Idea or Argument precedes, as being the Subject in the Major Propo&s;ition, which is always univer&s;al, and follows, being the Predicate in the Minor, which is always affirmative: and this is called the <HI>fir&s;t Figure:</HI> As, <HI>An infinitely wi&s;e and good Being cannot delight in the Mi&s;ery of his Creatures:&mdash; God is an infinitely wi&s;e and good Being;</HI>&mdash;there|fore, <HI>God cannot delight in the Mi&s;ery of his Crea|tures.</HI> But in &s;ome Ca&s;es it may be mo&s;t conve|nient to make the middle Term the Predicate of both the Premi&s;es, one of which is always nega|tive, and the Major univer&s;al; this is called the <HI>&s;econd Figure,</HI> as <HI>All Virtue is amiable; Avarice is not amiable;</HI> therefore, <HI>Avarice is not a Virtue.</HI> And la&s;tly, &s;ometimes it may be mo&s;t conveni|ent to make the middle Term the Subject of both the Premi&s;es; which is called the third Figure; in which the Minor mu&s;t be affirmative, and the Conclu&s;ion is always particular; as, Solomon <HI>did
<PB N="63" REF="006859_0086_102A88259D0C66C0">
not always act wi&s;ely:</HI> But Solomon <HI>was a wi&s;e Man;</HI> therefore, <HI>&s;ome wi&s;e Man doth not always act wi&s;ely,</HI> or, which is the &s;ame, <HI>All wi&s;e Men do not always act wi&s;ely.</HI> Much is here &s;aid by Logici|ans of the <HI>Modes</HI> of Syllogi&s;ms under each of the&s;e Figures, which is rather Matter of Curio&s;ity than U&s;e; but if any one de&s;ires to gratify his Curio&s;ity, he may &s;ee a mo&s;t complete and ac|curate Account of them in the <HI>Port-Royal Art of Thinking.</HI></P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. BUT the &s;ame Arguments may be di&s;|po&s;ed more familiarly in what is called the <HI>Hypothetick Form,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Hypothe|tick Syllo|gi&s;m.</NOTE> the <HI>Major</HI> of which is a conditional Propo&s;ition, as in the former Example: <HI>If virtue is, in the whole, more conducive to our Hap|pine&s;s than Riches, it is more valuable: But it is in the whole more conducive to our Happine&s;s: Therefore it is more valuable.</HI> So in a later In|&s;tance: <HI>If Lying be mi&s;chievous to Society, it ought not to be practi&s;ed: But it is mi&s;chievous,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>therefore ought not to be practi&s;ed.</HI> Here the ma|jor Propo&s;ition con&s;i&s;ts of two Parts, which are called the Antecedent and the Con&s;equent, and the Argument proceeds from the affirming or Po&s;ition of the Antecedent to the Po&s;ition of the Con&s;equent. But there is another Form of it which proceeds from taking away of the Con&s;e|quent to taking away of the Antecedent, as, <HI>If I had &s;aid &s;uch a Thing, I &s;hould have thought of it; But I never thought of it, therefore I never &s;aid it.</HI></P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Disjunc|tive Syl|logi&s;m.</NOTE> THERE is likewi&s;e another Form of Syllogi&s;m which is called the <HI>Disjunctive Form,</HI> in which the Parts mu&s;t be Oppo&s;ites, &s;o that the Po&s;ition of the fir&s;t mu&s;t infer the taking away of
<PB N="64" REF="006859_0087_102A882A0810E160">
the other, or of all the re&s;t, if there be more than two; or the taking away of the latter, or all the re&s;t, if more than two, mu&s;t infer the Po|&s;ition of the former; as, <HI>Every Man &s;erves ei|ther God or Mammon:</HI> Peter <HI>&s;erves God, there|fore he cannot &s;erve Mammon:</HI> or, Judas <HI>&s;erves Mammon, therefore cannot be a Servant of God.</HI> And to give an In&s;tance where there are more than two, <HI>Every Action is either good, bad or indiffe|rent; but to relieve a poor Man is a good Action;</HI> therefore it is <HI>neither bad nor indifferent;</HI> or, it is <HI>neither bad nor indifferent;</HI> therefore <HI>it is a good Action.</HI></P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. The&s;e are the chief Forms of Rea&s;oning to which all others, that are of any Con&s;equence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of irregu|lar Syllo|gi&s;ms.</NOTE> may be reduced. It may not however be ami&s;s to &s;ay &s;omething of tho&s;e which are called <HI>irregular Syl|logi&s;ms.</HI> Of which, &s;ome are <HI>redundant,</HI> as con|&s;i&s;ting of more than three Propo&s;itions, of which Number only regular Syllogi&s;ms con&s;i&s;t: In which Ca&s;e, a Rea&s;on is added to &s;upport either the Major or Minor, or both, before we proceed to the Conclu&s;ion. Others are <HI>deficient,</HI> as when the <HI>Major</HI> is left out or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in the Mind, be|ing under&s;tood, tho' not expre&s;&s;ed; as, <HI>Virtue conduces more to our Happine&s;s than Riches, there|fore it is more excellent;</HI> &s;uch are called <HI>Enthymems.</HI> But the mo&s;t noted of the&s;e irregular Syllogi&s;ms are the <HI>Dilemma</HI> and the <HI>Sorites.</HI> In a <HI>Dilemma,</HI> the major Propo&s;ition is a Conditional, who&s;e Con|&s;equent contains all the &s;everal Suppo&s;itions upon which the Antecedent can take Place, which be|ing removed in the Minor, it is apparent the An|tecedent mu&s;t al&s;o be taken away; as, <HI>If God did not create the World, it mu&s;t either have been
<PB N="65" REF="006859_0088_102A882F54964380">
&s;elf-exi&s;tent, or have derived from meer Chance; but it could neither be &s;elf-exi&s;tent nor derive from Chance; therefore it mu&s;t have been created by God. Sorites</HI> is a Method of arguing in a Series of Propo&s;i|tions, &s;o connected together, that the Predicate of the fir&s;t becomes the Subject of the &s;econd, and &s;o on, till we come to a Conclu&s;ion, in which the Predicate of the la&s;t Propo&s;ition appears from tho&s;e intermediate Propo&s;itions to be connected with the Subject of the fir&s;t. For an Example of the <HI>Sorites,</HI> we may &s;et down the following Way of Rea&s;oning, to prove the natural Immor|tality of the Soul.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Soul is a con&s;cious, intelligent, active, &s;elf-exerting Being.</P>
<P N="2">2. A con&s;cious, intelligent, active, &s;elf-exert|ing Being, as &s;uch, is intirely of an oppo&s;ite and different Nature and Kind from that of Bodies, and therefore can have nothing common with them but bare Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="3">3. A Being that, as &s;uch, is intirely of a different Nature from Bodies, and hath nothing be&s;ides Exi&s;tence common with them, can have no corporeal Properties and Affections, &s;uch as &s;olid Exten&s;ion, Continuity of Parts, and Divi&s;i|bility or Di&s;cerpibility.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Being that, having no corporeal Pro|perties, and &s;o does not con&s;i&s;t of &s;olid extended Parts, divi&s;ible or di&s;cerpible, cannot be naturally liable to a Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P N="5">5. What is not, in the Nature of it, liable to a Di&s;&s;olution, mu&s;t be naturally immortal. <HI>Ergo,</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The Soul is naturally immortal. And here the&s;e intermediate Propo&s;itions may be re|duced to &s;o many categorick Syllogi&s;ms, begin|ning with the la&s;t, and ending with the fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="66" REF="006859_0089_102A88318D22DE88">&sect; 8. THOUGH the Rules given above, if du|ly attended to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of So|phi&s;ms.</NOTE> would effectually pre|vent all &s;ophi&s;tical Rea&s;oning; yet it may not be ami&s;s to add a few Words concerning what are called <HI>Sophi&s;ms</HI> or fal&s;e Rea|&s;onings; among which, the chief are, 1. That which is called <HI>Ignoratio Elenchi,</HI> which is, when the Di&s;pute proceeds upon a Mi&s;take, occa&s;ioned by not attending to the true Meaning or State of the Que&s;tion. 2. <HI>Petitio principii,</HI> which is, when in pretending to argue, the Thing is ta|ken for granted which was to be proved; this we call Begging the Que&s;tion. 3. <HI>Fallacia qua|tuor terminorum,</HI> which is, when the intermediate Term bears a different Sen&s;e in the Minor, from the Sen&s;e in which it was u&s;ed in the Major. 4. <HI>Non Cau&s;a pro Cau&s;a,</HI> which is, when that is, by Mi&s;take, taken for a Cau&s;e, which was not the Cau&s;e; as, when a Per&s;on receives his Health con&s;equent to the u&s;ing &s;uch a Medicine, and a|&s;cribes it to that, when perhaps it might really be owing to a Medicine which he had u&s;ed before. And 5thly, the la&s;t I &s;hall mention, is that which ari&s;eth from what is called the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation of Ideas,</HI> where becau&s;e &s;uch Ideas are connected meerly by Cu&s;tom, we are apt to conceit they are connected in Nature, as Terrors with Dark|ne&s;s. On which Account it is of great Import|ance in Education, to take Care that no Ideas be|come a&s;&s;ociated by Habit or Cu&s;tom but tho&s;e that are connected in Nature; and on the other Hand, that tho&s;e Ideas that are really connected in Nature be a&s;&s;ociated by Habit or Cu&s;tom, that a Sen&s;e of their Connection may operate with the greater Force in the Conduct of Life. And thus much for <HI>Syllogi&s;m.</HI></P>
<P N="9"><PB N="67" REF="006859_0090_102A88349378B9D8">&sect; 9. THE la&s;t Thing in Logick, is that Cour&s;e of Rea&s;oning which is called <HI>Method,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Me|thod.</NOTE> which is only a regular Pro|ceeding in connecting a large Series of Rea&s;onings or In&s;tructions on any Subject, and therefore truly belongs to this Part of Logick which treats of Rea&s;oning. For in delineating a whole Science, or treating on any large Subject, it is nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue it thro' a long Chain of Rea&s;oning, or a whole Series of Propo&s;itions mu|tually related; in which it is of great Import|ance, both for the clearer under&s;tanding it, and the better remembering it, that we carefully ob|&s;erve the Order that Nature it&s;elf points out to us; &s;o as to begin with what is plain and &s;imple, and thence to proceed gradually to what is more compounded and ob&s;cure; &s;o ordering and rang|ing Things through the whole Proce&s;s, that what goes before may continually reflect Light upon what is to follow, and pave the Way to it; and taking the utmo&s;t Care to pre&s;erve Evidence, or at lea&s;t the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible Degree of Probability in every Step, till we arrive at the highe&s;t Truth and Good, or the Conclu&s;ion we aim at.&mdash;In order to which, the be&s;t Thing we can do, is to ob&s;erve diligently the Manner in which the be&s;t Writers proceed, in treating on any Subject they propo&s;e to handle, and particularly, the Mathe|maticians, and Morali&s;ts.&mdash;Now, I &s;ay, &s;uch a Series of Rea&s;onings we call <HI>Method;</HI> which, if it begin with Effects, and ari&s;eth to the Di&s;cove|ry of Cau&s;es, or with particular Facts, Parts or Properties, and ari&s;eth gradually to the Whole, and to general Principles, and Conclu&s;ions, it is called the <HI>Analytical Method.</HI>&mdash;But if it begin with Cau&s;es already di&s;covered, and de&s;cend to
<PB N="68" REF="006859_0091_102A883629491398">
Effects, or with general Principles, and de&s;cend, by the Application of them, to the Illu&s;tration or Proof of Particulars or Facts, it is called the <HI>Synthetical Method.</HI>&mdash;The fir&s;t is u&s;ed in &s;earching and di&s;covering Truth; the &s;econd chiefly in teaching it in the mo&s;t compendious Manner, when it is di&s;covered.</P>
<P N="10">&sect; 10. BUT in order to &s;ucceed well in the right U&s;e of our Rea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the di&s;|intere&s;ted Love of Truth.</NOTE> be the Form or Method what it will, whether in Thinking or Rea&s;oning by our&s;elves, or in a joint Searching after Truth, in our Conver&s;ation with others, which &s;hould be our only View in what is called Di&s;|putation, it is of the greate&s;t Importance that we ob&s;erve &s;ome &s;uch Rules as the&s;e; 1. That we habitually con&s;ider the Knowledge of <HI>Truth,</HI> as being the highe&s;t Perfection and Happine&s;s of our Minds, which therefore &s;hould be our grand Pur&s;uit, &s;eparate from every other Con&s;ideration. 2. That accordingly we po&s;&s;e&s;s our&s;elves of an ardent and di&s;intere&s;ted Love of Truth, for its own intrin&s;ic Excellency; and of the utmo&s;t Aver&s;ion to all Fal&s;hood and Deceit, or being any ways mi&s;led or impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e Co|lours, and delu&s;ive Appearances. 3. That in order to this, we hone&s;tly endeavour as much as po&s;&s;ible to dive&s;t our&s;elves of all &s;ini&s;ter Views and Prejudices, in favour of any vulgar Opini|ons, pre-conceived Schemes, or worldly Intere&s;ts, and guard our&s;elves again&s;t every untoward Ap|petite or Pa&s;&s;ion, that may darken or bya&s;s our Minds, and &s;o keep them as calm as po&s;&s;ible, and open and ready to the Impre&s;&s;ions of the naked Truth. 4. In order the better to come at Truth, we mu&s;t endeavour to con&s;ider, with the utmo&s;t
<PB N="69" REF="006859_0092_102A883866C01EC8">
Attention, the Things them&s;elves, with all their various Relations and Connections, dive&s;ted of the Delu&s;ions and Ambiguities of Words, which are many times apt to mi&s;lead us. 5. And la&s;tly, we mu&s;t enlarge our Views as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;o as to take the Whole of Things into our Con&s;ide|ration, without which we cannot make any tolera|ble Judgment of what relates to Particulars. If we would faithfully ob&s;erve the&s;e and the like Rules for the Conduct of our Under&s;tandings, and at the &s;ame time, be, above all Things, concerned to do our Duty, and to know the Truth, with this hone&s;t View, to be governed by it in Heart and Life, with all Humility, and <HI>without Par|tiality or Hypocri&s;y,</HI> we &s;hould not be in Danger of being mi&s;led into any great or dangerous Mi&s;takes, but &s;hould attain to know the Truth, <HI>and the Truth would make us free.</HI>&mdash;And thus much for the &s;everal Objects and Operations of the Under&s;tanding, which are the Subject of <HI>Logicks.</HI></P>

And being a perfect Stranger to every Thing about it, it hath every Thing to learn; to which it diligently applies it&s;elf, as its Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s more and more awakens, upon the Repetition, every Moment, of fre&s;h Impre&s;&s;ions of Sen&s;e; till, by Degrees, having a great Number of Feelings, Ta&s;tes, Odours, Sounds, and vi&s;ible Objects, frequently repeating their &s;everal Impre&s;&s;ions, its con&s;cious Memory &s;till enlarging, it begins, by Means of the intellectual Light, with which it finds its Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s attended, gradually to collect and recollect the &s;everal Relations and Connections it ob&s;erves to obtain among its various Ideas: And at length, when it is in Ea&s;e, it di&s;covereth a won|derful Curio&s;ity and Delight in ob&s;erving the&s;e Connections, as well as being impre&s;&s;ed with new Ideas.</P>

that the one hath the Nature of a Language with Regard to the other, and that the Connec|tion between them is to be learned only by Expe|rience, as that between Words and the Things &s;ignified by them:" And particularly, that as all vi&s;ible Objects or Ideas are only in the Mind; &s;o a Man born blind, and made to &s;ee, which mu&s;t al&s;o be the Ca&s;e of Infants, can have at fir&s;t no Notion of Di&s;tance, nor of any Connec|tion between Things vi&s;ible and tangible, and con|&s;equently, that both Di&s;tance and that Connec|tion mu&s;t be learn'd by long Trial and Experi|ence.

And, at the &s;ame time that it hath the&s;e Things to learn, which mu&s;t be a laborious Work, as being the &s;ame Thing with learning a Language, it is al&s;o learning the Names of Things, and the Connection and U&s;e of Words, which is another Language. And, as if all the&s;e were not Ta&s;k enough, it hath all this While, to be learning how to u&s;e its Limbs; its Hands in handling, its Tongue, and other Organs of Speech, in making and imitating Sounds, and its whole Body in all its Exertions, and particularly, at length, the Poize of its Center of Gravity, and the U&s;e of its Feet in walking.</P>

that tho&s;e little Creatures, from the Begin|ning, do con&s;ider, reflect and think a prodigious deal more than we are commonly apt to imagine;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Ca|pacity of Children, and the Re|gard due to them.</NOTE> and I do not &s;ee how we can avoid admitting that the Soul's Capacity is as great from the fir&s;t Moment as ever it is.

And con&s;equently the Rea&s;on why there appear &s;o many little, low, weak and childi&s;h Things in them, which we are apt to de&s;pi&s;e and think them beneath our Notice, is not for want of good Sen&s;e and Capacity, but meerly for want of Ex|perience and Opportunity for intellectual Im|provements. Hence al&s;o it appears, that we ought to think little Children to be Per&s;ons of much more Importance than we u&s;ually appre|hend them to be; and how indulgent we &s;hould be to their inqui&s;itive Curio&s;ity as being Strangers; with how much Candour, Patience and Care, we ought to bear with them and in&s;truct them; with how much Decency, Honour and Integrity, we ought to treat them; and how careful it concerns us to be, not to &s;ay or do any Thing to them, or before them, that &s;avours of Fal&s;hood or Deceit, or that is in any Kind indecent or vitious. <HI>Pueris maxima debetur Reverentia,</HI> is a good trite old Saying.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A BEAUTIFUL SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF UNIVERSAL NATURE,</HI> By Bi&s;hop <HI>BERKELEY,</HI> in rea&s;oning again&s;t the Sceptics, near the Beginning of the <HI>Second</HI> of his <HI>Three Dialogues.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LOOK! Are not the Fields covered with a delightful Verdure? Is there not &s;omething in the Woods and Groves, in the Rivers and clear Springs, that &s;ooths, that &s;oftens, that tran&s;|ports the Soul? At the Pro&s;pect of the wide and deep Ocean, or &s;ome huge Mountain, who&s;e Top is lo&s;t in the Clouds, or of an old gloomy Fore&s;t, are not our Minds filled with a plea&s;ing Horror? Even in the Rocks and De&s;arts, is there not an agreeable Wildne&s;s? How &s;incere a Plea|&s;ure is it to behold the natural Beauties of the Earth! To pre&s;erve and renew our Reli&s;h for them, is not the Veil of Night alternately drawn over her Face, and doth &s;he not change her Dre&s;s with the Sea&s;ons? How aptly are the Elements di&s;po&s;ed? What Variety and U&s;e in Stones and Metals, and even in the meane&s;t Productions of Nature? What Delicacy, what Beauty, what Contrivance in vegetable and animal Bodies? How exqui&s;itely are all Things &s;uited as well to their
<PB N="98" REF="006859_0121_102AABED3AC808E0">
particular Ends, as to con&s;titute appo&s;ite Parts of the Whole? And while they mutually aid and &s;upport, do they not al&s;o &s;et off and illu&s;trate each other? Rai&s;e now your Thoughts from this Ball of Earth, to all tho&s;e wondrous Lumina|ries that adorn the high Arch of Heaven. What an in&s;upportably &s;plendid and glorious Body is the Sun, the Center of this our Sy&s;tem, and the inexhau&s;tible Fountain of that va&s;t aetherial Fluid, which is the Light and Life of this whole Crea|tion? The Motion and Situation of the Planets, are they not admirable for U&s;e and Order? Were tho&s;e (mi&s;called <HI>Erratic</HI>) Globes e'er known to &s;tray in their repeated Journeys through the path|le&s;s Void? Do they not mea&s;ure Areas round the Sun, ever proportioned to the Times? So fixed, &s;o immutable are the Laws by which the un&s;een Author of Nature actuates the Univer&s;e! How vivid and radiant is the Lu&s;tre of the fixed Stars? How magnificent and rich that negligent Profu|&s;ion, with which they appear to be &s;cattered throughout the whole azure Vault? Yet if you take the Tele&s;cope, it brings into your Sight a new Ho&s;t of Stars that e&s;cape the naked Eye. Here they &s;eem contiguous and minute, but to a nearer View, immen&s;e Orbs of Light, at various Di&s;tances, far &s;unk in the Aby&s;s of Space! Now you mu&s;t call Imagination to your Aid. The feeble narrow Sen&s;e cannot de&s;cry innumerable Worlds revolving round the central Fires; and in tho&s;e Worlds the Energy of an All-perfect Mind di&s;play'd in endle&s;s Forms! But neither Sen&s;e nor Imagination are big enough to comprehend the boundle&s;s Extent, with all its glittering Furni|ture! Though the labouring Mind exert and &s;train each Power to its utmo&s;t Reach, there &s;till

&s;tands out ungra&s;ped a Surplu&s;age immea&s;ura|ble! Yet all the va&s;t Bodies that compo&s;e this mighty Frame, how di&s;tant and remote &s;oever, are by &s;ome &s;ecret Mechani&s;m, &s;ome divine Art and Force, linked in a mutual Dependance and Intercour&s;e with each other; even with this Earth, which was almo&s;t &s;lipt from my Thoughts, and lo&s;t in the Croud of Worlds! Is not the whole Sy&s;tem immen&s;e, beautiful, glorious, be|yond Expre&s;&s;ion, and beyond Thought? What Treatment then do tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers de&s;erve, who would deprive the&s;e noble and delightful Scenes of all Reality? How &s;hould tho&s;e Prin|ciples be entertained, that lead us to think all the vi&s;ible Beauty of the Creation a fal&s;e imaginary Glare?</P>

<HEAD><HI>A PHILOSOPHICAL MEDITATION, OR PRAYER, Of the late Archbi&s;hop of</HI> CAMBRAY: In his Demon&s;tration of the Exi&s;tence of GOD, as it is expre&s;&s;ed (nearly) by Bi&s;hop <HI>BERKELEY,</HI> in the <HI>Guardian, No.</HI> 69.</HEAD>
<P>O My GOD, if the greater Number of Mankind do not di&s;cover Thee in that glo|rious Show of Nature which thou ha&s;t placed before our Eyes, it is not becau&s;e thou art far from every one of us, for it is <HI>in Thee that we live, and move, and have our Being:</HI> Thou art pre|&s;ent to us more than any Object which we touch with our Hands, but our Sen&s;es and the Pa&s;&s;ions which they produce in us, turn our Attention from Thee. Thy Light <HI>&s;hines in the mid&s;t of Darkne&s;s, but the Darkne&s;s comprehendeth it not.</HI> Thou, O Lord, do&s;t every where di&s;play thy&s;elf: Thou &s;hine&s;t forth in all thy Works, but art not regarded by heedle&s;s and unthinking Man. The
<PB N="101" REF="006859_0124_102AABF3DCDE26E8">
whole Creation talks aloud of Thee, and echoes with the Repetition of Thy holy Name: But &s;uch is our In&s;en&s;ibility, that we are deaf to the great and univer&s;al Voice of Nature. Thou art every where about us, and within us, but we wander from our&s;elves, become Strangers to our own Souls, and do not apprehend Thy Pre&s;ence. O Thou, who art the eternal Fountain of Light and Beauty; who art the Ancient of Days, with|out Beginning, and without End: O Thou, who art the Life of all that truly live, tho&s;e can never fail to find Thee who &s;eek for Thee within them|&s;elves. But alas! the very Gifts which Thou be|&s;towe&s;t upon us do &s;o employ our Thoughts, that they divert us from perceiving the Hand that conveys them to us. We live in Thee, and by Thee, and yet we live without thinking of Thee: But, O Lord, what is Life in the Ignorance of Thee? A dead inactive Piece of Matter, a Flower that withers, a River that glides away, a Palace that ha&s;tens to its Ruin, a Picture made up of fading Colours, a Ma&s;s of &s;hining Ore; the&s;e, and &s;uch Things as the&s;e, &s;trike our Imagina|tions, and make us &s;en&s;ible of their Exi&s;tence, we regard them as Objects capable of giving us Plea&s;ure, not con&s;idering that <HI>Thou</HI> conveye&s;t to us, <HI>through</HI> them, all the Plea&s;ure which we imagine <HI>they</HI> give us. Such empty Objects of Sen&s;e as are only the Shadows of Being, take up and engage our low and groveling Thoughts, while that Beauty which Thou ha&s;t poured out on Thy Creation is as a Veil that hides Thee from our Eyes. As Thou art a Being too pure and exalted to pa&s;s thro' our Sen&s;es, Thou art not regarded by Men who have deba&s;ed their Nature, and made
<PB N="102" REF="006859_0125_102AABF71D603BB0">
them&s;elves like the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. So infatu|ated are they, that notwith&s;tanding they know what is Truth and Good, Wi&s;dom and Virtue, Law and Order, which (tho' the mo&s;t real and &s;table Things) have neither Figure, nor Colour, nor Sound, nor Ta&s;te, nor Smell, nor any other &s;en&s;ible Quality, yet they can doubt of Thy Ex|i&s;tence, becau&s;e Thou art not apprehended by the gro&s;&s;er Organs of Sen&s;e. Wretches that we are! we con&s;ider Shadows as Realities, and Truth as a Phantom: That which is nothing is all to us, and that which is all appears to us as nothing. But what do we &s;ee in all Nature but Thee, O my God? Thou and only Thou appeare&s;t in every Thing. When I con&s;ider Thee, O Lord, I am &s;wallowed up, and lo&s;t in the Contemplation of Thee. Every Thing be&s;ides Thee, even my own Exi&s;tence, vani&s;hes and di&s;appears in Con|templation of Thee: I am a&s;toni&s;hed and fall in|to nothing when I think of Thee! The Man who does not &s;ee Thee has beheld nothing: He who does not ta&s;te Thee has a Reli&s;h of nothing; his Being is vain, and his Life but a Dream. How unhappy is that Soul who without the Sen&s;e of Thee has no God, no Hope, no Comfort to &s;upport him? On the contrary, how happy is the Man that &s;earches, &s;ighs and thir&s;ts after Thee? But he only is fully happy, on whom thou lifte&s;t up the Light of Thy Countenance, and who, being conformed to Thee, enjoys in Thy loving Kindne&s;s the Completion of all his De&s;ires. Thou therefore, O my God, art the God of my Life, my Joy and my Hope: <HI>Thou wilt guide me with Thy Coun&s;el, and afterward re|ceive me to Glory: Thou wilt &s;hew me the Path

of Life; in thy Pre&s;ence is Fulne&s;s of Joy, and at thy right Hand there are Plea&s;ures for evermore. Whom then have I in Heaven but Thee? And there is nothing in Earth that I will de&s;ire in Compari&s;on of thee. My Fle&s;h and my Heart faileth: But Thou, O my GOD, art the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is here attempted, is a &s;hort Sy&s;tem of <HI>Ethics</HI> or <HI>Morals</HI> (chiefly for the U&s;e of young Beginners) which have, of late, been called <HI>The Religion of Nature;</HI> by which I would not be under&s;tood to mean a Sy&s;tem of Truths and Du|ties which meer <HI>natural Rea&s;on</HI> would ever, of it|&s;elf, have di&s;covered, in the pre&s;ent Condition of Mankind, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Revelation</HI> or In&s;truction; for it is but a very little of GOD and Religion, or of Truth and Duty, that Man, in his pre&s;ent State, utterly unin&s;tructed, is able to di&s;cover by his meer natural Powers, as the Fact hath abundantly demon&s;trated, where the ancient In&s;tructions were lo&s;t. Nor can it, indeed, be ima|gined, from the Goodne&s;s of GOD, that when he fir&s;t brought Man into Being, a Stranger to every Thing about him, that he would leave him to grope out every Thing that was nece&s;&s;ary, or even expedient, in order to an&s;wer the End of his Being, his true Happine&s;s, without In&s;truction, even in Language and Nature, as well as Religion and Morals; or, that when he had been &s;urprized by a Temptation, and fallen into Sin, that he would leave him to pe|ri&s;h without giving him further In&s;tructions, to be handed down to his Po&s;terity, how he and they &s;hould return to their Duty, and regain His Fa|vour. And that the Fact was accordingly, we are a&s;&s;ured from the mo&s;t ancient Accounts of the fir&s;t Condition of Mankind. What I would therefore be under&s;tood to mean by <HI>Ethics,</HI> or <HI>the Religion of Nature,</HI> is, That Sy&s;tem of Truths and Duties, which, tho' they are not obvious to our weak Rea|&s;on,
<PB N="vi" REF="006859_0131_102AAC072F091788">
without Revelation or In&s;truction, yet when di&s;covered, whether by the one or the other, do evi|dently appear, upon due Con&s;ideration, to be founded in the fir&s;t Principles of Rea&s;on and Nature; in the Nature of GOD and Man, and the various Relations that &s;ub&s;i&s;t between them; and from thence to be capable even of &s;trict Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>WE know there are a great Number of Truths in <HI>Mathematicks</HI> and <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> which not One in Ten Thou&s;and of the Bulk of Mankind would ever have thought of, if it had not been for &s;uch great Men as <HI>Euclid, Apollonius, Archimedes</HI> and Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> &amp;c. which yet may, &s;afely, and with great Advantage, be received upon, their Authority, and be accordingly practi&s;ed upon, by tho&s;e who have not Lei&s;ure or Ability to attend to the Rea&s;ons of them: And now they have led the Way, it is not very difficult for tho&s;e, who are capa|ble of thinking clo&s;ely, to enter into the Demon&s;tra|tions of them: The Ca&s;e is much the &s;ame as to mo|ral Truths and Duties, with regard to the Autho|rity of Prophets and Law-givers. It is the Part of the Prophet or Law-giver, as &s;uch, to di&s;cover Truths, and enjoin Laws, as Rules of Behaviour to the People, who are to receive them upon their Authority, as having but little Lei&s;ure or Capacity to exerci&s;e their Rea&s;on about them, and therefore act rationally in &s;o doing; And it is the Part of the <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> as &s;uch, as far as it is practicable, to enter into the Rea&s;ons and Demon&s;trations, on which tho&s;e Truths and Duties are originally founded.</P>
<P>SUCH a &s;hort Delineation of <HI>Morals,</HI> may, per|haps, be of &s;ome U&s;e, e&s;pecially in the&s;e Times, wherein there is a Sect ari&s;en, or rather revived, that is continually decrying <HI>Morality,</HI> as tho' it were only carnal Rea&s;on, and no Part of <HI>Chri&s;tiani|ty,</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="006859_0132_102AAC099C513CB0">
nor &s;carce con&s;i&s;tent with it: This, it may be pre&s;umed, they would &s;carcely do, if they duly con|&s;idered what <HI>Morality</HI> truly is. And, on the other Hand, as one Extreme is apt to beget another, it is to be feared there may be another Sect ari&s;ing, or gaining Ground, who from too ju&s;t an Indignation at tho&s;e ab&s;urd Notions of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> are in Dan|ger, for want of due Con&s;ideration, of not only &s;et|ting light by <HI>that,</HI> but even of lo&s;ing all &s;erious Sen&s;e of the true Extent and Obligations of <HI>Mora|lity</HI> it&s;elf. It is therefore the De&s;ign of the follow|ing Pages, to endeavour to give a ju&s;t Notion of it, and the Rea&s;ons on which it is founded, and to &s;hew its Extent and va&s;t Importance, and what Con|nection there is between <HI>it</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI></P>
<P>I would only adverti&s;e this one Thing further; That no Speculation or Demon&s;tration what&s;oever, is of any further real U&s;e to us, than &s;o far forth as it directs or engages us in Life and Practice, on which our Happine&s;s all depends. And, as our Rea|&s;on in the&s;e Things, is, at be&s;t, but very dark and weak, it is of the greate&s;t Importance to us, that we diligently &s;tudy the holy Oracles, in which we have the &s;ublime&s;t and mo&s;t advantageous In&s;tructions and Incentives to Practice, with regard to the&s;e Mat|ters, which are of the utmo&s;t Importance to our true and everla&s;ting Happine&s;s. However, as we are rea&s;onable Creatures, and obliged, as &s;uch, to yield unto GOD, the Author of our Beings, a <HI>rea&s;ona|ble Service,</HI> it may be of very good U&s;e for us, as far as it will go, with an implicit Submi&s;&s;ion to Him for the re&s;t, to exerci&s;e our Rea&s;on upon the&s;e great and important Subjects.</P>

AS <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy</HI> is the Know|ledge of the natural World, or the World of Bodies, and the general Laws of the corporeal Nature, to|gether with all tho&s;e practical Matters thereon depending, that promote our comfortable Sub|&s;i&s;tence and Well-being in this pre&s;ent State; &s;o <HI>Moral Philo&s;ophy</HI> is the Knowledge of the moral World; the World of Spirits, or intelligent free Agents, and the general Laws of the moral Na|ture; together with all that practical Conduct and Behaviour thereon depending, that is nece&s;&s;ary to promote our true Happine&s;s, both in our pre&s;ent and future State. And as the <HI>NOETICA</HI> imply all tho&s;e In&s;tructions and Means, that re|late to the Improvement and Conduct of our
<PB N="2" REF="006859_0135_102AAC10F6CD9A20">
Under&s;tandings in Pur&s;uit of the Knowledge of Truth: So the <HI>ETHICA</HI> imply all tho&s;e In|&s;tructions and Means that relate to the Regula|tion and Conduct of our Affections, Actions and Behaviour, in Pur&s;uit of the Enjoyment of our true and chief Good.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE World of intelligent free Agents, in|deed, comprehends the whole Sy&s;tem of created Spirits, both Angels and Men, and whatever other Species there may be, con&s;idered as being derived from, and under the Conduct and Go|vernment of Almighty GOD, the Author, the Father and Lord of all. But what I mean chiefly to in&s;i&s;t upon, is, the <HI>Knowledge of our&s;elves,</HI> as we are <HI>Men,</HI> or a moral Sy&s;tem of rational Ani|mals, in all the Relations wherein we &s;tand, both with regard to GOD, our&s;elves, and one ano|ther, with a Behaviour &s;uitable thereunto (without con&s;idering us particularly either in our <HI>oeconomical</HI> or <HI>political</HI> Capacities) which is the Foundation of all the re&s;t, and is u&s;ually termed <HI>Ethics.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>ETHICS</HI> is the Art of living happily, by the right Knowledge of our&s;elves, and the Practice of Virtue: Our <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> being the End, and <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> the Means to that End.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE are &s;aid to live happily when we en|joy our&s;elves, and all that is really good for us, in the whole of our Nature and Duration; <HI>i. e.</HI> con&s;idered, not only as &s;en&s;itive, but as rea&s;ona|ble, free, active, &s;ocial and immortal Creatures. For <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> means that Plea&s;ure which ari&s;eth in us from our Enjoyment of our&s;elves, and all that is really good for us, or &s;uitable to our Natures, and conducive to our Happine&s;s in the whole.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="3" REF="006859_0136_102AAC1562391BC0">5. THE Enjoyment of our&s;elves, and all that is truly good, depends on a good Habit, or State of the Soul, united with, and delighting in its proper Objects, which are <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good;</HI> the fir&s;t being the Object of the Under&s;tanding, and the other of the Will and Affections: And this good Habit is the &s;ame Thing with <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>VIRTUE</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in that Integrity, Firmne&s;s and Stability of the Soul, whereby we do hone&s;tly and &s;tedfa&s;tly per&s;i&s;t, in &s;pite of all Temptations to the contrary, in the Love and Practice of <HI>moral Good,</HI> and the Hatred and For|bearance of <HI>moral Evil: Vice</HI> is the contrary.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>MORAL Good</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in freely chu&s;ing and doing what&s;oever Truth and right Rea&s;on dictate as nece&s;&s;ary to be cho&s;en and done, in order to our true Happine&s;s: <HI>Moral Evil</HI> the contrary; for moral Good mu&s;t mean, the Good of a moral Agent; <HI>i. e.</HI> of rational, con&s;cious, free, &s;elf-exerting and &s;elf-determining Agent.</P>
<P N="8">8. THERE are two Things nece&s;&s;ary to be con|&s;idered, with re&s;pect to the Nature of <HI>moral Good: viz.</HI> The <HI>Criterion,</HI> or Te&s;t, by which, in the right U&s;e of our Rea&s;on, we determine what we ought to do, or forbear; and the <HI>Obli|gations</HI> we thereupon find our&s;elves under to the Practice of it.</P>
<P N="9">9. (I.) THE <HI>Criterion</HI> or Te&s;t, whereby we determine what we ought to do or forbear, or what tho&s;e Actions and Forbearances are, which are to be cho&s;en and done, is the <HI>natural Good</HI> of them, or that Plea&s;ure and Happine&s;s in the whole of our Nature and Duration, which natu|rally attends them: For we find by Experience, that &s;ome Things, Affections and Actions, are, in the very Nature of them, attended with Plea&s;ure
<PB N="4" REF="006859_0137_102AAC17CCF6DCE8">
or Happine&s;s, either to the Mind, as perceptive of Truth, or to the Will and Affections, as de|&s;irous of Good; and others with Pain or Mi&s;ery, in re&s;pect to the one or the other. In &s;ome we have a quick Sen&s;e of the Decent and Amiable, which delight the Mind; and in others, of the Deformed and Odious, which di&s;plea&s;e it: In &s;ome we perceive the Advantage, in others the Mi&s;chief attending them, to our&s;elves or others; and accordingly, the former are attended with inward Tranquility, Acquie&s;cence, and Self-ap|probation, and the latter with Anxiety, Remor&s;e, and Self-reproach. And as Ea&s;e, Plea&s;ure or <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> is what we call <HI>natural Good;</HI> &s;o Un|ea&s;ine&s;s, Pain or <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI> we call <HI>natural Evil.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. BUT in order to make a right Judgment of <HI>natural Good</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> as being the Te&s;t of <HI>moral,</HI> we mu&s;t (as I &s;aid) take into the Account, the <HI>whole of our Nature and Duration,</HI> as being <HI>&s;en&s;itive</HI> and <HI>rational, &s;ocial</HI> and <HI>immortal</HI> Creatures. It mu&s;t therefore be the Good and Happine&s;s of the <HI>whole human Nature,</HI> and the <HI>whole moral Sy&s;tem,</HI> in <HI>Time,</HI> and to all <HI>Eternity.</HI> Hence the Good of the <HI>animal Body,</HI> or the <HI>Plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e,</HI> is but imaginary, and cea&s;eth to be <HI>Good,</HI> and hath even the Nature of <HI>Evil,</HI> &s;o far forth as it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Good and Happine&s;s of the <HI>Soul:</HI> Which is al&s;o the Ca&s;e of <HI>private Good,</HI> &s;o far forth as it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>Publick;</HI> and <HI>temporal Good,</HI> &s;o far forth as it is incon&s;i&s;tent with that which is <HI>eter|nal.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. AND this our <HI>Good</HI> and Happine&s;s in the whole, does nece&s;&s;arily coincide with, and even re&s;ult from, the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of Things, or Things, Affections and Actions, con&s;idered as
<PB N="5" REF="006859_0138_102AAC1954083450">
being what they really are;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Clarke,</HI> and <HI>Wolla&s;ton.</HI></NOTE> for thus to con&s;ider them, is the &s;ame Thing with con&s;idering them as being <HI>fit,</HI> and tending, in the <HI>Nature</HI> of them, to render our rational, &s;ocial and immortal <HI>Na|ture,</HI> in the whole ultimately happy: And &s;uch Affections and Actions, corre&s;pondent to &s;uch Natures and Characters, mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily and eternally fit; it being impo&s;&s;ible to conceive of &s;uch Natures and Relations, but &s;uch moral Af|fections and Actions will re&s;ult as <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> and the contrary, as <HI>unfit</HI> and <HI>wrong.</HI> So that the <HI>general Good</HI> of the whole, the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Fitne&s;s</HI> of Things, and <HI>the Truth</HI> of Things, or Things con&s;idered as being what they are, are, as I apprehend, really coincident, and do, in Effect, come to the &s;ame Thing, in &s;ettling the Criterion of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong,</HI> or the Te&s;t whereby we mu&s;t determine what we are to chu&s;e or avoid, and to do or forbear.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>MORAL Good</HI> mu&s;t therefore con&s;i&s;t in freely chu&s;ing and acting conformable to the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Things;</HI> or to Things, Af|fections and Actions, con&s;idered as being what <HI>they</HI> really are, <HI>i. e.</HI> as tending, or not tending to our true Happine&s;s, as being what <HI>we</HI> really are: Or (which is the &s;ame Thing) in chu&s;ing and acting according to the <HI>Fitne&s;s of Things,</HI> or to Things, Affections and Actions, con&s;idered as fit or &s;ub&s;ervient, in their own Nature, to pro|mote our be&s;t <HI>Good</HI> and Happine&s;s <HI>in the whole.</HI> And this again is the &s;ame Thing with acting ac|cording to <HI>right Rea&s;on</HI> (which has been &s;ome|times called the <HI>Criterion</HI>) it being by the right U&s;e of our Rea&s;on that we apprehend. Things

as being what they really are, and di&s;cover which tho&s;e Things, Affections and Actions are, that do, in the Nature of them, tend to our true Happine&s;s in the whole; and thereby judge what we mu&s;t do and avoid, and form Rules by which we mu&s;t act in all our Conduct and Behaviour, &s;o as to be truly happy.</P>
<P N="13">13. (II.) THE <HI>Obligation</HI> we are under, as moral Agents, to practi&s;e accordingly, implieth &s;ome <HI>Law,</HI> binding us, under certain Penalties, to &s;uch Actions as are morally Good, and to forbear the contrary; and this con&s;titutes the Notions of <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Sin,</HI> and is two-fold, <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Inter|nal,</HI> or <HI>External</HI> and <HI>Moral.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. (I.) THE <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>internal</HI> Obligation to the Practice of moral Virtue ari&s;eth from the <HI>Law</HI> of our <HI>Nature,</HI> or that Law which GOD hath e&s;tabli&s;hed within our own Brea&s;ts, and in the Frame of our Nature. And this is the Law of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> together with the Law of <HI>Self-love,</HI> and <HI>Self-pre&s;ervation,</HI> and the Law of <HI>Benevolence.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. (1.) THE Law of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> is, I think, the &s;ame Thing which &s;ome have called the <HI>moral Sen&s;e,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Shaft&s;bury, Hutch<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">on,</HI> and <HI>Preceptor&punc;</HI> or <HI>Turnbull.</HI></NOTE> being a kind of quick and almo&s;t intuitive Sen&s;e of Right and Wrong, deriving, as I conceive, from the perpetual Pre|&s;ence and Irradiation of the Deity in our Minds, and dictating with a &s;trong and commanding Force what is rea&s;onable, fair and decent, and &s;o fit and right to be done, and giving us Applau&s;e and Satisfaction when we conform to it, and blaming and reproaching us, and filling us with Unea&s;ine&s;s and Remor&s;e, when we act contrary
<PB N="7" REF="006859_0140_102AAC1D5C699710">
to its Dictates: It being the Law of our Nature, that we &s;hould always affect and act conformable to the inward Sen&s;e of our own Minds and Con|&s;ciences. And tho&s;e con&s;equent plea&s;ing or un|ea&s;y Sentiments, con&s;idering it as a Law, are its Sanctions.</P>
<P N="16">16. (2.) THE Law of <HI>Self-love</HI> and <HI>Self-pre|&s;ervation,</HI> which makes us &s;olicitous for the Con|tinuance of our Exi&s;tence, and the Enjoyment of our&s;elves, and ari&s;eth from the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our Exi&s;tence, and of Plea&s;ure or Pain, natural|ly attending, certain Conditions in which we are, or maybe, or the contrary; which therefore are its Sanctions. For it is manife&s;t that we are, by the Author of our Nature, laid under a Nece&s;&s;ity of valuing our&s;elves and our own <HI>In|tere&s;t,</HI> and of &s;eeking and pur&s;uing our own <HI>Pre|&s;ervation</HI> and <HI>Well-being</HI> or Happine&s;s, and what|ever we find tends to it, or is connected with it; and con&s;equently that of the Society to which we belong, with which we find our own is, in the Nature of Things, nece&s;&s;arily connected.</P>
<P N="17">17. FROM whence ari&s;eth (thirdly) the Law of <HI>Benevolence,</HI> or that Di&s;po&s;ition we find al&s;o implanted in us towards the Good of others, a|ri&s;ing from Reflection, whereby we are led to put our&s;elves in each other's Stead, and to have a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure or Unea&s;ine&s;s in the good or ill Condition of others, from a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own, in the like Situation; which Sentiments therefore are its Sanctions. This Principle makes us de&s;irous of each other's E&s;teem and Good-will, and puts us upon doing what we know may be plea&s;ing and advantageous to each other, and to the whole; &s;o that <HI>&s;elf</HI> and <HI>&s;ocial Good</HI> can|not
<PB N="8" REF="006859_0141_102AAC1FADDD2E30" MS="y">
be con&s;idered in them&s;elves, as at all interfer|ing, but as being intirely coincident and &s;ub&s;er|vient to each other.</P>
<P N="18">18. BUT while we re&s;t here, and act upon no other Views or Motives than the&s;e <HI>Laws of our Nature</HI> &s;ugge&s;t, without con&s;idering them as being the Laws or the GOD (or the Author) of Nature; though what we do, may be &s;aid, according to the common Acceptation, to be meerly <HI>morally good</HI> or <HI>evil,</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> or <HI>vicious;</HI> yet there will be nothing in it (however firm and &s;table our Con|duct be) that can properly be called <HI>Religion,</HI> which mu&s;t ever enter into the ju&s;t and complete Notion of <HI>Morality;</HI> for this mu&s;t be under&s;tood to comprehend every Thing that can either direct or influence our moral Behaviour, and con&s;e|quently mu&s;t con&s;ider us in all the Relations wherein we &s;tand, not only to our&s;elves and one another, but, above all, to the great Author of our Being, on whom we do intirely depend, and to whom we are therefore, in all Rea&s;on, ac|countable.</P>
<P N="19">19. (II.) The <HI>external</HI> and <HI>moral Obligation</HI> we are under to tho&s;e Actions and Forbearances above-mentioned, ari&s;eth from <HI>moral Government,</HI> or the Con&s;ideration that they are the Will and Law of a Superior who aims at our Happine&s;s in enjoying them, to whom we are therefore ac|countable for our Behaviour, and by whom we &s;hall be rewarded or puni&s;hed; <HI>i. e.</HI> made to feel Plea&s;ure or Pain, according as we behave well or ill (which are its Sanctions:) So that this Obli|gation takes its Force from the former, and this is two-fold, <HI>political</HI> and <HI>religious.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. (1.) THE <HI>political Obligation</HI> to the Prac|tice
<PB N="9" REF="006859_0142_102AAC2205A92478" MS="y">
of the&s;e moral Actions and Forbearances, is the Con&s;ideration that they are the publick Will, or the Will and <HI>Law of the Society</HI> or Govern|ment we live under, and to which we are ac|countable (whether indeed it be a <HI>Family</HI> or a <HI>State</HI>) enforced by the Sanctions of temporal Re|wards and Puni&s;hments. In this View <HI>moral Laws</HI> become <HI>political Laws,</HI> and <HI>moral Good, po|litical Good,</HI> to which many others might be add|ed, for promoting of the publick Weal.</P>
<P N="21">21. BUT here again, tho' GOD is the Founder of Government, both oeconomical and political, yet while we re&s;t on this Foot, and act meerly under the&s;e political Views, and with a Regard only to our Intere&s;t in this World, tho' we may be &s;aid to be meer <HI>moral Men</HI> (as that Expre&s;&s;ion is commonly u&s;ed) or <HI>good Citizens,</HI> and <HI>good Common-wealth&s;men,</HI> we cannot be &s;aid to be <HI>religious,</HI> no, not even in tho&s;e Actions that relate to GOD him&s;elf. But,</P>
<P N="22">22. (2.) THE <HI>religious Obligation</HI> we are un|der to tho&s;e Actions and Forbearances that are nece&s;&s;ary to our Happine&s;s in the whole, is the Con&s;ideration that they are the Will and <HI>Law of GOD,</HI> our Creator, Pre&s;erver, and &s;upreme mo|ral Governor, the great Author, Head and Lord of the whole &s;ocial Sy&s;tem, enforced by the Sanctions of <HI>eternal Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments,</HI> to whom we are ju&s;tly accountable for all our Be|haviour, and by whom we mu&s;t expect to be treated well or ill, according as that &s;hall be found to be good or bad.</P>
<P N="23">23. FOR it will appear hereafter, that they mu&s;t be the Will and Law of GOD concerning us, becau&s;e He being perfectly happy, and Self-&s;uffi|cient
<PB N="10" REF="006859_0143_102AAC2596C34540">
to his own Happine&s;s, cannot aim at any Advantage to him&s;elf, in giving us Being, or in a|ny of his Di&s;pen&s;ations towards us; and con&s;equent|ly, that his great End mu&s;t be our Happine&s;s; and that this he will con&s;ider as <HI>his</HI> Intere&s;t, his De|light and Glory, that his rational Creatures be in the whole, a happy Sy&s;tem, by doing what is fit and right upon all Occa&s;ions. It being there|fore his Aim that we be happy, what&s;oever does, in the Nature of it, and according to the Con|&s;titution which he hath made, tend to his Ho|nour and our true Happine&s;s, as being therefore fit and right, mu&s;t be his <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> concern|ing us, and con&s;equently our <HI>Duty,</HI> and what is contrary thereto, mu&s;t be <HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. THAT, therefore, which con&s;titutes the Nature of <HI>Religion,</HI> and denominates our Actions and Behaviour <HI>religious,</HI> and makes <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Morality,</HI> in the complete Notion of it, coinci|dent, is, That we forbear what&s;oever tends to our Mi&s;ery, and do every Thing that tends to our Happine&s;s in the whole, in Obedience to the Will of GOD, and from a Sen&s;e of Duty to Him, and in View of his All-&s;eeing Eye, and the Account we are to give of our&s;elves to Him.</P>
<P N="25">25. SO that upon the whole it appears, That <HI>Morality,</HI> in the ju&s;t Extent of it, is the &s;ame Thing with the <HI>Religion of Nature,</HI> or that <HI>Re|ligion</HI> which is founded in the <HI>Nature</HI> of Things; and that it may be defined, <HI>the Pur&s;uit of our true Happine&s;s by Thinking, Affecting and Acting, according to the Laws of Truth and right Rea&s;on, under a Sen&s;e of the Duty that we owe to Almighty GOD, and the Account we mu&s;t expect to give of our&s;elves to Him.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Crou&s;az</HI>'s <HI>Art of Thinking,</HI> Page 60.

They appear to have no Notion of any Thing but the Objects of Sen&s;e, can conceive nothing of Duty and Sin, and &s;eem capable of no Enjoyment of any Thing but Meat and Drink, and the Means of continu|ing their Species, and defending them&s;elves; and the&s;e only are the Things to which their Exertions and Activity tend.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. WITH Regard to the&s;e, they have, in|deed, a wonderful Sagacity, and what looks like Rea&s;oning, De&s;ign and Contrivance, and a &s;ocial Tendency; but the&s;e do not &s;eem to be any Thing of their own, becau&s;e they have them ori|ginally, and do not acquire them by Teaching, Trial and Indu&s;try. This Sagacity therefore &s;eems to be what we call an <HI>In&s;tinct;</HI> by which Word, nothing el&s;e can be meant, but that they are rather pa&s;&s;ively acted and conducted by &s;ome other Being; &s;ome governing Mind on whom they depend, according to certain Laws of Na|ture which He hath e&s;tabli&s;hed, than that they act

from any Principle of Deliberation and De&s;ign within them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. THESE Sen&s;ations, Appetites and Exer|tions, indeed, I find I have in common with them; but then I am con&s;cious of va&s;tly nobler Powers and Faculties than the&s;e. For I find I can <HI>reflect</HI> and look into my own Mind, and con&s;ider my|&s;elf and my own Powers and Actions, and their Objects: I can attend to the Light of the <HI>pure Intellect,</HI> and <HI>compare</HI> one Thing with another, and ob&s;erve their &s;everal <HI>Relations,</HI> and ab&s;tract and give general Names. I can <HI>judge</HI> of True and Fal&s;e, and of Right and Wrong, and deli|berate and weigh Things, and <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and infer one Thing from another, and reduce them into <HI>Me|thod</HI> and Order, according to their various Con|nections and Dependences. I can <HI>excite</HI> Imagi|nations and Conceptions of Things pa&s;t or ab&s;ent, and recollect them in my Mind at Plea&s;ure, and reject or <HI>keep</HI> them under my Con&s;ideration as I plea&s;e, at lea&s;t in a good Mea&s;ure, and am at <HI>Liberty</HI> to &s;u&s;pend judging till I have carefully ex|amined them, and to <HI>act,</HI> or not to act, in Con&s;e|quence of my Deliberations, as I think fit. In the Impre&s;&s;ions of Sen&s;e indeed, and the Perceptions of Evidence, I am pa&s;&s;ive, but in all the&s;e I am evidently active, and can chu&s;e or refu&s;e, will or nill, act or forbear, from a Principle of Self-ex|ertion; which are all truly great and noble Pow|ers.</P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. I CAN, moreover, in Con&s;equence of the&s;e Abilities, contrive and project <HI>Ends</HI> and <HI>Means,</HI> and Rea&s;ons of acting, and <HI>Rules</HI> to act by, and fore&s;ee much of the Events of my Con|duct. I can give <HI>Laws,</HI> and propo&s;e Motives to my&s;elf or others, and exact an Account of

my&s;elf or them, and give an Account to my&s;elf or others, whether I or they do, or do not act according to tho&s;e Laws. And I find, that as I <HI>love</HI> or <HI>hate</HI> Things according as they are agreea|ble or di&s;agreeable to me; &s;o I have <HI>Hopes</HI> or <HI>Fears, Joys</HI> or <HI>Griefs,</HI> according as I feel, or have in View, Plea&s;ures or Pains, and am <HI>con&s;cious</HI> of having done well or ill, and that my own <HI>Con|&s;cience</HI> will not fail to <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> and <HI>applaud,</HI> or <HI>ac|cu&s;e</HI> and <HI>condemn</HI> me accordingly; and as I feel great <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in having done what I apprehend to be right, &s;o I feel no le&s;s <HI>Shame, Horror,</HI> and <HI>Remor&s;e,</HI> when I have done what is wrong.</P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. FROM hence I not only know that I have a Being, but al&s;o that when I am in tole|rable Circum&s;tances, and do well, I have a great Enjoyment of that Being; that it is very dear to me, and that I am, above all Things, concerned to pre&s;erve and continue it, and to make it as com|fortable and happy as ever I can; and am there|fore de&s;irous to acquire and enjoy all the Means and Accommodations, the Goods of the Mind, Body or Fortune, that are nece&s;&s;ary and conve|nient for that Purpo&s;e; which I have al&s;o a great Value for, in Proportion to their Sub&s;erviency to that End, and am very <HI>fearful</HI> of being deprived, and very apt to be <HI>di&s;plea&s;ed</HI> or feel Re&s;entment at any One that would deprive me of them, and <HI>grateful</HI> to any One that does any Thing towards furni&s;hing me with them, or &s;ecuring them to me.

AND as I can look back and remem|ber what I have been knowing to in my Time; &s;o I can imagine a Time when I was not, and con|ceive a Notion of a great Number of Ages and Tran&s;actions before me, and of an endle&s;s Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Ages and Tran&s;actions to come. And I cannot only conceive that I may, but cannot refrain from being earne&s;tly de&s;irous, in &s;ome Condition or other, to bear a Part in them, and to enjoy my&s;elf happily through all imaginable Periods of Duration: So that though I know there mu&s;t have been a Time when I began to be, yet I am &s;olicitous that I may never cea&s;e to be, and to enjoy my&s;elf; and cannot avoid having Hopes of this, even after Death, &s;ince this Life turns to but little Account. All the&s;e are &s;o many Facts, and I am con&s;cious and intuitively certain of them, if I look carefully within my|&s;elf.

<P N="10">&sect; 10.

So that it is manife&s;t from their Depend|ence and Sub&s;erviency, that they are contrived and de&s;igned to con&s;titute, as in Fact they do, one harmonious, beautiful and u&s;eful Sy&s;tem; one complete and intire Whole; in which I find every Thing fitted, in the be&s;t Manner, to my own Conveniencies and Plea&s;ures, both for the com|fortable Sub&s;i&s;tence of my Body, and the En|tertainment and Delight of my Soul; but &s;o, that it was, at the &s;ame time, the manife&s;t De|&s;ign of them to excite, engage, direct and em|ploy my Activity, without which I find I cannot comfortably enjoy either my&s;elf or them.</P>

I CAN moreover carry my Thoughts and Imaginations throughout the va&s;t Spaces of Heaven and Earth, and have a mighty Curio&s;ity to pry and &s;earch out the Secrets and Laws of Na|ture, and di&s;cover and conceive, as much as I can, of the great Author of it, and what Sort of Behaviour and Conduct is &s;uitable to my Na|ture, and the Relation I &s;tand in to Him and my Fellow Creatures, as tending to make me and them happy, and as &s;uch, mu&s;t be amiable, and

Of which, as I know there are a great Number of my own Kind, &s;o I cannot rea&s;ona|bly doubt but there are others of various Orders above me, which may probably have other and nobler Sen&s;es than tho&s;e five narrow Inlets that I am acquainted with, and confined to, and far greater and nobler Abilities, both of Under&s;tand|ing and Activity, than I am furni&s;hed with. Such I can ea&s;ily conceive to be po&s;&s;ible; and, from the various Gradations in Perfection of Being, in the &s;everal Tribes below me, it is very probable there may be the like Gradations in &s;everal Tribes of Beings above me.</P>
<P N="13">&sect; 13. As to tho&s;e of my own Species (from which by Analogy I may form &s;ome Notion of them) I find we were evidently made for Society, being furni&s;hed with the Power of <HI>Speech</HI> as well as <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> whereby we are capable of entering into the Under&s;tanding of each other's Minds and Sentiments, and of holding mutual Inter|cour&s;e and Conver&s;ation one with another, and jointly con&s;piring to promote our common Well-being; to which we are naturally led by a Prin|ciple of <HI>Benevolence,</HI> and <HI>&s;ocial Di&s;po&s;itions</HI> and <HI>Affections,</HI> &s;ounded in the Frame and Condition of our Nature, which not only placeth us in the various Relations of <HI>Hu&s;bands</HI> and <HI>Wives, Parents</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> and other <HI>Relatives;</HI> but al&s;o lays us under a Nece&s;&s;ity of mutual Dependence one upon another, which obligeth us to enter into Compacts

for our Defence and Safety, and for maintaining both private Right and publick Order, and pro|moting the common Good of our Species, in the &s;everal Communities to which we belong. And as I have a quick Sen&s;e of what is right in others towards me as being what I am, and of my own Ea&s;e and Comfort, &s;o I cannot dive&s;t my&s;elf of a Sen&s;e of what mu&s;t, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, be right in me towards others, and a Sen&s;e of Ten|derne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e that are in Mi|&s;ery, whereby I am &s;trongly prompted to relieve them: And the&s;e Tendencies and Affections of <HI>the &s;ocial Kind,</HI> are evidently planted in us for pro|moting our &s;ocial Happine&s;s. And finally; as I cannot long enjoy my&s;elf in a State of Solitude, and have a &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion for Society; &s;o I find, in Fact, that my true Intere&s;t and Enjoyment of my&s;elf, depends on the general Intere&s;t and good Order of the Community, and this, in Addition to tho&s;e &s;ocial Di&s;po&s;itions, &s;trongly prompts me to the Love of my Country, and to be forward and active in whatever may promote the publick Weal.

I cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t my&s;elf a Moment in Ea&s;e or Ex|i&s;tence, nor add one Power or Faculty to tho&s;e I have: And there are certain Bounds (&s;mall compared with what I can ea&s;ily imagine) be|yond which I cannot at all extend or exert them.

<P N="2">&sect; 2. I KNOW that I have a Being, becau&s;e I perceive and act, and that I mu&s;t have had a Beginning of Exi&s;tence, becau&s;e there mu&s;t have been a Time when I did not perceive or act, and
<PB N="23" REF="006859_0156_102AAC43A8CE78E0">
I can have no Notion of the Exi&s;tence of an intel|ligent active Being, without con&s;cious Perception and Activity. And if I began to be, I mu&s;t have been made. It is certain I could not come into Being by meer <HI>Chance,</HI> for that is nothing but an empty Name, which we vulgarly u&s;e only as a Cover to our Ignorance or Inadvertence. I al&s;o know I did not make my&s;elf, for that is im|po&s;&s;ible, and would imply, to be, and not to be, at the &s;ame Time; nor have I Power to con|tinue my&s;elf in Being &s;o much as one Moment; nor can I a Moment &s;ecure my Health, or any of my Enjoyments (Part I. Chap. I. &sect; 14.) &s;o that I find I am wholly a limited and dependent Being.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. IT is therefore certain, that I mu&s;t have had a Cau&s;e; for an Effect, or Thing made, with|out a Cau&s;e, is a Contradiction, and can have no Meaning: There mu&s;t then be &s;ome other Being on whom I depend. And &s;ince <HI>there cannot be an Effect without a Cau&s;e,</HI> it is evident that the Cau&s;e of my Being mu&s;t have Powers capable of pro|ducing &s;uch an Effect; otherwi&s;e there would &s;till be an Effect without a Cau&s;e, than which nothing can be more ab&s;urd. It is evident that my Pa|rents could not be the adequate Cau&s;es; they could, at mo&s;t, be only the Occa&s;ions or In&s;tru|ments of my Being; for it never was in their Power that I &s;hould be at all, or being, that I &s;hould be &s;uch as I am; nor could they continue me a Moment in Being, Health or Ea&s;e. It is therefore plain that I mu&s;t look higher for an adequate Cau&s;e, both of my Exi&s;tence and Sub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. IT is moreover manife&s;t, that <HI>no Cau&s;e can give what it hath not,</HI> or, which is the &s;ame Thing, produce an Effect more noble, or of
<PB N="24" REF="006859_0157_102AAC46213918B0">
greater Powers or Perfections than it&s;elf; for then again, there would be an Effect without a Cau&s;e, or Something produced by Nothing, which is impo&s;&s;ible. Hence, therefore, it is plain, that what is de&s;titute of Perception, Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and Intelligence, cannot produce a perceptive, con|&s;cious, intelligent Being: What is void of any Principle of Deliberation, Liberty and Activity, cannot produce a con&s;iderate, free, active Being, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is con&s;equently evident, that the Being who brought me into Being, mu&s;t him&s;elf be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Powers or Perfections analogous to tho&s;e I experience in my&s;elf.</P>

I. &sect; 5, 6.) It is from hence evident, that the Almighty Being, who made me, and whom I call GOD, being the genuine and ade|quate Cau&s;e, from whom I derived, and on whom I depend, mu&s;t Him&s;elf have <HI>Under&s;tand|ing, Knowledge, Will, Force,</HI> and <HI>Activity;</HI> mu&s;t have <HI>Liberty, Choice, Deliberation, Self-exertion,</HI> and <HI>Self-determination;</HI> and mu&s;t be a Being of <HI>Equity, Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> and all other moral Perfections, which are implied in the&s;e, and which are comprehended under the Terms <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Rectitude.</HI> And as I am thus truly made by Him, and in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to re&s;emble Him, He mu&s;t therefore be &s;trictly and properly my <HI>Pa|rent,</HI> or the <HI>Father of my Spirit.</HI></P>

From whence it is evident, that this univer&s;al Cau&s;e mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the highe&s;t Perfections and Powers that are conceivable, or do at all obtain, and that he mu&s;t hold them entirely independent of any other Being what&s;oever: And, being independent of any other Being, it is evident, that He cannot be under the Power of any other Being to limit or controul Him, and that all other Beings mu&s;t be entirely dependent upon Him, and con&s;equently mu&s;t have derived from his Will and Power, and there|fore be limited to various Degrees of Being and Perfection, as plea&s;eth Him.

THAT I was not made at all Adventures, without any Contrivance and De&s;ign, but mu&s;t have been made for &s;ome End or other, I cannot doubt, &s;ince I have evidently found, that He who gave me my Being, mu&s;t Him&s;elf be a Being of all po&s;&s;ible Perfections, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be a mo&s;t kind, wi&s;e and de&s;igning Cau&s;e; e&s;pecially &s;ince I do al&s;o evidently find in Fact, &s;o many, and &s;uch manife&s;t Tokens of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t benevolent De&s;ign and Contrivance in my whole Frame, and in every Thing about me (Chap.

<P N="3">&sect; 3. BEING therefore made by a mo&s;t wi&s;e and good Cau&s;e, I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been made for &s;ome wi&s;e and good End. And having demon&s;trated that the Being who made me, hath

an infinite Sufficiency within Him&s;elf for His own Happine&s;s, independent of any other Being (Chap. II. &sect; 18.) it is manife&s;t that whatever good End He had in giving me my Being, it could not be to &s;erve Him&s;elf of me, or to promote any Ad|vantage to Him&s;elf by me: This were a Thought infinitely too mean to entertain of Him, who is <HI>GOD, All-&s;ufficient,</HI> that it could be po&s;&s;ible for Him to &s;tand in need of me, or of any Thing I could do or &s;uffer, in order to His own Hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. MOREOVER, &s;ince it hath been evidently di&s;covered that the Author of my Being is infi|nitely perfect, and con&s;equently perfectly ju&s;t and good; perfectly equitable and benevolent (Chap. II. &sect; 6, 17.) it is evident that He could not give me my Being with any malevolent De&s;ign, or with a De&s;ign that I &s;hould be ab&s;olutely and un|avoidably mi&s;erable in the Whole; nor could He (as I humbly conceive) de&s;ign Mi&s;ery for me, or any of His Creatures, but in Con&s;equence of their per&s;onal, voluntary Demerit, by per&s;i&s;ting in wilful Rebellion again&s;t Him, or the general Intere&s;t of the Con&s;titution which He hath made; for this would be &s;o far from con&s;i&s;ting with E|quity and Benevolence, that it would imply the very Notion of Cruelty. A Thought which we &s;hould remove at an infinite Di&s;tance from that mo&s;t perfect and be&s;t of Beings.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. INDEED, in ca&s;e of wilful Rebellion, fi|nally per&s;i&s;ted in, it is fit and right, and even ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Good of the Whole (being the mo&s;t effectual Means to cure Rebellion, and &s;ecure the Obedience of GOD's Creatures, which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for their general Good and Happine&s;s) that Puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted upon tho&s;e

that rebel, and ob&s;tinately oppo&s;e their Wills to the Con&s;titution He hath made, and the Ends of His Government, in Proportion to their &s;everal Crimes and Mi&s;demeanors (Chap. II. &sect; 19.) And indeed Mi&s;chief and Mi&s;ery do, in the Nature of Things, nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from Sin and Vice. But it can|not be therefore &s;uppo&s;ed that their Mi&s;ery could be His primary De&s;ign, or that He &s;hould intend their Rebellion, or lay them under a Nece&s;&s;ity of Sinning, that they might be finally mi&s;erable; for this would, in Effect, be ab&s;olutely to de&s;ign their Mi&s;ery, and delight in it as &s;uch, which to Him mu&s;t be infinitely impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. ON the contrary, &s;ince GOD is evi|dently a mo&s;t kind and benevolent Being, and could therefore have no other than kind and benevolent Ends, in giving Being to His rational Creatures, it is plain that His primary Intention mu&s;t have been &s;o far from that of making them to be mi&s;erable, that He did undoubtedly make them with a De&s;ign that they might be, in &s;ome good Degree, happy, in the Participation and Enjoyment of His Goodne&s;s, in Proportion to their &s;everal Capacities and Qualifications. And that this was, in Fact, His End, is al&s;o manife&s;t from the Frame and Structure of the Nature which He hath given them; for He hath given them Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, whereby they are capable of Self-enjoyment; Intelligence, whereby they are able to con&s;ider and judge of what is fit and needful to the Enjoyment of them&s;elves; Pa&s;&s;ions, whereby they are prompted to de&s;ire and endea|vour what contributes to their Well-being, and to guard and defend them&s;elves again&s;t what may be hurtful to them; and a Principle of Activity, to procure the one, and avoid the other; and of Liberty, whereby they are able to &s;u&s;pend Judg|ing
<PB N="43" REF="006859_0176_102AAC77F34CC830">
and Acting, till they can duly ballance their Pa&s;&s;ions, and act with Advantage. And be&s;ides the&s;e Powers, which are Means to their per&s;onal Happine&s;s, He hath al&s;o in&s;pired them with &s;o|cial Affections, which render them capable of &s;o|cial Happine&s;s: Having therefore given them the Means, it is plain He mu&s;t have de&s;igned the End. (Chap. I. &sect; 5, 7, 13.)</P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. THIS then being the Frame of that Na|ture, which GOD hath given us, it mu&s;t plainly be His De&s;ign that we &s;hould &s;eek our Happine&s;s, in affecting and acting conformable to it; other|wi&s;e, if we act incon&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves, and &s;o do a Violence to our own Nature; in this Ca&s;e, we can neither enjoy our&s;elves, nor any Thing el&s;e, and &s;o mu&s;t be unavoidably mi&s;erable. In|a&s;much therefore as GOD hath made us to be intelligent, free, active Creatures; and &s;ince our Happine&s;s mu&s;t immediately depend upon the right U&s;e of the&s;e Powers, and mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the free and vigorous Exertion of them, in Con|formity to the great Law of our Nature, which is the inward Sen&s;e of our own Rea&s;on and Con|&s;ciences; it mu&s;t accordingly be His De&s;ign, not only that we &s;hould be happy, but that we &s;hould be &s;o by Means of our own Activity, and by our always freely acting rea&s;onably, and con&s;equently that we &s;hould cultivate and improve our Rea&s;on in the be&s;t Manner we can, under the Circum&s;tances in which He hath placed us, in order to make a right Judgment how we ought to affect and act, and conduct our&s;elves to the be&s;t Advantage for our own Happine&s;s.</P>

But it would be a mo&s;t un|worthy Thought of Him, to imagine that he made us for the Sake of being applauded, or that He requireth even the&s;e ju&s;t Acknowledgments for His own Sake, as though we, or our Services, could be any Advantage to Him. This would be to make Him a mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h Being indeed; e&s;pecially if we &s;hould imagine that He could aim at Applau&s;e or Glory, at the Expence of our unavoidable and endle&s;s Mi&s;ery: This would be a mo&s;t di&s;honourable and &s;hocking Thought.</P>
<P N="9">&sect; 9. SO far from this, that I mu&s;t conceive it to be the Glory of GOD to communicate His Perfections in various Degrees, &s;o far as they are communicable, and to di&s;play His Goodne&s;s to His Creatures, and make them happy in the Par|ticipation of it, in Proportion to their &s;everal Capacities, and this in Con&s;equence of their act|ing in Obedience to Him, and in Conformity to His Law, which is the Law of their Natures. For &s;ince He was plea&s;ed to give them their Be|ing, it cannot be but that, as the tender Father of His own Off-&s;pring, He will account it His In|tere&s;t

<P N="10">&sect; 10. FOR &s;ince He that wills the End, mu&s;t will the Means nece&s;&s;ary to that End, it is plain that &s;ince GOD wills our Happine&s;s in the Whole, as our End, and his Glory, it mu&s;t be his Will and Law concerning us, that we avoid every Thing that doth, in the Nature of it, tend to make us mi&s;erable, and that we do every Thing that doth, in the Nature of it, tend to make us happy (<HI>Introd.</HI> 23.) So that the Glo|ry of GOD, and our Happine&s;s, with the Means nece&s;&s;ary to it, and his Di&s;honour, and our Mi&s;ery, with the Means which tend to that, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be coincident, and come in Ef|fect to one and the &s;ame Thing.</P>
<P N="11">&sect; 11. AND &s;ince it is evident, from Experi|ence, that Sin and Vice doth, in the Nature of it, tend to make us mi&s;erable; being contrary to to all that is rea&s;onable and right; contrary to the Attributes and Will of GOD; contrary to the clear Sen&s;e of our own Minds, and to all the Intere&s;ts of Society; and mu&s;t therefore do a perpetual Violence to our rea&s;onable and &s;ocial Nature; and con&s;equently be mo&s;t odious in the Sight of GOD, and all intelligent Beings, as being unavoidably attended with Horror and Confu&s;ion, both per&s;onal and &s;ocial: And &s;ince, on the other Hand, it is no le&s;s evident, that a virtuous and dutiful Temper and Behaviour, doth, in the Nature of it, tend to our Happi|ne&s;s,

becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;teth in doing all that is rea&s;onable and right, all that is agreeable to the Attributes and Will of GOD, to the Sen&s;e of our own Minds, and to all the Intere&s;ts of So|ciety, and therefore mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily approve it|&s;elf, as mo&s;t beautiful and amiable in the Sight of GOD, and all rea&s;onable Beings, as being at|tended with univer&s;al Harmony, Peace and Joy, both within and without, with regard both to GOD and Man; it is hence evident, that GOD's Glory mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in our pur&s;uing our own Hap|pine&s;s, by avoiding the one, and doing the other.</P>
<P N="12">&sect; 12. BUT now to return: Since I am con|vinced, from the above Method of Rea&s;oning, that my Well-being and Happine&s;s mu&s;t have been GOD's End in giving me my Being, and that it mu&s;t be a Happine&s;s &s;uitable to that Na|ture which He hath given me, in the Whole of it; I mu&s;t be per&s;uaded, that &s;ince, be&s;ides an animal and &s;en&s;itive, He hath moreover given me a rational, active and &s;ocial Nature, as my &s;uperior and peculiar Character (Chap. I. &sect; 5.) it is plain He mu&s;t have de&s;igned men not meerly for a &s;en&s;ual and animal, but chiefly for a rational, ac|tive and &s;ocial Happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="13">&sect; 13. IT cannot therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed an End worthy of GOD, and agreeable to the Na|ture He hath given me, in the Whole of it, that I &s;hould have been brought into Being, only to eat and drink, and &s;leep, and enjoy the empty Gratifications of the animal Life, and that my Rea&s;on, and other &s;uperior Powers, &s;hould be de&s;igned only to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the&s;e inferior Plea&s;ures (and in Effect only to render me more a Bea&s;t than I &s;hould have been without them) and that after a few Days &s;pent in the&s;e low, grovelling Pur&s;uits and Enjoyments, I &s;hould

then be utterly extinct, cea&s;e, and be no more. The&s;e &s;hort lived animal Enjoyments are indeed Ends &s;uitable to the Nature of a meer Bea&s;t, and for which he is better qualified than I am: But if the&s;e could be &s;uppo&s;ed all the Ends that I was made for, the noble Powers of Rea&s;on, Reflec|tion, Self-exertion and Self-determination, mu&s;t have been given me in vain; nay, indeed to the wor&s;t Purpo&s;es, as they only &s;erve to make me more exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ual, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;en&s;ible of my Wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P N="14">&sect; 14. AT lea&s;t this is certain, that the&s;e no|ble Powers render me capable of a va&s;tly high|er End, and nobler Happine&s;s, and which cannot attain to its Perfection here: For when I con&s;i|der the wretched Circum&s;tances of my Condi|tion in this Life, it is plain that &s;uch a Happine&s;s can be but a little While, and but very imperfectly enjoyed, in this pre&s;ent, &s;hort, uncertain and unea&s;y State, amid&s;t &s;o many Sins and Follies, Embarra&s;ments and Perplexities, as I am, at be&s;t, unavoidably attended with, while in this Body. Since therefore I am evidently made for &s;uch an Happine&s;s, and that it cannot attain to any tole|rable Degree of Perfection here, I mu&s;t con|clude that my Exi&s;tence &s;hall undoubtedly reach beyond this &s;hort and uncertain Life, and extend forward to endle&s;s Ages. Without this Conclu|&s;ion, I cannot &s;ee how I &s;hall ever attain to any End worthy of the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of the GOD that made me, and &s;uitable to the &s;uperi|or Nature and Powers which he hath given me, and the &s;uperior Happine&s;s I am evidently capa|ble of.</P>

THE chief Difficulty that lies in the Way of this Per&s;ua&s;ion of a future State, is the Inconceivablene&s;s of it: But this, I think, can be no rea&s;onable Objection again&s;t it: For who, that had never &s;een any Thing but the univer&s;al De&s;olation and Death of a &s;evere Winter, could conceive any Thing of the exqui&s;ite Beauties and admirable Productions of a fine Spring and Sum|mer? Indeed I can no more conceive how my Soul is now united to my Body, and perceives and acts by Means of it, and by a meer Thought can move its unweildy Limbs at Plea&s;ure, than I can conceive how it can exi&s;t, perceive and act, after what we call Death, without this gro&s;s tangible Machine, to which it is at pre&s;ent con|fined. I can, however, a little a&s;&s;i&s;t my Imagi|nation in forming &s;ome glimmering Notion of that future State, from this ea&s;y Suppo&s;ition of a Man born blind and deaf, who, at the &s;ame time, hath the Sen&s;es of Feeling, Ta&s;ting and Smelling.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Guardian,</HI> No. 27.</NOTE> Now, to this Man, the tangible World, with the various Objects of Ta&s;te and Smell, is all the World that he can have any No|tion of, any more than I can conceive of tho&s;e <HI>Things which Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, nor have they enter'd into the Heart of Man to conceive.</HI> I, who have the vi&s;ible World about me, and the Perception of various Sounds, am to this Man, what I may &s;uppo&s;e Angels and other Spirits are to me: He can no more conceive of the vi&s;ible World that I conver&s;e with, than I can conceive of the &s;piritual World, or the fu|ture

State of my Being. Now, let me only con|ceive this Man to be deprived of the Sen&s;es of Feeling, Ta&s;ting and Smelling, and he is dead, intirely dead, to all the World that he had ever any Notion of. But then imagine his Eyes and Ears to be opened, and to have this glorious Show of vi&s;ible Objects, Light and Colours, with all their various Modifications, &s;et before him, with a no le&s;s wonderful Variety of harmo|nious Sounds; I mu&s;t conceive him to have in|tirely a new World open upon him, to which he was before an utter Stranger. He is indeed dead to the dark tangible World, but he hath exchanged it for a new vi&s;ible World. Such a Change is very conceiveable; but it cannot be imagined that what we call Death can be a greater; nor can I believe it will be &s;o great a Change, it be|ing highly probable that Seeing, Hearing, and &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tances of Feeling, are com|mon to both our pre&s;ent and future State, and a Fund to begin with (together with our intellec|tual and moral Accompli&s;hments) when we enter upon that new Condition, wherein I can con|ceive that other and more exqui&s;ite Sen&s;es may be added to the&s;e, and not only the&s;e Sen&s;es, but al&s;o our Under&s;tandings, Memory and Activity, may be advanced to a much greater Perfection than they had before.

in my Dealings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as I mu&s;t conclude it to be wrong to treat others ill in any of the&s;e, or the like In&s;tances; &s;o, on the other Hand, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on that I think it right, that, in Sub|ordination to the publick Sen&s;e and Intere&s;t (<HI>i. e.</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing no Forfeiture) every One &s;hould allow me the quiet and peaceable Enjoyment of my own, my Innocence, Life, Limbs, Liberty, E&s;tate, Wife, Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;peak nothing but the Truth to me, and of me, and deal equi|taby, fairly and faithfully with me, and in every Thing treat me as being what I am and have, <HI>(Ibid.)</HI> I mu&s;t think it right, and my Duty ac|cordingly, from the &s;ame Principle, to treat others with Equity in all the&s;e Re&s;pects, as I would wi&s;h to be treated by them in the like Cir|cum&s;tances. And this Duty is called <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> in the &s;trict Sen&s;e of it, which comprehends <HI>Exam|plarine&s;s, Equity, Truth</HI> and <HI>Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> in Op|po&s;ition to all In&s;tances of <HI>Inju&s;tice;</HI> &s;uch as, <HI>tempting</HI> to Sin, <HI>Murther, Maiming, Adultery, Fornication, Stealth, Robbery, Oppre&s;&s;ion, Lying, Defamation, Unfaithfulne&s;s</HI> to Engagements, <HI>Cheating,</HI> and all <HI>Deceitfulne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. (4.) FOR the like Rea&s;ons; &s;ince I feel a great Delight in being well re&s;pected, duly e&s;teem'd, well &s;poken of, and kindly treated by others (Part I. Chap. I. &sect; 13.) I mu&s;t think it my Duty, from the &s;ame benevolent Princi|ple, to treat others with all &s;uch Di&s;po&s;i|tions, Acts and In&s;tances of Kindne&s;s and good U&s;age, as I &s;hould, in my Turn, rea&s;onably ex|pect, and take Plea&s;ure in receiving; to be rea|dy to all good Offices in my Power to others, whether Neighbours or Strangers, whether to their Souls or Bodies; to &s;ay the be&s;t of them,

Thus by reflecting and conceiving our&s;elves in each other's Circum&s;tances (Part I. Chap.

<P N="6">&sect; 6. (5.) INASMUCH as it is manife&s;t, from what was ob&s;erved above, under the fir&s;t general Head of the Duty we owe to Society, that it is incumbent upon us to do all we can to promote the Weal of our Fellow-Creatures, and to have a principal Zeal for the general Good, on which our own Welfare does very much depend (Part I. Chap. I. &sect; 13. And Part II. Chap. I. &sect; 6.) and &s;ince there may be &s;everal Things in our

Power, above and beyond what meer Ju&s;tice and Humanity require, wherein we may be u&s;eful to others, and to the Publick; I mu&s;t think it my Duty, from the &s;ame Principle, to be of a free and generous Spirit as far as I am able; to be forward and ready to every good Work, and to delight in doing Good, as GOD him&s;elf does, wherein&s;oever I may be u&s;eful in promoting his Honour, and the Good of Mankind; and this from a Sen&s;e of Gratitude to him for all I enjoy. This Virtue is called <HI>Liberality, Genero&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Magnificence,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Niggardline&s;s,</HI> or a <HI>grudging, narrow</HI> and <HI>con|tracted Spirit.</HI> And for any Benefits received ei|ther of GOD or Man, <HI>Gratitude</HI> is due to the Benefactor, in Oppo&s;ition to a &s;tupid <HI>ungrateful Spirit,</HI> which is extremely ba&s;e and odious.</P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. (6.) SINCE the Peace and Quietne&s;s of Society, which are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to its Happine&s;s, depend not only on our avoiding eve|ry Thing that is injurious, and doing all that is ju&s;t, kind and generous, but al&s;o upon every One's being contented in his own Station, and faithfully endeavouring to di&s;charge the Duties of it, without intermeddling in Affairs that do not belong to his Province; and upon every One's being of a Peace-making and forgiving Spirit, (Part II. Chap. II. &sect; 6.) I mu&s;t therefore think it my Duty to keep within my own Sphere, and mind my own Bu&s;ine&s;s, and do the Duty that be|longs to my own Station; and if I have done any Wrong, to repair the Injury, and make Re&s;titu|tion, and a&s;k Forgivene&s;s, as well as to be of a forgiving Spirit towards others, as I would hope GOD to be &s;o towards me; and in a Word, to do all that is in my Power for promoting and pre|&s;erving

Let me e&s;pecially have a great Reverence for the Sen&s;e of my own Con&s;cience, as being the Divine Light irradiating me within, and the Voice of the Deity Him&s;elf, that I may take the utmo&s;t Care, not to live in any Cour&s;e what&s;oever for which my own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience &s;hall re|proach me; for as One's Con&s;cience is properly One's Self, it is the greate&s;t Madne&s;s in the World, for a Man to live at a perpetual Variance with him&s;elf, and the fir&s;t Point of Wi&s;dom, always to keep Friends with him&s;elf.</P>

<P N="1">1. O THOU Almighty BEING, on whom dependeth the Exi&s;tence of the World, and every Creature therein, and by whom all Things are governed and conducted to the &s;everal Ends of their Being, according to the various Natures which Thou ha&s;t given them: By who&s;e good Providence I have been brought into Being, and mo&s;t kindly pre&s;erved and pro|vided for, from the Beginning of my Life to this Moment, and enjoyed many unde&s;erved Advan|tages and Favours, with regard both to my Well-being in this Life, and my everla&s;ting Happine&s;s in the Life to come; and e&s;pecially the ine&s;timable Advantages of Thy Holy Go&s;pel, made known to us in Thy Name, by Thy ble&s;&s;ed Son JESUS CHRIST, and all that He hath taught, and done, and &s;uffered for us; I be&s;eech Thee graciou&s;ly to accept of my mo&s;t grateful Sen&s;e and Acknow|ledgment of all Thy Bounty and Beneficence towards me. <HI>Ble&s;s</HI> JEHOVAH, <HI>O my Soul, and all that is within me, ble&s;s His holy Name: Ble&s;s</HI> JEHOVAH, <HI>O my Soul, and forget not all His Be|nefits: Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities, and healeth all thine Infirmities: Who redeemeth thy Life from De&s;truction, and crowneth thee with lov|ing Kindne&s;s and tender Mercies!

AND whereas, notwith&s;tanding the mighty Obligations of Thy Goodne&s;s, I have, in many In&s;tances, ungratefully and perver&s;ly &s;inned again&s;t Thy mo&s;t righteous and rea&s;onable Laws, in neglecting to do what Thou ha&s;t commanded, and in doing what Thou ha&s;t forbidden; I hum|bly profe&s;s before Thee, my utter Abhorrence of all my Perver&s;ene&s;s, and my &s;erious Re&s;olution, by Thy Grace, to be more watchful again&s;t all Temptations, and to amend my Conduct for the Time to come. And I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly beg the Forgivene&s;s of my many Offences, through Thy infinite Mercies in Thy Son JESUS CHRIST, and that Thou wilt for His Sake, deliver me from the evil Con&s;equences of all my Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions and Follies. And I humbly be&s;eech the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Thy Holy Spirit, to endue me with &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions and Powers, as may carry me innocently and &s;afely through all future Trials; and to enable me upon all Occa&s;ions, from a Sen&s;e of Duty to Thee, my GOD, to behave my&s;elf conformable to Thy mo&s;t holy Laws, which are indeed the Laws of Rea&s;on and Na|ture, in all Wi&s;dom, Probity and Virtue, and in the faithful Di&s;charge of all the Duties of Tem|perance, Piety and Benevolence, with a humble Dependence upon thy infinite Wi&s;dom, Power and Goodne&s;s, and under a lively and habitual Sen&s;e of thy All-&s;eeing Eye, and the Account I am to give of my&s;elf to Thee.</P>

Grant that I may, at lea&s;t, pa&s;s my Time in Peace, with Contentment and Tran|quility of Mind; and, that having faithfully di&s;|charged my Duty to Thee, my GOD, to my Family and Friends, and to my Country and all Mankind, and endeavoured to improve my&s;elf in all virtuous Habits, and u&s;eful Knowledge, and done all the Good I could, throughout the whole Cour&s;e of my Continuance in this World, I may, at la&s;t, calmly and decently take my Departure from this pre&s;ent Stage, and then happily find my&s;elf in a better State; even a State of unmix|ed and endle&s;s Happine&s;s in the Life to come.</P>
