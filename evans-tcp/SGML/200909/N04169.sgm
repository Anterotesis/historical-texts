<HEAD>A Premonition to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the &s;aving Change of a Sin|ners Hearts, is the &s;uperna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ural Work of God alone; yet he brings it about in a way agreeable to their natural Practices, and Endowments as rea&s;onable Beings; and u&s;es rational proper means with them for that End. Hence are all the In&s;tructions, Motives, Ar|guments, and Expo&s;tulations, which are in the Scriptures; which are not only for the Spi|ritual Progre&s;s of the renew'd and &s;anctified; but al&s;o for the Conver&s;ion of the ungodly, and Sinners; as may be abundantly &s;een through|out both Te&s;taments. God in his Word, deals with Man, even in his Apo&s;tace unre|generate Condition, as an intelligent Creature, by all the Topicks of Argument and Ratio|nal Per&s;wa&s;ion. Accordingly tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t employs as his Amba&s;&s;adors, in the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, are to labour not only for the Spi|ritual Good and Comfort of the Regenerate Children of God; but al&s;o with the unre|new'd and unholy, for their &s;aving Conver&s;i|on, by all tho&s;e rational Means where|with God has furni&s;h'd them in his Word. And 'tis as plainly both the Duty and Inte|re&s;t of Sinners (tho' they cannot &s;avin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly Change them&s;elves yet) to take up them&s;elves, and as much as po&s;&s;ible conform them&s;elves to
<PB N="4" REF="005132_0003_1017436EABFD8D08">God's declared Will; and, in that Way, to &s;eek ince&s;&s;antly for renewing Grace, and a &s;aving vital Union with Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This is but to act as becomes rational Creatures in their Circum&s;tances: 'Tis the Command of God, and the only Way of rea&s;onable Hope.</P>
<P>Agreeably to the&s;e Things, I have in the following Di&s;cour&s;e addre&s;s'd the Rea&s;on, and con&s;idering Faculty of the Irreligious, in be|half of Religion, and their Souls eternal In|tere&s;t: And &s;hew'd from many Con&s;iderations, the unparellel'd Unrea&s;onablene&s;s and Bruti&s;h|ne&s;s, of Irreligion and Impenitence; which might be &s;ufficient to confound with Shame and deep Concern, e&s;pecially &s;uch as highly Value them&s;elves upon that truly valuable En|dowment of the Human Nature, their Under|&s;tanding and Rea&s;on, and yet live irreligious and ungodly Lives. As I hinted already I know Mankind are &s;o far depraved and cor|rupted, that nothing but the Almighty to change and reclaim them: But yet &s;uitable and adap|ted means are to be u&s;ed for that End, both by the Preacher, and the Sinner him&s;elf. And it is by, and in the u&s;e of the&s;e that God ordinarily Works this Effect.</P>
<P>I think &s;uch a Sermon as this is e&s;pecially &s;ea&s;onable at this Time, when the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ravians,</HI> lately come to the&s;e Parts of the World, Teach, that Mini&s;ters are not to u&s;e &s;uch Methods with the ungodly; and, that ungodly Sinners them&s;elves, are not to u&s;e any endeavours this Way, in &s;eeking to God for their Conver&s;i|on and Salvation: From the &s;pecious Argu|ments,
<PB N="5" REF="005132_0004_10174371B29B5E38">that Salvation is not of Works, and that Chri&s;t needs not our help to convert us: As may be clearly &s;een in Count <HI>Zinzendorff</HI>'s printed Di&s;cour&s;es. This is to make Man like a brute or a block, rather than a Rea&s;onable Creature; and fairly to lay the Reins on li|cencious Sinners Necks, and allow them to run where they Plea&s;e. It is very true Sal|vation is not of Works, either by a Merit of Congruity or Condignity (as the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> Term and Di&s;tingui&s;h it) &s;o that Sinners ought not to &s;et about reforming, with a View to ap|pea&s;e God, or to excite his Love and Favour towards them, by any imagin'd excellency in their Works of Obedience, as I have carefully directed in the Clo&s;e of the Sermon: And yet it is as true, that the utmo&s;t Efforts of unregenerate Sinners to ob&s;erve the Divine Law, and &s;eek the Mercy of God, and their Souls Salvation, is their indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty, their rea&s;onable Service, and God's expre&s;s Command; or el&s;e a great Part of the Bible is wrong, wherein they are enjoyned to <HI>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate, Luke</HI> 13.24. And, <HI>all Men every where is commanded to repent, be|cau&s;e God hath appointed a Day in which he will judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Acts</HI> 17.30, 31. with numberle&s;s other Places. If God requires the ungodly to turn from their irreligious Cour&s;es, to &s;eek and endeavour to &s;erve him; the they ought to do &s;o: And that under the highe&s;t Pains, of his terrible and dread Di&s;plea&s;ure. If God does not require it of them, then it is not their Sin not to do &s;o; and con&s;equently they are no Sinners, but doing Right enough; for where no Law is, there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: And then con&s;e|quently
<PB N="6" REF="005132_0005_10174374B924CCA8">again, they have no Hell nor Dam|nation to fear; for where there is no Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, there is no Puni&s;hment, in a ju&s;t Go|vernment. Thus you may &s;ee where this Doc|trine leads. May the Lord pre&s;erve People from &s;uch a dangerous and fearfull Snare, which tends to del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de them to their De&s;truc|tion, and al&s;o, pre&s;erve them from re&s;ting upon means, and putting their own Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s in the place of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s; which is as fatal upon the other Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iae <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uti&s;&s;imus ibis.</HI></P>
<P>Re&s;ting upon means is incon&s;i&s;tent with, and a Bar in the way of believing in Chri&s;t; but the u&s;e of means, as means, is not; but is the expre&s;s Command of God, and the Sinners Duty. It is ridiculous arguing here, that Chri&s;t needs not Sinners help to convert them: For, who ever ima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in'd that they were to u&s;e means, with a View to help Chri&s;t to Convert them. But this is not a proper Place to pur&s;ue this Argument in its full Latitude. What I have already &s;aid may be &s;ufficient here.</P>
<P>I know not of any thing in the following Di&s;cour&s;e, that I am any way obliged to Ac|count for, except it be the high De&s;cription I have given of the Repentance which may be attained to, by unregenerate Men. I wou'd have it ob&s;erved, that I expre&s;ly include the ordinary Concurrence of the Holy Spirit: And how far the Spirit of God may concur, by way of common Operation, with the En|deavour of natural Men, I think we cannot Determine. I am &s;atisfy'd that when the Holy
<PB N="7" REF="005132_0006_101743763B04CF78">Spirit lays hold of Sinners with a De&s;ign of their &s;aving Conver&s;ion, he frequently brings them to &s;uch a Degree of Repentance, even before the &s;aving Change is wrought in their Hearts.

<P>I hearkened and heard, but they &s;pake not aright: No Man repented him of his wickedne&s;s, &s;aying, what have I done? Every one turned to his Cour&s;e, as the Hor&s;e ru&s;heth into the Battle.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words are a part of a Prophe|cy or divine Me&s;&s;age which begins with the foregoing Chapter, where|in the Lord by his Prophet calls us Sinfull, Rebellious and Apo&s;tate Peo|ple, to Repentance and Amendment, to turn from their &s;infull Cour&s;es and abominable Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, to the obedience of his Laws, as may be &s;een in the 3d, 5th, and 6th, Ver|&s;es of that Chapter. This the Lord pre&s;&s;es up|on them from two great Arguments, viz. <HI>The Bene&s;t they &s;hould enjoy upon their true Reformati|on, and the terrible Judgment they &s;hould &s;u&s;tain upon their ob&s;tinate refu&s;al and impeniten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI> Upon their thorough Reformation the Lord promi&s;es them a peaceable and pro&s;perous Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their plea&s;ant Land, v. 7. But upon their pro|ceeding on &s;till in their wicked Ways, he threa|tens them with the mo&s;t dreadful De&s;olation, Death, and Captivity, generally throughout the Chapter.</P>
<P>This Argument the Lord father Pro&s;e|cutes in the beginning of this Chapter, &s;hew|ing the extent of that <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> and <HI>contempt</HI> which he was about to bring upon them, and which in a little Time he did bring upon them by <HI>Ne|buchadnezar</HI>'s Army: And then in the 4th and 5th Ver&s;es he aggravates the <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>madne&s;s</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="005132_0008_1017437DD4B9DCC8">of their ob&s;tinacy and bold Re&s;olu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions in per|&s;i&s;ting in their wickedne&s;s, by ob&s;erving to them that it was folly unexampled, of which there are no parallel In&s;tances to be found in any o|ther ca&s;es. Thus &s;aith the Lord, <HI>&s;hall they fail and not ari&s;e? &s;hall he turn away and not return?</HI> As if he had &s;aid, can any Per&s;ons &s;o &s;of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h and unwi&s;e be found, as will not ri&s;e up again, after they are fallen down upon the Ground? Can any &s;uch demented Per&s;on be found, who will not return to his right Road, after he has wandred out of it and gone wrong? &s;urely no; common Prudence will teach Men better in &s;uch Ca&s;es. Why then, &s;ays he, is this People of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;liden back by a perpetual back-&s;liding; O! unexampled mad|ne&s;s! Tho' they have gone wofully out of the way, and are a wandring in their own ways, to their eternal De&s;truction, and have been over and over told of it from me, in the mo&s;t moving and awful Terms; yet they pre&s;ump|tuou&s;ly go on and turn not; their back-&s;liding is perpetual, they hold fa&s;t deceit and refu&s;e to return. And this their continuance in a cour&s;e of Sin and Di&s;obedience, again&s;t all the warnings he had given them, and Pains which he had be&s;towed upon them, the Lord more fully and pathetically expre&s;&s;es in the Words of our Text, <HI>I hearkned and heard but they &s;peak not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t: No Man,</HI> &amp;c. In the Words you may Notice the&s;e few particulars. 1&s;t, It is inti|mated that the Means which God had u&s;ed with that People, were &s;uch as that a Refor|mation among them, might rea&s;onably have been expected by them. This is implied in the&s;e Words, <HI>I hearkned and heard,</HI> in the&s;e Words are pre&s;uppos'd the means which God had previou&s;ly u&s;ed to them e&s;pecially by the
<PB N="3" REF="005132_0009_1017437F58830640">frequent Me&s;&s;ages of his Word, in the Mouth of his Prophets: And &s;o they &s;ignify how rea&s;onably a thorough Reformation among them, might have been expected thereupon. <HI>I heark|ned and heard,</HI> &s;ays the Lord <HI>i. e.</HI> as if he had &s;aid, having u&s;ed &s;uch proper methods with them for their Repentance, which were &s;uffici|ent to have influenced them thereto, then I hearkned and li&s;tned to hear if there were any di&s;cour&s;e like Repentance among them, any talk that might give Hopes of their Amendment and Conver&s;ion, whether any were bewailing their pa&s;t Impieties, and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, &s;aying, with Shame and Sorrow, alas what have I done!</P>
<P>The great God repre&s;ents him&s;elf in a familiar conde&s;cending way, after the manner of Man, as expecting and hoping that the means which he had u&s;ed with them, might po&s;&s;ibly have had &s;ome good effect upon them, in their Re|formation; and &s;o be hearkned to hear what they were a &s;aying about it. He carefully look'd and ob&s;erved, whether there were any &s;igns and appearances of their Repentance, after his Pains with them for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet the&s;e and all other &s;uch like Expre&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t be under&s;tood in a Way agreeable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the divine Perfections, &s;o as not to infer tho&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es and Imperfections in God, which are in Creatures, and therefore not to be un|der&s;tood in the mo&s;t &s;trict and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">eral Sen&s;e of the Words.

<P>3d. The Text declares how wilfully and bruti&s;hly re&s;olute the&s;e People were in their wicked Cour&s;es.

<P><PB N="6" REF="005132_0012_10174388B10FEFC0">

<P>The Truth of this Propo&s;ition will clearly appear by con&s;idering and comparing one or two things. <HI>1&s;t.</HI> That Sinners are rational Creatures, and &s;o ought to be influenced and wrought upon in matters of Practice, if they would not forfeit all claim to that Character, by rational Means, by powerful convincing Arguments and Con&s;iderations.

The great God lays before Sinners in his Word the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s, Equity, and Excellency of Holine&s;s; the ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Title and Sovereign claim which he has to their Obedience, both as he is a God of inconceivable Glory and infinite Perfections, worthy to be &s;erv'd honour'd and ador'd by all rational beings be&s;ide; and as they are his Creatures, created by him for that End, to glorify and &s;erve him and enjoy the highe&s;t ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in him; and as he is their con&s;tant Pre&s;erver, the upholder of their Lives and giver of all their Benefits; upon all which Accounts they owe them&s;elves entire|ly to him as his own Property, and the Sub|jects of his moral Government, by a mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary and inalienable Right.

<P><HI>2dly.</HI> But I mu&s;t proceed to con&s;ider the <HI>2d.</HI> Propo&s;ition, which is, that the Repentance which God requires of Sinners, upon his deal|ing with them by the &s;olemn Me&s;&s;ages of his
<PB N="14" REF="005132_0020_1017439F72D79060">Word, mu&s;t be attended with Confe&s;&s;ion, Shame, and Sorrow.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall a little farther open up and ex|plain the Repentance intended in this Propo|&s;ition, and my De&s;ign is not particularly to open up the nature of the &s;aving Grace of Repent|ance, which is only in regenerate and &s;anctify'd Per&s;ons, and nece&s;&s;arily requires the &s;uperna|tural Principles of Sanctifying Grace implanted in the Soul by the Holy Gho&s;t, as the Foun|dation and Spring of it; but the Repentance which I de&s;ign to &s;peak to, and which I think is the Repentance intended in the Text, is that which Sinners thro' the Means and Advan|tages of God's Word faithfully deliver'd to them, may generally, by the ordinary Concur|rence of God's Spirit perform, if they act &s;o ra|tionally and faithfully as they may and ought to do; which Repentance God requires them to perform as the Way of their &s;eeking, and mo&s;t hopeful Means for obtaining his par|doning Mercy and &s;anctifying Grace thro' Chri&s;t Je&s;us. It is, in &s;hort that Repentance which the Lord looks that Sinners &s;hould generally perform, &s;uch as are not judicially harden'd at lea&s;t&punc; to whom he has &s;ent the Me&s;&s;ages of his Word for that End, when he &s;ays, <HI>Hearkened and heard to find whether any Man repented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of his Wickedne&s;s, &s;aying what have I done.</HI></P>
<P>And in this Repentance two Things are to be con&s;idered: The Thing if &s;elf &s;ub&s;tantially and its Qualifications or nece&s;&s;ary Adjuncts. And 1&s;t. This Repentance &s;trictly and &s;ub|&s;tantially con&s;ider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in it &s;elf is a turning from, and oppo&s;ing of Sin, and an Application to the
<PB N="15" REF="005132_0021_101743A582263778">Duties of Religion, univer&s;ally both in Heart and Life. A Sinner never practices any Thing like Repentance till he comes to this; to for|&s;ake entirely his &s;inful Cour&s;es, with&s;tand all Snares and Temptations to them, and wre&s;tle again&s;t the inward Corruptions of his Heart; to betake him&s;elf to the pre&s;cribed Ways of Re|ligion, and mo&s;t &s;olemnly and earne&s;tly to &s;eek the Mercy and Favour of an offended and pro|voked God.

<P><HI>2dly.</HI> As to the Qualifications of this Re|pentance, they are Confe&s;&s;ion, Shame and Sor|row. 1.

It is not enough that Per&s;ons barely acknowledge the &s;inful Actions and Neglects that they have been guilty of; there is no doubt of their ac|knowledging them if they remember them; for it is not po&s;&s;ible that they can deny the&s;e Things before God whatever they may do to Men; &s;o far as their Memory &s;erves them they can't but be &s;elf con&s;cious of what they have done or not done; but they mu&s;t acknowledge and be &s;en&s;ible of their Sinfulne&s;s and Wick|edne&s;s in the&s;e Actions and Omi&s;&s;ions. That the general Cour&s;e of their Practice has been a Cour&s;e of wicked Rebellion and Di&s;obedience again&s;t God. While Sinners continue to ju&s;tify their Practices, and tho' they will confe&s;s in general Terms that they are very &s;inful Crea|tures yet will hardly acknowledge it in any one particular In&s;tance, or if &s;ome inward ac|knowledgments of their Sin in &s;ome or many particular Things be extorted from them by the Light of their Con&s;ciences, while they endea|vour &s;till to le&s;&s;en the Sinfulne&s;s of the&s;e Things in their own View, to make it appear as very little and trivial, or always plead Excu&s;es and make Apologies for them&s;elves to their Con&s;ciences, I &s;ay, &s;o long as it is thus with Sinners they are far far from Repentance.

<P><HI>3dly</HI> Another Qualification of this Repent|ance is deep Sorrow and Grief of Heart. O!

<P>In the Beginning of the Di&s;cour&s;e upon this Head of Doctrine, I &s;ignified that there was a Difference between this Repentance and that which is the Effect of &s;anctifying Grace which only is infallibly connected with Salvation; and here, before I di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;s thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, I wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d ju&s;t mention one or two of the Principal Dif|ferences, 1.

<P>Now, this Repentance and Humiliation which I have been di&s;cour&s;ing of, is nece&s;&s;ary for Sinners to practice in order to their Rege|neration, and the true Conver&s;ion of their Souls to God; in order to the Sanctification of their Hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to be &s;ay'd; <HI>I or except a Man he born of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God</HI> John 3.5. <HI>and without Holine&s;s no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord</HI> Heb. 12.14.</P>

<P>But I pa&s;s on to &s;peak a little and but a little, to the 3d. Ob&s;ervation, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is bruti&s;h, Irrational, and Wilful for Sinners to go on &s;till in their &s;inful Cour&s;es, again&s;t all the In|&s;tructions and &s;olemn Warnings of God's Word.</P>
<P>Indeed, to Sin again&s;t God, much more to continue to do &s;o, in any Circum&s;tances is a ve|ry bruti&s;h Thing, in as much as it is mo&s;t Un|rea&s;onable: Obedience to the Sovereign God being mo&s;t ju&s;tly due from a rational Crea|ture.

<P>But, how much more bruti&s;h and irrational is it for Per&s;ons to go on &s;till in a Cour&s;e of Sin and Rebellion again&s;t God, who are favour'd with the cleare&s;t Light and &s;tronge&s;t Argu|ments of his Holy Word, mo&s;t &s;olemnly and repeatedly urged upon them: Arguments ju&s;tly brought from all the Topicks of rational Per|&s;wa&s;ion, from the intrin&s;ick Rea&s;onablene&s;s, Beauty, and Excellence of Obedience to the great God; and con&s;equently the unrea&s;onablene&s;s and un&s;peakable Ba&s;ene&s;s of Sin, from the endearing and tender Obligations of Goodne&s;s and Mer|cy, and &s;o from that amiable Di&s;po&s;ition of Gratitude and thankful Sen&s;e of unde&s;erv'd Favour, and from the Topicks of immortal Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery in the Life to come, both which are Un&s;peakable in their Dura|tion and Degree.

<P>The Truth of this Ob&s;ervation may &s;uffici|ently appear from what has been &s;aid already up-upon the fir&s;t Head of Doctrine, for if a Reformation from Sin, and earne&s;t Endeavours in &s;eeking after the Favour and Mercy of God, may be rea&s;onably expected of Sinners, to whom God has &s;ent the Me&s;&s;ages of his Word for that End, then certainly their Impeniten|cy and Continuance in Sin after all is mo&s;t

<P>But farther, is it not irrational and bruti&s;h for Per&s;ons to be chiefly taken up about pre|&s;ent Things, and little or nothing concern'd about the Condition in the Time to come?
