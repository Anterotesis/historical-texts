<P>MY wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing my former Letter to take off the A&s;per&s;ions, which have been injuriou&s;ly ca&s;t upon the Church, was principally occa&s;ion|ed by this very <HI>J. G.</HI> who, without any manner of Provocation&punc; had (as &s;ome of his Friends have own|ed) written a &s;currilous Paper of Ver&s;es, which did mo&s;t abominably mi&s;repre&s;ent, and abu&s;e the Church, and tend to beget in People a very wrong Notion of it, and a bitter, uncharitable Temper towards it: And now, in &s;pight of all the Caution and Tenderne&s;s wherewith I endeavoured to conduct my &s;elf, both in my Conver&s;ation and Letter, is &s;till re&s;olved to go on reproaching and mi&s;repre&s;enting us, and &s;etting us in all the odious &amp; ridiculous Lights he can invent.&mdash;For my part, I &s;incerely aimed at reconciling the Difference between you and us, and compo&s;ing our Spirits as far as I was able, that if po&s;&s;ible we might come at a right under&s;tanding of each other, and a good Agreement; or at lea&s;t, if we could not attain to think alike, that

we might not think hardly, cen&s;oriou&s;ly or injuriou&s;ly of each other, and might live in tolerable good Peace and Charity one with another. But this Man is re|&s;olved to &s;et, and keep us &s;till at a variance, &amp; to blow up the Fire of Contention and Uncharitablene&s;s, and all for&s;ooth, under the Preten&s;e of <HI>doing Ju&s;tice!</HI> tho you will find by what follows, that his <HI>Remarks</HI> are in Truth one continued Piece of <HI>Inju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>As to my &s;elf, I regard not his Reproaches: Let him rail and try to expo&s;e and vilifie me as much as he plea&s;es; his Wrath is impotent, and cannot hurt me: I do heartily forgive him, and pray God give him Re|pentance and Forgivene&s;s!&mdash;and as to his reproachful and abu&s;ive Treatment of the Church, I will only &s;ay, <HI>the Lord rebuke thee.</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you that as I am not di&s;|po&s;ed, on &s;o &s;erious a Subject, to be either angry or merry; &s;o I &s;hall not go into &s;uch a Method in defen|ding our Cau&s;e: <HI>I have not &s;o lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned Chri&s;t:</HI> The Church of <HI>England</HI> does not need &s;uch a furious, &s;cold|ing, delu&s;ive Management, in defending her: She has &s;tood the te&s;t of Time, of Fire and Faggot, of Civil Rage and Tumult, of Popi&s;h Tyranny and Enthu&s;ia&s;|tic Anarchy, and is not to be look'd out of Counte|nance at this time of Day, by the bold In&s;ults, and brazen E&s;trontery of little impertinent Adver&s;aries God has abundantly a&s;&s;ured the World that the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> which has ever been allowed to be the Bulwark of the Reformation, is dear to Him, by <HI>delivering her in Six Troubles, and in Seven,</HI> by a Series of remarkable, (I had almo&s;t &s;aid) <HI>miraculous</HI> Providences, and <HI>ha|ving delivered us &s;o often,</HI> and <HI>from &s;o great Deaths, we tru&s;t in Him that He will yet deliver us.</HI> The <HI>Wrath of Man &s;hall Prai&s;e thee, O Lord, and the Remainder thereof &s;hall thou Re&s;train!</HI></P>

little of the Gentleman, or the Chri&s;tian; that he &s;hould betray &s;o much ill Breeding, as well as ill Temper, as he does by &s;o much ba&s;e Language, and &s;uch odious In&s;inuations; However, <HI>The Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD,</HI> and I doubt not but He will over-rule all this wrathful Treatment of us in &s;uch a manner as to make it turn to our Advantage; as it is, on the other hand a great Di&s;grace to your Cau&s;e, that it &s;hould be defended in &s;uch a &s;currilous manner, in&s;o|much that mo&s;t of the &s;ober, &s;erious &amp; thinking Peo|ple among your &s;elves have often declared them&s;elves a&s;hamed of it, and even your Mini&s;ters will not ven|ture to offer a Syllable in defence of it.</P>
<P>It is indeed unaccountable to many con&s;iderate and moderate-&s;pirited People of both Per&s;ua&s;ions, what can be the Occa&s;ion of it, that this Man, and &s;ome others like him, &s;hould di&s;cover &s;uch a bitter Spirit again&s;t the Church of <HI>England</HI> in the Country, and rai&s;e &s;uch an hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eous outcry, as if it were the greate&s;t Judgment that ever befel it? What can tempt them to make &s;uch dolorous Lamentations, as tho' our Church was the mo&s;t heretical, corrupt and abomina|ble Communion in the World? How can it be &s;uch a dreadful Grief to them, as tho' we brought another Religion, or <HI>another Go&s;pel among you which you have not received?</HI> Whereas it is not &s;o, my Brethren, we have the &s;ame Religion, the &s;ame Go&s;pel, and the &s;ame Hope with you; only we think in &s;ome Things you are mi&s;taken, and that you are in the wrong in being on the &s;ide of tho&s;e that &s;eperate from &s;o excellent a Church as ours is: The&s;e Men do therefore fright them&s;elves and you with meer &s;hadows, and they know be&s;t what Ends they would &s;erve in &s;o doing: But do not, I be|&s;eech you, &s;uffer your &s;elves to be frighted or exa&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rated by their hard Speeches: We have no de&s;ign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;ire to break in upon your Liberty, or impo&s;e up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you; nay, we do not de&s;ire you to conform to our

<P>I own, and ble&s;s GOD for it, the generality of your Mini&s;ters are Men of a better Spirit, and will not <HI>run into the &s;ame exce&s;s of Riot</HI> with this Stranger in <HI>&s;peaking Evil of us;</HI> and many of them I know to be &s;en&s;ible and ingenious Men, and of a good chri&s;tian catholic Spirit, with whom I do, and &s;hall conver&s;e, with the &s;ame freedom, friend&s;hip and good-will, as with any of my Brethren of the Church; and I do aver that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Difference in Opinion ever did, or &s;hall alienate my Affections from any of them: And I can't but won|der, that they would &s;uffer &s;uch a me&s;s of Bil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">insgate-Scolding to be printed, or that they can any of them &s;tomach to vend it about among their People: I am &s;ure they hurt them&s;elves by it, and I am &s;orry for them, and for you, that you are in danger of being impo&s;ed upon by it, tho' I cannot think it will even|tually hurt the Church: It breaths nothing of the Engli&s;h Spirit; it is all over Outlandi&s;h: Had I had any of your own Writers to deal with, I &s;hould hope to have been treated in a more Gentleman-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ike, and chri&s;tian Manner; however, I have not found my &s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to be put out of humour by it, and I can a&s;|&s;ure you, that all the Pa&s;&s;ion it ever rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in me, is that of <HI>Pity</HI> for him, that he &s;hould be &s;o unhappily en&s;laved to his own Pa&s;&s;ions and Prejudice.</P>
<P>The only In&s;tance wherein he can have any face to pretend that I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf har&s;hly is, (as he will have it,) that I called your Teacher a <HI>blind Guide,</HI> and then launches out in a great Commenda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of him, which, I a&s;&s;ure you, I don't envy him; I rather wi&s;h for his &s;ake it had been given him by a Per&s;on
<PB N="5" REF="003784_0007_10025A9FAF6F0160">
of a more E&s;tabli&s;hed Reputation that it might have been a Credit to him. &mdash; But he is very wrong to repre&s;ent me as calling <HI>Him,</HI> in particular, <HI>a blind Guide:</HI> All that I did was to exhort you in our Savio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s Words to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> he Danger there is, le&s;t, <HI>if the blind lead the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> both fall into the Ditch,</HI> i. e. into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rror, which certainly is the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e, be they who they will, who lead, and are led, into &s;uch a wrong and bitter Notion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;uch an uncharitable Temper towards it: But I applyed it to no-body: let Them take it to whom it belongs: That there are blind or ignorant Guides in all Communi|ons, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e will deny, and it was our Saviour's Intenti|on, (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that and that only, was mine,) to exhort the People to be upon their Guard, to look out care|fully and &s;ee with their own Eyes, and not to pin their Faith upon any Mans Sleeve, nor be blindly led on into Error by ignorant and de&s;igning Men, be they who they will: This was all that I did, and pray where was the Crime of it?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h your Teachers were, &s;ome of them, more &s;tudious, and more knowing than they are; and it wou'd be well for them and you too, if, (as &s;ome of them do,) they would all read the excellent Writers of our Church: For I find that tho&s;e of your Prea|chers that are mo&s;t acquainted with our D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ines, are the mo&s;t admired by your &s;elves, and that the more knowing any of them, or their People, are, the better tempered they are towards the Church; and you may depend upon it, that in proportion as true Knowledge increa&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Country, a Veneration for the Church of <HI>England</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll increa&s;e, and that the mo&s;t bitter and cen&s;orious will ever be found the mo&s;t ignorant.</P>
<P>But to come a little nearer to our Controverti&s;t: I will fir&s;t make two or three general Remarks on his unfair Management in this Controver&s;y. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> One is,
<PB N="6" REF="003784_0008_10025AA317357F70">
that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eem to defend the Con&s;titution of the Churches of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Country, and you are apt to take it, that it is your Cau&s;e he is pleading, whereas it is the Presbyterian Kir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> really has at Heart, and aims at, at the bottom; and the Truth is, he drives as really a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an Innovation in the Country, as I can be &s;uppo&s;ed to do: It is not the Cau&s;e of the Congregational Principles of this Country that he is after, but what he calls <HI>the glorious Zenith of Presbytery, p.</HI> 16. and to gild over his De&s;ign the better, he calls you Presbyterians, and &s;peaks as tho' Presbyteriani&s;m was <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> in the&s;e Governments, <HI>p.</HI> 2. whereas every body that knows any thing of the matter, mu&s;t know, that the Principles &amp; Practices of this Country are, in many things, very remote from Presbyteriani&s;m. It is well known that the generality of our Fore-fathers were Independents or <HI>Browni&s;ts,</HI> and he him&s;elf owns, <HI>p.</HI> 12. that he has as much aver&s;ion to <HI>Browni&s;m</HI> as to <HI>Pre|lacy.</HI> He di&s;likes your <HI>Church-Government,</HI> and owns your <HI>Relations</HI> and <HI>Church-Covenants, p.</HI> 28. and your <HI>not reading the Scriptures</HI> to be <HI>Errors, p.</HI> 35. So that he is really an Enemy to the Cau&s;e he would be tho't to defend.</P>
<P>In the next place, he is very unfair in ob&s;erving &s;o often, and making &s;uch a Triumph of it, that I &s;ay &s;ome things without proving of them, when he knows that I never armed nor pretended to prove every thing in the Compa&s;s of two or three Sheets of Paper, and that it was one De&s;ign of my Letter to invite you as Lovers of Truth and fair Inquirers, to give me oppor|tunity in Conver&s;ation to prove &s;everal Things that I did not pretend to prove in &s;o little a Compa&s;s: and yet this mean Artifice is u&s;ed to repre&s;ent as tho' I had proved nothing at all: Tho you will find by what follows, that there were many things, and tho&s;e the mo&s;t important, which I did prove, and he has not, to &s;everal of them, &s;o much as attempted an An|&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003784_0009_10025AA49D5FDA08">La&s;tly, when I expre&s;s my Di&s;like of the Temper of &s;ome of your Treachers towards the Church, and e&s;pe|cially their &s;cattering abroad &s;everal Books, which &s;et it in a very fal&s;e and odious Light, he is very injurious in repre&s;enting me, <HI>p.</HI> 15. &amp;c. as tho' I condemned them all in a lump, as &s;o many <HI>Seducers, Deluders, Ene|mies of GOD, Crucifiers of Chri&s;t,</HI> and I know not what: I am &s;ure there is nothing in my Letter that can be ju&s;tly interpreted to bear &s;uch a meaning.

<P>And now to begin with this Pamphlet, and take things in Cour&s;e. &mdash; The fir&s;t thing he objects again&s;t me is, that I call you <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and <HI>my Pari&s;honers;</HI> and he will have that we of <HI>the Church</HI> rather are <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters in this Country,</HI> where he &s;ays <HI>the Presbyterians are the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, p.</HI> 2. &mdash; To all which I an&s;wer thus, &mdash; That you are my Pari&s;hioners, is as true, as it is that I am appointed Mini&s;ter of this Town and the Places adjacent, by the Honourable Society incor|porated by Royal Charter for providing Mini&s;ters for the Plantations, and by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> to whom the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government of them is committed

where a Duty is enjoyned, the contrary Sin is forbidden.</HI> This I allow to be a good Rule, and own, that hence it follows that we may not teach any thing for a nece&s;&s;ary Doctrine of Chri&s;t, which he hath not taught and commanded us to teach as &s;uch. &mdash; But does it hence follow, that Government may not en|joyn, for Public Order, &s;ome things which are decla|red in their own Nature to be indifferent, and only required for external Order and Decency? No &s;uch matter: So far from this, that Chri&s;t requires <HI>we &s;hould not only render to GOD the things that are his,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>to</HI> Cae&s;ar, the Civil Magi&s;trate, <HI>the things that are his,</HI> Mat. 22.21.

This Rule therefore concludes nothing a|gain&s;t us, unle&s;s he will &s;ay that our Saviour's mean|ing when he commands us to obey him, is, that he for|bids us to obey even lawful Government in things not forbidden by him: This would be fine Divinity in|deed&punc; What can this mean, but that it is utterly unlaw|ful to obey humane Authority, even where Chri&s;t hath not interpo&s;ed?

But as to reading them in Public, it is true we are not required by the Church, (nor is there any Rea&s;on, why we &s;hould) to read all the Parts of Scripture in the Time of Publick Wor&s;hip; and I believe any Body would think it very abu&s;ive to fault any Church for not reading many parts of it, &s;uch as hard Names of Pla|ces, Genealogies, and very ob&s;cure Prophe&s;ies, and the like: Such Parts of it, tho' on many Occa&s;ions, they are very u&s;eful, yet it is no di&s;repect to them to &s;ay that they are le&s;s edifying to the common People, than the Books of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus.</HI>&mdash; But as to the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> it is only &s;ome part of it that is to be read, and we are not required to read one Syllable of it on the Lord's-Day, tho' if we were, it would be much more edifying than any thing this great Preacher could offer. &mdash; Now I will put it to your own Con&s;ciences, do you really think that &s;uch Rea&s;ons as the&s;e will ju&s;tify a Separation from the Church E&s;tabli&s;hed in our Nation, <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e they don't read hard Names and ob|&s;cure Prophe&s;ies in Publick on the Lord's Day, and becau&s;e they read &s;ome excellent parts of the <HI>Apo|crypha,</HI> (tho' not as canonical Scripture,) on Week-Days?</P>

Re&s;olutions as become that holy Duty; but further than the&s;e, we can &s;ee no &s;en&s;e in this Notion of praying by the Spirit he pleads for. &mdash; Upon the whole, it is really a melancholy thing to hear you forever talking of pure Wor&s;hip, and again&s;t the Inven|tions of Men, when at the &s;ame time, your Wor&s;hip is little el&s;e but Man's Invention: For pray con&s;ider, what have you in your Service, but an extempore Prayer and a Sermon, and the&s;e you can't but &s;ee, are your Mini&s;ters Invention, unle&s;s you will &s;ay, as &s;ome Quakers do, that they are as much the Word of GOD as the Bible: You &s;ing, it is true, two or three Ver&s;es of the P&s;alms, but they are turned into Metre, and this together with the Tunes you u&s;e, are but Humane Inventions, and of late date too: And one would think you don't &s;ing as an Act of Wor&s;hip, for then, &s;ure you would &s;tand up: The Ble&s;&s;ing, it is true, is taken from Scripture, but then you have generally &s;omething added to it to mend it. This, my Brethren, is your pure Wor&s;hip, for which you have turned out &s;everal Divine Appointments, &s;uch as the Lord's Prayer, reading the Scripture, the People's bearing a part, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For your further Satis|faction, read, Bp. <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Inventions of Men in the Wor|&s;hip of GOD.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Another Thing I told you wherein you appea|red to me to vary from the Scripture-way of Wor&s;hip, is, <HI>That the People do not bear a part in your publick Wor|&s;hip.</HI> And here he &s;ays, <HI>We do allow them all that the Word of God, and the Examples therein, allow them. p.</HI> 39. Now would to God this were true, for we de&s;ire no more: But alas! What can be more contrary to Truth? for any Man, with but half an Eye, may &s;ee that the Word of GOD and the Examples therein, allow and require the People to join their Voices in &s;peak|ing the Public Prayers and Prai&s;es: Thus, be&s;ides the Texts I mentioned before, &s;ee <HI>Judges</HI> 21.2. <HI>The
<PB N="59" REF="003784_0061_10025B21217C7AB0">
People came to the Hou&s;e of God, and lift up their Voices, and wept &s;ore, and &s;aid, O Lord God of I&s;rael, why is this come to pa&s;s in I&s;rael, &amp;c.</HI> And 2 Chron. 7.2. <HI>The People bowed them&s;elves with their Faces to the Ground upon the Pavement, and wor&s;hipped and prai&s;ed the Lord, &s;aying, He is Good, for his Mercy endureth forever.</HI>&mdash; Nehem. 8.6. <HI>And Ezra ble&s;&s;ed the Lord, the great God, and all the People an&s;wered and &s;aid,</HI> Amen, Amen, <HI>with lifting up their Hands and they bowed their Heads and wor&s;hipped the Lord, with their Faces towards the Ground.</HI> Yea, There is an expre&s;s Command for it, in P&s;al. 106.48. <HI>Let all the People &s;ay,</HI> Amen. And in like man|ner, in the New-Te&s;tament, it is plain from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.16. That the <HI>unlearned</HI> had a <HI>vocal</HI> part a&s;&s;igned them in the Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;emblies, &s;o from <HI>Rev</HI> 19, 6. To which he made no Reply, and yet had the Courage to charge this Scripture Way of Wor&s;hip with Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But let us take a view of his Comment on two Texts that I mentioned to prove this Point; one was <HI>Acts</HI> 4.24. <HI>They lift up their Voice with one accord, and &s;aid,</HI> &amp;c. Now, &s;ays he, it is evident <HI>this was a &s;inging Voice:</HI> Sure he is a bold Man, thus to contradict the Holy Gho&s;t: The Spirit of GOD &s;ays, <HI>they &s;aid</HI> this Prayer: It is no &s;uch thing, &s;ays <HI>J. G.</HI> they <HI>&s;ung</HI> it: Well, Let us &s;ee how he proves it? Why, &s;ays he, <HI>It is evident that part of this Prayer was part of the &s;econd P&s;alm:</HI> Here now is Demon&s;tration! Not a Word more to be &s;aid! for you know it is impo&s;&s;ible to u&s;e one Sentence out of the P&s;alms without Singing. Had this Man ever been at Church, he would have &s;een this Argument con&s;uted for there we u&s;e whole P&s;alms together without Singing: and I pray does he never u&s;e a Sentence taken out of the P&s;alms in Prayer? and does he always &s;ing his Prayers? &mdash; I can't leave this terrible Argument without taking Notice of a flat Contradiction: He had &s;aid but the Page before, <HI>That the Apo&s;tles did not u&s;e</HI> either <HI>David</HI>'s, or
<PB N="60" REF="003784_0062_10025B22A814D958">
<HI>Solomon</HI>'s or <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s Prayers, yet here in the very next Page he tells us, that <HI>part of</HI> this Prayer which the Apo&s;tles u&s;ed was <HI>the expre&s;s Words of the &s;econd P&s;alm,</HI> which <HI>David</HI> compo&s;ed. This verifies the Proverb, <HI>They that tell two Stories, need have a good Me|mory:</HI> But it is no wonder a Man &s;hould contradict him&s;elf that makes bold to contradict his Maker; nor is it any wonder that a Man &s;hould plead for un|premeditated Prayers, that Writes without any Pre|meditation or Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>He next falls upon <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.6. where we are com|manded <HI>with one Mind, and one Mouth to glorify our heavenly Father,</HI>&mdash; And &s;ays he, <HI>this one Morth is the Mini&s;ters Mouth, p.</HI> 40. &mdash; Very fine! And why not the <HI>one Mind</HI> the Mini&s;ters Mind too? and then the People have nothing at all to do, and may e'en go to Sleep, or go home and leave the Mini&s;ter to pray for them, for he can do it, according to Mr. <HI>J. G</HI>'s &s;en&s;e, <HI>with one Mind and one Mouth,</HI> as well without them as with them: Now we take it, that as the <HI>one Mind</HI> &s;ignifies the Minds of all the Congregation, united in thinking the &s;ame thing, &s;o the <HI>one Mouth</HI> means the Mouths of all the Congregation, as it were with <HI>one Voice</HI> &s;aying the &s;ame thing. &mdash; He then propunds two or three childi&s;h Que&s;tions: One is, <HI>Why don't your People joyn in reading the Le&s;&s;ons,</HI> i. e. Chapters, <HI>as well as the P&s;alms?</HI> I an&s;wer, becau&s;e when other Parts of the Scripture are read, GOD is therein &s;peaking to the People, and therefore it is proper for the Mini&s;ter alone to read it, as <HI>Ezra</HI> did, in <HI>Neh.</HI> 8.3. And it was but a little before he had &s;aid, that in Scripture-times, <HI>One read</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>and the Prophets, and all the People did not read with an audible Voice, in a mo&s;t confu&s;ed manner,</HI> as if we did &s;o: Whereas we in this conform exactly to the Scripture Pattern: But now he has forgot him&s;elf, and asks why don't the People read a part of the Le&s;&s;ons? &mdash; But on
<PB N="61" REF="003784_0063_10025B2442627170">
the other hand, the P&s;alms are Prayers and Prai&s;es, or Addre&s;&s;es to GOD, and therefore all our People joyn in &s;aying and &s;inging them. &mdash; He next asks, <HI>By what Rule do Women thus &s;peak in the Church?</HI> I an|&s;wer, pray by what Rule do Women &s;ing in your Meetings? There is as good warrant for one as the other, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.5. where the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of Wo|men <HI>praying and prophe&s;ying,</HI> or &s;inging&punc; as Mr. <HI>Mead</HI> ju&s;tly interprets it. Tho' the Apo&s;tle forbad them <HI>to teach or u&s;urp Authority over the Man,</HI> 1. Tim. 2 12. Yet he never forbad them to joyn with the Congre|gation in praying and prai&s;ing GOD. Now I hope the&s;e Difficulties <HI>are removed,</HI> and our Wor&s;hip <HI>wholly cleared from Confu&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>And now I am on this head of the Peoples part in Public Wor&s;hip, I will vindicate what I alledged to prove it their Duty to &s;ay <HI>Amen</HI> vocally: I produced &s;everal Texts out of both the Old and New Te&s;ta|ment, which are as full to the purpo&s;e as Words can be, &s;ome of which I mentioned above. Now ob&s;erve how ea&s;ily he turns them off: &mdash;He &s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 42. <HI>My multiplied Quotations prove no more than that the People &s;hould &s;ay</HI> Amen <HI>privately.</HI> I confe&s;s, I am much at a lo&s;s to know what he means by &s;aying <HI>Amen</HI> privately, unle&s;s it be to &s;ay <HI>Amen</HI> &s;ilently, <HI>i. e.</HI> to &s;peak and at the &s;ame time &s;ay nothing at all: This is quite as good as the <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;ilent Meetings, which they &s;ay are mo&s;t edifying. But I intreat you to con&s;ider, That to a&s;&s;ent to a Public Prayer in my Heart is one thing, and openly to te&s;tifie this A&s;&s;ent by &s;aying <HI>Amen</HI> is another, and that GOD requires the latter as well as the former. &mdash; It is a dangerous thing to make <HI>a No&s;e of Wax</HI> of the Scripture, as he does on this, and many other Subjects; thus when GOD requires us to <HI>confe&s;s with the Mouth,</HI> as well as to <HI>believe with the Heart,</HI> Rom. 10.9, 10. to &s;ay <HI>Amen</HI> as well as to <HI>think</HI> it, for a poor &s;illy Mortal to &s;tart up and &s;ay, <HI>it is Confu&s;ion,</HI> and it is more decent to &s;ay
<PB N="62" REF="003784_0064_10025B2685D7C9E0">
it <HI>privately,</HI> &amp;c. How intolerably pre&s;uming is this? If this Method will do, the <HI>Quakers</HI> mu&s;t never be condemned for rejecting outward Bapti&s;m, and the outward Lord's Supper, &s;o long as they can &s;ay they receive them inwardly. &mdash; La&s;tly, Whereas he re|pre&s;ents us here as &s;aying <HI>Amen twenty or thirty Times in reading the &s;ame Prayers.</HI> &mdash; I pray what People do &s;o? I am &s;ure the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;ay <HI>Amen</HI> but once to one Prayer. &mdash; To u&s;e his own Words, <HI>How hateful are &s;uch &s;landerous In&s;inuation?</HI> &mdash; Upon the whole, I can't but think, Brethren, you had but a hard Bargain of it, when you were per&s;uaded to give up your mo&s;t valuable ancient Scripture Privilege of bearing a vocal part of the Public Prayers and Prai&s;es, and in&s;tead thereof are allowed the Liberty of holding up your Hand to Vote in every trifling Affair of Church Di&s;cipline: I would therefore wi&s;h you to re&s;ume that your ancient Privilege again.</P>
<P N="8">8. Another thing wherein you appeared to me to have gone off from Scripture Rule and Example, was your Neglect of <HI>bodily Wor&s;hip,</HI> which I proved to be your Duty from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.20. where we are required <HI>to glorifie GOD with our Bodies, as well as our Spirits.</HI> Particularly I proved <HI>Kneeling</HI> in your Prayers and other Services to be your Duty from the Command, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 95.6. and the Apo&s;tles Example in <HI>Acts</HI> 20.36. nay, Chri&s;t him&s;elf <HI>Kneeled, Luk.</HI> 22.41. To this he makes no Reply, only gives an ill-natured Flout, which de&s;erves no notice. &mdash; I mentioned <HI>Bowing</HI> at the Name of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as a proper Token of our Submi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> as our Lord and King, our Saviour and our GOD, in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Arian</HI> and <HI>Socinian</HI> Here&s;ies, and as being &s;uffi|ciently ju&s;tified to be lawful from <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.10. His only bu&s;ine&s;s in An&s;wer to this, was to prove that it is inexpedient or unlawful: In&s;tead of which he pre|tends to a little <HI>Greek,</HI> and &s;ays it might be rendered
<PB N="63" REF="003784_0065_10025B2BBA9E5900">
<HI>in the Name,</HI> But I &s;ay if it was &s;o rendered, it would not be &s;o ju&s;tly rendered as it is now, and for this I appeal to the Critics, and to the Scope of the Apo&s;tle in that Context. As for his Que&s;tions that follow, about doing it but once, and to the Ea&s;t, they are meer Quibbles, and I am not at all concerned to An|&s;wer them, if they de&s;erved any Notice, as indeed they do not. &mdash; I will only &s;ay, that it is then mo&s;t proper to expre&s;s our Adoration of him when we confe&s;s our Faith in him, and that we do in all other parts of our Wor&s;hip, offer up our Addre&s;&s;es to GOD <HI>in the Name</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as well as you.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t material Objection you have again&s;t us on this head is our <HI>Kneeling at the Sacrament;</HI> and as to this, I gave you as briefly as I could, the Rea&s;ons of our Practice: One Rea&s;on I gave you was this, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Lord's Supper is the mo&s;t &s;olemn Act of Wor&s;hip that we can perform, and Kneeling is the proper and Scripture Po&s;ture of Wor&s;hip. &mdash; To which this <HI>Remarker</HI> makes no reply at all: And the Rea&s;on doubtle&s;s was, becau&s;e he was not able, for he promi&s;ed at fir&s;t &s;etting out, that he would <HI>do</HI> his <HI>ut|mo&s;t, p.</HI> 2. &mdash; And becau&s;e you commonly think that Chri&s;t gave this Sacrament to his Apo&s;tles, Sitting, I ob&s;erved to you, that this was a mi&s;take, for the Ta|ble po&s;ture in Chri&s;t's Time was <HI>Leaning;</HI> and there|fore in <HI>Sitting</HI> at it, you can't pretend to conform to the manner of the fir&s;t In&s;titution. This al&s;o he takes no Notice of; for An&s;wering was not his De&s;ign, but Quibbling.</P>
<P>He indeed tells us that it was fir&s;t admini&s;tred in a Table-Po&s;ture, but dare not tell what Table-Po&s;ture he means, for that would have &s;poiled all: nor does he vouch&s;afe to give us the lea&s;t Proof of this bold A&s;&s;ertion; for altho' it be ea&s;y to affirm, yet it is im|po&s;&s;ible to prove that it was fir&s;t admini&s;tred in <HI>any</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="003784_0066_10025B2D42CEC7D0">
Table-Po&s;ture: And yet he immediately brings a mo&s;t terrible Charge again&s;t me as being guilty of a <HI>mo&s;t horrid Reflection on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, p.</HI> 41. becau&s;e I &s;aid&punc; how &s;candalou&s;ly indecent is it to receive this Seal of our Pardon, &s;itting?&mdash; But why &s;o ha&s;ty, Friend? What makes you think it <HI>a mo&s;t horrid Reflection</HI> on our Lord? This is, in effect, to charge me with Bla&s;phemy!&mdash; Do you really think it as horrid a Reflection, as that of the Phari&s;ees, who &s;aid our Saviour <HI>had a Devil?</HI> Or was there never a <HI>Jew, Turk</HI> or <HI>Pagan,</HI> that ca&s;t a more horrid Reflection on Chri&s;t? Why then, in the &s;uperlative Degree?&mdash; However, Brethren, being arraigned at your Bar for no le&s;s a Crime than Bla&s;phem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which is what mu&s;t be implyed in <HI>mo&s;t horridly reflecting</HI> on Chri&s;t, I plead <HI>not Guilty;</HI> and to acquit my &s;elf, I will prove, That it is &s;candalou&s;ly indecent to receive the Seal of our Pardon, Sitting; and that to &s;ay &s;o, is no horrid Re|flection on our Saviour, becau&s;e it does not appear that he gave it to his Di&s;ciples, Sitting.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Propo&s;itions I argue thus: It is a Rule allowed by all; and the Counterpart of it this very Man pretends to, That <HI>Tho&s;e Commands in the Decalogue, which forbid a Sin, do at the &s;ame Time re|quire the Contrary Duty:</HI> Thus when the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Command|ment forbids us to acknowledge any <HI>fal&s;e Gods,</HI> it does oblige us to acknowledge the <HI>True God:</HI> So when the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Commandment forbids us to <HI>bow down</HI> to fal&s;e Gods and <HI>&s;erve them;</HI> it obliges us to practi&s;e the contrary Duties in our Addre&s;&s;es to the true GOD, <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>bow down to Him</HI> and <HI>&s;erve Him: i e.</HI> To wor&s;hip Him both with our Bodies and Minds.&mdash;Therefore as he that either bows or kneels, or u&s;es any other Po&s;ture of Reverence to a graven Image, breaks the &s;econd Commandment, &s;o does he who in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Act of Wor&s;hip, (&s;uch as receiving the Lord's-Supper,) refu&s;es to u&s;e &s;ome &s;uch Po&s;ture of
<PB N="65" REF="003784_0067_10025B2ED52AC320">
Wor&s;hip to GOD: for it is a Contempt of GOD to addre&s;s his Infinite Maje&s;ty without &s;ome Po&s;ture of Adoration, as well as a Sin to kneel to an Image, tho' without praying to it, as the Papi&s;ts pretend to do: The one is Idolatry, the other Sacrilege; for the Rea&s;on why we are forbid to bow down to an Idol, is becau&s;e it is an Act of Wor&s;hip due to GOD, and whether we give to an Image what is due to GOD, or refu&s;e to pay it to Him, we are equally Robbers of GOD, we deny Him His Honour, and are guilty of Sacrilege.&mdash; I be&s;eech you, my Brethren, con&s;ider this without Prejudice: I know you <HI>abhor Idolatry;</HI> pray <HI>do not commit Sacrilege,</HI> Rom. 2.22. &mdash; I before urged this po&s;itive Command to you, from <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 95.6. <HI>O come let us Wor&s;hip and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.</HI> Now if ever we would bow our Knees to our Maker, we ought, &s;urely, to do it then, when we come to Him in the neare&s;t Approaches that we are capable of in this World, and with the highe&s;t Sen&s;e of Gratitude that our Son's can admit of, to remember and adore Him for the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing In&s;tance of Love that could be be&s;towed on us, even <HI>giving his own Son to die for us:</HI> Certainly if it be not our Duty to kneel before GOD on this mo&s;t &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, it is hard to &s;ay when we are obliged to it: And he that can &s;o far di&s;regard this po&s;itive Command of GOD, as to &s;it down in this neare&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olemn Approach to him, no doubt but he may with as good Rea&s;on &s;it in every other part of Wor|&s;hip, and &s;o never bow his Knee to GOD, or give Him any Bodily Wor&s;hip, thro' the whole Cour&s;e of his Life.</P>
<P>And as Sitting at the Lord's Table is a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Po&s;itive Law of GOD; &s;o it is likewi&s;e con|trary to all the Rules of Decency among Men: for this I appeal to any Man's Con&s;cience: Suppo&s;e that for &s;ome grievous Crime you were ju&s;tly condemned to die, and when you were come to the Place of Ex|ecution,

the King being pre&s;ent, &s;hould hold out a Pardon to you; I ask in what Po&s;ture would you receive it? Would you &s;it on your back-&s;ide and take it? No, certainly, you would fall on your Knees with the deepe&s;t Gratitude:&mdash; And will you be more unmannerly to GOD than towards Man? &mdash; You know that in the Lord's Supper, the Bread and Wine repre&s;ent the Body and Blood of Chri&s;t, who&s;e Death is the alone Foundation of our Pardon: And as the Mini&s;ter delivers you this holy Bread and Wine, &s;o GOD at the &s;ame Time gives you Chri&s;t, and the Ble&s;&s;ings He has purcha&s;ed. &mdash; Now <HI>does not even Nature teach</HI> (as St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays in another Ca&s;e,) that <HI>it is a Shame</HI> to receive our Saviour, Sitting, as tho' we were his Companions rather than his Subjects: But I proved before, that we are to con&s;ider our Saviour now as being in a different Capacity from what he was while on Earth: Then he was in the <HI>Form of a Servant,</HI> but Now He is <HI>King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</HI> and GOD hath commanded even <HI>His Angels to wor&s;hip Him, Heb.</HI> 1.6. <HI>Rev.</HI> 19.16.

The <HI>Pope</HI> indeed conceiting him&s;elf Chri&s;t's Vicar, looks upon it as his Privilege to &s;it at the Sacrament; and pray con&s;ider, whether it does not look like Symbolizing with him for you to do &s;o? &mdash;I add <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> on this Head, &mdash; We find St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;everely reproved the <HI>Corinthians</HI> for their irrevence in receiving the Sacrament, and threatned them with <HI>Damnation</HI> for their <HI>not di&s;cerning the Lord's Body,</HI> 1 Cor. 11.29. i. e.

<P>It is pleaded on your &s;ide, That if Chri&s;t gave this Sacrament to His Apo&s;tles, Sitting, then it is lawful at lea&s;t, for us &s;o to receive it.&mdash; I an&s;wer, It is a great Mi&s;take to think that Chri&s;t gave it to his Di&s;ciples, Sitting: For every Man that has but the &s;malle&s;t Ac|quaintance with the Original, and the Cu&s;toms of tho&s;e Times, mu&s;t know that they did not &s;it down as we do now, but lay down on Couches, &s;o that their Feet came behind each other, and they <HI>leaned on</HI> each others <HI>Brea&s;t, John</HI> 21.20. &mdash; Well, but &s;ay you, this was a <HI>Table-Po&s;ture,</HI> &mdash; I an&s;wer, We have no Rea&s;on to think that Chri&s;t gave this Sacrament to his Di&s;ciples while they continued in this Po&s;ture.

We there find that after they had eaten the <HI>Supper of unleavened Bread,</HI> which was called the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over,</HI> (but not the <HI>Pa&s;chal Lamb,</HI> for that was not killed till the next Day, and that by the Prie&s;t at the Temple,) I &s;ay, after this Supper was over, <HI>Chri&s;t took Bread, and gave Thanks and Ble&s;&s;ed it:</HI> Now you cannot think, that the Apo&s;tles conti|nued in that Po&s;ture, while Chri&s;t was giving Thanks, and <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> or <HI>Praying:</HI> &mdash; If you think they did &s;o, Why don't you &s;it &s;till or lie down, while your Mini&s;ter is praying over the Bread and Wine? No, you think they ro&s;e up and put them&s;elves into a wor&s;hipping Po&s;ture, or el&s;e how dare you do &s;o? So that it is plain, and your own Practice &s;hews you believe that neither Chri&s;t nor his Di&s;ciples did con|tinue in a Table-Po&s;ture, but put them&s;elves into a Wor&s;hipping-Po&s;ture, when this Sacrament was in|&s;tituted.&mdash;If you &s;ay. None of the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> take No|tice of their ri&s;ing up from the Table to Pray and give
<PB N="68" REF="003784_0070_10025B36CD8F5040">
Thanks, &mdash; I an&s;wer, neither was there any need of it, &s;ince the change of Action from eating to gi|ving Thanks, does &s;ufficiently &s;ignifie and infer a Change of Po&s;ture. Neither <HI>Matthew</HI> nor <HI>Mark</HI> nor <HI>Luke</HI> mention Chri&s;t's Changing his Po&s;ture, from the Time that they fir&s;t &s;at down that Evening, till they aro&s;e to go into the Garden, and yet it is certain that they did ri&s;e up and &s;it down again after Supper, <HI>John</HI> 13 4. &amp;c. &mdash; Now if Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles did ri&s;e to pray over the Bread and Wine, (which you mu&s;t own, or condemn your &s;elves,) then pray tell me where you find that they &s;at down again to receive it after it was con&s;ecrated? If Mr. <HI>J. G.</HI> can do this, then I will own my Guilt, but till this be done, which I am &s;ure no Man can do that has not another Bible than I have, I mu&s;t look on him as a fal&s;e Accu&s;er. &mdash; I intreat you therefore, my Bre|thren, no longer to entertain that Notion, which has no foundation in the Bible, that Chri&s;t gave this Sacrament to his Di&s;ciples, &s;itting; nor is there one In&s;tance in all that holy Book, of one good Man that Wor&s;hipped GOD, in that indecent Po&s;ture, and it is contrary to many expre&s;s Commands that injoyn Bodily Wor&s;hip, as I &s;hewed you before.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>J. G.</HI> tells you <HI>that kneeling at the Sacrament had its ri&s;e from tho&s;e that adore the Elements.</HI> I an&s;wer, It is true he &s;ays &s;o, and that is all: Intreat him in his next to prove it, and a great many more untruths that he has confidently a&s;&s;erted. &mdash; I am &s;ure Mr. <HI>Bingham</HI> in his <HI>Orig. Eccle&s;. l.</HI> 15. makes it evident, That the Primitive Church never u&s;ed the Po&s;ture of Sitting at the Sacrament, and that they always u&s;ed a Po&s;ture of Adoration, either Standing or Kneeling. He quotes among others St. <HI>Cyril,</HI> who&s;e Words are the&s;e, <Q>Approach, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> not rudely, but bowing thy &s;elf, and in a Po&s;ture of Wor&s;hip and Adora|tion, &s;aying <HI>Amen.</HI></Q> Now St. <HI>Cyril</HI> lived in the Year 350, whereas <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation</HI> and <HI>Adoring the

So that an adoring Po&s;ture was certainly u&s;ed, at lea&s;t above 800 Years, be|fore Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; &s;o far from Truth is what he here a&s;&s;erts! &mdash; But &s;uppo&s;ing, (not granting,) that it was &s;o, does that make it unlawful for tho&s;e to kneel that have no de&s;ign or thought of adoring the Elements? Pray look into our <HI>Rubric</HI> in the end of the <HI>Communion-Service;</HI> and then charge us with adoring the Elements if you can. And why is it not as good to &s;ymbolize with the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> in u&s;ing a reverent Po&s;ture, as with the <HI>Arians</HI> or <HI>Socinians</HI> in an irreverent one. The <HI>Arians,</HI> or rather <HI>Socinians,</HI> who deny Chri&s;t's Divinity, fir&s;t brought in that in|decent Practice of Sitting at the Lord's Supper, be|cau&s;e they thought it unlawful to wor&s;hip Chri&s;t: I don't de&s;ire you to take this upon my bare Word, as he does what he &s;ays, but I will give you the very Words of the Prote&s;tant Church in <HI>Poland:</HI> The Words of their genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Synod are the&s;e, &mdash; <Q>Tho&s;e traiterous Fugitives from us to <HI>Ariani&s;m,</HI> were the fir&s;t Authors among us of Sitting at the Lord's Table, contrary to the Rites u&s;ed in all the Refor|med Churches throughout <HI>Europe;</HI> we therefore reject this Ceremony as indecent and irreligious.</Q> &mdash; You &s;ee they thought Sitting indecent and ir|religious as well as the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and they tell us it was not u&s;ed by any Prote&s;tant Church in their Time.

<PB N="75" REF="003784_0077_10025B482A8D6AD8">
That in denying Ab&s;olute Reprobation he denys his own Articles, and therefore with what Face can he charge me with denying any of the Articles of the Church. &mdash; That he denys his own Articles in denying Ab&s;olute Reprobation, is evident: For the&s;e are the Words of your <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI>'s <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith</HI> which he has a&s;&s;ented to, <HI>p.</HI> 20, 21, &mdash; <Q>GOD hath not Decreed any thing becau&s;e he fore&s;aw it as future, or would come to pa&s;s upon &s;uch Condi|tions.</Q> And <Q>By the Decree of GOD, for the Manife&s;tation of his Glory, &s;ome Men and Angels are prede&s;tinated to everla&s;ting Life, and others are fore-ordained to everla&s;ting Death.</Q> And <Q>the&s;e Angels and Men thus prede&s;tinated and or|dained are particularly and unchangeably de&s;igned, and their number &s;o certain and definite, that it cannot be either encrea&s;ed or dimini&s;hed.</Q> &mdash; You &s;ee it is plain from the&s;e Words of your Con|fe&s;&s;ion, that they are <HI>particularly, unchangeably</HI> and <HI>unconditionally,</HI> or ab&s;olutely, <HI>ordained,</HI> &s;ome <HI>to ever|la&s;ting Life,</HI> and others <HI>to everla&s;ting Death,</HI> and not <HI>becau&s;e GOD fore&s;aw</HI> &s;uch or <HI>&s;uch Conditions;</HI> either Holine&s;s in the one, or Sin in the other. &mdash; So that, as I &s;aid in denying ab&s;olute Reprobation, he plainly denys his own Articles; let him therefore hereafter forbear charging others with denying theirs. &mdash; But the other Remark I would make here, is, That he is not only incon&s;i&s;tent with his Articles, but al&s;o with him&s;elf. For he had &s;aid ju&s;t before, that in GOD's Decrees. <HI>He con&s;ulted the Coun&s;el of His own Will, and not the Wills of any of his Creatures.</HI>&mdash; Whereas, If he decreed the Reprobate <HI>to Damnation for Sin,</HI> as he owns here, and if <HI>they fall into Sin by their own Wills,</HI> as he here al&s;o &s;ays, it is plain that GOD in ordaining them to Damnation mu&s;t have had an Eye at their Wills in making this Decree. &mdash; So apt are tho&s;e on that &s;ide to run into Contra|dictions

Bangor:</HI> &mdash; Tho' it be tho't needle&s;s to enter upon a very pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ticular Examination of this vain|glorious Triumph, yet it &s;eemed not unnece&s;&s;ary to add here, &s;ome brief Animadver&s;ions of the Author of the&s;e Letters, by way of Reply to it; which are as follows.</P>
<P>It would be almo&s;t endle&s;s, if I &s;hould take Notice of every particular In&s;tance of this Gentleman's un|fair Dealing: He often &s;trains my Expre&s;&s;ions, and tho&s;e of the Authors he quotes, into meanings which neither they nor I ever intended, and then laboriou&s;ly fights with his own Shadow: In other In&s;tances, and tho&s;e very many, he has nothing but a Sett of meer Quibbles, for two or three Pages together: And in others he &s;eems indu&s;triou&s;ly to go be&s;ides the Que&s;|tion, in&s;omuch that I really wi&s;h I could &s;ee for what End he could write, at lea&s;t, half this long-winded Pamphlet, unle&s;s it were purely to amu&s;e his Readers with a tedious Verbo&s;ity, and to &s;ee how much he
<PB N="80" REF="003784_0081_10025B51B12EFCF8">
could &s;ay upon the Subject. &mdash; In &s;uch a captious, quibbling Way of Writing, there is truly &s;carce any thing but what may be an&s;wered: Even the mo&s;t &s;acred Cau&s;es of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> the <HI>Divinity of Chri&s;t,</HI> nay, and <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> it &s;elf, are not without Adver|&s;aries, that can find Art enough to make a plau&s;ible Preten&s;e of an&s;wering. &mdash; With re&s;pect to &s;uch a management it was, that Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> as I remember, &s;ays, &s;omewhere, <Q>He &s;hould never think the wor&s;e of a Book becau&s;e it was pretended to be an&s;wered.</Q>
And as to the Letters under Con&s;ideration, I can't think but I may &s;ay, with, at lea&s;t, as much Ju&s;tice as <HI>Elutherius</HI> does concering his <HI>Dialogues, p.</HI> 2. <Q>That a new Edition of them would be a &s;ufficient Reply to his Invectives.</Q></P>
<P>The main Artifice that runs thro' his Performance, con&s;i&s;ts in producing long and numerous Quotations from &s;everal of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Writers of our Church, e&s;pecially in their Writings again&s;t Popery, which he would have his unwary Readers believe, from a meer Gingle of the Words, to be de&s;tructive to the Cau&s;e of the Church to which they adhered, and which they &s;o admirably defended: As if tho&s;e great Men did not know how to Write con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves; or, as if what we plead for were arrant Popery, and the Arguments and Manner of Speaking they u&s;e, were as much incon&s;i&s;tent with, and &s;ubver&s;ive of what we plead in behalf of Epi&s;co|pacy, as of the great Corruptions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which they impugn. &mdash; Seriou&s;ly I can &s;carce conceive, how this Gentlemen can think him&s;elf in earne&s;t, in the u&s;e he pretends to make of tho&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ages; for there is not a tenth part of all his nume|rous Quotations from <HI>Jewel, Hooker, Chillingworth</HI> and <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> &amp;c. but which take them as they lie in the Authors them&s;elves, and with the Views they had in Writing them, and I do highly approve of them, and
<PB N="81" REF="003784_0082_10025B534FD58B08">
can find nothing in them, that is at all really incon|&s;i&s;tent with what I contend for, nor with the way of Rea&s;oning that I u&s;e. &mdash; They were certainly as great and good Men, and as excellent Defenders of our Church, as ever the Nation bred, and are remar|kable for a prodigious vein of Rea&s;on and Eloquence: And I can't help &s;aying, with re&s;pect to <HI>Hooker</HI> and <HI>Chillingworth</HI> in particular&punc; That it &s;eems to me, the Man who has &s;eriou&s;ly read and con&s;idered, and at the &s;ame Time is not convinced by their mighty Rea|&s;onings in behalf of <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> as well as the other things they contend for, mu&s;t have a Mind of a very &s;trange and odd Sort of make.</P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>Phileleuth.</HI> indeed, pretends <HI>p.</HI> 3. from <HI>Ed|wards</HI>'s Authority, that Mr. <HI>Hooker, l.</HI> 3. held Epi&s;copa|cy was <HI>mutable,</HI> and might be <HI>abrogated;</HI> which is a Specimen of <HI>Edwards</HI>'s u&s;ual abu&s;ive Mi&s;repre&s;entation of his Authors: For the Truth is, Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> is there &s;peaking of Prudential Con&s;titutions, re&s;pecting the <HI>Circum&s;tantials</HI> of the Epi&s;copal Government, and o|ther In&s;titutions of Religion, and not of Epi&s;copacy <HI>it &s;elf,</HI> which he &s;trenuou&s;ly holds to be founded on the Word of GOD, in that very Book, &sect;. <HI>ult.</HI> and the &s;ame is evident from his 7th Book, where he &s;ays, &sect;. 1. (and afterwards abundantly proves it,) <Q>Neither hath Chri&s;tianity been ever Planted in any King|dom throughout the World, but with this kind of Government alone, which to have been ordained of GOD, I am for my own part, as re&s;olutely per|&s;uaded, as that any other kind of Government in the World what&s;oever is of GOD.</Q> &mdash; Could he then think it <HI>mutable</HI> or that it <HI>might be abrogated?</HI> &mdash; What is there that &s;ome People, to &s;erve a Turn, will not &s;ay?</P>
<P>And as to Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s Demon&s;tration of <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> let Mr. <HI>Phileleuth.</HI> &s;ay what he will about
<PB N="82" REF="003784_0083_10025B54D4F1C930">
<HI>Edwards</HI>'s Strictures, and one <HI>Lauder</HI>'s pretended Confutation of it, <HI>p.</HI> 136. I can't yet believe, there ever was, or will be, a ju&s;t Confutation of it; for it really is, what it pretends to be, A Demon&s;tration in it's kind. &mdash; And for this Gen|tleman to pretend, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> in his Mode&s;t Way of &s;peaking mentions Epi&s;copacy, as being <HI>not repugnant to the Government left in the Churches by the Apo&s;tles,</HI> &amp;c. that this is all he undertakes to prove, is very wrong, for he knows that what he under|takes to demon&s;trate, is, that it was really In&s;tituted by the Apo&s;tles, and that it is to this Conclu&s;ion that he affixes his <HI>Q. E. D.</HI> And does <HI>this make nothing to our Cau&s;e?</HI> Pray wherein does the <HI>"unaccountable Folly"</HI> con&s;i&s;t of my alledging this Demon&s;tration? I am not willing to &s;ay, it was an unaccountable want of In|tegrity in him, to mi&s;repre&s;ent it as he does.&mdash; He &s;ays, We read nothing there of Epi&s;copacy's being a <HI>Fundamental</HI> of Religion: &mdash;But, If it was an In&s;ti|tution of the Apo&s;tles, as he has demon&s;trated it to be, I de&s;ire to know how much that falls &s;hort of ma|king it a Fundamental, &s;ince the Apo&s;tles were under the Direction of the Spirit of GOD in Planting and Settling the Churches &mdash; I own it is only an external of Religion, and &s;o were the two Sacraments, and I &s;hould be glad to be informed, &s;uppo&s;ing it proved to be an Apo&s;tolical In&s;titution, way it is not at lea&s;t as much a Fundamental in Chri&s;tianity, as <HI>Infant Bap|ti&s;m</HI> and the <HI>Fir&s;t-Day-Sabbath,</HI> which I conclude he holds to be Fundamentals, <HI>i. e. Nece&s;&s;ary;</HI> why then &s;hould he be &s;o much <HI>amazed</HI> as he pretends to be, that I e&s;teem Epi&s;copacy Fundamental. Sure I am, Go|vernment, and a proper Form of it, are things of Im|portance enough in them&s;elves to be made Funda|mentals, by being appointed by the Apo&s;tles; and I will be free to &s;ay, that if Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> and Mr. <HI>Chil|lingworth,</HI> and I may add, <HI>Potter, Slater, Sage, Brett, Bingham</HI>

and many others, (nay even <HI>Hoadly</HI> him&s;elf,) have not, by fair and ju&s;t Rea&s;oning, proved the <HI>Apo&s;tolical,</HI> and con&s;equently, <HI>Divine</HI> In&s;titution of Epi&s;copacy, &s;o that nothing but Sceptici&s;m, that will cavil at any thing, can pretend to di&s;pute it, I for my part &s;hall de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing any thing proved.</P>
<P>The chief u&s;e he makes of Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> again&s;t me is to di&s;prove what I plead for, re&s;pecting the u&s;e we make of the Fathers, in finding out the true Sen&s;e of the Scriptures in di&s;puted Ca&s;es.&mdash; Now as to this, I was &s;en&s;ible I had not &s;ufficiently ex|plained my &s;elf in my <HI>fir&s;t Letter,</HI> and therefore in my <HI>&s;econd Letter,</HI> I endeavoured to explain my &s;elf in &s;uch a manner as, I tho't, Ill-Will it &s;elf could not mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">repre&s;ent.&mdash; My Principle, as I then explain'd it, was to this Effect,&mdash; "That I take the H. Scrip|tures for the only Rule of my Faith and Practice, which is the great Fundamental Principle of the Church of <HI>England:</HI>&mdash; But ina&s;much as every Sect of Chri&s;tianity do al&s;o pretend to the Scriptures as their Rule; and there are &s;everal Texts, e&s;pecially re&s;pect|ing the External Polity of the Church, that are dif|ferently under&s;tood by different Sects: I judged the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t undoubted way to a&s;certain the mean|ing of tho&s;e Texts, after all the Light we could get from the Scriptures them&s;elves, was to appeal to the Facts and Practices that univer&s;ally obtained in the Church, immediately after Scripture-Times, and &s;o downwards thro' the fir&s;t and pure&s;t Ages, and to the Fathers who lived in tho&s;e Times, only as Witne&s;&s;es what tho&s;e Facts really were."&mdash; This Method I found our Di&s;&s;enting Brethren them&s;elves took, and that very ju&s;tly, to e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>Fir&s;t-Day Sabbath</HI> and <HI>Infant Bapti&s;m,</HI> which they e&s;teem as much Funda|mentals as we do <HI>Epi&s;copacy;</HI> and therefore they mu&s;t either allow our Method of Rea&s;oning to be good, or own that they are incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="003784_0085_10025B5C01E8CCD0">Now this &s;tating of the Ca&s;e Mr. <HI>Phileleuth.</HI> takes little, or no Notice of in his Reply, and leaves his Friend mi&s;erably helple&s;s where he mo&s;t needed his help; and one would think, by his Neglect of him in this Affair, that he was willing to Sacrifice In|fant-Bapti&s;m, and the Fir&s;t-Day Sabbath them&s;elves, &s;o that he might but de&s;troy Epi&s;copacy with them&mdash; All this he artfully conceals and keeps out of &s;ight, and in&s;tead of attending to it, as he ought to have done, in faithfulne&s;s to his Friend, and his own &s;ide; and notwith&s;tanding that I had abundantly cleared my &s;elf from &s;uch an Imputation: He would &s;till invidiou&s;ly have it believed, <HI>p.</HI> 72. That I joyn with the Papi&s;ts in &s;etting up Tradition as a Rule of my Faith, in Conjunction with the Scriptures, and makes a great &s;how with many large Quotations, not only from <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> but al&s;o from Bp. <HI>Jewel,</HI> Ep. <HI>Hall,</HI> A. Bp. <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> &amp;c. as tho' they condemned my way of Rea&s;oning; whereas, (however &s;ome few Pa&s;&s;ages may carry a different Sound with them, yet) in the whole, what they contend for is not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with it; &s;o far from this, that their Rea&s;oning again&s;t the Roman Catholics, is, in many In&s;tances upon the &s;ame foot with mine again&s;t the Presbyterians, who are both alike condemned by the Facts of the Pri|mitive Church. &mdash; But as to the Pa&s;&s;ages he quotes, let the impartial Inquirer examin them in the Au|thors them&s;elves, and compare them with what I plead, and he will readily &s;ee the Difference &mdash; They were pleading again&s;t the Corruptions and In|novations of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which were in|troduced &s;ome Hundreds of Years after the Apo&s;tles; whereas I was pleading for a Practice univer&s;ally ob|taining from their Days: &mdash; They were pleading again&s;t the Authority of Fathers that lived after the Introduction of tho&s;e Innovations, and of Writings of uncertain Authority; whereas I was pleading from the Authority of the Fathers who lived in the Apo&s;tolic
<PB N="85" REF="003784_0086_10025B5D87B192F0">
Age, and the two next Ages after them:&mdash; They were pleading again&s;t the Authority of the pretended oral or unwritten Traditions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> i. e. again&s;t Things which the <HI>Roman Catholics</HI> pre|tended, were, for &s;everal Ages, handed down from Age to Age, by Word of Mouth, for which they could produce no written Tradition at all; whereas I was pleading from the Authority of what was writ|ten and recorded by very many, and tho&s;e the mo&s;t faithful Witne&s;&s;es of Antiquity, of different Countrys, Nations and Languages, yet all con&s;piring in Atte&s;ta|tion to the &s;ame Facts: &mdash; The R. Catholics pre|tend to have Traditionary Interpretations of Scrip|ture &s;o handed down, to ju&s;tify what they hold, which I do with <HI>Chillingworth</HI> and <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> di&s;claim, and with them do appeal to open Univer&s;al Facts atte&s;ted to by the Fathers, as being what were obvious to every Man's Sen&s;es, nor do I argue from any Facts univer&s;ally obtaining in any one Age alone, which, I deny not but that they might be contrary to Facts as generally obtaining in another Age; but I argue from Facts that obtained in every Age, from the Beginning of Chri&s;tianity?&mdash; How di&s;ingenuou&s;ly then does this Gentleman deal, in pretending tho&s;e Authors were at all again&s;t me, and when he knows they were in the &s;ame Sentiment with me, on the Subject now under Debate?</P>
<P>My Adver&s;ary had written very contemptuou&s;ly of the Fathers, and their Authority and U&s;efulne&s;s: This I tho't it nece&s;&s;ary to animadvert upon, as tending to favour the Cau&s;e of Infidelity, by weaken|ing, if not de&s;troying the external Evidence of the Canon of the New-Te&s;tament, which can no otherwi&s;e be E&s;tabli&s;hed but by the Te&s;timony of the Fathers&punc; who are likewi&s;e Witne&s;&s;es to Epi&s;copacy.&mdash; And truly after all that this Gentleman has &s;aid, on this Head, I &s;hould be glad to be made &s;en&s;ible that the
<PB N="86" REF="003784_0087_10025B5F18EB8C10">
Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e.&mdash; Does it not weaken the com|mon Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity to weaken any one of the Evidences of it? Is not the Te&s;timony of the earlie&s;t Chri&s;tian Writers to the Apo&s;tolical authority of the &s;everal Books of the New Te&s;tament a mighty Evi|dence of their being Genuine? And are they not the &s;ame Men who are Witne&s;&s;es to their Apo&s;tolic Ori|ginal, and their being univer&s;ally received as &s;uch, that are al&s;o Witne&s;&s;es to the Apo&s;tolic Original of Epi&s;copacy, and its univer&s;al Reception? Does not therefore the weakening their Credibility with re|&s;pect to the one, weaken it al&s;o with regard to the other? If the Scriptures were tran&s;lated into divers Languages, and di&s;per&s;ed throughout all Countrys, did not Epi&s;copacy go every where with them? If the Scriptures were handed down from Age to Age, was not Epi&s;copacy handed down with them? Nay were they not Bi&s;hops that handed them down, and &s;pread them abroad &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Communication of their own Order? They received the Holy Books at fir&s;t from the Apo&s;tles, with their Orders, and conveyed them to others &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, with the &s;ame Orders. &mdash; And whatever this Gen|tleman or others may pretend again&s;t a Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops, can He or They find one Age or Nation of Chri&s;tendom, without Bi&s;hops, till of late, or wherein a Succe&s;&s;ive Ordination or Con&s;ecration by Impo&s;i|tion of Hands was not practi&s;ed and held nece&s;&s;ary for conveying that Character? If there have been &s;ome Irregularities in the Manner, mu&s;t they de&s;troy the E&s;&s;ence of the Thing? And if in any particular Church the Succe&s;&s;ion may have failed, did it there|fore, or could it, fail in the whole? If GOD's Pro|vidence was engaged for the Pre&s;ervation of the Scriptures, was it not al&s;o engaged to pre&s;erve a true Succe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who were to convey them down, and to explain and enforce them, and to <HI>be always with them to the End of the World?</HI></P>

<P>Put to go on,</P>
<P>This Gentleman, <HI>p.</HI> 91. &s;ugge&s;ts as tho' I in&s;inu|ated that the Divinity of Chri&s;t was doubtful, be|cau&s;e I mentioned it with Epi&s;copacy, as an In&s;tance wherein the Matters of Fact atte&s;ted by the Fathers, are highly u&s;eful to &s;atisfy us, that we take up a right Notion of the Scripture-Sen&s;e. Now, why &s;hould this be invidiou&s;ly repre&s;ented, as tho' I doubted whether the Divinity of Chri&s;t was plainly taught in Scripture? He knows I was not &s;peaking of either the one or the other, as being doubtful to me, but as being di&s;puted, &amp; con&s;equently doubted by others: He is not ignorant that there are tho&s;e that not|with&s;tanding the Plainne&s;s of Scripture, pretend to doubt, whether the Con&s;ub&s;tantiality of the Son with the Father be a Scripture-Doctrine? And to &s;atisfy them in this matter, I &s;ay it is highly u&s;eful to appeal to the Te&s;timony of the Fathers, whether that was con&s;tantly taught from the Beginning as a Scripture-Doctrine or not? The &s;ame I &s;ay with re&s;pect to Epi&s;copacy, It appears to me not doubtful but &s;uffi|ciently plain from Scripture, to be an Apo&s;tolical In&s;titution; but &s;ince there are tho&s;e that doubt and di&s;pute it, I plead, that the con&s;equent Facts ought, in all rea&s;on, to &s;atisfy, any one that it was &s;o.</P>
<P>But he &s;ays, &s;uppo&s;ing the Fact or Epi&s;copacy ever &s;o well atte&s;ted, <Q>He that argues from <HI>Fact</HI> to <HI>Right</HI> is a meer Sophi&s;ter.</Q> <HI>p.</HI> 80.&mdash; I allow this in all other Facts but &s;uch as are done under the Infalli|ble Conduct of the unerring Spirit of GOD; but in this Ca&s;e we may be undoubtedly argue from <HI>Fact</HI> to <HI>Right:</HI> The Apo&s;tles did, in <HI>Fact,</HI> wherever they pro|pagated Chri&s;tianity, in&s;titute Epi&s;copacy; we there|fore ju&s;tly conclude, that Form of Government, and that only, to be <HI>Right,</HI> and that it is our bounden Duty to &s;ubmit to it, and that it ought to be con|tinued in all Churches to the End of the World.&mdash;
<PB N="90" REF="003784_0091_10025B69A0D6AD60">
Is this Sophi&s;try? No &s;ure, There can be no Dan|ger of erring in arguing thus: The only Que&s;tion then is, whether the Apo&s;tles did in Fact in&s;titute Epi&s;copacy? We think it plain from Scripture, that they did, in the Per&s;ons of <HI>Timothy, Titus,</HI> and the <HI>Angels</HI> of the &s;even Churches; and we are well a&s;&s;ured that we are not mi&s;taken, &s;ince we find it &s;o clearly atte&s;ted by the Fathers, <HI>Clemens, Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian</HI> and <HI>Cyprian,</HI> which I quoted, be&s;ides many others, within the three fir&s;t Centuries &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, that I might have mentioned, and which have often over and over been alledged, that the Apo&s;tles did every where in&s;titute Epi&s;copacy, in our Sen&s;e of it. Nay Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> (whom he &s;o ba&s;ely mi&s;|repre&s;ents, and &s;o emptily Triumphs in,) &s;ays, in the Margin of his Demon&s;tration, that <Q>Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> has fully demon&s;trated it, in his <HI>Di&s;&s;ertations again&s;t Blondel,</HI> (which, &s;ays he, never were an&s;wered, and never will) by the Te&s;timonies of tho&s;e, who wrote in the very next Ages after the Apo&s;tles</Q>. not to mention <HI>Molineus</HI>'s, <HI>Beza</HI>'s, <HI>Chamier</HI>'s and <HI>Vedelius</HI>'s Conce&s;&s;ions, on which he builds his Demon&s;tration. &mdash; But of the Facts them&s;elves, I &s;hall &s;ay more af|terwards.</P>
<P>His grand Objection again&s;t my way of arguing is taken from the <HI>Chilia&s;t</HI> Notion of <HI>Chri&s;t's per&s;onal Reign on Earth,</HI> and the <HI>Communicating of Infants:</HI>&mdash; The&s;e, he pleads were univer&s;al <HI>Facts</HI> of the primitive Church, and we may as well, argue the <HI>Right</HI> of them, as of Epi&s;copacy, from the &s;ame Rea&s;on.&mdash; To all which, I an&s;wer&mdash; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Suppo&s;ing the Ca&s;e to be as he repre&s;ents it, his Friend <HI>Elutherius</HI> was im|pertinent in appealing with &s;o much A&s;&s;urance to the univer&s;al Fact of <HI>Infant-Bapti&s;m</HI> in tho&s;e Days in Proof of it's Divine In&s;titution. And you mu&s;t never here|after pretend to argue from the Fathers, but be confined to Scripture alone in proving, that and the <HI>Fir&s;t-Day-Sabbath,</HI>

in both which Ca&s;es, your Adver&s;aries will perhaps be even with you, at lea&s;t, if Antiquity be not taken into the Account &mdash; But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> The In&s;tances of the <HI>Chilia&s;t</HI> Opinion and <HI>Communicating of Infants,</HI> are not in any mea&s;ure upon a par with <HI>E|pi&s;copacy:</HI> For, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to the <HI>Communicating of Infants,</HI> I cannot find that there is any one Father within the the 3 fir&s;t Centuries that ever pretended they had that Practice from the Apo&s;tles: Nay, I am per&s;uaded it cannot be made appear to be Univer&s;al Matter of Fact within the 2 fir&s;t Centuries. &mdash; There are indeed two Pa&s;&s;ages, one in <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> the pretended <HI>Areopagite,</HI> and another in the <HI>Clementine Con&s;titutions,</HI> which are both Writings of very dubious Authority, that &s;eem to allude to &s;uch a Cu&s;tom's obtaining in their Time, and there is a Pa&s;&s;age or two in St <HI>Cyprian</HI> that &s;eem to imply as much: I &s;ay the&s;e three In&s;tan|ces, and two of them of very doubtful Authority, are all that I can find concerning this Cu&s;tom within the 3 fir&s;t Centuries; and will this Gentleman pretend <HI>Communicating Infants</HI> is proved to be equally early, and univer&s;al Matter of Fact with Epi&s;copacy, and equally derived from the Apo&s;tles? What partiality is here? I deny not that it was practi&s;ed in <HI>Africa</HI> in St. <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Time, and &s;o was <HI>Rebapti&s;ing Heretics,</HI> which la&s;t mentioned Practice, tho' it obtained there, was contrary to the general Practice of the Church; &amp; &s;o might the former for ought that appears to the contrary. It is confe&s;&s;ed, that this Practice did at length, by degrees univer&s;ally obtain in the Church, and in St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>'s Time, in the beginning of the 5th Century, it was (as &s;everal other irregularities were, that had crept into the Church by that Time,) pretended to have been derived down by Tradition from the Apo&s;tles, but there does not appear to have been any manner of Foundation for &s;uch a preten&s;e. &mdash; What then is this to the Ca&s;e of Epi&s;copacy, which had been con|&s;tantly mentioned in every Age from the very be|ginning
<PB N="92" REF="003784_0093_10025B6F67A6F488">
as derived from the Apo&s;tles? And I am free to own that if this Practice could be made appear as evidently to have been derived from the Apo&s;tles, as Epi&s;copacy, I &s;hould have the like Veneration for it as I have for that, e&s;pecially, provided al&s;o there were as good Grounds for it in the Scriptures as there are for that: Whereas there does not appear to be any Grounds at all.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Secondly,</HI> as to the <HI>Chilia&s;t Opinion,</HI> it con&s;i&s;ted only in adhering too &s;trictly to the Letter of that Pa&s;&s;age in the 20th of <HI>Revelations,</HI> concerning the Saints <HI>Reigning with Chri&s;t a</HI> 1000 <HI>Years.</HI> &mdash; This No|tion, I own, did get con&s;iderable Footing in the Church in the &s;econd and third Centuries; but it took it's Ri&s;e from the &s;ingle Te&s;timony of <HI>Papias,</HI> an hone&s;t, but weak Man, who pretended he had it from St. <HI>John,</HI> as the true Sen&s;e of that Pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Reve|lations,</HI> in which it is ea&s;y to imagin he might be mi&s;taken: But it does not appear to have been ever the <HI>univer&s;al</HI> Belief of the Church. &mdash; It is true, Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> and Archbp. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> do make u&s;e of it again&s;t the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and &s;peak of it as being gene|rally received: But Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> &s;ince, in his Treati&s;e of the <HI>Millennium,</HI> has, I think effectually confuted the Arguments they u&s;e, and made it &s;ufficiently ap|pear, from even <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI> and <HI>Irenaeus</HI> them&s;elves, who were <HI>Chilia&s;ts,</HI> and from <HI>Origen,</HI> That it never was the univer&s;al Doctrine of the Church: For Brevity I omit his Arguments, and beg the Reader to con|&s;ult Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> in that Treati&s;e, where I think he cannot fail of receiving Satisfaction in this Point. &mdash; Upon the whole, I cannot &s;ee, that either our Cau&s;e, or my way of Rea&s;oning in Defence of it, are at all endangered by what this Gentleman argues from that Practice of Communicating Infants, or this Opinion of the <HI>Chilia&s;ts:</HI> They do by no means appear to be parallel In&s;tances with Epi&s;copacy: All his boa&s;ting therefore on this Head is utterly empty and vain.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="003784_0094_10025B70EBCDCE60">And now we are come to the Stating of the Que&s;|tion; in order to which I had made this Ob&s;ervation, as being what I judged ju&s;t in it &s;elf, as well as a nece&s;&s;ary Means in order to prevent contending about Words, <HI>viz.</HI> That there is no more arguing from the promi&s;cuous U&s;e of the Words <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter,</HI> to prove them the &s;ame Order, than from the promi&s;cuous U&s;e of the Words <HI>Apo&s;tle, Presbyter,</HI> and <HI>Deacon</HI> to prove them to be the &s;ame Order: Now I can &s;ee little el&s;e but meer Cavilling in all that is &s;aid on this head: I readily allow the Word <HI>Deacon,</HI> when applied to the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.5. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is not u&s;ed in a re&s;trained Sen&s;e to &s;ignifie the Office &s;o called, but it is evidently &s;o far re&s;trained as to &s;ignifie the mi|ni&s;terial Office in general; for he is there &s;peaking of the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel, <HI>whereof,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I am made a Mini&s;ter;</HI> and therefore what I contend for is, that as the Word <HI>Deacon</HI> or Mini&s;ter does not always &s;ignifie a particular Office in the Mini&s;try, &s;o neither can the Word <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> be nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ignifie a particular Office: And that therefore a <HI>Presbyter</HI> is an <HI>Over&s;eer</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> only in the &s;ame Sen&s;e as an <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> is a Mini&s;ter or <HI>Deacon;</HI> tho&s;e Terms being always re&s;trained to the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> in ge|neral, tho' not always to any particular Office of it: And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> calls him&s;elf a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.1. as what was implyed in his Apo&s;tle-&s;hip, tho' not therefore implying all that his Apo&s;tle-&s;hip did imply. So that what I plead is, that it is plain, and nothing can be plainer, than that the&s;e Words being all frequently u&s;ed in a general Sen&s;e in the New-Te&s;tament, there is no certain arguing from them to the more re&s;trained Sen&s;e in which they were u&s;ed afterwards; and that therefore we ought to leave off arguing from the promi&s;cuous U&s;e of Words, and to be determined wholly by Facts. Accordingly I &s;tated the Que&s;tion between us to be this, &mdash; <HI>Whether the Apo&s;tles did not appoint in each Church, a Pre&s;ident or Go|vernor Superior to, and with Juri&s;diction over the Presbyters
<PB N="94" REF="003784_0095_10025B762D7ECA20">
and Deacons, who were Officers of that Church, as well as the People under them?</HI> And here I mu&s;t own, It was a vain attempt for me to endeavour by Words to <HI>fix</HI> any one of this Gentleman's &s;ceptical Humour: One might as well undertake to fix <HI>Proteus</HI> him&s;elf to one particular Shape: For tho' I believe there is nobody that had a Mind to under&s;tand another, and that was not re&s;olved to indulge a meer Strife about Words, but would readily enough comprehend my meaning; yet Mr. <HI>Phileleuth.</HI> notwith&s;tanding he him|&s;elf owns with me that we &s;hould <HI>wholly leave con|tending about Terms, p.</HI> 101 <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and profe&s;&s;es he <HI>de&s;ires to under&s;tand, and hates and &s;corns a meer &s;trife of Words, is</HI> &s;adly puzzled to under&s;tand me, and &s;pends no le&s;s than 5 Pages, here, be&s;ides many more el&s;e where in carping and quibbling upon the Words of the Que&s;|tion as I have &s;tated it: And I mu&s;t again explain what I mean by a Church? And what I mean by a Governor or Pre&s;ident of it, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> Tho I had &s;uffi|ciently explained my &s;elf on all the&s;e Points before.</P>
<P>Now as to the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> it is plain to me from Scripture and Antiquity, that by a <HI>particular Church</HI> was ordi|narily meant all the Chri&s;tians of a City, with the adjacent Country depending on it, even tho' they con&s;i&s;ted of many Congregations; as I proved they generally did, even in the mo&s;t Primitive Times: I have owned that it was many Years before any Parochial Bounds were fixed to the &s;everal Congre|gations, this being meerly a circum&s;tantial Thing. In this &s;en&s;e I &s;hewed, we mu&s;t unavoidably under|&s;tand the Churches of <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Ephe&s;us, Corinth, Rome, Smyrna,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Scripture-Churches. I deny not but the Word <HI>Church</HI> may &s;ometimes in Scripture mean a particular Congregation, as when we read <HI>of a Church in a Hou&s;e, Rom.</HI> 16.5. and &s;o it might po&s;&s;ibly mean in the Text he mentions, 1 Cor. 14.34. <HI>of Women &s;peaking in the Churches;</HI> tho' it &s;eems
<PB N="95" REF="003784_0096_10025B7391BD7930">
to me more probable this ought to be under&s;tood of the <HI>Places</HI> of Wor&s;hip, like that, <HI>Chap.</HI> 11.22. <HI>Have ye not Hou&s;es to Eat and Drink in, or de&s;pi&s;e ye the Church of GOD? i. e.</HI> the Place dedicated to his Wor&s;hip.

<P>I &s;ay <HI>ordinarily</HI> all the Chri&s;tians of one City and Country adjacent, were a particular Church, and but one Bi&s;hop pre&s;ided over each of them: Not that this was ever reckoned a nece&s;&s;ary Rule, but what was judged mo&s;t for the public Advantage always governed: Hence when two Cities were very near each other, they were united together under one Bi&s;hop; and on the other Hand, when there was a large Country without any City in it, it was divi|ded into &s;everal Di&s;tricts, like Counties, the chief

<P>And as to the Government of each particular Church, tho' he pretends to be &s;o much at a lo&s;s for my meaning, he knows well enough, that what we con|tend for, is, that this is, and was always deemed to be e&s;&s;ential to Epi&s;copacy, that in each Di&s;trict, be it a City, with it's adjacent Country, or a Chief Town with it's County, there be one chief Head or Gover|nour, ordain'd to that Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, who has &s;uch a Pre&s;i|dency ever the re&s;t of the Clergy, and the People under <HI>them,</HI> as well as him, and in &s;ubordination to him, as may be properly called, a <HI>Jurisdiction,</HI> not Legi&s;lative but Executive, not De&s;potic and Abitrary, but l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mited by Laws which he may not di&s;pen&s;e with, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may he any more tran&s;gre&s;s them than the meane&s;t Presbyter.&mdash;And this was always the &s;ame in the Church, whatever Irregularities and Exorbi|tances there may have been in &s;ome Places &amp; Times, and whatever accidental Alterations there have been, are, and lawfully may be on Account of which it is

a mean Artifice of our Adver&s;aries, when we prove that &s;uch a Per&s;on was always from the Beginning at the Head of the Clergy in each Church, to cry out. O, But tho&s;e <HI>ancient</HI> Bi&s;hops were not of the &s;ame kind with our <HI>modern</HI> Bi&s;hops: Why truly, we don't pretend that they were <HI>Lords,</HI> or had many other Temporal Privileges which Chri&s;tian Kings and Princes have &s;ince granted to Bi&s;hops, or that there was always one preci&s;e Method in their pub|lick Admini&s;trations; notwith&s;tanding the&s;e, and the like purely Circum&s;tantial Differences, we in&s;i&s;t upon it that our Bi&s;hops are now of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e <HI>ancient</HI> Bi&s;hops, as to what was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ways e&s;&s;ential to their Office and Character, be they called <HI>Prelates, Pre&s;idents, Governours, Moderators,</HI> or what they will.</P>
<P>Another Quibble that runs thro' this Gentleman's Performance, is, That tho&s;e primitive <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> were not of a <HI>different Order</HI> from the <HI>Presbyters.</HI>&mdash; To this I an&s;wer, That to me it &s;eems a meer Strife a|bout Words to object again&s;t calling them di&s;tinct Orders: However, If that would plea&s;e him, I &s;hould find no fault with Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI>'s Account of the dif|ferent Orders, which he him&s;elf quotes, <HI>p.</HI> 47. <Q>That the Clergy be divided into two Orders, Presbyters and Deacons, and that of Presbyters, &s;ome be greater, &s;ome le&s;s in Power, and that by our Saviour's own Appointment.</Q> Thus the whole Clergy of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church were <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Levites,</HI> but the High Prie&s;t was never the le&s;s, by Divine Appoint|ment, &s;uperior to the other Prie&s;ts.

So incon&s;i&s;tent are fal&s;e Schemes one with another, as well as with Truth! &mdash; That <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s Bi&s;hops had the &s;ole Power of Ordination is manife&s;t, not only from the Canon abovementioned, but al&s;o from hence, that there is not one In&s;tance to be given, in all Antiquity, of any other approved Ordinations, but what were performed by Bi&s;hops, as Mr. <HI>Bingham</HI> a|bundantly proves,<HI>l.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 3. &sect;. 6. and I challenge one In&s;tance to be produced. &mdash; And la&s;tly, That <HI>Ignatius</HI> held Epi&s;copacy to be Fundamental, is clear from many Pa&s;&s;ages, particularly <HI>Ep. ad Eph.</HI> &sect;. 3. where he &s;ays, that <Q>the Bi&s;hops appointed unto the utmo&s;t Bounds of the Earth are by the Will of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI></Q>. And &sect;. 5. <Q>Let us take heed that we do not &s;et our+&s;elves again&s;t the Bi&s;hop that we may be &s;ubject to GOD</Q>.

<P>And now as to St. <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Te&s;timonies, who lived within 150 Years of the Apo&s;tles: I mu&s;t have the Charity to believe, that this Gentleman never

well as many other Places. In the 35th <HI>Ep</HI> he gives his Clergy an Account of his having ordained <HI>Nu|midicus</HI> Presbyter, and calls them, <HI>"his Clergy":</HI> and in that, and <HI>Ep.</HI> 38. he &s;peaks of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Pro|motions as depending on the Bi&s;hop; can the&s;e and the like Expre&s;&s;ions be reconciled with the Character of a modern Moderator of a Presbytery?&mdash; In <HI>Ep.</HI> 39. he tells them "he had &s;u&s;pended or cen&s;ured &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons".&mdash; In <HI>Ep.</HI> 69. he &s;ays, <Q>The Bi&s;hops &s;ucceed the Apo&s;tles by vicarious Ordina|tion,</Q> and calls them "<HI>Governours</HI> of the Church", as he al&s;o does in the Council of <HI>Carthage;</HI> and in <HI>Ep.</HI> 76. he makes a Regular <Q>Succe&s;&s;ion from the Apo|&s;tles nece&s;&s;ary to a lawful Ordination</Q>, and the &s;ame does <HI>Firmilian,</HI> Ep. 75. &mdash; But it would be endle&s;s to mention all the Pa&s;&s;ages in St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> that explain the Nature of the Epi&s;copacy of tho&s;e Times, as being manife&s;tly of the kind we plead for. I wi&s;h the Reader could at lea&s;t con&s;ult the&s;e, and that he would readily &s;ee how far this Gentleman is from giving a fair and ju&s;t Repre&s;entation of St. <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Sen&s;e.&mdash; Nothing can be more evident from the whole of his Conduct with re&s;pect to his Presbyters, than that he had, and exerci&s;ed a proper, tho' limited Jurisdiction or Government over them; and yet this unaccountable Gentleman would face down the good old Father and the whole Primitive Chri&s;tian World, That his, and all the ancient Epi&s;copacy was only a meer Primacy.</P>
<P>Well, But he undertakes to prove this from St. <HI>Cy|prian</HI> him&s;elf; who, in his Tract <HI>De unitate Eccle&s;iae,</HI> makes the Primacy of <HI>Peter</HI> with re&s;pect to the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles who were of the &s;ame Order with him|&s;elf, a Pattern for all &s;ucceeding Bi&s;hops. Now as to this, I think it will be plain to whoever will con&s;ult that Pa&s;&s;age, compared with the De&s;ign of the Di&s;|cour&s;e, and the other Pa&s;&s;ages of his Works which I have referred to, that among other Arguments for
<PB N="110" REF="003784_0111_10025B97C39B0CC8">
Unity, he u&s;es this, That as the Apo&s;tolate was one, each Apo&s;tle having the whole Authority of the en|tire Apo&s;tolate; &s;o the Epi&s;copate which &s;uccceds it, is but One each Bi&s;hop having the whole Authority of the Epi&s;copate: But as the Unity of the Apo&s;tolate centered in the Primacy of <HI>Peter,</HI> &s;o he would have the Unity of the Epi&s;copate center in the Primacy of One in each Province, which Primacy is menti|oned in the 6th Canon of the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> as an <HI>ancient Cu&s;tom,</HI> and as having univer&s;ally obtained in the Church: See Bp. <HI>Fell</HI>'s Notes <HI>in loc.</HI> &mdash; And agreeably to this Sen&s;e of St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> St. <HI>Jerom</HI> pleads, <Q>That all Bi&s;hops have the &s;ame Power, whether the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> or of <HI>Eugubium,</HI> whether they be great or &s;mall, rich or poor? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They are all alike Succe&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles</Q>: And yet he would have a Primacy among them, as appears from the Pa&s;&s;age this Gentleman refers to. &mdash; All that can be gathered from the Pa&s;&s;ages, therefore, is, that all Bi&s;hops are equal, as all the Apo&s;tles were to whom they &s;ucceed; but does it therefore follow, that, ac|cording to them, Bi&s;hops and Presbyters are equal? By no means, for they are not &s;peaking a word in tho&s;e Places of Presbyters: &mdash; They would have a Primacy in each Province among the Bi&s;hops, as <HI>Peter</HI> was Primate among the Apo&s;tles: but does it therefore follow that the Bi&s;hop has only a Primacy among the Presbyters? No &s;uch thing, for neither of them ever &s;peak of Presbyters as being the proper Suc|ce&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles. &mdash; This Gentleman there|fore does manife&s;tly pervert the true Sen&s;e of St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> and St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> in under&s;tanding them to mean that the ancient Bi&s;hops had only a Primacy with re&s;pect to the Presbyters, ju&s;t as St. <HI>Peter</HI> had with regard to the other Apo&s;tles: for they are not &s;peaking a Syl|lable in tho&s;e Places of the Bi&s;hop with re&s;pect to his Presbytery, but of the Bi&s;hops among them&s;elves; neither is St <HI>Cyprian</HI> there &s;peaking of the Unity of

a particular Church, but of the Catholick Church; and maintains, as I have &s;aid, that as there is one Apo&s;tolate, of which each Apo&s;tle had the whole Power, &s;o there is one Epi&s;copate, of which each Bi&s;hop has the whole Power! Never does he once &s;peak thus of Presbyters, tho' he very often mentions them, but ever &s;peaks of them as being di&s;tinct from Bi&s;hops, and inferior and &s;ubject to them: But as there was a Primacy in the Apo&s;tolate; &s;o he fre|quently &s;peaks of a Primacy in the Epi&s;copate in each Province, but never does he &s;peek of this in regard to the Presbytery.&mdash;He him&s;elf was Primate or Arch-Bi&s;hop of the Province of <HI>Africa,</HI> and pre&s;ided in the Council of <HI>Carthage,</HI> in which, be&s;ide many Presbyters and Deacons, there were 87 Bi&s;hops of that Country: on which Occa&s;ion, he &s;ays, <Q>None of us takes upon him to be a <HI>Bi&s;hop of Bi&s;hops.</HI></Q> i. e. To exerci&s;e a proper Jurisdiction over other Bi&s;hops: In this con&s;i&s;ted the Papal U&s;urpation afterwards, turning the <HI>Primacy</HI> into a Supremacy, and the Spiritual into a Worldly Dominion: This St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> di&s;clames, (as did even <HI>Gregory</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> a Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> above 300 Years after this:) But it is evident from his E|pi&s;tles, that he was at the &s;ame time a <HI>Bi&s;hop of Presbyters,</HI> and did exerci&s;e a proper, tho' limited Jurisdiction or Government over the Presbyters, Deacons and People of his own particular Church of <HI>Carthage.</HI>&mdash; And now I appeal to every unprejudiced Reader, whether I have not truly and ju&s;tly repre&s;ented his Sen&s;e, and the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Primitive Times, and con&s;equently whether this Gentleman hath not gro&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented it.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> is formed exactly according to St. <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Model as to all the particulars I have been mentioning: Does he make all the Apo&s;tles e|qual in Power with St. <HI>Peter?</HI> So are all our Bi&s;hops equal in Power with the Archbi&s;hops, except what a meer Primacy for Order nece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly implys: &mdash; Had

<HI>Peter</HI> a Primacy with re&s;pect to the other Apo&s;tles? So have our Archbi&s;hops with re&s;pect to the other Bi&s;hops, and as St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> likewi&s;e had with re&s;pect to the other Bi&s;hops of <HI>Affrica.</HI> &mdash; Did the Unity of the Primitive Church, as to its common Polity, center in this Primacy? So does the Unity of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> &mdash; Had St. <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s &amp; <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s Bi&s;hops each of them Presbyters under them, and a limited Juri&s;diction over the Clergy, as well as Peo|ple, each one in his own Church? So have the Bi|&s;hops of <HI>England</HI> each in his, and only a limited Ju|ri&s;diction: &mdash;The Bi&s;hops of tho&s;e Times alone ordained, and &s;o do ours, excepting that the Presby|ters with us a&s;&s;i&s;t in ordaining Presbyters, and &s;o they probably did then. Some circum&s;tantial Difference there may be, but the Sub&s;tance, or mo&s;t material Points of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government, are the &s;ame.&mdash; Upon the whole, I can truly &s;ay, I de&s;ire no other kind of Bi&s;hops than &s;uch as were in St. <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s time; and if I did not &s;incerely think that tho&s;e of our Church were manife&s;tly of the &s;ame kind with them, I would immediately drop my Pen, and never under|take to plead her Cau&s;e any more.</P>
<P>But before I fini&s;h, I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, That this Gentleman &s;eems, after all, not unwilling to own that the <HI>Cyprianic,</HI> and even the <HI>Ignatian</HI> Bi&s;hops, (nay, and even <HI>Timothy, Titus</HI> and the 7 Angels them&s;elves, were at lea&s;t <HI>fixed Moderators, p.</HI> 127, 128, 152, And for ought I can &s;ee, his Argument from St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Pri|macy mu&s;t make them fixed by <HI>Divine Appointment:</HI> By which I think he mu&s;t be allowed to grant that the way of the&s;e <HI>New-England</HI> Churches, and the <HI>Scotch</HI> Presbyterians, are not conformed to the Primitive Model, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles; for it is well known that theirs are only vague Modera|tors, and cho&s;en <HI>pro re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ata.</HI> &mdash; Now &s;eeing he is come &s;o near to us, as not only to allow that tho&s;e whom we call Primitive Bi&s;hops might be fixed Mo|derators
<PB N="113" REF="003784_0114_10025B9DA494F998">
or fixed Pre&s;idents, as in fact they were, and &s;eems not to di&s;like this Con&s;titution; methinks it is pity we &s;hould differ any longer. Let him only grant two Things more, which the Primitive Model certainly al&s;o requires, <HI>viz.</HI> That the&s;e fixed Pre&s;i|dents be ordained to their Office with Impo&s;ition of Hands, by tho&s;e of their own Order, and That no Act of Ordination and Government be allowed but under their Pre&s;idency: Nay, rather than fail, let it be &s;o limited, if he plea&s;es, as that the Pre&s;ident &s;hall no more be allowed to do any thing of Moment with|out his <HI>Presbytery,</HI> than They without him; I &s;ay let the&s;e things be granted, and we will be at once uni|ted with him, and all be one Communion again.</P>
<P>And now to conclude: As to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Charity,</HI> I mu&s;t think my Brother <HI>Phil.</HI> hath not con&s;idered the Expre&s;&s;ions I u&s;ed, (which he will needs have to be incon&s;i&s;tent with both It and Them&s;elves) with that Candor and Charity he might and ought to have done. &mdash; For GOD's &s;ake, my Brethren, Let us not, for the Future, &s;tudy to put the wor&s;t Con&s;tructions we can on one anothers Words or Actions; but let us rather endeavour to make the be&s;t we can of them: Let us not try to magnifie and aggravate the Diffe|rences between us, but rather to make as little of them, and to con&s;ider them with as much Tenderne&s;s, as po&s;&s;ible: Let us not di&s;pute which has already mo&s;t or lea&s;t Charity, but let us &s;trive to &s;ee who &s;hall hereafter, really and in fact, mo&s;t abound in the Practice of that Heavenly Vertue, both towards each other, and towards all Men: This is the be&s;t Cour&s;e we can take, as far as po&s;&s;ible in this imperfect State, to reconcile our &s;elves to one another, both in Judg|ment and Practice; to meet together in Truth, and live in Peace here, or however to meet at la&s;t in that perfect State of Truth, and Peace, and Holine&s;s hereafter, where GOD and Charity alone &s;hall forever Reign!</P>
