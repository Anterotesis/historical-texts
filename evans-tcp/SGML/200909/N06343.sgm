<P>THIS chapter contains an ac|count of the Preaching of &s;aint John the Bapti&s;t; who, being called of God in the wilderne&s;s, and duly commi&s;&s;ioned for his high office, <HI>came into all the country about Jordan,

preaching to the people the</HI> BAPTISM <HI>of</HI> RE|PENTANCE <HI>for the</HI> REMISSION <HI>of</HI> SINS.</P>
<P>THE more thoroughly to awake their at|tention and evince the nece&s;&s;ity of his doc|trine, he appears in the mo&s;t &s;triking cha|racter; being, as was prophe&s;ied concern|ing him, <HI>the voice of one crying in the wil|derne&s;s; prepare ye the way of the Lord; make his paths &s;traight!

<P>THESE words allude to a known cu&s;tom of great Kings, who, when they undertook any long journey, were wont to &s;end forth their me&s;&s;engers before them; proclaiming it among the people to make their way plain. Now as the Jews, at this time, daily looked for the Coming of their KING or PROMISED MESSIAH, &s;uch a proclama|tion, from to extraordinary a per&s;on,
<PB N="3" REF="008042_0005_102E1C5C41053330">
crying out to clear the way, <HI>for that the Salvation of God was at hand,</HI> could not fail to excite their curio&s;ity, and intere&s;t their affections!</P>
<P>EVERY heart was accordingly &s;eiz'd with an in&s;tant hope of beholding the DESIRE OF NATIONS; with whom they expected to &s;hare Crowns and Empire and Temporal Glory. Nay, they began <HI>to mu&s;e in their hearts whether John</HI> him&s;elf <HI>were the Chri&s;t</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They were, no doubt, &s;ometime in this &s;u&s;pen&s;e, be|fore John re&s;olves them, by telling them that he was not the Chri&s;t, nor even worthy to unloo&s;e the latchet of his &s;hoes; but that the Chri&s;t was quickly to follow after him.</NOTE>, or only his fore-runner. In either ca&s;e, they were eager to embrace the Bapti&s;m which he preached; as artful Courtiers will &s;trive to recommend them&s;elves to the Graces of an expected Ma&s;ter. Hence, <HI>a Multitude of them came forth, to be baptiz'd of him.</HI></P>
<P>JOHN, who &s;aw their carnal views, is not too forward in conferring his Bapti&s;m upon them, without duly in&s;tructing them

They are not of a Carnal but a Spiritual nature. Nor will it avail you any thing to &s;ay, <HI>we have Abraham to our father;</HI> and are thereby the children of Promi&s;e.

<P>AMONG others who pre&s;&s;ed forward, on this occa&s;ion, came the <HI>Publicans,</HI> a &s;et of men infamous for their illegal Exactions upon the people, crying&mdash;<HI>Ma&s;ter, what &s;hall we do?</HI> John, who knew their character, &s;trikes boldly at their capital vice; charging by their hope of Salvation and their dread of Ruin,&mdash;<HI>exact no more than what is ap|pointed you</HI> by law; for how &s;hall you

<P>LAST of all came the SOLDIERS <HI>demand|ing of him likewi&s;e, &s;aying&mdash;and what &s;hall we do? he &s;aid unto them do violence to no man, neither accu&s;e any fal&s;ely, and be content with your wages.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH are the words which were recom|mended to me as the &s;ubject of this di&s;cour&s;e. And had I been left to my own choice, I could not have &s;elected any more &s;uitable, nor more becoming a Go&s;pel-mini&s;ter to explain, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. For being delivered by divine In&s;piration, at a mo&s;t important period; namely, when the Soldiers them|&s;elves earne&s;tly reque&s;ted to know, by what means they might e&s;cape the threatned Fire of God's wrath, and obtain <HI>&s;alvation</HI> thro' the Me&s;&s;iah, we may be &s;ure they imply in them the fundamental parts of the CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS DUTY; &s;o far at lea&s;t as relates to that particular character.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008042_0009_102E1C64F1E37430">I &s;hall therefore proceed upon them, in their natural order. With diffidence, how|ever, I enter upon my &s;ubject. I know many of you to be men of di&s;tingui&s;hed un|der&s;tanding; con&s;cious of the dignity of your own character, and of the glorious cau&s;e wherein you are engaged. And nothing but your own expre&s;s de&s;ire, could give me courage to offer my thoughts concern|ing any part of your duty. But, being invited thereto, I &s;hall proceed to the utmo&s;t of my abilities, as far as the time will permit. And, whatever may be the execu|tion, I can &s;afely &s;ay that I bring with me a heart panting for the Public&mdash;and for you!</P>
<P>FIRST, then, the Chri&s;tian-&s;oldier is to <HI>do</HI> VIOLENCE <HI>to no man.</HI> There are two &s;orts of violence which a Soldier may be guilty of. One is again&s;t tho&s;e who are lawfully ve&s;ted with Command over him. This is commonly &s;tiled Mutiny, and is a crime of the mo&s;t atrocious nature; &s;eldom to be expiated but by the DEATH of the offender. And as God is a God of Order, it mu&s;t be peculiarly odious to him.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="008042_0010_102E1C681ED38E48">ANOTHER &s;ort of Violence, which a Sol|dier may be guilty of, is again&s;t his Fellow-&s;ubjects. This is that Violence more im|mediately meant in the text; the original word there, &s;ignifying, the &s;haking or ter|rifying a man, &s;o as to force money from him, thro' fear. This we find expre&s;&s;ly forbid by the Spirit of Chri&s;tianity, under pain of forfeiting the Salvation of God. And we may glory to &s;ay that it is al&s;o forbid by the mild Spirit of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution!</P>
<P>OUR Soldiery are armed by the laws of their country, and &s;upported by the com|munity; not to command, but to &s;erve, it; not to oppre&s;s, but to protect, it. Should they, therefore, turn their &s;word again&s;t tho&s;e from whom they derive their authority, and thus <HI>violate</HI> the ju&s;t rights even but of one Freeman, who contributes to their &s;upport&mdash;what a complication of guilt would it imply? It would be Treachery! It would be Ingratitude! Nay it would be Parricide!</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="008042_0011_102E1C6A85150A68">AS for the Tyrants of mankind, let them (belying heaven and pretending an authority from God!) let them lead forth their armed Slaves to plunder, to hara&s;s and to de&s;troy tho&s;e, to whom they owe Protection! Let them fill tho&s;e lands with Violence and Blood, which they ought to fill with Ble&s;|&s;ing and Joy! verily I &s;ay unto you they &s;hall have their reward. For, tru&s;t me, &s;uch actions are odious to Heaven, repug|nant to the Go&s;pel; and God will certainly avenge his own cau&s;e!</P>
<P>HAPPY for us, we rejoice under milder influences! our gracious Sovereign, thro' a long and pro&s;perous reign, has never, in any in&s;tance, offered Violence to the rights of his &s;ubjects; nor permitted it in his &s;ervants. The amiable nobleman, placed over us in our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, has long been di&s;tingui&s;hed as a patron of Ju&s;tice, and a true friend of Briti&s;h Liberty. And, tho' appointed to the mo&s;t difficult Command, with a great army under him, among a people long accu&s;tom'd to a profound peace, jealous of their Liberties, and &s;ome of them
<PB N="10" REF="008042_0012_102E1C6C29D2CD68">
even unrea&s;onably prejudiced again&s;t all <HI>force</HI> and <HI>arms;</HI> yet &s;uch has been his conduct, that he has happily reconciled jarring intere&s;ts, and &s;upported the Military, without violating the Civil, power.</P>
<P>HENCE, general harmony has diffu&s;ed it&s;elf thro' all the parts of his exten&s;ive Command. As a &s;ignal in&s;tance of this, it will be but ju&s;tice to mention you, gentlemen, of this Battalion which I have now the honour to addre&s;s. You have been among us for &s;everal months. You were at fir&s;t but a raw unform'd corps; and from your manner of being quartered out in &s;mall parties among the inhabitants of this city, di&s;orders might have been expected. But quite the rever&s;e has happened. No deeds of Violence have been offered. No com|plainings have been heard in our &s;treets. Your conduct has done honour to your|&s;elves; done honour to your Officers in general, and to your worthy Commandant in particular; who&s;e name is thereby become dear to us. And our be&s;t wi&s;hes will attend
<PB N="11" REF="008042_0013_102E1C6E8E4CACD0">
him and them and you, whither&s;oever you are de&s;tined.</P>
<P>ALL I &s;hall add on this head is, to be&s;eech you, by your hopes of the Go&s;pel|promi&s;es, to per&s;evere in the &s;ame dutiful inoffen&s;ive behaviour towards your fellow-citizens, in all parts of your future conduct. And, as you can never be led to deeds of Violence by any authority appointed over you, let it never be &s;aid that your own choice or ra&s;hne&s;s engaged you in them; &s;o as to &s;ubject you to the &s;evere and &s;hame|ful puni&s;hments denounced again&s;t them, by the laws of your country in this world, and by the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t in the world to come.</P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to give the true meaning of the words&mdash;<HI>do violence to no man.</HI> I know there are &s;ome who affect to under|&s;tand them in a more unlimited &s;en&s;e; as containing a general prohibition of all Force and Arms what&s;oever. But, in this, they are neither warranted by Scripture nor
<PB N="12" REF="008042_0014_102E1C71B8AEE8F8">
Rea&s;on. Nay, the very rever&s;e is evi|dent from the text it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE Soldiers, whom &s;aint John addre&s;&s;es, received wages for Fighting and Bearing arms again&s;t the enemies of their country. He expre&s;&s;ly enjoins them to be content with tho&s;e wages. But this he never would have done, if the Service, which they performed as the condition of the wages, had been that identical Violence, which he &s;o &s;trongly prohibits in the former part of the ver&s;e. They mu&s;t indeed be very daringly bold, who can charge the Spirit of God with &s;uch an ab&s;urdity!</P>
<P>BUT the fact is that&mdash;to &s;upport Ju&s;tice, to maintain Truth, to defend the goods of Providence, to repre&s;s the wild fury of lawle&s;s Invaders, and by main force, if po&s;&s;ible, to extirpate Oppre&s;&s;ion and Wickedne&s;s from the earth&mdash;this has never been accounted Violence in any language or
<PB N="13" REF="008042_0015_102E1C741880FAD0">
country. On the contrary, it is Duty to the public, and Mercy to thou&s;ands!</P>
<P>IF Society is of God's appointment, every thing e&s;&s;ential to its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence mu&s;t be &s;o too; for he that ordains the End, ordains the Means. But how &s;hall Society &s;ub&s;i&s;t, if we are to &s;ubmit to the un|righteous encroachments of every re&s;tle&s;s Invader? if we are tamely to be plundered, tortured, ma&s;&s;acred and de&s;troy'd by tho&s;e who covet our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions! has God given us his Go&s;pel, endowed us with rea&s;on, and made us fit for Society, only to put us in a wor&s;e condition than the roaming Savage, or the Bea&s;t of prey?</P>
<P>WE all allow, in common ca&s;es, that a public Robber may be &s;ubdued by force or death, if other means fail. We grant al&s;o that tho&s;e who invade private property may be compelled to re&s;titution at the bar of Ju&s;tice. But if independent &s;tates have injured us, to what Bar &s;hall we cite
<PB N="14" REF="008042_0016_102E1C76C9A12238">
them? who &s;hall con&s;train them to appear at our &s;ummons? or, if they &s;hould appear, who &s;hall oblige them to abide by the &s;entence? open Force, then, mu&s;t be the dernier re&s;ort. And &s;trange it is that tho&s;e who are often &s;o litigious in ca&s;es of private right, &s;hould affect to be mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ive in what concerns the Rights of the Community!</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, if human Societies are in&s;ti|tuted for any end at all, independent States may not only <HI>defend</HI> their Rights when invaded; but if they are already deprived or defrauded of them, they may demand re&s;titution in the loude&s;t and mo&s;t impor|tunate manner; even by calling for it in Thunder at the very gates of their enemy. This is often the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t mer|ciful method. Nor is it doing Violence to our neighbours, but ju&s;tice to our&s;elves, and to the cau&s;e of Right, Liberty, Virtue and public Safety; which would otherwi&s;e be left unavoidably to &s;uffer.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="008042_0017_102E1C7926A0C370">IT were indeed &s;incerely to be wi&s;hed that the Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us might have &s;uch an univer&s;al influence on the lives of all men, as to render it no more nece&s;&s;ity to learn the art of war. But alas! this is a degree of perfection not to be hoped for in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, and only to be look'd for in the kingdom of univer&s;al Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Were all men arrived to &s;uch a degree of goodne&s;s as to render force unnece&s;&s;ary, then al&s;o the Magi&s;tracy, the Laws and every thing el&s;e belonging to particular Societies in this world, would be a needle&s;s In&s;titution. But as long as particular Societies are of any u&s;e, &s;o long will Force and Arms be of u&s;e. For the very end of &s;uch Societies is to unite the Force of Individuals, for obtaining &s;afety to the whole.</P>
<P>WHAT I have already &s;aid will con|vince every rea&s;onable per&s;on that the words&mdash;do violence to no man&mdash;were never meant as a general prohibition of all Force and Arms; &s;o often nece&s;&s;ary in this embara&s;&s;ed &s;cene of things. As for tho&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="008042_0018_102E1C7B8759D218">
who from views of intere&s;t, pretended &s;cruples of con&s;cience and I know not what prejudices of education, &s;till &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the cleare&s;t light, I do not pretend to offer arguments for their conviction.</P>
<P>IF the barbarities that have been committed around them; if the cries of their murdered and &s;uffering brethren; if their country &s;wimming in blood and involved in an expen&s;ive war&mdash;if the&s;e things have not already pierced their &s;tony hearts and convinced their deluded rea&s;on, that their Principles are ab&s;urd in Idea and criminal in Practice, I am &s;ure any thing I might &s;ay farther, would have but little weight. I &s;hall only beg leave to remind them, that they will have this cau&s;e to plead one day more before a Tribunal, where &s;ubterfuges will &s;tand them in no &s;tead; and where it will be well if they are acquit|ted, and no part of the blood that has been &s;pilt is required <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> their hands.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="008042_0019_102E1C7DED6D8828">HAVING found it nece&s;&s;ary to dwell &s;o long on the former part of the text, I &s;hall be very brief on what remains. The Chri&s;tian-&s;oldier is forbid, in the SECOND PLACE, to <HI>accu&s;e any man fal&s;ely.</HI></P>
<P>TO circumvent, to bear down, or to take away, the character of another, for the &s;ake of revenge, profit or preferment, is indeed a crime of the mo&s;t unpardonable nature. It &s;eldom admits of any reparation, and &s;trikes at the very root of all peace and faith and &s;ociety among men. Surely, then, among a &s;ociety of Soldiers, who&s;e &s;trength con&s;i&s;ts in their Harmony, and who&s;e peculiar character is their <HI>Honor</HI> and <HI>Veracity,</HI> &s;uch a pernicious vice &s;hould be di&s;couraged in an eminent degree, as tending to their immediate ruin, and odious both to God and Man.</P>
<P>IN the THIRD and la&s;t place, the Chri&s;tian-&s;oldier is to be <HI>content with his wages.</HI> This is al&s;o a very e&s;&s;ential duty. Nothing ought to be more inviolable among men than the performance of their
<PB N="18" REF="008042_0020_102E1C80514802E0">
Covenants. Now, between the Briti&s;h State and its Soldiery, there is a Covenant of the mo&s;t &s;acred nature. They volun|tarily enli&s;t into a certain &s;ervice for cer|tain wages. The&s;e wages are &s;ufficient for a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The Briti&s;h Government has Mercy in its whole na|ture, and all its appointments are liberal. The wages of our common Soldiery are almo&s;t equal to tho&s;e of the inferior officers in many other &s;ervices. Surely then, for them, above all others, to be di&s;contented with the&s;e wages, to neglect the duty an|nexed to them, or to be faint-hearted in its performance, would argue the highe&s;t ba&s;ene&s;s. It would be breach of Faith, breach of Honor, and a total want of every generous affection.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, to be <HI>content</HI> with one's <HI>wages</HI> implies al&s;o a faithful application of them to the u&s;es for which they are given. They are not to be &s;pent in riot and intempe|rance, but in keeping the body neat, clean, healthy and vigorous for the di&s;|charge of its duty. Na&s;tine&s;s and &s;loven|line&s;s

in dre&s;s or behaviour are &s;ure marks of a mean and da&s;tardly temper. The man who di&s;regards the care of his own per&s;on, which is the Image of his Maker, can have neither &s;pirit nor grace nor virtue in him. It will be almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to exalt his groveling Soul to the performance of any great or heroic action.</P>
<P>AND as for Intemperance, in a Soldier, a Vice of more ruinous con&s;equence can|not well be imagined; or rather it is a complication of all vices. For, not to &s;ay that it generally leads to tho&s;e acts of Vio|lence &s;o fully mentioned above, it is in it&s;elf a manife&s;t violation of every tie between the Soldier and his country. The Soldier, by the terms of his enli&s;tment, con&s;igns his health, &s;trength and &s;ervice to the public, in con&s;ideration of his receiving certain wages. Now for him to &s;pend tho&s;e wages in enervating or de&s;troying that very health and &s;trength for which they are given&mdash;what is it? It is robbery of the public! nay De&s;ertion it&s;elf
<PB N="20" REF="008042_0022_102E1C856BC23D70">
is not a greater crime; and nothing but the mercy of our laws, in compa&s;&s;ion to the frail|ties of human nature, could have made the puni&s;hment of the one le&s;s than that of the other. For a Soldier may as well be found ab&s;ent from his po&s;t, or a&s;leep on it, as be found on it in a condition which renders him unfit for the duties of it. Indeed, Di&s;content, Sloth, Murmuring and Intem|perance, have been the bane of many a powerful army, and have often drawn down the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, by giving them up to certain ruin.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then, we may conclude from the text, that the particular Duty of Chri&s;tian Soldiers con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in&mdash; <HI>Obedience</HI> to tho&s;e who are appointed to command them; a re&s;pectful inoffen&s;ive behaviour to tho&s;e who &s;upport and main|tain them; &s;trict <HI>Honor</HI> and un&s;haken <HI>Veracity</HI> towards one another; Tempe|rance, Sobriety, Cleanline&s;s and Content|ment in their private character; and a
<PB N="21" REF="008042_0023_102E1C87EFAE92D0">
&s;teady, bold and chearful di&s;charge of whatever &s;ervice their King and Country may require of them.</P>
<P>I &s;aid that the&s;e things con&s;titute the particular duty of Soldiers, con&s;idered as &s;uch. But here let it be remembered, that no parti|cular injunctions of this kind to any particular order of men as &s;uch, exempt them from the general precepts of the Go&s;pel. Tho' the text be addre&s;s'd particularly to the Soldiers, con|&s;idered in that character; yet as they are al&s;o <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Creatures of God,</HI> they are equally called (in the eleventh ver&s;e for in&s;tance) to the practice of univer&s;al Benevolence and Charity with the whole body of the people, whereof they are a part, and to whom that ver&s;e is immediately addre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>THUS I have fini&s;h'd what I propos'd from the text. And now, Gentlemen <HI>Officers,</HI> you will permit me to addre&s;s the remainder of this di&s;cour&s;e more par|ticularly to you. I know you love your

<P>IF, then, you would de&s;ire to have any tie upon the Con&s;ciences of the&s;e men; if you would wi&s;h to &s;ee them act upon principle, and give you any other hold of them than that of mere Command&mdash;let me, Oh let me be&s;eech you, to cultivate and propagate among them, with your whole influence and authority, a &s;ublime &s;en&s;e of <HI>Religion, Eternity</HI> and <HI>Redeeming-love!</HI> Let the bright pro&s;pects of the <HI>Go&s;pel of Je&s;us</HI> be placed full before their eyes; and let its holy precepts be inculcated fre|quently into their hearts!</P>
<P>BUT oh! above all things, let the ado|rable name of the everla&s;ting Jehovah be kept &s;acred among you! Glorified angels fall pro&s;trate before it! The very devils them&s;elves tremble at it! And &s;hall poor

<P>ALAS! when the Name of our <HI>great Creator</HI> is become thus familiar, and pro&s;ti|tuted to every common &s;ubject, what Name &s;hall we invoke in the day of danger? to what refuge &s;hall we fly amid&s;t the various pre&s;&s;ures of life? to who&s;e mercy &s;hall we lift up our eyes in the hour of death? and into who&s;e bo&s;om con&s;ign our &s;ouls, when we launch forth into the dark precincts of Eternity?</P>
<P>ONCE more, then, let the Name of the Lord be holy among you; el&s;e have you no &s;ure foundation for Virtue or
