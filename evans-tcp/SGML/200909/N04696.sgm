<P>And after all that is come upon us for our evil Deeds, and for our great Tre&s;pa&s;s, &s;eeing that Thou our <HI>GOD</HI> ha&s;t puni&s;hed us le&s;s than our Iniquities <HI>de&s;erve,</HI> and ha&s;t given us <HI>&s;uch</HI> Deliverance as This; &s;hould we again brake thy Commandments, and join in Affinity with the People of the&s;e Abominations? would&s;t not Thou be angry with us 'till Thou had&s;t con&s;umed <HI>us,</HI> &s;o that <HI>there &s;hould be</HI> no Remnant nor E&s;caping?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THEY are the Words of <HI>Ezra</HI> in an Addre&s;s to GOD in Behalf of the delivered Remnant of the ancient <HI>I&s;raelites:</HI> Wherein He (1) owns their peculiar Relation to Him as <HI>their</HI> GOD in <HI>Covenant,</HI> their unworthy Carriage towards Him in their evil Deeds and great Tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t Him, his having righteou&s;ly cha&s;tized them therefor by various Judgments, and yet his Exerci&s;e of Mercy in puni&s;hing them le&s;s than their Iniquities

de&s;erved, yea, his wondrous Goodne&s;s in giving them a mo&s;t unde&s;erved and <HI>inexpre&s;&s;ibly Great Deliverance;</HI> and then (2) He by Implication or awakening Que&s;tions owns, that after all This, for them to brake his Commandments again, and join in Affinity with the People of the&s;e Abominations [i. e. of impious Idolaters] would be a mo&s;t mon&s;trous, aggravated and provoking Sin, which might ju&s;tly move Him to di&s;play his Anger in their utter Ruin.</P>
<P>And how exceeding applicable are the &s;ame Hi&s;tories and Rea&s;onings to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nations and their depending <HI>Colonies?</HI></P>
<P>But as the MOST HIGH has lately given us &s;uch a <HI>Great Deliverance</HI> in the <HI>happy</HI> VICTORY over the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s <HI>Party</HI> in the <HI>North</HI> of SCOTLAND, and we are e&s;pecially called this Day to adore and Prai&s;e our DIVINE DELIVERER therefor with the livelie&s;t Thankfulne&s;s and Admiration; it &s;eems highly proper to con&s;ider the&s;e <HI>Four</HI> Particulars&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Who this <HI>dangerous Per&s;on</HI> is, and who are <HI>his Adherents and Abettors.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>mi&s;chievous Con&s;equence</HI> of his obtaining his De&s;igns.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>great Danger</HI> of his &s;ucceeding in his late Enter|prize.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Some of the <HI>&s;ignal Appearances</HI> of GOD for us in <HI>this great Deliverance.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Great Deliverance</HI> is a General Term which comprehends a great Variety and Number of Particulars; both all the Evils delivered from, the Cau&s;es &amp; Danger of them, and the Way and Means of our Deliverance. But General Terms affect us not &s;o much as the mention of Particulars. As the Term&mdash; <HI>Redemption by</HI> CHRIST would neither move nor enlighten, unle&s;s we con&s;ider the particular Evils we are &s;ubject to and redeemed from, together with the particular Author, Way and Means of our Redemption. And He thinks not deeply in Religion, nor is duly engaged in it, who contents Him&s;elf with General Terms, without viewing the Particulars included
<PB N="7" REF="005857_0005_102701FF2A434A48">
in them wherein He is greatly concerned: His Under&s;tand|ing is neither duly clear, nor can his Heart be &s;uitably affected.</P>
<P>And in <HI>the important Ca&s;e before us</HI>&mdash;How can we be duly Thankful to or admire and prai&s;e our DIVINE DELIVERER, unle&s;s we are duly Sen&s;ible of the <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> of our <HI>Danger</HI> and <HI>Deliverance?</HI> And how can we be duly Sen&s;ible of the&s;e, unle&s;s we take a particular View of the <HI>mi&s;chievous Con&s;equence</HI> of <HI>the Head</HI> of our Enemies &s;ucceeding, or the dreadful Mi&s;e|ries we are delivered from? And how can we be apprehen&s;ive of tho&s;e, unle&s;s we con&s;ider his <HI>Education, Principles, Intere&s;ts, Adherents</HI> and <HI>Abettors?</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hould be as particular therefore as the Hour allows, and view each Particular as a <HI>Part</HI> of the wondrous <HI>Chain</HI> of <HI>Providence</HI> comprehended in our Great Deliverance, and as a <HI>particular Motive</HI> of our pious Admiration, Thankfulne&s;s and Prai&s;e: E&s;pecially con&s;idering every In&s;tance is under the <HI>Government</HI> of the SON of GOD as <HI>Mediator,</HI> made &s;ub&s;ervient to his glorious Purpo&s;es, is a Fulfillment of his Will and Word, and a Means of di&s;playing his adorable Perfections; yea my intire Subject will be a Part of the Execution of <HI>his Kingly Office</HI> among the Sons of Men.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, they act too much like <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI> who view the&s;e Things as a meer Piece of News, or the meer Operations of created Cau&s;es, to plea&s;e their vain Curio&s;ity, and don't religiou&s;ly behold them as the Works of GOD in Providence: And they don't act like <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> who don't in the Exerci&s;e of Faith behold them as the <HI>Providential Works</HI> of our exalted SAVIOUR in the Rule of the World.</P>
<P>With &s;uch believing and religious Views as the&s;e, let us then con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">I. Who this <HI>dangerous Per&s;on</HI> is, and who are <HI>his Adherents and Abettors,</HI> which the righteous GOD has rai&s;ed up to mole&s;t and threaten us.</P>
<P>Now, He is called <HI>the Pretender,</HI> not &s;o much becau&s;e he pre|tends to be the Son of King JAMES II; as becau&s;e he pretends in
<PB N="8" REF="005857_0006_10270203B1D6B290">
Oppo&s;ition to all the Rights, Laws and Con&s;titutions of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, to be their Sovereign.</P>
<P>In 1623, his pretended Grandfather Prince <HI>Charles</HI> after|wards King CHARLES I, &s;olliciting a Match with a <HI>Spani&s;h Papi&s;t,</HI> Si&s;ter of the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> in his Letter to the <HI>Pope</HI> declared, <Q>He would never &s;o vehemently de&s;ire to be joined in a &s;trict and indi&s;&s;oluble Bond with any Mortal what&s;o|ever who&s;e Religion he hated:</Q> And tho' the <HI>Hou&s;e of Com|mons</HI> repre&s;ented the mi&s;chievous Influence of a <HI>popi&s;h</HI> Match, and the great Importance of marrying a <HI>Prote&s;tant;</HI> yet <HI>two</HI> Years after, coming to the Crown, he forthwith married a <HI>French Papi&s;t,</HI> Si&s;ter of King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII of <HI>France,</HI> which was the pernicious Fountain of almo&s;t all the Mi&s;eries of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nations ever &s;ince. Of <HI>this popi&s;h Match,</HI> in 1630, was born Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> afterwards King CHARLES II; and in 1633, the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> afterwards King JAMES II: And by the Articles of Marriage they were educated by their popi&s;h Mother 'till they were <HI>ten</HI> Years old; and then the <HI>civil Wars</HI> between the <HI>Parliament</HI> and their <HI>Father,</HI> beginning in 1641, 2 and ending in 1646, they followed their <HI>popi&s;h Mo|ther</HI> into <HI>France,</HI> where they chiefly &s;ojourn'd with her 'till 1660: When King CHARLES II being re&s;tored, he <HI>two</HI> Years after married a <HI>Portuge&s;e Papi&s;t,</HI> Si&s;ter of the King of <HI>Portugal.</HI> About 1670, the &s;aid Duke of <HI>York</HI> declar'd Him|&s;elf a Papi&s;t, and appear'd the Patron and Head of their Party; in 1673, in Oppo&s;ition to Two Addre&s;&s;es of the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> He married an <HI>Italian Papi&s;t,</HI> Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Modena;</HI> and in <HI>Feb.</HI> 1684, 5, He &s;ucceeded his &s;aid Bro|ther to the Throne. And thus the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation had none but <HI>Popi&s;h Queens</HI> for above <HI>Sixty-three Years</HI> together: Nor had ever any <HI>King</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Stuarts</HI> a <HI>Prote&s;tant Queen,</HI> except King JAMES I.</P>
<P>When King JAMES II. came to the Crown, He publi&s;h'd <HI>his Brother</HI>'s private Papers to &s;how that <HI>He</HI> was a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> al&s;o: But to quiet the People and rock them into Security, He fir&s;t to his <HI>Privy Council</HI> and then to the <HI>Parliament</HI> Promi&s;ed, and Printed his <HI>Promi&s;es,</HI> to maintain the national Liberties, Properties, Laws and Con&s;titutions, and prove Him&s;elf a merciful and tender Prince: Yet quickly broke them all;

in Defiance of the Laws, making <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> both Officers in his Army, Superiour Judges, and Privy Councillors, taking even a known <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> Father <HI>Peters,</HI> into his Privy Council; wholly following their Advice; and, as the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tories and Par|liaments have told us, by numberle&s;s arbitrary illegal and cruel Actions, &s;preading Popery, Slavery and De&s;truction; was not only ruining the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, but even de|&s;troy'd the very e&s;&s;ential Ends of Government, forfeited his Crown, made his Reign intolerable: And having but <HI>two Children</HI> living and they <HI>Daughters</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> the one the Prince&s;s MARY married to <HI>William</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> the other the Prince&s;s ANN married to Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Den|mark;</HI> in order to entail, increa&s;e and compleat the national Mi&s;ery, his Popi&s;h Queen was &s;aid to bring forth <HI>this Pre|tended Son</HI> in <HI>June</HI> 1688: Tho' the Nation for many weighty Rea&s;ons had both before, at the &s;ame Time and after, a ge|neral Su&s;picion of Forgery therein: And at his <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> Him&s;elf, repre&s;ented by his <HI>Nuncio,</HI> was his <HI>Godfather,</HI> and the <HI>Popi&s;h Widow</HI> of King CHARLES II. <HI>Godmother;</HI> it being highly improper that any <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Princes &s;hould be Spon&s;ors, for one who was de&s;ign'd to be the Great Main|tainer of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>Upon this, many of the Heads of the Nation, in the Pro|&s;pect of their univer&s;al and total Ruin, inviting over the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> under GOD to come and &s;ave them; the Prince in <HI>Nov.</HI> 1688, landed with an Army in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> of ENGLAND: And many of the Chief of the Kingdom re|pairing to Him, King JAMES &s;ent his &s;aid <HI>Popi&s;h Queen</HI> with <HI>this Pretended Son</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and &s;oon after followed. On this happy Revolution, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> being under GOD the Saviour of the Nation, was righteou&s;ly made <HI>King</HI> and his Prince&s;s <HI>Queen</HI> by the then different Parliaments of ENGLAND and SCOTLAND, by the Name of King WIL|LIAM and Queen MARY: And Queen <HI>Mary</HI> dying with|out I&s;&s;ue in 1694, and the Prince&s;s <HI>Ann</HI>'s I&s;&s;ue dying in 1700; King WILLIAM by an Act of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parlia|ment, got the De&s;cent of the Crown, upon the &s;ailing of Her I&s;&s;ue and of his own, &s;ettled on the Prote&s;tant Prince&s;s SOPHIA Electre&s;s Dowager of <HI>Hanover</HI> Grandaughter of King JAMES I, and <HI>her Prote&s;tant Off-&s;pring;</HI> &s;he being the

<HI>next Prote&s;tant</HI> of the <HI>Royal Blood</HI> of ENGLAND. King WILLIAM reigned gloriou&s;ly to <HI>March</HI> 1701, 2: When dying, the &s;aid Prince&s;s ANN became our <HI>Queen</HI> and reign'd to <HI>Aug.</HI> 1714: And then decea&s;ing, as the Prince&s;s SOPHIA had in <HI>June</HI> before, the ELECTOR of HANOVER her elde&s;t Son &s;ucceeded by the Name of King GEORGE I: Who reign'd to <HI>June</HI> 1727; and then HIS ONLY SON, our pre&s;ent King &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Under the happy Reigns of the&s;e <HI>four</HI> Prote&s;tant and mo&s;t gracious SOVEREIGNS, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nations have enjoyed &s;uch Civil and Religious Liberty, Trade, Wealth and Pro|&s;perity, as they never knew before; and wherein they have been and are, incomparably happier than any other People on the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>But King JAMES II, with his &s;aid <HI>Queen</HI> and <HI>pretended Son</HI> lived in <HI>France,</HI> and were maintained by King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV; who did his utmo&s;t, by joining the Popi&s;h Party in IRE|LAND, attempting to make De&s;cents in ENGLAND, and A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations of King WILLIAM both in ENGLAND and FLANDERS, to re&s;tore the abdicated King to his tyrannical and vengeful Power over us 'till <HI>Sept.</HI> 1701, when He decea&s;ed: And then the <HI>French King</HI> Proclaim'd <HI>this Popi&s;h Pretender</HI> King of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> by the Name of <HI>James</HI> III, in Defiance of King WILLIAM our Great De|liverer, and the Parliaments and Laws of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King|doms.</P>
<P>King WILLIAM dying in 1701, 2, and the Prince&s;s ANN &s;ucceeding; the Year after, a Con&s;piracy began in SCOTLAND in behalf of <HI>this Pretender,</HI> to dethrone Her: But was &s;oon di&s;covered and cru&s;hed. In <HI>May</HI> 1706, Queen ANN accompli&s;hed an happy <HI>Union</HI> of the two Kingdoms of ENGLAND and SCOTLAND into <HI>one,</HI> by the Name of GREAT BRITAIN. And in <HI>March</HI> 1707, 8, <HI>this Pretender</HI> with a <HI>French</HI> Fleet and Troops &s;ail'd from <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Edinburg</HI> to &s;eize the Kingdom: But in a Day or two after their Arrival, were by Admiral BYNG obliged to fly and return.</P>

<P>In <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1715, King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV of <HI>France</HI> dying, the <HI>Pretender</HI> was oblig'd in <HI>February</HI> 1716, 17, to retire to <HI>Rome:</HI> Where or near it He has lived almo&s;t ever &s;ince; married a <HI>Poli&s;h Papi&s;t,</HI> and had <HI>two Sons</HI> by Her, yet alive.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Beginning</HI> of 1717, the Government was threatened with an Inva&s;ion by the then King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> attended with an In&s;urrection of this <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Friends in GREAT BRI|TAIN: But the Project being timely di&s;covered, was quickly di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Spring</HI> of 1719, the <HI>Pretender</HI> was received at <HI>Ma|drid</HI> with all the Honours of a crowned Head by the King of <HI>Spain:</HI> Who declar'd him King of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND and IRELAND, engaged in another Inva&s;ion for Him, and on a &s;udden &s;ent a Fleet and Armament for GREAT BRI|TAIN: But a mighty Storm for <HI>nineteen</HI> Days together di&s;|per&s;ed them.

<P>In <HI>June</HI> 1727, King GEORGE I. Decea&s;ing, his only Son King GEORGE II. happily &s;ucceeded, and reigned &s;everal Years in great Quiet and Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Yet in the <HI>Winter</HI> of 1743, 4, the <HI>French</HI> King in a Time of Peace with us, fitted out another Fleet at <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> and <HI>Dun|kirk,</HI> with <HI>Sixteen Thou&s;and</HI> Troops, and va&s;t Quantities of Arms, &amp;c; unexpectedly and &s;uddenly at the End of <HI>Feb|ruary,</HI> in perfidious Breach of all his &s;olemn Treaties, &s;ent them to invade the Kingdom for this <HI>Pretender,</HI> to the great Surprize of the Nation, while we were too &s;ecure and un|prepared: And having &s;ent them forth, proclaim'd Him our King and declared War again&s;t us. But ju&s;t, as many of them arriv'd on the <HI>Southern</HI> Coa&s;t of ENGLAND and others were come out of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> before they had Time to join and land; GOD was pleas'd to rai&s;e another mighty Storm again&s;t them, which di&s;pers'd and drove 'em away, de&s;troy'd diver&s;e Ships, drowned many Troops, and in one Day confounded this threatning Enterprize.</P>
<P>But our inveterate and <HI>popi&s;h</HI> Enemies both without and within the Kingdom, are re&s;tle&s;s to en&s;lave and ruin us.</P>
<P>For about <HI>twelve Months ago,</HI> the <HI>Pretender</HI> &s;ent his elde&s;t Son <HI>Charles</HI> in the 26th Year of his Age thro' <HI>France,</HI> with the <HI>pretended Title</HI> of <HI>Regent</HI> in his Name of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, and IRELAND, to make another Attempt to gain the Throne, and bring the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nations to mi&s;erable Popery and Slavery in Subjection to Him.

<P N="13">13.

When the ELECTOR of HANOVER came to the Throne, the general Di&s;affection &s;oon appeared, both among the People, Clergy and other Gentry, and even in one of the Univer&s;ities: Some of the late <HI>Tory Mini&s;try</HI> fled to <HI>France;</HI> and &s;ome others rais'd a <HI>Rebellion</HI> in SCOTLAND, which cou'd not be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed 'till the Arrival of <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops from <HI>Hol|land:</HI> Yea &s;o great was the Prejudice, that for the mo&s;t Part of the Reign of King GEORGE I, tho' one of the be&s;t of Prin|ces, Con&s;piracies were almo&s;t continually formed again&s;t Him, and the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament</HI> judg'd it needful for the Safety of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> to keep up an Army of about <HI>Twenty

<P N="5">5. Ever &s;ince the ELECTOR of HANOVER came to the Crown, there have been great Numbers of plainly <HI>Jacobite</HI> News-papers and hi&s;torical and political Books and Pamphlets continually publi&s;hed, di&s;per&s;ed thro' and poi&s;oning the Nation; writing ju&s;t as the <HI>Jacobites, Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>French Court</HI> wou'd have 'em;&mdash;under popular and plau&s;ible Colours, traducing the Mini&s;try, vilifying all their Admini&s;trations, reviling the be&s;t and greate&s;t Friends of the <HI>Hanover Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> rendring the very Name of <HI>Hanover</HI> odious, and increa&s;ing the Di&s;affection of the People to that illu&s;trious <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> to a very dangerous Degree &amp; Extent; 'till it's Enemies apprehended the Nation ready to de&s;ert it, or grown indifferent to it: While the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> increa&s;ed in LONDON and WESTMIN|STER, were repre&s;ented as having lo&s;t their per&s;ecuting Spirit and Principles, and being become a harmle&s;s People to <HI>Pro|te&s;tants:</HI> And then the <HI>French King</HI> &s;ends to <HI>Rome</HI> for the <HI>Young Pretender:</HI> And preparing <HI>Sixteen Thou&s;and</HI> Troops, with va&s;t Quantities of Arms, &amp;c; in <HI>Feb.</HI> 1743, 4, even a|bove <HI>ten Days</HI> before he declares War again&s;t us, &s;uddenly &s;ends them forth to introduce Him into the Kingdom; tho' a Storm from Heaven, as we ob&s;erved before, delivers us.</P>
<P N="6">6. To lull the hone&s;t Part of the Nation into a deep Secu|rity, the great and mo&s;t dangerous Artifice of our unwearied Enemies; the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> both Writers and others as u&s;ual, laugh at the Mention of a de&s;ign'd Inva&s;ion, treat it as a meer Chimera, as if there were no &s;uch Thing intended, but only a Feint to frighten us: And upon their happy Defeat, we &s;eem to grow &s;o &s;ecure again; as it is &s;aid in the publick Prints, that of but <HI>Twelve Thou&s;and</HI> Troops in the Kingdom, <HI>Half</HI> are &s;ent over in the <HI>Spring</HI> of 1745 to <HI>Flanders,</HI> and but <HI>Six Thou&s;and</HI> left to defend the Throne.</P>

<P N="9">9. Now indeed &s;eems a Sea&s;on of di&s;mal Danger.

<P N="10">10. This is al&s;o in a hazardous Sea&s;on on this Account; That by the unhappy Conduct of the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> even after the Queen of <HI>Hungary</HI> had by the Treaty of <HI>Bre&s;law</HI> yielded Him the <HI>Lower Sile&s;ia,</HI> yet invading her other Domi|nions; whereby &s;he was hindered from &s;upplying her Army in the <HI>Au&s;trian Netherlands,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> with their va&s;tly &s;upe|riour Armies had carried almo&s;t all <HI>Flanders</HI> before them, taken the Barrier Cities between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and were ju&s;t at the <HI>Dutch</HI> Frontiers: Whereby we lo&s;t the Ad|vantage of the Barrier Treaty, (which our Enemies well knew) our Allies the <HI>Dutch</HI> were in &s;o dangerous a Ca&s;e, that they could not tell how to le&s;&s;en their Troops to help us; nor <HI>they</HI> nor the Queen of <HI>Hungary</HI> to &s;pare the DUKE and <HI>ours,</HI> to leave their Countries open to re&s;i&s;tle&s;s De&s;olations.</P>
<P N="11">11. This is al&s;o a Time of Year, when the Wind in the <HI>Briti&s;h Channel</HI> is wont to blow from the <HI>we&s;terly</HI> Quarter: Which threatens to hinder the the DUKE and his Troops, as well as the <HI>Dutch</HI> and other of our Friends in <HI>Europe,</HI> their Countries all lying to the Ea&s;tward, from coming over to help us in this Emergency; but at the &s;ame Time wou'd give a fair Opportunity for our <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Enemies to pour in upon us, who were al&s;o prepared and watching for it.</P>

not to be refus'd on Pain of military Execution; &s;up|plies his Army with Cloathing, Food, Hor&s;e, and Money, aug|ments it to <HI>Ten Thou&s;and;</HI> plunders and wa&s;tes the Countrey all around Him; receives Recruits of Officers, Ammunition, Money and Arms from <HI>France;</HI> and divers other <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Lords and Gentlemen join Him. About <HI>November</HI> 3, with an Army of <HI>Nine Thou&s;and,</HI> He leaves <HI>that Capital,</HI> marches thro' the <HI>we&s;terly</HI> Road to ENGLAND: Saturday Night <HI>Nov.</HI> 9. arrives at <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> her northermo&s;t City, Lord's Day Mor|ning orders it to yeild, and <HI>Nov.</HI> 15 takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Thence He marches unmole&s;ted thro' the Counties of <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Lanca&s;hire, Che&s;hire</HI> and into <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> 'till <HI>December</HI> 4, when with <HI>&s;ix Lords</HI> and above <HI>&s;even Thau&s;and Soldiers</HI> He enters <HI>Derby</HI> the chief Town of the Shire and in the Heart of ENGLAND, but about a <HI>Hundred Miles</HI> North of LONDON.

<P>And thus far the Danger &s;eems to grow: And yet that which adds to all, alas, is the prodigious <HI>Luxury, Debauchery</HI> and <HI>Prophane&s;s</HI> of the Nation, which &s;eem to render us ripe for entire De&s;truction; yea, as we are told in the publick Prints, the amazing and provoking <HI>Infidelity, Impenitence</HI> and <HI>Sotti&s;hne&s;s</HI> of the Bulk of the People, even while on the very Brink of univer&s;al Ruin. How cou'd we conceive any other than of the Holy GOD as now looking down upon us with &s;uch awful Tho'ts of Re&s;entment as in Jer. v. 9, 29. <HI>Shall I not vi&s;it for the&s;e</HI> Things, <HI>&s;aith the</HI> LORD? <HI>Shall not my Soul be</HI> now <HI>avenged on &s;uch a Nation as this?</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>But tho' we &s;eem to be ripe, and the righteous GOD &s;eems in Providence to be preparing corre&s;pondent Cau&s;es for our &s;udden De&s;olation; yet his Ways are not as our's, nor his Tho'ts as our's, but as far above them as the Heavens above the Earth: And when we come to tremble as a Bird out of

<P>We now therefore come in the</P>
<P N="4">IVth and la&s;t Place&punc; to view &s;ome of the <HI>&s;ignal Appearances</HI> of the MOST HIGH for us in <HI>this great Deliverance.</HI></P>
<P>And here among many Others we may ob&s;erve the follow|ing&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. It was, even before, remarkable and happy for us, that when the <HI>Young Pretender</HI> was &s;ailing, unknown to us, from <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> to the <HI>North We&s;t</HI> of SCOTLAND in a &s;maller Ship of <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> Guns, but in Company with a <HI>&s;ixty-four</HI> Gun Man of War, loaden with Soldiers, Officers, Provi&s;ion, Ammunition, Arms and Money; His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Ship the <HI>Lion</HI> of <HI>fifty-eight</HI> Guns, Capt. <HI>Brett</HI> Commander, &s;hou'd on <HI>July</HI> 9, but <HI>four Days</HI> after their leaving <HI>France,</HI> happen unde&s;ign'd, to meet them, and then &s;o warmly engage the <HI>Larger</HI> Ship, as to di&s;|able Her to proceed the Voyage and oblige Her to return to <HI>Bre&s;t:</HI> Whereby the <HI>young Pretender</HI> was forc'd to go on alone in the <HI>other,</HI> and lo&s;t a va&s;t Advantage at the fir&s;t of his Enterprize; there being Arms but for <HI>Five Hundred</HI> Men in the <HI>&s;maller</HI> Ship, but for <HI>Six Thou&s;and and Five Hundred</HI> in the <HI>Larger;</HI> for want of which he was much retarded; or wou'd have &s;upplied his Men as &s;oon as they join'd Him, and might have march'd to EDINBURGH and ENGLAND while the Roads were dry, and almo&s;t as &s;oon as we heard of his Arrival.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>French</HI> Court &s;eem'd infatuated, when they had <HI>&s;ix</HI> more Ships of <HI>&s;ixty,</HI> and <HI>one</HI> of <HI>&s;eventy</HI> Guns in <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> at the Time he &s;ail'd, that they &s;hou'd &s;end no more A&s;&s;i&s;tance with Him; and that upon their <HI>&s;ixty-four</HI> Gun Ship returning, they &s;hou'd not &s;end &s;ome others with Supplies immediately:

Whereby He might have made a much &s;wifter Progre&s;s.

<P N="3">3. When notwith&s;tanding all&mdash;The Pretender's Army had yet &s;urprizingly grown and gone on without Oppo&s;ition, en|ter'd the <HI>chief City</HI> of SCOTLAND, increa&s;ed to <HI>Eight Thou|&s;and,</HI> in a few Minutes beat the King's Forces, made them fly, killed many, and &s;pread a univer&s;al Con&s;ternation thro' the Kingdom; when we had no Troops return'd nor the DUKE from <HI>Flanders,</HI> and but <HI>&s;ix Thou&s;and</HI> at home to defend our KING and <HI>Capital;</HI> when &s;o many in ENGLAND were at that Time double&s;s ready to join them, if they had then flu&s;h'd with Victory march'd for <HI>London;</HI> and the <HI>young Pretender</HI> had &s;everal zealous able Generals and politick Coun&s;ellors; &mdash; It &s;eems a wonderful Thing to &s;ee the <HI>Infatuation</HI> upon <HI>them</HI> al&s;o, in neglecting to improve their Victory and &s;uch a fair Oppor|tunity, but returning to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and &s;taying there <HI>&s;ix Weeks,</HI> as if on purpo&s;e to afford us Time to prepare again&s;t them.</P>
<P N="4">4.

<P N="6">6.

And now while the <HI>young Pretender</HI> is in the Height of his Career and Hopes, arriving at <HI>Derby</HI> in the Heart of ENGLAND on <HI>December</HI> 4, and his triumphant Army bending their Cour&s;e for <HI>London</HI> to &s;eize the Throne; on <HI>Dec.</HI> 6, in the Morning, hearing that the DUKE and his Army of <HI>eleven</HI> Battalions of Foot, and <HI>&s;ix</HI> Regiments of Hor&s;e and Dragoons were arrived at <HI>Litchfield</HI> within <HI>twenty</HI> Miles, on the <HI>Evening before,</HI> a &s;udden Pannick &s;eizes the Hearts of our Enemies, who had heard of the Bravery of the DUKE and <HI>his Troops</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and well concluded it would rather ex|ceed on this great Occa&s;ion: For if they had fought &s;o brave|ly for the Defence of the Queen of <HI>Hungary</HI>'s Country, how much more wou'd their Spirits ri&s;e in Defence of <HI>their Own</HI> on the Brink of De&s;truction? And now how joyful to &s;ee the Rebels flying before Him, the DUKE pur&s;uing as far as <HI>Car|li&s;le,</HI> and at the End of the Month recovering the City.</P>
<P N="10">10. Now indeed their Progre&s;s &s;eems to be over; their Forces dwindled and divided, the Remainder an ea&s;y Conque&s;t for the other Generals with the Troops at <HI>Newca&s;tle:</HI> And as great Preparations are ready at <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and other neigh|bouring Ports of <HI>France</HI> to land an Army of <HI>twenty Thou&s;and</HI>

in the <HI>South</HI> of ENGLAND, the DUKE is recalled with &s;ome of his Troops to <HI>London,</HI> where he arrives on the 5th of <HI>Janu|ary.</HI> Upon which the Rebels rejoin, re&s;ume their Courage, <HI>Dec.</HI> 26 &s;eize the City of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> plunder the People, de|&s;troy their Goods, and recruit with Money, &amp;c; <HI>Jan.</HI> 3, march for <HI>Stirling,</HI> on the 8th enter the Gates, increa&s;e their Numbers to <HI>nine Thou&s;and</HI> again, receive Supplies from <HI>France,</HI> lay Siege to the Ca&s;tle; and on the 17th at <HI>Falkirk</HI> attack our Army, break our left Wing, and oblige us to burn our Tents and retire to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> But it &s;eems remarkable and happy for <HI>us,</HI> that the Rebels don't improve this great Advan|tage and pur&s;ue our broken Troops much di&s;abled thro' the Wetne&s;s of our Powder by a Storm of Rain blowing again&s;t us in the Time of Action, to re&s;i&s;t them; but in&s;tead of fol|lowing us, return to the Seige of the Ca&s;tle: And this is bravely defended by General <HI>Blakeney</HI> in the mo&s;t critical Sea|&s;on; it being a Fortre&s;s of va&s;t Importance, as it is the <HI>Key</HI> or Guard to the Land-Pa&s;&s;age between the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI> Parts of SCOTLAND.</P>
<P N="11">11.

<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 18 the Rebels enter <HI>Inverne&s;s:</HI> And there they gather again, with &s;ome fre&s;h Recruits from <HI>France,</HI> and &s;oon take Fort <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> and Fort <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> But the <HI>la&s;t</HI> of <HI>Feb.</HI> the DUKE arrives with his Army at <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> there &s;tays for his <HI>Cannon</HI> and other Recruits from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> 'till the bad Weather is over, the Snows are melted, the Roads pa&s;&s;able, and the Rivers fordable.

<P><HI>April</HI> 15, the DUKE compleats the <HI>Twenty-fifth</HI> Year of his Age; and the <HI>following Day</HI> goes on to the deci&s;ive Battle. And now the Necks of <HI>the Hor&s;e</HI> are cloathed with Thunder, the Glory of their No&s;trils is terrible; they paw in the Valley and rejoice in their Strength, they go on to meet the armed Men; they mock at Fear and are not affrighted, nor turn they back from the Sword; the Quiver rattleth again&s;t them, the glittering Spear and the Shield; they &s;wallow the Ground with Fiercene&s;s and Rage; they &s;ay among the Trumpets, Ha, Ha; they &s;mell the Battle afar off, the Thunder of the Captains and the Shouting: As GOD&punc; their Former repre&s;ents them in <HI>Job</HI> xxxix,</P>
<P>And here the <HI>following</HI> among other Particulars &s;eem re|markable: &mdash; That the DUKE advances toward our Enemies &s;ooner than they expected &mdash; That in the very order of Battle and Way of Attack, <HI>their</HI> able <HI>Generals</HI> appear greatly mi&s;ta|ken, but the DUKE and <HI>his</HI> to be guided with wondrous Wi&s;dom &mdash; That the Enemy's <HI>Cannon</HI> &s;hoot over the Heads of

<P>Let our triumphant and happy KING continue the Song to GOD, as in the <HI>following Ver&s;es;</HI> &mdash; <Q>Thou ha&s;t delivered me from the Strivings of the People: Thou ha&s;t made me the Head of the Nations: The Strangers &s;hall &s;ubmit them|&s;elves unto me; the Strangers &s;hall fade away, and be afraid out of their clo&s;e Places: The LORD liveth, and ble&s;&s;ed be my Rock, and let the GOD of my Salvation be exalted: It is GOD that avengeth me, and &s;ubdueth the People un|der me: He delivereth me from mine Enemies; yea Thou lifte&s;t me up above tho&s;e that ri&s;e up again&s;t me; Thou ha&s;t delivered me from the violent Man: Therefore will I give Thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the Nations, and &s;ing Prai&s;es to Thy Name: Great Deliverance giveth He to his King; and &s;heweth Mercy to his Anointed, and to his Seed for evermore.</Q></P>

ea&s;ily and clearly &s;ee our awakening Danger, from his &s;ignal Conduct to <HI>that peculiar People</HI> refer'd to in the <HI>Text:</HI> Who for many hundred Years were highly favoured by Him a|bove all others in the Earth.
