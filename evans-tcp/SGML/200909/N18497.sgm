<HEAD>ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>THE external name of Free Ma&s;on does not entitle man to u&s;urp any authority, or claim any re&s;pect from his fellow, without he &s;trictly conforms to the &s;alutary laws and re&s;tric|tions, on which our my&s;tery is founded. There|fore, I would advi&s;e the young and unexpe|rienced brother, that he be very circum&s;pect; for "by the fruit the tree is known."&mdash;The er|rors you may accidentally fall into by an involun|tary mi&s;take, recti&s;y them with that prudence becoming a Ma&s;on. Would you wi&s;h to be e&s;|teemed by the good and worthy, be prudent in your words and actions, let it ever be your ulti|mate view, to add re&s;pect to the venerable and noble order, of which you have the honour of being a Member; which will not only di&s;arm malevolence of its &s;ting, but gain you that love and re&s;pect which is due to merit.</P>

<HEAD>PRUDENTIALS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. In all your actions whether public or pri|vate, be prudent as becometh a Ma&s;on; con|&s;ider in your public character, that the eye of the world is upon you, and the partial tongue of the envious is liable to cen&s;ure the mo&s;t vir|tuous endeavours; much more &s;o, &s;hould you, as a Ma&s;on, forget your duty, and give any plau|&s;able rea&s;on, by being guilty of the lea&s;t irregu|lar &s;tep in your conduct.</P>
<P N="2">2d. In your more private connections, <HI>re|member</HI> your thoughts are expo&s;ed to the all|&s;eeing eye of the great Architect of the Univer&s;e; therefore, prudently con&s;ider, that great and comprehen&s;ive Ma&s;onic command, laid down in our &s;piritual Tre&s;&s;el-Board,
<Q><L><HI>"As ye would that men &s;hould do unto you,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Do ye even &s;o to them."</HI></L></Q></P>
<P N="3">3d. It is indi&s;pen&s;ably your duty to check every appearance of vice; for where its baneful influence takes impre&s;&s;ion on human nature, its effects are terrible. It draws a gloom over every &s;hining virtue, prevents its growth, and &s;teals into the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the heart, and infects every thing within its reach; and produces pride, malice, revenge, di&s;cord, &amp;c. &amp;c. Such e|pidemic di&s;orders are diametically oppo&s;ite to our noble in&s;titution, and mu&s;t be guarded again&s;t in particular; they mu&s;t have no place of re&s;i|dence&mdash;no, not even a name in the brea&s;t, e&s;|pecially when made the repo&s;itory of our grand My&s;tery.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Prudence ob&s;erves, that a man given to intemperance is no way fitting for a member of
<PB N="7" REF="023996_0006_0FC2F034F7A9E0C0">any laudable &s;ociety; for he values neither health, wealth, friends, family, reputation or character: But temperance is one of the prin|cipal ornaments of our venerable in&s;titution.&mdash; Therefore, as you prize your character as a Ma|&s;on, be temperate in all things.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Prudence informs us, that Charity, or univer&s;al love, is a peculiar virtue, and grows on|ly in the brea&s;t of the benevolent, and is the grand corner &s;tone of our order. It unites us in one univer&s;al band of affection&mdash;conciliates true friend&s;hip, and effectuates the great and noble purpo&s;e of making each other happy, and re|joicing in each others felicity.</P>
<P N="6">6th. Would you wi&s;h to gain e&s;teem and re|&s;pect be temperate, be frugal, generous, bene|volent, humane, &s;incere and kind to all men; this is indi&s;pen&s;ably your duty, would you wi&s;h to &s;upport the character of a Free Ma&s;on. Pru|dence &s;ays, the prevalency of good example is great; and no language &s;o expre&s;&s;ive as a con|&s;i&s;tent life and conver&s;ation; the&s;e once forfeit|ed in a ma&s;onic character, will dimini&s;h the man in the eye of the worthy, and give a full &s;cope to the envious part of mankind to cen&s;ure our noble and honorable in&s;titution.</P>
<P N="7">7th. True brotherly love is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;a|ry to attain to any degree of perfection in the Ma|&s;onic Art (as it is the life and e&s;&s;ence of all other virtues) your cultivating it, and &s;howing its in|fluence in your life and actions, will te&s;tify to the world, the goodne&s;s of your re&s;pectable or|der, and the tongue of the envious and malevo|lent will be &s;truck dumb, and &s;lander di&s;armed of its venemous &s;ting. Cultivating brotherly love
<PB N="8" REF="023996_0007_0FC2F0367B8AEB80">with laudable emulation, endeavouring to ex|cel each other in whatever in good and prai&s;e|worthy, is what is required of all Free Ma&s;ons. Be not contented, therefore, with the bare name of a Ma&s;on, but walk worthy of that glorious Profe&s;&s;ion, in con&s;tant conformity to its dic|tates; for he who &s;tiles him&s;elf a Ma&s;on, and acts contrary to the mild and &s;alutary precepts of our venerable order, is not worthy of being a Member of the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="8">8th. Prudence &s;ays, Evil-&s;peaking is a mirror, which &s;hews a bad man's principle in fair co|lours. As a Ma&s;on in particular, &s;hun this per|nicious practice of back-biting and &s;peaking evil of any man. How ea&s;y is it to &s;peak well of any man, if you know it to be &s;o; if you do not, &s;ay no ill of him. Be prudent, remem|ber the royal P&s;almi&s;t (he &s;ays) <HI>"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep thou the door of my lips;"</HI> this dete&s;table vice is the offspring of a diabolical, depraved di&s;po&s;ition. A &s;landerous tongue bites like a &s;erpent, and cuts like a &s;word. Con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, brethren, &s;hould any of us be guilty of cen&s;ure, or &s;lander (which I hope not) how incon&s;i&s;tent &s;uch ba&s;e proceedings are with the my&s;tical precepts of our in&s;titution. Dare any of us as Ma&s;ons, pre&s;ume, by one per|nicious bla&s;t of our tongue, at once to ruin our brother or friend's character and reputation, per|haps to all po&s;terity. Lay your hand on your heart, appeal to that, con&s;ider how incompati|ble with the precepts that were delivered to you as a Ma&s;on, to be guilty of &s;uch an injury, then &s;hudder at the thought of &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s, that is &s;o de&s;pi&s;able in the eye of man, and &s;o
<PB N="9" REF="023996_0008_0FC2F03847EC9C38">contrary to the commands of the great Architect of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P N="9">9th. Prudence advi&s;es you, as a man in all your actions and dealing with the world, whe|ther of a public or a private nature, to <HI>"act on the &s;quare"</HI> with all mankind, rendering every man his due. As a Ma&s;on, this duty is doubly encrea&s;ed; prudently con&s;ider, how great the violation, &s;hould you &s;toop &s;o low as to forget every &s;acred tie of Ma&s;onry, and wrong your friend and brother, what would be the con&s;e|quence? You would expo&s;e your&s;elf to the tongue of the &s;landerer, and be de&s;pi&s;ed by all men, and what is wor&s;e, forever forfeit the love and re&s;pect of every worthy Ma&s;on and friend;&mdash;therefore let me conjure you, by that &s;incere ma&s;onic love, that I bear to your per&s;on and character as a friend and brother, that you forget not the &s;acred band of union, that ce|ments and binds us in love and amity together&mdash;that you keep in view that grand period of your life, when by the authority of our Order, you became the fellow, friend and brother of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of men, throughout the globe. And as long as you act con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;alu|tary rules of Ma&s;onry, you will be e&s;teemed and beloved, reverenced and re&s;pected,, by every virtuous and worthy man.</P>
<P>Permit me here to add a charge, which, or &s;omething &s;imilar, you no doubt remember to have been given to you on a &s;olemn occa&s;ion&mdash;and let me recommend a &s;erious attention to the u&s;eful Monitions contained in it.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHARGE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are now admitted, by the unanimous con&s;ent of our Lodge, a fellow of our mo&s;t an|tient and honorable &s;ociety; antient, as having &s;ub&s;i&s;ted from time immemorial, and honorable, as tending in every particular to make the man &s;o, that will be but conformable to its glorious pre|cepts. The greate&s;t monarchs in all ages, as well of A&s;ia and Africa as of Europe, have been en|couragers of the royal Art, and many of them have pre&s;ided as Grand Ma&s;ters over the Ma&s;ons in their re&s;pective dominions; not thinking it any diminution of their imperial dignities to <HI>level</HI> them&s;elves with their Brethren in Ma&s;onry, and to act as they did. The world's Great Architect is our Supreme Ma&s;ter, and the unerring rule he has given us is that by which we work. Religious di&s;putes are never &s;uffered in the Lodge, for, <HI>as Free-Ma&s;ons,</HI> we only pur&s;ue the univer&s;al religion of nature. This is the cement which joins men of the mo&s;t dif|ferent principles in one &s;acred band, and brings together tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t di&s;tant from one another.</P>
<P>THERE are three general heads of duty, which Ma&s;ons ought always to inculcate, viz. to God, our neighbours, and our&s;elves. To God, in never mentioning his name but with that re|verential awe which becomes a creature to bear to his Creator; and to look upon him always as the <HI>&s;ummum bonum</HI> which we came into the world to enjoy: And according to that view to
<PB N="11" REF="023996_0010_0FC2F045BB8D6450">regulate our pur&s;uits. To our neighbours, in <HI>"acting upon the &s;quare,"</HI> or doing as we would be done by. To our&s;elves, in avoiding all intem|perance and exce&s;&s;es, whereby we may be led into a behaviour unbecoming our laudable pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN the &s;tate, a Ma&s;on is to act as a peaceable and dutiful &s;ubject, conforming cheerfully to the government under which he lives; he is to pay a due deference to his &s;uperiors, and from his inferiors he is rather to receive honour with &s;ome reluctance than to extort it; he is to be a man of benevolence and charity, not &s;itting down contented while his fellow-creatures (but much more his Brethren) are in want, and it is in his power, without prejudicing him&s;elf or family, to relieve them. In the Lodge he is to behave with due decorum, le&s;t the beauty and harmony thereof &s;hould be di&s;turbed and broke. He is to be obedient to the Ma&s;ter and pre&s;iding officers, and to apply him&s;elf clo&s;ely to the bu&s;ine&s;s of Ma&s;onry, that he may &s;ooner become a profi|cient therein, both for his own credit, and for that of the Lodge. He is not to neglect his ne|ce&s;&s;ary avocations for the &s;ake of Ma&s;onry, nor to involve him&s;elf in quarrels with tho&s;e who, through ignorance, may &s;peak evil of, or ridicule it. He is to be a lover of the arts and &s;ciences, and to take all opportunities of improving him|&s;elf therein. If he recommends a friend to be made a Ma&s;on, he mu&s;t vouch him to be &s;uch as he really believes will conform to the afore&s;aid duties; le&s;t by his mi&s;conduct at any time the Lodge &s;hould pa&s;s under &s;ome evil imputations. Nothing can prove more &s;hocking to all faithful
<PB N="12" REF="023996_0011_0FC2F046F7313238">Ma&s;ons, than to &s;ee any of their Brethren pro|fane, or break through the &s;acred rules of their Order, and &s;uch as can do it, they wi&s;h had ne|ver been admitted.</P>
<P>WHEN a&s;&s;embled within the peaceful walls of our Lodge, where univer&s;al love and har|mony in&s;pires each bo&s;om. When our bu&s;ine&s;s is over, then prudence introduces gaiety and good humour, to cheer the mind, and diffu&s;e its plea&s;|ing joys over the under&s;tanding; then &s;weet hilarity &s;miles &s;erene on every countenance, and calls for the cheerful Song.</P>
<P>IN the following Pages the worthy Brother will find a &s;mall Collection; which I have &s;elected from different Authors, and which I hope will be well received, and tend to promote harmony and unanimity.</P>
