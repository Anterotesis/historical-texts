<P>PROTESTANTS in general, profe&s;s that the Scriptures are the only perfect Rule to decide all Controver&s;ies; and yet we often find,
<PB N="23" REF="009330_0022_1030EDD8A416F3E0">
that when any Principle or old Cu&s;tom is brought into Di&s;pute, Recour&s;e is pre|&s;ently had to the old Fathers, and if a Number of good Men on one Side, and bad ones on the other can be reckoned up&punc; the Scale is pre&s;ently turned, and the Point decided. Indeed, I am far from &s;lighting pious Predece&s;&s;ors, but would follow them as far as they did <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> yet to make u&s;e of them as Authorities &s;ufficient to &s;hut off any clear Light from the divine Oracles, which they did not &s;ee, is really to injure their Characters, as well as our own Souls.</P>
<P>AGAIN, 'tis generally held that all Saints are imperfect in this Life; and yet, if a Per&s;on who has profe&s;t to have the In-dwelling of the Holy Spirit, happens to have his Judgment altered afterwards in any Point in Religion, I have heard that Promi&s;e, <HI>The Spirit of Truth will guide you into all Truth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xvi. 13.</NOTE>, improved as an Evidence that either they had not the Spirit then, or el&s;e were in an Error now; which is as much as to &s;ay, that when a Per&s;on is under the Operation of the Divine Spirit, his Judgment is then perfect; yea, and that he mu&s;t never have any more Reformation in Principles. All that the Spirit teaches, is Truth; but he does not teach us all Truth at once; for the Ju&s;t walk in that Path that <HI>&s;hines more and more unto the perfect Day</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> iv. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HOW often have we &s;een Per&s;ons that would cry out at others a&s;&s;uming GOD'S Prerogative in &s;earching the Heart, when perhaps they had
<PB N="24" REF="009330_0023_1030EDDBCCDE7EA0">
no better Ground for their Charge, than only the Per&s;on's dealing plainly with others for Evil that they di&s;covered; and yet they very &s;oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would not &s;tick to declare that tho&s;e which they complained of were deluded by the Devil!</P>
<P>PRIDE is generally condemned in Word, and if any who were not introduced into the Mini|&s;try in the common Way of the Land, attempt to preach the Go&s;pel, many are ready to &s;ay to them as <HI>Elieb</HI> did to <HI>David, I know thy Pride, and the Naughtine&s;s of thine Heart</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xvii. 28.</NOTE>; but they don't &s;eem to &s;u&s;pect that Pride moves them to claim the Prerogative of introducing whom they think proper, and of forbiding all that follow not them, though it was that Principle which made <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Di&s;ciples attempt &s;uch a Practice formerly<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mar.</HI> ix. 33&punc; <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. Nay, according to the Behaviour of many in the&s;e Things, it looks as though they thought that Youths being pampered up at <HI>Col|lege,</HI> and then being &s;et over large Congregati|ons, and to live in a great Deal of worldly Gran|deur, &s;ecured them from being <HI>lifted up with Pride;</HI> and then falling <HI>into the Condemnation of the Devil,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 6.</NOTE> more than other Men. The ancient Exhortation to every Man, was <HI>Not to think of him&s;elf more highly than he ought to think; but to think &s;oberly, according as</HI> GOD <HI>hath dealt to every Man the Mea&s;ure of Faith</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 3.</NOTE>. But now let a Man have never &s;o much Knowledge of the Doctrines of Faith, or Experience of the Grace of Faith, and preach never &s;o clearly; yea,
<PB N="25" REF="009330_0024_1030EDDD5D6E87D8">
and with never &s;o much Succe&s;s too; yet if he is not introduced in the Way mentioned above, how many are there that think they have &s;uffi|cient Warrant to reject him?</P>
<P>WHILE I am writing of the&s;e Things, I can (as it were) hear &s;ome &s;ay, "Take Care, you will bring the Mini&s;try into Contempt?" I an&s;wer no, I would fain &s;ecure them from it, by labouring for a Reformation; for I believe each one will find that Saying true, &s;ooner or later, <HI>Who&s;oever ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lteth him&s;elf &s;hall be aba&s;ed; and he that humbleth him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> xiv. 11.</NOTE>. And GOD'S Dealings towards his People in <HI>New-England</HI> for twenty Years back, have been won|derfully calculated, like his Di&s;pen&s;ations to|wards <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s, <HI>To humble them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o prove them, to know what was in their Heart, whether they would keep his Commandments or no</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> viii <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEREFORE to proceed,</P>
<P>HOW many have there been among us, who have profe&s;t to have &s;uch Love to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Cau&s;e, that they would die for him, rather than deny him; who yet have acted quite other|wi&s;e when Trials came on? But there is no End to enumerate Particulars, no Sect, nor Order of Men, are free of this dreadful Evil, of &s;ay|ing one Thing and doing another; though &s;ome are much more guilty of it than others: And the Con&s;ideration hereof, is enough to <HI>aba&s;e</HI> all Fle&s;h before GOD. And before I leave
<PB N="26" REF="009330_0025_1030EDDEF0903870">
this Head, let me ob&s;erve, that there is one Sort of People who &s;trangely think them&s;elves free of this Charge, of &s;aying one Thing and prac|ti&s;ing another, becau&s;e they don't profe&s;s Reli|gion at all. They will exclaim at a high Rate again&s;t the Hypocri&s;y of Profe&s;&s;ors, and declare that they would not be guilty of mocking GOD as they do, upon no Account. Now here &s;eems to be an Acknowledgment of the Divine Om|ni&s;cience, and a Regard to Uprightne&s;s before him; and yet, at the &s;ame Time, they don't &s;o much as pretend to regard his Authority, nor &s;ubmit to his Government. Thus a pro|fe&s;&s;ed Regard to GOD, makes them di&s;regard him; and while they explode Deceit and Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;adly di&s;cover Marks of both: For while the <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> tells of his Fa&s;tings and Performances, the&s;e boa&s;t of their hone&s;t Hearts, and I believe many of them depend as much upon their <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> as others do upon their <HI>Duties.</HI> But are they really hone&s;t? They &s;ay they abhor Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and it &s;eems that they would not pretend to pray to GOD, becau&s;e their Prayers would not be acceptable; that is, they will not come to him, becau&s;e they find no Good in them&s;elves to bring. What amazing Things are here! Here are Men that would not mock GOD, and yet live in open Contempt of his Service; they &s;ay they have hone&s;t Hearts, but will not &s;o much as confe&s;s their Iniquities to him, whom they have provoked, nor &s;eek his Mercy. O Heaven-daring Madne&s;s!</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="009330_0026_1030EDE241656FE8">THUS it appears, that Men are &s;o far from avoiding Incon&s;i&s;tences, by di&s;regarding Re|ligion, that they involve them&s;elves the deeper in Confu&s;ion and Guilt, and run in the high Road to eternal Ruin; while Profe&s;&s;ors are far from being excu&s;able, in not practi&s;ing agree|able to their Profe&s;&s;ion. But one Way of Peace and Happine&s;s therefore remains, which is to fly to the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to <HI>purge our Con&s;ciences from dead Works,</HI> that we may <HI>&s;erve the living God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> ix. 14.</NOTE>; and &s;o to abide in him as the Branch does in the Vine, that we may bring forth much Fruit<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, I would &s;et down a few Words of Advice, to my own Soul as well as others, which if rightly regarded, will afford much Help again&s;t the Evils mainly &s;poken of in this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. LET us meditate much upon the Per|fections of GOD, e&s;pecially his Omni&s;cience and Omnipre&s;ence; that he fills all Places, and &s;ees all Things. A realizing View hereof, will won|derfully guard the Soul again&s;t all Deceit, as well as other Vices. When <HI>David</HI> had been devoutly contemplating upon the&s;e Things, it led him to renounce the Ways of wicked Men, and to cry to GOD to <HI>&s;earch</HI> his Heart and Thoughts, and &s;ee if there was any Way of Wickedne&s;s in him, <HI>and lead him in the Way everla&s;ting</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;a.</HI> cxxxix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="28" REF="009330_0027_1030EDE9448D15B8">2d. LET us often review our Ways, and compare our Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice together; and endeavour to &s;et our&s;elves as Spectators, critically to ob&s;erve how our Conduct may ap|pear to others. But becau&s;e Self is &s;o apt to blind us; therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3d. LET us prize and improve the faithful Reproofs of our Fellow-Chri&s;tians. When the Man after GOD'S own Heart, had been crying to the Lord, that his Lips and Heart might be kept from wicked Works, as believing Prayer engages the Soul to wait for an An&s;wer, in the Way of u&s;ing the be&s;t Means to obtain the Thing reque&s;ted; &s;o he names this as a great Help in the Ca&s;e, <HI>viz. Let the Righteous &s;mite me, it &s;hall be a Kindne&s;s; and let him reprove me, it &s;hall be an excellent Oil which &s;hall not break my Head</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> cxli. 3, -5.</NOTE>. <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, that <HI>open Rebuke is bet|ter than &s;ecret Love;</HI> while he that hates Reproof is <HI>bruti&s;h,</HI> and <HI>&s;hall die</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> xxvii. 5; and xii. 1; and xv. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole, &s;ince the <HI>Jews</HI> tru&s;ted upon their outward Privileges, and re&s;ted in their out|ward Forms, and thought, becau&s;e of them, that their Ca&s;e was &s;afe, though their Hearts and Lives were contrary thereto; but were &s;o far mi&s;taken, that for the&s;e Things, and their rejecting the Saviour, they brought upon them|&s;elves and Po&s;terity, &s;uch Woes as never befel any other People: May our Souls take effectual

Warning, not to re&s;t in any Thing &s;hort of a Union with, and Conformity to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>AND by all Means let us take Heed, that we do not treat this heavenly Friend as the <HI>Jews</HI> did heretofore. His coming is always contrary to Nature: The Prophet puts the Que&s;tion in old Time thus, <HI>Who may abide the Day of his coming? and who &s;hall &s;tand when he appeareth? for he is like a Refiner's Fire, and like Fullers Soap</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mal.</HI> iii. 2.</NOTE>. But &s;hall we regard our Dro&s;s and Filth, more than his Pre&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ings? No, but may all &s;et open Doors that the KING OF GLORY may come in. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
