<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>PREFACES, at this pre&s;ent day, become &s;uch impertinent things, that it is almo&s;t im|proper to offer one without an apology.</P>
<P>The many different reports, which have prevailed in America, &s;ince the ce&s;&s;ion af the Flori|das, concerning their &s;tate, &s;ituation and &s;oil, joined to the natural de&s;ire of tho&s;e concerned, to &s;ee a good ac|count of tho&s;e &s;o celebrated countries, i hope will be apology enough in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of being, from experience, &s;ufficiently en|abled to give a ju&s;t account of them, i have under|taken the following &s;ketch, or out-lines of a future natural hi&s;tory of tho&s;e countries, in hopes that &s;ome abler hand may be thereby induced to take up the pen, and furni&s;h the world with a complete work of that kind for the&s;e provinces; being well a&s;&s;ured, that no part of Briti&s;h America will furni&s;h the naturali&s;t with more variety.</P>
<P>I offer this humble attempt without any recom|mendations, or prai&s;es, of my own; only i beg to a&s;|&s;ure my reader, that i have, through the whole, ad|hered &s;o &s;trictly to truth, as to make no one devia|tion therefrom willingly, or knowingly; guarding on the one hand again&s;t the mi&s;repre&s;entations, where|with the authors of the numerous and noted puffs, concerning the&s;e provinces, have &s;o plentifully inter|larded
<PB N="4" REF="014440_0006_0F92654B4A69DCF0">
their labours; and on the other, again&s;t the prejudices of tho&s;e, who have taken &s;o much pains to render this country unde&s;ervedly de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>No elegance of &s;tyle, nor flowers of rhetoric, mu&s;t be expected from a per&s;on, who is con&s;cious that he is not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the language, to write in &s;uch a manner as will plea&s;e a <HI>critical</HI> reader, and if he has wrote &s;o as to be intelligible, he hopes the candid will excu&s;e &s;uch inaccuracies in compo&s;ition as it is difficult for a foreigner to avoid.</P>

<P>A DESCRIBER of countries, ought in a great mea&s;ure, to imitate a building Engineer, in fir&s;t laying before tho&s;e, whom he will employ, accurate and di|&s;tinct plans of his intended work, thereby enabling them to judge more di&s;tinctly of the execution thereof. I think that in a work of this nature, i could not do this better that by directing my readers to the charts or plans accompanying it, in which they will undoubtedly find materials to form ju&s;t ideas of the places herein de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>To reduce my work to &s;ome regularity, i &s;hall proceed from the Ea&s;t, We&s;tward, and begin with the Penin&s;ula, dividing it into two parts, which i will call climates, the one beginning at Amelia or St. Mary's inlet, in latitude 31: and extending Southward to the latitude of 27:40: this will in|clude the rivers St. Mary, Na&s;&s;au, St. John's or Ylacco, and the Mu&s;keto Lagoon (for &s;urely no one can call this la&s;t a river) be&s;ides &s;everal &s;mal|ler ones, which will be mentioned in their places;

<P>A very dry hot air, though le&s;s dangerous to the body, than a hot moi&s;t one, has yet very near|ly the &s;ame effects, as it partially dries the Ponds, Mar&s;hes, Swamps, &amp;c. leaving the re|maining water and mud to exhale, and &s;pread their noxious vapours through the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Every inhabitant of any part of America knows, that the &s;udden tran&s;itions from cold to heat &s;o prevalent on that continent, are much more to be dreaded, than any of the above named cau&s;es of immoderate heat, cold, moi&s;ture, and drought.</P>
<P>I am now to con&s;ider the nature and appearance of the earth, which in this part of America, may be divided into &s;ix different &s;orts, much the &s;ame as in Carolina, with this di&s;tinction, that it is much more unequally divided.</P>

<P>The &s;avannah's are in this country of two very different kinds, the one is to be found in the pine lands; and notwith&s;tanding the black appearance of the &s;oil, they are as much a white &s;and as the higher lands round them; true it is that clay is very often much nearer to their &s;urface, than in the higher pine lands; they are a kind of &s;inks or drains to tho&s;e higher lands, and their low &s;itua|tion only prevents the growth of pines in them. In wet weather the roads leading through them are almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able. On account of their pro|ducing &s;ome &s;pecies of gra&s;s of a better kind than the wire gra&s;s, they are very often &s;tiled meadows, and i believe, if they could be improved by drain|ing them, without taking away all their moi&s;ture, very u&s;eful gra&s;s might be rai&s;ed in them; but on draining them completely, they prove to be as arrant a &s;and as any in this country. The&s;e &s;a|vannahs often have &s;pots in them more low than common, and filled with water; they are over grown with different &s;pecies of the <HI>crataegus,</HI> or hawthorn, as al&s;o very often a &s;pecies of &s;hrub

<P>The back or inland &s;wamps an&s;wer in &s;ituation to what are called the meadows or &s;avannahs (among the pine lands) their &s;oil being rich, oc|ca&s;ions them to bear trees. The true back &s;wamps, that are in wet &s;ea&s;ons full of &s;tanding water, bear &s;carcely any other tree, than a variety of that &s;pe|cies of Ny&s;&s;a di&s;tingui&s;hed by Botani&s;ts by the name of <HI>Ny&s;&s;a foliis latis acuminatis non dentatis fruc|tu aeleagni minore, pedunculis multiflore,</HI> vulgarly called bottle ar&s;ed tupelo; the continuance of wa|ter on this kind of ground, is the rea&s;on why &s;carce any undergrowth is found here. There are &s;wamps al&s;o called back &s;wamps, but they are either at the head of &s;ome &s;tream, or have more or le&s;s wa|ter running through them; the&s;e are generally ea&s;y to drain. I would have confined my de&s;cription of back &s;wamps to the fir&s;t or &s;tanding ones, and rank|ed the la&s;t (which i think might properly be done) among the river &s;wamps, but i was apprehen&s;ive, that it might have di&s;plea&s;ed &s;ome per&s;on, who entertains the more e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion; the&s;e la&s;t de&s;cribed often are found meer cypre&s;s &s;wamps, in that ca&s;e, they are almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able, by rea&s;on

of the cypre&s;s &s;purs, even when dry, and for hor&s;es, they are extremely dangerous, as they of|ten get &s;taked on tho&s;e &s;purs. This vegetable mon&s;ter i &s;hall hereafter de&s;cribe; i do not remem|ber to have ever &s;een it mentioned any where; when this kind of &s;wamp is not over grown with cypre&s;s alone, its product is the &s;ame as that of the river &s;wamps above mentioned, and in that ca&s;e the &s;oil is certainly good; the&s;e la&s;t when pro|perly drained, are the be&s;t land for the cultivation of hemp.</P>
<P>The mar&s;hes are next to be con&s;idered, they are of four kinds, two in the &s;alt, and two in the fre&s;h water; they are either &s;oft or hard, the &s;oft mar&s;hes con&s;i&s;ting of a very wet clay or mud, are as yet of no u&s;e, without a very great expence to drain them; the hard ones are made up of a kind of marly clay, which in dry &s;ea&s;ons is almo&s;t burned up, true it is they afford a pa&s;ture &s;uffici|ent to keep any gramenivorous animals in good order; but the milk and fle&s;h of them in &s;ea&s;ons, when the cattle near the &s;ea &s;ide cannot find any other food, and con&s;equently feed on this alone, are of &s;o horrible a ta&s;te, that no &s;tranger to the country can make u&s;e of them. Hard mar&s;hes in general are &s;uch, who&s;e &s;oil has too much &s;olidity, for the water to di&s;unite its particles by penetrating them; the &s;oft mar&s;hes are tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;pungy nature allows the water ea&s;ily to penetrate them; i have &s;een of both kinds on Turtle River, about twenty miles up, in which, at about eight or ten feet be|low the &s;urface, there are numbers of cypre&s;s and other &s;tumps remaining, but chiefly cypre&s;s, and many of the fallen trees cro&s;&s;ing each other; this is only to be &s;een at low water, and to the height

<P>This kind of land produces rice very willingly, but if &s;ufficiently made dry, always proves the be&s;t for corn, indigo and hemp; i have &s;een at Mr. Brewington's plantation, about three miles below &s;avannah in Georgia, very good corn and rice to|gether, with the two kinds of melons, and cu|cumbers in great perfection on this &s;pecies of &s;oil.</P>

I have no &s;ufficient ground to decide upon another circum&s;tance, which i am told, viz: That when rice is overflown with this river water, it kills it; above the&s;e &s;prings the water of the river is good: This river is from one and a half to three miles wide, except at the hou&s;e of Mr. Rolle, who has here made an odd attempt towards &s;ettling and making an e&s;tate in as complete a &s;andy de&s;art as can be found; ju&s;t above this, it is full of i&s;lands, exhibiting every where a very romantic appearance; there is a fine piece of water, called Dun's Lake, this is about nine miles from the ri|ver, ea&s;tward from this place, this empties it&s;elf by a &s;tream into the river; another called the Doctor's Lake, is on the we&s;t &s;ide, about &s;ixty miles from the mouth, we &s;ee a variety of aquatic plants floating thereon.

<P>Before i leave St. John's River, i mu&s;t not for|get the river running from &s;outh to north, called Pablo: This originates at a &s;mall di&s;tance from St. Marks or North River, and empties into St. Johns at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the mouth. The water of this river is good, &s;o is the land on it; and it is thought that a communication with St. Mark's or the North River might be effected without much difficulty: this would open an inland navi|gation by canoes or boats, all the way from Ca|rolina to near the Mu&s;keto.</P>
<P>The river St. Mary although it is &s;aid to origi|nate in the <HI>Aehanphanaekin</HI> &s;wamp has a current of fine clear and whole&s;ome water &s;upplied from the pine lands through which it flows, with many fine &s;prings, runs, and rivulets of very clear water, Na&s;&s;au has al&s;o the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings, but doth not &s;pring far di&s;tant from the &s;ea. On Amelia I&s;land near the &s;ea, is a very good &s;pring, which makes a fine &s;tream for &s;ome miles, dividing the i&s;land al|mo&s;t

On the beach betwen St. John's and St. Augu&s;tine, at or near a place called the Hor&s;eguards, there are three good &s;prings running into the &s;ea, and in every part where the beach is clear &s;and, water is obtained by digging. About four miles north of St. Augu&s;tine ri&s;es St. Seba&s;tian's Creek, being a good fre&s;h &s;pring, it &s;oon joins a creek in &s;alt mar&s;hes, and at a &s;mall di&s;tance from town it becomes very large and deep; it empties into St. Ana&s;ta&s;ia's Sound two miles &s;outh of St. Augu&s;tine, making a Penin&s;ula of this territory nearly in form of a cre&s;cent; three miles farther &s;outh is the mouth of the river St. Nicholas not very con&s;iderable; St. Cecilia in the &s;ame &s;ound, the North we&s;t, &s;outh of the Matanca and Penon; the Tomoke and Spruce Creek in the Mu&s;keto Lagoon, and in &s;hort every river and creek in the country except tho&s;e above named, are excellent whole&s;ome water; thus much i &s;up|po&s;e will &s;uffice as to the nature and quality of the water. All the rivers and &s;prings in We&s;t Florida are good.</P>
<P>The aborigines of the country come mo&s;t natu|rally under our next con&s;ideration, no one is ig|norant, that the epithet of indians is given to tho&s;e people, though no doubt, the French name of &s;avage is a much more proper one, as the man|ners of the red men are in every re&s;pect &s;uch as betray that di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;hew the &s;avage thro' the be&s;t wrought veil of civilization; we might call them Americans, as the inhabitants of the old world are each di&s;tingui&s;hed by a name expre&s;&s;ive of, or relative to the quarters, from which they re&s;pectively originate, but this would be con|founding

<P>But to demon&s;trate more clearly the contra&s;t be|tween a &s;avage and the people of the old conti|nent, i beg leave to ob&s;erve a few things, which have fallen under my in&s;pection and con&s;ideration, which i apprehend will be thought pertinent to this purpo&s;e: A &s;avage comes into this world with all the po&s;&s;ibility of oppo&s;ition to us; his mother on her approaching labour, retires from all company, aid, or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, into &s;ome lone|&s;ome wood, and there without perceptible pain or inconvenience, di&s;burthens her&s;elf, goes into cold water to clean&s;e her&s;elf and her offspring, and re|turns to her daily vocation.</P>
<P>A &s;avage has the mo&s;t determined re&s;olution again&s;t labouring or tilling the ground, the &s;lave his wife mu&s;t do that, and a boy of &s;even or eight years old is a&s;hamed to be &s;een in his mother's company. No greater di&s;tance can be thrown on a man than calling him by the odious epithet of Woman; what other nation do we find &s;o ab|&s;olutely neglecting agriculture? What people are a&s;hamed to be &s;een eating or drinking in company with the fairer &s;ex?</P>
<P>Our women carry their children with their fa|ces towards their own, a &s;he &s;avage puts the back of hers towards her own back. When we make fire, we pile the fuel parrallel to each other; the &s;avage puts his wood in a circular form, lights the central ends, and by the help of one of the &s;ticks, which he &s;hoves always to the center, he keeps it in.</P>
<P>We make war in an open brave way, a &s;avage by hiding him&s;elf &s;urprizes; our pri&s;oners are &s;ure

of life, the pri&s;oner of a &s;avage is &s;ure to die by cruel tortures. When we take a &s;weat, we keep our&s;elves warm with the utmo&s;t care; a &s;avage with his open pores, plunges head long into the almo&s;t frozen river, or into a hole in the ice if quite frozen.</P>
<P>A &s;avage man di&s;charges his urine in a &s;itting po&s;ture, and a &s;avage woman &s;tanding, i need not tell how oppo&s;ite this is to our common prac|tice.</P>
<P>A &s;avage never eats &s;alted meats, nor boils any thing in &s;alted water, though he has &s;alt in abun|dance, but when he has been a long while from &s;alt and then gets it, he will frequently eat a pound of it without any thing el&s;e. A &s;avage ei|ther buries none of his dead, or if he does he puts the body in a &s;itting or &s;tanding po&s;ture; in a word, if they had always &s;tudied to be in contra&s;t with us, they could not be more &s;o, than nature has made them.</P>

Their colour re&s;embles that of cinnamon, with a copperi&s;h ca&s;t; they are born white, but retain that hue a very &s;hort time; their hair is lank, &s;trong, black, and long; they prevent the growth of what little beard nature has given them, by plucking it out by the roots; they never &s;uffer any hair to grow on any part of the body except

They are capable of an attachment, rather than a friend|&s;hip; addicted to lying in a high degree; their &s;eeming candour and &s;implicity is an effect of di&s;|&s;imulation; they know how to &s;ave appearances, and will always find ways to cover their knavi&s;h, thieving tricks; their notions of faith and honour are &s;uch as make them violate their word of pro|mi&s;e, even when they are in treaty, unle&s;s com|pelled to be true by fear or force.

<P>But with all the&s;e bad qualities, they have one virtue, which is ho&s;pitality, and this they carry to exce&s;s; a &s;avage will &s;hare his la&s;t ounce of meat with a vi&s;itant &s;tranger.

Among the nations, which i have frequented, a young &s;tranger (led away by the notion of this traveller's &s;tory) that would attempt, on his fir&s;t acquaintance, to a&s;k a man for his daughter, might pay dear for it. The Chactaws, who have a greater idea of a <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum</HI> than any of their neighbours, are not &s;o ho&s;pitable as they; but although they will on this principle require pay for even the lea&s;t mor&s;el, they &s;et before one, yet the &s;ame idea of proper|ty has taken off much of their &s;avage di&s;po&s;itions in many other ca&s;es.</P>
<P>I cannot think it foreign to my &s;ubject to men|tion, before i proceed to the particular de&s;cripti|on of each nation, &s;omething farther about the origin of the native Americans: Great pains have been taken to prove the&s;e people de&s;cended from the <HI>Phaenicians;</HI> among others i find an ano|nimous Gentleman, who gravely tells us, that <HI>Phaenicians</HI> or <HI>Erythreans</HI> in Greek, carry the &s;ame

<P>Ju&s;t &s;o is it with that pretended migration to <HI>A&s;&s;areth,</HI> as mentioned in the fourth book of <HI>E&s;dras,</HI> in the thirteenth chapter; but without in&s;i&s;ting on the apocryphal quality of this evi|dence, i would only a&s;k, why this <HI>A&s;&s;areth</HI> &s;hould be more America, than any other far di&s;tant country? And how they found their way by the <HI>Euphrates</HI> to this continent? Further it is evi|dent, that <HI>St. Jerome</HI> (who flouri&s;hed under <HI>The|odo&s;ius</HI> in the latter end of the fourth century, lived in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and held a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with the Jews, for the &s;ake of learning their lan|guage) plainly tells us in his <HI>Ezech:</HI> L. 5, and <HI>Jerem:</HI> L. 6, that tho&s;e very ten tribes, were then groaning under the &s;evere yoke of &s;lavery, in the

<P>Yet, as a farther proof of the fal&s;hood of this American expedition, by the ten tribes of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> i would beg leave to a&s;k my readers, whether they can imagine, that &s;o prodigious a migration could po&s;&s;ibly happen at a time of the mo&s;t de&s;pe|rate wars, and de&s;olations in the very countries through which they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s, for it is evident, that &s;ince <HI>St. Jerome</HI>'s time, although the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> had again regained their empire, yet for &s;everal centuries together, they were con|&s;tantly warring with the <HI>Romans, Indians,</HI> and other Ea&s;tern nations, and la&s;tly with the <HI>Saracens.</HI> 'Till the famous Tartarian expedition under <HI>Zen|gis Chan,</HI> this whole country &s;wam in the blood of its natives, and before this period, the Greci|an wars, the conque&s;ts of <HI>Alexander,</HI> with the di|vi&s;ions of his captains at his death, furni&s;hed as little opportunity for this journey, which al&s;o mu&s;t have been &s;trangely overlooked, by &s;uch a number of hi&s;torians of credit, as flouri&s;hed dur|ing the above &s;pace of time.

<P>No le&s;s idle is the argument u&s;ed by Grotius concerning the Mexicans telling the Spaniards, that they came out of the North, where he thinks to find the Norwegian de&s;cent in the city <HI>Norum|bega,</HI> but who can find in North America, traces of any ancient city at all? That the Americans divide their time by nights (or &s;leeps, as they &s;tile them) is true, al&s;o their dipping new born infants in cold water, their going naked, and their eating &s;eparate from the women, with many other cu&s;toms of the &s;avages, &s;imilar to the anci|ent manners of the Germans, but this only proves to me, that in the times of <HI>Tacitus</HI> and the other <HI>Roman</HI> hi&s;torians, the <HI>Teutonick</HI> nations were in as &s;avage a &s;tate of nature, as we now &s;ee the Ame|ricans; a &s;amene&s;s in colour, and &s;tature, as well as, or rather than &s;imilarity of Languages is to me a requi&s;ite proof, and for that rea&s;on i believe, that the <HI>E&s;kimaux</HI> came from <HI>Lapland,</HI> but by what accident, we are ignorant of, and &s;o we might gue&s;s at &s;ome eventual pa&s;&s;age of the red &s;avages, were we able to trace any &s;imilarity be|tween them and any nation of the old world, but we &s;ee none; yet all the i&s;lands of America, even <HI>New Zealand,</HI> are peopled by the &s;ame race as this va&s;t continent; therefore i will rather &s;up|po&s;e,
<PB N="49" REF="014440_0064_0F92658AA30ABBD0">
that the &s;avages, have &s;ent out colonies, than that they are a colony from any other part of the earth. The &s;ame Gentleman endeavours to fetch the <HI>Peruvians</HI> from <HI>China,</HI> but with as little foundation in truth. Mr. Powell's &s;tory of Maddock the Wel&s;hman's voyage, cannot be thought fit, to a&s;cribe a Wel&s;h origin to the &s;ava|ges, becau&s;e they could by no means either grow to &s;uch numbers, nor degenerate &s;o much in colour, as they mu&s;t have done, in two centuries; yet even this has been made u&s;e of by a certain Dutch writer, who&s;e name i do not now recollect; and how unluckily does <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> here bring forth the black headed <HI>Pinguin,</HI> to prove that the Wel&s;h word <HI>Pen-gwin,</HI> was given to this bird for a name, by Maddock's followers, becau&s;e <HI>Pen</HI> is head, and <HI>gwyn</HI> is white, and Mr. Fo&s;ter in his note on that pa&s;&s;age, is as unlucky in &s;aying <HI>Penguin</HI> is Spani&s;h for a fat bird.</P>
<P>I find a more powerful argument u&s;ed by tho&s;e who bring the &s;avages from <HI>Tartary;</HI> becau&s;e i do not at all doubt, from my judgment of geography, that <HI>America</HI> joins <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> but the ex|pedition of <HI>Hoccota,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Cangui&s;ta,</HI> fir&s;t King of the Tartars, as mentioned by <HI>Michalon Lituanus,</HI> in his <HI>Ennead</HI> 9, L. 6, which has like|wi&s;e been con&s;trued to have reached America, is al&s;o too late to allow them time to become &s;o nu|merous a people; becau&s;e this man lived about the year 1240; but although i believe a po&s;&s;ibili|ty of the pa&s;&s;age by land, yet i cannot find, that there is any &s;imilarity in the per&s;ons of the North Ea&s;tern Tarters&punc; and the American &s;avages, and much le&s;s in their manners; and if there is be|tween tho&s;e of <HI>Kam&s;chatka</HI> and America, i &s;till

<P>The contemptible light, in which <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> en|deavours to place the number of the &s;avages, is well confuted by Mr. Hutchin's account of the nations near our &s;ettlements, who having mutu|ally de&s;troyed each other, and been de&s;troyed by the &s;word, and liquid fire of the Europeans, at a &s;hocking rate, yet amount by that Gentleman's moderate calculation, even at this day, to near three hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls; therefore it is not their &s;mall number, but the va&s;t extent of this continent, that cau&s;es their nomadic life.</P>
<P>But to treat more particularly again&s;t this no|tion, of the American de&s;cent from the Tartars, who can &s;uppo&s;e that their darling animal, as well for food, labour, and war, as other u&s;es, i mean the hor&s;e, &s;hould not have been brought along with the colony? Who knows not, that the Tartars u&s;e mo&s;t, and can lea&s;t &s;pare this no|ble creature? Does not all their martial power con&s;i&s;t in hor&s;emen? Does not their very main|tenance depend on hor&s;es? Have we not &s;uffici|ent proof, that many Tartarian Lords keep hun|dreds of hor&s;es, and even &s;table them? None are &s;o poor as not to have two or three; when they &s;hift their abode, do not hor&s;es carry

their tents and provi&s;ions? When all other food fails them, garlick and mare's milk is their re|&s;ource; the very blood out of the veins of the&s;e animals &s;upplies the place of an agreeable drink; what &s;tream &s;o rapid which they do not cro&s;s on their hor&s;es backs, or by holding their manes, and guiding them with a twig, while they &s;wim at their &s;ide? making a &s;mall raft of their bag|gage, they tie it to the tail, and thus cro&s;s every river in their way; a hor&s;e's &s;kin makes a boat to cro&s;s a very wide river, lake, or even an arm of the &s;ea; the &s;uppo&s;ed narrow divi&s;ion between A&s;ia and America, near Cape <HI>Tchuk&s;hi,</HI> could then by no means, be an ob&s;tacle to the tran&s;|portation of the&s;e animals the divi&s;ion of the &s;e|veral places, named by <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI> through earth|quakes, is ab&s;urdly introduced, to prove that this migration happened before &s;uch a convul&s;ion of nature, which prevented the return of any of the&s;e emigrants. A Tartarian army ap|pears larger than it is, on account of each man having two or three hor&s;es; and notwith&s;tanding their hor&s;es die by the &s;word, or are killed for food, yet many thou&s;ands are yearly delivered to <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> by the European Tartars only; this much premi&s;ed, how had the &s;avages no hor&s;es on the arrival of the Spaniards? Had the Tartars in|habited a country near America, the very hor&s;es would have increa&s;ed &s;o as to come over to this continent; how many in&s;tances do we find even among the &s;ettled provinces of America, of hor&s;es going wild! but the greate&s;t proof, that this mu&s;t have infallibly happened, is to be found in South America, where now many millions are found wild, in the great plains &s;outh of Brazil,

But as but one nation among &s;o many has accepted this idea, it cannot be allowed, even as the mo&s;t di&s;tant proof; the fable of the <HI>E&s;caaniba</HI> by Bo&s;&s;u al&s;o, is too ridiculous and ab&s;urd to merit confu|tation.</P>

does not know that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> might more ea|&s;ily, have come over to the ea&s;tern &s;hore of Ame|rica, acro&s;s the Atlantic, than over the wilder, wider, and more &s;tormy South Sea, to land on <HI>Perus's</HI> or <HI>Chilis's</HI> unho&s;pitable &s;hore, where our large European ve&s;&s;els can &s;carcely live, much le&s;s a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> junk; nor did the <HI>Peruvians</HI> know any thing of large Ve&s;&s;els till the arrival of the Spaniards; &s;trange indeed, that their naval knowledge, and mother country, &s;hould be thus forgotten! the more &s;o, as it is much ea&s;ier, to go from America to <HI>China,</HI> than the contrary, by rea&s;on of the con&s;tant ea&s;terly winds reigning here, which al&s;o make it more improbable that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> ve&s;&s;els came here by chance, or &s;tre&s;s of weather; nor could they in that ca&s;e, but by chance, be provided with the provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o long a voyage.</P>
<P>Methinks i hear &s;ome critical per&s;on &s;ay, whence then came the &s;avages?

<P>Without doubt <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s account of the Creati|on is true, but why &s;hould this Hi&s;torian's books, in this one thing, be taken &s;o univer&s;ally, when he evidently has confined him&s;elf to a kind of chronicle concerning one &s;mall part of the earth, and in this to one nation only; this account therefore mu&s;t be under&s;tood with the &s;ame limi|tation as many others in holy writ are generally allowed to be; i think therefore that (as menti|oned

Or one tribe with a red, a &s;e|cond with a &s;allow, a third with a yellow, and a fourth with a black colour, &amp;c? Be&s;ides we read of but one cur&s;e of this kind; they are dif|ferent &s;pecies then.

Why then &s;hall we involve our|&s;elves into numberle&s;s, needle&s;s difficulties about the origin of the&s;e &s;o &s;ingular people, &s;o very dif|ferent from all other tribes on the globe, yet &s;o very &s;imilar to each other: Throughout their own continent their wild manners are univer&s;ally

alike; their languages only differ; why then can we not take the more ea&s;y way in &s;aying, God has created an original pair here as well as el&s;e|where: Is not this opinion &s;upported by our finding numberle&s;s other kinds of the animal kingdom on this continent peculiar to it&s;elf; where (be&s;ides in America) do we find the <HI>Bos Americanus?</HI> Where the <HI>Paca,</HI> and <HI>Vecunha</HI> (both American &s;heep?) where the <HI>Ur&s;us Lu&s;cus</HI> or racoon, the <HI>Armadillo,</HI> the <HI>Agouti,</HI> the <HI>Lacerta Americana,</HI> called <HI>Leguana?</HI> the <HI>Ignavo</HI> (an a|nimal called the American Sloth?) where the &s;ame kind of <HI>Simiae,</HI> and the <HI>Ve&s;pertilio Cynoce|phalus?</HI> where the <HI>Warri</HI> or the <HI>Pecaire</HI> (two &s;pecies of the <HI>Sus?</HI>) The many kinds of <HI>Myr|mecophaga,</HI> the <HI>Mus Mar&s;upialis, Mus Scalopes, Mus Palu&s;tris hi&s;pidus,</HI> of the &s;ame kind, as tho&s;e in America?

<P>Again, whence was America &s;tocked with men in our likene&s;s? Where were the oxen, the hor&s;es, the &s;wine, dogs, cats, or even rats? or

where were our poultry to be found on this con|tinent? Yet we &s;ee how immen&s;ely they have multiplied &s;ince their fir&s;t importation, &s;o that the air and food are certainly well adapted to them; a wi&s;e effect of providence, which knew this quarter mu&s;t one day become inhabited by animals not originally created in it.</P>
<P>What can now be &s;aid again&s;t this my argu|ment for a &s;eparate origin of the &s;avages? No|thing that will amount to an ab&s;olute proof of the contrary. But a difficulty ari&s;es as to the ef|fect of the deluge; to remove which i mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that America, even in its mountains, re|tains very few if any of the &s;o often quoted marks of this inundation; on the contrary, it is a &s;mooth regularly ri&s;ing country; and i think, that to believe the flood &s;o far partial, as to have reach|ed the only lands of <HI>Egypt, Pale&s;tine, Armenia,</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> is by no means an ab&s;urd opinion, nor incon&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;truction of the race of men of which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> treats, nor with the water being fifteen cubits above the highe&s;t hill then known, &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Arrarat;</HI> and had it been ab&s;olutely univer&s;al, yet the <HI>Andes, Cordileras, Aceytas,</HI> and <HI>Santa Martha,</HI> are many hundred cubits higher and con&s;equently, might remain a va&s;t way dry; but grant the deluge univer&s;al, who will di&s;pute with me, that the omnipotent Lord of the univer&s;e could create a red man after his own image, &s;uffer him to fall as well as a white man, de&s;troy his po&s;terity except a few, and find a way to &s;ave a remnant of man and bea&s;t, and then for rea&s;ons, into which we have no right to enter, any more than the clay has to contend with the potter, leave this race without

extending his tender mercies to them, as he did to us, not even &s;ending his apo&s;tles into this quarter of the world; and when the chri&s;tians, &s;o called, arrived here fir&s;t, to &s;uffer the pretend|ed Mi&s;&s;ionaries to preach a fal&s;e, ab&s;urd doctrine to tho&s;e wretches, nay, even to this day to harden their hearts again&s;t the light drawn from under a bu&s;hel, and placed con&s;picuou&s;ly on a candle|&s;tick.</P>
<P>However among none of the &s;avages do we find any tradition of &s;uch a flood, except among &s;ome &s;outhern nations, who tell of &s;ix per&s;ons creeping out of a hole, whereby the earth was peopled; the&s;e have been con&s;trued into <HI>Noah</HI>'s &s;ons and their wives.</P>
<P>The Chactaws have told me of a hole between their nation and the Chica&s;aws, out of which their whole very numerous nation walked forth at once, without &s;o much as warning any neigh|bours; i cannot find any relation between this and a deluge: On the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> i have indeed been warned by the &s;avages of an ap|proaching flood on a certain day, and when i had &s;tayed till then and &s;aw the event to be nothing, i ridiculed them about it; and they told me that a great while ago they had &s;uch an inundation, and that their <HI>Sukies</HI> or conjurors, had foretold a &s;imilar one now, but had proved them&s;elves ly|ars; this is the only hint i could ever trace of any notion of a great flood; and i leave my reader to judge of the weakne&s;s or force of this evidence, and of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the opinion advanced, which i offer only becau&s;e i think that truth &s;hould be the object of man's enquiries, and that God has given us the only advantage we

<P>I &s;hall now treat of the four mo&s;t noted nati|ons connected with Florida in particular, begin|ning with the Chica&s;aws, they being (although a &s;mall tribe) accounted the mother nation on this part of the continent, and their language, univer&s;ally adopted by mo&s;t, if not all the we&s;t|ern nations. This is the mo&s;t fierce, cruel, in&s;olent, and haughty people, among the &s;outhern nati|ons; they are very intrepid in the wars with their Meridional neighbours, and the French under Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Artaguette</HI> and <HI>Bienville,</HI> in 1736 expe|rienced their valour (when aided by a few En|gli&s;hmen of tried courage) and in 1752, and 1753, Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Benoi&s;t</HI> and <HI>Reggio</HI> likewi&s;e found them &s;ucce&s;sful to their co&s;t; but with the nor|thern nations it &s;tands otherways; the <HI>Kikapoos, Piancashas</HI> and others are their terror; notwith|&s;tanding their boa&s;t of &s;calps from the northward, it has appeared that, except &s;ome private murders among nations, who think the in&s;ult to come from &s;ome other quarter, and &s;ome &s;laves and &s;calps obtained from the da&s;tardly <HI>Chigtagiks,</HI> they have really not been able &s;o much as to find the <HI>Kika|poos, Piancasha, Wyogtani, Shogteys, Mu&s;quakey, Otogami</HI> towns; this appeared clearly while i was in the Chica&s;aw nation in the winter of 1771 and 1772, when one Mr. James (who had been a pri&s;oner with the <HI>Kikapoos,</HI> for the &s;pace of three years, and had found means to e&s;cape from them) arrived there, and told, that in all that time ne|ver one of the Chica&s;aws appeared, or did mi&s;|chief among the&s;e nations, nor could he learn they ever did; yet it is evident that the&s;e come
<PB N="60" REF="014440_0076_0F9265977A94EAF0">
to the very Chica&s;aw towns to commit depredati|ons, as well as in their hunting grounds, where the Chica&s;aws always take care to fortify them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o ob&s;ervable, that to the north of their towns they never venture any plantations, and to the &s;outhward they have many; nay they &s;carcely venture to get fire wood north of their habitati|on; in &s;hort they have never &s;hewn their brave|ry but again&s;t the Chactaws and Creeks, with the French their allies; the Northerns have al|ways been their ma&s;ters, and the <HI>Arkan&s;as</HI> and <HI>Catawbas</HI> their match; the <HI>Cherokees</HI> have gene|rally had the wor&s;t of the wars between them; they have always been &s;taunch allies to the Eng|li&s;h, but i think there is no very great dependance to be had on them now, for i can (not without rea&s;on) affirm, that that alliance was all owing to the French being their irreconcilable, and mortal enemies; now the&s;e are out of the way, little re|liance is to be had on them; and in the winter of 1771 and 1772, the traders were under daily apprehen&s;ions of a quarrel. It is true that tho&s;e mon&s;ters in human form, the very &s;cum and out ca&s;t of the earth, are always more prone to &s;avage barbarity than the &s;avages them&s;elves; but it is no le&s;s true, that the traders were of as di&s;&s;olute a life, and of as profligate manners, with as great an inclination for deceit and over reaching during the French time, as they are now; but then the policy of the&s;e &s;avages curbed their thoughts of revenge; whereas now they frequently dare to vent threats of a di&s;agreeable nature, which are the more dangerous becau&s;e tho&s;e &s;avage politici|ans are always very much upon their guard when
<PB N="61" REF="014440_0077_0F926597AEF69928">
they are treating with our men in office, how they behave them&s;elves in this re&s;pect, well knowing that the ancient fame of their faithful alliance is &s;ufficiently rooted in the hearts of the open minded Engli&s;h, to enable them to impo&s;e on their credulity.</P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of Chica&s;aw honour or faith, which is indeed equal to that of any nation of American &s;avages whatever; i would mention the tryal that has been made for concluding an union between the <HI>Arkan&s;as, Quappas,</HI> or <HI>Kappas,</HI> and the Chica&s;aws; the fir&s;t attempted at lea&s;t an alliance with the latter &s;o long ago as 1764, but no kind of &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y, or deputation was employed for the effecting this before the &s;ummer 1771, and then at this meeting the in&s;olence of the Chica&s;aws run &s;o high, as to in&s;ult one of the <HI>Quapa</HI> deputies by calling him a woman, and &s;pit|ting rum in his face, which was put up with; but the <HI>Arkan&s;as</HI> never have made an attempt to fini&s;h the treaty &s;ince, and i dare venture to fore|tell, that &s;uch an union would by no means be for our good, let it happen when it may.</P>
<P>The morals of this nation are more corrupt than tho&s;e of any of their neighbours; the Chac|taws are &s;aid to be thieves, but i can a&s;&s;ure the reader that the Chica&s;aws are a thou&s;and times more &s;o; i have had ample proof of it by lo&s;ing incomparably more in one day at the Chica&s;aw town than i did in two months going through &s;e|venty four Chactaw towns, notwith&s;tanding i had been warned, and was on my guard again&s;t the Chica&s;aws; my razors and a ca&s;e of in&s;truments, and other trifles of no real u&s;e to them, be&s;ides every hor&s;e i had with me, vani&s;hed in one day

among the&s;e deceitful people. Their di&s;cour&s;e is really intolerable, nothing but filth is heard from them; the vanity of being accounted great hunters and warriors has the better of every con|&s;ideration, and rather than conde&s;cend to culti|vate the earth (which they think beneath them) they will &s;it and toy with their women; or if they &s;end them to labour, they play on an auk|ward kind of flute made of a cane, lolling thus their time away with great indifference, which obliges them yearly to apply for corn and pul&s;e to the Chactaws.</P>
<P>They live nearly in the center of a very large and &s;omewhat uneven &s;avannah, of a diameter of above three miles; this &s;avannah at all times has but a barren look, the earth is very Nitrous, and the &s;avages get their water out of holes or wells dug near the town; in any drought the ground will gape infi&s;&s;ures of about &s;ix or &s;even inches wide, and again, two or three days rain will cau&s;e an inundation; the water is always ni|trous, and this field abounds, with flint, marl, and tho&s;e kinds of anomilous fo&s;&s;ils mi&s;taken for oy&s;ter &s;hells, which cannot be burnt into lime; yet this produces a gra&s;s of which cattle are &s;o fond as to leave the riche&s;t cane brakes for it; and notwith&s;tanding the &s;oil appears barren and burnt up, they thrive to admiration; it al&s;o af|fords a va&s;t, or even immen&s;e &s;tore of the &s;alu|brious <HI>Fragaria,</HI> vulgarly known by the name of wood &s;trawberry.</P>
<P>They have in this field what might be called one town, or rather an a&s;&s;emblage of hutts, of the length of about one mile and a half, and very narrow and irregular; this however they

<P>The neare&s;t running water, is about one mile and a half off, to the &s;outh of the town, in the edge of the field, but it is of no note; the next is four miles off; and at high times, canoes might come up here out of the river <HI>Tombechb&eacute;;</HI> this place is a ford, which often proves difficult, and on this account is called <HI>Nahoola Inalchubba</HI> (i. e.) the white mens hard labour.</P>
<P>Hor&s;es and cattle thrive well in this nation, their breed of the former was once famous, being de|&s;cended from &s;ome Arabian hor&s;es brought from Spain to Mexico, but of late they have &s;o mixed them with meaner kinds, as to cau&s;e them to de|generate much.</P>
<P>The traders who for fear of cau&s;ing jealou&s;y by their di&s;cour&s;e have formed nick names for all the &s;avage nations, have called the&s;e by the whim&s;ical name of the breed; as cunningly &s;u&s;|picious as the &s;avages are, yet i never found that any of them ever took notice of this di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>One remarkable thing i cannot omit of this na|tion: There were in 1771, only two real origi|nal Chica&s;aws left; one of them, who goes by the name of <HI>North We&s;t,</HI> &s;cruples not to tell them all very often, that they are of a &s;lave race.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="014440_0080_0F92659A012EB430">Their grand Chief is called <HI>Opaya Mataha,</HI> and it is &s;aid he has killed his man upwards of forty times, for which great feats he has been rai&s;ed to this nominal dignity, which by all &s;avages is as much regarded, as among us a titular nobleman would be if he &s;hould be obliged to be a journey|man taylor for his maintenance.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;avages are the only ones i ever heard of who make their females ob&s;erve a &s;eparation at the time of their <HI>Men&s;es</HI> (&s;ome ancient almo&s;t extirpated tribes to the northward only excepted, and the&s;e u&s;ed to avoid their own dwelling hou&s;es) the wo|men then retire into a &s;mall hut &s;et apart for that purpo&s;e, of which there are from two to &s;ix round each habitation, and by them called moon hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The whole tribe are remarkably &s;trong made fellows, but few of their women have regular features, or de&s;erve to be called hand&s;ome; the&s;e labour va&s;tly hard, either in the field for culti|vation of corn, or fetching nuts, fire wood and water, which they chiefly carry on their backs; the two fir&s;t articles generally two or three miles, and the la&s;t often a mile, their burthens would amaze a &s;tranger, being rather fit for a&s;&s;es than women to carry.</P>
<P>This nation is the mo&s;t imperious in their car|riage towards their women, of any i have met with; they are very jealous of their wives, and adultery in them is puni&s;hed by the lo&s;s of the tip of the no&s;e, which they &s;ometimes cut, but more generally bite off, but this does not deter them, for they are a very &s;alacious race, and the mark is pretty general. They are all good &s;wimmers, notwith&s;tanding they live &s;o far from waters, but
<PB N="65" REF="014440_0081_0F92659AFA2C70D8">
they learn their children to &s;wim in clay holes, that are filled in wet &s;ea&s;ons by rain.</P>
<P>They are the mo&s;t expert of any perhaps in America in tracking what they are in pur&s;uit of, and they will follow their flying enemy, on a long gallop, over any kind of ground without mi&s;taking.</P>
<P>Since i am on this &s;ubject, i cannot forbear taking notice of one thing related by many wri|ters on America; which is the knowledge the &s;avages have by the track of what kind of people they pur&s;ue; this is very true, and this &s;agaci|ous particular de&s;erved admiration, but the won|der mu&s;t cea&s;e when i tell my reader, that i have found in it much of a juggle, for in&s;tead of knowing it by the foot &s;teps (which they pretend to mea&s;ure very ceremoniou&s;ly with their hands) they know it by the &s;trokes of the hatchets in the trees and branches as they go along, which no two &s;avage nations agree in, be it in the height from the ground, or in the &s;lope of the cut; they can al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;h the different ways of making camps and fires; for in&s;tance; a Chactaw war camp is circular, with a fire in the center, and each man has a crutched branch at his head to hang his powder and &s;hot upon, and to &s;et his gun again&s;t, and the feet of all to the fire; a Cherokee war camp is a long line of fire, again&s;t which they al&s;o lay their feet; a Chactaw makes his camp in travelling in form of a &s;ugar loaf; a Chica&s;aw makes it in form of our arbours; a Creek like to our &s;heds, or piazzas, to a timber hou&s;e; in this manner every nation has &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;h|ing way.</P>

I cannot forbear to mention a merry accident on this occa&s;ion; a Chactaw In|dian, who was hunting with one of the&s;e decoys on his fi&s;t, &s;aw a deer, and thinking to bring it to him, imitated the deer's motions of feeding and looking round in a very natural way, ano|ther &s;avage within &s;hot, mi&s;taking the head for a real one, &s;hot the ball through it, &s;carcely mi&s;&s;ing

<P>Their habitations at home con&s;i&s;t of three buildings, a &s;ummer hou&s;e, a corn hou&s;e, and a winter hou&s;e, called a hot hou&s;e; the two fir&s;t are oblong &s;quares, the latter is circular, they have no chimnies but let the &s;moke find its way out through a hole at the top in their dwelling hou&s;es, but in the hot hou&s;es, where it can; in the&s;e they make large wood fires, on the middle of the floor, which being by evening all coals, they enter in, and &s;leep on benches made round the in&s;ide of the building; this would &s;tifle any one not u&s;ed to it, and be it never &s;o &s;harp a morning, they come out &s;weating and naked as &s;oon as it is day; i believe this proceeding kills numbers of them, as in lattitude 35 00, where they live, it is often very cold; they al&s;o u&s;e for an univer&s;al cure of all di&s;ea&s;es, exce&s;&s;ive &s;weat|ing in the&s;e hot hou&s;es, and then with their pores open jump into a hole of cold water, this treat|ment of tho&s;e that had the &s;mall pox killed num|bers; the&s;e hot hou&s;es of a morning emitting &s;moke through every crevice, &s;eem to a &s;tranger to be all on fire on the in&s;ide.</P>

and pounding their corn, before it comes to maturity; this they call <HI>Boota Copa&s;&s;a</HI> (i. e.) cold flour; this, in &s;mall quantities, thrown into cold water, boils and &s;wells as much as common meal boiled over a fire; it is hearty food, and being &s;weet, they are fond of it; but as the proce&s;s for making it is trouble&s;ome, their lazine&s;s &s;eldom allows them to have it; they likewi&s;e u&s;e hickory nuts in plenty, and make a milkey liquor of them, which they call milk of nuts; the proce&s;s is at bottom the &s;ame as what we u&s;e to make milk of almonds; this milk they are very fond of, and eat it with &s;weet potatoes in it; they al&s;o make a great u&s;e of Bears fat as oil; the fle&s;h the traders have learned them to make into ba|con, exactly re&s;embling that of a hog; but all the&s;e di&s;hes &s;uit but ill the palate of an European, and when they have any deer or buffalo fle&s;h at home, it is &s;o dried as to have no ta&s;te in it.</P>
<P>The knowledge they have of cattle keeping is borrowed from the traders among them, who, notwith&s;tanding the ordinance again&s;t &s;ettling on Indian grounds, have many of them plantations, and rai&s;e cattle and hogs; one Caldwell has the greate&s;t &s;tock; and <HI>Opaya Mingo Luxi</HI> went in 1771 to complain of it, but Caldwell, knowing that no &s;avage can with&s;tand the words of a white man, took advantage thereof, and &s;o intimidated the &s;avage, by his meer pre&s;ence at Pen&s;acola, when in the &s;uperintendant's hall, in order to lodge his information, and make his complaint that <HI>Opaya Mingo Luxi</HI> him&s;elf &s;aid he had nothing again&s;t him; but as the very Com|mi&s;&s;ary has a plantation and cattle, and keeps negroes &amp;c. for the cultivation thereof (though

<P>This office of Commi&s;&s;ary &s;eems to me the mo&s;t needle&s;s expence the crown is at, as it only &s;erves for a &s;ubject of ridicule both to the traders and &s;avages, which la&s;t &s;cruple not often to give the officer in this nation the (among them) &s;canda|lous epithet of old woman; and he can do but little towards preventing di&s;orders among them, or in regulating the &s;tandard of the trade; be&s;ides, i am &s;ure that whatever Commi&s;&s;iary dared to pretend to be any thing more than a cypher, would run an imminent ri&s;que of his life.</P>

<P>They are horridly given to &s;odomy, commit|ting that crime even on the dead bodies of their enemies, thereby (as they &s;ay) degrading them into women.</P>
<P>In their war parties, they have generally one who has done mo&s;t mi&s;chief to the enemy for their leader; but he is &s;o far from having a com|mand, that an attempt, to do more than pro|po&s;ing whether &s;uch or &s;uch an undertaking would not be mo&s;t advi&s;eable, or at mo&s;t per|&s;uading them to it, would at lea&s;t be followed by a total de&s;ertion.</P>
<P>They are very ceremonious in their preparati|ons for war, and their fondne&s;s for witchcraft makes them look for omens of futurity.</P>
<P>They and all other &s;avages have the greate&s;t &s;hare of patience imaginable; when a &s;calp or pri&s;oner is in que&s;tion, they will travel hundreds of miles in the de&s;arts, with amazing precaution, enduring hunger, and often thir&s;t, at a great rate; nay if their provi&s;ions fail before they &s;trike the blow, they have been known to return to hunt for more in &s;ome &s;afe place, and without going home, to make a &s;econd or third attempt.</P>
<P>They make war by &s;tratagem, &s;urpri&s;e or am|bu&s;h, de&s;pi&s;ing us as fools for expo&s;ing our&s;elves to be &s;hot at like marks. A man's valour with them con&s;i&s;ts in their cunning, and he is deemed the greate&s;t hero who employs mo&s;t art in &s;ur|pri&s;ing his enemy; they never &s;trike a blow un|le&s;s they think them&s;elves &s;ure of a retreat, and the lo&s;s of many men is an infamous crime laid to the charge of the party,</P>

<P>A people who by many peculiar cu&s;toms, are very different from the other red men on the continent, will next amu&s;e us: They are the Chactaws, more commonly known by the name of the Flatheads. The&s;e people are the only na|tion from whom i could learn any idea of a tra|ditional account of a fir&s;t origin; and that is their coming out of a hole in the ground, which they &s;hew between their nation and the Chica|&s;aws; they tell us al&s;o that their neighbours were &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing a people ri&s;e at once out of the earth; dark as this account of a fir&s;t ex|i&s;tence of the&s;e people is to us, we di&s;cover in it a higher idea of an origin than among their neighbours, who never pretend to tell from whence they came, and have only loo&s;e ideas of a migration from the north we&s;t; which prevail among the Chica&s;aws and all other &s;outhern nati|ons.</P>
<P>The Chactaws may more properly be called a nation of farmers than any &s;avages i have met with; they are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable people in Florida, and their &s;ituation may be known by

the annexed plan of their country: Their hunt|ing grounds are in proportion le&s;s con&s;iderable than any of their neighbours; but as they are ve|ry little jealous of their territories, nay with ea&s;e part with them, the Chica&s;aws and they never interrupt each other in their hunting; as i menti|oned before.</P>
<P>They are in their warlike temper far from be|ing &s;uch cowards as people in general will pre|tend, but it is true they are not &s;o fond of wan|dering abroad to do mi&s;chief as the other &s;avages are; few of &s;uch expeditions are undertaken by them, and they g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve for a rea&s;on, that in going abroad they may chance to be obliged to content them&s;elves with a woman's or child's &s;calp, but in &s;taying at home and waiting the attack of the enemy, they by pur&s;uing them, are &s;ure to take men, which is a greater mark of valour: be this as it will, it is certain they are carefully, cun|ningly, and bravely watchfull at home, and on &s;everal occa&s;ions they have, after many in&s;ults, boldly offered to meet their enemies in equal numbers on a plain, which has always been by the other &s;avages treated with &s;corn, as cowar|dice; however when it has happened by chance that they meet &s;o, we have &s;een them brave and victorious. Even in the very town of Mobile, an action of this kind happened de&s;erving a re|cord, when they drove their enemies (the Creeks) through the river, and but for their inability to &s;wim, they would have totally de&s;troyed them; the Captain <HI>Hooma</HI> or red Captain fighting with forty Men again&s;t three hundred Creeks, and with his own hand de&s;troying thirteen of their Chiefs, even when fighting on his knees, and

when he fell, bravely telling who he was, and his being flead alive for his heroi&s;m, is &s;o fre&s;h in every one's memory (being not above &s;ix Years ago) that many living evidences can te&s;tify it; I thought the action worthy of this attempt, to &s;ave it from oblivion. They have de&s;erted ma|ny of their ea&s;tern frontier towns &s;ince their pre|&s;ent war with the Creeks, but during my &s;tay in their nation, i &s;aw four or five in&s;tances of their not &s;uffering their enemy to e&s;cape unpu|ni&s;hed, when he dared to commit depredations, and they valued them&s;elves on the event of the pre&s;ent war, when in 1771, news coming among the Traders, that the Creeks computed their lo&s;s at near three hundred per&s;ons, and they having gue&s;&s;ed the number of their's, lo&s;t much the &s;ame; they &s;aid, we have lo&s;t many women and children and even of them &s;ome Scalps have been retaken, but we like men, have killed men only, and got all the marks thereof; this war began in Augu&s;t 1765; the readers may judge at the greatne&s;s of their exploits, when i a&s;&s;ure them, that that number was the total lo&s;s during all that time.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;avages were the &s;taunch and firm friends of the French while they continued on the continent, until &s;ome Engli&s;h traders found means to draw the ea&s;t party, and the di&s;trict of <HI>Coo&s;a</HI> (which together are called <HI>Oypat-oocooloo,</HI> or the &s;mall nation) into a civil war with the we&s;tern divi&s;ions called <HI>Oocooloo-Falaya, Oocooloo-Hanal&eacute;,</HI> and <HI>Chicka&s;awhays,</HI> which after many conflicts and the de&s;truction of ea&s;t <HI>Congeeto,</HI> ended with the peace in 1763.

when they give into the intere&s;t of any per&s;on, and that their faith is to be better relied on than that of the Chica&s;aws or Creeks, which two la&s;t are really ver&s;ed in all the gallic tricks of deceit.</P>
<P>At the congre&s;s of 1771, there were two thou|&s;and three hundred of this nation nearly all men, at Mobile on the &s;uperintendants books; in the nation i found at above &s;eventy of their villages, about two thou&s;and men, and in the woods and hunting grounds, i was at and heard of as many camps as could make no le&s;s than &s;ix hundred men more. The French u&s;ed to keep them very poor, but the yearly &s;mall gifts they were ac|cu&s;tomed to, were more proper to leave an idea of gratitude on the mind of a &s;avage, than our &s;eptennial great ones.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur de Kerlerec and others made a fine juggle and kind of monopoly of this trade, which was very ill brooked by the French; but al|though i make no doubt of the Gentlemen's hav|ing gone beyond the orders of their court, and notwith&s;tanding i am a bitter enemy to unrea&s;on|able regraters, yet i am certain that a monopoly of this trade under proper re&s;trictions would prove an advantage and &s;ecurity to the colonies, &s;ince now the villainous over reachings, chica|nery, and mutual calumniations of the abandoned wretches, who re&s;ide among the &s;avages, joined to their wor&s;e than bruti&s;h or &s;avage way of life, tend to the rendering the nation to which they belong infamous, de&s;picable, and &s;candalous a|mong the &s;avages, as well as to turn the hopes of advantage into a real di&s;advantage; and i dare venture to &s;ay, that unle&s;s &s;uch re&s;trictions take place, the different &s;avages will always find

rea&s;on to complain again&s;t the colonies, and join in cabals again&s;t the poor &s;ettlers in the remote counties, and at la&s;t oblige the colonies to take the di&s;agreable &s;tep of realizing our mock au|thority, by extirpating all &s;avages that dare to remain on the Ea&s;t of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.</P>
<P>But to return to the war-like inclinations of the Chactaws, and not to involve my&s;elf in poli|ticks; i take them to be a brave people, who can upon occa&s;ion defend them&s;elves very coolly, for during my &s;tay in the nation, a woman of that tribe made a bargain with me to give her ammu|nition for &s;ome provi&s;ions i bought of her; and when i expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urpri&s;e thereat, &s;he in|formed me that &s;he kept a gun to defend her|&s;elf as well as her hu&s;band did; and i have &s;eve|ral times &s;een armed women in motion with the parties going in pur&s;uit of the invading enemy, who having completed their intended murder, were flying off.</P>
<P>They never exerci&s;ed &s;o much cruelty upon their captive enemies as the other &s;avages; they almo&s;t always brought them home to &s;hew them, and then di&s;patched them with a bullet or hatch|et; after which, the body being cut into many parts, and all the hairy pieces of &s;kin converted into &s;calps, the remainder is buried and the above trophies carried home, where the women dance with them till tired; then they are expo&s;ed on the tops of the hot hou&s;es till they are annihiliated. The &s;ame treatment is exerci&s;ed on tho&s;e who are killed near the nation, but he that falls in battle at a di&s;tance is barely &s;calped.</P>

when on an expedition which is remarkable, they carry with them a certain thing which they look on as the genius of the party; it is mo&s;t com|monly the &s;tuffed &s;kin of an owl of a large kind; they are very careful of him, keep a guard over him, and offer him a part of their meat; &s;hould he fall, or any other ways be di&s;ordered in po&s;i|tion, the expedition is fru&s;trated; they always &s;et him with his head towards the place of de&s;ti|nation, and if he &s;hould prove to be turned di|rectly contrary, they con&s;ider this as portending &s;ome very bad omen, and an ab&s;olute order to return; &s;hould therefore any one's heart fail him, he needs only watch his opportunity to do this to &s;ave his character of a brave or true man.

<P>Their exerci&s;es agree pretty much with what i have &s;een among other nations: from their infan|cy they learn the u&s;e of bows and arrows; they

are never beaten or otherways rudely cha&s;ti&s;ed, and very &s;eldom chid; this education renders them very willful and wayward, yet i think it preferable to the cruel and barbarous treatment indi&s;criminately u&s;ed by &s;ome European parents, who might with &s;light puni&s;hments by the ex|cellency of whole&s;ome chri&s;tian Admonitions, work in a very different manner on the tender inclinations of pliable infancy.</P>
<P>The young &s;avages al&s;o u&s;e a very &s;trait cane eight or nine feet long, cleared of its inward divi&s;ions of the joints; in this they put a &s;mall arrow, who&s;e one end is covered one third of the whole length with cotton or &s;omething &s;imi|lar to it: this they hold neare&s;t their mouth and blow it &s;o expertly as &s;eldom to mi&s;s a mark fifteen or twenty yards off and that &s;o violently as to kill &s;quirrils and birds therewith; with this in&s;trument they often plague dogs and other animals according to the innate di&s;po&s;ition to cruelty of all &s;avages, being encouraged to take a delight in torturing any poor animal that has the misfortune to fall into their hands; thinking be&s;t of him, who can longe&s;t keep the victim in pain, and invent the greate&s;t variety of tor|ture.

<P>Their play at ball is either with a &s;mall ball of deer &s;kin or a large one of woollen rags; the fir&s;t is thrown with battledores, the &s;econd with the hand only; this is a trial of &s;kill between village and village; after having appointed the day and field for meeting, they a&s;&s;emble at the time and place, fix two poles acro&s;s each other at about an hundred and fifty feet apart, they then at|tempt to throw the ball through the lower part of them, and the oppo&s;ite party trying to prevent it, throw it back among them&s;elves, which the fir&s;t again try to prevent; thus they attempt to beat it about from one to the other with amazing violence, and not &s;eldom broken limbs or di&s;lo|cated joints are the con&s;equence; their being al|mo&s;t naked, painted and ornamented with fea|thers, has a good effect on the eye of the by &s;tander during this violent diver&s;ion; a number is agreed on for the &s;core, and the party who fir&s;t gets this number wins.</P>
<P>The women play among them&s;elves (after the men have done) di&s;puting with as much eagerne&s;s as the men; the &s;takes or betts are generally high. There is no difference in the other game with the large ball, only the men and women play pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly, and they u&s;e no battledores.</P>
<P>Their favourite game of <HI>chunk&eacute;</HI> is a plain proof of the evil con&s;equences of a violent pa&s;&s;ion for
<PB N="80" REF="014440_0096_0F92641A1345CEB0">
gaming upon all kinds, cla&s;&s;es and orders of men; at this they play from morning till night, with an unwearied application, and they bet high; here you may &s;ee a &s;avage come and bring all his &s;kins, &s;take them and lo&s;e them; next his pipe, his beads, trinkets and ornaments; at la&s;t his blanket, and other garment, and even all their arms, and after all it is not uncommon for them to go home, borrow a gun and &s;hoot them|&s;elves; an in&s;tance of this happened in 1771 at <HI>Ea&s;t Ya&s;oo</HI> a &s;hort time before my arrival. Sui|cide has al&s;o been practi&s;ed here on other occa&s;i|ons, and they regard the act as a crime, and bury the body as unworthy of their ordinary funeral rites.</P>
<P>The mannner of playing this game is thus: They make an alley of about two hundred feet in length, where a very &s;mooth caly ground is laid, which when dry is very hard; they play two to|gether having each a &s;treight pole of about fif|teen feet long; one holds a &s;tone, which is in &s;hape of a truck, which he throws before him over this alley, and the in&s;tant of its departure, they &s;et off and run; in running they ca&s;t their poles after the &s;tone, he that did not throw it endeavours to hit it, the other &s;trives to &s;trike the pole of his antagoni&s;t in its flight &s;o as to prevent its hitting the &s;tone; if the fir&s;t &s;hould &s;trike the &s;tone he counts one for it, and if the other by the dexterity of his ca&s;t &s;hould prevent the pole of his opponent hitting the &s;tone, he counts one, but &s;hould both mi&s;s their aim the throw is re|newed; and in ca&s;e a &s;core is won the winner ca&s;ts the &s;tone and eleven is up; they hurl this &s;tone and pole with wonderful dexterity and vio|lence, and fatigue them&s;elves much at it.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="014440_0097_0F92641AB7BE4380">The women al&s;o have a game where they take a &s;mall &s;tick, or &s;omething el&s;e off the ground after having thrown up a &s;mall ball which they are to catch again, having picked up the other; they are fond of it, but a&s;hamed to be &s;een at it. I believe it is this propen&s;ity to gaming which has given the&s;e &s;avages an idea of a <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum</HI> above all other nations of America.</P>
<P>They are extravagant in their debauches; when met for a drinking match &s;ome women at|tend them, when the&s;e find the men beginning to be heated with liquor they will take away all the weapons found near them and return with a calleba&s;h under their wrappers, then mixing with them, the men offer them their bottles, they take a draught and when not ob&s;erved they empty it into the calleba&s;h, which when full they empty into bottles brought for that purpo&s;e, and thus they will accumulate two or three bottles full, and with the help of a little water, &s;till make them more; after a while rum fails among the men, and the women acquaint them, that they have got &s;ome; they are told to fetch it; they refu&s;e, &s;aying it co&s;t them much and they cannot give it for nothing; a bargain en&s;ues, they receive the con&s;ideration fir&s;t, and then bring it; in this way of trade they will often get all the effects the men can command for &s;uch a deli|cate nectar.</P>

<P>They are well made both men and women; the women have agreeable features and counte|nances, but their na&s;ty way of life in general di&s;|figures them; tho&s;e that are cleanly are really at|tractive; the women disfigure the heads of their male children by means of bags of &s;and, flattening them into different &s;hapes, thinking it adds to their beauty; both men and women wear long hair, ex|cept &s;ome young fellows who begin to imitate the Chica&s;aw fa&s;hion, and both &s;exes mark their faces and bodies, particularly the women with indelible blue figures of fancy, among which is a great deal of voluted work of va&s;t variety.</P>

<P>Their buildings are exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Chica&s;aws.</P>
<P>Their way of life in general may be called in|du&s;trious, they will do what no uncompelled &s;a|vage will do, that is work in the field to rai&s;e grain; and one may among them hire not only a guide, or a man to build a hou&s;e, or make a fence, but even to hoe his grounds; nay they will for payment be your menial &s;ervants to the meane&s;t offices; no other un&s;ubdued &s;avage will do any more of all the&s;e than be your guide; they are very ingenious in making tools, uten&s;ils and furniture; i have &s;een a narrow tooth comb made by one of the&s;e &s;avages with a knife only out of a root of the <HI>Dio&s;pyros</HI> that was as well fini&s;hed as i ever &s;aw one with all the nece&s;&s;ary tools; this &s;hews their patience.</P>
<P>The Chactaws are very ho&s;pitable at their hun|ting camps, and there only they will entertain a &s;tranger at free co&s;t.</P>
<P>Here i mu&s;t relate a particular cu&s;tom of the&s;e people: When a deer or bear is killed by them, they divide the liver into as many pieces as there are fires, and &s;end a boy to each with a piece, that the men belonging to each fire may burn it, but the women's fires are excluded from this ce|remony, and if each party kills one or more ani|mals, the livers of them are all treated in the &s;ame manner.</P>

<P>They cultivate for bread all the &s;pecies and varieties of the <HI>Zea,</HI> likewi&s;e two varieties of that &s;pecies of <HI>Panicum</HI> vulgarly called guinea corn; a greater number of different <HI>Pha&s;eolus</HI> and <HI>Dolichos</HI> than any i have &s;een el&s;ewhere; the e&s;culent <HI>Convolvulus</HI> (vulgo) &s;weet potatoes, and the <HI>Helianthus Giganteus;</HI> with the &s;eed of the la&s;t made into flour and mixed with flour of the <HI>Zea</HI> they make a very palatable bread; they have carried the &s;pirit of hu&s;bandry &s;o far as to culti|vate leeks, garlic, cabbage and &s;ome other gar|den plants, of which they make no u&s;e, in order to make profit of them to the traders; they al&s;o u&s;ed to carry poultry to market at Mobile, al|though it lays at the di&s;tance of an hundred and twenty miles from the neare&s;t town; dunghill fowls, and a very few ducks, with &s;ome hogs, are the only e&s;culent animals rai&s;ed in the nation.</P>
<P>They make many kinds of bread of the above grains with the help of water, Eggs, or hickory milk; they boil the e&s;culent convolvulus and eat it with the hickory milk; they boil green ears of corn, they boil corn and beans together, and make many other preparations of their vegetables, but fre&s;h meat they have only at the hunting &s;ea&s;on, and then they never fail to eat while it la&s;ts; of their fowls and hogs they &s;eldom eat any as they keep them for profit.</P>
<P>In failure of their crops, they make bread of the different kinds of <HI>Fagus,</HI> of the <HI>Dio&s;pyros,</HI> of a &s;pecies of <HI>Convolvulus</HI> with a tuberous root found in the low cane grounds, of the root of a

<P>They prepare a kind of cloth out of the bark of a &s;pecies of <HI>Morus,</HI> and with its root dye it yellow; i have all the rea&s;on in the world to be|lieve, that this cloth might be manufactured into paper.</P>
<P>Buffaloe's wool al&s;o furni&s;hes them a material for a u&s;eful manufacture.</P>
<P>They likewi&s;e make blankets and other co|verings out of the feathers of the brea&s;ts of wild turkies by a proce&s;s &s;imilar to that of our wig makers, when they knit hair together for the purpo&s;e of making wigs.</P>
<P>They have a root by means of which they dye mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tances of a bright lading &s;carlet, but hitherto i have not been able to di&s;cover what it was.</P>
<P>Many among them are well acquainted with plants of every kind, and apply them judicially both externally and internally; to others again they attribute &s;upernatural virtues, for in&s;tance, there is one which they make u&s;e of to procure rain; for this purpo&s;e they have a number of people in their nation called rainmakers; the&s;e a&s;&s;emble in a de&s;erted field, and they boil this plant in a large pot, dancing and &s;inging round it with numberle&s;s aukward ge&s;tures; then if it

&s;hould happen to rain &s;oon after the jugglers boa&s;t the virtue of the plant; but &s;hould no rain follow, they &s;ay the phy&s;ick was not &s;trong enough; they take care however not to employ this rain compelling herb unle&s;s a cloudy day forebodes rain. The plant is very &s;ingular, and i believe a nonde&s;cript; i &s;aw two &s;pecies of it, but could not a&s;certain the genius; the &s;avages call it <HI>E&s;ta Hoola</HI> or the mo&s;t beloved.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable thing of the&s;e &s;avages is their inability to &s;wim, occa&s;ioned by their being remote from large waters; this art the people of <HI>Chica&s;ahay</HI> and <HI>Yoani</HI> who live on the banks of the <HI>Pa&s;ca Oocooloo</HI> enjoy alone, and incredible as it may appear, even mo&s;t of their hor&s;es partake of this inability, as many people and among others the Commi&s;&s;ary for the nation have in|formed me from their own experience.</P>
<P>They help their wives in the labour of the fields and many other works; near one half of the men have never killed a deer or turkey dur|ing their lives. Game is &s;o &s;carce, that during my circuit through the nation we never &s;aw any, and we had but two or three opportunities of eating veni&s;on in as many months; they take wives without much ceremony, and live to|gether during plea&s;ure, and after &s;eparation which is not very frequent, they often leave the &s;econd to retake the fir&s;t wife.</P>
<P>Fornication is among them thought to be a natural accident, therefore a girl is not the wor&s;e looked on for ten or a dozen &s;lips; but although they are not over jealous of their wives, they pu|ni&s;h adultery in the woman, unle&s;s &s;he happens to belong to a &s;tronger or more noted and nume|rous

family than the hu&s;band; in which ca&s;e he &s;carce ventures even to put her away; but if &s;he is doomed to &s;uffer, her puni&s;hment is to be at a publick place (for that purpo&s;e &s;et apart at every town) carnally known by all who choo&s;e to be pre&s;ent, young and old; thus the poor wretch after defending her&s;elf and &s;truggling hard with the fir&s;t three or four, at la&s;t &s;uffers motion|le&s;s the brutality of perhaps an hundred or an hundred and fifty of the&s;e barbarians; the &s;ame treatment is undergone by a girl or woman who belonging to another town or quarter of the na|tion, comes to a place where &s;he is a &s;tranger and cannot give a very good account of her&s;elf and bu&s;ine&s;s, or the rea&s;on of her coming there; this they call running through the meadow, and if a white man happens to be in the town, they &s;end him an offer or invitation to take the fir&s;t heat; they plead in excu&s;e for &s;o barbarous a cu|&s;tom, that the only way to di&s;gu&s;t lewd women is to give them at once what they &s;o con&s;tantly and eagerly pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>The education of their children i have already mentioned.</P>
<P>The women &s;uffer no more by child birth than any other &s;avage women; they retire into a place of &s;olitude at the time, and after delivery return to their daily labour; however while i &s;taid at <HI>Oka Altakkala</HI> in this nation one died in labour within about eighty yards of the hou&s;e i re&s;ided in.</P>
<P>There are no laws or regulations ob&s;ervable among the&s;e people, except the <HI>Lex Talionis,</HI> and although they have a &s;trict notion of di&s;tinction in property, and even divide their lands, we ne|ver

<P>In &s;ickne&s;s the juggling Quacks are con&s;ulted, and as they are naturally good connoi&s;&s;eurs in &s;imples, and judge pretty well of the nature of di&s;ea&s;es, they often &s;ucceed; but if a di&s;order is ob&s;tinate or incurable, the relations of the pati|ent a&s;&s;emble in his hou&s;e, bewail his misfortune, cry bitterly, take their leave of him, and he tells them how tired he is of life, that his misfortunes are un&s;ufferable, and that it is good he &s;hould die; upon this an univer&s;al howl is rai&s;ed, the neare&s;t male relation jumps on him, and violent|ly in a moment breaks the neck of the patient, and then they rejoice that his mi&s;ery is over, but lamentations for his departure &s;oon &s;ucceed.</P>

<P>They inhabit a noble and fruitful country, where a civilized people in future will enjoy all the earthly &s;weets they can wi&s;h for, and where the inhabitants will always be placed commodi|ou&s;ly for navigation, &s;o as with little trouble to bring all the valuable produce of a rich &s;oil &s;itu|ate in a temperate air of the middle latitudes to a market; in a word, i fore&s;ee this will become the &s;eat of trade and its attendant riches in North America.</P>

<P>Their way of life is in general very abundant; they have much more of veni&s;on, Bear, turkies; and &s;mall game in their country than their neigh|bours have, and they rai&s;e abundance of &s;mall cattle, hogs, turkeys, ducks and dunghill fowls (all which are very good in their kind) and of the&s;e they &s;pare not; the labour of the field is all done by the women; no &s;avages are more proud of being counted hunters, fi&s;hermen, and warri|ors: were they to cultivate their plentiful coun|try, they might rai&s;e amazing quantities of grain and pul&s;e, as it is they have enough for their home con&s;umption, they buy a good deal of rice, and they are the only &s;avages that ever i &s;aw that could bear to have &s;ome rum in &s;tore; yet they drink to exce&s;s as well as others; there are few towns in this nation where there is not &s;ome &s;a|vage re&s;iding, who either trades of his own &s;tock,

or is employed as a factor. They have more va|riety in their diet than other &s;avages: They make pancakes; they dry the tongues of their veni&s;on; they make a cau&s;tick &s;alt out of a kind of mo&s;s found at the bottom of creeks and rivers, which although a vegetable &s;alt, does not deli|quiate on expo&s;ing to the air; this they di&s;&s;olve in water and pound their dried veni&s;on till it looks like oakum and then eat it dipped in the above &s;auce; they eat much roa&s;ted and boiled veni&s;on, a great deal of milk and eggs; they dry peaches and per&s;immons, che&s;nuts and the fruit of the <HI>chamaerops,</HI> they al&s;o prepare a cake of the pulp of the &s;pecies of the <HI>pa&s;&s;i flora,</HI> vulgarly called may apple; &s;ome kinds of acorns they al&s;o pre|pare into good bread; the common e&s;culent <HI>con|volvulus</HI> and the &s;ort found in the low woods, both called potatoes, are eat in abundance among them; they have plenty of the various &s;pecies of <HI>Zea</HI> or maize, or the <HI>Pha&s;colis</HI> and <HI>Dolichos,</HI> and of different kinds of <HI>Panicum;</HI> bears oyl, honey and hickory milk are the boa&s;t of the country; they have al&s;o many kinds of &s;alt and fre&s;h water turtle, and their eggs, and plenty of fi&s;h; we like|wi&s;e find among them &s;alted meats, corned veni&s;on in particular, which is very fine; they cultivate a|bundance of melons; in a word, they have natu|rally the greate&s;t plenty imaginable; were they to cultivate the earth they would have too much; va&s;t numbers of hor&s;es are bred here, but of an indiffe|rent kind; and the&s;e &s;avages are the greate&s;t hor&s;e &s;tealers yet known: it is impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;ure of a hor&s;e wherever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;e fellows come.</P>

<P>Every afternoon a young &s;avage warns the vil|lage to dance; as &s;oon as it is du&s;ky they make a a fire of dry pitch pine, and round this they dance in a circle with many &s;trange ge&s;tures, po&s;tures, and cries; the women &s;ing regularly and &s;ome very prettily to the mu&s;ick of a kind of drum. I have heard them &s;ing, and &s;een them dance to no more than the words <HI>Yahoodela, Ya|hoyahena</HI> for above two hours.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion i mu&s;t not forget to mention an in&s;tance of female fondne&s;s for dre&s;s, which i &s;aw at one of the&s;e dancing a&s;&s;emblies: I ob&s;erved the women dre&s;&s;ed their legs in a kind of leather &s;tockings, hung full of the hoofs of the roe deer in form of bells, in &s;o much as to make a &s;ound exactly like that of the Ca&s;tagnettes; i was very de&s;irous of examining the&s;e &s;tockings and had an opportunity of &s;atisfying my curio&s;ity on tho&s;e of my landlady at her return home. I counted in one of her &s;tockings four hundred and ninety three of the&s;e claws; there were nine of the wo|men at the dance with this kind of ornament, &s;o that allowing each of them to have had the &s;ame number of hoofs, and eight hoofs to a deer, there mu&s;t have been killed eleven hundred and ten deer to furni&s;h this &s;mall a&s;&s;embly of ladies with their ornaments, be&s;ides which, earrings, bracelets, &amp;c. are by no means forgot; an in|&s;tance of luxury in dre&s;s &s;carcely to be paralleled by our European ladies.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="014440_0115_0F926431FB16FBD0">The men are al&s;o very fond of dre&s;s; my guide acro&s;s the Penin&s;ula, employed above two hours at his toilet, at Mr. Moultrie's hou&s;e, four miles from St. Augu&s;tine, before he would venture to &s;hew him&s;elf in town.</P>
<P>Their principal exerci&s;es at home are ball play|ing in the manner afore related, and the ju&s;t men|tioned dances; the women are employed, be&s;ides the cultivation of the earth, in dre&s;&s;ing the victu|als, preparing, &s;craping, braining, rubbing and &s;moaking the Roe &s;kins, making mack&s;ens of them, &s;pinning buffaloe wool, making &s;alt, preparing ca&s;&s;ine drink, drying the <HI>chamaerops</HI> and <HI>po&s;&s;iflora,</HI> making cold flour for travelling, ga|thering nuts and making their milk; likewi&s;e in making ba&s;kets, brooms, pots, bowls and other earthen and wooden ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>They live nearly in the &s;ame kind of habitati|ons as the two other nations already mentioned, except that their hot hou&s;es are not circular but oblong &s;quares; they learn their boys from their youth to endure all manner of hard&s;hips particularly &s;wimming in the colde&s;t weather; they make them frequently undergo &s;cratching from head to foot through the &s;kin with broken gla&s;s or gar fi&s;h teeth, &s;o as to make them all in a gore of blood, and then wa&s;h them with cold water; this is with them the <HI>Arcanum</HI> again&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es, but when they de&s;ign it as a puni&s;hment to the boys, they dry &s;cratch them (i. e) they apply no water after the operation, which ren|ders it very painful; they endeavour as much as po&s;&s;ible to teach them all manner of cruelty, by making them exerci&s;e it on the poor brute creati|on, in order to be the better ver&s;ed in it when

they want to exerci&s;e it on their own &s;pecies, and others of the human genus, when they unhappily become their enemies.</P>
<P>As ho&s;pitable as this nation is to friends, as irreconcileably inhuman are they to their enemies; there is hardly an in&s;tance of one mi&s;erable pri|&s;oner's ever having e&s;caped their barbarity; the torments they put the wretched victims to, are too horrid to relate, and the account thereof can only &s;erve to make human nature &s;hudder.</P>
<P>No nation has &s;o contemptible an opinion of us as the&s;e. They practice unnatural commerce with their own &s;ex to as high a degree as the Chica&s;aws; they, like all other &s;avages, are very fond of dogs, in &s;o much as never to kill one out of a litter, and it is not uncommon in the nation to &s;ee a dog very lean, and &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his misfortune as to &s;eek a wall or po&s;t for his &s;upport before he ventures to bark.</P>
<P>With regard to the women, their girls are the mo&s;t arrant prudes and coquets in the world, though they will never &s;cruple to &s;ell the u&s;e of their bodies when they can do it in pri|vate; a per&s;on who wi&s;hes to be accommodated here can generally be &s;upplied for payment, and the &s;avages think a young woman nothing the wor&s;e for making u&s;e of her body, as they term it; but it is a great fal&s;hood which has been re|lated of the&s;e &s;avages, that they exhort their young women to cohabitation with white men.</P>
<P>Polygamy is here allowed, though not gene|rally made u&s;e of; they marry without much ce|remony, &s;eldom any more than to make &s;ome pre&s;ents to the parents, and to have a fea&s;t or hearty regale at the hut of the wife's Father;
<PB N="98" REF="014440_0117_0F92643375A51FB0">
when once married the women are bound to the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;ervation of obedience and conjugal fidelity, &s;aying that &s;he that has once &s;old her&s;elf, can not any more di&s;po&s;e of any thing whatever; and of their wives they are the mo&s;t unrea&s;onably jealous of any nation under the &s;un. Adultery is puni&s;hed by &s;evere flagellations and lo&s;s of hair, no&s;e, and ears, in both parties, if they are taken; &s;ometimes they &s;pare the no&s;e of the man, and i have known &s;ome in&s;tances of white men having this misfortune and being obliged to ap|ply to the Commi&s;&s;ary, or the neare&s;t Governor for a certificate to &s;ecure them from the imputa|tion of the pillory.</P>
<P>Phy&s;ick, or the knowledge of it, is another thing in which they pride them&s;elves not a little, but they apply that name to all kinds of exor|ci&s;ms, juggling and legerdemain tricks, as well as to the knowledge of di&s;ea&s;es and the &s;imples proper to cure them.</P>
<P>Once a year, about July, the&s;e people put out all the fires throughout the nation; they fa&s;t the two next days; then the fire is lighted again ac|cording to their old fa&s;hion (i. e.) by drilling with a hard piece of wood on a &s;oft one till it catches which &s;oon happens, thus all the fires are again lighted and univer&s;al fea&s;ting en&s;ues.</P>
<P>The women are ju&s;t as ea&s;ily delivered as tho&s;e of the other &s;avages, and immediately after birth the infant is plunged into cold water.</P>
<P>They revere old age to exce&s;s; in extreme &s;ickne&s;s they will out of compa&s;&s;ion break the neck of the decrepid or lingering patient.</P>
<P>The dead are buried in a &s;itting po&s;ture, and they are furni&s;hed with a mu&s;ket, powder and ball,

a hatchet, pipe, &s;ome tobacco, a club, a bow and arrows, a looking gla&s;s, &s;ome vermillion and other trinkets, in order to come well provided in the world of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arkanzas, Kanzas, Kappas,</HI> or <HI>Kwappas</HI> are the only nation of any note after the three above named, with whom We&s;t Florida has any connection, notwith&s;tanding they live on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river; they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be about four hundred gun men.</P>
<P>This nation is famous for the death of <HI>Ferdi|nand Soto</HI> in the year 1543, after his immen&s;e journey from the Bay of <HI>Tampe</HI> through <HI>Apala|chia, Pen&s;acola, Mobile,</HI> and the Chica&s;aw nati|on, &amp;c. to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, by his hi&s;torian called <HI>Rio Grande;</HI> al&s;o the arrival of Mr. <HI>de la Salle,</HI> who in 1682, coming down this river and hav|ing taken formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this country, went further down to its mouth, ob&s;erved it in Lati|tude 29, went up again as far as <HI>Illinois,</HI> thence to <HI>Canada</HI> and France, from whence he returned with a &s;mall &s;quadron in 1684 to find the mouth of the river once more, but through ob&s;tinacy pa&s;&s;ed it &s;o far as to get into the Bay of <HI>St. Ber|nard</HI> and river <HI>Bravo,</HI> where lo&s;ing his ve&s;&s;els he attempted to find the <HI>Arkanzas</HI> a &s;econd time, but after a long and tedious journey of almo&s;t three years he &s;hared if po&s;&s;ible a wor&s;e fate than <HI>Soto,</HI> being murdered by his own people near the nation of the <HI>Caeni</HI> on the 29th of May 1687; this we gather from the writings of Mr. <HI>Joutel</HI> who was pre&s;ent at all the &s;cenes i have related, con|cerning this affair, and who pur&s;ued the journey to the <HI>Arkanzas</HI> and <HI>Canada;</HI> this nation were till lately the declared enemies of the Chica&s;aws;

their country is &s;aid to be exceeding fine, but as i have not &s;een it i can not judge of it, i never &s;aw above &s;ix of this race, therefore i only treat of them on account of their connection with the country i am de&s;cribing.</P>
<P>In general their manners are very like tho&s;e of all other &s;avages, but among them i find a cu|&s;tom not known by the other &s;outhern nations which is that of a fea&s;t of dogs fle&s;h at the de|claration of war, which is a common practi&s;e among all the northern tribes; we are al&s;o told that an <HI>Arkanza</HI> is counted a warrior in his na|tion for having killed his enemies dog.</P>
<P>As many various accounts have been given of the manner of a declaration of war by different &s;avages, i will here acquaint my reader of my having more or le&s;s per&s;onal knowledge or ac|quaintance with every tribe between the river St. Lawrence and the bottom of the gulph of Darien, and i think i can give the following as an account that will &s;tand the univer&s;al te&s;t in all that ex|tent.</P>
<P>When war has been re&s;olved on by the leading men of the nation, a fea&s;t is prepared and all the chief warriors are invited; after a great deal of &s;willing, the cau&s;e of the a&s;&s;embly is eloquently made knows by &s;ome Orator, and the intended ex|pedition &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of the a&s;|&s;embly; as &s;oon as it is approved of, they paint them&s;elves red or black, a&s;&s;ume a very ga&s;tly ap|pearance and behaviour, adorning them&s;elves many uncouth ways; they dance their war dances under a continual roar of the death whoop, every one relates the great actions of his ance&s;tors, and &s;ings the prai&s;es of his own, as well pa&s;t as fu|ture;</P>

<P>The practice of &s;calping their &s;lain enemy i believe is univer&s;al, but tho&s;e in the neighbour|hood of the Dutch colonies have laid it by for another, that of cutting off the hands, which was in con&s;equence of a reward the company gave them for the hands of &s;uch runaway blacks as joined the rebel Negroes, becau&s;e there were in|&s;tances of per&s;ons &s;calped who have recovered, but after the lo&s;s of hands they cannot any more u&s;e arms.</P>

<P>To give an idea of Indian hieroglyphick painting, i have &s;ubjoined the two following cuts; the fir&s;t is Chactaw, and means that an expedition by &s;eventy men, led by &s;even princi|pal warriors, and eight of inferior rank, had in an action killed nine of their enemies, of which they brought the &s;calps, and that the place where it was marked was the fir&s;t publick place in their territories where they arrived with the &s;calps.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is a painting in the Creek ta&s;te, it means, that ten of that nation of the Stag family came in three canoes into their enemies country, that &s;ix of the party near this place, which was at <HI>Oopah Ullah,</HI> a brook &s;o called on the road to the Chactaws, had met two men, and two wo|men with a dog, that they lay in ambu&s;h for them, killed them, and that they all went home with the four &s;calps; the &s;calp in the &s;tag's foot implies the honour of the action to the whole fa|mily.</P>

<P>Do we not &s;ee Solomon's words fully verified in Negroes? <HI>A &s;ervant will not an&s;wer though he under&s;tand.</HI> The very perver&s;e nature of this black race &s;eems to require the har&s;h treatment they generally receive, but like all other things, this is carried into the extreme; far be it from me to approve or recommend the vile u&s;age to which this u&s;eful part of the creation is &s;ubjected by &s;ome of our we&s;tern nabobs, but again&s;t the Phyllis of Bo&s;ton (who is the <HI>Phaenix</HI> of her race) i could bring at lea&s;t twenty well known in&s;tan|ces of the contrary effect of education on this &s;a|ble generation.</P>
<P>Treachery, theft, &s;tubbornne&s;s, and idlene&s;s, the fir&s;t in the more northern Negroes, and the three la&s;t in the <HI>Ebo, Angola,</HI> and <HI>Benin</HI> &s;laves are &s;uch con&s;equences of their manner of life at home as to put it out of all doubt that the&s;e qua|lities are natural to them and not originated by their &s;tate of &s;lavery.</P>

<P>The anecdotes of the &s;ublimity of Negroes

<P>Mr. <HI>Le Poivre</HI> has mentioned the making &s;ugar in <HI>Cochin China,</HI> by free men, but it has not been ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e free men make &s;mall quan|tities, and &s;ell it at the low rate they do, only becau&s;e others who employ &s;laves in the &s;ame or in the adjacent countries, &s;ell them at that price, which may be ea&s;ily proved, and con&s;equently oblige the others to do the &s;ame; nor that the&s;e free men live on the &s;ame diet as our &s;laves, and who will &s;ay that <HI>Cochin</HI> Chine&s;e &s;ugar after ex|portation &s;ells at a more rea&s;onable rate than Ja|van, Martinique, Jamaica, or any ea&s;tern or we&s;tern &s;ugar does.</P>
<P>Have not all the endeavours of the &s;everal Le|gi&s;latures in the We&s;t Indies to introduce more white or free people proved abortive, by rea&s;on of their general inability for labour in tho&s;e climates?</P>
<P>Is it not therefore better to employ tho&s;e, who labour at a &s;imilar work in their own &s;ultry coun|try, and in a &s;tate of &s;lavery too, than to make victims of men who can by no means be qualified for the fatigue of a &s;outhern plantation.</P>
<P>We have known not long ago &s;ugars &amp;c. as cheap in the We&s;t Indies as in the Ea&s;t; it is the increa&s;e of con&s;umption in Europe and North America that renders it dear: I affirm that in America, neither &s;ugar, rice nor indigo can be made by whites at three times the price it is made now by the blacks, and i al&s;o affirm that the We&s;t India lands are di&s;tributed among all nati|ons

<P>Can any one &s;ay that the favourites of man|kind (i mean liberty and property) are any where enjoyed in Africa?</P>
<P>The rhap&s;odical opinion that the earth pro|duces more when worked by free men than by &s;laves may do in theory but not in practice; the contrary is ea&s;ily made to appear; and i am cer|tain from the nature of the climates, that the &s;ame colonies when cultivated by free men would not produce one tenth part of what they do now; as for an equal di&s;tribution of property it is like Har|rington's <HI>Oceana</HI> or Sir Thomas More's <HI>Utopia.</HI></P>
<P>An European will outlive a Creole by means of his more regular life, not otherwi&s;e, and who knows not that Negroes attain with all their la|bour a much higher age than the generality of idle Whites.</P>
<P>The fooli&s;h argument of the &s;hortne&s;s of the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory, as well as lugging in the practice of Polygamy by the head and &s;houlders (al|though the text quoted is not to the purpo&s;e) is too mean to be refuted.</P>
<P>Let not therefore the narrow &s;y&s;tem of mora|lity adopted by &s;ome of our contemporary enthu|&s;ia&s;tical Philo&s;ophers re&s;train us from properly u&s;ing this naturally &s;ubjected &s;pecies of mankind; the impo&s;&s;ibility of an European's bearing the re|qui&s;ite labour in tho&s;e climes is now &s;o well a&s;|certained as not to require any elucidation, nor can any one pretend to &s;ay, that the po&s;terity of Eu|ropeans born in the torrid Zone ought to bear its inclemency; what labour can we expect from men brought up in ea&s;e and affluence? It is pretended

that our employing &s;laves is contrary to the pre|cepts of the founder of our mo&s;t holy religion, when he &s;ays: <HI>"Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf;"</HI> i need not make u&s;e of the confined ideas of the antient Jews, who thought that the title of neighbour did not extend to any thing beyond their own nation.</P>
<P>I will then affirm, that there is a fivefold &s;tate of &s;lavery, not only known or permitted; but commanded in God's holy word.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Tho&s;e who are condemned to &s;lavery for their crimes, which we but too often experience to be the ca&s;e with the &s;laves imported to us from Africa.</P>

<P N="3">3ly. Tho&s;e who are &s;old by their Parents, which cu&s;tom obtains among many people even the refined and civilized Chine&s;e, not to mention &s;ome chri&s;tians, but mo&s;t among the Negroes.</P>

<P>For the &s;econd read <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> chap. 9, v. 23.</P>
<P>Does not <HI>Exodus,</HI> chap. 21, v. 7, &s;hew, that a man might &s;ell his child as a &s;ervant, only giving the maid &s;ervant a privilege above men &s;ervants?</P>
<P>In the fourth ca&s;e i think that (without leaving the point in view) i may a&s;k, does not the &s;oldi|er &s;ell his liberty to his &s;overeign or other Prince for his pay be it for a time or for life?</P>
<P>Proverbs, chap. 11, v. 29, tell us, <Q>That the fool &s;hall be &s;ervant to the wi&s;e of heart.</Q> Chap. 22, v. 7, <Q>The rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower &s;hall be &s;ervant to the lender.</Q> Does not Je&s;us him&s;elf, Math. chap. 18. v. 25 make u&s;e of a parable fully to my pur|po&s;e? <Q>when he &s;ays: But for as much as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be &s;old, and his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Exodus</HI> chap. 21, v. 4, tells us that; <Q>if the ma&s;ter have given his &s;ervant a wife, and &s;he have born him &s;ons or daughters, the wife and her children &s;hall be her ma&s;ters.</Q></P>

&s;ubjects, their good behaviour being their ran|&s;om; but who, even among tho&s;e refined mora|li&s;ts, would emancipate his &s;lave without &s;ome reward either private or publick?</P>
<P>How <HI>Tacitus</HI> comes to be &s;o pat to the pur|po&s;e of this acute Philo&s;opher i have not been able to learn; nor is the quotation from the uni|ver&s;al hi&s;tory, or Mr. Robert&s;on of any more force: Since we are able then to get &s;laves in a lawful manner, why &s;hould we now be re&s;trained from buying them to cultivate our grounds, when all nations at all times have enjoyed that privilege?</P>
<P>Had not the well known Chri&s;tian Doctor of the Colo&s;&s;ian Church a &s;lave called <HI>Onefimus?</HI> did not this &s;lave run away (after having, as u&s;u|al with &s;laves, robbed his ma&s;ter) come to Rome and go to &s;ee St. Paul? Paul treated him kindly, in&s;tructed, converted, and bapti&s;ed him and &s;ent him back to his ma&s;ter with a letter full of godly eloquence to per&s;uade <HI>Philemon</HI> to forgive his &s;lave and re-e&s;tabli&s;h him in his favour, but by no means an exhortation, much le&s;s an order to &s;et him free.</P>
<P>It is not religion then nor chri&s;tian charity that forbids us to have &s;laves, but it commands us the duties we are to fulfil towards them, in|&s;tructing them to obey us, and us to u&s;e them as a part of the rea&s;onable creation.</P>
<P>Who knows not, that the Spaniards are &s;o much &s;laves that they can not well be more &s;o, were they bought by their King: And who, that is acquainted in the Spani&s;h dominions, knows not, that a modern Iberian does him&s;elf more honour by &s;aying <HI>(Soi Blanco)</HI> i. e. I am a

Had this anonymous writer in&s;tead of playing with the word &s;lavery, told us, that the Northern colonies had no occa|&s;ion for Negroes, he would have &s;aid more, than all he has advanced in his futile publication.</P>
<P>A Negroe at the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi is reckoned to bring in his ma&s;ter an hundred dollars per annum, be&s;ides his &s;hare towards all the provi&s;ion con&s;u|med in the family; Negroes in general are u&s;ed with more lenity there than in Carolina.</P>
<P>I have in my di&s;&s;ertation on the origin of the &s;avages, which has &s;welled beyond my intenti|on, made mention of a peculiar characteri&s;tic of the Negroe &s;pecies, here let me be allowed to mention that they, like all others of the different &s;pecies, and varieties of the human genus are born white, which colour &s;oon changes, but on the moment of birth in both &s;exes the exterior parts of generation will &s;hew, whether the per&s;on will be black, yellow, brown, red or any other colour known among mankind.</P>
<P>There is among the Negroes a kind of anoma|lous beings with white &s;kins, feeble eyes, &amp;c. which have been &s;o often de&s;cribed by other au|thors that i &s;hall not trouble my reader with a particular account of them; yet one ob&s;ervation i cannot forbear to make, which i believe will be found no le&s;s curious than new:</P>

<P>The manners and way of life of the white peo|ple in Florida, differ very greatly from tho&s;e in other provinces of America, particularly in re|&s;pect of cloathing; they are very plain, their dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;light wai&s;tcoa&s;t of &s;triped cot|ton, and a pair of trow&s;ers of the &s;ame, and often no coat; if any, it is a &s;hort one of &s;ome light &s;tuff; in winter a kind of &s;urtout, made of a blanket, and a pair of Indian boots is all the ad|dition; the women al&s;o dre&s;s light and are not very expen&s;ive; happy frugality!

goodne&s;s for the feeding of &s;wine, poultry, and indeed all animals, joined to its ea&s;y culture and prodigious increa&s;e, makes it de&s;erve a rank before all other grain after wheat: Its culture requires the ground to be thoroughly hoed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;avages anciently performed this with the &s;houlder blade of animals fixed on &s;taves.</NOTE> or plowed, &s;o as to make it entirely mellow, and break every clod, then holes are made at equal di&s;tances in regular rows, and four or five grains dropped in each and covered; in this part of the hu&s;bandry the greate&s;t mi&s;take is often made through over greedine&s;s of land, the holes ought to be at the regular di&s;tance of five feet, which will leave room for the hor&s;e or hand hoeing it much better, than if it was placed at four feet; &s;ome people are &s;o near minded as to plant them only three feet a part, but this prevents the free circulation of air through the rows, of which this grain &s;tands very much in need; this is &s;o evident, that on planting in the &s;ame field &s;ome corn at three, at four, or at five feet di&s;tance, (&s;uppo&s;e the &s;oil equally good) there will be a difference of &s;ix feet in the height of the plants, for the be&s;t land can not rai&s;e the crowded corn to above ten or twelve feet, whereas that through which the air has free acce&s;s, is frequently rai&s;ed to &s;ixteen, eighteen, and even twenty feet; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I write for Florida.</NOTE> nor is this the only difference, the crowded corn will not produce grain in any thing like the proporti|on of that which &s;tands at proper di&s;tances; a &s;tem of crowded corn will hardly ever furni&s;h above three ears, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e not above eight inches

<P>An acre will produce from &s;ixteen to eighteen hundred pound weight, manufactured grain, and one Negroe will attend three acres in a very com|pleat manner.</P>
<P>This grain cau&s;es a great con&s;umption of cy|pre&s;s and pine wood to be made into ca&s;ks; con&s;e|quently a great deal of coopers labour is nece&s;&s;ary, in which the planter ought to be obliged to em|ploy white men, it not being harder labour than is con&s;i&s;tent with our temperament and con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s of manufacturing rice in a great mea&s;ure re&s;embles that of peeling barley; the planter who has water at command manufactures by a water mill, con&s;equently cheaper than he who is obliged to do it by hor&s;es or by the ma|nual labour of his &s;laves.</P>
<P>This grain has one great article in its favour, that is the number of hands it employs in tran&s;|porting and exporting it, who may be truly &s;aid to live by it.</P>
<P>The machines for manufacturing it have been &s;o often de&s;cribed and figured, that they hardly ought to be introduced into a work that bears the name of conci&s;e.</P>

<P N="22">XXII. The <HI>Mulberry,</HI> de&s;erves our next notice for a two fold cloathing it provides us with.</P>
<P>Among my botanical articles the reader will find the de&s;cription of one of this cla&s;s, which i have all the rea&s;on in the world to believe to be the <HI>Morus papyrifera</HI> and which i have on <HI>page</HI> 20 <HI>of this volume</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Morus foliis palmatis, cortice filamento&s;a, fructu ni|gro, radice tinctoria.</HI></P>
<P>This tree is found in abundance in the North We&s;tern parts of Florida: The chactaws put its inner bark in hot water along with a quantity of a&s;hes and obtain filaments, with which they weave a kind of cloth not unlike a coar&s;e hempen cloth; i would propo&s;e to boil the bark in a &s;trong alkaline <HI>Lixivium,</HI> by which means i make no doubt but a very fine and durable thread of the nature of cotton, flax or hemp might be obtain|ed; the root of this &s;ame tree likewi&s;e yields an excellent yellow dye: But i &s;hall here treat of the article, which is mo&s;t commonly known to be produced by means of the mulberry tree, this is &s;ilk: A very &s;hort time about &s;ix weeks in the year will &s;uffice for all the labour requi&s;ite to acquire this valuable article, and that labour is &s;o light as only need children to attend it</P>
<P>The gathering of the leaves being the mo&s;t la|borious part of the work i would advi&s;e the &s;ow|ing

the &s;eed as it were at broad ca&s;t, &s;o that it may &s;pring up in form of wide hedges of about ten feet breadth leaving a lane of two feet between each pair, by this treatment the leaves may be gathered by means of a pair of &s;heers or if the hedges are narrower the hand may do it, without the di&s;agreable nece&s;&s;ity of climbing trees, which is always more or le&s;s attended with &s;ome danger, and as this is a female bu&s;ine&s;s, with indecency.</P>
<P>I am convinced mulberry bu&s;hes will grow thus and yield abundance of leaves and therefore this method is eligible before groves or orchards, which take up much room and have a dirty ef|fect during the fruit &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>All the &s;pecies of mulberry trees grow kindly in Florida and &s;ome people pretend the white kind to be be&s;t, but on my &s;tricte&s;t enquiries i could not find in what manner this affects the worms, but i would have the &s;ilk planter be very cautious if he has one kind in his nur&s;ery, &s;trictly to bani&s;h the other, becau&s;e this change of leaves is certainly the rea&s;on of &s;ome of the di&s;ea&s;es attending the worms: The remainder of the &s;ilk culture is no more than to keep the worms well fed, and the apart|ment where they are kept thoroughly clean; when they begin to acquire a certain tran&s;parency, the period of their &s;pinning or re&s;olving them&s;elves into a <HI>Chry&s;alis</HI> is at hand; then it is nece&s;&s;ary to put up bundles of &s;ome &s;light thin twigs between the &s;helves. The <HI>wild</HI> or <HI>dogs fennel</HI> affords a ready and proper material for it; here the worms will naturally enough mount upon and pitch on a place where to metamorpho&s;e them&s;elves into a cocoon; in Georgia we have a filature, likewi&s;e at Pury&s;|burg; but as there are none in Florida i will &s;ub|join

<P N="1">1&s;t. The cocoons are to be put into an oven ju&s;t hot enough to deprive the <HI>Chry&s;alis</HI> it involves of life, without hurting, the fibres of the cocoon:</P>
<P>A heat &s;omething below <HI>Fahrenheits</HI> &s;cale for boiling water will effect this: without this precau|tion the in&s;ect eats its way out and de&s;troys the thread of &s;ilk.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It mu&s;t then be put into a copper with water ju&s;t on the boil and kept &s;o, this will di&s;|charge the glutinous matter from the cocoon and di&s;cover the end of the clew; then taking &s;everal of the&s;e ends together they are gently reeled off, and afterwards &s;pun and prepared for the loom.</P>
<P>This proce&s;s is hurtful to the ela&s;ticity and &s;trength of the &s;ilk, though it does not deprive it of its glo&s;s: Therefore if we could attain the knowledge how the raw &s;ilk is managed in the <HI>Levant,</HI> it would be the mo&s;t eligible way; all we know about this is, that it is performed with|out hot water: this is called raw &s;ilk and comes in bales to England and other manufacturing coun|tries.</P>
<P>The refu&s;e cocoons either damaged by the in|&s;ect or other ways, are carded in Europe, and are then improperly &s;tiled raw &s;ilk; this &s;hould not be confounded with the above named from the <HI>Levant,</HI> being by no means equal to it. After the &s;ilk is reeled off, we find &s;ome irregular coar|&s;er kind on the inner divi&s;ion of the cocoon; da|maged cocoons are mixed with this, as al&s;o the inner divi&s;ion next over the <HI>Chry&s;alis,</HI> after being &s;teeped in warm water to di&s;&s;ipate its gelatinous parts; this mixture is carded and called <HI>floretting.</HI></P>

<P>The plants are at this period out of danger of being &s;cratched out of the ground by a large flock of turkies which may now be turned into the field, who will not touch the plants but carefully look for the worms that infect them, of which tho&s;e birds are very fond; and thus they will &s;ave a great deal of labour, but the &s;uckers mu&s;t be at|tended to by human labour, which is al&s;o requir|ed to keep the ground clear from weeds; when the plant attains the heighth of eighteen inches it mu&s;t be deprived of its head and &s;tripped of its lowermo&s;t leaves, re&s;erving a few with their heads on for &s;eed: In about eleven weeks after they are tran&s;planted the plants cea&s;e growing and the leaves a&s;&s;ume a variegated colour of different green &s;hades; this is an indication of their matu|rity;

they are then cut and laid in heaps to &s;weat for about &s;ixteen hours; next day they are car|ried to a &s;hed, &s;o con&s;tructed as to admit a free circulation of air through every part thereof, but well covered again&s;t rain; this is the practice in Virginia; in &s;ome countries they keep all the light out except where the rays cannot immedi|ately reflect on the tobacco; in this &s;hed they are hung with their tops downwards for about &s;ix weeks; then taking advantage of a day when the atmo&s;phere is pretty much loaden with moi&s;|ture, they are laid on a kind of floor of poles, and left to &s;weat for about ten or twelve days; now the leaves are &s;tripped off and the tops kept &s;epa|rate from the middle and the lower leaves; the uppermo&s;t leaves being the be&s;t tobacco and the lower the wor&s;t; they are then made up into very clo&s;e packed bundles called in Florida <HI>Carrots,</HI> which are held together by a &s;tring of bark; there are at pre&s;ent but two &s;orts produced viz <HI>Nanqui|toche</HI> and <HI>Pointe coup&eacute;e,</HI> the fir&s;t infinitely &s;uperior to the &s;econd.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. Pitch, tar and turpentine being the produce of vegetables will not improperly come in here; the proce&s;s of making the common tar is by &s;plitting the heart of the pitch pine, fallen down (with which the ground is covered in the ea&s;tern and &s;outhern parts of Florida) into &s;mall &s;ticks of the length of about three feet, and ar|range them into a kiln of a circular form; but as this is a proce&s;s hardly to be learned by theory, i will recommend it to the inqui&s;itive reader to in|form him&s;elf at a tar kiln great or &s;mall, which are a very common occurrence thoughout this continent,</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="014440_0171_0F926474B10A9C78">Sometimes this kind of tar is made of pine knots without &s;plitting.</P>
<P>The green tar has not yet been made in Flori|da and until i gave &s;ome account of the proce&s;s to &s;ome of the planters there, it was intirely un|known in the country.</P>
<P>This is made from trees that have been tapped for turpentine, and continued running for about three years, by chopping the bark off by degrees to twelve or fifteen feet high; they are then cut down and &s;plit into &s;mall &s;ticks; and the tar is made by the &s;ame operation as the common &s;ort.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great quantities of pitch pine in Florida, turpentine has not yet been made there; even in February 1773 when i was at <HI>Orleans,</HI> there being a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ome turpen|tine on board of the ve&s;&s;el (in which i came from thence) the Captain was obliged to pay &s;ixteen dollars for a half ca&s;k of it, and i have been in|formed, that even then it was &s;old in that town for medicinal u&s;es at a great price by the pint and quart.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s is very &s;imple; a hole is cut in the tree on the &s;ide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t expo&s;ed to the &s;olar rays (in large trees two of the&s;e may take place) the&s;e holes are cut &s;lanting downwards leaving the bottom concave and large enough to intro|duce a caleba&s;h to dip out the gum, which depo|&s;its its &s;elf in the bottom of the hole; this hole is called a box, and the turpentine is dipped out of it and put in ca&s;ks: Florida, e&s;pecially the Ea&s;tern and Southern parts, has the advantage for this bu&s;ine&s;s of the more Northern provinces by not being tied down to any particular &s;ea&s;on, the climate admitting of this work the year round.</P>

<P>As a hint to travellers, in the &s;outhern parts of <HI>America,</HI> where the di&s;tance between the &s;ettle|ments often obliges us to carry our provi&s;ions with us, i will a&s;&s;ure them, that the fruit of this kind, &s;teeped a very &s;hort time in water, com|municates to it a very agreeable acid flavor, which will render it very fit to make punch; which agree|able liquor proves a great refre&s;hment in a hot day, in the woods.</P>
<P>Another kind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a noxious quality; this grows in low grounds; beware therefore of mak|ing &s;pits of this to roa&s;t meat on, and take it for a general rule not to employ any wood (unle&s;s you are well acquainted with it) growing in low grounds for that purpo&s;e, as almo&s;t all the noxious plants, of this country, are found in &s;uch &s;itua|tions; in high grounds you may indi&s;criminately u&s;e any wood (which has no bad ta&s;te) for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>It is likewi&s;e &s;aid, that <HI>Madder</HI> is an excellent food for cattle, that it increa&s;es milk, and cau&s;es the butter to have a mo&s;t agreeable color and fla|vor; i know it to be &s;ometimes cut for hay and we are told, that it makes an excellent fodder.</P>
<P>This plant does undoubtedly de&s;erve our atten|tion in <HI>Florida,</HI> on the above accounts, e&s;pecially as the many trials to grow it to advantage in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;eem for the mo&s;t part un&s;ucce&s;sful. Ma|ny different kinds of madder have been tried for this purpo&s;e, but none have yet proved of real u&s;e except the <HI>Rubia Tinctorum Sativa</HI> of <HI>C. Bau|hine,</HI> which is the &s;ort cultivated in <HI>Zealand,</HI> and &s;ome parts of <HI>Au&s;trian Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>If it be objected to the culture of Madder in <HI>Florida,</HI> that the&s;e are in a very different climate from the &s;outhern part of <HI>Briti&s;h America,</HI> let it be remembered that in the <HI>Levant</HI> it is cultivated with &s;ucce&s;s, and that what comes from thence is a more valuable dye.</P>
<P>The ground in which Madder thrives be&s;t &s;eems to be a deep black mould, in &s;omething of a low &s;ituation, which &s;hould not have a clay founda|tion, but &s;and or gravel; the land in <HI>Zeeland</HI> is, and that on the river <HI>Amite,</HI> &s;eems to be in gene|ral of this kind.</P>
<P>It is cultivated in <HI>Zeeland</HI> by offsets, or &s;hoots, which they take from an old plantation, and re|plant immediately in rows, about eighteen inches apart; the young plants have each a di&s;tance of
<PB N="160" REF="014440_0181_0F9264824A6E4DA8">
four inches allowed them, and the ground is di|vided into beds of twelve feet wide, leaving a ditch of about twenty inches between them; this is done in the beginning of May, and great care is taken that no offset is planted, without it be furni&s;hed with fibres; as it is thought that for want of fibres they would mi&s;carry, which they often do even in the mo&s;t favourable &s;ea&s;ons. The greate&s;t labour, i think, i have &s;een the people at in <HI>Holland,</HI> in re|gard to this culture, is the covering the &s;talks, when they attain the height of about &s;ixteen inches, leaving only the tops bare, in order to pro|mote the multiplication of roots, which is the part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the plant manufactured and &s;old; when this covering is performed, there remains only the at|tention of weeding, which ought to be done often; the root is generally taken up the &s;econd year, but i think i have heard it &s;aid, as well as read it, that three &s;ummers are nece&s;&s;ary for this crop to come to full maturity; the roots, which are &s;aid to yield the mo&s;t and be&s;t dye, have been taken up, when they had obtained about three tenths of an inch diameter in &s;ize; it is thought that when they grow too large, they yield a dye more inclining to yellow than red.</P>
<P>The lateral fibrous ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icular roots, are &s;aid to yield a &s;uperior dye, but not to pay for the expence nece&s;&s;ary for gathering them.</P>
<P>From this general &s;ketch of the Madder cul|ture, &s;uch as it is in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeeland,</HI> my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs may &s;ee, that it is not &s;o expen&s;ive an af|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as it is generally deemed to be, but like all o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er things the cultivation of this plant may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d on at too co&s;tly a rate, and it likewi&s;e may be attempted in too penurious a way: I have en|deavoured
<PB N="161" REF="014440_0182_0F9264832844DA68">
to make my writing intelligible to every capacity, and therefore hope, that every one of my readers may be led into the true idea of this culture, to make it an&s;wer the purpo&s;e in <HI>Florida.</HI></P>
<P>This cultivation by &s;ets or &s;hoots being prac|ti&s;ed in countries where the &s;eed does not at all, or very difficultly come to maturity, i think the &s;eed ought to be introduced into <HI>Florida,</HI> or endea|vours made to obtain it, from plants to be car|ried or tran&s;planted there, which, if productive of &s;eed, it ought to be &s;own in drills, like rice; which i would think the mo&s;t elegible in the mo|derate climates of tho&s;e provinces. I believe this plant to be a great impoveri&s;her of the &s;oil, for in <HI>Zeeland</HI> they always allow &s;ome years between eve|ry two crops in the &s;ame &s;pot.</P>
<P>As it has lately been &s;aid, that there was no ne|ce&s;&s;ity for drying Madder, and that in u&s;ing it green, there is even in the evaporation of dying matter a &s;aving of one half, be&s;ides the greater &s;aving of the expences of a kiln, a mill, a drying hou&s;e, &amp;c. I mu&s;t inform my reader, that he will find all this true, but then it will be nece&s;|&s;ary for him to tran&s;port the dying hou&s;es from <HI>Europe</HI> to our Madder fields, and not the Madder to the dyers, in order to enjoy the profits of all this great and oeconomical frugality; for per|haps there is not a plant on earth &s;o &s;oon inclining to fermentation and putrefaction, which is occa|&s;ioned by its &s;ucculency; yet for the planters pre|&s;ent family-u&s;e it is certainly fit to u&s;e green; as &s;oon as the roots have become &s;potted, or black, or lo&s;t a &s;trong &s;cent (&s;imilar to that of liquorice) they are utterly unfit for any u&s;e; i &s;hall therefore make a few remarks, nece&s;&s;ary to be known for
<PB N="162" REF="014440_0183_0F926483C094B268">
the drying proce&s;s in <HI>Florida.</HI> A hot, &s;un-&s;hiny day may be u&s;ed to advantage, to dry the roots partially; but if the weather be not favourable, when the roots are taken up, they mu&s;t be &s;pread within doors on a floor, taking care to &s;pread them thinly, and &s;tir them often; but this will never ab&s;olutely pre&s;erve them from changing, much le&s;s make them fit for tran&s;portation to any di&s;|tance; if the crop be &s;mall, a baker's oven may &s;uffice, but beware of rai&s;ing the heat above 180 degrees of <HI>Farenheit</HI>'s thermometer in the place where the roots are put, which &s;hould be over the oven; but for larger crops kilns, &s;imilar to malt-kilns are nece&s;&s;ary; take care to make them roomy, keep an equal and moderate heat, and by all means prevent any the lea&s;t acce&s;s of &s;moke to the roots; for which rea&s;on I would advi&s;e large ovens, &s;uch as the bi&s;cuit bakers in <HI>Holland</HI> u&s;e, as preferrable to every other method; a build|ing may be &s;o contrived as to contain 13 ovens, viz. four on each &s;ide, three at one end, and two at the end where the door is, with one general brick floor over all; one or two windows may be &s;o contrived as to give acce&s;s to a &s;ufficient light; let us &s;uppo&s;e the oven ten feet long, by eight wide, and allow two feet for each partition, this will make an oblong apartment of forty-two feet by thirty-two in the clear below, and on the up|per floor fifty-two, by forty-two, room enough for any crop; provide good brick funnels to your chimnies, and there can be no danger of fire, the re&s;t of the building may be of timber; in this proce&s;s Madder will loo&s;e five &s;ixths of its weight.</P>
<P>When the roots are &s;ufficiently dried, they mu&s;t be pounded in wooden mortars; for this purpo&s;e
<PB N="163" REF="014440_0184_0F926484861407C0">
a mill con&s;tructed exactly like the old fa&s;hioned rice mills is very proper, only varying in the &s;hape of the lower end of the pi&s;til, or beetle; for in the rice mills their lower end is in form of an inverted cone; but here the lower end ought not only to terminate in a &s;quare, but the but-end ought to be cut into &s;mall &s;quares, &s;o as to render the pe&s;tle toothed; for this rea&s;on al&s;o the mortar ought to be of a different form from the rice mortar, which la&s;t is likew&s;e an inverted cone, or &s;haped like the &s;ide of the top of a funnel, whereas this ought to be in form of a hollow globe, which has a neck like a decanter or bottle, in which neck the pe&s;tle ought nearly to fit.

<P>It will then be fit for packing into ca&s;ks and exporting.</P>
<P>I remember to have heard it &s;aid in <HI>Holland,</HI> that poor people, in order not to be obliged to &s;ell their &s;mall crops to the manufacturer, at his own price, pre&s;erve the roots from fermentation, by burying them between layers of earth in the ground, and that by this means it may be pre|&s;erved for any term of time, without perceptible alteration.</P>

<P>This plant bears fruit &s;ufficient to defray the yearly expences at the end of the third year; its produce will then increa&s;e until the &s;eventh year, and after this it will continue to bear in a degree nearly equal, until about the fortieth year of its age, when it begins to decay.</P>
<P>If any of the young plants &s;hould fail, they ought immediately to be replaced by others.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Dutch</HI> colonies, when a coffee walk de|cays,
<PB N="165" REF="014440_0186_0F92648607B2DB10">
they root the trees out, and let the ground lay fallow for ten years, or upwards, during which time it affords pa&s;ture for cattle, and afterwards it is turned into a cocoa walk, or cotton plantation.</P>
<P>The ordinary height of this tree is from twelve to &s;ixteen feet; in the <HI>Dutch</HI> colonies they are lopped, to reduce them to a kind of <HI>E&s;paliers,</HI> for the ea&s;ier gathering of the fruit.</P>
<P>When the coffee has attained to ripene&s;s, it is carried to drying &s;heds, which are con&s;tructed in the <HI>Dutch</HI> colonies on the following plan:</P>
<P>The <HI>Area</HI> of the ground generally applied to this u&s;e is &s;eventy feet by thirty; a brick founda|tion of four, five or &s;ix feet high, is fir&s;t laid to rai&s;e the building from the ground; on this the building is placed of timber, being of two &s;tories; the upper floor is about twelve feet above the lower; in each &s;ide of the building are from twelve to &s;ixteen large windows likewi&s;e two at each end, on each &s;ide of large doors, all this is nece&s;&s;ary to give a free acce&s;s to the air, to pre|vent the coffee from heating or &s;hooting. In the lower part of the building a kind of drawers, of about &s;ix feet &s;quare are &s;o contrived as to be drawn without &s;ide the building, where they re&s;t on wooden rollers or blocks, the&s;e drawers re|ceive the coffee after the drying floor, and in fine weather are drawn out, but pu&s;hed back the mo|ment it begins to rain; by this contrivance a large quantity is, as it were, in&s;tantly &s;heltered from ru|in; no other invention can be &s;o expeditious.</P>
<P>The building mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with two pieces of &s;quare timber, of the length of twenty-five or thirty feet, and about eighteen, or twenty-four inches thick, made of hard wood; in the&s;e a row

of mortars is &s;unk, to beat the coffee in, pe&s;tles or beatles for the &s;ame, fanning mills to clean the coffee, &s;hovels for turning it often while it lies on the upper floor; a competent number of ba&s;|kets, of different &s;izes, and a pair of &s;cales with weights. Before this building there are generally one or two platforms, from forty to fifty feet &s;quare, called drying floors, intended to take all benefit of the fine drying weather during the cof|fee harve&s;t. Adjoining to the building is general|ly a &s;maller one, containing a cooper's &s;hop and a mill, called a breaking mill, through which the new gathered coffee pa&s;&s;es, to deprive the grain of its pulp, or red outer &s;kin; after coming from this mill it is &s;oaked during one night in water, and next day &s;pred upon the drying floors, where it remains till the air and wind have &s;ufficiently dried it; if rain &s;hould happen it is quickly ga|thered into heaps, and covered with &s;ear cloth.</P>
<P>The coffee, being thus dried, is put into the drawers, where it is left till thoroughly dry; from hence it is carried into the loft (being now only &s;urrounded with a thin, &s;emi-tran&s;parent hu&s;k over each pair of &s;eeds) where it is left till the whole crop is gathered; the harve&s;t la&s;ting often two months; while it remains in the loft it mu&s;t be daily turned, to prevent its heating, and in good weather all the air po&s;&s;ible mu&s;t be admitted; after harve&s;t it is again returned into the drawers, and left there for three or four days, in order to become totally dry, it is then pounded or beat in the above mortars by hand, to deprive it of the thin, inner hu&s;k, which involves every pair of &s;eeds; after this it is fanned, and when fanned the broken grains are &s;eparated from the whole,

<P>Even in their native country the &s;eeds are very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iable to mi&s;carriage, therefore they plant ten or twelve in each hole, in rows throughout the field; <HI>Kempfer,</HI> who had the be&s;t opportunity of infor|mation, tells us, that the plants are left to grow till &s;even or eight years before the leaves are ga|thered; but he &s;hould have told us, whether this was nece&s;&s;ary to the perfection of the leaves, or on|ly done on account of the quantity obtainable, perhaps to &s;trip them younger would de&s;troy the plants: I think he al&s;o &s;ays, that after ten years the plant is cut down, and young &s;hoots &s;pring up, or the plantation is entirely removed.</P>
<P>In the gathering, it is &s;aid, much time is taken up, each per&s;on culling not above two or three pounds per day, it being done leaf by leaf; dur|ing the time a &s;heet is &s;pread over the bu&s;h, in form of a canopy, to prevent the leaves drying ha&s;tily, in the &s;un-&s;hine, which would exhale the flavour; it is &s;aid al&s;o, that they have three crops, viz. in the end of <HI>February,</HI> this is the be&s;t; then in the end of <HI>March,</HI> and beginning of <HI>April,</HI> and the

He further &s;ays, &s;ome dealers in tea, in <HI>England</HI> are not ignorant that certain <HI>Euro|pean</HI> leaves, particularly tho&s;e of the <HI>Dog Ro&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Cherry tree</HI> may be &s;o coloured as to pa&s;s for good Bohea.

<P>Reducing the rough timber into boards is now the mo&s;t common branch of bu&s;ine&s;s in the &s;outh|ern colonies, that comes under the name of ma|nufactures: a pair of negro &s;awyers are taxed to cut an hundred feet per diem, this the indu&s;|trious ones often perform by two o'clock, or &s;ooner, they are then &s;uffered to cut lumber for their own u&s;e the re&s;t of the day, or do any other bu&s;ine&s;s, for which their ma&s;ters pay them; the&s;e hundred feet <HI>per diem,</HI> are &s;ix hundred per week, or thirty-one thou&s;and two hundred <HI>per annum,</HI> which, allowing them to be only inch boards, and to &s;ell at &s;ix &s;hillings &s;terling per hundred, is &pound;. 93,

of a &s;cheme to turn this &s;olitude to advantage; to effect this he employed &s;everal &s;avages of the Chactaw nation in the cutting of cedar trees, and made tho&s;e of his little garri&s;on who were able and willing for a reward to do it, &s;quare the timber, and form &s;ome of it into a very &s;trong frame of a hou&s;e of about &s;ixty foot by twenty-five, which frame was next &s;pring erected on an i&s;land or gravel bank, about two miles below the fort, and during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, and re|ce&s;s of the waters, this frame was filled with the &s;quared timber, which as effectually &s;ecured again&s;t removing.

benefit. The trade for furs is a fifth article of importance, and is already very great; to men|tion <HI>rice, indigo, tobacco,</HI> &amp;c. would be &s;uperfluous. But i have one material point to mention, i have often wondered at the &s;tupidity of people let loo&s;e in a certain part of the field of commerce: i mean the trade with the Spaniards, the deceit|ful appearance of which has led many into ruin, and yet intoxicates every one who is &s;o unfortunate as to &s;tray within its bounds to a degree of mad|ne&s;s. The generality of traders this way, con&s;i|der only the price of things as they formerly &s;tood, and not that the&s;e articles are much fallen in their price on the Spani&s;h coa&s;ts; the danger attending this trade they de&s;pi&s;e, though it too often proves fatal; the delays on the coa&s;t are not &s;o much as thought of, and the perfidy of the Spani&s;h traders forgot; the under&s;elling by Dutch and French traders, although very real, is thought chimerical, and &s;o on; in &s;hort, the pro&s;pect is here &s;o gilded over, that nothing but profits appear, where nothing but certain and inevitable lo&s;s can be expected, the fatal mi&s;take of over-&s;tocking every part of America with European manufactures, is a kind of obligation, or rather compul&s;ion on us to &s;trike out into &s;uch pernicious branches of trade to the ruin of tho&s;e who are intere&s;ted, as well here as in Eu|rope. Be then advi&s;ed, and let no vain hopes intoxicate you, have patience, and if you import goods from Europe with views of profit, import them in moderate quantities, unle&s;s long credit or abundance of money enable you to wait pa|tiently for the arrival of the Spaniards on our own coa&s;t; and let none of our ve&s;&s;els frequent

Believe me, an American Spaniard will give you more for your goods at your own hou&s;e than he will on his coa&s;t, and by coming to us he &s;eems to loo&s;e all his cunning, which in fact is only owing to our eagerne&s;s of compleating a voyage when we arrive on their coa&s;ts. More branches of trade are not at pre|&s;ent to be mentioned, becau&s;e none have as yet appeared in this country to be worth pur&s;uing, but an immen&s;e variety mu&s;t and will in the cour&s;e of nature make their apperance.</P>
<P>Having now explained my meaning in re&s;pect of the commercial intere&s;t of the country, i will &s;ay a few words on the benefits ari&s;ing from the population of the&s;e and other &s;imilar provinces It is an undoubted fact, which has been long ago taken notice of,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Sir Jo&s;iah Child, in his di&s;cour&s;e on trade, p. 149.</NOTE> that one man tran&s;planted into the colonies creates work for four or five in the mother country; a late writer <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Campbell's con&s;iderations on the &s;ugar trade.</NOTE> agrees with this in &s;aying, that numbers of people who would have migrated to foreign countries, or done wor&s;e, are, by coming here pre&s;erved, and when become rich, return home. I mu&s;t, however, differ in opinion from a third,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Political e&s;&s;ays, p. 359.</NOTE> who has quoted both the&s;e, and expre&s;&s;es his opinion, by &s;aying, that emigrants ought to be made &s;ettle where

they may be beneficial to Great-Britain; his &s;aying would be ju&s;t if a migration to the nor|thern colonies was pernicious, but this is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e, that people there love room as much as any where; the continual and of late exce&s;&s;ive importation of &s;ettlers into the&s;e colo|nies is an evident proof of this, for by means of the&s;e, even the natives are obliged to look out for habitations where they are more at liberty to encrea&s;e, not only the nece&s;&s;aries of life to which they are at pre&s;ent confined, but al&s;o profitable &s;taples for the mother country. A very &s;triking proof of this appears at pre&s;ent in every one of the northern colonies, though in none &s;o much as in Connecticut, who&s;e very hill-tops are inhabited full; tho&s;e migrations ought therefore to be encouraged, becau&s;e they will na|turally find their way to the more favourable climates and &s;oil of the &s;outhern colonies. It is al&s;o the intere&s;t of the &s;outhern colonies to en|courage the migrations from the northward, for fear the&s;e la&s;t might by being confined within their prolific regions be in time induced to think of forming bodies of modern Goths and Vandals to over-run and invade the territories of their more happily &s;ituated &s;outhern neighbours. I am therefore induced to think, that (however &s;trange it may appear that a people in one hun|dred and fifty years time &s;hould increa&s;e &s;o rapidly as the&s;e have done) there is a nece&s;&s;ity even now to enlarge their territories; in this i agree with the la&s;t quoted writer, and if Britain wants to &s;ecure the dependency of the&s;e colonies, it is ab|&s;olutely incumbent on her to allow this, contrary to &s;ome late ill judged &s;chemes as this may

No, the pro&s;pect is too fine, numbers of families have through the natural cour&s;e of the increa&s;e of mankind &s;ettled them|&s;elves on the lands intended lately for a new pro|vince on the Ohio: if i am rightly informed, no le&s;s than fifteen hundred families already, and many others on places not yet &s;o much as thought of in Britain. The&s;e are the people who are mo&s;t likely to form independencies, and not the known provinces; what ideas have the&s;e people of the paltry fear of a war with a few &s;avages, (for in the northern America they are but few) not that i would be thought to imagine that the&s;e la&s;t mentioned provinces would not &s;trike in with them in ca&s;e of favourable oppor|tunities; what if &s;ome enterprizing genius among tho&s;e di&s;per&s;ed inhabitants &s;hould form an idea of becoming a great man, and by in&s;inuating him&s;elf among the mo&s;t: we&s;tern tribes of &s;avages (who never having had intercour&s;e with us, nor any other white people, &s;uch for in&s;tance are the <HI>Nadoue&s;&s;ins,</HI> who are &s;aid to be a people remark|ably tractable) would incorporate a body of whites with them, and form combinations with other neighbouring nations, and thus form them|&s;elves into a regular &s;tate. Such a &s;tate would undoubtedly &s;oon become formidable, and be daily increa&s;ed by &s;uch men as for want of room would leave the crouded provinces. The&s;e, &s;up|po&s;ing them at fir&s;t vagabonds, or little better, when they &s;hould find them&s;elves in a place where they might po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;weets of life at ea&s;e, would find it their intere&s;t to become united with the common weal; therefore, i &s;ay again, that &s;ince

All Europe is &s;en&s;ible of this; every writer i meet with is either of my opinion, or ab&s;urdly and continually contradicts and confutes his own maintenance of the contrary in his own writings: i beg leave, to quote a very &s;en&s;ible Frenchman (who&s;e name I know not) on this &s;ubject, "it is true," &s;ays he, "that the free and happy &s;ituation of North-America, may much di&s;order our Eu|ropean &s;y&s;tems, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French word is <HI>Comb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ones European's,</HI> which may mean European alliances, combinations, or junctions, but I cannot find Engli&s;h &s;en&s;e in u&s;ing either, therefore I &s;uppo&s;e he means &s;y&s;tems, or he may have meant European plots which the word al&s;o bears.</NOTE> particularly, if the Engli&s;h colonies attain to the not paying impo&s;ed duties.

<P>To give my reader an idea of what room there is yet left for people to plant them&s;elves, i mu&s;t tell him, that between the latitudes of 31 to 46, which i judge to be the mo&s;t habitable country from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean, and which cannot fail by the cour&s;e of nature to become the country of tho&s;e Americans who were originally planted from England, Holland, and France, and emigrated from Germany, on, and to the &s;hores which bound the Atlantic we&s;tward, and who now generally &s;peak Engli&s;h; within the&s;e limits I &s;ay are contained no le&s;s than two thou&s;and one hundred and thirty-five millions, and forty thou&s;and &s;quare acres, ex|clu&s;ive of the known waters; at lea&s;t twice as much as the va&s;t empire of <HI>China</HI> is &s;aid to con|tain, and allowing each family to po&s;&s;e&s;s fifty acres of land, there is room for forty two millions, &s;even hundred and eight families to live here. To conclude this di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ettling of new provinces, i will ju&s;t ob&s;erve that the daily emigrations of the people beyond the frontiers, even at the ri&s;que of the dreadful &s;ituation of being expo&s;ed to &s;avage incur&s;ions, is the mo&s;t evident proof of the nece&s;&s;ity of this mea&s;ure to the at pre&s;ent crouded Americans, if not to Bri|tain.

Sudden and great alterations in the air, from intolerable heat, and chilling cold; this is per|ceived as &s;oon as the &s;un is &s;et, and for the mo&s;t part is accompanied with a very heavy dew, and &s;hews an unhealthy &s;wampy &s;oil; this is perfectly the ca&s;e on St. John's river, and about Na&s;&s;au-river, in Ea&s;t-Florida, likewi&s;e at Mobille, and Campbellton, in We&s;t-Florida. At Pen&s;acola, and from thence Ea&s;t: there is little or none of this perceivable; at Orleans, and on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi i was not &s;en&s;ible of any &s;udden alterations of this kind: and on enquiry found it not to be generally complained of.

His &s;econd &s;ign is, thick noi&s;ome fogs, ari&s;ing chiefly after &s;un-&s;et, from the vallies, and more particularly from the mud, &s;lime, and other im|purities; this i never perceived to a great degree in any part of the&s;e provinces; St. John's alone is very &s;ubject to thick na&s;ty fogs of all kinds, the &s;ea-&s;ide where &s;oft &s;alt mar&s;hes are frequent, is often troubled with the&s;e, and the&s;e mar&s;hes a little before rain emit a mo&s;t horrid, and to me a &s;uffocating &s;tench; the northern part of Ea&s;t-Florida is very full of the&s;e kind or mar&s;hes, in Georgia and Carolina they cover a prodigious &s;urface; the mar&s;hes in the &s;outh ea&s;t of Ea&s;t-Florida are of a different nature, and in We&s;t-Florida i remember very few of this kind; i have, however, never heard any thing &s;aid con|trary to a prevailing opinion of great &s;alu|brity in dwelling near, the &s;ea &s;ide, even among the thicke&s;t of the&s;e mar&s;hes; nor have i ever heard any notice taken of the above &s;tench by the inhabitants, except as being a certain in|dication of rain; where this kind of mar&s;hes are &s;ituate in bracki&s;h water, the &s;ituation is beyond doubt very unhealthy, the wan complexion and mi&s;erable mien of the generality of the inhabitants of &s;uch di&s;tricts too plainly evinces it- We know by experience, that all &s;uch fenny countries on every part of the earth labour under the &s;ame unhealthy calamity, but the comfort is, their areas are every where very &s;mall when compared

<P>The third is, uncommon &s;warms of flies, gnats, and other in&s;ects, which attend putrid air, and unhealthy places covered with wood; the fir&s;t of the&s;e is not common here, except at indigo works; and if the&s;e, according to my former caution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 139.</NOTE> be a little remote from the dwelling, I never &s;aw nor heard of any bad con&s;equences with regard to health attending them. I have already mentioned the bad effects of the&s;e voracious vermin on cattle of all kind at an indigo work; gnats, here called mu&s;quitos, are va&s;tly numerous in &s;ome &s;pots, but after we have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;tance the bracki&s;h waters in every river, they dimini&s;h, and at la&s;t we find none; the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi however is an ex|ception, but on this river they are not in &s;uch plenty at the fre&s;hes as below, at the <HI>rigolets,</HI> on pearl river, and at the <HI>Riviere aux Boeu&s;s,</HI> and on Dolphin-i&s;land, likewi&s;e in <HI>Santa-Ro&s;a</HI> bay, and in the bays of St. Andrews, St. Jo&s;ephs, and at St. George's &s;ound and i&s;lands, they are intollerable, and all the &s;ea coa&s;t of both provinces is exceed|ingly pe&s;tered with them.

or twelve days, beginning to abate its violence in general after the &s;eventh; the fourth or fifth is often fatal. I am per&s;uaded, that whenever the yellow fever has made its appearance in the Flo|ridas, it was imported from Jamaica or Havan|nah, as was the ca&s;e in 1765, which (by the way) was almo&s;t univer&s;ally an unhealthy <HI>Aera,</HI> as well in Europe as el&s;ewhere.

to &s;well, and a gha&s;tly palene&s;s &s;eized the face; afterwards, the fever abating, they vomited abundance of dark coloured blood; at this pe|riod they generally died, or within a few hours after the appearance of the&s;e &s;ymptoms. Tho&s;e who voided the above named and &s;ome blacker matter by &s;tool, emitted a terrible offen&s;ive &s;mell; but &s;ome of the&s;e were with difficulty cured; in the &s;ame manner it happened to tho&s;e, who &s;uffering of the fever, had, how|ever no evacuation; others were only &s;eized with a common bilious fever, and as much as i could judge, the major part of tho&s;e were young men, or middle aged, robu&s;t, and be|fore &s;ickne&s;s the bri&s;ke&s;t and mo&s;t cheerful; they had a heat about the <HI>praecordium,</HI> they vo|mited bile, or were making attempts to vomit and had an unquenchable thir&s;t; &s;ome of the&s;e frequently found them&s;elves cold, and by turns heats would &s;eize them; then &s;ucceeded a hot itching of the whole body, with a high, full, and quick pul&s;e; the tongue was yellowi&s;h or whiti&s;h- often encompa&s;&s;ed with a green border on the edges, and always wet or moi&s;t.</P>

<P>Blood drawn from the veins, in the heat of the fever; was bright red: it concreted and &s;epa|rated a yellow <HI>&s;erum,</HI> ju&s;t as in Europe.

<P>A worthy lad about eighteen years old, who found him&s;elf well in the morning early, was, about 10 o'clock of the &s;ame morning taken with a head ach, and other feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms, he had a high full and quick pul&s;e, he ob&s;ti|nately refu&s;ed being blooded: the &s;econd day at evening he voided abundance of dark di&s;co|loured blood by vomit, and the third he died.

<P>This is a very tedious di&s;ea&s;e, and whoever is afflicted with it &s;hould not too &s;oon judge him|&s;elf cured, but continue taking a bitter infu&s;ion, compo&s;ed of the bark of the root of the <HI>magnolia major</HI> (which the French on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;ub|&s;titute in lieu of Je&s;uit's bark) with Virginia heart, &s;nake-root, rue, <HI>&s;al ab&s;ynth:</HI> and pink root, in good Madeira or Li&s;bon wine.</P>

<P>An excellent thing to be given the negroes on a plantation before they go to work, is a wine gla&s;s full of the above bitter ingredients, and gar|lic infu&s;ed in rum; and they &s;hould be encouraged to chew and &s;moke tobacco.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on is &s;eized with a fit of the ague, he ought by no means to delay going to bed, and drink a draught of lime juice, and powder of chalk, while it is fermenting in the gla&s;s; this will bring on a &s;weat, and &s;horten the fit, or in the hot fit u&s;e &s;ome opiate if the patient is not delirious, this ought to be done as often as the paroxy&s;ms return.</P>
<P>The nervous fever, likewi&s;e called the &s;low fever, is known by a &s;mall, quick and low pul&s;e, and by not affecting the patient with &s;uch violent heats as the others fevers, but with greater op|pre&s;&s;ion about the <HI>praecordium;</HI> it does not make them &s;o thir&s;ty; the tongue is at fir&s;t unu&s;ually moi&s;t, and looks white, though at la&s;t it becomes dry, and looks brown or inflamed; continual heats are felt in the palms of the hands, heats and chills return alternately very quick, a copious clammy weakening &s;weat, exce&s;&s;ive lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, being drow&s;y without power of &s;leeping, pain and giddine&s;s of the head, ring|ing in the ears, and if it la&s;ts long, the tendons are often affected with a &s;ort of cramp; deafne&s;s,

Vomits are the remedy to which recour&s;e is mo&s;t u&s;ually had in this di&s;order.</P>
<P>Phy&s;icians &s;teadily, and almo&s;t totally avoid bleeding and purging, till after a free u&s;e of the <HI>Ipecacuana,</HI> and even then their cathartic pre&s;crip|tions are rarely any other than manna and &s;alts, and after the gentle purges obtained by this me|thod, they order a free u&s;e of rich chicken broth, and the above de&s;cribed juice of lemons &s;aturated with <HI>&s;al ab&s;ynth:</HI> this they generally continue un|til the di&s;ea&s;e changes into an intermittent fever, and then treat it in the manner la&s;t mentioned; frequently al&s;o applying bli&s;ters.</P>
<P>This fever more particularly than any other di&s;order, bears harde&s;t on the patient towards &s;un|&s;et. The diet commonly pre&s;cribed is &s;ago, chicken broth and panado, with &s;ome &s;mall mat|ter of wine and loaf &s;ugar in the fir&s;t and la&s;t;

<P>The pleuri&s;y al&s;o makes its appearance &s;ome|times in winter.

bleeding is not made u&s;e of as &s;oon as the patient is affected.

<P>A compound of the two la&s;t di&s;orders, called the <HI>Pleuro-peripneumony,</HI> is likewi&s;e &s;ometimes heard of, and is treated as the la&s;t.</P>
<P>In Georgia i &s;aw one or two in&s;tances of a di&s;|order among blacks, to which the people give the odd name of the pleuri&s;y of the temple, of the forehead, of the eye, and &s;o on; i am told they have a pleuri&s;y for every part of the head. It is violently acute, and, as i am informed, proves &s;ometimes fatal in ten or twelve hours time; if immediately on its attack, a quantity of blood is not drawn from the arm, for the re&s;t this di&s;ea&s;e is treated like a pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>The chronic di&s;ea&s;es are drop&s;ies, con&s;ump|tions, hemorrhoidal and habitual fluxes, relaxed and bilious habits of body, ruptures, worm-fevers, and among blacks the lepro&s;y, elephan|tia&s;is and body yaws; which la&s;t in Carolina is called the lame di&s;temper; the fir&s;t five of the&s;e are often be&s;t removed by a change of air, as the mo&s;t efficacious medicines often prove of no u&s;e again&s;t the ob&s;tinacy of the di&s;orders in the climate where they fir&s;t originated.</P>

A con&s;umptive habit of body. particularly where the cough is very ob&s;tinate and frequent, and when bilious &s;tools, with a great hardne&s;s of the lower belly affect the patient, or when a continual fever emaciates the poor &s;ufferer, he is in a dangerous way, and a remove to colder climates is hardly advi&s;eable; i have known &s;uch people relieved by making frequent &s;hort voyages to &s;ea in moderate cli|mates; but unle&s;s proper remedies are al&s;o made u&s;e of during the&s;e voyages, the fever returns almo&s;t directly on relanding; frequently after one or two of the&s;e voyages the patient feels him|&s;elf better; if he then retires to a milk diet, and freely indulges him&s;elf in fruits, utterly avoiding all manner of drugs or medicines, he may find relief, and even a return of con&s;titution; fre|quent do&s;es of flour of brim&s;tone, and cooling the water he drinks with &s;al nitre, are of u&s;e during this cour&s;e: likewi&s;e the patient ought with the greate&s;t care to avoid exerci&s;e; the &s;tiller he keeps him&s;elf the more hopes of recovery there is.

<P>The river St. Mary is the northernmo&s;t boundary of Ea&s;t Florida and by the Spaniards called Rio <HI>Santa Cecilia,</HI> and by the &s;avages <HI>Thlathla Tla|kuphka,</HI> and is de&s;cribed in page 36; the &s;oil here is not very fertile, unle&s;s it be at its very head, which reaches up to near the head of flint river, which la&s;t runs into the river <HI>Apalachicola,</HI> and this being the we&s;tern bounds of this province, we may in the pre&s;ent undetermined &s;tate of the&s;e matters regard as the mo&s;t natural limits of the province on the land &s;ide; from St. Mary's river's mouth there is a di&s;tance of fourteen miles along the beach of <HI>Amelia</HI> i&s;land to the mouth of Na&s;&s;au

<P>The town has by all writers till Dr. Stork's time been &s;aid to lay at the foot of a hill; &s;o far from truth is this, that it is almo&s;t &s;urrounded by water, and the remains of the line drawn from the harbour to St. Seba&s;tian's creek, a quarter of a mile to the north of the fort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m which line &s;tands a fortified gate called the barrier gate, is the only ri&s;ing ground near it; this line had a ditch, and its fortification was pretty regular; about a mile and a half beyond this are the re|mains of another fortified line, which had a kind of look out or advanced guard of &s;toccadoes at its we&s;tern extremity on St. Seba&s;tian's creek; and fort Mo&s;&s;a at its ea&s;t end; be&s;ides the&s;e the town has been fortified with a &s;light but regular line of circumvallation and a ditch. The town is half a mile in length and its &s;outhern line had two ba&s;tions of &s;tone, one of which (if not both) are broken down, and the materials u&s;ed for the
<PB N="263" REF="014440_0282_0F92634EAD278260">
building of the foundation of the barracks; the ditch and parapet are planted with a &s;pecies of agave, which by its points is well fitted to keep cattle out, and with that intention was u&s;ed by the Spaniards for fences. Dr. Stork has rai&s;ed this fence into a fortification again&s;t the &s;avages and magnified it into <HI>Chevaux de frize.</HI> The town is very ill built, the &s;treets being all except one crooked and narrow. The date on one of the hou&s;es i remember to be 1571; the&s;e are of &s;tone, mo&s;tly flat roofed, heavy and look badly. Till the arrival of the Engli&s;h neither gla&s;s windows nor chimneys were known here, the lower windows had all a projecting frame of wooden rails before them. On the 3d of January 1766, a fro&s;t de&s;troyed all the tropical productions in the country except the oranges; the Spaniards called this a judgement on the place, for being become the property of Hereticks, as they never had experienced the like. The Governor's hou&s;e is a heavy un&s;ightly pile, but well contrived for the climate; at its north we&s;t &s;ide it has a kind of tower to the height of which Governor Grant has added &s;everal feet; this &s;erves as a look out. There were three &s;uburbs in the time of the Span|iards, but all de&s;troyed before my acquaintance with the place, except the church of the indian town to the north now converted into an ho&s;pital; (Dr. Stork &s;ays the &s;teeple of this church is of good workman&s;hip though built by the indians, neither of which a&s;&s;ertions is true,) and the &s;teeple of the German chapel to the we&s;t of the town like|wi&s;e remains. The pari&s;h church in the town is a wretched building and now almo&s;t a heap of ruins; the parade before the Governor's hou&s;e is nearly

A letter from a friend, who lately returned from England, directed to me, dated 2 th May 1774, &s;ays, <Q>this town is now truly become a heap of ruins, a fit receptacle for the wretches of inhabitants.</Q></P>
<P>About eight miles north of the town is a tract of a con&s;iderable &s;ize, called the twelve mile &s;wamp; which i take to be equal in goodne&s;s to any in America; this began to be cultivated in the year 1770. Three miles we&s;t from the town is another &s;mall tract of tolerable land, called the three mile &s;wamp; all be&s;ides this within many miles is really a mi&s;erable &s;and, a dreary &s;crub ground, and boggy &s;alt mar&s;h, a few acres at the head of St. Seba&s;tian's only excepted.</P>

made by him, unle&s;s the government afterwards gave a grant, but this was one of the many ways to make offices worthy of holding; the above named gentleman has a pretty retreat on this i&s;land, about four miles from town; but as the land is barren it is more plea&s;ant than profitable. The &s;ound which divides this i&s;land from the main, is called <HI>Matauca</HI> river, it is about twenty miles in length; the i&s;land affords pa&s;turage for numerous herds of hor&s;es and &s;ome cattle, the fir&s;t in par|ticular breed kindly here; about half a mile from the north end of the i&s;land is a heavy &s;tone build|ing &s;erving for a look out; a &s;mall detachment of troops is kept here, and by &s;ignals from hence, the inhabitants are given to under&s;tand what kind of, and how many ve&s;&s;els are approaching the harbour, either from the north or from the &s;outh; in the year 1770 fifty feet of timber frame work was added to its former height, as was likewi&s;e a ma&s;t or flag&s;taff forty &s;even feet long, but this la&s;t proving too weighty, endangered the build|ing and was &s;oon taken down. In this i&s;land are quarries of a kind of concreted petrified &s;hells, or a &s;tone bearing their re&s;emblance, this will be de|&s;cribed hereafter.</P>
<P>About two miles &s;outh of the town is the mouth of St. Seba&s;tian's river already mentioned, this is a &s;mall creek ri&s;ing near &s;ix miles north of the town, but its &s;tream &s;oon becomes &s;alt by the meeting of the waters from below; ve&s;&s;els go two miles and a half up it to clean. A bridge was built over it to the we&s;t of the town, which &s;hort|ened the road into the country near &s;even miles, but the great depth of the water joined to the in|&s;tability of the bottom did not &s;uffer it to remain

<P>We next meet the mouth of St. Nicholas creek, on the point to the north of which the fir&s;t town was built by the Spaniards, but they &s;oon re|moved it for conveniency's &s;ake to its pre&s;ent &s;ite: on the &s;outh point is a plantation belonging to Mr. <HI>Moultrie</HI> the pre&s;ent Lieutenant Governor; this place is remarkable for a large oy&s;ter bank being entirely eat out by this gentleman's negroes in a &s;carce &s;ea&s;on.

<P>Six miles further &s;outh, or about ten miles from town is the mouth of <HI>Sta. Cecilia,</HI> another &s;mall river of little note. Between nine and ten miles further is the look out or fort of <HI>Matanca,</HI> on a mar&s;hy i&s;land, commanding the entrance of <HI>Matanca,</HI> which lays oppo&s;ite to it; this fort is to be &s;een at the di&s;tance of about five leagues, it is of very little &s;trength, nor need it be otherwi&s;e, as there is &s;carce eight feet water at the be&s;t of times on this bar: the Spaniards kept a Lieuten|ant's command here; the Engli&s;h a Serjeant's. Between two or three miles from this inlet or bar is another of &s;till le&s;s note, called <HI>el Penon;</HI> oppo|&s;ite and &s;outhward is the mouth of a river called <HI>North We&s;t,</HI> i &s;uppo&s;e from the direction of the cour&s;e we go up it; it is &s;omewhat more con&s;ider|able than the two or three la&s;t mentioned; &s;ome &s;ettlements are near its banks, but of &s;mall im|portance, the land being in general arid and poor.

We frequently meet with &s;pacious &s;avannahs of the high kind; the country is co|vered with roe deer and turkies, the lakes &s;tocked with fi&s;h, and thus it continues in a due we&s;t line acro&s;s the Mexican gulph to the &s;aid latitude 28, which &s;trikes &s;aid gulph 15 m. northward of the bay of <HI>Spiritu Santo.</HI> As we go northerly the fertile &s;pots become more frequent, till we come to that part of the province formerly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards: here we find along the

We next met with very great holes, fifty or &s;ixty feet deep, and thirty or forty feet in diameter at the &s;urface, in the highe&s;t part of the pine ridges, which af|ford &s;ome good water to the thir&s;ty traveller, there being no other water in tho&s;e ridges.

My guide informed me, that in the road from <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> to <HI>Apalachia,</HI> in a &s;imilar

<P>On the 10th of June, 1771, i found my&s;elf in a di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, on the we&s;t cour&s;e of Ea&s;t-Florida, through want of water; I &s;aw fre|quently very &s;trong currents of di&s;coloured water, indicating fre&s;h &s;treams; &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e to pro|ceed from rivers, i coa&s;ted along &s;hore; but found nothing except innumerable i&s;lands and va&s;t &s;hoals; frequently ta&s;ting the water, found it always bracki&s;h: at length, on the 21&s;t day of &s;aid month, i found an opening, where I got an|chorage for my ve&s;&s;el. I went per&s;onally on &s;hore, to explore the &s;mall i&s;land we were next to, taking with me a lad, and a thirty gallon ca&s;k. Its a&s;pect was mi&s;erable; oy&s;ter &s;hells and rocks were every where its &s;uperficies; at la&s;t, however, I found a &s;mall hole in the rock, and water in it; which, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible joy proved
<PB N="277" REF="014440_0296_0F9261CFACE1AF60">
fre&s;h, and of the cleare&s;t and fine&s;t kind; ha&s;ten|ing back on board, we were obliged to roll the ca&s;k in the water, in order to get it into the boat, when, accidentally applying my hand to my mouth, i found to my &s;urprize the water to be fre&s;h; having proceeded on board, we ta&s;ted the water in which the ve&s;&s;el &s;wam, which al&s;o prov|ed fre&s;h and good: thus i found, my&s;elf, as it were, in a &s;ea of fre&s;h water; &s;timulated by cu|rio&s;ity, i left the ve&s;&s;el next day, with an inten|tion to penetrate to the main land, which, with difficulty was effected; but in a whole day's &s;earch no river was found; yet a con&s;tant &s;trong current proceeded from the &s;hore, and along it. The &s;ingularity of the circum&s;tance made me beat the ground, and &s;tamp on it, which occa&s;ioned a hollow &s;ound. I have &s;ince been informed by travellers, that between the town <HI>St. Mattheo,</HI> (now inhabited by &s;avages, and &s;ituate on the ri|ver <HI>St. Juan de Guacaro</HI>) and <HI>Apalachia,</HI> they fre|quently meet with this hollow &s;ound under their hor&s;es feet. Twenty miles ea&s;t from <HI>Apalachia,</HI> we cro&s;s a place over a creek, called by the &s;a|vages, the natural bridge: all the&s;e circum&s;tances corre&s;pond with an idea which I have formed of &s;ubterraneous rivers in this province. Another curio&s;ity, though not a natural one, are the marks of former improvement of this country; particularly the ve&s;tiges of the regular maize hills (even in woods where, &s;ince the aera of culture, trees of twelve to eighteen inches dia|meter have grown up) and the nails and &s;pikes drove into &s;ome very large trees, apparently at ancient Spani&s;h Cowpens; add to the&s;e, the re|liques of old fences, huts, hou&s;es and churches,

particularly a church bell in the fields, at <HI>Santa F&eacute;.</HI> Thus we have a melancholy in&s;tance, even in this new world, of the depredations of time, and a country once nobly and exten&s;ively &s;ettled, through the inroads of the &s;avages reduced again to a wilderne&s;s, yet all this mu&s;t have happened &s;ome time later than Anno Domini 1543, the year when <HI>Soto</HI> compleated the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian expedition to Florida, with his death.</P>

I al&s;o regard as a cu|rio&s;ity of the artificial kind, the immen&s;e orange groves, found in the woods between latitude 28&frac12;, and 30&deg;, &s;uppo&s;ing them originally &s;prung from the &s;eeds of &s;ome oranges formerly dropt, by tra|velling Spaniards, at their camps, but which are now gradually decaying, by rea&s;on of the wan|tonne&s;s of our traders and hunters, who, when in want of the fruit, cut down the tree; other ve|getable curio&s;ities will more probably appear un|der the botanical heads. The many <HI>Tumuli,</HI> ori|ginally intended for the peaceful repo&s;itory of the dead, tho' &s;ome of their tops now bear &s;ummer hou&s;es for recreation to the living, are another cu|rio&s;ity.

The town lies near the N.

The &s;and be|fore this entrance, is a fine white quick&s;and, of a particular nature. I have anchored &s;everal times within the di&s;tance of three or four leagues from this mouth, but not above once or twice without having the cable all eaten through, in the ring of the anchor; &s;ometimes i have purcha&s;ed the anchor by a &s;ingle &s;trand, &s;ometimes by le&s;s, at other times by a little more; and i have lo&s;t above &s;ix or &s;even anchors, and large grapnels at this place, yet there is nowhere any foul ground, or, in other words, no rocky bottom. At a mile, or more, from the &s;hore, and within that di&s;tance, i think, i have found a few &s;hell &s;tones, I imagine that this fine quick&s;and, being very &s;harp, by its continual motion chafes and frets the cable quite through, and this, it generally does, in le&s;s than four and twenty hours.</P>
<P>From this mouth of the lagoon an i&s;land &s;tretches to about the latitude 26, 55, where there is another mouth, or inlet, caled <HI>Hob&eacute;</HI> by the Spa|niards; this i&s;land is thirty-nine mea&s;ured &s;tatute miles long: at twenty-four miles from its north|end are &s;everal high cliffs of a blue &s;tone; the&s;e are the fir&s;t rocks that lie high out of the water, along the American beach; they are placed at about high water mark, and a &s;mall ridge, or reef, runs &s;loping off from the northernmo&s;t one:

and about nine miles further, towards <HI>Hob&eacute;</HI> is an|other parcel; as there is likewi&s;e at the entrance of <HI>Hob&eacute;,</HI> of very &s;olid, hard rock; all which, particularly the northernmo&s;t ones, are excellent landmarks for the &s;eamen, going &s;outhwards. The remarkable things about this i&s;land are, that it is a narrow &s;lip of beach, and mangrove land; on the beach are always great numbers of pieces of Spani&s;h cedar; originally cut on the windward rivers of Cuba, for the u&s;e of the <HI>Catholic</HI> King's &s;hip-yards; but by land floods drove into the Ba|hama channel, and Gulph &s;tream, whence the frequent ea&s;t-winds force them upon foundings, and &s;o on this beach; very few pieces are found either north or &s;outh of this i&s;land. The i&s;land on its we&s;t-&s;ide is indented, almo&s;t regularly into points and bays. Fre&s;h water may be obtained by digging in almo&s;t every part of the beach.

of this plenty is, in my opinion, that this tract is &s;carcely ever invaded by the ho&s;tile &s;avages, or yet more de&s;tructive white hunter; this is the river, which, as i was told by a Spani&s;h pilot and fi&s;herman of good credit, proceeds from the lake <HI>Mayacco,</HI> a lake of &s;eventy-five miles in circum|ference by his account. The man told me that he had formerly been taken by the &s;avages, and by them carried a pri&s;oner, in a canoe, by way of this river, to their &s;ettlements on the banks of the lake; he &s;ays, that at the di&s;emboguing of the river, out of the lake, lies a &s;mall cedar i&s;land; he al&s;o told me that he &s;aw the mouth of five or &s;ix rivers, but whether falling out of, or into the lake, i could not learn of him; probably &s;ome of the many rivers i cro&s;&s;ed in my journey acro&s;s this penin&s;ula, fall into it, and it is not improbable that St. John's river originates in it. The large river in Charlotte harbour, by the di|rection of its cour&s;e, meridian &s;ituation, and great width, i judge, might, perhaps, &s;pring from the &s;ame fountain; however, the &s;avages of <HI>Taloffo Ocha&s;&eacute;</HI> told me, that in going far &s;outh, they go round a large water, emptying it&s;elf into the we&s;t &s;ea, i. e. gulph of <HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much have i been able to learn of this water, the exploring of which i always intended; whether there is really this lake, or not, i will not be po&s;itive, but the above circum&s;tances, joined to a dark account, which the &s;avages give of going up St. John's, and coming down an|other river, to go into &s;ome far &s;outhern region of Ea&s;t Florida (on which account the name of <HI>Ylacco,</HI> and the name given to <HI>St. Lucia</HI> by the &s;avages, both conveying indecent meanings, are

That there is &s;ome &s;uch great water, is fur|ther to be gathered from the profu&s;ion of fre&s;h water which this river, <HI>St. Lucia,</HI> pours down.

it is much like Georgia, and the north part of Ea&s;t Florida.</P>
<P>Pen&s;acola has about an hundred and eighty hou&s;es in it, built in general in a good ta&s;te, but of timber: the town is laid out in an oblong &s;quare, near the foot of an hill, called <HI>Gage-hill;</HI> and by means of two rivulets of excellent water, which almo&s;t &s;urround it, is the be&s;t watered of any i know on the continent. The harbour is &s;pacious, and here are three con&s;iderable rivers, viz. <HI>E&s;camb&eacute;, Che&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Middle</HI> rivers, be&s;ides &s;everal lagoons and rivulets of no note. <HI>Che&s;ter-river</HI> is full of i&s;lands, great and &s;mall, abound|ing principally with the <HI>Cupre&s;&s;us Thyoides. Middle-river</HI> communicates with &s;everal lakes; the water of this river is &s;o cold, that the &s;avages call it <HI>Weewa Ca&s;upka,</HI> which in the Creek language &s;ignifies cold water. The <HI>E&s;camb&eacute;</HI> is navigable a con&s;iderable way up, but rapid, and about twen|ty miles from Pen&s;acola we begin to meet with &s;ome &s;pots of fertile land, variou&s;ly timbered. Twenty-eight miles from the town, and on the banks of this river, on an eminence, are the re|mains of a Spani&s;h out-guard, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ocado fort; about &s;eventy-eight miles from town, this river forks, a branch called <HI>Weewa Oka,</HI> or <HI>Weeoka,</HI> by us little <HI>Scamb&eacute;,</HI> coming from the N.

Fourteen miles farther we&s;t from Pen|&s;acola, is the <HI>Rio Perdido,</HI> or lo&s;t river, of incon|&s;iderable

All the coun|try between this la&s;t river and <HI>Che&s;ter-river,</HI> and probably all to <HI>Apalachicola</HI> is very favourable for &s;tocks of cattle; many noble cane branches, mixed in the pine land, affording them excellent food, and they multiply very rapidly. Lovers of minute geography, by examining my maps, will find that the lower part of the coa&s;t between <HI>Mobile</HI> bay and <HI>Perdido,</HI> and &s;o on to <HI>Pen&s;acola,</HI> may ea&s;ily be made navigable for boats in land, there being already a rolling road out of the ri|ver <HI>Ben &s;ecour,</HI> into a creek running into <HI>Perdido;</HI> but this being mere matter of &s;peculation we mu&s;t leave the practical part to &s;ome future ge|neration. The country we&s;t from <HI>Mobile</HI> bay, to <HI>Nita Albany,</HI> or Bean-camp, at lake <HI>Maurepas,</HI> is much of the &s;ame kind as that already de&s;cribed; only we find more fertile planting ground in it. The timber here is nearly the &s;ame as in the north part of Ea&s;t-Florida; but it is worthy of remark, that not one of the <HI>Bora&s;&s;us,</HI> or Cabbage tree, is found along this whole extent from <HI>Apalachia</HI> we&s;tward; which does not agree well with a re|port in a letter to a certain <HI>George Lookup,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in <HI>Robin&s;on</HI>'s hi&s;tory of <HI>Florida,</HI> where he &s;ays, that the cabbage trees along this coa&s;t, rear their lofty heads above all others; but &s;o curious a piece as this pamphlet is ought not to be ran|&s;aked, i will therefore proceed to give &s;ome ex|tracts from my journals through the we&s;tern parts of We&s;t Florida, as being the be&s;t way to give my reader a true idea of this country.</P>

The weather being &s;evere|ly cold i was obliged to go on &s;hore and make a fire, on this highland, half a mile below the above river, near the mouth of a &s;tony creek, which we took to be the <HI>Sonac Tocal&egrave;,</HI> which we had cro&s;&s;ed in the road going up; here we re|mained till noon. We pa&s;&s;ed three i&s;lands this day, and the general run of the land is midd|ling high on both &s;ides. The weather was very &s;evere, which obliged us to encamp at one o'clock,

in the mouth of a creek, called Old Town Creek, at the foot of an hill, ri&s;ing about &s;eventy feet out of the water, having come about &s;even miles: it rained very hard all the afternoon, and the next two days, by which means we kept in camp till the</P>
<P N="20">20th, at noon. Half a mile from our camp the high land ends, and we travelled but one hour and twenty minutes, when the &s;everity of the weather obliged us again to encamp, having come &s;ix miles, and in that di&s;tance found chiefly low land: pa&s;t four i&s;lands, and as many rapids, one of them a bad pa&s;s: our camp was on a piece of fine rich, middling high land, which Mr. <HI>Dew</HI> reported to be very exten&s;ive. We lay here on account of bad weather; &s;uch as cold, rain and &s;now, till the</P>
<P N="26">26th, when at a little pa&s;t twelve we departed. During our &s;tay here the water gained near four feet in height: in one hour and an half, hav|ing gone near five miles, and pa&s;t &s;ix or &s;even i&s;lands and rapids, we were at the mouth of the river <HI>Oca Tibehaw,</HI> the lower road between the <HI>Choct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws</HI> and <HI>Chica&s;aws;</HI>&mdash;cro&s;&s;ed this river about two miles above this place;&mdash;about one mile below this, having pa&s;t an i&s;land, we &s;aw a very remarkable bluff on the we&s;t &s;ide, ri&s;ing above fifty feet out of the pre&s;ent level of the water; this is near a mile and a half long; the bluff is covered principally with <HI>Juniper,</HI> or ce|dar &s;hrubs, and in it are two or three gullies, in which as many &s;prings come trickling down for about two thirds of its length: a bank projects out at its foot, having a flat and very even &s;ur|face, without any plants, (a little gra&s;s excepted)
<PB N="320" REF="014440_0339_0F92620AF6FBD9F8">
growing thereon. This &s;urface projects about nine or ten feet from the bluff into the river, and was about eight feet above the level of the wa|ter, it looks as if made by art, and if placed near any town of note, i do not doubt would be much u&s;ed as a walk. The bluff ends in two little hills, and a &s;mall i&s;land is at the lower end of it; all which, added to its being in the form of a cre&s;|cent, makes it have a very romantic appearance. From hence we went pa&s;t one more bluff, a con|&s;iderable i&s;land, and a rapid; in which la&s;t we had low pine land on the ea&s;t bank, and got into the mouth of a creek, called eleven mile creek, which we went up half a mile, and at three P. M. we were forced by the rain to come to camp, having travelled this day, ten miles and a half.</P>
<P N="27">27th. The rain obliged us to lay by all day.</P>
<P N="28">28th. At 11 o'clock we embarked, and had more rapids to go thro' than on any of the former days; likewi&s;e &s;aw more high land than before. I think it remarkable, that we &s;ee &s;o very few outwaterings of creeks, or rivers, into the great river. An hour and an half after leaving camp we &s;aw a bark log, ju&s;t landed on the we&s;t &s;ide, and evident marks of people having ju&s;t landed; this was in a long reach, and we had &s;een a &s;moak, but when we came near the bark log, the &s;moak vani&s;hed all at once. We &s;oon found the&s;e people to be a war party of Creeks, who perceiving our boat, had put out their fire, which on the&s;e occa&s;ions they make of hickory bark and other oily matters, that yield little &s;moak. We there|fore put on our hats, which we had not on be|fore, it being a fine agreeable day, and rather warm, and laying on the paddles, did all we

could to &s;hew that we were white people. It was fortunate for me that i had not brought a &s;avage guide with me, which would have expo&s;ed us to a volley from tho&s;e warriors; we did not &s;ee them, but we knew by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;moak, that they had di&s;covered us; they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndoubtedly on the top of a pretty high bank, in ambu&s;h, &s;o we let the boat flow pa&s;t them. N. B. We have di&s;covered many of tho&s;e bark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs, made of cones, both above and below this place, upon which the war party ferry over. Half a mile lower down we &s;aw the mouth of a middling large creek, on the ea&s;t &s;ide. We pa&s;t four i&s;lands this day, in two hours and an half's time. We &s;aw one of the high &s;avannahs, which bounds here on the river, with a delightful gra&s;&s;y bluff: the river is here above two hundred feet wide. Having come twenty three miles, we en|camped at four o'clock, on a gravel bar. We &s;aw many places that appeared like old fields, as having been formerly cultivated.</P>
<P N="29">29th. At nine o'clock proceeded; the fir&s;t half hour we pa&s;&s;ed chiefly through drowned lands, and then came to a large lagoon, going to N. W. in which were innumerable gee&s;e and ducks; but the we&s;t bank of the lagoon is a hand&s;ome bluff. In half an hour more we came to a creek's mouth on the we&s;t: we &s;aw again &s;ome &s;pots bearing marks of former cultivation, and more of drowned land; the river in general this day rapid, with many i&s;lands: at half an hour pa&s;t three, P. M. having travelled thirty-five miles, we encamped on the ea&s;t &s;ide, in a lagoon, on a high bank, where, for the fir&s;t time, we &s;aw the rich ground clear of large canes;

this being timbered, chiefly with the &s;hag b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hickory, iron wood and Spani&s;h oak.</P>
<P N="30">30th. This morning we had our boat loaden, but it began to rain, and thus were obliged to unload again. Here we found a canoe which was well made, but had been by the &s;avages, on account of the war, &s;cuttled, and rendered unfit for u&s;e, however we found, that if we could make her any ways tight, &s;he would be more &s;afe than the one we had, and this we effected by the help of wedges, clay and leather. Our provi&s;ions beginning to grow &s;cant, and having lo&s;t the on|ly gun i had taken with me, i began to be un|ea&s;y, e&s;pecially as we found the beavers become le&s;s plenty. This weather was uncommonly bad till the evening of the third of January, 1772, when it cleared up, and next morning</P>
<P>4th January, 1772, at a quarter before 11 o' clock, A. M. we proceeded in our new craft&punc; and by half an hour pa&s;t one, P. M. we had pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> high banks, and two i&s;lands: at this hour we had one of the &s;avannahs on the we&s;t &s;ide, the bank being here about four feet out of the water: at a quarter before four we were at a con&s;iderable i&s;land, having gone &s;ince the la&s;t &s;avannah bet|ween low banks; a quarter before five o'clock came to camp under a low bluff, on the ea&s;t &s;ide. The canoe proves very leaky, and on unloading we find a great deal of our bread &s;poiled. This day came twenty-two miles and an half, the canes and timber are here exceeding large.</P>
<P N="5">5th. At a quarter pa&s;t ten embarked: high banks on both &s;ides. At half an hour after eleven, pa&s;t the mouth of a river from the ea&s;t; this is called by the &s;avages <HI>Na&s;hebaw.</HI> The
<PB N="323" REF="014440_0342_0F92620D02F2B708">
and here is exceeding rich, the canes very large, and we &s;aw a &s;pecies of <HI>pha&s;eolus,</HI> in great abun|dance, along the banks. About a mile and a quarter below the creek, we met four &s;avages from <HI>Abeka,</HI> in the <HI>Chactaw</HI> nation, to whom Mr. <HI>Dow</HI> was known. The river has ri&s;en con|&s;iderably &s;ince ye&s;terday; the current has been for the&s;e two days almo&s;t uniformly at the rate of three miles per hour. It is remarkable, that though the velocity of our way was not much above two miles per hour, independent of the current, yet we had &s;everal in&s;tances of having evidently out-run the flood at night, in &s;o much that it would &s;carce reach us again before morn|ing. We came to camp near the &s;avages above|mentioned, having come &s;even miles and an half; they had a good canoe which i intended to pur|cha&s;e. The weather was very cold to day. Lo&s;t a &s;ilver &s;poon at our la&s;t camp, which Mr. <HI>Dow</HI> propo&s;ed to go and fetch; but he found it im|practicable to cro&s;s the <HI>Na&s;hehaw</HI> river. I agreed with the &s;avages that they &s;hould hunt for us to procure provi&s;ions. At night it rained; our camp was on the ea&s;t &s;ide, in a very rich &s;pot. We have not yet &s;een any &s;and or gravel, except on the bars and i&s;lands in the river, the &s;oil in general being clay, or loam, with a dry black mould.</P>
<P N="6">6th. After a great deal of per&s;ua&s;ion, i bought the canoe from the &s;avages; and they brought me in two deer, and a turkey; for all which i gave them five yards of blue &s;trouds, two pow|der horns, a knife, and &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot. I de|&s;cribed our la&s;t camp to them, and de&s;ired them to look for the abovementioned &s;poon, directing
<PB N="324" REF="014440_0343_0F92620DAF8EF8F8">
them to leave it in their own country, with Mr. <HI>Dow</HI>'s partner, who lived ju&s;t by their homes, and gave them a note to him, de&s;iring him to pay them for their trouble; but when they under|&s;tood it to be the <HI>white &s;tone</HI> (i. e.) &s;ilver, they declined going purpo&s;ely for it; but promi&s;ed, if chance led them to the place to carry it as di|rected, for they, not being able to work it, in ca&s;e the trader refu&s;ed to pay them, they would lo&s;e their labour; but had it been <HI>the fat of the earth</HI> (i. e.) lead or pewter, in that ca&s;e they might make bullets, or ear-rings of it, and then they would not take pains in vain: towards even|ing they left us, and during night we barbecued our veni&s;on, to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P N="7">7th. At half an hour pa&s;t &s;even o'clock A. M. embarked in our new craft; all day we pa&s;t be|tween high banks, &s;ome &s;teep, &s;ome &s;loping; &s;e|veral as high as eighty feet above the &s;urface of the water; one of the&s;e has an exten&s;ive &s;avan|nah on the top. At the end of nineteen miles and an half, on the we&s;t &s;ide, we &s;aw the mouth of the river <HI>Nox&s;hubby,</HI> or <HI>Hatcha oo&s;e,</HI> its banks are high on both &s;ides: here &s;eems to be the true theatre of the war, for the bark logs are very numerous. The river is widened now from two hundred to two hundred and fifty feet. A mile and a half below the mouth of <HI>Nox&s;hubby</HI> is the fir&s;t bluff of arid ochre, like earth, very high and &s;teep; and about eight miles lower a white one, being a kind of &s;tone almo&s;t as &s;oft as chalk. Towards evening we met with &s;everal &s;and bars, and little i&s;les. At four o'clock P. M. we came to camp on a low &s;pot, on the ea&s;t-&s;ide, having gone done the river forty-two miles
<PB N="325" REF="014440_0344_0F92620F97375048">
and a half; all day dull weather, and at night rain.</P>
<P N="8">8th. Proceeded half an hour after 8 A. M. and having gone a little more than a mile, we reached the mouth of the creek called <HI>Ectombogue b&eacute;</HI> (i. e.) Crooked Creek, on the we&s;t &s;ide; from this creek's name the French derive their <HI>Tombechb&eacute;,</HI> the name of the fort which &s;tood here, and which has again given that name to the whole river. We went about half a mile further down, under a high and &s;teep bank of chalky &s;tone, and ar|rived at the ruins of the fort, by means of which the French kept all the &s;avages in awe. I went a&s;hore in the old fields, and drew a view of the ruins; this is about forty miles ea&s;t from the town of <HI>Abeeka.</HI> The river is not &s;ixty feet wide here. About a mile and a half below the&s;e ruins is a pretty high, but &s;loping &s;laty bluff: having come about nine miles, we arrived at a hunting camp of <HI>Chactaws,</HI> on the we&s;t &s;ide; who invited us on &s;hore, treated us very kindly, and &s;pared us &s;ome veni&s;on, bear's meat and oil. The af|ternoon being &s;tormy, with hail and rain, we en|camped at a &s;mall di&s;tance from them: the canes were not very plenty here, but the land rich: a great deal of the plant called <HI>Indian Hemp</HI> grows in this place; but the &s;ea&s;on deprived me of the &s;atisfaction of knowing what genus it is of.</P>
<P N="9">9th. At half an hour pa&s;t eleven proceeded, and in an hour and a quarter we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Chic|kianoe&eacute;,</HI> a white bluff, with a &s;avannah on its top, on the we&s;t &s;ide; it is upwards of &s;eventy feet high above the water's level: we pa&s;t &s;everal high bluffs, among which one is yellow like <HI>Ochre.</HI> We &s;aw many bars al&s;o, and lagoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="326" REF="014440_0345_0F92620FF0463720">
having travelled twenty-four miles, came to camp at four o'clock P. M. on the ea&s;t &s;ide, at the beginning of a &s;teep &s;laty bluff.</P>
<P N="10">10th. At half an hour pa&s;t nine, A. M. pro|ceeded; we went between high bluffs, and in two hours time came to the mouth of <HI>Tu&s;caloo&s;a</HI> river from the ea&s;t; and a little below it is the &s;teep white chalky bluff, on who&s;e top is a va&s;t plain, and &s;ome remains of huts in it, the bluff is called the <HI>Chica&s;ow Gallery,</HI> becau&s;e from here the &s;avages u&s;ed to annoy the French boats go|ing up to the fort, or down from it. The river is hereabouts full of rapids, and bad pa&s;&s;es: we came pa&s;t a number of high bluffs, mo&s;t of them chalky. At half an hour pa&s;t three we pa&s;t the mouth of <HI>Sookhanatcha</HI> from the we&s;t, and three miles below it came to camp, at four o'clock P. M. at the foot of the hill, where formerly the <HI>Coo&s;adas</HI> were &s;ettled: this place is called <HI>Sukta|loo&s;a</HI> (i. e.) Black Bluff, from its being a kind of coal; it is a great thorough-fare for warring &s;avages, therefore we took the u&s;ual precaution of large fires, and hanging our hats on &s;takes, which we had rea&s;on to think not in vain; for in the night we heard the report of &s;mall arms. This day we came thirty-&s;ix miles. It is worthy of remark, that although we have come ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eventy miles from the ruins of <HI>Tombechb&eacute;,</HI> yet by land the di&s;tance is not above twenty-four, or twenty-five miles. The land here is very fine, and Mr. <HI>Dow</HI> told me, that he had lived here with the <HI>Coo&s;adas,</HI> and that the common yield of corn was from &s;ixty to eighty bu&s;hels per acre; that they increa&s;ed hor&s;es and hogs to any degree
<PB N="327" REF="014440_0346_0F926210BA3AC8B8">
they plea&s;ed, and that veni&s;on, turkies and fi&s;h were uncommonly plenty.</P>
<P N="11">11th. La&s;t night and this morning, being rai|ny, we could not proceed till eleven o'clock. All this day we pa&s;&s;ed through the remains of the <HI>Coo&s;ada</HI> and <HI>Occhoy</HI> &s;ettlements, being all a fine tract of ground, of which much had been cleared; but it is now again overgrown with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeds; the grand, or publick plantation in par|ticular is an excellent tract. At four o'clock P.

<P N="12">12th. At half an hour pa&s;t eight A. M. pro|ceeded. All this day we &s;aw marks of great fer|tility of &s;oil, and much tolerably high land: at half an hour pa&s;t ten, we were at a creek called <HI>Abe&s;ha&iuml;,</HI> at a quarter pa&s;t eleven at the la&s;t <HI>Occhoy</HI> field, by a creek called <HI>Ba&s;hailawaw;</HI> at eleven A.

are red, others grey. Here we were overtaken by very bad weather, from which took &s;helter; at half an hour pa&s;t one, P. M. we encamped about three quarters of a mile below the hill, on the &s;lope of a pretty high bank, where we found the remains of a camp, that had been occupied lately by white people; we came about eleven miles and an half this day; the rain continued till two o'clock A. M. next day, when the wind &s;hifting to W. N. W, it grew exce&s;&s;ively cold.</P>
<P N="13">13th. At half an hour pa&s;t ten A. M. pro|ceeded; at one o'clock we came to a hill on the ea&s;t &s;ide, with an old field on its &s;ummit; this hill is called <HI>Batcha-Chooka;</HI> here we found a no|torious gang of thieves, belonging to the town of <HI>Oka Loo&s;a,</HI> a town in the Chactaw nation; when we &s;aw their raft, we took them to be a Creek war party, therefore, being hailed by them, and not choo&s;ing to be &s;hot at, we went near the &s;hore; but on di&s;covering who they were i re|fu&s;ed to land; they &s;till in&s;i&s;ted we mu&s;t, but my ob&s;tinate per&s;i&s;ting to the contrary di&s;ap|pointed their &s;anguine hopes of plunder; and after &s;ome altercation i proceeded. This day the marks of fertility of &s;oil are not &s;o uninterrupted as on the former days. Our weather was clear, and a &s;trong northerly wind prevailed;&mdash;we came nineteen miles &s;ince morning, and encamped on the we&s;t &s;ide, in a low &s;pot of ground.</P>
<P N="14">14th. La&s;t night the fro&s;t was &s;evere; at a quarter pa&s;t nine, A. M. proceeded;&mdash;in half an hour's time we &s;aw very high hills, at a mile, or better, from the river, &s;eemingly covered with pine timber; the&s;e hills the &s;avages call <HI>Nanna Chahaws.</HI> Here is a &s;teep place above forty feet

About a mile and a quarter from hence is a remarkable white &s;and hill on the ea&s;t &s;ide; four miles lower we came to <HI>Yagna-hoolah</HI> (i. e.) the Beloved Ground, which lies on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and is very high, continuing above two miles along the river bank; its lower part is &s;teep and of a whiti&s;h grey, and at the end above two hundred feet high, reckoning perpendicularly. A mile below this is a white &s;and hill on the we&s;t &s;ide; we &s;aw the pine hills all this day, at various di&s;|tances from the river, &s;ometimes clo&s;e to it, and the canes brgin to dimini&s;h, and pine trees mix among the timber. The current for the&s;e two la&s;t days, is very con&s;iderably &s;lackened, and the river widened to above five hundred feet. We came about thirty miles and an half this day, and encamped at four o'clock P. M. on the &s;ide of a kind of bluff, about &s;ix miles below a branch called <HI>I&s;awaya:</HI> all day cold, the latter part and night dull and hazy, at a quarter pa&s;t nine pro|ceeded. Eight miles below our camp we were at the mouth of <HI>Senti Bogue</HI> (i. e.) Snake Creek, having an i&s;land in its mouth, and coming from the we&s;tward. Two miles and a quarter lower is <HI>Atchatickp&eacute;,</HI> a large bay, or lagoon, on the &s;ame &s;ide: at this place is the beginning of our boundary with the Chactaws, running from the we&s;t till it &s;trikes <HI>Senti-Bogue,</HI> and then follows the cour&s;e of &s;aid creek, up to a certain &s;ugar-loaf hill, and &s;o over to <HI>Bogue Hooma,</HI> and <HI>Bak|katan&egrave;.</HI> A mile below this, at the bending of

We &s;aw many &s;pots of pines, and &s;ome white &s;and hills; but in general the &s;oil has a better appearance than ye&s;terday. About an hour be|fore we encamped, we came to the la&s;t rapids, or the fir&s;t from below; here is a remarkable &s;pot of yellow rocks in the we&s;tern bank, beginning with a high, perpendicular, white rock, with &s;ome gra&s;s &s;pots; it is above fifty feet above the pre&s;ent &s;urface of the water; its top is level and &s;hrubby; in the middle projects a remarkable lump, which, in coming down looks exactly like a buttre&s;s again&s;t a wall. At four o'clock P. M. we encamped on the ea&s;t &s;ide in the low ground, above a mile below the rocks, having come thirty-one miles. The weather has been clear and cold all this day.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE following directions to navigators were originally intended as an appendix to the whole work; but i have &s;ince found it requi&s;ite to publi&s;h them &s;ooner; and therefore end this fir&s;t volume with that nece&s;&s;ary part of my work.</P>
<P>The&s;e directions i beg leave to affirm, are en|tirely founded on my own experience; the fir&s;t &s;pur to this undertaking was the lo&s;s of a ve&s;&s;el in 1766, on the coa&s;t of <HI>Florida:</HI> by which I re|ceived a wound in my circum&s;tances, which is as yet far from being healed. I had before this, in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, at a time when I was my&s;elf on board, &s;truck on the &s;outh part of the <HI>Dry Tortu|gus,</HI> when having accidentally a tolerable pilot with me, i pa&s;&s;ed for the fir&s;t time, in-&s;ide of the reef; and made my fir&s;t ob&s;ervations towards this pre&s;ent work: Since that i have pur&s;ued it part|ly during the opportunities i had at the time when i was a provincial deputy &s;urveyor, and partly when i was appointed deputy for the &s;outhern di|&s;trict of <HI>America;</HI> and had the honor of com|manding the ve&s;&s;els on that &s;ervice. Likewi&s;e, while employed by the &s;uperintendant in <HI>We&s;t-Florida;</HI> but far mo&s;t at my own great ex|pence, and fatigue. For even when i was em|ployed, i can &s;afely affirm, that when i could do it without detriment to the &s;ervice, and at times when i did that bu&s;ine&s;s, in a manner which is vulgarly called <HI>by the jobb,</HI> i have done more than was de&s;ired of me; which, however, has never
<PB N="ii" REF="014440_0365_0F92622AF8D4F728">
been the occa&s;ion of any favor being be&s;towed on me, any more than <HI>you did well, and i am glad you did it.</HI> Therefore i am under no manner of obligation to any of the LITTLE GREAT ONES, who have occa&s;ionally u&s;ed me, (&s;ometimes as the monkey did the cat) and this production being undoubtedly my own, as &s;uch i have a right to publi&s;h it.</P>
<P>Thus having &s;hewn how i got my information, i declare my&s;elf free of copying or compiling from prior works, except in that part lying we&s;t from the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> which is taken from <HI>French manu|&s;cript</HI> draughts; and the &s;hape of the coa&s;t and bays ea&s;tward from <HI>Pen&s;acola,</HI> to <HI>Cape St. Blas,</HI> which i have followed from draughts occa&s;ionally &s;een in the hands of Mr. <HI>Stuart,</HI> (the &s;uper-inten|dant) and my good friend Dr. <HI>J. Lorimer,</HI> which draughts i take to be the work of Mr. <HI>Gauld,</HI> a very able and accurate ob&s;erver; but though i kept the &s;hape, the di&s;tances are different from his; and are &s;uch as i have rea&s;on to believe nearer the mark, during a long and tedious cruize i made on this coa&s;t in 1771. As for the &s;oundings, i never had his draughts long enough, to have an opportunity of peru&s;ing them, but they are &s;uch as i have obtained during the &s;ame tedious cruize; as for tho&s;e from <HI>Cape St. Blas,</HI> round to <HI>St. Ma|ry</HI>'s, i have obtained them during the regular pur|&s;uit of gaining &s;urveys of the coa&s;t for above &s;e|ven years.</P>
<P>And as i have in the opinion of many of my friends in my propo&s;als publi&s;hed before i begun this work, reflected a little too &s;everely on the wretch|ed map-makers who have attempted to explain
<PB N="iii" REF="014440_0366_0F92622BB40955B8">
this &s;o intricate navigation, it is &s;till my opinion, that &s;uch exhibitions can not be too much de&s;|pi&s;ed, when attempted on &s;o loo&s;e a foundation, as has been generally done; and we mu&s;t &s;till form a wor&s;e idea of tho&s;e who impo&s;e on the public again&s;t their better knowledge. Both the one and the other has been done. I therefore publi&s;h the pre&s;ent work with no other view than that of pointing out the &s;ad mi&s;takes of the &s;candalous maps daily publi&s;hed by per&s;ons who either not at all, or at be&s;t &s;carce ever &s;aw the ground they treat of, and thus merely for the &s;ake of catching a penny, endanger &s;uch numbers of lives, and &s;uch a va&s;t deal of property;&mdash;&s;uch impo&s;ters are the &s;hame of the nation to which they belong.</P>
<P>I have carefully avoided the change of well-known names of places; but pre&s;erved the old ones, except only in two or three places where the name was not well known, or where there was none at all. Nothing can be more ab&s;urd, or pro|ductive of confu&s;ion, than the a&s;&s;uming new and fanta&s;tical names in places of &s;o much danger; yet the author of a certain pamphlet, publi&s;hed two years ago, has done this at no &s;mall rate.</P>
<P>And for the &s;afety of navigation, i think it a duty incumbent on me, to declare that the &s;ound|ings of what the &s;aid author calls the <HI>Newfound pa&s;&s;age</HI> or <HI>channel</HI> (altho the knowledge thereof is as old as that of <HI>America</HI> it&s;elf) are marked much deeper than they really are; and whoever depends on that pamphlet, will find him&s;elf much impo&s;ed upon; nor do i think my work to be ab&s;olute|ly clear of faults; no, but i venture to &s;ay, that the errors are very few; and as they are unknown
<PB N="iv" REF="014440_0367_0F92622C71664D20">
to me, therefore, whatever mi&s;takes may be di&s;|covered, if communicated by men of knowledge, i &s;hall gladly receive, and willingly amend them.</P>
<P>Ve&s;&s;els bound from <HI>Europe</HI> to <HI>St. Augu&s;tine, Georgia,</HI> or <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> would (in my opinion) &s;horten their pa&s;&s;ages con&s;iderably, by making the &s;outh end of <HI>Abaco,</HI> or the <HI>Hole in the Rock,</HI> in lat. 26&deg; 4&prime; and from that run WbS to make the <HI>Berry-I&s;lands;</HI> from thence WbN, or WNW, till they get into the gulph &s;tream; the only pre|caution to be ob&s;erved is to &s;teer to the we&s;tward of north, after you are clear of the <HI>Grand Bahama</HI> i&s;land, becau&s;e the bank &s;tretches NbW nearly, and the current &s;ets partly on the NW part of the bank; particularly near the <HI>member</HI> or <HI>memory rock.</HI> You may, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, venture on the bank, to the &s;outh of the rock, and beat up to the ea&s;tward, till you bring the rock to bear WNW, and you will not find le&s;s than five fa|thoms water:&mdash;The tide ebbs and flows here a|bout five feet, but you cannot come out on the north of the rock; however, by keeping in the &s;tream, i dare venture to &s;ay you will find a vi&s;i|ble benefit in coming this way.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONS FOR CRUIZERS, WITHIN THE FLORIDA REEF.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e is at <HI>Ceyo Bi&s;cayo,</HI> in lat. 25&deg; 35 N. Here we enter within the reef, from the northward; directions for an ea&s;y approach to the entrance will be given hereafter: Suffice it now to &s;peak of the entrance it&s;elf;&mdash;for about five leagues north of the key, the ground is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul, and looks frightful, but there is no where
<PB N="v" REF="014440_0368_0F92622D387CE448">
le&s;s than 3 fathoms, though by keeping out a|bout 5 or 6 miles from the &s;hore, you will find generally 5 or 6 fathoms, on a fine &s;andy bottom; and when you approach the reef, you may haul in, ob&s;erving to leave the reef a large piece without you, for it has many bad &s;and bars ju&s;t on its in|ner edge: you will not find le&s;s than 3 fathoms, any where within, till you come a brea&s;t the &s;outh end of the key, where there is a &s;mall bank of 11 feet only, give the key a good birth, for there is a large flat &s;tretching off from it. At the &s;outh end of the key, very good water is obtainable by digging, but at a time when by accident of drought or other ways, the wells yield none, then the wa|tering places either in the grand mar&s;h, about 10 miles to the W by S; or the river <HI>Ratones,</HI> about as far to the N W of the key, may be always de|pended upon; at the watering place on the key, is al&s;o an excellent place for careening of ve&s;&s;els, not exceeding ten feet draught. All the&s;e ad|vantageous circum&s;tances, joined to &s;ome of the &s;ame kind at the <HI>Bemini</HI> i&s;lands, make this an ex|cellent &s;tation for cruizers to watch every ve&s;|&s;el bound northward; on the bank without the <HI>Bemini</HI> harbour is good anchorage for large ve&s;|&s;els. The method i would recommend, is to have two ve&s;&s;els, one to &s;erve as a tender to the larger one, and while the one is on the <HI>Bemini</HI> &s;ide, the other ought to be on the <HI>Florida</HI> &s;ide; by this means (the pa&s;&s;age being only 15 leagues wide) no ve&s;&s;el could come through during day, with|out being &s;een by one or the other; and as it is always po&s;&s;ible to get out-&s;ide of the reef, except with a &s;trong N, or N E wind, and flood tide; i
<PB N="vi" REF="014440_0369_0F92622DEF782150">
need not direct &s;eamen how to proceed, in order to &s;peak with any ve&s;&s;el they chance to &s;ee. The many breaks that are in the reef, make it not im|probable that a pa&s;&s;age might be found through even with a N or N E gale. As for the &s;afety in laying within &s;ide, every &s;eaman knows that a reef makes a &s;afe harbour; good ground-tackling is the principal point; &s;hould a chace lead you far north in the &s;tream, there is no difficulty in reaching your &s;tation again; all that's nece&s;&s;ary, is to make the land as &s;oon as you can, only avoid <HI>Cape Ca|naveral,</HI> in lat. 28&deg;: 30&prime;; to the &s;outh of it, you may make pretty free with the &s;hore, except in the bight north of <HI>Rio d'ais,</HI> where there is but 12 feet a league off. To the &s;outh of 26&deg;: 50&prime;, to about 26 there is 7 fathoms at the very beach: here you mu&s;t hug the &s;hore clo&s;e, becau&s;e the &s;tream almo&s;t touches the beach: I was once in great danger hereabouts, by the ill working of the ve&s;&s;el I was in, and had ju&s;t time to let go an anchor in 9 fathoms, and when the ve&s;&s;el rode to it, it would have been an ea&s;y matter for a man to have jumped off from the tafferel on the beach; the beach here is for the mo&s;t part &s;mooth enough for a canoe to land; there being little or no &s;urf on it in good weather.</P>
<P>In the year 1773, i came a pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi,</HI> on board the &s;chooner <HI>Liberty,</HI> commanded by capt. <HI>John Hunt,</HI> we had the misfortune to be over-&s;et at &s;ea, and i conducted the wreck into this place, when having lo&s;t our boat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and ca|boo&s;e, with every other thing from off the deck, we nailed together three half hog&s;heads, in which a man and a boy went on &s;hore, and brought us
<PB N="vii" REF="014440_0370_0F92622FA8843528">
&s;and off, to make a kind of caboo&s;e. I mention this the more, becau&s;e there is water obtainable in almo&s;t every place on this beach, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. But to return to my &s;ubject, to keep the &s;hore on board is the way to get to the &s;outh|ward here; and as on the &s;oundings, the current is chiefly ruled by the wind, it is preferable to come to an anchor with a &s;outherly wind, in&s;tead of &s;tanding out; for the &s;tream will run you out in &s;uch a manner, that you will find it difficult to regain in four or five days, the ground you lo&s;e in one. Yet i would avoid anchoring as much as po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e the ground to the &s;outh of 27&deg; is almo&s;t every where very foul, particu|larly, if you ca&s;t deeper than 15 fathoms: by ob&s;erving this method, you will find it an ea&s;y matter to regain your &s;tation to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>At this place there is va&s;t abundance and vari|ety of fi&s;h, both in the creeks, and out-&s;ide at &s;ea, particularly <HI>groopers</HI> are in great plenty, <HI>king-fi&s;h, Spani&s;h mackrel</HI> and <HI>Barrows</HI> are al&s;o often caught towing; and if you have one or two good hun|ters on board, you may always be provided with plenty of veni&s;on, turkies and bear meat, which are all excellent refre&s;hment, There are for the mo&s;t part deer on the key, and &s;ometimes bear; but by &s;ending to the main, you may depend on finding every kind; in winter, duck and teal a|bound in the creeks; turtle is very plenty; in &s;hort, i know not any place better calculated for a cruizer, than the &s;pot i have now de&s;cribed; add to this, that no fi&s;h is poi&s;onous on the <HI>Florida</HI> &s;hore, not even the <HI>amber-fi&s;h;</HI> but on the <HI>Baha|ma</HI> &s;ide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">recaution i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nece&s;&s;ary; and the logger|head

turtle is never rank of ta&s;te here. The wa|tering place on <HI>Bemini,</HI> is near the ea&s;t end.</P>
<P>The &s;econd place is at the &s;outh end of <HI>Key-Large,</HI> near <HI>Sound-point, Tabona,</HI> and <HI>Rodriguez;</HI> in lat. 25&deg;: 3&prime;. N. Here is the ea&s;termo&s;t pitch of the reef, as <HI>Sound-point,</HI> is of the land, and therefore more proper to be called <HI>Cape Florida,</HI> than any other part of the &s;hore particularly as <HI>Sound-point</HI> is a part of the main land. <HI>Key-Tabon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> is a &s;mall low key, lying about one mile and a quarter without the main keys; and two miles a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d one quarter north of this, lies another &s;omething larg|er, called <HI>Key Rodriguez;</HI> the&s;e two keys are a good mark to know the entrance by, they being both overgrown with mangroves, appear of a darker color than the land before which they lie. When the &s;outhernmo&s;t or <HI>Key Tabona</HI> bears W. 3&frac12; leagues off, then you are near the &s;outh part of the outermo&s;t reef, which is in general almo&s;t dry, and in a few &s;pots entirely dry; run within mu&s;ket &s;hot to the &s;outhward of this dry reef, and then &s;teer ea&s;t, as you go in, and you will have 5 fathoms and upwards; run in on your lead till you begin to &s;ee the inner heads, and then draw northerly till you &s;hoot within the out|er reef; where you may lay pretty &s;afe; however, i would recommend to have a pilot for the fir&s;t trial of this entrance, among the <HI>Providence</HI> peo|ple &s;uch may be had; yet it looks more frightful than it is dangerous; at this place, nine ve&s;&s;els out of ten, that come through the gulph heave in &s;ight, by rea&s;on that this is the land people generally &s;trive to make, coming from <HI>Cuba;</HI> on this account al&s;o, nine out of ten, that are ca&s;t a|way,

are lo&s;t here; if you have a tender, &s;he may &s;ometimes &s;teer over to the bank, about the rid|ing rocks, or <HI>Orange-Key;</HI> yet i think it can be but of little u&s;e, except when the &s;ea&s;on of we&s;t|erly winds is. The channel from bank to bank, is here about 14 leagues a-cro&s;s; but to reach the bank, you ought to &s;teer S. E. over from this &s;tation.</P>
<P>If from this place a chace &s;hould lead you northward, your endeavours ought to be to make <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s <HI>Rocks,</HI> or from <HI>Key-Bi&s;cayno,</HI> above de&s;|cribed, to fall in with the <HI>Bemini,</HI> which is by no means difficult; the la&s;t is the mo&s;t eligible, be|cau&s;e the bank is broad, whereas at <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s <HI>Rocks</HI> you have no &s;oundings in le&s;s than a cables length from the &s;hore, and con&s;equently if you cannot make good a &s;outh cour&s;e, you will be obliged to anchor on the north &s;ide of the rocks, and thus delay much time; but in making the <HI>Bermini,</HI> which lies nearly &s;outh 7 leagues from the rock, you may keep on &s;oundings on the bank; the &s;ounding however, as far as <HI>Beak's Key,</HI> is not very wide. <HI>Beak's-Key</HI> lies S &frac12; E 7&frac12; leagues from <HI>Bemini;</HI> from <HI>Beak</HI>'s-<HI>Key,</HI> to the <HI>Riding Rocks,</HI> and <HI>Roques,</HI> there is working room plenty, and good anchorage; at <HI>Orange-Key</HI> is a good road to the S and S W of it; this key lies S S E 8 leagues from <HI>Beak</HI>'s-<HI>Key;</HI> from <HI>Orange-Key</HI> it is an ea&s;y matter to get to the <HI>Double-Headed-Shot;</HI> the way is to &s;ail early in the morning, &s;teering S W; when you have run about 10 leagues on that cour&s;e, you may begin to look out for <HI>Key-Sal</HI> bank; where, in ca&s;e of need, you may anchor any where; the <HI>Dog-Keys,</HI> and <HI>Dead-man's-Keys,</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="014440_0373_0F9262386BEBDDB0">
&s;hew them&s;elves ea&s;ily, lying on the N W and W part of this bank; they are bold too yet dange|rous; the &s;oundings are narrow near them from here you may either make the <HI>Cuba</HI> &s;hore, or run a-cro&s;s W N W, about 14 or 15 leagues, which will bring you in with the <HI>Florida</HI> reef, to the &s;outhward of your former &s;tation.</P>
<P>You may from <HI>Key-Bi&s;cayo,</HI> come &s;outhwards along the <HI>Florida</HI> &s;hore, on the out-&s;ide of the reef; but as the &s;ounding is very narrow, this way is by no means advi&s;eable; except in fine and moderate weather, when you may keep your boats out, for the winds hereabouts being chief|ly in the ea&s;tern quarter make the reef a very dangerous lee; whereas the <HI>Bahama</HI> &s;ide is per|fectly &s;afe. From <HI>Key-Tabona,</HI> to the N W about a mile lies a very &s;mall key called <HI>Key-Palombo</HI> or <HI>Dove-Key;</HI> which in many &s;ea&s;ons affords good water, but that is &s;eldom; at about ten miles S W from <HI>Key-Tabona</HI> is <HI>Matacombe,</HI> here are &s;eve|ral never-failing wells of excellent water in a rock; whether the&s;e are natural, or artificial is hard to tell: &s;hould the&s;e wells by accident of extreme drought happen to fail, which i believe next to impo&s;&s;ible, you would in that ca&s;e be o|bliged to &s;end for water to <HI>Key-Bi&s;cayo;</HI> which is near 20 leagues from here. Fi&s;h and turtle are in as great plenty here, as at <HI>Bi&s;cayo. Matacombe</HI> yields a few deer of a &s;mall kind; but large deer, bear, and turkeys are not to be had without going to the main for them. I was once in great want of provi&s;ions at <HI>Matacombe,</HI> and &s;ent a hunter with a boy in a &s;kiff to the we&s;tward, at <HI>Sandy-point</HI> or <HI>Cape-Sable;</HI> whence he returned in a few

days, with thirteen large and very fat deer, pro|perly &s;alted and cured, which were excellent pro|vi&s;ions for us for &s;everal days.</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS TO SAIL FROM ST&punc; AUGUSTINE DIRECTLY TO THE ENTRANCE INTO THE IN|SIDE OF FLORIDA OR MARTYR REEF, AT FOOL'S CAPE.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as you are clear of the bar of St. <HI>Au|gu&s;tine,</HI> &s;teer SE ea&s;terly, the di&s;tance of 8 leagues on this cour&s;e will bring you within a|bout 4 leagues right abrea&s;t the <HI>Matancas,</HI> in 10 fathoms water, upon a bottom of fine dark grey &s;and. In continuing from here S E b S you will go along &s;hore at an offing of 4 or 4&frac12; leagues; in your way you will meet with &s;oundings from
<PB N="xxiii" REF="014440_0386_0F926248F21749B8">
10 to 15 fathoms, chiefly on various kinds of &s;and, as the charts fully &s;hew; and &s;ometimes you will meet with a very &s;oft greeni&s;h mud, in which the lead will &s;ink to over the &s;trap. All the &s;ound|ings are in the charts laid down in feet, my lines of which i made u&s;e, being all marked with that mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The above offing you may with &s;afety keep in with ve&s;&s;els of any draught for 25 leagues to the S E ward of the <HI>Matanca;</HI> you will begin to get &s;hells among your &s;oundings at 20 leagues, chief|ly white and black, &s;ometimes mixed with black and grey &s;and, but mo&s;tly the &s;hells by them|&s;elves, very &s;eldom &s;and alone, if you chance to find &s;and only, it will be a coar&s;e grey kind; at 25 leagues as above, you will begin to get red &s;hells, this is a true &s;ign that you approach the Cape <HI>Canaveral</HI> &s;hoal, there being no red &s;hells far to the north of it; now you may begin to haul off, tho' you might continue &s;afely until 7 fa|thoms, or in the day time even in three; that be|ing the depth half a mile without the outer break|er: in hauling off, you will find from 10 to 12 fathoms &s;and &amp; &s;hells, and if you come near to the north ea&s;t end of the &s;hoal, you will often find live cockles, on a black &s;andy bottom, in 10 or 11 fathoms; your offing will be made good on a cour&s;e S E b E from the fir&s;t ca&s;t on red &s;hells, till you judge your&s;elf about 9 leagues off, then if you chu&s;e to make <HI>Indian River</HI> in lat. 27&deg;: 15 run &s;outh. But if you are bound directly to the reef, &s;teer S &frac14; E, which will bring you in with <HI>Hobe</HI> inlet, where the &s;oundings are become quite narrow. In running &s;outh from the outermo&s;t

part of the &s;hore, ob&s;erve when you begin to get very coar&s;e black &s;and: and black &s;hells, for &s;oon after you will find your bottom changed to white &s;and, and your water to deepen; when you find 16 fathoms on white &s;and, you begin to run clear of it, and in 20 or 21 fathoms, you are quite clear, then in continuing the &s;ame cour&s;e your water again &s;hoals, and in a run of about three leagues you once more find red &s;hells, mix'd with black, and red &s;and, continuing a great way; you &s;till &s;hoal your water, and when you come in a|bout 11 fathoms, you will have &s;hells alone, without &s;and:&mdash;all this while you &s;ee no land, it making a bay to the &s;outh of the cape, till you come into about 9 fathoms, when you can ju&s;t &s;ee the <HI>Tortolas,</HI> &s;ome hills &s;o called, in lat. 27&deg;: 35 N. If you want to call at <HI>Indian River</HI> inlet, it is now time to haul in a little for the land; from the <HI>Tortolas</HI> &s;outhward you will again find &s;and, &s;ometimes without &s;hells; from the 9 fathoms above mentioned, it is 8 leagues to the river's mouth.</P>
<P>Here ob&s;erve, that between this inlet, and the Cape <HI>Canaveral,</HI> the coa&s;t is flat, and not to be tru&s;ted &s;o much as the &s;hore north of the cape.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e ob&s;erve that the red &s;hells extend no further &s;outh than this inlet, and but a little way north of the cape &s;hoal; whereby you have an infallible mark in coming well in upon &s;ound|ings, either from the &s;outhward or northward, whereby to know that you are in with, or near to the cape &s;hoal, if even you &s;hould chance to have been without any ob&s;ervation for &s;everal days.</P>
<P><PB N="xxv" REF="014440_0388_0F92614EC186DA98">If you intend to anchor off the river's mouth, take care to run no nearer in than 4 1-2 to 5 fa|thoms, and chu&s;e a &s;pot of &s;helly bottom, as being &s;afer for your cable than the &s;and is here.</P>
<P>In going from the mouth of <HI>Indian River</HI> to the &s;outhward, the coa&s;t is pretty bold, and your cour&s;e is S S E &frac12; E towards <HI>Hobe:</HI> at near 7 leagues from the inlet we meet with &s;ome high rocks on the edge of the beach, which are an excellent mark thereby to know this place; and 4 1-2 leagues further is <HI>Hobe</HI> or the Southern entrance of St. <HI>Lucia</HI> &s;ound, this coa&s;t is &s;o particularly de&s;cribed that further directions to the <HI>Fowey Rocks</HI> are al|mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary. I will however make a few remarks upon the &s;oundings, &amp;c. When you be|gin to &s;ee the above rocks of St. Lucia, you will al&s;o perceive, a change in the colour of your wa|ter, the &s;oundings are here no more then about 5 or 6 leagues broad, and i have been at an achor in 12 or 13 fathoms water, 3 leagues from the &s;hore, when upon trying the current with our log it was found to &s;et to the N E at the rate of 3 1-2 miles per hour, and our water was almo&s;t blue in that depth, therefore it is be&s;t to keep the &s;hore on board, at lea&s;t exceed not 2 leagues from it, your &s;ounding will be various on &s;and, green owze, and &s;hells, as marked in the map; avoid the little reef of <HI>Grooper Hill</HI> a little north of the <HI>&s;pring in the rock,</HI> which &s;pring is in lat 26&deg; 46. N. now it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep clo&s;e along the &s;hore, within the di&s;tance of from half a mile to a mile, and you will find deep water clo&s;e in; the bottom in many places coral and gravel, &s;ometimes rocks, and notwith&s;tanding the foulne&s;s of the

<P>In lat. 26&deg;: 5 is a reef of rocks near the &s;hore, having from 12 to 20 feet of water on it, this reef you mu&s;t give a birth, and at its &s;outh end you will find the mouth of <HI>Rio Del Medio</HI> nearly in lat. 26, from the north end runs off a bank of &s;oundings 5 leagues broad, reaching to the <HI>Fow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rocks;</HI> this reef and bank i have before ob&s;erved is in my opinion the beginning of the <HI>Martyr ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the &s;oundings on this bank vary from 2 to 25 fa|thoms, according to your di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and the bottom is chiefly &s;and; about 2&frac12; leagues S of <HI>Rio Del Medio</HI> is a pretty broad ledge of firm rocks joining the beach under water, which continues to <HI>Boca Ratones,</HI> and is not to be tru&s;ted; abrea&s;t of this ledge you will meet with many &s;pots of coral, &s;punges, rocks, and gra&s;s, which through the clearne&s;s of the water look frightful to the &s;tranger, but have no where le&s;s than 3 fathoms water on them; here fi&s;h is in great plenty.</P>
<P>When you are got &s;outh of <HI>Boca Rattones</HI> the bottom is again clear &s;and, and now ob&s;erve to give <HI>Fools Cape</HI> and <HI>Bear Cut</HI> a good birth, on account of &s;ome flat bars and heads, when you are abrea&s;t <HI>Bear Cut,</HI> keep <HI>Key Bi&s;cay</HI> neare&s;t on board&mdash;take care to avoid the flat off of it, which runs about 1 1-2 mile off; your cour&s;e is S or S b E till you are abrea&s;t of the Soldiers, &amp; as far as them you will at lea&s;t have 15 foot on a clear white &s;andy bottom; <HI>Key Bi&s;cay</HI> affords veni&s;on, and &s;ome times bear,

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR THE NAVIGATION WITHIN THE FLORIDA REEF.</HEAD>
<P>THE next keys to <HI>La Parida y Su Jiguelo,</HI> or, as we &s;tile them, the <HI>Soldiers Keys,</HI> are 7 rocks called <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This word has been in all the Engli&s;h maps ill copied, and transformed into <HI>Mucare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> a &s;ound without meaning.</NOTE> <HI>Ma&s;caras;</HI> the meaning of which word is, that they are but ju&s;t above water. There are &s;ome mangrove and blackwood bu&s;hes on them. Their trenching is neatly to S S W. Next to the&s;e is a &s;mall i&s;land, on which are two &s;mall hills, whence the Spaniards have called it <HI>Las Tetas,</HI> or the <HI>Paps;</HI> but the Providence peo|ple have &s;tiled it <HI>Saunders's Key,</HI> and the inlet to the &s;outh of it <HI>Saunders's Cut,</HI> where a &s;mall ve&s;|&s;el drawing about 4 foot, may enter into the wide &s;ound between the&s;e keys and the watering places on the main.</P>
<P>Near 5 miles S S W of this is an inlet called Black Cae&s;ars Creek, made by the &s;outh end of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ledbury Key,</HI> &s;o called from the &s;now <HI>Ledbury,</HI> com|manded by Capt. <HI>John Lorain,</HI> ca&s;t away here Anno 1760</NOTE> Ledbury Key; this will likewi&s;e admit &s;mall craft into the above &s;ound.</P>
<P>Next is a &s;mall key which does not exceed two miles in length, at its &s;outh end is an inlet known by the name of Angel Fi&s;h Creek; to the &s;outh of this are two very &s;mall keys, and the next is an i&s;land about 5 miles in length, to which no par|ticular name has yet been given. At the &s;outh end of which is again a very &s;mall &s;hallow inlet, and from this the cour&s;e and di&s;tance to Sound
<PB N="xxviii" REF="014440_0391_0F926150B08ABA30">
Point is directly &s;outh 2 leagues. Sound Point is the ea&s;termo&s;t part of the land called Key Largo, though in reality it is no i&s;land, but a penin&s;ula, joined by a narrow i&s;thmus to the main, as the maps accurately &s;hew. This place was till 1769, always taken for an i&s;land, and together with all the keys from <HI>Las Tetas,</HI> and the two next to the S W of this penin&s;ula, been known by the Span|iards under the appellations of <HI>Cayo De doze Leg|gas</HI> and <HI>Cayo Largo,</HI> which la&s;t name we have adopted, and by it, it is known to every one.</P>
<P>The general rule to &s;ail within the reef from the <HI>Soldiers Key</HI> to the &s;outhward is, to have a careful man at ma&s;thead to look out, he will &s;ee all the heads and other &s;hoals a good way off in a clear day, at lea&s;t a mile; thus making the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your pilot, come no nearer to the <HI>Soldiers Key</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 12 foot, nor no farther E from them than 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> foot. About E S E a mile out&s;ide of <HI>Saunders's Cut</HI> lies a &s;mall round bank with only 9 foot on it, from this place to <HI>Black Cae&s;ar's Creek,</HI> the &s;unke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> heads are very frequent, and the bar of &s;aid Creek reaches a great way out. A little north of this inlet the &s;now <HI>Ledbury</HI> was burnt, after a va&s;t deal of trouble, expence and pains taken to get her off. Right a brea&s;t of this &s;pot, and north of the bar, is very fine anchorage in 12 foot clo&s;e to the back of the reef, which makes the inlet afore|&s;aid. On the point of this reef lies the remains of the &s;hip <HI>Hubbard,</HI> ca&s;t away in 1772.</P>
<P>From <HI>Saunders's Cut</HI> to <HI>Sound Point</HI> there is only 11 foot of water to be depended on if you keep in that part of the channel which is cleare&s;t of rocks: you may carry more by going out further to|wards
<PB N="xxix" REF="014440_0392_0F92615171ACCFE8">
the reef: but the care nece&s;&s;ary to he tak|en for the avoiding of the heads, is inconceivable. The bottom to <HI>Black Cae&s;ar's Creek</HI> is &s;and, but from thence to the S W ward it gradually chang|es into a kind of &s;oft marl of the con&s;i&s;tence of dough. When you are well clear of <HI>Angel Fi&s;h Creek</HI> to the &s;outh, the &s;ame rule of keeping with|in 18 and 12 feet depth for the channel is to be ob&s;erved; but after all a careful in&s;pection of my charts, together with a compari&s;on of them with the cour&s;e of the land you &s;ail by, and e&s;|pecially a good look out, will con&s;titute you a better pilot than any directions that can be given for this navigation.</P>
<P>The latitude of <HI>Sound Point</HI> is 25&deg;: 12&prime; a&s;cer|tained by &s;everal good ob&s;ervations. It is need|le&s;s to mention that the long di&s;puted &s;ituation of <HI>Cape Florida,</HI> is obviou&s;ly fixed in this point; any mariner that &s;ails along this coa&s;t, will by the &s;malle&s;t attention to the changes of his cour&s;e, find that it is the only &s;pot that forms a true pro|montory, from the <HI>Spring in the Rock</HI> in lat. 26&deg; 46, down to here, in the manner as my charts &s;hew.</P>
<P>It is on this promontory that almo&s;t every ve&s;|&s;el that is ca&s;t away meets her fate, i mean on the large reef that lies before it; the &s;outh point of which is dry, and forms a deep channel to go in towards two little keys called <HI>Rodriguez</HI> and <HI>Tabo|na;</HI> and its north point extends as far north as Angel Fi&s;h Creek. The people who watch tho&s;e misfortunes to make a benefit by them, know this &s;o well that during the &s;ummer months, the &s;ea&s;on for the return of &s;hips from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> they &s;tation them&s;elves at anchor a little &s;outh of the
<PB N="xxx" REF="014440_0393_0F9261522ECD4708">
point from whence they can with certainty wait for the &s;ight of any &s;hip that is unhappy enough to be drove on &s;hore on this reef.</P>
<P>Since i have mentioned the&s;e people, i cannot forbear taking notice of the abu&s;e generally thrown upon them very unde&s;ervedly. I know of more in&s;tances than one, where they have been ill treated for their &s;ervices. What the be|haviour of the wreckers is in the windward pa&s;|&s;age, i cannot determine; but i appeal to every candid man, who has been &s;o unfortunate as to have occa&s;ion for the help of the turtlers and wood-cutters, who frequent this coa&s;t from <HI>Pro|vidence,</HI> whether they have not always yielded their a&s;&s;i&s;tance with greater expedition and regu|larity, and with more di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s than could be expected? And as for the idle tale which we are told of their making fal&s;e lights on the &s;hore, i can, from many years experience, a&s;&s;ure it to be an untruth. Tho&s;e fires are occa&s;ioned by the hunters and timber-cutters, who burn the woods to clear them of under-wood, and to procure fre&s;h pa&s;ture for the deer. Lightning al&s;o often &s;ets fire to trees; and i have frequently, in very dry &s;ea&s;ons, &s;een &s;pontaneous fires ari&s;e in mar&s;hy places. But after all what bu&s;ine&s;s has a marinet (who knows the cour&s;e he mu&s;t &s;teer) to follow any light-out of that cour&s;e? And i would ju&s;t hint to every one who pa&s;&s;es along this coa&s;t, that on &s;ee|ing a light to the we&s;tward, it behoves him to look out for breakers if he &s;tands in for that quarter.</P>
<P>This promontory is a <HI>penin&s;ula,</HI> though it has till lately pa&s;t for an i&s;land. Anno 1769, i with
<PB N="xxxi" REF="014440_0394_0F9261552C267D80">
great labour, fatigue, the inconvenience of mu&s;|ketoes, and a total want of fre&s;h water for 4 or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> days, explored its in&s;ide waters. I was &s;timula|ted to this enterprize by the reports of the <HI>Provi|dence</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> fi&s;hermen, who told me unani|mou&s;ly that they had often e&s;&s;ayed to enter at <HI>Angel Fi&s;h Creek,</HI> and come out at <HI>Boca Herrera,</HI> the creek oppo&s;ite <HI>Key Tabona,</HI> or the contrary, but always in vain; nor did any of them know an in&s;tance of its being done. I then entered at <HI>Angel Fi&s;h Creek,</HI> and after a great deal of time &s;pent and no pa&s;&s;age found. I at la&s;t entered in|to the lake &s;pecified in the chart, by drawing the boat over dry ground for above &s;ix times her own length. Out of this Jake i found my way by a very warrow pa&s;&s;age at its &s;outh end; but as no part of <HI>Key Largo</HI> yields any fre&s;h water, and after we got into the above named lake, all the ground around us was mangrove &s;wamp, we were unable to find any; two of my people were nearly exhau&s;ted and &s;pent by thir&s;t, which we could not po&s;&s;ibly alleviate until we reached the watering place at <HI>Matacombe.</HI> This by way of caution, if any &s;tranger might come here. And after finding abundance of fre&s;h water on every part of the coa&s;t, he may not venture to be out for any purpo&s;e, within this <HI>penin&s;ula</HI> for above half a day, without a &s;tore of that invaluable nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cape-Florida,</HI> or <HI>Sound-Point</HI> to <HI>Key-Re|driguez,</HI> the cour&s;e and di&s;tance is S W &s;ix miles&punc; there is a good harbour for &s;mall craft to the NW part of the i&s;land, made by a reef running off from its N E end, and another good &s;heltering
<PB N="xxxii" REF="014440_0395_0F926155862E4298">
place to the SW of it, but neither has a greater depth than 9 feet at low water. This i&s;land is only a large thicket of mangrove, without a foot of dry &s;oil on it, and affords only &s;ome <HI>Aquatic</HI> birds and their eggs.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Sound Point</HI> or <HI>Cape Florida,</HI> (by which la&s;t name i &s;hall henceforth call it,) and this la&s;t i&s;land is another &s;heltering place, or road&s;tead, for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, within a ridge or reef on which we generally &s;ee &s;ome turtle crawls, but it is &s;el|dom occupied except by the timber-cutters, the <HI>penin&s;ula</HI> affords in this place <HI>Lignum-Vitae, Ma&s;|tick</HI> and <HI>Mohogany,</HI> the two la&s;t are indeed found on every part thereof, but on none of the keys north of <HI>Saunders-Key</HI> or <HI>Las-Tetas</HI> nor on none to the &s;outh of the la&s;t key north of <HI>young-Mata|combe,</HI> all the&s;e timbers are however now nearly cut off.</P>
<P>This <HI>penin&s;ula</HI> affords no living creature except <HI>racoons</HI> and in&s;ects, e&s;pecially tho&s;e trouble&s;ome ones, <HI>mu&s;ketoes</HI> and <HI>&s;corpions.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>Cape</HI> or <HI>Sound Point,</HI> the direction of the coa&s;t alters to S W; and the di&s;tance to the &s;outhern extremity of this <HI>penin&s;ula</HI> is 10 or 11 miles. Be&s;ides <HI>Key Rodriguez</HI> we meet with <HI>Key Tabona,</HI> 2 1-2 miles from Rodriguez, on a S W cour&s;e; in going S W ward from the <HI>Cape,</HI> the &s;ame rule as above directed for keeping within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8. and without of 12 foot, mu&s;t be ob&s;erved. The channel here is pretty wide; but a man mu&s;t be kept at ma&s;t head to di&s;cover heads, as &s;ome rocks lie in this tract; e&s;pecially near <HI>Key Tabona.</HI> This <HI>Key Tabona</HI> has ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;mall harbour within a reef as <HI>Key Rodriguez.</HI> This key has little of
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="014440_0396_0F9261566ED63C00">
no high ground on it; it affords land crabs, a few doves, and other birds. One mile to the we&s;t of this key the &s;outh point of the <HI>penin&s;ula</HI> makes a creek &s;carce a mu&s;ket &s;hot wide, admitting only of boats: This creek is by the Spaniards called <HI>Boca Herrera;</HI> the bay within abounds with <HI>Red Drum</HI> and &s;ome other fi&s;h, and a great deal of green and loggerhead turtle; lob&s;ters likewi&s;e are in va&s;t plenty between the <HI>cape</HI> and this creek.</P>
<P>Within and between the above two keys lies a third called <HI>Dove-Key,</HI> it is very &s;mall, gravelly and rather high, with very few bu&s;hes on it; during rainy &s;ea&s;ons it affords good fre&s;h water and a few doves: we al&s;o find pur&s;lain growing on it. From <HI>Key Tabona</HI> due ea&s;t lies the &s;outhern point of the great reef making a wide channel, this &s;outh point is dry, the channel is 5 fathoms deep, and &s;hips in di&s;tre&s;s may find &s;helter under this point; it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to point out any lead|ing mark as the reef lies 10 or 11 miles from the land; but my chart &s;hews it plain, and a good look out for heads is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential pilotage here.</P>
<P>From the &s;outhwe&s;t part of the <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> the cour&s;e is S W di&s;tance 6 or 7 miles, pa&s;t two more keys of no note, &s;till belonging to the <HI>Groupe</HI> of i&s;les called <HI>Key Largo,</HI> we then come to an i&s;land of &s;ome note called <HI>Young Matacombe,</HI> it is 4 miles long, trending S W; it has nothing remarkable on it except a well of good fre&s;h water on its ea&s;t end, this however is known to few and con&s;equent|ly little frequented; off the S W end of this key lies a &s;mall drowned mangrove i&s;land, and a channel 10 foot deep runs in to the &s;outh of it and &s;hoots
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="014440_0397_0F926156B404F4A0">
up to within the great key, but there being no|thing on the key to attract much notice it is &s;el|dom vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>In coming this way from <HI>Key Tabona</HI> the chan|nel is in general deeper than before, but the &s;ame rule of keeping without 12 and within 18 feet &s;till holds good; directly abrea&s;t of <HI>Young Matacombe,</HI> 1&frac12; miles E from the land are a parcel of danger|ous &s;unken heads called the <HI>Hen and Chickens,</HI> which require a good look out to be kept.</P>
<P>Next is <HI>Old Matacombe,</HI> remarkable for being the mo&s;t handy and be&s;t watering place on all this coa&s;t, on its ea&s;t end are 5 wells in the &s;olid rock, &s;aid to be cut by the &s;avages, but to me they appear natural cha&s;ms, they yield excellent water in abundance, and &s;ome ponds near it like|wi&s;e afford &s;ome, in&s;omuch that in a wet &s;ea&s;on all the ea&s;t end of the key is overflown, and water enough to be had for to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ity of a fleet; the key is 4 miles long, and at its we&s;t end are likewi&s;e &s;ome ponds and wells, but the water is of a much inferior quality. This key was one of the la&s;t habitations of the &s;avages of the <HI>Coloo&s;a</HI> nation: about a mile to the ea&s;t of the N E end of <HI>Matacombe</HI> lies a &s;mall bu&s;hy, gravelly key on the extremity of a reef, this key is called <HI>Matanca,</HI> i. e. Murder, from the cata&s;trophe of a French crew &s;aid to have amounted to near three hundred men, who were unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of the <HI>Coloo&s;as,</HI> which &s;avages de&s;troyed them to a man on this &s;pot. This <HI>Key Matanca</HI> lies SSW 2 miles from the &s;mall man-grove key &amp; is the leading mark for finding the watering place on <HI>Matacombe,</HI> for come from whatever quarter you

plea&s;e, the way is to run boldly up to within pi&s;tol &s;hot of the N E part of this &s;mall key, when you will find your&s;elf at the chops of a channel which leads up to the watering place; it admits of 10 foot and is bounded on its N &s;ide by a very &s;hallow reef which divides this channel from the channel to the &s;outh of <HI>Young-Matacombe,</HI> the channel is &s;o plain that the be&s;t direction is the eye; the tides are very rapid, con&s;equently require to be con|&s;ulted both in coming in or going out, the chan|nel is very narrow having only ju&s;t room enough for a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el to turn to windward.</P>
<P>From the &s;outh end of the great reef of <HI>Tabona</HI> it is no longer a continued reef, but all in divided &s;pots as the chart &s;hews, and the channel within them is likewi&s;e wider and deeper, but you will find le&s;s &s;mooth water than from <HI>Key Bi&s;cay</HI> to <HI>Key Tabona.</HI></P>
<P>To the we&s;t end of <HI>Matacombe</HI> is another chan|nel which is the fir&s;t that opens (for a ve&s;&s;el of 6 foot draught) into the gulph of Mexico.</P>
<P>To &s;ail into this channel you mu&s;t borrow pretty near to the key at its we&s;t end, where you will have 10 foot water, then &s;teer in north to|wards a clu&s;ter of &s;mall mangrove keys for about a league; when you are within half a mile of the bank of &s;aid keys you alter your cour&s;e to WNW and you will &s;oon find your&s;elf between two very &s;hallow banks, and &s;hoal your water to 6 foot; now you will &s;ee many points of banks which will oblige you frequently to loof and bear away between the W, WSW, &amp; WNW, the banks are almo&s;t dry, but the channel of an even depth &s;hows blue; &s;o that a careful eye cannot mi&s;s it.
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="014440_0399_0F9261594E41BFF0">
The&s;e cour&s;es continue for 4 leagues, when you will find your channel to widen very much. Now &s;teer NNW 3 miles and you will &s;ee <HI>Cayo Axi,</HI> or <HI>Sandy Key</HI> in the NW about 1&frac12; leagues off; then alter your cour&s;e to we&s;t, come no nearer than within a league of the key, and in five miles you will deepen your water to 9 feet, continue your cour&s;e W till the key bears ENE and you have &s;ea room into the <HI>Gulph of Mexico,</HI> but the &s;oundings deepen very &s;lowly to the we&s;tward and north|ward; take care never to attempt this pa&s;&s;age without a leading wind.</P>
<P>N. B&middot; <HI>Sandy Key</HI> is a low key covered with &s;ome bu&s;hes and prickly-pears; there are rabbits on it, and always plenty of <HI>flamingoes, plovers,</HI> and other excellent water fowl to be had.</P>
<P>NW four miles from this key is <HI>Punto Tancha,</HI> or <HI>Sandy Point;</HI> here was anciently a &s;ettlement of <HI>Coloo&s;a</HI> &s;avages. Tolerable water, and excel|lent veni&s;on are to be had here.</P>

At the SW end is a channel of 9 foot depth into the Gulph of Mexico, plainly marked on the map, for which a good and careful look-out is the be&s;t director.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cayo Vivoras</HI> S W b W 10 miles brings you to a remarkable contraction of the channel between the outer reef and the keys, your depth is generally 18 foot, the bottom &s;andy, and a con&s;iderable broad bank runs off from the i&s;lands,

which are the <HI>Cayos Vacas,</HI> i. e. <HI>Cow Keys.</HI> At this contraction of the channel your cour&s;e alters to W S W, and you go through the like draught of water for 5 leagues, then the reefs are again further off, and you are come to the we&s;termo&s;t of the <HI>Cow Keys,</HI> in lat 24&deg;:41, where another channel of 6 or 7 foot deep goes into the <HI>Mexican Gulph.</HI> On the&s;e keys is tolerable water and plenty of deer.</P>
<P>The next i&s;lands are called the <HI>Bahia Honda</HI> keys, extending E and W for 5 leagues, your cour&s;e is W: and your depth of water 17 or 18 feet; at the ea&s;t end of the we&s;termo&s;t key is a|nother channel 8 feet deep, opening the gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and leads as the chart explains; but being difficult, it is &s;eldom attempted. Midway before the&s;e i&s;lands 2 leagues to the &s;outh is a dry &s;and-bar, on which, in the &s;ea&s;on, the &s;ea-fowl lay a great quantity of eggs.

At a little more than 2 leagues you find a harbour called <HI>Newfound-Harbour;</HI> it is &s;afe, but the bottom foul in many places. The depth of water in this cour&s;e is from 17 to 23 feet. About half way between <HI>Newfound-Harbour</HI> and <HI>Key We&s;t,</HI> are &s;ome heads of rocks, as laid down in the chart, but they are ea&s;ily di&s;covered in fair weather.

<P>At the we&s;t end of <HI>Cayo Hue&s;o,</HI> is a pa&s;&s;age into the <HI>Gulph of Mexico,</HI> this key, or rather the&s;e keys (being made up of &s;everal) extend about SW and NE for 10 miles, having a &s;hallow bank before it. The S W end lies in lat. 24&deg;. N long. 81&deg;:15 we&s;t; it has a &s;hallow ledge clo&s;e to it on the &s;outh, and the point is a low kind of &s;avannah, on which one or two &s;ingle trees appear; near which is a well of very ordinary water. The way into the channel is to give the &s;outh point a birth till you have the channel well open to the north of you, then &s;teer in and keep the key clo&s;e on board within 15 or 20 fathoms, you will find from 24 to 16 foot water, run in till you bring the N E end of a &s;hoal on your larboard hand to bear near WNW, then double the point of the i&s;land to the we&s;tward, and you may anchor in 16 or 18 foot water, but the bottom is foul and the road|&s;tead un&s;afe, e&s;pecially in N and NW winds. Round the &s;hoal to the we&s;tward is another chan|nel rather deeper, but not &s;o direct; and half a mile to the north of the &s;hoal is a bar having &s;carce 14 foot on it; after pa&s;&s;ing which you may &s;teer N &frac12; W and you will in a run of 2&frac12; leagues clear the ea&s;tern bank, gradually deepen|ing your water, as the map &s;hews. The tide here runs violently. Within the anchoring place ea&s;tward of the point, is a path leading to a well or pond of excellent fre&s;h water; round which a low kind of &s;tone wall is placed, and the trees are marked with many names; the ground is trodden like a &s;heep crawl, occa&s;ioned by the deer who

<P>If you are bound to &s;ea from this key, &s;ail from the SW end directly for a &s;andy key, which you will &s;ee in the SE near 3 leagues off, and you will have generally about 23 or 24 foot depth, bor|row clo&s;e on the we&s;t end of this &s;and &s;o as you might chuck a bi&s;cuit on &s;hore, and you will find 5 fathoms, which &s;uddenly deepens, and two miles carry you off of the bank into the gulph &s;tream. 3 leagues we&s;t from this &s;andy key lies another &s;imilar to it, being the la&s;t part of the reef, the <HI>Havana</HI> bears from here nearly S &frac12; E, and is a|bout 20 leagues off; but ve&s;&s;els bound there will do well in &s;teering higher up, if po&s;&s;ible, on account of the currents. The tide ebbs &amp; flows here regularly 6 foot, and the time of full &s;ea at full and change of the moon is 8 o'clock, as it is every where from Key <HI>Vacas</HI> to the <HI>Dry Tortugas,</HI> the tides &s;etting as the darts de&s;cribe. The tides from Key <HI>Vacas</HI> northea&s;tward ri&s;es not quite &s;o high, and the time of full &s;ea is from 7 to 8 o' clock, being later as you come we&s;tward; the darts &s;hew the &s;etting of the tides: to the northward of <HI>Key Bi&s;cay</HI> the current on &s;oundings is much governed by the wind; but when the wind has little influence the ebb &s;ets north, and the flood &s;outhward.

In Augu&s;t of the year 1766, i was becalmed near this place, and drifted for 3 days, not having had

an ob&s;ervation for 5 days before on account of fogs. I was very unea&s;y e&s;pecially on the ap|pearance of a dove on the evening of the la&s;t day, this kept us all night (more than common) watchful; and at the break of day next morning we &s;ounded in 30 fathom. We kept the lead going, and &s;hoaled our water gradually to 20 fa|thorns, when it was full day, but &s;till foggy, on which i gave orders if the water &s;hoaled to 12 fa|thom to come to an anchor (our drift was then with the current, which i afterwards found to be the tide of flood &s;etting to the northward on the bank) and i left the deck; but had &s;carce &s;at down in the cabin when the ve&s;&s;el which drew between 8 and 9 foot water &s;truck, and as it were drag|ged over a coral bank, i &s;tarted up and hove the lead overboard, when i found 18 foot water on &s;and, and &s;aw a dry bank or key clo&s;e too to we&s;t|ward, the currant &s;till running with violence. We came immediately to anchor, and threw the boat out, in order to examine the place where we were, we found our&s;elves &s;urrounded by three very &s;mall low &s;and keys (full of prickly pears) on the we&s;t, and a reef every where el&s;e.

to ri&s;e and fall full 6 foot, and the place where we &s;truck at fir&s;t to have between 6 and 7 feet of water on it, when the tide was out, it being 9 o'clock when it began to ebb; i thence fixed the full &s;ea at about 8 o'clock on the full or change or a S E b E &frac12; E moon. All the&s;e ob&s;ervations i have &s;ince been confirmed in by a more frequent experience. This adventure was my fir&s;t know|ledge of the <HI>Martyrs,</HI> and was the rai&s;ing of the fir&s;t idea in me of publi&s;hing this work. The calms continuing i tided it up within the reef as far as <HI>Matacombe,</HI> where we watered and proceed|ed out into the &s;tream; i became very &s;en&s;ible of what a great benefit the knowledge of this reef is to all people, who by means of calms, or other|wi&s;e have a long pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Cape Antonio</HI> up; e&s;pecially on account of refre&s;hing.

<P>The &s;oundings, as i have marked them, were ob|tained at &s;everal times pa&s;&s;ing near and round this &s;hoal, they are remarkable, and for them you may rely on the draught. I ob&s;erved the variation of the compa&s;s to be 5&deg;:47&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>On the NW corner of the bank is a harbour where i have made the ob&s;ervations that are laid down in the draught, at three or four different times; but as it is only planned by the eye, never having had an opportunity to make a circum&s;tan|tial &s;urvey i &s;hall forbear &s;aying any more a|bout it than that the northermo&s;t part of the bank lies by good and repeated ob&s;ervations taken by my&s;elf in lat 24&deg; 48.N.</P>

&s;ay &s;omething more concerning the reef, and give my advice to &s;uch as are bound through the gulph of Florida.</P>
<P>Many people talk about going &s;outhward thro' the <HI>Gulph of Florida</HI> by keeping upon &s;oundings out&s;ide the reef, but it is a navigation &s;o danger|ous, that i would wi&s;h every body (except in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity) to avoid it. I will however, tran&s;cribe the remarks of Robert Bi&s;hop on this navigation, and add a few ob&s;ervations of my own on them.</P>
<Q><P>When we were &s;ailed out of <HI>Port Royal Har|bour,</HI> we kept upon &s;oundings, till we came as far to the &s;outhward as <HI>Tybee,</HI> and then we &s;tood to the E and afterwards to the S till we were got into the lat. of 26 d N and then run down in that parallel, and made the S end of <HI>Abaco,</HI> or <HI>The hole in the wall,</HI> and N W by W di&s;t. 5 or 6 miles from it, we anchored in white water, of about 7 fathom, off a point where the key falls in, &amp; there we got fi&s;h in plenty, for which purpo&s;e we anchored, as al&s;o to delay time for 4 or 5 hours. At 2 PM we weighed, and &s;tood S W for the <HI>Berry I&s;lands,</HI> which we made and came upon &s;oundings at 8 ditto. The cour&s;e is S W di&s;tance 8 leagues; and from tho&s;e i&s;lands to <HI>Providence,</HI> the cour&s;e is S S E di&s;tance 12 leagues.</P>
<P>When we got &s;oundings, we kept our lead going, &amp; we laid by it all night, keeping in, or out, as we deepened or &s;hallowed our water; but our cour&s;e was between the W and W by N and our di&s;t. 15 leagues.</P>
<P>The breadth of &s;oundings (at lea&s;t from the <HI>Berry</HI> to <HI>I&s;aac Rock</HI>) is from 3 to 5 miles

<P>At a cables length off the W &s;ide of <HI>I&s;aac Rock,</HI> you have no &s;oundings: So that as you come round it, you immediately get into ocean water, and con&s;equently into the current of the <HI>Gulph.</HI> But if it &s;hould happen that the wind be at S S E and you cannot lie S or S by E &s;o as to take the current under your lee, and keep the bank on board, your be&s;t way will be to anchor, or keep in upon &s;oundings to the northward of <HI>I&s;aac Rock,</HI> till the wind comes favourable.</P>

<P>At <HI>Cape Corientas</HI> is anchorage in 5 or 6 fathom about 2 miles to the NW by N or NNW of the cape, but you mu&s;t be careful in going into this bay to give the cape a birth of a league at lea&s;t, on account of a &s;hoal that runs to the SW off from the pitch of the cape; the water in the wells is indifferent, but ea&s;y enough to come at.</P>

<P>I could &s;ay more on this &s;ubject, but a &s;mall matter of in&s;pection into my maps will &s;hew that there is a vortex of current near and within the&s;e &s;hoals: I therefore judge it recommendable to any per&s;on bound round this cape, to keep a N N W cour&s;e for about 8 or 10 leagues to avoid them, and when you come as far to the northward as the lat 24&deg;:00 N, by all means keep a good look|out, for in this pa&s;&s;age you will nine times in ten meet with a &s;trong current out of the <HI>Mexican Gulph</HI> &s;etting ea&s;tward, &s;ometimes at the rate of 2&frac12; knots; this current will &s;et you on &s;oundings on the <HI>Tortuga</HI> bank before you are aware thereof. In foggy weather the&s;e &s;oundings may be a guide, my charts mark them properly.

always found a &s;trong windward current ea&s;t of that place, &s;o that if i once weathered it, i was &s;el|dom more than 12 hours in getting up to <HI>Punta Guana,</HI> being the we&s;t point of the Bay of <HI>Matanca.</HI></P>
<P>From this point mo&s;t people chu&s;e to &s;tretch over, and Mr. <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> advi&s;es the bringing of the <HI>Pan de Matanca</HI> S, or S b E, before one puts over for the gulph, and then to &s;teer N N E; both are right enough; but i &s;hall endeavour to point out a &s;afer way.</P>
<P>From <HI>Punta Guanos</HI> to <HI>Key Sal,</HI> the cour&s;e is E N E &s;omewhat ea&s;terly 23 leagues.</P>
<P>From the &s;mall key of <HI>Punta Ycaco</HI> to <HI>Key Sal,</HI> is N E b E near 13 leagues.</P>
<P>From <HI>Key Sal</HI> to <HI>Deadmans Keys,</HI> on the <HI>Double-headed-&s;hot</HI> bank, is N b W 5 leagues. And,</P>
<P>From <HI>Deadmans Keys</HI> to the &s;outh point of the <HI>Cape Reef,</HI> is N W b N 19 or 20 leagues.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame <HI>Deadmans Keys</HI> to the <HI>Riding Rocks,</HI> is N E b N 23 leagues.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Riding Rocks</HI> lie E b N 19 leagues from the &s;outh point of the <HI>Cape Reef.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it follows, that from <HI>Punta Ycaco</HI> to the &s;outh point of the <HI>Cape Reef,</HI> the cour&s;e is nearly N, and the di&s;tance 29 leagues.</P>
<P>It is hardly po&s;&s;ible that a ve&s;&s;el &s;hould fall &s;o far leeward as the &s;and bar of <HI>Key Vacos,</HI> or <HI>Key Loo,</HI> unle&s;s that &s;upine carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and drow&s;y humor too common among the greate&s;t part of the Engli&s;h &s;ailors, might cau&s;e the crew to let her run 4 or 5 points leeward of her cour&s;e.</P>
<P>For tho&s;e, however, that may meet with &s;uch an accideat, i will point out the &s;ituation of tho&s;e keys.</P>
<P><PB N="lx" REF="014440_0423_0F92617373CD8D08">Mr. <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> has evidently mi&s;taken the &s;and bar of <HI>Key Vacas</HI> for <HI>Key Loo,</HI> which may ea&s;ily be the ca&s;e without my impeaching his judgment, for they look exactly alike: I am led to think &s;o when he &s;ays, "from the <HI>Havana</HI> to&mdash;<HI>Looe Key,</HI> is N E b N, di&s;tant 32 leagues."

<P>From the foregoing Cour&s;es and di&s;tances the Intelligent mariner will ea&s;ily &s;ee, that <HI>Punta Ycaco</HI> is the mo&s;t eligible place from whence to take his departure when bound through the <HI>Gulph</HI> of <HI>Florida.</HI> My advice therefore is, that if he makes the keys of <HI>Punta Ycaco</HI> early in the day, to delay time till 3 o'clock P. M. at lea&s;t, or rather 4, his time may be u&s;efully employed in fi&s;hing on the reef north of the point; for his labour and delay will be amply compen&s;ated by the excellent re|fre&s;hment and &s;tore of fine fi&s;h it will afford him. The depth of water is from 4 to 14 fathom; but venture no nearer than 4 fathom, and beware of a &s;unken rock lying about a mile we&s;tward from the we&s;ternmo&s;t key.</P>
<P>By doing this, and towards evening taking your departure from here, &amp; &s;teering NbE, or ra|ther NNE, if you are to &s;ee land on the we&s;tern &s;hore, you will &s;ee it early in the morning, (provided you

have wind enough) &amp; thus your &s;afety through is &s;e|cured, but by all means endeavour to get as much ea&s;ting as you can, (unle&s;s in winter when the winds hang to the we&s;tward, for in that ca&s;e <HI>Flo|rida</HI> is &s;afe&s;t) to get next to the <HI>Bahama Bank,</HI> for here you find pretty broad regular &s;oundings, and have a weather &s;hore, whereas <HI>Florida</HI> has little or no &s;oundings and is a lee &s;hore. For nine tenths of the year, you may venture on the <HI>Bahama Bank</HI> always &s;afely as far as in 6 or 7 fathom, which cir|cum&s;tance will acquaint you of your &s;afety in the night, &s;hould you be more than one day getting through, and be on the weather &s;ide of the pa&s;|&s;age: Let me however caution you to get off the bank before you pa&s;s the lat. 25&deg;:30&prime; to the N ward for fear of <HI>I&s;aacs Rocks.</HI></P>
<P>During my &s;everal cruizes within the <HI>Martyr</HI> reef, i have &s;een a great number of ve&s;&s;els borrow &s;o clo&s;e on the reef, as that they appeared to be within it, and &s;ometimes i could even &s;ee the peo|ple with help of a gla&s;s, &s;uch i &s;uppo&s;e are well acquainted, or very bold: but be the man who does this never &s;o experienced, he mu&s;t be careful to keep a &s;trict look-out; for my part i would not come nearer than ju&s;t to rai&s;e the land, e&s;pecially as tides may have their influence fur|ther off than we are aware of. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the end of this appendix.</NOTE></P>

too much on this falacious information; i could therefore not forbear again hinting at it in this place. Nor can we in the very in&s;tance under the pre&s;ent con&s;ideration, too much admire the ex|ten&s;ive goodne&s;s of the All-gracious Ruler of the univer&s;e towards us weak mortals, by providing &s;o facile a navigation for the regions of the we&s;t, by means of a velocious current, and by &s;o di&s;po&s;ing the &s;everal &s;hores of this mazy labyrinth of reefs and keys, as to cau&s;e this u&s;eful current to run in a direction N E, and at &s;o great a rate as 3 or 3&frac12; miles an hour, by which means we are enabled better to avoid the eminent dangers of this reef, when it becomes a lee &s;hore, for the violence of the ea&s;terly gales beats the gulph water over the reef, &s;o as to de&s;troy the effects of the flood tides, by cau&s;ing a con&s;tant reverberating current from the &s;hore over the reef, in&s;omuch that a ve&s;&s;el riding under the reef will lay with her &s;tern to windward. I once came out from <HI>Matacombe,</HI> and was &s;carce clear of the reef before i was over|taken by a gale from the ea&s;tward, which was very violent; it was 5 o'clock in the evening, and it being too dark to attempt a re-entrance of the reef, i was forced to heave the ve&s;&s;el too, which i did under her balanced main&s;ail; &s;he was a heavy &s;chooner of about 70 tons, and a dull &s;ailor: the &s;ucceeding night i pa&s;&s;ed in the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s of mind, &s;eeing the burning of the breakers in con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion on the reef till pa&s;t 1 o'clock; the &s;torm continued till 10 next morning, when i made &s;ail to the northward, and at noon to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment, i had an ob&s;ervation of the &s;un's altitude, which proved me to be in lat 26&deg;:

50&prime;, by which i had made a difference of lat. of 118 minutes in the &s;hort &s;pace of 19 hours (17 of which i lay too.) I think this &s;o extraordina|ry an in&s;tance of the rapidity of this current, and &s;o evident a proof of the rea&s;on of the increa&s;ed velocity thereof, that i could not omit relating it. When i treat of the <HI>Behama</HI> bank, it will however appear, that on that &s;ide the &s;hore is not &s;o &s;teep, and therefore not &s;o dangerous.</P>
<P>I am an utter enemy to all theoratical &s;y&s;te|matic po&s;itions, which has cau&s;ed in me an inde|fatigable thir&s;t for finding in my experience, cau&s;|es for all extraordinary appearances, be they what they will. And my experimental po&s;ition of the cau&s;e of the increa&s;e of the velocity of this current, during the gales that blow contrary to its direction, is no other than the reverber|ating current, occa&s;ioned by the &s;welling of the water within the reef, which in the memorable gale of October, Anno 1769, when the <HI>Ledbury</HI> was lo&s;t, was no le&s;s than 30 feet above its ordinary level; which height will appear the more &s;ur|prizing when we come to con&s;ider the &s;pacious &s;urface of the &s;ounds that were filled by it.</P>
<P>Having thus led the careful mariner through the reefs into the open gulph, there only remains for me to give a caution again&s;t the <HI>Memory Rock,</HI> for which ample in&s;tructions are given in a hint at the very beginning of this tract. My next care will be to give &s;ome</P>

<P>IF you are bound into this river keep the NW cour&s;e till you are in lat. 29&deg; 10 N, then run down for the river on a W cour&s;e; if you happen to fall in to the northward of the mouth, come no nearer than 15 fathom, when you will have coar&s;e brown &s;and; then run S, or S half W, keeping your lead going, till you come on &s;ound|ings &s;o &s;oft that the lead will bring none of the mud up, unle&s;s it be woolded with canva&s;s; if then the wind be free, run the above cour&s;e or ra|ther more we&s;terly; but by all means take care you are not to the &s;outhward of the la&s;t mention|ed latitude when you run down on a W cour&s;e, for fear of falling in to the &s;outh of the river: When you approach the rivers mouth, which you will by running about 4 miles on the above &s;oft

&s;oundings, you will &s;ee the color of the water alter, and it will appear like a &s;hoal; this is oc|ca&s;ioned by the current of the river mixing with the &s;ea; but you need apprehend no danger, for there is from 25 to 30 fathom water, therefore run boldly in till you have about 8 fathom, the bank is pretty &s;teep; when you are in this depth, you will &s;ee &s;ome mud i&s;lands about as large as a ve&s;&s;el of 150 or 200 tons; from among which you will perceive the river's mouth; the opening between the&s;e i&s;lands is about 100 fathoms wide: there are &s;ome Spani&s;h pilots kept at <HI>Fort Balize,</HI> who give a very indifferent attendance; but if you &s;ee a launch coming out, you may depend on its being them, and your be&s;t way is to run directly for them, keeping off and on when you think your&s;elf too near.</P>
<P>If no launch come out, and the weather fine, come to an anchor, there is little or no danger, and if need the current will always carry you out again, provided you keep oppo&s;ite the channel.</P>
<P>In going up the river it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep within about 20 feet of the land, or of the drift wood that lies along it, except when you find it lodged on points or banks, in &s;uch places give it a rea&s;onable birth.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve al&s;o where you &s;ee the timber of a dwarfy and &s;hrubby growth, or where willows grow, on the points in &s;uch places the water is &s;hoal, and it is requi&s;ite to give the land a birth of about 100 feet.</P>

<P>For the better knowing of this coa&s;t, i &s;hall make &s;ome further remarks, becau&s;e the coa&s;t's running &s;o nearly E &amp; W, and being every where &s;o nearly alike in its level &amp; woody appearance; the mo&s;t &s;kilful and experienced pilot may here be deceived, e&s;pecially as the advantage of ob&s;erva|tions, which is &s;o great a help on a N &amp; S coa&s;t, fail here totally.</P>

<P>The bar of <HI>St. Ro&s;a</HI> only admits craft of 6 foot draught. As you come near this inlet or the ea&s;t end of <HI>St. Ro&s;a</HI> i&s;land, it is difficult to know that it is an i&s;land: the woods grow clo&s;e to the beach,

<P>THE northernmo&s;t inlet to this harbour is in lat. 26, 46 N; the &s;ure&s;t mark to find it by, is the clump or hommock of pine trees &s;tand|ing near the north end of the i&s;land, as mentioned page lxxvi; bring tho&s;e trees to bear E S E, and run in for them till you are in 15 foot water, which is the bar, then change your cour&s;e to E N E, and you will pre&s;ently deepen your water to 4, 5, 6, and even 10 fathom, with working room between the banks for a fleet; keep the north-breaker on board, and run in clo&s;e to the north &s;hore, which is the &s;outh end of <HI>Ga&s;parilla</HI> i&s;land, when in, you may pick your anchoring ground; but the bay is flat when in, and the further you go in the le&s;s water you will find.</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR ST. JOSEPH'S BAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE be&s;t way in coming either from the &s;outh|ward or we&s;tward, is to make the coa&s;t to the northward of Cape St. <HI>Blas,</HI> which lies in lat. 29, 42 N, about 10 miles from the cape, where you will find 6 or 7 fathom, within about 2 miles from the &s;hore, and 4 fathom within a mile or le&s;s. This coa&s;t is a narrow &s;lip of land, with &s;ome bu&s;hes and very few trees on it, it trenches N b W and S b E, up to the place i advi&s;e to make, and
<PB N="lxxxiii" REF="014440_0447_0F92618D241F48B0">
from there almo&s;t due N and S. At this place where it changes its direction, are two remarkable trees on a very narrow neck of land; the water in the bay may be &s;een in many places over this &s;lip of &s;trand. From the&s;e two trees you may coa&s;t it to the northward within a mile of the &s;hore; and when you have run about two miles you will &s;ee two more remarkable trees &s;tanding a little further in land; you will then continue a|bout a mile or a little more, and you will have the depth of 4 or 4&frac12; fathom water, but here a narrow &s;pit runs off for a mile, on which is only 12 foot, therefore keep your lead going, and when you once le&s;&s;en your depth to 3&frac12; fathom, draw off, &s;teering N W or W N W till you deepen again to 5 fathom&punc; you will then open a large red bluff on the main land in the N E quarter, bring the ea&s;t end of it to bear N E b N, and then run on that cour&s;e till you deepen your water to 6 fathom, and you will &s;ee two trees, one large the other &s;mall, clo&s;e together; to the ea&s;tward of the bluff &s;teer ea&s;tward till you bring the&s;e on with the ea&s;t end of the bluff, keep them &s;o and you will be in the be&s;t channel. In running on this cour&s;e about 2 miles or 2&frac12;, you will be on the bar, which has 17 foot water on it in &s;pring tides at low water; as &s;oon as you are on this bar hawl round to the ea&s;tward with an ea&s;y &s;weep, and you will pre&s;ently be in 5 or 6 fathom: by de|grees draw round to the &s;outhward, and you may anchor any where in that depth, near the we&s;t &s;hore. To know exactly when you are on the bar, take notice of four clumps of trees on the ea&s;tern &s;hore, and bring the third (counting from

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR PENSACOLA HARBOUR.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, as before directed, brought the highe&s;t or middlemo&s;t red cliff to bear N&frac14; E, you will &s;ee a clump of trees (in land) on with that part of the cliff, this is the be&s;t mark to lead you over the bar in the be&s;t water, being no le&s;s than 20 foot. When you are over the bar, you will have from 4 to 6 fathom within a cable's length and an half off the we&s;tern breakers; the&s;e &s;hew them&s;elves very plain in fine weather; and at their north end is a &s;mall dry &s;and bar.</P>
<P>When you are over the bar, run we&s;t till you bring the afore&s;aid trees in one with the hollow between the high cliff and the we&s;t cliff, by this means you will avoid the 10 foot bank before ta|ken notice of on page lxxiii.</P>
<P>To know when you are up with this bank, ob|&s;erve when you open the &s;traggling woods of <HI>Deer Point,</HI> with the we&s;t end of St. <HI>Ro&s;a</HI> i&s;land; when this mark is well open, you may hawl ea&s;tward for <HI>Tartar Point.</HI> Take care not to approach the &s;tarboard &s;hore nearer than 3&frac12; fathom, nor the lar|board &s;hore more than 4 fathom. In mid chan|nel you will have 5 or 6 fathom. The bottom is a regular hollow, therefore you may depend on your &s;oundings &s;hoaling gradually down to the above depths on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>In working up after you are within the 10 foot bank, keep the block-hou&s;e, or fort, open with St. <HI>Ro&s;a Point,</HI> by this means you are in no dan|ger

from the ten feet bank, and in &s;tanding north|ward keep <HI>Deer-point</HI> open with <HI>Tartar-point;</HI> off this la&s;t point you will have three fathom within le&s;s than a cable's length of the beech, in &s;tanding for St. <HI>Ro&s;a</HI> i&s;land, you have no danger but what is vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>After you have doubled <HI>Tartar-point,</HI> your cour&s;e up to town is NNE &frac12; E; mid channel you have 6 fathom, and it &s;hoals gradually down to 4 on each &s;ide; in beating up, come no nearer the we&s;t &s;hore than to bring a large white-hou&s;e (the highe&s;t in town) to bear NNE, and in &s;tand|ing over to the ea&s;t &s;hore, bring it no further we&s;t than N &frac12; W; this hou&s;e was the government hou&s;e, and &s;tands at the ea&s;t end of the garri&s;on.

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR MOBILE BAR.</HEAD>
<P>IN going we&s;tward from <HI>Pen&s;acola,</HI> come no nearer than within 5 miles from <HI>Mobile-point,</HI> and when that bears N, run till you bring the ea&s;t end of the <HI>Sand-key</HI> to bear N 27&deg;: W in one with the ea&s;t end of <HI>Dauphin-i&s;land;</HI> then you will be on the bar in 13 or 14 feet, run up on &s;aid cour&s;e, and you will &s;oon have 18, 24, 30, 40 feet; the bar is &s;hort: continue to go &s;o till you are abrea&s;t &amp; pretty near the <HI>Sand-Key,</HI> then haul up N &frac34; E, and run in, ob&s;erving not to borrow too nigh on the &s;tarboard breakers; after you are abrea&s;t <HI>Mobile-point,</HI> you may gradually haul up more ea&s;tward; then bring the point to
<PB N="lxxxvi" REF="014440_0452_0F926193771A7200">
bear about SW, or SWbS 2 or 2&frac12; miles off, and you may anchor in from 3 to 4&frac12; fathom depth. Or you may bring the &s;outh end of the &s;and key ju&s;t &s;hut in with the S E end of <HI>Pelican</HI> key, and run in till you are in 15 foot, which is the bar; then &s;teer W, or W &frac12; N, till you bring the fir&s;t-mentioned marks on, &amp; run in as before directed: This way is deeper, but not &s;o certain.</P>
<P>There are two &s;watches thro' the ea&s;t breaker, and the old harbour (which according to <HI>Charlevo|ix,</HI> was ruined by an earthquake) lies back of <HI>Pe|lican I&s;land,</HI> and the we&s;t breaker; the draught ex|plains them. On &s;hore, are the ruins of the <HI>French</HI> &s;ettlement, which formerly was on that i&s;land; what is left mo&s;t perfect, is the remains of a guard-hou&s;e, in the &s;and-hills, and a remnant of a &s;alt-work on the beach, all the re&s;t has been &s;wallowed by the &s;ea; after great &s;torms, it is not uncommon to find numbers of human bones at this place. Being got into this bay, the way up to town is ea&s;y, but the whole of the way is &s;hallow, no where exceeding 16 feet; there are no &s;hallows, except between Point <HI>Claire</HI> and <HI>Roebuck</HI> river; where is an oy&s;ter-bank, which is ea&s;ily a|voided by keeping neare&s;t to the larboard or we&s;t &s;hore.</P>
<P>Having been pretty explicit about the tides on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, it may naturally be expected that i &s;hould &s;ay as much about the tides in the <HI>Gulph</HI> of <HI>Mexico;</HI> but little or nothing can be &s;aid about &s;o un&s;table a matter, from <HI>Sandy-Key</HI> and <HI>Sandy-Point,</HI> or <HI>Punta Tancha,</HI> through the whole bay of <HI>Juan Ponce de Leon,</HI> up as far as <HI>Punta Lar|go</HI> or <HI>Cape-Roman,</HI> it runs tide and half tide in the

<P>There is a con&s;tant current in the open <HI>Gulph,</HI> &s;etting ESE, or thereabouts, at the rate of 1 or 1&frac12; knot per hour, of which all ob&s;erving people coming through that &s;ea are very &s;oon &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age to the ea&s;tward of the <HI>Tortugas,</HI> is to be depended upon as laid down in my maps; coming through it from the northward, you will

<P>Be&s;ides this rea&s;on for &s;tanding longer off than in, there is one &s;till greater. Every experienced mariner knows, that a ve&s;&s;el will run a di&s;tance towards &s;hore in much le&s;s time, than &s;he can run the &s;ame di&s;tance from it; and that the higher the land is &s;he works under, the quicker &s;he runs in, con&s;equently the &s;lower off; hence almo&s;t e|very one in beating upon a lee-&s;hore, will &s;tand out a longer time than in; but few even among the mo&s;t experienced know the philo&s;ophy of this <HI>phaenomenon,</HI> again&s;t which they &s;o carefully guard. It is that great law of nature whereby all light bodies mu&s;t fall on the heavier ones, i mean ATTRACTION. To explain this by an ex|periment, take any ve&s;&s;el, fill it almo&s;t with wa|ter, put a cork or chip in it, while that remains in the center, it is attracted from ever &s;ide alike, and therefore &s;tands fixed, but no &s;ooner is it thrown out of the center, than it will begin to approach the &s;ide, and as it draws near, attracti|on is increa&s;ed, till at la&s;t the velocity of the chip becomes &s;o great, as to run with a con&s;iderable violence again&s;t the ve&s;&s;el, where it remains fixed; and if it is an oblong piece in &s;hape of a ve&s;&s;el, the &s;ame will happen, as when a &s;hip runs a&s;hore &s;tem on, viz. it will wind broad-&s;ide too. The explanation of this affair, i am indebted for to the

<P>At the fir&s;t planning of this publication, it was in|tended only to be a &s;ingle volume, not exceeding <HI>300</HI> pages, <HI>appendix</HI> and all; but at the reque&s;t of &s;ome Gentlemen, my friends, i have &s;ubjoined &s;o many ar|ticles, that it &s;welled imperceptibly to about <HI>800</HI> pages, which made it nece&s;&s;ary to print it in two volumes; and as &s;ome unexpected accidents, e&s;pecially the want of a copper-plate printer, have occa&s;ioned delays; i will therefore, to atone in &s;ome mea&s;ure (for &s;aid de|lays) to tho&s;e kind Gentlemen who favoured me with their &s;ub&s;criptions for the maps, deliver them the &s;e|cond volume <HI>gratis,</HI> as &s;oon as it is publi&s;hed: It is now in the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>I return my mo&s;t &s;incere thanks for the liberal en|couragement that has been afforded me; and hope my work will be deemed de&s;erving it.</P>
