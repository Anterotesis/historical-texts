<HEAD><HI>A</HI> PROTEST, Pre&s;ented to the HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY, By the Sub&s;cribers, at the Clo&s;e of the late Debate there, concerning the &s;ending MR. FRANKLIN As an A&s;&s;i&s;tant to our AGENT, at the Court of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_WE who&s;e Names are hereunto &s;ub&s;cribed, do object and <HI>prote&s;t</HI> again&s;t the Appointment of the Per&s;on propo&s;ed as an Agent of this Province, for the following rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> Becau&s;e we believe him to be the Chief Author of the Mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by the late A&s;&s;embly, which have occa&s;ioned &s;uch Unea&s;ine&s;s and De&s;traction among the good People of this Province.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> Becau&s;e we believe his fixed enmity to the Pro|prietors will preclude all Accommodations of our Di&s;putes with them, even on ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Terms;&mdash;So that for the&s;e two Rea&s;ons, we are filled with the mo&s;t affecting Ap|prehen&s;ions, that the Petitions lately tran&s;mitted to England, will be made u&s;e of to produce a Change of Government, contrary to the Intention of the Petitioners; the greate&s;t part of whom, we are per&s;uaded, only de&s;igned thereby to obtain a Compliance with &s;ome equitable Demands.&mdash;And thus, by &s;uch an Appointment, we, and a va&s;t Number of our mo&s;t worthy Con&s;tituents, are deprived of all hopes of ever &s;eeing an End put to the fatal Di&s;&s;entions of our Country; it be|ing our firm Opinion, that any further Pro&s;ecution of the Mea&s;ures for a Change of Government at this Time, will lay the Foundations of uncea&s;ing Feuds, and all the Mi&s;eries of Confu&s;ion, among the People we repre&s;ent, and their Po&s;|terity.&mdash;This &s;tep gives us the more lively Affliction, as it is taken at the very Moment, when we are informed by a Member of this Hou&s;e, that the Governor has a&s;&s;ured him of his having received In&s;tructions from the Proprietors, on their hearing of our late Di&s;pute, to give his A&s;&s;ent to the Taxati|on of their E&s;tates in the &s;ame manner that the E&s;tates of o|ther Per&s;ons are to be taxed, and al&s;o to confirm, for the Public u&s;e, the &s;everal <HI>Squares,</HI> formerly claimed by the City; On which Subjects, we make no doubt, the Governor would have &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e, if this had been the u&s;ual Time of doing Bu&s;ine&s;s, and he had not been nece&s;&s;arily ab|&s;ent to meet the A&s;&s;embly of the lower Counties.&mdash;And therefore we cannot but anxiou&s;ly regret that, at a Time when the Proprietors have &s;hewn &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition, this Hou&s;e &s;hould not endeavour to cultivate the &s;ame, and ob|tain from them every rea&s;onable Demand that can be made on the part of the People, in vigorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ting on which, we would mo&s;t earne&s;tly unite with the re&s;t of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> Becau&s;e the Gentleman propo&s;ed, we are informed, is very unfavourably thought of by &s;everal of his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters; and we are humbly of Opinion, that it will be di&s;re&s;pectful to our mo&s;t Gracious Sovereign, and di&s;advan|tageous to our&s;elves and our con&s;tituents, to employ &s;uch a Per&s;on as an Agent.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> Becau&s;e the Propo&s;al of the Per&s;on mentioned, is &s;o extremely di&s;agreeable to a very great Number of the mo&s;t &s;erious and reputable inhabitants of this Province of all Denominations and Societies (one Proof of which is, his ha|ving been rejected, both by this City and County at the la&s;t Election, though he had repre&s;ented the former in A&s;&s;embly for 14 Years that we are convinced no Mea&s;ure this Hou&s;e can adopt, will tend &s;o much to inflame the Re&s;entments and im|bitter the Divi&s;ions of the good People of this Province, as his appointment to be our Agent&mdash;And we cannot but &s;in|cerely lament, that the Peace and Happine&s;s of Penn&s;ylvania &s;hould be &s;acrificed for the Promotion of a Man, who cannot be advanced but by the Convul&s;ions of his Country.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> Becau&s;e the unnece&s;&s;ary ha&s;te with which this Hou&s;e has acted in proceeding to this Appointment (without making a &s;mall Adjournment, tho' reque&s;ted by many Mem|bers, to con&s;ult our Con&s;tituents on the Matters to be decided, and) even before their Speaker has been pre&s;ented to the King's Repre&s;entative, tho' we are informed that the Gover|nor will be in Town the Beginning of next Week;&mdash;may &s;ubject us to the Cen&s;ures and very heavy Di&s;plea&s;ure of our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign and his Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> Becau&s;e the Gentleman propos'd, has heretofore ventured, contrary to an Act of A&s;&s;embly, to place the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Money here meant was a Sum granted by Parliament as an Indemnification for part of our Expences in the late War, which by Act of A&s;&s;embly was ordered for its better Secu|rity to be placed in the Bank.</NOTE> pub|lic Money in the Stocks, whereby this Province &s;uffered a lo&s;s of &pound;.6000; and that Sum, added to &pound;.5000 granted for his Expences, makes the whole Co&s;t of his former Voyage to England, amount to ELEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS; which expen&s;ive kind of Agency we do not chu&s;e to imitate, and burden the Public with unnece&s;&s;ary loads of Debt. For the&s;e and other Rea&s;ons we &s;hould think our&s;elves guilty of betray|ing the Rights of Penn&s;ylvania, if we &s;hould pre&s;umptuou&s;ly commit them to the Di&s;cretion of a Man, again&s;t whom &s;o many and ju&s;t Objections pre&s;ent them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly.</HI> We being extremely de&s;irous to avert the Mi&s;|chiefs apprehended from the intended Appointment, and as much as in us lies to promote Peace and Unanimity among us and our Con&s;tituents, do humbly propo&s;e to the Hou&s;e, that if they will agree regularly to appoint any <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Fothergill was mentioned by the Sub&s;cribers as a pro|per Per&s;on.</NOTE> Gentlemen of Integrity, Abilities, and Knowledge in England, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. Jack&s;on as our Agent, under a Re&s;triction not to pre&s;ent the Petitions for a Change of our Government, or any of them, to the King or his Mini&s;ters, unle&s;s an expre&s;s Order for that Purpo&s;e be hereafter given by the A&s;&s;embly of this Province; we will not give it any Oppo&s;ition: But if &s;uch an Appointment &s;hould be made, we mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t (as we cannot think it a nece&s;&s;ary one) that our Con&s;tituents, already la|bouring under heavy Debts, be not burthened with fre&s;h Im|po&s;itions on that Account; and therefore, in Conde&s;cen&s;ion to the Members, who think another Agent nece&s;&s;ary, we will concur with them, if they approve of this Propo&s;al, in pay|ing &s;uch Agent at our own Expence.</P>
