<P>The fir&s;t draught of it was only a ver&s;ification of the oeconomy: but the author having &s;ince con&s;i|derably enlarged it without regarding the original, it cannot be called in it's pre&s;ent &s;tate a ver&s;ification. And even the title it now bears "A PARAPHRASE" does not properly belong to it: for th&ocirc;, in &s;ome parts of it, it may be a paraphra&s;e; in other parts, the matter is not the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It is called "a paraphra&s;e" for want of a more &s;uitable title; and to &s;hew not only, what it had it's ri&s;e from; but, the author's obligations to "the oeconomy".</P>
