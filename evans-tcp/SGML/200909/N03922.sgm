<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Do here pre&s;ent you with that <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> which I delivered unto you, upon the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Death</HI> of One of your <HI>Contempora|ries</HI> by that fatal Sickne&s;s (as we &s;uppo&s;ed) of the <HI>Throat-Di&s;temper;</HI> and which you &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired might be made Publick.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it was with &s;ome <HI>Diffi|culty,</HI> I brought my &s;elf to be willing to &s;uffer this Di&s;cour&s;e to appear in Print, as thinking, that it wanted many <HI>Ornaments,</HI> to render it acceptable, nor was well eno' <HI>Labour'd</HI> to be made publick; and there were already many

<P>But then, when I con&s;idered the particular <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> of this Di&s;cour&s;e, I was fain to own it was yours; and dare not deny you the U&s;e and Improvement of it. It was at your <HI>Motion</HI> &amp; <HI>De&s;ire,</HI> that at <HI>that Time,</HI> I made a Di&s;cour&s;e to you: The Circum|&s;tances of the Time were &s;uch, that I could not but be plea&s;ed with the Motion; it &s;eem'd as if there was the Hand of Heaven in it; I could not but think my &s;elf obliged from Duty to comply with the Motion. And as God was plea&s;ed to make the Di&s;cour&s;e <HI>Acceptable</HI> to you, and you &s;till asked my Con&s;ent for the Publication of it, <HI>for your further U&s;e and Im|provement,</HI> it &s;eem'd as if Providence made it my Duty, &s;till to comply: I could not con|&s;ider my &s;elf as your Servant, in the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t and your Souls, and not own my Ob|ligation to gratify You.</P>
<P>Such therefore, as it is, a Serious, Plain Di&s;cour&s;e, de&s;igned for the Benefit <HI>of Youthful Auditors,</HI> de&s;titute of the Ornaments of a beautiful Stile or any well &s;tudied Method, it is offered unto you.</P>

<P>GOD forbid then, that any of You, who have <HI>&V;rged</HI> the Publication of this for your <HI>Improvement,</HI> as tho' you were re&s;olved to make a good U&s;e of it, &s;hould &s;till, after the Reading of it, be found walking in the Ways of a car|nal Heart, plea&s;ing your &s;elves in the danger|ous Paths of Sin, &s;aying, <HI>You &s;hall have Peace, though you walk in the Imagination of your Hearts, to add</HI> Sin to Sin.</P>

<P>ISHALL not make any <HI>Apology</HI> here, for <HI>Appearing</HI> thus in <HI>Publick,</HI> nor any <HI>Excu&s;e</HI> for my <HI>Method, Weakne&s;s, Deficiencies, &amp;c.</HI> I only purpose to give a brief <HI>Account</HI> of the <HI>Oc|ca&s;ion</HI> of it; which a Stranger will find alluded to in the Di&s;cour&s;e, but not be thoroughly acquainted with.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t be a Stranger indeed in the&s;e Parts of the World, who hath not heard of the <HI>De&s;olations</HI> made in &s;undry Parts of the Country, by that Di&s;temper, that is u&s;ually called, The <HI>Throat-Di&s;temper.</HI></P>
<P>Near Five Years ago, we in this Pari&s;h were <HI>Vi&s;ited</HI> with the &s;ame; and &s;undry very plea&s;ant and hopeful Young Per&s;ons were taken away.</P>
<P>Since which Time, we have had an Account of more <HI>awful De&s;olations</HI> made by it, in many <HI>Other Places.</HI></P>
<P>Near the Latter End of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, a very hope|ful, &s;erious and likely Young Per&s;on, Named
<PB REF="004829_0006_100DFCFCFB19C6A8"><HI>Prudence Bi&s;hop,</HI> the Elde&s;t Daughter of Mr. <HI>John Bi&s;hop,</HI> was taken <HI>Sick</HI> among&s;t us; At fir&s;t indeed, we hoped, that her Sickne&s;s might be only a hard Cold, a common &s;ore Throat attended with a Feaver, Or the Effects of the Ra&s;h, as we called a Di&s;temper, that was then among us.</P>
<P>But her Sickne&s;s pre&s;ently increa&s;ed, and &s;he was brought into uncommon Difficulty and Di&s;tre&s;s. The ju&s;tly <HI>Famous and well known Phy&s;ician</HI> of the&s;e Parts was con&s;ulted; who judged her <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> to be the <HI>Throat-Di&s;temper.</HI> And to be &s;hort, the Di&s;temper made <HI>Quick</HI> Work and carried her off, <HI>Augu&s;t 2d,</HI> and her Corps was interred on Lords-Day, <HI>Augu&s;t 3d.</HI></P>
<P>This Young Per&s;on gave us Ground to hope, that the Lord had been merciful to her Soul; begun and carried on a good Work of Grace in her: &s;o that we could hope, that <HI>for ther to die was Gain:</HI> But then, it &s;eem'd a dark <HI>Omen</HI> to the <HI>Living,</HI> and a loud <HI>Warning</HI> to our <HI>Surviving</HI> Youth <HI>to be al&s;o ready.</HI></P>
<P>Before this happened, our Young People had agreed among Them&s;elves, to Meet together on Tue&s;day, the <HI>Fifth Day of Augu&s;t,</HI> for Youthful <HI>Diver&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Recreation;</HI> Or to u&s;e their own <HI>Terms,</HI> had agreed it &s;hould be a Day of <HI>Fro|licking</HI> among Them.</P>
<P><PB REF="004829_0007_100DFCFEBB4E1160">
But Struck with this <HI>Sudden Death</HI> of one of their Number, and Alarumed with the Thought of &s;uch a <HI>Sweeping Di&s;temper</HI>'s Entring the Place <HI>the Second Time,</HI> Many of them get together at the Funeral, and agree to <HI>de&s;ire</HI> me to give them an <HI>Exhortation,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of God, on &s;aid Tue&s;day, <HI>before intended for Mirth and Di|ver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Accordingly,</HI> On the Evening following the Sabbath, &s;ome appointed by the Re&s;t came, and informed me of their De&s;ign of <HI>Turning their Meeting,</HI> before de&s;igned for Diver&s;ion, <HI>into a Religious Meeting;</HI> and de&s;ired my <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> and a Word of <HI>Exhortation:</HI></P>

<P><HI>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the People not be afraid? Shall there be Evil in a City, and the LORD hath not done it?</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SO great is the Corruption, and De|pravedne&s;s of the Humane Nature, that a &s;pirit of Vanity and Sin, and an Inclination to depart from the Living GOD, are become natural to Men.</P>
<P>Hence, perhaps there hath not been found any Nation or people, of any long Standing upon the Face of the Earth, who have not run &s;uch a length in Sin and Wickedne&s;s, and &s;o increa&s;ed their Iniquities, as to render it nece&s;&s;ary, for the Vindication of the Divine Providence and Perfections, that awful Judg|ments be &s;ent upon them, to be Te&s;timonies from Heaven for GOD, and again&s;t impious bla&s;pheming Mortals.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004829_0008_100DFD01072BD4A8">
Indeed GOD is abundantly, yea infinitely good; he is kind to the rebellious Nations, and doth not at once <HI>&s;tir up all his Wrath.</HI> But yet, if he &s;pares for the Pre&s;ent, and <HI>being full of Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> does not &s;peedily rai&s;e up Him|&s;elf to de&s;troy them, he doth not forget their Wickedne&s;s and Sins, but writes them down in his Book; and when their Iniquities are ripe, he will vi&s;it their Sin upon Them. <HI>Exod. xxxii.</HI> 34.</P>
<P>So the Prophet Amos in the Name of the LORD, a&s;&s;ures the great and populous King|doms, which then were famous in the World, that they had Iniquities remembred by GOD, that mu&s;t, when they had filled up their Mea|&s;ure, be puni&s;hed upon them. See <HI>Chap. i</HI> &amp; <HI>ii.</HI></P>
<P>Judah and I&s;rael, tho' they were the pecu|liar People of God, the &s;ingularly favoured of Heaven, have their Sins remembred before GOD, as well as the Other Nations; and &s;o might expect that a Woe-Day would &s;ooner or later come upon them, <HI>Chap. ii.</HI> 4&mdash;8. Yea, the Sins of The&s;e e&s;pecially needed to be puni&s;hed upon Them: For GOD had done more for them than Others; laid them under &s;tronger Obligations: So that their Sins were attended with very aggravating Circum&s;tan|ces; &s;hewed more Ingratitude, Unkindne&s;s and Stubbornne&s;s; were greater Affronts to an indulgent Heaven, <HI>Chap. ii.</HI> 9&mdash;13.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004829_0008_100DFD01072BD4A8">
The Prophet, in our Context, in the Name of the LORD, declares the Nece&s;&s;ity and Certainty of GOD's Judgments again&s;t his own back&s;lidden and greatly provoking People of I&s;rael; tells them, that as GOD hath been e&s;pecially good to them, &s;o their Sins e&s;pe|cially call for Puni&s;hment; as he had peculiarly undertook the Care &amp; Government of them, and made them in a peculiar Manner his own Family, &s;o it was but congruous and fitting, that he &s;hould &s;ee the Laws of his Family executed upon Them; correct them for their Offences, and puni&s;h them for their Iniqui|ties, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. 'Tis indeed nece&s;&s;ary, that they be for&s;aken and left of God, and given up to Mi&s;ery and Evil, when their Ways are con|trary and provoking to God; when they de&s;pi&s;e his Laws, and give him no becoming Reverence and Glory, <HI>ver.</HI> 3. <HI>Can Two walk together, except they be agreed?</HI> Can any Two walk together, and &s;o have Communion and Fellow&s;hip one with the Other, when they are not enough of one mind to walk the &s;ame Way, or take the &s;ame Cour&s;e? The Similitude is ea&s;ily applied; when GOD and his People are contrary one to the other, there is no Communion between them: In this Ca&s;e, as they walk contrary to GOD, &s;o he to them; and that implies his For&s;aking and Puni&s;hing them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004829_0009_100DFD0329D33EB0">
And as 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that they be puni&s;hed for their Iniquities, &s;o 'tis certain, that the LORD is offended, and about to puni&s;h them; And therefore they may be &s;ure, that there are Sins found with them, rendring this nece&s;|&s;ary. <HI>A Lion will not roar in the Fore&s;t,</HI> nor <HI>a young Lion cry out of his Den,</HI> for Nothing; <HI>a Bird is not caught without &s;ome Sanre or Gin; and no Man will think it worth his while to take up a Snare that has taken Nothing:</HI> In every one of the&s;e In&s;tances, whither a Lion's Roaring, a Young Lion's Crying, a Bird's being caught, or a Snare taken from the Earth, there is &s;ome Rea&s;on and Occa&s;ion for the &s;ame, <HI>ver.</HI> 4, 5. In which the Prophet &s;eems to lead us to con|&s;ider, that there is Nothing done by the De|&s;ign of any Agent, without &s;ome Rea&s;on or moving Occa&s;ion: And his Intention doubt|le&s;s is, to convince us, that God does not threaten, nor &s;end his Judgments for Nothing, or without any Cau&s;e: So that, if God utters his Voice, brings any Judgments upon a Peo|ple, they may Konw, that there is &s;ome Rea|&s;on therefore; God is offended, and is about to puni&s;h them for their Iniquities; and that therefore it becometh them to <HI>prepare to meet God.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ame Thing, the Prophet in a mo&s;t convincing Way, further in&s;i&s;ts upon in our Text: <HI>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="004829_0009_100DFD0329D33EB0"><HI>the People not be afraid? Shall there be Evil in City, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the People not be afraid?</HI> Shall there be an Alarum given, and the People take no Notice, nor be concerred? When a Trumpet is &s;ounded for &s;uch an End, men conclude there is Danger; their Hearts are pre&s;ently filled with Fear; they conclude there is not this Warning for Nothing The De&s;ign and Application of this is ea&s;ily &s;een, <HI>viz.</HI> That if God has &s;ounded his Trumpet, given an Alarum, there is good Rea&s;on to conclude it is not for No|thing; but he warns us that he is coming forth in the Way of his Judgments; and it concerns us to be ready to meet Him.</P>
<P>But perhaps this would not be convincing to &s;ome, except they better under&s;tood what Alarum was given by God, or what Trumpet of the Lord had been blown among&s;t them: They had heard, perhaps they would &s;ay, No Voice from Heaven; knew not of any War|ning God had given them that might be com|pared to a Trumpet &s;ounding an Alarm.</P>
<P>To inform the Minds of &s;uch, and fa&s;ten the Conviction, 'tis added, <HI>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the LORD hath not done it?</HI> Shall there be any Judgments in the City, any Ca|lamities, and the LORD not have a Hand in
<PB N="6" REF="004829_0010_100DFD04CFC22630">the &s;ame? If there be Evils, any &s;ore Afflicti|ons, or any terrible Providences, are not the&s;e the Doings of the LORD? By the&s;e God ut|ters his Voice, warns and threatens you.</P>
<P>From which Words thus opened, we may gather the&s;e Things as plainly implied and in|&s;inuated in them, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>I.</HI> That GOD hath an holy Hand in all the Judgments, brought upon us or our Friends: <HI>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the LORD hath not done it?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>II.</HI> That one End of GOD's Judgments, is, to be the Warning of a People: They are com|pared to a Trumpet &s;ounded for an Alarum.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>III.</HI> That it is the Duty of All, when GOD warns them in the Way of his Providence, to take the Warning, hear the Voice, fear the Danger, and endeavour to E&s;cape it: The Simile made u&s;e of and improved upon this Occa&s;ion, plainly teacheth us, that as a People, who hear the Trumpet &s;ounding an Alarm, fearing the Danger betake them&s;elves to their Arms or Forts &s;o &s;hould a People take War|ning by the Trumpet of the LORD; be afraid of approaching Danger, and prepare to meet Him.</ITEM>

<P>The&s;e Things, we purpo&s;e at this Time, to con&s;ider, as &s;o many Doctrinal Propo&s;itions.</P>

I. <HI>GOD hath an holy Hand in all the Judg|ments, brought upon us or our Friends.</HI> Nothing is more Evident, than that the &s;ame Almighty Being, who at fir&s;t commanded the univer&s;al World to exi&s;t, exerci&s;eth a Providence over the World he hath made This may be proved from the Perfections of the Deity, from the nece&s;&s;ary Dependence of the Creature upon the Creator, from the continued Harmony and Order in the Vi&s;ible World, and from Tokens of the Pre&s;ence &amp; over-ruling Power of GOD in Providences that happen:</P>
<P>But at this Time, it is not our De&s;ign to offer Proofs for a Divine Providence; but to con&s;ider the Exten&s;ivene&s;s of GOD's Provi|dence.</P>
<P>Many allow that GOD exerci&s;eth a Provi|dence in the World, who yet have but &s;tingy Tho'ts of his Providence: They allow, that he beholds the Children of Men from the Ha|bitation of his Throne; takes Notice how Things are managed in the World; doth Good to his Friends; yea, is kind to his Ene|mies, <HI>to the Evil and Vnthankful;</HI> &s;ometimes al&s;o, he frowns upon the Workers of Iniquity: They look for a Time al&s;o, when he will gloriou&s;ly reward his Friends with immortal Ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;purn his Enemies from his Pre|&s;ence into outer Darkne&s;s and everla&s;ting Hor|rors

<P>But, if we well con&s;ider Things, we &s;hall find the Providence of GOD to be more exten&s;ive than &s;uch imagine; yea that it extends to all Things, and all the Accidents and Circum&s;tan|ces attending Them. What we call natural or &s;econd Cau&s;es, are conducted and influenced by GOD's Providence: 'Tis by his Provi|dence, that the regular Returns of Day and Night, and the Succe&s;&s;ions of Summer and Winter are made.

<P N="2">II. That <HI>One End of</HI> GOD's <HI>Judgments, is, to be the Warning of a People.</HI></P>
<P>The Judgments of GOD may be con&s;idered as his awakening Voice to a &s;tupid World: They are Signs or Effects and Fruits of his Anger again&s;t Sin; Tokens from GOD that Sin &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle makes the Judgments of GOD brought upon any, even in di&s;tant Ages, that come to our Ears, to be our <HI>Examples,</HI> and <HI>de|&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned for our Admonition,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor. x.</HI> 6, 7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So the Apo&s;tle Jude makes the Fall and Mi&s;ery of the Angels to be Warnings to us, <HI>Jude,</HI> 5, 6, And tells us, <HI>That Sodom and Gomor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ha, and the Cities about them, are &s;et forth for an Example, &s;uffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire, ver.</HI> 7. So the Apo&s;tle Peter repre&s;ents <HI>the Bringing in the Flood of old upon the World,</HI> to be a Warning to all that hear of the &s;ame, 2 <HI>Pet. ii.</HI> 5, 6.</P>
<P>And, if the Judgments of GOD, that we hear of in &s;uch di&s;tant Ages, have &s;uch a &s;peak|ing Voice, how much more the Judgments of GOD that are ju&s;t at Hand, and fall within our Sight? Mo&s;es &s;eem'd to think, that the Judg|ments of GOD, that fall out within the Sight
<PB N="11" REF="004829_0012_100DFD09B3285FE0">and Knowlege of Any, have a clearer Voice than tho&s;e we hear to have been in di&s;tant A|ges, <HI>Deut. ii.</HI> 2,&mdash;7 <HI>Know ye this Day: for I &s;peak not with your Children which have not known and which have not &s;een the Cha&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;oment of the LORD your</HI> GOD, <HI>&amp;c..... But your Eyes have &s;een all the great Acts of the LORD, which he did.</HI></P>
<P>GOD's Judgments then, that overtake us, in our Per&s;ons, Families or Friends, are a loud Warning to us of the Danger of Abiding in Sin, and of the Nece&s;&s;ity of hiding our &s;elves under the Wings of the ALMIGHTY, before the Floods of Divine Indignation come upon us. Thus GOD's Judgments are called <HI>his Voice crying unto the City, Mic. vi.</HI> 9. Thus the Pro|phet repre&s;ents the Mo&s;t HIGH, as uttering a mighty Voice, and &s;peaking very loud to Men in the Way of his Judgments; <HI>Jer. xxv.</HI> 29, 30, 31. <HI>Lo, I begin to bring Evil on the City which is called by my Name, and &s;hould ye be utterly unpuni&s;hed? Ye &s;hall not be unpuni&s;hed,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>There|fore prophe&s;ie, and &s;ay unto them, The</HI> LORD <HI>&s;hall rore from on High, and utter his Voice from his holy Habitation,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>We come now to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="3">III. That <HI>it is the Duty of All, when GOD warns them in the Way of his Providence, to take the Warning, hear the Voice, fear the Danger,</HI> and <HI>endeavour to e&s;cape it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004829_0013_100DFD0C03615B40">
<HI>When GOD's Judgments are in the Earth, the Inhabitants of the World &s;hould &s;ee, and learn Righ|teou&s;ne&s;, I&s;a. xxvi.</HI> 9, 10, 11. When the LORD's Voice cryeth to the City, <HI>the Man of Wi&s;dom will hear, Mic. vi</HI> 9. If GOD &s;ends his Judg|ments, for this End, <HI>Namely,</HI> to be a Warning to a carele&s;s World, it is evident, that Sin will lie at the Door of tho&s;e, that receive not Warning: For we then only comply with the De&s;ign of God in his Judgments, when we con|&s;ider his Hand, hearken to his Voice, and do our be&s;t to be ready to meet him, that we may e&s;cape the &s;everer Judgments of Heaven, and be hid in the Day of the LORD's Anger.</P>
<P>Indeed, this Propo&s;ition is &s;o evident from what has been offered under the fore-going and from the End and De&s;ign of GOD's Judgments, that I need not detain you to offer any Thing more in Confirmation of it: For &s;hall GOD him&s;elf give us Warning, and we not think out|&s;elves obliged to receive it?

<HEAD>USE, I. Of INFORMATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Is it as we have beard; that GOD hath an holy Hand in all the Judgments, brought upon us, or our Friends? <HI>Are all the Sorrows and Evils in the World directed and over-ruled by him? Then we may infer, that tho&s;e who have GOD engaged for Them, and are &s;ecure of his Favour, are &s;afe in the &s;addest Times; and therefore we may with Hope and Security, commend our &s;elves and Circum&s;tances to GOD in W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll doing in the mo&s;t difficult Times.</HI> The Face of Providence is &s;ome Times over&s;pread with Clouds and Darkne&s;s; <HI>the Eyes of Many mourn by rea&s;on of Affliction:</HI> Terrors and pe&s;tilential Arrows flie by Night, and <HI>De&s;truction wasteth at No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|Day.</HI> There &s;eemeth to be Di&s;tre&s;s on every Hand; there is De&s;olation within doors, and Fear without; Abroad one Calamity prevails, and another as dreadful at Home.</P>
<P>But in &s;uch dark Times, there is this for the People of GOD to live upon, and comfort their weeping Hearts in the Con&s;ideration of, <HI>even,</HI> that <HI>the LORD reigneth, who rideth upon the Heaven in the Help of his People, and in his Ex|cellency on the Sky.</HI> He over-rules all, <HI>Ju&s;tice and Judgment are the Habitation of who&s;e Throne;

<P N="2">2 Is it as we have heard, that one End of GOD's Judgments is, to be the Warning of a People? <HI>If then there be Judgments amongst us, or round about us, we learn what Interpretation to make of the &s;ame.</HI> By Them GOD gives us Notice, What <HI>he will do unto us</HI> if we are found in the Ways of Sin, and return not to him: <HI>And becau&s;e he will do this unto us,</HI> hereby de&s;igns to excite us <HI>to prepare to meet our GOD; to &s;eek Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Meekne&s;s, before the Decree brong Forth, before the fierce Anger of the</HI> LORD <HI>come upon us.</HI></P>
<P>GOD being infinitely good, and delighting in Mercy, mo&s;t frequently &s;ends his awakening Judgments, before he proceeds to the Utmo&s;t agai&s;t Men; He warns them, and gives them a Space for Repentance. He &s;omtimes vi&s;its with awful and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Sickne&s;s; &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the de&s;troying Angel, and takes away &s;ome as a Warning to the Re&s;t.

<P><PB N="16" REF="004829_0015_100DFD0F96427898">
If then any awful Sickne&s;s, any &s;ore Judge|ment is &s;ent among&s;t us, we may rea&s;onably conclude that GOD is giving of us Warning to prepare for all Evens and be ready to meet Him, in what Way &s;oever he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to come unto us.</P>

<P>And what mu&s;t be done, why &s;hall we not endeavour to do it now? E&s;pecially, con&s;ider|ing,
<PB N="31" REF="004829_0022_100DFD202CF82560">that we &s;ahll never have a better Time?

<P>Young People are &s;trangely apt to imagine a <HI>more convenisent Sea&s;on</HI> before them; but 'tis a Delu&s;ion, and ungrounded Imagination. The Time of Youth is really the be&s;t Time for this Work.</P>
<P>GOD directs his Offers of Mercy particu|larly to Young Per&s;ons: He calls to them in a partcular Manner to come and partake of his Love; <HI>Pa&s;al. xxxiv.</HI> 11. <HI>Come, ye Children, hearken unto me, &amp;c.</HI> See al&s;o <HI>Eccl.xii.</HI> 1. <HI>Remem|ber now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is a &s;pecial encouragement given to Yourth, that, if they apply them&s;elves to &s;eek the LORD, they &s;hall &s;peed; <HI>Prov. viii.</HI> 17,&mdash; <HI>Tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, GOD hath manife&s;ted how plea&s;ed he is, when Per&s;ons in Earne&s;t &s;eek him in their Youth. Remember the In&s;tances of Samuel and Jo&s;iah, who &s;ought the LORD when they were Young; what gracious Re&s;|pects

<P>Be&s;ides, there is not &s;o much contracted Ob&s;tinacy in the Hearts of Youth, as in tho&s;e of more advanced Years. Not but that they have natural Corruption and Principles of Sin in them, as well as Others; and Hearts &s;o hard, as to need an Omnipotent Power to &s;often the &s;ame. But yet there is an incerea&s;ing Ob&s;tinacy in the Hearts of Men; and Young Per&s;ons have not made &s;uch Advances in it, as by longer Continuance in Sin, they will arrive unto. But then by every Day's continuance in Sin, this will increa&s;e upon Them; the Heart will grow more harden'd again&s;t the Coun&s;els of Grace, more &s;et again&s;t Religion and aver&s;e to a Compliance with the Term of Peace; Repentance will become more diffi|cult and Hazardous: <HI>Jer xiii 23. Can the E|thiopian change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? then may ye al&s;o do Good, that are accu&s;tomed to do Evil.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> the Encumbrances of Life increa&s;e upon Per&s;ons, as they increa&s;e in Years. You will likely have more worldly Cares and Con|cerns, to call off your Minds from the Care of your Souls afterwards, if your Day in the World be leng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h'ned out, than you have now.

<P>Nor may we expect to be freer from Temp|tation to delay, and put off this Work of Re|pentance, hereafter than now. There will be as many Temptations hereafter, &s;till to put off, without any doubt, as now. Delaying will not make it better, but wor&s;es upon this Ac|count. Say, have not &s;ome of you had Tho'ts of &s;etting about the Work of Repentance Years ago; but thro' one Temptation or an|other, have neglected it till now? And is it any better upon that Account now, than be|fore? Are there not as &s;trong Temptations to defer as ever? And &s;o you may expect there will be, if you delay longer. Delay no longer then, but <HI>&s;eek the</HI> LORD <HI>while he may be found,</HI> and <HI>call upon him while he is near.</HI> Improve a good Time, while you have it.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>If you will not hearken to the Coun&s;els of GOD, nor take Warning by his Judgmens, who know but GOD will &s;ay in righteous Judgment, Why &s;hould ye be &s;tricken any more, an leave you in the Congregation of dead Souls?</HI> It would be but a righteous Retribution, if we re&s;olve to delay the Work of Repentance any longer, and har|den our Hearts again&s;t the Warnings of God,

<P>And how &s;ad a Judgment would this be? Then we might <HI>hear indeed, and under&s;tand not, &s;ee but perceive not:</HI> Then, if we remain'd longer in the World, we &s;hould be but like the barren Fig-tree, <HI>upon which no Fruit grew:</HI> Or like <HI>the dejected Earth, which beareth Thorns and Briars; who&s;e End is to be burned.</HI></P>
<P>Some have thus been left of God. &mdash; So when GOD had Coun&s;elled and warned I&s;rael, and it proved to no Purpo&s;e; he righteou&s;ly <HI>gave them up to their own Hearts Lu&s;ts, and &s;aid, Why &s;hould ye be &s;tricken any more?

<P>And it hath been &s;omtimes ob&s;erved, that when GOD begins early to warn Per&s;ons, and to &s;trive with them by his Spirit, if his War|nings be &s;lighted, and the Strivings of his Spirit re&s;i&s;ted, GOD early leaves them, and takes away his holy Spirit from them.</P>
<P>Thus Many, who have had awakening Means, and the Strivings of GOD's Spirit in their Youth, have been left when they advance
<PB N="35" REF="004829_0024_100DFD249347BEC8">in Years, and &s;uffered to walk in their own Coun&s;els all their days.

<P N="5">5 <HI>If hereafter GOD &s;houd give you &s;aving Re|pentance, the Delaying of it will be Matter of bitter Sorrow to Tou then</HI> If there be &s;ome In&s;tances of &s;uch as have long delayed Repentance and found Mercy with the LORD at la&s;t, Yet <HI>they mourn at the La&s;t,</HI> and bitterly bewail their former Times: They find, that they have been wornging their own Soule; and with Tears lament it before the LORD. It fills their Hearts with Sorrow, that they have lo&s;t &s;uch precious Opportunities; mi&s;erably wa&s;t|ed away their Days, and mi&s;pent a Sea&s;on of Grace: It afflicts their very Souls, to remem|ber how much they have di&s;honoured GOD, and liv'd in Vain; or what is wor&s;e, to the evil Purpo&s;es of Sin, big with Mi&s;ery and Death. Now, <HI>the Sins of their Youth</HI> cau&s;e their Hearts to ake, and <HI>&s;ill their Bones</HI> with Sorrow.</P>
<P>So that, if we find Mercy at la&s;t, it will co&s;t us Abundance of Sorrow, if we delay the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Work of Repentance.</P>
