<LG>
<L>HARD drinking is an evil great,</L>
<L>Makes people more prophane;</L>
<L>It ruins many man's e&s;tate,</L>
<L>And others brings to &s;hame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young men, in their full &s;trength and prime,</L>
<L>To taverns they will go;</L>
<L>There &s;pend their money and their time,</L>
<L>Which proves their overthrow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For there they get to playing cards,</L>
<L>And other fooli&s;h plays;</L>
<L>So they mu&s;t have their ju&s;t rewards</L>
<L>For all &s;uch evil ways.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some aged fathers act the &s;ame,</L>
<L>Though much to their di&s;grace;</L>
<L>To them it is both &s;in and &s;hame</L>
<L>To frequent &s;uch a place.</L>

<L>When men, with children and with wives,</L>
<L>Befool them&s;elves with drink,</L>
<L>So that they lead unhappy lives,</L>

</LG>

<L>How many go about and beg:</L>
<L><HI>More Cider</HI> is the cry;</L>

<L>For bad examples they do &s;et</L>
<L>Before their families;</L>

<L>A damage to the commonwealth,</L>
