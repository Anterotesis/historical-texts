<OPENER><SALUTE>Candid READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following <HI>Sermon</HI> needs no Commendation. The Truth, Weight and Sea&s;onablene&s;s of its Matter, the So|briety of its Stile, the Mode&s;ty of its Addre&s;s, together with the Spirit of Piety, of Humility, of undi&s;gui&s;ed Zeal for God, and affectionate Love to Man, which breathes in every Part, and animates the Whole, will commend it to the Con&s;ciences of all that fear God, who have the Plea&s;ure of peru&s;ing it. Here are no high &s;ounding Words of Vanity, or little Artifices to exalt him|&s;elf, and catch a vulgar Applau&s;e; but an hone&s;t, &s;erious En|deavour to honor God, and do good to Mankind.&mdash;Let not the pious Author be offended with our Freedom, in &s;aying, that his Life adds Weight to this Di&s;cour&s;e; for the Latter is but a Copy of the Former: Nor &s;hould it be forgotten, that the gracious God, who delights to honor the Humble and Sincere in Heart, gave manife&s;t Tokens of his &s;pecial Pre&s;ence, when this Di&s;cour&s;e was delivered: Not only the Speaker, but divers of the Hearers, both Mini&s;ters and People, being &s;olemnly affected and tenderly touched with the precious Truths therein contained.&mdash;May God, of his infinite Mercy, keep the&s;e Things in the Imagination of the Thoughts of our Hearts, and enable us to act accordingly:

May we, e&s;pecially who are of the Sacred Order, obtain Mercy to be faithful, as well as prudent and humble unto Death.</P>
<P>There is nothing of greater Con&s;equence to the Weal of the Churches, than taking due Care re&s;pecting the Admi&s;&s;ion of Can|didates into the Mini&s;try. If we are lax in this, and ea&s;ly in|troduce Per&s;ons who have no po&s;itive Evidences of vital Godli|ne&s;s; Error will come in as a Flood, and inundate the Churches; experimental Piety gradually langui&s;h, and at la&s;t totally expire: To prevent which awful Events, may Al|mighty GOD ble&s;s the following Di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;We add no more, but remain thy Servants for CHRIST's Sake.</P>

<P>Therefore &s;eeing we have this Mini&s;try, as we have received Mercy, we faint not.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Men, Brethren</HI> and <HI>Fathers,</HI> in &s;everal important re&s;pects, far excels in Glory the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Di&s;pen&s;a|tion. This the Apo&s;tle had ob&s;erved and clearly proved in the preceding Chapter, and from thence draws the ju&s;t Conclu&s;ion in our Text, <HI>Therefore &s;eeing we have this Mini&s;try, as we have received Mercy, we faint not.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may ob&s;erve &s;everal Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try refer'd to, call'd, <HI>This Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Here are &s;ome engag'd in this Work: WE HAVE <HI>this Mini&s;try.</HI> They are put in Tru&s;t with the Go&s;pel <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> ii. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. This is to be acknowledged as a Mercy from God: <HI>As we have</HI> RECEIVED MERCY, Some Expo&s;itors chu&s;e to join this Sentence with the la&s;t Clau&s;e, thus; as <HI>we have re|ceived Mercy, we faint not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007643_0005_102D97EC29ED8158"><HI>The&s;e</HI> under&s;tood the Mercy here intended, to be, that of Mini&s;ters being kept from fainting under their Trials.</P>
<P><HI>Others</HI> join the two fir&s;t Sentences in our Text together thus, <HI>Therefore &s;eeing we have this Mini&s;try, as we have re|ceived Mercy.</HI> They conceive the Mercy here &s;poken of is that of being call'd and employ'd in the &s;acred Work. <HI>Be|za</HI>'s Judgment in particular is mentioned in the Continuati|on of <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotations, in the&s;e Words; <Q>The Tradu|cers of this great Apo&s;tle took Advantage from his great Trials and Afflictions, by rea&s;on of them, to conclude him no &s;uch Man, as he was by &s;ome repre&s;ented; and the Apo&s;tle upon that takes Advantage to magnify his Office. God <HI>(&s;aith he)</HI> having intru&s;ted us with &s;o <HI>glorious</HI> a Mini|&s;tration, as I have proved that of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> to be, according to the Mea&s;ure and Proportion of Gifts and Graces, which God hath be&s;towed upon us, or by rea&s;on of that infinite Grace and Mercy, which God hath &s;hewed us, in calling us to &s;o <HI>honorable</HI> a Station and Of|fice, though we meet with many Adver&s;aries, many Af|flictions, many Difficulties, yet we bear up, and &s;ink not under them, nor faint in our Spirits becau&s;e of them.</Q></P>
<P>Thus far he. In this Sen&s;e I propo&s;e to con&s;ider the Words of our Text.</P>
<P N="4">4. We may ob&s;erve, that great Difficulties mu&s;t be ex|pected in the Work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, or there would be no Danger of <HI>Fainting.</HI></P>
<P>Again, that we ought not to faint under the&s;e Difficulties and Trials, but &s;hould be able to &s;ay, through Grace, with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>we faint not.</HI></P>
<P>And further, that an excellent Argument again&s;t <HI>Fainting</HI> in this Work, may be drawn from the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try it|&s;elf, and the &s;everal Motives, that relate to it. <HI>Therefore &s;eeing we have this Mini&s;try, we faint not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007643_0006_102D97EDC1772AF8"><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> That faithful Mini&s;ters are kept from <HI>Fainting,</HI> by the&s;e precious Truths and Motives &s;et home with divine Pow|er on their Souls; hence they can &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>We faint not;</HI> otherwi&s;e we &s;hould &s;urely <HI>faint.</HI></P>
<P>I might comprize the&s;e important Ob&s;ervations in a gene|ral One, and lay it down as the Foundation of the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e; but as that would open too large a Field for this Opportunity, I &s;hall <HI>confine</HI> my&s;elf to the Con&s;ideration and Improvement of the&s;e two Things, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Mercy</HI> of being call'd to the Work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, and &s;ome of the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Arguments</HI> which are adapted to guard a|gain&s;t extreme Di&s;couragements, and to excite to active and per&s;evering Diligence and Faithfulne&s;s in the Work.</P>
<P>And here I would humbly and earne&s;tly intreat my reve|rend <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI> (with others of <HI>God's People</HI> pre|&s;ent) to lift up your Hearts with Faith and Fervency to the God of all Grace and Fulne&s;s in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that I may be enabled &s;o to <HI>&s;peak</HI> on the&s;e Heads, and you &s;o to hear, as that our Souls may be much quickened and animated in our Work, in order to the &s;aving Good of many Souls, and the Advancement of the Divine Glory in the World.</P>
<P>I am, according to the Method propos'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. To con&s;ider it as a <HI>Mercy</HI> to faithful Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, that they have <HI>this Mini&s;try,</HI> that they are call'd to this Work. <HI>We have this Mini&s;try, as we have received Mer|cy,</HI> &s;aith our Text. God in his Mercy is &s;et forth by an ex|cellent Divine, as God willing to &s;uccour &s;inful Men in their Mi&s;ery. And how is this remarkably manife&s;ted to, and ex|perienced by &s;uch of the &s;inful mi&s;erable Sons of Men, as are prepared for, and improved in the mini&s;terial Work. Thus the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> with re&s;pect to the glorious Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God, which was committed to his Tru&s;t, &s;ays, <HI>I thank Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the Mini&s;try</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 11, 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007643_0007_102D97EFEC840EA0">Indeed, when Men ru&s;h into the Mini&s;try, without the Qualifications which the Word of God requires; they act a mo&s;t fooli&s;h Part, and a Part mo&s;t dangerous and pernici|ous, both to them&s;elves and others: But when they are en|dow'd with tho&s;e Qualifications, and withal &s;et apart to the &s;acred Work by Fa&s;ting and Prayer, and the laying on of the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> xiv. 23. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 14.</NOTE> they may well be drawn out in Thankfulne&s;s to God and Chri&s;t, on the Account, and &s;ay, This is a <HI>Mercy,</HI> a <HI>great Mercy,</HI> confer'd on us <HI>unworthy, vile and &s;inful</HI> Du&s;t, <HI>that unto us is committed the Mini&s;try of Reconciliation</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 18, 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This the Amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t ju&s;tly e&s;teem a <HI>Mercy,</HI> as it re&s;pects <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> as it re&s;pects <HI>others,</HI> and as they may thus in an <HI>eminent</HI> Degree promote the <HI>Divine Glory</HI> in the World.</P>
<P N="1">1. As it re&s;pects <HI>them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>What a Mercy is it to be call'd to a Work, which is cal|culated to promote their Increa&s;e of <HI>Grace</HI> as well as <HI>Gifts?</HI> And what a <HI>Comfort</HI> mu&s;t it be to the faithful Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, to con&s;ider, that their <HI>general</HI> and <HI>particular</HI> Callings do happily coincide and &s;ub&s;erve each other? Their general Calling, the Care of <HI>their own</HI> Souls, their particular Calling, the Care of <HI>others</HI> Souls. The more clo&s;ely they walk with God them&s;elves, &s;o much the more faithful and engag'd they are in their Work, and the more likely to be &s;ucce&s;sful; and on the other Hand, the more faithful they are in their Work, through Grace, &s;o much the more <HI>they grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 18.</NOTE>. So much the more <HI>their Souls pro&s;per and are in Health</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. of John v. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> and ordinarily the more they enjoy the <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> of the Divine Spirit, <HI>which are not &s;mall,</HI> the more their Light &s;hines before others, and they adorn their
<PB N="9" REF="007643_0008_102D97F2765A2B58">
Profe&s;&s;ion, and the more they are attemper'd to the heaven|ly State, and prepared for eternal Glory.</P>
<P>'Tis true they are from &s;everal Quarters be&s;et at times with Temptations, perhaps more &s;o than others; as Officers in an Army are more aim'd and pointed at by the Enemy than private Soldiers; but the&s;e Temptations their great Lord and Leader wi&s;ely permits, to <HI>prove</HI> them, and bring them to know more of them&s;elves, that they may take root downwards, in order to bear Fruit upwards; he &s;hews them thus their own In&s;ufficiency, and leads them to depend up|on his All-&s;ufficiency in the New Covenant, and hereupon they find him <HI>a very pre&s;ent Help in Trouble</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al</HI> xlvi. 1.</NOTE>: They are thus humbled and purified, and made more meet for their Ma&s;ter's Service, more watchful and circum&s;pect, more pa|tient and re&s;ign'd under Trials and Sufferings, and more di|ligent in their Work, and probably more &s;ucce&s;sful too; and this is a <HI>great Mercy,</HI></P>
<P>Again, the Mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are to <HI>give them&s;elves to reading, to Meditation and Prayer;</HI> and how may they thus, through the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, grow apace, both in doc|trinal and experimental Knowledge, yea, I may add, in e|very Chri&s;tian Grace and Virtue? And is not this a <HI>great Mercy?</HI></P>
<P>It is a further Comfort and a Mercy too, that we, who have <HI>this Mini&s;try,</HI> may be preaching to our&s;elves, as well as praying over the Sermons we prepare for, and preach to others; yea, we may &s;ee more clearly the beautiful Harmo|ny and Connection of divine Truths, as well as feel more of the happy Effects of them; while we are attending on the Expo&s;ition of &s;acred Scripture, and when catechi&s;ing our People, or making Preparations therefor.</P>
<P>In the Admini&s;tration of divine Ordinances, e&s;pecially the Sacraments of the New Te&s;tament, how may we reap much Profit and Plea&s;ure our&s;elves, through Grace, &s;ee more of
<PB N="10" REF="007643_0009_102D97F408F171A8">
the Faithfulne&s;s, Grace, Holine&s;s, and other Perfections of our God and Saviour; and grow more holy, comfortable and fruitful.</P>
<P>In our <HI>Pa&s;toral Vi&s;its</HI> we may often, through Divine A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, caution and comfort, direct and edify others and our&s;elves at the &s;ame Time,</P>
<P>And in the Di&s;cipline of God's Hou&s;e, while we endea|vour to reclaim others, we may be not a little guarded and benefited our&s;elves: We may be led to &s;ee much of the Ag|gravations and Evil of Sin, the Snares that lie thick around, the con&s;tant Nece&s;&s;ity of Watchfulne&s;s and Prayer, and of living by Faith on God in Chri&s;t; that we may as <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and as <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> bring forth much Fruit.</P>
<P>In a Word, <HI>every</HI> Part of the mini&s;terial Work is in &s;ome re&s;pect or other adapted to promote our increa&s;ing Conformi|ty to the Perfections and Will of God in our Hearts and Lives: Is it not then a <HI>Mercy,</HI> a <HI>great Mercy,</HI> that we have been call'd to this Work? <HI>We have this Mini&s;try, as we have received Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Though it is a difficult, yet it is al&s;o a delightful and u&s;e|ful, as well as honourable Work; and it is a <HI>Mercy,</HI> not only with re&s;pect to <HI>us,</HI> but al&s;o,</P>
<P N="2">2. With re&s;pect to <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>It is truly adapted, both in the public and private Parts of it, as a Means to promote the be&s;t, the everla&s;ting Intere&s;ts of all our Hearers; but Men are hardened by Sin and Unbelief, and blinded by Satan and the World: <HI>They hate the Light, and will not come to the Light, le&s;t their Deeds &s;hould be repro|ved</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iii. 20.</NOTE>. And nothing &s;hort of the Almighty Energy of the Holy Gho&s;t, will make the Word effectual to &s;aving Purpo|&s;es; well may the <HI>Regenerate</HI> then be &s;aid to be <HI>born of the Spirit</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iii. 5, 8.</NOTE>. <HI>By Grace we are &s;aved, through Faith,
<PB N="11" REF="007643_0010_102D97F5928F09A0">
and that not of our&s;elves, it is the Gift of God: Not of Works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould boa&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 8, 9.</NOTE>. But as the Spirit makes U&s;e of the Word, &s;o we are &s;aid to be <HI>born again by the Word of God, and begotten through the Go&s;pel</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 23. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 15.</NOTE>. And Faith is &s;aid to <HI>come by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God; for how &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how &s;hall they hear without a Preacher? and how &s;hall they preach, except they be &s;ent</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> x. 17, 14, 15.</NOTE>? The Apo&s;tle was not <HI>a&s;hamed of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, for,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>it is the Power of God unto Salvation to every one that believeth</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><L>Very ju&s;t then is the Conclu&s;ion drawn by the pious and ingenious <HI>Watts,</HI></L>
<L>Should all the Forms that Men devi&s;e,</L>
<L>A&s;&s;ault my Faith with treach'rous Art,</L>
<L>I'd call them Vanity and Lies,</L>
<L>And bind the Go&s;pel to my Heart.</L></NOTE>; <HI>and to the&s;e we are the Savour of Life unto Life,</HI> through rich Grace, although to others <HI>the Savour of Death unto Death</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> i. 16. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We are call'd in the mini&s;terial Work, as In&s;truments to <HI>in&s;truct</HI> the Ignorant, to <HI>convince</HI> the Erroneous, to <HI>reclaim</HI> the Vicious, to <HI>awaken</HI> the Secure, to <HI>rouze</HI> the Slothful, to <HI>&s;ap</HI> the Foundation of Hypocrites, and to <HI>&s;hew</HI> the Self-righteous their extream and de&s;tructive Folly; and though this is truly hard Work, yet it mu&s;t be done in God's Strength, and when done and ble&s;t, very u&s;eful.</P>
<P>It is further u&s;eful and plea&s;ant withal, to <HI>direct</HI> enquiring Souls to Chri&s;t, to <HI>win</HI> them over to him, through his all-powerful Grace, that they may receive him in his mo&s;t glorious Per&s;on and precious Benefits, as he is offer'd in the Go&s;pel: And what a <HI>Mercy</HI> is this both to us and them.</P>
<P>Again, we are call'd as In&s;truments, to <HI>build up</HI> the Saints in Faith, and Holine&s;s, and Comfort. We are to <HI>comfort</HI> them in their Trials from within and without, <HI>with the
<PB N="12" REF="007643_0011_102D97F8CF1897F0">
&s;ame Con&s;olations, wherewith we our&s;elves are comforted of God.</HI> And is it not a Favour to be made thus u&s;eful to God's Peo|ple? We were call'd in our Work <HI>to carry the Lambs in our Bo&s;om, and gently to lead tho&s;e that are with Young,</HI> after the Example and under the Influence of the great, the chief Shepherd <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;a.</HI> xl. 2.</NOTE>. We are to give <HI>Milk to Babes,</HI> as well as <HI>&s;trong Meat</HI> to the more grown <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 1, 2.</NOTE> to <HI>&s;trengthen</HI> the Weak, to <HI>fix</HI> the Wavering, to <HI>guide</HI> the Doubting, to <HI>quicken</HI> the Backward, to <HI>&s;uccour</HI> the Tempted, to <HI>direct</HI> Believers to <HI>be &s;trong,</HI> not in the Grace they have received, but <HI>in the Grace which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> and to be engaged, through Grace, in improving the Comforts they enjoy, as Encouragements and Means to an higher End, even Holine&s;s and the Divine Glory. Thus our Work, the <HI>mini&s;terial</HI> Work is adapted, and thus it is ble&s;t to the Benefit of many Souls: We may ju&s;tly &s;ay then, <HI>We have this Mini&s;try, as we have received Mercy:</HI> E&s;pecially &s;ince,</P>
<P N="3">3. We may, with Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, by and in this Work, in an <HI>eminent</HI> Degree promote the <HI>Divine Glory</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>How is the Glory of God and Chri&s;t and true <HI>Religion</HI> ma|nife&s;ted by our Increa&s;e in Gifts and Grace, in Holine&s;s and U&s;efulne&s;s Thence it appears in &s;ome Mea&s;ure what a Ma&s;|ter we &s;erve, what a God we wor&s;hip, what a Saviour we preach and offer, what a <HI>Religion</HI> we profe&s;s and recom|mend.</P>
<P><HI>My Brethren,</HI> certainly God is the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Be|ings; &s;urely then, the &s;etting him forth to be, or manife&s;t|ing him as &s;uch, is the greate&s;t and highe&s;t End that can be: This is his Glory, this End is worthy of a God, and this is the highe&s;t End of all his Friends, Children and Servants: This End, the Work of the Mini&s;try, is wonderfully &s;uited and ble&s;t to promote: What a <HI>Mercy</HI> is it then to any of us <HI>vile, apo&s;tate</HI> and <HI>peri&s;hing</HI> Sons of Men, to be brought
<PB N="13" REF="007643_0012_102D97FB5664E130">
home to Chri&s;t, and call'd to this &s;acred Work. <HI>We have this Mini&s;try, as we have received Mercy.</HI></P>

Alas! that &s;o much of our Time is run to Wa&s;te, and we have done no more for God: Oh! then, let us &s;eize the <HI>flying Moments,</HI> and employ them all for God, and Chri&s;t, and Souls.</P>
<P>Some of our Number within a few Years pa&s;t are called home from their <HI>Work</HI> to their <HI>Reward,</HI> from light and <HI>momentary Trials,</HI> to a <HI>far more exceeding, and eternal Weight of Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! that <HI>a double Portion of the Spirit</HI> may fall on us who &s;urvive, that we may <HI>redeem</HI> our <HI>Time</HI> in the be&s;t Manner, and double our Diligence!</P>
<P>Many Opportunities we have to expre&s;s our Love to Chri&s;t and Souls in this Life, that we &s;hall never have afterwards: Oh! that we may improve them all, through Grace, to the be&s;t Purpo&s;e!</P>
<P>Hold out <HI>Faith and Patience,</HI> hold out <HI>Zeal, Activity and Courage,</HI> a little longer, and we &s;hall, <HI>Reverend and dear Sirs,</HI> be with our triumphant Brethren above, and perfectly enjoy, glorify and prai&s;e our God and Saviour for ever and ever.</P>

<P>I may &s;ay to you as I have heard it was &s;aid by tho&s;e who were going to take <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> when they parted with their Friends upon the Shore, <Q>Do you <HI>pray</HI> for us, and we will <HI>fight</HI> for you:</Q> Yea, I may &s;ay farther, Do you <HI>pray</HI> for us,

<P>Oh! con&s;ent to be happy, and to live for ever, and don't <HI>kill</HI> your&s;elves; don't <HI>throw</HI> your&s;elves Body and Soul into Hell: This you <HI>will</HI> do, if you continue in <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Unbe|lief.</HI></P>
<P>We come in God's Name to you, and <HI>pray you in Chri&s;t's Stead to be reconciled to God:</HI>&mdash;We preach the <HI>Terrors</HI> of the Law, as Means &s;uited to awaken and convince you of your &s;inful, awful State, and ab&s;olute <HI>Need</HI> of a <HI>Saviour;</HI> and we &s;et before you the <HI>Invitations</HI> of the Go&s;pel, and the Grace, Beauties and Glories of <HI>Immanuel;</HI> with De&s;ires, that you may, by the Almighty Power and Grace of God, be made willing to receive Chri&s;t Je&s;us, ju&s;t as he is offered in the Go&s;pel, and re&s;t upon him alone for Salvation: Then, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> you will be inconceivably happy and ble&s;&s;ed for ever.</P>
