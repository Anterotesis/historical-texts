<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO THE QUARTERLY and MONTHLY MEETINGS of Friends.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BELOVED FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FEELING at this time a renewed concern that the pure principle of Light and Life, and the righ|teous fruits thereof may &s;pread and prevail among&s;t mankind, there is an engagement on my heart to labour with my brethren in religious profe&s;&s;ion, that none of us may be a &s;tumbling block in the way of others; but may &s;o walk that our conduct may reach the pure Wit|ne&s;s in the hearts of &s;uch who are not in profe&s;&s;ion with us.</P>
<P>And, dear Friends, while we publicly own that the Holy Spirit is our leader, the profe&s;&s;ion is in it&s;elf weight|ty, and the weightine&s;s thereof increa&s;eth, in propor|tion as we are noted among the profe&s;&s;ors of Truth, and active in dealing with &s;uch who walk di&s;orderly.</P>
<P>Many under our profe&s;&s;ion for want of due attention, and a perfect re&s;ignation, to this Divine Teacher, have in &s;ome things manife&s;ted a deviation from the purity of our religious principles, and the&s;e deviations having crept in among&s;t us by little and little, and increa&s;ing from le&s;s to greater, have been &s;o far unnoticed, that &s;ome living in them, have been active in putting di&s;ci|pline in practice with relation to others, who&s;e con|duct hath appeared more di&s;honourable in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="012630_0002_0F8B9278CC63E3E8">
Now as my mind hath been exerci&s;ed before the Lord, I have &s;een, that the di&s;cipline of the Church of Chri&s;t &s;tandeth in that which is pure; that it is the wi&s;dom from above which gives authority to di&s;cipline, and that the weightine&s;s thereof &s;tandeth not in any outward circum|&s;tances, but in the authority of Chri&s;t who is the author of it; and where any walk after the fle&s;h, and not ac|cording to the purity of Truth, and at the &s;ame time are active in putting di&s;cipline in practice, a veil is gra|dually drawn over the purity of di&s;cipline, and over that holine&s;s of life, which Chri&s;t leads tho&s;e into, <Q>in whom the love of God is verily perfected,</Q> 1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 5.</P>
<P>When we labour in true love with offenders, and they remain ob&s;tinate, it &s;ometimes is nece&s;&s;ary to proceed as far as our Lord directed, <Q><HI>Let him be to thee as an heathen man, or a publican,</HI></Q> Mat. xviii. 17.</P>
<P>Now when &s;uch are di&s;owned, and they who act there|in feel Chri&s;t made unto them wi&s;dom, and are pre&s;erved in his meek, re&s;toring &s;pirit, there is no ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence mini&s;tred to any; but when &s;uch who are active in dealing with offenders indulge them&s;elves in things which are contrary to the purity of Truth, and yet judge others who&s;e conduct appears more di&s;honourable than their's, here the pure authority of di&s;cipline cea&s;eth as to &s;uch offenders, and a temptation is laid in their way to wrangle and contend;&mdash;<HI>"Judge not,"</HI> &s;aid our Lord, <HI>"that ye be not judged."</HI> Now this forbidding, alludes to man's judgment, and points out the nece&s;&s;ity of our hum|bly attending to that &s;anctifying Power under which the Faithful experience the Lord to be "a &s;pirit of judgment to them," <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxviii. 6. And as we feel his Holy Spirit to mortify the deeds of the body in us, and can &s;ay, <Q>it is no more I that live, but Chri&s;t that liveth in me,</Q> here right judgment is known.</P>
<P>And while Divine Love prevails in our hearts, and Self in us is brought under judgment, a preparation is
<PB N="3" REF="012630_0003_0F8B9279989A33D8">felt to labour in a right manner with offenders; but it we abide not in this love, our outward performance in dealing with others, degenerates into formality; for <HI>"this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments,"</HI> John i.3.</P>
<P>How weighty are tho&s;e in&s;tructions of our Redeemer concerning religious duties, when he points out, that they who may, &s;hould be &s;o obedient to the teachings of the Holy Spirit, that humbly con&s;iding in his help, they may &s;ay, "Thy name O Father be hallowed! Thy kingdom come! thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven!"&mdash;In this awful &s;tate of mind is felt that wor|&s;hip which &s;tands in doing the will of God, on earth, as it is done in heaven, and keeping the Holy Name &s;a|cred? To take a holy profe&s;&s;ion upon us is awful, nor can we keep this Holy Name &s;acred, but by humbly abiding under the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. The apo&s;tle laid a heavy complaint again&s;t &s;ome who prophaned this Holy Name by their manner of living, "through you," he &s;ays, "the name of God is bla&s;phemed among the Gen|tiles,"<HI>Rom.</HI>
ii. 24.</P>
<P>Some of our ance&s;tors through many tribulations were gathered into the &s;tate of true wor&s;hippers, and had fel|low&s;hip in that which is pure, and as one was inwardly moved to kneel down in their a&s;&s;emblies, and publickly call on the name of the Lord, tho&s;e in the harmony of united exerci&s;e then pre&s;ent, joined in the prayer; I mention this in order that we of the pre&s;ent age, may look unto the Rock from whence we were hewn, and remember that to unite in wor&s;hip, is a union in prayer, and that prayer acceptable to the Father is only in a mind truly &s;anctified, where the &s;acred name is kept holy, and the heart re&s;igned to do his will on earth as it is done in heaven, <HI>"If ye abide in me,"</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <Q><HI>and my words abide in you, ye &s;hall a&s;k what ye will in my name, and it &s;hall be done unto you.</HI></Q>&mdash;Now we know not what
<PB N="4" REF="012630_0004_0F8B927A4A702650">to pray for as we ought, but as the Holy Spirit doth open and direct our minds, and as we faithfully yield to its influences, our prayers are in the will of our Heavenly Father, who fails not to grant that which his own Spirit, through his Children, a&s;keth;&mdash;thus pre&s;ervation from &s;in is known, and the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s are brought forth by &s;uch who inwardly unite in prayer.</P>
<P>How weighty are our &s;olemn meetings when the name of Chri&s;t is kept holy?</P>
<P>"How precious is that &s;tate in which the children of the Lord are &s;o redemed from the love "of this world, that they are accepted and ble&s;&s;ed in all that they do." R. Barclay's Apology, p. 404.</P>
<P>How nece&s;&s;ary is it that we who profe&s;s the&s;e princi|ples, and are outwardly active in &s;upporting them, &s;hould faithfully abide in Divine Strength, that <Q><HI>As He who has called us, is holy, &s;o we may be holy in all manner of conver&s;ation,</HI></Q> 1 Pet. i. 15.</P>
<P>If one pro&s;e&s;&s;ing to be influenced by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, propo&s;e to unite in a labour to promote rightcou&s;ne&s;s in the earth, and in time pa&s;t he hath manife&s;tly deviated from the path of equity, then to act con&s;i&s;tent with this principle, his fir&s;t work is to make re&s;titution &s;o far as he may be enabled; for if he attempts to contribute to|ward a work intended to promote righteou&s;ne&s;s, while it appears that he neglecteth, or refu&s;eth to act righte|ou&s;ly him&s;elf, his conduct has a tendency to entangle the minds of tho&s;e who are weak in the faith, who behold the&s;e things, and to draw a veil over the purity of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, by carrying an appearance as though that was righteou&s;ne&s;s which is not.</P>
<P>Again, if I propo&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;upporting tho&s;e doc|trines wherein that purity of life is held forth, in which cu&s;toms proceeding from the &s;pirit of this world have no place, and at the &s;ame time &s;trengthen others in tho&s;e cu&s;toms by my example; the fir&s;t &s;tep then in an orderly
<PB N="5" REF="012630_0005_0F8B927B05ED5580">proceeding, is to cea&s;e from tho&s;e cu&s;toms my&s;elf, and afterwards to labour, as I may be enabled, to promote the like di&s;po&s;ition and conduct in others.</P>
<P>To be convinced of the pure principle of Truth, and diligently exerci&s;ed in walking an&s;werable thereto, is nece&s;&s;ary before I can con&s;i&s;tently recommend this prin|ciple to others.&mdash;I often feel a labour in &s;pirit, that we who are active members in religious &s;ociety may experi|ence in our&s;elves the truth of tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of the Holy One&mdash; "I will be &s;ancti&s;ied in them that come nigh me." <HI>Lev.</HI> x. 3.&mdash;in this ca&s;e, my mind hath been often exerci&s;ed when alone, year after year, for many years, and in the renewings of Divine Love, a tender care hath been incited in me, that we who profe&s;s the inward principle of light to be our teacher, may be a family unit|ed in that purity of wor&s;hip, which comprehends a ho|ly life, and mini&s;ters in&s;truction to others.</P>
<P>My mind is often drawn towards children in the Truth, who having a &s;mall &s;hare of the things of this life, and coming to have families may be inwardly exerci&s;ed before the Lord to &s;upport them in a way agreeable to the purity of Truth, in which they may feel his ble&s;&s;ing upon them in their labours; the thoughts of &s;uch being entangled with cu&s;toms (contrary to pure wi&s;dom) con|veyed to them through our hands, doth often very ten|derly, and movingly affect my heart, and when I look towards, and think on the &s;ucceeding generation, fer|vent de&s;ires are rai&s;ed in me, that we by yielding to that Holy Spirit which leads into all truth, may not do the work of the Lord deceitfully, may not live contrary to the purity of the Divine Principle we profe&s;s; but that as faithful labourers in our age, we may be in&s;trumental in removing &s;tumbling blocks out of the way of tho&s;e who may &s;ucceed us.</P>
<P>So great was the love of Chri&s;t, that he gave him&s;elf for the church, <Q>that he might &s;anctify and clean&s;e it,
<PB N="6" REF="012630_0006_0F8B927BC9441DB8">that it &s;hould be holy, and without blemi&s;h, not having &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing,</Q> <HI>Eph.</HI> v. 25. and where any take the name of Chri&s;t upon them, profe&s;|&s;ing to be members of his church, and led by his Holy Spirit, and yet manife&s;tly deviate from the purity of Truth, they herein act again&s;t the gracious de&s;ign of his giving him&s;elf for them, and mini&s;ter cau&s;e for the con|tinuance of his afflictions, viz. in his body the church.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;uffered afflictions in a body of fle&s;h prepared by the Father, but the afflictions of his my&s;tical body are yet unfini&s;hed; for they who are baptized into Chri&s;t are baptized into his death, and as we humbly abide un|der his &s;anctifying Power, and are brought forth into newne&s;s of life, we feel Chri&s;t to live in us, who being the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and forever, and always at unity with him&s;elf, his Spirit in the hearts of his people leads to an inward exerci&s;e for the &s;alvation of man|kind; and when under a travail of &s;pirit, we behold a vi&s;ited people entangled by the &s;pirit of this world with its wickedne&s;s and cu&s;toms, and thereby rendered inca|pable of being faithful examples to others, &s;orrow and heavine&s;s under a &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things, is often experi|enced, and thus in &s;ome mea&s;ure is filled up that which remains of the afflictions of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;peaking concerning gifts offered in Divine Service, &s;ays, <Q><HI>If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembre&s;t that thy brother hath ought again&s;t thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, fir&s;t be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</HI></Q> Mat. v. 23, 24.&mdash;Now there is no true unity, but in that wherein the Father, and the Son are united, nor can there be a perfect reconciliation but in cea&s;ing from that which mini&s;ters cau&s;e for the continuation of the afflictions of Chri&s;t; and if any profe&s;&s;ing to bring their gift to the altar, do remember the cu&s;tomary con|tradiction which &s;ome of their fruits bear to the pure,
<PB N="7" REF="012630_0007_0F8B927C7B170788">&s;piritual wor&s;hip, here it appears nece&s;&s;ary to lay to heart this command, <HI>"leave thy gift by the altar."</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t graciou&s;ly calls his people brethren, <Q><HI>who&s;oever &s;hall do the will of God the &s;ame is my brother.</HI></Q> Mark iii. 35. Now if we walk contrary to the Truth as it is in Je&s;us, while we continue to profe&s;s it, we offend again&s;t Chri&s;t, and if under this offence we bring our gift to the altar, our Redeemer doth not direct us to take back our gift, he doth not di&s;courage our proceeding in a good work; but graciou&s;ly points out the nece&s;&s;ary means by which the gift may be rendered acceptable, "<HI>leave,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>thy gi&s;t by the altar, fir&s;t go and be reconciled to thy bro|ther,</HI>" cea&s;e from that which grieves the Holy Spirit, cea&s;e from that which is again&s;t the Truth, as it is in Je&s;us, and then come, and offer thy gift.</P>
<P>I feel, while I am writing, a tenderne&s;s to tho&s;e who through Divine Favour are pre&s;erved in a lively &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of the churches, and at times may be under di&s;couragements with regard to proceeding in that pure way which Chri&s;t by his Holy Spirit leads into: the depth of di&s;order and weakne&s;s, which &s;o much prevails, be|ing opened, doubtings are apt to ari&s;e as to the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of proceeding as an a&s;&s;embly of the Lord's people in the pure council of Truth; and here I feel a concern to expre&s;s in uprightne&s;s, that which hath been opened in my mind, under the power of the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, re|lating to a vi&s;ible gathered church, the members where|of are guided by the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>The church is called the body of Chri&s;t, <HI>Col.</HI> i. 24.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t is called the head of the church, <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 22.</P>
<P>The church is called the Pillar, and ground of Truth, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 15.</P>
<P>Thus the church hath a name that is &s;acred, and the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping this name holy, appears evident; for where a number of people unite in a profe&s;&s;ion of being led by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and publi&s;h their principles
<PB N="8" REF="012630_0008_0F8B927D4A9486D0">to the world, the acts and proceedings of that people may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be con&s;idered as &s;uch which Chri&s;t is the author of.</P>
<P>Now while we &s;tand in this &s;tation, if the pure light of life is not followed and regarded in our proceedings, we are in the way of prophaning the Holy Name, and of going back toward that wilderne&s;s of &s;ufferings and per&s;ecution, out of which, through the tender mercies of God, a church hath been gathered; <Q><HI>Chri&s;t liveth in &s;anctified ve&s;&s;els,</HI></Q> <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 20. and where they behold his Holy Name profanced, and the pure Go&s;pel Light eclip&s;ed through the unfaithfulne&s;s of any who by their &s;tation appear to be &s;tandard bearers under the Prince of Peace, the living members in the body of Chri&s;t in beholding the&s;e things, do in &s;ome degree experience the fellow&s;hip of his &s;ufferings, and as the wi&s;dom of the world more and more takes place in conducting the affairs of this vi&s;ible gathered church, and the pure leadings of the Holy Spirit le&s;s waited for and followed, &s;o the true &s;uffering &s;eed is more and more oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>My mind is often affected with a &s;en&s;e of the condi|tion of &s;incere hearted people in &s;ome kingdoms, where liberty of con&s;cience is not allowed, many of whom be|ing burthened in their minds with prevailing &s;uper&s;tition joined with oppre&s;&s;ions, are often under &s;orrow, and where &s;uch have attended to that pure Light which hath in &s;ome degree opened their under&s;tandings, and for their faithfulne&s;s thereto, have been brought to exami|nation and tryal, how heavy are the per&s;ecutions which in divers parts of the world are exerci&s;ed upon them? How mighty, as to the outward, is that power by which they are borne down, and oppre&s;&s;ed?</P>
<P>How deeply affecting is the condition of many upright hearted people who are taken into the papal inqui&s;ition? What lamentable cruelties, in deep vaults, in a private way, are exerci&s;ed on many of them? and how linger|ing
<PB N="9" REF="012630_0009_0F8B927F7B8D1E00">is that death by a &s;mall &s;low fire, which they have frequently indured, who have been faithful to the end?</P>
<P>How many tender-&s;pirited prote&s;tants have been &s;en|tenced to &s;pend the remainder of their lives in a galley chained to oars, under hard-hearted ma&s;ters, while their young children are placed out for education, and taught principles &s;o contrary to the con&s;cience of the parents, that by di&s;&s;enting from them, they have hazarded their liberty, lives, and all that was dear to them of the things of this world?</P>
<P>There have been in time pa&s;t &s;evere per&s;ecutions un|der the Engli&s;h government, and many &s;incere-hearted people have &s;u&s;&s;ered death for the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, who&s;e faithfulne&s;s in their day hath mini|&s;tred encouragement to others, and been a ble&s;&s;ing to many who have &s;ucceeded them; thus from age to age, the darkne&s;s being more and more removed, a channel at length, through the tender mercies of God, hath been opened for the exerci&s;e of the pure gift of the go&s;pel mi|ni&s;try, without interruption from outward power, a work, the like of which is rare, and unknown in many parts of the world.</P>
<P>As the&s;e things are often fre&s;h in my mind, and this great work of God going on in the earth has been open before me, that liberty of con&s;cience with which we are favoured, hath appeared not as a light matter.</P>
<P>A tru&s;t is committed to us, a great and weighty tru&s;t, to which our diligent attention is nece&s;&s;ary, wherever the active members of this vi&s;ible gathered church u&s;e them|&s;elves to that which is contrary to the purity of our principles, it appears to be a breach of this tru&s;t, and one &s;tep back toward the wilderne&s;s, one &s;tep towards undo|ing what God in infinite love hath done through his faith|ful &s;ervants, in a work of &s;everal ages, and like laying the foundation for future &s;ufferings.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="012630_0010_0F8B927FA815BBE8">
I feel a living invitation in my mind to &s;uch who are active in our religious &s;ociety, that we may lay to heart this matter, and con&s;ider the &s;tation in which we &s;tand; a place of outward liberty under the free exerci&s;e of our con&s;cience toward God, not obtained but through great and manifold afflictions of tho&s;e who lived before us. There is gratitude due from us to our Heavenly Father, and ju&s;tice to our po&s;terity; can our hearts endure, or our hands be &s;trong, if we de&s;ert a cau&s;e &s;o precious, if we turn a&s;ide from a work under which &s;o many have patiently laboured?</P>
<P>May the deep &s;ufferings of our Saviour be &s;o dear to us, that we nay never trample underfoot the adorable Son of God, nor count the blood of the covenant unho|ly!</P>
<P>May the faithfulne&s;s of the martyrs when the pro&s;pect of death by fire was before them, be remembred! and may the patient con&s;tant &s;ufferings of the upright-hearted &s;ervants of God in latter ages be revived in our minds! and may we &s;o follow on to know the Lord, that neither the faithful in this age, nor tho&s;e in ages to come, may ever be brought under &s;uffering, through our &s;lid|ing back from the work of reformation in the world!</P>
<P>While the active members in the vi&s;ible gathered church &s;tand upright, and the a&s;fairs thereof are carried on under the leadings of the Holy Spirit, altho' di&s;orders may ari&s;e among us, and cau&s;e many exerci&s;es to tho&s;e who feel the care of the churches upon them; yet while the&s;e continue under the weight of the work, and labour in the meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom for the help of others, the name of Chri&s;t in the vi&s;ible gathered church may be kept &s;acred; but while they who are active in the affairs of this church, continue in a manife&s;t oppo&s;ition to the purity of our principles, this as the prophet I&s;aiah x. 18. expre&s;&s;eth it, is like <HI>"as when a &s;tandard bearer fainteth,"</HI> and thus the way opens to great, and prevailing de|generacy,
<PB N="11" REF="012630_0011_0F8B928058718D98">and to &s;ufferings for &s;uch who through the power of Divine Love, are &s;eparated to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and cannot unite with any thing which &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to the purity of it.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of an inward &s;tillne&s;s, hath under the&s;e exerci&s;es appeared clear to my mind; in true &s;ilence &s;trength is renewed, the mind herein is weaned from all things, but as they may be enjoyed in the Divine Will, and a lowline&s;s in outward living oppo&s;ite to world|ly honour, becomes truly acceptable to us;&mdash;in the de|&s;ire after outward gain, the mind is prevented from a perfect attention to the voice of Chri&s;t, but being weaned from all things, but as they may be enjoyed in the Di|vine Will, the pure light &s;hines into the &s;oul, and where the fruits of that &s;pirit which is of this world, are brought forth by many who profe&s;s to be lead by the Spirit of Truth, and cloudine&s;s is felt to be gathering over the vi&s;ible gathered church, the &s;incere in heart who abide in true &s;tillne&s;s, and are exerci&s;ed therein before the Lord for his name &s;ake, have a knowledge of Chri&s;t in the fellow&s;hip of his &s;ufferings, and inward thankfulne&s;s is felt at times, that through Divine Love, our own wi&s;dom is ca&s;t out, and that forward active part in us &s;ubjected, which would ri&s;e and do &s;omething in the vi|&s;ible gathered church, without the pure leadings of the Spirit of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>While aught remains in us different from a perfect re|&s;ignation of our wills, it is like a &s;eal to a book where|in is written <Q>that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God concerning us,</Q> <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 2. but when our minds entirely yield to Chri&s;t, that &s;ilence is known, which followeth the opening of the la&s;t of the &s;eals, <HI>Rev.</HI> viii. 1. in this &s;ilence we learn abiding in the Divine Will, and there feel, that we have no cau&s;e to promote but that only in which the light of life directs us in our proceedings, and that the alone way to be u&s;eful in the

<P>As my mind hath been thus exerci&s;ed, I have &s;een that to be active, and bu&s;y in the vi&s;ible gathered church, without the leadings of the Holy Spirit is not only un|profitable, but tends to increa&s;e dimne&s;s, and where way is not opened to proceed in the light of Truth, a &s;top is felt by tho&s;e who humbly attend to the Divine Leader, a &s;top which in relation to good order in the vi&s;ible ga|thered church, is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to be ob|&s;erved; thus Robert Barclay in his treati&s;e on di&s;cipline holds forth, page 65, 68, 84. <Q><HI>that the judgment or con|clu&s;ion of the church or congregation, is no further effectual "as to the true end and de&s;ign thereof, but as &s;uch judgment "or conclu&s;ion proceeds from the Spirit of God operating on their minds who are &s;anctified in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now in this &s;top I have learned the nece&s;&s;ity of waiting on the Lord in humility, that the works of all may be brought to the light, and tho&s;e to judgment which are wrought in the wi&s;dom of this world, and have al&s;o &s;een, that in a mind thoroughly &s;ubjected to the power of the Cro&s;s, there is a &s;avour of life to be felt, which evidently tends to gather &s;ouls to God, while the greate&s;t works in the vi&s;ible gathered church brought forth in man's wi&s;dom, remain to be unprofitable.</P>
<P>Where people are divinely gathered into a holy fel|low&s;hip, and faithfully abide under the influence of that Spirit which leads into all Truth, "they are the light of the world," <HI>Mat.</HI> v. 14. Now holding this profe&s;&s;i|on, to me hath appeared weighty, even beyond what I can fully expre&s;s, and what our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;eemed to have in view, when he propo&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ity of counting the co&s;t, before we begin to build.</P>

I tru&s;t there are many who at times, under Divine vi|&s;itation, feel an inward enquiry after God, and when &s;uch in the &s;implicity of their hearts mark the lives of a people who profe&s;s to walk by the leadings of his Spi|rit, of what great concernment is it that our lights &s;hine clear, that nothing of our conduct carry a contradiction to the Truth as it is in Je&s;us, or be a means of profaning his Holy Name, and be a &s;tumbling block in the way of tho&s;e &s;incere enquirers.</P>
<P>When &s;uch &s;eekers who wearied with empty forms, look toward uniting with us as a people, and behold active members among us depart in their cu&s;tomary way of living, from that purity of life, which under humbling exerci&s;es hath been opened before them, as the way of the Lord's people, how mournful and di&s;couraging is the pro&s;pect? and how &s;trongly doth &s;uch unfaithfulne&s;s operate again&s;t the &s;preading of the peaceable, harmoni|ous principle and te&s;timony of Truth among&s;t mankind?</P>
<P>In entering into that life, which is hid with Chri&s;t in God, we behold his peaceable government, where the whole family are governed by the &s;ame &s;pirit, and the "doing to others as we would they &s;hould do unto us," groweth up as good fruit from a good tree, the peace, quietne&s;s, and harmonious walking in this government is beheld with humble reverence to him who is the au|thor of it, and in partaking of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, we partake of that which labours, and &s;uffers for the increa&s;e of this peaceable government among the inhabitants of the world; and I have felt a labour of long continuance that we who profe&s;s this peaceable principle, may be faithful &s;tandard bearers under the Prince of Peace, and that nothing of a defiling nature, tending to di&s;cord and wars, may remain among us.</P>
<P>May each of us query with our&s;elves, have the trea|&s;ures I po&s;&s;e&s;s, been gathered in that wi&s;dom which is from above, &s;o far as hath appeared to me?</P>

Have none of my fellow-creatures an equitable right to any part which is called mine?</P>
<P>Have the gifts, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions received by me from others been conveyed in a way free from all unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;o far as I have &s;een?</P>
<P>The principle of peace in which our tru&s;t is only on the Lord, and our minds weaned from a dependance on the &s;trength of armies, hath appeared to me very preci|ous, and I often feel &s;trong de&s;ires, that we who profe&s;s this principle, may &s;o walk, as to give ju&s;t cau&s;e for none of our fellow-creatures to be offended at us; that our lives may evidently manife&s;t, that we are redeemed from that &s;pirit in which wars are: Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in pointing out the danger of &s;o leaning on man, as to neglect the leadings of his Holy Spirit, &s;aid, <Q><HI>Call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your father which is in heaven,</HI></Q> Mat. xxiii. 9. where the wi&s;dom from above is faithfully followed, and therein we are entru&s;ted with &s;ub&s;tance, it is a trea&s;ure committed to our care in the nature of an inheritance, as an inheri|tance from him, who formed, and &s;upports the world. Now in this condition the true enjoyment of the good things of this life is under&s;tood, and that ble&s;&s;ing felt, in which is real &s;afety; this is what I apprehend our ble&s;&s;ed Lord had in view, when he pronounced, <Q><HI>Ble&s;|&s;ed are the meek, for they &s;hall inherit the earth.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Selfi&s;h worldly minded men may hold lands in the &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit, and depending on the &s;trength of the out|ward power, be perplexed with &s;ecret unca&s;ine&s;s, le&s;t the injured &s;hould &s;ometime overpower them, and that mea&s;ure meted to them, which they mea&s;ure to others. &mdash;Thus &s;elfi&s;h men may po&s;&s;e&s;s the earth; but it is the meek who inherit it, and enjoy it as an inheritance from the Heavenly Father, free from all the de&s;ilements and perplexities of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
