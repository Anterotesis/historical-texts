<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel is a chief means of the &s;alvation of mankind, it is of great importance for all to have right ideas about the call and characters of the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. Yet mi&s;takes about the&s;e things are exceeding com|mon in the world. And though men generally complain of the&s;e evils, yet how few make the holy &s;criptures their only rule to guard again&s;t them? Many exclaim again&s;t old <HI>traditious,</HI> who are far from being clear of them them&s;elves; and <HI>oppo|&s;ition of &s;cience, fal&s;ely &s;o called,</HI> hath filled the world with <HI>perver&s;e di&s;putings.</HI> And we have abundant evidence, that <HI>the love of money is the root of all evil.</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 5, 10, 20. But as per&s;ecution hath not the &s;word of the magi&s;trate in America to enforce it, <HI>oppo&s;ition of knowledge</HI> cannot be &s;o fierce here, as in other countries.</P>
<P>When the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e was fir&s;t publi&s;hed, in the year 1754, great violence was exerci&s;ed again&s;t all mini&s;ters who were not educated for that work, and &s;upported by worldly power. And a|mong the multitude of publications &s;ince, I have never &s;een one upon the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of an internal call from God to preach his go&s;pel. And as this di&s;cour&s;e hath lately been frequently in|quired
<PB N="vi" REF="024062_0004_0FC2FD5D81A77258">after, I have thought proper to revi&s;e it, and &s;end it again into the world. For God &s;ays, <HI>If any man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his.</HI> And if this be e&s;&s;ential to the character of a Chri&s;|tian, how much more for a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t? And he &s;ays, <HI>Ye &s;hall know them by their fruits.</HI> Therefore an attempt is here al&s;o made to explain tho&s;e fruits, as they are plainly de&s;cribed in the holy &s;criptures. And each per&s;on has an equal right to judge for him&s;elf about &s;oul-guides, as he can an&s;wer it to God, who will finally reward every man according to his works: when no deceitful arts can avail with any teacher or hearer. And deceit and cruelty, under religious pretences, hath brought forth the infidelity and contempt of all vital and practical religion, which &s;o much pre|vails in our day. Men have been very careful in civil governments, to attribute all the mi&s;chiefs therein to inferior officers, or to the people, and not to the HEAD of the government; but in religi|ous matters, all the hypocri&s;ies and villanies that have appeared among tho&s;e who have profe&s;&s;ed to believe the Chri&s;tian religion, have been turned again&s;t the authority of Chri&s;t in his church. But the time is nigh, when the deaf &s;hall hear the words of God's book, and the eyes of the blind &s;hall &s;ee out of ob&s;curity, and out of darkne&s;s; the meek al&s;o &s;hall increa&s;e their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men &s;hall rejoice in the holy One of I&s;rael.</P>

<HEAD>THE NATURE AND NECESSITY <HI>OF AN</HI> Internal Call to preach the Go&s;pel.</HEAD>
<P>THE public preaching of the go&s;pel, is as plain an ordinance of God as any one that he ever in&s;tituted; and the importance of it is acknowledged by all men who profe&s;s any re|gard to the truth of Chri&s;tianity. But how men are called into that work, and how others may know them, &s;o as to obey the go&s;pel, and avoid deceivers, are que&s;tions which have filled the world with controver&s;y. And as true believers are al|ways the be&s;t &s;ubjects of civil government, deceit|ful men have held them in bondage, ever &s;ince the &s;word of the magi&s;trate was brought into the church of Chri&s;t. Mini&s;ters had a&s;&s;umed the place of lawgivers and judges for the church, before Con|&s;tantine came to the throne; and it is &s;aid, "He confirmed with his royal authority, the canons and determinations of the bi&s;hops, which they had de|creed in their con&s;i&s;tories, that &s;o the princes of other nations might not abrogate their decrees. For the judgment of the <HI>prie&s;thood</HI> in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, is to be preferred before the opinion of a &s;ecular judge." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;ebius's life of Con&s;tantine, p. 61.</NOTE> And from that day to this, the
<PB N="8" REF="024062_0006_0FC2FD6E5B351680">prejudices of natural affection, education, honor, gain, and &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, have all con&s;pired a|gain&s;t allowing each one to an&s;wer a good con|&s;cience towards God in all the affairs of his wor&s;hip. The &s;word of the Spirit, which is the word of God, gave a deadly wound to the power of the bea&s;t, in the REFORMATION two hundred and &s;eventy-five years ago; but that deadly wound was &s;oon heal|ed, &s;o that deceit and cruelty, which is the charac|ter of the devil and his children, hath been carried as far round the world by Prote&s;tants, as ever it was by Papi&s;ts. And the <HI>prie&s;thood</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of his children, is as much di&s;regarded under the one as the other of the&s;e names. For the in|&s;pired apo&s;tle Peter &s;ays to every true believer, Seeing ye have purified your &s;ouls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren; &s;ee that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: being born again, not of corrupt|ible &s;eed, but incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.&mdash;And this is the word which by the go&s;pel is preached unto you. Wherefore, laying a&s;ide all malice, and all guile, and hypocri&s;ies, and envies, and all evil-&s;peakings, as new-born babes, de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby; if &s;o be ye have ta&s;ted that the Lord is gracious: to whom com|ing, as unto a living &s;tone, di&s;allowed indeed of men, but cho&s;en of God, and precious; ye al&s;o, as lively &s;tones, are built up a &s;piritual hou&s;e, an <HI>holy prie&s;thood,</HI> to offer up &s;piritual &s;acrifices, acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;Ye are a cho&s;en genera|tion, a <HI>royal prie&s;thood,</HI> an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye &s;hould &s;hew forth the prai&s;es of him who hath called you out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light. 1 Peter i. 22&mdash;25. ii. 1&mdash;9.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="024062_0007_0FC2FD6F617DF598">
Every per&s;on who is born again, is a prie&s;t unto God, and is required daily to offer up &s;piritual &s;a|crifices to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And the&s;e are the only prie&s;thood, and holy nation, that he hath un|der heaven. And our Lord &s;ays, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye &s;hall not &s;ee the kingdom of heaven. Who&s;oever, there|fore, &s;hall humble him&s;elf as this little child, the &s;ame is the greate&s;t in the kingdom of heaven. Mat. xviii. 3, 4. And it is out of &s;uch little child|ren, that the Son of God calls forth his mini&s;ters, who are never called prie&s;ts in the new-te&s;tament, in di&s;tinction from the brethren. And the propo|&s;ition that I mean to prove is,</P>
<P><HI>That every true mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, is called into that work by the &s;ame Holy Spirit, that all his pro|phets and apo&s;tles were of old.</HI> And I &s;hall endeav|our to explain this propo&s;ition, and then prove it, and vindicate it again&s;t various objections. In explaining of it, I would ob&s;erve, that all the wri|ters of the oracles of God, were endued by him with power to work miracles to confirm the words which they publi&s;hed; which power is not given to his ordinary mini&s;ters, among people who pro|fe&s;s to own the truth of revelation. After the re&s;|urrection of our Lord, he appeared unto the <HI>eleven,</HI> and &s;aid unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature. He that be|lieveth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.&mdash;And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord work|ing with them, and <HI>confirming the word with &s;igns following.</HI> Amen. Mark xvi. 14&mdash;20. But &s;ince the &s;acred volume is compleated, and miracles are cea&s;ed, the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t have not that power from him: Though the <HI>man of &s;in</HI> was advanced
<PB N="10" REF="024062_0008_0FC2FD7607375210">in the <HI>temple of God,</HI> which is his church, with <HI>powers, and &s;igns, and lying wonders,</HI> and with <HI>all deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> in them that peri&s;h; becau&s;e they received not the <HI>love of the truth that they might be &s;aved.</HI> 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 3&mdash;10. <HI>Faith which worketh by love,</HI> is the only thing which availeth any &s;oul before God. Gal. v. 6. And, <HI>&s;peaking the truth in love,</HI> is the only way of grow|ing up into Chri&s;t, the HEAD of the church. Eph. iv. 15. Who &s;ays, <HI>If ye keep my commandments, ye &s;hall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Fa|ther's commandments, and abide in his love.</HI> John xv. 10. And to guard again&s;t <HI>mockers,</HI> who walk after their own <HI>ungodly lu&s;ts,</HI> the command to be|lievers is, <HI>Keep your&s;elves in the love of God, look|ing for the mercy of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto eternal life.</HI> Jude 18&mdash;21. Obedience to the revealed will of God, is the only way of &s;afety and happine&s;s, both for mini&s;ters and people. It was equally &s;o with his church before the Son of God gave him|&s;elf a <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> for us, as it is &s;ince, and will be to the end of the world. And that every true mini|&s;ter of Chri&s;t, is internally called into that work by the &s;ame Spirit that the prophets and apo&s;tles were, I think is evident, from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">I. They come in the name of the eternal JE|HOVAH, as really as any of his &s;ervants did of old. Mo&s;es was to &s;ay, I AM hath &s;ent me unto you. Exod. iii. 14. And Ezekiel was to &s;ay, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God,</HI> whether they would hear, or whether they would forbear. Ezek. ii. 4, 5. So Je&s;us &s;ays, Before Abraham was, I AM. John viii. 58. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them <HI>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever <HI>I have commanded you: and lo,</HI> I AM
<PB N="11" REF="024062_0009_0FC2FD776CFCB558"><HI>with you alway even unto the end of the world.</HI> Amen. Mat. xxviii. 19, 20. Thus every true mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, acts in the name of the great I AM; and therefore mu&s;t be called into the work by his Spirit.</P>
<P N="11">II. God is as near to his church as ever he was, and therefore no men can be inve&s;ted with power in his room, to call forth his mini&s;ters. The judges, prie&s;ts, and kings in I&s;rael, were only to execute the laws of God, which he revealed by his prophets. And God &s;aid, the man that will do <HI>pre&s;umptuou&s;ly,</HI> and will not hearken unto the prie&s;t (that &s;tandeth to mini&s;ter there before the Lord thy God) or unto the judge, even that man &s;hall die; and thou &s;halt put away the evil from I&s;rael. And if they would &s;et up a king over them, he mu&s;t be fir&s;t <HI>cho&s;en</HI> by God, from among their <HI>bre|thren;</HI> and he was to read in the law of God all the days of his life, that his heart might not be lifted up above his <HI>brethren.</HI> Deut. xvii. 11&mdash;20. And Je&s;us is the only antetype of Mo&s;es, Aaron, and David. Acts ii. 22&mdash;36. iii. 22, 23. Heb. v. 1&mdash;6. And he &s;ays to his church, Verily, I &s;ay unto you, What&s;oever ye &s;hall bind on earth, &s;hall be bound in heaven; and what&s;oever ye &s;hall loo&s;e on earth, &s;hall be loo&s;ed in heaven. Again I &s;ay unto you, That if two of you &s;hall agree on earth, as touching any thing that they &s;hall a&s;k, it &s;hall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together <HI>in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them.</HI> Mat. xviii. 15&mdash;20. To meet <HI>in his name,</HI> is to meet according to <HI>his commandment,</HI> with which his <HI>promi&s;e</HI> is con|nected, <HI>Lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world.</HI> And as he is always with the faithful, he as really calls forth his mini&s;ters, by his word and Spirit, as he ever did in ancient times.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="024062_0010_0FC2FD7D65CA54E8">
III. The children of men, yea, the children of God, are as incapable to determine who &s;hall be his mini&s;ters, as they were formerly. And an in|&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ays, After that, in the wi&s;dom of God, the world by wi&s;dom knew not God, it plea&s;|ed God by the fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching to &s;ave them that believe.&mdash;God hath <HI>cho&s;en</HI> the fooli&s;h things of the world, to confound the wi&s;e; and God hath <HI>cho&s;en</HI> the weak things of the world, to confound the things that are mighty; and ba&s;e things of the world, and things which are de&s;pi&s;ed, hath God <HI>cho&s;en,</HI> yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are; that no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his pre&s;ence. 1 Cor. i. 21&mdash;29. This he now doth, both as to his children and his mini&s;|ters, as much as he did in the apo&s;tolic age. And men mu&s;t &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light of rea|&s;on, as well as the light of revelation, not to &s;ee this in his late wonderful works among the nations. And yet many of the children of God are &s;till di&s;|puting, who &s;hall be the greate&s;t. The apo&s;tle John, under that di&s;po&s;ition, once &s;aid, Ma&s;ter, we &s;aw one ca&s;ting out devils in thy name, and he fol|loweth not <HI>us;</HI> and we forbad him, becau&s;e he followeth not <HI>us.</HI> But Je&s;us &s;aid, Forbid him not; for there is no man which &s;hall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly &s;peak evil of me. Mark ix. 33&mdash;39. The <HI>line of things,</HI> which is made ready to our hand, &s;ays, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth him|&s;elf, is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. 2 Cor. x. 16&mdash;18. This <HI>line</HI> is drawn by in&s;pira|tion in the word of God. But many teachers have taken this pa&s;&s;age to prove, that all men within <HI>lines</HI> which men have drawn, ought to be forced to &s;upport &s;uch teachers as are cho&s;en by the rul|ing
<PB N="13" REF="024062_0011_0FC2FD869C9250D8">party therein; and al&s;o, that &s;uch teachers may forbid all others to preach the go&s;pel within tho&s;e <HI>lines,</HI> who plea&s;e them not. Though the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles &s;ays, <HI>If I yet plea&s;ed men, I &s;hould not be the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t.</HI> And he &s;ays, If any man preach any other <HI>go&s;pel</HI> unto you, let him be <HI>accur&s;ed.</HI> Gal. i. 7&mdash;10.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try is e&s;&s;en|tially as great as ever it was; therefore men are to be called into it by the &s;ame holy Spirit that all the &s;ervants of God were of old. The church of Chri&s;t is built upon the <HI>foundation of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief corner Stone.</HI> Eph. ii. 20. The Jews who built upon their <HI>own righteou&s;ne&s;s, were in covenant with death, and with hell were at agreement.</HI> I&s;aiah xxviii. 15, 16. Rom. ix. 32, 33. <HI>For to be carnally minded is death; but to be &s;piritually minded, is life and peace: becau&s;e the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God; for it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI> Rom. viii. 6, 7. Loving him with all our powers, and loving our neighbours as our&s;elves, is the <HI>one thing needful.</HI> Luke x. 27, 28, 42. There|fore, to love the world, or our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, above God, is <HI>enmity</HI> again&s;t him. And he &s;ays, <HI>The friend&s;hip of the world is enmity with God.</HI> Jam. iv. 4. And God &s;aid to Ezekiel, I have &s;et thee a <HI>watchman</HI> unto the hou&s;e of I&s;rael; therefore thou &s;halt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. Ezek. xxxiii. 7. So he &s;ays by an in&s;pired apo&s;tle, Obey them that have the rule over you, and &s;ubmit your&s;elves; for they <HI>watch for your &s;ouls,</HI> as they that mu&s;t give account: that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you. Pray for us; for we tru&s;t we have a good con&s;cience, in all
<PB N="14" REF="024062_0012_0FC2FD87F171BAE8">things willing to live <HI>hone&s;tly.</HI> Heb. xiii. 17, 18. But how can mini&s;ters live <HI>hone&s;tly,</HI> if their <HI>tru&s;t</HI> is in an <HI>arm of fle&s;h,</HI> in&s;tead of the eternal JEHOVAH! for a <HI>cur&s;e</HI> of <HI>blindne&s;s</HI> is upon all &s;uch men. Jer. xvii. 5&mdash;8. Therefore the apo&s;tle Paul &s;aid to the elders of Ephe&s;us, I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men; for I have not &s;hunned to declare unto you all the coun&s;el of God. Take heed therefore unto your|&s;elves, and to all the flock over the which the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> hath made you over&s;eers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purcha&s;ed with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departing &s;hall grievous <HI>wolves</HI> enter in among you, not &s;paring the flock. Al&s;o of your own &s;elves &s;hall men ari&s;e, &s;peaking <HI>perver&s;e things,</HI> to draw away di&s;ciples after them. Therefore <HI>watch,</HI> and re|member that by the &s;pace of three years I cea&s;ed not to warn every one night and day with tears. And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the <HI>word of his grace,</HI> which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are &s;anctified. Acts xx. 26&mdash;32.</P>
<P>Elders and over&s;eers or bi&s;hops, are here called brethren, by one of the chiefe&s;t of the apo&s;tles; who informs them, that the Holy Gho&s;t made them over&s;eers of the flock of God; who&s;e power, and the word of his grace, was their &s;ufficient &s;e|curity again&s;t grievous wolves, and perver&s;e di&s;|puters. Therefore, as every true mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, acts in the name of the &s;ame God that the prophets and apo&s;tles did; and he is as near to his church now as formerly; and men are as unable to deter|mine who &s;hall be his me&s;&s;engers as ever they were, and their work of watching for &s;ouls and feeding Chri&s;t's &s;heep, is as great as ever, I conclude that
<PB N="15" REF="024062_0013_0FC2FD8EA98A9CF0">he as really calls them forth by his Spirit now as ever he did in the world. But how does he per|form this great work? or how are any men now called to preach the go&s;pel? I an&s;wer,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Our a&s;cended Lord, by the Holy Spirit, gives the church <HI>gifts for pa&s;tors and teachers,</HI> as well as for all other purpo&s;es in his kingdom. The Lord gave the word, great was the company of tho&s;e that publi&s;hed it.&mdash;Thou ha&s;t a&s;cended on high, thou ha&s;t led captivity captive: thou ha&s;t received <HI>gifts</HI> for men; yea, for the rebellious al&s;o, that the Lord God might dwell among them. And he &s;ays to his church, There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one bapti&s;m, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. P&s;alm lxviii. 11, 18. Eph. iv. 4&mdash;10. By this heavenly influence, the natural capacities and human accompli&s;hments of believers are &s;anctified, and they are prepared to fill up their place with duty and u&s;efulne&s;s, as much as every member of our natural body doth, under the direction of the head. And they who are de|&s;igned for preachers of the go&s;pel, have &s;pecial light given them, and the nature of revelation is opened with great &s;weetne&s;s to their &s;ouls. Jere|miah &s;aid, Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and re|joicing of mine heart. But he met with &s;uch cruel treatment, for his faithfulne&s;s in his work, that he &s;aid, I will not make mention of him, nor &s;peak any more in his name. But his word was in my heart as a burning fire &s;hut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not &s;tay. Jer. xv. 16. xx. 9. So God &s;aid to Ezekiel, Son of man, eat that thou finde&s;t; eat this roll, and go
<PB N="16" REF="024062_0014_0FC2FD90357DD130">&s;peak unto the hou&s;e of I&s;rael. So I opened my mouth, and he cau&s;ed me to eat the roll; and he &s;aid unto me, Son of man, cau&s;e thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels, with this roll that I give thee. Then I did eat it, and it was in my mouth as honey for &s;weetne&s;s. And he &s;aid unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and &s;peak with my words unto them. Ezek. iii. 1&mdash;4. Al&s;o, at the command of God, John took and eat the little book, and &s;ays, It was in my mouth &s;weet as honey; and as &s;oon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he &s;aid unto me, Thou mu&s;t pro|phe&s;y again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. Rev. x. 8&mdash;10. In all which, the &s;weetne&s;s of God's word, and the bitterne&s;s of preaching it to a &s;inful world, is plainly held forth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A di&s;covery of the worth of &s;ouls, and of the &s;tate of the church, goes before a call to preach the go&s;pel to them. This is nece&s;&s;ary in order for any to be faithful <HI>watchmen.</HI> Hence it is &s;aid, When Je&s;us &s;aw the multitudes, he was moved with com|pa&s;&s;ion on them, becau&s;e they fainted, and were &s;cattered abroad, as &s;heep having no &s;hepherd. Then &s;aith he unto his di&s;ciples, The harve&s;t truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few. Pray ye the Lord of the harve&s;t, that he will &s;end forth la|bourers into his harve&s;t. And he directly &s;ent forth the twelve into the harve&s;t. Mar. ix. 36&mdash;38.x. 1&mdash;7. And he &s;ent forth the &s;eventy in the &s;ame manner. Luke x. 1&mdash;3. And he &s;aid, Every &s;cribe which is in&s;tructed unto the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man that is an hou&s;holder, which bring|eth forth out of his trea&s;ure things new and old. Mat. xiii. 52. He is diligent, in the u&s;e of all lawful means, in &s;toring up knowledge of divine things, and of the &s;tate of the church, as well as
<PB N="17" REF="024062_0015_0FC2FD91D7924188">the world of mankind; and out of this &s;tore he bringeth forth food, to feed the people with know|ledge and under&s;tanding, which is the work of a pa&s;tor according to God's own heart. Jer. iii. 15.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. When &s;pecial gifts are be&s;towed upon any per&s;on, for the great work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, the authority of Chri&s;t requires him to be a faithful &s;teward thereof, as he can an&s;wer it to God in the la&s;t day. Hence the apo&s;tle Paul, after he had given the law of Chri&s;t, concerning the &s;upport of his mini&s;ters, and given notice that he did not ex|pect it of the church of Corinth, &s;aid, <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> is laid upon me; yea, wo is unto me, if I preach not the go&s;pel. 1 Cor. ix. 7&mdash;16. But many teachers in our day, in&s;i&s;t upon it, that all kind of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> is incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency. Though, at the &s;ame time, they lay a <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> upon all around them to yield to their <HI>wills,</HI> or to &s;uffer from them. They are <HI>&s;elfwilled,</HI> under the name of <HI>liberty.</HI> 2 Peter ii. 10, 19. But our Lord &s;aid, All that the Father giveth me, &s;hall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own <HI>will,</HI> but the <HI>will</HI> of him that &s;ent me. John vi. 37, 38. And who will dare to plead for a moral agency, contrary to the declaration of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles! For they that are &s;uch, &s;erve not our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but their own belly; and by good words and fair &s;peeches deceive the hearts of the &s;imple. To be <HI>&s;elfwilled,</HI> is the cau&s;e of all the &s;inful <HI>divi&s;ions</HI> in the world. Rom. xvi. 17, 18. But God &s;ays, As every man hath received the gift, even &s;o mini&s;ter the &s;ame one to another, as good &s;tewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the oracles of God; if any man mini&s;ter, let him do it as of the
<PB N="18" REF="024062_0016_0FC2FD9DB136E080">ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to whom be prai&s;e and dominion forever and ever. Amen. 1 Peter iv. 10, 11.</ITEM>

<P>The means and methods which God makes u&s;e of, in calling forth his mini&s;ters, are exceeding va|rious; &s;o that no exact &s;teps can be de&s;cribed by us, for his calling forth his mini&s;ters, any more than for his calling &s;ouls into the kingdom of his grace. But the teaching of the Spirit of God in his word, a view of the worth of &s;ouls and of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things among the people, with the command of Chri&s;t to preach his go&s;pel to them, is the e&s;&s;ence of an internal call into that great work. The external call is by his church, who are inve&s;ted with authority from Chri&s;t to carry all his laws into execution in his name. For, after warning believers of the danger, of being &s;poiled through <HI>philo&s;ophy and vain deceit,</HI> by men who do not hold THE HEAD, he &s;ays, Let the <HI>word of Chri&s;t</HI> dwell in you richly in all wi&s;dom; teaching and admoni&s;hing one another in p&s;alms, and hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs, &s;inging with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And what&s;oever ye do in word or deed, do all <HI>in the name</HI> of the Lord Je&s;us, giv|ing thanks to God and the Father by him. Col. ii. 8&mdash;10, 18&mdash;23. iii. 16, 17. In the la&s;t of the&s;e chapters he &s;ays, <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s is idolatry.</HI> And in another place he &s;ays, No whoremonger, nor un|clean per&s;on, nor <HI>covetous man who is an idolater,</HI> hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and of God. Eph. v. 5. And &s;uch have ever had a great influence in all national churches, by whom all wars have been managed. But when the hou&s;e of God, which is his church, &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon his revealed will, above all the powers of this
<PB N="19" REF="024062_0017_0FC2FD9F31168358">world, bloody wars will come to an end. And believers will &s;ay, <HI>All people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.</HI> Micah iv. 1&mdash;5. <HI>The &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High &s;hall take the kingdom, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</HI> Dan. vii. 18. For, though the devil will deceive multitudes, after the reign of the &s;aints for a thou|&s;and years, yet their complete de&s;truction will pre|vent any interruption of the kingdom of the &s;aints. Rev. xx. 7&mdash;9. All men de&s;ire &s;afety and happi|ne&s;s, and no men would <HI>di&s;obey</HI> the revealed will of God, if they were not <HI>deceived.</HI> Titus iii. 3. Evil men and &s;educers &s;hall wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e, <HI>deceiving,</HI> and being <HI>deceived.</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 13. No men would deceive others, if they were not fir&s;t deceived them&s;elves. And Chri&s;t &s;ays, If it were po&s;&s;ible, they &s;hall <HI>deceive</HI> the very <HI>elect.</HI> Mat. xxiv. 24. And multitudes are now &s;o much deceived, as to deny that God has an <HI>elect</HI> number among mankind, di&s;tinct from the re&s;t. But the apo&s;tle Peter writes to the &s;aints, and calls them the <HI>Elect</HI> according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, <HI>through &s;anctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and &s;prinkling of the blood of Ie&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And to them he &s;ays, The <HI>elders</HI> which are among you I exhort, who am al&s;o an <HI>elder,</HI> and a witne&s;s of the &s;uffer|ings of Chri&s;t, and al&s;o a partaker of the glory that &s;hall be revealed; feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the over&s;ight thereof, not by con&s;traint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being <HI>lords</HI> over God's heritage, but being <HI>en&s;amples</HI> of the flock. And when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear, ye &s;hall re|ceive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. Like|wi&s;e ye younger, &s;ubmit your&s;elves unto the elder;
<PB N="20" REF="024062_0018_0FC2FDA0CE2AD4C0">yea, all of you be &s;ubject one to and be clothed with humility: for God re&s;i&s;teth the proud, and giveth grace unto the humble. 1 Peter i. 2. v. 1&mdash;5.</P>
<P>Here is an exact de&s;cription of a church of Chri&s;t, and of the government thereof, di&s;tinct from all other communities in this world. They are elected by God, and &s;anctified by his Spirit, and &s;prinkled by the blood of Chri&s;t, our only High Prie&s;t. And all of the&s;e are an holy prie&s;t|hood. But the chief officers in the church are called <HI>elders,</HI> in di&s;tinction from the re&s;t of <HI>God's heritage.</HI> They are al&s;o called <HI>over&s;eers</HI> or <HI>bi&s;hops.</HI> Acts xx. 28. Titus i. 5, 7. And Peter, the fir&s;t of the <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> calls him&s;elf an <HI>elder.</HI> And it is the <HI>labouring elders,</HI> who are <HI>worthy of their reward.</HI> 1 Tim. v. 17, 18. <HI>And the Lord hath ordained, that they who preach the go&s;pel, &s;hould live of the go&s;|pel.</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 14. And if an angel from heaven &s;hould preach any other <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> than what the apo&s;|tles <HI>preached,</HI> and the churches then <HI>received,</HI> the command is, <HI>Let him be accur&s;ed.</HI> Gal. i. 7&mdash;9. For the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> of Chri&s;t, &s;aith unto Zion, <HI>Thy God reigneth.</HI> I&s;aiah lii. 7. Rom. x. 15. His laws, ex|ecuted by his church, where all mu&s;t act as little children, is the e&s;&s;ence of government therein. For <HI>lord&s;hip</HI> is of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and is excluded from the church of Chri&s;t. Mark x. 15, 42, 43. And it is now excluded from the United States of America, and from the government of France; and &s;hall <HI>lord&s;hip</HI> be retained by religious mini&s;ters? Shall every civil officer be &s;et up, or depo&s;ed by the people, and this liberty be denied to the church of Chri&s;t? How much hath infidelity been promoted by this tyranny? Yet many objections have been made again&s;t our doctrine, the chief of which I &s;hall attempt to an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="024062_0019_0FC2FDA4733705E0">
The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, that we would &s;et up common min|i&s;ters of the word, as equal with the prophets and apo&s;tles. To which I an&s;wer, that the apo&s;tle Pe|ter, in the pa&s;&s;ages now recited, puts him&s;elf upon a level with other elders, in the government of the church, &s;aying, God re&s;i&s;teth the proud, and giv|eth grace to the humble. And he begins his &s;e|cond epi&s;tle by &s;aying, Simon Peter, a &s;ervant and an apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to them that have ob|tained <HI>like precious faith with us, through the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the knowledge of God, and of Je&s;us our Lord; ac|cording as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godline&s;s, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue; whereby are <HI>given unto us exceeding great and precious promi&s;es, that by the&s;e you might be partakers of the divine nature, having e&s;caped the cor|ruption that is in the world through lu&s;t.</HI> And giv|ing all diligence, in the pur&s;uit of virtue, know|ledge, temperance, patience, godline&s;s, brotherly kindne&s;s, and charity, is the only way that he points out, for us to make our <HI>calling and election &s;ure.</HI> 2 Peter i. 1&mdash;10. Therefore all men who hold that they are <HI>elected,</HI> and &s;hall be finally <HI>&s;aved,</HI> with|out <HI>diligence</HI> in the way of holine&s;s, are deceived. And enemies to &s;alvation by &s;overeign grace, have taken great advantage from &s;uch men. But for any to claim the <HI>promi&s;es</HI> of God, without obeying his <HI>precepts,</HI> is <HI>tempting</HI> of him, and not <HI>tru&s;ting</HI> in him; which iniquity cau&s;ed multitudes to lay their <HI>carca&s;es in the wilderne&s;s.</HI> And Paul &s;ays, Let us labour therefore to enter into that re&s;t, left any man fall after the &s;ame example of unbelief. Deut. vi. 16, 17. Mat. iv. 7. Heb. iii. 5&mdash;11. iv. 11. By
<PB N="22" REF="024062_0020_0FC2FDA61433FF40">all which we may &s;ee, that the apo&s;tles put them|&s;elves upon a level with every believer, about faith and obedience to God in his church. And one of them &s;ays, I wrote unto the church; but Dio|trephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. Wherefore if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doth, prating again&s;t us with malicious words; and not content therewith, neither doth he him&s;elf receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and ca&s;teth them out of the church. 3 John 9, 10. And the world hath been filled with &s;uch arbitrary and malicious conduct, ever &s;ince the days of Con|&s;tantine. All mini&s;ters who claim a power above the church of Chri&s;t, in &s;ending forth his mini&s;ters, exalt them&s;elves above the apo&s;tles, who claimed no <HI>dominion</HI> over the faith of the church. 2 Cor. i. 24.</P>
<P>Yet a <HI>&s;econd</HI> objection again&s;t the call now pleaded for, is taken from the words of Paul to Timothy, who &s;aid, The things that thou ha&s;t heard of me among many witne&s;&s;es, the &s;ame com|mit thou to faithful men, who &s;hall be able to teach others al&s;o. <HI>Commit thou,</HI> is held to be the work of mini&s;ters in ordinations, and not of the church. But how little do the&s;e objectors regard other things in the &s;ame epi&s;tle? For therein the apo&s;tle &s;ays, Hold fa&s;t <HI>the form</HI> of &s;ound words, which thou ha&s;t heard of me, <HI>in faith and love which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI>&mdash;And the things that thou ha&s;t heard of me among many witne&s;&s;es, the &s;ame commit thou to &s;aithful men, who &s;hall be able to teach others al&s;o.&mdash; This know al&s;o, that in the la&s;t days perilous times &s;hall come; for men &s;hall be <HI>lovers of their own|&s;elves</HI>&mdash;having <HI>a form</HI> of godline&s;s, but denying the power thereof: from &s;uch turn away. 2 Tim. i. 13. ii. 2. iii. 1&mdash;5. <HI>The form</HI> of godline&s;s is in
<PB N="23" REF="024062_0021_0FC2FDB1E49FB3B0">the holy &s;criptures; but <HI>a form,</HI> to cover <HI>&s;elf-love,</HI> is condemned therein. It is al&s;o &s;aid, The time will come when they will not endure &s;ound doc|trine, but after their own lu&s;ts &s;hall they heap to them&s;elves teachers, having itching ears. And they &s;hall turn away their ears from the truth, and &s;hall be turned unto fables. 2 Tim. iv. 3, 4. And what heaps of teachers of fables have there been &s;ince the apo&s;tolic age! and can there be a greater fable, than the conceit is of an external &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of office power in officers from the apo&s;tles to our times! For if mini&s;ters can initiate children into the church, before they can choo&s;e for them&s;elves, and no men but mini&s;ters can give or take away that power, they are above all civil rulers upon earth, who are all &s;et up or pulled down by the people. And is not this <HI>the great city, which reign|eth over the kings of the earth?</HI> Rev. xvii. 18.</P>
<P>Yet, <HI>thirdly,</HI> many object again&s;t the internal call now pleaded for, as a thing which would de&s;troy all order in the church. If every man who thinks he is called of God to preach the go&s;pel, is under obligation to do it, will not all manner of confu&s;ion take place in the church, and no power on earth can controul them? Thus teachers have rea&s;oned again&s;t the call now pleaded for. But who con|trouled the power of Great-Britain, when they were &s;purred on by religious teachers, to contend with fire and &s;word for power to take away our money unju&s;tly? was it not the PEOPLE of America, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the eternal GOD, who maketh wars to cea&s;e unto the end of the earth? P&s;alm xlvi. 9. 10. He only calleth any &s;oul out of darkne&s;s, into the marvellous light of his go&s;pel; and he &s;ays to his royal prie&s;t|hood, and holy nation, <HI>Submit your&s;elves to every or|dinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake.</HI> 1 Peter ii. 9, 13
<PB N="24" REF="024062_0022_0FC2FDB33879B3E0">If any men invade the rights of their neighbours, the magi&s;trate beareth not the &s;word in vain; for rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Rom. xiii. 1&mdash;10. While fal&s;e teachers, bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war again&s;t him. Micah iii. 5. And if &s;uch men are &s;upported by the &s;word of the magi&s;trate, they are the greate&s;t ob&s;tructers of all good order, both in church and &s;tate. But when the church of Chri&s;t is governed by his laws, &s;he trieth fal&s;e teachers, as well as fal&s;e brethren, and is commend|ed by her Lord for &s;o doing. Rev. ii. 2, 3. It was the one particular church of Ephe&s;us, who per|formed this acceptable &s;ervice, and not all the &s;even churches of A&s;ia; and much le&s;s not a con|vention of all their officers.</P>
<P>Yet, <HI>fourthly,</HI> &s;ome in&s;i&s;t upon it, that if any think that they are called into the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, by the &s;ame Spirit who called the prophets and apo&s;tles, they mu&s;t work miracles to confirm their mi&s;&s;ion. But it is very evident, that working miracles, to confirm the truth of the word of God, was not &s;o great an evidence of the call of a per&s;on into the kingdom of grace, or into the mini&s;try, as the works of faith, hope, and charity. 1 Cor. xiii. 1&mdash;3, 13. And when a di&s;pute was rai&s;ed in the church of Corinth, whether Paul was a true mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, or not, he &s;aid, Ye are our epi&s;tle written in our hearts, known and read of all men; fora&s;much as ye are manife&s;tly declar|ed to be the epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t, mini&s;tered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of &s;tone, but in fle&s;hly tables of the heart. 2 Cor. iii. 1&mdash;3. Epi&s;tles of commendation, of members and mini&s;ters, to tho&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="024062_0023_0FC2FDB44FE51F50">who knew them not before, is a practice e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by rea&s;on and revelation; but the conver&s;ion of &s;ouls, by the preaching of any man, is a greater commendation of the preacher, than external mi|racles upon the bodies of any men can be. For the turning fornicators unto a cha&s;te way of living; idolaters to the wor&s;hip of the living God; thieves, the covetous, drunkards, revilers, and extortioners, into the ways of hone&s;ty, liberality, temperance, and true benevolence, recommends the in&s;truments of &s;uch a glorious change, more than any letters written with ink and pen can do. Therefore Paul &s;aid, <HI>The &s;eal of mine apo&s;tle&s;hip are ye in the Lord.</HI> 1 Cor. vi. 8&mdash;11. ix. 2. How vain then is the above objection?</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Many have objected again&s;t our doc|trine, as that which would invalidate human learn|ing, and the benefit of a liberal education; which they have called, <HI>A river, the &s;treams whereof &s;hall make glad the city of God.</HI> But if we attend to the &s;ame &s;acred writer, from whom they have taken the&s;e words, he will condemn their &s;cheme. For he &s;ays, Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that walketh not in the coun&s;el of the ungodly, nor &s;tandeth in the way of &s;inners, nor &s;itteth in the &s;eat of the &s;cornful; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he &s;hall be like a tree planted by the <HI>rivers of water,</HI> that bringeth forth his fruit in his &s;ea&s;on; his leaf al&s;o &s;hall not wither, and what&s;oever he doth &s;hall pro&s;|per.

And &s;uch men <HI>wre&s;t the &s;criptures</HI> unto their own de&s;truction. 2 Peter iii. 16. So God &s;aid of the church of I&s;rael, Her princes within her are roaring <HI>lions;</HI> her judges are even|ing <HI>wolves,</HI> they gnaw not the bones till the mor|row. Her prophets are light and treacherous per|&s;ons; her prie&s;ts have polluted the &s;anctuary, they have <HI>done violence to the law.</HI> Zeph. iii. 3, 4. And national churches in latter ages, have done the like through the world. But an in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ays, What man knoweth the things of a man, &s;ave the &s;pirit of man which is in him? even &s;o the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the &s;pirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things al&s;o we &s;peak, not in the words which man's wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth; comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual. 1 Cor. ii. 11&mdash;13.

<P>A <HI>&s;ixth</HI> objection again&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of an in|ternal call, by the Spirit of God, to preach his go&s;pel; which is, That many <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> and de|luded per&s;ons have held to &s;uch an internal call; but none of the great reformers, nor of the fathers of this country, ever held to any &s;uch thing. An|&s;wer, The example of ancient reformers, and of their good fathers, hath been the plea of all men when it would &s;uit their de&s;igns; but when it did not plea&s;e them, they were ready to exclaim again&s;t old traditions, and to follow their own inventions. Though, if the reformers in Germany, and the fa|thers of New-England, had not been moved by the Spirit of God, independent of all the powers of Europe, they could never have accompli&s;hed the great work of reformation in either country. Nei|ther did the reformers in Germany, nor our fathers in this land, hold to an external &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mini&s;|terial power from the church of Rome. But the church of England held theirs from thence; and
<PB N="28" REF="024062_0026_0FC2FDC3CEC3C130">they have now carried deceit and cruelty as far as any power upon earth, as America and the Ea&s;t-Indies have fully experienced. And the fathers of Plymouth colony, the fir&s;t in New-England, held to an internal call to preach the go&s;pel, and reject|ed external force to &s;upport religious mini&s;ters, until the year 1658. And the next year two men were hanged at Bo&s;ton, who&s;e <HI>blood</HI> hath cau&s;ed loud exclamations again&s;t our country ever &s;ince. Though it is a mo&s;t wicked thing for any to cen&s;ure our whole country, for the evils which were pro|duced by a practice which our fir&s;t fathers abhor|red. A practice which came from Rome, through England to America. And it is impo&s;&s;ible for any men to u&s;e force with others about the wor&s;hip of God, without injuring all tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ent from them. And though, while God was the only lawgiver for the church of I&s;rael, he re|quired that all adulterers, idolaters, and bla&s;phem|ers, &s;hould die without mercy; yet he never al|lowed them to u&s;e force in collecting provi&s;ion for his hou&s;e, or &s;upport for his mini&s;ters. Each man was to bring in the tithes and offerings that he re|quired, as he would de&s;ire the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and to e&s;cape his awful cur&s;e. This is fully evident in the twenty-&s;ixth, and twenty-&s;eventh chapters of Deuteronomy. And when they generally neg|lected his ordinances, after their return from cap|tivity, God &s;aid, Ye are <HI>cur&s;ed</HI> with a <HI>cur&s;e;</HI> for ye have <HI>robbed</HI> me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the &s;torehou&s;e, that there may be meat in mine hou&s;e, and prove me now herewith, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a <HI>ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> that there &s;hall not be room enough to receive it. Mal. iii. 7&mdash;10. At the &s;ame time he <HI>cur&s;ed the

Luke iv. 18&mdash;21.

But by <HI>confounding</HI> church and world together, which is <HI>Babylon,</HI> men have filled the world with hypocri&s;y and tyranny, under religious pretences.

And he &s;aid, To this end was I born, and for this cau&s;e came I into the world, that I &s;hould bear witne&s;s unto the <HI>truth.</HI> Every one that is of the <HI>truth,</HI> heareth my voice. John i. 17. xviii. 37. And &s;ays God to his children, I have not written unto you becau&s;e ye know not the <HI>truth;</HI> but becau&s;e ye know it, and that <HI>no lie is of the truth.</HI> 1 John ii. 21.

And &s;alvation is appointed for walls and for bulwarks around the righteous nation, who keep the truth. And God &s;ays, With the heart man believeth unto <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and with the mouth confe&s;&s;ion is made unto <HI>&s;alvation.</HI> Rom. x. 10. This is the only way into his church,

For the light of revelation enlarges the capacities of men, beyond any other means in the world; and where men in power have not had the truth of God rooted in their hearts, they have joined with fal&s;e teachers, in blinding the minds of the people again&s;t it, in order to gra&s;p all the honors and profits of the whole community to them&s;elves. So in I&s;rael God &s;aid, The prophets prophe&s;y fal&s;ely, and the prie&s;ts bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it &s;o: and what will ye do in the end thereof. Jer. v. 31. Wo unto you lawyers; for ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye entered not in your&s;elves, and them that were entering, ye hin|dered. Luke xi. 52. And no &s;uch men are &s;uit|able judges, about the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, but are per&s;ecuters of them. And <HI>carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, hardne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>piercing cruelty,</HI> like the highway, &s;toney, or thorny ground, is the character that our Lord gives of mo&s;t hearers of his word; while <HI>under&s;tanding, hone&s;ty,</HI> and <HI>patience,</HI> in bringing forth good fruit, is the character of all who receive the &s;eed into good ground. Mat. xiii. 14&mdash;23. Luke viii. 11&mdash;15. And a faithful mini&s;ter &s;aid, We are unto God a &s;weet &s;avour of Chri&s;t; in them that are &s;aved, and in them that peri&s;h. To the one we are the &s;av|our of death unto death; and to the other the &s;av|our of life unto life: and who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things? 2 Cor. ii. 15, 16. A que&s;tion which none can clearly an&s;wer, without faith in Chri&s;t, who &s;ays, <HI>My grace is &s;ufficient for thee.</HI> 2 Cor. xii. 9. God &s;uffered the magicians of Egypt to deceive Pharaoh, &s;o that he hardened his heart, again&s;t the command of God by Mo&s;es, to let I&s;rael go and
<PB N="39" REF="024062_0037_0FC2FDFB680404C0">&s;erve him. And he &s;ays of fal&s;e teachers under the go&s;pel, As Jannes and Jambres <HI>with&s;tood</HI> Mo&s;es, &s;o do the&s;e al&s;o <HI>re&s;i&s;t the truth;</HI> men of corrupt minds, <HI>reprobate</HI> concerning the faith. But they &s;hall pro|ceed no further; for their folly &s;hall be manife&s;t unto all men, as theirs al&s;o was. 2 Tim. iii. 8, 9. And is not this word now fulfilled? For the wi&s;|dom of the prudent is to <HI>under&s;tand</HI> his way; but the <HI>folly of fools is deceit.</HI> Prov. xiv. 8. And how is <HI>deceit</HI> now expo&s;ed in Europe and America! <HI>Fear</HI> moved the Egyptians to &s;end I&s;rael away with rich trea&s;ures, in the very night that God told Abraham of four hundred and thirty years before. Exod. xii. 29&mdash;41. P&s;alm cv. 37, 38. And if <HI>fear</HI> can do &s;uch great things, what will it do when united with the <HI>love of Chri&s;t</HI> in the heart? For this union forms the <HI>new creature.</HI> 2 Cor. v. 11&mdash;17. Therefore all men who profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian religi|on, without loving Chri&s;t above all creatures, are <HI>deceived.</HI> The other objection again&s;t the doctrine of knowing the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t by his pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing with them, is the great and boa&s;ted &s;uc|ce&s;s of many deceivers. But how little do &s;uch ob|jectors regard the words of our Lord? for he &s;ays, <HI>Ye &s;hall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thi&s;tles?</HI> Mat. vii. 15&mdash;23. A good man, out of the good trea&s;ure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil trea&s;ure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart, his mouth &s;peaketh. Luke vi. 45. When a baptized per&s;on offered money for power to convey the Holy Gho&s;t to others, by the laying on of his hands, Peter &s;aid, <HI>Thou ha&s;t neither part nor lot in this matter; for thy heart is not right in the &s;ight of God.</HI> Acts. viii. 21. His words di&s;|covered
<PB N="40" REF="024062_0038_0FC2FDFCED8A7A50">that he was a <HI>hypocrite,</HI> and no &s;uch have any right in the church of Chri&s;t. But mo&s;t teach|ers now in the world, de&s;pi&s;e the idea of enquiring after an inward change of heart, in order for the admi&s;&s;ion of any into the church, or into the min|i&s;try. External bapti&s;ms, and laying on of hands, without faith in Chri&s;t, who hath opened a foun|tain to wa&s;h our &s;ouls from &s;in, and bears away all our guilt, hath filled the church with <HI>briars</HI> and <HI>thorns.</HI> Heb. vi. 1&mdash;8. For the &s;ons of Belial &s;ent their &s;ervants to the people, &s;aying, Thou &s;halt give it me now; and if not, <HI>I will take it by force.</HI> 1 Sam. ii. 12, 16. And the &s;ons of Belial &s;hall be all of them as <HI>thorns</HI> thru&s;t away, becau&s;e they can|not be taken with hands. 2 Sam. xxiii. 6. And what concord hath Chri&s;t with Belial?&mdash;Come out from among them, and be ye <HI>&s;eparate,</HI> &s;aith the Lord. 2 Cor. vi. 15&mdash;17. <HI>Unbelievers</HI> &s;aid, <HI>We be not able.</HI> But <HI>believers,</HI> leaving &s;elf out of the que&s;tion, &s;aid, <HI>Their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us: fear them not.</HI> Num. xiii. 30&mdash;33. xiv. 6&mdash;9. And in reference to them, God calls us to <HI>hold fa&s;t the confidence, and the re|joicing of the hope firm unto the end;</HI> and not to <HI>harden our hearts,</HI> as tho&s;e unbelievers did. Heb. iii. 5&mdash;11. For they who wor&s;hip the bea&s;t, tread the <HI>holy city</HI> under foot, and &s;ay, Who is like unto the bea&s;t? who is <HI>able</HI> to make war with him? Rev. xi. 2. xiii. 4. Men who judge for reward, teach for hire, and divine for money, act upon neg|atives, and &s;ay, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. Micah iii. 11. But God &s;ays, Who hath <HI>required</HI> this at your hand to tread my courts?&mdash;Your hands are full of <HI>blood.</HI> I&s;aiah i. 12, 15. And how much <HI>blood</HI> hath lately been &s;hed in our land?</P>

The church of Chri&s;t is a <HI>holy city,</HI> which is the <HI>light of the world.</HI> Mat. v. 14&mdash;16. But &s;he hath been clothed with &s;ackcloth or <HI>mourning,</HI> ever &s;ince the bea&s;t aro&s;e out of the bottomle&s;s pit. She is <HI>one city,</HI> as all the &s;aints make but <HI>one church.</HI> But while on earth they are many <HI>cities,</HI> or <HI>churches.</HI> A city is a corporation, inve&s;ted with power to govern all within its limits, and to expel all from it, who refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to their government. And &s;uch is the power which Chri&s;t gives to every one of his churches, as we have before proved. And he &s;ays, The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becau&s;e the Lord hath <HI>anointed</HI> me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath &s;ent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on to them that are bound: to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that <HI>mourn.</HI>&mdash;And they &s;hall build the old wa&s;tes, they &s;hall rai&s;e up the former de&s;o|lations, they &s;hall repair the <HI>wa&s;te cities, the de&s;o|lations of many generations.</HI> The men who &s;hall do this great work are the <HI>poor in &s;pirit,</HI> the <HI>mourn|ers,</HI> the <HI>meek,</HI> they who <HI>hunger and thir&s;t after righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> are <HI>merciful, pure in heart, peace-makers,</HI> and <HI>per&s;ecuted for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake.</HI> Mat. v. 3&mdash;14. The&s;e are the only <HI>judges</HI> in the church of Chri&s;t, which will be <HI>light indeed.</HI> For <HI>judgment</HI> will then take place, and <HI>robbery</HI> be excluded from the church of Chri&s;t, in the &s;upport of his mini&s;ters. This is the go&s;pel which he <HI>proclaimed</HI> to &s;inful men, with <HI>vengeance</HI> upon all who rejected his <HI>proclamation.</HI> I&s;aiah lxi. 1&mdash;8. Luke iv. 18&mdash;21. <HI>Offer</HI> of the go&s;pel, in&s;tead of the word <HI>proclaim</HI> or <HI>preach,</HI> hath deceived multitudes with a conceit, that it con|tained privileges which they might now receive,
<PB N="42" REF="024062_0040_0FC2FE0A86F46540">or not, as they may any thing which men <HI>offer</HI> to them. Whereas the go&s;pel is a proclamation of grace, which co&s;t Chri&s;t his precious <HI>blood;</HI> and he &s;ays, <HI>Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of &s;alvation.</HI> 2 Cor. v. 21. vi. 1, 2. Therefore we ought to give the more earne&s;t heed to the things which we have heard, le&s;t at any time we &s;hould let them &s;lip. For if the word &s;poken by angels was &s;tedfa&s;t, and every tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion and di&s;obedience received a ju&s;t recompen&s;e of reward, how &s;hall we e&s;cape if we <HI>neglect &s;o great &s;alvation,</HI> which at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God al&s;o bearing them witne&s;s, both with &s;igns and wonders and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, according to his own will? Heb. ii. 1&mdash;4. The pa&s;&s;over was to be kept without <HI>leaven;</HI> and God &s;aid, The man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and <HI>forbeareth</HI> to keep the pa&s;&s;over, even that &s;ame &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from his people, becau&s;e he brought not the offering of the Lord in his <HI>appointed &s;ea&s;on:</HI> that &s;oul &s;hall bear his &s;in. Exod. xii. 15. Num. ix. 13. <HI>Hypocri&s;y, malice and wickedne&s;s,</HI> is the <HI>leaven</HI> which God commands us to <HI>purge out,</HI> as we would de|&s;ire to enjoy his pre&s;ence, and to e&s;cape his <HI>judg|ments,</HI> even &s;ickne&s;s and death. Luke xii. 1. 1 Cor. v. 7, 8. xi. 30&mdash;32. For the time is come that judgment mu&s;t begin at the hou&s;e of God: and if it fir&s;t begin at us, what &s;hall the end be of them that obey not the go&s;pel of God? and if the righ|teous &s;carcely be &s;aved, where &s;hall the ungodly and the &s;inner appear? 1 Peter iv. 17, 18.</P>
<P>The&s;e are que&s;tions which ought to alarm every &s;oul. For all the troubles of the righteous, which they meet with in this world, are becau&s;e of their
<PB N="43" REF="024062_0041_0FC2FE142B064458">own &s;ins, or the iniquity of others; and if they are &s;aved with &s;o much difficulty, where will tho&s;e ap|pear who indulge known &s;in, and neglect known duty, to avoid pre&s;ent trouble? They might as ra|tionally yield to enemies to e&s;cape danger, or drink poi&s;on to pre&s;erve health. For <HI>deceit</HI> is the <HI>poi&s;on of a&s;ps.</HI> Rom. iii. 13. And faith in the blood of Chri&s;t, is the only remedy again&s;t all &s;uch poi&s;on. His blood will purge the con&s;cience from dead works, to &s;erve the living God. If we &s;ay that we have no &s;in we <HI>deceive</HI> our&s;elves, and the <HI>truth</HI> is not in us. If we confe&s;s our &s;ins, he is <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t</HI> to forgive our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. 1 John i. 8, 9. And how far is each one from <HI>hone&s;ty,</HI> who will not confe&s;s his &s;ins to God? And how great is the privilege for it un|der the go&s;pel? Under the law, none might be prie&s;ts but the lawful &s;eed of Aaron; but under the go&s;pel, every penitent believer is made a king and a prie&s;t unto God. Rev. i. 5, 6. And it is a mo&s;t pernicious delu&s;ion, for any man to think he can be a prie&s;t unto God, without faith in the blood of Chri&s;t, and a life of devotedne&s;s to his &s;ervice. But all who are thus devoted to him, are both kings and prie&s;ts; and the government of the church of Chri&s;t belongs to them, <HI>independent</HI> of all the world be&s;ides. Therefore no man can be &s;afely received as a religious teacher, who is not a member of &s;ome particular church, who can cen|&s;ure and exclude him, if he breaks any of the laws of Chri&s;t. For Chri&s;t plainly commended the church of Ephe&s;us for &s;o doing; and Paul appeal|ed to the church of Corinth, again&s;t <HI>deceitful teach|ers.</HI> 2 Cor. xi. 13. xiii. 1&mdash;3. And who will dare to claim a power above Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles! For if the church had not been a&s;leep, iniquity
<PB N="44" REF="024062_0042_0FC2FE181D644AC0">could not have prevailed as it hath done. But our apo&s;tle &s;ays, It is high time to <HI>awake out of &s;leep;</HI> for now is our &s;alvation nearer than when we be|lieved. The night is far &s;pent, the day is at hand: let us therefore ca&s;t off the works of darkne&s;s, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk <HI>hone&s;tly</HI> as in the day; not in rioting and drunk|enne&s;s, not in chambering and wantonne&s;s, not in &s;trife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and make not provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to ful|fil the lu&s;ts thereof. Rom. xiii. 11&mdash;14. If he were truly obeyed, glory would &s;oon dwell in our land.</P>
