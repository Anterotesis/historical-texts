<Q><BIBL><HI>LUKE II. 41, 42.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Now his parents went to Jeru&s;alem every year at the fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over; and when He was twelve years old they went up to Jeru|&s;alem after the cu&s;tom of the fea&s;t.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a &s;weet and plea&s;ant <HI>Chapter</HI> before us, fill'd with a grateful variety re&s;pect|ing the birth and circumci&s;ion of our <HI>Lord Je&s;us,</HI> and his pre&s;entation in the Temple; how the <HI>multitudes of the heavenly Ho&s;ts</HI> prai&s;ed God on the one occa&s;ion, and how <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Anna</HI> &s;pake of him on the other.</P>
<P>IN the ver&s;e before my text we have a &s;hort account of the infancy and childhood of our <HI>Lord,</HI> ver. 40. <HI>And the child grew, and waxed
<PB N="2" REF="002854_0004_0FE6790548C915A0">&s;trong in &s;pirit, filled with wi&s;dom and the grace of God was upon him.</HI> This was indeed as be|came the <HI>Son of God:</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> on the place.</NOTE> "That whereas other children are <HI>weak</HI> in under&s;tanding and re&s;o|lution He was <HI>strong</HI> in &s;pirit; whereas other children have <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI> bound up in their hearts, which appears in all they &s;ay and do, He was filled with <HI>wi&s;dom;</HI> and whereas the <HI>corruption</HI> of nature early and &s;trongly appears in other children, nothing but the <HI>grace</HI> of God appear'd in him".</P>
<P>"MY text begins the <HI>only</HI> pa&s;&s;age of &s;tory recorded concerning our ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Lord,</HI> from his infancy to the day of his &s;hewing to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> at 29 years of age". The <HI>parents</HI> of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> are the per&s;ons here &s;poken of; <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> &s;o reputed and called, and <HI>Mary</HI> his holy mo|ther. The thing related of them is very wor|thy and honourable; namely, their con&s;tant annual journey to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> at the fea&s;t of the <HI>pa&s;&s;over.</HI> This was required of the <HI>males</HI> by the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> but the women were excu|&s;ed. Yet they that would attended, and the Mother of Chri&s;t was too devout not to do it. She was &s;trong in body, as well as in &s;pirit, by the favour of God, and was as con&s;tant at the fea&s;t as her gracious husband. (A <HI>fea&s;t</HI> which had mo&s;t of Go&s;pel in it, and to which &s;he was more related than &s;he knew of; her holy Son being the <HI>lamb of God,</HI> the great Antitype of all the <HI>pa&s;chal</HI> lambs.) Such (&s;ays Mr.
<PB N="3" REF="002854_0005_0FE678970562D860"><HI>Burkit</HI>) as will go no further than they are forc'd in religious exerci&s;es, are &s;trangers to the <HI>Virgins</HI> piety and devotion.</P>
<P>BUT here is <HI>one</HI> particular year &s;pecified when <HI>Je&s;us</HI> went up with them to the fea&s;t. It was when he was <HI>twelve</HI> years old. It is not &s;aid that he had not gone up with them any year before that: it may be this was not the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time; as doubtle&s;s it was not the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> tho' it be the only time we read of.</P>
<P>"THE <HI>Jews</HI> tell us that at <HI>thirteen</HI> year old a child was reputed with them <HI>a Son of the commandment:</HI> that is to &s;ay, obliged to the duties of <HI>adult Church member&s;hip;</HI> having been from his infancy and circumci&s;ion a Son of the <HI>covenant.</HI>" Now <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in his child|hood being &s;o much in wi&s;dom and &s;pirit a|bove his years, we may well &s;uppo&s;e that 'ere this time he had been at the <HI>pa&s;&s;over.</HI> But this time is recorded and not the re&s;t, for the &s;ake of that wonderful conference which he now had with the <HI>Doctors</HI> in the Temple.</P>
<P>I might offer many profitable <HI>Notes</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> from the text, but &s;hall &s;elect <HI>four</HI> only to &s;peak to.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT the con&s;tant devout ob&s;ervation of the fea&s;t of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over,</HI> was &s;trictly re|quired of the <HI>Jews.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT the religious among them were very <HI>strict</HI> in the ob&s;ervation of it, and of the other religious fea&s;ts, &s;tatutes and ordinances of that di&s;pen&s;ation.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="4" REF="002854_0006_0FE6789E61932760">
3. THAT <HI>parents</HI> &s;hould take care to go before their children in the ob&s;ervation of Divine in&s;titutions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. THAT <HI>children</HI> &s;hould be early in the wor&s;hip of God; and in their preparation for an approach to the table of Chri&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. <HI>THAT the con&s;tant and devout ob&s;ervation of the pa&s;&s;over was &s;trictly required of the Jews.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THREE</HI> times in a year they were to keep a fea&s;t unto the Lord; when all their <HI>males</HI> were to appear before him. Exod. 23.14, 17. This was a &s;tatute for <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and a law of the God of <HI>Jacob.</HI> The fea&s;t of <HI>unleavened bread,</HI> which was the <HI>pa&s;&s;over,</HI> was the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and chief of the&s;e <HI>three</HI> great fe&s;tivals. It was in&s;tituted to the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> upon the day of their coming out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to be a &s;tanding memorial to them thro'out their generations of that their deliverance &amp; redemption. Exod. 12.14. <HI>This day &s;hall be unto you for a memorial, and ye &s;hall keep it a fea&s;t unto the Lord thro'out your generations; you &s;hall keep it a fea&s;t by an ordi|nance for ever.</HI> Deut. 16.3. That thou may'&s;t remember the day wherein <HI>thou came&s;t forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.</HI></P>
<P>THE omi&s;&s;ion or neglect of this in&s;titution was very &s;everely threatned by God. Num. 9.13. <HI>But the man that is clean and not in a Journey, and forbeareth to keep the pa&s;&s;over, even the &s;ame &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from his people: be|cau&s;e he brought not the offering of the Lord in
<PB N="5" REF="002854_0007_0FE6459D461DC008">his appointed &s;ea&s;on, that man &s;hall bear his &s;in.</HI> Nothing could excu&s;e a jew from this appoin|ted &s;ervice, but his being under &s;ome legal uncleanne&s;s which rendred him unfit for it; or his being &s;ick or in a journey which made it impracticable for him to be at the Lord's place: And in this ca&s;e it was provided, that &s;uch a per&s;on &s;hould keep the pa&s;&s;over a month after the appointed time. So carefully did the law provide again&s;t the <HI>omi&s;&s;ion</HI> of the duty required. Numb. 9.10, 11. <HI>If any man of you, or of your posterity &s;hall be unclean by rea&s;on of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he &s;hall keep the pa&s;&s;over unto the Lord; the fourteenth day of the &s;econd month, at even, &s;hall they keep it.</HI> And the ordinance was the &s;ame for the <HI>&s;tranger,</HI> a pro&s;elyte of the jewi&s;h re|ligion, as for him that was <HI>born</HI> in the land. Num. 9.14. Only the <HI>profanation</HI> or carele&s;s performance of this holy &s;ervice was al&s;o as &s;trictly forbidden and &s;everely condemned: Levit. 7.20. <HI>The &s;oul that eateth of the fle&s;h of the &s;acrifice of peace offerings that pertain unto the Lord, having his uncleanne&s;s upon him, even that &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from his people.</HI> And yet where there was a <HI>preparation of heart,</HI> and &s;omething unavoidable hinder'd the exact ceremonial purifications which the law pre|&s;cribed, and which the wor&s;hipper would have complied with if he could; in &s;uch a ca&s;e (upon extraordinary occa&s;ions) the gracious God &s;ometimes excu&s;ed the want of <HI>legal puri|fication,</HI> and accepted the wor&s;hipper and his
<PB N="6" REF="002854_0008_0FE6789E86AEC508">&s;ervice: As it was the ca&s;e of many of the people in <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s great pa&s;&s;over. 2 Chron. 30.18. <HI>A multitude of the people out of Ephraim, I&s;&s;achar and Zebulun, had not clean&s;ed them|&s;elves; yet did they cat the pa&s;&s;over otherwi&s;e than it was written: but Hezekiah prayed for them, &s;aying, The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to &s;eek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not clean&s;ed ac|cording to the purification of the &s;anctuary: And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah and healed the people.</HI></P>
<P>THUS &s;trictly has God always required of his people <HI>obedience</HI> to his po&s;itive laws, and the careful <HI>ob&s;ervation</HI> of his &s;tatutes and or|dinances.</P>
<P>I will not now go into the <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> of this &s;everity of the Law in the&s;e injunctions. It might be &s;aid,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. SUCH po&s;itive laws, &s;tatutes and ordi|nances are the high declarations of God's <HI>do|minion</HI> and &s;overeighty, his ab&s;olute <HI>will</HI> and authority; and He will be obey'd and ought to be &s;o. It is indignity and rebellion for us to he&s;itate or delay when we know his will.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THEY are the in&s;tances of that <HI>open ho|nour</HI> and publick acknowledgement, which as a <HI>church</HI> and people of God we render to him; whereby he is confe&s;&s;ed in &s;olemn and &s;tated manner, glorified before others, and all are provoked to glorify him.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="7" REF="002854_0009_0FE6789FEB5C7AA8">
3. THEY are &s;tanding memorials of his <HI>grace</HI> favour and mercy to a people, of his <HI>pre&s;ence</HI> among them and of his <HI>covenant</HI> with them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>AND to the people of God they are the or|dained <HI>&s;igns</HI> and appointed <HI>means</HI> of their &s;a|cred covenanting with God, and &s;pecial com|munion with Him.</P>
<P>BUT there needs no more to be &s;aid than this, <HI>What if God will? and who &s;hall &s;ay to him, what doe&s;t thou?</HI> He never ask'd his crea|ture what law he &s;hould give him. And whatever it be, 'tis to be &s;ure holy and ju&s;t. And the penalty in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience can be no le&s;s than exci&s;ion from God; which is to &s;ay everla&s;ting infinite mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>NOW that which remains is to bring home this matter to <HI>our &s;elves,</HI> and argue from the <HI>Lord's pa&s;&s;over</HI> under the law, unto his <HI>holy &s;upper</HI> under the go&s;pel. For certainly the&s;e <HI>two &s;acramental rites</HI> or actions do bear a great affinity likene&s;s and relation one to the other; and what the one was to the church under the <HI>law,</HI> &s;uch the other is to it under the <HI>go&s;pel.</HI> And it is very manife&s;t in the in&s;titu|tion of the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> as from the nature of the thing, &s;o from the time and circum|&s;tances of it, that it comes in the place and room of the <HI>po&s;&s;over;</HI> by the will of Him who is the Lord our pa&s;&s;over &s;acrificed for us. And our <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> has po&s;itively and ab|&s;olutely required of us both the ob&s;ervation and &s;anctification of this ordinance of the <HI>Supper,</HI> as he did enjoyn that of the <HI>pa&s;&s;over</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002854_0010_0FE678A0181F00C8">under the law. It is his &s;pecial law to us now, as much as that was to them by the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> He has &s;aid to us, <HI>This do ye in remembrance of me:</HI> And his <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> has &s;aid to us, <HI>I received of the Lord,</HI> that which I delivered unto you, <HI>that the Lord Je&s;us</HI> the &s;ame night in which he was betrayed <HI>took bread</HI> &amp;c. It is therefore called the <HI>Lord's table</HI> and the <HI>Lord's &s;upper.</HI> His <HI>authority</HI> has appointed it, and it is a &s;tanding memorial of his <HI>love,</HI> a publick and perpetual <HI>honour</HI> to his name; and to us the &s;tated &s;ign and means of our <HI>covenanting</HI> and communion with him.</P>
<P>AND if the&s;e things be &s;o, then what can we think or &s;ay, in excu&s;e of the ea&s;ie <HI>neglect</HI> and <HI>carele&s;s</HI> ob&s;ervation of this ordinance a|mong <HI>Chri&s;tians?</HI> Will not the <HI>Lord Chri&s;t</HI> as much enquire after and require for <HI>this</HI> thing among us, as he did of old among his people about the <HI>pa&s;&s;over?</HI> Certainly he will. And the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> therefore &s;ays all tho&s;e awful words on this occa&s;ion, 1 Corin. 11. <HI>ult. Let a man examine him&s;elf and &s;o let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup: for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judg|ment to him&s;elf: for this cau&s;e many are weak and &s;ickly among you and many &s;leep: for if we would judge our &s;elves we &s;hould not be judged.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;um then is, That people &s;hould not dare to live in the <HI>neglect</HI> of the <HI>Lord's table,</HI> as they commonly do; and that they &s;hould be very <HI>devout</HI> and &s;piritual, very <HI>careful</HI> and &s;erious in the ob&s;ervation of it: as the <HI>Jews</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="002854_0011_0FE6788FE4251510">of old were obliged to be very con&s;tant and careful in their attendance on the <HI>pa&s;&s;over fea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. MY next <HI>note</HI> is, <HI>That the Religious a|mong the Jews were very strict and exact in the ob&s;ervation of the pa&s;&s;over,</HI> and other po&s;itive ordinances of the law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>MY text informs us that the <HI>parents of Chri&s;t</HI> were &s;o: <HI>Every year they went up at the fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over,</HI> and they <HI>fulfilled the days,</HI> and <HI>performed all things according to the law of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>"NO difficulties hinder'd their attendance; they came up <HI>early</HI> to it, and <HI>&s;taid</HI> all the time of it. Neither <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s calling, nor the ble&s;|&s;ed <HI>Virgins</HI> hou&s;hold bu&s;ine&s;s could keep them at home, nor ha&s;ten 'em home, before the &s;er|vice was entirely over. All worldly bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t give place to divine offices, and we mu&s;t attend God's &s;ervice to the end of it, if we would carry away the ble&s;&s;ing.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">kitt</HI> in loc.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is indeed no evidence of the <HI>truth</HI> of grace to frequent the publick a&s;&s;emblies; yet it is an infallible &s;ign of the <HI>want</HI> of grace cu&s;tomarily to neglect them. We read of the holy parents of <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> namely <HI>Ze|charias</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth, that they were both righ|teous before God, walking in all the command|ments and ordinances of the Lord, blamele&s;s.</HI> This is a high and happy account of <HI>husband</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002854_0012_0FE678A6DFBB90D0">and <HI>wife,</HI> and it &s;hould be &s;aid of every mar|ried couple: If they <HI>would</HI> be righteous before God they &s;hould be walking together in all the ordinances of the Lord blamele&s;s; and if they <HI>are</HI> righteous before God they will do &s;o. Such a happy pair were <HI>Elkanah</HI> and <HI>Hannah;</HI> they <HI>went up yearly to wor&s;hip and to &s;acrifice unto the Lord of Hosts in Shiloh: &s;o they did year by year,</HI> 1 Sam. 1.3, 7. Indeed multitudes did thus attend the yearly fea&s;ts in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> who were not pious people, and &s;ome who were irreligious did no doubt neglect them, but <HI>all</HI> that were pious went up to the &s;olemn fea&s;ts. <HI>David</HI> &s;ings of their doing &s;o in &s;ome of his mo&s;t plea&s;ant <HI>p&s;alms:</HI> P&s;al. 42. &amp; 122. <HI>I was glad when they &s;aid to me, let us go into the hou&s;e of the Lord: our feet &s;hall &s;tand within thy gates, O Jeru&s;alem! whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the te&s;timony of I&s;rael, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord: For I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the hou&s;e of God, with the voice of joy and prai&s;e; with a multitude that kept holy-day.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>reflections</HI> which now naturally occur to us are &s;uch as the&s;e. How comes it to pa&s;s that we <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> are not as <HI>careful</HI> and exact, as <HI>con&s;tant</HI> and con&s;cientious in attending on the ordinance of the <HI>Lord's &s;upper;</HI> as the <HI>Jews</HI> were in the ob&s;ervation of the <HI>pa&s;&s;over</HI> and other ordinances of the <HI>law?</HI> Should not a People profe&s;&s;ing the name of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hew their reverend and religious regard to the <HI>memorial of his death?</HI> and &s;hould not people
<PB N="11" REF="002854_0013_0FE678A704DE23B8">of gravity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in the chri&s;tian Church hold them&s;elves bound and tied up by the command of their <HI>dying Saviour?</HI> For if the <HI>Law</HI> given by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was reverend and awful, is it not yet more &s;o when the <HI>Son of God</HI> him&s;elf is come, and has &s;poken to us? And are not his la&s;t will and words, ju&s;t be|fore he died, memorable indeed and &s;acred? When God told <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> of a <HI>Prophet like to him,</HI> but greater, whom he <HI>would rai&s;e up</HI> to his people, and <HI>put his word in his mouth;</HI> he ad|ded &mdash; <HI>And who&s;oever will not hearken to my words which he &s;hall &s;peak in my name, I will re|quire it of him.</HI> Now make the application in <HI>this</HI> particular in&s;tance. The <HI>great Prophet</HI> of the church has come and &s;poken to us in the name of God, and one of his la&s;t words was this, <HI>Do this in remembrance of me:</HI> and if we do <HI>not hearken to the&s;e words</HI> which He has &s;poken to us, God &s;ays <HI>he will require it:</HI> and when he requires an account of us, why we did it not, what &s;hall we <HI>an&s;wer?</HI> we mu&s;t be <HI>&s;peechle&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>HEAR what the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> &s;ays on this head thro' his epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews: Therefore</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, le&s;t at any time we &s;hould let them &s;lip: For if the word &s;poken by angels was &s;tedfa&s;t, and every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;obedience received a ju&s;t recompence of reward; how &s;hall we e&s;cape if we neglect &s;o great &s;alva|tion;

<P>THIS is the <HI>strain</HI> of that excellent <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> It calls upon the <HI>Chri&s;tian church</HI> to be as ob&s;ervant of the In&s;titutions of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> ever were of the law of <HI>Mo&s;es:</HI> It &s;hows that our obligations ri&s;e higher than theirs, and that it will be wor&s;e in us and for us to be inob&s;ervant than it ever was in them, or will be for them in the day of judgment.</P>
<P>I will only add <HI>two</HI> more reflections here,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT we be <HI>caution'd</HI> not to re&s;t our &s;elves in the meer <HI>outward</HI> ob&s;ervation of God's ordinances, as the <HI>Jews</HI> generally did: and as
<PB N="14" REF="002854_0016_0FE678B0A4505F18">the generality of chri&s;tians do thro' <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> at this day: But let us remember that as he <HI>was not a Jew that was one outwardy in the fle&s;h,</HI> &s;o he only is a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> that is one <HI>inwardly,</HI> and bapti&s;m is <HI>that of the heart, in the &s;pirit and not in the letter, who&s;e prai&s;e is not of men but of God,</HI> Rom. 2.29. And again, let us re|member the &s;ame <HI>Apostle</HI>'s words, Phil. 3 3. <HI>We are the circumci&s;ion that wor&s;hip God in the &s;pirit, and rejoice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and have no confidence in the fle&s;h.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. REMEMBER that in&s;tead of doing <HI>le&s;s</HI> than what the law of God requires of us in outward ob&s;ervations, we &s;hould rather do <HI>more.</HI> I mean not by <HI>inventions</HI> of our own, or in way of <HI>addition</HI> to the commandments of God; but in the devour <HI>ob&s;ervation</HI> of tho&s;e which God has appointed. As in the <HI>text;</HI> altho' <HI>Mary</HI> was not obliged by the law to go up yearly to the pa&s;&s;over with her husband; yet the law permitting her to go &s;he gladly went, as <HI>Hannah</HI> and other holy women were wont to do before her.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>AND thus the <HI>fir&s;t Christians</HI> having receiv|ed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> about his <HI>Supper</HI> (the <HI>breaking of bread</HI> in remembrance of <HI>his broken body</HI>) they not only <HI>&s;tedfa&s;tly continued</HI> in this doctrine and fellow&s;hip of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> but they did it <HI>daily, from hou&s;e to hou&s;e,</HI> with a &s;ingle and joyful heart, Acts 2.42, 46. As of|ten as they came together it &s;eems to have been to break bread; the <HI>Lord's day</HI> &amp; the <HI>Lord's &s;upper</HI> met together: <HI>Acts</HI> 20.7. <HI>Upon the
<PB N="15" REF="002854_0017_0FE67889B7F9E908">fir&s;t day of the week, when the di&s;ciples came to|gether to break bread, Paul preached.</HI></P>
<P>GOD has not tied us up to &s;o many preci&s;e times, ju&s;t how often to pray, and hear and communicate: We &s;hould be &s;ure then rather to go beyond the law, than to come &s;hort of its injunctions, in the di&s;charging of the&s;e duties. And if &s;o, then when the go&s;pel &s;ays, As <HI>often</HI> as ye eat this bread, (which &s;uppo&s;es we do it often) what will they &s;ay to them|&s;elves, who have never <HI>once</HI> done it?</P>
<P>BUT this for the <HI>&s;econd Note,</HI> That the <HI>re|ligious</HI> among the <HI>Jews</HI> were con&s;tant and de|vout in the &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the <HI>pa&s;&s;over: Every year they went up at the feast,</HI> and took care to do every thing <HI>after the cu&s;tom of the fea&s;t.</HI> The next <HI>Note</HI> that I would offer is this,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>THAT parents &s;hould go before their chil|dren in the ob&s;ervation of the holy Institutions of God in his wor&s;hip.</HI> So did the gracious <HI>Pa|rents</HI> in the text; and if they had had a fa|mily of children and &s;ervants to have learn'd of them, their landable example would have well in&s;tituted them in the ob&s;ervation of the pa&s;&s;over. And truly &s;o ought <HI>Chri&s;tian parents</HI> to lead their hou&s;houlds to the <HI>table of Chri&s;t,</HI> and in the reverend &s;anctification of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and a religious ob&s;ervation of all the <HI>Ordinan|ces</HI> of God's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THE word of God requires parents <HI>diligently to teach their children</HI> the will and ways of
<PB N="16" REF="002854_0018_0FE678B0C966D858">God, as well as to have the &s;ame always in <HI>their own hearts,</HI> Deut. 6.6, 7. And when the <HI>pa&s;&s;over</HI> was fir&s;t appointed to the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> it was accompanied with this precept to them, Exod. 13.8, 14. <HI>And thou &s;halt &s;hew thy &s;on in that day, &s;aying, This is done becau&s;e of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt: And it &s;hall be for a &s;ign un|to thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial be|tween thy eyes; that the Lord's law may be in thy mouth; for with a &s;trong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>CHILDREN naturally enquire and learn of their parents; but more of their examples as they grow up than they do of their precepts. If then it be the duty of parents to teach by words, it is more their duty to teach by their practice and good example. If they &s;hould take pains to in&s;truct them in the rea&s;ons of God's laws, and in the meaning of his ordi|nances, and require them to ob&s;erve the &s;ame, much more &s;hould they teach and lead 'em by their own example. For with what face or with what efficacy can a parent tell his &s;on, that Chri&s;t has required &s;uch a duty and &s;er|vice, and as he grows up he mu&s;t be &s;ure to ob&s;erve it; and yet let his child &s;ee that he lives in the neglect of that duty him&s;elf. It is incumbent therefore on parents, that they teach and lead their children in the wor&s;hip of God by their own example; that they go before them in the reverend ob&s;ervation of his holy in&s;titutions.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002854_0019_0FE678B20CCE5200">
SO did <HI>Abraham:</HI> He fir&s;t circumci&s;ed him|&s;elf, and then his &s;on, and his hou&s;hold: And this is the honour done him by God; <HI>Gen.</HI> 18.19. <HI>I know Abraham that he will command his children and hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the way of the Lord.</HI> He could command them with authority &amp; efficacy when he fir&s;t obeyed him&s;elf: his words had not el&s;e come with power and been receiv'd with reverence.</P>
<P><HI>DAVID</HI> could with authority in&s;truct his &s;on in the ordinances of God, becau&s;e he him|&s;elf was &s;o great a lover of them, &s;o devout an ob&s;erver of them. His being a <HI>King</HI> did not give &s;o much power to his words as his being a Saint. Prov. 4.3. <HI>I was my fathers &s;on, tender and only beloved in the &s;ight of my mother; he taught me al&s;o and &s;aid unto me, Let thine heart retain my words, keep my commandments and live.</HI></P>
<P>SO the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> taught the <HI>Churches</HI> effectual|ly; Phil. 4.9. <HI>Tho&s;e things which ye have both learned and received, and heard and &s;een in me do: and the God of peace &s;hall be with you.</HI></P>
<P>SO <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> taught his family, and all that are <HI>his</HI> ought &s;o to teach theirs. John 13.15. <HI>I have given you an example.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREFORE let parents fir&s;t take <HI>heed</HI> to them&s;elves, and then take <HI>care</HI> of their chil|dren. For if they require their children to reverence the In&s;titutions of God and do not ob&s;erve the &s;ame them&s;elves, perhaps their children will &s;oon lo&s;e all reverence both to God and them. Or if parents &s;ay nothing to
<PB N="18" REF="002854_0020_0FE678B2309ADF00">their children about the matter, as it is like|ly they will not, then the honour their chil|dren do naturally bear <HI>them</HI> will tempt them to make light of the di&s;honour done to <HI>God</HI> in the neglect of his ordinances.</P>
<P>LET tho&s;e parents con&s;ider this who live in the neglect of the <HI>Lord's &s;upper</HI> in the &s;ight of their children. Think you, that they do not ob&s;erve and mind it? Yes, and will be ready to take any licence which your example gives them. It ought therefore to be a tender argument with parents to be religious for the &s;ake of their <HI>children:</HI> for next to their own <HI>Souls</HI> are the&s;e. But if men will not be pre|vail'd on for the &s;ake of their <HI>own</HI> &s;ouls, how &s;hould they by being pleaded with for the children of their bowels? It is to be fear'd that parents who do not come to the <HI>Lord's table,</HI> do not &s;peak at all to their children a|bout preparing for it: or if they do it can be with little force.</P>
<P>BUT the injury is greater to <HI>God,</HI> who gives us our children with this charge, to bring them up for <HI>Him;</HI> and intru&s;ts us with them as &s;o many living &s;ouls which are more <HI>His</HI> than ours. And if we fondly love their little bodies, but are negligent of their precious &s;ouls, as it is a brutal and irreligious thing in us, &s;o he will require it of us; as he did of his people of old: Ezek. 16.20. <HI>Thou ha&s;t taken thy &s;ons and thy daughters, whom thou hast born unto Me, and tho&s;e ha&s;t thou &s;acrificed to
<PB N="19" REF="002854_0021_0FE678B7EE4E6A78">thine idols, to be devoured: thou hast &s;lain my children.</HI></P>
<P>THE mo&s;t unnatural wrong we can do to our children is to neglect and hurt their <HI>&s;ouls:</HI> And this is one of the greate&s;t wrongs we can do to God, who challenges a &s;pecial property in our children; and therefore he has ap|pointed us that as &s;oon as they are born we do give them up to him, and bind our &s;elves to educate them for him. O the pitile&s;s as well as profane hearts of tho&s;e parents that neglect their own and their childrens &s;ouls! they in effect &s;acrifice 'em to devils after they have devoted them to God! they rob God of his children, and rob them of their title to God and his covenant ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>Finally, WHAT an <HI>unnatural precept</HI> and direction mu&s;t be given to the children of &s;uch parents, who live in the open neglect of the ordinances of Chri&s;t? How hard is it to be forc'd to &s;ay to your children, &mdash; and yet we mu&s;t &s;ay it &mdash; <HI>Do not learn of your parents in this thing!</HI> do not imitate 'em; they do wrong, very wrong, and you mu&s;t not follow them. This would be <HI>har&s;h</HI> kind of doctrine, and mu&s;t needs &s;ound &s;o in the ears both of parents and children. Yet if parents will live in the neglect of the Lord's ordinances, we mu&s;t &s;peak thus to their children. "Do not think to excu&s;e your &s;elves by your pa|rents example, how much &s;o ever you love and honour them: It will not do in the day of Chri&s;t: <HI>the &s;oul that &s;ins &s;hall die; the &s;oul
<PB N="20" REF="002854_0022_0FE678B814FBA4A0">of the father and the &s;oul of the &s;on:</HI> Ezek. 18.4. You mu&s;t mourn for your parents in the ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed and pray for them; and you may reverently ask of them the cau&s;e and rea|&s;on of their neglect, and be&s;eech them to lead you to all the ordinances of Chri&s;t; but if you prevail not on them be not di&s;couraged your &s;elf, and re&s;trained from doing your duty.</P>
<P>BUT this for the third <HI>Note:</HI> Parents &s;hould go before their children in the ob&s;er|vation of the in&s;titutions of Divine wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>CHILDREN ought to be early in the Wor|&s;hip of God, and preparing for the Table of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is taught us by our <HI>Lord's example</HI> in the text: the <HI>Child Je&s;us</HI> when he was <HI>twelve</HI> years old, went up with <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> to the fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over. And we read that <HI>he tarried behind in Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and when they found him it was <HI>in the Temple,</HI> and when they rea&s;oned with him upon his &s;taying there his an&s;wer was, <HI>Wa&s;t ye not that I must be about my Fathers bu&s;ine&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>CERTAINLY the holy Child <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is here exhibited as an example to children and young people; to teach and require them to give God an early po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;ouls, and in their youth to keep clo&s;e to his wor|&s;hip and &s;ervice. "E&s;pecially &s;uch children as are forward in other things, &s;hould be put forward in religion". It is the plea&s;ure of Chri&s;t and much for his honour, that chil|dren &s;hould be betimes in the temple, and
<PB N="21" REF="002854_0023_0FE678BA2E308238">that young people &s;hould be at his table.</P>
<P>IN the 22. <HI>ver&s;e</HI> of the <HI>chapter</HI> we read how the parents of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> brought him in his early infancy to pre&s;ent him in the temple, and to offer as the law required: And now in the <HI>text</HI> we find him coming in his early youth to the temple, to dedicate him&s;elf to the Lord in his appointed way. So tho&s;e of our children that are in their infancy dedica|ted to God in bapti&s;m, &s;hould be call'd upon as they grow up to come to the <HI>Go&s;pel pa&s;&s;over,</HI> the Lord's &s;upper, and joyn them&s;elves to the Lord and his Church by their own act and deed. But let them take care to do it with knowledge and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>SOME children may much &s;ooner be ad|mitted to the table of Chri&s;t than others. Do thou <HI>child</HI> de&s;ire to be among the fir&s;t; the mo&s;t ripe, the mo&s;t ready. Therefore learn diligently, and &s;eek to God earne&s;tly: get forward in Chri&s;t's School: be not the lea&s;t and la&s;t there: enter thy &s;elf betimes, and learn now in thy learning age.</P>
<P>A great part of the duty of bapti&s;ed chil|dren is to look forward to the Lord's table, and to keep their eye upon it; &s;aying often to them&s;elves, "I have been given up to Chri&s;t in bapti&s;m, and I mu&s;t be preparing to give my &s;elf up to him at his table.</P>
<P>AND a great part of the duty of parents lies in <HI>this,</HI> to in&s;till this con&s;ideration into the tender hearts of their children, &amp; &s;o bring
<PB N="22" REF="002854_0024_0FE678BA551CC900">them on to the recognition of their covenant engagements at the table of Chri&s;t. But not to do it lightly, cur&s;orily &amp; as a thing of form; but intelli ently, deliberately &amp; awful|ly: as <HI>David</HI> taught &amp; charg'd his &s;on, 1 Chron. 28.9. <HI>And thou Solomon my &s;on, know thou the God of thy father, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart &amp; with a willing mind; for the Lord &s;earch|eth all hearts, and under&s;tandeth all the imagina|tions of the thoughts: if thou &s;eek him he will be found of thee, but if thou for&s;ake him he will ca&s;t thee off for ever.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a point of great care, and calls for much concern and labour; and mo&s;t parents are great &s;trangers to this religious watch over their children: It is evident by their not com|ing them&s;elves to the table of Chri&s;t, and by the neglect of their hou&s;holds: and yet they know this to be the lea&s;t they owe unto Chri&s;t, to their own &s;ouls, and to the &s;ouls of their family.</P>
<P>BUT if this be the duty of <HI>parents,</HI> then <HI>children</HI> owe it as much unto Chri&s;t, unto their parents and to their own &s;ouls, to learn God's will betimes, to get knowledge &amp; under&s;tand|ing in the holy ways of God, and to live unto Him who made them, who al&s;o has bought and bound them to be his. And you, <HI>children,</HI> that are con&s;ecrated to God in <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> who are in&s;tructed in the word and law of God, and your obligations to him, by parents &amp; mini&s;ters; be you exhorted and warned to be <HI>early</HI> in your choice of God and of his ways.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002854_0025_0FE678BF9A7047B0">
AND now to clo&s;e all, <HI>Let parents and grown children be together exhorted, to be &s;ound together at the Lord's table.</HI> What is there more <HI>&s;it,</HI> and what could be more <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> than this? <HI>Parents,</HI> go your &s;elves to the Lord's pa&s;&s;over, as the parents of Chri&s;t did: And <HI>children</HI> come with your parents: or if they neglect them&s;elves come you before them; don't &s;tay for 'em. Or if they do not put you upon this duty as they &s;hould, remember that your Mini&s;ters put you in mind of it, and that you are now admoni&s;hed thereof.</P>
<P>MAY the <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> teach and incline you by his <HI>holy Spirit.</HI> May you be &s;uch as he was in his childhood and youth; &s;uch to God, &s;uch to your parents, and &s;uch to his church. That if you die young you may like <HI>Abel</HI> and <HI>Enoch</HI> be taken up to God: or if you live in the world you may be examples to others, fruitful Chri&s;tians, full of goodne&s;s, full of good works, to the honour of Chri&s;t, and the edification of others: Like good <HI>Obadiah,</HI> fear|ing the Lord from your youth; and like gra|cious <HI>Timothy,</HI> betimes knowing in the &s;crip|tures and wi&s;e to &s;alvation.</P>
<P>I will urge what has been &s;aid both to elder and younger per&s;ons, only with one <HI>motive.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WE are all dying and going to judgment, we know not which fir&s;t, whether the parent or the child.</HI> The <HI>graves</HI> are ready for us, and are not we ready, &s;hould we not be ready for the <HI>table of Chri&s;t?</HI> We are dropping into the

<P>PARENTS and children are both dying, and are alike concerned to be getting ready for a dying hour; let them take the <HI>table of Chri&s;t</HI> in their way, there to &s;et their &s;ouls <HI>in order</HI> for their going to him, and for their being <HI>found of their Judge in peace.</HI></P>
<P>LOOK into the <HI>Congregation of the dead</HI> and &s;ee how they ly <HI>mixt,</HI> here a parent and there his children; here an aged per&s;on, and there divers in their youth, and more in their child|hood: read the in&s;criptions on the grave-&s;tones and &s;ee how many under twenty and thirty to one above fifty or &s;ixty ly interr'd there; their &s;pirits gone to God that gave them, and into a mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed or mi&s;erable Eternity. And &s;hall it not be thus in the <HI>Con|gregation of the living</HI> and at the Lord's <HI>table?</HI> which has &s;o particular an a&s;pect on the &s;e|cond appearance of Chri&s;t, and on our prepa|ration for a &s;olemn appearance before Him, to give an account to him, and to hear our &s;en|tence from the mouth of the <HI>Lamb?</HI> Are not the <HI>funerals</HI> of every week, month and year &s;o mixt? parents following their children to the grave, <HI>the hou&s;e appointed for all the living,</HI> and children following their parents? and while they live together in this dying world, &s;hall they not <HI>come together into one place to eat the

<P>LET parents and children both con&s;ider, that their <HI>&s;ouls</HI> are alike precious, &amp; <HI>eternity</HI> is before them: that <HI>all &s;ouls are</HI> Chri&s;t's, <HI>the &s;oul of the Father and the &s;oul of the &s;on:</HI> that Chri&s;t has given his <HI>life</HI> a ran&s;om for both, has &s;hed his <HI>blood</HI> for both, and has extended his <HI>covenant</HI> unto both; commanding his mini&s;ters to <HI>feed</HI> both, <HI>his &s;heep and his lambs;</HI> that in the &s;pirit of <HI>Elias</HI> they &s;hould labour to <HI>turn the hearts of fathers and children</HI> together to him|&s;elf, <HI>to make ready a people prepared for the Lord; le&s;t he come and &s;mite the earth with a cur&s;e.</HI> See Mal. 4.6. and Luk. 1.17.</P>

And what care of the precious &s;ouls of an immortal <HI>off&s;pring?</HI> You expect to die before your children, and natu|rally de&s;ire to leave them behind you; or to
<PB N="26" REF="002854_0028_0FE6788FC1252EB0">be &s;ure you mu&s;t &s;oon follow 'em to the <HI>bar</HI> of God: But what account do you think of ren|dring to God of them?</P>
<P>WILL not the two fir&s;t enquiries put to thee by God the Father of Spirits be <HI>the&s;e,</HI> What care thou ha&s;t taken of thy <HI>own</HI> &s;oul, and what of the &s;ouls of the <HI>children</HI> which he has given thee? how then can you think of dying your &s;elves, or of your childrens dying, without being able to give an account with joy and not with grief?</P>
<P>AND you know not whether God will con|tinue <HI>you</HI> another week or day to yours, or <HI>them</HI> to you; what therefore <HI>your hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might,</HI> for there is no wi&s;dom or working in the grave whither thou art going. It may be you are <HI>cumbring</HI> your &s;elves about many things for yours that are to live after you, but <HI>one thing is needful,</HI> your own &s;oul and theirs: chu&s;e the <HI>good part</HI> that can never be taken from you, nor you from that. Remember the care of the good <HI>mother</HI> for her <HI>two</HI> &s;ons: Mat. 20.21. and dropping the in|firmity, let us improve her piety and imitate her wi&s;dom: <HI>Lord, that my two &s;ons may &s;it, the one on thy right hand and the other on thy left in thy kingdom.</HI> Had &s;he liv'd in our days her de&s;ire and care would have been to have &s;een them both, with her, at the <HI>Table</HI> of Chri&s;t, in the way to his <HI>Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>AND what &s;hould our <HI>Children</HI> now &s;ay un|to them&s;elves, or unto us, upon the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e? Should they not take up the <HI>an&s;wer</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="002854_0029_0FE6459AF648B698">of our Lord <HI>Ie&s;us</HI> (in our context) to his <HI>pa|rents,</HI> when they had &s;ought him &s;orrowing, and at la&s;t found him in the <HI>Temple,</HI> among the <HI>Doctors, Wi&s;t you not that I &s;hould be about my Fathers bu&s;ine&s;s?</HI> Yes, you &s;hould be early about the great bu&s;ine&s;s of your &s;ouls, <HI>the work|ing out your &s;alvation, the making your calling and election &s;ure.</HI> And therefore you mu&s;t be early in the <HI>temple</HI> of God, waiting daily at <HI>wi&s;doms' gates,</HI> and coming to the <HI>&s;pecial</HI> ordi|nances of the go&s;pel. And the <HI>younger</HI> you come, if it be intelligently and affectionately, with under&s;tanding and grace, in the fear of God and from love to him; you will be the more <HI>welcome</HI> and the more <HI>beloved</HI> of Chri&s;t: like <HI>Iohn</HI> the younge&s;t di&s;ciple, and <HI>him whom Ie&s;us loved,</HI> who leaned on his <HI>bo&s;ome</HI> at his la&s;t pa&s;&s;over &s;upper.</P>
<P><HI>AND now, Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are &s;anctified.</HI> That both parents and children may happily meet at the <HI>Table</HI> of Chri&s;t here, and in his <HI>Kingdom</HI> hereafter: That in the day of Chri&s;t, <HI>we</HI> may be able to &s;ay to Him, and <HI>He</HI> may &s;ay of us and ours unto his Father, <HI>Behold I and the children which thou ha&s;t given me.</HI></P>
