<HEAD>A REVIEW OF THE MILITARY OPERATIONS IN <HI>NORTH AMERICA,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I ESTEEM my&s;elf highly honoured,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduc|tion.</NOTE> when you reque&s;t of me, a full account of the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and pre&s;ent &s;tate, of the military operations in North America; with a ju&s;t delineation of the characters of the principal agents in our political affairs. Indeed, my Lord, you impo&s;e a ta&s;k that will require a Volume, rather than a Letter. As your Lord&s;hip's de&s;ire, however, &s;hall always carry with me the force of a com|mand, I will engage in it with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s. Forgive me, my Lord, for &s;aying I have a &s;till &s;tronger motive for com|po&s;ing the&s;e &s;heets, than a mere compliance with your Lord&s;hip's reque&s;t; to which I would ever pay the profounde&s;t regard. When I reflect upon your eminent &s;tation&mdash;your excelling abi|lities&mdash;your warm and active zeal, for the intere&s;t and welfare of the Briti&s;h colonies; I am prompted by an unfeigned de&s;ire of &s;erving my country; and &s;etting before your Lord&s;hip's eyes TRUTH, in her plain undi&s;gui&s;ed habiliments: I would &s;trip
<PB N="6" REF="008163_0004_102E409C58571440">her of all that delu&s;ive colouring, with which &s;he hath been art|fully varni&s;hed, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">-writers from this part of the world; either to &s;ub&s;erve &s;ome mean &s;ini&s;ter party de&s;ign, or to promote the views of &s;ome a&s;piring and ambitions minds. Candour and integrity &s;hall therefore guide my pen; and amid&s;t the variety with which it is my purpo&s;e to pre&s;ent your Lord&s;hip, it &s;hall be my &s;acred endeavour, to the be&s;t of my knowledge, to attach my&s;elf to the &s;tricte&s;t &mdash; the mo&s;t impartial verity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">American colanies too long neglected tho' of ge|neral im|portance.</NOTE> THE American colonies, I &s;peak it with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, my Lord, were too long neglected by their mother country; tho' loudly demanding her patronage and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Tho&s;e, on the conti|nent, require her peculiar notice: They may be made an inex|hau&s;tible magazine of wealth; and if &s;uffered to fall into the hands of the French, &s;uch will be the acce&s;&s;ion to their already extended commerce and marine &s;trength, that Great Britain mu&s;t not only lo&s;e her former lu&s;tre, but, dreadful even in thought! cea&s;e to be any longer an independent power. Nay, &s;hould every other &s;cheme fail, the &s;ucce&s;s of this will inevitably accompli&s;h the long|projected de&s;ign of that a&s;piring nation, for &s;etting up an Uni|ver&s;al Monarchy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for, if France rule the ocean, her re&s;ources will enable her to &s;ubject all Europe to her de&s;potic &s;way. But it is unnece&s;&s;ary to offer any arguments in &s;upport of a propo&s;i|tion, of which the Public &s;eems to remain no longer in&s;en&s;ible. Happy for us, had the&s;e &s;entiments prevailed earlier, and been more frequently inculcated!</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">More con|&s;idered, on the reduc|tion of Louisburg.</NOTE> THE importance of the colonies, my Lord, was too little con|&s;idered, till the commencement of the la&s;t war. The reduction of Cape Breton by the people of New-England, was an acqui&s;ition &s;o unexpected and fortunate, that America became, on that re|markable event, a more general topic of conver&s;ation. Mr. Shir|ley, the governor of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, was the principal projector of that glorious enterprize: An enterprize, which re|duced to the obedience of his Britannick Maje&s;ty, the DUNKIRK of North America. Of &s;uch con&s;equence to the French, was the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that important key to their American &s;ettlements, that its re&s;titution was, in reality, the purcha&s;e of the la&s;t general Peace in Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Gov. Shirley.</NOTE> OF all our plantation Governors, my Lord, Mr. Shirley is mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for his &s;ingular abilities. He was born in Eng|land,
<PB N="7" REF="008163_0005_102E40D2F5EF28D0">and bred up to the Law, at one of the Inns of Court. In that profe&s;&s;ion he afterwards practi&s;ed, for &s;everal years, in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay: and, in 1741, was advanced by his Ma|je&s;ty to the &s;upreme command of that colony. He is a Gen|tleman of great political &s;agacity, deep penetration, and indefati|gable indu&s;try. With re&s;pect to the wi&s;dom and equity of his admini&s;tration, he can boa&s;t the univer&s;al &s;uffrage of a wi&s;e, free, jealous, and moral people. Tho' not bred to arms, he is emi|nently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e important military virtues &mdash; An ex|tent of capacity to form and execute great de&s;igns; &mdash; pro|found &s;ecre&s;y; &mdash; love of regularity and di&s;cipline; &mdash; a fru|gal and laborious manner of living; with the art of conciliating the affections; &mdash; a talent which Hannibal admired in Pyrrhus, above all the re&s;t of his martial accompli&s;hments. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e great qualities, Mr. Shirley is univer&s;ally acknowledged to &s;hine: and it is, in reality, more e&s;timable, than all other military endowments without it; con&s;i&s;ting, to u&s;e the words of that di&s;cerning hi&s;torian Mr. Rollin, <Q><HI>in having great views; in forming plans at a di&s;tance; in propo&s;ing a de&s;ign, from which the author never departs; in concerting all the mea|&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;ucce&s;s; in knowing how to &s;eize the favourable moments of occa&s;ion, which are rapid in their cour&s;e, and never return; to make even &s;udden and unfore&s;een accidents &s;ub&s;ervient to a plan; in a word, to be upon the watch again&s;t every thing, without being perplexed and di&s;|concerted by any event.</HI></Q> But, whether it ari&s;es from his being &s;o far advanced in years, or from his con&s;titutional di&s;|po&s;ition and make, he has not, in my opinion, that activity and alertne&s;s &s;o conducive to warlike expedition; and on which the &s;ucce&s;s of an enterprize frequently depends. This was one of the characteri&s;tics of Braddock; a commander, vigorous in executing, as Mr. Shirly, judicious in contriving a plan&mdash; <HI>&s;ed non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia po&s;&s;umus-ownes</HI> &mdash; and 'tis ea&s;ier, my Lord, to find active hands, than able heads.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hisatten|tion to co|lony af|fairs.</NOTE> No man perhaps in the nation, has be&s;towed more attention, upon the &s;tate of the co|lonies in general: and having their intere&s;t &s;incerely at heart, he has been perpetually concerting expedients, advancive of their pro&s;perity, and to check the views of an all-gra&s;ping Mo|narch. Upon the reduction of Loui&s;burgh, he earne&s;tly recom|mended to his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ter, the demolition of that for|tre&s;s,
<PB N="8" REF="008163_0006_102E409EE148C080">and an expedition again&s;t the French &s;ettlements in Ca|nada. The rea&s;ons why he &s;ucceeded in neither of the&s;e pro|po&s;als,

His Maje&s;ty, how|ever, &s;en&s;ible of his &s;ervices, gave him a regiment in 1746; and upon the conclu&s;ion of the peace of Aix-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a-Chapelle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt him as one of the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;aries to Paris, for &s;ettling the controverted limits between the two Crowns in America. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mid&s;t all the &s;pendors and delicacies of Ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arllies, he forgot neither OUR intere&s;t, nor HIS duty. As a proof of his inte|grity and diligence, during that fruitle&s;s emba&s;&s;y, one need only peru&s;e the&s;e judicious and laborious memorials, in &s;upport of his Maje&s;ty's right to Nova Scotia which were principally framed by him; and lately publi&s;hed by order of the Lords of Trade, as a full exhibit of our title to that part of A|merica. When no &s;atisfaction could, in this way, be obtained from the Court of France; which was artfully endeavouring to &s;pin out the negotiation, and at the &s;ame time fortifying the places in que&s;tion, as well as making new acqui&s;itions; the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;aries retired from the French Court, and Mr. Shirley re&s;umed his government in New-England in Au|gu&s;t 1753.</P>

<P><HI>As I have the honour to command here in chief, Mr. Wa&s;hington delivered me the letter, which you directed to the commandant of the French troops. I &s;hould have been plea&s;ed if you had given him orders, or if he him&s;elf had been di&s;po&s;ed, to vi&s;it Canada and our general; to whom, rather than to me, it properly appertains to demon&s;trate the reality of the King my ma&s;ter's rights to lands &s;ituated along the Ohio, and to di&s;pute the preter&s;ions of the King of Great Britain in that re&s;pect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall immediately forward your letter to Mon&s;. Le Marquis Du Que&s;ne. His an&s;wer will be a law to me: and if he directs me to communicate it to you, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, I &s;hall neglect nothing that ma be nece&s;&s;ary to convey it to you with expedition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the requi&s;ition you make (that I retire with the troops under my command) I cannot believe my&s;elf under any obligation to &s;ubmit to it.

<P><HI>I do not know that, in the cour&s;e of this campaign, any thing has pa&s;&s;ed that can be e&s;teemed an act of ho&s;tility, or contrary to the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two Crowns; the continuation of which is as intere&s;ting and plea&s;ing to us, as it can be to the Engli&s;h.

He wrote al&s;o to the neighbouring governors, importuning the aid of the other colonie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for repelling the inva&s;ion, and erecting a &s;ort at the confluence of the Ohio and Monongahela. An immediate junction in &s;uch mea&s;ures became ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for our common &s;ecurity. But the colonies, alas! were &s;unk into a profound lethergy; and, re&s;igned to &s;tupidity and &s;lumbering, appeared in&s;en&s;ible of the threatning danger. They contemned the power of Canada; confided in the number of their inhabitants; inattentive were they to the inconveniencies of an endle&s;s frontier; and in &s;hort intirely unacquainted with the &s;ituation of the inland country. The waters of the Ohio, before this period, were &s;carce known, &s;ave to a few Indian traders; and the generality deemed tho&s;e French &s;ettlements too remote to be the object of dread, and a matter of in&s;ignificant moment.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Clinton arrived as Governor, 22 Sept. 1743.</NOTE>, Mr. De Lancey was pre&s;ented with a fre&s;h opportunity for the exhibition of his political genius. Mr. Clinton, a gentleman of but indifferent parts, wholly re|&s;igned him&s;elf into his hands. Contenting him&s;elf with the title and &s;alary of Governor, he left the &s;ole direction of af|fairs to his mini&s;ter, who by virtue of his late acquired om|nipotence with the a&s;&s;embly, carried all his points, and even endeared him to the people. This intimacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ted no longer than it was found conducive to his de&s;igns. Having obtain|ed from Mr. Clinton a new commi&s;&s;ion for his office of Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>during good behaviour;</HI> and flattering him&s;elf with the hopes of another, appointing him Lieut. Governor, through the intere&s;t of his friends in England, he cared not how &s;oon his excellency abdicated the province, nor how tempe&s;tuous he rendered his admini&s;tration; and was therefore prepared for an open rupture. He no &s;ooner thought him&s;elf capable of acting independently of the governor, than like Sixtus Quin|tus, who threw a&s;ide his cruthes the moment of his exalta|tion to the popedom, he put off all that humble devotion, by which he had &s;o fatally deceived his too credulous ma&s;ter, and openly &s;et him&s;elf at defiance again&s;t him. Now he began to dictate, rather than advi&s;e: and in&s;tead of Sejanus, cho&s;e to be Tiberius him&s;elf. Dining one day with Mr. Clinton, and in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;ome favourite point with great imperiou&s;|ne&s;s,
<PB N="18" REF="008163_0016_102E40AAD920F3F0">the Governor, who had hitherto very cordially &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led, refu&s;ed on this occa&s;ion to be driven. The Chief Ju&s;tice then aro&s;e and left him; declaring, with an oath, he would make his admini&s;tration unea&s;y for the future: His Excellency replied, he might do his wor&s;t. Thus they parted; nor were ever afterwards reconciled. This breach gave ri&s;e to the contentions, which &s;o unhappily imbroiled our pro|vincial affairs, during the remainder of his admini&s;tration. The a&s;&s;embly were in&s;tantly inflamed. He who before had been able to make them connive at very unju&s;tifiable &s;teps, could at once &s;tir up an oppo&s;ition to the mo&s;t unexceptionable mea|&s;ures. Remon&s;trances, warm and virulent, were now drawn up; unworthy their own dignity to offer, and replete with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t language to his Maje&s;ty's repre&s;entative. Thus was formed again&s;t Mr. Clinton a powerful party, which cea&s;ed not, while he continued at the helm, to harra&s;s and perplex him. To &s;uch an exorbitant length did they carry their op|po&s;ition, as to throw off the re&s;traint of humanity: They had even recour&s;e to force and violence. Nay, a parti&s;an of the Chief Ju&s;tice, in defiance of the &s;acred rights of the magi&s;tra|cy and the law &mdash; to &s;hew his re&s;entment again&s;t Mr. Clin|ton and his adherents &mdash; a&s;&s;aulted the mayor; whipped the &s;heriff; damned the Governor; and &s;tabbed his phy&s;ician. My Lord, we became the &s;port and contempt of our neighbours; and it is beyond contradiction, that Mr. De Lancey, by blow|ing up the coals of contention, did the province more injury, than he will be ever able to repair. Nor is their any rea&s;on to doubt, that the enorm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us power of this gentleman, and the ferment rai&s;ed again&s;t Mr. Clinton, occa&s;ioned the 39th arti|cle of the king's in&s;tructions to Sir Danvers O&s;born; which appears purpo&s;ely calculated to render our future Governors independent on his influence over the a&s;&s;embly: For a law indefinite, making provi&s;ion for the &s;alary allowed by the King to his Governors; and competent &s;alaries to all judges, ju&s;tices, and other nece&s;&s;ary officers and mini&s;ters of government &mdash; &s;uch a law, I &s;ay, would effectually render a Governor inde|pendent of the a&s;&s;embly, and con&s;equently of any undue in|fluence in it.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Mr. Tho+mas Pow|nal.</NOTE> brother to John Pownal, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the &s;ecretaries to the Board of Trade, was upon the &s;pot. This gentleman came over to America with Sir Danvers O&s;born, in quality of his private &s;ecretary; though it was imagined by many, he was de&s;igned to be an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to him in the exerci&s;e of the go|vernment. He is &s;omething of a &s;cholar, but a confu&s;ed rea|&s;oner; and in his &s;tile perplexed; and in that u&s;efulle&s;t of all &s;ciences, the knowledge of mankind, he is a mere novitiate: without the latter, your Lord&s;hip knows that other acquire|ments are comparatively of &s;mall account, in the management of public bu&s;ine&s;s. To be only learned, is frequently to be vain, o&s;tentatious, and ob&s;tinate; &s;uch a one, in a word, as Tertullian de&s;cribes the mo&s;t learned among the heathens, "an animal of glory." This gentleman is fond of being con&s;i|dered <HI>in an important light.</HI> In&s;atiable of prai&s;e, he can not only hear him&s;elf flattered; but, what is more unaccountable in a man of tolerable &s;en&s;e, can flatter him&s;elf. He is a per&s;on of uncommon application, and a good memory. By dint of indu&s;try, and an acce&s;s to the papers in the Plantation Board Office, he has acquired &s;ome knowledge of American affairs: but &s;o keen is his appetite for promotion, that he cannot brook the thoughts of a gradual advancement. He is for galloping into preferment: and &s;o intent on the contemplation of his future grandeur, as to lo&s;e all patience in earning it. Being more &s;killed in books than men, he is very abrupt in giving a &s;chola&s;tic turn to conver&s;ation, in order to di&s;play his erudition. Ever ready to contradict: him&s;elf impatient of contradiction. But wonderful is his knack at pluming him&s;elf with the &s;chemes and inventions of others; and, with the daw in the fable, &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng in a borrowed dre&s;s: a remarkable in&s;tance of which I &s;hall give your Lord&s;hip in the following anecdote; as

This he delivered to &s;ome of the mem|bers of the congre&s;s to be communicated: and afterwards tran&s;|mitted a copy to England; challenging to him&s;elf the &s;ole merit of being the original author of &s;o u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary an expedient

<P>On the welcome intelligence of the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e repre|&s;entations; and while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were expecting from England; the two regiments or Shirley and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were ordered to be ree&s;tabli&s;hed, and recru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were rai&s;ing thro' the &s;everal go|vernments, to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rm an army for di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the French from their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate encroachments.</P>
<P>THE general a&s;&s;embly of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay being con|vened,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;igns an expediti|on again&s;t Crown Point.</NOTE> and the members &s;worn to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">crecy; Mr. Shirley com|municated to them a de&s;ign of attacking Fort St. Frederic at Crown Point, the en&s;uing &s;pring; and his intention to appoint Col. John&s;on to the command of that expedition. The &s;cheme being approved by the council and repre&s;entatives of that pro|vince, and the quotas &s;ettled, commi&s;&s;ioners were charged to the neighbouring governments, to &s;ollicit their concurrence and aid, in the pro&s;ecution of this enterprize.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e matters were in agitation. Mr. Pownal was at Bo&s;ton, intending to &s;ail from thence to England. He now thought fit to change his re&s;olution; and Governor Shirley ho|noured him with the emba&s;&s;y to New York, for which place he &s;et out the beginning of March. Some gentlemen of the council and a&s;&s;embly were commi&s;&s;ioned, on the like errand, to the other colonies of New Jer&s;ey, Pen&s;ylvania, &amp;c.</P>
<P>MR. POWNAL's pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s at New-York were at fir&s;t not very encouraging.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lancey endea|vours to ob&s;truct the con|currence of New York.</NOTE> De Lancey, jealous of Shirley's ri&s;ing reputation, appeared, with regard to the expedition recommend|ed, extremely phlegmatic: and tho' artful enough to ab&s;tain from an open oppo&s;ition, he made u&s;e of Mr. Chambers as his tool in council, to ob&s;truct the concurrence of the legi&s;lature. At this time great animo&s;ities were prevailing in the province, occa&s;ioned by a charter ju&s;t before granted by Mr. De Lan|cey, con&s;tituting a college for the education of youth, upon a foundation which happened to enkindle the general di&s;gu&s;t. The majority of the hou&s;e, apprehending the lo&s;s of their &s;eats on a future election, &s;hould they afford it the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="28" REF="008163_0026_102E40B68802F2F8">found them&s;elves obliged rather to countenance the popular re|&s;entment. A gentleman of di&s;tinction, with whom Mr. Pownal advi&s;ed on the &s;ubject of his commi&s;&s;ion, thought it a pru|dent &s;tep to open his me&s;&s;age in part, to tho&s;e members of the a&s;&s;embly, who, on the above-mentioned account, were then in the oppo&s;ition. Several of the leading men were &s;ecured by this method:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">But in vain.</NOTE> and when the hou&s;e met, &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition appeared to join in the &s;cheme propo&s;ed, that it was beyond Mr. De Lancey's power to ob&s;truct it. Out of pique howe|ver to Mr. Shirley, to whom this expedition was &s;olely com|mitted, he prevailed upon them to &s;u&s;pend the execution of their vote, until General Braddock's approbation was obtained: and by this artifice occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable delay in the ope|rations.</P>
<P>GENERAL BRADDOCK,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Braddock convenes the go|vernors, and &s;ettles the opera|tions.</NOTE> being now arrived in Virginia, &s;ent expre&s;&s;es to the &s;everal governors to meet him, in order to a con&s;ultation on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the approaching campaign.&mdash; This convention was opened on the 14th of April
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was at fir&s;t propo&s;ed to have been held at Annapolis in Mary|land. Mr. Shirley, who thro' the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of his affairs did not arrive there till April, has been charged with delaying Braddock's march near three weeks; tho' it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us, <HI>that</HI> delay was occa|&s;ioned by the failure of the Virginia contract for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;up|plies.

Here it appeared, that thro' mi&s;repre|&s;entations from Virginia, the general was inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined to proceed im|mediately to Fort Du Que&s;ne. Tho&s;e who were well acquainted with the country, could not help ob&s;erving, that a march from Potowmac, acro&s;s the Allegheny mountains, mu&s;t be attended with incredible difficulty, hazard, and expence &mdash; that the vi|cinity of New York to Canada &mdash; its fort of O&s;wego on Lake Ontario &mdash; together with the advantages of water carriage &mdash; rendered that province by far the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> theatre of action. Brad|dock's orders were neverthele&s;s po&s;itive. &mdash; For the pre&s;erva|tion therefore of O&s;wego, and the reduction of Niagara, it was at length agreed, that Shirley's and Pepperel's regiments &s;hould

<P>THESE re&s;olutions being taken,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley returns to Bo&s;ton, to prepare for the Northern Expediti|ons.</NOTE> Mr. Shirley began his journey to Bo&s;ton, to prepare for the expedition under his immediate command; to forward that under Col. John&s;on; and to quicken the departure of the New England troops, now a&s;&s;embled by his Maje&s;ty's directions, for reducing the French &s;ettlements in Nova Scotia. On his way, he &s;pent &s;ome time in conference with Col. Schuyler, a gentleman of fortune and courage, who, out of di&s;intere&s;ted love to his country, was engaged to head a regiment of 500 men, rai&s;ed and maintained by the province of New Jer&s;ey. In New York, he was retarded a few days to con&s;ult with General John&s;on, and remove &s;ome objections made by Mr. De Lancey to the form of his commi&s;&s;ion:
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr John&s;on had his commi&s;&s;ion from the governors of the provinces, which furni&s;hed the troops under his command; the draft of which was &s;ettled at Alexandria. The Lieut Governor of New York now thought proper to repeat tho&s;e very objections, which had been there over-ruled. This unaccountable conduct gave Mr. John&s;on great un|ea&s;ine&s;s, who could not obtain Mr. De Lancey's commi&s;&s;ion, till pro|per notice was taken by General Shirley of &s;o manife&s;t an ob&s;truction to the operations of the campaign.</NOTE> and in Connecticut, to ha&s;ten the a&s;&s;embling the troops of that colony
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Connecticut had voted one thou&s;and men for the Crown Point expe|dition and given a&s;&s;urances of 500 more, if the &s;ervice &s;o required. New York was to &s;upply 800; but thro' the delay occa&s;ioned by the &s;u&s;pending clau&s;e above men &s;oned in the vote of our a&s;&s;embly, Mr. De Lancey's brother was &s;ent into Connecticut, to obtain leave for recruiting the quota we were to furni&s;h, in that colony; as men might there be rai&s;ed more &s;peedily than in the province of New York. Mr, Shirley being at Hartford, during this application, was told h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Governor Fitch, that if Connecticut complied, they &s;hould con&s;ider them&s;elves di&s;engaged from the a&s;&s;urances given of 500 more than their own quota, did the &s;ervice demand it. This, with Mr. Oliver De Lancey's declaration &mdash; that if him&s;elf &s;hould accept the command of the New York regiment, he could in ten days rai&s;e the whole number in this province, induced Mr Shirley to oppo&s;e the ap|plication; it appearing to him not improbable, that the &s;ervice might afterwards require the reinforcement offered.

THE nece&s;&s;ary di&s;patches being given to the expedition to Nova Scotia under Col. Win&s;low, Mr. Shirley, upon the arri|val of the payma&s;ter for the northern di&s;trict, returned to New York;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And &s;ails for Alba|ny.</NOTE> and on the 4th of July &s;ailed for Albany, his own Regiment having pa&s;&s;ed by for that place, in twenty-one tran|&s;ports, a few days before.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nova Scotia re|duced.</NOTE> the colonies were filled with univer&s;al joy, on the agreeable news that the New England troops were be|come ma&s;ters of Beau-&s;ejour and Bay Verte, on the i&s;thmus of Nova Scotia; whereby a new province was added to the Briti&s;h empire in America: and that a &s;trong fleet, under Admiral Bo&s;cawen, lay before Loui&s;burgh, to intercept the French &s;upplies; and which had al&s;o &s;eized two of their capital &s;hips, the Lys and Alcide, and &s;ent them into Halifax.</P>
<P>GENERAL BRADDOCK was now on his march towards the Ohio,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Braddock marches from Fort Cumber|land</NOTE> at the head of about 2200 men, in order to inve&s;t Fort Du Que&s;ne, and drive the French from their encroachments on the frontiers of Virginia and Pen&s;ylvania. From Fort Cumber|land to Fort Du Que&s;ne, the di&s;tance is not le&s;s than 130 miles. Mr. Braddock began his march from the former on the 10th of June; leaving the garri&s;on under the command of Col. Innes. Innumerable were the difficulties he had to &s;urmount, in a country rugged, pathle&s;s, and unknown, acro&s;s the Allegheny mountains, thro' unfrequented woods, and dangerous defiles. From the little meadows the army proceeded in two divi&s;ions. At the head of the fir&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of 1400 men, was the ge|neral him&s;elf, with the greate&s;t part of the ammunition and ar|tillery. The &s;econd, with the provi&s;ions, &s;tores, and heavy bag|gage, was led by Col. Dunbar. Never was man more confi|dent of &s;ucce&s;s, than this brave, tho' unfortunate officer. Be|ing advi&s;ed at the great meadows, that the enemy expected a reinforcement of 500 regular troops, he pu&s;hed on by forced
<PB N="31" REF="008163_0029_102E40F36F354BF0">marches, with &s;o much di&s;patch, that he fatigued the &s;oldiers, weakened his hor&s;es, and le&s;t his &s;econd divi&s;ion near 40 miles in the rear. The enemy being not more than 200 &s;trong at their fort on the Ohio, gave no ob&s;truction to the much of our forces, till the memorable 9th of July &mdash; a day never to be forgotten in the Annals of North America. About noon our troops pa&s;&s;ed the Monagahela, and were then within &s;even miles of Fort Du Que&s;ne. &mdash; Unapprehen&s;ive of the approach of an enemy, at once was the alarm given, by a quick and heavy fire upon the vanguard, under Lieut. Col. Gage. Im|mediately the main body, in good order and high &s;pirits, ad|vanced to &s;u&s;tain them. Orders were then given to halt, and form into battalia. At this juncture the van falling back upon them, in great confu&s;ion, a general panic &s;eized the whole body of the &s;oldiery; and all attempts to rally them proved ut|terly ineffectual. The general and all the officers exerted their utmo&s;t activity, to recover them from the univer&s;al &s;urprize and di&s;order: but equally deaf were they to intreaties and com|mands. During this &s;cene of confu&s;ion, they expended their ammunition in the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t unmeaning fire. Some di&s;charging their pieces on our own parties, who were advanced from the main body for the recovery of the cannon. After three hours &s;pent in this melancholy &s;ituation, enduring a terrible &s;laughter, from (it may be &s;aid) an <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> foe, orders were given to found a retreat, that the men might be brought to cover the waggons. The&s;e they &s;urrounded but a &s;hort &s;pace of time: for the enemy's fire being again warmly renewed from the front and left flank, the whole army took to imme|diate flight; leaving behind them all the artillery, provi&s;ions, ammunition, baggage, military che&s;t, together with the general's cabinet, containing his in&s;tructions and other papers of con&s;e|quence. So great was the con&s;ternation of the &s;oldiers, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;top their career, flying with the utmo&s;t precipitation three miles from the field of action; where only one hundred began to make a more orderly retreat.</P>
<P>WHAT was the &s;trength of the enemy, has hitherto remained to us uncertain. According to Indian accounts, they exceeded not 400, chiefly Indians: and whither any were &s;lain, is &s;till to be doubted, for few were &s;een by our men, being covered
<PB N="32" REF="008163_0030_102E40BDD1964DD8">by &s;tumps and fallen trees. Great indeed was the de&s;truction on our &s;ide. &mdash; Numbers of officers &s;acrificed their lives thro' &s;ingular bravery. Extremely unfortunate was the whole &s;taff. The general, after having five hor&s;es &s;hot under him received a wound in his lungs thro' his right arm, of which he died in four days. His Secretary, elde&s;t &s;on of Major General Shirley, a gentleman of great accompli&s;hments, by a &s;hot thro' the head, was killed upon the &s;pot. Mr. Orme and Capt. Morris, aid-de-camps, were all wounded. Of the 44th regi|ment, Sir Peter Halket, Colonel, was &s;lain, with &s;everal other officers; and Lieut. Col. Gage wounded. Lieut. Col. Burton, of the 48th regiment, was among the wounded; and many gallant officers peri&s;hed in the field. Our whole lo&s;s was about &s;even hundred killed and wounded.</P>
<P>To what cau&s;es this unhappy cata&s;trophe is to be a&s;cribed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">To what cau&s;es the defeat was a&s;cribed</NOTE> has been matter of much inquiry and animated debate. The officers charged the defeat to the cowardice of the men: but, in a repre&s;entation they made to Mr. Shirley, by order of the Crown, they in &s;ome mea&s;ure apologize for their behaviour&mdash; alledging, that they were harra&s;&s;ed by duties unequal to their numbers, and di&s;pirited thro' want of provi&s;ions: That time was not allowed them to dre&s;s their food: That their water (the only liquor too they had) was both &s;carce and of a bad quality: In fine, that the provincials had di&s;heartned them, by repeated &s;ugge&s;tions of their fears of a defeat, &s;hould they be attacked by Indians; in which ca&s;e the European method of fighting would be intirely unavailing. But, my Lord, however cen&s;urable the conduct of the &s;oldiery may be thought, Mr. Braddock, too &s;anguine in his pro&s;pects, was generally blamed for neglecting to cultivate the friend&s;hip of the Indians, who offered their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and who, it is certain, had a number of them preceded the army, would have &s;ea&s;onably di&s;covered the enemy's ambu&s;cade. The Virginian rangers al&s;o, in&s;tead of being made to &s;erve as regulars is the ranks with the Engli&s;h troops, &s;hould have been employed as out &s;couts. But this &s;tep, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t &s;urprize, was too unhappily omitted; the whole army, according to the repre&s;entation above mentioned, following only <HI>three or four guides.</HI></P>

<P>ALBANY, my Lord, was the grand theatre of all the prepa|rations for the northern expedition again&s;t Fort St. Frederick, as well as that to the we&s;tward for the reduction of Niagara. The general, on his arrival there, found not the former in the forwardne&s;s he had rea&s;on to expect. The provincials di&s;con|tended with the inactivity of a long encampment, Major Gene|ral Lyman was obliged to make &s;hort marches, to prevent their di&s;banding;

<P>OSWEGO, along the accu&s;tomed route,

In the la&s;t &s;ummer months, when rains are not fre|quent, it is u&s;ually &s;ix or eight miles acro&s;s. Taking water again, we enter a narrow rivulet, called the Wood-creek, which leads into the Oneida Lake, di&s;tance forty miles. This &s;tream, tho' favourable, being &s;hallow, and its banks covered with thick woods, was at this time much ob&s;tructed with old logs and fallen trees. The Oneida Lake &s;tretches from ea&s;t to we&s;t about thirty miles, and in calm weather is pa&s;&s;ed with great facility. At its we&s;tern extremity opens the Onondaga River, leading down to O&s;wego, &s;ituated at its entrance on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Lake Ontario. Extremely difficult and hazardous is the pa&s;|&s;age thro' this river, as it abounds with rifts and rocks; and the current flowing with &s;urprizing rapidity. The principal ob|&s;truction is twelve miles &s;hort of O&s;wego, and is a fall of a|bout eleven feet perpendicular. The portage here is by land, not exceeding forty yards, before they launch for the la&s;t time.</P>
<P>YOUR LORDSHIP, from this account, will readily conceive, that thro' &s;uch a long amphibious march an army mu&s;t pro|ceed with prodigious ri&s;que and fatigue; and the battoes be nece&s;&s;arily conducted by per&s;ons &s;killed in the navigation, and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ured to hard&s;hips.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anecdote of John+&s;on and Shirley.</NOTE> Mr. John&s;on laid before him a copy of the minutes of his late treaty with the Indians. The&s;e minutes, it &s;eems, contained &s;ome unhand&s;ome reflections upon his excellency; in&s;inuating, that to treat &s;eperately with them, he had employed one Lydius, a per&s;on of not the mo&s;t unex|ceptionable character, either for loyalty or integrity. The &s;ingle rea&s;on upon which the &s;urmi&s;e could be founded was this. Ly|dius, who formerly lived near Lake George, and who&s;e Indian acquaintance was very exten&s;ive, had offered the general his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, in procuring the junction of a number of them, on the de&s;igned expeditions. Upon which he wrote to Mr. John|&s;on, intimating the plea&s;ure it would give him, if he could make any u&s;e of this man in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. On delivering tho&s;e minutes into the general's hands, John&s;on, &s;en&s;ible of the in&s;inuation, told him, he intirely di&s;approved the reflection they &s;eemed to contain, and appeared a&s;hamed of its in&s;ertion. Hav|ing peru&s;ed the paper, Shirley could not avoid complaining of the ill u&s;age; while the other with &s;olemn vows prote&s;ted, he was not privy to it, and importuned him to return the minutes, that he might era&s;e the obnoxious pa&s;&s;age. The former confi|ded in the &s;incerity of his prote&s;tations, but &s;oon after had a|bundant rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t his integrity.</P>
<P>THE general had applied to one Staats, who re&s;ided near Al|bany, and had a con&s;iderable intere&s;t with the Indians of Stock|bridge

YOUR LORDSHIP, being already informed of this gentleman's appointment to the command of the provincial army, by the intere&s;t of General Shirley, will &s;carce have patience at the re|cital of a conduct &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing and ungrateful. The &s;ecret, my Lord, was this &mdash;Mr. John&s;on was never di&s;tingui&s;hed for his &s;en&s;e or penetration.

Wraxal, a man of art and genius, who a few years before had been appointed &s;ecretary for Indian affairs, and clerk of the city and county of Albany. Governor Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ton had granted a com|mi&s;&s;ion for the latter of tho&s;e offices, before the date of Wraxal's &s;ign manual. A &s;uit was therefore commenced, and is &s;till de|pending between him, and the per&s;on in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the office, &s;u&s;pended on the determination of a point of law. Upon this account Wraxal became a humble dependant on Lieut. Gover|nor De Lancey, before whom, unle&s;s &s;uper&s;eded in the chief com|mand, the ca&s;e mu&s;t be determined upon a writ of error: The latter, who had been a declared enemy to John&s;on, throughout the whole of Clinton's admini&s;tration, and had even prevented the a&s;&s;embly from di&s;charging a very equitable demand he had again&s;t the province for &s;ervices and di&s;bur&s;ements, now deter|mined to fall in with, and &s;et him up, in competition with Shir|ley. Wraxal's po&s;t and dependance afforded a fine opportunity for the purpo&s;e: and &s;o John&s;on became &s;trongly attached to the Lieut. Governor. Your Lord&s;hip will no longer wonder at his procuring all the Indians he could prevail upon,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Evil effects<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of 11.</NOTE> to join the provincial troops under his own command; or at his at|tempts to excite others to embarra&s;s and ob&s;truct the general's de&s;igns upon the Lake Ontario. In &s;upport of a charge &s;o heavy as this, I think it incumbent upon me to a&s;&s;ign the following in&s;tances: 1. Not an Indian joined General Shirley at Schenecta|dy, agreeably to Mr. John&s;on's po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances. 2. Nor at either of the ca&s;tles in the five cantons, as he pa&s;&s;ed thro' them to O&s;wego: but, on the contrary; 3. One Bant, an Onondaga (three of who&s;e &s;ons were in John&s;on's army) at the head of &s;everal other In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ians, declared to Mr. Shirley at O&s;wego, that it was a place of trade and peace &mdash; that there &s;hould be no war there &mdash; and that he &s;hould not di&s;turb the French; ad|ding that he was going with the like me&s;&s;age to Canada. The general having convinced him, that the expul&s;ion of the French from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> encroachments mu&s;t redound to the advantage of the
<PB N="38" REF="008163_0036_102E40C26A78AE40">Six Nations; he a&s;&s;erted, that Mr. John&s;on had &s;ent them upon this emba&s;&s;y to Canada. Tho' this appeared utterly incredible, 'tis neverthele&s;s certain, 4. &s;everal other Indians arrived from the Onondaga ca&s;tle, with a belt, declaring it to have been &s;ent them by Mr. John&s;on, with his reque&s;t, that not a man of them would join the King's troops, under the command of General Shirley. 5. Others al&s;o, from the Seneca, Oneida, and Cayuga cantons concurred in the like reports; particularly one Redhead, an In|dian of great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, and a &s;peaker at the late congre&s;s at Mount-John&s;on, came to O&s;wego, in his way to O&s;wagatic or la Gall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tte, and de&s;ired the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ation of all military de&s;igns; affirming, that with the &s;ame reque&s;t he was going to the French.</P>
<P>IT was with difficulty, my Lord, the&s;e Indians were reconci|led to our attempts, detained at O&s;wego, and thereby prevented from communicating our operations to the enemy. The general, from the&s;e in&s;tances, became more and more &s;u&s;picious, that the faction at New York were endeavouring to embarra&s;s and im|pede his mea&s;ures. What farther confirmed his &s;u&s;picions, that the Lieut. Governor of New York, with that view, made Mr John|&s;on his in&s;trument, was a letter, which after his arrival at O&s;wego he received from the latter wherein he ju&s;tified that very a&s;per&s;ion before di&s;avowed, contained in the minutes above recounted.</P>

<P>AFTER what I have already recounted,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His influ|ence over the a&s;&s;em|bly.</NOTE> your Lord&s;hip will not, I pre&s;ume, be at all &s;urprized, to find Mr. De Lancey leaving no device untried, to maintain the &s;ole direction of the a&s;&s;embly.

WHILE he held the reins of government, a&s;&s;umed on Sir Dan|vers O&s;borne's decea&s;e, the mini&s;try had none to in&s;pect his con|duct, or trace him thro' the mazy labyrinth of his politics. From him&s;elf came all their intelligence, and hence undoubted|ly none in his own disfavour. During the&s;e golden days of &s;ecurity and repo&s;e, he re&s;igned him&s;elf to plea&s;ure, and indul|ged his natural di&s;po&s;ition to voluptuou&s;ne&s;s and ea&s;e. The province, the mean while, was principally governed by his &s;e|cretary; who like a &s;econd Atlas, bore the chief burden of the &s;tate. Thus negligent of his politics, his popularity began to &s;uffer a manife&s;t declen&s;ion.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> It was moreover notably abridg|ed by his pa&s;&s;ing the charter before mentioned, repugnant by his own confe&s;&s;ion, to the dictates of his judgment.

<P>SIR CHARLES HARDY arrived in our harbour on the 2d of September 1755.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> The council immediately convened them&s;elves for his reception.

But the true &s;ecret was, to gain an opportunity for the Lieut. Governor,

The next day, the governor publi&s;hed his commi&s;&s;ion; and was, by Mr. De Lancey, invited to a public entertainment. In the evening they conducted him to the common, to hear the acclamations of the people; and on every occa&s;ion, followed him with &s;ervile court and adulation. To impre&s;s a high &s;en&s;e of his predece&s;&s;or's popularity, they &s;pared no pains. For this purpo&s;e al&s;o they intrigued with the a&s;&s;embly, and city corporation, two elective bodies, and thence under his influence. Of the latter, Mr. Oliver De Lancey, as alderman, was a member; and, with true fraternal affection, &s;timulated the board to in&s;ert in their addre&s;s a compliment to his brother. A mode&s;t motion, my Lord! and &s;o vehe|mently urged, that it was carried, tho' not without &s;ome op|po&s;ition.

The addre&s;s was calculated to &s;ecure De Lancey's power both with governor and people: the former, by di&s;playing to Sir Charles his formidable intere&s;t in that hou&s;e: the latter by preventing a di&s;&s;olution; than which no|thing was the object of greater dread. <Q><HI>It has, Sir, (the&s;e are the expre&s;&s;ions) been u&s;ual in this colony, at the acce&s;&s;ion of a new governor, to give the people an opportunity of a new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lyman builds a fort at the Car|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">act.</NOTE> Lyman had begun a fort at the landing, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's River, now called Fort Edward. About the latter end of the month, Gen. John&s;on, with the main body, moved forward 14 miles more northerly, and pitched his camp at the &s;outh end of Lake George, before called St. Sacrament.

ABOUT an hour after Williams's departure, a heavy fire was heard;

<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is de|feated, &amp; taken pri|&s;oner.</NOTE> Having now no command of any part of his army, except his handful of regulars, the baron thought proper to retire; which he did in very great di&s;order.

And whence he conjectured they had any reinforcements &s;o near at hand, as not to be able to join their routed detachment, &s;till remains one of tho&s;e arcana of &s;tate, which, by common under&s;tandings, is not to be fathomed: or, if the French con&s;i&s;ted of 200 grenadiers, 800 Canadians, and 700 Indians (the baron's account to the general) &s;o great a &s;laughter as is pretended by the letter, with the lo&s;s of the greate&s;t part of the principal officers, and Mon&s;. St. Pierre, who had the chief command and influence over the Indians, mu&s;t have reduced them to le&s;s than 800. From the&s;e, one would have imagined, there was no danger of a &s;econd attack. Fat more probable was it, that for &s;o momentous an enterprize as the reduction of the forts before-mentioned, the French had mu&s;tered all the Forces they could &s;pare from Crown Point and Tinonderoge, where mary of the regular troops were po&s;ted; e&s;pecially, as they went unfurni&s;hed with cannon.

Be&s;ides the ab&s;urdity of the accu&s;ation, that he could be acce&s;&s;ory to an omi&s;&s;ion of this nature, it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for him to know whether the enemy would at all risk an attack. Your Lord&s;hip will con&s;ider, the general was then at lea&s;t 365 miles from the place of action, nor advi&s;ed of it till nine days after it happened.

He thought proper to inform them of his intelligence concerning the &s;ituation and &s;trength of the enemy &mdash; which was to this purpo&s;e &mdash; That before he left the Oneida Carry-Place, two tru&s;ty Indians, with as many Albany traders, were &s;ent as &s;pies to Niagara; who, after fourteen days ab&s;ence, returned with an account &mdash; That the Indians had been two days in the French fort there, which was built partly of &s;tone, but principally of logs, being in a weak and ruinous condition &mdash; that the gar|ri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of about 60 French and 100 Indians, who &s;aid they had for &s;ome time expected 900 Indians and a quantity of &s;tores from Canada; but were apprehen&s;ive their ve&s;&s;els were taken &mdash; that letters came in frequently from Fort Du Que&s;ne, whence al&s;o they expected a con&s;iderable reinforcement. The &s;pies added, that the Indians were di&s;gu&s;ted at the divi&s;ion of the &s;po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, on the defeat of General Braddock, and that the French had lo&s;t 30 men in that engagement &mdash; that they &s;aw

<P>HIS EXCELLENCY al&s;o informed the council, that an Indian &s;py had been with the Outawawas, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the French in the action at Monongahela &mdash; that they had declared their in|clination to lay down the hatchet; and that others more we&s;t|erly gave the like intimations; which had induced him to di&s;|patch four me&s;&s;engers with belts of wampum, to invite them into our alliance, or at lea&s;t to engage their neutrality.</P>
<P>UPON the general's arrival at O&s;wego, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to procure intelligence from Frontenac; and for that purpo&s;e &s;ent out a party of white men and Indians, who returned a|bout the 8th of September, with information &mdash; that they land|ed upon an i&s;land, about &s;ix furlongs from the fort, from whence they had a full view of it &mdash; that it was built in a bay, near the edge of the water, and &s;urrounded by a &s;tone wall; the land behind it cleared, and ri&s;ing in a gradual acclivity &mdash; that two ve&s;&s;els, of about 40 tons each, lay moored in the harbour, unrigged, and without guns &mdash; that at the ea&s;t end of the fort there was a regular encampment, and &s;ix marquis tents; from the extent of which they imagined it contained a|bout 3 or 400 men. &mdash; Upon the &s;ide of the bay, oppo&s;ite the fort, the land projected about half a mile: between this and the i&s;land they were upon was another little i&s;land, about three quarters of a mile from the fort, inhabited by about twen|ty Indian families. The &s;pies added, that there were &s;everal other adjacent i&s;lands; but they di&s;covered no battoes. His ex|cellency farther acquainted the council, that an Indian that came to O&s;wego about the time of his arrival, and had left Fronte|nac nine days before, declared there were 30 French within the fort; a con&s;iderable quantity of powder, and many guns mounted on the &s;urrounding wall, which was about &s;ix feet thick; and the encampment without con&s;i&s;ted of 600 &s;oldiers. The information of Redhead, to the &s;ame effect, was al&s;o laid before
<PB N="57" REF="008163_0055_102E415316EB8DC0">the council, with the addition &mdash; that there were two encamp|ments, one of Canadians, and the other of regulars, in a hal|low, indi&s;coverable from the i&s;land; and that he was told by the commandant, of a much larger number of troops ex|pected with the general, lately arrived from France; when they propo&s;ed to inve&s;t O&s;wego. Gen. John&s;on's l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter of the 1&s;t of September, &s;ignifying, that his &s;couts informed him of the departure of 300 canoes to Frontenac, was al&s;o con&s;ider|ed: and from the&s;e articles of intelligence &mdash; the account of the arrival of the French troops &mdash; the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all intercour&s;e between Frontenac and Niagara &mdash; and their lying &s;till &s;o long at the former; his excellency ob&s;erved, it was not improbable their de&s;ign might be to make a de&s;cent on O&s;wego, if the whole force proceeded on the expedition to Niagara, which was about 150 miles to the we&s;tward; and from whence, at that advanced &s;ea&s;on, they could not return in le&s;s than 30 days. That this was the more probable, as O&s;wego was of the greate&s;t importance for &s;ecuring the frontiers of the we&s;tern colonies, maintaining the Briti&s;h dominion over the great lakes, and the country beyond the Apalachean mountains. He al&s;o took notice of the defencele&s;s &s;tate of O&s;wego, which would render it nece&s;|&s;ary to leave a &s;trong garri&s;on there: that the number of ef|fectives at that time in the three regiments and independent com|panies, including &s;erjeants and corporals, amounted to 1376; and that the irregulars, who were Albany men and Indians, procu|red by his own emi&s;&s;aries, con&s;i&s;ted only of 120. For the bet|ter &s;ecurity of the place, the general had ordered to be built, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, a &s;trong wooden fort, capable of moun|ting cannon, with pickets and a ditch, on a high point, com|manding the old fort on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river. This he ob&s;erved was already begun, and would &s;oon be compleated: and that for the propo&s;ed enterprize, he had built and equipped a &s;loop and &s;chooner of &s;ixty tons each, two row-gallies, each of twenty tons, with eight whale-boats, each capable of carry|ing &s;ixteen men. He then informed them of his intention to embark for Niagara, as &s;oon as the expected convoy arrived, with 600 regulars, including gunners and matro&s;&s;es, be&s;ides the Albany and Indian irregulars, one 18 pounder, four 12 pounders, a ten-inch mortar, a &s;even-inch hoyet, two royals, and five &s;mall &s;wivel-hoyets, the ve&s;&s;els, whale-boats, and a competent number
<PB N="58" REF="008163_0056_102E411625185E50">of battoes; leaving behind him 700 effectives, two 12 pounders, ten 6 pounders, &s;ix 3 pounders, and eight cohorns.</P>
<P>THE council, upon this repre&s;entation, were unanimou&s;ly of opinion, in an&s;wer to the &s;everal que&s;tions propo&s;ed, that the force intended for the Niagara expedition was &s;ufficient: but with re&s;pect to O&s;wego, &s;ome imagined it would not be de|fen&s;ible: the majority, however, were of contrary &s;entiments. All agreed, that a feint upon Frontenac, while his excellency was gone to Niagara, was by no means advi&s;eable. They univer|&s;ally concurred in opinion, that a fort ought to be erected on the we&s;t &s;ide of the old fort: and that it would be for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice to prepare materials for building one or more ve&s;&s;els, larger than any of tho&s;e already upon the lake, capable of mounting ten 6 pounders, be&s;ides &s;wivels, two more row-gallies, and a 100 good whale-boats.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this advice,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara|tions to proceed on the Niagara expedition</NOTE> 600 regulars were draughted, the artillery and ordnance-&s;tores &s;hipped on board the &s;loop On|tario, part of the provi&s;ions on board the &s;loop O&s;wego, and the re&s;idue was ready for the row-gallies, whaleboats, and battoes. While the&s;e preparations were making, the weather was extremely wet and tempe&s;tuous. The rains began to fall &s;o heavily on the 18th of the month, that on the be&s;t cho&s;en ground the tents of the &s;oldiers were overwhelmed. As 400 of the troops mu&s;t have gone in open boats, it was impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s the lake with any &s;afety, till the &s;torm abated; which was on the 26th of the month, when orders were immediately i&s;&s;ued for the embarkation of the troops: but the&s;e could not be carried into execution. Tho' the rains cea&s;ed for a &s;hort &s;pace of time,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which could not be pro&s;e|cuted from the bad|ne&s;s of the wea|ther.</NOTE> the we&s;tern winds began to blow with redoubled fury; and were again &s;uc|ceeded by continual rains for thirteen days together. During this boi&s;terous weather, numbers fell &s;ick, who&s;e tents were an in|&s;ufficient &s;helter: and the Indians, well acquainted with the cli|mate, went off, declaring the &s;ea&s;on too far advanced to admit of an expedition upon the lake.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of the&s;e difficulties another council,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another council of war held.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ting of the &s;ame members who compo&s;ed the la&s;t, was called on the 27th of September. The general acquainted them with the unto|ward

He ob|&s;erved as follows &mdash; That the preceeding day, eight battoes were arrived, with 48 barrels of flour, and 13 of bread; &s;o that there was then 14 days full allowance of tho&s;e &s;pecies of provi&s;ions for 2000, being the number then in his camp &mdash; That he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to take with him 21,000 weight of bread and flour, which for 700 men, forty days, amounted only to three-fourths of the u&s;ual allowance &mdash; that, in &s;uch ca&s;e, there would be le&s;t with the garri&s;on only 8000 weight of bread and flour, at half allowance for only 12 days: but, by advices received from the Carrying-Place and Mohawk River, he had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to expect &s;uch a quantity of pro|vi&s;ions, in a few days, as would be a full &s;upply for &s;ome months&mdash; that a party of men with two officers, in whale-boats, &s;ent &s;even days before to Frontenac to di&s;cover the enemy's mo|tions, were returned, with the following report &mdash; That they went into the harbour, and &s;aw the fort, which appeared to be a regular &s;quare faced with &s;tone, having four embra&s;ures in the front &mdash; that the encampment con&s;i&s;ted of above 100 tents&mdash; that two brigantines of about 40 tons each, and a &s;mall &s;loop lying then at anchor, were rigged, and the &s;ails of one of them bent: and a number of battoes lay near the walls of the fort. He communicated to them al&s;o a copy of the orders and in&s;truc|tions given to the French regulars &s;ent thither; which were taken from baron Die&s;kau, in the action at Lake George: whence it appeared, that ten companies of the Queen's battalion marched from Montreal to Cadaracqui, in two divi&s;ions, upon the fir&s;t and &s;econd of Augu&s;t, together with 250 Canadians, exclu&s;ive of Indians: the number of men therefore at Frontenac, inclu|ding the garri&s;on, might amount to 1000 effectives, originally de&s;igned, as appears from tho&s;e papers, for an attack upon O&s;|wego. He farther took notice of the departure of &s;ome of our Indians, and their unanimous opinion, that the attempt a|gain&s;t Niagara could not &s;ucceed this &s;ea&s;on: on which account the remainder were re&s;olved to return to their re&s;pective ca&s;tles; giving neverthele&s;s the highe&s;t a&s;&s;urances of their willingne&s;s to join us in much greater numbers in the &s;pring&mdash;that the Albany tra|ders were of the &s;ame opinion, that the battoes, tho' well adapted for the navigation of &s;mall rivers, could not live on the lake in &s;uch tempe&s;tuous weather as had continued for a fortnight

That there were then but few proper battoe|men at O&s;wego: nor could they be provided with a &s;ufficient number, as tho&s;e who under&s;tood the management of battoes were chiefly employed in the tran&s;portation of provi&s;ions from Schenectady to O&s;wego, and from Albany to Lake George; and that the &s;oldiers were unable to conduct them to Niagara, the lake being turbulent generally five days in &s;ix.</P>
<P>THE advice of the council, my Lord, was unanimou&s;ly to this effect &mdash; That the arrival of the battoes with provi&s;ions,
<PB N="61" REF="008163_0059_102E41583A9B47D8">tho' hourly expected, was by no means to be depended upon, there being &s;calping parties in the neighbourhood; one of which, &s;ince the la&s;t council of war, had actually killed three, and captivated two of the work-men employed in building the new fort on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river: and the cutting off the battoes was the more to be apprehended, as the Indians in our alliance were now returning to their ca&s;tles. Nor did they think it advi&s;eable to ri&s;k the troops in battoes upon the lake, at &s;o advanced a &s;ea&s;on of the year. They approved his excel|lency's intention of rai&s;ing barracks for the &s;oldiers without de|lay; and thought the fort on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Onon|daga River ought to be compleated as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and again advi&s;ed the erection of a work for mounting cannon on the eminence we&s;t of the old &s;ort &mdash; all which, in there opi|nion, could not be effected before the winter was too far &s;et in, without employing the whole &s;trength than at the place.

<P>THIS advice, my Lord,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which was carri|ed into execution.</NOTE> the general proceeded immediately to carry into execution. Compleating the fort on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, was a matter of principal attention, becau&s;e &s;ituated on a high point of land, at 100 yards di&s;tance from the lake, commanding the ground round about it&mdash; the old fort at 450 yards di&s;tance &mdash; and the entrance of the harbour. Its circumference was 800 feet, being built of legs from 20 to 30 inches diameter, and the outer wall 14 feet high. Round it was to be a ditch 14 feet broad and 10 deep.

<PB N="64" REF="008163_0062_102E411DC7422398">abounds with provi&s;ions; and in &s;uch quarters, your Lord&s;hip is &s;en&s;ible, his Maje&s;ty's troops <HI>will</HI> not want nece&s;&s;aries; e&s;pe|cially <HI>fuel,</HI> in a country covered with timber. Where then the probability, that the forces, which con&s;i&s;ted of 1200, would &s;uffer in a po&s;t like this? As to the affair of barracks, my Lord, there was a council held at New York, on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, when the news arrived of Col. Dunbar's retiring into winter-quarters, after Braddock's defeat. It was compo&s;ed of Mr. De Lancey the Lieut. Governor, Me&s;&s;. Alexander, Ken|nedy, Murray, Holland, Chambers, and Smith; and the opinion of that board then was, <Q><HI>That not only the King's forces to the &s;outhward, but el&s;e tho&s;e that could be &s;pared from Nova Scotia, &s;hould quarter near Albany, for any future operations.</HI></Q> This re&s;olve Mr. De Lancey tran&s;mitted to the general at O&s;|wego; and as Dunbar's troops were ordered to Albany, for the defence of that Country, and particularly to make a &s;tand, in ca&s;e the provincials were defeated; they had, methink, the highe&s;t rea&s;on to expect favour from the inhabitants, and the &s;pecial countenance of the government, even had they been quartered upon them as u&s;ual: and which at pre&s;ent is actually the ca&s;e, by expre&s;s orders of my Lord Loudon. The general, I &s;ay, had no rea&s;on to expect, upon this head, any oppo&s;ition from the civil magi&s;trate. But Sir Charles Hardy, on his arrival at Albany, about the 26th of September, &s;ignified to him by letter, his apprehen&s;ions of unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;ing among the inhabitants, &s;hould the &s;oldiers be quartered upon private families; and wi&s;hed to have his excellency's orders for building barracks, both there and at Schenectady; le&s;t his a&s;&s;embly &s;hould not chu&s;e to put the pro|vince to that charge. He al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed his hopes, if &s;uch an expence was &s;aved them, of their greater readine&s;s to rai&s;e more men, &s;hould the &s;ervice require it, the next campaign. The general's an&s;wer to this letter equally demon&s;trated his integrity to the crown, and concern for the troops. He intimated his fears, that the con&s;truction of barracks would be thought an extraordinary ex|pence; but it being nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ervice, that Dunbar's, and the regiment of the late Sir Peter Halket, &s;hould winter in Albany and Schenectady, he complied with Sir Charles's re|que&s;t; and de&s;ired him to provide barracks for tho&s;e regi|ments with all po&s;&s;ible diligence, that the troops on their arrival in his government, might not find them&s;elves de&s;titute of quar|ters.
<PB N="65" REF="008163_0063_102E415FAD186B18">To relieve the crown in the expence, he farther took notice to Sir Charles, of the reque&s;t made by his own government for drawing the&s;e troops to Albany &mdash; that they would in a &s;pecial manner cover the frontier of New York &mdash; be of &s;ervice to O&s;wego in the en&s;uing &s;pring &mdash; and that the inhabitants would draw very large &s;ums from their re&s;idence among&s;t them. Nor did he for|get to recommend an imitation of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay; who thought it rea&s;onable to erect barracks for his own regiment tho' they knew their continuance among them would be &s;hort, de&s;tined as they were for the we&s;tern expedition. But that there might be no delay in building the barracks, ari&s;ing from any doubt of the expence being paid by the province of New York, Mr. Shirley informed Sir Charles, that if they would not, after the&s;e con&s;ide|rations, take that expence on them&s;elves, he would defray it out of the contingent-money in the hands of the deputy pay-ma&s;ter. Thus, my Lord, if any ground for complaint of the want of barracks, Mr. Shirley 'tis clear was intirely un&s;en&s;urable: and if the troops, as this libeller informs us, did &s;uffer in their tents,&mdash; I &s;ubmit it to your Lord&s;hip, who&s;e province it was to have found them better quarters. But the fact is, that the barracks were fini&s;hed, and the troops quartered in them before the fir&s;t of December, fuel provided for them &s;ufficient for the winter, and all at the expence of the crown.</P>
<P>THE winter now approaching, commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed by the governments concerned in the Crown Point expedition, to a&s;certain their re&s;pective quotas for garri&s;oning the forts <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>William-Henry,</HI> and di&s;banding the re&s;t of the army. After this was compleated, the general and Sir Charles Hardy returned to New York; where the former convened a grand congre&s;s of governors and field officers, to deliberate on a plan for the operations of the &s;ucceeding campaign. But before I enter upon their tran&s;actions, I &s;hall briefly lay before your Lord&s;hip tho&s;e between Sir Charles Hardy and his a&s;&s;embly; which was opened on the &s;econd, and continued &s;itting till the 23d of December.</P>
<P>I HAVE already ob&s;erved, that the mini&s;try,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tran&s;acti|ons in New York between Sir Charles Hardy and his a&s;&s;em|bly.</NOTE> from the time of Mr. Clinton's departure in 1753, had been &s;olicitous about procu|ring the con&s;ent of our a&s;&s;embly to a law e&s;tabli&s;hing a permanent provi&s;ion for the governor, and other nece&s;&s;ary officers. When Sir Danvers O&s;borne arrived, he brought with him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;truction for that purpo&s;e; from the terms of which it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> apparent that the
<PB N="66" REF="008163_0064_102E412291F36DB0">mini&s;try had it much at heart; and Sir Danvers, before he left England, was made to believe that Mr. De Lancey, by means of his great popularity, would enable him to carry it into execution. This I had from a gentleman, to whom Sir Danvers opened him&s;elf, and whom he con&s;uited before his embarkation for his government. The gentleman is a per&s;on of the fir&s;t figure in the&s;e colonies; and being acquainted with the &s;y&s;tem of politics in New-York, he informed Sir Danvers, that tho&s;e promi&s;es were by no means to be depended upon: that Mr. De Lancey was inexpre&s;&s;ibly jealous of his a&s;cendancy over the a&s;&s;embly, who were utterly di&s;inclined to a perpetual &s;upport: that he would join in no mea&s;ures that might weaken the confidence they repo&s;ed in him: that as long as he maintained his influence in their coun&s;els, he would virtually be the governor of the province; and there|fore upon the whole, his intere&s;t and ambition would infallibly lead him to keep every governor in a &s;tate of dependence upon him. Sir Danvers di&s;liked &s;o di&s;agreeable a prediction; and many are of opinion, that its accompli&s;hment ha&s;tened his un|happy fate. Excu&s;e me, my Lord, for troubling you with a relation of facts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anecdote of Sir Danvers O&s;borne.</NOTE> a little out of the &s;trict order of time. There is an anecdote of Sir Danvers, of which I would not have your Lord&s;hip uninformed. He arrived here on the 7th of October, 1753, under very di&s;couraging apprehen&s;ions of the people; and indeed not without rea&s;on, the oppo&s;ition again&s;t Mr. Clinton having been carried beyond all decorum. Governor O&s;born<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s commi&s;&s;ion, thro' Mr. Clinton's ab&s;ence, remained unpubli&s;hed till the third day after his arrival. This is u&s;ually done, fir&s;t privately in the council-chamber; and immediately after, in the mo&s;t public manner at the city-hall. To wait on his excellency thither, Mr. Clinton came abroad; an a&s;toni&s;hing crowd being a&s;&s;embled at the Fort Gate, to attend the proce&s;&s;ion. Mr. Clin|ton's enemies were very a&s;&s;iduous in exciting the popular accla|mations; and the huzzas of the mob were &s;carce intermitted for a moment. There appeared, in &s;hort &s;uch a profu&s;ion of joy, accompanied with &s;ome indecent expre&s;&s;ions re&s;pecting him&s;elf, as gave Mr. Clinton ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect more open indignities. He therefore &s;oon took his leave of Sir Danvers, who expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;plea&s;ure at the conduct of his enemies. This, my Lord, proved a day of general fe&s;tivity and Bacchanalian frolic. In the evening, the city was illuminated: the common blazed
<PB N="67" REF="008163_0065_102E41613704FDD0">with bonfires: great was the con&s;umption of Madeira; and every company rung with maledictions again&s;t the late com|mander in chief, who was charged as the &s;ole procurer of the new in&s;truction; an account of which could only have tran&s;pired from &s;ome of the council. Sir Danvers alone appeared unaffec|ted with our intemperate revels; and on his countenance &s;at a melancholly gloom. He convened the council on Thur&s;day the eleventh of the month; and prayed their &s;entiments on the probability of obtaining a permanent &s;upport, according to his in&s;tructions. That the point was unattainable, they all delivered as their unanimous opinion. He then required the &s;olution of the &s;ame que&s;tion from each member &s;everally; and &s;till from each received the &s;ame reply. Upon this, he turned him&s;elf about in apparent di&s;tre&s;s, uttered a deep &s;igh, and reclining his head again&s;t a window, in a di&s;ponding accent &s;aid, <Q>What then am I come hither for?</Q> The next morning &mdash; But I de&s;i&s;t. This in&s;truction, as your Lord&s;hip will be plea&s;e to recollect, remained unrevoked all the time of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or: and 'tis natural to expect, that the people of this province were very inqui&s;itive whether it was continued to Governor Hardy&mdash;They were &s;o. But Sir Charles did not follow the example of Mr. De Lancey, in laying his in&s;tructions before the a&s;&s;embly. The article relative to the &s;upport has undergone, as I am credibly informed, very few alterations, and tho&s;e only in the preamble. That it was in &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame, is evident from his &s;peech to the hou&s;e, on the 3d of December, at the opening of that &s;e&s;&s;ion. His words are the&s;e: <Q><HI>I am commanded by his Ma|je&s;ty to recommend in his name without delay,</HI>

But Sir Charles was to be treated in a diffe|rent manner, and mea&s;ures more lenient were to be pur&s;ued. An a&s;cendancy over him would en&s;ure to his lieutenant many advan|tages; and enable him to procure the governor's a&s;&s;ent to a bill, for paying him a large &s;um, now due for his &s;alary and other per|qui&s;ites, while he had the chief command.

<P>HE then ob&s;erved, that if the &s;everal attempts upon Crown Point, the forts upon the lakes, and the Ohio, were not pro|&s;ecuted at the &s;ame time, very perilous might be the con&s;equences: That if in particular, while Frontenac and Niagara were attacked, no attempt was made again&s;t Crown Point, the whole force of Canada would march to oppo&s;e us; which would defeat the de&s;ign, and require &s;o large a body of troops, as to render the tran&s;portation of nece&s;&s;aries to O&s;wego impracticable. So nume|rous an army might al&s;o march again&s;t Albany, as effectually to cut off the retreat of our forces, or at lea&s;t totally ob&s;truct their &s;upplies: That &s;hould, on the contrary, our whole &s;trength be de&s;tined for Crown Point, and the we&s;tern operations neglected; O&s;wego, the grand object of the French, was in the utmo&s;t dan|ger of falling into their hands.

<P>A PLAN &s;o well dige&s;ted, and &s;o clearly &s;tated,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which was ap|proved, with &s;ome little alte|rations.</NOTE> required but little con&s;ideration; and accordingly it was in the main unani|mou&s;ly approved.

<P><HI>NOTHING now remains but to &s;hew, that the office of chief ju&s;tice and governor of your province are incon&s;i&s;tent.

</LETTER>
<P>PERHAPS, my Lord, no higher evidence can be a&s;&s;igned of a man's influence, than &s;uch a bold inva&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's prerogative. Mr. De Lancey was determined not to lo&s;e an office, which he knew to be the grand &s;ource of his popularity, and the main prop
<PB N="80" REF="008163_0078_102E413180664B80">of his power. For, whoever is chief ju&s;tice of the province, unle&s;s a very device, mu&s;t be the &s;econd man in the government. Go|vernor Hardy made no oppo&s;ition to this large &s;tride of ambition: and the other not long after, by his wonderful artifice, &s;ubjected him to his ab&s;olute dominion. It was effected in the following manner &mdash; Your Lord&s;hip will be plea&s;ed to recollect,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">De La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y obliges the go|vernor to pa&s;s two acts of a&s;|&s;embly.</NOTE> that Mr. De Lancey had the addre&s;s to prevail upon the a&s;&s;embly to &s;end up a bill to the council, on the 4th of February, intituled, <Q><HI>An Act for the Payment of the Debts due from this Colony; and other pur|po&s;es therein mentioned</HI></Q> By this, payments were to be made to many creditors of the government, <HI>for &s;ervices done this colony,</HI> without &s;peci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ying what tho&s;e &s;ervices were. The lieut governor was to receive 378<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 16 <ABBR>s</ABBR> and &s;everal other &s;ums were payable to his brother. It was in reality a bill for di&s;charging the arrears due to the ordinary officers of the government. To render it the more palatable to the governor, provi&s;ion was made for paying him al&s;o large &s;ums for pre&s;ents to the Indians, and the expences of his voyage to Albany, after the French repul&s;e at Lake George. When it came up to the council, it obtained a majority only by one voice: and of the&s;e, my Lord, two gentlemen, be&s;ides lieut. gov. De Lancey, were them&s;elves intere&s;ted in the bill. They were the pui&s;ne judges of the &s;upreme court, Me&s;&s;. Hor&s;emanden and Chambers, who&s;e arrears of &s;alary were now by the act to be di&s;|charged. Mo&s;&s;. Colden, Alexander, and Smith looked upon it, as a mean inva&s;ion of the King's in&s;tructions, which, until they re|&s;igned their &s;eats at the council board, they were bound in honour to regard with &s;acred punctuality. &mdash; It was be&s;ides evidently par|tial; no provi&s;ion being made for other creditors, who&s;e demands were indi&s;putable. They al&s;o conceived it derogatory to the digni|ty of that board, to pa&s;s an act, excluding them&s;elves from any knowledge of tho&s;e &s;ervices, for which the re&s;pective &s;ums were made payable. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, among others, they oppo&s;ed the bill; and prayed their di&s;&s;ent might be entered, as a vindication of them&s;elves to his Maje&s;ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The governor to whom it was &s;ent up, detained it for farther con&s;ideration; tho' he pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal other bil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s on the 19th of the month. This circum&s;tance, my Lord, could not but chag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in his lieutenant, who had the bill much at heart; not only on ac|count of the large &s;ums thereby payable to him&s;elf and brother; but becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;ing it into a law, would be the fulle&s;t evidence of his a&s;cendancy over the governor; and if he could bring him
<PB N="81" REF="008163_0079_102E417442B4DB18">into di&s;grace with the mini&s;try, by leading him into a breach of in&s;tructions, it was plain he would have nothing to rely upon, but his own popularity. This was an important card, and to be &s;kil|fully played off. So indeed it was: and when I fini&s;h the &s;tory, I am per&s;uaded your Lord&s;hip will entertain to very mean opinion of American politicians.&mdash;The &s;pring was now advancing; and it became nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s a law for levying forces, not only to join the ea&s;tern colonies, on a new expedition again&s;t the French fortre&s;s at Crown Point, but for the protection of our we&s;tern frontiers, in conjunction with Penn&s;ylvania and New Jer&s;ey, which were become fields of blood, by the daily ravages of inhuman barbarians. The bill for this purpo&s;e originated with the a&s;&s;embly: and Mr. De Lancey, who was now clo&s;eting the members, was its principal con&s;tructor. When it came before the council on the 28th of March, that board immediately objected to it, according to his ex|pectations: and the governor declared, that if the council approved, he &s;hould him&s;elf give it a negative. According to the tenor of this bill, the forces de&s;igned for the we&s;tern expedition were to &s;erve but forty days, when the province of New Jer&s;ey had ordained their quota, to be di&s;bandable by Mr. Belcher: and Sir Charles Hardy in&s;i&s;ted, that the like confidence ought to be repo&s;ed in his judgment. The two hou&s;es now engaged them&s;elves in a di&s;pute, at a time when, of all others, every contention &s;hould have been avoided. Mr. Oliver De Lancey, appointed by the hou&s;e to provide the &s;upplies for the regiment de&s;igned as our quota towards the Crown Point expedition, now gave orders to &s;top all farther preparations, an open rupture between the governor and a&s;&s;embly being daily ex|pected. The members began freely to &s;peak again&s;t him. The council laboured to procure an alteration of the bill &mdash; but all to no purpo&s;e. The principal thing aimed at, was the pa&s;&s;ing of the debt-bill: and a leading member in the hou&s;e plainly intimated their de&s;igns to the governor. Doubtle&s;s your Lord&s;hip will won|der he did not di&s;&s;olve them with indignation. Believe me, my Lord, it would have been a &s;tep, at this time, extremely unadvi&s;ea|ble. Forty days intermi&s;&s;ion between the te&s;t and return of the writ of &s;ummons for the election of repre&s;entatives, being required by law; the public exigencies were too pre&s;&s;ing to admit of any delay. Mr. De Lancey knew all his advantages: and that Sir Charles Hardy might be at no lo&s;s to conjecture that the hou&s;e was now acting at his beck, nor him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of
<PB N="82" REF="008163_0080_102E413309B24CC0">joining with the council again&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill, ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the con&s;ultations of that board. The ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">bouring colonies in the mean time were urging the di&s;patch of our preparations for opening the campaign. Reduced at length by the&s;e perplexities, he was obliged to &s;end for his lieutenant, and gave him his promi&s;e to pa&s;s the favourite bill for payment of the public debts. The hou&s;e then privately took back the quota-bill; and after a few alterations, the council pa&s;&s;ed it on the 31&s;t of March. To both of them Sir Charles gave his a&s;&s;ent the following day: and they were enrolled among our laws. I leave this affair to your Lord&s;hip's own reflections; ob&s;erving only, that from this period, the lieutenant governor's influence became more apparent than before &mdash; and that as it always was, &s;o it will ever continue to be, his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and the grand engine of his politics, to cru&s;h or controul the King's governors in this province.</P>
<P>THE plan of operations,

<P>ABOUT this time one Rogers, of New Hamp&s;hire, capt. of a ranging company,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capt Ro|gers, an active of|ficer, gains intelli|gence; of which the general informs the coun|cil.</NOTE> gave repeated demon&s;trations of his activity in the neighbourhood of Crown Point. He made many incur&s;ions upon the enemy, fell on their &s;cattered parties, and &s;carce ever re|turned to Fort William-Henry without &s;calps and pri&s;oners. The general took particular notice of him; and he became &s;ingularly &s;erviceable in procuring intelligence. By a cadet, whom he took on the 20th of May, we were informed, that the whole number of men at Fort St. Frederic, Tinonderoge, and at an advanced po&s;t, were 1100, compo&s;ed of the regiments of Languedoc, the Queen's regiment, two companies of the colony troops, and the militia. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there were Indians; but their numbers uncertain: that at Tinonderoge the French had twelve pieces of ordnance mounted, and carriages preparing for an additional number; but that the retrenchment at the advanced po&s;t was without any can|non. The&s;e troops wintered at Montreal and Chambly; and ar|rived at the &s;outh end of the lake about the middle of April, be|ing plentifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ions and mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tary &s;tores.&mdash;The&s;e intelligences the general laid before his council; and then ob&s;erved that the 50th and 51&s;t regiments, the four independent com|panies, and the regiment of New Jer&s;ey, were &s;carce a third part of the number of troops de&s;igned by the general plan for the opera|tions upon Lake Ontario: that the provincials were al&s;o not only

<P>YOUR Lord&s;hip may hence ob&s;erve, what rea&s;on the congre&s;s in December had for their opinion, that more troops were nece&s;&s;ary for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice in America. No reinforcements being yet arrived from England, for carrying the general plan into exe|cution, the council were of unanimous opinion&mdash;that 1300 ought to be po&s;ted at O&s;wego, 50 at the Falls,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their o|pinion and advice.</NOTE> 200 at the Oneida Car|rying Place, 150 at the German Flatts, and as many more at the Conejohary Falls. They advi&s;ed therefore, &mdash; that the 50th and 51&s;t, and the New Jer&s;ey regiments, the independents, and the North Carolina provincials (all which amounted to about 2000 men) &s;hould be employed in that &s;ervice. The 44th and 48th regiments, with the colony troops, were thought &s;ufficient to re|duce Crown Point. Accordingly, they recommended their junc|tion: advi&s;ing, however, that the regulars &s;hould continue for a time in their encampment at Albany. &mdash; The ranging companies, propo&s;ed by the general, were highly approved; and the rai&s;ing of others &s;trongly recommended. They al&s;o concurred with him in &s;entiment &mdash; that a road ought to be made from the German Flatts to O&s;wego: and declared, it appeared to them very nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;trengthen Fort Edward, and erect another at the South Bay, The former was a depo&s;it for &s;tores, and at the concurrence of all the routes from Crown Point to Albany. The latter would com|mand the route taken by baron Die&s;kan for his de&s;igned attack upon Fort Edward &mdash; a route thro' which incur&s;ions were frequent|ly made upon our northern frontier.

<P>THUS I have &s;hewn your Lord&s;hip the rea&s;ons why the general plan continued to be unexecuted, till the &s;itting of this la&s;t council of war.

This, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, was done to induce his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, from the&s;e ample &s;upplies, to act upon this quarter; it being univer&s;ally imagined, that Crown Point was now become the main object of the mini&s;try. Till the arrival of General Webb on the 7th of June, this was only conjecture, and general report. The effects of the mi&s;repre&s;en|tations of American affairs in England, then became evident to all; for the &s;tores laid in at Schenectady were now reconveyed to Albany for the nothern expedition; and fre&s;h clamours excited again&s;t Mr. Shirley, for his &s;upplies towards the we&s;tern operations. On the 15th of June,

This, tho' one of the mo&s;t judicious mea&s;ures that could have been taken, was made the &s;ubject of low invective.

General Shirley wi&s;ely fore&s;aw, that the Indians of the Six Nations, whatever influence over them Sir William John|&s;on might pretend, could not be engaged even to protect the King's troops in the pa&s;&s;age thro' their own country; and that unle&s;s the communication was kept open to O&s;wego, nothing could be effec|ted upon the Lake, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the garri&s;on it&s;elf pre&s;erved from falling into the hands of the enemy. Accordingly,

Nothing could &s;ecure us again&s;t the repetition of the&s;e in|&s;ults, but pa&s;&s;ing through the country with large &s;quadrons of battoes: and to facilitate the tran&s;portation, Mr. Shirley, who can|va&s;&s;ed every expedient for the pre&s;ervation of O&s;wego, employed a working party of 80 men, under a director, to remove the ob|&s;tructions in the Wood Creek; by this means, the portage from the Mohawks River, acro&s;s the great Carrying-Place, was reduced from eight miles to one. Nor did he omit ob&s;erving to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, that an attempt upon Niagara was of the la&s;t importance; the lo&s;s or pre&s;ervation of our Indians depending upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the operations on Lake Ontario.</P>

<P>YOUR LORDSHIP may remember,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Sharpe's de&s;igned attempt on fort Du Que&s;ne fails.</NOTE> that an attempt was propo|&s;ed, at the congre&s;s in December, again&s;t Fort Du Que&s;ne, with an army of 3000 provincials.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circum|&s;tances of Indian af|fairs to the north ward.</NOTE> and upon his return, as I before ob&s;erved to your Lord&s;hip, he propo&s;ed to the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, and Oneidas, the erection of &s;mall forts for the protection of their re&s;pective ca&s;tles.

<P>BEFORE Mr. Shirley left O&s;wego the la&s;t year, he propo&s;ed to the Six Nations their convening this &s;ummer, in a grand council there, the Indians on the north &s;ide of lake Ontario, and round lake Erie, to con&s;ult their common intere&s;t, and maintain a corre&s;pon|dence by annual councils at O&s;wego. And to draw off the latter from their attachment to the French, recommended to the Six Nations their concurrence, in opening a free trade with the foreign Indians, at the entrance of the Onondaga river, upon terms more advantageous to all the Indians than any hitherto pur&s;ued. This &s;pring Sir William John&s;on informed his excellency, that the Six
<PB N="89" REF="008163_0087_102E417CC9B7C718">Nations were extremely well plea&s;ed with the projects relating both to the trade at O&s;wego, and the con&s;truction of forts in their can|tons. To accelerate the latter, the general &s;upplied him with 5000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling, in addition to 5000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> advanced to him by General Brad|dock: and yet, my Lord, he was con&s;trained to confe&s;s, in a &s;ub|&s;equent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">10 May, 1756.</NOTE> letter, that unle&s;s his excellency could engage &s;everal companies of rangers, he de&s;paired of the pre&s;ervation even of a free pa&s;&s;age thro' their country: and whether he has to this day built a &s;ingle fort, as the general propo&s;ed, I have not been able, after much inquiry, to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>EQUALLY unpromi&s;ing was the &s;ituation of our affairs with the &s;outhern Indians.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of our af|faires with the &s;ou|thern In|dians.</NOTE> Some hopes indeed were entertained of the fidelity of the Cherokees &mdash; a people warlike and powerful; in who&s;e territories the Virginians were erecting a fortre&s;s. The Shawane&s;e neverthele&s;s continued their eruptions into that province: and Go|vernor Dinwiddie was obliged to draft the militia, to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s, and pre&s;erve the town of Winche&s;ter. The&s;e Indians al|&s;o, with the Su&s;quehanas and Delawares, committed frequent ho&s;|tilities upon the Pen&s;ylvanians. Governour Morris, for the pro|tection of the country, carried a line of forts on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Kittatiny mountains, all along the extended frontier of that colony, from Delaware to the river Potowmac. The government of New Jer&s;ey proceeded even to declare war again&s;t the Delaware Indians; and would have penetrated into their &s;ettlements, had not a&s;&s;urances been &s;ent by Sir William John&s;on from the council at Onondaga, that the Delawares and Shawane&s;e, in obedience to the Six Nations, were under renewed and po&s;&s;itive engagements, to refrain from any farther outrages upon the &s;outhern frontiers. If any &s;uch promi&s;es were really made, 'tis certain they were immedi|ately broken, many of our inhabitants having &s;ince been murdered and captivated by the &s;avages of tho&s;e very tribes. Whence we may fairly conclude, that either the Six Nations connived at the&s;e infractions of their commands; or that their antient &s;overeignty is become the contempt of their tributaries. In fact, my Lord, the matter is &s;till wor&s;e. Too much rea&s;on is there to believe the truth of both the&s;e alternatives.</P>
<P>I INFORMED your Lord&s;hip,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Willi|am John|&s;on's con|duct con|&s;idered.</NOTE> that Sir William John&s;on was order|ed to proceed from Onondaga to O&s;wego, with as many Indians
<PB N="90" REF="008163_0088_102E413F8E4D54C8">as could be per&s;waded to march with him; not only for the more effectual pre&s;ervation of that po&s;t, but to execute the plan which Gen. Shirley had concerted, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an annual coun|cil there, with tho&s;e Indians who had been long in the French in|tere&s;t, and &s;eemed ready to li&s;ten to propo&s;als for an alliance with us. It was expedient, my Lord, that he &s;hould have complied with the&s;e in&s;tructions, nay it was his duty; but no &s;ooner was he acquainted with Mr. Shirley's re&s;ignation of the command of the army, than he returned from Onondaga to Albany, at the head of about 60 Indians; leaving Capt. Patten with his company of gre|nadiers, to wander thro' a forlorn wilderne&s;s, in &s;earch of O&s;wego. Whether this in&s;tance of his conduct was not intended to rai&s;e his reputation with the new general, as a leading man among the In|dians, I leave to your Lord&s;hip's conjecture. By arts like the&s;e, he acquired his Indian fame: and the influence of the faction at New York &s;o powerfully &s;u&s;tained it, that few per&s;ons doubted his ability to procure &s;everal hundred warriors for our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, tho' every day exhibited fre&s;h proofs of their melancholy defection. Be&s;ides the de&s;truction of our po&s;t in the very country of the One|idas mentioned before, the enemy infe&s;ted the parts about O&s;wego, and the whole pa&s;&s;age thither, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition from the Six Nations. Alarms indeed were frequently given of the ap|proach of their flying parties; and it was ob&s;ervable, that Sir. Wil|liam John&s;on, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, as Colonel of the county, rai&s;ed the militia of Albany, and proceeded to the &s;pot; tho' every man acquainted with Indians well knows, that of all places, the&s;e are the mo&s;t unlikely for finding the enemy. By &s;uch &s;ham expediti|ons have our northern inhabitants been impoveri&s;hed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: nor could they an&s;wer any other end, than to rai&s;e a bruit thro' the colonies; and with parade and o&s;tentation &s;et the gazetteers upon &s;ounding his applau&s;e. &mdash; Even in the&s;e wild romantic excur&s;ions, but few Indians attended him: and yet if we credit our news wri|ters, hundreds were in his train.</P>
<P>MR. SHIRLEY had &s;carce re&s;igned the command to Major Ge|neral Abercrombie,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of a gal|lant action of our bat|to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> men under Capt.

Sen&s;ible of the importance of O&s;wego, the enemy col|lected them&s;elves about the latter end of May in a large body, not
<PB N="91" REF="008163_0089_102E418090E539D0">many miles to the ea&s;tward of that garri&s;on; from whence detach|ments were perpetually &s;ent out to fall upon our workmen, and in|fe&s;t the pa&s;&s;age thro' the Onondaga River. Capt. Brad&s;treet, who had the direction of the battoes, was apprized that &s;mall parties lay in ambu&s;h, waiting a favourable opportunity to attack him. Ac|cordingly, when he left O&s;wego, he ordered the &s;everal divi&s;ions to proceed as near each other as po&s;&s;ible: but &s;o numerous and ir|regular a body could not without difficulty be kept to any tolera|ble order. He was at the head of about 300 battoe-men, in the fir&s;t divi&s;ion, upon his return to Schenectady; and about nine miles from O&s;wego, when the enemy, who were 700 &s;trong, ro&s;e from their ambu&s;cade, and fired upon his front. Near the place of at|tack, was a &s;mall I&s;land, by which the enemy might ea&s;ily have forded the river. Brad&s;treet in an in&s;tant landed upon the i&s;land, to prevent being inclo&s;ed between two fires; and with &s;ix men maintained his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, bravely repelling twenty of the enemy, who attempted to &s;eize that advantageous po&s;t. He was then rein|forced with &s;ix others; and even compelled a &s;econd party of 40 French to give way. Enraged at this &s;hameful di&s;appointment, the enemy, to the number of 70 men, thought proper to make a third attempt; but the battoe-men, who did not exceed 20, with redoubled bravery &s;till kept their ground, and again forced their adver&s;aries to retire. During the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes, which la&s;ted near an hour, the battoe-men in the rear landed, without lo&s;s or confu|&s;ion, upon the &s;outh &s;ide of the river. Four hundred of the enemy now advanced up the north &s;ide of the &s;tream, intending to ford it about a mile higher, and &s;urround us. Brad&s;treet, aware of the de&s;ign, left the i&s;land, and with two hundred men marched on the other &s;ide to oppo&s;e them. But they had actually forded over, be|fore he came up, and po&s;ted them&s;elves in a &s;wamp. Dr. Kirk|land, with the &s;econd divi&s;ion of battoes, was now advancing to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but Brad&s;treet ordered, and Capt. Butler, who com|manded the third divi&s;ion, to keep their po&s;ts, and cover the bat|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s in the rear. Being arrived at the &s;wamp, an engagement en|&s;ued in the Indian manner of fighting and continued above an hour with dubious &s;ucce&s;s. Brad&s;treet, at length animating his men, ru&s;h|ed into the thicket thro' twice his number, and gallantly pu&s;hed them into the river, where many of them peri&s;hed. Another attempt was made, in the mean time, to ford the river a little higher; but tho&s;e being al&s;o repul&s;ed, the whole party was intirely routed and di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="008163_0090_102E41421F8BC670">
JUST after the defeat, Capt. Patten, with his grenadiers from Onondaga, fell in with our battoes; and the next morning a reinforcement of 200 men came up from the garri&s;on, and but for the exce&s;&s;ive rains, which began &s;oon after the action, and continued all the next day, the&s;e brave battoe-men would probably have cut off the whole party. Had Sir William John&s;on, as was expected, accompanied Capt. Patten to O&s;wego, with the In|dians from Onondaga, Brad&s;treet might have made immediate pur&s;uit, and many of the enemy mu&s;t have been overtaken: but this pacific plenipotentiary was then ha&s;tening to Albany (a &s;afe &s;ituation) with the important minutes of his late conference. A conference full of affectionate Indian &s;peeches, and large promi&s;es of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; when &s;carce a man of them could be prevailed upon to turn out of his hut for the defence of the common cau&s;e. Brad&s;treet had but 3 Indians of the Six Nations with him at this attack. Of the&s;e, one took to his heels; a &s;econd fought bravely; but the third went over to the enemy, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in pointing out our officers. In the&s;e &s;everal actions we had about 30 men killed and wounded. How many of the French were &s;lain, is not certainly known; tho' it is generally &s;aid, they lo&s;t about 120. Eighty Arms were brought to Schenectady; and about 70 men found in the woods, and carried to O&s;wego. The French fled in the utmo&s;t di&s;order, and &s;ome of their regular &s;oldiers, being &s;trangers to the country, got bewildered in the de&s;art, and peri&s;hed for want of &s;u&s;tenance.</P>
<P>BRADSTREET arrived at Schenectady on the 11th of July;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brad&s;treet gives in+telligence of the ene|my's de|&s;ign to at|tack O&s;|wego.</NOTE> and the next day acquainted General Abercrombie at Albany of the &s;tate of O&s;wego.&mdash;That he learnt from his pri&s;oners, the French were preparing to attack it, having 1200 men for that purpo&s;e en|camped not far from the ea&s;ternmo&s;t fort.

<P>MR. SHIRLEY arrived at New York on the 4th of July,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Lon|don arri|ves.</NOTE> and waited the arrival of my Lord London, who landed there on the 23d of that month, with Mr. Pownal in his train: but in what character the latter returned a &s;econd time from England, was a &s;ubject of doubtful conjecture.&mdash;His Lord&s;hip, regardle&s;s of his ea&s;e, and the fatigues of a tedious voyage, tarried there but three days; and on the 29th of July reached his head quarters at Albany, when he took upon him&s;elf the command of the army.</P>
<P>THE garri&s;on of O&s;wego con&s;i&s;ted now of 1400 men, and about 300 workmen and &s;ailors. Four hundred and eighty-five were po&s;ted, in &s;mall parties, between that place and Burnet's Field, to maintain an open pa&s;&s;age thro' the country of the Six Nations. The 44th and 48th regiments at Albany and Schenectady, with the Briti&s;h troops ju&s;t arrived, con&s;i&s;ted now of 2600 men; and the provincials, under the command of General Win&s;low, were about 7000, and ready to march from Fort William-Henry.&mdash; Of the naval force of O&s;wego, I have already given your Lord&s;hip an account: and as to the &s;trength of the enemy at Tinonderoge and Crown Point, according to the late&s;t intelligence obtained by Capt.

<P>FROM his Lord&s;hip's known abilities for war,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our pre|&s;ent force, and that of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> the colonies were in great hopes, that notwith&s;tanding the delay of the Briti&s;h rein|forcements, &s;ome coup d'eclat would very &s;peedily be &s;truck at Crown Point. But alas! while we were intent upon this favourite de&s;ign, the enemy were heading their main force, not to oppo&s;e us at Tinonderoge, but to &s;ecure what was to them a matter of much more importance, I mean the exclu&s;ive dominion of the great Lakes&mdash;Accordingly, they laid &s;iege to O&s;wego;

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circum|&s;tances of the &s;iege unknown.</NOTE> and by what numbers, it was taken, or upon what terms &s;urrendered, I cannot give your Lord&s;hip any &s;atis|factory account.

<P>IT is much to be wi&s;hed, my Lord, that Mr. Shirley's advice to General Abercrombie had been followed: and equally to be regretted, that Sir William John&s;on returned with &s;uch precipita|tion from Onondaga to Albany.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">General Webb's march de|layed.</NOTE> To the &s;ame influence, my Lord, it was undoubtedly owing, that General Webb's march, with the 44th regiment from Schenectady, was delayed till the 12th of Augu&s;t, but two days before the garri&s;on was actually &s;urrendered. He had proceeded no farther than Burnet's Field, with his regiment of 900 men, and the remaining 800 battoe-men, when the de&s;erters brought him the news of the &s;iege.

<P>MY LORD,

The enemy, on the other hand, may, without oppo&s;ition or re&s;traint, render the&s;e innumerable tribes of &s;avages their allies and dependants. The Six Nations are more wavering than ever: and &s;hould they no longer think it expedient to pre&s;erve their neu|trality, the whole continent mu&s;t inevitably become a field of blood. Whatever may be thought of the&s;e colonies, which of late have been magnified for their numbers and opulence,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The colo|nies not &s;o power|ful as im|agined.</NOTE> I do a&s;&s;ure your Lord|&s;hip, that a &s;hort war will effectually exhau&s;t them.

<PB N="96" REF="008163_0094_102E41452D6FBAA8">in our political affairs. If I have erred, I am per&s;uaded it is not in any article of importance, nor purpo&s;ely in the minute&s;t. &mdash; E|very line of this letter hath been penned with the mo&s;t &s;acred vene|ration for truth, and a mind equally unbia&s;&s;ed by re&s;entment or affection. &mdash; For obtaining an intimate acquaintance with the mat|ters rehear&s;ed, few in the colonies have had &s;uperior advantages: nor in collecting proper materials, has any one been more a&s;&s;iduous. Add to this, that I had no other intere&s;t in the public mea&s;ures, than the intere&s;t of every man on the continent. I am unconnected with all parties; neither enjoying any po&s;t my&s;elf, nor &s;tanding in the lea&s;t relation to a &s;ingle officer in the army. The love of my country was the &s;ole &s;pring of my curio&s;ity; and &s;o far, indeed, I was not an unconcerned &s;pectator of the publick tran&s;actions. If I have made honourable mention of General Shirley, it was owing to my approbation of his &s;chemes, as conducive to the com|mon-weal of the briti&s;h plantations: and if my judgment was in this regard erronious, I have the plea&s;ure to find my&s;elf in very re&s;pectable company. Except New York, or rather a prevailing faction there, all the colonies hold him in very high e&s;teem. Some have made public declarations of their &s;en&s;e of his great merit; and that too, at a time when he appeared de&s;cending from his meridian of glory. But he needed no other than the te&s;timonials of his own province; for he, my Lord, who&s;e conduct is approved by the people of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay, mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed both for his abilities and his virtue. They are too numerous and wi&s;e to be deceived, too free and independent to be driven. An undue influence can never be obtained by the governor of a colony, who has neither power nor places to be&s;tow. &mdash; Their a&s;&s;emblies are annual &mdash; the members elected by ballot, in number near 200. &mdash; The council, or middle e&s;tate, cho&s;en yearly by the a&s;&s;embly; &mdash; and as all the of|fices are elective, not a man in the province is dependent on the &s;miles or the frowns of the King's repre&s;entative: &mdash; and yet &s;o wi&s;e, free, and loyal a people have approved his judgment; confi|ded in his integrity; te&s;tified in his favour; and publickly lamented his departure from the continent. I would by no means, my Lord, be under&s;tood, by the&s;e favourable &s;entiments of Shirley, to di&s;pa|rage his noble Succe&s;&s;or in the command. He yet has not, at lea&s;t he de&s;erves not to have, a &s;ingle enemy among&s;t us: and I hope it will &s;erve the purpo&s;es of no man to be his enemy. I could only have wi&s;hed, that at this critical juncture, a gentleman &s;o tho|roughly

We have to contend with a &s;ubtle enterpri&s;ing foe&mdash;a foe, rapacious, martial, and bloody, committing murders, rather than waging war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tho' the French colony con|tains perhaps not 30,000 men capable to bear arms; yet the&s;e are all under the de&s;potic command and &s;ole direction of their gover|nor-general; and experience teaches us, that in &s;pite of our navy, they may be annually reinforced. The &s;trength of our colonies, on the other hand, is divided; and the concurrence of all nece&s;|&s;aries both for &s;upplies of men and money. Jealous are they of each other&mdash;&s;ome ill-con&s;tituted&mdash;others &s;haken with inte&s;tine di|vi&s;ions&mdash;and, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, par&s;imonious even to prodigality. Our a&s;&s;emblies are diffident of their gover|nors&mdash;governors de&s;pi&s;e their a&s;&s;emblies, and both mutually mi&s;|repre&s;ent each other to the Court of Great Britain. Military mea|&s;ures demand &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch: but while the colonies remain undivided, and nothing can be tran&s;acted but with their univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to maintain the one, or proceed with the other. Without a general con&s;titution for warlike operations, we can neither plan nor execute. We have a common intere&s;t, and mu&s;t have a common council, <HI>one head,</HI> and <HI>one pur&s;e.</HI> &mdash; The French &s;ervice is unexpo&s;ed to tho&s;e embarra&s;sments; and hence they project without di&s;covery, and we &s;carce collect their de&s;igns, till we are attacked and defeated. Hitherto they have pro&s;ecuted the war with &s;uperior advantage; and yet the militia of the pro|vince of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay alone, undoubtedly exceeds, by &s;ome thou&s;ands, all the troops of Canada. Since the commence|ment of the pre&s;ent ho&s;tilities, his Maje&s;ty has lo&s;t above 3000 loyal &s;ubjects: and as all the Indians are at the devotion of the French, and O&s;wego is now lo&s;t, many thou&s;and farms before the opening of the next &s;pring, will probably be abandoned; and the interior &s;ettlements deluged with the innocent blood of all ages and &s;exes. Indeed, my Lord, 'tis not beneath the mo&s;t elevated &s;tation, to indulge the benevolent feelings of humanity; nor, reti|ring awhile from the pomp and gaiety that &s;urrounds you, to &s;hed a pitying tear over families inhumanly bereft of their &s;ub&s;tance, or more inhumanly &s;loughtered in their beds. &mdash; It is a celebrated &s;aying, and does honour to human nature, <Q>Homo &s;um, et nihil humanum a me alienum puto.</Q></P>

WHAT the pre&s;ent or the next campaign will bring forth, it known only to the Omni&s;cient Governor of the univer&s;e.

I fear the wor&s;t &mdash; and yet you know, my Lord, I am not of a melancholy ca&s;t.

France has been, ever can, and will be annually, throwing over fre&s;h troops into her colony, in defiance of our great maritime force: and &s;hould peace en&s;ue, even before our ruin is compleated, what will be the &s;tate of the&s;e provinces upon the next rupture between the two crowns, when the inland country is filled with our enemies? &mdash; As you therefore value, my noble Lord, the cau&s;e of liberty; the glory of the Briti&s;h name; the honour and dignity of the be&s;t of Kings; and the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e colonies from bloody carnage and total ruin; exert, I be|&s;eech you, exert your influence, to extirpate this brood of French &s;avages from the face of the continent.
