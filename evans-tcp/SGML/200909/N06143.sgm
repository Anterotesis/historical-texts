</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Penman of this P&s;alm is uncertain, but the Occa|&s;ion was doubtle&s;s the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Captivity, in the Time of which, or &s;oon after, it &s;eems to have been com|pos'd.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in their melancholy Exile by the Rivers of <HI>Babylon, Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tygris,</HI> lamented the Lo&s;s of their religious Solemnities; <HI>We wept,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>when we remembred Zion;</HI> there they endured the In&s;ults of their Enemies, in demand|ing Mirth and a Song, of &s;uch who were almo&s;t overwhelmed with Sorrow and Sadne&s;s! but this un&s;ea&s;onable Demand they ju&s;t|ly refu&s;ed to comply with, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;eem to forget the Mi|&s;eries of their Church and Nation, who&s;e Pro&s;perity they preferred to all the other Delights of Life: <HI>If I forget thee, O Jeru&s;alem, let my Right Hand forget her Cunning: If I do not remember thee, let my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth, if I prefer not Jeru&s;alem above my chief Joy!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007799_0004_102D8CE34AD88510">While they reflect upon the Cruelty of the Children of <HI>Edom,</HI> their inveterate Enemies, who in the Day of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>'s Calamity, ur|ged the <HI>Babylonians</HI> to raze it to the Foundation, or to ruin it en|tirely: They are hereby excited, not from a Principle of private Revenge, but from a generous Regard to God's Glory and King|dom, to pray to Jehovah to puni&s;h them: <HI>Remember, O Lord, the Children of Edom:</HI> From the &s;ame pious Principle they are plea&s;ed with the Pro&s;pect of the utter Overthrow of their Con&s;ederates the <HI>Baby|lonians; O Daughter of Babylon, who art to be de&s;troyed;</HI> and pro|nounce a Ble&s;&s;ing upon &s;uch, who &s;hould be In&s;truments of inflict|ing this ju&s;t and righteous Judgment of God upon the Enemies of his Church and People. <HI>Happy &s;hall he be that rewardeth thee as thou ha&s;t &s;erved us;</HI> i. e. It will be to his great Honour and Advantage, who by executing Ju&s;tice and equal Severity upon the unrighteous E|nemies of God's Heritage, is hereby an In&s;trument in the Hand of God to vindicate his Honour, execute his Judgments, fulfil his Word, and relieve his People: Thus it was with <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as both &s;acred and prophane Hi&s;tory witne&s;s, and hence he is call'd God's <HI>Servant,</HI> his <HI>Shepherd,</HI> his <HI>Anointed (I&s;.</HI> 44. <HI>ult.</HI> 45. 1. <HI>I&s;.</HI> 13.3.) and the <HI>Soldiers</HI> which were employ'd in recompen&s;ing upon the afore&s;aid Enemies of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the Deeds which they did to them, are called his <HI>&s;anctified Ones. (I&s;.</HI> 13.3.) From the Words of our Text thus explained, I would ob&s;erve the following Propo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That &s;uch, who in the Cour&s;e of a lawful War, recompence upon the E|nemies of God's Church and People the Injuries they have done to them, are happy Per&s;ons!</HI></P>
<P>In Di&s;cour&s;ing upon this Propo&s;ition, let us,

<P>I return to con&s;ider the</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t propos'd, which was, to <HI>Enquire what Kind of War is law|ful?</HI> In an&s;wer to which it may be ob&s;erved, that there are two
<PB N="5" REF="007799_0005_102D8CE4D9B0C070">
Kinds of War, <HI>viz. Offen&s;ive</HI> and <HI>Defen&s;ive:</HI> The former is an unju&s;t Inva&s;ion of another's Property, from Principles of Ambition and Ava|rice; the Latter, is an Attempt to pre&s;erve or recover our own from the Hands of Violence, or to puni&s;h &s;ome publick Injury, which affects the Credit or Intere&s;t of a Nation or People; this Kind of War, <HI>viz. Defen&s;ive,</HI> when entered into by the &s;upreme Magi&s;trate with due Caution, after pacific Mea&s;ures have been try'd in vain, and is, in the Mean Time, &s;uitably conducted, can|not but be lawful and right, &s;eeing it has Ju&s;tice and Right for its Foundation and Scope, and is the Support, the Execution and De|fence thereof; but <HI>Offen&s;ive</HI> War, being an unju&s;t Inva&s;ion of an|other's Property, is not only different from, but contrary to this, and therefore &s;inful and unju&s;tifiable; a clear View of the Contra|riety of the&s;e Kinds of War, is of great Importance in this Con|trover&s;y, and ca&s;ts a Light upon the whole Argument. I proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">2d propos'd, which was to &s;hew, <HI>whence Defen&s;ive War appears to be lawful or right.</HI> Now this, I think, appears evidently from the Suffrage both of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing that <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> teaches with greater Clearne&s;s, or inculcates with a &s;tronger <HI>Pathes,</HI> than the Excellency and Nece&s;|&s;ity of <HI>commutative Ju&s;tice,</HI> or giving to every one his own: Now &s;eeing the De&s;ign, Nature and Tendency of Defen&s;ive War, is to maintain and di&s;tribute this among Mankind, it mu&s;t therefore of Con&s;equence be good in it&s;elf, when under proper Regulations, &s;o long as there is any intrin&s;ick Excellency in that Virtue on which it is founded, to which it is directed, and of which it is an Executor: He that oppo&s;es this, mu&s;t either &s;ay, that <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> it&s;elf, in its own Nature, is bad, or that it is wrong to do or promote what is good; each of which is equally ab&s;urd, and contrary to the Rea&s;on and Common Sen&s;e of Mankind, as well as ever&s;ive of all Virtue and Religion; tho&s;e therefore that oppo&s;e Defen&s;ive War, will never be able fairly to carry their Point, till they &s;o|lidly prove, that <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> it&s;elf is &s;inful and wicked, which, if I am not much mi&s;taken, is a difficult Task.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007799_0006_102D8CE72A378690">I might here ob&s;erve, that &s;eeing Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive War are Contraries, it therefore follows, That all the Arguments ad|vanced by any again&s;t Offen&s;ive War, do turn virtually and con|&s;equentially in Favour of Defen&s;ive, and are &s;o many Proofs of its Excellency and Nece&s;&s;ity. <HI>E. G.</HI> He that oppo&s;es the Evil of Inju&s;tice, does at the &s;ame Time tacitly recommend its Contrary, whether he will or not, for Contraries can neither be oppos'd or defended together with Rea&s;on and Propriety; the more abomina|ble and dangerous the one is, the more excellent is the other, which is oppos'd to it. So that all the Opponents of War, com|plexly con&s;ider'd, are of Nece&s;&s;ity Patrons of one Kind of it, tho', perhaps, without their Knowledge, or again&s;t their Wills: Now &s;eeing Deceit lurks in Genarals, it is but right that the Oppo&s;ers of War, &s;hould candidly tell us which Kind they are again&s;t, to pre|vent farther Di&s;putes about the Matter: As for our Part, we declare expre&s;ly our Abhorrence of <HI>Offen&s;ive War,</HI> as a great <HI>Iniquity,</HI> and are willing to make this evident, not only by <HI>Words,</HI> but by <HI>Actions,</HI> in labouring by main Force to de&s;troy that <HI>Mon&s;ter,</HI> if milder Mea&s;ures will not an&s;wer the noble End, of introducing the de&s;irable Ble&s;&s;ing of Peace.</P>
<P>Charity would incline me to think, that the Oppo&s;ers of War, mu&s;t mean Offen&s;ive; for &s;urely they wou'dn't knowingly expre&s;s &s;o much Zeal and Invective as is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in this Argument again&s;t <HI>Ju&s;tice:</HI> Well, if the Ca&s;e be &s;o, we have them upon our Side of the Que&s;tion; they are, in Effect, warm Advocates for Defen&s;ive War, and this indeed is no &s;mall Comfort, that our Op|ponents are &s;o friendly in this Debate, we with they would either under&s;tand us or them&s;elves, and join with us in proving by <HI>Fact,</HI> the Reality of their Hatred again&s;t that Abomination that maketh de&s;olate, <HI>Offen&s;ive War:</HI> Their Invectives again&s;t it are ju&s;t and commendable, but in&s;ufficient to de&s;troy it; Words won't kill that <HI>Hydra;</HI> herein therefore they fail, that they don't join with us Heart and Hand, by Force and Arms to cru&s;h that cruel <HI>Cocka|trice!</HI> May it not be hoped that in Time-coming they will better bethink them&s;elves, and act a more con&s;i&s;tent Part; that they will
<PB N="7" REF="007799_0007_102D8CE9C99F0340">
not &s;erve &s;o good a Cau&s;e as pre&s;s'd Men by Con&s;traint, but nobly and openly join as VOLUNTEERS!</P>
<P>But in Addition to the Maxim of Ju&s;tice now mentioned, the Light of Nature teaches every one to pre&s;erve his Life from unju&s;t Violence, by the Principle of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> which is implanted in all, and which, when kept within due Bounds, is good and nece&s;&s;ary, and therefore made by our Lord the Standard of Love to our Neighbour; this Principle di&s;po&s;es us to de&s;ire Life, as well as to fear and &s;hun the Approaches of Death; when we therefore neglect a nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ea&s;onable Self-defence, we are without <HI>natural Affection, Self-haters;</HI> a rare and &s;trange Sort of Mon&s;ters in Na|ture; for <HI>no Man ever hated his own Fle&s;h, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;h|eth it.</HI></P>
<P>Rea&s;on likewi&s;e teaches the Propriety and Nece&s;&s;ity of Self-defence, from the <HI>Capacity</HI> given to this Purpo&s;e, and <HI>Inclination</HI> to exerci&s;e it; Man is endowed with Under&s;tanding and Ability, which the innocent Re&s;entment common to all, urges to exert in oppo&s;ing Violence, and guarding again&s;t the Approaches of Dan|ger: And therefore he that &s;uffers his Life to be taken from him, by one that hath no Authority for that Purpo&s;e, when he might pre&s;erve it by Defence, betrays it, and con&s;equently is guilty of <HI>Self-Murder,</HI> one of the greate&s;t of Crimes!</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the pre&s;ent State of human Nature, to bani&s;h Self-defence, though pro&s;ecuted by Force, would be &s;o far from pro|moting Peace, that it would on the Contrary contribute to the ut|ter <HI>De&s;truction</HI> of Mankind! For Inju&s;tice in this Situation of Things, having no Fear of Puni&s;hment to check its Cour&s;e, would inundate the World, and introduce univer&s;al <HI>Anarchy,</HI> Confu&s;ion and <HI>Ruin:</HI> a melancholy Confirmation of which we have lately had in the defencele&s;s Frontiers of this &s;ecure, unhappy Province!</P>
<P><HI>Sirs,</HI> If it be not lawful and right, to oppo&s;e with Force unju&s;t Invaders, then the Goods of Providence are given to no valuable Purpo&s;e, and the be&s;t of Men are expo&s;ed as an ea&s;y <HI>Prey</HI> to the Wor&s;t, and that by <HI>God</HI>'s own <HI>Order,</HI> which is ab&s;urd! Is it ra|tional to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Law of Nature, which was de&s;igned to pro|mote
<PB N="8" REF="007799_0008_102D880EB6ED89E8">
Man's Safety in this World, &s;hould countenance &s;uch a &s;orry Sort of Peace, as tends to promote the very Contrary? no &s;urely! For this would, in Effect, charge Weakne&s;s and Folly upon God him&s;elf, which to impute to infinite and unerring Wi&s;dom, is a bla&s;phemous Reflection!</P>
<P>Farther, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> give me leave to add, that <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> like|wi&s;e teaches the Nece&s;&s;ity of the <HI>Magi&s;trates Office</HI> in a Communi|ty, to puni&s;h Inju&s;tice, and to protect our Per&s;ons and Properties; now how can the&s;e be done without Force and Arms, in &s;uch a degenerate World as this is? And if either of the&s;e be neglected, what is <HI>Government</HI> but an empty Name, a meer <HI>Cypher,</HI> that, in&s;tead of Honour, de&s;erves <HI>Contempt!</HI> Such a &s;orry Government is much wor&s;e than none a at all; wor&s;e than a State of Nature, be|cau&s;e it binds Mens Hands till they are <HI>robb'd</HI> and <HI>murder'd,</HI> which, otherwi&s;e, they might u&s;e in their own Defence!</P>
<P>Nothing admits of clearer Demon&s;tration, than that Force and Fighting are e&s;&s;ential to the Being and Pre&s;ervation of Civil Go|vernment, in Man's pre&s;ent corrupt State; now, if the Ca&s;e be &s;o, it is the very &s;ame (in all Things material) with Defen&s;ive War, the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of both is the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> Force and Fighting, Blood&s;hed and Death; the <HI>Authority</HI> enjoining both is the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Magi&s;trate, the <HI>End</HI> of both is the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> the Pre&s;ervation of the State; the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> that ea&s;ier Methods will not, at Times, an&s;wer the afore&s;aid Ends: Certainly the Number of <HI>Villains</HI> cannot le&s;&s;on their Crimes, nor have <HI>Rogues</HI> of another Nation any Right to rob and murder us with Impunity more than tho&s;e of our own: Why then &s;hould they not be oppos'd with equal Care and Force?</P>
<P>What is <HI>Civil Government</HI> but the Union of Individuals, for the more effectual Protection of Per&s;on and Property from Inju&s;|tice and Violence? whereby a &s;ufficient Mea&s;ure of Power is, by common Con&s;ent, trea&s;ured up for the Security and Benefit of all the Members of that Body, which is to be exerted to compa&s;s the afore&s;aid important Ends, as the publick Officers of the Society &s;hall direct: And hence it is that Per&s;ons who are wrong'd, or in Danger of being &s;o, rea&s;onably fly to the Officers of the Communi|ty
<PB N="9" REF="007799_0009_102D8CEF06FB8D48">
for Ju&s;tice and Protection, which if they are ab&s;olutely deny'd, or unrea&s;onably <HI>deferred,</HI> beyond the proper Sea&s;on for <HI>Succour,</HI> and many Per&s;ons are in the mean Time <HI>robb'd</HI> and <HI>murder'd,</HI> the principal End of Government is contradicted and de&s;troyed; and the People wrong'd and robb'd of their Right, as <HI>Members</HI> of <HI>Society;</HI> nor will it be ea&s;y to clear &s;uch publick <HI>Officers</HI> (or tho&s;e of them who are acce&s;&s;ary to the afore&s;aid Mea&s;ures) from the Guilt of <HI>Blood!</HI></P>
<P>Now if <HI>Magi&s;tracy</HI> and <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> be the &s;ame in Sub&s;tance, as has been ob&s;erved, it is &s;trange that any &s;hould be ready to ac|cept the one, who &s;cruple the other, as if it was a wicked Thing to put a foreign Criminal to Death, but ju&s;t and good to kill one of our own Country and Nation! Wou'dn't it look more like Candour, Humility and Con&s;i&s;tency, for &s;uch as &s;cruple <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> or deny it, to keep clear of <HI>Offices</HI> in the <HI>Government,</HI> which oblige them, if they will act in Character, to do what is equivalent thereto: Then there would be no Need of <HI>ambiguous, general</HI> and <HI>artful</HI> Terms, po&s;&s;ibly to conceal from vulgar Ob&s;er|vance and Prejudice Practices really contradictory to profe&s;&s;ed Principles; to reconcile &s;uch extraordinary Conduct to <HI>common Candour</HI> and <HI>Sincerity,</HI> is a Task &s;o difficult, that it va&s;tly &s;urpa&s;&s;es the Reach of an ordinary Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am utterly at a Lo&s;s to conceive the Con&s;i&s;tency of Per&s;ons who are principled again&s;t <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> accepting of Offices in the Government, the chief De&s;ign of which is to defend the Community; it is a Contradiction in Terms as well as Matter, a gro&s;s <HI>Ab&s;urdity;</HI> and this is the more unaccountable, when it is done in a Time of publick Danger; for hereby, if Mens profe&s;&s;ed Principles may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any Influence upon their Con|duct, they will be tempted to take wrong Mea&s;ures, or over-&s;low|ly pro&s;ecute tho&s;e that are right; and hereby others are kept from the <HI>Helm</HI> in a Storm, who&s;e Principles would probably lead them to do what is nece&s;&s;ary to the Safety of the State.</P>
<P>Nor is it ea&s;y to clear tho&s;e from the Charge of Incon&s;i&s;tency, and &s;omething wor&s;e, who de&s;ire and expect Protection, and per|haps complain if they have it not, and yet CHUSE into publick Of|fices
<PB N="10" REF="007799_0010_102D8CF0F72F26C8">
tho&s;e who are principled again&s;t it, whether they are not, by the afore&s;aid <HI>Choice,</HI> in &s;ome Degree chargeable with all the un|happy CONSEQUENCES of &s;uch a Government, it is but proper they &s;hould &s;oberly enquire?</P>
<P>The Practice of all Nations, not only of the mo&s;t civilized, but even of the mo&s;t rude and barbarous, who all with one Con|&s;ent have oppos'd Force to Force in their own Defence, from the Beginning of the World to this Time, is no incon&s;iderable Argu|ment to prove that <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> is agreeable to the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> of Mankind; the Denial of it is therefore a Contra|diction to <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and an Affront to <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Yea the very <HI>Bea&s;ts,</HI> by <HI>natural In&s;tinct,</HI> are di&s;po&s;ed to defend them&s;elves, and are provided with Weapons for that Purpo&s;e; it &s;hould therefore be queried, in ca&s;e we make no Re&s;i&s;tance when Nece&s;&s;ity urges, whether we do not act with le&s;s Wi&s;dom than <HI>Pagans,</HI> and with le&s;s Di&s;cretion than <HI>Bea&s;ts?</HI> Now can it be with Rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed, that the <HI>Chri&s;tian In&s;titution,</HI> which was de&s;ign'd to exalt us above the <HI>Angels,</HI> &s;hould, at the &s;ame Time, &s;ink us be|low <HI>Infidels</HI> and <HI>Bea&s;ts?</HI></P>
<P>Having offered &s;ome what re&s;pecting the Suffrage of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> in favour of <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> I proceed to enquire wether <HI>Revelation</HI> in the &s;everal Periods of the Church of God, or Di&s;pen&s;ati|ons of Heaven towards it, does not coroborate and confirm the afore&s;aid <HI>Suffrage?</HI> Here a large Field opens, but the Time allows me to mention only a few Hints.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Patriarchal Age,</HI> I would only offer one In&s;tance, <HI>viz.</HI> That of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the <HI>Friend of God,</HI> and <HI>Father of the Faithful,</HI> he trained up his Servants, in&s;tructed them in the U&s;e of Arms, to prepare them for Action, when Nece&s;&s;ity required; and therefore when he heard that his Brother was taken captive, he arm'd his train'd Servants, &s;mote the Enemy, and pur&s;ued them. It would have been happy for this poor Province, if &s;uch in it who profe&s;s them&s;elves to be the &s;piritual <HI>Children of Abraham,</HI> had followed the Example of the <HI>Father of the Fruthful,</HI> in ha&s;tening to the Relief of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Prote&s;tant Brethern, it would have &s;hown &s;ome <HI>Brotherly Love,</HI> prevented much Blood&s;hed, and given &s;ome Evi|dence
<PB N="11" REF="007799_0011_102D8CF2E7E43C08">
of their <HI>&s;piritual Claim.</HI> Now that the Almighty approved of this memorable Battle of <HI>Abraham,</HI> is evident from <HI>Melchizedek's</HI> congratulating him on Occa&s;ion of his Victory, and likewi&s;e by his ble&s;&s;ing him, and ble&s;&s;ing God on the &s;ame Account, and by his receiving Part of the Spoils, all which would have been ab&s;urd and impious, if the Battle it&s;elf hadn't been lawful. See <HI>Gen.</HI> 14 (18, 19, 20. Ver&s;es.) <HI>And Melchizedek King of Salem, Prie&s;t of the Mo&s;t high God, ble&s;&s;ed him, and &s;aid, Ble&s;&s;ed be Abraham of the Mo&s;t High God, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven and Earth, and Ble&s;&s;ed be the Mo&s;t High God, which hath delivered thine Enemies into thine Hands.</HI> Here ob|&s;erve, that &s;eeing this Battle of <HI>Abraham</HI> was fought before the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Policy and Ceremonies were form'd, was likewi&s;e an im|portant Action, that concern'd the Goods and Lives of Men, and met with the Divine Approbation, <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> mu&s;t there|fore be morally and unalterably good and lawful.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Mo&s;aick Di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> or <HI>Jewi&s;h Oeconomy,</HI> nothing is more evident, than that divers <HI>Wars,</HI> were carry'd on while that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, by various Worthies, with the divine Approbation and Direction; thus devout <HI>Gideon,</HI> a mighty Man of Valour, was commi&s;&s;ioned to fight again&s;t the <HI>Midianites,</HI> and re&s;cue <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from their Tyranny&punc; (<HI>Judges</HI> 6 14 16.) <HI>And the Lord &s;aid, Go in this thy Might, and thou &s;hall &s;ave I&s;rael from the Hand of the Midianites, have I not &s;ent thee! &s;urely I will be with thee, and thou &s;halt &s;lay the Midi|anites as one Man.</HI></P>
<P>Pious <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was al&s;o rais'd up of God, to conduct <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in their Wars, for which he had the divine Pre&s;cription. (<HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 8. 1, 2.) <HI>And the Lord &s;aid unto Jo&s;hua, take all the People of War with thee and ari&s;e go up to Ai, and thou &s;hall do unto Ai and her King, as thou did&s;t to Jericho and her King.</HI></P>
<P>Farther <HI>David,</HI> the <HI>Man after God's own Heart,</HI> was another In|&s;tance of the like Kind, who prai&s;es the Almighty that he had <HI>taught his Hands to war, and his Fingers to fight:</HI> He conducted his Battles according to the expre&s;s Order of God. (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 30.8.) Well &s;eeing <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> was enjoin'd by divine Authority under any Di&s;pen&s;ation, at any pa&s;t Period of Time, it follows nece&s;&s;ari|ly, either that it is in it&s;elf innocent, or that God is the Author of
<PB N="12" REF="007799_0012_102D88158BA487A0">
Sin, by enjoining what is in it&s;elf &s;inful: But the latter is bla&s;phe|mous, and therefore the Former is mo&s;t certainly true; <HI>viz. That Defen&s;ive War is in it&s;elf innocent and good,</HI> and, if &s;o, becomes a Duty, when Providence calls to it by the Nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs, and the Magi&s;trates Order: Why therefore &s;hould an innocent Thing be dre&s;s'd up in Bears-skins and a <HI>Huc-and-Cry</HI> rais'd again&s;t it? Is this fair or rea&s;onable?</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> or <HI>New Te&s;tament Di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> there are divers In&s;tances which &s;ufficiently confirm the Point in View. E. G. When the Soldiers ask'd <HI>John the Bapti&s;t, what they &s;hould do?</HI> he did not direct them to lay a&s;ide their <HI>military Employment,</HI> but to <HI>be content with their Wages:</HI> Which &s;uppo&s;es his Approbation, of the Bu&s;ine&s;s they were engaged in, and implies an Encouragement to continue in it; it cannot be with Rea&s;on imagined, that this in&s;pi|red Per&s;on, would give In&s;truction how to conduct an Employ|ment ob&s;olutely &s;inful; for that would be to give Direction how to commit Iniquity, which is ab&s;urd! No, if he had judged that Manner of Life to be &s;inful, he would have &s;aid &s;o; for indeed he had not only an Opportunity, but a proper Call to this Pur|po&s;e, in An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion propo&s;ed to him; nor was he ever known to mince the Matter.</P>
<P>Farther, The&s;e Words of our Lord, recorded <HI>John</HI> 18.36. do expre&s;ly declare his Approbation of <HI>Defen&s;ive War; If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight, that I &s;hould not be deli|vered to the Jews.</HI> Here the Redeemer &s;ignifies that temporal Kingdoms &s;hould be protected by <HI>Fighting</HI> or by <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Force.</HI></P>
<P>Of the like Tendency is the following Declaration of Chri&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Matthew,</HI> Chap. 24, and 43d Ver&s;e, <HI>But know this, that if the good Man of the Hou&s;e had known in what Watch the Thief would come, he would have watched, and not &s;uffered his Hou&s;e to be broken up.</HI></P>
<P>This our Lord &s;peaks of with Approbation, and therefore here|by teaches the Lawfulne&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of oppo&s;ing Robbers by Force, and of preparing for this Oppo&s;ition: <HI>The good Man would have watched, and would not have &s;uffered.</HI> Well, if we &s;hould re&s;i&s;t one Robber, much more many, becau&s;e the Danger is greater;
<PB N="13" REF="007799_0013_102D8CF6F4513BF8">
and if we &s;hould re&s;i&s;t Robbers, when they only attempt to take away our Goods, much more when they attack our Lives, which are of more Importance.</P>
<P>Another memorable Pa&s;&s;age of our Saviour to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, is that directed to the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter, Mat.</HI> 26.53, 54. <HI>Thinke&s;t thou that I cannot pray to my Father, and he &s;hall pre&s;ently give me more than</HI> 12 <HI>Legions of Angels; but how then &s;hall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it mu&s;t be.</HI> The Meaning of which is plainly this, that Chri&s;t mu&s;t die for the Sins of his People according to the Scriptures, and therefore the U&s;e of Force to protect his Life in this extraordinary Situation, was unnece&s;&s;ary and incon&s;i&s;tent; but that if the Ca&s;e had been otherwi&s;e, he would have us'd a military Force for his Protection again&s;t unju&s;t Violence. Our Lord &s;peaks of the <HI>An|gels</HI> as <HI>military Troops,</HI> and &s;ignifies that on Suppo&s;ition his Ca&s;e was ordinary, and he attack'd by the Hand of Violence, he would u&s;e Means to obtain an <HI>arm'd Force</HI> for his Protection; and did not the great Doctor of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> who well knew the Mind of his Ma&s;ter and Lord, actually do this, when a Con&s;piracy was form'd by the <HI>Jews</HI> again&s;t his Life: (See <HI>Acts</HI> the 23d Chap.) I hope then there is no Harm in following our Lord and his chief Apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>Here it may be farther ob&s;erved, re&s;pecting the la&s;t In&s;tance, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> before he apply'd for a Military Force to pro|tect him, had the po&s;&s;itive Promi&s;e of God that he &s;hou'd preach the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t at <HI>Rome,</HI> and con&s;equently be protected from the pre&s;ent Combination again&s;t his Life (<HI>Acts</HI> 23.11.) in which Promi&s;e he doubtle&s;s tru&s;ted, yet notwith&s;tanding he tho't it nece&s;|&s;ary to u&s;e the proper outward Mean for his Defence, <HI>viz.</HI> an arm'd Force; this plainly &s;hews the Con&s;i&s;tency thereof with the Pro|mi&s;e of God, and a Dependance on him.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould the&s;e Words of our Saviour be overlook'd, <HI>are ye come out again&s;t me as again&s;t a Thief with Swords and with Staffs;</HI> here the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us &s;ignifies his Approbation of the U&s;e of <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Force</HI> again&s;t a <HI>Thief</HI> to bring him to Ju&s;tice, well if in the Judg|ment of Chri&s;t, this be lawful and nece&s;&s;ary again&s;t one; it is
<PB N="14" REF="007799_0014_102D8CF9225F7FE0">
much more &s;o again&s;t many: Nor is there any good Rea&s;on why we &s;hou'd be more tender of <HI>Foreign,</HI> than Dome&s;tick <HI>Thieves.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Centurion</HI> or <HI>Roman Captain</HI> addre&s;s'd our Saviour on Account of his &s;ick Servant, and us'd his Military Office as an Argument to obtain his Reque&s;t, our Lord granted the Petition infere'd by that Argument, and commended the Faith encourag'd by it: which con&s;idering the Call the Redeemer then had to de|clare his Mind in Relation to <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> fairly imply his A|probation of it.</P>
<P>If <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> be &s;inful, then to what purpo&s;e or with what con&s;i&s;tency did our Lord command every one of his Di&s;ciples, that had <HI>no Sword, to &s;ell his Garment and buy one, (Luke</HI> 22.39.) and why is <HI>Cornelius</HI> Captain of the <HI>Italian</HI> Company &s;o highly honour'd by Heaven and Earth, and adorn'd with the mo&s;t amiable Charac|ter, of being <HI>a devout Man, and one that fear'd God with all his Hou&s;e,</HI> which <HI>gave much Alms to the People, and pray'd to God always;</HI> and in the mean Time no <HI>Cen&s;ure</HI> pa&s;t upon his military Office by an in&s;pir'd Apo&s;tle, &s;ent for by divine Direction, to inform him of his Duty, and that under the expre&s;s <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of an <HI>Angel,</HI> that &s;aid Apo&s;tle &s;hou'd tell him what he ought to do&punc; from this In|&s;tance therefore, one of two Things nece&s;&s;arily follows, either that the Angel's Promi&s;e fail'd, or that <HI>Cornelius</HI> ought not to de&s;ert his military Station, but the former is impo&s;&s;ible, and there|fore the latter is true, and thus the labouring Point is gain'd, <HI>that Defen&s;ive War is lawful.</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> &s;peaks with Honour and Approbation of the Bravery and martial Exploits of divers antient Heroes, who <HI>through Faith &s;ubdued Kingdoms, waxed valiant in Fight, and put to Flight the Armies of Aliens</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here ob&s;erve, that War and Fighting in a good Cau&s;e is &s;o far from being contrary to Faith, that they are Fruit of it. Tho&s;e therefore who in&s;tead of bringing forth this Fruit condemn &s;uch as do, &s;hou'd enquire how they will prove their Faith to be of the &s;ame kind with that of <HI>David, Samuel</HI> and the <HI>Pro|phets.</HI> Hebrews. 11.32, 33.</NOTE>: And in diver&s;s other Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, God him&s;elf who is the be&s;t Judge of Truth, Excellency and Worth, &s;peaks with Honour of

military Bravery, and hence the Per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;'d of it are call'd <HI>mighty Men of Valour,</HI> it is therefore a &s;orry Sort of Go&s;pel, that con|tradicts the Judgment of God him&s;elf and his in&s;pir'd Servants; that CASHIERS from the Catalogue of Virtues, <HI>Fortitude and military Bravery,</HI> which are &s;o noble in them&s;elves and nece&s;&s;ary to the publick <HI>Weal,</HI> and Dubs in their room either &s;ordid Coward|ice, or &s;tupid Negligence, or rather both together, which are as ba&s;e in them&s;elves, as pernicious and de&s;tructive to Society. Unrea&s;onable and abominable is that pretended Chri&s;tianity, which directs us to take more Care for the Support of our Bodies, than the Protection of our <HI>Lives,</HI> which our <HI>Lord</HI> tells us are <HI>better than Food and Rayment.</HI> If &s;ome have been protected in Dangers miraculou&s;ly, &s;o others have been fed in like man|ner, well, &s;eeing the Ca&s;es are Parallel, why will not &s;uch who expect Protection without the U&s;e of Arms, try whether they can live without Food, a little Trial of this, if we cou'd but per&s;uade them to it, would &s;oon convince them of the Folly of their Faith, or rather Pre&s;umption, and be of more Service than many Arguments. But to preced,</P>
<P>Give me leave farther to ob&s;erve, that the Argument before us'd of the MAGISTRACY in Favour of <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> from Rea&s;on, is con|firm'd by Revelation, and that not only in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> but the <HI>New:</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in his <HI>Epi&s;tle to the Romans,</HI> ob&s;erves, that <HI>the Magi&s;trate is a Mini&s;ter of God, to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil, and &s;hou'd not bear the Sword in vain,</HI> and el&s;ewhere Go|vernors are &s;aid to be &s;ent for <HI>the Puni&s;hment of evil Doors, and Prai&s;e of tho&s;e that do well, that under them we may live peaceable and quiet Lives, in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty;</HI> and hence we are told, that <HI>he that &s;heds Man's Blood, by Man &s;hall his Blood be &s;hed;</HI> we are likewi&s;e enjoin'd to <HI>give Tribute to Ce&s;ar,</HI> and to <HI>be Subject to the higher Powers,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>there is no Power but of God:</HI> Well, if Government be a Divine In&s;titution, and <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Fighting</HI> are e&s;|&s;ential to it, as both Rea&s;on and Revelation a&s;&s;ure us, then &s;uch as oppo&s;e <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> if they will be con&s;i&s;tent with them|&s;elves, mu&s;t al&s;o oppo&s;e all civil Order and Government upon the Earth, which if put in Practice wou'd &s;oon open &s;uch a Scene

He that killeth with the Sword, mu&s;t be kill'd with the Sword, here is the Faith and Patience of the Saints,</HI> &s;aith the Scrip|tures, Rev. 13.16.</P>
<P>Once more, if we mu&s;t without Oppo&s;ition, tamely and &s;ordid|ly &s;uffer all that is dear to us, as Men and Chri&s;tians, to be made an ea&s;y Prey of by our unrighteous and implacable Ene|mies, then we are in a wor&s;e Condition under the Go&s;pel than ever Mankind were in before it; then the la&s;t, the brighte&s;t and mo&s;t gracious Di&s;pen&s;ation of God towards Men, in&s;tead of en|larging our Priveleges as it profe&s;&s;es, has over&s;et them all at one <HI>Stroke,</HI> and left us in a State of the mo&s;t abject Slavery, and dreadful <HI>Va&s;&s;alage</HI> to the Lu&s;ts of every Invader, which is con|trary to the Truth of the Scriptures, and to the Wi&s;dom and Good|ne&s;s of God, as well as entirely ever&s;ive of all human Happi|ne&s;s in this Life<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I might here add to the <HI>Suffrage</HI> of Rea&s;on and Revelation, that of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Church,</HI> the primitive Fathers of which declared their Sentinents in Favour of Defen&s;ive War, witne&s;s <HI>Clement, Clemens Alexandrinus, Irenius, Origen, Tertullian, Minutius Felix, Cyprian, Chri&s;o&s;tom, Nazarius, Ba&s;il, Augu&s;tine, Am|bro&s;e, Cyril, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory Ni&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> and others, but not only particular Fathers; but whole Councils have &s;ignified various Ways their Approbation of Defen&s;ive War; they therefore made it a po&s;itive Rule and Con&s;titution among them, that Soldiers of a &s;ober Life, &s;hould be admitted to Church Member&s;hip their Words are the&s;e, <Q>Let a Soldier that de&s;ires to be baptized, be exhorted to ab&s;tain from Wrongs and Oppre&s;&s;ions, and to be content with his Pay; if he complies with the&s;e, let him be admitted.</Q> See <HI>Con&s;titu.

Any Pa&s;&s;ages in the Writings of the Antients, of a dif|ferent Appearance at fir&s;t View, upon Examination will be found only to &s;ignify either their Aver&s;ion to the Method of propagating Religion by Force, or of re&s;i&s;ting the lawful Government under which they liv'd, or the Un&s;uitable|ne&s;s of the Clergies bearing Arms, or of Chri&s;tians engaging in War when idolatrous or other &s;inful Terms, were impos'd.

<P>Beware, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> of a narrow, bitter <HI>Party-Spirit,</HI> &s;light not each other becau&s;e of different Sentiments in Religion or Poli|ticks, for &s;uch a Diver&s;ity is unavoidable in the pre&s;ent State of Imperfection: However you may differ in other Matters, yet agree in this common and noble Cau&s;e, <HI>the Defence of your Country,</HI> and the rather becau&s;e by its excellent Con&s;titution, it maintains your <HI>Religious Liberty</HI> inviolate!</P>
<P>O pre&s;erve the Union of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> among your&s;elves, without this your military A&s;&s;ociations are neither like to be ho|nourable or comfortable to your&s;elves, or &s;erviceable to your Country; and &s;eeing your Companies are not formed by the Con|&s;traint of Authority, but by your own Choice, and have no Pro&s;|pect of private Intere&s;t to encourage their Continuance; there is of Con&s;equence the greater Need of the afore&s;aid Union, without which they are not like to be of long Duration.</P>
<P>But I proceed to offer a few Words to &s;uch of the Inhabitants of this City, who have not hitherto join'd in the late <HI>A&s;&s;ociations for Defence,</HI> or <HI>military Companies: My Friends and Brethren,</HI> when any, in a Time of publick Danger and Di&s;tre&s;s, freely and voluntarily of their own Motion, <HI>offer them&s;elves</HI> to defend their Country by <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Arms,</HI> and avenge its Wrongs, it furni&s;hes &s;ufficient Matter for Thankfulne&s;s and Prai&s;e to Almighty God, who has &s;tirr'd them up thereto, and gives great Plea&s;ure and Delight to &s;uch as have their Country's Good at Heart; but the Enemies of our Religion and Liberty are griev'd at &s;uch a Sight. (See <HI>Judges</HI> 5. 2. 9. And <HI>Nehemiah</HI> 2.10, 19, 20.) <HI>Prai&s;e ye the Lord for the avenging of I&s;rael, when the People, willingly offered them&s;elves; my Heart is towards the Governors of I&s;rael, that offered them&s;elves willingly among the People, ble&s;s ye the Lord! When Sanballet the Horonite, and Tobiah, the Servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it griev'd them exceedingly, that there was come a Man to &s;eek the Welfare of the Children of I&s;rael: Then &s;aid I unto them, Ye &s;ee the Di&s;tre&s;s that we are in, how Jeru&s;alem lyeth

<P><HI>Sirs,</HI> It is exceeding agreeable to devout Minds, and God &s;hou'd be acknowledged for it, when not only Per&s;ons of a lower Order, but tho&s;e of the highe&s;t, are VOLUNTEERS in the Cau&s;e of their God and their Country, and appear in Arms in Defence thereof, altho' they might plead Excu&s;e becau&s;e of their Dignity; <HI>My Heart is to|wards the Governors of I&s;rael, that offer'd them&s;elves willingly among the People;</HI> As if the gallant in&s;pir'd Heroine <HI>Deborah</HI> had &s;aid, I high|ly e&s;teem and heartily love tho&s;e brave <HI>Patriots,</HI> who do not in&s;i&s;t upon the little Punctillio's of their Honour, when all their religi|ous and civil Privileges are at Stake; no, great Souls, in &s;uch important Conjunctures, treat &s;uch Trifles with a noble Negligence; &s;urely tho&s;e Eagles will not meanly drop their &s;ublime Flight, to catch Flies, nor fooli&s;hly lo&s;e the Sub&s;tance by gra&s;ping at a Shadow!</P>
<P>I would therefore entreat you, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> to encourage the&s;e <HI>military Companies,</HI> by joining in them, and punctually attending the Times of their Exerci&s;es, as well as by ble&s;&s;ing God for them, and imploring his Ble&s;&s;ing upon them!</P>
