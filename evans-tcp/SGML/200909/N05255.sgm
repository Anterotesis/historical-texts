<HEAD>A Continuation of the Calm and Di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Vin|dication, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>DISPUNTING on Points on Religion would be one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant as well as profita|ble Entertainments of this imperfect State, if tho&s;e who engage in Controver&s;y would be but careful to maintain that good Nature and Cha|rity, that benevolent and kind Regard to their Antago|ni&s;ts, which Chri&s;tianity obliges us to &s;how towards all Men: If a &s;incere Zeal for Truth, and a fervent Love to one another did direct and animate our Enquiries and Di&s;qui&s;itions, they would certainly bring us nearer to one another in our Sentiments, if not cau&s;e us all to think and &s;peak the &s;ame Things.</P>
<P>But if, in&s;tead of offering the Rea&s;ons of our Opini|ons with Meekne&s;s, and &s;peaking the Truth in Love, we u&s;e the mo&s;t provoking and in&s;ulting Language we can invent, and rake every Dunghill to find Scandal to fling at our Adver&s;aries, and care not whether it be true or fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">, &s;o it be but &s;piteful and di&s;graceful, if in&s;tead of rectifying their Mi&s;takes we try to bla&s;t the Reputation of tho&s;e who differ from us, and repre&s;ent them as hateful and ridiculous, as Men of no Con&s;cience or Rea&s;on, and &s;train their Expre&s;&s;ions to &s;uch an ill Sen&s;e as was never intended; though this kind of managing Controver&s;y may make Sport for Fools, yet it mu&s;t needs do a World of Mi&s;chief by <HI>&s;ouring</HI> Men's Tempers,
<PB N="6" REF="006637_0005_10297199DF367698">and propagating Malice and Ill Nature, which is the very Temper of the Devils; and &s;o making Men much more the Children of Hell, than they would be, if they did remain ignorant of the Truth in Conte&s;t.</P>
<P>We never have more need to remember the Com|mand of our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, to <HI>love our Enemies, and to ble&s;s them that cur&s;e us,</HI> than while we are engaged with &s;uch an unfair Di&s;putant, e&s;pecially if his Malice and Fal&s;hood be ma&s;ked with <HI>Saint&s;hip</HI> and a pretended Zeal for <HI>Piety.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has the Advantage of me both as to his Matter and Manner of Writing; his Bu|&s;ine&s;s is to load us with Reproaches, and once in a while to &s;hew the Sprightline&s;s of his Wit by breaking of a bitter Je&s;t upon us: And it is an old Ob&s;ervation, that Satyrs are more eagerly entertained, and read with more Applau&s;e than Vindications. And the <HI>Spectator</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>Ill Nature among ordinary Ob&s;erves, pa&s;&s;es for Wit. A &s;piteful Saying gratifies &s;o many little Pa&s;&s;ions in tho&s;e who hear it, that it generally meets with a good Reception. The Laugh ri&s;es upon it, and the Man who uttered it, is looked upon as a &s;hrew'd Sa|tyri&s;t.</Q> But I am &s;o near to that World in which all are <HI>&s;erious,</HI> that I &s;hall leave him in the quiet Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of that &s;ort of Arguments. I &s;hall likewi&s;e over|look mo&s;t of his per&s;onal Reflections, and <HI>cruel Mockings,</HI> which his Friend Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>are as really Per&s;e|cution as Bonds and Impri&s;onments,</HI> P. 168. And &s;hall directly come to the Point in Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The Controver&s;y lies chiefly in the&s;e three Points.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Whether there can be any true Mini&s;ters of JESUS CHRIST without a Succe&s;&s;ion?</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Whether the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Church of <HI>England</HI> has ever been broken?</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="7" REF="006637_0006_1029719B64FADBA0">
III. Whether the the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Mini&s;ters in <HI>New-En|gland</HI> have Authority from CHRIST by Succe&s;&s;ions?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To begin with the fir&s;t of the&s;e, when I &s;ay, that there can't be a <HI>lawful</HI> Mini&s;ter without an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion; I mean, that in order to a Man's being a <HI>lawful</HI> Mini&s;ter, he mu&s;t be ordained or appointed to that Office by &s;ome Men who have received Authority to ordain, and they who have not received &s;uch Author|rity, can not con&s;titute and Emba&s;&s;ador of Chri&s;t; and this Authority to ordain &s;ince the Apo&s;tles Time, is not immediately from Heaven, but by Men. And it is not material whether the Ordainers be called Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, Deacons, or by any other Name, if they have had the Power of Ordination committed to them it is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>To prove this I cited Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s Rea&s;oning, which I e&s;teem as clear a Demon&s;tration as &s;uch Truths are capable of; who &s;ays thus "If there be no Succe&s;&s;ion of Per&s;on authorized from CHRIST to &s;end others to act in his Name, then both <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Preachers are equally <HI>U&s;urpers,</HI> and as mere Lay-Men as any at all. For there can't be any other Difference between the Clergy and Laity, but as the one hath Authority derived from CHRIST, to perform Offices, which the other hath not. But this Authority can be no otherwi&s;e had, than by an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of Men from CHRIST, impower'd to qualify others. For if the Succe&s;&s;ion be once broke, People mu&s;t either go into the Mini&s;try of their own Accord, or be &s;ent by &s;uch as have no more Power to &s;end others than to go them&s;elves. And can the&s;e be called Mi|ni&s;ters of CHRIST, or received as his Amba&s;&s;adors? Can they be thought to act in his Name, who have no Authority from him? If &s;o, then <HI>every chri&s;tian Slave,</HI> may ordain to as good Purpo&s;e as the be&s;t <HI>Bi&s;hop in Old England or New.</HI> For it can only be objected to &s;uch Actions, that they had no Authority
<PB N="8" REF="006637_0007_1029719E5E3542D8">from CHRIST. And if there be no Succe&s;&s;ion of Or|dainers from CHRIST, every one is equally qualified to ordain. &mdash; The Admini&s;tring a Sacrament is an Action we have no Right to perform, con&s;idered ei|ther as Men, Gentlemen, or Scholars, or Members of the civil Society. Who then can have any Autho|rity to interpo&s;e, but he that has it from CHRIST? And how that can be had from him, without a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Men from him, is not ea&s;ily conceived. Should a private Per&s;on choo&s;e a Lord <HI>Chancellor,</HI> and declare his Authority good; would there be any Thing but Ab&s;urdity, Impudence and Pre&s;umption in it? But why he cannot as well Commi&s;&s;ion a Per|&s;on to act, &s;ign and &s;eal in the King's Name, as in the Name of CHRIST, is unaccountable.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of CHRIST are as much po&s;itive Ordi|nances as the Sacraments, and we might as well think, that Sacraments no in&s;tituted by him, might be means of Grace, as tho&s;e pa&s;t for his Mini&s;ters, who have no Authority from him.</P>
<P>Once more, all Things are either in Common in the Church of CHRIST, or they are not: if they are, then every one may Preach, Baptize, Ordain, &amp;c. If all Things are not thus common, but the admini&s;tring the Sacraments and Ordination, &amp;c. are Offices appropri|ated to particular Per&s;ons, then I de&s;ire to know, how, in the pre&s;ent Age, or any other &s;ince the Apo&s;tles, Chri&s;tians can know their re&s;pective Duties, or what they may or may not do, with re&s;pect to the &s;everal Acts of Church Communion, if there be no uninter|rupted Succe&s;&s;ion of Per&s;ons authorized from CHRIST? For till Authority from CHRIST appears to make a Difference between them, we are all alike, and any one may o&s;&s;iciate as well as another. Therefore to make a Je&s;t of the uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion, is to make a Je&s;t of Ordiantion, to de&s;troy the &s;acred Cha|racter, and to make all Pretenders to it, as good as tho&s;e who are &s;ent by CHRIST.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006637_0008_1029719FE55017F0">
Now what An&s;wer has Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> returned to this Rea&s;oning? Alas, he has pa&s;t it over in profound Si|lence. But why was this Neglect? Certainly it could not be an over&s;ight, for it was the fir&s;t Argument that &s;tared him in the Face. Neither was it for want of Time or Paper, for after above a Year of Preparation, he has &s;ent us a large Piece of 172 Pages, pretending that it is an An&s;wer to our Rea&s;ons for our not being Di&s;&s;enters; and yet the mo&s;t material are entirely overlook'd. Or la&s;tly, did he think this Rea&s;oning to be too weak and childi&s;h for him to take Notice of it? No, &s;urely, for the weaker he accounts any Part of our Di&s;cour&s;e, the more he labour to expo&s;e it to Con|tempt. It remains therefore that the only Rea&s;on mu&s;t be, that he knew it was unan&s;werable: and there|fore the wi&s;e&s;t Cour&s;e was to pa&s;s by it in Silence; in which Manner he has treated mo&s;t of our Arguments. But if he had an&s;wered this one &s;ingle Argument ef|fectually, it would have been of infinitely more Value than all his great Book without it. Had he cleared up but this one Point, and &s;hewed how a Man who has no Authority from CHRIST, can con&s;tituted a true Am|ba&s;&s;ador for him, I would have returned him my hearty Thanks, and have joined immediately with the Di&s;&s;en|ters, although I believe they have no <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> from CHRIST. But to be <HI>pe&s;tered</HI> and <HI>tea&s;ed</HI> from Time to Time with long and virulent <HI>Addre&s;&s;es,</HI> urging us to become Di&s;&s;enters with &s;uch vehement Importunity, as though all we are worth to Eternity, as well as the Salvation of the Heathen World did depend upon it; and yet at the &s;ame Time not to afford one faint Endeavour to remove the Ob&s;tacle out of the Way; really Mr. <HI>Hobart,</HI> this looks a little di&s;ingenuous. Indeed, I blame no Man for not doing Impo&s;&s;ibilites, as this is: I only blame him for boa&s;ting &s;o often that he had confuted us, when he knew, that our chief Arguments not only remained untouched, but were really unan&s;werable. But though he cannot an&s;wer our plain Rea&s;ons for the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Succe&s;&s;ion, yet he thinks to bear us down
<PB N="10" REF="006637_0009_102971A459D075A0">by Authorities. Whereas I mu&s;t let him know, that ten Thou&s;and Authorities in Matters of Religion are not equivalent to one plain Rea&s;on. And it will not excu&s;e my living in Error and Sin, to &s;ay, it was agreeable to the Opinion of &s;uch a Divine, or &s;uch a Church. Rea|&s;on is the Birth Right of every Man, for the u&s;ing of which he mu&s;t be be accountable to the Author of it.</P>
<P>However we will allow the Opinion of others its proper Weight and Influence. The fir&s;t Authority he cites, is Article XXIII, of the Churh of <HI>England,</HI> which runs thus, <Q>It is not lawful for any Man to take upon him the Office of publick Preaching, or mini&s;tering the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he be law|fully called and &s;ent to execute the &s;ame. And tho&s;e we ought to judge lawfully called and &s;ent, which be cho&s;en and called to this Work by Men who have publick Authority given into the Lord's Vineyard.</Q></P>
<P>You will now ea&s;ily perceive that this Article a&s;&s;erts the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Succe&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame Sen&s;e as I have done, if you ob&s;erve, that the World <HI>Congregation,</HI> when the&s;e Articles were compo&s;ed, was u&s;ed in a dif|ferent Sen&s;e from what is annext to it at this Day. A <HI>Congregation</HI> now denotes a Number of Chri&s;tians who can meet to Wor&s;hip in one Place, but in the&s;e Arti|cles it &s;ignifies the whole Catholick Church di&s;per&s;ed all over the Earth; as you may &s;ee in Article XIX, where the Catholick Church is thus defined, <Q>The vi|&s;ible Church of CHRIST is a Congregation of faith|ful Men, &amp;c.</Q> Now, &s;ays this Article, none are to be accounted lawful Mini&s;ters unle&s;s they have had an Ordination by &s;uch Men as have received an outward Commi&s;&s;ion or Authority in the Church, impowering them to call and &s;end others. And he who is or|dained by &s;uch Men, who never had publick Authority committed unto them in the Church, to call and &s;end Mini&s;ters into the LORD's Vineyard, he is no lawful Mini&s;ter. From hence it follows, that where there
<PB N="11" REF="006637_0010_102971A8CB4E68C0">is no Succe&s;&s;ion, there is no lawful Mini&s;ter, and where the Ordainers never received Authority to call and &s;end others, there the Ordination is a <HI>Nullity.</HI> Thus, if the Bi&s;hop who ordained me had received no Authority to ordain, then I am no lawful Mi|ni&s;ter, and the &s;ame is true of him, if his Ordainers had not received publick Authority, and the &s;ame holds true in all Ages. So that the Line of Succe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t reach up to the Apo&s;tles, otherwi&s;e there can be no lawful Mini&s;try. So that according to this Article, the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> or <HI>Independent</HI> Mini&s;ters of <HI>New-England</HI> are no lawful Mini&s;ters, for that Set of <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> who &s;eparated from the Church of <HI>England</HI> and ordained them, never had received <HI>publick Authority in the Church</HI> to ordain or &s;end others; whatever Authority they u&s;ed, it was <HI>a&s;&s;umed</HI> or &s;tolen, no &s;uch publick Autho|rity was ever committed to them. The&s;e Mini&s;ters therefore <HI>entred not in by the Door, but climbed up another Way.</HI> How unlucky was Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> in producing this Article for Proof, that a Succe&s;&s;ion is unnece&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P>His next Evidence is Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> P. 57. who &s;ays, <Q>I do not find any one of the antient Fathers that makes the local, per&s;onal, vi&s;ible and a continued Succe&s;&s;i|on, a nece&s;&s;ary Sign or Mark of the true Church in any one Place.</Q></P>
<P>But pray, what Succe&s;&s;ion is this, which he &s;ays is not nece&s;&s;ary? Is it a Succe&s;&s;ion in the Chri&s;tian Prie&s;t|hood or Mini&s;try? No certainly: but a <HI>local, per&s;onal, vi&s;ible, continued</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion of the Church, i. e. in one Place: This, be &s;ays, is not nece&s;&s;ary, or a Mark of its being true. Thus, altho' there has not been a vi|&s;ible continued Succe&s;&s;ion of what we call a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Church in <HI>England</HI> in the Times of Popery, yet that is no certain Mark of Sign that this Prote&s;tant Church is not a true Church. This, I &s;uppo&s;e was in An&s;wer to the Papi&s;ts, who ince&s;&s;antly demand, Where was your Prote&s;tant Church before <HI>Luther?</HI> But how im|pertinent was this to the Ca&s;e before us? Dare Mr. <HI>Hobart &s;ay,</HI> that Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> was of Opinion that
<PB N="12" REF="006637_0011_102971AA502A7550">the apo&s;tolick or mini&s;terial Authority was lo&s;t in <HI>En|gland</HI> in the Times of Popery? Had he taught &s;uch Doctrine as this, I dare &s;ay, the <HI>Red hot Zealots</HI> would not have cut off his Head for his Popery: nor would Mr. <HI>Neal,</HI> and other Di&s;&s;enters at this Day &s;peak of him as being more than a <HI>Devil.</HI> Surely he was hard put to it, to find Evidences, otherwi&s;e he would not have produced &s;uch impertinent ones as the&s;e, and put them in <HI>Capitals.</HI></P>
<P>It is difficult to bring all his Evidences together, they being &s;cattered here and there at a great Di&s;tance. But I think there is but one more, P. 78. He cites Bi&s;hop <HI>Hoadly,</HI> &s;aying, <Q><HI>This regular uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of Per&s;ons, qualified and regularly ordained,</HI> is a Matter im|po&s;&s;ible to be proved, &amp;c. And there is <HI>a Certainty that this Succe&s;&s;ion hath often been interrupted.</HI></Q> In an&s;wer to which I would ob&s;erve, his Lord&s;hip u&s;es the Words, <HI>This regular uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> in the Sen&s;e of the <HI>Non-Jurors,</HI> again&s;t whom he was writing: and there|fore this Evidence is nothing to the Purpo&s;e. We hold the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Succe&s;&s;ion in no other Sen&s;e than is expre&s;t in Article xxiii. of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> that is, that they who ordain others mu&s;t have Authority to do it, otherwi&s;e the Ordained are not lawful Mini&s;ters: Whereas this Regular Succe&s;&s;ion which the Non-Jurors contended for is broken, when &s;ome Bi&s;hops are de|prived by the Civil Government, altho' they who &s;uc|ceed them are ordained by Men who have publick Au|thority &s;o to do. Now this <HI>Regular Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> (&s;o cal|led by the Non-Jurors) I freely own is not nece&s;&s;ary; nay, it is certain, it has been interrupted in &s;everal In|&s;tances. But then the&s;e Interruptions (&s;o called) have not at all impaired the Apo&s;tolick Authority which is continued &s;till by Ordinations performed by true Bi|&s;hops. In other Words, a Breach in the Non-Jurors <HI>Regular Succe&s;&s;ions,</HI> is no Breach at all in the real Mini|&s;terial Succe&s;&s;ion by Ordination, which we believe to be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But if his Lord&s;hip really meant, (as I believe he did
<PB N="13" REF="006637_0012_102971AD4BCDD1F0">not) that they who ordain others, may convey valid Orders, although they them&s;elves have no Authority to ordain; then I mu&s;t beg leave to di&s;&s;ent, and reply in his own Words,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Defence of Epi&s;copal Ordination, <HI>P. 406.</HI></NOTE> I hope he will not expect that I &s;hould be led by Authorities of modern Authors, (when he him&s;elf hath &s;o often declared again&s;t it) in a Mat|ter of mere Judgment and Rea&s;oning ;or yield to great Names, without con&s;idering the Grounds upon which their A&s;&s;ertions are built. The Grounds of the con|trary Judgment, I have already given: and his pro|found Silence in &s;uch an important Point, is a tacit Acknowledgment, that it is unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>I grant, that as Men may u&s;e the World <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> in different Sen&s;es, and view the Thing in different Lights, &s;o there may be &s;ome Men of great Learning, who taking it in the Sen&s;e of &s;ome <HI>Non-Jurors,</HI> may with Rea&s;on make a Je&s;t of it. But I'm inclined to think there is no &s;ound <HI>Believer,</HI> much le&s;s learned Bi&s;hop or Divine, who will &s;ay, that a Succe&s;&s;ion, (as I u&s;e the Word) is unnece&s;&s;ary; or in other Words, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary that they who ordain &s;hould have Authority &s;o to do: which is all I now plead for.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I would ob&s;erve, this &s;ame learned Divine, now Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> wrote a Treati&s;e on Purpo&s;e to &s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e called <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Mini|&s;ters yielding to be ordained by true Bi&s;hops, in order to their being accounted true Mini&s;ters; in which he has carried the Matter as high, and done it as effec|tually as ever I could wi&s;h to &s;ee it done. And a Man's Judgment is to be di&s;covered by the profe&s;t De&s;ign of his Writing, and not by a &s;ingle Sentence &s;e|parated from all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e are, I think, all the Authorities he has cited to prove the Non-Nece&s;&s;ity of a Succe&s;&s;ion in the Mini&s;try; and whether they are &s;ufficient, I leave to the Reader to judge. I mu&s;t confe&s;s it appears to me to be a very odd Way of Proceeding, to quote Au|thorities
<PB N="14" REF="006637_0013_102971AF26D4DF48">and great Names to prove Contradictions to be Truths, and Impo&s;&s;ibilities to be real Facts, which is really the Ca&s;e here. For if a Succe&s;&s;ion be not nece&s;&s;ary, but Men may be true Amba&s;&s;adors of CHRIST without it, then Men who have no Authority from CHRIST to go them&s;elves or to &s;end others, yet have good Right to con&s;titute Amba&s;&s;adors for him, and tho&s;e &s;o &s;ent without any Authority, yet have good Authority to Sign and Seal in CHRIST'S Name. Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has &s;aid a great deal, and with no &s;mall degree of A&s;&s;urance, which may &s;erve to amu&s;e the Reader and puzzle the Cau&s;e, but every Man of plain common Sen&s;e may with a very little Pains be fully &s;a|tisfied where the Truth lies. When Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has tired him&s;elf with laughing at the Succe&s;&s;ion, only ask him this plain Que&s;tion; &s;uppo&s;ing the Authority CHRIST gave to the Apo&s;tles is not contunied by a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive Ordination, and that &s;uch a Thing is needle&s;s, how can one Man have a better Right than another, to act in CHRIST'S Name, or as his Amba&s;&s;ador? If he &s;hould &s;ay, &s;ome Men were ordained to that Office, but others were not: Ask him again, how came the&s;e Ordainers to have more Power to Ordain than every Body el&s;e? To this he mu&s;t An&s;wer, becau&s;e they them&s;elves had been ordained to the Mini&s;try. And the like An&s;wer he mu&s;t return till you come up to our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD JESUS who was the fir&s;t Ordainer. In a Word, there is no Medium betwixt holding the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Succe&s;&s;ion, and laying the Mini&s;try open and common, and a&s;&s;erting the Lawfulne&s;s of Lay-Ordination.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> is very angry with the <HI>New-Light</HI> Mi|ni&s;ters, becau&s;e they are not ordained by Mini&s;ters, which he &s;uppo&s;es to be the only Method that GOD has appointed. And for that Rea&s;on he &s;ays, <HI>Chri&s;t will condemn them;</HI> and we <HI>&s;hould not countenance</HI> or <HI>re|ceive them.</HI> Now if the Succe&s;&s;ion ever was broke, and the Apo&s;tolick Power lo&s;t, this mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e of all the Mini&s;ters who aro&s;e after that Interruption, and
<PB N="15" REF="006637_0014_102971B68263C548">began a new Succe&s;&s;ion, for there could be no Mini|&s;ters then to ordain them. And if all the Mini&s;ters, for In&s;tance, a Thou&s;and Years ago, undertook the Mi|ni&s;try without an Ordination by Mini&s;ters, we my do &s;o again, and again; it is no Matter how often; for the Apo&s;tolick Power being once lo&s;t, is lo&s;t for ever. And who in that Ca&s;e has any Authority to begin a new Mini&s;try? If &s;ome have a Right to begin a new Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, why have not every one the like Right? Why not <HI>New-Lights</HI> as well as <HI>Old-Lights?</HI> Indeed the Ca&s;e is &s;o exceeding plain and evident, that it &s;hould &s;eem like an Affront to a common Under&s;tanding to take any more Pains to prove, that a Succe&s;&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary to make a lawful Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>I am very &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> in&s;tead of confuting this &s;ort of Rea&s;oning, has given him&s;elf an unaccountable Liberty to &s;lander and mi&s;repre&s;ent us, and imputes to us &s;uch ab&s;urd Tenets as we never had the lea&s;t Inclination to. Thus in his former <HI>Ad|dre&s;s,</HI> he calls the peculiar Whims of the Non-Jurors, our <HI>Darling Principles,</HI> P. 120. And he would have it under&s;tood, that according to our Principles, the Civil Power had no Authority to deprive the Nor-juring Bi&s;hops; with a great deal of the like Nature; which is &s;o far from being true, that I &s;incerely believe, that their <HI>Deprivation</HI> was both ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, and that the <HI>State</HI> had a Right not only to deprive, but to ba|ni&s;h them; as <HI>Solomon</HI> did <HI>Abiathar.</HI> For the State certainly hath a Right to defend and pre&s;erve et&s;elf, which it could not do, if its Enemies were allowed to hold the highe&s;t Dignities in the Church.</P>
<P>The &s;ame untrue and unju&s;t Repre&s;entation of our Principles he con&s;tantly makes in this la&s;t Addre&s;s, a&s;|cribing any Tenets to us, which he can ea&s;ily confute, without any Regard to Truth or Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ays he, <Q>We have already ob&s;erved, that a Succe&s;&s;ion of the Mini&s;try in general will not &s;atisfy Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> but it is a Succe&s;&s;ion in the particular
<PB N="16" REF="006637_0015_102971B80888C0E0">Order of Bi&s;hops, as &s;uperior to Presbyters, which his Scheme makes nece&s;&s;ary, P. 47.</Q></P>
<P>Which is &s;o far from being true, that as I declared before, and he knew it, &s;o I &s;ay again, let the Ordain|ers be called Bi&s;hops, or Presbyters, or Deacons, or Ruling Elders, or Pa&s;tors, let them be Superiors, or Inferiors, or all Equal, it alters not the Ca&s;e &s;o far as the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y is concerned: the only Thing I in&s;i&s;t upon here, is, that they who Ordain, &s;hould have received Authority to &s;end others, as our Article XXIII, requires.</P>
<P>And yet almo&s;t all Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e is pointed again&s;t this Tenet, which he fal&s;ly a&s;cribed to me. And therefore it is no Wonder he has done nothing towards convincing me of my Error, if I am in one.</P>
<P>Again, he affirms, that <Q>according to me, the Laity in their Communion aree in as bad a Situation,</Q> <HI>(as I &s;hould have been in if I had remained with them, again&s;t the Dictates of my own Con&s;cience,)</HI> <Q>For their Accep|tance with GOD, ab&s;olutely depends on &s;uch a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion in the Mini&s;try as they are wholly de&s;titute of.</Q> P. 27. If this be true, I have certainly damned every <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and <HI>Independent</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI> And yet he often affirms that I &s;ay that Men's Accep|tance with GOD, <HI>ab&s;olutely depends upon this Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI> And at the &s;ame Time it is &s;o far from being true, that I hold nothing is <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> nece&s;&s;ary on our Part, but only <HI>Holine&s;s;</HI> I don't e&s;teem the Sacraments them|&s;elves to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P>With what Con&s;cience could Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> charge me with this &s;tingy and uncharitable Opinion, when he &s;aw with his own Eyes the clean Contrary in that Pa|ragraph, part of which he cites? P. 42, where I u&s;ed the&s;e Words, <Q>Had I remained with you, and had the &s;ame Sen&s;e of the Matter as I now have, and (I think) cannot help but have, I fear I &s;hould have <HI>peri&s;hed in the Gain&s;aying of Core,</HI> Jude 11.&mdash;In &s;ay|ing the&s;e Things, I don't judge, cen&s;ure, or con|demn your Mini&s;ters, or mean to in&s;inuate, that they
<PB N="17" REF="006637_0016_102971B98D4DF1E0">cannot be &s;aved. For that is a Sin of Ignorance in another, which in me would be a damning Crime. I am far from judging that your can't be &s;aved in your Way, though erroneous.</Q></P>
<P>Does this look like making Men's Salvation <HI>ab&s;olutely to depend upon the Succe&s;&s;ion?</HI> Does it appear like damning all the Di&s;&s;enters; as he repre&s;ents it? He talks of u&s;ing an <HI>hone&s;t Freedom;</HI> I'm thoroughly convinced of his u&s;ing <HI>Freedom</HI> enough, I only wi&s;h we could &s;ee &s;ome Sign of his <HI>Hone&s;ty.</HI> Let a Man take that Free|dom Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> makes u&s;e of, and he will find no Difficulty to triumph over any Antagoni&s;t, and an&s;wer any Arguments without ever coming near them.</P>
<P>And as to his &s;aying &s;o often, that it is a dreadful Thing to venture our Salvation upon a Succe&s;&s;ion, as we do; I can &s;ee no Sen&s;e in it: For we run no Ven|ture at all; but let it turn out which Way it will, we are as &s;afe as they can be. If GOD don't require us to attend to a Succe&s;&s;ion, then we have only taken a little more Pains to plea&s;e him than was nece&s;&s;ary: But if our Opinion be true, and GOD does require us to attend to the Succe&s;&s;ion; then &s;uch Men who have de&s;pi&s;ed and neglected it, will appear to have con|tracted no &s;mall Guilt.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;e is very much like that of the Chri&s;tian Religion; Infidels tell us, that we venture our Souls upon the Truth of the Go&s;pel, which perhaps may turn out to be a mere <HI>Cheat.</HI> To whom we reply, we don't run any Hazard at all by being Chri&s;tians. For if the Go&s;pel be a <HI>Fiction;</HI> our believing it to be true, and living up to it, can do us no hurt. But if it be true, as we have &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to believe it is, then <HI>Unbe|lievers</HI> are in amazing Danger. So it is here, our Sal|vation is not at all endangered by our believing and regarding a Succe&s;&s;ion in the Mini&s;try, No, it is the only Way to be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> all the Danger lies in neg|lecting it.</P>
<P>And how this can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">troy a Man's Comfort, (as he &s;ays) is quite above my Comprehen&s;ion: for we can
<PB N="18" REF="006637_0017_102971BB2DCFC0B0">con&s;ider, if there be a Succe&s;&s;ion, no Church on Earth has a better Claim to it than the Church of <HI>England;</HI> And if there be no Succe&s;&s;ion, or no need of it, then we are certainly &s;afe, and in no Danger, whether we have it or not. So that we have the Comfort of being <HI>&s;afe,</HI> which is no <HI>&s;mall</HI> Con&s;olation. And every Man for the Peace of his own Con&s;cience &s;hould make a pro|per Enquiry, whether the Mini&s;ter of who&s;e Hands he receives the Sacraments be indeed CHRIST'S <HI>Amba&s;&s;a|dor.</HI> And that Plea which &s;ome of the Laity make for their Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in this Affair, will not excu&s;e their Sloth before GOD, that is, <HI>let Mini&s;ters di&s;pute this Point among them&s;elves; it don't belong to us to trouble our Heads about that Controver&s;y, who are lawful Mini&s;ters.</HI> For he who is qualified to &s;erve on a <HI>Jury</HI> to try Men's Titles to an E&s;tate, can't pretend that he is not capable to form a Judgment in this Ca&s;e. And to &s;ay that it will not be enquired in the Day of Judgment, whether we were Church Men or Presbyterians, is not true; for we are accountable for our carele&s;s Neglect of the lea&s;t Truth that we might have known. And the more diligent and faithful we have been to know, and do the Truth, the more acceptable we &s;hall be to our great Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>As to his &s;aying, that our Notion of a Succe&s;&s;ion tends to Infidelity, it is equally groundle&s;s: for an uninter|rupted Succe&s;&s;ion in the Mini&s;try is a &s;tanding Proof of the Truth of Chri&s;tianity. But it tempts Men to de&s;pi&s;e the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, when they hear them call them&s;elves CHRIST'S <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors,</HI> and pretend to be his <HI>Agents</HI> or <HI>Attornies,</HI> to <HI>act, &s;ign,</HI> and <HI>&s;eal</HI> in CHRIST'S Name and Stead; and yet know, that CHRIST never &s;ent them, nor any impower'd by him. What Man of Sen&s;e can reverence &s;uch <HI>Pretenders</HI> as CHRIST'S <HI>Repre&s;entatives;</HI> when a Man can't be a <HI>Attorney</HI> for the poore&s;t Fellow in the Land, without his own Act and Appointment? And when Mini&s;ters are de&s;pi&s;ed, and not e&s;teemed as CHRIST'S Amba&s;&s;adors, Religion et&s;elf will fall into Contempt with them.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="006637_0018_102971BFA3D781B0">
The only Argument, I think, which he produces to prove that there is no Nece&s;&s;ity of Succe&s;&s;ion, is the want of Evidence that in Fact there has been a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion. Now to prevent contending where we don't really deffer, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that he a&s;&s;erts the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a Succe&s;&s;ion in the very &s;ame Sen&s;e as I do. For, P. 55, 56, he affirms, a <HI>&s;tanding Mini&s;try is an Ordinance of</HI> CHRIST; which is the very &s;ame, as when I &s;ay, an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion in the Mini&s;try is CHRIST'S Ordinance. He makes Impo&s;ition of Hands by Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters of Nece&s;&s;ity to make a lawful Mi|ni&s;ter. And he &s;ays, <HI>it is di&s;orderly and &s;inful to depart from this Method,</HI> P. 56. Now by <HI>Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters,</HI> he means &s;uch as have the Power of Ordination, for he thinks all Go&s;pel Min&s;ters have this Power. And <HI>this</HI> (&s;ay he) <HI>is &s;ufficient to condemn the</HI> New-Light Separa|ti&s;ts <HI>with their Lay-Ordinations &mdash; The&s;e di&s;orderly Wal|kers have Rea&s;on to expect that</HI> CHRIST, <HI>in&s;tead of owning them as his Mini&s;ters, will reject and condemn them for acting contrary to his Will, di&s;covered by the Practice and Example of his Apo&s;tles, which he cau&s;ed to be recorded for the In&s;truction of his Church in all Ages.</HI> And the <HI>Di|rection given to the Churches of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>with Regard to &s;uch di&s;orderly and irregular Per&s;ons, is not to countenance, own or receive them, but on the contrary to di&s;countenance and cen&s;ure them.</HI> Now if this Doctrine be true, that CHRIST will condemn tho&s;e who act as Mini&s;ters, and yet are not ordained by the <HI>Impo&s;ition of commi&s;&s;i|onated Hands,</HI> as he affirms, then it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that if this unlawful Mini&s;ter who was ordained by uncommi&s;&s;ionated Hands Ye&s;ter-day, &s;hould ordain a &s;econd Min&s;ter To-day, CHRIST will condemn him too; becau&s;e all the Mini&s;terial Acts of the fir&s;t, are di&s;|owned and condemned by CHRIST. And if this &s;econd unlawful Mini&s;ter &s;hould To-morrow ordain a <HI>third,</HI> CHRIST will likewi&s;e di&s;own and condemn him too. And &s;o on to the End, though they &s;hould continue this <HI>di&s;orderly</HI> and <HI>irregular</HI> Practice a hundred, or a thou|&s;and Years, yet CHRIST will never own them for his
<PB N="20" REF="006637_0019_102971C413233738">Mini&s;ters; neither &s;hould his <HI>Churches countenance, but cen&s;ure them.</HI> Wickedne&s;s by a long Duration will not become a Virtue. Thus Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> and I are entirely agreed, in the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Succe&s;&s;ion; only he is too much of a <HI>High-Flier</HI> for me, and is too rigid and &s;evere towards them who have no Succe&s;&s;ion; for he boldly affirms that CHRIST <HI>will reject and condemn them:</HI> Whereas I hope CHRIST will pardon their Mi&s;takes and Irregularities, and accept of their Sincerity; though at the &s;ame Time I &s;hould not dare to venture upon &s;uch an unlawful Practice, nor countenance tho&s;e who do, and that is the Rea&s;on of my leaving the Di&s;&s;enters. You &s;ee now, that after all Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Exclamations again&s;t a Succe&s;&s;ion, he differs from me about it in no|thing but only in being more uncharitable, &s;tingy and &s;evere towards tho&s;e who have it not.</P>
<P>If one were di&s;po&s;ed to be merry, it would be really diverting to ob&s;erve how much Pains he takes to &s;eem to differ from me; and yet after all his Toil and Sweat, he can't get one Inch from my Opinion. He delivers his Opinion thus, P. 56. <HI>Upon the whole; to make Ordi|nation, meaning thereby, Impo&s;ition of commi&s;&s;ionated Hands, nece&s;&s;ary in Point of Order, is a different Thing from making it e&s;&s;ential to the mini&s;terial Character.</HI></P>
<P>And yet ju&s;t before in the &s;ame Page he had &s;aid, that <HI>it is &s;inful</HI> and <HI>di&s;orderly</HI> to neglect &s;uch Ordination: that CHRIST will not <HI>own</HI> &s;uch as do neglect it <HI>for his Mini&s;ters, but reject and condemn them,</HI> and the Churches &s;hould not <HI>countenance, own, or receive them, but di&s;coun|tenance and cen&s;ure them.</HI> Now if it be not <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to a Mini&s;ter, that he &s;hould not enter upon the Work <HI>in a &s;inful</HI> and <HI>di&s;orderly</HI> Manner, but come in at the Door, if it be not <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to a Min&s;ter, that he &s;hould be &s;o ordained, as that CHRIST will <HI>own</HI> him for <HI>his Mini&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>not reject and condemn him;</HI> if it be not <HI>e&s;|&s;ential to the mini&s;terial Character,</HI> that he who pretends to it &s;hould be &s;o <HI>authorized</HI> as that the Churches &s;hould not be obliged to <HI>di&s;own, di&s;countenance,</HI> and <HI>cen|&s;ure</HI> him; I &s;ay, if this be not <HI>e&s;&s;ential, I wonder what
<PB N="21" REF="006637_0020_102971C59837C0B8">is. But <HI>upon the whole,</HI> this I mu&s;t &s;ay, let it be e&s;&s;ential</HI> or <HI>circum&s;tantial,</HI> I don't think it &s;afe to be in &s;uch Mini&s;ters Condition; &s;ince Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;ays him&s;elf, CHRIST will not <HI>own</HI> but <HI>condemn</HI> them; and for fear of that I cho&s;e to be ordained by <HI>commi&s;&s;ionated Hands.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed you may try it every Way, and as long as you plea&s;e; and after all, you will find it impo&s;&s;ible to condemn the <HI>New-Light</HI> Mini&s;try, without a&s;&s;erting the Succe&s;&s;ion. For what is wanting in their Mini&s;try, but only that they who ordained them, had no Com|mi&s;&s;ion for it? And can we imagine that when a Man is ordained without any Authority, yet that he him&s;elf &s;hould have good Authority to ordain? Or that his Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould have it, though he had not? No &s;urely. But as in <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> a thou&s;and <HI>Noughts</HI> in a Row make no Sum; &s;o a thou&s;and &s;uch Ordinations &s;ucceeding one another, will not make one lawful Mi|ni&s;ter, but CHRIST may condemn the la&s;t as well as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But to help Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Charity towards the <HI>New-Light</HI> Mini&s;ters, whom he in Scorn to us, calls our <HI>Brethren,</HI> I can tell him, that they are nearer a-kin to him than he is aware; for by conver&s;ing with &s;ome of them, I find, that they have a Mixture of a <HI>Presby|terian</HI> Ordination with their Lay-Orders, and &s;ome Mi|ni&s;ters have laid their Hands on them together with the Brethren; &s;o that within a little Time the <HI>Lea|thern-Mitten</HI> will be quite worn out with them too; and theirs will become very good and <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial Pre&s;|byterian</HI> Ordination.</P>
<P>I come now to another Part of the Argument. I had &s;aid, that GOD made it the Duty of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to attend to the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Levitical Mini&s;try, and it is equally nece&s;&s;ary to attend to the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, and there is as much if not more Evidence to direct us as to the Go&s;pel Succe&s;&s;ion, than there was to direct them about the <HI>Levitical.</HI> In An|&s;wer to this, he allows, that there was a Succe&s;&s;ion in
<PB N="22" REF="006637_0021_102971C76A827628">that Mini&s;try and Prie&s;thood; But then he &s;ays, it was a <HI>legal Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and it had a <HI>legal Proof,</HI> P. 62, 64, 65. But &s;till he very much <HI>defies</HI> that we &s;hould pretend, that there is as <HI>clear</HI> Evidence of a Succe&s;&s;ion under the Go&s;pel, as there was under the Law. Here then let us join I&s;&s;ue, and if I can't prove that there is the &s;ame kind of Evidence of the Succe&s;&s;ion under the Go&s;pel, as there was under the Law, and if I can't pro|duce as good Proof that I was ordained by one who had Authority from the Apo&s;tles by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Ordi|nation, as an ordinary Prie&s;t at Chri&s;t's Birth could &s;hew for his De&s;cent from <HI>Aaron,</HI> then I'll contentedly bear his Reproach of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> To begin, he &s;ays, that the <HI>Aaronical Prie&s;ts</HI> had a <HI>good legal Proof,</HI> and they had <HI>only a legal Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI> And the &s;ame I &s;ay of the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion under the Go&s;pel; a hidden and &s;ecret Succe&s;&s;ion, and invi&s;ible and &s;ecret Defects which are known only to GOD, I have no Concern with: <HI>&s;ecret Things belong unto GOD. What does not appear, is not.</HI> But what <HI>legal Proof</HI> had the <HI>Aaronical Prie&s;ts</HI> at the Time of CHRIST'S coming in the Fle&s;h? Why, he tells us, P. 64. <HI>Authentick Regi&s;ters of the Sacerdotal Family were kept among the Jews as long, and with as great Care as tho&s;e of the Royal Family.</HI> And this is the whole of his <HI>legal Proof.</HI> And if I &s;hould allow it to be altogether true, it would not amount to any Proof at all, that the&s;e Prie&s;ts were <HI>Aaron</HI>'s De&s;cendents; for he don't pretend that the&s;e <HI>Regi&s;ters</HI> were kept longer than tho&s;e of the Royal Family: and it was &s;everal hundred Years after <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Death before there was any <HI>Royal Family:</HI> How then could any Man know what Interruptions might happen in the Prie&s;thood between the Death of <HI>Aaron</HI> and the reign of King <HI>David?</HI></P>
<P>But that we may not be amu&s;ed with empty Words, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould con&s;ider, what is meant by <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters, kept</HI> of all the De&s;cendents of <HI>Levi.</HI> And doubtle&s;s it mu&s;t mean, that among the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> there were Officers &s;worn to record every Male Child of the Tribe of Levi, and that this Prac|tice
<PB N="23" REF="006637_0022_102971CD53AA7450">was begun in <HI>Aaron's</HI> Life Time, and without any Interruption continued in all Places and in all Times of their Apo&s;tacy, Captivity and Di&s;per&s;ions till CHRIST came. If Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has Credulity enough to believe this to be fact, he can't meet with any difficulty in be|lieving all the Jewi&s;h <HI>Fables</HI> and <HI>Oral Law,</HI> or all the Legends of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>I grant, that the Jews &s;ome times made <HI>Regi&s;ters,</HI> and &s;o has the Chri&s;tian Church much more. Every Bi&s;hop in <HI>England,</HI> has his Name in more than one <HI>au|thentick Regi&s;ter.</HI> Nay every <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> and <HI>Deacon</HI> is re|gi&s;tered. But then neither the&s;e nor the Jewi&s;h Re|gi&s;ters are <HI>everla&s;ting;</HI> but by accidents may be de&s;troy|ed. The Text he cites to prove that the Jews kept Regi&s;ters is a full Proof of this. Ezra ii. 61, 62. <HI>The Children of Barzillai, which took a Wife of the Daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their Name: The&s;e &s;ought their Regi&s;ter among tho&s;e who were reckoned by Genealogy, but they were not found.</HI> Upon this Text, Dr. <HI>Patrick</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>this Per&s;on, who&s;oever he was, thought it &s;o great an Honour to be de&s;cended from &s;uch a noble Family as that of <HI>Barzillai,</HI> that he cho&s;e to be called by that Name, which he preferred be|fore his own in the Family of the Prie&s;ts: By which vain Ambition he lo&s;t his Title to the Prie&s;thood, becau&s;e he could not make out his Pedigree from the Prie&s;ts, but from <HI>Barzillai.</HI></Q> From hence it is evident, that though the Jews &s;ometimes made Regi|&s;ters of their Prie&s;ts, yet they did not con&s;tantly do &s;o. No &s;uch Thing was done in their Captivity: And the Regi&s;ters they had before the Captivity, when the City and Temple were burnt, and the Remains of the People in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion carried Cap|tive, even the&s;e were burnt or otherwi&s;e lo&s;t; at lea&s;t in great Part. So that upon their return from <HI>Babylon</HI> they mu&s;t know who were Prie&s;ts by their retaining the Names of tho&s;e who had formerly executed the Prie&s;t Office in the Temple. So that if this Man had not exchanged his own Name in the
<PB N="24" REF="006637_0023_102971D050D5D080">Family of the Prie&s;ts for his Wives more honourable Name, though he had no Regi&s;ter to &s;how, yet he would not have been put by the Prie&s;thood. Regi&s;ters they often had, which in all Probability were made by the help of Tradition, &s;ome hundred Years after &s;ome of the Per&s;ons named in them were dead. And the Chri&s;tian Church abounds with &s;uch <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters.</HI> If you &s;hould ask how the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> could know, who belonged to the <HI>Royal,</HI> who to the <HI>Aaronical</HI> Family, and &s;o to every Tribe and Family in order to their quiet Enjoyment of the Land which GOD gave them by Lot; if there were no authentick Regi&s;ters kept, how could they know, what <HI>Land,</HI> or what <HI>Offices</HI> belonged to each Man? I an&s;wer, they knew it by Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by Tradition, by their retaining the Names of their &s;e|veral Families, as other Nations do; but much le&s;s by <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters</HI> and publick Records kept under Oath, than we do. And GOD never had appointed this Method; and if he did, they were far from care|fully ob&s;erving it. The ignorant and barbarous <HI>In|dians,</HI> know very well, who among them are <HI>Sachems</HI> by De&s;cent, and they have good legal Proof of it, without keeping <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters.</HI> And the I&s;raelites in the Time of their Idolatry and Ignorance u&s;ed no better Methods to pre&s;erve the Pedigree of their Prie&s;ts <HI>clear,</HI> than the Indians do that of their <HI>Sachems,</HI> neither were they &s;o careful and zealous about it, as will evidently appear, if we con&s;ider, how often they for|&s;ook the true GOD, and fell into the mo&s;t &s;otti&s;h Ido|latry. Among the ten Tribes, from the Divi&s;ion of the Kingdom till their final Captivity, any Body was al|lowed to execute the Prie&s;ts Office: It is therefore certain no <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters</HI> of the true <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> were kept among them. In <HI>Judah,</HI> often, and for a long Time together, the Prie&s;t's Work was entirely laid a&s;ide, and they undi&s;tingui&s;hed from common Men. Nay &s;o little Regard had they for the true Religion, that the Bible it&s;elf was not known among them. And when one was found, both the high Prie&s;t and King were mightily
<PB N="25" REF="006637_0024_102971D1D6A637CO">&s;urprized at what was contained in it. Now can we &s;uppo&s;e, that they were extreamly careful to keep <HI>Regi&s;ters</HI> of all the Males born in the Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> when they were &s;o &s;tupid and carele&s;s as to lo&s;e the Holy Bible, which contained all their Religion? Did ever &s;uch &s;tupid Negligence and &s;otti&s;h Ignorance ob|tain in the Chri&s;tian Church? It is true, the Chri&s;tian Church did decline from their fir&s;t Purity and Zeal; and the We&s;tern Church fell into Super&s;tition and Ido|latry: yet never were they without many Thou&s;and Copies of the Holy Scriptures. Never was the Chri&s;tian Church &s;o carele&s;s, as to &s;uffer Men to perform the &s;acred Offices unle&s;s they had been ordained by <HI>commi&s;&s;ionated Hands.</HI> Records and Hi&s;tories of every Age &s;ince Chri&s;t's A&s;cention, afford a <HI>good legal Proof</HI> of this. But can we imagine, that the Jews were careful to keep the Prie&s;thood pure and unmixt, and <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters,</HI> of all who were born to it, when they had no Wor&s;hip of GOD at all among them; and were re&s;olved never to have again? For what End &s;hould they pre&s;erve the Prie&s;thood pure, when they never intended to make any U&s;e of it? I may appeal to any Man who is not under the <HI>Influence of &s;ome En|thu&s;ia&s;tick In&s;tinct,</HI> whether it is probable, that the I&s;ra|elites kept <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters</HI> of the true Prie&s;ts, when <HI>there was no King in I&s;rael, and every Man did what was right in his own Eyes?</HI> As Micah who him&s;elf ordained his own Son, and then a Levite for a Prie&s;t, when the whole Nation had lo&s;t the Kowledge of GOD and his Prie&s;thood, and are thus de&s;cribed, 2 Chron. xv. 3. <HI>Now for a long Sea&s;on I&s;rael hath been without the true GOD, and without a teaching Prie&s;t, and without Law.</HI> That Nation for a long Time was &s;unk into &s;uch Ig|norance and Stupidity, that it is more probable, that not one Prie&s;t in a Thou&s;and could either read or write, than that they kept <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters</HI> of all who were born to the Prie&s;thood. And one might almo&s;t as well look for <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters</HI> among the wild <HI>Indians,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="006637_0025_102971D378372CA0">as to expect to find them in tho&s;e Ages of Dark|ne&s;s, Confu&s;ion and Irreligion among the I&s;raelites.</P>
<P>How can it be thought, that this People were &s;o exceeding careful to keep <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters</HI> of all their Prie&s;ts and their Children, when there was no officiating Prie&s;ts among them, and they never intended that there &s;hould be any? Yet this was often, for a long Time together the State of the Jewi&s;h Church. But was this, or any thing like it ever the Ca&s;e of the Chri&s;tian Church; or of the Church of <HI>England?</HI> Cer|tainly it was not. But there always has been a <HI>Stand|ing and officiating Mini&s;try.</HI> In a Word, whatever good <HI>legal Proof</HI> he &s;hall find for the <HI>Aaronical</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, the &s;ame in kind, and much clearer I will produce for the Succe&s;&s;ion under the Go&s;pel. But when he in&s;inuates that the Jewi&s;h Prie&s;ts at Chri&s;t's Time could all of them produce <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters</HI> of their Pedigree reaching up to <HI>Aaron,</HI> I mu&s;t u&s;e the <HI>hone&s;t Freedom</HI> to tell him it is not only perfect Fiction and Romance, but plainly contradicted by the holy Scripture, <HI>Ezra</HI> ii. 62.</P>
<P>And yet I allow that they had then, as we now have a good <HI>legal Proof</HI> of a Right by Succe&s;&s;ion. We now have &s;uch Evidence of our Title to the Mini&s;try by Succe&s;&s;ion, as all Nations, all Ages and Courts allow to be a good <HI>legal Proof</HI> of a good Title to an E&s;tate. And there is no Man now in <HI>England</HI> pro&s;&s;e&s;t of an an|cient E&s;tate by De&s;cent, who can give a <HI>better legal Proof</HI> of his <HI>legal</HI> Right to it, than every Bi&s;hop can give of his Right to the Mini&s;terial Authority by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Ordination.</P>
<P>But as for his pretending that the Jews were more careful to keep <HI>authentick Regi&s;ters</HI> than Chri&s;tians have been, which is all that he can offer on this Subject, it is perfectly impo&s;&s;ible for me to believe it, while I con|&s;ider, how much more Knowledge has prevailed in the Chri&s;tian, than in the Jewi&s;h Church; and how much more careful Chri&s;tians have been to pre&s;erve the di|vine Ordinances pure, than the Jews were. The Jews
<PB N="27" REF="006637_0026_10293BAC96DB6120">for many Years together wholly neglected GOD's Or|dinances, Circumci&s;ion, the Pa&s;&s;over, &amp;c. and in a Manner forgot them. And is it likely that they were mighty careful about the Prie&s;thood? It is morally im|po&s;&s;ible. But the Chri&s;tian Church never did de&s;pi&s;e and neglect Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper: But al|ways ob&s;erved them with great Veneration, they never were in any Age carele&s;s about the Oridination of their Clergy, &s;o as to neglect it, or &s;uffer it to be perfor|med by Lay-Men. If any Man denies this, let him name the Age, when the Chri&s;tian Church neglected the&s;e Ordinances of CHRIST. Whereas it is very ea&s;y to prove from holy Scripture that the I&s;raelites wholly laid a&s;ide and de&s;pi&s;ed the Ordinances of their GOD, together with his Prie&s;ts. I have now done with this Head, and I hope I have &s;aid enough, if not more than enough to prove, that we have as good a Proof of our Succe&s;&s;ion from the Apo&s;tles, as the Jewi&s;h Prie&s;ts had of their De&s;cent from <HI>Aaron.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II.

I &s;hall now examine his Rea&s;ons for di&s;puting the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Church of <HI>England:</HI> And &s;hall begin with an Argument he u&s;ed in his fir&s;t Addre&s;s, P. 121. which he thinks I did not &s;uffi|ciently attend to. I &s;hall therefore now make ample Amends. He tells us Arch Bi&s;hop <HI>Parker</HI> was ordained by four Bi&s;hops who had been <HI>legally deprived</HI> in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, and were not re&s;tored when they per|formed this Action. This he &s;ays, <HI>renders</HI> Parker's <HI>Con&s;ecration very doubtful, and indeed bids fair to nullify it.</HI> P. 74. and <HI>yet upon this,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>all the Ordinations in the Church of England to this Day depend. And after all,</HI> he tells us, <HI>an Act of Parliament was procured to confirm</HI> Parker<HI>'s Con&s;ecration about &s;even Years after it was per|formed.</HI> Let us try now, whether we can't fairly get over the&s;e two Difficulties, and give &s;uch an Account of the Affair as &s;hall &s;atisfy any rea&s;onable Per&s;on. The <HI>legal Deprivation</HI> which the&s;e Bi&s;hops were under did not at all hinder their giving valid Orders. So the Government thought; othersi&s;e they would have re|&s;tored them, before they employed them to con&s;ecrate <HI>Parker.</HI> Can any <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> of Sen&s;e imagine, that a Papi&s;t Queen and Parliament could really and forever take away the Power of Ordination given by CHRIST to his Mini&s;ters? if &s;o, then the Heathen Kings and Emperors could have deprived the Apo&s;tles and all CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters of that Authority he gave them, and have reduced them to the Condition of mere Lay-Men. I grant with his Author, that when the&s;e deprived Bi|&s;hops were employed to con&s;ecrate <HI>Parker,</HI> the <HI>Legal|ity</HI>

<P>'Tis worth ob&s;erving, that this Cavil in&s;tead of weakening, does very much confirm the Succe&s;&s;ion and expell all Doubts: For can we imagine that the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI>

But all that <HI>Bonner</HI> and other inveterate Enemies had to object, was this, that the Book of Or|dination which the <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> Parliament had condemned, had not yet been legally revived by the Prote&s;tant Par|liament, which if it had been true (as it was fal&s;e) yet it would have amounted to no more than a <HI>legal</HI> De|fect, which would not at all have hurt their Character as Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, and Bi&s;hops of his Church. Neither CHRIST, nor his Apo&s;tles, nor any other of his Mini&s;ters for three hundred Years, had any <HI>legal</HI> Right to officiate in any Nation on Earth: And if there is any Truth in what Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>this bids fair to nullify</HI> Parker'<HI>s Ordination;</HI> it certainly bids much fairer to nullify all the authoritative Acts of CHRIST, and of all his Mini&s;ters for the fir&s;t three hundred Years, for it is certain, none of them were <HI>legal,</HI> or according to the Law of any Nation in which they officiated. What mi&s;erable Shifts is this Writer driven to in order to prove that our Ordinations are <HI>di&s;puta|ble,</HI> even &s;uch as prove our Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Ordinati|on to be equally, nay, more <HI>di&s;putable.</HI> Here I &s;hall ob&s;erve once for all, that the Bi&s;hops of <HI>England</HI> are to be con&s;idered in a twofold Capacity, either as to their &s;piritual Power, or as to their temporal Privileges and Honours. As to the Calling and Authority of Bi&s;hops in &s;piritual Matters it is derived from CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles by Ordination, and from no other, neither King nor Parliament can give or take it away: But be&s;ides this &s;piritual Authority, the Bi&s;hops of <HI>England</HI> have certain temporal Honours and E&s;tates
<PB N="32" REF="006637_0031_102971E6F16D4A30">be&s;towed on them by the King's Bounty, together with Juri&s;diction in Ca&s;es of Marriage, Wills and the like from continual U&s;age, which are ratified and confirmed to them by <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> like the E&s;tates and Privi|leges of other Subjects of the Realm. Now the&s;e tem|poral Privileges depend upon the <HI>Legality</HI> of their Or|dination; &s;o that if the Book by which they were or|dained, had been ever &s;o agreeable to the holy Scrip|ture, yet if it had not been e&s;tabli&s;hed by Act of Par|liament, they could not be e&s;teemed Bi&s;hops in Law, i. e. they could not have held their temporal Privileges, no, nor legally have exerci&s;ed their &s;piritual Powers in <HI>England;</HI> and yet at the &s;ame Time their Authority as CHRIST'S Emba&s;&s;adors would have remained neverthe|le&s;s certain and <HI>indi&s;putable.</HI> Now the Act of Parlia|ment under Con&s;ideration was not intended to put their <HI>&s;piritual Character</HI> out of Di&s;pute, but their temporal, <HI>that is,</HI> to declare that their Ordination was according to the Laws of the Land; &s;o that they &s;hould meet with no Oppo&s;ition in obtaining their temporal Dues, or in exerci&s;ing their eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction, which by Law belonged to them, ju&s;t as an Act of Parliament confirms any other Subjects in the peaceable Enjoy|ment of their E&s;tates and Fortunes; when through &s;ome unrea&s;onable Pretences they have been liable to a Mole&s;tation in the Law.</P>
<P>Now I hope I have &s;aid enough to &s;hew that <HI>Par|ker</HI>'s Con&s;ecration &s;tands as <HI>fair</HI> and as <HI>clear</HI> from all rational Exceptions in Point of <HI>Validity,</HI> as it is po&s;&s;ible for any Ordination to be. By the Way, if any &s;hould enquire, why did not Queen <HI>Elizabeth's Prote&s;tant</HI> Par|liament re&s;tore tho&s;e <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Bi&s;hops whom Queen <HI>Mary's Papi&s;t</HI> Parliament had deprived of their Bi&s;hop|ricks?

<P>Now the Que&s;tion lying betwixt us is this, whether the civil Powers, Kings, Parliaments, or Emperors can take away from CHRIST'S <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors,</HI> that Authority which he gave them in Ordination, and ab&s;olutely vacate his Commi&s;&s;ion? He pretends to hold, that they can, and have done it. And I am proving that they cannot do it. I own they have a Right to put to Death, ba|ni&s;h or deprive Bi&s;hops of the Liberty of executing their &s;piritual Powers in their Dominions: but they cannot vacate their Commi&s;&s;ion, or &s;o deprive them, that they mu&s;t cea&s;e to the CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters, and lo&s;e his Com|mi&s;&s;ion. Otherwi&s;e CHRIST'S Commi&s;&s;ion from his Father, and the Apo&s;tles Commi&s;&s;ion from CHRIST, might have been taken away from them by the civil Powers, under whom they lived. The&s;e their implaca|ble Enemies did all they could to <HI>deprive</HI> them, but they knew of no other Method than to impri&s;on, bani&s;h and kill them. But it &s;eems, if Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> had lived at that Time he could have taught them a more ea&s;y and effec|tual Method, which was only to pa&s;s an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Depriva|tion,</HI> and then it would have been all over with the&s;e Preachers; and CHRIST'S Kingdom would have been at an End. And doubtle&s;s if the civil Powers can deprive us of CHRIST'S Authority given in Ordination, they can deprive us of our Chri&s;tianity obtained in Bapti&s;m too. If they can <HI>unmake</HI> Men as Bi&s;hops, they <HI>can unmake</HI> us as Chri&s;tians too. If they can di&s;annul Ordination, they can al&s;o di&s;annul Bapti&s;m. Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;ays, our Opi|nion tempts Men to turn Infidels: But what can tempt Men more to de&s;pi&s;e CHRIST'S Kingdom and Religion, than to ob&s;erve that there is nothing &s;acred in it; but that all its Powers are given and taken away ju&s;t as the State plea&s;es? Nay, that the Enemies of CHRIST can when they plea&s;e vacate his Commi&s;&s;ion and nullify all
<PB N="34" REF="006637_0033_102971ED0F980508">his Authority? Again, if the Parliament's <HI>Deprivation</HI> did <HI>unmake</HI> the deprived Bi&s;hops, then could they not be re&s;tored without a new Ordination: a &s;econd Con&s;e|cration in that Ca&s;e mu&s;t be as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary as the fir&s;t was. But &s;uch a Thing was never heard of. So that I cannot think that a Man of Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Sen&s;e can po&s;&s;ibly think that there is any Solidity in what he has &s;aid to prove that the civil Powers did take away from CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters the Authority committed to them in Ordination; and yet if he did not believe it him&s;elf, I'm at a lo&s;s to account for his <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> in taking &s;o much Pains to per&s;wade the ignorant that it was really &s;o. And although the Act of <HI>Deprivation</HI> names <HI>Offices;</HI> yet that denotes no other <HI>Offices</HI> than what they had re|ceived from the State, not &s;uch as they had received from CHRIST. The Office committed to them in Ordination they cannot re&s;ign or part with, although they &s;hould be ever &s;o de&s;irous to part with it.</P>
<P>And though the&s;e Bi&s;hops had acknowledged that they had received their <HI>Spiritualities</HI> from the King, yet this means no more than that they were beholden to him for the Liberty of executing their &s;piritual Powers in his Dominions; or as it was expre&s;t in &s;ome Patents, <HI>to perform all Parts of the Epi&s;copal Function, that by the Word of GOD were committed to Bi&s;hops.</HI> Now the&s;e Offices and Liberties which the State had given, they ju&s;tly took away from their Enemies. And whereas he &s;uppo&s;es, that I expo&s;e my&s;elf to the Re&s;entment of my Superiors by this Plea; it is &s;o far from the Truth, that it is the Plea that all the Friends of the Revolution and pre&s;ent <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> have ever made: And on the other Hand, his Pretence that the Act of <HI>Deprivation</HI> was de&s;igned to <HI>unmake</HI> the <HI>Non-juring</HI> Bi&s;hops, and va|cate their Commi&s;&s;ion from CHRIST, is one of the wor&s;t Slanders that the mo&s;t virulent Non-Jurors and <HI>Jacobites</HI> ever ca&s;t upon the Government. And had I &s;aid &s;uch Things as he has done, I confe&s;s I &s;hould have had &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion of Danger. But as to Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> he
<PB N="35" REF="006637_0034_102971F1876E1980">may write what he plea&s;es without incurring any Danger at all in this World, that is the Privilege of the <HI>Lawle&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Non-juring Bi&s;hops in King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, as our Succe&s;&s;ion is not through them, &s;o they were not &s;o ab&s;urd as to pretend that the Bi&s;hops who &s;ucceeded in their <HI>Sees</HI> had not Authority by Virtue of their <HI>Con|&s;ecration</HI> to confer valid Orders, they only &s;aid that no other Bi&s;hops had a Right to their <HI>Sees</HI> while they were alive, which whether true, or fal&s;e, alters not our Ca&s;e, nor hurts our Succe&s;&s;ion. For our Ordinations are not like tho&s;e of the Independents, we are not ordained to this or that See, or Pari&s;h, or Flock; but Mini&s;ters of JESUS CHRIST without any particular Relation to one Place more than another.</P>
<P>And therefore &s;uppo&s;ing, with the <HI>Non Jurors,</HI> that Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> had no Right before GOD to be Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> while Dr. <HI>Sancroft</HI> was alive, yet that can rai&s;e no Di&s;pute about the Validity of his Epi&s;|copal Con&s;ecration; for he was not ordained to that <HI>See</HI> more than to any other.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation would be needle&s;s, if Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> did not undertake to write confidently about &s;uch Things, as he has no proper Knowledge of. Now to &s;um up the Evidence on both Sides, and leave it to the Read|er's Judgment. Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> pretends, it is likely that the Succe&s;&s;ion was broken when Dr. <HI>Parker</HI> was con&s;e|crated. The <HI>Nag's Head</HI> Story he now tells us he al|ways looked upon as a Fal&s;hood, P. 74. But then <HI>Par|ker</HI> was ordained by four Bi&s;hops who had been deprived by Act of Parliament under Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and not then re&s;tored, &s;o that they <HI>were under a legal Incapacity,</HI> P. 75. To which I reply,</P>
<P N="1">1. All the Bi&s;hops who ordained <HI>Parker,</HI> were not under a <HI>Deprivation,</HI> and therefore &s;uppo&s;ing, that Depri|vation had reduced them to the Condition of mere Lay|men, yet if but one of the four was a true Bi&s;hop, that Ordination was valid.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="36" REF="006637_0035_102971F30CC4D838">
2. This Deprivation was no more than the civil Power's re&s;training their acting as Bi&s;hops in their own Dominions; and when this Re&s;traint was by the civil Power taken off, that <HI>Deprivation</HI> then, and &s;o far cea&s;ed. Now Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s granting a <HI>Warrant</HI> to the&s;e <HI>deprived</HI> Bi&s;hops to con&s;ecrate <HI>Parker,</HI> &s;o far took off the <HI>Deprivation,</HI> and purged even the <HI>legal</HI> Defect.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nay, &s;uppo&s;ing they had had no <HI>Warrant</HI> from the civil Power to ordain, yet their ordaining <HI>Parker</HI> ac|cording to the Go&s;pel, would have been very good and valid; though ever &s;o much again&s;t the Will of the Government. For &s;uch were all the Ordinations tran&s;|acted in the Church for three hundred Years after CHRIST, all being <HI>illegal,</HI> or again&s;t Law.</P>
<P N="4">4. If <HI>Deprivation</HI> unmakes Bi&s;hops, then they could never after do any Epi&s;copal Act without a &s;econd Or|dination, a Re&s;toration by Act of Parliament will not make a Bi&s;hop of him who was not a Bi&s;hop before that Act. Indeed I could not have believed, had I not &s;een it, that the Power of Prejudice &s;hould be &s;o great, as to make a wi&s;e Man continue &s;uch a Noi&s;e about a civil Deprivation by a Papi&s;t Parliament, and call it <HI>un|making</HI> Bi&s;hops, and I know not what. Suppo&s;e, that Queen <HI>Mary</HI> and her Parliament had bani&s;hed the&s;e <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Bi&s;hops out of the Nation, and they had gone and &s;ettled in &s;ome other Parts of the Earth, can any Man &s;u&s;pect that this Deprivation would have followed them to the Ends of the Earth, and have rendered them uncapable of acting as CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters? And yet this Bani&s;hment is <HI>Deprivation,</HI> and a great deal more.</P>
<P>From this Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> makes a &s;tart back to the A|po&s;tles Time; and &s;ays, P. 76. <HI>Having thus taken a view of two or three Links at this End of the Chain, and &s;een how flawy and defective they look; let us now examine a few Links at the other End.</HI>&mdash;And here produces two Evidences to make it doubtful who were the fir&s;t Bi&s;hops in <HI>Rome:</HI> And adds his own Remark, P, 84. thus,
<PB N="37" REF="006637_0036_102971F60AC93B00"><HI>I know of no other Scheme on which the Difficulties that occur in the Succe&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Per&s;ons can be &s;olved.</HI></P>
<P>If he knows of none, I can acquaint him with one, which Mr. <HI>Bingham</HI> has given us,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antigu. V.</HI> 1. P. <HI>57.</HI></NOTE> <Q>It is true, &s;ays he, there is a little Difference in the Account which the&s;e Authors give of the Succe&s;&s;ion: for &s;ome reckon <HI>Linus</HI> fir&s;t, then <HI>Anacletus,</HI> then <HI>Clemens;</HI> others begin with <HI>Clemens,</HI> and reckon him the fir&s;t in Order from St. <HI>Peter,</HI> but this is ea&s;ily reconciled by learned Men; who make it appear that <HI>Linus</HI> and <HI>Anacletus</HI> died whil&s;t St. <HI>Peter</HI> lived; and that <HI>Clemens</HI> was ordained their Succe&s;&s;or by St. <HI>Peter</HI> al&s;o. So that we have two or three Per&s;ons, by this Account, ordained &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively Bi&s;hops of <HI>Rome</HI> by the Hands of the Apo&s;tles.</Q></P>
<P>But to prevent impertinent wrangling, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve again, that when we &s;peak of the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, we mean no more than what he &s;ays every Body allows. I <HI>&s;uppo&s;e,</HI> &s;ays he, P. 82. <HI>every one will grant, that it was the Practice from the Times of the Apo&s;tles, for Mini&s;ters to ordain Mini&s;ters.</HI> And they who do other|wi&s;e, he &s;ays, are guilty of Sin and Di&s;order, and CHRIST <HI>will not own but condemn them.</HI></P>
<P>This is all we contend for, which yet he &s;ays, in us is the <HI>Height of Madne&s;s,</HI> P. 78. And yet our <HI>high</HI> and raving Madne&s;s is no wor&s;e than this, we believe that the Apo&s;tles ordained Succe&s;&s;ors, and they others to &s;uc|ceed them; and the &s;ame has been the Practice in every Age. So the Holy Scripture and the Hi&s;tory of all Places and Ages inform us; It is no Matter whether the&s;e Mini&s;ters were <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> or both; if they were Mini&s;ters of Ordination it will &s;atisfy the <HI>Height of</HI> our <HI>Madne&s;s.</HI> And it is no Matter whether we know for certain, who were ordained by the Apo&s;tles, &s;o long as we know they did ordain others, and this Cu&s;tom has always continued, as Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> affirms.
<PB N="38" REF="006637_0037_102971F9276B79F8">And thus we are agreed that there is a Succe&s;&s;ion and good Evidence of it, after all that he has &s;aid, to prove it <HI>the Height of Madne&s;s.</HI> What although <HI>Hi&s;torians</HI> differ about, who were fir&s;t ordained by the Apo&s;tles at <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;ince all are agreed that they did ordain Succe&s;&s;ors, and they others, and this has been the con&s;tant Practice in all Ages? He concludes his Di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion with this Remark, P. 82. <HI>There is,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>a va&s;tly greater Probability that the Pre&s;byterian Succe&s;&s;ion has been pre&s;erved entire and uninterrupted, than that the Epi&s;copal Succe&s;&s;ion has been &s;o. Several Things have oc|curred to my Thoughts while writing on this Subject, which fully convince me of this.</HI></P>
<P>This I confe&s;s is a new Di&s;covery; Di&s;&s;enters highe&s;t Ambition formerly was &s;atisfied with a Power equal to any Bi&s;hop in <HI>England;</HI> but Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has quite outdone all that ever went before him; by his hard Study and long <HI>Writing</HI> on this Subject, he has found out that the Di&s;&s;enters Power and Succe&s;&s;ion, though it is only from the Bi&s;hops, is va&s;tly <HI>clearer</HI> and more <HI>indi&s;putable</HI> than theirs.</P>
<P>But let us try this rare Paradox by the Te&s;t of com|mon Sen&s;e, and &s;ee if it be &s;olid. Does not he pretend that the Bi&s;hops of <HI>New-England</HI> had all their Power from the Bi&s;hops of the Church of <HI>England?</HI> How then came they by a va&s;tly better Claim than tho&s;e they &s;prang from? Why, he tells us, that their Succe&s;&s;ion as <HI>Pre&s;|byters is clear,</HI> but not their <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> as <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI> Well, but don't he affirm, that <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byter</HI> is one and the &s;ame? How then can one have a clearer Succe&s;&s;ion than the other? Be&s;ides, did the Bi&s;hops ordain tho&s;e Men who afterwards left the Church and turned <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters,</HI> in their Capacity, as they were <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time ordain tho&s;e who continued in the Church in their Capacity as they were <HI>Bi&s;hops?</HI> No certainly. If they ordained us as <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> then as they were <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> they ordained you too: If they ordained you, as they were <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> then as <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> they ordained us like|wi&s;e.
<PB N="39" REF="006637_0038_102971FD98837B70">There could be no Difference; &s;o that his rare Di&s;covery, the Fruit of much Study, turns out to be but a childi&s;h Jingle; and is more ea&s;ily confuted than ex|plained. However, we may ob&s;erve, that he allows, that the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Church of <HI>England</HI> as to our <HI>Pre&s;by|ters</HI> or <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> is <HI>clear</HI> and indi&s;putable. And he &s;ays, P. 85, that what he has &s;aid, <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hes that</HI> (Succe&s;&s;ion) <HI>in the Line of Pre&s;byters.</HI> So that we who are Pre&s;byters in the Church, are in the Line of Succe&s;&s;ion from the Apo&s;tles, our <HI>Enemies being Judges.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. We come now to the la&s;t Enquiry, which is, Whether the Mini&s;ters of the Pre&s;byterian or Indepen|dent Per&s;ua&s;ion in <HI>New England</HI> have Authority from CHRIST by Succe&s;&s;ion? And becau&s;e I would not have the Reader's Mind diverted from the main Que&s;tion, I &s;hall take no Notice of what he has &s;aid about the Prin|ciples and Practices of the fir&s;t Settlers of this Country, not becau&s;e I think his Account ju&s;t, but becau&s;e it does not concern the Controver&s;y. And to treat him with the utmo&s;t Fairne&s;s, I &s;hall grant him what he pleads for, that all the Lay Ordinations in the Country &s;hall not prejudice his Cau&s;e in the lea&s;t Degree, and that the fir&s;t Mini&s;ters in this Country were ordained by the Bi&s;hops of <HI>England.</HI> The only Que&s;tion now is, whether by Virtue of the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Ordination, they were inve&s;ted with a Power to ordain others? Upon this &s;ingle Point the whole Controver&s;y turns. For he grants, the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Succe&s;&s;ion, as I have already &s;hewed, and that this Succe&s;&s;ion is in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and claims a Power from CHRIST by Virtue of their <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Ordination in this Church. Here there|fore, let the Reader, who would make a true Judgment, carefully weigh the Rea&s;ons on both Sides. In my fir&s;t Vindication, as I con&s;idered all the Arguments on this Head, that I had ever heard or read, &s;o <HI>fir&s;t</HI> I took No|tice of Mr. <HI>Neals</HI>'s, and expre&s;t my&s;elf thus, <Q>You &s;a|tisfy your&s;elves with the Argument Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> has ad|vanced,
<PB N="40" REF="006637_0039_102971FF1E506FE0">who &s;ays, <HI>the Form of ordaining a Prie&s;t and a Bi&s;hop is the &s;ame.</HI> But I am &s;orry that I am obliged to tell you, there is no Truth in it. For they are two Forms, and as different as the Forms of or|daining a Prie&s;t and a Deacon.</Q> Now hear Mr. <HI>Ho|bart</HI>'s Reply to this, P. 103. He &s;ays, <Q>I can't leave this Subject, without taking Notice of the Inju&s;tice done to Mr. <HI>Neal,</HI> whom Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> charges with Fal&s;|hood.

Can you now believe, that Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> wrote under a Sen&s;e that his next An&s;wer might be to his eternal Judge.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has &s;o often reviled me for this &s;erious Expre&s;&s;ion, and repre&s;ented me, (as he owns) as being guilty of little le&s;s than Perjury, that if I &s;hould vin|dicate my Innocence in every In&s;tance, I mu&s;t write a Book as large as his, and yet neglect material Points. I de&s;ire herefore the candid Reader, by this one In&s;tance of my &s;uppo&s;ed Fal&s;hood, to judge of all the re&s;t. Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Friend in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> (I &s;uppo&s;e) has thought this &s;o material a Point, as to make a di&s;tinct Head of it,
<PB N="41" REF="006637_0040_10297200A3D81620">and put it in the Index thus, Mr. <HI>Neal vindicated again&s;t the Charge of Fal&s;hood.</HI> Let us &s;ee then, where the Fal&s;hood will fall. And here I need make no Defence but what Bi&s;hop <HI>Maddox</HI> has made for me in his An|&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Neal,</HI> P. 57. He having &s;hewn that the three Orders had obtained from the begining, and uni|ver&s;ally in the Chri&s;tian Church, then &s;ays; <Q>Notwith|&s;tanding all this, Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> is extreamly fond of a Parity among the Clergy, and has taken <HI>too much</HI> Pains in that Cau&s;e.

<P>And here, (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Neal,) "it is ob&s;ervable that the Form of ordaining a Prie&s;t, and a Bi&s;hop IS THE SAME.</HI> Again &s;ays he, <HI>our Reformers admitted but two Orders of Church Officers to be Divine Appoint|ment, viz.

<P>Mr. <HI>Neal</HI>'s A&s;&s;ertion is in the&s;e Words, <HI>The fir&s;t Reformers believed BUT TWO Orders of Church Men in Holy Scripture, viz.

<P>Without &s;topping for one Reflection, let us go on to his next A&s;&s;ertion, which runs thus;</P>
<P><HI>The Form of ordaining a Prie&s;t and a Bi&s;hop is the &s;ame?</HI></P>
<P>Here we have Recour&s;e to the &s;ame Ordinal, and find therein two Forms, one for the <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> and the other for the Bi&s;hop, as di&s;tinct from each other as the Forms of a <HI>Deacon</HI> and a <HI>Prie&s;t.</HI> The Title of the one Form is, <HI>The Form of ordaining of Prie&s;ts;</HI> the Title of the other is, <HI>The Form of Con&s;ecration of an Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hop.</HI> Perhaps Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> means, that the very Form of Ordination and Con&s;e|cration, tho&s;e <HI>individual Words,</HI> by which they are or|dained and con&s;ecrated, are the &s;ame. But neither is this the Ca&s;e. The Form for the Prie&s;t is as fol|lows. <HI>When this Prayer is done, the Bi&s;hop with the Prie&s;ts pre&s;ent, &s;hall lay their Hands &s;everally upon the Head of every one that receiveth Orders, the Receivers humbly kneeling upon their Knees, and the Bi&s;hop &s;aying,</HI> Receive the Holy Gho&s;t: Who&s;e Sins thou do&s;t for|give, they are forgiven: And who&s;e Sins thou do&s;t retain, they are retained; and be thou a faithful Di&s;|pen&s;er of the Word of GOD, and of his Holy Sacra|ments: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t. &mdash; <HI>The Bi&s;hop &s;hall deliver to every one of them, the Bible in his Hand, &s;aying,</HI> Take thou Authority to preach the Word of GOD, and to Mini&s;ter the Holy Sacraments in the Congre|gation where thou &s;halt be &s;o appointed.</P>
<P>The Form of con&s;ecrating and Arch Bi&s;hop, or Bi|&s;hop is this. <HI>Then the Arch-Bi&s;hop and Bi&s;hops pre&s;ent, &s;hall lay their Hands upon the Head of the Elect Bi&s;hop, the Arch-Bi&s;hop, &s;aying,</HI> Take the Holy Gho&s;t, and remember that thou &s;tir up the Grace of GOD which is in thee, by Impo&s;ition of Hands; for GOD hath not given the Spirit of Fear, but of Power and Love,

<P>The&s;e are the Forms of ordaining a Bi&s;hop and a Prie&s;t, which are called the SAME. The Weight of thus mi&s;repre&s;enting a publick Ordinal, falls wholly upon Mr. <HI>Neal."</HI> "The old <HI>Puritans</HI> complained, that the <HI>Prie&s;t receiveth in his Ordination no Authority to govern the Flock, but only to preach the Word and Admini&s;ter the Sacraments.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing, &s;ure, but the Impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting his Scheme, and proving the Parity of Pre&s;byters and Bi&s;hops, any other Way, could have put Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> upon this Method of attempting it. He had indeed undertaken a difficult Ta&s;k, and mu&s;t therefore have great Allowances in the Execution of it. The Sen&s;e and Practice of the whole Chri&s;tian Church for fifteen hundred Years, in a Form of Church Government, &s;o early, &s;o univer&s;ally, &s;o con&s;tantly received, were great Ob&s;tacles. No In&s;tances of Pre&s;byters executing the di&s;tingui&s;hing Offices of a Bi&s;hop. No Example of a Man's being a Bi&s;hop one Day, and reduced to a mere Pre&s;byter the next, as mu&s;t have been the Ca&s;e, had a Bi&s;hop, as is &s;ometimes alledged, been no more than a <HI>Chair Man,</HI> a Moderator, or temporary

Since Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> [and Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> after him] has thought fit to intro|duce the Reformers as Patrons of this Notion, of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> being the &s;ame, it may not be im|proper to lay before the Reader Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI>'s Ac|count of the Authors of that Opinion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hi&s;t. R. V.</HI> 1. P. 366.</NOTE> In the an|cient Church they knew none of the&s;e Subtilties which were found out in the latter Ages. 'Twas then thought enough that a Bi&s;hop was to be dedicated to his Function by a <HI>new</HI> Impo&s;ition of Hands, and that &s;everal Offices could not be performed without Bi|&s;hops; &s;uch as Ordination, Confirmation, &amp;c. But they did not refine in the&s;e Matters, &s;o much as to enquire whether Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts differed in Order and Office, or only in degree. But after the <HI>School|men</HI> fell to examine Matters of Divinity with logical and unintelligible Niceties, and the <HI>Canoni&s;ts</HI> began to comment upon the Rules of the ancient Church, they &s;tudied to make <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> &s;eem very <HI>near</HI> one another; &s;o that the Difference was but &s;mall. They
<PB N="45" REF="006637_0044_1029720D08BA67D0">did it with different De&s;igns. The <HI>Schoolmen</HI> having &s;et up the grand My&s;tery of <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> were to exalt the Prie&s;tly Office as much as was po&s;&s;ible; for the turning the Ho&s;t into GOD, was &s;o great an Action, that they reckoned that there could be no Office higher than that which qualified a Man to &s;o mighty a Performance: Therefore as they changed the Form of Ordination from what it was anciently believed to con&s;i&s;t in, to a delivering the &s;acred Ve&s;&s;els, and held that a Prie&s;t had his Orders by that Rite, and not by the <HI>Impo&s;ition</HI> of Hands; &s;o they rai&s;ed their Order or Office &s;o high as to make it equal with the Order of a Bi&s;hop; but as they de&s;igned to extol the Order of Prie&s;thood, &s;o the <HI>Canoni&s;ts</HI> had as great a Mind to depre&s;s the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Order. They generally wrote for Preferment; and the Way to it was to exalt the <HI>Papacy.</HI> Nothing could do that &s;o effectually, as to bring down the Power of Bi&s;hops. This only could ju&s;tify the Exemptions of the <HI>Monks</HI> and <HI>Fryars,</HI> &amp;c. All which were unlawful, if the Bi|&s;hops had by Divine Right, Juri&s;diction in their Dioce&s;es; therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to lay them as low as could be, and to make them think, that the Power they held, was rather as Delegates of tha A|po&s;tolick See, than by a Commi&s;&s;ion from CHRIST or his Apo&s;tles; &s;o that they looked on the declaring <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Authority to be of <HI>Divine Right</HI> as a Blow that would be <HI>fatal</HI> to the <HI>Court of Rome;</HI> and there|fore they did after this at <HI>Trent</HI> u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Endea|vours to hinder any &s;uch Deci&s;ion: It having been then the common Stile of that Age to reckon Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts as the &s;ame Office, it is no Wonder if at this Time the Clergy of this Church, the greate&s;t Part of them being &s;till leaven'd with the old Super&s;tition, and the re&s;t of them not having Time enough to exa|mine le&s;&s;er Matters, retained &s;till the former Phra&s;es in this particular. On this I have in&s;i&s;ted the more, that it may appear how little they have con&s;idered Things
<PB N="46" REF="006637_0045_102972100939A9F0">who are &s;o far carried with their <HI>Zeal again&s;t</HI> the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Government of this Church, as to make much U&s;e of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>Schoolmen</HI> and <HI>Canoni&s;ts</HI> that deny them to be di&s;tinct Offices; For the&s;e are the <HI>very Dregs of Popery;</HI> the one rai&s;ing the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> higher for the &s;ake of <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation;</HI> the other pulling down the Bi&s;hops lower for the &s;ake of the Pope's <HI>Supremacy;</HI> and by &s;uch Means bringing them almo&s;t to an Equality. So partial are &s;ome Men to their particular Conceits that they make U&s;e of the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous Topicks, when they can &s;erve their Turn, not con&s;idering how much further the&s;e Argu|ments will run, if they ever admit them. Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> imputes the&s;e Sentiments of &s;ome in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to the Reformers under King <HI>Ed|ward</HI> VI, though in the Preface to their Ordinal they expre&s;ly declare the <HI>contrary.</HI>"</P>
<P>And now I leave it with the Reader, who are guilty of the Fal&s;hood, we who &s;ay that one and one make two, or Mr. <HI>Neal,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hobart,</HI> and his Friend in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> who affirm that two di&s;tinct Offices are one and the <HI>&s;ame? It is a &s;tubborn Matter of Fact, which will not bend to Men's Humours.</HI> Every one may &s;ee that as the&s;e Forms are <HI>two now,</HI> &s;o they were in King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Time. Seeing then after a Man is ordained <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> he mu&s;t be ordained anew, and by a di&s;tinct Form, in order to receive the Power of Ordination, it is certain that tho&s;e mere <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> who came into <HI>New England</HI> and &s;et up the Bu&s;ine&s;s of ordaining here, acted without any Authority received by their Ordination: Con&s;equently the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try which &s;prang from them, have no Authority by Suc|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s other Argument, which is taken from there being but one Commi&s;&s;ion in the holy Scripture. He &s;ays, P. 99. <HI>If there be but one Order,</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byters have Authority from</HI> CHRIST, (as I allow,) which they cannot have, unle&s;s CHRIST'S (Com|mi&s;&s;ion belongs to them, and if it belongs to them <HI>at all,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="006637_0046_10297215F04EA360">they mu&s;t have <HI>all</HI> the Authority contained in it. <HI>That GOD has joined, Men cannot &s;eparate.</HI> P. 100. This Ar|gument contains the Strength of their whole Cau&s;e, and is to them like <HI>Sam&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Locks,</HI> I &s;hall therefore carefully re-examine it, although I had an&s;wered it before.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not true, that if a Man has <HI>Part</HI> of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try he mu&s;t have all. A <HI>Deacon</HI> in the Church has a <HI>Part</HI> of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, but not the whole, the Expre&s;&s;ions in ordaining a <HI>Deacon,</HI> are <HI>&s;ufficiently de&s;crip|tive of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try,</HI> yet the whole Power that CHRIST has annext to the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try no more be|longs to a <HI>Deacon,</HI> than to a Lay-man. A Deacon is expre&s;ly empowered to preach, to baptize, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Admini&s;tration of the Lord's Supper. Now if Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Argument be good, a Deacon has the whole Apo&s;tolick Commi&s;&s;ion, and as much Authority to or|dain as any Bi&s;hop in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>To this he makes no Reply.</P>
<P>Again, the twelve Apo&s;tles before CHRIST'S Re&s;ur|rection, had a <HI>Part,</HI> but not the whole of the Mini&s;try: They had Power to preach, baptize and admini&s;ter the Lord's Supper, yet CHRIST kept the Power of Ordina|tion in his own Hands, and never committed it to them till ju&s;t before his final A&s;cention; when he &s;aid, <HI>as my Father &s;ent me, &s;o &s;end I you. Judas</HI> had received <HI>Part</HI> of the Mini&s;try, but never the whole of it. <HI>Acts</HI> i. 17. <HI>For he was numbred with us, and had obtained part of this Mini&s;try.</HI> It will not do, to &s;ay this was not the Go&s;|pel Mini&s;try, for here St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ays expre&s;ly, it was PART of that very Mini&s;try which they had after CHRIST'S A&s;cention; yet <HI>Judas</HI> never had the Power of Ordination. I grant, <HI>Men cannot</HI> lawfully <HI>&s;eparate what GOD has joined.</HI> But then GOD never has &s;o joined the whole of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, as that a Man can't have a <HI>Part</HI> withouth the <HI>whole.</HI> Where, when, did GOD &s;ay, "He that has a <HI>Part</HI> &s;hall have <HI>all.</HI>" Prov, xxx. 6. <HI>Add thou not unto his Words, le&s;t he reprove thee, and thou be found a Liar.</HI> A Man may be impower'd to preach,
<PB N="48" REF="006637_0047_10297218E832B5E0">or to baptize, and yet have no more of the Apo&s;tolick Commi&s;&s;ion as the Deacons had: We read <HI>Acts</HI> x. 48. When by St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Preaching, a great Number were converted, <HI>he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the</HI> LORD. Now it is mo&s;t probable, that the Per&s;ons whom he commanded to baptize the&s;e new Converts, were the Lay-Brethren who had accompanied him from <HI>Joppa.</HI> v. 23. By this Command they were <HI>authorized</HI> to baptize the&s;e Per&s;ons, and yet they had no Authority to preach, much le&s;s to ordain, nay, after this Service was over, they were as ab&s;olute Lay-men as any at all. So when three thou&s;and were converted and baptized in one Day, it is mo&s;t likely that more Hands were employed in it, than the Apo&s;tles, St. <HI>Paul</HI> baptized but <HI>few</HI> of tho&s;e whom he converted. He was not &s;ent <HI>to baptize, but to preach.</HI> So that it is mo&s;t probable that his Con|verts were chiefly baptized by Per&s;ons impower'd by his Command to do it.</P>
<P>But whether this was really the Ca&s;e, or not, it can't be denied but that they might take this Method; and then it is certain they could give <HI>Part,</HI> without giving the whole of their Authority. Nay Di&s;&s;enters do certainly undertake to give a <HI>Part</HI> of the Mini&s;try without giving the <HI>whole of</HI> it. It is a univer&s;al Cu&s;tom among them to examine <HI>Candidates,</HI> and when they approve of them, they &s;end them to preach the Go&s;pel, in <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> of which they give them a written In&s;trument &s;igned by their Mini&s;ters. Now this <HI>Right, Liberty</HI> or <HI>Power</HI> to preach the Go&s;pel is a <HI>Part</HI> of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try or A|po&s;tolick Commi&s;&s;ion. And though in this Ca&s;e they do not commonly u&s;e the Rite or Ceremony of <HI>Impo&s;ition</HI> of <HI>Hands,</HI> yet this does not hinder, but that they have as good Authority to preach, as if their Hands had been laid on them. And Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> is clear in it, that Im|po&s;ition of Hands is not nece&s;&s;ary to convey the Mini|&s;terial Authority, but if they who appoint a Man to the Mini&s;try, do but &s;ignify this their Appointment any other way it is &s;ufficient. <HI>No body,</HI> (&s;ays he), <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e,
<PB N="49" REF="006637_0048_1029721A6DD01A88">upon Mini&s;terial Authority as &s;uch</HI> a phy&s;ical Quality, <HI>as is communicable only by</HI> Contact, fir&s;t Ad. P. 114. So that as often as the Presbyterian Mini&s;ters approve and &s;end a Man only to preach, they do really undertake to give a <HI>Part</HI> of the Mini&s;try without the <HI>whole.</HI> And by a <HI>Certificate</HI> &s;igned by their Hands, they impower him, as effectually as if their Hands had been laid on his Head. Suppo&s;e then, that a Number of the&s;e <HI>licen|&s;ed</HI> Preachers &s;hould take upon them to ordain others, would you not call them Sons of <HI>Korah</HI> and U&s;urpers? Yet they could defend them&s;elves with the &s;ame Ar|gument that <HI>New-England</HI> Mini&s;ters u&s;e. They could &s;ay, <Q>we were appointed to preach the Go&s;pel, which is a <HI>Part</HI> of the Apo&s;tolick Commi&s;&s;ion or Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, and we can't have <HI>Part</HI> without having the <HI>whole.</HI> There is but one Commi&s;&s;ion, and it can't be <HI>divided,</HI> he that has any <HI>Part</HI> of it, mu&s;t have <HI>all.</HI> If there is but one <HI>Order,</HI> we are of that Order, and &s;o mu&s;t be equal to tho&s;e who appointed us to preach.</Q></P>
<P>Will you now tell the&s;e Preachers, that they want Impo&s;ition of Hands? they can tell you as Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> does, <Q>that is only a Point of Order, but is not <HI>e&s;&s;en|tial</HI> to the mini&s;terial <HI>Character,</HI> and all allow <HI>phy&s;i|cal Contact is not nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></Q> Will you tell the&s;e <HI>mere</HI> Preachers, that they who appointed them to Preach, never intended to give them Power to ordain? The &s;ame we &s;ay to you with Regard to tho&s;e <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> who fir&s;t &s;et up <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ordination in this Country, the Bi&s;hops who ordained them, never intended to qualify them to ordain others, and they them&s;elves vowed they would never do any &s;uch Thing; which rendered them le&s;s qualified to ordain than ab&s;olute Lay-Men. Let us now proceed one &s;tep further, &s;uppo&s;e your Mini|&s;ters after having examined and approved of a Candi|date <HI>to go and preach</HI> the Go&s;pel, &s;hould not only pray for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon this his Undertaking, as I hope they do, but &s;hould al&s;o u&s;e the Rite of <HI>Impo&s;ition of Hands.</HI> I ask now, whether this does not make him
<PB N="50" REF="006637_0049_1029721D6818F808">a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, as far as Preaching goes? Certainly it does. Again, I de&s;ire to know why you may not, in &s;ending forth a Man to Preach, u&s;e the Rite of laying on of Hands, as well as that of &s;igning a <HI>Certificate</HI> to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e? The only Difference is, the one is &s;criptural, and the other is not. If then &s;uch a Thing can be done, then the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try may be divided, and a Man may have a <HI>Part,</HI> and not the <HI>whole.</HI> And if it can be done as the Di&s;&s;enters con&s;tant Practice &s;hews that they think it <HI>can;</HI> then it is really done in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and Prie&s;ts have a Part of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, and not the Power of Ordination. And that &s;et of <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> who came into <HI>New-England,</HI> and ordained the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and <HI>Inde|pendent</HI> Bi&s;hops, had no better Warrant for this, than the <HI>probationary</HI> Preachers among the Di&s;&s;enters have to ordain others to the whole Go&s;pel Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>In the <HI>New-England</HI> Churches there are as really three di&s;tinct Orders; as in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in &s;ome Churches there are Deacons ordained to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the admini&s;tring the holy Sacrament, to pray in the Congregation, e&s;pecially in the Mini&s;ter's Ab&s;ence, &amp;c. There is a &s;econd Order &s;ent forth merely to preach and pray, the&s;e of the &s;econd Order are as fully <HI>au|thorized</HI> to that Part of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, as they can be by tho&s;e who &s;end them: for <HI>phy&s;ical Contact</HI> is not e&s;&s;ential, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Hobart.</HI> The highe&s;t Order is their Bi&s;hops who claim the <HI>&s;ole</HI> Power of Ordination, and &s;o exclude both the Inferior Orders from any &s;hare in this Office. So that for my Part, I have no diffi|culty to join with them upon the Score of three Orders, all I fear is that none of their Orders have any Mi&s;&s;ion from CHRIST.</P>
<P>Appointing a Man to preach the Go&s;pel is really or|daining him, whether it be done by a written In&s;tru|ment, as the Di&s;&s;enters do, or by Impo&s;ition of Hands, as our Bi&s;hops do, it alters not the Ca&s;e. If a Bi&s;hop &s;hould upon examining a Man, approve of him to go and preach the Go&s;pel, and give him a <HI>Te&s;timonial</HI> of
<PB N="51" REF="006637_0050_10297221D57558E0">this his appointing him to that Work, &s;igned by his own Hand, as the Di&s;&s;enters do, this Man would no longer be a mere Lay-man, but as really a Mini&s;ter of GOD's Word, as the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf, and yet be no Mini&s;ter of the Sacraments, nor of Ordination. In a Word, the Argument can not be evaded, turn it over and over, view it on which &s;ide you plea&s;e, it proves that the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try can be, and is divided, Men can, and do receive a <HI>Part</HI> without the <HI>whole.</HI> And therefore the great Argument to defend the Lawfulne&s;s of the <HI>New-England</HI> Mini&s;try is certainly a Mi&s;take. <HI>Stubborn Matters of Fact,</HI> confute it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Mi&s;take in his Argument is, that every Mini&s;ter to the End of the World mu&s;t have that very <HI>individual</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion which CHRIST gave to the A|po&s;tles, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxviii. 20. Whereas really what he calls the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> is nothing more than the Account or Hi&s;tory of their la&s;t Ordination: And is the Com|mi&s;&s;ion of no Man now living. Every Mini&s;ter's Commi&s;&s;ion is given at his Ordination, and the Words and &s;ignificant Signs then u&s;ed, &s;hew what his Com|mi&s;&s;ion is. And yet,</P>
<P N="3">3. It does not follow, as he imagines, that we are no Mini&s;ters of CHRIST; becau&s;e our Commi&s;&s;ion is not to be found in the Bible. For that Man who is or|dained or &s;ent to perform any Part of the Go&s;pel Mi|ni&s;try by &s;uch as have CHRIST'S Authority to &s;end him, is &s;o far CHRIST'S Mini&s;ter, and has his Authority.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Office of a Prie&s;t in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> according to Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> is no Office of CHRIST'S Ap|pointment: As it is de&s;cribed in the Book of Ordina|tion, it is inferior to that of a Bi&s;hop. And Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;ays, P. 52. that the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> are but the <HI>Bi&s;hops Sub&s;titutes</HI> or <HI>Curates in&s;tead of being</HI> CHRIST'S <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI> And therefore his &s;uppo&s;ing that CHRIST has in the holy Scripture annext the Power of Ordination to this Office, is certainly vain and groundle&s;s, and therefore tho&s;e <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> who came into this Country, and ordain|ed the <HI>New-England</HI> Mini&s;ters clearly and certainly, had

<P>Nay, Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that they by Vertue of their <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Ordination had not Authority &s;o much as to Preach, how much le&s;s to ordain Bi&s;hops? It is certain, if neither CHRIST nor his Apo&s;tles in&s;ti|tuted more than one Order of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, then the Order of <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> is only of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical In&s;titution; and CHRIST has not annext the Power of Ordination to this merely human Appointment. So that according to Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Principles, it is demon&s;trable that the <HI>New-England</HI> Bi&s;hops have no Authority from CHRIST by Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>What he &s;ays about a Con&s;table's being ignorant of the extent of his Power, when fir&s;t put into his Office, is nothing to the Purpo&s;e: becau&s;e the Law di&s;covers that. But the Go&s;pel as it makes no Mention of the In&s;titution of this Order of <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> &s;o it is perfectly &s;ilent about any Power of Ordination annext to it.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of an <HI>Antipedobapti&s;ts</HI> covenanting not to baptize Infants, is not a Parallel, becau&s;e he is &s;uppo|&s;ed to have Power to baptize, and he who can baptize, may lawfully baptize any who are the proper Subjects of Bapti&s;m. But the Prie&s;t in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> receives not Power to ordain any at all; as I before demon&s;trated, and the old <HI>Puritans</HI> complained. Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> tells us how compa&s;&s;ionately concern'd he is for &s;ome good People, who ask him what they &s;hall do, when we who &s;hould be Guides differ &s;o widely? Now I would advi&s;e &s;uch &s;erious Per&s;ons to put on the &s;ame Temper of Mind, as if they were under Oath to &s;erve on the <HI>Jury</HI> to decide a Controver&s;y about an E&s;tate. The Ca&s;e you are to try, is this, whether tho&s;e <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who came into this Country, and &s;et up the <HI>New-England</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, had Authority to ordain? Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;ays they had: We think they had not. We plead, that if a Man re|ceiving <HI>Prie&s;t</HI>'s Orders, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to receive Au|thority
<PB N="53" REF="006637_0052_10297226589DC9D0">to ordain Bi&s;hops, he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to re|ceive this Authority, not only without any Word, or Sign which does expre&s;s it, not only without any &s;uch In|tention in the Church, or in the Bi&s;hop ordaining, or la&s;tly in him&s;elf, but even again&s;t the Will and Intention of the Church, again&s;t the Will and Intention of the Ordainer, nay again&s;t his own Re&s;olution, decla|red in a &s;olemn Vow at the Time of his Ordination. And you know no Title to Land or E&s;tate is ever &s;o convey'd. This Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> does not deny; but acknowledges it looks like Demon&s;tration, and he him&s;elf &s;ays a great deal more to prove that it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould have received Power to ordain by Virtue of their Epi&s;copal Ordination: for &s;ays he, that Ordination don't give them &s;o much as Power to <HI>preach,</HI> and they were only the <HI>Bi&s;hops Sub&s;titutes</HI> and <HI>Curates,</HI> and if &s;o, it is im|po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould be Bi&s;hops them&s;elves, and have Power to ordain.</P>
<P>But now he pleads, that though the&s;e <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> were &s;o ignorant of the Extent of that Office at the Time of their being ordained to it, that they tied their own Hands by Vows not to act as Bi&s;hops, yet &s;eeing CHRIST in the Go&s;pel has annext the Power of Ordination to it, they had therefore good right to u&s;e tho&s;e Powers which at fir&s;t they did not under&s;tand to belong to their Office.</P>
<P>And though at fir&s;t they did not know that they had the Power of Ordination, yet if CHRIST has annext the Power of Ordination to their Office, they had good Right to u&s;e it, their former Ignorance and Vows notwith&s;tand|ing. Upon this Plea his whole Cau&s;e depends.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, the Office or Commi&s;&s;ion, into which the&s;e <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> had been introduced is not recorded in the Scripture.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This Paragraph is not &s;o to be under&s;tood as tho' the Commi&s;|&s;ion of Prie&s;ts is not comprehended in the Apo&s;tolick Commi&s;&s;ion, for that it virtually is, and con&s;equently is in the New-Te&s;tament, being a part of the Power therein given to the Apo&s;tles: And it manife&s;tly appears, that they had a Right (and &s;o their Succe&s;&s;ors in the whole of their Commi&s;&s;ion) to convey Part of their Power to a &s;ubordinate Officer, &s;uch as is now called a <HI>Prie&s;t.</HI> For it is evident, that under the infallible Guidance of the Spirit of GOD they did ordain to that &s;ubordinate Office to admini&s;ter the Word and Sacraments without the Power of Ordination. For it appears in the New-Te&s;tament, that in &s;everal Churches there were &s;uch inferior Officers, over which the Apo&s;tles notwith&s;tanding, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to appoint one to pre|&s;ide in the whole Commi&s;&s;ion granted to them, who be&s;ides the Power of admini&s;tring the Word and Sacraments, had the Power of pre&s;iding in Government, and granting either <HI>plenary</HI> or <HI>partial</HI> Commi&s;&s;ions to others. And that &s;uch &s;ubordinate Officers did obtain throughout the Chri&s;tian Church, agreeable to holy Scripture, is an evident Fact from all ancient Writers atte&s;ting it with one Con&s;ent; and never has or can be di&s;proved by any of our Adver&s;aries.</NOTE> Therefore no Powers are there annext
<PB N="54" REF="006637_0053_102972282C7443A8" MS="y">to it. It is true, that he who would know the Extent of any civil Officer's Power mu&s;t not judge of it by the Mi&s;takes of the Officer at the Time of his being put into that Office, but by what Power the Law has annext to his Office. So he who would know whether the Power of Ordination belongs to that Office, called the Office of a <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> he mu&s;t judge of it by the Commi&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, but this Commi&s;&s;ion is no where to be found in the Scripture. The <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> all &s;ay, no &s;uch Office is to be found in the New Te&s;tament, and we grant that our Commi&s;&s;ion is not there, and therefore certainly no Power of Ordination is annext to it in Scripture. But he who would know what Powers we have, mu&s;t con&s;ult the Book of Ordination, where our Commi&s;&s;ion is to be &s;een, and there he will find no Power of Ordination is annext to our Office: but the contrary fully declared.</P>
<P>If now Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;hould &s;ay, (for I know not what el&s;e he can &s;ay,) if the Ca&s;e be &s;o, that our Commi&s;&s;ion is not to be found in the Go&s;pel, then we are not CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters. I an&s;wer, this does not follow, for as I &s;aid before he who is ordained to any Part of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try by &s;uch as have Power from CHRIST, is CHRIST'S Mini&s;ter. It is a groundle&s;s Imagination, that none are CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters, unle&s;s their Commi&s;&s;ion is recorded in the Go&s;pel. They who have Authority to act in
<PB N="55" REF="006637_0054_1029722E2B3C4490">CHRIST'S Name, are as really his Amba&s;&s;adors, as if their Ordination had been recorded in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Let me &s;uppo&s;e, that we who have had <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Or|dination, &s;hould be convinced by Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Rea|&s;oning, that our Subordination and Subjection to our Bi&s;hops, is that &s;ervile <HI>calling Men Ma&s;ter,</HI> which our LORD has forbidden, and &s;hould take it into our Heads to ordain others, and declare &s;uch to be as good Bi&s;hops and have as much Authority as any in <HI>England,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time &s;hould not fall in with Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Party, but join with the New-Lights (whom he <HI>&s;neer|ingly</HI> calls our <HI>Brethren</HI>) I would fain know, whether it is not very likely, that he would condemn us as guilty of the greate&s;t Wickedne&s;s, calls us all Sons of <HI>Korah,</HI> and perjured <HI>U&s;urpers?</HI> Be &s;ure every indiffer|ent Judge, mu&s;t condemn it with abhorrence. And I'm &s;ure I &s;hould enter upon &s;uch a Cour&s;e with as much Horror in my Con&s;cience as I &s;hould engage in a Cour&s;e of Adultery. Yet this was exactly the Ca&s;e of the fir&s;t Sett of Mini&s;ters who began the <HI>New-England</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, they had exactly the &s;ame Ordina|tion as we; without one Word's Variation, they had made the &s;ame Vows of Subjection to their Superiors, they never had received a Power to ordain either ex|plicitly or implicitly by Words or Signs; yet they pre|&s;umed to ordain Bi&s;hops, and give an Authority which they them&s;elves had never received. Such a &s;hocking Pre&s;umption this was, that all Church Hi&s;tory for fifteen hundred Years don't afford any In&s;tance like it. In &s;aying this, I would not in&s;inuate, that the&s;e <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> though guilty of U&s;urpation, were all wicked Men and lo&s;t; I will not &s;ay of them as Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> does of the <HI>New-Light</HI> Mini&s;ters, that CHRIST will <HI>condemn them.</HI> I e&s;teem the Memory of &s;ome of them for their reli|gious Zeal. But at the &s;ame Time I dete&s;t that U&s;ur|pation, and believe that in me it would be the Sin of <HI>Korah,</HI> and we &s;hould not imitate even good Men in any <HI>bad</HI> Action.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> very much mi&s;repre&s;ents the Ca&s;e, when
<PB N="56" REF="006637_0055_1029723126135850">he &s;o often pretends that we join with the Church of <HI>England</HI> merely to get rid of <HI>di&s;puted</HI> Ordination, but don't mend the Matter by coming into the Church. No, no, this is not the Ca&s;e, we chu&s;e Ordination by the Bi&s;hops, becau&s;e no Rea&s;on can be offered, why we &s;hould doubt of its Validity. And we dare not ven|ture upon your Ordination, becau&s;e we think we can demon&s;trate that it is the Fruit of U&s;urpation. We don't &s;ay to you, as you do to us, who knows but that &s;ome Time or other, there has been &s;ome &s;ecret Flaws in your Line of Succe&s;&s;ion, which are now known only to GOD? No, but we point out to you the Time, and &s;hew you how you &s;et up without any Mi&s;&s;ion from CHRIST, either mediate or immediate. We freely ac|knowledge from that Time, your Succe&s;&s;ion is uninter|rupted, though you have no <HI>Regi&s;ters</HI> to &s;hew; and &s;ome Lay-Ordinations have not &s;poiled your Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, but it is ju&s;t as good now as when you began. And in chu&s;ing <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Ordination we venture no|thing; for if your's be as good as can be, it cannot be better than the Bi&s;hops, from whom you &s;ay, you had it. If we are prejudiced and bia&s;t in this Affair, it mu&s;t be a very &s;trange Piece of Self-denial that blinds us; For it is natural to all Men, to love Power and Great|ne&s;s; and can any Man think, that we had not rather be as <HI>high</HI> in Power and Authority as any Bi&s;hop in <HI>England,</HI> as your Principle would make us, than to be only the Bi&s;hop's <HI>Curate</HI> and <HI>Sub&s;titute?</HI> Who had not rather think that he has Power to ordain, and act inde|pendently, than to be in Subordination, provided the Evidence were equal on both Sides? But the Evidence again&s;t our bing really Bi&s;hops, (as you would make us) is &s;o clear and full, that we think nothing but the Pride of <HI>Korah,</HI> can hinder our &s;eeing it. And if we are not Bi&s;hops, it is certain the&s;e Mini&s;ters are nothing, that is, they have no Authority by Succe&s;&s;ion, for we have the &s;ame Authority as they had, who fir&s;t ordained the <HI>New-England</HI> Mini&s;ters. If they were real Bi&s;hops, &s;o are we; if we have not the Power of Ordination, it is
<PB N="57" REF="006637_0056_10297232EFB21D10">certain they had it not. And if they had it not, their Succe&s;&s;ors have none. In a Word, Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> and Brethren can't prove them&s;elves <HI>lawful</HI> Mini&s;ters, with|out proving us to be <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> at the &s;ame Time. And who can think we &s;hould not be glad to &s;ee that Point well proved?</P>
<P>As I know that I am liable to Mi&s;takes, &s;o I endeavour always to keep my Ears open, and be di&s;po&s;ed to re|ceive Truth from any Per&s;on, and I &s;hould not have been a&s;ham'd or unwilling to have changed my Opini|on once more, could I have &s;een Rea&s;on for it. Upon &s;evral Accounts I &s;hould have been very glad, to be convinced, that I may go &s;afe to Heaven in the Di&s;|&s;enting Way. I grant, that what he &s;ays, is true, that if we would all become Di&s;&s;enters it would &s;ave a great deal of Money: Be&s;ides, it would &s;ave Candidates for the Mini&s;try the Charge and Danger of a Voyage, in which &s;everal have lo&s;t their Lives already, it would pre&s;erve us from much Obloquy and Reproach ca&s;t upon us by Rea&s;on of our Conformity to the Church of <HI>England:</HI> were it not for which, we might have as much Re&s;pect and Honour as others: whereas now our <HI>Names are ca&s;t out as evil,</HI> and we have <HI>the Tryal of cruel Mockings,</HI> and are treated as the <HI>Off-&s;couring of all Things,</HI> and have almo&s;t <HI>all manner of Evil &s;aid of us</HI> fal&s;ly for Con&s;cience Sake: &s;o that a Man that values his Reputation, had need have in &s;ome Degree the Spirit of a Martyr, ar at lea&s;t of Confe&s;&s;or, in order to become a Churchman.</P>
<P>But then on the other Hand, I am obliged to con&s;ider, that if I turn Di&s;&s;enter, be&s;ides other Evils, I mu&s;t a&s;|&s;ume the Office of a Bi&s;hop and ordain, which in me would be a <HI>taking GOD's Name in vain,</HI> and a lying in CHRIST'S Name, &s;aying that he has &s;ent me to ordain, when I know he has not. And I mu&s;t <HI>countenance and own</HI> tho&s;e who do &s;o: While tho&s;e Words &s;ound aw|fully in my Ears, <HI>Numb.</HI> xvi. 40. <HI>That he be not as</HI> Ko|rah <HI>and his Company.</HI> If I had lived among the Suc|ce&s;&s;ors of <HI>Jonathan, Micah's Prie&s;t,</HI> I'm &s;ure it would
<PB N="58" REF="006637_0057_1029723483BA3170">have been my Duty to have &s;eparated from them, al|though they had as <HI>&s;ignal</HI> Ble&s;&s;ings, and as long Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion to &s;hew for their U&s;urpation, as the <HI>New-England</HI> Mini&s;ters have. I often reflect on the Ca&s;e of <HI>Saul,</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the divine Or|der, pleaded his pious Intentions and the Nece&s;&s;ity he was under, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xiii. 9. 12. <HI>Therefore &s;aid I, the Phi|li&s;tines will come down now upon me from Gilgal, and I have not made Supplication unto the</HI> LORD; <HI>I forced my&s;elf therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</HI> If ever the Plea of Nece&s;&s;ity, and Zeal for Wor&s;hipping GOD, could excu&s;e the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing GOD's Method and Order, certainly <HI>Saul</HI> mu&s;t have been ju&s;tified in what he had done. For he <HI>forced</HI> him&s;elf to it out of an earne&s;t De&s;ire to recommend him&s;elf to GOD's Protection in &s;o eminent a Danger. He would have been glad with all his Soul to have complied punctually with GOD's Rule.</P>
<P>Now hear <HI>Samuel</HI>'s An&s;wer to this Plea of Nece&s;&s;ity. ver. 13. And <HI>Samuel &s;aid unto Saul, thou ha&s;t done fool|i&s;hly: thou ha&s;t not kept the Commandment of the</HI> LORD <HI>thy GOD, which he commanded thee, now thy Kingdom &s;hall not continue.</HI> And again upon the like Occa&s;ion, he &s;ays to him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xi. 22. <HI>Hath the</HI> LORD <HI>as great De|light in burnt Offerings and Sacrifices, as in obeying the Voice of the</HI> LORD? <HI>Behold to obey, is better than Sacrifice; and to hearken, than the Fat of Rams. For Rebellion is as the Sin of Witchcraft, and Stubbornne&s;s is as Iniquity and Idolatry.</HI> Now Sacrifices and burnt Offerings were then po&s;itive In&s;titutions, as Ordination and the Sacraments are now, from hence I certainly conclude, it is &s;afer to wait GOD's Time for them, than to receive them from uncommi&s;&s;ionated Hands. And where GOD gives not an Opportunity to receive them according to his ap|pointed Order, he will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with us for not receiving them.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider how heinous a Crime it is to coun|terfit a Man's Hand, and much more the Hand and Seal of a Prince, I am afraid to pretend that I have a
<PB N="59" REF="006637_0058_1029723A6BE4D4E8">Commi&s;&s;ion to &s;end Amba&s;&s;adors to act, &s;ign, and &s;eal in CHRIST'S Name, when I know I have none; or even to join with tho&s;e who do &s;o. Here is one Difficulty, which if Mr. <HI>Hobart,</HI> had helped me to overcome, <HI>I &s;hould</HI> have returned him many Thanks; and have been en|couraged to have propo&s;ed &s;ome more. But &s;ince he either will not, or can not help me to get rid of the Apprehen&s;ion of this amazing Guilt which &s;tares me full in the Face, when ever I think of joining with the Di&s;&s;enters, I hope he will not be &s;o unkind to my Soul, as to continue to urge me to that Cour&s;e which will expo&s;e me to the Danger of eternal Damnation. For though I may be mi&s;taken, and the Thing in it|&s;elf be harmle&s;s enough, yet &s;o long as I believe it to be a Crime of a very heinous Nature, the doing it mu&s;t expo&s;e me to the La&s;hes of a guilty Con&s;cience, and the Anger of GOD. For <HI>he that doubteth is damned, and what&s;oever is not of Faith is Sin.</HI> Whatever a Man believes to be a Sin, though in it&s;elf innocent, yet in him it is a wilful Sin if he doth it. I know without his Teaching, that there are &s;ome Things in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that might be altered for the better, and I hope will be &s;o, but &s;eeing as it now is, it is the be&s;t I can join with. I therefore hope to live and die in it, and leave it to the Reader whether this is not the &s;afe&s;t Cour&s;e I can take? But if after all the <HI>&s;eri|ous</HI> Reader &s;hould think thus, there is a great deal of Piety among the <HI>New-England</HI> Mini&s;ters, and therefore though their Call or Ordination is not regular, yet it may be &s;afe to continue with them. I would ask one Que&s;tion, &s;uppo&s;e, that the good People who fir&s;t &s;et|tled this Country, in&s;tead of erecting a new Mini&s;try, had only changed the Elements of the LORD'S Supper; and in&s;tead of Bread and Wine, had u&s;ed Fle&s;h and <HI>Cyder,</HI> if that had been the Ca&s;e, might there not have been as much Piety among them as there is now? And yet would it not have been our Duty to have joined with a more regular Church? And if the altering of CHRIST'S Supper would have made Separation a Duty, why not the altering his Mini&s;try?</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="006637_0059_1029723D66F37F20">
I have now fini&s;h't the mo&s;t valuable Part of the Controver&s;y; what remains is little el&s;e, but a Collection of Calumnies, &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable, I &s;hall briefly examine. Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> a&s;&s;erts, that there is no Di&s;cipline in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> unle&s;s a Shadow is a Sub&s;tance, and in this Country we have le&s;s than none, if le&s;s can be; this I called <HI>unruly Talking.</HI> Upon which he makes a Remark in the&s;e Words, P. 104. Mr. <HI>Beach repre&s;ents tho&s;e who complain of Defects in the Di&s;cipline of the Church as her Adver&s;aries, and would have you conceive of them as a Pack</HI> of unruly Talkers. And yet at the &s;ame Time, I never pretended that there were no <HI>Defects</HI> in the Di&s;cipline of the Church, nor ever knew any Churchman that did pretend it. All that I did, was to give you Bi&s;hop <HI>Beveridge</HI>'s Account of it, that you might judge whether it were &s;o vile as &s;ome Men pretend. I did not look upon my&s;elf at all concerned to ju&s;tify or condemn the <HI>&s;piritual Courts,</HI> as we in this Country &s;hall never be concerned with them, unle&s;s we chu&s;e them. And yet to vindicate the Government at Home, and to wipe off a horrid Ca|lumny from the Laws of our Mother Country, I will venture to &s;ay again, it is <HI>unruly Talking</HI> to &s;ay, that by the <HI>Law</HI> a Clergyman is bound to admit to the Lord's Supper, Drunkards, Whoremongerers, Adulte|rers, Dei&s;ts and Athei&s;ts, provided they have or may have a Commi&s;&s;ion; and if the Mini&s;ter refu&s;es, he mu&s;t be fined <HI>five hundred Pounds Sterling. So that in this Ca&s;e there is no Medium between Starving and Damming. This I call unruly Talking,</HI> and I hope I can make it ap|pear &s;uch to every candid Reader.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Te&s;t Act</HI> here complain'd of, is the Law of the Nation, not the Church, and it requires that they who have Commi&s;&s;ions &s;hould be Communicants in the Church. Now let it be Mr. <HI>Hildrop,</HI> or who it will, who &s;ays this Law leaves a <HI>Clergy-man</HI> no <HI>Medium be|tween Starving or Damning,</HI> he arraigns the Laws of the Nation, and charges the whole Legi&s;lature with the horrid Sin of Per&s;ecution in the highe&s;t Degree. For
<PB N="61" REF="006637_0060_1029723EED3DDD08">neither <HI>Heathen,</HI> nor <HI>Papal Rome</HI> in the hotte&s;t Per&s;ecu|tion, ever did wor&s;e than to leave Chri&s;tians no Medium between Dying or Damning.</P>
<P N="2">2. If any <HI>Clergy-man</HI> &s;hould ever &s;uffer any Penalty, much more that of <HI>five hundred Pounds Sterling,</HI> for re|fu&s;ing to give the Sacrament to a notorious &s;candalous Per&s;on, how great a Man &s;oever he might be, this <HI>Clergy-man</HI>'s Suffering, cannot be owing to the Law, but to the Inju&s;tice of the Judge or Jury. For &s;uch a Mini&s;ter, &s;o repelling has the Law clearly on his Side. For the <HI>Rubrick</HI> is the Law, which runs thus, <HI>So many as intend to be Partakers of the holy Communion, &s;hall &s;ig|nify their Names to the Curate, at lea&s;t &s;ome Time the Day before. And if any of tho&s;e be an open and notorious evil Liver, or have done any wrong to his Neighbours by Word or Deed, &s;o that the Congregation be thereby offended; the Curate having Knowledge thereof, &s;hall call him, and adverti&s;e him, that in any wi&s;e he pre&s;ume not to come to the</HI> LORD<HI>'S Table, until he hath openly declared him&s;elf to have truly repented and amended his former naughty Life;</HI> and he is not to <HI>&s;uffer them to be Partakers of the</HI> LORD<HI>'S Table,</HI> till this is done. Now this I &s;ay is the <HI>Law,</HI> and by it every Mini&s;ter is obliged to <HI>repell</HI> all notori|ous evil Livers, and no to &s;uffer them to come to the LORD'S Table. And there is no Law that difan|nuls it. And though it may happen once in an Age, that a Mini&s;ter may be undone by doing his Duty ac|cording to Law; yet it is fal&s;e, to &s;ay that the <HI>Law</HI> undoes him, it is the Wickedne&s;s of the Judge, or Jury, or the Malice of &s;ome great Man that &s;tarves and undoes him. And may not a Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter happen to be undone &s;o too?</P>
<P>As to our Di&s;cipline in this Country, which he &s;ays is none at all, I ob&s;erved, our Clergy may be &s;u&s;pended by the Commi&s;&s;ary, &s;ilenced by the Bi&s;hop, and finally impri&s;oned if need be. To this he makes no Reply.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>Laity,</HI> we keep from the Communion all that we judge unworthy. But he &s;ays we have no
<PB N="62" REF="006637_0061_1029724096962E48">Right to do this, but &s;hould be puni&s;hed for our Pre|&s;umption, if we were not too far from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But I would ob&s;erve, that as the <HI>Rubrick</HI> is the Law of the Church, and the De&s;ign of it is, that no &s;can|dalous Per&s;on &s;hould be &s;uffered to partake of the LORD'S Supper, &s;o when the Cau&s;e can't be laid before the <HI>Or|dinary,</HI> not only not within fourteen Days, but al&s;o not within fourteen Years, yet &s;till it gives us Right, and obliges us to keep the Offender from the LORD'S Sup|per till he repent.</P>
<P>And to &s;ay that we mu&s;t repell none from the Sacra|ment, becau&s;e we can't give an Account of it to the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> within fourteen Days, is to defeat the End of the Law, and contradict the De&s;ign of it, it is &s;uch a perver&s;e Interpretation, as would be admitted by no equal Judges.</P>
<P>And our Superiors at Home, are &s;o far from re&s;enting our Conduct in this Affair, as he pretends, that they would be highly and ju&s;tly di&s;plea&s;ed with us, if we did not keep all notorious Offenders from the Communion.</P>
<P>He taxes me with Fal&s;hood and Profanene&s;s, in &s;peaking &s;o &s;lightily of their Di&s;cipline in the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> of <HI>Branford,</HI> and &s;ome good People of <HI>Guilford,</HI> whom they laid under Cen&s;ure; and as I was informed, excommunicated.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> was re&s;tored; which I never denied. What I &s;aid was this, that in <HI>Defiance</HI> of their Cen&s;ure and &s;ilencing, he continued his Admini&s;trations as much as ever; and &s;o in all likelihood would have done to this Day, if they had never took off the Cen|&s;ure. Their Cen&s;ure &s;ignified nothing.</P>
<P>As to the good People at <HI>Guilford,</HI> their Ca&s;e (if I mi&s;take not) was this, upon chu&s;ing a Mini&s;ter, a con|&s;iderable Part of the Congregation, declared their Di&s;|&s;atisfaction in the Per&s;on cho&s;en, and &s;o refu&s;ed to own him as their Mini&s;ter. After &s;ome Time they were laid under Cen&s;ure. But notwith&s;tanding this Cen&s;ure, which I &s;uppo&s;e remains upon them to this Day, they became and continue as regular a Church as any in the
<PB N="63" REF="006637_0062_1029724396119110">Goverment. In mentioning this Ca&s;e, I called them <HI>zealous Souls,</HI> which I did from a per&s;onal Acquaintance I had had with &s;ome of them, who appeared to me to be very hone&s;t, and as zealous as any Set of Men at all, and told me with Tears in their Eyes, that they would not have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to &s;o much Trou|ble and Difficulty, had it not been for Con&s;cience &s;ake. And I mu&s;t confe&s;s that it appeared to me amazing, (though I was then a Di&s;&s;enter) that &s;o many &s;erious, grave and religious People, for a &s;mall and common Error, &s;hould be all without Mercy given up to <HI>Satan.</HI> This Expre&s;&s;ion it &s;eems has rai&s;ed his Anger to a very high Pitch. He calls it <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;quing</HI> the holy Scripture, and Infidel like, and I know not what. But I hope the bare &s;tating the Ca&s;e will ju&s;tify me. To &s;hew what mi&s;chievous Wretches the Mini&s;ters of the Church of <HI>England</HI> are in this Country, he frequently repeats that Calumny that we receive to our Communion, &s;uch &s;can|dalous Per&s;ons as they have laid under Cen&s;ure, and would have it believed that this is our common Prac|tice. P. 112. Now if he had known any one In&s;tance of this Nature, I'm per&s;uaded that he who deals &s;o much in Scandal would have publi&s;hed it. For my Part I know of no &s;uch Thing. And notwith&s;tanding his &s;waggering &s;o much of their Di&s;cipline that in the &s;eve|ral Towns where I am concerned, and among many hundreds of People, I know of but one Per&s;on under their Cen&s;ure, and given to <HI>Satan.</HI> And this Man has ever had a good Character, and for many Years has been a Me&s;&s;enger of one of their Churches, and a Mem|ber of their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils, but he happened to fall into that abominable Sin of &s;aying that his Mini&s;ter preached <HI>fal&s;e Doctrine.</HI> Now the fal&s;e Doctrine was no wor&s;e than this, that the <HI>Sins of a Child of GOD, were better Evidences of his good E&s;tate than external Duties,</HI> &amp;c. And his di&s;liking and condemning &s;uch Doctrine in his Mini&s;ter, was all the Scandal that I could ever hear that he was charged with, and I have &s;een the Charge drawn up again&s;t him; and yet to
<PB N="64" REF="006637_0063_1029724975BF79C8"><HI>Satan</HI> he was given. Now if this Man had de&s;ired Admi&s;&s;ion to our Communion, as he never did; yet to prevent Obloquy I &s;hould not have received him, until I had con&s;ulted with my Superiors, and taken their Directions. Whoever reads Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> and finds the Practice of receiving tho&s;e whom they Cen&s;ure &s;o often, and &s;o awfully charged upon us, mu&s;t needs con|clude, that they drive on a mighty Trade of cen&s;uring and excommunicating their People for Immoralities, and we as con&s;tantly receive to our Communion tho&s;e whom they re&s;igned to <HI>Satan.</HI> And yet every Body in the&s;e Parts knows that there is not one Word of Truth in it. What can be more unju&s;t than &s;uch Slan|ders, unle&s;s it be what follows? P. 112. He &s;ays thus, <HI>That the Practice of Religion declines, and that Irreligion and Profanene&s;s grow upon us in all Places where the Church prevails, you all know in your own Con&s;ciences that it is true; and Mr.</HI> Beach <HI>him&s;elf has not the Hardine&s;s to deny it.</HI> If I have not <HI>Hardine&s;s,</HI> I'm &s;ure he has a very large Stock of it. I have known &s;ome Men who in a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, have <HI>Hardine&s;s</HI> enough to &s;ay any Thing that is Spightful and Ill-natured, although there is no Truth in it. To be &s;ure, what he &s;ays I had not the <HI>Hardine&s;s</HI> to deny, I really did deny at the &s;ame Time. The Generality of <HI>wa&s;pi&s;h</HI> People after a &s;hort Fit of Anger, grow calm; but the longer Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> writes, the more fierce and out-ragious he grows. He &s;ays, P. 112. <HI>All</HI> my <HI>Argument &s;eems as if it were de&s;igned to prove that the wor&s;t Religion commonly does produce the be&s;t Men.</HI> To which I reply, when a Man is tran&s;|ported with Pa&s;&s;ion, Arguments and Things <HI>&s;eem</HI> quite different from what they really are. And if Mr.<HI>Hobart</HI> will put off <HI>Wrath</HI> and grow cool, my Argument will appear in a very different Light. And certainly he does not well to be &s;o very angry, becau&s;e he found him&s;elf unable to an&s;wer it. My Argument as he calls it, is this, we cannot know whether the peculiar Tenets of any Sect of Chri&s;tians are true or fal&s;e, merely by the good or bad Lives of the Profe&s;&s;ors of that Sect, E. G.
<PB N="65" REF="006637_0064_1029724C72165788">You cannot certainly determine, whether the peculiar Tenets of the <HI>Bapti&s;ts, Congregationali&s;ts, Presbyterians</HI> or <HI>Church Men</HI> are true, by ob&s;erving their Lives, be|cau&s;e they all agree in holding the omnipotent Mo|tives to a holy Life, contained in the Go&s;pel. And be|cau&s;e &s;ome Men who have unhappily fallen into &s;uch Here&s;ies as <HI>Arriani&s;m</HI> and <HI>Sociniani&s;m</HI> have lived ex|cellent Lives, it is therefore very dangerous to make this our Rule to judge by. Now I don't find, that Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> is able to confute this, but in&s;tead of that, falls to his wonted Practice of Railing, and &s;ays, I <HI>&s;eem</HI> to de&s;ign to prove that the wor&s;t Religion commonly makes the be&s;t Men. Whereas I was not &s;peaking of different <HI>Religions,</HI> but only of different Opinions in the &s;ame excellent Religion. And though it may again provoke his Anger, I will venture to add, although he Boa&s;ts much of their Di&s;cipline, as though it were the main Pillar of Religion, yet the <HI>Quaker</HI> Di&s;cipline does va&s;tly excell the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> in Strictne&s;s; and they cen&s;ure ten at lea&s;t, to the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> one; and yet I &s;uppo&s;e he won't think that a good Rea&s;on to turn <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;aying the&s;e Things, I do not take it for granted, as he &s;ays, that <HI>the Practice of Religion decays,</HI> as the Church grows.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded, that &s;olid Chri&s;tian Virtue, as well as Knowledge increa&s;es as the Church gains Ground in the Country; and Thou&s;ands of People are really bet|tered by it in their moral Character. If he knows none that are &s;o, I think I do. I &s;hould be a&s;hamed of this kind of Di&s;puting, if he had not compelled me to it. In a Word, there is nothing in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that can hinder us from being as eminent in true Piety, as we can po&s;&s;ibly be in any Church on Earth. And therefore whether it be true, or fal&s;e, that there are many loo&s;e People who pretend to be Churchmen, yet it is nothing to the Purpo&s;e: For other Men's neglect|ing or abu&s;ing the be&s;t Means of Piety, need be no Hindrance to my making a good Improvement of them.</P>

I come now to examine what he has &s;aid of the Con|duct of the <HI>Venerable Society.</HI> Which he begins with an Introduction in the&s;e Words, P. 113. <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e no|thing in my former Addre&s;s is more re&s;ented by my Antago|ni&s;ts, than what I &s;aid on this Head; and they have their Rea&s;ons for it; for it mu&s;t be owned, that Intere&s;t is a very tender Point with mo&s;t Men. &mdash; Their Intere&s;t and a very con&s;iderable one, evidently lay at Stake.</HI> &mdash; Now what &s;uch ill-natured and unmanly Flouts can prove, I do not un|der&s;tand; unle&s;s it be the Author's Uncharitablene&s;s and Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, he mu&s;t needs judge our Hearts by his own, otherwi&s;e he could not conclude that Intere&s;t is dearer to us than the Truth of CHRIST. Be&s;ides, this malicious A&s;per&s;ion is perfectly groundle&s;s; for Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> whom he in particular charges with it, has no Intere&s;t at all at Stake, nor any Concern with the So|ciety, and Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> and I could at any Time advance our Intere&s;t by leaving <HI>New-England;</HI> &s;o that if we were ever &s;o wicked Men, this Reproach is certainly groundle&s;s. And to &s;lander the <HI>Devil,</HI> is unmanly. Jude 9. <HI>Michael</HI> the <HI>Archangel when contending with the Devil, dur&s;t not bring again&s;t him a railing Accu&s;ation, but the&s;e &s;peak evil of tho&s;e Things which they know not.</HI> However, in Gratitude towards that venerable and cha|ritable Corporation, I &s;hall &s;ay a few obvious Things in an&s;wer to his virulent A&s;per&s;ions. What he chiefly in&s;i&s;ts upon is, that the Society ought not to &s;end Mi&s;|&s;ionaries to &s;uch Places where there are <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Mi|ni&s;ters of any Denomination, at lea&s;t no till the Hea|then are all converted, and all &s;uch Places as have no &s;ort of Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters are &s;upplied. This is the grand Point which he contends for, and pretends he does it out of a Principle of Charity to the Souls which are peri&s;hing in Darkne&s;s. I think this is the Sum of his Di&s;cour&s;e in both Addre&s;&s;es. This I confe&s;s has a plau&s;ible Appearance; but I think a very pernicious Tendency. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. There are now &s;o many Colleges and <HI>Shepherd's Tents,</HI> and &s;o many Teachers of various Opinions, all
<PB N="67" REF="006637_0066_10297252D2247090">called <HI>Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters,</HI> that there is &s;carce a Place on the Continent &s;ettled by his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, where there is not a Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter of one Kind or another &s;ettled among&s;t them. So that if the So|ciety mu&s;t not &s;end Mi&s;&s;ionaries where there are <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> Mini&s;ters, they mu&s;t very &s;oon &s;end none to this Continent; For wherever the Society erects a Mi&s;&s;ion, there the Di&s;&s;enters &s;oon open a Meeting.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, there is no Place, where it is other|wi&s;e; but this is true of all Places that I know; and if it be otherwi&s;e in a few Places <HI>now,</HI> I am per&s;uaded it will not be &s;o <HI>long.</HI> If therefore Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Rea&s;on|ing takes Place, the Society mu&s;t withdraw all their Mi&s;&s;ions from this Continent, and leave many Thou|&s;ands of Church People to turn Sectaries, any Thing or Nothing: which will certainly be the Con&s;equence. Which whether it can con&s;i&s;t with their Charity I leave.</P>
<P>I readily agree with him, that it is not the De&s;ign of the Charter that the Society &s;hould &s;end Mi&s;&s;ionaries to convert <HI>Presbyterians</HI> to the Church: and I am far|ther of Opinion, that it is a ba&s;e <HI>Reflection</HI> in him to &s;ay they do &s;o. For they never &s;end a Mi&s;&s;ionary where there is a Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter of any Denomina|tion, unle&s;s there be likewi&s;e a Number of Church People who earne&s;tly de&s;ire a Mini&s;ter, and yet can't afford a &s;ufficient Maintenance. They never &s;end Mi&s;|&s;ionaries to convert Prote&s;tants to the Church of <HI>En|gland;</HI> but to mini&s;ter to Church People; and if Di&s;|&s;enters by that Means are added to the Church, they are not a&s;hamed to own, they do not think by this any Evil is done. This is the <HI>Truth and all the Truth.</HI> And therefore it is a <HI>&s;curvie Reflection,</HI> when he &s;ays that the Society and their Mi&s;&s;ionaries do ju&s;t as the Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>David</HI>'s &s;ays, the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Society <HI>de Propaganda Fide do; only changing</HI> the Word <HI>Pope</HI> for <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI> P. 132.</P>
<P>I grant, there was a Time, when, as Dr. <HI>Bray</HI> &s;ays, there was little or no Occa&s;ion of &s;ending Mi&s;&s;ionaries to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> or <HI>Connecticut,</HI> becau&s;e there was then few or no Church People who wanted a Mini&s;ter,
<PB N="68" REF="006637_0067_1029725457D73DB0">yet now the Ca&s;e is very much altered, and as there are &s;ome Thou&s;ands, &s;o they are like to increa&s;e, not|with&s;tanding all Oppo&s;ition. I think he is mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing that the Church would have come to no|thing before this Time, if the Society had not upheld it; for though we acknowledge their Charity with the &s;incere&s;t Gratitude; yet I believe, unle&s;s we had met with as &s;evere a Per&s;ecution, as the Prote&s;tants do in <HI>France,</HI> it would have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted and grown. For the People in this Country are naturally inqui&s;itive, and the Di&s;&s;enting Religion always changing and fluctuating, and the Writings of the Church coming in to the Coun|try and exceeding all others, the mo&s;t ingenious Peo|ple would from Time to Time become in Heart Church|men, though they had not an Opportunity to join with the Church. This was the Ca&s;e of &s;everal before ever the Society opened a Mi&s;&s;ion in <HI>Connecticut.</HI></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to what I had &s;aid of the Society's being ready to improve all Opportunities to convert the Heathen, he &s;ays, P. 142. he will <HI>mention one particular In&s;tance of the Society's neglecting a fair Opportunity of chri&s;tianizing the Heathen,</HI> which is the <HI>Scheme of the late Reverend Mr.</HI> Serjeant <HI>for erecting a Boarding School, for the Education of Indian Children,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now as to this, I will venture to &s;ay, that had Mr. <HI>Serjeant</HI> applied to the Society, and offered to be their Mi&s;&s;ionary to the&s;e very Indians, they would certainly have received him joyfully, and have &s;upported him in that Mi&s;&s;ion Liberally. But as there never was any &s;uch Motion made to them; &s;o I can't &s;ee with what Ju&s;tice they can for this be charged with neglecting the Heathen. Is it a Crime in the Society, that by <HI>Orthodox Clergy,</HI> they don't think is meant all &s;orts of Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters or Teachers, and con&s;equently don't incline to maintain them? Indeed he undertakes to prove that by Orthodox Clergy, in their Charter, is meant all kind of Mini&s;ters except <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts. P. 143. <HI>All Calvini&s;t Mini&s;ters</HI> at lea&s;t. But every one who under&s;tands Engli&s;h, knows that the Words <HI>Clergy</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="006637_0068_10297255DDC1D7F8">and <HI>Orthodox Clergy</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> no more means Di&s;&s;ent|ing Mini&s;ters of the Presbyterian, Independent, or Bap|ti&s;t Per&s;ua&s;ion, than the Word <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> denotes Presby|terian, Independent, or Anabapti&s;t Bi&s;hops; though they all e&s;teem them&s;elves the only true Bi&s;hops, and the only Orthodox Clergy.</P>
<P>He further argues, that King <HI>William</HI> who granted this Charter <HI>was a Calvini&s;t.</HI> But I an&s;wer, he was no Di&s;&s;enter, but being the Head or Protector of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he u&s;ed the Word in the &s;ame Sen&s;e as the Church u&s;es it. And &s;uch a <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> as he was, he gave a Salary to &s;upport a Mini&s;ter in the fir&s;t Church of <HI>England</HI> Congregation in <HI>New-England.</HI> And as to what he &s;ays of Dr. <HI>Mac&s;parran,</HI> he is mi&s;|taken, for the King in Council never did declare Di&s;|&s;enting Mini&s;ters to be Orthodox Clergy in the legal Sen&s;e; it was only in the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> Sen&s;e, or what was &s;uppo&s;ed the Sen&s;e of the Donors of the Land in Di&s;|pute. And when the Story is rightly told, it will ap|pear, they had but little Occa&s;ion for giving publick Thanks to Almighty GOD upon that Account as &s;ome of them did. He adds, that the Society under&s;tood it &s;o. But I add they never did &s;o under&s;tand it, and accordingly never did &s;end a Di&s;&s;enter upon the Mi&s;&s;ion. Neither does the Words <HI>Calvini&s;t Mini&s;ter,</HI> denote a Di&s;&s;enting Teacher as Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> imagines.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;eems &s;o full of Compa&s;&s;ion towards the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> that he would have us all quit <HI>New En|gland,</HI> and go among&s;t them, although we have no manner of Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, but were &s;ure to be knocked on the Head, or &s;hot to Death for our Pains. For &s;ays he, <HI>'Tis a poor Shift indeed to pretend that the Indians Aver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity excu&s;es the Society from making any Attempts to convert them to it. Had the A|po&s;tles and primitive Chri&s;tians been of Mr.</HI> Beach<HI>'s Mind in this Ca&s;e, Chri&s;tianity had probably never made any Pro|gre&s;s in the World.</HI> P. 139.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, the Ca&s;e of the Apo&s;tles differed widely
<PB N="70" REF="006637_0069_10297258D96A9780">from ours, they had Miracles to awaken the Attention of the mo&s;t &s;tupid or ob&s;tinate, and therefore might expect Succe&s;s where there was no previous Inclinati|on to hear or receive them. They might with good Rea&s;on have gone into &s;uch a Country as <HI>Spain</HI> now is, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Inqui&s;ition;</HI> and have Preached free|ly again&s;t Super&s;tition and Idolatry; but I don't &s;ee that any &s;ober Mini&s;ter how zealous &s;oever, no, nor &s;o great an Enthu&s;ia&s;t as Mr. <HI>Whitefild</HI> does think that he has at this Day a Call to do &s;o: or &s;hould be likely to do any Good in &s;uch a mad Undertaking.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> goes on in his u&s;ual Way of Fleering, and &s;ays, <HI>I hope Mr.</HI> Beach <HI>does not mean, that &s;o long as the Indians have an Aver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity, the Society are ex|cu&s;able in letting them alone; but if once they &s;hould em|brace it in the Form of Presbyteriani&s;m or Independency, it would be Time to &s;end Mi&s;&s;ionaries to convert them to the Epi&s;copacy and Liturgy of the Church of England.</HI> P. 139.</P>
<P>No, no, Mr. <HI>Hobart,</HI> I don't mean any Thing like that, and you know I don't. All I de&s;ire of you is, that when we endeavour to in&s;truct them in the Chri&s;tian Religion, you would not try to prejudice them again&s;t us, as &s;ome have done. When I fir&s;t came into this Mi&s;&s;ion, I made an Attempt to in&s;truct the <HI>Indians</HI> near to <HI>Newtown,</HI> being about 20 Families: but after a &s;hort Trial I found that I labour'd in vain, and they refu&s;ed to hear any Thing about Religion from me, and to &s;hew how much they defied the Thoughts of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> they would call me <HI>Churchman, Churchman,</HI> out of Contempt, which they had learned from the neighbouring Di&s;&s;enters. And &s;ome of the&s;e poor Creatures with whom I had culti+vated &s;ome Intimacy, advi&s;ed me to give over my At|tempt; for the Engli&s;h they &s;aid, had told them, that if they received me for their Mini&s;ter, they mu&s;t main|tain me, and I would in Time get their Land from them. Pretty much as Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;trives to prejudice the good People of <HI>New-England</HI> again&s;t the Church, by telling them of an intolerable Yoke that it will
<PB N="71" REF="006637_0070_1029725ECA19F3E8">bring them under, if they come into it; that they mu&s;t pay Tithes and maintain the dignify'd Clergy in <HI>En|gland,</HI> &amp;c. As I e&s;teem it a greater Good to convert one Infidel to Chri&s;tianity, than an hundred Di&s;&s;enters to the Church; &s;o it would have been a va&s;t Plea&s;ure to me, if I might but have &s;ucceeded in this De&s;ign. And though he reproaches the Society for neglecting the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Stockbridge;</HI> yet I am per&s;uaded if they &s;hould open a Mi&s;&s;ion there, (as I am confident they would if de&s;ired,) and &s;end one of us to in&s;truct tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> would di&s;like it as much as he does our continuing among the Engli&s;h. And if &s;o, it will &s;eem that his Charity to the <HI>Indians</HI> Souls, is like <HI>Judas</HI> his Charity to the <HI>Poor,</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>why was this</HI> Wa&s;te? It might have been &s;old for much, and have been given to the Poor, not <HI>that he cared for the Poor.</HI> &mdash; Envy &s;ome|times wears the Mask of Charity.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> repre&s;ents it, as though wherever the Church comes, it de&s;troys the Practice of Religion, and brings an Inundation of Wickedne&s;s &mdash; and yet that if we would go and &s;et up this &s;ame wicked Church, almo&s;t any where out of <HI>New-England,</HI> he &s;ays, it would be an inlarging the Redeemer's Kingdom, and a bring|ing many Souls to Glory; which is &s;uch a mon&s;trous Incon&s;i&s;tency, that one would be tempted to think, that if we might but be bani&s;hed, or &s;tarved out of <HI>New-En|gland,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> does not much care who&s;e Kingdom we inlarge.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing he is &s;o extreamly urgent for us all to leave <HI>New England,</HI> and go &s;ome where among the <HI>In|dians,</HI> and yet does not pretend that he can tell us where we may go, to be received by them and live among them; it looks therefore as though he had &s;o much Love and good Will to our Souls, as to wi&s;h us all the great Happine&s;s of going to Heaven by the Way of Martyrdom.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Head when I have made one or two Remarks.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It is impo&s;&s;ible with any Degree of Mode&s;ty to arraign either the Wi&s;dom or Faithfulne&s;s of the
<PB N="72" REF="006637_0071_102972604EACD218">Society, upon the Account of their not &s;ending Mi&s;&s;i|onaries to this or that Place; unle&s;s we knew their Affairs and in what Degree the People who &s;eem to be neglected, were <HI>worthy</HI> of a Mi&s;&s;ionary, as well as the Society do; which certainly Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> does not.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Every Benefactor to the Society is allowed the Privilege to appropriate his Benefaction to the in&s;truct|ing the <HI>Heathen,</HI> if he plea&s;es; &s;o that it &s;hall be put to no other U&s;e. Accordingly &s;ome do confine their Be|nefactions to the in&s;tructing the <HI>Negroes,</HI> &s;ome to the purcha&s;ing Bibles to be &s;ent to one particular Mi&s;&s;i|onary, &amp;c. and every ones De&s;ire is punctually com|plied with. And therefore Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s repre&s;enting the Society as being fal&s;e to their Tru&s;t and defeating the De&s;ign of the Donors, is very unju&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. As the Benefactors certainly know, where the Mi&s;&s;ionaries are &s;ent, &s;o it mu&s;t be pre&s;umed, that it is their De&s;ire that their Donations &s;hould be put to that U&s;e, to which they are now applied. Nay, that they would withdraw their Sub&s;criptions and Benefactions if they were not &s;o u&s;ed.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> tells us, that in <HI>Queen Anne's Reign, when High-Church was rampant, and the Prote&s;tant Religion lay ga&s;ping at her Feet</HI> &mdash; it was at this <HI>unhappy Sea&s;on, that the Society diverted from their original De&s;ign,</HI> and ingaged in the <HI>Party Bu&s;ine&s;s of promoting</HI> the Church of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Presbyterians.</HI></P>
<P>And yet in the &s;ame Page, before he has got to the Bottom, he forgets him&s;elf, and &s;ays, it was when Mr. <HI>Cutler,</HI> Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> went for Orders. This &s;ays he, <HI>turned the Attention of the Society from tho&s;e Places in which they were before propagating the Go&s;|pel, and put an End to their Schemes of inlarging the Redeem|er's Kingdom by bringing the Heathen into it.</HI></P>
<P>Now as both the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions cannot be true, &s;eeing they make an ab&s;olute Contradiction, &s;o there is not one Word of Truth in either of them. For the Soci|ety &s;ince that Time have been &s;o far from laying a|&s;ide their <HI>Scheme of enlarging the Redeemer's Kingdom by
<PB N="73" REF="006637_0072_1029726349DB9EE0">bringing the Heathen into it,</HI> that they have done ten Times as much both in converting Negroes and In|dians &s;ince, than ever they did before. And at that Time which he &s;ays, was <HI>e&s;pecially fatal to Chri&s;tianity,</HI> the Society erected but one &s;ingle Mi&s;&s;ion in <HI>New-En|gland</HI> in which Dr. <HI>Cutler</HI> now &s;erves. An a&s;toni&s;hing Thing indeed, that the a&s;&s;i&s;ting of that one poor Con|gregation in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> &s;hould prove the FATAL Over|throw of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> and put an End to any further inlarging of the Redeemer's Kingdom! It is true, &s;ince the fir&s;t Mi&s;&s;ion was opened in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> which was not at either of the Sea&s;ons mentioned by Mr. <HI>Hobart,</HI> the Church has been growing here, and all Oppo&s;ition and Di&s;couragements &s;eem &s;till to increa&s;e it. Which methinks &s;hould make its Adver&s;aries &s;u&s;pect, that it may be that <HI>Plant</HI> which our heavenly <HI>Father hath planted,</HI> and therefore cannot be <HI>rooted up.</HI> And certainly it would be no Di&s;paragement even to the Wi&s;dom of Mr. <HI>Hobart,</HI> to reflect upon the Advice of <HI>Gamaliel, Acts</HI> v. 38. <HI>Now I &s;ay unto you, refrain from the&s;e Men, and let them alone, for if this Coun&s;el, or this Work be of Men, it will come to nought. But if it be of GOD, ye cannot overthrow it; le&s;t haply ye be found even to fight again&s;t GOD.</HI></P>
<P>If in&s;tead of publi&s;hing &s;o many defamatory Untruths again&s;t the Church People in general, again&s;t the Soci|ety, nay, and repre&s;enting that excellent Prince&s;s Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> as a mo&s;t mortal Enemy to the Prote&s;tant Reli|gion, for which he has no Grounds, but only becau&s;e &s;he was not able for &s;ome Time before &s;he died, to at|tend to the publick Bu&s;ine&s;s; I &s;ay, if in&s;tead of pub|li&s;hing &s;uch virulent Untruths, he had fairly rea&s;oned again&s;t our <HI>Tenets,</HI> he would certainly have con&s;ulted his own Innocence better, although he had not gained &s;o much Applau&s;e among the <HI>Bigots and High fliers</HI> of his Party. As for that Calumny which Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has pub|li&s;hed of Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> and his Son, viz. that they were guilty of the Sin of Sacrilege in taking the Society's Pay, <HI>a Year</HI> or <HI>two</HI> for no Services done; this is an ab|&s;olute
<PB N="74" REF="006637_0073_10297264D1EC8FE0">Forgery of his own: as is made very evident by the Dr. in his Vindication of him&s;elf and his Son in his Letter to the Publi&s;her of the <HI>Po&s;t-Boy</HI> of <HI>June</HI> 24, 1751,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o a Letter of the Doctor's, dated <HI>Aug. 2,</HI> which was &s;ent to the Publi&s;her of the Po&s;t-Boy, but not printed, and is now added as an Appendix to this.</NOTE> in which he &s;ays, <Q>My Son was 2 or 3 Years in doubt which of the two Profe&s;&s;ions to follow: during which Time he was appointed Catechi&s;t, and con&s;tantly officiated at <HI>Ripton,</HI> or <HI>Stratford</HI> in my Ab&s;ence, ac|cording to Agreement, til he finally concluded to follow the Law. &mdash; Upon which he immediately on <HI>March</HI> 25, 1748, wrote his Re&s;ignation to the Soci|ety; and I have by me from the Secretary an An|&s;wer dated <HI>June</HI> 23, following, wherein are the&s;e Words," <HI>"I will acquaint the Society at the next Board with Mr.</HI> John&s;on<HI>'s Re&s;ignation of the Catechi&s;t's Place, and heartily wi&s;h him Succe&s;s in whatever Profe&s;&s;ion he de&s;igns.</HI></Q> &mdash; In the &s;ame Letter he al&s;o vindicates the School there from Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Calumny, and I doubt not but as good an Account if there were Opportunity, might be given of all the re&s;t of his &s;landrous Stories and In&s;inuations. &mdash; As to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Caner,</HI> in parti|cular, I believe any impartial Per&s;on that &s;hall compare his Vindication of him&s;elf with this pretended An&s;wer, will judge, that his, except a little <HI>idle</HI> quibbling, is in effect, only urging the &s;ame Things over again; notwith&s;tanding which, I can't but think his Vindication will be thought yet to &s;tand good; as well as Dr. <HI>John|&s;on</HI>'s Preface, notwith&s;tanding all he has pretended to an&s;wer to that. &mdash; At lea&s;t we are content to leave all that are di&s;po&s;ed to do us Ju&s;tice to compare and judge between us.</P>
<P>As many of Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Calumnies are formed upon an inadvertent or el&s;e a wilful Mi&s;repre&s;entation of the Society's yearly Ab&s;tracts, I will here once for all, &s;tate the Truth of this Matter, that every hone&s;t Man may &s;ee the Inju&s;tice Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> is guilty of, whether he
<PB N="75" REF="006637_0074_1029726AC7BDF2E8">will own it or not. As it is impo&s;&s;ible for the Society to fore&s;ee what Accidents may happen in regard to the Death or Removal of their Mi&s;&s;ionaries; it is their Practice in &s;tating their annual Accounts to charge them&s;elves with every Salary by them at any Time, granted to Mi&s;&s;ionaries, Catechi&s;ts, or School-Ma&s;ters, till &s;uch Times as they have agreed to drop any &s;uch Mi&s;&s;ion or School by them erected. By this Means every one concerned, may &s;ee what is their ordinary annual Expence, which they are liable to pay, though perhaps by Rea&s;on of the Death or Re&s;ignation of &s;ome of their Mi&s;&s;ionaries or Catechi&s;ts, the whole of it may not actually be drawn out of the Trea&s;urers Hands that Year. Thus for In&s;tance, <HI>Marblehead</HI> is now vacant, and has been &s;o for about two Years, and yet the Place is kept upon the Ab&s;tract, and the Society charge them|&s;elves with &pound; 60 <HI>per Ann.</HI> to that Mi&s;&s;ion, though nei|ther is any Thing paid, nor is there any Mi&s;&s;ionary there to demand it. And the Rea&s;on is, that the Society in|tend to re-e&s;tabli&s;h that Mi&s;&s;ion, as &s;oon as a proper Per&s;on appears to di&s;charge the Duties of it.</P>
<P>In like Manner the Society are not &s;olicitous, to drop the Name of any Per&s;on employed by them from the Ab&s;tract, immediately upon his Di&s;charge, provided they intend to replace another in his Stead, but often|times wait till a new Appointment determine who is to &s;ucceed. Thus Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s Son was not only conti|nued upon he Li&s;t, but is &s;till continued, and perhaps may be continued, till &s;ome other Per&s;on is appointed to &s;ucceed him, though he has received nothing from the Society &s;ince the 25th of <HI>March</HI> 1748, but then the Salary allowed for the Place where he formerly offici|ated, is annually carried forward to the &s;ucceeding Years Account, under the Article of Money, remaining in the Hands of the Trea&s;urer. &mdash; The &s;hort is, the So|ciety's De&s;ign is to exhibit to their Benefactors, not &s;o much the preci&s;e Sum actually paid every Year, which &s;ometimes con&s;idering the Death of Mi&s;&s;ionaries at a great Di&s;tance, or other &s;uch Accidents may be very
<PB N="76" REF="006637_0075_1029726DC9A1ED58">difficult if not impo&s;&s;ible; as to give an Ab&s;tract of the annual Charge to which they are liable, and which they have taken upon them&s;elves to make good, if regularly called for. Nor is there any Inju&s;tice done here to the Benefactors, or to any one el&s;e, &s;ince (as I ob&s;erved before) the Surplu&s;age if any &s;uch there be, is brought into the next Year's Account, as Money remaining in the Trea&s;urer's Hands.</P>
<P>From hence now any unprejudiced Per&s;on, may &s;ee what Inju&s;tice Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has been guilty of towards Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> and the Society in charging them in &s;uch a bold unwarrantable Manner, without truly under&s;tand|ing the Affair of which he was writing. I will not ha&s;tily charge him as wilfully mi&s;repre&s;enting the Ca&s;e, but &s;urely he &s;hould have taken better Care to inform him&s;elf rightly, before he pretended to lay &s;o heavy and grievous a Charge. Nor can I think that he will be able to vindicate him&s;elf in this particular, as a can|did Writer or an hone&s;t Man, unle&s;s he publickly re|tracts this abu&s;ive Calumny.</P>
<P>Among other Slanders, he &s;ays, P. 148. <HI>It is credibly reported, that tho&s;e who have &s;igned Petitions for Mi&s;&s;iona|ries, have (to appear like Per&s;ons of &s;ome Con&s;ideration) been &s;ome Times dignified with Civil or Military Titles which they had no Right to.</HI> &mdash; Now as to this,</P>
<P>I remember very well about forty Years ago, I heard this <HI>credible Report</HI> among the Boys at <HI>Stratford,</HI> the Church People had ju&s;t then &s;ent a Petition to the So|ciety for a Mini&s;ter, and a certain Boy, whom I can name reported, as Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;ays, that &s;ome of them in &s;igning this Petition gave them&s;elves the Title of Ju&s;tices of the Peace, others <HI>Captains,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Majors,</HI> and one Man, e&s;teemed the very poore&s;t among them, cal|led him&s;elf <HI>Colonel.</HI> I have not heard this <HI>credible Re|port</HI> &s;ince, till now that it is publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Hobart.</HI> And a great many &s;uch <HI>credible Reports</HI> would have pe|ri&s;hed in eternal Oblivion, had not this great HISTO|RIAN revived, and brought them to Light. But now as to the <HI>Credibility</HI> of this Report, (which like the <HI>Nag's
<PB N="77" REF="006637_0076_1029726F4E4D4140">Head Con&s;ecration,</HI> has now &s;lept about 40 Years.) The fir&s;t Church People in <HI>Stratford,</HI> whatever their moral Character might be among their Enemies, were certainly Men of good Sen&s;e and Knowledge, their <HI>Enemies be|ing Judges.</HI> And is it <HI>credible,</HI> that they would u&s;e &s;uch a fooli&s;h, and more than <HI>childi&s;h</HI> Method to im|po&s;e upon the Society! E&s;pecially when they did no|thing, but by the Direction and with the Mediation of <HI>Colonel Heathcote</HI> and Governor <HI>Hunter.</HI> Is it <HI>credible,</HI> that the&s;e Gentlemen would countenance &s;uch a fooli&s;h, and wicked Project, when they had both been at <HI>Strat|ford,</HI> and conver&s;ed with the&s;e Churchmen all together? as they informed the Society.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Society's Hi&s;tory, <HI>P. 334.</HI></NOTE> Be&s;ides all this, the So|ciety's Hi&s;tory confutes this <HI>credible Report,</HI> it gives us the Character of the Church People at <HI>Stratford</HI> at that very Time, thus, <Q>The fir&s;t People who &s;trove to have the Church Wor&s;hip &s;ettled here, <HI>(Stratford,)</HI> were about 15 Families, mo&s;t Trade&s;men, &s;ome Husband|men, who had been born and bred in <HI>England.</HI> Here you &s;ee are no <HI>civil or military Titles.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Indeed the Society by long Information from all Parts of this Country, have a more perfect and uni|ver&s;al Knowledge of the State of Religion in it, and of the Manners of the People, than either Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> or <HI>I</HI> have. And his Arguments, they had well weighed, above 40 Years ago, as is evident from their Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>But to return to his <HI>credible Report,</HI> every one who has Malice and Impudence enough to invent any di&s;|graceful Story of the Church People, e&s;pecially of their Mini&s;ter, is with &s;uch as Mr. <HI>Hobart,</HI> e&s;teemed a <HI>credi|ble Reporter.</HI> I have had many &s;uch <HI>credible Reports</HI> rai&s;ed of me. It has been as <HI>credibly reported,</HI> that I get &s;o &s;o drunk at the holy Communion that I can't go home, but lie and &s;leep in the Streets. And when his Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Separation</HI> with which he threatens us, comes out, it will no Doubt be filled with many &s;uch <HI>credible Reports.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="006637_0077_1029727247B115F0">
If what Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> &s;ays, is ju&s;t, P. 168. <HI>When a Per&s;on has Tryal of cruel Mockings, and has his Name ca&s;t out as evil, for keeping a good Con&s;cience, and doing his Duty; it is as really Per&s;ecution, as if he &s;uffered Bonds and Impri|&s;onments.</HI> If it be &s;o, the Church People in this Coun|try have had a large and full Cup of Per&s;ecution. But of late, (if my Ob&s;ervation don't fail me) this Bitter|ne&s;s is happily abating, and Charity and mutual good Offices and Friend&s;hip are increa&s;ing among us; I hope Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> with all his <HI>credible Reports,</HI> will not be able to revive and rekindle that bitter unchri&s;tian Spirit of Envy which was almo&s;t extingui&s;hed. Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Artifice is well de&s;cribed by the <HI>Spectator,</HI> No. 125. <Q>There is, &s;ays he, one Piece of Sophi&s;try practi&s;ed by both Sides, and that is the taking any &s;candalous Story that has been ever whi&s;pered or invented of a private Man, for a known undoubted Truth, and rai&s;ing Speculations upon it. Calumnies that have never been proved, or have been often refuted, are the ordinary Po&s;tulatums of the&s;e infamous Scrib|lers, upon which they proceed as upon fir&s;t Princi|ples granted by all Men, though in their Hearts they know they are fal&s;e, or at lea&s;t very doubtful, when they have laid the&s;e Foundations of Scurrility, it is no Wonder that their Super&s;tructure is every way an&s;werable to them. &mdash; It is the re&s;tle&s;s Ambition of artful Men, that thus breaks a People into Factions, and draws &s;everal well-meaning Per&s;ons to their In|tere&s;t by a &s;pecial Concern for <HI>Religion.</HI> How many hone&s;t Minds are filled with uncharitable and barba|rous Notions out of their Zeal for Religion? What Cruelties and Outrages would they not commit, again&s;t Men of an adver&s;e Party, whom they would honour and e&s;teem, if in&s;tead of con&s;idering them as they are repre&s;ented, they knew them as they are? Thus are Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Probity &s;e|duced into &s;hameful Errors and Prejudices and made bad Men, even by that noble&s;t of Principles the Love of <HI>Religion.</HI> I cannot here forbear mentioning
<PB N="79" REF="006637_0078_10297276B747C778">the <HI>famous Spani&s;h</HI> Proverb. <HI>If there were neither Fools nor Knaves in the World, all People would be of one Mind.</HI></Q></P>
<P>How exactly this De&s;ciption agrees to Mr. <HI>Hobart's Piece,</HI> I &s;hall no further determine, than to ob&s;erve, that he has either collected or invented a Number of Facts, &s;ome of which are mere Fiction and Romance, and have no Truth at all in them, others he has very much di&s;gui&s;ed and mi&s;repre&s;ented, and from the&s;e Po&s;tu|latums he has rea&s;oned and drawn Inferences until he has proved us to be the mo&s;t fooli&s;h and wicked Set of Men, the Bane and Pe&s;ts of the Country, the Mur|derers of Souls, nay, and of Religion it&s;elf, &s;o that we ought to be the Scorn and Abhorrence of all Mankind.</P>
<P>Here it may not be improper to examine one In|&s;tance of Railing, which he would have it thought that I am guilty of; which is this, In an&s;wer to his &s;aying, that our Conformity to the Church Wor&s;hip is not to be e&s;teemed an Act of Obedience either to GOD, or the King, I &s;aid, that I feared, that &s;uch as he di&s;obeyed both God and the King, in particular, in that they re|fu&s;ed to pray for the Royal Family, according to the Form injoined by the King. For they think it unlaw|ful to u&s;e a Form of Prayer, impo&s;ed by the highe&s;t Authority on Earth; and &s;o make Con&s;cience of di&s;o|beying GOD and the King.</P>
<P>This put Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> into &s;uch a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, that as he tells us, he quite <HI>trembled, he cries out, is this the Man that began his Book with tho&s;e &s;olemn Expre&s;&s;ions, which con&s;ider'd in this Connection, I tremble to repeat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>is one of the heavie&s;t Charges he ever knew brought again&s;t any Man, it is horrid almo&s;t beyond Concep|tion, for my Part, I cannot conceive any Man on Earth &s;o bad, and I doubt whether human Nature is capable of &s;o great a Degree of Wickedne&s;s.</HI> P. 39. In this Strain he runs on, &s;everal Pages together. Now that the Rea|der may judge whether I de&s;erve &s;uch Treatment for this Expre&s;&s;ion, 1. I would ob&s;erve that it is agreed, that our Governor did &s;end the King's Command to
<PB N="80" REF="006637_0079_102972783AF4AE90">every Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter in this Colony, <HI>in all Prayers for the Royal Family</HI> to u&s;e the&s;e individual Words, <HI>Fre|derick Prince of Wales,</HI> &amp;c. 2. It is notorious Fact that Di&s;&s;enters do make Con&s;cience of refu&s;ing to u&s;e, or to &s;ubmit to a Form of Prayer, enjoyned by the highe&s;t human Authority. I hope I need not prove to a Di&s;|&s;enter, that it is their grand Principle, that though a Thing or Form of Prayer be in it&s;elf ever &s;o indif|ferent or innocent, yet if it once comes to be enjoined or commanded in Religion by human Authority, they are then obliged in Con&s;cience, not to yeild to u&s;e it or &s;ubmit to the <HI>Impo&s;ition.</HI> Now this making Con&s;cience of di&s;obeying the King, when he commands innocent and lawful Things, I verily believe is likewi&s;e a di&s;obey|ing GOD, who has commanded us <HI>to obey the King.</HI> And I would to GOD, I might have no greater Guilt upon my Soul, when I come before my eternal Judge, than I have contracted by this Expre&s;&s;ion. I did not &s;uppo&s;e, that the Di&s;&s;enters thought that they di&s;obeyed GOD in this; For it is a Contradiction, and impo&s;&s;ible to be moved by Con&s;cience to do what I know or be|lieve to be contrary to GOD's Will, for Con&s;cience im|plies a Belief that it is GOD's Will that I &s;hould do &s;o. But my meaning evidently was, that Differenters make Con&s;cience of not doing what they ought to do; un|der the Opinion that GOD has forbidden them to do it, e. g. GOD has commanded them to obey the King, but they think they are bound in Con&s;cience to di&s;o|bey him, if he enjoins any indifferent Thing in Reli|gion. Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> pretends that the King did not &s;end this Command to the Di&s;&s;enters. But I an&s;wer, then our Governor is mi&s;taken, and it mu&s;t be becau&s;e the King knows, that Di&s;&s;enters make Con&s;cience of di&s;o|beying him, or he does not at all value their Prayers. But let that be as it will, what I in&s;i&s;t upon is this, that if the King had laid &s;uch a Command upon them, and they keep to their Principles, they would di&s;obey him out of Con&s;cience, and that I believe is di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="5 letters">ing GOD. And therefore the horrid Repre&s;enta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters"> of
<PB N="81" REF="006637_0080_1029727B35AC6EC8">me, that Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has made, for &s;aying, &s;o, is mo&s;t unrighteous and abu&s;ive. However, I will not &s;ay of his praying for me upon this Occa&s;ion, as he does of my praying that <HI>GOD would forgive him,</HI> viz. that it <HI>is but a Mockery.</HI> No, but I &s;ay <HI>Amen</HI> to it, and thank him for it, and am glad that he found and Inclination in his Heart to pray for me, though I fear it was not without too much <HI>Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>And now as to that Que&s;tion, why Church People here cannot &s;upport their Way of Religion, as well as the Presbyterians theirs? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e we have not the like A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Government. When a Congregation of Presbyterians fir&s;t &s;et up their Wor|&s;hip in any Place, the Government lays a Tax on all the Land in the Pari&s;h for the building their Meeting-Hou&s;e and &s;ettling their Mini&s;ter, from which neither the Church People nor Mini&s;ter is exempted; their Co|lony Rates are likewi&s;e given them, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To which Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> replies, P. 135. <HI>What a peculiar Burden is this? Was ever any poor People &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed before?</HI> And thus he goes on <HI>canting</HI> and <HI>fleering,</HI> and &s;ays he, the <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion which Mr.</HI> Beach <HI>groans under, &s;eems al|mo&s;t to make this wi&s;e Man mad.</HI> This I confe&s;s is un|mercifully <HI>Arch</HI> and <HI>Witty!</HI> And perhaps it may pa&s;s for &s;olid Rea&s;on, and do great Execution, becau&s;e it will rai&s;e a &s;tout <HI>Hor&s;e-Laugh,</HI> which is the Victory of a Banterer. But it does by no Means convince me. He knows I don't complain, that Churchmen pay Colony Rates; but I &s;ay we don't enjoy tho&s;e Favours and Privileges, which our Neighbours do, and this he knows to be true. Nay in &s;ome Re&s;pects Churchmen are de|nied the Privilege of Engli&s;hmen, and treated as Slaves, not being allowed to <HI>vote,</HI> but mu&s;t be taxed by our Ma&s;ters according to their Plea&s;ure. I omit the Affair of the Par&s;onage, it being more proper for the Law. And as to the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s being &s;trictly and legally e&s;tabli&s;hed in this Country, it having always ap|peared to me di&s;putable, I leave it to be di&s;puted by Lawyers, and build upon no Foundation, but what is
<PB N="82" REF="006637_0081_1029727D11090DB0">clear and certain. He pretends, that I fal&s;ify when I intimate, that a Churchman in <HI>Reading</HI> would &s;ave Money by turning Di&s;&s;enter. But as I have a better Opportunity to under&s;tand this Affair than he, &s;o I know that &s;everal Churchmen here would have &s;aved &s;ome hundred Pounds, if they had turned Di&s;&s;enters. I grant indeed, that as the Government is not plea&s;ed to im|power us to rai&s;e Taxes among our&s;elves, but we do all by <HI>Free-Will,</HI> &s;o &s;ome few it is po&s;&s;ible may make an Advantage by it. But who&s;e Fault is this!</P>
<P>He repre&s;ents us as being generally Men of little or no Religion, and few in Number, and poor, and yet complains becau&s;e we have built five Churches in the two Towns of <HI>Stratford</HI> and <HI>Fairfield;</HI> which methinks, don't &s;eem to hang very hand&s;omly together; for the le&s;s Religion People have, the le&s;s Co&s;t and Pains they will be at for the Wor&s;hip of GOD.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;ays to us, P. 159. <HI>If your Separation from us is not certainly right, it is certainly wrong.</HI> In this he is <HI>certainly</HI> mi&s;taken. For we are under no Tie of Con|&s;cience what&s;oever, to wor&s;hip GOD in the Di&s;&s;enting Way? No Law of GOD or Man requires it. If the Church be not e&s;tabli&s;hed here, be&s;ure no other Way is. No Law of this Government forbids the Wor&s;hip of the Church, or if it did, it mu&s;t be null and void from the Beginning, &s;uch a Law being incon&s;i&s;tent with the Charter. And therefore certainly it is no Sin to join in the Church Wor&s;hip. And con&s;equently if the Wor|&s;hip of the Church appears a <HI>more excellent Way,</HI> or if I am doubtful whether the <HI>New-England</HI> Bi&s;hops, be really lawful Bi&s;hops, it is not only harmle&s;s and &s;afe, but my bounden Duty to join with the Church. If any Di&s;&s;enter is <HI>doubtful,</HI> whether it was right to &s;e|parate from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> I mu&s;t &s;ay with Mr. <HI>Hobart, I apprehend an ea&s;y and &s;atisfactory An&s;wer may be given.</HI> Which is, <HI>if you are doubtful whether</HI> it was <HI>right</HI> to &s;eparate from the Church, <HI>that very Doubt is enough to convince you,</HI> that it is wrong for you to keep out of the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="006637_0082_10297282F4F49460">
He &s;ays, P. 160. <HI>Every Man is undeniably under &s;ome Obligation to the Church of which he is a Member.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> in all his three Pieces about Schi&s;m has &s;lily taken a notorious Untruth for his Po&s;tulatum, and built all his Di&s;cour&s;e upon it: viz. that the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> are <HI>One</HI> uniform Church, like the E&s;ta|bli&s;hed Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o that for a Di&s;&s;enter here to become a Churchman, is the &s;ame as a Churchman's turning Di&s;&s;enter in <HI>England,</HI> which is a poor begging the Que&s;tion, and has no Truth in it, as I &s;hall now &s;how. It is certain and notorious, that the Di&s;&s;enting Churches in this Country differ as really, and as much from one another, as many of them do from the Church of <HI>England.</HI> And if you &s;hould &s;ay the Difference is not &s;o great, yet I &s;ay Degrees alter not the kind. In &s;ome Meetings, they u&s;e the Lord's Prayer, read the holy Scriptures, the Mini&s;ter keeps very much to one Form of Prayer, and preaches <HI>Arminiani&s;m,</HI> in other Meetings, there is nothing of all this. In &s;ome Meet|ings the Terms of Communion are very rigid, none are to be admitted, unle&s;s they make a <HI>Relation</HI> of their <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> in others there is nothing like it, and many abhor it. In &s;ome they will gladly admit a Churchman to their Communion; in others they will not, unle&s;s he makes of Recantation and enters into a particular Church Covenant. But a few Years ago the Mini&s;ters of &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Churches dare not ven|ture to baptize out of their own Meeting-Hou&s;es, out of their own Town they had no Power, upon any Occa&s;ion whatever. But to &s;ay no more of the Va|riety, &s;uppo&s;e I am baptized in, and am a Member of any Meeting in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e all will allow, that I may join with any other Presbyterian or Inde|pendent Church in <HI>Connecticut;</HI> although the&s;e two Churches do as really differ from each other, as either of them do from the Church of <HI>England;</HI> why then may I not as lawfully join with the Church of <HI>England?</HI> I hope my being baptized in a Meeting, does not oblige me to be at peace with all, but only with the national Church.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="006637_0083_102972847ABAA718">
Again, if I was baptized in, and became a Member of the Church of <HI>Connecticut</HI> or <HI>Stratford,</HI> why is not the Church of <HI>England</HI> as much a Part of the Church of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> or of <HI>Stratford,</HI> as any other Church is? I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot &s;ee any Thing in this Plea, but a mere Scare-crow to affright weak People. For if this Government had ever &s;o good a Right to e&s;tabli&s;h, yet they really have e&s;tabli&s;hed no Way of Wor&s;hip, but have left every Society to do what is right in their own Eyes. So that every Congregation may pray by Book, or without Book, ju&s;t as the Mini&s;ter and People can agree, and therefore I am no more an Offender again&s;t <HI>Connecticut</HI> Con&s;titution, for u&s;ing the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> than Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> for neglecting it. And &s;eeing mo&s;t of the Churches of this Government have always been altering, improving and reforming till &s;ome of them have got to be almo&s;t, if not altogether Presbyterians, I can not &s;ee, why I might not reform and amend too, as well as my Neighbours, without incurring the <HI>awful Guilt of</HI> Schi&s;m. And pray, whom are we Churchmen <HI>Schi&s;maticks</HI> from? From the Church of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> or the Church of <HI>New-England?</HI> That cannot be; for there is no &s;uch Church; But here are Scores or Hun|dreds of Churches, all differing, both in Doctrine, Di&s;|cipline and Wor&s;hip, not only from one another, but even from them&s;elves in the Compa&s;s of a few Years. And therefore I don't under&s;tand with what Propriety he &s;tiles us a <HI>Separation.</HI> For I'm no more a <HI>Separate</HI> from him than he is from me. My Congregation are no more <HI>Separati&s;ts</HI> from his, than his is from mine. The Presbyterian Congregation in <HI>Reading,</HI> are as much <HI>Separati&s;ts</HI> from us, as we are from them, we are no more obliged by any Law of GOD, or Man, to go to them, than they are obliged to come to us.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> would &s;ay, that the Presby|terian Churches were &s;et up fir&s;t, and therefore we ought to yeild to them. But this is not true; and if it were true, it would make the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Congre|gation in this Place <HI>Schi&s;maticks,</HI> for the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="006637_0084_10297287749C6628">Church was here fir&s;t &s;ettled, before there was any other Church. And as to this Country in general, the Church People, both Mini&s;ters and People came as &s;oon as the Independents; and were &s;ome of the <HI>Patentees.</HI> And the Independents overpowering them, and bani&s;hing them, did not deprive all Churchmen of a Right to breathe in <HI>New-England</HI> Air.</P>
<P>And what if Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;s</HI> and his Company were as Arbitrary as the <HI>Grand Turk,</HI> and as void of all true Religion as the Devils, as he repre&s;ents them, What is that to our Ca&s;e? Does not your own Hi&s;|torian tell you, that &s;ome of the fir&s;t <HI>Patentees</HI> were Churchmen, and &s;et up that Wor&s;hip, and refu&s;ed to part with the Religion of their Mother Country, and for the were bani&s;hed? And yet Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> allows that a Colony <HI>tran&s;planting them&s;elves</HI> carry the Religion of <HI>their Mother Country with them.</HI> If &s;o, I'm &s;ure every Churchman who comes from <HI>England,</HI> had a good Right to keep to the Wor&s;hip. And as Church People had at fir&s;t at lea&s;t as good a Right to &s;et up the Church Wor&s;hip, as the <HI>Browni&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Congregationali&s;ts</HI> had to &s;et up their Way, &s;o we never lo&s;t this Right, though for &s;ome Years unju&s;tly kept out of it while there was no King in I&s;rael, and every Man did what was Right in his own Eyes.</P>
<P>Nay, let us put the Ca&s;e that never any Churchman or Presbyterian had &s;et Foot on <HI>New-England</HI> Shore, but as the Browni&s;ts and Independents fir&s;t &s;et up their Way, &s;o they had continued without Variation to this Day, had this been the Ca&s;e, I ask whether it would be &s;inful or &s;chi&s;matical for &s;ome, or all of the&s;e to turn <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and &s;et up that Way?</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> or any <HI>Presbyterian</HI> mu&s;t allow, this would not only be lawful, but a happy Change, and glorious Reformation, although they had all been <HI>baptized</HI> and <HI>owned their Covenants,</HI> in Independent Churches, nay, although Independents live as good Lives as Presbyterians, and have a &s;tricter Di&s;cipline, and are more rigid in their Terms of Communion.
<PB N="86" REF="006637_0085_1029728A77698818">And if this be granted, as certainly it cannot be de|nied by a <HI>con&s;cientious Presbyterian,</HI> then it unavoidably follows, that if there never had been a Churchman in <HI>New-England</HI> till this Day, yet it would be no Schi&s;m, no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of any Law of GOD for tho&s;e who have been educated in the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Way, and have been Members of their Churches to &s;et up the Wor|&s;hip of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> All the Di&s;pute is, whether it is not a much better or more <HI>excellent</HI> Way? If it be, it is a glorious Reformation for Presbyterians to become Churchmen.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> would account it a commendable Thing for a Member of a New-Light Church, notwith|&s;tanding the Obligations he is under as a <HI>Member,</HI> to &s;eparate from them, and to join with the Old Lights? Why then may not we e&s;teem it a commendable Things, for either old Lights or new, to join with the Church of <HI>England?</HI> For they all originally <HI>&s;chi&s;mati|cally</HI> left the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;ays indeed, that they only left the <HI>Corruptions of the Church.</HI> And ju&s;t &s;o we only leave the Corrup|tions, Errors and Di&s;orders of the Di&s;&s;enters. But &s;o far as they are right, we are ready at all Times to join with them.</P>
<P>In the Conclu&s;ion he puts &s;everal awful Que&s;tions to our Con&s;cience, all grounded upon the fal&s;e Repre&s;en|tation of Facts, he had made before. Which though numerous for the better Show, yet really amount to no more than this, <HI>viz.</HI> if our asking the Society to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, has occa&s;ioned their neglecting the Heather, then we are the <HI>criminal</HI> Cau&s;es of their eternal Dam|nation. And whether we had not better all turn Di&s;|&s;enters? and whether it is not morally certain if we would do &s;o, that the Event would be the Conver&s;ion of a Multitude of Pagans?</P>
<P>To which I reply, we mu&s;t not do a <HI>certain</HI> Evil to obtain an <HI>uncertain</HI> Good. For me to turn Di&s;&s;enter, is to &s;in again&s;t my own Con&s;cience. I can part with my Money, and I hope with my Life: but I can't part with my Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="006637_0086_1029728EE80F10E0">
And as to the Conver&s;ion of the Heathen, I'm &s;o far from being <HI>morally certain,</HI> that my turning Di&s;&s;enter would be the Means of the Conver&s;ion of one Heathen to Chri&s;tianity, that I cannot &s;ee the lea&s;t Probability of it. I am <HI>morally certain</HI> that if the Society knew of any Place be&s;ides tho&s;e they now take care of, where there is a <HI>moral Certainty,</HI> that a Mi&s;&s;ion would be &s;ucce&s;sful, they would mo&s;t gladly embrace &s;uch an Opportunity to convert the Heathen; and rather than the want of Money &s;hould hinder, we would chearfully part with their Favours to us. This <HI>Money</HI> may <HI>peri&s;h with him, who thinks it is more</HI> valuable than the Salva|tion of Souls. And I think we may &s;afely conclude, that we are not the <HI>criminal</HI> Cau&s;es of putting a Stop to the inlarging of the Redeemer's Kingdom; for we are mo&s;t heartily willing for the Promotion of it, not only to part with the Society's Charity; but with our own E&s;tates al&s;o.</P>
<P>But then we don't think it proper, to take Mr. <HI>Ho|bart</HI>'s Advice, and for a mere Dream of I know not what to be done among Pagans, and no Body knows where to leave the Church and loo&s;e the Means of Grace, which through the Society's Goodne&s;s we now enjoy.</P>
<P>How it can be a <HI>criminal</HI> Hindrance to the Inlarge|ment of the Redeemer's Kingdom, for us to ask the Society's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I can't under&s;tand, &s;ince we know that they are va&s;tly more forward to &s;end Mi&s;&s;ionaries to the Heathen, when there is a Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, than to us; as their Wants are more pre&s;&s;ing than ours, and Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s &s;o often a&s;&s;erting the contrary is mere Calumny.</P>
<P>And when we apply to the Society, we only de&s;ire them to judge, whether it be more agreeable to their pious De&s;igns, to grant, or to deny our Reque&s;t. And they are the propere&s;t Judges where their Mi&s;&s;ionaries are like to do the mo&s;t good.</P>
<P>I have now examined every Thing which I e&s;teem material in this Piece, and &s;ome Things perhaps too
<PB N="88" REF="006637_0087_102972906CCA7DE0"><HI>trivial:</HI> And after all remain of Opinion, that he has offered nothing that can ju&s;tify me before GOD or Man, if I &s;hould according to his De&s;ire turn Di&s;&s;enter. If I mi&s;take not, his Piece is mere vehement Declama|tion grounded upon Untruths, Mi&s;repre&s;entations, and Calumnies. However, as every one has a Right to judge for him&s;elf, I don't expect or de&s;ire, that my Judgment &s;hould influence and Body el&s;e.</P>
<P>As I have remarked upon Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Performance, with an <HI>hone&s;t Freedom:</HI> &s;o any one is welcome to find what Fault he plea&s;es with my Opinion, provided he treats me with Truth and Ju&s;tice; which I'm &s;ure Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has not done.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude with an Appeal to my Presby|terian Neighbours, who are competent Witne&s;&s;es, whe|ther &s;everal heinous Crimes laid to my Charge are true. Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has charged us one and all with <HI>the Blood of Souls, yea, with the Blood of Religion it&s;elf,</HI> P. 160. becau&s;e we <HI>&s;o</HI> readily receive tho&s;e whom they for Scandal have laid under Cen&s;ure; this he has repre|&s;ented as our common Practice. Now no Guilt can be more amazing than the Murder of Souls, and the Mur|der of Religion it&s;elf. Damnation is very dreadful, but a double Damnation is due for the Murther of Souls, and of Religion. And yet how often has he repeated this Charge? Now you my <HI>Brethren</HI> and <HI>Neighbours,</HI> are Eye Witne&s;&s;es of our Conduct, you can certainly tell whether the&s;e Things are &s;o: To you I Appeal again&s;t this Accu&s;er, did I ever receive to our Commu|nion one Per&s;on, Man or Woman, whom you had cen|&s;ured or ca&s;t out from your Communion? You all know for certain, that there never was any Thing of this Nature done. Nay, &s;ome of you have complained that I have been too rigid towards tho&s;e who have been &s;o unhappy as to fall into a gro&s;s Sin, in that I do not readmit them to Communion immediately upon their acknowledging their Sin, but wait &s;ome Time for their Amendment.</P>
<P>Again, do I ever, as he charges me, <HI>foment Divi&s;ions</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="006637_0088_1029729365F3CE18">among&s;t you, or di&s;turb your Civil or Eccle&s;iatical Affairs? Is it po&s;&s;ible to meddle le&s;s with other Men's Affairs, or to live more peaceably and inoffen&s;ively than I do?</P>
<P>When he a&s;&s;erts, that &s;uch and &s;uch Things are <HI>cre|dibly reported of us,</HI> e. g. as that we <HI>dignify our&s;elves with Civil and Military Titles, which belong not to us,</HI> when we &s;ign Petitions to the Society, you mu&s;t know that they are &s;o far from being <HI>credible,</HI> that they are incredible and malicious Slanders.</P>
<P>And &s;ince you &s;ee with your Eyes, that the&s;e horrid Charges and Accu&s;ations are groundle&s;s Calumnies and Slanders, (and I believe the &s;ame Appeal may be made by all my Brethren, as I have now made) I de&s;ire it of you, as a Piece of common Ju&s;tice, that you would not countenance or encourage &s;uch Railers, and Propagators of injurious Fal&s;hoods. For it is a Sin to <HI>love</HI> and hug a <HI>Lie,</HI> as well as to <HI>make it.</HI> Whenever I have heard you of the Presbyterian Per&s;ua&s;ion abu&s;ed and mi&s;repre|&s;ented by malicious Per&s;ons, I have e&s;teemed it but ju&s;t, to vindicate you &s;o far as I knew you to be wronged. And it is but ju&s;t that we &s;hould expect the &s;ame Treat|ment from you. <HI>Hone&s;t</HI> Men of all Sides &s;hould com|bine to di&s;countenance the Propagators of Scandal, though of their own Party. For this wicked Practice is not only a great Injury to the Per&s;on defamed, but it alienates and &s;ours the Tempers of People who are obliged to live together, and fills them with Spleen and Rancour to &s;uch a Degree, as their Regard to their private Intere&s;t would never do.</P>
<P>And however you may boa&s;t of your Piety, there is really no more Religion among&s;t you, than there is Love. Love or Charity is but another Name for Holine&s;s. And <HI>GOD is Love.</HI> And though Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> is plea&s;ed to cen&s;ure the generality of the Church People as having
<PB N="90" REF="006637_0089_10297294E9ECA2B0">little or no Religion; yet &s;o little as we have, if any of us &s;hould abandon him&s;elf to Slander in &s;uch a Manner as he has done, I am confident our People would be per|fectly a&s;hamed of his Writings.</P>
<P>The very <HI>Devil</HI> has his Name from Slandering and fal&s;e Accu&s;ing; and no Sin in the holy Scripture is more &s;everely threatned than this, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> xv. 1. The Que&s;tion is put, <HI>Lord who &s;hall abide in thy Tabernacle? who &s;hall dwell in thy holy Hill?</HI> Part of the An&s;wer is, <HI>He that backbiteth not with his Tongue, nor doth evil to his Neighbour, nor taketh up a Reproach again&s;t his Neighbbour.</HI> In the New Te&s;tament it is expre&s;ly declared, that <HI>Re|vilers &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of</HI> GOD, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 10. St. <HI>Paul</HI> declares that <HI>Railers</HI> or fal&s;e Accu&s;ers are as worthy of Church Cen&s;ures as <HI>Drunkards,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 11. If Di&s;cipline were &s;o carefully u&s;ed among Pre&s;|byterians as Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> pretends, he would certainly feel the Smart of it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But as for you my Brethren and Neighbours, I hope better Things of you; I hope you will not &s;uffer your Minds to be <HI>&s;oured</HI> with his <HI>Leaven.</HI> That we &s;hould be all of one Opinion is rather to be wi&s;hed for, than expected; but that we &s;hould treat each other <HI>fairly,</HI> that we &s;hould not &s;peak evil one of another, but pro|mote each others Comfort and Happine&s;s, is what we all acknowledge to be right. No Difference of Opinion can excu&s;e us, if we violate the common Rules of Ju&s;|tice and Humanity. <HI>Mala.</HI> xi. 10. <HI>Have we not all one Father? hath not one GOD created us? why do we deal treacherou&s;ly every Man again&s;t his Brother. Let us love as Brethren, let us follow Peace with all Men,</HI> and the GOD of Love and Peace will be with us.</P>
<P>And though you, or we, may at la&s;t be found to have lived in &s;ome <HI>Mi&s;takes;</HI> yet, if it &s;hall appear, that we have uprightly endeavoured to know and do GOD'S

<P>ONE would have thought an ingenuous Mind with any thing of a truly chri&s;tian Temper and Di&s;po|&s;ition, would, upon being mi&s;led into any wrong Repre&s;entations of a Fact injurious to a Neighbour's good Name, be glad to be &s;et right, and ready to repair the Injury. &mdash; But Mr. <HI>Hobart,</HI> it &s;eems is &s;o far from this, that, though I had given a Tran&s;cript of my Letter, clearly &s;ettling the Point, again&s;t what he had in&s;inuated, he has in your's by the la&s;t Po&s;t, done all he could, to e&s;tabli&s;h the odious Character he had given of me, with|out the lea&s;t Truth, or Provocation. &mdash; It would be very ea&s;y to an&s;wer every Line of his long quibbling and im|pertinent Performance, if this were a proper Place for it: But as it is not, I beg leave only ju&s;t to fix him down to the Facts as they really are, and he knows them to be: &mdash; He knows, the only Fact I objected to, was, <Q><HI>That my Son,</HI> (as he would have it,) <HI>continued to draw for his Salary, after he cea&s;ed to do Duty.</HI></Q> &mdash; He knows he had charged this in &s;o many Words, by &s;aying, <Q>This is the Ca&s;e of Dr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI></Q> <HI>viz.</HI> without any Truth, joining others with me in the&s;e Words, <Q><HI>Their Fathers are not &s;o &s;peedy as they &s;hould be,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but &s;ometimes
<PB REF="006637_0092_102972A11EE9A688">let their Pay run on for a Year or two after they have left the Service.</HI></Q> P. 150. <Q>This, &s;ays he, is the Ca&s;e of Dr. <HI>John&s;on.</HI></Q> &mdash; On the other Hand, he now knows, my Son re&s;igned, <HI>March</HI> 25, 1748. i. e. as &s;oon as he concluded to leave the Service, and that it was accepted <HI>June</HI> 23 following. &mdash; Can he or any other Mortal, be &s;o &s;illy as to imagine, he or I would continue to draw after the Term of his Re&s;ignation? I a&s;&s;ure him we never did. &mdash; Can there be a more idle Quibble, than that again&s;t his Re&s;igning <HI>immediately,</HI> after he concluded to follow the Law, that he was pre&s;ent at two or three Courts be|fore, only the better to make a Judgment, whether that Profe&s;&s;ion would be eligible to him; when he knows he never appeared at the Bar, till above half a Year after? &mdash;or than that again&s;t the <HI>Con&s;tancy</HI> of his officiating, that he made a Tour to <HI>Cambridge</HI> in that Time, which it was before agreed he &s;hould? &mdash; Mi&s;erable mu&s;t be the Con|dition of a Man reduced to &s;uch Shifts as the&s;e! &mdash; Is his own very frequent Attendance on the Courts, an Argument that he ought long before now to have re|&s;igned his Salary and the Mini&s;try, and turn'd Lawyer? &mdash; Or is it a rea&s;onable Objection again&s;t his own Con|&s;tancy at <HI>Fairfield,</HI> that he &s;ometimes takes a Ride to <HI>Bo&s;ton?</HI> &mdash; I am &s;orry and a&s;hamed for him, that he &s;hould &s;o very weakly di&s;cover &s;o much Venom! &mdash; Now he would have it thought I impo&s;e on the World in pre|tending the Secretary was ill at the <HI>Bath</HI> about that Time. &mdash; Mu&s;t I then produce another Letter from him &s;ome time after this, thanking GOD for his Recovery, and excu&s;ing, on Account of his late long Sickne&s;s, his not an&s;wering my Letters of <HI>October</HI> 1748, and <HI>March</HI> 1749, and Mr. <HI>Ogilvie</HI>'s Te&s;timony, who was then there, that he was long Sick, and at the <HI>Bath</HI> about that Time? &mdash; Might he not write his Name, and yet not be able to make the Ab&s;tract? &mdash; Or might not the mo&s;t faith|ful Secretary in the World, or Under Secretary be liable to &s;ome little Inadvertencies? &mdash; If Mr. <HI>H&mdash;t</HI> had the lea&s;t Candour he might have been &s;en&s;ible that it was to
<PB REF="006637_0093_102972A2A977B130">this, and not to his Ab&s;ence, that I a&s;cribed <HI>Ripton</HI>'s be|ing called a neighbouring Town. &mdash; And now as to the School, can the Society be &s;aid to be impo&s;ed upon, when Mr. <HI>Browne</HI> for &pound;. 15, takes Care that their School here is faithfully kept, though by another Man, (to which they are knowing,) and that it is done better than he could do it him&s;elf, as the People here account it to be, though for this Care, he retains a &s;mall Part of the Money? &mdash; Whatever Mr. <HI>H&mdash;t</HI> &s;ays, I do not believe any Per&s;on of Veracity ever told him that Mr. <HI>Silby</HI> told him he did it for one third, becau&s;e it never was &s;o, and <HI>Silby</HI> a&s;&s;ures me he never &s;aid &s;o: and I challenge him to pro|duce his veracious Gentleman. &mdash; It is indeed to be la|mented as a Di&s;honour to Chri&s;tianity, that any one who profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel of Peace and Charity, &s;hould (in direct Oppo&s;ition to the Dictates of that Charity which <HI>thinketh no Evil, and hopeth all Things</HI> in favour to our Neighbour) &s;o laboriou&s;ly, from meer Hear&s;ays through three or four Hands, and meer Surmi|zes and Suppo&s;es of his own, endeavour publickly to fa&s;ten the mo&s;t odious Characters on his Brethren, and even Elders (with whom he has no Bu&s;ine&s;s) again&s;t whom the Apo&s;tle forbids even their own Bi&s;hops to take <HI>an Accu&s;ation, but under two or three faithful Witne&s;&s;es.</HI> &mdash; But the Brevity I am obliged to &s;tudy, forbids me to add any more. &mdash; I only pray Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Name may never &s;o gro&s;ly &s;uffer by &s;uch abu&s;ive Mea&s;ures from any one, as I &s;uffer from him. &mdash; And as he has now &s;een the Letter of my Son's Re&s;ignation, and the Secretary's An&s;wer, I can't but hope he will yet have the Ingenuity to retract and do me Ju&s;tice.</P>
