<P>THIS Addre&s;s was de&s;igned ori|ginally only for the U&s;e of the worthy Members of the Author's Church in <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> to whom it was delivered, but it is equally adapt|ed to the pre&s;ent State of the <HI>Ameri|can</HI> Colonies in general. A few Things have been added for this Pur|po&s;e, but Nothing material has been omitted. The Author's De&s;ign, in publi&s;hing, was to oblige his Friends, who advi&s;ed it, and to do &s;ome Good to his Country.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> from who&s;e Lamentations our Text is taken, lived to &s;ee the Ruin of his Nation. His patriotic Soul glowed with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic Love for his Country, and he felt all her Mi&s;eries by Anticipation. The Man &s;uffers doubly who&s;e Eyes are open to fore&s;ee future Calamities. This holy Patriot's Heart was broken long before the Mi&s;eries, which he bewails, came upon his Countrymen; in&s;o|much that it is difficult to tell which is the mo&s;t melancholy, his Prophecy or his Hi&s;tory of the De&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> His La|mentations were evidently written with a Pen dipped in Tears. Every Line is full of Sor|row, and every Word &s;eems big with Di&s;tre&s;s. But in the Mid&s;t of his Complaints we find that
<PB N="6" REF="013649_0004_0F919CAC2B566BE0">he ju&s;tifies GOD, and confe&s;&s;es that it is becau&s;e his Compa&s;&s;ions fail not, that they are not <HI>entirely</HI> con&s;umed. Afflictions, whether public or private, always bring good Men to a Sen&s;e of their Sins, and the fir&s;t Efforts of their Re&s;entments are again&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>POLITICAL Subjects do not belong to the Pulpit, but to direct to a right Improvement of the Times is the Duty of every Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel. An unnatural Di&s;pute hath ari&s;en between <HI>Britain</HI> and the <HI>American</HI> Co|lonies, and the Que&s;tion is of no le&s;s Mag|nitude than whether we &s;hall continue to en|joy the Privileges of Men and <HI>Britons,</HI> or whether we &s;hall be reduced to a State of the mo&s;t abject Slavery. It is equally beyond my Province and Inclination to enter into the Merits of this Controver&s;y. It will be &s;uffi|cient for my Purpo&s;e to remark, that we have lived to &s;ee our Country involved in a common Calamity. The Cry of Oppre&s;&s;ion is already heard in one Corner of our Land. The Groans of many Thou&s;ands of our Brethren have reached our Ears, and GOD only knows how &s;oon they will be echoed back from every Part of the Continent. A dark Cloud hovers over us. We are threatened with Slavery. War, Pe&s;tilence and Earth|quakes, tho&s;e ordinary Mini&s;ters of GOD's Vengeance, are tran&s;ient, partial or local Evils. Slavery is a general and perpetual Evil. It includes all Ages, Cla&s;&s;es and Sexes.
<PB N="7" REF="013649_0005_0F919CAC9639D990">It reaches to every Corner of a Land. It in|cludes the pre&s;ent and all future Generations. It precludes all Hopes of Redre&s;s, for it en|tails tho&s;e Crimes and that Depravity of Soul which at fir&s;t procured it. In a Word, it is the prime Mini&s;ter of GOD's Vengeance, and it has been called upon only in tho&s;e Ca&s;es where le&s;s Scourges were unequal to the Demerit of Crimes, or when they had been u&s;ed to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Dictates of blind Pa&s;&s;ion are to imprecate Vengeance upon the guilty In&s;tru|ments of our Calamities, and to re&s;olve to endure the greate&s;t Hard&s;hips rather than &s;ur|render the Privileges we have derived from Nature and our Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>IT is true, the impartial Judge of the World will vindicate the Cau&s;e of the op|pre&s;&s;ed, and although in righteous Judgment he may leave them to &s;ink under the Load of their Oppre&s;&s;ions, yet will he not forget the Oppre&s;&s;or. He hath a&s;&s;ured us in his Word, that he will "vindicate the Poor, and break in Pieces the Oppre&s;&s;or. This is the Portion of the wicked Man with God, and the He|ritage of the Oppre&s;&s;ors, which they &s;hall re|ceive of the Almighty. If his Children be multiplied, it is for the Sword, and his Off|&s;pring &s;hall not be &s;atisfied with Bread. Tho&s;e that remain of him &s;hall be buried in Death, and his Widow &s;hall not weep. Tho' he heap up Silver as Du&s;t, and prepare Raiment
<PB N="8" REF="013649_0006_0F919CAD53739188">as Clay, yet &s;hall the ju&s;t put it on, and the innocent &s;hall divide the Silver. He buildeth his Hou&s;e as a Moth, and as a Booth that the Keeper maketh. The rich Man &s;hall lie down, but he &s;hall not be gathered. He openeth his Eyes, and he is not. Terrors take hold of him as Waters. A Tempe&s;t &s;tealeth him away in the Night; for GOD &s;hall ca&s;t upon him, and &s;hall not &s;pare. He would fain flee out of his Hand. Men &s;hall clap their Hands at him, and &s;hall hi&s;s him out of his Place."</P>
<P>NOR is the U&s;e of Means to obtain Relief from our Oppre&s;&s;ions incon&s;i&s;tent with the nece&s;&s;ary Principles of human Nature, or con|trary to the Word of GOD. But there is too much Rea&s;on to fear, that while we exclaim again&s;t the In&s;truments of our Calamities, and deliberate about the be&s;t Mea&s;ures to ex|tricate our&s;elves from them, we forget to ex|claim again&s;t the prevailing Iniquities of our Country, and to con&s;ider them as the only Cau&s;es which have drawn down the Frowns of Omnipotence upon us. The Experience of all Ages &s;hews that the &s;ure&s;t Way for any Nation to obtain or perpetuate public Ble&s;&s;ings, is to acknowledge that GOD who alone can be&s;tow them. It was never known, that a People became unhappy until their Iniquities ripened them for the divine Vengeance. The Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation is, in this Re|&s;pect, a &s;triking Le&s;&s;on to all Mankind. Their
<PB N="9" REF="013649_0007_0F919CB022F83D70">Piety and Pro&s;perity always kept Pace with each other, and their Defection from GOD was always a Prelude to their De&s;olation.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be an invariable Rule with <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to regard the Hand of GOD in every Thing which happens, but e&s;pecially in public Calamities. Not a Blade of Gra&s;s is trodden down, nor does a Hair fall from your Heads without his Notice. He over|rules likewi&s;e the grand Machine of the Uni|ver&s;e, and however confu&s;ed it may appear, yet let <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> remember that there is Order in this Confu&s;ion. Not one Event is vain, and God's Glory will be the Re&s;ult of the va&s;t Combination.</P>
<P>THE corrupt Pa&s;&s;ions of Men, while they aim only at their own Gratification, are the Means whereby God accompli&s;hes his Pur|po&s;es in the Government of the World. Even the Wrath of Man, the mo&s;t malevolent of all Pa&s;&s;ions, "worketh his Will." Devils follow the Malignity of their Natures in all their Actions, but the Almighty carries on, through their In&s;trumentality, the mo&s;t va|luable Purpo&s;es of his Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>NATIONS, like Individuals, have their Vices, which call for Puni&s;hment. The Vices of Individuals are &s;eldom fully puni&s;hed in this World, but it is in this World only that GOD has erected a Tribunal for the Trial and Puni&s;hment of national Vices. As Individuals have their Day beyond which
<PB N="10" REF="013649_0008_0F919CB04A5F6D10">GOD's Patience will not wait, &s;o likewi&s;e have Nations. Though he may forbear long, yet the Time <HI>will</HI> come when he will either reduce them to Obedience, or utterly de|&s;troy them. The Mea&s;ure of the Iniquity of the <HI>Amorites</HI> was more than four hundred Years in filling up, but at length it was full, and they were de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>THERE can be no Sign of a Nation's ap|proaching De&s;truction more certain than its univer&s;al Corruption. Ten pious Souls might have &s;aved <HI>Sodom,</HI> and the other Cities of the Plain, from Fire and Sulphur, but many more might not have &s;aved them from &s;ome heavy Judgments. We cannot certainly tell when the Day of Vengeance will come, yet we have always Rea&s;on to fear it; and it becomes us in a particular Manner, when we behold the Hand of GOD lifted up, to tremble and bow down before him.</P>
<P>IF we examine the religious and moral Character of the Inhabitants of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire, we have the utmo&s;t Rea&s;on to con|clude that a Time of general Correction is not far from us. Our Lord found Fault with the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> of his Day for being blind to the Signs of the Times. When we behold the we&s;tern Sky red in the Evening, we ex|pect a fair Day. When we behold the Fields yellow, we know that Harve&s;t is at Hand. The&s;e Signs, in the natural World, are not le&s;s certain and invariable than the Sign of uni|ver&s;al
<PB N="11" REF="013649_0009_0F919CB14BD97E38">moral Depravity in a People being a Prelude to their De&s;truction. GOD has not thrown the Reins of the Univer&s;e out of his Hands, nor will he leave the World to go on at Random. Good Men, who have made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to find out and bewail the Ini|quities of our Nation and Country, have been, for Years pa&s;t, looking for &s;ome great and di&s;|mal Cata&s;trophe to befal them. The Words of our Text form a Part of their daily Confe&s;|&s;ions: "It is of the Lord's Mercy that we are not con&s;umed, becau&s;e his Compa&s;&s;ions fail not."</P>
<P>IN order to illu&s;trate the Truth of the Pro|po&s;ition contained in our Text, I &s;hall point out in a few Words the religious and moral Character of our Nation and Country. It will be nece&s;&s;ary to include the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation in this Picture, as their Liberty and Happine&s;s are as much at Stake as the Liberty and Happine&s;s of the Colonies in the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y.</P>
<P>WE cannot &s;urvey the <HI>religious</HI> Character of our Nation and Country without complaining, in the fir&s;t Place, of the univer&s;al Prevalence of Infidelity. It has infected not only our re|clu&s;e Philo&s;ophers, but every Rank and Pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Even the Coxcomb and Petit Maitre affect to treat the Chri&s;tian Revelation with Ridicule. It is &s;ome Con&s;olation to reflect that this Evil will in Time cure it&s;elf, for the principled Infidel will &s;oon be a&s;hamed of Opinions which are now no longer &s;ingular,
<PB N="12" REF="013649_0010_0F919CB1C7DAB248">and which cea&s;e to rai&s;e him above the mo&s;t vulgar and contemptible Part of Mankind.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;trange Here&s;ies prevail in our Na|tional Churches! What a general Defection from Articles and Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith! What in&s;idious Interpretations of the Word of God! There cannot be a more awful Sign of our general Corruption than this Treachery in the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel! How little do we find even of the <HI>Form</HI> of Religion among us! I do not mean here that there are few who go to Church, or have their Children bapti&s;ed, or call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians. There was a Time indeed when the&s;e Things were con&s;i|dered as true Badges of the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;|&s;ion, but in our wi&s;er Age the very Ideas of the&s;e things are changed. They are now con|&s;idered only as Matters of Cu&s;tom, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es are complied with only to &s;ecure a Title to an E&s;tate, or as legal Qualifications for holding civil Offices.</P>
<P>How few are there that keep the Incen&s;e of Prayer daily &s;moking in their Families! The Heathens had their Lares and Penates. The Want of Family Wor&s;hip would have been e&s;teemed a Mark of the Want of Religion in ancient <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>How &s;hamefully is the religious In&s;truction of our Children neglected in this Country. It is one of tho&s;e new Paradoxes in which the pre&s;ent Age is fruitful, that the Mind &s;hould be left unprincipled in Religion, until it is
<PB N="13" REF="013649_0011_0F919CB281146DA0">able to choo&s;e a Sy&s;tem for it&s;elf. It would be an Affront to your Under&s;tandings to &s;how the Ab&s;urdity of this Conduct. Would to God there was the &s;ame Zeal among us to tran&s;mit to our Children the Religion, as there is to tran&s;mit the Liberty we derived from our pi|ous Ance&s;tors!</P>
<P>How little do we find of the Influence of the Go&s;pel among tho&s;e whom Charity obliges us to hope are real <HI>Chri&s;tians!</HI> Lukewarmne&s;s has taken the Place of Zeal, and there is little to di&s;tingui&s;h the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> from the re&s;t of the World. The Love of GOD has waxed cold in many, and if our Nation and Country were to be judged by the Con|duct of GOD's People alone, we &s;hould have Rea&s;on to forebode the mo&s;t dreadful Cala|mities. Yes, my <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Friends, I am &s;ure you &s;ub&s;cribe to our Text with Re&s;pect to your|&s;elves, "that it is of the Lord's Mercies that you are not con&s;umed."</P>
<P>LET us now examine the <HI>moral</HI> Character of our Nation and Country.</P>
<P>FORMERLY Vices were de&s;cribed by the Cla&s;&s;es of Mankind to which they belonged, but we find they have &s;pread them&s;elves &s;o univer&s;ally among all Ranks in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire, that we can no longer de&s;cribe them in that Manner.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall begin by mentioning the univer&s;al Profanation of the Sabbath Day. This is a true Mark of national Impiety, and hence we
<PB N="14" REF="013649_0012_0F919CB347E9C990">find that it never was forgotten when the <HI>Jews</HI> were reproached, or puni&s;hed for their national Sins. The Sabbath is now the fixed Day with &s;ome for Entertainments and Jaunts of Plea&s;ure, as being mo&s;t free from the Inter|ruptions of Company, and the Inconveni|ence of meeting the ordinary Vehicles of Bu&s;ine&s;s. The Merchant is now no longer a&s;hamed to own in Company, that he &s;pends his Sabbath in po&s;ting his Books, or writing his Letters. I mu&s;t not except here the Manner in which public Wor&s;hip is performed among us from being a Profanation of the Lord's Day. A Gentleman would think you injured him greatly if you took his going to Church as a Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, or his &s;aying AMEN as an Evidence of his Belief in the Prayers of the Church. Surely it is of the Lord's Mer|cies that we are not con&s;umed for this Crime!</P>
<P>HOW much does &s;wearing and cur&s;ing abound, and how often is the &s;acred and eter|nal NAME profaned among us. Formerly this was the Vice of <HI>low Life</HI> only, but it has now infected the Army, the Navy, the Bar, the Court, and every Order of Men in the higher Ranks of Society. Formerly it was a Vice of the Men only, but it is now common to both Sexes. An affecting Story, a Fly, or any other In&s;ect, will &s;ometimes produce Ex|clamations from our Ladies, which are equally &s;hocking to Religion and Delicacy. I might here enter into a Detail of the Abu&s;e of Oaths
<PB N="15" REF="013649_0013_0F919CB532CFB890">in tho&s;e Ca&s;es where Government has made them lawful and nece&s;&s;ary. It will only be &s;ufficient to name the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, our Courts of Ju&s;tice, and our popular Elections, to remind us that general Perjury belongs to the Catalogue of our national Crimes. It is indeed of the Lord's Mercy that we are not con&s;umed!</P>
<P>DRUNKENNESS, and Intemperance in eat|ing and drinking, form another Cla&s;s of our Vices. It would take up too much Time to &s;how the mi&s;chievous Effects of the&s;e Sins upon our Souls, Bodies, Families, and upon Society in general. When we reflect upon the univer&s;al Prevalence of this Vice in this Country in particular, we have Rea&s;on to &s;ay, that it is becau&s;e the Compa&s;&s;ions of the Lord fail not, that we are not con&s;umed!</P>
<P>LET me here draw a Veil over the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> Vices of our Nation and Country. I &s;hall not poi&s;on your Imaginations by going into a Detail of what the Eye of GOD beholds covered only by the Curtain of Night. It would profane the Pulpit to mention &s;ome of the&s;e Crimes. If <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> if <HI>Ze|boim</HI> and <HI>Admah</HI> in the untaught Ages of the World had Showers of burning Sulphur rain|ed down upon them, it is &s;urely of the Lord's Mercy that our Cities, our Ne&s;ts of Iniquity, are not con&s;umed!</P>
<P>TALK not of the public Charities of our Nation and Country. The highe&s;t Monu|ments,
<PB N="16" REF="013649_0014_0F919CB593992E70">we can erect to the Honour of Charity, can never atone for that general Want of Piety, Sobriety, Ju&s;tice, and Cha&s;tity which characte|rize us.</P>
<P>I conclude our religious and moral Charac|ter, therefore, by agreeing with tho&s;e who de|clare that Infidelity, Irreligion, Venality, and Vices of every Kind, have never prevailed in a greater Degree, and cannot well ri&s;e to a higher Pitch than they have lately gained in our Na|tion and Country. They prevailed, it is true, in a great Degree, in the di&s;&s;olute Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, but they were confined chiefly to the Channel of the Court. The middle and lower Cla&s;&s;es of People, and the Inhabitants of Villages and Country Places continued Strangers to them. But this cannot be &s;aid of the pre&s;ent Generation. Our com|mon and Country People &s;eem to vie with the fir&s;t Cla&s;&s;es of Mankind in Vices, which were formerly peculiar to them alone.</P>
<P>IF there is any Virtue in the <HI>American</HI> Co|lonies, or laudable Attention to divine Things among every Cla&s;s of People, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed that they are to be found chiefly in that Colony where GOD has begun to lay his Hand upon us. It is true they have degene|rated greatly from the Piety, and pure Man|ners of their Ance&s;tors, but &s;till I am bold to &s;ay, from my own Knowledge, that there is more Appearance of the Go&s;pel in <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> than in any other of the Colonies. And if
<PB N="17" REF="013649_0015_0F919CB6676A0EB0">"Judgment has begun at the Hou&s;e of GOD," what more dreadful Calamities await tho&s;e who have no Pretence to the Character of his Peo|ple! Lord enter not into Judgment with us!</P>
<P>WHEN we take a Survey of all the Circum|&s;tances which aggravate our Guilt, we have Rea&s;on to be confounded. Our Light, Mercies and Privileges have been &s;uperior to tho&s;e of almo&s;t any People on the Face of the Earth. The Sun of Pro&s;perity has &s;hone without a Cloud on our <HI>American</HI> Hemi&s;phere. GOD has given us a fruitful Soil, plentiful Harve&s;ts, profitable Commerce, free Governments, and repeated Victories over the <HI>native</HI> Enemies of our Country; and to all the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings of Nature and Society he has added the Go&s;pel of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> The Trea&s;ures of Heaven have been exhau&s;ted for us. Our Crimes, there|fore, have been committed again&s;t the great&s;t Profu&s;ions of Love and Grace. Surely it is becau&s;e "GOD's Compa&s;&s;ions fail not," or we &s;hould long ago have been con&s;umed for &s;uch unparalleled Ingratitude!</P>
<P>BUT further, &s;hould you a&s;k, why is the Blow which is aimed at our Liberties &s;o long delayed? Why is the Sword of civil War &s;till at re&s;t in its Scabbard? Why are not our Cities in Flames, and our Streets &s;treaming with Blood, and why is not the Yoke of Bon|dage riverted on our Necks? I an&s;wer once more, it is becau&s;e the Compa&s;&s;ions of the Lord have not failed towards us!</P>
<PB N="18" REF="013649_0016_0F919CB740C68838">
<P>WHEN the mere Politician weighs the Dan|ger or the Safety of his Country, he com|putes them in Proportion to its Fortre&s;&s;es, Arms, Money, Provi&s;ions, Numbers of fight|ing Men, and its Enemies; but when the Chri&s;tian Patriot weighs the Danger and Safe|ty of his Country, he computes them by its Numbers of &s;inful or praying People, and its Degrees of Holine&s;s and Vice. It is not the Threats or Boa&s;tings of our Adver&s;aries, that &s;hould make Melancholy &s;it upon our Coun|tenances. We have more to dread from our Iniquities than our Enemies.</P>
<P>I Do not mean to propo&s;e in a little Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;embly, Mea&s;ures of Reformation to be a|dopted by a whole Nation and Country. It will be more to our Purpo&s;e to mention the Duty of Individuals upon this alarming Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>CONFESSION, PRAYER, and REFORMA|TION, are Duties to which every Individual is called, as well for the Welfare of his Country, as for the Sake of his own Salvation. Say not that you are but one, and can do Nothing.&mdash;It is of &s;ingle Per&s;ons that Kingdoms are com|po&s;ed, and that Argument pleads equally again&s;t all Reformations. If you cannot &s;ave your Country, is it not worth while to &s;ave your Souls?</P>
<P>GOD will ever be a Shield to the Righte|ous, to cover them in the Day of Trouble. It is &s;aid that few or no <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> peri&s;hed in the De&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Per&s;onal Re|formation
<PB N="19" REF="013649_0017_0F919CBBAA0CB988">gives per&s;onal Safety; and if GOD does not find a Way for the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>'s entire E&s;cape in a Time of Calamity, yet he will make that very Calamity the Means of en|larging his Happine&s;s; and Death it&s;elf the immediate Door to Glory.</P>
<P>CONFESSION is the fir&s;t Step to Safety. A Sen&s;e of our Crimes is a hopeful Dawn of Deliverance. And here I cannot help repeat|ing a Pa&s;&s;age of a Letter which I lately re|ceived from an aged Servant of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> whom it becomes me to revere; "If (&s;ays my honoured Corre&s;pondent) I could hear our People exclaim again&s;t their Sins as warm|ly as again&s;t Lord <HI>North,</HI> I &s;hould have Hopes of Deliverance. Alas, they hug their Crimes while they decry the Executioner! Were we as harmonious in our Remon&s;trances again&s;t our&s;elves, as we are again&s;t the late oppre&s;&s;ive Acts, our Ca&s;e would not be &s;o doubtful!"</P>
<P>LET us then bow down before the Hand of GOD, and confe&s;s our Iniquities with the deepe&s;t Pro&s;tration of Heart. In three Days (without Repentance) <HI>Nineveh</HI> would have been de&s;troyed. It will be impo&s;&s;ible to bring us to the Feet of a boa&s;ting Mini&s;ter of State, if we fir&s;t humble our&s;elves properly at the Feet of the Lord.</P>
<P>PRAYER to ALMIGHTY GOD is a powerful Defence again&s;t public Calamities. This is a Duty not of more private than pub|lic Benefit. To whom does Nature or Re|velation
<PB N="20" REF="013649_0018_0F919CBD0B6AAF08">encourage us to go in all Times of Di&s;tre&s;s but to him who holds the Hearts of Kings in his Hands, and wields the Sceptre of the Univer&s;e. It can be the Bu&s;ine&s;s of but a &s;mall Part of our Community to plan Schemes for our Deliverance, but we may all co-operate in the Duty of Prayer; and let the Chri&s;tian Patriot remember, that in an Age and Country when Petitions and Remon|&s;trances to earthly Rulers have lo&s;t their Effi|cacy, Prayer to GOD &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, an Almighty Efficacy. The Pray|er of one Man once &s;aved a City devoted to De&s;truction; and it is not attributing too much to it to add, that the Prayers of one Chri&s;tian Society may yet &s;ave our &s;inking Country.</P>
<P>BUT in vain are Confe&s;&s;ions and Prayers, unle&s;s we turn from our evil Ways by a thorough Reformation. To this the Go&s;pel of our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> calls you at the Peril of your Souls, as well as of your Country. To this every Motive from Heaven, Earth, and Hell invites you. A general Reforma|tion, my Brethren, would be a greater Act of Benevolence to our &s;uffering Brethren in the North than all your generous and &s;pirit|ed Contributions. Take GOD, therefore, for your GOD, and become the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and be a&s;&s;ured of Safety here, and of Crowns of immortal Glory hereafter.</P>
