<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Compliance with your De&s;ire, in which &s;ome others of my worthy Friends have joined with you, I now &s;end you my Tho'ts on a Que&s;tion which you have propo&s;ed to me. And this I do, not only that I may gratify you and them; but al&s;o becau&s;e I think the Que&s;tion propo&s;ed to be of very con&s;iderable Importance; and am in Hopes that a ju&s;t An&s;wer to it may be of &s;ome Service.</P>
<P>The QUESTION is,</P>
<P><HI>Whether</HI> COMMON <HI>and</HI> SAVING GRACE <HI>do</HI> SPECI|FICALLY DIFFER <HI>one from the other, or</HI> GRADU|ALLY <HI>only?</HI></P>
<P>Now, Sir, This Que&s;tion needs not to have, much &s;aid for the Explanation of it.</P>
<P>By <HI>Grace</HI> here (waving all other Acceptations of the Word) I under&s;tand <HI>that which is</HI> QUALITATIVE, <HI>or &s;uch</HI> QUALIFICATIONS <HI>freely given by God to Men, as they are made the better by.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>common</HI> Grace, I under&s;tand &s;uch as <HI>Per&s;ons may be made the Subjects of, and yet never be &s;aved:</HI> But by <HI>&s;av|ing</HI> Grace, I under&s;tand &s;uch <HI>Gifts or Qualifications only, as tho&s;e who &s;hall be eternally &s;aved, are made Partakers of.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006008_0003_1027153D836B2EE0">By the differing of the&s;e two <HI>&s;pecifically</HI> one from the other, I under&s;tand their <HI>differing as Things of differing Natures or Kinds</HI> do, as Silver and Gold &amp;c. But by their differing <HI>gradually</HI> only, I intend their differing only as Things of the &s;ame Nature or Kind may do in <HI>Quantity;</HI> and thus a great deal of Silver or Gold differ|eth from a little: Or in <HI>Degree;</HI> and thus one Man has a greater Degree of Strength or Wi&s;dom than another, tho' of the very &s;ame Kind.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I under&s;tand your Que&s;tion; and I think that a due Re&s;olution of it depends very much upon a right An&s;wer to another, namely, <HI>Whether Mankind have by their fir&s;t and great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in</HI> Adam, <HI>their common Head, wholly lo&s;t all their Power to perform any Acts of Obedience unto God in a gracious or truly holy Manner, &s;o as not to be able to wor&s;hip or &s;erve the ble&s;&s;ed God, or pur&s;ue the great End of their Being, without God's giving them new Powers?</HI> For if this be Man's Ca&s;e &s;ince the Fall, then I think &s;uch Grace mu&s;t be be&s;towed on him, in order to his Recovery out of this Condition, as will in &s;ome Mea&s;ure re&s;tore the Powers he has lo&s;t, and as will put him in a Capacity to &s;erve God acceptably, and of enjoying a happy Communion with him: But if, on the other Hand, Mankind have not lo&s;t the Power above de&s;cribed, tho' it &s;hould be granted that they are become di&s;inclined unto Good, and prone and di&s;po&s;ed to &s;in again&s;t God, &s;o as to &s;tand in need of powerful Motives to excite them to their Duty, yet they need not &s;uch a Kind of Grace, as on the other Suppo&s;ition they do, but moral Grace (as &s;ome call it) or moral Swa|&s;ion will &s;uffice.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, being per&s;waded that Mankind have by their Fall lo&s;t all their Power to perform Actions that are &s;piritually good and holy, or of living unto God in &s;uch a Manner as they &s;hould do, they mu&s;t, I think, in
<PB N="7" REF="006008_0004_1027153F1A95DCC8">
order hereunto have <HI>another Kind of Grace</HI> given to them, than on the contrary Suppo&s;ition they can be ju&s;tly &s;up|po&s;ed to need.</P>
<P>My An&s;wer therefore to your Que&s;tion is, That there is a <HI>&s;pecifical Difference</HI> between <HI>common</HI> and <HI>&s;aving</HI> Grace, and they differ not <HI>gradually,</HI> or in <HI>Degree</HI> only.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e it is generally acknowledged among us, that Man has by his Fall lo&s;t all his Power to &s;erve God in a gracious and holy Manner; and becau&s;e I hope that you, Sir, be not in Doubt of this, I &s;hall in a <HI>Manner</HI> take the &s;ame for granted; yet I &s;hall, for the Sake of <HI>others</HI> &s;ay <HI>&s;omething</HI> for the confirming of it in a few &s;hort Hints, which will ca&s;t &s;ome Light on it.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Puni&s;hment threatned in the Covenant of Works, which God at fir&s;t entred into with Mankind in <HI>Adam,</HI> Gene&s;is 2.16, 17. while in Innocency, did un|doubtedly comprize <HI>&s;piritual Death</HI> in it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> con&s;i&s;ted in Man's <HI>Lo&s;s of the Image of God,</HI> in which he was created, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.26, 27. Man's Life, before the Fall, con&s;i&s;ted in his Integrity, or Uprightne&s;s, <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 7.29. <HI>God made Man upright.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Death threatned in the fir&s;t Covenant accord|ingly <HI>&s;eized</HI> on all <HI>Adam</HI>'s Po&s;terity, (in the Way of ordi|nary Generation) as appears in <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.19. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 21, 22. <HI>Job</HI> 25.4. and Chap. 14. 4. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.5. with which Texts do well agree the Words of our Saviour in Joh. 3.6. <HI>That which is born of the Fle&s;h is Fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. All Mankind are accordingly &s;ince their Fall, <HI>re|pre&s;ented</HI> as &s;piritually dead, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.1. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.13. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.15. <HI>If one died for all, then were all dead:</HI> But that Chri&s;t died for all is in the next Words affirmed, <HI>ver.</HI> 16.</P>
<P N="4">4. One Thing intended by Mens being dead in Sin is their being <HI>without Strength,</HI> Rom. 5.6. <HI>For when we were yet without Strength, in due Time Chri&s;t died for
<PB N="8" REF="006008_0005_10271541CB05EE10">
the Ungodly.</HI> Now by this, Man's <HI>utter Inability</HI> to know and &s;erve God in a &s;piritual Manner is intended, as ap|pears in Rom. 8.6, 7, 8. <HI>For to be carnally minded is Death, but to be &s;piritually minded is Life and Peace: Becau&s;e the carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t God; for it not &s;ubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the Fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God.</HI> To the &s;ame Purpo&s;e is that, in 1 Cor. 2.14. <HI>But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God: for they are Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</HI> With tho&s;e Places the Words of our Saviour do well agree, in Luk. 6.43, 44. <HI>For a good Tree bringeth not forth corrupt Fruit; neither doth a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit; for every Tree is known by his own Fruit; for of Thorns Men do not gather Figs, nor of a bramble Bu&s;h gather they Grapes.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. It is evident that Man's Power to do well, which he lo&s;t by his Fall is (in Part) <HI>re&s;tored</HI> to him in his Re|generation. Of this we are plainly informed in Scrip|ture, as in 1 Joh. 3.9. <HI>Who&s;oever is born of God doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him; and he cannot Sin becau&s;e he is born of God.</HI> Al&s;o in Chap. 5. 4. <HI>For what&s;oever is born of God overcometh the World.</HI> Compare with the&s;e Texts, Eph. 2.10. <HI>For we are his Workman|&s;hip created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works, which God hath before ordained, that we &s;hould walk in them.</HI> And Chap. 4.23, 24. <HI>And be renewed in the Spirit of your Mind. And put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s.</HI> The &s;ame, in Effect, we have in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26, 27. and <HI>Deut.</HI> 30.6.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that Sinners mu&s;t have new Powers given them, before they can in a holy Manner live unto God as they &s;hould do; and that moral Sua&s;ion cannot &s;upply what is wanting unto this End.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006008_0006_1027154360C5E480">The&s;e Things being premi&s;ed, I &s;hall proceed now, Sir, to offer, the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> of my Opinion in the Point un|der Con&s;ideration. And they are &s;uch as here follow.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="reason">
<HEAD>REASON I.</HEAD>
<P>My fir&s;t Rea&s;on is from the great <HI>Improbability</HI> of the Suppo&s;ition I oppo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> that tho&s;e whom God <HI>eternally &s;aves,</HI> have no <HI>Qualifications,</HI> by him be&s;towed on them, which are in <HI>their Kind</HI> any <HI>better,</HI> than <HI>tho&s;e be&s;towed</HI> by him on many that he <HI>&s;uffers to die in their Sins and peri&s;h for ever.</HI> He is &s;uppo&s;ed indeed to give unto tho&s;e whom he &s;aves <HI>larger Mea&s;ures of Grace of the &s;ame Kind</HI> than he gives to tho&s;e that die in their Sins, but <HI>not</HI> Things that are in <HI>their Nature at all better.</HI> How contrary is this to that &s;poken to &s;uch as were &s;uppo&s;ed truly to be|lieve, Heb. 6.9. <HI>But, Beloved, we are per&s;waded better Things of you, and Things that accompany Salvation, tho' we thus &s;peak.</HI> By <HI>better Things,</HI> we mu&s;t here under|&s;tand &s;uch as are <HI>better than God be&s;tows on any whom he does not &s;ave,</HI> and better than tho&s;e <HI>ju&s;t before mentioned</HI> in Ver&s;es 4, 5, 6. How good &s;oever they may &s;eem to be.</P>
<P>Here I would a&s;k (1) Is it at all credible that God be|&s;tows no better inherent Endowments upon tho&s;e he free|ly ju&s;tifies by his Grace thro' the Redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and reconciles to him&s;elf, than on tho&s;e who remain in a State of Condemnation, and have the Wrath of God abiding on them for ever? (2) Again, Is not that Grace which is be&s;towed on tho&s;e that are &s;aved, be&s;towed unto this End, that they may be there|by made <HI>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light?</HI> And if &s;o, can we think that this is of no better a Kind than God often be&s;tows on tho&s;e who will be the Monu|ments of his Wrath for ever? Can we, I &s;ay, think it likely that God be&s;tows no Gifts, in their Nature and
<PB N="10" REF="006008_0007_10271547648C5A90">
Kind, better on the former of the&s;e, than on the other? The very Suppo&s;ition of this, carries &s;o much Ab&s;ur|dity in it, that it &s;eems &s;trange to me that any will try to defend it. Indeed, I my &s;elf think, that God does not qualify any with &s;aving Holine&s;s before he ju&s;tifies them: But that he never be&s;tows any <HI>better Kind of Grace</HI> on tho&s;e whom he &s;aves, than he be&s;tows on &s;ome that pe|ri&s;h, but only <HI>different Degrees of Grace</HI> of the <HI>&s;ame Kind,</HI> I at pre&s;ent think not. I believe that God be&s;tows a better Kind of Grace on tho&s;e whom he eternally &s;aves, than that Sort which Sinners may, or may not, <HI>receive in vain,</HI> 2 Cor. 6.1.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="reason">
<HEAD>REASON II.</HEAD>
<P>My &s;econd Rea&s;on to prove a <HI>&s;pecific Difference</HI> be|tween <HI>common</HI> and <HI>&s;aving</HI> Grace, I &s;hall take from &s;ome <HI>plain Intimations which we have of &s;uch a Difference</HI> in &s;everal Texts of Scripture. Such a Difference is in|timated or imported in 1 Cor. 2.14, 15. <HI>But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God; for they are Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned. But he that is &s;piritual judged all Things, yet he him&s;elf is judged of no Man.</HI> So again in Colo&s;. 1.9. <HI>That ye might be filled with the Know|ledge of his Will in all Wi&s;dom and &s;piritual Under&s;tanding.</HI> Again, in Prov. 9.10. <HI>The Fear of the Lord is the Begin|ning of Wi&s;dom; and the Knowledge of the Holy is Under|&s;tanding.</HI> Thus &s;aving Faith is called the <HI>Faith of God's Elect,</HI> Tit. 1.1. no Doubt to &s;hew that this is a Faith of a different Kind from any which the Non-Elect may have. For the like Rea&s;on we read of <HI>Faith that worketh by Love,</HI> Gal. 5.6. and that <HI>purifieth the Heart,</HI> Act. 15.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. Thus al&s;o the <HI>giving a Cup of cold Water</HI> unto a Per&s;on <HI>in the Name of a Di&s;ciple,</HI> or becau&s;e he belongs to Chri&s;t, is &s;poken of as an Action in its <HI>Nature</HI> gracious or holy, <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 9.41. Thus al&s;o the gracious Nature of <HI>Peter</HI>'s
<PB N="11" REF="006008_0008_1027154B23A7D690">
Faith, was by our Lord taken Notice of, Math. 16.17. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed art thou Simon Bar-jona, for Fle&s;h and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> With which plea&s;e to compare, Joh. 1.13. For this Pur|po&s;e al&s;o I think is that, Zech. 7.5. <HI>When ye fa&s;ted and mourned in the fifth and &s;eventh Month, even tho&s;e &s;eventy Years, did ye at all fa&s;t unto me, even to me?</HI> Al&s;o that, 1 Cor. 10.31. <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what|&s;oever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> Per&s;ons may be by <HI>common Grace</HI> excited to perform Things that are <HI>ma|terially Good,</HI> and yet not exerci&s;e <HI>&s;aving Grace</HI> in their Performance of them. Thus the Offering of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel</HI> were not in their Nature alike. Heb. 11.4. <HI>By Faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent Sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained Witne&s;s that he was righteous, God te&s;tifying of his Gifts, and by it he being dead, yet &s;peaketh.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="reason">
<HEAD>REASON III.</HEAD>
<P>My third Rea&s;on is becau&s;e it appears by Scripture, that <HI>God works in a very different Manner</HI> in the Production of <HI>&s;aving Grace,</HI> from the Way of his Working in the Production of that which is <HI>common:</HI> As I &s;uppo&s;e there is a great Difference in Re&s;pect of <HI>Nature or Kind</HI> between common and &s;aving Grace, &s;o the <HI>Way of God's working in the Production</HI> of the&s;e is very different.</P>
<P>This may be cleared up by con&s;idering the Way of God's working in the Production of <HI>each</HI> of the&s;e &s;everally.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, I will begin with the Way of God's work|ing <HI>&s;aving Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Now it appears by Scripture that this Kind of Grace is wrought by an <HI>immediate Act of God's Power,</HI> and &s;o in a Way <HI>&s;upernatural.</HI> This I think is plainly a&s;&s;erted, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.13. Where we are told concerning true Believers, that they were <HI>born, not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fle&s;h, but of God.</HI> They are not begotten &amp; born by any
<PB N="12" REF="006008_0009_1026E0C3222760B0">
<HI>natural Means,</HI> or <HI>human Power,</HI> but <HI>according to the Will of God,</HI> and by his <HI>Power only.</HI> And thus are all true Saints born of God, and <HI>none</HI> but &s;uch, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.3. &amp; Ver. 5. And 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.9. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 5.1. Now in being thus begotten and born they mu&s;t needs be wholly <HI>pa&s;&s;ive:</HI> They do not <HI>make them&s;elves</HI> new Creatures, it is God makes them &s;uch by his Spirit in the <HI>Day of his Power,</HI> by breathing &s;piritual Life into their Souls, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.4. Or in other Words by <HI>putting his Spirit into them,</HI> and <HI>cau&s;ing them to live,</HI> Ver. 14. Which well agrees with what God &s;ays, Ezek. 36.26, 27. <HI>A new Heart al&s;o will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the &s;tony Heart out of your Fle&s;h, and I will give you an Heart of Fle&s;h. And I will put my Spirit with|in you, and cau&s;e you to walk in my Statutes, and ye &s;hall keep my Judgments and do them.</HI> With which Words of God, tho&s;e al&s;o well agree, in Ver. 37. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them.</HI> God's thus changing Men's Hearts is &s;poken of as a <HI>Work of his mighty Power,</HI> Eph. 1.19, 20. <HI>Even the exceeding greatne&s;s of his Power to|wards them that believe, according to the working of his mighty Power, which he wrought in Chri&s;t when he rai&s;ed him from the Dead, and &s;et him at his own right Hand in the heavenly Places.</HI> Tho&s;e thus by God wro't upon and changed, are &s;aid to be <HI>created a new by him,</HI> and to be <HI>new Creatures,</HI> in Eph. 2.10. <HI>For we are his Workman|&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works, which he hath before ordained, that we &s;hould walk in them.</HI> Again, in Chap. 4.23, 24. <HI>And be renewed in the Spirit of your Mind; and put on the new Man which after God is created in Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s.</HI> Such a Work of God on his Soul, <HI>David</HI> prayed for, P&s;al. 51.10. <HI>Create in me a clean Heart, O God; and renew a right Spirit within me.</HI> All that are in Chri&s;t have &s;uch a Change in them 2 Cor.
<PB N="13" REF="006008_0010_1027154E53A94B70">
4.17. <HI>Therefore if any Man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new Crea|ture; old Things are pa&s;&s;ed away, behold all Things are be|come new.</HI> Or &s;uch a Work as this, that is intended, 2 The&s;. 1.11. called a <HI>fulfilling in Men all the good Plea|&s;ure of God's Goodne&s;s, and the Work of Faith with Power.</HI></P>
<P>Thus of the <HI>Way</HI> of God's working &s;pecial &s;aving Grace in Mens Souls, in which he in part re&s;tores tho&s;e Powers to them, which, by their Apo&s;tacy from him, they lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I will now proceed, &s;econdly, to con&s;ider the <HI>Way of God's working</HI> in the Production of <HI>common</HI> Grace, or of his Be&s;towment of it on &s;uch as are indued with it: And with Re&s;pect to this, it is no where &s;aid in Scripture, that God does it by &s;uch an Act of his Power, as that by which he gives <HI>&s;aving</HI> Grace: We are indeed in the Scriptures informed, that he does greatly enlighten, convince and reform many, whom he never &s;avingly converts, as in <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, 5, 6. And that he does be&s;tow a <HI>temporary Faith</HI> on them, <HI>Math.</HI> 13.20, 21. and <HI>Luke</HI> 8.13. compared. We are al&s;o informed how much the Lives of &s;uch as have no other than common Grace may be reformed, and yet that &s;uch may fall away and peri&s;h, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.29, &mdash;22. And &s;o al&s;o in <HI>Math.</HI> 12.43, &mdash;45. With which that al&s;o agreeth, in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.24,&mdash;26. And which contains the Sum of what is in the&s;e Texts &s;aid, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Man that is made righteous &s;o far as <HI>common</HI> Grace can effect it, may again fall away or turn from his Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and by that Means fail of &s;aving Grace, and peri&s;h for ever.</P>
<P>Now altho' that common Grace, which I have thus de&s;cribed, be wro't by the Word and Spirit of God, as really as that which is &s;aving, is, yet being a Work of a <HI>different Kind,</HI> and wro't by a <HI>different Kind of Opera|tion,</HI> from the other, it is not &s;aving Grace, nor ought to be &s;o called, in the &s;ame Sen&s;e with the other.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="006008_0011_1027155075978F08">Now I &s;uppo&s;e that the Way of God's working this common Grace is by <HI>moral Swa&s;ion</HI> only: I know not how to prove the contrary to this. But by moral Swa|&s;ion here, called by &s;ome, <HI>moral Grace,</HI> I do not under|&s;tand external Means only, but tho&s;e <HI>&s;trivings of God's Spirit</HI> al&s;o, which unregenerate Sinners may enjoy, and re&s;i&s;t and quench, and be utterly deprived of, as appears from <HI>Acts</HI> 7.51. 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 19. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 63.10. and <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure it does not appear there is any &s;uch Work of God in the conferring of this Grace on Sinners, which may be lo&s;t, as there is in the working of that which I call &s;aving. And as the Operations of God differ by which tho&s;e two Sorts of Grace are produced, &s;o the <HI>Kinds of Grace</HI> differ that are wro't by them.</P>

<P>That &s;aving Grace differs <HI>&s;pecifically</HI> from that which is <HI>common,</HI> appears, <HI>fourthly,</HI> from the <HI>Names</HI> by which it is called in the Scriptures, being &s;uch as belong to the Thing &s;o called, whether its Degrees are great or &s;mall, even to the lowe&s;t as well as the highe&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus &s;aving Grace is in Scripture called <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> in an <HI>appropriate Sen&s;e.</HI> So in Prov. 9.10. <HI>The Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wi&s;dom, and the Knowledge of the Holy is Under&s;tanding.</HI> And Prov. 2.5, 6. <HI>Then &s;halt thou under&s;tand the Fear of the Lord, and find the Know|ledge of God. For the Lord giveth Wi&s;dom, out of his Mouth coming Knowledge and Unde&s;tanding.</HI> And in Ver&s;es 10.11. <HI>When Wi&s;dom entreth into thine Heart, &amp; Know|ledge is plea&s;ant unto thy Soul, Di&s;cretion &s;hall pre&s;erve thee, Under&s;tanding &s;hall keep thee.</HI> And again, in Chap. 4.7. and Jam. 3.17. <HI>But the Wi&s;dom that is from above, is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be entreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality and with|out Hypocri&s;y.</HI> This <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> is <HI>true Grace,</HI> by which Men are <HI>made wi&s;e unto Salvation,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.15.

This Kind of Grace is called the <HI>Seed of God,</HI> 1 Joh. 3.9. <HI>Who&s;oever is born of God doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him; and he cannot Sin, becau&s;e he is born of God.</HI> This is al&s;o called <HI>God's Image,</HI> Eph. 2.10. and the <HI>divine Nature,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.4. So it is called <HI>Holine&s;s, that without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord,</HI> Heb. 12.14. It is al&s;o called the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> and <HI>of Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. 8.9. and the <HI>Spirit ab&s;olutely,</HI> in Gal. 5.17. And a <HI>new Heart</HI> and a <HI>new Spirit,</HI> Ezek. 36.26, 27. and a <HI>new Creature,</HI> Gal. 6.5. This I take al&s;o to be called the <HI>Water of Life,</HI> Joh. 4.14. <HI>But who&s;oever &s;hall drink of the Water that I &s;hall give him &s;hall never thir&s;t, but the Water I &s;hall give him, &s;hall be in him a Well of Water &s;pringing up into ever|la&s;ting Life.</HI> So al&s;o in Joh. 7.38. <HI>He that believeth in me as the Scripture hath &s;aid, out of his Belly &s;hall flow Rivers of living Waters.</HI></P>
<P>By the&s;e Texts I under&s;tand <HI>neither Je&s;us Chri&s;t him|&s;elf</HI> nor <HI>imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> but the <HI>inherent Graces of the holy Spirit.</HI> The &s;ame I take to be intended by the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> which true Believers are &s;aid to have <HI>within them,</HI> Luk. 17.21. This tho' it be often <HI>&s;mall</HI> at fir&s;t like a <HI>Grain of Mu&s;tard Seed,</HI> yet it always <HI>remains</HI> and <HI>grows,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.9. <HI>Matth.</HI> 17.20.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Names</HI> by which &s;aving Grace is called in Scripture, &s;hew it to be of a different <HI>Kind</HI> or <HI>Species</HI> from <HI>common</HI> Grace.

<P>My fifth Rea&s;on is becau&s;e the <HI>Promi&s;es of eternal Life and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> in the Scriptures made unto &s;uch as have &s;aving Grace, are made unto them <HI>without Re&s;pect to any certain and pre&s;cribed Degree of Strength &s;o or &s;o increa&s;ed &amp;c.</HI> That &s;uch as are endued with &s;aving Grace are under Promi&s;es of everla&s;ting

Mercies, I here take for granted, as being what I &s;up|po&s;e you, and others with whom I am now concerned, acknowledge. Nor can that well be called <HI>&s;aving</HI> Grace, unto which a Promi&s;e of Salvation is not made. But it does not appear that God promi&s;ing Salvation to &s;uch as are endowed with &s;aving Grace, does fix on any <HI>certain Degree</HI> of it, unto which he confines the Benefits he in|tends. No: God in his Promi&s;es &s;peaks of &s;uch gra|cious Qualifications <HI>ab&s;olutely,</HI> as Things in their Nature, &s;uch as that who&s;oever have them, have a Right by his Promi&s;es unto his everla&s;ting Mercies, yea, and are in Part po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them. Thus we are told in <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.24. <HI>He that heareth my Word and believeth on him that &s;ent me, hath everla&s;ting Life, and &s;hall not come into Condemnation; but is pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life.</HI> So in 1 Joh. 3.14. <HI>We know that we have pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life, becau&s;e we love the Brethren. He that loveth not his Brother abi|deth in Death.</HI> God does not tell us, that he that has a true Faith in Chri&s;t, or Hope or Tru&s;t, &amp;c. &s;hall have eternal Life, provided the&s;e Graces are of a <HI>&s;ufficient Strength;</HI> but a&s;&s;ures us that tho&s;e that <HI>have them,</HI> are ble&s;&s;ed, and &s;hall be eternally &s;aved. So in Joh. 6.40. <HI>And this is the Will of him that &s;ent me, that every one that &s;eeth the Son and believeth on him, may have everla&s;ting Life: and I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t Day.</HI> See al&s;o P&s;al. 2.12. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are all they that put their Tru&s;t in him.</HI> So in Jer. 17.7. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man that tru&s;teth in the Lord, and who&s;e Hope the Lord is.</HI></P>
<P>It is our <HI>having</HI> true Grace, without Regard to the <HI>Degree</HI> of it, that is the <HI>Evidence of our Right</HI> to a fu|ture State of Glory. If we have Faith &amp; Holine&s;s, with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Nature</HI> of them, <HI>true,</HI> we &s;hall be &s;aved, how <HI>low</HI> &s;oever the <HI>Degree</HI> of them be. If the <HI>Seed of God</HI> be <HI>in</HI> us, it will <HI>remain</HI> in us for ever, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 3.9. Tho' it be but <HI>like a Grain of Mu&s;tard Seed,</HI> it will grow

Tho' at pre&s;ent the good Work of God be but <HI>begun,</HI> yet it will certainly be <HI>car|ried on,</HI> by the <HI>Author and Fini&s;her of our Faith.</HI> Hence that in Phil. 1.6. <HI>Being confident of this very Thing, that he which hath begun a good Work in you, will perform it until the Day of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Such as have <HI>true Grace,</HI> are <HI>kept by the Power of God thro' Faith unto Salvation.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.5. So true is that &s;poken of our Saviour, I&s;ai. 42.3. <HI>A brui&s;ed Reed &s;hall he not break; and the &s;moaking Flax &s;hall he not quench; he &s;hall bring forth Judgment unto Truth.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="reason">
<HEAD>REASON VI.</HEAD>
<P>I argue here al&s;o, &s;ixthly, from the <HI>virtue and efficacy</HI> a&s;cribed in Scripture to <HI>&s;aving</HI> Grace, and <HI>no other,</HI> to prove that it differs in the Nature of it from <HI>common</HI> Grace. Thus we are told in 1 Joh. 3.9. that &s;uch as <HI>are born of God and have his Seed in them, cannot commit Sin:</HI> that is, they cannot Sin as unregenerate Per&s;ons do, <HI>viz.</HI> live in Sin as Per&s;ons under the Dominion of it, and <HI>&s;in unto Death.</HI> Of &s;uch we are accordingly told in Chap. 5th of the &s;ame Epi&s;tle, Ver. 4. that they <HI>all</HI> of them <HI>overcome the World</HI> by that Faith of which they are the Subjects; which cannot be a <HI>common</HI> Faith, but a <HI>&s;aving</HI> Grace of God's Spirit. The &s;ame <HI>Kind</HI> of Faith is &s;aid to <HI>purify the Heart,</HI> Act. 15.9. and to <HI>work by Love,</HI> Gal. 5.6. Of the &s;ame Kind of Faith we are al&s;o told, in 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 12.13. that it <HI>worketh effectually in them that believe;</HI> i. e. it always does &s;o. All that have Faith of this Kind may truly &s;ay, as in 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>But we all with open Face beholding as in a Gla&s;s the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame Image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Of &s;uch Per&s;ons as have this Kind of Grace, that al|ways holds true, Prov. 4.18. <HI>But the Path of the Ju&s;t is as the &s;hining Light, that &s;hineth more and move unto the perfect Day.</HI> Such may indeed fall into Sin as it were
<PB N="18" REF="006008_0015_1027155D603F5348">
by Surprize, and be overcome by very powerful Temp|tations; but if they fall, they will ri&s;e again, and will <HI>grow in Grace,</HI> and get more &s;piritual Strength. Hence that in Job 17.9. <HI>The Righteous al&s;o &s;hall hold on his Way, and he that hath clean Hands &s;hall be &s;tronger and &s;tronger.</HI> But what is here &s;aid, cannot be affirmed of Per&s;ons that have the <HI>highe&s;t Degrees</HI> of <HI>common Grace.</HI> This is evident in <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, 5, 6.</P>

<HEAD>REASON VII.</HEAD>
<P>My &s;eventh Rea&s;on for what I here maintain is, that if the contrary be &s;uppo&s;ed to be true, &s;everal <HI>great Ab|&s;urdities will follow;</HI> (1) That a Per&s;on may have a real Work of Grace wrought in his Soul, in its <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Kind &s;aving,</HI> and yet be &s;till in an <HI>unregenerate State,</HI> not <HI>born of God,</HI> becau&s;e he has not &s;o <HI>great a Degree of Grace,</HI> as is &s;uppo&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary to that End. Thus a Per&s;on that hath <HI>&s;ome</HI> Degree of true Faith &amp; Holine&s;s, mu&s;t yet be denominated an <HI>Unbeliever,</HI> and an <HI>unholy</HI> Per&s;on; and a Per&s;on that has a <HI>Love to God and Chri&s;t really true</HI> as to the Kind of it, is &s;till to be accounted an <HI>Hater of God and Chri&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e his Love is <HI>no &s;tronger:</HI> How ab&s;urd is this! (2) It followeth on the Hypothe&s;is oppo&s;ed, that a Per&s;on endowed with <HI>true Grace,</HI> and &s;o <HI>&s;anctified in Part,</HI> may yet remain <HI>unju&s;ti|fied,</HI> and <HI>under the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God.</HI> I would inquire, <HI>What would become of &s;uch a Man, &s;hould he die?</HI> Would he be <HI>deprived</HI> of his low Degree of Holine&s;s at his Death, and &s;o be &s;ent to Hell? Or might he go to Heaven, tho' <HI>not ju&s;tified</HI> in his Life? (3) It will fol|low, either that a Per&s;on <HI>not ju&s;tified</HI> may <HI>die well,</HI> and <HI>go to Heaven;</HI> or that a Per&s;on in Part <HI>&s;anctified,</HI> hav|ing &s;ome Degree of <HI>true Holine&s;s,</HI> may <HI>utterly</HI> lo&s;e or fall from it, and &s;o <HI>peri&s;h for ever.</HI> But will either of the&s;e be allowed? (4) It will follow, that no Man can be a&s;&s;ured of his Salvation from his experiencing a Work

of God on his Soul, which is in the <HI>Nature of it &s;aving;</HI> and &s;uch as Per&s;ons &s;avingly united to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, have wrought in them; becau&s;e he has not &s;uch <HI>high Degrees</HI> of Holine&s;s as are &s;uppo&s;ed to be required to prove that Per&s;ons are in a <HI>State of Grace.</HI> May a Doctrine on which &s;uch Ab&s;urdities will follow, be received as true.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="reason">
<HEAD>REASON VIII.</HEAD>
<P>I argue here eighthly for what I hold, from the great Difficulty of Chri&s;tians obtaining <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> of their good. E&s;tate, if the Difference betwixt common and &s;aving Grace were only gradual, and not &s;pecifical. That a <HI>comfortable A&s;&s;urance</HI> of our good E&s;tate is both nece&s;&s;ary and attainable, is I think generally believed among us: and the &s;ame &s;eems al&s;o evident from Scripture; as in 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.4. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.6, 7, 8. And 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12. But now, if Per&s;ons cannot be a&s;&s;ured of the Goodne&s;s and Safety of their E&s;tate, from their being endowed with Grace of any Kind what&s;o|ever, tho' as good in the Nature of it as any ever have given to them; but &s;till the Goodne&s;s of their E&s;tate depends on the Mea&s;ure and Degree of the Grace be|&s;towed on them; it &s;eems to me exceeding difficult, on this Suppo&s;ition, for a Per&s;on to obtain a well grounded A&s;&s;urance that his State is good: For tho' &s;uch a Per|&s;on finds, on Self-Examination, that he is <HI>really</HI> endowed with Faith in Chri&s;t, Love to God, Hope &amp; Confidence in his Mercy &amp;c. which are good as to the Kind of them, as <HI>any that are de&s;cribed in Scripture,</HI> and as the <HI>be&s;t Saints</HI> are the Subjects of, and does not at all call this in Que&s;tion; yet the &s;ame Man may &s;till remain in <HI>great Fears</HI> that he is not yet <HI>pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life,</HI> as in <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.24. becau&s;e he is yet under Doubts that his Graces are not yet &s;o <HI>&s;trong</HI> as they mu&s;t be in order to the Change of his State. <Q>I find, &s;ays &s;uch a Saint, that I <HI>truly believe</HI> in the Son of God, and tru&s;t in
<PB N="20" REF="006008_0017_102715660C72C868">
his Name, and <HI>repent</HI> of my many Sins again&s;t him; but I know not whether the&s;e Graces which I have in my Heart, are &s;ufficient in their <HI>Degrees</HI> to evidence my State to be &s;afe and happy; nor do I know how I &s;hall be re&s;olved in this Point.</Q></P>
<P>This now &s;eems to be a difficult Ca&s;e on the Suppo|&s;ition impleaded; and in order to a Soul's having Satis|faction with Re&s;pect to it, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary that he be certainly informed what that Degree of Grace is which is evidential of a Man's Right to the everla&s;ting Mer|cies of God, promi&s;ed in the Covenant of Grace; and by <HI>what Rules</HI> he may come to know whether he have obtained &s;uch Degrees, or not. But this &s;eems to be a Thing attended with much Perplexity; becau&s;e the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> &s;o far as I can &s;ee, <HI>&s;ay nothing about it:</HI> They indeed &s;hew that Men mu&s;t have <HI>true Grace,</HI> as Faith, Re|pentance, the Fear of God &amp;c. in order to their knowing their State to be good; but they &s;ay not a Word of any <HI>certain Degrees</HI> of Strength their Graces mu&s;t be of, before they may look upon them&s;elves as born again, and as having a &s;aving Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and as being pardon'd and ju&s;tified, &amp;c. Thus, if the Goodne&s;s of Mens States depended on the Strength of their Graces, and not on the Truth or Rectitude of them, the Children of God would be involved in very <HI>great Difficulties.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="reason">
<HEAD>REASON IX.</HEAD>
<P>My ninth Argument to prove a <HI>&s;pecifical</HI> Difference betwixt <HI>common</HI> and <HI>&s;aving</HI> Grace is, becau&s;e we can &s;hew <HI>wherein</HI> that Difference does con&s;i&s;t. It might be true, that there is &s;uch a Difference betwixt the&s;e, tho' we were <HI>not</HI> able to &s;hew wherein that Difference lies: but if this may be di&s;covered, it will be from hence evi|dent that there <HI>is</HI> indeed &s;uch a Difference, becau&s;e that which <HI>is not</HI> cannot be <HI>known.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="006008_0018_10271567A3870C08">Now becau&s;e it &s;eems very natural to a&s;k him who a&s;&s;erts &s;uch a Difference betwixt Things, <HI>wherein that Difference con&s;i&s;ts?</HI> I think it will be proper for me to attempt an <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to this Inquiry, in order to the fur|ther evidencing of what I a&s;&s;ert, tho' I acknowledge there is a con&s;iderable Difficulty in it.</P>
<P>And to this End I &s;hall (1) briefly declare <HI>wherein</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>common Grace</HI> con&s;i&s;teth. (2) <HI>Wherein</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>&s;aving Grace</HI> con&s;i&s;ts. And then (3) Endeavour to di&s;|cover <HI>wherein</HI> the <HI>critical Difference</HI> betwixt <HI>the&s;e two</HI> lieth.</P>
<P N="1">1. I conceive that common Grace con&s;i&s;teth in &s;uch Qualifications and Actions as Sinners <HI>not yet born of God</HI> or of the Spirit, may be the Subjects of, being favoured with the outward Means of Salvation, and &s;uch Aids and Influences of the Holy Spirit, as Per&s;ons yet in an unregenerate State, may have granted to them.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that by the&s;e, without what in this Di&s;|cour&s;e I intend by the &s;aving Influences of the Holy Spi|rit, there may be, a very <HI>con&s;iderable Change</HI> wrought in &s;inful Men, in which they have Favour &s;hewn them; as appears in <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, 5, 6. and in 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.20. and many other Places. Such Qualifications I call common Grace; and if Men were not made the <HI>better</HI> by them, I know not why they &s;hould be called by &s;o <HI>good a Name.</HI> Thus I comprehend in what I call common Grace, what&s;oever may be any Ways <HI>good, u&s;eful,</HI> or <HI>commenda|ble,</HI> of which &s;uch as may be in an unregenerate State may be the Subjects, by what Name &s;oever the &s;ame may be called, as <HI>Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, Love, Zeal,</HI> &amp;c. And I could ea&s;ily &s;hew, that <HI>com|mon Grace</HI> is in <HI>Scripture frequently called</HI> by <HI>&s;uch Names</HI> as the&s;e, if there were need of it; and al&s;o that many that are not &s;avingly converted, are the Subjects of &s;uch Things or Graces.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="006008_0019_1027156B9AEE3DC8">2. By &s;aving Grace I mean a <HI>&s;pecial Kind</HI> of Good|ne&s;s or Holine&s;s; &s;uch as is intended when we are told, that <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> is that <HI>without which no Per&s;on &s;hall &s;ee the Lord,</HI> Heb. 12.14. Of &s;uch Grace or Holine&s;s as this, I &s;uppo&s;e no Man can be a Subject but what is <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> and become a <HI>new Creature,</HI> or has a <HI>new Heart</HI> given to him, and a <HI>new Spirit put within him,</HI> or, in other Words, is <HI>created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works,</HI> Eph. 2.10.</P>
<P>Now Grace, under&s;tanding by it what is <HI>peculiar</HI> to &s;uch as the&s;e, is nothing el&s;e but <HI>Man's Conformity to God's Image and holy Law:</HI> And when we &s;peak of this, we may di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the <HI>Holine&s;s of Men's Hearts,</HI> and the <HI>Holine&s;s of their Actions,</HI> as our Saviour di&s;tin|gui&s;hes betwixt the Goodne&s;s of the <HI>Tree</HI> and its <HI>Fruit,</HI> Luk. 6.43.</P>
<P>And here by the Holine&s;s of a Man's <HI>Heart,</HI> I under|&s;tand <HI>that Rectitude of Soul, by which he is able or di&s;po&s;ed and inclined, to act after a gracious or holy Manner, being again endowed with the Image of God, which he lo&s;t by his Fall,</HI> according to that in Eph. 4.23, 24. And by the Holine&s;s of a Man's <HI>Life,</HI> I here intend <HI>all tho&s;e good and holy Actions which he performs, and which flow from that Principle of Grace, which in his Regeneration he is endowed with.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two are plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Scriptures, as in <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.10. and in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 11.19, 20. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 36.26, 27. Nor are there any Actions in a <HI>&s;trict Sen&s;e</HI> holy, but what flow from a <HI>Principle of Grace</HI> or Holine&s;s in the Heart. I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What the critical Difference is betwixt the two Sorts of Grace,</HI> under Con&s;ideration. And to this I &s;ay, That the Difference betwixt them does, in my Opinion, chiefly con&s;i&s;t is this, that &s;aving Grace, even the low|e&s;t Degree of it, does receive and entertain Things of
<PB N="23" REF="006008_0020_1027156E47D77628">
a &s;piritual Nature, with Approbation, Plea&s;ure and Delight, on Account of the intrin&s;ick Excellency of them; which common Grace cannot do. That by &s;aving Grace, &s;piritual Objects are thus received, I think very evident; nor is the Rea&s;on of this le&s;s plain. When a Per&s;on is endued with what is called the <HI>Seed of God,</HI> and the <HI>divine Nature,</HI> he can immediately ta&s;te and reli&s;h the Sweetne&s;s of &s;piritual Objects, and find an inward Plea&s;ure and Delight in them. Such a Soul can <HI>ta&s;te that the Lord is good and gracious,</HI> as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 34.8. and 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.3. The Hearts of the Regenerate are changed into the Likene&s;s of &s;uch Things as are &s;pi|ritually Good, and &s;o cannot but delight in them.

It is impo&s;&s;ible but that Per&s;ons in a State of Grace &s;hould thus perceive the &s;weetne&s;s of Heavenly Things, when their Hearts are become holy like the Things which they are here &s;uppo&s;ed to love and delight in. Of &s;uch therefore <HI>God is the exceeding Joy,</HI> (P&s;al. 43.4.) And unto &s;uch, <HI>Chri&s;t is precious,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.7. The Divine Nature which they have in them, cannot but acquie&s;e in Things that
<PB N="24" REF="006008_0021_1027156FDC683B68">
are Divine. And they may with <HI>Peter,</HI> truly &s;ay, <HI>Lord, thou knowe&s;t all Things; thou knowe&s;t that I love thee,</HI> Joh. 21.17.</P>
<P>But it is far otherwi&s;e with Per&s;ons in a <HI>State of Nature. The carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t God,</HI> Rom. 8.7. It is wholly oppo&s;ite to God and Goodne&s;s; and therefore until this is in Part taken away, it is impo&s;&s;ible that a Sinner &s;hould at all <HI>delight him&s;elf in the Almighty,</HI> or <HI>chu&s;e the Things that plea&s;e him.</HI> Job 27.10. He can ta&s;te no real inward Plea&s;ure in &s;piritual Things, <HI>as &s;uch.</HI> A Prin|ciple of &s;elf Love may move and excite an unregenerate Per&s;on to do <HI>many Things</HI> that are <HI>materially</HI> Good; and he may have <HI>&s;ome</HI> Joy in Things that are &s;piritual on Ac|count of &s;ome <HI>Benefit</HI> he thinks he may receive by them; (Mat. 13.20. I&s;ai. 58.2.) But he has no Delight in them <HI>as good in them&s;elves,</HI> or as Things that have the Image of God &s;tamped on them. Yea, by <HI>&s;elf-love</HI> a Per&s;on in a State of Nature may be excited to de&s;ire, and pray for, true Grace and Holine&s;s, being convinced that he mu&s;t be damned if he have them not. Deep Convic|tions of the Reality of a future State of Rewards and Puni&s;hment, may excite in carnal Hearts a De&s;ire to ob|tain the one and e&s;cape the other: A Man's crying out&mdash; <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved!</HI> is therefore no evidence that he is a new Creature. His de&s;ires of good Things are not really for the <HI>Sake of God and Goodne&s;s,</HI> but out of <HI>Love to him&s;elf only:</HI> Nor has &s;uch a Concern, the lea&s;t Spark of true Holine&s;s in it; yet it may be beneficial to the Subject of it, as it excites him to &s;eek to God for that which is indeed &s;aving Grace or true Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor is there any &s;uch Thing as a Man's being <HI>in Part,</HI> and <HI>but in Part regenerate;</HI> becau&s;e he that has the lowe&s;t Degree of true Holine&s;s, is, with no more than that, a <HI>true Saint, born of God,</HI> and one that has the <HI>Seed of God in him;</HI> and <HI>He that has began the good Work in him, will perfect it to the Day of Chri&s;t,</HI> Phil. 1.6.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="006008_0022_10271572BA246E10">If a Man may have &s;ome Degree of true Holine&s;s in him, (which is &s;piritual Life, a divine Nature, and the Image of God) and yet remain in an unregenerate State, as not having <HI>Grace enough</HI> to denominate him a Child of God, or &s;o much as a <HI>Babe in Chri&s;t;</HI> I de&s;ire to know whether he is not as yet al&s;o <HI>wholly unju&s;tified;</HI> being <HI>unregenerate?</HI> And whether he mu&s;t be <HI>damned,</HI> if he <HI>die</HI> in <HI>&s;uch a State;</HI> and &s;o <HI>go to Hell</HI> with <HI>&s;ome Degree</HI> of <HI>true Grace in his Soul?</HI> If not, whether his <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> is not al&s;o <HI>gradual,</HI> as his true Grace is? And <HI>where</HI> &s;uch an one goes when he dies, i. e. to Heaven or Hell? or to Purgatory, as Roman Catholicks teach; becau&s;e they hold our <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> to be <HI>gradual,</HI> as our <HI>Sanctification</HI> is; in which <HI>Robert Barclay,</HI> a noted Quaker, agrees with them.</P>
<P>But &s;uch an Opinion &s;eems to me very di&s;agreable to the Doctrine of Prote&s;tant and reformed Churches, who generally hold that tho' our <HI>Sanctification be gradual,</HI> yet our <HI>Ju&s;tification is perfect at once.</HI> If any think there be o|ther Things be&s;ides that which I have mentioned, where|in the Difference betwixt common and &s;aving Grace appeareth, I am content that &s;uch as plea&s;e &s;hould enu|merate them; but I think that which I have named is <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> to &s;hew their Difference: And I do not know but that &s;uch other Things as may be named, may be compri&s;ed in that which I have mentioned.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, having, according to the be&s;t of my Abilities, an&s;wered your Que&s;tion, I crave your Accep|tance of my Endeavours to &s;erve you. I hope I have &s;ufficiently proved that there is a real Difference be|twixt common and &s;aving Grace, in Re&s;pect of their Nature, and not in their Degree only. And had I not thought that this was nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood and be|lieved, I &s;hould not have been &s;o willing to pre&s;ent you

with this E&s;&s;ay of mine. I cannot but think that the Doctrine of <HI>original Sin,</HI> and that of <HI>&s;pecial Grace in the Conver&s;ion of</HI> Sinners, have much Countenance given to them by the Truth I here maintain. That great Truth maintained by our Lord, Joh. 3.6. namely &mdash; <HI>That which is born of the Fle&s;h is Fle&s;h; and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit,</HI> is, I think, hereby explained and vindicated.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is by &s;ome objected again&s;t that which I have in this Letter pleaded for; that &s;ince it cannot be true, that Mankind have by their Fail, &s;uffered any Alteration in the <HI>Nature or e&s;|&s;ential Powers of their Souls,</HI> it is not po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould have lo&s;t that Power to know, love and &s;erve God, which all allow they were in their fir&s;t Creation endowed with. But, as yet, I &s;ee no &s;uf|ficient Rea&s;on to oblige me to grant the <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> of what is here &s;uppo&s;ed to be true. For I know not why we may not conceive, as many have done, that Man's Power before his Fall, to know, love and &s;erve God, in &s;uch a Manner as has been ex|pre&s;&s;ed, was not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, of the <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of his Soul, tho' concreated with it. And &s;ince it appears plainly to have been lo&s;t by the Fall, this &s;eems to make it very evident, that it was not of it's E&s;&s;ence, but &s;omething <HI>&s;uperadded to it, as an Ornament</HI> and Priviledge of it. On this Suppo&s;ition, the <HI>Image of God</HI> in which Man was created, (<HI>Gen.</HI> 1.26, 27.) did not con&s;i&s;t <HI>wholly in his Nature, or E&s;&s;ence,</HI> but <HI>partly</HI> in <HI>&s;uperadded Powers</HI> to enable him to perform the Duties which God required of him, and which were nece&s;&s;ary unto that End. Which Powers are, I &s;uppo&s;e,
<PB N="28" REF="006008_0025_1026E11848D56210">
implied in that <HI>Integrity</HI> or <HI>Uprightne&s;s</HI> in which Man was made, <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 7. Now if this may be granted, Man may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have lo&s;t and forfeited the&s;e Powers by his Apo&s;tacy from God, and Rebellion again&s;t him. It much favours this Hopothe&s;is, that the Image of God which Man is &s;uppo&s;ed to have lo&s;t in his Fall, appears plainly to be <HI>re&s;tored in his Regeneration. Eph.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.10. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 4. 23, 24. Al&s;o in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36, 26, 27. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.13.</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o it &s;eems evident that as Man, &s;o al&s;o the <HI>Angels that &s;inned,</HI> lo&s;t by their Fall, their Power to live unto God, and &s;erve him, in &s;uch a Manner as by the Law of their Creation they were obliged to do: And yet I think they are not &s;uppo&s;ed to have lo&s;t any Thing of their <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> or any Pow|ers <HI>properly e&s;&s;ential</HI> to them; but their Holine&s;s, or the Rectitude of their Natures only, con&s;i&s;ting in tho&s;e good Qualities with which they were, in their Creation endowed. As to Men, their <HI>carnal Minds are Death,</HI> Rom 8.7. even the <HI>&s;ame threat|ned in Ca&s;e of Sin,</HI> Gen. 2.16, 17. And the fallen Angels, without lo&s;ing any Thing of their E&s;&s;ence, are <HI>no better than fallen Men.</HI></P>
