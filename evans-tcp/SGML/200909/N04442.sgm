<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Candid Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SEEING that Corrupt Principles tend to infect the Heart and Practice, it is therefore highly nece&s;&s;ary to beware of them; we read of damnable Here&s;ies, as well as damnable Practices, (2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 1.) Seeing that the main Doctrines of Religion, have, in a Mea&s;ure, the &s;ame Relation to Piety in Practice, as a Foundation to a Super|&s;tructure, it is therefore like building a Fabrick in the Air to inculcate the one without having regard to the other. It is doubtle&s;s a commanded and Important Duty to be Valiant for the Truth upon the Earth, and to contend for the Faith once deliver'd to the Saints: But how &s;hall we be able to comply with this divine Precept, unle&s;s we know the Truths we are to be Zealous for? And how can we expect to know them without the U&s;e of proper Means to that End, &s;uch as Reading, Meditation, Prayer?</P>
<P>We are commanded to <HI>hold fa&s;t the Form of &s;ound Words,</HI> 2 Tim. i. 13. The original Word <HI>Hypotopo&s;is,</HI> &s;ignifies a Scheme or Skeleton. This plainly intends not only the Re|lation and Harmony of the great Truths of Religion to and among each other, but the Nece&s;&s;ity we lie under of ad|hering to them; but how &s;hall we do this without Know|ledge? To &s;uppo&s;e that we need not know but a few Prin|ciples, and that the Knowledge of many hinders our reli|gious Progre&s;s, is to reflect upon the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s
<PB REF="005500_0003_103967D8ED740C20">
of God in revealing &s;o many in the Scriptures: And to &s;ay in other Words that the chief Part of the Scriptures is Vain, or rather Prejudicial to our Souls benefit, which is an aw|ful Po&s;ition! If the Doctrines of the Scriptures need not be known, why have they been reveal'd? Can they be of Service to us without our Knowledge of them; but po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may Object that <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;erted, he de&s;ir'd to know nothing among the <HI>Corinthians</HI> but JESUS CHRIST and him crucify'd. I an&s;wer that Place of Scripture is to be taken comparitively, <HI>viz.</HI> That he de&s;ir'd to know nothing &s;o much among them as Chri&s;t and him crucify'd, he de&s;ir'd to make Chri&s;t in his Per&s;on, Natures, Offices, Relations, and Sufferings, together with the Benefits thereby purchas'd, the principal Subject and main Scope of his mini&s;teral Labours. He de&s;ir'd to make all his Sermons on every Subject tend to promote the Knowledge of CHRIST, Love to him and Faith in him. Neither is it unu&s;ual in Scripture to take ab&s;olute Expre&s;&s;ions in a comparative Sen&s;e. Thus the Almighty &s;ayeth, That <HI>he will have Mercy and not Sacrifice, i. e.</HI> rather than Sacrifice. Now if we take the afore&s;aid Scripture in another Sen&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Paul</HI> de&s;ir'd to know nothing more than the Doctrine of CHRIST'S Crucifixion: This tends to ca&s;t contempt upon the chief Part of the Scriptures and render them vain and u&s;ele&s;s. And it is like|wi&s;e contrary to the Apo&s;tles Practice, for he preach'd and wrote by divine In&s;piration many other Truths; and &s;urely he may be rea&s;onably &s;uppos'd to know his own Intention be&s;t.</P>
<P>It is indeed our Wi&s;dom and our Duty to proportion the Degree of our Zeal, for the &s;everal Truths of Religion to their re&s;pective Weight and Place in the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem, but without Knowledge and Judgment this is Impracticable. We are enjoyn'd to continue in the Faith, grounded and

&s;ettled. <HI>Col.</HI> i. 23. But how can this be expected without the Knowledge of the Doctrines of Faith, can we continue in that which we know not? Surely Ignorance is the Cau&s;e of Un&s;teadine&s;s in the Principles of Religion; be|cau&s;e of this, &s;ome are like <HI>Children to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the Slight of Men and cunning Craftine&s;s, whereby they lie in wait to de|ceive, (Ephe&s;.</HI> iv. 14.) It is no new Thing for fal&s;e Teachers <HI>by good Words and fair Speaches to deceive the Hearts of the Simple, (Rom.</HI> xvi. 18.) The fal&s;e Apo&s;tles en&s;nar'd the <HI>Galatians</HI> by great Shews of Piety and Affection to them, as well as by unju&s;t Reflections again&s;t faithful Mini&s;ters. Gal. iv. 17. <HI>They zealou&s;ly affect you, but not well, yea they would exclude us that you might affect them.</HI></P>
<P>Surely our E&s;tabli&s;hment in the great Principles of Re|ligion, tends to the Glory of God and our own growth in Goodne&s;s. This is our Excellency, and indeed it is one great End of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try. (<HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> iv. 11,&mdash;13.) Where|as the Contrary tends to the Di&s;honour of God and our &s;elves, and much Mars our Growth in Holine&s;s: For how can a Plant thrive that is often mov'd? Is it likely that tho&s;e will glorify God by &s;uffering for Truth who know it not? Let us therefore abhor the&s;e <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Principle's, <HI>viz.</HI> That Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion, and that it is our Duty to believe implicitely or &s;imply. Surely without Know|ledge the Mind cannot be good. Acquaintance with the fir&s;t Principles of the Oracles of God enriches the Mind and is a Lamp to the Feet. The Knowledge of divine Truths in their due Series and Connection, much confirms our belief of them, and thereby inflames our Love, and Influences our Practice. To help forward that good De&s;ign I have been induc'd to offer the following Di&s;cour&s;es to publick View; and would entreat the <HI>Reader</HI> to peru&s;e the whole before he
<PB REF="005500_0005_103967D59C53BD50">
condemns a Part, that &s;o he may have an Oppertunity of judging for him&s;elf whether the Truths therein contain'd do not harmonize among them&s;elves, and tend to promote the Glory of God as well as the Creatures &s;elf Aba&s;ement and eternal Happine&s;s. And if they be found attended with the&s;e Characters, are they not worthy of Credit and Accep|tance? Surely the Doctrines of Religion &s;hould not be judged of according to the prejudices of our Education or corrupt Bya&s;&s;es of Pa&s;&s;ion, but calmly and impartially weighed in the Scales of Scripture and Rea&s;on. For Truth will not vary according to our Humour: It is therefore un|doubtedly our Intere&s;t to know it, whether we like it or not. In the mean time we &s;hould beware of re&s;ting &s;atisfy'd with the Doctrinal Knowledge of Truth, without feeling the ef|ficacious Influence thereof upon Heart and Life, <HI>for &s;uch as know their Ma&s;ters Will and do it not, mu&s;t expect to be beaten with double &s;tripes.</HI> Now that the following Sermons may be ble&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t high God, to the equal promo|ting of Truth and Holine&s;s, is the earne&s;t De&s;ire and Prayer of thy Servant for CHRIST'S Sake.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>1 Corinthians, x. 31.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Principal Thing in human Actions, that de|mands enquiry and de&s;erves Attention, is their <HI>Form,</HI> or in other Words, the <HI>Principles</HI> we act from, and <HI>Mark</HI> we aim at in them. The&s;e are the Ingredients that do chiefly con&s;titute their Goodne&s;s or Malignity; and the&s;e that God, who is a Spirit, principally regards; exter|nal Services without the Heart, will not be accepted of by God. (<HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 15.)</P>
<P>It is much to be lamented, that the generality of Mankind &s;eem to be &s;atisfied, if the &s;urface or matter of their Actions be good, without &s;earching into the Spring and Scope of them! But unle&s;s GOD be principally Eyed in what we do, however &s;pecious our Actions may be, we do but bring forth Fruit to our&s;elves, and &s;o are, with <HI>Ephraim, empty Vines.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now the great Mark at which we &s;hould a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m chiefly in all our Actions, whether Natural, Civil or Religious,</HI> is <HI>the Glory of the mo&s;t high God.</HI> And this indeed is the Point of Truth, which our Text expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erts, <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> If Gods Glory &s;hould be our main Mark, even in our na|tural
<PB N="4" REF="005500_0007_103967D24A25FA08">
Actions, &s;uch as <HI>eating and Drinking;</HI> how much more &s;o &s;hould it be of our Religious?</P>
<P>Now the Method I purpo&s;e to u&s;e in the Pro&s;ecution of this Subject, is as follows, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, <HI>what are the Kinds and Na|ture of God's Glory.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>What is &s;uppo&s;ed by, and imply'd in our aiming at God's Glory.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. I purpo&s;e to &s;hew, <HI>how we &s;hould Glorify God.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. <HI>Why we &s;hould aim at his Glory as our chief Mark in all our Actions.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>V. <HI>An&s;wer Objections to the Contrary:</HI> And <HI>then proceed to &s;ome practical Improvement of the whole</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I return to the fir&s;t propo&s;ed, which was to &s;hew, <HI>the Kinds and Nature of God's Glory.</HI> And here it may be ob&s;erv'd, that the Glory of God is twofold, viz, <HI>E&s;&s;ential</HI> and <HI>De|clarative.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>E&s;&s;ential Glory of God,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts (at lea&s;t principaly) in the infinite eminence of the Supream Being. As Ho|nour and Prai&s;e is due to any excellent Good, &s;o Glory is due to the mo&s;t eminent; now the highe&s;t or mo&s;t tran&s;cen|dent Eminence belongs to God, both on the Account of his E&s;&s;ence and Attributes, he alone is <HI>Jehovah,</HI> infinite in all po&s;&s;ible Excellency, his Perfections are underiv'd, immen&s;e invariable and eternal: Whereas the excellencies of all Crea|tures are derived, limited, dependant, variable, and therefore not worthy to be compar'd with the divine Atributes. Now the &s;uperior Eminence of the &s;upream Being, is the Founda|tion of all the divine Glory, for which he de&s;erves to be e&s;teem'd and prais'd by his Creatures, and therefore he is call'd <HI>the Fa|ther of Glory;</HI> (Ephe&s;. 1.17.) <HI>The King of Glory,</HI> (P&s;al. 24.8.) <HI>The Lord of Glory,</HI> (Act 7.2.)</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="005500_0008_103967D0A2F95E80">Some Divines are of Opinion,
<Q>that to the <HI>e&s;&s;ential Glory</HI> of God, be&s;ides the infinite Eminence already &s;poken of, two Things concur, namely a <HI>certain brightne&s;s of that Eminence, together with the Knowledge of it.</HI> To illu&s;trate the fir&s;t of the&s;e, they mention I&s;a. 35.2. <HI>The Glory of Lebanon &s;hall be given unto it, the Excellency of</HI> Carmel <HI>and</HI> Sharon, <HI>they &s;hall &s;ee the Glory of the Lord, and the Ex|cellency of our God.</HI> Hence the Son of God is &s;aid <HI>to be the Brightne&s;s of his Fathers Glory,</HI> Heb. 1.3. And hence <HI>the Glory of the Lord is &s;aid to &s;hine round about the Shep|herds, at the Time of our Lords Nativity,</HI> Luk. 2.9. And hence it is, the <HI>Almighty is &s;aid to dwell in Light, which no Man can approach unto,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.16. Which Brightne&s;s does not &s;o much dazle the Eyes of the Body, (as the Sun doth) as of the Mind; tho' according to the Ac|count we have in Scripture, of &s;ome extraordinary Ap|pearances of divine Maje&s;ty, there was &s;ometimes an outward brightne&s;s added, to be as it were a &s;ymbol or Sign of the divine Pre&s;ence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But the other Particular which concurs to the divine Glory, is the Knowledge of his Eminence; hence the Face of God is call'd <HI>the Face of his Glory, Judg.</HI> 24.25. and his Name <HI>is Glorious, Matt.</HI> 6.9. becau&s;e by the Face and Name, the Maje&s;ty and Eminence of a Thing is known; this Knowledge in the utmo&s;t Perfection belongs only to God, who on this Account is &s;aid <HI>to dwell in Light inacce&s;&s;ible, which no mortal Eye hath &s;een or can &s;ee;</HI> neverthele&s;s a more imperfect Knowledge thereof by God's Word and Works, happens to Creatures in various Degrees, 1 Cor. 13 12. <HI>Now we &s;ee thro' a Gla&s;s darkly, but then Face to Face.</HI></Q> But to proceed,</P>
<P>The <HI>declarative Glory of God con&s;i&s;ts in the Manife&s;tation of the Former,</HI> either <HI>objectively</HI> by God him&s;elf, in fur|ni&s;hing
<PB N="6" REF="005500_0009_103967CF20816D28">
us with matter for Prai&s;e, in all the Fruits of his Bounty towards us and others, and particularly by engrav|ing in legible Characters, the Foot&s;teps of his divine Per|fections, in his Word and Works, which induce intelligent Beings to Prai&s;e him; and hence the <HI>Heavens are &s;aid to de|clare God's Glory, and the Earth his handy Work.</HI> God's Glo|ry is likewi&s;e manife&s;ted by rational Creatures two Ways, namely <HI>actively</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ively. Actively</HI> when with de&s;ign, they admire, adore and extol the divine Perfections, and &s;ay with the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.33. <HI>O the Depth! of the Riches, of the Wi&s;dom and Knowledge of God, how un&s;earchable are his Judgments, and his Ways pa&s;t finding out?</HI> The <HI>un&s;earchablene&s;s</HI> of the divine <HI>Attributes</HI> de&s;erves our wonder, and their <HI>divinity</HI> our religious Reverence. God is glorify'd <HI>pa&s;&s;ivly</HI> by intelligent Beings, either with De&s;ign when they &s;uffer patiently and chearfully for Truth and Du|ty, or without De&s;ign when they &s;uffer for their Sins as Ma|lefactors, &s;urely the Glory of God's Ju&s;tice is known by the Judgment which he executeth. I proceed to the.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to &s;hew <HI>what is</HI> &s;uppos'd <HI>by and</HI> imply'd in, <HI>our aiming at God's Glory, as our highe&s;t Mark.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> that intelligent Beings acting as &s;uch, de&s;ign &s;ome End, which induces them to concert and improve &s;uch Mea&s;ures as have a direct Tendency to compa&s;s the End they propo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> this, <HI>viz.</HI> That the ends of Actions may be various, yea and lawfully &s;o, <HI>viz. Supream</HI> and <HI>Subordinate,</HI> if our highe&s;t End be right, we are &s;afe, altho' with a le&s;s degree of Love we aim at lower Ends, which are in them|&s;elves lawful; for things that are Subordinate, do not cla&s;h or oppo&s;e each other, <HI>e. g.</HI> in our natural and civil Acti|ons we may aim at our bodily Support and Comfort, if in
<PB N="7" REF="005500_0010_103967CD7340F4D8">
the mean Time we make God's Honour our principal Mark, And &s;o in our religious Actions we may, yea we ought to aim at our own Salvation as an End, if &s;o be, we in the mean Time prefer God's Honour and Glory, to all our Intere&s;ts in this and the other World, it is well.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It <HI>Suppo&s;es</HI> this, <HI>viz.</HI> that the la&s;t End can be but one, of two equal Ends or Marks, neither of them wou'd be the la&s;t, or Principal. When two Ends unequal in might and Dignity concur, the Laws of Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice re|quire a Subordination; namely that the Inferior &s;hould give place to the Superior.</P>
<P>But our aiming at God's Glory in all our Actions, as our highe&s;t Mark and End, <HI>implies</HI> the&s;e Things following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. A <HI>&s;aving experimental Knowledge of God.</HI> Untill we have an affecting Heart humbling Knowledge, of the divine Perfections by Faith, we are not di&s;pos'd to love him aright, and direct our Actions to his Honour: For as the proverb is, <HI>(ignoti nulla capido) after an unknown Thing there is no De&s;ire.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly, A <HI>&s;trong and tran&s;cendant Love to God,</HI> becau&s;e of his e&s;&s;ential Excellency and communicative Goodne&s;s; as we cannot love God &s;upreamly, except we know him, &s;o we cannot aim at his Glory as our highe&s;t End, until we love him with a Superior and tran&s;cendent re&s;pect; for our aims and de&s;ires follow our Love, and are proportion'd to the Degrees thereof.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Our aiming at God's Glory, as our highe&s;t Mark in all our Actions, <HI>implies our prefering his Honour to all our Intere&s;ts,</HI> whether on Earth or in Heaven, whether of Bo|dy or Soul. As Love to God follows naturally after the experimental Knowledge of God, (in the manner before men|tion'd) &s;o our prefering God's Honour to all our Intere&s;ts, follows naturally and nece&s;&s;arily after, and flows from that
<PB N="8" REF="005500_0011_103967CB91062F50">
Love to God, which is &s;upream and tran&s;cendent in De|gree. If we love God above our&s;elves, with all our Souls and Strength as <HI>Jehovah</HI> requires, we &s;hall be ea&s;ily induced to prefer his Glory, to all our Intere&s;ts of every Kind. And,</P>
<P N="4">4thly, It <HI>implies, our referring all we do to God, his Honour and Glory; de&s;iring more that God &s;hould be thereby glorify'd,</HI> then after any benefit accruing to our&s;elves. The,</P>
<P N="3">3d. <HI>Propos'd</HI> comes now to be con&s;idered, which was to &s;hew, <HI>how we &s;hould glorify God?</HI> Here I &s;hall mention a few out of many In&s;tances, that might be enlarged up|on. And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>We &s;hould glorify God,</HI> by <HI>profe&s;&s;ing his Truth</HI> before Men, at all Times and in all Places, whatever Contempt and Hard&s;hips we are expos'd to thereby notwith&s;tanding, if we are a&s;ham'd of CHRIST and of his <HI>Truths,</HI> in this adul|terous Generation, we may expect that he will be a&s;hamed of us, when he comes in the Glory of his Father with the holy Angels. My Dear Brethren, we &s;hould be valiant for the Truth upon the Earth, and <HI>contend earne&s;tly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints.</HI> O let us not betray the &s;acred Depo&s;itum of Truths that is in our Hands, which has been tran&s;mitted to us, thro' much Expence of the Labour and Blood of our Ance&s;tors; to adhere firmly to the dear and precious <HI>Truths</HI> of CHRIST in the Time of a Tempe&s;t, when many <HI>make Ship-wreck of the Doctrines of Faith, and a good Con&s;cience,</HI> and are like fooli&s;h Children <HI>to&s;s'd about with every wind of Doctrine, by the Craft of tho&s;e that lye in wait to deceive,</HI> is truly Noble, and reflects Glory and Ho|nour upon God and Religion.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>We &s;hould glorify God</HI> by <HI>confe&s;&s;ing our Sins</HI> agreea|ble to <HI>Jo&s;hua's</HI> Council to <HI>Achan,</HI> Jo&s;h. 7.19. by this we Acknowledge, and thereby Honour God's <HI>Ju&s;tice, Holine&s;s,

Truth, Omni&s;cience.</HI>&mdash;By this we own that God knows one &s;ecret Sins and might ju&s;tly damn us for them, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>We &s;hould glorify God,</HI> by a <HI>Strong Superlative and pa&s;&s;ionate Love to him,</HI> above all others, with devout <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> P&s;alm 73.25. <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee!</HI> And,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>We &s;hould glorify God,</HI> by a <HI>firm Faith and Hope in the Word of his Promi&s;e,</HI> with ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Abram,</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing of the mo&s;t dark and contrary A&s;pects of divine Provi|dence, Rom. 4.18.20. <HI>Who again&s;t Hope believed in Hope, &mdash;He &s;taggered not at the Promi&s;e of God thro' unbelief, but was &s;trong in Faith giving Glory to God.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="5">5thly. <HI>We &s;hould glorify God, by obedience to Gods command|ing and di&s;po&s;ing Will;</HI> to the fir&s;t <HI>actively,</HI> and to the latter <HI>pa&s;&s;ively.</HI> Now our Obedience &s;hould be <HI>humble, thankful, chearful, charitable, fruitful, heavenly;</HI> with <HI>Abram,</HI> we &s;hould ever look upon our &s;elves, <HI>to be le&s;s than the Lea&s;t of all God's Mercy's,</HI> and with <HI>Paul</HI> far <HI>le&s;s then the lea&s;t of all Saints:</HI> When God gives us the comfort of Mercies, we &s;hould give to God the Glory of them; with the Man who was healed of his Lepro&s;ie, who we are told.

<P N="4">4th. Propos'd, which was to &s;hew, <HI>why we &s;hould aim at the Glory of God as our chief Mark in all our</HI> Actions?</P>
<P>It is true eternal Salvation, or our enjoying God (which <HI>&s;uppo&s;es our Propriety in, or rightful claim to God as ours;</HI> and <HI>implies our Communion with him here imperfectly, and in the Life to come perfectly</HI>) is a great Motive of religious Obedience, the Expectation thereof &s;hould doubtle&s;s influence and ex|cite us in the Service of God.</P>
<P>And mo&s;t certainly there is a <HI>Connection between glorifi|ing and enjoying God,</HI> &s;o that he who rightly performs the former, is not like to mi&s;s the latter. P&s;a. 50 23. <HI>Who&s;e offer|eth Prai&s;e glorifieth me: And to him that ordereth his Conver|&s;ation aright, will I &s;hew the Salvation of God.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>enjoying of God</HI> may be likewi&s;e <HI>call'd an End,</HI> and that properly, (but a Subordinate one) which we may and ought to aim at in our religious Obedience. And it is doubt|le&s;s an End, the Highe&s;t in its Kind, and next, in Order, Dig|nity and Importance, to that of the Glory of God. On this Account the venerable A&s;&s;embly at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> in their <HI>larger Catechi&s;m,</HI> call it <HI>the highe&s;t End of Man;</HI> it is certainly that, which intelligent Beings &s;hould &s;eek after, next to the divine Glory. The A&s;&s;embly did not de&s;ign to put the afore|&s;aid Ends upon a Par or equal Balance, by their An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Que&s;tion in their Catechi&s;ms, in which they are
<PB N="11" REF="005500_0014_103967C6A10A5FC0">
both mention'd together; No, by no means, they intend only to repre&s;ent the Connection &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, as well as their infinite Moment and Importance, and the Or|der in which we &s;hould &s;eek after them; which is evident from their different Manner of wording them, the Order in which they place them, and the Scriptures they bring for the Confirmation of what they offer upon this Head. In the Larger Catechi&s;m the Que&s;tion is worded thus, <HI>What is the chief and highe&s;t End of Man. God's Glory</HI> they &s;ignify by their An&s;wer, <HI>is the chief End of Man;</HI> and enjoying God fully, the highe&s;t End, <HI>i. e.</HI> (as has been before ob&s;erv'd) of its kind, next to the other: Their giving the Glory of God the fir&s;t Place in their An&s;wer, &s;hews that they prefer it in point of Dignity to the other, altho' tho&s;e Ends are <HI>in&s;eparably connected together,</HI> (in the Manner before mention'd) <HI>yet</HI> they are <HI>realy</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed: It is one Thing to aim at Gods Honour, and another to aim at our own Comfort, as the a|fore&s;aid Ends are di&s;tingui&s;h'd realy; for one may aim at his own Comfort, and have no true regard to Gods Glory at all, therefore they cannot be both Supream; but one mu&s;t be Chief and the other Subordinate or refer'd to it.</P>
<P>Now that the Glory of God is the cheif End (above all others) at which we &s;hould aim in the whole Cour&s;e of all our Actions, will appear by the following Arguments, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It is but rea&s;onable that that End, for which Man and all the other Works of God were principally made, &s;hould be Mans chief End: But the End for which Man and all the other Works of God were principally made, was cer|tainly the Glory of God, as the &s;acred Scriptures expre&s;ly te&s;ti|fy. See <HI>Prov.</HI> xvi. iv. <HI>Rev.</HI> iv. xi. <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. xxxvi. Surely <HI>Jehovah</HI> is the be&s;t Judge of the End, for which he has made his Creatures, and to which he has adapted them, &s;eeing his Under&s;tanding is infinite.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="12" REF="005500_0015_103967C51CDF2CA0">2dly. That which God commands us to aim at prin|cipally, and pro&s;ecute unweariedly, is doubtle&s;s the chief End of our Actions; but that is the Glory of God, as the Words of our Text and other Places of Scripture do ma|nife&s;t. <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> See 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iv. 11. <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 26. God's Authority of commanding his Creatures, is founded upon the &s;tronge&s;t Claims of Right; namely, <HI>creating, redeeming, protecting and providing Goodne&s;s.</HI> (See <HI>P&s;.</HI> ciii. 3. <HI>P&s;.</HI> lxvi. 89. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 19, 20.) <HI>Jehovah</HI> has an ab&s;olute Controle over us, becau&s;e we are the Product of his Power, and Monuments of his Mercy; and there|fore we cannot without equal Inju&s;tice and Ingratitude, di&s;pute his commanding Authority.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. That which the Saints of the old and new Te&s;tament principally de&s;ir'd, is the la&s;t End of acting (by right) but this the Scriptures inform us, was the Glory of God, by the following In&s;tances or Examples, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> who was willing rather to be blotted out of the Book that God had written, <HI>than that I&s;rael &s;hould be de|&s;troyed.</HI> (<HI>Ex.</HI> xxxii. 12, 32.) and the Rea&s;on was becau&s;e God's Name would have been reproached among the Heathen, by their De&s;truction as he him&s;elf el&s;ewhere ob|&s;erves. How much was the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> occupied in extolling the divine Prai&s;e and Glory, and exciting others thereto? Yea &s;uch was the Flame of his Devotion, that he even &s;ummons'd the inanimate Creation to con&s;pire in celebrat|ing the divine Honour! How memorable likewi&s;e to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e are the Words of <HI>A&s;aph P&s;.</HI> lxxiii. 25. <HI>Who have I in Heaven but thee, or on Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee?</HI> In tho&s;e Words it appears that he preferred God him&s;elf, and by con&s;equence his Glory to Heaven and the Comforts of it! <HI>Nehemiah, Jeho&s;ophat,</HI> and <HI>Eli|jah</HI>

<P N="4">4thly. That which all other Ends &s;erve as Means, mu&s;t needs be the chief and la&s;t End; but this is the very Ca&s;e in re&s;pect of the Glory of God, <HI>our Election, Remi&s;&s;ion, Adoption, Redemption, Sanctification, Salvation, &amp;c. is to the Prai&s;e of God's Glory,</HI> Ephe&s;. i. 3, 4, 5,&mdash; 12.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. That which hath an after End, is not the la&s;t and chief it &s;elf, but our enjoying God hath an after End, namely, his <HI>Glory,</HI> and therefore it is not the la&s;t and chief. (See 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> i. 3. <HI>Rev.</HI> xix. 5.)</P>
<P>Seeing that the great God him&s;elf is the be&s;t of Beings, and is &s;elf exi&s;tent, it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould be his own la&s;t End, for it would be ab&s;urd for him to aim at any Thing below him&s;elf, or his own Glory as his chief End; but all Things be&s;ides him are below him, and therefore cannot be his principal Mark.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. That which is the be&s;t Good, ought to be the la&s;t and chief End of our Actions; it is contrary to Rea|&s;on to make a le&s;s Good our la&s;t End: For that would be to prefer, a le&s;s to a greater Good. Now that the Glory of God is the be&s;t Good, appears evidently from the Al|mighty's making it the chief End of all his Works. To
<PB N="14" REF="005500_0017_103967C18380F900" MS="y">
&s;ay that <HI>Jehovah</HI> did not choo&s;e the be&s;t Good for his principal End, would be to charge infinite Wi&s;dom with Folly in his Councils and Conduct, which is as ridicu|lous as it is bla&s;phemous! The divine Glory appears like|wi&s;e to be the be&s;t Good, becau&s;e of its near Relation, to the be&s;t of Beings.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. <HI>He who brings forth Fruit chiefly to him&s;elf, is an empty and baren Vine, Ho&s;.</HI> x. 1. <HI>Zec.</HI> vii. 5, 6. <HI>When ye fa&s;ted,&mdash;did ye at all fa&s;t unto me? When ye did eat and drink&mdash;did not ye eat for your &s;elves and drink for your &s;elves?</HI> Now he who in &s;erving God aims at the enjoy|ing of God, as it re&s;pects him&s;elf, above the Glory of God, he brings forth Fruit to him&s;elf, and not to God: For he aims at him&s;elf chiefly, and not at <HI>Jehovah.</HI> Neither does the different Kind of the Benefit, alter the Ca&s;e; for both temporal and eternal Benefits, as they re&s;pect us under the Notion of a la&s;t End, are of the &s;ame Kind, and do differ but in degree.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. If we ought to love God above our &s;elves, than we ought to prefer his Glory to our Happine&s;s, for Love when it is &s;upream, includes both the chief E&s;teem and Pro&s;ecution in Affection and Practice. (See <HI>Cant.</HI> v. 10. <HI>Phil.</HI> iii. 7, 8. <HI>P&s;.</HI> lxxiii. 25, 84. <HI>P&s;.</HI> ii.) But it is evident, that we ought to love God above our &s;elves, from tho&s;e Words of CHRIST, <HI>Mark,</HI> xii. 30.31. in which is explain'd, the Scope and Sub&s;tance of the fir&s;t Table of the Deca|logue, or ten Commandments; there we are enjoyn'd <HI>to love God with all our Heart, Soul and Strength, and our Neighbour as our &s;elves.</HI> Therefore the Con&s;equence is plain and certain, that we &s;hould prefer God's Glory to our Hap|pine&s;s con&s;ider'd, &s;trictly and &s;ubjectively, as a Comfort that re&s;pects us.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="15" REF="005500_0018_103967C001D953E0">9thly. To prefer our &s;elves to God, is &s;omething very like to Bla&s;phemy and Idolatry; but to make our <HI>&s;ubjective</HI> Happine&s;s our chief End, and the Glory of God but as a Mean tending to obtain it, is to prefer our &s;elves to God. As appears thus, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>God as he is the fir&s;t and be&s;t Being and Cau&s;e of all the re&s;t, merits the fir&s;t Honours of his Creatures, by a two fold irrefragable Right; not only in re&s;pect of the in|trin&s;ick Dignity or inward Worth of his ineffably glorious E&s;&s;ence, but al&s;o in re&s;pect of his almighty Efficiency, and communicative Goodne&s;s towards his Creatures, now that which we make the la&s;t and chief End of our Actions, up|on it we confer the fir&s;t Honours. Becau&s;e by this In&s;tance, we declare it to be the chief Good in our e&s;teem! Now if we make the enjoying of God, or our <HI>&s;ubjective</HI> Happi|ne&s;s, the la&s;t End of our Actions, we a&s;cribe the Honours which only and e&s;&s;entially belong to God to our &s;elves, becau&s;e we attribute them to the&s;e Things that are ours, and as they are ours; contrary to the expre&s;s Declarations of God. See <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxviii. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xlviii. 11. The Almighty a&s;|&s;ures us in the forementioned Scripture, <HI>that he will not give his Glory to another.</HI></P>
<P>What can <HI>Jehovah</HI> expect of us, but to be glorified by us which con&s;i&s;ts in an internal E&s;teem, and external Ac|knowledgment of that infinite and &s;upream Excellency, which re&s;ults from all his venerable Attributes!</P>
<P>And now what is &s;piritual Idolatry, but the inward gi|ving of this &s;upream E&s;teem, Veneration and Love, either to other Creatures or to our &s;elves? And what is Bla&s;phe|my, but the denial of &s;ome e&s;&s;ential Attribute or Perfecti|on of God? either by our Mind Speech or Practice, or an a&s;cribing to the divine Nature, &s;ome Imperfection, contra|ry to its e&s;&s;ential Perfection? Now when we make our
<PB N="16" REF="005500_0019_103967BE4EB722B8">
<HI>&s;ubjective</HI> Happine&s;s our la&s;t End, do we not give that &s;u|pream Love to our &s;elves, which is due to God only?</P>
<P>To be the chief Good is an e&s;&s;ential Attribute of God, now when we e&s;teem any Thing be&s;ides God, or his Glo|ry, to be the chief Good, and pro&s;ecute it as &s;uch, do we not implicitly deny the afore&s;aid Attribute? And when we propo&s;e the divine Glory, only as a Mean to obtain another Good which we &s;uppo&s;e to be &s;upream; do we not make it, and by con&s;equence God him&s;elf, (in our Opinion) a le&s;s Good? and &s;o a&s;cribe to him an Imper|fection, contrary to the e&s;&s;ential Perfection, and tran&s;cend|ent Eminence of his Nature.</P>
<P>Is it not a Maxim every where acknowledged, that the la&s;t End is better than all the Means, which tend to it; and that their Goodne&s;s both in re&s;pect of Kind and Degree, con&s;i&s;ts principally in a certain Relation to the End, and &s;uitablene&s;s to attain it. And therefore when we make our <HI>&s;ubjective</HI> Happine&s;s our la&s;t and chief End we judge it better than the Glory of God, and &s;o prefer it thereto, in Opinion and Practice; now if we prefer our Things, (con&s;ider'd as &s;uch) to the Things that are Gods, con&s;equently we prefer our &s;elves to God, which is a horrible Evil, contrary to the two fir&s;t Precepts of the mo|ral Law.</P>
<P N="10">10thly. If our Happine&s;s con&s;ider'd <HI>&s;trictly</HI> and <HI>&s;ub|jectively,</HI> (as a Good or Comfort re&s;pecting us) ought to be the la&s;t End of all our Actions, then nothing is &s;uperna|tural, is either requir'd or found in the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion. The Rea&s;on of the Con&s;equence is this, Nature is &s;o prone to &s;elf Intere&s;t, that it needs not a foreign Aid to excite or a&s;&s;i&s;t it in this Pur&s;uit. Surely that which is agreeable to corrupt Nature, is not above it, and does not Scripture as well as &s;ad Experience te&s;tify, that <HI>&s;elf &s;eeking</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="005500_0020_103967BC4964C130" MS="y">

<P>The De&s;ire of Happine&s;s is certainly inate in, and co-natural to all, altho' many pur&s;ue wrong Mea&s;ures to at|tain it; vainly imagining, that it is placed in the Honours, Profits or Plea&s;ures of this uncertain Life! But this Error of the Judgment may be corrected by the Light of Rea&s;on, e&s;pecially when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by external Revelation, &s;o that Men may with more Decency &s;eek their Happine&s;s, that is them&s;elves, by the external Performance of religious Duty, chiefly upon their own Account. What is nece&s;&s;ary here, but the Light and Strength of Nature, but natural Pride and &s;elf Love? According to this Scheme, where is there any &s;upream Love to the divine Maje&s;ty, where is there any Thing truly great, ingenuous, and &s;upernatural in the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion? But on the contrary to love God, with our whole Soul whom we naturally hate, and intend his Glory above our own Happine&s;s, is both again&s;t and above Nature, until it be renewed by &s;upernatural Light and Grace! Here indeed is &s;omething truly great, good, ingenuous, and &s;upernatural. For this the Infu&s;ion of a Principle of divine Life into the Souls of the Elect, is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and to this indeed it bends freely (for the mo&s;t part) of its own accord, as Streams from a living Spring. This divine Life inclines &s;uch as are Saints indeed, to live to CHRIST, and not to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Scriptures po&s;itively and frequently a&s;&s;ert that there is &s;omething &s;upernatural in Religion! (<HI>John</HI> vi. 44. <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> i. 19. ii. 10. <HI>John</HI> iii. 3.) and to deny it, is to deny the Sub|&s;tance and Soul of Piety altogether, and to leave nothing but a &s;elfi&s;h Husk, an empty Shadow, a dead Carca&s;e in the Room of it! Again, another Argument may be this, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="005500_0021_103967BAA0986BE0">
To love Plea&s;ures more than God, is certainly &s;inful, but to make our <HI>&s;ubjective</HI> Happine&s;s our la&s;t End, and not the Glory of God, is to love our Plea&s;ures more than God; and therefore it is &s;inful. (See 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 4. <HI>Mark.</HI> xii. 30, 31.) But to proceed,</P>
<P>Another Argument may be this, that which takes away the chief inward Differences, between <HI>Sincerity</HI> and <HI>Hypo|cri&s;y,</HI> is a fal&s;e Doctrine; but the making of our <HI>&s;ubjective</HI> Happine&s;s the chief End of our Actions does &s;o, as ap|pears thus. There are &s;urely &s;ome Differences between <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> and <HI>Sincerity,</HI> otherwi&s;e we would not be &s;o fre|quently exhorted in Scripture <HI>to examine and prove our&s;elves,</HI> but the&s;e Differences are principally found in the fountains of Action: For as to the external Form, who can go far|ther than a <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> now if there be no Difference in the Roots of Action, where are we? How can we know our State? are we not exhorted to impo&s;&s;ible Things? And without the Knowledge of our State towards God, how can we attain a true and rea&s;onable Peace? But the merciful Lord JESUS, has left <HI>Peace</HI> as a Legacy to his Di&s;ciples; and <HI>Marks</HI> of <HI>Sincerity,</HI> among which this is one, <HI>viz. That the Love of CHRIST con&s;trains his People.</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 14. and this Love is with the whole Heart, as was prov'd before.</P>
<P>One Argument more may be mentioned under this Head, and it is this, <HI>viz.</HI> If all Things are from God, and by God, and to God, then Man's <HI>&s;ubjective</HI> Happine&s;s is not his la&s;t End, but the Ca&s;e is really &s;o, (<HI>Rom.</HI> xi. <HI>and la&s;t ver.</HI>) The Rea&s;on of the Con&s;equence is this, our Salvation is one, among other Things, which are deriv|ed from God, and therefore by a parity of Rea&s;on &s;hould be referred to him, or which is the &s;ame to his Glory. God is the cau&s;e efficient, directing, and final of all Things, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e, which relate to Salva|tion,
<PB N="19" REF="005500_0022_103967B9019F63D8">
concerning which the Apo&s;tle di&s;cour&s;es in the afore|cited Place. If all Things are derived from God as a Cau&s;e <HI>efficient,</HI> and are di&s;pos'd by him as a Cau&s;e <HI>directing,</HI> it is but highly rea&s;onable, that they &s;hould be referr'd to him as a Cau&s;e <HI>final,</HI> namely, that they &s;hould be to him and for him, from whom they have borrow'd their original; and this is no other than a natural, rational, and nece&s;&s;ary Circula|tion. <HI>The Rivers return again to the Ocean, the&s;e Waters which they have received from it, Ecle&s;.</HI> i. 7. mo&s;t certainly to do <HI>all Things to the glory of God,</HI> is to turn Nece&s;&s;ity into Ver|tue, for that &s;hall be the <HI>final</HI> Event of all, whether we will or nill.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to add, that our Lord JESUS has taught the Doctrine, I have been labouring to e&s;tabli&s;h, by the Order of that Pattern of Prayer, which he has left for our In|&s;truction and Imitation.</P>
<P>To the Arguments that have been already offered, I &s;hall add &s;ome <HI>ab&s;urd Con&s;equences of the contrary Opinion,</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. One <HI>ab&s;urd Con&s;equence</HI> thereof is this, that it <HI>de&s;troys entirely what it pretends to e&s;tabli&s;h,</HI> namely, <HI>the Happine&s;s of Mankind;</HI> as appears thus, without a Conformity of our Wills to God, it is impo&s;&s;ible to be happy in the En|joyment of him, <HI>for two cannot walk together except they be agreed. Without Harmony, there is no Happine&s;s,</HI> now where chief Ends are different, this cannot po&s;&s;ibly be at|tained. Different chief Ends are contrary to each other, they have no Subordination, otherwi&s;e they can't be chief, and having no Subordination, they mu&s;t needs be oppo|&s;ite, and being oppo&s;ite, the whole Train of Means, or &s;ubordinate Ends, that have a Relation to them re&s;pective|ly, cannot but be contrary! And thus it is in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, according to the Opinion I oppo&s;e: For hereby God is &s;uppos'd, to aim at him&s;elf or his own Glory as his chief
<PB N="20" REF="005500_0023_103967B77B999D38">
End, and to this all his Councils and Actings have a prin|cipal Reference: On the contrary Man is &s;uppos'd to aim at him&s;elf, or or his Happine&s;s (&s;trictly and <HI>&s;ubjectively</HI> con|&s;ider'd) as his chief End, and to this all his Con&s;ultations and Actions have a principal Reference. Now here are two Beings, an uncreated and a created, &s;et in a dreadful Oppo&s;ition to each other, pur&s;uing contrary Ends, having no acknowledged Dependance upon each other!</P>
<P>For the ble&s;&s;ed God to aim at him&s;elf, or his own Glory chiefly, &s;eeing every Thing el&s;e is infinitely beneath his Digni|ty, is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. But for an inferior Animal who has borrow'd his Being, his Breath, and all his Benefits from the Almighty Power, and unexcited Goodne&s;s of God! to forget the Rock out of which he was hewn, and reject his Dependance upon, and Subordination to his great Cre|ator, good Redeemer and liberal Benefactor, in his Aims and Actings, and &s;et up for him&s;elf in Oppo&s;ition to the Supream Maje&s;ty, is as unrea&s;onable as ungrateful, as unju&s;t as cruel, a Mon&s;ter of complicated Wickedne&s;s, too big to be expre&s;s'd by a human Tongue, and not to be thought of without extream Abhorrence!</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Van Ma&s;tricht</HI> ju&s;tly de&s;cribes the Will of God thus, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That it is nothing el&s;e, but his mo&s;t wi&s;e Propen&s;ion to him&s;elf, as his highe&s;t End, and to his Creatures for him&s;elf as Means.</Q> Now the Creatures Will, according to the Opi|nion I am oppo&s;ing, is directly contrary, being propen&s;e to them&s;elves or their Happine&s;s as their chief End, and to God and his Glory only for them&s;elves as a Mean. Now ina&s;much as God is a &s;imple Being, his will is him&s;elf, and therefore the Nature or Attributes of God are contrary to &s;uch, as &s;eek and &s;erve him chiefly for their own Sakes! And how then can they behold, or enjoy him with Plea&s;ure? Nay, on the contrary it mu&s;t needs fill them with Horror,
<PB N="21" REF="005500_0024_1039640F92B4D180">
to behold all the divine Attributes contrary to them, and therefore engag'd again&s;t them to de&s;troy them! And pray how can they enjoy him, who&s;e being is &s;o oppo&s;ite to them? Does not Plea&s;ure &s;pring from the &s;uitablene&s;s be|tween the Object and Faculty, and Enjoyment nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e Harmony and Complacence? And how can this be without an Agreement between God and the Creature, in re&s;pect of their principal Aims? To &s;peak with Reve|rence, what Complacency (can it be with Rea&s;on &s;uppos'd) the Almighty &s;hould take, in a Creature who makes it&s;elf its chief <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and &s;ubjects his Glory to its Intere&s;ts, and thus gra&s;ps at his Crown and Dignity, and &s;ets up its &s;elf as his Rival and Competitor! But a</P>
<P N="2">2d. <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> which follows from the contrary Opi|nion is this, <HI>viz.</HI> that Man <HI>propo&s;es</HI> to him&s;elf, <HI>and pur&s;ues a le&s;&s;er Good, as his la&s;t End!</HI> Here I &s;peak of Happine&s;s ab&s;tractly, and for Arguments &s;ake &s;uppo&s;e it attainable, according to the contrary Notion. That the Happine&s;s of Creatures is a le&s;&s;er Good, than God's Glory is evident from God's propo&s;ing the Latter as his chief End, in all his Works; to &s;ay that he propos'd a le&s;&s;er Good, as his highe&s;t End, would reflect Di&s;honour upon his infinite and unerring Wi&s;|dom. If therefore the Gory of God be the greate&s;t Good; it is an Argument of great Folly and Weakne&s;s, to propo&s;e a le&s;s, as our la&s;t End! If it be <HI>objected,</HI> that tho' God's Glory be the greate&s;t good <HI>ab&s;olutely,</HI> yet that it is not &s;o relatively; I an&s;wer it is the greate&s;t Good even <HI>relatively</HI> for the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Becau&s;e our Happine&s;s is in&s;eperably connected with our &s;eeking it in the fir&s;t Place, and highe&s;t Degree by divine Appointment.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a great Ingredient in Happine&s;s it &s;elf. We can|not &s;ecure Happine&s;s, (&s;o far as I &s;ee) but in this Way;
<PB N="22" REF="005500_0025_103967B5B346B968">
we cannot love God as we ought, prefer him to our &s;elves, or be &s;incerely &s;ubject to his Sovereignty; and without the&s;e Things, we cannot rea&s;onably expect to come to the En|joyment of God. A</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> is this, if glorifying God or the Glory of God, be but a Mean appointed to bring Men to Happine&s;s as their la&s;t End, then when this is obtain'd perfectly, the Mean conducing to it cea&s;es of its own Accord; &s;o that at this Rate there will be no glorifying God in Heaven; but this Con&s;equence is directly contrary to the Holy Scriptures, See 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 1.10. He will come <HI>to be glorified in his Saints.</HI> And are not the Heavenly Ho&s;ts &s;aid <HI>to ca&s;t their Crowns at the Redeemers Feet?</HI> A</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> is this, that the <HI>Notion of Happine&s;s</HI> (con|&s;ider'd &s;trictly and <HI>&s;ubjectively) being the chief End of Hu|man Actions, de&s;troys Self-denyal,</HI> one of the Terms of the glorious Go&s;pel, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.24. the&s;e Words of Chri&s;t <HI>(apar|ne&s;a&s;th&ograve; eauton)</HI> deny him&s;elf, &s;ignifies a Total or univer&s;al <HI>Self-denyal. 'Thus</HI> Leigh, <HI>in his Criticks</HI> omnino neget <HI>Pror&s;us Neget</HI> &s;ays <HI>Reynolds,</HI> Abdicet &s;eip&s;um <HI>&s;ays</HI> Beza.' but the Words of Pool in his Criticks, are remarkable upon this Place, viz. <HI>'That a Man is not commanded here to deny him&s;elf &s;imply, but re&s;pectively, &s;o far as he is contrary to God.'</HI> Doc|tor <HI>Bates</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>that Self-Denial includes all that in the order of Nature belongs to us.</Q> Now our &s;ubjective Happi|ne&s;s, con&s;ider'd &s;trictly, is but &s;elf-&s;ublimated, and therefore if we do not, in our aims and actings, &s;ubordinate it to the divine Glory, we deny CHRIST and not our&s;elves.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The afore&s;aid Doctrine de&s;troy's <HI>Chri&s;tian Simplicity,</HI> as appears thus, the Nature of <HI>Simplicity</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in directing the Mind to God in a direct Line, and in excluding all evil De&s;ign; and hence it is call'd a <HI>&s;ingle Eye</HI> by our Lord, <HI>Mat.</HI> vi. 22.23. It likewi&s;e inclines to <HI>con&s;tancy</HI> and <HI>uni|formity</HI>

in the pur&s;uit of the &s;ingle Scope or &s;upream Mark it propo&s;es, (<HI>Philip.</HI> i. 20, 21. 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 12.) But on the contrary, Hypocrites have a double Heart, a &s;quint Eye, which looks contrary Ways. A</P>
<P N="6">6th. <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> is this <HI>that the Doctrine I have been oppo|&s;ing, de&s;troys the nece&s;&s;ity of that Love, which the Go&s;pel re|quires</HI> &s;o ab&s;olutely, and inculcates &s;o pungently and frequent|ly. For if we need not aim at God's Glory above our &s;elves, or our &s;ubjective Happine&s;s con&s;idered &s;trictly, then we need not love him above or equal to our &s;elves; the Rea&s;on is this, the highe&s;t Love nece&s;&s;arily includes the highe&s;t e&s;teem and Pur&s;uit, and &s;o (e contra) a &s;mall degree of Love, little E&s;teem and indifferent Pur&s;uit. And thus the very Heart of Godline&s;s is &s;truck at, by robbing it of tho&s;e two principal Ingredients, without which it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, viz. Tran&s;cendent love to God, and of its exalted view or aim; the Glory of God, (chiefly) and by &s;ub&s;tituting in the room thereof, &s;ordid &s;elfi&s;h Principles and mercenary aims: And thus Self is the Foundation and Scope of this Religion, which looks not like the &s;ublime and &s;upernatural Religion of the Holy JESUS, but is nearer akin to that of his in|veterate Enemies the Phari&s;ees, for what was their Religion, but a circle of lifele&s;s Duties and Ceremonies, perform'd from &s;elfi&s;h Principles and with &s;elfi&s;h Views? Notwith|&s;tanding of their Learning pretence to and fame for Religion, they were Strangers to the Power and Life of it, having no higher Principles than Nature poli&s;hed by Educa|tion and Art. Self was the Foundation and Scope of their Religion.</P>
<P><HI>If it be objected,</HI> That the&s;e Men aimed chiefly at their own Honour and Intere&s;t in this World only.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer,</HI> It is true &s;ome of them did &s;o, but not all: <HI>Paul</HI> before his Conver&s;ion, and the <HI>young Man</HI> in the Go&s;pel were,
<PB N="24" REF="005500_0027_103967B28A15AA40">
of another Stamp; they had a regard to their eternal Salva|tion, and were &s;erious in &s;eeking of it. And the other Phari&s;ees, who were &s;uch gro&s;s Hypocrites as to aim at the Honours and Wealth of this World, chiefly in all their Actions, whether Civil or Religious, (it &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd, that they) aim'd at them&s;elves in &s;o doing, and not at God or his Glory, and &s;o made them&s;elves their highe&s;t Mark. It is likewi&s;e highly probable, that they aim'd at Wealth and Honour under the notion of Happine&s;s, imagining that therein or thereby they &s;hould obtain Felicity: And this is no doubt the Scope of the gro&s;&s;er &s;ort of Hypocrites of every Tribe and Order at this Day! Their cry is, <HI>who &s;hall &s;hew us any good?</HI> Now if we make our &s;ubjective Happine&s;s in Heaven, our chief End, the Mark is formally the &s;ame in both, it is Self in both, it is Happine&s;s in both that is aim'd at: The Difference lyes not in the End propos'd, but in a Mi&s;take of the Judgment concerning the Means that lead to it. The Er|ror of &s;ome of the old Phari&s;ees was more gro&s;s, and this is more &s;ubtle, but it is but a chip of the &s;ame Block, there is as little Love to God, in the one as in the other.</P>
<P>And indeed the afore&s;aid Notion does well agree with the <HI>Mahometan</HI> impo&s;ture, for thro' the whole <HI>Alcoran</HI> there is a deep &s;ilence, about &s;upernatural Principles of Wor&s;hip, &s;uch as <HI>Regeneration, tran&s;cendent Love to God,</HI> as al&s;o of &s;uperna|tural Aims, <HI>at the Glory of God above all;</HI> the chief Things that I find inculcated in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> (its foperies excepted) is &s;ome main Branches of natural Religion, inforced by the Con&s;ideration of eternal Plea&s;ures, to be afterwards enjoy'd, as the Reward of good Works, and eternal Pains to be en|dured as the Puni&s;hment of bad. The chief Difference as to the Que&s;tion under debate, is only this, (&s;o far as I &s;ee) that <HI>Mahomet</HI> aim'd at <HI>&s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures,</HI> and &s;uch as hold the Opinion I am oppo&s;ing, aim at <HI>&s;piritual Enjoyments</HI> prin|cipally,
<PB N="25" REF="005500_0028_103967B1084CE0C0">
but both are of the &s;ame Mind, as to the Sub&s;tance of the matter, viz. <HI>Dependance upon Works, and aiming at them&s;elves as their highe&s;t Mark, without a &s;uperlative Regard to God's Glory.</HI> A</P>
<P N="7">7th. <HI>Ab&s;urdity is &s;elf Wor&s;hip,</HI> if we mu&s;t aim at our &s;ub|jective Happine&s;s, (or our &s;elves) as our la&s;t End, then we mu&s;t e&s;teem, love, de&s;ire after, and pur&s;ue our&s;elves above all: For what we make to be the <HI>chief End,</HI> we declare to be the <HI>chief Good,</HI> and that mu&s;t be &s;o re&s;pected. Now, is not this inward Wor&s;hip the mo&s;t noble kind of Wor&s;hip? and this we give to our &s;elves, according to the Scheme I am oppo&s;ing. We may indeed give the Cap and the Knee to our maker, but the Heart mu&s;t be given to our &s;elves. A le&s;&s;er degree of Love, for our own &s;akes, we may allow our Creator, but the highe&s;t Degree mu&s;t be given to our&s;elves for&s;ooth, and is not this wor&s;e Idolatry then the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> are guilty of in wor&s;hiping images, for this Rea&s;on, namely, the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> (for the mo&s;t Part) allow their Images but an inferior kind of Wor&s;hip, (which they call <HI>Duleia</HI>) but this is giving to our &s;elves the &s;upream (<HI>latria</HI> or) Wor&s;hip. So that according to the afore&s;aid Opinion we are to allow the great God no more Regard and Honour, than the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> do the Sign of the Cro&s;s, and their rotten rediculous Relicts; for accord|ing thereto, God is not the terminative Object, but only the medium of Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Another Ab&s;urdity</HI> which naturally flows from the afore|&s;aid Opinion is this, viz. <HI>A making that the chief End which is not the la&s;t.</HI> After enjoying God in Heaven, the Saints do prai&s;e him, and aim at his Glory, and for this End they are &s;av'd, that the Glory of God's Grace may appear therein, (<HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> i.) That which is the chief End, mu&s;t needs be the la&s;t, for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e all other Things are referr'd to it, which they cannot be except it be the la&s;t: But on
<PB N="26" REF="005500_0029_103967AF6419D240">
the Contrary, the afore&s;aid Opinion, makes that the chief which is not the la&s;t, and is therefore ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Seeing we are not our own in re&s;pect of Creation, <HI>it is God that made us and not we our &s;elves,</HI> &amp;c. We have there|fore no Right to aim at our own Happine&s;s above the Glory of that Being, who has brought us into Exi&s;tence; there|fore it is mo&s;t unju&s;t to do &s;o, neither are we our own in re|&s;pect of Pre&s;ervation, Redemption, and Covenant Dedication, therefore it is mo&s;t Ungrateful and Sacrilegious to aim at our own Happine&s;s above the divine Glory, it is God who holds our Souls in Life, therefore &s;hould we <HI>&s;ing his Honours and make his Prai&s;e glorious,</HI> P&s;alm lxvi. We are not our own for we are bought with a Price, and therefore &s;hould we glorify God in our Bodies, and in our Spirits which are Gods; we al&s;o belong to God by covenant Contract, (<HI>Ezek.</HI> xvi. 8. <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxi. 33.) and therefore cannot without Sacrilege &s;eek our|&s;elves above his Glory.</P>
<P>Fora&s;much as the ble&s;&s;ed God is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the highe&s;t, yea infinite, incomprehen&s;ible and inexpre&s;&s;ible Eminence, it is but equal and highly rea&s;onable, that to him &s;hould be a&s;cribed the highe&s;t Honours. Surely we &s;hould <HI>render to God the Things that are Gods,</HI> Matt. xxii. 21. And therefore it is mo&s;t unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable to aim at our own Happi|ne&s;s, or any Thing that is ours, above our Makers Glory: And &s;uch as do &s;o &s;hould remember God's Judgment upon <HI>Herod,</HI> becau&s;e he would not give to God the Glory of his Gifts, but burnt Sacrifice to his own Nett, and offered In|cen&s;e to his own Dregs, (<HI>Acts xji.</HI> 23.) And likewi&s;e the Cur&s;e which <HI>Jehovah</HI> denounces upon the Ble&s;&s;ings of tho&s;e Prie&s;ts, <HI>who will not lay it to Heart, to give Glory to his Name,</HI> Mal. ii. 1, 2. It is very ab&s;urd to imagine that the divine Maje&s;ty &s;hould imbrace Enemies into his Bo&s;om, and yet this will follow from the Scheme I am oppo&s;ing; for a
<PB N="27" REF="005500_0030_103967AD44304018">
Man may hate God in his Heart, and yet externally &s;ubmit to his Government, not for God's Sake but his own. Now the oppo&s;ite Notion &s;uppo&s;es that the Almighty would re|ceive &s;uch &s;elfi&s;h &s;ordid Souls, into his glorious Imbraces, than which nothing can be more fal&s;e and unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>But to draw to the Conclu&s;ion of this Di&s;cour&s;e, I wou'd beg of my Hearers to examine them&s;elves, by what has been offer'd, whether they act generally from a <HI>right principle, Love to God, and to a right End, the Glory of God. As al&s;o whether they habitually labour to glorify God in the manner before de|&s;crib'd?</HI> viz. <HI>by profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;ts Truths, confe&s;&s;ing of their Sins, and likewi&s;e by Faith, Love, Obedience, Active and Pa&s;&s;ive?</HI> If &s;o, rejoice in God your Saviour, whatever your Affliction be! What tho' you be contemn'd, traduc'd and rejected by your profe&s;&s;ed Brethren unju&s;tly; but yet with pious Pretences, as if God was thereby honoured, yet be not ca&s;t down, but con&s;ider that &s;weet Scripture, I&s;. lxvi. 5. <HI>Hear the Word of the Lord, ye that Tremble at his Word, your Brethren that hated you, that ca&s;t you out for my Names &s;ake, &s;aid, let the lord be glorified: But he &s;hall appear to your Joy and they &s;hall be a&s;hamed!</HI> But on the other Hand, &s;uch as are &s;atisfied with an outward form of Religious Du|ties, and have no Solicitude about the Principle from which, and the End to which they act, and labour not to glorify God in the Manner before expre&s;s'd in the Cour&s;e of their Lives, are certainly gracele&s;s Hypocrites, and may therefore ex|pect to be out a&s;under at la&s;t by the Sword of divine Ju&s;tice. Con&s;ider the&s;e &s;olemn Words of our Lord, Matt. v. 20. <HI>Ex|cept your Righteou&s;ne&s;s exceeds the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the</HI> Scribes &amp; Phari&s;ees, <HI>ye can by no means enter into the Kingdom of Hea|ven.</HI> And el&s;ewhere <HI>if your Eye be evil, your whole Body is full of Darkne&s;s;</HI> your religious Performances are <HI>wild Grapes,</HI>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Heart is certainly the main Spring of practical Religion; when that is &s;et right in its aims, then all the Wheels of Motion keep their proper Di&s;tances and Spheres, and an&s;wer a valuable End: But when this main Spring is wrong &s;ett, all is wrong; the Motion of the Souls Powers is irregular and vain, becau&s;e it tends to a wrong Mark.</P>
<P>It is therefore of the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity that we be careful in chu&s;ing of and fixing upon a right Mark in our Actions: And what can this be but GOD and <HI>his Glory?</HI> Let us there|fore give him our Hearts, and make his Honour the chief &s;cope of all we do: It will be but of little Service to us to clean&s;e the out&s;ide of the Cup and Platter, if the in&s;ide be neglected, and our aims be wrong.</P>
<P>Do not therefore think it &s;trange my Hearers, that I dwell &s;o long upon this Subject, for indeed it is the very turning Point and Foundation of all practical Godline&s;s. We our|&s;elves are &s;urely &s;uch as our governing aims be.</P>
<P>You may remember that in the preceeding Sermon, I ob&s;erv'd the following Point of Truth, viz. <HI>That the great Mark at which we &s;hould aim chiefly, in all our Actions, whe|ther

<Q>That it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, for whereas every rea&s;onable Agent, both propounds to him&s;elf &s;ome Rea&s;on of his Actions, and the be&s;t End he can imagine; it is impo&s;&s;ible, but that God al&s;o in creating Man &s;hould propound to him|&s;elf &s;ome End, and there being no better End than his own Glory, he could propound no other to him&s;elf: The Glory of God being the End which he propounded to him&s;elf in creating Man, it mu&s;t needs follow that that mu&s;t be the chief and greate&s;t End which any Man can propound to him&s;elf in his Actions.</Q> To confirm this

A Chri&s;tian is to perform his natural Actions to &s;piritual Purpo&s;es, and whil&s;t he is feeding his Body at his own Table, mu&s;t have an Eye at his &s;erving God, both with Soul and Body.

<P N="5">5. <HI>General Head,</HI> which was to an&s;wer Objections. <HI>Objec.</HI> 1. "<HI>That which God promi&s;es on his Part in his covenant Dealings, with Man is Man's chief Good, or which is the &s;ame, Man's chief End; but the Thing God promi&s;es is Salvation,</HI> ergo. <HI>Had God promis'd any Thing le&s;s, it would not be call'd the exceeding Riches of his Grace, and that Salvation is pro|mi&s;ed by God in his Covenant Dealings with</HI> Man; <HI>is evident from</HI> Mark xvi. 16.

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> If that which God only or chiefly promi&s;ed, in the New-Covenant was Salvation, con&s;ider'd &s;trictly and &s;ubjectively, or &s;eparated from his Glory, then the Con&s;e|quence would avail, otherwi&s;e not, but God has no where promi&s;ed, a Salvation &s;eparated from his Glory, as appears from what has been before ob&s;erved, to which I will add one Place of Scripture, <HI>P&s;.</HI> l. 15. <HI>Call upon me in the Day of Trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou &s;halt glorify me.</HI></P>
<P>Object. 2. <HI>It is our fir&s;t and mo&s;t deeply Fundamental Du|ty, to take the Lord for our God; which mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially in|cludes our taking him, (the Enjoyment of him, and not our glorifying him, or his Glory) for our &s;upream Good; which is acknowledg'd by all to be our chief End.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The Notion of enjoying God, &s;eparate from glo|rifying him, or his Glory; is an anti&s;criptural ridiculous Whim! If it be a fundamental Duty, to take the Lord for our God, then it mu&s;t be a fundamental Error (in practical Religion) to take our &s;elves for our God; by prefering what
<PB N="39" REF="005500_0042_10396799676A1A68">
re&s;pects us, to his Honour, <HI>viz.</HI> our enjoying him, to his Glory: For here God is not regarded for him&s;elf, but only as he re&s;pects us, it is true the Word GOD is mentioned, in enjoying him, but that is only a Flam, a Blind: For its &s;till in Subordination to the &s;ordid <HI>god-Self!</HI></P>
<P>Does not that Faith which is included, in taking the Lord for our God, draw us out of our&s;elves to CHRIST, and u|nite us to his Per&s;on, before it gives us Communion in his Benefits? (<HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 20. <HI>Phil.</HI> iii. 8, 9.) And does it not excite us to admire the Former more than the Latter? (<HI>Cant.</HI> v. 10.) Surely to tho&s;e that <HI>believe, CHRIST is precious!</HI> And is it not the Sign of an Harlot, to do the contrary, <HI>viz.</HI> to regard in Marriage, the Portion more than the Per&s;on?</P>
<P>Object. 3. <HI>Is prai&s;ing God for Ble&s;&s;ings, a greater Good than the Ble&s;&s;ings for which they prai&s;e him? If &s;o, the Saints have a hard Bargain, in giving a greater Good for a le&s;s, if not, than the Enjoyment of God is a greater Good, than prai&s;ing of him, and &s;o is our chief Good and la&s;t End!</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I will be bold to a&s;&s;ert, that the Saints prai&s;ing God, is (terminatively) more noble, than the Benefits they offer Prai&s;es for, con&s;idered &s;trictly; becau&s;e of its near Relation to the be&s;t of Beings; neither is the Con&s;equence rea&s;on|able, that thus the Saints would have a hard Bargain, in giving a greater Good for a le&s;s. The Force of this Con&s;e|quence, is built upon a &s;uppos'd Analogy, between civil Bargains among Men and the Saints prai&s;ing God for Benefits they receive from him, in the following Particu|lars. 1. In civil Bargains, the Commodity a Per&s;on gives in exchange, for Good he de&s;erves, he no ways owes be|fore to the Per&s;on he deals with. 2. The Good he gives is in his own Power, it is his proper Right by Inheritance or Purcha&s;e, which he can di&s;po&s;e of as he &s;ees be&s;t, to ad|vance his worldly Intere&s;t. 3. The Good exchang'd, is
<PB N="40" REF="005500_0043_10396797C4916730">
profitable to the Receiver. 4. In this kind of <HI>Truck,</HI> when there is not &s;ome Proportion in the Value of the Things exchang'd, it's &s;aid to be a hard Bargain. If the Ca&s;e was &s;o in God's Dealings with his People, there would be &s;ome Rea&s;on for the afore&s;aid Con&s;equence, otherwi&s;e none at all! Are not Mens Prai&s;es a Debt they owe to God upon many Accounts, a Debt which they cannot pay, 'til Power be given them of God, and that brought into exerci&s;e by his gracious Operations, a Power which they have no heredi|tary Right to, nor are they able to purcha&s;e it by their Do|ings; a Debt which when paid, profits not the Receiver, for our Goodne&s;s extends not to God. Tho' Prai&s;e be the Creatures Act, yet it is God who works all our Works in us! And thus the Sophi&s;m evani&s;hes.</P>
<P>Obj. 4. <HI>The End and Scope of our Faith, is our chief End, for Faith is the greate&s;t Duty, we owe to God, and the Foun|dation of all the Re&s;t, yea it is the Gift of God, and the greate&s;t Gift we can receive in this World; it hence follows, that the End of the greate&s;t Gift, and the greate&s;t Duty, is Man's chief End; but the End of Faith is Salvation</HI> 1 Pet. i. 19. <HI>Erg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> That which is the final or &s;upream Scope of Faith is our chief End, no doubt, but what is only its interme|diate or &s;ubordinate Scope, is not; neither does the Place of Scripture aduc'd prove any more!</P>
<P>Obj. 5. <HI>Man's greate&s;t Motive to Duty, is his chief End, but his greate&s;t Motive to Duty is his Salvation;</HI> Erg. <HI>the Acti|ons of a rational Creature, mu&s;t have a Motive or incitement, for whoever acts without a Motive, acts without Rea&s;on. It is the di&s;tingui&s;hing Character of a rational Creature, to propo&s;e to him&s;elf an End, and then to pur&s;ue that End in proper Me|thods; hence Logicians tell us, the End is fir&s;t in the Inten|tion, and la&s;t in the Execution; which makes it evident, that
<PB N="41" REF="005500_0044_103967962108A270">
the Motive and the End are &s;ynonimous, con&s;equently the great|e&s;t or chief Motive, is the chief End. Now that Man's great|e&s;t Motive to Duty is his Salvation, appears from the follow|ing Places of Scripture; are we commanded to be faithful to Death, what is the Motive?</HI> Why thou &s;halt receive a Crown of Life, <HI>Rev.</HI> ii. 10. <HI>are we commanded to walk uprightly, and what is the Motive? Why</HI> the Lord will give Grace and Glory; <HI>and la&s;tly are we commanded to</HI> Love the Lord our God, with all our Heart and Soul, <HI>&amp;c. And what is the Motive? Why this</HI> do, and thou &s;halt live, <HI>Luke</HI> x. 28.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The Places of Scripture brought to confirm the a|fore&s;aid <HI>Objection,</HI> do only prove, that the Expectation of obtaining Happine&s;s in the Way of Duty, is a great Encou|ragement to the Performance of it; and that it is &s;o pro|pos'd by God him&s;elf in his Word, but what is this to pur|po&s;e? The Thing to be prov'd is, that Salvation &s;trictly and &s;ubjectively con&s;idered, is the greate&s;t Motive to Duty: of this there is not a Word in the preceeding Proofs.

Again the Objector offers his Opinion as a Com|mendation of the Saints, which is not &s;o &s;en&s;ible as could have been wi&s;h'd; but Satan as an Accu&s;ation again&s;t <HI>Job!</HI> Once more the Objector offers his Opinion, with a deal of Confidence, and Airs of A&s;&s;urance; but Satan begins mo|de&s;tly, and holds it till ju&s;t the Clo&s;e of his Speech; but the Objectors and Satans Opinion are the very &s;ame in this &s;ub&s;tantial Point, namely, in excluding that tran&s;cendent Love to God for him&s;elf, and &s;upream Regard to his Glo|ry, which are e&s;&s;ential to true Godline&s;s, and con&s;tituting &s;elfi&s;h Con&s;iderations in the Room thereof. It is true the Objector has the Advantage of Satan in this particular, name|ly, in believing that the Saints had a chief Regard, to the Intere&s;ts of the higher Part of &s;elf the Soul, whereas Satan was of Opinion, that <HI>Job</HI> eyed chiefly the Intere&s;t of the lower Part of <HI>Self</HI> the Body.

<P>But even when poor <HI>Job,</HI> was under a horrible Com|plication of all manner of Mi&s;ery, that the &s;ubtilty and Malice of his formidable Enemy, could invent and inflict upon his Mind and Body; while in the mean Time, the God he loved withdrew his beamy Smiles, and on the contrary &s;hot Arrows dipt in burning Vengeance, into his perplexed Soul, and compa&s;s'd him with the mo&s;t affrighting Terrors! I &s;ay while Heaven it &s;elf frown'd, and Earth and Hell con&s;pir'd to di&s;tre&s;s and &s;hake that gallant noble Soul, yet he remain'd, like a Rock impregnable amid&s;t all the boi&s;terous Billows, with which he was environ'd round: For notwith&s;tanding &s;ome humane Weakne&s;&s;es, that drop't from his troubled Soul, in the Height of his Angui&s;h; yet he would never &s;peak di&s;honourably of his God, or reproach|fully of his Religion! He kept firm to the divine Maje&s;ty, in the mid&s;t of the terrible Tempe&s;t!

<P>Now if Gods declarative Glory be his highe&s;t End, in the Creation of all, as both Scripture and Rea&s;on demon|&s;tate, then it mu&s;t be the Creatures la&s;t End too, otherwi&s;e the&s;e Ab&s;urdities will inevitably follow, viz. 1&s;t.

It wou'd be the Creatures Duty to contradict their Creator, which is mon&s;trous Bla&s;|phemy likewi&s;e! Conformity to our Creator is equally our Honour and Duty! It is mo&s;t evident, that God requires a great Part of our Submi&s;&s;ion to his Sovereignity, and Obe|dience to his Law in this very Thing, that we harmoniou&s;ly concur with him&s;elf, in carrying on the &s;ame great de&s;ign with him, of his GLORY, in that Way which be&s;t &s;uits the order of our Being: And indeed when we do otherwi&s;e, we walk contrary to God, and may expect therefore, that, &s;o continuing, he will walk contrary to us. Had Man &s;till continued in his original Integrity, he had &s;till made it his highe&s;t de&s;ign to Glorify and Honour the Author of his Being!

And when a Sinner is truly &s;anctified, he is again re&s;tor'd to much of that primitive rectitude which was lo&s;t by Sin, (<HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> iv. 24) and con&s;equently makes that again his highe&s;t aim and de&s;ign, to which he was engag'd and inclin'd by the Law of his Creation.</P>

<P>But by this Sen&s;e of the Words, the Objector makes (in his Opinion) the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> to be a Hypocrite, and an Epi|cure; for hereby it's nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppos'd, that he had no Su|pernatural Principles of Action, &s;uch as divine Life, Love, Holine&s;s; but that on the contrary he had a &s;uperior Incli|nation to live after the Fle&s;h, but was re&s;train'd from acting

Po&s;&s;ibly the Force of his Rea&s;onings may be car|ried thus far, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Dead ri&s;e not,</HI> the <HI>E|picurian</HI> Notion would be then more tolerable: But to &s;up|po&s;e that he &s;poke ab&s;olutely here, is, in other Words, to &s;ay. that he believed there was no intrin&s;ick Excellency in Ho|line&s;s, or Comforts attending the &s;incere Pract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of it in this Life, but that it was only eligible, becau&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Advan|tages en&s;uing upon it, in a future State. And not this the Sentiment of a &s;elfi&s;h &s;ordid Soul? But the Apo&s;tle ap|pears to be a Per&s;on of a very different Character by his Wri|tings. <HI>See Rom.</HI> 6.2. <HI>How &s;hall we (i. e.</HI> how can we) <HI>who are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?</HI> Tho&s;e that are Re|generated have an inward fix'd Principle, termed in Scrip|ture, <HI>the Seed of God,</HI> which creates a habitual Aver&s;ion a|gain&s;t Sin, and propen&s;ity to Holine&s;s!</P>

only thing to determine our de&s;ire, love, and fear of God, is his Attributes, as manife&s;ted to us in Creation, Protection and Redemption; its nothing to the Purpo&s;e to tell how lovely and ex|cellent God is in him&s;elf, ab&s;olutely con&s;idered; for tho' we con|&s;ider him as cloth'd with all po&s;&s;ible Perfections, without hav|ing to do with us, it will only rai&s;e our Admiration; if we con|&s;ider him as able and willing to make us happy, this will rai&s;e De&s;ire; if we con&s;ider him as ju&s;t and powerful, and are un|der Apprehen&s;ions that he will puni&s;h us, this rai&s;es Fear; if realy puni&s;hed by him, without hopes of relea&s;e, this rai|&s;es Aver&s;ion,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>if we con&s;ider him as good and merciful, and we are realy po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it, this rai&s;es Love,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> iv. 19. We love him becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer,</HI> The fal&s;ehood of the Po&s;ition, contain'd in the a|bove Objection, will appear by the following Con&s;iderations, viz. 1&s;t, Then we owe no love to God becau&s;e of his e&s;&s;en|tial Excellency, which is ab&s;urd; for what is infinitely a|miable is a proper Object of Love, and becau&s;e it de&s;erves it, it therefore demands in Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice our &s;upream Affection. 2dly, The afore&s;aid Po&s;ition, de&s;troys entirely the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upernatural Principles of Action, infus'd by Regeneration; for if we mu&s;t love only for Benefits receiv'd, and not for the &s;ake of the Giver con&s;idered ab&s;tractly, than there is no need of any thing but Nature, to excite to this. The <HI>Pagans</HI> who had nothing but natures Light to direct them, taught and practi&s;ed this. <HI>Lycurgus</HI> the <HI>Lacedemonian</HI> Law-giver, would make no law again&s;t Ingratitude, becau&s;e as he ob&s;erv'd, <HI>It was a prodigious Impiety, not to repay a Benefit:</HI> And <HI>Seneca,</HI> in his Book <HI>de Beneficiis,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Not to return one good Office for another, is inhuman; but to return evil for Good, is diabolical,</HI> p. 104. and in p. 54. 5. 6. he &s;ays, <HI>all benefits mu&s;t be gratuitious, a Merchant,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;ells me Corn, that keeps me and my Family from &s;tarving, but he

&s;old it for his Intere&s;t, as well as I bought it for mine, and &s;o I owe him nothing for it.&mdash;This, &s;ays he, is more properly the driving of a Trade, then the cultivating of a generous Com|merce;</HI> thus far he. Now tho' I believe that we may eye our own Happine&s;s, in our religious Service, yet when we do this above the divine Glory, it comes under <HI>Seneca's</HI> la&s;h, and is &s;olidly confuted by him in the preceeding Lines.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The afore&s;aid Po&s;ition, ju&s;tifies the Devils, and damned's hating God, for they are puni&s;hed by God, with|out Hopes of relea&s;e, and therefore may have an Aver&s;ion to him, according to the preceeding Objection. And farther if we are to love him only becau&s;e of the Love he expre&s;&s;es to us, then when he puni&s;hes us, tho' mo&s;t ju&s;tly for our Offen|ces, and therewith deprives us of all hopes of Mercy, we may hate him Law-fully, (for there is no Medium between love and hatred) that is, we may hate infinite Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Excellency, which is ab&s;urd!</P>
<P N="4">4. If we are bound to love God only, becau&s;e of the Be|nefits we receive or hope for from him, then we are not bound to love him at all; for the Re&s;pect we offer to him is not for him&s;elf, but for the Benefits we receive, and thus true Love to God, which is the Fulfilment of the Law, and Scope of the Go&s;pel, is de&s;troy'd entirely by this Notion. For accord|ing to it, our Love ought to be wholly center'd upon the Benefits we receive for our own &s;ake, and &s;o upon our&s;elves: Even <HI>Seneca,</HI> the <HI>Pagan</HI> Stoick, could &s;ay, this for that, is rather a truck than a Benefit.</P>
<P N="5">5. The afore&s;aid Po&s;ition de&s;troy's the Creators Right to the Creatures Love and Obedience, when he does not per|ceive them to be profitable to him&s;elf and therefore if a Per|&s;on in de&s;pair, &s;hould hate God, even in this Life, he is ju&s;ti|fied by the afore&s;aid Po&s;ition in &s;o doing. But,</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="56" REF="005500_0059_1039677D0E4EF6C0">6. The afore&s;aid Objection is incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, for while it allows, that a view of the divine Perfections, with|out any Relation to our Benefit, may cau&s;e Admiration, this Oppo&s;es the other Part of it, for what is Admiration, but a high degree of E&s;teem, and is not this the Foundation of all rational Love?</P>
<P N="7">7. The afore&s;aid Po&s;ition contradicts the Experience of true Believers, who even in the dark Hours of De&s;&s;ertion, when they think they are for&s;aken of and hated by God, yet thro' that inward Principle of divine Life which is in|fus'd into them by Conver&s;ion; feel workings of De&s;ire in them after God, and Love to him: <HI>Jonah</HI> was an In&s;tance of this, Jon. 2.4. <HI>Then I &s;aid, I am ca&s;t off out of thy Sight, yet will I look again towards thy holy Temple.</HI> When <HI>A&s;aph</HI> fear'd that God had forgotten him, and that his Mercy was clean gone from him, yet he wou'd acknowledge his infirmity, remember God, meditate upon his Works, and talk of his wondrous Doings; and <HI>Job</HI> in his Di&s;tre&s;s profe&s;s'd, <HI>that tho' God &s;hould &s;lay him, yet he would tru&s;t in him.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. The afore&s;aid Po&s;ition de&s;troys the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of loveing our Enemies <HI>of ble&s;&s;ing them that cur&s;e us</HI> and doing good to tho&s;e <HI>that de&s;pitefully u&s;e us!</HI> For if Self-Love, be the Foundation of all the Love we owe or pay to God, then it follows unavoidably that it is more &s;o of all the Love we owe or pay to Man, than the hating tho&s;e that hate us, and cur&s;ing tho&s;e that cur&s;e us, &amp;c. is in it&s;elf Rea&s;onable; for there is no &s;elfi&s;h Motive if we con&s;ider tho&s;e Things &s;imply to ex|cite us to do otherwi&s;e. But does not this Notion expre&s;ly contradict the Go&s;pel of CHRIST as well as the true Inter|e&s;ts of Society, and ju&s;tify the dreadful <HI>Pagan</HI> Principle <HI>of hating our Enemies!</HI></P>
<P>And as for the Text cited in the Objection, it will not bear the weight that is laid upon it, for it &s;ays not, that the

Saints of old, lov'd God either <HI>only</HI> or <HI>chiefly,</HI> for his love to them, and yet this is the thing in Que&s;tion; the <HI>Tenden|cy of the afore&s;aid Objection is to &s;ap the Foundations of the whole Go&s;pel, and to put natural Religion or Dei&s;m in the Room of it.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. 12. <HI>The Difference between Hypocri&s;y and Sincerity may be known according to the Scheme of making Man's &s;ub|jective Happine&s;s his la&s;t End thus.</HI> 1. <HI>From their Works; Hypocrites do all to be &s;een of Men, and con&s;equently have nothing, but outward Performances, but the &s;incere Chri&s;tian, Glorifies God in Thought as well as in Word and Action.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This Propo&s;ition is indefinite and &s;o equivalent to a univer&s;al, it is as much as to &s;ay, every Hypocrite does as afore&s;aid. And this is not true in fact; we have no Rea|&s;on to believe that <HI>Paul</HI> before Conver&s;ion did all to be &s;een of Men! Be&s;ides if the Propo&s;ition were true, it would then follow by the Law of contraries, that every one that had, or hath good Thoughts and Re&s;olutions, which are Acts of the Mind and Will, or any De&s;ires after his own Salvation, mu&s;t be a &s;incere Chri&s;tian: By this rule, <HI>Abi|meleck</HI> the <HI>Pagan, Balam</HI> the Wizard, <HI>Saul</HI> the Tyrant, <HI>Simon</HI> the Sorceror, and <HI>Judas</HI> the Traytor are dub'd for good Men! But a 2. Sign of Sincerity that is offer'd is this,
<Q>The Hypocrite doth it to obtain a corruptible Crown, but the Sincere an incorruptible.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Both the afore&s;aid Signs are the &s;ame, for both re&s;pect the End of Action, &amp; both re&s;pect a temporal Reward; tho' there be &s;ome Difference in Specie, yet the Genus or Kind is the &s;ame: What view to Honour or worldly In|tere&s;t, had the fooli&s;h Virgins or tho&s;e gracele&s;s Jews, whom the Apo&s;tle Paul &s;peaks of (<HI>Rom.</HI> x.) <HI>who had a Zeal, but not according to Knolwedge?</HI> But pray ob&s;erve and &s;ee if the Objector, does not prove him&s;elf to be a Hy|pocrite
<PB N="58" REF="005500_0061_10396779B32ABD58">
by his own Signs! <HI>Thus;</HI> If he be a Hypocrite, who makes the Intere&s;t of the lower part of <HI>Self, the Body,</HI> in this World his chief End; will it not follow, that he is al&s;o a Hypocrite, who makes the Intere&s;ts of the higher Part of &s;elf, <HI>viz.</HI> the Soul, (without regard to God's Glory) in the next World his chief End? Are they not both built on the &s;ame <HI>Foundation of immoderate Self-Love?</HI> all the Difference between them is this, that the fir&s;t re&s;pects the lower Part of Self, and &s;o is more gro&s;s; and the Latter the higher Part of <HI>Self,</HI> and &s;o is more &s;ubtil and plau&s;ible; but is there any more Love to God for him&s;elf, in the one than in the other?</P>
<P>But I proceed to the Improvement of this Subject. And</P>
<P N="1">1. Methinks what has been &s;aid, &s;erves to inform us of the Difficulty of Religion; and of the great Danger we are in of being deceiv'd, as to our State and Condition to|wards God. <HI>Surely &s;trait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way, that leads to Life and few there be that find it, there is a Generation that are pure in their own Eyes and yet are not clean&s;ed from their Filthine&s;s!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. From what has been &s;aid we may learn, the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of the New Birth, in order to &s;erve God accept|ably here, and enjoy him hereafter! For without a Princi|ple above nature, we cannot aim at God above our &s;elves. A Fountain may &s;end out Water upon a Level with it &s;elf, but not above the Level; and thus all that is done by us, while in a State of Nature, being done chiefly upon our own Account; it is but (in &s;ome Sen&s;e) a &s;erving of our&s;elves, and therefore cannot be acceptable to God; and hence the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts <HI>that he that is in the Fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God.</HI> The Church of <HI>England</HI> in their Articles of Faith, ju&s;tly &s;ay,
<Q>That Works done before the Grace of CHRIST, are not plea&s;ing to God, but have in them the Nature of Sin.</Q> However tho' they be &s;inful in re&s;pect of their Manner of
<PB N="59" REF="005500_0062_103967781138C0A0">
Performance, yet when we conform to the Command even in Externals, the Matter thereof is good, becau&s;e command|ed; and it is in this Conformity that unconverted Sinners can only with Rea&s;on expect &s;upernatural Grace; for <HI>Jehovah will be enquir'd of by the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them.</HI> And</P>
<P N="3">3. We may therefore learn, the Nece&s;&s;ity of examining our&s;elves; whether indeed we do aim at the Glory of God, in what we do? Now we may know this by the following Marks, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. When we are content to be out&s;hin'd by o|thers in Gifts and E&s;teem if &s;o be God's Glory may be thereby advanced. (<HI>Phil.</HI> i. 15.) 2. When we habitually prefer God's Glory, to all other Things, that come at any Time in Competition with it, &s;uch as Credit, E&s;tate, Relati|ons. 3. When in the General, we can be content, that God's Will &s;hould take Place, tho' it cro&s;s ours, (<HI>Mat.</HI> xxvi. 33. <HI>John</HI> xii. 28) 4. When the Reproaches that come upon God's Name, by the Falls of Profe&s;&s;ors, &amp; declining State of Religion, di&s;tre&s;s us more for the General than all our worldly Concerns! 5. When we find at Times hard grapling, to come at this Di&s;po&s;ition, becau&s;e of the Oppo&s;ition of &s;elfi&s;h Corruptions. And can after experiencing the Work of Con|ver&s;ion feel &s;ometimes the witne&s;&s;ing of our Con&s;cience <HI>that in Simplicity and Godly Sincerriy, we have had our Conver&s;a|tion in the World.</HI> 2 Cor. i. 12. 6. When we feel the Love of CHRIST, &s;ometimes &s;weetly con&s;training us to Duty. 7 when we bewail over the Remains of Hypocri&s;y in us!</P>
<P N="4">4. If we find the afore&s;aid Characters in us there is ground of Hope and Comfort for us; and tho' we have many Weakne&s;&s;es to lament, yet we are compleat in CHRIST, and <HI>he who hath begun a good Work in us, will carry it on to the Day of the Lord</HI> JESUS. <HI>He that &s;eeth in &s;ecret, will</HI> by and by <HI>reward us openly, and make our Righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;hine as the Light, and our Judgment as the Noon Day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="005500_0063_103967764B188BB0">But alas how doleful and dangerous is the Ca&s;e of all that want the afore&s;aid Signs!

<P>In fine let us be all exhorted to aim at God's Glory and to glorify him. For this is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, to obtain true Comfort, in Life, at Death and throughout Eternity!</P>

<P N="2">2d. We have the <HI>Commendation,</HI> which repre&s;ents three Things, viz, the <HI>original, u&s;e,</HI> and <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> of the Scriptures.</P>
<P>And 1&s;t. The <HI>Original, it's given by In&s;piration (theo pucu&s;ios) i. e.</HI> by the immediate and infallible guidance of the Holy Spirit, 2. Pet. i. 20, 21. <HI>Knowing this fir&s;t, that no Prophe&s;y of Scripture is of any private Interpretation, for

<P N="2">2d.

Direction for all Goodne&s;s of every kind, that may be call'd <HI>Perfect,</HI> which has all its Parts. It is the manner of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> to u&s;e many Words in expre&s;&s;ing that which they have a mind to impre&s;s on their Readers!</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing upon this Text of Scripture, I &s;hall accord|ing to the Order of it,</P>
<P N="1">I. Labour to prove the <HI>divine Original of the holy Scrip|tures.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">II. Speak <HI>of their U&s;e.</HI> The</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. General Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, is <HI>the divine Original of the Scriptures,</HI> or to prove <HI>that they have been given forth by divine In&s;piration,</HI> and are therefore infallibly true, and of divine Authority. To this End let it be con&s;idered,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That a divine Revelation is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;eeing that na|ture teaches that there is a God, or &s;ome fir&s;t Being, from whom are all things as their fir&s;t Principle, and to whom all things tend, as their la&s;t End, and who is therefore above all. It is but rea&s;onable that this &s;upream Being, &s;hould be wor&s;hiped if he is above all, more excellent than all, and we have received our All from him, (as it is incon|te&s;tibly evident;) then the&s;e Things &s;hould be acknowledged with due Reverence, and what is this but the Wor&s;hip of God? Surely he from whom our Beings and all our Benefits do proceed, has a ju&s;t Right to our Homage and Service. And &s;eeing he has made rational Creatures, in &s;ome &s;ort, capable of it, is it not rea&s;onable to conclude, that the &s;u|pream Being, who always acts with the wi&s;e&s;t De&s;ign, does and will require that moral Service for which he has given a Capacity? the Ca&s;e mu&s;t be &s;o, otherwi&s;e the Almighty has given a Capacity to no Purpo&s;e, which is unworthy of his infinite Wi&s;dom!</P>
<P>Well, &s;eeing the Almighty does require &s;ome Wor&s;hip and Service of his rea&s;onable Creatures; may we not infer
<PB N="65" REF="005500_0068_1039676E0C20DFA8">
from his infinite Goodne&s;s, that he has given them &s;ome certain and infallible rule, to direct them therein; e&s;pecial|ly con&s;idering, that there are &s;ome things in Religion, which cannot be known by the Light of Nature, viz. all tho&s;e In|&s;titutions which Spring from the meer Will or good Plea&s;ure of God, cannot be found out by the force of human Rea&s;on|ing, without &s;ome &s;pecial Revelation from God. As <HI>Jeho|vah</HI> makes his unatainted Purity manife&s;t in moral Laws, &s;o the Glory of his Sovereignty appears in his po&s;itive Injuncti|ons, re&s;pecting which his Plea&s;ure cou'd not be known with|out &s;ome divine Revelation. And thus all that tribute of Ho|nour, which redounds to his Sovereignity thereby, would be entirely lo&s;t; from all which Con&s;iderations, the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome &s;upernatural Revelation, &s;ome divine Law to direct Mankind in the Affairs of Religion, is of the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Neither, 2dly. Is it impo&s;&s;ible that the Almighty &s;hould communicate his Mind and Will to his Creatures by imme|diate Revelation: If a Creature can impart his Mind to a|nother, much more the Creator; for &s;urely there is no excel|lency in Creatures, but what is eminently in him. If it is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the Glory and Maje&s;ty of God to <HI>be|hold and be pre&s;ent with all Things,</HI> then &s;urely it cannot be injurious to his Honour to communicate his Mind to rea&s;on|able Creatures: Nay, on the contrary, it is an Indication of his Goodne&s;s and Wi&s;dom, to favour intelligent Creatures with &s;uch intimations of his Will, as are &s;uitable to the Ca|pacity he has given them, and &s;ub&s;ervient to promote their Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Neither is it in any re&s;pect ab&s;urd or impo&s;&s;ible for the Almighty to communicate his Mind to Mankind by imme|diate Revelation. Surely he that made the Soul can find ea&s;ie acce&s;s to the Work of his own Hands, and form what Impre&s;|&s;ions on it he plea&s;es! If a finite Spirit can communicate its

Ideas to the Soul of Man, as all confe&s;s, except <HI>Sadduces,</HI> how much more can the Father of Spirits? To deny the reality of In&s;piration, is not only to reject the credibility of Scripture Hi&s;tory, but to confront the avoved Sentiments of the Pagan World, who all declar'd it to be agreeable to Rea&s;on!</P>
<P>Having premis'd the&s;e few particulars, I &s;hall proceed to mention tho&s;e Characters of Divinity which are impre&s;s'd on the Scriptures. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Methinks the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of the Scriptures, is an Ar|gument of their divine Authority: The Books of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> (next to the <HI>Decalogue</HI>) are the mo&s;t ancient Writings in the World. This <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr,</HI> who liv'd in the &s;econd Centuary, and <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> after him, make fully evident. But the Words of <HI>Tertulian,</HI> in his Apology, are very memorable!
<Q>Our Reli|gion, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> far out does all that you can boa&s;t of in that Kind; for the Books of one of our Prophets only, viz. <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> (wherein it &s;eems God hath inclos'd, as in a Trea&s;ury, all the Chri&s;tian Religion preceeding &s;o many Ages together) reach beyond the antiente&s;t you have; even all your publick Mo|numents, the Antiquity of your Originals, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of your E&s;tates, the Foundations of your Cities, all that are ad|vanced by you in all Ages of Hi&s;tory and Memory of Times.&mdash; I think I may &s;ay more, they are older than your very Gods, your Temples, Oracles, and Sacrifices! Have you not heard mention made of that great Prophet <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> he was cotem|porary with <HI>Inachus,</HI> and preceeded <HI>Danaus</HI> (the antiente&s;t of all that have a Name in your Hi&s;tories) <HI>393</HI> Years: He lived &s;ome hundred Years before the ruin of <HI>Troy;</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> the olde&s;t Writer among the <HI>Greeks;</HI> lived, as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;ayeth, <HI>250</HI> Years after the &s;ubver&s;&s;ion of that City. Every of the other Prophets, &s;ucceeded <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and yet the la&s;t of them was
<PB N="67" REF="005500_0070_1039676A76F9AF48">
of the &s;ame Age with your prime wi&s;e Men, Law-givers and Hi&s;torians! <HI>thus far he.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is certain, that neither the Writings <HI>'Homer, Tri&s;megi&s;tus, Pythagoras, Bero&s;us, Plutarch, Cicero, Seneca,</HI> or any other can vie with the Books of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> for Antiquity! Now is it not Rea&s;onable to believe, that to be the be&s;t Religion which was fir&s;t? Is not Truth always the fir&s;t born? Is it not ab|&s;urd to imagine that the mo&s;t early Notices of Religion &s;hould be counterfeit? How can it con&s;i&s;t with the divine Goodne&s;s to &s;uffer Mankind to be thus impos'd upon, un|der pretence of his Authority, in a Matter that concerns their everla&s;ting Intere&s;t, without any Thing from him, ei|ther before or &s;ince, to detect the Fraud? Certainly this is unworthy of God, and contrary to the Rea&s;on of Men; and therefore the Scriptures, being the mo&s;t Antient, mu&s;t needs proceed from the God of Truth. But</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Maje&s;tick Stile of the Holy Scriptures &s;peaks them to be of a Divine Original.</HI> The Stile of the Scripture is ve|ry different from all human Writings, in it we find a &s;tate|ly plaine&s;s, a maje&s;tick Simplicity, commanding Reverence from all intelligent Beings, who do without Prejudice at|tend thereto.

the Publicaion of Laws. In the &s;acred Scriptures, Commands are i&s;&s;u'd forth with Sovereign Maje&s;ty, and Obedience perem|torily requir'd, and no other Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign'd but the Legi&s;|lators Will. Here are Promi&s;es to the Obedient, of all needful Ble&s;&s;ings here, &amp; immortal Glory hereafter. Here are Threats denounced again&s;t the Di&s;obedient of every Order, from the Prince on the Throne to the Beggar on the Dunghil; and that of no le&s;s than eternal Mi&s;eries! Here Injunctions are introduc'd, with a <HI>thus &s;aith the Lord! He that hath Ears to hear let him hear.</HI> Where do we find any Thing like to this, in any human Writings?</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Matters therein treated of,</HI> are <HI>&s;o &s;ublime and tran&s;|cendent, that they could never be devis'd by a human Mind.</HI> Here the e&s;&s;ential and per&s;onal Glory of the great Three ONE, is repre&s;ented in a &s;urpri&s;ing Light.

This the Pagans groan'd under, but a&s;crib'd it to a Fabulous Cau&s;e! Here a <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>Cure</HI> is open'd, every Way worthy of God, and every Way &s;uited to all the Maladies under which our fallen Nature labours! namely, that the Son of God &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the human Nature under its ruinous Circum&s;tances, into an in&s;eparable Union with his Deity, and therein mediate and &s;atisfy for the Sins of Men, by his Suffering and Obedience! What finite Mind could invent a <HI>Scheme</HI> in which the Divine At|tributes &s;hine forth with &s;uch humble Beauty and harmo|nizing Glory? A <HI>Scene</HI> which gives Room for the di&s;plays of Sovereign Mercy, without infringing upon the unaliena|ble Rights of Ju&s;tice! Be&s;ides the &s;acred Scriptures give us a rational Account of the <HI>Origin</HI> and <HI>End</HI> of the World.
<PB N="70" REF="005500_0073_10396765A380FD40">
The infinite Grandeur of the Almighty is mo&s;t nobly re|pre&s;ented, in the Manner of the Worlds Formation; he did but &s;peak and behold it exi&s;ted, his &s;ingle &s;overeign Beck cau&s;ed it to &s;pring in a Moment, from the Womb of empty Nothing into Being; and how awful and affecting is the Repre&s;entation which the Divine Oracles give us of the Re|&s;urrection of the Dead and the general Judgment! And where el&s;e can we find the&s;e &s;olemn Scenes open'd, which are &s;o terrible to the impenitent, and comforting to all that truly fear God?</P>
<P N="4">4. That Holine&s;s the Scripture inculcates, is an Argu|ment of its divine Original. The divine Oracles do not on|ly recommend Holine&s;s in Speech and Practice, but in the inward Sentiments and Thoughts of the Soul; and that not only by its Precepts, which are ju&s;t and equal, but by Threatnings of the mo&s;t dreadful kind, and Promi&s;es of the mo&s;t important Good; as well as by examples of mo&s;t un|blemi&s;h'd Vertue and &s;tricte&s;t Piety. The Words of Holy Scripture are pure as Silver try'd in a Furnace and purify'd &s;even Times. The mo&s;t &s;ublime univer&s;al and perpetual Purity, is the golden Center to which all the Lines in the Circumference of Scripture bend and terminate. And it ought to be ob&s;erved, that the &s;acred Scripture urges a Ho|line&s;s, which &s;prings from the noble&s;t Principle, <HI>viz. LOVE;</HI> and aims at the highe&s;t End, <HI>viz. The Glory of God;</HI> where|as divers of the Pagans have held a multiplicity of <HI>gods</HI> which is impo&s;&s;ible in the Nature of Things, and ob&s;erv'd impure Rites in their religious Wor&s;hip, and allow'd of Revenge and Self Murder! And all their <HI>Motives</HI> to the Vertues they recommend, are of a &s;elfi&s;h Nature. But the Scripture al|lures us to the Love and Practice of Vertue and Goodne&s;s, from the &s;ublime and endearing Con&s;ideration of redeeming Love! I may add, that the Pagan Morali&s;ts, <HI>viz. Socrates,
<PB N="71" REF="005500_0074_10396763EB799BB0">
Plato, Plutarch, Seneca, Tully, Ari&s;totle,</HI> are &s;ilent about Heart Purity, &s;o far as I know, without which, a regular Life has but a Shew of Goodne&s;s. As to the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion it may be ob&s;erv'd, that is was propagated among a barborous, rude and uncultivated People, and &s;pread no farther than the Force of the Sword carried it. It is evident that <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the Author of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> did nothing to prove him&s;elf to be a Prophet: What My&s;teries did he reveal? What Prophe&s;ies did he expre&s;s? What Miracles did he perform? How many Things in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> are contradict|ory and ridiculous? Be&s;ides its Precepts indulge Mens &s;en|&s;ual Inclinations with <HI>Polygamy</HI> here, and its Promi&s;es flat|ter Men's vain Hopes with the Propo&s;al of a carnal Paradi&s;e hereafter; a Paradi&s;e more fit for Swine, than rea&s;onable and immortal Souls! Well if the Scriptures be ab&s;olutely and com|paratively Holy, and tend to make us &s;o above all other Writ|ings, is it not an Argument of their divine Original? Surely Satan, who is an impure Spirit, would not invent what is &s;o prejudicial to his Kingdom, nor the Wicked who are un|der his Influence: It can't be rea&s;onably &s;uppos'd, that they would, if they could, devi&s;e a Sy&s;tem of Doctrines and Laws which directly controls their corrupt Inclinations, and dooms them to perpetual Mi&s;ery for them! Nor can Angels or good Men be the Authors of the Scriptures, becau&s;e they would be guilty of frequent lying, in a&s;cribing to them&s;elves and their Sayings a Divinity, which the Scriptures frequently at|tribute to it&s;elf, therefore it mu&s;t derive its Original from none el&s;e but God!</P>
<P>The Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome Divine Revelation has been be|fore ob&s;erved. And indeed he that denies this, does not on|ly deny the Chri&s;tian and Jewi&s;h, but all Religion in gene|ral, for all have alledged this as their Foundation; and be|&s;ides he mu&s;t acknowledge, that the Almighty has left Man

in a wor&s;e Condition than the meane&s;t Creature, to whom he has given &s;ufficient Means, to attain the highe&s;t End of their Beings: But &s;ure this is incompatible with infinite Wi&s;|dom and Goodne&s;s! If any &s;hould &s;ay, that Rea&s;on may &s;uf|fice, I an&s;wer no! It is corrupt, and therefore cannot be the Rule of Right, without a Revelation. The ab&s;urd Opinions of many who have the Help of a Revelation, &s;hows the in|&s;ufficiency of Rea&s;on without it, to be our Guide in religi|ous Matters; but if it be granted, that there is &s;ome Reve|lation, then &s;urely it is the Chri&s;tian, for this alone bears the Character of Divinity; all the Re&s;t carry the manife&s;t To|kens of Impo&s;ture upon them, as has been before ob|&s;erv'd. But</P>
<P N="5">5. That <HI>Harmony</HI> and <HI>Agreement</HI> which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts betwen all the Parts of the &s;acred Scriptures, is another Proof of their divine Authority. This ble&s;&s;ed Book, was Sixteen Hundred Years a writing; it was written by a great num|ber of Per&s;ons of various Conditions, in different Tongues, in different Ages, in di&s;tant Places, and yet all the Parts whether Hi&s;torical, Prophetical, Perceptive, Promi&s;ory, Minatory, Typical, Doctrinal, &s;weetly harmonize and tend to the &s;ame noble End! This could never be the I&s;&s;ue of human Contrivance; it mu&s;t needs be the Re&s;ult of infinite Pre&s;cience, and divine Guidance! How often do unin&s;pir'd Men contradict them&s;elves in their Writings, and how much more would they contradict one another? If many Per&s;ons of inferior Attainments, did at various Times and Places write upon religious Subjects, con&s;idering their natural Blind|ne&s;s in &s;uch Matters, and their lyablene&s;s to blunder, even in reporting Matters of Fact; and indeed if the Penmen of the Scriptures had been left to them&s;elves, in the Compo|&s;ure, the Bible would have been but a Bundle of Confu&s;i|on and Contradiction, But</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="73" REF="005500_0076_10396760749303D0">6. Another Argument for the divine Original of the Scrip|tures, may be taken from the <HI>Penmen</HI> thereof; and here it may be a&s;&s;erted, that they were Men of &s;uch blamele&s;s Lives, that their Enemies could not fix &s;uch Charges upon them as might ju&s;tly weaken the Credit of their Writings. It is likewi&s;e evident, that they were Men of great Candor and Integrity, and that from their di&s;covering their own Faults, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Records his Backwardne&s;s to comply with the divine Call of going to <HI>Egypt,</HI> his Infidelity, his Murmurings, (<HI>Num.</HI> xi. 11, 15.) and <HI>Jeremy</HI> informs us, of his cur&s;ing <HI>the Day of his Birth, Jer.</HI> xx. <HI>David</HI> makes mention of his Crime in the Matter of <HI>Uriah, (P&s;al.</HI> li.) nay they do not only mention their own Crimes, but tho&s;e of their deare&s;t Relations; which carnal Policy would have inclin'd them to conceal; thus <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> mentions his Brother <HI>Aaron's</HI> making the <HI>Golden-Calf. (Exod.</HI> xxxii 25.) They al&s;o acquaint us, with the mean|e&s;s of their Extraction, thus <HI>Amos</HI> tells us that he was a|mong the Herd&s;men of <HI>Tekoah;</HI> the Evangeli&s;ts inform us that they were Seafaring Men, when call'd to be Di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>Neither were the Penmen of the Scriptures, de&s;igning Men, they &s;ought not their own Honour, as appears from what has been &s;aid, neither did they &s;eek their own Intere&s;t. Altho' <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had the Burden of Government, yet he did not affect the pomp of a King, neither did he advance his Family to that Wealth and Honour which was in the Power of his Hand to confer! No, the Laws he made, depriv'd his own Tribe of kingly Government, and the highe&s;t Honour of the Prie&s;thood he conferred on his Brothers Children, not his own! Its certain that In&s;tead of Honour and Profit, many of the Penmen of the Scriptures, expo&s;ed them&s;elves by their writ|ing and preaching to great Contempt and Hard&s;hips!</P>
<P>Be&s;ides many of the Penmen of the Scriptures, were of &s;uch Inferior Abilities that they were not able to form an

Impo&s;ture and palm it on the World. And &s;ome of them were Kings, and &s;o above the &s;neaking Meane&s;&s;es of Lying and Forgery! And to conclude this Argument, I may far|ther ob&s;erve that the very Writers of the Scriptures appear to be under a Subjection to the Doctrines they delivered, which argues them to be of a divine Original! But</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>exact accompli&s;hment</HI> of <HI>Prophe&s;ies,</HI> proves the Di|vinity of the Scriptures; to foretel Events that depend up|on arbitrary Cau&s;es, exceeds the reach of a human Mind, and is the Prerogative of that God only, who is <HI>panophthal|mos,</HI> all eye and has no Succe&s;&s;ion in Duration; but there are many In&s;tances of this kind in Scripture, <HI>e. g. Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> foretold the Idolatrous Apo&s;tacy of I&s;rael, (<HI>Deut.</HI> xxxi. 29. <HI>Jo&s;.</HI> xxiii 15.) which the Book of Judges &s;hews was accompli&s;hed. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> foretold the <HI>Babel|loni&s;h</HI> Captivity, with the Time of its Continuance, and the Deliverance from it by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> which accordingly came to pa&s;s, as other Parts of the Old-Te&s;tament do witne&s;s. The Pro|phecy of a Reformation by <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> and his burning the Bones of the Idolatrous Prie&s;ts at <HI>Bethel,</HI> did exactly come to pa&s;s three Hundred Years after. (1 <HI>Kings</HI> xiii. 2. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> xxiii, 15, 16.) And many Prophe&s;ies re&s;pecting the Time and Manner of our SAVIOUR'S coming, his Birth, Life, Mira|cles, and Death, are punctually fulfilled. It was near two Thou&s;and Years, before that famous Prophi&s;y, (<HI>Gen.</HI> xlix. 10.) had its Accompli&s;hment, <HI>Hircanus</HI> was the la&s;t of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> who &s;way'd the Scepter of Government over the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and this Man <HI>Herod</HI> a Stranger, an <HI>Idumean</HI> &s;lew; and &s;o cut off the Line of <HI>Judah,</HI> and u&s;urp'd the Government, as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> te&s;tifies; and then did the MESSIAS come.

A Mira|cle is an extraordinary divine Work, whereby &s;omething is produc'd contrary to the common Cour&s;e and fixed Laws of Nature! Now that many &s;uch have been wrought by the Prophets, by CHRIST, and the Apo&s;tles, for the Confirma|tion of the Divinity of their Mi&s;&s;ion and Doctrine, we have all the Evidence that &s;uch pa&s;t Facts will admit of, and more cannot be rea&s;onably de&s;ir'd. <HI>Elijah</HI> expre&s;ly appeal'd to God for the Determination of the Controver&s;y be|tween him and the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Baal,</HI> by a miraculous Work, and our Lord appeal'd to the Miraculous Works

They were wrought frequently in open Day, and of this the Relators were Eye and Ear Witne&s;&s;es. A Miracle is certainly the broad Seal of Heaven, which could never be given to a forgery! And therefore, as Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> ob&s;erves,
<Q>When any Doctrine which is in it&s;elf &s;uch as becometh Holi|ne&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is confirm'd by a Miracle, there can no greater A&s;&s;urance be given even by God him&s;elf of its veracity!</Q> Could the infernal Spirits imitate the miracu|lous Works which our Saviour wrought? Is it not utterly in|con&s;i&s;tent with the divine Goodne&s;s to &s;uffer them to u&s;e the Seal of Heaven in &s;educing Mankind, without giving &s;ome evident Notices of the Impo&s;ture, but this has never been done in this Ca&s;e: The <HI>Turks</HI> do acknowledge the Miracles of our Lord, and the <HI>Jews</HI> al&s;o; but the latter a&s;cribe them, thro' Malice, to the Power of Magick! But then, as our Saviour ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <HI>Satan would be divided again&s;t Satan, and &s;o his Kingdom could not &s;tand!</HI> Satan would do that which is contrary to his Intere&s;t, which is ab&s;urd! <HI>Irenius,</HI> who lived in the &s;econd Century, affirmeth, <Q>That the the Dead were rai&s;ed to Life, and other Miracles wrought in his time, by laying on of Hands.</Q> And <HI>Tertulian,</HI> in his Apology, hath the&s;e Words, <Q>Let any one be brought be|fore your Tribunal who is apparently po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Devil, that Spirit being commanded by any Chri&s;tian, &s;hall confe&s;s him&s;elf to be a Devil.</Q> But to proceed,</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="005500_0080_103967599AFFAAB8">Another Argument of the Divinity of the Scriptures, is their <HI>almo&s;t miraculous Pre&s;ervation</HI> for &s;o long a tract of Time, notwith&s;tanding the rage of numerous, powerful and politick Oppo&s;ers, while many other e&s;teemed Compo&s;ures, which never met with &s;uch Oppo&s;ition, have long &s;ince peri&s;hed. <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes,</HI> in the Days of the <HI>Mac|cabes,</HI> made diligent &s;earch for the Book of the Law, and where ever he found it, burnt it, and threatned tho&s;e that conceal'd it with Death and Torture. And about the Year of CHRIST 300, the Emperor <HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI> being determined to root Chri&s;tianity out of the World, us'd the &s;ame Barba|rities to de&s;troy the Scriptures. But the gracious God has pre&s;erv'd them to this Day, maugre the combin'd rage of Hell, and Earth! yea to pre&s;erve them whole and entire, &s;o that tho&s;e to whom they were committed, have not been &s;uffered to corrupt them, altho' they fell into Opinions in|con&s;i&s;tent with them, they have therefore fled to <HI>unwritten Traditions</HI> as the <HI>Patron</HI> of their erronious Opinions. The Jews to their <HI>Talmud</HI> and <HI>Cabala,</HI> which, they &s;ay, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> delivered by Word of Mouth. And the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> to <HI>oral Traditions,</HI> which they &s;ay were delivered by St. <HI>Peter.</HI> But I proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>That the <HI>early Succe&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> notwith&s;tanding of all the Oppo&s;ition and Contempt which was made again&s;t it, and ca&s;t upon it, gives aditional Force to what has been before offer'd. What le&s;s then Omnipotence cou'd make &s;uch &s;elf denying Doctrines, preach'd by illiterate Men, be|come victorious over the Pride and Prejudice of multitudes of divers Nations, and that without the Arts of Per&s;ua&s;ion or Influence of civil Power?</P>
<P>And indeed that divine <HI>Energy</HI> that does frequently <HI>attend</HI> the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> is a pregnant Argument of their divine Authority. By the&s;e the Minds of Men are enlightned, their Con&s;ciences alarm'd, their Hearts comforted and renew'd,
<PB N="78" REF="005500_0081_10396757F5E9AE78">
having their general Bya&s;s turn'd towards God, and Heavenly Objects, and their Lives reform'd! The&s;e Effects which have appear'd in Millions of Men, do &s;urpa&s;s the Force of Na|ture, and mu&s;t therefore be a&s;crib'd to an omnipotent Cau&s;e. And is it con&s;i&s;tent with the Wi&s;dom and Holine&s;s of God to u&s;e a forgery to produce &s;uch noble Effects, and thereby to confirm an impo&s;ture? no &s;urely! mo&s;t certainly the Almighty u&s;es In&s;truments adapted to the Effects pro|duced. <HI>Tuly</HI> ju&s;tly complains, <Q><HI>That the</HI> Pagan Mora|li&s;ts, wanted Authority to enforce their Sentiments and Pre|cepts, and that they were rather for O&s;tentation then Practice.</Q></P>
<P>And indeed the general Tendency and Scope of the &s;a|cred Scripture, being to <HI>exalt God</HI> and <HI>aba&s;e the Creature,</HI> is no incon&s;iderable Argument of its divine Original. Had Men been the Contrivers, they would have fram'd a Scheme more agreeable to their corrupt Inclinations! They would have repre&s;ented it as an ea&s;y Matter to be &s;aved, and that the Creature is not &s;o beholden to the Almighty for his Hap|pine&s;s as the Scriptures &s;ignify.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e the con&s;tant <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> both of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian Church,</HI> to the Truth of the Scriptures, &s;erves to con|firm and illu&s;trate our pre&s;ent Argument. Here let it be con&s;i|dered, that the Truth of Chri&s;tianity depends much upon certain Facts, &s;uch as the Miracles which CHRIST wrought, and his Re&s;urrection from the Dead. The&s;e the Apo&s;tles were eye Witne&s;&s;es of, and had there been any fallacy in them, could have ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd it; for the Connexion we ob|&s;erve in their Writings, proves that they had the regular ex|erci&s;e of their Rea&s;on. Now how can it be &s;uppos'd, that Men in their Sen&s;es would con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ert what they knew to be fal&s;e, and that in the face of Danger, when they had no Pro&s;pect of Honour or Intere&s;t by &s;o doing? But on the Contrary, of Reproach, Poverty and Pain, and at la&s;t Seal

it with their Blood! To which let me add, the con&s;tant Te&s;timony of Millions of Men ever &s;ince, many of whom &s;uffer'd great Hard&s;hips, yea and Death it&s;elf, rather than they would deny the Truth of the Scriptures!</P>
<P>Be&s;ides &s;ome learned Men ob&s;erve, That divers Matters of Fact recorded in Scripture, are al&s;o acknowledged by Hea|then Hi&s;torians, e. g. <Q>The Creation of the World, by <HI>Ovid</HI> in his Metamorpho&s;is. The long Lives of the Patriarchs, by <HI>Manetho.</HI> The Flood, by <HI>Bero&s;us.</HI> Noah, by <HI>Herodo|tus,</HI> under the Name of <HI>Janus.</HI> The De&s;truction of <HI>Sodom,</HI> by <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tin.</HI> Circumci&s;ion, by <HI>Herodotus, Strabo, Diodorus, Siculus,</HI> and <HI>Tacitus.</HI> I&s;raels departure out of Egypt, by the antient Record of the <HI>Egyptians, Phenicians, Caldeans,</HI> and <HI>Grecians.</HI> Mention is made of <HI>Solomon,</HI> by <HI>Dioni&s;ius Ca&s;ius.</HI> Of the Slaughter of <HI>Senacherib,</HI> by <HI>Herodotus.</HI> The famous Roman Hi&s;torian <HI>Tacitus,</HI> in his Annals, &s;peaking of <HI>Nero's</HI> Per&s;ecuting the Chri&s;tians, un|der pretence of their burning the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;ays ex|pre&s;ly, <HI>That the Author of that Name or Sect, was CHRIST, who when</HI> Tiberius <HI>was Emperor, was put to Death by</HI> Pontius Pilate, <HI>the then Procurator of Judea.</HI> The Appearance of the Star is mention'd by <HI>Calcidius.

And <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> in his Hi&s;tory, gives Te&s;timony to the Miracles of our Sa|viour.</P>
<P>Once more, if the Scriptures were not of divine Autho|rity, wherefore do wicked Men rage &s;o much again&s;t them? and why are we a&s;&s;ayled with &s;o many Temptations from Satan to doubt and object when we apply our&s;elves to the &s;erious Study of them? Would Satan &s;o much oppo&s;e them

above all other Books, did they not come from God and tend to de&s;troy his Kingdom? No &s;urely!</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding of all that hath been &s;aid in order to give us full Satisfaction, there is a nece&s;&s;ity of the internal Te&s;timony of the holy Spirit, whereby Per&s;ons are made to feel the Power of the Scriptures, forming holy Di&s;po&s;itions and &s;weet Sen&s;ations in them, an&s;werable thereunto, and thereby enabling them to believe its divine Authority, and hence it is &s;aid, <HI>that tho&s;e who believe have the Witne&s;s in them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>But I proceed to &s;peak, and that but briefly, of the 2d. General Head, which was to di&s;cour&s;e upon <HI>the U&s;e of the Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>And here I may &s;ummarily ob&s;erve, that the &s;acred Scrip|tures are the perfect and only Rule of our Faith and Practice. Hence in our Text they are &s;aid <HI>to make the Man of God perfect and thoroughly furni&s;h'd to every good Work;</HI> and hence they are call'd <HI>a Light to our Feet and a Lamp to our Paths,</HI> and expre&s;&s;ly, a Rule, Gal. 6.16. <HI>And as many as walk according to this Rule, Peace be upon them, and Mercy, and upon the I&s;rael of God.</HI> From this we mu&s;t not &s;werve to the right or left Hand. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> viii. 20. <HI>To the Law and to the Te&s;timony, if they &s;peak not according to this Word, it is becau&s;e there is no Light in them.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed the holy Scriptures, have <HI>only</HI> the Nature and Property's of a Rule, which are the&s;e following, 1&s;t. a Rule ought to be <HI>pre&s;crib'd</HI> by God alone. <HI>Mat.</HI> xv. 9. A Religious Rule cannot be pre&s;crib'd by another than him to whom the Per&s;ons ruled belong. And indeed the Su|blimity of the matter which &s;uch Rules concern, &s;ufficiently manife&s;t, that they cannot be well made by Creatures.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, A <HI>Rule</HI> ought to be <HI>receiv'd</HI> and <HI>Publick,</HI> other|wi&s;e how &s;hall it determine Controver&s;ies? And thus it is in
<PB N="81" REF="005500_0084_103967534C68E528">
re&s;pect of the Scriptures, they have been pre&s;crib'd by the publick Authority of God him&s;elf, and receiv'd by the common Con&s;ent of the Chri&s;tian Church, as has been before prov'd; and hence the Church is call'd the <HI>Pillar</HI> and <HI>Ground</HI> of Truth, 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 15.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, A <HI>Rule</HI> ought to be <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>plain,</HI> otherwi&s;e how can we know what we have to believe and do? And &s;o are the Scriptures, e&s;pecially in the Explication of &s;uch Things, as are of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to Salvation. And hence they are call'd <HI>a Light,</HI> and &s;aid <HI>not to be hid from us, Dut.</HI> xxx. 11. Where we meet with Ob&s;curity, this ari&s;es from the Sublimity of the Things treated of, or the Weakne&s;s of our under&s;tanding rather than from the Scriptures them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, A Rule ought to be <HI>perfect</HI> and <HI>adequate,</HI> or equal to the <HI>Thing ruled,</HI> &s;o that it need never to be augmented or dimini&s;h'd in the lea&s;t, otherwi&s;e it will be unfit to mea&s;ure its Object. Such is the Holy Scripture, there is nothing to be believ'd or done, but what it contains and pre&s;cribes. Now the Perfection of the Scriptures is two-fold, viz. <HI>in|tegral</HI> or <HI>Sy&s;tematical,</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ential,</HI> the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts in its full Number of Books, which is now compleat and the Can|non Seal'd, (<HI>Rev.</HI> xxii. 18.19.) the latter re&s;pects the Doctrine contain'd in tho&s;e Books; and this mo&s;t certainly is com|pleat, as our Text a&s;&s;erts, and many other Places. And hence we are bound to the Scripture alone as our Guide, by the &s;tricte&s;t Injunctions. (<HI>Deut.</HI> xvii. 18. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> viii. 20.) And forbid to add to it or detract from it, under the &s;evere&s;t Penalty's! (<HI>Deut.</HI> iv. 2. <HI>Rev.</HI> xxii. 18.19.) And inform'd that we &s;hall be at la&s;t judg'd by it. <HI>John</HI> xii. 42. And Rea&s;on will inform us, that it mu&s;t be perfect, &s;eeing that it is the fir&s;t Principle, and la&s;t Explication of our Faith. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 20, 21. If it were not &s;o, true and perfect Con|clu&s;ions cou'd not be drawn from it, for the Effect cannot be

better then its Cau&s;e. The &s;acred Scripture has all its e&s;&s;en|tial Parts, viz. <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Form,</HI> and all its integral, viz. <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and is therefore Perfect.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. A Rule ought to be <HI>con&s;tant</HI> and <HI>imoveable,</HI> ever|more and every where like to it&s;elf, otherwi&s;e how can any certain Mea&s;ure be rul'd by it, and &s;uch is the Holy Scrip|ture, 2 <HI>Pet,</HI> i. 19. <HI>We have a more &s;ure Word of Prophe&s;y, (bebaioteron propheticon logon.)</HI></P>
<P>Now the afore&s;aid Characters cannot be ju&s;tly a&s;crb'd to any thing el&s;e, that is obtruded for a Rule either by <HI>Jews, Papi&s;ts, Turks, Pagans, Dei&s;ts, Quakers, Antimonians:</HI> The Jewi&s;h <HI>Talmud</HI> and <HI>Cabula</HI> are private Things, de&s;titute of divine Authority, full of Ab&s;urdities, Fal&s;ehoods and Impi|eties again&s;t God and Man, as <HI>Gallatinus</HI> and <HI>Sextus Senen&s;is</HI> have made evident. The <HI>oral Tradition</HI> of the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> is of the &s;ame Stamp, they are extreamly uncertain, for while &s;ome of the Fathers a&s;&s;ert a particular Tradition to be Apo&s;tolical, others of them deny it. They are al&s;o contrary to the Writ|ten Word, and many of them changed according to the Circum&s;tances of Times, Places, and Per&s;ons. The <HI>Turki&s;h Alcoran</HI> is al&s;o utterly de&s;titute of the afore&s;aid Characters; the Author of it was a Mon&s;ter of Lu&s;t, having eleven Wives at one Time, be&s;ides Concubines, a ba&s;e Adulterer and a cruel Robber, as <HI>Andreas Maurus</HI> in his Treati&s;e again&s;t them, makes evident; and he was al&s;o an encourager of Robbery in his followers, as appears from the 19 and 71 <HI>Surat</HI> of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and in many Things it contradicts the Scrip|tures. The <HI>Pagan Morali&s;ts</HI> are likewi&s;e ab&s;urd and contra|dictory in many Things, as I have ob&s;erved before. Nei|ther can <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> be our <HI>Rule,</HI> as the <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Socinians</HI> dream; becau&s;e it is ob&s;cure and imperfect, (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 14.) And the ab&s;urd and contrary Sentiments of tho&s;e who had no other Guide, is a &s;ufficient Confirmation of this. Be&s;ides,
<PB N="83" REF="005500_0086_1039674FD51D1338">
&s;ome Things in Religion are Sublime and My&s;terious, and &s;o tran&s;cend the reach of Rea&s;on; yet they are not contrary to it: But tho' on the one Hand, we di&s;claim the <HI>Socinian</HI> Opinion, in making Rea&s;on the &s;upream Rule of Faith and Practice; yet on the other we equally dete&s;t the Foolry of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> who reject it altogether in the Affairs of Religion. Surely Religion <HI>is a rea&s;onable Service;</HI> Rea&s;on may and ought to be humbly us'd, in order to under&s;tand the meaning of the Rule God has given us. The <HI>Quakers</HI> notion, of the <HI>Spirit</HI> without the Word to be be our Rule, is a dangerous <HI>ignis fatuous,</HI> which may lead Men any where. Neither is the pretended <HI>new Nature</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> of the <HI>Antinomians</HI> and <HI>Moravians,</HI> while they reject the Ble&s;&s;ed Law of God and &s;light the Old Te&s;tament, a whit &s;afer Guide then <HI>will with the Wi&s;p!</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>has not come to de&s;troy the Law</HI> as the&s;e Men pretend; <HI>neither does Faith make void the Law!</HI></P>

It may be ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Manichean Hereticks,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Ana-Bapti&s;ts</HI> rejected it altogether, the Former as proceeding from a bad Principle and the latter becau&s;e we are &s;aid <HI>not to be under the Law, but under Grace;</HI> con|founding the Law, con&s;idered as a Covenant of Works, and the old Te&s;tament together, tho' Believers are not under the Cur&s;e of the Law, <HI>yet by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin, and the Law is Holy, Ju&s;t and Good.</HI> The Heretical <HI>Soci|nians</HI> imagine al&s;o, that the Religion of the New-Te&s;tament, differs e&s;&s;entially from that of the Old, and therefore that the Old is not nece&s;&s;ary to be read. The enthu&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Mora|vians</HI> do al&s;o &s;light the Old-Te&s;tament, and do endeavour to invalidate all Arguments drawn from thence.

<P>The Fool hath &s;aid in his Heart there is no God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Knowledge of the divine Exi&s;tence is the Foun|dation of all Religion, without this we cannot come to God, and &s;incerely &s;eek his Favour; where|fore it appears by the Law of Contraries, that the denial of a Supream Being mu&s;t needs be the fatal Source of all Impiety and Perfidy. And this the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> confirms <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 10.4. <HI>The Wicked through the Pride of his Coun|tenance will not &s;eek after God: God is not in all his Thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>The Evidences of a &s;upream Being, are &s;o many and ma|nife&s;t, that it mu&s;t needs be an In&s;tance of the greate&s;t fol|ly and impiety to call it in Que&s;tion: And yet this our Text informs us is the Practice of &s;ome, who&s;e Character and Cour&s;e we have therein a De&s;cription of, <HI>the Fool.</HI> This ignominious Epithet or Character is frequently and ju&s;tly a&s;|&s;igned to wicked Men in Scripture; for the Contraries of true Wi&s;dom realy belong to them, as appears thus, Wi&s;|dom directs to an End in the full Enjoyment of which we are compleatly Happy, as well as to Means that directly tend thereto, and excites to the Improvement of the afore|&s;aid Means in their proper Sea&s;on; whereas ungodly Per&s;ons either propo&s;e to them&s;elves an End which cannot yield compleat Satisfaction, namely &s;ome earthly Entertainment;
<PB N="87" REF="005500_0090_10396749251DD8A8">
or if they propo&s;e the Enjoyment of God in a future World as their End; they pur&s;ue contrary Mea&s;ures to attain it, <HI>viz.</HI> Sin and Impiety, and po&s;tpone the earne&s;t U&s;e of pro|per Means to &s;ecure an Intete&s;t in the divine favour, until the golden Sea&s;ons of divine Grace are elap&s;ed, It is cer|tainly a property of true Wi&s;dom, to exert principal Care and Labour to &s;ecure the mo&s;t valuable and enduring Good, and to avert the greate&s;t Evil: Whereas impenitent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors on the Contrary, bend their principal Labour and Solicitude in que&s;t of Trifles, which are of no Importance and Dura|tion; while in the mean Time they are &s;upinely and pro|fu&s;ely Negligent of immence and immortal Good, and there|by expo&s;e them&s;elves to interminable Mi&s;ery, and intolerable Vengeance! But this methinks is one of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing In&s;tances of the folly of Impenitents, which our Text records, namely, their que&s;tioning the Exi&s;tence of a &s;upream Being, <HI>the Fool hath &s;aid in his Heart:</HI> This Expre&s;&s;ion &s;eems to denote rather a De&s;ire that there was no God, than a Be|lief that there is none. When Per&s;ons go on in a cour&s;e of crim&s;on Impiety, as it is &s;aid <HI>of the Fool</HI> in our Text, <HI>they are corrupt, they have done abominable Works.</HI> Then they are di&s;po&s;ed to Que&s;tion the Exi&s;tence of an aveng|ing Judge, that &s;o they may Sin without Controul or Re|luctance: Doubtle&s;s &s;ome refactory Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors ince&s;&s;antly labour entirely to extingui&s;h the native Notices of a &s;upream Being in their Minds, that &s;o they may give a lawle&s;s un|bounded loo&s;e to their &s;en&s;itive Appetites, without the un|ea&s;y allay of a future Judgment.</P>

<P N="2">II. <HI>To expo&s;e the</HI> Athei&s;ts <HI>folly in Que&s;tioning it.</HI></P>
<P>And 1&s;t. Methinks the Subordination of Cau&s;es which we behold, and their Succe&s;&s;ion, manife&s;tly point to a fir&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="005500_0091_10396747A3A7BB38">
Cau&s;e; there hath been for &s;ome &s;tanding of Time, and there yet is, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Creatures in the World: Now the&s;e Creatures cannot make them&s;elves, for that which is not, cannot act: Nothing cannot be the Cau&s;e of &s;omething. To &s;uppo&s;e a Creature could produce it&s;elf, involves a mani|fe&s;t Ab&s;urdity in it, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is, and is not at the &s;ame Time, and that it acts before it exi&s;ts, which is impo&s;&s;ible: As it produces it mu&s;t be, for nothing cannot act; and as it is produc'd, it mu&s;t not be, and as the&s;e Creatures cannot make them&s;elves, &s;o neither can they make each other, for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e to create Something out of Nothing, is a Work that requires infinite Strength. (the di&s;tance be|tween nothing and &s;omething being infinite) Now no Crea|ture hath this Property of Almightyne&s;s, therefore it cannot act contrary to the fixed Laws of Nature in Creating: All that a Creature can do is only, in a natural Way, to give particular Forms to fit Materials, but the Matter it&s;elf he cannot produce. If the Creature could make him&s;elf, then it would follow, by a parity of Rea&s;on, that he could pre&s;erve him&s;elf, for the latter is no greater than the former. But manifold Experience proves the latter to be fal&s;e, and there|fore the former is &s;o from which this proceeds.</P>
<P>But farther, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of the Creatures making him&s;elf and others, it may be enquir'd, why he has made him&s;elf and tho&s;e of the &s;ame Species, &s;o Indigent and De|pendant on other Creatures for Support? Likewi&s;e how it comes to pa&s;s that he knows &s;o little of him&s;elf and others? Surely he that makes Things mu&s;t needs Under&s;tand them: From all which it appears, that Man could not make him|&s;elf and other Creatures.</P>
<P>But to bring this Argument re&s;pecting the Succe&s;&s;ion of Creatures, to a Cri&s;is, it may be ob&s;erv'd, that one or other
<PB N="89" REF="005500_0092_10396745CCDB07E8">
of the&s;e <HI>four</HI> Particulars re&s;pecting it will hold good <HI>viz.</HI> Either that the Succe&s;&s;ion is Infinite, or that the &s;ame Thing produces it &s;elf, or that there is a Circulation of Cau&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>A</HI> &s;hould be the Cau&s;e of <HI>B, B</HI> of <HI>C, C</HI> of <HI>D,</HI> and <HI>D</HI> of <HI>A</HI> again, or &s;ome fir&s;t Being who proceeds from none, whom we call <HI>GOD,</HI> there is not a fifth. Now the Three fir&s;t Particulars cannot be admitted without Contradiction, as for Example, an infinite Subordination or Succe&s;&s;ion of Cau&s;es, 1&s;t. infers that while that continues nothing can ex|i&s;t, than which nothing can be more fal&s;e: Now the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the afore&s;aid Con&s;equence appears thus, <HI>viz.</HI> nothing can exi&s;t except by its next Cau&s;e, which produces the Effect; But if an infinite Number of Cau&s;es mu&s;t preceed the next Cau&s;e, that next Cau&s;e would never exi&s;t, for there is no end to Infinity, and then it would follow, that there|fore nothing now exi&s;ts, which is ab&s;urd, and then 2dly That which is infinite would be rendered more, ina&s;much as to the &s;uppo&s;ed infinity of Cau&s;es we &s;ee daily new ones added, and thus there would be an infinite which was not Infinite, which is ab&s;urd; and further 3dly That order of prior and po&s;te|rior which is in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would be de&s;titute of a fir&s;t, from which all Flux or Motion in its own Nature exi&s;ts; where there is not a fir&s;t there cannot be a &s;econd or third, nei|ther can there be a &s;econd or third, where there is not a fir&s;t; and hence there would be a Succe&s;&s;ion, which is not a Succe&s;&s;ion; which is ab&s;urd: Therefore an infinite Suc|ce&s;&s;ion can by no Means be allow'd; neither can it be ad|mitted without the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity, that a Creature can produce it &s;elf for the Rea&s;ons afore&s;aid. If an Athei&s;t &s;hould object and &s;ay, that according to our Opinion God is of him&s;elf, we an&s;wer, it is true, He is of him&s;elf, yet he has not produced him&s;elf, He is of him&s;elf <HI>negatively,</HI> in|a&s;much as he is produced by no other; but he is not of
<PB N="90" REF="005500_0093_10396743F1042438">
him&s;elf <HI>po&s;itively,</HI> &s;o as to produce him&s;elf; and if the afore|&s;aid Circulation of Cau&s;es were admitted, then the &s;ame Creature would indirectly and mediately produce him&s;elf, ina&s;much as <HI>A</HI> by <HI>B, C,</HI> and <HI>D,</HI> would be the Cau&s;e of him|&s;elf. If the Athei&s;t again&s;t the afore&s;aid Rea&s;onings objects, that we do not &s;ee the Sun, Moon, and Stars to be produ|ced by others, to this it may be reply'd, that altho' we per|ceive not by our Sen&s;es that tho&s;e have been produced, ne|verthele&s;s by rea&s;on we may certainly infer this, and that from the following Topick, <HI>viz.</HI> We ob&s;erve all the&s;e Things to be finite, and &s;eeing that nothing can limit it&s;elf and its own Perfection, it is nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould derive its Being and Limitations therein from another. But more particularly, A</P>
<P N="2">2d. Argument to prove the Being of God is this, <HI>viz.</HI> The World is created, therefore God exi&s;ts: Here we &s;up|po&s;e what no Athei&s;t will deny, <HI>viz.</HI> That the World ex|i&s;ts, well then this World that now exi&s;ts has either pro|duced it&s;elf, or has been from Eternity, not produced or is produced by another, and that either of &s;omewhat pre-ex|i&s;ting, or of Nothing: If the latter holds, it is created, for Creation is but a Production of Something out of No|thing. Now to enforce this Argument let us briefly con&s;ider its Parts, and 1. that the World did not produce it &s;elf appears from what has been before ob&s;erved: For then it would be and not be at the &s;ame Time, which is impo&s;&s;ible from the Nature of Things. And 2dly that it did not exi&s;t from E|ternity, the following Particulars demon&s;trate</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Eternity is an Infinity, which a finite World is unca|pable of: If the Athei&s;t affirms the World to be infinite, he may be ea&s;ily confuted from the Parts of the World, which are either infinite or finite; if they be &s;aid to be infinite,
<PB N="91" REF="005500_0094_103967426E81F1E0">
then there are many Infinites and by Con&s;equece none, which is ab&s;urd; each Part would have all the Perfection of the Parts joyned with it, or not: If yea, then they would not be different, but one and the &s;ame, which our Eyes be|holding the Parts of the World prove to be fal&s;e, if nay, then it would not be infinite, but finite, and if the Parts of the World, be finite how can it &s;elf be infinite, can finite Cau&s;es produce an infinite Effect? No &s;urely! that is contrary to the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the World exi&s;ted from Eternity, then an infinite Number of Years, which Eternity implies, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have preceeded this Day, and &s;eeing that Number could ne|ver have been compleat, by con&s;equence this Day could ne|ver &s;ucceed, but we &s;ee it does &s;ucceed; And</P>
<P N="3">3. From the Suppo&s;ition of the Worlds Eternity it would fol|low, that &s;omething can be added to what is infinite, &amp; there|fore that there is an infinite which is not infinite, which is Ridiculous! For is not Eternity an infinite Duration, and yet according to the afore&s;aid Hypothe&s;is, Years, Months and Days are added to it; from which it follows, that infi|nite can be more than infinite, ina&s;much as the World which was before one Thou&s;and Years agone infinite in Duration, is now older, therefore it cannot be that the World &s;hould exi&s;t from Eternity.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Corruptibility of the Parts of the World, proves that it is not eternal, for what exi&s;ts externally exi&s;ts of it &s;elf, and &s;o exi&s;ts nece&s;&s;arily, and thus is not liable to Corrup|tion. That which borrows its Being of no other needs not &amp; &s;o depends not upon any other for the Continuation of its ex|i&s;tence, for that no other can de&s;troy. But we &s;ee the Ca&s;e is contrarywi&s;e with the Parts of the World, and therefore it is not eternal. <HI>It mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be acknowledged</HI> &s;ays
<Q><PB N="92" REF="005500_0095_10396740EC3DD9F8">Lucretius, that the World had a Beginning, otherwi&s;e tho&s;e Things which are in their own Nature corruptible, had ne|ver been able from all Eternity, to have held out again&s;t tho&s;e forcible and violent A&s;&s;aults, which in an infinite Du|ration mu&s;t have happened.</Q> I add, without the &s;uperintend|ance of an Almighty Being.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the World was eternal, <Q>How comes it to pa&s;s, <HI>&s;ays Lucretius,</HI> that the Poets &s;peak of nothing before the <HI>Tro|jan</HI> and <HI>Theban</HI> Wars?</Q> Was there nothing memorable done in infinite Ages worthy to communicated to Po&s;terity, or could they find no Ways in that va&s;t Space, to effect this till of late? How improbable are the&s;e Things? It is certain that divers profitable Inventions have been of late Years found out, &s;uch as Printing, the Gun, the Ver|tue of the Load&s;tone, and divers other Particulars; what &s;hould be the Rea&s;on that no Genius in infinite Ages &s;hould luckily hit upon the&s;e before, if the World was Eternal? Had not Men the &s;ame Incitements to &s;eek after &s;uch In|ventions before as now? And to &s;ay that Men of late Ages have more Wit than a &s;uppos'd infinite Number of Pre|dece&s;&s;ors, is too great and groundle&s;s a Compliment upon the pre&s;ent Generation, and &s;ome few that have preceed|ed it. But a</P>
<P N="3">3d. Argument is this, The World is pre&s;erved to this Day, therefore God exi&s;ts: For what is the Con&s;ervation of the World, but a continued Creation? with this Difference only, that the one includes a newne&s;s of exi&s;ting, which the other excludes. If the Athei&s;t &s;hould deny that the World is pre&s;erved, and &s;ay, that it endures only, as we &s;ay our God endures, without anothers Support: In an&s;wer to which we &s;ay, that it endures indeed but by Pre&s;ervation, and that becau&s;e it was produced by another, as has been before proved: And therefore the Difference between the Duration
<PB N="93" REF="005500_0096_1039673F48B249B0">
of God and the World is very va&s;t; God is &s;imply of him&s;elf, and therefore the Fir&s;t, and &s;o an independant Being, who needs not, and cannot receive Support from any other: Whereas the World is from another, and therefore mu&s;t be pre&s;erved by him to whom it owes its Original. The World mu&s;t be either pre&s;erved by it &s;elf or by another; not by it &s;elf, that which could not give to it &s;elf a Being, cannot pre&s;erve the Being it has received from another; and there|fore it mu&s;t be pre&s;erved by another, and who can this o|ther be, but he who gave it its Exi&s;tence? But if it was any other Thing that without doubt would be a Part of the World, and thus a Part would pre&s;erve the whole which is ab&s;urd!</P>
<P>Surely that which pre&s;erves a Part mu&s;t needs pre&s;erve the whole; moreover &s;eeing there are in the World divers Parts which are not only of a different kind, but contrary to each other, &s;uch as Fire and Water, &amp;c. which do con|tend again&s;t one another with all their Strength, what could keep them from de&s;troying each other, but the Power of their Almighty Former? A</P>
<P N="4">4th. Argument for the Exi&s;tence of a God may be drawn from the Government of the World. Here we pre&s;uppo&s;e what no Athei&s;t will deny, <HI>viz.</HI> that the World con&s;i&s;ts of various Parts, not only different but contrary, and many of them irrational, which neverthele&s;s harmoniou&s;ly concur to promote their own particular Perfection, and the general Good of the whole Univer&s;e, and that without their De|&s;ign, and contrary to their Nature, of Nece&s;&s;ity therefore they mu&s;t needs be governed, either by them&s;elves or another, not by them&s;elves, for many of them want Rea|&s;on and cannot be their own Guides, therefore it mu&s;t be by another, and who is he that is fit for &s;uch a &s;pacious and important Province, but an omnipre&s;ent, omnicient, omni|potent
<PB N="94" REF="005500_0097_1039673D7A8E0938">
and infinitely wi&s;e Being? When we behold the various Wheels of a Watch mutually helping on one De&s;ign, by their contrary Motions which they know not, we pre&s;ent|ly conclude, that &s;ome Workman has been there, and has formed the Wheels and adju&s;ted them to their proper Di&s;|tances, and by a Spring has put the Whole in Motion. If an Athei&s;t &s;hould &s;ay, that the former Order re&s;ults from the peculiar Nature of the Parts, we may ea&s;ily reply and &s;ay, but from whence is that Nature, Wi&s;dom and Order? When we behold the Harmony and Sub&s;erviency of the &s;everal Parts of the Creation to each other, we may ju&s;tly u&s;e the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI>'s Exclamation, and &s;ay, <HI>How manifold are thy Works O God, in Wi&s;dom ha&s;t thou made them all!</HI> The Sun enlight|ens and warms the Earth, which el&s;e would be but a me|lancholy and barren Place. The pregnant Clouds &s;hed their balmy Dews and gentle Drops, which prepare the Earth to produce its Fruits, which would be mar'd if the Water de&s;cended from the Clouds in Torrents, which it naturally tends to! And what le&s;s than Omnipotence, can &s;upport tho&s;e va&s;t Ci&s;terns of Water, I mean the Clouds, without a|ny Stronger Prop than the thin Air? Surely if they were left to their natural Gravity only, they would &s;oon innundate the World with a &s;econd Deluge! Dr. <HI>Bates</HI> ob&s;erves re&s;pecting the Situation of the Sun,
<Q>That if it was nearer the Earth it would &s;corch its Surface by too near an Approach, and if farther off, it would be oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch a multiplicity of cold moi&s;t Vapours as would ob&s;truct its Fruitfulne&s;s.</Q> Its al&s;o ob&s;ervable, that the Sun by its exhaling Vertue, &s;upplies from the Sea and moi&s;t Places of the Earth the empty Bot|tles of the vi&s;ible Heavens, that thus by this con&s;tant Cir|culation, the Earth being refre&s;hed, the Meads may laugh, the Fields be adorn'd with a grateful Verdure; and indeed the Winds are no le&s;s remarkable for their manifold U&s;e|fulne&s;s,
<PB N="95" REF="005500_0098_1039673B9ED2F5F0">
in carrying the ponderous Clouds to their Places, Ve&s;|&s;els to their Ports, and in refre&s;hing the Earth and the various Animals that live on its Surface, this &s;erves as a Fan to a&s;|&s;wage the &s;ummers &s;ultry Heat!</P>
<P>And does not the natural In&s;tinct of acting in a different Manner, which we behold in various Animals, give further Light and Force to this Argument? <HI>e. g.</HI> The more fierce and formidable, &s;uch as the Lyon, Bear, &amp;c. who could ea&s;ily devour Men, fly from them, and inhabit De&s;art Places of their own accord, while the more u&s;eful Animals &s;uch as the Hor&s;e, the Ox, &amp;c. being ignorant of their Strength to re&s;i&s;t, are tame and ea&s;ily &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Rule of weaker Men. With what &s;urpri&s;ing Sagacity does the Bird build her Ne&s;t, the Spider frame its Web, the Bee form its numerous Repo&s;itories to receive and pre|&s;erve the Sweets which with much Diligence he extracts from the opening Flowers? With what prudent careful Pro|vidence, does the Ant lay up her Winter-Store before its approach? And likewi&s;e the Squirrels, and yet the&s;e Crea|tures act without Rea&s;on or De&s;ign, mu&s;t it not then nece&s;|&s;arily follow, that there is a divine Government.</P>
<P>But methinks it &s;till illu&s;trates this Argument, when we con|&s;ider that the Wants of all Creatures are &s;upply'd: Creatures can no more provide for them&s;elves than they could make them&s;elves, and who is equal to this Task, but an all &s;uf|ficient infinite Being? If there was no Providence, how could this be effected? And can there be a Providence without a God? Is it not owing to this all governing Providence, that the weake&s;t Schemes are &s;ometimes crowned with Succe&s;s, and the be&s;t concerted prove abortive? <HI>Is not the Wi&s;dom of the Wi&s;e &s;ometimes de&s;troyed, and the Under&s;tanding of the Prudent brought to nought? Surely the Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong! Surely Promotion comes neither
<PB N="96" REF="005500_0099_1039656E25C1C580">
from the Ea&s;t, nor from the We&s;t, nor from the South; but God is the Judge, he putteth down one and &s;etteth up another!</HI></P>
<P>How amazing is the Conduct of Providence, in implant|ing in all Animals, rational and irrational, a natural Care for the Provi&s;ion of their Young Ones, which even the mo&s;t Savage &s;ort do &s;urpri&s;ingly manife&s;t? and do they not ge|nerally bring forth their Young in the Spring? A Sea&s;on when they are mo&s;t likely to be provided with Food for their Support! To what el&s;e than a divine Providence can we a&s;cribe the Provi&s;ion of the Brea&s;t, the Udder with its Milk for their Su&s;tenation? with their natural In&s;tinct with|out In&s;truction, to &s;eek Nouri&s;hment that Way? And it &s;hould not be pa&s;&s;ed over with Silence and Negligence, that tho&s;e Things which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Support of Man's Life are common, and may be attained by the poorer Sort by Labour and Indu&s;try, while curious Dainties, fit for the Support of Luxury, are co&s;tly and be|yond their Reach.</P>
<P>Is it the Effect of Chance that &s;ome of the Bea&s;ts of the Field have Weapons for their Defence? And that others have a natural Swiftne&s;s to fly from Danger, and that there be Caverns provided for their Security? Is it meer Chance that the Earth is &s;tor'd with a variety of Medicines and Man endued with a Capacity to u&s;e them for his Cure?</P>
<P>If the Sea, as &s;ome &s;ay, be higher than the Earth, what is it that puts Boundaries to its proud Surges and prevents a &s;econd Inundation, but divine Providence? And what but this keeps the Elements about us, and Humours within us in a due Temperature? What but this that re&s;trains the Wrath of our Enemies and pre&s;erves us from Ruin? If Hurtful In&s;ects were not de&s;toy'd by each other, or by the Cold Sea&s;on of the Year, would not they by their Num|bers devour the Fruits of the Earth and de&s;troy us? Now

<P N="6">6. Another Argument may be deriv'd from both the Parts of the Compound Man. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. From the Body. How curious and beautiful is its Structure? Infinitely exceeding all Works of Art! Surely <HI>we are fearfully and wonderfully made!</HI> While the Brutal Herds have a prone and grovelling A&s;pect, the Countenance of Man is erect, to contemplate the Heavens, where his Creator has his chief Seat of Re&s;idence! To &s;ignify as it were, where his chief delight &s;hould be fixt, and that he &s;hould as much exceed the lower Creation in the noblene&s;s of his Sentiments and Affections, as he does in the natural form of his A&s;pect! This the Poet expre&s;&s;es elegantly,
<Q><L>Os homini Sublime dedit, celumq tueri,</L>
<L>Ju&s;&s;it et erectos, ad Sydera tollere vultus.</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;ing variety of Features in the &s;mall compa&s;s of the Face, where all the Parts are the &s;ame, manife&s;ts the in|finite Wi&s;dom of the Architect! Without this we cannot know each other: And thus all the &s;ocial Offices on which human Happine&s;s depends, mu&s;t forever expire and termi|nate! The rude&s;t Barbarities and Impieties mu&s;t en&s;ue, and Men degenerate into a Herd of Bea&s;ts!</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="005500_0101_1039656ACC449830">How excellent are all the Parts of the human Body fitted, by their Form and Situation for Beauty, and all the U&s;es de|&s;ign'd by an intelligent Mind? The mi&s;placing of any Part, would make it as Mon&s;trous as U&s;eles! <HI>Galen</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, <Q>That if a Per&s;on &s;tudied an hundred Years to place any Part of the human Body in a different Situation, that it could not be done without marring its Beauty and Service.</Q> But there are &s;ome Parts of this Structure, which e&s;pecialy chal|lenge our Admiration! The <HI>Brain</HI> in its mazy Labyrinths, which is the Seat of the Nerves and &s;pring of Motion, who can enough admire or &s;ufficiently explain! The Eye with its various Coats, Humours and optick Nerve, by which our Sight is form'd. The Ear, with its Tymponum or Drum, on which the di&s;turbed Particles of Air vibrate and Cau&s;e a diver&s;ity of Sounds. The quick and con&s;tant Circulation of the Blood by the Dia&s;tole and Sy&s;tole of the Heart, through certain large Veins or openings and &s;huttings of it, Cau&s;es Pul&s;ation and pre&s;erves the natural Heat! When this grand Wheel is broken at the Ci&s;tern, the Stomack cea&s;es to dige&s;t its Food, the whole Body grows cold and livid, and all the Offices of Nature fail. How different is that natural Heat which the Circulation of the Blood promotes from all others? Fire will gradually con&s;ume it&s;elf, and all others which only have acquired Heat, will &s;oon grow Cold; whereas the former is pre&s;erved many Years without Wa&s;ting the Parts of the Body; and lea&s;t the Heart &s;hould be over heated by its continual Motion, which would be prejudicial to the whole frame, to pre&s;erve a due Tempe|rature, does not the Lungs &s;erve as a Fan to cool and re|frigerate it?</P>
<P>And do not the Union of the Body with the Soul, a Being of a different Nature, de&s;erve our Wonder, and manife&s;tly point to an infinitely Wi&s;e and Almighty Being as
<PB N="99" REF="005500_0102_103965690C746E48">
its Author? And thus I am led to &s;peak of the other Particular before mentioned, or the other Part of the compound Man, and indeed the mo&s;t noble, viz. <HI>the Soul,</HI> who&s;e excellent Powers and Capacities, if we do attentively &s;urvey, we &s;hall be obliged to conclude, <HI>that it is God that has formed the Spirit of Man within him.</HI> How rai&s;ed and noble a Faculty is the <HI>Human Mind,</HI> which can form Ideas of Things a|bove its own Nature? It reflects on Things pa&s;t, and this incites either our Plea&s;ure or Regret. It aims at the Pro&s;|pect of Things to come, and thus it alarms our Fears or &s;wells our Hopes! It beholds the Connection between Cau&s;es and their Effects, Premi&s;es and their Conclu&s;ion: It di&s;cerns the moral Beauty and excellency of Virtue and Religion!</P>
<P>The Will, through the Aids of divine Grace, can choo&s;e what is Good and refu&s;e what is Evil. The Soul by its Rea&s;onings evidently appears to be an Immaterial, and therefore an immortal Sub&s;tance; for it is impo&s;&s;ible from the nature of Things, that meer Matter, however modified and put in Motion, can produce rational Reflections: And if &s;o, then it mu&s;t be formed by an All-wi&s;e and Almighty Being who is God.</P>
<P>The Soul, by Rea&s;on of its &s;piritual and rational Nature, is capable of moral Government and Religion, it de&s;ires after God and indeed can be only Happy in the Enjoyment of him. And the immen&s;e and boundle&s;s de&s;ires of the Soul evidently argue the reality of a Supream Being: All the En|joyments of Sen&s;e, in their greate&s;t Affluence and Variety, do not &s;atisfy the cravings of our va&s;t De&s;ires! We &s;till reach after a more immen&s;e and adequate Good! Then either there mu&s;t be an infinite Being, in who&s;e Embraces we may attain the compleat Happine&s;s we in vain &s;eek el&s;ewhere, or el&s;e Nature has done &s;omething in vain, contrary to <HI>Ari&s;totle's</HI> ju&s;t Maxim: And thus the mo&s;t noble Creature of this
<PB N="100" REF="005500_0103_103965676D099A20">
lower World would be made in its primitive Con&s;titution more mi&s;erable than the Brute-Creation, which is very ab|&s;urd.</P>
<P N="7">7. Another Argument to prove the Being of a God, may be the exact Accompli&s;hment of certain Prophe&s;ies concern|ing future contingent Events: This the Mind of Man can|not perceive without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Divine Revelation: It's true we may judge that nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;es will produce Effects according to their Nature, but re&s;pecting <HI>Arbitrary,</HI> we cannot determine. Now that &s;everal &s;uch Prophe|&s;ies have come to pa&s;s, the Scriptures a&s;&s;ert, which ought to pa&s;s for a credible Hi&s;tory, till the Athei&s;t proves the Contrary.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Miraculous Works that have been wrought, prove the Being of a God; for who but he can give check to the cour&s;e of Nature, and controul it's fixed Laws and Or|der? And that &s;uch have been wrought is not only evi|dent from the Scriptures, but Prophane Writings. So that he mu&s;t needs be a <HI>Sceptick,</HI> and deny all human Te&s;ti|mony that denies this Fact! But to proceed,</P>
<P N="9">9. The Te&s;timony of Con&s;cience proves the Being of a God. Are not Men &s;ometimes terrified with the Dread of Puni&s;hment, becau&s;e of tho&s;e Evils which no human Eye has &s;een them Commit, and which no human Law takes cognizance of? and the&s;e unea&s;ine&s;&s;es they are not able totally to extingui&s;h by all the Arts of Diver&s;ion they can invent! Neither can any worldly Grandeur exempt there|from, witne&s;s <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Caligula.</HI> And on the Contrary what a &s;weet Calm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es pious Bo&s;ooms in the Way of Du|ty? which make them fearle&s;s of evil Tidings! add to this, that the univer&s;al Con&s;ent of all ages gives Te&s;timony to the divine Exi&s;tence. <HI>Tully</HI> and divers others a&s;&s;ert,
<Q>That there is no Nation &s;o barbarous but what has acknowledged a
<PB N="101" REF="005500_0104_10396565EA52BF50">
Deity. Some indeed were very gro&s;s in their Idolatry, wor&s;hip|ing <HI>Leeks</HI> and <HI>Onions, as</HI> Juvenal <HI>in his</HI> Satyrs <HI>ob&s;erves.</HI></Q> Now altho' tho&s;e unhappy Nations were mi&s;erably mi&s;|taken as to the Object of Wor&s;hip, yet their unanimous concurrence in paying divine Adoration to &s;omething, &s;hews their acknowledgment of a Deity.</P>
<P>If it be Objected, <HI>That Hi&s;tory informs us of &s;ome &s;pecu|lative Athei&s;ts that have been, and of &s;ome Countries in</HI> Africa <HI>and</HI> America <HI>that have no religious Wor&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The Number of &s;uch who have been recond <HI>&s;peculative Athei&s;ts</HI> has been very &s;mall, be&s;ides by the fear they have &s;ometimes di&s;covered, they have plainly inti|mated, that they rather wi&s;hed there was no God, than be|lieved there was none; and &s;uppo&s;ing they did, it will not weaken the Argument: Becau&s;e &s;ome are born Fools will it follow that Rea&s;on is not natural to Man? As to the o|ther Particulars, the Facts are not &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted, tho&s;e that have a&s;&s;erted them have not had familiarity enough with the Indians to know their Notions of a Deity: But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome &s;hould &s;o far degenerate into Brutes, as to lay a&s;ide the U&s;e of their Rea&s;on in this Point, it cannot conclude again&s;t the Majority who act rationally, and ar|gue from the Principles of Rea&s;on they are endowed with, the Exi&s;tence of a Deity!</P>
<P>If it be objected, that God is not becau&s;e he is not &s;een.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> This is &s;ordid: Then the Soul is not, becau&s;e it is not &s;een, and thus the&s;e Men are Brutes in their own Account.</P>
<P>If it be again objected, <HI>That the Wicked are pro&s;perous and the Righteous afflicted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> What then, is not God a Sovereign, may not he do what he will with his own? But if it be further con|&s;idered,
<PB N="102" REF="005500_0105_10396563F519D770">
that outward Pro&s;perity does not prevent inward Terror, and that good Men are made better by Afflictions, that divine Joy is con&s;i&s;tent with them, and that there will be a future Judgment, the Objection evani&s;hes.</P>
<P>But &s;ome do further Object, <HI>That the Notion of a God is a piece of State Policy, invented for the Benefit of Civil Go|vernment, propagated by Tradition, and &s;upported by Fear.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> But who was the Man, or &s;et of Men, that invented this, and when and where did they live? Or when was the World without all Belief of a Deity? Here the Athei&s;t is nonplu&s;t! If the great Men of the Earth had invented the Notion of a God, is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that they them&s;elves would be &s;ubject to the Terrors of it, as others have been? And if the Belief of a God was a human In|vention, how comes it to be &s;o univer&s;ally received, and that without the Methods of Force? And why was the Impo&s;ture never di&s;covered in &s;o long a Tract of Time?</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the Belief of a Deity has been propagated only by Tradition, for it is bot|tomed on the highe&s;t Rea&s;on, has univer&s;ally obtained, and continued in all the Changes of Time and Revolutions of Nations; whereas Notions received with implicit Faith by Tradition, are not grounded on Rea&s;on; are not uni|ver&s;ally received, but liable to change and mutation!</P>
<P>It's likewi&s;e equally ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Fear of Puni&s;hment &s;hould give ri&s;e to the Belief of a Deity: For why &s;hould Men be afraid of Puni&s;hment for &s;ecret-Crimes, if there was no God to puni&s;h? Surely their Fear &s;uppo&s;es a God, and is the Effect of this Per&s;wa&s;ion. And how then can the Effect produce its Cau&s;e? Not to add that the primary Notion we have of God is, that <HI>he is a good and lovely Being.</HI> The fearful Apprehen&s;ions of his Ven|geance are but &s;econdary and the Fruit of Guilt,</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="005500_0106_1039656258812D98">What has been ob&s;erved &s;hews us the folly of <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> both <HI>Speculative</HI> and <HI>Practical!</HI> But this appears more par|ticularly in the in&s;tances following; how ridiculous is the <HI>Epicurian</HI> Account of the Original of the World, viz. <HI>That this beautiful Structure &s;hould &s;pring from the fortuitous Concour&s;e of Atoms in an immen&s;e Space!</HI> It is as likely, as <HI>Tully</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>That all the Materials of a magnificent Edifice &s;hould of their own accord meet and unite together.</Q>
<Q>How long <HI>(&s;ays a learned Man)</HI> might a Per&s;on jumble a &s;et of Letters together, or fling them on the Ground, be|fore they would fall into an exact Poem; yea or &s;o much as make a good Di&s;cour&s;e in Pro&s;e?</Q> The <HI>&s;peculative Athei&s;t</HI> likewi&s;e &s;hews his folly in requiring upon the one &s;ide, more evidence for Things than they are capable of! He a&s;ks mathematical Demon&s;tration in moral and religious Matters, which can only be proved by moral Arguments and credible Te&s;timony; their Nature admiting no other kind of Proof: But on the other &s;ide he labours to believe by im|plicit Faith, again&s;t Rea&s;on and Argument, that the Be|lief of a God has been only propogated by Tradition, but cannot Account for his Notion.</P>
<P>Again the Athei&s;t's folly appears in this,
<Q>That he pre|tends to know certainly what no Man can be certain of, viz. that there is no God. If he is not certain, how fooli&s;h is it to deny and de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch a Being as God is! But how from the nature of Things can a Man be certain of a meer Ne|gative, unle&s;s it implies a Contradiction, which the Being of a God does not. To profe&s;s certainty here, is in other Words, to pretend to the Knowledge of all Things that are or can be; which is fooli&s;hly arrogant with a Witne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Further, there is this great Contradiction in the denial of a God, <HI>viz.</HI> He a&s;&s;erts that to be impo&s;&s;ible which yet he mu&s;t grant to be po&s;&s;ible. For if there is no God already,
<PB N="104" REF="005500_0107_103965605B96CE20">
it's impo&s;&s;ible now there &s;hould be One, becau&s;e Eternity is e&s;&s;ential to the Idea of a God. And yet the <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> mu&s;t grant it po&s;&s;ible that there &s;hould be &s;uch a Being, who hath all po&s;&s;ible Perfection, whom we call GOD.</Q></P>
<P>Again, as <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> deprives a Man of Happine&s;s in the next World, &s;o it robs him of Comfort in this. For as it is inconte&s;tably evident,
<Q>that Man cannot be his own Happi|ne&s;s, he cannot &s;atisfy his own De&s;ires or ward off the E|vils he is inviron'd with; &s;o his principal Support amid&s;t the numerous Di&s;quietudes of Life, is Hopes of Protection and Happine&s;s from this Supream Being. This <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> cuts entirely off, and &s;o &s;huts up the chiefe&s;t Spring of Support and Sweetne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Once more, the <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> &s;hews his folly in contending a|gain&s;t the devout Man in this In&s;tance, upon unequal grounds, for he ventures his everla&s;ting Intere&s;ts; whereas the religious Man ventures only the lo&s;s of his Lu&s;t and &s;ome &s;hort liv'd inconveniencies. He is better in all Re&s;pects without his Lu&s;ts, they are but a di&s;ea&s;e which mar the the true Comfort of Life; and as for other inconveniences, the Peace of his Mind and Expectation of future Happi|ne&s;s will enable him to comport with them comfortably, &s;o that he is at lea&s;t upon a par with the <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> as to the com|forts of this Life: And after Death he is as well of as the <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> if there be no God, but if there be a God he is infinitely better of. If the Arguments for and again&s;t the Being of a God were equal, yet the Danger is &s;o unequal that Prudence would incline us to choo&s;e the Affirmative, and make that the Mea&s;ure of Life.</Q></P>
<P>I need not Mention how de&s;tructive athei&s;tical Princi|ples are to all the Intere&s;ts of Society. They open the Flood-gates of Inju&s;tice and Prophanene&s;s and incite Men to &s;in without Controle! As there are many Evils preju|dicial
<PB N="105" REF="005500_0108_1039655ED45F5500">
to Society, which no human Laws can &s;ufficiently provide again&s;t. If the Re&s;traints of Religion be removed, we lie open to a thou&s;and Wrongs and In&s;ults, e&s;pecially where the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or has hopes of &s;ecre&s;y; and therefore while the Athei&s;t &s;ugge&s;ts that the Belief of a God is a Trick of the State, he implicitly acknowledges, to the Honour of Religion, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to the Government of Man|kind. And without Government, Rea&s;on will inform us, that the wilde&s;t Barbarities would be committed, and Scenes of Blood and De&s;olation opened!</P>
<P>But is not the <HI>practical Athei&s;t</HI> &s;till a greater Fool than the <HI>Speculative,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, who pretends to believe a God and yet lives as if there was none! Such Per&s;ons bid defiance to Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience in Matters of the greate&s;t Con&s;e|quence. By their Lives they labour to confute their Faith, and ru&s;h into Damnation with their Eyes open!</P>
<P>Let us therefore Brethren be intreated to labour to get a more full Per&s;ua&s;ion and deep Sen&s;e of the Exi&s;tence of a God upon our Minds, and of the Account which we mu&s;t quickly render to him of our pre&s;ent Steward&s;hip. To this End let us think on the Arguments that have been offered. Let us oppo&s;e the Temptations of Satan to the contrary. Let us behold the&s;e three great Leaves of the Volumn of Crea|tion, viz. the <HI>Heavens, Earth</HI> and <HI>Sea</HI> with their Contents, and con&s;ider, their immen&s;ity and admirable Structure!</P>
<P>Let us look into the &s;acred Oracles, every Page of which proclaims a God, by reading of which <HI>Junius</HI> was convinced of his Athei&s;m. Let us look up to God by Prayer. Let us carefully avoid what&s;oever tends to Athei&s;m. Among others, let us avoid the&s;e evil Principles, 1&s;t. That a Man may be &s;aved in his Religion be it what it will: This the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks again&s;t Eph. iv. 14, 15. <HI>That we be not henceforth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;&s;ed about with every Wind of Doctrine,</HI> and the Prophet

<P>And as we &s;hould avoid corrupt Principles, &s;o likewi&s;e evil Practices, which tend to blind the Mind and harden the Heart and provoke the Almighty to give up Per&s;ons to be deluded by the Devil: The Law of Sin, which is &s;trengthned by the Practice of it, inclines Per&s;ons to hate the Law of God, and by Con&s;equence the Law-giver, and hence they are inclined to que&s;tion, di&s;pute and deny his Being, from all which may the good Lord deliver us all. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>It is true, the <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of God being <HI>incomprehen&s;ible,</HI> can|not be fully repre&s;ented by any Name, and hence is <HI>Solo|mon</HI>'s Query, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxx. 4. <HI>What is his Name, and what is his Sons Name if thou can&s;t tell?</HI></P>
<P>And ina&s;much as God is a mo&s;t &s;ingular Being, by his Nature mo&s;t di&s;tinct from all others; therefore he needs not an <HI>appelative Name,</HI> whereby Species in the &s;ame Kind are di&s;tingui&s;hed; or a <HI>Proper Name,</HI> by which individuals of the &s;ame Species are di&s;tingui&s;hed.

<P>Now the Name of God in Scripture, Sometimes &s;ignifies 1.

<P>Here it may be ob&s;erv'd, that all the Names of God, be&s;ides <HI>Jehovah,</HI> tho' in &s;trict propriety, they belong to the Almighty only, yet improperly, and by way of Analogy or Re&s;emblance, they are a&s;crib'd to Creatures.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid upon this Head may excite us to be|ware of prophaning the Names of God either in our <HI>Hearts</HI> by <HI>Ignorance,</HI> or <HI>Forgetfulne&s;s,</HI> or by our <HI>Lips</HI> by a <HI>ra&s;h</HI> and <HI>irreverent u&s;e of them,</HI> or by our <HI>Lives</HI> thro' <HI>impiety.</HI> The great God, has &s;aid, <HI>that he will not hold them guiltle&s;s that take his Name in vain!

<P>But I proceed to the 2d. general Head, which was to di&s;|cour&s;e, upon tho&s;e particular Attributes of God, which are &s;ignify'd by the Name I AM or <HI>Jehovah.</HI> Here more general|ly it may be ob&s;erv'd, that the Attributes of God are &s;o call'd, becau&s;e we a&s;cribe them to him! <HI>They are the e&s;&s;en|tial Property's of God, by which we attain &s;ome Knowledge of his Being:</HI> or in other Words, <HI>they are that one infinite Perfection of God, which thro' the Weakne&s;s and Finitene&s;s of our Under&s;tandings, we conceive by various Acts, as it were by Parts,</HI> ju&s;t as when we would &s;ee the whole Ho|rizon, which is but one, we u&s;e various Acts of &s;eeing, looking to the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, South, until we &s;ee the whole! All the divine Attributes are in God, but <HI>one pure</HI> and <HI>&s;imple Act.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible that that Being, who is ab|&s;olutely the fir&s;t, &s;hould be compos'd of different Things for this would &s;uppo&s;e a Compo&s;er prior to the Fir&s;t, which is impo&s;&s;ible! Neither can an infinite Being con&s;i&s;t of different Things: For the&s;e Things mu&s;t be either infinite or finite. Many infinites imply a Contradiction, neither can many finite Cau&s;es produce an infinite Effect: Neither can an im|mutable and incorruptible Being con&s;i&s;t of different Things, for where one Thing is compounded with another it may be &s;eparated from it, and thus Change and Corruption would en&s;ue!</P>
<P>Some Divines do di&s;tingui&s;h the Attributes of God, into tho&s;e that are <HI>communicable</HI> &amp; <HI>incommunicable.</HI> The <HI>communica|ble Attributes</HI> of <HI>God are &s;uch as we find &s;ome Shadow of in intelligent Beings;</HI> of this Kind, are his <HI>Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice,
<PB N="112" REF="005500_0115_10396553240C9F58">
Goodne&s;s, Truth.</HI> We find &s;omething like the&s;e in Creatures, tho' with va&s;t Di&s;proportion! in God they are infinitely, but in Creatures in a limited and finite Manner.</P>
<P>But the <HI>incommunicable Attributes of God,</HI> are &s;uch <HI>as we find no Shadow of in Creatures.</HI> Of this Kind are his <HI>Inde|pendency, Eternity, Immutability</HI> and <HI>Incomprehen&s;ibility.</HI> The&s;e &s;hew how infinitely di&s;tant God is from all Crea|tures in re&s;pect of Dignity and Excellency, and how he is oppos'd to every Imperfection in them.</P>
<P>Now to a&s;&s;i&s;t our Conception of the divine Attributes, the&s;e Things following may be ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P N="1">1. That &s;eeing all the Attributes of God con&s;titute but one &s;imple Act, as has been before ob&s;erv'd, therefore no Degrees of Inequality are to be admitted among them, <HI>in|wardly,</HI> and on God's Part, all and &s;ingular of them import infinite Perfection, which admits not of more or le&s;s, not|with&s;tanding it may be, that <HI>outwardly</HI> one Attribute may extend it&s;elf to more Objects than another, in which Sen&s;e the Under&s;tanding may be &s;aid to be greater than the Will. Or it may act with more Inten&s;ene&s;s upon one Object than another, in which Sen&s;e God loves the Elect more than the Reprobate. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. Much le&s;s can any Contrariety be admitted among them, if any &s;uch Thing &s;eems to appear between Mercy and vindicative Ju&s;tice, this is altogether in the Object, about which the uniform Perfection of God, becau&s;e of its own Infinity, is occupied various Ways, or it is to be a&s;crib'd to our different Ways of conceiving of the divine Perfecti|on. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. When we think upon the Divine Attributes we mu&s;t remove far from them, all that Imperfection, which cleaves to &s;uch like Properties in Creatures, and conceive that the remaining Perfection is attended with the highe&s;t Eminence in God.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="113" REF="005500_0116_103965518411EE60">4. All the divine Attributes do truly belong to God, he is not only in re&s;pect of our Thought, but in Regard of the Condition of his own Nature, wi&s;e, good, ju&s;t. And they belong to him not in the <HI>concrete</HI> only as they do to Creatures, but in the <HI>Ab&s;tract.</HI> He is not only wi&s;e, ju&s;t, good, but <HI>Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s.</HI> In Creatures they are &s;econdarily, by way of Quality &s;uperaded to their Being, but in him they are primarily without De|rivation, and therefore his very Being it &s;elf. But here, before I proceed to a more particular Con&s;ideration of the divine Attributes, I &s;hall offer a Word of Improvement, from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>Methinks the general Theory of divine Perfections &s;erves to &s;trengthen our Faith exceedingly, in re&s;pect of the Trinity: Seeing that the incommunicable Attributes of God which coinceede with the divine E&s;&s;ence, are not only a&s;crib'd to the Father, but to the Son and Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>And with what Firmne&s;s and Freedom may we tru&s;t in God, and approach to his Throne of Grace &s;eeing there is &s;uch a Concour&s;e of Perfections in him, <HI>viz.</HI> of Wi&s;dom, Power, Goodne&s;s, &amp;c. of which every one is infinite, eternal, and immutable!</P>
<P>What powerful Incitements do the divine Attributes Mini&s;ter to our Prai&s;e, Reverence, and Obedience, of and to the Sacred Trinity? And how happy is that People who have &s;uch a great and glorious God for their Portion and Inheritance? Well might the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;ay, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is that Peo|ple who&s;e God is the Lord, P&s;al.</HI> xxxiii. 12. When God is ours then all his Attributes are ours, and engaged to pro|mote our Benefit (<HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 31.) And his immutability a&s;|&s;ures us, that he will remain ours to all Eternity, (<HI>Mal.</HI> iii. 6.) His Truth is inviolable, and therefore we may with un&s;hak|en Confidence, re&s;t on his Promi&s;es, which cannot fail!
<PB N="114" REF="005500_0117_1039654FAB7D8798">
His Love and Goodne&s;s may calm us in all Adver&s;ity, be|cau&s;e they will cau&s;e it to i&s;&s;ue in our Benefit. His Wi&s;dom and Power enable him to do for us all that we need, and his Mercy inclines him to forgive our Sins, and to exert the other Attributes of his Nature in our Behalf.</P>
<P>But I proceed to a more particular Con&s;ideration, of the&s;e Attributes of God which are &s;ignified by the Name I AM, the fir&s;t of which is his <HI>Incomprehen&s;ibility.</HI></P>
<P>The E&s;&s;ence of God as it is in it&s;elf, is inacce&s;&s;ible to our Under&s;tandings. The I&s;raelites enquire of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> of God, Concerning a Name which might repre&s;ent his <HI>E&s;|&s;ence,</HI> and while the Almighty an&s;wers, I AM THAT I AM, reproving the Folly of the Que&s;tion, what does it &s;ig|nify, but that his E&s;&s;ence is <HI>incomprehen&s;ible,</HI> and therefore <HI>inexpre&s;&s;ible!</HI> The &s;ame Thing which <HI>Zophar</HI> teaches his Friend, in plainer Terms. <HI>Job.</HI> xi. 7, 8, 9. <HI>Can&s;t thou by &s;earching find out God? Can&s;t thou find out the Almighty unto Perfection? It is as high as Heaven, what can&s;t thou do? Deeper than Hell, what can&s;t thou know? The Mea&s;ure there|of is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea!</HI> And hence he is &s;aid <HI>to dwell in Light inacce&s;&s;ible, which no Mortal Eye hath &s;een nor can &s;ee.</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> vi. 16. neither with the Eyes of the Body, or of the Mind; and hence he is call'd <HI>the invi&s;ible God,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 17. Therefore the Almighty deny'd to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> a Sight of his Face, while in the mean Time he &s;hew'd him his back Parts. By all our Contemplations we rather know what the E&s;&s;ence of God is not than what it is. Now the Rea&s;ons of the Point under our pre&s;ent Con|&s;ideration, are the&s;e following, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The Being of God is infinite and therefore cannot be comprehended by a finite Mind. 2. The Divine E&s;&s;ence is a mo&s;t pure and &s;imple Act, void of all Compo&s;ition, and therefore cannot be po|&s;itively conceiv'd of; and hence the Apo&s;tle calls <HI>Jehovah,</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="005500_0118_1039654E299E3C60">
not a Sub&s;tance &s;hining in the Concrete, but Light in the Ab&s;tract; and therefore he is not, nor cannot be &s;een. 3. The Being of God is mo&s;t &s;imply one, by which it is &s;o different from all Creatures, that it agrees with them in no|thing; and therefore no Idea of the divine E&s;&s;ence can be borrow'd from them. And how then can a proper Defini|tion thereof be formed by us.</P>
<P>But it may be objected again&s;t what has been &s;aid under this Head, that the Scriptures informs us, that God has been &s;een by many of the Saints, particularly by <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob, Mo&s;es, I&s;aiah,</HI> and others, <HI>Job</HI> was per&s;uaded that with <HI>the &s;ame Eyes he &s;hould &s;ee God,</HI> and the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> informs us, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 12. that <HI>here we &s;ee darkly, but then,</HI> meaning in Heaven, <HI>we &s;hall &s;ee Face to Face.</HI> The a|fore&s;aid Places are to be under&s;tood either of a &s;ymbolical Vi&s;ion, not of the E&s;&s;ence, but of the Operations of God, under certain Signs, or of the more perfect Knowledge of God, which will be attain'd in the Paradi&s;e of God; which in its Perfection &s;hall imitate Sight or Knowledge by it, yea exceed it; but they do not infer the Vi&s;ion of his E&s;&s;ence.</P>
<P>But that the Meaning of what has been offer'd, may be the better under&s;tood; it is to be ob&s;erved that our Di&s;cour&s;e is not concerning God, but the E&s;&s;ence of God as it is con|ceiv'd di&s;tinct from his Attributes, or as it is conceived, as &s;omething &s;ub&s;tracted or as the fir&s;t Being, which the At|tributes perfect. And 2. our Di&s;cour&s;e is not concerning the E&s;&s;ence of God that it is, for that is many Ways evident; but what it is in it&s;elf, and not in the Attributes. This our Minds can have no apprehen&s;ive or comprehen&s;ive Know|ledge of, for the Rea&s;ons before mentioned. And indeed in this Re&s;pect we cannot know the E&s;&s;ence of Angels, or of our own Souls?</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="005500_0119_1039654C89B411E0">Is the Divine E&s;&s;ence incomprehen&s;iible, then 1. this &s;hould repre&s;s carnal Curio&s;ity which appears in Enquiries about Things too high for us, and inacce&s;&s;ible to us, and a|bout Things we need not to know for O&s;tentations &s;ake, or &s;ome other mean End, or in bold Sayings about what we under&s;tand not; as for Example, when Per&s;ons &s;ay that the Divine E&s;&s;ence is but a Thought as the <HI>Carte&s;ians, &s;uch are wi&s;e above what is written,</HI> 1.

As al&s;o how ea&s;y and dangerous it is for us to mi&s;take in Matters of &s;o great Moment? <HI>Job</HI> xlii. 7. <HI>And it was &s;o that after the Lord had &s;poken the&s;e Words unto</HI> Job, <HI>the Lord &s;aid unto</HI> E|liphaz <HI>the</HI> Temanite, <HI>my Wrath is kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed again&s;t thee, and a|gain&s;t thy two Friends, for ye have not &s;poken of me the Thing that is right, as my Servant</HI> Job <HI>hath.</HI></P>
<P>But I proceed to con&s;ider the 2. Attribute of God, which is &s;ignified by the Words I AM, <HI>viz.</HI> his Self-Exi&s;tence or Independancy. The Almighty by tho&s;e Words, informs <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> that he was ab&s;olutely in and of him&s;elf, not <HI>po&s;itive|ly,</HI> as tho' he had produced him&s;elf, but <HI>negatively,</HI> be|cau&s;e his Being and Perfections were deriv'd of no other; or in other Words, the Almighty by the afore&s;aid Expre&s;&s;ion declares him&s;elf, to be ab&s;olutely the fir&s;t Being, and intire|ly
<PB N="118" REF="005500_0121_103965491062FDF8">
independent of any other prior Cau&s;e, either <HI>Efficient</HI> by whom he &s;hould be; or <HI>material</HI> of whom he &s;hould be, or <HI>formal</HI> by whom he &s;hould be, what he is; or <HI>final</HI> to whom as an End he &s;hould be directed. All Creatures live and move, and have their Beings in and from God, but it is his peculiar Glory, to derive his Being from none.</P>
<P>From the Fir&s;tne&s;s, A&s;eity, Self-Exi&s;tence, and Independ|ance of the Divine E&s;&s;ence or Being, naturally and nece&s;|&s;arily follows, the Independance of all his Attributes <HI>e.g.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. His Goodne&s;s is independant, he vouch&s;afes Benefits up|on whom, and when he plea&s;es, his meer Sovereignty alone determines not only the Objects and Time of conferring his Kindne&s;&s;es, but al&s;o the <HI>Kind, Mea&s;ure</HI> &amp; <HI>Duration</HI> of them. <HI>He hath Mercy upon whom he will have Mercy,</HI> nothing with|out him&s;elf can influence, far le&s;s con&s;train him: For this would argue Imperfection and Dependance.</P>
<P N="2">2. His Holine&s;s is independent, he hates Sin, not for any Rea&s;ons without him&s;elf, but becau&s;e of the eternal Con|trariety of his Nature thereto.</P>
<P N="3">3. His Power is likewi&s;e independent, as he has deriv'd it from none, &s;o he depends upon none in the Exerci&s;e there|of.

<P N="4">4. The Wi&s;dom of God is independent, his Wi&s;dom is not in him, as a Quality added to his Being, as it is in Creatures, but it is him&s;elf, he receives not his Ideas from Objects without him&s;elf, as Creatures do, in which re&s;pect they are dependant on them; but the Knowledge of God was infinite, before any Creature had a Being.

Now from this Fir&s;tne&s;s or Self-Exi&s;tence of God; proceed his Unity, Immutability, Infinity and Simplicity. And 1. his <HI>Unity.</HI> What is ab&s;olutely the fir&s;t Being, mu&s;t needs be one; for if more &s;uch be imagin'd, neither will be ab&s;olutely the fir&s;t, becau&s;e it does not preceed the other. 2. <HI>Immuta|bility;</HI> If he is changed, he is changed by another, and that other mu&s;t be before him, but what can be before him that is ab&s;olutely the Fir&s;t? 3. His <HI>Infinity.</HI> What&s;oever is limitted, is limitted by another, for nothing can limit it&s;elf, and its own Perfection, &amp; that other mu&s;t be before it, but what can be be|fore him who is ab&s;olutely the fir&s;t? 4. His <HI>Simplicity.</HI> What|&s;oever is compos'd, is compos'd by one prior to it&s;elf; but what can be before the Fir&s;t? Again the <HI>Independance</HI> of God, appears evidently from his producing all Things by his Pow|er. Such Things as he has made mu&s;t needs depend upon his Power and Plea&s;ure for their Being and Support, now if they depend on him, how can it be that he &s;hould de|pend on them? To &s;uppo&s;e the Cau&s;e and Effect to be mutually dependant on each other, is to &s;uppo&s;e they are mutually deriv'd from each other, which is impo&s;&s;ible!
<PB N="120" REF="005500_0123_10396545E7851890">
Once more, if God be infinitely above the noble&s;t Crea|tures, then he cannot depend on them, for dependance argues inferiority. Now that God is above all created Beings, is mo&s;t manife&s;t. <HI>The Nations are but as the Drop of a Bucket, as the &s;mall Du&s;t of the Balance, yea as no|thing and le&s;s then nothing and Vanity,</HI> as the Royal Pro|phet ob&s;erves, with noble Pomp of Diction.

On the Contrary let us conclude that all our Springs are in God, from him all our Ble&s;&s;ings flow; he is the only Source of our Happine&s;s, the Foundation of our Hope, the Author and fini&s;her of our Faith.

<P N="3">3dly, We may hence learn the Sinfullne&s;s and Danger of oppo&s;ing God's Sovereignty, either 1&s;t. Openly by wi&s;h|ing it aboli&s;h'd, (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> 14. 1, <HI>and</HI> 10, 4.)

<P>And 2dly, That God is eminently all being, he is omni|cient and perfectly knows our wants, he is omnipotent, and can ea&s;ily &s;upply them, in his Hand is Power and Might.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>EXODUS, iii. 14.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And God &s;aid unto <HI>Mo&s;es, I AM THAT I AM:</HI> And he &s;aid, thus &s;halt thou &s;ay unto the Children of I&s;rael, <HI>I AM</HI> hath &s;ent me unto you.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN Di&s;cour&s;ing on this Text you may remember, that in the preceeding Sermon after an Explication of it and more general Ob&s;ervations upon the divine Attributes, I proceeded to &s;peak upon two particulars, namely, the <HI>Incomprehen&s;ibility</HI> and <HI>Independency of God,</HI> which I appre|hended were included in it. And moreover made mention of two others, which I am now to di&s;cour&s;e upon, viz. the <HI>Eternity</HI> and <HI>Immutability of God.</HI> In &s;peaking upon the <HI>Eternity of God,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to explain, confirm and Improve this great Truth. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Word <HI>Eternity</HI> &s;ometimes &s;ignifies, a long &s;pace of Time that hath both a <HI>Beginning</HI> and <HI>End.</HI> Thus he that &s;erv'd to the Year of Jubilee, is &s;aid <HI>to &s;erve for ever, Ex.</HI> xxi. 6. And &s;o the Ceremonial Laws are &s;aid <HI>to be forever, Num.</HI> x. 8. 2dly. Sometimes it &s;ignifies a <HI>Dura|tion,</HI> which has a Beginning but no End. Thus it is with the Angels and our own Souls. And 3dly. Sometimes it &s;ignifies a <HI>Duration</HI> without Beginning or End, which is ap|plicable to God only, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other Sig|nifications
<PB N="126" REF="005500_0129_1039653BC9A256D0">
by redoubling of the Words thus, <HI>forever and ever,</HI> from <HI>everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P>Various De&s;criptions are given by different Divines of Eternity.
<Q>That is properly Eternal (<HI>&s;ays</HI> Petavius) which never had a Beginning nor never can cea&s;e to be.</Q>
<Q>Eter|nity (<HI>&s;ay</HI> Drexilius, Barlow, and Prideaux) is an ever pre&s;ent <HI>Duration,</HI> it is one perpetual Day, which pa&s;&s;es not into what is pa&s;t or future.</Q>
<Q>That is Eternal (<HI>&s;ays</HI> Zanchy) which wanting Beginning and Ending is &s;till the &s;ame.</Q>
<Q>Eternity (<HI>&s;ays</HI> Boetius) is a full and perfect Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of interminable or everla&s;ting Life together and at once.</Q></P>
<P>But the mo&s;t ea&s;y and intelligible De&s;cription thereof is this, viz. <HI>that it is an imcommunicable Perfection or Property of the Deity, whereby his Duration is without Beginning, Succe&s;&s;ion and End.</HI></P>
<P>And 1&s;t. That the <HI>Duration</HI> of the Almighty was with|out <HI>Beginning,</HI> is evident both from Scripture and Rea&s;on, Deut. xxxiii. 27. <HI>The eternal God is thy Refuge, and under|neath are the everla&s;ting Arms!</HI> P&s;al. xciii. 2. <HI>Thy Throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed of Old, thou art from Everla&s;ting.</HI> And hence the People of God are &s;aid <HI>to be cho&s;en before the Foundation of the World.</HI> And Rea&s;on al&s;o confirms the &s;ame Truth, as follows, 1&s;t. If God created all Things in the Beginning of Time, than he him&s;elf was before it, and &s;o by con&s;equence from Eternity. Time being in its Nature a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Dura|tion, taking its ri&s;e from a certain Point or Moment, which is termed a <HI>Beginning:</HI> The Duration which was before it mu&s;t be Eternal, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e Time to begin before it did begin, which is a Contradiction. But God did create all Things in the Beginning, as both Scripture and Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ure us, Ergo.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Eternity of God may be inferr'd from the Per|fection of his Nature. His Duration is Perfect, and there|fore
<PB N="127" REF="005500_0130_10396539F0D05298">
Infinite; for to begin to exi&s;t is an Imperfection, on which Account Creatures are &s;aid <HI>to be but of Ye&s;terday,</HI> which is a diminutive Character. If God was not from E|ternity, what he is, he would not be God, becau&s;e God is a mo&s;t perfect Being, <HI>i. e.</HI> who has all Perfection which is or can be: Now that which is de&s;titute of Exi&s;tence, is de&s;titute of all that Perfection which is in Exi&s;tence; yea he would be di&s;titute of E&s;&s;ence al&s;o, for E&s;&s;ence and Ex|i&s;tence are in God one and the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. If God was not from Eternity then Nothing would exi&s;t. For if the Fir&s;t does not exi&s;t, a Second or a Third cannot, as appears from the Subordination of Cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. If God was not from Eternity, there was a Time when he was not, and than he would not be now. For either he mu&s;t produce him&s;elf before he was, and &s;o be and not be at the &s;ame Time, or be produc'd by another, who by Con&s;equence mu&s;t be before the Fir&s;t; both which are equally ab&s;urd: For it is e&s;&s;ential to God to be ab&s;olutely the fir&s;t Being and Self-exi&s;tent.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Seeing that the Almighty gave Being to all Crea|tures, which is imply'd in their being &s;uch, it will nece&s;&s;arily follow, that he could not receive his Being from them, and &s;o mu&s;t needs be from Eternity. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. As the Duration of God is from Eternity, &s;o it is without Succe&s;&s;ion. Years and Days cannot properly be a&s;crib'd to him, no Times have pa&s;&s;ed over him, he enjoys him&s;elf in an everla&s;ting now! It cannot be properly &s;aid, <HI>he was,</HI> but <HI>that he is,</HI> and hence is his Name I AM. <HI>One Day is therefore with him as a Thou&s;and Years, and a Thou|&s;and Years as one Day.</HI> There can be no Succe&s;&s;ion in the Duration of the Almighty, for the following Rea&s;ons,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Becau&s;e it is Infinite. Now what is Infinite cannot
<PB N="128" REF="005500_0131_10396537E4858C60">
be mea&s;ured by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Parts and Periods, for it has none.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Duration of God is unchangeable, and there|fore it hath no Succe&s;&s;ion. This the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> confirms P&s;al. cii. 27. <HI>Thou art the &s;ame and thy Years &s;hall have no End.</HI> Now that which hath Succe&s;&s;ion, is not the &s;ame, for every Moment adds &s;omething to it which it had not be|fore.</P>
<P>But 3dly, As the Almighty has no <HI>beginning</HI> or <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> in Duration, thus he is likewi&s;e without <HI>End.</HI> Hence it is &s;aid, that <HI>he liveth for ever and ever, and that his Years &s;hall have no End, Rev.</HI> iv. 9, 10. <HI>P&s;a.</HI> cii. 27. The fol|lowing Arguments tend to e&s;tabli&s;h this Truth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. God is a mo&s;t &s;imple Being, void of all Compo&s;i|tion, and therefore can never have an End from any nece&s;|&s;ity of Nature, there being no Tendency therein, to a Di|&s;olution. It is true, compounded Beings becau&s;e of their va|rious Parts, are liable to a Di&s;olution, which ari&s;es from the contrariety of tho&s;e Parts of which they are con&s;tituted, which tends to de&s;troy each other, and &s;o to di&s;&s;olve the Compound; but the Almighty hath no Parts.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The <HI>Self-Exi&s;tence of God,</HI> which has been before prov'd, &s;hews that as he could not begin to be, &s;o neither can he cea&s;e to be. For as <HI>Johovah</HI> has deriv'd his Being from none, &s;o he depends upon none for its continuance. And &s;eeing all Creatures owe their original to him, he has no equal, much le&s;s &s;uperior, who can deprive him of his Exi&s;tence!</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Neither can the Almighty De&s;ire or Will his own De&s;truction, for that is contrary to the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things. No wi&s;e Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of compleat Happine&s;s, can Will the lo&s;s thereof, becau&s;e Happine&s;s is the proper Object of de&s;ire! Now a Di&s;truction of the Being, would ne|ce&s;&s;arily
<PB N="129" REF="005500_0132_1039653662A8E108">
de&s;troy the Happine&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by it; and therefore it cannot be de&s;ired by God. Well then, if the Almighty cannot cea&s;e to be from any nece&s;&s;ity of Nature, or by the Will of another, or by any Act of his own, he mu&s;t needs exi&s;t to Eternity. And</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Eternity is peculiar to God: Tho' &s;ome Creatures be Everla&s;ting, as Angels and the Souls of Men, yet they had a Beginning, have Succe&s;&s;ion in their Duration, and depend for its Continuance upon the Power and Will of God! and therefore their Duration is not nece&s;&s;ary and independant. Whereas on the Contrary the Duration of God, as has been ob&s;erv'd had no Beginning, has no Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, and neither &s;hall have, nor can have an End.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e Contraries &s;erve to illu&s;trate each other, let me ob&s;erve &s;omewhat concerning the <HI>Nature of Time:</HI> This is as &s;ome ob&s;erve, the mea&s;ure of the Creatures Du|ration. It has no di&s;tinct Being of its own, but is an Adjunct or Quality that belongs to Creatures, which has the&s;e three ingredients in it, namely, 1&s;t. <HI>A Beginning;</HI> that which once was not, mu&s;t needs begin to be, if it exi&s;ts at all: Thus at the Creation of the World, we read of the Begin|ing of Time, which &s;hews that Creatures are the Off|&s;pring of it, and mea&s;ured by it. Time gives date to their Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Time hath Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> it is not all at once, but flows by Degrees, it &s;tands not, but is &s;till in Motion, it con&s;i&s;ts of divers Parts or Moments, which are in a continual Flux, &s;ucceeding each other con&s;tantly, by the&s;e we calculate the Space or Term of a Creatures Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>Time hath</HI> al&s;o an <HI>End</HI> or <HI>Period,</HI> and this is re&s;pect|ing the Creature, when it cea&s;es to be. The afore&s;aid Par|ticulars give Room for our di&s;tingui&s;hing Time into that which is pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come. <HI>Time pa&s;t</HI> is all the Space
<PB N="130" REF="005500_0133_10396534DFDA4FE8">
or Duration, which the Creature has run thro' from its fir&s;t Exi&s;tence to the pre&s;ent Point or Minute. <HI>Time pre&s;ent</HI> is the Moment of Exi&s;tence, which is now in being. <HI>Time to come,</HI> is that which remains of the Creatures appointed Du|ration, until it expires. Now it's impo&s;&s;ible to make tho&s;e different Periods of Time to &s;ub&s;i&s;t at once. Whereas on the contrary <HI>Eternity,</HI> as has been ob&s;erv'd, is <HI>a per|petual Now,</HI> having no <HI>Beginning, Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P>That we may have &s;ome Idea of the Eternity of God, it will not be improper to repre&s;ent to our&s;elves, certain temporal Spaces, and by tho&s;e to compa&s;s the divine Dura|tion, as we cannot conceive of the divine Immen&s;ity or Omnipre&s;ence, without the Spaces of Place, &s;o neither can we conceive of his Eternity without the Spaces of Time, but we &s;hould be cautious in the mean Time, that we do not conceive the&s;e different Spaces to be real Beings, otherwi&s;e we &s;hall conceive of many Eternals. And 2dly. That as in the Spaces of Place, we admit not of <HI>Extention,</HI> or of the <HI>Di|men&s;ions</HI> of Length and Breadth, &s;o in the Spaces of Time, we admit not of Succe&s;&s;ion, or a Flux of Moments.</P>
<P>The Schoolmen truly de&s;cribe <HI>Eternity,</HI> <Q>to be an inter|minable, indivi&s;ible, <HI>and</HI> independent Duration.</Q> It is <HI>in|terminable,</HI> becau&s;e it wants Beginning and End. <HI>Indivi&s;ible,</HI> becau&s;e it has <HI>no Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Moments. Independent,</HI> be|cau&s;e it has no Imperfection or Change, nor any Po&s;&s;ibili|ty thereof.</P>
<P>It is certain that the Almighty exi&s;ts with all the Periods of Time, <HI>viz.</HI> pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and future, immoveable and un|mov'd, which the Antients did in &s;ome &s;ort &s;hadow forth by a Circle, who&s;e Center remain'd unmov'd, notwith&s;tand|ing of various Agitations in the Circumference. And the following Similitude may be u&s;ed to the &s;ame End, <HI>viz.</HI> Of a Man &s;itting by the Bank of a River, he &s;ees only the

Water that is pre&s;ent, not that which is pa&s;t, or that which is to come, but when he is lifted up on high, he &s;ees the whole River in its Spring, and Cour&s;e, and Outlet, and it is pre&s;ent with him. Hence it appears, that in God there is nothing pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, or to come, for the&s;e are but the A&s;pects of Time, upon Creatures. Eternity admits of no Divi&s;ions, all Things are pre&s;ent before God at once. Things move in re&s;pect of them&s;elves, but not in re&s;pect of God: He &s;ees them all at once, both pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and to come. And tho' he is before, and in, and after all Time, for he has made it, yet it cau&s;es no Alteration in him, be|cau&s;e he is no Subject of Time, and has no Dependance upon it. And for this Rea&s;on God cannot wax old, Time has no Relation to him, it cannot be the Mea&s;ure of his Ex|i&s;tence, becau&s;e it is Eternal. And therefore when in Scrip+ture, he is called <HI>the Antient of Days,</HI> it is only after the Manner of Men, to &s;uit the Weakne&s;s of our Conception, which cannot form an Idea of Eternity, but under the Notion of an Infinite Space of Time.</P>
<P>But the noble&s;t Creatures, even the Angels, had a Begin|ning, <HI>once they were not.</HI> They have likewi&s;e a <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> being finite, they cannot po&s;&s;ibly po&s;&s;e&s;s an Eternal now: And therefore their Duration mu&s;t be progre&s;&s;ive. And tho' they have no Tendency to Mortality in their Natures, yet are they dependant on their Creators Plea&s;ure, who can &s;peak them to nothing by the Word of his Power in a Moment. But an Objection may be offer'd again&s;t what has been be|fore a&s;&s;erted, namely this, <HI>is not the Creation of the World pa&s;t, with God, when he made it in Six Days.</HI> An&s;. God's Acts are Two-Fold. 1&s;t. <HI>Immanent</HI> terminated in him&s;elf. (<HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> i. 9.)

<P N="1">1&s;t. The Scripture proves this many Ways, 1&s;t. By re|moving all Shadow of <HI>Change</HI> from God. <HI>Jam.</HI> i. 17. <HI>with whom there is no</HI> Change <HI>or Shadow of turning.</HI> The Origi|nal Words <HI>(parallage &amp; tropes apo&s;cia&s;ma)</HI> here us'd, are a Metaphor borrow'd from the Sun, which as A&s;tronomers &s;ay, has its Paralaxes or various A&s;pects.

<P N="2">2dly. Sometimes the Scriptures remove from God tho&s;e Things that imply a Change. <HI>e. g. Repentance</HI> Num. xxiii. 19. <HI>God is not a Man that he &s;hould lie, neither the Son of Man that he &s;hould repent.</HI> 1 Sam. xv. 29. <HI>And al&s;o the Strength of I&s;rael will not lie, nor repent, for he is not a Man that he &s;hould repent.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. Sometimes it <HI>a&s;&s;erts</HI> his <HI>immutability</HI> expre&s;ly, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> cii. 27. <HI>But thou art the &s;ame, and thy Years &s;hall have no End.</HI> Some of the antient <HI>Fathers</HI> have &s;poken well upon this Head, particularly the&s;e following <HI>viz. Proclus</HI> in a Sermon concerning Faith &s;ayeth,
<Q>That the Deity remains Superior to all Mutability. Change is a Pa&s;&s;ion of a fluent Nature, but Immutability is proper to an Eternal Nature that is always the &s;ame.</Q>
<HI>Hillarie</HI> in his Book concern|ing the Trinity &s;ays <Q>I think not that God is changeable. Nei|ther Vice, Amendment, Progre&s;s, or Lo&s;s, happens to the Eter|nal,

but what he is he always is.</Q>
<HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> in the Preface of his fourth Book concerning the Trinity &s;ayeth,
<Q>that the divine E&s;&s;ence, hath nothing mutable, either in his <HI>Eter|nity, Verity</HI> or <HI>Will.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And right Rea&s;on likewi&s;e gives its &s;uffrage to the im|mutability of God, as appears by the following Con&s;iderati|ons, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. God is a mo&s;t &s;imple Being, and therefore cannot be chang'd: For Change, being an altering Vici&s;&s;itude, would de&s;troy his Being intirely, when that which is mo&s;t &s;imple is changed, nothing remains of what it was before, and thus it is de&s;troy'd entirely. Thus you &s;ee, it is Athei&s;m to a&s;cribe Change to the Almighty.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. God is a mo&s;t perfect, yea infinitely perfect Being, and therefore cannot be chang'd, becau&s;e to that which is perfect, no Good can be added. If God be chang'd, it mu&s;t be either into a wor&s;e or better State, or into a Condition equal to what he was before. But he can't be chang'd in|to a wor&s;e State, for then he would be imperfect after the Change, and &s;o no God. Nor into a better, for then he would be imperfect before the Change &amp; &s;o no God. Nor can he pa&s;s into an equal State to what he was before, for this implies an equal Proportion of Lo&s;s and Gain, and thus there would be more infinitely perfect Beings than one, and &s;o more Gods, which is impo&s;&s;ible, and bla&s;phemous to imagine.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Seeing the Almighty is ab&s;olutely the fir&s;t Being, he cannot be changed, for what&s;oever is chang'd, is chang'd by one prior to it&s;elf, but this in re&s;pect of God is impo&s;&s;ible, for none can be before the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Seeing the Almighty is incorruptible, he cannot be chang'd: For what is a Change of the be&s;t Being, el&s;e but a Corruption of it?</P>
<P N="5">5thly. God is infinite and therefore cannot be changed by adding any Thing to him or dimini&s;hing any Thing from
<PB N="137" REF="005500_0140_10396528C138E978">
him; for if he were capable of Addition, he mu&s;t be finite before the Change; and if of Diminution, he mu&s;t be finite after it, and &s;o neither Ways the true God. For as Infinity is an e&s;&s;ential Character of God, &s;o this is incapa|ble of more or le&s;s: For then there wou'd be an Infinite which was more than Infinite, and &s;o an Infinite which is not Infinite; which is ridiculous! But I proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">2d. Propo&s;ed, which was to <HI>explain the Nature of God's Immutability.</HI> And here it may be ob&s;erv'd, that God's <HI>im|mutability</HI> may be thus de&s;crib'd, viz. <HI>That it is an e&s;&s;ential Perfection of the divine Nature, whereby the Almighty is without all po&s;&s;ibility of any Kind of Change.</HI> In order to explain this Di&s;cription, let the following particulars be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That when we call God's immutability a <HI>Perfection,</HI> we &s;uppo&s;e his Goodne&s;s and Excellency, otherwi&s;e it would be no Perfection; but the Contrary to be immutable in Sin and Mi&s;ery is the highe&s;t pitch of both, which is the dole|ful Ca&s;e of damned Angels and damned Souls!</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Immutability,</HI> in &s;trict propriety, belongs only to God. Hence it is &s;aid, <HI>that he only hath Immortality,</HI> 1. Tim vi. 16. His <HI>immutability</HI> is underiv'd and independent, whereas the <HI>immutability</HI> of all Creatures is dependent be|cau&s;e deriv'd. It is borrow'd from the Power and meer Plea&s;ure of God, and therefore, its Duration is entirely and perpetually Subject thereto! The vi&s;ible Heavens of all in|animate Beings &s;eem to be the mo&s;t free from Corruption, and even the&s;e are lyable to it. P&s;al cii. 25.26. <HI>Of Old thou thou ha&s;t laid the Foundations of the Earth and the Heavens are the Work of thy Hands, they &s;hall peri&s;h, but thou &s;halt endure, yea all of them &s;hall wax old as a Garment.</HI> Yea the mo&s;t noble Creatures in Heaven it &s;elf are &s;ubject to change; the Angels are capable of new Additions to their
<PB N="138" REF="005500_0141_103965271B64AA30">
Happine&s;s, for new Object may be offer'd to incite their Prai&s;e, and this tends to increa&s;e their Felicity. The Angels doubtle&s;s know more now concerning the My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel, than before the Incarnation of our Saviour; hence they are &s;aid <HI>to know,</HI> by the Church, <HI>the manifold Wi&s;dom of God,</HI> Eph. iii. 10. and <HI>to de&s;ire to look into the&s;e Things,</HI> 1 Pet. i. 11, 12. The Happine&s;s of all Creatures admits of Degrees, and &s;o of Change, becau&s;e they are finite: But God is Infinite and &s;o peculiarly <HI>immutable!</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. Creatures may be chang'd two Ways, either 1&s;t. <HI>Outwardly,</HI> in re&s;pect of Time and Place: Things that are the Off-&s;pring of Time, are &s;ubject to it and changed by it <HI>outwardly,</HI> they grow older: They are likewi&s;e chang'd <HI>outwardly</HI> when they move from Place to Place. 2dly. Crea|ture are likewi&s;e liable to change in re&s;pect of their <HI>Being</HI> and <HI>Faculties;</HI> but the Almighty is capable of neither of the&s;e nor any other Change, as will appear by the following Induction of particulars. And 1&s;t. The Almighty is not chang'd in re&s;pect of <HI>Place,</HI> becau&s;e he is Immen&s;e and In|finite, and cannot be mea&s;ured by Space. Nor 2dly. In re|&s;pect of <HI>Time,</HI> becau&s;e he is Eternal, and &s;o no &s;ubject of Time, as has been before ob&s;erv'd. Nor 3dly. Can the Al|mighty be chang'd in re&s;pect of <HI>Accidents,</HI> becau&s;e they are not applicable to him, on account of the Simplicity of his Being. Hence every Thing that is in God is him&s;elf, he is <HI>true, ju&s;t, wi&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. by his <HI>E&s;&s;ence.</HI> Neither</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Can the Almighty be chang'd in re&s;pect of his <HI>E&s;&s;ence.</HI> For this &s;uppos'd Change mu&s;t be either effected by him&s;elf or another: not by him&s;elf, becau&s;e there is no tendency in his Nature to a Change, it being void of all Compo&s;ition! Neither can it be rea&s;onably &s;uppos'd that an infinitely Wi&s;e and perfectly Happy Being would Will a Change in his own Happine&s;s, &s;eeing there is no Nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="139" REF="005500_0142_103965259869DCD8">
for &s;uch a change, were it po&s;&s;ible. Neither can another change the divine <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> &s;eeing that all are inferior to God; for he that changes another mu&s;t be &s;upe|rior to him whom he changes. Nor 5thly. Is the Almighty chang'd in his <HI>Perfections</HI> or <HI>Faculties</HI> which are indeed in him the &s;ame with his <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> altho' in our manner of con|ceiving of them they are di&s;tingui&s;h'd, to which God is plea&s;ed to accommodate him&s;elf in his Word, by a&s;&s;uming to him&s;elf an <HI>Under&s;tanding, Will, Affections,</HI> all which be|ing him&s;elf are by con&s;equence <HI>immutable.</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. God is <HI>Immutable</HI> in his <HI>Under&s;tanding.</HI> A Change of Sentiments implies Weakne&s;s; to increa&s;e in Knowledge &s;uppo&s;es Ignorance, and to decline in Knowledge is to re|turn to a &s;tate of Ignorance, both which are equally incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Perfection of the divine Mind!</P>
<P>The Knowledge of God is not deriv'd from outward Ob|jects, as that of Creatures is, and &s;o is not dependent on them, and by con&s;equence not altered by their Changes.</P>
<P>Again, the Knowledge of Creatures is &s;omething di&s;tinct, from the Faculty receiving, and &s;o may be increas'd or di|mini&s;h'd: But in God it is him&s;elf or his Being, it is no o|ther than God knowing: And therefore if this were changed, the Being of God mu&s;t be chang'd al&s;o, which is im|po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The &s;acred Scriptures a&s;&s;ure us, <HI>that God's Under&s;tanding is Infinite,</HI> P&s;al. cxlvii. 5. And if &s;o, it mu&s;t be unchang|able, for what is Infinite admits of no degrees. More it cannot be, for Nothing can be greater than Infinite; nor le&s;s, for than it would not be Infinite. God knows all Things in Eternity in him&s;elf with one glance. Hence he is call'd <HI>the only wi&s;e God,</HI> 1 Tim. i. 17. and that <HI>all his Works are known to him from the beginning of the World,</HI> Act. xv. 18.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="140" REF="005500_0143_10396523F0AD6530">2dly. God is <HI>unchangeable</HI> in his <HI>Will,</HI> altho' his Will is free, it is neverthele&s;s Con&s;tant and Eternal. <HI>He is in one Mind and who can turn him,</HI> &s;ayeth <HI>Job</HI> Chap. 23.13. and el&s;e|where, <HI>tho' there be many devi&s;es in Man's Heart, yet the Council of the Lord that &s;hall &s;tand.</HI> Now the Truth of this will farther appear, if we con&s;ider the following Particu|lars, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. If the <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Purpo&s;e</HI> of God were chang|able, than the State of the be&s;t Men would be render'd ex|ceeding precarious and mi&s;erable; for then the &s;pecial Gifts of God vouch&s;afed at one Time, might be remov'd at a|nother, and then the Condition of the mo&s;t Devout would be as perilous as that of Rope-Dancers, who are every Mo|ment in danger of breaking their Necks. But the &s;acred. Scriptures a&s;&s;ure us, <HI>that the Gifts and Calling of God are without Repentance,</HI> Rom. xi. 29. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. If the Will of God were not <HI>unchangable,</HI> than he would neither be the Object of Tru&s;t or Fear; for then, from the mutability of his Nature, both his Promi&s;es and Threats might be revers'd, and &s;o the former would not merit our Confidence, nor the latter our Dread! And thus Hope and Fear, the great Springs of Religion, would be de|&s;troy'd.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Ina&s;much as the <HI>Will of God</HI> is really him&s;elf, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed from his <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> only in our Conception, (modaly) then if his <HI>Will</HI> was changed, it would follow nece&s;&s;arily, that him&s;elf was chang'd, which cannot be, for the Rea&s;ons before mention'd. And,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Seeing that the Almighty <HI>Wills</HI> and <HI>Purpo&s;es</HI> with infinite Wi&s;dom and Council, upon a &s;ure and unalterable Foundation, what&s;oever &s;hall come to pa&s;s, it cannot be that his Will &s;hould Change. But to make this more Plain and Evident, let me offer the following induction of Particulars
<PB N="141" REF="005500_0144_103965224BACEC10">
to prove that none of tho&s;e Things that induce Men to change their Purpo&s;es, can be apply'd to God. And,</P>

Sometimes Men are <HI>compell'd</HI> to change their Purpo|&s;es by the Threats of Superiors, or by &s;ome other mea|&s;ure of coertion: But none is God's equal, much le&s;s his &s;uperior, and therefore no con&s;traint can be laid upon him! I&s;a. xiv. 27. <HI>For the Lord of Ho&s;ts hath purpo&s;ed and who &s;hall di&s;anul it? And his Hand is &s;tretched out, and who &s;hall turn it back?</HI> P&s;al. cxv. 3. <HI>But our God is in the Heavens, he hath done what&s;oever he plea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly, Sometimes Men change their Purpo&s;es for want of Power to compa&s;s them, this has rendered many well con|certed Schemes abortive! But the De&s;igns of God cannot be mar'd thro' Impotency, becau&s;e he is infinite in Strength.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Men &s;ometimes alter their Purpo&s;es, becau&s;e &s;ome|thing unfore&s;een and unexpected happens, which gives &s;uch a turn to the Scene of Affairs, as makes an Alteration ne|ce&s;&s;ary. But to a&s;cribe this to God, is to de&s;troy his Hap|pine&s;s and the infinity of his Knowledge; and &s;o by Con|&s;equence to deny him to be God.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Men change their Purpo&s;es &s;ometimes through a natural Ficklene&s;s and In&s;tability, which makes them in a little &s;pace of Time for and again&s;t a Thing, and proceeds partly from Ignorance, and partly from the moveablene&s;s of their Affections; none of which can de a&s;crib'd to God, he being <HI>immutable</HI> in his Nature, mu&s;t be &s;o al&s;o in his Purpo&s;e or Will.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Men change their Purpo&s;es in promi&s;ing, and not fulfilling what they promi&s;e, from the Corruption of their Nature: But God is invioably Holy, and therefore cannot Change in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. Men &s;ometimes change their Purpo&s;es becau&s;e they were ra&s;hly made, without a thorough Knowledge of Things
<PB N="142" REF="005500_0145_1039652048212570">
and due Con&s;ideration upon them: But neither of the&s;e can be a&s;crib'd to God, <HI>for as he is Infinite in Knowledge, &s;o he Works all Things after the Council of his Will,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, Eph. i. 11. But I proceed to the</P>
<P N="3">3. Propos'd, which was to <HI>an&s;wer &s;ome Objections.</HI> And 1&s;t. The <HI>Pelagians, Semipelagians, Je&s;uits, Arminians</HI> and <HI>Remon&s;trants,</HI> object, <HI>That by the afore&s;aid</HI> Immutability <HI>our</HI> Free-Will <HI>would be de&s;troy'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> No! By no Means, becau&s;e the freedom of our Will con&s;i&s;ts in a freedom from Force or Co-action, and fa|culty of acting by Council or with rational Complacency, and not in any independent indifferency to contraries, which is not hurt by the <HI>Immutability</HI> of God, but rather e&s;tabli&s;hed. For God has purpo&s;ed that every Agent &s;hall act according to his Kind. Natural Agents nece&s;&s;arily <HI>(ad ultimum &s;ui po&s;&s;e)</HI> to the extent of their Power; thus Fire burns, and Water wets as much as they can. And rational Agents, voluntarily or freely. If Liberty con&s;i&s;ted in indifferency to contraries, then God him&s;elf, Angels and glorified Saints, would be depriv'd of it, for they have an eternal contrariety to Sin, and an eternal propen&s;ity to Holine&s;s! And to &s;uppo&s;e Creatures independent in Willing or Acting, is to &s;uppo&s;e them to be Gods, becau&s;e then they would not be under the Government of the Almighty. A Creature may as well exi&s;t of it&s;elf as act of it&s;elf. Second Cau&s;es mu&s;t needs depend on the fir&s;t in Being and Acting, for <HI>in him we live, move and have our Being.</HI> And as Divines ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, <HI>(operari Sequitur e&s;&s;e) Action follows the Kind of the Being it proceeds from.</HI> Independent Action follows an indepen|dent Being; and dependent Action, a dependent one, other|wi&s;e the Effect would exceed the Vertue of the producing Cau&s;e, which is ab&s;urd! A</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="143" REF="005500_0146_1039651E65E64540">2d. Objection is this, <HI>That by the afore&s;aid</HI> Immutability, <HI>God him&s;elf would not have a free Will, becau&s;e according to it, he could not alter a conceiv'd Re&s;olve.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> God Almighty Wills, what he Wills, of rational Complacency, and therefore Wills it freely. He acts accord|ing to his Nature, and therefore freely. To &s;uppo&s;e that God can't Act freely without cro&s;&s;ing his Nature, is to de&s;troy the Happine&s;s and Simplicity of God, and &s;o by con&s;equence his very Being, and to a&s;&s;ert, that Liberty con&s;i&s;ts in con|&s;traint, which is a Contradiction. A</P>
<P N="3">3d. Objection is, <HI>God threatens &s;ome Things which come not to pa&s;s, as in the Ca&s;es of</HI> Hezekiah <HI>and</HI> Nineveh, (2. <HI>Kings</HI> xx. i. <HI>Jonah</HI> iii. 4.)</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> God di&s;pen&s;eth his ab&s;olute Purpo&s;es to his Creatures by conditional Promi&s;es and Threatnings; and tho' the Con|ditions of Faith and Repentance be not always expre&s;&s;ed, yet they are imply'd. Jer. xviii. 7, 8. <HI>If I &s;peak concerning a Nation to de&s;troy it, if that Nation again&s;t whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will Repent of the Evil I tho't to do unto them.</HI></P>
<P>Objection 4. <HI>God is &s;aid to repent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It's el&s;e where &s;aid, <HI>that he is not a Man that he &s;hould repent,</HI> i. e. He can't repent as Men do by chang|ing his Purpo&s;e, and in being &s;orry for what he has done. All that looks like Repentance in God, is an Alteration of the Cour&s;e of his Providence towards his Creatures, and this is a change of the Work, not of the Workman, and its only on this Account that Repentance is a&s;crib'd to God.</P>
<P>Objection 5. <HI>God Wills and makes mutable Things.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> He does &s;o, but after an immutable Manner, even as by his Eternity, which is de&s;titute of all Succe&s;&s;ion, he directs &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and mutable Things. Its true the Revela|tion
<PB N="144" REF="005500_0147_1039651CE3F7BF98">
of God's Will may be changed, whereby that may be rendered a Duty at one Time which is not at another, as appears from the <HI>Ceremonial Law:</HI> But the&s;e Changes be|ing before determined by God, make no Alteration in his Will, as <HI>Aquinas</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>It's one Thing to change the Will and another to Will a Change.</Q> As St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> &s;ayeth, <Q>The Change is in us, not in God, as Hou&s;es and Trees &s;eem to move to tho&s;e that are in a Ship, but the Ship moves and they &s;tand firm.</Q></P>
<P>Objection 6. <HI>The &s;econd Per&s;on of the Trinity was made Man in Time, which he was not before, and &s;o was chang'd.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer with <HI>Wendeline,</HI>
<Q>He a&s;&s;umed the human Nature, but was not changed into it, and this was but ac|cording to an Act of his Will from Eternity, and therefore he was not chang'd, for all po&s;itive change is by &s;uffering.</Q></P>
<P>Objection 7. <HI>God is &s;aid to &s;uffer Death.</HI> Act. xx. 28.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> He did &s;uffer it, but not in him&s;elf, but in the a&s;|&s;umed human Nature, and &s;o is not chang'd.</P>
<P>Objection 8. <HI>God created the World in Time, which he did not from Eternity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> He did &s;o, but by that Power which is Eternal and Immutable. Creation is nothing el&s;e but an Act of God's Will from Eternity that the World &s;hould exi&s;t in Time. Here the Creature is altered, but not the Will of God. Neither does any Thing accrue to God by the Crea|tion but a meer Relation, which infers no change in him!</P>
<P>Object. 9. <HI>What God Wills is not always done.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Yes, what he Wills is done, but in the Manner he Wills. If he Wills only by commanding that the Thing Commanded be our Duty, then that is done: If he Wills by decreeing that any Thing &s;hould exi&s;t, then it does exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Object. 10. <HI>God loves &s;ome Men whom he before hated,</HI> viz. <HI>the Elect that are called, and therefore he is changed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="005500_0148_1039651B6004B760"><HI>An&s;.</HI> Rational Affections are but Acts of the Will or its Po&s;tures to an Object, and the&s;e are ever the &s;ame in God. Love or Hatred, as they are Pa&s;&s;ions, can't be properly a&s;crib'd to God, for &s;uch would de&s;troy his Happine&s;s, Sim|plicity and Perfection, and therefore they intend no more but his Purpo&s;e to confer Benefits upon his Creatures in Time, or to puni&s;h them together with the Execution thereof, which is no more than an Act of his Will from Eternity, together with his Providence pur&s;uant thereto in Time: Or they intend that Per&s;ons who were before expo&s;ed to the Cur&s;e of the Law, are now according to God's eternal Purpo&s;e delivered therefrom, which makes a Change in the Creatures State but not in God.</P>
<P>Object. 11. <HI>The Scriptures repre&s;ent the Almighty as hav|ing Complacency in his People.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Its true; but this &s;hews only the Creatures confor|mity to God's Nature, and therefore &s;ignifies a Change in it, but not in him. The Sun which was trouble&s;ome to &s;ore Eyes, is plea&s;ant to them, being heal'd: Here the Sun is not chang'd, but the Eyes.</P>
<P>Object. 12. <HI>If God be immutable, then what &s;ignifies Prayer, or the U&s;e of any other Means?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The De&s;ign of <HI>Prayer,</HI> is not to move God, but our &s;elves, to expre&s;s our Allegiance to him, and get Pre|paration for the Mercies he offers. Moreover it may be ob&s;erved, that Prayer is a mean in the U&s;e of which God is wont to confer Mercy. Now he immutably Wills the Mean, as well as the End. But I proceed to the Improve|ment. Now from what has been &s;aid, we may learn, 1&s;t. The <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Emptine&s;s</HI> of all Creatures, God alone is immutable, every thing under the Sun be&s;ides him, is frail and fleeting, and hath no abiding! The World is a roling Wheel, and every thing in it, is &s;ubject to change and mu|tation;
<PB N="146" REF="005500_0149_103965199C0971C8">
yea even tho&s;e Things, that &s;eem mo&s;t Specious and Stable, are in a continual Whirle-pool of Change, <HI>viz.</HI> Nobles, Princes, Kings common Wealths, Kingdoms and Empires: Both Scripture and Hi&s;tory inform us, of the Cata&s;trophes, or De&s;olations, every of tho&s;e is Subject to! Riches make to them&s;elves Wings oftentimes and fly away; Honour is but an in&s;table bla&s;t, often times conferr'd with as little Judgment as it is remov'd; and Plea&s;ure has no &s;tability: As for the Love of Friends, it often changes with the Wind: How fooli&s;h is it therefore to over love or con|fide in &s;uch changeing Shadows of Good? God is the only Object worthy of our Love and Confidence! Let us there|fore <HI>u&s;e the&s;e Things as tho' we u&s;ed them not,</HI> with due Weanedne&s;s and Moderation, and acquie&s;s in the immutable God only. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Hence we learn the great ground of the <HI>Saints Per&s;eve|rance.</HI> Is it any Thing in them, or any Thing re&s;olved or done by them? No, they are but Creatures, their Grace might fail, as appears from the fall of the Angels, and of our fir&s;t Parents, and their Re&s;olutions might alter; but the immutability of God cannot. And this is the Ground of the Saints Per&s;everance. <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.6. <HI>I am the Lord: I change not, therefore the Sons of</HI> Jacob <HI>are not con&s;umed.</HI> God has fix'd his everla&s;ting Love upon them, he has made an everla&s;ting Covenant with them, and given his unchangeable Promi&s;e to them, <HI>that he will never leave them,</HI> and will he, can he go back, and &s;uffer his Faithfulne&s;s to fail? No, its impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Hence we may learn, the awful Ca&s;e of the fi|nally impenitent. That God is unchangable, who hath threatned to cur&s;e and de&s;troy them, and this they mu&s;t everla&s;tingly endure. After the Day of his Mercy expires, he will be inexorable to all the Cries and Importunities of the Wicked; their dreadful Doom &s;hall never be rever&s;ed; their intolerable and inexpre&s;&s;ible Plagues, &s;hall be immuta|ble

and eternal!

O, &s;hould not the&s;e &s;olemn Con&s;iderations frighten Impenitents from Sin and Security, to God and Goodne&s;s!</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Hence we learn al&s;o the great Ground Believers have to tru&s;t and rejoyce in God in every Immergent. God is the only Object worthy of our Tru&s;t, for he always remains the &s;ame, and will never fail them. He is the im|moveable Rock, the un&s;haken Foundation upon which his Church is Built; again&s;t which the Gates of Hell &s;hall ne|ver prevail. When we are perplex'd with a Sight and Sen&s;e of our own Treachery and Weakne&s;s, compar'd with the Strength and Policy of our Enemies, or with a view of the many Vici&s;&s;itudes, Wars, Confu&s;ions, Calamities, Di&s;|cea&s;es, and Deaths, which mankind are involv'd in and expos'd to. What is a &s;weeter Support than to think God is a Rock, who&s;e Foundation &s;tands &s;ure; <HI>the Lord knows who are his:</HI> That his &s;aving Gifts are without Repentance, and that <HI>Jehovah</HI> in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e Changes, will be unmov'd to his own, and pre&s;ent with them by his Strengh, that they may not be mov'd, that he will remain Immuta|ble in his Love and Grace, in his Purpo&s;e and Promi&s;es, which are &s;o many and &s;o great! And why then may we not with the pious Prophet triumphing &s;ay, <HI>Altho' the Fig Tree &s;hall not Blo&s;om, neither &s;hall fruit be in the Vines, the Labour of the Olive &s;hall fail, And the Field &s;hall yield no Meat, the Flock &s;hall be cut off from the Fold, and there &s;hall be no Herd in the Stalls; yet I will rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my Salvation!</HI> What tho' all beneath the Sun, were in a tumultuous Uproar: Our Rock <HI>Jehovah</HI> is unmov'd, and therefore let us tru&s;t and joy in him!</P>

<P>THESE Words are Part of our Lord's An&s;wer to the Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> concerning what &s;he had &s;aid re&s;pecting wor&s;hipping God upon a particular Mountain, by which our Saviour informs her, and us by her, that the Ceremonial and Typical Sanctity or Ho|line&s;s of Places, which obtain'd under the Jewi&s;h Di&s;pen|&s;ation, is now under the New-Te&s;tament remov'd; and that &s;incere Service or Wor&s;hip, is accepted of by God every where, without any re&s;pect had to the Place where it is per|form'd.</P>
<P>Now the Text we are con&s;idering contains three Things, 1&s;t. A <HI>general De&s;cription of God,</HI> viz. that <HI>he is a Spirit.</HI> God is call'd a Spirit, 1&s;t. <HI>negatively,</HI> becau&s;e he is not a Body, 2dly. <HI>Analogically,</HI> <Q>becau&s;e there are many Excel|lency's in &s;piritual Sub&s;tances, which do more &s;hadow forth the Divine Nature, than any Bodily Thing can.</Q> As Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> ob&s;erves in his <HI>Medulla.</HI> 3dly. God is call'd a Spi|rit <HI>properly</HI> and <HI>eminently,</HI> ina&s;much as he is mo&s;t remote from all manner of Compo&s;ition. And altho' Angels and the Souls of Men, have a kind of Simplicity, yet the Al|mighty infinitely exceeds them therein: For what&s;oever is
<PB N="150" REF="005500_0153_1039651331569D80">
affirm'd of God, which is communicable to Creatures, the &s;ame mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be in him, in a more ex|cellent and &s;ingular Manner, and in an infinitely greater De|gree. The third Per&s;on of the Trinity is not only call'd a Spirit, <HI>hypo&s;tatically,</HI> and by Way of Apropriation, becau&s;e of his Proce&s;&s;ion from the Father and the Son by a cer|tain ineffable Breathing, but al&s;o every Per&s;on of the &s;acred Trinity, is call'd Spirit, <HI>e&s;&s;entially,</HI> becau&s;e they all have the &s;ame immaterial E&s;&s;ence.</P>

<P N="2">2dly Spirits are <HI>invi&s;ible Sub&s;tances,</HI> 1&s;t.

<P N="5">5thly.

<P N="6">6thly. Spirits are the mo&s;t <HI>nimble</HI> in their <HI>Motions,</HI> and <HI>unwearied</HI> in their Actings, of all created Beings. One of them is &s;aid fly from the third Heaven to the Earth in a few Hours (<HI>Dan.</HI> xxi. 22.)

<P N="7">7thly.

<P>But tho' there be &s;ome likene&s;s between God and the Crea|tures in &s;ome Things, yet it mu&s;t be &s;till remembred, that he infinitely tran&s;cends their noble&s;t Excellency's and in ma|ny Things is unlike them <HI>P&s;al.</HI> cxlviii. 13. <HI>Let them Prai&s;e the Name of the Lord, for his Name alone is excellent, and his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven.</HI> This leads to the</P>
<P N="3">3d. General Head which was to &s;hew the Di&s;&s;imulitude or Unlikene&s;s been God and created Spirits, even of the highe&s;t order, which appears in the following In&s;tances, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Excellencies of created Spirits are <HI>deriv'd</HI> from him to whom they owe their Beings, who is therefore &s;til'd the <HI>Father of Spirits, and the God of the Spirits of all Fle&s;h,</HI> Heb. xii. 9. But as the Almighty had no Beginning of Exi&s;tence, con&s;equently his Perfections mu&s;t be unde|riv'd and Eternal.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Excellencies of created Spirits, are but <HI>com|parative, viz.</HI> that they excell the be&s;t of material Beings in their Nature and Properties, whereas the Ble&s;&s;ed God ex|cells both material and immaterial.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Beings and Excellencies of created Spirits are <HI>limitted,</HI> their being Creatures proves them to be finite. He that made them mu&s;t needs give Bounds to their Beings,
<PB N="155" REF="005500_0158_1039650A9E8C01E0">
&s;o that they cannot fill all Places at once. And Infinite Excellency's cannot be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by any Thing that is in its Nature finite. But as the Being of God is &s;elf-exi&s;tent, and therefore unlimited, &s;o his Perfections are infinite.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The Excellencies of created Spirits are <HI>dependant</HI> &amp; alterable, becau&s;e deriv'd from another, they mu&s;t depend on him who form'd them. Angels them&s;elves, who are the noble&s;t of created Spirits, ina&s;much as they once were not, are capable of returning to their former Nonentity: They are al&s;o capable of the Impre&s;&s;ions of Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery; &s;ome of them have fallen from their original State of Holine&s;s &amp; Happine&s;s; but none of the&s;e Things are applica|ble to God, he is far from the Shadow of Change, an inde|pendant God. Who tho' he is happy, can neither be made happy or mi&s;erable. He only hath immortality.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Angels are <HI>under</HI> the <HI>Dominion</HI> of God, they mu&s;t needs owe Subjection and Homage to him, who gave them their Exi&s;tence. And this their very Name <HI>Angel</HI> or <HI>Me&s;|&s;enger</HI> imports. But it is the unalienable and incommuni|cable Prerogative of <HI>Jehovah</HI> alone to be &s;upream and above all Control.</P>
<P>But I proceed to the 4th general Head which was to open the Nature of that &s;piritual Wor&s;hip, which we ought to perform to that God, <HI>who is a Spirit,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It imply's <HI>&s;piritual Principles, viz. Experimental Knowledge</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and <HI>our Selves,</HI> &s;uch as affects and humbles us, and makes us judge our &s;elves, with holy <HI>Paul,</HI> to be <HI>le&s;s than the Lea&s;t of all Saints. Without Knowledge,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Solo|mon, the Mind cannot be good.</HI> And Indeed we cannot love rationally without &s;ome Knowledge of the Object we love.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Another <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>&s;piritual Wor&s;hip,</HI> is <HI>Love,</HI> tran&s;cendent Love to God in CHRIST, becau&s;e of his un|parallel'd and inexpre&s;&s;ible Excellency, whereby we choo&s;e
<PB N="156" REF="005500_0159_10396508D7E7D7B0">
God as the only Portion of our Souls, and his Wor&s;hip as our mo&s;t agreeable Entertainment. (<HI>Jo&s;.</HI> xxiv. 15.)</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Another Principle of <HI>&s;piritual Wor&s;hip</HI> is <HI>Faith</HI> in the eternal God, Father, Son and Spirit, even &s;uch <HI>Faith</HI> as renews the Heart, and reforms the Practice: For he that comes to God mu&s;t <HI>believe that he is, and that he is a Re|warder of tho&s;e that unfeignedly &s;eek him,</HI> But</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Spiritual Wor&s;hip</HI> implies a <HI>&s;piritual End,</HI> not our own Credit or worldly Intere&s;t, with the Phari&s;ees of Old; but God's Glory, and in Subordination thereto, our own and our Neighbours Spiritual Good and Edification. This is to &s;erve God with our Spirits, as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> expre&s;&s;es it (<HI>Rom.</HI> i. 9.) If we &s;hould refer all our natural and ci|cil Actions to the Glory of God, how much more our Reli|gious? <HI>Whether in eating or drinking, or what&s;oever we do we &s;hould do it all to the Glory of God.</HI> See <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 22, 23. <HI>Not with Eye Service, &s;uch as Men Plea&s;ers, but in &s;inglene&s;s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Heart fearing God. And what&s;oever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not unto Men.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>Spiritual Wor&s;hip,</HI> implies a <HI>&s;piritual Rule,</HI> not the Cu&s;toms of the Age we live in, or the Inventions or Tra|ditions of Men, but the written Word of God, this is &s;uffi|cient <HI>to make the Man of God Perfect, and thoroughly furni&s;hed to every good Work.</HI> To tho&s;e that walk according to this Rule, <HI>Peace be on them and on I&s;rael of God. To the Law and to the Te&s;timony, if they &s;peak not according to this Word, it is becau&s;e there is no Light in them.</HI> I&s;a. viii. 20. As God on|ly knows what Wor&s;hip will be acceptable to him, &s;o he only has a Right to pre&s;cribe Acts of Wor&s;hip, being the Creator and Lord of all, and therefore when Men add to the divine In&s;titutions, as they abridge their fellow Creatures of the Liberty God has graciou&s;ly given them, &s;o they u|&s;urp the divine Prerogative, and injuriou&s;ly reflect upon the

Wi&s;dom and Fidelity of the great Legi&s;lator. Our Lord charged the Phari&s;ees, with <HI>vain Wor&s;hip</HI> becau&s;e they taught for Doctrines <HI>the Commandments of Men.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. Spiritual Wor&s;hip, implies a <HI>&s;piritual Manner</HI> of <HI>Performance,</HI> And this is when the Heart joyns with the outward Man in God's Service, when we do it out of Choice. (<HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> vxiv. 15.) <HI>When we long for an ab&s;ent God, P&s;.</HI> xlii. 1. When we heartily lament his Ab&s;ence, with <HI>Job. O that I knew where I could find him!</HI> When we <HI>rejoyce</HI> in his Pre&s;ence! (<HI>Phil.</HI> iii. 3.) When under a Sen&s;e of our Inability to perform Duty aright, without the Help of the Spi|rit thro' CHRIST, and our Unworthine&s;s of that Help, we rely upon the Lord JESUS for Strength. Thus the Spou&s;e is &s;aid <HI>to come out of the Wilderne&s;s, leaning on her Beloved.</HI> But I proceed to the Improvement of this Subject. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. From the &s;pirituality of God, or from his Being a Spirit, we may infer his <HI>Simplicity.</HI> A Spirit, as all acknow|ledge, is an immaterial Being, and therefore a &s;imple one. If it be objected, that Angels and the Souls of Men are called Spirits in Scripture, and yet they are not altogether &s;imple. <HI>An&s;.</HI> They are &s;o only in a diminitive Sen&s;e, by Way of analogy, becau&s;e they come neare&s;t of all to the Spirituality of God. But God him&s;elf is mo&s;t properly &amp; per|fectly a Spirit. The Holy Scriptures teach this <HI>Simplicity</HI> of God, &s;o often as it repre&s;ents him not in compounded or in concrete Terms, but in &s;imple and ab&s;tract ones. <HI>e. g.</HI> When he is therein call'd <HI>Love.</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 8. <HI>He that Loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is Love.</HI> 2dly. God is call'd <HI>Life.</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> v. 20. <HI>This is the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e God and eternal Life.</HI> 3dly He is &s;aid to be <HI>Light in which there is no Darkne&s;s at all,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> i. 5. <HI>i. e.</HI> His Godhead has nothing of a different kind, which is not pure Godhead.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="005500_0161_1039650569D0CDB0">And indeed the Simplicity of God, follows nece&s;&s;arily from many other of God's Perfections. e. g. 1&s;t. From his <HI>Self-Exi&s;tence,</HI> by which he is ab&s;olutely the fir&s;t Being, if by Com|po&s;ition there were different Things in God, then there would be many fir&s;t Things, of which none would be ab&s;olutely the fir&s;t, becau&s;e not before the Parts join'd with it: More|over if God were compounded, there mu&s;t be one to com|pound him, who mu&s;t exi&s;t before the fir&s;t, which is im|po&s;&s;ible. And 2dly, The Simplicity of God follows from his Independency: For on the contrary, what is compound|ed cannot be Independent, for then the whole depends upon the compo&s;ing Parts, and the Union of tho&s;e Parts depends upon the Compo&s;er. 3dly, God is immutable and therefore a &s;imple Being, for what&s;oever is compounded, is liable to be di&s;olv'd into the Parts of which the Compo&s;ition is made, and thus it is changeable. 4thly. The <HI>Eternity of God</HI> proves him to be a <HI>&s;imple Being,</HI> for what&s;oever has had a Beginning may have an End! To this we may farther add, his <HI>Infinity</HI> and <HI>Perfections.</HI> And 1&s;t. If God be <HI>Infinite,</HI> as the Scriptures a&s;&s;erts when it informs us, <HI>That he fills the Heaven and Earth, and that the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him,</HI> than he is a &s;imple Being: For what&s;oever is compounded is finite, the Parts compo&s;ing mu&s;t needs be finite, becau&s;e they are le&s;s than the Whole. And it is im|po&s;&s;ible for a Number of finite Parts to produce Infinity. 2dly. If God be a mo&s;t <HI>Perfect Being</HI> as the Scripture a&s;&s;erts Mat. v. 48. <HI>Be Perfect as your Heavenly Father is Perfect,</HI> then he is a &s;imple one. Becau&s;e not only all Men acknow|ledge that it is more Perfect to be Wi&s;dom it&s;elf, than to be Wi&s;e, to be Goodne&s;s it &s;elf, than to be Good: But al&s;o the Notion of a Part involves a manifold Imperfection, ina&s;much as it has not the Perfection of the Whole, and pre-requires a Compo&s;er.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="005500_0162_1039650302D5EBF0">Now the <HI>Simplicity of God</HI> is a <HI>divine Property whereby he is void of all Compo&s;ition, Mixture and Divi&s;ion, being all E&s;&s;ence, &s;o that what&s;oever is in God, is God.</HI> The Almighty by his <HI>Simplicity</HI> is free from all Kinds of Compo&s;ition, by which different Things unite. As particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. From a Compo&s;ition of <HI>quantitative</HI> or <HI>bulky Parts</HI> which belongs to Bodies; but God is a Spirit, as has been al|ready made evident.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Of <HI>e&s;&s;ential Parts,</HI> &s;uch as Matter and Form, the&s;e belong only to Bodies, but God is immaterial.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Of <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>Accident.</HI> Seeing that all Acci|dents are judg'd more imperfect than the Sub&s;tances to which they belong, and are liable to change, as Whitene&s;s in the Wall, they are therefore incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine Perfection.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Of <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> and <HI>Exi&s;tence,</HI> &s;eeing that <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> is but an Act of the <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> and nothing different from it, which might infer a Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Of <HI>Genus</HI> and <HI>Difference,</HI> which every Species contains: God is a Being above Being, in nothing he agrees with others, but in all Things he differs from all. But on the Contrary, every Creature is &s;ubject to Compo&s;ition, and con&s;equently to Divi&s;ion. All Things which are created, are made by joining together into one, more Things than one, and &s;o they con&s;i&s;t of divers Things. Some have a more gro&s;s Compo&s;ition of Parts, both E&s;&s;ential and Inte|gral. As a Man, of Soul and Body; and the Body of Fle&s;h, Blood and Bones. Some have a finer Compo&s;ition, <HI>e. g.</HI> an Angel is compounded of <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>Accidents</HI> that cleave thereto. His Sub&s;tance or E&s;&s;ence, his Faculties and Qualities are different Things. His Life is one Thing; his Will, Power, Wi&s;dom, Agility, or Nimblene&s;s other Things. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid of his Goodne&s;s, which
<PB N="160" REF="005500_0163_10396501586DF3B8">
the Scriptures inform us, &s;ome Angels have lo&s;t and yet retain their Beings. And thus the Soul of Man and all other Creatures are made up of many Things joined together.</P>
<P>But God is ab&s;olutely <HI>Simple,</HI> without Parts or Accidents; his E&s;&s;ence and Attributes are all one Thing in him, tho' differently conceiv'd of by us! But here let it be carefully ob&s;erved, that <HI>Simplicity,</HI> as it is oppos'd to <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> which is &s;ometimes the Sen&s;e of the Word in Scripture (<HI>Pro.</HI> i. 22.) cannot without the greate&s;t Bla&s;phemy be a&s;crib'd to God. It is therefore <HI>Simplicity</HI> only, as it is <HI>oppos'd</HI> to <HI>Mixture</HI> and <HI>Compo&s;ition,</HI> that is to be a&s;crib'd to God.
<Q>That is pro|perly called <HI>Simple (&s;ays</HI> Zanchy) which is not compo&s;ed of different Things. And by how much the le&s;s any Thing is compounded, &s;o much the more Simple it is, and is call'd.</Q> But</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Is God a <HI>Spirit?</HI> Then we &s;hould frame no re&s;em|blance of him in our Thoughts as tho' he were a material Being or had a Body! And far le&s;s &s;hould we form Pictures and Images of God, either for Decency or Devotion. It is Folly with a Witne&s;s to pretend to draw the Lineaments or Form of an immaterial and invi&s;ible Being. And indeed it is an idolatrous Practice, which the Almighty &s;trictly caution'd the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> again&s;t, Deut. vi. 12, 15, 16. <HI>And the Lord &s;pake unto you out of the mid&s;t of the Fire, ye heard the Voice of the Words but &s;aw no &s;imilitude; take therefore good Heed unto your&s;elves, for ye &s;aw no manner of Similitude in</HI> Horeb, <HI>le&s;t ye corrupt your&s;elves and make you a graven Image, the Similitude of any Figure, the likene&s;s of Male or Female.</HI> But</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Is God a <HI>Spirit?</HI> Then he is the mo&s;t &s;uitable Good to our Souls, which are Spirits. As he is a &s;piritual Being, he &s;uits their Nature and can communicate him&s;elf to them, And as he is All-&s;ufficient, he can fully &s;atisfy their mo&s;t
<PB N="161" REF="005500_0164_103964FFB79EEFF8">
exten&s;ive De&s;ires. But on the Contrary, tho' earthly Enter|tainments may gratify our &s;en&s;ual Appeties, yet, becau&s;e of their gro&s;s and elementary Nature, they cannot &s;atisfy, and do not &s;uit our Souls, neither in re&s;pect of their Nature and Dignity, or their De&s;ires and Duration. It was there|fore exceeding fooli&s;h in the rich Man to &s;ay to his Soul, in re&s;pect of &s;uch Things, <HI>that it had much Goods laid up for many Years.</HI> Such Entertainments can no more &s;atisfy the anxious Soul, than Hu&s;ks, Gravel-Stones, or the Ea&s;t Wind can &s;atisfy the cravings of our Stomach! And it is with great Ju&s;tice that the Scriptures a&s;cribe &s;uch ignominious Epithets to all <HI>earthly Good,</HI> to &s;ignify in the &s;tronge&s;t Terms its in&s;ufficiency to content the Mind.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Is God a <HI>Spirit?</HI> This &s;hews us then the ne-nece&s;&s;ity of Spiritual Wor&s;hip. This indeed is plainly ex|pre&s;s'd in our Text. Such a Wor&s;hip is &s;uitable to the Na|ture of God, and will be only accepted by him. The ju&s;tne&s;s of this inference &s;ome of the Pagans di&s;covered by the Dint of Natures Light. <HI>Cato</HI> &s;peaks excellently about it in his Di&s;ticks, in the following Manner.</P>
<Q><L>Sideus e&s;tanimus nobis ut carmina dicunt.</L>
<L>Hic tibi precipue &s;it pura mente colendus, i. e.</L></Q>
<P>If God is a Spirit, as the Poets inform us, then our cheif Care, &s;hould be to wor&s;hip him with a pure Mind.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing this &s;piritual Wor&s;hip is the Touch-Stone of true Chri&s;tianity, we &s;hould be hereby enduced to exa|mine our&s;elves with all Speed and Seriou&s;ne&s;s, whether we perform it or not, and that by an impartial and deliberate Application of what has been &s;aid concerning it, in the doctrinal Part of this Di&s;cour&s;e. Now if upon Tryal we find the afore&s;aid Characters of &s;piritual Wor&s;hip in us, we may and ought to rejoyce in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, notwith&s;tanding our many defects, becau&s;e we are compleat in him. Sincere Intentions are accepted for Performances, e&s;pecially when an

<P>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be prai&s;ed; and his Great|ne&s;s is un&s;earchable.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Text repre&s;ents to us the Infinity of God's E&s;|&s;ence or Being, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of Honouring him on this Account. And 1&s;t. we have a Re|pre&s;entation of the Infinity of the divine Being, more generally in the&s;e Words, <HI>great is the Lord</HI> or <HI>Jehovah.</HI> Here God, denominated by his E&s;&s;ence, is &s;aid to be great: For the Name <HI>Jehovah</HI> intends his E&s;&s;ence or Being, that thus we might know his E&s;&s;ence is Infinite. The Word <HI>great</HI> mu&s;t either refer to Quantity or Quality, if to Quantity, then either to Number or Magnitude; in re&s;pect of Num|ber God is one, but &s;o one, as eminently to include yea ex|ceed all! In re&s;pect of Magnitude, God is great without Quan|tity, as he is good without Quality, <HI>i. e.</HI> As his Goodne&s;s is not any Thing added to his Being, as it is in Creatures; but is the &s;ame with it, &s;o his Greatne&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t in the Bulk or Dimen&s;ions of Bodys, &s;uch as Heigth, Depth, Breadth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But if the Word <HI>great,</HI> be apply'd to Quality, then it denotes the Excellency of a Thing or Per&s;on, together with an eminent Degree of that Excellency. And thus it is
<PB N="166" REF="005500_0169_103964F770FBBFC8">
with God, he exceeds all others in Excellency; but we have in the Words of our Text, a more Particular De&s;crip|tion of the Infinity of the divine Being, in the&s;e Words. <HI>And his Greatne&s;s is un&s;earchable,</HI> or as the Words are in|terpreted by others, <HI>has no End,</HI> as that which is finite may be &s;earched, &s;o on the contrary that which is un|&s;earchable mu&s;t needs be Infinite, <HI>Job.</HI> 5.9. <HI>Which doth great Things and un&s;earchable, marvellous Things without Number.</HI> Rom. xi. 33. <HI>O the Depth of the Riches, both of the Wi&s;dom and Knowledge of God, how un&s;earchable ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Judgments, and his Ways pa&s;t finding out!</HI> Which is empha|tically expre&s;s'd by comparative Terms, whereby God is &s;aid to be greater than all other Gods. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> ii. 5. <HI>And the Hou&s;e which I build is great, for great is our God above all Gods.</HI> P&s;al. cxxxv. 5. <HI>For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all Gods.</HI> i. e. Not only above Emperors, Kings, Princes and Magi&s;trates, who are call'd Gods, becau&s;e they bear &s;ome Image of the divine Sove|reignty, by their Superiority and Power of Government; <HI>but al&s;o above all</HI> fal&s;e <HI>Gods,</HI> who are great in the Opinion of their Wor&s;hippers. The Number of which in the Time of <HI>He&s;iod,</HI> was above Thirty Thou&s;and, to every of which was a&s;&s;ign'd &s;ome peculiar Perfection; without doubt then, he who is greater than all tho&s;e mu&s;t needs be infinite, and ought to be prai&s;ed as &s;uch; which is the 2d. Particular our Text contains. <HI>Great is the Lord and greatly to be prais'd.</HI> God &s;hould be greatly honour'd by our Minds, and highly extol'd by our Lips and Lives. He &s;hould be prais'd in the &s;uperlative Degree, more than any, more than all, becau&s;e he is greater and more excellent than all, in his Being and Per|fections.

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Scriptures a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Infinity</HI> of God's <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> not only in tho&s;e Places already mentioned, but al&s;o in the&s;e following <HI>viz. Job</HI> xxxvi. 26. <HI>Behold God is great, and we know him not, neither can the Number of his Years be &s;earch|ed out,</HI> Job. xi. 7, 8, 9. <HI>Can&s;t thou by &s;earching find out God, can&s;t thou find out the Almighty unto Perfection, it is high as Heaven, what can&s;t thou do, deeper than Hell what can&s;t thou know? The Mea&s;ure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea.</HI> And Rea&s;on al&s;o confirms the &s;ame Truth, as appears by the following Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. If God's Being and Perfections are incomprehen&s;i|ble, as has been prov'd in this, and in a preceeding Sermon, then certainly they are infinite. The great Rea&s;on why Men and Angels cannot gra&s;p the Knowledge of the di|vine Being is, becau&s;e it is too va&s;t an Object for their fi|nite Capacities to compa&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. There is nothing in Creatures that argues an End or Defect, either in their Being, Power, Pre&s;ence, or Dura|tion; for which they are call'd finite, which is not very alien or remote from God, and therefore he is Infinite.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. He created the World out of nothing, which re|quir'd infinite Power, becau&s;e of an infinite Di&s;tance which was to be overcome, between nothing and &s;omething.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Seeing the highe&s;t Perfection, is nece&s;&s;arily includ|ed in the Notion of a God, and this the Scriptures confirm, by calling him <HI>the mo&s;t High,</HI> P&s;al. xviii. 13. Then his Be|ing and Attributes are Infinite: For &s;omething higher and
<PB N="168" REF="005500_0171_103964F34E61C340">
more excellent than finite may be conceiv'd, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ome|thing that is Infinite. And</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Seeing he is ab&s;olutely the fir&s;t Being he mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be Infinite, for thus there can be none before him, to limit his Being and Perfections. If his Being had any Bounds, it could not be ab&s;olute. The Rea&s;on why Crea|tures are finite is, becau&s;e they are made by another, who has circum&s;crib'd their Beings within certain Limits. Now that God is ab&s;olutely the fir&s;t Being, exi&s;ting of him&s;elf, has been already prov'd in a preceeding Sermon.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. Fora&s;much as all the various Perfections of Crea|tures, both Angelical and Human in Heaven and Earth, are borrow'd from God. He who is the unexhau&s;ted Foun|tain, from which they all flow, mu&s;t be Immen&s;e and In|finite: For &s;urely the Giver mu&s;t be greater than the Recei|ver. Hence is that notable Scripture. <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 35, 36. <HI>Who hath fir&s;t given to him and it &s;hall be recompen&s;ed unto him again, for of him, and thro' him, and to him are all Things.</HI> I proceed to con&s;ider the</P>
<P N="2">2d. Propos'd which was to explain <HI>the Nature of God's Infinity, e&s;pecially in his E&s;&s;ence;</HI> which may be thus de&s;crib'd, <HI>viz. That it is an incommunicable Property of</HI> Jehovah, <HI>whereby he is without all Bounds and Limitations in his Be|ing and Perfections.</HI> The Infinity of God may be &s;aid to re&s;pect, either his Attributes or his Being; as it re&s;pects his Attributes, thus his Ju&s;tice, Power, Wi&s;dom, Holine&s;s, Grace, Mercy, and Duration, are &s;aid to be Infinite in Scripture, that is without Bounds, Limits, or End. As it re&s;pects his Be|ing, it &s;ignifies that it neither is, or can be bounded, neither outwardly by an encompa&s;&s;ing Body, as material Things are, nor inwardly, by proper Limits, as created Spirits. All Creatures both Human and Angelical, as well as others are
<PB N="169" REF="005500_0172_103964F1C7416C00">
bounded by their E&s;&s;ences, the Form acting upon the Mat|ter limits it within its own Confines. But God is unlimited, and can't be <HI>&s;earched out to Perfection. Job.</HI> xi. 7. And in|deed this is applicable to all that can be &s;aid of him! Hence &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t <HI>his under&s;tanding is infinite.</HI> And indeed infinity is the peculiar Glory of God, whereby he is di&s;tingui&s;h'd from and far advanced above all &s;econdary Beings.</P>
<P>God is infinite not according to the Etimology of the Word, which re&s;pects an End only, for he is without Be|ginning and End. <HI>Zanchy</HI> ob&s;erves,
<Q>That a Thing is call'd <HI>privativly</HI> Infinite, which indeed hath not an End, but can have it. This is applicable to the noble&s;t Creatures even to Angels and the Souls of Men.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And <HI>2dly.</HI> That that is <HI>negatively</HI> infinite, which neither has nor can have any End.</Q> In this Sen&s;e God only is infinite, yet when we &s;ay that God is negatively infinite, a po&s;itive Perfection is thereby intended.
<Q><HI>Infinity</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Gomarus</HI>) is an ab&s;olute property of the E&s;&s;ence of God, which is not limitted or circum&s;crib'd by any Terms, or Bounds of Cau&s;e or Mea&s;ure.</Q> To explain this, let it be ob&s;erv'd, that every Creature hath a fourfold Limitation, <HI>viz.</HI> Of the <HI>Kind</HI> of <HI>Being, Degrees</HI> of Being, of <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Place.</HI></P>
<P>And. 1&s;t. Creatures are limitted as to their <HI>Kinds</HI> of <HI>Being,</HI> &s;ome are of one Kind, and &s;ome of another &s;ome are &s;imple, &s;ome compounded, &s;ome have Bodies, &s;ome not, &s;ome have Life, &s;ome none, &s;ome have Sen&s;e &s;ome none. The great Creator hath fix'd them in their &s;e|veral Kinds and Orders, that &s;o the whole Frame of Things may be beautify'd with variety. But God him&s;elf is not li|mited to any kind of Being. He hath in him&s;elf all Kinds, not &s;ubjectively, but eminently.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Creatures are limited to <HI>Degrees</HI> of <HI>Being</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> or Excellency, &s;ome have higher and &s;ome lower
<PB N="170" REF="005500_0173_103964F020930CE0">
Degrees, but the Being of God is ab&s;olute perfect and infinite and &s;o beyond all Degrees and Mea&s;ures; and thus are all his Attributes which &s;pring from his Being, and on|ly differ there from in our Manner of conceiving.</P>
<P N="3">3dly Creatures are limited as to <HI>Time</HI> or <HI>Duration</HI> they have a Beginning either with or in Time, and a Succe&s;&s;ion in Du|ration, and either have or may have an End. But God is Eternal an Everla&s;ting Now, without Beginning, Succe&s;&s;ion, or End.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Creatures are limitted as to <HI>Place,</HI> they are includ|ed in a Place, and cannot be every where at once, but God is Immen&s;e and Omnipre&s;ent. And thus I am led to &s;peak upon the</P>
<P N="3">3d, Propos'd, viz. the <HI>Immen&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Omnipre&s;ence</HI> of God. The&s;e Words repre&s;ent the &s;ame Thing after a diffe|rent Manner. <HI>Infinity,</HI> as it cannot be mea&s;ured by Place, or any other Dimen&s;ions of Length, Breadth, Depth, Height, is call'd <HI>Immen&s;ity.</HI> As it ex&s;i&s;ts with every Creature, it is call'd <HI>Omnipre&s;ence;</HI> and as it co-exi&s;ts every where, it is call'd <HI>Ubiquity.</HI> This Attribute of God may be thus de|&s;crib'd, viz. <HI>That it is the Infinity of the divine. E&s;&s;ence, as that exi&s;ts with all Space.</HI> By <HI>Space,</HI> we are to under&s;tand nothing more than where a Creature does or may exi&s;t, and therefore it is two Fold, viz. 1&s;t. either a vacuum or void, where a Creature can exi&s;t, or a Place where it actually does exi&s;t. Therefore Space is properly no Being, much le&s;s a Body, for then when a Body is in a Place, one Body would be in another. Neither is it the &s;ame with a Body which is contain'd in a Place, for when a Body is remov'd the Place containing remain's. Neither are Breadth and Length, and other &s;uch like Dimen&s;ions, properly in Space; but in the Bodies which are or may be contain'd therein. Now the Almighty is not extended together with Space, or diffus'd thro' it, for the&s;e Things only belong to Bodies. <HI>Jehovah</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="005500_0174_103964EE589F3900">
being without Matter or Parts, mu&s;t be without Exten&s;ion; and having no Matter he can have no Form, which belongs to Matter, and gives it the Dimen&s;ions of Weadth and Length, &amp;c. The Almighty only exi&s;ts together with all Space, not by Multiplication of him&s;elf, for he is one; nor by Divi&s;ion by Parts, being partly in Heaven and partly on Earth, for he is mo&s;t <HI>Simple</HI> and cannot be divided: Nei|ther can the Almighty be circum&s;crib'd or bounded by Space, becau&s;e he is a Spirit; or limitted to a certain Place, becau&s;e he is Infinite. God exi&s;ts with all Space by filling of it. Jer. xxiii. 24. <HI>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth, &s;ayeth the Lord.</HI> The Almighty indeed does not fill Space as Bo|dies do, becau&s;e his Being there does not exclude the Crea|ture: Whereas two Bodies cannot occupy the &s;ame Place in the &s;ame In&s;tant of Time. But <HI>Jehovah</HI> fills all Places in the following re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. So as not to be <HI>included</HI> in any <HI>Place</HI> or encompa&s;&s;ed, for then he mu&s;t be finite: <HI>But the Heaven of Heavens can|not contain him.</HI> And</P>
<P N="2">2dly, So as not to be <HI>excluded</HI> out of any <HI>Place;</HI> and hence it is &s;aid, Act. xvii. 27. <HI>That he is not far from every one of us.</HI> Even the Heathens, by the Light of Nature, could &s;ay,
<Q>Jovis omnia plena; all Things are full of <HI>Jupiter.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3">3dly, So as to be <HI>without Motion from Place to Place:</HI> And therefore, when the Scriptures &s;peak of his <HI>de&s;cending from Heaven to Earth, his riding on a Cherub, and on the Wings of the Wind,</HI> it is only a form of Speech accom|modated to our weak Way of conceiving of God and di|vine Things, importing &s;ome &s;pecial Manife&s;tation of God in his Works of Providence. And</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="172" REF="005500_0175_103964ECD54B4F28">4thly, So as to be <HI>beyond all Place;</HI> for what is Place but the Limit of created Beings? It mu&s;t therefore be finite how va&s;t &s;oever it be, and therefore cannot contain the infinite God.</P>
<P>The Holy Scriptures a&s;&s;ert in &s;trong Terms, the <HI>Omnipre|&s;ence</HI> of God, <HI>P&s;a.</HI> cxxxix. from the 7th to the 10th Ver&s;es, <HI>Whether &s;hall I go from thy Spirit, or whither &s;hall I flee from thy Pre&s;ence? If I a&s;&s;end up into Heaven, thou art there, If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I take the Wings of the Morning and dwell in the uttermo&s;t Parts of the Sea, even there &s;hall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand &s;hall hold me.</HI> Act. xvii. 28. <HI>For in him we live and move and have our Being.</HI> And indeed the <HI>Omnipre&s;ence</HI> of God ne|ce&s;&s;arily follows from his <HI>Infinity,</HI> which we have before con|&s;idered: For what is Infinite in E&s;&s;ence, cannot be re&s;tricted to any Place. It is contradictory to &s;uppo&s;e that that which is boundle&s;s, &s;hould be bounded; it is ju&s;t in other Words to &s;ay, that that which hath no limits, nor po&s;&s;ibly can have them, yet that it hath them; which is ab&s;urd!</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, to be re&s;trained by any to a Place, is as incon|&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Independency</HI> of God, as Motion from Place to Place is with his immutability or unchangablene&s;s!</P>
<P>It likewi&s;e follows from the Almightyne&s;s of God, that he can Work every where, which could not be if he were limited to any Place.</P>
<P>And how can we &s;uppo&s;e, that a perfect Being, who is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with all Perfection, can want that of Omnipre&s;ence, without a manife&s;t Contradiction? And that the various Perfections of God admit of no Degrees or Mea&s;ures, fol|lows nece&s;&s;arily from his <HI>Simplicity.</HI> Compounded Beings admit of Degrees and Dimen&s;ions, but &s;uch as are Simple, have none: Sweet Things have their Degrees, but Sweet|ne&s;s it&s;elf is above all Degrees!</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="005500_0176_103964EAF28A2028">But before I proceed to the Improvement of this Subject, I would have it ob&s;erv'd, that altho' the <HI>Immen&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Om|nipre&s;ence</HI> of God, does in the fir&s;t place, concern his E&s;&s;ence, yet that it doth al&s;o re&s;pect his <HI>Knowledge,</HI> his <HI>Operations,</HI> his <HI>Providence,</HI> by his <HI>E&s;&s;ence.</HI> Hence all Things are &s;aid <HI>to be naked and open unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do,</HI> Heb. iv. 13. And hence God is &s;aid <HI>to uphold all Things by the Word of his Power,</HI> Heb. i. 3. Now in re|&s;pect of God's <HI>Operations,</HI> he is &s;aid to be variou&s;ly pre&s;ent with Creatures.</P>

<P N="1">1&s;t.

<P><PB N="179" REF="005500_0182_103964E115190FE0">O! how refre&s;hing is it to think that God is not only with his People, pre&s;ent by his <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> but pre&s;ent by his <HI>Wi&s;dom, Power</HI> and <HI>Providence!</HI> to conduct, &s;upport, protect and revive them in every Difficulty, and to &s;anctify them to them. How careful &s;hould we be therefore, that this great omnipre&s;ent God, &s;hould be ours in the Covenant of his Grace, by embracing the Mediator of the Covenant by a living Faith, and living to him that died for us. We may be &s;eparated from our earthly Friends very far, but God is e|very where: He was with <HI>Daniel</HI> in the Den of Lyons; with <HI>Jonah</HI> in the Water; with the <HI>three Children</HI> in the Fire; with <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> in Pri&s;on, and with <HI>John</HI> in the Retirements of <HI>Patmos!</HI> If we live humbly and watchfully, no human Art or Violence can &s;eperate him from our Em|braces!

The Darkne&s;s bides not from him, but the Night &s;hines as the Day. Hence the Lord him&s;elf commanded the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to remove every filthy Thing out of their Camp, becau&s;e he walk'd in the mid&s;t thereof lea&s;t he &s;hould turn away from them, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxiii. 14. The athei&s;tical Imagination that God is far off, and takes no Cog|nizance of human Actions, is the fatal Source of Sin and Security! Hence &s;ome are induc'd to commit tho&s;e Evils in Secret, which they dar'&s;t not do, in the Pre&s;ence of the meane&s;t Witne&s;s, not con&s;idering that Con&s;cience is as a Thou&s;and Witne&s;&s;es, and that God is infinitely greater <HI>than our Hearts, and knoweth all things,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> iii. 20.

The Lord is every where Pre&s;ent with us, <Q>For God is all Eye, and continually beholds us; he is all Ear and ince&s;&s;antly hears us,</Q> as <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> ob&s;erves. He bottles all our Tears, and records all our &s;ecret Sighs and Groans, none of our Wre&s;tlings will be lo&s;t! For that God who now &s;ees in Secret, will by and by reward openly. Surely Solitarine&s;s &s;hould neither embolden us to Sin, or hinder us from Duty. Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> in his Body of Divinity, tells the following Story of two religious Men, who took two contrary Cour&s;es with two lend Women in order to re|claim them,
<Q>The one came to one of the Women as de&s;irous of her Company, &s;o it might be with &s;ecre&s;y, and when &s;he had brought him to a clo&s;e Room that none could pry into, then he told her that all the Bolts and Bars which were,

<P>In fine let us be exhorted to labour to walk &s;incerely with God evermore, and every where as pre&s;ent with us; in Imitation of Enoch, <HI>Gen.</HI> v. 24. <HI>And</HI> Enoch <HI>walked with God:</HI> Of <HI>Noah</HI> Gen. vi. 9.

This the Holy Scriptures many Ways require, when it urges us not only to <HI>walk with God,</HI> but <HI>to walk before him, after him in his Name,</HI> and <HI>by his Spirit.</HI> Let us therefore obandon all Hypocri&s;y, walk with Fear and Re|verence as under the Eye of God; on the one Hand ab&s;taining-from every Evil, becau&s;e of a pre&s;ent God; and on the o|ther Hand embracing every opportunity to do pre&s;ent Good, without delay and without di&s;gui&s;e, <HI>not with Eye Service as Men plea&s;ers, but in &s;inglene&s;s of Heart fearing God,</HI> that we may have the Te&s;timony of our Con&s;ciences here, and be ac|cepted of by the great Omnipre&s;ent and Omni&s;cient God hereafter; which may God grant for CHRIST'S &s;ake.</P>

<P>THIS Text contains an admiring Exclamation, re|&s;pecting the tran&s;cendent Knowledge and Wi&s;dom of God, more e&s;pecially apparent in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Redemption and Prede&s;tination, in which we may ob&s;erve three Things <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. The Per&s;on exclaiming, <HI>Paul</HI> an Apo&s;tle, yea one of the mo&s;t eminent of that Order. A Per&s;on of a piercing Genius, and polite Learning, bred at the Feet of <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Advances in Grace and divine Knowledge, a Per&s;on peculiarly famous for un|wearied and exten&s;ive Labours to promote the Good of Mankind, and moreover one whom the Almighty was plea|&s;ed to in&s;pire after an extraordinary Manner, to communicate the Knowledge of him&s;elf in his Son to a lo&s;t World! Yet here we may behold this excellent Per&s;on maz'd and non-plus'd, and that in a Matter belonging to his own Pro|vince, a Matter which he made the &s;ubject of his careful En|quiries! This leads to a 2d. Particular in the Exclamation,

<HI>viz.</HI> The Particle <HI>O!</HI> which is the <HI>Manner</HI> of it. This repre&s;ents the Strength and vehemence of the Apo&s;tles pious Pa&s;&s;ion, in this and in the two preceeding Chapters, he had &s;poken of many profound My&s;teries, and an&s;wered many critical Que&s;tions. But here he makes a Pau&s;e, and falls into an Admiration of God, in re&s;pect of his Wi&s;dom and Knowledge! He &s;eems like a Man who wades in deep Waters, till he loo&s;es Ground, and then cries out, O the Depth! And &s;o proceeds no farther.

As if he had &s;aid I have ex|pounded the&s;e Things as I could; but I am &s;wallow'd up in the Aby&s;s of the Councils of God, which cannot be &s;earched to Perfection, but mu&s;t be adored.</Q> Now the</P>

By the <HI>Judgments of God,</HI> the Context leads us to under&s;tand, his Decrees and Purpo&s;es! And by his Ways, the Execution of them in General, and more e&s;pecially that In&s;tance thereof which appear'd in the Rejection of the Jews, and calling in of the Gentiles to their Priviledges. The Apo&s;tle declares concerning both, that they are Un&s;earchable <HI>i. e.</HI> they cannot be fully under&s;tood, and perfectly found out by any Creature, however intelligent he be, e&s;pecially in this World <Q>It's a Metaphor (<HI>&s;ays</HI> Pool <HI>in his Annotations</HI>) taken from Hounds, who have no Scent of the Game which they pur&s;ue.

and therefore &s;hould forbear cen&s;uring them.</Q> Tho' great Wi&s;dom and Knowledge attend the divine Purpo&s;es and Providences, yet it is &s;uch a Depth, as cannot be &s;ounded thoroughly by the Line of human Rea&s;on.

The Wi&s;dom and Know|ledge of God exceed all Dimen&s;ions,</HI> as <HI>Zophar</HI> elegantly ob|&s;erves, <HI>Job</HI> xi. 8, 9. <HI>It is higher than Heaven, deeper than Hell, longer than the Earth and broader than the Sea!</HI> The Word <HI>Riches</HI> &s;ignifies an exce&s;s of Wealth, by which a Per|&s;on has more than he needs. And therefore here it intimates the exceeding Abundance, and tran&s;cendent Eminence and Affluence of the divine Wi&s;dom and Knowledge, which we we can neither &s;peak or think highly enough of! Altho' God's Wi&s;dom and Knowledge be one and the &s;ame in him|&s;elf, yet in our Manner of conceiving of them they are di&s;|tingui&s;h'd: For Knowledge is meerly &s;peculative, and be|holds Things &s;imply as they are; but Wi&s;dom di&s;po&s;es them in a certain order to &s;ome valuable End.</P>
<P>From the Text thus explain'd, two Propo&s;itions offer them&s;elves to our Con&s;ideration, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. That the <HI>Knowledge of God is deep, un&s;earchable and Infinite.</HI> And 2dly. <HI>That the Wi&s;dom of God is &s;o al&s;o</HI> I return to the 1&s;t. Propo&s;ition which was as before de&s;crib'd. Altho' <HI>Know|ledge</HI> be put after <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> in our Text, (perhaps by the Figure call'd <HI>hy&s;teron proteron</HI>) yet in the Order of Nature it &s;eems to be before it: For we fir&s;t behold Things, be|fore we di&s;po&s;e them in any Order to a certain End. Now in di&s;cour&s;ing upon this Subject, I &s;hall labour to pro&s;ecute the following Order.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Prove the Infinity of the divine <HI>Knowledge.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Shew the Kinds thereof.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="185" REF="005500_0188_103964D75C632A88">III. Speak of the Properties of God's <HI>Knowledge.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Point to its various Objects, and la&s;tly improve the whole. And</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The &s;acred Scriptures fully a&s;&s;ert this Truth, <HI>P&s;.</HI> cxxxix. 9, 10. <HI>If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the utermo&s;t Parts of the Sea, even there &s;hall thy Right Hand lead me.</HI> 1 Sam ii. 3. <HI>The Lord is a God of Knowledge, and by him Actions are weighed.</HI> Pro. v. 21. <HI>The Ways of a Man are before the Lord and he pondereth all his Paths.</HI> Pro. xv. 3. <HI>The Eyes of the Lord are in every Place, beholding the Evil and the Good.</HI> Job xxxiv. 21, 22. <HI>For his Eyes are upon the Ways of Men, and he &s;eeth all their Goings. There is no Darkne&s;s nor Shadow of Death, where the Workers of Iniquity may hide them&s;elves.</HI> Heb. iv. 13. <HI>Neither is there any Creature that is not manife&s;t in his Sight, but all Things are naked and opened unto the Eyes of him, with whom we have to do.</HI></P>
<P>And right Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ures us of the &s;ame Truth. For</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Seeing to know and under&s;tand is an Excellency involving no Imperfection in it, it cannot without a Con|tradiction, be deny'd to an infinitely perfect being. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. How can the &s;upream Being be without Knowledge, &s;eeing he is the Fountain and Original of all that Know|ledge, which intelligent Beings po&s;&s;e&s;s? <HI>It is in his Light, that they &s;ee Light. Shall not he that planted the Eye &s;ee, and he that form'd the Ear hear?</HI> And without Knowledge what would the Almighty be but an Idol of whom it is &s;aid, <HI>P&s;.</HI> cxv. 6, 7. <HI>That they have Eyes and &s;ee not, Ears and hear not.</HI> But thus to imagine of God, is the ba&s;e&s;t Bla&s;phemy! Now the infinite Extent of the divine Know|ledge, is evident from the following Con&s;iderations, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Becau&s;e it is the &s;ame with his Being, which his Simplicity a&s;&s;ures us of. Now the Being of God has been
<PB N="186" REF="005500_0189_103964D57098DF48">
prov'd to be infinite in a preceeding Sermon, and there|fore his Knowledge mu&s;t needs be &s;o, which coincides with it. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Seeing God has given Being to all Things at Fir&s;t, it cannot without a Contradiction be &s;uppos'd, that he &s;hould be ignorant of the Effects of his own Power. Mu&s;t not a Workman know his Work? Be&s;ides</P>
<P N="3">3dly. As <HI>Jehovah</HI> by his Almightine&s;s has brought the whole Univer&s;e out of Nothing into Being, &s;o he conti|nually &s;upports the &s;ame, otherwi&s;e it would immediatley return to its primitive Non-Entity or Nothingne&s;s: <HI>For it is in him we live move and have our Being.</HI> As we could not at fir&s;t begin to exi&s;t without God, &s;o neither can we &s;ub|&s;i&s;t a Moment, or think, or &s;peak, or act without him, who is the great Source of Being and Spring of Mo|tion! And</P>
<P N="4">4thly. As God upholds every Thing by his Power, &s;o he governs. All by his &s;overeign wi&s;e and unerring Provi|dence in the be&s;t Manner, and to the noble&s;t End. <HI>viz. His own Glory.</HI> Surely then the End and Means conducing thereto, mu&s;t be known by him; and indeed if the Kingdom of God did not rule over all, as the Scriptures a&s;&s;ert, all Nature would be in Confu&s;ion, the di&s;cordant Elements would immediately break their pre&s;ent Harmony, and jum|ble into the wilde&s;t Chaos, and con&s;equently di&s;&s;olve in a tumultuous and exten&s;ive Ruin! The Innocen&s;e, the Lives, the Goods of intelligent Creatures would in&s;tantly be made an ea&s;y Prey to rapacious Lu&s;ts and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Violence! The whole Globe would groan with a melancholy Train of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Tragedies, and &s;oon be ting'd with a crim&s;on Flood!</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Seeing the Almighty hath fixed a Deputy in our Bo|&s;oms, I mean Con&s;cience, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to ob&s;erve and
<PB N="187" REF="005500_0190_103964D3ECBE3940">
regi&s;ter our whole Behaviour, who&s;e company we cannot &s;hun, who&s;e Cognizance we cannot e&s;cape! How much more then mu&s;t the Almighty be acquainted with all our Ways? <HI>For he is greater than our Hearts, and knoweth all Things,</HI> as the A|po&s;tle <HI>John</HI> ob&s;erves. Again</P>
<P N="6">6thly. Methinks the Con&s;ideration of the general Judg|ment, gives additional Evidence to the afore&s;aid Truth, for how can <HI>Jehovah</HI> judge all, unle&s;s he knows all? The A|po&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 16. <HI>That God will bring every Work into Judgment, with every &s;ecret Thing, whether it be Good or whether it be Evil.</HI> Yea, Hi&s;tory both &s;acred and prophane inform us, of God's bringing to publick Light crim&s;on Evils, before veil'd with the Curtains of ob&s;cure&s;t Secre&s;y! But I proceed to the 2d. propos'd, which was to &s;peak of the <HI>Kinds</HI> of divine Knowledge. And here I may ob&s;erve, that as it re&s;pects Creatures, it is two fold, <HI>viz.</HI> Either intuitive, or approbative, or as others phra&s;e it, gene|ral or &s;pecial. Now God's general Knowledge, or his Know|ledge of Intuition is that Property of the Almighty, where|by he only knows, or beholds all Things. In this Sen&s;e it is &s;aid <HI>Acts</HI> xv. 18. <HI>That known unto God are all his Works from the Beginning of the World.</HI> And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. God's approbative or &s;pecial Knowledge, is that divine Perfection, whereby <HI>Jehovah</HI> knows &s;o, as to ap|prove of, and delight in what he knows! Hence our Lord, <HI>Mat.</HI> vii. 22. commands the <HI>Wicked to depart from him,</HI> and tells them that he never knew them, that is &s;o as to approve of them. But I pa&s;s on to the</P>
<P N="3">3d. Propos'd, which was to &s;peak of the <HI>Properties</HI> of God's Knowledge. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Knowledge of God is mo&s;t <HI>Simple,</HI> ina&s;much as he beholds at once all Things in him&s;elf, without the U&s;e of any of tho&s;e Methods, whereby human Knowledge is ac|quir'd,
<PB N="188" REF="005500_0191_103964D2661D4B30">
<HI>viz.</HI> The Compo&s;ition of Things of the &s;ame Kind, the Separation of Things of a different Kind, the compa|ring of one Thing with another, and the inferring of one Thing from onother. Hereby the human Mind proceeds gra|dually in a Way of rea&s;oning, from the Knowledge of Things more known, to the Knowledge of Things le&s;s known, but it is the Weakne&s;s of our Under&s;tandings, that renders tho&s;e Mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary, and therefore they cannot con&s;i&s;t with the Perfection of the &s;upream Being. If a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion in Duration be an Imperfection, as was prov'd in a preceeding Sermon concerning the Eternity of God, a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion in Knowledge mu&s;t be &s;o likewi&s;e: For as it ne|ce&s;&s;arily infers Increa&s;e of Knowledge by Ob&s;ervation and Experience, &s;o it as evidently &s;uppo&s;es preceeding Ignorance, which to a&s;cribe to the Almighty is dete&s;table Bla&s;|phemy. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Knowledge of God is <HI>Independent,</HI> becau&s;e it is not in him as an <HI>Accident, Quality,</HI> or <HI>Idea,</HI> different and &s;eparable from his E&s;&s;ence, as it is in Creatures: For then he would be compounded of different Things, as Creatures are, and &s;o might in Time cea&s;e to be. No, his Simplicity a&s;|&s;ures us, as I ob&s;erv'd before, that his Knowledge is the very &s;ame with his E&s;&s;ence, it is no other than God knowing, and therefore mu&s;t needs be independent. That the E&s;|&s;ence of God is independent, has been already proved in a preceeding Sermon. But to proceed</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Knowledge of God is <HI>Eternal,</HI> ina&s;much as he neither begins, or cea&s;es to know, as the Things known by him begin or cea&s;e to be in them&s;elves. The Rea&s;on of which is, becau&s;e he knows all Things by his own E&s;|&s;ence or eternal Purpo&s;es, and not by receiving Species, or Images, or Ideas from Objects without him&s;elf, as Creatures do. Here ob&s;erve that two Things are required to
<PB N="189" REF="005500_0192_103964D0C7FE3808">
con&s;titute the Knowledge of Creatures, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. The Images or Ideas of Things. And 2dly. the Speculation of them, which implies the receiving of tho&s;e Ideas thro' the out|ward Sen&s;es by the Fancy and Contemplation of them be|ing receiv'd, which con&s;i&s;ts partly in the Compari&s;on of a Compo&s;ition, Divi&s;ion, Affirmation, or Negation; and part|ly in Deductions, or Rea&s;onings, whereby we proceed from Things more known to Things le&s;s known. The Method of human Knowledge is by comparing, compounding, di|viding and &s;ub&s;tracting the Images of Things receiv'd; as al&s;o by con&s;idering their Connection and Dependance, and infering one Thing from another. But the Ideas of God are not borrow'd from outward Objects? For if &s;o, Crea|tures mu&s;t exi&s;t, before the divine Knowledge; and then it would be temporary and finite, this cannot be without the De&s;truction of the divine E&s;&s;ence. Two Things indeed are nece&s;&s;ary to the divine Knowledge in our Apprehen&s;ion di&s;|tinct. <HI>viz.</HI> The Pre&s;ence of Ideas and the Perception of them, &s;o that it may be thus de&s;crib'd to be a perfect Intuition of him&s;elf or his own Ideas, but without any receiving of them from without, and without any Compari&s;on, Compo&s;ition, Divi&s;ion, or Inferences, as was ob&s;erv'd before, re&s;pecting the Knowledge of Creatures, for all &s;uch Things, do manife&s;ty involve Imperfection. <HI>Ame&s;ius</HI> in his <HI>Medulla</HI> &s;ayeth,
<Q>That the Idea of God, is no other than his very E&s;&s;ence, as it is under&s;tood by him to be imitable, in the Creature, or &s;o that the Image of that Perfection, may after &s;ome &s;ort be expre&s;s'd in Creatures.</Q> The Idea in a Man, is deriv'd from the Things them&s;elves, and therefore the Things mu&s;t fir&s;t exi&s;t in them&s;elves, then they approach our Sen&s;es, and from thence to our Under&s;tanding, where they con&s;ti|tute &s;ome Idea to direct a following Operation; but the Idea of the Almighty is the Model or Pattern, which fir&s;t
<PB N="190" REF="005500_0193_103964CF22E63FF8">
exi&s;ts, according to which, Things in Time are exactly form'd, which Idea as it is ab&s;oloutely con&s;idered in Rela|tion to God, is but one, becau&s;e it is his E&s;&s;ence; but as it is con&s;idered re&s;pectively, it is manifold, becau&s;e it denotes many re&s;pects to the Creatures, &s;o that the Idea of one Creature, is not the Idea of another. Thus it appears that Things are known by God as they are, and that there is a Connexion and Dependance among the divine Ideas. Whence &s;prings the Order of Prior and Po&s;terior, which we ob&s;erve in Prede&s;tination and Providence? It is doubtle&s;s on the Account of the Manifoldne&s;s of the divine Idea, in the former Sen&s;e, that his Knowledge receives various Names; in re&s;pect of the <HI>Truth</HI> of Things, 'tis call'd <HI>Know|ledge,</HI> in re&s;pect of its <HI>Extent,</HI> 'tis call'd Omni&s;cience, in re&s;|pect of <HI>Pa&s;t Things</HI> 'tis calld <HI>Remembrance. (P&s;al.</HI> xxv. 6, 7.) In re&s;pect of pre&s;ent Things <HI>Sight. (Heb.</HI> iv. 13.) In re&s;|pect of future Things <HI>Fore-Knowledge. (Rom.</HI> viii. 29.) In re&s;pect of the <HI>divine</HI> ordering of Things to a good <HI>End,</HI> 'tis called <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> in re&s;pect of the Knowledge of the mo&s;t fit and proper Sea&s;ons for all Things, it is call'd <HI>Prudence.</HI> But</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The Knowledge of God is <HI>immutable,</HI> he knows not one Thing more than another, neither does he know Things more now than formerly, or more formerly than now; be|cau&s;e he beholds all Things in his immutable E&s;&s;ence or Pur|po&s;es, and in his Eternity, by which he exi&s;ts without any Succe&s;&s;ion in Duration, altogether unmov'd in all the differ|ent Periods of Time.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The Knowledge of God is <HI>Infinite</HI> perfect and di&s;tinct, he knows all Things without Su&s;picion of Igno|rance or Error. His Knowledge is di&s;tinct and particular, not confus'd and general. Hence it is &s;aid, that when he had fini&s;hed the Works of Creation, that he &s;aw every Thing, <HI>and behold it was very good,</HI> that is, &s;uited to an&s;wer
<PB N="191" REF="005500_0194_103964CD8355AB10">
the End intended for them, agreeable to the Idea or Plan re&s;pecting them, which was from Everla&s;ting in his own Mind. Be&s;ides the Knowledge of God is <HI>certain and infallible,</HI> without any He&s;itation or Po&s;&s;ibility of Mi&s;take: And therefore exceedingly differs from the Knowledge of Creatures, who can but gue&s;s and conjecture at Things to come, according to the pre&s;ent Appearances, and probable Tendency of Things. This la&s;t Property of <HI>the divine Know|ledge</HI> naturally leads to the 4th propos'd, which was to point to the various <HI>Objects</HI> of the Knowledge of God, the Con|&s;ideration of which will be a farther Confirmation of it's in|finite Extent, by an Induction of Particulars. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. God knows <HI>him&s;elf</HI> and his <HI>own infinite Mind.</HI> viz. What he has done, can do, or will do. <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 34. <HI>For who hath known the Mind of the Lord, and who hath been his Coun&s;ellor, or who hath fir&s;t given to him?</HI> Here it is &s;up|pos'd, that tho' Creatures know not the Mind of God, yet he does him&s;elf, and of him&s;elf, without A&s;&s;i&s;tance from others. Seeing it is an Excellency in an intelligent Crea|ture to know him&s;elf, tho' but in an imperfect Degree, therefore &s;elf Knowledge in the highe&s;t degree of Eminence, mu&s;t be a&s;crib'd to the Almighty, who is infinitely perfect, and if &s;o, then the Almighty mu&s;t needs know all Things, be|cau&s;e they are included in his Power and Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. God knows all Things <HI>po&s;&s;ible.</HI> As the Power of God is unlimited, he certainly can do infinitely more than he does, or will do. This extent of his Power he mu&s;t needs know, becau&s;e he knows him&s;elf, the Almighty can do all Things that do not involve a Contradiction, <HI>e. g.</HI> He could create, if he plea&s;ed, Millions of Worlds, and Millions of more Orders of Creatures in them than there be in this! We our &s;elves, as free Agents, can do more than we do, and as intelligent Agents we know the In&s;tances where|in:
<PB N="192" REF="005500_0195_103964CBDC3659E0">
And how much more mu&s;t this be a&s;crib'd to God, who is infinite in Power, and calls the Things that are not as tho' they were? When <HI>David</HI> enquired of God 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxiii. 12. <HI>Will</HI> Saul <HI>come down, and will the Men of</HI> Keilah <HI>deliver me up? The Almighty an&s;wered they will.</HI> Which &s;ignifies that the Almighty knew they would, except they had been prevented by his Providence. This Knowledge of Things po&s;&s;ible, is call'd by <HI>Zanchy</HI> and others
<Q>The Science of &s;imple Intelligence.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Almighty knows all Things that have been, are, or &s;hall be. This is call'd <HI>the Science of Vi&s;ion,</HI> which re&s;pects the Exi&s;tence of Things, And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Almighty knows <HI>all Things pa&s;t,</HI> for they were once pre&s;ent, nay they may be &s;aid, in propriety of Speech, to be now pre&s;ent to God, becau&s;e he has no Succe&s;&s;ion in Duration, one Day is with him as a Thou&s;and Years, and a Thou&s;and Years as one Day. To &s;uppo&s;e that the Almighty forgets any Thing, is in other Words to &s;ay that his Know|ledge is le&s;s perfect than it was, which cannot con&s;i&s;t with infinite Perfection. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. God knows all Things <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> which the Rea&s;ons before offered to prove the Infinity of his Knowledge &s;uffi|ciently confirm. Seeing all Things depend upon his Power and Providence, they mu&s;t be known by him, for his Know|ledge and Power cannot be &s;eparated.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. God likewi&s;e knows <HI>all things future,</HI> or to come, whether they are produced by a nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;e, &s;uch as Fire or Water; or a voluntary Cau&s;e, &s;uch as Men who act by rational Complacency, or a contingent Cau&s;e, which by its Nature, or in it Self, is not determin'd to this or that Effect. The many Prophe&s;ies of the Prophets concerning Events, many Ages before they came to pa&s;s, &s;ufficiently confirm this Truth. It was well ob&s;erv'd by <HI>Tertullian</HI>
<PB N="193" REF="005500_0196_103964CA5591C250">
again&s;t <HI>Marcion,</HI> <Q>That the fore Knowledge of God, has as many Witne&s;&s;es, as he has made Prophets.</Q> Was not <HI>Ju|das</HI>'s betraying our Lord an Effect of a voluntary or free Cau&s;e? And yet this was prophe&s;ied of. (<HI>John</HI> vi. ult. <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 28.) Of the like nature was <HI>I&s;raels</HI> Oppre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and yet this was foretold Four Hundred Years before it came to pa&s;s. (<HI>Gen.</HI> xv. 13.) Was not <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Advancement a contingent and very improbable Event, and yet it was made known &s;everal Years before it came to pa&s;s by his Dream. (<HI>Gen.</HI> xxxvii. 5.) What could be more contingent than <HI>Ahab</HI>'s Death by a Random-&s;hot, and yet this was foretold before he entred the Field of Battle. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> xxii. 17, 34. Things are &s;aid to be contingent and accidental, becau&s;e they happen or come to pa&s;s unexpectedly to us, without our De&s;ign or Knowledge, and becau&s;e the Cau&s;es that produce them, are not in them&s;elves nece&s;&s;arily deter|min'd to produce &s;uch an Effect; but nothing can come to pa&s;s without <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s Cognizance, and Purpo&s;e.

He knows the Imaginati|on of the Thoughts of the Heart. Gen. vi. 5. <HI>And God &s;aw that the Wickedne&s;s of Man was great on the Earth, and that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only Evil continually.</HI> By the Imagination of the Thoughts, we may under&s;tand Thoughts in their Embryo not fully form'd.

<P N="1">1&s;t. The <HI>divine Wi&s;dom</HI> may be thus de&s;crib'd, <HI>viz.

<HI>Science.</HI> The 2d. is <HI>Knowledge</HI> how to <HI>order</HI> and <HI>di&s;po&s;e of Things</HI> in the be&s;t Manner, and to the be&s;t End, which is call'd <HI>Prudence.</HI> Tho' Wi&s;dom nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e. Knowledge, yet it contains more than Knowledge; for there may be but little Wi&s;dom where there is much Knowledge, tho' there can be no Wi&s;dom without Know|ledge! <Q>Knowledge, <HI>as Dr.</HI> Ridgely <HI>well ob&s;erves,</HI> is as it were the Eye of the Soul, whereby it apprehends or &s;ees Things in a true Light, and &s;o it is oppos'd to Ignorance, or not knowing Things; but Wi&s;dom is that whereby the Soul is directed in the &s;kilful Management of Things, or in ordering them for the be&s;t. And this is oppos'd not &s;o much to Ignorance or Error of Judgment, as to Folly, or Error in Conduct, which is a defect of Wi&s;dom.</Q> In Wi&s;dom therefore there are the&s;e four <HI>Ingredients, viz.</HI> 1&s;t. A <HI>fixing upon</HI> the noble&s;t <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly, A <HI>Choice of</HI> the be&s;t <HI>Means, viz.</HI> Such as directly conduce to attain the End de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, An <HI>alloting</HI> of the <HI>fitte&s;t Sea&s;on</HI> for the U&s;e of the afore&s;aid Means, together with the Ob&s;ervation thereof.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, A. <HI>Fore&s;ight of,</HI> and <HI>Provi&s;ion again&s;t all</HI> &s;uch <HI>Occur|ences,</HI> as may mar our Attainment of the End propos'd, or offer Occa&s;ion for unea&s;y Sen&s;ations, on the Account of Mi&s;management! Now every of the afore&s;aid <HI>Ingredients</HI> are truly applicable to <HI>Jehovah:</HI> For 1&s;t. he hath fix'd upon the be&s;t End in all his Works, <HI>viz. His own Glory.</HI> Hence it is &s;aid <HI>that he made all Things for him&s;elf,</HI> Pro. xvi. 4. But here it may be enquired, what is the <HI>Glory</HI> of God? And how does it appear to be the be&s;t End?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The <HI>Glory</HI> of God may be thus de&s;crib'd, <HI>viz. That is the Brightne&s;s of his infinite Eminence known and manife&s;ted.</HI> But how does this appear to be the be&s;t End?</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="005500_0204_1039660CC3805CC0"><HI>An&s;w.</HI> As God him&s;elf is the be&s;t Being, the Manife&s;ta|tion of him&s;elf, mu&s;t by Con&s;equence be the mo&s;t excellent and noble End! And what is this but his declarative Glo|ry? Seeing that Creatures are deriv'd from him as their producing Cau&s;e, it is but rea&s;onable that they &s;hould be referr'd to him, or his Glory as their End. Hence &s;aith the <HI>Apo&s;tle, for of him, and thro' him, and to him are all Things!</HI> But &s;eeing that God is of him&s;elf, he can have no other final Cau&s;e but him&s;elf. If he had any other Supream End but his own Glory, he would aim ultimately at &s;omething below him&s;elf, which is ab&s;ur'd, and depend on &s;omething be&s;ides him&s;elf, which is impo&s;&s;ible. From what has been &s;aid it is evident, that the fir&s;t Character or Ingredient of Wi&s;dom, <HI>viz.</HI> a fixing upon the noble&s;t End, is ju&s;tly applicable to Almighty God. I proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">2d. Which was the <HI>Choice</HI> of the <HI>be&s;t Means</HI> directly con|ducing to attain the End de&s;ign'd. Now that this is ap|plicable to God, will appear by the following Particulars. 1&s;t. <HI>Jehovah</HI> hath made his Glory manife&s;t or vi&s;ible, by engraving large and legible Characters thereof in his Word and Works, in both which we may ea&s;iy di&s;cern many Foot|&s;teps or Signatures of his adorable Attributes! Now with|out this Manife&s;tation, however Infinite and Tran&s;cendent, the e&s;&s;ential Emminence or Perfection of God might be, yet it would not be perceived or celebrated by Creatures. And,</P>
<P N="2">2dly, God hath made intelligent Creatures capable thro' his A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Influence to perceive, acknowledge, and honour his Excellency and Glory, manife&s;ted as afore&s;aid. Tho' irrational and inanimate Creatures may objectively glori|fy God. In this re&s;pect it is &s;aid that <HI>the Heavens and Earth do &s;hew forth God's Glory, i. e.</HI> They offer Occa&s;ion to in|teligent Beings to magnify God's Name, by &s;hewing the
<PB N="202" REF="005500_0205_1039640BAB9FA5F8">
Power and other Perfections of God apparent in their Pro|duction. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.20. <HI>For the invi&s;ible Things of him, from the Creation of the World are clearly &s;een, being under|&s;tood by the Things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead; &s;o that they are without Excu&s;e.</HI> Yet none but intelligent Creatures can actively and with De&s;ign, Glorify God. And</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Becau&s;e &s;ome are either &s;o Stupid or Negligent, that they cannot or will not, in a way of rea&s;oning, infer his Perfections from his Works; therefore the Almighty has implanted a <HI>Monitor</HI> in Mens Bo&s;oms to inform them of their Duty, and repre&s;ent the Danger of Neglect in the mo&s;t convincing Manner. Hence it is &s;aid that the <HI>Heathens</HI> not having the Law, <HI>i. e.</HI> The <HI>moral Law</HI> written, were a <HI>Law</HI> unto them&s;elves: Their Con&s;ciences in the mean Time accu&s;ing or excu&s;ing one another. And</P>
<P N="4">4thly, To add <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Force</HI> to the In&s;tructions and Admonitions of Con&s;cience, and to enlarge our views of his Attributes, more ob&s;curely repre&s;ented by his Works! <HI>Jehovah</HI> has added his Word, <HI>which he hath magnified above all his Name.</HI> But to proceed, the</P>
<P N="3">3d, Ingredient of Wi&s;dom is likew&s;e applicable to the Almighty, for he hath appointed to every thing its Time and Sea&s;on, and made them beautiful therein: All his Ways are Judgment, calculated in every of their Circum|&s;tances with the deepe&s;t Penetration! (<HI>Deut.</HI> xxxii. 4.) And</P>
<P N="4">4thly, He hath guarded again&s;t all adver&s;e Occurrences, by his eternal and unalterable Purpo&s;es; his Almighty power and &s;overeign Providence, which pre&s;ide over all Events: So that the Wrath of Man &s;hall be con&s;train'd to prai&s;e him. He will in the I&s;&s;ue get him&s;elf Glory from all his Creatures, either in an <HI>objective, Active,</HI> or <HI>pa&s;ive Way.</HI> His Mercy or Ju&s;tice will have a Tribute of Honour

from all the intelligent Creation, either in their Salvation or Damnation! But I proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to &s;peak of the <HI>Kinds</HI> of <HI>divine Wi&s;dom:</HI> Now the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of God is twofold, <HI>viz. E&s;&s;en|tial</HI> and <HI>Per&s;onal,</HI> the <HI>per&s;onal Wi&s;dom</HI> of God is our Lord JESUS CHRIST, he is call'd <HI>the Wi&s;dom of God,</HI> by way of Appropriation, on Account of his mediatorial Office: Becau&s;e herein the <HI>divine Wi&s;dom</HI> has been mo&s;t marve|lou&s;ly manife&s;ted, <HI>In him,</HI> as Mediator for his Peoples Benefit, <HI>are hid all the Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge,</HI> Col. ii. 3. The <HI>e&s;&s;ential Wi&s;dom</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is what is Common to all the Per&s;ons of the &s;acred Trinity, and is the Subject of our pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e. I pa&s;s on therefore to the</P>
<P N="3">3d. Propos'd, which was to mention the Properties or Qualities of divine Wi&s;dom. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It is <HI>Infinite</HI> as our Text a&s;&s;erts, <HI>O the Depth of the Wi&s;dom and Knowledge of God, how un&s;earchable are his Judg|ments, and his Ways pa&s;t finding out!</HI> It mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be Infinite, becau&s;e it is him&s;elf.</P>

<P N="5">5thly. He is <HI>immutable Wi&s;dom,</HI> and hence he is call'd the <HI>Father of Lights, with whom there is no Variablene&s;s nor Shadow of turning.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2dly. Is not the <HI>Wi&s;dom of God di&s;play'd</HI> in the <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Redemption</HI> mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly, even to the ju&s;t A&s;toni&s;hment of Men and Angels? Hence the Apo&s;tle calls it the <HI>mani|fold Wi&s;dom of God,</HI> Eph. iii. 10. <HI>(polupocilos Sophia)</HI> This the Angels de&s;ire to look into! <HI>Divine Wi&s;dom</HI> has found out a Way to &s;atisfy <HI>divine Ju&s;tice,</HI> which was wrong'd by the Creatures revolt from God, thro' the Sufferings of a Mediator in their Room; a <HI>Way</HI> to magnify the Law, and
<PB N="206" REF="005500_0209_103966061DB63380">
make it honourable by the perfect Obedience of the Son of God in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors Place: Hereby both the Precept and Penalty of the Law are fully an&s;wered, and a Door opened for the Manife&s;tation of <HI>rich, pure</HI> and <HI>glorious</HI> Grace, in the Remi&s;&s;ion and Salvation of fallen Mankind, without infringing upon the Rights of Ju&s;tice, Truth and Holine&s;s: Surely &s;uch a Devi&s;e as this, would have nonplus'd all the Creation. What le&s;s than <HI>infinite Wi&s;dom</HI> could bring the greate&s;t Glory to God, and the greate&s;t Good to Mankind out of the greate&s;t Evil, <HI>viz.</HI> Sin? Both which are directly contrary to the Nature of it! And this indeed is the true State of the Ca&s;e; for as it is certain that Believers are now upon a more &s;ure Founda|tion, re&s;pecting their Happine&s;s, than our fir&s;t Parents were before the Fall; becau&s;e their Stock is now in the Hands of the Mediator, which was before in their own, &s;o we cannot &s;ee how the Grace and Mercy of God could have had &s;uch marvelous and bright Di&s;plays, had not Sin been in the World! Thus out of the Eater <HI>divine Wi&s;dom</HI> hath brought forth Meat, and out of the Strong, Sweetne&s;s. It might be here likewi&s;e ob&s;erved, that the deferring of the Me&s;&s;ias coming in the Fle&s;h for a long Space of Time, is no incon&s;iderable Di&s;covery of divine Wi&s;dom: For hereby Room was given for the Tryal and Exerci&s;e of the Faith and Patience of God's People, in depending on his Word, and waiting for the Accompli&s;hment thereof; for thus was <HI>Jehovah</HI> glorify'd, Heb. xi. 13. <HI>The&s;e all died in Faith, not having received the Promi&s;es, but having &s;een them afar off, and were per&s;waded of them, and embraced them, and con|fe&s;&s;ed that they were Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth.</HI> And indeed the Time of our Lords coming was mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable; for then the Darkne&s;s of Impiety mo&s;t dread|fully prevail'd, and real Religion langui&s;h'd, and had al|mo&s;t
<PB N="207" REF="005500_0210_10396604799A8948">
totally expir'd. It was proper therefore that then <HI>the Day &s;pring from on High &s;hould vi&s;it a benighted World, and the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;e upon them to turn away Un|godline&s;s from</HI> Jacob!</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is al&s;o wonderfully <HI>di&s;play'd</HI> in his <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Prividence!</HI> in Relation to the World in general, and to his Church and People in particular.</P>
<P>The in&s;en&s;ible Parts of the Creation are conducted by divine Providence to an End which they know not. The Sun ob&s;erves his &s;tated Periods of ri&s;ing and &s;etting, and runs his wonted Round to enlighten and animate this low|er Globe, and the Stars with exact Order atten'd their &s;everal Motions, many irrational Animals act with a Di&s;|cretion, like that of intelligent Beings, Jer. viii. 7. <HI>The Stork in the Heaven knoweth her appointed Times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow ob&s;erve the Time of their coming. The Ant by prudent indu&s;try, lays up her Winter Store before it's Approach!</HI></P>
<P>What el&s;e than a wi&s;e and watchful Providence keeps the whole Sy&s;tem of Things in its proper Situation, &s;o that the Elements do not break Loo&s;e and de&s;troy each other? And what but this bounds the Wrath of &s;avage Men, and makes it turn to the divine Prai&s;e? But more particularly in Relation to the Church of God, how mar|velou&s;ly has the Wi&s;dom of God appear'd in his Provi|dence?</P>
<P>In the Time of the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> while Men liv'd a long Space, God was plea&s;ed to in&s;truct his People by immediate Revelation and Tradition; but when the Lives of Men were much contracted, and there was Danger, on that Account of the Corruption of Tradition, it plea&s;ed God to communicate his Mind and Will to his People by Writing; which is a Method le&s;s liable to the afore&s;aid
<PB N="208" REF="005500_0211_10396602F4BC0000">
Inconvenience. Moreover in the written Word, the Almigh|ty in&s;tructed his Church <HI>gradually</HI> in the Knowledge of the Go&s;pel, fir&s;t more ob&s;curely by Types and Shadows; and afterwards more plainly by a clearer Revelation: Thus the Almighty treated them like Children, as they were able to bear it!</P>
<P>And doubtle&s;s the <HI>harder</HI> and <HI>more co&s;tly Services</HI> re|quired, under the <HI>Jewi&s;h Oeconomy,</HI> tended to make Men long for, and more eagerly embrace an ea&s;ier Di&s;pen&s;ation!</P>
<P>But the Wi&s;dom of God in his Providence towards his Church, has appear'd in nothing more eminently than in baffling the Contrivances and Attempts of her Enemies, and in turning them to her Advantage! A noble In&s;tance of this we read of in the Book of <HI>E&s;ter,</HI> when <HI>Haman</HI> had cruelly devis'd the utter Ruin of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church and Nation, and had brought his malicious Plot almo&s;t to the fatal Period of Execution! How admirably was it fru&s;trated, and the Tables turn'd in his own overthrow? While poor <HI>Mordecai,</HI> the Mark of his ambitious Rage, was honour'd and protected, and the Church e&s;tabli&s;h'd! The Incident that led to this &s;urprizing Revolution of Af|fairs, was truly a&s;toni&s;hing, <HI>viz.</HI> The King's Re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s one Night, and reading in the Book of the <HI>Chronicles</HI> of <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s Services to the Kingdom!</P>
<P>And indeed in all Ages it has pleas'd the all-wi&s;e God to make Per&s;ecution of Service to his Church, &s;o that there is good Ground for that antient and common Proverb, that <HI>The Blood of the Martyrs, is the &s;eed of the Church:</HI> But in Particular the Per&s;ecution at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> is a memora|ble In&s;tance of this Kind, for the Chri&s;tians being thereby di&s;pers'd, were Means of &s;preading the Go&s;pel far and wide! And did not <HI>I&s;rael's</HI> Oppre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Egypt,</HI> prepare the Way for their happy Deliverance, by making them
<PB N="209" REF="005500_0212_103966015090FB68">
more de&s;irous after it, and more ready to embrace the Call of God, in abandoning their Captivity?</P>
<P>And that I may &s;ay many Things in one, was not Satan and his In&s;truments over&s;hot, in their own Bow, in re|&s;pect of the Crucifiction of Chri&s;t? What they de&s;ign'd for Evil, has not God's Wi&s;dom turn'd to the greate&s;t Good? By <HI>Death, Life</HI> is brought to Believers, by the bittere&s;t <HI>Pain,</HI> the &s;weete&s;t <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> and by the <HI>ba&s;e&s;t Ignominy,</HI> the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Honour!</P>
<P>An immemorial In&s;tance of the Wi&s;dom of God, in his Providence in compa&s;&s;ing a noble End, by contrary Means, we have re&s;pecting <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> his being &s;old to the <HI>I&s;hmalites,</HI> and impri&s;on'd in <HI>Egypt,</HI> were Occa&s;ions introductory to his exalted Dominion over that Nation; and this the Occa&s;ion of his Father's Family coming and re&s;iding there, and &s;o of the fulfilment of the Prophe&s;ies, re&s;pecting <HI>I&s;raels</HI> abode in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and Deliverance out of it, in after Time. The Wheels of Providence are full of Eyes. It may be truly &s;aid of them, that <HI>(Non ceco impetu volvunter rote.)</HI> the Wheels of Providence are not govern'd by blind Chance. But the Time will not &s;erve to relate any more In&s;tances. I there|fore proceed to the <HI>Improvement</HI> of this Subject And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Con&s;ideration of the divine Wi&s;dom &s;hould ex|cite us to Mode&s;ty in our Meditations upon the Difficul|ties which we &s;ometimes meet with in God's Word and Works! Tho' the My&s;teries of Faith do not contradict human Rea&s;on, yet they in &s;ome In&s;tances tran&s;cend its Reach! And there be &s;ometimes ob&s;cure Texts in the Pro|vidence of God too difficult for us to &s;olve. The <HI>Almigh|ty walks &s;ometimes in the great Deep, and his Foot&s;teps are not known, he makes Darkne&s;s his Pavilion, and hides the Face of his Throne!</HI> In this Ca&s;e let us con&s;ider, <HI>that the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of God is wi&s;er than Men,</HI> and cry out with the
<PB N="210" REF="005500_0213_103965FF8F72E908">
Apo&s;tle in our Text, <HI>O the Depth of the Riches of the Wi&s;|dom and Knowledge of God, how un&s;earchable are his Judg|ments, and his Ways pa&s;t finding out?</HI> Let us beware of call|ing the divine Wi&s;dom to the Bar of our Rea&s;on, with the <HI>Socinians,</HI> 1 Cor. iii. 18. <HI>If any Man among you &s;eemeth to be wi&s;e in this World, let him become a Fool that he may be wi&s;e.</HI> Not a Fool really, with <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> who reject all u&s;e of Rea&s;on in Religion, but <HI>a Fool in his own Eyes,</HI> i. e. Let him be <HI>humble</HI> under a <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> of his Folly and Weakne&s;s, and reject all Dependance upon his own Under|&s;tanding. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. This Subject learns us the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of Con|tentment in every change of Circum&s;tance, &s;eeing the In|finitely wi&s;e God knows be&s;t what is be&s;t for us. If we were left to our own Choice, we &s;hould certainly ruin our|&s;elves, with what calm Confidence &s;hould we then com|mit our Way to God, that he may bring it to pa&s;s. And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Wi&s;dom of God offers <HI>Food for our Faith,</HI> and <HI>Comfort</HI> to our Souls under the darke&s;t Appearances of divine Providence re&s;pecting the Church. We are &s;ure that he is the Ruler, and that he rules in Wi&s;dom, nothing hap|pens be&s;ides his Purpo&s;e, or without his Providence. He can make the mo&s;t contrary Things promote his Kingdoms Good, as was ob&s;erv'd before, and he has promis'd that he will do &s;o. (<HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 28.) And el&s;ewhere he has &s;aid, that <HI>no Weapon form'd again&s;t</HI> Zion, <HI>&s;hall pro&s;per.</HI> Then let us re&s;ign our Wi&s;dom and Wills to God, let us believingly com|mit the Affairs of God's Kingdom into the Mediators Hands, and expect the fulfilment of his Word.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Is God's Wi&s;dom di&s;play'd in his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Works?</HI> Then let us <HI>meditate</HI> on them, with more fre|quency and Care, and a&s;cribe to God the Glory of that
<PB N="211" REF="005500_0214_103965FDCA09CB30">
Wi&s;dom which appears in them, in the Sentiments of our Minds, by the Speeches of our Lips, and the Actions of our Lives. It is a ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, That the Works of the Lord are great, &s;ought out of all tho&s;e that have Plea&s;ure therein.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly. Is God Infinite in Wi&s;dom? Then 1&s;t. <HI>Let us ask</HI> Wi&s;dom <HI>of him who giveth to all Men liberally and up|braideth not, and it &s;hall be given us.</HI> Jam. i. 5. And 2dly. Let us according to our Mea&s;ure <HI>imitate the divine VVi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. By <HI>fixing</HI> upon an <HI>End,</HI> in the Enjoyment of which we may be compleatly happy, <HI>viz.</HI> God's Glory and the Enjoyment of him. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. By the <HI>Choice</HI> of <HI>proper Means</HI> tending to that End, &s;uch as Faith, Repentance and Holine&s;s, <HI>as God is Holy,</HI> &s;o tho&s;e that expect to enjoy him, mu&s;t be like him.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. By <HI>improving</HI> the <HI>pre&s;ent Sea&s;ons,</HI> in the u&s;e of the afore&s;aid Means. This is the Command of God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 1, 2. <HI>VVe then as VVorkers together with him, be&s;eech you al&s;o that ye receive not the Grace of God in vain. (For he &s;aith, I have heard thee in a Time accepted, and in the Day of Salvation have I &s;uccoured thee: Behold, now is the accepted Time; behold now is the Day of Salvation.)</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>this</HI> we &s;hould be excited likewi&s;e, by con&s;idering the Shortne&s;s and Uncertainty of our Time and its Op|portunities, together with the va&s;t Moment that depends upon the Improvement thereof. And</P>
<P N="4">4thly. We &s;hould guard again&s;t every Appearance of Evil, that tends to ob&s;truct us in the <HI>Pur&s;uit</HI> of our chief End. The very contrary to the afore&s;aid Particulars, con&s;titutes the Folly of the ungodly World. They either fix upon &s;ome Enjoyment here as their chief End, or if
<PB N="212" REF="005500_0215_103965FC44CFB468">
they pretend a higher End, take contrary Mea&s;ures to at|tain it. They neglect the pre&s;ent Sea&s;ons of Mercy, <HI>with the Fool they have a Price in their Hand, but no Heart to it. They likewi&s;e ru&s;h into Places of Temptation, and &s;o are ea&s;ily en&s;nared, and &s;ell their Salvation for a Thing of Nought.</HI></P>

<P>And when <HI>Abram</HI> was Ninety Years old and Nine, the Lord appeared to <HI>Abram,</HI> and &s;aid unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the Words of our Text, we have a Summary of the Gracious Covenant, God was pleas'd to make with <HI>Abram</HI> of old, containing the&s;e two Things following, which de&s;erve our Notice, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. What God's Covenant People may <HI>expect him to be to them,</HI> in the&s;e Words, <HI>I am the Almighty God. (El&s;hadai)</HI> <Q>This is the Name of God, (<HI>&s;ays Mr.</HI> Henery <HI>in his Annota|tions</HI>) that is mo&s;tly us'd throughout the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> at lea&s;t thirty Times in the Di&s;cour&s;es of that Book, in which <HI>Jehovah</HI> is us'd but once.</Q> This Name (as Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> in his <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> and other learned Men ob&s;erve) &s;ignifies the Strength &amp; Sufficiency of God, <Q>It &s;peaks (&s;ays <HI>Henery</HI>) the Almighty Power of God, either as an Avenger, or as a Bene|factor, but it &s;hould be e&s;pecially taken in the Latter Sen&s;e.</Q> as <HI>Dru&s;ius</HI> and others ob&s;erve. In which it &s;ignifies God's <HI>Self-Sufficiency,</HI> and <HI>All-Sufficiency.</HI> He is able to perform all that he hath &s;aid, re&s;pecting his People, he hath enough in him&s;elf, and of him&s;elf, for him&s;elf and for them; he hath all Things, and needeth nothing to compleat his own Perfection and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and is able to confer on us a Hap|pine&s;s,

as large as our De&s;ires, and as la&s;ting as our Souls. And therefore this Word, &s;eems to be better rendred in the old Engli&s;h <HI>Ver&s;ion,</HI> than in the pre&s;ent: For there it is thus expre&s;s'd. <HI>I am God all &s;ufficient.</HI> But</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Words of our Text inform us, what God <HI>ex|pects</HI> or <HI>requires</HI> his <HI>People to be to him.</HI> And this is ex|pre&s;s'd in two Particulars, <HI>viz. Walking before him,</HI> and in <HI>being perfect. Walk before me.</HI> This Word by a Metaphor intends Men's Lives and Actions, (<HI>P&s;.</HI> i. 1.) Becau&s;e there is &s;ome Analogy or Re&s;emblance between them, and a na|tural Way. <HI>Before me,</HI> i. e. Under a continual Sen&s;e of my Pre&s;ence and Cognizance, as a Servant before his Lord. <HI>And be thou perfect. Simmachus</HI> renders the Word <HI>perfect,</HI> blamele&s;s, but according to the mo&s;t of Interpreters, it &s;ignifies, Sincerity or Freedom from Deceit and Guile; and in this Sen&s;e it is a&s;crib'd to <HI>Abram, Noah, David</HI> and <HI>Job. (Gen.</HI> vi. 9. <HI>P&s;.</HI> xviii. 23. <HI>Job</HI> i. 1.) That is perfect in the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI>'s Judgment, which hath all its Parts, tho' it be not perfect in Degrees. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 17. <HI>That the Man of God, may be perfect thoroughly furni&s;hed to all good Works.</HI> And &s;uch as are more advanc'd in Knowledge and Holine&s;s than others, are call'd perfect <HI>comparatively. Phil.</HI> iii. 15. <HI>Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded.</HI> God Al|mighty therefore does not covenant with <HI>Abram,</HI> for an en|tire Perfection of Degrees, as the Papi&s;ts dream, who are herein follow'd by the whole Tribe of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts; but he requires a Perfection of Parts, or Sincerity. <HI>viz.</HI> That he &s;hould endeavour to conform his Practice, to all Parts of the divine Law, without Guile or re&s;erve. <Q>I know no Religi|on (&s;aid excellent Mr. <HI>Mathew Henery</HI>) but <HI>Sincerity.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing upon this Text I &s;hall &s;peak upon the three following Heads, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<PB N="215" REF="005500_0218_103965F707D4A768">
<ITEM>I. The Sufficiency of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Walking before him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Sincerity.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And then apply the whole. The</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. General Head of Di&s;cour&s;e is God's <HI>Sufficiency, or All Sufficiency,</HI> which may be thus de&s;crib'd, <HI>viz. That it is a Perfection of the divine Nature whereby Johovah hath enough in him&s;elf, for him&s;elf, and for his People in every re|&s;pect.</HI> This re&s;ults from his Infinity in particular, as well as from his other Attributes in general, becau&s;e he exi&s;ted not by the Will of another, therefore he is independent and in|finite in his E&s;&s;ence and in all his Attributes and Being, &s;o he mu&s;t be con&s;equently perfect and all &s;ufficient. As his Simplicity a&s;&s;ures us, that he can admit nothing of ano|ther Kind, to perfect his Being, &s;o his Eternity informs us, that he was happy in him&s;elf, when there was none be&s;ides him. And &s;eeing all the Excellencies of Creatures are deriv'd from him, he mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame eminently in him|&s;elf, otherwi&s;e he could not confer them upon others. Hence is that Beautiful Pa&s;&s;age of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;.</HI> xxxvi. 10. <HI>With thee is the Fountain of Life, and in thy Light &s;hall we &s;ee Light. Theophilact</HI> glo&s;&s;eth pertinently upon this Place of Scripture in the following Manner. <Q>As the Sun <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> is alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> beheld full, and never le&s;&s;ened as the Moon, &s;o God always exi&s;ts perfect, full of Wi&s;dom, Power, Immor|tallity and all other good Things.</Q> And the Scriptures a&s;|&s;ert el&s;ewhere, <HI>that God is perfect,</HI> Mat. v. 48. <HI>Perfect in Wi&s;dom, Power, Beneficence, and that he needs Coun|cil or Help of none.</HI> Job. xxii. 2, 3 Rom. xi. 34, 35.</P>
<P>But that the afore&s;aid De&s;cription of God's Sufficiency may be the better under&s;tood, let the following Particulars be con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="216" REF="005500_0219_103965F583B6A348">1&s;t. That the general Nature of this Attribute is <HI>Fullne&s;s,</HI> or enough of Excellency and Good. This is a Perfection oppos'd to Emptine&s;s and Defect, and is attended with the following Properties. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It is an <HI>underiv'd Fullne&s;s</HI> Rom. xi. 35, 36. <HI>Who hath fir&s;t given to him, and it &s;hall be recompen&s;ed to him again, for of him, and through him, and to him are all Things.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is an <HI>independent Fullne&s;s:</HI> He hath no Depend|ance upon Creatures, neither can he receive any Good or Excellency from them, becau&s;e they have deriv'd their All from him. Now a Circulation of Cau&s;es and Effects is in the nature of Things impo&s;&s;ible. <HI>Our Good|ne&s;s extends not to him, neither is it any Gain to the Almigh|ty that we are righteous,</HI> &s;ayeth Job. <HI>Who hath made thee to differ from another,</HI> &s;ayeth the Apo&s;tle Paul? <HI>And what ha&s;t thou that thou did&s;t not receive?</HI> It was a noble &s;aying of the Pagan <HI>Lucretius,</HI> re&s;pecting the divine Nature.</P>

<Q><L><HI>Jehovah</HI>'s Wealth, does fully him &s;uffice,</L>
<L>Nor needs he, of his Creatures, a &s;upply.</L></Q>
<P N="3">3dly. It is a <HI>compleat</HI> and <HI>perfect Fullne&s;s,</HI> and that in three re&s;pects, <HI>viz.</HI> In regard of the Kinds, Degrees and Duration of all po&s;&s;ible Excellency and Good. And 1&s;t. the <HI>Fulne&s;s</HI> of God is Perfect in re&s;pect of the <HI>Kinds</HI> of Excellency, for the Almighty hath in him, not only all tho&s;e Excellencies, the Shadow of which is in created Be|ings, &s;uch as <HI>Wi&s;dom, Power, Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s, Truth.</HI> But he hath al&s;o &s;uch Excellency's in his Nature as there are no Foot&s;teps or re&s;emblance of in Creatures, <HI>e. g.

The <HI>Fullne&s;s</HI> of God is compleat and perfect in re&s;pect of <HI>Duration,</HI> the Excellencies of Creatures are Qua|lities di&s;tinct from, and added to their Beings, and may be therefore &s;eperated and extingui&s;hed, while their Beings are pre&s;erved, as appears by the doleful Apo&s;tacy of the Angels and our fir&s;t Parents. If their Beings them&s;elves, becau&s;e deriv'd and dependant, may be de&s;troy'd, how much more the good Properties that cleave thereto? But the Full|ne&s;s of God is the very &s;ame with his Being, and there|fore in&s;eparable and eternal! He and he only is, <HI>Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Truth.</HI> But to proceed</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The <HI>Fullne&s;s</HI> of God is <HI>Invariable,</HI> equally unca|pable of Addition or Diminution, he can receive nothing from without, becau&s;e he is already Infinite, and to that nothing can be added. And from whom &s;hould he re|ceive any Addition, it mu&s;t be from Creatures if at all; but they can give him nothing but what is his own, no|thing but what they received from him, Acts xvii. 25. <HI>Neither is he wor&s;hiped with Men's Hands, as tho' he needed any Thing, &s;eeing he giveth to all Life, and Breath, and all Things!</HI> And as the Fullne&s;s of God cannot be increa&s;ed, &s;o neither can it be impair'd by the &s;ordid Violence of Creatures! For as our Goodne&s;s does not extend to God to benefit him, &s;o neither can our Impieties do him a|ny real Injury, Job xxxv. 6, 7, 8, <HI>If thou &s;inne&s;t, what doe&s;t thou again&s;t him? Or if thy Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions be multiply'd,
<PB N="218" REF="005500_0221_103965F224C43B40">
what do&s;t thou unto him? If thou be Righteous what give&s;t thou him? Or what receiveth he of thine Hand? Thy Wicked|ne&s;s may hurt a Man, as thou art, and thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s may profit the Son of Man!</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly. The <HI>Fullne&s;s</HI> of God is <HI>Overflowing</HI> and <HI>Immen&s;e:</HI> He has more than enough for all created Beings, the Riches and Affluence thereof, not only exceeds all their Nece&s;&s;ities, but even their Thoughts and De&s;ires! Eph. iii. 20. <HI>Now unto him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we a&s;k or think.</HI> P&s;al. xxxvi. 8. <HI>They &s;hall be abundantly &s;atisfy'd with the Fatne&s;s of thy Hou&s;e, and thou &s;halt make them drink of the River of thy Plea&s;ures.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6thly. The <HI>Fullne&s;s</HI> of God is <HI>Everflowing</HI> and <HI>Inexhau&s;ta|ble:</HI> The Ci&s;terns of created Good may be drawn dry; but God is a Fountain that cannot be exhau&s;ted: He is the <HI>Alpha,</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the Beginning and the Ending from Everla&s;ting to Everla&s;ting, God. When Millions have drank of this Fountain the Streams are never the Le&s;s.</P>
<P>But the <HI>&s;pecial Nature</HI> of Gods <HI>Sufficiency</HI> appears in the&s;e two Particulars following, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. In that <HI>Jehovah</HI> hath enough in him&s;elf for him&s;elf, or his own Happine&s;s; In this re&s;pect he is call'd <HI>Self-Sufficient.</HI> That God is Happy, appears from the Character of <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed</HI> frequently a&s;crib'd to him in Scripture. What is Happine&s;s but the Enjoyment of a &s;ufficient Degree of Good, &s;uited to the Nature of the Being that enjoys it? Now it is certain the Almighty hath this, for he neither needeth, de&s;ireth, or can receive more than he has. Dependant Creatures need a foreign Support to &s;u&s;tain their borrow'd Beings; but he is independent and hath Life of him&s;elf, (<HI>Joh.</HI> v. 26) And therefore needs them not, neither doth he de&s;ire more Happine&s;s then he hath; for than he would be imperfect and &s;o no God. Before the Worlds Foundations were laid
<PB N="219" REF="005500_0222_103965F0A1733798">
he had Complai&s;ance in his own Glory and Perfection; neither did he make Creatures to increa&s;e his own Hap|pine&s;s, but of meer good Plea&s;ure: And as for Creatures acknowledging of his Excellency with Honour, it adds no more thereto than commending the Sun adds to its Lu&s;tre, or prai&s;ing a Fountain would increa&s;e its Streams, neither can the Almighty po&s;&s;ibly receive any more Happine&s;s than he hath becau&s;e of his Infinity. To confirm and il|lu&s;trate what has been now ob&s;erv'd let the following Places of Scripture be con&s;idered, P&s;. l. 9, 13. <HI>I will take no Bullock out of thy Hou&s;e, nor He-Goats out of thy Fold: For every Bea&s;t of the Fore&s;t is mine, and the Cattle upon a thou&s;and Hills. If I were Hungry I would not tell thee, for the World is mine and the Fullne&s;s thereof.</HI> And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Almighty hath enough for all his Creatures to make them compleatly Happy: <HI>I am the Almighty God.</HI> Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> in his <HI>Synop&s;is</HI> ob&s;erves <Q>The Original Word is deriv'd of a Root that &s;ignifies a Brea&s;t, becau&s;e he nouri&s;hes all, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on the Heathens re|pre&s;ented their <HI>Diana, I&s;is and Ceres</HI> after the &s;ame Manner.</Q> The Ability of God to make all his Crea|tures Happy, is ju&s;tly term'd by Divines, his All-Suffici|ency, and this in Relation to good People is &s;et forth by &s;everal &s;ignificant Emblems or Similitudes. Hence he is call'd a <HI>Sun</HI> (P&s;a. lxxxiv. 12.) As the Sun di&s;&s;ipates the Gloom of Night by his enlightning and warming Rays, and thereby &s;heds a Gladne&s;s over the Face of Things; thus the Almighty refre&s;heth his Peoples Hearts. The Lord is likewi&s;e call'd his Peoples Shield, P&s;a. lxxxiv. They are expos'd in this tumultuous Scene to a thick Succe&s;&s;ion of Dangers and Conflicts; but the Almighty protects them as by a Shield, <HI>He covers their Head in the Day of Battle. He that dwelleth in the &s;ecret Place of the mo&s;t High, &s;hall

He abundantly recompences all their Services and Sufferings for him; and hence he is call'd <HI>an exceeding great Reward,</HI> Gen. xv. i.

<P N="1">1&s;t.

<P N="2">2dly. There is enough in God to &s;atisfy the <HI>De&s;ires</HI> of his People here and hereafter, Jer. 31.14.

<P N="2">2d. General Head, which was to <HI>di&s;cour&s;e upon the Na|ture of walking before God,</HI> which may be thus de&s;crib'd, viz. <HI>That it is a friendly Conver&s;ation with God:</HI> Now this is expre&s;&s;ed by different Phra&s;es in Scripture, &s;ometimes it is call'd a <HI>walking before God,</HI> as in the Text, to &s;ignify the Sen&s;e that we &s;hould always have of God's Pre&s;ence upon our Minds. Sometimes a <HI>walking after God</HI> to im|port our Need of imitating his Example, and of ac|commodating our&s;elves to his various Dealings with us, whether Comfortable or Afflictive, (<HI>Deut.</HI> xiii. 4.) Some times it is call'd a <HI>walking with God,</HI> thus it is &s;aid of <HI>Enoch, that he walked with God;</HI> this Phra&s;e e&s;pecially intends that &s;weet Familiarity which pa&s;&s;es between God and holy Souls. Sometimes it is called a <HI>Walking in the Name of God, (Mica.</HI> iv. 5.) to &s;ignify that in all our religious Practice, we &s;hould have the divine Pre&s;cription for our <HI>Rule,</HI> and the divine Glo|ry for our <HI>Mark.</HI> Sometimes a <HI>Walking</HI> in the <HI>Spirit, (Gal.</HI> v. 16.) importing the Sen&s;e we &s;hould always have of our Need of the Guidance and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Gho&s;t to
<PB N="223" REF="005500_0226_103965E9EFE4B630">
the Performance of acceptable Service, as well as our intire Dependance thereupon. But more particularly</P>
<P>Walking before or with God, &s;uppo&s;es and implies the&s;e Things following, <HI>viz,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>Reconciliation</HI> to God by accepting the Mediator through Faith: <HI>For how &s;hall two walk together except they be agreed?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. It &s;uppo&s;es <HI>&s;piritual Life,</HI> infus'd by Regeneration, for a dead Man cannot walk.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> the <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> or Grace, by the quickning Operations of the Holy Spirit. A Man cannot walk that is a&s;leep. <HI>I will run the Ways of thy Command|ments</HI> &s;aid the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, when thou ha&s;t enlarged my Heart.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. It &s;uppo&s;es <HI>a Way</HI> in which, and this is twofold <HI>viz.</HI> either of God's <HI>Commands,</HI> or of his <HI>Providence,</HI> we mu&s;t obey the Former and accommodate our &s;elves to the Latter, <HI>i. e.</HI> When the Almighty frowns by Afflictions, we mu&s;t mourn, and when he &s;miles by Comforts communicated we mu&s;t rejoyce. And</P>
<P N="5">5thly. It &s;uppo&s;es an <HI>End</HI> to which, and this ought to be ever the &s;ame with what <HI>Jehovah</HI> intends, <HI>viz.</HI> The Mani|fe&s;tation of his Glory; and in Subordination thereto our own and our Neighbours Happine&s;s. <HI>Whether in eating or drinking or what&s;oever we do, we &s;hould do it all to the Glory of God.</HI> But</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Walking before or with God <HI>implies</HI> the&s;e follow|ing Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>Faith,</HI> he that walks with God, as well as comes to him, mu&s;t believe that he is. In walking with God, <HI>Faith</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary in three Re&s;pects. 1&s;t. As an <HI>Eye</HI> to behold the great Prophet of the Church, the Guide of our Way, without who&s;e Command we mu&s;t not move a Foot, in imi|tation of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in the De&s;art who &s;topp'd <HI>when the
<PB N="224" REF="005500_0227_103965E7E006CE88">
Pillar of a Cloud and of Fire did not go before them.</HI> 2dly. As a <HI>Conduit</HI> to convey Provi&s;ion and Refre&s;hment in our Jour|ney, without which we mu&s;t needs travel &s;lowly and heavily. 3dly. As a <HI>Hand</HI> to help us to lay hold of, and lean upon the dear Redeemer in our Walking. Hence it is with Admiration ob&s;erv'd concerning the Church, <HI>Cant.</HI> viii. 5. <HI>Who is this that cometh out of the Wilderne&s;s leaning upon the Beloved.</HI> Except we rely upon the Strength of God, we cannot walk with him. But</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Walking before God, implies <HI>Fear,</HI> our Minds &s;hould be continually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an awful Reverence of God's Maje&s;ty, as remembring the infinite Di&s;tance between him and us, in point of Dignity. Likewi&s;e we &s;hould be ever afraid of offending God, and humbly jea|lous of our own Hearts. Hence we are bid to <HI>&s;erve God acceptably with Reverence &amp; Godly Fear.</HI> Heb. xii. 28, 29. And hence is that divine Expo&s;tulation. <HI>Mal.</HI> i. 6. <HI>If I be a Ma&s;ter where is my Fear?</HI> And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It implies <HI>Love</HI> to God, and Familiarity with him thereby. Such as behold by Faith the Amiablene&s;s of the divine Maje&s;ty, and ta&s;te his Love, love him again with a &s;upream and tran&s;cendent re&s;pect! As Fear ballances Love &s;o Love &s;weetens Fear. <Q>Fear without Love would be a painful Pa&s;&s;ion (<HI>as Dr.</HI> Bates <HI>ju&s;tly ob&s;erves</HI>) and Love without Fear would degenerate into an effeminate Fondne&s;s.</Q> Now that Familiarity which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between God and Be|lievers by Love, contains in it the&s;e Things following, 1&s;t. <HI>mutal Vi&s;its,</HI> as God vi&s;its his People by his Grace, &s;o they vi&s;it him with Repentance, Prayers and Tears. (<HI>Jam.</HI> iv. 2.) <HI>Mutual Embraces, (Cant.</HI> i. 2, 3.) A <HI>mutual Communication</HI> of Secrets. God opens &s;ecret Things to them. Hence the Secret of the Lord is &s;aid to be with tho&s;e that fear him, (<HI>P&s;.</HI> xxv. 14.) And the People of God on the other Hand,
<PB N="225" REF="005500_0228_103965E659C6A5E8">
come to him, as a Father, and &s;ob after him <HI>Abba Fa|ther,</HI> and open to him all their Hearts. (<HI>P&s;.</HI> xlii. 4.) A <HI>mutual De&s;ire of Union</HI> and <HI>Cohabitation.</HI> Hence CHRIST ac|co&s;ts his Bride in the following Strains. <HI>Come with me from</HI> Lebanon <HI>my Si&s;ter my Spou&s;e, look from the Top of</HI> Amana, <HI>from the Top of</HI> Shenir <HI>and</HI> Hermon <HI>from the Lyons Dens and from the Mountains of Leopards.</HI> And the Spou&s;e on the o|ther Hand &s;ays, <HI>Come</HI> LORD JESUS <HI>come quickly; I de|&s;ire to he di&s;&s;olv'd and to be with</HI> CHRIST <HI>which is far better.</HI> 5thly. A <HI>friendly Con&s;ultation</HI> for Advice and Direction. Hence the dear Redeemer is call'd <HI>his Peoples Coun&s;ellor, be|cau&s;e he leads them by his Council, (I&s;a.</HI> ix. 6.) But</P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>Walking before or with God implies Pains</HI> and <HI>Labour,</HI> natural Walking, to which this alludes, is not with|out them, e&s;pecially if it be for a con&s;iderable Space. And hence we are bid to &s;trive <HI>to enter in at the &s;trait Gate, and work out our Salvation with fear and trembling.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly. It implies <HI>Progre&s;s,</HI> tho&s;e that walk in a natural Road make Progre&s;s, and thus tho&s;e that walk with God grow more humble, more weaned from this World, and more re&s;ign'd to God's Will, and it is doubtle&s;s in general their chief De&s;ire, and endeavour to grow in Grace, and when they find not thus, it is their principal Grief.</P>
<P N="6">6thly It implies <HI>Per&s;everance,</HI> for walking is not a &s;in|gle Act, but a Cour&s;e and Series of them, a continuance in our religious Diligence, until we come to the End of our Race, it is tho&s;e only who <HI>per&s;evere to the End, that &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> We <HI>&s;hould run &s;o as to obtain.</HI> But I proceed to the</P>
<P N="3">3d. General Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>viz. Sincerity,</HI> which may be thus de&s;crib'd, <HI>viz. That it is a divine Vertue,</HI> where|by we really are, <HI>what we &s;eem to be.</HI> Here an appearance
<PB N="226" REF="005500_0229_103965E496B53B80">
of Goodne&s;s is &s;uppos'd, and the&s;e Things following are in|tended, which con&s;titute <HI>Sincerity,</HI> viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That a Per&s;on labours to avoid all mixture of Cor|ruption and evil Intention; this is by our Lord call'd <HI>a &s;ingle Eye,</HI> and when Per&s;ons have this, then their <HI>whole Bodies are full of Light,</HI> i. e. they are in a gracious and comfortable State.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. When Per&s;ons habitually labour not only outward|ly, but chiefly inwardly, to be Holy contrary to the Practice of the Phari&s;ees, who <HI>clean&s;ed the out&s;ide of the Cup and Plat|ter while the In&s;ide was neglected.</HI> And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. When Men endeavour to be Holy, not only before Men, but chiefly before God, <HI>Colo&s;.</HI> iii. 22. <HI>Not with Eye Service as Men Plea&s;ers, but with &s;inglene&s;s of Heart fearing God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. When Men do not habitually neglect known Duty, and expect not their Reward from Men, but from God, thus it is &s;aid of <HI>Zachariah</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth, That they walk'd in all the Commandments of God blamele&s;s.</HI> It is likewi&s;e re|corded of <HI>Mo&s;es, (Heb.</HI> xi. 27.) That by Faith he for&s;ook <HI>Egypt,</HI> not fearing the Wrath of the King, for he endur'd, as &s;eeing him who is invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Sincerity</HI> is twofold, <HI>viz. Moral</HI> or <HI>Spiritual. Moral</HI> is that which &s;prings from Nature, poli&s;hed by a religious Education, together with re&s;training Grace; and principal|ly aims at our own Intere&s;t. Such an Integrity had the Pa|gan <HI>Abimelech,</HI> and altho' this be not &s;aving, yet it is the Way to obtain Mercy, and is of great U&s;e in civil Society. It were to be wi&s;h'd that more meant as they &s;poke than do: But &s;piritual Sincerity follows after Conver&s;ion, &amp; aims chiefly at the Glory of God, above all. And it is either Imperfect, or Perfect. The Former is when, for the mo&s;t Part Upright|ne&s;s hath the A&s;cendant, tho' attended with Struggle and
<PB N="227" REF="005500_0230_103965E3137C7AC8">
Combat. The Latter is when we are entirely free from all corrupt Intention, which is the Priviledge of the <HI>Coun|try,</HI> and not of the Way, when that which is Perfect is come, then that which is in Part &s;hall be done away.</P>
<P>But it will not be improper to add to what hath been &s;aid, the following Marks of <HI>Sincerity,</HI> viz. 1&s;t. If we do not cover and hide our Sins, but confe&s;s them and for&s;ake them. 2dly. If we avoid all appearance of Evil, both as to Principle and Practice. 3dly. If in Pro&s;perity, as well as in Adver&s;ity, we cleave inviolably to the Truths and Du|ties of Religion. 4thly. If in the Ab&s;ence as well as Pre&s;ence of Spectators, we endeavour to be Holy. 5thly. If we have the Light of God's Word, and are willing to have our States and Actions tried the reby. 6thly. If we are &s;en|&s;ible of, and bewail the Remains of Hypocri&s;y that are in us, as the poor Man that cried <HI>Lord, I believe, help my Unbelief.</HI> But I proceed to the Application of this Di&s;|cour&s;e. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. What has been &s;aid concerning God's Sufficiency, &s;erves to inform us, how great the Portion of every Belie|ver is. It exceeds in Worth and Dignity, Millions of Worlds. The Lord him&s;elf is the <HI>Portion of their Inheritance and of their Cup! Their Lines have fallen to them in plea&s;ant Pla|ces, they have a goodly Heritage!</HI> In having God they have more than all be&s;ides him, yea infinitely more. <Q>If the greate&s;t Princes &s;hould bring all their Trea&s;ures, <HI>(&s;ays Bi&s;hop Hopkins)</HI> the poore&s;t Chri&s;tian can produce a Por|tion, that will beggar them all.</Q> Ju&s;tly then may the Church glory in him, <HI>Lam.</HI> iii. 24. <HI>The Lord is my Por|tion &s;ayeth my Soul, therefore will I hope in him! This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend! O Daughters of Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. The <HI>All-Sufficiency</HI> of God, may convince us of the In-&s;ufficiency and Vanity of all Creatures, <HI>Ecle&s;.</HI> i. 1.
<PB N="228" REF="005500_0231_103965E14A0F3DB8">
<HI>Vanity of Vanities &s;aith the Preacher, Vanity of Vanities all is Vanity!</HI> If God only be ab&s;olutely Perfect and All-Sufficient, then every Creature is of it &s;elf imperfect, and vain, becau&s;e of it&s;elf it has no Perfection, by which it can &s;uffice it&s;elf or others, <HI>Jer.</HI> ii. 13. <HI>They are all broken Ci&s;|terns that can hold no Water!</HI> And if the Creature had any Sufficiency, it could be of no Service, unle&s;s apply'd and ex|cited by the fir&s;t mover: If the Ca&s;e be &s;o, why &s;hould we doat upon them, or confide in them? Or why &s;hould we fear them, or immoderately bewail the lo&s;s of them! And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. We may hence learn the Folly of &s;uch, who for|&s;ake God for the Creature. <HI>Jer.</HI> ii. 13. <HI>My People have committed two Evils, they have for&s;aken the Fountain of li|ving Waters, and hewn out to them&s;elves Ci&s;terns, broken Ci&s;terns, that can hold no Water!</HI> Surely &s;uch as pur&s;ue ly|ing Vanities, for&s;ake their own Mercies! And this they mu&s;t expect, as their Reward, to be di&s;appointed in their Expectations, to be &s;nar'd in the Work of their own Hands and at la&s;t to lye down in Sorrow! But</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The All-Sufficiency of God mini&s;ters &s;trong Con|&s;olation, to all that are &s;incere, and walk with God. Now whether we be indeed &s;uch, we may know by comparing our &s;elves diligently and impartially with what has been before ob&s;erv'd, on the&s;e Heads. What tho' we cannot &s;uf|fice our&s;elves, and what tho' all the World can't &s;uffice us, this is no great Wonder: For the Soul of Man is endowed with an in&s;atiable De&s;ire: Well, but there is an All-Suffici|ent God, who can &s;uffice both him&s;elf and us! And this is, or &s;hould be, all our Salvation, and all our De&s;ire. The Con&s;ideration of God's All-Sufficiency may be a &s;weet Sup|port to us in all Manner of Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, whether of <HI>Mind, Body</HI> or <HI>E&s;tate.</HI> Whether of Spiritual or Temporal Ene|mies, God is our Sun, our Shield and Buckler, who &s;uffices

him&s;elf, and therefore can much more &s;atisfy us, who need not &s;o great Perfection. This Almighty God hath made many and gracious Promi&s;es, that he will be every where and evermore pre&s;ent with his People, and e&s;pecially in the Mount of Difficulty! Of whom then, or of what &s;hould we be afraid? What is the Want that <HI>All-Sufficiency</HI> cannot &s;upply, what is the Strait, that <HI>All-Sufficiency</HI> cannot &s;ur|mount? <HI>David</HI> took encouragement from this Attribute, when he was in &s;ore Di&s;tre&s;s at <HI>Ziglag,</HI> when the Town was &s;ack'd, his Wives taken Captive, and him&s;elf like to be &s;toned to Death (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxx. 6.) And it was this that en|couraged <HI>Abram</HI> again&s;t all human Probability, to expect the Fulfilment of the divine Promi&s;e, concerning a nu|merous Po&s;terity. (<HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 19.) And</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The afore&s;aid Subject, &s;erves to reprove all tho&s;e, who practically deny the <HI>All-Sufficiency</HI> of God; which is done 1&s;t. By the Prophane, who having abandoned the Almigh|ty, &s;erve divers Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures (<HI>Mal.</HI> 3.14.) 2dly. Secret Hypocrites, who tho' they abound in outward Acts of Obedience, yet will not <HI>give to God their whole Hearts,</HI> and that for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e there be &s;ome Things which they look upon as nece&s;&s;ary and profitable which they don't expect from God, and them they are re&s;olv'd to have from Creatures either Right or Wrong. (<HI>Ho&s;.</HI> ii. 4, 5.) And 3dly. Even the Regenerate them&s;elves are liable to this Evil, of denying practically, the <HI>All-Sufficiency</HI> of God. Now this is done in the following In&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. When we u&s;e unlawful or deceitful Mea&s;ures to attain what we think we can't get from God by lawful ones. An Example of this Kind we have in <HI>Jacob,</HI> re&s;pect|ing the Birth-Right. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. When we u&s;e unlawful Methods to e&s;cape immi|nent Dangers. Thus <HI>David</HI> feign'd him&s;elf mad before King
<PB N="230" REF="005500_0233_103965DDED400BA0">
<HI>Achi&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Abram</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac</HI> denied their Wives for fear they &s;hould be &s;lain on their Account. And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. When we inordinately love Creatures, and imagine &s;omething to be in them which is not in God, on this Ac|count Covetou&s;ne&s;s is call'd Idolatry. (<HI>Eph.</HI> v. 5.)</P>
<P N="4">4thly. When we vainly confide in Creatures, and pro|mi&s;e our&s;elves &s;omething from them, which we &s;uppo&s;e the Almighty either cannot or will not confer. (<HI>P&s;.</HI> lxii. 9, 10.)</P>
<P N="5">5thly. When we murmur at our pre&s;ent Condition, and de&s;ire it to be otherwi&s;e than God has alotted it! This Di&s;content was the Occa&s;ion both of the fall of the An|gels and our fir&s;t Parents.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. When we di&s;tru&s;t God's Power, Promi&s;es, or Pro|vidence, with <HI>Mo&s;es, Num.</HI> xi. 13, 14. <HI>Whence &s;hould I have Fle&s;h to give unto all this People?</HI> With <HI>David</HI> 1 Sam. xxvii. 1. Who &s;aid in his Heart, <HI>that he &s;hould one Day pe|ri&s;h by the Hand of</HI> Saul. With <HI>Sarah,</HI> Gen. xviii. 12. Who when &s;he was told that &s;he &s;hould have a Child in old Age, laughed through di&s;tru&s;t, which was di&s;plea&s;ing to God, be|cau&s;e it reflected upon his All-Sufficiency v. 13, 14. <HI>And the Lord &s;aid unto</HI> Abram, <HI>wherefore did</HI> Sarah <HI>laugh, is any Thing too hard for the Lord?</HI> With <HI>Gideon,</HI> who tho' he had the expre&s;s Command of God to war with the <HI>Midia|nites,</HI> and a promi&s;e of Victory over them, yet he&s;itating &s;ays, <HI>Judg.</HI> vi. 15. <HI>O Lord wherewith &s;hall I &s;ave them, for my Family is poor in</HI> Mana&s;&s;eh; and therefore he asked a Sign And</P>

And with <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> who being call'd to publick Service, for God, excus'd him&s;elf thus, <HI>behold I cannot

&s;peak for I am a Child.</HI> Now the afore&s;aid practical Deni|al of Gods All-Sufficiency involves in it Idolatry, and &s;ome degree of Apo&s;tacy; for thereby we turn from him to them, and expect from them, what we &s;uppo&s;e is not in him; as this Evil ob&s;tructs the Cour&s;e of God's Favour to us, &s;o it expo&s;es us to the dreadful Judgments of God. Hence it is &s;aid, that JESUS could do no mighty Works among a certain People, becau&s;e of their Unbelief. And hence we read (2 <HI>Kings</HI> vii. 17.) of a Lord who would not believe <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s Prophe&s;ies of Plenty in <HI>Samaria,</HI> and was troden to Death in the Pre&s;s! And was not <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> upon this Ac|count depriv'd of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Canaan? (Num.</HI> xx. 12.)</P>
<P>Now from the Con&s;ideration of God's <HI>All-Sufficiency,</HI> we &s;hould be exhorted to the following Duties, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. To <HI>glorify God</HI> on this Account, with all our Souls, &s;eeing that this is the Foundation of all his Glory and Ma|je&s;ty. If we &s;hould glorify God, becau&s;e of every of his Attri|butes, how much more on the Account, of this which com|pri&s;es them all. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. To enter into Covenant with him, by accepting of CHRIST, the Angel of the Covenant by a living Faith, <HI>Who is the Way to his Father,</HI> in whom we have Boldne&s;s of acce&s;s with Confidence by the Faith of him. In him all the Promi&s;es are <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Amen.</HI> And thus the <HI>All-Sufficiency</HI> of God will be ours, and without this it will profit us nothing; but on the contrary be engag'd again&s;t us. This Duty of Covenanting with God, our Text and Context points to. <HI>I am the Almighty God, walk before me and be thou perfect: and I will make my Covenant between me and thee.</HI> And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. We &s;hould be exhorted to Contentedne&s;s with our Lot, and to Beneficence towards others, in Imitation of the <HI>All-Sufficiency</HI> of God, in which our chief Excellency con|&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="232" REF="005500_0235_103965DA5F9FC788">4thly.

<P N="6">6thly. We &s;hould hope in this <HI>All-Sufficient</HI> God in all Adver&s;ity, whether per&s;onal or publick, what tho' Clouds and Darkne&s;s hang over the Horizon of the vi&s;ible Church, and the Hand of Pride &s;catters her A&s;&s;emblies, and &s;tains her Glory, yet we mu&s;t not faint or fear, &s;eeing &s;he has an <HI>All-Sufficient</HI> Protector.

And</P>
<P N="7">7thly, While we compare our Emptine&s;s with the Al|mighty's Fullne&s;s we &s;hould be humbled in the Du&s;t, and &s;ay with <HI>Eliphaz, Job</HI> iv. 17, 19. <HI>Shall Mortal Man be more ju&s;t than God, &s;hall a Man be more pure than his Maker, behold he put no Tru&s;t in his Servants, and his Angels he charg|ed with Folly, how much le&s;s on them who dwell in Hou&s;es of Clay, who&s;e Foundation is in the Du&s;t, who are cru&s;hed before the Moth!</HI> It is a noble &s;aying of <HI>Gregory</HI> <Q>That our Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s brought to the Tryal of Ju&s;tice, is Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. and that <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> which &s;hine in the Opinion of the Worker, is loath&s;ome in the Sight of the Judge.</Q> And &s;hould we not obey diligently and wor&s;hip reverently that <HI>All-Sufficient</HI>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JEREMIAH xxxii. 17.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Ah Lord God, behold, thou ha&s;t made the Heavens and the Earth by thy great Power, and &s;tretched out Arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE have in the&s;e Words, the beginning of the Pro|phet <HI>Jeremiah</HI>'s Prayer, the Occa&s;ion of which was the Di&s;coveries which <HI>Jehovah</HI> had made to him of his Purpo&s;e, to pull down the Nation, by putting it under the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> King. The pious Prophet was impri&s;oned for declaring this Truth, a|greeable to the divine Direction, the City was in the mean Time be&s;ieged by <HI>Nebucadnezar</HI>'s Army: A di&s;mal Cloud cover'd the whole Face of Affairs! The poor Prophet be|ing a faithful Interce&s;&s;or for that People, was exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to behold the impending Stroak, the approach|ing Ruin of his beloved Nation, he therefore knowing God to be infinite in Power and Mercy, takes his Flight to him in the afore&s;aid gloomy and perplex'd State of Things, and puts up an interce&s;&s;ory Supplication for them; which begins with a Recognition of God's infinite Power, made manife&s;t in his Formation of the Heaven and Earth: The&s;e va&s;t Bodies being produced by a Word, and in a Moment, are inconte&s;tible Demon&s;trations of an Almighty Cau&s;e or Efficient. God him&s;elf us'd this In&s;tance, <HI>Chap.</HI> xxvii. 5.
<PB N="236" REF="005500_0239_103965D37B8628C0">
to confirm his Peoples Faith in his Ability, to do what he plea&s;ed. It is probable that the Prophet makes Mention of God's Omnipotence in the In&s;tances before related, and farther expounds upon it by &s;aying, <HI>That nothing was too hard for him,</HI> (in the beginning of his Prayer) with a Three|fold De&s;ign, 1&s;t. To affect his own Heart with an awful Sen&s;e of the divine Maje&s;ty. And 2dly. To &s;upport his Faith in expecting the Mercies he prayed for. And 3dly. As an Argument to excite, as it were, Omnipotence to exert it &s;elf in the Deliverance of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from the threatn'd De|&s;truction. <HI>God is a pre&s;ent Help in Trouble,</HI> yea and a pow|erful one, nothing is two hard for him, that does not im|ply &s;ome Weakne&s;s or Contradiction. It is therefore our wi&s;e&s;t Cour&s;e, in Imitation of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI>'s Ex|ample, to make &s;peedy and affectionate Supplication to him in all di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Imergents, either re&s;pecting our &s;elves or the Church of God! The Particle <HI>Ah!</HI> in the beginning of our Text, denotes the Depth and Vehemence of the Prophets mournful Pa&s;&s;ion! And indeed our very Bow|els &s;hould bleed for poor <HI>Zions</HI> Tragedies, and our Lips move in the Prophets Strains; for <HI>Jeru&s;alems &s;ake I will not hold my Peace, and for</HI> Zion's <HI>&s;ake I will not be Silent, until the Righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof go forth as Brightne&s;s, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth.</HI> But to re|turn: The Text I have read, con&s;idered ab&s;tractly, pre&s;ents to our Meditations the <HI>Power</HI> of God. in di&s;cour&s;ing upon which I &s;hall con&s;ider its <HI>Nature, Kinds, Properties</HI> and <HI>Effects,</HI> and then apply it. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. God's Power may be thus de&s;crib'd, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That it is his e&s;&s;ential Property whereby he can do all Things.</Q> Thus excellent Mr. Vincent explains it. Or in other Words thus, <HI>That it is that divine Vertue, whereby Jehovah does what he Wills, and has ability to do what he Wills not.</HI> And hence
<PB N="237" REF="005500_0240_103965D1AB31F008">
it appears, that the Power of God is twofold, <HI>viz. Ab&s;olute and Ordinate.</HI> The <HI>ab&s;olute Power</HI> of God, is that whereby he can do all Things that are po&s;&s;ible, even &s;uch Things as never came to pa&s;s, of this mention is made, Matt. iii. 9. <HI>God is able of the&s;e Stones to rai&s;e up Children unto</HI> Abram: This, according to our Conception, preceeds the Will of God, and coinceeds with the All-&s;ufficiency of his E&s;&s;ence. Ephe&s;. iii. 20. Rom. xi. 23. <HI>And they al&s;o if they bide not &s;till in unbelief, &s;hall be graffed in, for God is able to graff them in again.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. The <HI>ordinate Power of God,</HI> is that whereby <HI>Je|hovah</HI> effects what he Plea&s;es; and therefore follows his Will, P&s;a. cxxxv. 6. <HI>What&s;oever the Lord plea&s;ed that did he in Heaven and Earth, in the Seas and all deep Places.</HI> God's <HI>ordinate Power</HI> relates to his Efficiency, or to the Effects which he has, does or &s;hall produce. It is not realy different from the former, but the former con&s;i|der'd as limitted by the divine Decree, which certainly fixes the <HI>Boundaries</HI> between what is meerly <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> and what is <HI>Future.</HI> Hence it is &s;aid that our Lord could not do many Miracles, in his native Country, becau&s;e of their Unbelief, and that the Almighty could not de&s;troy <HI>Sodom</HI> till <HI>Lot</HI> was out of it. The Power of God was bounded or limitted by his Purpo&s;e, which he could not counteract. Neither is it any Imperfection in the Almighty, that he can|not contradict his own Nature; but on the Contrary, it is the highe&s;t Perfection!</P>
<P>Nor are we to &s;uppo&s;e, that Power belongs to God as di&s;tingui&s;hed from Act; for then he would be at one Time idle, and at another employ'd in Labour, and &s;o &s;uffer a Change. No! the Almighty is a mo&s;t pure Act. The afore&s;aid Di&s;tinction is only a&s;crib'd to God on the Account of Creatures, becau&s;e they undergo an Operation of God in
<PB N="238" REF="005500_0241_103965D028A1D718">
Time, which before they did not undergo, <HI>e. g.</HI> when Men are warm'd by the Sun now, who were before cold, the Change is not in the Sun, but in them.</P>
<P>It &s;hould likewi&s;e be con&s;idered, that the afore&s;aid Di&s;|tinction of God's Power into <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> and <HI>ordinate,</HI> is only in re&s;pect of our Conception; for in God him&s;elf it is mo&s;t Simple, and therefore but one, becau&s;e it is his E&s;&s;ence.</P>
<P>But I proceed to con&s;ider the <HI>Properties of God's Power,</HI> which was the third general Head. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Power of God is <HI>Infinite,</HI> and that in three re&s;pects, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Agent, Objects, Effects.</HI> The <HI>Agent God</HI> is <HI>Infinite</HI> in his Being, and with this his Power co|inceeds, or is the &s;ame. The <HI>Objects</HI> are likewi&s;e <HI>innumera|ble,</HI> which can be produc'd by him, and therefore Infinite, in &s;ome Sen&s;e. And as <HI>Wendeline</HI> well ob&s;erves, <Q>God never produces an Effect &s;o Excellent, but he can produce a more Excellent.</Q> The &s;acred Scriptures confirm the Infinity of God's Power, various Ways, 1&s;t. <HI>Symbolically</HI> and <HI>Figuratively,</HI> when it a&s;cribes to him a <HI>&s;trong Hand, a &s;tretched out Arm,</HI> 1 Chro. xxix. 12. <HI>In thine Hand is Power and Might.</HI> Our Text a&s;cribes to God, a &s;tretched out Arm, and intimates, <HI>that thereby the Heaven and Earth were made.</HI> 2dly. <HI>Negatively,</HI> when it denies any Thing to be Difficult to him. Gen. xviii. 14. <HI>Is any Thing too hard for the Lord. At the Time appointed will I return unto thee, according to the Time of Life, and</HI> Sarah <HI>&s;hall have a Son.</HI> Agreeable hereto are the Words of our Text, <HI>and there is Nothing too hard for thee.</HI> 3dly. <HI>Effectively,</HI> when it a|&s;cribes the greate&s;t Effects to God's Power, &s;uch as the Pro|ductions of the Heavens and Earth, as the Text we are con|&s;idering doth, <HI>Ah Lord God! behold thou ha&s;t made the Hea|vens and the Earth by thy great Power!</HI> And likewi&s;e when

(Rev.</HI> i. 8.) It is ob&s;erv'd by &s;ome, that God's Almightine&s;s, or infinite Power, is a&s;&s;erted no le&s;s than Seventy Times in Scripture.

<P>And does not Rea&s;on likewi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame Truth? For &s;eeing Power is a Perfection, how can it be deny'd to him who is infinitely Perfect.

Neither was there any before him, to limit this, or any other of his At|tributes, and therefore it is Infinite. If God were not Infi|nite in Power, his Determinations would be precarious and trifling, like tho&s;e of his Creatures: And his Promi&s;es and Threatnings in rewarding or puni&s;hing, would neither de|&s;erve our Tru&s;t or Fear: For then he could not &s;ay as he does, I&s;a. xlvi. 11. <HI>I have &s;poken it, I will al&s;o bring it to pa&s;s, I have purpo&s;ed it, I will al&s;o do it.</HI> And</P>

He cannot make a Creature equal to him&s;elf, for then it would not be a Creature: God indeed can do what is impo&s;&s;ible <HI>to Nature.</HI> i. e. he can exceed its &s;tated Bounds and Limits, as appears by the miraculous Works he has wrought: But he cannot do <HI>what is impo&s;&s;ible in Nature.</HI> Now that is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible in Nature</HI> which involves a Contradiction, either on the Part of God, when the Work implies an Imperfection, in a mo&s;t per|fect Worker, or on the Part of Things, when they over|throw them&s;elves.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI>MOSES</HI> is enjoyned by <HI>Jehovah</HI> in the fir&s;t Ver&s;e of this Chapter, and al&s;o in that out of which our Text is taken, to deliver the &s;ummary of divine Laws to all the Congregation of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael. Mo&s;es</HI> mu&s;t make known God's Statutes, and pro|claim them thro' the Camp, that &s;o every one might hear and know his Duty, in order to practice the &s;ame. And hence we may learn, that the Devotion which &s;prings from Ignorance, that that Religion which commends it, cannot be of God; becau&s;e it is directly contrary to the Method which God has taken with his rea&s;onable Creatures, re&s;|pecting the Affairs of Religion, in all the Ages of the Church, both under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ations! Now the Words of our Text contain two Things ob&s;ervable, <HI>viz.</HI> A <HI>Command,</HI> and a <HI>Rea&s;on enforcing</HI> it. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. There is a <HI>Command, ye &s;hall be Holy,</HI> <Q><HI>The Word</HI> Holy, &s;ays Pool in his Synop&s;is upon the Place, and other learned Men, <HI>properly &s;ignifies to &s;eparate,</HI> i. e. <HI>from a Common to a Religious U&s;e</HI></Q> And hence the Temple and Tabernacle and many Things in both, were call'd <HI>Holy:</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="005500_0255_103965B8DD0ED7C0">
And likewi&s;e the whole People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and many other Things, which it is needle&s;s to mention: The Word here &s;ignifies, <Q>not only a Sepation from all the Defilements before mentioned;</Q> as Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> ob&s;erves, both in his <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> and <HI>Annotations;</HI> but al&s;o an inward Aver&s;ion to all I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urity and Sin, together with a habitual Devoted|ne&s;s to all moral Purity. <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s being di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other People, by peculiar Laws, was to teach them the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a real Separation from the World and the Fle&s;h, and of an entire Devotedne&s;s to God; and this is likewi&s;e the Law of Chri&s;t, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 15.16. <HI>But as he who hath cal|led you is Holy, &s;o be ye Holy in all manner of Conver&s;ation; becau&s;e it is written, be ye Holy, for I am Holy.</HI> We are the Followers of the Holy JESUS, and therefore mu&s;t, ac|cording to our Capacity, be con&s;ecrated to God's Honour, and conform'd to his Nature and Will, <HI>ye &s;hall be Holy;</HI> the Words are not a Prophe&s;y or Promi&s;e, but a Precept, importing as much as this, <HI>be ye Holy.</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 15. Or <HI>ye mu&s;t be Holy.</HI> It is as if God had &s;aid, ye mu&s;t take Care and Pains, to have the Habits or Principles of Holine&s;s, im|planted in your Hearts, and to exerci&s;e and expre&s;s the &s;ame, in all your Speech and Practice!

<P>The Subject that offers it &s;elf to our pre&s;ent Meditations, from the Text, which I have been labouring to explain, is that <HI>venerable Attribute</HI> of the <HI>divine Nature,</HI> viz. <HI>Holine&s;s:</HI> This is very frequently a&s;cribed to God in the &s;acred Scriptures, thus he is call'd <HI>the Holy one,</HI> I&s;a. xl. 25. Likewi&s;e <HI>the Holy one of</HI> I&s;rael, above 30 Times, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xli. 20.

Or the Character of <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> is three Times repeated. Holine&s;s is a&s;crib'd to all the Per&s;ons of the Trinity, the Father is call'd <HI>the Holy one of I&s;rael:</HI> The Son is call'd <HI>the mo&s;t Holy,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an. ix 24.

</LIST></P>
<P>And la&s;tly proceed to &s;ome practical U&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Then &s;eeing the Holine&s;s of God, as it is in him, is &s;o Sublime and Tran&s;cendent, that it is inacce&s;&s;ible to our weak and finite Minds; it will be nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t to behold it in its Emblem, or Effects, and from that to proceed to the producing Cau&s;e, or Prototype. Now the Image or Effect of the Holine&s;s of God, is that Holine&s;s, which Jehovah is pleas'd to form in intelligent Beings or Creatures. Holine&s;s therefore in its general Nature, may be thus de&s;crib'd, <HI>viz. That it is the moral Goodne&s;s of a rea|&s;onable Being.</HI> To under&s;tand which, let it be ob&s;erv'd, that <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> is <HI>two-fold, viz. Phy&s;ical</HI> and <HI>Moral, Phy&s;ical Goodne&s;s</HI> is likewi&s;e two-fold, <HI>viz.</HI> either of <HI>Being</HI> or <HI>U&s;e;</HI> a Thing may be call'd Good <HI>phy&s;ically</HI> or <HI>naturally</HI> either when its being is de&s;ireable, or when it &s;erves to an&s;wer the End de&s;ign'd for it. In both the&s;e Re&s;ects, all the ina|nimate and irrational Parts of the Creation are call'd Good by God him&s;elf, the be&s;t Judge of Things. <HI>Gen.</HI> i. ult. <HI>And God &s;aw every Thing that he had made and behold it was very Good!</HI> But <HI>moral Goodne&s;s,</HI> is that which is adorn'd, with &s;uch Manners, as become a God! and this is peculiar to rea&s;onable Creatures. Now the Holine&s;s of Creatures is
<PB N="255" REF="005500_0258_103965B35E7568B8">
three-fold, <HI>viz. Relative, Fedral,</HI> and <HI>Real,</HI> 1&s;t. <HI>Relative,</HI> is that whereby Times and Places, and other Things are call'd holy, becau&s;e they relate to a Holy God, and are appro|priated by him, being &s;eparated from a Common, and de|dicated to a Religious U&s;e by his Authority, which they have a Tendency to promote. In this Sen&s;e the Sabbath, the Temple, and many Things in it, were call'd Holy. 2dly <HI>Federal Holine&s;s,</HI> is that whereby Per&s;ons are &s;eparated from the World, to be God's peculiar People, in order to the Study of Holine&s;s, when they profe&s;s this, and by their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion are in the Judgment of a rea&s;onable Charity, look'd upon as Saints or Holy Per&s;ons. <HI>Deut.</HI> vii. 6. <HI>For thou art a Holy People unto the Lord thy God, the Lord thy God hath cho&s;en thee to be a &s;pecial People unto him&s;elf, above all People that are on the Face of the Earth.</HI> Num. xv. 40. <HI>That ye may remember, and do all my Commandments and be Holy un|to your God.</HI> In this re&s;pect the Whole Nation of I&s;rael, were of old Holy to God (<HI>Ex.</HI> xix. 6.) They are therefore call'd <HI>a Holy Nation.</HI> (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 9. <HI>Num.</HI> xvi. 3.) And Scores of Times the whole Nation of I&s;rael are call'd <HI>God's People</HI> in Scripture. <HI>Ex.</HI> iii. 10. <HI>That thou may&s;t bring forth my People the Children of I&s;rael out of</HI> Egypt. In this Re&s;pect the Children of believing Parents are Holy. (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vii. 14.) But 3dly. <HI>Real Holine&s;s,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the Exerci&s;e and Growth of good Habits or pious Di&s;po&s;itions infus'd, and is therefore twofold, <HI>viz. Habitual</HI> and <HI>actual. Habitual,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ts in the inward <HI>Purity</HI> of the Will and Affections, whereby we are inclin'd to live to God; or it con&s;i&s;ts, in the Infu&s;ion of a Con&s;tellation, or Train of Graces, into the Soul, which turns its inward and general Bent into a &s;piritual and Heavenly Channel! By this the Soul of Man, is in &s;ome Sort conform'd to the Nature of God; <HI>Actual</HI> Holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the Exerci&s;e of the afore&s;aid divine Ha|bits,
<PB N="256" REF="005500_0259_103965B1A269A1A0">
e&s;pecially in our Speech and Practice, whereby, thro' God's gracious Concurrence, they are increas'd. Hereby the Life is conform'd to God's Will and Law: From what has been ob&s;erv'd, it appears, therefore that Holine&s;s contains the four following Ingredients, or Particulars. <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. A <HI>Separation</HI> from a <HI>common</HI> or <HI>profane U&s;e,</HI> in which Sen&s;e, <HI>Paul</HI> the Apo&s;tle, is &s;aid to be <HI>&s;eparated to the Go&s;pel of God.</HI> Rom. i. 1. And the Lord JESUS as Mediator, is &s;aid <HI>to be &s;anctified. John</HI> x. 36. And 2dly. A <HI>Dedication</HI> to a <HI>divine</HI> or <HI>religious U&s;e,</HI> whereby we deliberately, unre&s;er|vedly, and re&s;olutely <HI>devote</HI> our&s;elves and our all to the Di|vine Glory and Service. (<HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 1. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> viii. 5.) Fir&s;t they gave their own &s;elves to the Lord.&mdash;And 3dly. It con|tains a <HI>Repre&s;entation,</HI> of the <HI>Divine Holine&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Heart</HI> re|&s;embling the <HI>Purity</HI> of the divine <HI>Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Life</HI> the <HI>Purity</HI> of the <HI>Divine Law.</HI> And 4thly. Holine&s;s includes a <HI>Dete&s;tation</HI> of, and <HI>Flight</HI> from all <HI>Impurity. P&s;.</HI> xcvii. 10. <HI>Ye that love the Lord hate Evil.</HI></P>
<P>From the afore&s;aid Image, or <HI>Emblem</HI> of Holine&s;s in Creatures, we may gather this De&s;cription, of the Holine&s;s of God! <HI>viz.</HI> That it is his <HI>Moral Excellency,</HI> whereby <HI>he is &s;eparated from every thing common or prophane, hereby he is inclind to &s;eek him&s;elf, and his Glory above all. (Pro.</HI> xvi. 4. <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> i. 11.) <HI>and is conform'd exactly to that Holine&s;s which is expre&s;s'd in the Moral Law in his Thoughts, Words and Deeds.</HI> And hence he often in his Word invites Men to an Imitation of his Holine&s;s. (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 15, 16.) As God's <HI>Power</HI> is <HI>oppos'd</HI> to all <HI>natural</HI> Weakne&s;s, and his <HI>Wi&s;dom to Folly,</HI> &s;o <HI>his Holine&s;s is oppos'd to all moral Blemi&s;hes,</HI> or Im|perfections, which we call Sin. <HI>Hab.</HI> i. 13.</P>
<P><HI>Holine&s;s</HI> is a <HI>Di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> to &s;eek the mo&s;t excellent End, in the highe&s;t Degree, and to refer all to it. The be&s;t Good, certainly de&s;erves to be the la&s;t End! Now Jehovah
<PB N="257" REF="005500_0260_103965B0056C9878">
being him&s;elf, the be&s;t Good, infinitely &s;uperior in Ex|cellency, to all Creatures, he mu&s;t therefore con&s;equently be his own la&s;t End! Hence is that of the Prophet. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xlii. 8. <HI>I am the Lord, that is my Name, and my Glory will I not give to another, nor my Prai&s;e to Graven Images.</HI> And it ap|pears farther to be rea&s;onable, that God &s;hould &s;eek him&s;elf as his own la&s;t End, becau&s;e he is Self-exi&s;tent, &amp; from no other! This <HI>Devotedne&s;s</HI> therefore of the Almighty to &s;eek his own <HI>Glory, as his chief End,</HI> appears to be a very con&s;iderable <HI>Branch</HI> of the Holine&s;s of God. But for Creatures, who are but an inferior Good, and borrow their Beings from a|nother to make them&s;elves, or any thing that concerns them as &s;uch, their la&s;t End, is a great In&s;tance of Impiety: The very nature of Sin &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in this, <HI>viz.</HI> A <HI>Deviation</HI> or wandering in our <HI>Views, De&s;igns</HI> or <HI>Affecti|ons</HI> from God's Glory, to &s;ome other End, <HI>as Chief</HI> and Su|pream. Seeing that all Things are from God, as a creat|ing or producing Cau&s;e, and thro' him al&s;o as a &s;upporting Cau&s;e, therefore all ought to be directed to him, as a final Cau&s;e. (<HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 36.) The Holine&s;s of God &s;eems to be the Harmony of his Attributes, as they are oppos'd to Sin! and therefore it's call'd the <HI>Beauty</HI> of the Lord! <HI>P&s;.</HI> xxvii. 4. <HI>One Thing have I de&s;ir'd of the Lord, that will I &s;eek after, that I may dwell in the Hou&s;e of the Lord, to behold the Beau|ty of the Lord.</HI>&mdash;Holine&s;s &s;eems to put a Lu&s;tre upon the other Perfections of the divine Nature, without which, they would be inglorious&punc; becau&s;e impure!</P>
<P>Now the Holine&s;s of God, is either <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> or <HI>declarative.</HI> The <HI>e&s;&s;ential Holine&s;s of God</HI> is <HI>nothing el&s;e but the tran&s;cend|ant and incomprehen&s;ible Eminence of the divine Nature or Being, or his Purity and Glory.</HI> And hence he is &s;aid <HI>to be glorious in Holine&s;s. (Ex.</HI> xv. 11.) The <HI>declarative Holi|ne&s;s of God</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>Di&s;plays</HI> of the <HI>Former</HI> in God's

<P N="1">1&s;t. It is <HI>original Holine&s;s,</HI> it is the Source of all tho&s;e Stremes of Holine&s;s which appear in Creatures: It is the Sub&s;tance and Prototype, their's but the Shadow and Co|py borrow'd from it! <HI>Jehovah</HI> has receiv'd it from none, but created Beings derive all theirs from this, Rom. xi. 35 &mdash;<HI>Who hath fir&s;t given to him?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is <HI>&s;imple Holine&s;s,</HI> i. e. It is the very Being of God, and not any Thing added to it: Hence God is &s;aid to <HI>&s;wear by his Holine&s;s,</HI> P&s;al. lxxxix 35. Whereas Holine&s;s in Creatures is not their Nature, or Being, but &s;ome Di&s;po&s;ition or Quality added to it, and therefore &s;eparable from it; and hence they are only call'd Holy, but not Holine&s;s: This la&s;t Term &s;peaks an Ab&s;tract, &s;imple and uncompounded Being! And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It is <HI>eternal Holine&s;s,</HI> and this it mu&s;t needs be, &s;eeing it is the &s;ame with his E&s;&s;ence; which has been be|fore prov'd to be eternal, in a proceeding Sermon. As it is impo&s;&s;ible in the Nature of Things, that ever God &s;hould be|gin to be, &s;o it is equally impo&s;&s;ible that ever he &s;hould be without Holine&s;s, which is his Beauty and Glory, for then he would be no God; but a Being of a contrary Character. Now as the Holine&s;s of God had no Beginning, &s;o by Con&s;equence it can have no End! Whereas on the Contrary the Beings of all Creatures, beginning with Time, or commencing in it, are Temporary; and their Holine&s;s, which could not exi&s;t before their Beings, mu&s;t be of the like Kind: As it had a Beginning &s;o it may have an End.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="259" REF="005500_0262_103965ACE0871E30">4thly. <HI>Immutable Holine&s;s:</HI> It is liable to no Change or Alteration, for the Rea&s;on afore&s;aid, <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e it is him|&s;elf: And hence it is &s;aid, <HI>Rev.</HI> xv. 4.

Rectitude crown'd the human Nature in its primitive State, together with a freedom of Will and Power to per|&s;evere therein!

<P N="3">3dly.

<P N="3">3dly.

The <HI>Angels,</HI> tho&s;e Attendants of Wor&s;hip, are call'd <HI>holy. Luke</HI> ix. 26. And is not Holine&s;s the great De&s;ign, and Tenden|cy of Religious Wor&s;hip?

<P N="1">1&s;t. If God be Holy, as has been prov'd, then we may hence learn, that he cannot be the Author of Sin, which is &s;o contrary to his Nature, or of any Doctrines that tend to promote it. Now the following Doctrines of the <HI>Papi&s;ts,
<PB N="264" REF="005500_0267_103965A41F91F090">
Antinomians,</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> are of this Sort, and therefore &s;hould be rejected with Abhorrence, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Doctrine of Indulgencies, or Pardons for Sin. This was oppos'd by <HI>Swinglius</HI> in <HI>Helvetia,</HI> and by <HI>Luther</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> in the Year 1516. and being defended by Pope <HI>Leo,</HI> became the Occa&s;ion of the Reformation.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Popi&s;h Di&s;tinction of Sins into Venial and Mortal. The Former they &s;ay do not de&s;erve eternal Puni&s;hment, contrary to Scripture, (<HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 23.)</P>
<P>To tho&s;e I might add their gainful Doctrine of Purgatory. And likewi&s;e their holding with the Phari&s;ees of old, that the Law re&s;pects only outward Acts: Whereas the inward Principle from which tho&s;e flow, is more corrupt than any Act that proceeds from it. As the afore&s;aid Doctrines are mo&s;t ab&s;urd in them&s;elves: For how can it be &s;uppos'd with any Appearance of Rea&s;on, that any can forgive Sins, but that God again&s;t whom they are committed? I &s;ay as they are ab&s;urd in them&s;elves, &s;o they have a manife&s;t Ten|dency to promote impiety, and therefore are not of God.</P>
<P>To the Former Catalogue, may be added &s;ome <HI>Antinomi|an</HI> Doctrines, which are not le&s;s unrea&s;onable and perilous, <HI>viz.</HI> Ju&s;tification from Eternity, or from the Time of Chri&s;t's Death. That the Law is no Rule of Life to Believers; that there is no need of Repentance under the Go&s;pel; that Faith con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch an A&s;&s;urance, as is &s;ucceeded by no Doubts; That there is no preparative (of order) that goes before Faith. Tho&s;e Doctrines open a Door to all Impiety. They directly tend to make Chri&s;t a Mini&s;ter of Sin, and his Go&s;pel an In&s;trument of Iniquity; and therefore cannot be from God. It is an In&s;tance of the vile&s;t Ingratitude, to draw from the Doctrine of free Forgivene&s;s, an Argument again&s;t Repentance!</P>
<P>And indeed the <HI>Arminian</HI> Doctrine of Univer&s;al Redem|tion,
<PB N="265" REF="005500_0268_103965A29B4F5D10">
has an awful Tendency to make Men &s;ecure in Sin. Of the like Nature is the Doctrine of all <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> in oppo&s;ing the &s;tated Performance of Religious Duty. This, whatever fal&s;e Gui&s;es is put upon it, tends to wear off the Sen&s;e of God and divine Things, and to prepare Men for Delu&s;ions in Principle and Iniquity in Practice. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. From what has been &s;aid, in the Explicatory Part of this Di&s;cour&s;e, we &s;hould be induc'd to examine our&s;elves, in order to know whether we be truly Holy or not? Which we may know by an impartial comparing of our&s;elves, with what has been already deliver'd on this Subject, to which I &s;hall add the following <HI>Characters</HI> of true Holine&s;s, which duly con&s;ider'd may a&s;&s;i&s;t the Examination of our&s;elves. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>True Holine&s;s</HI> is <HI>Sincere,</HI> it Eyes God more than Man, and aims at his Glory above all, in the general Cour&s;e of Action. And herein it is like the Holine&s;s of God him&s;elf, ina&s;much as it aims at the &s;ame End with him. (<HI>Mat.</HI> vi. 1, &mdash;6. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 31.)</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is <HI>internal chiefly,</HI> as it begins in the Mind and Heart, &s;o it takes more Care of that, than the Out&s;ide. (<HI>P&s;.</HI> li. 6.) directly contrary to this were the Phari&s;ees of old in their Practice. (<HI>Mat.</HI> xxiii. 23.)</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It is <HI>Evangelical,</HI> proceeding chiefly from that Faith in CHRIST, which is of the Operation of God, and work|eth by Love. As God's People receive Strength from CHRIST to perform Acts of Holine&s;s, by a believing De|pendance on him, &s;o they are con&s;trained or influenced by Love to him, to labour to be Holy. And their Attainments and Labours in Religion, are attended with a humble Sen&s;e of their own Imperfection. <HI>Not as tho' I had already at|tain'd,</HI> &s;aid holy <HI>Paul, or were already perfect, but I pre&s;s forward.</HI> And</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="266" REF="005500_0269_103965A0CAE66F90">4th. True Holine&s;s is <HI>Univer&s;al,</HI> and that both in regard of the <HI>Subject</HI> in which it is <HI>plac'd,</HI> and the <HI>Object</HI> about which it is <HI>exercis'd.</HI> The whole Soul in all its Powers is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure renew'd, the <HI>Mind</HI> is <HI>enlightned, the Will bow'd, the Affections in their general Bent,</HI> and in the <HI>highe&s;t degree are turn'd towards God.</HI> And both Soul and Body &s;eparated from the habitually governing Love of the World, and willingly devoted to God, together with all we po&s;&s;e&s;s, not re&s;erving to our&s;elves any Thing with <HI>Ananias,</HI> and <HI>Sa|phira,</HI> and the young Phari&s;ee. (<HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 12. 1 <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;.</HI> v. 23.)

<P N="5">5thly <HI>True Holine&s;s</HI> is <HI>continual,</HI> it endures to the End, &s;uch as have it, aim at, and labour for Growth in Goodne&s;s, and when they find not &s;atisfactory Signs thereof, are griev'd!</P>
<P>Now all &s;uch <HI>who</HI> upon Examination find in them&s;elves, the preceeding Characters of Holine&s;s, may take Comfort to their Souls, whatever Circum&s;tances of Di&s;couragement they may be in, from within or from without. And that for the following Rea&s;ons. 1&s;t. Becau&s;e it is not the Mea|&s;ure, but Truth of Grace that evidences our Sanctification. 2dly. Becau&s;e our imperfect Holine&s;s, is accepted thro' Chri&s;t, in whom we are compleat. <HI>He is made of God to us Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification and Redemption.</HI> 3dly. He that has begun a good Work in us, has promi&s;ed to car|ry it on, <HI>to the Day of the Lord JESUS.</HI> God is Holy and

the Fountain of all Holine&s;s. God has promis'd to take a|way the <HI>Stony Heart, and give us a Heart of Fle&s;h, to give us a new Heart and a new Spirit, and that he will cau&s;e us to walk in his Statutes. Ezek.</HI> xxxvi. 25, 27. 4thly. What tho' we at Times are afflicted with our Corruptions, it is no more than the Saints of God have been before us! <HI>Woe is me, &s;aith</HI> I&s;aiah, <HI>for I am a Man of polluted Lips. I&s;a.</HI> vi. 5. Yea this is the Language of the Church. <HI>I&s;.</HI> lxiv. 6. <HI>But we are all as an unclean Thing and all our Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es, are as filthy Rags, and we all do fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities, like the Wind have taken us away.</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t complains of the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e, and yet Hopes. <HI>P&s;.</HI> lxv. 3. <HI>Iniquities prevail again&s;t me, as for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, thou &s;halt purge them away.</HI> And thus did the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul.

But God will blot out our Iniquities, as a thick Cloud, and will remember our Sins no more, I&s;.</HI> xl. 22. <HI>CHRIST hath given him&s;elf for his Church, that he might &s;anctify it, by the wa&s;hing of Water thro' the Word. Eph.</HI> v. 25, 26. And let us comfort our&s;elves with this, in all our Troubles, that he who now &s;anctify's us, will by and by glorify us, (<HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 30.)</P>
<P>But on the contrary all &s;uch as want the afore&s;aid Cha|racters, are in a doleful Ca&s;e! In the Gall of Bitterne&s;s and Bond of Iniquity. Such, &s;o continuing, can have no Commu|nion with a Holy God here, nor enjoy him hereafter. (1 <HI>Joh.</HI> i. 6.&mdash;<HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 14.) And e&s;pecially how di&s;mal is the Ca&s;e, how impious the Cour&s;e, of tho&s;e who murmur at &s;trictne&s;s in Religion, and deride Holine&s;s. What do the&s;e in Effect, but ri&s;e up in Arms again&s;t God him&s;elf, while they practi|cally deny his Holine&s;s. The Language of their Practice is, that they would cau&s;e <HI>the Holy One of I&s;rael</HI> to cea&s;e from among them. They would, if they could, de&s;troy the divine Being; but by their impotent Malice, they will but

&s;ecure and heighten their own Ruin. But I proceed to a U&s;e of Exhortation. From the Con&s;ideration of Gods Holi|ne&s;s, we &s;hould be exhorted, 1&s;t. To <HI>glorify God</HI> on the Ac|count of this divine Attribute after the Example of the Ho|ly Angels. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> vi. 3.&mdash;2dly. Let us &s;eek the <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Sanctification</HI> from God, in the earne&s;t U&s;e of all appoint|ed Means, paticularly by Meditation on its Excellency, and Nece&s;&s;ity, by Prayer, reading and hearing the Word of God, and conver&s;ing with pious People. And 3dly. Let us <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Principles,</HI> in all Holine&s;s of Conver&s;ation. Now we &s;hould be excited to Holine&s;s, by the following Motives. 1&s;t. God is Holy, yea Holine&s;s it&s;elf, and Wills our Sanctification. 2dly. Holine&s;s is his principal and univer|&s;al Perfection, and therefore by the Study of Holine&s;s we re&s;emble God in his chief Excellency. 3dly. He who is Holy, is the Lord, or Jehovah, and &s;o able to compen&s;ate the Labours we u&s;e to be like him. 4thly. He is our God, and &s;o has given him&s;elf to us, and we our&s;elves to him in Covenant, and therefore we are bound to be Holy, both by Gratitude for his unde&s;erved Love, &amp; by our own Promi&s;e. 5thly. Holine&s;s is exceeding excellent, it exalts and eno|bles our rea&s;onable Nature, by conforming it to the Divine. 6thly. It is as nece&s;&s;ary as excellent, in a twofold re&s;pect <HI>viz.</HI> Both of <HI>Command,</HI> and <HI>Mean.</HI> As God enjoyns it by his &s;overeign Authority &s;o it appears to be of ab&s;olute Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, from the very Nature of Things. For without Con|formity to God, we can have no complacence in him, and &s;o no Communion with him, either in this or a future World. And without Communion with God, there can be no Enjoyment of God. See <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 14. 7thly. It is <HI>plea&s;ant.

He &s;ummones the Attention of the inanimate Creation partly to reprove the Stupidity of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and part|ly to bear Witne&s;s to the Truth of what he was about to deliver to them in the following Song, either for their In|&s;truction or Warning, as well as to witne&s;s to the Ju&s;tice and Equity of the divine Proceedings again&s;t that unhappy Nation! <HI>Give Ear O Heavens and I will &s;peak, and hear O Earth the Words of my Mouth!</HI></P>
<P>In the 2d Ver&s;e the devout Penman of this Song, wi&s;hes that the In&s;tructions contain'd in it, may be refre&s;hing to and effectual upon his beloved Nation, as the Rain and Dew upon the Earth, <HI>my Doctrine &s;hall drop as the Rain, my Speech &s;hall di&s;til as the Dew.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e Words may be con&s;idered as a Prayer of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as if he had &s;aid, <HI>O! That it might do &s;o;</HI> thus Bi&s;hop <HI>Patrick</HI> under&s;tands the Words. In the next Ver&s;e he &s;ignifies his Intention to make known the Glory of God, and therefore excites them to <HI>a&s;cribe Greatne&s;s to him;</HI> which Intention he performs in the Words

of our Text, wherein we have a Repre&s;entation of the di|vine Glory and Greatne&s;s apparent in the Perfection of his Works, and equity of his Government, in a Variety of Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. He is call'd a <HI>Rock,</HI> to &s;ignify the <HI>Sta|bility</HI> of his <HI>Nature,</HI> the <HI>Firmne&s;s</HI> of his <HI>Councils,</HI> the <HI>im|mutability</HI> of his <HI>Promi&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Almightine&s;s</HI> of his <HI>Power!</HI> In all which Re&s;pects he is a &s;ecure Shelter and un&s;haken Foundation for our Re&s;ort and Confidence.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. His <HI>Work is Perfect,</HI> <Q>His Work of Creation was &s;o, all that he made in its original Con&s;titution was very Good; his Works of Redemption and Providence &s;hall be be &s;o when the My&s;tery of God is fini&s;hed.</Q> <Q>God's Works are true, and cannot be blam'd, <HI>&s;aith</HI> Ain&s;worth <HI>upon the Place,</HI> God never recalls his Councils, but perfects them.

<P N="3">3dly. <HI>All his Ways are Judgment, i. e.</HI> &s;ayeth Henery, <Q>the Ends of his Ways are all Righteous, and he is Wi&s;e in the Choice of the Means in order to tho&s;e Ends,</Q> By <HI>God's Ways,</HI> we are to under&s;tand all Gods Providential Admi|ni&s;trations towards intelligent Creatures, and by <HI>Judgment, Prudence,</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> (Ho&s;. xiv. 9.)</P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>He is a God of Truth,</HI> i. e. as Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> ob&s;erves in his <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> <Q>Faithful in his Promi&s;es; who&s;e Word we may depend upon, for he cannot Lie.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5thly. <HI>Without Iniquity,</HI> he is perfectly Free from all moral Blemi&s;h and Defect. <Q>He deceives none that con|fides in him, and wrongs none that apply for Ju&s;tice, and is hard upon none that ca&s;t them&s;elves upon his Mercy.</Q></P>

That God is <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> the Scripture proves many Ways, particularly 1&s;t. <HI>Metaphorically</HI> and <HI>Fi|guratively,</HI> when he is therein call'd a <HI>con&s;uming, Fire, an angry Lyon, a Man of War.

(Job.</HI> viii. 3.) Doth God pervert <HI>Judgment,</HI> or doth the Almighty pervert <HI>Ju&s;tice? (Dan.</HI> ix. 14. <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 4.).</P>
<P N="5">5thly. <HI>Po&s;&s;itively,</HI> by affirming and extolling his <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> by calling him a <HI>Revenger, Holy, Right.

<P>And does not Rea&s;on comfirm the &s;ame Truth? For 1&s;t. If God be not Ju&s;t, whence is there any <HI>Ju&s;tice?</HI> Either there would be no <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> at all, or if there was

<P N="2">2dly. Ina&s;much as the Lord is Governor of the whole Univer&s;e, he would degenerate into a Tyrant, if he was not Ju&s;t. And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Seeing <HI>Jehovah</HI> is judge of all the Earth, how could he judge a right without being ju&s;t him&s;elf? Nei|ther can it be otherwi&s;e but that God &s;hould be ju&s;t, &s;ee|ing he is ab&s;olutely Perfect: All confe&s;s Ju&s;tice to be an Excellency, involving no imperfection in it, and therefore it cannot be wanting to that Being, who is ab&s;olutely and infinitely Perfect!</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing upon this divine <HI>Attribute</HI> of God's <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> I purpo&s;e to con&s;ider its <HI>Nature, Kinds, Properties, Di&s;plays,</HI> and in the 5th Place to An&s;wer &s;ome <HI>Objections,</HI> and then proceed to the Improvement. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> in its general Nature may be &s;aid <HI>to be an Agreement with Right and Rule:</HI> It is oppos'd to Crooked|ne&s;s and Obliquity, by which any Thing declines from its proper Rule. Crookedne&s;s in Morals is the &s;ame with Sin; which the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> calls a <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law.</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 4. Or as the original Word, <HI>Anomia,</HI> may be rendered a Being without the Law, or a wandering from the Law. <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> does therefore coincide with Rectitude or Uprightne&s;s, <HI>Ecle.</HI> vii. 29. <HI>Lo this only I have found that God hath made Man Upright:</HI>&mdash;So that Ju&s;tice includes two Things in it e&s;pecially, <HI>viz. Right,</HI> and an <HI>Agreement with that Right,</HI> 1&s;t. I &s;ay it includes <HI>Right</HI> or that which belongs to every one, Luk. xx. 25. <HI>Render therefore unto</HI> Cae&s;ar <HI>the Things that are</HI> Cae&s;ar<HI>'s, and unto God the Things that are God</HI>'s. Rom. i. 32. <HI>Knowing the Judgment of God that they that do &s;uch Things are worthy of Death.</HI>&mdash;It
<PB N="274" REF="005500_0277_10396592EA1DD470">
is from this <HI>Right</HI> that the very Name of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> is deriv'd. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It includes an <HI>Agreement with this Right;</HI> and in this the Form of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> con&s;i&s;ts: And the Contrary to this <HI>viz.</HI> A Di&s;agreement from Right, con&s;titutes the Form of Inju&s;tice. From this general De&s;cription it is evi|dent that Ju&s;tice admits of no Degrees, for a Thing either agrees with the Rule of Right or not; if the Former, it is Ju&s;t, if the Latter, it is Unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly the <HI>Ju&s;tice of God,</HI> as well as of Crea|tures con&s;i&s;ts in an Agreement with Right, but with this difference, that the Creatures have their Rule of Right pre&s;crib'd by another; whereas the divine Nature is a Rule of Right to the Almighty. But let me pa&s;s to the</P>
<P N="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to &s;peak of the <HI>Kinds of Ju&s;tice:</HI></P>
<P>And here it may be ob&s;erv'd that Ju&s;tice may be con&s;i|dered under a threefold View, <HI>viz.</HI> As relating to God's <HI>Will, Word,</HI> and <HI>Deeds.</HI> And 1&s;t. <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> as it relates to the <HI>Will</HI> of God, is thus de&s;crib'd by <HI>Wendeline, viz.</HI> <Q>That it is that whereby God is ju&s;t in him&s;elf and without him&s;elf gives to every one their own by a con&s;tant Will.</Q> <Q>Ju&s;tice in Man, <HI>&s;ayeth Mr.</HI> Leigh, is a &s;ettled Will, to do Right in every Thing to every Per&s;on.</Q> Thus God hath a &s;et|tled Will to do Right, &s;hall not the Judge of all the Earth do Right? This con&s;tant Will of God, to render to every one his own, Coincides with the divine E&s;&s;ence, and may be call'd his <HI>e&s;&s;ential Ju&s;tice,</HI> and is no other but the e&s;&s;en|tial Rectitude of his Nature. And that <HI>Ju&s;tice of God,</HI> which re&s;pects his <HI>Words</HI> and <HI>Deeds,</HI> may be call'd his <HI>declarative</HI> or <HI>relative Ju&s;tice;</HI> becau&s;e it is a Manife&s;tation of the For|mer, and re&s;pects the Tran&s;actions of God with Creatures.</P>
<P>But 2dly. The <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of God, as it relates to his <HI>Words,</HI> is call'd, <HI>Truth, Faithfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tancy;</HI> becau&s;e it a|grees
<PB N="275" REF="005500_0278_10396591643184A8">
with the Rectitude of his Nature to &s;peak &s;o and no otherwi&s;e. Faithfulne&s;s may be well call'd <HI>Ju&s;tice;</HI> be|cau&s;e it is a doing Ju&s;tice to his Word.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The <HI>Ju&s;tice of God,</HI> as it re&s;pects his <HI>Deeds,</HI> is two|fold, <HI>viz.</HI> Of <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Juri&s;diction.</HI> And 1&s;t. God's <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of <HI>Dominion,</HI> or, as &s;ome Divines term it, <HI>his di&s;po|&s;ing Ju&s;tice,</HI> is that whereby <HI>Jehovah,</HI> as the &s;ole Monarch and &s;upream Lord of all, di&s;po&s;es and governs every Thing in a ju&s;t Order; and in Particular he di&s;po&s;es his own Acti|ons, according to the Rule of Equity, requiring and prohi|biting nothing but what is fit for intelligent Creatures, in right Rea&s;on to do and forbear. In a Word this Ju&s;tice of Dominion con&s;i&s;ts in governing rea&s;onable Creatures, agrea|ble to the original Rectitude of their Natures.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. God's <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of <HI>Juri&s;diction,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in pre&s;cribing to rea&s;onable Creatures their proper due, and in governing them accordingly: And this the Almighty doth by three Things, 1&s;t. By pre&s;cribing <HI>Laws,</HI> which are Rules tending to direct Mankind in their Duty to God and Man, agreea|ble to his own Sanctity, attended with Rewards and Puni&s;hments. Jam. iv. 12. <HI>There is one Law-giver who is able to &s;ave and to de&s;troy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. By e&s;tabli&s;hing his Laws by proper <HI>Sanctions</HI> of Rewards and Puni&s;hments promis'd and threatn'd. (<HI>Deut.</HI> xxx. 15.) Now the Sanction con&s;i&s;ts in Promi&s;es and Threat|nings. And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. By <HI>fulfilling the Sanction,</HI> and that both as to the Reward and Puni&s;hment, the former is call'd <HI>Remunerative,</HI> and the latter <HI>Vindictive.</HI> And 1&s;t. <Q>The <HI>Remunerative Ju&s;tice</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> is a mo&s;t ready Will to perform Gods Pro|mi&s;es.</Q> as <HI>Wendline</HI> ob&s;erves. When God rewards the Obedience of his Creatures with a free Reward, proceed|ing from his own pure and abounding Goodne&s;s, not for any

Worth or Condignity in his Peoples Works, as the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> vainly Dream; but for the Sake of his gracious Promi&s;e, by which he makes him&s;elf a Debtor to them, Rom. ii. 6.7, 8. <HI>Who will render to every Man according to his Deeds; to them who by patient Continuance in Well-doing, &s;eek for Glory, and Honour and Immortality, eternal Life: But to them that are Contentious and do not obey the Truth, Indig|nation and Wrath.</HI> Luke xvii. 10. <HI>When we have done all that is commanded, we mu&s;t &s;ay, that we are unprofitable Ser|vants, we have done that which was (but) our Duty to do.</HI> Rom. xi. 35, 36. <HI>Or who hath fir&s;t given to him, and it &s;hall be recompen&s;ed to him again? For of him, and thro' him, and to him are all Things.</HI> Altho there be no intrin&s;ick Worth in Man's Obedience, to merit the Glory or Reward promi&s;ed, yet God having promi&s;ed it to the Creature, and having a Right and Power to confer it, it is ju&s;t and right in him to perform his own Word. And certainly he would wrong his Truth if he did not. When Happine&s;s in Scripture is re|pre&s;ented as a reward, it is only to encourage or excite to Obedience, by &s;hewing the in&s;eparable Connection between Grace wrought in us, and Glory conferr'd upon us: It cannot intend any merit in our Works; for if we our&s;elves be le&s;s then the lea&s;t of God's Mercies, then the be&s;t Acti|ons put forth by us mu&s;t be &s;o: For as Doctor <HI>Ridgly</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>The Action cannot have more Honour a&s;crib'd to it then the Agent.</Q> Being God's Creatures we have deriv'd all from him, and con&s;equently can offer him no more than his own. And Being corrupt Criminals, our Services are Defective, and &s;o cannot merit Good at the Hand of God; nay on the Contrary, for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions we merit his Wrath. And therefore in re&s;pect of us, the Reward of Hap|pine&s;s is wholly Gracious; but indeed in Re&s;pect of Chri&s;t, who has fully an&s;wered the Demands of Law for his Peo|ple,
<PB N="277" REF="005500_0280_1039658DC3BDFE18">
by his Obedience and Suffering, and thereby according to the Covenant Tran&s;action between his Father and him, compleatly purchas'd for them everla&s;ting Life, it may be call'd an <HI>Act of divine Ju&s;tice.</HI> Hence it is &s;aid Rom. ii. 26. That <HI>he might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him that be|lieves in Je&s;us.</HI> But</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The <HI>Vindictive Ju&s;tice of God,</HI> is the Almighty's Will, to execute the Threatnings of his Law upon Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors, by puni&s;hing or inflicting on them Evils of &s;uffer|ing equal to their Crimes: This is call'd <HI>Wrath, Hatred, Revenge</HI> and <HI>Judgment.</HI> It is likewi&s;e term'd <HI>God's vi&s;iting Iniquity,</HI> (Jer. 5.9.) <HI>His &s;etting his Face again&s;t a Per&s;on,</HI> (Lev. xvii. 10.) Its call'd <HI>the Fire of God's Jealou&s;ie,</HI> and tho&s;e that are expos'd to it, are &s;aid <HI>to fall into the Hands of the living God.</HI> Some Divines u&s;e the Terms of reward|ing and Revenging Ju&s;tice, in&s;tead of Remunerative and Vindictive.</P>
<P>But here I would have it ob&s;erv'd, that there is a le&s;s proper Sen&s;e in which the Word <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> is u&s;ed in Scrip|ture. Thus when God corrects his People with his Rod, this is often call'd <HI>Puni&s;hment. (P&s;al.</HI> lxxxix. 30, 33). And hence they are &s;aid <HI>to bear the Indignation of the Lord, be|cau&s;e they have &s;inned again&s;t him.</HI> Mic. vii. 9. The&s;e Af|flictions are call'd <HI>Puni&s;hments,</HI> becau&s;e occa&s;ion'd by Sin, and afflictive to Sen&s;e: But they are not inflicted by God as a Judge, with any Demand of Satisfaction, for that was made by CHRIST, for tho&s;e that believe in him; and &s;ure|ly it is contrary to the Nature of divine Ju&s;tice, to require a double Satisfaction for the &s;ame Crimes! No! the Afflicti|ons of God's People &s;pring from his Fatherly Love to them, and are &s;ent either to prevent or correct &s;inful Di&s;orders. By the&s;e the Almighty humbles his People, by &s;hewing them the De&s;ert of their Impieties; and by the&s;e he brings
<PB N="278" REF="005500_0281_1039658C21227BA0">
them nearer to him&s;elf, and deadens them more to a vain World, and all it's varni&s;h'd but empty Entertainments! Afflictions are the Medicines which the great Phy&s;ician U&s;es to cure his People's manifold Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>But that what has been &s;aid, concerning the Nature of divine Ju&s;tice, may be farther explain'd and illu&s;trated, let the&s;e Things following be con&s;idered. 1&s;t. That Ju&s;tice among Men is Two-fold, <HI>viz.</HI> Either <HI>Commutative</HI> or <HI>Di&s;tri|butive. Commutative,</HI> re&s;pects Trade and Bargains among equals, and con&s;i&s;ts in ob&s;erving the Rules of Equity and Right therein. <HI>Di&s;tributive,</HI> is that which is exercis'd by a Superior towards his Inferiors, and con&s;i&s;ts in the Confor|mity of their Admini&s;trations to rule and law, and therefore comprizes the&s;e four Things in it, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. A <HI>Law</HI> to which the Acts of Government &s;hould be conform'd. A Law, &s;ays <HI>Mare&s;ius,</HI> <Q><HI>E&s;t faciendorum &amp; fugiendorum nor|ma, &s;ub Ratione praemii et Paenae. i. e.</HI> It is the Rule of Things to be done and avoided, on Con&s;ideration of a Reward or Puni&s;hment.</Q> All Ju&s;tice and e&s;pecially Di&s;tri|butive, has re&s;pect to a Law; this is the Foundation on which it is Built, and Rule according to which it mu&s;t be &s;quar'd and accommodated.</P>
<P>Now the Law that is the Ground and Foundation of Ju&s;tice among Men, mu&s;t have the following Characters, viz. 1&s;t. It mu&s;t be bottom'd upon natural Equity, upon the Nature, Relation and Rea&s;on of Things: Otherwi&s;e it will be a crooked Rule, and &s;o unworthy of Ob&s;ervati|on. No human Authority can alter the intrin&s;ick Goodne&s;s and Badne&s;s of Things; and therefore bad Laws (in a moral Sen&s;e) are but a recommending and enforcing Iniquity by human Authority. And 2dly. The <HI>Law</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>enacted</HI> by <HI>competent Power</HI> and Authority; becau&s;e Legi&s;lation, as well as the Execution thereof, are Acts of Government,
<PB N="279" REF="005500_0282_1039658A9EC57100">
which tho&s;e that exerci&s;e &s;hould have a Right &s;o to do, either originally or by Delegation: The Contrary to which tends to open a Scene of Confu&s;ion and Blood. And hence it is well ob&s;erv'd by &s;ome, that however ju&s;t any Act of Government be in it&s;elf, yet it is unju&s;t for tho&s;e to meddle with it that have no Right thereto, <HI>e. g.</HI> For a Judge to condemn one Guilty of a Capital Crime to Death is Ju&s;t; but for a private Per&s;on dive&s;ted of Authority to do it, is Murder!</P>
<P>And 3dly. The <HI>Law</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>promulgated</HI> that it may be known; <HI>for where there is no Law there is no Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> Rom. iv. 15. But the</P>
<P N="2">2d. Particular that Civil Ju&s;tice, or Ju&s;tice among Men includes, is <HI>Conformity</HI> to the Law in all Admini&s;trations. When a Judge doth this, in all his Enquiries and Exami|nations re&s;pecting Ca&s;es brought before him, he does his Duty, and otherways he perverts the Ways of Judgment. It is this Kind of Ju&s;tice among Men, that is an Emblem or Shadow of the Ju&s;tice of God, and therefore I have &s;o long di&s;cours'd upon it! But to &s;hew the Similitude, let me add a few Words more, and enquire what is God's Declarative or Relative Ju&s;tice, but his Conformity to the Law, he has given his Creatures in his Tran&s;actions with them. Here ob|&s;erve. 1&s;t. That the Law which God gave to Man to direct him in his Service is grounded on natural Equity, or the nature and rea&s;on of Things; which appears by the Harmony of its Precepts among them&s;elves, and their direct Tendency to promote the Glory of God, and make the Creature happy in his Service. The Contraries to which tend to di&s;honour God, deba&s;e our intelligent Nature, and de&s;troy our Hap|pine&s;s. The moral Law is but a Tran&s;cript of the divine Nature as far as it is imitable. And hence is the Apo&s;tles ju&s;t commendatory Encomium concerning it. <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. 12. <HI>Wherefore the Law is Holy, and the Commandment Holy; and
<PB N="280" REF="005500_0283_10396589027FD8C8">
ju&s;t and Good.</HI> And 2dly. That God had Authority to enact Laws, appears evidently from his creating all. As his infinite and eternal Excellency makes him worthy of ab|&s;olute Sovereignty and Dominion, &s;o his producing all by his Almightine&s;s, gives him an irrefragable Right thereto. Hu|man Power is deriv'd, delegated and limitted, but his is Ori|ginal and Ab&s;olute. And 3dly. Almighty God having a|nex'd the Sanction of Rewards and Puni&s;hments to the Law he has given his Creatures: His Truth &s;tands engag'd to execute the &s;ame upon &s;uitable Objects; which is like|wi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the De&s;ign of Government. This Execution therefore of the Sanction of the Law, or con|formity thereto, in the Dealings of God with his Creatures, is his declarative Ju&s;tice, and with this even all his Acts of Sovereignty do really harmonize; which appears by con|&s;idering,</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Properties of divine Ju&s;tice, which are the&s;e following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P N="4">4th. Propos'd. <HI>viz.</HI> The Di&s;plays of divine Ju&s;tice; and here to be as brief as I can, I &s;hall only mention two In|&s;tances thereof. The Fir&s;t of which, was the Sufferings our LORD endur'd, when he &s;tood in a Sinners Room and Place: How un&s;peakable were the Tortures he endur'd in his &s;a|cred Body, every Part of which was put to exqui&s;ite Pain!
<PB N="282" REF="005500_0285_1039658593557298">
Deep Furrows were made in his &s;acred Back by cruel Scour|ges, and his beauteous Face expos'd to contemptuous Blows, yea to Shame and Spitting, by the in&s;ulting Herd, his vene|rable Temples were pierc'd by Thorns, his Side and Heart by a Spear, the whole Weight of his Body, hung upon a few Sinewy and &s;en&s;ible Parts in his Crucifixion, and his Name was treated with the greate&s;t Ignominy and Scorn. But as Mr. <HI>Flavel</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <Q>The Soul of our Lord's Sufferings was his Sufferings in his Soul.</Q> When he who knew no Sin, was made Sin for us. His Soul was made an Of|fering for Sin, his Soul became &s;orrowful even unto Death. How unconceiveable mu&s;t be the Angui&s;h, which our LORD endur'd in his Soul, when at one In&s;tant of Time, that whole Weight of Di&s;tre&s;s and Pain, which was due to di|vine Ju&s;tice, for all the Sins of the elect World was laid upon it? And in the mean Time de&s;erted by the Father in re&s;pect of his comfortable Pre&s;ence.

<P N="2">2dly. The vindictive Ju&s;tice of God, has a dreadful Di&s;|play in the Torments of the Damned, who are puni&s;h'd with everla&s;ting De&s;truction, from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power. As the Damned are depriv'd of all the Honours and Comforts of the Heavenly Paradi&s;e. As they are burnt in a Lake of Fire, which is kindled by the

<P N="5">5th. Propos'd, which was to an&s;wer &s;ome Objections offered again&s;t the Ju&s;tice of God. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It is objected by the <HI>Socinians,</HI> that according to our Doctrine God, puni&s;h'd the Innocent in the Room of the Guilty, namely our Saviour in the Place of Sinners.</P>
<P>An&s;. <HI>Tho' our Saviour was per&s;onally innocent, yet he was with his own Con&s;ent, and by his Fathers Imputation, guilty. And hence he is &s;aid</HI> to be made Sin for us, <HI>he willingly became the Sinners Surety, and &s;o a&s;&s;umed their Guilt, in order to &s;a|tisfy for it, and &s;ave them from Ruin, and to a willing Per&s;on who had a Right to di&s;po&s;e of his own Life, e&s;pecially &s;eeing &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aluable an End was an&s;wered by it, as the Salvation of Sin|ners, no Injury was done, by his Father in puting him to Death.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is Objected that God &s;ometimes puni&s;hes the Sins of the Parents in their Children. <HI>Ex.</HI> xx. 5.</P>
<P>An&s;. <HI>God never puni&s;hes the Sins of the Parents in inno|cent Children. As to the Sin of</HI> Adam <HI>he being the federal Head, or covenant Repre&s;entative of his whole Offspring, they &s;inned in him.</HI> Ho&s;. vi. 7. <HI>But they like</HI> Adam <HI>(as the Words &s;hould be rendred) have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Covenant.</HI> Rom. v. 12. Wherefore as by one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, and &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, for that all have &s;inned (<HI>i. e. in</HI> Adam) <HI>And as to the Sins of private Parents, they are not puni&s;h'd in Children, unle&s;s they be pro|pen&s;e to them, or imitate them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. It is objected that God is a Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons in the Affair of Prede&s;tination, by di&s;pen&s;ing unequal Things
<PB N="284" REF="005500_0287_103965826D52A558">
to tho&s;e that were in an equal State, choo&s;ing one, and re|jecting another, without any Rea&s;on but his own Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>An&s;. <HI>To re&s;pect Per&s;ons, is when in Matters of Judgment, equal Things according to Law and Right are due to &s;everal Per&s;ons, and yet we di&s;pen&s;e unequal: But this is not the Ca&s;e with the Almighty.</HI> Who hath given to him, <HI>&s;ayeth the Apo&s;|tle,</HI> and it &s;hall be repay'd, for of him are all Things. <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 36. <HI>As to God's Grace, he owes it to no Creature as &s;uch. He is Lord of his own Trea&s;ures, and may do with his own what he plea&s;es.</HI> Rom. ix. 18, 21. <HI>And therefore &s;uch as Favour the Objection, do but reply again&s;t God, as the Apo&s;tle there ob&s;erves. Prede&s;tination is but an immanent Act of God, which produces nothing without him&s;elf, and con&s;equently di&s;|pen&s;es neither Good nor Evil, tho' it be the Pattern according to which his Providence di&s;pen&s;es all Things in Time. But if we con&s;ider God's Providence, which di&s;pen&s;es Salvation and Damnation, that does not confer unequal Things upon tho&s;e that are equal. But it confers unequal Things upon tho&s;e that are unequal,</HI> viz. <HI>Believers and Unbelievers. For CHRIST's Sake Salvation to the Former, and for Sins Sake, Damnation to the Latter. If a Prince of a Number of Rebels, who all according to Law de&s;erve Death, purpo&s;es and pa&s;&s;es an Act of Pardon upon &s;ome to &s;hew his Clemency, and lets the Law take place upon others to &s;hew his Ju&s;tice, where is the Wrong? And that is the Ca&s;e, for God in his Purpo&s;es look'd upon Men as fallen, and meriting his Di&s;plea&s;ure, he might have left the whole Race to peri&s;h for their Sins with the Devils, who after their Fall had never an offer of Mercy. And becau&s;e Jehovah has cho&s;en &s;ome, when he might have condemned all,</HI> &s;hall our Eye be Evil becau&s;e God is Good?</P>
<P N="4">4thly. It is objected that God &s;uffers the Wicked to pro&s;per, and the Pious to be afflicted and oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>And &s;hall fear the Lord, and his Goodne&s;s, in the latter Days.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AFTER the Prophet had in the Preceeding Ver&s;es, repre&s;ented the bad Characters of the People of <HI>I&s;|rael,</HI> under the Similitude of an adulterous Wife, as well as the low Condition, they &s;hould be reduc'd to on this Account, by their Captivity and other In&s;tances of God's controver&s;y with them: He in the Words of our Text, prophe&s;ies of a ble&s;&s;ed Reformation; that &s;hould be wrought upon them <HI>in the latter Days.</HI></P>
<P>By the <HI>latter Days</HI> we are to under&s;tand the Days of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> or the Time of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, and proba|bly the latter Part of this Time: Then we are told, that the Jews &s;hould reverence God, <HI>becau&s;e of his Goodne&s;s.</HI> We mu&s;t admire and adore the Goodne&s;s of God, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did when this Name was proclaimed. (<HI>Ex.</HI> xxxiv. 6.) <Q>And fear the Guilt of unkind Returns.</Q> The Con&s;ideration of God's Goodne&s;s, &s;hould make us afraid of offending him, which &s;o gro&s;ly violates the Laws of Gratitude. And hence the P&s;almi&s;t ob&s;erves, <HI>that there is Forgivene&s;s with God, that he may be fear'd.</HI> P&s;. cxxx. 4. This Prophe&s;y had its Ac|compli&s;hment in the early Times of the Go&s;pel, when thro' the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, upon the Mini&s;try of the Apo&s;tles,
<PB N="293" REF="005500_0296_103965736923A1A8">
great Numbers both of Jews and Gentiles were brought to believe in JESUS. And hereby to fear God, becau&s;e of his <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> more e&s;pecially apparent in the Redemption of Mankind, by the Sufferings and Obedience of the Son of God the &s;piritual <HI>David!</HI> But &s;ome do probably (at lea&s;t) ex|pect a farther Accompli&s;hment of this Prophe&s;y, in Time coming, agreeable to the Words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>When the Fullne&s;s of the Gentiles is brought in, then all I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI></P>

<ITEM>II. Upon the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> And then proceed to the Im|provement.</ITEM>

<P>That God is truly and &s;upreamly Good, the &s;acred Scrip|tures Te&s;tify various Ways, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. <HI>Effectively,</HI> when it a&s;&s;erts that all the Works of God are good. <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 31. <HI>And God &s;aw every Thing that he had made and behold it was very good.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3dly. <HI>Negatively,</HI> When it denies that there is any Evil in him. <HI>P&s;.</HI> xcii. 15. <HI>He is my Rock and there is no Unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s in him. (Deut.</HI> xxxii. 4.)</P>

<P>And Rea&s;on likewi&s;e confirms the &s;ame Truth, by a&s;&s;erting 1&s;t. That God is a Being, and therefore Good: For <HI>Being</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> are concertible Terms among Philo&s;ophers: Yea that he is the fir&s;t and chief Being, and therefore the fir&s;t and chief Good.

Creatures, (for none of them has his Goodne&s;s of him&s;elf.) So he contains all the Kinds of Good in him, <HI>viz.</HI> Plea&s;ant, profitable, hone&s;t. In re&s;pect of <HI>plea&s;ant Good,</HI> the P&s;almi&s;t bids us <HI>ta&s;te and &s;ee that he is good,</HI> P&s;. xxxiv. And he tells us <HI>that in his Pre&s;ence is fullne&s;s of Joy, and at his Right Hand Plea&s;ures for ever more, P&s;.</HI> xvi. 11. In re&s;pect of <HI>pro|fitable Good,</HI> he diffu&s;es his Kindne&s;s among his Creatures, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him we po&s;&s;e&s;s all be&s;ides him, and more than all! In re&s;pect of <HI>hone&s;t Good,</HI> God is by his Sanctity the original Rule and Pattern, of all that Holine&s;s that is in Creatures. Hence &s;ayeth <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> <Q>God only is im|mutably Good, he only is the Good of all Good, he only is the Cau&s;e of all Goodne&s;s, to all that are Good. There would be no communicable good Things (&s;aid he) if there was not an incommunicable Good.</Q> And there|fore God is Good in three Re&s;pects, viz. 1&s;t. By his <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> that is originally, the Foundation of Goodne&s;s, whereas Crea|tures are only good by Participation, as Streams running from the Fountain. 2dly. God is good by <HI>Efficiency,</HI> ina&s;much as he only can communicate Good independently, whereas Creatures only &s;o far as they are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his Power, and excited by his Influence. 3dly. God is good by <HI>Exi&s;tence,</HI> ina&s;much as he only is a Good nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;ting, whereas all Creatures are but contingently good, and exi&s;t by the meer Will and Plea&s;ure of God. This Truth the Gentile Philo&s;o|phers acknowledged. <Q>There is no good Mind without God, &s;ayeth Seneca.</Q>
<Q>Vertue is not in us by Nature, but by divine Providence, &s;ayeth <HI>Plato.</HI></Q> The Jews were likewi&s;e of the &s;ame Sentiment. Hence <HI>Philo, one is good</HI> meaning God, who was wont to be call'd by them <Q>one without Addition.</Q></P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing upon this <HI>Attribute</HI> of divine Goodne&s;s, I &s;hall enquire into its <HI>Nature, Kinds</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> and con|&s;ider

the Force of &s;ome <HI>Objections</HI> again&s;t it, and then pro|ceed to the <HI>Improvement,</HI> after &s;ome brief Hints premis'd, re&s;pecting the other general Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>viz. The Fear of God,</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>Good</HI> according to <HI>Ari&s;totles</HI> Definition, is that which all de&s;ire. But it is more accurately defin'd by others, thus, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That it is that which for the Perfection of its Na|ture de&s;erves to be de&s;ired, and is communicative of it&s;elf.</Q> So that three Things are included in it <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. An e&s;&s;en|tial <HI>Excellency</HI> or Perfection, for which it merits De&s;ire and pur&s;uit. 2dly. A <HI>Faculty</HI> of communicating this Perfecti|tion to others, on this Account its call'd profitable. And 3dly. The <HI>Relation</HI> of both the Former to the Appetite or De&s;ire, on which Account it is call'd de&s;ireable. And hence &s;ome learned Men ob&s;erve that Good is threefold, <HI>viz. Meta|phy&s;ical, Phy&s;ical, Ethical.</HI> Or in more plain Terms, it may be call'd a <HI>Good</HI> of Being, U&s;e and Manners. And 1&s;t. <HI>Metaphy&s;ical Good,</HI> or the Good of Being, is that Perfection, which is communicated to every Being by its Cau&s;e, or it is that Excellency which every Being obtains, as it is a Being: For which it may be de&s;ir'd. This has no Evil oppos'd to it, and only &s;erves to &s;hew the Pre-eminence of Exi&s;tence, to Non-Exi&s;tence, or Being to no Being. 2dly. <HI>Phy&s;ical Good,</HI> or the Good of U&s;e, is that Perfection or Excellen|cy, by which any being de&s;ign'd for another's U&s;e, is fit|ted for it, whether the U&s;e be General or Particular! Every Creature in its original Con&s;titution was fitted for this two|fold U&s;e, it not only &s;erv'd to compleat and adorn the whole Sy&s;tem of Things, but al&s;o for Food, or Medicine, or &s;ome of the U&s;es of human Life: And in this Sen&s;e all Things at their Creation were call'd <HI>Good;</HI> and to this Kind of Good is oppos'd, what&s;oever is Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it, Unprofitable, or Hurtful. 3d. <HI>Ethical</HI> or <HI>moral Good,</HI> or the Good of Manners, con&s;i&s;ts

in the <HI>Rectitude</HI> of a rea&s;onable Creature, or in its <HI>Conformi|ty</HI> to <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Law;</HI> and to this Vice and Sin is oppos'd: And hence we call a holy Man, a <HI>good Man:</HI> and on the Contrary one who goes on in a Cour&s;e of Sinning a <HI>Bad-Man.</HI></P>
<P>Having offer'd the&s;e few Hints concerning the Gene|ral Nature of Good, I proceed to ob&s;erve more particular|ly concerning the divine Goodne&s;s, that it is no other then his Perfection, by which he can communicate him&s;elf, and for which he de&s;erves and ought to be de&s;ir'd, and there|fore it includes the&s;e three following Particulars in it, namely 1&s;t. His infinite <HI>Perfection,</HI> which appears to us from all his Attributes, by which he is &s;ufficient for him&s;elf, and his Creatures, and that to infinite Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. (<HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 1.) By this he is good in him&s;elf, yea Goodne&s;s it&s;elf. (<HI>P&s;a.</HI> xxv. 8.) And free from every Evil. (<HI>Deut.</HI> xxxii. 4.) And 2dly.

A <HI>Relation</HI> or <HI>Suitablene&s;s,</HI> which ari&s;es from the two former Particulars mentioned, for which the Almighty de&s;erves to be &s;ought after, and de&s;ir'd by all in|telligent Beings, with the utmo&s;t Inten&s;ene&s;s and Vehemence. <HI>P&s;.</HI> lxiii. 1.2. <HI>O God thou art my God, early will I &s;eek thee, my Soul thir&s;teth for thee.&mdash;To &s;ee thy Power and thy Glo|ry as I have &s;een thee in the Sanctuary.</HI> But I proceed to con&s;ider the</P>
<P N="2">2d. Propos'd, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Kinds of divine Goodne&s;s.</HI> And here it may be ob&s;erv'd, that the Goodne&s;s of God is Two|fold, viz. <HI>Imanent,</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ient,</HI> or <HI>E&s;&s;ential</HI> and <HI>Rela|tive.</HI> Now God's <HI>Imanent</HI> or <HI>e&s;&s;ential Goodne&s;s,</HI> is no o|ther then his perfect E&s;&s;ence or Being. Whereas the <HI>tran&s;ient Goodne&s;s</HI> of God, con&s;i&s;ts in the Manife&s;tation of the Former to, or in created Beings, and is Three-fold

God's <HI>Common Goodne&s;s</HI> con|&s;i&s;ts in conferring common Benefits upon the Children of Men without Di&s;tinction, whether they be Elect or Repro|bates: And hence God is call'd the Saviour of all Men, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe. (1 Tim. iv. 10. See al&s;o Rom. ii. 4.) And 3dly. The <HI>&s;pecial Goodne&s;s</HI> of God con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;pen&s;ing &s;aving Gifts upon the Elect.

The</P>
<P N="3">3d. Propos'd comes next to be con&s;idered, which was to di&s;cour&s;e upon the <HI>Properties of divine Goodne&s;s:</HI> Now the <HI>imanent,</HI> or <HI>e&s;&s;ential Goodne&s;s</HI> of God, hath the fol|lowing Properties, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t.

The <HI>imanent Goodne&s;s</HI> of God is mo&s;t <HI>Simple,</HI> with|out any Mixture of Imperfection or Defect, it is pure Good|ne&s;s without the lea&s;t Alay: And hence he is &s;aid to <HI>be Light, in which there is no Darkne&s;s at all,</HI> 1 Joh. i. 5.

Whereas the Goodne&s;s of Creatures is &s;omething added to their Being, and &s;o acciden|tal and &s;eparable. God is Good originally by his own Good|ne&s;s; whereas all Creatures are good by Participation: They have but a deriv'd Dependant, and precarious Good|ne&s;s: They them&s;elves are like <HI>to Vanity, who&s;e Days are as a Shadow, that pa&s;&s;eth away, P&s;.</HI> cxliv. 4.

with whom is no Variablene&s;s or Shadow of turning.</HI> 2dly. The <HI>tran&s;ient Goodne&s;s</HI> of God, is <HI>exemplary;</HI> as it is the Fountain from which all created Goodne&s;s flows, &s;o it is the <HI>Patern</HI> according to which it is to be regulated: And hence we are bid to <HI>be Merciful as our heavenly Father is Merciful. Jehovah</HI> repre&s;ents his infinite Perfection as it were by Parts in his Works; as rea&s;onable Creatures bear its Image, <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 26.

But I pa&s;s on to the</P>
<P N="4">4th. General Head, which was to con&s;ider &s;ome <HI>Objections</HI> again&s;t this Attribute. And 1&s;t. It is objected, that God hath &s;aid he will &s;hew him&s;elf froward with the Froward <HI>P&s;.</HI> xviii. 26. <HI>An&s;.</HI> the Scope of the Place is only to &s;ignify that God will accommodate his Righteous judgments, to the perver&s;e Practi|ces of ob&s;tinate Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. He will proportion Pains to their Pre&s;umptuous Impieties, and thus wherein they dealt proudly he will be above them.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is objected, that God is not de&s;ired by all, nay that many labour to bani&s;h the Thoughts of him out of their Minds. <HI>An&s;.</HI> It is true, but the Rea&s;on why he is not &s;ought after by all intelligent Beings, is not any want of Goodne&s;s in him, but the <HI>Blindne&s;s</HI> of Creatures, whereby they di&s;cern not his Tran&s;cendent Amiablene&s;s, or their <HI>Guilt,</HI> whereby they fear and &s;hun him, as Criminals an avenging Judge! A</P>
<P N="3">3d, Objection is this, That God does not impart his Good|ne&s;s to all, to Reprobates; whereas Goodne&s;s is communica|tive of it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="005500_0303_103966B7EC4CCA30"><HI>An&s;.</HI> He does communicate his Goodne&s;s to all, but freely, according to his own good Plea&s;ure, in re&s;pect of the <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>degree</HI> of <HI>Good.</HI> He is Lord of his own Trea&s;ures, and may do with them what he plea&s;es, without being account|able to any. For as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>Who hath fir&s;t given to him, and it &s;hall be recompen&s;ed to him again?</HI> God is &s;o far Good to all, that he &s;upports, pre&s;erves and nouri&s;hes them &s;o long as they continue, and confers upon them whatever they enjoy, and that without their demerit. But he is by his E&s;&s;ence Good, and therefore cannot but be aver&s;e to evil, and tho&s;e that are under the Government of it: And therefore cannot have Fellow&s;hip with them, while they continue &s;uch.

<P N="2">2d General Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, viz. <HI>the Fear of God.</HI> Which may be thus de&s;crib'd, viz. <HI>That it is a Reverence of God, ari&s;ing from a View of his Attributes, and a Sen&s;e of his Love, di&s;po&s;ing us to honourable Sentiments of Jehovah in our Minds, as well as to expre&s;s the &s;ame by our Lips, and e&s;pecially by the cour&s;e of our Practice, to do tho&s;e Things that we know are plea&s;ing to him, and carefully to avoid the con|trary.</HI> Here ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That there can be no true <HI>Fear of God</HI> without the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of him. And this Knowledge mu&s;t be experi|mental and practical, &s;uch as is formed in us by the Holy Spirit's &s;pecial Concurrence, with the u&s;e of proper Means. Such as proceeds from Faith in God thro' a Mediator, and has influence upon the Mind and Life! When we have a believing View of the infinite Excellency of the &s;upream Being by Faith, then, and not before, we are inclin'd to entertain high and becoming Thoughts of God, and to ex|pre&s;s the &s;ame in our Speech and Behaviour.

from a view of his Excellency, and partly from a Sen&s;e of his Love to us. Hence the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> ob&s;erves, that <HI>we love him, becau&s;e he loved us fir&s;t.</HI> Now a tran&s;cendent Love to God, &s;weetly con&s;trains us, by the ingenuous Bonds of Gratitude, to <HI>fear God</HI> becau&s;e of his Goodne&s;s, as our Text a&s;&s;erts. But particularly in the</P>
<P N="3">3d Place it may be ob&s;erv'd, that there be two ingre|dients in the afore&s;aid <HI>Reverence of God,</HI> viz. a <HI>fear to of|fend</HI> him by any Sin, and a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to plea&s;e</HI> him by every Duty; on which Account the whole Wor&s;hip of God is &s;ometimes in Scripture &s;ignify'd by <HI>the fear of God.</HI> Hence it is &s;aid of <HI>Job, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eared God, and e&s;chewed Evil.</HI></P>
<P>Now the <HI>fear of God</HI> is twofold, viz. either <HI>Servile</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Filial.</HI> The <HI>Servile Fear of God,</HI> is when we are afraid to offend God, chiefly becau&s;e of the <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> con&s;equent upon it. And this, when it is attended with &s;ome Hope of Mercy, is profitable, as a preparative of Order to Con|ver&s;ion, but when accompany'd with De&s;pair, it is hurtful. But a <HI>filial fear</HI> ari&s;es from Love, and &s;weetly allures us to &s;erve God, and makes us afraid of his Anger as ingenuous Children. The Characters of this Kind of Fear, are the&s;e following. 1&s;t. It makes tho&s;e that have it Con&s;cientious in the general Cour&s;e of their Practice, to avoid every Evil, &s;ecret as well as open, &s;mall as well as great, fa&s;hionable and creditable Evils, as well as tho&s;e that are more &s;canda|lous! Yea <HI>to avoid the very Appearance of Evil,</HI> and to &s;eek the Mortification of Sin in the Heart; and all this from a hatred of Sin, chiefly becau&s;e of its vile Nature, and con|trariety to God. 2dly. It makes tho&s;e that have it, painful in the Performance of good Works, and careful that they be done in a right Manner, <HI>viz.</HI> from a right Principle, <HI>Love;</HI> to a right End, <HI>God's Glory;</HI> and by a right Rule, <HI>the Word of God,</HI> as well as with <HI>fervour</HI> and <HI>affection!</HI> Be&s;ides

it makes Per&s;ons that have it, to long after, and labour for a Perfection of Holine&s;s: From pur&s;uing which they will not be deter'd by the Fear or Hope of any Creature, or of any Evil! 3dly. Tho&s;e that fear God make mention of his Name and Attributes with religious Reverence, and read his Word with pious Solicitude. 4thly. The <HI>Fear of God</HI> is not a tran&s;ient <HI>Pang</HI> or <HI>&s;uddain fla&s;h of Devotion,</HI> but a <HI>fixed good Temper of Mind,</HI> a habitual Devotedne&s;s to God and his Service, which runs thro' the general Cour&s;e of our Affections and Actions.</P>
<P>I proceed to the Improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. From the Goodne&s;s of God, we may learn the Evil of Sin, which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> its Nature directly oppo&s;es infinite Good|ne&s;s; and, as far as it can, labours to dethrone the Almighty, and therefore it was call'd by the Antients <HI>Deicide.</HI> For <HI>Sin,</HI> poor Creatures are de&s;erted by the Almighty, who is the chief Good, and that to all Eternity. (<HI>Mat.</HI> xxv. 41.) It is <HI>Sin</HI> that robs the Soul of the good Image of God, with which it was at fir&s;t adorn'd, and renders it evil and indi&s;pos'd to any good. It is <HI>Sin</HI> that inclines tho&s;e that are under its Government, to prefer the imaginary Goodne&s;s of the Creature, to the true and infinite Goodne&s;s of the Crea|tor! It is by <HI>Sin,</HI> that we requite the chief good from whom all ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> good is deriv'd, with Evil! Deut. xxxii. 6. <HI>Do ye thus requite the Lord O fooli&s;h People and unwi&s;e!

Should not therefore the Con&s;ideration of divine Goodne&s;s, induce or lead us to Re|pent of Sins pa&s;t, and to hate and &s;hun every future Evil, and to &s;eek a remedy again&s;t it in CHRIST JESUS, in whom alone the &s;pecial Goodne&s;s of God is di&s;play'd to fallen Man|kind.

Is not the Mi&s;ers Love to Gold enflamed by a fre|quent viewing of it? And let us dear Brethren humbly pray, and earne&s;tly labour to be more and more firmly fix'd, in the believing Per&s;wa&s;ion of God's infinite Goodne&s;s; that &s;o CHRIST may dwell in our Hearts by Faith, that being rooted and grounded in Love, <HI>we may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Height, and to know the Love of CHRIST, which pa&s;&s;es Knowledge, that we may be filled with the Fullne&s;s of God.</HI> Eph. iii. 17,&mdash;19.

In God's Goodne&s;s our Happine&s;s is to be only &s;ought: For indeed it can be only found therein. Here we may behold our <HI>ob|jective</HI> Happine&s;s, or that Good that makes us happy: Not a created Good as &s;ome <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> of old, have vainly dream'd. No! But an uncreated, independent and infinite Good, who as a <HI>Shield</HI> can turn away all Evil from us, and as a Sun can communicate all Good to us. And here we may like|wi&s;e behold our <HI>Formal</HI> Happine&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts in Union to, Communion with, and the Enjoyment of this chief and infinite Good. Hence the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> pronounces <HI>that People ble&s;&s;ed who&s;e God is the Lord.</HI> (P&s;al. xxxiii. 12.) And how &s;weetly does devout <HI>Heman</HI> triumph, on this Account, P&s;a. lxxii. 25. <HI>Who have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee.</HI> The chief Good hath certainly the chief Dignity and Excellency, and therefore de&s;erves the fir&s;t Place in our Thoughts, De&s;ires and La|bours. And is not &s;ecuring of Happine&s;s the great De&s;ign
<PB N="307" REF="005500_0310_103966AC73DB5460">
Life, next to the Glory of God, after which there is in all a natural De&s;ire. Now is it not evident from the very Na|ture of Things, that that cannot be found in any created Good? Becau&s;e it is gro&s;s and limited, and &s;o unequal to the Nature and De&s;ires of the Soul. Surely therefore all the Lines of Life, that do not tend to God as their Center are crooked, and be&s;ides the Mark. Let us then turn our Eyes and Hearts from Creatures to the great and good God, and &s;eek for Re&s;t and Happine&s;s in him alone; his Good|ne&s;s can only yield the &s;olid Satisfaction we in vain &s;eek and expect el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The infinite Goodne&s;s of God, affords Occa&s;ion of glorifying him after the Example of many of his mo&s;t emi|nent Servants, particularly of <HI>David,</HI> P&s;a. cvi. 1. <HI>Prai&s;e ye the Lord, O give Thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his Mercy endureth forever.</HI> Of <HI>A&s;aph, Heman, Jeduthun,</HI> who with their Sons and Brethren, by Cymbals, &amp; Trumpets, and other In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick, &s;ounded forth the Prai&s;es of the divine Goodne&s;s. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> v. 12, 13. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s as the Trumpeters and Singers were as one, to make one Sound to be heard in prai&s;ing and thanking the Lord, and when they lift up their Voice with the Trumpets and Cymbals, and prai&s;ed the Lord &s;aying, for he is good for his Mercy en|dureth for ever; that then the Hou&s;e was filled with a Cloud, even the Hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI> And is there not Rea&s;on why we &s;hould prai&s;e God for his Goodne&s;s, when we con&s;ider that it is a Property, whereby he e&s;pecially communicates and com|mends him&s;elf to Creatures, a Property which mo&s;t nearly touches us, &amp; therefore &s;hould con&s;train us to grateful Emotions.

<P>But in the next Place, let me intreat you, my dear Bre|thren, to imitate the Goodne&s;s of God. The P&s;almi&s;t gives us a &s;ummary of the divine Goodne&s;s, P&s;al. cxix 68. <HI>Thou art Good and doe&s;t Good,</HI> i. e. Good by an intrin&s;ick and imanent Perfection, in which re&s;pect God is lovely and lov'd by him&s;elf, as well as communicative of him&s;elf, and &s;o to be de&s;ired by all. Be&s;ides he does Good, he di&s;tributes his Goodne&s;s among Creatures both Good and Evil, tho' in a different Manner and Degree. Now let us endeavour to imitate this noble Example. 1&s;t. By being Good, i. e. fit for the u&s;e to which we were created; and what was that U&s;e, but to <HI>know, love</HI> and <HI>glorify</HI> our Creator here, in or|der to enjoy him eternally! And what does <HI>fitne&s;s</HI> for it con|&s;i&s;t in, but in the Image of God, after which Man was at fir&s;t created, <HI>viz.</HI> The Wi&s;dom of the Under&s;tanding, the Holine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Will, and Harmony of the Affections!

or original Righteou&s;ne&s;s being lo&s;t, by our Violation of the Covenant of Works, we are thereby render'd <HI>unprofitable Servants,</HI> unfit for our U&s;e, and &s;o altogether Evil. And therefore before we can imitate God aright, we mu&s;t obtain, by Regeneration, the Image of God, which we have lo&s;t by Sin. And being Regenerated we mu&s;t more and more a|bandon Evil, and learn to do Well, by progre&s;&s;ive Sanctifi|cation. 2dly. After we are made Good, we mu&s;t endeavour to do Good, agreeable to the De&s;ign or U&s;e of our Crea|tion. <HI>Towards God,</HI> by fearing of him, tru&s;ting in him, by Love and Obedience: <HI>Towards our Neighbour,</HI> by diffu|&s;ing our Goodne&s;s upon all, Good and Bad, Friends and Enemies, but not in a like Degree: By this Imitation of the divine Goodne&s;s, we &s;hall &s;hew our&s;elves to be the ge|nuine Children of our Father which is in Heaven: By this we &s;hall have a certain Argument within our&s;elves, of our Re&s;toration to the divine Image: And by this we &s;hall re&s;emble the ble&s;&s;ed God in his mo&s;t perfect Property, and &s;o be made Partakers of the divine Nature! By this we &s;hall glorify Jehovah's Name, and many Ways promote his Kingdom: And by this, thro the gracious Promi&s;e of God, our Comforts will be encrea&s;ed in this Life, and the De|gree of our Happine&s;s in that to come.</P>
<P>What was &s;aid before concerning the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> &s;hould excite you my dear Brethren, to examine your&s;elves impar|tially thereby: for thus you will know your pre&s;ent State towards God, whether it be good or bad, which ye cannot but know is of great importance, both to your Comfort and Safety.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be&s;eech you, Sirs, as a Me&s;&s;enger of God, and command you in his Name and by his Authority, to fear Jehovah. To this ye may be excited by the following Mo|tives, 1&s;t. It is equal and Rea&s;onable: If Reverence and

The Cloud was doubtle&s;s &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Symbol or Token of the divine Pre&s;ence! Proba|bly Jehovah made a Cloud his Pavilion in order to affect <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> with with an awful Reverence of his Maje&s;ty and Glory, and to let him know, that tho' &s;omewhat of God was reveal'd to him, yet that much more was conceal'd from him! But from the whole we may learn this profitable Le&s;&s;on, viz. <HI>That it is only in the Way of Obedience that we can rea&s;onably expect the Intimations of God's gracious Pre|&s;ence!</HI> In the Words of our Text it is more particularly ob|&s;erv'd, <HI>that the Lord proclaimed his Name:</HI> Doubtle&s;s this Repetition is to &s;ignify to us, the great Importance of the Thing &s;poken. Now in the Proclamation two Things may
<PB N="312" REF="005500_0315_103966A3E8D44540">
be taken Notice of, viz. the <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Matter</HI> of it. And 1&s;t. As to the <HI>Manner</HI> or Time, it was while <HI>the Lord pa&s;&s;ed by before him.</HI> The Apprehen&s;ions we have of God in this World are &s;hort and tran&s;ient, full and fixed Views are re|&s;erv'd for a future State. But 2dly. The <HI>Matter</HI> of the Proclamation contains a Repre&s;entation both of the Great|ne&s;s and Goodne&s;s of God. And 1&s;t. We have an Account of the Greatne&s;s of God in the&s;e Words, <HI>The Lord, the Lord God.</HI> As God hath his Being of him&s;elf, and is the Fountain of Being to all Creatures, &s;o he is a Strong God, the great Original of all Power. This Declaration of God's Self-Exi&s;tence and Almightine&s;s, is prefix'd before the Di&s;|play of his Goodne&s;s, to excite a Fear and Reverence of God's Maje&s;ty, and thereby to deter from an abu&s;e of his Mercy. In the 2d Place, we have an Account of God's Goodne&s;s, in three noble In&s;tances, namely, of <HI>Mercy, Grace</HI> and <HI>Long-Sufferring.</HI> As God's Greatne&s;s is men|tioned to incite Fear, and prevent the abu&s;e of his Good|ne&s;s: &s;o is his Goodne&s;s di&s;play'd to incite Hope, which is the Spring of Action, and to allay the Terror of his Great|ne&s;s! The fir&s;t Manife&s;tation of divine Goodne&s;s here ex|pre&s;s'd is Mercy; he is <HI>Merciful,</HI> this &s;peaks his compa&s;&s;io|nate Tenderne&s;s over poor mi&s;erable Creatures, like that of a Father to his Children. This is put fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is the fir&s;t Wheel in all the In&s;tances of God's good Will to fallen Man, who&s;e Mi&s;ery makes him an Object of Pity, <HI>Jud.</HI> x. 16. 2dly. He is <HI>Gracious:</HI> This &s;peaks the Freene&s;s of God's Goodne&s;s to his Creatures, and that it is vouch&s;af'd entirely becau&s;e of his own good Plea&s;ure, and not for the Sake of any Thing in them. It is oppos'd to the Payment of a Price (<HI>Exo.</HI> xxi. 11.) as well as to Ju&s;tice and Merit. (<HI>P&s;al</HI> xxxv. 7, 19. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xix. 5.) 3dly. He is <HI>Long-&s;uffering,</HI> this &s;peaks the &s;lowne&s;s of <HI>Je|hovah</HI>
<PB N="313" REF="005500_0316_103966A21DDDB8B0">
to anger, and his deferring the Execution of de|&s;erved Vengeance upon Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. Thus God waits to be Gracious to us, and wants to be exalted that he may have Mercy upon us! The Almighty now perform'd what he had but a little time before promi&s;ed to <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> Ex. xxiii. 18 <HI>And he &s;aid, I be&s;eech thee to &s;hew me thy Glory, and he &s;aid I will make all my Goodne&s;s to pa&s;s before thee, and I will Proclaim the Name of the Lord before thee, and will be Gracious to whom I will be Gracious, and will &s;hew Mercy on whom I will &s;hew Mercy.</HI> By which we may &s;ee, that God's Goodne&s;s is his Name and Glory! that by which he will be known by his intelligent Creatures, as Men are by their Names, and that in which he Triumphs and has Com|placency! God had before made him&s;elf known to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Glory of his Self-Exi&s;tence and Self-Sufficiency, by the Name I AM THAT I AM; and now he makes him&s;elf known by the Glory of his <HI>Mercy, Grace</HI> and <HI>Long-&s;uffering.</HI></P>
<P>Now that I may di&s;cour&s;e di&s;tinctly upon tho&s;e <HI>three Attributes</HI> of God, which our Text contains, I &s;hall begin with the fir&s;t, which is <HI>his Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>The Holy Scriptures frequently a&s;&s;ert the Mercy of God. Thus he is call'd <HI>the Father of Mercies,</HI> (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 3.) He is likewi&s;e &s;aid <HI>to be abundant in Mercy,</HI> (1 Pet. i. 3.) <HI>Rich in Mercy,</HI> (Eph. ii. 4.) <HI>Of tender Mercy,</HI> (P&s;. xxv. 6.) <HI>to have Bowels of Mercy,</HI> (P&s;a. xl. 11. Luk. i. 78.) Seeing that Mercy among Men, is among the Number of Ver|tues and Perfections, in which Per&s;ons of a more generous Mind and Temper generally excell; it cannot with any &s;hadow of Rea&s;on be denied to God, who is not only in|finitely Perfect in him&s;elf, but al&s;o the Author of all that Good, that Creatures Po&s;&s;e&s;s! If any &s;hould object and &s;ay,
<PB N="214" REF="005500_0317_103966A047B6C310">
<HI>That Mercy is oppos'd to Ju&s;tice, and therefore cannot be a&s;crib'd to God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I deny it, it is not op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s'd to Ju&s;tice, as the Ver&s;e following our Text &s;hews, <HI>keeping Mercy for Thou&s;ands, and yet will by no Means clear the Guilty.</HI> God never &s;hews Mercy contrary to Ju&s;tice, as he never exerci&s;es Ju&s;tice contrary to Mercy; yea the Almighty &s;eldom or never ex|ecutes Ju&s;tice without &s;ome Preceeding Expen&s;e of Mercy, and therefore by pitying the mi&s;erable, the Lord doth not contradict his Ju&s;tice, but as it were exceed it. As if a Creditor gave a Debtor a Hundred Pounds, who owes a Thou&s;and. It is in this Sen&s;e that the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> ob|&s;erves, <HI>That Mercy rejoyceth again&s;t Judgment, (Jam.</HI> ii. 13.) 2dly. Some do object, <HI>That Mercy cannot be a&s;crib'd to God, becau&s;e it implies a Sen&s;e of anothers Mi&s;ery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It is true, Mercy is not in God, as it is in Men, by Way of Quality or Pa&s;&s;ion! For then his Simplicity and Happine&s;s would be de&s;troyed. However &s;uch a Knowledge of the Mi&s;ery of Creatures belongs to God, as inclines him to relive them! This <HI>An&s;elm</HI> &s;peaks pertinently upon in the following Manner,
<Q>Thou art Merciful O God according to us, and according to thee.&mdash;When thou beholds our Mi|&s;eries we feel the Effect of Pity, but thou do&s;t not feel the Affection of Pity!</Q></P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing upon this divine Attribute of Mercy it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak upon its <HI>Nature, Kinds</HI> and <HI>Proper|ties.</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Mercy, in re&s;pect of its <HI>Nature,</HI> may be thus de|&s;crib'd, <HI>viz. That it is the Goodne&s;s of God, extended to the Mi&s;erable.</HI> Here good and bad Angels are excluded. The Good becau&s;e they are not mi&s;erable, and the Bad becau&s;e they are wholly given up to Ju&s;tice, 2 Pet. ii. 4. <HI>But God &s;pared not the Angels that &s;inned, but ca&s;t them down to
<PB N="315" REF="005500_0318_1039669EC554DE40">
Hell, and delivered them into Chains of Darkne&s;s to be re|&s;erv'd unto Judgment.</HI> Or the Mercy of God may be thus de&s;crib'd, viz. <HI>That it is that Property of the Supream Be|ing whereby he is inclin'd to &s;uccour his Creatures in Mi&s;ery, together with its kind Effects upon them.</HI> Here ob&s;erve 1&s;t. That the &s;pecial Object of Mercy, is the Creature in Mi&s;ery, and thus it is di&s;tingui&s;h'd from other Attributes. Goodne&s;s con&s;iders it's Object as <HI>Indigent,</HI> and &s;o commu|nicates needed Benefits; but Mercy con&s;iders its Object as <HI>Mi&s;erable,</HI> becau&s;e of Sin: And therefore tho' an Innocent Creature be the Object of divine Good|ne&s;s and Bounty, it's only a fallen and &s;inning Creature, that is the proper Object of God's Mercy. Grace, <HI>is Mercy or Goodne&s;s freely di&s;pens'd,</HI> and therefore it con&s;iders its Object, not only as Mi&s;erable, but Unworthy! Where|as Long-&s;uffering con&s;i&s;ts in the Su&s;pen&s;ion of merited Vengeance, and the Communication of immerited Benefits! Thus you may &s;ee that all the&s;e Attributes of the Deity, import the Communication of &s;ome Good to the Creature, and are only di&s;tingui&s;h'd in Relation to the Objects upon which they are exercis'd! Mi&s;ery is the Foil of Mercy, it can have no other Object; hence it is &s;aid <HI>Jud.</HI> x. 16. That <HI>his Soul was griev'd for the Mi&s;ery of</HI> I&s;rael! Un|doubtedly the Vertue of Mercy was in God from all Eter|nity, but there was no Room or Occa&s;ion for its Di&s;plays, till the Creatures fatal Fall from God and Mi&s;ery con&s;equent upon it, provided it an Object to be exercis'd upon. Man by Sin robb'd him&s;elf of his Beauty and Happine&s;s, and expos'd him&s;elf to all the manifold Mi&s;eries of this and the next Life. All which are included in the Sentence of Death annex'd to the Breach of the fir&s;t Covenant. As Man by Sin had lo&s;t all Right to Happine&s;s, and on the contrary, rendered him&s;elf lyable to all the Threats of the divine Law;

&s;o by this he likewi&s;e became <HI>altogether unprofitable,</HI> (Rom. iii. 12.) having lo&s;t all his original Power to glorify God by active Obedience, and thus he had no ground from him|&s;elf to expect the divine favour.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Seeing the Mi&s;ery of fallen Mankind is Two-fold, <HI>viz.</HI> Of Sin and Puni&s;hment, con&s;equently the Operations of Mercy con&s;i&s;t in affording &s;uitable Succours under the&s;e Maladies. In re&s;pect of Sin the Mercy of God &s;uc|cours in the following In&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. In <HI>reconciling Sinners to him&s;elf, by the Blood of his on|ly begotten Son</HI> 2 Cor. v. 18. <HI>For the Purcha&s;e of which Re|conciliation, the eternal Father gave his beloved Son to Shame Pain and Death.</HI> John iii. 16.

<P>In re&s;pect of Puni&s;hment, divine Mercy Succours in the following Manner.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. By bearing with the Sinner for a Time before Judgment is inflicted. <HI>Rom.</HI> ix. 22. <HI>What if God willing to &s;hew his Wrath, and to make his Power known, endur'd with much long &s;uffering, the Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath fitted to De&s;truction.</HI></P>

<P N="3"><PB N="317" REF="005500_0320_1039669B82CCACC0">3dly.

<P N="2">2dly. God's <HI>Mercy is great,</HI> and hence God is &s;aid <HI>to be plentious in Mercy,</HI> P&s;al. lxxxvi. 5. <HI>Rich in Mercy,</HI> Eph. ii. 4. And in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> li. 1.

<P>Now becau&s;e when &s;uch Things as are really or &s;eem|ingly contrary, are put together, they illu&s;trate each other. It may not be improper before I proceed to the Improve|ment of this Subject to di&s;cour&s;e upon the Severity of God in his Judgments, which is &s;eemingly oppos'd to his Mer|cy. Of this mention is made <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 22. and in many other Places of Scripture; and of this there be many Ex|amples upon &s;acred Record, &s;uch as the In&s;tances of the fallen Angels, our fir&s;t Parents, the old World, <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> the Egyptians, <HI>Korah, Dathan, Abiram, Achan, Ananias,</HI>
<PB N="321" REF="005500_0324_10396694E1970F60">
and <HI>Saphira,</HI> and many others. From which we may gather, that God's Judgments which he exerci&s;es by his Severity, are no other than &s;ingular Puni&s;hments inflicted for &s;ingular Offences. The meritorious Cau&s;e of them, is &s;ome agravated Iniquity, the Nature of which, is often pointed out by the Puni&s;hment inflicted, which is not common but &s;ingular. <HI>Adonibezeck,</HI> who had cut off the Thumbs and Great-Toes of Three&s;core and Ten Kings, was &s;erved &s;o him&s;elf. (<HI>Judges</HI> i. 6, 7.) And hence <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;ayeth con|cerning <HI>Agag, That as his Sword made Women Childle&s;s, &s;o his Mother &s;hould be Childle&s;s among Women.</HI> 1 Sam. xv. 33. Hence the Lord el&s;ewhere threatens, <HI>that tho&s;e who &s;hed the Blood of others, &s;hould them&s;elves have Blood to drink.</HI> Thus you &s;ee that the Puni&s;hment does often re&s;emble the Sin that procur'd it. Now the Judgments of God, are of various Kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> Spiritual or Bodily, Private or Pub|lick. <HI>Spiritual Judgments</HI> are &s;uch as the&s;e, <HI>viz.

from the Mercy of God, which is great above the Heavens, and mo&s;t freely di&s;pen&s;ed upon the vile&s;t Creatures! Mercy con&s;iders not what one de&s;erves, but what he needs!

</LIST></P>
<P>I return to con&s;ider the fir&s;t <HI>propos'd,</HI> which was to <HI>explain the Nature of the Grace of God.</HI> Now the Word <HI>Grace</HI> &s;ignifies &s;omething that is free, as was ob&s;erv'd in the preceeding Sermon, and it is taken two Ways, eithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for an <HI>Attribute</HI> of God, which is in God, or for the <HI>Gif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of God, which is from God. In the fir&s;t Sen&s;e the Grace of God &s;ignifies his free and &s;overeign Benevolence, by which he peculiarly favours and doth Good to his Crea|tures, whence God is call'd <HI>Gracious</HI> as in our Text, <HI>i. e.</HI> Endow'd with Grace. As from his Goodne&s;s he is call'd <HI>Good,</HI> and from his Ju&s;tice <HI>Ju&s;t.</HI> The Gifts of God, which are the Effects of the Grace that is in him, are metoni|micaly call'd Grace, e&s;pecially &s;uch of them as are Peculi|ar and Special, <HI>i. e.</HI> Such as are confer'd upon &s;ome, rather than others. Hence &s;ome Divines ob&s;erve, that the Word <HI>Grace</HI> intends either 1&s;t. The Grace freely <HI>Giving,</HI> (Matt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> xi. 26.) Which they term <HI>(Gratiam gratis dantem,)</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the free Favour of God, or the Grace freely <HI>given,</HI> (which they call <HI>Gratiam gratis datam.</HI>) And this imports any Kind of Benefit which the Almighty confers upon his Crea|tures, whether Good or Bad, which makes them not in the lea&s;t the more acceptable to God.

All the &s;aving Gifts of God, Faith, Hope&punc; Charity, by which we plea&s;e him.</P>

In the mean Time, the&s;e Things are more properly and peculiar|ly a&s;crib'd to Grace, which are different from Nature. Na|ture and Grace &s;hould not be confounded; &s;uch Things as by the kind Con&s;titution of God, belong to every Creature according to their different kinds, are not u&s;ually call'd Grace, becau&s;e, tho' they be undue, yet they belong to Na|ture.

<P N="2">2d. <HI>Propos'd,</HI> which was to &s;peak of the <HI>Kinds</HI> of <HI>Grace;</HI> and here it may be ob&s;erv'd, that Grace is Three-fold, <HI>viz. Univer&s;al, common,</HI> and <HI>&s;aving.</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>Univer&s;al Grace is that, whereby Jehovah di&s;pen&s;es natural Things upon all his Creatures,</HI> and hence he is call'd <HI>the Saviour of all Men.</HI> 1 Tim. iv. 10.

<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Common Grace con&s;i&s;ts in the Communication of mo|ral good Things upon Men promi&s;cuou&s;ly, whether they be good or bad, elect or not elect, &s;uch as natural Wi&s;dom and Pru|dence, and all the Train of moral Vertues,</HI> in which even &s;ome Pagans have excell'd. And to the&s;e we may add, all out|ward religious Priviledges and Means of Grace; together with tho&s;e tran&s;ient Effects which are &s;ometimes produced, by them upon the Unregenerate, &s;uch as &s;ome kind of Illu|mination,

and Sufferings were marvellous Di&s;plays of the Fathers pure Affection to a mi&s;erable World! 1 <HI>John</HI> vi. 10. <HI>Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and &s;ent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins.</HI> And to what el&s;e than <HI>Free Grace,</HI> can we a&s;cribe God the Father's Acceptance, of the Surety&s;hip of CHRIST in the Sinners Room and Place? Strict Ju&s;tice certainly demands per&s;onal Satisfaction; and does not the Love of CHRIST pa&s;s Knowledge, in that he who is over all God ble&s;&s;ed for ever came into a State of the lowe&s;t Aba&s;e|ment, voluntarily to &s;ave worthle&s;s Du&s;t from perpetual Ruin?

the Matter, that good Works are nece&s;&s;ary to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. (<HI>Mat.</HI> xxv. 21, 34, 35.) I proceed to the</P>

Methinks the Glory of divine Grace appears by con&s;idering the <HI>Author</HI> of it, who is a Being infinitely and invariable Happy in him&s;elf, as well as e&s;&s;entially and eternally Glorious: And &s;o neither needs the Services of Creatures, nor can be benefited by them. Our Goodne&s;s extends not to him, neither is it any Gain to the Almighty that we are Righteous. To acknowledge God's Glory, adds no more to its Lu&s;tre than &s;peaking well of the natural Sun adds to its Beauty.</P>
<P>It may be here al&s;o ob&s;erv'd, that <HI>Jehovah</HI> would have had Millions of Angels to celebrate his Prai&s;e and execute his Plea&s;ure, altho' he had made his Ju&s;tice triumph in the Ruin of the whole human Race; which certainly he might have done.

<P N="2">2dly. Let us con&s;ider the <HI>Object</HI> upon which this divine Grace is conferr'd, and we &s;hall find</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That it is <HI>Man,</HI> not Angels.

God! How amazing is the di&s;tingui&s;hing Grace of God in pa&s;&s;ing by Creatures of a higher Order, and fixing his Love upon Man?</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is <HI>Sinners,</HI> upon whom divine Grace is confer'd. Man by Creation was but Du&s;t, but by Sin he is become polluted Du&s;t, and &s;o Odious and Loath&s;ome, as well as Wretched and Mi&s;erable! And this doleful State he has wilfully brought him&s;elf into, and wilfully continues in again&s;t all the Remon&s;trances of Con&s;cience, again&s;t all the kind Importunities of a conde&s;cending God and Saviour! Man by Sin has brought this twofold Mi&s;ery upon him|&s;elf, 1&s;t. That he de&s;erves no Good. And 2dly. That he de|&s;erves all Evil! How can the&s;e de&s;erve Good at the Hand of God, who&s;e Per&s;ons and Performances are cover'd with Deformity and Pollution? Indeed we de&s;erve not the lea&s;t common Mercy, how much le&s;s then can we merit &s;pecial Benefits? <HI>Gen.</HI> xxxii. 10. <HI>I am not worthy of the lea&s;t of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth which thou ha&s;t &s;hew'd unto thy Servant!</HI> Men in a State of Nature are un|profitable Creatures, they are neither prepar'd to receive Be|nefits, nor able to prepare them&s;elves, &s;eeing they are dead in Sins and Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. And by their multiply'd Impieties they de&s;erve the divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, and provoke him to in|flict it. As they are Children of Wrath by Nature, &s;o they weary the Almighty by continued Iniquities in Practice, (<HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> ii. 3. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xliii. 24.) And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Per&s;ons to whom divine Grace is given, are Enemies to God, both in their Minds and Lives, Rom. viii. 7. <HI>The Carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t God, for it is not Subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be!</HI> Now Enmity imports a high Degree of &s;ixed and implacable Spite, O dreadful State!

<P N="4">4thly. It is generally the poorer and meaner Sort of Men, that are favour'd with divine Grace, while the Rich, Ho|nourable, and Great are pa&s;&s;ed by. Many who make a con&s;iderable Figure in the World by the Keene&s;s of their natural and acquired Endowments, and by the Splendor of their outward Circum&s;tances, who are entirely de&s;titute of &s;pecial Grace, while others who are Poor and de&s;pis'd are favour'd therewith! This Subject the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> di&s;|cour&s;es largely upon, 1 Cor. i. 26,&mdash;28. <HI>Not many Migh|ty, not many Noble are call'd, but God hath cho&s;en the fooli&s;h Things of the World, to confound the Wi&s;e, and the Weak Things of the World, to confound the Things that are Migh|ty; and ba&s;e Things of the World, and Things which are de|&s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, hath God cho&s;en; yea Things that are not, to bring to nought Things that are.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly. Many of tho&s;e to whom divine Grace is given, were before Conver&s;ion notorious Sinners, &s;ome Bla&s;phemers, Per&s;ecutors, and Injurious: The&s;e Things the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;cribes to him&s;elf, he &s;hut up many of the Saints in Pri|&s;on, con&s;ented to their Death, Puni&s;h'd them in every Sy|nagogue, compell'd them to Bla&s;pheme, and being exceed|ing mad again&s;t them, he per&s;ecuted them to &s;trange Cities (<HI>Act.</HI> xxvi. 10.11. 1 Tim. i. 13, 15.) Some, before Conver&s;ion, have been Idolaters, as the <HI>Ephe&s;ians.</HI> Some <HI>Fornicators, Adulterers, Effeminate, Abu&s;ers, of them&s;elves with Mankind, Thieves, Covetous, Drunkards, Revilers, Extortioners,</HI> &s;uch were &s;ome of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> and yet they were <HI>wa&s;h'd, &s;anctifi'd</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tifi'd</HI> 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 9.11. O rich and glorious Grace! How admirable is the Grace

of God, in the In&s;tance of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI>'s Conver&s;ion? Who tho' a Conjurer a Murderer, and one who de&s;pis'd God, and bid defiance to Heaven in Pro&s;perity, yet when in Adver&s;ity he humbled him&s;elf and made Supplication to Je|hovah, was graciou&s;ly heard and accepted. (2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxxiii. 9, 12, 13.) I &s;hall only add the famous In&s;tance of <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> who was a notorious Sinner. This poor Wo|man loved much, becau&s;e much was forgiven her; her Heart was &s;o melted with a Sen&s;e of divine Goodne&s;s, that &s;he could wa&s;h our Lords Feet with her Tears! (<HI>Luke</HI> vii.)</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Glory of divine Grace appears not only from it's <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Object,</HI> but al&s;o from the <HI>Sea&s;on</HI> in which it is vouch&s;af'd. The Almighty be&s;tows Benefits upon his People, at &s;uch Sea&s;ons, when they are mo&s;t &s;uitable. <HI>In the Mount of Difficulty and Di&s;tre&s;s, the Lord is &s;een, yea he is a very pre&s;ent Help in Trouble.</HI> When Sinners have wearied them&s;elves in the greatne&s;s of their Way, and thro' a Series of Di&s;appointments are brought to the la&s;t Extremity, the ble&s;&s;ed God manife&s;ts his Grace and Mercy! And thus when gracious Per&s;ons are encircled with manifold Mi&s;eries, outward and inward, and their &s;orrowful Hearts are ready to &s;ink into De&s;pondency, with a long continu'd oppre&s;&s;ive Weight of Woe, from which they can hardly &s;ee any way of Deliverance; they are de&s;olate and afflicted, their Hearts almo&s;t overwhelm'd, then Jehovah &s;ends Deliverance! (<HI>P&s;a.</HI> xxv. 16, 17.) <HI>And they are as tho&s;e that dream|ed.</HI> When the compa&s;&s;ionate Jehovah returns to his People, after their &s;inful Wandrings from him. O! It makes them admire the pure and glorious Riches of divine Grace! And truly the Lord teaches his People more and more of this Doctrine, namely, the freene&s;s of his Grace, while they are in the World. And</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="338" REF="005500_0341_1039667803D4F500">4thly The freene&s;s of divine Grace appears likewi&s;e from the <HI>Manner</HI> in which divine Benefits are confer'd <HI>e. g.</HI> we contribute nothing to the Change wrought upon us by Conver&s;ion.

That Alteration of Di&s;po&s;itions which is imply'd in Conver&s;ion, is not de&s;ir'd by the Sinner be|fore it; tho' unregenerate Sinners de&s;ire to be deliver'd from Mi&s;ery, yet they do not de&s;ire to be deliver'd from Sin the Cau&s;e of it! For that is as their right Eye, and right Arm! Well then &s;eeing tho&s;e Benefits whereby the Soul is &s;anctified are unde&s;erv'd, unde&s;ir'd, yea oppos'd by the unconverted, &s;urely then they mu&s;t be freely vouch&s;af'd. But</P>
<P N="5">5thly, The Riches of divine Grace appear from the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Benefits confer'd; which are attended with the&s;e two following Properties, <HI>viz. Freedom</HI> from the greate&s;t <HI>Evils,</HI> and a <HI>Right to, and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of,</HI> the greate&s;t <HI>Good.</HI> Sinners while in a State of Unregeneracy are im|mers'd in, and expos'd to the greate&s;t Evils, both moral and penal. They are under the Dominion of Sin, and all o|ver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ainted by it; and by Rea&s;on thereof they are expos'd to the Cur&s;e and Wrath of God, in this and the next World. They are in a Dungeon of Darkne&s;s and Di&s;tre&s;s, in a Pit in which there is no Water! Bound and &s;hackled with the heavy Cur&s;e of God, void of Light and Beauty, and co|ver'd with the ba&s;e&s;t Deformity! Now the Benefits of di|vine Grace, bring the Sinner from this Depth of Woe, loo&s;e his Shakles, and relea&s;e him out of Pri&s;on! Hereby he is freed from the Guilt of Sin, thro' the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST imputed to him, and hereby he is freed from the Dominion of it, thro' the &s;anctifying Influences of the

Holy Spirit; and as he is thus freed frrom the greate&s;t E|vils by divine Grace, &s;o he is thereby entitled to, and made a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the greate&s;t Good, both Phy&s;ical and moral, being made a Partaker of the divine Love, and beautified with the Divine Image, <HI>viz.</HI> Holine&s;s. By the former he is refre&s;h'd, and by the latter adorn'd. And as he is un|der the unerring Conduct and Almighty Protection of God here, &s;o he is entitled to the perfect Enjoyment of God hereafter; which is the greate&s;t Good, that it is po&s;&s;ible for a Creature to receive.

From what has been &s;aid we may learn, that all tho&s;e Doctrines which a&s;cribe any Part of our Salvation, to our Endeavours, as meritorious Cau&s;es thereof, are very derogatory to the Glory of God, and the De&s;ign of his Go&s;|pel; which is to magnify the Exceeding Riches of God's Grace! <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> i. <HI>Such who &s;eek after Righteou&s;ne&s;s as it were by the Works of the Law are not like to attain it.</HI> Ju&s;tifica|tion is not to be attain'd by a Dependance upon our Endea|vours, we mu&s;t come to God as Beggars, and ask an Alms of <HI>Free-Grace,</HI> otherwi&s;e we &s;hall be rejected.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. We &s;hould examine our&s;elves whether we are Partakers of God's &s;pecial Grace, in the In&s;tances before mentioned, of <HI>effectual Calling,</HI> Faith, Ju&s;tification, Conver|&s;ion, Adoption; have we by the&s;e Things been brought to a high prizing of CHRIST above all others, to a Child-like Familiarity with God, to a habitual holy, humble, hea|venly and loving Temper of Mind, and Cour&s;e of Behavi|our, if &s;o, let us rejoyce in CHRIST JESUS in all outward Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, let us ever admire the Sovereign and di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Grace of God; and give to God the Glory of it in Heart, Speech, and Practice.</P>
<P>But &s;uch of you as have not found the afore&s;aid Experien|ces, <HI>rejoyce not for Joy, as other People, for ye have gone a whoring from God! Let your Laughter be turn'd into Mourn|ing and your Joy into Heavine&s;s!</HI> Cry frequently and ear|ne&s;tly to God, for &s;overeign &s;aving Grace, and re&s;t in no Duties or Ordinances &s;hort of it.</P>
<P>Is the Grace of God free? Then the greate&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors &s;hould not de&s;pair of God's Mercy, tho' your Iniquities rival the Stars for Multitude, and in their Agravations are red as Crim&s;on and Scarlet, yet <HI>Free Grace</HI> can ea&s;ily blot them out, as a thick Cloud, and make them white as Snow! Therefore let &s;en&s;ible Sinners, be encouraged to come to, and believe in the God of Grace: <HI>For where Sin has a|bounded,
<PB N="343" REF="005500_0346_1039666EE9A9E4C0">
there Grace has much more abounded.</HI> The greater your Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are, the greater Glory God will get to his Grace in forgiving them! The P&s;almi&s;t was aware of this, and therefore plead with God, <HI>to pardon his Ini|quities becau&s;e they were exceeding great.</HI></P>
<P>And methinks the Doctrine of <HI>Free Grace</HI> &s;hould power|fully induce us to Humility, &s;eeing that it is God only, who has made us to differ from others, and that we have nothing but what we have receiv'd. We are his Debtors, for all we have in <HI>Hand</HI> or <HI>Hope.</HI> The Nature of Grace &s;uppo&s;es the Object, upon whom it is vouch&s;af'd, unworthy of it. A continued humbling Sen&s;e of this, would as much conduce to our Benefit, as Ornament.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing the good God is pleas'd to heap many unde|&s;erved Kindne&s;&s;es freely upon us, why &s;hould we not imi|tate his Grace, by conferring Benefits upon our fellow Crea|tures, without any regard to Dignity, or Hopes of a reward from them: By this we &s;hould glorify God and convince others that we are his Children.</P>
<P>In fine, let me in the Name of the gracious God my Lord and Ma&s;ter, earne&s;tly be&s;eech poor Sinners of every Order to ha&s;ten as for their Lives to that Fountain of Grace that is in CHRIST. Think not to put the Almighty in your Debt by your doings, for if Grace be not Free it is not Grace. Sinners abu&s;e not the Grace of God by Delays, and other Impieties, or expect his inflam'd Wrath to a|venge the Ingratitude! <HI>Let the wicked Man for&s;ake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his thot's, and turn unto God and he will have Mercy on him, and to our God for he will a|bundantly Pardon.</HI></P>
<P>I add no more at pre&s;ent, may the Almighty and gra|cious God ble&s;s his Word, that has been offer'd in his Name to our &s;pecial and enduring Benefit. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1&s;t. Propos'd, which was to &s;peak of the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>divine Patience.</HI> Here it may be ob&s;erv'd, that tho' Pati|ence and Long-&s;uffering in Creatures differ realy, for the former &s;eems only to &s;ignify our inability to puni&s;h an Offen|der, and the latter our Unwillingne&s;s to do it, when in our

Power, but in God they are the &s;ame, and can be only di&s;tingui&s;h'd, as to the Degree of Duration or Continuance. Long-&s;uffering is only a Su&s;pen&s;ion of Wrath for a longer Time: This being the Ca&s;e I &s;hall not therefore treat of them di&s;tinctly, but proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to ob&s;erve, that the Patience of God may be thus de&s;crib'd, viz. <HI>That it is a Branch of his Mercy whereby he long defers de&s;erved Wrath, and mo|derates the Executions of it in this World towards guilty Creatures.</HI> Here ob&s;erve 1&s;t. That the <HI>Object</HI> of God's <HI>Patience,</HI> is guilty Creatures. <Q>An innocent Creature cannot be the Object of it, becau&s;e avenging Ju&s;tice has no Demand upon him, he may be the Object of Goodne&s;s, but not of Long-&s;uffering and Forbearance: For Puni&s;hment cannot be &s;aid to be defer'd where it is not due.</Q>
2dly The <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Patience,</HI> are 1&s;t. God's defering the Execution of de&s;erv'd Wrath for a Time: And this proceeds neither from the Want of Power or Opportunity to puni&s;h Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors: For they are always under the Cognizance of God's Eye, and within the Reach of his Arm. He can in an In&s;tant &s;peak them to nothing by a Word, or &s;trike them dead and damned at a Blow, when and where he plea&s;es! No, his Patience is the Fruit of his Goodne&s;s, or rather as the Scripture Terms it, <HI>a Di&s;play of his Power.</HI> And hence he is &s;aid, <HI>to be &s;low to Anger and great in Power,</HI> Nahum i. 3. and Rom. ix. 22. God is &s;aid <HI>to make his Power known in enduring with much Long-&s;uffering, the Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath fitted to De&s;truction.</HI> And hence &s;ome de&s;cribe God's Patience, to be <HI>a Power of defer|ing the Execution of his Wrath.</HI> 2dly. Another Act of <HI>Patience</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the Moderation of Puni&s;hments when inflicted, &s;o that they are not equal to the de&s;ert of Sin. P&s;al. ciii. 10. <HI>He hath not dealt with us after our Sins nor rewarded us according to our Iniquities.</HI> The Almighty &s;tirs
<PB N="346" REF="005500_0349_10396669D6ABF480">
not up all his Wrath at once, but puni&s;hes gradually. He &s;tays his rough Wind in the Day of his Ea&s;t Wind, and trys Rods before he &s;ends Scorpions. But 3dly. The Place were God exerci&s;es his Patience, is this World, which is a &s;tate of Probation or Tryal, whereas the next is a &s;tate of Re|wards and Puni&s;hments. The Damned cannot be &s;aid to be the Objects of God's Patience, becau&s;e they endure the Viols of God's Vengeance, in a degree proportioned to their demerit. And altho' the Devils are not expos'd to &s;o great a Weight of Woe and Vengeance as they will be after the general Judgment; which is intimated, by their being <HI>re|&s;erved in chains under Darkne&s;s to the Judgment of the great Day.</HI> Jud. 6. As well as by their Que&s;tion to our Saviour, Mat. viii. 29. <HI>Art thou come to torment us before our Time?</HI> Yet this le&s;s degree of Puni&s;hment inflicted on them, has no where in Scripture the Denomination of <HI>Patience:</HI> It re|mains therefore that Men are the only Objects of it, and that while in this World. But</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The <HI>Time</HI> wherein <HI>Patience</HI> is exerci&s;ed, is gene|rally a long Duration, tho' not always: The ju&s;t God makes quick Work with &s;ome, and lets his terrible &s;everity &s;uddainly triumph in their ruin, as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Kora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and his Accomplices, <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira</HI> and others. But for the mo&s;t Part Jehovah &s;u&s;pends the falling Blow for a con&s;iderable Sea&s;on, even till there be no remedy! In civil Courts of Judicature, there is u&s;ually but a little Space between the Sentence and Execution, and it is but Ju&s;t it &s;hould be &s;o. But Jehovah mercifully waits, and is not &s;peedy in coming out again&s;t the Sinner. Eccle&s;. viii. 11. <HI>Sentence again&s;t an evil Work is not &s;pedily executed.</HI> The Almighty expo&s;tulates the Ca&s;e and u&s;es a variety of Methods to reclaim impenitent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, before he lets his Ven|geance light upon them to de&s;troy them. This is well re|pre&s;ented
<PB N="347" REF="005500_0350_1039666810A85010">
in the following Places of Scripture, Jer. ii. 5. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, what Iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they have gone &s;o far from me, and have walked after Vanity and become vain?</HI> Jer. viii. 6. <HI>I hearkned and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eard, but they &s;pake not aright, no Man repented him of his Wickedne&s;s, &s;aying what have I done.

<P N="2">2d. Propos'd. Now the following Particulars &s;erve as Foils to illu&s;trate the Greatne&s;s of God's Patience, in for|bearing to execute his Vengeance upon Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Let it be con&s;idered, that God is Infinite and un|&s;poted in Holine&s;s, and inflexible in his Ju&s;tice, and there|fore cannot but abhor Sin with an unalterable and eternal Antipathy. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. How great is the Offence committed again&s;t God by every Sin? Seeing that the Sinner hereby interpreta|tively, prefers Creatures, yea his Lu&s;ts before the Ble&s;&s;ed God! And therefore as much as in him lies, la|bours to dethrone the Almighty. The exceeding contrarie|ty of Sin to the untainted Purity of the divine Nature, is &s;et forth in &s;trong Terms, accommodated to our Manner of Conception in the following Places of Scripture, Amos ii. 13. <HI>Behold I am pre&s;s'd under you, as a Cart is pre&s;s'd that is full of Sheaves.</HI> Ezek. vi. 9. <HI>I am broken with their whori&s;h Heart, which hath departed from me!</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Heighnou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ome Sins above others, &s;erve to heighten our Conceptions of the divine Patience: All Iniquities are not equally aggravated, &s;ome are of a &s;lighter Tincture, and &s;ome of a crim&s;on Hue; a deep a double Dye, (I&s;a. i. 18.) And &s;uch are Sins again&s;t Light, Love, covenant Engagements, and Rebukes of Providence; and more e&s;pecially our &s;lighting and neglecting of the Lord
<PB N="348" REF="005500_0351_103966668E9F1678">
JESUS CHRIST. Hereby the deare&s;t Love is undervalu'd and the yearning Bowels of the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate pity &s;purn'd again&s;t; yea the precious Blood of the adorable <HI>Imanuel</HI> trod under Foot, O a&s;toni&s;hing mon&s;trous Ingra|titude! And more amazing Patience, that forbears executing de&s;erv'd Vengeance upon &s;uch Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors! And</P>
<P N="4">4thly. What a prodigious Number of Sins are commit|ted every Moment, yea of the vile&s;t Kind? Surely innu|merable Evils do compa&s;s us about, <HI>if the Tongue be a World of Iniquity,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> ob&s;erves, (Jam. iii. 6.) <HI>what then &s;hall be &s;aid of all the Members together;</HI> which are as &s;o many Fountains of Impiety? Who then can under&s;tand his Errors? If the mo&s;t Patient Man alive was to behold at once the Multitude of Evils which God beholds together with their Filthine&s;s: Surely if it was in his Power the World would not &s;tand many Moments! And yet the All-knowing infinitely holy God forbears bringing Judgment to the Plumet! I &s;ay forbears to &s;weep ob&s;tinate ungrateful Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors off the Stage of Time into a deluge of endle&s;s Woe and Ruin, O a&s;toni&s;h|ing Patience! Patience worthy of a God, and which none but he can exerci&s;e! Tho' Sinners as it were fly in the Face of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> run upon the thick Bo&s;&s;es of his Buck|lers, bid Defience to Omnipotence, ba&s;ely trample upon his Authority and his Love, and by every impious Art try to provoke a God to Arms, as if they were &s;tronger than he: Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, <HI>Jehovah</HI> forbears to give the fatal Blow, behold and be a&s;toni&s;h'd ye Heavens and Earth at this! And</P>
<P N="5">5thly. It adds Weight to this Argument, when we con&s;ider the Almightine&s;s of the God of Patience, how ea&s;ily, &s;peedily, and fully can he avenge all the Affronts that are ca&s;t upon his Honour, all the Inva&s;ions that are
<PB N="349" REF="005500_0352_10396664ECEC6D60">
made upon the Rights of Heaven? It co&s;t him but a Word to make the Heavens and Earth exi&s;t, one Word of <HI>Jehovah</HI> would &s;peak the Offender Dead, or make him cea&s;e to be! The Lord has a Sovereign Empire over the whole Univer&s;e, when he &s;peaks all Nature trembles before him, the Thunder of his Power who can under|&s;tand! <HI>Con&s;ider this therefore ye that forget God, lea&s;t he tear you in Pieces when there &s;hall be none to deliver. P&s;.</HI> l. 22.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. Moreover the many Mea&s;ures which divine Mer|cy u&s;es to reclaim the Impenitent by the <HI>Word, Spirit Providence,</HI> in its pro&s;perous and adver&s;e A&s;pects, may help us to admire the more at that Patience, which endures the Abu&s;e of all. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 20. <HI>Now then we are Amba&s;&s;a|dors for</HI> CHRIST, <HI>as tho' God did be&s;eech you by us, we pray you in</HI> CHRIST<HI>'S &s;tead, be ye reconcil'd to God!</HI> And</P>
<P N="7">7thly. We may add to what has been &s;aid, the inu|merable Benefits which the indulgent God without any Demerit oftentimes heaps upon the vile&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. <HI>P&s;.</HI> lxxiii. 12. <HI>Behold the&s;e are the ungodly who pro&s;per in the World, they increa&s;e in Riches!</HI> Yea how Precious and Important is the Trea&s;ure of Time which is confer'd up|on all? Be&s;ides many other Benefits which the Sea&s;on for this exerci&s;e would fail to innumerate! Re&s;pecting all which we may acco&s;t the impenitent Sinner in the Language of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans</HI> xxiv. 5. <HI>De&s;pi&s;e&s;t thou the Riches of his Goodne&s;s and Forbearance, not knowing that the Good|ne&s;s of God leadeth thee to Repentance.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8thly. The quick Di&s;patch that divine Ju&s;tice has made with &s;ome, witne&s;s <HI>Uzza, Nadab, Abihu, Achan, Herod,</HI> and divers others, who perhaps all Circum&s;tances con&s;idered have not committed greater Evils than we, is a great Illu&s;|tration of God's Long-&s;uffering towards us, Rom. xi. 22.
<PB N="350" REF="005500_0353_103966631DB7F4B8">
<HI>Behold the Goodne&s;s and Severity of God on them which fell Severity; but towards thee, Goodne&s;s, if thou continue in his Goodne&s;s, otherwi&s;e thou al&s;o &s;hall't be cut off!</HI></P>
<P N="9">9thly. Once more me thinks the Length of the Time that Patience has been exercis'd towards us, is a pregnant Argument of the Greatne&s;s and Riches of it. Has not <HI>Je|hovah</HI> re&s;train'd the Execution of his Wrath, and waited to be Gracious to &s;ome of us, this <HI>Twenty, Thirty, Forty, Fifty,</HI> or <HI>Sixty</HI> Years? While in the mean Time we have been trampling upon his awful Authority, and &s;lighting the dear Cara&s;&s;es of his manifold Mercy, O amazing Pa|tience! When the Angels &s;in'd, they were quickly ca&s;t down to Hell, and made Monuments of divine Vengeance, and behold we who have been Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors from the Womb are yet &s;pared! Surely it had been nothing but an Act of Ju&s;tice in God to have ca&s;t every Soul of us into utter Darkne&s;s, many a Year agone: And yet we are alive, and on this &s;ide the burning Lake, and have the Offers of Mercy and Salvation made to us, O the unpa|rallel'd Patience of God! O may his Long-&s;uffering lead us to Repentance, and be Salvation to us!</P>
<P>But that I may farther illu&s;trate this Argument of the <HI>Riches</HI> of <HI>divine Patience,</HI> it will not be a mi&s;s to add the following Di&s;plays thereof.</P>
<P>When our fir&s;t Parents had revolted from their Duty and Allegiance to God, by Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Covenant of Works, and we in them. Might not God in Ju&s;tice have made them and their Off-&s;pring immediately and e|ternally Mi&s;erable, without any Hopes of a Retrieve? Yes &s;urely! To what then can we a&s;cribe the Delay of Ju&s;tice and Expen&s;e of Goodne&s;s to them and us, but to the di|vine Long-&s;uffering?</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="005500_0354_103966619A242380">And after the fatal Shipwreck of our fir&s;t Parents, when in &s;ucceeding Time the <HI>Antidiluvian</HI> World had &s;unk into &s;uch dreadful Degeneracy, that all Fle&s;h had corrupted their Way; and the Almighty was hereby pro|vok'd to threaten a Deludge of Judgment, as exten&s;ive as the moral Contagion that procur'd it: Yet before it was inflicted, the God of Patience allowed them <HI>One Hundred</HI> and <HI>Twenty</HI> Years warning, by <HI>Noah</HI> a preacher of Righteou&s;nes; dur|ing which Space the Long-&s;uffering of God waited on them. (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 20. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 5.) And had not the Church of the Jews great Experience of the Patience of God? Tho' the Power and Love of God were marvelou&s;ly manife&s;ted, in delivering that People from the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive Bondage in <HI>Egypt,</HI> as well as in pre&s;erving of them, and providing for them in their Way to <HI>Canaan.</HI> The whole was effect|ed by the mighty Hand, and out&s;tretched Arm of God, by a Series of mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing Miracles! Yet after all, what In|fidelity, Idolatry, Murmurings and Perver&s;ene&s;s, was that People &s;o highly favoured guilty of, and yet were not de|&s;troy'd? Hence the Almighty is &s;aid to <HI>&s;uffer their Manners in the Wilderne&s;s forty Years, Acts</HI> xiii. 18. And tho' their Idolatries afterwards were &s;candalous to the la&s;t degree, yet Patience was exercis'd, Deliverers many Times rais'd up for them, and Judgments but &s;lowly executed, and attend|ed with a mixture of Mercy: And even after they had bro't their crim&s;on Impieties to the mo&s;t horid Cri&s;is, by crucifi|ing the Son of God! A Prodigy of Wickedne&s;s, which the Sun him&s;elf refus'd to behold! An Impiety at which the con|&s;cious Earth trembled with Horror and Regret! Yet did divine Patience &s;pare them for a con&s;iderable &s;pace of Time, till they had the Offers of Life repeatedly made to them by the primitive Preachers of the Go&s;pel, as well as repeated Warnings of their ju&s;t and approaching Ruin! It was a
<PB N="352" REF="005500_0355_1039665FE3311C08">
matter of Forty Years after, that unhappy and ungrateful Nation, had judged them&s;elves unworthy of eternal Life, by rejecting the Apo&s;tolical Warnings and Invitations before their Metropolis was &s;ack'd, and them&s;elves di&s;pers'd and almo&s;t wholly de&s;troy'd by the Sword of <HI>Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ian.</HI></P>
<P>But the Jewi&s;h Church and Nation, are not the only Sharers, of the rich Expence of divine Patience. The Gentiles al&s;o tho' guilty of the mo&s;t infand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous Iniquities, directly contrary to Natures Light, have had large Experience there|of. And hence God is &s;aid, <HI>in Time pa&s;t to &s;uffer all Nati|ons to walk in their own Ways, and to give them Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Sea&s;ons, filling their Hearts with Food and Gladne&s;s,</HI> Acts xiv. 16, 17. Yea and it is no incon&s;iderable In&s;tance of the Long-&s;uffering of God, that it has been ex|tended to fal&s;e Teachers, who have endeavour'd to &s;educe and corrupt the Church of God. The&s;e likewi&s;e have had a <HI>Space given them to repent, tho' they repented not, Rev.</HI> ii. 21. But to proceed,</P>
<P>Methinks the Methods of the divine Proceedings, even in inflicting of Judgments upon Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, if clo&s;ely attend|ed to, may a&s;&s;i&s;t our Conceptions of the Riches of God's Patience.</P>
<P>Before Judgment is executed, the gracious God doth ge|nerally give by his Servants, plain and frequent Warning. And hence it is &s;aid, <HI>that he hew'd the People of I&s;rael by his Prophets, and &s;lew them by the Words of his Mouth. He &s;peak|eth once, yea twice, but Man perceiveth it not, that he may withdraw Man from his purpo&s;e, and hide Pride from Man.</HI> Job. xxxiii. 14, 17.</P>
<P>And when Sinners &s;light the divine Warnings, ob&s;tinate|ly refu&s;ing to be reclaim'd, and &s;o render the inflicting of Judgment nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate the Honour of God's Go|vernment. Behold the long-&s;uffering God u&s;es a Gradation

herein, by &s;ending a Succe&s;&s;ion of le&s;&s;er Judgments, before more awful Calamities are inflicted.

<P>The Almighty in executing of his Judgments, doth ge|nerally moderate them, &s;o that they are not equal to the Demerit of Sin. Of this the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;peaks excel|lently, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxvii. 7, 8. <HI>Hath he &s;mitten him, as he &s;mote tho&s;e that &s;mote him, or is he &s;lain according to the Slaugh|ter, of them that are &s;lain by him?

<P>And here it &s;hould be with Amazement ob&s;erv'd, that when the Execution of Judgment is rendered nece&s;&s;ary, by the continued Impieties of unrelenting Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, the Almighty doth this &s;trange Work, with a kind of regret and reluctance. <HI>Ho&s;ea.</HI> xi. 8, 9. <HI>How &s;hall I give thee up E|phraim, how &s;hall I deliver thee I&s;rael, How &s;hall I make thee as Admah, how &s;hall I &s;et thee as Zeboim, mine Heart is turned within me, and my Relentings are kindled together?</HI> When our compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer, drew near to, and be|held the City of Jeru&s;alem, having in his view the de&s;olat|ing Calamities which were to en&s;ue, upon their ungrateful Refu&s;al of his gracious and infinitely important Propo&s;als,

<P N="1">1&s;t. One Rea&s;on is, God's <HI>good</HI> and <HI>beneficent Nature,</HI> which is more prone to Mercy than Judgment. The for|mer is his Delight, but the latter is his &s;trange Work.

<P N="2">2dly. Another Rea&s;on of divine Forbearance, is the Ma|nife&s;tation of God's <HI>Glory.</HI> Jehovah is not only induced to Patience, by the Kindne&s;s of his Nature, but likewi&s;e by the
<PB N="355" REF="005500_0358_1039665B08F0AA70">
Glory of his Name. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xlviii. 9, 11. <HI>For my Name &s;ake will I defer mine Anger, and for my Prai&s;e will I refrain from thee, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut thee not off.

For how &s;hould my Name be polluted, and I will not give my Glory to another.</HI> An Example of this we have in <HI>Pharaoh, Ex.</HI> ix. 16. <HI>And in very Deed for this Cau&s;e have I rais'd thee up, for to &s;hew in thee my Power, and that my Name may be declar'd through out all the Earth.</HI> And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Lord exerci&s;es Long-&s;uffering becau&s;e of his Promi&s;e made to pious People, and their Offspring. <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 7. <HI>And I will e&s;tabli&s;h my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee in their Generations, for an ever|la&s;ting Covenant to be a God unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. Another Rea&s;on of God's Patience is, that &s;ome may be hereby induced to repent of their evil Ways. <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 4. <HI>Or de&s;pi&s;e&s;t thou the Riches of his Goodne&s;s, Forbearance and Long-&s;uffering, not knowing that the Goodne&s;s of God leadeth thee to Repentance.</HI> And indeed Men are lo&s;t to all Sen&s;e of Humanity and Gratitude, if the Con&s;ideration of God's Goodne&s;s and Long-&s;uffering, does not excite their Sorrows for their Offences again&s;t him. Memorable are the Words of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> upon this Subject. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 9. <HI>The Lord is not &s;lack concerning his Promi&s;e, as &s;ome Men count Slackne&s;s, but is long-&s;uffering to usward, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to Repentance.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly. The Almighty forbears to execute Vengeance be|cau&s;e of the Mixture of good People with bad in this World, and from the Regard he bears to the Prayers of the Former. <HI>Gen.</HI> xix. 21, 22. <HI>And he &s;aid unto him, &s;ee I have accepted thee concerning this Thing al&s;o, that I will not overthrow this City; for the which thou ha&s;t &s;poken, Ha&s;te thee e&s;cape thi|ther,
<PB N="356" REF="005500_0359_10396659471F3248">
for I cannot do any Thing till thou become thither; there|fore the City was called</HI> Zoar. The Holy Seed, <HI>i. e,</HI> pious People, are the Sub&s;tance, the Support of Places where they are. (<HI>I&s;a.</HI> vi. 13.) And hence it is &s;aid, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xix. <HI>Except the Lord of Ho&s;ts had left unto us a very &s;mall Remnant, we &s;hould have been as</HI> Sodom,&mdash;<HI>and like unto</HI> Gomorah.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. Another Rea&s;on of God's Patience, is to continue, and propagate his Church in the World. <HI>Rev.</HI> vi. 10, 11. <HI>And they cried with a loud Voice &s;aying, how long O Lord Holy and true, do&s;t thou not judge and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth?&mdash;And it was &s;aid unto them, that they &s;hould re&s;t, yet for a little Sea&s;on, until their fellow Ser|vants and Brethren,&mdash;&s;hould be fulfilled,</HI> i. e. until their Number was compleated. The Church could not be con|tinued from Age to Age, if God was &s;peedy in the Execu|tion of his Wrath. Many of the Elect are doubtle&s;s in the Loyns of impious Parents, who are &s;par'd for their Sakes. Again</P>
<P N="7">7thly. Patience is exercis'd, to render Sinners who con|tinue in their Impenitence inexcu&s;able; and to vindicate the Ju&s;tice of God in their final Ruin. (<HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 1, 2, 4.) The long continuance, and rich Expence of divine Patience towards impenitent Sinners, bereave them of all Apology in their own Favour! <HI>This, this</HI> will make them wholly &s;peechle&s;s, before the Judgment Bar of the incarnate God! they will not be able to offer one Plea in their De|fence. The</P>
<P N="4">4th. Propos'd comes now to be &s;poke upon, namely, the con&s;i&s;tency of divine Patience, with God's vindicative Ju&s;tice, and this will appear by con&s;idering the following Parti|culars.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t As there is an equal nece&s;&s;ity of glorifying the Attri|butes of Patience, as of God's other Perfections, &s;o there is no Time for this but in the pre&s;ent World. Neither the
<PB N="357" REF="005500_0360_10396657A31CE440">
Sav'd or Damn'd are Objects of Patience, the former need it not, and the latter are pa&s;t it. Then either it mu&s;t be ma|nife&s;ted here or not at all; but there will be &s;ufficient Room for the Terrible Di&s;plays of Ju&s;tice in another World.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Seeing that the De&s;ign of avenging Ju&s;tice is either to manife&s;t God's Holine&s;s, or to &s;ecure the Rights of his Sovereignty, then if both the&s;e can be an&s;wered, notwith|&s;tanding the Exerci&s;e of Patience, there is &s;urely a Con|&s;i&s;tency and Harmony between them, and that this is the very Ca&s;e appears thus: God's Holine&s;s is manife&s;ted in his Threat|nings again&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, the Execution of which his Truth &s;tands engaged to &s;ecure. The ju&s;t <HI>Jehovah</HI> has &s;aid, That <HI>he will rain upon Sinners Snares, Fire, and Brim&s;trone, and an horrible Tempe&s;t, and this &s;hall be the Portion of their Cup! For the Lord loveth Righteou&s;ne&s;s, P&s;a.</HI> xi. 6, 7. And tho' this be a Time of Probation, yet in order to vindicate God's Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice, there be &s;ome Executions of Wrath. Hence the Lord is &s;aid <HI>to be known by the Judg|ments which he executes, and that the wicked are &s;nared in the Work of their own Hands.</HI></P>
<P>Neither does a temporary Su&s;pen&s;ion of the full Executions of Ju&s;tice, give any Occa&s;ion to Sinners to in&s;ult the di|vine Sovereignty; nay, to ingenious Minds, it is rather an Inducement to &s;ubmit to the divine Government, &s;eeing he is &s;o full of Clemency. Slow Proceedings in Judgment, and Reprieves granted to Malefactors, are no Reproach; but an Honour to civil Governments; and why &s;hould the &s;ame mild Mea&s;ures be reckon'd an Impeachment upon the Di|vine? But I ha&s;ten to the Improvement of this Subject. And 1&s;t. We may learn from it the exceeding Preciou&s;ne&s;s of the Souls of Men. Our Lord, who is the be&s;t Judge of the Worth of Things, e&s;teems one of them worth more <HI>than the whole World, Mat.</HI> xvi. 29. And this he has te&s;tify'd
<PB N="358" REF="005500_0361_10396655F964B020">
by the Price he has laid down for them, which was no le&s;s than his own mo&s;t precious Blood, (1. <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 19.) As well as by the importunate Methods he u&s;es in order to apply this Redemption, and particularly by the Expence of his Patience in waiting to be Gracious to poor Sinners. And why then &s;hould we not value our own Souls, and expre&s;s this by &s;uitable Solicitude, and Labours to &s;ecure their Hap|pine&s;s? And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. From the Patience of God we may learn this Le&s;&s;on, that it is better for us to be at the Mercy of God than of any Creature: Tho' <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was meek above all Men upon the Face of the Earth, yet the Impieties of the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> put him in a Rage again&s;t them, &s;o that he acco&s;ted them in the following Language at <HI>Meriba, You Rebels</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>mu&s;t I draw Water for you out of the Rock?</HI> The Prophet <HI>Jonah</HI> &s;eem'd to be more concern'd about his Credit, than about the Lives of the great City <HI>Nini|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h;</HI> yea he was di&s;pleas'd and very Angry at the Kindne&s;s of God, in &s;paring that &s;inful Place upon their Reforma|tion, and aco&s;ted the Almighty in very undecent Language on this Occa&s;ion: yea he re&s;ented the Kindne&s;s of God to that Place in &s;uch a Degree, that he cho&s;e Death rather than Life on this Account! O &s;trange and unaccountable Conduct! (<HI>See Jona</HI> iv. 1.2.3.) But</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Another U&s;e that may be ju&s;tly drawn from this Subject of divine Patience, is of Encouragement to all Sin&s;ick Souls; &s;uch &s;hould be induc'd hereby to ca&s;t away their de&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nding Fears, and to come to JESUS CHRIST with Hopes of obtaining Mercy. To this he invites them in a compa&s;&s;ionate Manner, <HI>Mat.</HI> xi. 28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy Laden, and I will give you Re&s;t:</HI> And &s;urely our dear Lord will be as Good as his Word. The Enemy of Souls labours to di&s;courage awakned Sinners
<PB N="359" REF="005500_0362_10396653E8C66E48">
in their Motions to CHRIST by many dreadful &s;ugge&s;tions &s;uch as the&s;e following, <HI>viz.</HI> That they have committed the unpardonable Sin; but how can that be while they bewail Sin and &s;eek Deliverance from it? Or by in&s;inuating that the Sea&s;on of Mercy is pa&s;t, and that God is &s;o &s;evere that he will have no Compa&s;&s;ion on them. But the&s;e are fal&s;e Sugge&s;tions, how can the Day of Mercy be pa&s;t when God is enlightning the Mind and humbling the Heart by his gracious Influences? No! It is then a &s;pecial Sea|&s;on of Mercy, the Door of Hope is yet open, and the golden Scepter of Pardon and Peace is held forth by the King of Glory. God is not waiting for an Opportunity to de&s;troy the Sinner, but for an Opportunity to exalt his glorious Grace in &s;hewing them Salvation: Poor Sinners, ye are going to a God of Mercy, Grace and Patience, a God who glories in the Freene&s;s of his Love! Surely if his Patience bore with you in your ob&s;tinate Cour&s;e of unre|lenting Impieties, it will much more &s;o when you are humbled under a Sen&s;e thereof: Therefore be encouraged to attend with Hope upon the Means of Grace, and to venture your guilty Souls by believing on an all-&s;ufficient and compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer, who is able to &s;ave to the ut|termo&s;t all that come to the Father by him, and who has him&s;elf a&s;&s;ur'd us, that &s;uch as come he will by no Means ca&s;t out. But I proceed</P>
<P N="3">3dly. To a U&s;e of Exhortation in the following Particulars And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Dear Brethren, let us admire and adore the Patience of God towards our&s;elves! And to this we may be ju&s;tly excited by con&s;idering the Number, Importance and Long-continuance of the Favours of God towards us, toge|ther with the inumerable and heighnous Iniquities which we have pre&s;umptuou&s;ly and ungratefully committed again&s;t
<PB N="360" REF="005500_0363_10396652664881B0">
all the dear Obligations of divine Love! If God &s;hould mark Iniquities who could &s;tand before him? How ju&s;tly therefore, and how ea&s;ily might the Almighty have made us Mi&s;erable, beyond a Remedy long before now? And yet <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s Patience waits. Sometimes Men defer the Execution of their Anger, becau&s;e they are not able to ef|fect it: This was King <HI>David</HI>'s Ca&s;e in &s;u&s;pending <HI>Joab</HI>'s Puni&s;hment. The Sons of <HI>Zeruiah,</HI> as he him&s;elf acknow|ledged, were too hard for him, they had got &s;o great a Party of the Nation upon their Side, that it was perilous to try to bring them &s;peedily to publick Ju&s;tice: But God is Almighty in Power, and ea&s;ily able at any Time, in an In&s;tant, to &s;ubdue the mo&s;t Proud and Potent of his Enemies. It may ju&s;tly melt our Hearts into Admiration and Gratitude, when we think how ju&s;tly every Soul of us here pre&s;ent might be this Moment enduring the Ven|geance of eternal Fire, pa&s;t all Hopes of ever obtaining Mercy; and that yet notwith&s;tanding of all our crim&s;on Provocations we are on this &s;ide Ruin, and have the Of|fers of Salvation made to us. But in the</P>
<P N="2">2d. Place let us beware that we abu&s;e not the Patience of God by taking Encouragement therefrom to per&s;i&s;t in &s;inning again&s;t him.

The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> long &s;ince prophecy'd of this herd of hardned Mortals. (2 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 4.) But where is the Sen&s;e of this Cavil, for will not Rea&s;on it &s;elf &s;ugge&s;t, that there &s;hould be a Time of Probation before that of Recompence?</P>
<P>But that I may come more clo&s;ely to the Con&s;ciences of my Hearers, may I not &s;afely a&s;&s;ert, that all you that neglect to improve the pre&s;ent Sea&s;on of Mercy, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to embrace the Lord JESUS CHRIST, are abu&s;ers of God's Patience!

<P>THIS P&s;alm was compos'd either when David was in great Di&s;tre&s;s, or &s;ometime afterwards in Re|membrance of it, and of the Kindne&s;s and Truth of God, apparent in delivering him therefrom.

The Remembrance he had of God's <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> to him formerly, in delivering him out of Troubles: <HI>For thou ha&s;t redeemed me.</HI> And 2dly. The Con&s;ideration of the Truth of God's <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Word, O Lord God of Truth,</HI> as if he had &s;aid, thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed O Lord, that thou wilt be pre&s;ent with thy People in Di&s;tre&s;s, and help them; and &s;urely thou wilt be as good as thy Word, for thou art the God of Truth. The Remembrance of pa&s;t Mercies and Deliverances, both Spiritual and Temporal is of great Ne|ce&s;&s;ity in our Chri&s;tian Cour&s;e, both to excite our Gratitude to God, and encourage our Tru&s;t in him. If we do not remember the <HI>Hill-Mizar,</HI> the <HI>Peniels,</HI> the <HI>Pi&s;gas,</HI> the
<PB N="365" REF="005500_0368_10396649DB91B958">
<HI>Bokims</HI> that we have met with, how &s;hall we love our Be|nefactors and hope in him? And without Love and Hope how can we perform the Duties required of us with Dili|gence? Encounter the Dangers we are inviron'd with, without Courage, or &s;u&s;tain the Difficulties we are expo&s;ed to, with Patience? Was not our Lord offended with his Di&s;ciples that they &s;o &s;oon forgot the Miracle about the Loaves? How peircing and upbraiding was the reproof of CHRIST on this Occa&s;ion? <HI>O ye Fools and &s;low of Heart to believe, do ye not remember the Miracle of the Loaves?</HI></P>
<P>The Subject that I purpo&s;e to di&s;cour&s;e upon from the Text, is, <HI>the Truth of God.</HI> This <HI>Attribute</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> is frequently a&s;crib'd to God in Scripture. Hence (1) He is expre&s;ly &s;aid <HI>to be True,</HI> Jer. x. 10. <HI>But the Lord is the True God</HI> (2) It is likewi&s;e &s;aid, <HI>that he cannot lie or repent,</HI> 1 Sam. xv. 29. <HI>And al&s;o the Strength of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e or repent, for he is not a Man that he &s;hould repent.</HI> Parti|cularly (3) In his <HI>Words,</HI> he is True yea Truth it&s;elf. Joh. xvii. 17. <HI>Sanctify them thro' thy Truth, thy Word is Truth.</HI> (4) In his Works, thus <HI>all the Ways of the Lord are</HI> &s;aid to be <HI>Mercy and Truth, unto &s;uch as keep his Covenant.</HI> P&s;al. xxv. 10.</P>
<P>And it mu&s;t needs be that God is True, if we con&s;ider the following Particulars, 1&s;t. If God were not true, there could be nothing True, or no Truth; for how can there be a &s;econd Truth without a fir&s;t? But there is &s;uch a Thing as Truth, therefore God is true. It is equally ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, either that the Creature has any Vertue, which it has not deriv'd from God the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of all Being and Goodne&s;s, or that it &s;hould derive it from one who had it not. 2dly. All fal&s;ehood and deceit &s;prings from &s;ome Im|perfection, either of Ignorance or perver&s;e Intention. Men often mi&s;take thro' Ignorance or Inadvertency; they think
<PB N="366" REF="005500_0369_10396648384B7020">
of Things otherwi&s;e than they are, either thro' want of a competent mea&s;ure of Knowledge or thro' neglect of due Deliberation upon Things, neither of which are compatible to that God who is infinite in Wi&s;dom, and Acts by Council.</P>
<P>Again Men deceive others of Purpo&s;e, thro' an evil Di&s;|po&s;ition of Nature, the Root of which is in all the Po&s;terity of <HI>Adam!</HI> But God is perfectly Pure and Holy, entirely free from every corrupt Bya&s;s. And hence is that antithe&s;is or contrariety between the divine Nature, and the Human in its degenerate and fallen State; which is mentioned Rom. iii. 4. <HI>Yea let God be True, but every Man a Lyar; as it is written, that thou mighte&s;t be ju&s;tify'd in thy &s;ayings, and mighte&s;t overcome when thou judge&s;t.</HI> When therefore God is &s;aid <HI>to deceive the Prophet, Ezek.</HI> xiv. 9. It only &s;ignifies the Almighty's di&s;appointing him by the Cour&s;e of his all-governing Providence, of the fond Expectations he had from &s;econd Cau&s;es, and his &s;uffering the Prophet to impo&s;e upon him&s;elf by wrong Conjectures. Men may be influenced by the vicious Propen&s;ities of their own Natures, or by the In&s;tigations of Satan to deceive. But it is directly contrary to, and incompatible with the infinite untainted and inviolable purity of the divine Nature to be any Ways ac|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;uch abhored Impiety. <HI>It is impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie,</HI> as the Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, (<HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 18.)</P>
<P>Men do not always adhere with con&s;tancy to their Purpo|&s;es and Declarations, either, 1&s;t. Becau&s;e they were ra&s;h|ly and precipitantly made, without a ju&s;t View of Things, and mature Deliberation upon them. Or 2dly. For want of Power to put their De&s;igns into Execution, or 3dly. Becau&s;e of &s;ome unfore&s;een Changes that are brought to pa&s;s by divine Providence, which put their Affairs into a different Situati|on

fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what they were before; and from what they fir&s;t had in View. But neither of the&s;e Imperfections can be a&s;crib'd without Bla&s;phemy to God. As his Wi&s;dom is un|&s;earchable, &s;o his Power is Infinite, and his Happine&s;s in|variable and eternal. All Futurity is open to his all pene|trating Eye, and all Things po&s;&s;ible are included within the Compa&s;s of his Almightine&s;s. <HI>He is of one Mind and who can turn him, and what his Soul de&s;ireth even that he doeth.</HI> Job xxiii. 13. No change of Affairs can be produc'd be&s;ides his Purpo&s;e or without the Interpo&s;ition of his &s;overeign Providence, and therefore he cannot be thereby nece&s;&s;itated to change his Purpo&s;e, or fall from his Declarations. And hence <HI>Philo</HI> well ob&s;erves, <Q>That all the Words of God are Oaths.</Q> i. e. mo&s;t &s;acred and certain. And <HI>Fulgentius</HI> &s;ayeth truly concerning the &s;upream Being, viz. <Q>That he is Truth without Fallacy, Goodne&s;s without Malice, and Happine&s;s without Mi&s;ery.</Q> <HI>Pythagoras</HI> being ask'd what made Men like to God, an&s;wered, <HI>cum vera loquntur</HI> i. e. when they &s;peak Things that are true.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It may be ob&s;erved, that Truth in its general Na|ture, con&s;i&s;ts in Agreement, and is Three-fold, <HI>viz.</HI> Phy&s;i|cal, Logical, and Moral. <HI>Phy&s;ical Truth,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the A|greement, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the Appearence of a Thing, and the Thing it&s;elf. This kind of Truth is by &s;ome term'd e&s;&s;ential, and by others metaphy&s;ical.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Logical Truth</HI> is when we conceive of a Thing in our Minds, as it really is in it &s;elf. As the Former is oppos'd to Paint, and all fal&s;e Appearences, &s;o this is oppos'd to Error and Mi&s;take in Judgement.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="368" REF="005500_0371_10396644F64F2ED8">3dly. <HI>Moral Truth</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in &s;peaking as we think, this is oppos'd to lying, the Nature of which con&s;i&s;ts in going again&s;t the Mind, according to the old and true Saying, <HI>mentire e&s;t contra mentem ire.</HI></P>
<P>Now each of the&s;e Kinds of Truth, that I have mentioned belongs to God truly and tran&s;cendently: For</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. He has what appertains to true Godhead by his E&s;|&s;ence without any Di&s;gui&s;e. <HI>John</HI> xvii. 3. <HI>This is eternal Life, to know thee the only tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God, and JESUS CHRIST whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI> Jehovah hath a real Sub&s;i&s;tence, and gives Being to all Creatures; whereas the fal&s;e Gods of the Heathen, have nothing divine, they only carry a deceitful Appearance, or obtain it in the Minds of their Wor&s;hippers. <HI>They are only dumb Idols which have Eyes and &s;ee not, Ears and hear not, neither &s;peak they thro' their Threats! They are nothing but Vanity and a Lie, They that make them are like to them, and &s;o is every one that tru&s;teth in them</HI> P&s;al. cxv. 5, 8. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Mind of God exactly agrees with the Nature of Things, becau&s;e he beholds all Things in him&s;elf. <HI>Nei|ther is there any Creature that is not manife&s;t in his Sight, but all Things are naked and open unto the Eye of him, with whom we have to do.</HI> Heb. iv. 13.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Declarations of God's Word exactly agree with the Conceptions of his Mind, and Re&s;olutions of his Will, in all the Parts thereof whether Hi&s;torical, Prophetical, Promi&s;ory, Minatory, Perceptive. Hence the Word of God is &s;aid <HI>to be pure, P&s;.</HI> cxix. 140. i. e. Its free from all Mix|ture of Deceit and Fal&s;hood. And hence it is likewi&s;e &s;aid to be <HI>try'd,</HI> 2 Sam. xxii. 31. <HI>As for God his Way is perfect the Word of the Lord is try'd, he is a Buckler to all that tru&s;t in him.</HI> P&s;al xii. 6. <HI>The Words of the Lord are pure Words, as Silver try'd in a Furnace of Earth, purified &s;even-times.</HI> And</P>
<P N="4">4thly. All the Works of God exactly agree with his Purpo&s;e
<PB N="369" REF="005500_0372_103966435175BDE8">
and Declaration, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxxii. 4. <HI>He is a Rock his Work is perfect for all his Ways are Judgment, a God of Truth and without Iniquity ju&s;t and right is he.</HI> And hence the Almighty is &s;aid to be <HI>faithful,</HI> 1&s;t. In the Works of <HI>Creation,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iv. 19. <HI>Wherefore let them that &s;uffer according to the Will of God commit the keeping of their Souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</HI> 2dly. In the Work of <HI>Redemption,</HI> Heb. ii. 17. <HI>Wherefore in all Things it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a mer|ciful and faithful high Prie&s;t.</HI> 3dly. The Almighty is faith|ful in the Works <HI>of Grace,</HI> and hence <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> are &s;aid to come <HI>by JESUS CHRIST,</HI> John i. 17. 4thly. He is likewi&s;e faithful in the Works of <HI>Providence,</HI> more e&s;pe|cially in the Pre&s;ervation of his Church, <HI>Rev.</HI> xix. 11. <HI>And I &s;aw Heaven opened, and behold a white Hor&s;e, and he that &s;at on him was called faithful and true, and in Righteou&s;ne&s;s he doth judge and make War.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Univer&s;al Truth of God, that has been menti|oned, entirely excludes, and is directly oppos'd to every Error in Judgment, as well as to all Fal&s;hood, and lying in Speech and to all Hypocri&s;y and Deceit in Practice. And therefore <HI>Solomon</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <HI>Prov.</HI> vi. 16, 17, 19. <HI>That &s;ix Things the Lord Hates, yea that &s;even are an Abomination unto him!</HI> Among which he names <HI>a lying Tongue, and a fal&s;e Witne&s;s.</HI> Tit. i. 2 <HI>In hope of eternal Life which God that cannot lie promi&s;ed before the World began.</HI></P>
<P>But in order to open the Nature of divine Truth more fully, I think it may be thus de&s;cribed, viz. <HI>That it is that Property of the divine nature whereby the Almighty con&s;tant|ly and inviolably adheres to his eternal Purpo&s;e both in his Word and Works.</HI> When God is in Scripture call'd <HI>the true God, or the only true God;</HI> the&s;e Phra&s;es do not &s;ignify any di&s;tinct Perfection of the divine Nature, but the whole God-head, in Oppo&s;ition to all that are call'd God's, but are not

&s;o by nature. But when he is call'd <HI>the God of Truth,</HI> as in our Text, it intends a particular Attribute or Perfection of Jehovah, even &s;uch as has but now been de&s;crib'd. Which De&s;cription that it may be the better under&s;tood, let the following particulars be con&s;idered viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That God hath from everla&s;ting purpo&s;ed or deter|mined to permit or effect what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s in Time. i. e. He has before all Time decred, to permit the Evil that is done in Time, without which it could not come to pa&s;s, except we deny the Omnipotence of God, which is bla&s;phemous. And he has likewi&s;e purpos'd to effect the Good, which cannot be brought to pa&s;s without his A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and Influence. And hence we are told <HI>Acts</HI> xv. 18. <HI>That known unto God are all his Works from the Beginning of the World.</HI> This Fore-knowledge nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es his Pur|po&s;e, for what is not certainly determin'd, cannot be certainly foreknown. But the Purpo&s;e of God, which is no other than an imanent or eternal Act of his Will, re&s;pecting his Works of Efficiency, is more expre&s;&s;ly &s;poken of, <HI>Ephe&s;,</HI> i. 11. <HI>In whom al&s;o we have obtained an Inheritance being Prede&s;ti|nated according to the Purpo&s;e of him who works all Things after the Council of his own Will.</HI> And as the Purpo&s;e of God is eternal, in re&s;pect of its Ri&s;e and Orignal, &s;o it is ab&s;olute and invariable in its Nature. The Conditi|ons of Things in the decree, are only therein con&s;ider'd as Means determined to compa&s;s the End de&s;ign'd, <HI>Prov.</HI> xix. 21. <HI>There are many Devices in Man's Heart, neverthele&s;s the Council of the Lord that &s;hall &s;tand.</HI> Job xxiii. 13. <HI>But he is in one Mind, and who can turn him, and what his Soul de&s;ireth even that he doeth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. God hath been pleas'd to reveal &s;ome Part of his eternal Purpo&s;e in his Word. I &s;ay &s;ome Part, becau&s;e there are &s;ecret Things which are known only to God.
<PB N="371" REF="005500_0374_1039663FA5D1DE98">
The Almighty has reveal'd as much of his Purpo&s;e in his Word, as his Wi&s;dom judged nece&s;&s;ary for us to know.</P>
<P>Now the Revelation we have of God's Purpo&s;e in his Word, appears e&s;pecially in the&s;e Things following, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. In the Hy&s;torical Part of it, that contains a true and ju&s;t Relation of Matters of Fact, which have been brought to pa&s;s exactly agreeable to the eternal Plan of the divine Purpo&s;e. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. In Prophe&s;ies of Things to come, many &s;uch are contain'd in Scripture, both of a publick and per&s;onal Na|ture. And how gloriou&s;ly does the Truth of God &s;hine forth in the punctual accompli&s;hment of many of them? Here I &s;hall only mention a few, in Relation to our Lord CHRIST. <HI>Jacob</HI> prophe&s;ied of the Time of his Birth, viz. <HI>That it &s;hould be after the Scepter was departed from Judah.</HI> Gen. xliv. 10. And thus it happened, for <HI>Herod</HI> who &s;way'd the Scepter at that Time, was of an <HI>Idumean</HI> Extraction. The Prophet <HI>Micah.</HI> foretold, that the Place of his Birth &s;hould be <HI>Bethlehem. Mica</HI> v. 2. <HI>But thou Bethlehem Ephra|ta, out of thee &s;hall come forth,&mdash;that is to be the Ruler in I&s;|rael, who&s;e Goings forth have been from of old, from Everla&s;t|ing.</HI> And thus it came to pa&s;s. <HI>Mat.</HI> ii. 1. <HI>Now when JE|SUS was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the Days of</HI> Herod <HI>the King. I&s;aiah</HI> prophe&s;ied that his Parent &s;hould be a Virgin, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> vii. 14. <HI>Behold a Virgin &s;hall conceive and bear a Son, and &s;hall call his Name Imanuel.</HI> And this the Event an&s;wered. (<HI>Mat.</HI> i.) <HI>Zachariah</HI> prophe&s;ied of the humble Circum&s;tances of his Life, in the ixth Chapt. of his Book, and the 9th Ver&s;e. <HI>Rejoyce greatly O Daughter of Zion, &s;hout O Daughter of Jeru&s;alem, behold thy King cometh unto thee, He is is ju&s;t and having Salvation, lowly, and riding upon an A&s;s, and upon a Colt the Foal of an A&s;s!</HI> And do not the Evangeli&s;ts a&s;&s;ure us, that this was fulfilled to a Tittle? <HI>I&s;ai|ah</HI>

And does not the P&s;almi&s;t prophecy of his Re&s;urrection, of which <HI>Jonah</HI> was a Type? <HI>P&s;.</HI> lxviii. 18. <HI>Thou ha&s;t a&s;cended on high, thou ha&s;t led Captivity Captive, thou ha&s;t received Gifts for Men.</HI> Of the accompli&s;hment of which, the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Luke</HI> informs us, (<HI>Luke.</HI> xxiv. 51.) But I proceed</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Almighty reveals his eternal Purpo&s;es in his Word, by Precepts; by the&s;e God &s;hews to Man his Duty and the Way to obtain the divine Favour, in which his Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts; and this the Almighty purpo&s;ed to do from Eternity. And hence it is called the <HI>Council of God. Acts</HI> xx. 27.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The Almighty likewi&s;e reveals his Purpo&s;e in his Word by Threatnings again&s;t his Enemies. The&s;e are as fiery Barriers about his Law, to pre&s;erve it from Contempt
<PB N="173" REF="005500_0376_1039663C99974CD0">
and In&s;ult! As his un&s;potted Holine&s;s is delineated in the Precepts of his Law, &s;o his dreadful Ju&s;tice is di&s;play'd in the Penalties annexed to the Breach thereof, which render Jehovah mo&s;t ju&s;tly an Object of Fear, as the Former of Love. Now the Threatnings of God's Word, are no other than a Revelation of tho&s;e Judgments, which God had de|termin'd from everla&s;ting to inflict, upon finally impenitent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxx. ult. <HI>For Tophet is ordain'd of old; for the King it is prepar'd, he hath made it deep and large, the Pile thereof is Fire and much Wood. The Breath of the Lord like a Stream of Brim&s;tone doth kindle it.</HI> And</P>
<P N="5">5thly. God reveals his eternal Purpo&s;e in his Word, by Promi&s;es of Spiritual and Temporal good Things to his Peo|ple; which he &s;incerely makes, and punctually performs; and on this Account, he is more e&s;pecially call'd, <HI>the faith|ful God, who keepeth Covenant and Mercy with tho&s;e that love him and keep his Commandments, to a Thou&s;and Generations.</HI> Deut. vii. 9. As the Threatnings of God excite Fear, &s;o his Promi&s;es encourage Tru&s;t and Hope. Tho' God is a|ble to make us happy, yet we have no Ground to expect his Goodne&s;s except it be engag'd to us by Promi&s;e: For the Almighty is under no natural Obligation, to magnify his Mercy upon us. But when he is pleas'd to engage his Truth in our Favour by promi&s;e, it renders the Ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed mo&s;t certain; and &s;o mini&s;ters &s;trong Con&s;olation to all that fear God, &s;o that they may rea&s;onably rejoyce in Hope of eternal Life, whatever Difficulties, and threatning Appearances &s;eem to ob&s;truct their attainment of it. Now the Promi&s;es of God either re&s;pect Mankind in general, or the Church in particular, or truly pious Per&s;ons in &s;pecial. Some Benefits promis'd to Mankind in general are the&s;e, viz. That the World &s;hall be pre&s;erved to the &s;econd coming of our Lord, from another Deluge by Water, the Sign of which
<PB N="374" REF="005500_0377_1039663A3AFEA940">
is God's Bow in the Clouds.

The Promi&s;es made to the Church, re&s;pect its Protection, Increa&s;e, and the di|vine Pre&s;ence, in their Religious A&s;&s;emblies. Thus the Almighty hath &s;aid, <HI>that no Weapon form'd again&s;t Zion &s;hall pro&s;per, and that the Gates of Hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t her.</HI> He hath al&s;o promi&s;ed, <HI>that to Shiloh or the Me&s;ias &s;hould be the gathering of the People.</HI> i. e. the Gentiles. <HI>Gen.</HI> xlix. 10.

<P N="1">1&s;t. It is objected that CHRIST is &s;aid <HI>to die for the whole World. (Joh.</HI> i. 29.) How doth this con&s;i&s;t with the Truth of God, &s;eeing that el&s;ewhere, (<HI>viz. Rom.</HI> ix. 22.) It is &s;aid that <HI>&s;ome are Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The Word <HI>World,</HI> is taken either in a limited Sen&s;e, for the World of the Elect. Thus CHRIST is &s;aid <HI>to take away the Sin of the World,</HI> John i. 29.

And thus 2dly. it may be ob&s;erv'd, that CHRIST dyed &s;ufficiently for all, but not intentionally and effectually, <HI>i. e.</HI> The Value of Chri&s;ts Blood was enough for all, but its Vertue was only de&s;ign'd for, and is only apply'd to tho&s;e that believe.

<P N="2">2d. Object. is, that tho' God threatned our fir&s;t Parents that in the Day they eat of the forbidden Fruit they &s;hould &s;urely dye; yet this threatning was not executed, for <HI>Adam</HI> lived after this nine Hundred and thirty Years.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> They did die the &s;ame Day in &s;everal Re&s;pects, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. <HI>Legally,</HI> they were dead in Law, they were con|demn'd by the Law they broke, to a temporal and eternal Death: And this in a foren&s;ick Sen&s;e is often call'd <HI>Death (See Rom.</HI> viii. 10.) <HI>The Body is dead becau&s;e of Sin, i. e.</HI> It is expos'd to Death, as a Con&s;equence of Sin, by Rea&s;on of the Sentence of the Law again&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or not that it is actually dead.

they were under a Nece&s;&s;ity of enduring, in after Times, the Separation of the Soul from the Body, by Vertue of the Sentence of the Law before mentioned, but al&s;o becau&s;e, in all probability, the original cra&s;is and ju&s;t temperature of Hu|mours in their Bodies being broke, there was a direct tendency in this judicial Di&s;order of their very Frame, to a Di&s;&s;olution. A</P>
<P N="3">3d. Object. is, That tho' <HI>Niniveh</HI> was threatned to be de&s;troy'd in forty Days; yet the Threatning was not executed till forty Years after.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Po&s;&s;ibly forty prophetical Days, which are Years, were intended, tho' <HI>Jonah</HI> under&s;tood it not, and if &s;o the Prophe&s;y was exactly fulfill'd: But in my Opinion the following An&s;wer is more &s;atisfactory, <HI>viz.</HI> That there was a Condition imply'd in, and annex'd to the Threat|ning which was intended to be publi&s;hed to the <HI>Ninivites;</HI> namely, that they &s;hould be de&s;troy'd in forty Days, if they did not repent. It appears by the <HI>Ninivites</HI> humbling them&s;elves that they under&s;tood the Prophet in this Sen&s;e. For if the Threatning had been ab&s;olute, the U&s;e of Means would have been to no purpo&s;e, either by the People or the Prophet: But we &s;ee that both did u&s;e Means, he preach'd, and they humbled them&s;elves, and therefore there was certainly a Condition annex'd to the Threatning: And thus the Objection evani&s;hes.</P>
<P>Object. 4. The <HI>Pelagians, Papi&s;ts, Socinians, Arminians, Remon&s;trants</HI> and <HI>Lutherans</HI> &s;ay, that the Doctrine of the <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> re&s;pecting the Decrees, argues God to be Un|true and In&s;incere; becau&s;e while they Teach, that God wills the Salvation of all, that yet notwith&s;tanding, he in in the mean Time wills and decrees the Damnation of &s;ome: And that tho' God offers the Redeemer to every one, and invites them by many Arguments to accept him; yet that he in the mean Time does not will that they &s;hould be|lieve, and repent, and be &s;av'd.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="005500_0381_10396633AEBC5EE8"><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI>'s on the Contrary do &s;olemnly Pro|te&s;t in the Pre&s;ence of God, that they believe God to be True in every Thing, and that his Words do an&s;wer ex|actly to, or agree with both the Things &s;poken of, and his own Mind, and therefore that God always wills what he &s;ays he wills; but after that Manner that he wills, <HI>i. e.</HI> If he declares that he wills an <HI>Event,</HI> then that Event mo&s;t certainly comes to Pa&s;s. If he declares that he wills that this or that &s;hould be our <HI>Duty, i. e.</HI> That we &s;hould do or omit this or that, then it certainly is our <HI>Duty,</HI> whether it be perform'd or not: To this Purpo&s;e they di&s;tingui&s;h the Will of God into <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI> and <HI>Decretive;</HI> the former they &s;ay is that whereby he determines and wills only concerning Right and Rule, <HI>viz.</HI> What we ought to do or omit; but determines nothing concerning the Event: The latter is that whereby God wills and determines concerning the Event which &s;hall be; but does not at all con|cern Right and Rule re&s;pecting what &s;hould be.

Now from what has been &s;aid the following <HI>An&s;wer</HI> may be given to the Objection. <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. That God does not will the Death of a Sinner by a legi&s;lative Will, in as much as he really wills that there &s;hould be a Connection between the Conver&s;ion of the Sinner and his Salvation, and therefore he &s;incere|ly invites every one to Conver&s;ion: And to &s;uch as are con|verted he promi&s;es Life; tho he does not in the mean Time

will decretively to give to all Grace and Salvation. 2dly. The <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> acknowledge that God wills all to be &s;av'd in the Sen&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tin;</HI> who by the Word <HI>All,</HI> under|&s;tood &s;ome of all Sorts, not every Individual: As in the Ark God is &s;aid <HI>to &s;ave all the living Creatures;</HI> but every Bird and Bea&s;t was not &s;av'd, for many peri&s;h'd in the Waters: But <HI>All,</HI> that is, &s;ome of every Kind, were &s;av'd; &s;o God will have all to be &s;av'd, that is &s;ome of all Nations. The Almighty wills Faith and Repentance to be the Duty of All and Singular, but he does not will decretively the Salvation of All and Singular, for then they would be &s;av'd: But the Scriptures a&s;&s;ure us, that but a few are &s;av'd. Salvation is offer'd according to the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> Sy&s;tem, only to tho&s;e that believe and repent, and to them it is given; and where then is the In&s;incerity? If they reply and &s;ay, that &s;uch are invited to come to CHRIST, according to our Doctrine, who are decreed to De&s;truction?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> What then? &s;eeing the Decree does not force or influence the Will. Are not &s;uch invited to come to CHRIST according to their Scheme, whom God foreknows &s;hall Peri&s;h? Does not certain Fore-knowledge fix the Event as much as the Decree? Let them remove this Difficulty which cro&s;&s;es their own Scheme, and they will an&s;wer their own Objection.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The Lord may &s;ometimes delay the Performance of a Promi&s;e, but he will not deny. God's Promi&s;e may lye a long Time, as Seed under Ground, but at la&s;t it will &s;pring up.

Egyptian Bondage, but this Promi&s;e was Four Hundred Years in Travail, before it brought forth the determin'd Event. God promi&s;ed to <HI>Abraham</HI> a numerous Offspring, but Twenty Years elap&s;ed before he had a Son, and then was commanded to &s;lay him. How dark and dreadful was this Providence! But notwith&s;tanding of the Delays and contrary Appearances, the Promi&s;e was accompli&s;h'd in its appointed Sea&s;on!</P>
<P N="2">2dly.

<P N="3">3dly. There are no Promi&s;es of God, but what are made good in Kind in &s;ome In&s;tances. And this is a manife&s;t Vindication of the divine Truth therein engag'd, &s;eeing the Benefits promi&s;ed are conferred on &s;ome. And</P>

That if God thinks it nece&s;&s;ary for his Glory and their Good, he will compa&s;s their Salvation another Way. The Almighty by &s;piritual De&s;ertions and Temptations, doth try the Faith and Patience of his People, as well as humble them, and make them prize CHRIST and his Comforts the more afterwards. And thus the&s;e Things, yea and their very Blunders are (contrary to their natural Tendency) over rul'd for their Good; which is more than an equivalent for the Lo&s;s of di|vine Joy and Comfort for a Time. And therefore there is hereby no Occa&s;ion given to reflect upon the Truth and Faithfulne&s;s of God. But</P>

<P>THIS Book of <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> contains a Repetition of much of the Hi&s;tory and Laws which were men|tioned in the three preceeding Books, and therefore the <HI>Greek</HI> Interpreters, have ju&s;tly given it the Name <HI>Deuteronomy;</HI> which &s;ignifies the &s;econd Law, or the &s;econd Edition of the Law.

The Men of that Generation, to whom the Law was fir&s;t given, were all Dead, and a new Generation being &s;prung up in their Place, it was nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be repeated to them by <HI>Mo|&s;es,</HI> and e&s;pecially a little before his Departure from them, that it might make the deeper Impre&s;&s;ion on them, and as they were ju&s;t going to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the promis'd <HI>Canaan,</HI> it was but nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be told upon what Terms they might expect to hold and enjoy that Land.

to after Death, viz. As the Reward of Vertue, or in Com|memoration of the Good, that they had done to the World in their Life, either by the Invention of profitable Arts, Succe&s;&s;es in Wars, or &s;ome other kind of Service to their Country. It is true, among the Romans, &s;ome had the Ho|nour of an <HI>Apotheo&s;is</HI> or being reckon'd among the Num|ber of the Gods, at the Reque&s;t of their &s;urviving Friends.

<P>He a&s;&s;erts, <Q>That there is a God, who is the fir&s;t Cau&s;e or Beginning of all Things, and that he was from Eternity, or in the Beginning, and that Time took its Ri&s;e from him, and that he is the Fountain of Life, and the be&s;t of Beings. That he is Self-&s;ufficient, the chief Good, and &s;tands in no need of, or can receive any Ad|vantage from any, and that by him all Things con&s;i&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Several of the Gentile Philo&s;ophers di&s;cover their Belief of the divine Unity, by a&s;&s;erting, <Q>That there was one &s;upream God, &s;uperior to all others, whom they call the Father of the God's and of Men. Him they call the Beginning, the End, and Author of all Things, who was before, and is above all Things.</Q> <HI>Morneus,</HI> brings Quota|tions of this Kind, from the Writings of <HI>Plotinus, Proclus, Phorphery, Plutarch</HI> and others; from all which it appears that the wi&s;er Sort among the Pagans, acknowledged the Unity of the &s;upream Being. And therefore that what they &s;poke or did in Oppo&s;ition hereto, was only from a &s;ordid com|pliance
<PB N="391" REF="005500_0394_1039661D13B4B168">
with the prevailing Cu&s;tom of their re&s;pective Countries, to prevent A&s;per&s;ions on their Characters, or Danger to their Per&s;ons. It is probable that they paid only an inferior Kind of religious Wor&s;hip to their Gods, like to what the Papi&s;ts give to their Saints. It is true, herein they were Idolaters; but this they were induced to, in order to e|&s;cape popular Odium. I am not here labouring to extenuate the Pagan Idolatrys; but only to prove that a Number of the more Judicious of them, were led by the Light of natural Rea&s;on to acknowledge the Unity of God.</P>
<P>Now that natural Rea&s;on demon&s;trates this fundamental Article of Religion, namely, the divine <HI>Unity,</HI> will more fully appear, by the following Con&s;iderations, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Rea&s;on teaches us, that in the Subordination of Things, which we behold in the World, we mu&s;t proceed to &s;ome fir&s;t Cau&s;e, which is of it &s;elf, and ab&s;olutely the fir&s;t, before which Nothing could exi&s;t, and with which Nothing could exi&s;t of the &s;ame Nature: For then it would not be fir&s;t. All Number begins in a Uni|ty, and to &s;ay there are two fir&s;t Beings, is a Contradiction in the very Nature of Things. The Multitude of &s;econd Beings proves that that there is a fir&s;t Being, otherwi&s;e they could not exi&s;t: For they can't give Being to them&s;elves: Where there is no fir&s;t, there is no Order, and where there is no Order, there is no Goodne&s;s, except Confu&s;ion be &s;o called, which is ab&s;ur'd; and where there is no Goodne&s;s, there is nothing: For <HI>Being</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> are convertible Terms. Now that Being which is fir&s;t is chief in re&s;pect of Dignity, and therefore he only is God, for Equality and Priority, are incon&s;i&s;tent to the &s;ame Subject. The very Idea of a God, implies a Supremacy in all po&s;&s;ible Ex|cellency.</P>
<P>That there is but one Being, who is without Beginning, and gave Being to all others, appears thus. If there were
<PB N="392" REF="005500_0395_1039661B917B9600">
more Gods, they mu&s;t derive their Being from him, and then they are a Part of his Creation, and con&s;equently not Gods: For God and the Creature are infinitely oppos'd to each other. Well then &s;eeing there is but one Self-exi&s;ting independent Being, there can be but one God.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Rea&s;on proclaims that God is infinite in all Per|fections and that becau&s;e he is not limitted by a prior Cau&s;e, he mu&s;t therefore po&s;&s;es all Being and Goodne&s;s, either formally or eminently. Now the very Idea of God's In|finity not only &s;peaks his own Perfection to be boundle&s;s, but likewi&s;e that he bounds and limits the Perfections of all others. And thus being limitted they cannot be infinite and &s;o the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors thereof cannot be God.</P>
<P>And as infinite Perfection implies in it all Perfection, &s;o it cannot be divided among many, for then the Parts would be le&s;s than the whole, and &s;o not infinite: Upon this Sup|po&s;ition there would be no God at all, becau&s;e infinite Excellency is nece&s;&s;arily implied in the Idea of a God.</P>
<P>There is but one infinite Being and therefore but one God. <HI>Jer.</HI> xxiii. 24. <HI>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth &s;ayeth the Lord.</HI> If there be one infinite Being filling all Places at once, how can there be any Room for another Infinite to &s;ub&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Rea&s;on demon&s;trates, that the fir&s;t Being is. Al|mighty in Power, and therefore there is no other God, that can hinder or with&s;tand his Operations. If they can, then he is not Omnipotent, and &s;o not God? If they cannot then they are not Omnipotent and &s;o not God? If there were two Omnipotents, then we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that there would be a conte&s;t between them, that which one would do, the other Power being equal, would oppo&s;e, and &s;o all Things would be brought into Confu&s;ion. But that con&s;tant and uniform Order which we behold in the Go|vernment of the World, is a &s;ufficient Confutation of this,
<PB N="393" REF="005500_0396_10396619AEAE5140">
and Proof of the contrary, viz. That there is but one God. If there were more God's than one, all of them mu&s;t be &s;aid to be able to do all Things, and then the &s;ame indivi|dual Power which is exerted by one mu&s;t be exerted by all, which is ab&s;urd and in the Nature of Things im|po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Rea&s;on likewi&s;e teaches, that if there be more Gods than one, then either they mu&s;t be all equal to one another or unequal, if equal then none of them can be the chief Good, becau&s;e another is as good as he, and &s;o none of them can be God; becau&s;e to be the chief Good is an e&s;&s;ential Attri|bute of God, which is by this &s;uppos'd equality de&s;troy'd. If they are unequal then the Inferior cannot be God, be|cau&s;e he is imperfect and dependant. Supremacy is doubt|le&s;s an unalianable Prerogative of God, he is over all God ble&s;&s;ed forever.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Ab&s;olute Sovereignty, and univer&s;al Dominion are e&s;&s;ential to a God, he being the Author and Original of all other Beings, has by con&s;equence a Right to give Laws to all, but is &s;ubject to no controle him&s;elf, becau&s;e he is Self-exi&s;tent and independent. Now if there were more God's than one, then every one could not have ab&s;olute Sovereignty and univer&s;al Dominion: They might com|mand and forbid oppo&s;ite Things, and &s;o controle the Pow|er of each other. The &s;ame Thing might therefore become both Sin and Duty, in re&s;pect of the Subjects, becau&s;e com|manded by one and forbid by the other, and thus there could be no certain Rule of Right, every Thing would be confus'd.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. We may farther ob&s;erve, that all the divine At|tributes prove God to be one. If none be God but he that hath all tho&s;e Attributes which Scripture and Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign to God, then there can be but one. Altho' there be &s;ome
<PB N="394" REF="005500_0397_103966180D2AD1B0">
faint Emblem of &s;ome of God's Attributes in Creatures, as particularly of his Holine&s;s and Goodne&s;s, &amp;c. yet Crea|tures have them not ab&s;olutely or in the highe&s;t Degree, they may be Good, Holy, but cannot be Holine&s;s and Goodne&s;s; and thus the Attributes which are call'd communicable, can in their own Nature, properly and ab&s;olutely, belong but to one. And as to God's incommunicable Attributes, &s;uch as his immen&s;ity, &amp;c. it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be mul|tiply'd, if there be two Immen&s;ity's, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily confine each other, and &s;o neither be immen&s;e. Once more</P>
<P N="7">7thly. Seeing that God is the Creator of all, it is but ju&s;t and right that he &s;hould be the End of all, of him and thro' him, and therefore to him are all Things. As the fir&s;t Being mu&s;t needs be the Be&s;t, and in this Sen&s;e de|&s;erves to be the la&s;t End of all, &s;o he has a ju&s;t Claim of Right to it, having produced all by his Power, and pre|&s;erved and &s;upported all by his Goodne&s;s; and therefore the Creature is under a natural and indi&s;pen&s;able Obligation to pay this Debt of Homage to his Creator, Pre&s;erver and Benefactor, namely, to love him with &s;upream Re&s;pect and to make his Glory his la&s;t End in all his Actions, whe|ther Natural, Civil or Religious, all which is utterly incon|&s;i&s;tent with a multiplicity of Gods: For we can give our highe&s;t Love but to one, and make his Honour our highe&s;t Mark, which is the Natural Re&s;ult of the Former.</P>
<P>In the mean Time it ought to be maintain'd, that the&s;e Things following do not oppo&s;e the Unity of God, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. A plurality of <HI>Names,</HI> &s;eeing they &s;ignify no more but one God. Nor</P>
<P N="2">2dly. A plurality of <HI>Attributes,</HI> &s;eeing they do but repre|&s;ent the infinite Perfection of the divine Nature, which is but one in it &s;elf, in a Way accommodated to our weak and inadequate Conceptions, Nor</P>

<P N="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to explain the <HI>Nature of the di|vine Onene&s;s.</HI> And here it may be ob&s;erv'd that the Al|mighty is one.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Not by a <HI>Unity</HI> of <HI>Subject</HI> and <HI>Accident,</HI> namely &s;uch as belongs to all created Spirits, Angels and the Souls of Men. Nor</P>

<P N="3">3dly. By a <HI>Unity</HI> of <HI>Species,</HI> which admits more Indi|viduals of the &s;ame Name and Nature.</P>
<P>But po&s;&s;itively God is one by a <HI>&s;ingular Unity</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> which excludes all <HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> of every Kind: He is &s;o one as to be undivided in him&s;elf, and indivi&s;ible into more of the &s;ame Name and Nature, and therefore the Unity of God is not an <HI>Arithmetical Unity</HI> which is the Beginning of Num|ber, but it is an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> and <HI>tran&s;cendent Unity,</HI> whereby God is one in his Nature: And hence <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> &s;ayeth truly, <Q>Non unum inquit Deum numero &s;ed Natura confitemur. i. e.

But the &s;upream Being hath no Parts, and his Perfections are not &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd as the qualities of Creatures; for if &s;o, there would be as many di&s;tinct infinite Beings in God, as there are Attributes. Nor</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Are any of the divine Perfections accidental to him. No, they are all his very Being. That is &s;aid to be acciden|tal, which a Sub&s;tance can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without. But to &s;uppo&s;e the Almighty bereav'd of any one of his Attributes, is to &s;uppo&s;e him Imperfect, and &s;o no God. Therefore</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The divine Perfections are repre&s;ented as many and di&s;tinct, becau&s;e of the different Objects which the divine Perfection fixes upon, and the different <HI>Effects</HI> it produces in Creatures, as well as in conde&s;cention to their weak and finite Minds, which can conceive of the divine Nature, but as it were by Parts. But notwith&s;tanding, it is evident from both Scripture and Rea&s;on, that the divine Nature is Simple and Uncompounded, and that whatever is in God is God. We &s;hould therefore be careful that while we compare the divine Perfections with the faint Emblems thereof that be in Creatures, to a&s;&s;i&s;t our Conceptions of them, that we do
<PB N="397" REF="005500_0400_1039673875AFE580">
in the mean Time &s;eparate from them every Thing that argues imperfection.</P>
<P>The Improvement of this Subject remains. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Unity</HI> of the &s;upream Be|ing may ju&s;tly excite in us an Abhorrence of all Idolatry, whether of a more cra&s;s or &s;ubtile Kind; for by both the divine Unity is deny'd. The Polythei&s;m of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> is but a &s;pecious Sort of Athei&s;m; they that Wor&s;hip more than one God, do in Effect wor&s;hip no God at all; becau&s;e they give him not that &s;upream undivided Re&s;pect which is his due. 2 King xvii. 33.34. <HI>They feared the Lord, and &s;erved their own God's, after the Manner of their Nations.&mdash;They fear not the Lord.</HI> How dete&s;table there|fore is the Idolatry of the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> who reverence with a Religious Wor&s;hip, Saints and Angels, yea Images and Relicts? What Rea&s;on have we to ble&s;s God while we live, that we are deliver'd from that <HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage? And &s;hould not the Unity of God incline us to dete&s;t all &s;piritual Idolatry, which con&s;i&s;ts in giving our Hearts to, tru&s;ting in, and &s;erving of divers Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures, <HI>viz.</HI> The Lu&s;t of the Eye, the Lu&s;t of Fle&s;h, and the Pride of Life. Some make a God of Plea&s;ure, 2 Tim. iii. 4. <HI>Lovers of Plea&s;ures more than Lovers of God.</HI> Mo&s;t certainly, whatever we love more than God, we make a God: Others there be that make Money their God, they make Gold their Hope, and &s;ay to the fine Gold, <HI>thou art my Confidence,</HI> Job. xxxi. 24. Others make a God of their Belly. Philip iii. 19. <HI>Who&s;e God is their Belly. Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> writes of a Fi&s;h <HI>"That hath its Heart in its Belly."</HI> This Fi&s;h is a proper Emblem of Epicures, for their Heart may be &s;aid to be in their Belly; they cheifly mind their Gratification of their &s;en&s;ual Apetite. This is the Evil which God forbids in the fir&s;t Command; and which, in &s;ome Re&s;pect,

&s;eems to exceed in Ba&s;ene&s;s all the Re&s;t which are forbid by the other Precepts: Whatever we put in the Room of God, we may expect will prove a Devil to us.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. If there be but one God, their can be but one Religion, that is true in the World: And hence the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> ob&s;erves, Ephe&s;. iv. 5. That <HI>there is one Faith, one Lord, one Bapti&s;m, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and thro' all, and in you all.</HI> If there were many God's, there might be many Religions, every God would be wor|&s;hip'd in his own Way: But it is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that that God, who is one in his Being, &s;hould appoint &s;everal Religions whereby he would be wor&s;hiped. The Rea&s;on of the Heathens different Rites, was their adoring divers God's, whom they &s;uppo&s;ed they mu&s;t Wor&s;hip in a different Manner: Tho' there be many Ways to Hell, there is but one Road to Heaven, and that is the Path of Faith and Holine&s;s, without which no Man &s;hall enjoy God. It is as Dangerous to &s;et up a Religion, fundamentaly Fal&s;e, as to &s;et up a fal&s;e God; for indeed the one &s;uppo&s;es the other. But</P>
<P N="3">3dly. We &s;hould be excited to enquire, whether this one God be ours in a Covenant Way? Without which we can rea&s;onably take no Comfort in meditating upon this, or any other of his Attributes. Now this we may know by the following Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P N="5">5thly. If we from Love generally obey him before all; becau&s;e he is infinitely higher than all. The Sovereign Lord, the everla&s;ting King, who &s;ways the Scepter over the whole Univer&s;e, (<HI>Acts</HI> iv. 19.)</P>

His Wi&s;dom is Un&s;earchable, his Power Infinite, and his Goodne&s;s Incomprehen&s;ible! As his Wi&s;dom can ea&s;ily devi&s;e a Way for his People's Deliverance in their mo&s;t Perplexing Immergency's, &s;o his Power is able to effect it, Maugre all Oppo&s;ition of Hell and Earth! And his Goodne&s;s as well as Promi&s;e engages his Wi&s;dom and Power in his Peoples behalf. Add to this, that his Immutability &s;ecures their Safety upon an unalterable Foundation! Surely then to u&s;e the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t's</HI> Language, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the People who are in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; yea ble&s;&s;ed is that People, who&s;e God is the Lord!</HI> Well then when our Minds are divided and di&s;tre&s;s'd with a Variety of Fears and Cares, ari&s;ing from a View of the Wars, Debates, and Confu&s;ions in the State and Church, as well as in Families and Neighbourhoods,
<PB N="400" REF="005500_0403_10396733311E3418">
let us bewail Sin, which has introduced all this Confu&s;ion into the World, by breaking that Ble&s;&s;ed Unity which once &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between God and us, and thence en&s;u'd a Breach between Man and Man, between Man and him&s;elf. And having lamented Sin, the Source of Di&s;cord, let us give our whole Heart to one God, who is the Fountain of Sweetne&s;s, Concord and Unity, and humbly rejoyce in him as our All! And earne&s;tly a&s;k of him, that according to the Tenor of his gracious Covenant, he would be pleas'd to give to his People every where one Heart, that they may be one as <HI>Jehovah</HI> is one, and his Name one. (<HI>Ezek.</HI> xi. 19. <HI>Zecha.</HI> xiv. 9.)</P>
<P>But how doleful is the Ca&s;e of all &s;uch who want the a|fore&s;aid Characters; as they are without God &s;o they are without <HI>Hope, Poor, Blind, Mi&s;erable</HI> and <HI>Naked, (Ephe&s;.</HI> ii. 12. <HI>Rev.</HI> iii. 17.) without true Comfort, and without Defence; in the Fullne&s;s of their Sufficiency they are in Want; yea all the Perfections of God are engag'd again&s;t them.

<P>Again from the Doctrine of God's <HI>Unity</HI> we may learn how Wicked the Practice of &s;uch is, who when they have lo&s;t Goods &s;eek to Wizards and familiar Spirits how they may get their Goods again, this is expre&s;ly condemn'd by the Law of God. (<HI>Deut.</HI> viii. xi.) There &s;hall not be found a|ny that con&s;ults with familiar Spirits. 2 Kings. i. 6. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, is it not becau&s;e there is not a God in</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>that thou &s;ende&s;t to enquire of</HI> Baal-zebub, <HI>the God of</HI> Eckron.

The Harbingers of God are frequently proclaiming in our Ears, <HI>Hear O</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>the Lord thy God is one Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Is there but one God?

<P>But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everla&s;ting King: At his Wrath the Earth &s;hall tremble and the Nations &s;hall not be able to abide his Indignation!</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is probable that the Prophecy contain'd in this Chapter, was delivered after the fir&s;t Babyloni&s;h Captivity, becau&s;e it has a double Reference; the fir&s;t Part re&s;pects tho&s;e that were carry'd Captive; and the latter Part re&s;pects tho&s;e that remain'd in the Land of <HI>Pale&s;tine.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophet in the Beginning of this Chapter, fir&s;t Ad|dre&s;&s;es tho&s;e who were carry'd Captive into the Idolatrous Country of the Caldeans, and &s;eriou&s;ly cautions them again&s;t the Infection of it, ver&s;e 1, 2. <HI>Thus &s;ayeth the Lord, learn not the Way of the Heathen.</HI> In the following Ver&s;es the Prophet expo&s;es the Vanity of the Pagan Idolatry, by &s;hew|ing that &s;uch &s;ort of Gods were but the Work of Men's Hands, and had neither Life nor Motion, he therefore ad|vi&s;es them in the 7th ver&s;e, <HI>to cleave to the God of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>a|gain&s;t all Temptation to the Contrary.</HI> This Advice he in|forces in the Words of our Text, by repre&s;enting &s;ome of his Perfections, in Oppo&s;ition to the Idols of the Heathen, <HI>But the Lord is the true God.</HI> The God's of the <HI>Pagans</HI> are vanity and a lye, counterfeit and impo&s;ture; but <HI>Jehovah</HI> is tru|ly and really God, as well as the God of Truth a God who

cannot lie or deceive. <HI>He is the living God.</HI> The <HI>Pagan</HI> Idols are dumb dead Things, that have neither Life, Breath or Motion: But <HI>Jehovah</HI> is <HI>the living God,</HI> i. e. as <HI>Calvin</HI> ju&s;tly explains, <Q>He him&s;elf is endowed with Life, and is to others the Fountain of Life.</Q> P&s;al. xxxvi. 9. <HI>It is in him we live, and move and have our Being.

But on the Contrary the Wrath of <HI>Jehovah</HI> is dreadful, at this the Earth trembles, his Angry frown makes the Worlds Foundations &s;hake and the Pillars of Heaven tremble, and the Nations, were all their Strength united, are as unable to re&s;i&s;t his Al|mighty Indignation, as they are to endure it! <HI>Jehovah</HI> is the God of Nature, the Fountain of Being and Power and therefore all Nature is at his Di&s;po&s;e and Controle, his Empire is Univer&s;al, Ab&s;olute, Eternal; <HI>The Lord &s;hall reign forever, thy God O</HI> Zion <HI>to all Generations!</HI></P>

<P N="1">I. <HI>To prove the Life of God.</HI> And</P>

<P>And then proceed to the <HI>Improvement.</HI> And</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="405" REF="005500_0408_1039672AE82870F8">1&s;t. I am to <HI>prove that God lives.</HI> To this End it may be ob&s;erv'd, that the &s;acred Scriptures frequently a&s;cribe Life to God, and a&s;&s;ure us, that he is the Author of Life to all that po&s;&s;e&s;s it: And hence he is call'd <HI>the living God. (I&s;a.</HI> xxxvii. 17. <HI>Dan.</HI> vi 34. <HI>P&s;a.</HI> lxxxiv. 2. <HI>Mat.</HI> xvi. 16.) And in many other Places which it is needle&s;s to mention. The Almighty is likewi&s;e &s;aid <HI>to be Life it &s;elf. (Col.</HI> iii. 4. 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 20. And <HI>the Fountain of Life, Jer.</HI> ii. 13. <HI>P&s;.</HI> xxxvi. 10.) In him we are &s;aid to <HI>live, move, and have our Being. (Act.</HI> xvii. 28.) The Oath which the Fathers us'd, was <HI>the Lord liveth, (Jer.</HI> v. 2.) And <HI>Jehovah</HI> him|&s;elf &s;wears by nothing but by his Life and Holine&s;s: This Oath is us'd fourteen Times in the Prophe&s;y of <HI>Ezekiel.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover Life is not only attributed to God <HI>e&s;&s;entially,</HI> but <HI>per&s;onally</HI> to each of the &s;acred Three, to <HI>God the Father,</HI> John v. 26. <HI>For as the Father hath Life in him&s;elf, &s;o hath he given to the Son to have Life in him&s;elf.</HI> To God the Son, Joh. xiv. 19. <HI>Becau&s;e I live ye &s;hall live al&s;o.</HI> Hence he is call'd <HI>the Prince of Life,</HI> and that not only becau&s;e he has Life in him&s;elf, by the Father as Mediator, but is al&s;o our Life, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Power of an endle&s;s Life (<HI>Joh.</HI> i. 4. <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 4. <HI>Heb.</HI> vii. 16.) Hence it is &s;aid of him, <HI>Rev.</HI> i. 17, 18. that <HI>he is the fir&s;t and the la&s;t;</HI> that <HI>he liveth and was dead, and behold he is alive forevermore; and that he hath the Keys of Hell and Death.</HI> Tho' his human Nature &s;uffered Death to purcha&s;e Life for his People, yet his divine Nature cannot dye, but lives forever. Life is al&s;o attributed to <HI>God the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> 2. Cor. iii. 3. And hence he is call'd <HI>the Spirit of Life,</HI> Rom. viii. 2.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ures us of this Truth, <HI>that God lives,</HI> by the following Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It appears from the Effects of Life. God <HI>under|&s;tands, wills, loves,</HI> therefore he truly lives: The&s;e are the
<PB N="406" REF="005500_0409_1039672922973980">
Effects of Life, and Effects demon&s;trate the Being and Nature of their Cau&s;e; therefore <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> ju&s;tly and fre|quently concludes from this, <Q>That becau&s;e God under&s;tands all Things, he therefore lives a Ble&s;&s;ed Life.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2dly. Tho&s;e Things live, which move, and &s;tir them|&s;elves. Now God doth all Things of him&s;elf, he is the Fir&s;t, and mo&s;t perfect Cau&s;e of all, he is mo&s;t Active by his E&s;&s;ence, yea a &s;imple Act, he knows, di&s;cerns, wills, works, altogether of him&s;elf, and therefore mu&s;t needs live.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Life is a certain Perfection, which involves no Im|perfection in it. Thus tho&s;e Things that live are reckon'd more perfect than &s;uch as do not, and therefore it cannot with any Shadow of Rea&s;on be deny'd to a Being, that is infinitely Perfect of, and in him&s;elf as <HI>Jehovah</HI> is.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. God is the Fountain of Life to all living Creatures. (<HI>P&s;a.</HI> xxxvi. 10.) And this he could not be if he had not Life him&s;elf; for what one has not he cannot give. Here ob&s;erve 1&s;t. That God is the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Nature;</HI> and hence he is &s;aid to <HI>breath into Man's No&s;trils the Breath of Life. (Gen.</HI> ii. 7.) And in him we are &s;aid <HI>to live and move. (Act.</HI> xvii. 28.) And 2dly <HI>Jehovah</HI> is the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Grace.</HI> Ephe&s;. ix. 10. <HI>Not of Works lea&s;t any Man &s;hould boa&s;t: For we are his Work|man&s;hip, created in</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>unto good Works,</HI>&mdash;3dly. The Almighty is likewi&s;e the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Glory.</HI> Rom. vi. 23. <HI>For the Wages of Sin is Death, but the gift of God is eternal Life thro'</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>our Lord.</HI> Again</P>
<P N="5">5thly. If God did not live, all the re&s;t of his Attributes, and he him&s;elf, would be Vain, and would not differ from the Idols of the <HI>Gentiles, who have Eyes and &s;ee not, Ears and hear not;</HI> and no wonder for they are dead. What would avail all the re&s;t of God's Perfections
<PB N="407" REF="005500_0410_1039672767D9C840">
without Life, &s;eeing that without that, they cannot Act? I proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to explain <HI>the Nature of the divine Life;</HI> which may be thus de&s;crib'd, <HI>viz. That it is an e&s;&s;ential Property of the divine Nature, whereby he is able to perform an infinite Variety of Action to a certain known and valuable End, with Council and Complacency.</HI> Ephe&s;. i. 11. <HI>Who worketh all Things after the Council of his own Will.</HI> That the afore&s;aid De&s;cription may be the better under&s;tood, let the following Particulars be con|&s;idered, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the <HI>Life of God</HI> is his Nature, Being or very E&s;&s;ence; and therefore he is call'd <HI>Life,</HI> as was ob&s;erv'd and prov'd before: Whereas Creatures are only <HI>living,</HI> their Life is but a certain Faculty of their Being, and therefore different from it; but the <HI>Life of God</HI> co-inceeds with his E&s;&s;ence.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The divine Life con&s;i&s;ts in a Power of Action with Complacency: By a Power of Action we intend to &s;ig|nify an Ability in God to produce more Effects without him&s;elf then he doth, and not that the Almighty is at any Time Inactive. No, the Almighty is in continual Action, otherwi&s;e he would &s;uffer a Change which is impo&s;&s;ible; and therefore divines generally and ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, that <HI>the Almighty is a &s;imple Act.</HI> This will farther appear by con&s;idering that tho&s;e Things are &s;aid to live, who act of them&s;elves without being acted, or mov'd either by &s;econd Cau&s;es, (in this &s;en&s;e Life belongs to Creatures) or without any prior moving Cau&s;e at all, and &s;o God him&s;elf Lives: The Life of Creatures &s;prings from &s;ome Compo&s;ition, <HI>e.g. Natural Life</HI> from the Union of the Soul with the Body, which being broke all Power of natural Action cea&s;es: <HI>Spiritual Life</HI> from the Union of the Soul to original Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="408" REF="005500_0411_10396725C63BDEF8">
which being broken all Power of working Spiri|tually cea&s;es. Rom. viii. 8. <HI>Tho&s;e that are in the Fle&s;h can|not plea&s;e God.</HI> And <HI>eternal</HI> Life &s;prings from a perfect Union with God, as the chief Good; which being broken the Soul cannot enjoy God, or rejoyce in him.</P>
<P>Moreover their is a fourfold Life in Creatures, <HI>viz.</HI> Ve|getative, Sen&s;itive, Rational, and Mixt. 1&s;t. A <HI>Vegetative Life</HI> is that whereby Things are able to do that which is requi&s;ite for acquiring and con&s;erving the full Strength of their Nature, and the Propogation of their Kind; this is the Life of Herbs. 2dly. A <HI>&s;en&s;itive Life</HI> is that Faculty whereby Creatures are enabled to di&s;cern Things that are hurtful to them, and Things that are good for them, and to &s;hun the one and &s;eek the other; this is the Life of Bea&s;ts: The&s;e are imperfect Kinds of Life which the meane&s;t Beings enjoy, and therefore cannot be a&s;cribed to God. But 3dly. There is a more noble kind of Life call'd <HI>Rational,</HI> by which the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it is enabled to act with Under|&s;tanding and rea&s;onable Complacency. And 4thly there is a <HI>Mixt Life</HI> which re&s;ults from the two fir&s;t Kinds of Life only, and this belongs to brute Animals, or from all the Three and Exi&s;ts in Men.</P>
<P>Now we mu&s;t not conceive in God any &s;uch imperfect Thing as <HI>Growth</HI> or <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> for he is a &s;imple, &s;piritual, ima|terial and perfect Being. The mo&s;t <HI>perfect Kind of Life</HI> mu&s;t therefore be a&s;crib'd to him, <HI>viz. Rational,</HI> where|by the Being of God is conceiv'd by us, as active Simply of it&s;elf; when in our Ideas of God we adjoin <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Action,</HI> we have a ju&s;t Notion of his Life.</P>
<P>It may be here farther ob&s;erv'd, that a Man hath four Kinds of Faculties in the Exerci&s;e of which he liveth, and Life in him is an Ability to exerci&s;e them: He hath an <HI>Under&s;tanding, Will, Affections,</HI> and a <HI>Power</HI> to <HI>move</HI> and <HI>work outward|ly;</HI>
<PB N="409" REF="005500_0412_10396723CFB81410">
all the&s;e the Almighty a&s;cribes to him&s;elf in his Word. But</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Another Particular, con&s;iderable in the afore&s;aid De|&s;cription of the Life of God, was this, viz. <HI>His acting to &s;ome known and valuable End,</HI> this is but a nece&s;&s;ary Con|&s;equent of acting rationally; an intelligent Agent mu&s;t have &s;ome End in View, and &s;uch an End as is worthy of his Choice. Now the End that God propo&s;es both Scripture and Rea&s;on inform us, is his own Glory, or the Manife&s;ta|tion of his divine Excellency. And hence <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>Pro.</HI> xvi. 4. <HI>That he made all Things for him&s;elf.</HI> This is certainly the mo&s;t noble End, becau&s;e it mo&s;t nearly relates the be&s;t of Beings; and therefore it mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to be the End which the Almighty has chiefly in View in all his Actions, &s;eeing he ever acts with unerring Council.</P>
<P>But tho' there be &s;ome Analogy between the Life of God and that of intelligent Beings, as has been ob&s;erv'd, yet they differ in many Things very widely, as will appear by con&s;i|dering the following Properties of the divine Life, and com|paring them with the Properties of the Lives of Creatures. Now the Divine Life is</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>E&s;&s;ential,</HI> viz. His Nature or Being, as has been ob|&s;erv'd before, whereas the Life of Creatures is but a &s;epara|ble Property, of their Beings, And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Life of God is <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> this re&s;ults unavoid|ably from the former Property, if the Being of God exi&s;ts nece&s;&s;arily of it &s;elf, as it certainly does, as the Name <HI>Jehovah</HI> &s;ignifies, and truly without this he could not be God, and if the divine Life is the &s;ame with it, (as has been ob&s;erv'd) then it mu&s;t be <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary</HI> al&s;o; and hence the Almighty is &s;aid to have Life in him&s;elf: Whereas all Creatures have but a borrow'd precarious and dependant Life communicated to them by God who is the Source of Life.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="410" REF="005500_0413_10396722296C33C8">3dly. The Life of God is <HI>Perfect,</HI> he has the full and perfect Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an interminable Life at once, where|as the Life of Creatures is imperfect, growing by the Ad|dition of Days, Months and Years, our Life glides away in a continual Flux and Succe&s;&s;ion of Moments; but the di|vine Life is an <HI>everla&s;ting NOW,</HI> without any Succe&s;&s;ion in Duration.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The Life of God is <HI>Infinite,</HI> without Beginning or End, hence he is &s;aid <HI>only to have Immortality.</HI> (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> vi. 16.) The Immutability of the divine Nature, as well as his Self-exi&s;tence, &s;hew the impo&s;&s;ibility of his &s;uffering a Change by Death. But on the contrary, the Life of all Creatures had a Beginning, and in re&s;pect of the mo&s;t of them, it will have an End. I proceed to the Improvement of this Sub|ject, And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t the Subject that has been di&s;cours'd upon, offers Matter of Reproof to all &s;uch who behave towards God, as if he were a dumb Idol, that neither &s;aw, heard or under|&s;tood, or could reward or avenge what is done in the World, and who therefore do not love, or fear, or wor&s;hip him, as if he could neither do them <HI>Good or Hurt, Zeph.</HI> i. 12. And in their Straits they are &s;o full of Di&s;tru&s;t and Dejecti|on as if they believ'd there was no God in Heaven who liv'd and &s;aw their Mi&s;eries, and was able to &s;end them Suc|cours &s;uited to them! What can &s;uch Per&s;ons expect who thus make an Idol of God? But that by the Executions of his Wrath, he will make them know to their dreadful Co&s;t, <HI>that he is the Lord.</HI> Ezek. xxxv. 9. But to proceed</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Let us examine our&s;elves, by propo&s;ing the fol|lowing Que&s;tions, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Do we content our&s;elves with having a Name to live when we are dead? If &s;o our Ca&s;e is dreaful! Or</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="411" REF="005500_0414_1039672086E726A0">2dly. Hath the living God quickned <HI>us, when we were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins?</HI> Epe&s;. ii. 4, 5.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Does the &s;uppos'd &s;piritual Life in us, produce Sen&s;e, Breath, Motion, Warmth? Are we at Times &s;orrow|fully &s;en&s;ible of the inward Di&s;orders of our Souls? Does our Unbelief and other Corruptions afflict us? And do we know what the Ab&s;ence of God means, as well as his Pre&s;ence, by our own Experience; do we breath after God in the General above all others? (<HI>P&s;.</HI> lxxiii. 25.) Is it our chief Care and Study for the mo&s;t Part to grow in Grace? And does our principal Zeal and Warmth generally run in a religious Channel?</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Do we generally labour to &s;erve the living God in a living Way? i. e. Not only with rais'd Affections, but approaching to him thro' CHRIST the new and living Way, <HI>the Way, the Truth and the Life?</HI> Heb. x. 20.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Have we &s;orrow'd for the great Evil <HI>of for&s;aking the living God, the Fountain of living Waters, and running to broken Ci&s;terns?</HI> Jer. ii. 13. And do we watch over our Unbelief, <HI>that we depart no more from him?</HI> Heb. iii. 12.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. Is God the Foundation of our Hope and Tru&s;t, and nothing el&s;e be&s;ides him? (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> vi. 17.)</P>
<P>To &s;uch as can an&s;wer in the Affirmative to the afore|&s;aid Que&s;tions, (the fir&s;t excepted) this Subject mini&s;ters Comfort in every Di&s;tre&s;s, being per&s;waded that our Redeemer lives, and that he is the Strength of our Life, particularly (1&s;t.) in the <HI>Difficulties</HI> of a <HI>Natural Life,</HI> if Sickne&s;s threatens an End of it, if Poverty removes the Supports of Life, if Enemies &s;eek it, and lay Snares to de&s;troy it, if the Fear of Death and Horror of Putrifaction and Pain perplex us? What yields a &s;weeter Support, in tho&s;e and &s;uch like Ca&s;es, than to think that our God and Redeemer lives, yea that he is Life it &s;elf, and the Fountain thereof: As he
<PB N="412" REF="005500_0415_1039671EDE576520">
has given Life, &s;o he can pre&s;erve it in the mid&s;t of all Dangers, and again&s;t the Force of all Enemies, yea he can re&s;tore it when lo&s;t, <HI>for he is the Re&s;urrection and the Life!</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. In the <HI>Difficulties</HI> of the <HI>&s;piritual Life,</HI> when we find our&s;elves cold and dead, unfit for, and unable to perform the Duties of Religion, how &s;upporting and &s;weet is it to think <HI>that as the Father hath Life in him&s;elf, &s;o hath he given to the Son to have Life in him&s;elf, that we might have Life in him.</HI> 1 John iv. 9. <HI>Yea that he is our Life.</HI> Col. iii. 4. And</P>
<P N="3">3dly. In the <HI>Difficulties</HI> of <HI>Eternal Life:</HI> When the Fear of Death and the Body of Death pain us, &s;o that we are oblig'd to &s;igh and &s;ay, <HI>who &s;hall deliver us?</HI> Men and Brethren what &s;hall we do to inherit eternal Life? In this Ca&s;e how &s;weet is it to think that God lives, and is the great Source of Life; and likewi&s;e that the Redeemer lives, and is our Life? Yea that to this End he was given by his Father, that <HI>we &s;hould not peri&s;h but have eternal Life</HI> (To this Purpo&s;e was his Death, that <HI>he might purcha&s;e Life for us</HI>) And al&s;o that the Holy Spirit is a Spirit of Life who quickens? (<HI>Joh.</HI> vi. 63.)</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The Con&s;ideration of the infinite or immortal Life of God, may ju&s;tly humble us who carry our Breath, our Life, in our No&s;trils, and are liable to &s;uch a manifold Death, <HI>viz.</HI> Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal, who may be &s;peedily depriv'd of Life by the meane&s;t Infects, the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Incidents, as both Scripture and Hi&s;tory in|forms us, and who have brought our&s;elves into this mortal State by Sin! 2 Sam. xiv. 14. <HI>For we mu&s;t needs die, and are as Water &s;pilt on the Ground, which cannot be gathered up again.</HI> P&s;al. cxliv. 3.4. <HI>Lord what is Man that thou take&s;t Knowledge of him. Man is like to Vanity, his Days are as a Shaddow that pa&s;&s;eth away.</HI> Our Life is like a Flower

of the Gra&s;s, <HI>which flouri&s;hes in the Morning, but in the E|vening is cut down and withereth,</HI> P&s;al. xc. 5.6. <HI>What is our Life,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle James, <HI>but a Vapour which ap|pears for a little time, and then vani&s;heth away. Man that is born of a Woman,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Job, is of few Days and full of Trouble, he cometh forth like a Flower and is cut down, he fleeth al&s;o as a Shadow and continueth not.</HI> As <HI>Bernard</HI> ob|&s;erves, <Q>In the&s;e Words is de&s;crib'd the &s;hortne&s;s, certainty, frailty and manifold Adver&s;ity of our Life.</Q> How much therefore may we be humbled, when we compare our Life with the Life of God? What are we but Du&s;t and A&s;hes? And if our Life be &s;o &s;hort and uncertain, how vain mu&s;t all the Enjoyments of Life be? Seeing they cannot be bet|ter to us than that on which they depend! O therefore let us be wean'd from the dying Things of Time and Breath after Immortality! Let us earne&s;tly &s;eek it in the immortal God, that when our Heart and Fle&s;h fails, he may be the Strength of our Heart, and our Portion for Ever!</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The Con&s;ideration of the Life of God &s;hould excite us to glorify him in Imitation of the heavenly Ho&s;t. Rev. iv. 9.10. <HI>When tho&s;e Bea&s;ts gave Glory and Honour and Thanks to him, that &s;at on the Throne, who liveth for ever and ever. The Four and Twenty Elders fall down before him that &s;at on the Throne, and wor&s;hip him that liveth for ever and ever, and ca&s;t their Crowns before the Throne.</HI> I &s;ay we &s;hould glorify God, not only becau&s;e he has Life, which is a Primary Perfection of Mankind, but by the Help of which all their Faculties are actuated, and with|out which they would be Vain: Thus the Life of God actuates all his other Attributes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But becau&s;e he is Life it &s;elf, yea &s;uch a Life as is Independent, Infinite, eter|nal Immutable, and the Author of all that Life which
<PB N="414" REF="005500_0417_1039671B907C4E70">
every Creature enjoys: It's on the&s;e Accounts that God doth &s;o often glory of his Life, as well as &s;wear by it, and thereby di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf from fal&s;e God's who are but dead Idols.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing that Jehovah is the original of our natural and &s;piritual Life, and is to be &s;o of our eternal likewi&s;e, to purcha&s;e which he gave his only begotten Son to Death, let us ever retain a grateful Sen&s;e of this in our Minds, and cele|brate the Prai&s;es of God for it in Speech and Action!</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> The Con&s;ideration of <HI>the Life of God,</HI> &s;hould incline us to live to him! Which con&s;i&s;ts principally in the following Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. In <HI>directing</HI> all our <HI>Actions,</HI> whether Natural, Civil or Religious, <HI>to his Glory,</HI> as our highe&s;t Mark. 1 Cor. x. 31. <HI>Whether therefore ye Eat or Drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> 2dly. In <HI>conforming our Actions</HI> according to his <HI>revealed Will.</HI> 1 Pet. iv. 2. <HI>That he no longer &s;hould live the re&s;t of his time in the Fle&s;h, to the Lu&s;ts of Men, but to the Will of God.</HI> 3dly. It con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>living by the Power of God,</HI> i. e. when we being &s;en&s;ible of our inability to do what is plea&s;ing to God, depend upon his A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Influence. (<HI>Gal</HI> ii. 19.20.) Now the <HI>Life of God</HI> affords a manifold Argu|ment of living to him. For 1&s;t. Our God lives, and in his Life con&s;i&s;ts his chief Perfection, and ours in Imitation of it. 2dly. He is the Author of our Life, and therefore it is but rea&s;onable it &s;hould be referred to him. 3dly. Our Re|deemer has Life in him&s;elf, is our Life, yea <HI>has died that we might live; not to our&s;elves but to him that has dyed for us.</HI> 2 Cor v. 15. 4thly. The <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> is a Spirit of Life, who quickens poor dead and &s;tupid Sinners, by Virtue of his Office. (<HI>Joh.</HI> vi. 63.) O! therefore while we do live, let us live to the living God, and labour to be fervent and and lively in his Service; in this Way we may expect, in

due Time, to be tran&s;lated thro' divine Grace, into a State of immortal Life and Glory. And &s;uch as are under the Power of &s;piritual Death, which you may know by your being without &s;piritual Sen&s;e, Breath and Motion, I exhort in the Language of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> chap. v. 14. <HI>Awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t, ari&s;e from the Dead and Chri&s;t &s;hall give you Light!

Ari&s;e call upon thy God if &s;o be that he will pitty you that you peri&s;h not!</HI> While you are thus &s;piritually Dead, you can have neither Communion with the living God here, nor enjoy him hereafter, but are under his Cur&s;e and Wrath. The Law you have broken condemns you, Gal. iii. 10. <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all Things that are writ|ten in the Book of the Law to do them.</HI> The Go&s;pel al&s;o which you believe not likewi&s;e rejects you! Mark xvi. 12. Heaven is &s;hut up again&s;t you, and Hell is open to receive you! Your Services mu&s;t needs be loath&s;ome becau&s;e they are Dead!

O think frequently and &s;olemnly of your doleful Ca&s;e and cry fervently and unweariedly to the living God for &s;piritual Life, without which you mu&s;t eternally feel the Power of the &s;econd Death.</P>
<P>Poor Sinners! Are not the plain Signs of Spiritual Death upon you? For is not your Eyes clo&s;e &s;hut? You have no affecting apprehen&s;ion of your Di&s;ea&s;e and Danger, nor of the Remedy a gracious God has provided for peri&s;h|ing Souls!</P>

When we unvail the Di&s;mal Vault of Hell, and &s;et it before you in all it's flaming Terrors, yauning Wide to devour you! When we repre&s;ent the Vengeance of Omnipotence hanging over your Guilty Heads, as a gloomy Cloud, Pregnant with woe and Ruin, every Moment ready to break upon you in a formidable re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Torrent, and drown you in De|&s;truction! When we take the Sword of God and point it at your Hearts, alas ye do not feel the Thru&s;t, or grieve o|ver your Mi&s;ery! When we bend the legal Bow and &s;hoot at your Bo&s;oms, the Arrows rebound as if they &s;truck on a Wall of Marble, and make no abidding Impre&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>And when we &s;peak in &s;ofter Strains of the humble Charms of divine Grace and Love, and pronounce Ble&s;&s;ings upon all believing Penitents from the Summit of <HI>Gere&s;im!</HI> Alas ye feel it not, but are as in&s;en&s;ible as Stones, as dead Corps!

The Conde&s;cention of the Son of God in a&s;&s;uming our Na|ture, under its pre&s;ent ruinous Circum&s;tances, his appear|ing in the Form of a Servant, <HI>who was God over all ble&s;&s;ed for ever,</HI> his becoming poor, that we might be made rich, in a Word his being expos'd to all the In&s;tances of Hard|&s;hip, Ignominy and Contempt in Life, and at la&s;t to a mo&s;t painful and &s;hameful Death, is enough to affect any who have the lea&s;t Spark of Life!

Me thinks the Songs, the Shouts, the harminious Ho&s;anahs of all the Ho&s;ts of Hea|ven invite you to <HI>awake,</HI> without which ye cannot be admitted into their honourable and happy Society, and join in their delightful Anthems with greatful Accents, be&s;ides the dolorous Groans and hideous Scrieks of damned Men, and damned Angels, in the flaming Furnace of Tophet, may ju&s;tly alarm you out of your accur&s;ed Stupor: For after a few Moments, ye mu&s;t roar with them, except ye repent! Nothing but the abus'd Patience of God and the &s;lender Thread of your Life, keep you from plunging down into that flaming Lake, that burning Main! And for what you
<PB N="419" REF="005500_0422_10396713313E75E8">
know the Patience of God may expire towards you before the next Mornings Light, and then you are undone! un|done! undone forever! O if the Thread of your Life breaks while you remain in this dead State, you are gone pa&s;t all Hopes forever, Dead and Damned at once, yea Damned to all Eternity! And how many Accidents are you inviron'd with? Are not many carry'd off &s;peedily and unexpectedly? And why may not this be your Ca&s;e? I be&s;eech you Friends by all the Happine&s;s of Heaven, by all the Torments of Hell, for the Sake of God the Father, Son and Spirit, by all the Regard you owe to your Deathle&s;s Souls, your Rea&s;on, your Con&s;cience, as well as the Amba&s;&s;adors of CHRIST a|mong you, that ye would <HI>awake.</HI> I be&s;eech you as a Me&s;|&s;enger of the great God, as on my bended Knees, by the Groans, Tears, and Wounds of CHRIST, that you would <HI>Awake.</HI> Yea I charge you by all the Cur&s;es of the Law, and Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel, that ye would <HI>Awake.</HI> My Friends, you are witne&s;&s;es again&s;t your&s;elves, that I have &s;et Death and Life before you, O choo&s;e Life that ye may live! <HI>Let the wicked Man for&s;ake his Way, and the unrigh|teous Man his Thoughts, and turn to God and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God for he will abundantly par|don!</HI> O Sirs! con&s;ider the&s;e Things, as ye will an&s;wer it at the Tribunal of CHRIST at the la&s;t Day.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>I. JOHN v. 7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For there are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Gho&s;t, and The&s;e three are One.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Doctrine of the Trinity, is undoubtedly of the highe&s;t Importance in Chri&s;tianity: For the whole Scheme of Redemption is built upon this funda|mental Point, namely, That God the Father did from all Eternity purpo&s;e to &s;end his only begotten Son in|to the World to a&s;&s;ume human Nature that therein he might &s;atisfy divine Ju&s;tice, by his Suffering and Obedience. That the Son of God in the fulne&s;s of Time, did as Me|diator, obey his Father's Injunctions, in enduring that Weight of Wrath, which was due for the Sins of the Elect World, and that it is the Office of the Holy Spirit to make effectu|al Application of the Purcha&s;e of CHRIST to them. Now if the Di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons in the Trinity be remov'd, the&s;e Things cannot be con&s;i&s;tently &s;upported: For it is ab|&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;ame Per&s;on &s;hould &s;end him&s;elf, and &s;atisfy him&s;elf, &amp;c. And thus the whole Fabrick of Chri&s;tianity in re&s;pect of its grand Peculiars would &s;ink, its Foundation being de&s;troy'd, and the Religion of Nature take Place of reveal'd.</P>
<P>But tho' the Doctrine of the Trinity, be of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t. Im|portance in the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem, yet it is incomprehen&s;ible!
<PB N="421" REF="005500_0424_1039670FA7930310">
Neither &s;hould this be wondred at, &s;eeing there are di|vers Things in Nature, which we cannot fully conceive of or explain, &s;uch as the Rea&s;on of the Growth, and different Colours, as well as Shapes of Vegetables, and of the various in&s;tincts of brute Animals. Not to mention the Nature of our own Souls, their Union with our Bodies, and Way of acting upon them. If Things that are of a finite Nature do thus poze and nonplu&s;s our weak Under&s;tandings, is it &s;trange that the infinite Perfections of the divine Nature &s;hould tran&s;cend the Comprehen&s;ion of a finite Mind? The Di&s;tance being &s;o va&s;t between the Object, and our Fa|culties.</P>
<P>Neither is it unrea&s;onable to believe, what we have no equal or adequate Ideas of, el&s;e we mu&s;t believe in none of the divine Attributes: For every of tho&s;e &s;urpa&s;s the highe&s;t Flight, the utmo&s;t Verge of a Creatures Thought. e. g. Altho' natural Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ures us, that there is a God, and that Self-exi&s;tence is nece&s;&s;arily included among the Number of his unalienable Perfections, yet how imperfect is the Idea we form of it? We are likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured by the cleare&s;t Dictates of unbias'd Rea&s;on, that God is immen&s;e without Extention, and eternal without Succe&s;&s;ion in Duration. But what po&s;itive Image can our Minds form of &s;uch Things? Are not our Thoughts &s;wal|lowed up and lo&s;t in Ob&s;curity when we try to gra&s;p &s;uch &s;ublime and incomprehen&s;ible Objects? We may be there|fore truly &s;aid to believe more concerning God, than we do or can comprehend; otherwi&s;e indeed, we do not be|lieve the Being of a God at all: For whatever our Under|&s;tandings gra&s;p, cannot, but like it &s;elf, be finite, and what|ever is finite is not God. That there are certain Perfecti|ons in God, both Scripture and Rea&s;on inform us, but how the&s;e are in God, we cannot fully conceive or expre&s;s! No doubt Faith &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome Idea or Knowledge of the Ob|ject,
<PB N="422" REF="005500_0425_1039670E05840490">
but this Knowledge admits of various Degrees; &s;ome|times it reaches no farther than the Proof of the Exi&s;tence of Things, together with &s;ome negative Ideas or Appre|hen&s;ion of what they are not; and &s;ometimes it extends to the Manner of their Exi&s;tence, and therefore it is &s;o far from being ab&s;urd, that it is nece&s;&s;ary, for the Rea&s;on afore&s;aid, to believe that there is &s;omething in God, which we can|not gra&s;p.</P>
<P>Seeing then the Doctrine of the Trinity, is &s;o important and intricate. It was well ob&s;erv'd by <HI>Au&s;tine</HI> of old re|&s;pecting it, <Q>That in nothing Men are apt to err more ea|&s;ily and dangerou&s;ly.</Q> <HI>(In nihilo facilius, et periculo&s;ius erratur)</HI> But how contrary to this, is the unrea&s;onable Notion of &s;ome Moderns, who plead for the innocency of Errors of the gro&s;e&s;t Kind, at lea&s;t of tho&s;e that are &s;incere Enquirers after Truth, who are notwith&s;tanding far from it? As tho' their Endeavours would entitle them to Happine&s;s, with|out the Knowledge of Fundamentals.</P>
<P><Q>But &s;urely, it is not the Sincerity of our Enquiries after important Truths, but the Succe&s;s thereof, that is to be re|garded in this, as well as other Means that are us'd to obtain &s;o valuable an End, we may as well &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;incere Endeavours to obtain many of tho&s;e Graces that accompany Salvation, &s;uch as Faith, Love to God, and Evangelical Obedience, will &s;upply or attone for the Want of them, as a&s;&s;ert that our in&s;ucce&s;sful Enquiries af|ter the great Doctrines of Religion will excu&s;e our Igno|rance thereof, e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that Blindne&s;s of Mind, as well as hardne&s;s of Heart, is included among tho&s;e &s;piritual Judgments, which are the Con&s;equence of our fallen State. And al&s;o that God di&s;plays the Sove|reignty of his Grace, as much in leading the Soul into all nece&s;&s;ary Truth, as he does in any other Things that re|late
<PB N="423" REF="005500_0426_1039670C5B373578">
to Salvation. However it is not our Bu&s;ine&s;s to de|termine, the final States of Men, but rather to pray that the Ignorant and Erronious may be brought to the ac|knowledgment of the Truth.</Q></P>
<P>In the mean Time we may truly &s;ay, that Errors in Doc|trine, (e&s;pecially when they touch the Foundation of Religi|on) are very perilous, as well as Errors in Practice. And hence we read of damnable Here&s;ies. But how far Error in Opinion may con&s;i&s;t with a gracious State, we cannot preci&s;ely and peremtorily determine. It is therefore extream|ly nece&s;&s;ary, to attend with the utmo&s;t Care and Caution to what the &s;acred Scriptures relate concerning the Trinity, and to beware of giving a lawle&s;s Loo&s;e to our own Imagi|nations: For it is better, as one well ob&s;erves <Q>To be Ig|norant of the Depths of it, than not to retain the Limits of Truth concerning it. <HI>Melius e&s;t ne&s;cire Centrum, quam non tenere circulum.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now the Text I have cho&s;en to di&s;cour&s;e upon, gives us an excellent De&s;cription of the important Point under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration in three Particulars; for 1&s;t. Here we have a Trinity of Per&s;ons a&s;&s;erted, mention is made of <HI>Three,</HI> and a per&s;onal Action a&s;crib'd to them, namely, that of <HI>bear|ing Witne&s;s; There are Three that bear Record in Heaven.</HI> Now the Matter of this Witne&s;s or Te&s;timony is, that JESUS is the Son of God, and the Me&s;&s;iah promis'd, as appears from the 1&s;t. 5th. and 9th. Ver&s;es of this Chapter, the <HI>Manner</HI> rather than the <HI>Place</HI> of the Te&s;timony, is &s;ignify'd by tho&s;e Words, <HI>in Heaven.</HI> The Sacred Three have and do bear Witne&s;s in a maje&s;tick and glorious Way to the afore&s;aid Truth: Thus the Father te&s;tify'd of the Man JESUS, by an immediate Voice from Heaven, at his Bapti&s;m, this <HI>is my beloved Son hear ye him,</HI> the eternal Word own'd it's per&s;onal Union with the a&s;&s;um'd human Nature, on the
<PB N="424" REF="005500_0427_1039670AB4838EC8">
Mount of Transfiguration, by that divine Glory wherewith it was there cloth'd. Joh. i. 14. <HI>And we beheld his Glory, the Glory, as of the only Begotten of the Father full of Grace and Truth.</HI> And the Holy Spirit likewi&s;e witne&s;&s;ed by de&s;ending vi&s;ibly upon him like a Dove at his Bapti&s;m. And 2dly. The Names of the &s;acred Three are expre&s;s'd, <HI>viz.</HI> the Father, Word, and Spirit. The fir&s;t Per&s;on of the Trinity is call'd Father, to &s;ignify his eternal Generation of the Son. The &s;econd Per&s;on is call'd the Word in our Text, and in other Places of Scripture. (<HI>See John.</HI> i. 1. 1 <HI>John</HI> i. 1.) To expre&s;s not only his Office in the <HI>Revela|tion</HI> of his Fathers Will to us, (<HI>Mat.</HI> xi. 27.) but al&s;o his ineffable Generation, as a Word is begotten in our Thoughts and is the expre&s;s Image of them. The Third Per&s;on of the Trinity is call'd <HI>Gho&s;t</HI> or Spirit to &s;ignify his Per&s;onal Property, which is to proceed from the Father and the Son, the Manner of which &s;eems to be &s;hadow'd forth by breath|ing; for as much as the Word Spirit is deriv'd of a Verb, which &s;ignifies to breath. <HI>(pnewma a pneo &s;piro)</HI> Now the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit is call'd <HI>Holy,</HI> to &s;ignify what is his peculiar Office in the divine <HI>OEconomy,</HI> re&s;pecting the Salvation of the Elect which is to make them Holy by his efficacious Influences.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to di&s;cour&s;e farther upon this Text, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to offer &s;omething concerning its divine Original. It is true &s;everal learned Men acknowledge, that it is not found in divers ancient Manu&s;crips, and Ver&s;ions drawn from them. But what then, it is found in many o|thers, as <HI>Beza</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>Jerom</HI> a&s;&s;erts in his Letter to <HI>Eu&s;io|chius,</HI> That <HI>it was contain'd in all the</HI> Greek <HI>Copies of his Time,</HI> and complains <HI>that it was omitted thro the Negligence of the Latin Interpreters.</HI> Now it is certain that <HI>Jerom</HI> was one of the mo&s;t learned of the Fathers, in re&s;pect of the Languages and Church Hi&s;tory. What tho' this Text
<PB N="425" REF="005500_0428_1039670913EC7E90">
was omitted in Writings of the Fathers of the fourth Cen|tuary, it might be wanting in the Copies they con&s;ulted, and be in others notwith&s;tanding: But methinks it is e|nough to &s;atisfy us in this Point, that it is not only menti|on'd frequently by the Writers of &s;ucceeding Ages, but al|&s;o by &s;ome of the third Century, particularly by <HI>Cyprian</HI> and <HI>Tertulian. Cyprian</HI> wrote before the Birth of <HI>Arius,</HI> in the third Century, and endur'd Martyrdom in the Year 260: And it is certain that he had not &s;uch an allegorical or my&s;tical Turn of Mind, as <HI>Origen</HI> and &s;ome others, and therefore his Te&s;timony is the more to be depended upon. In his Epi&s;tle concerning the Unity of the Church he hath the&s;e Words, <HI>viz. The Lord &s;ayeth, that I, and the Father are one; and again it is written, concerning the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, and the&s;e Three are one. (dicit Dominus, ego et Pater unum Sumus, et itrum de patre et filio. et &s;piritu &s;ancto Scriptum e&s;t, et hi tre&s; unum &s;unt.)</HI> Now the mo&s;t antient Manu&s;cript extant in the World, which &s;ome &s;ay is at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> is not &s;uppos'd by any to reach &s;o far back as the third Century. It is likewi&s;e thought by &s;ome learned Men, that <HI>Tertulian</HI> in his Book again&s;t <HI>Praxeas,</HI> refers to this Text in the&s;e Words, <HI>which Three are one. (qui tres unum &s;unt)</HI> <Q>To what has been &s;aid, I may add, that Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> ob&s;erves in his <HI>Synop&s;is, that</HI> Athana&s;ius <HI>in his fir&s;t Book to</HI> Theophilus <HI>and</HI> Idacius <HI>who flouri&s;h'd in the Year</HI> 308 <HI>under</HI> Theodo&s;ius, <HI>produc'd this Place of Scripture again&s;t the</HI> Arians.</Q> This Ver&s;e might be omitted in &s;ome Manu&s;crips thro' the Carele&s;ne&s;s of the Tran&s;criber, but could not be added without an evil De&s;ign; which it is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e in this Ca&s;e, becau&s;e it could not be an&s;wered by &s;uch an Addition, &s;eeing the Trinity is el&s;ewhere fully a&s;&s;erted, as I &s;hall afterwards prove: It is therefore much more probable, that the <HI>Arians</HI> have
<PB N="426" REF="005500_0429_103967076E516430">
corrupted this Place of Scripture, than the Orthodox, &s;eeing that it &s;o directly over&s;ets their Here&s;y; whereas the oppo&s;ite Doctrine is &s;ufficiently confirm'd by other Places; and both <HI>Ambro&s;e (de fide)</HI> and <HI>Socrates</HI> in his eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Hi&s;tory, do witne&s;s, that the <HI>Arians</HI> were Guilty of this Kind of Fraud; neither was it difficult for them to effect it, when &s;ome of their Number, namely, <HI>Con&s;tantius</HI> and <HI>Valens,</HI> po&s;&s;es'd the imperial Throne and bani&s;h'd the Orthodox; and in the mean Time fix'd <HI>Arian</HI> Bi&s;hops almo&s;t over the whole Chri&s;tian World. I might add, if it was nece&s;&s;ary, that the Genuine&s;s of this Text might be defended from it's Conection with the preceeding Ver&s;es, and the Scope of the Place. But it's Time that I &s;hould pro|ceed to propo&s;e a Method of di&s;cour&s;ing upon the Subject our Text contains, which &s;hall be as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall offer &s;ome Con&s;iderations &s;erving to prove and explain <HI>a Trinity in the Godhead.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I &s;hall labour to prove, by divers Arguments, <HI>their Unity therein, or that each of the &s;acred Three is truly and properly God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. An&s;wer the mo&s;t <HI>important Objections.</HI></P>
<P>And then proceed to the Improvement of the whole.</P>
<P>That there be Three in the Godhead the Scripture teaches &s;o often as it makes mention of more who are God, and this is done in all tho&s;e Places wherein the Almighty &s;peaks of him&s;elf in the plural Number. (<HI>See Gen.</HI> i. 26. <HI>and</HI> iii. 22. <HI>and</HI> xi. 7.) <HI>Let us make Man, &amp;c.</HI> Neither is the Cavil of the modern Jews, re&s;pecting tho&s;e Places of Scripture, of any Validity, viz. That God &s;peaks to the Angels, or to the Heaven or Earth, or Elements, and calls them to a Partner&s;hip in the Creation, or that he &s;peaks of him&s;elf alone after the Manner of great Men: But how Ridiculous is it to &s;uppo&s;e that Angels, or any other
<PB N="427" REF="005500_0430_10396705C1DB8660">
Creature, &s;hould be call'd to any Fellow&s;hip in Creation, which is a Work of Almighty Power, or that infinite Wi&s;|dom &s;hould be nonplus'd, and need Council of Creatures! Neither does the Stile of the Modern great ones &s;uit the Scriptures, or Cu&s;tom of the ea&s;tern Nations; it was two late receiv'd by the we&s;tern World to determine this Point! It may be further ob&s;erv'd, that the afore&s;aid Phra&s;e does not exactly agree with the Cu&s;tom of the Moderns; for they &s;ay not we Kings of <HI>England,</HI> or we <HI>George's,</HI> but <HI>we</HI> George <HI>the King.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e Places of Scripture whereby <HI>Jehovah</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;h'd from <HI>Jehovah,</HI> do proclaim a Plurality of Per|&s;ons in the God-head (<HI>See Gen.</HI> xix. 24. <HI>Ex.</HI> xxxiv. 5. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xii. 24.25.) Surely <HI>Jehovah</HI> is not di&s;tingui&s;h'd from <HI>Jehovah</HI> by his E&s;&s;ence, &s;eeing there is but one God; (<HI>Deut.</HI> vi. 4.) or by Accidents, for &s;uch do not belong to the Almighty, and therefore the Di&s;tinction mu&s;t be per&s;o|nal. A Trinity of Per&s;ons is likewi&s;e &s;ignifi'd in tho&s;e Places of Scripture, where the Name of God is divers Times repeated in the &s;ame Sentence, which it would be Pro|phane to &s;uppo&s;e was Tautological. (<HI>See Deut.</HI> vi. 4. <HI>Exo.</HI> iii. 15. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> vi. 3.) <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Ho&s;ts;</HI> but in the New-Te&s;tament this Truth is more expre&s;ly a&s;|&s;erted, <HI>Mat.</HI> iii. 16.17. <HI>And JESUS when he was Bap|tiz'd, went up &s;traitway out of the Water,</HI> (or as the origi|nal Word <HI>Apo,</HI> is el&s;ewhere ju&s;tly render'd by the &s;ame Interpreters <HI>from the Water) and lo the Heavens were open'd unto him, and he &s;aw the Spirit of God de&s;ending like a Dove and lighting upon him, and lo a Voice from Heaven, &s;aying this is my belov'd Son in whom I am well pleas'd.</HI> This Place is &s;o expre&s;s to the Point, that it was a common &s;aying among the Antient Fathers, viz. <HI>Go to</HI> Jordan <HI>and you will &s;ee the Trinity,</HI> Mat. xxviii. 19. <HI>Go therefore teach all Nati|ons
<PB N="428" REF="005500_0431_10396703F24A9688">
in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Surely we &s;hould not be baptiz'd in the Name of one who is not God. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 14. <HI>The Grace of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and the Love of God, and the Com|munion of the Holy Gho&s;t, be with you all Amen.</HI> Here three di&s;tinct Ble&s;&s;ings are de&s;ir'd for the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> from the &s;acred Three in the God-head, namely, <HI>Love</HI> from the Father, <HI>Grace</HI> from the Son, and <HI>Communion</HI> from the Holy-Gho&s;t. Now that tho&s;e &s;acred Three are di&s;tinct Per&s;ons, appears by the following Con&s;iderations, The Word <HI>Hypo&s;ta&s;is,</HI> &s;ignifies as much as Sub&s;i&s;tence or Per&s;on, and this is expre&s;ly apply'd to the Father, of which the Son is &s;aid <HI>to be the expre&s;s Image, Heb.</HI> i. 3. And what can this intend but that he is a Per&s;on al&s;o? Now by a a Parity of Rea&s;on the &s;ame mu&s;t be likewi&s;e &s;aid of the Holy Gho&s;t: But &s;eeing the Father's per&s;onallity is not di&s;|puted, it will be only nece&s;&s;ary to add &s;omewhat concern|ing the Per&s;onality of the Son and Holy-Gho&s;t. To this End it may be ob&s;erv'd, that per&s;onal Characters are a&s;crib'd to the &s;econd Per&s;on of the Trinity: Hence he is call'd a <HI>Son,</HI> which denotes a di&s;tinct Per&s;on from the Father. He is likewi&s;e &s;aid <HI>to be &s;ent into the World by his Father;</HI> which cannot, without the greate&s;t Impropriety, be apply'd to a mere Relation or Quality: He is likewi&s;e call'd a <HI>Surety &amp;c.</HI> And three Offices are a&s;crib'd to him as &s;uch, by each of which he is call'd. It may be al&s;o farther ob&s;erv'd that &s;ome of the afore&s;aid Characters are never a&s;crib'd to a|ny of the other Per&s;ons of the Trinity; be&s;ides the Second, the Father and Holy Spirt, are never call'd the Son, are never &s;aid to be made fle&s;h, or to become Sureties for peri&s;h|ing Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors: Not to add that the per&s;onal Characters, He, Thy, Thou, are apply'd to the Son. <HI>P&s;.</HI> cx. 7. <HI>He &s;hall drink of the Brook in the Way.</HI> Ver&s;e 3. <HI>Thy People

<P>But to proceed, it appears likewi&s;e, that the Holy Gho&s;t is a divine Per&s;on from the per&s;onal Properties a&s;crib'd to him in Scripture, thus he is &s;aid <HI>to act by &s;overeign Plea&s;ure.

It will not follow that many Hundreds of Places re&s;pecting the Trinity, where no lofty Expre&s;&s;ion is us'd, &s;hould be taken without any Nece&s;&s;ity, without any Notice from the Context in the &s;ame Sen&s;e. Surely fundamentals in Religion are plainly expre&s;s'd, and not perpetually immur'd and vail'd in Tropes and Figures, and &s;o rendered inacce&s;|&s;ible to a vulgar Under&s;tanding, otherwi&s;e we &s;hould be left to the greate&s;t Uncertainty in the mo&s;t important and momen|tuous Points, notwith&s;tanding of the Revelation given us, which can hardly con&s;i&s;t with the Divine Goodne&s;s. If per&s;onal Characters, when apply'd to Men and Angels, are taken in a proper Sen&s;e, why &s;hould they not when ap|ply'd to the &s;acred Three, who tho' they have not di&s;tinct Beings, yet have an Under&s;tanding and Will, and there|fore are capable of Per&s;onality, and indeed to take the a|fore&s;aid Places of Scripture, and all the re&s;t that relate to the Per&s;onallity of the Son and Holy Gho&s;t in a figurative Sen&s;e, manife&s;tly tends to overthrow the Per&s;onallity of the Fa|ther, which is prov'd by the &s;ame Method's.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="005500_0433_10396700418EF0E8">But to make the Way more plain, for what may be afterwards offered, it may be here ob&s;erv'd, that by the Word <HI>Trinity,</HI> we mean no more, than that the divine E&s;|&s;ence, which is one, is common to three Per&s;ons, namely, <HI>the Father, Son, and Spirit,</HI> who are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by three Manners of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. Altho' the Word <HI>Trinity</HI> is not ex|pre&s;&s;ly mentioned in Scripture, yet what is thereby &s;ignifi|ed, is agreeable thereto, as appears from what has been, and what may be (God willing) farther offered, and therefore its proper that the Term be retain'd, until a better be found to &s;upply the Room thereof. By E&s;&s;ence we under&s;tand what the Scriptures term the Nature of God, <HI>(Phu&s;is) Gal.</HI> vi. 8. the Form of God <HI>(Morphe) Phil.</HI> ii. the Godhead <HI>(Theotes) Colo&s;.</HI> ii. 9. In &s;hort the divine E&s;&s;ence is that whereby God, is God: For that whereby any Thing is what it is, is call'd its E&s;&s;ence. The Word Per&s;on or Sub&s;i&s;tence (which is the &s;ame) is a &s;criptural Term, <HI>Heb.</HI> i. 3. Our Text affirms that there are <HI>Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Then there are three Somethings in the Godhead, but what are they, not three di&s;tinct Sub&s;tances, or E&s;&s;ences, otherwi&s;e there would be unavoidably three Gods, which is bla&s;phe|mous to imagine; not three Accidents, for the&s;e belong not to God, becau&s;e of his Simplicity and Immutability, not three Relations, for the&s;e cannot act or bear witne&s;s. What then can they be but Per&s;ons? If any don't like this &s;crip|tural Name, let them produce a better if they can.</P>
<P>The Word Per&s;on, &s;ome de&s;cribe to be <Q>a rational in|communicable Sub&s;tance.</Q> And others, <Q>an individual Sub&s;i&s;tence of a rational Being.</Q> A Bea&s;t is an individu|al, but without Rea&s;on, a Soul hath Rea&s;on, but is not an individual; and therefore neither of the&s;e can be a Per&s;on.

of them. An ingenious Writer repre&s;ents a Per&s;on in the Trinity thus. viz. <Q>That it is a &s;piritual infinite Agent, which mu&s;t not be con&s;idered as ab&s;tracted from, but as truly &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the divine Nature, and as mutually, eternally, and in&s;eparably related to the other co-e&s;&s;ential Per&s;ons in the Godhead, from whom he is &s;ufficiently and only di&s;tingui&s;h'd by &s;ome Per&s;onal, and as &s;uch in|communicable Properties.</Q> As this De&s;cription guards again&s;t the Here&s;y of <HI>Sabellius</HI> on the one Hand, who ima|gined a divine Per&s;on to be but a Quality or Accident. So it e|qually militates again&s;t the <HI>Here&s;ie</HI> of the <HI>Trithei&s;ts</HI> who dream that the Per&s;ons of the Trinity are three ab&s;olute Beings that exi&s;t &s;eparately, &amp; thus a Medium is opened, between two dangerous Extreams. It is nece&s;&s;ary to retain the Word <HI>Per|&s;on</HI> re&s;pecting the Trinity, in order to ward off the <HI>Sabelli|an</HI> Error, which is, that the Di&s;tinction among the &s;acred Three is only nominal, and that there is but one Per|&s;on; who becau&s;e of his different Operations, was &s;ome|times called <HI>Father,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>Son,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Holy-Gho&s;t.</HI> Yet in the mean Time, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that there is a wide Difference, between human and divine Per|&s;ons, in the following Re&s;pects, namely</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Human Per&s;ons proceed from each other in Time, but whatever outward Order there be among the &s;acred Three, yet there can be no Fir&s;tne&s;s or Priority of Nature, Time or Dignity among them, they mu&s;t be all co-equal and co-eternal, otherwi&s;e they could not be God.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Human Per&s;ons have their own proper Beings di&s;|tinctly from each other, and from every other Creature, but the Per&s;ons of the Trinity have all one and the &s;ame Being or E&s;&s;ence. The Godhead of the <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Holy-Gho&s;t,</HI> is the very &s;ame, otherwi&s;e there would be three Gods. Tho' one human Per&s;on is of the &s;ame Species with another,
<PB N="432" REF="005500_0435_103966FD05E60E38">
or has a Nature like the re&s;t of his own Order, yet it is not the &s;ame individual Nature which another po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, other|wi&s;e the Faculties and Exerci&s;e thereof would be the very &s;ame in two Per&s;ons, which is certainly fal&s;e. But in re|&s;pect of the Godhead, tho' each Per&s;on be di&s;tinct from the other, yet each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the very &s;ame individual divine Na|ture, otherwi&s;e each could not be &s;aid to be truly and really God.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Human Per&s;ons are &s;eparated from each other, one might be, tho' the other &s;hould never exi&s;t: Created Beings are deriv'd precarious and dependant, whereas on the con|trary, the Per&s;ons of the Trinity have an In-being in one ano|ther, <HI>John</HI> xiv. 10. <HI>Believe&s;t thou not that I am in the Fa|ther, and the Father in me?</HI> And undoubtedly they have a nece&s;&s;ary Exi&s;tence, and independent Per&s;onality, otherwi&s;e each of them could not be infinitely perfect, and &s;o not God.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here beg leave to mention Mr. <HI>Flavels</HI> De&s;cripti|on of a Per&s;on of the Trinity, which I think is as &s;afe and intelligible, as any that I have met with, which is this, viz. <Q>That it is the Godhead di&s;tingui&s;h'd by per&s;onal Pro|perties, each Per&s;on having his di&s;tinct per&s;onal Proper|ties.</Q> (<HI>Heb.</HI> i. 3.) To explain which let the following Particulars be con&s;ider'd. namely</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That all the &s;acred Three po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame Godhead, and hence they are &s;aid to <HI>be One</HI> in our Text; and el&s;e|where, that <HI>they are in each other,</HI> as has been but now mentioned, they have a Communion in the &s;ame E&s;&s;ence: Fora&s;much as the divine E&s;&s;ence is Infinite, it can be com|municated to more than one, and hence they mu&s;t needs have Commuion in the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential Attributes, &s;uch as Omnicience, Almightine&s;s, Eternity, Self-exi&s;tence. What|ever per&s;onal Self-exi&s;tence does peculiarly belong to the
<PB N="433" REF="005500_0436_103966FB84BF9F38">
<HI>Father, (John</HI> v. 26.) Yet an e&s;&s;ential Self-Exi&s;tence, mu&s;t belong to all the &s;acred Three, that is, the Son and Spirit mu&s;t be of them&s;elves, as well as the Father, otherwi&s;e they could not be God, and from this Communion in E&s;|&s;ence and Attributes, nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ults a Communion in re|ligious Wor&s;hip, which equally belongs to all. (<HI>John</HI> v. 23.)</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Godhead is di&s;tingui&s;h'd, not divided, the di|vine E&s;&s;ence being &s;imple and infinite, is therefore indivi&s;i|ble into more of the &s;ame Kind, but tho' it cannot be divided, yet it may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by per&s;onal Proper|ties.</P>
<P>Now the Per&s;onal Property of the Father, <HI>is to beget the Son,</HI> P&s;. ii. 7. <HI>I will declare the Decree, the Lord hath &s;aid unto me, thou art my Son this Day have I begotten thee,</HI> Eph. i. 3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who hath ble&s;&s;ed us with all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, in Heavenly Places in CHRIST.</HI> Begetting is not an E&s;&s;ential Act, otherwi&s;e it would be common to all, but we do not find that it is common to all, the Son is never &s;aid in Scripture to beget the Father, or the Holy Gho&s;t the Son; and therefore the Act is Per&s;onal, on this Account altho' the Father cannot be called properly the Fountain of the Deity, yet he is by &s;ome call'd the Original of the Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>That the Generation of the Son was eternal, is evident from the following Places of Scripture, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> iii. 14, 15. <HI>For this Cau&s;e I bow my Knees unto the Father of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, of whom the whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named,</HI> Prov. viii. 22, 24. <HI>The Lord po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me in the Beginning of his Way, before his Works of Old.

The
<PB N="434" REF="005500_0437_103966F9B2BE7698">
eternal Generation of the Son is confirm'd by the Titles gi|ven to him in Scripture, thus he is call'd ab&s;olutely the <HI>Son of God (Mat.</HI> xvi. 16.) <HI>A Son begotten by God</HI> (Acts iv. 25, 26.) <HI>His own Son.</HI> (Rom. viii. 32.) <HI>The fir&s;t begotten Son.</HI> (Heb. i. vi.) <HI>The only begotten Son</HI> (John i. 14.) This eternal Generation &s;ome Godly and learned Divines &s;ay, "con&s;i&s;ts in the Communication of the &s;ame E&s;&s;ence." <HI>John</HI> v. 26. And others, <Q>in the Communication of Per|&s;onality.</Q> Or in other Words, <Q>That the Per&s;on of the Father, begat the Per&s;on of the Son from Everla&s;t|ing, ineffably, but undividedly.</Q> Altho' it is exceed|ing nece&s;&s;ary inviolably to maintain the eternal Generation of the Son, becau&s;e it is a&s;&s;erted by Scripture and Antiquity, and the Denial of it &s;eems to have a bad Tendency to weak|en our Belief of the Doctrine of the Trinity, by oppo&s;ing the per&s;onal Properties of the Father and Son, which are the principal Ground of the Di&s;tinction between tho&s;e di|vine Per&s;ons. Yet we mu&s;t confe&s;s with <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> and a Cloud of other Witne&s;&s;es, that the Manner thereof is incompre|hen&s;ible, and inexpre&s;&s;ible. And hence the Antient Fa|thers were wont to &s;ay concerning it, <Q>That it was incom|prehen&s;ible, without the Vici&s;&s;itude of Time, without Se|paration, and without Change or Pa&s;&s;ion, either in the Father or Son.</Q> <HI>Prov.</HI> viii. 22, 23. <HI>Mic.</HI> v. 2. <HI>Colo&s;.</HI> i. 17. <HI>John</HI> i. 1. <HI>&amp;</HI> xiv. 10, 11. Which they expre&s;s'd in the fol|lowing Words, <HI>acataleptoos, achronoos, achori&s;toos, apathoos.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Second Per&s;on of the Trinity, is only the Son of God, on the Account of his eternal Generation, altho' his Son&s;hip be manife&s;ted by his Incarnation, <HI>Rom.</HI> i. And hence he is call'd <HI>the Brightne&s;s of his Fathers Glory, and ex|pre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on,</HI> Heb. i. 3. Colo&s;. i. 15. He is &s;ure|ly the Son of the Father, in a Sen&s;e different from any meer Creature in Heaven or Earth, otherwi&s;e he could not
<PB N="435" REF="005500_0438_103966F8089C50B0">
be call'd <HI>the only begotten Son of God, and equal to God.</HI> Phil. ii. 6. And therefore it mu&s;t be by eternal Generation: He had the Character of a Son before he a&s;&s;um'd human Na|ture. (<HI>John</HI> iii. 16.) And therefore that A&s;&s;umption could not be the Cau&s;e of his Son&s;hip, to &s;uppo&s;e that the Incarna|tion of our Lord, is the Cau&s;e of his Son&s;hip, is to de&s;troy the Paternal Relation of the fir&s;t Per&s;on to him: For thus the third Per&s;on might be call'd his Father as well as the Fir&s;t; and as to the &s;eeming Ab&s;urdities that are objected, it may be in general replied, that tho&s;e take Place only in na|tural Generations, not &s;upernatural.</P>
<P>But to proceed, the per&s;onal Property of the Son, is to <HI>be begotten by the Father,</HI> Prov. viii. 24, 25. John i. 14. <HI>We be|held his Glory, the Glory, as of the only begotten of the Father.</HI> Heb. i. 5. <HI>For unto which of the Angels &s;aid he at any Time, thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee.</HI> As <HI>active Ge|neration</HI> is the Manner of the Fathers &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, &s;o <HI>pa&s;&s;ive Generation</HI> is the Manner of the Son's.</P>
<P>Again, the per&s;onal Property of the Holy Gho&s;t is, <HI>to pro|ceed from the Father and the Son,</HI> John xiv. 26. <HI>But the Com|forter which is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will &s;end in my Name, he &s;hall teach you all Things.</HI> And chap. xv. 16. <HI>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will &s;end unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he &s;hall te&s;tify of me.</HI></P>
<P>And thus it appears that the &s;acred Three are di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd by their per&s;onal Properties; and by the Order of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and acting con&s;equent thereupon.</P>
<P>The per&s;onal Properties &s;hew that they are &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd, that one cannot be the other. The Father cannot be the Son, or the Son the Father, <HI>Yet he that hath &s;een the Son, hath &s;een the Father al&s;o.</HI> John xiv. 9. As to the Order of their &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, the Father is the fir&s;t Per&s;on, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ts entirely of him&s;elf, the Son the &s;econd Per&s;on, begotten by
<PB N="436" REF="005500_0439_103966F662DD27D8">
Father, the Spirit is the Third, who proceeds from both the Father and Son. This Order &s;hould not be inverted, tho' in the mean Time we mu&s;t not conceive that there is any real Priority, as to <HI>Nature, Time,</HI> or <HI>Dignity</HI> but of order only, in re&s;pect of their Original. The Father con&s;i|der'd as &s;uch, is fir&s;t in order before his Son, but the Man|ner of the Generation of the Son, and Proce&s;&s;ion of the Ho|ly Gho&s;t, is to us, as has been before ob&s;erv'd, incom|prehen&s;ible! Hence is that of the Prophet, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> liii 8. <HI>Who &s;hall declare his Generation.</HI></P>
<P>Again the Per&s;ons of the Trinity are di&s;tingui&s;h'd, as was before hinted, by their Order of acting, which is agreeable to that of their &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, the Father worketh of him&s;elf, by the Son and Holy Gho&s;t, the Son from the Father, by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit from the Father and Son, by him&s;elf, <HI>John</HI> xvi. 13. <HI>Howheit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth, for he &s;hall not &s;peak of him&s;elf, but what&s;oever he &s;hall hear, that &s;hall he &s;peak.</HI> John v. 19. <HI>Then an&s;wered Je&s;us and &s;aid unto him, verily verily I &s;ay unto you, the Son can do nothing of him&s;elf, but what he &s;eeth the Father do, for what Things &s;oever he doth, the&s;e al&s;o doth he likewi&s;e.</HI> Undoubtedly the Power of working is only one, and therefore common to all the Three, but the Order and Object of working is different; and hence the fir&s;t Work, namely Creation, is a&s;crib'd to the Fir&s;t Per&s;on; and the &s;econd Work, viz. Redemtion to the Second; and the Third Work, namely, Sanctification to the third Per&s;on of the Trinity. This by many Divines is termed the OEconomy of the Per&s;ons of the Godhead; which may be thus de&s;crib'd, viz. <HI>That it is &s;uch an Order of acting, as directly tends to manife&s;t the per&s;onal Glory of the Father Son and Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' all the Works of God, are a&s;crib'd to every Per&s;on of the Trinity, becau&s;e all the divine Attributes equally be|long
<PB N="437" REF="005500_0440_103966F4DF2C02D0">
to them, and therefore every Work mu&s;t be equally produc'd by them. Yet &s;eeing there are di&s;tinct Per&s;ons in the Godhead, it is but rea&s;onable that their per&s;onal Glo|ry &s;hould be peculiarly Manife&s;ted. Now this the &s;acred Scripture Points to, by that different Order of acting, which it a&s;cribes to the &s;acred Three. Hence the Work of our Salvation in re&s;pect of its <HI>Projection,</HI> is fir&s;t a&s;&s;ign'd to the Father, in regard of its <HI>Purcha&s;e</HI> to the Son, and in re&s;pect of its <HI>Application</HI> to the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>It is of the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity that under this Head, we care|fully avoid <HI>Sabelliani&s;m</HI> on the one Hand, which allows of no Di&s;tinction among the Per&s;ons of the Trinity, but what is meerly nominal, and a&s;&s;erts that one and the &s;ame Per&s;on becau&s;e of his different Operations, is &s;ometimes called Father, &s;ometimes Son, and &s;ometimes Holy Spirit, and on the o|ther, that we with equal Care avoid the <HI>Trithei&s;m</HI> of <HI>Valen|tinus,</HI> who deem'd that there were Three eternal Spirits, unequal to each other, and different in E&s;&s;ence, and &s;o by con&s;equence that there were three Gods: Some to avoid the Here&s;y of <HI>Sabellius,</HI> have held that the Per&s;ons of the Trini|ty differ from each other <HI>really,</HI> but that &s;eeming to verge to Trithei&s;m, others to avoid that extream, have held that they only differ <HI>modally,</HI> as one manner from another, but &s;ome thinking that the modal Di&s;tinction, is too &s;uperficial and that it verges to <HI>Sabelliani&s;m</HI> do ob&s;erve, that the Di&s;|tinction is <HI>real-Modal,</HI> this &s;eems to guard be&s;t again&s;t both Extreams. But if tho&s;e &s;chola&s;tick Di&s;tinctions do not &s;atisfy, it will be enough to &s;ay, that the Per&s;ons of the Trinity dif|fer as Three, or that they are &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, by per&s;onal Properties, that the one cannot be the other.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall beg leave to cite the Words of famous Mr. <HI>How,</HI> in his Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Trinity, pag. 540 which run thus, <Q>Since therefore there is a Nece&s;&s;ity apprehend|ed, of acknowledging three &s;uch Somewhats in the God|head,

<P>It may be here added, that the Per&s;ons of the Trinity are di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the E&s;&s;ence, as one from Three, or as that which is communicable from that which is incom|municable. I proceed to the</P>

There the People, after the awful Judgment of the fiery Serpents was &s;ent among them, confe&s;s'd that they had &s;in'd again&s;t the Lord, or <HI>Jehovah.</HI> Now this Pa&s;&s;age we find expre&s;ly apply'd to CHRIST by the Apo&s;tle in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> 1 <HI>Epi&s;t.</HI> x. 9. <HI>Neither let us tempt Chri&s;t as &s;ome of them al&s;o tempted, and were de&s;troyed of the Serpents, I&s;a.</HI> xl. 3. <HI>The Voice of him that cryeth in the Wilderne&s;s, pepare the Way of the Lord, or</HI> Jehovah, <HI>make &s;trait in the De&s;art a high Way for our God.</HI> (See this apply'd to Chri&s;t, <HI>Mat.</HI> iii. 3.11.) Another notable Place of Scripture to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e is, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> vi. 1.2. <HI>Mine Eyes have &s;een the King the Lord, or</HI> Jehovah: This is likewi&s;e apply'd to CHRIST, <HI>Joh.</HI> xii. 40.41. Our Lord likewi&s;e a&s;&s;umes the Name <HI>Jehovah,</HI> as appears by his telling the <HI>Jews</HI> thus, <HI>before</HI> Abraham <HI>was,</HI> I AM; many other Proofs might be brought, but what have been mention'd, if duly con&s;ider'd, may, I hope, &s;uffice. But</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The <HI>Attributes of God</HI> are a&s;crib'd to CHRIST, as particularly,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>Omniciency,</HI> John. xxi. 17. <HI>Lord thou knowe&s;t all Things.</HI> And el&s;ewhere it is &s;aid, that <HI>he knew from the Beginning who they were that believed not, and who &s;hould betray him. John.</HI> vi. 64. and <HI>John</HI> ii. 24.25. It is &s;aid,
<PB N="440" REF="005500_0443_103966F01175A678">
JESUS <HI>did not commit him&s;elf unto them, becau&s;e he knew all Men, and needed not that any &s;hould te&s;tify of Man, for he knew what was in Man.</HI> Be&s;ides, <HI>Rev.</HI> ii. 23. He is &s;aid <HI>to &s;earch the Reins and Heart.</HI> Such Knowledge as this, is &s;urely beyond the Reach of Men and Angels.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>Omnipotency</HI> is a&s;crib'd to CHRIST, <HI>Rev.</HI> i. 8. <HI>I am the</HI> Alpha <HI>and</HI> Omega, <HI>the Beginning and Ending, &s;ayeth the Lord, which is, which was, which is to come, the Al|mighty. Philip.</HI> iii. 21. <HI>Whereby he is able to &s;ubdue all Things to him&s;elf:</HI> And hence he is call'd <HI>the mighty God,</HI> and &s;aid <HI>to uphold all Things by his Power. (I&s;.</HI> xi. 6. <HI>Heb.</HI> i. 3.)</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>Eternity</HI> is a&s;crib'd to CHRIST: And hence he is call'd <HI>the Everla&s;ting Father. (I&s;.</HI> ix. 6.) And &s;aid <HI>to live for ever and ever. (Rev.</HI> x. 6.) And that <HI>his goings forth have been from of Old, from Everla&s;ting. (Mic.</HI> v. 2.)</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>Omnipre&s;ence</HI> is likewi&s;e a&s;crib'd to CHRIST. <HI>Mat.</HI> xviii. 20. <HI>Where two or three are gather'd together in my Name there am I in the mid&s;t of them;</HI> this is a manife&s;t Evidence of the God-head of our Lord; for &s;urely a Creature cannot be in two Places at once. To imagine that the afore&s;aid Place of Scripture intends only the Pre&s;ence of our Lords Authority, is to &s;uppo&s;e a Tautology in the Words which is ab&s;urd; for to be <HI>gather'd together in his Name,</HI> &s;ignifies his Authority: &s;urely it is but rea&s;onable to take this Place of Scripture, in the &s;ame Sen&s;e with that Parallel one, <HI>Exo.</HI> xx. 24. <HI>In all Places where I record my Name, I will come unto thee, and I will ble&s;s thee.</HI> See likewi&s;e Matt. xxviii. ult. <HI>Lo I am with you always unto the End of the World.</HI></P>
<P N="5">(5.) <HI>Independency</HI> is a&s;crib'd to CHRIST. <HI>Rev.</HI> i. 8.17. <HI>I am</HI> Alpha <HI>and</HI> Omega, <HI>the Beginning and Ending &s;ayeth the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come.</HI> In|dependency is likewi&s;e imply'd in the name <HI>Jehovah,</HI> which is given to CHRIST; as has been prov'd before.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="441" REF="005500_0444_103966EE6B3084C0">(6.) <HI>Equality with God</HI> is likewi&s;e a&s;crib'd to Chri&s;t: And hence it is &s;aid, <HI>that he was in the form of God, and thought it no Robery to be equal with God. Philip.</HI> ii. 5.6.7. For this Rea&s;on he is ju&s;tly call'd <HI>the Fellow of God.</HI> Zec. xiii. 7. And all that the Father hath are &s;aid to be his. (<HI>Joh.</HI> xvi. xv.)</P>
<P N="7">(7.) <HI>Immutability in E&s;&s;ence</HI> is a&s;crib'd to our Lord. <HI>P&s;.</HI> cii, 27, 28. <HI>But thou art the &s;ame and thy Years &s;hall have no End, the Children of thy Servants &s;hall continue, and their Seed &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;h'd before thee.</HI> Compar'd with <HI>Heb.</HI> i. 12. <HI>As a Ve&s;ture thou &s;halt fold them up, and they &s;hall be changed, but thou art the &s;ame, and thy Years &s;hall not fail.</HI> And in a Word there is no Attribute belongs to the Father, but what is al&s;o a&s;crib'd to the Son. Again</P>
<P N="3">3dly the <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>God</HI> are a&s;crib'd to CHRIST, particu|larly,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Work of <HI>Creation,</HI> Joh. i. 3. <HI>All Things were made by him, and without him was not any Thing made that was made. Col.</HI> i. 16. <HI>For by him were all Things created that are in Heaven and that are in Earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;i|ble.</HI> Now Creation is certainly a Work which requires Almighty Strength, a Work which none but a God can perform.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Work of <HI>Providence</HI> is attributed to our Lord: And hence it is &s;aid, that <HI>by him all Things con&s;i&s;t, and are upheld by the Word of his Power. (Col.</HI> i. 17. and <HI>Heb.</HI> i. 3.) The&s;e words of our Lord to the <HI>Jews John</HI> v. 17. are applicable to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>Miraculous Works</HI> are a&s;crib'd to CHRIST, <HI>John.</HI> v. 21. <HI>For as the Father rai&s;eth up the Dead, and quickneth them, even &s;o the Son quickneth whom he will.</HI> An In&s;tance of this we have <HI>John</HI> xi. 43, 44. Where we are told that our Lord com|manded
<PB N="442" REF="005500_0445_103966ECC7343148">
<HI>Lazarus to come forth,</HI> after he had been four Days dead, and that this was immediately obey'd, <HI>the dead came forth, bound Hand and Foot, with grave Cloths.</HI> Our Lord likewi&s;e rais'd him&s;elf from the Dead. (<HI>John</HI> x. 18.) Many other In&s;tances might be produc'd, but I mu&s;t not per&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> are in like Manner attributed to the Lord JESUS; &s;uch as,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>Election,</HI> John xiii. 18, <HI>I &s;peak not of you all, I know whom I have cho&s;en.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>Ju&s;tification, I&s;a.</HI> liii. 11. <HI>By his Knowledge &s;hall my righteous Servant ju&s;tify many,</HI> Mat. ix. 6. <HI>But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath Power on Earth to for|give Sins.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>Regeneration,</HI> Ephe&s;. ii. 1. <HI>And you hath be quickned who were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins.</HI> And hence CHRIST is &s;aid <HI>to be the Author and Fini&s;her of Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>Salvation,</HI> Mat. i. 21. <HI>And &s;hall bring forth a Son, and thou &s;halt call his name</HI> JESUS, <HI>for he &s;hall &s;ave his Peo|ple from their Sins.</HI> Hence he is call'd <HI>the Captain of our Salvation;</HI> and we are told that <HI>in his Name alone Happine&s;s is to be had, Act.</HI> iv. 12. To what has been &s;aid under this Head, we may add our Lords <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion of the Holy-Spirit,</HI> and <HI>In&s;titution of &s;acred Ordinances,</HI> Joh. xvi. 7. <HI>If I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart I will &s;end him unto you.</HI> Mat. xxviii. 18.19. <HI>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth. Go therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Fa|ther, Son and Holy-Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. The <HI>Wor&s;hip due to God only</HI> is a&s;crib'd to CHRIST: And hence Men are enjoyned to <HI>honour the Son even as they honour the Father, Joh.</HI> v. 22.23. Particularly</P>
<P N="1">(1.) We are enjoyn'd to <HI>adore</HI> him, Heb. i. 6. <HI>And when he bringeth in the fir&s;t Begotten into the World, he &s;ayeth,
<PB N="443" REF="005500_0446_103966EB17D6FB48">
and let all the Angels of God wor&s;hip him.</HI> (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 12.) Call'd to be Saints with all that in every Place, call up|on the Name of JESUS CHRIST our Lord, both theirs and ours.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) We are bid to <HI>tru&s;t</HI> in him and <HI>obey</HI> him, John xiv. 1. <HI>Let not your Heart be troubled, believe in God, believe al&s;o in me.</HI> Rom. x. 11. <HI>For the Scripture &s;ayeth Who&s;o|ever believeth in him &s;hall not be a&s;ham'd. H&s;.</HI> ii. 12. <HI>Ki&s;s the Son lea&s;t he be Angry, and ye peri&s;h from the Way.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) We are to be <HI>baptis'd</HI> in his Name, as well as in the Name of the Father. <HI>Mat.</HI> xviii. 19.</P>
<P>Again I add, that our Lord did a&s;&s;ert his Godhead in divers Conferrences with the <HI>Jews. (See John</HI> v. 16. to the 19th. Ver&s;e.) The <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ought to &s;lay him, becau&s;e he made him&s;elf equal with God. Now our Lord does not in An&s;wer hereto endeavour to clear him&s;elf of that Charge; which &s;urely he would have done had he not been God, otherwi&s;e he would be Guilty of the greate&s;t Impiety. When the People of <HI>Ly&s;tra</HI> attempted to wor&s;hip <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas, they rent their Cloaths, and ran among them, cry|ing out Sirs, why do ye the&s;e Things? We al&s;o are Men of like Pa&s;&s;ions with you, Act.</HI> xiv. 14.15. But our Saviour in|&s;tead of rejecting the Charge, notwith&s;tanding of &s;ome Pa&s;|&s;ages that re&s;pect his human Nature, a&s;&s;erts his Divinity, by &s;hewing that <HI>he quickned whom he pleas'd, as well as the Father;</HI> likewi&s;e that <HI>all Judgment was committed to him,</HI> and that <HI>all Men &s;hould honour him as they honour the Father;</HI> that <HI>he had Life in him&s;elf, and &s;hould rai&s;e the Dead at the la&s;t Day.</HI> At another Time, <HI>Joh.</HI> viii. 53. to 58. After the <HI>Jews</HI> had enquir'd, <HI>art thou greater than our Father</HI> Abraham?&mdash; He reply'd, <HI>your Father</HI> Abraham <HI>rejoyc'd to &s;ee my Day, and he &s;aw it and was glad. Then &s;aid the</HI> Jews <HI>unto him, thou art not yet fifty Years Old, and ha&s;t
<PB N="444" REF="005500_0447_103966E995A5C750">
thou &s;een</HI> Abraham: To this our Lord an&s;wered, <HI>before</HI> Abraham <HI>was, I</HI> AM! At this Time the <HI>Jews</HI> were enrag'd, and took up Stones to throw at him, &s;uppo&s;ing that he had &s;poken Bla&s;phemy, in preferring him&s;elf to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and making him&s;elf equal to God. It is certain that being &s;ton'd to Death, was a Penalty denounc'd by the judicial Law again&s;t Bla&s;phemers; the afore&s;aid Sentence of our Lord, &s;eems to be Parallel with that of the Prophet, re&s;pecting the the Eternity of God, <HI>viz. I&s;a.</HI> xliii. 13. <HI>Yea before the Day was, I</HI> AM <HI>he.</HI></P>
<P>Another very memorable Conference we have, <HI>Mat.</HI> ix. from the 2d. to the 6th. Ver&s;e. Our Lord declar'd to one &s;ick of the Pal&s;y, that <HI>his Sins were forgiven him;</HI> on which Occa&s;ion the <HI>Scribes</HI> murmured, and charged him with <HI>Bla&s;phemy.</HI> JESUS knowing their Thoughts reply'd, <HI>where|fore think ye Evil in your Hearts? For whether is it ea&s;ier to &s;ay, thy Sins be forgiven thee, or to &s;ay ari&s;e and walk; but that ye may know the Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins, he &s;ayeth to the Per&s;on Sick of the Pal&s;y, take up thy Bed, and go into thine Hou&s;e.</HI> Proving by this Mira|cle his Divinity; which they oppos'd, and con&s;equently his Power to forgive Sins.</P>
<P>Tho' Miracles do not argue the Divinity of the Per&s;on that Works them from any vi&s;ible Circum&s;tance contain'd in them; yet they effectualy prove it, in Ca&s;e this be the Thing conte&s;ted, and an explicite Appeal be made to the divine Power to confirm it by Miracles.</P>
<P>Our Lord had at the afore&s;aid Conference as good an Opportunity, and as loud a Call as could be de&s;ir'd to di&s;|claim all Pretence to Divinity, if the Ca&s;e was really &s;o; but in&s;tead of this he a&s;&s;erts and proves his Godhead, maugre the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rage, which Practice could not con&s;i&s;t with Integrity if he were not God.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="005500_0448_1039640D3805CFE8">And now I &s;hall proceed to offer a few practical Reflec|tions, and &s;o conclude at pre&s;ent. And 1&s;t. What has been &s;aid informs us of the following Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. Of the true <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of wor&s;hiping God, and that is in the Son and by the Spirit, Joh. xvi. 23. <HI>What&s;oever ye &s;hall a&s;k the Father in my Name, he will give it you. Ephe&s;.</HI> vi. 18. <HI>Praying allways with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit.</HI> Surely it is by the Son, we &s;hould come to the Father in our Supplications, and hence CHRIST is call'd <HI>the Way, John</HI> xix. 6. And we are &s;aid to <HI>have Boldne&s;s to enter into the Holie&s;t by the Blood of</HI> JESUS <HI>by a new or liv|ing Way, which he hath con&s;ecrated for us, that is to &s;ay his Fle&s;h, Heb.</HI> x. 19, 20. Tho&s;e are therefore to be &s;u&s;pected as Guilty of the Here&s;y of <HI>Sabellius,</HI> who do not according to the Scriptures, ordinarily come to the Father by the Son in their Prayers, but u&s;ually addre&s;s the Son, as tho' he were the Father, and do not give to each of the &s;acred Three, their di&s;tinct per&s;onal Glory in their Acts of Devo|tion; but &s;o frequently addre&s;s the Son, as if there were no other Per&s;on but he in the Trinity.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, How <HI>Happy</HI> is the <HI>State</HI> of all regenerate Per&s;ons who have this three&mdash;one <HI>God,</HI> in all his Glory and Ex|cellency for their &s;ure Portion here, (<HI>Jer.</HI> xxxi. 33.) and &s;hall be continually delighted, with beholding the di&s;tinct Benefits receiv'd from each of the &s;acred Three hereafter. <HI>Rev.</HI> i. 5. <HI>And from</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>the Faithful Witne&s;s unto him that lov'd us, and wa&s;hed us from our Sins in his Blood.</HI> And does it not increa&s;e their Felicity, that the Charter of the Holy Scripture, by which the afore&s;aid Por|tion is made over, is confirm'd by the united Te&s;timony of the &s;acred Trinity from Heaven, as our Text informs us, <HI>There are Three that bear record in Heaven, and the&s;e Three are One.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="446" REF="005500_0449_103966E7D4674828">3dly. How much &s;hould our <HI>Souls be affected</HI> by thinking on the Fathers Love, in giving his Son to be a Propitiation for our Sins. Herein is Love, indeed without Peer or Para|lel, (<HI>John</HI> iv. 10.) in that a Son was given for worthle&s;s Rebels, to Shame, Mi&s;ery and Death it &s;elf, of the mo&s;t hideous Kind! A Son not by Creation as the Angels, nor by Adoption as Believers, but by eternal Generation. His <HI>own, beloved, dear, only begotten Son, in whom he was well pleas'd. (Rom.</HI> viii. 32. <HI>Mat.</HI> iii. 17. <HI>Col.</HI> i. 13. <HI>Joh.</HI> i. 14.18.) And that to prevent the eternal Peri&s;hing of poor Sin|ners. (<HI>Joh.</HI> iii. 16.)</P>
<P>And what &s;hall we &s;ay of the Kindne&s;s of the Son of God, in &s;tooping &s;o low to &s;ave guilty Worms from eternal Woe and Ruin; tho' he had the Form of God, yet he willingly a&s;&s;um'd the Form of a Servant, that we might be made the Sons of God. He that had the Heavens for his Throne, was contented with a Manger for his Cradle; tho' he was Rich he became Poor, that we thro' his Poverty might be made Rich; was crown'd with Thorns; endur'd the Death of the Cro&s;s, and was laid in the Bo&s;om of the Grave; that we might be crown'd with immortal Glory, deliver'd from the &s;econd Death, and embrac'd in the Bo&s;om of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the Bo&s;om of God.</P>
<P>And how much &s;hould we be affected, likewi&s;e with the Kindne&s;s of the Holy Spirit in enlightning our Minds, re|newing and comforting our Hearts by his divine Influences, without which we could have no &s;pecial Benefit by the Death of CHRIST, no Communion with God here; or En|joyment of him in a future World.</P>
<P>But to proceed, me thinks the Con&s;ideration of the Divi|nity of the Son of God, is one of the mo&s;t pregnant and powerful Incentives po&s;&s;ible to Admiration, Love, Humili|ty, and Obedience: How &s;ublime the Theme? How &s;ur|prizing
<PB N="447" REF="005500_0450_103966E650532F18">
the Thought that the eternal Father &s;hould give his co-equal Son, the darling of his Soul, out of the Em|braces of his Bo&s;om, to bleed a Victom on the accur&s;ed Tree, to purcha&s;e Peace, Pardon and Life for worthle&s;s Re|bels! O the amazing Heights, the interminable Depths of this &s;tupenduous dear Affection! This is Love infinitely &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing the narrow Bounds of human Thought or Language. Love that none but a God is equal to! And how Strange, is it that the ble&s;&s;ed God &s;hould become incarnate, the Antient of Days become an Infant of Time, the Maje&s;ty of Heaven &s;toop to a&s;&s;ume the Infirmities of Humanity! O my Brethren! did not re&s;t him&s;elf become weary to give the weary Re&s;t? And the Fountain of Con&s;olation <HI>become a Man of Sorrows,</HI> to bring his People to uncea&s;ing Joys and Triumphs!</P>
<P>When we contemplate upon the Dignity of the Per&s;on of the Son of God, together with the Depth and De&s;ign of his Aba&s;ure, what can more powerfully con&s;train us to Humility and Affection, both to God and Man! For therein we may behold the great God de&s;ending from his Throne, to teach us tho&s;e amiable Vertues by his own Ex|ample, as well as the Excellency of univer&s;al Obedience to the divine Law. The Godhead of CHRIST beautifies all the In&s;tances of his Aba&s;ure with the mo&s;t tran&s;cendant Charms, unrivald Ornaments, and amiable Atractives! This is the Object of our Adoration and religion Reve|rence; this fires our Affections, and is the Foundation of our Hopes; this, this &s;trikes the Springs of our Ingenuity and Gratitude, and rai&s;es our admiring Thoughts into Ex|ta&s;y and Ravi&s;hment! While we with Attention view the inutterable, unparallel'd, and incomprehen&s;ible Prodi|gy of divine Affection in the Mediation of the Son of God! But if with the <HI>Socinians</HI> and <HI>Arians</HI> we deny his proper
<PB N="448" REF="005500_0451_103966E4A9BED038">
Deity, our Admiration cea&s;es, our Love Langui&s;hes, and our Devotion dies for the Gift of a meer Creature: And his Sufferings are incon&s;iderable Things, not worthy to be once mention'd, in Compari&s;on of the Gift, and Conde|&s;cention of a God! The Object of our Wor&s;hip is removed; the Ground of our Hopes unhing'd, and the whole Scene of the Go&s;pel de&s;troy'd at a Stroke. Dreadful Thought!</P>
<P>Let us therefore be entreated equally to love, honour, and obey each Per&s;on of the &s;acred Trinity. Let <HI>all Men honour the Son, as they honour the Father, John</HI> v. 23. Our Lord as Man obey'd his Father, and how much more &s;hould we. (<HI>Joh.</HI> iv. 34.) Let us al&s;o <HI>ki&s;s the Son lea&s;t he be Angry, and we peri&s;h from the Way; and &s;eeing the Spirit of God hath made us. Job.</HI> xxxiii. 4. Why &s;hould not he be ador'd by us.</P>
<P>But the Time being elaps'd I mu&s;t conclude, in the mean while a&s;cribing all Glory to the Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinitiy; the Three in One, and One in Three; the Father, Word and Spirit, let Men and Angels &s;ay <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>THE Doctrine of the ever ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, is purely an Object of Faith.

This I think the learned Mr. <HI>How,</HI> has made evident in his Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Trinity in the Godhead. In my la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Doctrine of the Trinity, you may remember that I propos'd the follow|ing Method, viz.

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The Manner of the Spirits interceeding, is re|pre&s;ented in the preceeding Ver&s;e which is this, <HI>He &s;tirs up

in God's People by his efficiency, Groanings that cannot be ut|tered.</HI> The Words <HI>cata, theon,</HI> or according to God, &s;eem only to import, that the Spirit helps pious People to pray as it becomes, or in that Manner God requires. Here is no Difference a&s;&s;erted between Gods Will and his, in which the Force of the Objection lies.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 6. <Q><HI>It is &s;aid of the Holy-Spirit,</HI> John. <HI>xvi. 13.14.</HI> That he &s;hall not &s;peak of him&s;elf, but what&s;oever he &s;hall hear, that &s;hall he &s;peak.&mdash;For he &s;hall receive of mine, and &s;hew it unto you.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The afore&s;aid Text does not argue that the Spi|rit has all the Ideas of Things impre&s;s'd on his Mind, which he communicates, as Creatures have; for this would contradict what is el&s;ewhere &s;aid concerning him, <HI>viz. That he knoweth the deep Things of God:</HI> But probably it in|tends this, that the Holy Spirit would communicate no other Doctrines, than what Chri&s;t had before reveal'd in the Go&s;pel; be&s;ides the afore&s;aid Phra&s;es &s;eem to &s;ignify that the Order of the Holy-Spirits acting, is agreeable to the Order of his &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, namely, that as he proceeds from the Father and the Son, &s;o he acts from them, but without any Imperfection or Dependance in re&s;pect of his E&s;&s;ence, Exi&s;tence, or Action.</P>
<P>But I may add, that it is objected again&s;t the Doctrine of the Trinity in general, namely, <Q>That it is contra|ry to Rea&s;on, and therefore ought not to be believ'd.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> That it is above Rea&s;on we confe&s;s, but that it is contrary to it we deny. Now a Doctrine may be truly &s;aid, to be contrary to Rea&s;on, when it contradicts &s;ome of the fir&s;t Principles of rea&s;oning, which are &s;elf Evident, and univer&s;ally acknowledged, &s;uch as that a Thing can be, and not be at the &s;ame Time, that the whole is greater than a Part, &amp;c. A Doctrine cannot be truly call'd Unrea&s;onable,
<PB N="461" REF="005500_0464_103966CECCF1A8E0">
meerly becau&s;e it oppo&s;es unju&s;t Deductions from fir&s;t Principles; but we know not that the Article of the Tri|nity contradicts any of tho&s;e fir&s;t Principles before men|tioned, or others Parallel to them.</P>
<P>It is alledg'd that this is an In&s;tance of Contradicti|on which &s;ome &s;ugge&s;t, namely, <Q><HI>That while we a&s;&s;ert that</HI> there is but one God; <HI>in the mean Time we &s;ay, that</HI> there are three Per&s;ons in the Godhead, and that each of the&s;e is God.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> But herein there is no Contradiction, becau&s;e we &s;ay not that the &s;acred Three are di&s;tinct Gods; the Di&s;tinction re&s;pects their Per&s;onality, and not their God|head: And when we &s;ay there are three Almighties we mean not that the&s;e Perfections are di&s;tinct, but the very &s;ame in them all. Neither is the Con&s;equence valid from human to divine Per&s;onality, <HI>i. e.</HI> becau&s;e human Per&s;ons are di&s;tinct Beings, that therefore the Divine mu&s;t be &s;o. If indeed the divine Per&s;onality were finite, like that of the Creature, then it might be rea&s;onably requir'd that a finite Mind &s;hould account for it; but &s;ince it is not &s;o, it mu&s;t therefore be incomprehen&s;ible, and thus our not being able to Gra&s;p it &s;hould be no Bar to our Belief of it. Surely &s;eeing Almighty God knows be&s;t the Manner of his own Exi&s;tence, it is but rea&s;onable we &s;hould believe the Account which he has given of it, in that Revelation which bears the Characters of a divine Original.</P>
<P>But I proceed to the Improvement of this Subject. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t What has been &s;aid &s;erves to inform us, of the un|happy Ca&s;e of all <HI>Antitrinitarians,</HI> whether <HI>Jews, Turks, Arians,</HI> or <HI>Socinians,</HI> when our Lord had prov'd his co|equality with his Father, (<HI>John</HI> v.) by &s;hewing that he was one with him, and did the &s;ame Works. He there|fore
<PB N="462" REF="005500_0465_103966CD233496A8">
ju&s;tly infers, that <HI>he that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father. See</HI> v. 23. The &s;ame Truth is el&s;ewhere a&s;&s;er|ted. (1 <HI>Joh.</HI> ii. 23.) Hence <HI>Paul</HI> concludes the <HI>Gentiles</HI> who were without CHRIST to be <HI>Athei&s;ts. (Ephe&s;.</HI> ii. 12.) And is not he an <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> who denys religious Wor&s;hip to him who is the true God. (<HI>Rom.</HI> i. 21.) And on the other Hand is he not an Idolater who offers religious Wor&s;hip to one whom he believes not to be God. What Hope can we have of the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, without Satisfaction be made for Sin, equal to its Demerit, which mu&s;t be Infinite; becau&s;e Sin is objectively &s;o, being committed again&s;t a Being of infinite Perfection? Now is it not utterly impo&s;|&s;ible for a meer Creature, who is nece&s;&s;arily finite, to per|form this infinite Ta&s;k. To &s;uppo&s;e Sin may be pardon'd without equal Satisfaction, is to confront the rectoral Ju&s;tice of God as well as his Truth, which &s;tands engag'd to i&s;&s;ue the Threats of the fir&s;t Covenant upon the Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors thereof, either upon them&s;elves per&s;onally, or up|on a Surety in their Room and Place: And without Par|don what can en&s;ue but utter and irreparable Ruin? And what Ground have we to expect the Regeneration of Men who are dead in Sins and Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, without the Intervention of the Almighty Energy of the Holy-Spirit? And can this be exerted by one who is not God? And pray what is Religion without well grounded Hopes of the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, and Regeneration, but Pre&s;umption, Formality, and De&s;peration? From all which it evidently appears, that the denial of the Godhead of the Son and Holy-Spirit, as well as of the Father, &s;aps the very Founda|tions of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and exceedingly endangers the Salvation of Mens Souls.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Vincent</HI> in his judicious Explanation, of <HI>The A&s;&s;em|blies &s;horter Catechi&s;m,</HI> pag. 33. in an&s;wer to this Que&s;tion,
<PB N="463" REF="005500_0466_103966CB85B4D4A8">
namely, <HI>What &s;hould we judge of them that deny that there are three di&s;tinct Per&s;ons in the Godhead?</HI> Sayeth,</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> <Q>We ought to judge them to be Bla&s;phemers, becau&s;e they &s;peak again&s;t the ever glorious God, who hath &s;et &s;orth him&s;elf, in this Di&s;tinction in the Holy Scriptures. 2dly. To be damnable Hereticks! This Doctrine of the Di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons, in the Unity of E&s;&s;ence being a fundamental Truth denied of old by the <HI>Sabellians, Arians, Photinians,</HI> and of late by the <HI>So|cinians,</HI> who were again&s;t the Godhead of Chri&s;t the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, among&s;t whom the <HI>Quakers</HI> are al&s;o to be numbred, who deny this Di&s;tinction.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Doctrine of the Trinity &s;hews the Sufficiency of the Almighty to &s;ecure the Happine&s;s of fallen Crea|tures, while each Per&s;on a&s;&s;umes his peculiar Task to this End. The Fir&s;t <HI>decrees</HI> it, the Second <HI>purcha&s;es</HI> it, and the Third <HI>applys</HI> and confers it. It is true indeed that every &s;aving Benefit we receive, is common to all the &s;acred Three, and therefore we find the &s;ame Benefits expre&s;&s;ly a&s;crib'd to them all complexly, and to each re&s;pectively, (<HI>Rev.</HI> i. 4.5. <HI>John</HI> vi. 45. <HI>Mat.</HI> xxiii. 10. <HI>John</HI> xiv. 26.) Every Benefit belongs to each Per&s;on of the &s;acred Trinity, after his own peculiar Manner, namely, to the Father by <HI>Original Authority,</HI> and hence they are a&s;&s;ign'd to his good Plea&s;ure, (<HI>Mat.</HI> xi. 25, 26.) To the Son they belong of <HI>Right</HI> and of <HI>Merit,</HI> ina&s;much as he has purcha&s;ed them by his Blood, <HI>that of his Fulne&s;s we might receive Grace for Grace,</HI> (John i. 16.) To the Holy Gho&s;t they belong, by the <HI>imme|diate Efficacy</HI> of <HI>Application.</HI> Rom. viii. 11.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Doctrine of the Trinity &s;hould invite us to the following Duties, namely,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. To endeavour after a di&s;tinct <HI>Knowledge</HI> of this important Point, without which we cannot wor&s;hip God
<PB N="464" REF="005500_0467_103966C9DD38D5C0">
aright. Religious Wor&s;hip is certainly due to all the &s;acred Three, as appears from what has been already &s;aid before, and unle&s;s we know this, how can we perform it, and how can we expect <HI>Fellow&s;hip with the Father, and with the Son</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and the Communion of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> (1 John i. 3. 1 Cor. xiii.) except we know that there be &s;uch Per&s;ons? What can be of more Moment to us, than to be &s;trengthned in our Per&s;ua&s;ion of the divine Original of the Holy Scriptures? And to this End is not our Knowledge of <HI>the Three that bear Record in Heaven</HI> peculiarly &s;ervice|able? <HI>Surely to know the only true God and</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>whom he hath &s;ent is Life eternal</HI> John xviii. 3. <HI>And if any Man have not the Spirit of CHRIST, he is none of his,</HI> Rom. viii. 9.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. We &s;hould glorify the &s;acred Trinity in Imitation of the &s;eraphick Doxology, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> vi. 3. <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the Heavens and Earth are full of the Maje&s;ty of his Glory.</HI> Becau&s;e therein &s;hines forth the un|&s;peakable Happine&s;s of the &s;upream Being, apparent in the endear'd Fellow&s;hip, mutual Knowledge and Complacence of the &s;acred Three, (<HI>Prov.</HI> viii. 30. <HI>Mat.</HI> iii. 17.) There|in is likewi&s;e con&s;picuous the infinite Perfection of Jeho|vah: For thus the Attributes of Three Per&s;ons unite in one E&s;&s;ence common to all, and are we not hereby taught, how the Father, Son and Spirit do mutually glorify each other, (<HI>John</HI> xvii. 4, 5, 22.)</P>
<P>But the Con&s;ideration of the Part which each Per&s;on of the &s;acred Trinity performs in compa&s;&s;ing of our Salvation, &s;hould e&s;pecially invite our grateful Ho&s;anna's, together with that of the divine Goodne&s;s in revealing this My&s;tery to us, which has been hid from Ages. (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> vii. 10.)</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Let us &s;eek with all earne&s;tne&s;s, Communion with the &s;acred Trinity, &s;eeing that this is an attainable and
<PB N="464" REF="005500_0468_103966C766EFFCB0">
mo&s;t important Priviledge, (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 4.) in this is our chief Excellency, our greate&s;t Happine&s;s and Security. (1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 2.) And hence the Prie&s;t of old was requir'd to ble&s;s the People, after the Trinity was di&s;tinctly mentioned, (<HI>Num.</HI> vi. 23, 24, 25.) No Comfort on Earth is equal to that of Fellow&s;hip with the Father, Son, and Spirit. Now to ob|tain this Communion, we mu&s;t for&s;ake Sin, which alienates us from God, and by a living Faith accept the Redeem|er, that being thereby united to him, we may thro' him ob|tain Communion with the Father, and Holy Spirit. <HI>He will pray the Father for us, and he will give us another Comfort|er, that he may abide with us forever, even the Spirit of Truth.</HI> (John xiv. 16, 17.) And having obtain'd Communion let us perform.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The Offices we owe to the &s;acred Trinity, &s;uch as <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> being baptiz'd in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, let us keep our Cove|nant Engagements. We &s;hould expect every &s;alutary Ble&s;&s;ing from all the Per&s;ons of the Trinity, &s;eeing they all by Council and Office, equally con&s;pire to promote our Hap|pine&s;s. (<HI>Num.</HI> vi. 24, 27.) Having ob&s;erv'd the Order of con|ferring every Benefit, which is from the Father by the Son &amp; Spirit. (<HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> ii. 18.) In the mean Time we &s;hould ask the Benefit peculiar to each Per&s;on, according to the divine OEconomy, particularly of him, namely, <HI>Love</HI> from the <HI>Father, Grace</HI> from the <HI>Son,</HI> and <HI>Communion</HI> from the <HI>Spirit.</HI> And on the other Hand, let us faithfully render that oecono|mical Duty we owe to each Per&s;on, namely, to the <HI>Father Reverence,</HI> to the <HI>Son Faith</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and to the <HI>Holy Spirit, Obedience.</HI> And in all our Prayers and Prai&s;es, let us after the Example of the primitive Church make di&s;tinct mention of all the Per&s;ons of the Trinity; that &s;o their per|&s;onal Glory may be &s;uitably manife&s;ted by us.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="005500_0469_103966C5C7415C60">Finally that ble&s;&s;ed Unity and Love, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among the &s;acred Three, invite our Imitation, <HI>let us therefoe keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</HI> becau&s;e hereby we &s;hall in our Mea&s;ure, in &s;ome Sort re&s;emble the &s;acred Trinity. <HI>John</HI> xvii. 21. <HI>That they all may be One, as thou Fa|ther art in me and I in thee;</HI> in this our greate&s;t Glory con|&s;i&s;ts, <HI>John</HI> xvii. <HI>And the Glory which thou gave&s;t me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are.</HI> With|out Endeavours after Union to, and loving Communion with &s;uch whom, from their Principles and Practice, we have Rea&s;on to think are the Saints of God, how can we expect Communion with the &s;acred Trinity, or to be one in them. In a Word, the Beauty, Strength, Increa&s;e and Comfort of religious Societies, depend upon their <HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> here|by they evidence to the World that they <HI>are Di&s;ciples of CHRIST indeed,</HI> let us be therefore Followers of God as dear Children, and walk in Love, as CHRIST al&s;o hath lo|ved us, and given him&s;elf for us, an Offering and a Sacri|fice to God of a &s;weet &s;melling Savour. Now to God the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, the &s;acred and venerable Three One, who bear Witne&s;s from Heaven, to the divine Original of that Religion we profe&s;s, be all Glory a&s;crib'd by Men and Angels, throughout all Eternity. <HI>Amen</HI> and <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
