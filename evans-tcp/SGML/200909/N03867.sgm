<P><HI>There are</HI> GREAT INCONVENIENCIES <HI>at|tending on this A&s;&s;ertion, That none but the Re|generate have a Right to partake of the Lord's Supper.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall briefly mention &s;ome of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Very few can, on this Suppo&s;ition, &s;atisfy them&s;elves, whether they may lawfully par|take of the Lord's Supper, or not: And &s;o ma|ny would, on this Principle, be unavoidably ex|po&s;ed to very great Perplexities with Re&s;pect to this Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether they may and ought to de&s;ire an Admi&s;&s;ion to the Lord's Table, or no?</HI> Such as are &s;erious would fain act in this Mat|ter as they ought to do.

the&s;e Things with a <HI>gracious Sincerity</HI> or not. There is &s;uch a Re&s;emblance betwixt <HI>common</HI> and <HI>&s;aving</HI> GRACE, that they know not whe|ther they have the latter of the&s;e two, or no; and &s;o know not what to do. It is not very likely that God &s;hould have made the Terms of Communion in his vi&s;ible Church, &s;uch as nece&s;&s;arily do involve &s;erious Profe&s;&s;ors of Re|ligion in &s;uch Difficulties as the&s;e, as I have ob|&s;erved in my fir&s;t Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Principle which I argue again&s;t, &s;eems to me to expo&s;e <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> to very <HI>great Difficulties,</HI> re&s;pecting tho&s;e they &s;hould admit to the Ordinance of the Lord's Supper: For if none have any Right to the Lord's Supper, but &s;uch as are in a State of Grace, but will, if they partake of it, eat and drink Judgment to them&s;elves, it &s;eems to me, that they have a very difficult Task, who are obliged to judge whether &s;uch as offer them|&s;elves to their Communion are qualified for it, or not; and a Mi&s;take in this Point may be of dangerous Con&s;equence to the Per&s;ons admit|ted, or denied; e&s;pecially their Admi&s;&s;ion, if they are unfit, will be very dangerous.</P>

Grounds for Charity will admit of a great many Degrees: And it may be enquired, Whether tho&s;e that are to judge of Men's &s;piritual State, according to this Rule, are to give their Sentence accor|ding

<P N="3">3. It is to be feared, that on the Hypothe&s;is oppo&s;ed, many may be <HI>hindred</HI> from Commu|nion in &s;pecial Ordinances, who have a <HI>good Right</HI> to them; and others <HI>admitted</HI> that have <HI>none.</HI> People being fixed in this Principle, That none but the Regenerate have a Right to &s;pecial Ordinances many, even of tho&s;e, who are very &s;eriou&s;ly concerned that they may approve them&s;elves to God, being in great Doubt of the Sincerity of their own Hearts, are in all Likelihood hereby kept back from offering them&s;elves to join in Church Commu|nion. It is evident, that the more &s;erious Per|&s;ons be, the greater Sen&s;e they have of the De|ceitfulne&s;s and de&s;perate Wickedne&s;s of their own Hearts, by Nature; and &s;uch as the&s;e are very apt to be proportionably doubtful of their own Sincerity. The&s;e feel and ob&s;erve &s;o much Corruption working in them, that they cannot ea&s;ily per&s;wade them&s;elves of the In|tegrity of their own Souls, and &s;o dare not ven|ture, in a long Time, if ever, to join them&s;elves to the Church of Chri&s;t; and &s;o <HI>the Church</HI> is hindred from having many Members, who are indeed, fit Matter for it, and <HI>&s;uch &s;erious Souls,</HI> from the Advantages and Comforts, which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ght otherwi&s;e enjoy.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="004754_0029_100DE7A695AF5888">On the other Hand, Per&s;ons far le&s;s religious and comparatively but little concerned for the Glory of God and the Salvation of their own Souls, and who think the Difficulties of Reli|gion are nothing &s;o great as others think them to be, can ea&s;ily per&s;wade them&s;elves that they are true Chri&s;tians, and are pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life; being, as they think, born again. Such as the&s;e can, therefore, without any great Difficulty, offer them&s;elves to the Communion of the Church; and thus great Numbers pro|bably do while, on their own Principles, they are unqualified for it; and by this Means Churches are corrupted rather than kept pure and holy.</P>
<P N="4">4 I would ask this Que&s;tion; Is there not &s;ome Danger, That, on the Principle I oppo&s;e, Per&s;ons &s;ubmitting them&s;elves to Examination, with Re&s;pect to the State of their Souls, in or|der to their Admi&s;&s;ion to the Sacrament, may be very greatly hurt, either by having too fa|vourable a Judgment pa&s;&s;ed on their Condition: or otherwi&s;e too &s;evere a Sentence or Cen&s;ure, with Re&s;pect to it?

here, if &s;uch a Mi&s;take be committed, may greatly hurt the Per&s;on concerned in the Sentence, about who&s;e E&s;tate it is given.
