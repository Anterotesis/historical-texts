<P>THE open Contempt that is put upon revealed Religion by &s;ome, while they prefer Mans corrupt rea&s;on before it, and advance the Oracles of Rea|&s;on, as they call them, above the Oracles of GOD, as a more Infallible rule of Humane Practice; makes it the nece&s;&s;ary duty of all that have a due regard to the Honour of GOD, and the Credit of our holy Religion, that they evidence, upon all occa&s;ions, a high and honourable e&s;teem of the holy Scrip|tures.</P>

AND we cannot better, I am per&s;waded, Manife&s;t the great value we put upon tho&s;e Sacred Records, than by our thankfulne&s;s for them, our earne&s;t endeavours to acquaint our &s;elves with them, by the diligent Im|provement of all Means that GOD hath ap|pointed in order there-unto, and particular|ly by a frequent, reverent and attentive Reading &amp; Hearing of them Read; both in Publick and Private; and by regulating our Faith and Practice by them, as the Infallible Rule of both.</P>
<P>THE Publick Reading of the holy Scrip|tures hath been, I think, the general Practice of the <HI>Catholick Church,</HI> not only under the <HI>Law,</HI> but under the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> al&s;o, from the days of CHRIST, and His Apo&s;tles, to our Times; and why this Practice &s;hould be di&s;continued by any of the Di&s;ciples of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, I &s;ee no rea&s;on: I am per|&s;waded it cannot be alleged to be any part of our Reformation from <HI>Popi&s;h Super&s;tition.</HI></P>
<P>IF the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall, thro' the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD upon it, be made a Mean to &s;tir up any of better parts, and greater abilities, to Examine this Matter Impartially,

<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible that the performance is mean, and bears no ju&s;t proportion to the dignity of the Subject, therein handled; and all the Apology I &s;hall make for it is, That when I &s;tudied the Sermon, I had no thoughts that ever it &s;hould be made more Publick, than the Preaching of it in a &s;mall Congre|gation, &s;hould make it. But after I had de|livered it in Publick, a Friend of mine de|&s;ired the peru&s;ing of my Notes, which I made no difficulty to grant him; and he &s;hewed them to others, and &s;ome of tho&s;e, who&s;e judgment I highly value and e&s;teem, being of Opinion that the making the Di&s;|cour&s;e Publick may be of &s;ome u&s;e: I have &s;ubmitted to their judgment, tho' I know it mu&s;t appear under &s;ome di&s;advantages.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>DEUTERONOMY XXXI. II.</BIBL>
<P><HI>When all I&s;rael is come to appear before the LORD thy GOD, in the place which he &s;hall chu&s;e; thou &s;halt read this law before all I&s;rael, in their hearing.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEY that believe that there is a GOD; mu&s;t acknowledge that He is to be wor&s;hipped by His Rea&s;onable Intelligent Creatures.</P>
<P>THE Notion we have of the glorious GOD, as the <HI>fir&s;t Cau&s;e</HI> of all things; nece&s;|&s;arily leads us to Conceive of Him, as the
<PB N="2" REF="002122_0007_0FBC202434752360"><HI>Chief Good;</HI> and that every thing in the Creatures, that doth any way contribute to their Safety, Comfort, or U&s;efulne&s;s; mu&s;t be derived from Him.</P>
<P>AND the Idea we have of GOD as a Be|ing Infinitely and Tran&s;cendently Excellent in Him&s;elf; and Independent upon all other Beings; and that all His Creatures do intire|ly depend upon Him, in their Beings and Operations; leads us to Conceive of Him, as the Supreme Governour of the World, and that all His rea&s;onable Creatures &s;tand obli|ged to offer up to Him, &s;uch Service as is agreeable to His own Nature, and to the Ca|pacity that He has given them.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e Con&s;iderations of GOD, it naturally follows, that it belongs unto Him only to give Rules and Directions how He will be wor&s;hipped by His Creatures: and that all ways of wor&s;hip, that are not agree|able to the Rules and Directions which He hath given concerning it; mu&s;t be <HI>di&s;plea|&s;ing</HI> to Him, and <HI>unprofitable</HI> to our &s;elves.</P>
<P>AND I think, that Prote&s;tants are gene|rally agreed in this, that the Holy Scriptures contain the Revelations of GOD's Will con|cerning His own Wor&s;hip, both as to the Mat|ter and Manner of it: and therefore when any Que&s;tion ari&s;es among them, relating to
<PB N="3" REF="002122_0008_0FBC2025AE33AAD0">the Wor&s;hip of GOD; they mu&s;t have re|cour&s;e to the Revealed Will of GOD, con|tained in the holy Scriptures, for the Re&s;o|lution of it; as that alone, which may be &s;afely depended upon.</P>
<P>THE Wor&s;hip that the LORD requires of His People, is either <HI>Internal,</HI> or <HI>External,</HI> an&s;werable to the two principal parts where|of Man Con&s;i&s;ts, <HI>viz. Soul</HI> and <HI>Body.</HI> Internal religious Wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts in the Soul's being rightly affected towards GOD the object of divine Wor&s;hip. When the mind is Inlight|ned with Supernatural Knowledge whereby we are inabled to conceive of GOD, accor|ding to the di&s;coveries He hath given of Him|&s;elf; and when He is feared, &amp; loved above all; when He is &s;ubmitted unto <HI>in all things,</HI> tru&s;ted unto, and depended upon <HI>at all times;</HI> and when we entertain a deep and abiding &s;en&s;e of His Goodne&s;s, in His dealings to|wards our &s;elves, and others. <HI>External</HI> re|ligious Wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch words, actions, ge&s;tures, duties and performances as &s;erve to &s;ignifie and declare the <HI>Inward</HI> &s;ub|jection of our Soul to GOD; and our being &s;uitably affected towards Him; and that con|tribute to our entertaining becoming Con|ceptions of Him, and to promote and increa&s;e our E&s;teem of Him, and &s;ubjection to Him.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002122_0009_0FBC20271DABFA50">
THE External Wor&s;hip due to GOD by Man, is either <HI>Private</HI> or <HI>Publick.</HI> Private, is that religious Wor&s;hip which the LORD'S People offer up to GOD Privately, either in their Families, or by them&s;elves alone. Publick, is that religious Wor&s;hip that the LORD's People offer to GOD Publickly, whereby they do Publickly and Solemnly declare their &s;ubjection to GOD, and depen|dance on Him.</P>
<P>IN the words we have now read, we have one of tho&s;e pieces of <HI>External</HI> religious wor|&s;hip which GOD requires His People to offer up to Him, in their Publick A&s;&s;emblies; <HI>viz. The Reading of the Holy Scriptures;</HI> and all ranks of Per&s;ons are Commanded to hearken thereunto, Men, Women, Children, and Strangers; all mu&s;t reverently attend upon this part of Divine Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE Doctrine that falls under our pre|&s;ent Con&s;ideration, is,</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>THAT the Reading of the Holy Scriptures, and the bearing of them Read, is a part of that Wor&s;hip which GOD requires of His People, in their Publick Religious A&s;&s;emblies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002122_0010_0FBC202BFA52FC08">
IN pro&s;ecuting this Doctrine, I &s;hall ob|&s;erve the following Method:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how that the Reading of the Holy Scriptures, and the hearing of them read, is a part of GOD's Publick Wor&s;hip.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) I &s;hall give &s;ome account how this part of GOD's Wor&s;hip &s;hould be performed by His People.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3) I &s;hall draw &s;ome Practical Inferences from the whole.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>AS to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, that the Reading of the Holy Scriptures, and the hearing of them read, is a part of GOD's Publick Wor|&s;hip, will appear, if we con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT the LORD doth very expre&s;sly require the Reading and hearing of His Word, as a part of His Publick Wor&s;hip.</HI> In the Text now under Con&s;ideration, <HI>When all I&s;rael come to appear before the Lord thy God, in the Place which he &s;hall chu&s;e: thou &s;halt read this law before all I&s;rael, in their hearing. Gather the people together, Men, Women, and Children, and thy Stranger that is within thy Gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your GOD, and ob&s;erve to do all the words of this law.</HI> This Command is &s;o expre&s;s, plain, and full, for the Publick Reading of the Holy Scriptures, that all who take the Re|vealed
<PB N="6" REF="002122_0011_0FBC202EDDD77720">Will of GOD for the Rule of their performances, and acknowledge the Scrip|tures of the <HI>Old</HI> Te&s;tament, to be of equal authority with tho&s;e of the <HI>New;</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o own their obligation to the performance of this, as a part of GOD's Publick Wor&s;hip; if they duely con&s;ider the matter: for all Mo|ral Precepts, given to the Church of the <HI>Jews,</HI> under the Law are as binding upon us <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as they were upon them. Neither can it be alleged, with any &s;hew of Rea&s;on, that this is a <HI>Ceremonial</HI> or <HI>Temporary</HI> Pre|cept, which did concern the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church, under the former di&s;pen&s;ation only; &s;eeing the end of the Command, and the rea&s;ons an|nexed to it, by the Spirit of GOD, to inforce it, concern <HI>all the profe&s;&s;ed People of GOD,</HI> to the end of the World, as much as they did the <HI>Jews,</HI> under the Law. The Rea&s;ons an|nexed to this Command are two, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1) THOU &s;halt read this Law before all I&s;rael in their hearing, <HI>That they may hear and &s;carn,</HI> i. e. That they may &s;o hear as to learn. We mu&s;t &s;tudy &s;o to read and hear the Word of GOD, that we may under&s;tand the My&s;te|ries of our holy religion out of the Revelati|ons and Di&s;coveries He hath given of them in His word. We mu&s;t read and hear the Scriptures that we may learn what is our
<PB N="7" REF="002122_0012_0FBC203020081A90">duty, towards GOD, towards our Neigh|bour, and towards our &s;elves. The Scrip|tures mu&s;t be read &amp; heard, that the LORDS People may learn what they are to expect at the hand of GOD; provided they &s;hall con|tinue Con&s;tant, and faithful in their Obedi|ence to Him: and what they have to fear, if they neglect their duty, and tran&s;gre&s;s His Law.</P>
<P>(2) THE Law mu&s;t be read before all I&s;rael, <HI>That they may hear and fear the LORD their GOD,</HI> i. e. That they may Wor&s;hip and Serve the LORD, after an acceptable manner. The LORD will have His People to learn their Obedience to Him, out of His Own Word: for the Revealed Will of GOD, contains the Rule and Mea&s;ure of that Wor|&s;hip and Obedience which we owe unto Him: therefore it is added, <HI>That they may ob&s;erve to do all the words of this Law:</HI> i. e. that they may ob&s;erve to do every thing that the Law commands to be done.</P>
<P>NOW the&s;e are the things that <HI>we</HI> have as much need to learn, as the <HI>Jews</HI> had; and are as much obliged to do, as they were: and therefore &s;eeing the Reading, and Hear|ing of the holy Scriptures, in our Publick religious A&s;&s;emblies, is a mean appointed by GOD to the&s;e Important purpo&s;es; it ought
<PB N="8" REF="002122_0013_0FBC2031A08F4808">not to be neglected by us. And the Rea&s;ons of GOD's Command, being the &s;ame to us, that they were to the <HI>Jews</HI> under the Law; the Command it &s;elf mu&s;t oblige us, as much as it did them. And that it was the Will of GOD, when He fir&s;t gave this Law to His People, that this Ordinance &s;hould be kept up in His Church, in all &s;ucceeding Genera|tions; and that it &s;hould be made a part of their &s;tated Publick Wor&s;hip every Sabbath-day, &s;eems to be clearly intimated in the&s;e words in the 13th ver&s;e. <HI>That their Children which have not known any thing, may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as you live in the Land, whither ye go over Jordan to po&s;&s;e&s;s it.</HI> And thus the pious <HI>Jews</HI> under the Law, did under&s;tand this Precept, &s;eeing they made the Publick Reading of the Law and the Prophets, always a part of their Sab|bath-days wor&s;hip, Of which <HI>Ain&s;worth</HI> out of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Doctors gives us the following account, in his Annotations on <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.9.
<Q>The&s;e three Letters in the Hebrew Bibles do &s;ignifie the <HI>Para&s;ha,</HI> or great Section of Mo&s;es Law, which was a Lecture on the Sabbath-day, read in the Jews Synagogues, as is ob&s;erved, <HI>Acts</HI> 15.21. to which was added a Lecture out of the Prophets, <HI>Acts</HI> 13.15. And the fir&s;t Paragraph or Section
<PB N="9" REF="002122_0014_0FBC2033414DA610">(which is from the Creation hitherto) they call <HI>Bere&s;hith,</HI> i. e. in the beginning. The &s;econd, which reacheth to the XII. Chapter, they call <HI>Noe;</HI> and &s;o the re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There are in all, 54 Sections in the Law, which they read in the 52. Sabbaths, joyn|ing two of the &s;horte&s;t twice together; that the whole may be fini&s;hed in a Years &s;pace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Here the Jewi&s;h Doctors write thus. <HI>It is a Common Cu&s;tom, throughout all I&s;rael, that they fini&s;h wholly the</HI> (reading of the) <HI>Law in one Year: beginning in the Sabbath, which is after the fea&s;t of Tabernacles, at the fir&s;t Section of Gene&s;is: In the &s;econd Sabbath,</HI> at, <HI>The&s;e are the Generations</HI> of <HI>Noe. In the third,</HI> at, <HI>The Lord &s;aid unto Abram,</HI> Gen. 12.1. <HI>So they read and go on in this order, till they have ended the Law,</HI> at <HI>the fea&s;t of Tabernacles.</HI></Q> So far he.</P>
<P>THAT this was the continued practice of the <HI>Jews,</HI> even in CHRIST, and His A|po&s;tles time, is evident from &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the New-Te&s;tament. As that in <HI>Acts</HI> 15.21. <HI>For Mo&s;es of old, hath in every City them that Preach him, being read in their Synagogues every Sabbath-day.</HI> Here we may ob&s;erve, (1) That the <HI>Reading</HI> of the holy Scriptures, is called, by the In&s;pired Hi&s;torian, <HI>Preaching.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002122_0015_0FBC2034CD282DE8">(2) That the Practice of Reading the holy Scriptures in their Synagogues, was, by the <HI>Jews</HI> repeated every Sabbath-day; and con|&s;equently, was a part of their &s;tated Publick Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>IT is recorded al&s;o in <HI>Acts</HI> 13.14. <HI>That when they;</HI> viz. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas, departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pi&s;idia, and went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and &s;at down; And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the Synagogue &s;ent unto them, &s;aying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of Exhortation to the People, &s;ay on.</HI> Here we may ob&s;erve, (1) That the reading of the Law and the Prophets was at|tended upon by the <HI>Jews,</HI> as a part of GOD's Publick Wor&s;hip; &s;eeing it was performed by them, in their Synagogue, the Place of GOD's Publick Wor&s;hip; and on the Sabbath-day. (2) That this Reading of the Law and the Prophets did precede Exhortation, (or that which we commonly call Preaching) and that it was di&s;tinct from it. (3) That the Apo&s;tles of our Lord JESUS CHRIST did attend the Reading of the Law and the Prophets, as a part of GOD's Publick Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>AND our Saviour al&s;o Him&s;elf did coun|tenance and approve this Reading of the holy Scriptures, in Publick, as a part of GOD's
<PB N="11" REF="002122_0016_0FBC203626D4A898">Wor&s;hip, by His frequent attending upon it; and by His practi&s;ing of it Him&s;elf. We are informed by the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Luke,</HI> Luk. 4.16, 17. <HI>That he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up: and as his cu&s;tom was, he went in|to the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and &s;tood up for to Read.</HI> Here we may ob&s;erve, (1) That it was our Saviours <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> to attend the Publick Wor&s;hip of GOD, as performed by the <HI>Jews</HI> in their Synagogue on the Sabbath-day; where the Reading of the Law and the Pro|phets was a con&s;iderable part of that Wor|&s;hip. (2) That our Saviour did Read the holy Scriptures him&s;elf, as a part of GOD's Publick Wor&s;hip, and that it was His Cu&s;tom &s;o to do; which no doubt is recorded for our In&s;truction and Imitation.</P>
<P>AND from the Practice of the <HI>Jews</HI> in their Synagogues in making the Reading of the Scriptures a part of their &s;tated Publick Wor&s;hip, the like order was brought into the Chri&s;tian Church; and the Reading of the Scriptures is made part of the Office of the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, as it had been of the Prie&s;ts and Levites under the Law. <HI>Timothy</HI> is commanded by the Apo&s;tle, in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.13. <HI>To give attendance to Reading, as well as to Exhortation and Doctrine.</HI> The&s;e Epi&s;tles to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> have been con&s;idered as a
<PB N="32" REF="002122_0017_0FBC2037D9F69F28">Directory, given by the Spirit of GOD, to the&s;e two Evangeli&s;ts, how they &s;hould be|have them&s;elves in the Hou&s;e of GOD; and in them, to all Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters in all Suc|ceeding Ages of the Church; and as the Ex|hortation and Doctrine, which the Evangeli&s;t here is directed to give attendance unto, are of a Publick Nature; &s;o the Reading poin|ted at, &s;eems al&s;o to be. The thing he was to read, no doubt, was the holy Scriptures; and the Reading it &s;elf a Publick act of his &s;acred Office, &amp; cannot be re&s;tricted to his Pri|vate Studies, which he was to follow in or|der to his being fitted &amp; prepared for Pub|lick Work.</P>
<P>THE in&s;pired writings al&s;o of the Apo&s;tles were Commanded to be Read by Chri&s;tians, in their Publick religious A&s;&s;emblies. It is Commanded by the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Col.</HI> 4.16. <HI>When this Epi&s;tle is read among&s;t you, Cau&s;e that it be read al&s;o in the Church of the Laodiceans; and that ye al&s;o read the Epi&s;tle from Laodicea.</HI> The Apo&s;tle gives a very &s;olemn Charge to the Church of <HI>The&s;&s;alonica</HI> to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, in 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.27. <HI>I charge you by the Lord that this Epi&s;tle be read unto all the holy Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>AND it is highly probable that what was enjoyned the&s;e Churches mentioned, was ex|pected from, and practi&s;ed by all the Chri&s;ti|an
<PB N="13" REF="002122_0018_0FBC203A2DB73770">Churches, to whom the Apo&s;tle wrote. And this will appear, if we con&s;ider, (1) That the Apo&s;tolical Epi&s;tles &s;ent to particular Churches, are directed to them as a Society. (2) The Doctrines in&s;i&s;ted upon in the&s;e E|pi&s;tles are of a Publick Nature, and concern all the Members of the Church; and there|fore all had a right to be acquainted with them.</P>
<P>THIS Publick Reading of the holy Scrip|tures was appointed by GOD as a mean for the pre&s;erving the Knowledge of Him&s;elf among His People, &amp; to &s;tir them up to per&s;e|vere in their Obedience to Him; and there|fore whenever this came to be neglected, the LORD's People did quickly &s;ink into Ido|latry &amp; Immorality. In the wicked Reigns of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> and <HI>Amon</HI> his Son, it &s;eems the book of the Law of GOD was lo&s;t; which was found by <HI>Hilkiah</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> while they were repairing and clean&s;ing the Temple. And in the&s;e two Reigns the <HI>Jew|i&s;h</HI> Church was degenerated to an a&s;toni&s;h|ing degree. And the mo&s;t glorious Refor|mations that were &s;et on foot in that Church, were begun, and carried on, by re&s;toring this Ordinance. It is recorded of King <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> that pious Prince and great Reformer, in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 34.29. <HI>Then the King &s;ent, and gathered
<PB N="14" REF="002122_0019_0FBC203B6FDFA168">all the Eldors of Judah, and Jeru&s;alem, and the King went up into the hou&s;e of the Lord, and all the men of Judah, and Inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem. And the Prie&s;ts, and the Levites, and all the People great and &s;mall; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the Covenant, that was found in the hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ame Method was followed by <HI>Ezra</HI> the Prie&s;t, in his pious endeavours towards the carrying on a univer&s;al Reformation a|mong the LORD's People, after their return from the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Captivity, as is recorded, <HI>Neh.</HI> 8.2, 3. <HI>And Ezra the Prie&s;t brought the Law before the Congregation, both of men and women, and all that could hear with under&s;tand|ing; upon the fir&s;t day of the &s;econd Month and he read therein, before the Street, that was be|fore the water gate, from the Morning, until mid-day, before the men, and the women, and all tho&s;e that could under&s;tand.</HI></P>
<P>THUS we have &s;een that the Reading and Hearing of the holy Scriptures Read, in the Publick A&s;&s;emblies of GOD's People, hath been expre&s;sly commanded by GOD Him&s;elf, both in the Old and New-Te&s;taments: And that this Publick Reading, and hearing of the Scriptures, hath been practi&s;ed by the godly, both under the <HI>Law,</HI> and under the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> as a &s;tated part of GOD's Publick Wor&s;hip,
<PB N="15" REF="002122_0020_0FBC20400E0F4DE0">and that CHRIST Him&s;elf and His holy Apo&s;tles, did countenance and approve of it, both by their being frequently pre&s;ent at it, and by their own practice.</P>
<P>AND it is highly rea&s;onable that the LORD's People &s;hould continue the practice of Reading the holy Scriptures in their Pub|lick religious A&s;&s;emblies, not only becau&s;e GOD hath expre&s;sly commanded it, which indeed &s;hould have the mo&s;t powerful Influ|ence upon us, in all our undertakings &amp; per|formances; but al&s;o becau&s;e of the un&s;peak|able advantages which we may expect from it.

<P>THE holy Scriptures may be con&s;idered as an Epi&s;tle &s;ent down from Heaven, by GOD Him&s;elf, to the Children of Men here below, containing in it, a plain and full Re|velation of all the My&s;teries of our holy Reli|gion; and a Declaration of tho&s;e Divine Truths which mu&s;t be known and firmly be|lieved by us, in order to Salvation: and the Infallible Rules by which our Lives and Practices mu&s;t be regulated: And the &s;ure Charter by which we hold our Title to Hea|ven, and to all the valuable Ble&s;&s;ings &amp; Pri|vileges made over to us, in the Go&s;pel-Co|venant.

<P N="1">1.

BUT &s;eeing it is generally acknowledged by Chri&s;tians, that the Publick Reading of the holy Scriptures is a duty which GOD hath enjoyned His People the performance of, and that the far greater part of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians do actually practi&s;e it, I &s;hall not, at pre&s;ent in&s;i&s;t any longer in the proof of it, but proceed to the &s;econd general Head, Which is to Inquire, How this part of GOD's Publick Wor&s;hip ought to be performed by the LORD'S People? And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT ought, without doubt, to be performed with much Reverence &amp; Solemnity.</HI> Thus did the Church of the <HI>Jews</HI> attend upon it. It is recorded in <HI>Luke</HI> 4.16. That our Saviour <HI>&s;tood up,</HI> when He addre&s;&s;ed Him&s;elf to the Read|ing of the Scriptures, as an evidence, no doubt, of the reverent regard He had to the&s;e Sacred Records, and that He might In&s;truct us by His holy Example. We are informed, <HI>Neb. 8.5. And Ezra opened the book in the &s;ight of all the people; (for he was above all the people) and when he opened it, all the people &s;tood up.</HI> And indeed it is highly rea&s;onable, that this part of GOD's Publick Wor&s;hip &s;hould be attended by His People with holy fear and reverence, &s;eeing herein GOD &s;peaks to us in a more Immediate way; and that about matters of the greate&s;t Importance.
<PB N="21" REF="002122_0026_0FBC204BDF5D8698">If reverence be due when we &s;peak more di|rectly to GOD, as in Prayer, It mu&s;t be very becoming &amp; nece&s;&s;ary, when He &s;peaks to us.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> before they ingaged in this part of GOD's Publick Wor&s;hip, did addre&s;s them&s;elves to GOD, who&s;e Word they were about to Read, in &s;olemn Prayer. It is &s;aid in <HI>Neb.</HI> 8.6. <HI>And Ezra ble&s;&s;ed the Lord, the great God, and all the People an&s;wered, Amen, amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their beads and wor&s;hipped the Lord, with their faces to the ground.</HI> And it was u&s;ual with them al&s;o to conclude the Publick Reading of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">w, with &s;olemn Prayer: As <HI>Ain&s;worth</HI> out of the Jewi&s;h Doctors, ob|&s;erves, upon the Text now under our Con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE holy Scriptures ought to be Read and Heard, by the Lord's People, with much Se|riou&s;ne&s;s and Attention, with a heart prepared, and very de&s;irous to Learn and Under&s;tand the mind of GOD held &s;orth to us in His Word.</HI> When the great GOD &s;peaks, Carele&s;ne&s;s and Indifferency in us, is very unbecoming, and un&s;uitable. It is recorded in <HI>Neb.</HI> 8.3. <HI>And he read therein before the &s;treet that was before the water gate, from the morning until mid-day, before the men, and the women, and tho&s;e that could under&s;tand; and the ears of all
<PB N="22" REF="002122_0027_0FBC204DA6000AE8">the People were Attentive unto the book of the Law.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE holy Scriptures ought &s;o to be Read, that they may be Under&s;tood by the People, before whom they are read.</HI> The end of this Publick Reading is, that the People may learn to fear the LORD; and therefore they are &s;o to be read, that this end may be effectually reached. They are therefore to be Read in a Lan|guage wherewith the People are acquainted: and the difficulties that may occur in our Reading, ought to be cleared to the capacity of the Hearers. And &s;uch ob&s;ervations made upon what we Read, and &s;uch Inferences drawn from it, as may contribute mo&s;t effectually, to it's being put in practice. A|greeable to this Method, it is ob&s;erved in <HI>Neb.</HI> 8.8. <HI>So they read in the book, in the law of the Lord di&s;tinctly, and gave the &s;ence, and cau&s;ed them to under&s;tand the reading.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THE holy Scriptures &s;hou'd be Read, by the LORD's People, in their Publick A&s;&s;em|blies, Orderly.</HI> What was practiced by the Jewi&s;h Church, with re&s;pect here-unto, we have &s;een already; they began at the begin|ning of the Old Te&s;tament, in the Sabbath after the fea&s;t of Tabernacles; and &s;o read the whole over in order in the &s;pace of a Year. This they did no doubt, that the
<PB N="23" REF="002122_0028_0FBC204EE14FF440">People might be acquainted, with the <HI>whole</HI> revealed Will of GOD. There is no part of holy Scripture unnece&s;&s;ary; no part of it is unprofitable; it is all u&s;eful, edifying, and in&s;tructive: and therefore no part of it is to be pa&s;&s;ed over in our Reading; no part &s;hould be omitted: we are told, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16. <HI>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furni&s;hed, unto all good works.</HI> The Command of GOD to His People is, that His Law be Read in their Publick A&s;&s;emblies; and the de&s;ign of the Command cannot be fully an&s;wered by them, if any part of it be omitted in their Publick Reading of it. It is ob&s;erved of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to his Commendation, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 8.35. <HI>That there was not a word of all that Mo&s;es command|ed, which Jo&s;hua read not, before all the Con|gregation of I&s;rael, with the Women, and little Ones, and the Strangers that were conver&s;ant among them.</HI></P>
<P>WE have this Reading of the holy Scrip|tures in <HI>Order,</HI> recommended to us by the A&s;&s;embly of Divines at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> in their Directory for Publick Wor&s;hip, in the&s;e words;
<Q>It is requi&s;ite that all the Canoni|cal books, be read over in Order, that
<PB N="24" REF="002122_0029_0FBC20505D24CCD8">the People may be better acquainted with the whole body of Scriptures.</Q></P>
<P>THE LORD hath not determined in His Word, how much of the holy Scriptures &s;hould be Read at one time by His People, in their Publick A&s;&s;emblies; that &s;eems to be left to Chri&s;tian prudence to determine. The whole revealed Will of GOD mu&s;t be Read; and therefore it &s;hould be Read in &s;uch Portions, that the LORD's People who attend upon this Publick Reading, may be acquainted with the whole coun&s;el of GOD.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Publick</HI> Reading of the holy Scrip|ture, doth by no means, free the LORD'S People from the <HI>Private</HI> Reading of them: GOD hath Commanded both, and therefore both mu&s;t be made Con&s;cience of by all that would approve them&s;elves to GOD. As to the Private Reading of the Scriptures, we have the following direction, <HI>Deut.</HI> 6.6. <HI>The&s;e words which I command thee this day, &s;hall be in thy peart and thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and &s;halt talk of them, when thou &s;itte&s;t in thy hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the way, and when thou lye&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.

<P N="1">1. <HI>HENCE we may infer, That it mu&s;t be Culpable in any who profe&s;s them&s;elves to be the LORD's People, to live in the neglect of the Publick Reading of the holy Scriptures in their Religious A&s;&s;emblies, as a part of GOD's Wor&s;hip;</HI> upon what pretence &s;oever this may be done, &s;eeing we have GOD's expre&s;s Command for the doing of it, and the Ex|ample of CHRIST and His Apo&s;tles, pro|po&s;ed to us, for our Imitation therein.</P>
<P>IT cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that our Reading a ver&s;e or two for a Text, on the LORDS day, or a few ver&s;es quoted by us, in the cour&s;e of our Sermons, for the Confirmation and Illu&s;tration of the Doctrine we undertake to explain and apply to our hearers; can be any tolerable an&s;wering of the de&s;ign of this Command; &s;eeing it is certain that notwith|&s;tanding all the People hear out of the holy Scriptures this way, they may remain great Strangers to no &s;mall part of GOD's revea|led Will.</P>

This would be to arraign the Wi&s;dom of GOD as defective, in appointing a thing to be done by His People, and that in His own Wor&s;hip, that is unprofitable and needle&s;s, and a calling in que&s;tion His Authority over us. It belongs to Him to give Direction how He will be wor&s;hipped and &s;erved by His Subjects &amp; Servants, and He doth not al|low, that any of His Commands be debated by them. It is our duty to Obey GOD; and not pre&s;cribe to Him. It is without doubt, the nece&s;&s;ary duty of all, who have any true zeal for the Glory of GOD, and the credit of Religion, that they manife&s;t an honoura|ble regard to the holy Scriptures, by decla|ring publickly &amp; practically, that they look upon them as the Infallible Rule of faith and practice, at a time when all revealed Religion is decry'd by many; and whole volumes written again&s;t it by Men who pre|tend
<PB N="27" REF="002122_0032_0FBC205671E90DC8">to a greater &s;hare of under&s;tanding and penetration than others. Surely it mu&s;t be our duty to do what we can towards the &s;topping the awful progre&s;s of the pre&s;ent prevailing Apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THEY that live in the allowed Omi&s;&s;ion of this part of GOD's Publick Wor&s;hip, becau&s;e they do not look upon it as any part of their duty; are hence exhorted to allow this matter a Serious and Impartial Examination.</HI> You can|not otherwi&s;e acquit your &s;elves of too great a degree of negligence about the Wor&s;hip of GOD.

<P N="2">2. <HI>IS that Law whereby GOD hath &s;o ex|pre&s;sly Commanded the Publick Reading of the Scriptures,</HI> a Ceremonial, <HI>or a</HI> Moral <HI>Law?

<P>HE that has Commanded us, <HI>Not to fol|low a Multitude to do evil,</HI> Exod. 23.2. Will, without doubt, approve of our Reforming what we find ami&s;s in our own way.

<PB N="31" REF="002122_0036_0FBC205DF1354658">directed us to walk in. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is that &s;er|vant whom his Lord when he cometh, &s;hall find &s;o doing,</HI> Mat. 24.46.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude what I de&s;ign upon this &s;ubject at this time, with the following Di|rections.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHEN we Read, or Hear the holy Scrip|tures Read; We &s;hould Con&s;ider them, not as the words of Men, but as the Words of the Li|ving and True GOD, whereby He di&s;covers to us matters of the bigge&s;t Importance.</HI> And therefore that they ought to be Read and Heard with the profounde&s;t Reverence, and the greate&s;t Attention and Application of Mind that we are capable of. It is recorded to the honour of the believing <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> 1 The&s;. 2.13. <HI>For this cau&s;e thank we God without cea&s;ing, becau&s;e when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is an truth) the Word of God, which effectually worketh al&s;o in you that believe.</HI> When we are Reading, or Hearing the Scripture Read; we &s;hould think with our &s;elves, Now the great GOD the Creator &amp; Supream Gover|nour of the World is Speaking, and He di|recis His Speech particularly to me, in mat|ters wherein His own Glory, and the Wel|fare
<PB N="32" REF="002122_0037_0FBC205F5D2E2378">of my own Soul are nearly concerned; and He is ob&s;erving how I behave my &s;elf in the pre&s;ent duty; and will call me to a particular and &s;trict Account how I behave my &s;elf herein: and therefore I had need to manage the Duty I am engaged in, with all &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and circum&s;pectne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IN our Reading and Hearing the Scrip|tures, we &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly Con&s;ider, to what End the <HI>LORD</HI> gave his revealed Will to Men, and hath &s;o clearly revealed Him&s;elf to them therein.</HI> We are told that all Scrip|ture is given by In&s;piration of GOD, and is profitable for doctrine for reproof, for cor|rection, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the Man of GOD may be perfect, throughly furni&s;hed unto all good works. The Scriptures are given that we may learn to fear GOD, that we may be directed how we may glorifie GOD, and enjoy Him for ever; and therefore in our Reading and Hearing of them Read, we &s;hould &s;tudy to fall in with GOD's glorious De&s;ign in gi|ving His Word to us: Otherwi&s;e we mu&s;t fall mort of the <HI>End</HI> which we &s;hould pro|po&s;e to our &s;elves in the&s;e religious Ex|erci&s;es.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="33" REF="002122_0038_0FBC2063E064FBE8">
3. <HI>WE &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly Con&s;ider, that we mu&s;t give an Account to GOD, how we have Improved His Word, how we have Read it, and how we have Heard it, and what profit and ad|vantage we have had by both, and what effect the Word of GOD hath had upon us.</HI> Have we been led thereby to frame right Concep|tions of GOD, of our &s;elves, and of the World? And what Influence it hath had upon our Conver&s;ation? Have we been thereby induced to ingage in the Study of a <HI>Univer&s;al Holine&s;s?</HI> to a ready and chear|ful Obedience to <HI>all GOD's Commands?</HI> And to an <HI>Intire</HI> Re&s;ignation of our &s;elves to the Will of GOD in all things?</P>
<P>IF we receive no advantage by our Read|ing and Hearing of the Scriptures, we may conclude that there mu&s;t be &s;omething a|mi&s;s in our way and manner of doing of it, which we &s;hould &s;earch and try, until we have found it out; and when we have found it we &s;hould immediately &s;et about the Reforming of what has been ami&s;s in our managing of that Important Duty.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="002122_0039_0FBC2065623B90A8">
To Conclude, In our Reading and Hear|ing the holy Scriptures, we &s;hould look un|to, and depend upon GOD for His Ble&s;&s;ing upon His own Word, that it may become the Power of GOD to Salvation to all of us. That we may be gradually prepared for Heaven, and for the Immediate Enjoyment of GOD the chief Good; <HI>For &s;o an entrance &s;hall be mini&s;tred unto us abundantly, into the everla&s;ting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour</HI> JESUS CHRIST, 2 Pet. 1.11.</P>
