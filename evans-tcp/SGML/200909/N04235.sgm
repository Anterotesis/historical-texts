<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>_WHAT I aim at in this &s;mall Tract, is, to be a little u&s;eful to Young Gentlemen that are to be introduced into the Knowlege of the Sciences, (to whom they at fir&s;t appear like a meer Wilderne&s;s,) by &s;etting before them a <HI>General View</HI> of the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem of Learning,</HI> as it were in Miniature; wherein they may at once behold, not only the Objects, Boundaries, Ends and U&s;es of each of the Sciences; but at the &s;ame time, their Foundation in the nature of things; the natural Order wherein they lie; and their &s;everal Relations, Connexions and Dependences, both with re&s;pect one to another, and to the General End, <HI>viz.</HI> Our <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> which is pur&s;ued through them all.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to me as u&s;eful in the Instruction of young Beginners in the Study of the Sciences, as it is in teaching <HI>Geography,</HI> to exhibit fir&s;t of all a general Map of the whole Terraqueous Globe, in order to a more particular De&s;cription of the &s;everal Countries and Kingdoms in the following Maps: And likewi&s;e in teaching <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> to give fir&s;t a general Delineation of the whole System of the world, in order to account for the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the &s;everal particular Planets in the following Schemes. &mdash; For as in the <HI>Natural World.</HI>
<PB N="ii" REF="005220_0003_1018B1DCC4EEA260">
one cannot have a ju&s;t Notion of any particular Country, without con&s;idering it's Situation in relation to the whole Globe, nor of any particular Globe, with|out con&s;idering it's Situation with re&s;pect to the whole System: So neither in the <HI>Intellectual World,</HI> (if I may &s;o call it, I can one have a ju&s;t Notion of any particular Science without con&s;idering it as it &s;tands related to the whole Sy&s;tem of Learning, and to the general End pur&s;ued through the whole. &mdash; I have therefore drawn up this <HI>General View of Philo&s;ophy</HI> for the u&s;e of young Students, that whatever Subject they are upon in the Cour&s;e of their Studies, they may know to which Science it belongs, and what relation it bears to the whole Sy&s;tem; which may, perhaps, be of &s;ome u&s;e to direct and methodize their Thoughts and enlarge their Minds: And thus to open to them at once a pro&s;pect of the whole Compa&s;s of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, may al&s;o engage them to a more earne&s;t and indu&s;trious Ap|plication in the pur&s;uit of their Studies for the accompli&s;hment of it.</P>
<P>Not that I would be under&s;tood to think this the proper Order in which the Sciences are to be taught. &mdash; There are many obvious Rea&s;ons that render it highly Convenient to begin the In|&s;truction of youth with the <HI>Languages</HI> and the <HI>Ma|thematics</HI> (which are them&s;elves indeed a kind of Language;) for the&s;e are both of them a nece&s;&s;ary Furniture in order to the attainment of any con&s;ide|rable Perfection in the other parts of Learning. &mdash;
<PB N="iii" REF="005220_0004_1018B1DE46EE2B80">
And be&s;ides, the <HI>Languages</HI> are be&s;t &s;uited to their lively Imaginations, mo&s;t ea&s;ily retained by their young Memories, and mo&s;t obvious to their little &V;nder&s;tandings: And the <HI>Mathematics</HI> are very u&s;eful to inure them to thinking, to po&s;&s;e&s;s them of a Habit of clo&s;e Application, and by that means ripen their Minds to a fixed and &s;trong attention to the Objects about which they are employed. &mdash; It is be&s;t therefore that they &s;hould be long inured to the&s;e parts of Learning, before they proceed to the &s;ublimer Studies of <HI>Logic</HI> and <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Moral Philo&s;ophy.</HI></P>
<P>And, perhaps it was for this Rea&s;on that <HI>Gram|mar, Oratory, Hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>Poetry</HI> and the <HI>Ma|thematics</HI> have not been commonly accounted parts of <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> but rather In&s;tructions introductory thereunto; namely, becau&s;e they were chiefly the Studies about which Youth were generally employed among the Ancients <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Quin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">til,</HI> Li. 1.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> 10. &amp; <HI>Plato</HI> De Rep. l. 7. &amp; Epinon.</NOTE>; and accordingly the Term <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> has been appropriated to <HI>Logic</HI> and <HI>Metaphy&s;ics, Phy&s;ics</HI> and <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> and <HI>Pneumatology, Morality</HI> and <HI>Politics</HI> &mdash; I thought however it would be mo&s;t convenient for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to deduce them from tho&s;e general <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> to which they may be referred, and to make them, if not parts, at lea&s;t Appendages to tho&s;e parts of <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> on which they are founded, &amp; with which they have a natural and nece&s;&s;ary Connection. For whether they are
<PB N="iv" REF="005220_0005_1018B1E0F6C78388">
properly parts of <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> or not, it is not worth the while to di&s;pute; tho' I believe it was never doubted but that they are accompli&s;hments that are e&s;&s;ential to the Character of a complete Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>However, as I &s;aid, It is nece&s;&s;ary to begin the In&s;truction of Youth with the <HI>Languages</HI> and <HI>Ma|thematics.</HI>&mdash; The&s;e &s;hould all along while they are at the Schools be taught together: The <HI>Lan|guages</HI> and <HI>Cla&s;&s;ics</HI> as their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the ea&s;ie&s;t and plaine&s;t things in the <HI>Mathematics</HI> as their Diver&s;ion: &mdash; And when young Lads have been long exerci&s;ed at the Schools in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek Languages</HI> and <HI>Cla&s;&s;ics,</HI> and con&s;equently in the fir&s;t Rudiments of <HI>Grammar, Oratory, Hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>Poetry,</HI> and likewi&s;e of <HI>Arithmetic, Geometry, Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Geography;</HI> (both becau&s;e the&s;e Studies are, as I &s;aid, mo&s;t &s;uitable to their juvenile Capacities, and at the &s;ame time nece&s;&s;ary to render the other parts of Learning more ea&s;y, in|telligible and delightful;) they may then proceed at the Colleges with the greater Expedition and De|light, in perfecting them&s;elves in the&s;e Studies: (For the <HI>Cla&s;&s;ics</HI> and <HI>Mathematics</HI> &s;hould indeed never be laid a&s;ide;) and at the &s;ame time go on &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the &s;everal Studies of <HI>Metaphy&s;ics, Logic</HI> and <HI>Critici&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Mechanics, Phy&s;ic</HI> and <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> and <HI>Pneunmology, Theology, Ethics</HI> and <HI>Politics,</HI> together with the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> all in the Order wherein they here lie before them.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>General View</HI> OF PHILOSOPHY: OR AN INTRODUCTION to the Study of the ARTS and SCIENCES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>PHILOSOPHY is the Study of true Wi&s;dom, or the Study of Truth and Right, in order to the attainment of true Happi|ne&s;s. &mdash; Or it may be defined. The pur&s;uit of true Happine&s;s in the Know|lege of things as being what they really are, and in acting or practi&s;ing according to that Knowlege.</P>
<P><HI>True Wi&s;dom</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;covering the be&s;t Ends, and the fitte&s;t Means in order to the Attainment of them, and in Vigorou&s;ly pur&s;uing tho&s;e be&s;t Ends by the fitte&s;t Means. &mdash; Now the great End
<PB N="2" REF="005220_0007_1018B16264332E70">
that above all things concerns us, is, that we he truly <HI>Happy</HI> in the whole of our Nature and Du|ration; &mdash; And our true <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in that Plea&s;ure which attends the Contemplation of all things that come within the Compa&s;s of our Know|lege and e&s;pecially &s;uch as concern us, as being what they really are, and the Regulation or Govern|ment of all our Actions according thereunto: i. e. according to the Truth of things and the Laws of right Rea&s;on founded thereon. &mdash; And &s;ince this is the great End ultimately pur&s;ued through all the <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> they mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the means to our true Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>For in order that we may be compleatly happy, it is nece&s;&s;ary that all the Powers of our Souls, our <HI>Under&s;tandings, Wills</HI> and <HI>Affections,</HI> be united with their proper Objects which are <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good:</HI> And in order to this, that they be duly in&s;tructed and directed in all their Exertions, &mdash; To accompli&s;h this, therefore, is the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> which comprehends the whole Sy&s;tem of the <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences.</HI></P>
<P>So that in order the better to under&s;tand wherein our true <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> con&s;i&s;ts, and the means to it, it is nece&s;&s;ary to explain what we mean by <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good.</HI> &mdash; And in order to this, <HI>Truth</HI> mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed into <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Intellectual,</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> into <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Practical.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Natural Truth,</HI> which might rather be call'd <HI>Real Truth</HI> or the Truth of things, is nothing el&s;e but the Reality of their Exi&s;tence, as being what in fact they are, and &s;o &s;ituated and related as to con&s;titute One intire Whole or Sy&s;tem, as in fact they do. &mdash;
<PB N="3" REF="005220_0008_1018B1E7249E9E58">
And <HI>Intellectual Truth</HI> is the Knowlege of things as be|ing what they really are, their Exi&s;tence, together with all their Relations, Connexions and Dependencies among them&s;elves and with regard to the Whole.</P>
<P><HI>Natural Good</HI> is either of <HI>Things</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ons.</HI> The <HI>Natural Good</HI> of Things is their Fitne&s;s or Suita|blene&s;s to an&s;wer their &s;everal Ends as they con&s;ti|tute one intire Sy&s;tem con&s;piring to the &mdash; Order, Harmony, Beauty and U&s;efulne&s;s of the whole, &s;o as to render it, in the be&s;t manner, &s;ub&s;ervient to the Plea&s;ure and Happine&s;s of the Sen&s;itive and Rational Nature.&mdash; The <HI>Natural Good</HI> of <HI>per&s;ons</HI> is their Plea&s;ure or Happine&s;s, and the means, whether Things or Actions nece&s;&s;ary to promote it. As on the other hand, Pain or Unea&s;ine&s;s with the means that procure it are Natural Evil.</P>
<P>Now in as much as we con&s;i&s;t of a twofold <HI>Nature, Sen&s;itive</HI> and <HI>Rational,</HI> each of which have their di&s;tinct <HI>plea&s;ures</HI> and <HI>pains,</HI> there mu&s;t be two &s;orts of <HI>Good,</HI> viz. <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> and <HI>Rational</HI> or <HI>Spiritual Good.</HI> Tho&s;e things or Actions which procure and promote the Comfort and Plea&s;ure, or remove the Pain or Un|ea&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Sen&s;itive</HI> or Animal Nature, are it's <HI>Sen&s;ible Good;</HI> and tho&s;e which procure &amp; promote the Plea&s;ure and Happine&s;s or remove the Pains &amp; Mi&s;eries of the <HI>Rational</HI> or <HI>Spiritual Nature</HI> are it's <HI>Spiritual Good.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;ince we are made for a twofold State, <HI>Tempo|ral</HI> and <HI>Eternal;</HI> what tends to promote our Well-being and Happine&s;s in this World is a <HI>Temporal Good;</HI>&mdash;And what tends to promote our Future and Everla&s;ting Happine&s;s is an <HI>Eternal Good.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005220_0009_1018B1E98954EE68"><HI>Practical Good</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in our chu&s;ing &amp; doing what tends to promote our Well being and Happine&s;s.&mdash; And this is of two Kinds, corre&s;pondent to the fore|going Heads of <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> &amp; <HI>Spiritual Good,</HI> viz. <HI>Secular</HI> and <HI>Moral.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Secular Good,</HI> (if I may u&s;e &s;uch a Term) I mean, that which con&s;i&s;ts in the Practice of tho&s;e &s;everal Arts and Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es that tend to promote our outward and &s;en&s;ible Wellbeing in this Life, or the temporal Comfort and Plea&s;ure of our Animal and Sen&s;itive Nature.</P>
<P>And <HI>Moral Good</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in our chu&s;ing or refu&s;ing, and embracing or rejecting either Things or Actions according as they do or do not tend to make our <HI>Rational</HI> or <HI>Moral</HI> Nature, in the whole ultimately happy, <HI>i. e.</HI> in Time and to all Eternity. &mdash; And contrary to this is <HI>Moral Evil.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> The&s;e &s;everal Kinds of Good, are either <HI>Private</HI> or <HI>Public,</HI> according as they relate either to <HI>one Per&s;on</HI> &s;ingly con&s;idered, or con&s;idered in relation to the <HI>whole System,</HI> whether <HI>Moral</HI> or <HI>Political.</HI></P>
<P>From the&s;e Di&s;tinctions of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> it ap|pears that our true Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in both <HI>Con|templation</HI> and <HI>Practice:</HI> in the <HI>Contemplation</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> and in the <HI>practice</HI> of that which is <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Right:</HI> Or which is the &s;ame thing, in <HI>Knowlege</HI> and <HI>Virtue:</HI> In the <HI>Knowlege</HI> of all things that come within the Reach of our Under&s;tandings as being what they really are, and in always <HI>chu&s;ing</HI> and <HI>do|ing</HI> what&s;oever Truth and Right Rea&s;on dictate as nece&s;&s;ary to be cho&s;en and done in order to our true Happine&s;s, in the whole of o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> Nature &amp; Duration, i.e. as comprehending both <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> and <HI>Spiritual,</HI> and both <HI>Private</HI> and <HI>Public</HI> Well being.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="005220_0010_1018B15E028FB748">He therefore that is furni&s;hed with all Kinds of Knowlege and Vertue, both Private &amp; Public is truly a Philo&s;opher, as being not only happy him&s;elf; but al&s;o at the &s;ame time Qualified in the be&s;t manner to do good and de&s;erve well of Mankind. For &s;ince to know things as being what they really are, is to con|&s;ider them in all their Relations as con&s;tituting one intire Sy&s;tem or Whole; it mu&s;t follow from what has been &s;aid, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to the Character o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Definition of a true Philo&s;opher, That he throughly under&s;tands, not only his own Per&s;onal Good, but al&s;o wherein the Publick Good, or the Good of the Whole con&s;i&s;ts, (with which his own is indeed in the Nature of things, always connected and co|incident,) and that in all his Conduct he firmly and &s;teadily adheres to it, and ever acts with a &s;in|cere, Zealous and di&s;intere&s;ted View at promoting it.</P>
<P>Now there are two <HI>General Heads</HI> to which all Beings or Things that come within the Reach of our Powers may be referred, and which con&s;titute the in|tire <HI>Great Sy&s;tem</HI> of the <HI>Univer&s;e,</HI> viz <HI>Bodies</HI> &amp; <HI>Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Bodies</HI> we mean the extended, Solid Beings that we perceive by our Sen&s;es, and as &s;uch, are meerly pa&s;&s;ive and inert; i. e. utterly de&s;titute even of the lea&s;t degree of Perception or Activity. Such are all &s;en&s;ible Things, as con&s;i&s;ting of certain fixed Combi|nations of &s;en&s;ible Qualities, &s;uch as Exten&s;ion, Fi|gure, Solidity, Motion or Re&s;t, Colours, Sounds, Ta&s;tes, Smells, Heat or Cold, Hardne&s;s or Softne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In &s;hort, What&s;oever we perceive by our Sen&s;es.&mdash; And the <HI>Whole System</HI> of <HI>Bodies</HI> or Sen&s;ible things is what we mean by <HI>Univer&s;al Nature,</HI> and is called the Sen&s;ible, the Corporeal or <HI>Natural World;</HI> the &s;ame being Sub&s;i&s;ted, acted and adju&s;ted by an Infinitely Wi&s;e and Powerful <HI>Mind.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005220_0011_1018B1EF7349D260">And by <HI>Spirits</HI> are meant &s;uch perceiving, intelligent and active Beings as we are con&s;cious we our &s;elves are having the powers of Reflecting, Thinking, Rea|&s;oning, Under&s;tanding, Willing, Loving, Chu&s;ing and Acting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the <HI>whole Sy&s;tem</HI> of <HI>Spirits</HI> or Intel|ligent Beings, as being endowed with Under&s;tanding, Coun&s;el, De&s;ign and Liberty of Acting, and therefore capable of Moral Agency, and under the Conduct and Moral Government of the DEITY, (the &s;ame In|finite Mind, who is the Supreme Father, King and Lord of all,) is called the Intelligent, Spiritual or <HI>Moral World.</HI> So that the whole of our <HI>Knowlege</HI> and <HI>Activity</HI> relates either to the <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Moral World,</HI> and the one as fitted to the other.&mdash;</P>
<P>But though the Order wherein we at fir&s;t acquire the Knowlege of things in our Childhood, is to be|gin with the Notices&mdash;of Sen&s;ible Objects which make the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions upon us, and then by de|grees we proceed to reflect, and from what we per|ceive in Others and are con&s;cious of within our &s;elves, we gain &s;ome Notion of &s;piritual Beings; Yet in order to improve our Selves both in Knowlege and Vertue by the Study of Philo&s;ophy; In as much as it is by our Spirits or Minds that we are at all capable of either Contemplation or Practice; and &s;eeing they are liable to Error in Contemplation as well as to irregularity and Viciou&s;ne&s;s in Practice, (in both which con&s;i&s;ts our greate&s;t depravity and Mi&s;ery;) It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that we begin with them: And <HI>first</HI> learn to know and cultivate our Intellectual or <HI>Rational powers,</HI> that we may be under the better Advantage to &s;ecure our &s;elves from Error and to find out and know the Truth, whether in Theory or Practice, and wherein our true Good con&s;i&s;ts &mdash; And then we &s;hall be well Qualified to proceed with Succe&s;s and Delight in the Di&s;covery and Contemplation of

<P N="1">I. <HI>First,</HI> then, we begin with our Selves and learn to know and cultivate our <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> &amp; <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> with which, (we being made for Society,) our <HI>&s;peech</HI> is nece&s;&s;arily connected, that in the right u&s;e of the&s;e <HI>Rational powers</HI> and Faculties we may, upon every Subject, both in the Natural &amp; Moral World, be enabled the better to di&s;cover the Truth and commu|nicate it one to another. &mdash; And this may be called <HI>Rational philo&s;ophy.</HI></P>

<P N="1">(1) As to <HI>Created &s;pirits,</HI> we know from our &s;elves, that they are intelligent &amp; active Beings, as having the powers of Perceiving, Imagining &amp; Remembring, of Thinking or Under&s;tanding &amp; Willing, and of freely Chu&s;ing, Refu&s;ing &amp; Acting or Exerting them&s;elves, according as they either love, hate, hope, fear, or are any otherwi&s;e affected: For of all there Perceptions and Exertions, Pa&s;&s;ions or Actions, we are con&s;cious to our &s;elves. &mdash; All the&s;e Faculties therefore are here particularly explained, and from thence it ap|pears that Spirits only can properly be &s;aid to be Effi|cient Cau&s;es, as having alone an internal Principle of

Activity or of variou&s;ly exerting &amp; determining them|&s;elves according to De&s;ign, Coun&s;el or free Choice, &amp; therefore they al&s;o alone are capable of moral Agency and moral Government. &mdash; Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">[1] This Science treats of the Nature, Powers and Operations of our <HI>Rational Souls,</HI> and of their Immor|tality and Future State of Exi&s;tence. And this may be called <HI>PSICHOLOGY.</HI></P>
<P N="2">[2] It inquires as far as we are able concerning the Exi&s;tence, Nature, Powers and Operations of other perceptive or <HI>Intelligent Active Creatures</HI> be&s;ides or Superior to us, whether Good or Evil. And this is called <HI>DAEMONOLOGY.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) This Science proceeds, by Analogy from what Powers &amp; Perfections we find in our &s;elves (removing all Defects and Limitations,) to explain what we are capable of Knowing concerning the Being, Na|ture, Attributes &amp; Operations of GOD, the Supreme, All wi&s;e and Almighty Spirit who hath made, pre|&s;erves and Governs all things, both in the Natural &amp; Moral World; being here di&s;covered to be the im|mediate Efficient and Author of all the <HI>phaenomena</HI> of Nature, in who&s;e Eternal, All comprehending Mind are the Archetypes of our Ideas, and who is the Great Original and Father of our Spirits, and con&s;equently our chief Good; and our Supreme King and Moral Governor, and therefore infinitely Wi&s;e, Ju&s;t &amp; Be|nevolent in all his Conduct towards us; to whom we mu&s;t give an Account of all our Actions, and by whom we &s;hall be mo&s;t righteou&s;ly and equitably dealt with hereafter, and be either Rewarded or Pu|ni&s;hed, in exact proportion, according as our Behaviour &s;hall be found to have been good or bad in this Life.

The <HI>Practical part</HI> of <HI>Moral philo&s;ophy,</HI> from the Truths di&s;covered concerning GOD &amp; Created Spirits in the <HI>Speculative</HI> part of it, infers the Rules of our Duty &amp; Behaviour, and teaches us &s;o to live and con|duct our &s;elves upon all Occa&s;ions as will render us truly Happy both here and for ever. &mdash; And here Mankind mu&s;t be con&s;idered in a twofold Capacity; viz either as a <HI>Moral Sy&s;tem</HI> in general, or as &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing in <HI>particular Society's.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1) That which re&s;pects mankind as a <HI>Moral Sy&s;tem</HI> in general, is called <HI>ETHICS</HI> or Morality, which is defined, The Art of Living happily by the practice of <HI>Vertue,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in that force and &s;tability of Soul whereby we do firmly per&s;i&s;t in chu&s;ing &amp; doing whatever Truth &amp; Right Rea&s;on dictate as nece&s;&s;ary to be cho&s;en &amp; done in order to our true Happine&s;s, in &s;pight of all Temptations to the Contrary.</P>
<P>This I have called <HI>Moral Good,</HI> which is here to be con&s;idered, not only as founded in the Truth and Nature of things, but al&s;o as being the Will &amp; Law of GOD concerning us, and con&s;equently what we are Obliged to do in Obedience to his Will and from a &s;en&s;e of Duty to him&punc; For we are here to con&s;ider our &s;elves as a Moral Sy&s;tem acting under the Eye of Al|mighty GOD &amp; Accountable to Him as our Supreme King &amp; Moral Governour, who&s;e Will and Law it therefore is, that we &s;hould thus behave our &s;elves, becau&s;e he would have us happy. For being perfectly Happy him&s;elf and Self &s;ufficient to his own Happi|ne&s;s, He could have (no Selfi&s;h Views,) no other View in Creating &amp; Governing the Moral World, than that it might be, in the whole, a happy Sy&s;tem: &mdash; Since therefore He would have us Happy, it mu&s;t be his Will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Law that we &s;hould conform all our Tem|pers

and Behaviour to Truth &amp; Right Rea&s;on, becau&s;e &s;uch a Conduct. is, in the Nature of things nece&s;&s;ary to our true Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>So that there are two things to be here Con&s;idered, viz. The <HI>Criterion</HI> of <HI>Right</HI> &amp; <HI>Wrong,</HI> and the <HI>Obliga|tion</HI> we are under to practice the One &amp; avoid the Other. &mdash; The <HI>Criterion</HI> of <HI>Right</HI> &amp; <HI>Wrong,</HI> is the <HI>Truth</HI> &amp; <HI>Nature</HI> of things or their <HI>Fitne&s;s</HI> in the whole to promote our True Happine&s;s. &mdash; And the <HI>Obligation</HI> we are under to practice accordingly is two fold, <HI>Internal</HI> &amp; <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>External</HI> &amp; <HI>Moral.</HI> The <HI>Internal</HI> &amp; <HI>Natural Obligation</HI> we are under to the practice of Vertue is that great Law of our Nature, whereby we are Obliged to &s;eek our own Pre&s;ervation and Happine&s;s. &mdash; And the <HI>External</HI> &amp; <HI>Moral Ob|ligation</HI> is the Con&s;ideration that it is the Will &amp; Law of a Superior to whom we are Accountable. &mdash;And this is either <HI>Political</HI> or <HI>Religious</HI> &mdash; The <HI>Political Obligation</HI> is the Con&s;ideration that it is the Public Will, or the Law of the Society to which we belong. &mdash; And the <HI>Religious Obligation,</HI> which is here e&s;pecially to be regarded, is the Con&s;ideration that it is the Will and Law of GOD concerning us, to whom we are Accountable for all our Behaviour.</P>
<P><HI>ETHICS,</HI> therefore, or true <HI>Morality</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the Practice of what&s;oever is nece&s;&s;ary to our Happi|ne&s;s in Obedience to the Will of GOD: And con|&s;equently it mu&s;t pre&s;cribe all the Rules of upright and vertuous Behaviour in all the Relations wherein we &s;tand, whether with regard to <HI>GOD,</HI> our <HI>Selves,</HI> or our <HI>Neighbour.</HI></P>
