<HEAD>THE Exaimner, Examined, OR GILBERT TENNENT, HARMONIOUS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;trange to think how the mo&s;t generous and noble Actions, thro' the Force of &s;ome Craft and Artifice, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with Prejudice and Fal&s;hood, may be repre&s;ented in the darke&s;t Dre&s;s, as if they were Vices of the mo&s;t &s;ordid kind.</P>
<P>Seeing I am called to &s;peak in my own Defence, I hope the Reader will excu&s;e my &s;aying as follows, <HI>Viz.</HI> That I never undertook any Thing with a deeper Sen&s;e of my own Weakne&s;s, and a Sincerer Intention, to God's Glory and his Kingdoms Good; then my Journey to <HI>New-England:</HI> And never un|derwent &s;uch hard&s;hips by Rea&s;on of the inten&s;e Cold, frequent Travel, and continual Labours as there. So that I am like to feels the Effects thereof to my Death, having thereby contracted a hardne&s;s of hearing, with other bodily Di&s;orders. But that which Comforts me under tho&s;e Infirmitys is this, that the Eternal God was vi&s;ibly with me in that Journey, in &s;ealing my Labours with &s;urprizing and manifold Succe&s;&s;es, (GLORY to his Name) in the <HI>Conviction</HI> and <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of many Sinners to GOD; which &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent for <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> have already born ex|pre&s;s Te&s;timony to, and many Thou&s;ands more can.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005297_0004_1016F5345F95C8F0">But behold the Reward our Anonymous Author is plea&s;ed to confer unpon me, and that under the gui&s;e of CHARITY, is <HI>ridicule, &s;lander,</HI> and <HI>in|vective.</HI> What, could not his Charity extend to &s;peak one favourable Word of that Journey, for which &s;o many have with good Rea&s;on prai&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ed GOD? It &s;eems not! However, it is my Support and Solace under all that load of Calumny, that is ca&s;t upon me by the Oppo&s;ers of GOD'S WORK, that Faithfulne&s;s to God and Succe&s;s in his Service, will appear in their own proper Light ano|ther Day.</P>
<P>It is no new Thing for the Servants of God to be traduc'd and repre&s;ented as the Off-&s;couring of the Earth. Neither is it unu&s;ual for his Work to be cover'd with <HI>Scandal</HI> and <HI>Contempt,</HI> and a&s;crib'd to a bad Cau&s;e: And con&s;idering the native Enmity of the Unregenerate again&s;t God and Goodne&s;s, and the Multitude of &s;uch that are in the World of e|very Order, we needn't be &s;urpriz'd at &s;uch Events.</P>
<P>If we will approve our&s;elves Di&s;ciples of CHRIST indeed, we mu&s;t expect to bear his Cro&s;s: And truly, according to the common Cour&s;e of Things, the more exten&s;ive Good we are enabled to do, we mu&s;t expect to bear the more Reproach. What tho' we be &s;ound in Principle, Sincere in Heart, and La|borious in Life to promote CHRIST'S Kingdom, yet with the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and other primitive Servants of God, we &s;hall be look'd upon as <HI>deceivers, di&s;turbers</HI> of the Peace and <HI>di&s;orderly</HI> Per&s;ons. For as it was of old &s;o it is now, <HI>He that was Born after the Fle&s;h, pre&s;ecuted him that was Born after the Spirit.</HI> Did not <HI>Cain</HI> hate his Brother <HI>Abel,</HI> becau&s;e his own Deeds were Evil and his Brothers Righteous? And has not our Lord told us, that <HI>We &s;hall be hated, becau&s;e we are not of the World?</HI> It is true ungodly Per&s;ons in every Age, cover and colour their &s;ordid Oppo|&s;ition to goodne&s;s and u&s;efulne&s;s, with artful and plau&s;ible Apoligy's, to prevent the Odium, that wou'd otherwi&s;e ju&s;tly fall upon their Character.
<PB N="5" REF="005297_0005_1016F539802389A8">
They pretend Di&s;orders in Conduct, and Error in Principle, are the Grounds thereof; but if &s;o, why don't they exert their Zeal again&s;t &s;uch Evils, as well as Impieties of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Kind, which are flagrant in the Practice of &s;ome of their Brethren? No, &s;uch Things, becau&s;e of the Relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, are pa&s;t over with &s;ilence and negli|gence! While the Vertues of good Men, are put in the Dre&s;s of the mo&s;t crim&s;on Impietys, &amp; their minu|te&s;t Foibles agravated by the Force of Sophi&s;try, into ma&s;&s;y Mountains; as well as the mo&s;t Fal&s;e and in|vidious Charges invented and propogated, to de|&s;troy their Characters and U&s;efulne&s;s at a Stroke! But the true Cau&s;e of all the mighty Bu&s;tle, which is rais'd in every period of Time, again&s;t the Work and Servants of God, is indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed, and that is, the Native Enmity of natural Men, of every Tribe and Order again&s;t God and Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, &s;eeing the Ca&s;e is &s;o, we mu&s;t therefore with Courage and Patience, follow our deare&s;t Lord, thro' <HI>good Report</HI> and <HI>bad Report,</HI> and con&s;ider him <HI>who endur'd the Contradiction of Sinners again&s;t him&s;elf, lea&s;t we be weary and Faint in our Minds.</HI> The Com|munications of our Ma&s;ter's Love to us, and the Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own integrity, together with the believing Expectation of that exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, which is &s;et before us, does and will &s;weeten all the Sorrows of our State of Pil|grimage! And therefore we may An&s;wer the ca|lumnious Oppo&s;ers as <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> the threatning Me&s;|&s;age of the Empre&s;s <HI>Eudoxia, that we fear nothing but Sin. (nil ni&s;i peccatum timeo.)</HI></P>
<P>I am not di&s;turbed at the Author of this Pamphlet, for examining my Sentiments and Conduct, if either of them upon an impartial Tryal, be found cen&s;ur|able, let them be condemned in the mo&s;t open Man|ner. But I tru&s;t it will appear by what follows, to every intelligent and impartial Reader, that the Method this Gentleman has us'd in the Compo&s;ure of his <HI>Examiner,</HI> is exceptionable and partial. I hope
<PB N="6" REF="005297_0006_1016F53B07058BE0">
I may &s;ay to the Glory of God, without the Im|putation of vain Boa&s;ting, that I am &s;o indifferent for the mo&s;t Part, re&s;pecting the Opinion of the World, as to my Per&s;on and Performances, and &s;o fully convinced of the Vanity, both of the Prai&s;es and Cen&s;ures, of the mo&s;t of Mankind, that I &s;hould have given my&s;elf no Trouble to oppo&s;e the nume|rous Falacies of this Performance, had I not been convinc'd that it was my Duty to appear now in the ju&s;t Vindication of Gods Work and Servants, which are therein traduc'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Examiner</HI> offers &s;ome A&s;per&s;ions concerning my Journey to <HI>New-England,</HI> which I know in my Con&s;cience to be Fal&s;e, which being per&s;onal I tho't I was under a greater Advantage to detect.</P>
<P>I am engag'd in other Work for God, from which I am with &s;ome degree of Reluctance di|verted by thorny Controver&s;y, but herein I mu&s;t deny my &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Candid Reader,</HI> I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve <HI>(en pa&s;|&s;ent)</HI> that our Ca&s;e of late and at pre&s;ent, (in this Country) re&s;pecting the Promotion of vital Reli|gion, &s;eems very much to re&s;emble that of <HI>Nehemi|ah,</HI> and the other Builders of the Wall of <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> who were much oppos'd and &s;omewhat interrupted in their Work, by the unrea&s;onable Fury and low Arts of <HI>Sanbal|lat,</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates, who &s;coff'd at, and rag'd again&s;t the Builders, as well as rais'd fal&s;e Reports re&s;pecting their De&s;ign and Conduct. It is report|ed among the Heathen &s;aid they, and <HI>Ga&s;hmu</HI> &s;ay|eth it, <HI>that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cau&s;e thou builde&s;t the Wall:</HI> They likewi&s;e endea|vour'd to en&s;nare them by Craft, and enter'd into a dete&s;table Con&s;piracy to &s;top the Progre&s;s of the Work! May we who are thro' pure Grace upon God's Side, be enabled to follow <HI>Nehemiah</HI>'s Ex|ample, in &s;upplicating Heaven in this Immergen|cy, and we may hope for the fini&s;hing of the Wall, notwith&s;tanding all that the Oppo&s;ers have done,
<PB N="7" REF="005297_0007_1016F53CE2020E00">
or can do, and &s;eeing we are encompa&s;s'd with Enemy's of various Forms, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Prophane, Formali&s;ts, Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Hereticks,</HI> let us with tho&s;e primitive Builders work in the Wall with one Hand, and hold a Weapon in the other. See <HI>Neh.</HI> 1.2.4. &amp; 6. chap.</P>
<P>But to come nearer to the Subject of our pre|&s;ent Enquirys, I can &s;afely declare, that I have read this <HI>Examiner</HI>'s Performance, as well as o|thers of like nature &s;et out by my Opponents, with a willingne&s;s to be convinced of Error in Princi|ple or Practice, if I was guilty of either, and with a Re&s;olution to acknowledge them publickly, if I found the Ca&s;e &s;o. For I think that Maxim is mo&s;t ju&s;t <HI>viz. fas e&s;t, et ab ho&s;te doceri, It is lawful to be in&s;tructed even by an Enemy.</HI> And a Confe&s;&s;i|on of Errors in Judgment, or Evils in Practice, is certainly a Debt we owe to Truth and Piety. But after the mo&s;t calm and impartial Enquirys I am capable of making, I have not met with Con|viction by their Arguments, or rather Reflections, unle&s;s it be of the Fal&s;ehood and Inju&s;tice of their Charges, the badne&s;s of their Cau&s;e, and the ma|lignity of their Way of managing it.</P>
<P>In particular I leave it to the Readers Judgment, whether the <HI>Examiner</HI> has not acted a di&s;ingenuous Part in his labouring to expo&s;e my Name to con|tempt, while in the mean Time he conceals his own. Let him ask his own Con&s;cience, whether he has done in this, <HI>as he would be done by?</HI> Is this the Charity, which he &s;ays he put on in his fir&s;t Page, then truly it is a very &s;elfi&s;h Stamp, for it both begins and ends at home?</P>
<P>Here let me ob&s;erve, that I cannot but admire that a Per&s;on of our Authors Penetration, &s;hould make &s;o gro&s;s a Blunder in the Choice of his Name, why &s;hould he call him&s;elf <HI>Philalethes</HI> or <HI>a lover of Truth,</HI> while he makes it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to confute his Name, by his Practice in this Performance, to which it is prefixed? The repeated Fal&s;hoods
<PB N="8" REF="005297_0008_1016F540720DCC08">
with which his labour'd Sheets are &s;tuff'd, &s;uit bet|ter, as I humbly conceive, a contrary Name and Character, namely <HI>Mi&s;alethes,</HI> or <HI>a hater of Truth;</HI> but the be&s;t Apology I can make for our Author, is that his Name is not proper but feign'd, and that perhaps his De&s;ign was better than his Per|formance, po&s;&s;ibly he might be lead into &s;ome Mi&s;takes, by Mi&s;information, Incon&s;ideration, or by the force of Prejudice and Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But to proceed, the <HI>Examiner</HI> tells us in the Be|ginning of his Performance, <Q>When I had read Mr. <HI>G. Tennent</HI>'s three fir&s;t Sermons, on <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.3. repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of holding fa&s;t the Truth, with the Appendix, relating to the <HI>Mo|ravian</HI> Errors, &amp;c. I immediately reviewed and compar'd them with his famous Sermon preach'd at <HI>Notingham, upon the Danger of an unconverted Mi|ni&s;try,</HI> on <HI>Mark</HI> 16.44. and mu&s;t confe&s;s, it is as impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile them upon Principles of common Sen&s;e, as to unite the two Poles.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Were I of this Gentleman's Opinion, I wou'd immediately retract, in the mo&s;t open Man|ner; but being per&s;waded that there is no im|po&s;&s;ibility in the Matter. I &s;hall therefore e&s;&s;ay to &s;hew the Harmony that is between them, by con|&s;idering what our Author has &s;aid to the con|trary.</P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;omething odd, that immediately after the <HI>Examiner</HI> had put on as he tells us (<HI>Pag.</HI> 1.) <HI>Charity which is not ea&s;ily provok'd, and hopeth all Things;</HI> that he &s;hould u&s;e &s;uch Terms of Contempt as the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>And becau&s;e it &s;eems hard for a <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> to confe&s;s his Errors once a Year, tho' he may love to be Father Confe&s;&s;or him&s;elf, and bring others to the Stool.</Q> It &s;eems by what has been &s;aid, that the Cloak was not but|ton'd very clo&s;e upon him; whether this Gentle|man be a Mini&s;ter or not, which he di&s;dainfully terms High Prie&s;t, perhaps not only to give vent to his Prejudice, but the better to conceal him|&s;elf.
<PB N="9" REF="005297_0009_1016F544618FCFE8">
I know not, but methinks he might have at pre&s;ent wav'd his &s;arca&s;tical Fleer about bring|ing others to the Stool, while this very Thing is, at lea&s;t in Pretence, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his pre&s;ent Performance; which is like to fail of Succe&s;s, for the want of a ju&s;t Foundation. But whether, when our Author reads the ju&s;t Charges that are offer'd again&s;t his Conduct, in the following Pages, he will like to be brought to the Stool him&s;elf and make publick Retractations with <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> according to his own Advice to me, <HI>pag.</HI> 31. Time mu&s;t di&s;|cover?</P>
<P>As to the reprinting of my <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> I had no hand in it, but if I had, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on that I &s;hould have to repent of &s;uch an Action. I have not &s;een that Sermon for a con|&s;iderable Time, before the other Day, but hearing &s;o many Outcries again&s;t it; I was induc'd to read it over and over, with calmne&s;s to &s;ee if there was a Foundation for the mighty Oppo&s;ition made again&s;t it; but upon enquiry I could not but think that as to the Matter and Sub&s;tance of it, it was but <HI>the naked Truth,</HI> and &s;uch as, if fairly repre&s;ent|ed, all its Adver&s;aries will never be able to confute.</P>
<P>But why does this Author, bring in the Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> upon this Occa&s;ion; &s;eeing that many Thou&s;ands have approv'd of the Sermon as well as he, doubtle&s;s it was to expo&s;e him to contempt among the Ungodly; becau&s;e that Ser|mon has much irritated natural Mini&s;ters and Peo|ple?</P>
<P>Since Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> (&s;ays he) has judged it an unan&s;werable Piece.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It appears to be &s;o yet, notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid again&s;t it. The <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> in their third Part, which is level'd again&s;t this Ser|mon, expre&s;s as little regard to Truth, and Mo|de&s;ty, as to Religion and fair Rea&s;oning; they ap|pear to be Men of a wild and luxuriant Turn of Thought, who are di&s;po&s;ed to deride and burle&s;que
<PB N="10" REF="005297_0010_1016F5475ECDD188">
with prophane irreverence, what is mo&s;t &s;acred and &s;erious; and therefore what they offer in their Performance, hardly de&s;erves any Notice from &s;uch as are inclined to Truth, Sobriety, and Re|ligion. And had not the afore&s;aid gloomy Ingre|dients been frequent and flagrant in their Writings, they would have been long &s;ince replied to. But it is an uncomfortable Task to deal with Men that will hardly &s;tick at any Thing. In &s;hort the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> Compo&s;ure upon which the <HI>Examiner</HI> lays &s;o great a Stre&s;s, in his pre&s;ent Performance, is but a Voluminous Bundle of confident Imperti|nence, and rude Billing&s;gate, wherein the true State of the Que&s;tion is perverted. To make this evident, I would ob&s;erve that the two Particulars in the Sermon again&s;t which their Rea&s;onings would &s;eem principally to turn, are the&s;e <HI>viz.</HI> 1. what I have &s;aid in the 7. <HI>pag.</HI> concerning natu|ral Men, that they have no Call of God to the mini&s;terial Work, under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation. And 2. What I have &s;aid from <HI>pag.</HI> 18. to 29. re&s;pecting Per&s;ons going &s;tatedly from hearing one Mini&s;ter to another, for greater good. What they have offer'd again&s;t me concerning tho&s;e Par|ticulars, are the main Pillars of that Performance, which if they be over&s;et, the whole Fabrick falls.</P>
<P>Here let the <HI>Reader</HI> ob&s;erve, that the Plan I went upon in the Sermon, and A&s;&s;ertion afore&s;aid, was this <HI>viz.</HI> that there is a two fold Call to the Mini|&s;try, <HI>inward</HI> and <HI>outward</HI> the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ting princi|pally in, or rather evidenced by the pious Di&s;po&s;iti|ons, and Aims of the Per&s;on, and the latter in his regular external Separation to the Mini&s;terial Work. It is evident from the Words of that Pa|ragraph, that I meant the <HI>inward</HI> Call.&mdash;The Words are the&s;e, <Q>Is it not a Principal Part, of the ordinary Call of God to the mini&s;terial Work, to aim at the Glory of God, and in Sub|ordination thereto, the good of Souls; as their chief Marks, in their Undertaking that Work.</Q>
<PB N="11" REF="005297_0011_1016F54AED136208">
I cannot be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to mean the ex|ternal Call, by the afore&s;aid Words, except I was intirely void of common Sen&s;e, and &s;o unable to di&s;tingui&s;h between what is <HI>outward</HI> and <HI>inward.</HI> But &s;urely the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> didn't take me to be <HI>non com|pos,</HI> otherwi&s;e they have reflected upon their own Under&s;tandings, by writing &s;o much again&s;t me, and yet the <HI>Queri&s;ts,</HI> have di&s;ingenuou&s;ly apply'd them to the <HI>outward Call,</HI> and &s;o mi&s;repre&s;ented my meaning, and the true State of the Que&s;tion, <HI>pag.</HI> 44. in their 5. Que&s;tion, they &s;ignify, <Q>what they take to be the <HI>Call</HI> of God to the Mini&s;try, and &s;ay that it is &s;ome publick and authoritative Declaration, of Gods Will, &amp;c.</Q> Which plain|ly &s;hews that they mean the <HI>external</HI> or <HI>outward</HI> Call only. And in the following Paragraph, they &s;ay in an&s;wer to my Que&s;tion in the Sermon, namely, <HI>Is it not a principal Part of the ordinary Call of God to the Mini&s;terial Work, to aim at Gods Glory, and in Subordination thereto the Good of Souls?</HI> They an&s;wer, <HI>That it is no Part of Gods Call to the Mini&s;try, much le&s;s a principal Part of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It's true, it is no Part of the <HI>external</HI> Call; here they endeavour to repre&s;ent me, as maintain|ing, that the afore&s;aid good Di&s;po&s;ition, gives Au|thority to exerci&s;e the Mini&s;try; which was ever far from my Thoughts, and which there is not one Word of in that Sermon, which they &s;et them|&s;elves to oppo&s;e. What I have &s;aid re&s;pecting the <HI>inward</HI> Call they apply to the <HI>outward</HI> and thus they mi&s;repre&s;ent, and mi&s;apply, what I have &s;poken, and &s;o do not rea&s;on again&s;t my Opinion chiefly but their own Mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>That my <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon was fram'd upon the Plan or Notion of a two fold Call, will ap|pear more clearly by comparing what has been already mentioned, from the 7 <HI>pag.</HI> of that Ser|mon, with what is &s;aid <HI>pag.</HI> 31. where I ob&s;eve that <Q><HI>Phari&s;aick,</HI> or unconverted Mini&s;ters are no Shepherds, (no faithful Ones) in CHRIST'S Ac|count.</Q>
<PB N="12" REF="005297_0012_1016F54ED88AD640">
There it is plainly intimated, that I own'd them to be Mini&s;ters, true and lawful ones in the &s;ight of the Church, but not faithful ones in the Account of CHRIST. Yea the Ca&s;e is &s;o plain, that the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> them&s;elves do acknow|ledge it, <HI>pag.</HI> 55. in the&s;e Words, <Q>doth it not &s;eems that the vulgar Di&s;tinction, between the <HI>out|ward</HI> and <HI>inward</HI> Call, the Call of God and the Call of Man to the Mini&s;try, is the Foundati|on of the above Mi&s;take in Mr. <HI>T.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But tho' the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> deny the afore&s;aid Aim, &amp;c. to be any Part of the Call of God to the Mini&s;try; yet they own it to be a Qualification requi&s;ite in the Per&s;ons call'd, to render them fit, for the Work they are call'd to <HI>pag.</HI> 55. <HI>que&s;t</HI> 6. <Q>Whence then doth this Confu&s;ion in which Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> &s;eems to labour, ari&s;e? Doth it not proceed from his jumbling and mixing many Things together, which are of a quite different Nature and Order, as if they were one and the &s;ame Thing? For doth not he confound the authoritative Call, Commi&s;&s;ion or Command of God, which is the divine Act, either immediate|ly or mediately, with the Qualifications requi&s;ite in the Per&s;ons called, to render them fit for the Work they are called to, as if they were the &s;elf &s;ame Thing?</Q></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No! I have not confounded them, I have never &s;aid nor tho't that any Per&s;on, by rea&s;on of his good Di&s;po&s;itions or Aims, had Commi&s;&s;i|on or Authority, to exerci&s;e the mini&s;terial Office. And do not the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> contradict them&s;elves in this Charge? While they el&s;ewhere own as I have already ob&s;erv'd, <Q>that the vulgar Di&s;tincti|on between the <HI>outward</HI> and <HI>inward</HI> Call, was the Foundation of my Mi&s;take.</Q> How could I di&s;|tingui&s;h them, and yet confound them? But here let it be ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> do own the Unfitne&s;s of natural Men for the Mini&s;terial Of|fice, which was the principal Thing I de&s;ign'd to
<PB N="13" REF="005297_0013_1016BA3B0FF9AD08">
prove in the <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon. And what if I had given a wrong Name, to what is acknowledg|ed by them&s;elves to be nece&s;&s;ary, why would they make me &s;o great an Offender for a Word? <HI>Under</HI> this <HI>Con&s;ideration,</HI> what is their Debate but a meer <HI>Logomachy?</HI></P>
<P>It is true, I did not &s;o fully and expre&s;sly ex|plain my Propo&s;ition, in the 7. <HI>pag.</HI> as I might have done, and this is all the Shadow for caviling upon the Call to the Mini&s;try, which the <HI>Que|ri&s;ts,</HI> probably to an&s;wer &s;ome private De&s;ign, have us'd all the Arts of Sophi&s;try in improving; but it is plain to any that read that Sermon with Attention, that in con&s;equence of the afore&s;aid Di&s;tinction of an <HI>outward</HI> and an <HI>inward</HI> Call, I di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween true and faithful Mini&s;ters. See <HI>pag.</HI> 31. where it is &s;aid, <Q>there is no probability (<HI>i. e.</HI> as to many of them) of getting good, by the Mi|ni&s;try of <HI>Phari&s;ees:</HI> For they are no Shepherds (no faithful ones) in Chri&s;ts Account.</Q> Tho&s;e that have an <HI>outward</HI> Call only, may be &s;aid to be true Mini&s;ters in the Sight of the Church, their Mini&s;trations are valid, yea they may be &s;aid to be true Mini&s;ters <HI>in the Sight of God in this Re&s;pect,</HI> namely, that they come into the Mini&s;try <HI>ac|cording to the Rules or Orders,</HI> which God has appoint|ed in his Church; But they cannot be &s;aid to be faithful Ones, &s;eeing they have no Faith.&mdash;If they are not faithful in the Affairs of their own Souls, how can they be &s;uppos'd to be faithful in the Affairs of others?</P>
<P>Now when I &s;ay in that Sermon, that uncon|verted Men are not &s;ent of God into the Mini|&s;try, under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, I mean the&s;e Things following, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. that they are de&s;titute of an Aim at Gods Glory above all, and other pi|ous Di&s;po&s;itions, without which they are not well qualified for the Mini&s;terial Work; and therefore (comparatively at lea&s;t) are unlikely to do much good in it. And 2. I do not find under the Go&s;|pel
<PB N="14" REF="005297_0014_1016F55075371F88">
Di&s;pen&s;ation, that unconverted Men are mov'd or inclin'd by the Spirit of God to undertake the mini&s;terial Office, but by their own or by a wor&s;e Spirit. And 3. that Almighty God does not re|quire in his Word, nor approve of, unconverted Men taking upon them the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;|pel; the&s;e Things the Scriptures and Rea&s;onings in the Sermon plainly prove; and indeed &s;uch as oppo&s;e them, oppo&s;e the true Intere&s;t of vital Godline&s;s, which are not like to be well pro|moted without a pious Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The anonymous <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> betray a bad Temper of Mind, in their labouring to enervate, what I have &s;aid in the afore&s;aid Sermon, re&s;pecting the Un|comfortablene&s;s of the Mini&s;try of natural Men to gracious Souls; herein they oppo&s;e the com|mon Sen&s;e of the Faithful; and in their cavil|ing at what is offer'd in the Sermon, concerning the unprofitablene&s;s of the Mini&s;try of gracele&s;s Men, for the mo&s;t Part; in re&s;pect of the Con|viction and Conver&s;ion of Sinners, they not only manife&s;t an evil Di&s;po&s;ition, but contradict the plaine&s;t Te&s;timony's of Scripture and Experience. The&s;e Things are &s;o &s;elf evident, that it is ama|zing to find profe&s;&s;ors of Religion oppo&s;ing them.</P>
<P>Is not this the plain Tendency of the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> rea&s;oning upon this Head? Namely, to encourage ungodly Men to take upon them the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel, as well as to encourage People to an indifferency in their Choice of Mini&s;ters, and are not both the&s;e Things fatal to the Church of God, &s;hould not Extreams be avoided on every Hand?</P>
<P>That there is an <HI>outward</HI> and an <HI>inward</HI> Call to the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, is a&s;&s;erted by many Di|vines of principal Note, among the reformed Church|es; to this Effect &s;pake the Rev. Me&s;&s; <HI>Durham</HI> and <HI>Bracle.</HI> Mr. <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> in his <HI>Pan&s;ebia</HI> repre&s;ents this to be the Opinion of all the <HI>Pre&s;byterians;</HI> and in|deed I thought it had been &s;o too, till I met with
<PB N="15" REF="005297_0015_1016F5525FCC84A8">
the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> Performance, which is done by Per|&s;ons who are fond of that Name. I could wi&s;h for their own Sakes, that they were as fond of the Thing &s;ignify'd by it, in this as well as in other Particulars. But the Ca&s;e is &s;o plain, re&s;pecting the Di&s;tinction of an <HI>outward</HI> and an <HI>inward</HI> Call to the Mini&s;try, being held by many; That the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> them&s;elves are forc'd to confe&s;s its Ve|racity. <HI>pag.</HI> 55. <HI>que&s;t.</HI> 7. <Q>Doth it not &s;eem, that the imbibing and improving the fal&s;e tho' vulgar Di&s;tinction between the <HI>outward</HI> and <HI>inward</HI> Call, the Call of God and the Call of Man to the Mi|ni&s;try, is the Foundation of the above Mi&s;take in Mr <HI>T?</HI></Q> Here they own it to be vulgar, <HI>or com|monly received;</HI> and indeed &s;o it is; for this is the Opinion of the whole Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as appears from her Directory, which they and we have a|dopted, as the Standard of our Proceedings and Sentiments, re&s;pecting the Affairs of Church Go|vernment. Under the Head of Ordination, are the&s;e Words, <Q>Which being con&s;idered by the Presbytery they &s;hall proceed to enquire touch|ing the Grace of God in him, and whether he be of &s;uch holine&s;s of Life, as is requi&s;ite in a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and to examine him, touching his Learning and Sufficiency, and touch|ing the Evidences of his calling to the Holy Mini&s;try; and in particular his fair and direct calling to that Place.</Q> Here it is evident, that they a&s;&s;ert a Call to the Mini&s;try, before Ordina|tion; and therefore an <HI>inward</HI> Call. This is writ|ten as with a Sun Beam in tho&s;e Words, and therefore the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> &s;hew either little acquaint|ance with their own avowed Principles, or little regard to them, by denying it. And indeed here|by they offer much Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect their Sin|cerity in the Mini&s;try. Alas what &s;uperficial Mi|ni&s;ters mu&s;t they be, who deny the <HI>inward</HI> Call, is it becau&s;e they han't it them&s;elves, or is it to run down with the Cry of <HI>Error, Error,</HI> &s;uch as
<PB N="16" REF="005297_0016_1016F55411F15E58">
think it nece&s;&s;ary to hold the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Princi|ples contain'd in our excellent Directory? If &s;o their Ca&s;e or Cour&s;e is mi&s;erable. And do not the Church of England in their Ordination Office, propo&s;e the&s;e Que&s;tions to the Candidate, before Or|dination, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Do you tru&s;t that you are <HI>inwardly</HI> moved by the Holy Gho&s;t to take upon you this Office and Admini&s;tration? And are you called according to the Will of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Laws of this Realm?</Q> This is &s;o plain and po&s;itive to the Point in di&s;pute, that there is no need of any Addition to explain it. The <HI>Reader</HI> may herefrom ea&s;ily perceive, what &s;ort of a Spirit the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> are of, who labour to ca&s;t Contempt upon the avowed Principles of the <HI>Body</HI> of the Prote&s;tant Churches, re&s;pecting this Point under debate.</P>
<P>Now &s;eeing I did not a&s;&s;ert the Nece&s;&s;ity of an extraordinary Call, in the ordinary Times of the Go&s;pel; con&s;i&s;ting in Vi&s;ions, and Voices and the like, or that good Di&s;po&s;itions and Aims, were &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a Mini&s;ter, or give a Right to exerci&s;e that Office, without a regular external Separation thereto, according to the Order of God, neither of which, I ever believ'd or expre&s;s'd; what nece&s;&s;ity was there then for &s;o long and warm a Di&s;pute, again&s;t our and their excellent Directory, unle&s;s it was to amu&s;e the Ignorant, and prejudice them again&s;t tho&s;e whom they hated, and wanted to pull down?</P>
<P>But the Truth of the Ca&s;e is this, &s;ome of the&s;e Men have been le&s;s e&s;teemed, by &s;ome of their Hearers, after the Work of God &s;pread among them, than before; and others whom they di&s;lik'd have been e&s;teem'd above them; neither of which they could brook, they have therefore taken up Arms again&s;t Gods Work and his Servants, whom he has us'd in promoting it, and have endeavour'd by all Means, <HI>(per fas ne&s;a&s;&abque;)</HI> by Hook and Crook to &s;lander and traduce both, in order to amu&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="005297_0017_1016F55965CE2960">
the ignorant Populace, they have rais'd the <HI>Hue and Cry</HI> of <HI>Error</HI> and <HI>Di&s;order,</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e whom they di&s;dain, and have put their Wits upon the Tenters, to find out Matter to &s;upport the Charge, partly by invidious and fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es, upon the Writings of their Opponents, and by artfully magnifying &s;mal|ler Indi&s;cretions in Conduct, and partly by either Inventing or Propagating notorious Fal&s;hoods concerning them.</P>
<P>That God, who&s;e we are, and whom we &s;erve, knows, that it was our Intention in travelling to bring poor Sinners to CHRIST JESUS, as well as to build up Saints in him, and not to divide Congrega|tions, as they do fal&s;ly Charge us, it is they that are the proper Cau&s;es of the Divi&s;ions among us, by their oppo&s;ing that ble&s;&s;ed Work of Conviction and Conver&s;ion, that has not long &s;ince been &s;preading in their Borders! Had they join'd with us as they ought to have done, in promoting that Work, and as they will wi&s;h one Day they had done, there would have been no Divi&s;ions among us: But in&s;tead of this, they have us'd &s;ly and &s;ophi&s;tical Methods, in abu&s;ing every &s;eemingly or really exceptionable Incident, to ca&s;t odious Colours upon the whole Work, they have likewi&s;e oppos'd God's Work, by their fal&s;e and dangerous <HI>Moravian</HI> Doctrine, about Conviction. Witne&s;s, Mr. <HI>Thomp&s;ons</HI> dete&s;ta|ble and incon&s;i&s;tent Performance, entitled, <HI>The Doctrine of Convictions &s;et in a clear Light;</HI> which divers Mini&s;ters of that &s;chi&s;matical Party, have ex|pre&s;&s;ed their Appobation of: Hardly any thing can be invented, that has a more direct Tendency, to de&s;troy the common Operations of God's holy Spi|rit, and to keep Men from JESUS CHRIST, than what Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> has expre&s;s'd in that Performance.</P>
<P>C. E. G. <HI>pag.</HI> 2.7. He &s;ays, <Q>Fir&s;t, as to the&s;e pre|paratory ungracious Convictions, as I may call them, which are held to be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, by way of Pre|paration for Conver&s;ion. I apprehend that if their Nature and Tendency be duly con&s;idered, it will
<PB N="18" REF="005297_0018_1016BA385CB32330">
appear, that all &s;uch Convictions, as are void of true Grace, are &s;o far from being nece&s;&s;ary Pre|paratives for Conver&s;ion, that they, are rather an Impediment to it. <HI>Pag.</HI> 28. That the&s;e common Convictions may be &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded with true Conver&s;ion, I do not deny, but when it is &s;o, the Conver&s;ion following cannot be ju&s;tly reckon'd the proper Effect of the&s;e Convictions, altho' it may be occa&s;ion'd by them, as it may be by the Commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome gro&s;s Sin, which deeply wounds the natural Con&s;cience. <HI>Pag</HI> 33.34. It is evident that whatever Convictions, may be rais'd in a Per&s;ons Mind, which are void of the foregoing Marks of &s;aving Conviction, or whatever Fear or Terrors may follow or accom|pany &s;uch Convictions, can have no native Ten|dency, to lead or prepare Per&s;ons for Conver&s;i|on. What nearer to Conver&s;ion is a Per&s;on, or better prepar'd for it, by his being convinc'd of Sin and Guilt, while &s;till his Heart, Love and Affections are under the reigning Power of it? Nor is he humbly affected, with a Sen&s;e of its Vilene&s;s. How much was <HI>Judas</HI> prepar'd for Con|ver&s;ion by his Convictions and Terrors? Yea &s;uch ungracious Convictions tend rather to &s;care a Per&s;on from Chri&s;t, than draw him unto him: <HI>pag.</HI> 39. From which it doth plainly ap|pear, that the Convictions which are nece&s;&s;ary to Conver&s;ion, are in Truth a Part of the Work it &s;elf, or to &s;peak more di&s;tinctly, nothing el&s;e, but that very Principle of Grace, implanted in and by Conver&s;ion; puting forth it &s;elf in the Exerci&s;e of Conviction, or Per&s;ua&s;ion of the Per&s;on's na|tural &s;inful and mi&s;erable State, according to the Word. The Heart and Con&s;cience bearing Witne&s;s thereto.</Q> For the Confutation of this non&s;en&s;ical <HI>Moravian</HI> Notion, I would re|fer the Reader to my Sermons again&s;t the <HI>Mo|ravians pag.</HI> 3. 4. 5. and to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Dicken&s;on</HI>'s
<PB N="19" REF="005297_0019_1016F55EDE321270">
ingenious Dialogues, wherein this Point is more largely di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Our Oppo&s;ers, as I am credibly inform'd, have done much Injury to Religion by indi&s;tinct and un&s;ea|&s;onable Di&s;cour&s;es upon this Point, <HI>viz. That Per|&s;ons may have Grace and not know it.</HI> This was in&s;i&s;ted upon at a Time, when Multitudes were under Convictions, and the Con&s;equence was, that many relap&s;ed into their former Secu|rity.</P>
<P>They have likewi&s;e, as has been ob&s;erv'd, rais'd the Cry of Order, and &s;et it in &s;uch a Light, as has had a Tendency to blacken the Characters of &s;ome of God's poor Servants, in the Opinion of &s;ome, and its probable that this was their De|&s;ign; this has likewi&s;e been a plau&s;ible Mean of ob|&s;tructing God's Work in the Land.</P>
<P>And indeed this is the Artifice and Trick which the Oppo&s;ers of Religion have u&s;ed again&s;t God's faithful Servants of old. <HI>Elijah</HI> was charged by <HI>Ahab</HI> as a <HI>Troubler of I&s;rael, Paul</HI> repre&s;ented as a <HI>Mover of Sedition,</HI> and our LORD him&s;elf was faulted for not ob&s;erving the Tradition of the Fathers. And thus while our Oppo&s;ers contend for what is comparatively but the tything of <HI>Mint,</HI> and <HI>Annies,</HI> and <HI>Cummin,</HI> they neglect the weightier Matters of the Law.</P>
<P>But the 2d Particular, again&s;t which the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> Rea&s;onings (if they may be &s;o called) are prin|cipally directed, is re&s;pecting what I have &s;aid in the 18 and 19 <HI>pag.</HI> of the <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon in the&s;e Words, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>If the Mini&s;try of natural Men be, as it has been repre&s;ented, then it is both lawful and expedient, to go from them to hear Godly Per&s;ons; yea it is &s;o far from being &s;inful to do this, that one who lives under a pious Mini&s;ter of le&s;&s;er Gifts, after having ho|ne&s;tly endeavour'd to get Benefit by his Mini|&s;try, and gets little or none, but doth find real Benefit, and more Benefit el&s;ewhere, I &s;ay he
<PB N="20" REF="005297_0020_1016F562DCA920B0">
may lawfully go, and that frequently, where he gets mo&s;t Good to his precious Soul after regular Application to the Pa&s;tor where he lives for his Con&s;ent, and propo&s;ing the Rea|&s;ons thereof, when this is done in the Spirit of Love and Meekne&s;s without contempt of any, as al&s;o without ra&s;h Anger or vain Curio&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> do mo&s;t unju&s;tly repre&s;ent my Meaning, in the afore&s;aid Paragraph, as appears from the 95 <HI>pag</HI> of their Pamphlet, where they &s;ay, as to the fourth Inference, <Q>which &s;eems to have been the main &s;cope of the Performance, <HI>viz.</HI> To di&s;&s;olve all relative Bonds and Ties be|tween Pa&s;tor and People, at lea&s;t to proclaim them null and void, as to the People's Obligation therefrom to attend upon the Admini&s;trations of their own fixed Pa&s;tors &s;tatedly; &s;o that if we take Mr. <HI>T.</HI> up right, his declared Judgment here is, that People, after the Choice of a Mini&s;ter to be their &s;tated Pa&s;tor, are at their free Liberty to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from his Mini&s;try, as far and as often as they, or any of them plea&s;es, whether the Mini&s;ter be godly or gracele&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> What they have &s;aid is as contrary as any Thing can be, to my expre&s;s Declaration in the preceeding Paragraph: If I thought, as the <HI>Que|ri&s;ts</HI> &s;ugge&s;t, that People may ab&s;ent them&s;elves as far and as often as they plea&s;e, I would not have expre&s;sly guarded again&s;t it, by mentioning a pre|vious regular Application, and thus it is evident, that the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> do not argue again&s;t my Opini|on fairly &s;tated, but fir&s;t mi&s;repre&s;ent it, and then oppo&s;e with much earne&s;tne&s;s their own Figment, and therefore all their Rea&s;onings on that Head fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>Let my Opinion be fairly &s;tated as it is in the Sermon, and this Exception from that general Rule added, namely, that they &s;hould go where they get the mo&s;t Good &s;tatedly, after regular Ap|plication to the Mini&s;ter, or Church Se&s;&s;ion, whereto
<PB N="21" REF="005297_0021_1016F5646445E768">
they belong, unle&s;s their particular Good endan|gers or ob&s;tructs the general Good of the Society, whereto they have a Relation, in this we ought doubtle&s;s to prefer the general before our particu|lar Good, <HI>e. g.</HI> it may &s;o happen, that if a Per&s;on of great Importance and Influence in a little Soci|ety &s;hould go &s;tatedly el&s;ewhere, it would break the Society. This and &s;uch like Ca&s;es we mu&s;t deny our&s;elves.</P>
<P>As to going el&s;ewhere after Application,&mdash; I mean no more, and no le&s;s than this, that we &s;hould pay all that Deference to Church Judicato|ries, which is con&s;i&s;tent with the Right of private Judgment, in Matters of Con&s;cience. Any who carry the Matter farther, as it &s;eems the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> do, by what I have mentioned from them and others, pa&s;s under the &s;pecious Names of Order and Go|vernment, they erect a Tyranny upon the Ruins of every Thing that is valuable in human Nature. Now let my Opinion be &s;tated as afore&s;aid, and I may bid Defiance to the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> and all of their Stamp to overthrow it.</P>
<P>But to &s;et my Opinion in a more clear and di&s;|tinct Light, I &s;hall take leave to mention the fol|lowing Particulars, which are either expre&s;s'd in, or plainly deducible from, the 19 <HI>pag.</HI> of my <HI>Not|tingham</HI> Sermon, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Negatively, I do not a&s;&s;ert or maintain, that Per&s;ons may or &s;hould go from their own Church|es to others at all, much le&s;s frequently, meerly in order to tickle an exorbitant Fancy, or for the &s;ake of vain Curio&s;ity, No! No! Upon the contrary I believe, it is &s;inful to go from a more plain awak|ening Soul &s;earching and &s;avoury Mini&s;try, to a le&s;s plain, le&s;s awakening, le&s;s &s;avoury one, meerly to get carnal Ea&s;e to a labouring Mind, or Gratifi|cation to a Di&s;temper'd Palate, by affected Bom|ba&s;t or gingle of Language, Nor</P>

<P>Here it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that as Mini&s;ters are apt to be under the Influence of a Partial Bya&s;s, when their Honour or Intere&s;t is or &s;eems to be touched, having like Pa&s;&s;ions with other Men; &s;o the People are liable to the following Extreams, namely, either to make no Difference at all among Mini&s;ters, or to make too much: The former they are inclined to, while under the Power of a deep Security, and the latter they are in great Danger of, when they are awakened, and for &s;ome Time after their Conver&s;ion. Now both the&s;e Evils &s;hould be oppos'd and corrected, for indeed both are very hurtful. Duty lies here (as Philo&s;ophers &s;ay of Vertue in general) in a mediocrity or mid|dle between tho&s;e Extreams. Mini&s;ters &s;hould nei|ther be &s;lighted or idolized. But po&s;itively what I believe and profe&s;s in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e is,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is lawful for a Per&s;on, who lives un|der a Mini&s;ter of le&s;&s;er Gifts, (even tho' really religious) that after having, with Simplicity and Uprightne&s;s, us'd his utmo&s;t Endeavours, (&s;o far as a&s;&s;i&s;ted by God) to gain Benefit by his Mini|&s;try, and yet gets little or none, but doth el&s;e|where get Good, or more Good, (e&s;pecially by one of the &s;ame Per&s;ua&s;ion) after regular Application, to go where he gets mo&s;t Good to his Soul.

<P>Here let the Reader ob&s;erve, that the afore&s;aid more particular and di&s;tinct Account, which I have now given of my Opinion, re&s;pecting that Point which the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Examiner</HI> principally op|po&s;e, is but a Tran&s;cript of what I had written
<PB N="24" REF="005297_0024_1016F56A673B7500">
as my Sentiments upon this Subject many Years before the <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon was preach'd.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould take the &s;ame trifling &s;ophi&s;tical and voluminous Method's with the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> Performance, as they have done with my Sermon, the Book would &s;well to a Quarto, if not a Folio Volumn perhaps, and this would be much for Edification, woudn't it? It would be no hard Task to tell of 11 yea of 20 Maxims of &s;elfi&s;h Policy, and fal&s;e Doctrine, that &s;eem to be at the Bottom of their Arguings, but I have &s;omething of more Importance to manage. Why don't the&s;e wondrous wi&s;e and learned Men, the <HI>Queri&s;ts,</HI> and others of their Kid|ney, take famous Dr. <HI>Voetius,</HI> one of the mo&s;t emi|nent Lights of the Reformed Churches to task, and confute his accurate Di&s;&s;ertation upon this Subject, in his Book of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Policy, pag.</HI> 68. <HI>que&s;t.</HI> 17. and likewi&s;e in his Book of <HI>A&s;cetic Theology, chap.</HI> 10. <HI>pag.</HI> 222. 3. There they may find their petty So|phi&s;ms and unlearned Cavils fully baffled I would advi&s;e them to do it in <HI>Latin</HI> for the Benefit of all the Churches: Such great Men &s;houdn't lie conceal'd. If they take the &s;ame Method of quibbling and &s;aying a great deal be&s;ide the Point in Di&s;pute, as they have done with me, they'll be &s;ure of confuting him, in the Opinion of their gracele&s;s and Ignorant Admirers e&s;pecially. And after they have done this in order to compleat a large Volumn upon the Subject, they may likewi&s;e take to task, <HI>Hilder&s;ham,</HI> and <HI>Fener,</HI> two learned and pious Briti&s;h Divines, who are al&s;o of my Senti|ment. (&s;ee <HI>Hilder</HI> Lectures <HI>pag.</HI> 271. and <HI>pag.</HI> 253 4.) and confute them too; which if they pur&s;ue their u&s;ual Method, they may ea&s;ily effect as afore&s;aid; they are &s;uch Dab&s;ters at di&s;puting, or cavilling ra|ther, that I que&s;tion whether any Writing in the World can &s;tand them in their Way.</P>
<P>One In&s;tance of which under the pre&s;ent Head I am di&s;cour&s;ing upon, I &s;hall take leave to mention is, their making the Relation of a Mini&s;ter to his
<PB N="25" REF="005297_0025_1016F56C595F8F48">
People, the &s;ame with that of a Husband to his Wife, in re&s;pect of their Obligation to attend &s;tatedly upon his Mini&s;try; <HI>&s;ee pag.</HI> 133.</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> II. <Q>Tho' we allow Men &s;hould &s;eek the greater Good; yet we would ask, Whether this greater Good be mo&s;t likely to be obtain|ed in the Way of God's Appointment, and in the U&s;e of regular and not irregular Means? Or whether the Notion that &s;tolen Bread is &s;weet, be a true or a fal&s;e Notion? Or to u&s;e Mr. <HI>T.</HI>'s own Phra&s;e, <HI>Doth not he act like a Fool,</HI> who for&s;akes his own cha&s;te Wife, in Hopes of getting more Plea&s;ure in the Embraces of a Strum|pet?</Q></P>
<P>The Former agrees well with what they &s;ay, <HI>pag.</HI> 116. thus, <Q>Is it not &s;ome Affront to &s;ay, in the open Parlour, that <HI>Doll is as good as my Lady;</HI> but mu&s;t &s;he be better too?</Q></P>
<P>That there is an Obligation upon the People to attend upon their Pa&s;tors Mini&s;trations &s;tatedly, I do not deny but affirm; but in the mean Time, I abhor the Notion of the <HI>Queri&s;ts, viz. That, that Obligation is equal to the Marriage Contract:</HI> For if &s;o, it will nece&s;&s;arily follow, that every Time the Mini&s;ter preaches to any be&s;ides his own People, he commits Adultery, and every Time the People hear another, they likewi&s;e commit Adultery. At this Rate a Mini&s;ter would be no Mini&s;ter, but in his own Pari&s;h, and every Time he Steps over the Line, his Right to exerci&s;e his mini&s;terial Office evani&s;hes.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, according to this Plan, the Presbyterian Churches, by maintaining the Lawfulne&s;s of the tran&s;porting of Mini&s;ters from one Place to ano|ther, in order to exerci&s;e their Pa&s;toral Office there &s;tatedly, and that purely to promote the greater Good of the Church; and their acting ac|cordingly is a maintaining and practi&s;ing of Adul|tery; and do not the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> profe&s;s this very Doctrine, while they a&s;&s;ume the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> name,
<PB N="26" REF="005297_0026_1016F5734755F1E8">
and have they not acted according to it, in a pub|lick and &s;ocial Manner not long &s;ince? Well then don't they according to their own Plan of Rea&s;oning avow and practi&s;e Adultery? Be&s;ides it may be here ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> have &s;o far for&s;a|ken the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Plan of Government, that they have in this Point under debate, adobted the ri|diculous Notion of the rigid <HI>Independents</HI> and <HI>Browni&s;ts,</HI> what little Rea&s;on have the&s;e Men to glory in the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Name?</P>
<P>Seeing the Relation between Pa&s;tor and People is mutual, mu&s;t not what they Term a Breach of it be upon both Sides equally Criminal? If a Mini|&s;ter may go from the People to whom he is re|lated, and preach &s;tatedly to others, after a regular Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, in order to do more Good to the Souls, of Men, why then mayn't the People go &s;tatedly to get greater Good to their Souls, after the afore|&s;aid Application, &s;houdn't we be as careful to pro|mote our own as anothers Good? And pray why are not the <HI>Presbitery</HI> as capable to judge of Peoples getting Good, as of the probability of a Mini&s;ters doing Good?</P>
<P>I have not Lei&s;ure nor Inclination, to offer a|ny Remarks upon the Prophanity of the <HI>Queri&s;ts,</HI> their begging the Que&s;tion in debate, and many other Ab&s;urdities, which are contain'd in what I have but now cited from them. And therefore I &s;hall only take leave at pre&s;ent to add: That the&s;e Oppo&s;ers of God's Work, thro' their Selfi&s;hne&s;s, and the Heat of their Prejudice have endeavour'd to confute virtually and con&s;equentially their own profe&s;&s;ed Opinion and Practice, as well as the Senti|ments of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Churches univer&s;ally. What a Shame is it, that the&s;e Men &s;hould ca&s;t Scandalous Reflections upon the <HI>Body of the reformed Churches,</HI> and labour to prove them all to be guil|ty of Adultery as well as them&s;elves?</P>
<P>Pray hasn't every ordained Mini&s;ter, an habitual Relation to the whole vi&s;ible Church? And mu&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="005297_0027_1016F574CE0EE080">
not this be brought into Exerci&s;e as to particular Societies, in a regular Manner, as the greater Good of the whole requires, is it not contrary to common Sen&s;e, to immagine that &s;eeing every Mi|ni&s;ter, has an habitual Relation to, and is a Member of the whole vi&s;ible Church, and is by Con&s;cience and Office oblig'd to promote the greater Good thereof, that his actual Relation to any particular Branch of it, &s;hould continue any longer than is con&s;i&s;tent herewith? As the common Maxim is <HI>ex ungue Leonem, by the Claw the Lyon is known,</HI> So the Reader by this In&s;tance may gue&s;s at the Temper of the <HI>Queri&s;ts,</HI> and their manner of trifling in Di&s;|putation. But enough of this</P>
<P>I return to our <HI>Examiners</HI> Performance, and beg his Pardon that I have interupted by &s;o long a Digre&s;&s;ion, my remarks upon it; and doing it the Ju&s;tice it de&s;erves. But &s;eeing it was only to pay &s;ome Complements, to a Work of his dear Friends, which he has in &s;o high E&s;teem; I hope he will have me excus'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Examiner</HI> &s;ays, <HI>pag.</HI> 4 <Q>That Mr. <HI>T's</HI> zealous Advocates here, and el&s;ewhere, have by Way of Charity, di&s;pers'd about the Country, great Num|bers of the la&s;t Edition, (meaning of the <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon) tending to corrupt the Minds of People, from the Simplicity which is in CHRIST, and to promote that Confu&s;ion and &s;eperating Spirit, which he him&s;elf has been in&s;trumental in rai&s;ing in many Places.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> What this Author Means, by the Simplici|ty "which is in CHIST, I cannot tell, but &s;ure I am that in&s;tead of corrupting Mens Minds, &amp;c. it tends to prevent their being corrupted, to inform them of the Danger of an ungodly Mini&s;try; and to direct Men to the be&s;t Means, has a direct Tendency to bring them to CHRIST, and to the Simplicity that is in him. Both which Particulars are the Sub|&s;tance and Scope of that Sermon, (which this Au|thor oppo&s;es) and therefore it was an act of true Cha|rity
<PB N="28" REF="005297_0028_1016F578C76BD378">
in tho&s;e whom he calls my Advocates, to di&s;|per&s;e them. But on the Contrary to excite People to an Indifferency in their Choice of Mini&s;ters, or to encourage unconverted Men to come into the Mini&s;try, or to be offended at the odious Characters the Scriptures give them, or to befriend them in their &s;ordid Oppo&s;ition to Gods Work and Servants, is a &s;inful Simplicity, and horrid Cruelty! And that the Examiner is Guilty of all the&s;e Things, either expre&s;ly or virtually, will appear I tru&s;t thy the fol|lowing Pages.</P>
<P>The Sermon rightly under&s;tood, has no tendency to promote Confu&s;ion and a &s;eparating Spirit. If I had a&s;&s;erted, that a certain Knowledge of the States of others was attainable, or that unconverted Mini&s;ters were never us'd as Means of doing Good, or that it was a Sin to hear them, or that it was lawful to go &s;tatedly from the hearing of that Mini&s;ter whom we are under a Relation to, at our Plea&s;ure, there would be &s;ome Umbrage or Rea&s;on for the Charge; but &s;eeing I have &s;aid neither of the&s;e, but on the contrary a&s;|&s;erted the nece&s;&s;ity of previous Application, &amp;c. the Charge is without any real Foundation.</P>
<P>This Author farther adds, <Q>that I my &s;elf have been in&s;trumental, of rai&s;ing in many of their Places, Confu&s;ion and a &s;eparating Spirit.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It is a notorious Fal&s;hood, <HI>Thou&s;ands</HI> in <HI>N. En|gland</HI> can witne&s;s that I &s;pake &s;eldom of the Mini&s;try at all; not one Word came out of my Lips, in Favour of &s;eparating from them. But if this Author means by Confu&s;ion and a &s;eparating Spirit, a Scriptural and rational Di&s;tre&s;s of Soul for Sin, and a Sepa|ration from it in Affection and Practi&s;e, he in that Sen&s;e &s;peaks the Truth, the&s;e Things I confe&s;s I was (thro' Grace) in&s;trumental in rai&s;ing, in ma|ny of their Places.</P>
<P>But to confirm his awful Charge he adds this In|vincible Argument viz. <Q>For many are fully per|&s;waded, that Mr. <HI>T</HI>'s Sermon, and practice upon it, have &s;own the Seeds of all the Di&s;cord, In|tru&s;ion,

Confu&s;ion, Separaion, Hatred, Variance, Emulation Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Here&s;ys, &amp;c. that have been &s;pringing up, in &s;o many of the Towns and Churches thro' the Province for two Years pa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> A dreadful Inditement indeed if true, con|&s;i&s;ting of eleven Particulars, and yet behold and wonder there's &s;omething left behind unexpre&s;s'd, for there is an <HI>&amp; cetera</HI> at the Heels of it! But it is my Comfort that his Libel is fal&s;e and ridiculous. Methinks if the <HI>Examiner</HI> has any remains of Con|&s;cience left, it mu&s;t needs make him unea&s;y and a&s;hamed, that he has utter'd eleven Fal&s;hoods at a Breath; but pray Sir, why didn't you favour us with the whole Catalogue of Crimes, was you aware that you had already mentioned more than you could prove, if &s;o it was di&s;creet in you not to proceed farther, but to make an <HI>Et cetera</HI> &s;upply the Place of Particulars. Terrible, and have I &s;own the Seeds of Here&s;y and Trea&s;on too a|mong you. Alack and alas a-day? Why did n't you charge me with Murder and Bla&s;phemy al&s;o? For you had as much Rea&s;on for the&s;e as for the others, aye Trea&s;on! Is this your Charity? do you want the civil Sword to be drawn again&s;t me as a Rebel to the State for preaching Faith and Re|pentance &s;ucce&s;sfully? wou'd you embrue your Hands in my Blood, that travel'd thro' the Winter Cold to do your Country Good? But pray Sir, where are the Proofs of the afore&s;aid Charge? <HI>Why this,</HI> <Q>That many are fully per&s;waded, that my Ser|mon and Practice upon it, have &s;own the Seeds, &amp;c. as afore&s;aid.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> And what if they be? It's either thro' the Force of their Prejudice, or by fal&s;e Information. Many more in <HI>New-England,</HI> know the unrea&s;ona|blene&s;s and fal&s;hood of that Per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Charge of my practi&s;ing upon the Sermon, &s;uppo&s;es in my Apprehen&s;ion, that that Sermon was generally known by the People of <HI>New-England,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="005297_0030_1016F57E8BF89EF8">
either before or when I was among them, which is fal&s;e; unle&s;s our Author takes preaching <HI>Original Sin, Faith, Repentance, Ju&s;tification by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> CHRIST <HI>alone, the Conviction of Sin, the New Birth, and the nece&s;&s;ity of a holy Life,</HI> to be &s;owing the Seeds of Di&s;cord, I am not guilty. Multitudes know that the&s;e were the Doctrines which I principally preach'd upon in <HI>New-England.</HI> I may add likewi&s;e, that it is well known that there was no &s;uch Divi|&s;ions in <HI>N.

But &s;uppo&s;ing there had been, it would not have prov'd the Charge of Confu&s;ion, much le&s;s of Here&s;y, except I had &s;poken &s;omething that had a Tendency thereto. Would not it be unrea|&s;onable to charge the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> with all the Tu|mults which &s;ometimes attended his Preaching of which it was not the Cau&s;e, but innocent Occa&s;ion only. Would the <HI>Examiner</HI> Charge our Lord, with being the Author of Confu&s;ion, becau&s;e he tells us that he came not to <HI>&s;end Peace, but fire and Divi&s;ion?</HI></P>
<P>But our Author proceeds to repeat his Charge in the following invidious Terms, viz. <Q>Who hath been &s;o In&s;trumental to hatch the Cockatrice, as him&s;elf, tho' at the &s;ame Time he could grave|ly Advi&s;e others, to cru&s;h it in the Egg.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> This would be very incon&s;i&s;tent if true, but in as much as it is Fal&s;e, it mu&s;t be laid at his own Door. I be&s;eech the <HI>Examiner</HI> to con&s;ider &s;e|riou&s;ly the following Lines, in the 14. <HI>pag.</HI> of that Sermon he &s;o much Di&s;likes. <Q><HI>Mat.</HI> 23.13. <HI>Wo unto you, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, Hypocrites, for ye &s;hut up the Kingdom of Heaven again&s;t Men, for ye neither go in your &s;elves, nor &s;uffer tho&s;e that are entering to go in Phari&s;ee</HI> Teachers will with the utmo&s;t Hate, op|po&s;e the very Work of Gods Spirit upon the Souls of Men, and Labour by all Means to blacken it as well as the In&s;truments, which the Almighty improves to promote the &s;ame, if it come near their Borders, and Interferes with their Credit or Inte|re&s;t; thus did the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> with our Saviour.</Q>&mdash;

May Almighty God incline our Author, to exa|mine impartially, if this be not his Ca&s;e and Prac|tice?</P>
<P>But the Examiner proceeds to &s;ay, <Q>Whoever will take Pains to con&s;ider the main Scope of Mr. <HI>T</HI>'s Sermon at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> will find the Principles of it, &s;ubver&s;ive of Go&s;pel Order, the publick Mini&s;try, and publick Means of E|ducation; and what have we more? What could touch the Apple of our Eye, like this fatal Blow? It is a Blow at the Root!</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> If the Charge was true, that Sermon wou'd de&s;erve the mo&s;t &s;peedy Condemnation. But where is the Proof? Why the <HI>Examiners</HI> A&s;&s;ertion, or <HI>ip&s;e dixit:</HI> But will this &s;uffice the Impartial, no &s;urely! What can't the Danger of an unconverted Mini&s;try be repre&s;ented, and private Seminaries of Learning be erected, e&s;pecially where there are no publick ones, without endangering the publick Mini&s;try, and publick Means of Education? Strange! What Notion then mu&s;t this Gentleman have of the Mini&s;try? Does he think they are all unconverted? If &s;o, he is very uncharitable indeed! I'm &s;orry, it &s;hould touch him &s;o near as the Apple of his Eye, to have the Danger of an unconverted Mini&s;try &s;et forth as in my <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon; if he were not too nearly related to them, methinks it wouldn't touch him in &s;o tender a Part, but on the contrary it would make him glad, to &s;ee their Picture &s;o ju&s;tly drawn, that &s;o they might &s;ee their Faces in that Gla&s;s, and be convinc'd and a&s;hamed. If the Sermon be a Blow at the Root, as our Author ob&s;erves, it is at the Root, of an ungodly Mini|&s;try, and is our Author &s;orry, that that Root of Bitterne&s;s &s;hould be &s;truck at? When I compos'd it, I expected it would be judged by that Tribe it detected, as guilty of <HI>Scandalum Magnatum, as wor|thy of Bonds and of Death.</HI> I &s;uppos'd, it would be like rou&s;ing a Wa&s;ps Ne&s;t, and I have found it according to my Expectation.

God's Work, have dip't their Tongues and Pens in Gall, and by their Malignant Invectives, have endeavour'd to bury its Author in Ruins; but peradventure it may have a Re&s;urrection to their Terror and Shame. What's the matter that the&s;e Men, can find nothing agreeable in that Sermon, that &s;o exactly de&s;cribes <HI>the naked Truth,</HI> the very Character Ca&s;e and Pranks of the ungodly Clergy? Suppo&s;ing &s;ome Things in it were worded in too &s;trong Terms, what then, &s;hou'd they condemn all for this, and want to commit it to the Flames? Indeed I think this Method of Proceeding, looks very &s;u&s;picious and Points out who they are?</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> proceeds to produce the Sen|timents of a Schi&s;matical Party whom he calls the Synod, wherein they condemn my Sermon preach|ed at <HI>Notingham,</HI> as a notable In&s;tance of our &s;owing Seeds of Divi&s;ion, <Q>And we charge him <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> with perverting Scripture, uncharitable ra&s;h judging the Body of the Clergy of this Ge|neration, in the Lump, and encouraging Factions and Di&s;orders therein!</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Perhaps this Gentleman thinks to grace and &s;trengthen his &s;ide of the Que&s;tion, by the Name of <HI>Synod.</HI> But I would have him to con&s;ider, that <HI>adhuc &s;ub judice lis e&s;t.</HI> The Point is in di&s;pute, whe|ther the Party he &s;peaks of, be the Synod of <HI>Phi|delphia</HI> or not, I humbly conceive they will not be found &s;o in the I&s;&s;ue, being but a minor Party to tho&s;e whom they condemn.</P>
<P>As to the Charge of Perverting Scripture in that Sermon, I deny it, I have better Interpreters, than them on my Side, that ju&s;tify the Sen&s;e I have given of the Scriptures in that Sermon. The Scrip|tures produced an&s;wer the De&s;ign I bro't them for. Namely, to &s;hew the Danger of an unconvert|ed Mini&s;try. And that the Almighty does not approve of natural Mens taking upon them the Mini&s;try in the ordinary Time of the Go&s;pel. It is they that have perverted my Meaning, and &s;o in con|&s;equence
<PB N="33" REF="005297_0033_1016F585CE4EC7E0">
thereof, would Charge upon me a pervert|ing of the Scripture.</P>
<P>As to what they call, uncharitable judging of the Body of the Clergy of this Generation, I would ask them, what they think them&s;elves? Do they Im|magine, that the greater Part of the Mini&s;ters of this Generation, are pious? Let them &s;peak out up|on this Head. Are not the greate&s;t part of the Clergy of this Generation Papi&s;ts, and is it unchari|table to &s;ay that &s;uch are unconverted? And are not many of the Prote&s;tant Clergy very un&s;ound in Principle, and unholy in Life? And is there not a great Number of others, who have a Form but hate the Power of Godline&s;s? Have not many tho&s;e Marks of Impiety that are mention'd in that Ser|mon which they oppo&s;e?</P>
<P>Truly I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the more I have had to do with them, and perceiv'd the Malignant Op|po&s;ition of &s;ome of them, again&s;t God's Work and Servants, the more my Opinion has been &s;trength|ened re&s;pecting the greatne&s;s of the Number of gracele&s;s Mini&s;ters. As to their Charge of &s;owing Seeds of Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>I would an&s;wer them in the&s;e Words of the <HI>Not|ingham</HI> Sermon <HI>pag.</HI> 25 <Q>the proper Cau&s;e of &s;in|ful Divi&s;ions, is that Enmity again&s;t God and Holine&s;s, which is in the Hearts of natu|ral Men of every order, being &s;tirr'd up by the Devil and their own proud and &s;elfi&s;h Lu&s;ts; and very often natural Men, who are the proper Cau&s;es of the Divi&s;ions afore&s;aid, are wont to deal with God's Servants, as <HI>Potiphars</HI> Wife did by <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> they lay all the Blame of their own Wickedne&s;s at their Doors, and make a loud Cry. <HI>This is truly the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is a Fruit of our Authors &s;trong Prejudice, to repre&s;ent me as holding in my <HI>Notingham</HI> &amp; <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermons, two Principles as oppo&s;ite as the Heathen Principles, of a good and evil God, as will ap|pear I tru&s;t by the Sequel.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="005297_0034_1016F589B5295C18">But to proceed, our Charitable <HI>Examiner,</HI> is of|fended at the Rev. Mini&s;ters of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> for &s;peaking honourably of my Per&s;on, and late Performance, re&s;pecting the <HI>Moravians,</HI> it &s;eems, as if he grudg|ed that any &s;hou'd think or &s;peak well of me, where now is our Authors Charity, which he &s;aid he put on in his fir&s;t <HI>pag.</HI> dosn't it &s;eem as if he had drop't the Cloak quite?</P>
<P>What if the&s;e Rev. Gentlemen, had &s;een the <HI>Not|ingham</HI> Sermon, as he &s;ugge&s;ts; its like they woudn't have &s;o dreadful an Idea of it, as our Author (what their Opinion of the Sermon is I know not.) But on the Suppo&s;ition, that one or more of them were of Opinion, that there were &s;ome unguarded or exceptionable Expre&s;&s;ions in it, yet might they not con&s;i&s;tent with the Simplicity that is in CHRIST, forbear expre&s;&s;ing this, when they were not call'd to it. They were not prefacing the <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon, but others, which this Author him&s;elf does not object again&s;t; had they expre&s;s'd a Commendation of the&s;e, together with a Cen&s;ure becau&s;e of &s;uppos'd Exceptions in a|nother, wou'd it not have tended to mar the U&s;e|fulne&s;s of what they recommended, &s;hou'd not what a Per&s;on does well, be commended, notwith|&s;tanding of his &s;uppos'd or real Defects?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t appear evident to every impartial Mind, that the Rev. Mini&s;ters of Bo&s;ton, have acted ac|cording to the Simplicity that is in CHRIST, by recommending a Performance which was &s;ea&s;on|able, and had &s;ome Tendency to prevent, the Spread of <HI>Moraviani&s;m</HI> in this Land; and by giving the Author of it that Honour, which they thought was ju&s;t, in order to make the Performnace of more Service.</P>
<P>But how to reconcile our Authors Conduct, in this Affair with the Simplicity that is in CHRIST, I profe&s;s I am at a Lo&s;s? If he has any Love to the Truths of God, which are now &s;o much at|tack'd in this Land, why does he come out with &s;uch Virulence again&s;t me when I am appearing
<PB N="35" REF="005297_0035_1016F58C6C964A98">
for them, and endeavouring as well as I can to de|fend them. Why is he utterly &s;ilent, about what I have &s;aid in Defence of the main Truths of the Go&s;pel? Doesn't it &s;eem as if &s;ome <HI>Moracian</HI> or <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> had hir'd his Pen, to attempt by Hook and Crook to render me Ridiculous, that thus the In|fluence of my late Performance again&s;t them might be fru&s;trate?</P>
<P>This Author farther betrays the badne&s;s of his Cau&s;e, and Spirit, by deriding tho&s;e Rev. Gen|tlemen, who are above his Contempt, by in&s;inu|ating that they believ'd, &s;ome Per&s;on to be infallible in the&s;e Words.</P>
<P><Q>If they think as Prote&s;tants generally do, that Infalibility may be mi&s;taken.</Q>&mdash;But afterwards, in the &s;ame <HI>Page,</HI> he grows more warm and con|fident, and &s;ays, <Q>it &s;eems that &s;uch a Prime In|&s;trument of the Work, that has been going on in the American Provinces, for the two la&s;t Years mu&s;t be judged infallible, and &s;upported with the highe&s;t Encomiums of &s;ix mo&s;t Rev. Mini&s;ters.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Why has this Author charg'd &s;uch a noto|rious Fal&s;hood, upon the&s;e worthy Gentlemen, namely, that they have judged me infallible, for the which he has not the lea&s;t Foundation; can they not commend what they judge to be Prai&s;e Worthy in any, without &s;uppo&s;ing him to be In|fallible? To what Lengths will Men's Rage and Prejudice carry them?</P>
<P>And How fal&s;e and ungenerous is it in our Au|thor, to charge tho&s;e Gentlemen in the &s;ame <HI>pag.</HI> with having Men's Per&s;ons in Admiration, becau&s;e of Advantage. With a Relation to me; his Words are the&s;e,</P>
<P><Q>But it &s;eems no Man dar'd, or car'd to &s;ay un|to him, why do&s;t thou &s;uch Things, &s;uch is the Danger of having Mens Per&s;ons in Admiration becau&s;e of Advantage.</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, What Advantage could the&s;e Gentle|men propo&s;e by a poor Stranger, who was to be

among them but a few Weeks, and probably ne|ver like to &s;ee their Faces any more in this World? And who as our Author tells the Story, <HI>pag.</HI> 8. <Q>Came with a great Troop of 20 or 30 Hor&s;e, entring into other Men's Labours, and devour|ing their Livings.</Q>&mdash; <HI>An&s;.</HI> No, It was Love to Gods Work which this Man de&s;pi&s;es, that excited their E&s;teem of an In&s;trument, whom it plea&s;ed the Sovereign God to improve, in promoting of it! But if no Mans daring or caring to &s;ay to me, <HI>why do&s;t thou &s;uch Things?</HI> would prove the Charge of having Men in Admiration, becau&s;e of Advantage; as our Author in&s;inuates, then the pre&s;ent Oppo&s;ers of Gods Work in <HI>N. England,</HI> wou'd be as guilty of it, as tho&s;e whom they now unju&s;tly de&s;pi&s;e: For where is there one of them, that &s;ugge&s;ted to me the lea&s;t doubt of the Reality of it then? neither did I meet with the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition again&s;t the Doctrines of Grace, which I preach'd, except in one or two &s;mall Towns. The Truth is, the Convic|tion and Conver&s;ion of Sinners, was attended with &s;uch Maje&s;ty and Power, as a&s;toni&s;hed and terrified tho&s;e ungodly Creatures, which were not convert|ed: So that for a Time hardly any of them dur&s;t move his Tongue, much le&s;s his Pen again&s;t it; but after a While the Influences of the Divine Spirit be|ing withdrawn, and &s;ome Stumbling Blocks falling in the Way, ob&s;tinate Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors grow profane|ly bold in oppo&s;ing God's Work, and in traducing and contemning his Servants.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve Reader, how this Author di&s;covers his Antipathy again&s;t the Work of God, in the follow|ing Lines. <Q>I heartily wi&s;h (&s;ays he) he was more worthy, for whom they have done this, and that they them&s;elves had not in this Labour of Love, to their dear and honoured Brother, betray'd too great a Liking, of what is commonly call'd this Work.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I joyn with this Author in the fir&s;t part of his Petition, but have Rea&s;on to doubt from his pre|&s;ent
<PB N="37" REF="005297_0037_1016F5920E9CC0D0">
Performance, that if it was an&s;wered, he wou'd like me le&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible than he does! but as to the latter part of it, I mu&s;t declare my di&s;&s;ent, altho' I que&s;tion not his Sincerity therein. But on the contrary, I ble&s;s God who has excited tho&s;e worthy &amp; famous Mini&s;ters, to appear as Witne&s;&s;es to his Truths and Work, in a day of Degeneracy, Bla&s;|phemy and Rebuke; this is their Honour, and will be their un&s;peakable Advantage in a future World; whatever the Ignorant or Prejudiced may &s;ay to the contrary. The World may &s;ee by this, what &s;ort of a Per&s;on this <HI>Examiner</HI> is, who attempts to wound my Character and U&s;efullne&s;s, namely, that he is one, who di&s;likes the late Revival of Re|ligion in this Land.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> proceeds to ob&s;erve, upon the PREFACE thus. <Q>The&s;e Rev. Gentlemen &s;ay, This our dear Brother vi&s;ited us at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> two Years ago; and in the Spirit of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> entred into his Labours.</Q> Upon which he &s;ays, <Q>It's true Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> vi&s;ited the&s;e Parts about that Time, and the Vi&s;it was full of Extra|ordinaries, his progre&s;s thro' the Province, &s;a|vour'd more of worldly Pomp and Grandeur, than the Humility of the meek and lowly JESUS, he came eating and dringink, gallopping over the Country with his <HI>Congregatio de propoganda &amp;c. mag|na comitante caterva,</HI> with a Troop of twenty or thirty Hor&s;e, entring into other Men's Labours and devouring their Livings, having all Things in common.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> What Envy appears in this Repre&s;entation? It's true &s;ome Per&s;ons did of their own meer Motion, without any Invitation of mine, accompany me in my Travels, &s;ometimes more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s in Number; and for what I could learn, with a De&s;ire to receive Benefit to their Souls by my Preach|ing; and what wou'd our Author have me to do in &s;uch a Ca&s;e? Would he have me to drive them
<PB N="38" REF="005297_0038_1016F594C81D9F18">
away? Why does he &s;ay that this &s;avour'd more of worldly Pomp, than of the Humility of the meek and lowly JESUS? Didn't Multitudes follow Chri&s;t, to attend his itinerary Labours? And didn't he come eating and drinking? Wou'd our Author have me live without Victuals and Drink? Or wou'd he have me &s;tarv'd to Death? But perhaps the Empha&s;is of the Charge, con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>gallopping</HI> over the Country. Really the Snow was &s;o deep during a good Part of my Travels, that it was no proper Sea&s;on for gallopping. I don't remember for my Part, that I gallop't any, but if I had, I don't &s;ee the Harm of it. Methinks our Author's trifling in his Charges again&s;t me for the Want of proper Materials, turns to my Commen|dation, and therefore his futile Reflections, contra|ry to his De&s;ign, are proper Panegyrick upon me, and a Satyre upon him&s;elf. O! but he &s;ays that I enter'd into other Men's Labours.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Its true I preach'd in other Mini&s;ters Pul|pits, but not without their Con&s;ent, and where was the Harm of this? But he adds devouring their Livings.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It's true, when I was invited by Mini&s;ters or others, to &s;tay in their Hou&s;es for a Night or &s;o in my Pa&s;s, I generally comply'd, and partook of what they &s;et before me, and &s;o did any that were plea&s;ed to travel with me. I defy this <HI>Ex|aminer</HI> to prove that I did either without Invita|tion; and where was the Harm of complying as before? dosn't the <HI>Examiner</HI> remember the old Pro|verb, <HI>volenti nulla fit injuria, to a willing Per&s;on no Inju|ry is done.</HI> What does he mean by <HI>devouring</HI> then? Does he intend that I, or any of my Companions in Travel, eat or drank to exce&s;s? If he does let him prove it if he can? But here I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, with all due gratitude that much Kindne&s;s and Re&s;pect, was &s;hewn me by many in <HI>N. En|gland,</HI> in ho&s;pitable generous Entertainments; and does our Author grudge &amp; grumble at this? If it were
<PB N="39" REF="005297_0039_1016F59778654950">
not too rude and uncivil, I would remember him of a coveteous Per&s;on, that long &s;ince begrudged expen&s;ive Re&s;pect &s;hewn to our LORD. But it was not to his Honour.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> adds another Article of Charge, in this Paragraph, namely, having all Things in common.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> As before he had re&s;embled me to the Papi&s;ts in the&s;e Words, with his <HI>Congregatio de propaganda &amp;c.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e the word left out is <HI>Faith;</HI> &s;o that his Meaning is, that I went gallopping about with my Companions, to propagate <HI>the Faith.</HI> What Faith? Does he in&s;inuate the Roman Catholick, as his Form of Expe&s;&s;ion &s;eems to point to? This is exceeding invidious, doesn't this Author know in his Con&s;ci|ence that the Doctrines of Faith which I preach'd in <HI>New England,</HI> were no other than what is con|tain'd in the We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and the Doctrinal Articles of the Church of England? I &s;ay as before he re&s;embled me to the Papi&s;ts, &s;o here in the la&s;t Words of the Paragraph, to the Le|vellers, by &s;aying we had all Things in common. I will &s;ay no more to this than that it is another no|torious Fal&s;hood, either of this <HI>Examiners</HI> Invention or Publication.</P>
<P>The <HI>Examiner</HI> farther ob&s;erves, in the next Pa|ragraph, p. 8. <Q>He came in the Spirit of Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> indeed, when Procalmation was made before him as Vi&s;itor or Vicar-General, The Rev. Mr. <HI>T.</HI> de&s;igns to preach in &s;uch a City or Church to-day, and to-morrow in another, and continue in a Third <HI>and get Gain,</HI> without the lea&s;t Regard to the &s;tated Pa&s;tors of the Churches, <HI>volens, no|lens;</HI> pleading Extraordinaries for &s;u&s;pending Scripture Rules.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This is an unfair Repre&s;entation of the Ca&s;e, I &s;ent no &s;uch Word to any one Place in <HI>N. En|gland,</HI> that I would preach in their Churches or Towns, whether the Pa&s;tors would or not. When I came to any Place, where there was a &s;etled Mini|&s;ter,
<PB N="40" REF="005297_0040_1016F59938B04888">
I never preach'd without fir&s;t apprizing him of my Inclination, and if I was not prevented by his Invitation, asking his Leave, and this I every where obtain'd, before I preach'd in any Place, excepting one, where I came in the Evening, the Mini&s;ter declined letting me preach in the Meeting Hou&s;e that night, for Rea&s;ons which I thought were not relevant, and being invited by &s;ome to preach that Night, in a private Hou&s;e, I comply'd, at which the Mini&s;ter of the Place was pre&s;ent, di|ver&s;e People as I was inform'd, had come to the Meeting Hou&s;e, expecting Sermon, and I thought it was a pitty they &s;hould be di&s;appointed, without &s;ufficient Cau&s;e, and here it &s;hould be likewi&s;e ob|&s;erv'd, that the Mini&s;ter did not forbid my preach|ing in a private Hou&s;e, but on the contrary &s;ig|nified before &s;everal Per&s;ons, that if I came on a Lecture Day, he would invite me to preach pub|lickly; but thought that ringing the Bell in the Night, might &s;urprize the People, with an Alarm of Fire, and that the People not having &s;uffici|ent Warning there wou'dn't be a valuable Con|vention. But the &s;ame Gentleman invited me to preach in his Pulpit the next Day, and treat|ed me with much Kindne&s;s and Courte&s;ie.</P>
<P>As to what the <HI>Examiner</HI> &s;ays about <HI>getting Gain.</HI> It is exceeding invidious, I neither needed, nor ex|pected, nor de&s;ir'd any Thing for my Labours in <HI>N. England,</HI> if our Author can prove any of the&s;e, let him do it as &s;oon as he plea&s;es, was there any Collection made for me, in any one Place in <HI>N. En|gland,</HI> for near &s;ix Months that I travell'd in it, and preach'd daily? Nor was there any Thing given me, excepting in &s;even or eight Places in all <HI>N. En|gland,</HI> and that by &s;ome Gentlemen of their own ac|cord, and was it a Fault in me to accept of their Ge|nero&s;ity? What I have now &s;aid is with no De&s;ign of reflecting upon the Gentlmen of <HI>N. England,</HI> No, far be it from me, I hope ever to retain a grateful Sen&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="005297_0041_1016F59D80635998">
of their Kindne&s;s, but only to confute this ungene|rous Cavil.</P>
<P>The next Article of Charge is, that I plead <HI>Extra|ordinaries for &s;u&s;pending Scripture Rules.</HI> This Phra&s;e the <HI>Examiner</HI> &s;eems to have borrow'd from his dear Bre|thren by the Way, to which I an&s;wer, that it is alto|gether fal&s;e! I had no need of u&s;ing any &s;uch Plea, for I don't know that any Scripture Rule was &s;u&s;|pended by my preaching in <HI>New England,</HI> however I mu&s;t &s;till a&s;&s;ert that the Plea is in &s;ome Ca&s;es law|ful, whatever Contempt may be ca&s;t upon it by &s;ome. To &s;ay that <HI>ordinary Rules, or Rules for ordinary Ca&s;es</HI> &s;hould not be &s;u&s;pended in <HI>extraordinary</HI> Ca&s;es, is a bare fac'd contradicting of an antient Maxim con&s;ented to by the common Sen&s;e of Mankind, viz. <HI>That every general Rule admits of Exceptions,</HI> unle&s;s it can be pro|ved that <HI>ordinary</HI> and <HI>extraordinary</HI> Ca&s;es are the &s;ame; which from the nature of Things is impo&s;&s;ible, the Mea&s;ures in every thing cannot be proper in both, and to &s;ay the contrary is in other Words to de|ny the lawfullne&s;s of the Reformation from Pope|ry, in the Time of <HI>Swinglius, Luther,</HI> and <HI>Calvin;</HI> and if we mayn't judge for our &s;elves when the&s;e <HI>ex|traordinary</HI> Ca&s;es happen, we are Slaves indeed of the mo&s;t &s;ordid kind, and rob'd of every Thing that's worth keeping of a Religious Nature. Hereby a Church Tyrany is erected, and the hateful Romi&s;h Doctrines of implicite Faith and blind Obedince, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. God forbid that we &s;hould ca&s;t away the Liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free, and &s;uffer Men to lord it over our Con&s;ciences, and en|&s;lave us with their plau&s;ible Pretext of <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Order! Order, Order</HI> was the Cry of the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> in the Beginning of the Reformation from Popery, with a View to &s;top its Progre&s;s. The Text they trump'd up upon every Occa&s;ion, as Doctor <HI>Voetius</HI> ob&s;erves was <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.3. <HI>All therefore what&s;oever they bid you ob&s;erve, that ob&s;erve and do, omnia, omnia, all, all,</HI> they mu&s;t ob&s;erve, all the holy Traditions of the Roman Catholick Church, all the holy Cannons
<PB N="42" REF="005297_0042_1016F5A06D8C1090">
and Orders, or be curs'd with Bell, Book and Candle Light as di&s;orderly and contemptuous Per&s;ons, Schi&s;maticks, Hereticks, and what not? But the ble&s;&s;ed Reformers better under&s;tood the Scriptures and their Duty from them, than to mind their &s;elfi&s;h impertinet Cant, or to be &s;car'd from it by their invidious and groundle&s;s Anathemas. And has not the Epi&s;copal Church excommunicated all that di&s;&s;ent from her, by her Cannons. Now all that make them, (I mean the Cannons) will &s;ay that they are agreeable to the Scriptures. And &s;o Scrip|ture <HI>Rules.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that we &s;hould with equal Care avoid both Extreams, viz. TYRANNY upon the one hand, and the abu&s;e of CHRISTIAN LIBERTY upon the other, TRUTH and DUTY lye between both, as we &s;hould abhor with a perfect Hatred the en&s;laving Schemes of <HI>High Church Bigots,</HI> &s;o on the contrary, we &s;hould equally abhor and avoid, the <HI>Plea of Ex|traordinaries,</HI> except the Ca&s;e be evidently &s;o.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> proceeds to &s;ay in the next Paragraph, <HI>pag.</HI> 8 <Q>He came in the Spirit of Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> when he treated the Body of the Mini&s;try in this Province, with &s;o much Neglect and contempt as he did, not only in not &s;uffer|ing him&s;elf to hear any of them, no not in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> it&s;elf, except once or twice.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This Charge is likewi&s;e a notorious Fal&s;hood! I never treated the Body of the Clergy in any Pro|vince of <HI>New England,</HI> with Neglect and Contempt. I have a Witne&s;s in Heaven and in my own Bo|&s;om that my not hearing mnay of the Mini&s;ters of <HI>New England,</HI> did not proceed from any Contempt of them. The Ca&s;e was plainly this, I was &s;tirr'd up at that Time by the Almighty to uncommon Zeal and Love for the Salvation of Mankind, &s;o that unu&s;ual Labours became natural to me, daily preaching was plea&s;ant and de&s;irable like the re|turns of my &s;tated Meals. I was therefore loath to ne|glect
<PB N="43" REF="005297_0043_1016F5A375ABA790">
Opportunities of preaching, e&s;pecially con|&s;idering my full Per&s;wa&s;ion, that God was remark|ably with me, and &s;ealed my Labours. The worthy and Rev. Mini&s;ters of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> perceiving that a di|vine Ble&s;&s;ing attended my Mini&s;trations, did hum|bly and lovingly invite me to preach frequently in that Metropolis, being willing and glad that Gods Work &s;hou'd be carry'd on, by any one the Lord wou'd plea&s;e to &s;end by; their conde&s;cending In|vitations I accepted with an affecting Sen&s;e of my own Unfitne&s;s and Unworthine&s;s, as the Searcher of all Hearts knows, as well as Admiration at the Humility, the Candor and Coure&s;ie of the&s;e Rev. Gentlemen, which I hope I &s;hall ever bear thankful Remembrance of.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> proceeds to &s;ay, <Q>but al&s;o in cru|elly cen&s;uring them (meaning the Mini&s;ters of the Province) in general, and rai&s;ing Jealou|&s;ies in the Minds of People of their faithful Mini|&s;ters, even to that Degree as hath ended in a Spirit of dreadful Separation in many Places.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This is likewi&s;e a notorious Fal&s;hood.

And fir&s;t he gravely, but impertinently, asks the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Bo&s;ton, whether they are of the &s;ame Mind, Spirit and Judgment with Mr.</HI> Whitefield? How childi&s;h is this, the&s;e Rev.

And this I believe was their Meaning, in the&s;e Words of their Preface which our <HI>Examiner</HI> critici&s;es &s;o much upon.

Mini&s;ters, whom our ill natur'd Author fleers at, were in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> at that Time he refers to. This was the Place of their fix'd Re&s;idence. See the Force of Prejudice, it will &s;ometimes drive Men of Wit and Addre&s;s, into Impertinence and Non&s;en&s;e, as well as Fal&s;hood; in order to gratify its Rancour. 'Tis like our Author is a Man of Sen&s;e, <HI>Sed aliquando bonus dormitat</HI> Homerus, <HI>Sometimes</HI> Homer <HI>&s;leeps.</HI> His unhappy Prejudice is &s;o &s;trong, that it &s;eems &s;ome|times to di&s;turb his Judgment, &s;o that he talks od|ly like a Man ju&s;t wak'd out of Sleep, who had been dreaming of &s;ome dreadful Events: Witne&s;s the frightful Catalogue of Crimes, which he put in his Indictment again&s;t me, before mentioned, namely, <HI>Di&s;cord, Intru&s;ion, Confu&s;ion, Separation, Ha|tred, Variance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Here|&s;ies,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ee pag 5.

in abruptly, a Pa&s;&s;age of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s <HI>Journal,</HI> about <HI>bodily Convul&s;ions,</HI> which was not &s;uffi|ciently guarded, that he might offer &s;ome matter of Reflection and Triumph. However if the Affair be examined, there will be found little Rea&s;on for either. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has not &s;aid that he believes, <HI>that all the&s;e bodily Convul&s;ions came from the Devil,</HI> and if he had, neither the Rev. Mini&s;ters of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> (&s;o far as I know) or my &s;elf, have ever been of that Opinion The&s;e Things may be other ways accounted for, con&s;i&s;tent with the animal Oeco|nomy. What if that dear Servant of God, Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had been mi&s;taken in a circum&s;tantial Point? Shall his Spirit, his State and Temper of Mind, be condemned for this? Or the State and Temper of others, becau&s;e they agree not with him herein? Is this our Author's Charity, which he talks &s;o much of?</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> proceeds to &s;ay, <Q>And &s;eeing nothing is more evident, than that Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> is the grand In&s;trument of promoting tho&s;e ani|mal Convul&s;ions, into which many of our new Converts have fallen, and upon which &s;o great a Stre&s;s is laid, by many in the Work of Con|ver&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Nothing is more evident, than that this is a notorious Fal&s;hood, <HI>viz. That I am the grand In&s;tru|ment of promoting tho&s;e animal Convul&s;ions.</HI> This Ca|lumny is invented by the Father of Lies, <HI>the Accu|&s;er of the Brethren,</HI> in order to ca&s;t odious Colours, upon the Work of God, and me his Servant. All my Congregation, and Multitudes more, can wit|ne&s;s, that I never encouraged tho&s;e Things, but on the contrary, that I have from the fir&s;t Begin|nings of &s;uch Appearances, in this Part of the Coun|try (which was long &s;ince) endeavour'd in the opene&s;t Manner to di&s;courage and check them, yea &s;ometimes to &s;uch Degree, as has griev'd &s;everal religious People. I have repeatedly done this before many thou&s;ands of Hearers.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="005297_0047_1016F5AD96FC1FF0">But our Author farther adds, <Q>That great Stre&s;s is laid upon <HI>the&s;e animal Convul&s;ions,</HI> by ma|ny in the Work of Conver&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> What does the <HI>Examiner</HI> mean by that Phra&s;e <HI>in the Work of Conver&s;ion?</HI> Does he think that Con|viction &s;trictly con&s;idered is gradual, then he is an <HI>Arminian;</HI> and its no wonder he di&s;likes my Di&s;cour&s;es again&s;t the <HI>Moravians,</HI> and indeed this is the mo&s;t natural and ea&s;ie Sen&s;e of his Words. Or does he &s;peak of Conver&s;ion in a larger Sen&s;e as including the preparative of Order <HI>viz.</HI> Con|viction, as well as the Fruits thereof, and mean thus, that &s;ome depend upon tho&s;e <HI>bodily Convul&s;ions</HI> as a Sign of Conver&s;ion. In the fir&s;t Sen&s;e his Charge cannot be true, becau&s;e Conver&s;ion in that re&s;pect is in&s;tantaneous; and tho' the latter may be true, yet I have great Rea&s;on to believe it to be fal&s;e: The Notion is ab&s;urd and ridiculous, contrary to common Sen&s;e, and therefore improbable to be true. Be&s;ides I never met with one Man in any Part of America, that was of that Opinion; or that ac|quainted me that he or they knew any one to hold it. But if our Author only means by the afore&s;aid Phra&s;e, that many imagin'd tho&s;e outward <HI>Con|vul&s;ions,</HI> or the exce&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion that occa&s;ion'd them, were in any re&s;pect Helps to Conver&s;ion, I will not undertake to be the Patron of &s;uch: For I think it is an unrea&s;onable and ridiculous Noti|on. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome few ignorant Per&s;ons, have been of this Opinion, but if &s;o what then? Shall their Folly be imputed to the whole Body? Or is it rea&s;onable to reflect upon the whole Work, becau&s;e of the Weakne&s;s of &s;ome of the Subjects of it? Some of the Oppo&s;ers in diver&s;e Parts of the World, have of late in&s;i&s;ted much upon this Topick, the&s;e <HI>bodily Convul&s;ions</HI> being &s;omewhat uncommon, and &s;urpri&s;ing, they have harp'd much upon this plau|&s;ible String; in order (as it &s;eems) to amu&s;e and prejudice the People again&s;t the Work of God!</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="005297_0048_1016F5B053F6B7C0">While the Woman the Church has been in Travail among us, the Dragon has &s;peu'd out Floods, Multitudes of Slanders and Calumnies, in order to de&s;troy the Woman and her Child. This is truly the Ca&s;e, notwith&s;tanding of all the artful Colour|ings, and deceitful Blinds that are put upon it by crafty Men.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> proceeds to &s;ay, <Q>Do they not take the Devils Part, who u&s;e Methods to farther &s;uch &s;ad Appearances, and condemn them for oppo&s;ers of Gods Work, who labour to un|deceive People about the&s;e Fits, by a&s;cribing them to an inferior Cau&s;e?</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> If any do u&s;e un&s;criptural Methods, to fur|ther &s;uch Appearances I think it is blame worthy, and have always been of this Mind; but I know of none who condemn Per&s;ons, as Oppo&s;ers of God's Work, meerly for their <HI>labouring to undeceive People about the afore&s;aid Fits, &amp;c.</HI> Our Author with much Art and Sophi&s;try, mi&s;repre&s;ents the true State of the Ca&s;e, both ways, fir&s;t by in&s;inuating that there are many Per&s;ons, who take Pains to promote <HI>animal Convul&s;ions,</HI> as their principal Aim; this I cannot think is true. Any that have encou|raged &s;uch Appearances, have had chiefly in their View the increa&s;ing and fixing that Soul Concern, which preceeds Conver&s;ion in the Adult: And is &s;ometimes accompany'd with &s;uch Appearances, be|cau&s;e of a greater degree of Di&s;tre&s;s which &s;ome endure in their Minds, which from the nearne&s;s of the Union between Soul and Body, mu&s;t needs have greater Influence upon it. If a &s;udden View of &s;ome great temporal Imergent does &s;ometimes Occa&s;ion the greate&s;t bodily Di&s;orders Why then &s;hou'd it be tho't &s;trange, if Things of infinitely greater Weight and Moment when view'd in equal Points of Light, do produce equal Effects?</P>
<P>And on the other Hand, he wou'd in&s;inuate, as if the chief Cau&s;e why many are condemned, as Oppo&s;ers of the Work of God, is becau&s;e they
<PB N="49" REF="005297_0049_1016F5B456452C00">
only endeavour, to give Per&s;ons a ju&s;t Notion a|bout tho&s;e bodily Commotions.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The Ca&s;e is not &s;o, we are glad that Peo|ple have ju&s;t Notions about &s;uch Appearances, we know the Work of God is very di&s;tinct from them. But we charge this <HI>Examiner,</HI> and others of his Stamp, with oppo&s;ing of God's Work, becau&s;e they &s;peak diminutively of it altogether, and u&s;e the afore&s;aid bodily Commotions artfully, as an Engine to black|en the whole Work. This Charge &s;ticks &s;o fa&s;t to the <HI>Examiner</HI> and others of his Brethren; that tho' <HI>they wa&s;h them with Nitre and take much Sope, yet their Iniquity is mark'd before God.</HI></P>
<P>And now we are prepared, to li&s;ten to what the <HI>Examiner</HI> offers in his next Paragraph, which is as follows. <Q>But is it not Matter of Fact, when many of the Hearers of &s;ome Preachers fall in|to Convul&s;ion-like Fits, and roar'd, that the u&s;ual Note of &s;uch Preachers then was, <HI>will any of you come to Chri&s;t?</HI> When at the &s;ame Time they pronounc'd heavy Cur&s;es upon &s;uch, as took not &s;uch fits, as being hard hearted Phari&s;ees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> As to the fir&s;t Part of the Charge, &s;ome Per|&s;ons of eminence in Religion do think the Method therein arraign'd is ju&s;tifiable, but for my own Part, I cannot &s;ee the expediency of it.</P>
<P>As to the latter Part of it, it is ambiguous, <Q>It is &s;aid they pronounc'd heavy Cur&s;es upon &s;uch, as took not &s;uch Fits, as being hard hearted Pha|ri&s;ees.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> If the Objector means all &s;uch, it is doubt|le&s;s a fal&s;e Charge: For it has never been &s;ugge&s;t|ed, &s;o far as I can learn, even by oppo&s;ers, that any who favour'd God's Work believ'd, that the Regenerate mu&s;t undergo &s;uch bodily Commotion; and can it be tho't that any but mad Men wou'd pronounce Cur&s;es upon the Regenerate! But madne&s;s has not yet, that I remember been charged upon the late awakening Preachers, (this way) If the
<PB N="50" REF="005297_0050_1016F5B7123AF248">
Objector only means that <HI>&s;ome took not,</HI> as his Phra&s;e is, <HI>&s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> namely, the unconverted, then might not the Preachers pronounce Cur&s;es upon &s;uch? The Objector didn't &s;ay that heavy Cur&s;es were pronounced upon Per&s;ons, <HI>meerly</HI> becau&s;e they didn't take &s;uch Fits. But if it be in&s;inuated by the afore|&s;aid Objection, that any of tho&s;e Preachers who have favour'd the late Reformation, were of Opinion that enduring of bodily Commotions, was of ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity to <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> it is a fal&s;e invidious Slander contrary to common Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> has not done with the <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Mi|ni&s;ters yet, he goes on to &s;ay in his next Paragraph thus <Q>Again the&s;e Reverend Gentlemen &s;ay, this our dear Brother, entred into Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Labour's, that is in other Words, Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> planted and Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> watered, as if the Go&s;|pel had never been planted or watered in this Wilderne&s;s, before the&s;e Rev. Me&s;&s;ieurs, intro|duced the Practice of itinerary Preaching.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Admirable! That a Man of &s;o much Cha|rity as our Author pretends to, could not find a more favourable Glo&s;s upon that Pa&s;&s;age, of the Rev. Mini&s;ters of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> will not the Words bear this ea&s;y Sen&s;e, namely, <Q>that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> was us'd by the Almighty, as a Mean of reviving Religion remarkably in <HI>New-England,</HI> and that it pleas'd the Sovereign God, to u&s;e me al&s;o in carrying on the &s;ame begun Work?</Q> Is it not contrary to common Sen&s;e, to which our Author appeals in his Title Page, to imagine that the worthy Gentlemen mean't otherwi&s;e? It is very cro&s;s grain'd in the <HI>Exami|ner,</HI> to ca&s;t &s;o much Dirt at the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> who are above his Di&s;dain (and will be e&s;teem'd by the Devout and Judicious whether he will or not) and that meerly becau&s;e they have a favourable Opinion, of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> and my &s;elf, and that ble&s;&s;ed Work of God, which we thro' pure Grace have been in&s;trumental to promote. But me thinks the <HI>Examiner</HI> had better be good Humour'd, for tho'

he &s;hou'd fret him&s;elf never &s;o much while there is Piety in <HI>New-England,</HI> there will not be want|ing &s;ome, among both the Clergy and Laity, who will think and &s;peak honourably of that Work, which he de&s;pi&s;es!</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to con&s;ider our Authors next Pa|ragraph, and this he has tho't proper to borrow, from the Lucubrations of the malignant Oppo&s;ers of Religion this Way.

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Doubtle&s;s our Author approv'd of this Pa&s;|&s;age, otherwi&s;e he would not have borrow'd it. Here let the Reader ob&s;erve in the&s;e Words, a Te&s;timony to the great Succe&s;s of Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and my &s;elf, extorted from the Pens of our Ene|mies, and that even at a Time, when they were endeavouring to run us both down, and the ble&s;&s;ed Work of <HI>Conviction</HI> and <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> which we have been endeavouring to promote. This puts me in mind of an old Proverb, viz. <HI>magna e&s;t veritas &amp; preva|lebit,</HI> i. e. <HI>great is the Truth and will prevail.</HI> But in the mean Time &s;et the Reader ob&s;erve, that the afore|&s;aid con&s;trained Te&s;timony, is contrary to what the&s;e Men have &s;aid in other Parts of their Writ|ing, one Example of which, I &s;hall only mention at pre&s;ent for brevity's &s;ake, expre&s;s'd in their Ex|amination of my Remarks <HI>pag.</HI> 107. 8. 9. thus <Q>We &s;hall not be &s;o ra&s;h as to pretend to judge Mat|ters before the Time, <HI>i. e.</HI> whether there be Truth in the Account as to &s;ome In&s;tances: For that is no Part of our Debate; for we know but our Part of what is manife&s;t.

there be &s;uch a <HI>Eutopia</HI> as Mr <HI>Tennent</HI> here de&s;cribes, &s;omewhere in di&s;tant Parts; for we live at Home: But yet if Men will allow us the Rights of private Judgment, we think it is but ju&s;t we &s;hould be allow'd to &s;u&s;pend our Belief in the Point, till we hear &s;ome valid Proofs, or el&s;e are invited to come and &s;ee: For a Partyman's <HI>Say &s;o</HI> in one Ear, when Experience contradicts it loudly in both, is too feeble to beget Faith. For tho' we &s;hould grant that in Times of yore, when Men were all that is good and de&s;ireable, &s;ubject to no Mi&s;takes, and &s;poke no Fal&s;hoods in their own or their Friends Behalf, if ever there was &s;uch a Time; Men's, own ver|bal Declarations for them&s;elves, might pa&s;s for valid Proofs of their inward Graces; and it might be counted a daring Piece of Pre&s;uming Boldne&s;s, to oppo&s;e an Argument which depended upon &s;uch &s;table Maxims, which like the <HI>koinai enoiai,</HI> are never to be denied, &s;uch as are, <HI>ask his fel|low, whether he be a Thief,</HI> &amp;c. But &s;ince <HI>Pando|ra</HI>'s Box is opened, our Saviour has broke down this Claim, by &s;aying, <HI>If I bear witne&s;s of my Self, my Witne&s;s is not true.</HI> And when Experience tells us, that in this Iron Age, a fluent Orator with his orient Colours, will in&s;tantly fill the Wrin|kles of the mo&s;t furrow'd Face, and again deform the mo&s;t beautiful Complexion, ju&s;t as Mr <HI>Pain|ter</HI> plea&s;es, or as <HI>good Will</HI> or <HI>ill Will</HI> prompts him. Seeing therefore we have not a large Stock enough of Time and Candles to run thro' the Woods to find out Mr. <HI>Tennent's Eutopia:</HI> For it is the Cry of many, and that in many different Places, that &s;olid Religion &s;eems to loo&s;e Ground fa&s;ter, &amp; Vice and Debauchery &s;eem to gain more Ground in one Year, &s;ince this new Commotion, than they gain before in Ten; and that a|mong tho&s;e who appear debauch'd there are more than a few of tho&s;e who were lately famous for their being Cryers, and Fallers, and Pretend|ers

to Convictions, &amp;c. We hope therefore, that Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> will in his next tell us, where to find this fine Reformation, otherwi&s;e we de&s;pair of coming at it.

<P>It is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s, at pre&s;ent, to expo&s;e the va|rious Ab&s;urdities of this Paragraph, only the Rea|der may plainly &s;ee, that it is full to the Purpo&s;e that I brought it for.

Here you may &s;ee, the extent of his Charity and Humility. The afore&s;aid Mini&s;ters have &s;hewn, what they take to be the Work of God, and what they mean to pa|tronize; in their Preface to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Jonathan Dicken&s;on</HI>'s excellent DIALOGUES; lately printed at <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> which are a rational and nervous De|fence, of the late revival of Religion in this Land. The&s;e Rev.

<P>But this Author proceeds to &s;ay, <Q>there are ma|ny wild <HI>Di&s;orders</HI> and <HI>Confu&s;ions</HI> in &s;ome of our Churches, at this Day; which really re&s;emble the <HI>Corrinthian Di&s;orders,</HI> in the Times of the Apo&s;|tles.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This is likely to be true, and the Ca&s;e is much to be lamented! but are not the proper Cau|&s;es thereof, the Enmity, and Policy of <HI>Satan,</HI> and evil Men in oppo&s;ing the Power of Religion? <HI>This, this,</HI> is the real Cau&s;e!

<P>The <HI>Examiner</HI> farther adds, <Q>Nece&s;&s;ity is there|fore laid upon the faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t; to bear publick and &s;ea&s;onable Te&s;timony again&s;t them; and pity tho&s;e Rev. Gentlemen, let &s;lip &s;o good an Opportunity, as this to do it.</Q></P>

No not a Word of that; but he is griev'd, that they have not reproved me, in their Preface, for <HI>Di&s;orders, Con|fu&s;ions, &amp;c.</HI> "Pity it is &s;ays he." Poor Man!

<HI>Key,</HI> as I humbly conceive better &s;uited to the <HI>Lock</HI> But in the mean Time, mu&s;t beg leave to offer &s;ome few Reflections upon the afore&s;aid Paragraph. Here then let us enquire, whether the Characters of a <HI>Fox,</HI> as repre&s;ented by Mr. <HI>Helenbrook,</HI> do realy belong to me, or to the <HI>Examiner?</HI> The</P>
<P N="1"><Q>1&s;t. Of which is, that they have Holes, Mr. <HI>Helenbrook</HI> adds, <HI>Foxes</HI> that they may the better conceal them&s;elves, &s;ub&s;i&s;t not &s;o much above Ground, as in Holes and Caverns, under the Earth. &mdash;Hereticks and Seducers always endeavour to hide their Doctrines, and Opinions, and keep them as &s;ecret as they can, certain it is, that they don't pre&s;ently and openly appear to the World, but know how to hide them&s;elves, under &s;ly Shifts.</Q> Thus far he.</P>
<P>Now I appeal to the World, whether I have not acted a very contrary Part? I have appear'd open|ly upon the Stage of the World, and declar'd the Truths of Chri&s;t freely and plainly, and in &s;ecret have I &s;aid nothing. I have fairly and above board, ventur'd my Name and Character, in the Defence thereof, and of vital Religion; who can with any ju&s;tice &s;ay, that I have endeavour'd, to conceal my Opinions or Name? But as for our <HI>Examiner,</HI> does he not Sculk in a Hole, and Ca|vern as it were; and &s;crene his Name behind the Curtain; while he is labouring to de&s;troy mine? and is he not very backward, as to the Di&s;covery of his Doctrines? It may be likewi&s;e here ob&s;erv'd, that the Oppo&s;ers of Religion, while the bright Day of the Power of Divine Grace &s;hin'd forth in the late rivival of Piet, they like other noxious Animals of the Night, cautiou&s;ly and craftily kept their Holes, for Fear of the Wor&s;t, &s;o that hardly any of them dars't appear to oppo&s;e in o|pen Day; but &s;o &s;oon as a Night of &s;piritual De|&s;ertion came on, in re&s;pect of God's withdrawing the Influences of his Spirit,; as well as of the Falls of &s;ome Profe&s;&s;ors; into erronious Opinions, im|prudent

Conduct, or bad Practices. I &s;ay, &s;o &s;oon as the Darkne&s;s came on, what Crouds of <HI>Foxes</HI> came out of their Holes, and fill'd the Neighbour|ing Air with their bold Barkings, as if it would be always Night? But &s;tay, may be a gracious God may cau&s;e the Sun to break out with his &s;alutary Rays, and frighten the <HI>Foxes</HI> to their Holes again; which may God grant for Chri&s;t's &s;ake Amen, let all Chri&s;t's Sheep and Lambs, &s;ay Amen.</P>
<P>Another Character of <HI>Foxes,</HI> mentioned by the <HI>Examiner</HI> is, that they have many Ways and Pa&s;&s;a|ges to come out at, &amp;c. It depends upon our Author to prove, wherein I have us'd Re&s;erves, Backdoors, and Equivocations; which I am con|&s;cious he will never be able to do, and therefore is a fal&s;e Accu&s;er: The harmonious Sy&s;tem of Truths, which I have, and do &s;till believe, has laid me under no Temptation, to u&s;e &s;uch mean Ar|tifices.</P>
<P>But as to the <HI>Examiner,</HI> I will not undertake to clear him of the&s;e Things, &s;eeing he favours a Party of Men, that are famous for them, and does what has a direct Tendency, to ob&s;truct the U&s;efulne&s;s of a Book fram'd to hinder their corrupt Influence. It is an old Saying that <HI>(Simile &s;imili gaudet) like rejoyces in like.</HI> Do not Birds of a Feather-flock together?</P>
<P>The next Character of <HI>Foxes,</HI> is Craft and De|ceit, which our Author gives no proof of as to me, and which I am &s;ure he cannot, and is therefore a fal&s;e Accu&s;er. I may with ju&s;tice apply to my Manner of Proceeding, what the Ap&s;tole <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays of him&s;elf, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.3, 6. <HI>For our Exhortation was not of Deceit, nor in Guile, even &s;o we &s;peak not as plea&s;ing Men, but GOD, which tryeth our Hearts: For neither at any Time, u&s;ed we flattering Words, as ye know, nor a Cloak of Coveteou&s;ne&s;s, God is Witne&s;s, not of Men &s;ought we Glory.</HI> My <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon, which the <HI>Examiner</HI> is &s;o much di&s;pleas'd with, is a Proof of this. If I had been a deceitful Flatterer, or Men plea&s;er,
<PB N="62" REF="005297_0062_1016F5D8ED1E1C20">
I wou'd not have u&s;ed &s;uch Plaine&s;s and Acrimo|ny, in that Sermon, as I knew according to the common Cour&s;e of Things, would expo&s;e me to much ill will, and Reproach from the ungodly. But I &s;hall leave it to the Reader to judge, whether this <HI>Examiner</HI> has not us'd, much <HI>Craft</HI> and <HI>Deceit,</HI> in the fal&s;e Charges I have already &s;poke to, as well as in repre&s;enting the State of the Ca&s;e, with re|&s;pect to the Friends and Oppo&s;ers of the late re|vival of Religion, while he endeavour'd to tear down the Life of it with all his Might, <Q>and has not this a Tendency to cheat and decoy le&s;s harmle&s;s Creatures, and make a Prey of them? As Mr. <HI>Helenbrook</HI> ob&s;erves, concerning the <HI>Foxes, pag.</HI> 9.</Q></P>
<P>The next particular our Author mentions, <HI>pag.</HI> 11. is this, <Q><HI>Foxes,</HI> that they may not be &s;o ea&s;i|ly en&s;nared, &s;eldom run right forward, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I ble&s;s God, that I have the Te&s;timony of my Con&s;cience, that in Simplicity, and Godly Sincerity; I have had my Conver&s;ation in the World. I tru&s;t it will appear, by my An&s;wers to this Gen|tlemans Objections; that this Charge is without Foundation. But I believe it will be hard, if prac|ticable, to clear our Author of this Property of the <HI>Fox:</HI> For &s;ometimes in this Pamphlet, he profe&s;&s;es Charity and blames me for the Want of it; and yet betrays a &s;eries of the mo&s;t virulent Malignity, in publi&s;hing notorious Fal&s;hoods a|gain&s;t me, &s;everal of which have been already con|&s;idered: In one Place <HI>pag.</HI> 9. he owns Mr. <HI>White|field</HI>'s, and my great Succe&s;s, and <HI>pag.</HI> 24. he denies that we had any Succe&s;s at all, but <HI>pag.</HI> 30. he owns that we had &s;ome. As to the <HI>Moravians, pag.</HI> 11. he &s;peaks again&s;t them, in re&s;pect of their wild and frightful Errors, <HI>pag.</HI> 20. he makes an Apology for them <HI>pag.</HI> 26 he acknowledges their unfair Dealings; and yet the Tendency of his whole Performance, is to hinder the Influence of that Book, which I
<PB N="63" REF="005297_0063_1016F5DBA6A49018">
wrote again&s;t them; from giving check to their pe&s;tilent Notions. As to the Work of God, <HI>pag.</HI> 8. he &s;hews his Regret, that the <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Mini&s;ters betray'd too great a likeing to it, and yet <HI>pag.</HI> 10 and 30. he owns the Reality of it, in &s;ome degree; but in <HI>pag.</HI> 10. he again denies it all together, un|der the Notion of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pranks.</HI></P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to con&s;ider, the next Character; and that is a &s;ly Way <HI>of creeping into other Holes, and of turning other Animals; out of their rightful Po&s;e&s;&s;ions;</HI> this the Accu&s;er him&s;elf, as con&s;cious of his Guilt, &s;tops as it were half way in the Application of, and no wonder, for the Charge is fal&s;e and &s;landerous. I have not &s;lyly crept into the Congregations of orthodox Mini&s;ters, <HI>and turn'd them out of their Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions by poi&s;onous Errors,</HI> as <HI>Helenbrook</HI> Expre&s;&s;es it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FORASMUCH as a Letter of mine to Mr. <HI>Dick|in&s;on,</HI> the la&s;t of February, together with a Po&s;t|&s;cript, lately printed in the <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> weekly News-Paper, has occa&s;ioned various Reflections; I have tho't it not improper (being thereunto excited by &s;ome Friends) to &s;hew my Intention in &s;ome Pa&s;|&s;ages contained therein, which are more liable to Mi&s;con&s;truction. I profe&s;s that when I wrote the afore&s;aid Letter and Po&s;t&s;cript, I had not the lea&s;t Thought of their Publication; neither have I at any Time con&s;ented thereto; and truly, the Po&s;t&s;cript was wrote in much Ha&s;te.</P>
<P>As to my Confe&s;&s;ion of Mi&s;managment in the Affair of Debate with the Synod, it re&s;pected on|ly the Defects which I conceived attended my Manner of Performing, what I did then and do &s;till look upon to be Duty. I was not then, nor have not been &s;ince, convinced that the Matter or Sub&s;tance of what I contended for was Wrong, and the Words of the Letter con&s;idered in their Connection, will ea&s;ily bear this Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the Po&s;t&s;cript, altho' I que&s;tion not Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI>'s Piety and Integrity, and hope that he has been an In&s;trument of &s;pecial Good to di|vers Per&s;ons; yet I cannot approve of &s;ome of his Methods of Proceeding (according to the Re|pre&s;entation which many give of them) and, par|ticularly, all the In&s;tances in the Po&s;t&s;cript, are in my Opinion very exceptionable and of hurt|ful Tendency.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me very unrea&s;onable that any thing &s;hould be made a Term of Communion which cannot certainly be known by the Church; and &s;uch doubtle&s;s, are Men's gracious Experiences, the &s;ecret Rece&s;&s;es of the Heart, and Springs of Action, are only open to the all penetrating Eye
<PB N="65" REF="005297_0065_1016F5E4146E3598">
of God: Yet &s;eeing a probable Knowledge of Men's States towards God, may be attained by an Examination of Men's Principles, Experiences and Practice, Mini&s;ters no doubt ought to en|quire into the State of their Flock, and deal faithfully and di&s;creetly with Per&s;ons in a pri|vate Way according as Things appear to them.</P>
<P>As to the Practice of &s;etting up &s;eparate Meetings, upon the &s;uppo&s;ed Unregeneracy of the Pa&s;tors of Places, it is, in my Judgment, of un|happy Con&s;equence to the Church's Peace and Purity, when the Mini&s;ters, &s;uppo&s;ed to be un|converted, are &s;ound in Principle, regular in Practice, and Favourers of the Work of God.</P>
<P>But when Mini&s;ters con&s;pire to blacken and oppo&s;e habitually the late memorable Revival of God's Work in this Land, and brand the Whole of it with Terms of the utmo&s;t Contempt and Ig|nominy; then; I &s;ee not how any that fear God can &s;it contentedly under their Mini&s;trations (if they per&s;i&s;t as afore&s;aid) without becoming acce&s;|&s;ary to their crim&s;on Guilt.</P>
<P>Altho' there be no Probability of unconverted Mini&s;ters being near &s;o &s;erviceable to the Salvati|on of Mankind, as Per&s;ons of another Character; yet, doubtle&s;s, the &s;overeign God makes their Labours of &s;ome U&s;e, at Times, for the In&s;tructi|on and Reformation of Mankind.</P>
<P>As to the Practice of openly expo&s;ing Mini|&s;ters, &s;ound in Doctrine, blamele&s;s in Life, and Favourers of God's Work (who are &s;uppo|&s;ed by &s;ome to be unconverted) in publick Di&s;|cour&s;es, in their own Pulpits, by calling of them by their Names pronouncing Sentence again&s;t their internal State, and exhorting their People to for&s;ake their Mini&s;try; this, I think is a very extraordinary and unaccountable Me|thod of Proceeding, without any Precedent, that I know of, in Scripture, or Church-Hi&s;tory; it directly tends to tear the Body of Chri&s;t in Pie|ces,
<PB N="66" REF="005297_0066_1016F5E5A67B22A0">
and to procure a manifold and pregnant In|jury to all the valuable Intere&s;ts of &s;incere Re|ligion.</P>
<P>As to the Practice of &s;ending out unlearned Men into the Mini&s;try, in ordinary Ca&s;es, upon the Suppo&s;ition of their Piety, it has been always, and &s;till is my Sentiment concerning it, that it ju&s;tly de&s;erves the Character given it in the Po&s;t|&s;cript.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, I cannot perceive either Decency or Expediency, in &s;inging in the Streets; but on the contrary, it &s;eems to mini&s;ter Occa&s;ion to the Adver&s;aries of Religion to revile and bla&s;pheme.</P>
<P>In fine, altho' I freely own the ab&s;olute Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;uppernatural Illumination and divine Energy, in order to the &s;aving In&s;truction of Men's Minds and Renovation of their Hearts; yet I cannot but di&s;claim all Pretence to immediate In&s;piration or objective Revelation, all following of immediate Impul&s;es without Con&s;ulting the Word of God, and the Dictates of right Rea&s;on, as an enthu&s;ia&s;tical and perilous <HI>Ignis fatuus,</HI> which may lead its delued Votaries into the &s;trange&s;t Ab&s;urdities in Opinion, and mo&s;t enor|mous Evils in Practice.</P>

your&s;elf Sir, and that from a better Foundation; it is you Sir, who is de&s;troying the Vines and tender Grapes, who is artfully and cruelly a&s;per&s;ing Gods Work and Servants; and in the mean Time excu&s;ing <HI>Hereticks, Enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Schi&s;maticks;</HI> may God forgive your Iniquity.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> goes on to &s;ay, <HI>pag.</HI> 11. <Q>I &s;hall follow the &s;ame Method Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> has taken with the <HI>Moravians,</HI> and compare his Sermon preach'd at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> with his late <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> and <HI>Appendix,</HI> in <HI>di&s;tinct Columns;</HI> or, in other Words, &s;et <HI>Gilbert</HI> again&s;t <HI>Tennent,</HI> for the Rea|ders ea&s;e in finding out the Truth.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Either the <HI>Examiner</HI>'s Under&s;tanding, or his Veracity fails him here; I have not taken the &s;ame Method, with the <HI>Moravians</HI> which he takes with me, in &s;etting Pa&s;&s;ages of any of their Writings, in a &s;uppos'd Oppo&s;ition to each other, in Di&s;tinct Col|lumns. I have only &s;et the COUNTS Words in one Collumn, and &s;ome Ob&s;ervations of my own, upon the other: But its like this Author wanted &s;ome Umbrage, true, or fal&s;e, for his contemptuous Manner of treating me.</P>
<P>And now we are arriv'd at his Collumns, in which as he &s;ays <Q>We are to meet with contradictions, as impo&s;&s;ible to be reconcil'd, as to unite the Poles; and with two &s;et of Principles, as oppo|&s;ite to each other, as the Heatheni&s;h Principles, of a good and evil God.</Q> Well, tho' the Time of working Miracles be ceas'd, yet I'll put on a little Courage, and try to unite the Poles.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t In&s;tance, of pretended Contradiction is this, <HI>pag.</HI> 11. 12. borrow'd from the 47. <HI>pag.</HI> of my <HI>Mor. Serm.</HI> The Words are the&s;e, <Q>In my Opinion a Di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eparate from a true Church, becau&s;e many of her Members are unconverted, and &s;ome are under Deadne&s;s, is a &s;ign of a proud Spirit; were not the Phari&s;ees of old proud Separati&s;ts? See this apply'd to the <HI>Mora|vians,</HI> in <HI>pag.</HI> 63.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="005297_0068_1016F5EC38A24A80">Compare his Sermon at <HI>Nottingham, pag.</HI> 12. of the la&s;t Edition under the &s;econd Inference, <Q>we may learn, that &s;uch who are contented under a dead Mini&s;try, have not in them, the Temper of that Saviour, they profe&s;s, it is an awful Sign, they are as blind as Moles, and as dead Stones, with|out any &s;piritual Ta&s;te or Reli&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>Well, where is the Contradiction? I &s;uppo&s;e our Author thinks, it lyes in this; that in one of tho&s;e Sermons, I &s;ay, that a Di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eparate from a true Church, &amp;c. is a Sign of a true Spirit, and in the other, that &s;uch who are contented under a dead Mini&s;try, have not the Temper of that Sa|viour they profe&s;s. Here is &s;carce any Appearance of Contradiction, much le&s;s Reality.</P>
<P>But that my Meaning in the <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon, may be the better under&s;tood, let this Paragraph be added, which immediately follows, what was cited by the <HI>Examiner,</HI> namely, <Q>Our Lord allows, the Wheat and Tares to grow together, 'till Harve&s;t; but &s;ome ra&s;h Zealots, are for parting them, or plucking them up directly, altho' they thereby ri&s;quo the Safety of the Wheat.</Q> There|fore that which I oppos'd in this Sermon, was &s;uch an uncharitable and irregular Breach of Com|munion, from the vi&s;ible Church, as the <HI>Labadi&s;ts</HI> were guilty of formerly in <HI>Holland;</HI> who pretended to form a perfect Church, as to its Members, i. e. to admit none but &s;incere Per&s;ons to Communion. And this they tho't they cou'd certainly know, and therefore made their Knowledge as to the in|ternal State, a Term of Communion. They &s;o &s;e|parated them&s;elves from the Church of <HI>Holland,</HI> as to make a new Sect. The afore&s;aid Paragraphs I wrote with a De&s;ign to give Check as far as I could, to a cen&s;orious and divi&s;ive Temper, which I was inform'd was like to obtain, and do much Mi&s;chief in <HI>New England,</HI> which gave me great Unea&s;ine&s;s, for a long Time.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="005297_0069_1016F5EEEEFA0040">As to the Pa&s;&s;age cited from my <HI>Nottingham</HI> Ser|mon, which is in the 18th <HI>pag.</HI> of the fir&s;t Edition (for I have not &s;een the others) the following Words of the Paragraph, explain my Meaning fully, which are the&s;e, <Q>And alas is not this the Ca&s;e of Mul|titudes, if they can get one, who has the Name of a Mini&s;ter, with a Band, and a black Coat or Gown, to carry on a Sabbaoth Day among them, tho' never &s;o coldly and in&s;ucce&s;sfully. If he is free from gro&s;s Crimes in Practice, and takes good Care to keep at a due Di&s;tance from their Con&s;ciences, and is never troubled about his In|&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s. O think the poor Fools, that is a fine Man indeed, our Mini&s;ter is a prudent cha|ritable Man, he is not always harping upon Terror, and &s;ounding Damnation in our Ears, like &s;ome ra&s;h headed Preachers, who by their uncharita|ble Methods, are ready to put poor People out of their Wits, or to run them into De&s;pair: O! How terrible a Thing is that De&s;pair! Ay, our Mini&s;ter hone&s;t Man, gives us good Caution again&s;t it.</Q></P>
<P>Well, and is not this a real Truth, as well as what is &s;aid in the other Paragraph? Does not our Author &s;hew, what &s;ort of a Spirit, he is of, by <HI>muttering</HI> again&s;t it?</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e two Sermons, cited by our <HI>Examiner</HI> don't re&s;pect the &s;ame Thing, and there|fore there cannot be a Contradiction in them. The one relates to an <HI>irregular uncharitable Separation,</HI> from a Church, becau&s;e of the &s;uppo&s;ed or real Un|regeneracy of &s;ome of her Members. The other relates to <HI>Contentedne&s;s</HI> uner a <HI>dead carnal</HI> carele&s;s Mi|ni&s;try, who do not preach clo&s;ely to the Con&s;ci|ence, or endeavour to awake Sinners at all. And wou'd our Author have People to be contented under &s;uch a Mini&s;try? O &s;hame! If our Author &s;uc|ceeds no better in his after Attempts, it wll cea&s;e to be a Miracle to <HI>unite the Poles.</HI> The</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="70" REF="005297_0070_1016F5F0745C8698">2d. In&s;tance, is borrow'd from <HI>pag.</HI> 63. of my la&s;t Sermons, which for Di&s;tinction's &s;ake, I may call my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermons, the Words are the&s;e, <Q>They have a Sheeps Coat on, they &s;eem to be mighty mild, harmle&s;s, and innocent in their Looks; but inwardly they hold dividing dange|rous Principles, like Wolves they cruelly &s;catter the poor Sheep of Chri&s;t, by their damnable Doctrines: Beware my dear Brethren, of the Leaven of the&s;e <HI>Moravians,</HI> who like the Pha|ri&s;ees of old, <HI>make broad Philacterys, and compa&s;s Sea and Land to make Pro&s;elytes.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The &s;uppos'd oppo&s;ite In&s;tance, to what has been now mentioned is taken from the 19 <HI>pag.</HI> of the <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon. The Words are the&s;e, <Q>If the Mini&s;try of natural Men, be as it has been re|pre&s;ented, then it is both lawful and expedient to go from them to hear godly Per&s;ons, yea it is &s;o far from being &s;inful to do this, that one who lives under a pious Mini&s;ter, of le&s;&s;er Gifts, af|ter having hone&s;tly endeavour'd to get Benefit by his Mini&s;try and gets little or none, but doth find real Benefit, and more Benefit el&s;ewhere, I &s;ay he may lawfully go, and that frequently, where he gets mo&s;t Good to his precious Soul.&mdash; let who will oppo&s;e it.</Q></P>
<P>But before I proceed to &s;hew the Harmony of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, I mu&s;t more generally ob&s;erve; that our Author u&s;es very unfair Methods, in order to make a Contradiction between them <HI>e. g.</HI> in the In|&s;tance he produces, out of the <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon; he leaves out of purpo&s;e, the&s;e following Lines of the Paragraph, which fully clears up my Meaning, and free me from the fal&s;e Charge of dividing Doc|trine, in which I &s;uppo&s;e, our Author immagined, to &s;hew a Contradiction, between this and the other Sermon. The Words left out are the&s;e, <Q>After regular Application to the Pa&s;tor where he lives, for his Con&s;ent, propo&s;ing the Rea&s;ons thereof, when this is done, in the Spirit of Love and
<PB N="71" REF="005297_0071_1016F5F2119AB6C0">
Meekne&s;s, without contempt of any, as al&s;o without ra&s;h Anger and vain Curio&s;ity.</Q> The&s;e Lines, our Author knew well enough wou'd &s;poil his Boa&s;t of a Contradiction, and therefore with more Art than Ho|ne&s;ty, he left them out.</P>
<P>Another Piece of unfair Dealing, under this Charge; is this, in&s;tead of the foregoing Words, which concluded the Paragraph in the Sermon, he skips like a <HI>Fox</HI> from the 19 to the 30 <HI>pag.</HI> and takes a Scrap of a Sentence from thence, which he adds to the other, namely, the&s;e Words, <HI>let who will oppo&s;e it,</HI> In order to repre&s;ent me, as &s;peaking directly contrary, both to my Intention and Expre&s;&s;|ion. The Words cited in the 30 <HI>pag.</HI> I never intend|ed, in any Sen&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent, with the Explication of my Opinion in the 19 <HI>pag.</HI> at this rate of proceed|ing, our Author might form Contradictions, in all Writings under the Sun, yea in the very &s;acred Scrip|tures them&s;elves! It is likewi&s;e I think unfair in him, under this Charge, to put his own Words in in one of the Collumns, in Oppo&s;ition to mine: His Words are the&s;e, <Q>and it is the Language of &s;everal Pages, under his 4th Inference, be ye &s;eparate.</Q></P>
<P>Well, where is the Contradiction, between the Pa&s;&s;ages afore&s;aid, of the&s;e Sermons? Becau&s;e I a&s;&s;ert, the Lawfulne&s;s, of a <HI>Peacefull charitable</HI> and <HI>regular withdrawing</HI> from the Stated hearing of one Mini&s;ter to another, of the &s;ame denomination, when greater Good is got: Does this ju&s;tify an <HI>irregular uncharitable Separa|ration,</HI> from a true Church? And the making of a different Sect? How triffling, and invidious is this In&s;tance? And thus I tru&s;t the Reader perceives, that the Poles again are united. We &s;hall not be put to much Difficulty, if our Author does not bring more weighty Objections. A</P>
<P N="3">3d. In&s;tance of pretended Contradiction, is bor|row'd <HI>pag.</HI> 48 of my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon, where I &s;peak thus <Q>It is al&s;o an In&s;tance of Pride, to de&s;pi&s;e

<P>The &s;uppos'd oppo&s;ite In&s;tance, to what has been mentioned, is as follows, <Q>alas how could Mr <HI>T.</HI>&mdash; preach and print this, after printing his Sermon at <HI>Notingham,</HI> without expre&s;&s;ing deep Repentance for the hard contemptuous Speeches he has there pour'd upon the Body of the Clergy of this Ge|neration? Doth not this &s;avour of Pride, and Uncharitablene&s;s? I &s;hall beg Leave here to lay before my Readers, &s;ome of the reproach|ful Language, he has plentifully be&s;tow'd upon the Body of the Clergy, of this Generation; as the Synod of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> has lately collected it to my Hand, out of the &s;ame Sermon.

<P>The pretended Contradiction, between the afore|&s;aid Pa&s;&s;ages, I conceive to be <HI>this,</HI> that in one of the Sermons, I &s;ay that it is an In&s;tance of Pride, to &s;light Mini&s;ters or People, that are unconverted, &amp;c.

It is no evidence either of Pride, or Uncha|ritablene&s;s, to give unconverted Mini&s;ters their proper Titles, and Characters; for if &s;o, our Lord him&s;elf mu&s;t be guilty of the afore&s;aid Crimes; for he gave them hard Terms or Names al&s;o.

See then how the Spi|rit of God in the Scriptures &s;tigmatizes the wicked, they are termed <HI>Captives,</HI> I&s;. 61.1. <HI>Rebels,</HI> Rom 8.7. <HI>Bond&s;laves,</HI> Acts. 8.23. <HI>Sluggards,</HI> Pro. 6.9. <HI>Blind Men,</HI> Mat 23.26. <HI>thou Blind Phari&s;ee, Fools,</HI> P&s;. 14.1. <HI>Dead Men,</HI> Ephe. 2.1. <HI>Madmen,</HI> Eccle&s;. 9.3.

<P>Of all human Creatures wicked Mini&s;ters, who habitually oppo&s;e the very Work of Gods Spirit, and mask their Enmity with Religious Pretences, are the Wor&s;t, e&s;pecially if this is done again&s;t Conviction and with Malice, a&s;cribing it to a bad Cau&s;e! This as I humbly conceive, is the Sin again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, which &s;hall not find forgivene&s;s in this Life, or that to come. This was the Sin of the Phari&s;ees, <HI>tho&s;e orderly Hypocrites;</HI> again&s;t which the Zeal of our Lord, the meek Lamb of God burned and &s;parkled with &s;o great Flame! as has been al|ready expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>Now Reader ob&s;erve, what tho' I have given unconverted Mini&s;ters bad Names; yet &s;eeing they de&s;erve them, it is no more but an Act of Ju&s;tice in one re&s;pect; but under another Con&s;ideration it is an Act of Love to God and Man, or rather a &s;igh thereof: It manife&s;ts Love to God, while in faith|fulne&s;s

to him we ri&s;que our Reputation, in detect|ing and oppo&s;ing his Enemies, and e&s;pecially when they are di&s;honouring his Name and Work, and endeavouring to de&s;troy his Kingdom: Be&s;ides, Love to Man is hereby di&s;cover'd, in &s;hewing to ungodly Mini&s;ters, their own dreadful Picture: For this has a Tendency to awaken and humble them, and turn them to God. I have no Prejudice again&s;t any of them upon the Face of the Earth, tho' they have labour'd to de&s;troy my Character and U&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>I would to God, I could do them Good by Night or Day: My Heart within pities them; neither have I us'd har&s;h Epithets out of Indignation to their Per&s;ons, but their Ways, as I have ob&s;erved in the Preface to this <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon, in the&s;e Words. <Q>So far as I know my Heart it is Grief for the Injurys that have been done to the Church of God by natural Mini&s;ters, that has extorted &s;uch Acrimony from my Pen.</Q> The Oppo&s;ition that &s;ome, this Way, have made again&s;t the Work of God in this Land, their murdering the Con|victions of divers Per&s;ons, their thru&s;ting out, as I am credibly informed, unexperienced loo&s;e Men into the Mini&s;try, and their oppo&s;ing the coming in of Pious Candidates into the Church, has long di&s;tre&s;&s;ed my Soul, and fill'd me with Sorrow and Indignation both.</P>
<P>And by repre&s;enting the ju&s;t Characters of the ungodly Clergy, Love is hereby expre&s;&s;ed to Mankind, in warning them of their Danger, and exciting them, to their Duty, in cho&s;ing of, and ap|plying to the be&s;t Means. Our Author doubtle&s;s knows that the Meaning of the Word Charity (agape) is Love.</P>
<P>Neither does it Savour of Pride, to give ungodly Mini&s;ters &s;uch Names as &s;uit their <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> and <HI>Cour&s;e:</HI> For this is out to follow the Example that our Lord Je&s;us, and the Eternal Spirit have &s;et before us,

as well as divers of Gods faithful Servants of Old, &s;uch as <HI>Jeremiah, Paul,</HI> &amp;c. And thus the pretended Contradiction is remov'd</P>
<P>But to make this Ca&s;e appear the more Plain, I &s;hall take leave to ob&s;erve, how unfairly our Au|thor and his Friends have treated me, under this 3d In&s;tance. For 1&s;t. he puts his own Words in one of the Collumns over again&s;t mine, it &s;hould have been my own Words and not his; for his Bu&s;ine&s;s was, according to his Propo&s;al, not to &s;hew a difference between him and me, for that probably is wide enough, but between me and my|&s;elf. A 2d unfair Method our Author u&s;es here, is his citing after his own Words, a Collection of Words, pick'd up here and there out of the <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon by my Opponents; he ought to have cited my own Words, in compleat Sentences in the Order I put them, and not broken &s;hreads mar&s;hald by my Enemys, in &s;uch a Shape as might appear mo&s;t formidable, in order to render me odi|ous among gracele&s;s Creatures, who are very fond of a blind Charity, upon a &s;elfi&s;h Account, namely, to &s;ave their Bakon. A 3d. In&s;tance of unfair Dealing in our Author under this Head, is his a&s;&s;erting that I be&s;tow reproachful Language, upon the Body of the Clergy of this Generation, his manner of Expre&s;&s;ion, together with his Artful concealing of the Word <HI>unconverted,</HI> plainly intimates that I, according to his Repre&s;entation, charg'd the Body of the Clergy of this Generation, with the afore|&s;aid Epithets, ab&s;olutely and directly, which is Fal&s;e and Sophi&s;tical, I have charg'd unconverted Mini&s;ters with them directly and ab&s;olutely; but as to the Body of the Clergy, the Charge comes in a|gain&s;t them indirectly and hipothetically, on Ac|count of my Opinion about their State. I cannot but &s;till think that the greater Part of the Clergy is unconverted, and that for Rea&s;ons mention'd in that Sermon. <HI>Strait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leads to Life, and few there be that find it, not

many Wi&s;e, not many Noble, are call'd, the Harve&s;t truly is Plentious, but the Labourers are few.</HI> Saint <HI>Chri&s;o&s;tom</HI> has expre&s;s'd his Tho'ts of the Paucity of fatihful Mini&s;ters, in a much &s;tronger Light than I have done, for he tho't that Scarce any Mini&s;ters at all wou'd be &s;av'd.</P>
<P>Gracele&s;s Per&s;ons have a general Superficial groundle&s;s Notion concerning others Goodne&s;s, be|fore they them&s;elves are awakned and made to feel the Difficulties of Religion: But then their way of thinking of Chri&s;tianity, is alter'd in this Point, they neither weigh others nor them&s;elves in &s;uch light Scales as they were wont to do before.</P>
<P>But let it be here ob&s;erv'd, that I do not pre|tend to a like certainty, as to both the&s;e Points, namely; charging the afore&s;aid Epithets upon un|converted Mini&s;ters, and the Knowledge of the greatne&s;s of their Number, the fir&s;t is of undoubted certainty from the Word of God and right Rea&s;on; but the other is only highly probable. As to this Point I &s;hould be glad to be mi&s;taken in my O|pinion, but I am per&s;waded it is too true. But,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Another unfair Method of our Author and his Friends under this Head, <HI>is,</HI> their a&s;&s;ert|ing that I charge all the particular Epithets they mention upon the Body of the Clergy of this Ge|neration; which is fal&s;e, and cannot be prov'd from the Sermon: Indeed I believe they are all applicable to &s;ome of them; but they are not applicable to all of them. In &s;everal Paragraphs of the Sermon are li|mitted Words, which clear me from the afore&s;aid Charge. In <HI>pag.</HI> 12. are the&s;e Words, <Q>many Mi|ni&s;ters, <HI>pag.</HI> 19. many Phari&s;ee Teachers, have got a long String of Prayer.</Q> And in the &s;ame <HI>pag.</HI> the Word <HI>generally</HI> is likewi&s;e u&s;ed, namely, <Q>take them fir&s;t and la&s;t, and they generally do more Hurt than Good.</Q></P>
<P>It would be contrary to common Sen&s;e, to ap|ply that Character of <HI>Letter-learned</HI> to all, for &s;ome are ignorant. Or that of <HI>plai&s;ter'd Hypocrites</HI> to all,
<PB N="78" REF="005297_0078_1016F6094A025CD8">
for &s;ome declare their Sin as <HI>Sodom,</HI> and refu&s;ed to be a&s;hamed. Or that of <HI>fal&s;e Apo&s;tles, deceitful Workers,</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of Satan to all, I have apply'd that Scripture, which contain the&s;e Epithets only to &s;uch of them, as ri&s;e up in Arms again&s;t the Life of Piety, when it comes near their Borders, and con|&s;ult, combine, and contrive again&s;t it in their Con|claves, as a common Enemy; and who with Art, Rhetorick, and Appearances of Piety, varni&s;h their Oppo&s;ition again&s;t the Kingdom of CHRIST; and who imitate the Apo&s;tles of CHRIST, as the Magicians did the Works of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Neither are the&s;e following Characters univer&s;al in re&s;pect of the ungodly Mini&s;try. Namely, the <HI>Craft</HI> of <HI>Foxes</HI> and <HI>cruelty</HI> of <HI>Wolves,</HI> for &s;ome of them are doubtle&s;s as weak as their Neighbours, tho' di|vers of them it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed are wi&s;er in their Generation, than the Children of Light; and &s;ome are good temper'd, and are not rou&s;ed to Arms by the near Approach of vital Religion. Nor are the&s;e Words following, to be apply'd univer&s;ally to every gracele&s;s Mini&s;ter, namely, <Q>that they would not let a faithful Man come into the Mini&s;try, if they cou'd help it!</Q> No its chiefly tho&s;e of them that have their natural Enmity rous'd, and whetted, by the &s;earching nearne&s;s of Gods Work to them, as well by the faithful Dealings, and holy Living of godly Mini&s;ters, by which they are detected and condemn'd; that are &s;o cautious to keep pious Men out of the Mini&s;try, upon &s;elfi&s;h Accounts, namely, to pre|vent a Trouble to them&s;elves, and the Lo&s;s of their Credit among the People.</P>
<P>But as to the re&s;t of the Characters, which our <HI>Examiner</HI>'s Friends, have with &s;o much Care collect|ed, they belong to all unconverted Mini&s;ters, ei|ther ab&s;olutely, or comparatively, properly or figura|tively, and for the Proof of this, I appeal to the Scriptures and common Sen&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="005297_0079_1016F60AD3E24948">I might add to what I have &s;aid, were it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that divers of the Epithets and Cen&s;ures charg|ed upon unconverted Mini&s;ters, in the <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon are borrow'd, from the Writings of <HI>Calvini&s;ti|cal</HI> Divines, famous for their Learning and Piety, &s;uch as Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Hilder&s;ham, Pool, Burge&s;s, Baxter, Brackle, Fenner</HI> Be&s;ides what are expre&s;sly &s;criptu|ral, &s;o that the Cen&s;ure the <HI>Queri&s;t</HI>'s labours to ca&s;t upon me, rather falls directly upon tho&s;e Worthies of the Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>Indeed I have heard People, of Piety and good Sen&s;e ob&s;erve, upon this <HI>Popular Paragraph,</HI> that the Gentlemen who had put it together, in its pre&s;ent Form, had taken a pretty deal of Pains, to draw their own Picture: But whether the main <HI>Strokes,</HI> of this unhand&s;ome Draft, do exactly &s;uit tho&s;e Men, I will not at pre&s;ent determine, but leave to their farther Enquiry's. But in the mean Time, I would ask them, whether a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Guilt, made them apply to them&s;elves in particular, what I only &s;poke in general, without Application to any, Their Words are the&s;e <HI>murderous Hypocrites,</HI> that are to take Care, lea&s;t <HI>we</HI> feel the Force of a Halter &amp;c. If they find them&s;elves guilty, they &s;houdn't take &s;uch Characters ill, but humble them&s;elves before God, for their Wickedne&s;s in <HI>murdering</HI> the <HI>Convicti|ons</HI> of poor Sinners, and repent! A</P>
<P N="5">5th. In&s;tance of unfair Dealing, under the afore|&s;aid Charge, is this, that while they are pretending to give an Account of my Repre&s;entation, of the Characters of unconverted Mini&s;ters, they <HI>&s;lyly</HI> and <HI>&s;ophi&s;tically</HI> bring in their Hearers. The Words they cite are the&s;e, <Q>Who&s;e Hearers are as blind as Moles, and as dead as Stones.</Q> What then are the People that hear the ungodly Clergy, Mi|ni&s;ters too? O &s;trange! by bringing in this broken Scrap of a Sentence of my Sermon; they would &s;eem to in&s;inuate, that it is my Opinion, that all the &s;tated Hearers of unconverted Mini&s;ters, are blind as Moles and dead as Stones, which is fal&s;e.
<PB N="80" REF="005297_0080_1016F60F876543C8">
In that Paragraph, from whence this Scrap is taken, I there explain my &s;elf, that it is &s;uch who content them&s;elves, with a cold, carele&s;s, general unawak|ening Mini&s;try; who are blind, &amp;c. One may per|ceive without the help of Spectacles, that their Po|litick De&s;ign, in bringing the afore&s;aid <HI>Scrap</HI> Head and Shoulders, was to alarm the angry Re&s;entments of the People again&s;t me, and my Rev. Brethren thro' me who are cordial in God's Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve in the mean Time, that I think it &s;omewhat odd, that tho&s;e dear Brethren of the <HI>Examiner,</HI> &s;hould have left out one import|ant Branch, of the Characters of many gracele&s;s Mini&s;ters, which is mentioned <HI>pag.</HI> 6. of the <HI>Not|ingham</HI> Sermon in the&s;e Words. <Q>It may be far|ther ob&s;erved that the Phari&s;ee Teachers in CHRIST'S Time, were great Biggots to &s;mall Matters in Religion, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23 23. <HI>Woe unto you, Scribes, and Phari&s;ees, Hypocrites, for ye pay Tyth of Mint, Annis, and Cummin, and have omitted the weigh|tier Matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith?</HI></Q> Was it, becau&s;e it plainly di&s;covers the Vanity of their <HI>thread bare cant</HI> and cry, about <HI>Order, Order, Order;</HI> while they are labouring with both Hands, to tear down Gods Work and Servants. If &s;o, they are more cautious, than candid.</P>
<P>Another particular, that I would ju&s;t mention here, is the altering of the Word <HI>faithful-Man</HI> to <HI>Ho|ne&s;t-Man.</HI> If this Gentleman or his Friends have done this of Purpo&s;e, it is very ba&s;e. The Pa&s;&s;age I referr'd to, is <HI>pag.</HI> 17 of the <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon, where it is &s;aid, in the fir&s;t Edition, <Q>That if they cou'd help it, they woudn't let a faithful Man come into the Mini&s;try.</Q> But in the <HI>Examiner</HI>'s Performance, I find the Words are, <HI>Hone&s;t Man,</HI> which a Per&s;on may be, and yet intirely grace|le&s;s.</P>

under this third In&s;tance, yet I believe, it will be difficult, to vindicate our Author from what he charges upon me therein, which is Uncha|ritablene&s;s <HI>e. g.</HI> is it not uncharitable in our Au|thor? When he has no &s;ufficient Foundation from my Words related by him, to charge me with the Evils before mentioned? Do&s;n't this look like an a&s;&s;uming of the incommunicable Prerogative of God, who alone is <HI>Kerdiogno&s;tos.</HI> For him to judge as afore&s;aid, without any Foundation from my Words, yea contrary to them; (as appears from the Preface to the <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon where I &s;olemnly declare the Rea&s;on, why I us'd &s;uch Acrimony) isn't this ra&s;h judging with a Witne&s;s, and doth it not &s;a|vour of Uncharitablene&s;s? Alas! How cou'd our Author print this, after printing an Account of his Charity, in the fir&s;t <HI>pag.</HI> of his Performance?</P>
<P>Is it not likewi&s;e uncharitable in our Author, to appear &s;o much in Defence of ungodly Mini&s;ters, many of whom, do &s;o much harm to the Church of God. Why is the <HI>Apple</HI> of his <HI>Eye</HI> touch'd? And why does he <HI>&s;igh</HI> &s;o heavily <HI>alas,</HI> when they are painted in their own Colours?</P>
<P>I may add, doesn't it &s;eem as if the <HI>Examiner</HI> him&s;elf judg'd the Body of the Mini&s;try of this Ge|neration, to be unconverted?

<P>As to what is mention'd in the Margin <Q>about &s;ome Rev. Gentleman's putting me to &s;ilence, by ob&s;erving that he had heard me twice or thrice,
<PB N="82" REF="005297_0082_1016F613CAB1B778">
but found that he had got &s;uch a &s;hort String of Prayer by heart, that he could almo&s;t repeat it verbatim.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It is fal&s;e, I know nothing of it, tho&s;e that are us'd to hear me frequently, can witne&s;s that I am far from u&s;ing the &s;ame Words often, unle&s;s it be the LORDS Prayer that the Objector means, that indeed I u&s;e frequently. Perhaps the <HI>Examiner</HI> and his Friends take this in <HI>Dudgeon,</HI> if they do, I can't help it, for my Part I think it is a very laudable Practice, I don't know what better Order or Words we can u&s;e in Acts of Religious Wor&s;hip, than tho&s;e our Lord has taught us?</P>
<P>But that which I &s;poke again&s;t, was the long Strings of lifele&s;s, &s;aple&s;s, &s;piritle&s;s formal, Prayer, which &s;ome are generally guilty of, who tire their Audience with their long and dead Acts of Devotion, &amp; who &s;eem not to &s;trive after the Breathings of the Spirit; but whatever the Frame of their Souls be, their Words are much the &s;ame, and their Prayers of an equal Length. I have had credible Informa|tion of a Mini&s;ter in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> now a no better Friend of God's Work, than our Author; who about 17 or 18 Years agone was then a Candidate for the Mi|ni&s;try, and fam'd among &s;ome, for the Neatne&s;s and Elegancy of his Prayers; who&s;e Prayers were ge|nerally an Hour long, and in many Times upon Tryal by the Watch did not vary &s;carce a Minute under or over. Perhaps our Author will &s;ay, that this is orderly, I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent di&s;pute the Point with him, but only ob&s;erve, that &s;uch Ex|actne&s;s in this Particular, does not &s;uit me, I do not care to be &s;o &s;trait laced.

<P N="4">4th In&s;tance of &s;uppo&s;ed Contradiction, contain'd in his 14, 15, and 16. <HI>pages,</HI> which is cited from <HI>pag.</HI> 48 of my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon thus, <Q>And here I mu&s;t take leave to ob&s;erve, that the Practice of &s;taying at home, rather than their going to hear &s;uch Mini&s;ters, (&s;ound in Principle and regular in Practice) as are judged by &s;ome to be unconvert|ed,
<PB N="83" REF="005297_0083_1016F6168E742260">
is un&s;criptural and of dangerous Tendency, in my Opinion; for it hangs the whole Weight of the publick Wor&s;hip of God upon the un|certain Judgment of Men, tho' unconverted Mi|ni&s;ters are not likely to do &s;o much Good, as o|thers, yet &s;eeing that many of them doubtle&s;s do preach the &s;ame Word of God, which others do, why may not the Soverign God who permits them by his Providence to come into the Mi|ni&s;try, ble&s;s the Word deliver'd by them for the Good of Mankind?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Be&s;ides, the afore&s;aid Practice of &s;taying at Home, &amp;c. opens a Door to Delu&s;ion by fal&s;e Teachers, as well as to Confu&s;ion and Schi&s;m in the Church of God.</Q></P>

Look into the Congregations of unconverted Mini&s;ters, and &s;ee what a &s;ad Security reigns there, not a Soul convinced that can be heard of for many Years together! What if &s;ome In&s;tances could be &s;hewn, of unconverted Mini&s;ters, being in|&s;trumental in convincing Per&s;ons of their lo&s;t State, the Thing is very rare and extraordinary, and for what I know, as many In&s;tances might be given of Satans convincing Per&s;ons by his Temptations, it is a kind of Chance Medly be|tween the Father and his Children, when any &s;uch Event happens.

He of Purpo&s;e leaves out &s;uch Sentences, as &s;erve to explain my Meaning, and &s;hew a Harmony in my Writings <HI>e. g.</HI> what our Author cites, from the 49 <HI>pag.</HI> of my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon, is but a little Piece of a Sentence, broken off from a large Para|graph, more than two Thirds whereof are left out. The whole Paragraph runs thus <Q>I mu&s;t declare
<PB N="85" REF="005297_0085_1016F61D42FD0B90">
to the World, that I dread the Tho'ts of Schi&s;ms and Separations in the Church of God <HI>(this was all our Author cited, now the Words immediately following are,)</HI> becau&s;e of the di&s;mal Handle, that is thereby given to Seducers, to promote their erronious Tenets; as al&s;o becau&s;e of the Di&s;honour that is hereby ca&s;t upon God's Name, Ways, and People. Hereby wicked Men are &s;trengthned in their Prujudices again&s;t Religion; hereby Profe&s;&s;ors are diverted from promoting Gods Work to per&s;onal Controver&s;ies of no Moment. therefore when the Ca&s;e &s;o happens, that People are di&s;atisfied with their Mini&s;ter, and can't get Edification by his Mini&s;trations, after long and impartial Labours. To this End it &s;eems mo&s;t ad|vi&s;able for them, humbly and peaceably (in a re|gular Manner) to &s;eek to get an A&s;&s;i&s;tant with him, if the Place be able to &s;upport two; but if not, to ask Leave of their Pa&s;tor, and other Church Officers, to go where they are more edifyed; in the mean Time laying a&s;ide all ra&s;h Cen&s;ures. And &s;hould not Mini&s;ters al&s;o for Peace &s;ake de|ny them&s;elves, and con&s;ent to the rea&s;onable Pro|po&s;als of their People? waving all exa&s;perating Reflections upon their di&s;atisfy'd People, and more e&s;pecially in their publick Performances. O! may the God of Peace incline us to &s;tudy, and pur&s;ue the Things that are for Peace.</Q> Now I leave it to the Reader to judge if the remaining Part of the afore&s;aid Paragraph, does not fully explain my Meaning, and &s;hew a harmony in my Writings, and whether it was not unju&s;t in our Author to leave in out? And,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. As to the In&s;tance taken out of the <HI>Noting|ham</HI> Sermon; our Author deals unfairly al&s;o, the fir&s;t Words he mentions, namely the&s;e, <Q>Is a dead Man fit to bring others to Life?</Q> is a Sentence taken out of the Middle of a large Paragraph, which you may find chiefly in the 11 <HI>pag.</HI> the re&s;t of which is wholly omitted. To the afore&s;aid Sen|tence,
<PB N="86" REF="005297_0086_1016F620526770E8">
our Author joyns &s;ix Lines taken out of the beginning of another Paragraph in the 12 <HI>pag.</HI> without giving the lea&s;t Notice of this to the Rea|der, and leaves out all the Re&s;t, of a large Para|graph, and then adds another Paragraph in the 31&s;t <HI>pag.</HI> (of the fir&s;t Edition) and there takes a little and leaves the re&s;t. What Writings can &s;tand before &s;uch partial Proceeding? But</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Another unju&s;t Method of our Author is this, in order to oppo&s;e the Declaration I have made in the 43d <HI>pag.</HI> of my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon, namely of my <Q>dreading the tho'ts of Shi&s;ms, and Separation in the Church of God.</Q> He do&s;n't bring my Words only, which he ought to have done, but refers to, and cites the Words of my Enemies; who oppo&s;e the Work of God in this Part of the Country: What, does their differing from me &s;hew a Difference be|tween me and my&s;elf? which our Author was to prove. Are then they my&s;elf? if &s;o, our Author has proved his Point, otherwi&s;e not. Alas! what &s;orry &s;huffling is here? The Examiner &s;eems to be aware of this, and therefore he does not put their Words in the oppo&s;ite Collumn to mine, which would be too bare Fac'd and too ea&s;ily di&s;covered; but &s;ets an <HI>A&s;teri&s;m</HI> there, referring to them, and gives his reader a Hint to &s;ee the note at the <HI>A&s;te|ri&s;m;</HI> and thus he leaves a Blank in the Column, and cites their Words in the Margin. What &s;neaking petty Sophi&s;try is this? It would not only have look'd better to have &s;et them in the Collumn, but have &s;hewn a little more Hone&s;ty in our Au|thor. But enough of this.</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to what this Gentleman cites, from the Writings of my Opponents, in contradiction to another Declaration of mine, before related, (which is mention'd in my Remarks, on their Prote&s;t; which Declaration, harmonizes with that in the <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon.) I &s;hall only &s;ay at Pre&s;ent, that I affirmed nothing therein but the very Truth; however &s;trange they may pretend it is to them.

And that I hope the Almighty will always give me Boldne&s;s to expre&s;s, whoever oppo&s;e it, either to gratify their Spleen, or guard their Credit and worldly Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Neither does the <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon oppo&s;e the Declaration afore&s;aid, for it only a&s;&s;erts a <HI>regular withdrawing,</HI> from the &s;tated hearing of one Mini&s;ter to another (in ordinary Ca&s;es) for greater Edifica|tion, in the General, without particular Applica|tion to any. The <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon as to the Sub&s;tance of it, upon that Head they refer to (and others al&s;o) I had wrote as my Opinion and preach'd, a matter of ten Years before I ever was at <HI>Notingham.</HI></P>
<P>I am not accountable for any Sen&s;e that Per&s;ons may put upon my Words, for which they have no Foundation in them. The Sermon gave no more Encouragement to leave their Mini&s;try than my own, on Condition it was as it &s;hould be, and if it was not how could I help that? It is true in|deed, divers Per&s;ons after they were awakned, de|clared that they could not find any <HI>Reli&s;h</HI> under the Mini&s;try of &s;ome of their Number, nor get any Benefit by it, and were therefore di&s;pos'd to go el&s;e where, where they did get Good to all Appearance. And that which &s;trengthned the A|ver&s;ion of many godly Per&s;ons to their Mini&s;tra|tions, was their &s;lighting of Gods Work, together with the In&s;truments <HI>Jehovah</HI> was pleas'd to u&s;e in promoting of it. And here give me Leave to propo&s;e this Querie to Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> and his A&s;ociates, whether it was becau&s;e that &s;uch as were convinc'd of Sin, had generally a le&s;s E&s;teem of his Mini&s;tra|tions, and of &s;ome of the re&s;t of his Party, that he and &s;ome (at lea&s;t) of them, have &s;o fiercely oppos'd the ble&s;&s;ed Opperations of the Holy Gho&s;t, in a|larming and convincing a &s;ecure World of Sin, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Judgment? If &s;o is not it &s;elfi&s;h and &s;ordid with a Witne&s;s, and a blow at the Root of Piety? For my own Part I mu&s;t &s;ay, That I

humbly conceive that to be the Secret of the Story of their Oppo&s;ition, the Bottom of the Mi&s;tery, the true Spring of their Malignant contending a|gain&s;t vital Godline&s;s, the Fal&s;e and ungenerous Me|thods, as well as long Continuance of their Oppo|&s;ition to the Work of God, under &s;o much Ad|vantage of Light and Evidence in favour of it, together with their dangerous Errors before men|tioned, frees me from the ju&s;t Imputation of Ra&s;h judging in thinking, as I have expre&s;&s;'d.</P>
<P>As to what they &s;ay of, <Q>our Adherents &s;etting up &s;eparate Meetings at <HI>Nothingham</HI> and many o|ther Places, in complyance with &s;aid Sermon, and others of the &s;ame Kind.</Q> This is Fal&s;e; there is not a Word in that Sermon that encoura|ges &s;eparate Meetings from any Mini&s;try, merely becau&s;e they are unconverted. No, the very con|trary is expre&s;s'd <HI>pag.</HI> 15. in the&s;e Words. <Q>Dear Sirs, we &s;hould mo&s;t earne&s;tly pray for them, that the Compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour may pre&s;erve them by his Mighty Power thro' Faith unto Salvation, &s;upport their &s;inking Spirits under the melan|choly Unea&s;ine&s;s of a dead Mini&s;try, &s;anctify and &s;weeten to them, the dry Mor&s;els they get under &s;uch blind Men, when they have none better to repair to.</Q> No, it was their bitter Oppo&s;ition to the Power of Religion, that gave Ri&s;e to &s;eparate Meetings, together with their irregular and unju&s;t attempt, to ca&s;t us out of <HI>Synodical</HI> Communion; neither have I or any of my Brethren that I know of, ever preach'd any Sermon of that kind they Mention.</P>
<P>Their affirming that the whole Country knows, that it is (meaning my Declaration afore&s;aid) a no|torious Fal&s;ehood: And that I have encourag'd People from the Pulpit and Pre&s;s, to for&s;ake their Mini&s;try, is a dreadfull In&s;tance of <HI>effronted Impiety.</HI> O &s;hame! What &s;ort of Men are the&s;e? Who not only a&s;&s;ert an egregious Fal&s;ehood, but ap|peal to the whole Country to prove it. To confront

their Charge, I do appeal to the numerous Multi|tudes, where ever I have preach'd the Go&s;pel of CHRIST, if what they have alledged be not a groundle&s;s and crim&s;on Calumny, which tho&s;e E|nemies of the Power of Religion, do impute to me? It is the Nece&s;&s;ity of their wretched Cau&s;e, that ur|ges tho&s;e unhappy Men, to take &s;uch &s;inful and &s;candalous Methods, in order to cloak their Hor|rible Wickedne&s;s, <HI>in oppo&s;ing Gods Work,</HI> which has been the real Cau&s;e of the Divi&s;ions &s;ub&s;i&s;ting a|mong us; which they without Foundation a&s;cribe to me.</P>
<P>Neither does what I have &s;aid, <HI>pag.</HI> 29. of my Remarks, on their <HI>Prote&s;t,</HI> contradict what I have now alledged. The Words are the&s;e <Q>No doubt there is a Relation, between a Pa&s;tor and his People, but the De&s;ign of this being to promote their Good, we think it unrea&s;onable, that it &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t to the Prejudice of that which it's de|&s;ign'd to procure, however in ordinary Ca&s;es, we think it to be the Peoples Duty, to make regular Application to their Pa&s;tors to go where they get the greate&s;t Benefit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But when Mini&s;ters con&s;pire to oppo&s;e, the Work and faithful Servants of God, in the mo&s;t open and flagrant Manner, we &s;ee no Harm in this Ca&s;e, in u&s;ing an extraordinary Method.</Q></P>
<P>Here ob&s;erve; that the afore&s;aid Remarks, were compos'd and publi&s;h'd after Things were brought to the utmo&s;t cri&s;is and Confu&s;ion among us; by their &s;trange and unaccountable Conduct: And af|ter a Rupture was forc'd between them and us, by their Prote&s;t; and therefore nothing I have &s;aid therein cou'd po&s;&s;ibly be even the Occa&s;ion of either.</P>
<P>As to that of extraordinary Ca&s;es, I have &s;poken to it before, and therefore &s;hall not now add, ex|cepting this, that if Mini&s;ters con&s;piring to oppo&s;e the Work and Servants of God, as afore&s;aid,&mdash;be not an <HI>extraordinary Ca&s;e,</HI> I know not what is,</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="005297_0090_1016F62AC5B24468">But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion, to the 4th In|&s;tance of &s;uppo&s;ed Contradiction, in my Sermons, which I was di&s;cour&s;ing upon: I &s;hall ju&s;t take leave to add, to what has been already ob&s;erved, the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> particulars following, namely.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Occa&s;ions upon which they were written, were different. The Pa&s;&s;ages referr'd to in the <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon were occa&s;ioned by reports of a &s;eparating Di&s;po&s;ition obtaining in <HI>New-England:</HI> I was inform'd that &s;ome were &s;eparating from the Mini&s;try of &s;uch as were &s;ound in Principle, regular in Life, and approvers of God's Work; and that &s;ome &s;tay'd at Home, rather than they would hear &s;uch, <HI>meerly</HI> becau&s;e they judg'd them unconverted! This di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me in Mind much&punc; and to this Ca&s;e the fore-cited Paragraphs, in the 48 and 49 pages of my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon, directly refer.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon was occa&s;ioned by the View I had of the Danger of unconverted Mini&s;ters in general, and the Mi&s;chief that I was credibly in|form'd, &s;ome of them had done to the Souls of Men in particular, <HI>e&s;pecially of late!</HI></P>
<P>Again, let it further be ob&s;erved, that in both tho&s;e Sermons, I acknowledge the&s;e Things following.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That unconverted Mini&s;ters <HI>might</HI> be in&s;tru|mental in doing Good. And</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That they &s;hould be heard, when we have no better. See <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon, page 15.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. I a&s;&s;ert in both, That we &s;hould not leave their Mini&s;try in ordinary Ca&s;es, without regular Application.</P>
<P>Therefore the only appearance of Contradiction is this, that in the <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon I &s;eem'd to &s;peak more favourably of unconverted Mini&s;ters doing Good; then in the In&s;tances our Author alledges or cites from the <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon.</P>
<P>But to remove this apparent Difficulty, let it be con&s;idered, that it is only of &s;uch of them as <HI>preach &s;ound Doctrine,</HI> are <HI>regular in Life,</HI> and <HI>favour God's Work,</HI> that I have &s;poken &s;o mildly of in the Mora|vian
<PB N="91" REF="005297_0091_1016F62FD929B620">
Sermon, and not of all. And that in the Not|tingham Sermon, in the Pages referred to by our Author, there are exceptions admitted, as may ap|pear by the&s;e Words. "p. 11. the Mini&s;try of natural Men is for the mo&s;t Part unprofitable, and <HI>pag.</HI> 31. <Q>for take them fir&s;t and la&s;t, and they generally do more hurt than Good.</Q></P>
<P>It is certain that unconverted Mini&s;ters are of different Sorts. For,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Some of them are un&s;ound in Fundamen|tals, the&s;e every one mu&s;t acknowledge, are not like|ly do do good, but much hurt.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Some are Prophane in Practice, the&s;e are not likely to do Good, but Hurt.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Some are malignant Oppo&s;ers of God's Work, the&s;e are not likely to do good but much Hurt,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Some are quite Secure, unacquainted with Conviction, and the Similiar Workings of the Spirit of God, now there is no Probability that &s;uch will do Good, in re&s;pect of the Conviction and Conver&s;ion of Sinners, tho' they may be means of In&s;tructing Per|&s;ons in the Knowledge of &s;ome doctrinal Points of Religion, which is doubtle&s;s Good in its Place and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Some are under Conviction, and the Similiar Workings of the Spirit, &s;ound in Doctrine, and favourers of God's Work. There is indeed <HI>&s;ome</HI> Probability, that &s;uch will be means of awaking and converting Sinners.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides it may be farther ob&s;erv'd, that when in the Nottingham Sermon I have &s;poke diminitively of the u&s;efulne&s;s of unconverted Mini&s;ters, it was chiefly in re&s;pect of <HI>Conviction</HI> and <HI>Conver&s;ion. See p.</HI> 13.</P>
<P>Now altho' what I have offer'd does fully remove the Appearance of Contradiction, objected by our Author; yet becau&s;e one of the Pa&s;&s;ages he cites, from the 13th. p. of the <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon about <HI>Satans Temptations,</HI> and <HI>Chance Medly,</HI> as before related, has been frequently us'd and much triumph'd in by oppo&s;ers this Way, I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="92" REF="005297_0092_1016F6315EF0F988">
to &s;ignify my meaning, more fully in tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;i|ons. And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t I do not, nor never did intend by the&s;e Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, to put the <HI>Temptations of Satan</HI> in re&s;pect of Tendency, to convince, upon a par with the Preach|ing of an unconverted Mini&s;ter, when he preaches &s;ound Doctrine, according to the Scriptures; No! God forbid, I abhor the thought! But</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Particulars therefore, that I there in|&s;i&s;t upon, are the&s;e namely, that the In&s;tances of Conviction, by the Mini&s;try of unconverted Men, are (for the General) very rare and Extraordinary, and &s;o they are as appears from what has been &s;aid before. And 2dly I do not po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert, that as many are convinced by <HI>Satans Temptations,</HI> as by the preaching of unconverted Mini&s;ters, I only &s;ay for what I know the Number may be equal. I have met with &s;ome my&s;elf, that have been awakned, by the <HI>Temptations</HI> of the Enemy; which gave me &s;ome Room to &s;ay, what I have &s;aid. But whither the Number be equal I will not a&s;&s;ert, however I may &s;afely &s;ay, that I don't know cer|tainly but it may; if others do, let them declare it and prove their A&s;&s;ertion if they can, but as for my&s;elf, I mu&s;t profe&s;s Ignorance in this Point. And,</P>
<P N="3">3dly. As to that of <HI>chance medly,</HI> between the Father and his Children, I mean no more but this, viz. <Q>That when Per&s;ons happen to be con|vinced by <HI>Satan's Temptations,</HI> he do&s;n't intend it; and that it is &s;o al&s;o, with many unconverted Mini&s;ters.</Q></P>
<P>For Illu&s;trations &s;ake, I &s;hall beg leave to tell a Story or two. I remember to have heard of a gracele&s;s Mini&s;ter, that was once preaching in <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> and it happned that a Gentlewomans Maid was convinc'd by his Sermon, (who under&s;tood as little of the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of Conviction as the Mini&s;ter) and therefore &s;he came to the Mini&s;ter, and told him in a frett, <HI>that he had &s;poil'd her Maid by his preaching, for the Maid was &s;o di&s;tre&s;s'd that &s;he
<PB N="93" REF="005297_0093_1016F632E647C630">
coud'nt work.</HI> He told her, <Q><HI>that</HI> he was very &s;orry for it, and that he intended no &s;uch Thing.</Q> Now Sir, was not this <HI>chance medly?</HI> The good na|tur'd Mini&s;ter intended no Harm to the Girle, (as he recon'd it) but it fell out &s;omething un|luckily to him, poor Man!</P>
<P>Another &s;uch In&s;tance, as I have been credibly inform'd, has hapend lately in Holand. A certain Mini&s;ter not long &s;ince, was rai&s;ing again&s;t &s;ome pious Mini&s;ters in the Neighbourhood; becau&s;e they brought People into di&s;tre&s;s by their Preaching: And in the mean Time, one came and told him, <Q>That a particular Per&s;on was brought into di&s;tre&s;s by his preaching,</Q> which &s;urpriz'd him, (as well it might) and &s;oon &s;top'd his Mouth, poor Gen|tleman! How could he help it? For Accidents will &s;ometimes happen, whatever care be taken to prevent them.</P>
<P>I might come nearer home, and tell you a &s;hort Story, that has happened not long agone, in this part of the Country, as I have been inform'd by divers Per&s;ons; which take as follows, A certain Preacher took up one of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Sermons, and read it in a Family where he was well ac|quainted, (the Heads of which had a con&s;iderable Re&s;pect for him) by reading the Sermon afore&s;aid, the Man and Woman were convinced; who had afterwards le&s;s regard for him, when their Minds were enlightened then before, the Preacher came afterwards to the Hou&s;e, and expre&s;s'd his unea&s;i|ne&s;s at what had happened, as to their being brought under Trouble by the Sermon.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad that Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> for his own &s;ake, as well as on the Account of the poor Souls, he deludes with his fal&s;e and dangerous Doctrine about <HI>Conviction</HI> before related, might meet with &s;ome &s;uch In&s;tances of <HI>chance-medly</HI> in his Mini&s;tra|tions. Perhaps it might &s;top his Mouth, and check his Pen, from uttering &s;uch &s;ophi&s;tical and unju&s;t re|flections,
<PB N="94" REF="005297_0094_1016F6359E8CE858">
again&s;t the Convincing Operations of God's holy Spirit. I proceed to the,</P>
<P N="5">5th, In&s;tance of &s;uppos'd contradiction, which is as follows, <Q><HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon, p. 53 in order to pre&s;erve our &s;elves, and our Po&s;terity, from the Infection of Error, I think it is needful to u&s;e (in our proper Spheres) all &s;uitable Means, to obtain a godly learned and regular Mini&s;try; when ignorant Novices are admitted into the Mini&s;te|rial order, they are apt to be puff'd up to the Churches great Prejudice, as well as their own, and to &s;pread Error when they know it not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To &s;ay that the&s;e Qualifications may be or|dinarily attain'd, without human Learning is notoriou&s;ly Enthu&s;ia&s;tical, and Fooli&s;h. In &s;hort human learning is nece&s;&s;ary, or there mu&s;t be In&s;piration to &s;upply the want thereof.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;uppos'd oppo&s;ite, is drawn from the 11 p. of the <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon; which runs thus, viz. <Q>The mo&s;t likely Method to &s;tock the Church, with a faithful Mini&s;try, <HI>(not learned)</HI> in the pre|&s;ent Situation of Things, the publick Academy's being &s;o much corrupted and abus'd generally, is to encourage private Schools, or Seminarys of learning, which are under the Care of skilful and experienced Chri&s;tians, in which tho&s;e only &s;hould be admitted, who upon &s;trict Examination, have in the Judgment of a rea&s;onable Charity, the plain Evidences of experimental Religion. This Method has in my Opinion a noble Tendency, to build up the Church of God, don't think it much if the Phari&s;ees be offended at &s;uch a pro|po&s;al, &amp;c.</Q> To what has been mentioned, the <HI>Examiner</HI> anexes &s;ome Lines of a Writing of the Oppo&s;ers in <HI>Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> which runs thus,</P>
<P><Q>Some of Mr. <HI>Tennents</HI> very good Friends have confe&s;&s;ed, that this Propo&s;al has a friendly a&s;pect on his Fathers <HI>Log-Hou&s;e:</HI> But it's generally tho't, if that &s;hould be built upon the ruin of our pub|lick Academy's, neither Religion nor learning

<P>Here it will be only nece&s;&s;ary to remove, what our Author has added, and to add what he has left our, and then the Contradiction evani&s;hes. And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The <HI>Examiner</HI> adds to what he cites from the <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon the&s;e Words of his own, in a Parenthe&s;is, in <HI>Italick</HI> Characters, namely <HI>(not learned)</HI> &s;o that the Sentence runs thus, <HI>viz.</HI> The mo&s;t likely "Method to Stock the Church, with a faithful, "(nor learned Mini&s;try) here indeed if the Parenthe|&s;is is included, as our Author doubtle&s;s de&s;igned, by in&s;erting of it, it is a real Contradiction, for faith|fullne&s;s is oppos'd to learning, but it is entirely of our Authors making: if he Thinks that Faithful|ne&s;s and Learning cannot con&s;i&s;t together, I pity him, but beg to be excus'd from concuring in &s;o dete&s;ta|ble a Notion. No Conjunction is more amiable in its &s;elf, and u&s;eful to the Church of God, then of tho&s;e habits or Qualities, which our Author labours to &s;et at an unfriendly Di&s;tance.</P>

The <HI>Examiner</HI> leaves out the following Sentence, viz. <Q>Pious and experienced Youths, who have a good natural capacity, and great de|&s;ires, after the Mini&s;terial Work from good Mo|tives, might be &s;ought for, and found up and down the Country; and put to private Schools of the Prophets, e&s;pecially in &s;uch Places where the Publick, ones are not.</Q> Here let the Rea|der ob&s;erve, that what our Author cited, was immediately before and after this Sentence, and yet it was left out, which mu&s;t be of Purpo&s;e; what unju&s;t Treatment is this? And yet the <HI>Examiner</HI> pro|fe&s;&s;es <HI>Charity,</HI> and now let the Reader judge, if we don't need the Collums again, after this Union of the Poles.</P>
<P>As to what our Author borrows from the oppo|&s;ers, this way. I think it only needful to &s;ay, briefly as follows, viz. What it the Propo&s;al had a favourable A&s;pect upon the <HI>Log-Hou&s;e,</HI> where is the
<PB N="96" REF="005297_0096_1016F63C926C00E0">
Harm of it? Mayn't Per&s;ons be taught as well in a <HI>Log-Hou&s;e</HI> as in a <HI>Stone</HI> or <HI>Brick-Hou&s;e?</HI> in the mean Time every Eye may &s;ee, that the Propo|&s;al re&s;pects not one Hou&s;e more than another, where both Piety and Learning are regarded. The In&s;inuation of building the <HI>Log Hou&s;e</HI> upon the ruin of publick Academys, is Invidious and without Foun|dation, as appears from what has been already menti|oned; the Di&s;tance between this private School and any publick Academys, is &s;o great that their is no danger of its interferring with them.</P>
<P>Whatever contempt the&s;e Men, from whom our Author borrows the afore&s;aid Pa&s;&s;age, are pleas'd to ca&s;t upon the School, under my honoured Fa|thers Tuition; yet Multitudes of Pious People in this Land can witne&s;s, that divers who have come out of it, have been eminently &s;ucce&s;sful in propo|gating the truly noble Intere&s;ts of vital Chri&s;tia|nity; as the De&s;ign of its In&s;truction, was to in|troduce more faithful Mini&s;ters into the Church, that thereby experimental and pactical Religion, might, together with human learning, be promo|ted, &s;o it has pleas'd a gracious God, (adored be his Name) to crown with au&s;picious Smiles, the humble E&s;&s;ays, that have been made to &s;erve his Glory and his Church. The,</P>
<P N="6">6th, In&s;tance comes now to be con&s;idered, (p. 17) which is taken from <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon p. 62. <Q>For any Men to pretend to know certainly, who are gracious, as one of the <HI>Moravian</HI>'s did in my hear|ing, is to a&s;&s;ume an incommunicable Prerogative of God, and to run upon this Plan in Church Matters, is to turn all into the wilde&s;t Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;uppos'd oppo&s;ite to what has been mentioned is this, <Q>The <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> pertinently ob&s;erve, p. 10. part 3. That the Scope of the whole Sermon at <HI>Notingham,</HI> &s;eems to imply that Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> would have Men to believe, that they may know a converted from an unconverted Mini|&s;ter,
<PB N="97" REF="005297_0097_1016F63F9CDB4C70">
or el&s;e would not the main Part of the Fabrick fall?</Q></P>
<P>Here let the Reader ob&s;erve how our charitable Author deals with me again, <HI>viz.</HI> in&s;tead of my Words he &s;ets the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> Words in one of the Collums, <HI>viz.</HI> Their Judgment of the Scope of the <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon, that Men may know, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I an&s;wer, well what then, &s;o they may know fallibly and probably a converted from an unconverted Mini&s;ter, and thus the Fabrick of the Sermon is &s;upported, without any unfriendly Oppo&s;ition to the other Column; except our Author makes fallible and infallible Knowledge to be the &s;ame, which will prove a herculian Labour.</P>
<P>But the Examiner proceeds to &s;ay thus, <Q>The <HI>Moravians</HI> &s;peak out what is more artfully conceal'd by Mr. <HI>Tennent,</HI> under the Gui&s;e of a near Gue&s;s, a probable Knowledge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Mens State to|wards God, by an Examination of Mens Prin|ciples, Experience, and Practice. Who made thee a Judge of Mens inward Experiences and &s;e|cret State.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Well, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Examiner,</HI> you are realy in a fair Way to commence <HI>Moravian,</HI> if you are not one already. The <HI>Moravians</HI> &s;peak out, what I artfully conceal you &s;ay, &s;o, &s;o, they are then in your O|pinion candid and open, but I re&s;erv'd and Hypocriti|cal; well, I &s;ee you are &s;till as charitable to me as you was, ju&s;t when you put on the Cloak, in the beginning of your worthy Performance. I &s;ee you are no Changeling in re&s;pect of your &s;ort of Charity! I am oblig'd to you Mr. <HI>Examiner,</HI> for the largene&s;s of your Love to me. You ask <HI>who has made me a judge of Mens inward Experiences and &s;ecret State?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I pretend not to judge of Mens Experiences and State, immediately or infallibly, but only me|diately and fallibly, by the outward Signs of Speech and Action; and this our Savour allows of, when he tells us, <HI>that the Tree is known by its Fruit.</HI> And is not the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> commended for trying tho&s;e
<PB N="98" REF="005297_0098_1016F64253788710">
that &s;aid they were Apo&s;tles, and were nor, and for finding or di&s;covering them to be Lyars <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. And is not the Shepherd more particularly bid <HI>to know the State of his Flock.</HI> Prov. 27.23. How can we love the Brethren in particular, except we judge them to be &s;uch? The Truth is, a Judgment of one kind or other, concerning the States of tho&s;e with whom we conver&s;e, we cannot avoid; and therefore it is our Wi&s;dom to u&s;e Caution in forming of it: And one Thing, among others, that helps a judicious Chri&s;tian much in this Affair, is Per&s;ons relating what the Lord hath done for their Souls, or their Experiences of a Work of the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> upon their Hearts: If their Experiences be agreeable to the Holy Scrip|tures, and they be al&s;o Sound in the main Doctrines of Religion, and both be confirm'd by a holy Con|ver&s;ation, then &s;hould we judge charitably of their State, otherwi&s;e we have not Rea&s;on for it. What tho' &s;ome &s;hould be &s;ound in Principle, and regular in Life, yet if, according to their own Account, they are utterly Ignorant of the due influence of the Law and Go&s;pel upon their Hearts, or of Conviction of Sin, Communion with God, and a heavenly ha|bitual Bya&s;s of Heart, we have Rea&s;on to think that their regular Practice is but a dead Form. And doubtle&s;s great Caution &s;hould be u&s;ed in expre&s;&s;ing our Opinion concerning others States towards God, lea&s;t by ra&s;h judging, we &s;trengthen the Pre&s;ump|tuous and di&s;courage the Sincere-Hearted, hurt their Characters and hender their u&s;efulne&s;s in the World! Our Judgment of a Per&s;ons bad State, &s;hould not be expre&s;s'd, except there be &s;ome &s;ufficient Cau&s;e for it, and &s;ome valuable End can be an&s;wered by it. The contrary Practice tends to Confu&s;ion and Di&s;cord.</P>
<P>But in the mean Time may I crave leave to ask our Author this Que&s;tion, viz. <HI>Who made him a Judge of my &s;ecret Thoughts?</HI> Is it not incon&s;i&s;tent in the <HI>Ex|aminer</HI> to find fault with my judging of the pre&s;ent States of Men towards God by outward Signs, while
<PB N="99" REF="005297_0099_1016F6440DB96D80">
in the mean time he judges my Tho'ts or State with|out them, yea contrary to them? For dosn't he in effect &s;ay, I am of the <HI>Moravian</HI> Opinion, as to judging, tho' I &s;ay the contrary, and conceal my Opinion under the gui&s;e of a near Gue&s;s?&mdash;Dosn't he herein a&s;&s;ume God's unalianable Prerogative?</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> proceeds to to cite a Pa&s;&s;age from the Writings of our Oppo&s;ers in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> pag. 115, 116. which runs thus, <Q>Will Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> tell us where God required it of Ordinary Mini|&s;ters, or People, to make po&s;itive Judgment of the &s;ecret States of orderly Profe&s;&s;ors, or to &s;et up a Court of Inqui&s;ition to pry into one anothers &s;ecret State, any farther than it appears in their Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice?</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Be&s;ides what has been already ob&s;erv'd upon the Point of Juding, for Brevity's &s;ake, I &s;hall only add, that I have profe&s;&s;'d no more than what our excellent Directory inculcates, under the Head of Ordination of Mini&s;ters, in the&s;e Words, <Q>which being con&s;idered by the Presbettery, they are to proceed to enquire touching the Grace of God in him, and whether he be of &s;uch Holine&s;s of Life as is requi&s;ite in a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel.</Q></P>
<P>I think &s;eeing tho&s;e Gentlemen profe&s;s &s;o great a regard to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and have adopted her <HI>Directory</HI> in this, as well as other Points, they &s;hould have forbore comparing her with the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> upon the Account of enquiring in|to Mens &s;ecret States, or as our excellent <HI>Directory</HI> better expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>touching the Grace of God that is in them,</HI> invidiou&s;ly terming it <HI>&s;etting up a Court of Inqui|&s;ition,</HI> hereby alluding to the Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition: It's a pitty that the&s;e Men don't endeavour to be better acquainted with their profe&s;s'd Principles! Its &s;trange that they will neither act according to them&s;elves, or &s;uffer us to do &s;o without Reproach? Why are they &s;o fond of appropriating the Presbyterian Name to them&s;elves, While they take &s;o much Pains to confute Presbyterian Principles? They would act
<PB N="100" REF="005297_0100_1016F678BA4E0680">
a more con&s;i&s;tent Part, if they either renounc'd their Practice or Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Their oppo&s;ing all enquiries into Mens &s;ecret State, as they term it, gives Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect their want of experimental Religion, as well as unfaith|fulne&s;s in the mini&s;terial Work! Tho&s;e who have Chri&s;tian Experience, are &s;o far from thinking that the relating thereof is like a Spani&s;h Engine of torture, that they take gaeat Plea&s;ure, with the P&s;almi&s;t of old, in telling to tho&s;e that fear God, what the Lord has done for their Souls; and in rendering a Rea&s;on of the Hope that is within them, to every one that asketh a Que&s;tion &mdash;What a &s;uperficial &s;ort of Mini&s;ters mu&s;t tho&s;e be who oppo&s;e all en|enquiries into the State of their Flock? for without <HI>this,</HI> how can they &s;peak &s;uitably in a particular Manner, to the various Ca&s;es of their Hearers? For Mini&s;ters to try to convince or comfort Per&s;ons in their private Di&s;cour&s;e, before an Enquiry into their State, is like a Phy&s;ician's giving Do&s;es of Phy&s;ick at random, without enquiring into the Nature of the Di&s;ea&s;e that the Patient labours under. Whether &s;uch a Practice dosn't tend to kill rather than cure People, let the Reader judge.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add at pre&s;ent, to what has been &s;aid under this Head, this Sentece from my <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon, which I think is ju&s;t, tho' &s;ome, for their own Ends, de&s;pi&s;e it, namely, "That Thieves flee "a Search, lea&s;t their &s;tolen Goods &s;hould be di&s;|covered. <HI>See John</HI> 3.19, 20, 21. <HI>And this is the Con|demnation, that Light is come into the World and Men loved Darkne&s;s rather then Light, becau&s;e their Deeds were Evil; for every one that doeth Evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, lea&s;t his Deeds &s;hould be reproved. But he that loveth Truth cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made Manife&s;t that they are wrought in God.</HI></P>
<P>I ha&s;ten to the 7th In&s;tance of pretended Contra|diction, p. 18. which is borrow'd from Moravian Sermon p. 66. <Q>Do any e&s;teem this new up&s;tart
<PB N="101" REF="005297_0101_1016BA4AB0D1D938">
Moravian Sect becau&s;e of their &s;hew of Humility, while in the mean time they undervalue all but them&s;elves?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Some of the Heads of that Party have &s;poken reproachfully at <HI>New-Brun&s;wick,</HI> of all the Pro|te&s;tant reformed Churches. One of them, in my hearing compar'd them to <HI>Babel:</HI> Is this Humility to imagine them&s;elves more advanced in Grace, then all the World be&s;ides?</Q></P>
<P>The &s;uppos'd oppo&s;ite In&s;tance, is taken from the <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon p. 11. 12. where he &s;ays, <Q>I condemn the Body of the Clergy of this Gene|ration, as &s;warms of Locu&s;ts, crowds of Phari&s;ees, that have as covetou&s;ly as cruelly crept into the Mini&s;try, in this adulterous Generation; who as nearly re&s;emble the Character given of the old Phari&s;ees, as one Crows Egg does another.</Q></P>
<P>Again p. 9. <Q>the Bulk of her &s;piritual Guides, are &s;tone Blind and &s;tone Dead.</Q></P>
<P>This reproachful Cen&s;ure of the Body of the Clergy of the <HI>Prote&s;tant reformed Churches,</HI> is abun|dantly confirmed by Mr. <HI>Ts</HI> reply to Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI>'s Propo&s;al for an Accommodation in Behalf of him|&s;elf and adherents, &s;ays he, <Q>We are informed, that the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is in a very declining, degenerate State, many of her Members corrupt in Principles, and more void of the Power of Religion; as al&s;o that the Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> (I mean the Presbyterian) is notoriou&s;ly corrupted. They &s;eem to be, as far as we hear, &s;unk into a deep and dreadful Security.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We are informed that the Presbyterians in <HI>En|gland</HI> have generally but little of the Life of Re|ligion among them; and that &s;everal of them are corrupted with gro&s;s and damnable Errors. And by the be&s;t Information we can get, a dead For|mality generally prevails too much in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and many other Places of <HI>New-England.</HI> Indeed we are of Opinion that the Majority of Church-Ju|dicatories, almo&s;t every where, are dead For|mali&s;ts,
<PB N="102" REF="005297_0102_1016F645AECA8018">
if they have got that length; and therefore we incline to make no more Application to Men in the Affair afore&s;aid.</Q></P>
<Q><HI>Where then is Wi&s;dom and the Power of Godline&s;s to be found?</HI> Why truly among the little <HI>Brun&s;|wick</HI> Party, that little Flock. The Genera|lity of Prote&s;tants are but dead Formali&s;ts at be&s;t; for &s;o Mr, <HI>T.</HI> proceeds to &s;ay,</Q>
<P><Q>We are a&s;&s;ured, Gentlemen, That it is the Cau&s;e of GOD that <HI>We</HI> are engaged in, and therefore re&s;olved to defend it till Death again&s;t all Oppo|&s;ers.</Q> <HI>See Examinaiion,</HI> &amp;c. Page 9, 11, 12 <Q>The above Character given of the Mini&s;ters of our Per&s;ua&s;ion in <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> agrees well with Mr. <HI>T</HI>'s pronoun|cing the Body of the Clergy of this Generation, <HI>Judas's, hypocritical Varlets,</HI> &amp;c, *</Q></P>
<P><Q>* Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> in his Sermon at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> ap|pears as an <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> among the Body of the Clergy of this Generation.</Q></P>
<Q>Where is Mr. <HI>T</HI>'s <HI>Charity</HI> to him&s;elf and his Party &s;hewn here? and yet this is the Gentleman that has the Face to recommend the Vertue of <HI>Charity</HI> to others in his fifth Sermon, &amp;c. viz.</Q>
<P><Q>That <HI>Charity which thinketh no Evil:</HI> &s;urely then it will &s;peak none. That <HI>Charity</HI> which inclines to Mildne&s;s, Candour and Courte&s;e in Speech and Behaviour, it <HI>behaveth it&s;elf not un&s;eemly.</HI> That <HI>Charity</HI> which prefers a publick Good to a private Intere&s;t, <HI>it &s;eeketh not her own Things.</HI> And <HI>that Charity</HI> that inclines tho&s;e that po&s;&s;e&s;s it to Hu|mility, <HI>it vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up. Thou that teache&s;t another, teache&s;t thou not thy&s;elf?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Well we have had a long Story, but where is the Contradiction? Why I have faulted the <HI>Moravians</HI> for their undervaluing all but them&s;elves, and &s;peak|ing reproachfully of all the Prote&s;tant reformed Churches. And this our Author labours to make me Guilty of, by mu&s;tering up again the thread bare Story of Names, which has been before con&s;idered;
<PB N="103" REF="005297_0103_1016F64AF518ED10">
but what a poor Proof is this? Both the Pa&s;&s;ages cited do not re&s;pect the &s;ame thing, and therefore there cannot be a Contradiction in them. The one re&s;pects the Prote&s;tant reformed Churches in particular; and the other the unconverted Clergy in General, of all forts of Chri&s;tian Societies. If our Author believes that the Clergy is the Church, as it wou'd &s;eem he does, by pretending a Contradiction in tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, then he is a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> (at lea&s;t in that Point) but if he thinks that the unconverted Clergy of all the Churches in general, are the Prote&s;tant re|formed Churches in particular, (which is nece&s;&s;ary to make out the Charge again&s;t me) then he has lo&s;t <HI>Common Sen&s;e:</HI> And if he thinks that the Body of the Clergy of all Denominations are Uncon|verted, (as it would &s;eem by his charging directly upon the Body of the Clergy, tho&s;e Epithets which I charg'd directly upon the Unconverted, and but indirectly and hypothetically upon the Body of the Clergy of this Generation) I &s;ay, if the Ca&s;e be &s;o, the <HI>Examiner</HI> does him&s;elf what he finds fault with in me.</P>
<P>But be that as it will, our Author repre&s;ents my Mind unfairly, while he trys to make his Reader believe that I Charge the afore&s;aid Characters upon the Body of the Clergy directly, and carefully leaves out the Word <HI>Unconverted</HI> (as it would &s;eem) lea&s;t the Reader &s;hould form a ju&s;t Notion of my Sen|timents.</P>
<P>And when our Author mentions &s;ome part of my reply to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Dicken&s;on</HI>'s Propo&s;als, he art|fully turns what I had &s;aid in the <HI>Nottingham</HI> Sermon again&s;t unconverted Mini&s;ters of every Church in general, to the Body of the Clergy of the reform|ed Churches in particular, which tends to heighten the Charge, without a ju&s;t Ground, again&s;t that Sermon, as if I had intended in it, only the un|converted Mini&s;ters of the reformed Churches, &s;trictly &s;o called, which is really fal&s;e. The Ex|pre&s;&s;ions in the Sermon are indefinite and general,
<PB N="104" REF="005297_0104_1016F64DAD087528">
and therefore cannot, without a force upon them, be re&s;tricted, as our Author &s;ugge&s;ts. I mention in the Sermon the Badges of different Kinds of Clergymen, namely, not only Bands and Black Coats, but Gowns, (<HI>See p.</HI> 18.) which &s;hows that I had in View the Clergy of different Churches in the Compo&s;ure of it.</P>
<P>Well and what do I &s;ay in the afore&s;aid Reply, but relate a credible Account, which we have had of the declinging State of Religion in general, a|mong the Presbyterians in <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland</HI> and <HI>New-England;</HI> and was not the Relation true at that Time? If not, let the <HI>Examiner</HI> favour us with a ju&s;ter Account of the Matter, and we &s;hall be obliged to him. I &s;hould be exceeding glad to be mi&s;taken on that &s;ide of the Que&s;tion. I &s;ay what is there in the reply, but the afore&s;aid Relation, excepting that Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>the Majority of the Church Judicatory's being dead Formali&s;ts,</HI> &amp;c. But it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that the following qualifying and limiting Terms are added to it, namely, that it is not re|pre&s;ented as a Matter of ab&s;olute Certainly, but of Opinion only; and that the Words <HI>almo&s;t every where,</HI> are added thereto. Our mentioning this, after the afore&s;aid Relation of what we had been informed of, &s;hews that it was bottom'd thereupon, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Our Author next adds, &s;everal Lines of his own in the middle of the Paragraph he cites from me, which has a tendency to marr my meaning. But what is it that he is &s;o eager to utter, why this &s;illy Satyr, namely, <Q><HI>Where then is Wi&s;dom and the Power of Godline&s;s to be found?</HI> Why truly among the little <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> Party, that little Flock. The Gene|rality of Prote&s;tants are but dead Formali&s;ts, at be&s;t, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Why does the <HI>Examiner,</HI> without any Foun|dation, in&s;inuate, that I confine <HI>Wi&s;dom and the Power of Godline&s;s</HI> to my &s;elf and Brethren, or pre|fer our&s;elves to other <HI>faithful</HI> Mini&s;ters of the re|form'd
<PB N="105" REF="005297_0105_1016F650776D4520">
Churches, when there is not a Word of this Tendency in all our writings; God forbid, that we &s;hould entertain &s;uch an unrea&s;onable and de|te&s;table Opinion of our&s;elves; no we de&s;ire, as we have great Rea&s;on, to prefer others before our|&s;elves in Love, and do judge of our&s;elves, (and are willing to be tho't &s;o of others) <HI>le&s;s then the lea&s;t of all Saints.</HI></P>
<P>Neither will the Foundation our Author goes upon in the In&s;inuation afore&s;aid, bear the Stre&s;s he lays upon it. What if we had &s;aid, <HI>That the gene|rality of Prote&s;tants are but dead Formali&s;ts at be&s;t.</HI> Will nor the Scripture &s;upport &s;uch an A&s;&s;ertion, while they inform us, That <HI>many are call'd and few cho|&s;en,</HI> That <HI>Strait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leads to Life, and that few find it,</HI> That <HI>many &s;hall &s;eek to enter in and &s;hall not be able.</HI> And dons't the Para|ble of the Sower give farther Light and Force to this Argument? For therein, but one in four received the Word aright. Do&s;n't the <HI>Examiners</HI> offering the afore&s;aid particular, as an Objection again&s;t us, betray gro&s;s Ignorance of the Scriptures, and look like an utter unacquaintedne&s;s with expe|rimental Religion?</P>
<P>Our Author adds another Paragraph of his own to this Effect. <Q>Where is Mr. <HI>Tennent's</HI> Charity to him&s;elf and his Party &s;hewn here? and this is the Gentleman, that has the Face to recom|mend Charity to others in his 5th Sermon.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I &s;ee no uncharitablene&s;s in a&s;&s;erting that to be the Cau&s;e of God, which we were then and are &s;till endeavouring to promote; namely, <HI>experimental and practical Religion,</HI> and in a re&s;olute oppo&s;ing of two Acts made by a Majority of the Synod, which we were and are &s;till per&s;waded had a Tendency to ob&s;truct the &s;ame, tho' doubtle&s;s they appeared to others of our Brethren (&s;ome of whom we believe are heartily engag'd in promoting experimental Pie|ty) in another Light. The&s;e Acts which I have mentioned in my Remarks upon their prote&s;t, gave

<P>I &s;till approve of the De&s;cription of <HI>Charity,</HI> which our Author cites from my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon: And am per&s;waded that I have acted according to it, in &s;etting forth the Danger of an ungodly Mini|&s;try; but this I have &s;poke upon before, and there|fore mu&s;t not in&s;i&s;t here.</P>
<P>Only I mu&s;t beg leave to ask our Author, who profe&s;&s;es &s;o much Charity, how he can reconcile therewith his manifold unju&s;t dealing with me, and his patronizing the ungodly Mini&s;try, his grum|bling and taking it ill that they &s;hould have their ju&s;t Characters? while in the mean Time he favours heretical <HI>Moravians,</HI> and other Shi&s;maticks this way, and adopts their invidious Character of me, viz. <Q>That I appear in my <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon, as <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> among the Body of the Clergy of this Generation.</Q>&mdash; While in the mean Time he &s;lights and oppo&s;es tho&s;e pious Mini&s;ters in general, who have been in&s;tru|mental in promoting the late Reformation. To oppo&s;e and detect ungodly Mini&s;ters, does it not look more like the Practice of <HI>Jeremiah</HI> and <HI>Micajah,</HI> then of <HI>I&s;hmael?</HI> And now Sir, I beg you wont take it ami&s;s, if in the Conclu&s;ion of this Paragraph, I re|turn your Que&s;tion, <HI>thou that teache&s;t another, teache&s;t thou not thy &s;elf?</HI></P>
<P>Having now con&s;idered our Authors Charges as to pretended Incon&s;i&s;tencies in Doctine, let us pro|ceed to examine his Compari&s;on of the Conver&s;ion, and after Experiencies &s;aid to be propogated by Mr. <HI>T.</HI> and his Party; and this our Author is plea&s;ed to introduce, with an Apoligy for Count <HI>Zinzendorff</HI> and Mr. <HI>Betener's</HI> contradicting of them&s;elves, p. 20. He asks, <Q>Why I deny to tho&s;e Moravian Gen|tlemen, the Liberty I take to my &s;elf to &s;ay and un&s;ay Things as it liketh me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="005297_0107_1016F655E8279250"><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I have never taken &s;uch a Liberty, and I hope never &s;hall, and as our Author has not nor cannot prove his malignant Charge, it is &s;landerous cruel Calumny, which may God of his infinite Mercy forgive.</P>
<P>And now we come to our Authors Charge, p. 21. which is as follows, quoted from <HI>p.</HI> 103 of the <HI>Apendix.</HI></P>
<Q><P>The <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of the mo&s;t of them, is very &s;lighty, done in a Moment; have we not rea&s;on to fear their Conver&s;ion is but a &s;trong flight of I|magination, a Satanical Delu&s;ion?</P>
<P>And we have more rea&s;on for the Fear afore|&s;aid, when we con&s;ider how ea&s;ie they are ge|nerally, after their &s;uppo&s;ed Conver&s;ion, with|out <HI>Fears,</HI> without <HI>complaints of Sin, &amp;c.</HI> did not the Seed &s;own on the &s;tony Ground, <HI>&s;pring up quickly;</HI> but on the Contrary, did not the good Ground <HI>bring forth fruit with Patience?</HI></P>
<P>If we will believe the Scriptures, does not their Conver&s;ion and after Experiencies, look like <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI> and <HI>Delu&s;ion?</HI></P></Q>
<P>In the oppo&s;ite Collumn are the&s;e Words, <Q>If we are to judge of the <HI>un&s;oundne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> by the Suddainne&s;s thereof, have we not as much Rea|&s;on to fear, that the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of many among the <HI>N. Brun&s;wick</HI> Party, is a &s;trong flight of Imagina|tion, or a Satanical Delu&s;ion?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Even &s;uch is the ea&s;y, quiet, happy State of Multitudes of the late Converts, without fear, without Complaints, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Why then &s;hould the State of the one, be better and &s;afer then that of the other?</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> It is invidious in our Author &s;till to keep up the contemptuous title Page over the Heads of his Collumns; while in the mean Time he puts his own Words in one of them, and not mine; but to pa&s;s this.</P>
<P>I beg leave to ob&s;erve that our Author is very partial and defective in his Repre&s;entation of the
<PB N="108" REF="005297_0108_1016F657C82F0C08">
Rea&s;ons of my Fears, re&s;pecting the <HI>Moravian</HI> Con|ver&s;ion, he picks up a piece of a Sentence here and there, and leaves out the chief Part; to make this appear I will cite the whole Paragraphs he re|fers to, and they are the&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>As to their Conver&s;ion and after Experiencies, the Conver&s;ion of the mo&s;t of them (if we credit the <HI>Count's</HI> A&s;&s;ertion, and we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that he knows pretty well the State of his own Sect) is very &s;lighty, its without any Preparatory Law Work, done in a Moment. If they have received the afore&s;aid Doctrines, have we not Rea&s;on to fear that their Conver&s;ion is but a &s;trong flight of Imagination, or a Satanical Delu&s;ion. And we have the more Rea&s;on for the Fear afore&s;aid, when we con&s;ider how <HI>Ea&s;y</HI> they are generally after their &s;uppos'd Conver&s;ion, without Fears, without Complaints of Sin, Stran|gers to the Spiritual War, Stangers to the Know|ledge of their own Hearts, always in one &s;ort of Frame, or as it were put to Sleep and happy, as the <HI>Count</HI> expre&s;&s;es it. did not the Seed &s;own on the Stony Ground <HI>&s;pring up quickly?</HI> but on the Contrary, did not the good Ground <HI>bring forth Fruit with Patience?</HI> did not the poor Man in the Go&s;|ple <HI>bewail his unbelief?</HI> And are we not commanded <HI>to fight the Fight of Faith?</HI> If we will believe the Scriptures, does not their Conver&s;ion and Expe|riences look like <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI> and <HI>Delu&s;ion?</HI> Their Ignorance about the Nature of a true and &s;aving Faith, adds awful weight to what has been now ob&s;erv'd.</Q></P>
<P>Here the Reader may ea&s;ily perceive, that what I have &s;aid re&s;pecting the Suddainne&s;s of their Con-Conver&s;ion, is join'd in the &s;ame Sentence with their want of a Preparatory law Work, upon which the principle Stre&s;s is laid.&mdash;</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what I have &s;aid of their <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> after <HI>Conver|&s;ion,</HI> is join'd with the Account of their being Strangers to the &s;piritual War, and the Knowledge
<PB N="109" REF="005297_0109_1016F65A7A82D608">
of their own Hearts; my Fears re&s;pecting their Conver&s;ion, are likewi&s;e bottom'd upon the Sup|po&s;ition of their receiving or embracing the dread|ful Doctrines contain'd in the Apendix, particular|ly upon their a&s;&s;erting <HI>hi&s;torical Faith to be &s;aving,</HI> and their rejecting of <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>Do&s;n't our Author know in his Con&s;cience, that the&s;e things can't be ju&s;tly charg'd upon us, God knoweth that we abhor them. What a wicked and &s;hamele&s;s Part does the <HI>Examiner</HI> then Act, in his partial deceitful Application? And how un|rea&s;onable is his Query from thence, viz. <HI>Why then &s;hould the State of the one be better and &s;afer than the other?</HI> Has our Author then no regard to the precious Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity which the <HI>Moravians</HI> op|po&s;e? Has he no re&s;pect for the <HI>Law of God,</HI> and a <HI>preparative</HI> Work of it?</P>
<P>As to what our Author &s;ays concerning Multi|tudes of the late Converts, being in an ea&s;ie, quiet and happy State without Fear.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> That &s;ome are deceiv'd re&s;pecting their State towards God, who have been under good Im|pre&s;&s;ions during the late revival of Religion in this Land, I doubt not. This is but a u&s;ual Event, and therefore no way di&s;parages God's Work, <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI> flows from the Sophi&s;try of Satan, who blinds the Eyes of tho&s;e that believe not, and from the <HI>Corrup|tion</HI> of Mens Hearts, which are <HI>deceitful and de&s;pe|rately wicked.</HI> It cannot be therefore charg'd upon Mini&s;ters, except they preach Doctrines that tend thereto; which we defy the <HI>Examiner</HI> to prove upon us. If our Doctrines had been of a <HI>pre&s;umptious</HI> Tenden|cy, is it probable that &s;o many Thou&s;ands would have been alarmed by them, out of their Security? And therefore the <HI>Examiner</HI> is guilty of a notori|ous fal&s;ehood, when he &s;ays, p. 21. That &s;uch a <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Experiencies</HI> as he de&s;cribes, was pro|pogated by me and my Party. Whereas the Al|mighty knows and many of his People, among whom we have labour'd, that it has been our Prin|ciple
<PB N="110" REF="005297_0110_1016F65F95FBD2A8">
endeavour to &s;ap the Foundations of a Fal&s;e hope.</P>
<P>Our Author mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I can't &s;o ea&s;ily credit his A&s;&s;ertion, as to the multitudes of the late <HI>Converts being without Fear,</HI> &amp;c. he has &s;o often fail'd in his Charges again&s;t me, that I can't but Que&s;ti|on his Veracity, e&s;pecially when he is prejudiced, as he certainly is again&s;t the late revival of Religi|on, &s;ee p. 24. What good do the <HI>Itenerants</HI> do by "their Traveling, unle&s;s it be to &s;ow Tares to "corrupt and devide religious People?</P>
<P>Here the Examiner ab&s;olutely denys, that any good was done by <HI>Itinerary preachers.</HI> And yet he owns p. 27. That &s;ome were brought under a pre|paratory Work of the Law by my Mini&s;try (who am doubtle&s;s intended us one of them) in the&s;e Words, <Q>It notioious that he him&s;elf not only &s;mil'd but laugh'd heartily over his Converts, while they were under a preparatory Work of the Law.</Q> Now the <HI>Examiner</HI> mu&s;t either acknowledge that it is doing no good to bring (in&s;trumentaly) &s;e|cure &s;inners under a preparatory Work of the Law, or confe&s;s his Contradiction. Be&s;ides a Contradic|tion to the afore&s;aid pa&s;&s;age is imply'd, in his Words that I am now con&s;idering: For while he &s;ays, That <HI>Multitudes of the late Converts are without Fear,</HI> this plainly &s;uppo&s;es that &s;ome of them are not. And &s;o that there has been &s;ome good done by the <HI>Itinerary</HI> Preachers, who have been us'd as Principle In|&s;truments in promoting the late Conver&s;ions. And indeed this, the <HI>Examiner</HI> in &s;ome &s;ort confe&s;&s;es in relation to my &s;elf, while he calls me <HI>a Principal mover and promoter of the pa&s;&s;ionate Religion now prevailing among &s;o many, p.</HI> 26.</P>
<P>It is not probable that our Author wou'd conver&s;e with &s;o many of the late Converts as he talks of, con&s;idering his pre&s;ent Prejudice, and therefore his knowledge mu&s;t come by the Information of others, who its like were as much prejudiced as him&s;elf. I belive I have had an opportunity of conver&s;ing
<PB N="111" REF="005297_0111_1016F6611CB30FA8">
with more of them then our Author, by Rea&s;on of my Travels. And I mu&s;t declare to the Glory of divine Grace, that I have met with Multitudes, who in the Judgment of a Scriptural and rea&s;ona|ble Charity, had the plain Signatures of a &s;pecial Work of God upon their Souls.</P>
<P>The principal Members of the Presbytery of <HI>New-York,</HI> have the la&s;t Year in their Prote&s;t, given their &s;olemn &s;ufferage to the reality of the late revival of Religion in this Land, and this Year both our <HI>Presbyteries</HI> viz. of <HI>New-Brun&s;wick</HI> and <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> have given a unanimous Declaration in behalf of God's Work, which has been &s;weetly &s;preading among us lately. Ble&s;&s;ed be <HI>Jehovah</HI> for it.</P>
<P>And now let us proceed to our Authors, 22d. p. and here he ob&s;erves that I &s;ay in <HI>p.</HI> 8. of my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon thus. <Q>What is the <HI>Moravian</HI> Faith, but a &s;orry mu&s;hroom, of a nights growth unworthy of the name of Faith.</Q></P>
<P>Upon the oppo&s;ite Collumn to which the <HI>Exami|ner</HI> in&s;erts the&s;e Words of his own. <Q>Yea and all &s;uch like &s;uddain Conver&s;ions, are equally Pre|&s;umptuous and Delu&s;ive, but as a &s;orry mu&s;hroom of a Nights Growth.</Q></P>
<P>Here let the reader ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Examiner</HI> wrongs me in not repre&s;enting my true Sen&s;e and Meaning. He only cites a &s;hort Conclu&s;ion, which I drew from certain Premi&s;es, in which my Opini|on was explain'd without mentioning the Premi|&s;es them&s;elves, <HI>E. G.</HI> He has (as it &s;eems) purpos|ly left out the following Lines, which do immediately go before what he related, and fully &s;hew my meaning, namely, <Q>What then can we rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that Faith to be, which has no humbling Preparatives, no after Conflicts and Troubles, and con&s;i&s;t not in a receiving of CHRIST, and re&s;ting upon him for Salvation?</Q> And then follow the Words he has cited.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="005297_0112_1016F66422688478">The reader may ea&s;ily &s;ee, how partial and un|ju&s;t his compari&s;on is, and therefore Inconclu&s;ive, whatever &s;uddain Conver&s;ions there be, attended with the afore&s;aid Characters; we reject them and believe them to be but <HI>&s;orry Mu&s;hrooms;</HI> but we dare not reject <HI>Conver&s;ions</HI> meerly becau&s;e of their Suddain|ne&s;s, if the&s;e Per&s;ons have had humbling Prepa|ratives, have been enabled to receive CHRIST, and re&s;t upon him for Salvation; have after conflicts, and a general free bent of Heart, and Practice Godward and Heavenward.</P>
<P>And <HI>this</HI> we have the fulle&s;t Evidence, that the Nature of &s;uch Things can admitt of, is the Ca&s;e of many who have been, during the late glorious revival of Religion, brought from a State of Na|ture to a State of Grace in this Land. We dare not pre&s;ume to bound Omnipotence, or &s;et limits to the Operations of an infinitely &s;overeign God, in his bringing fallen Creatures to an intere&s;t in his Love. His Spirit blows when and where he li&s;teth.</P>
<P>And indeed I can't but think the <HI>Examiner</HI> is pro|fanely bold in doing &s;o, in tho&s;e Lines of his which I but ju&s;t now mentioned. At this rate of pro|ceeding the mo&s;t of the <HI>Conver&s;ions</HI> in the Apo&s;tolick Times, mu&s;t be condemned as <HI>Mu&s;hrooms,</HI> for was not the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>three Thou&s;and</HI> as well as of <HI>Paul, Zacheus</HI> and <HI>Lydia,</HI> &s;uddain?</P>
<P>And what tho' &s;uddain <HI>Conver&s;ions</HI> be followed with Raptures, if they have the Antecedents, Concom|mitants and Effects, before mentioned, they &s;hould not be rejected on the Account of them. For are we not told, That <HI>the Kingdom of God con&s;i&s;ts in Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, Peace and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI> And didn't &s;ome in the primitive Times receive the Word with <HI>Joy,</HI> yea <HI>rejoice with Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory,</HI> and what can be greater than this?</P>
<P>If Per&s;ons after much &s;orrow and unea&s;ine&s;s, upon their meeting with &s;ome unexpected and im|portant temporal Good, have been &s;o overcome with
<PB N="113" REF="005297_0113_1016F66606C71F68">
Joy and Rapture, that they have fainted away; is it any wonder that divine Things &s;hou'd affect as much, which are of infinitely greater Weight and Con&s;equence, when they are beheld by that <HI>Faith which is the Sub&s;tance of Things not &s;een, and the Evi|dence of things hoped for.</HI> Certainly the greater Di&s;tre&s;s Per&s;ons are in before they receive Comfort, thro' a &s;ight of God's Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s, as well as of their own Vilene&s;s, together with the Fears of impending Vengeance, the more in Proportion they are wont to be affected with a Sen&s;e of pardoning Mercy.</P>
<P>I remember to have heard in the famous Story of <HI>Ma&s;&s;ianello</HI> the <HI>Neapolitan,</HI> that during his Re|gency, &s;ome poor Man that had received certain valuable temporal Pre&s;ents, was &s;o tran&s;ported there|with, that he cry'd out frequently in the open Street, before a great Concour&s;e of People, <HI>all this is mine, all this is mine.</HI> And when &s;ome Body pre&s;ent de&s;i|red him to be &s;till, telling him that &s;uch behaviour was un&s;eemly, he reply'd, <HI>That he needn't wonder that he cry'd out &s;o, but rather that he didn't take up Stones and throw at him</HI> He was &s;o mad for Joy.</P>
<P>If <HI>Archimedes</HI> when he had found out &s;ome Ma|thematical Demon&s;tration, was &s;o tran&s;ported with it, that he cry'd out, <HI>Eureca, Eureca, I have found, I have found.</HI> Is it &s;trange that &s;ome of &s;ofter and &s;tronger Pa&s;&s;ions, who after a view of their forlorn State, upon finding the <HI>Pearl of great Price;</HI> &s;hould be &s;o tran&s;por|ted with a Sen&s;e of God's imerited and immen&s;e Good|ne&s;s, as that they coud'nt refrain crying out with the Spou&s;e in the Song of Songs. <HI>I have found him whom my Soul loveth.</HI></P>
<P>I have heard of one who was condemn'd to be hang'd for &s;ome notorious Crime, in con&s;equence of which after Impri&s;onment, he was carried to the Gallows; but behold a Pardon being brought to him, while he was within view of the awful In&s;tru|ment of Execution, overcame him with &s;uch an exce&s;s of joy, as made him expire in Death.
<PB N="114" REF="005297_0114_1016F667CD642578">
What I have &s;aid el&s;ewhere concerning the Souls near union to the Body, and its con&s;equent Influ|ence upon it, is applicable here.</P>
<P>And now before I proceed farther, I mu&s;t ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Examiner</HI> has wrong'd me in the Application afore&s;aid, by in&s;inuating that I &s;poke again&s;t <HI>&s;uddain Conver&s;ions,</HI> or <HI>joyous Raptures</HI> altogether, whereas I only &s;poke again&s;t &s;uch, as had not &s;uita|ble Antecedents, Concommitants and Effects, as was before ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>He has likewi&s;e offended again&s;t the Generation of God's Children, by condemning all of them that have been converted &s;uddainly. Let the <HI>Exami|ner</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the following Place of Scrip|ture, Matt. 18.6. <HI>He that offends one of tho&s;e little ones who believe in me, it were better for him that a Mill|&s;tone was hung about his Neck and he ca&s;t into the mid&s;t of the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author in his next Paragraph mentions what I &s;ay p. 66. of my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon.&mdash; <Q>Thus do any e&s;teem this new up&s;tart <HI>Moravian</HI> Sect, becau&s;e they &s;ay they have Communion with God, and in Con&s;equence hereof Joy and Sweet|ne&s;s. I an&s;wer when we con&s;ider the <HI>Antinornian</HI> Principles they hold concerning <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;ti|fication,</HI> as well as the proud Effects of their pre|tended <HI>Good Frames,</HI> and that under a Mask of <HI>Humility,</HI> &amp;c. we have good Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect their <HI>Communion</HI> to be but a Delu&s;ion of the grand Enemy, and their <HI>Joys</HI> to be the <HI>Joys</HI> of Time Believers, and &s;tony Ground Hearers. True <HI>Communion</HI> with God doth certainly <HI>humble</HI> the Soul, <HI>Job</HI> 42.5.6. It's no new Thing for <HI>Antino|mians</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> to talk of Joys and Comforts but they are a fal&s;e cure to all Soul Troubles.</Q></P>
<P>In the oppo&s;ite Collumn he mentions the follow|ing Words of his own, viz. <Q>every reader of common Ob&s;ervation, will find the Tran&s;ition very ea&s;y, from the <HI>Moravians</HI> to many of the Converts now a Days, who talk boldly of their high
<PB N="115" REF="005297_0115_1016F66D30A579D8">
Joys and full A&s;&s;urances, under a mask of Hu|mility, and at the &s;ame Time <HI>tru&s;ting in them&s;elves, that they are Righteous and de&s;pi&s;ing others.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Let them not be high minded but fear,</HI> lea&s;t their Communion be but a Delu&s;ion, and their Joys the Joys of &s;tony Ground Hearers.</Q></P>
<P>By comparing tho&s;e Paragraphs, every Eye may &s;ee the <HI>Examiners</HI> Partiality, in applying what I have &s;aid concerning the Joys of the <HI>Maravians,</HI> to many of the late Converts, for in his Compari&s;on, he omits one of the principle Rea&s;ons of my &s;u&s;|pecting the <HI>Moravian</HI> Joys, namely their <HI>Antinomian</HI> Principles, concerning <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> he in|deed mentions proud Effects, namely <HI>tru&s;ting in them|&s;elves and de&s;pi&s;ing others,</HI> and if the Ca&s;e be truly and habitually &s;o with any, it is an awful &s;ign of De|lu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But perhaps our Author, has term'd a rea&s;ona|ble rejoycing in the A&s;&s;urance of God's Love, a mode&s;t and &s;ea&s;onable di&s;cour&s;ing thereof to others, together with a faithful Endeavour to detect and awaken &s;ecure Hypocrits, and dry Formali&s;ts, <HI>a talk|ing boldly of their high Joys, and tru&s;ting in them&s;elves and de&s;pi&s;ing of others,</HI> becau&s;e of his &s;trong Prejudice and repeated Partiality. In the mean Time I woudn't be under&s;tood to &s;ignify, as if I believ'd that all who recond them&s;elves Converted, or were e&s;teem'd &s;o by others, during the late revival of Religion were really &s;o: No not at all, neither is this any di&s;pa|ragement to the Work of God. For thus it was in the Apo&s;tolick Times.</P>
<P>But to conclude, what I wou'd offer upon this Head of <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the <HI>Examiner</HI> is mo&s;t unju&s;t in a&s;&s;erting in the <HI>Title</HI> thereof, that I and tho&s;e whom he calls my Party, propogate &s;uch a manner of <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> and after <HI>Experience,</HI> as he relates in the oppo&s;ite Collumn to my Words.

Why does our Au|thor unju&s;tly charge upon us, the Crimes of the <HI>Devil</HI> and the <HI>ungodly,</HI> who are under his Influence, while we dete&s;t them in our Hearts, and endea|vour to detect and oppo&s;e them by our Speech and Practice.</P>
<P>And now we are prepar'd to con&s;ider another part of the <HI>Examiners</HI> Performance, which he entitles thus, <HI>Mr.</HI> T's <HI>Reflections on the Spirit of the</HI> Moravians, <HI>compared with his own Spirit and of his Adherents.</HI></P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;ages of mine which he cites, are <HI>Ap|pendix, Moravian</HI> Sermon, p. 104. the Words are the&s;e, <Q>Are not the <HI>Moravians,</HI> many of them, <HI>uncharitable</HI> and <HI>divi&s;ive</HI> in their Speech and Practice, and that under a pretext of <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Catholici&s;m.</HI> Witne&s;s Mr. SPANGENBERG'S comparing the <HI>Pro|te&s;tant Churches</HI> to a <HI>Babel,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Witne&s;s their not being willing to join with a|ny Prote&s;tant Body of Men, and yet their re|ceiving Per&s;ons of divers Societys to their Fellow|&s;hip, with little Examination into their Principles.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="005297_0117_1016F6734E824390">On the oppo&s;ite Collumn to what has been men|tioned, he &s;peaks thus <Q>And are not Mr. <HI>T.</HI> and many of his zealous Advocates ju&s;t like them? Witne&s;s his Sermon at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> which is as full of <HI>uncharitable</HI> and <HI>divi&s;ive</HI> Principles and Speeches, as a Crows Egg is full of Meat.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Witne&s;s al&s;o Mr. <HI>T.</HI> and many of our late Zealots, Mini&s;ters and others, who have been ready to cen&s;ure and &s;eparate from all that differ'd in Sentiment from them, but at the &s;ame Time receiving into their Fellow&s;hip, and with Charity eno', every one that pretended to be of their Way, pronouncing them true <HI>Converts</HI> upon little Examination, and proof of a Work of Grace in them.</Q></P>
<P>Here let the reader note, that what the <HI>Examiner</HI> objects, re&s;pecting (pretended) <HI>uncharitablene&s;s</HI> and <HI>dividing Principles</HI> in the <HI>Notingham</HI> Sermon, has been before largely con&s;idered, and therefore I &s;hall not now re&s;ume what has been &s;aid. But &s;uppo&s;ing I had been under &s;ome mi&s;takes in that Sermon, I &s;ee no Ju&s;tice in his charging them upon my Brethren, except he proves their Con&s;ent thereto which he has not &s;o much as attempted.</P>
<P>But in An&s;wer to his next Charge again&s;t me, namely a <HI>readine&s;s to cen&s;ure and &s;eparate, from all that differed from me in Sentiment.</HI> I &s;hall mention a Pa|ragraph of our Apology offer'd to the Con&s;ideration of the Synod, &s;ome Con&s;iderable Time before the Rupture happened, which runs thus. <Q>To conclude we profe&s;s a hearty Charity for tho&s;e Gentlemen who are on the other Side of the Que&s;tion in this Debate, doubtle&s;s Things appear to them in ano|ther Light, we have only in the Cour&s;e of our Rea&s;onings, labour'd to expo&s;e the Ab&s;urdity of an Opinion which we think prejudicial to the Intere&s;ts of the Saviours Kingdom, and if we are herein mi&s;taken, we are willing to be convinced by Scripture and Rea&s;on. But whether we get Conviction or not by our Brethrens Arguments
<PB N="118" REF="005297_0118_1016F677343BE320">
we believe that <HI>the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace</HI> may be pre&s;erved, notwith&s;tanding a di|ver&s;ity of Sentiment in le&s;&s;er Things, if mode|rate Councils be followed, and that mutual for|bearance be allowed, which the Go&s;pel of CHRIST requires.</Q> See remarks upon a <HI>Prote&s;t|tation, pag.</HI> 68. The afore&s;aid Apology was &s;ign'd by divers Mini&s;ters of our Number. The &s;ame Thing in Sub&s;tance I have likewi&s;e expre&s;s'd in the 19 p. of the Remarks afore&s;aid, thus: But <Q>tho' we did Prote&s;t again&s;t what we apprehended (after deliberate enquirys) to be wrong in our Brethrens Conduct, a practice not unu&s;ual in ju|dicatorys of our Denomination, yet we were far from carrying Matters to the pre&s;ent Cri&s;is, which our Bretheren have done by their Pro|te&s;t, namely, to exclude our di&s;&s;enting Brethren, from Communion upon that Account.</Q> And p. 9. are the&s;e Words.</P>
<P><Q>The Truth is, tho' we differed in Sentiments from our Brethren, in re&s;pect of &s;ome Acts or Cannons they had made, yet we de&s;igned no Se|paration from them upon that Account, we tho't that mutual Forbearance would be the be&s;t Expe|dient in the Ca&s;e afore&s;aid. As we de&s;ired liber|ty of acting according to our Con&s;ciences, in the controverted Affair, &s;o we were far from a de&s;ire of impo&s;ing our Judgment upon our Brethren, or imagining that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of Separa|tion, upon the Account of the afore&s;aid diver&s;ity of Sentiment.</Q></P>
<P>Now what regard can it be re&s;onably &s;uppos'd the <HI>Examiner</HI> has either to <HI>Truth</HI> or <HI>Charity,</HI> when he a&s;&s;erts an ab&s;olute <HI>Fal&s;ehood,</HI> while he had our &s;olemn publick mutual Declaration in his Hands to convince him thereof.</P>
<P>And here let me farther ob&s;erve, that in Pur|&s;uance of the afore&s;aid Declaration, we kept Syno|dical Communion with them, until they after an il|legal, unpre&s;idented and unju&s;t Manner, violently

and abruptly broke communion with us by a Prote&s;t without allowing us Liberty to &s;peak in our own Defence, before the Prote&s;t was &s;igned, tho' it was again and again de&s;ired. See now Mr. <HI>Examiner</HI> your partiality in favouring &s;uch <HI>Schi&s;maticks,</HI> and in con|demning the <HI>Innocent</HI> with their Crimes, and be at la&s;t a&s;hamed of your unaccountable Conduct.</P>
<P>If &s;ome who have favour'd the late Reformation in <HI>New-England,</HI> have been ting'd with a &s;eparating Spirit, or Di&s;po&s;ition to abandon abruptly the Mi|ni&s;try of any that were &s;ound in Principle, blamele&s;s in Practice, and favourers of God's Work, as it has been reported, it de&s;erves Cen&s;ure, and calls aloud for Lamentation&punc;</P>
<P>But why do you Sir impute their Faults to me? when you know in your Con&s;cience, that I have op|pos'd &s;uch Separations there, as appears by the Ser|mons which you &s;o much contemn, (as afore&s;aid) and my Letter to the Rev. Mr. JONATHAN DICKINSON, and the other which was wrote to explain it more fully (which you Cen&s;ure) Pray Sir con&s;ider whether you are not very incon&s;i&s;tent with your&s;elf in this Point, ina&s;much as while you Cen&s;ure me, without Foundation, as being of a <HI>divi&s;ive Spirit,</HI> you try by many Methods to ca&s;t di&s;|honour upon my <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> again&s;t it, and favour tho&s;e that are guilty of it?</P>
<P>As to what you &s;ay in the latter Part of your Pa|ragraph, of <HI>my receiving into Fellow&s;hip, with</HI> Charity <HI>enough, every one that pretend to be of our way, pronoun|cing them true</HI> Converts <HI>upon little Examination and Proof of a Work of Grace in them.</HI></P>
<P>I would ob&s;erve that you Contradict your&s;elf in two particulars, 1&s;t In blaming me for exce&s;&s;ive Charity; when in divers other Places in your Per|formance, you Blame me for the Contrary, <HI>See p.</HI> 13. And 2d. In Blaming me for Examining too little concerning <HI>a Work of Grace</HI> in Per&s;ons; while you Blame me el&s;ewhere, <HI>viz. pag</HI> 17. for attempting to do any &s;uch Thing at all; your Words are, <HI>Who
<PB N="120" REF="005297_0120_1016F67A46389720">
made thee a Judge of Mens inward Experience and &s;ecret State.</HI> After which you adopt the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> Words, who compare it to the <HI>Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition.</HI>&mdash;But per|haps you will &s;ay in An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Particular, that it was only a <HI>Party Charity</HI> you faulted me for, and charg'd me with. To which I reply, that the Accu&s;ation is fal&s;e. My Soul abhors the &s;ordid Meane&s;le&s;s and contracted Views of <HI>Biggotry</HI> and <HI>Party Zeal!</HI> I have a Witne&s;s in Heaven and many upon Earth, that my chief De&s;ire and Labours have been (&s;ince Almighty God has of his free Mercy given me the &s;aving Knowledge of him&s;elf) to promote <HI>vital Religion,</HI> and not any Party what&s;oever. And I have likewi&s;e great Rea&s;on to believe that this is the Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of all the Mini&s;ters that join with me in the&s;e Parts. There is one indeed, who is I hope a pious Man, Mr. ALEXANDER CRAIGHEAD, by Name, who was formerly in a State of Union with us, but having more Zeal and Po&s;itivene&s;s than Knowledge and Judgment, has Schi&s;matically broken Communion with us, and adopt'd the rigid <HI>Cameronian</HI> Scheme. He is indeed ringed with an <HI>uncharitable</HI> and <HI>party</HI> Spirit, to the prejudice of real Religion in &s;ome Places this Way May the Almighty forgive him and rectify his Judg|ment. His late and pre&s;ent cen&s;orious Temper and divi&s;ive Conduct, we utterly dete&s;t and di&s;claim.</P>
<P>I think the Rev. Mr. <HI>WHITEFIELD</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation, in one of his Letters concerning the <HI>Covenanting Scheme,</HI> is very ju&s;t and true, viz. <HI>That it is two narrow a Foun|dation to build any great Super&s;tructure upon.</HI> And on the contrary I cannot but highly approve of the catholick, generous and noble Sentiments of the very Rev. Dr. BATES and Mr. HOW, who ob&s;erve a ju&s;t Me|dium between two dangerous Extremes of a <HI>rigorous Severity</HI> upon the one Hand, and a <HI>perilous Laxne&s;s</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>And I am likewi&s;e far from approving of divers Particulars which are Charged upon Mr. DAVEN|PORT'S Conduct; one of which is, as the Re|port
<PB N="121" REF="005297_0121_1016F67D548E6F98">
goes, That after he has examined Mini&s;ters a|bout the State of their Souls, he has publickly in the open Congregation declared his Opinion concern|ing their bad State, and exhorted their Hearers to leave them. My Abhorrence of this Practice I have expre&s;s'd in a Letter to Mr. DICKINSON, which has been made Publick, to which I refer the Reader. And the late Story about Burning divers valuable Books at <HI>New London</HI> in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> is like|wi&s;e exceeding Scandalous and Ridiculous, and de|&s;erves to be dete&s;ted by all Mankind (but I am glad that I can now, upon a certain Foundation, in|form the Publick, that Mr <HI>Davenport</HI> appears to be deeply &s;en&s;ible of his criminal Conduct in that Affair.)</P>
<P>It is likely that Mr. DAVENPORT and Mr. CRAIGHEAD, by their imprudent Conduct, have been acce&s;&s;ory to the creating and fomenting of Divi&s;ions in &s;everal Parts of this Country, which is much to be lamented: And while I am con|&s;train'd, by the Regard I have to the Honour of God and intere&s;t of his Kingdom, to bear a publick Te&s;timony again&s;t the exceptionable Conduct of the&s;e Mini&s;ters before mentioned, in the mean Time I declare, that I cannot but love their Per&s;ons, and believe that in the &s;implicity of their Hearts they have gone a&s;tray. I likewi&s;e acknowledge, to the Glory of God's Sovereign Grace, that I have Rea|&s;on to believe, that both of them have been In&s;tru|ments of doing remarkable Service to many Souls.</P>
<P>But why does our <HI>Examiner</HI> unju&s;tly Charge the Mi&s;conduct of either of tho&s;e Gentlemen upon us, who have never encouraged it? But on the Contrary our Author mu&s;t need know in his Con&s;cience, that I have expre&s;ly oppos'd the Mi&s;conduct of one of them, in my printed Sermons and Letters.</P>
<P>The next Particular the <HI>Examiner</HI> mentions, is borrow'd from p. 65 of my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon, which is thus expre&s;s'd, <Q>How very different are the Fruits of their coming into the Country from the
<PB N="122" REF="005297_0122_1016F68058625328">
Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD's? His plain and pungent Preaching the Truths of the Reforma|tion, united generally the Hearts of good Men thro' the Land. But the <HI>Moravians</HI> wherever they have any Influence divide the People of God, and &s;et them a jangling. <HI>See p.</HI> 23. 24</Q></P>
<P>In the oppo&s;ite Collumn to which, the <HI>Examiner</HI> mentions the&s;e Words of his own, namely, <Q>Has not the coming of the Rev. Me&s;&s;irs. <HI>W.</HI> and <HI>T.</HI> and their Succe&s;&s;ors, into the&s;e Provinces <HI>divided the People of God, and &s;et them a Jangling,</HI> as much as the Preregrination of the <HI>Moravians</HI> in <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> has done there?</Q></P>
<P><Q>But it &s;eems Mr. <HI>T.</HI> hath felt the bad Effects of their <HI>uncharitable intru&s;ive Spirit</HI> near home, which makes him complain and flinch as much as his Neighbours, who felt the Weight of his rough Hands and heavy Fi&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The <HI>Examiner</HI>'s Application of the afore|&s;aid In&s;tance to Mr. <HI>WHITEFIELD</HI> and me, is un|ju&s;t and untrue which many Thou&s;ands in <HI>N. England</HI> can witne&s;s: When Mr. <HI>WHITEFIELD</HI> and I left <HI>N. England</HI> there was no &s;uch <HI>divi&s;ions</HI> and <HI>janglings</HI> as have &s;ince happened, but on the contrary <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> &s;eem'd generally to obtain among the People of God.</P>
<P>Here ob&s;erve the Sophi&s;tical low Art of our Au|thor, in joining Mr. <HI>WHITEFIELD</HI> and me, with tho&s;e whom he calls our Succe&s;&s;ors in their Pro|vinces, that &s;o he might charge upon us the impru|dent Conduct of &s;ome of them; which we dete&s;t.</P>
<P>As to what the <HI>Examiner</HI> adds, re&s;pecting <Q>my feeling the bad Effects of the <HI>Moravian</HI> unchari|table and intru&s;ive Spirit near home, and that that made me complain and flinch.</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer that tho' I have &s;een bad Effects thereof upon &s;ome; yet thro' Mercy I have no Rea&s;on to <HI>flinch</HI> and <HI>complain,</HI> becau&s;e of any bad Effects of it upon the Society which I am related to. For not

one of them has been carry'd away with the Delu&s;i|on entirely that I know of.</P>
<P>I am thro' Grace concious to my &s;elf, what ever our Author has uncharitably and ungenerou&s;ly in|&s;inuated to the Contrary, that no private view has influenced my Zeal again&s;t the <HI>Moravians,</HI> but a &s;incere regard to the Truths and Power of Reli|gion, which they are oppo&s;ing and undermining; neither have any of my Neighbours ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaining of <HI>my rough Hands and heavy Fi&s;ts,</HI> (as you are pleas'd with much Complai&s;ance to word the Matter) in re&s;pect of <HI>Uncharitablene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Intru&s;ion,</HI> as is &s;ugge&s;ted. I have not preach'd in any of their Places without Invitation, or condemned any of them without Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Examiner</HI> next cites my Words from <HI>Mora|vian</HI> Sermon p. 67. which are the&s;e, <Q>Do any e&s;teem the <HI>Moravians</HI> becau&s;e they <HI>travel</HI> and <HI>take great</HI> Pains. I an&s;wer did not the Phari&s;ees of old compa&s;s Sea and Land to make pro&s;elytes and do not <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and many other <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> travel &s;till. But what good do the <HI>Moravians</HI> do by their tra|veling unle&s;s it be good to <HI>&s;ow Tares,</HI> to corrupt and divide religious People.</Q></P>
<P>In the oppo&s;ite Column, we have the following words of the Examiner. <Q>Exactly true; and pray, what good do the <HI>Itinerants</HI> do by their <HI>Traveling,</HI> unle&s;s it be <HI>good to &s;ow Tares,</HI> to corrupt and divide religious People?</Q> After the afore&s;aid Words our Author refers by an <HI>A&s;teri&s;m</HI> to a Charge of our Opponents this Way, in their <HI>Ex|amination,</HI> p. 81. re&s;pecting the pretended dividing Principles and Practices of <HI>Itinerants;</HI> but in a&s;much as nothing is offered to &s;upport the Charge but their Affirmation, I &s;ee no need of any farther reply at pre&s;ent, then what has been before given to the like in the&s;e Sheets.</P>
<P>But I cannot pa&s;s over in Silence, our Authors Judgment concerning the Succe&s;s of <HI>Itinerants,</HI> name|ly, <HI>that it is nothing but &s;owing Tares, corrupting and
<PB N="124" REF="005297_0124_1016F685C276BCC0">
dividing religious People;</HI> as is this as an uncharitable and fal&s;e Charge, &s;o it argues our <HI>Examiner</HI> to be in|con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, for he has el&s;e where ac|knowledged the Contrary, (See p. 9. 21. 30.) as has been ob&s;erv'd before.</P>
<P>The <HI>Examiner</HI> in his 24. p. proceeds to cite from my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon, p. 104. the following Words, <Q>Do not tho&s;e Things together with their &s;end|ing their ignorant Mi&s;&s;ionaries, to gather &s;eparate Societys in Places, where there is a &s;ound Mini|&s;try, &s;ignify that their De&s;ign is not Catholick, whatever their pretences be notwith&s;tanding?</Q> A|gain he borrows from <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon p. 54. the&s;e Words. <Q>Whatever good Appearances thru&s;ting out ignorant Per&s;ons (how <HI>pious</HI> &s;oever) into the Mini&s;try may have, yet it is a dangerous Practice, tending directly to divide and corrupt the Church of God, and bring the Mini&s;try thereof into con|tempt.</Q></P>

<P>I an&s;wer the <HI>Examiners</HI> Charge in the Negative. We have &s;ent no <HI>Ignorant Mi&s;&s;inories</HI> to <HI>gather &s;eparate Societies, where there was a &s;ound Mini&s;try.</HI> The Ca&s;e is truly thus, all that we have <HI>Licens'd</HI> or <HI>Ordain'd</HI> for the <HI>Holy Mini&s;try,</HI> were furni&s;h'd with a competent Mea&s;ure of <HI>human Learning,</HI> agreeable to our Di|rectory. Indeed we have not ordain'd every one to a <HI>fix'd Charge</HI> for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e the Congre|gations that depend upon us for Supplies, are &s;o nu|merous, and our Number of Candidates &s;o &s;mall, that we cannot &s;upply them all at pre&s;ent with a &s;ettled Mini&s;try, as we de&s;ire and intend (God willing) The People, in the mean time, urge us with almo&s;t <HI>in|ce&s;&s;ant</HI> Importunities for &s;ome Supplies, in re&s;pect of Preaching, and likewi&s;e want to have Bapti&s;m ad|mini&s;tred to their Children; and it &s;hould like|wi&s;e be ob&s;erv'd, that tho&s;e Congregations are, many of them, far di&s;tant from each other. Now we knew of no better Method to remedy the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing Exigence, than that of Ordaining &s;ome <HI>ad mi|ni&s;terium vagum,</HI>&mdash;or to preach about in divers Places for a while, and Baptize, until we cou'd get the Places &s;upplyed with a &s;ettled Mini&s;try, or until the Per&s;ons &s;o ordain'd wou'd them&s;elves incline to accept of a fix'd Charge, which Inclination we do not check or Di&s;courage. And I think this Practice of ordaining, as afore&s;aid, has not been without Pre&s;idents in the reformed Churches.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="005297_0126_1016F68ED594DF30">But the Accu&s;ation of <HI>&s;ending any into Places where there is a &s;ound Mini&s;try, to gather &s;eperate Societies,</HI> is a Calumny.

Mr. ROWLAND was neither Licens'd or Ordain'd by us, in <HI>Contempt</HI> of the <HI>Synod,</HI> but in <HI>compliance</HI> with the <HI>Dictates</HI> of our own <HI>Con&s;ciences.</HI> And <HI>We,</HI> who have had him under Ex|amination, did and do look upon him to be &s;uffi|ciently Qualified for the <HI>Go&s;pel Mini&s;try,</HI> both in re|&s;pect of <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Gracious Accompli&s;hments,</HI> agree|able to our <HI>Directory.</HI></P>
<P>As to what is added, of <HI>his beeng thru&s;t into the Bounds of a Neighbouring Presbytery, without their Con|currence, and continu'd there in Oppo&s;ition to, and in con|tempt of their Determination.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> It is a wrong Repre&s;entation of the Matter; he was <HI>Invited</HI> by a Body of Religious Peo|ple, who con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;&s;ented from tho&s;e Acts
<PB N="127" REF="005297_0127_1016F6905C68FAD0">
or Laws, which were made by a Majority of the Synod, which occa&s;ion'd the Debate between us and them, and he him&s;elf likewi&s;e &s;crupl'd the Laws afore&s;aid. In con&s;equence of which the Majority of the Synod had publickly warn'd all the People of their Bounds again&s;t Hearing of Mr. ROWLAND, becau&s;e he had been licens'd by us, notwith&s;tanding of their Cannon.</P>
<P>The People declin'd applying to that <HI>Presbytery</HI> in who&s;e Bounds they were, becau&s;e of the Ca&s;e afore|&s;aid, and other Objections they had again&s;t their Conduct; and not being able to get a Mini&s;ter el&s;e|where, they importuned Mr. ROWLAND to &s;up|ply them, with which he, at la&s;t, comply'd, not out of <HI>Contempt,</HI> but <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> towards God, in order to relieve a <HI>pious, oppos'd</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;s'd</HI> People! which, thro' the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, was to all appearance a Mean of <HI>&s;aving Good</HI> to many precious Souls there, in their <HI>Conviction</HI> and <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> to God.</P>
<P>As to what they &s;ay farther under this Head, viz. <HI>That his Practice hath been to this Day, a cour&s;e of intru|&s;ive Di&s;orders.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer to this Charge <HI>Ignoramus,</HI> we want Proof. To what has been &s;aid, they add, <HI>that his Character has been under a very dull Gloud as to immorality.</HI></P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, that it is an aw|ful &s;ign in our Oppo&s;ers to endeavour to ca&s;t <HI>Contempt</HI> upon the Character of one, who&s;e faithful Labours for God, has been Crown'd with remarkable and di&s;tingui&s;h'd Succe&s;&s;es, and to join with the Prophane in Per&s;ecuting of him. May God forgive their im|piety. But let them know to their &s;hame, that the <HI>dull Cloud which,</HI> they &s;ay, <HI>covered his Character,</HI> is now, by the kind Providence of God, cleared up, and that his <HI>Inocence &s;hines as the Light,</HI> and <HI>his Judg|ment as the Noon-Day!</HI> We wi&s;h with all our Hearts, that all their Candidates were Qualified like him, in re&s;pect of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Learning,</HI> and that they them|&s;elves, <HI>who are &s;o wi&s;e in their own Eyes,</HI> under&s;tood Divinity as well as him, whom they de&s;pi&s;e, or that

all of them together could &s;hew &s;o much Succe&s;s of their Labours.</P>
<P>Who the <HI>Examiner</HI> means in his next Paragraph that <HI>have,</HI> as he &s;ays, <HI>admitted Novices into their Pulpits,</HI> I know not; neither do I know the Names be in|tends by tho&s;e letters of them which he &s;ets down, and therefore I cannot an&s;wer particularly to that Charge; but this I can &s;ay in general, that we have been as careful as we could, to keep <HI>Novices out of our Pulpits,</HI> lea&s;t <HI>contempt &s;hould thereby come on the Mini|&s;try,</HI> and other injuries to the <HI>Chruch of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>And now we are arriv'd at another head of our Authors Performance, p. 26. entitled, <HI>Mr.</HI> T's <HI>Reflecti|ons on the</HI> Practice <HI>of the</HI> Moravians <HI>compar'd with his own</HI> Practice <HI>and that of his</HI> Adherents.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;age he cites from my Writings, is <HI>Appendix,</HI> p. 106. which is this, <Q>Do not &s;ome <HI>Moravians</HI> &s;light human Rea&s;on and Learning? &amp;c. p. 97. Mr. SPANGENBERG declaim'd in my hearing, more than once, again&s;t human learning, &amp;c</Q> In the oppo&s;ite Collumn to which he &s;ays thus. <Q>Hath not Mr. <HI>T.</HI> declaim'd more publickly, and fiercely agin&s;t Learning, then the <HI>Moravians,</HI> when he pronounc'd his <HI>Anathema</HI> again&s;t the <HI>publick Aca|demys,</HI> and pour'd contempt upon a <HI>learned Clergy,</HI> calling them <HI>Letter Learned.</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I have neiter declaim'd publickly nor pri|vately again&s;t <HI>Learning,</HI> but in favour of it. Nor pronounc'd any <HI>Anathema</HI> again&s;t <HI>publick Univer&s;ities.</HI> I only &s;aid <HI>that they are generally corrupt;</HI> I meant in re&s;pect of religious Principles and Practice, and are they not? Can our Author &s;ay the Con|trary? I &s;pake according to the be&s;t Information I had, but &s;hould be glad to find it a mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides I &s;poke of <HI>private School</HI> to be erected, <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> where there were no Publick ones; which manife&s;ts that I had &s;ome regard to them.</P>
<P>And the Method I propos'd to be ob&s;erv'd in <HI>private Schools</HI> re&s;pecting the Examination of <HI>Intrants</HI> as to their Piety, is different from what is ob&s;erv'd
<PB N="129" REF="005297_0129_1016F695E54F9AF0">
in publick ones; and in my Opinion is of noble Tendency to &s;erve the Church of God. For then there wou'd be a greater Probability of the Youths being pre&s;erv'd from the afore&s;aid Corruptions, as well as of their greater advances in Religion by the help of mutual Conver&s;ation, about <HI>experimental Piety.</HI></P>
<P>How incon&s;i&s;tent is our Authors Charge that <HI>I &s;hould declaim again&s;t Learning,</HI> while in the mean Time I propo&s;e amd incourage Schools for that very end; and <HI>more</HI> fiercely <HI>then the</HI> Moravians <HI>too.</HI> O Strange! Well I &s;ee tho' the <HI>Examiner</HI> has no <HI>Charity</HI> for me, or my expre&s;s Declarations; yet he has for the <HI>Moravians</HI> without any in their favour.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> adds, that <HI>I pour'd contempt upon a learned Clergy,</HI> calling them <HI>Letter Learned, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I didn't de&s;ign in the U&s;e of tho&s;e Words our Author mentions, any <HI>contempt</HI> upon the <HI>learning</HI> of Mini&s;ters, but only to &s;ignify my di&s;like at Per|&s;ons coming into the Mini&s;try, that have no other Qualifications but <HI>human Learning.</HI> As the Words of the Sermon to which he refers, con&s;idered in their Connection do manife&s;t. <HI>See</HI> Notingham <HI>Ser|mon, p.</HI> 1. 2. The Sentence runs thus: <Q>Why, had the People then no Teachers, O Yes, they had heaps of <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> Teachers, that came out, no doubt, after they had been the u&s;ual Time at the Feet of <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> and according to the Acts, Cannons and Traditions of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Church.</HI></Q> And is our Author offended with me for that, wou'd he have me to encourage <HI>gracele&s;s</HI> Men tho' <HI>learned,</HI> to come into the Mini&s;try? Let him &s;peak out, that we may hear his Mind upon this important Point. The <HI>Examiner's</HI> next Citation is from <HI>Moravian</HI> Ser|mon. p. 108. the Words are the&s;e. <Q>I think it looks exceeding black in the <HI>Moravians,</HI> to &s;light &s;pe|culative Knowledge, &s;o as they do, which they call Head-Knowledge. Is not &s;peculative Know|ledge the &s;ame for Sub&s;tance with what is &s;av|ing, only de&s;titute of its Influence upon Heart and Practice? <HI>Ibid.</HI> Don't the <HI>Moravians</HI> begin
<PB N="130" REF="005297_0130_1016F697B50A4328">
with the Affections fir&s;t? And is this fair Dealing?</Q></P>
<P>In the oppo&s;ite Column to which the <HI>Examiner</HI> &s;peaks thus, viz. <Q>Why then do we hear &s;o much of the &s;piritual and my&s;tical Sen&s;e of Scripture? &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pray, Has not this been the con&s;tant Practice of the <HI>Itinerants</HI> to addre&s;s and move the Pa&s;&s;ions fir&s;t?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Is not Mr. <HI>T.</HI> the <HI>Primium Mobile,</HI> a principal Mover and Promoter of the Pa&s;&s;ionate-Religion, now prevailing among &s;o many? Is it not as un|fair Dealing in the <HI>Itinerants</HI> as in the Moravians?</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Has our Author heard much or little from, me, of the &s;piritual and my&s;tical Sen&s;e of Scripture, if &s;o let him declare it in his next. It &s;eems by this Pa&s;&s;age that the <HI>Examiner</HI> wou'd repre&s;ent us, as a Tribe of <HI>Allegori&s;ts</HI> and <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tick My&s;ticks;</HI> but we point blank deny the Charge, and demand his Proof. Our Author, as appears by the large Blanks in his Columns, &s;eems to grow faint under the Weight of his <HI>task,</HI> and no wonder indeed. Its pity that a Gen|tleman of his genius &s;hould undertake &s;uch a bad Cau&s;e, as puts him unavoidably to &s;uch difficulties for the want of proper Materials. But I proceed to his Que&s;tion, in an&s;wer to which I can truly &s;ay, that &s;o far as I know, &s;uch as our Author terms <HI>Itinerants,</HI> their Method (in general) has been fir&s;t to inform Mens Judgments, about the mo&s;t impor|tant Points of Religion, and to endeavour to ap|ply them in a clo&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing and pathetical Manner, to the Con&s;ciences and Affections of their hearers, &s;o as to have a Tendency to alarm their Fear and incite their Love.</P>
<P>As to what is farther added again&s;t me in par|ticular, viz. "That I am the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> a principal mover and promoter of the Pa&s;&s;ionate-Re|ligion, now prevailing among &s;o many.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Ob&s;erve Reader, the <HI>Examiner</HI> acknow|ledges than an affectionate Religion, now prevails
<PB N="131" REF="005297_0131_1016F69CDC97D300">
among many; well here is another Te&s;timony from his own Pen in favour of the late Reformation. In the mean Time I utterly di&s;claim what he a&s;|cribes to me in the&s;e Words, <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> or <HI>fir&s;t mover.</HI> This is an honour which belongs to no meer Man. I am fully per&s;waded upon the mo&s;t certain Foundation, that it is the holy Spirit of God, who was the <HI>fir&s;t Mover</HI> of what he calls the <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate Religion;</HI> and this the Effects thereof, in the Change that has been wrought upon the Govern|ing Tempers of the Minds and general Cour&s;e of the Lives of Multitudes, do inconte&s;tibly prove, to all that are not blinded with unaccountable pre|judice. Can it with any &s;hadow of Rea&s;on be &s;up|po&s;ed that Satan wou'd &s;o far fight again&s;t his own Intere&s;t, as to rou&s;e Multitudes of Sinners out of the Sleep of &s;inful Security, and excite them to im|portunate Enquiries, and ince&s;&s;ant Importunities af|ter Salvation by JESUS CHRIST? And that he would, if he could, change mens Minds and Practice as before ob&s;erv'd. No &s;urely! by the &s;ame Method of caviling, by which &s;ome Labour to condemn the late revival of Religion in this Land, they may condemn that Work of God which was in the Apo&s;tolick Age.&mdash;</P>
<P>But if our Author means no more, than that I have been a <HI>principal Promoter</HI> under God, of the <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate Religion,</HI> he does me much honour, tho' pro|bably not with de&s;ign. I have been indeed endea|vouring to promote a Religion which includes both <HI>Judgment, Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> in it. And ble&s;&s;ed be God he has given Succe&s;s to my attempts. <HI>Pa&s;|&s;ion</HI> without <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> in Religion, is certainly but vain Fancy, and <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Judg|ment</HI> without &s;ome degree of Pa&s;&s;ion, is but dead dry <HI>Formality.</HI> My own Con&s;cience and multitudes of Mankind can witne&s;s for me, that it has been always my endeavour in the Cour&s;e of my Mini&s;try fir&s;t to inform Mens minds before I addre&s;s'd their <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> which I cannot but think
<PB N="132" REF="005297_0132_1016F69F98EAE800">
is the only proper Method of dealing with intel|ligent Creatures. Certainly <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> is of no farther u&s;e in Religion, then it is under the Guidance of a well inform'd Judgment, but thus far it is of ex|cellent u&s;e. It is ab&s;ur'd to &s;uppo&s;e that God has given us <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> to be only employ'd about terrene trifles.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to the 27 p. where our Au|thor quotes the following Words from my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon. <Q>Do they not endeavour to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into Peoples Affections fir&s;t, by Smiles &amp;c. And in p. 65. Do any e&s;teem the <HI>Moravian</HI> Sect, becau&s;e they &s;mile generally and appear loving; but Brethren is not this <HI>Judas</HI> like to betray us with a ki&s;s; for while they &s;hew &s;uch Love, they draw pious People into Errors, and &s;o &s;et them a quarelling with one another, &s;hall we &s;uffer them to &s;mile us out of our Principles, then I'm &s;ure we are poorly grounded in them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ibid.</HI> <Q>Do not they take &s;pecial care to apply to young Per&s;ons, Females and Ignorant People who are full of Affection?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Who do they imitate in attacking the weaker Part of Man, viz. the Pa&s;&s;ions, and the weaker Sex fir&s;t, but the Devil, the Father of Lies and Er|rors? Did not he deal thus with our fir&s;t Parents, and by the weaker Sex &s;educed <HI>Adam?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon the oppo&s;ite Column we have the&s;e Words of our <HI>Examiner,</HI> viz. <Q>Who can help &s;miling at this, that con&s;iders what is pa&s;t and now is.&mdash; Strange that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;hould complain of the <HI>Mora|vian</HI> Smiles in religious Matter! When it is no|torious, that he him&s;elf not only &s;mil'd but laugh'd heartily over his Converts, even while they were under a preparatory Work of the Law, and his followers have practi&s;ed upon him, and not been a&s;ham'd to expre&s;s their Joy at,&mdash;by loud laugh|ing even in the Solemn A&s;&s;emblies. Is not this <HI>ludere cum Sacris,?</HI> an unju&s;tifiable Practice in one as well as another.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="005297_0133_1016F6A293DE9BE0"><Q>And is not this Practice exactly corre&s;pondent with the Practice of Mr. <HI>T.</HI> and other heady <HI>Itine|rants,</HI> which <HI>creep into Hou&s;es and have had mo&s;t Succe&s;s among Females and young ignorant People.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The whole Pa&s;&s;age is &s;o very applicable to <HI>Iti|nerants</HI> in general, That I &s;hould have taken it for a Repre&s;entation, (not to &s;ay Refutation of their Conduct) if Mr. <HI>T.</HI> had not taught me to apply it to the <HI>Moravians.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Here let the Reader ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Ex|aminer</HI> mi&s;repre&s;ents my meaning, and has left out a pretty deal that &s;erves to explain it; he &s;ays, <HI>I com|plain of the</HI> Moravian <HI>Smiles in religious Matters:</HI> But this is a fal&s;e Charge, it is only their abu&s;e of them that I complain of, and not the meer U&s;e of them in religious Matters; namely, their trying to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into Peoples Affection by them, thro' &s;hews of Love, and &s;o to draw them into Error, while in the mean Time they conceal their Princi|ples, until the Affections are fixed.</P>
<P>If the Heart is fill'd with Love and Joy, it will naturally make the face Serene. And have I &s;mil'd and laugh'd heratily over my Converts, (or People wro't upon by my Mini&s;try) while under a prepa|ratory Work of the Law: Well, and where is the Harm of it, it &s;hew'd that I was glad that poor &s;in|&s;iers were in a likely way to come to Chri&s;t: And wou'd our Author have me to be &s;orry upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion? God forbid! I wou'd rather immitate the Example of our Lord, who <HI>tho' a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief,</HI> yet <HI>rejoyc'd in Spirit</HI> at &s;uch an event, viz. <HI>When Satan fell as Lightning from Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>And here let it be noticed, by the by, that I am Honoured with another Te&s;timony from our <HI>Examiner,</HI> to the Succe&s;s of my Mini&s;try, for it &s;eems, even according to his own acknowledgment, <HI>that &s;ome were brought under a Work of the Law by my Labours.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>laughing loud in Religious A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> if any have been guilty of it, I will not undertake to be their Patron, in that I think it is <HI>undecent</HI> and of <HI>bad Re|port.</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="005297_0134_1016F6A554022588">
But to &s;hew the <HI>Examiner's</HI> unfair dealing un-this Head of Charge, I will cite the whole Para|graph he refers to, <HI>See Moravian Sermon page</HI> 106. the Words are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Don't the <HI>Moravians</HI> be|gin with the Affections fir&s;t? and is this fair Deal|ing? Do they not endeavour to in&s;inuate them|&s;elves into Peoples Affections fir&s;t, by Smiles and &s;oft Di&s;cour&s;es about the Love of CHRIST, and by a &s;eemingly innocent, &s;imple and loving Behaviour, while in the mean Time they care|fully hide their Principles until the Affections are catch'd, and then let them out by Degrees? Should not they &s;how their Principles fir&s;t, before the Affections are fix'd, that &s;o People might judge of them with calmne&s;s and impartiality?</Q></P>
<P>As to the next particular of Charge, viz. <HI>Creeping into Hou&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. I an&s;wer that his Application is <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>untrue:</HI> Neither I nor any of my Brethren <HI>have crept into Hou&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. In&s;tead of <HI>&s;culking</HI> and <HI>un|derhand</HI> Methods, we have declar'd our religious Sen|timents freely on all proper Occa&s;ions, and in the opene&s;t Manner po&s;&s;ible, before the greate&s;t con|cour&s;es of <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>unlearned</HI> Men that ever <HI>Ame|rica</HI> has &s;een of a Religious kind.</P>
<P>Neither has our Succe&s;s, thro divine Grace, been confined to <HI>Females and young ignorant People,</HI> but has extended to Per&s;ons of almo&s;t every age, order and condition of Life, learned and unlearned, rich and poor, old and young, honourable and ignoble, male and female, tho' in the mean time we look upon the Conver&s;ion of <HI>Females and ignorant Per&s;ons,</HI> to be a Matter of infinite Importance, and do glo|rify God upon the Account thereof.</P>
<P>And here let the Reader ob&s;erve another Te&s;ti|mony to our Succe&s;s from the Pen of an Oppo&s;er, and that even when he is trying to run us and it down, and that expre&s;ly contrary to what he has &s;aid page 24. in the&s;e Words, <HI>And pray what good do the</HI>

<P>But we proceed to his 28 pag. where he quotes the following Words from my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon, p. 107. <Q>And don't they refu&s;e generally to rea&s;on upon Points in Religion, whereby one might con|vince another, and leave People to be pro&s;elyted by &s;ight only! It is politick in them indeed to wave Rea&s;oning and to &s;hun Di&s;covery, for their Principles will bear neither.</Q></P>
<P>In the oppo&s;ite Column the <HI>Examiner</HI> &s;peaks thus, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>This Rev. Gentleman had forgot &s;urely the <HI>Motto</HI> of his own Party, viz. <HI>An&s;wer him not a Word,</HI> when he whote this, it is thought by &s;ome that <HI>their Strength</HI> was herein.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I can't be &s;aid to forget that which I never knew. The controver&s;al Writings that &s;ome of us have make publick, do declare to the World, that what has been now &s;aid is not our <HI>Motto,</HI> and I hope the&s;e Sheets will convince the <HI>Examiner</HI> that it is not mine.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems indeed that our Author was of Opi|nion, that <HI>An&s;wer him not a Word,</HI> was our <HI>Motto,</HI> otherwi&s;e how could he run &s;uch Lengths as he has done in his Performance.</P>
<P>The next Pa&s;&s;age that the <HI>Examiner</HI> quotes from my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon is p. 65. the Words are the&s;e, <Q>My Soul is greived to &s;ee the childi&s;h Ficklene&s;s of the Sons and Daughters of this Generation, who are to&s;s'd about with every Wind of Doc|trine; who are &s;mil'd out of their Religion, without being able to offer one &s;olid Rea&s;on for their Change.</Q></P>

<P>Pray does the <HI>Examiner</HI> mean by <HI>Strange Doctrines</HI> the <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> namely of <HI>original Sin, Ju&s;tifi|cation by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t alone,</HI> the <HI>New-Birth,</HI> the <HI>Per&s;everance of the Saints,</HI> are the&s;e <HI>Strange</HI> to him?

Now the&s;e are the Doctrines that our&s;elves and hearers have been chiefly affected with, and influenced by. And is the <HI>Examiner</HI> &s;orry for that, then he him&s;elf is an object of Pitty, and &s;o are tho&s;e whom he calls <HI>judicious and &s;erious Chri&s;tians,</HI> if they join with him therein.</P>
<P>As to the Accu&s;ation <HI>of having Mens Per&s;ons in Ad|miration,</HI> I hope I may &s;ay in behalf of my &s;elf and Brethren, that the chief Rea&s;ons why we admire Per&s;ons are their Goodne&s;s and U&s;efulne&s;s to the Church of God, and that it is our de&s;ire and endea|vour in the general, to proportion our e&s;teem to the Degrees thereof. As to the Charge of <HI>Separation</HI> it has been before an&s;wered.</P>
<P>But our <HI>Examiner</HI> in the mean Time &s;eems to be realy guilty of what he without Foundation char|ges upon us, in as much as by this Performance he &s;eems to admire tho&s;e, who oppo&s;e the Power of Religion this Way, and who hold, &s;ome of them, the&s;e Strange Doctrines, viz. <HI>That Conviction is not nece&s;&s;ary to Conver&s;ion.</HI> That <HI>there is no inward call to the Mini&s;try,</HI> and the Notion of the <HI>rigid Independants</HI>

and <HI>Browni&s;ts,</HI> re&s;pecting the Peoples Relation to their Pa&s;tor, <HI>viz. that it is equal to that of a Marriage Con|tract:</HI> And who have &s;eparated them&s;elves.&mdash;And thus our Author appears to be guilty <HI>of admiring of Per&s;ons</HI> in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e.&mdash;The next Pa&s;&s;age our Au|thor quotes from <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon, is p. 58. <Q>Children are fond of new Things, that look bright tho' of little Value: Thus Novices in Chri&s;tia|nity who are ju&s;t beginning the Chri&s;tian Cour&s;e, ignorant in a great Mea&s;ure, as to Chri&s;tian Principles, but full of Affection and &s;elf Con|ceit, when a <HI>Moravian</HI> comes among them, &s;itts down a while, and look very Harmle&s;s, Innocent and Sober, gives &s;ome &s;miles, and talks about the Blood of Chri&s;t, in their My&s;tical Way, and of Love, Love. O brave, O what a fine Man is this!</Q></P>
<P>In the oppo&s;ite Column we have the&s;e Words of the <HI>Examiner,</HI> viz. <Q>It is a moving Argument, and Proof that People are not &s;o well taught in this Land as is pretended, but have now as much need as ever to have their Minds in&s;tructed as well as their Pa&s;&s;ions mov'd.&mdash;The Image is very Strong and lively.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The <HI>Examiners</HI> applying to us, the <HI>Mora|vians</HI> My&s;tical Way of talking about the Blood of Chri&s;t, is &s;o fal&s;e and trifling that it de&s;erves no An|&s;wer: Our Author was exceedingly &s;traitned here, for the want of Matter, and well he might if he has any remains of Con&s;cience in him.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Examiner</HI> proceeds to quote a Paragraph from my <HI>Moravian</HI> Sermon p. 107. which runs thus. <Q>Certainly we &s;hould adhere inviolably to the Prin|ciples we have been in&s;tructed in, until we find better, which we &s;hould be always ready to re|ceive upon proper <HI>Conviction,</HI> which is not to be attain'd by a &s;ight of the Grimaces of Strangers or by immediate Revelations or Enthu&s;ia&s;ms, but by Scripture, Rea&s;on and Argument.</Q> And p. 52. I direct to hold fa&s;t CHRIST'S precious Truth, thus. <Q>It is needful to wave a po&s;itive Conclu&s;ion re&s;pecting the Good State of Strangers, when we
<PB N="138" REF="005297_0138_1016F6B06B982030">
have not &s;ufficient Evidences for it in re&s;pect of their Principles, Experiences and Practice. <HI>Ra&s;h judging</HI> either Way is certainly unrea&s;onable and prejudicial, when Per&s;ons do &s;peedily with|out &s;ufficient Rea&s;on, conclude Strangers who come among them to be Pious and perhaps emi|nently &s;o, becau&s;e of their fair Appearances in Behaviour, without examining their Principles; by this ra&s;h Method of proceeding their Affecti|ons are apt to be unrea&s;onably engag'd in their Favour, and the&s;e being inflam'd do give a &s;ecret wrong By a&s;s to their Judgment, and thus they lay them&s;elves open to all Manner of Delu&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>After which the <HI>Examiner</HI> ob&s;erves as follows, viz. <Q>I am confident the impartial Reader is fully con|vinced by this time, that Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> has drawn his own Picture to the Life, by the Repre&s;enta|tion he has given of the Principles and Practices of the <HI>Moravians,</HI> and that I have only &s;et the Mirror in &s;uch a Po&s;ition that He and his Adhe|rents may &s;ee them&s;elves, and be a&s;hamed. But if they are blinded with Self-love, Admiration, Conceit, Party-Zeal, and the like, and will not, or cannot &s;ee their own Likene&s;s; I believe o|thers have &s;o much of a Spirit of di&s;cerning, as to &s;ee that M. <HI>T&mdash;t</HI> and his Partizans as nearly re&s;emble the Character here given of the <HI>Moravians, as one Crow's Egg does another</HI> (to u&s;e his own homely Compari&s;on.)</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> If the Reader had no other Repre&s;entation of the Ca&s;e, then that <HI>Partial</HI> one which the <HI>Exa|miner</HI> has given in his Performance, he might proba|bly be enduced to think hard of me, and that I was incon&s;i&s;tent with my &s;elf; for tho' there be little re|gard to <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Candor</HI> in our Authors Compo&s;ure, yet &s;everal Stroaks in it are manag'd with much Art and apparent Plau&s;ibility. I cannot but think that the <HI>Examiner</HI> is a Gentlemen of Wit and Addre&s;s, otherwi&s;e he cou'd not have manag'd &s;o well &s;o bad a Cau&s;e as he has done, but 'tis Pitty his Talents are

not turned into another Channel, that might better &s;erve the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> as well as his own Reputation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mirror</HI> our Author has &s;et before the Rea|der, is but &s;ome broken Pieces &s;et in a wrong Situa|tion, which &s;erve only to deceive the Mind with fal&s;e Images of Per&s;ons and Things.</P>
<P>It is true <HI>I am a&s;ham'd,</HI> when I read his Perfor|mance, but not for my Self but him. On the con|trary I think I am honour'd, when traduced for the Sake of Truth and Piety.</P>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion of the afore&s;aid Paragraph is as <HI>fal&s;e</HI> as ever any thing was <HI>true,</HI> namely, <HI>That I and my Partizans</HI> (as he is pleas'd to term my dear and reverend Brethren) <HI>as neerly re&s;emble the Character here given of the</HI> Moravians, <HI>as one Crow's Egg does a|nother.</HI> If the whole Paragraph be con&s;idered, it will appear that in this Sentence the <HI>Examiner</HI> has a Ref|ference, to all that he had cited from my Sermons re&s;pecting the <HI>Moravians.</HI> Here ob&s;erve this Gen|tleman is Po&s;itive that the Similitude is as exact as any Thing can be, but under the particular Heads of Charge in &s;everal of his Columns, the judicious Reader may perceive, that &s;ometimes he varies in the Application, leaves out &s;ome things altogether, and alters others to &s;uit his De&s;ign; and in &s;ome Places he is Indi&s;tinct and General and &s;peaks but a very little, leaving large Blanks (and perhaps it would have been more to his Credit if it had been all a Blank.) How incon&s;i&s;tent are the&s;e Things?</P>
<P>He &s;ays <HI>if we are &s;o blinded, &amp;c.</HI> that <HI>we will not or cannot &s;ee our own Likene&s;s.</HI> He believes <HI>others have &s;o much of a Spirit of di&s;cerning, as to &s;ee the Re&s;emblance is as exact as that of one Crow's Egg to another.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> A true Spirit of di&s;cerning will perceive as much Difference between the two, (if I may be allowed to u&s;e another homely Simile) as between an <HI>Apple</HI> and an <HI>Oy&s;ter,</HI> or rather as between <HI>black</HI> and <HI>white.</HI> To apprehend as he does, requires not right <HI>di&s;cerning</HI> or true <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing,</HI> but a Perver&s;ion

of the Sight, either thro' a defect of the optick Or|gans, or by this fal&s;e <HI>Mirror</HI> he pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>However if the <HI>Examiner</HI> will not be offended, I will beg leave to u&s;e the homely Words, be com|plains of, once more in the following Manner, viz. <HI>That I am apt to think that by this Time the impartial Reader may perceive as great a re&s;emblance between the</HI> Examiner <HI>and the</HI> Oppo&s;ers of God's Work <HI>here, in divers Particulars,</HI> as between one Crow's Egg and another.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to con&s;ider the next Paragraph in his 30th. p. which runs thus. <Q>The Reader may take this Examination as an Help to di&s;cover <HI>what is Truth</HI> in the <HI>late Religious Commotion</HI> in this Country, and he will find it to be ju&s;t that which the <HI>Oppo&s;ers,</HI> &s;o called, are zealous to maintain, <HI>viz.</HI> the Order of the Go&s;pel, and the &s;acred Honours due to the holy Spirit of God. Strip <HI>this Work</HI> of its <HI>Extraordinaries,</HI> and you will di&s;cern what is <HI>the Work of God,</HI> from that which is added to it <HI>by Art</HI> and <HI>Man's Device.</HI> Pray what is there Extraordinary on one &s;ide more than t'other, but what is ju&s;tly to be exploded, <HI>viz.</HI> extraordinary Errors, Di&s;orders, Intru&s;ions, ra&s;h Cen&s;ures, Clamorous Exclamations, vain-glorious Boa&s;tings, Fits, Pretence of Sights and Vi&s;ions, Roarings, Tremblings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Compare Mr. <HI>T</HI>&mdash; with him&s;elf, and &s;have off his Extraordinaries (turning the Edge of his own Weapon on him|&s;elf) and <HI>his Strength will go from him, and he will be like any other Man; a Man &s;ubject to like Pa&s;&s;ions as we are.</HI> I can't find but that the <HI>New-Brun&s;wick Party</HI> are fallible as other Men, and chargeable with as many Errors, Intru&s;i|ons, Contradictions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as their Neighbours, whom they are ready to condemn as <HI>Enemies of God's Work</HI> and <HI>Enemies of Religion</HI> meerly for op|po&s;ing their Errors and real Indi&s;cretions: Whereas the true Intere&s;t of Religion is doubt|le&s;s &s;erv'd by &s;uch Oppo&s;ition.</Q></P>

<P><Q>The <HI>Moravians</HI> it &s;eems treated Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> in the &s;ame uncharitable, cen&s;orious, imperious, di|vi&s;ive Manner in which he him&s;elf has treated the <HI>Body of the Clergy of this Generation,</HI> and then the Spirit appears to him in a mo&s;t frightful Shape, and mu&s;t be avoided. <HI>Now it is come upon thee, thou fainte&s;t: And it toucheth thee, and thou art trou|bled.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In An&s;wer to what has been &s;aid, let me brief|ly ob&s;erve, that if any Body wants to entertain prejudice again&s;t the late glorious revival of Religion in this Land, or an unju&s;t Notion of the greatne&s;s of it, the <HI>Examiner</HI>'s Performance may be &s;ome help that Way in re&s;pect of &s;ome Stroaks that are in it.</P>
<P>However it &s;hould be remark'd for the Honour of <HI>the late revival of Piety,</HI> that while our Author is indu&s;triou&s;ly painting it in a Sable dre&s;s, he is con&s;train'd to confe&s;s in this Paragraph that there was &s;ome <HI>reality in it,</HI> which he terms the <HI>Order of the Go&s;pel and the &s;acred Honours due to the holy Spirit of God.</HI></P>
<P>And while the <HI>Examiner</HI> propo&s;es this Que&s;tion viz, <HI>What is extraordinary upon one &s;ide more than ano|ther?</HI> He hereby allows an equality of Succe&s;s in preaching as to Succe&s;s, between the <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Op|po&s;ers</HI> of the late Reformation of Religion, then by an unavoidable con&s;equence, our Author mu&s;t either deny that they had any Succe&s;s at all, (which I &s;up|po&s;e he wou'd be loth to do) or acknowledge ours, I &s;ee not how he can get clear of this Dilemma.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="005297_0142_1016F6BD8C1166B8">But in the mean Time while he owns &s;ome reali|ty in it he puts a bear Skin over it, and talks of &s;omething added to it by <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Man's Devi&s;e,</HI> and then repeats his thread bare Catalogue of frightful Things, <HI>extraordinary Errors, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> which has been before con&s;idered.

<P>If the <HI>Oppo&s;ers</HI> had been Zealous to maintain the honours of <HI>the holy Spirit</HI> there wou'd be no Debate &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among us re&s;pecting the <HI>late Reformation.</HI> But pray why does the <HI>Examiner</HI> put the <HI>Order of the Go&s;pel</HI> (&s;o call'd) before <HI>the &s;acred Honours due to the holy Spirit.</HI> By this unrea&s;onable Precedence it &s;eems that our Author perferrs <HI>Externals</HI> before <HI>the Life of Piety,</HI> which is &s;inful and Scandalous: But becau&s;e the <HI>Examiner</HI> and his Brethen talk <HI>of Order (u&s;que ad|ravim)</HI> &s;o much, I will beg Leave to cite a Pa&s;&s;age upon this Head, from the Works of excellent and judicious Mr. FLAVEL, in his <HI>Husbandry &s;pirituliz'd</HI> Volum 2. p. 307. of the 4th Edition, <HI>upon an excel|lent but irregular Tree.</HI> <Q>Seeing a Tree grow &s;omewhat Irregular in a very neat Orchard, I told the Owner it was Pitty that Tree &s;hould &s;tand there, and that if it were mine I would root it up, and thereby reduce the Orchard to exact uniformity.

This Tree, &s;aid he, which you wou'd root up hath yielded me more Fruit then many of tho&s;e Trees, which have nothing el&s;e to commend them but their regular Situation. I could not but

<P>As to that of <HI>turning the Edge of my Weapon upon my &s;elf,</HI> the <HI>Examiner</HI> has try'd artfully and indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly the Method he propo&s;es, but I am not &s;en|&s;ible that the Effect he mentions has been the I&s;&s;ue of it, <HI>viz. That my Strength is gone from me.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>New-Brun&s;wick Party</HI> (as he calls them) have never pretended to infallibility,&mdash;and as to his Charge of <HI>Errors and intru&s;ions, &amp;c.</HI> it has been be|fore con&s;idered.

<P>I can with integrity of Heart a&s;&s;ure our Author that <HI>I do not cry out of Danger,</HI> on the Account of any Treatment I have received of the <HI>Moravians,</HI> but becau&s;e of the Hurt they are doing to the Church of God.

<P>What wou'd they have me do, &s;hould I &s;peak well of gracele&s;s Mini&s;ters, when &s;ome of them e&s;pecially, are the Bane of Religion, the Pe&s;t of the Church, and Burden of the Creation? In this I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed.</P>
