<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>UNWILLING to incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of every friend to ju&s;tice, religion, and humanity, I ha&s;ten to inform the Reader, who has ca&s;t an eye on the Title-Page, that, in attempting to e&s;tabli&s;h the licitne&s;s of the SLAVE-TRADE, nothing is farther re|moved from my thoughts, than to &s;et up as an advo|cate for inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion: I am as much at enmity with both, as the mo&s;t &s;anguine advocate for African Liberty may be. I am well apprized, that acts of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion, however authorized by numbers, however firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed by long u&s;e, and a kind of traditional attention to the &s;ufferings of per&s;ons in an abject condition of life, can never change the criminality of their nature. Whatever is e&s;&s;entially incompatible with the &s;acred and inalie|nable rights of ju&s;tice and humanity, can claim no place in the catalogue of virtues, even of the lowe&s;t rank; it mu&s;t be forever branded with every mark of infamy and guilt.</P>
<P>FAR then from attempting the lea&s;t encroachment on the rights of Virtue, my &s;ole drift in the pre&s;ent Tract is to examine with the utmo&s;t impartiality, the intrin&s;ic nature of the SLAVE-TRADE: that is, whether the Trade it&s;elf pre&s;cinding from every other inci|dental circum&s;tance, which may have rendered the practice of it hateful, or even criminal, be in its own nature licit or illicit.</P>
<P>Now, it being evident in the fir&s;t place, that the intrin&s;ic morality or immorality, licitne&s;s or illicitne&s;s of all human pur&s;uits is e&s;&s;entially inherent to the
<PB N="vi" REF="022555_0004_0FB945B26637C488">pur&s;uits them&s;elves, and not at all depending on our habits or ideas of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong,</HI> which are but too often influenced and darkened by prejudice, intere&s;t, and other pa&s;&s;ions; and, it being equally evident on the other hand, that the declarations of the Written Word of God are &s;o many ineontrovertible deci&s;ions, by which we are to judge of the intrin&s;ic licitne&s;s or illicitne&s;s of &s;uch facts as are regi&s;tered in the Sacred Volumes; it follows nece&s;&s;arily, that, one of tho&s;e facts being undoubtedly the SLAVE-TRADE, no argu|ments can be &s;o forcible and conclu&s;ive, towards evin|cing the inherent lawfulne&s;s of it, as tho&s;e Oracular deci&s;ions of the Word of God, which give a po&s;&s;itive &s;anction to the Trade it&s;elf.&mdash;It is then by enforcing the&s;e unerring deci&s;ions only, the &s;ure&s;t guide to direct our judgments in forming a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the merits of the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y, that I mean to vindicate the licitne&s;s of the SLAVE-TRADE; not by patronizing &s;uch crying enormities and abu&s;es, as are &s;aid to be perpetrated in this mo&s;t ancient commercial pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>SHOULD the &s;anction of divine authority appear evident in favour of the SLAVE-TRADE, from the te&s;timonies I &s;hall produce in the &s;eries of my Re&s;earches, I &s;hall con&s;ider my&s;elf perfectly di&s;inga|ged from the mo&s;t di&s;tant obligation of an&s;wering &s;uch objections, as are not grounded on the &s;ame divine authority: an authority of that irre&s;i&s;tible weight of conviction, that every per&s;on, who has any preten&s;ions to Religion, mu&s;t immediately a&s;|&s;ent to, however plau&s;able or ingenious the oppo|&s;ite arguments may appear, when viewed through the &s;canty light of mere human rea&s;on and &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>THE &s;cope of the following Re&s;earches being evi|dently to try the merits of the pre&s;ent Controver|&s;y by the Sacred Canons of the Written Word of
<PB N="vii" REF="022555_0005_0FB945B5D537C728">God, I can expect conviction only from &s;uch per|&s;ons, as are not &s;o far de&s;titute of every &s;entiment of Religion and good &s;en&s;e, as to di&s;believe the di|vine authenticity of tho&s;e Sacred Writings, in which the Finger of God has left in indelible characters the vi&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion of his Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Now, as the&s;e Sacred Records contain tran&s;ac|tions relative to the SLAVE-TRADE, as practi&s;ed in all the three religious Di&s;pen&s;ations that have appear|ed in the World &s;ince the formation of the fir&s;t of men to the pre&s;ent time, I &s;hall, accordingly, di|vide my Scriptural Re&s;earches on that Trade, into three &s;eparate Parts: in which I &s;hall &s;ucce&s;&s;ively prove, that the SLAVE-TRADE is perfectly con&s;o|nant to the principles of the Law of Nature, the Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen&s;ation, and the Chri&s;tian Law, as de|lineated to us in the Sacred Writings of the Word of God.</P>
<P>I HAVE prefixed to the whole a few po&s;itions or <HI>Data,</HI> which I tru&s;t, will be &s;ound unque&s;tonably true, and exactly conformable to &s;ound rea&s;on; in order, that I may not be interrupted in the &s;equel with unnece&s;&s;ary repititions of general principles, nor be in the lea&s;t con&s;trained to enter into a formal con|futation of arguments which do not immediately affect my &s;ubject, and that the Reader may &s;ee at one view the very fundamental principles of tho&s;e inferences, which I draw in vindication of the SLAVE-TRADE from the Scriptural pa&s;&s;ages I have &s;elected in the cour&s;e of my Re&s;earches, out of a greater num|ber of the &s;ame import I could ea&s;ily produce.</P>
<P>THE Scriptural pa&s;&s;ages are literally tran&s;cribed from the Prote&s;tant Vulgar Tran&s;lation of the Bible; which, being the mo&s;t generally received in the&s;e Kingdoms, will, of cour&s;e, have a greater weight of authority than any other with the major part of my
<PB N="viii" REF="022555_0006_0FB945B6A2531C00">Readers. The Edition I u&s;e is that which was pub|li&s;hed in London by John Bill and Chri&s;topher Barker in the year 1669.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to compo&s;ition, I can pretend to nei|ther elegance nor &s;tyle: a Foreigner, unacquainted with the lea&s;t element of the Engli&s;h Language till the twenty-&s;eventh year of his age, can have no claim to either: if he can but arrange his periods with a tolera|ble degree of grammatical accuracy, and expre&s;s him|&s;elf with &s;ufficient clearne&s;s, method, and per&s;picuity, he has rea&s;on to expect every indulgence from the na|tive candour of an Engli&s;h Critic.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>Scriptural Re&s;earches on the licitne&s;s of the Slave-Trade, &s;hewing its conformity with the principles of the Law of Nature delineated in the</HI> Sacred Writings.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THAT period of years, which elap&s;ed from the day on which <HI>God created Man in bis own image</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is, c. 1.5.27.</NOTE>, to the day on which He gave his Laws to the Children of I&s;rael on Mount Sinai<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Exodus, c. 29. &amp;c.</NOTE>, is generally called the period of the Law of Nature. The exact duration of this period is a matter of controvercy among the Learned. Archbi&s;hop U&s;her, who&s;e chronological accuracy in the computation of &s;criptural years is much admired, reckons 2513 years between the Creation of the World and the promulgation of the Mo&s;aic Law. But be this as it may (for no differ|ence in computation can affect the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent Re&s;earches), it is evident from the tenour of the Sacred Records, that, between the creation of Adam and the promulgation of the Mo&s;aic Law, the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Law of Nature, commonly called Natural Religion, or the Religion of Nature, was the only true Religion in the World.</P>
<P N="2">II. SIMPLE as the principles of this Religion may appear, directed chiefly to wor&s;hip One, Supreme, Eternal, Being, the Creator and Governor of all things, and to chu&s;e and act in exact conformity to the inward dictates of &s;ound and unbia&s;&s;ed rea&s;on in every tran&s;|action of life, where Right and Wrong were le&s;t to the choice of man; it would be exceedingly difficult, as well as perfectly extraneous to my pre&s;ent &s;ubject, to dige&s;t tho&s;e principles into a regular Code of tho&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="022555_0011_0FB945C1DF17F9E8">particular laws and duties, which con&s;tituted the whole &s;y&s;tem of that Religion. I have not engaged to di&s;|play the whole frame and &s;tructure of Natural Religion. I am to &s;hew no farther, than that the principle laws of that <HI>Religion,</HI> as far as we find them delineated in the <HI>&s;acred writings,</HI> not only never forbade the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> or hinted the mo&s;t di&s;tant oppo&s;ition to the pro&s;ecution of it; but that, the &s;ame being frequently exempli&s;ied in the con&s;tant and uninterrupted practice of &s;ome of the mo&s;t faithful ob&s;ervers of the laws and principles of that <HI>Religion,</HI> under the <HI>vi&s;ible protection of God,</HI> who&s;e favourites they were, the laws and principles them&s;elves were in perfect harmony with the practice of the <HI>Slave-Trade.</HI> Two very &s;ingular in&s;tances of this kind, verified in the conduct of two of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Characters within the above period of the Law or Nature, <HI>Abrabam</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> will, I flatter my&s;elf, be &s;ufficient, without mentioning others, to ju&s;tify my a&s;&s;ertion, and &s;et the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y in the cleare&s;t light of Scriptural convic|tion.</P>

<P N="5">V. NOR is his unimpeachable character, as a right|eous man, le&s;s con&s;picuous in the Writings of the New Te&s;tament; where, among many other te&s;timo|nies of his irreproachable life, the Son of God him&s;elf, who always &s;peaks of him as one of the mo&s;t faithful &s;ervants of his Eternal Father, rebukes the Jews for having &s;o far departed from the rectitude of Abraham's conduct, as not to be entitled to the appellation of his Children; for, <HI>If ye were Abraham's children,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ye would do the works of Abraham</HI><NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">John, 8.39.</NOTE></P>
<P N="6">VI. Now, it is very remarkable, that among the <HI>works</HI> of Abraham, the very faithful, obedient, hu|mane, ju&s;t, di&s;intere&s;ted, righteous, and virtuous Abraham, who con&s;tantly obeyed the voice of God, kept his charge, his commandments, his &s;tatutes, and
<PB N="15" REF="022555_0013_0FB945C4E6084460">his laws, and found &s;uch acceptance with him, as to be admitted to the familiarity of his friendly inter|cour&s;e; it is very remarkable, I &s;ay, that there &s;hould be found among his <HI>works</HI> the practice of dealing in human fle&s;h, the practice of purcha&s;ing with money tho&s;e of his own &s;pecies, and making them <HI>Bond|Slaves</HI><NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 17, 23.27.</NOTE>, without the lea&s;t intimation being ever given by any of the in&s;pired Writers, that his con|duct in this particular, where the natural rights of ju&s;tice and humanity are &s;aid to be &s;o e&s;&s;entially inte|re&s;ted, was ever reproved, or even di&s;countenanced in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner by any private or public intimation of God's di&s;plea&s;ure!</P>
<P N="7">VII. AND what can we rea&s;onably conclude from this uniform &s;ilence of the in&s;pired Writers? but that the practice of purcha&s;ing &s;laves was never accounted in the &s;ight of God a violation of any of the laws of the Religion of Nature. For, is it credible, or, rather is it po&s;&s;ible for any one to believe, con&s;i&s;tently with the ideas we ought to entertain of the infinite holine&s;s of God, in whom dwelleth e&s;&s;entially the fulne&s;s of ju&s;tice, that he would &s;tyle him&s;elf <HI>The God of Abra|ham,</HI> in preference to any other; that he would vouch|&s;afe to honour him with the appellation of <HI>His Friend;</HI> that he would ble&s;s in his &s;eed all the nations of the earth<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 22, v, 18.</NOTE>; that he would declare he had obeyed his voice, kept his charge, his commandments, his &s;ta|tutes, and his laws, without excepting any one; or that Je&s;us Chri&s;t would have ever commended his works without any re&s;triction whatever, if the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> &s;o publickly and &s;o con&s;tantly practi&s;ed by Abraham, had been an iniquitous, unnatural pur&s;uit, e&s;&s;entially oppo&s;ite to the &s;acred laws of Nature, to the natural rights of ju&s;tice and humanity?</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="16" REF="022555_0014_0FB945C724E63290">
VIII. THE force of this powerful inference, con&s;i|dered even as a mere negative argument in favour of the intrin&s;ic licitne&s;s of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> carries &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;table weight of conviction that it amounts, in my opinion, to a po&s;itive approbation of it: it be|ing otherwi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile the ju&s;tice of God with his own &s;criptural deci&s;ions concerning the e&s;&s;en|tial impartiality, and eternal unchangeablene&s;s of its nature.</P>

<P N="20">XX. THE tran&s;actions related in this portion of Jo|&s;eph's hi&s;tory, afford us a con&s;iderable number of very pertinent reflections on the <HI>Slave-Trade:</HI> the following appear to me very remarkable.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. HERE is a whole Nation of free and independent Africans, one only de&s;cription of men excepted, in|habiting the riche&s;t, the mo&s;t populous, and the mo&s;t civilized part of Africa, or, perhaps, of any other part of the Globe, at that period, all made <HI>Slaves</HI> in one day by a mo&s;t explicit, deliberate, and formal contract.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Allowing, the Kingdom of Egypt at that time to have extended to farther than it does at pre&s;ent; that is, 600 miles from North to South, and 250 from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, it mu&s;t have contained, on the mo&s;t moderate computation, as many inhabitants, at lea&s;t, as the Kingdom of Great-Britain does at this pre&s;ent time; Egypt was then the Emporium of the whole world, where all arts and &s;ciences, commerce, agricul|ture, and polity flouri&s;hed in a degree of perfection and ro&s;ine meat, &s;uperior, perhaps, to that of any part of Europe in our days. Accordingly, the number of Africans purcha&s;ed by Jo&s;eph in one day, at the very moderate price of one year's maintainance per head, including their land, amounted, at lea&s;t, to &s;even or eight millions of per&s;ons: a number not unequal, per|&s;haps, to all the prucha&s;es of the kind ever made by Engli&s;h Merchants &s;ince the commencement of the <HI>Guinea-Trade.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The happy condition of the&s;e Africans, prior to Jo&s;eph's purcha&s;e, is a circum&s;tance worth ob&s;erv|ing: it differed in every re&s;pect from that of mo&s;t of their pre&s;ent countrymen purcha&s;ed by our European Merchants. The latter are generally Slaves, or Cap|tives,
<PB N="26" REF="022555_0024_0FB945DB640223C0">in their native land; the former were all free and independent &s;ubjects: tho&s;e, when purcha&s;ed by our African Merchants are in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute indi|gence and poverty; whereas the latter were all people of property, and, indeed, of landed property; for it is very particularly &s;pecified in the &s;eriptural account, that <HI>the Egyptians &s;old every man his field;</HI> that is, his landed e&s;tate.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The circum&s;tance of tran&s;porting Slaves from their native &s;oil into a di&s;tant country, is al&s;o very obvious in the conduct of Jo&s;eph, &s;ub&s;equent to the purcha&s;e he had made; for, <HI>as for the people,</HI> &s;ays the Scripture, <HI>he removed them to cities, from one end of the borders of Egypt, even unto the other end thereof;</HI> by which expe|dient he deprived them of every pro&s;pect of ever re|enjoying their re&s;pective paternal E&s;tates, and the places of their nativity. And, is it not more than probable, that, in the execution of &s;o exten&s;ive a plan, as removing &s;o many millions of inhabitants of every age, &s;ex, condition, and rank, infants at the brea&s;t, young children, old and decripit people, in|firm and delicate, from one end of the borders of &s;o exten&s;ive a Country as Egypt, even unto the other end thereof, many mu&s;t have inevitably peri&s;hed in pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;corching &s;ands of a Country de&s;olate with famine, and parched up, as it were, by an unin|terrupted drought of &s;ix con&s;ecutive years, whatever wi&s;e regulations me may naturally &s;uppo&s;e were made by Jo&s;eph to accommodate &s;uch an extraordinary num|ber of Slaves?</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. This numerous multitude of free and independ|ent Africans, become now by contract menial Slaves to Pharaoh, are immediately &s;ent by Jo&s;eph to culti|vate their Ma&s;ter's E&s;tates throughout all Egypt, for <HI>the land became Pharaoh's:</HI> &s;o, that we may con&s;ider them with the utmo&s;t propriety, as &s;o many Slaves,
<PB N="27" REF="022555_0025_0FB945DD6BB54CF0">tran&s;ported from their native place, and &s;ent by their Ma&s;ter, or his Steward or Over&s;eer, to work in his different Plantations, merely for their keep; for all the land was the property of Pharaoh, and the portion of the yearly produce of it, which they were allowed, is &s;aid to have been given them only <HI>for &s;eed of the field, for their food, tho&s;e of their hou&s;holds, and their little ones.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The la&s;t and mo&s;t intere&s;ting circum&s;tance, in my opinion, attending this &s;ingular tran&s;action, is the manner in which Jo&s;eph proceeded to effect his pur|cha&s;e. For, in con&s;equence of that prophetic &s;pirit, with which the Almighty had e&s;pecially favoured him, and by which he fore&s;aw the wonderful fertility of the and for &s;even years to come, and the extreme &s;terility of it for as many years after, he engro&s;&s;ed all the corn that grew in Egypt during the fir&s;t &s;even years of plenty, and laid it up again&s;t the time of impending famine<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Gen. c. 41, v. 47, 49, 55.56.</NOTE>. When this began to rage in the land, he opened his &s;tores, and made the Egyptians pay ready money for their corn: being entirely drained of ca&s;h, for <HI>Jo&s;eph gathered up all the money, that was found in the land of Egypt,</HI> he refu&s;ed to &s;upply them with broad, unle&s;s they gave all their cattle in exchange; which, accordingly, they did, for &s;uch proportion of corn as would keep them one year: being now re|duced to the la&s;t extremity, and entirely de&s;titute of provi&s;ions, as well as of every means of procuring them, &s;ave their lands and per&s;ons, he availed him|&s;elf of this favourable opportunity to effect a purcha&s;e for which he had gradually paved the way: a bargain was accordingly concluded between him and Pharaoh's &s;ubjects, by which he bought all their lands and per&s;ons for as much corn, as would keep the latter
<PB N="28" REF="022555_0026_0FB945DE6E1E80D8">the &s;pace of one year; which, from the circum&s;tance of giving them &s;eed, wherewith to &s;ow the land, ap|pears to have been the la&s;t of that &s;eptennial dearth. So, that, even taking advantage of the extreme indi|gence of his fellow-creatures, when able to relieve them, in order to reduce them to the condition of Slaves, was not deemed by this righteous, and in&s;pired Man, <HI>with whom the Lord was,</HI> an infraction of the&s;e &s;acred laws of Nature, which were the invariable rule of his conduct.</ITEM>

How far Jo&s;eph's conduct in every &s;tage of this remarkable tran&s;action, &s;o favourable to the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> may appear equitable or otherwi&s;e to the pre&s;ent humane advocates for African Liberty, through the feeble light of mere human rea&s;on and &s;en&s;e, I know not: this however is mo&s;t certain, that there is not &s;o much as one JOT in the Sacred Writings of the Word of God, that &s;eems to di&s;approve in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner, any one part of his conduct, either in this or in any other tran&s;action of his long and holy life<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 50, 26.</NOTE> On the contrary, in every place of Scrip|ture, where this eminent Per&s;onage is introduced, whether before or after this tran&s;action, he is con|&s;tantly repre&s;ented as one of the mo&s;t faithful and acceptable &s;ervants of God, under who&s;e particular protection he lived and thrived<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 39, 21, 23.</NOTE> by who&s;e im|mediate direction he acted<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Gen, ibid, and ce, 40, 41.</NOTE>; and who did nothing whatever, but the Almighty <HI>made it to pro&s;per</HI><NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 39, 23.</NOTE> The very tran&s;action, we are &s;peaking of, when rehear&s;ed by one of the in&s;pired Writers<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">P&s;. 105, v. 16-24.</NOTE>, a Man according to God's own heart<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, c, 15, 3.</NOTE>, is &s;o far from

<P N="22">XXII. A FURTHER &s;criptural evidence, that the conduct of Jo&s;eph in purcha&s;ing &s;o many millions of his fellow-creatures, and reducing them to the con|dition of Slaves, met the intire approbation of God, and was therefore perfectly con&s;onant to the &s;acred laws of Nature, is that remarkable declaration of the Word of God, regi&s;tered in the Fir&s;t book of CHRO|NICLES, c. 5. v. 1&mdash;3, which a&s;&s;igns the true rea&s;on for transfering the right of Primogeniture, or Fir&s;t-born, from the Family of Reuben; elde&s;t &s;on of Jacob, to the Family of Jo&s;eph; which, as it is expre&s;sly mentioned in that place, was Reuben's ince&s;tuous conver&s;ation with Bilhah, his Father's concubine<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 35, 22.</NOTE>&mdash;But is it credible, con&s;i&s;tently with the e&s;&s;ential ju&s;tice of God, that he &s;hould deprive Reuben's children of their Pri|mogeniture or birth-right, for having once transgre&s;&s;ed one of the Laws of Nature, and yet &s;hould at the &s;ame time, even in pre&s;erence to Judah the Me&s;&s;iah's pro+genitor, give it to tho&s;e of Jo&s;eph, who, by the very act of en&s;laving &s;o many millions of his fellow-creatures, and u&s;ing them as he did, mu&s;t have nece&s;&s;arily in|curred the horrid guilt of reiterated tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of &s;everal of tho&s;e &s;acred Laws, if, what is &s;o confidently a&s;&s;erted be true, that the SLAVE-TRADE, or the pur|cha&s;ing of Slaves, is an iniquitous unnatural pur&s;uit, and a crime of the blacke&s;t die, in direct oppo&s;ition to every principle of Nature? How could any one in &s;uch chimerical &s;uppo&s;ition reconcile the vi&s;ible par|tiality
<PB N="30" REF="022555_0028_0FB945E188CB24F8">of God's conduct with his own Scriptural decla|rations of the eternal and immutable rectitude of his ju&s;tice?</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. ONE evidence more, drawn from the &s;ame &s;criptural &s;ource of conviction, will, I hope, be &s;uffi|cient to evince the irreproachablene&s;s of Jo&s;eph's con|duct in the tran&s;action now before us. Every body knows, who knows any thing of Scripture, that the &s;peeches made to their Children by the holy Patriarchs of old, prior to their departure from this world, called in the language of Scripture <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing the Children</HI><NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 27, v. 4, 7, 10, 12, 19. &amp;c.</NOTE>, were &s;o many prophetic declarations of the Word of God, predicting to them the future events that &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h them and their families, and entailing upon them and their po&s;terity that portion of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, to which their moral or immoral conduct en|titled them. This being an undoubted truth, lot us now examine with an attentive eye &s;ome of the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances of that &s;olemn Ble&s;&s;ing, which Jacob be&s;towed on Jo&s;eph and his Brethren a little before his death<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 49.

<ITEM>1. This Ble&s;&s;ing was be&s;towed on Jo&s;eph and his Brethren about ten years after Jo&s;eph had en&s;laved all the inhabitants of Egypt, excepting the&s;e of the Sacer|dotal Order<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 47.28.</NOTE></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Jacob in this Ble&s;&s;ing reproaches Reuben, his elde&s;t &s;on, with the infamy of his ince&s;tuous crime in the &s;tronge&s;t terms; and declares, that, in puni&s;hment of it, <HI>be &s;hould not excel,</HI> but &s;hould be as <HI>un&s;table as water.</HI></ITEM>

<P>IN the&s;e prophetic and beautiful expre&s;&s;ions, ex|hibiting in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing colours the per&s;onal character of Jo&s;eph, and the ble&s;&s;ings entailed on his po&s;terity, literally fulfilled after wards, we can perceive nothing but what nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es in Jo&s;eph the greate&s;t innocence of heart, the mo&s;t unimpeachable rectitude of conduct, and the mo&s;t gracious accept|ance with his Creator. No part of his conduct is here
<PB N="32" REF="022555_0030_0FB945E9B06461C8">branded with di&s;grace, with the lea&s;t appearance of the &s;malle&s;t guilt, or with the mo&s;t di&s;tant intimation of reproof.</P>
<P>BUT, were the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> as criminal in its nature as it is pretended, were it a pur&s;uit hateful in the &s;ight of God, and an attrocious encroachment on the &s;acred rights of ju&s;tice and humanity, would Jacob, or, rather, would God, who &s;poke by his mouth, have over looked the attrocity of a crime big with &s;uch an accumulation of guilt? Would he have engaged his word to be his help and protection, and to be&s;tow &s;uch a plenitude of ble&s;&s;ings on the crown of his head, as &s;oon almo&s;t as he had concluded that Slave-contract we are &s;peaking of, and at the very time he was keep|ing in bondage &s;o many millions of his fellow-crea|tures? Would God, I &s;ay, or could God, without a mo&s;t glaring oppo&s;ition to the e&s;&s;ential rights of his own ju&s;tice, have acted thus in the ca&s;e of Jo&s;eph, and at the &s;ame time rebuke his brethren, Reuben, Sime|on, and Levy, in the &s;evere&s;t terms, and inflict a la&s;t|ing puni&s;hment on them and their po&s;terity (though the former had only one accu&s;ation again&s;t him, and the two latter pleaded in ju&s;tification of their violent proceedings the revenge due to their &s;i&s;ter Dinah, and the honor of their Father's hou&s;e<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 34. v. 7, 30, 31.</NOTE>), had not Jo|&s;eph's recent conduct in reducing &s;o many millions of free Africans to the abject condition of Slaves, as well as every other tran&s;action of his life, been perfectly agreeable to the invariable tenor of tho&s;e &s;acred Laws, of which he alone was the Author and Judge?</P>

<P N="24">XXIV. I WILL not conceal, or even di&s;gui&s;e, in favour of the cau&s;e I have e&s;pou&s;ed, what, I appre|hend, will be objected to the argument I have ju&s;t enforced, from the Scriptural account of Jo&s;eph's ex|ten&s;ive purcha&s;e of African Slaves.&mdash;It will be objected, I pre&s;ume, that Jo&s;eph purcha&s;e was not a forcible purcha&s;e; that the Egyptians, whom he bought, of|fered them&s;elves of their own accord, and de&s;ired that he would buy them at a certain price<NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 47. v. 19.</NOTE>; and that, of cour&s;e, the free and voluntary ce&s;&s;ion they made of their liberties and per&s;ons ju&s;tified Jo&s;eph's conduct, and rendered his contract ju&s;t and valid, without injuring the natural rights of ju&s;tice and humanity; which being far otherwi&s;e in the u&s;ual practice of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> in which per&s;ons are &s;old and bought without their con&s;ent, the inferences drawn in vindi|cation of that Trade from the practice of Jo&s;eph, can have no weight of conviction in &s;upport of the <HI>Slave-Trade.</HI>&mdash;No one, I tru&s;t, will tax me with partiality to my cau&s;e from the &s;tatement of this argument again&s;t my&s;elf: I have given it, I think, all the weight it is able to carry: how much it will weigh in the &s;cale of &s;ound and unprejudiced rea&s;on, will &s;oon appear from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. 1. I can by no means allow, that Jo&s;eph's purcha&s;e of Pharaoh's &s;ubjects was not a forcible pur|cha&s;e in fact, and in &s;trictne&s;s of language. It is true, the Egyptians them&s;elves, without any apparent ex|plicit propo&s;al on the part of Jo&s;eph, de&s;ired him to buy them for bread: but did they ever think of making that offer, whil&s;t they had any bread to eat, or any
<PB N="34" REF="022555_0032_0FB945ED36DAC538">means left for buying or procuring it? Did not Jo&s;eph him&s;elf, prior to that offer, pave, as it were, the way to it, by engro&s;&s;ing all the corn in the land of Egypt, and by &s;elling it to them for money and cattle, till they had neither money nor cattle to give in exchange? &mdash;Let us hear how they addre&s;s them&s;elves to him their petition will be&s;t explain, how far their offer may be called voluntary on their part. <Q><HI>They came unto him the &s;econd year,</HI> &s;ays the &s;acred Writer, <HI>and &s;aid unto him: We will not hide it from my Lord, how that our money is &s;pent; my Lord al&s;o hath our herds of cattle: there is not aught left in the &s;ight of my Lord, but our bodies and our lands.</HI> Wherefore &s;hall we die <HI>before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be &s;ervants unto Pharaoh; and give us &s;eed, that</HI> we may live and not die, <HI>that the land be not de&s;olate.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Is this the language of per&s;ons, who freely, volun|tarily, of their own accord, and without any compul|&s;ion whatever, offer them&s;elves to &s;ale? Is it not evi|dent from the very words of their own addre&s;s, that, finding them&s;elves reduced to the la&s;t extremity of in|digence, and &s;eeing nothing before their eyes but in|evitable death or &s;lavery, they were forced, through dread of the former, to &s;ubmit to the latter? And can there be a more forcible contract, than that which is made only through fear of death, only to avoid in|evitable death?&mdash;The ce&s;&s;ion then made by the Egyptians of their liberties and per&s;ons, was neither in fact, nor in &s;trictne&s;s of language, nor, indeed, in conformity with the Scriptural account of the circum|&s;tances attending it, a free and voluntary ce&s;&s;ion. Had not therefore Jo&s;eph had better grounds in the princi|ples of his Natural Religion, of which he was a mo&s;t &s;trict ob&s;erver, to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of the ju&s;tice of his
<PB N="35" REF="022555_0033_0FB945EE435030B8">contract, the ce&s;&s;ion of the Egyptians, forcible in the &s;tricte&s;t propriety of the word, would never have ren|dered his Contract ju&s;t and valid in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. But even granting, for a moment, that the Egyp|tians did really make a free and voluntary ce&s;&s;ion of their liberties and per&s;ons; I do not &s;ee, upon what principle of rea&s;on their ce&s;&s;ion could ju&s;tify Jo&s;eph's conduct and make his purcha&s;e lawful, if, as it is &s;o confidently a&s;&s;erted, the <HI>Slave Trade</HI> be e&s;&s;entially un|ju&s;t and illicit in its own nature. For, if to pur|cha&s;e tho&s;e of our own &s;pecies be highly criminal in it&s;elf, be an unju&s;t inva&s;ion on the rights of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and humanity, and directly oppo&s;ite to the Sacred Laws of Nature, how is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive, that any ce&s;&s;ion whatever of the party to be purcha&s;ed &s;hould make that <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and lawful in the &s;ight of God, which by his unalterable eternal laws is e&s;&s;entially the very rever&s;e? Can human agreements di&s;pen&s;e in the laws of God? Whatever is e&s;&s;entially <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and illicit to purcha&s;e, mu&s;t be as e&s;&s;entially <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and illicit to &s;ell.&mdash;The <HI>objection</HI> then grounded on the pretended voluntary ce&s;&s;ion of the Egyptians, however plau&s;ible it may appear at fir&s;t, is utterly inconclu&s;ive and ill founded.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. I could ea&s;ily produce a greater number of di&s;tingui&s;hed characters within this period of the Law of Nature, who&s;e uniform manner of acting, with reference to the pre&s;ent <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> would afford me an additional number of arguments in vindication of the <HI>Slave-Trade.</HI> But as the Sacred Book, where tho&s;e great Patterns of every religious and &s;ocial virtue are exhibited, is in every body's hands, and, as I have &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated, I think, from the Scriptural account of two of the mo&s;t eminent Characters with|in the &s;ame period, that the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> has the in|di&s;putable

<P N="1">1. THE Mo&s;aic Law, called al&s;o the Written Law, and the Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;ucceed|ed the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Law of Nature: not, as if, by the publication of the former<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Exod. c. 29, &amp;c.</NOTE>, the latter had been totally abrogated, or &s;uffered the lea&s;t relaxation in any of its laws, which are of perpetual obligation; but becau&s;e the Almighty willing to e&s;tabli&s;h a Cove|nant with his Cho&s;en People, the Children of I&s;rael, added to the former obligations &s;uch other &s;tatutes, Laws, and ceremonies, as were to di&s;tingui&s;h them from every other Nation in the world. This Law is very frequently called, even in Scripture, the Law of Mo&s;es<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. c. 8, v. 31, 32. Ibid. 23, 6. I. Kings, 2, 3. II. Kings, 23, 25.</NOTE> and Mo&s;es is &s;aid to have been the Law|giver or the Legi&s;lator of the Children of I&s;rael; not becau&s;e it was framed by him, but becau&s;e the Al|mighty delivered it to them through his mini&s;try, and he committed it to writing. How long this Law was in force from the fir&s;t promulgation of it, has been the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> of much inquiry among the Learned: but, without entering now into a critical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this controverted point, we may &s;afely venture to fix that period, without either advantage or <HI>prejudice</HI> to the <HI>Subject</HI> of our Re&s;earches, to the time of the Apo&s;tles Council held at Jeru&s;alem, in which the Law of Cir|cumci&s;ion and other Legal ob&s;ervances were, by an

<P N="2">II. Now, before, I proceed to &s;hew, that the Laws and Principles of this &s;econd Divine Di&s;pen&s;ation of Religion, not only never prohibited the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> but gave, on the contrary, a po&s;itive &s;anction to the pro&s;ecution of it; I judge nece&s;&s;ary to apprize the Reader, that the arguments I mean to enforce in vin|dication of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> as confined to this &s;e|cond period of true Religion, &s;hall be entirely ground|ed on &s;uch written laws and principles of internal moral rectitude, as con&s;tituted the true morality of that Religion; and not on &s;uch Legal ob&s;ervances and practices, as were peculiar to it, and con&s;tituted only the ritual, typical, or ceremonial part of its frame.

<P>AGAIN: the Hebrew, thus bought by his Brother, and reduced to the condition of a Slave, under the expre&s;s &s;anction of God, was a Child of the Circum|ci&s;ion: now, Circumci&s;ion, under the Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen|&s;ation, was a &s;olemn, religious Rite, an&s;wering that of

<P N="5">V. The farther I proceed in my Scriptural Re&s;earch|es, the &s;tronger the Evidences appear to me in favour of the <HI>Slave-Trade.</HI> Indeed, I have every encourage|ment given me in this Sacred Book of <HI>Leviticus</HI> to ad|vance a &s;tep farther, and maintain, that the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> has not only the &s;anction of Divine Authority, in its &s;upport, but was al&s;o po&s;itively encouraged (I had al|mo&s;t &s;aid, <HI>commanded</HI>) by that Authority, under the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Mo&s;aic Law.

<P N="6">VI. Is there be meaning in language, or &s;en&s;e in words, here is certainly a Law enacted by Divine Au|thority, which does not only give a mo&s;t po&s;itive and

<P N="9">IX. THE following ob&s;ervations &s;eem to ari&s;e &s;pon|taneou&s;ly from the circum&s;tances related in this inter|e&s;ting portion of Scripture.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Gibeonites were in the number of tho&s;e in|habitants of the Land of Canaan, who, by the expre&s;s command of God, were to be utterly pro&s;cribed, and driven out of the Land, by the Children of I&s;rael: <HI>Thou &s;halt make no covenant with them, nor with their Gods,</HI> &s;aid the Almighty to his People; <HI>they shall not dwell in thy Land</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Exod. c. 23, v. 31-33.</NOTE></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To ward this impending doom, of which they were well apprized, as appears from their reply to Jo&s;hua, they had recour&s;e to a &s;tratagem, which, for want of Jo&s;hua con&s;ulting the divine Oracle, &s;ucceeded to the utmo&s;t of their wi&s;hes; for they made a league, and a treaty of peace and amity with Jo&s;hua and his People; and by virtue of this National Treaty, which was confirmed to them with the &s;olemn &s;anction of an oath, and never annulled, but rather ratified in the &s;equel by God him&s;elf, they were exempted from the general doom, and became in every &s;en&s;e of the word free allies and friends to the Children of I&s;rael. In|deed, the &s;entiments of Religion and humility, &s;o
<PB N="47" REF="022555_0045_0FB9461160DA37A0">vi&s;ible both in their fir&s;t addre&s;s and their reply to Jo|&s;hua's charge, and their not joining in the general league of the neighbouring Kings, who all combined <HI>with one accord</HI> to fight again&s;t I&s;rael<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. c. 9. v, 1, 2.</NOTE>, &s;peak a &s;en&s;e of repentance, which might have induced the Al|mighty to rever&s;e his &s;entence, and &s;uffer their &s;trata|gem to &s;ucceed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. As &s;oon as this was di&s;covered, we find, that the Gibeonites were all con&s;igned by Jo&s;hua to per|petual Slavery, <HI>unto this day;</HI> that is, with all their po&s;terity; notwith&s;tanding the &s;entence of pro&s;crip|tion, the only one that the Almighty had pronounced again&s;t them, and was to be executed by Jo&s;hua, had been entirely rever&s;ed; notwith&s;tanding they had eve|ry claim, by virtue of the recent Treaty they had &s;o &s;olemnly concluded with him and his people, to all the privileges and franchi&s;es of free Allies.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="10">X. To &s;ay, that the &s;entence of death pronounced again&s;t the Gibeonites in &s;everal places of Scripture<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Exod. 23, 31-33. Deut. 7, 2, &amp;c.</NOTE>, was afterwards changed by the Almighty into that of perpetual and hereditary bondage or &s;lavery, is to ad|vance what is never to be found in any part of the Sacred Records; from the whole tenour of which it appears manife&s;t, that the perpetual bondage, to which they were con&s;igned with all their po&s;terity, was the &s;ole act and deed of Jo&s;hua, &s;ugge&s;ted apparently by the Princes of the Congregation of I&s;rael, who, prior to Jo&s;hua's cur&s;e upon them, in order to &s;ilence the murmurs of the multitude, had declared their inten|tion of employing the Gibeonites in the &s;ervile occu|pation of <HI>hewers of wood, and drawers of water unto all the Congregation.</HI></P>
<P>Now, had Jo&s;hua's &s;entence of perpetual bondage been only a commutation of that of death, to which
<PB N="48" REF="022555_0046_0FB94612E50CECA0">the Almighty had condemned the Gibeonites, had it not been lawful in it&s;elf, on other accounts, to reduce the innocent as well as the guilty to the condition of Slaves; the &s;entence of perpetual bondage pronoun|ced by Jo&s;hua, ought, one would imagine, to have extended no farther, than the per&s;ons of the Gibeonites then living, any more than did the &s;entence of death, in lieu of which that of perpetual bondage is &s;aid to have been &s;ub&s;tituted. The &s;lavery then of their in|nocent po&s;terity, at lea&s;t, cannot be &s;aid to have been in lieu of death, to which certainly they had never been condemned.</P>
<P>IT being therefore evident from the uniform tenour of the Sacred Writings, that neither the reduction of the Gibeonites then living, nor that of their guiltle&s;s de&s;cendants, yet unborn, to perpetual Slavery, was ever condemned by any mark or intimation whatever of God's di&s;plea&s;ure, but manife&s;tly ratified in the &s;e|quel by &s;everal undoubted a&s;&s;urances of his divine approbation; it is ea&s;y to conclude, whether the re|ducing of the innocent as well as the guilty part of our fellow-creatures to the condition of Slaves, or even to hereditary bondage or Slavery, be in its own nature licit or illicit, criminal or ju&s;t.</P>
<P N="11">XI. As a mark of the Almighty's undoubted ap|probation of Jo&s;hua's conduct in the tran&s;action ju&s;t before us, we find in the continuation of this hi&s;tory<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. c. 10.</NOTE> that HE even &s;ecured to his People the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Slaves, and their po&s;terity, by a mo&s;t &s;ignal victory, which he enabled them to obtain over five Kings of the Amorites; who, in con&s;equence of the Gibeonites having made a league and a treaty of peace with Jo&s;hua and his People, joined all their forces again&s;t them, and made a vigorous attempt to invade
<PB N="49" REF="022555_0047_0FB946145D45BE70">this new acqui&s;ition of the Children of I&s;rael. The exertions of his divine power for &s;ecuring to his Peo|ple this new acquired property of Slaves were &s;o won|derfully great, that he even fought <HI>in Per&s;on</HI> again&s;t the invaders; for <Q>The Lord, <HI>&s;ays the Sacred writer, di&s;comfitted them before I&s;rael, and &s;tew them with a great &s;laughter at Gibeon, and cha&s;ed them along the way that goeth up to Bethboron, and &s;mote them to Azekab, and unto Makkedab. And it came to pa&s;s, as they fled from before I&s;rael, and were in the going down to Bethboron, toat the Lord ca&s;t down great &s;tones from heaven upon them unto Aze|kah, and they died: they were more which died with bail&s;tones, than they whom the Children of I&s;rael &s;lew with the &s;word</HI><NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. c, 10, v. 10, 11.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>AND, in order to render the victory &s;till more com|plete, and the part he took in defending the rights of his people over the Gibeonites more vi&s;ible to the whole world, he even wrought a miracle of the mo&s;t &s;ingular kind: for, <HI>barkning,</HI> as the Sacred Page ex|pre&s;&s;es it, <HI>unto the voice of a Man,</HI> that is, of Jo&s;hua, who, in the heat of action, ordered <HI>the Sun to &s;tand &s;till upon Gibeon, and the Moon in the valley of Ajalon,</HI> he &s;tayed them both <HI>about a whole day, until the People had avenged them&s;elves upon their enemies</HI><NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. c, 10, v. 12, 14.</NOTE>, for attempt|ing to de&s;troy the inhabitants of Gibeon their bond|&s;laves.</P>
<P N="12">XII. IF the&s;e wonderful atchievements of the power of God in favour of his cho&s;en People in the very ca&s;e of protecting the per&s;ons, whom they had &s;o lately re|duced to perpetual and hereditary bondage, are not to be con&s;idered as &s;o many evident te&s;timonies of his divine approbation of the immediate object of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> and a po&s;itive &s;anction to the licitne&s;s
<PB N="50" REF="022555_0048_0FB9461AA26DCFF0">of it, but are &s;till con&s;i&s;tent with any intrin&s;ic moral turpitude inherent to the nature of that Trade; the abettors of this opinion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily maintain, that the Supreme Ruler of the Univer&s;e, in direct oppo|&s;ition to his own e&s;&s;ential attributes and perfections, in manife&s;t contradiction with his own moral laws and commandments, and in vindication of ill-gotten pro|perty, di&s;played to the World the mo&s;t extraordinary exertions of his Omnipotence, and di&s;turbed the very cour&s;e of Nature to make it &s;ub&s;ervient to the vile&s;t of purpo&s;es, inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion. As the in|ference is as bla&s;phemous as it is nece&s;&s;ary, the very mentioning of it will, I flatter my&s;elf, be &s;ufficient to determine the judgement of any religious and candid Reader in favour of the inherent moral licitne&s;s of the <HI>Slave-Trade.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. I HAVE, I think, &s;ufficiently proved from the Scriptural Pa&s;&s;ages I have produced in the &s;eries of this <HI>&s;econd part,</HI> that the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> has the po&s;itive &s;anction of Divine Authority in its &s;upport, and is perfectly con&s;onant to the Principles of the Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen&s;ation delineated in the Sacred Writings of the Word of God.</P>
<P>I HAVE, however, this one thing to ob&s;erve before I proceed to the <HI>third part,</HI> in order to preclude every avenue to groundle&s;s objections; that there is not a Place in all the Writings of the Word of God, whether of the <HI>Old</HI> or of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> that does &s;o much as in&s;inuate in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner, that the Slaves bought either within the period of the Law of Nature, that of the Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen&s;ation, or that of the Chri&s;tian Law, were to &s;erve during a certain number of years and no longer, except the Hebrew Slaves; who, for rea&s;ons peculiar only to that People, and not applicable even to Chri&s;tian Slaves, were to
<PB N="51" REF="022555_0049_0FB9461DB4C56258">&s;erve no longer than &s;ix years in the capacity of Bond, Slaves. In every other ca&s;e, the words <HI>Bond man, Bond-woman, Bond maid, Bond &s;ervant, Servant under the yoke,</HI> imply, in the Scripture-language, perpe|tual and unlimited bondage, bondage for life, both of the male and female reduced to that condition, and even of their po&s;terity or children, if they had any. Nor is there one in&s;tance to be met with in the Sacred Volumes, of the manumi&s;&s;ion or eman|cipation of a Slave of either &s;ex, except of the He|brew race, who ever obtained relea&s;e from bondage, on account of having &s;erved any determinate number of years.</P>
<P>THE di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Hagar, bond-woman to Abra|ham, from her Ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, is &s;o far from being an in&s;tance of this kind, that every circum&s;tance attend|ing her di&s;charge &s;eems to prove the very rever&s;e<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Gen. 21, v. 9-14.</NOTE> She was <HI>&s;ent away</HI> by Abraham, at the earne&s;t &s;olicita|tion of his wife Sarai, who&s;e coun&s;el the Almighty ordered him to follow: but the reluctance he &s;hewed to turn her out of his hou&s;e, when it was fir&s;t propo&s;ed to him by Sarai, for <HI>the thing was very grievous in his &s;ight</HI> (or, according to the Original, <HI>The word was very bad in the eyes of Abrabam,</HI>) and the rea&s;on of her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, evidently &s;hew that her di&s;charge was not in con&s;equence of any contract whatever, by which &s;he was bound to &s;erve a determinate number of years and no longer, there being not the lea&s;t intimation given in the Sacred Hi&s;tory of any &s;uch contract or agree|ment, but becau&s;e her &s;on's behaviour to I&s;aac, the promi&s;ed and right Heir of the Family, was exceed|ingly odious and very alarming to Sarai, who, dreading the con&s;equences of I&s;hmael's <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> of young I&s;aac, for &s;o the Apo&s;tle &s;tyles it<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Galat. c, 4, v. 29.</NOTE>, in&s;i&s;ted on his being <HI>ca&s;t out</HI> together with his mother Hagar.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. <HI>Scriptural Re&s;earches on the licitne&s;s of the Slave-Trade, &s;hewing its conformity with che principles of the Chri&s;|tian Di&s;pen&s;ation delineated in the</HI> Sacred Writings.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation, called frequent|ly the Chri&s;tian Law, the Law of Chri&s;t, the Chri&s;tian Religion, the Law of Grace, the New Law, and the New Covenant or the New Te&s;tament, is that mo&s;t &s;ublime and perfect Sy&s;tem of Faith and Mora|lity, which the Eternal Wi&s;dom of the Father, Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, both preached in Per&s;on, and &s;ealed with his precious blood. As this New Law and Go&s;|pel of &s;alvation is to remain in full force until the con&s;ummation of all things, or till time &s;hall be no more, it is not in the power of any creature to a&s;certain the exact time of its duration and exi&s;tence from the fir&s;t promulgation of it; for <HI>Of that day, and that hour knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in Heaven, neither the</HI> SON, <HI>but the</HI> FATHER.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Mark c, 13, v. 32.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">II. THE principal tran&s;actions relative to this New Law are regi&s;tered in the &s;everal in&s;pired Writings, that compo&s;e the Sacred Volume commonly &s;tyled <HI>The New Te&s;tament.</HI> The principles and moral duties of perpetual obligation re&s;pecting <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong, Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Inju&s;tice,</HI> regi&s;tered in this Sacred Volume, being evidently dictated by the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of God, and God him&s;elf, cannot con&s;i&s;tently with the e&s;&s;ential infallibility of his eternal Wi&s;dom, bear the lea&s;t oppo|&s;ition to the principles and moral duties of perpetual obligation re&s;pecting, in like manner, <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong, Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Injustice,</HI> dictated by the &s;ame
<PB N="54" REF="022555_0052_0FB946248E366998">infallible <HI>Spirit,</HI> and regi&s;tered in the &s;everal in&s;pired Writings, that compo&s;e the Sacred Volume com|monly &s;tyled <HI>The Old Te&s;tament,</HI> comprehending &s;uch tran&s;actions, as relate to both the Natural and the Mo&s;aic Laws. Were it po&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e, God would not be con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, and the Religion of the New Te&s;tament, in&s;tead of being the perfection and accompli&s;hment, would be the reproach and condemnation of both the former Laws, Natural and Mo&s;aic, on the truth of which its very exi&s;tence depends.</P>
<P N="3">III. FROM this undeniable po&s;ition it follows nece&s;|&s;arily, that, as the Writings of both the Te&s;taments have the &s;ame weight of Authority, e&s;&s;entially inca|pable of contradicting it&s;elf, in &s;upport of tho&s;e prin|ciples and deci&s;ions, enacted and regi&s;tered in their re&s;pective Records, concerning the intrin&s;ic morality or immorality of human actions, whatever is declared in the One to be intrin&s;ically good or bad, ju&s;t or un|ju&s;t, licit or illicit, mu&s;t inevitably be &s;o according to the principles of the Other. If, therefore, the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> appears, as, I tru&s;t it does, from the preced|ing train of Scriptural arguments, in perfect harmony with the principles and deci&s;ions of the Word of God, regi&s;tered in the Sacred Writings of the Old Te&s;ta|ment, re&s;pecting the intrin&s;ic nature of that Trade, this, of cour&s;e, can bear no oppo&s;ition to, but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be in equal perfect harmony with, the prin|ciples and deci&s;ions of the Word of God re&s;pecting <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> regi&s;tered in the Sacred Writings of the New.</P>
<P>THIS general but forcible argument, were it even un&s;upported by any collateral evidences from the Writings of the New Te&s;tament, would be fully &s;uf|ficient to verify my third and la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion re&s;pecting
<PB N="55" REF="022555_0053_0FB94625AD9451D8">the Licitne&s;s of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> as perfectly confor|mable to the principles of the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;a|tion.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I HAVE been the more particular in bringing this la&s;t part of my Scriptural Re&s;earches to this cen|tral point of view, as I have more than one rea&s;on to apprehend, that &s;everal of my Readers will be apt to imagine, that, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Chri&s;tian Religion, the Law of Mo&s;es was wholly aboli&s;hed and annulled in every part of it, and to every intent and purpo&s;e, both typical and moral, of its original in&s;ti|tution; and that, of cour&s;e, the arguments drawn in vindication of the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> from the Writings of the Old Te&s;tament, can have no weight of con|viction or authority with per&s;ons, who are &s;ubject to no other Laws and Ordinances, but tho&s;e of a Di&s;|pen&s;ation, by which that was entirely laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P N="5">V. TRUE as this a&s;&s;ertion is with re&s;pect to the ritu|al, typical, and ceremonial part of the Mo&s;aic Law, which, in this &s;en&s;e, is now utterly aboli&s;hed, and no longer obligatory to the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Go&s;pel, it is not le&s;s erroneous and fal&s;e with re&s;pect to tho&s;e fun|damental principles of righteou&s;ne&s;s enacted in that Law, which relate to the intrin&s;ic morality or immo|rality, licitne&s;s or illicitne&s;s of human actions; which, from the invariable nature of Right and Wrong, Ju&s;|tice and Inju&s;tice, mu&s;t be of perpetual obligation, and as unchangeable as God him&s;elf; who never did, nor ever could alter by any Di&s;pen&s;ation whatever tho&s;e eternal principles and laws, which are the very ba&s;is and foundation of true Religion, and con&s;equently of the Religion of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>WE have no le&s;s an authority in conformation of this indi&s;putable Doctrine, than the very words of the Son of God, who, in that divine Sermon on the Mount,
<PB N="56" REF="022555_0054_0FB94627283B60A0">in which he gave his Di&s;ciples a mo&s;t minute and cir|cum&s;tantial account of the principles and tenets of his Go&s;pel, condemned the above erroneous opinion in the mo&s;t explicit terms, and forbade them even to think of it: <HI>Think not,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that I am come to de&s;troy the Law or the Prophets; I am not come to de&s;troy but to fulfil</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Mat. c, 5, v. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>It was on the principle of this Doctrine of the Son of God, and on purpo&s;e to guard again&s;t every exception to arguments drawn from the writings of the Old Te&s;tament in favour of the</HI> Slave-Trade, <HI>which &s;ome per&s;ons would be apt to make in con&s;equence of the above erroneous opinion, that I e&s;pecially apprized the Reader in the &s;econd Num|ber of the la&s;t Section, that the arguments I meant to enforce in that Section in vindication of that Trade, would be entirely grounded, as they certainly are, on &s;uch written and explicit laws and principles of internal moral recti|tude, as con&s;tituted the true morality of the Mo&s;aic Di&s;|pen&s;ation, and not on &s;uch Legal ob&s;ervances and practices, as were peculiar to it, and con&s;tituted only the ritual, ty|pical, or ceremonial part of its frame.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. THE permanent and indefectible authority of the Old Te&s;tament, and the nece&s;&s;ary conformity of the New with the principles and declarations of the former re&s;pecting the intrin&s;ic nature of <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong, ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>inju&s;tice,</HI> being thus firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed and a&s;certained; I &s;hall now prooced, for ar|gument's &s;ake, to &s;ub&s;tantiate in a more particular manner the merits of the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y with re|ference to the principles and tenets of the New Te&s;|tament; which, from the unan&s;werable, though ge|neral, argument ju&s;t enforced, appears already to give; a &s;anction to the licitne&s;s of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> the in|trin&s;ic morality of which is &s;o evidently warranted
<PB N="57" REF="022555_0055_0FB94628C7805960">by tho&s;e invariable principles and deci&s;ions of the Old, with which, as proved before, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily agree.</P>
<P N="7">VII. THAT there is nothing in the Writings of the New Te&s;tament, that can be produced in ju&s;tification of the <HI>Slave-Trade.</HI> has been confidently a&s;&s;erted by many, and from this <HI>Juppo&s;ed &s;ilence</HI> of the In&s;pired Writers, they have as confidently concluded, that the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity are not ju&s;tifiable in pro&s;e|cuting a Trade, which, not having, in their opinion, the Sanction of the New Te&s;tament, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be e&s;&s;entially oppo&s;ite to the principles of true Chri&s;ti|anity, which forbids in the mo&s;t explicit terms, and under the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments, all acts of inju&s;tice, unnaturalne&s;s, and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. THE &s;tronger this inference, founded indeed on a fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition, appears to the advocates for African Liberty again&s;t the licitne&s;s of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> the more powerful the following arguments mu&s;t appear to them; which, from the &s;ame negative principle, not of <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> but <HI>real,</HI> &s;ilence re&s;pecting the pretended illicitne&s;s of it, amounting in fact to a po&s;itive &s;anction in our Ca&s;e, &s;eem manife&s;tly to evince, that the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> bears no oppo&s;ition whatever to the principles of the Chri&s;tian Law.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. IF the Writings of the New Te&s;tament mention nothing, as it is <HI>fal&s;ely &s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> in vindication of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> neither do they <HI>in reality</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> mention any thing in condemnation of it; if then the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> &s;ilence of the In&s;pired Writers re&s;pecting the licitne&s;s of that Trade, that is, their not mentioning that Trade at all, as it is <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> can be brought as an argument of its moral incon&s;i&s;tency with the prin|ciples of true Chri&s;tianity; the <HI>real</HI> &s;ilence of the &s;ame re&s;pecting the pretended illicitne&s;s of it, that is, their not condemning the Trade at all, though pub|lickly
<PB N="58" REF="022555_0056_0FB9462A31675E90">practi&s;ed in their time, and by the very per&s;ons whom they were deputed to teach the principles and duties of Chri&s;tianity, mu&s;t be a &s;tronger argument by far of the inherent moral conformity of the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> with the principles and tenets of the Religion of Chri&s;t: for it &s;hews in the &s;tronge&s;t light, that the fir&s;t Teachers of Chri&s;tianity, who were al&s;o the In|&s;pired Writers of the New Te&s;tament, never con&s;idered the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> or had been taught by their Ma&s;|ter to con&s;ider it, as an infraction of any of the prin|ciples or moral precepts of his Go&s;pel.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In effect; this con&s;tant and uniform &s;ilence of the Sacred Writers of the New Te&s;tament in a matter of &s;uch public notoriety; I mean their never di&s;approving the practice of a Trade, in which the rights of Chri&s;tian ju&s;tice and humanity are &s;aid to be &s;o materially injured, ought to attract the particular affention of every impar|tial inquirer into the merits of the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y.
<P>IT is an ab&s;olute fact, atte&s;ted by all Hi&s;torians, both Sacred and Prophane, that at the very time that Chri&s;|tianity made its appearance in the World, as well as at the time that the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t were employed in preaching and propagating through|out the World his holy Go&s;pel and Doctrine, both before and after the &s;ame had been committed to writing, that is, before and after the New Te&s;tament was written, that the practice of Slavery, or the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> was univer&s;ally adopted by the very Nations to whom they brought the glad tidings of &s;alvation, and who, through faith, repentance, and obedience to the maxims and doctrine they preached, were received into the Cove|nant of reconciliation and grace; and yet it is not le&s;s cer|tain from the con&s;tant tenour of the Sacred Wrtings of the New Te&s;tament, that de&s;i&s;ting from the pro&s;ecution of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> or manumitting tho&s;e who were in actual bondage, was never declated by any of the Apo&s;|tles
<PB N="59" REF="022555_0057_0FB9462BB3017AD8">or fir&s;t Teachers of Chri&s;tianity to be a nece&s;&s;ary term of Salvation or acceptance with God, or an in|di&s;pen&s;able duty of a follower of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT were the Trade &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to the principles of Chri&s;tianity, as it is a&s;&s;erted, were it a mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable u&s;urpation of the &s;acred rights of ju&s;tice and humanity, would the Apo&s;tles have &s;uffer|ed tho&s;e &s;acred rights to be thus invaded and trampled upon with impunity, without &s;o much as &s;ignifying to tho&s;e, whom they were commi&s;&s;ioned to teach the Go&s;pel of righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, of love and charity, that it was in open contradiction with the principles and precepts of that Go&s;pel.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. IN FINE: this manner of rea&s;oning to prove the moral conformity of the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> with the prin|ciples of the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation, acquires a degree of irre&s;i&s;table force, when applied to the conduct of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in his public character of Founder and Teacher of the New Law; for though he em|braced every opportunity of reproving in the &s;evere&s;t terms &s;uch irreligious abu&s;es as were practi&s;ed by the Jews, and of rectifying &s;uch fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es, traditions, and comments, as had been added by them to the Law of Mo&s;es, yet he never once condemned, reproved, or even hinted the lea&s;t di&s;approbation of the practice of Slavery, &s;o generally adopted in his time: no, not even in his Divine Sermon on the Mount, in which he &s;poke on &s;et purpo&s;e of the mo&s;t exalted duties of his Religion, entered into a minute and mo&s;t circum&s;tan|tial detail of many reciprocal offices and duties he re|quired of his followers, and rectified &s;ome abu&s;es, in|comparably le&s;s criminal than would be that of en|&s;laving our fellow creatures, were this practice &s;o very criminal and unju&s;t as is repre&s;ented by &s;ome modern advocates for African Liberty<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Matt. cc, 5, 6, 7.</NOTE></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="60" REF="022555_0058_0FB9462D1FB0EA40">
4. THE fact is: that &s;ince neither the SON of God, being him&s;elf God, nor his Di&s;ciples commi&s;&s;ioned to teach his doctrine, could ever after the intrin&s;ic nature of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong;</HI> once the practice of Slavery, or the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> had been expre&s;sly declared by the FATHER e&s;&s;entially ju&s;t and lawful in the Sacred Writ|ings of the Old Law, which, the SON <HI>did not come to de&s;troy, but to fulfil</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Matt. c, 5, v, 17.</NOTE>, it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, that either HE or his Di&s;ciples &s;hould declare it unlaw|ful and unju&s;t in the Writings of the New, the prin|ciples of both the Laws, re&s;pecting the intrin&s;ic nature of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong, Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Inju&s;tice,</HI> being inva|riably the &s;ame,</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>IT follows then, that the argument drawn in favour of the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> from the con&s;tant &s;ilence of the In&s;pired Writers of the New Te&s;tament re&s;pecting the pretended illicitne&s;s of that Trade, that is, from their never mentioning any thing again&s;t the licitne&s;s of it, which in the cirum&s;tances above related, would have been only a negative inference, though of con&s;iderable weight in vindication of it, becomes now, from this la&s;t very material circum&s;tance, a mo&s;t powerful po&s;i|tive argument, &s;hewing in the &s;tronge&s;t light, that the nature of the <HI>Slave-Trade</HI> is perfectly con&s;onant to the principles and tenets of the Chri&s;tian Law.</P>
<P N="9">IX. THOUGH the argument built on the-<HI>&s;uppo&s;ed &s;ilence</HI> of the In&s;pired Writers of the New Te&s;tament re&s;pecting the licitne&s;s of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> is very amply comfuted by the preceding arguments drawn from the <HI>real &s;ilence</HI> of the &s;ame Sacred Writers re&s;|pecting the pretended illicitne&s;s of it, which are, in|deed, abundantly &s;ufficient to eftabli&s;h beyond the power of cavil or reply this la&s;t part of my <HI>Scriptural Re&s;earches;</HI> yet, le&s;t any one &s;hould &s;till per&s;i&s;t in

<ITEM>1.

<P N="12">XII. From the tenour of the&s;e Apo&s;tolic in&s;truc|tions, confirmed by many other &s;imilar declarations to the &s;ame effect, frequently occurring in the Writings of the New Te&s;tament, I am naturally led to deduce the following con&s;equences in &s;upport of the licitne&s;s of the <HI>Slave-Trade.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. IT is then evident from the Doctrine of St. Paul, that Chri&s;tians, however entitled by Bapti&s;m to the Spiritual freedom of Children of God, and Heirs of heaven, ought yet, when under the yoke of human bondage or &s;lavery, con&s;ider them&s;elves under the &s;tricte&s;t obligation of reverencing the authority of their Ma&s;ters, even of unbelieving Ma&s;ters, <HI>and counting them worthy of all honour.</HI> But were the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> or the keeping of our fellow-creatures in bondage, unnatural and unju&s;t, it could never be &s;aid, that Slaves were under the lea&s;t obligation in con&s;cience to reverence and obey an unju&s;t, an unnatural authority; or that their Ma&s;ters, who, by reducing them to that abject condition, had trampled on the Sacred Rights of ju&s;tice and humanity, <HI>were worthy of all honour,</HI> or, indeed, of any &s;hadow of honour, but, on the con|trary, of all di&s;honour and reproach.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. IT is likewi&s;e evident from the Apo&s;tle's doc|trine, that the primitive Chri&s;tians were not only not forbidden, but expre&s;sly allowed by the principles of our Religion the purcha&s;ing of Slaves, and keeping their fellow-creatures, nay even their fellow-Chri&s;ti|ans, under the yoke of bondage or Slavery; and from the circum&s;tance of their Slaves being &s;o particularly cautioned not to con&s;ider them&s;elves on the footing of natural equality with their Ma&s;ters, not to de&s;pi&s;e them and their authority for being their equals in all &s;piritual attainments and franchi&s;es, but to &s;how, on

NEITHER can it be &s;aid, that this doctrine, perhaps, novel to &s;ome of my Readers, which Timo|thy is directed <HI>to teach and to exhort,</HI> was only the private opinion of St. Paul; for he declares to him in expre&s;s words, that it is <HI>a doctrine according to godli|ne&s;s,</HI> the very doctrine of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, and not to be contradicted by any one, without incurring the ac|cumulated guilt of pride and folly with a criminal train of attendants: <Q><HI>If any man,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>teach other|wi&s;e, and con&s;ent not to whole&s;ome words, even the words of our</HI> Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>and to the doctrine, which is according to godline&s;s, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about que&s;tions, and &s;trifes of words, whereof cometh envy, &s;trife, railings, evil &s;urmifings, &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>EPISTLE TO PHILEMON.</HEAD>
<P N="15">XV. PHILEMON, to whom St. Paul addre&s;&s;es this affectionate Epi&s;tle, was a rich Colo&s;&s;ian, and a Chri&s;|tian of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit. The character given of him in-the fir&s;t part of this Epi&s;tle, repre&s;ents him as one of the mo&s;t zealous and fervent Chri&s;tians of his time. His a&s;&s;iduity in promoting the intere&s;t of Chri&s;|tianity in quality of <HI>Fellow-labourer</HI> with St. Paul<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Ep. to Phil. v. 1.</NOTE>, his <HI>love and faith towards the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> and his ge|nerous unbounded charity <HI>towards all the &s;aints,</HI> or his fellow, Chri&s;tians<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Ibid. v. 5.</NOTE>, whom he relieved and comfort|ed on all occa&s;ions<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Ibid. v. 7.</NOTE>, gained him the confidence, e&s;teem, and affection of the Apo&s;tle and of the whole Church at large<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Ibid. v. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. THIS Primitive and exemplary Chri&s;tian had in his &s;ervice one <HI>One&s;imus</HI> a Slave, who, as it is very &s;trongly intimated by St. Paul, having defrauded his Ma&s;ter of &s;ome part of his property, and knowing the influence the Apo&s;tle had over him, eloped from his Ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, went to Rome, where St. Paul was then in pri&s;on, was converted by him, and received into the Communion of the Chri&s;tian Church<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Ibid. v. 10.</NOTE>; and hav|ing by his good &s;ervices and chri&s;tian conduct, gained the Apo&s;tle's favour, he &s;eems to have prevailed on him to write to his Ma&s;ter Philemon in his behalf.</P>

</LIST>
<P N="19">XIX. THE following obvious remarks, adapted to the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent inquiry re&s;pecting the moral licitne&s;s of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> &s;eem naturally to ari&s;e from the tenour of this &s;acred portion of Scripture.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Apo&s;tle declares in the fir&s;t place, that, were he to act in the plentitude of his. Apo&s;tolic commi&s;&s;ion and Authority, without any regard to the dictates of his love and friend&s;hip for Philem on, he would not u&s;e the &s;tyle of a &s;uppliant, as he does, but would pe|remptorily enjoin him to receive his fugitive Slave in|to his hou&s;e and &s;ervice, which he is bound to do in decency and duty: the word <HI>Convenient</HI> in the Original has both the&s;e meanings. From which declaration it evidently, follows, that the Apo&s;tle was &s;o far from thinking, that Philemon had acted wrong or unju&s;tly in keeping One&s;imus in bondage, when yet an unbe|liever,
<PB N="68" REF="022555_0066_0FB946D82A35EC68">that he a&s;&s;ures him, on the contrary, he would act in oppo&s;ition to his duty, or unju&s;tly, in not re|ceiving him again, when baptized, into his hou&s;e and &s;ervice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. This declaration acquires a &s;uperior degree of force from the circum&s;tance he &s;ubjoins to his reque&s;t, as a powerful inducement for Philemon to receive him again into his &s;ervice. This circum&s;tance, alluding to the name of <HI>One&s;imus,</HI> which in Greek is the &s;ame as <HI>Profitable,</HI> is both beautiful and intere&s;ting. The Apo&s;tle owns, without di&s;gui&s;e, that One&s;imus, <HI>in time pa&s;t bad</HI> certainly <HI>been an unprofitable,</HI> or, in Scripture|language, <HI>a bad Servant</HI><NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Matt. c, 25. v. 30.</NOTE>: but, as he could now a&s;&s;ure Philemon, that he was quite reclaimed, and become <HI>profitable</HI> to both, he earne&s;tly &s;olicits his read|mi&s;&s;ion, in order that he may be enabled to make amends for his pa&s;t negligence and inattention to his &s;ervice by his future diligence and a&s;&s;iduity.&mdash;It was then One&s;imus's duty to have been u&s;eful and <HI>profitable</HI> to his Ma&s;ter Philemon, whil&s;t under the yoke of &s;ervitude; and it was an act of manife&s;t inju&s;tice in him to have been <HI>unprofitable</HI> and of no &s;ervice. Phi|lemon then had a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and undoubted right to the &s;ervice of One&s;imus, as his Slave; or el&s;e One&s;imus could never have been taxed by the Apo&s;tle with acting the part of an <HI>unprofitable</HI> or <HI>bad &s;ervant,</HI> or with any per&s;onal <HI>inju&s;tice,</HI> for neglecting a &s;ervice, which Phi|lemon had no right or title to demand.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Again: to convince Philemon, how much One|&s;imus was changed for the better &s;ince his elopement, and the great reformation that his conver&s;ion to Chri&s;|tianity had wrought in his morals and conduct, he tells him, how much he was inclined him&s;elf to keep him in his own &s;ervice; intimating to him in this delicate and
<PB N="69" REF="022555_0067_0FB946D9B5F71FE0">gentle manner, that he could have no objection to re|ceive again into his &s;ervice a per&s;on &s;o well qualified, as One&s;imus was then, to be an Apo&s;tle's Servant: and he a&s;&s;ures him further, that the only rea&s;on that has prevented him from indulging his inclination to detain him, has been his not having had his leave and con|&s;ent for &s;o doing; <HI>without which,</HI> &s;ays he, he would never attempt to deprive him of his Slave. From this declaration it appears in the &s;tronge&s;t light, how very &s;acred and inviolable the acquired rights of Ma&s;ters over their Slaves, even of Chri&s;tian Ma&s;ters and Slaves, were held by St. Paul, who would not by any means deprive Philemon of One&s;imus, however u&s;eful the latter was to him at that time, and whatever a&s;cen|dency he had over his Ma&s;ter, without having fir&s;t obtained his expre&s;s approbation and con&s;ent: he would then, &s;ays he, receive One&s;imus, as a <HI>benefit</HI> perfectly gratuitous, as a free and voluntary gift made to him by Philemon of &s;o valuable a part of his property.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Till he obtains this con&s;ent, he &s;ends One&s;imus back to his lawful Ma&s;ter, entreating him in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing and affectionate manner, to u&s;e him with all po&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s and regard: to con&s;ider him now as a member of the Communion of the true believers, and con&s;equently not in the character of a common menial Slave, but as his own brother in Chri&s;t, though &s;till his property <HI>according to the fle&s;h,</HI> which to him particularly ought to be dearer then ever, as being now con&s;ecrated to God.&mdash;And le&s;t Philemon &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on One&s;imus making due &s;atis&s;action for having de&s;rauded him of his time, or other property, and &s;hould, on that account, u&s;e him with &s;everity, the Apo&s;tle engages to make him full reparation, and be|comes him&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for the whole: which is a
<PB N="70" REF="022555_0068_0FB946DB2867EAF8">manife&s;t acknowledgement of Philemon's right, as the lawful Ma&s;ter of One&s;imus, to inflict due puni&s;hment on his <HI>Slave.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="20">XX. From the&s;e ob&s;ervations, &s;o naturally flowing from the Contents of the Apo&s;tle's letter to Philemon, the&s;e two nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences &s;eem as naturally to follow.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Had St. Paul, who had been in&s;tructed in the principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, not by men, but immediately by Chri&s;t him&s;elf<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Galat. c, 1, v. 1.</NOTE>, <HI>who&s;e cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el he was to bear his name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the Children of I&s;rael</HI><NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Acts c, 9, v. 15.</NOTE>, been taught by his Divine Ma&s;ter, that the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> or the pur|cha&s;ing of Slaves, or keeping tho&s;e already purcha&s;ed in &s;ervitude or bondage, was an unnatural, iniquitous pur&s;uit, contrary to the Spirit of his Religion, he would have certainly addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Philemon in a very different &s;tyle from that of his pre&s;ent Letter: and in&s;tead of acting the part of a Suppliant, the part of an interce&s;&s;or and Mediator, as he does, in &s;olicit|ing of him the re-admi&s;&s;ion of a fugitive Slave, he would have a&s;&s;umed the &s;tyle and tone of a Ma&s;ter; would have &s;everely condemned the unju&s;tifiable con|duct of Philemon in detaining him in criminal bond|age, contrary to the Laws of his holy Religion, would have commended the &s;pirited conduct of One&s;imus in &s;haking off the heavy yoke of &s;ervitude, would not have &s;uffered him to return to his unnatural Ma&s;ter Philemon, e&s;pecially after he had converted him to Chri&s;tianity, and entitled him by Bapti&s;m to the glo|rious franchi&s;es and liberty of the Children of God, and would not have &s;tood on complimentary ceremo|nies, finding him u&s;eful in his actual &s;tate of confine|ment,
<PB N="71" REF="022555_0069_0FB946DCB0546408">to retain him in his mini&s;try, without a&s;king his pretended Ma&s;ter's leave, or without his con&s;ent.
<P>THIS, I am confident, would have been the language and conduct of the Apo&s;tle, had he been taught by his Divine Ma&s;ter, that the principles and Doctrine of the Go&s;pel, he was commi&s;&s;ioned to preach, were in direct oppo&s;ition to the practice of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> to the practice of purcha&s;ing Slaves, or keeping tho&s;e al|ready purcha&s;ed in bondage or &s;lavery.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. But, &s;ince the Apo&s;tle, conformably to the in|&s;tructions he had received from his Lord and Ma&s;ter JESUS CHRIST, re&s;pecting every part of a Chri&s;tian's duty, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in this Epi&s;tle, as well as in every other, where he &s;peaks on this much mi&s;repre|&s;ented &s;ubject, in terms and language diametricatly oppo&s;ite to the &s;entiments ju&s;t mentioned; we are forced to conclude, that, &s;ince Philemon, as well as many other Primitive Chri&s;tians, cotemporary with the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t and fir&s;t Teachers of Chri&s;|tianity, kept Slaves, even Chri&s;tian Slaves, in their &s;ervice, in the very face of the whole Church, and with the approbation and knowledge of the primitive Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, as has been demon|&s;trated from &s;ome of the cleare&s;t te&s;timonies of the New Te&s;tament, the nature of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> be|ing &s;o vi&s;ibly authori&s;ed by the po&s;itive &s;anction of the&s;e Sacred Writings, mu&s;t be e&s;&s;entially ju&s;t and lawful in its principles, and perfectly con&s;onant to tho&s;e of the Chri&s;tian Law.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="21">XXI. EVIDENT as this conclu&s;ion appears from the Scriptural arguments enforced in the cour&s;e of this Section, I cannot clo&s;e the Subject of the&s;e Re&s;earch|es, without taking &s;ome notice of what, I apprehend, will be objected again&s;t it from the Words of our Ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour in his divine Sermon on the Mount, which in the eighth Number of this Section I declared with
<PB N="72" REF="022555_0070_0FB946DE2BA95A58">particular &s;tre&s;s to contain nothing again&s;t the licitne&s;s of the <HI>Slave-Trade.</HI>&mdash;The Words, bere alluded to, will, I pre&s;ume, be thus retorted again&s;t it.</P>
<P><HI>All things what&s;oever,</HI> &s;ays our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <HI>ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets</HI><NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Matt. c, 7, v. 12.</NOTE>: what&s;oever things therefore we would not, that men &s;hould do to us, we are not even &s;o to do to them; but no per&s;on whatever would certainly wi&s;h, that a fellow-creature &s;hould reduce him to the condition of a Slave; there|fore no per&s;on whatever is to reduce a fellow-creature to that condition.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. HERE again I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that no one can ju&s;tly tax me with any partiality to the Cau&s;e I have e&s;pou&s;ed: I have, I think, worded the argument again&s;t it in terms as forcible, as the mo&s;t zealous advocate for African Liberty, could u&s;e. But unan&s;werable as the &s;ame may appear to them, it is but a plau&s;ible argu|ment at the be&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>It is an Axiom in Logic, that An argument that proves too much, proves nothing: the above is ju&s;t &s;uch a one: for, by the &s;ame manner of rea&s;oning, one might equally conclude, contrary to the Law and the Prophets, and the doctrine of the Chri&s;tian Religion, that not only Slavery, but every other kind of &s;ubordination of one man to another, ought not to be &s;uffered to continue in the world.&mdash;The argument, if conclu&s;ive in the former ca&s;e, mu&s;t be equally &s;o in the latter:</HI> I enforce it thus: <HI>All things what&s;oever,</HI> &s;ays our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <HI>ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets:</HI> what&s;oever things there|fore we would not that men &s;hould do to us, we are not even &s;o to do to them; but every per&s;on would na|turally
<PB N="73" REF="022555_0071_0FB946DFAAE9B7C0">wi&s;h not to be controlled by a fellow-creature, not to be under any &s;ubjection to him, but to be ab&s;o|lute ma&s;ter of his own actions; no per&s;on therefore ought to keep a fellow-creature under any control or &s;ubjection whatever.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. SUCH is the con&s;equence of wre&s;ting the natural and obvious meaning of the maxims of Scrip|ture, and applying them to purpo&s;es incon&s;i&s;tent with Scripture it&s;elf. The Golden Maxim of our Divine Ma&s;ter, comprehending in two words the whole per|fection of a Chri&s;tian, was certainly intended by him for all &s;tations in life, for of &s;uch was his Church to con&s;i&s;t to the end of time: from the Throne to the Cottage, in every walk of life, in bondage or at liberty, every Chri&s;tian is taught and directed To do unto others, as he would be done unto; and, by a ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. Not to do unto others, as he would not be done unto that is, every Chri&s;tian is commanded to behave to his neighbour, in what|ever &s;ituation or circum&s;tances in life Providence may have placed them both, ju&s;t as he would wi&s;h his neighbour would behave to him in his &s;ituation, were his neighbour's &s;ituation and circum&s;tances his own: &s;o that, to apply the Maxim to a particular Ca&s;e (even the Ca&s;e in que&s;tion), no Chri&s;tian Ma&s;ter can be &s;aid <HI>to do unto others as he would be done unto,</HI> unle&s;s he behaves to his Slave with the &s;ame tenderne&s;s, ju&s;tice, and humanity, as he would wi&s;h his Slave would be|have to him, were the Slave his Ma&s;ter, and him&s;elf the Slave; and, upon the &s;ame principle, no Slave can be &s;aid <HI>to do unto others as he would be done unto,</HI> unle&s;s he &s;erves his Ma&s;ter with the &s;ame fidelity, &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, and re&s;pect, which he would expect from his Ma&s;ter, were the latter his Slave, and him&s;elf the Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="24"><PB N="74" REF="022555_0072_0FB946E18D41E3F0">
XXIV. THE <HI>Golden Maxim</HI> then, of <HI>doing unto others, as we would be done unto,</HI> is &s;o far from con|demning in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner the pro&s;ecution of the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> that, when applied to the Ca&s;e of Chri&s;tian Ma&s;ters and their Slaves, it &s;erves, on the contrary, to enforce their reciprocal duties in their different &s;pheres of life. Neither could it be other|wi&s;e, &s;eeing, that the &s;ame Divine Authority, on which the truth of the above Maxim is founded, has &s;o fre|quently given his &s;anction in the writings of both the Te&s;taments to the licitne&s;s of the <HI>Slave-Trade.</HI></P>
<P N="25">XXV. I HAVE now, I think, verified in its full ex|tent the a&s;&s;ertion I engaged to prove in the Title-page; that the&s;e Scriptural Re&s;earches on the licitne&s;s of the Slave-Trade, would &s;hew the moral conformity of that Trade with the Principles of Natural and Revealed Religion delineated in the Sacred Writings of the Word of God: and as I prefixed to the whole certain Po&s;itions or Data, on the Truth of which the undenia|ble religious certainty of that moral conformity is en|tirely founded, &s;o I &s;hall now annex to the whole a few Corollaries or Con&s;equences, which, from their nece&s;|&s;ary dependance on the former Data, mu&s;t convince every religious and candid Reader of the nece&s;&s;ity of acquie&s;cing in the Scriptural Doctrine enforced in the&s;e Re&s;earches.</P>
