<P><PB N="4" REF="004067_0005_1003C238C9839BA0">
If we &s;earch the ORIGIN of this Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty; the <HI>Scripture-Hi&s;tory</HI> tell us, It ari&s;es from the bold <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Two fo&s;t Prents</HI> of all Mankind. While they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in their primaeval Innocence they had no Principles or Cau&s;es of Mortality in them. And &s;uch a State indeed was but agreable to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Goodne&s;s of their Creator.</P>
<P>For however He may deal with <HI>Brutes,</HI> which are not moral Agents with re&s;pect to GOD, are not capable of his moral Govern|ment, can neither know Him nor his Laws, nor therefore brake them, nor receive from Him a proper Puni&s;hment: who have no Conceptions of a Future World, nor any different Apprehen&s;ion between Death and Sleep: but in the pre&s;ent State, their Pains and Plea&s;ures may be intirely adju&s;ted: and with re&s;pect to whom, it may be no more Unkindne&s;s in their Creator to take away their Lives, then after a fatiguing Day to let them fall a&s;leep at Night, or in that Sleep to let them expire. Yet it would &s;eem incon&s;i&s;tent with his e&s;&s;ential <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> to have created our fir&s;t Pa|rents moral Agents, with Powers and Inclinations of looking for|ward to a Future State and inten&s;e De&s;ires of Immortality, with Powers of knowing and doing his Will; and yet have made them in a natural Subjection to the Power of Death, when they had neither Guilt nor &s;inful Inclination in them. And it would &s;eem incon&s;i&s;tent with his e&s;&s;ential <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> to have created them with &s;inful Inclinations, which mu&s;t have flowed from Him&s;elf alone.</P>
<P>As they fir&s;t came out of the Hands of their Maker, they were therefore free both from Sin and Death: they had neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Appetites nor mortal Principles in them: both perfe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|cence and Life then fill'd and reigned in their Con&s;titutio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and if they had retain'd their Innocence, they had never Die<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> been &s;ubject to Mortality.</P>

But as they were <HI>moral Agents,</HI> capable of knowing their Ma|ker, of de&s;cerning his Perfections, of di&s;covering his Will, and of yeilding a free Obedience to Him; it was but fitting they &s;hould be under his <HI>moral Government,</HI> and retain'd in their &s;pontaneous Subjection to Him. It was &s;itting, they &s;hou'd freely obey his Will and avoid the contrary; that they &s;hou'd faithfully ob&s;erve the Laws of undepraved Nature, which mu&s;t be his Will, and avoid the Violation of them.

<P N="2">II. We are now to take &s;ome View of that perplexing DARKNESS about a FUTURE STATE, which involves the Minds of Men by Nature.</P>
<P>This is plainly hinted in the Words before us: And by looking a little into this gloomy Scene, we may more &s;en&s;ibly find the Need of that di&s;covering Light our Saviour brings us, the more highly prize it, and the more rejoice in its Illuminations.</P>
<P>And here it cannot be proper to con&s;ider what <HI>Di&s;coveries</HI> of a FUTURE STATE the <HI>meer Rea&s;on</HI> of Men is <HI>able</HI> to make. For we who are born, bro't up and live in the mid&s;t of Revelation, have
<PB N="13" REF="004067_0014_1003A13E07D877F8">thereby received great Numbers of Ideas and Rea&s;ons; which be|cau&s;e we find agreable to our improved Under&s;tandings, are there|fore apt to think our Minds might have di&s;covered them without this Revelation: when 'tis from this Revelation only we have de|riv'd them, and 'tis difficult therefore if not impo&s;&s;ible to know whether our mo&s;t impro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ands without it cou'd have made the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Our Bu&s;ine&s;s then is to con&s;ider the univer&s;al Darkne&s;s about this Matter, which <HI>in Fact</HI> involved the World before CHRIST ap|peared, and which even <HI>yet</HI> involves the ungo&s;pelized Nations.</P>
<P>Nor need we look among the <HI>common Herd</HI> of Men, where the Ignorance even of the mo&s;t ingenious and penetrating Minds a|mong them, appears amazing: as any may find by con&s;ulting with their Slaves from <HI>Africa,</HI> or our more &s;agacious <HI>American Indians</HI> who have not yet receiv'd the Go&s;pel. Their Minds with all their Powers have neither certainly di&s;covered a <HI>Future State,</HI> nor even &s;carcely that Univer&s;al Being, who made, pervades and rules the World. Some of them indeed have &s;ome Notion of a <HI>Future Exi&s;tence:</HI> Yet if you enquire, you'l find they have no Certainty, nor any Rea&s;ons, but rather meerly &s;ome Su&s;picion; or are in|clin'd to think &s;o, becau&s;e &s;ome others as ignorant as they have told them: But as for the <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> it never entered their Su&s;|picion. And &s;uch extremely dark and uncertain Notions we may well &s;uppo&s;e, that other <HI>common Heathens</HI> had, who liv'd before the Time of CHRIST'S Appearing; as al&s;o tho&s;e who yet remain without the Influence of his Revelation.</P>
<P>But we may rather &s;ee this Darkne&s;s, by enquiring of the <HI>mo&s;t improved</HI> Men among the old <HI>Egyptians, Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> For Learning among the Gentiles &s;eems to have flouri&s;h'd 1&s;t in <HI>Egypt;</HI> thence to pa&s;s to <HI>Greece,</HI> and thence to <HI>Rome.</HI> And according to

<P><HI>Socrates,</HI> who was Born about <HI>a Hundred Years</HI> after the Birth of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> improv'd upon the Soul's Immortality. But in his fine Oration made to his Judges upon his receiving the Sentence of Death; tho' He ri&s;es into noble Sugge&s;tions of the <HI>Future State,</HI> yet his manner of &s;peaking plainly makes them to be plea&s;ing Suppo|&s;itions only, without any Certainty: and after all He clo&s;es thus &mdash; <Q>But now it is time for us to depart Hence, I to Dye, You to Live: but whether of the Two be Be&s;t, the Immortal Gods only know; for I believe no Man does.</Q></P>

Diver&s;e Predictions of Him were entered on faithful Re|cords; as that He was to &s;pring from <HI>Abrabam,</HI> then from <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> then from <HI>Jacob,</HI> then from <HI>Judab,</HI> then from <HI>David:</HI> and a mighty Nation was rai&s;ed up from the Loins of <HI>Jacob</HI> to pre&s;erve tho&s;e Records, to look for his Appearance, proclaim their Expectations to the World, and bare witne&s;s of it. And when about <HI>Four whou|&s;and Years</HI> were pa&s;t from the <HI>Creation,</HI> the PRINCE OF LIFE is Born of a Pious Virgin derived from <HI>David.</HI> When the <HI>Fullne&s;s of Time was come,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, GOD <HI>&s;ent forth</HI> HIS SON, <HI>made of
<PB N="21" REF="004067_0022_1003C2ABC155EB40">a Woman, made under the Law, to Rediem them that were under the Law,</HI> [i. e. the Condemnation and Puni&s;hment denounc'd therein] <HI>and receive the Adoptions of Sons.</HI> Gal. iv. 4, 5.</P>
<P>For, our Fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion being ju&s;tly Threatned and Puni&s;hed with <HI>Death;</HI> the Threatning mu&s;t be executed, the Puni&s;hment en|dured; the Divine Ju&s;tice, Holine&s;s, Authority, Law and Govern|ment mu&s;t not loo&s;e their due Regard or Honour, but be magnified in every Eye, and the Divine Truth pre&s;erv'd inviolate. For the&s;e great Ends He therefore takes our Nature, but in perfect Purity, yet cloath'd with our Infirmities; that having no Sin of his own, He might be intirely &s;uitable to repre&s;ent <HI>us,</HI> to bare the Puni&s;h|ment due to <HI>us,</HI> and in our Nature yield that full Obedience and Regard to God which is due therefrom, and which we have lo&s;t our Power to yield; that by the mo&s;t perfect and meritorious Suf|ferings and Obedience even unto Death of &s;uch a Per&s;on infinite in Excellence and Dignity, He might Purcha&s;e for us compleat Re|demption and eternal Happine&s;s, with the rightful Power of be|&s;towing them on us; and that the Glory of every divine Perfection might appear and harmonize throughout all the Progre&s;s of this &s;tupendeous Work.</P>
<P>Ob&s;cure and faint indeed He was at his fir&s;t Appearance; that He might unob&s;erv'd and unprevented, endure tho&s;e Sufferings needful for our Redemption: For He mu&s;t be <HI>numbered among Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors,</HI> i. e. Publickly condemned as a Ma e&s;actor, and offer'd up a Sacrifice to Death even the mo&s;t cur&s;ed painful and ignominious Death, which was that of <HI>the Cro&s;s:</HI> and it the People among whom He &s;ojourn'd had but known Him to be <HI>the Lord of Glory,</HI> they had never crucified Him. 1 Cor. II. 8.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004067_0023_1003C2AF04E1B9B0">
Till He arriv'd to about 30 <HI>Years of Age,</HI> He livid a low, retir'd and &s;ervile, tho' &s;potle&s;s Life; and then engag'd in his Publick Mi|ni&s;try: At his Entrance, He overcame the Tempter in his mo&s;t &s;ubtil, &s;trong and a&s;&s;iduous Efforts; and then He went about con|tinually doing Good: Preaching the glad Tidings of Redemption teaching heavenly &amp; &s;aving Doctrines, confirming them with Mira|cles, adorning them with a mo&s;t divine &amp; perfect Life; healing all manner of Di&s;ea&s;es, forgiving Sins, ruling the Winds and Seas, con|trolling the Power of Devils, making them to wor&s;hip Him, turn|ing them out of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and &s;ending them away.</P>
<P>By &s;uch things as the&s;e He gave the growing Specimens of his &s;uperior Power to tho&s;e our mighty and de&s;troying Enemies. But He advances in his Triumphs. For a little before He left the World, He <HI>began to aboli&s;h Death it &s;elf,</HI> by rai&s;ing the Son of the Wi|dow of <HI>Nain,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Jairus,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Lazarus</HI> to Life. To the Two former, He only &s;ays, <HI>I &s;ay unto Thee ari&s;e,</HI> and they im|mediately aro&s;e. To the la&s;t, at the Mouth of the Tomb wherein he had lain for 4 Days among the Dead, He cries &mdash; <HI>Lazarus come forth,</HI> and out he comes with the Grave-Cloaths bound about him.</P>
<P>But to compleat the Conque&s;t, and become more Glorious, He mu&s;t conde&s;cend to Die; that for us He might intirely fulfill the Law, brake the Power of Satan, Sin and Death among the Sons of Men, purcha&s;e our compleat Redemption, and ri&s;e a perfect Con|queror and Deliverer. For if He cou'd rai&s;e Him&s;elf to Life; He wou'd obtain a perfect Victory, both for HIMSELF and <HI>us,</HI> and all things el&s;e wou'd be ea&s;y to Him. For as the Apo&s;tle argues; Heb II. 10, 14, 15. <HI>It became Him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many Sons to Glory, to make the</HI> CAPTAIN OF THEIR SALVATION <HI>perfect through Sufferings.</HI> &mdash; And, <HI>Fora&s;much as
<PB N="23" REF="004067_0024_1003A1796AD22880">the Children are Partakers of Fle&s;h and Blood;</HI> HE <HI>al&s;o Him&s;elf likewi&s;e took part of the &s;ame: that through Death, He might de&s;troy Him who had the Power of Death, i. e. the Devil; and Deliver them who through Fear of Death, were all their Life Time &s;ubject to Bondage.</HI></P>
<P>Having therefore fulfilled all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, endured every kind of &s;inle&s;s Suffering both in Soul and Body, and Fini&s;hed the Work for which He was &s;ent among us; He &s;ubmitted to be <HI>Crucified, Kill'd</HI> and <HI>Buried.</HI> But on the <HI>&s;ame Day,</HI> his &s;eparate <HI>Soul</HI> enter'd into the Joys of Paradice; and on the <HI>Third Day</HI> after, He aboli&s;h'd Death in his &s;lain <HI>Body,</HI> by awaking unto Life and ri&s;ing from the Grave. At the &s;ame time, He &s;hook the Earth, opened the Graves of many others round about Him, enlivened and rais'd them with Him&s;elf: And in 40 <HI>Days,</HI> He in the Sight of his Di&s;ciples, a&s;cend|ed up on high, and led Captivity Captive: Having &s;poiled the Principalities and Powers of Darkne&s;s; He made a &s;hew of them openly, triumphing over them. Being rai&s;ed to Heaven, He is there placed at the Right Hand of GOD, far above all Principality and Power and Might and Dominion, and every Name that is na|med not only in this World, but al&s;o in that which is to come; having all things put under his Feet, and being the <HI>Head</HI> over them for the Good of his People. He is exalted to be a <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Sa|viour,</HI> to give Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins: And is become the <HI>Author</HI> of Eternal Salvation to all that obey Him.</P>
<P>For all this He did, as a <HI>Publick Per&s;on,</HI> in behalf of all his Fol|lowers; and as a vi&s;ible and certain Demon&s;tration, that He had <HI>purcha&s;ed,</HI> and is both <HI>able</HI> and <HI>re&s;olved</HI> to <HI>accompli&s;h</HI> their ab&s;olute Deliverance from all their Enemies, has begun to brake their Powers, will intirely take away his People's Sin which is the Sting of Death, at the Moment of their Di&s;&s;olution, receive their puri|fied

<P>This therefore brings us in the</P>
<P N="4">IV. and la&s;t Place, To take a Pro&s;pect of that LIFE and IM|MORTALITY, which He then <HI>bro't to Light,</HI> and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively di&s;|covers by the Go&s;pel Revelation.</P>
<P>Now by <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Immortality,</HI> the Apo&s;tle doubtle&s;s means the &s;ame thing, with this only Difference; that LIFE implies the <HI>Kind</HI> of our Exi&s;tence in the Future World, as being a State of active Powers, Perceptions and Enjoyments; IMMORTALITY the <HI>never failing Duration</HI> of it; and <HI>both together</HI> repre&s;ent a State of perfect and endle&s;s Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Word <GAP DESC="foreign"> indeed originally &s;ignifies INCORRUPTI|BILITY: but yet it &s;eems to be u&s;ed indifferently, both for <HI>Incor|ruptibility</HI> and <HI>Immortality,</HI> both by <HI>this Apo&s;tle</HI> and by <HI>Profane Writers.</HI> For every vital thing that is Incorruptible, mu&s;t in its Nature be Immortal: and in both the&s;e Sen&s;es our Tran&s;lators u&s;e it. In 1 Cor. XV. 42, 50, 52, 53, and 54, it is therefore rendered <HI>Incorrup|tion:</HI> and in Rom II. 7, as well as in our Text by <HI>Immortality.</HI> So in Rom. 1.23, we read of the <HI>Incorruptible God</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> and in 1 Tim. 1.17, the &s;ame Word is us'd for the <HI>King Immortal.</HI> Agrea|ble to this, I ob&s;erve <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> repre&s;enting the Opinion of the <HI>Sad|duces, E&s;&s;ecus</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> in the Places above recited, indifferent|ly u&s;es the Words <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, to &s;ignify the Soul's <HI>Immortality.</HI> And agreably we have the &s;ame Word in our Text, thus beautifully rendered in the <HI>Book of Wi&s;dom,</HI> Chap. II. v. 23.
<PB N="25" REF="004067_0026_1003C2BAD6379B58"><HI>For</HI> GOD <HI>created Man to be</HI> IMMORTAL,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> <HI>and made Him to be an Image of his own Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>But then this <HI>Immortality</HI> &s;eems plainly to re&s;pect the <HI>Soul,</HI> as well as <HI>Body:</HI> and not only to look on forward to the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Body,</HI> which the <HI>Heathen</HI> had no Tho't of, and which the <HI>Jews</HI> di&s;puted; but even nearer and immediately to the <HI>Soul</HI> it&s;elf, <HI>in the &s;tate of Separation,</HI> which a few of Both had &s;ome Glimps of, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired.</P>
<P>And that the Apo&s;tle had this nearer Pro&s;pect, appears from the&s;e 4 Rea&s;ons &mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Becau&s;e by many Pa&s;&s;ages in his Writings, it appears He had been both a <HI>Platoni&s;t</HI> in Philo&s;ophy and a <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> in Divinity, and retain'd &s;o much of their be&s;t Principles as was con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Chri&s;tian Revelation.</HI> And as he knew that by <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Immortality,</HI> they to be &s;ure included the Life of the <HI>Soul</HI> in its <HI>&s;eparate State,</HI> and He had been accu&s;tom'd to u&s;e the Words in the &s;ame View; He mu&s;t &s;till have the &s;ame View in his pre&s;ent u&s;ing them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Becau&s;e He knew that the <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of Life and Happine&s;s in every State is equally co-natural to the fore&s;eeing Mind of Man; the De&s;ire of a happy Living in the pre&s;ent World, the De&s;ire of the Continuance of &s;uch a happy Living, and the De&s;ire al&s;o of Life and Happine&s;s in the State of Separation; that the be&s;t of Men both among the <HI>Heathen, Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> could not but earne&s;tly De&s;ire it; and that the Sy&s;tem of the GOSPEL mu&s;t needs excell the Doctrines of <HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Plato,</HI> both as to the great Ob|jects
<PB N="26" REF="004067_0027_1003C2C21E2842B8">of our natural and rational De&s;ires, and the Certainty of their Di&s;covery.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Becau&s;e he knew that our BLESSED SAVIOUR at his late Ap|pearing had <HI>brought to Light</HI> the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Immortality</HI> of the humane <HI>Soul</HI> in its <HI>State of Separation.</HI>
<P>For in <HI>Mat.</HI> X. 28 He had plainly &s;aid, that tho&s;e who cou'd kill the <HI>Body,</HI> were not able to kill the <HI>Soul.</HI> In the <HI>Parable</HI> of the <HI>Rich Man</HI> and <HI>Lazarus,</HI> He repre&s;ents the <HI>Body</HI> of the <HI>Rich Man</HI> as Dead and Buried, but his <HI>Soul</HI> in Hell, and de&s;iring that his &s;urviving Brethren on Earth might be warn'd of coming into his Place of Torment: And at the &s;ame time, that <HI>Lazarus</HI> was carried by Angels to <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Embraces, and There was comforted, while the decea&s;ed Spirit of the Rich Man was tormented. <HI>Luke</HI> XVI.</P>
<P>In his <HI>Argument</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Sadducees;</HI> who neither believ'd the Re&s;urrection, Angels, Spirits, nor the Soul's Immortality &mdash; He ob&s;erves that GOD cannot be &s;o properly the GOD of the <HI>Dead</HI> as of the <HI>Living:</HI> and that continuing to call Him&s;elf the GOD of <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacch</HI> after their Decea&s;e; He plainly intimates, that in their vital Parts their <HI>Souls,</HI> they were &s;till <HI>alive</HI> and happy in Him, tho' waiting in full A&s;&s;urance of the Re&s;urrection of their Bodies. <HI>Luke</HI> XX. 27, 40.</P>

<P>As He hung <HI>upon the Cro&s;s,</HI> he declared there was then a <HI>Paradice,</HI> a Place of Happine&s;s, &s;uitable for the Re&s;idence of the &s;eparate Spi|rits of the &s;anctified; into which He would on the &s;ame Day en|ter, and the believing Malefactor dying with Him.

<PB REF="004067_0043_1003C267A94FB6D0">the principal Gentlewomen in Town; after whom went the Gen|tlemen of His Maje&s;ty's Council; the Rev Mini&s;ters of this and the neighbouring Towns; the Rev. Pre&s;ident and Fellows of <HI>Harvard-College;</HI> a great Number of Officers, both of the civil and military Order, with a multitude of other Gentlemen. His Excellency's Coach, drawn by four Hor&s;es, was cover'd with black Cloth and adorn'd with E&s;cutcheons of the Coat of Arms, both of His Excel|lency and His decea&s;ed Lady. All the Bells in Town were tolled on this mournful Occa&s;ion; and during the Time of the Funeral Proce&s;&s;ion to the Tomb, the Half-Minute Guns began fir&s;t at His Maje&s;ty's Ca&s;tle <HI>William,</HI> which were follow'd by tho&s;e on board His Maje&s;ty's Ship <HI>Squirrel</HI> and many other Ships in the Harbour, their Colours being all Day rais'd to the heighth as u&s;ual on &s;uch Occa&s;ions: The Streets thro' which the Funeral pa&s;s'd, the Tops of the Hou&s;es and Windows on both &s;ides, were crouded with in|numerable Spectators.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 21.</P>
<P>La&s;t Lord's Day a Funeral Sermon was preach'd by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Prince,</HI> on Account of the Decea&s;e of the Lady of his Excellency our Governour, from 2 Tim. 1. 10. &mdash; <HI>Who hath aboli&s;hed Death, and hath brought Life and Immortality to Light by the Go&s;pel.</HI> His Excellency's Pew, and the Pulpit, were upon this Occa&s;ion, put into Mourn|ing, and richly adorn'd with E&s;cutcheons.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>DELCHER</HI> was Daughter to the late Hon. <HI>William Partridge,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who was &s;everal Years Lieut Governour &amp; Comman|der in Chief, in and over the Province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> ha|ving his Commi&s;&s;ion from the late King WILLIAM the Third. Her Education in every Female Accompli&s;hment was the be&s;t Her Countrey could give: which with her great Per&s;onal Beauties, &s;oon recommended her to the Addr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;les of Mr <HI>BELCHER,</HI> our pre|&s;ent Governour, to whom &s;he was Married <HI>Jan.</HI> 4.1705, 6.</P>
<P>As Providence had placed her at the Head of her Sex in her own Countrey, &s;he graced her Station with all the Elegance of Good Manners and Affable Conde&s;cention. She was of a &s;prightly Tem|per: But always grave &amp; &s;olemn in Affairs of Religion. Her Bible was her principal Study, which &s;he us'd to read through in Cour&s;e &s;everal Times a Year. Tho' &s;he ever lived in the Splendour of a Gentlewoman; in her Oeconomy, it was her con&s;tant Maxim, <HI>Let nothing be lo&s;t.</HI> The Poor can Witne&s;s to the Compa&s;&s;ions of her Heart, &amp; the Largene&s;s of her Munificence. The Terrors of Death long kept her in Bondage; but at la&s;t &s;eem'd entirely vani&s;hed, and &s;he expir'd in much Serenity, on the 6th in&s;tant.</P>
