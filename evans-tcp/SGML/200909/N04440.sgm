<Q><BIBL><HI>1 THESSALONIANS iv. 11.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And that ye &s;tudy to be quiet, and to do your own Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle in the&s;e Words exhorts the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> to two important and difficult Duties, <HI>viz. Quietne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Diligence</HI> in their own Bu&s;ine&s;s. By being <HI>Quiet</HI> we are to under&s;tand a meek and peaceable Temper and Behaviour, which is oppos'd to a turbulent and wrangling Spirit, to &s;inful and needle&s;s Con|tentions about civil or religious Matters; all that tumultuous Behaviour is hereby forbid, whereby the Right of others is unju&s;tly in|fring'd, and their Peace cau&s;ele&s;sly di&s;turb'd.</P>
<P>Now the Apo&s;tle exhorts them to <HI>&s;tudy</HI> to be quiet. The original Word tran&s;lated <HI>Study,</HI> &s;ignifies to be Ambitious, to inti|mate that we &s;hould pur&s;ue Quiet with the like Degree of E&s;teem, De&s;ire and La|bour, as Men do Honour, Dignity and Pow|er, which are the Objects of Ambition. <HI>Study to be quiet,</HI> i. e. often think on the
<PB N="4" REF="005498_0003_10183FFEB82AAD68">
Value and Importance of it, endeavour to find out, ponder upon, and pur&s;ue after the Mea&s;ures that are nece&s;&s;ary to attain and pre&s;erve it. Me thinks the Apo&s;tles Exhorta|tion plainly &s;peaks the Nece&s;&s;ity, the Diffi|culty, and Excellency of Quiet. It is nece&s;|&s;ary upon many Accounts to be calm and compos'd, meek and peaceful, as I &s;hall af|terwards labour to evince. It is al&s;o a no|ble Temper of Mind which de&s;erves our Study and Care, and indeed it is as difficult to be attain'd and maintain'd as it is nece&s;&s;a|ry and excellent, becau&s;e of the many Inci|dents and Temptations we meet with in this World, which are apt to put our Pa&s;&s;i|ons into an irregular Ferment, and call forth our angry Re&s;entments before we are aware.</P>
<P>The next Duty the Apo&s;tle recommends is <HI>Diligence</HI> in our proper Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>do your own Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> as if he &s;hould &s;ay, manage Things that are proper for you, things that are &s;uitable to your Capacity and Character, things you have a call to negociate, and do not needle&s;sly intermedle in others Affairs to the prejudice of their Quiet.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle pre&s;cribes Diligence in our own Bu&s;ine&s;s as an excellent Mean to pro|mote
<PB N="5" REF="005498_0004_10184000A6A616B8">
Peace and Quiet. And indeed &s;o it is, for if People were as diligent as they &s;hould be in managing their own Affairs with Di&s;cretion, they would find little Lea&s;ure or Inclination to enter upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s of others that dont belong to them, without either Invitation or Nece&s;&s;ity, and then act the Part of a &s;evere Critick, a &s;our Saty|ri&s;t, or imperious Judge.</P>
<P>Contention certainly often &s;prings from a needle&s;s and imperious intermedling with the Bu&s;ine&s;s of others. This the Apo&s;tle &s;harply reproves the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> for in his &s;econd Epi&s;tle to them iii. <HI>Chap.</HI> 11, and 12 <HI>Ver. For we hear</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that there are &s;ome who walk among you di&s;orderly, work|ing not at all but are Bu&s;y-bodies. Now them that are &s;uch, we command and exhort by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that with Quietne&s;s they work and eat their own Bread.</HI> The <HI>Greek</HI> Word tran&s;lated <HI>walking among,</HI> in the preceeding Ver&s;e, &s;ignifies to go round about. It &s;eems there were &s;ome idle People among the <HI>The&s;alonians,</HI> who went round about from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e making Mi&s;chief, by their tatling and intermedling with other Peoples Affairs. The Apo&s;tle deals roundly
<PB N="6" REF="005498_0005_10184003A32479A8">
with tho&s;e Pe&s;ts of Society, and &s;olemnly exhorts them to Diligence and Quiet.</P>
<P>It is true to &s;eek our own Things only, is a great evil, and as &s;uch the &s;ame Apo&s;tle bewails it, Phil. ii. 21. <HI>All &s;eek their own and not the Things that are</HI> JESUS CHRIST'S. When we are call'd to it no doubt we &s;hould concern our&s;elves with the Affairs of others, but not otherwi&s;e, and then we may reckon them our own. Hence it is the Apo&s;tle el&s;ewhere ob&s;erves, <HI>that we &s;hould not only &s;eek our own, but every Man anothers Wealth,</HI> i. e. We &s;hould not only avoid building our own Intere&s;t upon the Ruin of another Mans, which is as natural and com|mon as it is cruel and malignant; but we &s;hould, when called thereto, endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t others in promoting their temporal In|tere&s;t as far as we have Opportunity and Capacity.</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing farther upon our Text, I &s;hall

<ITEM>II. <HI>Of the Evil imply'd,</HI> viz. <HI>medling in other folks Bu&s;ine&s;s without a Call.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Point therefore to be con&s;idered is, <HI>Quietne&s;s. Study to be quiet.</HI> In &s;peak|ing
<PB N="7" REF="005498_0006_10184005615F1F10">
upon which, I &s;hall 1&s;t. Point to the Hindrances of it. 2d. Repre&s;ent the Means which are needful to acquire and pre&s;erve it. 3d. Shew the Excellency and Importance of &s;uch a temper of Mind and Behaviour.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. I am to <HI>point out the Hinderances of quiet, which &s;hould be avoided.</HI> Now they are the&s;e following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Pride, high and overweening Con|ceits of our&s;elves, when we imagine that we are much wi&s;er, and much better than we are, and of greater Importance in the World. This inclines us to de&s;pi&s;e others, who are perhaps our Superiors in real worth This makes us impatient of Contradiction, and di&s;po&s;es Per&s;ons to a&s;&s;ume a magi&s;terial Air in their Behaviour, u&s;urping an Atho|rity over others which they have no right to. This Evil the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> cauti|ons again&s;t in the 3d. Chap. of his Book, and 1&s;t. and 2d. Ver&s;es. <HI>My Brethren be not many Ma&s;ters, knowing that we &s;hall receive the greater Condemnation; for in many Things we offend All.</HI> Now to get the Pride of our Hearts broken, let us con&s;ider for God's &s;ake how unrea&s;onable and dangerous it is. Pray what Cau&s;e has any Man living to be
<PB N="8" REF="005498_0007_1018400D23147030">
Proud? who con&s;iders the Meanne&s;s of his Original, the Tran&s;itorine&s;s of his Abode upon the Stage of Time, together with the &s;trict Account he mu&s;t give of his pre|&s;ent Steward&s;hip at la&s;t. before God's en|lightned Tribunal? Have we not &s;prung from degenerate Parents? (&s;urely our Father was an <HI>Amorite</HI> and our Mother a <HI>Hitite.</HI>) Are we not &s;inful and dependant Creatures, liable to a thou&s;and Accidents, and ha&s;ting fa&s;t on the Torrent of Time to the Grave: (the Place appointed for all living.) In which, after a few Moments expire, we mu&s;t be reduc'd to Du&s;t and Rottenne&s;s, and ex|pos'd to Oblivion? What if any of us have Gifts, natural, acquir'd or Gracious, do not the&s;e put us more in Debt to God, from whom we receive them? And &s;hall we be proud of our Debts? What is there in the Honours of this World that can rea&s;onably incite our Arrogance? Can they confer any real worth? No, &s;urely; they are more likely to dimini&s;h any Thing that is prai&s;e worthy in us, by flattering our Pride. And are they not as variable as the Wind: Are not Prai&s;e and Di&s;prai&s;e (generally) rather the Fruits of Humour, Affection or Prejudice, than
<PB N="9" REF="005498_0008_1018400F19B4A488">
the Re&s;ult of a Sober Judgment? As to &s;en|&s;itive Plea&s;ures are they not Common to us with the Bruits? Do they not die in the Enjoyment, and if &s;inful are they not fol|low'd with a Remor&s;e which exceeds in Bitterne&s;s the Comfort they yield? As to Wealth it can neither make us Good or Happy, it often flies from our Embraces, but can never content our Minds, being of a gro&s;s and limitted Nature; but becau&s;e &s;ome are proud of their Knowledge it &s;hould be remembred, that unle&s;s it be &s;anctify'd it makes us but more like the Devils who are knowing, but wicked, Spirits: <HI>Surely he that knows his Ma&s;ters Will, and does not perform it, &s;hall be beaten with double Stripes!</HI> And &s;hall any who have obtain'd the free Grace of God boa&s;t as tho' they had not re|ceiv'd it, and &s;acrifice to their own Nett? O how Mon&s;trous and Incon&s;i&s;tent is this! Dear Sirs, con&s;ider that God re&s;i&s;ts the Proud, and gives Grace to the Humble. <HI>Surely Pride goes before De&s;truction, and a high Mind before a Fall.</HI> But</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Another Hindrance of <HI>Quiet</HI> is En|mity again&s;t our Brother, which inclines Men to hard Thoughts, hard Speeches, as
<PB N="10" REF="005498_0009_10184010D1A56CF0">
well as to unju&s;t and ungenerous Actions. Unrea&s;onable Jealou&s;es, ra&s;h judging of the States of others, becau&s;e of their Difference in Sentiment about le&s;&s;er Things in Reli|gion, or &s;uch Infirmities in Practice as may (agreeable to Scripture In&s;tances) con&s;i&s;t with a gracious State, are of dreadfull Ten|dency to de&s;troy the Peace and Quiet of Societys. Whatever Fears we have con|corning the States of others towards God they &s;hould not be expre&s;s'd, unle&s;s &s;ome valuable End can be thereby an&s;wer'd; o|therwi&s;e I &s;ee not how &s;uch a proceeding can be clear'd of the Charge of Back-biting. It is lamentable to think how ready &s;ome ignorant Novices in Religion, are to take the Bench, and pronounce Sentence again&s;t the Spiritual States of others ra&s;hly, and with|out &s;ufficient Foundation; but &s;uch Per&s;ons are generally paid in their own Coin before they leave the World; agreeable to the De|claration of our Lord, <HI>Mat.</HI> vii. 1.2. Such as are mo&s;t enclin'd to enter upon the difficult Province of judging, concerning the States of others, are generally lea&s;t fit for it. The longer Gracious Per&s;ons live, and the more they know of the Deceits
<PB N="11" REF="005498_0010_101840154703CE90">
of their own Hearts, the more &s;en&s;ible they will be of their unfitne&s;s to judge of the States of others, and the le&s;s inclin'd they will be to it. I may farther ob&s;erve that all the Sins of the Tongue, particularly Slan|der and Detraction, are Hindrances to quiet, and as &s;uch ought to be avoided.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Another Hindrance of Quiet is, taking up evil reports again&s;t our Brethren without &s;ufficient Evidence, and &s;preading of them with Delight; both which are expre&s;ly forbid by the Almighty, <HI>P&s;a.</HI> xv. 3. <HI>Lev.</HI> xix. 16. <HI>Thou &s;halt not go up and down as a Tale bearer among thy People: We &s;hould be as tender of our Neighbours good Name, as of his Body and E&s;tate,</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. It likewi&s;e mars Quiet when Per|&s;ons rigorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t upon their civil Right in &s;mall Matters; the lo&s;s of which they can endure without much injury to them&s;elves or Families. This the Apo&s;tle reproved the <HI>Corinthians</HI> for, 1 Cor. vi. 7. <HI>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you becau&s;e ye go to Law one with another; why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather &s;uffer your &s;elves to be defrauded?</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="12" REF="005498_0011_101840172659C790">5thly. Another Hindrance is angry Re|&s;entments, or Revenges for real and &s;uppos'd Injuries, doing Evil for Evil, and rendering Reviling for Reviling. O Sirs, was this the Practice of Chri&s;t? Or is it agreeable to his Religion? Shall we profe&s;s the Name of Chri&s;t, and yet come &s;hort of the Good Temper that appear'd in &s;ome of the Pagans. I have read of one whom his Neighbour revil'd all Day, to whom he made no reply till the Evening came on, when it was Time for his Neighbour to go Home, he then &s;poke to him in the following Strain: <HI>Neighbour,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;hall my Man light you Home?</HI> It is likewi&s;e &s;toried of <HI>Socrates,</HI> that once when he was attempting to beat his Servant, but finding him&s;elf Angry, he held out his Arm for a con&s;iderable Time, as a Puni&s;hment upon him&s;elf, without &s;triking a Blow, and told his Servant that <HI>he would beat him but that he was Angry.</HI> Sirs if we are habitually bent on Revenge, what will our Profe&s;&s;ion avail us? What do we more then others, yea the very wor&s;t of Men? But to proceed,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Means conducive to Quiet are the&s;e following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="13" REF="005498_0012_10184019167511B8">1&s;t. A humble Mind. We are com|manded to be cloth'd with Humility; and truly this is one of the noble&s;t Ornaments, without which we are naked and deform'd: To pre&s;erve which it is needful to take a frequent View of the Plague Sore of our Hearts, as well as of our Blunders in Prac|ti&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Another excellent Mean to pro|mote Quiet, is Love to our Neighbour. This will di&s;po&s;e us to kind Thoughts, courteous Speeches, ju&s;t and generous Ac|tions. <HI>Charity or Love,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, 1 Cor. 13. <HI>thinketh no Evil, it believes all Things and hopes all Things, i. e.</HI> Tho&s;e that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it are thereby inclin'd to the mo&s;t favourable Sentiments of the Speeches and Actions of others, that their Nature and Circum&s;tances can i Rea|&s;on admit of, &s;o that it is no Sign of the Depth of our Judgment to be &s;evere and cen&s;orious, but of the Weakne&s;s or Want of Charity. The Apo&s;tle farther ob&s;erves in the forecited Chapter, That Cha|rity &s;uffereth Long, and is Kind, That Charity is not ea&s;ily provok'd, and rejoyceth not in Iniquity: Such as are endu'd with it,
<PB N="14" REF="005498_0013_1018401CEE8F1140">
are not pleas'd at their Neighbours mi&s;car|riages. Surely that Wi&s;dom that is from above is fir&s;t Pure, then peaceable, gentle and ea&s;ie to be entreated, without Partia|lity and without Hypocri&s;y. I may add that real Love con&s;i&s;ts not in Word and Tongue only, but expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf in Deed and in Truth. As Ju&s;tice and Genero&s;ity directly tend to Quiet, &s;o the Contrary thereof are fatal Sources of Di&s;cord and Debate: The Practice of Inju&s;tice, under a religious Ma&s;k, is &s;o big with Maligni|ty and Mi&s;chief, that no Words or Co|lours can &s;ufficiently repre&s;ent it!</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Another Mean of Quiet, is to bear with the Weakne&s;&s;es of our Brethren, <HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 1.2&punc; <HI>Brethren if any Man be over|taken in a Fault, ye which are &s;piritual re&s;tore &s;uch a one, in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s, con&s;idering thy &s;elf lea&s;t thou al&s;o be tempted. Bear ye one anothers Burthens,</HI> &s;aith the A|po&s;tle el&s;ewhere, <HI>and &s;o fulfil the Law of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. Another Mean of Quiet, is a &s;peedy forgiving of Injuries: And hence we are forbid <HI>to let the Sun go down on our Wrath,</HI> and enjoyn'd in Ca&s;e <HI>we have brought
<PB N="15" REF="005498_0014_1018402531C7CE10">
our Gift to the Altar, and remember that our Brother hath ought again&s;t us, to leave there our Gift, and be fir&s;t reconcil'd to our Brother, Mat.</HI> v. 23.24. And indeed without forgiving tho&s;e that Tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us, we cannot pray the Lords Prayer without virtually praying for a Cur&s;e upon our&s;elves.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. If we de&s;ire Quiet, our Words &s;hould be few, James i. 19. <HI>Wherefore my beloved Brethren, let every Man be &s;wift to hear, &s;low to &s;peak, &s;low to Wrath: For in a Multitude of Words, there wanteth not Sin, but he that refraineth his Lips is Wi&s;e, Pro.</HI> x. 19 And el&s;ewhere <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, That <HI>he that hath Knowledge &s;par|eth his Words. Pro.</HI> xvii. 37. It is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to allow Per&s;ons their Liberty of &s;peaking out what they have to &s;ay, with|out Interruption: The Contrary hereof, namely teaching and dictating in common Conver&s;ation, where we have no Authority, and interrupting others in their Di&s;cour&s;e, are very offen&s;ive, they argue Vanity of Mind, and involve in them a Kind of Per&s;ecution and robbing Mankind of that Priviledge which they have a right to by the
<PB N="16" REF="005498_0015_10184028AD027600">
Laws of Society. And here I cannot but take Notice of another Practice which is e|qually offen&s;ive to mode&s;t and humble Minds, viz. <HI>prai&s;ing of Per&s;ons in their Pre|&s;ence.</HI> It is grievous in ones hearing to be &s;et upon the Stage, and made an object either of Commendation, or Sport and Ridicule.</P>
<P>But I proceed to &s;hew <HI>the Excellency and Importance of a quiet Temper and Behaviour,</HI> which appear from the following Con&s;i|derations, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. A quiet temper of Mind is plea&s;ing to God, <HI>A meek and quiet Spirit is in the &s;ight of God of great Price,</HI> 1 Pet iii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is ornamental to Religion, when tho&s;e that profe&s;s CHRIST imitate his Ex|ample, <HI>and learn of him to be meek and lowly.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. It is many Ways profitable to our &s;elves; this is the Way to obtain the Ble&s;|&s;ing of God upon our Per&s;ons and Enjoy|ments. Mat. v. 5. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Meek for they &s;hall inherit the Earth.</HI> Tho' they may have but little of the World, yet they &s;hall have the Comfort and Reli&s;h of what they po&s;&s;e&s;s. A quiet Behaviour tends to pre&s;erve the Tranquility of our own Minds,
<PB N="17" REF="005498_0016_1018402AEA53A9B0">
for he that does not come in anothers Way is like to be let alone him&s;elf: But the Bu&s;y-Body creates Trouble to him&s;elf, for others will be as apt to cen&s;ure his Proceedings as he is theirs. And hence the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> advi&s;eth to beware of <HI>Suffering as a Thief, Murderer or Bu&s;y-Body in other Mens Mat|ters,</HI> 1 Pet. iv. 15. And <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves ju&s;tly, Pro. xxvi. 17. <HI>That he that pa&s;&s;eth by and medleth with Strife, belongeth not to him, is like one that taketh a Dog by the Ears,</HI> which its difficult to do, when they are Quarrelling, without being bit.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Quietne&s;s is profitable to others, it pre&s;erves the general Order of Things, and keeps Men within their proper Ranks and Spheres, and thus it is the Guardian of Concord and Amity; for no Man is hereby provok'd or rob'd of his ju&s;t Liberty of thinking and acting for him&s;elf: And &s;urely &s;uch as are well inclin'd towards us. are mo&s;t like to receive Good by our Councils and Examples, O! therefore <HI>let us &s;tudy to be Quiet.</HI> Our Lord has recommended this Virtue by his own Example, <HI>he was led as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep
<PB N="18" REF="005498_0017_1018402C9EDA0688">
before the Shearers is dumb, &s;o he opened not his Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>And truly a <HI>meek and quiet</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition is in it&s;elf a noble Atcheivement, as <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>He that is &s;low to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City.</HI> This oppo&s;es Tumult and Arrogance, and all that unkind u&s;age which &s;prings from Pa&s;&s;ion and Preju|dice. This is fitted to every honourable Purpo&s;e of human Life, and adorns every valuable Character in it. This checks the Pride of the Rich, and the Envy of the Poor. This di&s;po&s;es Superiors to temper their Rule with Di&s;cretion and Tenderne&s;s, and teaches Inferiors Reverence and Submi&s;|&s;ion. By this younger Per&s;ons are inclin'd to give Place to their Seniors, and ri&s;e up be|fore the hoary Head!</P>
<P>Surely as <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>He who is &s;low to anger is of great Under&s;tanding, but be that is ha&s;ty of Spirit exalteth folly.</HI> What agonies of Mind and extravagancies of Be|haviour does ra&s;h Anger plunge its unhappy Votaries into? whereby they become Ob|jects of pity or contempt!</P>
<P>When this pre&s;ent tran&s;itory Scene of
<PB N="19" REF="005498_0018_1018402EF2387DB8">
Things has come to its final Period, how di&s;mal will be the Ca&s;e of the Envious? Then they &s;hall be con&s;ign'd to a perpetual abode with Spirits of their own Complection, there to wa&s;te a whole Eternity in uncea&s;ing Jars and Conte&s;ts! While in the mean time the Sons of Peace and Quiet, &s;hall be re|ceiv'd into the Regions of perfect, endle&s;s Love, and embrac'd in the Bo&s;om of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, who in our Nature, has &s;et us an Example of this noble Vertue, that we might follow his Steps.</P>
<P>But the Second Duty recommended by the Words of our Text, <HI>is Diligence in our own Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> And <HI>to do your own Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> Here let us enquire 1&s;t. What Bu&s;ine&s;s we have to do? 2d. How it &s;hould be done? And 3d. Why?</P>
<P>Now the Bu&s;ine&s;s we have to do is two-fold, namely, of our <HI>general</HI> and <HI>particular</HI> Calling. The former concerns us as Chri&s;|tians, the latter as Members of a Commu|nity; as &s;uch we &s;hould have &s;ome Office Civil or Religious, which may profit Man|kind; the Duties of which we &s;hould con|&s;cientiou&s;ly perform. It is a ba&s;e Thing to live like a Drone upon the Fruits of others
<PB N="20" REF="005498_0019_101840328E7E6B30">
Labours, without doing any Thing for our Support, while we have a Capacity!</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of our <HI>general Calling,</HI> which is to &s;ecure the Salvation of our Souls, &s;hould be done in the following Manner, viz. <HI>early, earne&s;tly, humbly, regularly, per&s;eve|ringly.</HI> And hence our Lord enjoins us, <HI>to &s;eek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God&mdash;and to &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate.</HI> And hence it is that he pronounces a Ble&s;&s;ing up|on <HI>the poor in Spirit,</HI> and a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>that theirs is the Kingdom of God.</HI> Whatever carne&s;tne&s;s we have in Religion, yet if we depend upon it as Meritorious, we are like to loo&s;e our labour; <HI>for tho&s;e that &s;eek Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s as it were by the Works of the Law, &s;hall not obtain it.</HI> Moreover if we do not begin at the right End of Religion, and try to lay the Foundation fir&s;t, by &s;eeking a Change of the State and of the Heart, by Ju&s;tification and Conver&s;ion, in order to the Super&s;tructure of a good Life, our Endea|vours are vain and to no purpo&s;e, but to deceive our own Souls! We &s;hould likewi&s;e Remember, that Per&s;everance in Goodne&s;s mu&s;t Crown the Scene, or certain ruin will en&s;ue. It is only &s;uch as per&s;evere to the
<PB N="21" REF="005498_0020_10184039AA078968">
End that &s;hall be &s;aved; and hence we are commanded <HI>to work out the Work of our Sal|vation with fear and trembling.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our <HI>particular Cal|ling,</HI> it &s;hould be done with <HI>Di&s;cretion</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> P&s;al, cxii 5. With <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> and <HI>Courage,</HI> (if we be &s;car'd at every Cloud we &s;hall neither &s;ow nor reap) with <HI>earne&s;t Application;</HI> whatever our Hand finds to do, we &s;hould do it with all our might. Again, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our <HI>particular Calling</HI> &s;hould be done with <HI>humble Dependance</HI> upon Gods Providence for Succe&s;s, with <HI>chearful Re&s;ignation</HI> to his <HI>Will,</HI> with <HI>thankful Ac|knowledgment</HI> for his Mercy in &s;miling upon our <HI>E&s;&s;ays,</HI> without which they are all abortive. It is an In&s;tance of great Impiety and Ingratitude to &s;acrifice to our own Net, and to &s;uffer our <HI>particular Calling</HI> thro' our mi&s;management to hinder our <HI>general.</HI></P>
<P>Woe to tho&s;e that po&s;tpone the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their <HI>general Calling</HI> from time to time; that have that ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary Work to begin, when the Day of Life is expiring! O Bretheren! wherefore do ye &s;tand all the Day Idle? Have ye not Work to do of the mo&s;t noble and important kind? And have
<PB N="22" REF="005498_0021_1018403B84734070">
ye not been often call'd in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Strains, by a variety of God's faithful Me&s;|&s;engers to the Performance of it? Is not God the be&s;t of Ma&s;ters? And is not the Reward of Grace he propo&s;es &s;o great and glorious as may ju&s;tly excite your mo&s;t in|ten&s;e De&s;ire and vehement Labours? O Sirs! what apology can ye frame for your &s;tupid indifference and &s;ordid Negligence, re&s;pect|ing &s;uch Matters of infinite and inexpre&s;&s;ible Moment?</P>
<P>But becau&s;e our Text e&s;pecially recom|mends Diligence in temporal Bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;hall therefore more generally repre&s;ent its Excellencies and Advantages, which contain the Rea&s;ons <HI>why we &s;hould do our own Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Here ob&s;erve that Diligence is the guard of Virtue; it keeps off tho&s;e Temptations which otherwi&s;e would en&s;nare us: An aw|ful Example of this we have in <HI>David</HI> who by loytering on the Hou&s;e top, when he &s;hould have been at the head of his Army, was en&s;nar'd to the great &s;candal of Religion. But on the Contrary, when a Per&s;on is bu|&s;ied about his lawful Employment, his Mind is engaged, and &s;o wants lei&s;ure to daly with tempting Objects; and being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of
<PB N="23" REF="005498_0022_1018403D37AABB80">
hone&s;t Amu&s;ements, has no room for ba&s;e De&s;igns. In particular, Diligence is a Pre|&s;ervative from vain Curio&s;ity, and med|ling with other People's Bu&s;ine&s;s, as our Text in&s;tructs us; &s;uch as do their own Bu&s;ine&s;s are di&s;pos'd to be quiet, but &s;uch as work not at all are bu&s;y-Bodies, 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> iii 11. The Apo&s;tle farther de&s;cribes in &s;trong and lively Colours, the Character and Cour&s;e of &s;uch unhappy People, in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy</HI> the 5th Chap. and 13th Ver&s;e, <HI>Thus, and with all, they learn to be idle, wandring about from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e; and not only idle, but tatlers al&s;o, and bu&s;ie Bodies, &s;peaking Things which they ought not.</HI></P>
<P>Such as neglect their own Affairs, are apt to intrude into other Peoples to their Shame. Idlers are apt to be full of imper|tinent, and &s;ometimes invideous Chatt. The&s;e Tale bearers and Tattlers are like Powder-Monkey's in an Army, incendia|ries to Mi&s;chief; who try, by their Tongues, which are emphatically Worlds of Iniquity, to &s;et Neighbourhoods and Societies in a Flame. They are the Pe&s;ts of Society, and Bane of Conver&s;ation. The Word <HI>Tale-bear|er,</HI> mention'd <HI>Levi.</HI> xix. 16. <Q>&s;ignifies a

<P>But to return. Diligence is Nece&s;&s;ary in every Condition of Life, it is needful to pre&s;erve Wealth and Honour, and improve them to a valuable De&s;ign. It is needful to remove Poverty and Di&s;grace, and prevent our de&s;ponding under their Pre&s;ures.</P>
<P>Without this we cannot di&s;charge with Honour any Tru&s;t in Life from the Scep|ter to the Spade.</P>
<P>Diligence manife&s;ts a noble Temper of Mind that di&s;dains to be &s;upported at the Expence of anothers Care and Labour, without a Compen&s;ation. Such who are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of this Vertue, will not like Rats, or other noxious Animals, &s;teal their Sup|port from the publick Granary, without do|ing &s;omething worthy of it.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="005498_0024_1018404472E1F488">Dilligence is in it&s;elf plea&s;ant and agree|able: This Tempers our Troubles, and a&s;|&s;wages the Pains that attends our Labours, by bringing the Mind from an uncomforta|ble Su&s;pen&s;e, and fixing of it upon lawful Objects, as well as by opening the agree|able Pro&s;pect of a future Good.</P>
<P>This frees us from the Trouble of I|dlene&s;s, which is a Burthen to it &s;elf, and cau&s;es unea&s;ie Reflections upon our lo&s;s of Time, and abu&s;e of Talents!</P>
<P>Diligence gives a greatful Gu&s;t to the Enjoyments which have been thereby pro|cur'd more e&s;pecially: And hence <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, That <HI>the Sub&s;tance of a diligent Man is precious; and that his Sleep is &s;weet.</HI> And certainly as the Fruits of Diligence ta&s;te &s;weete&s;t, &s;o they are like to la&s;t longe&s;t, becau&s;e of the Ble&s;&s;ing of God upon them.</P>
<P>Diligence produces Ea&s;e and prevents Trouble. It was a Noble &s;aying of a <HI>Pa|gan</HI> Philo&s;opher, <Q>Whether <HI>(&s;aid he)</HI> La|bour be to be cho&s;en Labour, or whether it be to be e&s;chewed, labour that thou maye&s;t not labour; for by not labouring Labour is not e&s;caped, but is rather pur&s;ued.</Q> Sloth loo&s;es the Ea&s;e it de&s;ires, and pro|cures

the Di&s;quiet it dreads, by expo&s;ing tho&s;e that are guilty of it to a Train of impertinent and perplexing Thoughts, as well as to Want and Ignominy, which can|not be endur'd without Di&s;quiet: But on the contrary, Diligence tends to Honour and Plenty, and &s;erves to &s;upport every Station of Life with Reputation; whereas Sloth intimidates the Mind with cau&s;ele&s;s Fears. <HI>The Way of the &s;lothful,</HI> &s;ays Solo|mon, <HI>is a Hedge of Thornes, and he is apt to &s;ay there is a Lyon before him.</HI></P>
<P>To what, my Brethren, but Diligence, can we a&s;cribe all the Works of Art, all the curious Structures and &s;tately Orna|ments which we behold the World beauti|fy'd with? And i&s;n't it this that has adorn'd the human Mind with the nobler Beau|ties of Science? I may add, that Diligence is commended to our Imitation by all Sorts of Examples. Univer&s;al Nature is a Gla&s;s in which we may behold the Nece&s;&s;ity and Excellency of this Duty; the inanimate Parts of the Creation, are in a Cour&s;e of their con&s;tant Labour to an&s;wer the De&s;ign of their Being; the Luminaries of Heaven cea&s;e not to perform their di&s;tin'd Travels, and

to &s;end down their wanted Influence to a&s;&s;i&s;t the pregnant Earth in its Productions; which the late Mathematicions a&s;&s;ure us has its con&s;tant Motion, both Diurnal and Annual The Plants grow; the Winds blu&s;ter variably round the Globe; the Sea does not forget its wonted Ebs and Flows, and often roars and &s;wells Mountains high; the Rivers run re&s;tle&s;ly their retrograde meandrine Cour&s;es until they meet the Oci|on from whence they derive their Original, and &s;o return the Waters they borrow by a con&s;tant Circulation: By the&s;e liquid Veins the Body of the Earth is refre&s;h'd and fitted for Increa&s;e. And do not the animate Creation labour likewi&s;e? A noble Example of which we have in the <HI>Ant,</HI> to which the Sluggard is advis'd by God him|&s;elf, <HI>to repair for In&s;truction,</HI> Pro. vi. 6.</P>
<P>We have likewi&s;e many Examples of Diligence in the rational Creation, the <HI>Pa|triarks, Prophets,</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were in la|bours and watchings often; yea Chri&s;t him|&s;elf the Prince of Prophets labour'd while the Day la&s;ted.&mdash;</P>
<P>But if we pa&s;s this lower Globe, and fix our Thoughts on the angelick Throng,
<PB N="28" REF="005498_0027_10184051A5749B98">
are not the&s;e winged Inhabitants of Hea|ven, who wait on the Throne of God, in a Cour&s;e of Continual Action, celebrating the divine Prai&s;e, and executing the divine Plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>Yea, my Brethren, the great the glorious God him&s;elf, who is the Fountain of Being, of Excellency and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, is, as Divines ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, a &s;imple Act.</P>
<P>And &s;hall we be only idle while all Things are bu&s;y round about us, above us, and be|neath us; God forbid.</P>
<P>Having &s;poken of the Duties expre&s;ly re|commended in our Text. I proceed to di&s;|cour&s;e upon the Sin therein tacitly oppos'd; which is that of intermedling in other Mens Bu&s;ine&s;s, while we are exhorted <HI>to be quiet and do our own Bu&s;ine&s;s;</HI> it is imply'd, that it is &s;inful and tending to di&s;quiet, needle&s;ly to medle with other Peoples Bu&s;ine&s;s. In di&s;cour&s;ing upon this point, I &s;hall endea|vour to &s;hew, 1&s;t. Negatively, what is not &s;inful intermedling. 2d. Po&s;itively, &s;hew what it is. And 3d. Speak of the Evil thereof. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Negatively. It is not &s;inful inter|medling when we hear God Name Bla&s;|phemed,

his Truths oppos'd and People re|proach'd, to &s;tand up in Vindication of them, if we have a Capacity, &s;o that the Truth is not like to &s;uffer thro' our weak de|fence, at lea&s;t we &s;hould &s;hew our Di&s;like by our Behaviour or withdrawing from the Company: Every Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t is bound to &s;hew his Di&s;&s;atisfaction, in the Ca&s;e afore&s;aid, by his Allegiance to God.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;inful intermedling, to interpo&s;e when the publick &s;afety is endangered, or the Character, Life or E&s;tate of any parti|cular Per&s;on is unju&s;tly a&s;&s;aulted; nay it is &s;o far from this, that Ju&s;tice and Charity re|quires our Defence. When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aw one of his Bretheren &s;uffer wrong, he defended him and &s;mote the oppre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Farther, for Superiors, viz.

<P>Neither can it be rea&s;onably reckon'd &s;in|ful intermedling, for us to defend our own

Names, E&s;tates and Lives again&s;t unju&s;t Vi|olence, for this the Law of Nature teaches, and if we do not &s;o, we are acce&s;&s;ary to our own Injury and Death.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e far from criminal intermed|ling, to embrace opportunities that pre&s;ent, to do Service to the Souls of our fellow Creatures, e&s;pecially when there is any pro|bability of our Pains being Succe&s;sful. But,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Po&s;itively.</HI> It is &s;inful intermedling,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t.

<P N="2">2dly. It is &s;inful intermedling when in or|dinary Ca&s;es (without clamant Cau&s;e) we obtrude our Advice upon others, e&s;pecially our Superiors, not being ask'd; for this is in|terpretatively a claiming &s;uperiority over

<P N="3">3dly. It is likewi&s;e &s;inful intermedling, when Per&s;ons of a private Character autho|ritively reprove their Superiors, and ra&s;hly cen&s;ure others acting in a Province, which they have no Bu&s;ine&s;s with, and do not under|&s;tand. We &s;hould not rebuke an Elder, but intreat him as a Father; and indeed when we do reprove our inferiors we &s;hould be careful re&s;pecting the Manner of it, other|wi&s;e it will &s;erve only to inflame the Di&s;|ea&s;e in&s;tead of curing it. The Fact for which we reprove, &s;hould be true and bad, otherwi&s;e we are guilty of Slander and Tyranny: Such as condemn their Brethren for that which is no Crime, they &s;peak evil of the Law, and interpretatively judge it to be an in&s;ufficient Rule of human Actions. (<HI>James</HI> iv. 11.) Reproof &s;hould not be mini&s;tred for every infirmity that flows from

It is al&s;o needful that they be well tim'd and dipp'd in Sugar; neither &s;hould they be offered in publick Company, (at lea&s;t at fir&s;t) or to People in a Pa&s;&s;ion. Our Lord's reproof to the Church at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> is in|troduc'd with a Commendation; (<HI>Rev.</HI> 2.) Neither &s;hould we reprove Scorners, lea&s;t we get to our&s;elves a Blot; or affect the re|proves Place, for that is a Sign of ill Nature and Arrogance.</P>
<P>It is lamentable to think, that many &s;eem to incline to know, the Duty of Per&s;ons of other Stations, rather than their own! It is an awful Sign of Pride and ill Nature, to meddle with Things that are too high for us, and to condemn the&s;e Things in others which we under&s;tand not, and which do not concern us, or belong to our judicial Notice. <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 4. <HI>Who art thou that judge&s;t ano|ther Man's Servant, to his own Ma&s;ter he &s;tandeth or falleth?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. Another In&s;tance of &s;inful inter|medling is when we interpo&s;e in conte&s;ts without a Call, or any probability of doing

Good thereby. If we do interpo&s;e in De|bates, as mediators of Peace, we &s;hould be|ware of making our&s;elves Parties in the Fray, and of puting Fuel to the Flame, by di&s;clo&s;ing the Secrets of one to the other, or by hard Con&s;tructions on the Words of either Party: On the Contrary we &s;hould endeavour to a&s;wage their Pa&s;&s;ions by mild Interpretations, pungent Arguments, and affectionate Entreaties; in the mean Time waving the Expre&s;&s;ion of our Judgment, who is mo&s;t in the fault, otherwi&s;e our At|tempts are like to fail of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. It is likewi&s;e faulty intermedling when we are inqui&s;itive into Mens de&s;igns, and labour to di&s;cover their Secrets; if they di&s;cover them, it is with Regret, and if not they are like to offend us without a Cau&s;e; and indeed to cen&s;ure Men as guilty of a bad De&s;ign, when their Actions are good, is a Breach of the Law of Charity, and an unju&s;t Encroachment upon the Province of the Almighty, who&s;e Prerogative it is alone to &s;earch the Hearts and try the Reigns of the Children of Men. Again,</P>
<P N="6">6thly. We go out of our proper Sphere when in Matters of an indifferent Nature,
<PB N="35" REF="005498_0033_101840662D4C15A8">
we infringe upon the Liberty of others, and cro&s;s their Humour by trying to impo&s;e our Opinions upon them. We may mo|de&s;tly propo&s;e the Rea&s;ons of our Judgment to our equals in di&s;cour&s;e with them, but to pre&s;s farther is uncivil, and like to have no good Effect.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. Idle tatlers are e&s;pecially guilty of this Evil of Criminal intermedling, who, at their Go&s;&s;opings and Teatables, judge Peoples States, and a&s;per&s;e their Characters: The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of &s;ome Women in his Time who learned <HI>to be idle wandring about from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e; and not only idle, but tatlers al&s;o, and bu&s;ie Bodies, &s;peaking things which they ought not,</HI> 1 Tim. v. 13. It is much to be lamented that that Evil has not expir'd with the Apo&s;tolick Age, but is Flagrant at this Time and in this Place! And tho' Females are peculiarly Guilty of it, po&s;&s;ibly in a greater Degree, becau&s;e of the Talkativene&s;s natural to the Sex, and their quicker Pa&s;&s;ions; yet the Males are far from being clear of it. Do not &s;ome ra&s;hly cen&s;ure the Management of others, in a Sphere which does not belong to them, and which indeed they do not under&s;tand?

Hereby medling with Things too high for them, contrary to the P&s;almi&s;ts Practice, P&s;. cxxxi. 1. <HI>Lord my Heart is not haughty, nor mine Eyes lofty; neither do I exerci&s;e my &s;elf in great Matters, or in Things two high for me.</HI> And are not &s;ome guilty of judging Ca&s;es before they hear them fully?

<P>But I proceed to &s;peak of the Evil of in|termedling in others Affairs. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It is unmannerly to intermedle without an Invitation, or urgent Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P N="2">2d. It is unju&s;t, it is a robing another of his Liberty of acting for him&s;elf with Free|dom, and what we woudn't have another do by us.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It is needle&s;s, People generally know their own (&s;ecular) Affairs be&s;t, hav|ing a View of all their Circum&s;tances, and bending their Thoughts much that Way.</P>

Our &s;evere cen&s;uring and cruel judging is no Evidence of the Keenne&s;s of our Under&s;tandings, but rather of the Gro&s;sne&s;s of our Ignorance of God's Word and our own Hearts. Such doings are a &s;ign of little or no Grace; for Hypocrits are like Strumpets, who love to be much abroad: But &s;incere Souls are like hone&s;t Women, who keep at home and mind their own Bu&s;ine&s;s. Our Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion gives no lawle&s;s Loo&s;e to our Tongues, but lays us under greater Obliga|tions to re&s;train them, and he who does not &s;o, his Religion is Vain. (<HI>Jam.</HI> i. 26.)</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="005498_0036_10184074DD897A48">O how is God's honourable Name wound|ed, and his precious Truths &s;tabb'd as it were by the Conte&s;ts, Wranglings, and Re|vilings of Profe&s;&s;ors! Alas! where are Mercy, Forbearance, and brotherly Love fled away? O! has love taken its final Flight to Heaven, and utterly left the Earth? Do we profe&s;s my Brethren, that God has forgiven us Ten Thou&s;and Talents, and yet take our poor Brother by the Throat for a few Pence? O awful incon&s;i&s;tent Proceed|ing! Shoudn't we be merciful as our hea|venly Father is merciful. Let us Sirs either re&s;train our Tongues, and reform our Lives, or lay down our Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion alto|gether, that &s;o the noble Intere&s;ts of Piety, may not bleed thro' our incon&s;i&s;|tent Conduct. I &s;hall conclude this Di&s;|cour&s;e in the Words of the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> 3d. Chap. from the 13th to the 18th Ver&s;e. <HI>Who is a Wi&s;e Man, and endu'd with Knowledge among&s;t you? Let him &s;hew out of a good Conver&s;ation his Works with Meek|ne&s;s of Wi&s;dom. But if ye have bitter En|vying and Strife in your Hearts, glory not, and lie not again&s;t the Truth. This VVi&s;dom de&s;endeth not from above, but is earthly, &s;en&s;u|al,

develi&s;h. For where Envying and Strife is, there is Confu&s;ion, and every evil VVork. But the Wi&s;dom that is from above is fir&s;t Pure, then peaceable, gentle and ea&s;ie to be entreat|ed, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality and without Hypocri&s;y. And the the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;own in Peace of them that make Peace.</HI></P>
