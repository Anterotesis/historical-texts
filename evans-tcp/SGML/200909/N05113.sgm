<P>Whom God hath &s;et forth to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteou&s;ne&s;s for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins that are pa&s;t, through the forbearance of God:</P>
<P>To declare, I &s;ay, of this Time his Righteou&s;ne&s;s: That he might be ju&s;t and the ju&s;tifier of him which believeth in Je&s;us.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE un&s;earchable <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and unparrallel'd <HI>Love</HI> of God, are not only con&s;picuous in the Method of our Redemption by the Lord JESUS CHRIST, but the Glory of His Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s is herein likewi&s;e very apparent, as the Ver&s;es I have read inform us; in which we have the&s;e three Things, <HI>viz.</HI> Two important Benefits mentioned, <HI>Propitia|tion</HI> for, and <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion&punc;</HI> Sin 2. The <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> hereof a&s;&s;igned both meritorious and in&s;trumental, the <HI>Blood</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>Faith.</HI> 3. The <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of God herein declared, <HI>viz.</HI> The manife&s;tation of his <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Benefit mentioned in our Text, is <HI>Propitiation</HI> or <HI>Attone|ment, whom God hath &s;et forth to be a Propitiation.</HI> It is <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> that the Apo&s;tle here Speaks of, as appears from the preceeding Ver&s;e, him the Father hath purpos'd and engaged in his Councils and Covenant from Eternity to be a PROPITIATION, and hath actually exhibited him as &s;uch in Time, not only by the Shadows of the Law and Prophe&s;ies of the Prophets, but al&s;o by the open preach|ing of the Go&s;pel after his Advent. To be a Propitiation, <HI>ila&s;te|rion,</HI> either from <HI>ila&s;comai,</HI> to expiate Sin or &s;hew Mercy; or from <HI>ila&s;co placo,</HI> to a&s;&s;wage, quiet, pacify, atone, reconcile, There is in the Words a <HI>Metalep&s;is</HI> of the Effect for the Efficient; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is call'd a <HI>Propitiation</HI> becau&s;e he purcha&s;ed it, in&s;tead of <HI>propitiator,</HI> reconciler, pacifyer, &amp;c. The Word <HI>ila&s;terion,</HI> is the Title of the Mercy Seat; this is a&s;crib'd to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e in many Things he re&s;embles it; it was indeed an eminent Type of him: The Mercy Seat cover'd the Tables of the Law which were broke by us, to &s;ignify that by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> pardon is procur'd for us;
<PB N="4" REF="006426_0003_1028E4816A1285E8">
by the &s;prinkling of the Blood of the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> upon it, God was rendered propitious or favourable, and exhibited him&s;elf there upon a Throne of Grace, &s;o it is in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone that God is re|conciled to Sinners, and thro' him we have acce&s;s to the Father: He interpo&s;es between divine <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and our <HI>Guilt,</HI> and purcha&s;es the Kindne&s;s of God for us. God was peculiarly pre&s;ent in a Cloud on the Mercy Seat, and gave gracious An&s;wers thence to his People from between the Cherubims, (<HI>Levit.</HI> xvi. 2. <HI>Num.</HI> vii. 83.) Thus it is only in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> that we can expect God's &s;pecial Pre|&s;ence and a merciful An&s;wer to our Reque&s;ts.</P>
<P>The 2d <HI>Benefit</HI> mentioned in our Text, which is indeed but a con&s;equent of the former, is the <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Sins,</HI> i. e. The cancelling of their Guilt, or our Obligation thro' them to Puni&s;h|ment. Now this is obtained by the <HI>Propitiation</HI> or Atonement of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> This Remi&s;&s;ion the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, extends to <HI>Sins that are pa&s;t,</HI> i. e. Not only to Sins committed after <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> coming, but to Sins committed before it, even from the Foundation of the World: He only mentions the Sins that are pa&s;t, becau&s;e that &s;eem'd incredible that the Effect of Remi&s;&s;ion &s;hould exi&s;t before its Cau&s;e, and likewi&s;e that he might repre&s;ent the great Value and Efficacy of the <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> which not only extended forwards to the Time to come after it, which is ea&s;y to conceive, but al&s;o to the Time pa&s;t before it. It was a difficult and momentuous Que&s;tion, What became of the Fathers who dyed before <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s coming? Now the Apo&s;tle tells us, that they were forgiven, and God's forbearance exerci&s;ed towards them, <HI>the Times of Ignorance God winked at.</HI> We mu&s;t con&s;ider the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> not as a natural but a moral Cau&s;e; it's not &s;trictly or properly as a <HI>Medicine</HI> that heals, but as a <HI>Ran&s;om</HI> that frees a Captive. Natural Cau&s;es operate nothing before their actual Exi&s;tence, but Moral Cau&s;es do. Its &s;ufficient that they &s;hall be, and that the Per&s;on with whom they are effectual, accept the Promi&s;e. A Captive is relea&s;ed upon a&s;&s;urance given that he will &s;end his Ran&s;om, tho' it is not actually paid: Thus the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was available to purcha&s;e pardon for Believers before his coming; for he interpo&s;ed as their <HI>Surety,</HI> and God, to whom all Things are pre&s;ent, knew and &s;aw the accompli&s;hment of it in the Time promi&s;ed; and hence he is called <HI>the Lamb &s;lain from the Foundation of the World,</HI> not only in re&s;pect of God's Purpo&s;e concerning the certainty of his Death, but likewi&s;e in re|gard of the Efficacy of it. The Salvation we derive from him was ever in him. It is true, under the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> they had not &s;o clear Knowledge of him, yet notwith&s;tanding they enjoyed the Benefit of his Sufferings: For the <HI>Medium</HI> by which his Benefits are conveyed, is not an exact Knowledge of what he did and &s;uf|fered, but &s;incere Faith in the Promi&s;e of God. Now the divine Revelation being the Rule and Mea&s;ure of our Faith, &s;uch a De|gree was &s;ufficient to Salvation, as an&s;wered the general Di&s;covery of Grace: Believers then depended upon God's Goodne&s;s to par|don
<PB N="5" REF="006426_0004_1028E484B6A87E20">
them in a way honourable to his Ju&s;tice: By their Ceremonies and Sacrifices they were taught the reality and greatne&s;s of their Di&s;ea&s;e and Danger, and the nece&s;&s;ity and &s;ufficiency of a Remedy without them&s;elves, even in the <HI>Me&s;iah:</HI> And from hence, together with the Prophe&s;ies of the Prophets re&s;pecting him, they were in|duced to believe that he would certainly come in due Time and bring Salvation with him: Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> rejoiced to &s;ee <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Day, and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> valued the Afflictions of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> more than the Trea|&s;ures of <HI>Egypt.</HI> From what has been &s;aid it appears, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian Church</HI> is one e&s;&s;entially; they differ but as the Morning and Evening Star, which is the &s;ame, but is diver&s;ly called from its Appearance before the Sun ri&s;ing and after its &s;etting. Our Faith re&s;pects a Saviour that has already come, theirs re&s;pect him as yet to come.</P>
<P>NOW the <HI>meritorious Cau&s;e</HI> of the Benefits of <HI>Propitiation</HI> and Remi&s;&s;ion, is the <HI>Blood</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t, i. e.</HI> by a Synedoche the whole <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which began in the obedience of his Humilia|tion, and was con&s;umated in his Death</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>in&s;trumental Cau&s;e</HI> of the Application of the afore&s;aid Benefits to us, and our Inve&s;titure in them is <HI>Faith,</HI> &s;uch a cordial Complacence in, and entire Dependance on the Method of Salvation by the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as habitually attracts the Mind and Life, to the Love of <HI>Truth,</HI> and Practice of <HI>Good,</HI> both moral and evan|gelical, <HI>whom GOD hath &s;et forth to be a Propitiation thro' Faith in his Blood;</HI> and indeed the Wi&s;dom of the divine Con|&s;titution is herein apparent, that an actual Intere&s;t in the Benefits of CHRIST'S Death, is communicated in a way intirely con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Purity</HI> of GOD'S <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> of his <HI>Government.</HI> Sinners mu&s;t fir&s;t humble them&s;elves before GOD for their Offen|ces, and accept the <HI>Mediator</HI> before they are forgiven. But the</P>
<P N="3">3d. PARTICULAR in our <HI>Text,</HI> is the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of <HI>GOD</HI> in our <HI>Redemption</HI> by JESUS CHRIST, and that is the <HI>Manife&s;tation</HI> of his <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and Righteou&s;ne&s;s: <HI>Whom God hath &s;et forth to be a Propi|tiation thro' Faith in his Blood to declare his Righteou&s;ne&s;s. To declare I &s;ay at this Time his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that he might be ju&s;t; and the Ju&s;tifier of him that believes in JESUS.</HI> This Point is repeated with earne&s;tne&s;s by the Apo&s;tle, not only to &s;ignify its great Importance, and inexpre&s;&s;ible Mo|ment, but likewi&s;e to make the deeper Impre&s;&s;ion by it upon our <HI>Minds.</HI> The <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of GOD is that Perfection of his <HI>Na|ture,</HI> whereby he is inclined to render every one his <HI>Due:</HI> That at|tribute whereby he is di&s;po&s;ed to hate Sin, and puni&s;h Sinners ac|cording to their Demerit; now of this the ble&s;&s;ed GOD has given a glorious but awful Demon&s;tration, in the Sufferings of CHRIST; by condemning and puni&s;hing Sin, in the Per&s;on of his only be|gotten and dearly beloved Son; hereby the Almighty &s;hews before the whole World, the Inflexiblene&s;s and Severity of his <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> and that he will not &s;uffer Sin to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>FROM the Words of our Text thus explain'd, I would ob&s;erve
<PB N="6" REF="006426_0005_1028E4882AD45EE8">
the following Propo&s;ition, <HI>viz. That the Ju&s;tice of GOD is glo|riou&s;ly manife&s;t, or declared in the Redemption of Man, by the Death of JESUS CHRIST:</HI> Altho' GOD &s;pared guilty Man for the Ho|nour of his <HI>Mercy,</HI> yet he &s;pared not his own <HI>Son,</HI> when he be came the Sinner's <HI>Surety,</HI> for the Honour of his <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>IN &s;peaking upon this Propo&s;ition I would,</P>
<P N="1">I. OPEN <HI>the</HI> Nature <HI>of GOD's</HI> Ju&s;tice. And,</P>
<P N="2">II. SHEW <HI>how it is gloriou&s;ly manife&s;t in the</HI> Redemption <HI>of Man by the</HI> Death <HI>of</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and then proceed to the <HI>Im|provement.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of GOD, is that eternal <HI>Rectitude</HI> of the <HI>divine Nature,</HI> whereby he orders and di&s;po&s;es all Things, according to the <HI>Rules</HI> that his infinite Wi&s;dom has pre&s;cribed; and governs all Mankind with the utmo&s;t Exactne&s;s and Impartiality in Relation to the Di&s;tribution of <HI>Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments;</HI> to illu&s;trate this we &s;hould ob&s;erve, that there is an intrin&s;ick RECTITUDE and ODDI|QUITY in Things, and that the Rea&s;ons and Relations of moral Good and Evil, do not depend upon any uncertain and arbitrary Principle; but are fixed and immutable, indi&s;pen&s;able, and eter|nal&punc; pur&s;uant to this, that <HI>Truth, Goodne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> are e&s;&s;en|tial and nece&s;&s;ary Properties, in the divine Nature; antecedent to any Con&s;ideration of the divine Will; and what he can no more alter or un&s;ettle, than he can deny him&s;elf or cea&s;e to be; that as he is the Maker and Governor of the World, he has an undoubt|ed Authority to make <HI>Laws,</HI> and enforce them with proper <HI>Sanc|tions;</HI> that when Laws are thus enacted, he &s;etts Bounds in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to his own Authority; for Ju&s;tice requires that he &s;hould not pre&s;cribe what is above Man's Strength, or if he does, that he &s;hould give &s;upernatural Power to obey it; that upon Obedience he cannot without Prejudice to his Ju&s;tice, deny the promis'd Re|ward, or, upon Di&s;obedience, finally forbear to inflict the threatned Puni&s;hment: And from hence it follows, that GOD is nece&s;&s;arily obliged, both by his Nature and Covenant, to act with the &s;tricte&s;t Ju&s;tice and Impartiality, in all his Proceedings with Man: But I proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">II. Propos'd, Which was to &s;hew how divine Ju&s;tice is gloriou&s;ly manife&s;t, in the Redemption of Man, by the Death of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Now the Particular in which, or Manner how divine <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> is glorify'd by the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is the Satisfaction that has been made thereto by it. In order to open this important and FUN|DAMENTAL POINT, of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION, and give it its ju&s;t Weight, let me endeavour to repre&s;ent,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE indi&s;pen&s;able <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> there was of a <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to Ju&s;tice, in order to our <HI>Redemption</HI> and <HI>Salvation.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">2. EVINCE the <HI>Reality</HI> and <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of that which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has made thereto by his <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Satisfaction to <HI>divine Ju&s;tice</HI> in order to our Redemption and Salvation, appears from the Con&s;ideration of the Nature of GOD, and his Relation to intelligent Creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="006426_0006_1028E48B1F707640"><HI>JUSTICE</HI> being a natural and nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Perfection</HI> of the di|vine <HI>Nature,</HI> hath con&s;equently an invariable Re&s;pect to the mo|ral Qualities of intelligent <HI>Beings,</HI> as divine Goodne&s;s in &s;ome Degree naturally and nece&s;&s;arily diffu&s;es it&s;elf upon Agents, per|fectly pure and innocent, &s;o likewi&s;e Ju&s;tice terminates upon the Guilty and Nocent by Puni&s;hments equal to their Crimes; except a Satisfaction intervene. If it be impo&s;&s;ible con&s;idering the Per|fection of the Diety that Holine&s;s &s;hould be unrewarded, then &s;urely it mu&s;t be more impo&s;&s;ible that Sin &s;hould be unpuni&s;hed; &s;eeing the Exerci&s;e of Ju&s;tice is more nece&s;&s;ary than that of Good|ne&s;s; for the Rewards which Goodne&s;s di&s;pen&s;es are pure Favour, ina&s;much as the Creature has received it's Being, and all its Bene|fits from GOD, all the Services it can perform, are due to him on account hereof, and if &s;o, by the Payment of a ju&s;t Debt, they cannot merit fre&s;h Benefits; but the Puni&s;hments which Ju&s;|tice inflicts are due and demerited, for violating the Rights of Heaven, and all the Obligations they are laid under to GOD; &s;eeing <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> in it's Nature is a Perfection, it mu&s;t of Con&s;e|quence be in GOD, who is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all kinds of Excellency, and that in the highe&s;t Degree of Eminence, or infinitely, and if &s;o it is inflexible and eternal.</P>
<P>SIN is directly contrary to the divine <HI>Purity,</HI> and therefore he mu&s;t as nece&s;&s;arily hate it, as he loves him&s;elf; this is evident from the Law of Contraries, as well as from the P&s;almi&s;t's Ob&s;er|vation, <HI>The righteous Lord loveth Righteoune&s;s, but the Wicked his Soul hateth.</HI> Now <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> is but a natural Effect, and pro|per Manife&s;tation of this <HI>Hatred;</HI> and therefore it is not an arbi|trary Con&s;tituion; it is true, the Time and Manner of it's In|fliction is founded in divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> but the <HI>Matter</HI> or <HI>Sub|&s;tance</HI> of it is bottom'd on the e&s;&s;ential <HI>Purity</HI> and Rectitude of the divine <HI>Nature</HI> to which Sin is repugnant.</P>
<P>BUT if together with what has been offered, re&s;pecting the di|vine Nature; we con&s;ider the Relation <HI>Jehovah</HI> bears to the moral World, it adds much Light and Force to this Argument.</P>
<P>ALMIGHTY GOD in the Character of a <HI>Governor,</HI> is obliged to protect the Laws of his Government from Reproach and In|&s;ult.</P>
<P>AS it was proper and nece&s;&s;ary, that the rea&s;onable Creature &s;hould have a <HI>Law</HI> to direct it, in that <HI>Homage</HI> and Service, which it had a Capacity to perform to its Creator and Sovereign.</P>
<P>SO it is highly rea&s;onable that the afore&s;aid <HI>Law</HI> &s;hould be con|firm'd by &s;uch important Sanctions, as were nece&s;&s;ary to procure the Creature's Obedience.</P>
<P><HI>SIN</HI> being the greate&s;t moral <HI>Evil,</HI> becau&s;e oppo&s;ite to the greate&s;t moral <HI>Good</HI> the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, it is but &s;uitable that it &s;hould be puni&s;hed with the greate&s;t penal Evil, <HI>viz.</HI> Death.</P>
<P>NOW the <HI>Law</HI> being broken, was it not ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, that the Penalty threatned &s;hould be inflicted, either upon the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or him&s;elf, according to the immediate Intent of the
<PB N="8" REF="006426_0007_1028E48DB6595480">
<HI>Law,</HI> or upon &s;uch a <HI>Surety</HI> in his room, as was able to make Satisfaction equivalent to the Offence; that &s;o the <HI>Maje&s;ty, Pu|rity,</HI> and <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of GOD might be rendered con&s;picuous, as well as the Value he puts upon Obedience to his <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Penalty threatened be not inflicted, upon a proper Oc|ca&s;ion, does it not reflect either upon his WISDOM, as if he had not with good Rea&s;on concerted the SANCTION, or upon his POWER, as if he was not able to inflict it, or upon his PURITY, as tho' he conniv'd with Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; or upon his TRUTH, in|a&s;much as his Word is not perform'd. And would not Sinners be hereby induced to contemn the Law and the Lawgiver, and en|courag'd in their Impieties? All which Con&s;iderations plainly prove the Nece&s;&s;ity of Satisfaction for the Breach of GOD'S Laws; without this, GOD'S Hatred again&s;t Sin would not be declared, nor the <HI>Honour</HI> of his <HI>Laws</HI> pre&s;erved, nor a &s;uitable <HI>Fear</HI> of offending him awak'd, every of which are nece&s;&s;ary and excellent: It is true, temporal Magi&s;trates are &s;ometimes obliged to di&s;pen&s;e with the Law, and &s;pare an Offender, either thro' inabillity to puni&s;h him, or becau&s;e his Life may be of more Service to the State; and &s;till there is a &s;uperior Tribunal, to which the Ca&s;e either is, or ought to be referred; but GOD'S Government is very different, no Criminal can either e&s;cape his Notice, bya&s;s his Ju&s;tice, or controul his Power; here is no Exigency of Govern|ment that requires Impunity, no &s;uperior <HI>Tribunal:</HI> Moreover the <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Laws</HI> is more &s;acred than that of Civil States and Kingdoms. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. I am to evince the <HI>Reality</HI> and <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of that <HI>Satisfac|tion</HI> which CHRIST paid to divine <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> by his Death. And to this End, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the PREQUISITES in order to it; and the Account the &s;acred Scriptures give of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Death,</HI> together with the CONSEQUENTS thereof.</P>
<P>NOW in order to Satisfaction, the&s;e Things were previou&s;ly ne|ce&s;&s;ary, <HI>viz.</HI> The per&s;onal <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Mediator;</HI> his being <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s'd</HI> of the divine and human <HI>Natures;</HI> his <HI>Appointment</HI> to undertake this Province, and his <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> thereto.</P>
<P>HE that &s;atisfies for another's Sin mu&s;t be without Sin him&s;elf, for guilty Blood is impure and con&s;equently &s;tains by its Effu&s;ion rather than clean&s;es: Now the Lord JESUS was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, &s;eparate from Sinners, he appeared to take away Sin and in him was no Sin: To prevent his Infection with original Sin propogated by natural Generation, he was conceived in a miracu|lous Manner, by the Power of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> according to the Angel's Declaration, <HI>The Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall come upon thee, and the Power of the highe&s;t &s;hall over&s;hadow thee, therefore al&s;o that holy Thing that &s;hall be born of thee &s;hall be called the Son of GOD.</HI> And as he was perfectly free from original, &s;o likewi&s;e from actual Sin; Satan, when he came found nothing in him, to fa&s;ten his Temptation upon; and therefore was baffled in all his Stratagems; tho' he came in the likene&s;s of &s;inful Fle&s;h, yet he had no Sin:
<PB N="9" REF="006426_0008_1028E493F49AE758">
ju&s;t as the brazen Serpent had the Figure, but not the Venom of the fiery Serpent: Our Lord fulfilled all Righteou&s;nes, and ever did what plea&s;ed his Father.</P>
<P>NAY our Lord was not only free from Sin, but it was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould be tainted with it, becau&s;e of the intimate Union of his human Nature with the divine; the divine Nature being Holine&s;s it&s;elf, and Almighty Power, mu&s;t needs by its Pre&s;ence and Union in&s;allibly prevent Sin in the Redeemer.</P>
<P>BUT it was not only nece&s;&s;ary that the MEDIATOR &s;hould be per&s;onally holy, in order to make Satisfaction, but likewi&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of the divine and human Natures: He mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume the Nature of Man, that he might be ally'd to him, and capable of &s;uffering in his &s;tead, for the Deity cannot &s;uffer. Under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Oeconomy, the Right of Redemption belong'd to him that was next in Blood; hence our Lord took upon him the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> that he might have a Right of Propinquity or near Alliance as Man, to redeem us, and be capable to make Satisfaction for us in the &s;ame Nature that &s;inn'd.</P>
<P>NOR was it le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary that the MEDIATOR &s;hould be GOD, that &s;o the human Nature might be &s;upported under its Sufferings, and they made of infinite Value, and &s;o equivalent to the de|merit of Sin. JUSTICE required an exact Proportion between the Guilt of Sin, and the Satisfaction made for it, which could not be, if the <HI>Mediator</HI> had not been <HI>GOD.</HI> The Guilt of Sin is doubtle&s;s infinite, becau&s;e committed again&s;t an infinite GOD, but the Suf|ferings of any finite Nature can be but finite in Mea&s;ure and Va|lue; and there was an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of a Union of the di|vine and human Natures, in the Per&s;on of the <HI>Mediator,</HI> to com|municate an infinite <HI>Dignity</HI> to his Sufferings: By Rea&s;on of this Union there is a Communication of the &s;pecial Properties of both <HI>Natures</HI> to the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which being properly the Foun|tain of his Actions, mu&s;t needs communicate an infinite Merit and Dignity to them all, and hence it is &s;aid, that <HI>the Lord of Glory was crucified;</HI> and that we are <HI>purcha&s;ed by the Blood of GOD,</HI> the human Nature being united to the divine, the Actions pro|ceeding from it, are not meerly human, but rais'd above their natural Worth, and therefore meritorious and infinitely excellent: One Hour of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Life glorified GOD, more than Millions of Ages &s;pent in his Service by Men and Angels, becau&s;e this being done by Creatures, can be but finite and limited; but the other being the Obedience of one who is GOD, is of infinite Excellen|cy, and worthy of GOD: <HI>He that</HI> comes from <HI>above, is above all;</HI> the &s;ame may &s;aid of his Sufferings.</P>
<P>ANOTHER <HI>Pre-requi&s;ite</HI> to Satisfaction, is the <HI>Mediators Appoint|ment</HI> to undertake this Province; without this his Mediation would have been in vain, being de&s;titute of &s;ufficient Authority. Now the Scriptures plainly and po&s;itively declare our Lord's Appointment to the mediatorial Work, in the&s;e Words <HI>for him hath GOD the Father &s;ealed,</HI> GOD anointed <HI>Je&s;us</HI> of <HI>Nazareth with the Ho|ly
<PB N="10" REF="006426_0009_1028E496D122A090">
Gho&s;t, and with Power, the Lord hath &s;worn and will not repent, thou art a Prie&s;t forever after the Order of</HI> Melchizedek. <HI>Therefore doth my Father love me, becau&s;e I lay down my Life, this Commandment I have received of my Father.</HI> The&s;e Scriptures and many others that might be mentioned, do &s;ufficiently &s;hew <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Authority and Commi&s;&s;ion to mediate.</P>
<P>GOD the Father in this Con&s;titution, is to be con&s;idered as a Governor, who by an Act of Supremacy and pure Juri&s;diction, may di&s;pen&s;e with the Execution of the Law, upon &s;uch Con&s;i|derations, as fully an&s;wer the Ends of Government.</P>
<P>THE Law is not executed according to the Letter of it, for that obliges the Per&s;on that Sins to &s;uffer, and if the Ca&s;e were &s;o no Fle&s;h could be &s;aved; nor is it di&s;annull'd, for if &s;o no Obligation to Duty or Penalty would remain, but all Men are o|bliged to obey, and tho&s;e who impenitently neglect it, are under a Cur&s;e, it is therefore only relax'd in regard of its Penalty, by a merciful Conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Lawgiver.</P>
<P>IT is true the <HI>Moral Law</HI> cannot be relaxed, in re&s;pect of its <HI>Precept;</HI> for that being a <HI>Copy</HI> of the divine <HI>Purity,</HI> the Al|mighty cannot deny him&s;elf by contradicting it, or allowing what is intrin&s;ically Evil; nor can it be relaxed in Re&s;pect of the <HI>Sub|&s;tance</HI> and Weight of its Penalty in general, becau&s;e of the <HI>Ju&s;|tice</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> of GOD engaged to i&s;&s;ue the &s;ame.</P>
<P>YET that the Penalty may be relaxed, as to the Per&s;on of the Sinner, for wi&s;e and ju&s;t Rea&s;ons, is evident by con&s;idering, that it is not the Evil of the Offender, that is primarily de&s;igned by it, but the Honour of the Lawgiver, and the Pre&s;ervation of pub|lick Order and Government; in ca&s;e therefore tho&s;e valuable Ends can be attain'd, by &s;ub&s;tituting a Surety in the Place of the Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or to &s;uffer for him; the End of the Law is an&s;wered.</P>
<P>ALTHO' the Threatning declared the Demerit of Sin in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and the Right of Puni&s;hing in the Creator and So|vereign, yet it cannot vacate GOD'S Power to relax it upon ju&s;t and wi&s;e Rea&s;ons; otherwi&s;e it would be ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent with his Supremacy.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t <HI>Pre-requi&s;ite</HI> that I mentioned, was the REDEEMERS <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> to the Fathers Appointment; this was nece&s;&s;ary to make his Sufferings &s;atisfactory; for being GOD him&s;elf he could not be compelled by any &s;uperior Authority&punc; its true, after he had undertaken, he was then obliged to pay the Debt; but his fir&s;t Engagement was altogether free and of Choice.</P>
<P>AND &s;eeing that the <HI>Vertue</HI> of his Sufferings does not ari&s;e meerly from the Dignity of his Per&s;on, but from his Sub&s;titution in our &s;tead, this rendered his Con&s;ent likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary; his &s;uf|ferings for others without his Con&s;ent, if he could have been com|pell'd thereto, would have been liable to the Charge of Inju&s;tice; and therefore the Scriptures expre&s;sly declare his willingne&s;s to undertake the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mediation, Burnt-offering, and Sin-offer|ing thou did&s;t not require, <HI>then &s;aid I, lo I come, in the Volumn

of the Book it is written of me,</HI> I <HI>delight to do thy Will, O my God, yea, thy Law is within my Heart.</HI> And hence it is &s;aid, that he <HI>gave him&s;elf for us;</HI> and that on this Account, the <HI>Father loved him, becau&s;e he laid down his Life;</HI> the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture do &s;ufficiently manife&s;t <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s free, and full Con&s;ent to the Fathers Appointment, of his undertaking to be our Surety.</P>
<P>NOW having &s;poken of the Pre-requi&s;ites nece&s;&s;ary in order to Satisfaction; it is proper to di&s;cour&s;e on the Account which the Scriptures give of the Redeemer's Death, to the End we may know whether it was &s;atisfactory or not, and to &s;hew how divine Ju&s;tice is therein glorified. Now the Scriptures repre&s;ent the Death of CHRIST under a threefold Character, <HI>viz.</HI> as a Puni&s;hment inflicted for Sin, as a Price to redeem us from Ruin, and as a Sacrifice to reconcile us to God. And</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is repre&s;ented as a Puni&s;hment for Sin, this will appear by con&s;idering,</P>
<P>THAT Man on account of his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, was &s;entenced by the Law he broke to Death; and being in&s;olvent, the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> by his Father's Appointment and his own Con&s;ent, engaged as a Surety to pay the Debt; and hence he is call'd the Surety of a better Covenant, and he is &s;aid to be made under the Law, that we might obtain the Adoption of Sons; he who was God over all ble&s;&s;ed forever, was in re&s;pect of his human Nature, and as Mediator, &s;ubject to its Precepts, and liable to its Penalties, that by performing the one and &s;u&s;taining the other, he might redeem tho&s;e that were under the Law.</P>
<P>THE Debt we ow'd was not pecuniary but penal, a Creditor may forgive the former without Payment, becau&s;e it is his Pro|perty, but the latter cannot be forgiven without the Prince's Con|&s;ent, who is Guardian of the <HI>Laws,</HI> becau&s;e publick Ju&s;tice is concerned in it.</P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST having a&s;&s;um'd the Relation of a SURETY, be|came one with the Debtor, in the Judgment of the <HI>Law;</HI> and &s;o was liable to their Puni&s;hment according to <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>AND this Puni&s;hment the Scriptures a&s;&s;ure us, GOD as a &s;u|preame Judge inflicted upon him; and hence he is &s;aid to be deli|vered up by the Determinate Council of GOD, and that the Lord laid upon him the Iniquities of us all, that is the Guilt of them, and Puni&s;hment due for them. It is farther &s;aid, that it plea&s;ed the Lord to brui&s;e him, and el&s;ewhere that the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> was cut of but not for him&s;elf&punc; that he was wounded for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, bruis'd for our Iniquities, that the Cha&s;ti&s;ement of our Peace was laid upon him, and that by his Stripes we are heal'd; that he him&s;elf bare our Sins on his own Body on the Tree. Moreover the Sufferings CHRIST endur'd, were an&s;werable to the Penalty the Law de|nounc'd, in Sub&s;tance, the Death threatn'd was both Temporal and Spiritual, and thus our Lord, not only bore a Temporal Death, accompanied with great Di&s;honour, and exqui&s;ite Angui&s;h, but likewi&s;e with the Cur&s;e of GOD, and he al&s;o bore the Wrath of
<PB N="12" REF="006426_0011_1028E49B8BA896B0">
<HI>Jehovah</HI> upon his Soul, and hence he is &s;aid to <HI>tread the Wine Pre&s;s of it alone:</HI>&mdash; The FEAR and SORROW of CHRIST at the approach of his Sufferings as well as his BLOODY SWEAT and Lamentation under them, &s;hew'd that he endur'd &s;omething more terrible then all outward Torments, for the Martyrs have en|dur'd &s;uch with triumph, and &s;urely our Redeemer cou'd not have le&s;s courage then they, who was the Source of their For|titude; the Difference then mu&s;t be in the Nature of their Suf|ferings, GOD the Father dealt with him as our SURETY, and not as his own SON; and therefore &s;u&s;pended a comfortable Sen&s;e of his Love, and appear'd as a &s;evere inexorable Judge: Now from the afore&s;aid Account of the Sufferings of CHRIST, it is evident they were PENAL; &s;eeing they were inflicted for Sin by the Supreme Judge, and were equivalent to the Sentence of the Law, and we receive &s;piritual and &s;pecial Benefits by them.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Chri&s;t's Sufferings</HI> we may ob&s;erve the <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Form</HI> and <HI>Ends</HI> of Puni&s;hment. The <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> is &s;omething afflic|tive, either privative in being deprived of &s;ome good, or po&s;itive in enduring &s;omething grievous, both which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> bore. The <HI>form</HI> of Puni&s;hment is when it is Inflicted for Sin, and this di&s;tingui&s;hes it from a Calamity. Now <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;uffer'd Death for Sin not his own, and hence he is &s;aid to bear our Sins, to be delivered up to Death for our Sins, yea, to be made Sin and a Cur&s;e for US. The <HI>End</HI> of <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> is the common good, partly in deterring Per&s;ons from violating the Laws, which is the de&s;ign of exemplary Puni&s;hment, and partly in maintaining the Honour and Intere&s;t of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered by the Breach of the Laws, this is the De&s;ign of Sa|tisfactory Puni&s;hment, an&s;werable to which in the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the Severity there expre&s;s'd is to deter from Sin, and maintain the Honour of the great Lord of the Univer&s;e, by making com|pen&s;ation for the Injury done again&s;t him by Sin.</P>
<P>2dly. THE DEATH of CHRIST is repre&s;ented in Scripture as the PRICE of our <HI>Redemption: Redemption</HI> in general is a deliver|ing of one from a Calamity by a <HI>Ran&s;om, i. e.</HI> Some valuable Con&s;ideration, which is term'd a Price; to under&s;tand which let it be con&s;idered, that Man by Di&s;obedience to GOD was bro't into Mi&s;ery, &s;uch Mi&s;ery as the Scripture often expre&s;&s;es by Captivity, which con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;ervile Subjection to Satan and Death, to which Man was as it were committed for his Rebellion by the Supreame Judge and Governor; from this Calamity Men could no otherwi&s;e be delivered then by Ran&s;om, for by Order of Divine Ju&s;tice we were detain'd Pri&s;oners, and till this was Satisfy'd, no Di&s;charge could be obtain'd; freedom from a Calamity without a Price is Deliverance &s;imply, but not properly Redemption: The Word Re|demption to which the Scriptures a&s;cribe our e&s;cape <HI>(apolutro&s;is)</HI> &s;ignifies Deliverance by a Ran&s;om; and hence it is &s;aid, <HI>that CHRIST gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for all, (antilutron)</HI> This Word is exceeding Emphatical, and &s;ignifies a Ran&s;om paid in&s;tead of another. <HI>Anti</HI> denotes Sub&s;titution, when a Thing or
<PB N="13" REF="006426_0012_1028E4A25953B038">
Per&s;on is put in the Place of another; many In&s;tances might ea&s;ily be given of this, &s;o that the Meaning of the afore&s;aid Words, he gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;on for many, is this, that he died in their &s;tead, and by his Life as a Price obtained their Redemption; which Truth the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> el&s;ewhere confirms, by &s;aying that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has Redeem'd us from the Cur&s;e of the Law, being made a Cur&s;e for us; the Price upon Con&s;ideration of which we are Redeem'd, <HI>is not corruptable Things &s;uch as Silver and Gold, but the precious Blood of CHRIST as of a Lamb without blemi&s;h and without Spot,</HI> this Price was paid in our &s;tead to GOD, for it was for Sin again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, that we were ca&s;t into Mi&s;ery, and by his Righteous Order detained in it; and therefore to him the Price of our acquitance mu&s;t be paid; Satan is no more then an In|&s;trument of his Ju&s;tice: If CHRIST had died only for the Confirmation of the Go&s;pel, or to exhibit to us a Patern of Suffering, as the <HI>Socinians</HI> imagine, then what was there in his Death more than in the Death of other Martyrs, and how can we be &s;aid to be <HI>redeem'd</HI> by it? Would it not be as ridiculous as bla&s;phemous to &s;ay, that we are redeemed by their Death? But</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is repre&s;ented in Scripture, as a Sacri|fice to reconcile us to God; him Jehovah <HI>has &s;et forth to be a Propitiation thro' Faith in his Blood.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was a true and real <HI>Sacrifice</HI> appears not only from the expre&s;s Declaration of Scripture, but from all the Ingredients of a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> being found in it, Chri&s;t <HI>our Pa&s;&s;over,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians, is &s;acrificed for us;</HI> and in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> he informs us, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath appeared once in the End of the World to put away Sin by the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>ONE <HI>Ingredient</HI> of a real and proper <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> was that the Per|&s;on offering mu&s;t be a Prie&s;t, <HI>every high Prie&s;t,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>taken from among Men is ordained for Men in Things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins;</HI> and was not <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> con&s;titued a Prie&s;t by Oath after the Order of <HI>Melchizedeck.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, The Things offered were to be of God's appointment, otherwi&s;e it was but Will-wor&s;hip, even in freewill Offerings, tho' the Time of Offering was not fixed, yet the Things to be Offered were appointed; and thus was not what CHRIST offered, appointed and prepared by God, <HI>a Body ha&s;t thou prepared me,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t; this Body was animated with a Soul, which being &s;e|parated therefrom in his Death, is &s;aid to be <HI>made an Offering for Sin,</HI> by the Royal Prophet; and el&s;ewhere he is &s;aid to <HI>offer him|&s;elf,</HI> i. e. both his Soul and Body, (<HI>Heb.</HI> ix.)</P>
<P>FARTHER, that which was offered for a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> was to be de|&s;troy'd; tho&s;e Things that had life were kill'd, and their Blood pour'd out, and the other Parts be&s;ides the Blood were burnt, either wholy or in part: Thus our Lord was &s;lain and his Blood &s;hed, and his Soul was expo&s;ed to his Fathers Wrath. And as the Jewi&s;h <HI>Sacrifices</HI> were burnt without the Camp: Thus did not JESUS &s;uffer <HI>without the Gates of Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Moreover,
<PB N="14" REF="006426_0013_1028E4A52A429A80">
<HI>Sacrifices</HI> were offered to God only, and hence the Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> terms them <HI>Things pertaining to God:</HI> And did not JESUS CHRIST, thro the eternal Spirit, offer him&s;elf <HI>without Spot to God,</HI> (<HI>Heb,</HI> ix. 14.)</P>
<P>FROM the afore&s;aid Particulars it appears, that all the <HI>Ingredients</HI> or <HI>Con&s;tituents,</HI> of a real <HI>Sacrifice</HI> are found in the Sacrifice of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING already &s;hewn that CHRIST'S Death was a <HI>real Sacri|fice,</HI> I would proceed to a&s;&s;ert and prove, that it was a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Propitiation</HI> or <HI>Attonement</HI> and <HI>Reconciliation.</HI></P>
<P>TO this End ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Propitiatory Sacrifices</HI> under the Jewi&s;h OEconomy, were figures and &s;hadows of the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Now if the Types and Shadows had any propitiatory Vertue in them, much more the Antitype, el&s;e the Sub&s;tance would not exceed the Shadow, which is ab&s;urd. That the Jewi&s;h <HI>Sacri|fices</HI> did prefigure the Death of Chri&s;t, the Apo&s;tle declares at large in the ninth and tenth Chapters to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and in the &s;econd Chapter of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Colo&s;ians,</HI> where he calls them <HI>Figures and Shadows of good Things to come:</HI> but in the mean Time ob|&s;erves, that <HI>the Body is of</HI> Chri&s;t; as if he &s;hould &s;ay, tho&s;e Propitiatory Jewi&s;h Sacrifices had &s;ome re&s;emblance of this, as the &s;hadow has of the Body, tho' ob&s;cure and imperfect; but the Sub&s;tance and Perfection of Atonement is in the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to make this very important Point more evident, let me endeavour to prove, that all that was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of Propitiation under the Jewi&s;h OEconomy, is to be found in the Sacrifice of Chri&s;t, <HI>e. g.</HI> The Sin of the Offender was laid upon the Sacrifice, and likewi&s;e his Puni&s;hment was inflicted upon it, the Sacrifice was &s;ub&s;tituted in his Room, apea&s;ed the Almighty, and removed the Sinners guilt.</P>
<P>EACH of the&s;e Particulars de&s;erves and requires our Attention. The Sin of the Offender was laid upon the Sacrifice, or imputed to it and charged upon it, &s;o as to be made re&s;pon&s;ible and liable to &s;uffer for it, as if it had contracted the Guilt it&s;elf; even as a Surety is obliged to pay a Debt he never contracted, yea as much as if he had: The <HI>Sacrifice</HI> was look'd upon and treated as a guilty Thing, tho' it had not &s;in'd it&s;elf; hence the&s;e <HI>Sacrifices</HI> were called <HI>Sins,</HI> (<HI>Levit.</HI> xx. 17.) which is tran&s;lated <HI>Sin-Offering.</HI> Farther they are &s;aid to bear the Iniquities of the People, (<HI>Levit.</HI> xvi. 22.) <HI>and the Goat &s;hall bear upon him all their Iniquities.</HI> We are farther informed in the afore&s;aid Chapter, that the People laid their Hands upon the Head of the Sacrifice, confe&s;&s;ed their Sins over him, and put their Sins upon him; <HI>and</HI> Aaron <HI>&s;hall lay both his Hands upon the Head of the live Goat, and confe&s;s over him all the Iniquities of the Children of I&s;rael.</HI> Putting them upon the Head of the Goat, &s;ignified, &s;ay the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Ma&s;ters, that the Guilt was transferred from the People to the Sacrifice that was offered for them. And hence the Scape Goat, and other Propitiatory Sacrifices, were look'd upon as execrable and poluted Things; and tho&s;e that touch'd them were poluted. (<HI>Levit.</HI> xxvi.)
<PB N="15" REF="006426_0014_1028E4A7CA391C78">
Now as the Sin was charged upon and imputed to the legal Sacri|fices, &s;o our Sins were charged upon and imputed to JESUS CHRIST, as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves to the <HI>Corinthians, he was made Sin for us who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</HI> How could he be made Sin who knew none, any other way than by Imputation? And how can his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, who is God, be made ours by any other Method? Sin was imputed to Chri&s;t when it was charged upon him, and he obliged to &s;uffer for it in our &s;tead; as a Debt may be &s;aid to be imputed to a Surety when he takes it upon him&s;elf, and is thereby obliged to pay it, tho' he never contracted it; and <HI>Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is imputed to us when it is accepted for us, and we as realy entitled to its Benefits as tho' we had perform'd it. Moreover,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Penalty</HI> of the Offender was laid upon the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> offered for him; the Sinner de&s;erved temporal Death and De&s;truction, and the Sacrifice was &s;lain or de&s;troy'd. A Bullock, which was a Sin-Offerring for the High-Prie&s;t, and a Goat, which was a Sin-Offering for the People, were ordered to be killed, and the Scape Goat was &s;ent into the Wilderne&s;s to be de&s;troy'd one way or other. (<HI>See Levit.</HI> xvi) And in like manner the Sin-Offerings for private Per&s;ons whether Lambs, Kids, Turtle-Doves, or Young Pidegons, were to be &s;lain, and the Offering of Flour was to be partly con|&s;umed. (<HI>Levit.</HI> v.)</P>
<P>THE Sacrifices, by having the Sins of the People laid upon them, became liable to the Penalty, and did actually under go it: Thus it was with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> whom they pointed to; <HI>he him&s;elf,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter, bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, by who&s;e &s;tripes we are healed; he was brui&s;ed for our Iniquities,</HI> &s;aith the Prophet, <HI>wounded for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and poured out his Soul unto Death.</HI> Farther,</P>
<P>THE Sacrifice &s;uffered the afore&s;aid Penalties in the Offenders room and place, and this indeed nece&s;&s;arily follows from the Par|ticulars beforementioned, for to &s;uffer in one's &s;tead is nothing el&s;e but to &s;uffer for another what he &s;hould have &s;uffered, that he may e&s;cape; thus the Sacrifice &s;uffered Death for the Offender that he might not die, and therefore dy'd in his &s;tead, its Life went for his Life, <HI>Levit.</HI> xvii. 11. <HI>For the Life of the Fle&s;h is in the Blood, and I have given it to you upon the Altar to make an Atonement.</HI> The Blood being the Vehickle of Life, when it goes, the Life goes; this therefore being offered to attone for them, or &s;ave their Lives, of Con&s;equence the Life of the Sa|crifice went in&s;tead of the Life of the Offender.</P>
<P>AND if, as has been before proved, both the Sin and Puni&s;h|ment of the Offender were laid upon the Sacrifice, it mu&s;t needs &s;uffer in his room and place; but for farther Illu&s;tration of this important Point of the Sub&s;titution of the Sacrifice in the Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors room, it may be ob&s;erved, that no Sacrifices were in&s;tituted for Capital Offences, &s;uch as Murder, Idolatry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e the Sinner him&s;elf was to be cut off; but for other Sins which tho'
<PB N="16" REF="006426_0015_1028E4B12446F4F0">
they in &s;trictne&s;s according to that Di&s;pen&s;ation, de&s;erved Death, yet God was plea&s;ed to relax the Penalty of the Law in Re&s;pect of the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and accept of the Life of the Sacrifice for his Life: Agreeable hereto the guilty Per&s;on was to offer a clean Bea&s;t of his own, to &s;ignify its Sub&s;titution in his &s;tead, for as Proprietor he had a Dominion over it to apply it to that U&s;e.</P>
<P>WELL; if there was in the Sacrifices of Attonement a Sub&s;ti|tution of the Sacrifice in the Offender's room, and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was &s;uch a Sacrifice as has been proved, then it nece&s;&s;arily follows that he died not only for our Good, but in our room and place, &s;eeing he is the Sub&s;tance and Anti-type to which tho&s;e Shadows pointed, and in whom they have their Accompli&s;hment; and hence he is &s;aid <HI>to die for the Ungodly,</HI> and to &s;uffer the ju&s;t for the un|ju&s;t that he might bring us to GOD, ju&s;t as the innocent Sacri|fice in the room of the guilty Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, not only the original Words in tho&s;e Scriptures <HI>Huper</HI> and <HI>Anti,</HI> but the Things &s;poken of manife&s;tly declare a Sub&s;titution of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the Place of Sinners as a Sacrifice of Propitiation.</P>
<P>AGAIN, <HI>propitiatory Sacrifices</HI> were to appea&s;e God and turn away his Anger, this is the Meaning of the Word <HI>Attonement,</HI> which was the De&s;ign of the <HI>Sin-Offerings,</HI> the <HI>Tre&s;pa&s;s-Offerings&punc;</HI> and the <HI>Burnt-Offerings,</HI> Levit. vii. 7. and i. 4. <HI>And he &s;hall put his Hand upon the Head of the Burnt-Offering, and it &s;hall be accepted for him to make Attonement for him.</HI> And this was al&s;o the De&s;ign of the <HI>Peace-Offerings,</HI> and this End tho&s;e Sacri+fices attained, many Examples of this Kind might be offered but I &s;hall only, for brevity's &s;ake, mention one, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxiv. ult. <HI>And</HI> David <HI>offered Burnt-Offerings and Peace-Offerings&punc; &s;o the Lord was intreated for the Land, and the Plague was &s;tayed from</HI> I&s;rael. Becau&s;e the Lord by tho&s;e Sacrifices was rendered propitious or well plea&s;ed, therefore they are frequently &s;aid to be of a <HI>&s;weet &s;avour to the Lord,</HI> Levit. i. <HI>Noah</HI>'s Sacrifice is &s;aid to be <HI>a &s;avour of Re&s;t,</HI> as it is in the Margin, <HI>Gen.</HI> viii. 21. on which Occa&s;ion <HI>God</HI> &s;aid <HI>he would not cur&s;e the Ground any more for Man</HI>'s <HI>&s;ake.</HI> It is call'd a &s;avour of Re&s;t, becau&s;e when <HI>God</HI> is pacify'd, his Anger re&s;ts, <HI>Ezek.</HI> xvi. 42. Hence tho&s;e Sacrifices are call'd <HI>propitiatory.</HI> The Words <HI>Propitiation, Attonement, Re|conciliation, Pacifying,</HI> are &s;ynonimous Terms, and &s;ignify one and the &s;ame Thing.</P>
<P>NOW the &s;ame Words and Effects are a&s;cribed to the Sacrifice of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> (or to his <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> which is the &s;ame) in our Text he is &s;aid to be a <HI>Propitiatory thro' Faith in his Blood,</HI> by him, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Romans, we have received the At|tonement, Rom.</HI> xi. He is called our <HI>Peace, Ephe&s;.</HI> ii. 14. And the Cha&s;ti&s;ement of our Peace is &s;aid to be laid upon him, <HI>i. e.</HI> Puni&s;hments nece&s;&s;ary to procure our Peace, and by his Blood and Death we are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified and reconciled. <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 9.10.</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to this Reconciliation, Satisfaction to Ju&s;tice was nece&s;&s;ary, which implies not only the Suffering of a Calamity,
<PB N="17" REF="006426_0016_1028E4B35B63A860">
but that in Sub&s;tance, which the <HI>Law</HI> threatned and the Sinner de&s;erved. <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> that it may be &s;atisfied requires the Execution of the <HI>Law,</HI> and the Calamity afore&s;aid mu&s;t be endured by the Sinner, and in his &s;tead by another, if one &s;uffers upon his own Account, that can be no Satisfaction for another, all the&s;e Parti|culars we have already proved, are verified in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Sacri|fices, and in the Sub&s;tance which they prefigured.</P>
<P>ONCE more I may ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Sacrifices removed Guilt or Obligation to Puni&s;hment, here ob&s;erve, that Guilt may be &s;aid to be threefold, <HI>viz. Civil, Ceremonial,</HI> and <HI>Moral. Civil</HI> Guilt con&s;i&s;ted in a liablene&s;s to temporal Death, for &s;ome viola|tion of the civil or judicial <HI>Law, Deut.</HI> xxi. 9.</P>
<P>CEREMONIAL Guilt con&s;i&s;ted in an Obligation to be debarr'd from the Privileges of publick Wor&s;hip under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Oecono|my for &s;ome Breach of the ceremonial <HI>Law,</HI> for &s;ome legal Pol|lution, <HI>Levit.</HI> 5. But,</P>
<P>MORAL <HI>Guilt</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in an Obligation to endure eternal Death for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the <HI>moral Law,</HI> for by divine Con&s;titution the Wa|ges of every moral Evil or Sin properly and intrin&s;ically &s;o call'd is Death; now the legal Sacrifices could free from the two former Kinds of <HI>Guilt,</HI> but the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone from the latter, <HI>Heb.</HI> ix. 13, 14. <HI>For if the Blood of Goats, and A&s;hes of a Heifer &s;prinkling of the Unclean, &s;anctifieth to the purifying of the Fle&s;h,</HI> i. e. promoted an external Sanctification or Expiation, as to the Fle&s;h, not as to the Soul and Con&s;cience, <HI>How much more &s;hall the Blood of</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>purge your Con&s;ciences from dead Works.</HI></P>
<P>THE legal Sacrifices could not make him that did the Service, perfect, as pertaining to the Con&s;cience, becau&s;e they could not compen&s;ate the Injury Sin had done to GOD, being finite, without which, <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> is engaged to puni&s;h the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or with eternal Death.</P>
<P>THESE Sacrifices could only remove a civil and ceremonial <HI>Guilt,</HI> or liablene&s;s to outward Puni&s;hment enacted by tho&s;e Laws&punc; (in In&s;tances not grounded upon the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things, but meerly upon divine Sovereignity;) and &s;hadow forth the Sacri|fice of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which being of infinite Value is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy divine Ju&s;tice, remove the Guilt of moral Impurity, and &s;ave the Soul: Under the Law we are told, <HI>that without the &s;hedding of Blood there was no remi&s;&s;ion of Sins,</HI> and the Blood is &s;aid to make Attonement, <HI>Levit.</HI> xvii 11. the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the Life was in the Blood, and therefore when the Blood was offered to make Attonement for the Offender, the Life of the Sacrifice was &s;uppos'd to be given in&s;tead of his Life, and thus the Sentence of the Law threatning Death was executed, and &s;o <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> &s;atisfied. For this Rea&s;on the Blood of the Mediator is &s;aid to <HI>&s;peak better Things than the Blood of</HI> Abel, for that cry'd for Revenge, but this procures Remi&s;&s;ion to Believers; and this doubtle&s;s is the Rea&s;on why &s;o frequent mention is made of the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in
<PB N="18" REF="006426_0017_1028E4B9998595A8">
the <HI>New-Te&s;tament, viz.</HI> to &s;hew that our dear Redeemer has en|dured the <HI>Penalty</HI> of the Law, Death it&s;elf, and thereby &s;atisfied <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> magnified the <HI>Law,</HI> and made it honourable.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Reality</HI> and <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Satisfaction to Ju&s;tice appears, not only from what has been &s;aid upon the &s;criptural Repre&s;entation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Death as a Puni&s;hment inflicted for Sin, as a Price to redeem us from Ruin, and a Sacrifice to reconcile us to GOD, but likewi&s;e from the Con&s;ideration of the Quality of the Per&s;on &s;uffering, the Degrees of his Sufferings, and the Effects of them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Quality</HI> of his Per&s;on derived an infinite Value upon his Sufferings. Our Redeemer was the true and eternal GOD, co-equal and co-eternal with his Father, <HI>the Brightne&s;s of his Glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on,</HI> the Son of GOD, not meerly by Office, but by Nature, and therefore was able to make full Sa|tisfaction for our <HI>Sins.</HI> The <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of all Nations agree that Puni&s;hments receive their E&s;timate from the Quality of the Per&s;ons that &s;uffer: Tho' the Deity is impa&s;&s;ible, yet it was a divine Per&s;on that &s;uffered, and hence his Blood is call'd the <HI>Blood of GOD,</HI> in Scripture, this made his Sufferings of infinite Worth.</P>
<P>NOR was there any Defect in the Payment he made, we ow'd a Debt of <HI>Death</HI> to the <HI>Law,</HI> and his <HI>Life</HI> was offered up as a <HI>Sacrifice;</HI> yea, <HI>he trod the Wine-pre&s;s of his Father</HI>'s <HI>Anger,</HI> and his divine Nature communicated an infinite Dignity to his Suffer|ings, &s;o that they were in Kind, Degree, and Value, &s;uited to the Sentence of the violated <HI>Law,</HI> equal to the Demerit of <HI>Sin,</HI> and con&s;equently &s;atisfactory to divine <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> provoked by it.</P>
<P>BUT methinks, the Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Con&s;equents</HI> and <HI>Effects</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Death pours more Light upon this important Subject, and clearly proves the &s;ufficiency of his Satisfaction to <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>NOW there are the&s;e three Con&s;equences of his Death that de&s;erve our pre&s;ent Attention, <HI>viz.</HI> his <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> from the Grave, his <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> into Heaven, and <HI>Exaltation</HI> to the Father's Right Hand.</P>
<P>OUR Lord, in Quality of our <HI>Surety,</HI> was arre&s;ted by <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> and detain'd as Pri&s;oner in the Grave, till he had by his Death &s;atisfied the <HI>Law</HI> and paid our Debt; upon which he received a Di&s;charge in his <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> and hence the rai&s;ing of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is a&s;cribed to GOD as reconciled, <HI>Now the God of Peace, who brought again from the Dead the great Shepherd of the Sheep, thro' the Blood of the everla&s;ting Covenant;</HI> be&s;ides it is a&s;cribed to his Blood becau&s;e that was the full Price of his and our Liberty. <HI>Ju&s;tice incen&s;ed</HI> arre&s;ted and &s;lew him, but <HI>Ju&s;tice &s;atisfied</HI> gave him a Relea&s;e and Acquittance, of which his <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> is a clear Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us</HI> having ri&s;en from the Dead, a&s;cended into Heaven as our High Prie&s;t, there to interceed for us: Now his Admi&s;&s;ion into Heaven, after he had undertaken to be our <HI>Surety,</HI> is a full and certain Proof that he has faithfully di&s;charged that
<PB N="19" REF="006426_0018_1028E4C3B906F020">
important Tru&s;t, this is doubtle&s;s the Meaning of the&s;e Words of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> John xvi. 10. He <HI>&s;hall convince the World of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, becau&s;e I go to my Father,</HI> i. e. the holy Spirit &s;hall convince and per&s;uade Sinners of the Compleatne&s;s of my per&s;onal and media|torial Righteou&s;ne&s;s, by the Argument of my a&s;cending to and being accepted of my Father, for without this he would exclude me from his divine Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>AFTER the <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> had offered Sacrifices without at the Altar, for the Sins of the People, he opened the Vail and entered into the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> and there offered &s;weet Incen&s;e and the Blood of Sacrifices to render GOD propitious to them, (<HI>Levit.</HI> xvi. 14, 15.) The&s;e Things were Figures of what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was to perform, the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> was a Type of the third Heaven, as that had a double Vail which &s;eparated it from the inner Temple, and the outward Court, &s;o is the third Heaven &s;eparated from the Earth by the double Vail of the &s;tarry Heavens and airy Regions, none that was impure might enter into the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> and into Heaven, we are told that <HI>no unclean Thing can enter;</HI> there was the Throne of GOD, for as the P&s;almi&s;t ob&s;erves, <HI>He dwells between the Cherubims,</HI> there the Tables of the Law, the Em|blems of divine Wi&s;dom and Purity, there the Cherubims the Figures of the ble&s;&s;ed Angels, there the <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> entered with the Blood of the Sacrifice, carrying the Names of the twelve Tribes upon his <HI>Brea&s;t-plate.</HI></P>
<P>THUS our great <HI>High Prie&s;t,</HI> after having by the Sacrifice of him|&s;elf without the Gates of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> attoned for the Sins of his People, entered into the eternal Sanctuary with his own Blood, <HI>bearing on his Bo&s;om the Names of all the redeemed,</HI> and taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Heaven for them in their Names, and there offering their Supplications to his Father, perfumed with the Incen&s;e of his Merits. Of this there was a miraculous &s;ign given at his <HI>Crucifixion,</HI> for in the Moment he expired, <HI>the Vail of the Tem|ple was rent from the Top to the Bottom,</HI> to &s;ignify that the great <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> had Authority to enter into Heaven it&s;elf as our Surety, and that his De&s;ign herein was to appear in the Pre&s;ence of God for us as the Lamb &s;lain, (<HI>Heb.</HI> ix. 24.)</P>
<P>AS our LORD purcha&s;ed <HI>Salvation</HI> for us, by the real Sacrifice of him&s;elf upon the Earth, &s;o he applies it to us by his Interce&s;|&s;ion in Heaven, which is a Commemoration of that Sacrifice; and therefore he is &s;aid to appear before his Father by <HI>Sacrifice.</HI> (<HI>Heb.</HI> ix.)</P>
<P><HI>IF any Man &s;in, we have an Advocate with the Father,</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>the Righteous.</HI> His <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion</HI> is attended with Maje&s;ty and Efficacy: He does not now &s;upplicate with <HI>&s;trong crying and tears,</HI> as in the Days of his Fle&s;h, but <HI>Wills</HI> Salvation to his People, <HI>Father I will that tho&s;e thou ha&s;t given me be with me, that they may behold my Glory.</HI> Nor does his Suit ever fail of <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> for it is ju&s;t, he asks nothing but what he has bought by Blood. Moreover, he is nearly related to the eternal Father, and has an
<PB N="20" REF="006426_0019_1028E4C55214AD68">
inexpre&s;&s;ible Intere&s;t in his Affection; and hence we are told, that <HI>him the Father heareth always.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER, the pre&s;ent <HI>Exaltation</HI> of our <HI>Redeemer</HI> to the highe&s;t Degree of Dignity, Glory and Dominion, is a certain Argument of the &s;ufficiency of his <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to Ju&s;tice by his obedient Suf|ferings, becau&s;e it was promi&s;ed to and conferred upon him by his Father as a Reward thereof.</P>
<P>THAT he is now advanced to the highe&s;t <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Dominion,</HI> is evident from the&s;e Scriptures, (Ephe&s;. i.) <HI>When he rai&s;ed him from the Dead, and &s;et him at his own right Hand in heavenly Places, far above all principality and Power, and Might and Do|minion; and every Name that is named, not only in this World but al&s;o in that which is to come, and hath put all Things under his Feet, and gave him to be the Head over all Things to the Church.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the Father promi&s;ed to him, as <HI>Mediator,</HI> the afore&s;aid Dignities as a Reward, and con&s;equent of his Humiliation, is like|wi&s;e evident from the&s;e Places of Scripture, (<HI>Luke</HI> xxiv. 26.) <HI>Ought not</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>to have &s;uffered and to enter into his Glory:</HI> This doubtle&s;s refers to the Covenant of Redemption between the Fa|ther and the Son, before all Worlds, wherein the Son engaged to &s;uffer for Sinners, and the Father promi&s;ed to reward him for it; for without Reference had hereto, there was no Obligation either upon the Father or the Son in the&s;e re&s;pects, See al&s;o <HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 8.9. <HI>He humbled him&s;elf and became obedient unto Death; wherefore God hath al&s;o highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is a|bove every Name, that at the Name of</HI> Je&s;us <HI>every Knee &s;hould bow.</HI> Heb. i. 3. <HI>When he had by him&s;elf purged our Sins, he &s;at down on the right Hand of the Maje&s;ty on high.</HI></P>
<P>NOW &s;eeing the afore&s;aid Exaltation, of being Head of the Church, and Lord of the Univer&s;e, was promi&s;ed to the <HI>Mediator</HI> as a Reward and Con&s;equent of his Sufferings and Satisfaction; fora&s;much as it is di&s;pen&s;ed, it is a &s;ufficient Proof that the Con|dition is perform'd, on which the Promi&s;e was &s;u&s;pended, or in other Words, of the certainty and &s;ufficiency of CHRIST'S Satis|faction to Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Effects</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Death, are likewi&s;e Evidences of his <HI>Satisfaction</HI> by it, and therefore give farther force to this Argu|ment. The La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> made nothing Perfect, all it's Sacrifices and Ce|remonies could not cancel the Guilt, or clean&s;e the &s;tain of moral Impurity, nor open Heaven for us, all which are nece&s;&s;ary to our Perfection. But CHRIST <HI>by one Offering hath perfected forever them that are &s;anctified;</HI> he hath acquired for his People, acquit|ance from the Guilt of Sin, deliverance from its Stain and Domi|nion, and a final Admi&s;&s;ion into the Imperial Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Death of JESUS has blotted out the Hand-Writing of Or|dinances which was contrary to us, and took it out of the Way, hailing it to his Cro&s;s <HI>i. e.</HI> entirely cancelled the condemnatory Sentence of the Law as to Believers; for in the afore&s;aid Terms there is a manife&s;t allu&s;ion to the Defacing and De&s;truction of
<PB N="21" REF="006426_0020_1028E4C7A41D6838">
obligatory Bonds. In the End of the World our great high Prie&s;t appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of him&s;elf; <HI>his Blood clean&s;eth from all Sin,</HI> and not only extends its Efficacy to all Time pa&s;t, but will to all Time coming; and hence he is &s;aid <HI>to be the &s;ame Ye&s;terday to-day and forever, able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to the Father by him.</HI></P>
<P>NOR is the Death of CHRIST le&s;s efficacious in removing the Dominion and Stain of Sin, for by it the &s;anctifying Influences of the Holy Spirit are procured, <HI>whereby we are renewed after the Image of God, and made meet for Communion with him;</HI> hence it was that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> promi&s;ed the <HI>Comforter</HI> as a con&s;equent of his A&s;cen&s;ion. (<HI>John</HI> xvi.) Hence we are &s;aid <HI>to be &s;anctifyed in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and <HI>to have our Robes made white in the Blood of the Lamb.</HI> (Rev. vii. 14.)</P>
<P>AND is it not thro' the <HI>Blood of</HI> CHRIST <HI>that we have bold|ne&s;s to enter into the holie&s;t?</HI> (Heb. x. 19) Which is a clear E|vidence of the compleat <HI>Satisfaction</HI> made by it: For without this, Ju&s;tice would never &s;uffer the Privilege of the Righteous to be confered on the guilty and depraved. To this very Purpo&s;e the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf argues, (Heb. v. 9.) <HI>He learned Obedience by the Things which he &s;uffered, and being made Perfect, he became the Author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</HI> The meaning of which is, that there was Obedience to the Fathers ap|pointment in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Sufferings, and that after he had perfected the End de&s;igned by them, which was <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to Ju&s;tice, he became the Author of Happine&s;s to all that are believingly &s;ub|ject to his Government and Authority.</P>
<P>Having gone thro' the Heads of Di&s;cour&s;e propos'd; give me leave, becau&s;e of the inexpre&s;&s;ible moment of this Subject, before I proceed to the Improvement, to offer a brief An&s;wer to the prin|cipal Objections that are made again&s;t the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Socinians</HI> object, that it is a Violation of Ju&s;tice to tran&s;|fer the Puni&s;hment of one to another.</P>

But on the Contrary, when he has Power to di&s;po&s;e of his Life, con&s;ents thereto, and a valuable End can be an&s;wered thereby, it is not unju&s;t.</P>
<P>NOW every of the&s;e Things are applicable to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> He had full Power to di&s;po&s;e of his Life, and freely con&s;ented to his Death, (<HI>John</HI> x. 18.) <HI>I lay down my life, no Man taketh it from me, I have Power to lay it down and Power to take it again;</HI> nor was it po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be held under the Power of Death, (<HI>Act.</HI> ii. 24.) otherwi&s;e no doubt it would have been unrea&s;on|able for &s;uch a one as he to endure it, for worthle&s;s rebels.</P>

The Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice of all Nations agree in puni&s;hing one for anothers Fault, where there is previous Con&s;ent, as in the Ca&s;e of Ho&s;tages; tho' it is e&s;&s;ential to pu|ni&s;hment to be inflicted for Sin, yet not on the Per&s;on &s;inning, for in the Judgment of the Law, the Sinner and Surety are one.</P>
<P>EXCHANGE in Criminal Ca&s;es it is true is not allowed, but that is not from a Suppo&s;ition of Inju&s;tice in its Nature, for then it would not be allowed in civil; but for other Rea&s;ons, &s;uch as the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e Life is a Depo&s;itum committed to us, to be pre|&s;erved till God or the publick Good calls for it; be&s;ides the Pub|lick would &s;uffer lo&s;s by the De&s;truction of one of its Members, and perhaps the &s;urviving innocent, or guilty Per&s;on, grow wor&s;e by impunity.</P>
<P>Moreover we &s;hould remember, that there is a difference be|tween the &s;ame Per&s;on, when ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, and by him|&s;elf, and when &s;u&s;taining the Repre&s;entation of others, &s;ince &s;uch a one's Inocence, tho' it renders him incapable of &s;uffering&punc; &s;trictly &s;o called, in the former of the&s;e re&s;pects, yet not in the latter, becau&s;e the Law then no longer looks upon his private but publick Character; and con&s;equently the Puni&s;hment of tho&s;e he repre&s;ents devolves upon their Proxy. The&s;e Things duly con|&s;idered, the afore&s;aid grand and popular Objection vani&s;hes into Smoke.</P>
<P>But it is again objected, that the Puni&s;hment which our SAVI|OUR underwent, was not the &s;ame which the Law threatned, and therefore is not Satisfactory; it is but the Death of one, but a tran&s;ient and temporal Death, whereas the eternal Death of all was threatned.</P>
<P>I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> It is true there was a Difference in &s;ome Circum|&s;tances, but not in Sub&s;tance. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> did endure a real tem|poral Death, and &s;omething Equivalent to an eternal, in weight and value. He could not endure indeed the reproaches of a &s;inful Mind, or the Angui&s;h of De&s;pair, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible from the Nature of Things, that the&s;e Calamities could come upon an ino|cent and divine Per&s;on, they being the re&s;ult of per&s;onal Guilt and Impotency to atone for it; but our Lord endured Agonies of a|nother Kind, the awful apprehen&s;ions of a painful ignominious Death, the Malice of <HI>Satan,</HI> and the unrelenting Vengeance of Almighty God, which all united at once again&s;t him; while in the mean Time the divine Nature, as it were, withdrew from his relief. Whatever were the Ingredients of that <HI>bitter Cup</HI> which God that mix'd them, and he that drunk them, only knew, yet this we may &s;ay, that it could be no ordinary <HI>penal</HI> pre&s;&s;ure,
<PB N="23" REF="006426_0022_1028E4CFF11AADC0">
which could overwhelm his Soul with &s;uch a deluge of Grief, di&s;&s;olve his Body into a &s;weat of Blood, and at la&s;t extort this awful outcry, <HI>My God, My God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me.</HI> This inexpre&s;&s;ible weight of Pain, which the dignity of his Per&s;on put an immen&s;e Value upon, made his Sufferings equal to the Guilt of all he repre&s;ented, and more than equal to the &s;ufferings of all Mankind; the eternal angui&s;h of the whole human Race could not have &s;o much honoured the Ju&s;tice and Law of God, as the Sufferings of God him&s;elf in our Nature, tho' but for a &s;mall &s;pace of Time.</P>
<P>But to open and illu&s;trate this Matter more fully, let it be con|&s;ider'd, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Redeemer</HI> to pay the Debt of Penalty denounced by the Law for Sin, in all the Circum&s;tances of it: He did indeed endure a <HI>natural Death</HI> &s;trictly &s;o called, but then it was but one in the Room of Millions, the Defficiency of which was made up by the Dignity of his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>BUT as to <HI>&s;piritual Death,</HI> tho' he bore &s;omething like it, <HI>viz.</HI> the withdrawing for a Time a comfortable Sen&s;e of his Fa|thers love, and angui&s;h of Spirit, in a Degree that we cannot con|ceive or expre&s;s; yet it was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould endure it in all its Parts &s;trictly and properly; for as <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Life includes the&s;e two Things, <HI>viz,</HI> a Union to God by Faith and pious Ha|bits, from which all truly &s;piritual and acceptable Acts proceed, &s;o by the Law of Contraries, <HI>&s;piritual Death</HI> mu&s;t needs include a real Separation from God, a real removal or privation of pious Habits, for &s;o long as one has them, however clouded, weakned or out of Exerci&s;e, tho' he may be &s;aid to be in a &s;piritual Sleep or Con&s;umption, yet he is &s;till alive.</P>
<P>NOW to &s;uppo&s;e that the human <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was &s;eparated from the divine Nature, as it is without Foundation in Scripture, &s;o it de&s;troys the infinite value of the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of it to Ju&s;tice, which depends upon that Union.</P>
<P>AND to &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was devoid of pious Principles or Habits, is to make him a SINNER realy and inherently, and thus to di&s;qualify him entirely from being a <HI>Saviour</HI> of others. The Rea&s;on is this, the moral Law being &s;piritual, in Regard of its <HI>Author, Nature</HI> and <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> and Perfect al&s;o, mu&s;t needs re|quire Purity in the Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Soul, which cannot be without the afore&s;aid Habits: Now if CHRIST wanted the&s;e, he was di&s;conformed to the Law, and &s;o a <HI>Sinner</HI> realy and inherently, for Sin is any want of Conformity to, or Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 4. He amartia e&s;tin, he anomia.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF &s;o, CHRIST would want another MEDIATOR to &s;ave him, and therefore he was only made Sin by Imputation, being in the mean Time per&s;onally and inherently holy, harmle&s;s and undefiled, and knowing no Sin.</P>
<P>WHAT was defective in the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s human Nature,
<PB N="24" REF="006426_0023_1028E4D383312F38">
in re&s;pect of the Species or Circum&s;tances of the Penalty threatned by the Law, was made up by its Union with the divine, and &s;o rendered an equivalent to the demerit of Sin.</P>
<P>AND indeed, in this Con&s;titution, the Wi&s;dom of God appears admirably; for on the Suppo&s;ition that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> paid the Debt in Specie in all Circum&s;tances which the Law required, (were that po&s;&s;ible) the Bond would be cancelled, and all tho&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> repre|&s;ented actually freed from the Cur&s;e, at lea&s;t from the Time of the Payment made by the Surety, which Notion is as dangerous as ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>BUT an EQUIVALENT puts it into the original <HI>Creditors</HI> Power whether he will accept of it at all, and when, and how to com|municate the Benefits thereof to the Debtors.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE hereto the ble&s;&s;ed God has, in un&s;peakable Wi&s;|dom and Goodne&s;s, &s;o formed the Plan of the new Covenant, that none &s;hall have any actual Title to, or Inve&s;titure in the Be|nefits of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Purcha&s;e, until they be enabled to repent and believe.</P>
<P>THIS, rightly under&s;tood, entirely over&s;ets the dangerous and incon&s;i&s;tent Doctrines of the <HI>Antinomians,</HI> pre&s;erves the Harmony of the Scriptures, and makes the Doctrines of Grace and Duties of Religion entirely con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Objection is this, How could God receive this Sa|tisfaction, &s;ince he him&s;elf was the Party that gave it? Or how could the <HI>Saviour</HI> of Mankind, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be God, make Satisfaction to him&s;elf? The An&s;wer is,</P>
<P><Q>THAT the infinite Goodne&s;s of God in giving a Redeemer, does not dive&s;t him of the Office of &s;upreme Judge, nor hinder him from receiving a <HI>Ran&s;om</HI> to pre&s;erve the Rights of Ju&s;tice inviola|ble. To illu&s;trate this Matter, we have an eminent In&s;tance, not unlike it, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Zaleucus,</HI> the Prince of the <HI>Locrians,</HI> who pa&s;&s;ed a Law, that <HI>Adulterers</HI> &s;hould loo&s;e both their Eyes; and when his Son was convicted of that Crime, the People, who re|&s;pected him for his excellent Qualities, came and interceeded for him, <HI>Zaleucus,</HI> in a conflict between Zeal for Ju&s;tice and Affection to his Son, took but one Eye from him, and parted with one of his own to &s;atisfy the Law, and in this Action both paid and received the Puni&s;hment: He paid it as a Father, and received it as a Con&s;er|vator of publick Ju&s;tice. In like Manner when guilty Mankind could not pay the Forfeiture of the Law, God, the Father of Mercies, was plea&s;ed to give it from the Trea&s;ures of his Love, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Blood</HI> of his Son for our Ran&s;om; which he neverthe|le&s;s as the Supreme Judge received from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> upon the Cro&s;s, and declared it <HI>to be an Offering of a &s;weet &s;melling Savour to him,</HI> or a &s;ufficient Satisfaction to his Ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NOR is it incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on, that the Son of God, clothed with our Nature, &s;hould by Death make Satisfaction to the <HI>Deity,</HI> and therefore to him&s;elf. In a Difference between two Parties, a Per&s;on that belongs to one of them, may interpo&s;e for Recon|ciliation,
<PB N="25" REF="006426_0024_1028E4D95DC00B08">
provided he dive&s;ts his own Intere&s;t, and leaves it with the Party from whom he comes. For In&s;tance, when a Father and Son, both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Imperial Power, have been offended by rebellious Subjects, it may not be improper for the Son to inter|po&s;e as a <HI>Mediator,</HI> to re&s;tore them to the favour of their <HI>Prince,</HI> and yet at the &s;ame Time he reconciles them to him&s;elf, and pro|cures them the Pardon of an Offence whereby his own Maje&s;ty was violated.</Q> But the Time requires that I ha&s;ten to the Im|provement.</P>
<P>HAS <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> been &s;lain as a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Propitiation</HI> for us? Then how vain, how uncomfortable and perilous is the Opi|nion of tho&s;e who deny the <HI>Imputation</HI> of his <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to Be|lievers; for hereby they endeavour to &s;ap the Foundations of the Chri&s;tian's Hope, and &s;hut up the Springs of their Joy, hereby they oppo&s;e the continued Series of Revelation both in the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New-Te&s;tament:</HI> To <HI>deny</HI> the <HI>Imputation</HI> of his <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> to <HI>Believers,</HI> is the <HI>&s;ame Thing</HI> in <HI>effect,</HI> as to deny his being <HI>&s;acrificed</HI> for them, and equally <HI>unrea&s;onable,</HI> as has been before repre|&s;ented, and if CHRIST has not died our Faith is vain, we are without Hope, Help, Comfort; but ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, tho' the Doctrine of CHRIST crucified be to the <HI>Jews a &s;tumbling-block, and to the</HI> Greeks <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s, yet to tho&s;e that believe, it is the Wi&s;dom of GOD, and the Power of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>HAS <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> been &s;et forth as a Sacrifice of <HI>Propitiation,</HI> then we may hence learn the Sinfulne&s;s of Sin and &s;trictne&s;s of divine Ju&s;tice in the Puni&s;hment of it; its true, the Evil of <HI>Sin</HI> may be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure di&s;cerned from its malignant Nature, being an Enmity again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, a Contrariety to, and di&s;honour|able Reflexion upon all his adorable Attributes, as well as a re|bellious Contempt of all the &s;acred and unalianable Rights of his Government over the <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Moral</HI> World.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t affecting Demon&s;tration of its Malignity appears in tho&s;e Puni&s;hments which are inflicted for it; the Torments of the <HI>Damned</HI> are, no doubt, equal to the Demerit, and therefore expre&s;&s;ive of the great <HI>Evil</HI> of it: But they are too little thought upon and realiz'd by &s;tupid, indolent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, until it be too late to obtain a Deliverance; and temporal Calamities cannot &s;ufficiently repre&s;ent the infinite <HI>Di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> of GOD again&s;t the ob&s;tinate and ungrateful Contempt of his Goodne&s;s and Govern|ment; but in the Sacrifice and Sufferings of CHRIST it is expre&s;&s;ed to the utmo&s;t in the mo&s;t &s;trong and flaming Colours. Had divine Ju&s;|tice rent the Heavens and appear'd on this Theatre, attended with the mo&s;t terrible Images of Pomp and Maje&s;ty, to puni&s;h the Af|fronts and In&s;ults ca&s;t upon the Authority of GOD by impenitent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, it could not make a deeper and more abiding Im|pre&s;&s;ion upon our Minds, than the due Con&s;ideration of the Suf|ferings of our Lord JESUS: The drowning of the <HI>Old World</HI> by an awful Inundation of Water, and the dreadful De&s;truction of the Cities of the <HI>Plain</HI> by <HI>Showers of Fire,</HI> do not &s;et the
<PB N="26" REF="006426_0025_1028E4DD07B9B4F8">
Evil of <HI>Sin,</HI> and divine Severity in the Puni&s;hment of it in &s;o &s;trong and &s;triking a Light; if we con&s;ider not only the Depth of his Sufferings but the Dignity of his Per&s;on, and near Rela|tion to his eternal Father; he &s;uffered not only <HI>Torments</HI> from Men many Ways, but his <HI>Father</HI>'s <HI>Wrath</HI> in a Degree equal to the De&s;ert of all the <HI>Sins</HI> of tho&s;e he repre&s;ented; and the Per&s;on who endured the&s;e Things was the <HI>Son of GOD by Nature,</HI> and of co-equal Glory and Maje&s;ty with his eternal Father. O how in|flexible is the Ju&s;tice of GOD, that would not &s;pare even his own innocent and beloved Son, when he became <HI>Surety</HI> for Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>AND how then &s;hall tho&s;e e&s;cape the angry Strokes of GOD'S iron Rod, who ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in Unbelief and Impenitence, when &s;uch a <HI>dearly purchas'd</HI> Salvation is &s;et before them, and they repeatedly and earne&s;tly urged to accept thereof? Can they fortify them&s;elves again&s;t Almightine&s;s, or encounter with divine Vengeance, the Apprehen&s;ions of which made the Soul of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;orrowful, and heavy, <HI>even unto Death?</HI> Can they bear with Pa|tience forever, that Indignation which extorted a bloody Shower from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Body; and the mo&s;t affecting Lamentations from his Soul! <HI>Eli, Eli, lama &s;abachthani,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his per&s;onal Inocence and the Supports of his Godhead? O Sinners! For GOD'S &s;ake, realize the&s;e Things &s;peedily, lea&s;t ye feel the Weight of God's Vengeance forever.</P>
<P>AGAIN, methinks what has been &s;aid in the doctrinal Part of this Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;erves to remove the Reproach of CHRIST'S <HI>Cro&s;s;</HI> this was a <HI>Stone</HI> of <HI>Stumbling,</HI> and a <HI>Rock</HI> of <HI>Offence</HI> to the <HI>Jews,</HI> they wanted a pompous <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> to deliver them from tem|poral Bondage, and judged it ab&s;urd to expect great Things or eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s from one under Circum&s;tances of the deepe&s;t Aba&s;ement, and many of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> are of the &s;ame Stamp, and take Occa&s;ion of Prejudice one Way or other from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Cro&s;s;</HI> but to &s;uch as believe it is exceeding precious; for they clearly apprehend that CHRIST by his Death has &s;atisfied Ju&s;tice, made Attonement for <HI>Sin,</HI> and purcha&s;ed &s;piritual and eternal Benefits: The Doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Sacrifice upon the Cro&s;s, is the very <HI>Foundation</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> upon which its whole Fabrick is firmly built; its the <HI>Center</HI> in which the <HI>Lines</HI> of both <HI>Te&s;ta|ments</HI> meet and harmonize, the <HI>Soul</HI> that animates the whole Frame, without which it is but a dead Carca&s;e; this is the Source of our Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace, our Comfort and Salvation: This opens a Door of <HI>Hope</HI> to di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Sinners, and a Fountain of <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Solace,</HI> to all the Saints of GOD that will never, ne|ver run dry. For the Man <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> is to them <HI>a hiding-place from the Wind, a Covert from the Tempe&s;t, as Rivers of Waters in a dry Place, and as the Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land,</HI> &s;ure Protection from every Danger, &s;weet Refre&s;hment in every Difficulty, and &s;trong Support under every Pre&s;&s;ure; a Balm to every Wound, a Salvo to every Fear, yea, even to that

of divine Ju&s;tice; for Ju&s;tice being &s;atisfied by the Blood of the great Sacrifice becomes our Friend, and in&s;tead of barring us out of the cele&s;tial Paradi&s;e with its <HI>flaming Sword,</HI> &s;afely conducts us thither, and infallibly a&s;certains our <HI>Salvation;</HI> for JUSTICE in its Nature requires but a &s;ingle PAYMENT, which GOD the Father having received, in the obedient <HI>Sufferings</HI> of his be|loved <HI>Son;</HI> is JUST, even IN JUSTIFYING THOSE THAT BE|LIEVE IN HIM.</P>
<P>O therefore let us come to CHRIST, and depend upon his BLOOD alone for Ju&s;tification and Salvation; <HI>for him hath GOD &s;et forth to be a Propitiation thro' Faith in his</HI> Blood; it is in vain, my Brethren, to depend upon our <HI>Works,</HI> for he is <HI>cur&s;ed that don't continue in all Things that are written in the Book of the Law, to do them,</HI> and if we were perfect in our Obedience in Time coming, this Payment which is due to the <HI>Law,</HI> cannot can|cel the former Debt we are under to Ju&s;tice for pa&s;t Offences; it is in vain to come with Burnt-Offerings, and Calves of a Year old, to offer thou&s;ands of Rams, and ten thou&s;and Rivers of Oil, or to offer our <HI>Fir&s;t-born</HI> for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the Fruit of our Body for the Sins of our Souls, it is <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone, that can help and &s;ave us: O then let us with the Apo&s;tle count all Things but Lo&s;s and Dung for the Excellency of the Know|lege of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord, that we may be found in him, not ha|ving our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law, but that which is thro' the Faith of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD thro' Faith; let us beware of the Ignorance of God's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, lea&s;t we go about to e&s;tabli&s;h our own, and &s;o rebelliou&s;ly refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD, &s;eeing that by the Deeds of the <HI>Law in Fle&s;h living can be ju&s;tified,</HI> let us then inviolably pur|&s;ue the Apo&s;tle's Sentiments, Di&s;po&s;ition, and Practice, maugre all Oppo&s;ition to the Contrary from Men and from <HI>Devils,</HI> namely, <HI>to de&s;ire to know nothing but</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>and him crucified, to wor&s;hip</HI> God <HI>in the Spirit, to have no Confidence in the Fle&s;h, and to rejoice in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who by the Sacrifice of him&s;elf has &s;atisfied divine Ju&s;tice for us, and is our <HI>all in all,</HI> AMEN, AMEN, AMEN.
