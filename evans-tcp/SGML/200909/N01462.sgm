</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the beginning of this <HI>Chapter</HI> we have the Account of the <HI>Brotherly</HI> Affectionate Meeting of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>E&s;au.</HI> It was a &s;in|gular Proof of Gods <HI>Empire</HI> over the hearts of Men, and of His gracious <HI>Care</HI> of good Men and anfwering their Prayers. <HI>Jacob</HI> had been <HI>Wre&s;tling</HI> in Prayer for this favour of Providence. His fears of his <HI>Brothers</HI> re&s;ent|ments had been very Great. In his great Pru|dence and Wi&s;dom he had taken the mo&s;t like|ly mea&s;ures to <HI>Soften</HI> his Brothers heart towards him. He &s;ent his <HI>Pre&s;ents</HI> before him, and now put his <HI>Wives</HI> and their <HI>Children</HI> into the mo&s;t Moving Order that could be, and him&s;elf as the
<PB N="2" REF="001737_0005_0FB776CA75B6F230">head of them. <HI>Seven times</HI> he bowed him&s;elf to the Ground before his <HI>Brother;</HI> He did O|bey&s;ance to him as his <HI>Elder</HI> Brother, and his Temporal <HI>Lord;</HI> He remembred al&s;o its very likely the <HI>Injury and Provocation</HI> he had on his part given tho' the thing was of God. This <HI>Humility</HI> and Re&s;pect of <HI>Jacob</HI> turn'd <HI>E&s;au</HI>'s heart within him, or rather <HI>GOD chang'd</HI> it in that In&s;tant; and <HI>E&s;an ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his Neck and ki&s;&s;ed him, and they both wept.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Natural Affection</HI> which had been &s;o long <HI>Suppre&s;s'd,</HI> now returned in the <HI>Full Tyde</HI> thereof. How <HI>good is it</HI> to &s;ee <HI>Brethren</HI> that have been at Enmity &s;o reconciled! <HI>A Brother offended is hard to be won.</HI> He that offends is hardly bro't to &s;ubmit like <HI>Jacob.</HI> When God touches a Mans heart his Enmity to his Brother vani&s;hes. When &s;hall we &s;ee Brethren at di&s;tance meet again like the&s;e in our <HI>Context,</HI> and Emulate &mdash; I will not &s;ay the temper of Profane <HI>E&s;au,</HI> &mdash; that would be a reproach &mdash; but the humility and affection of good <HI>Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>THEY meet and &s;ay not a Word of their old differences: <HI>that</HI> would have &s;oon broke the Peace again; had <HI>E&s;au</HI> remembred how <HI>Jacob</HI> had <HI>Supplanted</HI> him with a Lye, or <HI>Jacob</HI> re|peated <HI>E&s;au</HI>'s threaning to <HI>Murder</HI> him. <Q>'Tis the <HI>Repeating</HI> a Matter that Separates Friends, and Perpetuates their Separation. A &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Carriage will go a great way to conquer a very <HI>E&s;au</HI> and turn away Wrath. The Bullet flies over him that &s;toops:</Q> Sayes Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></P>

<HI>I'M afraid,</HI> tho' Charity obliges us to think the be&s;t; yet I'm <HI>afraid</HI> that <HI>E&s;an</HI>'s <HI>carnal tho'ts</HI> of the Birthright and of the Ble&s;&s;ing helpt to pre&s;erve <HI>Jacob.</HI> He was born the <HI>Prince</HI> of the Family, and &s;aw now <HI>that Birthright</HI> &s;ecure; <HI>Jacob</HI> with his Children lying at his Feet. This might help to make him <HI>Ea&s;ie.</HI> His <HI>Arming</HI> and Conte&s;t might be for a <HI>Temporal Dominion;</HI> that's the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> that mo&s;t People de&s;ire.

<P>BUT the thing was of <HI>God,</HI> who turns Mens Hearts by a Secret, Silent, Re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Power, as He plea&s;es.

<P N="3">[III.] Under the Outward Smiles of Provi|dence on us and our Families, it well becomes us to be the more Humble, Meek and Lowly before God and Man. They are the Family which God has <HI>Graciou&s;ly</HI> given <HI>thy Servant.</HI></P>

<P>YET Children are by no Means to be put a|mong or equal'd to the <HI>Saving Gifts</HI> of Gods Grace. There is a better Name than of Sons and Dau'ters. A Numerous Po&s;terity is the Portion of many a <HI>Wicked Per&s;on.</HI> P&s;al. 17.14, 15. <HI>They are full of Children, and leave their Sub&s;tance to their Babes; as for me I will behold thy face in Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. Neverthele&s;s Children are a very Gracious <HI>Gift</HI> of God to us in this Life. They are &s;o,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IN the Formation of them in the Womb.</HI> For who knoweth the way of the Spirit, or how the bones do grow within Her that is with Child?

But could Pious <HI>Hannah or Ruth</HI> receive their Sons without their Solemn Offerings of Prai&s;es to God? No: Ruth 4.14. <HI>And the Women &s;aid unto Naomi, Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord which has not left thee this day without a Name in I&s;rael: and Naomi took the Child and laid it in her Bo&s;om.</HI> Read al&s;o <HI>Hannah:</HI> tran&s;port of Devotion at the Dedication of her <HI>Little Nazarite,</HI> and Her <HI>Song:</HI> 1 Sam. 2. Chap.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF Children are Gods Gift to us, <HI>Then they &s;hould be given to God again:</HI> Dedicated to Him as His Propriety and Re&s;igned to His di&s;po&s;al; to be bro't up for Him, and to Live to Him and Serve Him for ever. So <HI>Abraham</HI> Circumcis'd his <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Hannah</HI> devoted her <HI>Samuel,</HI> and we in <HI>Bapti&s;m Con&s;ecrate our Children unto CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>CHILDREN &s;hould remember them&s;elves to be the LORD's, and their Bonds to Live to Him.</HI> God gave thee thy Being and thy Life; and gave thee to thy Parents who have given thee back to Him again. Be <HI>His,</HI> My <HI>Child;</HI> and &s;o Gods gracious Gift to <HI>Us,</HI> and <HI>Ours</HI> and thine <HI>Own</HI> to Him again.</P>
<P N="5">5. IF Children are the gracious Gift of God, then it is <HI>Lawful and a Duty to Mourn under the Holy and Awful hand of God in their Death; or in their Sinful Cour&s;es</HI> which may be wor&s;e than Death. Sorrow is Natural, and may be Gracious in &s;uch Ca&s;es; but it mu&s;t be in Moderation
<PB N="15" REF="001737_0016_0FB7770B671347D8">and with Re&s;ignation. Even <HI>Jacob</HI> him&s;elf was an Intemperate Mourner for <HI>Jo&s;eph;</HI> and bitter was his Grief and deep his Shame when &s;ome others of his <HI>Sons</HI> &s;tain'd their hands with blood, &s;hed treacherou&s;ly and cuelly. Our <HI>Dead</HI> Sor|rows are often very heavy ones; like the &s;hrieks at <HI>Rama, Rachel</HI> Mourning for her Children, not to be Comforted. But our <HI>Living</HI> Sorrows may be <HI>heavier</HI> far, as well as more <HI>La&s;ting:</HI> Prov. 10.1. <HI>A wi&s;e Son maketh a glad Father, but a fooli&s;h Son is the heavine&s;s of his Mother.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the <HI>Fir&s;t Thing</HI> under the <HI>Second Ob|&s;ervation;</HI> That Children are among the Special Favours and Gifts of Providence.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>WE ought to have a high Sen&s;e of the Grace of God expre&s;&s;ed towards us in the hopeful Children which He gives us.</HI> They are <HI>Graciou&s;ly</HI> given to us. The Gift of free Grace; without and again&s;t our de&s;erts.</P>
<P>THEY are a Vi&s;ible and Sen&s;ible Expre&s;&s;ion of the Divine Favour to us. So we read, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26.5. That <HI>Obed-Edom had Eight Sons, for God ble&s;&s;ed him.</HI> Many Children are the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing on a Family.</P>
<P>THEY are a great <HI>Plea&s;ure and Delight</HI> to Parents: an <HI>Honour and Reputation</HI> al&s;o among Men; and a Safe-guard and <HI>Protection</HI> to us as they grow up. P&s;al. 127.4, 5. <HI>As arrows are in the hand of a mighty Man, &s;o are Children of the Youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver
<PB N="16" REF="001737_0017_0FB7770CAA108E00">full of them: &mdash; they &s;hall &s;peak with the Enemies in the gate.</HI> Good Children are &s;o many faithful <HI>"Zealous Seconds</HI> to their Parents, in the vigour of their Youth to &s;tand up in Their defence, when They are Injuriou&s;ly run down in Age. <HI>"As arrows in the hand of a Mi'ty man,</HI> who knows how to u&s;e them for his own &s;afety, <HI>And as a giver full of them;</HI> &s;o is his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> &s;uppli'd, and under the favour of Providence <HI>abides in strength.</HI></P>
<P>CHILDREN are more than <HI>Riches:</HI> they are the <HI>Heirs</HI> of it: and which is, Greater, the Earth or its <HI>Owners?</HI> Moreover, we may and ought to hope well concerning our Children with re&s;pect to the <HI>Spiritual and Everla&s;ting Ble&s;|&s;ings of the Life to come.</HI> As <HI>Jacob</HI> here look'd upon <HI>his Children</HI> as Graciou&s;ly given him be|cau&s;e they were <HI>Heirs of the Covenant Ble&s;&s;ing;</HI> they were to build up the Church of God, and be the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> the Fathers of the People of God. He <HI>Hop'd</HI> too that they were or would be Gracious, that they did belong to the <HI>Election of Grace;</HI> and &s;o were Heirs of Everla&s;ting Life.</P>
<P>IN a Word; the <HI>least Token</HI> of Gods favour is <HI>free Grace</HI> to a Sinful Creature. Our <HI>Sins</HI> daily forfeit our be&s;t Mercies, and might for ever keep good things from us. It is of Gods Free, and Rich, and Sovereign Grace that He does not <HI>call our Sins to Remembrance</HI> &s;o as to <HI>Slay our "Children.</HI> When God <HI>Removes</HI> our Comforts He <HI>Remembers</HI> our Sins; while He continues them to us He graciou&s;ly <HI>Overlooks</HI> our Sinfulne&s;s: <HI>i. e.</HI> This is the Face and Language of His Providence:</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="001737_0018_0FB77719BB110C48">
TO <HI>Improve this Head</HI> a little.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>PARENTS take Plea&s;ure in your Children, be very Tender of them, and look on 'em alwayes with Complacency and E&s;teem.</HI> A very needle&s;s <HI>Exhor|tation</HI> you may be ready to think; for alas Parents are ready to be but <HI>too fond</HI> of their Offspring.

<P>Yet,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>BEWARE of Inordinate Love.</HI> Do not give them thy heart. Make 'em not <HI>Idols.</HI> And don't Love 'em to death; by provoking God to <HI>Jea|lou&s;y</HI> by giving that Love to any Creature which is due to Him alone. Love them in <HI>O|bedience</HI> to God, and as <HI>His</HI> more than thine. Mat. 10.37. <HI>He that loveth Son or Dau'ter more than Me is not worthy of Me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. CARRY and <HI>behave thy &s;elf graciou&s;ly</HI> under this favour of Providence; if God has filled, or is filling thy Hou&s;e with Children.</P>
<P>AND therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>BE the more Devoted to God thy Self, every Child He gives thee.</HI> Renew then the Con&s;ecration of thy Self, and thy Covenant Engagements to the Lord: it is a very <HI>Proper &s;ea&s;on to do it Solemnly.</HI></P>

2. <HI>INSTRUCT and Educate well</HI> the Children that God gives thee. Bring them up for Him; in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord; this is the <HI>Grateful Offering</HI> which He requires.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>PRAY much for them, and Over them, and Charge them</HI> to Know the God of their Fathers, &amp; to Serve Him with a Perfect Heart and Willing Mind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Pray with <HI>Abraham, O that I&s;hmael may live in thy Sight!</HI> Ble&s;s them as <HI>I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did.

<P N="4">4. <HI>BE not Proud or Elated on this Account be|fore Men;</HI> if God ble&s;&s;es thee with Children and builds up thy Family.

<HEAD>III. Ob&s;er. <HI>THAT under the Outward Smiles of Providence on us and our Families, it well becomes us to be the more Humble, Meek and Lowly before God and Man.</HI></HEAD>

<P><HI>BE ye clothed with Humility:</HI> &s;ayes the <HI>Apostle,</HI> 1 Pet. 5.5. This is our <HI>glorious but decent</HI> Ar|ray whether we be in Pro&s;perity or Adver&s;ity-Without it the <HI>Nakedne&s;s</HI> of the Soul is di&s;|covered, and its <HI>Shame</HI> is &s;een.</P>
