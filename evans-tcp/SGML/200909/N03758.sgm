<P>I Thought it proper to dedicate to you the following Sermon, which I delivered among you, as a Te&s;ti|mony of my Regard for you; and de&s;ire that you might be directed in the Choice of a Mini&s;ter, that &s;o that important Affair might be managed to your &s;piritual and immortal Benefit.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould object again&s;t the Stile, and &s;ay, That it is too pointed; I an&s;wer, That it is not keener than the Reflections of Chri&s;t him&s;elf again&s;t the old Phari|&s;ees. So far as I know my Heart, it is Grief for the Injuries that have been done to the Church of God by natural Mini&s;ters, that has extorted &s;uch Acrimony from my Pen.</P>
<P>If there be any Rule of any Church, that &s;eems to contradict what is offered in the following Di&s;cour&s;e, it ought to be con&s;idered, that there is a great Differ|ence between the <HI>flouri&s;hing</HI> and <HI>declining</HI> State of the Church, and that <HI>Every general Rule admits of Exceptions.</HI></P>
<P>May the LORD &s;courge Hirelings out of his Temple, and &s;upply you with a faithful Mini&s;ter, according to His own Heart, that may feed you with Knowledge and Under&s;tanding. I remain</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>MARK VI. 34.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And Je&s;us, when he came out, &s;aw much People, and was moved with Compa&s;&s;ion towards them, becau&s;e they were as Sheep not having a Shep|herd.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AS a faithful Mini&s;try is a great Ornament, Ble&s;&s;ing, and Comfort, to the Church of GOD; even the Feet of &s;uch Me&s;&s;engers are beautiful: So on the contrary, an ungodly Mini&s;try is a great Cur&s;e and Judgment: The&s;e Caterpillars labour to devour every green Thing.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing that may more ju&s;tly call forth our &s;adde&s;t Sorrows, and make all our Powers and Pa&s;&s;ions mourn, in the mo&s;t doleful Accents, the mo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant, in&s;atiable, and deploring Agonies; than the melancholy Ca&s;e of &s;uch, who have no faithful Mini&s;try! This Truth is &s;et before our Minds in a &s;trong Light, in the Words that I have cho&s;en now to in&s;i&s;t upon; in which we have an Account of our LORD's Grief with the Cau&s;es of it.</P>
<P>WE are informed, That our dear Redeemer was moved with Compa&s;&s;ion towards them. The Ori|ginal Word &s;ignifies the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t vehement Pity, i&s;&s;uing from the innermo&s;t Bowels.</P>
<P>BUT what was the Cau&s;e of this great and com|pa&s;&s;ionate Commotion in the Heart of Chri&s;t? It was becau&s;e he &s;aw much People as Sheep having no Shepherd. Why, had the People then no Teachers? O yes! they had Heaps of Phari&s;ee-Teachers, that
<PB N="4" REF="004610_0004_100DAB8C2A2FB690">came out, no doubt after they had been at the Feet of <HI>Gamaliel</HI> the u&s;ual Time, and according to the Acts, Canons, and Traditions of the Jewi&s;h Church. But notwith&s;tanding of the great Crowds of the&s;e Or|thodox, Letter-learned and regular Phari&s;ees, our Lord laments the unhappy Ca&s;e of that great Number of People, who, in the Days of his Fle&s;h, had no better Guides: Becau&s;e that tho&s;e were as good as none (in many Re&s;pects) in our Saviour's Judgment. For all them, the People were as Sheep without a Shepherd.</P>
<P>FROM the Words of our Text, the following Propo&s;ition offers it&s;elf to our Con&s;ideration, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the Ca&s;e of &s;uch is much to be pitied, who have no other but Phari&s;ee-Shepherds, or unconverted Teachers.</HI></P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing upon this Subject, I would
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>Enquire into the Characters of the Old Phari&s;ee-Teachers.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>Shew, why the Ca&s;e of &s;uch People, who have no better, &s;hould be pitied. And</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>Shew, how Pity &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed upon this mournful Occa&s;ion!</HI></ITEM>
</LIST> And</P>
<P>FIRST I am to enquire into the <HI>Characters of the Old Phari&s;ee-Teachers.</HI> Now, I think the mo&s;t notorious Branches of their Character, were the&s;e, viz. <HI>Pride, Policy, Malice, Ignorance, Covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Bigotry to human Inventions in religious Matters.</HI></P>
<P>THE old Phari&s;ees were very proud and conceity; the loved the uppermo&s;t Seats in the Synagogues, and to be called Rabbi, Rabbi; they were ma&s;terly and po&s;itive in their A&s;&s;ertions, as if for&s;ooth Know|ledge mu&s;t die with them; they look'd upon others that differed from them, and the common People, with an Air of Di&s;dian; and e&s;pecially any who had a Re&s;pect for JESUS and his Doctrine, and di&s;lik'd them; they judged &s;uch accur&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004610_0005_100DAB8DBA686098">
THE old Phari&s;ee-Shepherds were as crafty as Foxes; they tried by all Means to en&s;nare our Lord by their captious Que&s;tions, and to expo&s;e him to the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the State; while in the mean Time, by &s;ly and &s;neaking Methods, they tried to &s;ecure for them&s;elves the Favour of the Grandees, and the People's Applau&s;e; and this they obtained to their Satisfaction. <HI>Joh.</HI> 7.48.</P>
<P>BUT while they exerted the Craft of Foxes, they did not forget to breath forth the Cruelty of Wolves, in a malicious A&s;per&s;ing the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, and in a violent Oppo&s;ing of the Truths, People, and Power of his Religion. Yea, the mo&s;t &s;tern and &s;trict of them were the Ring-leaders of the Party: Witne&s;s <HI>Saul</HI>'s Journey to <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> with Letters from the Chief Prie&s;t, to bring bound to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> all that he could find of that Way. It's true the Phari&s;ees did not proceed to violent Mea&s;ures with our Saviour and his Di&s;ciples ju&s;t at fir&s;t; but that was not owing to their good Nature, but their Po|licy; for they feared the People. They mu&s;t keep the People in their Intere&s;ts: Ay, that was the main Chance, the Compa&s;s that directed all their Proceed|ings; and therefore &s;uch &s;ly cautious Methods mu&s;t be pur&s;ued as might con&s;i&s;t herewith. They wanted to root vital Religion out of the World; but they found it beyond their Thumb.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH &s;ome of the old Phari&s;ee-Shepherds had a very fair and &s;trict Out-&s;ide; yet were they ignorant of the New Birth: Witne&s;s Rabbi <HI>Nicode|mus,</HI> who talk'd like a Fool about it. Hear how our LORD cur&s;ed tho&s;e plai&s;ter'd Hypocrites, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.27, 28. <HI>Wo unto you, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, Hy|pocrites; for ye are like whited Sepulchres, which in|deed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead Bones, and of all Uncleanne&s;s. Even &s;o ye al&s;o appear righteous unto Men, but within ye are full of
<PB N="6" REF="004610_0006_100DAB8F6521D430">Hypocri&s;ie and Iniquity.</HI> Ay, if they had but a little of the Learning then in Fa&s;hion, and a fair Out|&s;ide, they were pre&s;ently put into the Prie&s;t's Office, though they had no Experience of the New Birth. O &s;ad!</P>
<P>THE old Phari&s;ees, for all their long Prayers and other pious Pretences, had their Eyes, with <HI>Judas,</HI> fixed upon the Bag. Why, they came into the Prie&s;ts Office for a Piece of Bread; they took it up as a Trade, and therefore endeavoured to make the be&s;t Market of it they could. O Shame!</P>
<P>IT may be further ob&s;erved, That the Phari&s;ee-Teachers in Chri&s;t's Time, were great Bigots to &s;mall Matters in Religion. <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.23. <HI>Wo unto you, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, Hypocrites; for ye pay Tyth of Mint, and Ani&s;e, and Cumin, and have omitted the weightier Matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith.</HI> The Phari&s;ees were fired with a Party-Zeal; they compa&s;&s;ed Sea and Land to make a Pro&s;elyte; and yet when he was made, they made him twofold more the Child of Hell than them&s;elves. They were al&s;o bigotted to human Inventions in religious Matters: <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf, while he was a natural Man, was wonderful zealous for the Tradi|tions of the Fathers: Ay, tho&s;e poor blind Guides, as our LORD te&s;tifies, &s;trained at a Gnat, and &s;wallowed a Camel.</P>
<P>AND what a mighty Re&s;pect had they for the Sabbath-Day for&s;ooth! in &s;o much that Chri&s;t and his Di&s;ciples mu&s;t be charged with the Breach there|of, for doing Works of Mercy and Nece&s;&s;ity. Ah the Rottenne&s;s of the&s;e Hypocrites! It was not &s;o much Re&s;pect to the Sabbath, as Malice again&s;t Chri&s;t, that was the Occa&s;ion of the Charge; they wanted &s;ome plau&s;ible Pretence to offer again&s;t him, in order to blacken his Character.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004610_0007_100DAB9152C436E8">
AND what a great Love had they in Pretence to tho&s;e pious Prophets, who were dead before they were born? while in the mean Time they were per&s;ecuting the Prince of Prophets! Hear how the King of the Church &s;peaks to them, upon this Head: <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.29&mdash;33. <HI>Wo unto you, Scribes and Pha|ri&s;ees, Hypocrites; becau&s;e ye build the Tombs of the Prophets, and garni&s;h the Sepulchres of the Righteous; and &s;ay, If we had been in the Days of our Fathers, we would not have been Partakers with them in the Blood of the Prophets. Ye Serpents, ye Generation of Vipers, how can ye e&s;cape the Damnation of Hell?</HI> The</P>
<P>SECOND GENERAL HEAD of Di&s;cour&s;e, is to &s;hew, <HI>Why &s;uch People, who have no better than the Old Phari&s;ee-Teachers, are to be pitied?</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1. Natural Men have no Call of GOD to the Mini&s;terial Work, under the Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;ation. Isn't it a principal Part of the ordinary Call of GOD to the Mini&s;terial Work, to aim at the Glory of GOD, and, in Subordination thereto, the Good of Souls, as their chief Marks in their Undertaking that Work? And can any natural Man on Earth do this? No! no! Every Skin of them has an evil Eye; for no Cau&s;e can produce Effects above its own Power. Are not wicked Men forbid to meddle in Things &s;acred? <HI>P&s;.</HI> 50.16. <HI>But unto the Wicked, GOD &s;aith, What ha&s;t thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou &s;hould&s;t take my Covenant in thy Mouth?</HI> Now, are not all unconverted Men wicked Men? does not the Lord JESUS inform us, <HI>John</HI> 10.1. That <HI>he who entreth not by the Door into the Sheep-&s;old, but climbeth up &s;ome other Way, the &s;ame is a Thief and a Robber?</HI> In the <HI>9th v.</HI> Chri&s;t tells us, That <HI>He is the Door;</HI> and that <HI>if any Man enter in by him, he &s;hall be &s;aved, by him,</HI> i. e. By Faith in him, (&s;ays <HI>Henry.</HI>) Hence we read of a
<PB N="8" REF="004610_0008_100DAB9390119A08"><HI>Doer of Faith,</HI> being opened to the Gentiles <HI>Acts</HI> 24. 27. It confirms this Glo&s;s, that Salvation is anrexed to the Entrance before-mentionen. Remarkable is that Saying of our Saviour, <HI>Matth.</HI> 4.19. <HI>Follow me, and I will make you Fi&s;hers of Men.</HI> See, our LORD will not make Men Mini&s;ters, 'til they follow him. Men that do not follow Chri&s;t, may fi&s;h faithfully for a good Name, and for worldly Pelf; but not for the Conver&s;ion of Sinners to God. Is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that they will be earne&s;tly concerned for others Salvation, when they &s;light their own? Our LORD reprov'd <HI>Nicodemus</HI> for taking upon him the Office of in&s;tructing others, while he him&s;elf was a Stranger to the New Birth, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.10. <HI>Art thou a Ma&s;ter of I&s;rael, and knowe&s;t not the&s;e Things?</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> (in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.12.) thanks GOD for counting him faithful, and putting him into the Mini&s;try; which plainly &s;uppo&s;es, That GOD Al|mighty does not &s;end Phari&s;ees and natural Men into the Mini&s;try: For how can the&s;e Men be faithful, that have no Faith? It's true Men may put them into the Mini&s;try, through Unfaithfulne&s;s, or Mi&s;|take; or Credit and Money may draw them, and the Devil may drive them into it, knowing by long Experience, of what &s;pecial Service they may be to his Kingdom in that Office: But GOD &s;ends not &s;uch hypocritical Varlets. Hence <HI>Timothy</HI> was di|rected by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> to commit the mini&s;terial Work to faithful Men. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.2. And do not the&s;e Quali&s;ications, nece&s;&s;ary for Church-Officers, &s;pecified 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.7.8, 9, 11. &amp; <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.7, 8. plainly &s;uppo&s;e converting Grace? How el&s;e can they avoid being greedy of filthy Lucre? How el&s;e can they hold the My&s;tery of Faith in a pure Con&s;cience, and be faithful in all Things? How el&s;e can they be Lovers of Good, &s;ober, ju&s;t, holy, temperate?</P>
<P N="2">2. The Mini&s;try of natural Men is uncomfortable to gracious Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004610_0009_100DAB97700D8F38">
The Enmity that is put between the Seed of the Woman and the Seed of the Serpent, will now and then be creating Jarrs: And no wonder; for as it was of old, &s;o it is now, <HI>He that was born after the Fle&s;h, per&s;ecuted him that was born after the Spirit.</HI> This Enmity is not one Grain le&s;s, in unconverted Mini&s;ters, that in others; tho' po&s;&s;ibly it may be better poli&s;hed with Wit and Rhetorick, and gilded with the &s;pecious Names of Zeal, Fidelity, Peace, good Order, and Unity.</P>
<P>Natural Men, not having true Love to Chri&s;t and the Souls of their Fellow-Creatures, hence their Di&s;cour&s;es are cold and &s;aple&s;s, and as it were freeze between their Lips. And not being &s;ent of GOD, they want that divine Authority, with which the faithful Amba&s;&s;adors of CHRIST are clothed, who herein re&s;emble their ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, of whom it is &s;aid, That <HI>He taught as one having Authority, and not as the Scribes.</HI> Matth. 7.29.</P>
<P>And Phari&s;ee-Teachers, having no Experience of a &s;pecial Work of the Holy Gho&s;t, upon their own Souls, are therefore neither inclined to, nor fitted for Di&s;cour&s;ing, frequently, clearly, and pathetically, upon &s;uch important Subjects. The Application of their Di&s;cour&s;es, is either &s;hort, or indi&s;tinct and general. They difference not the precious from the vile, and divide not to every Man his Portion, ac|cording to the Apo&s;tolical Direction to <HI>Timethy.</HI> No! they carele&s;sly offer a common Me&s;s to their People, and leave it to them, to divide it among them&s;elves, as they &s;ee fit. This is indeed their ge|neral Practice, which is bad enough: But &s;ometimes they do wor&s;e, by mi&s;applying the Word, through Ignorance, or Anger. They often &s;trengthen the Hands of the Wicked, by promi&s;ing him Life. They comfort People, before they convince them; &s;ow before they plow, and are bu&s;y in rai&s;ing a
<PB N="10" REF="004610_0010_100DAB995EFEFB78">Fabrick, before they lay a Foundation. The&s;e fooli&s;h Builders do but &s;trengthen Men's carnal Se|curity, by their &s;oft, &s;elfi&s;h, cowardly Di&s;cour&s;es. They have not the Courage, or Hone&s;ty, to thru&s;t the Nail of Terror into &s;leeping Souls; nay, &s;ome|times they &s;trive with all their Might, to fa&s;ten Ter|ror into the Hearts of the Righteous, and &s;o to make tho&s;e &s;ad, whom GOD would not have made &s;ad! And this happens, when pious People begin to &s;u&s;pect their Hypocri&s;ie, for which they have good Rea&s;on. I may add, That ina&s;much as Phari&s;ee-Teachers &s;eek after Righteou&s;ne&s;s as it were by the Works of the Law them&s;elves, they therefore do not di&s;tin|gui&s;h, as they ought, between <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> in their Di&s;cour&s;es to others. They keep Driving, Driving, to Duty, Duty, under this Notion, That it will recommend natural Men to the Favour of GOD, or entitle them to the Promi&s;es of Grace and Salvation: and thus tho&s;e blind Guides &s;ix a de|luded World upon the fal&s;e Foundation of their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and &s;o exclude them from the dear Redeemer. All the Doings of unconverted Men, not proceeding from the Principles of Faith, Love, and a new Nature, nor being directed to the divine Glory as their highe&s;t End, but flowing from, and tending to Self, as their Principle and End; are doubtle&s;s damnably wicked in their Manner of Per|formance, and do de&s;erve the Wrath and Cur&s;e of a Sin-avenging GOD; neither can any other En|couragement be ju&s;tly given them, but this, That in the Way of Duty, there is a Peradventure or Probability of obtaining Mercy.</P>
<P>And natural Men, wanting the Experience of tho&s;e &s;piritual Difficulties, which pious Souls are ex|po&s;ed to, in this Vale of Tears; they know not how to &s;peak a Word to the Weary in Sea&s;on. Their Prayers are al&s;o cold; little child-like Love to God
<PB N="11" REF="004610_0011_100DAB9BA49ABA40">or Pity to poor peri&s;hing Souls, runs thro' their Veins. Their Conver&s;ation hath nothing of the Savour of Chri&s;t, neither is it perfum'd with the Spices of Hea|ven. They &s;eem to make as little Di&s;tinction in their Practice as Preaching. They love tho&s;e Unbelievers that are kind to them, better than many Chri&s;tians, and chu&s;e them for Companions; contrary to <HI>P&s;.</HI> 15. 4. <HI>P&s;.</HI> 119.115., <HI>&amp; Gal.</HI> 6.10. Poor Chri&s;tians are &s;tunted and &s;tarv'd, who are put to &s;eed on &s;uch bare Pa&s;tures, and &s;uch dry Nur&s;es; as the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hilder&s;ham</HI> ju&s;tly calls them. It's only when the wi&s;e Virgins &s;leep, that they can bear with tho&s;e dead Dogs, that can't bark; but when the LORD revives his People, they can't but abhor them. O! it is ready to break their very Hearts with Grief, to &s;ee how luke-warm tho&s;e Phari&s;ee-Teachers are in their pub|lick Di&s;cour&s;es, while Sinners are &s;inking into Dam|nation, in Multitudes! But</P>
<P N="3">3. The Mini&s;try of natural Men, is for the mo&s;t part unpro&s;itable; which is confirmed by a threefold Evidence, <HI>viz.</HI> of Scripture, Rea&s;on, and Experience, Such as the LORD &s;ends not he him&s;elf a&s;&s;ures us, &s;hall not pro&s;it the People at all. <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.32. Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> ju&s;tly glo&s;&s;eth upon this Pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred Scrip|ture, thus, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That none can expect GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing upon their Mini&s;try, that are not called and &s;ent of GOD into the Mini&s;try.</Q> And right Rea&s;on will inform us, how unfit In&s;truments they are to negotiate that Work they pretend to. Is a blind Man &s;it to be a Guide in a very dangerous Way? Is a dead Man &s;it to bring others to Life? a mad Man &s;it to give Coun&s;el in a Matter of Life and Death? Is a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Man &s;it to ca&s;t out Devils? a Rebel, an Enerny to GOD, &s;it to be &s;ent on an Emba&s;&s;y of Peace, to bring Rebels into a State of Friend&s;hip with GOD? a Captive bound in the Ma&s;&s;y Chains of Darkne&s;s and Guilt, a proper
<PB N="12" REF="004610_0012_100DAB9FE6FBD3F0">Per&s;on to &s;et others at Liberty? a Leper, or one that has Plague-fores upon him, &s;it to be a good Phy&s;ician? Is an ignorant Ru&s;tick, that has never been at Sea in his Life, &s;it to be a Pilot, to keep Ve&s;&s;els from being da&s;hed to Pieces upon Rocks and Sand-banks? <Q>Isn't an unconverted Mini&s;ter like a Man who would learn others to &s;wim, before he has learn'd it him&s;elf, and &s;o is drowned in the Act, and dies like a Fool?</Q></P>
<P>I may add, That &s;ad Experience verifies what has been now ob&s;erved, concerning the Unpro&s;itablene&s;s of the Mini&s;try of unconverted Men. Look into the Congregations of unconverted Mini&s;ters, and &s;ee what a &s;ad Security reigns there; not a Soul con|vinced that can be heard of, for many Years to|gether: and yet the Mini&s;ters are ea&s;y; for they &s;ay they do their Duty! Ay, a &s;mall Matter will &s;atisfy us in the Want of that, which we have no great De&s;ire after. But when Per&s;ons have their Eyes opened, and their Hearts &s;et upon the Work of God; they are not &s;o &s;oon &s;atisfied with their Doings, and with Want of Succe&s;s for a Time. O! they mourn with <HI>Micah,</HI> that they are as tho&s;e that gather the Summer-Fruits, as the Grape-gleaning of the Vint|age. &mdash; Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <Q>That tho&s;e who &s;peak about their Doings in the afore&s;aid Manner, are like to do little Good to the Church of God?</Q> <Q>But many Mini&s;ters (as Mr. <HI>Bracel</HI> ob&s;erves) think the Go&s;pel flouri&s;hes among them when the People are in Peace, and many come to hear the Word, and to the Sacrament.</Q> If with the other they get their Salaries well paid; O then it is fine Times indeed! in their Opinion. O &s;ad! And they are full of Hopes, that they do good, tho' they know nothing about it. But what Comfort can a con&s;ciencious Man, who travels in Birth, that Chri&s;t may be form'd in his Hearers Hearts, take
<PB N="13" REF="004610_0013_100DABA172E1DD18">from what he knows not? Will a hungry Stomach be &s;atisfied with Dreams about Meat? I believe not; tho' I confe&s;s a full one may.</P>
<P>What if &s;ome In&s;tances could be &s;hewn, of un|converted Mini&s;ters being In&s;trumental, in convin|cing Per&s;ons of their lo&s;t State? The Thing is very rare, and extraordinary. And for what I know, as many In&s;tances may be given, of Satan's convincing Per&s;ons, by his Temptations. Indeed it's a kind of Chance-medly, both in re&s;pect of the Father; and his Children; when any &s;uch Event happens. And isn't this tho Rea&s;on, why a Work of Conviction and Conver&s;ion has been &s;o rarely heard of, for a long Time, in the Churches, till of late, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Bulk of her &s;piritual Guides, were &s;tone-blind, and &s;tone-dead?</P>
<P N="4">4. The Mini&s;try of natural Men is dangerous, both in re&s;pect of the Doctrines, and Practice of Piety. The Doctrines of <HI>Originol Sin, Ju&s;ti&s;ication by Faith alone,</HI> and the other Points of <HI>Calvini&s;m,</HI> are very cro&s;s to the Grain of unrenew'd Nature. And tho' Men, by the In&s;luence of a good Education, and Hopes of Preferment, may have the Edge of their natural Enmity again&s;t them blunted; yet it's far from being broken or removed: It's only the &s;aving Grace of God, that can give us a true Re|li&s;h for tho&s;e Nature-humbling Doctrines; and &s;o effectually &s;ecure us from being infected by the con|trary. Is not the Carnality of the Mini&s;try, one great Cau&s;e of the general Spread of <HI>Arminiani&s;m. Sociniani&s;m, Ariani&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;m,</HI> at this Day through the World?</P>
<P>And alas! what poor Guides are natural Mini|&s;ters to tho&s;e, who are under &s;piritual Trouble? they either &s;light &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s altogether, and call it Melancholy, or Madne&s;s, or dawb tho&s;e that are under it, with untemper'd Mortar. Our LORD
<PB N="14" REF="004610_0014_100DABA34F8799E8">a&s;&s;ures us, That the Salt which hath lo&s;t its Savour, is good for nothing; &s;ome &s;ay, 'It genders Worns and Vermine. Now, what Savour have Phari&s;ee-Mini&s;ters? In Truth, a very &s;tinking One, both in the No&s;trils of God and good Men. <Q>Be the&s;e Moral Negroes never &s;o white in the Mouth, (as One expre&s;&s;eth is) yet will they hinder, in&s;tead of helping others, in at the &s;trait Gate.</Q> Hence is that Threatning of our LORD, agam&s;t them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.13. <HI>We unto you, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, Hypocrites; for ye &s;hut up the Kingdom of Heaven again&s;t Men; for ye neither go in your&s;elves, nor &s;uffer tho&s;e that are entering, to go in.</HI> Phari&s;ee-Teachers will with the utmo&s;t Hate oppo&s;e the very Work of God's Spirit, upon the Souls of Men; and labour by all Means to blacken it, as well as the In&s;truments, which the Almighty improves to promote the &s;ame; if it comes near their Borders, and interferes with their Credit or Intere&s;t. Thus did the Phari&s;ees deal with our Saviour.</P>
<P>If it be objected again&s;t what has been offered, under this General Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, That <HI>Judas</HI> was &s;ent by Chri&s;t; I an&s;wer,
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) That <HI>Judas</HI>'s Mini&s;try was partly Legal, ina&s;much as during that Period, the Di&s;ciples were &s;ubject to Jewi&s;h Ob&s;er|vances, and &s;ent only to the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Matth. 10.5, 6. And in that they waited after Chri&s;t's Re|&s;urrection, for another Mi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Acts</HI> 1.4. which we find they obtained, and that different from the for|mer. <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) <HI>Judas</HI>'s Mini&s;try was extraordinary nece&s;&s;ary, in order to fulfil &s;ome an|tient Prophe&s;ies concerning him. <HI>Acts</HI> 1.16, 17, 18, 20. <HI>Joh.</HI> 13.18. I fear that the Abu&s;e of this In|tance, has brought many <HI>Juda&s;es</HI> into the Mini&s;try, who&s;e chief De&s;ire, like their great Grandfather, is to &s;inger the Pence, and carry the Bag. But let &s;uch hireling murderous Hypocrites take Care, that
<PB N="15" REF="004610_0015_100DABA5F487E428">they don't feel the Force of a Halter in this World, and an aggravated Damnation in the next.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Again, if it be objected, That <HI>Paul</HI> rejoyced, that the Go&s;pel was preached, tho' of Contention, and not &s;incerely; I an&s;wer, The Expre&s;&s;ion &s;igni|fies the Apo&s;tle's great Self-Denyal. Some laboured to eclip&s;e his Fame and Character, by contentious Preaching, thinking thereby to afflict him; but they were mi&s;taken; as to that, he was ea&s;y: For he had long before learned, to die to his own Re|putation. The Apo&s;tle's Rejoycing was compara|tive only: He would rather that Chri&s;t &s;hould be preached out of Envy, than not at all. E&s;pecially con&s;idering the gro&s;s Ignorance of the Doctrinal Knowledge of the Go&s;pel, which prevailed almo&s;t univer&s;ally in that Age of the World. Be&s;ides the Apo&s;tle knew that that Tryal &s;hould be &s;anctified to him, to promote his &s;piritual Progre&s;s in Goodne&s;s, and perhaps prove a Mean of procuring his temporal Freedom; and therefore he would rejoyce. It is certain, we may both rejoyce and mourn, in rela|tion to the same Thing, upon different Accounts, without any Contradiction. But the</P>
<P>THIRD GENERAL HEAD, was to &s;hew, <HI>How Pity &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed upon this mournful Occa&s;ion!</HI></P>
<P>My Brethren, we &s;hould mourn over tho&s;e, that are de&s;titute of faithful Mini&s;ters, and &s;ympathize with them. Our Bowels &s;hould be moved with the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate Tenderne&s;s, over tho&s;e dear fainting Souls, that are <HI>as Sheep having no Shepherd;</HI> and that after the Example of our ble&s;&s;ed LORD.</P>
<P>Dear Sirs! we &s;hould al&s;o mo&s;t earne&s;tly pray for them, that the compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour may pre&s;erve them, by his mighty Power, thro' Faith unto Salva|tion; &s;upport their &s;inking Spirits, under the me|lancholy Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es of a dead Mini&s;try: &s;anctify
<PB N="16" REF="004610_0016_100DABA8A2E0E0F8">and &s;weeten to them the dry Mor&s;els they get under &s;uch blind Men, when they have none better to repair to.</P>
<P>And more e&s;pecially, my Brethren, we &s;hould pray to the LORD of the Harve&s;t, to &s;end forth faithful Labourers into his Harve&s;t; &s;eeing that the Harve&s;t truly is plenteous, but the Labourers are few. And O Sirs! how humble, believing, and importunate &s;hould we be in this Petition! O! let us follow the LORD, Day and Night, with Cries, Tears, Plead|ings, and Groanings upon this Account! For GOD knows, there is great Nece&s;&s;ity of it. O! thou Fountain of Merey, and Father of Pity, pour forth upon thy poor Children a Spirit of Prayer, for the Obtaining this important Mercy! Help, help, O Eternal GOD and Father, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake!</P>
<P>And indeed, my Brethren, we &s;hould join our Endravoure to our Prayers. The mo&s;t likely Me|thod to &s;tock the Church with a faithful Mini&s;try in the pre&s;ent Situation of Things, the publick Aca|demies being &s;o much corrupted and abu&s;ed general|ly, is, To encourage private Schools, or Seminaries of Learning, which are under the Care of &s;kilful and experienced Chri&s;tians; in which tho&s;e only &s;hould be admitted, who upon &s;trict Examination, have in the Judgment of a rea&s;onable Charity, the plain E|vidences of experimental Religion. Pious and ex|perienced Youths, who have a good natural Capa|city, and great De&s;ires after the Mini&s;terial Work, from good Motives, might be &s;ought for, and found up and down in the Country, and put to Private Schools of the Prophets; e&s;pecially in &s;uch Places, where the Publick ones are not. This Method, in my Opinion, has a noble Tendency, to build up the Church of God. And tho&s;e who have any Love to Chri&s;t, or De&s;ive after the Coming of his King|dom, &s;hould be ready, according to their Ability, to
<PB N="17" REF="004610_0017_100DABAA300F1DA8">give &s;omewhat, from time to time, for the Support of &s;uch poor Youths, who have nothing of their own. And truly, Brethren, this Charity to the Souls of Men, is the mo&s;t noble kind of Charity. O! if the Love of God be in you, it will con&s;train you to do &s;omething, to promote &s;o noble and nece&s;&s;ary a Work. It looks Hypocrite-like to go no further, when other Things are required, than cheap Prayer. Don't think it much, if the Phari&s;ees &s;hould be offended at &s;uch a Propo&s;al; the&s;e &s;ubtle &s;elfi&s;h Hypocrites are wont to be &s;car'd about their Credit, and their King|dom; and truly they are both little worth, for all the Bu&s;tle they make about them. If they could help it, they wou'dn't let one faithful Man come into the Mini&s;try; and therefore their Oppo&s;ition is an en|couraging Sign. Let all the Followers of the Lamb &s;tand up and act for GOD again&s;t all Oppo&s;ers: Who is upon GOD's Side? who?</P>
<P>THE IMPROVEMENT of this Subject remains. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. If it be &s;o, That the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e, who have no other, or no better than Phari&s;ee-Teachers, is to be pitied: Then what a Scrole and Scene of Mourn|ing, and Lamentation, and Wo, is opened! becau&s;e of the Swarms of Locu&s;ts, the Crowds of Phari&s;ees, that have as covetou&s;ly as cruelly, crept into the Mini&s;try, in this adulterous Generation! who as nearly re&s;emble the Character given of the old Pha|ri&s;ees, in the Doctrinal Part of this Di&s;cour&s;e, as one Crow's Egg does another. It is true &s;ome of the modern Phari&s;ees have learned to prate a little more orthodoxly about the New Birth, than their Prede|ce&s;&s;or <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> who are, in the mean Time, as great Strangers to the feeling Experience of it, as he. They are blind who &s;ee not this to be the Ca&s;e of the Body of the Clergy, of this Generation. And O!
<PB N="18" REF="004610_0018_100DABABF347BB38">that our Heads were Waters, and our Eyes a Foun|tain of Tears, that we could Day and Night lament, with the atmo&s;t Bitterne&s;s, the doleful Ca&s;e of the poor Church of God, upon this account.</P>
<P N="2">2. From what has been &s;aid, we may learn, That &s;uch who are contented under a dead Mini&s;try, have not in them the Temper of that Saviour they profe&s;s. It's an awful Sign, that they are as blind as Moles, and as dead as Stones, without any &s;piritual Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h. And alas! isn't this the Ca&s;e of Multi|tudes? If they can get one, that has the Name of a Mini&s;ter, with a Band, and a Black Coat or Gown to carry on a Sabbath-days among them, although never &s;o coldly, and in&s;ucce&s;sfully; if he is free from gro&s;s Crimes in Practice, and takes good Care to keep at a due Di&s;tance from their Con&s;ciences, and is never troubled about his In&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s; O! think the poor Fools, that is a fine Man indeed; our Mi|ni&s;ter is a prudent charitable Man, he is not always harping upon Terror, and &s;ounding Damnation in our Ears, like &s;ome ra&s;h-headed Preachers, who by their uncharitable Methods, are ready to put poor People out of their Wits, or to run them into De|&s;pair; O! how terrible a Thing is that De&s;pair! Ay, our Mini&s;ter, hone&s;t Man, gives us good Cau|tion again&s;t it. Poor &s;illy Souls! con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah, c.</HI> 5.30, 31.</P>
<P N="3">3. We may learn, the Mercy and Duty of tho&s;e that enjoy a faithful Mini&s;try. Let &s;uch glorify GOD, for &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a Privilege, and labour to walk worthy of it, to all Well-plea&s;ing; le&s;t for their Abu&s;e thereof, they be expo&s;ed to a greater Damna|tion.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the Mini&s;try of natural Men be as it has been repre&s;ented; Then it is both lawful and expe|dient to go from them to hear Godly Per&s;ons; yea, it's &s;o far from being &s;inful to do this, that one who
<PB N="19" REF="004610_0019_100DABAF3272FA60">lives under a pious Mini&s;ter of le&s;&s;er Gifts after having hone&s;tly endeavour'd to get Benefit by his Mini&s;try, and yet gets little or none, but doth find real Benefit and more Benefit el&s;ewhere; I &s;ay, he may lawfully go, and that frequently, where he gets mo&s;t Good to his precious Soul, after regular Appli|cation to the Pa&s;tor where he lives, for his Con&s;ent, and propo&s;ing the Rea&s;ons thereof; when this is done in the Spirit of Love and Meekne&s;s, without Contempt of any, as al&s;o without ra&s;h Anger, or vain Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Natural Rea&s;on will inform us, that Good is de|&s;ireable for its own &s;ake. Now, as Dr. <HI>Voetius</HI> ob|&s;erves, Good added to Good, makes it a greater Good, and &s;o more de&s;ireable; and therefore Evil as Evil, or a le&s;&s;er Good, which is comparatively Evil, cannot be the Object of De&s;ire.</P>
<P>There is a natural In&s;tinct put even into the irra|tional Creatures, by the Author of their Being, to &s;eek after the greater natural Good, as far as they know it. Hence the Birds of the Air fly to the warmer Climaets, in order to &s;hun the Winter-Cold, and al&s;o doubtle&s;s to get better Food; <HI>For where the Carca&s;s is, there the Eagles will be gathered together.</HI> The Bea&s;ts of the Field &s;eek the be&s;t Pa&s;tures, and the Fi&s;hes of the Ocean &s;eek after the Food they like be&s;t.</P>
<P>But the written Word of God confirms the afore|&s;aid Propo&s;ition, while God by it enjoins us, <HI>to covet earne&s;tly the be&s;t Gifts;</HI> as al&s;o <HI>to prove all Things, and hold fa&s;t that which is good.</HI> 1 Cor. 12.31. 1 The&s;&s;. 5.2. And is it not the Command of God, that we &s;hould <HI>grow in Grace?</HI> 2 Pet. 3.18. and 1 Pet. 2.2. Now, does not every po&s;itive Com|mand enjoin the U&s;e of &s;uch Means, as have the directe&s;t Tendency to an&s;wer the End de&s;igned? namely, The Duty commanded. If there be a
<PB N="20" REF="004610_0020_100DABB1E1FD2430">Variety of Means, is not the be&s;t to be cho&s;en? el&s;e how can the Choice be called rational, and be|coming an intelligent Creature? To chu&s;e otherwi&s;e knowingly, is it not contrary to common Sen&s;e, as well as Religion, and daily confuted by the common Practice of all the rational Creation, about Things of far le&s;s Moment and Con&s;equence?</P>
<P>That there is a Difference and Variety in Prea|chers Gifts and Graces, is undeniably evident, from the united Te&s;timony of Scripture and Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>And that there is a great Difference in the De|grees of Hearers Edification, under the Hearing of the&s;e different Gifts, is as evident to the Feeling of experienced Chri&s;tians, as any Thing can be to Sight.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o an unque&s;tionable Truth, that ordinarily GOD ble&s;&s;es mo&s;t the be&s;t Gifts, for the Hearers Edification, as by the be&s;t Food he gives the be&s;t Nouri&s;hment. Otherwi&s;e the be&s;t Gifts would not be de&s;ireable, and GOD Almighty in the ordinary Cour&s;e of his Providence, by not acting according to the Nature of Things, would be carrying on a Series of unnece&s;&s;ary Miracles; which to &s;uppo&s;e, is unrea&s;onable. The following Places of holy Scripture, confirm what has been la&s;t ob&s;erved. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.12 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14, 15, 16. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6. <HI>&amp; Act.</HI> 11.24.</P>
<P>If God's People have a Right to the Gifts of all God's Mini&s;ters, pray, why mayn't they u&s;e them, as they have Opportunity? And if they &s;hould go a few Miles farther than ordinary, to enjoy tho&s;e, which they profit mo&s;t by; who do they wrong? Now, our LORD does inform his People, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.22. That <HI>whether</HI> Paul, <HI>or</HI> Apollos, <HI>or</HI> Cephas; <HI>all was theirs.</HI></P>
<P>But the Example of our Dear Redeemer, will give farther Light in this Argument. Tho' many of the Hearers, not only of the Phari&s;ees, but of
<PB N="21" REF="004610_0021_100DABB3B0FE7330"><HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> came to hear our Saviour, and that not only upon Week-days, but upon Sabbath|days, and that in great Numbers, and from very di&s;tant Places; yet he reproved them not: And did not our Lord love the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> more than the re&s;t, and took him with him, before others, with <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>James,</HI> to Mount <HI>Tabor,</HI> and <HI>Geth|&s;emany?</HI> Matth. 17. and c. 26.</P>
<P>To bind Men to a particular Mini&s;ter, again&s;t their Judgment and Inclinations, when they are more edified el&s;ewhere, is carnal with a Witne&s;s; a cruel Oppre&s;&s;ion of tender Con&s;ciences, a Compel|ling of Men to Sin: For he that doubts, is damn'd if he eat; and what&s;oever is not of Faith, is Sin.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides it is an un&s;criptural Infringment on Chri|&s;tian Liberty; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.22. It's a Yoke wor&s;e than that of <HI>Rome</HI> it&s;elf. Dr. <HI>Voetius</HI> a&s;&s;erts, <Q>That even among the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> as to Hearing of Sermons, the People are not deprived of the Liberty of Choice.</Q> It's a Yoke like that of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which cruel <HI>Pharaoh</HI> formed for the Necks of the oppre&s;&s;ed <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> when he obliged them to make up their &s;tated Ta&s;k of Brick, but allowed them no Straw. So we mu&s;t grow in Grace and Knowledge; but in the mean time, according to the Notion of &s;ome, we are con|fined from u&s;ing the likelie&s;t Means, to attain that End.</P>
<P>If the great Ends of Hearing may be attained as well, and better, by Hearing of another Mini&s;ter than our own; then I &s;ee not, why we &s;hould be under a fatal Nece&s;&s;ity of hearing him, I mean our Pari&s;h-Mini&s;ter, perpetually, or generally. Now, what are, or ought to be, the Ends of Hearing, but the Getting of Grace, and Growing in it? <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14.1 <HI>Pot.</HI> 2.2. <HI>As Babes de&s;ire the &s;incere Milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby.</HI> (Poor Babes like not dry Brea&s;ts, and living Men like not dead
<PB N="22" REF="004610_0022_100DABB54C052600">Pools.) Well then, and may not the&s;e Ends be ob|tained out of our Pari&s;h-line? <HI>Faith</HI> is &s;aid to come by <HI>Hearing,</HI> Rom. 10. But the Apo&s;tle doesn't add, <HI>Your Pari&s;h-Mini&s;ter.</HI> Isn't the &s;ame Word preach'd out of our Pari&s;h? and is there any Re&s;triction in the Promi&s;es of ble&s;&s;ing the Word to tho&s;e only, who keep within their Pari&s;h-line ordinarily? If there be, I have not yet met with it; yea, I can affirm, that &s;o far as Knowledge can be had in &s;uch Ca&s;es, I have known Per&s;ons to get &s;aving Good to their Souls, by Hearing over their Pari&s;h-line; and this makes me earne&s;t in Defence of it.</P>
<P>That which ought to be the main Motive of Hearing any, <HI>viz.</HI> our Souls Good, or greater Good, will excite us, if we regard our own eternal Inter|e&s;t, to hear there, where we attain it; and he that hears with le&s;s Views, acts like a Fool, and a Hy|pocrite.</P>
<P>Now, if it be lawful to withdraw from the Mini|&s;try of a pious Man, in the Ca&s;e afore&s;aid; how much more, from the Mini&s;try of a natural Man? Surely, it is both lawful and expedient, for the Rea|&s;ons offered in the Doctrinal Part of this Di&s;cour&s;e: To which let me add a few Words more.</P>
<P>To tru&s;t the Care of our Souls to tho&s;e who have little or no Care for their own, to tho&s;e who are both un&s;kilful and unfaithful, is contrary to the common Practice of con&s;iderate Mankind, relating to the Affairs of their Bodies and E&s;tates; and would &s;ignify, that we &s;et light by our Souls, and did not care what became of them. For if the Blind lead the Blind, will they not both fall into the Ditch?</P>
<P>Is it a &s;trange Thing to think, that GOD does not ordinarily u&s;e the Mini&s;try of his Enemies, to turn others to be his Friends, &s;eeing he works by &s;uitable Means?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004610_0023_100DABB8205436F0">
I cannot think, that GOD has given any Pro|mi&s;e, that he will be with, and ble&s;s the Labours of natural Mini&s;ters: For if he had, he would be &s;ure|ly as good as his Word. But I can neither &s;ee, nor hear of any Ble&s;&s;ing upon the&s;e Men's Labours; un|le&s;s it be a rare and wonderful In&s;tance of Chance|medly! whereas the Mini&s;try of faithful Men blo&s;|&s;oms and bears Fruit, as the Rod of <HI>Aaron.</HI> Jer. 23. 22. <HI>But if they had &s;tood in my Coun&s;el, and had cau&s;ed my People to hear my Words, then they &s;hould have turned them from their evil Way, and from the Evil of their Doings.</HI></P>

<P>I an&s;wer, That the afore&s;aid Practice, accompa|nied with Love, Meekne&s;s, and Humility, is not the proper <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of tho&s;e Divi&s;ions, but the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> only, or the Cau&s;e by Accident, and not by it&s;elf. If a Per&s;on exerci&s;ing Mode&s;ty and Love in his Carriage to his Mini&s;ter and Neighbours, through Uprightne&s;s of Heart, de&s;igning nothing but his own greater Good, repairs there frequently where he attains it; is this any rea&s;onable Cau&s;e of Anger? will any be offended with him, becau&s;e he loves his Soul, and &s;eeks the greater Good thereof, and is not like a &s;en&s;ele&s;s Stone, without Choice, Sen&s;e, and Ta&s;te? Pray, mu&s;t we leave off every Duty, that is the Oc|ca&s;ion of Contention or Divi&s;ion? Then we mu&s;t quit powerful Religion altogether. For <HI>he that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer Per&s;ecution.</HI> And particularly we mu&s;t carefully avoid faithful Preaching: For that is wont to occa&s;ion Di&s;turban|ces and Divi&s;ions, e&s;pecially when accompanied with divine Power. 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 1.5, 6. <HI>Our Go&s;pol came not unto you in Word only, but in Power:</HI> And then it is added, That they <HI>received the Word in much Af|fliction.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> informs us, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.9. That a great Door and effectual was open'd unto him, and that there were many Adver&s;aries. Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Paul</HI> was accounted a common Di&s;turber of the Peace, as well as <HI>Elijah</HI> long before him: And yet he left not off Prenching for all that. Yea, our
<PB N="25" REF="004610_0025_100DABBC430AE288">ble&s;&s;ed LORD informs us, That he came not to &s;end Peace on Earth, but rather a Sword, Variance, Fire, and Divi&s;ion, and that even among Relations. <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.34, 35, 36. <HI>Luke</HI> 12.49, 51, 52, 53. As al&s;o, That while the &s;trong Man armed keeps the Hou&s;e, all the Goods are in Peace. It is true the Power the Go&s;pel is not the proper Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Divi&s;ions, but the innocent Occa&s;ion only: No; the proper Cau&s;e of &s;inful Divi&s;ions, is that Enmity again&s;t GOD, and Holine&s;s, which is in the Hearts of natural Men, of every Order; being &s;tirred up by the Devil, and their own proud and &s;elfi&s;h Lu&s;ts. And very often natural Men, who are the proper Cau&s;es of the Divi&s;ions afore&s;aid, are wont to deal with God's Servants, as <HI>Potiphar</HI>'s Wife did by <HI>Jo&s;eph;</HI> they lay all the Blame of their own Wicked|ne&s;s at their Doors, and make a loud Cry!</P>
<P>Such as confine Oppo&s;ition and Divi&s;ion, as fol|lowing upon living Godline&s;s and &s;ucce&s;sful Preach|ing, to the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianity; it is much to be fear'd neither know them&s;elves, nor the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. For &s;urely the nature of true Religion, as well as of Men and Devils, is the &s;ame in every Age.</P>
<P>Is not the vi&s;ible Church compo&s;ed of Per&s;ons of the mo&s;t contrary Characters? While &s;ome are &s;incere Servants of God, are not many Servants of Satan, under a religious Ma&s;k? and have not the&s;e a fixed Enmity again&s;t the other? How is it then po&s;&s;ible, that a Harmony &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between &s;uch, till their Nature be changed? Can Light dwell with Darkne&s;s?</P>
<P>Undoubtedly it is a great Duty, to avoid giving ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence to any; and it is al&s;o highly nece&s;&s;ary, that pious Souls &s;hould maintain Union and Harmony among them&s;elves; notwith&s;tanding of their different Opinions in le&s;&s;er Things. And
<PB N="26" REF="004610_0026_100DABBE823E7A68">no doubt this is the Drift of the many Exhortations which we have to Peace and Unity in Scripture.</P>
<P>Surely, it cannot be rea&s;onably &s;uppos'd, that we are exhorted to a Unity in any Thing that is wicked, or incon&s;i&s;tent with the Good, or greater Good of our poor Souls: For that would be like the Unity of the Devils, a Logion of which dwelt peaceably in one Man: Or like the Unity of <HI>Ahab</HI>'s fal&s;e Prophets; all the&s;e four Hundred Daubers were very peaceable and much united, and all harped on the plea&s;ing String: Ay, they were moderate Men, and had the Majority on their Side.</P>
<P>But po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may again object again&s;t Per&s;ons going to hear others, be&s;ides their own Mini&s;ters; the Scripture about <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Apollos,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.12. and &s;ay, that it is carnal. Dr. <HI>Voetius</HI> an&s;wers the afore&s;aid Objection, as follows: <Q>The Apo&s;tle re|proves (&s;ays he) &s;uch as made Sects, &s;aying, <HI>I am of Paul, and I of Apollos</HI>&mdash;and we with him re|prove them. But this is far from being again&s;t the Choice, which one hath of Sermons and Preachers; &s;eeing at one time we cannot hear all, neither doth the Explication and Application of all, equally &s;uit &s;uch a Per&s;on, in &s;uch a Time, or Condition, or equally quicken, and &s;ub&s;erve the Encrea&s;e of Knowledge.</Q> Thus far he.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e that the Apo&s;tle, in the afore&s;aid Place, reproves an exce&s;&s;ive Love to, or Admiration of particular Mini&s;ters, accompanied with a &s;inful Contention, Slighting and Di&s;daining of others, who are truly godly, and with Sect-making: To &s;ay that from hence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, That we mu&s;t make no Difference in our Choice, or in the De|grees of our E&s;teem of different Mini&s;ters, according to their different Gifts and Graces; is an Argument of as great Force, as to &s;ay, Becau&s;e Gluttony and Drunkenne&s;s are forbidden, therefore we mu&s;t nei|ther
<PB N="27" REF="004610_0027_100DABC0924CB140">eat nor drink, or make any Choice in Drinks or Victuals, let our Con&s;titution be what it will.</P>
<P>Surely the very Nature of Chri&s;tian Love inclines tho&s;e that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, to love others chiefly for their Goodne&s;s, and therefore in Proportion, thereto. Now, &s;eeing the Inference in the Ob|jection is &s;ecretly built upon this Suppo&s;ition, That we &s;hould love all good Men alike; it &s;trikes at the Foundations of that Love to the Brethren, which is laid down in Scripture, as a Mark of true Chri|&s;tianity, x <HI>Job.</HI> 5. and &s;o is carnal, with a Witne&s;s.</P>
<P>Again it may be objected, That the afore&s;aid Practice tends to grieve our Pari&s;h-Mini&s;ter, and to break Congregations in Pieces.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, If our Pari&s;h-Mini&s;ter be grieved at our greater Good, or prefers his Credit before it; then he has good Cau&s;e to grieve over his own Rottenne&s;s and Hypocri&s;ie. And as for Breaking of Congregations to Pieces, upon the Account of People's Going from Place to Place, to hear the Word, with a View to get greater Good; that &s;piritual Blindne&s;s and Death, that &s;o generally pre|vails, will put this out of Danger. It is but a very few, that have got any &s;piritual Reli&s;h; the mo&s;t will venture their Souls with any Formali&s;t, and be well &s;atisfied with the &s;aple&s;s Di&s;cour&s;es of &s;uch dead Drones.</P>
<P>Well, doesn't the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ert, That <HI>Paul and Apollos are nothing?</HI> Yes, it is true, they and all others are nothing as Efficient Cau&s;es; they could not change Men's Hearts. But were they nothing as In&s;truments? The Objection in&s;inuates one of the&s;e two Things, either that there is no Difference in Means, as to their Suitablene&s;s; or that there is no Rea&s;on to expect a greater Ble&s;&s;ing upon the mo&s;t &s;uitable Means: Both which are equally ab&s;urd, and before confuted.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="004610_0028_100DABC3580DB318">
But it may be further objected, with great Ap|pearance of Zeal, That what has been &s;aid about People's Getting of Good, or greater Good, over their Pari&s;h-line, is a meer Fiction; for they are out of God's Way.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, That there are Three mon&s;trous In|gredients in the Objection, namely, A Begging of the Que&s;tion in Debate, ra&s;h Judging, and Limit|ing of God.</P>
<P>It is a mean Thing in Rea&s;oning, to beg or &s;up|po&s;e that, which &s;hould be prov'd, and then to rea|&s;on from it. Let it be prov'd, that they are out of God's Way; and then I will freely yield: But till this be done, bold Say&s;oes will not have much Weight with any but Dupes or Dunces. And for &s;uch who cry out again&s;t others for Uncharitablene&s;s, to be guilty of it them&s;elves in the mean time in a very great Degree, is very incon&s;i&s;tent. Isn't it ra&s;h to judge of Things they have never heard? But tho&s;e that have received Benefit, and are &s;en&s;ible of their own Uprightne&s;s, they will think it a light Thing, to be judged of Man's Judgment. Let <HI>Ter|tullus</HI> a&s;cend the Theatre, and gild the Objection with the mo&s;t mellifluous Ciceronean Eloquence; it will no more per&s;wade them, that what they have felt is but a Fancy (unle&s;s they be under &s;trong Temptations of Satan, or&s;cared out of their Wits by frightful Expre&s;&s;ions) than to tell a Man, in proper Language, that &s;ees, That it is but a Notion, he does not &s;ee: Or to tell a Man that feels Plea&s;ure or Pain, That it's but a deluded Fancy; they are quite mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides there is a Limiting the Holy One of I&s;rael, in the afore&s;aid Objection, which &s;inful Sin the <HI>He|brews</HI> were reproved for. It is a Piece of daring Pre|&s;umption, to pretend by our finite Line, to fathom the infinite Depths that are in the Being and Works
<PB N="29" REF="004610_0029_100DABC5BB3EFA18">of God. The Query of <HI>Zophar</HI> is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, <HI>Job</HI> 11.7, 8. <HI>Can&s;t thou by Searching find out GOD?</HI>&mdash; The humble Apo&s;tle with A&s;toni&s;hment acknowled|ged, that the Ways of GOD were pa&s;t finding out. <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.33. Surely the Wind blows where it li&s;teth, and we cannot tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth. Doesn't JEHOVAH ride upon a gloomy Cloud? and make Darkne&s;s his Pavilion? and isn't his Path in the great Waters? <HI>P&s;.</HI> 18. <HI>P&s;.</HI> 77.19.</P>
<P>I would conclude my pre&s;ent Meditations upon this Subject, by Exhorting</P>
<P>All tho&s;e who enjoy a faithful Mini&s;try, to a &s;peedy and &s;incere Improvement of &s;o rare and valu|able a Privilege; le&s;t by their fooli&s;h Ingratitude the Righteous GOD be provok'd, to remove the Means they enjoy, or his Ble&s;&s;ing from them, and &s;o at la&s;t to expo&s;e them in another State to Endur|ing and greater Mi&s;eries. For &s;urely, the&s;e Sins which are committed again&s;t greater Light and Mercy, are more pre&s;umptuous, ungrateful, and inexcu&s;able; there is in them a greater Contempt of GOD's Authority, and Slight of his Mercy; tho&s;e Evils do awfully violate the Con&s;cience, and declare a Love to Sin as Sin; &s;uch Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors do ru&s;h upon the Bo&s;&s;es of GOD's Buckler, they court De&s;truction without a Covering, and embrace their own Ruin with open Arms. And therefore accord|ing to the Nature of Ju&s;tice, which proportions Sin|ners Pains, according to the Number and Heinou&s;|ne&s;s of their Crimes, and the Declaration of divine Truth, you mu&s;t expect an en&s;lamed Damnation: Surely, it &s;hall be more tolerable for <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Go|morrah,</HI> in the Day of the LORD, than for you, except ye repent.</P>
<P>And let gracious Souls be exhorted, to expre&s;s the mo&s;t tender Pity over &s;uch as have none but Phari|&s;ee-Teachers; and that in the Manner before de|&s;cribed:
<PB N="30" REF="004610_0030_100DABC83A0180A8">To which let the Example of our LORD in the Text before us, be an inducing and effectual Incitement; as well as the gracious and immen&s;e Rewards, which follow upon &s;o generous and noble a Charity, in this and the next State.</P>
<P>And let tho&s;e who live under the Mini&s;try of dead Men, whether they have got the Form of Reli|gion or not, repair to the Living, where they may be edified. Let who will, oppo&s;e it. What famous Mr. <HI>Jenner</HI> ob&s;erves upon this Head, is mo&s;t ju&s;t, <Q>That if there be any godly Soul, or any that de|&s;ires the Salvation of his Soul, and lives under a blind Guide, he cannot go out (of his Pari&s;h without giving very great Offence; it will be tho't a Giddine&s;s, and a Slighting of his own Mi|ni&s;ter at home.&mdash; When People came out of every Pari&s;h round about, to <HI>John,</HI> no Que&s;tion but this bred Heart-burning again&s;t <HI>John,</HI> ay, and Ill-will again&s;t tho&s;e People, that would not be &s;atisfied with that Teaching they had in their own Synagogues.</Q> Thus far he. But tho' your Neigh|bours growl again&s;t you, and reproach you for doing your Duty, in &s;eeking your Souls Good; bear their unju&s;t Cen&s;ures with Chri&s;tian Meekne&s;s, and per|&s;evere; as knowing that Suffering is the Lot of Chri&s;t's Followers, and that &s;piritual Benefits do infinitely overbalance all temporal Difficulties.</P>
<P>And O! that vacant Congregations would take due Care in the Choice of their Mini&s;ters! Here indeed they &s;hould ha&s;ten &s;lowly. The Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> is commended, for Trying them which &s;aid they were Apo&s;tles, and were not; and for finding them Liars. Hypocrites are again&s;t all Knowing of others, and Judging, in order to hide their own Filthine&s;s; like Thieves they flee a Search, becau&s;e of their &s;tolen Goods. But the more they endeavour
<PB N="31" REF="004610_0031_100DABC9F19CAB18">to hide, the more they expo&s;e their Shame. Does <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;piritual Man judge all Things? Tho' he cannot know the States of &s;ubtil Hypocrites infal|libly; yet may he not give a near Gue&s;s, who are the Sons of <HI>Sceva,</HI> by their Manner of Praying, Preaching, and Living? Many Phari&s;ee-Teachers have got a long fine String of Prayer by Heart, &s;o that they are never at a Lo&s;s about it; their Prayers and Preachings are generally of a Length, and both as dead as a Stone, and without all Savour. I be|&s;eech you, my dear Brethren, to con&s;ider, That there is no Probability of your getting Good, by the Mini&s;try of Phari&s;ees. For they are no Shep|herds (no faithful ones) in Chri&s;t's Account. They are as good as none, nay, wor&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> none, upon &s;ome Accounts. For take them fir&s;t and la&s;t, and they generally do more Hurt than Good. They &s;erve to keep better out of the Places where they live; nay, when the Life of Piety comes near their Quar|ters, they ri&s;e up in Arms again&s;t it, con&s;ult, con|trive and combine in their Conclaves again&s;t it, as a common Enemy, that di&s;covers and condemns their Craft and Hypocri&s;ie. And with what Art, Rhetorick, and Appearances of Piety, will they varni&s;h their Oppo&s;ition of Chri&s;t's Kingdom? As the Magicians imitated the Works of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;o do fal&s;e Apo&s;tles, and deceitful Workers, the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Di&s;cour&s;e with the Words of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.14, 15.</P>
<P><HI>And no Marvel; for Satan him&s;elf is transformed into an Angel of Light: Therefore it is no great Thing if his Mini&s;ters al&s;o be transformed as the Mini&s;ters of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; who&s;e End &s;hall be according to their Works.</HI></P>
