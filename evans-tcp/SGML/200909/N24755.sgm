<HEAD>A TESTIMONY FROM THE MONTHLY MEETING OF PROVIDENCE CONCERNING JOB SCOTT.</HEAD>
<P>OUR beloved friend Job Scott was born in Providence the 18th of 10th month 1751, new &s;tyle, in that part of it now North-Providence. His parents were John and Lydia Scott, who gave him &s;uch opportunities as, through his turn for lite|rary improvement, he acquired both a competent &s;hare of common &s;chool learning, and made &s;ome progre&s;s in &s;ome other branches of literature.</P>
<P>In his young years it appears, that by di&s;regard|ing the reproofs of in&s;truction, manife&s;ted in his own mind, he was drawn into vanity, di&s;&s;ipation and folly. Repeated and great were his conflicts between his depraved propen&s;ities and the convic|tions of truth, but the latter humbling and melting his heart into contrition, he was graciou&s;ly favour|ed to &s;ee the evil of his ways, and the de&s;truction which awaited him if he did not reject the Tempt|er, for&s;ake his wicked companions, and turn to the Lord, in obedience to his holy law written in his heart; until at length he &s;o learned obedience by the things which he &s;uffered, that he gave up to the operations of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t upon him, in
<PB N="iv" REF="032810_0003_0FF52976D906AD60">
the faith of its divine, re&s;training, pre&s;erving and &s;anctifying power, and therein experienced the con&s;olation of his heavenly Father's love.</P>
<P>Being thus humbled under the various turnings of the Lord's hand upon him, and clearly convinc|ed of the power and efficacy of the di&s;tingui&s;hing principle of our holy profe&s;&s;ion, viz. the light of Chri&s;t within man, as God's gift for his &s;alvation; he reque&s;ted the care, and became a member, of the monthly meeting of Smithfield, then extend|ing to Providence; and being of &s;trong and ready abilities, and his mind improved and enlarged by the &s;anctifying power of Truth, he <HI>was enabled and zealou&s;ly</HI> and very u&s;efully di&s;po&s;ed for the promo|tion of the cau&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s in which he was engaged.</P>
<P>Having in the &s;chool of Chri&s;t mea&s;urably learn|ed the my&s;tery of the fall and re&s;toration of man, and to under&s;tand the &s;criptures and pertinently to apply them, he was brought under the preparing hand of the Lord for the work of the mini&s;try, under which di&s;pen&s;ation his &s;oul was deeply bap|tized and brought under great &s;ympathy with &s;eek|ing &s;ouls, who were travailing in birth that Chri&s;t might be formed in them, to whom he was at times and &s;ea&s;ons enabled powerfully to admini&s;ter encouragement and con&s;olation. Thus for &s;everal years, as well as by letters and epi&s;tles, for which he was eminently gifted with in&s;tructive and edify|ing talents, he laboured for the promotion of the cau&s;e of truth, now become precious in his &s;ight; and about the 23d year of his age he appeared in the mini&s;try at a publick meeting in Providence, ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the de&s;ire of his &s;oul, that 'Sion might ari&s;e and &s;hake her&s;elf from the du&s;t of the earth,
<PB N="v" REF="032810_0004_0FF529845ABB0098">
and put on her beautiful garments.' The gravity in which he appeared, the &s;ympathy which was felt, and the &s;olemnity of that &s;ea&s;on, are refre&s;hingly remembered by &s;ome to the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>At this time he taught a &s;chool in Providence, in which employ he continued for &s;everal years, and afterwards in Smithfield, much to the &s;atisfac|tion of his employers, and the children and youth under his care, who&s;e confidence and affections he very generally gained and pre&s;erved, to &s;ome of whom his memory is yet precious. In his attend|ance of all our religious meetings, and in the vari|ous duties of private life, as well as in the relations of &s;on, hu&s;band, parent and neighbour, he was truly exemplary. His appearance in the mini&s;try was not very frequent when at home, and he was frequently led into an example of &s;ilence when abroad, circum&s;pect not to mini&s;ter without fre&s;h anointing, and careful in attending clo&s;ely to the turnings of the key of David; well knowing when that &s;huts none can open, and therefore, when he perceived his &s;ubject to clo&s;e and the life withdraw, however clear his opening, and free the &s;pring of life had been at his beginning, he would &s;uddenly &s;it down, however in the cro&s;s; for he had a te&s;ti|mony to bear again&s;t all &s;uperficial and lifele&s;s mi|ni&s;try, and very exemplarily avoided it.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t vi&s;it abroad was to the northerly parts of the yearly meeting of New-York, which proved a &s;ea&s;on of clo&s;e, probation and conflict of mind, yet endeavouring to attend to the pointings of duty from place to place, he was, as appears by his cer|tificates, favoured to return with the approbation of tho&s;e he vi&s;ited; and by a pro&s;pect which it ap|pears he had as he was returning home, not whol|ly
<PB N="vi" REF="032810_0005_0FF529A575FA5C00">
unlike the apo&s;tle Paul's, 2 Cor. xii. he was &s;trengthened to per&s;everance in a dedication of heart to the Lord; for, in this luminous and extatic pro&s;pect, it appeared to him, that all his corrup|tions and &s;pots were <HI>made</HI> clean before the Lamb, and he made to partake of the con&s;olations and joys of the heavenly ho&s;t; yet like the apo&s;tle, he had &s;oon to experience a thorn in the fle&s;h, le&s;t he &s;hould be exalted above mea&s;ure, and even the me&s;&s;enger of Satan was permitted to buffet him; but he be&s;ought the Lord for his pre&s;ervation, and received the con&s;oling an&s;wer of 'my grace is &s;uf|ficient for thee; for my &s;trength is made perfect in weakne&s;s.' Thus buffeted, tried and tempted, he had to tread in the &s;teps of the great apo&s;tle and his dear Lord and Ma&s;ter, and thereby became more perfected through &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>He afterwards vi&s;ited New-York, New-Jer&s;ey and Penn&s;ylvania twice, and once the Southern &s;tates as far as Georgia, returning certificates of the approbation of tho&s;e he vi&s;ited, among whom we have good rea&s;on to believe he has left many &s;eals of his go&s;pel mini&s;try, and impre&s;&s;ions of near and dear unity and fellow&s;hip with him as a brother beloved, as well as in the&s;e and other parts of our own yearly meeting. He al&s;o vi&s;ited &s;ome part of the &s;tate of Connecticut, and had meetings among tho&s;e not of our &s;ociety. Soon after which a pro&s;|pect, that for &s;ome years before had opened to his view, of vi&s;iting Great-Britain and Ireland, had &s;o opened on his mind, as to induce him to open the &s;ame to his friends for their concurrence and cer|tificate. In the ninth month, 1792, he received one from this monthly meeting, and al&s;o one in the tenth month from our quarterly meeting for
<PB N="vii" REF="032810_0006_0FF529C46A40C9A8">
Rhode-I&s;land. On the 26th of the 11th month he took a &s;olemn leave of his family and friends at home, and &s;ailed from Bo&s;ton the 5th of the 12th month, for Dunkirk in France. On the pa&s;&s;age the &s;hip &s;prung a leak, and had a &s;evere gale of wind; but it appears this our friend was pre&s;erved, 're&s;igned and &s;tayed through all,' while the mari|ners on board were to&s;&s;ed with amazement and ter|ror; corre&s;ponding with a pro&s;pect which he re|ceived and recorded, in his journal left at home, about twelve months before he &s;ailed, on a view of which a &s;triking evidence is thereby rai&s;ed that prophecy or communication to the mind of future events has not cea&s;ed; but that the Lord &s;till con|tinues graciou&s;ly to open his vi&s;ions of light to his devoted &s;ervants by way of pointing to duty, fore|warning of events, and guiding the mind through them, in confirmation of divine &s;uperintendance, and their faith in his gracious appearance.</P>
<P>He arrived at Dunkirk the 5th of the 1&s;t month, and after tarrying there about ten days, much to his own and friends &s;atisfaction, he proceeded to England, taking &s;ome meetings in Kent, went to London, attended the different meetings in that city, then into Wales, and attended the &s;everal monthly and quarterly meetings and the yearly meeting at Carmathan, thence to Bri&s;tol, and, re|turning to London, attended the yearly meeting there, who, in their epi&s;tle to ours, &s;peak of him in a very &s;atisfactory manner. He then went to Liverpool, taking meetings in his way, and &s;o pa&s;&s;|ed over to Ireland, and vi&s;ited all the meetings of Friends and &s;ome of other &s;ocieties there; attended the national half-year's meeting in Dublin; and, while vi&s;iting a few meetings a &s;econd time, he
<PB N="viii" REF="032810_0007_0FF52998862C2788">
was taken ill of the &s;mall-pox, at the hou&s;e of our friend Elizabeth Shackleton, in Ballitore, from whence he dictated a letter on the 14th of the 11th month, to his relations and Friends; out of which, and an account taken by the Friends who attended him, we extract the following: he &s;ays, <Q>I am now twenty-eight Iri&s;h miles from Dublin, entered five days into the &s;mall-pox; I feel ea&s;ie&s;t to addre&s;s you principally, that you may know my mind enjoys that which removes beyond all &s;orrow.</Q> Of his children he &s;ays, <Q>I wi&s;h them to get a little more learning than &s;ome of them are at pre|&s;ent in the way of; and although I do not wi&s;h much of the world's poli&s;h, yet it is, at this awful moment, my de&s;ire that they may not be brought up with much ru&s;ticity, for this I believe has not very often contributed either to civil or religious u&s;efulne&s;s. My de&s;ire for my children's &s;ub&s;tan|tial growth in the truth, and &s;trict adherence to all its di&s;coveries to the clo&s;e of their days, is by far my principal wi&s;h for them. Out of the enjoy|ment of a good degree of this precious inheritance, I know of nothing in this world worth living for. Ye that know it, &s;uffer nothing, I mo&s;t cordially be&s;eech you, ever to divert your minds from an in|crea&s;ing and fervent pur&s;uit after the fulne&s;s of it; even unto the mea&s;ure and &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</Q> At another time he &s;aid, <Q>My &s;pirits are under little or no depre&s;&s;ion; perhaps I never &s;aw a time before, when all things not criminal were &s;o nearly alike to me in point of any di&s;turb|ance to the mind. When I verge a little towards &s;leep, I am all afloat, from the &s;tate of my nerves, and forced immediately from beginning repo&s;e; but through all, the &s;oul &s;eems deeply anchored
<PB N="ix" REF="032810_0008_0FF52A185391E340">
in God:</Q>&mdash;adding, <Q>My heart &s;eems melted with|in me in retro&s;pective view; all the former con|flicts, however grievous in their time, are lighter now than vanity, except as they are clearly &s;een to have contributed largely to the &s;anctification of the &s;oul; as they are remembered with awfulne&s;s and gratitude before Him who has not been wanting to pre&s;erve through them all; and as they &s;eem likely to introduce, before long, an exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</Q> At another time he &s;aid, <Q>It is the Lord that enables to coincide with his will, and &s;ay amen to all the trials and conflicts he permits to attend us. My mind is centred in <HI>that</HI> which brings into perfect acqui|e&s;cence. There is nothing in this world worth being enjoyed out of the divine will.</Q></P>
<P>He gave directions, that if he &s;hould go hence, every thing about his interment &s;hould be plain and &s;imple; expre&s;&s;ed his entire re&s;ignation to di|vine di&s;po&s;al; and that he found nothing to &s;tand between him and the Fountain of everla&s;ting love. At another time &s;aid, <Q>I have no fear, for perfect love ca&s;teth out all fear, and he that feareth is not perfected in love.</Q> His &s;tomach refu&s;ing all nouri&s;hment, and a hiccough coming on, he &s;aid, <Q>Do not force nature, let me pa&s;s quietly away to the eternal inheritance.</Q> Soon after &s;aid, <Q>I am waiting patiently to &s;ee the &s;alvation of God&mdash; do you wait patiently with me&mdash;I have no de&s;ire, nor the &s;hadow of a de&s;ire, to be re&s;tored&mdash;I hope the doctors will &s;oon find that they have done their part.</Q> To one he &s;aid, <Q>Thy being here has been an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction to me.</Q> Afterwards &s;aid, <Q>I have known &s;omething of that law of love whereby all boa&s;ting is entirely ex|cluded;

<HEAD>A Te&s;timony from the national half-year's meeting of Friends in Ireland concerning Job Scott, late of Providence, in the &s;tate of Rhode-I&s;land, &amp;c. in America.</HEAD>
<P>IT having plea&s;ed the Almighty to call, from works to rewards, this our beloved friend, we feel our minds engaged to give forth a te&s;timony concerning him.</P>
<P>From genuine marks evinced in the cour&s;e of his religious &s;ervices, we believe him to have been an in&s;trument fitted and prepared by the great Ma&s;ter, through deep and repeated bapti&s;m, for u&s;e
<PB N="xi" REF="032810_0010_0FF529A3DF758720">
and &s;ervice in his church militant; called and &s;ent forth by the immediate influences of his &s;pirit to publi&s;h the go&s;pel; and being pre&s;erved in an eminent degree, carefully attentive to the leadings thereof, the word of the Lord through him was often <Q>as a fire and as a hammer to break the rock in pieces.</Q> Many were the bitter cups al|lotted him, in the di&s;pen&s;ations of unerring wi&s;|dom, which though hard to fle&s;h and blood, yet he appeared not to &s;hrink therefrom; but in re|&s;ignation to the divine will, and a &s;urrender of his own, he was concerned to follow the Captain of his &s;alvation, who was made perfect through &s;uf|fering;&mdash;and thus by abiding under the power of the cro&s;s, he might well have adopted the language of the apo&s;tle, <Q>by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace which was be&s;towed on me was not in vain; but I laboured abundantly, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</Q></P>
<P>He was a diligent waiter to experience renewed qualification for &s;ervice before he attempted to move either in the mini&s;try or in the tran&s;actions of the di&s;cipline; as well knowing that without a fre&s;h anointing, any endeavours to act mu&s;t prove inef|fectual, and tend to centre in lifele&s;s formality, again&s;t which he was zealou&s;ly concerned to bear te&s;timony.</P>
<P>His conver&s;ation was coupled with fear, as well as &s;ea&s;oned with grace; and being deep in heavenly my&s;teries, he was cautious of &s;quandering the &s;ame, yet, when at liberty for conver&s;ation, his communi|cations were agreeable, and remarkably in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>He vi&s;ited the meetings of Friends in this na|tion&mdash;al&s;o had much religious &s;ervice among tho&s;e not in profe&s;&s;ion with us, and was a &s;harp thre&s;h|ing
<PB N="xii" REF="032810_0011_0FF52B25952D8240">
in&s;trument in the Lord's hand, again&s;t all who preached for hire and divined for money, being earne&s;tly concerned to call the people off from dead works, that they might be brought to experience the efficacy of true religion in the newne&s;s of life.</P>
<P>In his la&s;t illne&s;s, at the hou&s;e of our friend Elizabeth Shackleton, of Ballitore, he was much re&s;igned, although the di&s;order, which proved the &s;mall-pox, lay heavy on him. He &s;poke of the things of God, and tho&s;e that appertain to his kingdom, yet was very mode&s;t and diffident of his labours to promote them in the hearts of the peo|ple; but gave evident marks of his peace of mind, and a&s;&s;urance that he had no doubt of a man&s;ion of re&s;t prepared for him, where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and where the weary be at re&s;t, experiencing great &s;erenity and compo&s;ure even as a morning without clouds.</P>
<P>He departed this life the 22d of 11th mo. 1793, aged upwards of forty-two years, and has left an example which &s;peaks loudly to us his &s;urvivors, 'follow me, as I have followed Chri&s;t.'</P>

<P>I was born, according to the be&s;t account I could obtain, and according to the pre&s;ent or new &s;tyle, on the 18th day of the 10th month 1751&punc; in the town&s;hip of Providence, now North-Providence, in the colony (now &s;tate) of Rhode-I&s;land and Providence Plan|tations&punc; in New-England. My parents names were John and Lydia Scott; who were ac|counted hone&s;t people, though my father made but little profe&s;&s;ion of religion. My mother was more zealous, and attended Friends meetings when &s;he conveniently could, taking me divers times with her, and I think a few times another or two of the chil|dren; though we were all but young, for I being the elde&s;t was but ten years old when &s;he died. I can well remember the &s;erious im|pre&s;&s;ions and contemplations which, at that early period of life, and for &s;ome years before my mother's decea&s;e, attended my mind as I &s;at in meeting with her, and on the way home.

much to re&s;train us from being in the company of rude and vicious children, and would &s;ometimes call us together, and labour to have us &s;it in &s;ilence with her, which we did: and though I then under&s;tood but little of the intent of it, it has &s;ince afforded me a degree of &s;olid &s;atisfaction, in believing the Lord had given her to know and partake of the &s;ublime enjoyments and &s;ub&s;tantial bene|fits of true, inward, chri&s;tian &s;ilence, and waiting upon God; and that &s;he was de&s;irous we her children might, in our tender years, be made acquainted with at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;ecret touches of that divine favour which I doubt not &s;he felt and experienced in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons of retirement: and though, as I ob&s;erved, I un|der&s;tood but little about it then; yet I have &s;ince had rea&s;on to believe it was a real ad|vantage to me; and that it has often been remembered &s;ince to my benefit.</P>

<P>I was told by &s;ome of my kindred who were pre&s;ent at my mother's death (for it being night I was not pre&s;ent my&s;elf) that her de|parture was joyful and glorious; and that very near her la&s;t breath was &s;pent in fervent &s;upplication to the Lord her God.</P>
<P>And now, not at all doubting but her im|mortal &s;pirit is at re&s;t in Je&s;us, I leave her, and proceed to a further relation of the exer|ci&s;e of my own mind, having this te&s;timony to bear, that almo&s;t as early as I can remember any thing, I can well remember the Lord's &s;ecret workings in my heart, by his grace or holy &s;pirit; very &s;en&s;ibly bringing me under condemnation for my evil thoughts and ac|tions, as rudene&s;s and bad words, (though not frequent in the u&s;e of them) di&s;obedience to parents; inwardly wi&s;hing, in moments of anger, &s;ome evil to &s;uch as offended me; and &s;uch like childi&s;h and corrupt di&s;po&s;itions and practices, which over and beyond all outward in&s;truction I was made &s;en&s;ible were evil, and &s;prang from a real root of evil in me. And I am in a full belief, that in every quarter of the globe, children, at an early age, have good and evil &s;et before them, in the &s;hinings of the light of Chri&s;t in their hearts, with clear|ne&s;s

and evidence &s;ufficient to a&s;certain to them their duty, if they hone&s;tly attend to it. And though I am deeply &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;|&s;ity and utility of much careful guardian&s;hip, cultivation and in&s;truction, in order to guard children again&s;t the corrupting influence of example, invitation, and perver&s;e inclination, which abundantly and prevalently &s;urround them; yet I fear a great part of the tuition, which too many children receive, tends rather to blunt the true &s;en&s;e and evidence of divine truths upon the mind, and to &s;ub&s;titute no|tions and &s;y&s;tems in&s;tead thereof, than to en|courage an hone&s;t attention to the teachings which lead <HI>into all truth.</HI> I am &s;atisfied, if the teachings of men were never to thwart the teachings of the holy &s;pirit, many things would fix on the minds of children to be evils which they are now in&s;tructed and per&s;uaded are innocent and commendable.

though anger, pa&s;&s;ion and revenge, are very obvious features of the fir&s;t nature, and &s;hew plainly that there is much to be &s;ubdued in them; yet it will be found, they feel nearly and tenderly for the di&s;tre&s;s of others; their little bo&s;oms beat with compa&s;&s;ion; and if they &s;ee cruelty exerci&s;ed, by one upon ano|ther, they will often, in the be&s;t manner they can, manife&s;t their abhorrence of the cruelty, and di&s;like of the cruel. There is in them that which, as attended to, will re&s;train the violence of nature, and by degrees bind the &s;trong man, and ca&s;t him out, &s;poiling all his goods. It is no &s;ub&s;tantial objection to the di&s;cernment given to children by the holy light which &s;hines in all, either that they evi|dently know but very little, for they have to act in but few and very &s;mall matters, and their di&s;cernment is proportionate; or that the &s;eeds of evil, and propen&s;ities to evil ac|tions, are &s;ome of the fir&s;t things evident in them.</P>
<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible of the volumes of con|trover&s;y about nece&s;&s;ity and free will, fate and choice; but I have no mind now to meddle with any of the common arguments pro or con re&s;pecting them. Men muffle and blind their own under&s;tandings by running into ab&s;tru&s;e and metaphy&s;ical inquiries, wherein they are &s;carce ever the better &s;atisfied for their nice&s;t inve&s;tigations, or keene&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ions.

<P>Adam was as certainly (&s;o it &s;tands in my mind) made able to obey or conform to the divine will, &s;o far as revealed to him, as God is perfect goodne&s;s; and &s;o I am per&s;uaded are all his offspring. I have no more belief that God's revealed will required any thing of our fir&s;t parents, beyond ability to per|form, than I have that God is cruel or per|ver&s;e; and as little do I believe that any infant on earth comes into the world under a moral impo&s;&s;ibility of conformity to the di|vine will, &s;o far as by any means whatever made manife&s;t, which I call revealed. Man is here, upon practical principles: nothing is or can be a law to him, further than it is &s;ome way or other di&s;covered; and that which ultimately a&s;&s;ures and &s;eals it to him as God's law, whatever outward manife&s;tation may be made, is the Holy Spirit, that bears witne&s;s with his &s;pirit, &s;ettling and &s;atisfying his mind &s;ufficiently what is good, and what is evil. And I firmly believe, if children would be as &s;trictly and &s;teadily conformable as they might be, to the divine will, &s;o far as from time to time it is gradually opened and made known, (and there is always power with the opening) they would &s;oon acquire a good degree of dominion, in the &s;trength of divine life, over the &s;trength of evil inclinations in them.</P>

innocent and &s;inle&s;s. This is the too u&s;ual cour&s;e of poor mankind.</P>
<P>Before I was ten years old, the workings of truth grew &s;o powerful in my mind at times, that I took up &s;everal re&s;olutions (or at &s;everal times re&s;olved) to amend my ways, and live a &s;erious and religious life, though I was not one of the mo&s;t vicious of my years; yet enough &s;o to be made very &s;en&s;i|ble of the Lord's controver&s;y with me, on account of the evil of my ways. My mind became exceedingly di&s;quieted, when I went contrary to divine manife&s;tation; though I had not yet a clear &s;en&s;e that it was the very Power and Spirit of God upon me that &s;o condemned and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me for &s;in, and &s;trove to redeem my &s;oul from the bondage of corruption.</P>
<P>I now began to take notice of what I heard read and conver&s;ed of re&s;pecting religion; and among other things&punc; I heard frequent mention in books and conver&s;ation of the Spirit of God; and that good people in for|mer times had it in them; and by it learned the will of God, and were enabled to per|form it. I perceived it was often &s;poken of in both the Old and New Te&s;tament, and many other writings. I under&s;tood that true converts in the&s;e days al&s;o have it. But, like many others, I overlooked its lively checks and calls in my&s;elf; had no idea that I had ever known any thing of it; longed
<PB N="14" REF="032810_0027_0FF529B048B6F8E8">
to be favoured with it; but &s;uppo&s;ed it was &s;ome extraordinary appearance, different far from any thing I ever yet had been ac|quainted with.</P>
<P>Thus the Jews, even while they were ex|pecting Chri&s;t's coming, knew him not when he came. They overlooked and de&s;pi&s;ed his mean and ordinary appearance; thought he was Jo&s;eph's &s;on and born among them, and &s;o rejected, abu&s;ed and finally put him to death. But they were mi&s;taken in his pedigree: his de&s;cent was from heaven; and <HI>God,</HI> not Jo|&s;eph, was his father. Ju&s;t &s;o are thou&s;ands now mi&s;taken, as to the dignity and origin of God's Spirit in them; they think it is of <HI>man,</HI> a part of his nature and being; whereas it is of the very life, power and &s;ub&s;tance of God. Its de&s;cent is as truly from heaven, as was that of the Lord Je&s;us. He came in that <HI>low, mean</HI> and <HI>ordinary</HI> appearance as to outward &s;hew and accommodations, teaching us thereby <HI>not to de&s;pi&s;e the day of &s;mall things,</HI> nor overlook the littlene&s;s of the motions of divine life in our own &s;ouls. And when he compares the kingdom of Heaven, which he expre&s;sly &s;ays is <HI>within,</HI> to outward things, he very in&s;tructively inculcates to us, that the beginnings of it are <HI>&s;mall,</HI> 'a little lea|ven'&mdash;'a little &s;eed'&mdash;'a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed'&mdash;'the lea&s;t of all &s;eeds.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xiii. 31 32.</NOTE>&mdash;This is true in the inward, whatever it be in the outward; for the &s;eed of the kingdom is

<P>I entreat you, as you love your own &s;ouls, and prize an everla&s;ting &s;alvation; I warn you by the dreadful fruits of di&s;obedience, by the pangs, remor&s;e and &s;ufferings of my own &s;oul for &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.

I might have rejoiced and &s;ung, whereas I have had to mourn and weep. For as I grew to fifteen and upwards, in violation to clear inward convictions, in oppo&s;ition to the dictates of the Holy Spirit, I began to run into com|pany, learned to dance and play cards, and took great delight therein. I was often deep|ly condemned, and often &s;trove to &s;tifle the witne&s;s, and per&s;uade my&s;elf there was no harm in any of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>My father &s;ometimes reproved me in tho&s;e days for my conduct; but &s;inning again&s;t divine light and vi&s;itation, hardened me again&s;t his advice. I grew more and more vain, proud, airy and wanton. I put my&s;elf in the way of much evil communication; and it mournfully corrupted good manners.

My ta&s;te for plea&s;ure and amu&s;ement grew keen, my &s;pirits were low and languid when alone, and I ru&s;hed into company and merri|ment for alleviation.</P>
<P>Thus I went on frolicking and gaming, and &s;pending my precious time in vanity. Often at night, or in the night, and &s;ometimes near break of day, I have returned home from my merry meetings grievou&s;ly condemned, di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed and a&s;hamed; wi&s;hing I had not gone into &s;uch company, and re&s;olving to do &s;o no more; but &s;oon my re&s;olutions failed me, and away I went again and again, and thus continued making &s;till greater &s;trides in folly than before.

I have begged for|givene&s;s; implored a&s;&s;i&s;tance; vowed amend|ment; obtained &s;ome relief; and returned home in hope of reformation. But alas, alas.! my re&s;olutions were written as it were in &s;and; the power of habit had en&s;laved me; and al|mo&s;t the next invitation of my a&s;&s;ociates, overcame all my engagements; the eagerne&s;s of de&s;ires for diverti&s;ements and pa&s;time, brake through all the &s;anctions of vows; and violated the &s;olemnity of &s;acred promi&s;es to my God. I ru&s;hed again into tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, as an hor&s;e ru&s;hes into the battle; again and again I took my &s;wing, and drank my fill; and again and again remor&s;e and compunc|tion &s;eized upon me. Adored for ever be the name of the Lord, he for&s;ook me not; but followed me &s;till clo&s;er and clo&s;er, and &s;ound|ed the alarm louder and louder in mine ears. There was in me an immortal part, which his love was towards; the recovery of which, from the thraldom of &s;in and corruption, his
<PB N="19" REF="032810_0032_0FF529A729DCA4F0">
goodne&s;s engaged him to &s;eek by mercy and by judgment; frowns and &s;miles; cha&s;ti&s;e|ments and endearments; and all in love in|expre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Thus dealt he with me. When I turned at his reproofs, he &s;miled upon me, and relieved my &s;oul's anxiety; but when I again revolted, his rod was lifted up in fatherly correction. The &s;till &s;mall voice was uttered in my dwell|ing, as in the cool of the day, when a little retired from noi&s;e and commotion, <HI>Adam, where art thou?</HI> There was no hiding from him, who&s;e penetrating eye no &s;ecret can e&s;cape; and who&s;e aim in reproving was only to &s;ave. He &s;till reproved my wanderings, and pointed out the right way, according to &s;cripture declaration, <Q>thou &s;halt hear a voice behind thee, &s;aying, this is the way, walk in it.</Q> Indeed the way was &s;hewn me; it was often plainly ca&s;t up before me; but I would not walk in it. I knew my Lord's will, but did it not; mine <HI>own,</HI> I &s;till de|lighted in the indulgence of. O! that others may e&s;cape my load of guilt, and may I &s;ay, my bed of hell, or inward tormenting agony, by a timely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the reproofs of in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Sometimes I &s;pent near all the fir&s;t day of the week, when I &s;hould have been at meet|ing, in playing cards, idle, if not di&s;&s;olute con|ver&s;ation, and other vain amu&s;ements; re|turning home at night in condemnation, and

&s;ometimes &s;ighing and crying, and yet thro' all this the Lord pre&s;erved me from hard drinking, though often in the way of tempta|tion and &s;olicitation to it. Swearing I al&s;o mo&s;tly refrained from. Je&s;ting, joking and vain conver&s;ation I went con&s;iderable lengths in; and &s;ometimes joined the foremo&s;t in fil|thy and ob&s;cene di&s;cour&s;es. Then again great &s;hame and &s;elf-abhorrence would overwhelm me; again I vowed, promi&s;ed and renewed my covenant; but all in vain; I had not got deep enough; nor were my covenants made or renewed in the right ability; but too much in my own &s;trength and creaturely re&s;olutions; &s;o they were &s;oon broken. Sometimes I held out a week or two; other times only a day or two. Thus time pa&s;&s;ed on; and, with an increa&s;e of years, I found an increa&s;ing pro|pen&s;ity to wantonne&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation. But ble&s;&s;ed be the God of my &s;alvation, he pro|portionately increa&s;ed my &s;en&s;e of guilt and condemnation.</P>
<P>I had &s;ea&s;ons of very &s;erious con&s;ideration upon religion. What in&s;tructions I had out|wardly received, were mo&s;tly in the way of Friends; but when I came near to man's e&s;tate, falling in company with &s;ome of the Bapti&s;t &s;ociety, I was drawn to attend their meetings in Providence. Friends meetings were oftener held in &s;ilence than &s;uited my itching ear. I loved to hear words, began to grow inqui&s;itive, and to &s;earch pretty deeply into doctrines and tenets of religion; and the
<PB N="21" REF="032810_0034_0FF529C9476DCF48">
Bapti&s;t preachers filled my ears with words, and my head with arguments and di&s;tinctions; but my heart was little or not at all improved by them. I almo&s;t for&s;ook the meetings of Friends, except yearly meetings, and meet|ings appointed by travellers in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel. But when I went to the&s;e, O! how livingly I &s;till remember the heavenly and heart-tendering impre&s;&s;ions I &s;ometimes received under the animating te&s;timonies de|livered in the life of the go&s;pel. Here my <HI>heart</HI> was helped, though my <HI>head</HI> was le&s;s amu&s;ed than among the Bapti&s;ts: however, as I knew not clearly what cau&s;ed the differ|ence; as Friends meetings remained &s;till often &s;ilent; and as I &s;till wi&s;hed the gratification of argumentative, &s;y&s;tematic di&s;cour&s;es; I &s;till pretty diligently attended the Bapti&s;t meeting; and, in my mo&s;t religious &s;ea&s;ons, I began to think of being baptized in water. For the head-work &s;o far outrun the heart-work, during my attendance of the&s;e meet|ings, that I became convinced in &s;peculation, that that outward performance was an ordi|nance of Chri&s;t; though I have &s;ince &s;een, that it never was ordained by Je&s;us; but was a forerunning, preparatory and decrea&s;ing in&s;titution, and has long &s;ince done its office, and cea&s;ed in the church in point of obliga|tion; and that there is now to the true church but one Lord, one faith, and one bapti&s;m, that of the Holy Gho&s;t, which only can purify and make clean the in&s;ide. Oh! my heart, my very &s;oul is fully &s;atisfied in this matter;
<PB N="22" REF="032810_0035_0FF52A00F8DF0178">
having felt the living efficacy of this one &s;av|ing bapti&s;m, and known its full &s;ufficiency, without any other.</P>
<P>What fir&s;t turned my mind to believe the outward a chri&s;tian ordinance was this one argument of the Bapti&s;ts&mdash;<Q>Chri&s;t command|ed his di&s;ciples to baptize: No man can baptize with the Holy Gho&s;t; therefore the bapti&s;m he commanded was not that of the Holy Gho&s;t, but that of water.</Q> This then appeared to me conclu&s;ive, and unan&s;werable. But it was my ignorance of that baptizing power which attends all true go&s;pel mini&s;try, that made me a&s;&s;ent to this fal&s;e po&s;ition, 'no man can baptize with the Holy Gho&s;t.' Man him&s;elf, in his own mere ability, I know can|not; but I al&s;o know, that of him&s;elf he can|not preach the go&s;pel. This a&s;&s;ertion, no man can preach the go&s;pel, is ju&s;t as true as that 'no man can baptize with the Holy Gho&s;t.' As man merely, he can do nothing at all of either; but it &s;till &s;tands true, man can, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, do both. The real go&s;pel was never yet preached, but 'with the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ent down from heaven.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 12.</NOTE> Thus the apo&s;tles preached it, and thus alone it is &s;till preached&mdash;and &s;o preaching it, it was a baptizing mini&s;try. As they &s;pake, the Holy Gho&s;t fell on them that heard them; that is, where faith wrought in the hearts of the hear|ers, and the living eternal word preached, through the power of the Holy Gho&s;t, was
<PB N="23" REF="032810_0036_0FF529A1E5D78FA0">
mixed with faith in them that heard it; the Holy Gho&s;t fell on them, baptizing them into a living &s;oul-&s;aving &s;en&s;e of the 'power of God to &s;alvation,'<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 16.</NOTE> which is the true life of the go&s;pel. Thus the apo&s;tles fulfilled the commi&s;&s;ion. They taught baptizingly. The commi&s;&s;ion is not 'teach, and then baptize,' as two &s;eparate acts. It is 'teach, baptizing,' &mdash;and tho&s;e who livingly witne&s;s the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> the power of God to &s;alvation, preached unto them, they feel it, and receive it in, and only in <Q>the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ent down from heaven, they are taught baptizingly, in the demon|&s;tration of the &s;pirit and of power.</Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 4.</NOTE> And no preaching has a whit more of the go&s;pel in it, than it has of the Holy Gho&s;t, the alone true baptizing power. I don't marvel that the letter-learned teachers of our day who run un|&s;ent, who are <HI>always ready,</HI> are ignorant that a true go&s;pel mini&s;ter is clothed with baptizing authority from on high.&mdash;I may not now go much further into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject of bapti&s;m, though I &s;carce know how to di&s;|mi&s;s it, &s;o many things occur in evidence that there is and can be but <HI>one</HI> in the go&s;pel, and that this is and mu&s;t be &s;piritual.</P>
<P>I had not yet fully given up to the motions of divine life in my own heart. My mind was too much turned outward; and the preaching of tho&s;e I &s;ometimes went to hear, who preached in their own time, had a powerful tendency to keep it outward. In this &s;tate of
<PB N="24" REF="032810_0037_0FF52B23F5CCB098">
outward attention and inquiry, I found no|thing that could give me power over &s;in and corruption; but notwith&s;tanding all my &s;eri|ous thoughtfulne&s;s, and frequent and ardent de&s;ires to become truly religious, I &s;till, once in a while, brake loo&s;e, and launched forth into as great degrees of vanity and wickedne&s;s as ever: and then again a turn of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s would come over me. One time under deep exerci&s;e, after rea&s;oning and he&s;i|tating great part of a day, whether I had be&s;t give up with full purpo&s;e of heart, to lead a religious life or not; at length I gave up, and entered once more into &s;olemn covenant, to &s;erve God, and deny my&s;elf, according to the be&s;t of my under&s;tanding. Almo&s;t as &s;oon as I had thus given up, and come to this good conclu&s;ion, in &s;tepped the grand adver&s;ary, and blundered and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed my mind ex|ceedingly with the doctrine of prede&s;tination; powerfully in&s;inuating that a certain number were infallibly ordained to eternal &s;alvation, the re&s;t to inevitable de&s;truction; and that not all the religious exerci&s;es of my mind could po&s;&s;ibly make any alteration in my final de&s;|tination and allotment. If God had damned me from all eternity, I mu&s;t be damned for ever; if he had cho&s;en me to eternal &s;alva|tion, I might &s;et my heart at re&s;t, and live ju&s;t &s;uch a life as would mo&s;t gratify my natural inclinations; for what advantage could there be in religion, and &s;elf-denial, if an eternal, unalterable decree &s;ecured my final end. I felt willing to hope I was a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el; and
<PB N="25" REF="032810_0038_0FF52A0295898108">
for a &s;hort time the&s;e ideas &s;o crouded into my mind, that I was even ready to conclude a God all goodne&s;s had doomed the far greater part of mankind to never-ending mi&s;ery, with|out any provocation on their part. I now view the doctrine of unconditional election to eternal life, and reprobation to eternal de|&s;truction, with abhorrence. I almo&s;t marvel, that under a cloud of darkne&s;s, my rational faculties could ever be &s;o impo&s;ed upon, as to a&s;&s;ent to &s;o erroneous a &s;entiment. I know of no doctrine in the world that more &s;hock|ingly reflects on the character of the Deity.</P>
<P>I did not indeed &s;o drink down this fal&s;e doctrine as to relinqui&s;h my purpo&s;e of amend|ment all at once; I held out a few weeks; when, mournful to relate, the influence of young company, and my vehement de&s;ires for creaturely indulgence, through the tole|rating influence of the afore&s;aid in&s;inuations, brake through all my mo&s;t &s;olemn engage|ments, threw down the walls and fortifica|tions, and expo&s;ed me an ea&s;y prey to the grand enemy of my &s;oul's &s;alvation. Again I took my &s;wing in vanity, amu&s;ements and di&s;&s;ipation. This, however, was but a &s;hort race. The Lord, in loving kindne&s;s, followed me with his judgments, inwardly revealed again&s;t &s;in. The prince of darkne&s;s al&s;o fol|lowed me, with temptation upon temptation to evil; and with various &s;ubtil in&s;inuations, and dark notions to rid me of all fear, re|&s;traint or tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience.

notwith&s;tanding all I had felt of the power of God upon me, in reproof for &s;in, and invita|tion to holine&s;s; yea, though I had had &s;ome true reli&s;h of divine good, the holy witne&s;s became &s;o &s;tifled, that I began to conclude there was <HI>no God;</HI> that all things came by chance, by nature, by the fortuitous jumble and concour&s;e of atoms, without any de&s;ign|ing cau&s;e, or intelligent arrangement; that it was idle, chimerical and delu&s;ive, to think of &s;erving or fearing a being who had no exi&s;t|ence but in imagination.&mdash;Here let it be well con&s;idered what a powerful influence the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of one fal&s;e doctrine, and the violation of divine manife&s;tation and conviction, has in paving the way for other fal&s;e doctrines.

&s;oul; but that, whenever this is received and in all things thoroughly &s;ubmitted to, a tho|rough reconciliation takes place.</P>
<P>Some may think this doctrine robs Chri&s;t of the honour of our redemption and recon|ciliation; but I apprehend none can think &s;o who under&s;tand the doctrine of &s;alvation by Je&s;us. It was through the eternal Spirit, this very Spirit that vi&s;its and &s;trives with all, that Chri&s;t offered up that prepared body. It is through, and only through, the influence of the &s;ame Holy Spirit, that any &s;oul was ever converted to God, or &s;avingly benefited by the redemption that is in Je&s;us. Whatever way, O &s;oul, or by whatever means thou art be|nefited in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, it is by this Holy Spirit, that is the immediate operative power and principle within thee.</P>
<P>Having thus at length become livingly convinced that it was nothing &s;hort of the eternal Power and Spirit of God that &s;o for|cibly wrought in me, in order for my deli|verance from the power of darkne&s;s and &s;e|duction, I gave up to the holy requirings of God, as inwardly made known to me&mdash;and clearly known were many things thus made. Nothing el&s;e could ever &s;o have opened my mind, and made known my duty to me. The Scriptures, other good books, religious conver&s;ation, contemplation upon the works of creation and providence; all the&s;e are very good means of information; but none

of them, nor even all of them, without the Holy Spirit's &s;ealing operation and evidence upon the mind, can ever make a man &s;ure of his duty to God in any one thing. He may rea&s;on, and &s;et up many rules, mea&s;ures and &s;tandards of duty and morality; but certainly he never will arrive thereat, without the help of that which in it&s;elf is certain.

<P>But to proceed:&mdash;I gave up very fully to &s;erve the Lord in the way of his leadings; I for&s;ook rude and vicious company, with|drew into retirement, attended the meetings of Friends, and often &s;ought the Lord, and waited upon him, in &s;olemn, reverential &s;i|lence alone, for his coun&s;el, direction and pre&s;ervation; and he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to point out and ca&s;t up the way for me, one thing after another, with &s;ufficiency of clear|ne&s;s. Fir&s;t, he &s;hewed me <HI>negatively,</HI> what I ought not to do, in various particulars, breaking me off from my vicious practices and a&s;&s;ociations. This was <HI>for&s;aking evil.</HI> And
<PB N="32" REF="032810_0045_0FF52AC481A87FE0">
then he taught and enjoined me the practice of &s;everal things <HI>po&s;itively,</HI> wherein he engaged me to choo&s;e and cleave unto that which is good. I &s;aw clearly it was his will, and my indi&s;pen&s;ible duty reverently to a&s;&s;emble for divine wor&s;hip, and therein to <HI>wait</HI> upon him, draw inwardly near unto him, and, ac|cording to the apo&s;tle's language, <HI>feel after him,</HI> in order to find and enjoy him.

He al&s;o &s;hewed me, that religion was an internal life in the &s;oul; that great attention, &s;incerity and punctuality was nece&s;&s;ary to the growth and pro&s;perity of it: that I mu&s;t not be con|tent with attending meetings, and &s;itting in &s;ilence, though ever &s;o reverently and pro|perly; I mu&s;t live continually in an inward watchfulne&s;s and dedication of heart; watch all my thoughts, words and actions, and know all brought to judgment; and allow nothing to pa&s;s unexamined, nor willingly unapproved: that I mu&s;t ob&s;erve the mo&s;t upright hone&s;ty and &s;incerity in my dealings among men as in the pre&s;ence of God. He taught me that men generally rely too much on external performances; and thus guard|ing my mind again&s;t thinking too much of any thing outward.

I thought if my right hand would excu&s;e my compliance, I would gladly &s;acrifice it, or

And yet this flow of divine con&s;olation la&s;ted not long at this time; for though I gave up to whatever the Lord required of me, yet as I had &s;o long and &s;o &s;tubbornly rebelled again&s;t him, he &s;aw meet, in his infinite wi&s;|dom, &s;oon to hide his face from me again, and clo&s;e me up in almo&s;t utter darkne&s;s, which rendered my days truly tedious, and my nights weari&s;ome to my &s;oul. I was fully convinced that God was to be known inwardly in power and great glory, by tho&s;e who obey him, and wait upon him. My heart was inflamed with love towards him. I had &s;een a little of his comeline&s;s&mdash;He had become the beloved of my &s;oul, the chiefe&s;t among ten thou&s;ands; therefore I often retir|ed alone and in profound reverential &s;ilence, &s;ought after him, and pre&s;&s;ingly &s;olicited a nearer acquaintance with him. But he know|ing what was be&s;t for me, graciou&s;ly hid his pre&s;ence from me. And though this was a painful &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, yet I could not be ea&s;y to give over &s;eeking him; I &s;till continued my ardent &s;ilent approaches, or waitings. I wait|ed indeed, with all the reverence, humility, and &s;olicitude that my &s;oul was capable of; but all &s;eemed in vain. Oh! the mourning and lamentation, the di&s;tre&s;s and bitter weep|ing, that almo&s;t continually overwhelmed me for &s;everal months together, for the want

<P>During a great part of the foregoing exer|ci&s;es, I had frequent openings, and lively pro|&s;pects re&s;pecting the chri&s;tian warfare, and
<PB N="44" REF="032810_0057_0FF52AC8CC045310">
the my&s;teries of the kingdom of heaven. I of|ten believed, in the openings of divine light, that, if I &s;tood faithful, it would be required of me to declare to others what the Lord had done for me, and given me an under&s;tanding of, and to entreat my fellow-creatures to &s;eek an habitation in that kingdom that cannot be &s;haken or fade away.&mdash;This concern began now to grow upon me con&s;iderably, even to that degree, that I felt at times in meetings a living engagement to communicate &s;ome|what to the people; but, fearing I &s;hould begin in that great work before the right time, I kept back; and even divers times, when I was almo&s;t ready to &s;tand up, I have con|cluded I would keep &s;ilence this once more; con&s;idering within my&s;elf, that if my &s;o doing &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ing to the Lord, he would manife&s;t his di&s;plea&s;ure to me; but if I &s;hould pre&s;ume to &s;peak a word in his name, and it &s;hould prove to be without his holy requir|ings, or too &s;oon, I &s;hould not only di&s;plea&s;e him, but al&s;o burden his people; and per|haps get into and become entangled in a way of &s;peaking from too &s;mall motions or im|pre&s;&s;ions felt, or mournfully mi&s;take the &s;parks of my own kindling for divine impre&s;|&s;ions; which might, in con&s;equence of my giving way thereunto, be &s;uffered to increa&s;e upon me to my great lo&s;s in the &s;ub&s;tantial and divine life, if not to my utter ruin. In this guarded frame of mind I pa&s;&s;ed on for &s;ome time, often &s;eeking to the Lord for coun&s;el and direction in this and other con|cerns
<PB N="45" REF="032810_0058_0FF52996E6C3E788">
of importance. And though I believe I might have publickly borne te&s;timony in the name, power and approbation of the Lord, rather &s;ooner than I did; yet as I was not ob&s;tinately, but carefully backward, I &s;eldom felt much condemnation for withholding: however, I did a few times find &s;ome real unea&s;ine&s;s on that account.&mdash;But he who laid the concern upon me, well knowing the integrity of my heart, and that I was bent faithfully to &s;erve him, without going too fa&s;t, or yet tarrying behind my guide, dealt gra|ciou&s;ly with me, pa&s;&s;ed by my little withhold|ings, favoured with fre&s;h and increa&s;ing in|comes of his love, and from time to time, ca&s;t up my way with &s;till greater clearne&s;s; and at length in a manner &s;o clear, and con|firming, as era&s;ed doubt and he&s;itation from my mind. In the fre&s;h authority whereof I uttered a few words in our meeting at Provi|dence, on the fir&s;t day of the week, and 10th of the 4th month 1774, to my own and I believe my friends &s;atisfaction.

<P>After &s;ome time of heavenly rejoicing, I began again to be tried with various exerci&s;es and conflicts of mind, though &s;till frequently favoured with the flowings of divine love, in a very comfortable and &s;oul-&s;atisfying man|ner. At divers times I had lively impre&s;&s;ions

to &s;ay a few words more, in publick te&s;timo|ny; but &s;till waited to be well a&s;&s;ured.

The bea&s;ts, allowed in &s;acri|fice, were to chew the cud and divide the hoof. Chewing the cud is a deliberate act: they chew and &s;wallow, and chew and &s;wal|low again. The divi&s;ion of the hoof being on the <HI>&s;tepping</HI> member, &s;hews the danger of taking a &s;ingle &s;tep in divine &s;ervices, without a clear divi&s;ion of things, and the way ca&s;t up in the mind.&mdash;As I thus waited for clear|ne&s;s, not being by once &s;ucceeding encourag|ed to run too fa&s;t, I was favoured to know the fire of the Lord rightly kindled upon his altar; and to witne&s;s an offering of his own preparing. And I am well a&s;&s;ured that &s;uch, and &s;uch only are the offerings which will find acceptance with him. He never will reject the&s;e, any more than accept tho&s;e of human obtruding.</P>
<P>My &s;econd publick appearance in the mini&s;try was at the lower meeting-hou&s;e in Smithfield, the 19th of the 10th month 1774, when I found a living concern to encourage a careful engagement before the Lord, out of meetings; and to pre&s;s it upon Friends to

draw nigh unto him from day to day, that &s;trength may be renewed, and the divine &s;a|vour of life retained, le&s;t we lo&s;e the living &s;en&s;e of what we often graciou&s;ly enjoy in our religious meetings. Life, divine life, attended me in this little te&s;timony, as in the former. And after meeting I enjoyed the &s;weet influ|ence of him who is the God of my &s;alvation, in a degree that was greatly to my confirmation and encouragement. After this I &s;till conti|nued &s;eeking unto and waiting upon God for coun&s;el and direction; in which frame of mind I was favoured to renew and increa&s;e a living acquaintance with him; and witne&s;&s;ed fre&s;h in|&s;truction to my mind. I appeared but &s;eldom in publick te&s;timony, and mo&s;tly in a few words at a time, and yet I have &s;ome few times been made &s;en&s;ible of &s;aying too much; and for which I have felt more pain of mind than I have often felt, if ever, for withholding.

<P>AT this time I kept a &s;chool for Friends children in the town of Providence; and having for &s;everal years pa&s;t believed at times, that it might be be&s;t to pre&s;erve &s;ome account of my pilgrimage through the wil|derne&s;s of this world, I now began a more regular and con&s;tant journal of my exerci&s;es, and the Lord's gracious dealings with me, than I had heretofore pre&s;erved. I had before made a few minutes of &s;ome remarkable oc|currences, which (together with what was fre&s;h in my memory, and &s;o recorded there as not likely &s;oon if ever to be obliterated) enabled me to write the foregoing account; and thus to bring it forward to this time.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t day of the week, the 1&s;t of the 1&s;t month 1775, I fell and received a &s;mall wound which was attended with con&s;iderable &s;orene&s;s and pain; and next day having in addition to this a turn of the nervous or &s;ick head-ach, I was confined to the hou&s;e: and hope the&s;e light afflictions were not wholly

<P>1775. About the&s;e days I went through great di&s;couragements and heavy exerci&s;es; but was mo&s;tly enabled to hope and believe it was all for my good, and would tend, if rightly endured, to my furtherance and en|largement in divine things; and, ble&s;&s;ed be the name of him who led and &s;upported me through them; he did indeed ari&s;e for my help and con&s;olation, even with healing in his wings; and that too, when I was almo&s;t ready to faint, and de&s;pair of his help; which made me hope I &s;hould tru&s;t in him, and rely upon him, for the future; even in and through all trying di&s;pen&s;ations. Indeed it is ea&s;y to hope and believe we &s;hall tru&s;t in the Lord, when he &s;hines upon us, and &s;heds abroad his love in our hearts, making us livingly to joy and rejoice in his pre&s;ence, which was now graciou&s;ly my happy experi|ence; but alas! when we have again and again to pa&s;s through the valley and &s;hadow of death, it is not &s;o ea&s;y to &s;tand firm, <HI>keep the faith,</HI> and tru&s;t in God.</P>
<P>My exerci&s;ed &s;oul has had large experience

of the&s;e heights and depths; and knows that nothing but divine power can uphold us in times of deep probation which we mu&s;t pa&s;s through in our travels towards the land of re&s;t. And O! that none may give out in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons, or faint in their minds; it is no new thing; it is the beaten path, and all the Lord's ran&s;omed mu&s;t become acquainted with it, and travel in it, not taking their flight in the winter; and as they thus &s;tand firm, they will joyfully witne&s;s, in the Lord's time, the winter to be over, the &s;ummer to advance, the time of the &s;inging of birds to be come, and the voice of the turtle to be heard in their land. Oh! the pangs and &s;ufferings through which &s;ome have waited again and again for the return of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed enjoyments, the&s;e mo|ments of refre&s;hment from the pre&s;ence of the Lord; but none have ever rightly waited on the Lord in vain. Therefore tru&s;t in him, O my &s;oul for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everla&s;ting &s;trength.</P>
<P>Fourth-day 25th, I attended our monthly meeting at Smithfield, upper meeting-hou&s;e; found &s;ome dear friends &s;ympathized with me in my deep probations: and was particularly comforted by a letter from a dearly beloved friend, written in a manner well &s;uited to a&s;&s;i&s;t and encourage my drooping mind&mdash; May I ever walk worthy the remembrance, &s;ympathy and prayers of my friends.</P>
<P>Fifth-day, 2d of 2d month. In time of

&s;ilence and retirement in family devotion, wherein we were engaged to wait upon the Lord, for the renewal of &s;trength toge|ther, my mind was livingly opened into a fre&s;h and humbling &s;en&s;e of the un&s;peakable love and goodne&s;s of God to poor, frail, finite man in ancient days&mdash;particularly I was bowed in con&s;ideration of his wonderful deal|ings with Noah; and how he was with him in the ark; and how he taught him to pre|pare it for his own and family's pre&s;ervation: how he was with Abraham when he left his father's hou&s;e at his command, and went forth not knowing whither he was to go: al&s;o how he was with I&s;rael in Egypt, through the Red &s;ea, the wilderne&s;s, and Jordan; with David, when he fled from Saul, being hunted as a partridge upon the mountains; with Jo|nah, in the whale's belly; with Daniel, in the lion's den; and the three children, in the fiery furnace; with his own well beloved &s;on, in the great trials and temptations which he was led through in the wilderne&s;s and among men: al&s;o how he was with the apo&s;|tles, and &s;upported them when men ro&s;e up again&s;t them; and through all their perils by &s;ea and land, and by and among fal&s;e brethren. What &s;hall I &s;ay? he hath ever been a &s;anctuary and &s;afe hiding place for the righteous in all ages, and remains to be &s;o &s;till; and as truly and powerfully &s;o now as ever.&mdash;And as my mind was thus led and opened, earne&s;t breathings were begotten in me, that we of the pre&s;ent generation, who
<PB N="52" REF="032810_0065_0FF52A43C0C49050">
have known his loving kindne&s;s, may walk worthy of the continuance thereof, and never di&s;tru&s;t his care and providence; a&s;&s;uredly believing, that he who hath been with us in &s;ix troubles will not leave us in the &s;eventh, if we firmly tru&s;t in, and &s;teadfa&s;tly follow him. But if we &s;hould draw back, his &s;oul would then have no plea&s;ure in us.&mdash;Oh! therefore, &s;aith my &s;oul, that we may be vigi|lant, knowing that our adver&s;ary the devil, like a roaring lion, goes about continually, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth month I attended our yearly meeting on Rhode-I&s;land. John Hunt and Nicholas Waln from Philadelphia, and Wil|liam Jones and Benjamin Sweat from New-Jer&s;ey, attended &s;aid meeting&mdash;It held a num|ber of days, the &s;everal &s;ittings thereof being times of divine favour; the &s;ouls of &s;ome painful travellers Zion-ward were greatly en|couraged and rejoiced in the Lord. Dear John Hunt was livingly opened in go&s;pel love and authority divers times among us in the&s;e meetings.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t-day the 18th of 6th month, a pa|per was &s;ent from our deputy-governor to the Friends of our meeting, reque&s;ting that &s;uch as had &s;mall arms would produce them at the court-hou&s;e next day, in order that the guns in the government might be known, and an account thereof &s;ent to the continental congre&s;s. After mature con&s;ideration, a pa|per
<PB N="53" REF="032810_0066_0FF52AC666C28BE0">
was &s;igned by &s;uch male members of our &s;ociety as lived within the town, in an&s;wer to &s;aid reque&s;t, informing that our religious principles and con&s;cientious per&s;ua&s;ion did not admit of a compliance. This was car|ried to the deputy governor, who received it kindly, and &s;eemed &s;atisfied, &s;aying he believ|ed liberty of con&s;cience was the natural right of all mankind. Thus the Lord made way for us, ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name for ever.</P>
<P>Much clo&s;e exerci&s;e of mind I had for a con|&s;iderable length of time, on account of &s;ome particular &s;cruples which from time to time revived with weight, and &s;o pre&s;&s;ingly accom|panied me, that I could not get rid of them. It being a time of war, and preparations for war between Great-Britain and America, and the rulers of America having made a paper currency profe&s;&s;edly for the &s;pecial purpo&s;e of promoting or maintaining &s;aid war; and it be|ing expected that Friends would be tried by requi&s;itions for taxes, principally for the &s;up|port of war; I was greatly exerci&s;ed in &s;pirit, both on the account of taking and pa&s;&s;ing &s;aid money, and in regard to the payment of &s;uch taxes, neither of which felt ea&s;y to my mind. I believed a time would come when chri&s;tians would not &s;o far contribute to the encourage|ment and &s;upport of war and fightings as voluntarily to pay taxes that were mainly, or even in con&s;iderable proportion, for defraying the expen&s;es thereof; and it was al&s;o impre&s;&s;ed upon my mind, that if I took and pa&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="54" REF="032810_0067_0FF52A53D61D7408">
money that I knew was made on purpo&s;e to uphold war, I &s;hould not bear a te&s;timony again&s;t war, that, for me as an individual, would be a faithful one. I knew the people's minds were in a rage again&s;t &s;uch as, from any motive whatever, &s;aid or acted any thing tending to di&s;countenance the war. I was &s;en&s;ible that refu&s;ing to pay the taxes, or to take the currency, would immediately be con|&s;trued as a pointed oppo&s;ition to the pre&s;ent war in particular, as even our refu&s;ing to bear arms was, notwith&s;tanding our long and well known te&s;timony again&s;t it. I had abundant rea&s;on to expect great cen&s;ure and &s;ome &s;uf|fering in con&s;equence of my faithfulne&s;s, if I &s;hould &s;tand faithful in the&s;e things, though I knew that my &s;cruples were unconnected with any party con&s;iderations, and uninflu|enced by any motives but &s;uch as re&s;pect the propriety of a truly chri&s;tian conduct in re|gard to war at large. I had no de&s;ire to pro|mote the oppo&s;ition to Great-Britain; neither had I any de&s;ire on the other hand to promote the mea&s;ures or &s;ucce&s;s of Great-Britain. I believed it my bu&s;ine&s;s not to meddle with any thing from &s;uch views; but to let the pot&s;herds of the earth alone in their &s;miting one again&s;t another: but I wi&s;hed to be clear in the &s;ight of God, and to do all that he might require of me towards the more full introduction and coming of his peaceable kingdom and government on earth. I found many well concerned brethren, who &s;eemed to have little or nothing of the&s;e &s;cruples;
<PB N="55" REF="032810_0068_0FF52A699CC470E0">
and &s;ome others who were like-minded with me herein. Under all the&s;e con&s;iderations the times looked &s;omewhat gloomy; and at &s;ea&s;ons great di&s;couragement &s;pread over my mind. But after &s;ome &s;trugglings, and a length of clo&s;e exerci&s;e attended with much inward looking to the Lord for direction and &s;upport, I was enabled to ca&s;t my care upon him, and to ri&s;k my&s;elf and my all in his &s;er|vice, come whatever might come, or &s;uffer whatever I might &s;uffer, in con&s;equence there|of. I was well aware of many arguments and objections again&s;t attending to &s;uch &s;cruples; and &s;ome &s;eemingly very plau&s;ible ones from &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, e&s;pecially re&s;pect|ing taxes; but I believed I &s;aw them all to ari&s;e from a want of clear under&s;tanding re&s;|pecting the true meaning of &s;aid pa&s;&s;ages; and I knew I had no wordly intere&s;t, ea&s;e or honour, to promote by an hone&s;t attention to what I believed were the reproofs and con|victions of divine in&s;truction. I well knew, not only by reading, but experimentally, that <Q>He that doubteth is damned (condemned) if he eat;</Q> and that what is contrary to faith and conviction is &s;in; therefore I cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer in this world than incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of him from whom cometh all my con&s;olation and ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>In the 9th month this year 1776, in com|pany with my dear friend Mo&s;es Farnum, I vi&s;ited Friends at Richmond, in New-Hamp|&s;hire government, a branch of our monthly
<PB N="56" REF="032810_0069_0FF52A574005D818">
meeting. We were twice at their meeting, and vi&s;ited I believe all their families. It was an exerci&s;ing time to me; and I was almo&s;t wholly &s;ilent both in meetings and families; and even much re&s;trained from conver&s;ation. Yet I had a hope that all was working toge|ther for my good; and I endured my trials with a degree of patience, though I often groaned inwardly for deliverance: however the Lord brought me through all, and gave me to rejoice in his &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Fifth of tenth month. Having for nearly a year declined taking the paper currency, agreeably to the &s;ecret per&s;ua&s;ion which I had of my duty therein, as before mention|ed: I have now the &s;atisfaction of compar|ing the different rewards of obedience and di&s;obedience; for though, from the very fir&s;t circulation of &s;aid money, I felt unea&s;y in taking it; yet fears and rea&s;onings of one kind or another prevailed on me to take it for a &s;ea&s;on; and then it became harder to refu&s;e it than it would probably have been at fir&s;t: but growing more unea&s;y and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed about it, at length I refu&s;ed it alto|gether, &s;ince which I have felt great peace and &s;atisfaction of mind therein; which has in a very confirming manner been increa&s;|ing from time to time, the longer I have refu&s;ed it: and although I get almo&s;t no money of any kind, little other being in cir|culation, yet I had much rather live and de|pend on Divine Providence, for a daily &s;up|ply,
<PB N="57" REF="032810_0070_0FF52A6B3563D8C0">
than to increa&s;e in the mammon of this world's goods, by any ways or means incon|&s;i&s;tent with the holy will of my heavenly Father&mdash;and the prayer of my &s;oul to him is, that I and all his children may be pre&s;erved faithful to him in all his requirings, and out of that love of things here below which ali|enates from the true love of and communion with him.</P>
<P>In the 11th month this year I vi&s;ited, in company with a Friend of our monthly meet|ing, the meetings and many of the families of Friends on Rhode-I&s;land, and had much &s;atisfaction therein; for though I had hard work in &s;ome families, and pa&s;&s;ed through &s;ome clo&s;e exerci&s;es, yet the Lord was with me and bore me up through all, opening my way in the &s;pring of divine life, and furni&s;h|ing with &s;uitable matter for communication, to the relief and con&s;olation of my own mind, and I hope to the benefit and comfort of others. And it was remarkable to me, that in a very &s;hort time, indeed not many days after I had thus di&s;charged my duty, and paid this legacy of love to my dear friends on this i&s;land, the king's troops took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion there|of, whereby the communication was greatly ob&s;tructed for a con&s;iderable length of time between Friends there and the main, that, had I not given up to perform this &s;mall &s;er|vice ju&s;t as I did, and when the weight of it was livingly upon me, it is probable I might never have done it at all, or not to much &s;a|tisfaction.
<PB N="58" REF="032810_0071_0FF52A58EE4F7BE8">
&mdash;A &s;en&s;e of the Lord's goodne&s;s in enabling me to go in the right time, and to find relief and &s;atisfaction in the vi&s;it, bow|ed my mind and rai&s;ed de&s;ires therein, that I might ever live like one who knows him&s;elf to be but a pilgrim on the earth, and that God alone can &s;u&s;tain him. Amen.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day, 8th of twelfth month. Divers Friends of our meeting at Providence became exerci&s;ed in regard to a commotion that was prevailing among the inhabitants. It was &s;aid, and I &s;uppo&s;e was true, that a Briti&s;h fleet with troops had been &s;een not far from Rhode-I&s;land; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed they were aiming to come into New-Port harbour, and probably up the river to this town. This greatly &s;urpri&s;ed many of the inhabitants.&mdash; Many moved their goods, and &s;ome their fa|milies out of town, in great ha&s;te and preci|pitancy. The town &s;eemed in an uproar; carts rattling, and teams driving all night; and, among others, a few Friends in this &s;udden con&s;ternation were induced to move &s;ome of their effects al&s;o, and a &s;mall matter was done at moving their families: and this be|ing, in the view of &s;ome concerned Friends, a weighty, &s;erious matter, a conference was held after the afternoon meeting upon the occa|&s;ion, &s;ome Friends of other meetings al&s;o be|ing pre&s;ent, and though nothing cen&s;orious or uncharitable appeared in any re&s;pecting the conduct of any, yet it was advi&s;ed that Friends &s;hould be very careful to act in mode|ration,
<PB N="59" REF="032810_0072_0FF52AB34ED418C8">
and not in the hurry, but wait for clear|ne&s;s, and for ability to act becoming our holy profe&s;&s;ion. Next day this advice was further inculcated by the meeting for &s;ufferings which &s;at in town, and which, after &s;olid con&s;idera|tion, advi&s;ed that Friends keep &s;till and quiet, and do no more, unle&s;s, upon deep and &s;olid con&s;ideration, the way &s;hould be clearly &s;een for any one to move. It was al&s;o thought advi&s;able for Friends in all things to conduct &s;o as not to increa&s;e the commotion and in|timidation which was already too prevalent among the people. This advice was very &s;avoury to &s;ome of our minds, who&s;e exerci&s;e was great on this occa&s;ion; and who&s;e tra|vail of &s;oul was, that Friends might be pre|&s;erved in the &s;tability of the unchangeable truth.</P>
<P>Fifth-day, 12th of 12th month. My mind was impre&s;&s;ed &s;o deeply with a lively &s;en&s;e of the excellency and nece&s;&s;ity of true chri&s;tian charity, that I had to &s;peak of it in our meet|ing in the con&s;trainings of the Father's love, labouring to encourage Friends to cultivate this excellent virtue, in their own minds and in each other.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day, 5th of 1&s;t month 1777. For the want of clo&s;e attention to the word of divine life in my own &s;oul, I made a blunder in my publick te&s;timony, which greatly humbled me, and made me very careful and watchful afterwards. O! it is good to tru&s;t in the
<PB N="60" REF="032810_0073_0FF52AF405EBD2C8">
Lord with all our hearts, not leaning to our own under&s;tandings. It was relying too much on my own under&s;tanding and memory which brought this great anxiety upon me. And I record it for future caution, mean-while be|&s;eeching God Almighty to pre&s;erve me, and all his true go&s;pel mini&s;ters in the right line of &s;afety and divine qualification, which is in and with the opening of the Spirit, and with the under&s;tanding al&s;o.</P>
<P>Fifth-day, 3d of 4th month. After a few words which I became concerned to expre&s;s in our week-day meeting, my mind was &s;o clothed with the &s;pirit of prayer and &s;uppli|cation, that I was prevailed upon to kneel down and publickly addre&s;s the throne of grace. This was the fir&s;t time I ever appear|ed in vocal publick &s;upplication; and it was truly much in the cro&s;s, as al&s;o in great fear and reverence. It was indeed to me an aw|ful thing publickly to call on the name of the Lord, and I have been many times &s;orely grieved at the light, ea&s;y and unfeeling man|ner in which many do it. A few weeks after this, to wit, the 25th of the 4th month, in writing a little piece on a &s;pecial occa&s;ion, after particularly and affectionately mention|ing the tender feelings and emotions of my heart towards &s;everal particular friends and acquaintances, my &s;oul &s;eemed overwhelmed with love and almo&s;t unutterable good-will to the people of the Lord, wherever &s;catter|ed, the world over; in the fre&s;h flowings
<PB N="61" REF="032810_0074_0FF52A7828772950">
whereof I enlarged nearly as follows: <Q>But above all, O Sion, thou city of the living God! what &s;hall I &s;ay to thee! all that is alive within me is moved at thy being now brought into my remembrance! how &s;hall I expre&s;s the overflowings of that love I now feel for thee; or that ardently travailing ex|erci&s;e, which in the rolling of tender bowels engages my &s;oul for thy everla&s;ting welfare! May the Lord of ho&s;ts encamp round about thee, as a wall of fire for thy defence. Maye&s;t thou know an abiding in thy tents, O I&s;rael! Let not the earth, nor all its en|chantments, entice thee from the cro&s;s, O I&s;rael! the Lord alone can keep thee, and he only is worthy of thy clo&s;e&s;t attention. Keep near, keep near, O cho&s;en genera|tion; keep near thy divine teacher, who is graciou&s;ly vouch&s;afing to teach thee him|&s;elf! Dwell deep, O ye travailing &s;ouls, give not back; go on with him that hath called you, although it may be through fire and water; through frowns and reproaches: the everla&s;ting arm will be underneath to &s;upport you, as you make God your refuge, and continue faithful in the glorious work of reformation, which he is fitting &s;ome of you for. My life in tenderne&s;s runs out towards you: ye are as bone of my bone, and fle&s;h of my fle&s;h. Oh! may the Lord protect and pre&s;erve you&mdash;may the ble&s;&s;ings of the everla&s;ting hills re&s;t upon you; and e&s;pecially upon &s;uch of you as have been as it were &s;eparated from your brethren, and
<PB N="62" REF="032810_0075_0FF52A141899D618">
devoted to the great work of the Lord in the earth; and be ye a&s;&s;ured, if ye hold fa&s;t the beginning of your confidence and en|gagement &s;teadfa&s;tly to the end, no weapon formed again&s;t you &s;hall ever pro&s;per; the tongue that ri&s;eth in judgment again&s;t you &s;hall be condemned, and even though Gog and Magog wage war and oppo&s;e you, the Lamb and his followers &s;hall have the vic|tory.</Q>&mdash;And as I have good grounds to be|lieve this was written in the good-will of 'him who dwelt in the bu&s;h,' I feel ea&s;y to tran&s;cribe it here, and give it a place in the&s;e memoirs.</P>
<P>Having &s;ome time before this di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my &s;chool at Providence, I opened one at Smith|field, on the 12th of the 4th month 1778, under the care, in&s;pection and direction of a &s;olid committee appointed by the monthly meeting for that purpo&s;e. Soon after this, I took &s;eve|ral colds one after another, until at length, on the 26th of the 2d month, leaving our month|ly meeting, being quite unable to &s;it through it, I went to my &s;i&s;ter's, where I was confined &s;everal weeks, brought very low, and at times ready to doubt my recovery. Indeed many of my friends and relations pretty much gave over expecting it. I was, after a &s;ea&s;on of deep exerci&s;e and probation, enabled to re&s;ign up life and all into the hands of him who made me, and to &s;ay in &s;incerity, thy will be done in life or death. And as I lay one night in great di&s;tre&s;s of body, and deep thoughtfulne&s;s of
<PB N="63" REF="032810_0076_0FF52AF59C5AF110">
mind, I was drawn into an awful view of death, eternity and eternal judgment, in a manner that I never had before; but feeling my mind perfectly re&s;igned to depart this life and launch into an endle&s;s eternity, if &s;o the Lord my God &s;hould plea&s;e to order it; and finding all pain of body and anxiety of mind removed, I lay &s;till &s;ome time, thinking pro|bably I might ere long be relea&s;ed from all the pangs and toils of time, into the glorious rejoicings of eternal life. But, after a con|&s;iderable length of time had pa&s;&s;ed in inward and profound &s;tillne&s;s and adoration, large fields of labour were opened, and I &s;aw that I mu&s;t travel from place to place in this and di&s;tant lands, in the Lord's commi&s;&s;ion and &s;ervice. From this time I never entertained a doubt of my recovery, although I had afterwards a return or two of the di&s;order more &s;evere than before; for the&s;e openings were in the fre&s;h evidence of divine life, which never deceived me. A flow of divine favour, in the &s;heddings abroad of the love of God in my heart, remained fre&s;h and living with me through mo&s;t of the remaining time of my illne&s;s. After a few days I began to recover, and pretty &s;oon got a little about again, and before a great while attained my u&s;ual &s;tate of health: may thank&s;giving and glory and honour be ever a&s;cribed by my &s;oul to him who has been with me in &s;ickne&s;s and in health, &s;upporting and pre&s;erving me in both, and enabling me to re&s;ign to his divine di&s;po&s;al.

<P>About the latter end of the &s;ixth month this year, an old acquaintance of mine, being now collector of rates, came and demanded one of me. I a&s;ked him what it was for? He &s;aid, to &s;ink the paper money. I told him, as that money was made expre&s;sly for the purpo&s;e of carrying on war, I had refu&s;ed to take it; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on could not pay a tax to &s;ink it, believing it my duty to bear te&s;timony again&s;t war and fighting. I informed him that for divers years pa&s;t, even divers years before the war began, and when I had no expectation of ever being tried in this way, it had been a &s;ettled belief with me that it was not right to pay &s;uch taxes; at lea&s;t not right for me, nor in my appre|hen&s;ion, right in it&s;elf; though many &s;incere brethren may not at pre&s;ent &s;ee its repugnan|cy to the pure and peaceable &s;pirit of the go&s;pel. I let him know I did not wi&s;h to put him to any trouble, but would be glad to pay it if I could con&s;i&s;tently with my per&s;ua|&s;ion. He appeared moderate, thoughtful and rather tender; and after a time of free and pretty full conver&s;ation upon the &s;ubject, went away in a plea&s;ant di&s;po&s;ition of mind, I being truly glad to &s;ee him &s;o. Divers &s;uch

demands were made of me in tho&s;e trouble|&s;ome times for divers years: I ever found it be&s;t to be very calm and candid; and to open, as I was from time to time enabled, the genuine grounds of my refu&s;al; and that if po&s;&s;ible, &s;o as to reach the under&s;tandings of tho&s;e who made the demand.</P>
<P>The Lord, who is ever attentive to the good of &s;ouls and the exaltation of his king|dom, is on his way, and truth will more fully break forth; righteou&s;ne&s;s will come into dominion; the mountain of the Lord's hou&s;e will &s;urely be e&s;tabli&s;hed above all the other mountains; but many of the called, through want of faithful attention to the call, may never become the cho&s;en, and &s;o never come forth valiantly in the te&s;timony, nor &s;tand immovable, nor triumph victoriou&s;ly, in the Lamb's warfare.</P>
<P>I think I have &s;een in the light, that too many that have come forth in a degree of true heavenly beauty, and through the fur|nace, being in &s;ome degree refined, have af|terwards loved this pre&s;ent world, delighted in its friend&s;hip, rejoiced in earthly accumu|lations, and let go their hold on heavenly good.

The&s;e can never, &s;o long as their rejoicings are &s;o much in earth's enchanting pur&s;uits and acqui&s;itions, rightly bear truth's holy te&s;timony, or lift up its &s;tandard to the nations. Nay, nay: this &s;tate prepares them at lea&s;t to bear a &s;uperficial lifele&s;s te&s;timony; but very commonly to rea&s;on, argue and di&s;|pute, and that too, as they think very wi&s;ely, again&s;t the ri&s;ing, &s;preading and increa&s;e of the te&s;timony and government of the prince of peace. If there is not a diligent waiting at wi&s;dom's gate and in the valley of humili|ation, in the true faith and patience of the &s;aints, the &s;en&s;e of divine things is gradually le&s;&s;ened and lo&s;t; and in&s;tead thereof, a kind of rea&s;oning takes place, wherein the divine life and its ble&s;&s;ed te&s;timony is &s;tifled and rejected; and tho&s;e who &s;tand faithful therein are cen&s;ured and condemned.

<P>8th month 4th. I have now freedom to commit to writing a little of what I have thought of the cu&s;tom among many Friends of calling one another <HI>friend,</HI> in&s;tead of call|ing them by their proper given names, which I think de&s;erves &s;erious con&s;ideration, why this way of &s;peaking, to tho&s;e who&s;e names we are acquainted with, is continued in. Is it not to &s;hun the cro&s;s? or becau&s;e calling per&s;ons by their names John, James, Peter, Paul, &amp;c. &s;ounds too unmodi&s;h, or as &s;ome may think, di&s;re&s;pectful? Is there nothing of the &s;pirit of the world in thus flinching from &s;trict plainne&s;s and &s;implicity?

<P>In the&s;e days I often renewed covenant with my God&mdash;&s;at much alone&mdash;kept &s;ilence &mdash;and bore his yoke and rod upon me.

in tho&s;e days.&mdash;In the time of waiting on the Lord in &s;ilent retirement alone, which was mo&s;tly my daily practice, it &s;ometimes plea&s;ed him to vail his holy pre&s;ence from me, in order to prove my patience and &s;teadfa&s;t reli|ance upon him; and &s;ometimes to command a &s;olemn awful &s;ilence in me, wherein he often &s;tood revealed in maje&s;tic all-&s;ufficiency be|fore me, in a manner which I have no words to convey a clear idea of to any who have not experienced the &s;ame in them&s;elves.

<P>AT our yearly meeting this year 1779, the &s;ubject of Friends paying taxes for war, came under &s;olid con&s;ideration. Friends were unanimous, that the te&s;timony of Truth, and of our &s;ociety, was clearly again&s;t our paying &s;uch taxes as were wholly for war; and many &s;olid Friends manife&s;ted a lively te&s;timony again&s;t the payment of tho&s;e in the mixture; which te&s;timony appeared evi|dently to me to be on &s;ub&s;tantial grounds, ari&s;ing and &s;preading in the authority of truth. It was a time of refre&s;hment to an exerci&s;ed number, who&s;e &s;pirits I tru&s;t were feelingly relieved, in a joyful &s;en&s;e of the light which then &s;prung up among us. On the whole, I am renewedly confirmed, that however the burden-bearers of the pre&s;ent generation among us may hold on their way, or fall &s;hort and give back, the Lord will rai&s;e up a band of faithful followers, who, preferring Jeru&s;alem's welfare to their chiefe&s;t joys, will pre&s;s through the crowd of rea&s;onings, and follow the Lamb whither&s;oever he leadeth them.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="032810_0085_0FF52A2972BC4FD0">In tho&s;e days I pa&s;&s;ed through many trials and exerci&s;es, unknown except to God and my own &s;oul: but he knew my heart, and all my tribulations, and how to carry me through them; and ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name! he &s;upported and bore up my drooping mind through every probation and be&s;etment. At times I clearly &s;aw he was refining me in the furnace of affliction; then why &s;hould I mur|mur or repine? Or why do&s;t thou murmur, Oh! afflicted &s;oul, whoever thou art? for unle&s;s thou endure cha&s;ti&s;ement of the Lord, thou art a ba&s;tard and not a &s;on. By his fa|therly cha&s;ti&s;ements he brings into the obedi|ence and filial attachment of &s;ons&mdash;he enables to &s;ing of mercy and of judgment; and con|firms his children in a &s;teadfa&s;t reliance upon him&s;elf, through every &s;torm and tempe&s;t. O! ble&s;s his holy name for ever&mdash;exalt and prai&s;e him, even for the turning of his hand in probation; for the exerci&s;e of his rod in cha&s;ti&s;ement. It is all for good, and will &s;ure|ly work good to all who rightly abide the trial. Indeed every trial ought to be received with thankfulne&s;s, as intended and working for our good. And &s;eeing afflictions are oft the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;ings to a true chri&s;|tian traveller, let us in true re&s;ignation of heart, under each painful &s;troke, a&s;cribe goodne&s;s to our God, and, in the pathetic language of Young, render him the tribute of thank&s;giving, and &s;ay,</P>

It was a time of great trial: I was &s;hut up in &s;ilence, pain and poverty of &s;pirit in divers families. I felt like a wanderer through a trackle&s;s de&s;ert; yet, not being ea&s;y to quit the &s;ervice, I went on, but &s;till for &s;ome time found no relief, more than a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of integrity to my God; but, magnified be his name for ever, in depth of di&s;tre&s;s he heard my cry, and aro&s;e with healing in his wings; and was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to com|mand deliverance. My tongue again was loo&s;ed; and, with tenderne&s;s and contrition, I declared of his dealings; with gratitude, I &s;ang of his &s;alvation.

<P>The 31&s;t of the 3d month 1780, I went to &s;ee my much beloved friend Mo&s;es Far|num, at Uxbridge, in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s. His di&s;order was paralitick. He could not &s;peak &s;o as to communicate much of his mind by words; but the lively &s;en&s;ibility of his mind, and the tenderne&s;s and brokenne&s;s of his &s;pirit were refre&s;hing to my &s;oul. Divers Friends were pre&s;ent, and nearly all were melted into tears and heart-felt tenderne&s;s. He was ju&s;t able to make us &s;en&s;ible of his great peace of mind in his late religious travels;

and that the &s;eal and evidence of divine ap|probation therein was now impre&s;&s;ed on his mind. Light and life appeared to triumph over all in him. He &s;eemed re&s;igned to every trial; he al&s;o manife&s;ted great gladne&s;s that in health he had &s;ettled and di&s;po&s;ed of his outward affairs to &s;atisfaction. On the 11th of the fifth month he was decently buried, having gradually declined until death remov|ed him from works to rewards. I tru&s;t he now enjoys a man&s;ion of undi&s;turbed repo&s;e in the paradi&s;e of God. He was in the latter part of his life a pillar in the Lord's hou&s;e: a faithful watchman on the walls of Sion.

<P>In the 12th month this year our monthly meeting entered my name as one of a com|mittee to vi&s;it families. My circum&s;tances in life, and a pro&s;pect I had of vi&s;iting families on Rhode-I&s;land, brought &s;ome di&s;courage|ment over my mind about this new appoint|ment; but wi&s;hing well to the &s;ervice at home, and tru&s;ting in the Lord, I gave up to it; and, pa&s;&s;ing on from time to time, I had &s;ome clo&s;e exerci&s;e, and &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons of &s;olid &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In the 1&s;t month 1781, I went to Rhode-I&s;land, and having &s;uitable company, vi&s;ited about forty-&s;ix families, and attended &s;everal meetings among Friends there. In the cour&s;e of this vi&s;it, I pa&s;&s;ed through a time of pain|ful &s;tripping for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on, yet it was a time of great openne&s;s and divine favour through almo&s;t all the meetings and &s;ittings. My mind was low, humble and dependant, almo&s;t con&s;tantly looking for the way to &s;hut up, as had been my experience at &s;ome other times: but now it plea&s;ed the &s;hepherd of I&s;rael to fit and qualify for &s;ervice. The holy anointing oil flowed livingly among us. Truth's te&s;timony was again and again ex|alted; the Lord's name and goodne&s;s mag|nified and prai&s;ed, and the hearts of the true wor&s;hippers rejoiced; and the carele&s;s &s;ons and daughters of Sion were admoni&s;hed and

I returned home with thankful ac|knowledgments to the author of all con&s;ola|tion for this ble&s;&s;ed &s;ea&s;on of heavenly en|largement and holy confirmation; I was greatly relieved from the exerci&s;e that had for a con&s;iderable time been impre&s;&s;ed upon my &s;pirit, con&s;training me into this little field of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>A concern having been growing among Friends for &s;ome time pa&s;t to di&s;courage the frequent and unnece&s;&s;ary u&s;e of &s;pirituous li|quors; and al&s;o to di&s;&s;uade all our members from dealing in them; &s;ome labour was be|&s;towed with &s;uch as dealt in them as an article of trade: they appeared well di&s;po&s;ed; and the pro&s;pect was encouraging, that Friends would pretty &s;oon clear their hands of that kind of commerce. And the u&s;e of &s;uch liquors is much laid a&s;ide among Friends in New-England. It was once thought very difficult to do &s;ome kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s without them; but now it is found by experience, that bu|&s;ine&s;s is better done, and health, &s;trength and harmony, better promoted without them.</P>

And many, when they do get to their religious meetings, are too often &s;o exhau&s;ted by immoderate fa|tigue, that they are fitter for &s;leep than divine wor&s;hip. I am fully &s;atisfied if men would keep to that holy principle which bounds the de&s;ires, and gives content in a moderate way of living, they would enjoy more &s;olid peace and happine&s;s than is often experienced in the apartments of affluence, or in the walks of magnificence.

There are many ways to oppre&s;s a little, take &s;mall advantages, and exerci&s;e &s;ome degree of extortion.

<P>O Lord, God Almighty, I pray thee ari&s;e for our help; for except thou, O holy Help|er, help, there is no help for us: the people whom thou ha&s;t called out of Egyptian dark|ne&s;s will yet peri&s;h in the wilderne&s;s, and never enter into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the promi&s;ed land, unle&s;s thou, O mo&s;t merciful, again make bare thy holy arm for our awakening and furtherance in the way of life.</P>

<P>After the meeting was over, the language of my heart, in thankful acknowledgment, was a language of prai&s;e.

<P>ON the 5th of the 4th month 1782, I moved with my family to Glouce&s;ter, within the limits of the meeting of Ux|bridge, a branch of our monthly meeting, having for &s;ome time before believed, un|der divers con&s;iderations, and of different kinds, that it might be be&s;t for me to &s;pend a portion of my time in that neighbourhood, about eighteen miles from my home in North-Providence. I fully expected to return again &s;ome time or other, but did not know when it might be. I remembered the movements of Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, and in the re|collection thereof, a degree of &s;olid &s;atisfac|tion was afforded me. I had &s;ome outward pro&s;pects in removing; but I not only did not aim at wealth, nor expect an increa&s;e of outward &s;ub&s;tance, but I had other and I tru&s;t higher motives in it than related to my own temporal concerns. And, &s;oon after I became &s;ettled there, I found a field of &s;ervice opening before me in a religious line, a &s;en&s;e whereof I had for &s;ome time had upon my
<PB N="88" REF="032810_0101_0FF52CCCD3CB94C8">
mind previous to this removal. There were a few precious &s;ouls here deeply and well engaged in the cau&s;e of truth, and with who&s;e &s;pirits I was often livingly united in travail for the welfare of Sion, and building of her walls. We had times of deep proba|tion; and, through holy help, many &s;ea&s;ons of rejoicing together in the Lord. On the whole, I had frequent confirmations that my being here was promotive at lea&s;t of my own growth in the everla&s;ting truth. Lord God! of all the holy ancient, be with me I pray thee, and guide me in the way wherein thou woulde&s;t have me to go, no matter where or when, &s;o that thy never-failing pre&s;ence goes with me in all my travels through the wilder|ne&s;s of this world, to a hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Amen.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after my removal, my dear &s;i&s;ter Sarah Hazard died at her home in South-King&s;ton. She was a religious woman. She improved much in true chri&s;tian re&s;ignation, and died in a fre&s;h and living &s;en&s;e of hea|venly joy. I attended her burial, enjoying, in the mid&s;t of my mourning, a &s;atisfaction in a full belief that her removal from a world of anxieties and cares, was a removal to an inheritance in the man&s;ions of bli&s;s.</P>
<P>I have been renewedly confirmed in the great advantage to families, and even to &s;mall children, that re&s;ults from &s;itting down in &s;olemn &s;ilence, and therein waiting upon
<PB N="89" REF="032810_0102_0FF52CFA41EF4CE0">
God. I have &s;een the children much broken and tendered in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons, &s;o that, even when there has not been a word &s;poken, the tears have rolled down their cheeks, and their looks have been evidently expre&s;&s;ive of heart|felt &s;en&s;ations. This practice al&s;o learns them &s;ilence and &s;ubjection; it curbs their wills and habituates them to re&s;traint, and a pa|tient waiting, for their parents permi&s;&s;ion, to engage in their little diver&s;ions. The habits of &s;ilence, &s;ubjection and patient waiting for permi&s;&s;ion, are very u&s;eful to children from infancy to mature age, and many &s;uffer much for want of it. I have al&s;o &s;een much advan|tage to children, and indeed to whole families, from the practice of a &s;olemn pau&s;e at meals; it learns children &s;tillne&s;s, decency and reve|rence; and, where it is done in a feeling manner, with minds rightly turned to feel after God and experience his ble&s;&s;ing, and is not practi&s;ed in a &s;light formal manner, it tends to &s;ea&s;on and &s;olemnize the minds of young and old. I have &s;een it done in a very carele&s;s lifele&s;s manner, with &s;carce any reverence; divers of the family conver&s;|ing not far from the table; and &s;carce any &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence prevalent in the minds of tho&s;e around it; and perhaps the pau&s;e &s;carce long enough to allow of much &s;olid &s;en&s;ibility or reverential acknowledg|ment of the favours received from the bounty of a gracious God in the ample provi&s;ions of his providential care for our bodies; or his continued exten&s;ion of fatherly regard to our
<PB N="90" REF="032810_0103_0FF52C5FF15A8580">
immortal &s;ouls. I think &s;uch an undevout appearance can be very little to the divine acceptance; but where a proper pau&s;e is ob|&s;erved, and the Lord is therein &s;eriou&s;ly &s;ought to, the mind being feelingly impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of his aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and all branches of the family are reverently &s;ilent: it is an oblation well-plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of God, and very u&s;eful to &s;uch families. I am morally certain, that I have many a day gone through the cares and concerns of life with much more compo&s;ure, &s;tability, &s;atisfaction and propriety for the &s;trength and a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have found in drawing near to God in &s;olemn &s;ilence in my family; and I wi&s;h the practice of reverently adoring him in this way, may increa&s;e more and more.</P>
<P>Our yearly meeting this year was a fa|voured &s;ea&s;on: divers weighty matters were tran&s;acted in love and chri&s;tian conde&s;cen&s;ion through the qualifying influence of the ma&s;|ter of our a&s;&s;emblies, who graciou&s;ly owned this our annual &s;olemnity by the over&s;hadow|ing of his love and life-giving pre&s;ence. Some &s;uitable advices were &s;ent down to the inferior meetings upon &s;undry important &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>After this meeting, in company with divers other Friends, who with my&s;elf were under the yearly meeting's appointment to vi&s;it the quarterly and monthly meetings, I vi&s;ited Acoak&s;et, Dartmouth, Nantucket, Sandwich
<PB N="91" REF="032810_0104_0FF52D88DD9C9100">
and Swanzey monthly meetings, Sandwich quarterly meeting held at Nantucket, and our own at Smithfield. We found a want of charity in &s;ome few, very &s;trict in outward plainne&s;s, who, from a mi&s;guided zeal, held others too much at a di&s;tance on account of their not appearing equally plain with them|&s;elves in dre&s;s, &amp;c. which was cau&s;e of grief to me, yet I am a hearty well-wi&s;her to plain|ne&s;s: I grieve to &s;ee the &s;orrowful departure from it into pride and &s;uperfluity: I never &s;aw an in&s;tance of any very con&s;iderable de|parture of this kind, but what I had rea&s;on to be convinced that a real lo&s;s was &s;u&s;tained by the individuals, or their be&s;t advancement prevented. But I have &s;uffered much deep di&s;tre&s;s of &s;oul under a painful and depre&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;ibility, of that contracted, illiberal and har&s;h &s;pirit, which in &s;ome in&s;tances has the a&s;cendancy, leading them into extremes without the life. I know that truth leads into great regularity and circum&s;pection of life; and I abhor that light chaffy &s;pirit that makes ridicule of it, and lightly e&s;teems the exem|plary appearance and true religious zeal of the faithful. I doubt not many libertine minds may lay hold of &s;uch remarks as the above to ju&s;tify their own deviations from the plain path of truth, the narrow way that leads to life; and think thereby to &s;creen them&s;elves from the ju&s;t judgment of truth through the brethren; but this will not avail them; the way remains, as ever of old, a narrow way, a way of &s;elf-denial, and the daily cro&s;s. But Oh
<PB N="92" REF="032810_0105_0FF52CB9F3754F30">
unhappy and deluded people whoever they are, that in their zeal for externals, lo&s;e chari|ty. They depart from the life and lay hold on formality: for all outward things in religion dwindle unavoidably into formality, in pro|portion as charity is departed from, and zeal takes place in things pertaining to the out&s;ide of the cup and platter, without a living fenfe of the inward &s;pring of life which can never be experienced without living, fervent charity. Therefore let us ever keep &s;teadily to our plain way of living, in the life of truth: for I am a&s;&s;ured, &s;o far as it is rightly kept to, truth owns and &s;upports it; and its influence on the mind is very beneficial. But O, that we may ever be pre&s;erved from a narrow, ra&s;h, cen&s;orious &s;pirit; and from over-rating any outward regularity, or exact living; le&s;t, as we grow in the form, we dwindle as to the life. Although the&s;e remarks may not have a very exten&s;ive influence in rightly guarding others; yet I mu&s;t write what I have to write and leave it, hoping divine providence will yet build up Sion and fortify Jeru&s;alem, di|recting the cour&s;e of the &s;incere-hearted be|tween all the extremes, in the &s;ure and &s;afe path of virtue, where a lively active zeal is tempered with liberality of heart and &s;enti|ment, in the flowings of true charity.</P>
<P>We laboured in the monthly meetings as ability was afforded, and I tru&s;t to &s;ome &s;olid &s;atisfaction. I got home to my dear wife and family the 8th of the 7th month,
<PB N="93" REF="032810_0106_0FF52C9CF8A0CBB0">
and, finding them tolerably well, I left home next day to attend our own quarterly meet|ing. Here I was rather too active in di&s;ci|pline.&mdash;I have found it my bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ometimes of late to be more inward in travail, and le&s;s active in the exerci&s;e of the whole&s;ome rules of &s;ociety than I once was, and believe, when I have obeyed the call into this inward, &s;till abode, and there felt my loins rightly girded, it has contributed much more to the right exerci&s;e of the di&s;cipline, than when, through a de&s;ire for its proper admini&s;tration, I have, by over-acting, &s;eemed to do a good deal for its execution.</P>
<P>In the night, the 9th of the 8th month, there was a fro&s;t which killed &s;ome of the vegetables, even &s;ome indian corn. This be|ing &s;o very early in the year, and coming after a &s;ea&s;on of many refre&s;hing &s;howers, and at a time of very fair and promi&s;ing pro&s;pect of plentiful crops, my mind was led into a train of &s;erious reflections, how the Almighty, who had thus brought forward our fields and pro&s;pects, could cut them all off; and how entirely dependant we are upon his bounty for every ble&s;&s;ing. Were his compa&s;&s;ions to fail, his providential aids to be withdrawn, alas! we, poor frail mortals, &s;hould &s;oon peri&s;h.</P>
<P>In the 9th month I vi&s;ited Friends families at Richmond, New-Hamp&s;hire, a very di&s;tant branch of our monthly meeting. At &s;everal of
<PB N="94" REF="032810_0107_0FF52D0FAC929948">
our meetings at Uxbridge, not long after this, I had livingly to &s;ound an alarm among Friends; and my &s;oul humbly rejoiced in the relief I ob|tained in the&s;e few favoured meetings.</P>
<P>1784, 2d of 2d month. The exerci&s;es of my mind have for &s;ome time pa&s;t rather in|crea&s;ed, in&s;omuch that, for a con&s;iderable part of the time, I have felt like being in the furnace, e&s;pecially in meetings, but much &s;o out of them al&s;o.

<P>And it has been gradually from time to time opened and &s;ealed on my mind, that a part of the &s;criptures, which many generally under&s;tand to &s;peak only of outward things, may be under&s;tood by the truly enlightened to convey inward and &s;piritual in&s;truction. God's de&s;ign is to confound the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e, and bring to nought the under&s;tand|ing of the prudent. He has hid and will hide divine things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and reveal them unto babes.</P>
<P>The natural man not only <HI>does not,</HI> but <HI>cannot</HI> know them, becau&s;e they are only '&s;piritually di&s;cerned.' To this purpo&s;e Chri&s;t &s;pake in parables, that &s;uch as had an eye inward to the divine light, which alone gives

It was not given to them, to the exclu&s;ion of any in the &s;ame &s;tate of inward &s;eeking, do|cility and child-like &s;implicity.</P>
<P>God's de&s;ign was then, and ever will be, to hide the&s;e things from all &s;uch as are &s;triv|ing to know them by their own mere natural powers: they may and do &s;tudy the &s;crip|tures, and rea&s;on very copiou&s;ly upon them, and think they clearly comprehend their meaning, and yet remain in total darkne&s;s, as to the &s;piritual import, meaning and my&s;|tery of many pa&s;&s;ages which they are &s;trongly per&s;uaded they under&s;tand rightly.</P>
<P>Before this wi&s;dom and creaturely compre|hen&s;ion the &s;tumbling-block is, by God's de|termination and coun&s;el, <HI>laid;</HI> on purpo&s;e laid, that man ever may &s;tumble and fall and be &s;nared and taken, &s;o long as he goes this way to work to under&s;tand divine things; not that God determines any certain number of per&s;ons &s;hall &s;o &s;tumble, and be &s;nared, &amp;c. but all univer&s;ally on this ground, and in this wi&s;dom; for through all ages it is true, <Q>if any man thinketh that he knoweth any

<P>The &s;criptures will ever remain in great degree a &s;ealed book to the mere natural un|der&s;tandings of the wi&s;e&s;t of men.

<P>I may now proceed with my own exerci&s;es and openings.

But though I may not at pre&s;ent be permitted to unfold much, I may &s;ay I have &s;een clearly to my full &s;atisfaction, that Mo&s;es, in writing of creation, of the fall of man, and of things in the upright and in the fallen &s;tate, wrote in the pure openings of divine light, though very little under&s;tood by men in the fir&s;t nature and &s;tate. It is al&s;o plain and evident to my mind, in the light, that the prophets &s;aw things in the holy light of Je&s;us, and &s;pake of them in very in&s;tructive metaphors and expre&s;&s;ions, though hid from and unperceived by the wi&s;e and learned.</P>

I believe we felt truth and the &s;eed of life under oppre&s;&s;ion; yet as we lay low with it, and were made willing to &s;uffer with it, we were enabled to witne&s;s it to reign in domi|nion over all.</P>
<P>Fourth-day 18th. Were at the monthly meeting at Nine-Partners; &s;ome clo&s;e exer|ci&s;e attended the fore part of this meeting in &s;ilent &s;uffering with the &s;uffering &s;eed, but Truth ro&s;e into dominion to the joy of our &s;ouls, wherein we had to call the people to an inward, awful &s;tillne&s;s and attention, le&s;t they be di&s;appointed as to meeting with the ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;emblies, and al&s;o as to being benefited with or by the true go&s;pel mini&s;try; for tho&s;e who can only run when the Lord &s;ends them, are often clo&s;ed up in profound &s;ilence by the outward expectations of the people, not having liberty, as they keep to the openings and &s;huttings of him who has the key of David, to gratify tho&s;e itching ears. &mdash;This and con&s;iderable more they were re|minded of. In the meeting for di&s;cipline, both men's and women's, (for we were con|cerned to go into theirs) they were advi&s;ed to keep to their own gifts, and not depend upon one another, to the neglect of occupy|ing their own talents, le&s;t they as individuals, and the meeting at large, &s;uffer lo&s;s thereby, and &s;ome forward &s;pirits be pu&s;hed forward into too great activity in a formal manner by the backwardne&s;s and withholding of others.

truth triumphed and had the dominion; ma|ny minds were reached and tendered.&mdash;2d-day 6th, we appointed a meeting at a place called Durham, about twelve miles north|ward of Danby, of which notice was given, and we attended it accordingly, and had &s;atisfactory &s;ervice therein, though among a people not much acquainted with Friends, and exceedingly outward in their expecta|tions, and unacquainted with the advantages of inward waiting in &s;olemn &s;ilence upon God.</P>
<P>Fifth-day 9th. Attended the preparative meeting at Danby, at the clo&s;e of which we &s;at a few minutes, the men and women to|gether; this was a little, comfortable &s;ea&s;on, divers minds being refre&s;hed in this our part|ing opportunity. 6th-day, 10th of 9th month, we took our affectionate leave of our dear friends, and &s;et forward for home, accompa|nied by our beloved friend E. S. My mind was much affected at and after parting with Friends, with great tenderne&s;s and tears of joy, which, for a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time, flowed copiou&s;ly from mine eyes. My mind was carried back to view the places where we had vi&s;ited, and my &s;oul was melted into ar|dent mental &s;upplication for the pre&s;ervation of Friends in general, and many individuals in particular; attended with &s;uch endeared affection and brokenne&s;s of &s;pirit, as has rare|ly been my lot to witne&s;s for &s;o long a time together. Oh! with what heart-felt fervency
<PB N="127" REF="032810_0140_0FF52D2668B04A50">
did I intercede for the help and pre&s;ervation of the little flock and family up and down in the world! the earne&s;t reque&s;ts that I was enabled to put up for the in&s;truction and divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the many me&s;&s;engers of the Lord which are running to and fro in the earth among the people, that their labours may prove &s;ucce&s;sful, and benefit the &s;ouls of mankind: indeed the language of &s;olemn &s;upplication ran powerfully through my mind with a melting &s;en&s;ibility for all; that the dead might be rai&s;ed, quickened and made alive, in that life which is hid with Chri&s;t in God. Many individuals of my acquaintance, both in places where I had vi&s;ited abroad, and al&s;o at home in our own and neighbour|ing monthly meetings, came fre&s;h into my remembrance with &s;uch ardency of de&s;ire, and breathings of &s;oul, for their growth, pre|&s;ervation and improvement, as will not readily be conceived by &s;uch as have not felt the &s;ame.

<P>AFTER my return from the foregoing vi&s;it to Friends of Oblong and Nine-Partners quarterly meetings, I had to pa&s;s through much probationary leanne&s;s and in|ward want, and at times through deep and various exerci&s;es; but I had not been long at home, before a concern began to revive and &s;pread in my mind, which I had had &s;ome view of for &s;everal years, to wit, to make a vi&s;it to Friends of Penn&s;ylvania and New-Jer&s;ey; and at times it was fre&s;h with me, but without a clear pro&s;pect of the time when. Thus time pa&s;&s;ed on; and in &s;ome of our meetings for wor&s;hip, the weight of the &s;er|vice would re&s;t on me as &s;omething almo&s;t too great for my weak &s;tate: but I was mo&s;tly favoured to &s;ee that ability for &s;uch &s;ervices was not in the creature, but in God; and then I could ca&s;t my care on him alone, and give up; and thus &s;ubmitting, I felt or &s;aw but little about it for &s;ome length of time; but about the 4th, 5th and 6th months 1785, it was much with me; but yet I could not &s;ee clearly about the time when to proceed. And at our yearly meeting at Newport, in the 6th month, as I &s;at in a meeting for wor&s;hip one
<PB N="132" REF="032810_0145_0FF52C89C8A4AD50">
day, it revived with the mo&s;t clearne&s;s that I had ever &s;een it, in&s;omuch that I had a query in my mind, whether it would not be ripe to proceed to the yearly meeting at Philadelphia in the ninth month following, but this pa&s;&s;ing off, I thought I would not yet open it to any per&s;on. But after this meeting my dear friend Jo&s;eph Mitchell a&s;ked me if I had not &s;ome thoughts of going to Penn&s;ylvania, &amp;c. on a religious vi&s;it. I an&s;wered him, <Q>I have had &s;uch thoughts, but believe nobody would yet have known any thing of it, had not the que&s;tion been put to me.</Q> He told me he felt &s;uch an engagement to a&s;k me, that he believed it was right for him &s;o to do, and then he opened his pro&s;pect of &s;uch a vi&s;it, which agreed with mine; and told me it had been with him in the meeting we had ju&s;t &s;at in more feelingly than at almo&s;t any other time. So we concluded to keep our pro&s;pects very much in our own bo&s;oms; and after a few days we had a few words more together, when I found he had felt but little of it &s;ince we conver&s;ed about it; but before our yearly meeting ended, I had &s;ome fre&s;h revivals of it again.</P>
<P>About this time I had &s;ome trying exer|ci&s;es in the cour&s;e of my practice of phy&s;ick; but I found patience was good in the&s;e ca&s;es, and that divine wi&s;dom was profitable to di|rect therein. I think I may al&s;o mention, that, after all my pa&s;t experience of heavenly good and divine favour, I had to encounter
<PB N="133" REF="032810_0146_0FF52CDB38950BE0">
&s;ome of the mo&s;t trying and potently pre&s;&s;ing temptations of my &s;oul's enemy that ever I endured; even &s;o that I often for months al|mo&s;t de&s;paired of overcoming. Let him that thinketh he &s;tandeth. be not high-minded; but fear. Let none think them&s;elves &s;afe off the watch, becau&s;e of any degree of attain|ment and favour. The watch-tower remains to be our place of &s;afety; neither let any ho|ne&s;t mind be too much di&s;heartened at the a&s;&s;aults of Satan.&mdash;There is a power above him, and he that cleaves clo&s;e to it &s;hall know a victory over all the powers of darkne&s;s, and therein witne&s;s that there is no enchantment again&s;t the rightly wre&s;tling Jacob, nor divin|ation again&s;t God's faithful dependant, per|&s;evering I&s;rael.&mdash;This I think my &s;oul has a right to &s;et its &s;eal to, as I have ever come off victorious, when I have not turned my back upon the light, our divine Leader. Sing, O ye heavens! and O ye pilgrims on the earth rejoice and triumph! for &s;trong and invinci|ble is the God of our &s;alvation; and abun|dantly &s;ufficient for our help is the grace af|forded us!&mdash;let all but keep to it, and then &s;afe are their &s;teppings, and &s;ure their pre&s;er|vation&mdash;for, however &s;evere their trials, the Lord will be near them; and indeed in the mid&s;t of temptation he will often lift up a &s;tandard that will vanqui&s;h all the influence of every evil &s;pirit, and &s;et the &s;oul on the everla&s;ting foundations that cannot be &s;ha|ken.&mdash;O, how often did the un&s;lumbering Shepherd of I&s;rael, the great Bi&s;hop of &s;ouls,

<P>My pro&s;pects of a vi&s;it to Penn&s;ylvania, &amp;c. continuing, and the time to proceed therein appearing to me to be &s;ome time preceding the yearly meeting at Philadelphia 1786, I endeavoured to be given up to it; but the thoughts of parting with my dear wife, and tender little children, wrought &s;o upon me that I &s;eemed to hold back again, after giving up &s;everal times, until in the winter preced|ing &s;aid yearly meeting, I was vi&s;ited with &s;evere &s;ickne&s;s for a month, in&s;omuch that many thought I &s;hould not recover. In the time of this illne&s;s I intelligibly heard in the &s;ecret of my &s;oul, in &s;ilence and &s;tillne&s;s, this awful language, <Q>&s;et thine hou&s;e in order, for thou &s;halt die and not live.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings xx. 1.</NOTE> This, though plain and alarming, did not at all &s;trike my mind with a belief that I was &s;oon to leave the body; but two things &s;eemed &s;pecially to be &s;et before me: 1&s;t, Though I had a written will by me, very nearly agree|able to my mind, yet as it was not quite &s;o, one &s;en&s;e of the word, <Q>&s;et thine hou&s;e in order,</Q> was to me as much as <Q>make thy

will;</Q> whereupon I &s;ent for a Friend, who by my de&s;ire, and according to my direction, wrote another for me, which was &s;oon &s;igned and witne&s;&s;ed to my &s;atisfaction. 2d. I was fully &s;atisfied that it was the Lord's will that I &s;hould be given up to the vi&s;it mentioned above, and that I &s;hould <HI>&s;et my hou&s;e in &s;uch order</HI> as to leave my family and <HI>affairs.</HI> Up|on this I gave up fully to the heavenly vi&s;ion, and never afterwards turned my back upon it, nor dared to depart from my covenant, <Q>that if he would be my God, be with me, and pre&s;erve me and mine, I would be his &s;er|vant and follow him whither&s;oever he plea&s;|ed to lead me.</Q> However, though I dur&s;t not refu&s;e to go on his errand, I often had low times, wherein I almo&s;t lo&s;t &s;ight of the once clear pro&s;pect; yet it would again and again revive in &s;uch a manner as convinced me that my peace was in it, and even that my livelihood, &s;piritually, as much con&s;i&s;ted in faithfully labouring for daily bread, and that in the way of truth's requirings, as my outward living or &s;upport depended on an hone&s;t indu&s;try.

Chri&s;t is not without the church, nor the church without him in the work of religion; nor indeed is any indivi|dual &s;oul without him, nor he without that individual, in the work of &s;alvation; but he worketh in the &s;oul, and through him the &s;oul worketh out its own &s;alvation. Here is a ble&s;&s;ed co-operation; and the very rea&s;on why the creature can and does, in a &s;en&s;e, <HI>work out his own &s;alvation,</HI> is becau&s;e <HI>God worketh in him,</HI> begetting the will, and giving ability to <HI>do</HI> the <HI>deed;</HI> but if after all <HI>he will not,</HI> it will fare with him as with Jeru&s;alem, who might often have been gathered, but they <HI>would not;</HI> wherefore their hou&s;e was left unto them de&s;olate, and the things that belonged to their peace hid from their eyes.</P>
<P>Now, after pa&s;&s;ing through various exer|ci&s;es, and finally witne&s;&s;ing a full &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine will, in regard to giving up all to follow him in this religious vi&s;it, and ob|taining the approbation of our monthly and quarterly meetings. I took leave of my dear wife and tender little children, in the fear of the Lord, and in fulne&s;s of endeared na|tural affection, on the 21&s;t of the 7th month 1786, and rode to Providence, thence next day to South-King&s;ton, next day, being fir&s;t of the week, I met my beloved friend Jo&s;eph Mitchell, and, after meeting, we rode on to Stoningtown in the &s;tate of Connecticut, and next day to New-London,&mdash;and thence by

water to Southold on Long-I&s;land, next day rode about fifty miles, and towards noon the day following, got to Bethpage, and on the morrow, attended a meeting appointed for us there. Jo&s;eph had good &s;ervice&mdash;I was &s;hut up as to words, but had clear openings. It is &s;ometimes wi&s;ely ordered, that precious and divine openings are trea&s;ured up in the Lord's trea&s;ury; but how dangerous would it be to &s;quander them away, and lavi&s;h them out among people, only becau&s;e we are fa|voured with the openings, however clear and even in&s;tructive, without the word of com|mand, and the divine nece&s;&s;ity, to deliver them to the people.</P>
<P>Next day we got to We&s;tbury quarterly meeting; on 6th-day Jo&s;eph &s;aid a little to good purpo&s;e among them in the meeting for di&s;cipline, and a few words at the adjourn|ment of the &s;elect meeting; but I was &s;ilent through all the meetings.&mdash;7th-day we had a meeting at Oy&s;ter-Bay, and another at Mati|nicock in the afternoon&mdash;the fir&s;t was heavy, but Matinicock was more favourable, and I believe we both had &s;ome favourable &s;ervice there, to the lukewarm and carele&s;s, and in the way of encouragement to a few &s;incere-hearted wor&s;hippers.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day we were at We&s;tbury, to good &s;atisfaction; called many to a deeper exer|ci&s;e, and feelingly invited the youth to a life of religion.&mdash;2nd-day we had a meeting at
<PB N="138" REF="032810_0151_0FF52C8B7433EC10">
Cow-Neck, a pretty favoured time, though we both had to &s;earch Jeru&s;alem, as it were with candles, and to drop things very clo&s;e and urgent; yet we al&s;o had the comfortable language of invitation and encouragement to the dear youth, &s;ome of whom &s;eemed ten|derly affected. Before this meeting we had a family opportunity in the morning at a Friend's hou&s;e, and had to labour again&s;t a &s;pirit of grandeur, and high-mindedne&s;s, and felt great peace in the faithful di&s;charge of our duty, and e&s;pecially in a &s;pring of living encouragement to a &s;teady per&s;everance in true humility and meekne&s;s, which flowed fre&s;h and lively to a few pre&s;ent, who we felt to be already in a good degree enamoured with a pro&s;pect thereof. Third-day we had a meeting at the widow Mott's, an elderly Friend. Fifth-day, being the 3d of the 8th month, we attended Flu&s;hing monthly meet|ing; a mournful time it was to me, though Jo&s;eph had to &s;ound a little alarm among them. We went the next day to Newtown, where a meeting was appointed for us. Few Friends live here.&mdash;I thought, as I was &s;peak|ing, according to clear openings, the matter was too deep for mo&s;t pre&s;ent; and there|fore as if I, poor weak worm, could &s;teer my own cour&s;e better than the great Pilot, or better &s;uit my &s;ubject to the &s;tates of the peo|ple, I &s;tepped a&s;ide from the opening, and with a view to conde&s;cend to the people's conditions, &s;truck upon more familiar and more common matters, in illu&s;trating truth's
<PB N="139" REF="032810_0152_0FF52CDEA4C32DB8">
gradual teachings; but alas! I found <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. x. 23.</NOTE> it is truly <HI>not in man that walketh to direct his own &s;teps</HI> in this great work, for in&s;tead of in|&s;tructing the people in it, I &s;oon dried up the &s;pring of life I felt before; and I &s;at down in a degree of &s;hame and confu&s;ion, being taught thereby to <HI>tru&s;t in the Lord with all my heart, and lean not</HI> to my own under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>After this went to New-York, it being &s;e|venth-day, and Friends holding two meetings there of cour&s;e on fir&s;t-day, &s;taid until then, at both which Jo&s;eph had pretty good &s;ervice, but I was entirely &s;hut up in &s;ilence. Third-day 8th, had a meeting at Rahway&mdash;my dear companion was favoured in a clo&s;e &s;earching te&s;timony to &s;ome, and comfortable encou|ragement to others. A wide field of doctrine was opened before me, wherein, for &s;ome time, I expected it would be my lot to labour; but as I waited, not willing to proceed in the opening, however clear, without the word of command, it clo&s;ed again; &s;o I was &s;ilent, &s;ave that I ju&s;t informed the meeting how it had been with me. 4th-day 9th, we attend|ed Friends preparative meeting at Plainfield; my mouth was opened in an alarming te&s;ti|mony among them in the meeting for wor|&s;hip&mdash;and Jo&s;eph's in &s;olemn &s;upplication, that the <HI>la&s;t days</HI> of &s;uch as had long been gathering ru&s;t, might, by the fire and the hammer, be their be&s;t days. 6th-day 11th,

had an exerci&s;ing meeting at Shrew&s;bury. Seventh-day 12th, we had a meeting at Squancum.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day 13th. We were at Squan meet|ing; it was a very &s;tripping time to me.&mdash; 3d-day 15th, had a very laborious meeting at Barnagat, though a few exerci&s;ed Friends belong there. 4th-day 16th, another &s;uch at Little Egg-Harbour&mdash;here we &s;aw our an|cient worthy friend Ann Guant, who had twice vi&s;ited New-England in the work of the mini&s;try&mdash;&s;he &s;eemed lively in old age, and her company was plea&s;ant. Fifth-day 17th, we attended their mid-week meeting at Great Egg-Harbour, where Jo&s;eph had good &s;er|vice. Sixth-day 18th, had a meeting at the other meeting-hou&s;e in Great Egg-Harbour &mdash;here it was my lot to have a good open time both in te&s;timony and &s;upplication. 7th-day 19th, had another open meeting at Cape-May in the morning to pretty good &s;a|tisfaction. Hence we rode to Mark Reeve's in Cohan&s;ey. We found him recovering from great bodily illne&s;s, and in a &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition of mind. He was one of the fir&s;t travellers who&s;e mini&s;try was powerfully reaching to my mind, when he was in our parts many years pa&s;t on a religious vi&s;it with Stephen Comfort. It was very comfortable to be a little in company and &s;weet conver&s;ation with the only one of the two now living.</P>

held at Greenwich.&mdash;2d day 21&s;t, we had a meeting at Alloways-Creek. The &s;tate of &s;uch as thought them&s;elves rich <HI>and in|crea&s;ed</HI> in goods, &amp;c. and yet had too much neglected to buy 'gold tried in the fire,' that they might be rich, and 'white raiment,' that they might be clothed, &s;prang fre&s;h in my mind; yet I believe there is a remnant among them, who are in a good degree alive in the truth&mdash;may the&s;e be &s;trengthened, and their number increa&s;ed. This meeting, though very painful and dull in the fore part, was comfortably refre&s;hing in the conclu&s;ion. &mdash;3d-day 22d, we had a ble&s;&s;ed, heavenly meeting at Salem, though my dear com|panion was quite &s;hut up; but my mind was much opened and enlarged; and much I had to do among them in the flowings of divine favour&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed be the great helper. 4th-day 23d, we had another favoured meeting at Piles-Grove,&mdash;at lea&s;t my own way &s;eemed very open, and my mind favoured in a com|fortable degree, after &s;ome time of exerci&s;e in &s;ilence: but Jo&s;eph was &s;till &s;hut up&mdash;5th day 24th, had a good open meeting at Upper-Greenwich where truth favoured with matter and utterance, to pretty good &s;atisfaction.&mdash; 6th-day 25th, we had another pretty good meeting at Woodbury, though I did not feel quite &s;o well &s;atisfied with my own te&s;timony as at &s;ome other times; yet I had a degree of peace&mdash;7th-day 26th, we attended the &s;elect quarterly meeting at Burlington.&mdash;Fir&s;t-day 27th, attended the &s;ore and afternoon meet|ing

for wor&s;hip, &s;uffering great inward want and di&s;tre&s;s: but through a degree of pa|tience was enabled to endure it. Jo&s;eph &s;eemed comfortable, had a little to do in the meeting, and could conver&s;e plea&s;antly with his friends after it; while I was &s;o &s;hut up that, though &s;ome of them felt near to me, I could &s;carce u&s;e any freedom with any of them; indeed I feared they would think my re&s;erve was affected: but truly it was not; I tried divers times to u&s;e a little plea&s;ant freedom; but the more I tried, the more re|&s;erved and &s;hut up I felt, and even &s;eemed to my&s;elf to act like a fool when I attempted to u&s;e freedom; therefore I gave up to be as I could be, and to endure this &s;hutting up with all the patience I po&s;&s;ibly could, as from the hand of God, for what purpo&s;e I knew not.</P>
<P>Second-day 28th. Attended the quarterly meeting, going into it under great weakne&s;s and want; but &s;oon after &s;itting down, the power of the word of life aro&s;e, in fre&s;hne&s;s and dominion, with an opening clear and living; wherein I felt a nece&s;&s;ity to &s;tand up and proclaim the word of the Lord among them. But it being a very large meeting, and &s;everal great and eminent mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel pre&s;ent, it was no &s;mall cro&s;s to me to appear among them; however I was pretty &s;oon made willing to yield to the pre&s;&s;ing motions of truth, and therein &s;tanding up, was favoured to &s;peak clo&s;ely to the &s;tates of &s;uch as had not been faithful to divine mani|fe&s;tations,

and even &s;ome who had known their heads to be crowned as it were with crowns of gold, and yet had &s;o fallen &s;hort that, if they did not ari&s;e and trim their lamps, I believed the kingdom would be rent from them, their crowns taken from their heads, and given to others that were better than they; but I had al&s;o a comfortable pro&s;pect of many truly tender religious minds pre&s;ent, and hopeful young people a valuable num|ber; and it opened in me to &s;ay, I believed the children were already born who would live to &s;ee a better day, and enjoy the over|&s;preading canopy of divine love in a more eminent degree, through faithfulne&s;s, than what many now do. It was a precious and heavenly opportunity, and divers living te&s;ti|monies were borne by brethren pre&s;ent, to the rejoicing of many hearts.</P>
<P>Third-day 29th. We attended the youths meeting at this place&mdash;a large, comfortable, in&s;tructive meeting it was. We were both &s;ilent; but truths te&s;timony was livingly de|clared by two or three go&s;pel mini&s;ters of this land, or of Penn&s;ylvania: after which we at|tended the adjournment of the &s;elect meeting to a good degree of &s;atisfaction&mdash;4th-day 30th, were at the &s;elect quarterly meeting at the Falls, for Bucks County in Penn&s;ylvania, where we had &s;ome clo&s;e hints to drop; but hope there is a living remnant among them.&mdash; 5th-day 31&s;t, attended their quarterly meet|ing, where my mind was favoured in te&s;ti|mony

I was quite calm and ea&s;y, without a word in that way. After this we attended the adjournment of the &s;elect meeting to pretty good &s;atisfaction. &mdash;7th day, 2d of the month, we had a meet|ing at Makefield, where, after deep exerci&s;e, truth ro&s;e at length into great dominion, and divers living te&s;timonies were borne to the great tendering of many minds, e&s;pecially among the youth,&mdash;many of whom were pre|&s;ent, and pre&s;&s;ingly and powerfully per&s;uaded to choo&s;e the Lord for their portion. Indeed it was a precious time to them, and a large number of them were very much reached and broken&mdash;may they live under a &s;en&s;e of it.

In the meeting for bu&s;ine&s;s I found much to do among them; though I was very &s;en&s;ible of a living concerned remnant there.</P>
<P>Third-day 5th of 9th mo. I left my dear companion at our friend Thomas Smith's, unable to ride much, and went to the month|ly meeting at Wrights-town, where Truth, after a time of humble waiting, ro&s;e into good authority, wherein I rejoiced to feel the great Ma&s;ter &s;till owning us to be his people, and favouring us with his heart-cheering pre|&s;ence. I was con&s;iderably drawn out in te&s;ti|mony and ardent &s;upplication among them at this meeting; and in the meeting for church di&s;cipline, had to labour a little to promote plainne&s;s, and good order in &s;ome other re&s;|pects, and had peace in my labours.</P>

The people &s;eemed &s;omewhat reached: I tru&s;t it was a good meeting to many; however, I did not feel truth to reign in dominion over all, as at &s;ome other times; therefore, finding the truth of the &s;cripture a&s;&s;ertion, <Q>ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promi&s;e.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 36.</NOTE></P>

<P>Fourth-day 13th. Had a very heavenly meeting at a &s;chool-hou&s;e, Upper-Freehold, which was a great comfort to my mind, and I tru&s;t to many more; for truth was over all, prai&s;ed be the name of the Lord! In the afternoon we had another meeting at a place called Arney's-town, in which we &s;at long in &s;ilence; but near the clo&s;e I &s;tood up and expre&s;&s;ed a few words, pointing the people to Chri&s;t in &s;pirit, after which my friend James Simp&s;on had con&s;iderable to &s;ay, and I tru&s;t the meeting ended well.</P>
<P>Fifth-day 14th. We had a meeting at Che&s;terfield, called al&s;o Cro&s;&s;wicks. I &s;at long in &s;ilence&mdash;many pre&s;entations attended my mind, but as I waited for the word of life, I &s;aw there were many &s;ubjects on which a man might either mu&s;e or &s;peak,&mdash;divers fields of doctrine,&mdash;a large &s;cope for choice&mdash;but alas! we cannot choo&s;e aright for our&s;elves, any more than we know what to pray for without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. So I was made willing to reject all the&s;e fal&s;e openings however beau|tiful; and &s;inking down into the &s;ilence of all fle&s;h, it was fre&s;hly brought to mind, ever remember, when thou approache&s;t before thy God in order to wor&s;hip him, that of thy&s;elf thou can&s;t do nothing; that thy bu&s;ine&s;s is

to wait in true &s;ilence, breathing to him for help and in&s;truction, not pre&s;uming to &s;tir him up, or awake him before he plea&s;e, nor to form unto thy&s;elf a graven image, or warm thy&s;elf by the &s;parks of thy own kindling, le&s;t thou lie down in &s;orrow. If thou feele&s;t thy mind ever &s;o empty and barren, keep in true re&s;ignation, keep the word of his pa|tience, and he will keep thee in the hour of temptation. Watch and pray continually, and tru&s;t in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own under&s;tanding. After &s;itting &s;ome time under the fre&s;h revival of the&s;e things in the meeting this day, I &s;tood up and declared how it had been with me in this meeting.&mdash;This afternoon we had a very painful meeting at Bordentown, in which we laboured and had peace.</P>
<P>Sixth-day 15th, Had a meeting at Mans|field-Neck.

An exerci&s;ing meeting at Mansfield.&mdash;1&s;t-day 17th, I attended the meeting at Upper-Springfield, which, though through &s;ome exerci&s;e in the beginning, was a good comfortable meeting, truth reigning over all. In the afternoon I had a &s;ilent meeting at a place called the Mount, it was pretty large and &s;carce any exerci&s;e appeared to re&s;t on the minds of the people.&mdash;2d-day 18th, I had a painful, yet, in the end, a com|fortable meeting at Old-Springfield, where met me my dear friend John Simp&s;on, to join me a little in the weighty &s;ervice before me, in the ab&s;ence of my much beloved compa|nion, who, he informed me, was very ill; and James, the brother of John, having left me, it was truly acceptable to be joined by &s;o united a brother. In the afternoon we had a meeting at Burlington. I was &s;hut up in &s;ilence, which is the third &s;ilent meeting I have attended with Friends of that place, but dear John had good &s;ervice, of which I was glad.</P>
<P>Third-day 19th. We were favoured with a ble&s;&s;ed, yea, an exceeding heavenly and watering opportunity at the hou&s;e and in the family of my dear friend John Ho&s;kins, among his children. Advice and &s;upplica|tion flowed freely and powerfully to our

great con&s;olation together. After this we went to Mount-Holly, and attended a meet|ing that had been appointed there for me: it was indeed a mo&s;t melting favoured time; exhortation and prayer were both eminently attended with life and divine authority. A more evident fulne&s;s of divine &s;ufficiency in &s;olemn &s;upplication perhaps I never knew; for which my heart was and is awfully bowed to the God and Father of all our mercies, to whom I bend the knee reverently, and ac|knowledge him as my only helper, and all &s;ufficient &s;upport&mdash;however, I had to &s;ee that things were much out of order at this place; and was divinely enabled to point out and &s;peak to &s;everal conditions, believing &s;piritual blindne&s;s had at lea&s;t in part overtaken &s;ome who had once &s;een clearer&mdash;&s;ome were lame, &s;ome were halting, &s;ome I thought were greatly withered, and &s;ome I thought re&s;em|bled the <HI>dry bones,</HI> concerning which it was queried, 'can the&s;e dry bones live.'&mdash;To all the&s;e &s;tates I had to &s;peak a word of re|proof, of lamentation&mdash;and al&s;o of encourage|ment yet to hope; to wait for and &s;eek after &s;trength, and therein to ari&s;e and pre&s;s for|ward: for even the <HI>dry bones</HI> did <HI>live:</HI> but above all, the animating word of per&s;ua&s;ion and encouragement flowed powerfully to the tender youth, like a river of living water through my &s;oul to them!&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for every favour.</P>
<P>After meeting we made a comfortable vi&s;it

to our dear ancient friend, the widow of that worthy, &s;elf-denying valiant of the Lord, John Woolman, and to their daughter, with her hu&s;band and children. The widow was in a meek, humble, loving frame of mind: I think the Lord is with her, and believe he will be with her.</P>
<P>Fourth-day 20th. We had a meeting at Vincent-Town, and after long &s;ilence, I had to <HI>weep a little as between the porch and the altar,</HI> and called tho&s;e met with us to do the like&mdash;for I feared the heritage would be given to reproach, the heathen rule over them, and &s;ay among the people, where is their God.

<P>Next day the 21&s;t, the good old man ac|companied me to &s;ee my companion, who&s;e life we had lately been informed was quite de&s;paired of; we found him very ill indeed, but yet I had a degree of hope.&mdash;6th-day 22d.

The la&s;t &s;itting of the &s;elect meeting was this day divinely owned, as were divers of the preceding, with the Lord's glory filling the inward temple of the &s;piritual hou&s;e in &s;uch a manner as to induce a living remnant to cry in the &s;ecret of their &s;ouls, <Q>ble&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Ho&s;anna in the highe&s;t.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxi. 9.</NOTE> In the cour&s;e of this year|ly meeting my mind was often bowed in a &s;en&s;e of the Lord's conde&s;cending kindne&s;s, not only in favouring me with &s;trength and ability, but al&s;o in opening the hearts of many deeply experienced mini&s;ters and elders to receive and &s;ympathize with me in my la|bours&mdash;for which the holy Name be prai&s;ed, and let all ever bow before him.</P>
<P>Third-day 3d. I began to de&s;ire my way might open to leave Philadelphia; but I found no way out&mdash;&s;o went to the Bank week-day meeting, and was there &s;ilent.&mdash; 4th-day, attended the week-day meeting at Pine-Street; had a good open time in &s;ound|ing an alarm to the lukewarm, and felt &s;weet inward peace. 5th-day, was at Market-Street preparative meeting and was &s;ilent, but di|vers te&s;timonies were borne in Truth's au|thority. 6th-day. I attended their monthly meeting, and was livingly and very unexpect|edly

opened in Truth's te&s;timony again&s;t the love, &s;pirit and friend&s;hip of the world, and to call Friends into a labour in their families, and among their dear offspring. This was exten&s;ively an alarming day, and I hope &s;ome of them will probably take the alarm.&mdash;My &s;oul had great peace&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be the holy helper. 7th-day, vi&s;ited &s;ome families. 1&s;t-day 8th, rode to Frankfort meeting, and there &s;uffered deeply in &s;pirit, but got &s;ome relief by a clo&s;e &s;earching te&s;timony among them; yet remained unea&s;y, and returned &s;o to Philadelphia. 2d-day 9th, attended the &s;elect meeting to &s;ome good degree of &s;atis|faction. 3d-day 10th, I had a meeting at Frankfort; was &s;ilent until near the clo&s;e, when I told them I felt &s;omething pre&s;ent which exceedingly ob&s;tructed the ari&s;ing of life in the meeting. In the afternoon we had a meeting at Fair Hill&mdash;I was &s;ilent there. 4th-day 11th, had a meeting at Ger|mantown, in which my lot was in &s;ilence. Fifth-day 12th, attended the youth's general meeting at Biberry, and &s;uffered &s;till in &s;i|lence, feeling my&s;elf as a &s;tranger, a pilgrim on the earth: and, in the depth of my di&s;|tre&s;s, I &s;aid in my heart, Lord, why ha&s;t thou thus for&s;aken me? thou knowe&s;t I have given up all that is near and dear to me in this world to follow thee and thy call into this land; my dear wife and tender offspring I have left behind me, and come forth thus far into a land I knew not; and I can appeal to thee, O my God, that it is only in obedience

to thy will and requirings&mdash;Why then am I thus left? why feel I my&s;elf &s;o de&s;titute and for&s;aken of all good? why &s;ee I no way ca&s;t up to walk in? Thus, or to this purpo&s;e, I bemoaned my de&s;olate condition, and &s;pread my ca&s;e before the Lord my God with tears, but all in a good degree of re&s;ignation; and after a little &s;pace, being fully &s;atisfied all would work for good, I was made willing to be as poor, empty and blind, as the Lord would have me to be, and all centred in this, 'Not my will, but thine be done.'</P>
<P>Sixth-day 13th. Was at a meeting ap|pointed by two Friends from New-York go|vernment at Abington, my own way being entirely &s;hut up, &s;o that I dur&s;t not pre&s;ume to appoint a meeting, nor yet to return home, though I often looked towards home, but it looked dark. So I &s;hould have quite &s;topped, had there not been a meeting for tho&s;e two Friends, which I thought I might &s;afely at|tend; but &s;till &s;ilence and &s;uffering was my lot; and yet the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve my &s;oul in a good degree of pa|tience under all.</P>
<P>Seventh-day 14th. I went to a meeting appointed for the afore&s;aid Friends at Hor&s;|ham, and returned with my friend Jo&s;hua Morris to his hou&s;e at Abington.&mdash;Fir&s;t-day 15th, was at Abington meeting again, and &s;ilent in both, feeling great emptine&s;s. It is the Lord's hand, let him do as he plea&s;eth,

he will not do any thing for my harm. 2d-day 16th, &s;topt travelling, and waited on the Lord for direction&mdash;towards night a little light aro&s;e, and I thought I might go on in the morning, if the way &s;hould continue &s;till to be open. 3d-day 17th I attended their meeting at Gynnedd, my tongue as it were cleaving to the roof of my mouth. 4th-day 18th, I had a &s;ilent meeting at Plymouth. Fifth-day 19th, was at the monthly meeting at Richland&mdash;&s;till &s;hut up in &s;ilence. Sixth-day 20th, attended a meeting at the &s;ame place for two marriages, &s;till in &s;ilence; but I am learning contentment, and to endure fa|mine, drought and hunger, patiently. Lord &s;pare not until thy will be accompli&s;hed in me, and all that is in me bows to thy &s;ceptre, and yields fully and quietly to thy di&s;po&s;al!</P>
<P>Seventh-day 21&s;t, Had a meeting at Potts-Grove, wherein Truth ro&s;e into dominion, and my faith and a&s;&s;urance of the all-&s;uffici|ency of Truth's openings and leadings were greatly increa&s;ed; for I had &s;it through ele|ven meetings in &s;ilence one after another, except a very few words ju&s;t at the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t of them. Now in all the&s;e &s;ilent meetings, I could never once, except tho&s;e few words, find ability or openne&s;s to &s;ay a &s;in|gle word, and believe my &s;ilence was wholly ordered of God, though contrary to the de|&s;ires of many, and even part of the time very unplea&s;ant to my own mind; but it plea&s;ed my great Ma&s;ter to keep me to it, until I was
<PB N="159" REF="032810_0172_0FF52BB738D4DBD0">
made to yield and be content with whatever he plea&s;ed to allot unto me in my pilgrimage, however it might induce the ignorant to gaze upon me as a fool; and after I had thus &s;ur|rendered up all, he was plea&s;ed to open my mouth in a very comfortable manner to my|&s;elf, and I believe to &s;ome others. In this meeting I felt the power of the word of life almo&s;t as &s;oon as I &s;at down in the hou&s;e, but the opening was on a very unexpected &s;ub|ject, a di&s;po&s;ition &s;triving to comprehend the unfathomable my&s;teries of the in&s;crutable God. This was the &s;ubject that opened in the light and in the life, and as I kept to the opening I had much to &s;ay on this and &s;everal other &s;ubjects with con&s;iderable in a way of comfort and encouragement to a tried, afflicted &s;tate; and being favoured with the &s;pirit of &s;upplication, the meeting ended to good &s;atisfaction. After meeting I was informed that &s;uch an inqui&s;itive, diving di&s;|po&s;ition after hidden my&s;teries was pre&s;ent in that meeting, and al&s;o the other &s;tate of af|fliction and probation&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for all his fatherly di&s;pen&s;ations, however di&s;|agreeable to my own inclinations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day 22d. I attended (dear John For|man being with me, as he had been for &s;eve|ral days pa&s;t) the meeting of Friends at Robin|&s;on or the Fore&s;t, a ble&s;&s;ed time it was.&mdash;2d-day 23d, we had a meeting at Reading, and next day at Maiden Creek, both I hope profitable good meetings.&mdash;4th-day 25th, we were at
<PB N="160" REF="032810_0173_0FF52C46F532CE10">
the monthly meeting at Exeter; Truth ro&s;e into ble&s;&s;ed dominion, and reigned over all in the meeting for public wor&s;hip, to the reaching and tendering of many hearts. 5th-day 26th, we had a meeting at Nantmil, to which dear Abel Thomas accompanied us; my friend John Forman had good &s;ervice; I was long &s;hut up, but at length, in the fre&s;h openings of life, I &s;tood up, and expre&s;&s;ed a few words, after which dear John Forman appeared again in a &s;hort, lively te&s;timony; and my &s;pirit being drawn forth in &s;upplica|tion to the Lord, the meeting ended under a feeling &s;en&s;e of the &s;avour of life.</P>
<P>Sixth-day 27th. We had a good, open meeting this day at Pikeland&mdash;The Lord's pre&s;ence was our crown. 7th-day 28th, a &s;ilent meeting as to my&s;elf at Providence; but dear John Forman had pretty good &s;er|vice there. Fir&s;t-day 29th, we were at the Valley meeting, and both had con&s;iderable to &s;ay, yet found &s;carce any relief. 2d-day 30th, I attended Abington monthly meeting, and was favoured in the meeting for publick wor&s;hip with a clear opening, wherein I had a &s;hort te&s;timony to the reaching the witne&s;s in many minds, and much to my own relief, after an exerci&s;ing time the day before&mdash;the whole revives the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who toiled all night and caught nothing; and yet, by care|fully attending to the Ma&s;ter's directions, they &s;oon after caught a multitude of fi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="032810_0174_0FF52B9D89DC1BE0">Third-day 31&s;t. Attended Gynnedd or North Wales monthly meeting, where, after &s;itting a while in darkne&s;s, light &s;prang up and brought forth a &s;hort, awakening te&s;ti|mony in clo&s;e, &s;earching language, very much to the relief of my own mind. I al&s;o had more to do in the meeting for di&s;cipline than u&s;ual for me when abroad, as I found my mind engaged and the way opened; for it is my &s;pecial care in all the&s;e meetings not to move or undertake in any &s;ervice but what I find a real engagement to in the openings of life; and on the other hand, not to omit any thing which is thus clearly pointed out, and my mind thus engaged in.</P>
<P>11th month 1&s;t, and 4th of the week. I went to the monthly meeting at Hor&s;ham, and, after viewing the camp a while in &s;ilence, had to lift up my voice like a trumpet and &s;ound an alarm among them, wi&s;hing them to feel for them&s;elves, le&s;t ere they were aware, and while &s;itting carele&s;sly at ea&s;e, the enemy &s;hould &s;urround them and lead them captive away.</P>
<P>After this I &s;at in a low, &s;uffering &s;tate through the whole tran&s;actions of their bu&s;i|ne&s;s; but ju&s;t at the clo&s;e my trumpet was again prepared to &s;ound; and feeling &s;trength to ari&s;e out of great weakne&s;s, and light out of ob&s;curity, I &s;o renewed the alarm among them, as to feel quite ea&s;y and comfortable in my mind&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord who helped
<PB N="162" REF="032810_0175_0FF52B80062322F0">
me; for I &s;en&s;ibly felt, that, had not his power aro&s;e for my deliverance I mu&s;t have &s;unk down under a load of di&s;tre&s;s, and gone away burthened in &s;pirit, having no might nor ability to throw my heavy load off my&s;elf. Indeed I grow weaker and weaker, blinder and blinder, in my&s;elf: but herein I truly rejoice, for it brings into the clearne&s;s, into deep dependance upon God alone, whereby his grace is felt to be all-&s;ufficient, and an un&s;haken evidence, that with the divine Arm there is no lack.</P>
<P>Many deep le&s;&s;ons of in&s;truction are open|ed in this dependant &s;tate, which had utterly e&s;caped the penetration of the wi&s;e and pru|dent. Therefore, O Lord! ever keep me low enough before thee. I have &s;o clearly &s;een this to be the only way for divine enlarge|ment and true con&s;olation, that I de&s;ire it, I crave it of thee more earne&s;tly than corn, wine, or oil.</P>
<P>Oh, what numbers mi&s;s of the be&s;t in&s;truc|tion and the pure&s;t joy, by continuing, even after great mortification, alive in them&s;elves in their religious performances.

are not aware, they will retard the work of the Lord in them&s;elves and in others, through their bu&s;y attempts to promote it: and yet perhaps they may be pretending to wait for, and giving out that they feel much divine influence.</P>
<P>Oh, the &s;ubtilty of the &s;erpent, e&s;pecially in his re&s;emblance of an angel of light! many hath he caught, beguiled and ruined; the pure openings of life are very different, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hable from all his fal&s;e vi&s;ions and likene&s;|&s;es; the deep, humble, careful traveller finds it &s;o to his un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction; and yet how many are taking the latter for the for|mer, for want of depth and patience enough in waiting!&mdash;hereby the innocent, precious life in them becomes wounded, and the true &s;implicity betrayed&mdash;for, <Q>the adultere&s;s will hunt,</Q> even 'for the precious life,'<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. vi. 26.</NOTE> as the wi&s;e man te&s;tifies; and I believe the truly wi&s;e in heart, not in earthly wi&s;dom, but heavenly, do really find it &s;o; for the <HI>life</HI> is the very thing the adver&s;ary &s;trikes at, and if he can keep us from the &s;en&s;ible feelings and openings thereof in our religious engage|ments, he cares not how active we are with|out it, nor how much we pretend to it; for the more of all this, the &s;ecurer he hath us, and the more we promote his kingdom and intere&s;t. Oh, where will many appear at la&s;t, after all the cry of Lord, Lord, have we not prophe&s;ied in thy name, and in thy name ca&s;t

<P>This is a &s;ubject that greatly engages my attention, in earne&s;t wi&s;hes that thou who reade&s;t the&s;e hints may be pre&s;erved out of, and wi&s;ely &s;hun the dreadful &s;nare, and yet have a care of di&s;obedience. But when things open in the light, give up to the hea|venly vi&s;ion, and confer not with fle&s;h and blood. The path, though narrow, may yet be travelled in. It is a way wherein all the true wayfaring men, though fools, may walk and not err; but then they mu&s;t carefully attend to the light for the <HI>way-marks,</HI> as the <HI>light,</HI> and that <HI>only,</HI> makes them manife&s;t, keeping a <HI>&s;ingle eye</HI> thereto, never once be|ginning to think of taking le&s;s heed to it, or that now, after much experience, they can do pretty well with le&s;s clearne&s;s and le&s;s bright &s;hining thereof than heretofore. For alas, this is a mi&s;take and dangerous delu&s;ion, and he that continues to give way to it will &s;oon walk in darkne&s;s, not knowing whither he goeth: his feet will &s;tumble in the dark until he falls into the bottomle&s;s pit with the bea&s;t and fal&s;e prophet. But thou, who&s;e eye is kept carefully &s;ingle and attentive to the <HI>light,</HI> &s;halt witne&s;s thy whole body to be full of light, and &s;halt journey forward &s;afely, until thou arrive&s;t at that city that needs not the light of the &s;un nor the moon, for the Lord God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.

<P>Sixth-day 3d. I went to &s;ee two or three families, but have felt very different from that openne&s;s, freedom, cheerfulne&s;s and &s;atisfac|tion, which I felt in a good degree when here before.

<P>7th-day 4th. I am going pre&s;ently to the &s;elect quarterly meeting. O Lord my God, be with me; keep me low; keep me hum|ble; keep me al&s;o faithful and attentive to thy divine movings, whether in &s;ilence or utter|ance; for I know that without thee I can do nothing rightly&mdash;I attended the above-men|tioned &s;elect meeting, and felt great weight and exerci&s;e attend me; but, &s;inking down to the pure gift, I was after a little time rai&s;ed up in Truth's dominion to ea&s;e my mind among my brethren and &s;i&s;ters of this meet|ing, after which I was drawn forth in &s;up|plication, and the meeting ended to &s;olid &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="032810_0179_0FF52D6A36DB78E8">Fir&s;t-day 5th. In the forenoon I attended Market-Street meeting, and &s;oon feeling a very weighty concern re&s;ting on my &s;pirit, I &s;tood up in the fre&s;h openings of life, and began to expre&s;s what I had in commi&s;&s;ion; but keeping carefully to the divine guide, I &s;oon felt all to be &s;hut up again, whereupon I immediately &s;at down, rejoicing that I was pre&s;erved from proclaiming <HI>without life,</HI> what ju&s;t before was opened <HI>in the life:</HI> &s;o I &s;at quite ea&s;y, being delivered from the great weight and exerci&s;e which I had felt, until towards the end of the meeting, and after another Friend had well declared the truth among us, when I again &s;tood up and very fully cleared my mind. I left this meeting in true joy of heart, and rejoiced in the Lord my gracious Pre&s;erver, who is learning me to depend on and attend to his <HI>&s;huttings</HI> as well as his <HI>openings:</HI> and this is the only way of &s;afety. In the afternoon I went to the Bank meeting, and had good open &s;ervice, and though in a &s;hort, I hope comfortable te&s;timony to a living remnant pre&s;ent.

<P>Second-day 6th. Attended the quarterly meeting for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline. In the fir&s;t I had a &s;hort open te&s;timony, after which our friend John Storer had a good open time, to our edification and comfort. In the meet|ing for church di&s;cipline, I was &s;hut up in

&s;ilence and mourning. There was recom|mended down from the yearly meeting, a re|newed care and exertion for the pre&s;ervation and recovery of the young and ri&s;ing genera|tion, who are many of them greatly departed from primitive plainne&s;s and &s;implicity. My &s;pirit was bowed in &s;ympathy and union with a few tribulated &s;ouls who mourn the de&s;ola|tion of Sion, and u&s;e their hone&s;t endeavours for her re&s;toration. One remark of dear John Storer's I cannot well omit to in&s;ert nere: He &s;aid, in the meeting for bu&s;ine&s;s, that he never knew any one to grow and pro&s;per in religion, who was negligent as to the attendance of religious meetings. Now I wi&s;h this &s;olid remark, founded on impartial ob&s;ervation, may have its proper effect, to the quickening of all who heard or who may here read it, to the diligent di&s;charge of that great and important duty.</P>
<P>Third-day 7th. I had good open &s;ervice at the youths meeting at Market-Street hou&s;e. It was a large &s;olid meeting, and I laid things clo&s;e home to negligent parents; but to the hone&s;t, faithful labourers, as well as to the tender youth among them, the language of con&s;olation and encouragement flowed &s;weet|ly and freely. I hope to the refre&s;hment of &s;ome of their &s;ouls. In the afternoon there was a meeting for the negroes; it was not to me a very lively meeting, yet was in degree owned and favoured, and &s;everal te&s;timonies were borne, among which I was not wholly

<P>Fifth-day 9th.

I had good open &s;ervice on divers important &s;ubjects, particularly the guarded education, over&s;ight, and nurture of our youth.</P>
<P>Sixth-day 10th. Attended the youths meet|ing; it was large and favoured with the own|ings of life, and with divers living te&s;timonies &mdash;I was &s;ilent and well &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Seventh-day 11th. I got to the &s;elect quar|terly meeting at Concord, where, as at A|bington, I was quite &s;hut up, until near the end of this day's &s;itting of &s;aid meeting; but life then ari&s;ing, I &s;tood up in the opening thereof, had great &s;atisfaction in my labours among them, mo&s;tly in a way of encourage|ment,

<P>Fourth-day 15th. I was at Wilmington monthly meeting, and quite &s;ilent through the whole thereof&mdash;it being a low time with me, though divers Friends &s;eemed to be fa|voured. Fifth-day 16th, quite &s;ilent again at Kennet monthly meeting until towards the end of their bu&s;ine&s;s, when I was concerned to point them to the life in the tran&s;actions of church affairs. Sixth-day 17th, I went to Bradford monthly meeting held at Caln, and &s;at &s;ilent, except towards the end of the la&s;t meeting, I &s;pake a few words of the danger of a forward mini&s;try. 7th-day 18th, I at|tended the &s;elect quarterly meeting at Lon|don-Grove for the we&s;tern quarter.&mdash;Here, through laborious travail in the deeps, life &s;o far aro&s;e as to enable me to ea&s;e my mind in degree.</P>

I was now, and mo&s;tly for a week pa&s;t, aba&s;ed as in the du&s;t&mdash;I could &s;ee no way to go forward; nor yet could I go homeward&mdash;and though this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;pen&s;ation is upon me while I write the&s;e lines, yet through the experience I have al|ready had, my faith fails not; but I have an un&s;haken confidence that all does and will work for good, and for my enlargement, in the Lord's time; but I find patience exceed|ingly nece&s;&s;ary: for thus to be &s;hut up a week or two weeks at a time, and feel in great degree de&s;titute of divine enjoyment, is very trying; and to feel it altogether out of our own power to help our&s;elves out of this trying &s;tate, brings the creature very low and humble; but, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, he never has failed to ari&s;e in his own time, and to de|liver my &s;oul from all trouble; and I firmly believe he will, if I keep in the patience, give the new &s;ong of prai&s;e to his eternal name.</P>
<P>Fourth-day 22d. Attended their mid-week meeting at London-Grove, where my tongue as it were &s;till clave to the roof of my mouth, while Mary Hu&s;bands was much favoured
<PB N="171" REF="032810_0184_0FF52B97DB191688">
and enabled to lift up her voice like the &s;ong of an angel. Fifth-day 23d, I went to New-Garden meeting, and was &s;till clo&s;ed up in &s;i|lence. 6th-day 24th, I went to Nottingham in Maryland with &s;ome Friends who were ap|pointed by the quarterly meeting. 7th-day 25th, we attended their monthly meeting, where it was my place to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day 26th. I was &s;till &s;hut up in their meeting for wor&s;hip. I believe the Lord has &s;ome wi&s;e purpo&s;e in it.&mdash;I cannot find that I have offended him, or di&s;obeyed him: I know not that I have run too fa&s;t or lag'd behind my guide: I have ardently endea|voured to do his will, and to endure his di&s;|pen&s;ations patiently. O that I may be pre|&s;erved in patience, and yet live to &s;ee his purpo&s;e in all the&s;e things.</P>
<P>Second-day 27th.&mdash;My way is hedged up&mdash; I &s;ee no way to go forward: Who can com|prehend my de&s;olate &s;tate? or under&s;tand my mournful condition? The&s;e reflections are excited in me. I am a man of &s;orrow, and acquainted with grief! the light of God's countenance, which I have often eminently felt, and which I then prized and now de&s;ire above all other joys, &s;eems to be quite with|holden from me, and nothing el&s;e in heaven nor in all the earth can &s;atisfy my longing &s;oul. Lord, &s;trengthen my patience that I murmur not after all that I have known of thy goodne&s;s: for I find daily bread is very
<PB N="172" REF="032810_0185_0FF52C5CBAC44020">
de&s;irable: fa&s;ting and hunger is painful to nature; but &s;hall I follow thee for the &s;ake of the loaves? or will it do to leave thee in times of emptine&s;s and aba&s;ement?</P>
<P>I now remember the long fa&s;ting of thy beloved Son, and that at length he hungered. Oh! then came the tempter, but he was de|feated; for he <HI>found nothing in</HI> that holy Lamb, the Son of thy bo&s;om, that would re|ceive any of his baits. O my &s;oul, may he find nothing in thee! Thou ha&s;t often de|clared to others that the way to heaven is through tribulation and &s;ufferings; and now when they are come upon thee, &s;ee to it, that thou keep the word of God's patience; let patience have its perfect work, le&s;t <HI>the end of the Lord's thus</HI> proving thee be fru&s;trated; for if all Satan's a&s;&s;aults be rightly re&s;i&s;ted, and nothing of his offered food eaten, thou maye&s;t find relief and con&s;olation. And though it is now very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to drink thy Saviour's cup, and be baptized with his bap|ti&s;m into &s;uffering, yet it mu&s;t be endured or thou can&s;t never &s;it with him in his king|dom&mdash;he has &s;et thee an example that thou &s;houlde&s;t follow his &s;teps. And as it plea&s;ed God, in bringing many &s;ons unto glory, to make the Captain of their &s;alvation perfect through &s;ufferings, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 10.</NOTE> &s;o will his true followers be made perfect in like manner. Therefore, O my drooping &s;oul! tru&s;t in the Lord, for unto whom el&s;e can&s;t thou go? He only has
<PB N="173" REF="032810_0186_0FF52C1B5E173F40">
the words of eternal life: and thou mu&s;t not give back; neither heights nor depths, things pre&s;ent or trials yet to come, mu&s;t not &s;eparate thee from the love of God, nor from cleav|ing unto him, or thou wilt yet be undone for ever.</P>
<P>This day I rode back to my friend Wil|liam Jack&s;on's, no way opening to go for|ward. 3d-day 28th, no way opens yet; my &s;oul is brought to tenderne&s;s and my eyes to weeping and tears before the Lord. Nature is ready to flinch, but I am given to believe it is the Lord's will that his &s;ervants, after multiplied experience of his helping and de|livering hand, &s;hould be &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed on the immovable rock as to be able to endure hardne&s;s as good &s;oldiers, to live by faith, and not by &s;ight for a &s;ea&s;on, and that as long as he plea&s;eth&mdash;and to &s;ay without di&s;&s;imulation and without re&s;erve, under every trial meted out to them by his holy hand, It is the Lord: let him do as &s;eemeth him good. Perhaps many trials, many deep bapti&s;ms yet un|proved by me, may be nece&s;&s;ary for me to pa&s;s through, before I can come up to and abide &s;teadfa&s;tly in this ble&s;&s;ed renunciation of my own will; but this is the mark, the goal at which I aim. And it is the de&s;ire of my &s;oul that the Lord's hand may not &s;pare, nor his eye have pity, until he brings forth judgment unto perfect victory; until all that is in me bows to his &s;ceptre; until I am per|fectly renovated, and can render up all, body,
<PB N="174" REF="032810_0187_0FF52C1CF851E860">
&s;oul and &s;pirit, as a living and unre&s;erved &s;a|crifice unto the Lord; and until I can, even when he hides from me, (and to my &s;en&s;ation for&s;akes me) with per&s;everance and unabated confidence cry, 'Abba Father, thy will and not mine be done.' Even &s;o, O Lord, work in me and for me, to the thorough comple|tion of thine own will.</P>
<P>4th-day 29th. Attended London-Grove preparative meeting, and was &s;till quite clo&s;ed up from any &s;en&s;ible &s;pring of the go&s;pel.&mdash; 5th-day 30th, I attended New-Garden pre|parative meeting&mdash;this and London-Grove make one monthly meeting. Here the power of the word of life was renewed in me, in &s;uch a manner, that I &s;eemed to my&s;elf in &s;ome &s;ort as if I had ri&s;en from the dead! O how clearly, and beyond all doubt, am I &s;atisfied in my own mind, that it is nothing el&s;e than the power of an endle&s;s life that again quick|ened and rai&s;ed me up in a living te&s;timony among my brethren in this meeting.&mdash;For twenty days pa&s;t, I have not dared to open my mouth in one of the publick meetings for wor&s;hip that I have attended&mdash;I have been at fifteen: doubtle&s;s, if I would have been &s;o pre&s;umptuous, I could have &s;tood up and de|livered words in plenty at any of them. I felt &s;en&s;ibly that I of my&s;elf could no more open any thing divine, than a corrupt fountain can &s;end forth &s;weet and whole&s;ome waters. I found I could not move forward in word and te&s;timony, to any kind of profit to the peo|ple

or to my own peace, while the cloud re&s;t|ed on the tabernacle; my bu&s;ine&s;s was to keep &s;ilence before the Lord in aba&s;ement, and as much as po&s;&s;ible in patience;&mdash;<HI>before,</HI> all was &s;hut up that none could open; but now all &s;eems to be &s;o open as that no man can &s;hut:&mdash;glory, honour and prai&s;e, to him who leadeth me in the path of this ble&s;&s;ed experience; I can now ble&s;s his holy hand, both in his &s;hutting and in his opening, and rejoice with joy un&s;peakable, that I have learned this experience and this dependance on him alone.</P>
<P>Twelfth mo. 1&s;t, 6th-day. I re&s;ted at a Friend's hou&s;e and wrote to my dear wife, for I had been &s;o &s;hut up that I &s;carce knew how to write before; but now I wrote with &s;atisfaction and comfort.</P>
<P>Seventh-day 2d. I attended New-Garden monthly meeting; here my way was opened in an eminent manner&mdash;it was indeed a day to be remembered by many, ble&s;&s;ed for ever be the Lord.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day 3d. I was at meeting at Kennet; 2d-day 4th, at Birmingham; 3d-day 5th, at Bradford; 4th-day 6th, at Ea&s;t-Caln; in all which I was &s;ilent. 5th-day 7th, I was at We&s;t-Caln meeting. 6th-day 8th, no way opens to go forward, we turned back and rode about twenty-five miles towards Phila|delphia, and lodged at I&s;aac Thomas's. 1&s;t-day

10th, we were at the meeting at New|town &s;chool-hou&s;e. 2d-day 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">th, at New|town; at both I was &s;till clo&s;ed up in &s;ilence.

<P>Fourth-day 13th. La&s;t evening we reached Philadelphia, and went this day to Pine-&s;treet meeting, it being a good open time, to the rejoicing of our &s;ouls. 5th-day 14th, we at|tended Market-Street meeting in the city, a favoured open time, to he remembered with gratitude. 6th-day 15th, I had a meeting at Germantown, where I had been &s;hut up be|fore, my mind having often been drawn that way &s;ince my being there. This was, ble&s;&s;ed be the God of I&s;rael, a meeting wherein the go&s;pel was exten&s;ively preached. Great in|deed was the power and dominion of truth this day, wherein a clo&s;e &s;earch was made.&mdash; Several other brethren having living powerful &s;ervice, and in conclu&s;ion my &s;oul was poured forth in ardent &s;upplication; and light and life triumphed over death and darkne&s;s.&mdash; After this we had a good opportunity in a Friend's family, and then returned to Phila|delphia with gladdened hearts.</P>
<P>Seventh-day 16th. We attended the burial
<PB N="177" REF="032810_0190_0FF52CA0C6E85368">
of an ancient Friend at Derby, where the Lord gave ability to preach the go&s;pel in the evidence and demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and with power, to the comfort of many minds, and I hope to the awakening of &s;ome others; after which we had another opportunity in a Friend's family, in which our &s;ouls were re|joiced together in the cementing love of God.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day 17th. The way having thus open|ed for me to go to Germantown, and then to Derby, as above-mentioned, it now &s;eemed clearly to open to go forward to Che&s;ter; where, through deep wading and a living tra|vail of &s;oul, life ro&s;e into good dominion; though I had to labour &s;ome time, even after I &s;tood up, under much depre&s;&s;ion of mind, looking carefully to &s;ee the way and find the &s;tepping &s;tones; but the meeting ended well and truth reigned, and being de&s;irous of ano|ther meeting in this place, accordingly one was appointed to be held next day.</P>
<P>Second-day 18th. The meeting was large and highly favoured&mdash;and truth was triumph|ant. 3d-day 19th, we had a meeting at Chi|che&s;ter, where Truth gave us the victory.&mdash; There was a little remnant of &s;eeking &s;ouls, to whom encouragement flowed &s;weetly this day. 4th-day 20th, were at meeting at Cen|ter; the fore part was painfully exerci&s;ing, but after a time of ardent breathing to the Lord, I felt a &s;mall ari&s;ing of life, in which I &s;tood up, and as I advanced forward, at

length Truth aro&s;e into powerful dominion: it was a baptizing time.&mdash;We were at Wil|mington, where I had been and &s;uffered in &s;ilence &s;ome time pa&s;t. Notice being now given of our intentions of being here, it was a large crowded meeting, and the doctrines of Truth were opened in my mind in great clear|ne&s;s, and utterance being graciou&s;ly afforded, it was indeed a highly favoured day. I could write much of this heavenly meeting, but all centers in the mercy, favour and loving kindne&s;s of the Lord, without whom we are altogether helple&s;s and cannot move to profit. We had three comfortable opportunities in Friends families in this place, one of which was with our ancient friend and elder in the church John Perry, and his daughter, they living together. He had been in New-England, where I &s;aw him, on a religious vi&s;it, (in company with our &s;ince decea&s;ed friend David Ferris) but now was very ill, and I thought unlikely to continue long. Truth was in good dominion while we were together, wherein doctrine and &s;upplication were livingly owned by the in&s;hinings of the divine pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Sixth-day 22d. William Jack&s;on went home, intending to meet me again in a few days. Hugh Judge and &s;everal others from Wilmington attending, we had a precious meeting at White-Clay Creek; my &s;oul was deep in &s;uffering for a &s;hort time; but the power of him who is the Re&s;urrection and

But here I may note a trial that attended my utterance, very different from that kind of exerci&s;e wherein it &s;eems difficult to find the &s;tepping &s;tones; for <HI>here</HI> my heart was &s;o full, and my cup &s;o overflowed, that I could &s;carce keep &s;o deliberate as to expre&s;s my&s;elf to my own relief and &s;atisfaction, until, after &s;tanding a &s;hort time, I &s;at down and waited to get more command of my&s;elf; when, &s;tanding up again, through a careful &s;tepping along, I had great peace and con&s;olation in this day's &s;ervice&mdash;prai&s;ed be the Lord!</P>
<P>Seventh-day 23d. We had a truly ble&s;&s;ed opportunity in a meeting at Oke&s;in, where Truth eminently favoured us, and opened divers important doctrines and &s;tates, which &s;tates were livingly &s;poken to in Truth's au|thority, to the tendering many minds; may it be to their la&s;ting benefit and in&s;truction. The&s;e four la&s;t meetings were in the govern|ment or &s;tate of Delaware, and in the county of New-Ca&s;tle. After this la&s;t meeting we went to &s;ee our ancient friend Thomas Carleton, in his eighty-eighth year, who had been in New-England in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel, having been e&s;teemed a living mini|&s;ter of Chri&s;t.

<P>Fir&s;t-day 24th. We were at meeting at Concord, in Che&s;ter county, Penn&s;ylvania, at which place I had before attended a quar|terly meeting, unable then to open my mouth in a religious meeting; but now the Lord &s;et before me an open door, which indeed has wonderfully been the ca&s;e for divers meetings pa&s;t, even the mo&s;t &s;o I think &s;ince my late long &s;piritual impri&s;onment, that ever I wit|ne&s;&s;ed, the enlargement of my mind, clear|ne&s;s of the openings and &s;trength of utter|ance, being far beyond my own expectation, and greatly to the humiliation as well as con|&s;olation of my poor exerci&s;ed &s;oul.&mdash;In this meeting at Concord, I had &s;ome clear open|ings and was enabled to &s;peak to &s;everal &s;tates, among the re&s;t, to a &s;tate of great unfaithful|ne&s;s, even though great had been the divine favour from time to time extended to them. I had to &s;ound an alarm indeed to the&s;e, and to mention the danger of their hou&s;e being left unto them de&s;olate, and the things be|longing to their peace being hid from their eyes for ever; and of that awful declaration being &s;ealed again&s;t them, unle&s;s they &s;peedily repent and turn to the Lord, viz. <Q>he that is filthy, let him be filthy &s;till.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxii. 11.</NOTE> After which a Friend &s;tanding up in the meeting, in

a feeling manner called upon them to &s;uffer the word of exhortation, te&s;tifying that &s;uch was the &s;tate of &s;ome pre&s;ent, and that they had repeatedly been warned, and called upon in a very pre&s;&s;ing, awful manner before now by &s;uch as were outwardly utter &s;trangers to their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Second-day 25th. We were at Che&s;ter monthly meeting held at Providence, where, in the meeting for wor&s;hip, I had very &s;earch|ing &s;ervice, yet dropping a word of comfort and encouragement to an exerci&s;ed &s;eed among them. It was on the whole a good meeting. 3d-day 26th, we had a good meet|ing at Springfield. 4th-day 27th, another at Middleton&mdash;precious al&s;o, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, wherein Truth ro&s;e into dominion, and its doctrines were livingly and largely opened; a &s;ifting time &s;poken of&mdash;better days or more reformed to &s;ucceed&mdash;and a more general &s;preading of the truth among the nations.</P>
<P>Fifth-day 28th. We had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting at Birmingham, where I had been twice in this journey before, and quite clo&s;ed up at both times, but was now highly favoured. Here dear Hugh Judge and James Robin&s;on, who had been with me &s;everal days, left me and returned home, my beloved friend Wil|liam Jack&s;on having met me again at this meeting, in order to join me for &s;ome time longer.</P>

<P>1787, 1&s;t mo. 1&s;t, and 2d of the week.&mdash; We had an highly favoured meeting at Uwchlan, wherein Truth prevailed over all, as in &s;everal others of our late eminently bap|tizing &s;ea&s;ons. 3d-day, 1&s;t mo. 2d, we had another favoured meeting at Go&s;hen. The doctrines of Truth di&s;tilled as the dew, and dropped as the gentle rain, to the refre&s;hing of many a tender plant, and I tru&s;t to the opening of many under&s;tandings. After the meeting at Go&s;hen, we parted with our dear friend Edith Sharple&s;s, a living go&s;pel mini|&s;ter, wife of Jo&s;hua Sharple&s;s, &s;he having been with us at divers of the la&s;t meetings;

Fifth-day 4th, we had a meeting at Radnor, and 6th-day 5th, another at Merion &mdash;both heavy laborious &s;ea&s;ons for &s;ome time; but Truth ro&s;e into &s;ome dominion, e&s;pecially in the la&s;t, which, on the whole, proved a good and refre&s;hing &s;ea&s;on, and ended in the &s;avour of life: the other al&s;o ended well. 7th-day 6th, we rode to Philadelphia, and vi&s;ited divers families, rather in a way of in|nocent &s;ociability, to take our leave of them, expecting &s;oon to return homeward&mdash;1&s;t-day 7th, we attended the meeting at Pine-Street, Bank and Market-Street&mdash;the fir&s;t, after a time of clo&s;e exerci&s;e, was a good favoured meeting&mdash;the &s;econd very dull and painful; though a little life at length aro&s;e, yet I did not get full relief among them&mdash;the third a very large crowded evening meeting&mdash;and my mind was &s;oon dipt into a clo&s;e engage|ment for their eternal welfare, with an open|ing to &s;tand up, and I believe I got through to the good &s;atisfaction of my friends, and &s;omewhat to the relief of my own mind, as a parting opportunity with many beloved Friends. Too many in this large city appear in want of true magnanimity in the cau&s;e of Truth.

Here I parted, in endeared affection, with Friends from Philadelphia, who now went homeward; the re&s;t we parted with ye&s;ter|day.</P>
<P>Sixth-day 12th.&mdash;We had a meeting at Upper-Eve&s;ham; after &s;ome time of waiting, a little light &s;prang up, Truth reigned, and we had a baptizing &s;ea&s;on together. 7th-day 13th, we had another at Lower-Eve&s;ham, to pretty good &s;atisfaction. 1&s;t-day 14th, we attended fore and afternoon meeting at Burlington, where, in the fir&s;t, after a &s;ea|&s;on, ability was given me to &s;ound a very pre&s;&s;ing alarm to &s;ome among them, who I found were very much unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke of Chri&s;t; which, together with a very open time wherein I largely cleared my mind in the afternoon, made me quite ea&s;y to leave the place, feeling clear of a burthen I had long had to feel at times re&s;pecting Burling|ton.&mdash;Lord, rou&s;e &s;ome there from their beds of ea&s;e, and comfort the hone&s;t mourners among them.</P>
<P>Second-day 15th.&mdash;We attended a meet|ing at Ancocas, appointed for our friend Thomas Colly, from Old-England. He and my companion W. Jack&s;on had good &s;ervice, Truth being in comfortable dominion after a time of clo&s;e inward travail; but I &s;at ea&s;y in &s;ilence.

William Smith's near Rahway; and 5th-day 18th, were at Rahway monthly meeting; and being under great weight of exerci&s;e in the meeting for wor&s;hip, and way not opening to relieve my mind, I reque&s;ted another meeting, which was concluded to be held next day. 6th-day 19th, we attended the above-mentioned appointed meeting at the &s;ame place; were &s;hut up until time in com|mon for meeting to end, and feeling &s;ome &s;mall openne&s;s, I dropped &s;ome pretty clo&s;e hints.</P>
<P>Seventh-day 20th.&mdash;I mourned and left them with a heavy heart, intending for New-York, but often looked back at Rahway, and could not &s;ee my way &s;o clear to go to New-York as I wi&s;hed; but it being homeward, I rode forward to Elizabeth-Town Point, and there took boat for New-York; but provi|dence prevented us; for &s;oon after we put off, the large cakes of ice, floating with the tide, &s;hut us in for four hours, that the boat|men were very apprehen&s;ive the boat would be cru&s;hed to pieces, and we peri&s;h; but my mind was inward and &s;taid on God, in the hol|low of who&s;e eternal hand and power I felt per|fectly &s;afe and ea&s;y: faith and confidence in him and in his never-failing providence were &s;trong and quite un&s;haken. I had not the lea&s;t doubt but the winds, waves and all the elements, were entirely at his command; and though the poor men kept crying out, the boat would be cut to pieces, and appeared in

<P>Fir&s;t-day 21&s;t.&mdash;We attended their fore and afternoon meetings. I had &s;ome open|ings in the fir&s;t, but feeling no command to &s;peak, the opening clo&s;ed up, and I &s;uffered among them in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Second-day 22d.&mdash;We had a meeting on Staten-I&s;land, (where only one man Friend and his family live) among other &s;ocieties: this meeting was on my companion W. Jack|&s;on's concern, and he had pretty good &s;ervice among them. I had only a few words. There is an ear in &s;ome there to hear the truth, and I hope, in &s;ome degree, hearts to obey it. 3d-day 23d, we got to New-York, and 4th-day 24th, were at their mid-week meeting: &s;ilent. 5th-day 25th, we went to the &s;elect quarterly meeting at We&s;tbury, where I was &s;hut up, though William had good &s;ervice. 6th-day 26th, came on the quarterly meeting for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, and adjournment of the &s;elect meeting, in all which I felt no &s;trength to open my mouth.

After this, believing it be&s;t to remove my family to my old home at North-Provi|dence, and having done it accordingly, I ap|plied to the preparative meeting at Providence in order that my concern might get regularly forward to the monthly meeting for a certifi|cate.

And having obtained a certificate of the concurrence of the monthly meeting, it was carried to the quarterly meeting in the fir&s;t month 1789; and there the Lord was plea&s;ed to fill my &s;oul with &s;trength, and gave utterance to my weight of exerci&s;e and con|cern, to the greatly tendering of my own heart, and the hearts of my brethren and &s;i&s;ters.

In the &s;elect meeting truth very unexpectedly opened &s;ome important and in|&s;tructive (though to the natural man my&s;teri|ous) doctrines clearly to the under&s;tanding of my mind; and the power of the word of life accompanying, I opened them, &s;o far as re|quired,
<PB N="202" REF="032810_0215_0FF52E5D1FDCC4D0">
to the meeting, to the great relief of my own mind. The meeting for publick wor&s;hip was eminently owned by the over|&s;hadowings of divine love, under which co|vering, utterance was largely given, and the doctrines of the go&s;pel were opened and pro|mulgated this day, to the reaching and ten|dering many minds, if not mo&s;t pre&s;ent&mdash;the doctrine of God's free and univer&s;al grace, and its entire &s;ufficiency for the &s;alvation of all, being e&s;pecially illu&s;trated, and at the &s;ame time that the work of &s;alvation goes no further forward in us than we yield to, join in, and co-operate with this ble&s;&s;ed principle.</P>
<P>In the meeting for church di&s;cipline, we had large opportunity in the fre&s;h extendings of go&s;pel love, to clear our minds to both brethren and &s;i&s;ters, both parents and chil|dren, on divers important branches of our religious te&s;timony. Our &s;ouls were com|forted, and the living among them rejoiced with us. Things are low in this land; but yet we were witne&s;&s;es that a remnant are on the right foundation, and engaged to promote the right thing, and we had a hope that the number would increa&s;e, and that a revival might take place in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Seventh-day, we rode to a place called the Clifts. This night, as I lay awake in bed, I was almo&s;t overcome with the fre&s;h extend|ings of the love and goodne&s;s of God to my &s;oul, and &s;eemed &s;wallowed up in the in&s;hin|ings
<PB N="203" REF="032810_0216_0FF52EE80412ADC8">
of his luminous and glorious pre&s;ence. In this almo&s;t extatic enjoyment, my &s;oul bowed in awfulne&s;s and reverence before him, and the whole man was renewedly of|fered up to his &s;ervice, to be di&s;po&s;ed of as he plea&s;ed: and after thus continuing for &s;ome time, &s;ubjectly given up to his holy will, witne&s;&s;ing his glory to re&s;t upon me as a royal diadem, and receiving &s;ome &s;weet manife&s;ta|tions or confirmations of his fatherly care having been day and night extended to and over me from my youth, for my pre&s;ervation and advancement in the way of life and &s;al|vation, it plea&s;ed his infinite maje&s;ty to con|de&s;cend once more (as at &s;ome few gracious, &s;olemn and peculiar &s;ea&s;ons in the cour&s;e of my pilgrimage before) as it were to &s;et open the windows of heaven, and &s;pread before the view of my mind the excellency and glory thereof; and (which above all rejoiced my &s;oul) he al&s;o &s;et open the arms of his mercy; &s;hewing me and giving me feelingly to know that although, at many times in the cour&s;e of my life, I had not &s;o kept under a &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;erving influence as to &s;hun the &s;nares of the enemy, but had &s;ometimes been en|tangled in them, yet there was nothing re|tained again&s;t me, but that all was freely re|mitted and wa&s;hed away in the blood of the Lamb; and that if I henceforth &s;tood firm in obedience to him, and in the promotion of his cau&s;e, as ability was given, I &s;hould reign with him in glory, world without end. I found my&s;elf clothed inwardly as it were with

white linen! I &s;aw that my garments had in days pa&s;t been much defiled, but were now wa&s;hed and made clean. I &s;aw that I had indeed come thus far 'through great tribu|lation,' and that, had I not &s;ubmitted thereto, I mu&s;t have remained 'filthy &s;till.' My very &s;oul bowed in deepe&s;t pro&s;tration before the throne of God&mdash;my cry a&s;cended for future pre&s;ervation&mdash;and I vowed continued obedi|ence through his help to the end of my &s;tay here in this vale of tears. My heart was lifted up in &s;ongs of prai&s;e for the wonders of his love to me-ward; and I had to contem|plate and adore the unmerited kindne&s;s and goodne&s;s of his gracious dealings with me&mdash; I could &s;ay he had plucked my feet out of the mire and clay, and &s;et them upon a rock, in good degree e&s;tabli&s;hed my goings, and put a <HI>'new</HI> &s;ong in my mouth, even prai&s;es to <HI>my God.'</HI> O Lord, hold me fa&s;t for ever&mdash;keep my &s;oul alive to the end&mdash;make of me, and do with me what and as thou plea&s;e&s;t&mdash;I am thine; this is my rejoicing: I wi&s;h ever to remain thine; and if ever my own will, my own cor|rupt inclinations, pre&s;ume to rend me from thee, O, my gracious Father, be thou plea&s;ed to interpo&s;e, and to lift a &s;tandard again&s;t all that may ri&s;e up again&s;t me for evil.&mdash;I dare not depend on my own &s;trength or re&s;olutions, but mu&s;t look unto thee to &s;trengthen me in weakne&s;s, and to make effectual my &s;trivings, wre&s;tlings and re&s;olutions again&s;t &s;in.

<P>Next day we had a glorious meeting at this place, at Friends meeting-hou&s;e, but mo&s;tly among &s;uch as were not Friends, many of them called Methodi&s;ts, a people that abound in this land, and &s;ome of their hearts have been touched with a live coal from the holy altar; but they &s;eem very un&s;ettled, many having hurried forward into much religious activity, being very noi&s;y, talkative, and al|mo&s;t, if not quite ranting; yet I hope &s;ome of them will come to a &s;ettlement in the truth; but expect many will run quite out, and final|ly &s;hake off their religious exerci&s;e, this being the natural con&s;equence of making ha&s;te into religious performances without the pure lead|ings of truth therein. My heart and mouth were largely opened among them in this and divers other meetings&mdash;and this day, in a &s;pe|cial manner, the &s;treams of life flowed plen|tifully and &s;weetly, to my great &s;atisfaction and comfort, and to the refre&s;hment of many minds&mdash;glory to God, who hath hitherto helped us! we can do nothing without his help, but can do all things required of us through his &s;trengthening influence in and upon us.</P>
<P>2d and 3d of the week. We had precious meetings at Herring-Creek and Bu&s;h-River, mo&s;tly among other people, as Methodi&s;ts, &amp;c. though at Friends meeting-hou&s;es; for

Friends at the&s;e places are few in number; there u&s;ed to be many valuable Friends be|longing to the&s;e meetings. We were very clear in our judgment, that Friends, having kept &s;uch numbers of &s;laves, did much con|tribute to the ruin of their po&s;terity: for the poor negroes were put to do nearly all the work, while the children of Friends were brought up in <Q>pride, fulne&s;s of bread, and abundance of idlene&s;s,</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezekiel xvi. 49.</NOTE> riding about for plea&s;ure, living at ea&s;e and in fulne&s;s: this was productive of many evils, and opened a wide door for unprofitable and pernicious intimacy with hurtful company, until, alas, the youth in &s;ome particular places are almo&s;t all departed from the way of truth, and an almo&s;t total de&s;olation reigns in &s;ome places in this land. Oh the mi&s;chiefs of idlene&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion!&mdash;may it be the &s;pecial care of all religious people &s;trictly to bring up their children to &s;ome hone&s;t, indu&s;trious and u&s;eful employment: I believe Truth requires it; that a ble&s;&s;ing attends it; and that much evil is prevented by it. My &s;pirit deeply mourns over the &s;orrowful and dangerous &s;ituation of &s;uch who have, as they &s;ay, <Q>no|thing to do</Q>&mdash;believing they will almo&s;t certainly '&s;oon learn to do evil.'</P>
<P>Next day, my companion being un|well, we kept hou&s;e; and the day following rode near half the day towards Alexandria, where we &s;taid until fir&s;t-day the 26th, and
<PB N="207" REF="032810_0220_0FF52E2A8217CFF8">
were at the fore and afternoon meeting; to both which came many of the towns people, Methodi&s;ts, Bapti&s;ts, Pre&s;byterians, &amp;c. and the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give us a good time in both meetings, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, wherein Truth reigned over all&mdash;ble&s;&s;|ed be the name of the Lord. This was the fir&s;t place we were at meeting in Virginia. Next day we rode forty-five miles to Staf|ford, and had a very dull meeting there the day following; it was &s;ilent, except a few words at the clo&s;e, which I felt ea&s;y to drop with my hat on, informing that the life was &s;o low, and the &s;prings &s;o &s;hut up, that I had not dared to attempt any thing under pre|tence of preaching the go&s;pel; but that I felt a particular freedom to mention &s;omething that had turned in my mind to tho&s;e not of our &s;ociety: I told them, a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel had nothing of <HI>his own</HI> to offer to the people; his whole dependance is on Chri&s;t; he mu&s;t &s;peak as the oracle of God, and only in the ability that God giveth; therefore is under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to keep &s;ilence, unle&s;s immediately commi&s;&s;ioned and abilitat|ed from God&mdash;that, for their &s;akes, through the flowings of the love which I felt to them, I had rather de&s;ired as a creature, that the way might be opened for communication; but that I found a &s;low of love and good-will was not a &s;ufficient qualification to preach the go&s;pel&mdash;mentioning that Saul's <HI>forcing him&s;elf</HI> and <HI>offering,</HI> through a fear that the people would be &s;cattered abroad, di&s;plea&s;ed

the Lord, and Samuel his prophet&mdash;that, therefore I had not dared to attempt to preach the go&s;pel among them, knowing who it was that &s;aid, &s;uch as kindle a fire and warm them&s;elves by the &s;parks of their own kindling, &s;hall <HI>lie down in &s;orrow.</HI></P>
<P>My beloved companion having been un|well more or le&s;s mo&s;t of the time for &s;everal weeks, now grew wor&s;e, &s;o that we were under the nece&s;&s;ity to tarry here at the hou&s;e of our friend Robert Painter &s;everal days; during which time my &s;aid companion came to a conclu&s;ion to leave me and return home|ward, as he and I both very much doubted his being able to go through the journey. This was indeed a trial to me in my deeply exerci&s;ed &s;tate of mind, and gladly could I have turned with him, but could find no peace of mind in looking that way. So on 6th-day the 1&s;t of the 5th month, he being a little mended, and feeling ea&s;y in his mind to go homeward, and I not daring to urge him forward, we parted in much brotherly near|ne&s;s and affection, having travelled together in true go&s;pel love and harmony&mdash;he with a pilot or rather a guide, going for Alexandria, and I with another, rode to a place in Culpepper called Southland meeting, cro&s;&s;ing the river Rapahannock in our way. This was indeed a day of deep angui&s;h to my &s;oul; I felt un|u&s;ually di&s;con&s;olate, and could not refrain from almo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive weeping: my heart &s;eemed ready to break, for I was not only

left in a &s;trange land almo&s;t without a &s;ym|pathizing friend, but was inwardly very much &s;tripped; yet I was favoured to be in a good degree re&s;igned under all, and my cry was fervently to the God of all con&s;olation, that he would keep me &s;teadfa&s;tly given up to do and &s;uffer whatever he in wi&s;dom &s;aw be&s;t for me.</P>
<P>Next day had a &s;ilent meeting here, except a few words of information after meeting broke up, or as we parted. The day follow|ing, being the fir&s;t of the week and 3d of the 5th month, I was at Caroline meeting, &s;ilent here al&s;o, and more painful and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing than any I had been at in this journey before. I remembered the account of Chri&s;t's agony, his &s;weating as it were drops of blood, and crying out to his heavenly Father, <Q>My God, my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me!</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxvii. 46.</NOTE> I &s;aw the propriety of his pa&s;&s;ing through this trying &s;cene: and I believed it nece&s;&s;ary for me to go through that portion of &s;ufferings a&s;&s;igned me: and though he pa&s;&s;ed through his for our &s;akes, he being experimentally touched with a feeling of our infirmities and &s;ufferings&mdash;not but that his Omni&s;cience as God could &s;ee and behold it all without feel|ing it in a body of fle&s;h; but as the brethren were partakers of fle&s;h and blood, he willing|ly took part of the &s;ame, and in ail the &s;uffer|ings incident to the brethren in this life, and therein to &s;et us an example of faith, patience

and per&s;everance through all; and that he might both feel and manife&s;t this re&s;ignation in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous manner po&s;&s;ible, he was &s;o far &s;tripped as to feel as if he was for&s;aken; yet even in this extremity, though as man, he was ready to wi&s;h the cup to pa&s;s from him, yet he centred in&mdash;<Q>not my will, but thine be done.</Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xxii. 42.</NOTE> I &s;aw that there was no way for me to get rightly along, but through the like &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and this afternoon every painful impre&s;&s;ion was removed, and the light of life &s;hined into my &s;oul with unclouded clearne&s;s; I was &s;et at liberty, and judgment was indeed brought forth unto victory.</P>
<P>Second-day 4th. Had a meeting at Ce|dar Creek&mdash;not painful, nor yet had I much enjoyment; but was quite &s;hut up as to words in the mini&s;try; yet had an engagement to inform the people, at the conclu&s;ion of the meeting, of the &s;orrow I often had felt, on account of the gro&s;s darkne&s;s which yet pre|vails in regard to what is called preaching the go&s;pel, many engaging therein without divine authority and influence, who con&s;equently <HI>cannot profit</HI> the people.</P>
<P>Third-day 5th. Had a meeting at Genito, and one next day at Richmond, among peo|ple mo&s;tly not of our &s;ociety; the&s;e were both ble&s;&s;ed meetings; Truth's doctrines were largely opened to my relief, and I tru&s;t to the refre&s;hment of divers others. 5th-day
<PB N="211" REF="032810_0224_0FF52E74FAEAF648">
7th, had a meeting at the Swamp, and one next day at Black-Creek, another the day fol|lowing at Curles&mdash;all dull and almo&s;t lifele&s;s; yet I laboured a little in the mini&s;try in all of them in a low depre&s;&s;ed manner, and in the la&s;t, though dull in the fore part, yet through an hone&s;t attention, in lowline&s;s and delibe|ration, to a &s;mall motion, I found much re|lief. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord who kept me hum|ble, and careful in utterance. For I am well &s;atisfied, that if I had pre&s;umed with &s;o &s;mall a motion to have ri&s;en into much &s;trength of utterance ha&s;tily, I &s;hould have dried up that little &s;pring of life which I felt, and &s;o run into a flow of words, to my own &s;orrow in the end, and to the preventing that benefit which I hope &s;ome received. And here I have &s;een that many, who have a real gift in the mini&s;try, do &s;ometimes greatly hurt them|&s;elves, their &s;ervices and the people, for not lying low enough, nor taking care enough, to find the &s;afe &s;tepping &s;tones, from &s;tep to &s;tep, they run out of the little, though lively gift, into an ha&s;ty elevation of words; not indeed without very con&s;iderable degree of warmth and animation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day 10th. I was at Wayne-Oak meet|ing, it was dull; yet I did near the clo&s;e &s;ay &s;omething by way of mini&s;try, which af|forded me a little relief. I was hereby renew|edly a&s;&s;ured that the go&s;pel cannot be preach|ed, but when the Lord opens the real &s;pring of life in the preacher, I rode after this

meeting ten miles towards another meeting-place, expecting to go on thither next day in order for a meeting; but my way &s;eemed &s;o &s;hut up next morning, that I dur&s;t not pro|ceed; and withal was almo&s;t too much unwell to continue riding; yet had the way been open, I believe I &s;hould have gone forward; but believing it un&s;afe, both for my&s;elf and Friends, to appoint meetings without a &s;en&s;e of Truth's direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I returned to my friend John Crew's at Wayne-Oak.</P>
<P>On &s;econd-day I was reduced to a very de&s;titute condition, wherein all my former experience &s;eemed to afford little or no &s;ati&s;|faction. This &s;ea&s;on of &s;tripping had been coming upon me for &s;everal days, and con|tinued for &s;ome time after. But I have not the lea&s;t expectation of being able, by words or writing, ever to convey a clear and ade|quate idea of the darkne&s;s, de&s;olation and di&s;|tre&s;s attending this di&s;pen&s;ation, to any who have not in degree experienced it: tho&s;e who have may, if they &s;hould read the&s;e lines when I am in another &s;tate of exi&s;tence, feel a lively &s;en&s;ibility hereof&mdash;feel as one a little before them has felt, deeply aba&s;ed, exerci&s;ed and heavy laden; like to what their poor &s;ouls may have yet for a &s;ea&s;on at times to groan under&mdash;and if it plea&s;e God to ble&s;s this pre&s;ent relation to the benefit of any of his drooping children, I grudge not my hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;ore conflict, nor my

pains in pre&s;erving the&s;e memoirs of my exerci&s;ed life.</P>
<P>Third-day 12th&mdash;I attended the week-day meeting of Friends here at Wayne-Oak, as it came in cour&s;e&mdash;it was very &s;mall&mdash;I was much &s;tripped, nor had I ability to &s;ay any thing in the meeting until near the clo&s;e of it, feeling to my&s;elf one of the mo&s;t unworthy creatures; yet after all this I was made to rejoice, and for this very aba&s;ement and re|duction of mind; and this rejoicing increa&s;|ed until I had to expre&s;s a little of it in the meeting, much to the tendering a few bro|ken-hearted friends pre&s;ent, though I could not ri&s;e into more life than ju&s;t in weakne&s;s to utter a few expre&s;&s;ions; yet therewith felt ea&s;y; but concluded, as I had the day before, that if way did not open with more clearne&s;s for the continuance of my journey after the yearly meeting then &s;oon coming on at this place, I might return home: fully believing that he who called me forth into his &s;ervice in this land, would open the way with clearne&s;s to proceed &s;o far as his will was for me to go; and that as he would not withhold the nece&s;|&s;ary openings, I might &s;afely, after waiting a proper time without obtaining any manife&s;|tations to the contrary, return to my family; yet remained given up to go forward if he &s;hould open the way for it.</P>
<P>Fifth-day 14th, In &s;ilence and inward po|verty I attended the &s;elect quarterly meeting
<PB N="214" REF="032810_0227_0FF5188BDE742868">
of mini&s;ters and elders at White-oak Swamp, and next day the publick quarterly meeting here; out of weakne&s;s I was made &s;trong, and many with my own &s;oul rejoiced in the Lord. 7th-day 16th, began the &s;elect yearly meeting, and this day was held the meeting for &s;ufferings al&s;o. Next day two large meet|ings for wor&s;hip, and one the day following; then the church di&s;cipline in the afternoon, and by adjournments until 4th-day the 20th. The meetings for wor&s;hip were livingly fa|voured times; tho&s;e for di&s;cipline, for want of deep dwelling in the life; and more en|gagement for good order, were not &s;o lively, yet Truth owned the faithful labours of a remnant, and life &s;prang up at times to their refre&s;hment. The meeting for &s;ufferings was al&s;o favoured: it appeared that the members thereof had been, and with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, en|gaged in &s;upport of the rights of the injured Africans, at which my &s;oul rejoiced; for many of them groan in cruel bondage in this land. But I believe the Lord will more and more ari&s;e for their deliverance, and work their emancipation; and that through judg|ments poured out upon their oppre&s;&s;ors, if the hard hearts of tho&s;e who make them groan are not &s;oftened by milder means. I u&s;ed among Friends here a plain hone&s;t go&s;|pel freedom, which gave me great relief, and tendered many of their hearts. So after &s;up|plication and thank&s;giving to God, this year|ly meeting concluded under a fre&s;h &s;en&s;e of his divine goodne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="032810_0228_0FF52E49B85A3948">Fifth-day 21&s;t&mdash;Had a meeting here with the negroes, and though &s;ilent my&s;elf, yet my dear friend John Lloyd, from Penn&s;ylvania, had good &s;ervice therein. Next day we had a meeting at Tyrees, wherein I was clo&s;ed up, but my friend had a pretty open time.&mdash; 7th-day 23d, was at Skemins; and fir&s;t-day 24th, we had a &s;mall meeting at William&s;|burgh, a town where no Friends live. I had little to &s;ay in the&s;e meetings. It is to the poor the go&s;pel is preached&mdash;even Je&s;us did not many mighty works in &s;ome places becau&s;e of their unbelief. It remains true to this day, that unbelief and hardne&s;s of heart &s;huts out the go&s;pel, or prevents a free entrance thereof among &s;uch as have not a &s;en&s;e of their own nece&s;&s;ities, but think them&s;elves rich, full, and to have need of nothing&mdash;for the word preached cannot profit unle&s;s it be mixed with faith in them that hear it.

heart-felt reverence, and deep thankfulne&s;s of &s;oul, for this favoured &s;ea&s;on; one of them in particular, &s;aying, 'O may I ever ble&s;s and prai&s;e my great God, for the great good he has this evening done my &s;oul! for the &s;weet precious love that I have felt&mdash;I never felt &s;uch heavenly love before&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed for ever be the great God!'&mdash;my heart was much af|fected at the feeling &s;en&s;ibility which this, and &s;everal more of the poor blacks di&s;cover|ed in their way, of returning thanks to God, both in the evening, and again next morn|ing; for they &s;eemed full of &s;ongs of prai&s;e, even in the morning, for the evening's pre|cious favour&mdash;may the Lord Almighty hold them in his hand for ever, and may my &s;oul never forget the de&s;cendings of heavenly rain upon and among us at that comfortable &s;ea|&s;on&mdash;for which his holy name be prai&s;ed for ever. Amen! And I am renewedly confirm|ed, that there is a real work of divine power among many in this land, both white and black; though yet much un&s;ettled&mdash;may they be brought to witne&s;s a greater degree of clearne&s;s and e&s;tabli&s;hment in the everla&s;ting truth!</P>
<P>After the&s;e we had meetings at Black-Wa|ter, Stanton's, Vick's, Black-Creek, John|&s;on's and Summerton&mdash;In the two fir&s;t of the&s;e I was &s;ilent; but believe they were all times of renewing of &s;trength to &s;ome who attended them. The doctrines of the go&s;pel were livingly proclaimed in the authority of
<PB N="218" REF="032810_0231_0FF52DDB67BA9BC8">
truth, dear John Lloyd's way being opened. &mdash;Next we had a glorious meeting at the we&s;tern branch the 9th of the &s;ixth month, wherein there &s;eemed to be no lack of open|ne&s;s, power and utterance; many were deep|ly affected, bowed and tendered&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for ever! 10th, we had two dull meetings at Bennet's Creek, J. L. in the fir&s;t, and I in the la&s;t, got &s;ome relief, through a little hone&s;t labour in great weakne&s;s among them, 5th-day 11th, we had a &s;trengthening and refre&s;hing meeting at the widow Bufkin's, where a meeting is held once a month. I had a good open time&mdash;the doctrines of the go&s;pel were largely opened, with &s;trength and clear|ne&s;s, to the tendering of many minds.</P>
<P>6th, 7th and 1&s;t days, we had meetings at Norfolk, Port&s;mouth and Suffolk, places where no Friends live, except one &s;mall fa|mily, and a young man in Suffolk&mdash;the fir&s;t and la&s;t of the&s;e meetings were held at the court-hou&s;es; that at Port&s;mouth in an upper room in the market-hou&s;e. The people at Norfolk behaved undevoutly at meeting, kept running out, talking whi&s;pering, laughing, gazing about, &amp;c. I reproved them for their incivility, telling them, that the mo&s;t mourn|ful con&s;ideration of my mind re&s;pecting their behaviour, was the great inexperience of the realities of religion, and the great unac|quaintance with the nature and importance of divine wor&s;hip, which their conduct had &s;orrowfully manife&s;ted: and &s;o enlarging a
<PB N="219" REF="032810_0232_0FF52E2DE73AC920">
little upon the &s;ubject of wor&s;hip; and that God, even a <HI>pre&s;ent God,</HI> is the object there|of, and not any man&mdash;that God, to be wor&s;hipped aright, mu&s;t be <HI>felt after, known</HI> and reverenced; with a little more on &s;ome other &s;ubjects. We left them with heavy hearts, finding very little open door of utter|ance, becau&s;e there was &s;carce any door of entrance into their hearts, except in a few; and yet I had a &s;ecret hope, and &s;ome belief, that that day's work would not be altogether in vain.</P>
<P>The meetings at Port&s;mouth and Suffolk were heavenly watering &s;ea&s;ons, wherein Truth reigned over all. Many minds were much reached and tendered, and a general &s;olemnity was very prevalent. The Lord has a vi&s;ited &s;eed in this land up and down in many places. O that they may come to know a greater &s;tability and &s;ettlement. Af|ter the meeting at Suffolk on fir&s;t-day, we had a parting opportunity with many Friends, who attended from different parts of the country around. This was a mo&s;t melting and reviving &s;ea&s;on. The everla&s;ting Arm was marvellou&s;ly magnified and made bare! the holy name was livingly exalted and prai&s;ed; the &s;ouls of the mourners were emi|nently comforted; and the lukewarm power|fully warned&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord for ever and ever, for his goodne&s;s to my poor &s;oul at this precious &s;ea&s;on&mdash;may I never forget that fulne&s;s of divine light and
<PB N="220" REF="032810_0233_0FF52E1AAE7ED8E8">
life, that overflowing cup of &s;weetne&s;s and con&s;olation, wherewith he enriched my mind in that ever memorable day.</P>
<P>After this heavenly banquet, I parted with my dear friend John Lloyd, who had for &s;everal weeks been agreeably my companion, and with the re&s;t of my friends of Virginia now pre&s;ent, and &s;et out for North-Carolina, accompanied by Robert Jordan and wife, where I arrived next day at the hou&s;e of our kind friend Thomas Newbey. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ix following days, I had or was at eight meetings at Perquimons and Pa&s;cotank counties, at Friends meeting-hou&s;es, as fol|lows, viz. 3d-day, 16th of the month, at that called Well&s;es meeting-hou&s;e. 4th-day, Old Neck&mdash;and in the afternoon at Sutton's Creek. 5th-day, at Little River. 6th-day, at New-begun Creek&mdash;and in the afternoon at the Narrows of Pa&s;cotank. Seventh-day, monthly meeting at Simmons's Creek&mdash;and 1&s;t-day, at the Piney-Woods.&mdash;The&s;e were all favoured open &s;ea&s;ons, except that at Sutton's Creek, and that at the Narrows; in both which I was quite &s;hut up, &s;ave in that at the Narrows I did expre&s;s a few words at the breaking up of the meeting, re&s;pecting the nature of go&s;pel mini&s;try; as that it never was in man's power, merely as man, to preach the go&s;pel, &amp;c. Oh! how I then mourned, and often have mourned, to &s;ee the eager expectations of the people &s;o widely mi&s;|placed on the creature in&s;tead of the Creator:
<PB N="221" REF="032810_0234_0FF52EAFFB48F0E0">
and this is undeniably the ca&s;e with all who expect man to preach to them without divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for man is but the creature, and unle&s;s immediately filled and qualified with divine light, life and power, is as de&s;titute of any ability livingly and profitably to preach that go&s;pel which is the real power of God unto &s;alvation, as he is of power to cau&s;e the outward rain to de&s;cend from heaven.</P>
<P>In &s;everal of the foregoing meetings Truth eminently favoured us together&mdash;the go&s;pel was preached in the life and authority there|of&mdash;many minds were &s;trengthened and en|couraged, and the great name was magnified and prai&s;ed. After this I went to Rich-&s;quare, and on 4th-day the 24th, was at their meeting there, where Truth opened the way with &s;trength and clearne&s;s to edification and rejoicing. Next day went to Jack-Swamp, and being joined by my dear friend James Ladd, from Wayne-Oak in Virginia, who came with a certificate to accompany me a while in this journey, we had a meeting on 6th-day at this place: it was an open, good time, Truth was freely declared, and many minds reached and tendered. 7th-day 27th, we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting at Hallifax, a &s;mall town where there are none of our &s;ociety. The go&s;pel power was eminently felt, and, in the evidence and demon&s;tration thereof, the free grace of God to all men, the nece&s;&s;ity of working out our own &s;alvation through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance thereof, and &s;everal other im|portant
<PB N="222" REF="032810_0235_0FF52F706D0FB0B8">
go&s;pel truths were livingly and large|ly opened. Next day we had a meeting at Stony-Creek, or Tar-River, as it is &s;ometimes called. From thence we rode to Contentney, and, fir&s;t of 7th mo. attended the preparative meeting of Friends there&mdash;a dull time it was, and but little openne&s;s for go&s;pel communi|cation. After meeting, and the two next days, we rode to a place called Core-&s;ound; and, on 7th-day attended a monthly meeting there; it was a low time, yet way opened for Truth's te&s;timony to be in &s;ome degree exalt|ed. Next day we were at their &s;elect and publick meeting&mdash;the publick meeting was eminently over&s;hadowed with divine favour, and made to be a time of ble&s;&s;ed vi&s;itation to many &s;ouls; prai&s;ed be the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>Second-day 6th. We had an exerci&s;ing meeting at Clubfoot-Creek; there was &s;ome openne&s;s, &s;o that con&s;iderable labour was be|&s;towed, but not to much relief or &s;atisfaction of our minds&mdash;which was pretty much the ca&s;e next day al&s;o, at a meeting we had at Newborn. In this town there are no Friends, and the people's minds very light and un&s;tay|ed, that it was painful to behold the airine&s;s and irreverence which prevailed in too many. They got a gentle reproof, and we left them in &s;orrow as to our minds, though but little or no true &s;orrow appeared in them.</P>
<P>Fourth-day 8th. We had a very heavenly meeting at Friends meeting-place on Trent;
<PB N="223" REF="032810_0236_0FF52EB49F64B670">
and another next day about twenty miles fur|ther up the river Trent, at a place where a meeting was lately &s;ettled. Friends appeared pretty well engaged at the&s;e two places, and I hope an increa&s;e will be witne&s;&s;ed among them. 7th-day 11th, we attended the month|ly meeting at Contentney&mdash;a trying time it was to my mind; but way opened, after long &s;uffering in &s;ilence, to clear my mind in &s;ome good degree. Next day we were at the fir&s;t-day meeting at the &s;ame place&mdash;&s;ilent. 3d, 4th and 5th days, we were at meetings at Nues, Bear-Creek and Turner's Swamp&mdash;all trying times. In the fir&s;t, the weight I felt &s;eemed almo&s;t in&s;upportable, but at length way opened, and an extraordinary time we had; divers &s;tates were remarkably opened and &s;poken to in Truth's &s;earching authority, and yet with that &s;ympathetic, per&s;ua&s;ive energy, that it made way into almo&s;t every heart. It was a tendering time, but, alas! the next day was a time of difficulty, as well as di&s;tre&s;s, and no way opened to get much re|lief by communication, though I could not well avoid dropping &s;ome clo&s;e expre&s;&s;ions or alarming hints, but I &s;aw little or no pro&s;pect of much advantage from them to tho&s;e to whom they belonged: they &s;eemed like tho&s;e who had ears to hear, but heard not, or as if they had &s;hut their ears, and hardened their hearts. I felt for them with a heart full of &s;orrow. The la&s;t meeting was more com|fortable, though I was quite &s;hut up. My dear friend James Ladd bore a lively well-adapted
<PB N="224" REF="032810_0237_0FF52DB561D452F8">
te&s;timony, in which I rejoiced, and found relief of mind.</P>
<P>Sixth-day, I re&s;ted at my friend Ben|jamin Arnold's, being unwell. He and his wife were very kind, both being well-en|gaged Friends: the fruits of who&s;e godly parental care and authority very plainly and agreeably appeared in the behaviour and appearance of their well-ordered off|&s;pring. Oh, much lies at parents doors! much may they do, through divine aid, for their children's good, by proper, con&s;tant care, watchfulne&s;s, advice, reproof, re&s;traint, correction and commands; all in Truth's au|thority, as occa&s;ion requires; and that not generally &s;o much in the au&s;terity and rigour of compul&s;ory di&s;cipline, as in the meekne&s;s and authority of the Lamb, which &s;eldom fails of reaching the witne&s;s in their minds, and more or le&s;s to bring them under the government of Truth. O that many, very many parents now too much at ea&s;e, may be arou&s;ed to a due con&s;ideration of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and &s;ee to the di&s;charge of their duty to the precious &s;ouls under their care. Oh, &s;ee to it, parents, I be&s;eech you, for your own and their precious &s;ouls &s;akes! &s;ee to it in &s;ea&s;on, and unremittingly; great is the care that is nece&s;&s;ary, con&s;tant the watch that ought to be maintained. The&s;e remarks aro&s;e not wholly from the agreeable pro&s;pects I had in and of this family, but have been on my mind for &s;ome time, under
<PB N="225" REF="032810_0238_0FF52F86AD1DDDA0">
a deep and painful &s;en&s;e of deficiency of care among parents very generally. However, I rejoice in believing, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;o general neglect, there are many deeply exerci&s;ed parents who endeavour hone&s;tly to di&s;charge their duty in the &s;ight of God, and I have no doubt but they will have a rich reward, and many of the dear youth will be greatly benefited thereby&mdash;that the&s;e may be encouraged, and their number greatly in|crea&s;ed, is the fervent wi&s;h and prayer of my &s;oul.</P>
<P>7th-day 18th. We were at the &s;elect quar|terly meeting at Contentney&mdash;next day at the publick meeting there&mdash;and were &s;hut up in &s;ilence in both, except a few words in great depre&s;&s;ion in the &s;elect meeting.&mdash;On 2d-day came on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the quarterly meet|ing; we were &s;till &s;hut up in &s;ilence, until near the clo&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s, when my way unexpectedly opened in a great degree to clear my mind among them&mdash;though I had an opening in the beginning of this &s;itting, and &s;tood up in the opening, expecting to have had utterance therein; but as I careful|ly attended to the &s;pring and word of life, I found the brightne&s;s of the opening gradual|ly faded, until all was gone&mdash;&s;o I &s;at down without uttering a word, after having &s;tood as a gazing &s;tock among them perhaps &s;everal minutes. I tru&s;t &s;ome real benefit re&s;ulted therefrom, to &s;ome who were too near always ready, as well as to my own &s;oul, in keeping

me &s;ubjectly given up to follow faithfully, however greatly in the cro&s;s, the motions, openings and &s;huttings of life.&mdash;After this we &s;et out for Eno, it being two days ride, be|&s;ides what we rode this afternoon.</P>
<P>Fifth-day 23d. We had a good open meet|ing there, and another on 7th-day at Spring meeting&mdash;this was painfully exerci&s;ing, under a &s;en&s;e of back&s;liding in too many; but Truth at la&s;t reigned over all, to the melting of ma|ny hearts!&mdash;Next day at Cane-Creek&mdash;here again we were filled with mourning and hea|vine&s;s, under a &s;en&s;e of unfaithfulne&s;s, and con&s;equent dwarfi&s;hne&s;s; but after long &s;i|lence, divine wi&s;dom opened the way! ju&s;t as I was thinking it near time to conclude the meeting; and in a clo&s;e, &s;hort, lively manner, we were enabled to place the bur|then of our exerci&s;e where it belonged, and &s;o came away rejoicing in God. On the four following days we had four ble&s;&s;ed meetings at Rocky-River, Nathan Dixon's, Piney-Grove and Holly-Spring. Truth triumphed in the&s;e meetings&mdash;its doctrines flowed like oil! the univer&s;ality and entire &s;ufficiency of God's grace for the &s;alvation of all, if attended to, was opened and declared with divine autho|rity; and many minds impre&s;&s;ed therewith. &mdash;Oh my God! thou ha&s;t given me to &s;ee the wonders of thy ways, in degree, and the &s;trength of thine Arm! thou ha&s;t led me through the deeps! ha&s;t bowed my &s;oul in the deepe&s;t pro&s;tration! &s;tripped me and emptied

<P>Seventh-day, 1&s;t of 8th mo. we attended the monthly meeting at Cane-Creek, and next day the publick fir&s;t-day meeting there, and their &s;elect meeting&mdash;all the&s;e were times of favour and divine openne&s;s. The five fol|lowing days we had meetings at Sandy-Creek, Providence, Center, Back-Creek, and Marl|borough&mdash;the fir&s;t was a dull meeting until near the clo&s;e, when life broke through all oppo&s;ition, &s;o that the meeting ended to &s;olid &s;atisfaction&mdash;The next meeting was al&s;o dull, &mdash;the three la&s;t were open favoured times of refre&s;hment to many. After the&s;e meetings we attended, on 7th-day, the 8th of the 8th month, the &s;elect quarterly meeting at Cen|ter; and an open in&s;tructive &s;ea&s;on it was, as was the large publick meeting on fir&s;t-day; Truth's doctrines flowed like oil, and things were opened in divine authority in both meetings, I tru&s;t &s;uitably to the &s;tate of each. Next day the publick meeting was very large,

&s;till and &s;olemn, and Truth favoured our &s;ouls with a baptizing and refre&s;hing time together. On 3d-day 11th, we had a good meeting, open, and powerfully tendering to the minds of the people in general, at the widow Hoover's, a member of our &s;ociety&mdash; Truth reigned powerfully over all&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be the holy name of the Lord for ever.</P>
<P>On fifth-day 13th, we had a meeting at Chatham court-hou&s;e; but it being court-time, we could not get the court-hou&s;e until between three and four o'clock in the after|noon, by which time too many of the people appeared to be &s;o affected with &s;trong drink, as to leave little room in their minds to be &s;eriou&s;ly affected with any thing of a religious nature; &s;o that we had a painful dull time among them&mdash;however, &s;ome were attentive and &s;trove to quiet the re&s;t: and way did open, after a clo&s;e exerci&s;e, for a little com|munication, to &s;ome &s;olid &s;atisfaction; but our cau&s;e for mourning over them &s;eemed much greater than our cau&s;e for joy. 1&s;t-day 16th, we had a dull di&s;tre&s;&s;ing meeting at a Friend's hou&s;e between Chatham and Peedee; we were &s;hut up in &s;ilence. Next day the 2d of the week and 17th of the month, we had a heavenly, open meeting at Peedee&mdash; ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord who helped us! On 5th-day 20th, we had a very &s;mall, yet precious meeting at Camden, South-Carolina, where no member of our &s;ociety liveth, except one very ancient woman; though once there was
<PB N="230" REF="032810_0243_0FF52F9DB23CB3D8">
a &s;ettled meeting of Friends there&mdash;this was a watering time to a few &s;incere-hearted, whom my &s;oul loved; and an awakening, and in &s;ome degree convincing time, to &s;ome who were too much hardened in &s;in, and un|acquainted with that light and power which is the authority of our meetings and mini&s;try: this they now felt, &s;o that divers were con|&s;trained to acknowledge, and bear te&s;timony thereto, in their conver&s;ation with one ano|ther.&mdash;And I am on this occa&s;ion renewedly confirmed in a &s;entiment I have long been &s;ettled in, that is, that there never was, and never will be but one true religion in the world, to wit, 'the work of the &s;pirit of God in the &s;ouls of mankind;' that &s;ome of all denominations have &s;omething of this true religion, even though &s;ome of the&s;e, through the prejudice of education, may di&s;allow it in profe&s;&s;ion; and that no man has any real re|ligion, but what he comes to the knowledge and experience of through the alone influence of this holy &s;pirit of God. This it is that begins and carries on the work&mdash;this it is, that, by its own divine influence operating in the minds of mankind, reveals Chri&s;t in them, the hope of glory; or &s;o operates from time to time, on reading the &s;criptures or other good books; on hearing the go&s;pel preached; on meditating on the works of creation and pro|vidence; on God's judgments in the earth; or his dealings with them&s;elves as individuals; or whatever other occa&s;ion, circum&s;tance or thing, is ever made a mean of conviction or

conver&s;ion; the holy &s;pirit &s;o operates, I &s;ay in all the&s;e ca&s;es, as to produce the happy ef|fect&mdash;and without the inward operation there|of, all the&s;e other opportunities and things would be utterly in vain, as to &s;alvation, and never able to produce the lea&s;t degree of true religion, or &s;anctification in the &s;oul. So that, though there are many opinions, many creeds, profe&s;&s;ions and denominations, and &s;ome tru|ly religious per&s;ons in them all; yet there is and can be but one <HI>true religion;</HI> all true re|ligion is of one kind&mdash;all &s;prings from one &s;ource.&mdash;And ble&s;&s;ed and adored for ever be the Lord, in order that all men may, if they will, be benefited experimentally by this one true religion, 'the manife&s;tation of the &s;pirit is given to every man to profit withal'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 7.</NOTE>&mdash;he that rightly profits thereby, and continues &s;o to do, will live in the exerci&s;e of the one true faith; will witne&s;s the one true chri&s;tian bap|ti&s;m; will know and obey the one living Lord; will, by the Holy Gho&s;t, in word and deed, acknowledge and call him Lord; and &s;o will be &s;aved with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation.

<P>After the meeting broke up at Camden, before we went away, we felt &s;uch an evident &s;top in our minds as to pur&s;uing our journey, and &s;uch de&s;ires to have another meeting at Camden, that we found peace in &s;ubmitting to it; and in order to procure the company of the bu&s;y inhabitants of the place, we con|cluded to &s;tay until fir&s;t-day, and gave notice accordingly. Then riding to our friend the widow Engli&s;h's, we re&s;ted there the next day; and the day following, that is, 7th-day, had an open precious meeting at a Bapti&s;t meeting-hou&s;e at Swift-Creek, among Bap|ti&s;ts and Methodi&s;ts, the Lord opening their hearts to receive our te&s;timony. The doc|trines of Truth were livingly declared, mo&s;t pre&s;ent were reached and tendered, and our &s;ouls relieved&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be the name of our God, who was eminently pre&s;ent!</P>
<P>Next day we attended the meeting we had appointed at Camden, a pretty many of the inhabitants were pre&s;ent, and though it ap|pears that there are not many religious per|&s;ons in the town, yet it was a day of precious vi&s;itation to many of their &s;ouls&mdash;a day to be remembered: Truth's doctrines were largely and with demon&s;tration opened and declared, making much impre&s;&s;ion on many minds. O, the preciou&s;ne&s;s of Truth! the &s;ufficiency of its aid, and never-failing victory when

abode in! Lie low, O my &s;oul, for ever; tru&s;t in the Lord; rely wholly on him; be nothing without him&mdash;all things in him; be faithful to him, and thou &s;halt never be con|founded.

Amen.</P>
<P>We lodged again after this meeting, at our &s;aid friend the widow Engli&s;h's; and next day, the 24th, took our journey for Charle&s;ton, where we arrived the 26th of 8th month, it being one hundred and twenty miles; and on 6th-day the 28th, we had a good little meeting at Friends meeting-hou&s;e with the few Friends in the city, and a few others that came in, and were tender. Next day we had a large meeting at the Methodi&s;ts meeting-hou&s;e; many Methodi&s;ts, &s;ome Bapti&s;ts, and others attending; but it was rather a dull time, and, not feeling our minds clear, we concluded to have another meeting there on fir&s;t-day afternoon.&mdash;In the forenoon on fir&s;t-day, we had a ble&s;&s;ed open time at Friends meeting-hou&s;e; and in the afternoon another large crowded meeting at the Me|thodi&s;t meeting-hou&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of a mixed and very un&s;ettled multitude. We found a pre&s;&s;ing engagement to declare the truth among them, but found them &s;o outward in their minds, and &s;o un&s;tayed, that we got very little entrance in their minds in gene|ral, or relief to our own, though I believe the Methodi&s;ts were mo&s;tly quiet, and &s;ome of
<PB N="236" REF="032810_0249_0FF52F23B3145AE0">
them, with a few others, were reached and tendered.</P>
<P>Second-day 31&s;t, We left the city with heavy hearts, after a &s;olid opportunity with Friends. This day and next we rode towards Georgia, about fifty-eight miles; and finding a little meeting of Friends, though not mem|bers, yet &s;uch as were convinced of Truth's way and principles; we &s;taid their meeting on fourth-day&mdash;it was dull at fir&s;t, but open and much favoured towards and in the con|clu&s;ion. Several Methodi&s;ts and Bapti&s;ts were pre&s;ent, and Truth reached and tendered mo&s;t of their minds. The&s;e friendly people had, at lea&s;t part of them, belonged to the Methodi&s;ts and Bapti&s;ts; but their eyes be|came gradually opened to &s;ee beyond lifele&s;s form and creaturely performances, as prayers in man's own time and will, &amp;c. and had now gathered into a &s;ilent waiting upon the Lord. May they live near him, love him, and &s;erve him in the beauty of holine&s;s: then they will not only enjoy great peace in them|&s;elves, but be a ble&s;&s;ing to their neighbours.</P>
<P>After meeting we went on for Georgia, and reached Friends monthly meeting at Wright&s;borough in that &s;tate, on 7th-day, 5th of 9th mo. It was a painful time; extreme poverty and inward want bore down our &s;ouls. We found a few words to drop among them, but &s;carce found any relief.&mdash;On fir&s;t-day the 6th, we had two favoured meetings: one at
<PB N="237" REF="032810_0250_0FF52FB9B4966AE8">
Wright&s;borough, and the other at Friends new meeting-hou&s;e, four or five miles from the fir&s;t; and next day were again at Wright&s;|borough, not being clear before; it was a precious time indeed, Truth's te&s;timony flow|ed with power, many were greatly reached, and &s;ome who had much oppo&s;ed our prin|ciples, acknowledged to the truth with tears, and de&s;ired us to remember them before the throne of grace&mdash;may they be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Third-day 8th, we had a large meeting at Marmaduke Mendenhall's, among a religious people, Methodi&s;ts, Bapti&s;ts, &amp;c. Truth emi|nently over&s;hadowed us. In our fir&s;t &s;itting down together, I had very bright openings, and fulne&s;s of light and life; but the meeting was hurt by the right time not being attended to in &s;tanding up, by me or my companion, or both&mdash;my &s;oul was grieved, for the people were prevented, in degree, enjoying what &s;eemed to be intended for them; yet many minds were affected, and I tru&s;t &s;ome good was done. Fourth-day 9th, we had a large meeting at a Friend's hou&s;e, among Method|i&s;ts, Bapti&s;ts and Friends. There was &s;trength and utterance given, and great indeed ap|peared to be the entrance into the people's minds. After this meeting, next day, we left Georgia, and &s;et out for South-Carolina. We got to a meeting among Friends at a place called Hender&s;on's Settlement, on fifth-day the 11th, and &s;o on to Mudlick, Bu&s;h River, Rocky-&s;pring, Paget's Creek and Cane Creek,
<PB N="238" REF="032810_0251_0FF52FCFDF68C968">
having a meeting at each of the&s;e places, and at Bu&s;h River <HI>two,</HI> mo&s;tly to a degree of &s;a|tisfaction, yet it appeared to be a low time among Friends in the&s;e parts; but dwelling low with the &s;uffering &s;eed, we were made to reign a little with it at times. The four fol|lowing days we rode to Deep Creek in North-Carolina, about one hundred and forty-three miles. At this place we had a meeting with Friends and others, on 3d-day the 22d, and &s;o on, having another at Che&s;nut Creek over the mountain in the edge of Virginia&mdash;thence back to &mdash; Freeman's, (not a Friend) in North-Carolina, having a meeting at his hou&s;e on 7th-day the 27th, and were next day at a Friends meeting at We&s;tfield, called al&s;o Tonis Creek&mdash;all the&s;e meetings were at|tended by Friends, Bapti&s;ts and Methodi&s;ts, and &s;ome of them by &s;ome others. And through patient waiting for the ari&s;ings of life and openings of light, they were all &s;olid profitable meetings; Truth's doctrines were largely opened, many minds reached, and the Lord's name exalted over all. Will-wor|&s;hip, creaturely performances, lifele&s;s prayers at &s;et times, &amp;c. were much di&s;couraged: for the Lord laid it upon me to expo&s;e the emp|tine&s;s of the&s;e things from place to place, and to &s;hew that they never fail of drying up the &s;prings of life in &s;uch, who once having had the fre&s;h openings thereof in their own &s;ouls, will yet go on in religious performances, with|out waiting for light and life therein.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="032810_0252_0FF52FD1C246C768">After one of the&s;e meetings, a Bapti&s;t man, &s;omewhat in years, told me he had tried to keep up family prayers in his hou&s;e, but found he could have no &s;atisfaction in it, unle&s;s when he felt a divine influence inclin|ing him thereto, and that he had now omit|ted it, except when he found him&s;elf thus qualified. Divers others have confe&s;&s;ed, that they had often, in their attempts to pray at their &s;et times, without waiting for divine help, evidently felt that their words fell to the ground, were of no avail, and an&s;wered no good purpo&s;e.&mdash;O that all may learn the nece&s;&s;ity of waiting upon God in the &s;ilence of all fle&s;h, and creaturely motions or per|formances, that they may witne&s;s that renew|al of divine &s;trength, wherein prayer is made with life and acceptance with the Lord.</P>
<P>I had much &s;ervice in the&s;e South Lands among other &s;ocieties, particularly Methodi&s;ts and Bapti&s;ts, there being a living birth among many of them; and this living birth, being in its very infancy in many of both the&s;e &s;ocieties, was near to my life, and I often breathed to the Lord to pre&s;erve it alive; for I &s;aw it to be in imminent danger of being &s;tifled by a multiplicity of lifele&s;s perform|ances. But though I was led into &s;ervice much among other people, as before-men|tioned, yet I generally, in the meetings of Friends, had &s;ome clear openings into the &s;tate of things among the brethren: for I was kept very low in my mind, and dur&s;t not
<PB N="240" REF="032810_0253_0FF52FD8CA5E82B0">
meddle with things not opened in the light of life. I was afraid to <HI>judge after the &s;ight of the eye, or reprove after the hearing of the ear;</HI> my dependance was on the Lord alone; and in that dependant &s;tate, I often felt as empty of any thing divine, any &s;ight, &s;en&s;e or know|ledge of things, as if I had been totally blind and in&s;en&s;ible&mdash;and indeed who is &s;o <HI>blind as the Lord's &s;ervant, and &s;o deaf as the me&s;&s;enger whom he &s;ends?</HI> And it is nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be &s;o, in order that his me&s;&s;age to the people through them may be wholly in the <HI>fre&s;h open|ings of divine life,</HI> without any mixture of man's fallen wi&s;dom. This is a great my&s;tery to the world and all its boa&s;ted wi&s;dom, and will remain &s;o for ever, though clearly opened unto babes and &s;ucklings in Chri&s;t. And as my mind abode in this <HI>low &s;tate,</HI> in the <HI>lo&s;s of all things,</HI> in the &s;ubjection of my own crea|turely will, wi&s;dom and workings; I received many fre&s;h openings, and therein was ena|bled to <HI>bring forth things new and old,</HI> to the in&s;truction, and, I hope, la&s;ting benefit of the brethren and many others from place to place. All glory and prai&s;e be a&s;cribed to him, with|out whom my poor &s;oul is nothing, knows nothing, and can do nothing, in things di|vine. O that all fle&s;h may be aba&s;ed, and lie low before him for ever, that his own eternal power may be exalted over all in them.</P>
<P>After this meeting at We&s;tfield, we found a pre&s;&s;ure in &s;pirit to have one next day among &s;ome religious Bapti&s;ts, about &s;ix miles off at
<PB N="241" REF="032810_0254_0FF52F22020F5FD0">
a Bapti&s;t man's hou&s;e; it was a precious hea|venly meeting, wherein Truth opened many things in the life and demon&s;tration. And &s;ome confe&s;&s;ed, they had never known be|fore, but that John's di&s;pen&s;ation of water-bapti&s;m was part of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, and to &s;tand to the end of time; but they &s;eemed now to be much &s;haken; for it was opened that John's elementary di&s;pen&s;ation was only a forerunning one, to prepare the way of the Lord. After this meeting we &s;till found a pre&s;&s;ing engagement to have another meeting at Friends meeting-hou&s;e at We&s;t|field, which was held accordingly the next day, to great &s;atisfaction: many Bapti&s;ts and others, as well as many Friends, attended&mdash; Truth reigned over all, and the doctrines thereof <HI>dropped as the rain,</HI> to the tendering and refre&s;hing many &s;eeking &s;ouls&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for all his favours. We next had meetings at Blues-Creek, and Muddy-Creek, and on fir&s;t and &s;econd days the 4th and 5th of the 10th month, were at Deep-River, their large monthly meeting being held there on &s;econd-day&mdash;all the&s;e were ble&s;&s;ed watering &s;ea&s;ons; the monthly meeting abundantly &s;o, to the bowing my &s;oul in awfulne&s;s and prai&s;e. On 3d-day we had an open, refre&s;hing meet|ing among the Nicholites, &s;o called. I had a lively evidence that &s;ome among them were humbly endeavouring to &s;erve the Lord; but at the &s;ame time I &s;aw clearly that many of them re&s;ted too much in their out&s;ide plain|ne&s;s; and valuing them&s;elves upon that, had
<PB N="242" REF="032810_0255_0FF52FE1C6E3A818">
&s;topped &s;hort of a more living acquaintance with the well-&s;pring of eternal life; and this is a &s;nare wherein I fear &s;ome of our &s;ociety are taken, and detained from greater experi|ence in the real life of religion, without which all outward things are unavailing, as to the &s;alvation of the &s;oul. I laboured among this people, in the openings of life, and hope ac|cording to their condition&mdash;may it tend to their &s;ettlement on the right foundation!&mdash; Then, proceeding on our journey, we had meetings at Friends meeting-hou&s;es at Spring|field, Bulrun, New-Garden, Lower Reedy-Fork, and Upper Reedy-Fork, all favoured meetings, &s;ome of them highly &s;o.</P>
<P>On 4th-day the 14th, we had a meeting at the hou&s;e of our friend Samuel Tomlin&s;on, where very few Friends live near, among Bapti&s;ts, Methodi&s;ts, &s;ome Friends, &amp;c. We evidently felt that &s;ome of them had pitched in battle array again&s;t us in their minds; and for a time the Lord &s;uffered them to &s;hut up the kingdom of heaven, not entering them|&s;elves, nor &s;uffering tho&s;e that gladly would have entered. At length a &s;mall degree of life aro&s;e, and I told them the battle was the Lord's, and if he &s;uffered them to &s;hut up the kingdom, the lo&s;s would be their own; but that it was likely tho&s;e formerly, who&s;e un|belief prevented our Saviour's doing many mighty works in certain places, might be rea|dy to vaunt over him, and to think he could not make his way among them; and yet I
<PB N="243" REF="032810_0256_0FF52F5C2492B390">
thought their victory, if &s;uch they e&s;teemed it, was in no wi&s;e glorious; but greatly to their own lo&s;s, or the prevention of much good that they might otherwi&s;e have receiv|ed. I then acknowledged to them freely, that we had nothing at our own command to offer for their good; nor any weapons of our own to oppo&s;e their warlike preparations with&mdash; told them I had little thought, when in the pure con&s;trainings of go&s;pel love and good will, I gave up to have a meeting with them, that they would have come together prepared for war; but that I was a&s;&s;ured it was &s;o, for I could feel the inward &s;tate and oppo&s;ition of &s;ome of their minds, as plain as I could &s;ee their bodies with my outward eyes.&mdash; Moreover I informed them, that if the Lord engaged me in it, I was not afraid or a&s;hamed to fight, even upon a retreat, if he did not make way for an advance&mdash;that I was not at all afraid of my life, how many Goliaths &s;oe|ver might defy the armies of the living God; for my life I had given up to his di&s;po&s;al, to be laid down in his cau&s;e, if he plea&s;ed, in any part of the globe.&mdash;I came not from my own land, and all my near and dear connec|tions in life, to do my own will, but his who &s;ent me; and while I &s;tand faithful in his holy will and coun&s;el, in the openings and leadings of his divine light and life, I fear no evil, danger or difficulty; nor all the art and malice of men or devils; though I fully know that of my&s;elf I can do nothing. However I told them, for their own &s;akes, in order that
<PB N="244" REF="032810_0257_0FF52F5DC8BB88E0">
they might have the full benefit of the meet|ing, I de&s;ired them to lay a&s;ide their warlike weapons, that inward oppo&s;ition wherein they &s;tood again&s;t the inward life of all true reli|gion, and the doctrines of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel; and as they knew them&s;elves guilty of an inward oppo&s;ition to us and our me&s;|&s;age, it began to work conviction in them: they wondered how I knew it; but &s;eeing I did know it, and was enabled &s;o plainly to tell them the inward &s;tate, and thoughts of their own hearts, it won upon them, drew their attention, removed their prejudices, and &s;oftened their hearts towards us and our te&s;ti|mony&mdash;and when I found they had given up, and dropt their warlike weapons and inten|tions, I improved the opportunity, as Truth opened the way, and told them, I perceived they began to incline towards a capitulation, and willingne&s;s to &s;ign articles of peace&mdash;this they al&s;o knew was true of the inward alter|ation of their minds; and &s;o it greatly tended &s;till further to gain their love and attention, until at length (though the work, or rather warfare, was very hard for &s;ome time) we had an heavenly baptizing time together&mdash;Truth reigned over all, and therein our &s;ouls tri|umphed over all oppo&s;ition, in the &s;trength and power of an endle&s;s life! wherein divers doctrines of the go&s;pel were livingly opened and enlarged upon, in demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and divine authority! yea, that was felt and acknowledged to be &s;o, by many who&s;e hearts were greatly tendered and refre&s;hed,
<PB N="245" REF="032810_0258_0FF52FE35AB53C08">
after all the oppo&s;ition they had at fir&s;t felt again&s;t us. Thus the Lord wrought for us, and taught <HI>our</HI> hands to war, and our fingers to fight&mdash;Glory be to his great name for ever! for hitherto he hath marvellou&s;ly helped us; and we know that without him we mu&s;t have turned our backs in this and many other days of battle.</P>
<P>Next day we had a heavenly open meeting at a Bapti&s;t meeting-hou&s;e on Abbit's Creek, about ten miles from the la&s;t meeting&mdash;divers of their members, and one of their teachers urgingly de&s;iring us to have a meeting with them there, they being much reached at the other meeting. We had had thoughts of having a meeting there before this invitation, and, the way now looking very open, we em|braced it, and had one accordingly. And as &s;oon as I &s;at down in the meeting, I felt as evidently as I ever felt any thing with my outward fingers, that they were now come without their weapons, in a &s;tate of mind di|rectly rever&s;e to what they or &s;ome of them felt in the fore part of the meeting ye&s;terday; their hearts were open, and our way was al&s;o &s;oon opened into a living enlargement in the doctrines of Truth, I tru&s;t to our and their mutual &s;atisfaction and con&s;olation of &s;oul, though their outward performances and life|le&s;s devotions were largely and livingly te&s;ti|fied again&s;t.&mdash;Our next meeting was on the day following at Randolph Court-hou&s;e, among people of various profe&s;&s;ions; and,

And on 6th-day the 1&s;t of 1&s;t month 1790, I went to a place called Wright's Ferry, on the river Su&s;quehanna, where I had a pretty good meeting at the widow Wright's hou&s;e&mdash;and the three next days, three ble&s;&s;ed meetings at Lanca&s;ter, Lampeter and Sad&s;bury; then on 3d-day the 5th, another &s;uch at Ea&s;t Not|tingham in Maryland,&mdash;Next day another &s;uch at We&s;t Nottingham in Maryland&mdash;and the day following another at Little-Britain in Penn&s;ylvania; and on 6th-day the 8th, a ble&s;&s;ed and very open one at Deer-Creek, over Su&s;quehanna in Maryland.&mdash;On fir&s;t-day the 10th, through deep &s;uffering, I was con&s;iderably opened and enlarged in the &s;ore

<P>Next day I had a meeting at the Bay-&s;ide; it was &s;ilent and dull for a long time; after which my mouth was opened in the pure go&s;pel &s;pring, and the meeting continued &s;ome con&s;iderable length of time longer, in a very open and relieving manner; the nature of go&s;pel wor&s;hip and of all real go&s;pel mini|&s;try, being largely opened to the people&mdash;may it fa&s;ten as a nail in a &s;ure place. Oh! how I have mourned before the Lord, under a &s;en&s;e of the death and formality which reigns in Chri&s;tendom! for want of waiting for divine help, and through pu&s;hing forward in man's time and ability, which brings forth but a form of godline&s;s and devotion, without the life and power of it.</P>
<P>On 1&s;t-day the 31&s;t, I had a very large and highly favoured meeting at Third-Haven, among the inhabitants of the town, many of whom had not been at any of the preceding meetings there. Go&s;pel light &s;hined emi|nently among us, and I hope and believe in|&s;truction was &s;ealed on &s;ome minds pre&s;ent, in a manner not ea&s;ily to be era&s;ed.&mdash;The two next days we had meetings at Choptank and Mar&s;hy-Creek, both precious &s;ea&s;ons after long waiting.&mdash;The two days following the&s;e, we were at meeting with the Nicholites (&s;o

<P>After this we went into Delaware &s;tate, and had meetings at our friend Baptis Lay's at Cold Spring, Lewis-Town, Three-Runs, Mother-kill, Frederico and Mother-kill again. We were helped through to profit and relief in them all; though mo&s;tly in a way much to the &s;ubjection of our own creaturely wills. Oh! what need there is to lie low, and ri&s;e only as the pure life ari&s;es, le&s;t we be found offering &s;trange fire, or lifting up a tool on the Lord's altar.&mdash;Contentment in a lowly &s;tate, and moving on gently in the real nece&s;|&s;ity, is highly acceptable to him, without whom we can do nothing. Here we acknow|ledge his might, his right to command even faithfulne&s;s in the little, which fails not, if we rightly obey, to make us, in his own time, rulers over much; and &s;ometimes to our own great admiration.&mdash;Indeed it was &s;o in &s;everal of the&s;e meetings&mdash;that at Lewis-Town and that at Frederico being times of high favour: the people were mo&s;tly not of our &s;ociety, no meeting of Friends being u&s;ually held at either place. Al&s;o the meetings at Mother-kill were, in the end, &s;ea&s;ons of enlargement, though through difficulty, hard labour, and clo&s;e in|ward attention; e&s;pecially the la&s;t, wherein the Lord eminently evinced to us, beyond all room for doubt, that when he opens, none

<P>HAVING thus performed the &s;ervice required of me in the &s;outhern &s;tates, I pa&s;&s;ed near three years at and about home; and had, as u&s;ual, many clo&s;e trials and be|&s;etments to pa&s;s through from time to time, until in the 7th month 1791, it plea&s;ed the Mo&s;t High to prove me in a very near and heart-exerci&s;ing manner, in the removal by death of my dearly beloved wife.

<P>I thought before my wife's &s;ickne&s;s, it was very doubtful whether I &s;hould ever get &s;afely through my many be&s;etments: but alas! in the mid&s;t of the&s;e trials, it plea&s;ed the Lord to take from me the dear partner of joys,

<P>31&s;t of 1&s;t mo. I took a &s;olemn leave of the family (that is, my father-in-law Daniel Anthony's) living in my hou&s;e, and in who&s;e family I left my own father, and my two younge&s;t children: and being joined by my friend David Buffum, (Amos Collins and Benedict Arnold having given up to bear us company) we were on 5th day of the 2d mo. at the new meeting-hou&s;e in Glouce&s;ter, on our way towards Connecticut, and had meet|ings as follows, viz.&mdash;7th, at Killingley, had a &s;mall meeting at &mdash; Dean's; 9th, at Da|vid Brayton's in Pomfret; 12th, attended Friends meeting at Hopkinton; 14th, had one by appointment at Amos Collins's, my way having been hitherto much clo&s;ed up as to go&s;pel mini&s;try, my companion D. B. having a little to offer at times, I tru&s;t, to good accept|ance; 16th, we had a good open meeting at Stonington Point, and another in the even|ing; 17th, went to New-London, and 18th, had a &s;mall meeting there in the congrega|tional meeting-hou&s;e; 19th, had a meeting among the Bapti&s;ts at New-London Great-Neck, found but little relief in the&s;e la&s;t meetings, though hope they were of &s;ome u&s;e; 20th, had an evening meeting at Lime, in a &s;chool-hou&s;e&mdash;The people were un&s;ettled, and appeared much unacquainted with &s;pi|ritual

wor&s;hip&mdash;we laboured a little among them; and, 21&s;t, cro&s;&s;ed Connecticut river, by boat, and not without &s;ome danger in the ice, and went to Saybrook; 22d, had a meeting here in the meeting-hou&s;e&mdash;the prie&s;t attended, and a con&s;iderable number of his hearers, and neither he nor his hearers ap|peared to be much acquainted with our man|ner of waiting upon God in a &s;ilent travail of &s;oul, and feeling after him. We laboured among them according to the ability received. After meeting he inclined to have &s;ome con|ver&s;ation, and we, being willing, conver&s;ed with him on divers religious &s;ubjects. He was civil; and we parted friendly and re&s;|pectfully.</P>
<P>23d. We rode through Killing&s;worth to Guilford, where, 24th, we had a &s;oul-&s;olacing meeting; among tho&s;e who attended, were divers religiou&s;ly exerci&s;ed &s;ouls, who&s;e coun|tenances declared they had been with Je&s;us. 25th, had another good meeting in a &s;chool-hou&s;e at Wallingford. After meeting divers of the people came to our lodgings, and we had con&s;iderable conver&s;ation with them. A phy&s;ician contended earne&s;tly for the final &s;alvation of all men. We told him none could be di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, but &s;uch as took up their daily cro&s;s and followed him, in the de|nial of &s;elf; that he wept over &s;ome, who, though he <HI>would</HI> have gathered them, they <HI>would not;</HI> that, though many &s;hould come from the ea&s;t, we&s;t, north and &s;outh, and &s;it

Fir&s;t of 3d month, had an appointed meet|ing at Go&s;hen, at our friend Charles Richards afore&s;aid; it was a precious open meeting; after which we rode to Canaan, and, 2d, to Hud&s;on, in New-York &s;tate. 4th, attended Friends meeting there. 7th-day, the Creek

In this journey I rode, by the account I kept, 488 miles&mdash;a painful exerci&s;ing journey it has been; but a good degree of patience was afforded us.&mdash; 28th, contented in a low &s;tate, in our month|ly meeting. I am yet weak,&mdash;Lord help, help my &s;oul, and give it &s;tability.</P>
<P>31&s;t, I opened in our &s;elect meeting a con|cern that had been about 14 years ripening in my mind, to pay a religious vi&s;it to Friends in Europe. My heart had of late been pre&s;&s;ingly full of it, as a ve&s;&s;el wanting vent. Friends left me at liberty to move the matter in our monthly meeting, when I might feel the way open for it. They were feelingly dipt into a &s;en&s;e of the travail of my exerci&s;ed &s;oul, and Truth was prevalent. 4th month 11th, I laid before the meeting for &s;ufferings a treati&s;e I had written on bapti&s;m. 25th, opened my concern to make a vi&s;it to Europe in our monthly meeting. 6th month 6th, attended the fir&s;t &s;itting of our yearly meeting, which continued until the 12th. It was a very com|fortable yearly meeting: much unity, con|cord and love prevailed throughout. 6th mo. 27th, in our monthly meeting, I a&s;ked for,

and obtained a certificate to pay a &s;mall debt, by a vi&s;it within Salem quarterly meeting, and, 30th, &s;et out on &s;aid vi&s;it into that quarter, and rode as far as Bo&s;ton, and, fir&s;t day of the week, and 1&s;t of 7th month, attended meeting there&mdash;&s;ilent&mdash;the meeting &s;mall; yet I hoped Truth's te&s;timony was not quite lo&s;t among them. May a revival take place, and Truth yet pro&s;per there. Rode to Lynn, and&punc; 2d of the month, had a meeting there: the way not very open; but I laboured in weakne&s;s. There is a number of panting &s;ouls in that place. 3d, had a laborious meet|ing at Salem; found &s;ome relief. 4th, had a pretty open meeting at Newbury. 5th and 6th. was at Alm&s;bury and Seabrook; pain|fully exerci&s;ed in both. 7th, 8th and 10th, was at Dover, Berwick and Wyndham; had a good meeting at the la&s;t place, and returned to Falmouth. 11th. attended the meeting there; it was a clo&s;e, &s;earching, laborious time. 12th, had a good open rejoicing meet|ing at Durham&punc; and rode from thence to Bath. 13th, had a very trying meeting there; my mind was deeply &s;en&s;ible, though an en|tire &s;tranger, that there was either a wolf or wolves among us, in &s;heep's clothing; the which gave me much and long painful, in|ward labour, and al&s;o lengthy vocal exerci&s;e. The te&s;timony of the word of life I felt as a flame again&s;t antichri&s;t in the temple of God, again&s;t likene&s;&s;es in religion; forms without &s;ub&s;tance; words without life and power: at length my &s;pirit was clear and ea&s;y, and after

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Account of his voyage to Europe.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 26th day of the 11th month, 1792, I took a &s;olemn leave of my dear father, father and mother-in-law, my two younge&s;t children, whom I left in their care, and of my brothers and &s;i&s;ters-in-law, and accompa|nied by my kind friends Thomas Arnold and Smith Brown, went to Bo&s;ton. 27th, the &s;hip not ready to &s;ail, I made &s;ome prepa|rations for the voyage. 29th, my two &s;aid friends returning home, I attended the meet|ing in Bo&s;ton which was &s;mall; I had howe|ver a few words of invitation for them. 30th, I went to Lynn, and 1&s;t of the 12th month, vi&s;ited divers families there; and 2d, attended their large meeting in &s;ilence; 3d, returned to Bo&s;ton; 4th, wrote letters home; and 5th, went on board the &s;hip Mercury of 240 tons, bound for Dunkirk, Benjamin Glover, of Nantucket, ma&s;ter. We &s;ailed about noon: &s;ome time in the afternoon we lo&s;t &s;ight of Bo&s;ton. In the night all hands were called up, and the &s;hip put about in order to return to the harbour, &s;he leaking, and the leak ra|pidly increa&s;ing, that is, from the rate of one hundred &s;trokes of the pump an hour to &s;ix hundred. The captain, mates and crew, were alarmed; but &s;he &s;oon leaked le&s;s on this tack, and they put about again.&mdash;6th, the &s;hip &s;till leaking, the captain and &s;everal men &s;earched
<PB N="301" REF="032810_0314_0FF530BF4AFACA80">
on the out&s;ide for the leak, but &s;ound none; after which, the leak moderating, cheerful|ne&s;s returned in the faces of the company.</P>
<P>7th, the leak greatly increa&s;ed, to near one thou&s;and &s;trokes an hour. Sadne&s;s again re|&s;umed its empire over the crew. The captain knew not what to do; at length he put about again, and &s;ailed homeward a while. The weather was pretty rugged during the time of this increa&s;ing leak. The leak con|tinuing, the captain ordered a hole to be cut through the &s;econd deck to go in and &s;earch for it, which was done, and the leak &s;oon found, to wit, an open auger-hole of about an inch and an half, at the &s;hip's &s;tem, &s;o high up as not to leak con&s;tantly, which being &s;topped, the number of &s;trokes were &s;oon re|duced to twenty-five an hour. Oh! what a change this wrought in the countenances of the poor &s;ailors. They &s;oon &s;eemed as if they had forgot all their &s;orrows. They put &s;hip about, and now &s;eemed as if they were going to &s;ea in earne&s;t. The captain's looks proclaim|ed the relief of his heart, though he was mo|derate through all. My tru&s;t was only in God my hope, refuge and defence. I ap|pealed to him who knew all hearts, that he knew my motives in this voyage were none other than that I might be found obedient to his holy call, and faithful in his &s;ervice; and if it was now his will to &s;uffer my body to de|&s;cend into a watery grave, 'thy will be done.' was the hone&s;t language of my heart. I could
<PB N="302" REF="032810_0315_0FF530EA3A2F08E8">
not wi&s;h my&s;elf on &s;hore, nor on board an|other ve&s;&s;el; for I had felt quite ea&s;y in tak|ing pa&s;&s;age in this, and remained &s;o. I be|lieved the winds and waves obeyed him, and that his providential care is over all his crea|tures. I felt &s;afe in his hand, and repo&s;ed my&s;elf as in the hollow of it&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be his name for ever.</P>
<P>8th, all cheerful on board. The motion of the &s;hip has kept me a little &s;ea-&s;ick.&mdash;9th, cloudy and rainy.&mdash;I &s;at a while in &s;olemn &s;ilence, waiting upon the Lord my God; but though my mind was &s;omewhat &s;tayed, it was inwardly as outwardly, a cloudy time, indeed a time of deep proving to me.&mdash;10th, At even|ing the wind aro&s;e, and roared tremendou&s;ly; it held all night: the men tied up the &s;ails, la&s;h|ed the helm, and let the &s;hip drift in the wind and waves.&mdash;11th, the gale &s;till continued all the la&s;t night, and all this day and night with vi|olence. The captain &s;aid this morning he had not, for eight years pa&s;t, known &s;o terrible a time, for &s;o long continuance, though that was but about the middle of it: and indeed it was con&s;iderably more violent the night following than at all before. It &s;tormed through the whole; but this night the &s;torm and tempe&s;t of wind was dreadful. The &s;hip was bound on a whaling voyage from Dun|kirk, and for that purpo&s;e had boats on board. One of the&s;e was con&s;iderably da&s;hed to pieces this night: three or four yards or &s;pars were lo&s;t: &s;everal fowls died, and the
<PB N="303" REF="032810_0316_0FF530EBD92C7158">
only live &s;heep we had on board came near dying, even under deck. I felt re&s;igned through all; and, though poor in &s;pirit, I never wi&s;hed my&s;elf el&s;ewhere, or in any wi&s;e repented my voyage. I &s;aw God's wonders in the deep, and it would almo&s;t &s;eem at times as if the briny waves might prevail again&s;t us&mdash;though I cannot &s;ay there was a moment wherein I really lo&s;t my confidence.</P>
<P>I had &s;teadily, for many months, firmly expected and believed I &s;hould &s;ee wonders on the mighty waters. My God had &s;ealed it on my &s;oul, that the loud roar of winds and the dread rolling of the waves &s;hould awfully attend my pa&s;&s;age, and prove my hold on heaven. And, therefore, when the time of trial came, I &s;aid in my heart, it is the Lord, let him fulfil his purpo&s;es: let him do what he will with me: nought be&s;ides his holy will can be good for me; and why &s;hould I wi&s;h even the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable parts of it averted, mitigated or even &s;hortened? I believed I had had his holy promi&s;e who can|not lie, that I &s;hould live through the&s;e dread|ful to&s;&s;ings on the bo&s;om of the ocean, and once more &s;et my foot on firm ground; yea, ble&s;s his holy name, in wonders yet to come on &s;hore. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his pro&s;pect.</NOTE> I cannot &s;ay I was not nearly proved in regard to his divine &s;uperinten|dency, nor that I did not almo&s;t doubt the certainty of his in&s;poken word of promi&s;e to my &s;oul, though I well remembered the clear|ne&s;s
<PB N="304" REF="032810_0317_0FF53038C5F6A838">
of the pro&s;pect, and the holy warmth and energy that did livingly attend the &s;ame, months before. And though the evidence of divine things was very low in my mind, yet I could not ca&s;t away my confidence, being &s;till per&s;uaded, that, if I had ever known the holy word at all, I had had it in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. Here my foot fixed, and my all I &s;till &s;urrendered up to his di&s;po&s;al, who is God over all for ever.</P>
<P>12th. About noon the wind and &s;torm was &s;o far abated that the captain had the &s;hip under &s;ail again, though &s;till the roar of ele|ments remained. 13th, It is &s;till cloudy and rainy. The &s;un has been &s;een but little &s;ince we left Bo&s;ton; and I think it has rained or &s;nowed, more or le&s;s, every day and night but one. 14th, Very little &s;un&s;hine&mdash;&s;ome rain. 15th, Rainy all day, at night it cleared up, and gave us to hope for &s;ettled and com|fortable weather; but 16th, it &s;tormed again, and &s;nowed plentifully; but at night it clear|ed off. 17th, Stormy again. We had &s;ound|ings on the grand banks of Newfoundland at forty fathoms; but little wind for two or three days. Afternoon cleared up &s;o plea|&s;antly, that great hopes were entertained of having good weather. 18th, Forenoon &s;tor|my with but little wind, the &s;torm continued until near night; then the wind &s;pringing up fre&s;h and fair, it cleared away. The captain &s;aid he had not been able to get but one good ob&s;ervation during our being at &s;ea, &s;o little
<PB N="305" REF="032810_0318_0FF52FE4F28AD3D8">
&s;un&s;hine have we had for this almo&s;t two weeks. But my &s;oul is &s;atisfied in the divine di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>19th. Fair weather and a good fre&s;h breeze. We now &s;eem to look forward with cheerful|ne&s;s. 20th and 21&s;t, a very good breeze continued mo&s;t of the&s;e days. 22d, this day a good fre&s;h breeze at S. W. the weather cloudy; but the cloud over my mind is in degree di&s;pelled; ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord.&mdash;Lord, hold me in thy holy hand, and make me ever truly watchful, thankful, and &s;teadfa&s;tly believing. Amen. 23d, we are &s;till favoured with a good lively breeze, and make good way a-head. 24th, the &s;ame as ye&s;terday; during the la&s;t night I got very little &s;leep; (though this is u&s;ual with me on this voyage) yet in mo&s;t fervent interce&s;&s;ions I be&s;ought the Lord to be with me through all. 25th, 26th and 27th, &s;till good winds. O the wonders of the rolling foaming deep! If the Lord's hand was not underneath, we &s;hould &s;urely &s;ink beneath the raging waves! Who can be an athei&s;t? or what can be an athei&s;t's hope? 28th, a very good lively wind, cloudy and &s;mall rains. La&s;t night, a night of angui&s;h to my proved &s;oul. All for|mer experience cannot prevent renewals of un&s;peakable anxiety, when the Lord is plea&s;|ed to prove his own as 'at Ma&s;&s;ah,' and to '&s;trive with them (in his own way) as at the waters of Meribah.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xvii. 7.</NOTE> 29th, an excellent wind,

cloudy and wet.&mdash;The mariners ca&s;t the lead, found &s;oundings at about 90 fathoms. 30th, fair wind and weather. It was agreed on board, that this morning, when the &s;un was about two hours and an half high, that we had not had &s;o much fair weather at a time, &s;ince we left Bo&s;ton, as this morning. 31&s;t, in the morning found &s;ixty fathom water; we were now abrea&s;t Scilly i&s;lands according to our calculations. This afternoon we &s;aw the Li|zard. Fre&s;h wind and cloudy. Thus ends the year 1792.</P>
<P>1&s;t of the 1&s;t month 1793. The wind in|crea&s;ed from a good fre&s;h breeze, to a &s;trong gale&mdash;&s;aw land divers times this day, and a number of &s;hips going up and down the En|gli&s;h channel. 2d, almo&s;t calm. Thus, after a &s;torm, comes a calm. May my &s;oul take courage to weather out the yet remaining &s;torms of life, in con&s;ideration that, now and then, it will be calm; and in full hope of a &s;afe entrance ere long, and eternal calm abode in the haven of immortal bli&s;s; as we are now, I tru&s;t, about entering in a few days our outward port. 3d, in the morning we were off Calais cliffs, almo&s;t becalmed, gain|ed no ground all day. 4th. after beating to and fro all night, ju&s;t in by the land near Calais, we took a pilot on board from there this morning, and tried to work up the &s;traits, but made little advance&punc; by rea&s;on of contra|ry winds and tides. We lay at anchor this night between Calais and Dunkirk.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="032810_0320_0FF531355E828FE8">5th, Got within about four miles of Dun|kirk harbour; could get no further, &s;o ca&s;t anchor again. But being de&s;irous to be with the few Friends at Dunkirk next day at meet|ing, I went on board the pilot boat, among coar&s;e uncouth Flemmings, and a French|man or two, all &s;trangers, and got &s;afe a&s;hore, and &s;oon to the hou&s;e of my dear friend Wil|liam Rotch and family, of Nantucket, now re&s;ident here at Dunkirk in French Flanders, where I met a very cordial reception. My &s;oul bowed in thankfulne&s;s to I&s;rael's God, who&s;e unfailing Arm had thus far borne up, and who&s;e goodne&s;s &s;o far had fulfilled his holy word, as to bring me &s;afe through all to &s;hore. 6th, I &s;at with the few Friends of this place, in their meeting, and rejoiced in the divine pre&s;ence, of which my enjoyment was greater than at any time during my whole pa&s;&s;age from America. My way opening in a &s;mall te&s;timony, my &s;oul was relieved and prai&s;ed God, on the banks of deliverance, both outward and inward.</P>
<P>7th. Wrote letters home to my friends. 8th and 9th, vi&s;ited &s;ome families. Dear Robert Grubb, of Ireland, came here from Paris the la&s;t evening. 13th, I found a good degree of relief in the publick meeting; but became much more thoroughly relieved in an evening meeting which we found a con|cern to hold, at the &s;ixth hour. The meeting-place being filled by Friends and others; it was a good time; and at the clo&s;e we had a

<P>20th. At the fore and afternoon meetings, and an evening &s;itting at the hou&s;e of my dear friend Richard Baker, with a pretty large number of Friends, I had full opportunity to become relieved in mind in regard to the deep travail of &s;pirit which I felt for Friends of this place: May they live loo&s;e to the world, and &s;eparate from its beguiling friend|&s;hips and influence. 21&s;t and 22d, much un|well with a cold, and a deep heavy cough, &s;o

It was a good time, and we returned in the even|ing. 8th, attended the meeting for &s;ufferings. 9th, We vi&s;ited divers Friends families. 10th, We attended in the forenoon the Park meet|ing, and in the afternoon that at Hor&s;eley|down; in both the Lord dealt bountifully with us, Truth ri&s;ing over all, and we may thank|fully &s;ay, 'hitherto the Lord hath helped us.' 11th, Found relief in clearing my mind in a good degree in the &s;elect meeting. 12th, We attended the monthly meeting at Hor&s;eley|down. 13th, I rejoiced in Truth's victory over death, in a meeting at the &s;chool-hou&s;e for Friends at Peel meeting. Al&s;o on 14th, at the monthly meeting at We&s;tmin&s;ter. 15th, Had a hard cold and cough; kept hou&s;e. 16th and 17th, Still unwell. 18th, I got out though weak to the &s;elect morning meeting. 19th, We went out to Barking monthly meet|ing held at Pla&s;to, about four or five miles from London. 20th, attended Peel monthly meet|ing, where I was much clo&s;ed up except in di&s;cipline. 21&s;t, that at Ratcliff, much in the &s;ame way. 22d, attended the &s;chool meeting at I&s;lington, and the meeting for &s;ufferings:

<P>I may here mention, my mind has been deeply affected under &s;ome &s;erious con&s;idera|tions of the &s;tate of things in the world, and particularly in this nation. What a number of men are there who a&s;&s;ume the &s;tation of go&s;pel mini&s;ters; and, under that pretence, drain and even violently force away from the proper owners large &s;ums of money, which
<PB N="312" REF="032810_0325_0FF5305693B5FD70">
they do very little to earn!&mdash;Even if it were right to preach for hire, and if Chri&s;t's true mini&s;ters could freely and righteou&s;ly receive money for their mini&s;try, (which they by no means can) yet to &s;ee a &s;et of almo&s;t idle drones living on the hone&s;t labours of the in|du&s;trious, as great numbers of the upper cler|gy do, whil&s;t they not only thus oppre&s;s ma|ny poor laymen, as they choo&s;e to call them, but al&s;o pre&s;s down to a very low price and poor living, even many of the lower clergy who do the work for them, as if a mini&s;ter of Je&s;us could have his work done and his mi|ni&s;try performed faithfully in the &s;ight of God, by hiring another to preach for him, and with money extorted from tho&s;e it properly and hone&s;tly belongs to, while them&s;elves live in luxury and at ea&s;e, in their ceiled hou&s;es, and but &s;eldom vi&s;it their flock; the pro&s;pect of the&s;e things is deeply affecting.</P>
<P>Oh! mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the land mourns, and God is angry becau&s;e of the&s;e things, and in &s;ome way or other he will ari&s;e and &s;hake the earth, and al&s;o this fal&s;e heaven&mdash;this vain and oppre&s;&s;ive mini&s;try, and rend the power from the idle, lordly clergy. But whatever be the means, &s;o that it is in the pure coun|&s;el of God, my very &s;oul breathes to the Al|mighty, that he may, in the way of his own good plea&s;ure, ha&s;ten the downfall even of prote&s;tant Babylon; rend the power of the idle, u&s;ele&s;s clergy, and thus emancipate the people from the bondage and oppre&s;&s;ion they
<PB N="313" REF="032810_0326_0FF53071E01E55F8">
groan under, that the earth may enjoy her &s;abbaths again. But how the&s;e deeply to be pitied, the&s;e too worthle&s;s, too worldly, and too cruel pretenders to the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; or how tho&s;e civil rulers&punc; who, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of aggrandize|ment and power, &s;upport them; will be able to &s;ettle their accounts in the great day of the Lord, the &s;olemn &s;ettlement of all things, is a con&s;ideration truly awful!</P>
<P>If the&s;e hints are ever publi&s;hed, let not delicacy prevail to affect any unnece&s;&s;ary mi|tigation of the clo&s;e expre&s;&s;ions in which they are couched. It is time the&s;e deceivers of men, the&s;e dark bodies, who form an eclip&s;e between God and the &s;ouls of men, &s;hould hear and &s;eriou&s;ly hearken to the voice of plain, hone&s;t and undi&s;gui&s;ed truth. And whether they will hearken and hear, yea or nay, let them be a&s;&s;ured God is ari&s;ing, and will &s;hake and remove them out of the way; and their domination &s;hall be remembered with abhorrence!</P>
<P>3d of 3d mo. We had a good open meet|ing at Pla&s;to. 4th, I had &s;olid relief in the &s;elect morning meeting there, through deep dwelling and plain dealing: may the Lord fa&s;ten it as a nail in a &s;ure place. 5th, we attended the monthly meeting at Devon&s;hire-Hou&s;e. 6th, that at Grace-Church-Street. 7th, that at Tottenham; in all which I had &s;olid &s;atisfaction; as al&s;o at an evening meet|ing
<PB N="314" REF="032810_0327_0FF53149EFBCEAB0">
which I was concerned to appoint on the 8th, at &s;aid Tottenham: general notice was given, and it was a large crowded meeting, many not of our &s;ociety attending. It was long &s;ilent; but after that, Truth's doctrines were largely opened and declared to the peo|ple, who behaved very commendably, and were remarkably &s;till and quiet, through the long &s;ilence, and to the clo&s;e of the meeting.</P>
<P>9th, I vi&s;ited divers families, and therein had peace. 10th, attended meeting fore and afternoon at Tottenham. 11th, the &s;elect morning meeting at Grace-Church-Street; and 12th, the meeting at Devon&s;hire-Hou&s;e; all to &s;olid &s;atisfaction in the Lord. 13th, we attended the monthly meeting at Stains, &s;eventeen miles from London; and next day their particular meeting at the &s;ame place; in both which Truth reigned over all: thanks be unto God who gave the victory. Many not of our &s;ociety, being notified, attended the la&s;t meeting: and I believe &s;ome of them were, through the openings of divine life, &s;olidly in&s;tructed and &s;olemnized in &s;pirit. 15th, we had a good open meeting at Long-ford, and, on 16th, another at Uxbrigde&punc; 17th. one at Brentford, and in the evening one at Hammer&s;mith&mdash;all favoured meetings; though many of the people's views and ex|pectations being too much outward cau&s;ed the &s;pring to be long &s;hut up in &s;everal of them.&mdash;This may be &s;trange doctrine to &s;ome; but &s;ome others know that the &s;pring

mu&s;t be opened in the hearer, or el&s;e there can be but little profitably done by the &s;peak|er.

But when the &s;pring is livingly opened in him that &s;peaketh, and in tho&s;e that hear, then it is that <Q>deep calleth unto deep, at the &s;ound of the water&s;pouts</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xlii. 7.</NOTE> of life, and here in&s;truction is &s;ealed.</P>
<P>After the&s;e meetings we rode to London, and were affectionately received by our dear friend John Elliot, his wife and children&punc; 18th, we again attended the &s;elect morning meeting in the city, to a degree of &s;atisfaction. 19th, we were at monthly meeting at Bark|ing. 20th, at a meeting appointed at Pla&s;to; and, on 21&s;t, at their meeting at Barking; all affording &s;ome con&s;olation. 22d, we at|tended the meeting for &s;ufferings at London. 23d, I wrote letters home, and went out to Wand&s;worth. 24th, the word of the Lord was powerful through me, a poor in&s;tru|ment, to the people at Wand&s;worth; and I can truly &s;ay with Paul, <Q>according to his working, which worketh in me mightily,</Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Colo&s;. i. 29.</NOTE> in many of the&s;e meetings: may it have its full effect on the minds of the people. 25th, we attended the &s;elect quarterly meeting in London, at Grace-Church-Street, where I was &s;ilent. 26th, and the quarterly meeting

for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline was large and fa|voured. 27th, we attended its adjournment, and in the evening, the youth's quarterly meeting for wor&s;hip. 28th, were at the meet|ing at King&s;town upon Thames, where &s;ome hardened hearts were felt to oppo&s;e in &s;pirit the ari&s;ing of Truth's te&s;timony, they being in a dark and unbelieving &s;tate. In the even|ing we had a meeting at E&s;her, to &s;olid &s;atis|faction. 29th, attended the burial of a Friend at Alton: dark &s;pirits here al&s;o, I apprehended, inwardly oppo&s;ed the truth: however, the te&s;timony aro&s;e through deep wading over all, ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord!</P>
<P>30th, we had an evening meeting at Ga|dalming, to &s;ome &s;olid in&s;truction. 31&s;t, at|tended the fore and afternoon meetings at Guildford, in which Truth reigned, though things are low there. In the evening we at|tended the &s;elect quarterly meeting, and, 1&s;t of 4th mo. Truth livingly qualified to labour, both in the quarterly meeting for wor&s;hip, and in the men's and women's meetings for church affairs. 2d, we rode to Reading&punc; and 3d. had a meeting there, and in the evening at Kerby. 4th, one at Shillingford, and at evening at Wallingford, and, 5th, one at Abingdon; in all which divers be&s;ides Friends attended, but &s;eemed in general to have very little &s;en&s;e of any thing more in religion than the cu&s;tomary formal performances&mdash;which, according to my ob&s;ervation, is too generally

the ca&s;e with the profe&s;&s;ors of religion in England. Tell them any thing about divine life in religion, and they &s;eem to think one an enthu&s;ia&s;t, and perhaps &s;ome of them would give a &s;mile of ridicule: yet, to do them ju&s;tice, they are pretty generally civil; but appear very in&s;en&s;ible and unbelieving as to divine influence. There is indeed &s;o little entrance into their hearts in many places, that it almo&s;t prevents a door of utterance; and when &s;omething opens, it requires great humility and watchfulne&s;s to keep on the right foundation. I had &s;ome &s;atisfaction in the&s;e la&s;t meetings, though Truth did not reign triumphant over all, as at &s;ome other times.</P>
<P>7th, We had a large meeting at Oxford, &s;ilent for a con&s;iderable time; but Truth gra|dually aro&s;e, and light &s;hined through and over great ob&s;curity and in&s;en&s;ibility.

After meeting we rode to Witney, and 9th, attended the quarterly meeting there&mdash;I was helped a lit|tle, but got very low in mind.</P>
<P>10th. I could not &s;ee my way to go for|ward, &s;o &s;taid the meeting for wor&s;hip, in which I felt and ob&s;erved a total &s;ilence, I believe ordered in divine wi&s;dom as a le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction to others. 11th, we had a meeting at Farringdon. 12th, rode to Cir|cence&s;ter, and had an evening meeting there. 13th, went to Hampton, and, 14th, were at meeting at Nail&s;worth; and in the evening at Pain&s;wick. 15th, we had two meetings at Glouce&s;ter, and, 16th, one at Ro&s;s. In all the&s;e the one univer&s;al and only principle of all true religion and godline&s;s was our help, and, through its own living and helping influ|ence, was declared and te&s;tified of to the peo|ple, though &s;ometimes with but little evidence of entrance; yet at others it &s;eemed evidently to prevail over all. 17th, we had a painful evening meeting at Monmouth in South-Wales
<PB N="319" REF="032810_0332_0FF530582B81A648">
&mdash;divers of the people were whi&s;pering, talking, and &s;ome laughing, near all the time, for which they were pretty clo&s;ely reproved. We concluded the meeting without any at|tempt to preach the go&s;pel among them, for no way &s;eemed to open for it. 18th, we had a pretty large evening meeting at Pontypool, to a degree of &s;atisfaction; from thence we went to Llandilo, and, 21&s;t, were at meeting there, and though I was &s;en&s;ible there was great place in the people's minds, with &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s and tenderne&s;s, I could not expre&s;s a word of what I felt flowing in my heart to|wards them; but for &s;ome cau&s;e, was made an example of &s;ilence among them. O Lord, I pray thee pre&s;erve my &s;pirit alive in thee, and keep me &s;ubjectly given up, whether to &s;peak or keep &s;ilence. After this meeting we rode to Caermarthen, and, 22d, had a meet|ing there, and, 23d, came on the &s;elect meet|ing of mini&s;ters and elders there, for North and South Wales, wherein I experienced con|&s;iderable exerci&s;e among them. Afterwards came on a meeting for wor&s;hip, of Friends only; and then the bu&s;ine&s;s of the quarterly meeting tran&s;acted at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, by what is called the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>24th, Were held two large publick meet|ings, one in the &s;ore and the other in the af|ternoon; &s;ilence was my lot. 25th, the &s;elect meeting and meeting for di&s;cipline met again, after which Friends held another meeting for wor&s;hip among them&s;elves in the evening, my

pain and affliction continued through all, tho' I dropt &s;ome clo&s;e hints in the &s;elect meeting re&s;pecting mini&s;try, and made a few remarks in the evening meeting, which afforded &s;ome relief to my mind. After all the&s;e meetings, I felt not clear of the people of Caermarthen: &s;o when Friends were mo&s;tly gone from the place, dear Deborah Darby, Rebecca Young and my&s;elf, &s;taid one more meeting, viz. on 26th, in which I received much relief; and 27th, rode with a very peaceful mind to Swan|&s;ea; 28th, had great enlargement and relief in the meeting there. The four following days we had meetings at Neath, Cowbridge, Cardiff and Newport. The&s;e were almo&s;t wholly of people not of our profe&s;&s;ion, among whom go&s;pel doctrines were opened (though under &s;ome depre&s;&s;ion at times) in Truth's life and authority. An increa&s;e of true religion in England and Wales is much wanting; yet, ble&s;&s;ed be Jehovah's holy name, a few are found from place to place, who know it in a good degree of dominion.</P>
<P>3d. We left Wales and went to Bri&s;tol, where I met with my dear friend Samuel Emlen from Philadelphia, in America, on a religious vi&s;it to this country, who had been in this city &s;ome time: Our joy was mutual, and mingled with tears of affection, in re|membrance of pa&s;t &s;ea&s;ons of divine refre&s;h|ment together in our native country. 5th, We attended three large publick meetings at the Fryar'a meeting (&s;o called) in the city of
<PB N="321" REF="032810_0334_0FF5301FE1F52550">
Bri&s;tol. 6th, one more &s;elect, though large; and, 7th, two more large publick meetings; the&s;e concluded the yearly meeting at Bri&s;tol. I was &s;ilent through all the&s;e meetings, as was al&s;o dear Samuel Emlen; and on fir&s;t-day af|ternoon the meeting was &s;ilent likewi&s;e. I was led to deplore the low &s;tate of the mini&s;try, with renewed de&s;ires, that our preaching might be &s;uch, through him who is the Re|&s;urrection and the life, that the dead may be rai&s;ed: for the <HI>letter</HI> will <HI>kill,</HI> does kill, and has killed its tens of thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>8th. I attended meeting at Lawrence-We&s;|ton, where, in the power of the go&s;pel, I laboured among them. 9th, I &s;at the meeting in &s;ilence again at Bri&s;tol; and, though I ex|pected, from the exerci&s;e of my mind, my bonds would bur&s;t in &s;under, it proved not &s;o: the time was not come. We went to Melk&s;ham, and vi&s;ited divers families, in true go&s;pel openne&s;s; and 12th. attended the fore and afternoon meetings there, in both which Truth prevailed. 13th, we attended the monthly meeting at Broomham; at &s;ix in the afternoon we had a meeting at Devizes, and one next day at Marlborough, after which I again thankfully acknowledged, 'hitherto hath the Lord helped us.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. vii. 12.</NOTE> 15th and 16th, We had relieving and edifying meetings at Newbury and Maidenhead; our dear friend Samuel Emlen being with us at the&s;e, to our rejoicing. 17th, we attended the meeting at

<P>20th, Began the yearly meeting for church di&s;cipline, for in&s;pecting into the &s;tate of the &s;ociety, and regulations thereof; which con|tinued by adjournments until the 28th, as did the &s;elect meeting until the 29th, the latter not meeting every day like the former: and though I was &s;ilent in &s;everal of the&s;e meet|ings, yet I had &s;ome &s;ervice in &s;ome of them, both publick and in a more &s;elect capacity; and, on the whole, I had a good degree of &s;olid &s;atisfaction in this yearly meeting: the great Helper of I&s;rael was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;hine upon our hearts, and qualify for &s;er|vice in his church. And many deeply exer|ci&s;ed &s;ouls being gathered together, they were a &s;trength to each other. Friends generally appeared conde&s;cending to what aro&s;e as Truth's judgment, whom&s;oever it was thro' and however contrary to what they had con|ceived or expre&s;&s;ed. The Lord is rai&s;ing up a living army in this nation, who are, and if they &s;tand faithful will yet become more and more u&s;eful in the militant church. Oh, the need there is of wi&s;dom and forbearance in the church! may the God of I&s;rael guide, guard and pre&s;erve the hone&s;t-hearted, and

In this meeting dear Mary, the wife of our friend George Stacy, and daughter of our beloved friend Rachel Wil&s;on, for the fir&s;t time ap|peared in publick te&s;timony&mdash;may the Lord pre&s;erve her; &s;he appeared to be a deeply ex|erci&s;ed woman, and to have given up greatly in the cro&s;s, thus to be expo&s;ed.</P>

Then went to Macclesfield, Stockport and Morley; the la&s;t a very large but exerci&s;ing meeting. I found much to &s;ay, but got little &s;olid relief. 17th, we re&s;t|ed at our dear friends Richard and Martha Routh's. 18th, attended monthly meeting there. 19th, we had a good meeting at Old|ham, and 20th, another at Craw&s;hay booth, al&s;o attended monthly meeting there. 21&s;t, we had a ble&s;&s;ed large meeting at Mar&s;den, and one the &s;ame day at Sawley.

We went on to Liverpool; where, 26th, at dear Robert Ben&s;on's, I wrote letters to my friends both in New and Old-England, and next day attended meeting there; the &s;pring was low, but ro&s;e gradually, &s;ome of us &s;inging joyfully unto it.</P>

The wind was mo&s;tly contrary during the pa&s;&s;age, which was therefore a long and trying one of near &s;ix days. 9th, we landed at Dublin,

where I received comfortable letters from home; and after writing letters and vi&s;iting a few families, on the 12th attended meeting at Sycamore-Alley in Dublin, in the life and power of the go&s;pel. 14th, I attended the meeting at Meath-&s;treet and Sycamore-Alley, to my own great relief of mind; 16th, the monthly meeting at Meath-Street, in the en|largement of the go&s;pel; and, through &s;ome clo&s;e &s;earching labours, got great relief. Meath-Street and Sycamore-Alley meetings are both for the &s;ame Friends, but held al|ternately to accommodate, both parts of the town. 17th, accompanied by my kind young friend Thomas Bewley, junior, &s;on of dear Thomas Bewley, at who&s;e hou&s;e I lodged at Dublin, I went to Baltebois, and had there an open meeting among a few Friends and others, and we rode to Ballitore, where I was &s;ick all the next day, being taken the day be|fore. 19th, had a pretty good meeting here, and next day another at Ca&s;tle-Dermot; the day following at Carlow, where, near the clo&s;e of the afternoon meeting, I had to bear te&s;ti|mony to a good degree of peace and &s;atisfac|tion. 22d, long &s;ilence of prevailed in a meeting I had at Kilconner; but truth gave us the vic|tory at la&s;t: ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord for ever.

Thence accompanied &s;till by dear Thomas Bewley, jun. we went to Rathfriland, and 3d of 8th month, had a good meeting there. 4th, attended the meeting there, both fore and afternoon, I was con&s;iderably enlarged in te&s;timony, but in &s;o low and feeble a manner, that after meeting I &s;unk into great di&s;cou|ragement, to think that though I &s;tood up and proceeded in the evidence and feeling of duty, yet very little life or relief of mind was experienced. The meeting was large. 5th, exerci&s;e of mind and pain of body cau&s;ed the la&s;t to be unto me a night of much un|ea&s;ine&s;s; but endeavouring this morning to 'po&s;&s;e&s;s my&s;elf in patience.' I became at length compo&s;ed. 6th, I remained unwell, but rode to Lurgan, and was at meeting there next day. I felt no freedom that pub|lick notice &s;hould be given, which was very unu&s;ual; and near the clo&s;e of the meeting, (having &s;at in &s;ilence) I &s;tood up, though not expecting to &s;ay any thing in the u&s;ual line of the mini&s;try, and told them, tho&s;e who go to their religious meetings with expectations and de&s;ires of outward help, and are thereby di|verted from looking inward and feeling after divine help, go to their meetings in a devia|tion of mind from a true go&s;pel &s;tate and de|pendance&mdash;and all who are looking to in&s;tru|ments

for help in their meetings, otherwi&s;e than helped of God through them, and in his own time and according to his own will, are not true wor&s;hippers in &s;pirit and in truth. But I have cau&s;e to believe, that even &s;ome of our &s;ociety, at times, who attend meetings and &s;it very &s;till and orderly, know little or nothing of true &s;ilence, and feel very little of that exerci&s;e of &s;oul by which they may experience true chri&s;tian watch and prayer, when a&s;&s;embled together before God, and in his awful pre&s;ence.&mdash;The meeting then broke up, and I felt &s;olid peace, in a living &s;en&s;e, that I had not kindled a fire of my own; but had been limited to Truth's pure motion, which is ever &s;afe.</P>
<P>8th. I was at the meeting at Li&s;burn: pub|lick notice was given, but the meeting was &s;ilent. 9th, I had a meeting at Kill&s;borough, wherein I laboured in a low way, I hope to &s;ome edification. Truth ro&s;e not very high, and I rejoiced that the animation of nature ro&s;e not above it. 11th, I was at meeting at Ballenderry in the forenoon, and in the after|noon was again at Li&s;burn, both good open meetings. 13th, I had a large painful meet|ing among the Pre&s;byterians, at Newtown-Aras near Mile-Cro&s;s. They were too wi&s;e, rich and full, for in&s;trumental help much to reach or benefit them. I left them with a heavy heart, and returned with my kind friend John Hancock to his hou&s;e near Li&s;burn, and 15th, attended monthly meeting there, to a

good degree of &s;atisfaction, and next day had a good meeting at Antrim; and the day fol|lowing another at Grange; and then went to Ballimany, where, on the 18th, I had a very large one. An ear was open in a few to hear the true go&s;pel preached; but the crowd and concour&s;e was &s;o great, and large num|bers &s;o light and un&s;ettled, and &s;ome &s;o noi&s;y, that we were under a nece&s;&s;ity of concluding the meeting much &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e we might have done; after which divers of the &s;ober people with tears de&s;ired we would have another meeting, and propo&s;ed our having a large meeting-hou&s;e in the town for the pur|po&s;e. They appeared greatly grieved at the behaviour of &s;ome of their neighbours, and much di&s;appointed at hearing &s;o little of Truth's living te&s;timony declared. My bow|els yearned towards them, but we could not &s;ee a way open in the light to appoint another meeting. Indeed what little was uttered among them was &s;o much in the life that they greatly hungered for more; and I thought it much better to leave them hunger|ing, than to fill them until they might even loathe the honey-comb. So in much love we left them, and rode to Ballynacree.</P>
<P>19th, we had good open meetings at Bal|lynacree and Colerain. My openne&s;s and &s;er|vice was as u&s;ual mo&s;tly towards people not of our &s;ociety; and next day at Toberhead, which appeared to be a feeble one; and the day following I had good &s;atisfaction in the
<PB N="329" REF="032810_0342_0FF530D682DFA438">
monthly meeting at Grange, near Charle|mont, both in the publick and in the more &s;elect part. There is a little living remnant of valuable Friends belonging to that month|ly meeting. 22d, we had a good meeting among Friends and others, at Ballahagan; next day a relieving one at Moy; and, 25th, the fore and afternoon meetings at Grange were large and highly favoured, as was that held next day at the Pre&s;byterian meeting-hou&s;e in Dungannon. The doctrines of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, in mo&s;t of the&s;e meetings in the north, flowed like oil upon the &s;pirits of the people. But this la&s;t meeting was hurt by an un&s;kilful and un&s;ea&s;onable appear|ance, after the people were ri&s;en to go out.</P>
<P>27th, we had a meeting at a place called Carborough, among a few Friends and a pretty many Pre&s;byterians. In this meeting go&s;pel truths flowed &s;omewhat largely in a gentle current of life to the people; but there was too little of a door of entrance into their hearts to admit of any great dominion of the life divine among them. Even Je&s;us wrought not many mighty works in &s;ome places, be|cau&s;e of the people's unbelief; they &s;hut up the kingdom of heaven again&s;t them&s;elves, which is often the ca&s;e in our day. Next day I attended at Grange; and from the 31&s;t of the 8th month to the 3d of the 9th, was held the quarterly meeting there, in the cour&s;e of which Truth reigned over all, both in publick te&s;timony, and at times in &s;olemn &s;ilence,
<PB N="330" REF="032810_0343_0FF53169C25D6860">
though &s;ome &s;pirits &s;eemed oppo&s;ed thereto. 4th, attended again the meeting at Grange, and next day rode to Lurgan, and had a painful meeting there. Notice was given to the town's people, and many attended; but it &s;eemed as though they knew &s;carce any thing about the life of religion. I got little relief among them. Friends there, as well as others, are in a low &s;tate.</P>
<P>After this I was at two meetings at Moy-Allen, one &s;ilent, and the other nearly &s;o. One at Ballahagan, long &s;ilent and &s;uffering, but ended triumphant. One at Richhill, dull and painful. One at Ca&s;tle&s;hane, &s;ilent until near the clo&s;e, when I opened to the people the impo&s;&s;ibility of man's preaching the go&s;|pel without immediate divine help. One at Coothill, wherein the joy of the Lord was our &s;trength, and in true go&s;pel authority the peo|ple were in&s;tructed in the go&s;pel my&s;teries of Chri&s;t in man, his hope of glory. At Coot|hill there was a great fair, and a fight, which was in &s;ome degree bloody&punc; con&s;idering the occa&s;ion, between the &s;oldiers with &s;words, and country people with clubs, about a lad ju&s;t enli&s;ted, who attempting to make his e&s;cape, the &s;oldiers endeavouring to &s;ecure him, the country people were enraged, and aiming to &s;upport his e&s;cape, the quarrel ran &s;o high that the &s;treet was in an uproar from end to end; and being crowded full of country peo|ple, town's people and &s;oldiers, to the amount I &s;uppo&s;e of &s;everal thou&s;ands, the &s;cene was

truly affecting; and though I believe there were no lives lo&s;t, yet as there was con&s;idera|ble blood&s;hed, and divers wounded, it afford|ed a very horrid &s;pectacle of the depravity of human nature. And I thought it not ami&s;s to give a hint of it here, as it led me to mourn over the benighted and dreadful &s;tate of poor mankind.</P>
<P>What dreadful wars have raged, through almo&s;t all ages and nations! What rivers of blood have human beings drawn from human beings! and what havock are men &s;till mak|ing of human lives, who &s;ay they are chri&s;|tians! At this very day (Oh, &s;ad to mention) is France and England, and divers other Eu|ropean nations embroiled in cruel wars! Will the &s;tate of mankind never be meliorated! Will the &s;word devour for ever, and the glo|rious and benign influence of the go&s;pel, by the wrath of men for ever be defeated! For|bid it, gracious heaven!

<P><PB N="332" REF="032810_0345_0FF5319C7B8FF490">After this, from the 15th to the 21&s;t, we had meetings at Old-Ca&s;tle, Edenderry, Tim|mahoe, Rathangan, Athy and Ballanakill&mdash; the fir&s;t of the&s;e was open and edifying, the next very eminently over&s;hadowed and owned of the Shepherd of I&s;rael, notwith&s;tanding there were &s;ome &s;trong oppo&s;ers pre&s;ent. Ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord God Omni|potent, who reigneth and will reign over all, convincing his enemies that they are but as du&s;t beneath his feet, and all their oppo&s;ition to his &s;piritual reign and government, as a cloud which the &s;un di&s;pelleth.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the&s;e meetings were mo&s;tly dull painful &s;ea&s;ons, &s;everal almo&s;t &s;ilent, and the others laborious and but little relieving. At Rathangan a young man &s;at and behaved very irreverently during much of the meeting; at the clo&s;e I reproved him; he retorted, was angry and denied the charge, and complained of ill treatment. I felt the power of truth increa&s;ing over the meeting, and when he had vented him&s;elf and &s;pent his venemous &s;hafts, I &s;tood up and delivered what was fur|ther on my mind re&s;pecting the poor dark depraved creature, and addre&s;&s;ed the people in the love of the go&s;pel, the meeting clo&s;ed to &s;olid &s;atisfaction. I found afterwards he was a di&s;&s;olute &s;tage-player. Oh the mi&s;chiefs of the theatre! what di&s;&s;ipation it promotes! it operates directly again&s;t the life of religion, and tends to the de&s;truction of morals! where &s;hall we go to find the fear of God in an ac|tor?

yet, &s;orrowful to &s;ay, too many great profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, and &s;ome of the pretended mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, are not a&s;hamed openly to plead for, and with all their eloquence promote the de&s;tructive practice of &s;tage-playing. My very &s;oul is grieved within me when I view the fallen &s;tate of poor de|generated chri&s;tians, and above all the dead, dark and carnal-minded &s;tate of the clergy, &s;o called, like &s;warms of locu&s;ts they darken the air, and in many places eat up almo&s;t every green thing. In&s;tead of turning the people to God, they bring them under the admini&s;tration of the letter that kills, and thus the &s;piritual fre&s;hne&s;s or greenne&s;s, begotten of God, at times by his holy &s;pirit in &s;ome, is as it were, eaten out. But God Almighty will &s;weep them from the face of the earth. The time a&s;&s;uredly cometh when great Baby|lon's merchandize and traffic &s;hall fail, and when her fle&s;h &s;hall be burnt with fire. The Lord of ho&s;ts hath &s;poken it.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony at Athy was much by way of opening the deceits, worldly-mindedne&s;s, and want of real go&s;pel qualification, in tho&s;e hireling teachers, who, if ever &s;uch in any age exi&s;ted, are the 'blind leaders of the blind.'<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xv. 14.</NOTE> And I am per&s;uaded that no cla&s;s of men in the&s;e nations do more to ob&s;truct the true work of the go&s;pel, and the coming of Chri&s;t's kingdom on earth as in heaven, than the&s;e; but I repeat it again, God will do them away!

<P>At Ballanakill there was &s;o little &s;en&s;e of true religion among the people, and &s;o much lightne&s;s and irreverence, that no way opened in the &s;pring of the go&s;pel to preach Je&s;us and the re&s;urrection among them; &s;o the meet|ing was nece&s;&s;arily &s;ilent, for we preach not our&s;elves; and not being able rightly to call Je&s;us Lord, but by the Holy Gho&s;t, dur&s;t not attempt to preach his go&s;pel without that divine unction and influence, well knowing it cannot be done; and that &s;o many thou|&s;ands attempting to do it, has been the means of overrunning the nations with the dead formal image of wor&s;hip, con&s;i&s;ting of words without life and &s;ounds without &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>When the meeting concluded I reproved the levity and irreverence of the people, en|deavoured to put them upon a &s;erious enquiry re&s;pecting a preparation for death, and left them with an aching heart.

<P>But alas! alas! who and where are the&s;e? Truly not all who are profe&s;&s;ing &s;o to do. But this is the &s;tandard unto which the true and thorough go&s;pel wor&s;hipper mu&s;t be re|duced.

and giveth life; and every departure from a right dependance on it, every zeal|ous movement in &s;upport of Truth's te&s;ti|mony independant of its nece&s;&s;ary aid, tends to introduce death, and &s;et man on the throne, in&s;tead of him who is God over all for ever.</P>
<P>22d, we attended meeting both fore and afternoon at Mountmelick, where live our beloved friends Mary Ridgeway and Jane Wat&s;on, lately on a religious vi&s;it to Ameri|ca; they were both at this time at home, where I was glad to feel unity with their &s;pirits in the fre&s;h life of the everla&s;ting co|venant. It was a time of con&s;iderable open|ne&s;s and enlargement in the go&s;pel. I had, as at many other places, to bear te&s;timony again&s;t the blind leaders of the blind which &s;warm through the land, and are a grievous oppre&s;&s;ion upon the poor people, grinding them down exceedingly, and yet in general doing them no good; but a great deal of in|jury in regard to the things of religion. In|deed, if ever people &s;pent their money for that which is not bread, they do it mo&s;t &s;or|rowfully &s;o, both in England and Ireland.</P>
<P>23d, I vi&s;ited two &s;chools, attended a meet|ing of mini&s;ters and elders, and then rode to Tullamore, where we had a meeting con&s;i&s;t|ing of the people of the town chiefly. 25th, we had a lively precious meeting at Balla|murry. Next day I re&s;ted and wrote, and
<PB N="338" REF="032810_0351_0FF530A5067D3588">
endeavoured to be content in my pre&s;ent al|lotment, though truly it is &s;ometimes difficult to feel re&s;ignation in &s;o painful a pilgrimage as much of mine has been in Ireland. There is &s;o much &s;uper&s;tition and lifele&s;s formality among the people in general; &s;o little real religious exerci&s;e, or true knowledge and ex|perience of divine things; and &s;uch &s;triving to make forms and creaturely performances an&s;wer in&s;tead of life and &s;ub&s;tance; that it is often almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to obtain much &s;olid relief, by expre&s;&s;ing among them even what opens and impre&s;&s;es the mind in the life and love of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>This was a mo&s;t trying day to me. The elements &s;eemed all in commotion. Strife, conte&s;t and alarm &s;eemed almo&s;t continually to pervade the whole man, and agitate all that was alive within me. I &s;trove for calm|ne&s;s and patience; but great was the di&s;tre&s;s, which I was left to labour under, and extreme the de&s;ertion of all &s;en&s;ible comfort or divine good. I looked up towards heaven; I tried to draw inwardly near unto God, and to crave his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the return of his countenance and pre&s;ence; but he hid him|&s;elf in thick darkne&s;s, and &s;tood as it were aloof from my cry. I was greatly overwhelm|ed with &s;orrow, and &s;wallowed up of di&s;tre&s;s! I retired &s;everal times; I lay down on my bed; I read the bible and &s;ome other pre|cious writings; but through all I felt almo&s;t as if I was entirely for&s;aken!&mdash;At length I
<PB N="339" REF="032810_0352_0FF5314CE58E0768">
yielded up my whole life and being, as I had often done before, to go through and endure every pang, peril and perturbation, which God all-wi&s;e might &s;ee meet to prove me with, and for as long continuance as he &s;hould &s;ee needful.&mdash;So, in the evening, the waves of the &s;ea began to &s;ub&s;ide a little at his voice whom both wind and &s;ea obey for ever. I grew more tranquil, and had a pretty good night's re&s;t. This morning when I awoke, being 27th, I felt in my body as it I had been all over brui&s;ed, &s;uch had been my ex|treme agony of &s;oul ye&s;terday, and &s;uch is the &s;ympathy between &s;oul and body. Some may &s;carce believe me; but there is one who knows I lie not. I read, and then walked out a while; the &s;un &s;hone plea&s;antly; the birds &s;ang, and the whole face of nature was beautiful; but my &s;oul remembered the gall and the wormwood, and I &s;eemed forbidden to take much &s;atisfaction in any thing vi&s;ible. Oh, my God, thou art weaning me &s;till more and more, and much more than I once thought nece&s;&s;ary, from the world, and from all that is in it&mdash;Well, good is thy will, and thy coun&s;el is excellent.&mdash;Do with me what thou wilt; form, fa&s;hion and reduce me as thou plea&s;e&s;t. Thou ha&s;t given me clearly to &s;ee, that many who have even been in thy furnace came out too &s;oon, and remain dro&s;&s;y and impure all their days by not abiding thy judgments, and not enduring the turnings of thy holy hand upon them, and not following thee fully into all that &s;eparates and weans
<PB N="340" REF="032810_0353_0FF531B4CC93C5B8">
from all that fle&s;h and blood delights in, which thou calle&s;t for, and art graciou&s;ly leading &s;uch as will follow thee into. Oh! redeem my &s;oul from all that hinders its full and un|impeded acce&s;s to thee, the fountain of living waters: &s;et my affections wholly on things di|vine, and make me entirely thy own in the heavenly image and fellow&s;hip for ever.</P>
<P>28th, In deep depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirit I attended the &s;elect quarterly meeting at Moat, held for mini&s;ters and elders of the province of Lein|&s;ter; and next day I attended the publick quarterly meeting, was &s;ilent excepting a few words; and the day following I attended al|mo&s;t in &s;ilence the meeting for church affairs; and Oh! the want of deeper dwelling in the divine life!</P>
<P>1&s;t of 10th mo. Having thus &s;pent four or five days mo&s;tly in deep di&s;tre&s;s and agony of foul, the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to open the &s;pring of life, un&s;eal my lips, and make me dip my foot in oil, treading on high places in the name and &s;trength of the highe&s;t. He tuned my harp anew, put a new &s;ong in my heart and mouth, and divinely &s;trung my bow for battle: thus the concluding meeting held for wor&s;hip this la&s;t day of the quarterly meeting was eminently owned of the Lord: and Chri&s;t the re&s;urrection and the life was joyfully known among us: in his re&s;urrection we aro&s;e with him; and becau&s;e he lived, we lived al&s;o; I mean principally &s;uch as had
<PB N="341" REF="032810_0354_0FF531B6640079F8">
been baptized in the likene&s;s of his death, watched faithfully with him, and continued with him in his temptations and &s;ufferings; for unto the&s;e it was he appointed a king|dom: theirs it is; and they continuing &s;tead|fa&s;t with him through all tribulation, &s;hall, in &s;pite of death and hell, enjoy it. Much &s;earching work prevailed in te&s;timony, thro' the openings of life, and much con&s;olation to the mourners in Sion, was graciou&s;ly vouch|&s;afed.</P>
<P>2d, was at Birr; and, 4th, we had a mo&s;t triumphant meeting at Montrath; the te&s;ti|mony of the go&s;pel flowed like oil to many, and yet antichri&s;t was expo&s;ed in his true colours: ble&s;&s;ed for ever be the Lord, who hitherto hath helped us. After this we had meetings at Knock-Ballamaher, Ro&s;s-Crea, Limerick, Cork, Boudon, Younghall, Garry|rian, Clonmel, and the &s;everal &s;ittings of the quarterly meeting at Waterford, for the pro|vince of Mun&s;ter. Divers of the&s;e were high|ly favoured &s;ea&s;ons, but &s;ome of them afford|ed far le&s;s &s;atisfaction than others. From thence we went to Dublin in order to attend the national half-year's meeting, where I was again kindly received by my kind friend Thomas Bewley and children; and many other dear friends gave me a hearty welcome: this has al&s;o been my experience in many other places. On the 26th, the national &s;e|lect meeting opened; it was large, and the
<PB N="342" REF="032810_0355_0FF53035B8592BC0">
members, at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, appeared to be alive in a good degree in the holy root.</P>
<P>27th, In the meeting at Meath-Street and Sycamore-Alley, I was greatly favoured; Truth's divine te&s;timony was, like fire among rubbi&s;h, again&s;t worldly-mindedne&s;s, indiffe|rence and revolt; and &s;ome fre&s;h encourage|ment flowed to the mourners in Sion, the drooping-&s;pirited and young and tender; the doctrines and con&s;olations of the go&s;pel being pretty largely opened. The four days following were held and concluded the na|tional meeting for good order in the &s;ociety. Al&s;o two more meetings for wor&s;hip, and the concluding &s;elect meeting, all the&s;e as parts of the national meeting. A good degree of zeal appeared in many for the &s;upport of our chri&s;tian di&s;cipline; and things were conduct|ed in a degree of brotherly love and concord. And yet the lack in too many of the divine anointing oil, in the &s;everal movements, was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt, that I &s;at rather a mourner in mo&s;t of the&s;e meetings, and could &s;ay but very little in them from fir&s;t to la&s;t.</P>
<P>I may here relate a remarkable occurrence, viz. when I was in Dublin, &s;oon after my fir&s;t landing, I was livingly opened in the life and power of the go&s;pel, at a meeting at Sy|camore-Alley, in which, among other things, I had a good deal to &s;ay about the &s;piritual fire of the Lord which is in Sion, and his furnace which is in Jeru&s;alem, for the refin|ing
<PB N="343" REF="032810_0356_0FF531984E180840">
of all &s;uch as ever become his &s;ons and daughters. A man, in a &s;table near by, made a great noi&s;e to drown my voice, which he continued for &s;ome little time, and as my voice rai&s;ed he increa&s;ed his noi&s;e; and I was told that &s;ome heard him &s;aying &s;omething in contempt about the fire I &s;pake of, or howe|ver he was heard &s;peaking about the <HI>burning of the fire.</HI> Another per&s;on di&s;charged a gun ju&s;t by the meeting-hou&s;e, when I was in the mid&s;t of my mo&s;t fervent engagement; the report was very loud and di&s;turbed many; but I was carried through as if nothing had happened; ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord. But now on my return to Dublin, I was fully informed that the poor wretched man, who &s;houted &s;o loudly in the &s;table to drown my voice, and &s;pake &s;o ignorantly about the burn|ing of the fire, was in le&s;s than two weeks after con&s;umed to death by fire in the &s;ame &s;table where he had thus impiou&s;ly behaved; for the &s;table taking fire by &s;ome means when he was in it, he was burnt before he could be got out.</P>
<P>This I heard of &s;everal weeks before my return, but I cho&s;e not to in&s;ert it until I had got fuller information and confirmation in the city; but finding it fact, and much noticed by many people of different religious profe&s;|&s;ions in Dublin, as a very remarkable in&s;tance of the providence or judgment of God; I thought proper to give the relation of it a place here, and I do it without pre&s;uming to
<PB N="344" REF="032810_0357_0FF531B8116E8E10">
&s;ay how far it was in &s;pecial judgment. But as God's dealings are all in wi&s;dom, perhaps &s;uch an in&s;tance of his all-wi&s;e government as this may have a &s;triking and profitable effect upon &s;ome of the hardened and daring who may read it, or at lea&s;t may tend to guard and caution &s;ome of the le&s;s abandoned again&s;t giving way to the &s;ugge&s;tions of infidelity, profanene&s;s or audacity. For mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly there is a God of ju&s;tice as well as mercy, who &s;ees and knows all our thoughts, words and actions, and for every evil will bring us into judgment; yea, for every thing contrary to his holy will and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>After the national meeting, which ended on the la&s;t day of the 10th month, I &s;taid in Dublin &s;ome days, not &s;eeing my way open to go for England or el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of the 11th month, I was again &s;ilent at the meeting at Sycamore-Alley, as I al&s;o was at the meeting in the forenoon on the fir&s;t-day following; but in the afternoon at Sycamore-Alley, I was &s;omewhat enlarged, though not a great deal relieved, My &s;oul was indeed, for a number of days, in deep affliction in that great city; in&s;omuch that I greatly doubted my being enabled to leave it with plea&s;antne&s;s. 3d, I attended a meeting at Ballabrigan, about fifteen miles from Dub|lin, appointed for my dear friend Ann Tuke, daughter of William Tuke of York&s;hire, in England. This meeting was very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing:
<PB N="345" REF="032810_0358_0FF531CE6CF9B7B8">
the people &s;eemed to know but very little of the real nature of divine wor&s;hip. I returned in heavine&s;s to the city, and next day got a de|gree of refre&s;hment in the meeting at Meath-&s;treet, through deep dwelling and keeping low in and with a little low &s;tream of life, which at length enlarged to &s;omething of a river; but &s;till I could not quite ea&s;e off my bur|den, nor ri&s;e above my deep depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirit. Another meeting at the &s;ame place in the afternoon, appointed by A. Tuke, afford|ed me a degree of additional relief, &s;o that I began to feel a little cheerful. 5th, I felt re|&s;trained from attending a meeting appointed for the &s;ame Friend at Dunlary; I knew not why, but I felt ea&s;ie&s;t to decline going, &s;o I re&s;ted and wrote at the hou&s;e of my dear friend Thomas Bewley, bringing up this account to the time of &s;aid day of re&s;t and writing.</P>
<P>After writing thus far, our dear friend, not feeling him&s;elf at liberty to leave Dublin, un|til the 9th of 11th month, when by accounts received he attended a publick meeting at John&s;town, and being accompanied by S. S. and A. S. went that evening to Ballitore, to the hou&s;e of our friend Elizabeth Shackleton. On fir&s;t-day the 10th he &s;poke largely in the morning meeting, and very powerfully in a publick meeting which was held in the even|ing at his reque&s;t, after which, he imparted
<PB N="346" REF="032810_0359_0FF5308D4EC595F0">
weighty and in&s;tructive coun&s;el in a Friend's family, concluding in awful &s;upplication. The following night he was taken unwell, which continued to increa&s;e until the 14th, when an eruption appeared which proved to be the &s;mall-pox, during which time his mind was pre&s;erved in calmne&s;s and re&s;ignation, and mentioned that <Q>it mattered little what part of the world he died in; that he &s;ometimes hoped to &s;ee New-England again and his dear children, but that he had no will in it; that he had looked clo&s;ely towards home and his connections, and into the &s;tate of his own mind, though he did not know how the di&s;order would terminate.</Q> During the progre&s;s of the di&s;order he was kindly attend|ed by &s;everal Friends, and among them was our friend Ann Tuke, who pre&s;erved the fol|lowing daily account.</P>
<P>5th-day 14th, He &s;aid, <Q>there is an eternal Arm underneath each of us, which is &s;uffi|cient to bear up and &s;upport, and will do it, as far as is needful we &s;hould be &s;upported. I have long been confirmed in the &s;enti|ment, that nothing could po&s;&s;ibly happen that would harm me while I keep under the divine influence.</Q></P>
<P>A phy&s;ician from Dublin having been &s;ent for, came this evening, with which he ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;atisfaction, &s;aying, he de&s;ired that he would continue near him, which he did ac|cordingly. Some time after, he &s;aid, <Q>though

<P>15th. <Q>The di&s;order is pretty &s;trongly making its progre&s;s; I can &s;carce get any &s;leep; my &s;trength fails a little, but I admire at its holding out &s;o well; the pock on the face is, if not quite, very nearly confluent; the face con&s;iderably &s;welled; on the body it is pretty di&s;tinct.

although my &s;pirits are under little or no depre&s;&s;ion at all. Perhaps I never &s;aw a time before, when all things not criminal were &s;o near alike to me in point of any di&s;|turbance to the mind. I do not know but when awake and capable of contemplation, I nearly rejoice and give thanks in all. When I verge a little towards &s;leep I am all afloat from the &s;tate of my nerves, and from the extreme irritation forced almo&s;t immediate|ly, and with very unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ations from beginning repo&s;e, but through all the &s;oul &s;eems deeply anchored in God. Many and painful have been the probationary exerci&s;es of this life to me. Ah! were there proba|bility of &s;trength, how I could enlarge, for my heart &s;eems melted within me in retro|&s;pective view; but all the former conflicts, however grievous in their time, are lighter now than vanity, except as they are clearly &s;een to have contributed largely to the &s;anc|tification of the &s;oul; as they are remem|bered with awfulne&s;s and gratitude before Him who has not been wanting to pre&s;erve through them all; and as they &s;eem likely to introduce either very &s;hortly, or before a very long time to an exceeding and eternal weight of glory.

The Lord thy God hath &s;ervice for thee in Ireland, was often &s;ounded through the ear of my &s;oul, before I left home, as di&s;tinctly as you hear me now &s;peak it.</Q> In the morning, when &s;peaking to the doctors who attended him, he &s;aid to this purpo&s;e, <Q>I believe my having the di&s;or|der, and being here, is in the ordering of Providence. It is not given me to know the event; but if there be a field of future labour for me to enter into, it is as po&s;&s;ible for the Ma&s;ter to rai&s;e me up now as it was at the fir&s;t; but I have no will in it I think.' The fore part of this day he &s;eemed ea&s;y and walk|ed down &s;tairs, expre&s;&s;ing that he could do it nearly as well as ever.</Q> The fever came on towards evening, and he became very re&s;t|le&s;s;
<PB N="353" REF="032810_0366_0FF5319AA5068018">
his &s;wallowing was al&s;o difficult, but had no other unfavourable &s;ymptom, and this was not deemed more than u&s;ual in this afflicting di&s;order. In the night got &s;ome unea&s;y &s;leep, &s;wallowing and expectoration very difficult and painful.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day morning the 17th, on being a&s;k|ed how he re&s;ted, replied, <Q>I have got through with what we call much difficulty to obtain a little relief.</Q> He de&s;ired his affectionate love to M. B. the family and friends in Dub|lin, intimating the weight of the di&s;order, and his e&s;cape from many trials, if he &s;hould be removed; yet &s;aid, <Q>The Lord is able to rai&s;e me up, his Arm is underneath, but from my pre&s;ent feeblene&s;s, it is very uncertain;</Q> and &s;eemed not to have any conclu&s;ion how it would terminate. He de&s;ired to be re|membered to dear M. R. and J. W. in the love of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel. At another time &s;aid, <Q>I am in a very low way, cannot &s;ee about the event, but mu&s;t leave all to the Lord; the &s;trength of nature &s;eems very doubtful.</Q> He continued all this day under much oppre&s;&s;ion from the load of matter, took wine and bark every hour, but no alarming &s;ymptoms appeared.&mdash;He reque&s;ted that if he was removed, &s;ome further parti|culars might be tran&s;mitted to his friends at home, adding in &s;ub&s;tance. <Q>The Lord's will is ble&s;&s;ed, and I feel no controver&s;y with it. It is the Lord that enables us to coincide with his will, and &s;ay amen to all the trials and conflicts he permits to attend us. My mind is centred in that which brings into perfect
<PB N="354" REF="032810_0367_0FF5317FB5FD3E48">
acquie&s;cence: there is nothing in this world worth being enjoyed out of the divine will. It is his will that brings us into a &s;tate of exi&s;tence, and it is for a purpo&s;e of his glo|ry. When my mind is ab&s;tracted and ca|pable of deriving &s;atisfaction from any thing outward, it is an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction that my lot is ca&s;t here, and that I am &s;ur|rounded by &s;uch near and dear friends, both from within this family, and the&s;e without who have accompanied.</Q> The fore part of this night &s;lept more than u&s;ual, and remain|ed through the whole of it tolerably ea&s;y.</P>
<P>18th, 2d-day. Frequently expre&s;&s;ed that nature had a hard &s;truggle, and his getting through was very doubtful. The &s;ymptoms, con&s;idering the load of matter, continued fa|vourable. He gave directions, that, if he &s;hould go hence, every thing about his inter|ment &s;hould be plain and &s;imple, and &s;aid that he who rai&s;ed up Lazarus could, if he had further labour for him to do, break his bands a&s;under; but that, when he rea&s;oned upon the nature of the di&s;order and his own con&s;titution, and felt the conflicts of nature, it &s;eemed as if he was gradually advancing to|wards his everla&s;ting home. To two Friends from Mountmelick he expre&s;&s;ed his entire re&s;ignation to divine di&s;po&s;al, and that he found nothing to &s;tand between him and the fountain of everla&s;ting love: &s;aid, <Q>he knew many Friends in Ireland loved him, and he loved them in the Lord Je&s;us, and de&s;ired to be affectionately remembered to &s;uch as might enquire after him.</Q> This night, and
<PB N="355" REF="032810_0368_0FF5306C0BE5D660">
until three in the morning, (3d-day 19th) he patiently and quietly &s;uffered much; yet got &s;everal naps. About &s;even in the evening his &s;tomach, too weak to bear the bark and wine, di&s;charged the la&s;t potion; he remarked the&s;e efforts to &s;upport nature failing; and added, <Q>There are many re&s;ources in nature, but if the great Author of nature does not think fit that any of them &s;hould be for me, all is well: I could not de&s;ire to have &s;uch another &s;truggle to go through, and I think, if you can part with me, I can with you with a degree of cheerfulne&s;s.</Q>&mdash;The fore part of the night &s;pent quiet and patient as u&s;ual, much oppre&s;&s;ed and worn down with this grievous malady: he &s;aid, <Q>I have no fear, for perfect love ca&s;teth out all fear, and he that feareth is not perfected in love.</Q></P>
<P>20th, About five o'clock on fourth-day morning he &s;upplicated thus: <Q>O Lord my God, thou that ha&s;t been with me from my youth to this day; if a man who hath en|dured with a degree of patience the various turnings of thy holy hand, may be permit|ted to &s;upplicate thy name; cut &s;hort the work in righteou&s;ne&s;s, if con&s;i&s;tent with thy will; thou, who ha&s;t wrought deliverance for Jacob, evince that thou art able to break my bonds a&s;under, and &s;hew forth thy &s;al|vation, that &s;o my &s;oul may magnify thy name for ever and ever.</Q> And after a pau&s;e, wherein he &s;eemed to feel the earne&s;t of his petition, added, 'So be it &s;aith my &s;oul.'&mdash; After two o'clock his &s;tomach refu&s;ed all nouri&s;hment, and a hiccough came on; he
<PB N="356" REF="032810_0369_0FF52FFDC39A8410">
&s;aid, <Q>Do not force nature, let me pa&s;s quiet|ly away to the eternal inheritance, to which I have no objection to go, and the &s;ooner the better if the work be done, I have no wi&s;h to lay here.</Q>&mdash;His oppre&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to increa&s;e, and in a little while he &s;aid, <Q>I am waiting patiently to &s;ee the &s;alvation of God: do you wait patiently with me. I have no de&s;ire, nor the &s;hadow of de&s;ire, to be re&s;tored. I hope the doctors will &s;oon find that they have done their part.</Q> The fore part of this night he could take little ex|cept water, &s;lept at times pretty ea&s;y to ap|pearance, at others his breathing very diffi|cult. On P. J. a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, he &s;aid, <Q>I am no flatterer, but thou art one I depended on for outward a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thou ha&s;t con|tributed much to the relief of this body, and thy being here has been an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction to me.</Q></P>
<P>21&s;t. At three o'clock on 5th-day morning, &s;aid, <Q>You have &s;een the awful progre&s;s of this di&s;order; as to me, it matters little only pre&s;ent pain&mdash;may the Lord relea&s;e me &s;hortly.</Q> Complained of the want of more air, and &s;eemed declining fa&s;t. Towards evening &s;aid, <Q>You may tell my friends in New-England, and every part of the world, that never did my &s;oul ble&s;s the Lord on account of any worldly enjoyment, as I do now, in the ble&s;&s;ing felt by me to be con|tained in the pro&s;pect of a very &s;peedy re|lea&s;e.</Q> To a per&s;on who came to &s;ee him he &s;aid, <Q>Oh! Charles! Charles! an inherit|ance in the eternal truth is infinitely, infi|nitely
<PB N="357" REF="032810_0370_0FF530191BB22238">
&s;uperior to all the enjoyments this world can afford; remember it as long as thou live&s;t.</Q> Some time after, <Q>I do not wi&s;h ha&s;tily to make my e&s;cape; but if the Lord will be plea&s;ed to relea&s;e me from the bonds of mortality and the &s;truggles of life, and to cut the work &s;hort, con&s;iderably &s;hort, in righteou&s;ne&s;s, I think I &s;hall be willing to enrol it in the li&s;t of his un&s;peak|able favours.</Q> To the afore&s;aid, <Q>Farewell Charles, let no po&s;&s;ible con&s;ideration divert thee from a clo&s;e attention to <HI>that,</HI> without which life mu&s;t be lived in vain.</Q> At ano|ther time &s;aid, <Q>Some of my wi&s;hes for my|&s;elf are centred in as &s;peedy a relea&s;e as may be, con&s;i&s;tent with the will of our hea|venly Father, and an admi&s;&s;ion, which I have no doubt at all, not in the lea&s;t degree, of obtaining, into that glorious kingdom, where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary &s;oul is eternally at re&s;t.</Q> In a while after, <Q>I think I have not, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, known much or any thing of boa&s;ting; I have known &s;omething of that law of grace whereby all boa&s;ting is entirely excluded; but I may &s;ay, through that which has &s;upported me under all the trials and conflicts which have attended my pa&s;&s;age through life, to you my beloved friends as to dear children,&mdash;follow me as I have endeavoured to follow Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Lord of life and glory, and the Rock of my eternal &s;alvation.</Q></P>
<P>At another time &s;aid, <Q>It would have been de&s;irable to me to have been favoured with
<PB N="358" REF="032810_0371_0FF5301E1690A838">
a clearer and more certain pro&s;pect re&s;pect|ing the termination of this event; yet if I &s;hould be continued a while longer, I do not di&s;pute but my end would be un&s;peak|ably glorious.&mdash;It would be painful to me to have to return again to combat the trials and conflicts of mortality; but if the Lord &s;hould &s;ee meet to continue me a while longer, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit, after having in hu|mility and re&s;ignation put up my interce&s;|&s;ions to be relea&s;ed from the &s;truggle of nature; to have had pro&s;pects of further labour is not uncommon, it has happened to many; and the Lord can rai&s;e up and qualify others for his own work and &s;ervice, and he will &s;end by whom he will &s;end, and is able to &s;ave by many or by few. I feel, and I wi&s;h you to feel for and with me, after the eternal Rock of life and &s;alvation; for, as we are e&s;tabli&s;hed thereon, we &s;hall be in the everla&s;ting unity, which cannot be &s;haken by all the changes of time, nor in|terrupted in a never-ending eternity. I do expect con&s;iderable derangement will now take place; it is no di&s;couragement to me, and ought to be none to tho&s;e who tru&s;t in the Lord, and put no confidence in the fle&s;h.</Q>&mdash;In a while &s;aid, <Q>I mu&s;t not expect a relea&s;e but by &s;uffering a due proportion of pain and di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;You may feel &s;ympa|thy with me, but you cannot feel the re|duction which mu&s;t precede a relea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of fifth-day he was rather more light&s;ome, and tried &s;everal things to find what would be&s;t &s;uit his &s;tomach; &s;eem|ed
<PB N="359" REF="032810_0372_0FF53087D08A7B58">
con&s;iderably relieved from the extreme difficulty of breathing, but altered much to|wards evening, and increa&s;ed in weakne&s;s. About one o'clock on &s;ixth-day morning, after &s;uffering great unea&s;ine&s;s, and getting little or no re&s;t, he &s;aid, <Q>O Lord! if it be con&s;i&s;tent with thy holy will, let loo&s;e my bands, and &s;end the moment of relief to my poor body and &s;oul.</Q> Afterwards &s;aid, <Q>We cannot approve or di&s;approve by parts the works of Omnipotence rightly; we mu&s;t approve the whole and &s;ay, Thy will be done in all things.</Q> From one to three he was extremely re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y, from (as he expre&s;&s;ed it) the extreme irritability of the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem, which he &s;aid was as great as could be imagined. At times he rambled a little, but &s;aid, <Q>I find all things mu&s;t be endured. Do you, who judge in the light, judge me for impatience?</Q> I an|&s;wered, quite the rever&s;e, and that we were &s;en&s;ible his bodily di&s;tre&s;s was great, and wi&s;h|ed to alleviate it. He added, <Q>I cannot charge my&s;elf on that account,</Q> meaning impa|tience. About four he &s;eemed in great ago|ny and conflict, turning his head frequently on the pillow; and &s;aid, <Q>Can it be upon any other ground but that the time is come that the purpo&s;e mu&s;t be effected.</Q> Quarter pa&s;t four, he de&s;ired to be turned on his right &s;ide, which &s;eemed a momentary relief. Calling to P. J. he &s;aid, <Q>Make great allow|ance for me, my di&s;tre&s;s is nearly as much as is &s;upportable by human nature.&mdash;Is there no po&s;&s;ibility of my getting any &s;leep? Oh! the
<PB N="360" REF="032810_0373_0FF53031EAB07F50">
pain, the inexpre&s;&s;ible pain of my lungs!</Q> P. J. telling him that, from appearances, there was a likelihood of his being very &s;oon relea&s;ed, perhaps within an hour or two, he replied, <Q>If &s;o, the Lord's name be ble&s;&s;ed and prai&s;ed for ever; I had much rather it were &s;o than otherwi&s;e; for &s;ome time I perceived it ha&s;tening fa&s;t.</Q> Afterwards he added, <Q>The de&s;ire of my heart is, the great ble&s;&s;ing of time and the con&s;olation of eter|nity.</Q> In a while &s;aid to a friend, <Q>Guard again&s;t right hand errors and left hand er|rors; let &s;elf be of no reputation; tru&s;t in the Lord, and he will carry thee through all.</Q></P>
<P>About five he appeared to be wre&s;tling with death; but &s;truggled little con&s;idering his remaining bodily &s;trength. Being a&s;ked to take a little drink, he appeared quite &s;en|&s;ible, and &s;aid, Yes, yes&mdash;Took it, and con|tinued without much &s;truggling until about a quarter before &s;even, when he moved to the &s;ide of the bed, but &s;oon returned to his former po&s;ition; and drew his breath gently &s;horter and &s;horter, until &s;even o'clock, after which he breathed no more, but a&s;cended with joy to his heavenly man&s;ion, and the glory of an incorruptible crown and inherit|ance with the &s;aints in light. His remains were interred on fir&s;t-day, 24th of the 11th month 1793, in Friends burial ground at Ballitore.</P>
