<P>Cur&s;e ye Meroz, &s;aid the Angel of the Lord cur&s;e ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, becau&s;e they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord, again&s;t the mighty.</P></Q>

<P>_THE Sum of the law of nature, as well as of the written law, is love. Love to God and man properly exerci&s;ed in tender feel|ings of the heart, and beneficent actions of life, con&s;titutes perfect holine&s;s. The Go&s;|pel breathes the &s;ame &s;pirit, and acknow|ledges none as the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, but tho&s;e who love (not their friends only) but even their enemies. Ble&s;s and cur&s;e not, is one of the laws of his kingdom. Yet the aver&s;ion of men to this good and bene|volent law, prompts them to frequent violations of it, which is the &s;ource of all the evils we feel or fear: And &s;o lo&s;t are many to all the tender feelings require in this law, as to di&s;cover their enmity to their Creator, by oppo&s;ing the happine&s;s of his creatures, and &s;preading mi&s;ery and ruin among them.</P>
<P>When &s;uch characters as the&s;e pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our view, if we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;pirit of love, required in the law and go&s;pel, we mu&s;t feel a holy abhorrence of them. Love it|&s;elf,

implies hatred to malevolence, and the man who feels no abhorrence of it, may be a&s;&s;ured he is de&s;titute of a benevo|lent temper, and ranks with the enemies of God and man. For as God him&s;elf hates &s;in with a perfect hatred from the e&s;&s;ential holine&s;s of his nature, and &s;inners cannot &s;tand in his &s;ight; &s;o the greater our conformity to him is, the greater will be our abhorrence of tho&s;e per&s;ons and actions which are oppo&s;ite to the divine law. <HI>David</HI> mentions this as an evidence of his love to God: <HI>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with them that ri&s;e up again&s;t thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 139.21, 22.</NOTE> True benevolence is therefore exerci&s;ed in oppo&s;ing tho&s;e who &s;eek the hurt of &s;o|ciety, or even individuals, and none are to be condemned as act|ing again&s;t the law of love, becau&s;e they hate and oppo&s;e &s;uch as are injurious to happine&s;s. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and the puni&s;hment he inflicts on the wicked, ari&s;es from his love of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enevolence of his nature.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the weakne&s;s and corruption of nature, in the be&s;t, is &s;uch, that God hath not entru&s;ted to men at large, the exerci&s;e of the re&s;entment due to &s;uch characters, nor allowed them to inflict tho&s;e puni&s;hments which their crimes call for, even in this world, except in &s;ome &s;pecial ca&s;es. On the contrary he hath &s;trictly prohibited all his &s;ubjects taking vengeance for pri|vate or per&s;onal injuries, in a private and per&s;onal manner, and required that if <HI>one &s;mite us on the one cheek, we turn to him the other al&s;o;</HI> <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Matthew 5.39.</NOTE> and in the language of love exhorts us, <HI>Dearly be|loved, avenge not your&s;elves.</HI> Yet there are ca&s;es in which he re|quires us, as his &s;ervants, to take vengeance on his enemies. And it de&s;erves our particular notice, that all the&s;e ca&s;es re&s;pect crimes which tend to de&s;troy human happine&s;s: Even his com|mands to puni&s;h bla&s;phemy and other &s;ins which &s;trike more directly again&s;t him&s;elf, are not given becau&s;e his own happi|ne&s;s is thereby dimini&s;hed, but becau&s;e they tend to era&s;e from our minds, that &s;en&s;e of his glorious maje&s;ty, authority, and go|vernment, without the belief of which, all order and peace a|mong men would come to an end. So God requires us to ex|ecute vengeance on the murderer, the thief, the adulterer, revi|ler, and the like; all which &s;ins &s;trike at the peace and happine&s;s of human &s;ociety. God's heart is &s;o much &s;et upon diffu&s;ing
<PB N="5" REF="015709_0006_0F99DEC1162E40D0">
happine&s;s among his creatures, by which he mo&s;t eminently di&s;plays his glory, that he perfectly abhors whatever tends to fru&s;trate this end; and has threatened the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition to it with everla&s;ting death in the world to come. But as few (thro' the corruption of nature by &s;in) have &s;aith in a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, &s;ufficient to influence them to their duty, or deter them from oppo&s;ing God's gracious purpo&s;es, therefore to &s;trike our &s;en&s;es with full conviction of his anger again&s;t &s;uch as counteract his benevolent de&s;igns, he has com|manded every &s;ociety of men, to inflict puni&s;hment on them in this world, and has &s;pecified the crimes, the puni&s;hments, and the officers who are to inflict them.</P>
<P>Every puni&s;hment involves in it a cur&s;e, and pre-&s;uppo&s;es &s;ome crime; and the cur&s;e or puni&s;hment is by God, exactly proportioned to the nature, heinou&s;ne&s;s, and circum&s;tances of the crime. Therefore, when a grievous puni&s;hment is inflicted, we ju&s;tly infer the aggravation of the offence. To inflict pu|ni&s;hment, is actively to cur&s;e, and when we pronounce a cur&s;e, we do, as far as we can, con&s;ign over the object to &s;ome puni&s;h|ment. But when God commands us to cur&s;e any per&s;on or people, we are bound by his authority actually to puni&s;h them.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations may lead us to &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of the aggravated nature of the &s;in of <HI>Meroz,</HI> whom <HI>I&s;rael</HI> are com|manded to cur&s;e bitterly for their conduct in an affair of a pub|lic nature.</P>
<P>THE text I have cho&s;en as the theme of my di&s;cour&s;e, is part of a &s;ong uttered by <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak,</HI> in holy triumph and prai&s;e for a &s;ignal victory obtained over <HI>Jabin,</HI> king of <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> and <HI>Si&s;era</HI> the captain of his ho&s;t. This powerful prince, who had nine hundred chariots of iron, and a mighty army, had brought I&s;rael into &s;ubjection, and grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed them for twenty years. This cruel and galling yoke at length awakened them to a &s;en&s;e of their &s;in again&s;t God, and to cry to him for deliverance. No &s;ooner are they made &s;en&s;ible of their &s;in a|gain&s;t, and dependance on him, and to repent and &s;eek his fa|vor and protection, than he appears for their help, rai&s;es up &amp; in|&s;pires <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak</HI> with courage and faith in his power and grace, to oppo&s;e the tyrant, and &s;hake off his yoke. A few men of <HI>Zebulon</HI> and <HI>Naphtali,</HI> viz. ten thou&s;and, were de&s;igned
<PB N="6" REF="015709_0007_0F99DEC124517858">
by God, to have the honor of conquering this potent king; for tho' other tribes mu&s;tered and were ready for the war, yet it &s;eems <HI>Zebulon</HI> and <HI>Naphtali</HI> only, were the people that jeopard|ed their lives to the death, in the high places of the field. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Context ver. 18.</NOTE> With this little army, rai&s;ed from two tribes only out of twelve, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Some people, not the inhabitants of <HI>Meroz,</HI> fear the event of our pre&s;ent &s;trug|gle, (1) on account of our inability, however we may exert our&s;elves, too po&s;e the power of the tyrant; and hence, tho' de&s;irous of freedom, through want of faith in the power and grace of God, dare not act; and &s;o weaken the cau&s;e they wi&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight &s;ucceed. Or (2) They de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s becau&s;e of &s;o many in tho&s;e States, who are lukewarm in the cau&s;e, and &s;ecretly or openly friends to the tyrant.

As to their &s;ins, they had greatly revolted and cho&s;en them new Gods, which was high trea&s;on again&s;t their king. But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e di&s;couragements, we find victory declaring for them on their repentance, and proper exertion of the little power they had. This &s;urely mu&s;t remove all our fears in our pre&s;ent &s;truggle, unle&s;s impenitence and un|belief &s;till rules in our hearts; by which we &s;hall incur the cur&s;e of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></P></NOTE> <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak</HI> march out and wage war again&s;t their op|pre&s;&s;or, for the recovery of their freedom.</P>
<P><HI>Jabin,</HI> it &s;eems, had no knowledge, or thought that I&s;rael was arming again&s;t him. The fir&s;t intelligence brought him, was, that <HI>Barak</HI> was gone up to mount <HI>Tabor,</HI> that he had already marched, and was on his way to invade his country. Some trai|tors, who pretended friend&s;hip to I&s;rael, carried him the news; hoping, doubtle&s;s, to ingratiate them&s;elves with <HI>Jabin,</HI> by giving him the earlie&s;t notice po&s;&s;ible of this revolt.</P>
<P>No doubt, both <HI>Jabin</HI> and <HI>Si&s;era</HI> de&s;pi&s;ed this &s;mall body of undi&s;ciplined, unarmed troops; and were confident they &s;hould carry all before them, and quickly reduce tho&s;e rebels (as he doubtle&s;s termed them) to their former obedience. But God, who di&s;po&s;es of all events, not only gave the victory to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> but utterly de&s;troyed the whole ho&s;t of <HI>Jabin,</HI> that not one e&s;ca|ped, except <HI>Si&s;era</HI> the Captain General, and him God delivered to be &s;lain by the hand of a woman. Women have &s;ometimes been the deliverers of their country; and can, when God in|&s;pires them with courage, face the proude&s;t foe. O how ea&s;y is it with God to &s;ave from the greate&s;t danger, and by the weak|e&s;t in&s;truments, conquer the mo&s;t powerful enemies?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="015709_0008_0F99DEC1E931EDD0"><HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak,</HI> deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of God's mercy in this deliverance, &s;ang this &s;ong as an expre&s;&s;ion of their joy and gratitude: From which, would time allow, many in|&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons might be deduced. But the words of my text lead us more directly to con&s;ider &s;ome things mo&s;t worthy our attention at this day; and therefore I have cho&s;en them as the theme of the following di&s;cour&s;e. And in them we may ob&s;erve:</P>
<P N="1">1. THE crime for which this bitter cur&s;e is denounced on the inhabitants of <HI>Meroz.</HI> Probably this was &s;ome town or State in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who being called to furni&s;h their quota of men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> money for the war, through fear of bad &s;ucce&s;s, and, in that ca&s;e, of a heavier burden; or from a &s;ecret lurch to the enemy, ari&s;ing from hope of Court preferment, or favors already be|&s;towed on &s;ome of their leading men; or from &s;ome other Si|ni&s;ter motive, thought be&s;t to lie &s;till, and not neddle in the quarrel. So much is certain; they did not go with <HI>Barak</HI> to the war. The crime they are charged with, is not their aiding, a&s;&s;i&s;ting, or furni&s;hing the enemy, or holding a &s;ecret corre&s;|pondence with, or taking up arms to help them: They are not charged as laying plots to circumvent the re&s;t, or &s;triving to di&s;courage their neighbours from going to the war; or as ter|rifying others with de&s;criptions of the irre&s;i&s;table power of <HI>Ja|bin's</HI> nine hundred chariots of iron, and the like: No, the inha|bitants of <HI>Meroz</HI> were innocent people, compared to the&s;e; they were only negatively wicked; they only failed in their duty; they did not arm to recover their liberties when wre&s;ted from them by the hand of tyranny. This is all the fault charged on them; yet for this they incurred the fearful cur&s;e in my text. Now, if for mere negligence they de&s;erved this cur&s;e, what mu&s;t they have de&s;erved who aided and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the enemy? &s;urely a &s;even fold bitterer cur&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. OBSERVE the cur&s;e pronounced; <HI>Cur&s;e ye Meroz, cur&s;e ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof.</HI> Their conduct, on that occa&s;ion, was &s;uch as de&s;erved a &s;evere puni&s;hment from the other States, who are commanded to &s;eperate them unto evil, as a ju&s;t reward of their neglect.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE ob&s;erve by whom this cur&s;e was to be pronounced and inflicted. Not by <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak</HI> alone, in a fit of an|ger; as prophane per&s;ons in a rage cur&s;e their neighbours, and

undertake to puni&s;h them; &s;uch often pronounce cur&s;es without cau&s;e; but the cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s &s;hall not come. This cur&s;e was to be pronounced and inflicted by all the people, who are here required to be of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e heart, and engage &s;eriou&s;ly, religiou&s;ly and determinately in cur&s;ing them, and as Gods mini&s;ters, to exe|cute his wrath upon them. We may not &s;uppo&s;e, that this work was left to the people at large, or to a mob; but the ru|lers are fir&s;t to proceed again&s;t them, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is evid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt from the order of Government God e&s;tabli&s;hed in I&s;rael.</NOTE> and all the people to &s;up|port and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in this work; and &s;o all were to join, as one man, to cur&s;e them, and that bitterly, i. e. they were fully and without he&s;itation to condemn them to &s;evere puni&s;hment, and inflict it on them. They were not to deal gingerly with them, nor palliate their offence. They are allowed to make no excu&s;es for them, nor to plead "that they were of a differ|ent opinion, that they thought it their duty not to take up arms again&s;t their king that ruled over them, but to &s;ubmit to the higher powers: That liberty of con&s;cience ought to be allowed to every one, and that it would be hard to puni&s;h them for act|ing their own judgments. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Liberty of con&s;cience is often pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in excu&s;e for the wor&s;t of crimes.

But when actions re&s;pect &s;ociety, and become injurious to the civil rights of men, they are proper &s;ubjects of civil laws, and may he puni&s;hed, notwith&s;tanding the plea for liberty of con&s;cience.</NOTE> No &s;uch pleas might be made for them, nor one word &s;poken in their favour, their &s;in being a|gain&s;t the great law of love and light of nature, but all, with full purpo&s;e of heart, were to cur&s;e tho&s;e cowardly, &s;elfi&s;h cring|ing, lukewarm, half-way, two-faced people, and to treat them as out-ca&s;ts, and unworthy the common protection or &s;ociety of others.</P>
<P N="4">4. OBSERVE b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who&s;e command they were required to cur&s;e <HI>Meroz.</HI> It was not by the command of <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak,</HI> but of God him&s;elf; yea by the command of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the meek and compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour of men. <HI>Cur&s;e ye Meroz, &s;aid the Angel of the Lord.</HI> This was the Angel of God's pre&s;ence, who then fought for <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and who was &s;o offended with the people of <HI>Meroz</HI> for their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and indifference in this im|portant cau&s;e, that he not only cur&s;ed them him&s;elf, but com|mands all the people to cur&s;e them, and inflict his wrath on them in this world.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="9" REF="015709_0010_0F99DEC5B9CAFF88">5 OBSERVE the circum&s;tance which aggravated their crime, <HI>viz.</HI> the enemy that en&s;laved them was mighty. Had the foe been weak and contemptible, there had been le&s;s need of their help. But when a powerful tyrant oppre&s;&s;ed them, and they were called upon to unite with their &s;uffering brethren in &s;hak|ing off his yoke, and all their &s;trength little enough, to oppo&s;e him, then to excu&s;e them&s;elves, was highly criminal, and in ef|fect to join with the tyrant to rivet &s;lavery and mi&s;ery on the whole nation. This was highly provoking to God, who&s;e great end is to diffu&s;e happine&s;s, and not mi&s;ery, among his creatures, and never puni&s;hes, but when his &s;ubjects oppo&s;e this de&s;ign.</P>
<P>THIS was the cri&s;is when their all lay at &s;take. They well knew that their brethren (however they them&s;elves might be di&s;tingui&s;hed with court favours by the tyrant) were groaning under cruel bondage: But as &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s renders people callous and unfeeling to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, &s;o they were ea&s;y and &s;atisfied to &s;ee their brethren tortured by the unrelenting hand of oppre&s;&s;ion, if &s;o be they might &s;leep in a whole &s;kin. They were contented others &s;hould go forth and endure the hard&s;hips of war, but refu&s;ed to engage in the work, or bear any part of the burden with them, though all was hazarded through their neglect. How ba&s;e was this conduct, while they knew the &s;trength of the enemy? This con&s;ideration was enough to have engaged every one, not lo&s;t to all the feelings of humanity, to the firme&s;t union, and the mo&s;t vigorous exertions. But the&s;e &s;ervile wretches would rather bear the yoke, and &s;ee the whole land involved in &s;lavery, than enter the field, and &s;hare the glo|ry of regaining their freedom from a powerful foe.

<P>BUT &s;ince the corruption of nature by &s;in, the lu&s;ts and pa&s;|&s;ions of men &s;o blind their minds, and harden their hearts, that this perfect law of love is little con&s;idered, and le&s;s practi&s;ed; &s;o th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;tate of nature, which would have been a &s;tate of perfect freedom and happine&s;s had man continued in his fir&s;t recti|tude, is a &s;tate of war, rapine and murder.

This is well defined by Dr. Price p. 2. to be "The power of a civil &s;ociety or &s;tate to govern it&s;elf by its own di&s;cretion; or by laws of its own making, without being &s;ubject to any foreign di&s;cretion, or the impo&s;itions of any extraneous power."</NOTE>HENCE it appears, that perfect civil Liberty differs from na|tural, only in this, that in a natural &s;tate our actions, per&s;ons and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, are under the direction, judgment and controul of none but our&s;elves; but in a civil &s;tate, under the direction of others, according to the laws of that &s;tate in which we live; which, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, are perfectly agreeable to the law of nature. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, private judgment; in the &s;econd, the public judgment of the &s;en&s;e of the law of nature is to be the rule of conduct. When this is the ca&s;e, civil Liberty is perfect, and every one enjoys all that freedom which God de&s;igned for his rational creatures in a &s;ocial &s;tate.

<P>NOW if it be unlawful for magi&s;trates in a State, to bind their &s;ubjects by laws contrary to the law of nature, and if in this ca&s;e it is lawful for their &s;ubjects to depo&s;e them; it follows, <HI>a fortiori,</HI> that &s;hould the rulers of one State a&s;&s;ume a power to bind the people of another State, who never intru&s;ted them with a legi&s;lative power, by &s;uch unrighteous laws, tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed people would be under no kind of obligation to &s;ubmit to them; but ought, if in their power, to oppo&s;e them and recover their Liberty.

<P N="2">II. To prove that the cau&s;e of civil Liberty is the cau&s;e of God.</P>
<P>THIS follows from what hath been now &s;aid. For if the law of nature is the law of God; and if God hath given every &s;ociety or State, liberty, independent of all other States, to act according to their own choice in governing them&s;elves, within the bounds of the law of nature; then it follows, that this free|dom is of God; and he that is an advocate for it, e&s;pou&s;es the cau&s;e of God; and he that oppo&s;es it, oppo&s;es God him&s;elf. This Liberty hath God not only given, but entailed on all men, &s;o that they cannot re&s;ign it to any creature without &s;in. There|fore &s;hould any State, through fear, re&s;ign this freedom to a|ny other power, it would be offen&s;ive to God Thus, had <HI>A|merica</HI> &s;ubmitted to, and acquie&s;ced in the declaration of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, <Q>That they have a right to bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever,</Q> we &s;hould have greatly provoked God, by
<PB N="13" REF="015709_0014_0F99DECBF92E90A8">
granting that prerogative to men, which belongs to God only. Nor could we have had rea&s;on to hope for pardon and the Di|vine favour on our land, without unfeigned repentance: But as repentance implies a change of conduct, as well as of mind, &s;o we mu&s;t have exerted our&s;elves to undo what we had done, and by every method in our power, to ca&s;t off the chains, and re|&s;ume our Liberty.</P>
<P>BUT to leave the dim light of rea&s;on, let us hear what Divine revelation &s;ays in my text and context.</P>
<P>ISRAEL were a free, independent common wealth, planted by God in <HI>Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an,</HI> in much the &s;ame manner that he planted us in <HI>America.</HI> The nations around always viewed them with an en|vious and jealous eye: As well they might, &s;ince they drove out &s;even nations more powerful than them&s;elves, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their land. But when by their grievous &s;ins they provoked God, he often permitted tho&s;e neighbouring nations to invade their rights, that they might be brought to a &s;en&s;e of their &s;in and duty.</P>
<P><HI>Jabin</HI> the king of <HI>Canaan,</HI> one of tho&s;e States, was God's rod to humble them. He invaded <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> robbed them of their rights, and held them in &s;lavery twenty years: In all which he acted the part of a cruel tyrant, and provoked God, to his own de&s;truc|tion. <HI>Jabin</HI> had long ruled over <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> but this gave him no right: His dominion was &s;till mere u&s;urpation, as he robbed them of the Liberty God had given them: And with a &s;ingle view to recover this and puni&s;h the invader, God commanded them to wage war on the tyrant, and &s;hake off his yoke. They obey the Divine mandate, a&s;&s;emble their forces, call on the various States to join them in the glorious conflict: And God him&s;elf cur&s;es tho&s;e who would not a&s;&s;i&s;t to puni&s;h this oppre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>No doubt <HI>Jabin</HI> called this Rebellion, and made proclamati|on that all who were found in arms, or any way aiding the re|volt, &s;hould be deemed and treated as rebels, and their e&s;tate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> confi&s;cated; but that all who would make their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, &s;hould enjoy all their priviledges, as before, at his &s;overeign di&s;|po&s;al A glorious offer! How worthy the joyful and thankful acceptance of men born to freedom! Rather, where's the wretch &s;o &s;ordid as not to feel this as an in&s;ult to human nature? or where's the chri&s;tian that does not view it as a reproach of

<P>But doubtle&s;s the&s;e inviting, gracious terms of peace, had great influence on &s;ome. The inhabitants of <HI>Meroz</HI> &s;eem to have been &s;uch da&s;tardly, low-&s;pirited, court &s;ycophants; and al&s;o many in the tribe of <HI>Reuben,</HI> for who&s;e divi&s;ions there were great &s;earchings of heart. The&s;e probably trembled at the power of <HI>Jabin,</HI> and thought him invincible, though oppo&s;ing God him&s;elf, who&s;e cau&s;e they were called to e&s;pou&s;e. Some might call the war rebellion, and others, by open or &s;ecret practi&s;es, di&s;courage and weaken the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS is very applicable to our pre&s;ent ca&s;e. We are declar|ed rebels by the king of <HI>England:</HI> His &s;ervants offer pardon to all who will lay them&s;elves at his feet to di&s;po&s;e of as he &s;hall &s;ee fit, and "to bind them, their children and e&s;tates, at his plea&s;ure, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever." What gracious terms of peace! Mu&s;t not this yoke &s;it with peculiar ea&s;e and plea&s;ure on the necks of free-born <HI>Americans!</HI>&mdash;Yet, with horror be it &s;poken, there are free-born &s;ons of <HI>America,</HI> &s;o lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of honor, Liberty, and every noble feeling, as to join the cry, and pre&s;s for &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. O tell it not in <HI>Gath,</HI> publi&s;h it not in the &s;treets of <HI>A&s;hkelon.</HI></P>
<P>WE have &s;ome, but ble&s;&s;ed be God, that we have no more, of the inhabitants of <HI>Meroz</HI> &s;cattered among us; &s;ome who&s;e endeavours to divide us, cau&s;e great &s;earchings of heart. But be it known to them, and to all men, that they, as <HI>Meroz,</HI> are fighting again&s;t God. This a&s;&s;ertion is confirmed by the cur&s;e denounced on <HI>Meroz</HI> by Gods command; for had they not op|po&s;ed him, he would not have cur&s;ed them. They then were the rebels, in the judgment of God, and not tho&s;e who took up arms to recover their liberties: Rebels again&s;t the God of Hea|ven; and therefore fell under his, and his people's cur&s;e; as all tho&s;e &s;hall, who oppo&s;e, or neglect to promote the like glorious cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="015709_0016_0F99DECD2916C0C8">FROM what hath been &s;aid, the truth of the &s;econd ob&s;erva|tion appears; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>II. THAT to take arms, and repel force by force, when our Liberties are invaded, is well plea&s;ing to God.</P>
<P>THIS is a natural con&s;equence from what is &s;aid above, and from the text it&s;elf. <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak,</HI> in taking arms again&s;t <HI>Jabin,</HI> acted agreeable to the law of nature, which is the law of love; were al&s;o particularly excited, directed and commanded thereto by God him&s;elf. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judges, 4.6, 7.</NOTE> They did not by this war, aim at dominion over others, nor &s;eek to deprive any of their natural rights; but only to recover and &s;ecure the Liberties and rights which had been wre&s;ted from them; that they might thereby &s;pread peace and happine&s;s through all the tribes of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> while the real happine&s;s of others would not thereby be dimini&s;hed. This, by the law of nature, was &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify them. If then they conformed to the law of love in taking up arms; and if God required them to make war on <HI>Jabin;</HI> then it was unde|niably plea&s;ing to him. But if God approved their conduct in this ca&s;e, he certainly will approve the like conduct in all &s;imilar ca&s;es Therefore when one country or State invades the liber|ties of another; it is lawful and well plea&s;ing to God for the op|pre&s;&s;ed to defend their rights by force of arms: Yea, to neglect this, when there is a rational pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, is a &s;in, a &s;in a|gain&s;t God, and di&s;covers a want of that benevolence, and de&s;ire of the happine&s;s of our fellow creatures, which is the highe&s;t glory of the &s;aints.</P>
<P>I need not &s;pend time to prove that our &s;truggle with <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is very &s;imilar to that of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> with <HI>Jabin.</HI> As they had, &s;o have we been long oppre&s;&s;ed by a power that never had any equitable right to our land, or to rule over us, but by our own con&s;ent, and agreeable to a &s;olemn compact. When they vio|lated this, all their right cea&s;ed; and they could have no better claim to dominion, than <HI>Jabin</HI> had over <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> A power in|deed has been u&s;urped by the court of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> "to bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever: Which claim hath already produ|ced many mo&s;t unrighteous and oppre&s;&s;ive laws, which they have attempted to inforce by their fleets and armies: In all which they can be no more ju&s;tified, than <HI>Jabin</HI> in his tyranny over <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> Therefore if it was their duty to fight for the recovery
<PB N="16" REF="015709_0017_0F99DECE30ACE830">
of their freedom, it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be ours. And to neglect this, when called to it by the public voice, will expo&s;e us to the cur&s;e of <HI>Meroz.</HI> Yea,</P>
<P>III. It is lawful, yea duty, to levy war again&s;t tho&s;e who op|pre&s;s us, even when they are not in arms again&s;t us, if there be a rational probability of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, if there be a rational probability of &s;ucce&s;s. For the law of love or nature will not ju&s;tify oppo&s;ition to the greate&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, when &s;uch oppo&s;ition mu&s;t be attended with greater evils than &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Therefore the primitive chri&s;tians, and many of later ages, did not oppo&s;e their cruel per&s;ecutors; as it would, without a miracle, have brought on them inevitable de|&s;truction. But where there is a rational probability of &s;ucce&s;s, any people may lawfully, and it is their duty, to levy war on tho&s;e who rob them of their rights, whether they be rulers in the State they live in, or any more di&s;tant powers, even before war is waged again&s;t them.</P>
<P>THE truth of this appears from the in&s;tance before us. <HI>Ja|bin,</HI> at this time was not at war with <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> no, they had been conquered and under his government twenty years; and nothing was heard, but the groans and cries of the oppre&s;&s;ed. How then, it may be a&s;ked, can they be ju&s;tified in commencing a war?&mdash;Doubtle&s;s they had often petitioned for redre&s;s of griev|ances, as we have done, and to as little purpo&s;e. What more could they do in a peaceable way?&mdash;They were reduced to the dreadful alternative, either tamely to &s;ubmit them&s;elves and chil|dren after them, to the galling yoke of mercile&s;s tyranny; or wage war on the tyrant. The la&s;t was the mea&s;ure God ap|proved, and therefore, by a &s;pecial command, enjoined it on them. This we are &s;ure be would not have done, had it been offen&s;ive to him. He did not require <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to wait till <HI>Jabin</HI> had invaded their country and &s;truck the fir&s;t blow, (as we did in re&s;pect to our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> oppre&s;&s;ors.) but while all was peace in his kingdom, for ought we find, God commands <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to rai&s;e an army, and invade the tyrant's dominions.</P>
<P>THE moral rea&s;on of this is obvious: For u&s;urpation or op|pre&s;&s;ion, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> offen&s;ive war, already levied. Any State which u&s;urps a power over another State, or rulers who, by a wanton u&s;e of
<PB N="17" REF="015709_0018_0F99DED2485E22B8">
their power, oppre&s;s their &s;ubjects, do thereby break the peace, and commence an offen&s;ive war. In &s;uch a ca&s;e oppo&s;ition is mere &s;elf-defence, and is no more criminal, yea as really our duty, as to defend our&s;elves again&s;t a murderer, or high-way-robber. Self-pre&s;ervation is an in&s;tinct, by God, implanted in our nature: Therefore we &s;in again&s;t God and nature, when we tamely re&s;ign our rights to tyrants, or quietly &s;ubmit to pub|lic oppre&s;&s;ors, if it be in our power to defend our&s;elves.</P>
<P>A rebel indeed is a mon&s;ter in nature; an enemy, not only to his country, but to all mankind: He is de&s;titute of that bene|volence which is the highe&s;t honor and glory of the rational na|ture.&mdash;But what is a rebel? What tho&s;e actions for which a man or people de&s;erve this opprobrious charge?&mdash;Tho&s;e only are rebels who are enemies to good government, and oppo&s;e &s;uch as duly execute it. A &s;tate of nature is a &s;tate of war. Civil government, which is founded in the con&s;ent of &s;ociety to be governed by certain laws framed for the general good, and duly executed by &s;ome appointed thereto, puts an end to this State, and &s;ecures peace and &s;afety. He therefore who tran&s;gre&s;&s;es this compact, even he oppo&s;es good government, and is a rebel, <HI>re|bellat,</HI> he rai&s;es war again.</P>
<P>IN this, it matters not whether the per&s;on be a king or a &s;ub|ject; he is the rebel that breaks the compact, he renews the war, and is the aggre&s;&s;or: And every member of the body-politic, is bound, by the eternal law of benevolence, to &s;et him&s;elf again&s;t him, and if he per&s;i&s;ts, the whole mu&s;t unite to root him from the earth, whether he be high or low, rich or poor, a king or a &s;ubject. The latter indeed le&s;s de&s;erves it, by how much le&s;s mi&s;chief he is capable of doing. But when a king or ruler turns rebel, (which is va&s;tly more frequent in proportion to their num|bers) being armed with power, he ever &s;preads de&s;olation and mi&s;ery around his dominions, before he can be regularly and properly puni&s;hed; and therefore is proportionably higher in guilt: Witne&s;s <HI>Pharaoh, Saul, Mana&s;&s;eh, Antiochus, Julian, Charles the fir&s;t,</HI> of ble&s;&s;ed memory, and <HI>George the third,</HI> who vies with the chief in this black catalogue, in &s;preading mi&s;ery and ruin round the world.</P>
<P>THE ruler who invades the civil or religious rights of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubjects, levies war on them, puts them out of his protection,

<P>IF the&s;e ob&s;ervations are true (and they cannot be denied with mode&s;ty) then it is as lawful, and as &s;trongly our duty to pro|&s;ecute a war again&s;t the king of <HI>England</HI> for invading our rights and liberties, as to bring an ob&s;tinate rebel to ju&s;tice, or take arms again&s;t &s;ome foreign power that might invade us.

The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors are enemies to the great law of nature, and to the happine&s;s of mankind. For this, God commanded <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to commence a war again&s;t <HI>Jabin,</HI> that, being free from his pow|er, happine&s;s and peace might be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>IN our conte&s;t with the tyrant of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> we did not indeed commence the war: No: But tho' under a load of al|mo&s;t in&s;upportable in&s;ult, abu&s;e and reproach, we rai&s;ed our humble and earne&s;t petitions, and prayed only for Peace, Liber|ty and Safety, the natural rights of all men.

their rights? But for this God commanded <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to make war on him, and pronounces a heavy cur&s;e on tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to join in carrying it on. This leads me to &s;hew,</P>
<P>IV. THAT tho&s;e who are indolent, and backward to take up arms and exert them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of their country, in or|der to recover and &s;ecure their freedom, when called thereto by the public voice, are highly criminal in the &s;ight of God and man.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine is wrapt up in the very bowels of my text. <HI>Cur&s;e ye Meroz, &s;aid the Angel of the Lord, cur&s;e ye bitterly the in|habitants thereof, becau&s;e they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord again&s;t the mighty.</HI> The cur&s;e of God falls on none but for &s;in; for he delights in ble&s;&s;ing, and not in cur&s;ing. And he never permits any of his &s;ubjects to execute his cur&s;es on their fellow &s;ubjects, but where the crime is highly aggravat|ed; much le&s;s does he allow them to cur&s;e them bitterly, unle&s;s their guilt is exceeding great. Now &s;ince God commands <HI>I&s;ra|el</HI> to cur&s;e <HI>Meroz</HI> bitterly, we fairly infer, that their &s;in was of a crim&s;on dye, and mo&s;t provoking to him and his people. And whoever is guilty of the like conduct in our conte&s;t with <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> incurs the like g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</P>
<P>THIS needs no further proof. For if it be allowed, that the &s;tate of the ca&s;e between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> is, in its main parts, parallel with that between <HI>Jabin</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as hath been &s;hewn, then the crime of negligence is as heinous in this &s;truggle as in that.

<P>BUT not to make our ca&s;e appear better than it really is; I fear there are many among us, in one di&s;gui&s;e or other, who, when &s;tript of their vizards, will appear to be of the inhabitants of <HI>Meroz;</HI> and who, if their characters were ju&s;tly drawn, would &s;ecretly, if not openly &s;ay, as the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> in another ca&s;e, <HI>In &s;aying this, thou reproache&s;t us al&s;o.</HI> But as birds which are hit, &s;how it by their fluttering, and it may &s;erve to bring &s;uch con|temptible characters to view, and expo&s;e them to the cur&s;e they de&s;erve, and on the other hand, may convince &s;ome real friends to freedom, of their &s;inful negligence in the common cau&s;e, I will venture to point out a few.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e characters, I do not include &s;uch as aid, or in words or actions defend, or openly declare for the enemy, and plead the right of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> "to bind us in all ca&s;es what|&s;oever." Of &s;uch there are not many among us; owing pro|bably to their fear of a va&s;t majority, which is on the &s;ide of freedom; and therefore they put on the gui&s;e of friend&s;hip, while they endeavor &s;ecretly to work de&s;truction to the cau&s;e. The&s;e may be known by the following marks.</P>
<P N="1">1. Ob&s;erve the man who will neither go him&s;elf, nor contri|bute of his &s;ub&s;tance (if able) to encourage others to go into the war. Such do what in them lays to break up the army: The&s;e incur the cur&s;e of <HI>Meroz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Others will expre&s;s wi&s;hes for our &s;ucce&s;s, but will be &s;ure to back them with doubts of the event, and fears of a heavier yoke.

<P N="4">4. OTHERS, who talk much for liberty, you will find ever oppo&s;ing the mea&s;ures of defence propo&s;ed; making objections to them, and &s;hewing their incon&s;i&s;tency; while they offer none in their &s;tead, or only &s;uch as tend to embarra&s;s the main de|&s;ign: They are &s;o prudent, that they will wa&s;te away days, yea months to con&s;ider; and are ever full of their wi&s;e cautions; but never zealous to execute any important project. When &s;uch men get into public &s;tations; e&s;pecially if they fill a &s;eat in our public councils, they greatly endanger the State; they protract bu&s;ine&s;s, and often defeat the be&s;t councils. Prudence and moderation are amiable virtues, and the mode&s;t mind feels pain on being &s;u&s;pected as &s;anguine, ra&s;h and imprudent. This gives the over prudent great advantage to ob&s;truct every vigo|rous mea&s;ure, which they brand with the name of ra&s;hne&s;s: And every friend to vigorous action feels the reflection, who, without great fortitude, &s;its down aba&s;hed, and with grief &s;ees his coun&s;els defeated. But if the mea&s;ure be adopted, the next motion of the prudent man is, to delay the execution, that the happy moment, on which all depends, may be lo&s;t. <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><P>We have a remarkable in&s;tance of this nature in 2.

<P N="6">6. THERE are others who in heart wi&s;h well to our cau&s;e, but through fear of the power of our enemies, they are back|ward to join vigorou&s;ly to &s;upport it; they really wi&s;h we might &s;ucceed, but they dread the hard&s;hips of a campaign, and choo&s;e &s;o to conduct, that, on whatever &s;ide victory may declare, they may be &s;afe.</P>
<P N="7">7. OTHERS wi&s;h well to the public cau&s;e, but have a much greater value for their own private and per&s;onal intere&s;t.

<P>ALL the&s;e, and many others of the like kind, might doubt|le&s;s have been found in <HI>Meroz,</HI> and yet the be&s;t of them all fell under this bitter cur&s;e: For whatever were their private &s;enti|ments, they all led to the i&s;&s;ue, viz. to keep them back from tho&s;e vigorous efforts that the cau&s;e of liberty then required, and for want of which, it was greatly hazarded. And whatever motives influence men at this day, whether a de&s;ire of ea&s;e, hope of power, honor, or wealth; if they do any thing again&s;t, or neglect to a&s;&s;i&s;t all in their power, the glorious cau&s;e of freedom, now in our hands, they, in a greater or le&s;s degree, incur the cur&s;e of <HI>Meroz.</HI> Now, if ever, is that text to be applied to &s;uch, <HI>Cur&s;ed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully; and cur&s;ed be he that holdeth back his &s;word from blood.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah 48 10.</NOTE> This leads me</P>

<P>THE &s;ingle crime of <HI>Meroz</HI> is &s;aid to be this. When they were called to arm in order to &s;hake off the yoke of tyranny, they did not join in the glorious cau&s;e.
