<HEAD>CHAP. I. ON BAPTISM.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN the Bapti&s;t was &s;ent as a voice crying in the wilderne&s;s, to proclaim the approach of the Me&s;&s;iah; to point him out, upon his per&s;onal appearance, to the people; to preach the nece&s;&s;ity of repentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins; and to baptize with water, as prefiguring the &s;piritual admini&s;tration of the Saviour under the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, in baptizing with the Holy Gho&s;t, to the purification of &s;ouls, and fitting them for an eternal inheritance with the &s;aints in light.</P>
<P>John came not to in&s;titute, but to precede and prepare the way for, this glorious di&s;pen&s;ation; he therefore repre&s;ented the new covenant of the Prince of life and peace, under the title of <HI>the kingdom of heaven,</HI> which he declared to be <HI>at hand,</HI> or near to take place.</P>
<P>This go&s;pel-e&s;tabli&s;hment the prophet Jeremiah had foretold, &s;hould<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxi. 32.</NOTE> <HI>not be according to the old covenant</HI> of &s;ymbolical forms and &s;hadows, which the in&s;pired author of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews
<PB N="4" REF="019924_0003_0FE1A344B5A21658">ob&s;erved,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 9, 10.</NOTE> <Q>could not make him that did the &s;ervice perfect, as pertaining to the con&s;cience;</Q> becau&s;e it <Q>&s;tood only in meats and drinks, and divers wa&s;hings, and carnal ordinances, impo&s;ed on them until the time of reformation.</Q></P>
<P>John's bapti&s;m, being of the &s;ame exterior nature with the rituals of the law, could no more add towards the purification of the heart, and the perfection of a good con&s;cience, than they: like them, it was <HI>a figure for the time then pre&s;ent,</HI> to &s;hadow forth the internal effect of the Lord's bap|ti&s;m, but no further requi&s;ite thereunto. John knowing this, when Je&s;us came to partake of his bapti&s;m, as he likewi&s;e did of the ordinances of the law (not that he might give a &s;anction to their continuance, but that he might <HI>fulfil</HI> them, as having been primarily of divine authority, and not yet di&s;annulled) appeared &s;urprized that he whom he knew to be the inward and effectual baptizer, &s;hould apply to him for his outward bapti&s;m, &s;aying,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mat. iii. 14, 15.</NOTE> <Q>I have need to be baptized of thee, and come&s;t thou to me?</Q> but upon our Lord's an&s;|wering, "Suffer it to be &s;o <HI>now,</HI>" (which intimated his own &s;piritual bapti&s;m was not yet to commence, &s;o as to put a final period to that of John) he admitted it; and &s;oon after directed his hearers to him, &s;aying,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">John i. 29.</NOTE> <Q>Behold the Lamb of God, Which <HI>taketh away the &s;in of the world.</HI></Q></P>
<P>For this gracious end, the Son of God re&s;igned him&s;elf up to become<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">I Tim. ii. 6.</NOTE> <HI>a ran&s;om for all mankind, to be te&s;tified,</HI> or outwardly verified, <HI>in due time,</HI> by which he &s;hewed the love of God to fallen man, and his willingne&s;s to pardon &s;inners upon their repentance; in order to which, he <Q><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxviii. 18.</NOTE> received gifts for men; yea for the rebellious al&s;o, that the
<PB N="5" REF="019924_0004_0FE1A34637AA4268">Lord God might dwell among them.</Q> Hence<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">I Cor. xii. 7.</NOTE> <Q>the manife&s;tation of the &s;pirit is given to <HI>every man,</HI> to pro&s;it withal;</Q> that on their embracing it, in faith and obedience, the might, by its baptizing power and virtue, be delivered from the condem|nation due for &s;ins committed, and be clean&s;ed from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>To this import are the following expre&s;&s;ions of John;<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mat. iii. 11, 12.</NOTE> <Q>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me (or who&s;e mini&s;tration &s;hall &s;ucceed mine) is mightier than I, who&s;e &s;hoes I am not worthy to bear, he &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with fire; who&s;e fan is in his Hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into his garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</Q> John here &s;hews the true di&s;tinction betwixt his own bapti&s;m, and that of our Saviour: the fir&s;t with water; the la&s;t with the Holy Gho&s;t; and al&s;o metaphorically inculcates, that the bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t &s;hould winnow the &s;oul of its chaffy, or &s;inful nature, and operate as fire, to the perfect con&s;umption of all its defilement.</P>
<P><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">John iii. 30.</NOTE> <Q>He mu&s;t increa&s;e, &s;aid John, but I mu&s;t decrea&s;e.</Q> This indicates, that as the &s;piritual mini&s;tration of Chri&s;t &s;hould advance, John's watery one &s;hould recede; not be joined with it. Neither was the regenerating bapti&s;m of the &s;pirit con&s;equent upon it when admini&s;tered; for the<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Acts viii.</NOTE> Samaritans received the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ome time <HI>after</HI> their water bapti&s;m;<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 47.</NOTE> Cornelius and his friends received it <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">;</HI> and<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Acts viii.</NOTE> Simon the &s;orcerer received it <HI>not at all,</HI> though he was baptized with water.</P>
<P>Spirit-bapti&s;m, therefore, is not connected with water-bapti&s;m, nor at all dependant upon it. The
<PB N="6" REF="019924_0005_0FE1A357710940D0">bapti&s;m of the Saviour is complete in it&s;elf, without exterior form and &s;hadow. By its renewed impre&s;|&s;ions on the believing and attentive &s;oul, the new|birth of the &s;pirit is brought forth therein, and in proportion to its growth and increa&s;e, the old man, with his corrupt deeds, becomes crucified, and the &s;oul delivered, and rai&s;ed up into newne&s;s of life.</P>
<P>This is the bapti&s;m which is e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation, as our Lord gave Nicodemus to under&s;tand, when he &s;aid,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">John iii.</NOTE> <Q>Except a Man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</Q> And again, <Q>Except a man be born of water and of the &s;pirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</Q> The word <HI>water</HI> here, like that of <HI>fire,</HI> Mat. iii. 12. is u&s;ed to &s;ignify the purifying virtue of the &s;pirit in the regeneration of the &s;oul.</P>
<P><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Liberty of Prophe&s;ying, page 231.</NOTE> Bi&s;hop Taylor &s;aith, <Q>The water and the &s;pirit in this place &s;ignify the &s;ame thing; and by water is meant the effect of the &s;pirit clean&s;ing and puri|fying the &s;oul, as appears in its parallel of Chri&s;t baptizing with the &s;pirit and fire.</Q></P>
<P>That our Lord meant it of the &s;pirit only, &s;uffici|ently appears from his own explanatory expre&s;&s;ion, ver&s;e 6. <Q>That which is born of the fle&s;h, is fle&s;h; and that which is born of the &s;pirit, is &s;pirit.</Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who advocate the continuance of water|bapti&s;m, plead our Saviour's commi&s;&s;ion, Mathew xxviii. 19. but he there makes no mention of water, nor do his words imply it; for his expre&s;&s;ions are &s;uch as &s;uit only with his own &s;piritual bapti&s;m. Neither did his Di&s;ciples from thence begin the practice of water-bapti&s;in. They had taken it up &s;ome time before, mo&s;t probably from John's exam|ple, whom they ju&s;tly venerated as a me&s;&s;enger &s;ent from God, and in great e&s;timation with their Lord
<PB N="7" REF="019924_0006_0FE1A43E7417C120">and ma&s;ter; for they admini&s;tered it after the &s;ame manner he did, and &s;o continued to do, when they u&s;ed it after our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion, as well as before. Whereas, if they had under&s;tood his command to intend water-bapti&s;m, they would certainly have altered their terms, and have admini&s;tered it in the very words of his commi&s;&s;ion, which we do not find in holy writ they ever did. It was therefore &s;till John's bapti&s;m in nature, and far below the effectual bapti&s;m of the great Me&s;&s;iah; who, notwith&s;tanding he bore &s;uch honourable te&s;timony concering John, as a burning and &s;hining light, and one of the greate&s;t prophets born of woman, as being his immediate forerunner, yet, at the &s;ame time he &s;aid,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Luke vii. 23.</NOTE> <Q>He that is lea&s;t in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.</Q> This implies that the lowe&s;t attainment in the &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation of Chri&s;t, is &s;uperior in nature to the highe&s;t in John's mini&s;tra|tion: this being but the temporary &s;ign, and that the &s;ub&s;tantial and permanent reality &s;ignified by it.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider what the commi&s;&s;ion was, and to whom it was given. It appears to have been merely verbal; for we find it was not immediately attended with the authority requi&s;ite to its execution. The qualification &s;till nece&s;&s;ary was the in&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t, which the di&s;ciples were to receive afterwards; without which they were not to enter upon the work of the mini&s;try, but to wait in patience for its illuminating and powerful virtue, to put them forth, and to abilitate them for the &s;ervice.<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiv. 49.</NOTE> "Behold," &s;aid the great Mini&s;ter of the &s;anctuary, <Q>I &s;end the promi&s;e of my Father upon you; but tarry ye in the city of Jeru&s;alem, until ye be endued with power from on high. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Acts i. 5.</NOTE> John truly baptized with water; but ye &s;hall be
<PB N="8" REF="019924_0007_0FE1A43FF8C95E68">baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t not many days hence."&mdash;<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid v. 8.</NOTE> "Ye &s;hall receive power after that the Holy Gho&s;t is come upon you, and ye &s;hall be witne&s;&s;es unto me, both in Jeru&s;alem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the utter|mo&s;t part of the earth.</Q></P>
<P>Thus was the &s;piritual bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t, which had been predicted by John, to commence, and tho&s;e who mini&s;tered, were to <HI>teach baptizing</HI> into the &s;ame &s;pirit them&s;elves were baptized with. Unle&s;s the mini&s;ters were baptized with the &s;pirit, they could not baptize their believing hearers with it; nor could their hearers without faith receive it.</P>
<P>This appears to be the bapti&s;m intended in the commi&s;&s;ion; for it relates not to the bapti&s;m of John, but to that of Chri&s;t, and holds forth <HI>the preaching of the go&s;pel in the &s;pirit and power of God.</HI> Therefore the commi&s;&s;ion was given to tho&s;e in the primitive age, who were divinely in&s;pired for that purpo&s;e, and it unque&s;tionably reaches to all influenced by THE SAME SPIRIT, and to &s;uch only, to the end of the world.</P>
<P>The words of the commi&s;&s;ion are,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii. 19.</NOTE> <Q>Go ye, and teach all nations, baptizing them, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>into the name</HI> of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> The word <HI>name</HI> here is not to be under&s;tood literally, but of that divine power, virtue, and heavenly influence, which em|phatically denotes and characterizes the Godhead above all other beings; which our Lord often expre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame word. John xvii. 6. <Q>I have manife&s;ted thy <HI>name</HI> unto the men thou gave&s;t me;" ver. 12. "I kept them in thy <HI>name;"</HI> and ver&s;e 11. he prayed, "Holy Father, keep through thine own <HI>name,</HI> tho&s;e thou ha&s;t given
<PB N="9" REF="019924_0008_0FE1A447C251C3E8">me!</Q> In this name is &s;trength and &s;alvation.<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Prov. xviii. 10.</NOTE> <Q>The name of the Lord is a &s;trong tower, the righteous runneth into it, and is &s;afe.</Q> The knowledge of it gives faith,<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm ix. 10.</NOTE> <Q>They that know thy name will put their tru&s;t in thee.</Q> It is the con&s;olating unction from the Holy One.<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Cant. i. 3.</NOTE> <Q>Thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore do the virgins (the cha&s;te in heart) love thee.</Q> Into the internal virtue and influence of this &s;acred and all-&s;ufficient name, or &s;pirit, are all the truly rege|nerate mea&s;urably baptized; for,<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 9.</NOTE> <Q>If any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his.</Q></P>
<P>The apo&s;tles, with many of the primitive brethren, received this <HI>bapti&s;m into the name,</HI> or &s;pirit, of the Godhead to a high degree, which enabled them to <HI>teach baptizing</HI> with &s;uch efficacy, that multitudes<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Aris ii. 37.</NOTE> were <HI>pricked in their heart,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Acts iv. 33.</NOTE> <Q>and with <HI>great power</HI> gave the apo&s;tles witne&s;s of the re&s;urrection of the Lord Je&s;us,</Q> &s;o that even<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid vi. 10.</NOTE> their enemies were not able to re&s;i&s;t the wi&s;dom and the &s;pirit by which they &s;pake.</P>
<P>Peter relating the re&s;ult of his vi&s;it to Cornelius, and his company, about eight years after the great effu&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t at the time of Pente|co&s;t, thus te&s;tifies to its baptizing power in the true mini&s;try of the word:<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid xi. 15. 16.</NOTE> <Q>As I began to &s;peak, the Holy Gho&s;t fell on them, as on us in the begin|ning. Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he &s;aid, John indeed baptized with water; but ye &s;hall be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> This plainly &s;hews, that the &s;piritual bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t accompanied their preach|ing, and therefore was the bapti&s;m intended in his commi&s;&s;ion. The &s;ame apo&s;tle al&s;o witne&s;&s;es more
<PB N="10" REF="019924_0009_0FE1A4494ABD5038">generally,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Peter i. 12.</NOTE> that the go&s;pel was preached <HI>with the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ent down from heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Some object, that it is not in the power of men, but of God only, to baptize with the Holy Gho&s;t. But let &s;uch con&s;ider, that he is plea&s;ed to work in&s;trumentally, as well as immediately; and though, in a common way of expre&s;&s;ion, we may &s;ay, the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t baptize with the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t; it is no more meant that they can do it in their own wills, or by their own powers, than it was &s;o intended of the primitive mini&s;ters, who are &s;aid to work miracles. To the Lord alone is the power and glory of all to be attributed. He is the &s;ole effector of all good, and the be&s;t of men are but his in&s;truments when he is plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of them; yet by a metonymy of the in&s;trument for the power that u&s;eth it, it is u&s;ual to &s;ay, &s;uch a per&s;on in&s;tantly made the cripple to walk, healed the di&s;ea&s;ed, or conferred the Holy Gho&s;t, without any intention to attribute that to man which is only due to God.</P>
<P><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">John xv. 5.</NOTE> "Without me," &s;aid our Lord to his di&s;ciples "ye can do nothing." But when he had endued them with the &s;pirit,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 5.</NOTE> <HI>they mini&s;tered the &s;pirit,</HI> as well as the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity; for true go&s;pel mini&s;try is not that of words only, but of <HI>words with power.</HI> Therefore the true mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel always baptizeth, more or le&s;s, in his mini&s;try according to the mea&s;ure of divine influence upon him; who without it would be only as &s;alt without &s;avour, however he might be furni&s;hed with &s;cho|la&s;tic argument and human eloquence. The&s;e may entertain the head, and move the pa&s;&s;ions, which is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of an in&s;pired mini&s;ter; but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubject them, and to in&s;truct, and quicken the &s;oul into an inward &s;en&s;e of the effective power and virtue

<P>Our Lord con&s;tantly gave his followers an exam|ple of this <HI>bapti&s;mal teaching</HI> in his own practice; which induced his hearers to confe&s;s, that he taught<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 29</NOTE> <HI>with authority,</HI> and not as the &s;cribes. They were a&s;toni&s;hed at his doctrine; for<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Luke iv. 32.</NOTE> his word was <HI>with power.</HI> The &s;cribes had human authority, but his was divine; which &s;o &s;truck even the officers &s;ent by the chief prie&s;ts and phari&s;ees to take him, that they excu&s;ed them&s;elves by &s;aying,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">John vii. 46.</NOTE> <Q>Never man &s;pake like this man.</Q> This was unque&s;|tionably true; for if any other &s;poke the &s;ame words, none could enforce them with the &s;ame fulne&s;s of divine power and authority. Thus he led the way to what he afterwards commi&s;&s;ioned and empowered his di&s;ciples to do, in the mea&s;ure he afforded them re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle Paul undoubtedly had an equal &s;hare in the go&s;pel commi&s;&s;ion with any other in&s;pired mini&s;ter, and was equally bound to baptize in the &s;en&s;e intended therein; but, with water, he declared<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Cor. i. 17.</NOTE> <HI>he was not &s;ent to baptize:</HI> con&s;equently, water-bapti&s;m was not the bapti&s;m enjoined in the commi&s;&s;ion.

<P>Many have been trained up to believe, that our Saviour made water-bapti&s;n the condition of our admittance into his kingdom. Were it &s;o, the &s;al|vation of all mankind depends upon it; and if the &s;prinkling or dipping of infants be, either the &s;av|ing bapti&s;m, or the &s;ole means through which it is to be received, the &s;alvation of the child who dies before it attains to years of under&s;tanding, or power of choice, depends upon the precarious conduct of its parents, or that of others, without any will, knowledge, or default of its own.</P>
<P>But what rational and con&s;iderate per&s;on can believe, that the ju&s;t Creator, and kind Saviour of mankind, is &s;o void of equity and commi&s;eration, as to &s;uffer tho&s;e innocents who die in their infancy, to fall into everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, for the want of a ceremonial, which, if it be a duty, cannot be theirs, but that of their parents, or of tho&s;e who have the care of their concerns upon them, and who&s;e omi&s;|&s;ion mu&s;t be their fault, if it be any, and not that of the children, who can be no way chargeable with it? The &s;olemn denunciation of the great God, who affords of his<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 11.</NOTE> <HI>&s;aving grace unto all men,</HI> is,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xviii. 20</NOTE> <Q>The &s;oul <HI>that &s;inneth,</HI> it &s;hall die.

<P>The tender infant hath neither ability to receive a law, nor to tran&s;gre&s;s it, therefore it cannot be guilty of the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in; and to hold it guilty, becau&s;e its primogenitors tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed long before it exi&s;ted, and that it is ju&s;tly puni&s;hable merely for de&s;cending from them in the &s;tate of their fallen nature, which it could not avoid, is too barbarous for truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s to warrant.

<P><HI>Fidus,</HI> an <HI>African</HI> bi&s;hop in the third century, advi&s;ed the bapti&s;m of infants for the purgation of original &s;in, alledging that the Jews circumci&s;ed theirs. This at fir&s;t &s;eemed new and &s;trange to <HI>Cyprian;</HI> but he afterwards fell in with a collection of 66 bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters, who enjoined it. The practice became preached up afterwards by divers <HI>as nece&s;&s;ary;</HI> and the <HI>Milevitan</HI> and <HI>Carthagenian</HI> coun|cils, in the fore part of the fifth century, went &s;o far as to fix an <HI>anathema</HI> upon all who held that young children might be &s;aved without water-bap|ti&s;m; which was ratified by &s;everal &s;ucceeding popes. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> carried the matter &s;till further, teaching that even embryos, if they had been quickened in the mother's womb, and there died unbaptized, were damned, as guilty of original &s;in. This put the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of the prie&s;thood upon contriving a remedy: &s;ome they took up out of their graves, and <HI>chri&s;tened,</HI> as they &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly called it, the dead body: others they baptized by <HI>proxy,</HI> in imitation of tho&s;e early mi&s;led profe&s;&s;ors among the <HI>Corinthi|ans,</HI> who al&s;o doubted of the re&s;urrection; in proof of which, the apo&s;tle doubly argued with them;

<PB N="16" REF="019924_0015_0FE1A45A2A607ED8">after the manner of the Jewi&s;h law, had he not held it nece&s;&s;ary; yet we find Paul openly reproved him for it. This &s;hews, that Peter, though one of the mo&s;t eminent apo&s;tles, in the early time of the go&s;pel, &s;ometimes went a little too far, in com|pliance with the prejudices of his Jewi&s;h brethren, divers of whom were pre&s;ent when he commanded tho&s;e Gentile convert, to be baptized. But in this particular in&s;tance at the hou&s;e of Cornelius, Peter might not be blameable; for we have rea&s;on to believe, that &s;uch a prudential tenderne&s;s both to|wards Jews and Gentiles, was permitted for a &s;ea|&s;on, as to allow the practice of divers rituals, till their attachment to them &s;hould become le&s;&s;ened, by the prevalence of the Holy &s;pirit in their hearts.</P>
<P>Upon this ground he probably exhorted the peo|ple, Acts ii. 38, 39. <Q>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of your &s;ins, and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. For <HI>the promi&s;e</HI> is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off.</Q></P>
<P>This <HI>general promi&s;e</HI> he had thus cited from Joel in the beginning of his di&s;cour&s;e: <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> <Q>It &s;hall come to pa&s;s in the la&s;t days, &s;aith God, I will pour out of my &s;pirit upon all fle&s;h, and your &s;ons and your daughters &s;hall prophe&s;y, and your young men &s;hall &s;ee vi&s;ions, and your old men &s;hall dream dreams: and on my &s;ervants, and on my hand|maidens, I will pour out in tho&s;e days of my &s;pirit, and they &s;hall prophe&s;y.</Q></P>
<P>This di&s;pen&s;ation of the &s;pirit to both &s;exes, then eminently took place, and the apo&s;tle, undoubtedly, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the words before-cited, with allu&s;ion to the &s;piritual bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t, which
<PB N="17" REF="019924_0016_0FE1A46254FAE150">operates to true repentance, and brings to experience that conver&s;ion of heart, which is followed by the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and the reception of the Holy Gho&s;t. This he plainly taught in a parallel pa&s;&s;age of the following chapter:<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> <Q>Repent ye therefore, and <HI>be converted,</HI> that your &s;ins may be blotted out, when the times of refre&s;hing &s;hall come from the pre&s;ence of the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e renovating and con&s;olatory effects follow not in con&s;equence of the mini&s;tration of water-bapti&s;m; for if they did, Simon the &s;orcerer, and all the wicked among&s;t men that ever received it, would have had remi&s;&s;ion, and the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>We find the apo&s;tle Paul al&s;o conformed at times in this, and divers other ceremonials; but when he afterwards perceived hurt already had, and was likely &s;till to en&s;ue from &s;uch conformity, he forbore it; and<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> thanked God that he had only baptized <HI>Cri&s;pus, Gaius,</HI> and the hou&s;hold of <HI>Stephanas;</HI> declaring, that Chri&s;t <HI>&s;ent him not to baptize,</HI> (that is, with water) but <HI>to preach the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>Peter him&s;elf al&s;o afterwards, probably ob&s;erving a danger of water-bapti&s;m being received and e&s;pou&s;ed as the real bapti&s;m of the Go&s;pel, guards the believ|ers again&s;t &s;uch a dangerous mi&s;take,<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> by &s;hewing what the true chri&s;tian bapti&s;m is; to wit, that it is not that which puts away the filth of the fle&s;h, but that which produceth the an&s;wer of a good con&s;ci|ence towards God. Thus it is not the figurative, but the effective bapti&s;m pointed to by the figure, the refining bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t that &s;aveth.</P>
<P>It is well known by the experience of many, that this bapti&s;m is gradually effected by &s;piritual immer&s;ions of the &s;oul, according to the mea&s;ure of corruption it hath imbibed, and to the &s;trictne&s;s or
<PB N="18" REF="019924_0017_0FE1A46436C2C898">laxity of its attention to the great Baptizer. A &s;en&s;e of its &s;inful condition, with the di&s;tance it &s;tands at from the God of perfect purity, is fir&s;t given it, whereby it is brought into &s;elf-aba&s;ement, contrition, and, at length, into humble re&s;ignation of all to him. Thus it becomes baptized into the &s;imilitude of the death of Chri&s;t, which is a death unto all that is of a carnal and &s;en&s;ual nature. Through bapti&s;m it al&s;o ri&s;eth with him into newne&s;s of life, which enableth it to bring &s;orth the fruits of the &s;pirit to his prai&s;e.

<P>It is improper to imagine, that the &s;ign of cir|cumci&s;ion, given to Abraham and his de&s;cendants, was a type of water-bapti&s;m, which was only an outward and typical &s;ign it&s;elf. Ceremony and &s;ub&s;tance are type and antitype; not ceremony and ceremony. What the circumci&s;ion of the fore&s;kin pointed to, was the inward circumci&s;ion of the fle&s;hly heart, called for by Mo&s;es, Deut. x. 16. and promi&s;ed, chap. xxx. 6.

<P>Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion at fir&s;t, and tradition afterwards, having inculcated water-bapti&s;m as a permanent in&s;titution of our Lord's, and an indi&s;pen&s;able part of the go&s;pel-mini&s;tration, &s;ome of its advocates have weakly argued for it as &s;uch, from his wa&s;hing<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">John xiii.</NOTE> the feet of his di&s;ciples, and directing it as their duty to do the like to each other.

<P>Water-bapti&s;m being an e&s;&s;ential part of John's commi&s;&s;ion, he properly admitted his di&s;ciples by it; which the great Admini&s;trator of &s;piritual bapti&s;m <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> not.

On the contrary, tho&s;e who obey not the internal manife&s;tations of his &s;pirit, are none of his, whoever baptizeth them with water.

<P>The words of our Saviour,<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mark x. 13.</NOTE> <Q>Suffer the little children to come unto me,</Q> afford no ground for infant-bapti&s;m.

<P>The command, <Q>Go teach all nations, baptiz|ing,</Q> &amp;c. &s;hews that the bapti&s;m therein meant, &s;hould be as general as the preaching there intended, both among Jews and Gentiles; which water|bapti&s;m evidently was not. For Paul, who was &s;ent chiefly to the Gentiles, was very &s;paring in the u&s;e of it, and thanked God that he had baptized but two or three families with it, declaring that <HI>was not his commi&s;&s;ion;</HI> yet he planted many churches, which contained numbers who received the &s;pirit, and walked in the faith and fellow&s;hip of the go&s;pel, and who were <HI>as real Chri&s;tians</HI> without water-bapti&s;m, as others were with it. This &s;hews, that it was neither made an e&s;&s;ential, nor an integral part of Chri&s;tianity; and con&s;equently, that the conti|nuance of it was but an occa&s;ional conde&s;cen&s;ion; for it having been an ancient cu&s;tom both among Jews and Gentiles, to initiate their pro&s;elytes by it, and al&s;o admini&s;tered by John under divine authority, and taken up from him by the di&s;ciples of our Lord, it was become a ceremony of con&s;iderable account with the generality, who &s;aw not &s;ufficiently into the purity and &s;implicity of the Go&s;pel: therefore it could not, even after the bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t by the Holy Gho&s;t appeared, be every where laid a&s;ide &s;uddenly; neither was it required &s;o to be, but, as John intimated, to <HI>decrea&s;e,</HI> or fall into di&s;u&s;e by degrees.

<P>We read, Eph. v. 25, 26. <Q>Chri&s;t al&s;o loved the Church, and gave him&s;elf for it, that <HI>he</HI> might &s;anctify and clean&s;e it with the wa&s;hing of water by the word; that he might pre&s;ent it to him&s;elf <HI>a glorious church, not having &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing;</HI> but that it &s;hould be <HI>holy and without blemi&s;h.</HI></Q> This is the work of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, and therefore is done by his own &s;piritual bapti&s;m. <HI>The water of the word</HI> &s;ignifies its clean&s;ing power, as<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">1 Peter ii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>the milk of the word</HI> denotes its nutri|mental virtue; and this &s;anctifying <HI>word</HI> is the i&s;&s;uing forth of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t for great and gracious purpo&s;es, who is him&s;elf the emphatical and all powerful <HI>Word,</HI> through whom the Father effects his will, and communicates all things to his people. By him alone the church can be rendered <HI>holy, and pre&s;ented without blemi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>According to apo&s;tolic doctrine, there is but <HI>one bapti&s;m</HI> now remaining in force:<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 5.</NOTE> <Q>One Lord, one faith, one bapti&s;m.</Q> And as the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation is that of Chri&s;t, the one bapti&s;m mu&s;t be the bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t; which is not by water, but the Holy Gho&s;t:<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 13.</NOTE> "For," &s;aith Paul, <Q>by one &s;pirit are we all baptized into one body.</Q> By receiving the &s;ame &s;pirit, we become of the &s;ame &s;piritual body. The outward and vi&s;ible &s;ign may introduce us into member&s;hip with &s;uch an outward
<PB N="25" REF="019924_0024_0FE1A47CC426B2C8">and vi&s;ible church as holds with the retention of the &s;ign; but it is the effectual operation of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t in us, that renders us members of his body, or true &s;piritual church.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction betwixt our Saviour's bapti&s;m, and that of John, lies not in the &s;ame elementary mini&s;tration after a different mode, or under another form of words.<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> <Q>I, (&s;aith John) indeed have baptized you with water; but he &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> This plainly &s;hews, that the bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t, and that of John, were two &s;eparate bapti&s;ms, and that they are perfectly di&s;tinct, and different from each other, as type and antitype.</P>
<P>Some have argued, that <HI>as the &s;oul is not properly a man without the body, nor the body without the &s;oul, but both in conjunction make the man; &s;o water-bapti&s;m and &s;pirit-bapti&s;m are both requi&s;ite to make up the one Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m.</HI> But though &s;oul and body be the two con&s;tituent parts of a man, the two bapti&s;ms have no &s;uch con&s;titutional connection. That of the &s;pirit, being the effective reality, is complete in it&s;elf; but that of water was only a temporary figure, and no more a part of the bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t, than the circumci&s;ion of the fore&s;kin was a part of the circumci&s;ion of the heart.</P>
<P>The tran&s;action of Philip with the Ethiopian eunuch, Acts viii. hath been treated as if meant to give a miraculous &s;anction to water-bapti&s;m. But it is evident, this great and well-di&s;po&s;ed man had been at, Jeru&s;alem with a pious intention to wor&s;hip the true God, who knowing the &s;incerity of his heart, &s;ent Philip to in&s;truct him, and to preach his Son Je&s;us to him, as the Saviour of mankind. After he had &s;o done, as they pa&s;&s;ed near a certain
<PB N="26" REF="019924_0025_0FE1A47E9C4438A8">water, the eunuch judging, according to the cu&s;tom of both Jews and Gentiles, that he mu&s;t be entered as a pro&s;elyte by the u&s;ual ceremony, made a motion to Philip that he might be there baptized. And, as the apo&s;tles, in this early time of the go&s;pel, &s;aw fit occa&s;ionally to conde&s;cend to this and various other rituals, Philip went into the water with him, and baptized him. But, if any miracle was wrought, the text affords no te&s;timony that it was done to give a &s;anction to water-bapti&s;m, nor that it is a perpetual in&s;titution of our Lord. It doth not appear in the New Te&s;tament, that he ever in&s;ti|tuted, adopted, or once admini&s;tered water-bapti&s;m him&s;elf. The evangeli&s;t declares, that<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">John iv. 2.</NOTE> <Q>Je&s;us him&s;elf baptized not:</Q> that is, not with water; and undoubtedly for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e <HI>it was not his bapti&s;m,</HI> but John's, who was the only per&s;on we find divinely commi&s;&s;ioned for it. Our Lord's &s;ubmitting him&s;elf to it, under John's mini&s;tration, was upon the &s;ame footing that he &s;ubmitted to the Jewi&s;h ceremonials. They had all been divinely commanded, and in acknowledgment of them as &s;uch, he countenanced the practice of them, till the period of their obligation &s;hould arrive, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his own &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>No one outwardly-connected body upon earth, hath a right to engro&s;s to it&s;elf the title of <HI>the true church,</HI> and thence to a&s;&s;ert, there is no &s;alvation but within its own peculiar pale; for all profe&s;&s;ing churches are compo&s;ed, more or le&s;s, of a promi&s;|cuous number of tho&s;e who love and fear God, and of tho&s;e who regard him not with that reverence and &s;ubjection all ought to do.

<P>Undoubtedly, the &s;ign hath been piou&s;ly u&s;ed by many, and &s;till may be &s;o by tho&s;e to whom the termination of it doth not yet appear; but &s;eeing it is not in it&s;elf of the &s;piritual nature of the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, the nece&s;&s;ary que&s;tion now is, <HI>Whether our Lord in&s;tituted it with a declared intention, that the ob&s;ervance of it &s;hould be an univer&s;al e&s;tabli&s;hment throughout the Chri&s;tian churches to the end of time?</HI> If this be not a&s;certained in the affirmative, it cannot, with propriety, be in&s;i&s;ted on as an ordinance obli|gatory upon us at this day.

<P>Our Saviour and his di&s;ciples being engaged in the celebration of the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over, the &s;ame night he was betrayed, we read,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxvi. 26-30.</NOTE> <Q>As they were eating, Je&s;us took bread, and ble&s;&s;ed it, and brake it, and gave it to his di&s;ciples, and &s;aid, Take, eat; this is my body.

Adding, For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do &s;hew the Lord's death till he come.</Q></P>
<P>There is nothing in the&s;e texts that enjoins the perpetuity of the &s;ymbols. The words, <HI>till he come,</HI> &s;hews the ob&s;ervance of them to be no longer of obligation than <HI>till his &s;econd coming.</HI> We do not read, You &s;hall thus participate of the &s;igns through all future generations; nor have we any &s;pecific direction <HI>how often</HI> they &s;hould be u&s;ed in the interval, which indicates a liberty in that re&s;pect; but no authority for their exten&s;ion beyond the time of the Lord's coming. When they were received, it was to be <HI>in remembrance of him,</HI> which mu&s;t be during <HI>his ab&s;ence</HI> from them; for when pre&s;ent, he mu&s;t be an object of <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> not of <HI>remembrance;</HI> therefore the time intended for the reception of tho&s;e tokens

He al&s;o &s;hewed, that his &s;piritual advent, and indwelling, was not to be confined to his pre&s;ent di&s;ciples; but &s;hould al&s;o be manife&s;ted to all that love him, and keep his commandments.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">John v. 23.</NOTE> <Q>If any man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and <HI>we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</HI></Q></P>

<P>The outward and vi&s;ible &s;ign appears to have been recommended by our Lord, only for the interval between his per&s;onal departure and his &s;piritual return, the u&s;e of it being to commemorate his death till he came; con&s;equently, when he was come, the ob&s;ervance of it was no longer obligatory, but occa&s;ionally permitted, like the wa&s;hing of one another's feet, or the anointing of the &s;ick with oil, till they &s;hould gradually drop away, as the reality wherein they terminated &s;hould advance in the hearts of the believers. But the progre&s;s of the&s;e in &s;pirituality being early ob&s;tructed, by the di&s;incli|nation of many towards the cro&s;s; their love to truth, and zeal for it waxed cold, and a di&s;po&s;ition prevailed to re&s;t in &s;ymbolical religion, which they could ea&s;ily practi&s;e, without parting with their inward corruptions, and walking in that &s;elf-denial the go&s;pel requires.

<P>If this kingdom cometh not with outward ob&s;er|vation, it is in vain to &s;eek it by outward ob&s;ervations, and to pretend to &s;upport it by them.

<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding this apo&s;tolic hi&s;torian hath omitted the ceremonial, he hath given a large account of our Lord's di&s;cour&s;e concerning the &s;ub&s;tance, in chap. 6. wherein, among&s;t many other &s;imilar expre&s;&s;ions, he &s;aith,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">John vi. 32, 51, 54.</NOTE> <Q>My Father giveth you the <HI>true bread</HI> from heaven&mdash;I am the <HI>living bread</HI>

<P>Knowing in him&s;elf, that by apprehending his metaphorical expre&s;&s;ions in a literal &s;en&s;e, many of his di&s;ciples, as well as the Jews, took offence, he, for explanation, directly told them, ver&s;e 63. <Q>It is the &s;pirit that quickeneth; the fle&s;h profiteth nothing.</Q> From whence it appears, that could we eat the very fle&s;h, and drink the blood of the outward body of Chri&s;t, <HI>it would not profit us.</HI> How vain and u&s;ele&s;s therefore, as well as contrary to &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, is the Romi&s;h notion, that the bread con&s;ecrated by a prie&s;t, is tran&s;ub&s;tantiated into that body of fle&s;h and blood, which, if actually received, <HI>would profit nothing</HI> to the &s;oul!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. ON WAITING UPON GOD, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Paul &s;hewed, that<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tim. ii. 5.</NOTE> <Q>there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us;<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 18.</NOTE> through whom we have acce&s;s <HI>by one &s;pirit</HI> unto the Father,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. i. 6.</NOTE> and <HI>in whom alone</HI> we are accepted.</Q> We have no power to draw near unto God but by him.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 6.</NOTE> <Q>I am the way," &s;aid he, "and the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me.</Q> In order to wor&s;hip aright, therefore, we mu&s;t fir&s;t wait for him, that we may feel the power of his &s;pirit in our hearts, to illuminate, quicken, and enable us, inwardly to approach the throne of divine grace, in faith and re&s;ignation; that our offerings may come up with acceptance on his holy altar.</P>
<P>The communication of his &s;pirit being of his own free grace, it is not in the power of man to obtain it when he plea&s;eth; therefore, it mu&s;t be waited for. Activity, in exterior ordinances, is an employment very different from true waiting; which
<PB N="42" REF="019924_0041_0FE1A68FDE2C0790">con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;olemn and &s;teady inward retirement of &s;oul to him, in humility, faith, and patience, that he may conde&s;cend to renew its &s;trength in him, and enable it to wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth, according to his will.</P>
<P>In this practice, the people of God, in all gene|rations, &s;en&s;ibly experienced the times of refre&s;hing from his pre&s;ence, and ability to with&s;tand tempta|tion, to hold on their way amid&s;t the various a&s;&s;aults of the powers of evil, and occa&s;ionally to &s;tand firm in &s;uffering for his glorious cau&s;e. Hence we find them, in holy writ, frequent in expre&s;&s;ing the benefit of waiting upon God, and earne&s;t in their exhorta|tions to it. Let us attend to a few in&s;tances.</P>
<P>P&s;alm xxvii. 14. <Q>Wait on the Lord. Be of good courage, and he &s;hall &s;trengthen thine heart. Wait, I &s;ay, on the Lord.</Q> This contains encouragement, and repeated exhortation to waiting.</P>
<P>Ho&s;ea xii. 6. <Q>Turn thou to thy God; keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</Q> This intimates the nece&s;&s;ity of per&s;everance in waiting, as well as in the practice of uprightne&s;s and charity.</P>
<P>P&s;alm xxxiii. 20. <Q>Our &s;oul <HI>waiteth for</HI> the Lord; he is our help, and our &s;hield.</Q> This &s;hews, their waiting upon him was in expectation of his divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I&s;a. xl. 31. <Q>They that wait upon the Lord &s;hall renew their &s;trength. They &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> up with wings as eagles; they &s;hall run, and not be weary; they &s;hall walk, and not faint.</Q> Herein are held forth gracious a&s;&s;urances of quickening &s;trength in the practice of waiting.</P>
<P>Micah vii. 7. <Q>I will look unto the Lord; I will <HI>wait for</HI> the God of my &s;alvation. My God will hear me.</Q> This indicates the holy re&s;olution of the prophet, and his confidence in waiting.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="019924_0042_0FE1A6958D2F9470">
Habak. ii. 1. <Q>I will &s;tand upon my watch, and &s;et me upon the tower, and will watch to &s;ee what he will &s;ay unto me, or <HI>in me,</HI> and what I &s;hall an&s;wer when I am reproved.</Q> Watching here is &s;ynonymous with waiting, and this pa&s;&s;age denotes the dependance of the prophet, in this inward and mental exerci&s;e, to have been upon the Lord for in&s;truction.</P>
<P>P&s;al. xl. 1, 2. <Q>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. He brought me up al&s;o out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and &s;et my feet upon a rock, and e&s;tabli&s;hed my goings.</Q> This evinces the propriety of a continuance in waiting, and the happy &s;ucce&s;s attending it.</P>
<P>That this waiting was not only the practice of particulars, but al&s;o of the congregated bodies of God's people, appears from that reprehen&s;ion of the &s;pirit of prophecy in Ezekiel, again&s;t the in&s;incere among&s;t the I&s;raelites:<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiii. 31.</NOTE> <Q>They come unto thee <HI>as the people cometh,</HI> and <HI>they &s;it before thee as my people,</HI> and they hear thy words; but they will not do them.</Q></P>
<P>We al&s;o find, that whil&s;t the elders of Judah &s;ate before the prophet, he was led through &s;uch a variety of divine vi&s;ions concerning the &s;tate of that people, as take up from chap. viii. 1. to chap. xi. 4. to relate. During the time he was thus inwardly engaged, the elders undoubtedly <HI>&s;ate in &s;ilence,</HI> as well as him&s;elf; for in conclu&s;ion, he &s;aith, <Q>The &s;pirit of the Lord fell upon me, and &s;aid unto me, Speak,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>P&s;alm xxxvii. 7. and lxii. 1. &s;hew the waiting of the Lord's &s;ervants began, and continued for &s;ome time <HI>in &s;ilence;</HI> for, according to the Hebrew, the&s;e texts are, <Q><HI>Be &s;ilent to the Lord,</HI> and wait patiently

<P>Lam. iii. 25, 28. <Q>The Lord is good unto them that <HI>wait for him,</HI> to the &s;oul that &s;eeketh him. It is good that a man &s;hould both hope, and <HI>quietly wait</HI> for the &s;alvation of the Lord. It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. He &s;itteth alone, and <HI>keepeth &s;ilence,</HI> becau&s;e he hath borne it upon him.</Q> Here is great encouragement to the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;ilent waiter.</P>
<P>The evangelical prophet is &s;till more expre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>I&s;a. lxiv. 4. <Q>Since the beginning of the world, men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye &s;een, O God, be&s;ides thee, what he hath prepared for him that <HI>waiteth</HI> for him.</Q> This evidenceth, there is &s;omething more excellent than is po&s;&s;ible to the conceived by the natural, or unregenerate, man, to be enjoyed in devout and patient waiting. Hence ari&s;eth the fervency of zeal for thus waiting, and the great earne&s;tne&s;s therein of tho&s;e who experienced the benefit of it; which we find emphatically expre&s;&s;ed in the following texts.</P>
<P>P&s;alm cxxx. 6. <Q>My &s;oul waiteth for the Lord <HI>more</HI> than they that watch for the morning: I &s;ay, <HI>more</HI> than they that watch for the morning.</Q></P>
<P>I&s;a. xxvi. 9. <Q>With my &s;oul have I de&s;ired thee in the night; yea, with my &s;pirit within me will I &s;eek thee early.</Q></P>
<P>P&s;alm xlii. 1, 2. <Q>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, &s;o panteth my &s;oul after thee, O God! My &s;oul <HI>thir&s;teth</HI> for God, for the living God. When &s;hall I come and appear before God?</Q></P>
<P>As the &s;piritually-minded, under pa&s;t di&s;pen&s;a|tions, were &s;en&s;ible of their inability properly to

<PB N="46" REF="019924_0045_0FE1A69AF93802A0">of his inward and &s;piritual appearance; which the apo&s;tle gives comfortable a&s;&s;urance of, Heb. ix. 28. <Q>Chri&s;t was once offered to bear the &s;ins of many, and <HI>unto them that look for him &s;hall he appear the &s;econd time, without &s;in unto &s;alvation.</HI></Q> By this we under&s;tand, that as he once appeared after an outward and corporeal manner, and gave up the body prepared for him, as an expiation for the &s;ins of all who &s;hould come to repentance; &s;o to tho&s;e who &s;hould <HI>look internally for him</HI> in faith, he &s;hall <HI>again appear</HI> by the revelation of his &s;pirit in their hearts, to effect the work of regeneration in them, in order to their eternal &s;alvation. For, this <HI>&s;econd appearance</HI> of Chri&s;t to tho&s;e who <HI>piou&s;ly look,</HI> and <HI>patiently wait,</HI> for him, cannot intend his <HI>la&s;t advent;</HI> for then he &s;hall al&s;o appear to tho&s;e that <HI>look not for him</HI> with de&s;ire, to their final condemnation.</P>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid, it may &s;ufficiently appear, that waiting upon God in &s;ilence, faith, and patience, is not a modern peculiarity originated among the people called Quakers, nor the fruit of a de&s;picable enthu&s;ia&s;m; but a nece&s;&s;ary practice of ancient date and long continuance among&s;t the Lord's people, as preparatory and requi&s;ite to the reception of divine ability to<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 15.</NOTE> <HI>pray with the &s;pirit, and with a right under&s;tanding al&s;o.</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iv. 7.</NOTE> "Watch unto prayer," &s;aid Peter.

<P>Having experimentally received an inward &s;en&s;e of the divine goodne&s;s in thus waiting, the living among&s;t the people above-mentioned are engaged to &s;it down in a watchful &s;tillne&s;s, both in their public meetings and private retirements, before Him who made heaven and earth, the &s;eas, and the fountains

Let none, therefore, by rejecting and deriding what they have not experienced, lo&s;e the precious opportunity now afforded them; but addre&s;s them&s;elves earne&s;tly to<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. lv. 6.</NOTE> <HI>&s;eek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near,</HI> that happily in<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 27</NOTE> <HI>feeling after him they may find him, who is not far from every one of us.</HI></P>
<P>If we &s;uffer the low concerns of this mutable world, its earthly profits, or deceitful plea&s;ures, its friend&s;hips, fa&s;hions, or any other of its corruptions, to attach our minds, and divert them from attending to the motions of the &s;pirit of God in our hearts, till we fill up &s;uch a mea&s;ure of iniquity as &s;hall occa&s;ion him to for&s;ake us, we may &s;eek him after|wards, as E&s;au did the ble&s;&s;ing, in vain. For, he &s;aith,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Gen. vi. 3.</NOTE> <Q>My &s;pirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man.</Q> Time &s;ufficient for repentance is afforded to all, and the will of God is our &s;anctification. Why then, &s;ome may query, are we not &s;anctified? Is Satan too &s;trong for Almighty power? By no means. Such que&s;tions are &s;tarted from improper grounds. As the Lord, in wi&s;dom, hath made man a rea&s;onable creature, he deals with him according to rea&s;on, and not by ab&s;olute force. He &s;hews him good and evil, with their oppo&s;ite con&s;equences, per&s;uades, intreats, and pre&s;&s;eth him to refu&s;e the evil, and choo&s;e the good, that he may reap the fruit of it; even eternal life. If the will of man be &s;o perver&s;e, as to prefer a continuance in the gratifications of &s;in, he &s;ows to the fle&s;h, and of the fle&s;h mu&s;t reap corruption. If he wilfully reject

Knowing this, the good apo&s;tle thus earne&s;tly addre&s;&s;ed the believers:<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vi. 1.</NOTE> <Q>We then as workers together with Him, be&s;eech you al&s;o, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</Q> For, though the grace of God that brings &s;alvation hath appeared to all men, its appearance is rendered in vain to &s;uch as by their di&s;obedience to it, and rejection of it, fru&s;trate the accompli&s;hment of its gracious end and purpo&s;e towards them.</P>
<P>It is a weak argument, that we have now a complete canon of the &s;criptures, and therefore have le&s;s need of the &s;pirit than the primitives; as if the letter could &s;upply the place, and do the work of the &s;pirit.

The holy &s;criptures, which &s;o &s;trongly recommend us to be led by the &s;pirit, to live in the &s;pirit, and to walk in the &s;pirit, could not be intended to &s;uper&s;ede and &s;et a&s;ide the &s;pirit, and to render its internal operation unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>

We may gather up theoretic notions concerning them from the declarations of tho&s;e who did receive them; but this will not convey the realities they expre&s;s to us. It will center far &s;hort of creating us anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, without which we may profe&s;s our&s;elves Chri&s;tians; but<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 24.</NOTE> <Q>they that are Chri&s;t's, have crucified the fle&s;h, with the affections and lu&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P>But &s;ome, who allow that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit is &s;till afforded to mankind, deny that any man now hath an internal &s;en&s;e of it, &s;o as to di&s;tingui&s;h its motions in them from tho&s;e of their own minds. But, certainly, whoever feels any inward convictions for &s;in conceived or committed, not under the cognizance of law, nor open to other mens knowledge, may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h the motions of the reproved which leads into &s;in, from tho&s;e of the reprover who &s;mites for it, to lead out of it; and if any ever become in&s;en&s;ible of it, it is for want of obeying it. Such as continue to reject it, may occa&s;ion it to become &s;ilent in them for a &s;ea&s;on; but it always remains pre&s;ent with them, though they feel it not, and will revive upon them with inexpre&s;&s;ible terror, at a time when they &s;hall find no way to e&s;cape.</P>

The life and &s;en&s;e of the fir&s;t birth are carnal; the life and &s;en&s;e of the &s;econd are &s;piritual, which nothing but the &s;pirit can communicate.</P>
<P>Peter told the regenerate formerly,<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">I Pet. i. 22.</NOTE> <Q>Ye have purified your &s;ouls in obeying the truth through the &s;pirit.</Q> They had joined the truth, that is, the &s;pirit of truth, in its operation to the purification of their &s;ouls, and certainly, not without a &s;en&s;e of it. This &s;pirit of truth is the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, which he promi&s;ed &s;hould come to<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 8, 13</NOTE> <HI>reprove, or convince, the world of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment, and to guide into all truth.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we &s;ee, the &s;pirit cometh not only to rebuke, convince, and di&s;quiet mankind in evil to lead them out of it, but al&s;o to accompany them in faithful|ne&s;s, and guide them into all truth. For when they are brought to receive it, believe in it, and cleave to it, they become the &s;heep of Chri&s;t; they<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">John x. 3, 4, 14, 27.</NOTE> <HI>hear and follow him,</HI> for <HI>they know his voice;</HI> that is, they are enabled to di&s;tingui&s;h the motions of his &s;pirit from tho&s;e of <HI>the &s;tranger, which they will not follow, but flee from.</HI></P>

There can be no mani|fe&s;tation to any but tho&s;e who receive a &s;en&s;e of it; for that cannot be manife&s;ted to me, which I have no di&s;tinct perception of. In&s;en&s;ible manife&s;tation is a &s;elf-contradiction.</P>
<P>Eph. ii. 1. <Q>You hath he quickened, who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins</Q> Who hath not been, more or le&s;s, in the death of tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins? And who ever experienced a re&s;urrection from this death, unto life in Chri&s;t, by the quickening power of his &s;pirit, without a living &s;en&s;e of it? In&s;en&s;ibi|lity is not a property of life, but of death; therefore the living members of the body or church of Chri&s;t, cannot be in&s;en&s;ible of the life of Chri&s;t, by which their &s;ouls are quickened, or made alive in him.</P>
<P>The mini&s;tration of the &s;pirit hath ever been the life of true religion. The faire&s;t form, and mo&s;t plau&s;ible profe&s;&s;ion, are no more than a lifele&s;s letter without it.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 6.</NOTE> <Q>The letter killeth, but the &s;pirit giveth life;</Q> and who&s;oever receiveth the &s;pirit, receiveth life, and tho&s;e who receive life, receive a &s;en&s;e of that life; for life is not without &s;en&s;e in proportion to its degree, and the higher degree of life any receive, the more &s;en&s;ible they are of its quickening virtue.</P>
<P>The expre&s;s terms of the new covenant, cited from the prophet, Heb. viii. 10, 11, are, <Q>This is the convenant that I will make with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael after tho&s;e days, &s;aith the Lord; I will put my laws
<PB N="52" REF="019924_0051_0FE1A6B2270EB010">into their mind, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they &s;hall be to me a people.

<P>This plainly &s;hews, that under the go&s;pel-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, <HI>the Lord him&s;elf is the teacher of his people, and that individually;</HI> that he openeth his law in their hearts &s;o clearly and indubitably, that none who duly attend to his immediate in&s;tructions, in their con&s;ciences, need to remain under a nece&s;&s;ity of being taught their duty to him by their brethren, or their neighbours.</P>
<P>From the gracious illumination of this Divine Teacher, ari&s;eth the &s;tronge&s;t internal evidence of the truth of Chri&s;tianity to tho&s;e who become &s;ubject to his in&s;truction. Many, under various denominations, have acknowledged, that the truth and excellence of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation hath been rendered more clear and certain to them by this inward principle, than by all other kinds of evidence what&s;oever; and it is a great proof of the good will of God to man|kind, that he hath laid open to all, whether learned or void of literature, this &s;horte&s;t and &s;ure&s;t way to that evidence, which brings with it the mo&s;t clear and cogent degree of convincement.</P>

<P>SOLOMON &s;aith,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi. 1.</NOTE> "The preparations of the heart in man, and the an&s;wer of the tongue, are from the Lord." If the Lord alone can prepare the heart, &s;tir it up, or incline it towards unfeigned holine&s;s, how can any man approach him acceptably till his heart be prepared by him? And how can he know this preparation, except he wait in &s;ilence to feel it?<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 18.</NOTE> It is by the &s;pirit that believers have acce&s;s to the Father; and are not the impre&s;&s;ions and influ|ences of the &s;pirit to be felt and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the workings of our own carnal minds? If they are, ought not believers to wait patiently in &s;ilent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;oul, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h when the golden &s;ceptre is &s;tretched out, which gives liberty to approach the Sacred Pre&s;ence? And mu&s;t not the preparations of the heart by the &s;pirit make us &s;en&s;ible of our real wants, before we can a&s;k aright; and al&s;o of our mi&s;erable &s;tate, before we can &s;eek that relief which is proper for us? Mu&s;t not the &s;pirit likewi&s;e impart help and con&s;olation to us, before we can rejoice in its &s;alvation, prai&s;e the Lord on the banks of deliverance, and make &s;weet melody in our hearts unto him? Can we bow before him in true reverence and fear, in faith, till the &s;pirit hath
<PB N="4" REF="019924_0054_0FE1A6BD33DCD718">mercifully begot the&s;e &s;en&s;ations in the &s;oul? Mu&s;t not the carnal mind, which is at enmity with God, be &s;ilenced in us before the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions prevail over all? If we pre&s;ume to approach him without the &s;en&s;ible drawings of his &s;pirit, may we not &s;peak unadvi&s;edly with our lips, and offer &s;omewhat like the polluted &s;acrifice of the wicked, which is an abomination to him, and therefore cannot be accept|able from a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t? To &s;uch the apo&s;tle &s;aith,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 13.</NOTE> "It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure." Mu&s;t we not con&s;equently wait in &s;ilence till this will be rai&s;ed in us, and power given us to perform a holy wor&s;hip, and to offer an offering in righteou&s;ne&s;s?</P>
<P>The influences of the &s;pirit are not at our com|mand, circum&s;cribed in our time, or limitted by our wills, and therefore mu&s;t be humbly waited for, &s;eeing we can have no acce&s;s without it; and if that in which all our &s;piritual ability and &s;trength is, be not our own, nor at our command, but mu&s;t be freely di&s;pen&s;ed to us afre&s;h by the great Giver, mu&s;t we not &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively wait in &s;ilence for his qualifying power, by which alone we can move aright? Hence David, deeply &s;en&s;ible of his own inability, &s;aith, P&s;alm lxii. 1. "Truly my &s;oul waiteth upon (or, as in the margin, is &s;ilent before) God; from him cometh my &s;alvation;" and ver&s;e 5. "my &s;oul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him."</P>
<P>Do not the&s;e remarks clearly point out the nece&s;&s;ity of our patiently waiting upon the Lord in &s;ilence, for renewed &s;trength, that by the inward and power|ful operations of his Spirit, he may pluck the feet of our minds out of the mire and clay of corrupt thoughts and carnal inclinations, and al&s;o beget a &s;uitable concern and travail of &s;pirit in us, that from
<PB N="5" REF="019924_0055_0FE1A6BF41D98E78">the ari&s;ing of a true &s;piritual exerci&s;e, the mouth may &s;peak what the panting &s;oul feels when it is athir&s;t for God; or, at lea&s;t, be humbly &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e &s;ighs and groans begotten therein by the Spirit, which cannot be uttered in words? Is not this concern and exerci&s;e wherein the &s;oul is deeply engaged, and the judgment clearly convinced, more acceptable to the all-&s;eeing God, who calls for truth in the inward parts, than a multitude of fine unfelt expre&s;&s;ions dropt from the lips, whil&s;t the heart is wandering without due re&s;traint, far from a &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ence? Nay, will not five words &s;poke from a good under&s;tanding under the influence of the Holy Spirit, have more weight with the Almighty, than five thou&s;and uttered from a lukewarm, in&s;en&s;ible, or carele&s;s mind? Can we &s;uppo&s;e the infinitely wi&s;e Creator of all things is, like &s;hort-&s;ighted man, either to be deceived or plea&s;ed with our much &s;peaking? Our Lord &s;aith, "When ye pray, u&s;e not vain repetitions, as the Heathen do, for they think that they &s;hall be heard for their much &s;peaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye a&s;k him." Mat. vi. 7, 8.</P>
<P>The in&s;pired prophet I&s;aiah, in the la&s;t ver&s;e of the fortieth chapter, &s;aith, "They that wait upon the Lord &s;hall renew their &s;trength." In the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the next chapter immediately &s;ucceeding, he &s;hews what is meant by waiting in the&s;e words, "Keep &s;ilence before me, O i&s;lands! and let the people renew their &s;trength." Certainly this &s;ilence imports the &s;ame thing as waiting in the former ver&s;e, &s;eeing the &s;ame effect is attributed to both; and is not the carnal mind and corrupt imagination here commanded to keep &s;ilence before God, that the &s;oul may properly wait and watch unto prayer?
<PB N="6" REF="019924_0056_0FE1A6C0C5467E90">The prophet adds, "Let them come near, then let them &s;peak." This al&s;o appears to call the immortal &s;oul into deep &s;ilence, that therein it may fir&s;t receive divine help to draw near in &s;pirit to the great Jehovah, and then &s;peak forth its humble petition, under a &s;en&s;e of that holy, &s;olemn, awful reverence, which is due from a dependent creature in its approaches towards its Almighty Creator.</P>

<P>Solomon, under an awful &s;en&s;e of the Divine Greatne&s;s and Maje&s;ty, affords us this nece&s;&s;ary caution, when we pre&s;ent our&s;elves before him:<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;s. v. 2.</NOTE> "Be not ra&s;h with thy mouth." This every one certainly is, who pre&s;umes to &s;peak to the Mo&s;t High before he hath duly con&s;idered in who&s;e pre|&s;ence he is. He adds, "Le not thine heart be ha&s;ty to utter any thing before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth, therefore let thy words be few." This plainly inculcates, how much it behoves us to have a reverent &s;en&s;e of the maje&s;ty and purity of the &s;upreme &s;earcher of hearts, and to be deeply humbled into a feeling of our inability and nothing|ne&s;s, before we addre&s;s him with our lips.</P>
<P>If it is not in man's power duly to prepare his own heart, and yet it is his indi&s;pen&s;able duty deeply and reverently to wor&s;hip the Author of his being in &s;pirit and in truth, how nece&s;&s;ary mu&s;t an awful &s;ilence be, that he may know his &s;oul prepared by the immediate hand of God to approach him acceptably! On the contrary, how incon&s;iderate, ha&s;ty, or pre&s;umptuous is the practice of uttering words to him, which the heart doth not under&s;tand, or of confe&s;&s;ing a &s;tate it never &s;en&s;ibly experienced! Certainly, if we believe the Lord is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity with approbation, we mu&s;t conclude, he is more jealous of his honour than to
<PB N="10" REF="019924_0060_0FE1A6CCE885EE90">accept of &s;uch di&s;&s;imulation. Is not an humble, con&s;cientious, &s;ilent waiting in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to be influenced and led by him, abundantly preferable in his &s;ight? Then how much more the &s;ighs and expre&s;&s;ions that proceed from a real heart-affecting &s;en&s;e of his greatne&s;s and omnipre&s;ence, and of the lowne&s;s and unworthine&s;s of the creature that con&s;i|ders it&s;elf as du&s;t and a&s;hes before him! Doth not &s;uch a weighty &s;en&s;e of our meanne&s;s and inability of our&s;elves to offer any thing plea&s;ing to him, who is an infinite &s;pirit &s;uperlatively glorious, unle&s;s he fir&s;t conde&s;cend graciou&s;ly to help our infirmities, and teach us to pray as we ought, di&s;cover more true regard, and real concern of heart, to offer up a &s;piri|tual &s;acrifice that may be acceptable, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t the great Mediator, who never can intercede with the Father to accept an in&s;incere hypocritical offering, a barely drawing near to him with the tongue, and honouring him with the lips, whil&s;t the heart is in&s;en&s;ible of his fear, and amu&s;ed with other objects? Is it not more &s;afe and rational to wait in &s;ilence upon the Lord, than thus to deceive our &s;ouls with &s;parks of our own kindling, warming vain and fooli&s;h &s;elf with a fire of its own lighting, in&s;tead of placing our expectation upon him, who alone can teach his people rightly to profit, and enable them to pray with the Spirit, and with a right under&s;tanding al&s;o?</P>
<P>There is an e&s;&s;ential difference betwixt praying in reality as the &s;pirit &s;hall teach us, and praying in form as men and books advi&s;e us. Tho&s;e who pray under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, pray with additi|onal fervency, knowing their attention fixed on God alone, their under&s;tandings are opened into a true di&s;cerning of their &s;piritual wants, and their &s;ouls quickened to a lively, humble, &s;incere wor&s;hip; wherein their &s;pirits are refre&s;hed, and gain &s;trength
<PB N="11" REF="019924_0061_0FE1A6CE6ACCC1B0">in the Lord, and in the power of his might. On the other hand, men and books may furni&s;h with fair &s;eemings, and plau&s;ible expre&s;&s;ions, but they cannot effect that brokenne&s;s of &s;pirit, that contri|tion of heart, and &s;en&s;ibility of &s;oul which the Spirit of God gives. They may teach to &s;ay, Lord! Lord! whil&s;t Satan rules in the will and affections, and carries the imaginations after divers vanities; for nothing le&s;s than the power of the &s;pirit can &s;ubdue and chain down the carnal mind. How nece&s;&s;ary then is an humble waiting in &s;ilence, truly to know what &s;pirit we are of, before we offer any thing to the living God? Without this knowledge we mu&s;t be liable to offer &s;trange fire, which the Lord never commanded, like the &s;ons of Aaron, who, through negligence having &s;uffered the holy fire, divinely kindled, to go out, pre&s;ented a &s;trange fire of man's kindling, for which they &s;uffered death. Ought not this expre&s;&s;ive in&s;tance of divine di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the pre&s;umptuous &s;ub&s;titutions of men after their own wills, and in the place of God's appointment, to deter mankind from offering their own carnal conceptions and contrivances, in&s;tead of his inward and &s;piritual requirings? Ought not this con&s;idera|tion to &s;trike every one with a deep and awful &s;en&s;e, that &s;omething more is due to the great Jehovah, than tho&s;e common, carele&s;s, unfelt modes of wor&s;hip which too many are apt to &s;atisfy them&s;elves with; and more e&s;pecially as he hath declared,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Lev. x. 3.</NOTE> "I will be &s;anctified in them that come night me." How can he be &s;anctified in us, but as his own pure Spirit awfully prevails in the &s;oul, puts it forth in humility, and influenceth the will and affections by its holy quickening energy?</P>
<P>If Chri&s;t is indeed our Lord, why are not we more &s;eriou&s;ly concerned to honour him in our
<PB N="12" REF="019924_0062_0FE1A6D408CAAFC8">hearts? If he is our ma&s;ter, why do we not &s;o fear his di&s;plea&s;ure, as to endeavour, with all diligence, to walk circum&s;pectly, not as fools, inattentive to his leadings; but as wi&s;e, &s;eeking to redeem the time, becau&s;e the days are evil?</P>
<P>The Spirit, by the mouth of Zechariah, &s;aith,<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Zech. ii. 13.</NOTE> "Be &s;ilent, O all fle&s;h! before the Lord; for he is rai&s;ed up out of his holy habitation." Is not a mode&s;t humble &s;ilence properly due to the pre&s;ence of the King of kings, and Lord of lords? Doth it not be&s;peak more real and awful regard to his perfect holine&s;s, wi&s;dom and power, to wait for his Spirit to open our hearts and lips, before we attempt vocally to &s;peak forth his prai&s;e, than to be ha&s;ty in uttering words without true knowledge before our all-&s;eeing Judge? Then how approveable is the practice of &s;olemn &s;ilent waiting, till we receive illumination and ability properly to wor&s;hip the Almighty! Would the potentates of the earth think them&s;elves treated with becoming reverence, &s;hould their &s;ubjects and &s;ervants immediately approach them with a multitude of words, and continue them the whole time they &s;tand in their pre&s;ence, in&s;tead of waiting &s;ilently to hear their plea&s;ure, and receive their commands? How much le&s;s ought we to expect &s;uch behaviour is plea&s;ing, or acceptable from us, to him who &s;earches all hearts, and knows us better than we know our&s;elves; to whom we mu&s;t be indebted for the true knowledge of every &s;piritual want, before we can have wi&s;dom to a&s;k aright according to his will!</P>

<PB N="13" REF="019924_0063_0FE1A6D844BF64A0">ju&s;t abhorrence of &s;elf filled his humbled mind, when he was favoured with this awful &s;ight of the &s;upreme glory! How &s;elf-aba&s;ing were his &s;en&s;ations, and emphatical his expre&s;&s;ions, when he cried, "Woe is me! for I am undone, becau&s;e I am a man of unclean lips! and I dwell in the mid&s;t of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have &s;een the King, the Lord of Ho&s;ts!" How different is this heart-felt acknowledgment, proceeding from the powerful convictions of the Holy Spirit, to tho&s;e dry, formal, unfelt words that come from the lips of bare nominal Chri&s;tians! Notwith&s;tanding every di&s;ciple hath not &s;o large a portion of the Holy Spirit, as this great prophet had, yet every one is graciou&s;ly favoured with a mea&s;ure &s;ufficient to render his offering &s;piritual and living.</P>
<P>We read, that after the a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, his di&s;ciples<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 1, 4.</NOTE> "were all with one accord in one place, when they were filled with the Holy Gho&s;t." Tho' the text doth not expre&s;&s;ly &s;ay, they were waiting in &s;ilence for the promi&s;e of the Father, yet it appears as probable they were, as that they were not; for there is no mention of any vocal exerci&s;e among&s;t them at that time, before they were influenced thereunto by that peculiar communication and impul&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t, whence "they began to &s;peak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance." The attention is certainly more likely to be fixed upon, and &s;tayed in true watchfulne&s;s towards the Lord, and the mind more fitly prepared to receive the influence of his divine light and power, in &s;ilent waiting, than if agitated in a continual practice of running over a multitude of unfelt expre&s;&s;ions.</P>

Is not the carnal mind of man included in this prohibition? What is more likely to &s;catter and divert his attention from the right object, than thoughts, imaginations, and propen&s;ities of an earthly or &s;en&s;ual nature? What more di&s;honourable to the Lord of perfection and purity, than the bu&s;y forward actings of an unprepared and corrupt heart in &s;piritual things? What is more nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;ilenced than that which is at enmity with God? What more becoming an humble dependent crea|ture, &s;en&s;ible of the depravity of its nature, of its inability to do any good, and of the honour due to the pre&s;ence of its Creator, than a deeply expre&s;&s;ive &s;olemn &s;ilence before him?</P>
<P>Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t taught his di&s;ciples to avoid the practice of hypocrites,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Mat. vi. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> "Who love to pray &s;tanding in the &s;ynagogues, and in the corners of the &s;treets, that they may be &s;een of men." He al&s;o directed, "When ye pray, u&s;e not vain repeti|tions, as the Heathen do, for they think that they &s;hall be heard for their much &s;peaking;" and indeed, what now makes a greater &s;hew or figure in religion among&s;t many, than to u&s;e long and frequent prayers, and much formal devotion, as if their eye was more towards the prai&s;e of men than acceptance with God, and as if they gloried in empty appear|ances? But what is the precept of Chri&s;t?<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Ibid vi. 6.</NOTE> "When thou praye&s;t, enter into thy clo&s;et, and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in &s;ecret, and thy Father, who &s;eeth in &s;ecret, &s;hall reward thee openly." Doth not this teach us, that before we approach the Fountain of all wi&s;dom, to &s;hut out every thing that would amu&s;e or divert the attention from the reverence due to the great object
<PB N="15" REF="019924_0065_0FE1A33999284EC0">of our adoration, the giver of every good and perfect gift? Can we be too &s;olid, or feel our hearts, affections, and de&s;ires, too much gathered out of tran&s;itory things, into a humbling &s;en&s;e of the Divine Pre&s;ence, when we apply our&s;elves to the &s;olemn act of wor&s;hipping the Maje&s;ty on high?</P>
<P>Since waiting upon God in &s;ilence for renewed &s;trength and &s;piritual wi&s;dom, to lead our hearts, and direct our tongues in vocal prayer, or preaching, makes no o&s;tentatious &s;hew, but rather appears contemptible to the bu&s;y di&s;po&s;ition and wi&s;dom of vain man, it is not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that this &s;elf-denying practice &s;hould gain the approbation or prai&s;e of men; yet in mu&s;t evidently tend to prevent that great and offen&s;ive hypocri&s;y, of drawing near to the Lord with the tongue, and wor&s;hipping him with the lips, whil&s;t the heart is far from him. Can there be any frame more fit or proper for the poor &s;oul, wherein to hear the &s;till &s;mall voice of the true internal Shepherd, than that of an attentive and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;ilent waiting?</P>

<P>Our Lord forbids us to u&s;e vain repetitions; and what efficacy can tho&s;e prayers have, which are made in the will, and by the contrivance of man, or that are uttered either from books, invention, or memory, whil&s;t the heart neither feels the thing the mouth

Whil&s;t people remain in&s;en&s;ible of the real condition of their &s;ouls, and of the true &s;elf-aba&s;ing fear of God, do they not &s;eem to think they &s;hall be heard for their much &s;peaking, if they content them&s;elves with the frequent repetition of long lifele&s;s prayers, which they have not &s;o much as weightily con&s;idered before they uttered them? Is this to wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth; the only wor&s;hip in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t in this go&s;pel-day, and therefore the only wor&s;hip acceptable to God, who is a Spirit? Can this &s;piritual wor&s;hip be performed till the &s;oul feels its operation awfully to humble, engage, and impower the mind to this &s;olemn act? What but the Spirit of the Redeemer is able to awaken and &s;tir up the immortal &s;oul, and endue it with wi&s;dom and utterance, &s;uitably to expre&s;s it&s;elf, according to and under a due &s;en&s;e of its wants?</P>
<P>Chri&s;t in Spirit is the way, or leading power, to the Father; no man can come to the Father but by him. What is the rea&s;on why &s;o many, who profe&s;s to be followers of Chri&s;t, complain of wandering thoughts, inattention, much coldne&s;s, deadne&s;s, and in&s;en&s;ibility in prayer, and other duties and devotions? Is it not becau&s;e they are too little dependent on the dictates of the Spirit, and believe not its &s;en&s;ible influence nece&s;&s;ary to every religious act, nor wait for it to clean&s;e the thoughts of their hearts, and abili|tate them to approach the Mo&s;t High and Holy God in truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s? Is it not becau&s;e &s;uch lean too much to their own un&s;ubjected wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, to place their dependence on the Spirit, and to wait for its re&s;training heart-affecting power to lead them into all truth, and therefore are &s;ent empty away, and no more truly refre&s;hed or

Thus they a&s;k and receive not, becau&s;e they a&s;k ami&s;s; not in a right frame, but in a lukewarm and unconcerned &s;tate of mind. The enemy is too &s;trong for &s;uch wor&s;hippers, and carries their thoughts and imaginations after &s;trange objects, while their lips only approach the Almighty. One &s;ecret prayer, or deep &s;igh from the wre&s;tling &s;oul, produced by the Eternal Spirit, is of more real &s;ervice to it, i&s;&s;ues from it with more fervour, prevails more effectually with the Father, and pro|cures it more refre&s;hment than ten thou&s;and vain repetitions; becau&s;e the virtue of the Spirit of the great Interce&s;&s;or being in the&s;e prayers and &s;ighs, they cannot but find acceptance.</P>
<P>Doth not the common complaint of wanderings in time of prayer, from tho&s;e who oppo&s;e &s;ilent waiting for the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit, to &s;peak or pray according to the will of God, prove the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a practice, in order to wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth?

<P>The apo&s;tle Paul &s;aith,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 26.</NOTE> "The &s;pirit al&s;o helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it&s;elf maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered." By this ju&s;t acknowledgment it appears, the exerci&s;e of a mind deeply affected is more than words can expre&s;s, therefore it &s;peaks to God in un|utterable groans: a thing much de&s;pi&s;ed and &s;coffed at by many profe&s;&s;ors in this age. We &s;ee however, the apo&s;tle was not a&s;hamed to own it to be what him&s;elf and his brethren experienced to be true; which &s;hews the &s;en&s;e they had of their own natural inability and blindne&s;s, and al&s;o their firm depen|dence upon the Holy Spirit, without which they knew not what to pray for as they ought; and therefore found a nece&s;&s;ity to wait for its renewals upon them, before they could either pray for them|&s;elves, or preach to others profitably, and with divine acceptance. How can we at this day pre&s;ume to know what to pray for as we ought without the &s;en&s;ible help of the Holy Spirit, if this great apo&s;tle and his brethren did not? Yet, is there not ground for &s;u&s;picion, from the common practice of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians now, that they do not think them&s;elves at a lo&s;s what to pray for acceptably; and therefore pre&s;umptuou&s;ly offer their invented &s;upplications, without due fear and caution, to him who looketh at the heart, and remain in&s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="19" REF="019924_0069_0FE1A6E5A600F930">of feeling the Holy Spirit to di&s;engage them from roving thoughts, and concerns of a temporal nature, and to communicate of that di&s;cerning wi&s;dom and living power which is requi&s;ite to direct their hearts and tongues aright.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding a previous waiting upon God is &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, the apo&s;tle intimates, that the groanings of the Spirit are effectual without vocal &s;ounds; which proves there is an inward addre&s;s deeper than the expre&s;&s;ion of words, which is heard and accepted of God. Let me add, that Je&s;us him|&s;elf applied to the Father in this manner, when<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John xi. 33.38.41.</NOTE> "He groaned in the Spirit twice," and afterwards lift up his eyes, and before he called Lazarus out of the grave, &s;aid, "Father, I thank thee that thou ha&s;t heard me." This &s;hews his fervent groans were accepted, and his reque&s;t granted, without audible expre&s;&s;ions; and doth not the compa&s;&s;ionate Father &s;till regard the groans begotten by the Spirit of his Son in the hearts of his followers? Indeed there is much efficacy in groans that ari&s;e from this living principle.</P>

When do Chri&s;tians more need the&s;e quickenings than in their a&s;&s;emblies for divine wor&s;hip; and how mu&s;t they di&s;tingui&s;h them, except they wait in &s;ilence? Is it an unwar|rantable pre&s;umption, humbly to wait in expectation of the promi&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to enable us &s;en&s;ibly to wor&s;hip freely, livingly, and powerfully, which cannot be, unle&s;s the Spirit of Chri&s;t is our helper?

<P>If the primitive Chri&s;tians were of them&s;elves &s;o in&s;ufficient to think any thing, or to point out to them&s;elves their own line of duty according to the divine will, they certainly could not of them&s;elves pray or preach to others con&s;i&s;tent therewith, and therefore were obliged to wait for the renewals of light and ability from the Holy Spirit wherein their

This inclined them to &s;it willingly at his feet in &s;ilence, and gladly to receive his pouring forth of the wine and oil into their bleeding wounds, till he healed their back&s;lidings, and forgave their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions.

ROBERT BARCLAY, in his Apology for the true Chri&s;tian Divinity, as held forth by the people called Quakers, has wrote &s;o clearly on the &s;ubject in his eleventh propo&s;ition, that a few quotations from this author may &s;erve to illu&s;trate the fore|going rea&s;ons, and confirm the te&s;timonies of many experimental witne&s;&s;es on the &s;ubject, and profitablene&s;s of &s;olemn &s;ilence.</P>
<P>IN his propo&s;ition on wor&s;hip, in &s;ect. 6. he has the&s;e remarks: <Q>We judge it the duty of all to be diligent in the a&s;&s;embling of them&s;elves toge|ther, and when a&s;&s;embled, the great work of one and all ought to be to wait upon God; and returning out of their own thoughts and imagi|nations, to feel the Lord's pre&s;ence, and know a gathering into his name indeed, where he is in the mid&s;t, according to his promi&s;e. And as every one is thus gathered, and &s;o met together inwardly in their &s;pirits, as well as outwardly in their per&s;ons, there the &s;ecret power and virtue of life is known to refre&s;h the &s;oul, and the pure motions and breathings of God's &s;pirit are felt to ari&s;e; from which, as words of declaration, prayers or prai&s;es ari&s;e, the acceptable wor&s;hip is known, which edifies the church, and is well-plea&s;ing to God. And no man here limits the Spirit of God, nor bringeth forth his own conned and gathered &s;tuff; but every one puts that forth which the Lord puts into their hearts: and it is uttered forth not in man's will and wi&s;dom, but in the evidence and demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and of power. Yea, though there be not a word &s;poken, yet is the true &s;piritual wor&s;hip performed, and the body of Chri&s;t edified; yea, it may, and hath often fallen out among us, that divers meetings
<PB N="28" REF="019924_0078_0FE1A7052A2BC6C0">have pa&s;t without one word; and yet our &s;ouls have been greatly edified and refre&s;hed, and our hearts wonderfully overcome with the &s;ecret &s;en&s;e of God's power and &s;pirit, which, without words, hath been mini&s;tered from one ve&s;&s;el to another. This is indeed &s;trange and incredible to the mere natural and carnally-minded man, who will be apt to judge all time lo&s;t where there is not &s;omething &s;poken that is obvious to the outward &s;en&s;es; and therefore I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t a little upon this &s;ubject, as one that can &s;peak from a certain experience, and not by mere hear&s;ay, of this wonderful and glorious di&s;pen&s;ation; which hath &s;o much the more of the wi&s;dom and glory of God in it, as it is contrary to the nature of man's &s;pirit, will, and wi&s;dom.</Q></P>
<P>He al&s;o in &s;ect. 7. on &s;ilent waiting on God, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus: <Q>For many thus principled, meeting together in the pure fear of the Lord, did not apply them&s;elves pre&s;ently to &s;peak, pray, or &s;ing, &amp;c. being afraid to be found acting forwardly in their own wills, but each made it their work to retire inwardly to the mea&s;ure of grace in them&s;elves, not being only &s;ilent as to words, but even ab&s;taining from all their own thoughts, imaginations, and de&s;ires; &s;o watching in a holy dependence upon the Lord, and meet|ing together not only outwardly in one place, but thus inwardly in one Spirit, and in one name of Je&s;us, which is his power and virtue, they come thereby to enjoy and feel the ari&s;ings of this life, which, as it prevails in each particular, becomes as a flood of refre&s;hment, and over&s;preads the whole meeting: for man, and man's part and wi&s;dom, being denied and chained down in every individual, and God exalted, and his grace in dominion in the heart; thus his name comes to
<PB N="29" REF="019924_0079_0FE1A706ADE5EC78">be one in all, and his glory breaks forth, and covers all; and there is &s;uch a holy awe and reverence upon every &s;oul, that if the natural part &s;hould ari&s;e in any, or the wi&s;e part, or what is not one with the life, it would pre&s;ently be chained down and judged out. And when any are, through the breaking forth of this power, con&s;trained to utter a &s;entence of exhortation or prai&s;e, or to breathe to the Lord in prayer, then all are &s;en&s;ible of it;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxvii. 19.</NOTE> for the life in them an&s;wers to it, as in water face an&s;wereth to face.

<P>In &s;ection 15. after having de&s;cribed the true wor&s;hip in &s;pirit e&s;tabli&s;hed by Chri&s;t, and clearly proved the nece&s;&s;ity and advantage of it, he proceeds thus: <Q>He hath al&s;o in&s;tituted an inward and &s;piritual wor&s;hip: &s;o that God now tieth not his people to the temple of Jeru&s;alem, nor yet unto outward ceremonies and ob&s;ervation; but taketh the heart of every Chri&s;tian for a temple to dwell in; and there immediately appeareth, and giveth him directions how to &s;erve him in any outward
<PB N="30" REF="019924_0080_0FE1A70830A50C78">acts. Since, as Chri&s;t argueth, God is a Spirit, he will now be wor&s;hipped in the Spirit, where he reveals him&s;elf, and dwelleth with the contrite in heart. Now, &s;ince it is the heart of man that now is become the temple of God, in which he will be wor&s;hipped, and no more in particular outward temples, &s;ince, as ble&s;&s;ed Stephen &s;aid, out of the prophet, to the profe&s;&s;ing Jews of old, The Mo&s;t High dwelleth not in temples made with hands. As before the glory of the Lord de&s;cended to fill the outward temple, it behoved to be purified and clean&s;ed, and all polluted &s;tuff removed out of it; yea, and the place for the tabernacle was overlaid with gold, the mo&s;t precious and cleane&s;t of metals; &s;o al&s;o before God be wor&s;hipped in the inward temple of the heart, it mu&s;t al&s;o be purged of its own filth, and all its own thoughts and imaginations, that &s;o it may be fit to receive the Spirit of God, and to be actuated by it. And doth not this directly lead us to that inward &s;ilence, of which we have &s;poken, and exactly pointed out? And further, this wor&s;hip mu&s;t be in truth; intimating, that this &s;piritual wor&s;hip, thus actuated, is only and properly a true wor&s;hip,</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>"Franci&s;cus Lambertus," as quoted by Robert Barclay, in &s;ect. 18. &s;peaketh well, tract. 5. of "prophecy, chap. 3. &s;aying, <Q>Where are they now that glory in their inventions, who &s;ay, A fine invention! A fine invention! This they call invention, which them&s;elves have made up; but what have the faithful to do with &s;uch kind of invention? It is not figments, nor yet inventions, that we will have, but things that are &s;olid, invincible, eternal, and heavenly; not which men have invented, but which God hath revealed: for if we believe the &s;criptures, our invention

And afterwards,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not intended by us to adopt the &s;entiment of a liberty to determine or choo&s;e the text; that, as well as the expo&s;ition, ought to be left to the dictates of the Holy Spirit. See the whole &s;ection in R. B's Apology.</NOTE> Beware (&s;aith he) that thou determine not preci&s;ely to &s;peak what before thou ha&s;t meditated, what&s;oever it be; for though it be lawful to determine the text which thou art to expound, yet not at all the interpretation; le&s;t if thou &s;o do&s;t, thou take from the Holy Spirit that which is his, to wit, to direct thy &s;peech, that thou maye&s;t prophe&s;y in the name of the Lord, void of all learning, meditation, and experience, and as if thou had&s;t &s;tudied nothing at all, committing thy heart, thy tongue, and thy&s;elf wholly unto his Spirit, and tru&s;ting no|thing to thy former &s;tudying or meditation; but &s;aying with thy&s;elf, in great confidence of the divine promi&s;e, The Lord will give a word with much power unto tho&s;e that preach the go&s;pel. But, above all things, be careful thou follow not the manner of hypocrites, who have written almo&s;t word for word what they are to &s;ay, as if they were to repeat &s;ome ver&s;es upon a theatre, having learned all their preaching as they do that act tragedies. And afterwards, when they are in the place of prophe&s;ying, pray the Lord to direct their tongue; but in the mean time, &s;hutting up the way of the Holy Spirit, they determine to &s;ay nothing but what they have written. O unhappy kind of prophets, yea, and truly cur&s;ed, which depend not upon God's Spirit, but upon their own writings or meditation! Why praye&s;t thou to the Lord thou fal&s;e prophet, to give thee his Holy Spirit, by which thou maye&s;t &s;peak things profitable, and yet thou repelle&s;t the Spirit? Why preferre&s;t thou thy meditation or &s;tudy to

<P><Q>Sect. 22. That there is a nece&s;&s;ity of this inward retirement of the mind as previous to prayer, that the Spirit may be felt to draw there|unto, appears, for that in mo&s;t of tho&s;e places where prayer is commanded, watching is prefixed thereunto, as nece&s;&s;ary to go before, as Mat. xxiv. 42. Mark xiii. 33. and xiv. 38. Luke xxi. 36. from which it is evident, that this watching was to go before prayer. Now to what end is this watching, or what is it, but a waiting to feel God's Spirit to draw unto prayer, that &s;o it may be done acceptably? For &s;ince we are to "<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 18.</NOTE> pray always in the &s;pirit, and cannot pray of our&s;elves without it, acceptably, this watching mu&s;t be for this end recommended to us, as preceding prayer, that we may watch and wait for the &s;ea&s;onable time to pray, which is when the Spirit moves thereunto.</Q></P>
