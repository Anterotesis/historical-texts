<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is very lamentable and awful to con&s;ider what Numbers of the ri&s;|ing Generation, are <HI>walking in the Ways of their Hearts, and in the Sight of their Eyes, fulfilling the De&s;ires of the Fle&s;h and of the Mind;</HI> regardle&s;s of
<PB N="ii" REF="003153_0003_0FF080EADB66B1B8">
all the &s;olemn Warnings, and Calls they have had, either from the Word or Pro|vidence of GOD. However, we mu&s;t continue calling on, and warning them of their Sin and Danger, <HI>whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</HI></P>
<P>IT is al&s;o comfortable and refre&s;hing to &s;ee, and hear, of &s;uch Numbers of YOUNG PEOPLE renewing their bapti&s;mal Covenant, and devoting them&s;elves to the Fear and Service of GOD; and that there are in many Towns in the Land, Meetings of YOUNG MEN &s;et up, and carried on, upon the <HI>Evenings</HI> of the LORD'S-Days, for religious Exerci&s;es, which if under a good Regulation, may be doubtle&s;s greatly &s;erviceable to the Intere&s;ts of Religion among us.</P>
<P>IT was the &s;etting up &s;uch a Meeting, that occa&s;ion'd the preaching of the fol|lowing Sermons, which come to you, with all po&s;&s;ible <HI>plainne&s;s of Speech;</HI> and O that they might in the <HI>Demon&s;tration of the Spirit and with Power&punc;</HI> And they

&s;hall do &s;o, if while we are <HI>&s;peaking</HI> to the Ear, GOD will <HI>&s;peak</HI> to the Heart.</P>
<P>I hope &s;uch as are &s;erious and con|cern'd to hear what GOD has to &s;peak to them, may here find a Word in Sea|&s;on for them, and that may become, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, profitable to them.</P>
<P>AND as for &s;uch who are going on in their Di&s;obedience and Rebellion, I don't &s;uppo&s;e many &s;uch will be at the Pains of reading them: If they &s;hould, it infinitely concerns them to <HI>&s;ee to it, that they refu&s;e not Him that &s;peaketh,</HI> and therefore to cry for an <HI>hearing Ear, and an under&s;tanding Heart,</HI> that their <HI>Souls may live.</HI></P>
<P>AND if any may be quicken'd and excited by the&s;e plain, &s;erious and &s;o|lemn Calls, and Coun&s;els of GOD to them, to hear his Voice, and be obedi|ent, to engage in the Service of GOD,

<P>SINCE you have been &s;o de&s;irous of my <HI>&s;peak|ing</HI> to you this <HI>Evening,</HI> I have cho&s;e the Words now read unto you, for an Introduc|tion to what I have to &s;peak.

this <HI>Young Man:</HI> And what Cau&s;e &s;hould we have had to admire and adore the Conde&s;cen&s;ions of &s;uch Grace to us, if the Lord had &s;een it be&s;t to &s;end His Me&s;&s;ages to us by <HI>Angels;</HI> but how much more Cau&s;e have we to adore his Mercy and Compa&s;&s;ion to us, in the method he has taken for the Di&s;covery of his Mind and Will to us, even by &s;ending Men of the &s;ame make and frame with our &s;elves, equally con|cern'd with us in the important Things, they <HI>&s;peak</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, and treat with us about.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of CHRIST, are indeed <HI>Angels,</HI> GOD has put this Honour upon His <HI>Emba&s;&s;adors,</HI> and there|fore they are called <HI>Angels,</HI> in the <HI>&s;econd Chapter</HI> of the <HI>Revelation, Unto the Angel of the Church of Ephe|&s;us; Unto the Angel of the Church in Smyrna, Perga|mos</HI> &amp;c. by which the HOLY GHOST means the <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters,</HI> or <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> of tho&s;e Churches. The Me&s;&s;ages of the Lord are &s;ent unto them, to be delivered unto his People, and they are <HI>to give unto every one their Portion in due Sea&s;on.</HI> They are to <HI>feed</HI> the <HI>Lambs</HI> as well as the <HI>Sheep.</HI></P>
<P>I have therefore <HI>(You are my Witne&s;&s;es)</HI> been from one time to another, bringing the Me&s;&s;ages of GOD unto you: I have been often warning, advi&s;ing and exhorting of you, in the <HI>Lord's Name</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, to awaken in you an earne&s;t Sollicitude about the <HI>One thing needful.</HI> And this is what I would in the cour&s;e of my <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> be pur&s;uing with you, and yet more e&s;pecially, when I have &s;uch Opportu|nities for it, as I now have.</P>
<P>I rejoice exceedingly, that GOD has put it into the Hearts of &s;uch a number of you, to meet together on the <HI>Evenings</HI> of his <HI>holy Sabbaths,</HI> for the carrying

on the <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI> of Religion, and that you might be encourag'd and &s;trengthen'd herein, I am now come to <HI>&s;peak</HI> unto you: And I hope you are come hither with &s;erious De&s;ires to hear what GOD the Lord will now <HI>&s;peak.</HI></P>
<P>I look upon my &s;elf, as having received this Di|rection and Order from Him, in who&s;e <HI>Name I &s;peak; Run, Speak to this Young Man.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Doctrine</HI> from which I will &s;peak unto you, &s;hall be this.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT there are many Things to be &s;poken to Young People, which the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, &s;hould be &s;peedy and earne&s;t in the &s;peaking of unto them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>RUN, Speak to this Young Man:</HI> It evidently hints to us, how <HI>&s;peedy</HI> and <HI>earne&s;t</HI> he was to be in deliver|ing the Me&s;&s;ages of the Lord unto him: And &s;o &s;hould the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, the <HI>Angels</HI> of the <HI>Churches</HI> be, in delivering their Me&s;&s;ages from their <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> unto the People, and the Young People e&s;pecially, to whom the Lord &s;ends them, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, before I have done.</P>
<P>WHAT I propo&s;e, under this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> &s;hall be to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>WHAT Things may be proper to be &s;poken to Young People?</HI></P>
<P>AND then,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THAT the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST &s;hould be &s;peedy and earne&s;t in &s;peaking &s;uch Things unto them.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="003153_0006_0FF080F3D0647110">I. I am to &s;hew, <HI>WHAT Things may be proper to be &s;poken to Young People? Run, Speak to this Young Man.</HI> Young Men are then to be &s;poken to, But what are the Things that are to be &s;poken to them?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>BE Thoughtful. U&s;e your &s;elves to &s;erious Con|&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CONSIDERATION</HI> is the fir&s;t &s;tep to <HI>Conver&s;i|on, P&s;alm</HI> 119.59. <HI>I thought on my Ways, and turned my feet unto thy Te&s;timonies.</HI> Some tran&s;late <HI>I thought, I con&s;idered, rea&s;oned on;</HI> truly I con&s;idered, I pon|dered, I diligently weighed: And that it &s;ignifies to reckon, ca&s;t up, to think, and think again upon a thing; from all which its evident that this thinking, is &s;erious pondering and <HI>Con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P>AND this is what I would in the <HI>fir&s;t place,</HI> re|commend unto you.</P>
<P>ASSOON as you are arrived to Years of Di&s;cre|tion and Under&s;tanding, you &s;hould improve the thinking, reflecting Powers GOD has endow'd you with. You &s;hould think much on the <HI>fir&s;t An&s;wer,</HI> you learnt in your <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> viz. That <HI>Man's chief End is to glorify GOD and to enjoy Him for ever.</HI> You mu&s;t then &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, You have a Glorious GOD to &s;erve, a precious Soul to &s;ave, and an Eter|nity to prepare for. You mu&s;t think of what infinite Concernment it is to you, to fear and &s;erve GOD, and &s;ecure the Salvation of your Souls, and that the &s;ooner you &s;et about this great Work, the better. You mu&s;t think for your Encouragement, That if you &s;eek the Lord early, now in your younger Years, you have abundant rea&s;on to hope, and believe, that you &s;hall find Him; becau&s;e He has expre&s;ly told you, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.17. <HI>Tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me.</HI> And 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28.9. <HI>If thou &s;eek Him, He
<PB N="5" REF="003153_0006_0FF080F3D0647110">
will be found of thee.</HI> You &s;hould think of the&s;e En|couragements you have to &s;eek and &s;erve the Lord in the days of your Youth.</P>
<P>You &s;hould <HI>think</HI> how ready and willing GOD now is to &s;hew Mercy to you, to make you the early and happy In&s;tances of His Grace, to pardon, renew, and &s;anctify you, to take an early Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of you for Him&s;elf; to &s;et up His Throne in your Hearts, and rule and reign there, and &s;o give you new Hearts and new Spirits, a Heart to fear Him, and keep all His Commandments, that &s;o it may be well with you.</P>
<P>YOU &s;hould <HI>think,</HI> how that GOD will for this be enquired of, by you, to do it for you, and that it is well worth your &s;eeking for. To excite your ear|ne&s;t &s;eeking, you &s;hould think how &s;ad your Condi|tion will be, if the Lord will not be gracious to you, that if you &s;hould die Strangers to a Work of true and &s;aving Grace, you'l rue it to all Eternity, and it would have been better for you, that you had ne|ver had your Birth and Education in the <HI>Valley</HI> of <HI>Vi&s;ion.</HI> Oh <HI>think</HI> how di&s;tre&s;&s;ing it mu&s;t be hereafter to you, if you &s;hould die in your Sins, to look back and con&s;ider of the many precious Helps and Ad|vantages you had for obtaining Eternal Life. Oh <HI>think</HI> how bitter your Reflections mu&s;t be, to con&s;ider of the many In&s;tructions and Coun&s;els, Admonitions and Warnings, that were given you, by your Parents, Mini&s;ters and godly Friends; and all if po&s;&s;ible to &s;ave you from that Place of Torment; Oh think how grievous it will be to con&s;ider, that when you were &s;o in&s;tructed and warned, yea and entreated to be reconciled to GOD, that the SPIRIT of GOD was often &s;triving with you, exciting you to work out your Salvation, and mind the things of your Peace,
<PB N="6" REF="003153_0007_0FF080F58B1B9120">
before they &s;hould be hid from your Eyes, that you were &s;ometimes almo&s;t per&s;waded to be up and doing, and &s;eeking the Lord while He might be found, and to call upon Him, while He was near, that yet not|with&s;tanding you per&s;i&s;ted in your evil Ways, and would not be reformed, and therefore mu&s;t peri&s;h mi&s;erably and dreadfully: Oh <HI>think</HI> on &s;uch De|&s;truction in Re&s;erve for the Workers of Iniquity, and of the Aggravations thereof, until &s;uch De&s;truction from the Lord is a Terror to you, until you have &s;uch fearful Apprehen&s;ions of it awakned in you, as &s;hall excite you with a concerned Soul to &s;eek a De|liverance therefrom.</P>
<P>LET me al&s;o advi&s;e you, at the &s;ame time, to think of, and hope in the Mercy of GOD: Think, How He has proclaimed his Name to you, <HI>to be the Lord, the Lord GOD, gracious and merciful, &s;low to Anger, and of great Kindne&s;s, that unto Him belong Mercies and Forgivene&s;&s;es, tho' you have rebelled again&s;t Him;</HI> that He is therefore ready to forgive the Sins of Childhood and Youth, to pa&s;s by all your Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e He delights in Mercy, and takes Plea&s;ure in them that hope therein, and is willing to &s;hew Mercy to you according as you hope in Him.</P>
<P><HI>THINK</HI> on that word which he has &s;poken, that <HI>if the wicked will for&s;ake his Way, and return unto the Lord, He will have Mercy and abundantly pardon;</HI> and <HI>that,</HI> that if <HI>the wicked will turn from all his Sins which he has committed, and keep his Statutes, he &s;hall live, he &s;hall not die:</HI> Think on that Declara|tion of GOD, confirmed with an <HI>Oath,</HI> that <HI>He de|lights not in your Death, but had rather you would turn and live,</HI> and therefore thus expo&s;tulates with you, <HI>Turn ye, Turn ye, Why will ye die?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003153_0007_0FF080F58B1B9120">AND then <HI>think</HI> how that JESUS CHRIST is ex|alted at the right hand of GOD, <HI>to give Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins,</HI> and that he came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t, that he came that we might have Life, that we who are dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, may be quicken'd and made alive, that we might live a Life of Grace and Comfort here, and a Life of Immortality and Glory hereafter</P>
<P>THINK on the many gracious Calls and Invita|tions He gave to poor mi&s;erable Sinners while He was on Earth, and the &s;ame He now gives by his Mini&s;ters unto you. Think on that <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.2. <HI>Re|pent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</HI> And that, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. <HI>Come to me, all ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</HI> And that in <HI>John</HI> 7.37. <HI>If any Man thir&s;t, let him come unto me and drink of the Waters of life freely.</HI></P>
<P>THINK on that gracious A&s;&s;urance He has given you, in <HI>John</HI> 6.37. <HI>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> Think on that <HI>Revel.</HI> 3.20. <HI>Behold I &s;tand at the door and knock, if any man open the door, I will come into him, and &s;up with him, and he with me.</HI></P>
<P>THINK, how CHRIST has been &s;tanding for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, as young as you are, knocking by His Word, Spirit and Mini&s;ters, at the doors of your Souls for Entrance: By that and the other Word, as &s;uch and &s;uch a time, CHRIST knock'd at the door of your Soul, He call'd upon you to ari&s;e and let Him in, that He might no longer &s;tand without; and by &s;uch and &s;uch a Providence, by &s;uch a Sickne&s;s, or the Deaths of others, it may be, &s;ome &s;udden Death of that or the other young Per&s;on, CHRIST has
<PB N="8" REF="003153_0008_0FF080F94FB15968">
knock'd again at the door of your Soul for Entrance: Oh think of the&s;e loud Calls you have had to open to CHRIST, and no longer &s;hut him out of your Souls, and then think of your Sloth and Sluggi&s;hne&s;s, in re|fu&s;ing to awake and ari&s;e, and &s;eek to Him for Light and Life; how you have made him &s;tand without, and wait on you, till His Head has been wet with the Dew, and His Locks with the drops of the Night; how you have &s;ent Him away griev'd to &s;ee you refu&s;e a Compliance with His gracious Calls to you.</P>
<P>THINK, how his Bowels have notwith&s;tanding yern'd towards you, how His <HI>Heart has been turned within Him, and his Repentings kindled together,</HI> to think of <HI>gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> you up,</HI> therefore He is yet wait|ing on you that He may be gracious to you.</P>
<P>THINK of the Mercy of GOD to you in &s;ending Men, of the &s;ame Make and Frame with your &s;elves, to treat with you in the mo&s;t plain and familiar way, about the important Concerns of your Souls and E|ternity; that you may have ea&s;y Acce&s;s to them, and be directed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in your way to the heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<P>THINK, how your dear <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>faithful Friends</HI> are travailing in Birth for you again, until they can &s;ee CHRIST formed in your Souls.</P>
<P>THINK of the early Con&s;ecration your <HI>Parents</HI> made of you to GOD, how they &s;olemnly devoted you to the Service of GOD the FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST, in the <HI>&s;acred Bapti&s;m</HI> admini&s;ter'd to you, and have been frequently &s;ince, renewing the Dedication of you to GOD, in their fervent Prayers for you: Think, how often they have carry'd you
<PB N="9" REF="003153_0008_0FF080F94FB15968">
in the arms of their Faith and Prayer to GOD, begging His Pity and Mercy to you, that you might live before Him, that you might have your Hearts &s;ea&s;oned with His Fear, that GOD would give you a Heart to &s;eek and &s;erve Him in your early Days, that He would be your GOD, and the guide of your Youth, that you might be pre&s;erv'd from every Path of the De&s;troyer, and never forget the Covenant of your GOD, nor for&s;ake the Guide of your Youth, that you might, in &s;hort, be the Children of GOD, and Heirs of an heavenly Inheritance, that they might hereafter each one, be able to &s;ay, <HI>Here am I Lord, and the Children which thou did&s;t</HI> graciou&s;ly <HI>give unto thy Servant.</HI></P>
<P>THINK of the publick In&s;tructions, Exhortations and Calls, you have had from one time to another, how you have been entreated and urged by various per&s;wa&s;ive Motives and Arguments proper to work upon your Hopes and Fears, to awaken, excite and move you to a greater Care and Sollicitude about the <HI>One thing Needful.</HI> Con&s;ider often you mu&s;t give an Account to GOD, of the Means and Advantages you have enjoy'd, and that if you &s;hould finally peri&s;h, they will all &s;erve as heavy <HI>Items,</HI> to inflame your Reckoning in the Day of Accounts.</P>
<P>AND,</P>
<P>THINK much on that Day He hath appointed in which He will judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, by the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who &s;hall be the <HI>Judge both of Quick and Dead:</HI> Meditate frequently on the Awfulne&s;s of that <HI>Great and Terrible Day of the LORD,</HI> when CHRIST &s;hall de&s;cend from Heaven in His own Glory, and in His FATHER'S Glory, and with great Power, being commi&s;&s;ion'd and authoriz'd by GOD,
<PB N="10" REF="003153_0009_0FF080FAD9F52C10">
to be the Judge at that Day. Think how He will appear in the Clouds of Heaven, in &s;ome vi&s;ible bright Appearance, that will &s;urround His humane Nature, and how He will de&s;cend with the holy An|gels, tho&s;e bright and glorious Spirits, to execute His royal Will and Plea&s;ure, how that thou&s;and thou&s;ands of them mini&s;ter unto Him, and ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and &s;tand before Him to do His Plea&s;ure. And think al&s;o, how He will de&s;cend with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of GOD, and erect, and &s;eat Him&s;elf on a Throne of Glory, more glorious and magnificent, than any earthly Throne ever was, and He appear infinite|ly more glorious upon it, than any earthly Monarch ever did upon His Throne of fading Glory.</P>
<P>THINK, how the Dead will be rais'd and <HI>the Dead in CHRIST &s;hall ri&s;e fir&s;t,</HI> ari&s;e immediately up|on his De&s;cent from Heaven by the Voice of the An|gel, and afterwards the <HI>wicked</HI> al&s;o, for both mu&s;t appear before the Judgment-&s;eat of CHRIST. Think how incorruptible, immortal and glorious the Bodies of the Saints will be, and how frightful the Appearance of the Bodies of the Wicked, and the ignominious State they'l ari&s;e in, with all the marks of the divine Cur&s;e, vi&s;ible upon them: Think how they will tremble to appear before GOD, and dread to be drag'd away to His Bar, to their everla&s;ting Shame and Contempt.</P>
<P>THINK, how that when the Judgment is &s;et CHRIST &s;eated upon His Throne, and all Mankind brought into His Pre&s;ence, the Books &s;hall then be opened, the Book of divine Omni&s;cience, and the Book of Memory and Con&s;cience, wherein are re|corded all the Actions of every Man, with all the

Circum&s;tances that have attended them, whether good or evil, and the <HI>Book of Life</HI> in which the Names of all the Elect are written.

<P>THINK, how all good and bad will receive their Sentence according to the things written in tho&s;e Books; that there will be a' Sentence of Ab&s;olution pa&s;s'd upon the Righteous, that He will then &s;ay to &s;uch, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the King|dom prepared for you, from before the foundation of the World.</HI> And a Sentence of Condemnation upon the <HI>Wicked,</HI> according to their evil Deeds, even that, <HI>De|part from me ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI></P>
<P>THINK further, how there can be so Appeal from the Judgment-&s;eat of CHRIST, to an higher Tribunal, and that the Judge will never rever&s;e the Sentence: Think yet further, how that when the Judgment is over, CHRIST will a&s;cend in a glorious manner into the highe&s;t Heavens, with all the holy Angels and Saints accompanying of Him, and leave the <HI>Wicked</HI> with the Apo&s;tate Angels to &s;uffer the Vengeance of eternal Fire.</P>
<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P>THINK frequently, that you don't know how &s;oon this <HI>Great and terrible Day</HI> of the LORD may come upon you. <HI>Think</HI> whether the late EARTH|QUAKES may not have been Forerunners of it, &s;ince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Tokens</HI> are to precede it.</P>

<P>HOWEVER, before I have done <HI>&s;peaking</HI> to you, let me intreat you to ponder upon what has been &s;poken.</P>
<P>I have come hither to <HI>&s;peak</HI> to you, O our YOUNG PEOPLE, and Oh! if I might but be in&s;trumental of bringing you to a thoughtful frame of Soul, to think upon the things, I have directed and now ad|vi&s;ed you to employ your Thoughts upon: If you will from this time, become thus thoughtful of the <HI>things</HI> of your everla&s;ting Peace, I have gained a happy &s;tep towards your <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> and if I can gain no more <HI>this Evening</HI> than this, I will &s;ay, <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</HI></P>

<P>MY YOUNG PEOPLE, If you will not be per&s;wad|ed to be &s;erious and <HI>thoughtful,</HI> my labour with you, will be in vain; if it &s;hould be &s;o with re&s;pect to many here pre&s;ent, I hope it will not be &s;o with re&s;|pect to <HI>You</HI> in a particular manner, who are the <HI>Oc|ca&s;ion</HI> of my <HI>&s;peaking this Evening</HI> unto others, as well as unto You.</P>
<P>YOU certainly have been, and are <HI>thoughtful,</HI> and will be more &s;o, on the things I have advi&s;ed to, and therefore I tru&s;t it is, that you de&s;ire to be directed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in &s;uch a religious Combination as you propo&s;e, for religious Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>IF I thought you were not thoughtful, &s;erious and &s;ober-minded, and indeed concerned, that you might help forward the Salvation of your precious Souls, I would not appear with you here at this time, nor at all encourage you in &s;uch a <HI>Meeting.</HI> But I hope you are de&s;irous of &s;eeking and &s;erving the GOD of your Fathers, and promoting the Work of <HI>Reformation</HI> and <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> as to your &s;elves fir&s;t, and then by your good Examples in others.</P>

&s;uch a meeting together, and have had rea&s;on to be thankful to GOD therefor all their Days.</P>
<P>IT has been an Excitement to many to come and renew their <HI>Bapti&s;mal Covenant,</HI> and to prepare dili|gently for the <HI>Table</HI> of the LORD; and a means to excite tho&s;e that have done it, to a more watchful, circum&s;pect living and walking. Of &s;uch Advantage, I hope thro' Grace, it will be to you.</P>
<P>IF you would not defeat the good De&s;igns of &s;uch a meeting together, be very cautious and careful who you admit into your <HI>Society,</HI> don't pre&s;ently receive any that have been remarkably vain and trifling in their Deportment on the LORD'S-Days, or at other times, unle&s;s there has been ob&s;erv'd for a con&s;idera|ble time a <HI>Reformation.</HI></P>

<P>THE Eyes of GOD, Angels and Men will be upon you, to ob&s;erve your Conduct after &s;uch an a&s;&s;ociat|ing together for the Purpo&s;es of Religion.

But I would fain hope better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation, tho' I thus &s;peak.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know, that we &s;hall expect much from you, &s;ince GOD has put it into Your Hearts to meet thus together, from one LORD'S-Day Night to another.</P>
<P>YOUR Mini&s;ter, your Parents, the Church, and all that fear GOD, will expect to &s;ee you adorning the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of GOD your Saviour, which you have been in&s;tructed in, and do make Profe&s;&s;ion of.</P>
<P>AND to excite You, Con&s;ider, That we can have <HI>no greater Joy</HI> than to &s;ee you walking in the ways of Virtue and Holine&s;s, Wi&s;e for your Souls and E|ternity, and &s;o like to prove an <HI>in&s;tructed and a godly Seed,</HI> who &s;hall be <HI>accounted to the LORD for a Generation.</HI></P>

<P>YOU &s;hould never think your &s;elves too wi&s;e, or good, or old to receive proper Admonitions for what may be ami&s;s in you.

You are now at the turning time of Life, turn right now, and you are made for ever. Come and take CHRIST'S Yoke upon you, and you will find it ea&s;y: Try the Plea&s;ure there is in the Knowledge of GOD and CHRIST, and in Conver&s;e with &s;piritual Things; try the Plea&s;ure of Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Self-Denial, and you will find it far exceeds that of Vanity and Self-Indul|gence; Try the Plea&s;ure of Meditation on the Word of GOD, of Prayer, and Prai&s;e, and Sabbath Sancti|fication, and you will &s;oon find, you have made a happy Change of the Plea&s;ures of vain and carnal Mirth, for the&s;e true Delights. Reckon that the be&s;t Plea&s;ure, which will remain with you, and &s;tand you in &s;tead, when you come to die, which will help to take off the Terrors of Death, and allay its Pains.

<P>I now proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>REALIZE the Eye of GOD upon you.</HI> Set the LORD always before you, and at your right hand, that you may not be moved. Con&s;ider frequently, that the LORD is from Heaven continually looking down upon you, to &s;ee how you &s;eek and &s;erve Him: To &s;ee whether you <HI>keep your Hearts with all Dili|gence,</HI> to ob&s;erve your inward Frames and Tempers, how your thoughts are from time to time employ'd, and to ob&s;erve the Words which proceed out of your Mouths, whether there be any of that fooli&s;h talking and je&s;ting, which is not convenient, or whether i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be <HI>to the U&s;e of Edifying,</HI> and &s;uch as may <HI>mini&s;ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Grace to the Hearers;</HI> and to ob&s;erve your whole Conduct and Behaviour at all Times, and in all Pla|ces, and in every Condition and Circum&s;tance of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="003153_0025_0FF081262C2CC6E0">REALIZE the <HI>Omni&s;cience</HI> of GOD, <HI>that He &s;earch|es the Hearts and tries the Reins of the Children of Men,</HI> and that the mo&s;t &s;ecret Thoughts and Contrivances in your Minds, are as open and manife&s;t to his all-&s;eeing Eye, as any of the Actions of your Lives, and that there is a Day coming <HI>in which He will judge the &s;ecrets of Men by</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>according to his Go&s;pel.</HI> Endeavour to get the Con&s;ideration and Belief of this, &s;o impre&s;s'd upon your Minds, that you may be able, upon the mo&s;t alluring Sollici|tations, to repel the Tempter, as that pious Youth did, <HI>Gen.</HI> 39.9. <HI>How can I do this great Wickedne&s;s, and &s;in again&s;t GOD?</HI> It will be for your Credit and Honour, if you &s;hall be able to &s;ay, as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> did, <HI>Chap.</HI> 5.15. <HI>But &s;o did not I becau&s;e of the Fear of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>ALWAYS &s;tand in awe of GOD, when you are alone and no Creature &s;ees you; and be more con|cern'd to plea&s;e GOD, when retired from the Sight of Men, than when the World looks upon you: Dare not commit any thing that is offen&s;ive to GOD, or injurious to your Neighbour, becau&s;e of the Eye of GOD upon you.</P>
<P><Q>BEAR it upon your Minds, that no Place can e&s;cape the all-&s;eeing Eye of GOD, that there is no Corner &s;o &s;ecret, but <HI>the Father of Lights</HI> &s;hines into it. Remember that, that GOD who&s;e Eye is thus upon you, will call you to an Account for &s;ecret Sins, as well as for notorious Offences.</Q></P>
<P>INDEED, not to fear GOD (&s;ays One) when we are alone, is not to fear Him at all; and He that &s;huns indecencies before Men, only &s;hews, that they are the Gods whom he &s;erves. Sobriety be|fore

What doth it &s;ignify to believe a GOD, and to walk as if there were none? And to what Purpo&s;e is it to a|dore Him, when His Greatne&s;s can have no Influence upon our Con&s;ciences? To &s;ee in &s;ecret is GOD's Prerogative, and we then deny it, when in &s;ecret we dare break His Laws.</P>
<P><Q>HE could not be GOD if He took no Notice of our Thoughts and Actions, when we are alone, and therefore not to fear Him when we are in private, is to &s;ay with the <HI>Fool, There is no GOD.</HI> It is a perfect Contradiction to believe GOD's Omni&s;cience, and not to &s;tand in awe of it. If the whole World were pre&s;ent with us, or within our View, it is not &s;o much, as when GOD is pre&s;ent with us, when alone.</Q></P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t realize, that the <HI>LORD &s;earches you, and knows you, that he knows your down-&s;itting, and up-ri&s;ing, that he under&s;tands your Thoughts afar off, that he compa&s;&s;es your Path, and your lying down, and is acquainted with all your Ways, and will here|after give unto you according to your Ways, and the Fruit of your Doings.

<P>BEWARE of all the&s;e Ways, and every other Way, by which you may be Guilty of profaning or abu&s;ing the Name of GOD.

<P>YOU &s;hould the Day and Evening before, beg of GOD to rid your Hearts as well 2s your Hands, of whatever may unfit, or indi&s;po&s;e you for his Service thereon, that it may be a good Day to your Souls.</P>
<P>BE &s;ollicitous that when you awake in the Morn|ing, your Thoughts may be on GOD, and the Things of your everla&s;ting Peace, that pious &amp; holy Thoughts may take the fir&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Hearts, and abide there, throughout the Day.</P>
<P>TAKE the fir&s;t convenient Time, to retire and pray to your Father who &s;ees in &s;ecret, adoring His Mercy to you, in giving you to &s;ee the Light of a|nother <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and begging that He would by His Grace enable you, to keep a Sabbath of Re&s;t from Sin, and of Re&s;t in GOD, that <HI>you may be in the Fear of the LORD all the Day long;</HI> that His Pre&s;ence may go with you to the Hou&s;e of GOD, that He would meet and ble&s;s you there, and grace His own

You read in <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.7. <HI>The Prie&s;t lips &s;hould keep Knowledge, and you &s;hould &s;eek the Law at his Mouth, for he is the Me&s;&s;enger of the LORD of Ho&s;ts.</HI> You &s;hould hearken to their Me&s;&s;ages. You &s;hould hear|ken diligently to the Coun&s;els, Warnings and Admo|nitions delivered to you by them, in the Name and Fear of GOD, and regard them, as the Word of GOD, and not of Man.</P>
<P>CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters are his Amba&s;&s;adours, and He does by them be&s;eech you to be reconciled unto GOD, and what they deliver to you, agreeable to the Word of GOD, you ought as firmly to believe and regard it, as tho' CHRIST him&s;elf &s;pake to you in his own Per&s;on.</P>
<P>OUT of Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion to you, CHRIST &s;ends not Angels (who might rather terrify than in|&s;truct you) but Men of the &s;ame Make and Frame with your &s;elves, Men of like Pa&s;&s;ions, in the &s;ame guilty mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances, naturally, as you are, and who mu&s;t obtain and &s;ecure their own Sal|vation, in the &s;ame Way, upon the &s;ame Terms and Conditions, they propo&s;e to you; Unto their In|&s;tructions you mu&s;t therefore hearken, as for your Lives, with earne&s;t De&s;ires of being pric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d to the Heart by the preached Word, that it may become the Power of GOD to your Salvation.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="003153_0030_0FF08134119D8198">BUT to come to what I principally aim at, under this Head; As we have Freedom of Acce&s;s unto CHRIST'S Amba&s;&s;adors, and they are, or &s;hould be ea&s;y of Acce&s;s, &s;o you &s;hould willingly and freely re|pair unto them, as authoriz'd by the King and Head of his Church and People, to &s;hew to you the Way of Salvation, e&s;pecially if you are at any time un|der Convictions, and have good Impre&s;&s;ions upon your Minds cau&s;ed by the Word or Providences of GOD.</P>
<P>IF you evidently perceive the SPIRIT of GOD is &s;triving with you, and a &s;erious Concern is awaken'd about your Soul, and Eternity, you &s;hould improve every &s;uch happy Sea&s;on to go to &s;uch, and acquaint them with your <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> and de&s;ire their Advice and Coun&s;el, that &s;uch Convictions may have a good I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>YOU &s;hould look on this to be a Way of GOD, an Ordinance of GOD appointed for your Good, and with &s;uch a View, attend it, and not any longer cheri&s;h &s;uch a criminal Backwardne&s;s to your Duty in this Regard.</P>
<P>WHEN you are really concern'd about the State of your Soul, and what is like to become of you to all Eternity, and are de&s;irous of knowing what the LORD would have you to do, you &s;hould at &s;uch a Time, with Freedom and Re&s;olution, go and open your Ca&s;e, unbo&s;om your &s;elf to &s;ome faithful godly Friend, or Mini&s;ter, and ask their Direction and Help and Thoughts upon your <HI>Ca&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I am verily afraid, that many Convictions have been lo&s;t, and Impre&s;&s;ions defac'd, and worn off, for want of taking this Method.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="003153_0030_0FF08134119D8198">IF when you were under C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tions, and Con|cern of Soul about your &s;piritual State, you had comply'd with your Duty in this Regard, it would have had a happy Tendency to have cheri&s;h'd and &s;et home your Convictions, and &s;o have help'd for|ward your <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> to GOD. May the Con&s;ide|ration and Hope of this encourage you to do &s;o, under the Convictions and Impre&s;&s;ions, you may have upon your Minds, for time to come.</P>
<P>I now proceed to another Particular.</P>
<P>LET me advi&s;e you while I am &s;peaking to you, <HI>to attend diligently the publick Wor&s;hip of GOD.

<P>LET me advi&s;e you in the next Place,</P>
<P><HI>TO renew your bapti&s;mal Covenant.</HI> You are (I &s;uppo&s;e all of you) the baptized Di&s;ciples of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. You were early dedicated to GOD, in the holy Ordinance of <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> and now, when you come to Years of Di&s;cretion, and Under|&s;tanding, you &s;hould make it your own Act and Deed.</P>
<P>YOU are taught by the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Gal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>That as many of you, as have been baptized into CHRIST, have put on CHRIST, i. e.</HI> have put on the Name of

Di&s;ciples and Followers of CHRIST, and are therefore obliged to make &s;uch publick Profe&s;&s;ion, and explicitly own and avouch the LORD to be Your GOD, and not be afraid or a&s;ham'd to acknowledge the Truths and Ways of CHRIST. If you do not do &s;o, how will you fru&s;trate the great De&s;ign of your Bapti&s;m, by which you became &s;o early engaged to <HI>&s;eek and &s;erve the GOD of your Fathers?</HI></P>
<P>AND how can you expect, or hope for the Ble&s;|&s;ings of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> if you will not lay hold upon it, con&s;ent to the Terms of it, and walk according to the Tenour of it? You &s;hould then mo&s;t cer|tainly not content your &s;elves, with the <HI>Dedication</HI> your Parents made of you to GOD, at your Bapti&s;m, but renew and take upon you, your <HI>bapti&s;mal Vow</HI> and Covenant, &s;olemnly promi&s;ing by his Grace help|ing of you, that <HI>you will fear GOD, and keep his Commandments always, that it may be well with you for ever.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, you are very thoughtful of your Duty, in this re&s;pect, &s;uch of you, as have not yet done it, and that your religious Exerci&s;es, from one Week to another, will have a good Tendency to prepare you for, and excite and quicken you to it.</P>
<P>LET me advi&s;e you in the next Place,</P>
<P><HI>TO be concern'd to get prepared for the LORD's Table.</HI> The Invitation is made unto you, as well as tho&s;e that are in their elder Years, to come and &s;hew forth CHRIST'S Death and Sufferings in Remembrance of Him. <HI>This do in Remembrance of me,</HI> obliges <HI>you</HI> as well as others, and while you neglect to do it, you live in the Omi&s;&s;ion of a plain commanded Duty.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="003153_0031_0FF0813712A4C808">YOUR SAVIOUR would be glad to &s;ee you thus remembring of Him, <HI>in the Days of your Youth.</HI> He is de&s;irous of e&s;pou&s;ing you to Him&s;elf, that you may be married to Him, and obtain all the Ble&s;&s;ings of a &s;ure and well-ordered Covenant.

<P>WHEREFORE beg, that you may be brought to hunger and thir&s;t after the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, and that you may be prepared by his Spirit and Grace, for the ob|taining of them in the Ways of His Appointment.</P>

<P><HI>TO get and keep a good Con&s;cience.</HI> Seek earne&s;t|ly to have your Con&s;ciences &s;prinkled with the Blood of CHRIST, that you may enjoy Peace of Con&s;cience.

Be always concern'd that your Hearts may not reproach you for comply|ing with any evil Sollicitations. Endeavour what in you lies, <HI>to keep a Con&s;cience void of Offence, both to|wards GOD, and towards Man.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I ha&s;ten to &s;ay, in the next Place,</P>
<P><HI>GRIEVE not the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD, but cheri&s;h his holy Motions upon your Hearts, from one time to another.</HI> The SPIRIT of GOD is doubtle&s;s often &s;triving with you, exciting good Motions in your Minds, under the Word and Providences of GOD; &s;ee to it that you con&s;tantly cheri&s;h them. Do not
<PB N="56" REF="003153_0032_0FF08138A69F38E8">
by any &s;inful Temper or Carriage, provoke the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD to withdraw from you. GOD has &s;aid, His SPIRIT <HI>&s;hall not always &s;trive with Man.</HI> Men may by their unwary fooli&s;h Carriages, forfeit the gracious Influences of the SPIRIT of GOD, upon which he may depart from them.</P>
<P>AND how &s;ad will your Ca&s;e be, if you &s;hould provoke the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD to for&s;ake you! You would then live, only to fill up the <HI>mea&s;ure of your Iniquities, and to trea&s;ure up to your &s;elves Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath, and the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>OH then &s;ee to it, That you do <HI>not quench the SPIRIT!</HI> Carefully ob&s;erve all his inward and &s;e|cret Motions, under Ordinances, and under Provi|dences, with an earne&s;t Concern, your Convictions may i&s;&s;ue in your &s;aving and thorough Conver&s;ion to GOD.</P>
<P>I come now to the la&s;t Word to be &s;poken to you, at this time, and that is,</P>
<P><HI>TO prepare for Death, and the eternal World.</HI> Do not any of you <HI>boa&s;t of a to morrow, for you know not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> How many of your Age are gone down to the Grave, and gone to their long and eternal Home? And how &s;oon it &s;hall be thus &s;aid of you, you don't know. Oh meditate on your Frailty and Mortality every Day you live!

<P><PB N="57" REF="003153_0032_0FF08138A69F38E8">OH go away, and immediately bewail it with Grief of Heart, and re&s;olve by the Help of GOD, you will abandon every evil way, that you will be now <HI>working out your Salvation with Fear and Trem|bling,</HI> that you will &s;trive more <HI>to enter in at the &s;trait Gate,</HI> and even <HI>take the Kingdom of Heaven by a holy Violence.</HI></P>
<P>BE re&s;tle&s;s until you have got into a State of Safe|ty for Eternity: <HI>Give noe Sleep to your Eyes, nor Slumber to your Eye-lids,</HI> until you have humbly and earne&s;tly &s;ought the Favour of GOD, in pardoning, renewing and &s;anctifying of you, and taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of you for him&s;elf, that He would rule and reign in your hearts, that His Divine and Holy Image may be wrought into all the Powers of your Souls.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT there are many things to be &s;poken to Young People, which the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST &s;hould be &s;peedy and earne&s;t in the &s;peaking of unto them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="64" REF="003153_0036_0FF0814686762108">UNDER this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> I have particularly &s;hewn,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>WHAT Things may be proper to be &s;poken to Young People.</HI></P>
<P>I am now to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THAT the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST &s;hould be &s;peedy and earne&s;t in &s;peaking &s;uch Things unto them.</HI></P>
<P>FOR the Proof and <HI>Confirmation</HI> of this, we may con&s;ider &s;everal Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of GOD may be now &s;triving with &s;uch, and therefore the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST &s;hould be &s;peedy and earne&s;t in the &s;peaking the&s;e things unto them.</HI></P>
<P>THE HOLY SPIRIT of GOD is frequently &s;triving with, and moving on the Hearts of &s;uch. Such is the <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Long-&s;uffering</HI> of GOD, that He bears with them, though they have too much <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed the Riches of His Goodne&s;s.</HI> He waits to be gracious, and is therefore by the Sugge&s;tions of His HOLY SPIRIT, evidently intimating to &s;uch, there is <HI>Hope</HI> concerning them; that <HI>it is now an accepted Time, and a Day of Salvation;</HI> that there <HI>is Mercy with GOD, and For|givene&s;s</HI> for them, that if they will be now <HI>working out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling, the LORD will work in them, both to will and to do, of his own good Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>THE SPIRIT of GOD &s;o &s;ets home the preached Word, that they are &s;ometimes prick'd to the Heart by it, and convinc'd of <HI>Sin, of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of
<PB N="65" REF="003153_0036_0FF0814686762108">
Judgment to come.</HI> They have a mighty Concern a|wakned in them, about what they &s;hall do, that they may be &s;aved. Their great Inquiry now is, <HI>LORD, What wilt thou have me to do?</HI> And, <HI>What &s;hall I do, that I may inherit eternal Life?</HI></P>
<P>THEY now &s;ee them&s;elves in continual Danger of the amazing Wrath of GOD overtaking them, while in an unconverted E&s;tate, and are more concerned, than ever they were, to make their E&s;cape from it, and are now with greater Concern, than ever, wait|ing on GOD, in the u&s;e of the Means appointed for their <HI>Conver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, this is a &s;pecial and <HI>peculiar Sea&s;on,</HI> for the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of CHRIST to improve, in treating with &s;uch, and if they are now earne&s;tly intreating, per&s;wading and exhorting of them, to <HI>&s;trive NOW to enter in at the &s;trait Gate,</HI> to <HI>&s;eek fir&s;t the Kingdom of GOD;</HI> Now, the Go&s;pel of the Kingdom is preach|ed, to pre&s;s into it, to mind this <HI>one thing needful</HI> in the fir&s;t Place, and before every thing el&s;e, to make Religion and the Care of their Souls Salvation their principal Bu&s;ine&s;s and Concern, and &s;ubordinate eve|ry thing el&s;e to it; and therefore immediately <HI>&s;eek the LORD, while He may be found, and call upon Him white He is near,</HI> and re&s;olve <HI>not to let Him go, until He ble&s;s them,</HI> until they &s;hall <HI>receive the Ble&s;&s;ing from the LORD, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s from the GOD of their Salvation.</HI></P>

<P>KNOWING your continual Danger, becau&s;e of your wicked Hearts, a tempting Devil, and an en|&s;naring World, we cannot but faithfully warn and call upon you, to for&s;ake the Paths of the De&s;troyer, and get into the Way of Life, and u&s;e all the proper Motives and Arguments we can think of, to excite you to your Duty; and herein di&s;charge our Duty to GOD, and to you, that we may not incur the Doom of unfaithful Servants, which you know we &s;hall, if we do not our utmo&s;t, to &s;ave your Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from Death.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>WE &s;hould give thanks to the King and Head of His Church and People, when favour'd with faithful Am|ba&s;&s;adors.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF we have Rea&s;on to hope and believe, that they who bring the Me&s;&s;ages of Peace and Reconciliation to us, have at Heart the Honour and Glory of GOD, and are earne&s;tly and &s;incerely endeavouring that we may be brought to a &s;incere Repentance, and thorough Conver&s;ion to GOD; if while they are running and &s;peaking to us, their Me&s;&s;ages evidently tend to pro|mote our &s;piritual Benefit and Advantage, if we would but hearken to, and comply with them; we have certainly cau&s;e of Thankfulne&s;s to GOD, in appointing an Order of Men, of the &s;ame Make and Frame with our &s;elves, thus familiarly to treat with us, yea and intreat, and be&s;eech us to hear, that our Souls may live.</P>
<P>WERE our Teachers removed into Corners; or, were they unfaithful; were they &s;uch as would <HI>daub with untemper'd Mortar, and preach &s;mooth Things to us,</HI> and flatter us in our evil Ways, and &s;uffer us to go on quietly in a Cour&s;e of Sin; What a tremendous Judgment of GOD would this be?</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="003153_0044_0FF0815D9ED55B38">OH let us be thankful then that <HI>our Eyes yet &s;ee our Teachers,</HI> and that we have the Mind and Will of GOD faithfully di&s;pens'd unto us. And let us beware, we dont provoke GOD by our Unprofitable|ne&s;s and Unfruitfulne&s;s under &s;uch a merciful Di&s;|pen&s;ation, to remove our Candle&s;ticks out of their Places, or to put out the <HI>Lights,</HI> He has &s;et up in them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>HOW readily then &s;hould you hearken to the Me&s;&s;a|ges they bring unto you?</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF it &s;o highly concerns them to be &s;peedy and ear|ne&s;t in bringing the Me&s;&s;ages of GOD to you, it cer|tainly does as much concern you, to give a &s;peedy and ready Entertainment to them; <HI>for it is for your Life.</HI> The Lives of your precious Souls depend upon your hearkening to them. You are undone for ever, if you finally per&s;i&s;t in your Di&s;obedience to their Me&s;&s;ages.</P>

<HEAD>USE III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>HOW di&s;couraging mu&s;t it be to run in vain?</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN we obey the Command of our LORD and Ma&s;ter, in bringing his Me&s;&s;ages to you, that are of the la&s;t Concernment, and u&s;e with you all proper Motives and Arguments to work upon your Hopes and upon your Fears; and yet your Language is like theirs, in <HI>Jer.</HI> 44.16. <HI>As for the Word that thou ha&s;t &s;poken unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee:</HI> How di&s;couraging mu&s;t it be? To give up our Account to GOD every Day,
<PB N="82" REF="003153_0045_0FF0815F81861748">
concerning you, that you are &s;till walking in the Ways of your Hearts, and in the Sight of your Eyes, Strangers to any &s;anctifying &s;aving Work of GOD's HOLY SPIRIT upon your Hearts; that you will not be per&s;waded to repent and turn from your Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, but are lovers of Plea&s;ures, more than lov|ers of GOD, and after them will go, let <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> &s;ay what they will, yea, though your own Con&s;ciences check you, and the SPIRIT of GOD is &s;triving with you, and Providences loudly &s;peak too: All Means and Pains u&s;ed and taken with you, are lo&s;t upon you, you continue as vain, &s;ecure and tho'tle&s;s about the Concerns of your immortal Souls as ever.</P>
<P>AND thus <HI>You</HI> receive the Grace of GOD in vain, and <HI>We</HI> labour in vain, and <HI>&s;pend our Strength for nought and in vain;</HI> we had as good e'en <HI>prophe&s;y to the wind.</HI> Oh how di&s;couraging and di&s;heartning, to think, that the Word we &s;peak to you, is like to become a Savour of Death unto Death, and we are like to be a Means of aggravating your Condemna|tion hereafter!</P>
<P>THIS is very grievous to think of now, grievous to <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and to <HI>Parents;</HI> Why will you then &s;o grieve and break our Hearts? Why will you thus requite us for all our Care and Pains for the Salva|tion of your precious Souls? O ungrateful and un|wi&s;e that you are! You will &s;ee and own it &s;ooner or later; and the LORD grant you may, before it be too late!</P>

<HEAD>USE IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>LET me now beg of You, in the Name of Him who &s;ends me this Evening to you, that you would do your Utmo&s;t to hear and obey the Me&s;&s;ages, I have brought unto you, that I may not run in vain.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>NOW then I am an Amba&s;&s;ador for CHRIST, as though GOD did be&s;eech you by me, I pray you in CHRIST'S &s;tead, be ye reconciled unto GOD.</HI> I per|&s;wade my &s;elf, You que&s;tion not <HI>my</HI> Authority, as an Amba&s;&s;ador of the LORD JESUS CHRIST: And You will, I hope, regard what I &s;peak to you, as the Word of GOD, and not of Man. Believe it, the LORD has been &s;peaking to You from Heaven, and He takes &s;pecial Notice of your Regard to what is &s;poken.</P>
<P>I am per&s;waded, Your Con&s;ciences mu&s;t witne&s;s for me, that what I have been now and before &s;peak|ing to you from this <HI>Text,</HI> is agreeable to the Mind and Will of GOD, and that it is of infinite Concern|ment to you, to obey the Voice of your <HI>Teacher,</HI> and incline your Ears to the In&s;tructions that have been given you.</P>
<P>AND I would fain hope, that I have not <HI>run,</HI> and <HI>&s;poke</HI> in vain, as to &s;ome of the YOUNG PEOPLE of my Charge. I have &s;ome Rea&s;on to hope, what I have &s;aid, has been awakening and quickening to &s;ome, and that they will do their utmo&s;t, I may not labour in vain as to <HI>them;</HI> that they will conti|nue <HI>working out their Salvation with Fear and Trem|bling, and give all Diligence to make their Calling and Election &s;ure, that they may he found of their

Judge in Peace, and be &s;et before the Pre&s;ence of his Glory with exceeding Joy.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, through the infinite Grace of GOD, there will be found &s;ome &s;uch Seals of <HI>my Mini&s;try</HI> among You, concerning whom, Oh that I may have cau&s;e to &s;ay in the Day that is approaching, <HI>Here am I LORD, and the Children which were begotten to Thee, by my Mini&s;try!</HI> Then will <HI>You be my Joy and Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of the LORD!</HI></P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t have done <HI>&s;peaking</HI> to you, but how loth am I to leave &s;peaking, until I have per&s;waded and prevail'd with You to become the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD; How fain would I gain the Con&s;ent of your Souls to be the LORD'S, to hear and obey His Voice, before I have done <HI>&s;peaking</HI> to you?</P>
<P>GOD is my Witne&s;s, whom I would &s;erve with <HI>my Spirit in the Go&s;pel of His Son,</HI> that my Hearts de|&s;ire and Prayer for you is, that You may be &s;aved.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t I can &s;ay concerning You, as the Apo&s;tle did of his <HI>Philippians; Chap.</HI> 1.7, 8. <HI>I have you in my Heart, for GOD is my Record, how greatly I long after, you all, in the Bowels of JESUS CHRIST. And this I pray, that your Love may abound yet more and more, in Knowledge, and in all Judgment. That ye may approve the Things that are excellent, that ye may be &s;incere and without Offence till the Day of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>THUS are we praying, and will continue to pray for you, and the more earne&s;tly as to &s;uch of you, concerning whom we may have too much Cau&s;e to fear, and &s;ay as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, concerning &s;ome of his Hearers, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.11. <HI>I am afraid of you,

left I have be&s;towed on you labour in vain.</HI> Will you be &s;urpriz'd, if I tell you, I look for no other, but to have this heavy Trial &s;till, with re&s;pect to &s;ome of you, That I have <HI>run and &s;poken in vain!</HI></P>
<P>BUT I hope you will do more than you have done, that there may be no Cau&s;e for &s;uch a Com|plains; that you will now immediately re&s;olve, that by the Grace of GOD helping of you, you will &s;eek and cry more for an hearing Ear and an under&s;tand|ing Heart, that you may &s;o hear what is &s;poken from one time to another, as that your Souls may live. If you will not be per&s;waded to do this, I have hitherto <HI>&s;poken</HI> in vain.</P>
<P>I will now put over all I have &s;aid and done, into the Hands of the Almighty SPIRIT of Grace, the Wind that bloweth where it li&s;teth.</P>
<P><HI>OH almighty SPIRIT of Grace, do Thou come down, and breathe upon our Children and Young People. By thine inward efficacious Influences, make the Calls that have been given to them effectual, and thy free and &s;overeign Grace &s;hall have the Prai&s;e of it. AMEN.</HI></P>
