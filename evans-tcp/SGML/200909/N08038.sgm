<P>IN the appearance, which is not of man, nor according to man, I looked, and beheld a great mountain;</P>
<P N="1">1&mdash;2 And thereon &s;tood candle&s;ticks of gold, of &s;ilver, of bra&s;s and iron, and in them were candles, &s;ome of them burning bright and clear, and &s;ome appeared dull, and almo&s;t gone out, and &s;ome were gone out quite.</P>
<P N="3">3 And others were covered with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to defend them from &s;torms, for they were all &s;tanding open to the firmament; and whil&s;t I looked, behold, the light of the &s;un di&s;appeared for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on, and clouds, and darkne&s;s, and &s;torms, and tempe&s;ts, came and beat upon the mountain; then the candle|&s;ticks (which were men) were left in thick darkne&s;s, for their candles were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> out, and &s;ome of them overthrown; and whil&s;t I was looking off the walls of the mountain, which was built of pure gold and precious &s;tones,</P>
<P N="4">4 There appeared a numerous company from another coun|try, following <HI>ignus fatus,</HI> and their leader rode a &s;carlet colour|ed bea&s;t, and his name was Oppre&s;&s;ion and Defence; and when they that &s;at in darkne&s;s upon the mountain, &s;aw the multitude which came forth, they went forth from the mountain, and broke over the precious walls that were round it, and went to the leader of the multitude, and honoured him with great honour, and &s;ome joined with him in his ho&s;t, and followed <HI>ignus fatus,</HI> and they rejoiced, &s;aying, We will do valiently, for our God is with us, and we will tread down our enemies, and every one that ri&s;eth up to oppre&s;s us; and others gave him money and many great gifts, &s;aying, Go forth with thy army, and bear down tho&s;e &s;torms and tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P N="5">5 So he went forth with his company, and fought again&s;t, but could not prevail; and they which remained in darkne&s;s upon the mountain <HI>(a),</HI> made war with the golden candle&s;ticks, who&s;e light appeared bright, and cea&s;ed not from &s;hining; but they were not able &s;o much as to dim the light thereof neither they nor the tempe&s;ts that beat again&s;t them; For they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to a great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, which was in the mid&s;t of the mountain.</P>
<P N="6">6 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> they who were in darkne&s;s, were grievou&s;ly perplexed and pricked in their hearts, and gathered them&s;elves together, <HI>(a)</HI> and con&s;idered one with another, &s;aying, Let us <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our|&s;elves places of refuge, whereunto we may flee in time of trou|ble <HI>(b);</HI> and they took the holy name of the God of heaven in vain,

&s;aying, He will be with us, and go forth with our armies; and they made them&s;elves preparations for war war <HI>(c).</HI></P>
<P N="7">7 And as I looked, one came forth in his glorious appear|ance, and cried, &s;aying, Cea&s;e ye to make unto your&s;elves mar|tial preparations, and in&s;truments of war and of defence; for behold, there is in this mountain a &s;afe biding place <HI>(a);</HI> and the walls they are &s;ure <HI>(b):</HI> But many believed not, for they were in darkne&s;s, and hardne&s;s of heart overcame them, &s;o that they gave no heed unto him nor his me&s;&s;engers, which he &s;ent unto many that remain exerci&s;ing them&s;elves in martial manner: and there came forth a voice from on high, &s;aying to him to appeared, Remove the golden wall and bulwarks from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> this mountain, for they have exalted them&s;elves in their own &s;trength <HI>(c),</HI> and have forgotten the might power, which is a place of refuge in the mid&s;t thereof <HI>(d),</HI> who built the walls, and &s;et the candle&s;ticks, and light the candles that are therein; and he &s;aid, Let the tower remain therein <HI>(e),</HI> and he that is able to flee unto it, let him flee, and be &s;afe, for I am deter|mined what I will do unto this place.</P>
<P N="8">8 And &s;uddenly the walls, which were of gold and precious &s;tones, were taken away from about the mountain, and the wild boar of the fore&s;t entered into the borders thereof, and raged in his fury, for his chains were loo&s;ed <HI>(a),</HI> and he was relea&s;ed out of his pri&s;on, and began to remove many candle|&s;ticks, and a&s;&s;ayed to de&s;troy the whole mountain, and the cry of the widow and orphans began to be heard in the land, and they were greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed who tru&s;ted in the holy name of JESUS, who&s;e light &s;till appeared; and they mourned and wept for the candle&s;ticks that were removed out of their places and for the golden walls that were taken from about them <HI>(b).</HI></P>
<P N="9">9 And there appeared an angel of the Highe&s;t, having in the right hand golden &s;nuffers, and he pa&s;&s;ed through the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the mountain, and &s;nuffed the candles that were dim, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the golden oil, running through the golden pipes, from the two golden olives that &s;tand before the Lord on high, and he &s;nake comfortably unto them, and told them, that it was for the cur&s;ed &s;odomy <HI>(a),</HI> and great for&s;aking the Lord their God, that they were thus judged; but he &s;aid, Fear ye not, although the ancient walls are removed from about this place, it is but that the wicked may have the reward of their works, and the land be clean&s;ed from the pollutions thereof, for there is an hor|rible rebellion in the land, and turning a&s;ide from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of the righteous, provoking the Holy One by &s;in and tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and breaking the holy covenant of the mo&s;t high God.</P>
<P N="10">10. Thus &s;aith the Lord, I have turned my hand again&s;t this place for evil, and I will give the people over to the furnace of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and he that cometh forth, &s;hall be as pure <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in trea&s;ure, more pure than the golden wedge of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

that cometh not forth, is he who de&s;pi&s;eth my holy covenant, and I will for&s;ake him, and give him over to the tormentor, and I will remove his candle&s;tick out of its place, and there &s;hall be dreadful weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth, and there &s;hall be a great overturning in the land, &s;aith the Lord:</P>
<P N="11">11 For behold, as I have threatened them with famine, and to let the &s;word in upon them, and have &s;courged them in their borders for their wickedne&s;s, but they have refu&s;ed to humble them&s;elves, and have lift up the heel again&s;t me,</P>
<P N="12">12 And de&s;pi&s;ed the meek appearance of the me&s;&s;engers of the holy covenant <HI>(a),</HI> they have made the wicked world their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, they wor&s;hip it day and night, and when they gather in their mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly, behold, it is in their mind, cur&s;ing, &s;wearing, drunkenne&s;s, whoring, theft, chambering and wan|tonne&s;s, and all manner of abominations is in their borders; and yet, &s;aith the Lord, they will afflict them&s;elves with fa&s;t|ing, and put up their prayers, &s;aying, Lord, &s;ave us <HI>(b),</HI> whil&s;t their hearts thir&s;t after the blood of their enemies, whom I have &s;uffered to come upon them <HI>(c).</HI></P>
<P N="13">13 But thus &s;aith the Lord, I will accept of none of your prayers, your fa&s;tings or afflictions of body; but I will &s;uffer to come upon you the waters of a mighty river, who&s;e floods &s;hall go over the banks of the land of <HI>Emanuel,</HI> the &s;treams thereof &s;hall over&s;pread the whole land, and there &s;hall be great af|fliction, which &s;hall not cea&s;e till &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion be en|tirely &s;wept away.</P>
<P N="14">14 In this time many &s;hall &s;trive to flee to the &s;trong tower, which is in the mid&s;t of the mountain, but none &s;hall be able (<HI>a</HI>) except them who&s;e candles remain burning, and who&s;e light &s;hines in their borders; they &s;hall &s;trive, and &s;hall be able, and &s;hall have the &s;ongs of &s;alvation, and &s;ing upon the banks of deliverance; they &s;hall &s;ay, Not by our might, nor by our power, but by the Spirit of our God are we &s;aved <HI>(b)</HI> from our enemies, whil&s;t they who believed not, having heard, &s;uffer for their &s;ins.</P>
<P N="15">15 Then I looked, and behold, the wild boar of the fore&s;t continued to make war in the mountain, and &s;lew many in her <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and took many captive, men, women and children; then the candle&s;ticks which were of &s;ilver, of bra&s;s and of iron, and many dark candle&s;ticks, ro&s;e up to re&s;i&s;t him, and they fought again&s;t him, and &s;mote him in his hinder parts, and wounded him a little, but they could not prevail again&s;t him; then they cried aloud again&s;t the golden candle&s;ticks, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Our wives and children are taken captives, and our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> by the &s;word of them that are no people, and you will not ari&s;e for our help; and power was given them to oppre&s;s the golden can candle&s;ticks for a time. Then the golden candle&s;ticks were &s;ilent, and greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for a &s;ea&s;on; then they aro&s;e,
<PB N="5" REF="010258_0005_0F7E2470572E0560">
and &s;ome of them went forth, and joined with the candle&s;ticks of &s;ilver, bra&s;s and of iron, becau&s;e of the oppre&s;&s;ion that was upon them.</P>
<P N="16">16 And they which remained, gathered them&s;elves together upon the top of the mountain, and &s;at &s;ilent <HI>(a)</HI> for a time, be|fore the great tower that was in the mid&s;t thereof, and many were pained in their hearts, and lifted up their voice to the great Lord of Sabaoth, becau&s;e of the great di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and carrying away captive in the land.</P>
<P N="17">17 Neverthele&s;s it plea&s;ed the Lord of Sabaoth to continue his judgments for a time, and a time. But as they continued crying and humbling them&s;elves before him, imploring help of his &s;acred Maje&s;ty for them&s;elves and the people, it plea&s;ed him in his infinite goodne&s;s <HI>(a)</HI> to command the boar of the fore&s;t to return from their border, and he chained him with &s;trong chains <HI>(b),</HI> and put a hook in his jaw, and drew him back into the wilderne&s;s, and the mountain was at re&s;t for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on; but the walls thereof was not &s;ince <HI>(c)</HI> built, neither &s;hall be for the days of many generations, &s;aith the Lord.</P>
<P N="18">18 And about this time the candle&s;ticks of &s;liver, of bra&s;s and of iron exerci&s;ed authority over the golden candle&s;ticks, and would have overthrown them, but they could not, by rea|&s;on of the tower, which was in the mountain, whereunto abi|lity was given them to flee.</P>
<P N="19">19 And behold, the wind of heaven aro&s;e, and blew upon the mountain, and the waters of a great river came forth, and pa&s;&s;ed over the mountain, and there was a great earthquake, and after that a great furnace, who&s;e burning was as the burn|ing of lime, and the candle&s;ticks of &s;ilver, of bra&s;s and of iron were ca&s;t into the furnace, and the fire thereof burned in them, and all they which came forth out of the furnace, were as pure gold; but they which came not out, were no more, but as fuel of fire, and many golden candle&s;ticks were refined therein; and as I looked, there appeared candles in all of them which came out of the furnace, which were all of pure gold <HI>(a)</HI> &s;et round with precious &s;tones.</P>
<P N="20">20 And one of great power rent the heavens above, and came down, having in his right hand a live coal, which he had taken from the holy altar of the mo&s;t high God, and he touched the candles therewith, and the light appeared; and I looked, and the waters of the great river a&s;&s;uaged, and there was a calm <HI>(a),</HI> and the golden candle&s;ticks (which were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">|fect men and women) went up to the top of the mountain, re|joining; but the furnace remained in the mountain, that at any time, if any ru&s;t appeared on any, they might be refined there|in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> that came down from above, held golden &s;nuffers in his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hand, that if any candles appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, he might clip them, that their light might renew its &s;trength; he al&s;o
<PB N="6" REF="010258_0006_0F7E247195E91D98">
had power over the two golden olives and their two pipes, and he commanded them, that they &s;hould pour forth of the golden oil into the golden candle&s;ticks. I al&s;o &s;aw the peaceable &s;treams of Shiloh, de&s;cending upon the mountain, and they were as pure gold, clear as cry&s;tal <HI>(b);</HI> and he that held the golden &s;nuffers, who&s;e appearance was like unto the Son of God, calling unto them that &s;tood upon the mountain, &s;aying, Come and drink freely of this new wine of the kingdom of God; and they came and drank thereof, and &s;ung prai&s;es unto him that lives for ever and ever, and honoured and wor&s;hipped him in the beauty of holine&s;s <HI>(c);</HI> and he that called them, made a covenant with them, that they &s;hould be his people, and he would be their God.</P>
<P N="21">21 And &s;aid, There hath been in this mountain wars and blood&s;heds, and many of my people have erred therein, and have &s;trayed from the good Shepherd, who was meek and low in heart, and gave his life for the &s;heep, who, when he was reviled, reviled not again, but patiently &s;uffered all things, that the will of the Father might be done; and &s;o ought my people to have done, that my will might be done in them, and not have di&s;tru&s;ted the power of the Highe&s;t, and made fle&s;h their arm; nor gone forth in martial,&mdash;that is productive of &s;in, mi&s;ery and blood&s;hed, for it is contrary to my will and the glo|rious di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel <HI>(a)</HI> to mankind; whereby many have &s;hone as lights in the world, which many in this land have rejected; not in this land only, but upon the face of the whole earth <HI>(b).</HI></P>
<P N="22">22 But it &s;hall not be &s;o in time to come; for, &s;aith the Lord, I will e&s;tabli&s;h peace upon all the earth: And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that he that formeth any in&s;trument of war, &s;hall be a&s;hamed thereof, and I will judge him at the la&s;t day. The roaring of cannon, and the beating of drums, &s;hall not be heard, the glittering &s;word and all the in&s;truments of war, &s;hall cea&s;e, and the prophecy of my anointed &s;hall come to pa&s;s; nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, nor learn war any more, for the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it, and it &s;hall &s;urely come to pa&s;s, notwith&s;tanding many nations and great kings <HI>(b)</HI> oppo&s;e its coming. Behold, &s;aith the Lord, they are but as gra&s;shoppers, and fade as the flower of the earth, and go to a dark hou&s;e of &s;ilence, and are &s;een of men no more.&mdash;Therefore give ear, my people, unto my words, and incline your hearts to wi&s;dom, and learn under&s;tanding, that ye may know the will of God, and do it, and you &s;hall have peace from your enemies round about; and I will build about you the walls and bulwarks of my &s;alvation; and you &s;hall know the Lord your God have vi&s;ited you for good, and have &s;aved you from your enemies. Al&s;o, you were not able to &s;ave your&s;elves in time of trouble; and it &s;hall be as long as you remain faith|ful

<P N="23">23 And I will break down the walls which I have &s;et about you, and they &s;hall be no more for ever: For behold, I brought your Fathers from a land, wherein they were oppre&s;&s;ed <HI>(a),</HI> and could not &s;erve me freely, and I moved the heathen back, for their &s;akes; not by the power of the &s;word, nor by the &s;trength of battle, but I my&s;elf rebuked them, &s;aying, that they &s;hould not de&s;troy mine anointed, nor do my people any harm; and I fed your fathers in the wilderne&s;s many days, and gave them &s;trength to cultivate the land, and ble&s;&s;ed their labours with &s;ucce&s;s, and gave them corn in abundance, and good things, and they encrea&s;ed in the land, and their generations were in pro&s;perity, and waxed fat, and did not rightly e&s;teem the rock of their &s;alvation, but rebelled again&s;t me, and in the time of correction they kicked; neverthele&s;s I did not impute their &s;ins unto you, neither have I numbered them to their children, neither will I, but every man &s;hall &s;uffer for his own &s;in; and he called unto many, and taught them many excellent things, and commanded them to go forth, and publi&s;h this doctrine to all people, whither&s;oever he &s;hould &s;end them; yea even the glad tidings of peace and &s;alvation, to as many as believed on the name of him that &s;ent them, and received his law, and obeyed it, promi&s;ing to be with them henceforth and for ever.</P>
<P N="24">24 And the Lord &s;aid unto me, Behold, I have &s;hewed thee all the&s;e things, that thou mighte&s;t make them known unto the people of this land; for I am determined to do unto this land according to all that thou ha&s;t &s;een; therefore write all the&s;e things in a book, that if any will hear, and under&s;tand, and repent, and be converted, that I may heal them, and &s;ave them from the hour of temptation that is coming on all fle&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>THE EXPLANATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 THIS mountain is the Quaker profe&s;&s;ion, or yearly meet|ing, in Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P N="2">2 Shews the members, under the term of candle&s;ticks, and tho&s;e who were born &s;ons. By candles, and tho&s;e which &s;hined bright, were &s;uch who bore a clear te&s;timony again&s;t the idol di&s;cipline: They had not only oil in their lamps, but lighted al&s;o, and burning bright.</P>
<P N="3">3 As tho&s;e in this ver&s;e, being covered, &s;hews &s;ome, who, in their private opinion, were one with the bright ones; their lamps were al&s;o lighted, but kept under cover, for fear of the yearly meeting authority, and &s;elect party:&mdash;Who&s;e com|mittees, to deal with &s;uch who could not conform to di&s;cipline, were the clouds that carried tho&s;e &s;torms which darkened the light of the Spirit of God in almo&s;t all the members minds; and as &s;ome were overthrown, it &s;hews that &s;ome were over|come by tho&s;e &s;torms, and their faith &s;ailed in the light of Chri&s;t, in their own hearts; and they put their tru&s;t in, and depended upon the wall for &s;ecurity, which was di&s;cipline; being built of, or compo&s;ed of &s;uch laws and rules as was truly the inward law of God's own Spirit; that is, where men truly, by the dictates of God's own Spirit, made con&s;cience of things, and according as they walked, as to outward actions, by the leading of that Spirit;&mdash;this was collected into writing, and made into a law of di&s;cipline; thus was this idol, or wall, in which they tru&s;ted, made of precious &s;tones.</P>
<P N="4">4 But this company, from another country, &s;hews the natural man acting, exactly in all outward appearance, to this law, while yet &s;trangers to the work of conver&s;ion; following the di|rection of this di&s;cipline and orders, &s;en&s;e, judgments and ap|pointments of the meetings of bu&s;ine&s;s, which is <HI>ignus fatus,</HI> for every man and woman that ever acted in any &s;ervice of a religious nature, by virtue of their appointment from a meet|ing, &s;o far as that appointment was their warrant, or motive of inducement, &s;o far they followed <HI>ignus fatus,</HI> who&s;e prime leader to all the inferior meetings, is the authority of the yearly meeting. This authority is the &s;carlet coloured bea&s;t; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;carlet is the kingly colour here in the kingdom of England; and it is to &s;ignify, that it has a &s;hew of kingly or royal au|thority: And as in its very nature it oppre&s;&s;es, which begets defence, &s;o oppre&s;&s;ion and defence is its proper name. (That its very nature is to oppre&s;s, will be &s;hewn at large in a work now preparing for the pre&s;s, wherein the my&s;tery of <HI>Babylon</HI> will

The natural man, thus acting according to the very exact copy of the living world, while yet entire &s;trangers to it, deceived tho&s;e who had once known it, and were darkened again by this great outward &s;hew; &s;o that they went forth from the true living word of God, in their own heart, which was going out of the very profe&s;&s;ion: Omitting ju&s;tice and judg|ment, is al&s;o breaking over the rule, becau&s;e this is the end and de&s;ign; and breaking over the very wall, whole very fir&s;t foundation was laid by the fir&s;t Quakers, not to &s;tir or act but in God's power only; but in&s;tead thereof, their eyes are turned to the leader of this multitude, namely, the orders and autho|rity of the yearly meeting; him they honour, and in that they tru&s;t, and al&s;o rejoice; yea, al&s;o &s;ay, that we will do valiantly, for our God is with us. It is high time to ri&s;e again&s;t the mighty, (has been a common &s;aying in meetings of bu&s;ine&s;s, by the &s;elect party) meaning &s;uch who call the authority of the body of friends in que&s;tion, and the authority of the yearly meeting. Let the di&s;cipline be put in practice, and compare this with the latter part of this ver&s;e; as al&s;o, the yearly col|lections to print epi&s;tles, with private gifts to traveling friends, who are valiant for this cau&s;e; ob&s;erve al&s;o by the way, that though, as hinted in (3), tho&s;e committees were the very clouds, &s;et to work by this authority, which carried or occa|&s;ioned all contention, tempe&s;ts and &s;torms, or &s;trife; yet they them&s;elves a&s;&s;igned the cau&s;e to an oppo&s;ite &s;pirit.&mdash;Having &s;et the reader on the tract or true &s;ent of the meaning of this vi&s;ion, &s;hall now but ju&s;t give a hint of matters in &s;hort, in order to le&s;&s;en the bulk of the book.</P>

Tho&s;e tempe&s;ts here relate to the di&s;courage|ments thrown in the way, as calling us heathens, ranters, &s;e|parati&s;ts; and the works (or u&s;e made of them) of <HI>Barclay's</HI> Anarchy, <HI>Ellwood</HI>'s works, and others, on or touching this point, who had once known the truth. This proves a hard labour, even if it were po&s;&s;ible to deceive the very elect; yet a number has witne&s;&s;ed all this, not &s;o much as able to dim the light for they laboured diligently, and found the pearl of great price, that is, appealed only to the witne&s;s of truth in their own hearts; this is the tower again&s;t the mo&s;t plau&s;ible out|ward appearance.</P>

<P N="7">7 <HI>(a)</HI> This one was the voice of truth in the &s;ons of God, or &s;ons of the free woman, that cried again&s;t this di&s;cipline, que|ries, memorials, &amp;c. <HI>(b)</HI> The wall of this tower, being &s;ure, alludes to the other as not &s;ure: <HI>(c)</HI> This; &s;hews, they tru&s;t to this di&s;cipline, as a things of their own &s;trength; though of pure gold, and precious &s;tones. <HI>(d)</HI> Forgot to &s;et truth and hone&s;ty, and the &s;pirit which trades it, above rule and order. <HI>(e)</HI> Let truth yet remain, under the name of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="8">8 <HI>(a)</HI> This was quite obvious, for the &s;erpent had twi&s;ted him&s;elf, and mixed to &s;uch with the truth, that it was difficult for the &s;ons of God, to &s;trike at this great order and authority, without giving encouragement to a libertine &s;pirit. So when peoples eyes began to be opened, the libertine and vain broke loo&s;e, who were chained down by the remains of the power and function that went with the order and authority of &s;uch who had acted truly in God's power; for this power had in &s;ome mea|&s;ure remained till it was removed by a di&s;covery of the cheat. <HI>(b)</HI> This wild boar a&s;&s;ayed, in its fury, to overrun the pure power and word of life, as well as the fal&s;e, which cau&s;ed the widow and orphan to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; that is, tho&s;e who were motherle&s;s and fatherle&s;s, or for&s;aken of the yearly meeting, namely, the golden ones, who had cried again&s;t order and di&s;|cipline <HI>(a),</HI> or the &s;in of <HI>Onan.</HI></P>

And it is fitting to ob&s;erve here, that God tries the &s;oul, upon the conditions of its covenant, which &s;ometimes will be to prohibit it from lawful things: And among Quakers, we find of late, they are tried with a breach of di&s;cipline, may be to ri&s;e in prayer, in pub|lick, before they are received in unity, by the paper god; as <HI>E&mdash;b A&mdash;b,</HI> and others I could produce.</P>
