TWO things that are diametrically oppo&s;ite to each other, can|not exi&s;t to all eternity; if both are infinite; they will mu|tually de&s;troy each other, if the one be infinite, &amp; the other finite, the finite mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, and which ever is mo&s;t powerful, mu&s;t de&s;troy the other.

<P>Chri&s;tian experience proves the re&s;toration of all things; when a man comes to &s;ee him&s;elf le&s;t &amp; undone, vile in God's fight, un|worthy of his mercy, and totally unable to deliver him&s;elf from his &s;in and mi&s;ery, he is then brought by the power of GOD, to re&s;ign him&s;elf into GOD's hands, without re&s;erve, to do with him according to his will; being convinced that God neither will nor can do him any inju&s;tice, he views him as an holy righteous good and merciful God, he &s;ees that he is undone without a Saviour, Chri&s;t is revealed to him as able and mighty to &s;ave, e|ven to the uttermo&s;t, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;ufficiency in Chri&s;t to &s;ave, not on|ly him the vile&s;t; but the whole world! he &s;ees his love, &s;o rich boundle&s;s &amp; free, and his willingne&s;s to &s;ave all, that he admires and is overcome with the tran&s;porting view, he beholds his love like a river flowing down to him as free as water he knows that altho' he is the mo&s;t unworthy, yet God in his unbounded love &amp; mercy has graciou&s;ly pitied him. I&s;a 55, 1.46.12, 13. Jerem. 31, 3. Mat. 9. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and many more texts are precious to him, be not only hopes for; but feels &amp; knows &s;alvation; he not only prays for him|&s;elf; but prays &amp; longs, that every &s;oul of Adams race might come to know the love &amp; mercy of <HI>God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, infinitely full free and unmerited,</HI> He beholds in Chri&s;t an infinite fulne&s;s, &s;ufficien|cy &amp; willingne&s;s, to &s;ave all without exception! he loves all man|kind, even his enemies, and wi&s;hes that they might come &amp; partake of his grace, and earne&s;tly de&s;ires the &s;alvation of all, and prays for it, as for his own; he could embrace the whole human race in the arms of benevolence, If he had as much power as good will, he would bring all to bow to the &s;cepter of grace, and to become re|conciled to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and obedient to him!</P>

Then let me a&s;k you, can a &s;mall drop be longer than the unfa|thomed abys and ocean of love? Have you more compa&s;&s;ion on your fellow-creatures than God that made them? Can any effect be grea|ter than its cau&s;e? Would you bring all to God and cau&s;e them to be happy if you could? And will not he, to whom nothing that he plea&s;es is impo&s;&s;ible, bring all creatures to be reconciled unto him|&s;elf at la&s;t, and become obedient to him? He has infinitely more love to his creatures, than all the &s;aints and angels have, he is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite power and wi&s;dom, as well as love, all means to accompli&s;h the works are known to him: He can do it in a way that &s;hall cau&s;e his prai&s;e to abound exceedingly, it is his will and purpo&s;e &s;o to do; what then can hinder him from fulfiling it?</P>
<P>Our Lord hath commanded us, Matt. 5, 41&mdash;48.18, 21. Luke 6, 27&mdash;38. to love all mankind, even our enemies, to do good to them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> render good for evil, to forgive them that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us, to pray for them, that we may be the children of our father who is in heaven, who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works: But if he doth not love all him&s;elf and do good to them, and will nev'r for|give them who tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t him, and render them good for e|vil, he hath commanded us to be more perfect in that re&s;pect, than him&s;elf: which to &s;uppo&s;e is highly ab&s;urd. What &s;o all we &s;ay to that doctrine that teaches us, that God hates with a perfect ha|tred many of tho&s;e whom he hath commanded us to love as our&s;elves?</P>
<P>Now is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e with any degree of rea&s;on, that our Lord would command us, upon pain of his highe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, to forgive tho&s;e whom he hated, and determin'd to puni&s;h while he &s;hould exi&s;t, without having the lea&s;t de&s;ire or de&s;ign to do them good? Has he promi&s;ed us the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, if we will forgive all men, and will he never forgive them? He that can believe this, let him believe it.&mdash;Paul exhorts to pray for all men becau&s;e it's God's will, that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, (or re&s;tored) and be|cau&s;e that Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time, and commands, &s;aying, The&s;e things <HI>do</HI> and <HI>teach,</HI> 1 Tim. 2.1-8. and 4, 9 10 11. to pray without doubting. O! what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> word is this! May we, ought we to pray for the &s;alvation of all men without doubting? Surely God would never have com|manded us to do this, unle&s;s it was his &s;ecret purpo&s;e to re&s;tore all men in his own time. The belief of the doctrine of the re&s;toration of all men, doth not in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and to hinder us from loving all, doing good to all, forgiving all men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and pray|ing for all men but rather encourages us &s;o to do, from the con&s;i|deration, that God loves them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> all, and is determined to make them <HI>all,</HI> &s;ubjects of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> kingdom at la&s;t.</P>

This doctrine of the re&s;toration doth not tend to make us hate God, nor doth it tend to produce &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, nor prevent benevo|lence, meekne&s;s, humility, forbearance, forgivene&s;s, charity and all goodne&s;s, it does not tend to produce pride, envy, malice, rage, fury, wrath or madne&s;s again&s;t our neighbours or fellow-creatures, but the contrary <HI>"Glory to GOD in the highe&s;t, and on earth, peace, good will towards men"</HI> It cannot be a licentious doctrine, for the above rea&s;ons, <HI>i. e.</HI> becau&s;e it cau&s;es benevolence, meekne&s;s, humility, forbearance, forgivene&s;s, charity and all goodne&s;s, to abound and increa&s;e, and does not fill our brea&s;ts with &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s or pride, nor cau&s;e our brea&s;ts to &s;well with pale envy and rancarous malice, at the happine&s;s of others. 1 John II, 10.

The mi&s;ery of the wicked &s;hall end, becau&s;e the kingdom of e|vil &s;hall end.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t are his natural &s;ubjects, he is their right|ful &s;overeign: But &s;atan's &s;ubjects are &s;laves, led captive by him at his will, he is an u&s;urper, and all that are in bondage to him belongs to Chri&s;t, who will finally draw them all to him&s;elf.

<P>If the lake of fire or &s;econd death it&s;elf &s;hall be de&s;troyed, &s;hall cea&s;e and be no more; there is an end to tormenting pain, and that it &s;hall be de&s;troyed and be no more, read I&s;a. xxv, 8. Ho&s;. xiii, 14. 1 Cor. xv, 26.55. death the la&s;t enemy &s;hall he de&s;troyed, if this be true, then not one enemy &s;hall be left! it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that altho' the very la&s;t enemy &s;hall be de&s;troyed, yet many mil|lions &s;hall remain to all eternity, read 1 John iii, 8. Unle&s;s Chri&s;t finally de&s;troys the works of the devil, even all &s;in out of the uni|ver&s;e, his purpo&s;e mu&s;t eternally be fru&s;trated. Heb. ii, 14,</P>
<P>As to Judas Chri&s;t promi&s;ed twelve thrones to the twelve apo&s;tles, Matt. xix, 28. and therefore he mu&s;t be re&s;tored, or the promi&s;e can't be fulfiled. And Chri&s;t prayed for his murderers and cruci|fiers &amp;c. As to what Peter &s;ays, Acts i, compared with P&s;. lix 25. St, Paul applies part of &s;aid p&s;alm to the Jews, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> as Peter applies it to Judas: See Romans xi, 9.10. and the whole chapter.</P>
<P>That repentance may find place in hell, &s;ee Wi&s;. v, and Luke xvi, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">8.30, If there was no &s;uch a thing as repentance in hell, or the pri&s;on after death, how came Chri&s;t to preach to the &s;pir|rits in pri&s;on? 1 Pet. iii, 19.20 dit. iv, 6.</P>
<P>It may be que&s;tioned, whether there it not &s;omething in the i|dea of limited, yet certain puni&s;hment, &s;o ju&s;t equitable, rea&s;ona|ble, and evident, that is more calculated to produce belief, and con|&s;equently more effectual to de&s;troy fal&s;e hopes of e&s;caping it, and al&s;o to check that daring pre&s;umption, which ri&s;es out of the idea of <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery,</HI> than can be found in the contrary doctrine. End|le&s;s puni&s;hment &s;eems to &s;hock tender minds, at lea&s;t numbers have no better excu&s;e for finning greedily than this, that there is no hopes of there being &s;aved, therefore they are determined to &s;in on, &s;ince it can make no difference.</P>
<P>Though damnation has been commonly under&s;tood for many a|ges, and has been preached as &s;uch, yet it has not prevented evil
<PB N="7" REF="025210_0008_0FCCA5246FF15890">at all, or very little: Tho&s;e people that believe in the univer&s;al re|&s;toration live &s;tricter: than others who don't, in general: The german Bapti&s;ts all believe it, yet no people live &s;tricter or more moral than they do, and many hundreds be&s;ides them, yet it don't tend to make them licentious. Endle&s;s damnation is too unnatu|ral to be believed; but limited puni&s;hment being more rea&s;onable &s;eems more certain. Certain it is, that where the idea of endle&s;s mi&s;ery prevails, it doth not prevent iniquity in the mea&s;ure that might be expected, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of its being the truth of God. The great number of heathens, who die without ever be|ing favoured with the written go&s;pel, or ever of hearing of end|le&s;s mi&s;ery; the many that die in their infancy and childhood, toge|ther with the in&s;tances of ideots, and per&s;ons born deaf; all convince me more than any logical arguments, that God has many ways of in&s;tructing and reclaiming his creatures in another &s;tate, than we are acquainted with. It is not &s;o much the intention of God, me|rely to re&s;train &s;in, as to &s;how in all it's dreadful deformity, puni&s;h it according to it's de&s;erts, and finally &s;how the &s;uperabounding of his grace, in overcoming and totally de&s;troying it out of his crea|tion; which &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, when he that &s;itteth upon the throne &s;hall make all things new, and there &s;hall be no more death, neither &s;orrow, nor crying, neither &s;hall there be any more pain, for the former things are pa&s;&s;ed away, Rev. <HI>xxi,</HI> 4.</P>
<P>I don't wonder that univer&s;al re&s;toration is not admitted by the generality of learned preachers; for how wou'd it affect their preaching? for in&s;tance, would it not mar a modern &s;ermon, the &s;oul and e&s;&s;ence of which is &mdash; damnation &mdash; eternal damnation &mdash; the everla&s;ting torments of hell, &amp;c. &amp;c. expre&s;&s;ions of wonder|ful force and pathos, and that admit of a very convenient variety of change. Univer&s;al re&s;toration gaining ground, what would be|come of pulpit rhetoric, &s;o enobled as it has been by fire and flame, for ever more? by this craft, &s;aid &s;ome of old: we have our wealth, and with as &s;trong a jealou&s;y, might others then cry out, &mdash; nay, &s;poil us not; for this is the &s;ecret fund, out of which we make up all deficiencies and fill up every cha&s;m.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the re&s;toration of all things, is no new doctrine; many have wrote upon it, hundreds have preached it, and thou|&s;ands have believed it, &s;ince the reformation. The truth of this ble&s;&s;ed doctrine was well known to the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, and to the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, was by the apo&s;tles and fir&s;t Chri&s;tians declared, and handed down to &s;ucceeding generations, and &s;ome of the fathers, (as they are called) as Origen &amp;c. who&s;e writing have been pre|&s;erved, were open witne&s;&s;es for it, and indeed it hath had witne&s;&s;es in all ages, down to the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="025210_0009_0FCCA525EF4B3168">
Many preachers in our days believe it, although they preach of endle&s;s damnation: For as long as they want to belong to the &s;y|nod, or council of learned mini&s;ters, or prie&s;ts, or &s;anhedrims, they mu&s;t conform to the rules and canons of their particular &s;ect, or corporation, which rules canons, traditions of their elders, or doc|trines of men, to them are more &s;acred, than the writings of the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t; for the &s;criptures they may turn, twi&s;t, ob&s;erve &s;ome, reject other parts of them, di&s;obey &s;ome &s;cripture commands, alter others &amp;c. but the rights, rules, ordinances and commands laid down in their &s;ymbolical and canonical books, mu&s;t be punctually ob&s;erved and kept, if &s;ome of the doctrines therein contained, &s;hould even be found to be diametrically oppo&s;ie to Chri&s;t's doc|trine. And as univer&s;al re&s;titution is contrary to their &s;y&s;tem, they dare not utter it, for fear of man's di&s;plea&s;ure; on the con|trary, as endle&s;s damnation compo&s;es a part of their &s;y&s;tem, they mu&s;t preach it up, or be in danger of being anathematized, by their brethern in black, i. e. the tribe of Rubies, and then be cur|tailed of their titles of honour, greetings in the markets, chief &s;eats in &s;ynagogues, uppermo&s;t rooms in fea&s;ts, of fine clothings, great yearly &s;allaries, gaudy trappings and furniture; and perhaps become as poor as one of the apo&s;tles of our Lord Je&s;us, when they &s;ojourned on this earthly ball, or as Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who had not any thing to lay his head upon, much le&s;s fine hou&s;es, lands &amp;c. But if there be a <HI>Heretick in the world,</HI> it is the man who for the love of money or applau&s;e, or through the fear of man preaches that to others which he him&s;elf doth not believe.&mdash;He that is &s;uch is &s;ubverted, and &s;inneth being condemned of him&s;elf, Tit. iii, 11.</P>

<P>As Chri&s;t is alpha, &s;o he will be omega; as he was the begin|ning, &s;o he will be the ending; as he is the fir&s;t, &s;o &s;hall he be the la&s;t: He will outlive all &s;in enmity and evil, and totally a|boli&s;h and de&s;troy the works of &s;atan, and the kingdom of &s;atan: He will exi&s;t an endle&s;s duration, when &s;in, enmity, and evil of e|very kind are no more!</P>
<P>Paul &s;ays: that God is the &s;aviour of all men, and commands Timothy, &s;aying: the&s;e things command and teach, 1 Tim. iv, 10.11. but our modern preachers contradict Paul, and make him a liar, for they &s;ay, i. e. God or Chri&s;t &s;aves only a &s;mall number, and that &s;atans kingdom &s;hall remain to all eternity, and that he will have ab&s;olute dominion over them, and torment and puni&s;h many millions of &s;ouls, that God made unto endle&s;s duration: At that rate Chri&s;t has not power &s;ufficient to conquer &s;atan his enemy, nor to de&s;troy his works, although &s;cripture informs us that he both has, and will make his enemies his foot&s;tool, and bring all things in &s;ubjection under him, and will reconcile all to him&s;elf, and that he is the head of all principality and power. <HI>O ye blind, guides! ye defenders of &s;atans kingdom! how amazed you will be, when the time of the general re&s;toration comes.</HI></P>
<P>Every per&s;on, who by rea&s;on of &s;in and rebellion again&s;t God, that will be ca&s;t into the lake of fire, will continue for a time there|in, and be &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed for the &s;ame: But will then be re|&s;tored by Chri&s;t, as &s;oon as they have undergone their puni&s;hment. I &s;hould imagine, that if a poor damned per&s;on, &s;hould only be a few thou&s;and years in the lake of fire and brim&s;tone, [as the unbe|lievers in Noah's time, till Chri&s;t preached to them) it would be a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment for their wickedne&s;s committed in their &s;hort lives of forty, fifty, or one hundred years, though I don't &s;up|po&s;e their pain will end as &s;oon; but may perhaps may la&s;t many thou&s;and years, and after they are re&s;tored, they will not po&s;&s;e&s;s as great a degree of happine&s;s, as the elect, who have followed the Lamb, in the regeneration in their life, and pre&s;erved therein un|to the end.</P>

That the fallen angels, as well as all mankind, will, by the judge of the quick and dead, be judged according to their works, and re|ceive their reward, according to their de&s;ert or deeds, I believe; but that is not again&s;t the re&s;toration of all things. No creature can in &s;uch a &s;hort time, or a time that &s;hall have an end, com|mit as much evil, as to de&s;erve endle&s;s puni&s;hment in a lake of flaming fire, for there is no proportion, or likene&s;s between endle&s;s duration, and a time to end, and e&s;pecially between the &s;hort life of a man in this world, and endle&s;s duration: And I &s;hould think that the damned, would be &s;ufficiently tormented, and pay dear enough, for all their evil deeds, that they done in their thirty, forty or fifty years; if they &s;hould remain but thirty forty or fifty thou&s;and years in hell, for one day's puni&s;hment in hell, would &s;eem longer and &s;everer, than many years in this world, even on a bed of &s;ickne&s;s, God is as good as he is ju&s;t, and will not give any of the damned one &s;ingle &s;troke more than they de|&s;erve; but rather le&s;s, as he is a God of love, mercy and pity, and after all and every one hath received their puni&s;hment, for their evil deeds, they will certainly be &s;et free out of pri&s;on, and out of pain, redeemed through Chri&s;t, and made happy, both men and fallen angels. There is no &s;uch words in all the &s;criptures, as endle&s;s death, endle&s;s damnation, endle&s;s de&s;ire or will of &s;in|ning. There is no proportion between an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, and &s;ins or crimes of forty fifty &s;ixty or &s;eventy or one hundred years committing: A man of common &s;en&s;e would rather &s;uffer the greate&s;t tribulations and angui&s;h during a life of &s;ixty or &s;e|venty or eighty years in this world, in order to enter into imme|diate happine&s;s after death: than live a life of great plea&s;ure here, and be afterwards tormented in fire and brim&s;tone, if his torments &s;hould continue but a few thou&s;and years: He mu&s;t be right foo|li&s;h or mad, that would rather live here in plea&s;ure fifty &s;ixty or eighty years, and be tormented in hell, if it were but a few thou|&s;and years: than live a godly life, and after death enter into end|le&s;s glory.</P>
<P>It is contrary to &s;ound rea&s;on, to &s;uppo&s;e that an allmighty, all|wi&s;e allknowing good, and merciful God, &s;hould have created ma|ny mi&s;&s;ions of &s;ouls to be tormented in a lake of fire, without end, as well as it is contrary to &s;cripture. Or that he &s;hould puni&s;h them &s;o long, for the crimes committed in a few years. See I&s;a. lxv 7. lxvi 22. compared with 2 Peter iii, 10.11.12.13. Rev. xxi, 1. concerning the creation of new heavens and new earth, and the earth being di&s;olved with fire.</P>
<P>The re&s;toration of all things, after the conflagration, will be
<PB N="11" REF="025210_0012_0FCCA52B8FB95848">gradual, but the earth will be fir&s;t re&s;tored, at lea&s;t a con&s;iderable part of it, for as we read of the lake of fire burning with brim&s;tone into which the bea&s;t and fal&s;e prophet were ca&s;t alive, before or at the beginning of the millennium, and the devil him&s;elf at the end of it, before the &s;econd re&s;urrection and the judgement, which lake of fire and brim&s;tone was doubtle&s;s in a part of the earth, before the conflagration turned the whole into an univer&s;al lake of the &s;ame kind, &s;o a principal part of the earth may be re|newed, and yet a part may continue as a place of torment, long after the de&s;cent of the holy city. But the new creation of the earth and its &s;urrounding atmo&s;phere, together with the de&s;cent of the holy city from God out of heaven, cannot be for their &s;akes who will have dwelt therein for ages before, and who &s;hall go no more out; but for the &s;ake of tho&s;e unhappy beings, who being ca&s;t into the lake of fire, experienced the amazing torments of the &s;econd death. If God had de&s;igned to leave all tho&s;e who &s;hall re|main on the earth, and peri&s;h in the general conflagration or lake of fire and brim&s;tone, to continue in that mi&s;erable &s;tate to all e|ternity, we &s;hould never have heard of the earth being created a|new, by the power of God, nor of the holy city de&s;cending from God out of heaven: But as Jehova, hath purpo&s;ed to create all men anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in the ages to come, and in the di&s;pen&s;a|tion of the fulne&s;s of times, to rehead or rally all things which now are &s;cattered under one leader, therefore he will renew the earth, and make it the &s;cene, or &s;tage, whereon the&s;e mo&s;t amazing wonders &s;hall be performed. God will look down from heaven, upon the earth in it's melted &s;tate, as he did formerly upon it, when it was overwhelmed with waters, or as a &s;kilful founder watches the &s;tate of the melted metal in his furnace, and knows exactly when to begin his operations, &s;o the great &s;upreme in his appointed time, &s;eeing that the great fire hath di&s;&s;olved the earth, and thereby hath brought it to a proper &s;tate for him to manife&s;t his creating power upon, and al&s;o, that a con&s;iderable number of the &s;ufferers are humbled, and prepared for him to manife&s;t his redeeming power, love and grace, in and upon; he will than without delay begin to put his gracious de&s;igns into execution, by fir&s;t renewing a habi|tation for them, and then renewing them to dwell therein: than will he cau&s;e his holy city to de&s;cend from God out of heaven, to make a long continuance with men. In this glorious city, Chri&s;t and his &s;aints &s;hall reign for ages and ages, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> things &s;hall be gradually &s;ubdued, and re&s;tored: then, and not till then, will Chri&s;t deliver up the kingdom to the father, that God may be all in all, beyond which clo&s;eing &s;cene of the mediator's kingdom, the &s;crip|tures do not carry us.</P>
