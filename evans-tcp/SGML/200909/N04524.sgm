<P>WHAT prevailed on me to con&s;ent to the publi&s;hing of the following Letter, was a &s;incere and firm Per|&s;ua&s;ion, that it is really the Cau&s;e of GOD and his CHRIST that I here plead, and that the eternal Intere&s;t of the Souls of Men is very nearly concerned in it. For it is manife&s;t to me, that &s;ome Notions have of late been propagated and inculcated in this Country, that are equally de&s;tructive to the right Belief both of GOD and the Go&s;pel. I have indeed that Charity for tho&s;e that have done it, that I do not believe they are at all &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e fatal Con&s;equences of what they teach, tho' I very much wonder they are not aware of them.</P>
<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible that the odious Name of <HI>Arminiani&s;m</HI> will be the Cry again&s;t the&s;e Papers, from tho&s;e little Minds that are affected with Sounds more than Sen&s;e, and that are engaged at any Rate to &s;upport a Party, without &s;eri|ou&s;ly and impartially attending to the Truth and Right of the Ca&s;e. But I do hereby declare, that I abhor all &s;uch Party Names and Di&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="5 letters">ns, and that <HI>I will call no Man Ma&s;ter upon Earth, for one is my Ma&s;ter in Heaven.</HI> The only Que&s;tion worth attending to, is, not what <HI>Calvin</HI> or what <HI>Arminius</HI> taught, but what CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles taught? for He alone was <HI>the Author and Fi|ni&s;her of our Faith.</HI> And, (all <HI>Metaphy&s;ics</HI> and Words without any Meaning, being &s;et a&s;ide, which have nothing to do in the pre&s;ent Subject,) I humbly &s;ubmit it to every one's Candor and unbya&s;&s;ed Con&s;ideration, whether what follows
<PB N="ii" REF="005614_0004_102691B61F005B08">
be not truly the Doctrine of Chri&s;t: The Sub&s;tance of which may be briefly expre&s;&s;ed in the following Manner, and in the very Language of the Holy Gho&s;t <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>That GOD really means as he &s;ays, when he &s;ays and &s;wears by him&s;elf, That he hath no plea&s;ure in the Death of him that dieth:&mdash;That he is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to Repentance and be &s;aved:&mdash;And that he hath given his Son a Ran&s;om for all, who accordingly hath ta&s;ted Death for every Man, and was a Propotiation for the Sins of the whole World:&mdash; So that who&s;oever will may now come and take of the Waters of Life freely.&mdash; And becau&s;e of our Inability to help our &s;elves, GOD hath by his ble&s;&s;ed Son, a&s;&s;ured us that he will, for his &s;ake, give his Holy Spirit to every one that &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;ks him, and earne&s;tly &s;trives to work out his Salvation with Fear and Trembling, in whom he works by his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit both to will and to do:&mdash;And that he will through his free Grace in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly pardon every true Penitent, accept of every &s;in|cere Believer, and eternally reward all tho&s;e that in the way of well doing, or in a &s;tedfa&s;t Cour&s;e of &s;incere and univer&s;al Obedience to the Go&s;pel, are faithful unto the Death.</Q>&mdash; This is the true Doctrine of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and this is all that I was concerned to defend in the fol|lowing Letter.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UPON a more mature Con&s;ideration of what you, not long &s;ince, &s;ugge&s;ted to me concer|ning the <HI>Divine Sovereignty,</HI> together with what you added upon that Occa&s;ion, relating to the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of the Go&s;pel; I beg leave to write a few Lines to you upon this Subject; nothing captious or di&s;putacious, I a&s;&s;ure you, but with that &s;erious, calm and impartial State of Mind that becomes a Chri&s;tian, who is above all Things de&s;irous to know the Truth, in order that he may be governed by it in the pur&s;uit of everla&s;ting Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>You may remember, it was your chief Inquiry, as a Te&s;t of my being a true Chri&s;tian;&mdash;<HI>Can you in Sincerity &s;ub&s;cribe to the Truth of OUR Doctrine?</HI> By which you meant the Doctrine of the Divine Sovereignty, as you had explain'd it: <HI>i. e.</HI> (if I under&s;tood you right,) as implying God's eternal, arbitrary and ab&s;olute Determi|nation of the everla&s;ting Fate of his Creatures, from his own meer Motion, and without any Con&s;ideration of their good or ill Behaviour. To which, I mu&s;t &s;till an&s;wer; No, <HI>good Sir,</HI> by no means! For the &s;ake of
<PB N="2" REF="005614_0006_1026B073612E81C0">
the Love of God I cannot!&mdash;The <HI>Love of Chri&s;t it &s;elf con&s;traineth me</HI> that I cannot!&mdash;For it manife&s;tly appears to me infinitely impo&s;&s;ible to be true, as being utterly contrary to the <HI>Divine Attributes;</HI> contrary to many <HI>plain Texts</HI> of <HI>Holy Scripture,</HI> and contrary to the general Drift and De&s;ign of the <HI>whole Word of God.</HI></P>
<P>It is contrary to the Nature and Attributes of God, becau&s;e it appears plainly incon&s;i&s;tent with the very Notion of his being a Moral Governour of the World: For it repre&s;ents Him as laying his Creatures under a Nece&s;&s;ity of being what they are, whether good or bad, and &s;o leaves no Room for either Virtue or Vice, Prai&s;e or Blame, Reward or Puni&s;hment, properly &s;peak|ing. &mdash;Nay, it implies a formed De&s;ign of laying, by far the greate&s;t Number of his Creatures, under a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of being eternally mi&s;erable, antecedent to any Con&s;ideration of their Demerit: And this, as it is ex|plained by &s;ome, from a mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h View of promoting his own Glory, at the Expence of their endle&s;s and una|voidable Mi&s;ery; and in effect, of nece&s;&s;itating their be|ing &s;inful that they might be mi&s;erable; for he that wills the End, mu&s;t will the Means; and this implies the mo&s;t &s;hocking Reflexions imaginable on the Wi&s;|dom, Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s of God, all at once; and no le&s;s &s;evere Reflections upon his Truth; for it imports a manife&s;t Double Dealing with them; a &s;ecret Will incon&s;i&s;tent with what he has clearly re|vealed; &s;ince he has declared, and that with an Oath, that he earne&s;tly de&s;ires their Happine&s;s, when at the &s;ame Time he &s;ecretly de&s;igns their inevitable Ruin.</P>
<P>This Doctrine al&s;o appears to be evidently contrary to a great many plain Texts of Holy Scripture, which a&s;&s;ure us in the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Terms, That <HI>GOD is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to Repentance. That He would have all Men to be
<PB N="3" REF="005614_0007_1026B0A7B3EA0A00">
&s;aved, and</HI> that for this End <HI>he &s;ent his Son into the World, who ta&s;ted Death for every Man,</HI> and <HI>became a Propitia|tion for the Sins of the whole World,</HI> and <HI>gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for all;</HI> nay, even for tho&s;e that <HI>by denying the Lord that bought them, bring upon them&s;elves &s;wift De&s;truc|tion.</HI> Ezek. 18.29, 32. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.9. and 2.1. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.4, 6. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.9. 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 2.2. <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, it &s;eems manife&s;tly repugnant to the gene|ral Drift of the whole Word of God, (which is plainly to excite our utmo&s;t Activity in the pur&s;uit of all Holi|ne&s;s in Heart and Life,) there being nothing that can &s;o effectually tend not only to tempt us to entertain hard and unworthy Thoughts of God, but al&s;o to cut the Si|news of all our Endeavours to repent and return to Him and our Duty, as even the mo&s;t di&s;tant Surmize, that po&s;&s;ibly all our Labour may be in vain; &s;ince, for ought we know, we may be ab&s;olutely excluded from all po&s;&s;i|bility of &s;ucceeding by a &s;overeign and inexorable De|cree of Reprobation.</P>
<P>Whereas on the contrary, nothing can &s;o effectually tend to put us upon the mo&s;t vigourous Exertion of our &s;elves in endeavouring to be <HI>Holy as God is Holy, Righte|ous as He is Righteous, and Merciful as He our Heavenly Father is Merciful,</HI> as tho&s;e mo&s;t amiable Apprehen&s;ions of him, which repre&s;ent him as being, in and through his ble&s;&s;ed Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, an univer&s;al and irre&s;pec|tive Lover of the <HI>Souls which he hath made,</HI> and &s;incerely and &s;olicitou&s;ly de&s;irous of their Happine&s;s, in proportion to their &s;everal Capacities, for Chri&s;t's Sake, <HI>without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons,</HI> to grant them all the Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary thereunto, &s;o far as can con&s;i&s;t with his treating them as being what they are, and what he him&s;elf hath made them, <HI>i. e.</HI> tho' frail, yet free, &s;elf exerting and &s;elf-determining Agents; and to make all the tender and merciful Allowances for their Frailty that can con&s;i&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="005614_0008_1026B0797167C420">
with the &s;incerity of their Obedience, and his Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Authority in the Government of the World.&mdash; And this, I think, is manife&s;tly the Idea or Conception of God, which, (agreably to the Light of Nature,) the Holy Scriptures univer&s;ally give us concerning Him.</P>
<P>On which Account if their be any Difficulties from either Rea&s;on or Scripture, (as to me there appear none, but what by attentive Con&s;ideration may be ea&s;ily &s;ur|mounted.) yet methinks we &s;hould be &s;trongly inclined, for God's &s;ake as well as our own, to get over them; and whatever ob&s;cure Texts there may be that may &s;eem to carry a different Sound, to interpret them, (as in fact the Church of God always did in the fir&s;t and pure&s;t Ages; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr, <HI>Whitby</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e on the&s;e Subjects, pa&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> and as we do now,) in a Manner con&s;i&s;tent with the Divine Attributes, and tho&s;e many plain Texts that are intirely con&s;onant to them, and the general Drift of the whole Word of God; being well a&s;&s;ured that what|ever be the Meaning of tho&s;e few ob&s;cure Texts, they cannot po&s;&s;ibly mean any thing contrary either to the Light of Nature, or any other Texts of Scripture, or that can tend to di&s;courage or di&s;hearten our utmo&s;t En|deavours to &s;eek and pur&s;ue the everla&s;ting Happine&s;s of our Souls.&mdash;</P>
<P>In this Manner I am obliged to think upon this great and important Subject.&mdash;But you told me if I could not think with you about the Divine Sovereignty, <Q>I need go no further in my Inquiry, there already appears upon me a black Mark, and my Spot is not the Spot of God's Children.</Q>&mdash;Nay, you did, in effect, tell me, It <HI>is impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for me under this mi&s;take, <Q>to be a Sub|ject of God's &s;pecial Grace here, or Glory hereafter.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See a late Sermon on <HI>Exod. 33.19.</HI> pag. <HI>33.19.</HI></NOTE> Now this is indeed dreadful! and it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid,

<HI>This is a hard &s;aying, who can receive it?</HI>&mdash;I be&s;eech you, <HI>Sir,</HI> can this be right, to pa&s;s &s;uch bitter Cen&s;ures upon every one that cannot think preci&s;ely with you in &s;ome &s;peculative Points, tho' they agree with you both in Heart and Life, in the great practical Matters wherein the Life of all Religion con&s;i&s;ts?&mdash;Is this, can this be con&s;i&s;tent with the Spirit of the Go&s;pel thus to judge one another, and to propagate a Spirit of judging at &s;uch a prodigious Rate?&mdash; Can any thing be more contrary to Chri&s;t's Rule, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.1. <HI>Judge not that ye be not judged,</HI> and to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s whole 14th to the <HI>Romans,</HI> particularly v. 4. <HI>Who art thou that judge&s;t another Man's Servant? to his own Ma&s;ter he &s;tandeth or falleth.</HI> And what can this be le&s;s than a direct Inva&s;ion of his Pro|vince, who claims to him&s;elf alone the Prerogative of <HI>knowing</HI> and <HI>&s;earching the Hearts and trying the Reins of the Children of Men?</HI>&mdash;I do &s;incerely profe&s;s, that after the utmo&s;t Inten&s;ene&s;s of Thought and the mo&s;t &s;olici|tous Care not to be mi&s;led in my Apprehen&s;ions, I am &s;till under the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of thinking as I do upon the&s;e Points, as I am in being per&s;uaded that I &s;ee the Sun when I look full upon it on the Meridian in a clear Day: And that I can no more yield my A&s;&s;ent to &s;ome Points of your Doctrine than to this Propo&s;ition, that 2 and 2 are equal to 5.&mdash;And yet I would by no means cen&s;ure you as you cen&s;ure me; I will not &s;uffer my &s;elt to imagine but that your Mi&s;takes, (great as I apprehend them,) may con&s;i&s;t with your being a &s;erious Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me, whether <HI>I have a clear Sen&s;e of the Di|vine Sovereignty in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our &s;piritual and eternal Salvation?</HI>&mdash;To which I an&s;wer, I tru&s;t I have:&mdash;But then I mu&s;t confe&s;s my Notion is widely different from yours.&mdash;And in order to think clearly on this Subject, and to give a ju&s;t Solution to what Difficulties may &s;eem to ari&s;e from the Text you mentioned, or any other
<PB N="6" REF="005614_0010_1026B07D29DAD030">
Texts relating to this Matter, it &s;eems to me very ne|ce&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Con&s;ideration of GOD as a <HI>Benefactor</HI> and as a <HI>Judge;</HI> and between the Be|&s;towment of various Talents and Favours upon Men in this Life, which is a State of Probation, and the Retri|butions to be awarded in the Life to come, according to what U&s;e they &s;hall have made of them here.&mdash;In the one God acts as a <HI>Sovereign Lord</HI> of his Favours, and in the other as a <HI>Righteous Judge</HI> of the Behaviour of his Creatures under them.&mdash;</P>
<P>I agree, then, that God is intirely &s;overeign and arbi|trary as a <HI>Benefactor</HI> in the Di&s;tribution of his Talents and Favours, both &s;piritual and temporal, as proper Means of Trial and Probation in this World: <HI>i. e.</HI> the various Abilities, Capacities, Privileges and Advantages He be&s;toweth upon Mankind: And he is intirely at <HI>Liberty to do what he will with his own;</HI> and con&s;equent|ly to be&s;tow, not only the good Things of this Life, but eternal Life and Salvation upon his Creatures in what Manner and Mea&s;ure, and upon what Terms He thinks fit; nor is he obliged to give any Account to any one of his Proceedings. But we may always and in all Ca&s;es re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of this, that <HI>the Judge of all the Earth will do</HI> nothing but <HI>what is right;</HI> and that tho' <HI>Clouds and Darkne&s;s are round about Him,</HI> with regard to many of his Di&s;pen&s;ations here, yet <HI>Ju&s;tice and Judgment</HI> are al|ways <HI>the Habitation of his Throne.</HI> P&s;. 97.2.&mdash;Not that Things are therefore right meerly becau&s;e he does them, but He therefore does them becau&s;e they are right.</P>
<P>Indeed I cannot think it con&s;i&s;tent with the Divine Attributes, God's Wi&s;dom, Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to give Being to any of his Intelligent Creatures, without putting them into a Condition, that, (every thing being con&s;idered in the whole of their Nature and
<PB N="7" REF="005614_0011_1026B0AC4A6EF5A0">
Duration,) would render Being de&s;irable to them; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Wolla&s;ton</HI>'s Religion of Nature, p. <HI>200.</HI></NOTE> nor to put them eternally into a Condition that is <HI>wor&s;e than not to be,</HI> but for their own per&s;onal Fault or voluntary Mi&s;conduct in Oppo&s;ition to his Will: And if you will weigh Things exactly, I believe you will find your &s;elf obliged to think with me in this Matter; unle&s;s you will go into tho&s;e two mon&s;trou&s;ly ab&s;urd Conclu&s;ions to which Dr. <HI>Twi&s;&s;e</HI> is reduced, and which he is obliged to maintain as being the Foundations of the whole ab&s;olute Sy&s;tem, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>it is better to be eternally mi&s;erable, than not to be;</HI> and con&s;equently, <HI>That it may con&s;i&s;t with the Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s of God, to inflict exqui&s;ite and eter|nal Mi&s;ery upon innocent Creatures:</HI> i. e. <HI>upon &s;uch as were never capable of formal or actual Sin.</HI>&mdash;See his <HI>Vindiciae Gratioe,</HI> Lib. 2. p. 16. <HI>De Ami&s;. Grat. Digr.</HI> 1.&mdash;Such are the hopeful Principles on which that fatal Doctrine is founded!&mdash;But in truth, methinks I would not wi&s;h any Cau&s;e more effectually baffled, than to &s;ee it reduced to &s;uch prodigious Ab&s;urdities as the&s;e are.</P>
<P>For tho' God is not accountable to his Creatures for any of his Proceedings, yet we mu&s;t conceive, that his own infinite Wi&s;dom, Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s mu&s;t be a Law to Him from which he cannot vary.&mdash; And as I cannot think it con&s;i&s;tent with either of them to lay any of his Creatures, (antecedent to any Con&s;ide|ration of their Behaviour,) under an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of being eventually and irretrievably mi&s;erable; &s;o I mu&s;t do Him that Honour as to think, they do oblige Him, in giving them Being, to put them into a Condition that is in the whole better than not to be, and by no means to put them into a wor&s;e Condition than not to be, but in Ca&s;e of their own wilful Di&s;obedience and final Impeni|tency: For if you think otherwi&s;e, you mu&s;t, in effect,
<PB N="8" REF="005614_0012_1026B07ECFF29888">
&s;uppo&s;e him to will Mi&s;ery meerly for Mi&s;ery's &s;ake!&mdash; A Thought &s;o &s;hocking and horrid, that it mu&s;t be forever removed at an infinite Di&s;tance from that greate&s;t and be&s;t of Beings!&mdash;But every thing beyond what is ju&s;t &s;ufficient to render Being de&s;ireable, even to a perfect Creature, however &s;o obedient, I take to be Matter of meer &s;overeign Goodne&s;s, in which God may go into what variety He plea&s;es: Much more mu&s;t the whole Sy&s;tem of the Go&s;pel to fallen Man be Matter of meer &s;overeign free Grace; and con&s;e|quently, in this Di&s;pen&s;ation of his free Grace in Chri&s;t to Mankind, <HI>He hath Mercy</HI> and <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion on whom,</HI> in what Manner and Mea&s;ure, and upon what Terms he &s;ees fit. And none can rea&s;onably complain, &s;o long as his Condition is better than not to be, and it will be intirely his own Fault if he be not in &s;ome Degree happy; and &s;ince he &s;hall not be accountable for what he never received, and &s;hall be treated according to his Conduct in the u&s;e of the Talent that was committed to his Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>GOD is therefore confe&s;&s;edly &s;overeign and arbitrary in the various Di&s;tributions of his Talents and Favours to his Creatures, and the &s;everal Conditions in which he places them, as proper Means and Occa&s;ions of Proba|tion.&mdash;It is from his meer &s;overeign good Plea&s;ure that he allots to one Creature the Nature and Condition of a Man, to another that of an Angel;&mdash;to one Man a healthy, to another a &s;ickly Con&s;titution:&mdash;To one Poverty, to another Riches;&mdash;to one &s;mall Abilities and mean Advantages, to another large Powers and great Opportunities for Learning and Improvement:&mdash; To one Man or Number of Men, <HI>One Talent,</HI> viz. the <HI>Light of Nature;</HI> to another <HI>two Talents,</HI> viz. <HI>Judai&s;m;</HI> to another <HI>five,</HI> viz. <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI>&mdash;In the&s;e and the like various Di&s;tributions of Favours, Talents and Circum|&s;tances
<PB N="9" REF="005614_0013_1026B0ADD937D750">
in this State of Probation, I grant God's Decrees and Allotments are ab&s;olute and per&s;onal as well as na|tional.&mdash;But this is but a temporary and probationary State; whereas in the State of Retribution after this Life, the Condition of Men will be decided for all Eternity, and this, not according to any ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;ition he has already made; not according to what they have received here, but according to what U&s;e and Improve|ment they &s;hall have made of what they had received; as is plain from many of our Saviour's Parables and Di&s;cour&s;es, and particularly tho&s;e of the 25th of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> as well as many other Texts, and indeed from the whole Bible.&mdash;It is therefore manife&s;t, that with regard to the future State of our Being, a &s;overeign and ab&s;olute Deci&s;ion cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to take Place; and that God's Decrees with regard to that State can imply nothing el&s;e but his Re&s;olution to treat all Men accord|ing to the U&s;e they &s;hall have made of his &s;everal Allotments to them in this World: <HI>i. e.</HI> To render the Good Happy and the Wicked Mi&s;erable; in various Proportions, according to their Behaviour.&mdash;</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it &s;eems to me, that the right Way of forming a ju&s;t Notion of God's Decrees, is, to judge of them by the Facts as they really are before our Eyes. No Man is in fact laid under an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of being &s;inful and mi&s;erable in the whole and Re&s;ult of Things; therefore He never decreed ab&s;olutely that he &s;hould be &s;o: &mdash; And God has in fact, a&s;&s;ured us, that none &s;hall be mi&s;erable at la&s;t but for their own Fault; it mu&s;t therefore be his Decree, that tho&s;e that are mi&s;erable at la&s;t &s;hall be &s;o only for their own inex|cu&s;able Wickedne&s;s. As <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the righte|ous &s;hall be upon him, &s;o the Wickedne&s;s of the wicked &s;hall be upon him.</HI> Ezek. 18.20.&mdash;There are in fact a great variety of Talents and Privileges be&s;towed on

Mankind; therefore God, is the &s;overeign Lord of his Favours, decreed there &s;hould be &s;uch a variety;&mdash; and he has in fact declared that Good Men, <HI>i. e.</HI> tho&s;e that make a good u&s;e of them will be happy, and the &s;lothful, the wicked and impenitent will be mi&s;erable according to the Sentence which he will pa&s;s upon them as the righteous Judge of their Conduct and Behaviour: He therefore decreed that this &s;hould be the Re&s;ult of things, <HI>viz.</HI> That the righteous &s;hould be happy and the wicked mi&s;erable.&mdash;This is all the Notion that I can have of the Decrees of God: And as I am per&s;ua|ded this is the true Sen&s;e of the Holy Scriptures, taken in the whole, and critically read and con&s;idered, and with which every particular Text that may &s;eem to &s;ound otherwi&s;e, may ea&s;ily be reconciled; &s;o I can't but think that whatever objections may &s;eem to lie again&s;t it from the Fore-knowledge of God, will be &s;ound to ari&s;e only from the narrowne&s;s of our own way of con|ceiving things, and to con&s;i&s;t meerly in <HI>darkning Coun|cel by Words without Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>For &s;trictly and philo&s;ophically &s;peaking, there can be no more Propriety in attributing <HI>Pre&s;cience</HI> or Fore|knowledge to God, than in attributing <HI>Repentance</HI> to him; becau&s;e there is neither <HI>pa&s;t</HI> nor <HI>to come,</HI> neither <HI>fore</HI> nor <HI>after</HI> in him; for the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions imply Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, which implies Limitation, which cannot be in an infinitely perfect and immutable Being. So that ac|cording to philo&s;ophic Verity, they cannot any otherwi&s;e be a&s;cribed to God than <HI>Repenting, Grieving, Eyes, Ears, Hands</HI> and other bodily Parts and Pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;We are therefore to conceive all the&s;e and the like Expre&s;&s;ions which are u&s;ed in the Holy Scriptures, as being, (what they are commonly called,) God's &s;peaking of him&s;elf after the manner of Men; and con&s;equently that God's <HI>Foreknowing</HI> and <HI>prede&s;tinating</HI> are Terms that are u&s;ed,

(like his <HI>Repenting,</HI>) meerly figuratively and by way of Accommodation to our weak Capacities and our low way of apprehending and conceiving divine Things; and are to be explained after the &s;ame Manner, <HI>viz.</HI> That as God's <HI>Repenting, (Gen.</HI> 6.6. <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) means not any Change in Him, but only that the Face of his Conduct towards the Old World was, in the Event, as if he had repented he had made it, or as being fitly re&s;embled, by a Man's repenting of his having made a Thing, when he &s;ees it needful to de&s;troy it: So God's <HI>Foreknowing</HI> and <HI>prede&s;|tinating, (Rom.</HI> 8.29. <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) implies, not any thing <HI>fore</HI> or <HI>after, preceeding</HI> or <HI>&s;ucceeding</HI> in him, but only that the Event in his Conduct in this or the other In&s;tance, is as if he had <HI>for&s;oer</HI> or <HI>fore</HI> determined this or the other Event, or that his infinite Knowledge and unerring Pur|po&s;e, as they appear in the Facts, may be fitly re&s;em|bled by the fore-&s;ight of a wi&s;e Man who &s;hrewdly con|juctures beforehand what will happen in &s;uch and &s;uch Ca&s;es, and before determines and provides accordingly.</P>
<P>If therefore we would &s;peak with &s;trict Propriety con|cerning God in reference to this Matter, we mu&s;t not &s;ay that he <HI>fore-knows</HI> or <HI>fore-ordains,</HI> but that he <HI>knows</HI> and <HI>ordains,</HI> or appoints; <HI>i. e.</HI> That by one &s;ingle Act, one infinite all comprehending View, (to which all Things, that with re&s;pect to our narrow limited Minds, are <HI>pa&s;t, pre&s;ent</HI> or <HI>to come,</HI> are equally and at once pre&s;ent,) he &s;ees and knows, approves or di&s;approves his Creatures as being what they really are, and appoints, orders and conducts towards them accordingly.&mdash;For, as it cannot be but that God's Knowledge mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely perfect, He mu&s;t therefore <HI>fore-&s;ee,</HI> or rather <HI>&s;ee</HI> every thing cer|tainly as being what it is; nece&s;&s;ary Events as being nece&s;&s;ary, and contingent as being &s;uch, and the Actions of &s;uch as he has made free Agents as being free; but the Certainty, before it is, that any Thing will be, does

no more infer the Nece&s;&s;ity of it, than the certainty of it when it is, implies its being a nece&s;&s;ary Event. For if &s;o, every thing would be equally nece&s;&s;ary, and nothing could po&s;&s;ibly have been otherwi&s;e than it is: But to &s;ay this, is ab&s;urd; becau&s;e we are intuitively certain that we have, (and therefore God has given us,) &s;elf-exerting, and &s;elf-determining Powers, and con&s;e|quently that our Actions, and the Events of them do im|mediately depend on our own Wills, which is the Rea|&s;on why we blame out &s;elves when we do ami&s;s, as knowing we might have done otherwi&s;e. Wheareas if we &s;uppo&s;e our Actions immediately depending on the Will of God, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e them nece&s;&s;ary as to us, and con&s;equently that we are not to blame for them, being not properly <HI>Agents</HI> but <HI>acted</HI> and nece&s;&s;itated in what we do; which is ab&s;urd, as it makes God the Au|thor of our Sins, and is incon&s;i&s;tent with the very Being of Virtue or Vice, of Prai&s;e or Blame, and of moral Agency or moral Government.&mdash;Since therefore we know that the&s;e Things are not, and cannot be &s;o in them&s;elves, we are &s;ure they cannot be known or willed to be &s;uch by Almighty God.&mdash;</P>

Kingdom: They could not therefore brook it to think that their Nation mu&s;t now be rejected and the Gentiles called; this was a great Stumbling-block to them.&mdash; Now this is the Difficulty that St. <HI>Paul</HI> is here about to obviate: which he does by &s;hewing, 1&s;t.

<P>He argues in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, that they could not rea|&s;onably complain, becau&s;e God is &s;overeign and arbitra|ry in chu&s;ing whom he will to be his peculiar Peo|ple:&mdash;He was &s;o at fir&s;t in chu&s;ing the Seed of <HI>Abra|ham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> to enjoy the great Talent of Re|vealed Religion, and the Promi&s;e of the <HI>Me&s;iah,</HI> and in rejecting that of <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> and <HI>E&s;au</HI> from that Privilege, tho' they were not de&s;titute of a good Talent in enjoy|ing the le&s;&s;er Advantage of the Light of Nature; and &s;o he was now in rejecting the <HI>Jews</HI> for a Time, and calling the Gentiles to the yet greater and ine&s;timable Talent of the Go&s;pel.&mdash;I &s;ay of the&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence St. <HI>Paul</HI> is manife&s;tly to be under&s;tood.&mdash; For it is evident that tho&s;e In&s;tances he alledges of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>E&s;au,</HI> and of <HI>I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> cannot be un|der&s;tood of the Per&s;ons them&s;elves, (much le&s;s of their eternal State,) but of the Nations to de&s;cend from them, as will plainly appear if you look into the Texts in <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> from whence they are quoted.&mdash;Thus, as it was &s;aid of <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> Gen. 17.20. <HI>Twelve Princes &s;hall be begot, and I will make him a great Nation;</HI> &s;o of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>E&s;au,</HI> it was &s;aid to <HI>Rebecca,</HI> Gen. 25.23. <HI>Two Na|tions are in thy Womb, two manner of People &s;hall be &s;e|parated from thy Bowels, the one People &s;hall be &s;tronger

<P>It may be added here, that the Word <HI>Cho&s;en,</HI> when &s;et in Contradi&s;tinction to tho&s;e that are called, (as in <HI>Mat.</HI> 20.16. <HI>Many are called, but few cho&s;en,</HI>) &s;ignifies tho&s;e that are <HI>approved</HI> good Men, who comply with the Call of the Go&s;pel.&mdash;So that the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Words, is, that, tho' there were many that, at that Time, were <HI>called</HI> to the Knowledge of the Go&s;pel, yet there were comparatively but <HI>few</HI> that did comply with the Call, &s;o as, in Heart and Life to conform to it, and thereby become &s;uch as God approves of and delights in.&mdash;And the ob&s;tinately unbelieving and di&s;obedient are called <HI>Reprobate,</HI> as being <HI>di&s;approved</HI> and rejected of God, for their Di&s;obedience and ob&s;tinate per&s;i&s;ting in their Rebellion and Impenitency.&mdash;For other Texts &s;ee <HI>Whithy, Clarke</HI> and <HI>Clagget, and the E&s;&s;ay above|mentioned.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have given you a &s;hort Sketch of my Man|ner of thinking upon this Subject, whereof this is the Sum, <HI>viz.</HI> That in the Di&s;tribution of Talents and Fa|vours
<PB N="20" REF="005614_0024_1026B090DB6EA4E0">
in this State of Probation, the Sovereignty of God as a Benefactor does truly take Place; but in the future Di&s;tributions of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, ab&s;olute So|vereignty is intirely out of the Que&s;tion.&mdash;As a Judge deciding the eternal Condition of Men, God never once repre&s;ents him&s;elf as arbitrary, but every where, as pro|ceeding according to Equity, <HI>without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons;</HI> not treating Men according to any ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;ition he hath already made, but in exact proportion to their own Conduct in the u&s;e of the Talents committed to their Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>And I would wi&s;h it to be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, that it was the <HI>wicked Servant, (Mat.</HI> 25.24. compared with <HI>Luk.</HI> 19.22.) who repre&s;ented his Lord, (as many have lately done among us in the&s;e Times,) as <HI>reaping where he never &s;owed, and gathering where he had not &s;trowed,</HI> i. e. (like <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> requiring <HI>Brick without Straw,</HI>) re|quiring of his Creatures Things as impo&s;&s;ible for them to do, as it is to create a World, and damning them to all Eternity for not performing them.&mdash;Let it al&s;o be remembered, that in the Parable of the Labourers, <HI>Mat.</HI> 20.15. where God is repre&s;ented as making that An&s;wer, <HI>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own?</HI> which you built &s;o much upon, he does not mean to vindicate his Conduct as a Judge, as tho' in that Capacity he might arbitrarily reward or not reward as He plea&s;ed, (for he did exactly reward according to Sti|pulation,) but as a Benefactor at fir&s;t, in granting the Favour and making the Stipulation upon what Terms he thought fit, in which he is confe&s;&s;edly arbitrary.&mdash;</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the 25th of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> and all &s;uch Texts of Scripture as repre&s;ent God as a Judge rewarding and puni&s;hing, have not, as far as I can &s;ee, any Place at all in your Sy&s;tem of Divinity.&mdash;But in truth, I cannot think of a greater Di&s;honour that can be done to Almighty
<PB N="21" REF="005614_0025_1026B0C227903068">
God, than to repre&s;ent him as arbitrary con&s;idered as a Governour and a Judge, when he has taken abundant Care throughout the whole Scripture, from the Begin|ning of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> to the End of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> to repre&s;ent him&s;elf, not as an arbitrary, but as a moral Governour of the World; proceeding upon Stipulations with his Rea&s;onable Creatures;&mdash;treating them, not as <HI>Machines</HI> or Stocks and Stones, but as Rational and Moral Agents, &s;uch as he hath made them; be&s;towing Means and A&s;&s;i&s;tances, and u&s;ing Arguments, Motives and Per&s;ua|&s;ions with them, &s;uch as Promi&s;es, Threatnings, Exam|ples, and the like; and rewarding or puni&s;hing them according as they &s;hall be found to have conducted them&s;elves.&mdash;Such is the Notion or Conception that I am obliged to entertain of Almighty God, and with which every Thing in the Scriptures, I think, is clearly con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>But now in Con&s;equence of that &s;trange, unnatural and un&s;criptural Notion of the Almighty, which your Doc|trine &s;eems to imply, you appear to me, in effect, to fly in the Face of the whole Scriptures, by denying the Being of any Promi&s;es at all, as being incon&s;i&s;tent with the Divine Sovereignty.&mdash;I confe&s;s, you, and tho&s;e on your Side, are herein con&s;i&s;tent enough with your &s;elves; for &s;uppo&s;ing a meer &s;overeign ab&s;olute and arbitrary Deci&s;ion of the eternal Fate of Mankind, antecedent to, or without any Con&s;ideration of their per&s;onal Behavi|our, it is plain that all Stipulations, Promi&s;es, Threaten|ings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are but a meer Farce, and can have no &s;erious Meaning in them.&mdash;But then do but con&s;ider what you are doing; for if you deny the Being of any Promi&s;es con&s;i&s;tent with the Sovereignty of God, you do in Effect, de&s;troy the very Being of the New Covenant, and, by Con&s;equence, the whole De&s;ign and Purport of all re|veal'd Religion; which is likewi&s;e the &s;ad Havock that

<P>One Mi&s;take is, that you &s;eem to apprehend it my De&s;ign to enter into a formal Controver&s;y with you on the&s;e Subjects, by your Expre&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Duel</HI> with me:&mdash; Indeed, <HI>Sir,</HI> if you thought &s;o, you was really mi&s;taken, for I a&s;&s;ured you then, that it was with no di&s;putacious Temper or De&s;ign that I wrote what I did; and I now a&s;&s;ure you, that my main De&s;ign was, that you might, if po&s;&s;ible, be made &s;en&s;ible that mo&s;t of the Occa&s;ions of your uncharitable Di&s;po&s;itions towards us, were really owing to your not rightly apprehending what our Doc|trine truly is: And I hoped if I could lead you into a right under&s;tanding of our manner of explaining the <HI>Divine Sovereignty</HI> and the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of the Go&s;pel, as con&s;i&s;tent therewith, you would drop tho&s;e dark Thoughts you entertained of us, or at lea&s;t have &s;ome Charity for us, tho' you could not altogether think with us, as we have for you, tho' we cannot intirely think with you: For really there is nothing grieves me &s;o much as that &s;o bitter and uncharitable a Temper &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t and be propagated among Chri&s;tians.&mdash;</P>
<P>I might remark upon &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in your Letter; but there is one I cannot be content to pa&s;s by, and that is, your Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>being &s;anctified in the Womb,</HI> where|in I &s;uppo&s;e you allude to the like Expre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Jer.</HI> 1.5. which you &s;eem to under&s;tand of the real inherent Sanctification of the Spirit; whereas it is manife&s;t, that

<P>Another Mi&s;take you labour under, is in apprehending that I aim at <HI>undermining</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Soul-humbling Doctrines of the Go&s;pel.</HI>&mdash;To which I an&s;wer, No, <HI>Sir,</HI> God forbid!&mdash;I firmly believe it to be the great De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel to humble the Souls of Men, and to &s;ub|due their perver&s;e Wills, and reduce them to an intire Union with the Will of God, to &s;ubmit to all his &s;ove|reign Appointments, and to take him in his own Way, and be content to be &s;aved upon his Terms.&mdash;This is plain from the whole Run of my Letter, and intirely con&s;i&s;tent with it.&mdash;I mu&s;t therefore beg leave to &s;u&s;pect that you did not read it with &s;ufficient Candor and At|tention, which I would yet wi&s;h you to do, rather than to per&s;i&s;t in &s;o hard an Opinion of me, for which I can|not be &s;en&s;ible I have given you any ju&s;t Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But if you cannot think me altogether right in my Notion of the Sovereignty and Promi&s;es of God, I beg you will not con&s;ider me as an Oppo&s;er of the Word of God, (as your Letter &s;eems to imply;) for I am &s;ure I oppo&s;e nothing, but rejoice in every thing, that, (agree|able to the In&s;tructions of the Go&s;pel,) can tend to the everla&s;ting Happine&s;s of the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>And if after all our well-meant Inquiries, we cannot attain to think alike here in this dark and infirm State, let us however put the be&s;t Con&s;truction we can on each other's Conduct, and, as I &s;aid, hope at length to meet together in that happy State before us, where all Dark|ne&s;s and Prejudice &s;hall be forever done away, and no|thing but God and Truth and Love &s;hall forever reign!&mdash;</P>
