<P>HOW beautiful are the Feet of him that bringeth good Tidings, that publi&s;heth the Go&s;pel of Peace!

<PB N="6" REF="005956_0004_1026E1B891A814A0">
Men bear to an <HI>Enemy.</HI> Yet, this is a Ca&s;e which too often happens, to make the greate&s;t Caution, with Re&s;pect to it, both in Mini&s;ter and People, &s;eem unnece&s;&s;ary; and a Di&s;cour&s;e upon it at this Time un&s;ea&s;onable. An Example of it, for the In&s;truction and Warning of all, is recorded in the <HI>Pa&s;&s;age</HI> now before us.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul,</HI> at his fir&s;t coming among the <HI>Galatians,</HI> and preaching the Go&s;pel to them, was very highly e&s;teemed and loved by them. They received him as an <HI>Angel</HI> of GOD&mdash;as the LORD's Me&s;&s;enger to them; even as CHRIST JESUS, for whom he was an Amba&s;&s;ador, re|pre&s;enting his Per&s;on, and acting in his Stead. They treated him with all proper Marks of extraordinary Re|&s;pect: accounted it, and often &s;pake of it, as their &s;pe|cial Felicity, to have the Go&s;pel preached to them by &s;o excellent, able, and faithful a Mini&s;ter of it; and were ready to do, or part with, any Thing, for his Sake. Had it been <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> to help him thereby, they <HI>would have pluck|ed out their own Eyes, and given them to him.</HI> But alas! they were &s;oon removed, &s;eparated in Affection <HI>from him, that called them into the Grace of</HI> CHRIST. Whereupon he thus expo&s;tulated with them, <HI>Where is then the Ble&s;&s;|edne&s;s that ye &s;pake of?</HI> Is all your boa&s;ted Happine&s;s in me, as your Apo&s;tle, now at an end? <HI>Am I therefore become your Enemy, becau&s;e I tell you the Truth?</HI> Am I indeed, as you take me to be, your Enemy, meaning you Mi&s;chief, and hurting your Souls, becau&s;e I have preach|ed, and &s;till per&s;i&s;t to declare unto you the Truth?</P>
<P>And if from &s;uch an One as <HI>Paul,</HI> the warm Affecti|ons of the <HI>Galatians</HI> were &s;o alienated, it is the le&s;s to be wonder'd at, that there &s;hould be in all Ages &s;ince, as we &s;ee in the pre&s;ent, many In&s;tances of the like Nature; which may neverthele&s;s lead us to inquire,</P>
<P>Whence it is, or, how it comes to pa&s;s, That the ardent Affections of People to their Mini&s;ters
<PB N="7" REF="005956_0005_102729EBAAA966E8">
are apt &s;oon to cool; yea, oftentimes to be wholly alie|nated from them?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Through Infirmity of the Fle&s;h,</HI> Mini&s;ters preach the Go&s;pel: And this may occa&s;ion an Alienation of People's Affections from them. <HI>Ye know how through Infirmity of the Fle&s;h, I preached the Go&s;pel unto you at the fir&s;t. And my Temptation which was in my Fle&s;h, ye de&s;pi&s;ed not, nor rejected.</HI> At the fir&s;t they did not, but afterwards (it &s;eems) they did, take Offence at it, and de&s;pi&s;e, and reject him for it.</P>
<P><HI>The Infirmity of the Fle&s;h,</HI> may denote the Weakne&s;s of human Nature; the Imperfection that attended <HI>Paul,</HI> and is to be found in every one that preacheth the Go&s;|pel in this frail and mortal State. 1 Cor. ii. 3. <HI>I was with you in Weakne&s;s.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding the high Station, and dignifying Character of the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, yet are they weak Creatures, as ju&s;tly, if not by Way of Contempt, as vulgarly &s;o termed. Though they are <HI>Angels</HI> by Office, yet do they not excel in Strength like tho&s;e which are &s;o by Nature: But are Men of like Pa&s;|&s;ions with others &mdash; Compa&s;&s;ed with <HI>Infirmity;</HI> as every <HI>High-Prie&s;t,</HI> taken from among Men, was, under the Law. God hath con&s;ulted, not only his own Glory, but al&s;o the Peoples Advantage, in putting the Trea&s;ure of the Go&s;pel into earthern Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;peaking to them by Men, like them&s;elves, formed out of the Clay. Yet, for this natural <HI>Infirmity of the Fle&s;h,</HI> thro' which Mini|&s;ters preach, they are &s;ometimes de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected. It proves a Temptation unto People, to think meanly of them, and an Occa&s;ion of their Di&s;re&s;pect and Di&s;gu&s;t at them. For they are apt to look for <HI>Angelical</HI> Perfection in their Mini&s;ters, not willing to make them the common Allowances, that are due to the Frailty of human Na|ture: and would have them be &s;o &s;piritual, and live &s;o by Faith, as not to care for the Things of this Life:
<PB N="8" REF="005956_0006_102729ED4066E3D8">
and to &s;ow unto them &s;piritual Things, and not reap their carnal Things.</P>
<P><HI>By Infirmity of the Fle&s;h,</HI> the Apo&s;tle may intend &s;ome per&s;onal Imperfection, bodily Defect, or accidental Weak|ne&s;s, attending him. There is a Tradition, that <HI>Paul</HI> (according to the Signification of his Name) was a little Man of low Stature: that his Body was crooked, his Voice &s;mall, and not very plea&s;ant. And for &s;uch In|firmity of the Fle&s;h, he might be unrea&s;onably de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;ome. 2 Cor. x. 10. <HI>For his Letters (&s;ay they) are weighty and powerful, but his bodily Pre&s;ence is weak and his Speech contemptible.</HI> So weak in their Judgment are &s;ome People, as to withhold, or withdraw de&s;erved E&s;|teem and Affection from tho&s;e, who through any &s;uch like unavoidable Infirmity of the Fle&s;h preach the Go&s;|pel unto them.</P>
<P>But, the greate&s;t Infirmity of the Fle&s;h, which the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> here hath Reference to, was his <HI>Affliction,</HI> the Per|&s;ecution he &s;uffered in preaching the Go&s;pel. This he often calleth by that Name. 2 Cor. xii. 9, 10. 'Mo&s;t gladly therefore will I rather glory in my Infirmities, that the Power of CHRIST may re&s;t upon me. Therefore I take Plea&s;ure in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Nece&s;&s;ities, in Per&s;ecutions, in Di&s;tre&s;&s;es for CHRIST'S Sake; for when I am weak, then am I &s;trong.' He &s;peaks in that Chapter of a <HI>Thorn in the Fle&s;h,</HI> &s;harp Per&s;ecution; which the An&s;wer of GOD to his Prayer that it might depart from him, &s;tiles <HI>Weakne&s;s.</HI> Ver. 7, 9.</P>
<P><HI>Infirmity of the Fle&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> in our Text calleth his <HI>Temptation</HI> which was in his <HI>Fle&s;h.</HI> It was a Trial of his Faith and Fidelity, and of People's &s;incere Regard for him. At the fir&s;t, the <HI>Galatians de&s;pi&s;ed not, nor re|jected it,</HI> nor him for it; but afterwards they became prejudic'd again&s;t him, on Account of it: That Per&s;e|cution e&s;pecially, which he &s;uffered from the Tongues
<PB N="9" REF="005956_0007_102729EED0E47E50">
of <HI>fal&s;e Teachers,</HI> had this bad Effect upon them. There were &s;uch then as preached CHRIST of <HI>Envy</HI> and <HI>Conten|tion,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing to add Affliction to St. <HI>Paul's Bonds;</HI> en|deavouring to vex and grieve his Spirit, to le&s;&s;en his Re|putation and Intere&s;t among the People, and di&s;courage him in his Work. He &s;peaks of them in the Ver&s;e af|ter my Text; <HI>They zealou&s;ly affect you, but not well: they would exclude you.</HI>&mdash; You from the Liberty and Pri|vileges of the Go&s;pel, as well as me from the Dignity of Apo&s;tle&s;hip&mdash;<HI>that ye might affect them&mdash;them only.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Afflictions</HI> of Mini&s;ters, which are their <HI>Temptati|ons</HI> in their Fle&s;h, Poverty, Sickne&s;s and Weakne&s;s of Body, &s;ome corporal Deficiency or Deformity, Contempt and Per&s;ecution from the Men of the World; and a|bove all, Reproaches from fal&s;e Brethren, ill U&s;age a|mong their <HI>Mother's Children,</HI> that are cau&s;ele&s;ly angry with them, too often cool the warm Affections of their People towards them, and alienate their Minds from them.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t unju&s;tly are Mini&s;ters de&s;pi&s;ed, and rejected, be|cau&s;e &s;uch <HI>Infirmity of the Fle&s;h</HI> attends them in preach|ing the Go&s;pel. The more worthy are they of Re&s;pect and Love on that Account: That &s;uch Di&s;couragement does not hinder their engaging and continuing in a Work of &s;o great Difficulty and Danger. They give clearer Proof of their Love to Souls, and di&s;cover greater For|titude of Spirit, by preaching the Go&s;pel through <HI>Infir|mity of the Fle&s;h.</HI> It argues, to a Judgment of Charity, the Strength of Grace in their Souls, overcoming this <HI>Temptation</HI> which is in their Fle&s;h. <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 24. 'Bonds and Afflictions abide me. But none of tho&s;e Things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my &s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my Cour&s;e with Joy, and the Mini&s;try which I have received of the LORD JESUS, to te&s;tify the Go&s;pel of the Grace of GOD.'</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="005956_0008_102729F0C7BEAE68">2. Mini&s;ters are &s;ometimes look'd upon by People as their Enemies, for telling them the <HI>Truth. Am I there|fore become your Enemy, becau&s;e I tell you the Truth? Paul</HI>'s declaring the Truth of GOD &s;o fully and plainly to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> made them count him their Enemy. He preached the true and only Go&s;pel of CHRIST unto them. <HI>I certify you, Brethren,</HI> &s;aith he, Chap. i. Ver. 11. <HI>That the Go&s;pel which was preached of me, is not after Man, for I neither received of Man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. So a&s;&s;ured was he of the Divinity of his Doctrine, that he there de|nounces a terrible <HI>Anathema</HI> again&s;t Man or Angel, that &s;hould preach the contrary. <HI>Though we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Go&s;pel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accur&s;ed. As we &s;aid before, &s;o &s;ay I now again, if any Man preach any other Go&s;pel unto you, than that ye have received, let him be accur&s;ed.</HI> Awful Words indeed! to make every Preacher take heed to his Doctrine.</P>
<P>The Truth which <HI>Paul</HI> hath &s;pecial Reference to in the Text, is that of Chri&s;tians Freedom from the Ser|vitude of the <HI>Mo&s;aic Yoke,</HI> the Bondage of the Ceremo|nial Law. He throughly under&s;tood, and boldly a&s;&s;ert|ed the <HI>Chri&s;tian Liberty:</HI> And this was improv'd again&s;t him, as a popular Prejudice, among the Jewi&s;h Converts to Chri&s;tianity. Many of them were &s;till wedded to their old religious Service, and retain'd a fond Opinion of the Excellence and Unalterablene&s;s of the ritual In&s;ti|tution. So bewitch'd were the fooli&s;h <HI>Galatians,</HI> as to be enamour'd with Bondage; &s;o unrea&s;onable, as to count him their Enemy, who was their Advocate for Liberty.</P>
<P>It is the great and indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty of Mini&s;ters, to tell People the <HI>Truth.</HI> They are appointed by CHRIST to teach it. This is the Work, to which they are &s;et apart. And for the due Performance of which, they
<PB N="11" REF="005956_0009_102729F2A09D1B18">
mu&s;t have the <HI>Knowledge of the Truth;</HI> need be better acquainted with it, than tho&s;e unto whom they are to tell it. The <HI>Law of Truth</HI> &s;hould be in their Mouth; and they always &s;peak forth the <HI>Words of Truth.</HI> GOD's Word is the Truth, which they are &s;olemnly charged to preach. 2 Tim. iv. 2. <HI>Preach the Word</HI>&mdash;the Go&s;pel, the Word of Truth; that People may be taught as the Truth is in JESUS; rather than as it is in the Writings of any Men, how renowned &s;oever for Orthodoxy, or admired for Learning. CHRIST is the Truth, which Mi|ni&s;ters are to preach&mdash;the true Scripture-Doctrins con|cerning his <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Offices,</HI> con&s;tituted and de&s;igned by infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s for the Relief and Salvation of fallen, mi&s;erable Men. In Con&s;equence of which gracious Di&s;pen&s;ation, and to their being Partakers of the Benefit, Mini&s;ters are to tell People the Nece&s;&s;ity and Nature of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> which is <HI>Truth in the inward Parts;</HI> and of <HI>evangelical Obedience,</HI> &mdash; the Way of Truth, which mu&s;t be known, and walked in by all, that through Grace would arrive to a happy and glorious E&s;tate in Heaven.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters are to tell People the whole Truth; though in rightly dividing the Word of Truth, they &s;hould in|&s;i&s;t mo&s;t on tho&s;e Parts of it, which are of greate&s;t Mo|ment or Concern to the Honour of GOD, and Intere&s;t of Souls&mdash;have the directe&s;t Influence on Men's Practice in this World, and their Happine&s;s in that which is to come.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters &s;hould tell People the Truth <HI>plainly;</HI> that by Manife&s;tation of it, they may commend them&s;elves to every Man's Con&s;cience in the Sight of GOD. They &s;hould &s;peak <HI>boldly</HI> in a&s;&s;erting and defending the Truth, and reproving of Sin, which is oppo&s;ite to it. Jer. xxiii. 28. <HI>He that hath my Word, let him &s;peak my Word faith|fully; what is the Chaff to the Wheat, &s;aith the LORD?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005956_0010_102729F91A1CB528">Mini&s;ters are bound to tell People the Truth, in their public Di&s;cour&s;es, and private Applications to them, and by exemplary Walking before them in the Truth. The Di&s;charge of their whole Office con&s;i&s;ts in their telling People the Truth, in the various Ways which they are requir'd to do it, on Pain of being look'd upon, and dealt with by GOD, as the fal&s;e&s;t of Men.</P>
<P>But, for their Faithfulne&s;s therein, People &s;ometimes account and treat them as their Enemies. So did the <HI>Jews</HI> CHRIST. Joh. viii. 20. <HI>Now ye &s;eek to kill me, a Man that hath told you the Truth, which I have heard of GOD.</HI> And &s;o per&s;ecuted they all the Prophets, and Apo&s;tles: And the be&s;t Mini&s;ters, in all Ages of the Church, have been for this, in &s;ome Degree or other, hated and rejected. The Minds of proud and carnal Men are &s;hut up, and barred with various Appetites, Hu|mours, and Pa&s;&s;ions, again&s;t the Truth, &s;o that they do not admit it. They receive not the Love of the Truth, and therefore e&s;teem not them in Love, for their Work's Sake, who tell it them. The Truth which they cannot readily &s;wallow, nor ea&s;ily dige&s;t, occa&s;ions &s;our Preju|dices in them again&s;t the Di&s;pen&s;ers of it. If a Preacher by the Light of heavenly Truth, detects and reproves a wicked Man, he is provoked to &s;ay unto him as <HI>Ahab</HI> to <HI>Elijah, Ha&s;t thou found me, O mine Enemy?</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xxi. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> If he delivers any Thing contrary to the prejudicate Notions of a good Man, he al&s;o is apt to be offended, and to re|ject him as an Heretick.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mini&s;ters may be wanting in their <HI>affectionate Re|gards</HI> for the People, and this may le&s;&s;en the People's for them. Would to GOD! that none had ever in this Way, given greater Cau&s;e of Di&s;&s;atisfaction, than the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> whom the fooli&s;h <HI>Galatians</HI> deem'd their Enemy, becau&s;e he told them the Truth. As
<PB N="13" REF="005956_0011_102729FAAEF243C8">
Faithfulne&s;s, &s;o Failure, in the mini&s;terial Work (that eminent Office of Love,) may &s;ometimes occa&s;ion the E&s;trangement of Affections from them that are employ'd in it.</P>
<P>There are none more de&s;picable Creatures on Earth, more worthy to be rejected of GOD, and all the Peo|ple, than Men of corrupt Minds, and de&s;titute of the Truth, and of Love to CHRIST and Souls, thru&s;ting them&s;elves, by &s;ome Means or other, into the &s;acred Office; and, under Pretence of extraordinary Zeal and Charity, &s;o exerci&s;ing it for a while, as to captivate the Affections of an injudicious Multitude, and betray them into Error, Sin, and Ruin. I&s;ai. ix. 15. <HI>The Prophet that teacheth Lies, he is the Tail.</HI> Ho&s;. 4. 6. <HI>Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t rejected Knowledge, I will al&s;o reject thee, that thou &s;halt be no Prie&s;t to me.</HI> Mal. ii. 8. 9. <HI>Ye are departed out of the Way, ye have cau&s;ed many to &s;tumble at the Law: ye have corrupted the Covenant of Levi, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts. Therefore have I al&s;o made you contemptible and ba&s;e before all the People, according as ye have not kept my Ways, but have been partial in the Law.</HI> GOD hath his Time to di&s;|cover fal&s;e Teachers, and put them to Shame and Con|fu&s;ion. 'Of this Sort (&s;ays the <HI>Apostle</HI>) are they which creep into Hou&s;es, and lead captive &s;illy Women, laden with Sins, led away with diver&s;e Lu&s;ts: ever learning, and never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth. Now as <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres</HI> with&s;tood <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;o do the&s;e al&s;o re&s;i&s;t the Truth: Men of corrupt Minds, Reprobates concerning the Faith. But they &s;hall proceed no further: for their Folly &s;hall be manife&s;t unto all Men, as theirs al&s;o was. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 6, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>But even &s;uch as are true Friends to CHRIST and Souls, and who from a Principle of &s;incere and &s;ervent Love, undertake to feed his Sheep and Lambs, their Affections

may be warme&s;t toward their People, at their fir&s;t com|ing among&s;t them. Through Infirmity of the Fle&s;h they may afterwards grow more dull in their Work, re|mi&s;s in their Care to plea&s;e all Men for their Profit; and through Temptation fail more in the Performance of their Duty. Unto the Angel of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> CHRIST &s;aid, <HI>I have &s;omewhat again&s;t thee, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t left thy fir&s;t Love.</HI> Rev. ii. 4. And as mini&s;terial Zeal abateth, the People's Love is apt to wax cold, when indeed the Fervour of it is mo&s;t needed, and &s;hould be u&s;ed to re-inflame that Zeal. Col. iv. 17. <HI>Say to</HI> Ar|chippus, <HI>take heed to the Mini&s;try, which thou ha&s;t received in the LORD, that thou fulfil it.</HI> 'It is good (&s;aith the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> in the Context) to be zealou&s;ly affected <HI>always</HI> in a good Thing.' It is good for a Mini&s;ter to be &s;o in the Execution of his Office to the End; that &s;o he be not, in any Mea&s;ure, the faulty Cau&s;e of their becoming coldly, or evil affected towards him.</P>
<P N="4">4. Through natural <HI>Incon&s;tancy</HI> of their Minds, People are &s;ubject to this Change of them, re&s;pecting their Mi|ni&s;ters. Scarce any Thing is more mutable than the human Mind; nor any Particular, in which the Incon|&s;tancy of it is oftner di&s;cover'd, than in People's Regard for their Mini&s;ters; one Day, extolling; and the next, decrying of them, of which &s;ometimes no other &s;o ju&s;t Account can be given, as the natural Ficklene&s;s of Man; who is un&s;table as Water: a re&s;tle&s;s Sort of Creature, that is given to Change.

ye were willing for a Sea&s;on to rejoice in his Light.</HI> Ex|ceedingly plea&s;ed were the People with <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, when he began his Mini&s;try among them. The Word expre&s;&s;ing this, &s;ignifies, that they leaped for Joy&mdash; danced about him, as Children about a Bon-fire. But, like Children, they were not long plea&s;ed with him: rejoiced in his Light only for a Sea&s;on&mdash;for an Hour. He did burn and &s;hine, in his Doctrine and Life, with equal Zeal and Lu&s;tre; but they cooled in their Affecti|ons toward him, and &s;oon lo&s;t their E&s;teem for one that was greater than a Prophet.</P>
<P N="5">5. To the Want of due Care in <HI>placing</HI> the Affecti|ons on Mini&s;ters, may frequently be owing the &s;udden Alienation thereof from them. An Error in the fir&s;t Step, betrays People into their After mi&s;conduct and Mi|&s;ery, in Re&s;pect of their Mini&s;ters. As when they are ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate in the Choice of them. Affecti|ons that run before the Under&s;tanding, and are not guid|ed by Judgment, are vagrant, and never well &s;ettled. If People's E&s;teem for Mini&s;ters, be not founded in the mo&s;t &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial Qualifications of &s;uch; if it be rai&s;ed on no firmer Ground, than &s;ome little Accom|pli&s;hments, external Embelli&s;hments, and tho&s;e &s;uperfi|cial Ornaments, which &s;et off a Preacher, and with which weak Minds are apt to be much taken at fir&s;t, it is not likely to continue. Affections which are excited, and drawn forth by tho&s;e Things which commend Mini&s;ters to the Fancies, more than to the Con&s;ciences of People, generally &s;oon vani&s;h and expire. The clo&s;e&s;t and &s;trong|e&s;t Attachment, is by the &s;acred Ties of Con&s;cience. People &s;hould e&s;teem Mini&s;ters highly in Love, for their <HI>Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">'s Sake,</HI> and the Glory that may thence redound to GOD, and the Good which may accrue to their own Souls. If blind and perver&s;e Selfi&s;hne&s;s, or Party Zeal, lead in the Choice of Mini&s;ters, People ordinarily &s;oon fall into &s;ome Ditch, out of which it is hard to recover. If their Affections are actuated by &s;ini&s;ter Views, and
<PB N="16" REF="005956_0014_10272A04DBA3E998">
they have Men's Per&s;ons in Admiration, becau&s;e of Ad|vantage; for the accompli&s;hing &s;ome revengeful, or co|vetous, or ambitious Project, they change with the Wind, and vary as the Contingencies of &s;ecular Affairs. Lu&s;t, Pa&s;&s;ion, Humour, Intere&s;t, are Things very ver&s;atile and uncertain. Whence they that are govern'd by them, mu&s;t needs be double-minded Men, and un&s;table in all their Ways. A carnal Spring may &s;end forth a great Flow, a high Tide, of Affections toward Mini&s;ters; but there is wont to follow as low an Ebb. <HI>Stony Ground Hearers</HI> are u&s;ually affected to the Preachers, as they are to the Word it &s;elf: they hear them, and anon with Joy receive them; yet have they not Root in them&s;elves, but are well-plea&s;ed for a while only; for when any Thing ari&s;eth a little cro&s;&s;ing their Humour or Intere&s;t, by and by they are offended. <HI>Mat.</HI> xiii. 20, 21.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>Malice</HI> and <HI>Hand</HI> of <HI>Satan</HI> may be indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly employed in alienating the Hearts of People from their Mini&s;ters. That it was &s;o in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Ga|latians,</HI> with Re&s;pect to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> may be clearly inti|mated by his &s;peaking of them as a <HI>bewitched</HI> People. Chap. iii. ver. 1. <HI>O fooli&s;h Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye &s;hould not obey the Truth?</HI>&mdash; And &s;o count me your <HI>Enemy</HI> for telling it you? Heretical Teachers, which &s;educed them, were a Sort of &s;piritual Sorcerers, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Devil, in ca&s;ting &s;uch Mi&s;ts before the Eyes of their Minds, that they were led away with the Error of the Wicked, and fell from their own Stedfa&s;t|ne&s;s. The Devil may have con&s;iderable, though an in|vi&s;ible, Hand, in the Operations of all the forementioned Cau&s;es, in the malignant Influence of all the Occa&s;ions, whereby People are alienated from their Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI>'s Thorn in the Fle&s;h, the chief Infirmity of it, through which he preached the Go&s;pel, was the <HI>Me&s;&s;en|ger of Satan</HI> buffetting him, 2 Cor. xii. 7. Fitly doth he &s;o call it, though it might not be an <HI>evil Angel</HI> im|mediately
<PB N="17" REF="005956_0015_10272A07D1EB91F8">
troubling and vexing him, as <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> &s;up|pos'd, but a cruel Per&s;ecutor, whom the Devil &s;tirred up again&s;t him.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Briars</HI> and <HI>Thorns,</HI> that are with faithful Mi|ni&s;ters, and the <HI>Scorpions,</HI> among whom they &s;ometimes dwell, are <HI>Me&s;&s;engers</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> de&s;ign'd and improv'd by him, for their Affliction and Hurt; but permitted and over-ruled by GOD, for their Humiliation and Good.</P>
<P>By the Spirit that worketh in the Children of Di&s;obe|dience, they are &s;ometimes filled with Wrath, with Envy, and Indignation, with Madne&s;s and Contradiction, again&s;t tho&s;e who tell them the Truth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Father of Lies,</HI> by high Pretences to Truth, when he is transformed into an Angel of Light, &s;tirreth up bitter Zeal again&s;t the faithful Preachers of it: And by &s;etting one Part of GOD's Truth in Oppo&s;ition to ano|ther, doth cau&s;e Men to reject it, and them that maintain the Con&s;i&s;tence, and are &s;et for the Defence, of the whole.</P>
<P>The Tempter is &s;ubtil and active to hinder Mini&s;ters in their Work, that, failing therein by Infirmity, by Neg|ligence, or Pravity, they may incur the Cen&s;ure of good People, and bring their Office, as well as Per&s;ons, into Contempt among the Profane. The <HI>great red Dragon's Tail drew a third Part of the Stars of Heaven, and did ca&s;t them to the Earth.</HI> Rev. xii. 4. Many are the ba&s;e Arts, In&s;truments, and Means, which the Devil u&s;eth to hinder the Shining and Influence of the &s;piritual Stars, in the Firmament of the Church &mdash; to cau&s;e them to fall from their heavenly Profe&s;&s;ion into the Dirt of this World and an earthly Cour&s;e of Life, which renders them vile and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Such being the common Occa&s;ions and Cau&s;es of the Alienation of People's Affections from Mini&s;ters, that
<PB N="18" REF="005956_0016_10272A09AB9E6990">
were at fir&s;t very welcome and dear to them; <HI>Both</HI> may receive <HI>In&s;truction</HI> therefrom.</P>
<P N="1">1. Mini&s;ters may not reckon upon the long Continu|ance of People's warm Affections towards them. If at his fir&s;t preaching the Go&s;pel to a People, a Mini&s;ter is not de&s;pi&s;ed nor rejected, for any Infirmity of the Fle&s;h, if they receive him as an <HI>Angel of GOD,</HI> even as CHRIST JESUS; and they would part with their Eyes, rather than with him: Yet this Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s may be &s;hort-liv'd, may very &s;oon vani&s;h, and he in their Mi&s;-apprehen&s;ion and Male-treatment of him, become their Enemy Let him not therefore, as a <HI>Novice,</HI> be lifted up with Pride, when he &s;its highe&s;t in the E&s;timation of People, and is enter|tained with their loude&s;t Applau&s;es. There may be a &s;udden Change of their Di&s;po&s;ition and Behaviour to|ward him. And if &s;o, though it will be grievous unto him to &s;ee his People, from whom he &s;hould have Com|fort, decline in their Regards for him, and grow into a Wearine&s;s and Di&s;like of him; yet, let him not think &s;trange concerning this Trial of his Fidelity to CHRIST and Love for them, as if &s;ome &s;trange Thing had hap|pened to him. This is a Temptation common unto Mi|ni&s;ters. "It has been an old Practice among Profe&s;&s;ors, not to like their Pa&s;tors long."</P>
<P N="2">2. Mini&s;ters &s;hould take heed to them&s;elves, that they do not, by their own Default, loo&s;e the People's Affec|tions. It is unworthy the Character&mdash;it is below the Spirit of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, to plea&s;e all Men, but for their Profit. They &s;tudy to approve them&s;elves unto GOD; and at the &s;ame Time, to &s;ecure their Intere&s;t in the Affections of People, <HI>Not</HI> (as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith to the <HI>Phi|lippians,</HI> Chap. iv. ver. 17.) <HI>becau&s;e they de&s;ire a Gift; but de&s;ire Fruit that may abound to their Account.</HI> And &s;ince People are &s;o apt to take Offence, Mini&s;ters need be the more careful that they give none. 2 Cor. vi. 3. <HI>Giving no Offence in any Thing, that the Mini&s;try be not

blamed.</HI> That no Man de&s;pi&s;e them, how prudent, as well as faithful, ought they to be, in their whole Conduct?</P>
<P>And &s;uch of them as for a good End &s;eek to main|tain their own Credit among the People, will not go about to weaken the Reputation of others, their Fellow-Labour|ers; will be as far from in&s;inuating any Thing to their Di&s;advantage in the Mini&s;try, as from doing any Thing to their own&mdash; Be far from depreciating, and running down others, that they may advance and magnify them|&s;elves&mdash; far from endeavouring to exclude others, that they may ingratiate them&s;elves, and po&s;&s;e&s;s all the Room in the Hearts of People. For they are de&s;irous of others U&s;efulne&s;s and Succe&s;s in the Mini&s;try, as well as of their own. If the Glory of GOD, and the Churches Good be not the End of Mini&s;ters, they are not Chri&s;ti|ans; and may not this End be attained by our Brethren's Gifts, as well as by ear's? Should one Workman ma|lign another, that helpeth him to do his Ma&s;ter's Work? Alas! that ever there &s;hould be &s;uch a Thing as <HI>Envy,</HI> among Fellow-Workers to the Kingdom of GOD! Any Strife between the Servants of the humble JESUS, which of them &s;hould be greate&s;t in the Opinion of Men, and any Endeavours, if not open and notorious, yet &s;ly and plau&s;ible, to di&s;grace, and &s;upplant one another! Cau|telou&s;ly tender &s;hould they all be of their own, and each other's Intere&s;t in the good E&s;teem and Affections of People. Yet</P>
<P N="3">3. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t tell People the <HI>Truth,</HI> although they &s;hould count, and call them their Enemies therefor. Wo to them that &s;ell the Truth of GOD at &s;o low a Price, as the Favour of Men! 'Do I now (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> Chap. i. ver. 10.) per&s;uade Men, or GOD? or do I &s;eek to plea&s;e Men? For if I yet plea&s;|ed Men, I &s;hould not be the Servant of CHRIST.'&mdash;i. e. If I &s;o far plea&s;ed them, as not to tell them the Truth; but accommodated my Preaching to their fal&s;e Notions,
<PB N="20" REF="005956_0018_10272A1090580178">
corrupt Humours, and favourite Lu&s;ts. If Mini&s;ters to gain, or keep, the Affections of People, that cannot en|dure <HI>&s;ound Doctrine,</HI> &s;peak not <HI>the Things that become it;</HI> if they handle the Word of GOD deceitfully, &s;ophi&s;ti|cating and adulterating of it, and &s;o tempering it to the vitious Palates of Men; they are really their Enemies, Betrayers, and Murderers of Souls. They cannot be pure from the Blood of all Men, if, to avoid their Di&s;|plea&s;ure, they &s;hun to declare unto them all the Coun&s;el of GOD. And had we not rather our People &s;hould account us their Enemies, for telling them the Truth; than we be found &s;uch, for concealing it from them? What is the Clamour of their Tongues again&s;t us in this World, to the Cry of their Blood for ever in the next? O, let us not, to prevent their Murmurings, or to obtain their Commendations now, expo&s;e our &s;elves to their &s;ore Complaints, fierce Accu&s;ations, and de&s;perate Cur&s;es hereafter. Can we imagine damned Angels will be more uncomfortable A&s;&s;ociates in Mi&s;ery, than poor wretched Souls, mi&s;led by us into the &s;ame Place of Torments? O that there never in this Land, may be Occa&s;ion and Ground for that Complaint, in Jer. v. 30, 31. <HI>A won|derful and horrible Thing is committed in the Land. The Prophets prophe&s;y fal&s;ly, and the Prie&s;ts bear Rule by their Means, and my People love to have it &s;o. And what will ye do in the End thereof?</HI></P>
<P>Faithful Mini&s;ters and Friends to Souls, notwith&s;tand|ing all that they have &s;uffered, and been &s;hamefully in|treated, as ye know, will be <HI>bold</HI> in GOD, to &s;peak unto People the Go&s;pel of GOD with much Contention.</P>
<P>As Mini&s;ters &s;hould open their Mouth boldly, to make known the My&s;tery of the Go&s;pel, &s;o let them do it with <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> in the fitte&s;t Time and Manner. The Truth may be deliver'd by them &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably, &s;o indige&s;t|edly, &s;o incoherently, &s;o improperly, as to prejudice the Minds of People again&s;t it.&mdash; As may "rather open

than &s;top the Mouths of Gain&s;ayers, and &s;ooner di&s;cre|dit the Truth, than convert the Adver&s;ary." CHRIST &s;pake the Word unto the People, as they were able to hear it. <HI>Mark</HI> iv. 33. I have (&s;aid he to his Di&s;ciples) yet many Things to &s;ay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. <HI>John</HI> xvi. 12. Mini&s;ters are to teach accord|ing to People's Need and Ability to learn. It is better for them to &s;toop too low, than to &s;oar too high:&mdash; to feed Men with <HI>Milk,</HI> than to choke Children with <HI>&s;trong Meat.</HI> The Tongue of the Wi&s;e u&s;eth Knowledge aright.</P>
<P>But, if notwith&s;tanding all the Fidelity and Prudence we can u&s;e, in telling People the Truth, they will treat us as Enemies therefor, yet mu&s;t we per&s;evere in our Duty; and &s;peak GOD's Word to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: and very gladly &s;pend, and be &s;pent for their Souls, though the more abundantly we love them, the le&s;s we be loved.</P>
<P N="4">4. People &s;hould be admoni&s;hed to watch their Hearts, and not let their Affections &s;oon cool towards, and be alienated from their faithful Mini&s;ters: not to mi&s;take them for their Enemies, who tell them <HI>the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Brethren, We who&s;e Office it is to do &s;o, warn you thus, not for that we would have Dominion over your Faith, but would be Helpers of your Joy. All that we preach unto you, we would have you compare with the Standard of Truth. Search the Scriptures daily, whether tho&s;e Things we tell you are &s;o. If they agree not with the written Oracles of GOD, don't believe them, becau&s;e we &s;ay they are true; nor do them, becau&s;e we &s;ay they are good.</P>
<P>But if it be the Truth we tell you, in all the nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential Articles of it; count us not your Enemies, &s;hould we happen to oppo&s;e &s;ome By-Opinion, or fal&s;e Way of yours. And do not de&s;pi&s;e, nor reject us, be|cau&s;e we al&s;o are compa&s;&s;ed with Infirmity.</P>

Were not the Honour of their divine Ma&s;ter, and the Welfare of immortal Souls, nearly concerned in the Re|ception which good Mini&s;ters of JESUS CHRIST meet with, they would not be very &s;ollicitous about it. They don't live upon the popular Air, the Opinion and Breath of Men: but upon the Credit they have with GOD,&mdash; the Approbation which their Per&s;ons and Performances find with him. It is, on their own Account, a very &s;mall Thing with them to be judged, &mdash; de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of Men. And they don't, for their own Sake, court the People's Affections, nor complain of the Alienation thereof, from them. Did no Di&s;honour redound to CHRIST, nor Damage to the Souls of Men, they could be content to be made the Filth of the World, and Off|&s;couring of all Things, as they too much have been from the Apo&s;tles to the pre&s;ent Days: At lea&s;t, they would not &s;o often, as they now find Occa&s;ion therefor, enter &s;uch a Caution as this; which they do more out of Re|gard

<P>See to it, that the Truth of CHRIST be in you:&mdash;that you have an intimate, experimental, &s;aving Knowledge of it: Le&s;t by any Means, when you have preached it to others, you your &s;elf &s;hould be a <HI>Ca&s;t-away.</HI> Dili|gently con&s;ult the infallible Oracles of Truth: Pray for the Spirit of Truth, to lead you into all Truth: And guard again&s;t the Spirit of Error.&mdash; And the more &s;o, becau&s;e of &s;ome &s;pecial <HI>Temptation</HI> which hath hapned to you, at your fir&s;t preaching the Go&s;pel. Not only real, but meerly &s;u&s;pected Mi&s;takes in us, &s;hould be wi&s;e|ly improv'd to greater Circum&s;pection in the Study of Truth; "which is as a Vein of Silver, encompa&s;&s;ed with Earth, and mixed with Dro&s;s."

it is not many Times ea&s;y, upon little Search, to di&s;cover on which Side the Truth lies: And a &s;tiff Ad|herence to either, would (you are &s;en&s;ible) ill become a young Mini&s;ter: And wor&s;e &s;till, (which hath &s;eem'd to have been the Ca&s;e of &s;ome) an eager e&s;pou&s;ing and maintaining of the Wrong, out of a Spirit of Oppo&s;ition and Revenge. 'Tis a fooli&s;h gratifying the Jealou&s;ies of others concerning him, for a Man to depart from the Faith, that he may be at a greater Di&s;tance from them: and to verge toward Sceptici&s;m, that he may appear the more free from Bigotry. Though your Temper doth not (&s;o far as I have Knowledge of it) incline, or expo&s;e you <HI>particularly</HI> to &s;uch a Mi&s;-&s;tep, yet may you have Occa&s;ion to watch, and pray, that you enter not into <HI>Temptation.</HI></P>
<P>I have been plea&s;ed, Sir, in frequent Conver&s;ation with you, to ob&s;erve your Thir&s;t after Knowledge, and inqui|&s;itive Di&s;po&s;ition to find Truth&mdash; to prove all Things, that you might hold fa&s;t that which is good.

<P>Take heed to your Mini&s;try, that you fulfil it, in telling People the Truth&mdash;pure, unadulterated, evangelic Truth. Propo&s;e it to them in its native Plainne&s;s and Simplicity. If in your impartial, humble Enquiries after Truth, you &s;hould &s;eem to find any Thing which hath not been commonly taught and known, tell it in &s;uch fit Sea&s;on and Manner, as that it may be received, with|out Detriment to other, and perhaps more nece&s;&s;ary Parts

<P>Be valiant for the Truth again&s;t all Oppo&s;ition from the Lu&s;ts of Men, and Powers of Darkne&s;s.
