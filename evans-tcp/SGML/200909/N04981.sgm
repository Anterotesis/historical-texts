</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT <HI>Man</HI> is de&s;ign'd for <HI>Society,</HI> ap|pears from the original <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> of the human <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>WE need and de&s;ire each others <HI>A&s;|&s;i&s;tance</HI> for mutual <HI>Support, Comfort</HI> and <HI>Protec|tion;</HI> and have a <HI>Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> to communicate our <HI>Ideas</HI> to tho&s;e of our own <HI>Species,</HI> as well as <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Beneficence.</HI> The&s;e <HI>De&s;ires</HI> and <HI>Di&s;po&s;itions</HI> being <HI>common</HI> and mutual, &s;hew that we are born for <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P>OF this, mutual <HI>Love</HI> is the <HI>Band</HI> and <HI>Cement;</HI> which, unle&s;s it be pre&s;erv'd and expre&s;s'd, <HI>Soci|ety</HI> becomes a <HI>Snare</HI> and <HI>Torment,</HI> and cannot comfortably or profitably &s;ub&s;i&s;t, yea, hardly &s;ub|&s;i&s;t at all, for any long Duration: For Men, by the Neglect of its Exerci&s;e, and much more by its Contrary, will be tempted, again&s;t the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> to &s;eek a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> and independent State, in order to &s;ecure their <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> and <HI>Safety.</HI></P>
<P>AND as <HI>Love</HI> is agreeable to the Law of <HI>Na|ture,</HI> and the original <HI>Di&s;po&s;itions</HI> of the <HI>Minds</HI> of <HI>Men;</HI> &s;o, of con&s;equence, it cannot but agree with the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> the unalterable <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Practice,</HI> and the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> which is its <HI>Prototype,</HI> or original <HI>Copy</HI> and <HI>Exemplar.</HI> Hence
<PB N="4" REF="006243_0004_10281D7654AE6B18">
we are inform'd by the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> that <HI>God</HI> is <HI>Love; i. e.</HI> inclin'd to vouch&s;afe upon his <HI>Crea|tures,</HI> Acts of <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Benignity,</HI> and does not inflict <HI>Penalties,</HI> till they be as it were extort|ed by the <HI>criminal Conduct</HI> of his <HI>Creatures.</HI> Hence <HI>Judgment</HI> is repre&s;ented as <HI>his &s;trange Work;</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> his <HI>Delight.</HI></P>
<P>NOR are we only obliged to <HI>love</HI> by the com|mon <HI>Ties</HI> of <HI>Humanity,</HI> as we are <HI>Men;</HI> but likewi&s;e by the <HI>Laws</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, as we are <HI>Brethren</HI> (at lea&s;t by Profe&s;&s;ion) <HI>Children</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Father, Members</HI> of the &s;ame religious <HI>Com|munity</HI> (or Body my&s;tical) <HI>Heirs</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Hope,</HI> and <HI>Expectants</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t powerful <HI>Incentive</HI> to the <HI>Love</HI> of our <HI>Brethren,</HI> is the glorious <HI>Example</HI> of the <HI>Redeemer's Love to us,</HI> which the Apo&s;tle beauti|fully repre&s;ents in the Words of our Text, <HI>And walk in Love, as Chri&s;t al&s;o hath loved us, and hath given him&s;elf for us an Offering, and a Sa|crifice to God for a &s;weet-&s;melling Savour.</HI></P>
<P>IN the&s;e Words we may ob&s;erve an important <HI>Duty</HI> enjoin'd, <HI>Walk in Love;</HI> and a powerful <HI>Motive</HI> exciting thereto <HI>propos'd, viz.</HI> The <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to us; expre&s;s'd in the <HI>Giving of him&s;elf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice of a &s;weet-&s;melling Savour to God.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to prepare this <HI>Subject</HI> for Improve|ment, it is nece&s;&s;ary to open and explain the afore|&s;aid Particulars:</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>Duty</HI> enjoin'd, let us enquire what is imply'd in <HI>Walking in Love</HI> to our Neighbour? I an&s;wer, it implies our <HI>E&s;teem</HI> of him, for what|ever is <HI>excellent</HI> in him, either <HI>natural, acquired,</HI> or <HI>gracious.</HI> The All-wi&s;e <HI>God</HI> has di&s;pen&s;ed his
<PB N="5" REF="006243_0005_10281D796559EF78">
<HI>Gifts</HI> variou&s;ly upon the Children of Men; and that with this <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> that univer&s;al <HI>Love</HI> to our Fellow-Creatures might take place. There is none whom we conver&s;e with for &s;ome Time, but we may perceive &s;omething <HI>amiable</HI> in them, which de&s;erves our <HI>E&s;teem</HI> and <HI>Re&s;pect.</HI> O! if Mankind were as quick in Spying one another's <HI>Excellencies,</HI> as they are each other's <HI>Faults,</HI> how candid and noble wou'd it be? And how much wou'd it promote univer&s;al <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Benevolence!</HI> But alas! the contrary <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> too much prevails generally. If our Neighbour has not <HI>&s;aving Grace,</HI> which is, no doubt, the <HI>Ground</HI> of our <HI>&s;pecial Re&s;pect</HI> and Complacence, perhaps he has &s;ome <HI>moral Excellency;</HI> if not, he has at lea&s;t an <HI>immortal Soul,</HI> which, in re&s;pect of its <HI>Nature,</HI> may be &s;aid to bear the natural <HI>Image</HI> of <HI>God:</HI> But <HI>Love</HI> to our <HI>Brother</HI> does not only im|ply our <HI>E&s;teem</HI> of him, but our <HI>hearty De&s;ire</HI> after his <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Benefit</HI> in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Sen&s;e; as well as our <HI>Complacence</HI> therein, and <HI>Grief</HI> for the contrary.</P>
<P>AND this <HI>Love</HI> will doubtle&s;s manife&s;t it&s;elf in kind and <HI>courteous Speech;</HI> and, where <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> requires, and <HI>Ability</HI> admits, in <HI>beneficent Action.</HI></P>
<P>BUT more particularly, that <HI>&s;pecial Love</HI> to <HI>pious People,</HI> which the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> had chiefly in <HI>View</HI> in our <HI>Text,</HI> and which is propos'd by the <HI>Apo&s;tle John,</HI> as a <HI>Mark</HI> of true <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> has the following <HI>Properties:</HI></P>
<P>IT is <HI>&s;incere,</HI> chiefly for their Goodne&s;s and Holine&s;s:&mdash;</P>
<P>IT is <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> extending to all that we have rea&s;on to think are <HI>pious,</HI> from their <HI>Soundne&s;s</HI> in the <HI>main Principles</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> their regular <HI>Be|haviour</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="006243_0006_10281D7B08495298">
and <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with experimental <HI>Chri|&s;tianity.</HI> If our <HI>Love</HI> be confin'd to tho&s;e only who are of our <HI>Way of Thinking</HI> in every <HI>minute Point,</HI> it is not true <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>Brethren,</HI> but the &s;elfi&s;h <HI>Love</HI> of a <HI>Party</HI> or <HI>Faction.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER: <HI>Brotherly Love</HI> is <HI>proportional,</HI> &s;uited to the different <HI>Degrees</HI> of &s;piritual <HI>Good</HI> we apprehend to be in others. Such as we conceive to be more <HI>holy</HI> than others, we <HI>love</HI> them more in <HI>Degree.</HI></P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e <HI>effectual;</HI> not con&s;i&s;ting <HI>in Word, and in Tongue only, but in Deed, and in Truth.</HI></P>
<P>NOW to <HI>walk in Love,</HI> implies a <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> of <HI>Kind|ne&s;s</HI> to our <HI>Brethren,</HI> in <HI>Di&s;po&s;ition, Speech</HI> and <HI>Action;</HI> as well as our taking <HI>Pains</HI> to this End. We mu&s;tn't only <HI>begin</HI> to <HI>love</HI> them, but we &s;hould make <HI>Progre&s;s</HI> therein, and <HI>continue</HI> to the <HI>End.</HI> And truly this cannot be done without <HI>Pains:</HI> For as our <HI>Faith</HI> is <HI>try'd</HI> variou&s;ly, &s;o is our <HI>Love;</HI> and indeed it is proper it &s;hould be &s;o: For this <HI>Life</HI> is altogether a <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Trial</HI> and <HI>Probation,</HI> in order to another <HI>State</HI> after <HI>Death.</HI> Now there are three Sorts of <HI>Trials</HI> that the <HI>All|wi&s;e God</HI> is plea&s;ed &s;ometimes to &s;uffer to come in the Way of our <HI>Love, viz. Spiritual De&s;er|tion, Offences</HI> in <HI>Conduct,</HI> and <HI>Difference</HI> in <HI>Senti|ment,</HI> about the <HI>circum&s;tantial Points</HI> of <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a Child of God is long de&s;erted, his <HI>Savour</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> does of con&s;equence decline. This mu&s;t needs affect, in &s;ome Degree, his <HI>Con|ver&s;ation,</HI> and make it more <HI>un&s;avoury,</HI> and <HI>le&s;s edifying:</HI> He is, in this Situation, like a <HI>Tree</HI> in <HI>Winter,</HI> which, tho' it has <HI>Life</HI> at the <HI>Root,</HI> ap|pears, becau&s;e of its Want of <HI>Leaves</HI> and <HI>Verdure,</HI> as tho' it were quite <HI>dry</HI> and <HI>dead.</HI> Now, a <HI>Be|ginner</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="006243_0007_10281D7CAF46FB48">
in <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> who has much Joy and Comfort, and is fir'd with his fir&s;t <HI>Love,</HI> not having been try'd with <HI>Storms</HI> and <HI>Tempe&s;ts,</HI> and being, on that Account, comparatively unacquaint|ed with the <HI>Devices</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> the <HI>Depths</HI> of his own <HI>Corruption</HI> and <HI>Weakne&s;s,</HI> is apt to look upon poor de&s;erted Creatures with &s;ome Degree of <HI>Contempt,</HI> and cen&s;ure them &s;everely; and, per|haps, to judge that they have no Good in them, becau&s;e they <HI>have lo&s;t their fir&s;t Love, and fallen from their fir&s;t Works,</HI> in &s;ome Mea&s;ure. But this is exceeding <HI>cruel</HI> and <HI>barbarous!</HI> Very di&s;|plea&s;ing to <HI>God,</HI> and hurtful to Society! And &s;uch who are guilty of this Severity, if they will not, by <HI>gentle Mea&s;ures,</HI> be brought to a merciful <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Behaviour,</HI> they mu&s;t learn its Ne|ce&s;&s;ity and Excellency by <HI>broken Bones,</HI> by their own Falls and Blunders; they mu&s;t come down from their <HI>Pinacle</HI> of &s;piritual <HI>Pride</HI> one Way or other. O Sirs! let us <HI>be merciful, as our heaven|ly Father is merciful.</HI></P>
<P>BUT another <HI>Trial</HI> of our <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>Bre|thren,</HI> is <HI>Offences</HI> committed again&s;t us by them. We are all imperfect Creatures, and <HI>in many Things offend all;</HI> and therefore need each others <HI>For|bearance</HI> and <HI>Charity.&mdash;Grace</HI> is in the be&s;t, like <HI>Gold</HI> in the <HI>Ore,</HI> attended with Weakne&s;&s;es and <HI>Defects.</HI> Now <HI>Satan,</HI> who is the <HI>Accu&s;er of the Brethren,</HI> in Ca&s;e of <HI>Offence,</HI> excites us to impute it to <HI>bad De&s;ign;</HI> which much aggravates the <HI>Matter,</HI> and &s;o tends to inflame our <HI>Re&s;entments,</HI> and widen the <HI>Breach.</HI> In Oppo&s;ition hereto, it is a nece&s;&s;ary, tho' difficult Duty, <HI>To hope all Things, and believe all Things</HI> that are Good of our poor <HI>Brother;</HI> to impute his <HI>Offence</HI> to <HI>inad|vertency</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="006243_0008_10281D81B6A9C258">
or <HI>Mi&s;take,</HI> or &s;ome violent <HI>Temptation,</HI> and not to malicious Intention. This Method has a noble Tendency to &s;often Offences, and to conciliate <HI>Peace.</HI> And this Treatment we expect and de&s;ire from others, and think we are wrong'd when we get it not; and therefore we &s;hould render it to others. <HI>If our Brother offends, not only &s;even Times, but &s;eventy Times &s;even, when he repents, we &s;hould forgive him; and walk in Love, as Chri&s;t al&s;o hath loved us.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER: Another Way by which our <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>Brethren</HI> is try'd, is <HI>Differences</HI> of <HI>Opinion</HI> in the &s;maller Points of <HI>Religion.</HI> This often oc|ca&s;ions great Unea&s;ine&s;s, Heart-burnings and Di|&s;tance, tho' very unrea&s;onably. We &s;hould allow to another the &s;ame <HI>Liberty</HI> we take our&s;elves, and con&s;ider that <HI>Men</HI> can't alter their <HI>Opinions,</HI> or retain them according to their <HI>Neighbours Plea&s;ure;</HI> but mu&s;t think and believe as Things appear to them from Time to Time. Seeing that every Man has an equal Right to think for him|&s;elf; and &s;eeing that <HI>Methods</HI> of <HI>Force</HI> can't alter the <HI>Sentiments</HI> of the Mind, it is therefore un|rea&s;onable and unju&s;t; yea &s;ome Degree of <HI>Per|&s;ecution</HI> to be <HI>offended</HI> with our <HI>Brother,</HI> becau&s;e he doesn't think as we do in every Thing. And ina&s;much as our <HI>Knowledge</HI> is imperfect, as well as our <HI>Graces;</HI> and we are bid to <HI>grow in Know|ledge,</HI> as well as in <HI>Grace;</HI> we may, by the Increa&s;e of Light, be oblig'd to change our <HI>Sentiments</HI> in &s;ome <HI>circum&s;tantial Points,</HI> and to need others <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Forbearance</HI> towards us: And why then &s;hou'd we not expre&s;s it towards them? In the <HI>apo&s;tolick Times</HI> there was a Difference of <HI>O|pinion</HI> between the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Gentile Chri&s;tians</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="006243_0009_10281D833968D2B8">
about <HI>Days</HI> and <HI>Meats;</HI> the <HI>Jewi&s;h Chri&s;tians</HI> re|taining a Tincture of their Manner of <HI>Education,</HI> tho't it was &s;till nece&s;&s;ary, even in <HI>Go&s;pel Times,</HI> to ob&s;erve the <HI>ceremonial Sabboo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">hs</HI> of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Church,</HI> as well as the Difference of <HI>Meats</HI> en|joined by the <HI>ceremonial Law;</HI> and were tempt|ed to look upon the <HI>Gentile Chri&s;tians</HI> as lax and <HI>prophane,</HI> who made no <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> of &s;uch Ob&s;er|vances.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, the <HI>Gentile Chri&s;tians,</HI> not being educated in their <HI>Way,</HI> and better un|der&s;tanding the Extent of <HI>Chri&s;tian Liberty,</HI> wou'd not be bro't into <HI>Bondage</HI> by them; but their <HI>Tempers</HI> being over-heated by <HI>Debate,</HI> toge|ther with the <HI>Temptations</HI> of the <HI>Enemy,</HI> they were inclin'd, not only to cen&s;ure them as <HI>&s;uper|&s;titious,</HI> with an <HI>Air</HI> of <HI>Re&s;entment,</HI> but to con|demn their <HI>State</HI> and <HI>De&s;ign;</HI> in a Word, the <HI>Ferment</HI> of <HI>Contention</HI> ro&s;e to &s;uch a Height, a|bout the afore&s;aid <HI>circum&s;tantial Matters,</HI> that each <HI>Party</HI> were ready to un-church the other: Between them the <HI>Apo&s;tle Paul</HI> acts as a <HI>Modera|tor</HI> and <HI>Peace-maker,</HI> in the fourteenth Chapter of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans;</HI> and labours to a&s;|&s;wage the <HI>angry Flame,</HI> by proper <HI>Lenitives;</HI> he advi&s;es the &s;trong <HI>Gentile,</HI> to receive the <HI>weak Jew</HI> to Communion, or Church-Fellow&s;hip, tho' in &s;ome circum&s;tantial <HI>Errors;</HI> and not trou|ble and plague him with <HI>doubtful Di&s;putations,</HI> or <HI>Debates</HI> about le&s;&s;er Things, which are com|paratively doubtful. There is indeed a Promi&s;e <HI>that the Anointing which</HI> pious People <HI>receive, &s;hall lead them into all Truth; i. e.</HI> into all <HI>Fundamental Truth;</HI> all that <HI>Truth</HI> which is of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to <HI>Salvation;</HI> to ex|tend
<PB N="10" REF="006243_0010_10281D88287DD458">
the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> farther, will confine the true <HI>Church</HI> of Chri&s;t to one <HI>Fold,</HI> to one <HI>Pale,</HI> and perhaps to a &s;mall Number in that, which is ve|ry unrea&s;onable and uncharitable.

<P>THE <HI>Apo&s;tle Paul</HI> advi&s;es the contending <HI>Jew|i&s;h</HI> and <HI>Gentile Chri&s;tians,</HI> in the afore&s;aid Chap|ter, to ab&s;tain from de&s;pi&s;ing of and judging one another, on Account of <HI>&s;maller Differences</HI> in <HI>O|pinion.</HI> To this End he ob&s;erves, that Per&s;ons were equally <HI>&s;incere</HI> and upright on each Side of the <HI>Que&s;tion; He that regardeth a Day, regard|eth it to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the Day to the Lord, he doth not regard it:</HI> He like|wi&s;e ob&s;erves, That the Con&s;ideration of all be|ing to be judged by the great <HI>God</HI> at la&s;t, &s;hou'd incline them to avoid <HI>ra&s;h judging</HI> of each o|ther.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Argument that the Apo&s;tle u&s;es to excite them to <HI>Peace</HI> and mutual <HI>Love,</HI> is this, That the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> or <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> did not con&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e Things about which they contend|ed; <HI>The Kingdom of God,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>is not Meat and Drink, but Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t; he that in the&s;e Things &s;erveth Chri&s;t, is acceptable to God, and approved of Men. Almighty God,</HI> for wi&s;e <HI>Purpo&s;es,</HI> &s;uffers his Peo|ple to be of different <HI>Sentiments</HI> about <HI>&s;maller Points</HI> in <HI>Religion;</HI> and particularly for this, that the <HI>Truth</HI> of their <HI>Love</HI> may be brought to the <HI>Te&s;t.</HI> To have regard to tho&s;e only that are of our Way of thinking in <HI>Circum&s;tantials,</HI> while more valu|able Per&s;ons, who agree with us in the Main, are <HI>&s;lighted,</HI> becau&s;e they differ in <HI>le&s;&s;er Things;</HI> it is an Argument of a <HI>party, factious, &s;elfi&s;h Love:</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="006243_0012_10281D8CF67AB760">

<P>BUT I proceed to &s;peak of the MOTIVE excit|ing to the Duty afore&s;aid, <HI>viz.</HI> The LOVE of CHRIST to his People; <HI>As Chri&s;t al&s;o hath loved us, and given him&s;elf for us.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="006243_0013_10281D9197AE8BB8">HERE let me &s;peak of the <HI>Nature, Properties</HI> and <HI>Manife&s;tations,</HI> of CHRIST'S LOVE to his <HI>Peo|ple.</HI></P>
<P>AS to the general <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Love,</HI> I think it is commonly repre&s;ented to be, <HI>Affectus Unionis;</HI> a De&s;ire of Union with, or Nearne&s;s to the <HI>belo|ved Object;</HI> and it is Two-fold, namely, of <HI>Bene|volence</HI> and <HI>Complacency.</HI> The former &s;ignifies God's kind <HI>Intention</HI> of conferring <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>&s;pecial Benefits</HI> upon his People in <HI>Time.</HI> In this Sen&s;e, no doubt, the <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> lov'd them before the <HI>Foundations of the Earth were laid;</HI> but the latter &s;ignifies the Delight he takes in his own <HI>Image</HI> conferr'd actually on tho&s;e that fear him, in <HI>Time,</HI> and the Application of his <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> to them thro' <HI>Faith.</HI> Hence are the&s;e Ex|pre&s;&s;ions in the Song of <HI>Solomon, Thou art all fair, my Love, there is no Spot in thee; thou ha&s;t ravi&s;hed my Heart, my Si&s;ter, my Spou&s;e, with one Chain of thy Neck.</HI> The&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions &s;eem to repre&s;ent the Agreeablene&s;s of the Divine <HI>Image</HI> in his People, to the Divine <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Will;</HI> as well as the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Change in Mens <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Frame</HI> in order to <HI>Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;hould carefully ob&s;erve, that &s;uch a Love as is in us, mu&s;t not be a&s;crib'd to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as he is <HI>God;</HI> for ours is <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> and <HI>imperfect,</HI> cau&s;ing a Commotion in our Blood and Spirits; whereas his <HI>Love,</HI> as <HI>God,</HI> is a mo&s;t pure and eternal <HI>Act</HI> of his <HI>Will,</HI> whereby he wills <HI>Good</HI> to us: Yet a <HI>human Love</HI> may be properly a&s;crib'd to him, as Man, but with great Pre-eminence to ours: As <HI>Man,</HI> he has a <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Body, Will</HI> and <HI>Affections, Blood</HI> and <HI>animal Spirits,</HI> as we, but perfectly pure;

his Love is without <HI>Exce&s;s</HI> in its <HI>Tendencies,</HI> and without <HI>Tumult</HI> in its <HI>Effects;</HI> the <HI>Motions</HI> of his <HI>Will</HI> are entirely <HI>regular</HI> and <HI>calm,</HI> agreeable to right <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the Love of Chri&s;t has the following <HI>Pro|perties,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>IT is <HI>Everla&s;ting; He has loved us with an everla&s;ting Love, and therefore with loving Kind|ne&s;s has he drawn us.</HI> The Rea&s;on why any are powerfully enclin'd and enabled to believe, in Time, is, becau&s;e they were loved before it, with a Love of <HI>kind Intention.</HI> The <HI>Lord Je&s;us,</HI> the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of the <HI>Father,</HI> is repre&s;ented in the <HI>Proverbs</HI> of <HI>Solomon,</HI> as <HI>pleas'd</HI> with his <HI>De&s;igns</HI> of <HI>Mercy</HI> to|wards the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P>THE Love of Chri&s;t is <HI>free</HI> and unexcited: Our <HI>dear Lord</HI> lov'd us, when there was nothing <HI>lovely</HI> in us! When we <HI>lay in our Blood,</HI> polluted and expo&s;ed, <HI>he &s;pread the Skirt of his Affection over us, and &s;aid to us, live!</HI> Yea, <HI>when we were Ene|mies, he died for us!</HI></P>
<P>THE Love of Chri&s;t is <HI>immutable: Whom he loves, he loves to the End. He gives his Sheep eter|nal Life, and they &s;hall never peri&s;h, neither &s;hall any pluck them out of his Hand.</HI></P>
<P>THE Love of Chri&s;t, my Brethren, is <HI>incom|prehen&s;ible, it pa&s;&s;es Knowledge.</HI> Hence are the&s;e memorable Words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>And may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Height, and to know the Love of Chri&s;t, which pa&s;&s;eth Know|ledge.</HI> There was a great Love between <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jonathan; Jonathan</HI> lov'd him as his own Soul!

<P>NOW the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> manife&s;ts it&s;elf, by ma|ny Thoughts about them, and by <HI>high Thoughts</HI> of them; hence they are &s;aid <HI>to be graven on the Palms of his Hands, and &s;et as a Seal upon his Heart;</HI> and we are further told, that tho' <HI>the Mother may forget her &s;ucking Child, the Son of her Womb, yet he will not forget them;</HI> and what is &s;till more amazing! is the <HI>high Thoughts</HI> he has of his People; in which re&s;pect they are call'd his <HI>Jewels,</HI> his <HI>Trea&s;ure,</HI> his <HI>Diadem,</HI> his <HI>Joy,</HI> his <HI>Glory!</HI></P>

<P>THIS dear Lord does likewi&s;e make us <HI>comely thro' his Comeline&s;s, which he puts upon us:</HI> He makes his People all glorious within, he &s;heds a Lu&s;tre on our Souls, that out-&s;hines the Face of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when the <HI>I&s;raelites cou'd not behold him;</HI> that out-&s;hines the <HI>Sun,</HI> in his unclouded Bright|ne&s;s, and Meridian <HI>Glory.</HI></P>
<P>AND are not the Sheep of Chri&s;t, made by their deare&s;t Lord <HI>powerful?</HI> Yes, through him they have a Kind of <HI>Omnipotence!

<P>BUT <HI>Sirs,</HI> that which crowns all the divine <HI>Do|nations</HI> is, that the Love of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> gives his People an Intere&s;t in the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> of the &s;acred <HI>Trinity.</HI></P>
<P>GOD the <HI>Father</HI> is ours in all his <HI>Attributes</HI>&mdash; his <HI>Purpo&s;es</HI>&mdash;his <HI>Operations</HI>&mdash;his <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> and <HI>Providences!</HI></P>

O Miracle of Mer|cy! O inexpre&s;&s;ible Prodigy of divine Love!</P>
<P>BUT who were the&s;e for whom the ble&s;&s;ed Je|&s;us endured &s;uch intolerable Agonies? Were they Angels, or perfect Creatures? No, They were <HI>Sinners, Rebels, Enemies;</HI> &s;uch as had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his righteous Laws; &s;uch as had re|volted from the Allegiance due to his equitable Government, and &s;uch as were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a deadly Enmity again&s;t his Per&s;on and Rule; &s;uch

<P>AND tho' the Per&s;ons whom the ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us &s;et his Love upon, were &s;uch as have been de&s;cribed, yet he loved them more than the be&s;t of Men love one another; <HI>Greater Love hath no Man, than that a Man lay down his Life for his Friend; but Chri&s;t hath laid down his Life for his Enemies.</HI></P>

<P>I MAY add, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> That the dear Re|deemer <HI>loves</HI> Men more than <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth;</HI> for he left the one, and rejected the Offers of the other for his &s;ake.</P>

<P>ADD to this, that he willingly &s;uffered the Sword of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> to pierce his Heart, rather than Men &s;hould <HI>&s;uffer</HI> eternally!

<P>NAY we are, if we continue impenitent, in &s;ome <HI>Re&s;pect,</HI> more inexcu&s;able than <HI>Devils;</HI> for, &s;o far as we know, they never had an Offer of <HI>Mercy,</HI> after their <HI>Apo&s;tacy!</HI> How then <HI>&s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great Salvation?</HI> A <HI>Sal|vation</HI> purcha&s;ed by the <HI>Blood</HI> of God; a Salvati|on freely offered, and that to the very wor&s;t of Men, who will <HI>repent</HI> of their Sins and <HI>believe</HI> in Je&s;us!
