<P>WHEREAS there hath late|ly been publi&s;hed in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> a Pamphlet, Entituled, <HI>An Account of the Rea&s;ons why a con&s;iderable Number of the New North Congregation in</HI> Bo&s;ton, <HI>could not con&s;ent to Mr.</HI> Peter Thacher's <HI>Ordination there,</HI> &amp;c. In which Pamphlet are con|tained &s;everal plain and, po&s;itive Fal&s;hoods, as to Matters of Fact therein related, and many Mi&s;re|pre&s;entations of the proceedings of the &s;aid Church, in their bringing forward the choice of a Pa&s;tor to joyn with the Reverend Mr. <HI>Webb,</HI> in the work of the Mini&s;try, and in their Electing the Reverend Mr. <HI>Peter Thacher</HI> to be their Pa&s;tor, and &s;ettling him in &s;aid Office. The Fal&s;hoods and Mi&s;repre&s;entations hereby &s;pread concerning the Weighty and important Managements of &s;aid
<PB N="2" REF="002186_0003_10030CDE0D9422A0">Church, loudly calls upon us to make our D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|fence again&s;t tho&s;e who make it evident to the World, that they are endeavouring to hurt us in our be&s;t and mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>In order to our Vindication, we &s;hall recite &s;ome of the mo&s;t material pa&s;&s;ages mentioned in the &s;aid Pamphlet, relating to our Conduct, and &s;et tho&s;e proceedings of ours in a true Light.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, We find them a&s;&s;erting, That a Number of the Members of our Church did u&s;e underhand practices to Rob <HI>Weymouth,</HI> and Im|po&s;e a Mini&s;ter on <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> which thing has been much talked of, and we thought we had done enough to prevent its being improved again&s;t us any more; for at a Church Meeting, where mo&s;t of the di&s;&s;atisfyed Brethren were pre&s;ent, that mat|ter was throughly debated, and every one that could be in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected, declared they never were concerned, directly nor indirectly, by writing, or by any other means what&s;oever, to invite Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> to leave <HI>Weymouth</HI> and come to us. After the&s;e things were fairly and fully debated, it was propo&s;ed by our Reverend Pa&s;tor, that if we were in Charity with each other on that account, we &s;hould expre&s;s it by lifting up our hands, which we concluded every one did; and we challenge any per&s;on in the world to prove, that ever any of the Members of our Church have been guilty of what they have charged them with in this Affair.</P>
<P>As to what they alledge of their being fallaci|ou&s;ly dealt with (<HI>page</HI> 5, 6.) and being cut off from the benefit of a Vore we pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>13th</HI> of
<PB N="3" REF="002186_0003_10030CDE0D9422A0"><HI>May</HI> in favour of the Congregation; we &s;ay, that this one thing &s;et in a due light, we can't but think &s;ilenceth one great clamour of our Oppo|&s;ers, <HI>viz.</HI> Oppre&s;&s;ion; for this Vote was propo&s;ed and come into purely in indulgence to them, and to make them &s;en&s;ible we would do our utmo&s;t we could to quiet them and make them ea&s;y.</P>
<P>As to their being cut off from the Liberty gi|ven them in that Vote by an Obligation, which they &s;ay was tacked to it; We reply, that the obli|gation &s;o much complained of is plainly implyed in the Vote, for that is founded on the Liberty given by the Province Law to the Congregations in the Country; and the rea&s;on why the Vote was not fully compleated at this Meeting was, we could not determine the Bounds of the Congrega|tion, and therefore deferred it till we had con&s;ult|ed with &s;ome of the chief of the Congregation; and then it was determined that all the con&s;tant Hearers and Contributers &s;hould be allowed the priviledge of a Vote, that would come under &s;uch an Obligation, which was no more than only a promi&s;e, That they would do their part towards the Support of the Mini&s;try, &s;o long as God in his Providence continued them in that place, which was &s;igned by a con&s;iderable Number who did actually Vote in the Choice, and it was un|rea&s;onable and groundle&s;s Jealou&s;ies that hindered the di&s;&s;atisfy'd from coming into it.</P>
<P>As to a pretended promi&s;e made by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Webb,</HI> that they &s;hould &s;ee Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI>'s Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, &s;igned by the major part of the Church of <HI>Weymouth</HI> before we proceeded further; and that it was promi&s;ed &s;ome of the Church &s;hould go to <HI>Weymouth</HI> and bring it; We reply, that we
<PB N="4" REF="002186_0004_10030CE155AAC4A8">remember it was moved by them, but Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> an|&s;wer'd to their propo&s;al, that it was not rea&s;ona|ble nor practicable according to Cu&s;tom in &s;uch ca&s;es, but that they &s;hould &s;ee a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion in u&s;ual Form, and &s;uch a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion we according|ly produced and offered, at the time when they were called to concur with the Church in the Choice.</P>
<P>Again, we find a&s;&s;erted, (<HI>page</HI> 12.) That we cho&s;e Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> to be our Mini&s;ter when he was the Mini&s;ter of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> which we declare to be a po&s;itive Fal&s;hood; and can prove, that Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> had his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from his Pa&s;toral Relation to the Church of <HI>Weymonth</HI> by a Vote of that Church the 23d of <HI>February,</HI> 1718, 19, and that another Pa&s;tor, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas Pain,</HI> was cho&s;en both by Church and Town, and had actu|ally taken Charge of the Pulpit before Mr <HI>Thacher</HI> left them, and was ordained in his room before we made choice of him to be our Pa&s;tor which was on the <HI>9th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> 1719. And now the Church of <HI>Weymouth</HI> being &s;ettled under&s;ano|ther Pa&s;tor, they di&s;mi&s;t Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> at his de|&s;ire, as a Member, and gave him a Letter of Recommendation, wherein they &s;ay, <HI>That his Con|ver&s;ation with them had been as becometh the Go&s;pel, and that they parted with him in perfect Charity;</HI> for which there was a full Vote in the Church, and not one Per&s;on objected again&s;t it, as &s;ome of us were a&s;&s;ur'd by the pre&s;ent Reverend Pa&s;tor of that Church; tho' we find it a&s;&s;erted (<HI>page</HI> 36.) they can prove it was a lean Vote, and objections made again&s;t the Recommendation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002186_0004_10030CE155AAC4A8">
Again, We find them by way of <HI>Query (page</HI> 28.) asking, <HI>Whether Mr.</HI> Thacher <HI>did not &s;end a Letter, and charge the Church not to con&s;ent to a Council, or de&s;ire &s;ome Friend to do it for him, for &s;uch a Letter there was, and it had its Influence.</HI> This we declare to be a po&s;itive Fa&s;hood; for our Church as a Body, nor any &s;ingle Member of it, as we know of, ever received any &s;uch Letter from Mr. <HI>Thacher,</HI> or any other per&s;on in the World; nor ever had the lea&s;t hint there was &s;uch a Letter, 'till we found it a&s;&s;erted in the Pamplet.</P>
<P>There are many more Notorious Fal&s;hoods in the forenamed Pamphlet, which we think it not needful for us to an&s;wer, &s;ince we know not the Author; and tho&s;e Particulars which we have already an&s;wer'd are the foundation of the Contro|ver&s;y; and we have no pro&s;pect of its being ended, tho' we &s;hould an&s;wer every Particular.</P>
<P>And we hope no &s;erious Chri&s;tian will ju&s;tify that Pamphlet, which appears to be written with &s;o much Heat and Anger; for it's evident, that the force and &s;trength of its Rage is levelled at our Mini&s;ters; and what can the de&s;ign of this be, but to render their Labours un&s;ucce&s;sful, and pre|judice People again&s;t them? If this be their de|&s;ign, and they &s;hould in the lea&s;t obtain their end, certainly without deep Repentance and Sorrow for &s;uch Sins, dreadful mu&s;t be the Account which &s;uch per&s;ons will have to give up another Day. Our Mini&s;ters are very dear to us, and &s;ome of us can very truly, and we hope very feelingly &s;ay that we have cau&s;e to ble&s;s God for them; and we tru&s;t there are great Numbers in the Town that have a great affection for them, for the re|markable
<PB N="6" REF="002186_0005_10030CE326253E58">Meekne&s;s and Moderation they have &s;hewn in this more than ordinary Difficulty and Tryal they have met withal.</P>
<P>And whereas we find them charged with an un|becoming Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">per and Carriage in the forecited Pamphlet, in which they very particularly bid the Readers to enquire with what a Temper Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> acted upon his admi&s;&s;ion into the Church, to whom (if any &s;hould enquire) we &s;hould be glad of the opportunity to relate; Namely, That it was with great Meekne&s;s he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Church at that time; and his Expre&s;&s;ions were &s;o Chri&s;tian, and in &s;o moving a manner, as affected the greater part (we believe all, except tho&s;e few who oppo&s;ed him) and they being the per&s;ons to whom he chiefly apply'd, it was very &s;urpri&s;ing to all the the re&s;t, that they were no more affected with it.</P>
<P>They charge the Reverend Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> with parti|ality in our Meetings in reproving Sharply tho&s;e who were not of his mind, and not reproving tho&s;e who were, when they &s;pake unbecomingly; we can truly &s;ay, we Never once ob&s;erved it to be &s;o; but always to the contrary, Exhorting us all to a Chri&s;tian Temper one towards another; and when he &s;aw any thing otherwi&s;e with a great deal of meekne&s;s and moderation Admini&s;tred a reproof to one as well as to another; and in all the manage|ments of our affairs carryed it with the &s;ame tem|per to the di&s;&s;atisfyed as he did at the Meeting-Hou&s;e when the Reverend Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> was In&s;tal|led; and what his behaviour towards them was at that time and their carriage towards him, we
<PB N="7" REF="002186_0005_10030CE326253E58">leave to the many hundreds then pre&s;ent to judge. And both our Pa&s;tors have always pre&s;t it upon us to &s;tudy the things that make for peace, and to overlook whatever Ill treatment we met with from tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ented from us; and we hope we have endeavoured to ob&s;erve tho&s;e directions, and &s;till are inclined &s;o to do; and can truly &s;ay, it is and always hath been a great grie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to us, to have &s;uch a difference with any of our Bre|thren, and are willing to do any thing that lies i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our power to come to an agreement with them and to live in love and peace as becomes Brethren.</P>
