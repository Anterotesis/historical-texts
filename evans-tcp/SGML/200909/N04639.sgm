<P>IT is judged proper to acquaint you, that the en&s;uing Sheets were convey'd to the Pre&s;s, thro' a Channel who&s;e original Source is concealed from our Know|ledge. You will find the Author did not intend it for Publick View, for indeed there are &s;uch evident Marks of a Di&s;habille, and &s;uch a carele&s;s Negligence of Dre&s;s, that tho' it may be allowed to pay a <HI>Morning Vi&s;it</HI> to an intimate Friend, it was not dre&s;|&s;ed by the Writer <HI>to entertain Company,</HI> but &s;tole by a <HI>private Way, un&s;hav'd and un&s;hifted,</HI> to the <HI>Clo&s;et</HI> of his Friend. Whe|ther by the <HI>Death</HI> of its Author, or his Friend, or by <HI>what other fortuitous Turns,</HI> it at length arrived to the Pre&s;s, and now pre&s;ents it&s;elf to publick Ob&s;ervation, we cannot inform you; but that the Author is
<PB N="iv" REF="005772_0003_1026E0D9ED4A3918">ignorant of its Publication, as we are igno|rant of him or her, and that <HI>no di&s;honoura|ble Breach of Confidence</HI> has been made, there are many concurring Circum&s;tances to per|&s;uade us of.</P>
<P>Let it therefore be con&s;idered (tho' the Pre&s;s now gives it a publick Relation) <HI>as really a private Entertainment</HI> in its De&s;ign, originally given behind the Curtain of a ve|ry intimate Friend&s;hip; but <HI>Death,</HI> or <HI>&s;ome other</HI> Incidents have drawn up that Curtain, and exhibited to <HI>publick Light</HI> this <HI>private Scene</HI> of Friendly Intercour&s;e; <HI>where</HI> the Mind gives a Vent to its Feelings, without any &s;tudious elaborate Preparation; <HI>where</HI> the Sentiments flow like <HI>a natural Ca&s;cade,</HI> rudely beautiful, tho' not regularly charm|ing, with more native Impetuo&s;ity than methodical H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">mony.</P>
<P>It is neverthele&s;s apprehended, tho' the&s;e REFLECTIONS were de&s;igned only for <HI>pri|vate Entertainment and U&s;e,</HI> the Publicati|on of them may yield Plea&s;ure and Utility to the younger Part of each Sex; and may, perhaps, tend to di&s;countenance the fal&s;e, unnatural, and in&s;olent Ridicule, that fre|quently
<PB N="v" REF="005772_0004_1026E0DDD64176C8">endeavours to be&s;patter and affront the <HI>Conjugal Tie; which</HI> is, and has ever been, the &s;acred Cement of all Societies; and <HI>which</HI> has had the Approval and Vene|ration of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Minds in all Ages: The Common-place Wittici&s;ms a|gain&s;t this amiable and de&s;irable Union, are indeed &s;uch low, wretched Stuff, as to be with Indignation excluded from all polite Conver&s;ations.</P>
<P>The Author of the following <HI>Reflecti|ons,</HI> endeavours to lay <HI>a practicable Plan,</HI> by the Execution of which, the matrimonial State may produce &s;uch a Crop of Felicity, as to make it highly worthy the Pur&s;uit of every rea&s;onable and virtuous Mind. Had he wrote for publick View, he would pro|bably have appeared in a more full and re|gular Dre&s;s, &mdash; but that has already been a|pologized for. We &s;hall only therefore de|clare our Opinion, that his Plan carries Rea&s;on and Conviction with it; and might perhaps more fully have done &s;o, had he con&s;ider'd his Subject by Way of <HI>Contra&s;t,</HI> as forcibly as he has in the Ab&s;tract: For whoever has ob&s;erv'd the declining Days of

What exqui&s;ite Sen&s;ations this Patriarchal Brea&s;t mu&s;t feel! What heavenly Raptures his Soul mu&s;t glow with! MATRIMONY may, upon our Author's Plan, acquaint us with them. &mdash; But the&s;e divine Supports are as
<PB N="vii" REF="005772_0006_1026E0E36F944C40">little to be expected by an <HI>Old Batchelor,</HI> as in our Power to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Our Author's <HI>Reflections</HI> may furthermore convince the Fair Sex, <HI>that</HI> tho' Fortune may buy them a mercenary Tyrant; tho' Beauty may provoke their Ruin, or attract &s;ome Fop or Coxcomb; yet. <HI>Good Sen&s;e,</HI> and <HI>real</HI> Merit only, will touch the <HI>Heart</HI> of, and maintain their <HI>Influence</HI> over, Men of true Worth and Knowledge: <HI>That</HI> the Charms of Judgment, Di&s;cretion and good Temper, are the only <HI>la&s;ting</HI> Foundations upon which matrimonial Felicity can be built: <HI>That</HI> the Cultivation of their Minds is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Production of their Happine&s;s; <HI>that</HI> Love will &s;oon &s;tarve without Friend&s;hip; and finally, <HI>that</HI> the Standard of human Felicity in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> is the PRACTICE OF WISDOM AND <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;o al&s;o of the Conjugal Union in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"></P>

<HEAD>REFLECTIONS ON COURTSHIP <HI>and</HI> MARRIAGE. LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>_YOU tell me the Di&s;pute which was carried on in our Company the other Day, has rather made you a <HI>Sceptick to both,</HI> than a <HI>Convert to either</HI> Side of the Que&s;tion: And you de&s;ire my deliberate Sentiments on the Subject of that Afternoon's Argument.</P>
<P>YOU have an unque&s;tionable Right to a&s;k me: I wi&s;h my An&s;wer may prove &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>MARRIAGE, you know, was the Topick of our Conver&s;ation, and the Subject of our Di&s;pute. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="2" REF="005772_0009_10270B7ED86FEBA0">Schemes of that kind on his Hands; and was therefore &s;o far unbia&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>YOU may remember many &s;prightly Things were &s;aid again&s;t that Scene of Life; &s;ome very plau&s;ible Ones.</P>
<P>IT was alledged, on the one Hand, that the Edu|cation of Women, in general, mu&s;t naturally give them a &s;trong Bia&s;s to <HI>Di&s;&s;embling</HI> and <HI>Affectation,</HI> the Turn of Thinking, which, for the mo&s;t Part, they <HI>early</HI> imbibe; the too much <HI>Attention,</HI> and <HI>Artifice</HI> they are taught to be&s;tow on their <HI>Per&s;ons;</HI> the trifling, and often ill-judged Accompli&s;hments, by which their Ambition is excited, and in which, for the mo&s;t Part, they &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavour to excel.</P>
<P>BY this Method of Management they are poli&s;hed to a <HI>&s;uperficial Lu&s;tre,</HI> dazle our Sight, and work up our Pa&s;&s;ions. But, for that End, the <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> Culture of their <HI>Minds</HI> is gro&s;ly neglected; <HI>true</HI> good Sen&s;e, and <HI>&s;ound</HI> Judgment; the ine&s;timable Per|fections of a <HI>generous,</HI> an <HI>open,</HI> and <HI>noble</HI> Mind, are but little con&s;idered in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">tions.</P>
<P>HEREBY are they quite unfitted for the <HI>delicate Plea&s;ures</HI> of a <HI>rational E&s;teem</HI> and the Godlike Joys of a manly Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>NOT having therefore the requi&s;ite Fund of <HI>&s;ub|&s;tantial Worth</HI> to rai&s;e the Thought, and touch the Heart; to be an agreeable Companion, and a &s;teady Friend; and only &s;triking the Springs of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Appetite;</HI> when <HI>tho&s;e</HI> are deaden'd, as they naturally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> be by Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the Joys of Wedlock grow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>in&s;ipid,</HI> &s;icken and die away, leaving us in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">oom, a vain and capricious, and empty and
<PB N="3" REF="005772_0010_10270B8343770DF0">in&s;ignificant Companion, with perhaps a helple&s;s Infant or two, to increa&s;e our Care and Vexation.</P>
<P>IS there, was it a&s;ked, any thing &s;o engaging, &s;o eligible in this &s;ocial Scheme of Life, as to induce a Man of Sen&s;e and Judgment to embrace it; to quit for it, the free, the ea&s;y and independent Plea&s;ures of a &s;ingle Life; where, cool and unmole&s;ted, he ex|alts and improves his Under&s;tanding in the Trea&s;ures of ancient and modern Learning; un&s;hackled from the Cares of a Family; unclogg'd by that perplexing Chain, a petulant, or a weak, or a fanta&s;tick Wife, relaxes him&s;elf with the agreeable Conver&s;ation of polite, chearful, and witty Companions.</P>
<P>IS there, was it added, any Compari&s;on between the two Scenes of Life?</P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved by the Advocates on this Side of the Que&s;tion, that a debauched, di&s;&s;olute Life, was not pleaded for; but that there was a <HI>ju&s;tifiable Mean</HI> betwixt <HI>both Extreams,</HI> more choice-worthy than <HI>either,</HI> and which a Man of Prudence and Di&s;cretion might hit upon.</P>
<P>AND here, you may remember, a Gentleman in Company, &s;poke to the following Purpo&s;e:</P>
<Q><P>THE De&s;cription which has been given of the Education of our Modern young Ladies, and its <HI>malignant Influence,</HI> is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, but too ju&s;t, and too general. And tho' many, in Pictures of this Kind, often di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">ver too much Coar&s;ene&s;s in their Paint, yet, I think, this has been touched as becomes the Hand of a Gentleman, and one that de&s;ires to rea&s;on, not inveigh.</P>
<P>THE Inferences which throw them&s;elves on us by the Que&s;tions a&s;ked, have great Plau&s;ibility,
<PB N="4" REF="005772_0011_10270B86E9D4E490">and, generally con&s;idered, carry with them a Weight, near, and almo&s;t, to Conviction.</P>
<P>BUT, Gentlemen, I wou'd beg Leave to ob|&s;erve, that tho' the common Education of young Ladies is chiefly extended no father than to <HI>&s;uper|ficial</HI> and <HI>exterior</HI> Accompli&s;hments; and that their Behaviour is rather owing to a Sort of mechanical Influence, than to Sentiments from Rea&s;on and Judgment; that <HI>Reading,</HI> and <HI>Reflection</HI> are too much neglected by them, or ill regulated; that their Ta&s;te of <HI>real Worth</HI> and <HI>Merit</HI> in Men and Things, is thereby render'd very defective, and often &s;hows it&s;elf to be mighty ridiculous; that their Pa&s;&s;ions are rather kept under Re&s;traint by the common Rules of Decorum, than by any ra|tional Conviction of a <HI>real beautiful,</HI> and <HI>deformed</HI> in Characters, independant on <HI>who &s;ees,</HI> or <HI>who knows;</HI> that they aim more to catch the Eyes, than penetrate the Heart, to blow up the Pa&s;&s;ions, than to &s;ecure the Under&s;tandings of their Admi|rers; that E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip are more remote from their Attention, than frothy Compliments and foppi&s;h Rant.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all this, I conceive, Gentlemen, where the Di&s;po&s;itions of a young Lady are not of a bad Turn by Nature, whatever little Weeds may be &s;prung or &s;pringing up from the unhappy Influence of her Education, are to be cleared; her Mind and Temper &s;till ca|pable of &s;uch Cultivation by a &s;kilful Addre&s;s, as to render her very worthy E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip to a Man of Sen&s;e, worthy his Choice, as a Com|panion for Life.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded no one in this Company will
<PB N="5" REF="005772_0012_10270B8886361E50">a&s;&s;ert, Women are by Nature con&s;tituted incapable of Friend&s;hip, or any &s;ocial Charms which our Sex po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Every Per&s;on here is better ver&s;ed in Hi&s;tory and human Nature.</P>
<P>WHAT then &s;hould ob&s;truct their &s;hining in &s;o exalted a Light?&mdash;Why Education, the trifling and narrow Extent of Thinking which that ac|cu&s;toms them to, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BUT in young Minds, for of &s;uch only I &s;peak, where there are common, docile and pliable, Di&s;po|&s;itions, Is it an in&s;uperable Ta&s;k to rai&s;e in them an Ambition for good Sen&s;e, and a judicious Ta&s;te? There are many Pa&s;&s;ions to work upon, which a <HI>nice</HI> and <HI>gentle</HI> Hand may manage to his Purpo&s;e; there are the Seeds of Reflection, and tho' they may lie under Rubbi&s;h, 'tis to be cleared away; they may be &s;own in good Ground, and by mind|ing Times and Sea&s;ons, and dealing tenderly with them, they will bring forth a Crop of happy and u&s;eful Reflections.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uffer me, Gentlemen, to go yet farther. Allowing what we have &s;aid on the Education of young Ladies to be all true; do not our Sex too often compleat what that has begun? do we not in general flatter them with a Heap of bomba&s;t Stuff, and then laugh at them for &s;eeming plea&s;ed with it? Do we not blow up their Vanity and Con|ceit, with Notions of that Merit to which they have no ju&s;t Title? And glo&s;s over their &s;illy Airs and Follies with fal&s;e Applau&s;e, and Epithets of Ap|probation? Do we not generally conver&s;e with them in a Language of Rhodomontade and Non&s;en&s;e?</P>
<P>How then, is it po&s;&s;ible for them to improve; How to di&s;cern <HI>real</HI> from <HI>fal&s;e</HI> Excellence, who
<PB N="6" REF="005772_0013_10270B8A7351EC98">&s;eldom hear a Word of Sen&s;e, and le&s;s of Truth? 'Tis this Sort of Treatment young Ladies meet with in common Life, and too much of this Kind we carry with us when we make our matrimonial Addre&s;&s;es; to which, and our &s;ub&s;equent Impru|dences after Marriage, I cannot but a&s;cribe the many ju&s;t Satires that are thrown out again&s;t it.</P></Q>
<P>'BUT wou'd we'&mdash;Here the Di&s;cour&s;e was interrupted by a Circum&s;tance which I doubt not you well remember.</P>
<P>HAD the Gentleman proceeded, your Opinion might po&s;&s;ibly have been determined, and pre|vented me an Attempt, for which I fear I am not &s;ufficiently qualified.&mdash;However I will not add to the Trouble of your Peru&s;al any further Apologies, which are in general the Effects more of Vanity than Mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>I am then of that Gentleman's Opinion, who&s;e Di&s;cour&s;e was broke in upon:</P>
<P>THAT unhappy Matches are often occa&s;ioned by meer <HI>mercenary Views</HI> in <HI>one</HI> or <HI>both</HI> of the Parties; or by the <HI>head&s;trong</HI> Motives of <HI>ill conducted Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>THAT by a <HI>prudent</HI> and <HI>judicious</HI> Proceeding, in our Addre&s;&s;es to a young Lady of a good natural Temper, a probable Foundation may be laid for making her an agreeable Companion, a &s;teady Friend, and a good Wife.</P>
<P>AND that after Marriage, by continuing in the Road of <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> we may erect a Super&s;tructure of as much <HI>real Felicity,</HI> and as refined an Enjoyment of Life, to its late&s;t Period, as any other Scheme can ju&s;tly lay claim to.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give you my deliberate Thoughts on the&s;e four Particulars; the <HI>fir&s;t, &s;econd</HI> and <HI>third,</HI> will be
<PB N="7" REF="005772_0014_10270B8F20DE46B0">the Subject of <HI>this,</HI> the <HI>fourth</HI> that of <HI>another Letter;</HI> and, to be le&s;s confu&s;ed, I &s;hall put them under a Sort of Method.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> Many unhappy Matches are occa&s;ioned by <HI>mer|cenary Views</HI> in <HI>one</HI> or <HI>both</HI> of the <HI>Parties.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT <HI>Luxury,</HI> and an expen&s;ive Manner of Life, is not le&s;s the Attention than the Ambition of mo&s;t People in their &s;everal Cla&s;&s;es; and that &s;uch a Turn of Mind mu&s;t naturally and nece&s;&s;arily carry with it a violent and in&s;atiable Thir&s;t for Riches; to any Per&s;on of Ob&s;ervation and Reflection, is as obvious, on the one Hand, as 'tis con&s;equential on the other.</P>
<P>'Tis as certain, that a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o prevalent, will, of Cour&s;e, weigh down and &s;tifle every noble, ge|nerous, and di&s;intere&s;ted Sentiment.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee but too often, like a de&s;tructive Torrent, it hurries away all the Principles of Humanity, Friend&s;hip and Honour.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort&mdash;whenever <HI>Luxury,</HI> and an Ambition for <HI>Show</HI> and <HI>Grandeur,</HI> become our <HI>ruling Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> the <HI>Love of Money,</HI> as being the nece&s;&s;ary Means for attaining the other, will be proportionably &s;trong: And whatever be our <HI>ruling Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> it will &s;wallow up all the re&s;t, and be the <HI>governing Principle</HI> of our Actions.</P>
<P>A great Philo&s;opher, and a Poet, that has, I think, no Equal in our Language, tell us,
<Q><PB N="8" REF="005772_0015_10270B90B7385E28">
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pope's Epi&s;t, to Lord <HI>Bathur&s;t.</HI></NOTE> The ruling Pa&s;&s;ion, be it what it will,</L>
<L>The ruling Pa&s;&s;ion conquers Rea&s;on &s;till.</L></Q></P>
<P>EVERY Man of Ob&s;ervation and Thought does, I believe, find, that <HI>exterior Show,</HI> and the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Wealth, is become the common Standard of Merit; that a <HI>&s;lavi&s;h Ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is paid to it, at the Expence of all that is <HI>truly Great and Manly.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ame <HI>little, &s;neaking,</HI> and <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Spirit, is crept into our matrimonial Pur&s;uits; and not, I think, le&s;s with the Fair than our own Sex.</P>
<P>WHAT abominable <HI>Pro&s;titutions</HI> of Per&s;ons and Minds are daily to be &s;een in many of our Marriages! How little a Share has <HI>real Friend&s;hip</HI> and <HI>E&s;teem</HI> in mo&s;t of them! How many <HI>play the Harlot,</HI> for a good Settlement, under the <HI>legal Title</HI> of a Wife! And how many the <HI>Stallion,</HI> to repair a broken For|tune, or to gain one.</P>
<P>ARE the&s;e <HI>Muckworms</HI> to expect any <HI>&s;ocial Happine&s;s</HI> with each other? &s;hall their <HI>wretched Experi|ence</HI> be quoted as In&s;tances to prove Matrimony unworthy our Choice?</P>
<Q><L><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Watts</HI> (a Memoria)</NOTE> As well two Mountains of Peru might meet,</L>
<L>And mix their Dro&s;s, to make a Bondage &s;weet.</L></Q>
<P>THE real Felicity of Marriage does undoubtedly con&s;i&s;t in a <HI>Union of Minds,</HI> and a <HI>Sympathy of Af|fections;</HI> in a <HI>mutual E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip</HI> for each other in the highe&s;t Degree po&s;&s;ible. But in that Alliance, where Intere&s;t and Fortune <HI>only</HI> is con&s;i|dered, tho&s;e refined and tender Sentiments are nei|ther felt or known. And what are they exchanged
<PB N="9" REF="005772_0016_10270B94F8AF2390">for? Why, to make a Glare in the Eyes of the little and great Vulgar; to be hurried thro' Scenes of ridi|culous and treacherous Ceremony; to rai&s;e Envy in the weak and &s;illy Part of the World, Pity and Con|tempt in the Wi&s;e and Judicious.</P>
<P>AND what are the Con&s;equences to the Parties them&s;elves?

<P>IF the Happine&s;s of a married Life does, as it mo&s;t certainly <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> ari&s;e from an <HI>unfeigned E&s;teem,</HI> and <HI>&s;incere Friend&s;hip</HI> for each other; how is it po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch <HI>godlike Effects</HI> of flow from &s;uch <HI>diabolical Cau&s;es,</HI> as <HI>avaricious, mercenary,</HI> and <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Views?

<P>To conclude, 'tis a Truth of the plaine&s;t Demon|&s;tration, that <HI>Slaves to Fortune,</HI> or the Gratification of their own &s;elfi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions, who center their Views in Life within them&s;elves, independant on the Foel|ings of others, are <HI>incapable</HI> of a &s;incere and &s;teady

<P>DOES it not then very evidently appear, that Mar|riages which are made on the meer Motives of Inte|re&s;t, will naturally turn out, in&s;ipid, unhappy, and <HI>fatal</HI> Situations.</P>
<P>IF there can be found any In&s;tances to the con|trary, they mu&s;t be owing to a happy Chance; tho&s;e who in &s;o important an Engagement will tru&s;t to a <HI>Fors Fortuna</HI> for their Happine&s;s, are not worth rea&s;oning with. 'Tis true, we cannot arrive to Cer|tainty in human Contingencies, but when Rea&s;on, and the greate&s;t Degree of Probability are again&s;t us, 'tis Madne&s;s, 'tis egregious Folly, to act in Contra|diction to them.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t not be inferred from the foregoing, that Prudence and Di&s;cretion with Regard to Fortune are to be bani&s;h'd from our Con&s;ideration. That wou'd be an Extream, on the other Hand, equally, or more &s;ubver&s;ive of our Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>To talk of a Competence, is, in Effect, &s;aying Nothing at all; what may be &s;o to one Man, is not &s;o to another. But this is certain: The nearer we bring our De&s;ires of Living, and our Reli&s;hes of Plea&s;ure, to the Nece&s;&s;ities of our Nature, the more ea&s;y and certain will our Happine&s;s be: And un|doubtedly Splendor and Magnificence, are more <HI>imaginary</HI> than <HI>real</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Ingredients to hu|man Felicity.</P>
<P><HI>How much,</HI> or <HI>how little</HI> or Fortune will content us, depends chiefly on our own Way of Thinking.

<P>THE old People &s;trike the <HI>Bargain;</HI> the young Ones are mad and light-headed with tho&s;e ravi&s;hing Scenes their warm Con&s;titutions and di&s;tempered Fancies pre&s;ent to their View.</P>
<P>WELL, they are married, and have taken their Full of Love.

<P>BESIDES, in Marriages of this Kind, there is nei|ther <HI>Time</HI> nor <HI>Coolne&s;s</HI> &s;ufficient, for fixing an E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip; and therefore the very <HI>Foundations</HI> for its <HI>la&s;ting</HI> Happine&s;s are wanting.

That Court&s;hip brings on Marriage, and that makes all the Peace and Welfare of our Lives dependant on the Behaviour and Di&s;po&s;itions of another; a Matter of the <HI>utmo&s;t</HI> Con&s;equence, and of which we cannot well think too long or too much. Let not therefore our <HI>Eyes</HI> or <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> pre|vail with us, to barter away all that is truly valuable in our Exi&s;tence for <HI>their</HI> Gratification.</P>

<P>IT has been already ob&s;erved, that LOVE con&s;idered meerly as a Pa&s;&s;ion, will naturally have but a &s;hort Duration; like all other Pa&s;&s;ions 'tis changeable, tran&s;ient and accidental. But Friend&s;hip and E&s;teem are derived from Principles of Rea&s;on and Thought, and when once truly fixed in the Mind, are la&s;ting Securities of an Attachment to our Per&s;ons and For|tunes; participate with, and refine all our Joys; &s;impathize with, and blunt the Edge of every ad|ver&s;e Occurrence.&mdash;In vain &s;hould I endeavour to make an Elogium on true <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> in any Mea|&s;ure equal to its &s;ublime and exalted Value: There is no Good in Life comparable to it; neither are any, or all of its other Enjoyments worth de&s;iring without it.

<P>NOR, on Examination, do I perceive any Thing in my Scheme too refined, or any ways impracti|cable, to a Man that unites in him&s;elf a <HI>good Head</HI> with a <HI>good Heart;</HI> a Character, under which an improving and grateful Experience has te&s;tified you to my Acquaintance and Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>VICIOUS Minds and coar&s;e Under&s;tandings, might, perhaps, laugh at the&s;e Things as chimeri|cal, and too fine &s;pun for Practice. Whatever your Opinion may be, I re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that neither Goodne&s;s of Judgment, nor Delicacy of Ta&s;te will be wanting to direct it.</P>
<P>YOU will con&s;ider it as the private Te&s;timony of one Friend, to the Reque&s;t of another.

<P>I &s;hall only add, that in my pre&s;ent Way of thinking, whenever I am inclined to pay my Court|&s;hip to any Lady, it will be very much in the Way I have mentioned: I &s;ay, in &s;ome &s;uch Manner.</P>

<P>You may perhaps think me guilty of an Omi&s;|&s;ion in the foregoing Reflections, in having &s;aid nothing with regard to the <HI>Con&s;ent of Parents.</HI> I &s;hall therefore deliver you my Opinion in relation thereto as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THAT there is a certain <HI>Authority</HI> lodged in Parents over their Children, and in con&s;equence thereof, a certain <HI>Obedience</HI> due from Children to their Parents, are Truths derived from Nature, and founded in Rea&s;on, and have had the Concurrence of all Ages and all Nations.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory gives us In&s;tances of this Obedience paid to Parents, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Characters of Antiquity; and even in re&s;pect of Marriage, as you may remember in the Life of CYRUS the Great.</P>
<P>WE have likewi&s;e many pa&s;t and living Ex|amples, where the Authority of Parents over their Children in Marriages, has been mo&s;t tyrannically and fatally exerted.</P>
<P>WITHOUT entering into a Train of Rea&s;oning, I may venture to take it for granted;</P>
<P>THAT no parental Authority, that is <HI>repugnant</HI> to the Dictates of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> or (which is the &s;ame Thing) the <HI>moral Happine&s;s</HI> of our Na|tures, is any ways binding on Children.</P>
<P>To marry without a <HI>Union of Minds,</HI> a Sympa|thy of Affections, a mutual E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip for each other, is contrary to Rea&s;on and Virtue, the Moral Happine&s;s of our Natures.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="005772_0035_10270BCFA4F5DA60">
IT follows therefore that no parental Authority, thus to make our&s;elves unhappy by marrying, is any ways binding on Children.</P>
<P>To marry with a Union of Minds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being therefore agreeable to Rea&s;on and Virtue, and the Moral Happine&s;s of our Natures; 'tis evident that Parents have no Authority, founded in Truth or Nature, to hinder their Children from &s;o doing.</P>
<P>THO' the&s;e Propo&s;itions, and the Inferences drawn from them, are, I believe, ju&s;t and true; yet Children &s;hould undoubtedly be <HI>extreamly ten|der</HI> in thwarting the Wills of their Parents: Should be <HI>very careful,</HI> that their <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> do not <HI>blind,</HI> or their <HI>Caprice mi&s;lead</HI> them: Should with great Calmne&s;s and Impartiality rea&s;on with them&s;elves: Appeal to their Parents, with great Deference and Humility: Con&s;ult with &s;ome wi&s;e and unbia&s;&s;ed Friend: De&s;ire their Interpo&s;ition. In &s;hort, do every Thing in their Power to convince and per|&s;uade; and nothing but a manife&s;t and con&s;cious Violation of Rea&s;on and their real Happine&s;s, &s;hould force them to oppo&s;e or di&s;obey the Will of their Parents; e&s;pecially to &s;uch as have ever behaved kindly, carefully and friendly to them: They have the <HI>greate&s;t Authority</HI> over Children, that one Mortal <HI>can have</HI> over another.</P>
<P>How far it may be our <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> to obey or not, is a|nother Con&s;ideration. What has been &s;aid on the Ar|ticle of mercenary Views, may &s;erve to determine us.</P>
<P>I conclude with the Lines of an anonymous Author,
<Q><L>Let no dire Threats, no kind Entreaties move,</L>
<L>To give thy Per&s;on where thou can&s;t not love.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. I. Prerogative</HI> and <HI>Dominion</HI> in Marriage, are often Matters of Di&s;pute in Conver|&s;ations; but more frequently the Cau&s;es of Animo&s;ity and Unea&s;ine&s;s to the Par|ties them&s;elves.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cu&s;toms of different Nations have car|ried, and the Sentiments of many People do carry the&s;e Points <HI>much too high,</HI> and with a Seve|rity as unrea&s;onable as unju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>WHATEVER <HI>tyrannick</HI> and <HI>arbitrary Power</HI> the Laws of a Country may give a Man over his Wife, or &s;hould they do the rever&s;e, there is no &s;uch Kind of Dominion derived from <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>MARRIAGE, in my Sen&s;e of it, is a certain voluntary and mutual Contract between the Sexes, the End or De&s;ign of which is, or &s;hould be, their joint Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>'Tis therefore ab&s;urd and ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e or conclude, that either Party do thereby con&s;ent or bind them&s;elves over to an <HI>imperious</HI> or <HI>tyranni|cal Sway.</HI></P>
<P>IT follows therefore that Marriage, does neither by the Laws of Nature or Rea&s;on, give either Par|ty a tyrannick and arbitrary Power over the other; and that the Exerci&s;e of &s;uch a Power, is contrary to the Will and Happine&s;s of any rational Being;
<PB N="31" REF="005772_0038_10270BD7A032E798">and mu&s;t in con&s;equence render a matrimonial Life uncomfortable and mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>To me there &s;eems no other Standard of Obedi|ence, than REASON and PRUDENCE; in which I am &s;upported by the learned and judicious Mr. <HI>Woola&s;ton,</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rel. of Nat.

<P>THIS certainly is to put the Affair on a right Footing.</P>
<P>Now the foregoing Ob&s;ervations on Court&s;hip pre&s;uppo&s;e, and indeed plainly determine, a &s;uperior Degree of Knowledge and Under&s;tanding in the Man: Con&s;equently derives to him that Deference and Submi&s;&s;ion which is a&s;&s;igned by Mr. <HI>Woola&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>REALLY <HI>Nature</HI> and the Circum&s;tances of hu|man Life, &s;eem to de&s;ign for Man that Superiori|ty, and to inve&s;t him with a directing Power in the more difficult and important Affairs of Life.</P>
<P>WHERE this &s;uperior Capacity is not fixt in the Man, and that incumbent Subordination made a Rule of Conduct by the Woman, I &s;hould greatly mi&s;tru&s;t the Happine&s;s of their Condition. It mu&s;t certainly break in upon our Scheme of Felicity, which &s;uppo&s;es the former, and prepares the mo&s;t probable Means for the latter, by fixing a Friend|&s;hip and E&s;teem in the Woman, for the Mind and Under&s;tanding of the Man.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="005772_0039_10270BD939D870F0">

<P>ALL this is no le&s;s the <HI>Duty,</HI> than the <HI>Prudence</HI> of a married Man.</P>
<P>IF on the contrary, he is pu&s;&s;ed up with extra|vagant and ridiculous Notions of his Prerogative; fond of &s;howing and exerting on every little Oc|ca&s;ion a formal and magi&s;terial Authority, to which <HI>little Minds</HI> are very &s;ubject: No wonder then, if Contention and Animo&s;ity are often their matrimonial Entertainment.</P>
<P>A Man of Sen&s;e and Breeding, will be as it were &s;uperior, without &s;eeming to know it; and &s;upport his Influence with &s;o great a Delicacy, that his Wife &s;hall ever &s;eem to be his Equal, make u&s;e of a thou&s;and polite Methods even to elevate her Character. What an amiable and engaging Scene mu&s;t &s;uch a Couple exhibit! How <HI>firm</HI> their <HI>Union!</HI> and how <HI>harmonious</HI> their Lives!</P>
<P>BUT how often where Court&s;hip has been ill
<PB N="33" REF="005772_0040_10270BDBD96E3930">managed, and Marriage wor&s;e directed, do we &s;ee the <HI>Rever&s;e</HI> of that <HI>lovely Scene?</HI></P>

In &s;hort, for want of Delicacy, Judgment and Temper, 'tis the con&s;tant Struggle of their Lives, to try, as the vulgar Proverb has it, <HI>who &s;hall wear the Breeches.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude: Let us, who aim at being <HI>truly Happy</HI> in Marriage, take the proper Steps in our Court&s;hip for convincing the Lady, that we are be&s;t capable of directing and judging in the impor|tant Concerns of Life; and after Marriage, u&s;e the proper Methods to a&s;certain that Privilege.</P>

<P>THE reproving each other before Company, and <HI>&s;parring</HI> as it were together, is mighty wrong, and very unpolite; it irritates them&s;elves, and makes their Company very unea&s;y.</P>

'Tis no extraordinary Paradox, that a Man may him&s;elf de|bauch his own Wife; and a Woman harlotize with her own Hu&s;band.&mdash;But this Subject mu&s;t be touched with great Nicety; therefore I &s;hall only add, that even our <HI>mo&s;t unob&s;erved</HI> Behaviour, &s;hould carry with it &s;uch a Spirit of Refinement, as to pre|vent that vulgar and libidinous Degeneracy, which will infallibly blunt the Edge of our Joys, and in the End pall our Reli&s;h.</P>

<P>THAT ju&s;t Remark (in <HI>Page</HI> 35) of <HI>Ben. John|&s;on's,</HI> and Dean <HI>Swift</HI>'s witty Saying, which I quo|ted under the former Section, are very applicable here.</P>
<P>MANY more judicious Authorities I might add, to impre&s;s the great Prudence and Nece&s;&s;ity of this Oeconomy and Cleanline&s;s of Per&s;on and Dre&s;s after Marriage; for which, the inimitable SPECTATORS, TATLERS, and GUARDIANS, are among others great and zealous Patrons. There is an admirable Letter
<PB N="40" REF="005772_0047_10270BEF9AEEFD30">of the very ingenious Dean <HI>Swift's,</HI> to a new mar|ried young Lady, in which this very Thing is warm|ly recommended: The whole of it is wrote with &s;o mach Judgment, good Sen&s;e, and fine Sprit, and &s;o well adapted to my De&s;ign, that I &s;hall give you a Copy of it at the Clo&s;e.</P>
<P>TO a Man of any Delicacy, and even moderate Neatne&s;s, nothing certainly is more odious and un|grateful, than a <HI>&s;latternly</HI> and <HI>uncleanly Woman:</HI> 'Tis enough to quell his &s;tronge&s;t Pa&s;&s;ions, and damp every fond and tender Emotion: 'Tis va&s;tly more &s;o in a Wife, than a Stranger, (for as to <HI>meer Per&s;on,</HI> the Keenne&s;s of Inclination is (I &s;uppo&s;e) general|ly le&s;s, <HI>after</HI> than <HI>before</HI> full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) Therefore a <HI>&s;lovenly</HI> and <HI>unfragrant One,</HI> in a Wife, mu&s;t na|turally run a great Ri&s;que of weakning, if not ex|tingui&s;hing De&s;ire. Be&s;ides 'tis an In&s;ult upon a Man's Ta&s;te, an Affront to his Sen&s;es, and bullying him to his No&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS Negligence and Dirtine&s;s of Per&s;on, (if we expect or de&s;ire a Man to love us at the &s;ame Time) is taxing him with the Want of his Sen&s;es, with the Ta&s;te and Appetite of a Hog, who&s;e Joy is Filth.</P>

God help his Stomach! This is the real Pourtrait of many married Women, and the piteous Ca&s;e of many a poor Soul of a Hu&s;band; unle&s;s when happily &s;ome Stranger is expected, then Madam takes care to appear clean, and there|by convinces her Hu&s;band, &s;he is more anxious to plea&s;e a Stranger than the Man who has cho&s;en her as his Companion for Life.</P>
<P>EXCUSE my Prolixity and Warmth on this un|&s;avoury Article: I know your Temper, and my own corre&s;ponds with it. I am convinced this want of Decency and Cleanline&s;s, is the ori|ginal Source of many Peoples Unhappine&s;s in Marriage.</P>
<P>A con&s;tant Care and Study to pre&s;erve the <HI>Oeco|nomy</HI> and <HI>Sweetne&s;s</HI> of Dre&s;s and Per&s;on, mu&s;t be of great Service to &s;upport Love and E&s;teem in Wedlock.</P>

<P>THAT as Prince <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> (to carry on the Simi|litude) mu&s;t act by a Sort of Vicegerency or De|putation, and that Honour, by the Rules of Ju|&s;tice, and for the Good of the Whole, ought un|doubtedly to fall on the mo&s;t capable and expe|perienced, which by our Scheme the Man will be&mdash;All Rebellion again&s;t this Vicegerent, whil&s;t he acts in the Character of his Prince <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> is extreamly wrong and undutiful; has a fatal Tendency to &s;ubvert the Tranquility and Or|der of the matrimonial State:&mdash;But we will leave the&s;e Politicks, and come to the Subject in hand.</P>
<P>WE ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, that the Well-being of Marriage, as of all other Societies, aro&s;e from a Harmony and Corre&s;pondence of its &s;everal Parts to their re&s;pective Ends and Relations.</P>
<P>THIS fundamental Truth has been hitherto con|&s;idered chiefly as it relates to the <HI>internal Charac|ters</HI> of the Conjugates: We &s;hall now apply it to tho&s;e practical ones which ari&s;e from the Manage|ment of <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> or <HI>Fortune,</HI> and what is called <HI>Hou&s;ewifery.</HI></P>
<P>THAT Part of Management which belongs to the pre&s;erving our Intere&s;t, or improving our For|tune, u&s;ually falls, and very properly, on the Man. And 'tis unque&s;tionably incumbent on him, if he be a Man of E&s;tate, and independant on any Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, to regulate his Equipage, his private and fa|mily
<PB N="45" REF="005772_0052_10270BFD57E6D5E0">Expences, according to the Income of his For|tune; and 'tis certainly a Point of Prudence not to live <HI>quite up</HI> to <HI>that;</HI> but to lay up a Fund, to which he may have recour&s;e in any of tho&s;e adver&s;e Occurrences to which the mo&s;t exalted Stations are liable, as al&s;o to provide for younger Children which he has, or may have. He &s;hould not con|fide too much in Stewards or Agents, but in&s;pect his Property &s;o much at lea&s;t, as to be able to judge of their Conduct&mdash;He &s;hould not be indolently content with the formal Delivery of Accounts, but examine them, know why and wherefore he pays, and for what he is paid.</P>
<P>How fatal the contrary to all this has been to many Gentlemen of Fortune, and their Families, is &s;o unhappily atte&s;ted by many tragical Examples, as &s;hould, I think, be prevailing Arguments to en|force what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>IF our Fortunes are thrown out in any Schemes of Ba&s;ine&s;s for Improvement, our Expences and Manner of Living &s;hould be proportionable to our Fund and Pro&s;pects of Succe&s;s: And as the latter mo&s;t commonly depend on Attention and Prudence, we &s;hould con&s;tantly govern our &s;elves by them to the be&s;t of our Abilities. Avoid being engaged in any &s;uch precarious Schemes as by being abortive may utterly ruin us. As the Merchants &s;ay, we &s;hould not venture all on one Bottom, &s;o as that the common Accidents of Winds and Weather may totally &s;ink our Fortune. All our Engagements &s;hould be preceded by Fore-thought and Di&s;cretion: And in very important Ones 'twou'd be but ju&s;t and prudent to inform and con&s;ult a Wi&s;e, who&s;e intimate Concern therein does, I think demand it;

<P>Their Appearance and Expences, &s;hould neither degenerate into <HI>Sordidne&s;s,</HI> nor run into a <HI>wild Ex|travagance.</HI></P>

<P>SHE &s;hould ob&s;erve in the fir&s;t Place a <HI>prudent Frugality</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>BY our former Doctrine a Wife will have a general Notion of her Hu&s;band's Circum&s;tances; &s;he &s;hould therefore in tho&s;e Affairs which fall un|der her In&s;pection and Management, be &s;o govern|ed by the &s;aid Circum&s;tances, as to regulate her Hou&s;hold Expences by that ju&s;t Proportion which his Fortune will afford.</P>
<P>AND as on the one Hand <HI>Di&s;cretion</HI> mu&s;t pre|vent her from running into any <HI>lavi&s;h Extrava|gances,</HI> &s;o on the other &s;hould a <HI>generous Temper</HI> make her <HI>&s;corn</HI> any Thing that is <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>pitiful.</HI> 'Tis the happy and judicious <HI>Medium</HI> between the&s;e <HI>two Extremes,</HI> that con&s;titutes a <HI>prudent Fru|gality,</HI> and the true Excellency of Hou&s;ewifery.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="005772_0054_10270C05BA18F0A8">
'Tis one of the mo&s;t amiable Lights a Wife can &s;how her &s;elf in to publick Ob&s;ervation. It throws a Glory round her, which is not le&s;s to be reverenced than admired; does Honour to her Hu&s;band, and renders the Entertainment of her Gue&s;ts elegant and plea&s;ing. For as an <HI>imprudent O&s;tentation</HI> gives Pain and Ridicule; &s;o any thing <HI>meanly penurious,</HI> rai&s;es Indignation and Contempt.</P>
<P>WOMEN often want Judgment to direct, and Souls to execute this &s;kilful and lovely Medium of <HI>prudent Frugality,</HI> and thereby are either profu&s;e or &s;candalou&s;ly narrow.</P>
<P>'TIS therefore a Le&s;&s;on highly nece&s;&s;ary for them to learn; that all <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Ambition</HI> of <HI>exceeding</HI> their Circum&s;tances in this Part of Hou&s;ewifery, is very <HI>ridiculous,</HI> and with all People of good Sen&s;e creates <HI>Pity</HI> for their <HI>filly Extravagance,</HI> and <HI>Con|tempt</HI> of their <HI>weak Under&s;tandings.</HI></P>
<P>AND, on the other Hand, that every thing which is <HI>niggardly</HI> and <HI>&s;tingy,</HI> or <HI>beneath</HI> what may <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> be afforded, is the Mark of a <HI>little, grovelling, dirty Soul,</HI> and expo&s;es us to the Je&s;ts and Laughter of all Ob&s;ervers&mdash;The next Thing is</P>
<P>NEATNESS AND CLEANLINESS.</P>
<P>How nece&s;&s;ary this is to the Comfort and En|joyment of Life, and how <HI>dete&s;table</HI> a <HI>&s;lutti&s;h, na&s;ty Management,</HI> mu&s;t be, are Things &s;o very obvious, that little need be &s;aid to enforce it. But I mu&s;t ju&s;t mention one or two Faults in the Execution of this Part of Hou&s;ewifery, which many Women are guilty of, and that I wou'd have avioded in our Scheme.</P>
<P>The one is the <HI>ill timing</HI> of <HI>Cleanline&s;s,</HI> and the carrying it to &s;uch <HI>Extreams,</HI> that a Man's Hou&s;e

Some Women have &s;uch amphibious Di&s;|po&s;itions, that one would think they cho&s;e to be half of their Lives in Water; there's &s;uch a Clatter of Pails and Bru&s;hes, &s;uch Inundations in every Room, that a Man can't find a dry Place for the Sole of his Foot; &s;o that what &s;hould tend to make a Man's Hou&s;e an agreeable and whole&s;ome Dwel|ling, becomes &s;o <HI>dangerous</HI> and <HI>unplea&s;ant,</HI> that the <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> drives him out of it. And the&s;e Overflowings of Neatne&s;s are often &s;o <HI>ill timed,</HI> that a Man's Bu&s;ine&s;s is interrupted, and his Meals made uncomfortable by 'em. The&s;e <HI>Fi&s;h-wives</HI> have generally a great Fund of ill Nature, or a &s;mall one of good Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Fault is that <HI>Bigotry</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> for Neatne&s;s, which makes a Woman fretful and un|ea&s;y at every accidental or unavoidable Speck of Dirt, or the lea&s;t Di&s;ordering of her Furniture: You mu&s;t rub your Shoes till the Bottoms of your Feet are almo&s;t &s;ore, before you are permitted to enter a Room. Then &s;o many non&s;en&s;ical Exhor|tations and impertinent Que&s;tions are propos'd, that one might enter a Garri&s;on Town in War-time with-le&s;s ado. Such as, <HI>Pray don't meddle with that,</HI> and <HI>Pray don't put this out of its Place,</HI> that one would think there was a Spell on all the Fur|niture, or a Man was going to run away with Part of it.</P>
<P>THESE are all <HI>idle</HI> and <HI>childi&s;h Extreams:</HI> A prudent Hou&s;ewife &s;hould &s;o <HI>time</HI> her Neatne&s;s and Cleanline&s;s, that it may be as little inconvenient and trouble&s;ome to a Man as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;upport it with a graceful Ea&s;e, and a good-natured Sort
<PB N="49" REF="005772_0056_10270C0C15148BA0">of Indifference: The contrary has more of the <HI>Servant-Maid</HI> than the <HI>well bred Woman</HI> in it, and generally accompanies a <HI>low</HI> and <HI>mean Education.</HI></P>
<P>THE third Thing in the Character of a good Hou&s;ewifes, is A HARMONIOUS OECONOMY.</P>
<P>By which is meant, the maintaining <HI>Order, Peace</HI> and <HI>Tranquility,</HI> in her Hou&s;e; avoiding all noi&s;y and turbulent Scolding, for which many pretended Hou&s;ewifes are greatly blameable, make their Hu&s;|bands, their own, and their Servant's Lives, unea&s;y.</P>
<P>MANY Ladies are apt to mi&s;take this <HI>bu&s;tling</HI> and <HI>vociferous</HI> Turn for <HI>good Management;</HI> 'tis a great Mi&s;take, and rather &s;hows a <HI>Want Skill</HI> and <HI>Temper.</HI></P>
<P>WHERE the Mi&s;tre&s;s of a Family under&s;tands her Bu&s;ine&s;s, carries her Authority with <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> and at the &s;ame time with <HI>good Nature</HI> and <HI>Huma|nity,</HI> Servants will naturally be obedient and di|ligent.</P>
<P>BUT where Ignorance is joined with a tyrannick and in&s;olent Temper, there are generally Blunders and Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in Servants, Hatred of their Mi|&s;tre&s;s, a con&s;tant <HI>Din</HI> and <HI>Contention</HI> between them. A Man had better live in a Paper-Mill, or a Fi&s;h|woman's Stall, than in &s;uch a Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE Scenes are mighty unplea&s;ant, very &s;hocking, and highly prejudicial to the Tranquility of a married Life; are &s;ure Signs of a brutal Temper, and a very vulgar Education.</P>
<P>WHEREAS a Woman of Judgment, an <HI>even Mind,</HI> and a polite Ta&s;te, will be <HI>obeyed</HI> and <HI>beloved</HI> by her Servants: All Things will go on <HI>&s;mooth</HI> and <HI>quiet:</HI> Her Government will be <HI>mild, calm</HI> and
<PB N="50" REF="005772_0057_10270C10B88C0F18"><HI>harmonious:</HI> Her Hou&s;e the Habitation of <HI>Peace, Joy</HI> and <HI>Contentment!</HI></P>
<P>'TIS a Truth, I believe, with very few Excep|tions, that <HI>a good Mi&s;tre&s;s makes good Servants.</HI></P>
<P>PEOPLE of that Cla&s;s are not without Gratitude, and a Sen&s;e of Merit.</P>
<P>WHERE Women are ever complaining of <HI>their Servants,</HI> it carries a &s;trong Su&s;picion of <HI>their own</HI> Capacities and Temper.</P>
<P>WHEN a Mi&s;tre&s;s of a Hou&s;e is giving Orders to Servants, or talking to them, 'tis often done in &s;uch an <HI>imperious, bawling</HI> Manner, that &s;he is heard from every Corner. This is very unpolite, and &s;hows a <HI>little Mind,</HI> &s;o <HI>&s;welled</HI> with Power, that 'tis unable to &s;upport it with Decency and Temper.</P>
<P>THESE Cattle are &s;uch dome&s;tick Evils, that one had better live in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Dram-Cellar, than with their horrid Clangor.</P>
<P>ON the whole, a Mi&s;tre&s;s of a Family &s;hould car|ry on her Admini&s;tration in a <HI>mild</HI> and <HI>pacifick Man|ner,</HI> and if &s;he has any Di&s;putes with her Servants, conceal them from the Ears of a Hu&s;band and Com|pany, as much as po&s;&s;ible: Have every Thing done quietly, and in order.</P>
<P>IF Servants won't be thus governed, <HI>di&s;card</HI> them <HI>at once,</HI> and not &s;uffer her own and her Hu&s;band's Peace to be de&s;troyed by their Incorrigiblene&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS will make Home comfortable and agreea|ble; whereas the Want of this <HI>harmonious Oeconomy</HI> &s;ours the Temper of a Woman, drives a Man out of his own Hou&s;e, makes Home his Aver&s;ion, and de&s;troys that Serenity which is &s;o very e&s;&s;ential to the Felicity of all Society.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="005772_0058_10270C14F11FAB18">
AND now let us &s;top and &s;urvey a Wife thus <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> and <HI>di&s;creetly</HI> filling her Sphere of Action.</P>
<P>WHAT <HI>Veneration!</HI> What <HI>Prai&s;e!</HI> What <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>E&s;teem,</HI> can &s;ufficiently equal her <HI>Merit!</HI></P>
<P>THE Character of a Wife, can &s;carcely &s;hine in a more exalted Point of Light, nor do a more publick Honour to her&s;elf and her Hu&s;band. Whoever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch a One, <HI>Joy</HI> will <HI>&s;parkle</HI> in his Eye, and <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> fill his Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>CAN the <HI>fla&s;hy</HI> and <HI>&s;uperficial Glare</HI> of Dre&s;s and Equipage, give a Title to &s;uch <HI>&s;olid Excellence</HI> and <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial Worth?</HI> Po&s;itively NOT. The twinkling Lu&s;tre of a Chry&s;tal, may as well equal the augu&s;t Splendor of a royal Diamond.</P>
<P>ON the whole, each Party thus &s;upporting their re&s;pective Admini&s;tration with Prudence and Di&s;|cretion, will fix a Crown of Triumph on their Uni|on, be a la&s;ting Cement to their Tranquility and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>AND now my Friend, your Ta&s;k of Patience is drawing to a Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>CONFORMABLE to your Reque&s;t, I have thrown before you my private Sentiments on the Subject of that Afternoon's Debate, which, you &s;ay, threw you into a Sort of Sceptici&s;m.&mdash;Whether my rough Thoughts may in any wi&s;e tend to determine your Opinion, I know not. If they give you any A|mu&s;ement, to atone for the Trouble of Reading them, I &s;hall be well plea&s;ed.&mdash;But if neither one nor the other, you mu&s;t blame your Influence over me for their Impertinence.</P>
<P>FOR my own Part, I confe&s;s, to think it <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> for a Man of <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> of <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> to find
<PB N="52" REF="005772_0059_10270C169C6E9468">Woman, in who&s;e Society he may lay as probable a Foundation for the Enjoyment and Happine&s;s of his Life by Marriage, and to &s;uper&s;truct as rea&s;ona|ble a Pro&s;pect of continuing his Felicity in that Uni|on, as any other Scheme of Life can lay claim to.</P>
<P>'TIS a Truth as univer&s;ally experienced as owned, that no State of Life is exempt from the Alternatives of Plea&s;ure and Pain, the bitter and &s;weet; and that a Perfection of Happine&s;s is not the Lot of Humani|ty.</P>
<P>IF this be the Ca&s;e with human Life in general, and its proper Character, MARRIAGE is not le&s;s worth your Choice, becau&s;e it may have, or has, In|conveniencies and Alloys.&mdash;</P>
<P>IF tho&s;e Inconveniencies and Alloys are nece&s;&s;arily greater, (without a proportionable Superiority of Plea&s;ures) in a conjugal than a &s;ingle Life, the lat|ter is undoubtedly to be preferred.&mdash;But I believe <HI>they</HI> cannot be proved <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> &s;o, only <HI>circum|&s;tantially.</HI>&mdash;Well, the Que&s;tion then is, Whether the&s;e <HI>circum&s;tantial</HI> Impediments, which are, or may be, alledged again&s;t the Choice of a married Life, cannot, by a <HI>proper Conduct, in</HI> the <HI>Time</HI> of Court|&s;hip, and <HI>after,</HI> be removed.</P>
<P>'TIS thought they may; and the De&s;ign of the&s;e Papers is to propo&s;e <HI>how,</HI> and <HI>by what Methods.</HI></P>
<P>AND we conceive, the Ob&s;ervations made, and the Methods propo&s;ed, may be effectual, and are not impracticable, to put the married State not only on an Equality of probable Happine&s;s with a &s;ingle One, but to give it a Pro&s;pect of &s;uperior Felicity.</P>
<P>HOWEVER <HI>un&s;kilfully</HI> this Argument may have been handled by me, and of how little Advantage
<PB N="53" REF="005772_0060_10270C1DF950E9A0">&s;oever my <HI>weak Attempts</HI> may have been to &s;erve it; the Truth of the Propo&s;tions remain <HI>in Force.</HI></P>
<P>FIRST. <HI>That unhappy Matches are often occa&s;ion'd by meer mercenary Views, in one or both of the Par|ties: Or by the head-&s;trong Motives of ill-conduc|ted Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, <HI>That by a prudent and judicious Pro|ceeding in our Addre&s;&s;es to a young Lady of a good natural Temper, we may lay a very good Foundation for making her an agreeable Companion, a &s;teady Friend, and a good Wife.</HI></P>
<P>AND Thirdly, <HI>That after Marriage, by conti|nuing in the Road of Prudence and Judgment, we may make the nuptial State as happy as we can promi&s;e our &s;elves from any other.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, Sir, whenever I am inclined for a <HI>matrimonial Voyage,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour thus to <HI>&s;teer my Cour&s;e,</HI> and if I cannot <HI>gain the Port</HI> by this Manner of Court&s;hip and Conduct, I will re&s;t con|tented with my pre&s;ent Condition.</P>
<P>IF, on the other Hand, I &s;hould <HI>thereby</HI> gain the Inclinations and Con&s;ent of a Lady, I &s;hall endea|vour to &s;upport my Happine&s;s in &s;ome &s;uch Manner as I have herein intimated.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO A Very Young LADY ON HER <HI>MARRIAGE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Hurry and Impertinence of receiving and Paying Vi&s;its on Account of your Marriage, being now over, you are be|ginning to enter into a Cour&s;e of Life, where you will want much Advice to divert you from falling into many Errors, Fopperies, and Fol|lies, to which your Sex is &s;ubject. I have always borne an entire Friend&s;hip to your Father and Mo|ther; and the Per&s;on they have cho&s;en for your Hu&s;band, hath been, for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, my par|ticular Favourite; I have long wi&s;h'd you might come together, becau&s;e I hoped, that from the
<PB N="56" REF="005772_0062_10270C25E5C56B18">Goodne&s;s of your Di&s;po&s;ition, and by following the Coun&s;el of wife Friends, you might, in Time, make your &s;elf worthy of him. Your Parents were &s;o far in the Right that they did not produce you much into the World, whereby you avoided many wrong Steps which others have taken, and have fewer ill Impre&s;&s;ions to be removed: But they fail'd, as it is generally the Ca&s;e, in too much neglecting to cul|tivate your Mind; without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to acquire or pre&s;erve the Friend&s;hip and E&s;teem of a wife Man, who &s;oon grows weary of acting the Lover, and treating his Wife like a Mi&s;tre&s;s, but wants a rea&s;onable Companion, and a true Friend, through every Stage of his Life. It mu&s;t be there|fore your Bu&s;ine&s;s to qualify your&s;elf for tho&s;e Offi|ces; wherein I will not fail to be your Director, as long as I &s;hall think you de&s;erve, it, by letting you know how you are to act, and what you are to avoid.</P>
<P>AND beware of de&s;pi&s;ing or neglecting my In&s;tructions, whereon will depend not only your making a good Figure in the World, but your own real Happine&s;s, as well as that of the Per|&s;on who ought to be the deare&s;t to you.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore de&s;ire you, in the fir&s;t Place, to be very &s;low in changing the <HI>mode&s;t Behaviour</HI> of a <HI>Virgin:</HI> It is u&s;ual in young Wives, before they have been many Weeks marry'd, to a&s;&s;ume a bold forward Look and Manner of talking, as if they intended to &s;ignify in all Companies, that they were no longer Girls, and con&s;equently that their whole Demeanor, before they got a Hu&s;band, was all but a Countenance and Con&s;traint upon their Na|ture; whereas, I &s;uppo&s;e, if the Votes of wi&s;e Men were gather'd, a very great Majority would
<PB N="57" REF="005772_0063_10270C278128D830">be in Favour of tho&s;e Ladies, who, after they were enter'd into that State, rather cho&s;e to double their Portion of Mode&s;ty and Re&s;ervedne&s;s.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t likewi&s;e warn you &s;trictly again&s;t the lea&s;t Degree of <HI>Fondne&s;s</HI> to your Hu&s;band before any Witne&s;s what&s;oever, even before your neare&s;t Rela|tions, or the very Maids of your Chamber. This Proceeding is &s;o exceeding odious and di&s;gu&s;tful to all who have either good Breeding or good Sen&s;e, that they a&s;&s;ign two very unamiable Rea&s;ons for it; the one is gro&s;s Hypocrify, and the other has too bad a Name to mention. If there is any Dif|ference to be made, your Hu&s;band is the lowe&s;t Per&s;on in Company, either at Home or Abroad, and every Gentleman pre&s;ent has a better Claim to all Marks of Civility and Di&s;tinction from you. Conceal your E&s;teem and Love in your own Brea&s;t, and re&s;erve your kind Looks and Language for pri|vate Hours, which are &s;o many in the Four and Twenty, that they will afford time to employ a Pa&s;&s;ion as exalted as any that was ever de&s;crib'd in a <HI>French</HI> Romance.</P>
<P>UPON this Head, I &s;hould likewi&s;e advi&s;e you to differ in Practice from tho&s;e Ladies who affect Abundance of <HI>Unea&s;ine&s;s</HI> while their Hu&s;bands are abroad; &s;tart with every Knock at the Door, and ring the Bell ince&s;&s;antly for the Servants to let in their Ma&s;ter; will not eat a Bit at Dinner or Sup|per if the Hu&s;band happens to &s;tay out; and re|ceive him at his Return with &s;uch a Medley of Chiding and Kindne&s;s, and catechi&s;ing him where he has been, that a Shrew from <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> would be a more ea&s;y and eligible Companion.</P>
<P>OF the &s;ame Leaven are tho&s;e Wives, who when
<PB N="58" REF="005772_0064_10270C2A55055900">their Hu&s;bands are gone a Journey, mu&s;t have a Letter every Po&s;t, upon pain of Fits and Hi&s;tericks; and a Day mu&s;t be fix'd for their Return Home, without the lea&s;t Allowance for Bu&s;ine&s;s, or Sick|ne&s;s, or Accidents, or Weather: Upon which, I can only &s;ay, that in my Ob&s;ervation, tho&s;e Ladies who are apt to make the greate&s;t Clutter on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, would liberally have paid a Me&s;&s;enger for bringing them News, that their Hu&s;bands had broken their Necks on the Road.</P>
<P>You will perhaps be offended, when I advi&s;e you to abate a little of that violent Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>fine Cloaths,</HI> &s;o predominant in your Sex. It is a little hard, that ours, for who&s;e Sake you wear them, are not admitted to be of your Council. I may venture to a&s;&s;ure you, that we will make an Abatement at any Time of four Pounds a Yard in a Brocade, if the Ladies will but allow a &s;uitable Addition of Care in the <HI>Cleanline&s;s</HI> and Sweetne&s;s of their Per|&s;ons. For the &s;atyrical Part of Mankind will needs believe, that it is not impo&s;&s;ible to be very fine and very filthy; and that the Capacities of a Lady are &s;ometimes apt to fall &s;hort in cultivating Clean|line&s;s and Finery together. I &s;hall only add, upon &s;o tender a Subject, what a plea&s;ant Gentleman &s;aid concerning a &s;illy Woman of Quality; that nothing could make her &s;upportable but cutting off her Head, for his Ears were offended by her Tongue, and his No&s;e by her Hair and Teeth.</P>
<P>I am wholly at a lo&s;s how to advi&s;e you in the Choice of <HI>Company,</HI> which, however, is a Point of as great Importance as any in your Life. If your general Acquaintance be among Ladies who are your Equals or Superiors, provided they have nothing of
<PB N="59" REF="005772_0065_10270C30D5AC85E0">what is commonly called an ill Reputation, you think you are &s;afe; and this, in the Stile of the World, will pa&s;s for good Company. Whereas I am afraid it will be hard for you to pick out one Female Ac|quaintance in this Town, from whom you will not be in manife&s;t Danger of contracting &s;ome Foppery, Affectation, Vanity, Folly, or Vice. Your only &s;afe Way of conver&s;ing with them is, by a firm Re&s;olution to proceed in your Practice and Behaviour directly contrary to whatever they &s;hall &s;ay or do: And this I take to be a good general Rule, with very few Exceptions. For In&s;tance, In the Doctrines they u&s;ually deliver to young mar|ry'd Women for managing their Hu&s;bands; their &s;everal Accounts of their own Conduct in that Par|ticular, to recommend it to your Imitation; the Reflections they make upon others of their Sex for acting differently; their Directions how to come off with Victory upon any Di&s;pute or Quarrel you may have with your Hu&s;band; the Arts by which you may di&s;cover and practi&s;e upon his weak Side; when to work by Flattery and In&s;inuation, when to melt him with Tears, and when to engage with a high Hand. In the&s;e, and a Thou&s;and o|ther Ca&s;es, it will be prudent to retain as many of their Lectures in your Memory as you can, and then determine to act in full Oppo&s;ition to them all.</P>
<P>I hope your Hu&s;band will interpo&s;e his Au|thority to limit you in the Trade of <HI>Vi&s;iting;</HI> half a dozen Fools are in all Con&s;cience as many as you &s;hould require; and it will be &s;ufficient for you to &s;ee them twice a Year: For I think the Fa&s;hion does not exact, that Vi&s;its &s;hould be paid to Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="005772_0066_10270C326C8AB9A8">
I advi&s;e that your Company at Home &s;hould con|&s;i&s;t of Men, rather than Women. To &s;ay the Truth I never yet knew a tolerable Woman to be fond of her own Sex. I confe&s;s, when both are mix'd and well cho&s;en, and put their be&s;t Quali|ties forward, there may be an Intercour&s;e of Ci|vility and Good-will, which, with the Addition of &s;ome Degree of Sen&s;e, can make Conver&s;ation or any Amu&s;ement agreeable. But a Knot of Ladies got together by them&s;elves, is a very School of Im|pertinence and Detraction, and it is well if tho&s;e be the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>LET your Men-acquaintance be of your Hu&s;|band's Choice, and not recommended to you by any She-companions; becau&s;e they will certaintly fix a Coxcomb upon you, and it will co&s;t you &s;ome Time and Pains before you can arrive at the Knowledge of di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;uch a one from a Man of Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>NEVER take a <HI>favourite Waiting-Maid</HI> into your Cabinet-Council, to entertain you with Hi|&s;tories of tho&s;e Ladies whom &s;he hath formerly &s;erv'd, of their Diver&s;ions and their Dre&s;&s;es; to in&s;inuate how great a Fortune you brought, and how little you are allow'd to &s;quander; to appeal to her from your Hu&s;band, and to be determined by her Judg|ment, becau&s;e you are &s;ure it will be always for you; to receive and di&s;card Servants by her Ap|probation or Di&s;like; to engage you, by her In&s;inu|ations, into Mi&s;under&s;tandings with your be&s;t Friends; to repre&s;ent all Things in fal&s;e Colours, and to be the common Emi&s;&s;ary of Scandal.</P>
<P>BUT the grand Affair of your Life will be to gain and pre&s;erve the Friend&s;hip and E&s;teem of
<PB N="61" REF="005772_0067_10270C3559A932D8">your <HI>Hu&s;band.</HI> Your are married to a Man of good Education and Learning, of an excellent Under|&s;tanding, and an exact Ta&s;te. It is true, and it is happy for you, that the&s;e Qualities in him are adorn'd with great Mode&s;ty, a mo&s;t amiable Sweet|ne&s;s of Temper, and an unu&s;ual Di&s;po&s;ition to So|briety and Virtue; But neither Good-nature nor Virtue will &s;uffer him to e&s;teem you again&s;t his Judgment; and although he is not capable of u&s;ing you ill, yet you will in Time grow a Thing indiffe|rent and perhaps contemptible; unle&s;s you can &s;up|ply the Lo&s;s of Youth and Beauty with more du|rable Qualities. Your have very few Years to be young and hand&s;ome in the Eyes of the World; and as few Months to be &s;o in the Eyes of a Hu&s;|band, who is not a fool; for I hope you do not &s;til dream of Charms and Raptures, which Mar|riage ever did, and ever will, put a &s;adden End to Be&s;ides, your's was a Match of Prudence and com|mon Good-liking, without any Mixture of that ridiculous Pa&s;&s;ion, which has no Being but in Play-Books and Romances.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t therefore u&s;e all Endeavours to attain to &s;ome Degree of tho&s;e Accompli&s;hments which your Hu&s;band mo&s;t values in other People, and for which he is mo&s;t valued him&s;elf. You mu&s;t improve your Mind, by clo&s;ely pur&s;uing &s;uch a Method of Study as I &s;hall direct or approve of You mu&s;t get a Collection of Hi&s;tory and Travels, which I will recommend to you, and &s;pend &s;ome Hours every Day in reading them, and making Extracts from them, if your Memory be weak. You mu&s;t invite Per&s;ons of Knowledge and Under|&s;tanding to an Acquaintance with, you, by who&s;e
<PB N="62" REF="005772_0068_10270C380BE8D400">Conver&s;ation you may learn to correct your Ta&s;te and Judgment; and when you can bring your&s;elf to comprehend and reli&s;h the good Sen&s;e of others, you will arrive in time to think rightly your &s;elf, and to become a rea&s;onable and agreeable Com|panion. This mu&s;t produce in your Hu&s;band a true rational Love and E&s;teem for you, which old Age will not dimini&s;h. He will have regard for your Judgment and Opinion in Matters of the greate&s;t Weight; you will be able to entertain each other without a third Per&s;on to relieve you by find|ing Di&s;cour&s;e. The Endowments of your Mind will even make your Per&s;on more agreeable to him; and when you are alone, your Time will not lie heavy upon your Hands for want of &s;ome trifling Amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>As little Re&s;pect as I have for the Generality of your Sex, it hath &s;ometimes moved me with Pity, to &s;ee the Lady of the Hou&s;e forced to withdraw immediately after Dinner, and this in Families where there is not much Drinking; as if it were an e&s;tabli&s;hed Maxim, that Women are uncapable of all Conver&s;ation. In a Room where both Sexes meet, if the Men are di&s;cour&s;ing upon any general Subject, the Ladies never think it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to partake in what pa&s;&s;es, but in a &s;eparate Club enter|tain each other with the Price and Choice of Lace, and Silk, and what Dre&s;&s;es they liked or di&s;ap|prov'd at the Church or the Play-hou&s;e. And when you are among your&s;elves, how naturally, after the fir&s;t Complements, do you apply your Hands to each others Lappets and Rufles, and Man|tua's, as if the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of your Lives, and the publick Concern of the World, depended upon
<PB N="63" REF="005772_0069_10270C3AAF13AE78">the Cut or Colour of your Dre&s;&s;es. As Divines &s;ay, that &s;ome People take more Pains to be dam|ned, than it would co&s;t them to be &s;aved; &s;o your Sex employs more Thought, Memory and Appli|cation, to be Fools, than would &s;erve to make them wi&s;e and u&s;eful. When I reflect on this, I cannot conceive you to be human Creatures, but a Sort of Species hardly a Degree above a Monkey; who has more diverting Tricks than any of you, is an Animal le&s;s mi&s;chievous and expen&s;ive, might in time be a tolerable Critick in Velvet and Brocade, and, for ought I know, would equally become them.</P>
<P>I would have you look upon Finery as a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Folly, as all great Ladies did, whom I have ever known: I do not de&s;ire you to be out of the Fa&s;hion, but to be the la&s;t and lea&s;t in it. I expect that your Dre&s;s &s;hall be one Degree lower than your Fortune can afford; and in your own Heart I would wi&s;h you to be an utter Contemner of all Di&s;tinctions which a finer Petticoat can give you; becau&s;e it will neither make you richer, hand&s;omer, younger, better natur'd, more virtuous, or wi&s;e, than if it hung upon a Peg.</P>
<P>IF you are in Company with Men of Learning, tho' they happen to di&s;cour&s;e of Arts and Sciences out of your Compa&s;s, yet you will gather more Advantage by li&s;t'ning to them, than from all the Non&s;en&s;e and Frippery of your own Sex; but if they be Men of Breeding as well as Learning, they will &s;eldom engage in any Conver&s;ation where you ought not to be a Hearer, and in time have your Part. If they talk of the Manners and Cu&s;toms of the &s;everal Kingdoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> of Travels into re|moter
<PB N="64" REF="005772_0070_10270C3D6B4EDA60">Nations, of the State of their own Country, or of the great Men and Actions of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome;</HI> if they give their Judgment upon <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Writers, either in Ver&s;e or Pro&s;e, or of the Nature and Limits of Virtue and Vice, it is a Shame for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lady not to reli&s;h &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es, not to improve by them, and endeavour, by Reading and Information, to have her Share in tho&s;e Entertainments, rather than turn a&s;ide, as it is the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, and con&s;ult with the Woman who &s;its next her, about a new Cargo of Fans.</P>
<P>IT is a little hard, that not one Gentleman's Daughter in a Thou&s;and &s;hould be brought to read or under&s;tand her own natural Tongue, or be Judge of the ea&s;ie&s;t Books that are written in it; as any One may find, who can have the Patience to hear them, when they are dispos'd to man|gle a Play or a Novel, where the lea&s;t Word out of the common Road if &s;ure to di&s;concert them. It is no Wonder, when they are not &s;o much as taught to &s;pell in their Childhood, nor can ever attain to it in their whole Lives. I advi&s;e you therefore to read aloud, more or le&s;s, every Day to your Hu&s;band it he will permit you, or to any other Friend, (but not a Female One) who is able to &s;et you right; and as for Spelling, you may compa&s;s it in time, by making Collections from the Books you read.</P>
<P>I know very well that tho&s;e who are commonly called learned Women, have lo&s;t all Manner of Credit by their impertment Talkativene&s;s and Con|ceit of them&s;elves; but there is an ea&s;y Remedy for this, if you once con&s;ider, that after all the the Pains you may be at, you never can arrive, in
<PB N="65" REF="005772_0071_10270C43D5FC95F8">Point of Learning, to the Perfection of a School|boy. The Reading I would advi&s;e you to, is only for Improvement of your own good Sen&s;e, which will never fail of being mended by Di&s;cretion. It is a wrong. Method, and ill Choice of Books, that makes tho&s;e learned Ladies ju&s;t &s;o much wor&s;e for what they have read. And therefore it &s;hall be my Care to direct you better, a Ta&s;k for which I take my &s;elf to be not ill qualify'd; becau&s;e I have &s;pent more time, and have had more Opportunities than many others, to ob&s;erve and di&s;cover from what Sources the various Follies of Women are deriv'd.</P>
<P>PRAY ob&s;erve how in&s;ignificant Things are the common Race of Ladies, when they have pa&s;&s;ed their Youth and Beauty; how contemptible they appear to the Men, and yet more contemptible to the younger Part of their own Sex; and have no Re|lief bat in pa&s;&s;ing their Afternoons in Vi&s;its, where they are never acceptable; and their Evenings at Cards among each other; while the former Part of the Day is &s;pent in Spleen and Envy, or in vain Endeavours to repair by Art and Dre&s;s the Ruins of Time. Whereas I have known Ladies at Sixty, to whom all the polite Part of the Court and Town paid their Addre&s;&s;es, without any farther View than that of enjoying the Plea&s;ure of their Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I am ignorant of any one Quality that is amiable in a Man, which is not equally &s;o in a Woman: I do not except even Mode&s;ty and Gentlene&s;s of Na|ture. Nor do I know one Vice or Folly which is not equally dete&s;table in both. There is indeed one Infirmity which &s;eems to be generally allow'd you, I mean that of <HI>Cowardice:</HI> Yet there &s;hould
<PB N="66" REF="005772_0072_1026E07DF0B02450">&s;eem to be &s;omething very capricious, that when Women profe&s;s their Admiration for a Colonel or a Captain on Account of his Valour, they &s;hould fancy it a very graceful becoming Quality in them|&s;elves to be afraid of their own Shadows; to &s;cream in a Barge when the Weather is calme&s;t, or in a Coach at the Ring; to run from a Cow at a hun|dred Yards Di&s;tance; to fall into Fits at the Sight of a Spider, and Earwig, or a Frog. At lea&s;t, if Cowardice be a Sign of Cruclty, (as it is generally granted) I can hardly think it an Accompli&s;hment &s;o de&s;irable as to be thought worth improving by Affectation.</P>
<P>AND as the &s;ame Virtues equally become both Sexes, &s;o there is no quality whereby Women en|deavour to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from Men, for which they are not ju&s;t &s;o much the wor&s;e, except that only of Re&s;ervedne&s;s; which however, as you generally manage it, it nothing el&s;e but Affectation or Hypocri&s;y. For as you cannot too much di&s;|countenance tho&s;e of your Sex, who pre&s;ume to take unbecoming Liberty before you; &s;o you ought to be wholly uncon&s;train'd in the Company of de|&s;erving Men, when you have had &s;ufficient Expe|rience of their Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>THERE is never wanting in this Town, a Tribe of bold, &s;waggering, rattling Ladies, who&s;e Talents pa&s;s among Coxcombs for Wit and Humour; their Excellency lies in rude choquing Expre&s;&s;ions, and what they call <HI>Running a Man down.</HI> If a Gen|tleman in their Company happens to have any Ble|mi&s;h in his Birth or Per&s;on, if any Misfortune hath befallen his Family or him&s;elf, for which he is a|&s;ham'd, they will be &s;ure to give him broad Hints
<PB N="67" REF="005772_0073_10270C4BC13D71A0">of it without any Provocation. I would recom|mend you to the Acquaintance of a common Pro|&s;titute, rather than to that of &s;uch Termagants as the&s;e. I have often thought that no Man is oblig'd to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch Creatures to be Women; but to treat them like in&s;olent Ra&s;cals di&s;guis'd in female Habits, who ought to be &s;tript and kick'd down Stairs.</P>
<P>I will add one Thing, altho' it be a little out of Place which is to de&s;ire, that you will learn to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and e&s;teem your Hu&s;band for tho&s;e good Qualities which he really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth, and not to &s;ancy others in him which he certainly hath not. For altho' this Letter is generally under&s;tood to be a Mark of Love, yet it is indeed nothing but Af|fectation or ill Judgment. It is true, he wants &s;o very few Accompli&s;hments, that you are in no great Danger of erring on this Side; but my cau|tion is occa&s;ion'd by a Lady of your Acquaintance, marry'd to a very valuable Per&s;on, whom yet the is &s;o unfortunate as to be always commending for tho&s;e Perfections to which he can lea&s;t pretend.</P>
<P>I can give you no Advice upon the Article of <HI>Expence,</HI> only I think you ought to be well in|form'd how much your Hu&s;band's Revenue a|mounts to, and be &s;o good a Computer as to keep within it, in that Part of the Management which falls to your Share; and not to put your &s;elf in the Number of tho&s;e politick Ladies who think they gain a great Point, when they have teaz'd their Hu&s;bands to buy them a new Equi|page, a lac'd Head, or a fine Petticoat, without once con&s;idering what long Scores remain unpaid to the Butche.</P>

I de&s;ire you will keep this Letter in your Cabi|net, and often examine impartially your whole Conduct by it: And &s;o God ble&s;s you, and make you a fair Example to your Sex, and a perpetual Comfort to your Hu&s;band and your Parents. I am, with great Truth and Affection,</P>
