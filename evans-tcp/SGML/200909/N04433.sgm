<Q><BIBL><HI>JOB I. 21.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; Ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the LORD.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is the latter Part of the fir&s;t Speech of <HI>Job,</HI> on the &s;urprizing Lo&s;s, not only of his E&s;tate; but al&s;o and more e&s;pecially his <HI>Children,</HI> who no doubt were va&s;tly the mo&s;t dear to Him, and their awful and &s;udden Death by far the mo&s;t afflicting.</P>
<P>See how bitterly He bewails their Lo&s;s in Chapter xxix. 2&mdash;5. <HI>Oh that I were as in Months pa&s;t, as</HI> in <HI>the Days</HI> when GOD <HI>pre&s;erved me! when his Candle &s;hined upon my Head,</HI> and when <HI>by his Light I walked</HI> through <HI>Darkne&s;s! as I was in the Days of my Youth, when the Secret of GOD was upon my Tabernacle! when the</HI> AL|MIGHTY was <HI>yet with me! when</HI> MY CHILDREN were <HI>about me.</HI></P>
<P>While <HI>one</HI> in ha&s;te was telling Him, the <HI>Sabaeans</HI> had <HI>taken away his Oxen and A&s;&s;es and &s;lain his Servants</HI> work|ing with them; <HI>another</HI> comes and tells Him, <HI>the Fire of GOD</HI> had <HI>fallen from Heaven and burnt up both his Sheep and Servants</HI> with <HI>them:</HI> while this was &s;peaking, runs a <HI>third</HI> and tells Him, the <HI>Chaldaeans</HI> had <HI>carried away
<PB N="6" REF="005481_0004_10183A102E93D7E8">
his Camels and &s;lain his Servants</HI> attending <HI>them:</HI> and while this was &s;peaking, comes a <HI>Fourth</HI> with more &s;ur|prizing News than all&mdash; How <HI>a Great Wind had blown down the Hou&s;e</HI> where his CHILDREN were making merry, and <HI>killed them</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Me&s;&s;age, as a judicious Expo&s;itor ob&s;erves, was by the Policy of <HI>Satan</HI> re&s;erved to the la&s;t, (1) Be|cau&s;e the Tidings for the <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> of his <HI>Goods</HI> would not have been &s;o grievous, had He heard of his <HI>Children's Death</HI> before, to whom He hoped to have left them: And indeed when a Man lies under a <HI>Great</HI> Affliction, a <HI>Le&s;s</HI> is not much minded. (2) Becau&s;e when he was more and more &s;urpriz'd and pre&s;&s;ed with the former heavy and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Tidings, He would be the le&s;s able to bear <HI>this mo&s;t afflicting of all,</HI> the more likely to &s;ink down under it, and to brake forth into Impatience and evil Tho'ts and Speeches again&s;t the &s;overeign GOD. (<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot">A. Jack&s;on.</NOTE>)</P>
<P>But upon this immediately we read&mdash; <Q>Then <HI>Job</HI> a|ro&s;e, and rent his Mantle, and &s;haved his Head, and fell down upon the Ground, and wor&s;hipped, and &s;aid, Naked came I out of my Mother's Womb, and naked &s;hall I return Thither; <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>gave, and the</HI> LORD <HI>hath taken away; Ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the</HI> LORD.</Q></P>
<P>Here we have (1) His affectionate and religious <HI>Car|riage;</HI> and (2) His wi&s;e and pious <HI>Speech</HI> on this Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. His affectionate and religious <HI>Carriage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> JOB <HI>aro&s;e:</HI> as one that &s;unk not under his heavy Affliction; but that in a &s;uitable Manner He might be|have Him&s;elf, and &s;how his due Re&s;entment of this afflicting Providence.</P>
<P><HI>And rent his Mantle and &s;haved his Head:</HI> This He did as a lively Expre&s;&s;ion, both of his great Trouble, and of his penitent and contrite Frame of Spirit under &s;o grievous a Cha&s;ti&s;ement. As for the&s;e outward Rites
<PB N="7" REF="005481_0005_101839CF4CF2BE38">
ob&s;erved in tho&s;e ancient Times and Places; they were particular Cu&s;toms of a meer arbitrary Nature, which People of other Countries or Ages are by no Means obliged to u&s;e: But where tho&s;e Rites prevailed, they were very &s;ignificant and moving both to the afflicted them&s;elves and to tho&s;e who &s;aw them. So JACOB <HI>rent his Cloaths</HI> at the &s;uppo&s;ed Death of his beloved <HI>Jo&s;eph. Gen.</HI> xxxvii. 34: And the Intent might be to &s;ignify, how his Heart was rent with Grief, and what little Comfort He took in the Things about Him. So the <HI>&s;having of the Head</HI> was al&s;o u&s;ed in Times of great Affliction: as in <HI>Jer.</HI> vii. 29. <HI>Cut off thine Hair O</HI> JE|RUSALEM, <HI>and ca&s;t it away, and take up a Lamentation.</HI> And it &s;eems to be done to &s;ignify, that their Ca&s;e was &s;o deplorable, as it became them to lay by all their Or|naments; the Hair being then accounted a principal Part of their Ornament. (<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot">A. Jack&s;on.</NOTE>)</P>
<P><HI>And fell down upon the Ground, and wor&s;hipped.</HI> He either fell down on his <HI>Knees,</HI> or rather pro&s;trate on his <HI>Face;</HI> as <HI>Mercer</HI> &amp; all the other Ver&s;ions repre&s;ent Him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Mercer</HI> on <HI>Job,</HI> and the <HI>Polyglot Bible,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. But He <HI>fell down on the Ground,</HI> to &s;ignify his low Hu|miliation under the Stroke of GOD: and He fell down, to wor&s;hip in a more lowly Manner, or as a Token of the mo&s;t profound Adoration and Submi&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Syriack</HI> and <HI>Arabick</HI> render it; <HI>He fell down on the Earth adoring. And wor&s;hipped:</HI> i. e. with religious Reverence He &s;aw and humbly own'd, paid Homage and &s;ubmit|ted to that DIVINE, &s;overeign and awful POWER which had &s;o &s;orely &s;mitten Him.</P>
<P>And here, his humble Wor&s;hip is not meerly <HI>mental,</HI> or wholly &s;ilent; but with becoming outward <HI>Po&s;tures,</HI> it al&s;o b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">es forth in <HI>Expre&s;&s;ions</HI> full of lowly Sentiments about Him&s;elf, Acknowledgements of the holy Hand of GOD, and of Honour to Him under all the&s;e grievous Di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="005481_0006_10183A14CAC98150">2. We have then his wi&s;e and pious <HI>Speech,</HI> on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Short indeed, but extreamly pertinent and pithy&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>And &s;aid, 'Naked came I out of my Mother's Womb:</HI> with Self-aba&s;ement He looks <HI>back</HI> to the Time of his Birth; when He came naked into the World, without the <HI>E&s;tate</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> He had &s;ince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and is now without again. <HI>And naked &s;hall I return Thither:</HI> He now as humbly looks <HI>forward</HI> al&s;o to that certain Time approaching when He mu&s;t return as naked out of the World as when He came into it. By a beauti|ful Turn of Speech, He &s;eems now to look on the <HI>Earth</HI> to which he was fallen either as his <HI>Original</HI> or <HI>Future</HI> MOTHER, and the <HI>Grave</HI> as her <HI>Womb,</HI> to which e're long He &s;hould return as naked as He was Born. As if He had &s;aid&mdash;<Q>As I came naked from my <HI>Mother's</HI>Womb; I &s;hall return naked to <HI>This Earth</HI> to which I am fallen.</Q> Yea by Returning <HI>Thither,</HI> He may &s;eem to &s;ignify; that when He &s;hould go out of this vi&s;ible World, He &s;hould return to a State in the <HI>Grave</HI> like that in the <HI>Womb</HI> of his <HI>Humane Mother:</HI> (that as <HI>There</HI> He was once &s;hut up in Darkne&s;s, waiting for a happy Deliverance; &s;o when his Body came to be &s;hut up naked in the <HI>Grave</HI> or <HI>Womb</HI> of his <HI>Mother the Earth,</HI> it would be There as an <HI>Embrio</HI> al&s;o, waiting for an happier Exit into a World of Glory. (<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot">A. Jack&s;on.</NOTE>)</P>
<P>Nor are his Tho'ts confin'd to Him&s;elf, or the Earth, or his great Affliction: But He looks up to GOD as the Orderer of whatever befell Him, and under all He <HI>Ble&s;&s;es</HI> this &s;overeign Being. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>gave, and the</HI> LORD <HI>hath taken away; Ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>By the NAME of the LORD is meant THE LORD HIM|SELF: as the <HI>Name</HI> is often taken for <HI>Him</HI> who bears it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sanctius <HI>in</HI> Pol. Synop&s;i.</NOTE>. The Words in the Original are&mdash;JEHOVAH <HI>gave, and</HI> JEHOVAH <HI>hath taken away; Ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="005481_0007_101839D0E9340110">
JEHOVAH: and in every Clau&s;e he repeats this venera|ble Name JEHOVAH, to &s;ignify, how intently his Mind was fix'd upon HIM in the&s;e afflicting Di&s;pen&s;ations, and what a &s;ublime Plea&s;ure the Idea gave Him.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Things we &s;ee his &s;oaring <HI>Piety</HI> in the mid&s;t of his mo&s;t grievous Trials; and how by <HI>Faith</HI> it ri&s;es from the deep Re&s;entments of <HI>Nature</HI> in &s;inking Sor|rows, to the Heights of <HI>Grace</HI> and Employment of Heaven in <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing the Name of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t his natural Pa&s;&s;ions vent them&s;elves in rending his Mantle and &s;having his Head, in &s;poiling Him&s;elf of his Ornaments and falling down to the Ground: There He humbles Him&s;elf and wor&s;hips: He owns his naked State as He came into the World; that He had &s;ince received all his Enjoyments at the &s;overeign Hand of GOD; that GOD had be&s;towed them as tran|&s;ient Comforts; that when He comes to Die He mu&s;t part with them all; that GOD had a Right to take them away before, when He plea&s;ed; and that now they are gone, it is HE that has taken them: Yea He owns his Obligations of Gratitude to this DIVINE DISPOSER, in Giving Him his plea&s;ant Enjoyments: and now GOD had only taken what He had kindly for a Time be|&s;towed; he not only humbly &s;ubmits, but al&s;o retains the grateful Sen&s;e and <HI>Ble&s;&s;es the Name of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Things &s;eem plainly exhibited in the Ex|ample before us; and were doubtle&s;s written for our Imitation under the mo&s;t heavy <HI>Bereavements,</HI> whether of <HI>Children</HI> or <HI>Others,</HI> or of <HI>any Earthly De&s;ire</HI> whatever.</P>
<P>But from this latter Part of the Speech of <HI>Job,</HI> we may rai&s;e this</P>
<Q><HI>GENERAL DOCTRINE,</HI> That in our mo&s;t &s;ore Bereavements, we &s;hould not only with a humble Thankfulne&s;s and Submi&s;&s;ion own, that the <HI>LORD</HI> gave, and the <HI>LORD</HI> hath taken away; <HI>but al&s;o</HI> further labour after &s;uch rai&s;ed and amiable Views of <HI>GOD,</HI> as even to <HI>BLESS</HI> his Name.</Q>
<P N="1"><PB N="10" REF="005481_0008_10183A16A72B2D08">I. We &s;hould then with a humble <HI>Thankfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> own, that <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>hath given, and the</HI> LORD <HI>hath taken away.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;overeign Hand and Will of GOD mu&s;t needs be concerned in all Events. As He made every Thing, every <HI>Spirit</HI> and every <HI>Atom</HI> in Heaven and Earth; He formed them with wi&s;e De&s;igns, to fill up all their Pla|ces in his unbroken and con&s;ummate Scheme of Provi|dence. For his wi&s;e Plea&s;ure they were and are created. And as He Pre&s;erves them all, for his wi&s;e Plea&s;ure al&s;o they are Pre&s;erved. His Kingdom likewi&s;e ruleth over all, and his Dominion from Generation to Generation, even for ever. He made the whole <HI>Creation</HI> on Purpo&s;e for <HI>Dominion.</HI> And He is always equally Pre&s;ent every where, both to uphold and order even every <HI>Spirit</HI> of the <HI>&s;malle&s;t Animal,</HI> as well as the <HI>highe&s;t Arch-Angel;</HI> and every <HI>Atom,</HI> as well as the <HI>whole Globe of the Earth.</HI> It is equally ea&s;y to Him to uphold and govern continually as well as create the one as the other for wi&s;e De&s;igns: and there is not the lea&s;t among them but ever has its <HI>Influence</HI> as well as <HI>Place</HI> in his wide Dominion.</P>
<P>The SON of GOD a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>not a Sparrow falls to the Ground,</HI> or Dies, <HI>without Him,</HI> and that the <HI>Hairs of our Heads are all Numbered.</HI> Mat. x. Luke xii. So uni|ver&s;al and &s;o perfect is his &s;overeign Providence. All our Comforts and all our Troubles mu&s;t be ordered by Him. And when our dear Enjoyments are removed from us, we &s;hou'd then &s;ee and own his &s;overeign Hand both in Giving them to us and in Taking away.</P>
<P N="1">1. We &s;hou'd then with <HI>Thankfulne&s;s</HI> acknowledge, it is the LORD who <HI>Gave</HI> them.</P>
<P>As we came naked into the World, whatever Com|fort we have enjoyed &s;ince, we have received from Him; we have received it from his &s;upreme Will and Hand; and he has be&s;towed it on us as an unde&s;erved Gift, with perfect Freene&s;s and Liberality. Many of
<PB N="11" REF="005481_0009_101839DAFB818158">
our <HI>Earthly Goods</HI> may &s;eem to come by our own Fore|ca&s;t, Care and Indu&s;try, or the Hand of others; or by a great Variety of &s;econd Cau&s;es: But the&s;e are all com|prized within his Influence and Providence: It is HE that gives us Foreca&s;t and Power to get worldly Wealth or Honours: It is HE that orders tho&s;e innumerable Circum&s;tances that render our Contrivances, Cares and Labours pro&s;perous; or that &s;ometimes pro&s;pers us without them. It is HE al&s;o that gives us <HI>Children</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxxvii. 3.</NOTE> and <HI>other Relatives:</HI> It is HE that form'd them with their various Geniu&s;es, Powers and Plea&s;ancies: And 'tis HE that gives them their Accompli&s;hments, their Moral Virtues, and their Chri&s;tian Graces; and that makes them lovely and delightful to us.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, whatever Creature-Comfort we have enjoy|ed, we have received from the kind and giving Hand of GOD. And their <HI>Continuance</HI> to us al&s;o is as much his <HI>Giving,</HI> as when at fir&s;t Be&s;towed. We have been un|worthy of them every Moment: And as he has graci|ou&s;ly continued them, his <HI>continuing</HI> them has been a continued <HI>Giving</HI> them.</P>
<P>While He Gives them, we &s;hou'd then be con&s;tantly acknowledging his kind and unde&s;erved Gifts with <HI>Thankfulne&s;s:</HI> Nor &s;hou'd our <HI>Gratitude</HI> expire upon the Removal of them. When they are taken away, we &s;hou'd &s;till remember the Divine Benignity in Giving them at fir&s;t, and in Pre&s;erving them &s;o long: And we &s;hou'd al&s;o call to mind the Comfort we have received in them; not to increa&s;e our Sorrow, but in the mid&s;t of Sorrows, to keep alive the Sen&s;e of our Obligations and our due <HI>Thankfulne&s;s</HI> to him that Gave them.</P>
<P>And here we &s;hou'd con&s;ider the Gift of the&s;e Com|forts to us, as related to <HI>his wi&s;e Decree and Providence;</HI> that he Gave them in all their <HI>Kinds,</HI> their <HI>Mea&s;ures,</HI> and their <HI>Sea&s;ons;</HI> and in tho&s;e that were mo&s;t wi&s;e and fitting: that he gave them to be ju&s;t &s;uch Comforts to
<PB N="12" REF="005481_0010_10183A185ACA98C8">
us, as he has made them actually to be: and that he gave them to continue for &s;uch a Time as he has continued them, and not a Moment longer. <HI>Job</HI> vii. 1. &amp; xiv. 5.</P>
<P>In fine, that he had an ab&s;olute Right to Give them or not to Give them as he plea&s;ed: that he might have cho&s;en not to have Given them at all, or not to have made them &s;o agreable, or not to have Given us &s;o much Comfort in them, or not to have Given them for &s;o long a Sea&s;on: But every <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Duration</HI> of our <HI>Comfort</HI> in them is intirely owing to his &s;overeign Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. We &s;hou'd then acknowledge with <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> al&s;o, that the &s;ame LORD who <HI>Gave has Taken them away.</HI></P>
<P>What ever be the <HI>Means</HI> of their Removal, yet every Kind of Means is comprehended in his univer&s;al Pro|vidence. <HI>Shall there be Evil in the City, and the</HI> LORD <HI>hath not done it?</HI> Surely no. <HI>Amos</HI> iii. 6. <HI>I am the</HI> LORD, <HI>and there is none el&s;e: I form the Light, and create Dark|ne&s;s: I make Peace, and create Evil: I the</HI> LORD <HI>do all the&s;e Things.</HI> I&s;a. xlv. 6, 7. He does all the&s;e Things, either by his immediate or mediate Influence: either by him&s;elf; or by the inanimate Powers of Nature, which he ever upholds and governs; or by the holy Angels, who are the ready Doers of his &s;overeign Plea&s;ure; or by Men, or evil Angels whom he re&s;traineth, exciteth or permitteth as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the whole Creation are his In&s;truments in|tirely at his Di&s;po&s;al: They are ever under his wi&s;e Di|rection: And as <HI>He</HI> always <HI>does according to his Will</HI> among them, &s;o not any Comfort can be taken away without him. When they are removed from us, it is the &s;ame GOD who Gave that does it. He is the &s;overeign LORD who kindly Gave and made them &s;uch Comforts to us; who Gave them for &s;o long a Sea&s;on, not a Mo|ment longer; who had a Right to appoint the Sea&s;on, and therefore when that Sea&s;on ends, to Take them away.</P>
<P>For as a learned Man ob&s;erves; when <HI>Job</HI> confe&s;&s;es the LORD had <HI>Given,</HI> he &s;ignifies that GOD had &s;o
<PB N="13" REF="005481_0011_101839DC8A9EE710">
Given as to <HI>re&s;erve to Him&s;elf the full Propriety and Power over them:</HI> that he does not Give us the <HI>Property</HI> of them from him&s;elf; nor yet the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of them in any other Way than in intire Dependance on his &s;ove|reign Plea&s;ure. (<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Mercer <HI>in</HI> Job.</NOTE>)</P>
<P>The mo&s;t lowly Submi&s;&s;ion therefore is mo&s;t clearly due to GOD, in the mo&s;t &s;ore Bereavments of our Earthly Comforts. And in &s;uch Bereavements we &s;hou'd eye his Sovereign Hand and Plea&s;ure, bow down our Wills, and give up all our Scheams, Delights and Affections to Him in the&s;e trying Di&s;pen&s;ations. (The <HI>Septuagint</HI> here adds&mdash;<HI>as it plea&s;ed the</HI> LORD, <HI>&s;o it is done.</HI>) It be|ing the LORD <HI>who takes away,</HI> is <HI>Rea&s;on enough</HI> to &s;i|lence every murmurnig Di&s;po&s;ition, to calm our tumul|tuous Pa&s;&s;ions, and oblige us to re&s;ign Our&s;elves and our mo&s;t dear Enjoyments to his Sovereign Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>And we &s;hall both clearly &s;ee <HI>this Rea&s;on</HI> and feel <HI>this happy Efficacy</HI> of it; if we have believing Views of his adorable Perfections, his con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom, his &s;pot|le&s;s Holine&s;s, and Ju&s;tice, his abundant Kindne&s;s in and thorough CHRIST, his inviolable Truth, and our Cove|nant Intere&s;t in him. For then in Taking our deare&s;t Comforts from us, we &s;hall view him as acting in a righ|teous, holy, wi&s;e, gracious and faithful Manner: Correct|ing us indeed in his righteous, holy and fatherly Di&s;plea|&s;ure; but therewith in Wi&s;dom, Faithfulne&s;s and Lov|ing-kindne&s;s, for our greater pre&s;ent &amp; eternal Benefit.</P>
<P>Yea,</P>
<P N="2">II. In our mo&s;t grievous Bereavments, we &s;hou'd yet further labour after <HI>&s;uch rai&s;ed and amiable Views</HI> of GOD, as even <HI>to Ble&s;s his Name.</HI></P>
<P>So <HI>Job</HI> appears to ri&s;e in his pious Exerci&s;e, upon his &s;ore Bereavments.

to him in <HI>Giving</HI> and <HI>continuing</HI> his <HI>lo&s;t Enjoyments:</HI> Then he pa&s;&s;es on to a harder Work of Devotion &s;till, viz. <HI>Submi&s;&s;ively</HI> to yield to the Hand of GOD in <HI>Taking them away:</HI> And now he ri&s;es up to the Hight of Pi|ety, even under his oppre&s;&s;ive Grief, and with an eleva|ted Voice he clo&s;es his Adoration with <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing the Name of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>In this exalted Point of Piety he &s;eems to act, not only above, but even contrary to the genuine Re&s;ent|ments of Nature; as to <HI>Ble&s;s</HI> the LORD who had <HI>ju&s;t Taken away</HI> both his <HI>E&s;tate and Children,</HI> and this in a very &s;udden, awful and aggravated Manner. One wou'd think&mdash;a <HI>low Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the Sovereign Hand and Will that &s;mote him, was as much as genuine Pie|ty wou'd require or di&s;po&s;e him to. But <HI>immediately</HI> to <HI>Ble&s;s</HI> the SEVERE BEREAVER!&mdash;How can heavy Sor|row and chearful Ble&s;&s;ing ri&s;e from the &s;ame Heart and Mouth together? Surely &s;ome heavenly Rays of Light mu&s;t &s;hine into his gloomy Mind; and he mu&s;t have tho&s;e opening Views of GOD, as made him for a while forget his Sorrows, and fill'd his Soul with Con&s;olations.</P>
<P>A My&s;tery this &s;eems to the carnal World: But a Scene the Sanctified are no Strangers to: They often &s;ee it; they clearly under&s;tand it; and they can ea&s;ily un|fold it to one another. Their Graces work in every Pa&s;&s;ion and Affection: Their believing Views of GOD will ea&s;ily &s;et them all a moving: when their Views of GOD are lively, their Graces and Affections grow live|ly too: And a &s;ingle View of his tran&s;cendent Glory in the Face of CHRIST and of their Covenant Intere&s;t in Him; one &s;uch View as <HI>Job</HI>&mdash;when he &s;aid, <HI>I know that</HI> MY REDEEMER <HI>liveth,</HI> will in a Moment rai&s;e the Heart from the Depths of Sorrow and Mourning, above all the Views of Creatures, to the Heights of Joy and Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Some &s;uch View of GOD as this, it &s;eems was given to <HI>Job,</HI> while under his oppre&s;&s;ing Grief he is bowing down and wor&s;hipping his DIVINE CORRECTOR.

<P>And indeed a <HI>low Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the Sovereign GOD in dark and trying Di&s;pen&s;ations, is the very next Door to <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;port.</HI> Their great De&s;ign is to &s;ub|due the Will to <HI>his.</HI> The more hard the Trial, the more compleat the Conque&s;t: And the more compleat the Conque&s;t, the more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and calm the Soul; the turbulent Pa&s;&s;ions layed; the End of the Trial accompli&s;hed; and the peaceful and humble Soul pre|pared for tho&s;e amiable and rai&s;ed Views of GOD in CHRIST, and e&s;pecially as <HI>Ours,</HI> which will excite our Joy and move to Ble&s;s him.</P>
<P>How can the Soul di&s;turbed with un&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Pa&s;|&s;ions under his afflictive Hand, have <HI>amiable</HI> Appre|hen&s;ions of him?

from ri&s;ing higher in our Views of GOD: But even tho&s;e Contemplations of him which give us &s;uch a plea&s;ing Satisfaction in his grievous Dealings with us, will incline our Minds to the more intentive Contem|plations on him: And the more we view him, the more we &s;hall di&s;cover of his tran&s;cendant Excellence, and the higher will our Plea&s;ure ri&s;e, to excite our Thankfulne&s;s and Prai&s;es.</P>

<P>Thus have we made a few Reflections on the anci|ent and becoming Example here exhibited, for our In&s;truction and Direction in our &s;ore Bereavements. A great Number of other Particulars might be ob&s;er|ved: But the Subject is very copious, and the Heads we have mentioned are comprehen&s;ive of them.</P>
<P>And now for &s;uch an IMPROVEMENT as the&s;e Things wou'd lead us to. It wou'd ea&s;ily &s;pread into various Branches: But the <HI>Sum</HI> of them all may be reduced to <HI>This</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Let us Labour in our Bereavements to Go and Do &s;o likewi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>And in Order to &s;uch a Behaviour, here we &s;ee the great Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Faith,</HI> even <HI>that vital Faith</HI> which is from a Divine Operation, and of the lively Exerci&s;e thereof in our Contemplations on the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD in the Times of our Bereavements. For 'tis this <HI>Faith</HI> in
<PB N="18" REF="005481_0016_10183A24D151B358">
<HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> that gives our Souls the Evidence of HIM who is invi&s;ible. It gives the evident Di&s;covery of his in|vi&s;ible Glories in the Face of CHRIST, to the contemp|lating Mind: And when we come to &s;ee them, they will rai&s;e our Souls above our mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Sorrows, they will fill us with Contentment in Him: Yea they will in&s;pire with Joy; they'l make the Soul exult, break forth in Prai&s;e and Ble&s;s his Name.</P>
<P>And the more my&s;terious and dark his Providences, the more we need to rai&s;e our Minds from Things be|low to the believing Contemplations of this Highe&s;t and mo&s;t Glorious Being. When we look on Things Below, a thick and melancholly Darkne&s;s encompa&s;&s;es us about, which affects our Minds with Sorrow and &s;inks them in Dejection: But when we look up to GOD, and fix our Eyes on him, as he appears in CHRIST; we &s;ee in him a glorious Light, to chear our Spirits and rai&s;e them up to a perfect Satisfaction in him. He was ab&s;olutely happy from Eternity without any Creature; and &s;urely in HIM <HI>we</HI> may be happy al&s;o, though be|reaved of every other Being. He need only unvail his Glories in the Face of CHRIST, to convince us of it and make us feel it. All Things in Earth and Heaven are nothing to him: As we come to know him, we clearly &s;ee it: And the more we know him, the le&s;s we e&s;teem the mo&s;t lovely Creatures in Compari&s;on with him, and the higher we ri&s;e in our Admirations of him, and grow in Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In fine, by the lively <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> in the Con|templations of him, we bring the delightful Vi&s;ion of his Glories into our Minds; he opens them to us, to our Wonder and Complacency; we come even here into the &s;en&s;ible Enjoyment of him; we come into a &s;atisfying Experience of our Intere&s;t in him; and our Hearts and Tongues can Ble&s;s and Prai&s;e him in the Lo&s;s of all Things here below.</P>

<P>As &s;he grew up, he was pleas'd to re&s;train her from youthful Vanities, to make her &s;erious, and move her to &s;tudy the BIBLE and the be&s;t of <HI>Authors</HI> both of <HI>Hi&s;to|ry</HI> and <HI>Divinity:</HI> Among the latter of which, Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Row</HI>'s Writings were very agreeable and familiar to Her.

enabling her, as &s;he hoped, to repent of her Sins and for&s;ake them; to look on CHRIST as a compleat Redeemer; to renounce her own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and depend on his only; and making her willing to accept Him as offer'd in the Go&s;pel, as her Prophet, Prie&s;t and King, to in&s;truct, intercede for and rule over Her.</Q></P>
<P>Upon this &s;he was de&s;irous of Renewing her Cove|nant in <HI>Publick,</HI> and coming up to <HI>all his Ordinances:</HI> But Apprehen&s;ions of her own Unworthine&s;s and Fears of Eating and Drinking Judgment to her&s;elf, di&s;cou|rag'd and prevented her; till <HI>July</HI> 18. 1739, when &s;he narrowly e&s;caped being drowned in her Father's Bo|&s;ome.

Some Peo|ple blam'd Her, as being over-diligent and eager: But &s;he had <HI>Salvation</HI> and <HI>Eternity</HI> in View, went on &s;teadi|ly without regarding &s;uch Sugge&s;tions, &s;eemed to grow dead to the pre&s;ent World, and to mind nothing &s;o much as to <HI>make</HI> her <HI>Calling and Election &s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s &s;earching Preaching rai&s;ed in Her, as in many Others, a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>con&s;tant Jealou&s;y</HI> of being <HI>Deceived:</HI> And upon every &s;piritual Declen&s;ion, a Cloud of Darkne&s;s overwhelm'd her and inclin'd her to judge &s;he <HI>was.</HI> His in&s;i&s;ting al&s;o that without <HI>&s;anc|tifying Grace,</HI> our BLESSED SAVIOUR gives none a <HI>Right</HI> to Partake at his <HI>Table,</HI> occa&s;ioned her much Perplexity. For from thence &s;he argued; that unle&s;s &s;he <HI>knew</HI> &s;he had <HI>&s;anctifying Grace,</HI> &s;he cou'd not <HI>know</HI>&s;he had a <HI>Right:</HI> And to Partake without <HI>knowing</HI> &s;he had a <HI>Right,</HI> would be not to Partake in <HI>Faith,</HI> but in <HI>Pre&s;umption,</HI> and this &s;he had no Right to do. And hence when Doubts of her State of Grace aro&s;e, &s;he dare not Participate; but onty attended with De&s;ire, and I believe with deep Regret and Self-aba&s;ement. So though her <HI>Jealou&s;ies</HI> and <HI>Fears</HI> were trouble&s;ome; I am apt to think they were u&s;eful; not only to make her Look more into and &s;ee her&s;elf, and make her more broken, humble, and careful, but al&s;o excite her Prayers and Labours after livelier Degrees of Grace and the clearer Evidence of it.</P>

For I think &s;he &s;hould have humbly received every Comfort which the Sovereign GOD by the <HI>Scriptures</HI> offered her; to excite her Thankfulne&s;s, Love, Prai&s;e and Zeal, En|couragement to go on in her Chri&s;tian Cour&s;e, and Care to guard again&s;t ungrateful Negligence and Security.</P>
<P>In her <HI>lively and plea&s;ant Frames</HI> &s;he wrote down her happy <HI>Idaeas,</HI> and they were her choice&s;t Writings;

<P>But I now come to her <HI>Sickne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Tue&s;day, May</HI> 29, &s;he was &s;eized on a &s;udden with a <HI>&s;low Fever:</HI> And upon going up to her Cham|ber drop'd a Word, as if &s;he &s;hould never come down alive.</P>
<P>From the Beginning &s;he was much more apprehen|&s;ive of <HI>Danger</HI> than any el&s;e: And though concerned about her Soul; yet complained of her Stupidity, Hard|ne&s;s of Heart, Blindne&s;s of Mind, Impenitence and Un|belief; cen&s;uring and condemning her&s;elf of all Good, denying &s;he had any &s;anctifying Grace, but judging &s;he had been deceiving Her&s;elf with the counterfeit Re|&s;emblance of it.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Fever</HI> continued without Intermi&s;&s;ion for about a <HI>Month:</HI> And then becoming <HI>Hectical,</HI> per&s;evered with &s;ome &s;mall Abatements in the former Part of the Day; and then ri&s;ing higher in the <HI>Afternoons</HI> and <HI>Nights</HI> to a terrible Degree until &s;he expired.</P>
<P>Though &s;he had &s;everal &s;urprizing Turns when &s;he thought &s;he was Dying; yet I &s;aw no very dangerous Symptoms 'till <HI>Lord's-Day, July</HI> 1, at my Returning Home from the <HI>Afternoon</HI> Exerci&s;e: when &s;he was grown &s;o ill that we apprehended &s;he was ha&s;tening to her great Change, and her Mother thought Her&s;elf o|bliged in Faithfulne&s;s to tell her our Apprehen&s;ion. Upon which &s;he thank'd her for the Kindne&s;s; but quickly fell into <HI>great Di&s;tre&s;s</HI> in the awakening Views of a <HI>near Eternity</HI> and her being unprepared for it. With Agony &s;he cried &mdash;<Q>O I am ju&s;t going into E|TERNITY! And I have no Intere&s;t in CHRIST, and I can't Submit, I can't Believe! O what &s;hall I do!

O Dear Sir, What &s;hall I do! &amp;c.</Q> I told Her, <Q>There was no other Way, but to condemn Her&s;elf at the Foot of the All&s;ufficient and compa&s;&s;ionate REDEEMER, and there to lie and die imploring the Mercy he offered; and if &s;he did &s;o, I believ'd He would in no wi&s;e ca&s;t her off or let her peri&s;h.</Q>&mdash; It would brake a Heart of Stone to hear her! And O the Horror of <HI>that Night!</HI> It was one of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing I ever knew!</P>
<P>We were afraid of her Dying all that Night. When I was obliged to leave her that &s;he might get &s;ome Re&s;t, I ordered the Watcher, as at other Times, to call me, if there &s;hould be any Alteration: And when I came to Her early in the <HI>Morning,</HI> I found her ex|ceeding ill, weakened and di&s;couraged; and that being re&s;tle&s;s &s;he had not &s;lept a Wink, being afraid of clo&s;|ing her Eyes, lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould &s;uddenly open into <HI>E|ternity.</HI> But after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e and Prayers, &s;he was per&s;waded to re&s;ign Her&s;elf into the Arms of JE|SUS, compo&s;ed her&s;elf to re&s;t, and &s;lept: And upon a|waking was a little refre&s;hed; which I improv'd to en|courage her.</P>
<P>However, her awful <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> &s;till continued. And though I rea&s;oned with her about her <HI>former Experience,</HI> yet all in vain. <Q>O Dear Father, (&s;aid &s;he) you have better Apprehen&s;ions of me than you &s;hould have: You don't know what a vile Creature I am: I have dreadfully apo&s;tatized from CHRIST, have grown ex|ceeding negligent of religious Duties, and was return|ing to the World again.</Q> I told her, we did not perceive it; that I could not &s;ee tho&s;e Decays &s;he &s;poke of, to be incon&s;i&s;tent with a regenerate State, though they were Matter of deep Aba&s;ement, and &s;he &s;hould have a Care &s;he denied not the gracious Work of GOD within Her. <Q>She beg'd me not to &s;peak to her nor Pray for her as a <HI>converted</HI> Per&s;on, but as a wretched, <HI>unconverted Sinner;</HI> who had clo&s;ed with CHRIST from meerly &s;en&s;itive and &s;elfi&s;h Motives, as Fear

of <HI>Hell,</HI> and not from the highe&s;t Apprehen&s;ion and Love of HIM as mo&s;t de&s;ireable to &s;ee and enjoy.</Q></P>
<P>I told Her CHRIST as a compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour had revealed <HI>Hell</HI> to us on Purpo&s;e, that we might be afraid of it, and by the Fear be mov'd to fly to him to &s;ave us from it; and this mu&s;t therefore be a dutiful Com|pliance with his gracious Purpo&s;e; that this Kindne&s;s in di&s;covering <HI>Hell,</HI> with his Concern and Willingne&s;s to &s;ave us from it, is a Part of his Amiablene&s;s, for which we ought to love and embrace him; though we &s;hould indeed be excited al&s;o with the higher Motives of <HI>his Per&s;onal Excellencies:</HI> But by her former Expe|rience, it &s;eem'd to me, &s;he had clo&s;ed with him from the Views of the&s;e as well as the other. &mdash; <Q>She could not deny that &s;he had &s;ometimes thought &s;o; but could &s;ee nothing of his Loveline&s;s now, and conclu|ded &s;he had been deceived.</Q></P>
<P>I al&s;o argued from her Love to the Hou&s;e and Word of GOD, and to his People and Mini&s;ters; from her peculiar Love to Tho&s;e whom &s;he apprehended to be mo&s;t eminent for vital Piety; e&s;pecially tho&s;e Mini|&s;ters who mo&s;t laid open the Hypocri&s;y of the Hearts of Men, who made the Hypocrites and Formali&s;ts the mo&s;t unea&s;y, and were mo&s;t zealous for the Power of Godline&s;s: From her bitter Mourning we were Wit|ne&s;&s;es of for the Lo&s;s of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooper,</HI> though &s;he was neither related to, nor acquainted with Him any otherwi&s;e than by a diligent Hearing his Lectures; but only becau&s;e of his Eminence in Piety, Preaching, and Activity in Promoting the Doctrines of Grace, the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, Edification of Converts, and therein the Cau&s;e of CHRIST: <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Her younger Si&s;ter had al&s;o ju&s;t been telling me; that the Day after Mr. <HI>Cooper</HI> Died, <HI>this Elde&s;t Si&s;ter</HI> had &s;uch an awful View of the <HI>Anger</HI> of GOD therein, as &s;he was hardly able to bear up under it. I did not in&s;i&s;t on her aggravated Sorrow for the Lo&s;s of her Rev.

her Choice of pious Companions, and other hopeful Signs of Grace: But all to no Purpo&s;e. And though the Rev. Dr. <HI>Sewall</HI> likewi&s;e laboured to re&s;olve her Scruples, we found that none but the AL|MIGHTY Him&s;elf could do it: Though we believed her to be a Child of GOD, yet if HIS SPIRIT did not <HI>witne&s;s</HI> with her Spirit that &s;he was &s;o, &s;he could not &s;ee it, nor could we help her to the View, and to Him we were oblig'd to leave it. Dr. <HI>Sewall</HI> ob&s;erving to me, from his former Acquaintance with her, that if &s;he &s;hou'd die in Darkne&s;s, we &s;hould have good Ground to hope, that GOD had given her Grace and wou'd take her to Glory.</P>
<P>I then chang'd the Tenor of my di&s;cour&s;ing from Day to Day: And <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing &s;he were not converted,</HI> repre|&s;ented her Ca&s;e as indeed very dreadful, but not as de|&s;perate: And at &s;everal Times, as &s;he was through grievous Illne&s;s able to bear, endeavoured to &s;et before her the infinite Fountain of Mercy and Grace in GOD; how this Fountain is open, free, and eternally overflow|ing thorough CHRIST even to the chief of Sinners; how he delights in overflowing; how He thereby glo|rifies every Per&s;on in the Godhead, both FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT; and how he would be &s;o far from loo&s;ing any Glory, that he would glorify more of his Perfecti|ons in Forgiving and Saving her, than in Rejecting and Damning her. I endeavoured al&s;o to &s;et before her the wondrous Pity, Conde&s;cen&s;ion, Offices, Humiliation, Suf|ferings, Sacrifice, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Merits, Exaltation, Glo|ry, Power, Grace, Calls and Promi&s;es of CHRIST; how touched with a Fellow-Feeling of her Infirmities and Mi|&s;eries; how tenderly compa&s;&s;ionate; how open his Arms; how earne&s;tly inviting and intreating; how ready to receive her, be&s;tow his Righteou&s;ne&s;s on her, intercede for and reconcile her to the HOLY GOD: That one &s;in|gle Interce&s;&s;ion of his would &s;ave her Eternally: He need only &s;ay, 'O DIVINE FATHER! <HI>Here is a poor guilty, wretched, peri&s;hing and rained Sinner; for my

Sake be reconciled to her;'</HI> and GOD would be recon|ciled immediately, that very Moment: That CHRIST only waited for her <HI>coming</HI> towards him; and as the Father of the Prodigal, he would even run immediate|ly to meet and embrace her, intercede for and reconcile her, yea be&s;tow HIMSELF, his SPIRIT and all his Bene|fits and Graces on her.</P>
<P>She would reply&mdash;'O &s;he could not come to CHRIST, '&s;he could not tru&s;t in Him, &s;he could not believe, &amp;c.

<P>My Dear People, You mu&s;t needs be &s;en&s;ible of the great Di&s;tre&s;s of a Father's Heart, putting his Soul in her Soul's Place, for &s;o many Weeks together.</P>

who dearly loved her: But they all till the <HI>la&s;t half Hour of her Life</HI> &s;eem'd unan&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>Some were per&s;waded GOD would not remove her, till he gave her Light and Peace and Joy in Believing. And <HI>the&s;e two Things</HI> e&s;pecially, were Matter of Thank|fulne&s;s, of Hope and Comfort to us: (1.) That GOD was pleas'd to continue to her all along, when &s;he was quite awake, the clear Exerci&s;e of her Under&s;tanding; as al&s;o great Calmne&s;s and Compo&s;ure, unle&s;s now and then in &s;ome &s;udden Apprehen&s;ion of Dying: (2.) That he was al&s;o plea&s;ed to enable her con&s;tantly to bare his Hand, with Meekne&s;s, Patience and Humility; condemning and aba&s;ing her&s;elf, and Ju&s;tifying him; yea almo&s;t continually, upon the &s;malle&s;t In&s;tances of Bodily Relief, or Kindne&s;s of others, tenderly repea|ting it&mdash;<HI>O how Good is GOD!&mdash;O how Good is GOD!</HI>&mdash;And &s;o running up every Comfort to HIM.</P>
<P>But in &s;uch perplexing Darkne&s;s &s;he continued 'till <HI>Friday July</HI> 20 about <HI>Sun&s;et,</HI> when with Surprize &s;he entered the Valley of the Shadow of Death.</P>
<P>About 5 in the <HI>Afternoon,</HI> I was ha&s;tily called up, and found her in great Di&s;tre&s;s for Want of Breath: And no Doubt &s;he was actually Dying, though it was hid|den from me. I fir&s;t a&s;k'd her, <Q>If &s;he was yet ena|bled to Re&s;ign to the Di&s;po&s;e and Arms of CHRIST?</Q> She Replied&mdash;<HI>She hoped &s;he was in a great Mea&s;ure:</HI> Which was more than I had yet heard from her. Af|ter Prayer and &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he was a little reliev'd, and we left her to compo&s;e her&s;elf to Sleep. But &s;leep|ing a few Minutes; about 6, &s;he waked in the &s;trong Agonies of Death, and was in great Agonies all the while Dr. <HI>Sewall</HI> was Praying, and the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> was with Her: But Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, in her full Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>When they had left her I told her, the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> &s;aid he could do no more: And we mu&s;t re&s;ign her to the Arms of Mercy. Upon this &s;he &s;urprizingly and calm|ly compos'd her&s;elf to Die: But now had no Strength to &s;peak; and her Breath failing, &s;he &s;hut her Eyes,

and &s;eem'd to be dying away. And now was the mo&s;t di&s;mal Time of all!&mdash; To &s;ee her depart in Darkne&s;s, without any Gleam of Light or Comfort!&mdash;And look|ing on her, I &s;aid; <Q>Dear Child! we &s;hall never hear her &s;peak one Word more!</Q></P>
<P>O the Di&s;tre&s;s in the Room!&mdash; But in the Hight thereof, while I was holding her Arm in my Hands; in 3 <HI>or</HI> 4 <HI>Minutes,</HI> to our great Surprize, &s;he opened her Eyes: And recovering a &s;mall Mea&s;ure of Breath, with an inward interrupted Speech, through great Dif|ficulty for Want of Breath and Strength, &s;he had ju&s;t Time to whi&s;per to me in a new Language; which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, exerting her&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, and &s;o as to be plainly heard by 4 or 5 who were neare&s;t to her.&mdash;'<HI>O I love the</HI> LORD JESUS <HI>with all my Heart!

<P>All the while &s;he &s;aid the&s;e Things in the burning Exerci&s;e of Love to CHRIST and <HI>Souls,</HI> I felt the &s;trong Convul&s;ions and trembling Agonies of Death in her Arm: and as &s;oon as ever &s;he had fini&s;hed her &s;aid Wi&s;h

For <HI>me</HI> in particular that I may be excited to more earne&s;t Labours for your eternal Salvation; May be enabled to an&s;wer the <HI>affectionate

Wi&s;h of my Dying Child;</HI> and that the SPIRIT of GOD may greatly quicken and pro&s;per me, with my Dear and Rev. Colleague in the whole of our Mini&s;try! And may the LORD abundantly Reward you both in &s;piri|tual and temporal Ble&s;&s;ings: And in particular give both to you and yours the mo&s;t de&s;ireable Light of his Countenance in your dying Moments.</P>
<P>But I can not tell how to end my Sermon without a plain Addre&s;s to you all, in the particular Characters of <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. To tho&s;e who are <HI>Parents.</HI></P>
<P>O both now and con&s;tantly con&s;ider, <HI>your Children</HI> have immortal Souls, but very frail and dying Bodies: That they are ha&s;tening to Death and Eternity: That their pre&s;ent Life is the only Time of Preparation for them, and this Time is utterly uncertain: That as GOD has graciou&s;ly given them to you, He has com|mitted their mo&s;t precious Souls to your &s;pecial Care, He will require them of you, and now is the only Sea|&s;on you are certain of, to labour in their Preparation for that Eternity and Judgment they are ha&s;tening to.</P>
<P>O! do you not love <HI>your Children?</HI> Do you not pity them under their temporal Afflictions? And are you not ready to do and &s;uffer any Thing for their tempo|ral Comfort, which is but for a few uncertain Moments? And don't you love their immortal <HI>Souls?</HI> Don't you pity them under the terrible Wrath and Cur&s;e of GOD, and the de&s;troying Power of Sin and Satan? And can you quietly &s;ee and let them go on in Sin or Vanity, or Neglect of CHRIST, and &s;o down to <HI>Hell?</HI> Are any of you willing they &s;hould de&s;cend to that dreadful Place, and there among Devils and damned Wretches, for ever cry and cur&s;e you, for your cruel Negligence to &s;ave them from that Gulf of Horror.</P>
<P>If a <HI>Child</HI> of any among you be There already, or &s;hould be There hereafter through your Neglect; O how horrible the Guilt, how bitter the Reflection! And if you &s;hould be damned with them too; O what a
<PB N="35" REF="005481_0033_10183A01ADC41850">
horrid Welcome will they give you, when you go down to them into the Infernal Regions! and how in|&s;ufferably upbraid you before the World in the long Day of Judgment, and the Eternity thereafter!</P>
<P>O therefore, now &s;tir up your&s;elves to improve the pre&s;ent Time to &s;ecure them from endle&s;s Mi&s;ery. Tell them of the glorious Perfections of GOD who made, upholds, defends them; gives them every Comfort; ob&s;erves, di&s;po&s;es of and will &s;urely judge them. Tell them of the Word of GOD, of his righteous, holy, &s;pi|ritual and exten&s;ive Law; of the fearful Threatenings and Cur&s;es in it; of Death and Judgment, Heaven, Hell, Eternity. Tell them of their immortal Souls; of their Sinfulne&s;s, Guilt and Impotence; and of their condemned, dangerous and undone Condition. Tell them of the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of Renovation by the HOLY SPIRIT; of the All-&s;ufficiency and Wil|lingne&s;s of CHRIST to reconcile them to GOD and &s;ave them. Tell them who CHRIST is, and what He has done and &s;uffered on Earth, and what He is Doing in Heaven for their Redemption and Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Do what you can to &s;et him forth in all his Offices, his Benefits and Glories. Tell them of the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of Repenting and Believing in Him. Put them on Reading the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> and the mo&s;t ex|perimental and &s;earching Writers: In all appointed Ways endeavour to lead them to the Dear REDEEMER: And never cea&s;e to Pray and Labour, 'till you &s;ee his Image formed in them.</P>
<P N="2">2. To you the <HI>Children</HI> both Younger and Elder.</P>
<P>O Dear <HI>Children!</HI> You plainly &s;ee, you may <HI>Dye</HI> in Youth; and when you Dye you go into <HI>Eternity.</HI> GOD has made you for Eternity; he will bring you to Eternity; and when to bring you to it, wholly depends on his Sovereign Plea&s;ure. Your younge&s;t Age, your greate&s;t Strength and Health, your Merriment and Con|fidence, are no Security: nor can the Skill of the be&s;t Phy&s;icians, nor the Power of Medicines, nor your mo&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="005481_0034_10183A40601F6768">
piteous Cries, nor the mo&s;t earne&s;t Prayers of others, &s;ecure you from Death or Eternity in your early Days. But tho&s;e of you who now think your&s;elves the furthe&s;t off, may be the neare&s;t to them.</P>
<P>And O! If any of you &s;hould be &s;urpriz'd this Week, or in any other, when you expect it not, with &s;ome fatal and di&s;tracting Sickne&s;s unprepared; O what can you then do? It plea&s;ed GOD indeed to give my Child the Exerci&s;e of her Under&s;tanding all the while: But O how many others are &s;oon after they are taken, deprived of theirs? And this may be the Ca&s;e with you. In the Name of CHRIST I warn you of it: And in his dear Name I warn you now to de|lay no longer, but now and from this Time forward do your utmo&s;t to con&s;ider and &s;ee your dreadful Sinful|ne&s;s and Danger; and look and &s;eek and cry uncea&s;ing|ly to Him, to &s;how them to you and by <HI>Renewing</HI> you to &s;ave you from them.</P>
<P>He &s;ees you in all your Wretchedne&s;s: He pities you mo&s;t tenderly: He is loth that you &s;hould peri&s;h: His Arms are open ready to embrace you: He by me now calls you to him: He calls aloud: He calls a|gain. O if he were here in Fle&s;h; how kindly would he look upon you! How would he &s;tretch his Hands out towards you! How would he call you with a Flood of Tears! How rejoice in &s;eeing you moving towards Him! And how greatly would his Heart be grieved with your refu&s;ing to come to Him, that you might be &s;aved and be his forever!</P>
<P>O will you at length now hear him? Will you now re&s;olve that you'l &s;light him no longer? Will you now yield to his melting Calls? Will you now Reply&mdash;<Q>O Deare&s;t JESUS! I will &s;light Thee no more! I will deny Thee no longer! I am willing to be thine! I de&s;ire to be thine, and that Thou may&s;t be mine, in|tirely and for ever! O I look to Thee! I come to Thee! I try to come! I give my&s;elf to thee! Thou LORD JESUS, ha&s;t at la&s;t made me willing! Thou

ha&s;t rai&s;ed the&s;e De&s;ires in me! And O now an&s;wer them! Now take me to be thine! O renew my Heart, and come into it, and dwell and reign in it as thine own for ever! And I will for ever Love and Prai&s;e Thee!</Q></P>
<P>To conclude his pre&s;ent Calls&mdash;If you thus comply, O then CHRIST is yours, and all his Benefits are yours, and Death is yours, and Heaven is yours, Eternity is yours, and GOD is yours; They are yours for ever.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Cou&s;in,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Receiv'd your loving Letter <HI>April</HI> 2, and am much oblig'd to you for your kind Coun&s;els and Cautions. Indeed the Founda|tion on which we build our Hopes of eternal Happine&s;s being of the utmo&s;t Importance, de&s;erves our greate&s;t Care and Solicitude.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="005481_0037_10183A068CCC7570">Tho&s;e Foundations which you rightly ob&s;erved the mo&s;t build up|on, are equally fal&s;e and dangerous. No my dear Cou&s;in, nothing but the mo&s;t <HI>perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of CHRIST, imputed to us and re|ceived by Faith alone, can ju&s;tify us in the Sight of GOD; and <HI>his inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> wrought in us, can make us capable of injoying God in this or the next World. 'Tis on this Foundation I build all my Hope of Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>All my own Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are but as filthy Rags. My be&s;t Duties are &s;pecious Sins, guilded Iniquities. Every Action an un|regenerate Man performs is Sin. I u&s;ed very much to wonder what was meant by &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e: But &s;ince GOD has of his &s;overeign Grace and Mercy been plea&s;ed to open mine Eyes, and &s;hewn me the Vilene&s;s of mine own Heart, that corrupt Fountain from whence all the Streams of evil Actions flow; I have &s;een that (as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> &s;ays) <HI>by Nature I am half a Devil and half a Bea&s;t;</HI> I <HI>know that in me, that is in my Fle&s;h, dwells no good Thing.</HI> No, the <HI>Heart of Man is evil, and only evil continually,</HI> 'till it is changed by Divine Grace: And <HI>a corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit.</HI> No, every Action of a natural Man, however good in it &s;elf; yet in the <HI>Manner</HI> of Performance, is &s;tain'd and defiled with &s;o much Sin, as mu&s;t needs render it abominable to the pure and holy GOD. I wonder how any Body can think to merit by any Thing they can do; when all is polluted with Sin. Alas, <HI>we are not &s;uffi|cient of our&s;elves &s;o much as to think a good Thought, but all our Suffi|ciency is of GOD.</HI> And if we could perform any one Action after a perfect Manner, we could not merit by it, becau&s;e it is our Duty to do &s;o: Much le&s;s when we can do nothing without Sin. O what Need have we to fly to the <HI>perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of CHRIST, and lay hold upon it by Faith! This, this will cover all our Nakedne&s;s. But we mu&s;t throw away all our filthy Rags, before we can be clad with <HI>this white Raiment.</HI> We mu&s;t part not only with our <HI>Sins,</HI> but with our <HI>Duties</HI> as to putting our <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> in them, and placing our <HI>Dependance</HI> on them. Yea, <HI>this</HI> mu&s;t be upon CHRIST alone. This alone will &s;tand the Storms of Per&s;ecution. O my dear Cou&s;in! Let us build upon this Rock, and the Gates of Hell &s;hall never pre|vail again&s;t us. And we mu&s;t be &s;ure not to make a <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> of our <HI>Duties.</HI> How apt are we to do it? But if we are not willing to part with every Thing for CHRIST, we cannot be his Di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>O my dear Cou&s;in! Pray, pray, pray for me; that my Faith fail not; that I may be willing to part with every Thing for his Sake when he calls me to it. I am &s;ure <HI>one Moment's</HI> Sen&s;e of his Love will make amends for all. What then will an <HI>Eternity</HI> do? O when I think of <HI>Eternity,</HI> I am lo&s;t! After Ten Thou&s;and Thou&s;and Thou&s;and Years are pa&s;t, it is but begun. &mdash; But I mu&s;t con|clude with my hearty Prayers for the Welfare of your immortal Soul; and de&s;iring yours in Return, Your loving Cou&s;in,</P>

<HEAD>Another LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Cou&s;in,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT's the Matter you will not &s;ay one Word to me? Are you offended? at what? Come my Cou&s;in, let us live in Love and Peace, that &s;o the GOD of Love and Peace may dwell with us. I'll a&s;&s;ure you I am &s;o far from being offended with you, that I love you better than ever, and would do any Thing in my Power for your Good, e&s;pecially for the Good of your Soul.</P>
<P>O my dear, I am afraid you &s;et your Heart too much upon the Vanities of this World. O what are all Things under the Sun? Nothing but Vanity and Vexation of Spirit. Here's nothing capa|ble of &s;atisfying the De&s;ires of an humane Soul. No here's no|thing but <HI>Hu&s;ks:</HI> But in our Father's Hou&s;e is Bread enough and to &s;pare. Let us then ari&s;e and go to our Father for this Bread of Life; without which we mu&s;t eternally peri&s;h.</P>
<P>O my dear, let me earne&s;tly intreat you to come to CHRIST. O you can't think what a compa&s;&s;ionate and tender Father he is, unle&s;s you have felt his Love. If you have, you have felt the Meaning of tho&s;e tender Expre&s;&s;ions of the Spou&s;e; <HI>My Beloved is white and ruddy the Chiefe&s;t among Ten Thou&s;and, and he is altogether lovely:</HI> You know what it is to rejoice in him, and in his Love. <HI>How much better is thy Love than Wine,</HI> O mo&s;t dear REDEEMER! What's all the Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e, when compared to the&s;e exalted Plea&s;ures that flow from his right-Hand? One Smile of his Face is worth ten Thou&s;and Worlds. One Moment's Ta&s;te of his Love is more plea&s;ant than an Eternity &s;pent in &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures. O &s;ometimes I long to be di&s;&s;olved, and to be with CHRIST. I would not live here always if I might in this World of Sin. But I de&s;ire to &s;ub|mit to my heavenly Father's Will: if I may but be kept from the Pollutions of this World, and have Grace to re&s;i&s;t and overcome the Temptations of it.</P>
<P>O I mo&s;t earne&s;tly beg your Prayers for me: that GOD by his SPIRIT would &s;anctify me wholly in Spirit Soul and Body; that &s;o I may be prepared to glorify him here, and enjoy him for ever in Heaven In which ble&s;&s;ed Place may you and I meet and rejoice together forever <HI>Amen.</HI> I conclude, praying the be&s;t of Ble&s;&s;ings may re&s;t upon you, Your loving Cou&s;in,</P>
