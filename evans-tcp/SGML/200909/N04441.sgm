<P>THE <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> in our Text, with great Engagedne&s;s of Affection, excites and &s;ummoneth all around him to give to God the Glory of his Goodne&s;s, to prai&s;e and thank God for his wondrous endu|ring Mercy to his Church and People in Particular: That <HI>God's Mercy endureth forever</HI> is the Burden of this devout and affectionate Song of Prai&s;e, which being frequently re|peated, adds Beauty and Energy to it, as well as &s;erves to in|form us of the thankful Notice we &s;hould take of every In|&s;tance of divine Goodne&s;s, and to &s;hew how much we &s;hould be fill'd with <HI>Wonder,</HI> and fir'd with <HI>Gratitude</HI> when we re|flect upon the long Continuance thereof, to us guilty worth|le&s;s Creatures. But in the mean Time, &s;ingular In&s;tances of divine Mercy, loudly call for our mo&s;t inten&s;e and grate|ful Acknowledgments, and this &s;eems to be the Sen&s;e and Scope of the Words that I have now cho&s;en to in&s;i&s;t upon.</P>
<P>But to make them ea&s;ier to be under&s;tood, and prepare them for Improvement, let us enquire.</P>

</LIST>
<P>But before I proceed to an&s;wer the Que&s;tions propos'd, I &s;hall beg leave to premi&s;e the&s;e few Words, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Mercy,</HI> as to its general Nature, is Kindne&s;s vouch&s;afed to the mi&s;erable, and that a <HI>Wonder of Mercy</HI> is &s;ome un|common In&s;tance of Kindne&s;s; to Effect which the Al|mighty goes out of the ordinary Road of his providential Proceedings with Mankind: They are therefore call'd Won|ders, becau&s;e being of an extraordinary Nature, they de|&s;erve and are wont to excite Wonder or Admiration in tho&s;e that behold or hear of them. But I proceed to an&s;wer the</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Enquiry, which is this, <HI>What are the Wonders of Mercy which Almighty God works for his Church and People?</HI> And here more generally let it be ob&s;erv'd,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, That the Almighty hath di&s;appointed great and deep Plots, artfully formed again&s;t his Church. Thus when <HI>Haman</HI> as cunningly as cruelly contriv'd the utter ruin of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church and Nation, and that under the fal&s;e Pretext of their not keeping the King's Laws, it plea&s;ed <HI>Jehovah</HI> to baffle his Devi&s;e effectually, and that by a &s;mall but &s;urpri&s;ing Incident, one Night the King could not re&s;t till he had read in the Book of the <HI>Chronicles</HI> of <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s Loyalty in di&s;covering a trea&s;onable Con&s;piracy again&s;t his Life (<HI>E&s;t.</HI> vi.) This effectually over&s;et the whole Scheme, which i&s;&s;ued in the De&s;truction of proud and invidious <HI>Haman,</HI> &s;o that he was hang'd on the Gal|lows he had prepar'd for <HI>Mordecai,</HI> the mark of his Am|bitious Rage. (<HI>E&s;t.</HI> vii. 10)</P>
<P>Another In&s;tance much like this we have in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Daniel,</HI> the Nobles that wanted to ruin him, knowing that they could not find any Occa&s;ion again&s;t him, except|ing it were concerning the law of his God, they there|fore contriv'd to get a Law enacted which they knew he
<PB N="5" REF="005499_0004_1018409B4F8F71B8">
could not con&s;cientiou&s;ly comply with, in order to repre|&s;ent him as a Rebel for Neglect: But how wonderfully did the ble&s;&s;ed God overturn this Devi&s;e, and make it a mean of promoting the Ruin of its Contrivers: The Lord &s;ent his Angel and &s;hut the Lyons Mouths that they hurt not the Innocent, but they break the Bones of the Guil|ty. (<HI>Dan.</HI> vi.)</P>
<P>The Deliverance of <HI>England</HI> from the <HI>Gun-Powder</HI> Plot de&s;erves everla&s;ting Remembrance. As cruel <HI>Nero</HI> wi&s;h'd that the whole City of <HI>Rome</HI> had but one Neck that he might cut it off at a Stroke. So the bloody <HI>Papi&s;t's</HI> de|&s;igned to burn up at one dreadful Bla&s;t the Flowers and Strength of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, that &s;o the Bulwark of the Prote&s;tant Zion being de&s;troy'd, the whole might be|come an ea&s;y Prey to their Teeth: But how wonderful|ly was this Hell hatched &s;anguinary Scheme detected by a Letter &s;ent to one of the Nobles, who was a Member of Parliament, di&s;wading him from going to Parliament by this Argument, <HI>viz. That they &s;hould meet with a Blew and not &s;ee the Hand that gave it;</HI> which the King reading, apprehended that there was a De&s;ign to blow them up by <HI>Gun-Powder,</HI> and therefore wi&s;ely ordered the Cellars un|der and near the Parliament Hou&s;e to be &s;earched, upon which the mon&s;trous Traitor <HI>Faux,</HI> was found with the dark Lanthorn in his Hand, ready to kindle the dreadful burning Train. O amazing Mercy of God! O in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">andous Cruelty of <HI>Papi&s;ts!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. God hath wrought wonderful Deliverances for his Church and People in the following Manner.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. By &s;mall Means, thus the Stars in their Cour&s;es fought again&s;t <HI>Si&s;era;</HI> the Enemies of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> were &s;lain by Hail, and the <HI>Meabites</HI> with the Sun &s;hining on Water: And did not the Almighty break to Pieces the <HI>Spani&s;h Armado,</HI> which they vainly call'd <HI>Invincible,</HI> after all their proud
<PB N="6" REF="005499_0005_10184089DE7B63F8">
Boa&s;ts of bringing us into a State of Slavery. Was not <HI>Deborah,</HI> tho' of the weaker Sex, rai&s;ed up by the Almigh|ty for the Deliverance of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church and Nation from a State of Bondage? As King <HI>A&s;a</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erv'd, <HI>It is nothing to the Almighty to &s;ave by many or by few.</HI> As the Mariner Turns a great Ship by a &s;mall Helm, &s;o does the Almighty &s;ometimes perform great Works by in|con&s;iderable In&s;truments. How &s;urpri&s;ing, was the Victory which <HI>Gideon</HI> gain'd over the va&s;t Ho&s;t of <HI>Midian,</HI> by a few Hundreds of Men lighting of Lamps and breaking of Pitchers? Surely <HI>the Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong.</HI> He that girds on his Harne&s;s &s;hould not boa&s;t as he that puts it off! All Events are under the di|vine Controle.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Sometimes God delivers his Church and People without Means, and this is &s;till more amazing: Behold when there is no Interce&s;&s;or, then doth his right Arm bring Salva|tion! The very Night after <HI>Rab&s;hakeh's</HI> Bla&s;phemous Boa&s;ts, an Angel &s;lew one hundred and four&s;core and five Thou&s;and of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Army, (2 <HI>Kings</HI> xix. 35.) After <HI>Julian</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tate</HI> had made a Vow to &s;acrifice all the Chri&s;tians in the Empire upon his return from the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> War, it plea&s;ed God to give him a mortal Wound, which made him acknowledge that the <HI>Galilean</HI> had overcome him.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Sometimes God compa&s;&s;es the Deliverance and Benefit of his Church by contrary Means, <HI>out of the Eater comes forth Meat, and out of the Strong Sweetne&s;s,</HI> which is an amazing In&s;tance of his Almightine&s;s. Thus the <HI>I&s;|raelites</HI> Oppre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Egypt</HI> was a Mean of their Increa&s;e in it, and Deliverance from it, the more they were afflicted the more they grew. (<HI>Exo.</HI> i. 12) It is an old and a true Proverb, That <HI>the Blood of the Martyrs, is the Seed of the Church. Julian</HI> was well aware of this, and therefore he left off Per&s;ecuting the Church, not out of Mercy, but
<PB N="7" REF="005499_0006_1018409EE4C54CB0">
Envy, lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould be thereby increa&s;ed! But</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Almighty doth &s;ometimes re&s;train the Malice of Men again&s;t his Church, that it &s;hall not go that Length they would have it. <HI>P&s;.</HI> lxxvi. 10. <HI>Surely the Wrath of Man &s;hall prai&s;e thee, and the Remainder of Wrath &s;halt thou re&s;train.</HI> The Almighty bounds the Envy of Men and De|vils, as he does the proud Surges of the angry Ocean, <HI>thus far they may come and no farther.</HI> The Almighty put a Hook in the Jaws of <HI>Senacherib,</HI> and a Bridle in his Lips, &s;o that he was obliged to return by the Way he came a&s;hamed, after all the bla&s;phemous Boa&s;ts of his in&s;ulting Mini&s;ter <HI>Rab&s;hakeh,</HI> (2 <HI>King.</HI> xix.)</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Another Wonder of divine Mercy to the People of God is this, that the Almighty &s;ometimes &s;tills the Rage of Wicked Men again&s;t them, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> lxv. 7. <HI>Which &s;tilleth the Noi&s;e of the Seas, the Noi&s;e of their Waves, and the Tumult of the People.</HI> And hence it is &s;aid el&s;ewhere, that <HI>When a Man's Ways plea&s;e the Lord, he will make even his Enemies to be at Peace with him.</HI> Thus it was with <HI>Jacob,</HI> when <HI>E&s;au</HI> came forth with an angry Intention a|gain&s;t him, the Almighty &s;oon &s;mooth'd his &s;urly Brow, that in&s;tead of killing him, he ki&s;&s;ed him; and therefore we are told that Jacob <HI>&s;aw the Face of E&s;au as the Face of God. i. e.</HI> He &s;aw the gracious Hand of God in that &s;uddain Alteration in his Brothers A&s;pect.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The Almighty &s;ometimes repays into the Bo&s;oom of his Church's Enemies, the Evils they de&s;ign'd and en|deavour'd to do to her: Some In&s;tances of this Kind have been already given, to which let the&s;e be added, <HI>Pharoah</HI> thought to have de&s;troy'd <HI>I&s;rael</HI> by pur&s;uing them into the Red Sea, but in&s;tead of this, he and his Ho&s;t were drowned in the mighty Waters! <HI>Abithophel's</HI> Plot again&s;t <HI>David,</HI> prov'd his own ruin. The cruel Emperor <HI>Maximinus,</HI> who endeavour'd to de&s;troy the Chri&s;tians entirely, was con&s;um'd
<PB N="8" REF="005499_0007_1018408DC79A80B0">
with Lice. Time would fail to enumerate the particular Wonders of Mercy that have been &s;hew'd to the People of God, and that both as to Soul and Body.</P>
<P>What el&s;e is the Conver&s;ion of every Sinner to God, but a wonder of Mercy; and e&s;pecially of &s;uch as are of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Kind? Hereby Brands are pluck'd out of the Burning and made Monuments of pure and glorious Grace.</P>
<P>And is not the Pre&s;ervation of every one, or their Per&s;eve|rance in a State of Grace, a Wonder of divine Mercy! <Q>Grace in the Heart, &s;ays Bi&s;hop <HI>Hopkins,</HI> is like a Spark of Fire in the Ocean expos'd to the Violence of the Winds and Waves.</Q></P>
<P>Yea Wonders of divine Mercy have appear'd in the Pre|&s;ervation of the Lives of Gods People. Famous <HI>Du Moulin</HI> in the Time of the Ma&s;&s;acre at <HI>Paris,</HI> was pre&s;erv'd by a Spiders weaving her Web acro&s;s the Mouth of the Oven where he lay hid. And the Prote&s;tants who were be&s;ieg'd in <HI>Beziers</HI> in France, were deliver'd by a drunken Drummer, who going to his Quarters at Midnight rang the Alarm Bell. But I proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to &s;hew <HI>when God generally works Wonders of Mercy.</HI> And that is</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. When a Spirit of Prayer is given to the People of God <HI>P&s;al.</HI> cii. 13, 17. <HI>Thou &s;halt ari&s;e and have Mercy upon Zion, the &s;et Time to favour her is come</HI> (why) <HI>thy Servants favour the Du&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt regard the Prayer of the de&s;titute and not de&s;pi&s;e their Prayer.</HI> Before God confers Mercies, he gives a Spirit of Prayer to ask them, but when this is re|mov'd it is an awful Sign of approaching Judgments.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. When Gods People are brought low, and all hu|man Helps fail, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxxii. 36. <HI>The Lord &s;hall judge his People, and repent him&s;elf concerning his Servants, when he &s;eeth that their Power is gone, and that there is none &s;hut up
<PB N="9" REF="005499_0008_101840A1D36FEFD8">
or left, in the Mount of Extremity the Lord is &s;een;</HI> witne&s;s <HI>I&s;raels</HI> Deliverance out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and at the Red-Sea; after the Bricks were doubled <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> came for their Relief, and when <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were every way encompa&s;&s;ed at the Red-Sea, they &s;aw the Salvation of God!</P>
<P N="3">3dly. When God's Truth and Glory are much concern|ed, then he will exert his Almightine&s;s, lea&s;t his Name &s;hould be prophan'd, and his Honour in&s;ulted. <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvi. 22. <HI>Not for your &s;akes do I do this, but for my Holy Names Sake.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly, When a compleat Deliverance can be effected, an In&s;tance of this we have in the Story of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> they were &s;uffered to go into the great Deeps, that there they might be buried in a watry Grave!</P>
<P>Again another Time is when the Enemies of God's People breath forth the greate&s;t Rage again&s;t the Church of God. When <HI>Saul</HI> was going on in this Plight to <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> he was <HI>&s;truck down at once to the Ground.</HI></P>
<P>I may add that another Sea&s;on is, when God can get mo&s;t Honour upon his Enemies, and mo&s;t Honour from his Friends. Had <HI>Hamans</HI> Plot been cru&s;h'd in the Begin|ning of it, the Church would have been protected, but God's Glory would not have been &s;o much made manife&s;t. And therefore the Lord &s;uffers his Enemies to go on &s;ometimes a great Way, and bring their cruel Councils to ripene&s;s for Execution, before he bla&s;ts and breaks them!</P>
<P>And when the People of God are much di&s;tre&s;s'd before they get Deliverance, their Sen&s;e of the Mercy is heightned, and their Prai&s;es for it enlarg'd! The</P>
<P N="3">3d. General Head comes now to be di&s;cours'd upon, which was to &s;hew, <HI>Why God does &s;ometimes work Wonders of Mercy for his Church and People.</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. One Rea&s;on is, that not only tho&s;e to whom the Mercies are vouch&s;af'd may prai&s;e him; but al&s;o that the Generations
<PB N="10" REF="005499_0009_1018408F88BA40C0">
to come may tru&s;t in him and obey him. This was the happy I&s;&s;ue of <HI>I&s;raels</HI> Deliverance at the Red-Sea, <HI>They fear|ed and believed the Lord, Ex.</HI> xiv. 31. <HI>David</HI> improv'd his memorable Deliverance <HI>from the Jaws of the Lyon, and from the Paw of the Bear,</HI> to &s;trengthen his Expectation of future Mercies, and Deliverance from future Dangers; and the Apo&s;tle us'd the &s;ame Method, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 10. <HI>He hath de|livered us from &s;o great a Death, and doth deliver, in whom we tru&s;t that he will yet deliver us.</HI> And did not the Jewi&s;h Church tread in the &s;ame Path? <HI>P&s;.</HI> xxii 4, 5. <HI>Our Fa|thers tru&s;ted in thee, and thou did&s;t deliver them.</HI> And from this ble&s;&s;ed Topick &s;he el&s;ewhere pleads for Deliverance. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> li. 9, 10. <HI>Awake, awake, put on Strength, awake as in the Antient Days, art thou not he that wounded the Dragon, who dried up the Sea, and made the Deeps a Way for the ran&s;om|ed to pa&s;s over?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. To make his Glory illu&s;trious, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxxii. 27. <HI>I &s;aid I would &s;catter them into Corners and make the Remember|ance of them cea&s;e among Men, were it not that I feared the Wrath of the Enemy, le&s;t they &s;hould behave them&s;elves &s;trangely, and &s;ay our high Hand and not the Lord hath done all this.</HI> Thus vainly vaunted railing <HI>Rab&s;hakeh!</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> xviii. <HI>Where are the Gods of</HI> Sepharvaim, Hena, <HI>and</HI> Ivah, <HI>of</HI> Hamath <HI>and</HI> Arpad? <HI>Have they deliver'd</HI> Samaria <HI>out of my Hand, that the Lord &s;hould deliver</HI> Jeru&s;alem! This Argument <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> urg'd to prevent the threatn'd De&s;truction of <HI>I&s;rael. Num.</HI> xiv. <HI>If thou kill this People, the Nations will charge thee with Weakne&s;s.</HI> Jehovah doth great Things be|cau&s;e he is a great God, his Name and Nature are wonder|ful, and therefore his Works are &s;o! Every one does, or &s;hould do, Works &s;uited to their Quality and Character. <HI>Magnos magna decent.</HI> When <HI>Alexander</HI> met with a great Difficulty he thus encounter'd it, <HI>jam periculum par animo</HI> Alexandri. Here is Danger equal to <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Bravery.
<PB N="11" REF="005499_0010_101840A4C1B12AA0">
And wondrous Works do not only &s;uit a God, but make his Name glorious among the Nations, thus it was in re&s;pect of the Judgments inflicted upon <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Another Rea&s;on is the Relation that God bears to his People, together with the Promi&s;es he has made to pro|mote their Benefit and their Dependance on him. He is their Father and will he not have Compa&s;&s;ion on his Chil|dren; &s;urely Property excites Care, he has promi&s;ed to pro|tect them, <HI>And that no Weapon form'd again&s;t them &s;hall pro&s;|per. The Munition of Rocks &s;hall be their Defence, he that dwells in the Secret of the mo&s;t High, &s;hall be under the Sha|dow of the Almighty.</HI> He has promis'd to &s;upport them, and to make their Bread and Waters &s;ure. He has promi&s;ed to deliver them out of Trouble, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> l. 15. <HI>Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou &s;halt glorify me.</HI>&mdash;I&s;a. xliii. 3, 4. <HI>I gave</HI> Egypt <HI>for thy Ran&s;om,</HI> E|thiopia <HI>and</HI> Seba <HI>for thee, I have &s;av'd thee, therefore will I give Men for thee, and People for thy Life.</HI> Jehovah will ra|ther &s;ink many Nations in Ruins, than &s;uffer his poor Peo|ple to peri&s;h! Moreover they tru&s;t in God, and there|fore &s;hall not be confounded, for Tru&s;t engages Jehovah's Care. I proceed to the</P>
<P N="4">4th. Propos'd, which was to &s;how <HI>what Thankfullne&s;s for God's Mercies includes,</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It includes high and honourable Thoughts of them in our Minds,&mdash;frequent reflecting upon them, and grateful Sen&s;ations for them. &mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It includes our extolling God with our Lips, and giving him the whole Glory of his Works of Mercy, with|out &s;acrificing to our own Net, but on the contrary acknow|ledging our utter Unworthine&s;s of them in the lea&s;t Degree.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It includes our living the Prai&s;es of God, &amp; hoping in his Word, for future Mercies. The</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="12" REF="005499_0011_10184091489B6A38">5th. Propos'd comes next to be con&s;ider'd, which was to &s;hew, wherein appears the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of Thank&s;giving for every Mercy, and more e&s;pecially for &s;ignal In&s;tan|ces thereof? And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. There is &s;ome Di&s;po&s;ition deeply engraven in the Human Nature to expre&s;s Gratitude for Benefits receiv'd. <HI>Do not the</HI> Publicans <HI>&s;o,</HI> &s;aid our Lord? <HI>Lycurgus</HI> ob&s;erv'd, <HI>that it is a prodigious Thing not to repay a Benefit!</HI> Yea even &s;ome of the Brute Creation expre&s;s a kind of Gratitude, <HI>the Ox knoweth its Owner, and the A&s;s his Ma&s;ters Crib;</HI> and therefore we &s;hall be wor&s;e than Publicans, Pagans and Bea&s;ts if we neglect it!</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is mo&s;t ju&s;t and equal. He unju&s;tly asks a Bene|fit, who is not inclin'd to requite it. The lea&s;t Mercy de|&s;erves Acknowledgment, and how much more Wonders of Mercy. Seeing that our Being and all our Benefits are de|riv'd from God, it is but rea&s;onable that we &s;hould return a Tribute of Prai&s;e for them.</P>
