<HEAD>A Demon&s;tration of the great Duty, and U&s;efulne&s;s of PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is here attempted, is, a <HI>Demon&s;tration of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s, U&s;efulne&s;s, and great Duty of</HI> PRAYER, as including, not only a mo&s;t grateful Acknowledgement of all the In&s;tances of GOD's Goodne&s;s towards us, but al&s;o a humble and re&s;igned Addre&s;s to him for the Supply of our Wants, under a deep Sen&s;e of our intire Dependence upon him.</P>
<P>IN both the&s;e Sen&s;es I maintain, that Prayer is an indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty, founded in the Rea&s;on and Nature of Things; in the Nature of GOD and of Man, and the Relation, in which, by the Nece&s;&s;ity of our Na|ture, we &s;tand in to him. In order to be convinced of this, we need only con&s;ider fully, What we mean by the Word <HI>Duty?</HI>&mdash;What GOD is?&mdash;And what we are?&mdash;and the Nature of that Relation we &s;tand in to him. The&s;e I mu&s;t therefore define; and</P>
<P N="1">1. By the Word <HI>Duty,</HI> I mean, that Obligation we are immediately under from the inward Sen&s;e of our own Rea&s;on and Con&s;ciences, to con&s;ider and treat, or conduct, towards every Being, Per&s;on, and Thing, as being what in Truth it is, in order to our true Happine&s;s. But that which gives it the full Force of Obligation, and &s;o con&s;titutes the complete Notion of <HI>Duty,</HI> is, the Con&s;ideration of it, not only as being a Dictate of our own Rea&s;on and Con&s;ciences, ari&s;ing from our Conception of the Truth and Nature of Things; but moreover, and chiefly, as being the Will of God, our great Creator and moral Governor
<PB N="6" REF="008627_0005_10316786A9B50468">
concerning us, relating to what he requireth us to do or forbear, in order to our true Happine&s;s.&mdash;Now,</P>
<P N="2">2. By <HI>God,</HI> I mean, That great and glorious Being who is infinitely intelligent and active, infinitely wi&s;e and powerful, Holy, Ju&s;t, and Good, from whom we and all Things derive, and on whom we do in|tirely depend for every Moment we live, and every Breath we breathe, and all we enjoy and hope for, both in Time and to all Eternity; to whom we are accountable for all that we think, &s;peak, and do; and from who&s;e Goodne&s;s and Ju&s;tice, we have all Rea&s;on to expect we &s;hall be rewarded, or puni&s;hed, according as our Behaviour is good or bad, vertuous or vicious. Whether every one that pretends to think in earne&s;t, hath this Notion of GOD, I know not; but to me it evidently appears, from the Con|&s;ideration of Nature and Providence, that this is the Notion we ought to have of him. And I would wi&s;h any one that he&s;itates, exactly to read and con&s;ider Dr. CLARK<HI>'s Demon&s;tration of the Exi&s;tence and Attri|butes of GOD;</HI> and Mr. WALLASTON<HI>'s Religion of Nature;</HI> not to mention the Archbi&s;hop of CAMBRAY, and many others. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. By <HI>Man,</HI> I mean, what every one that duly con&s;iders, and truly knows him&s;elf, mu&s;t be intuitively &s;en&s;ible he really is; a meer dependent Being, that came into Being, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by the meer Will and Power of GOD, having no Sufficiency in him&s;elf to continue him&s;elf in Being, Life, or Health, &s;o much as one Moment, nor &s;o much as to think any Thing of him&s;elf, but all his Sufficiency is of GOD, both with regard to his Being, and Well-being. He is indeed furni&s;hed with intelligent and free, active, &s;elf exerting Powers; but at the &s;ame Time, (as he is in Fact now) he is a very frail and &s;ickly, a very weak and mortal Creature, and which is wor&s;e, he is a very &s;inful and untoward Creature, and is daily
<PB N="7" REF="008627_0006_1031678A89C27190">
violating the inward Sen&s;e of his own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, and acting contrary to the moral Per|fections, and con&s;equently the Will of his Maker, Pre|&s;erver, and Governor.&mdash;And yet, from the divine Attributes, compared with his pre&s;ent State, and the Powers and Faculties he is endowed with, from whence the true End of his Being mu&s;t be judged of, there &s;eems all imaginable Rea&s;on to conclude, that this Life is not his All, but that he is now only in a State of Probation for another State after this Life; that, as to his better Part, he is really an immortal Being, and accountable for his Behaviour here.&mdash;Now therefore,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. THE Relation we &s;tand in to God, is evi|dently that of Creatures to their Creator; that of mere Dependents to their Benefactor; that of Subjects to their King and Governor; and moreover, that of Sinners and Criminals with regard to their Judge; and unable, without his In&s;truction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to qua|lify them&s;elves for, or to regain, his Favour.&mdash;If then it be our Duty, con&s;idering our&s;elves as being what we are, to conduct our&s;elves towards God as being what he is, it demon&s;tratively follows,</P>
<P N="5">5thly. THAT it mu&s;t be our Duty, not only as Creatures, Children, Dependents, and Subjects, to give all po&s;&s;ible Expre&s;&s;ion and Proof of our Love, Gratitude, and Obedience to God, as our Creator and Father, and our great Benefactor and Supreme King and Governor; but moreover, as we are frail Crea|tures, and liable to innumerable Ca&s;ualties and Cala|mities, and depend on him every Moment for our Pre|&s;ervation and Well-being, it mu&s;t be evidently fit, right, and our bounden Duty, every Day to implore his Protection and Ble&s;&s;ing, and humbly addre&s;s our &s;elves to him for the Supply of our Wants.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, as we are Sinners, and have in fact, in innumerable In&s;tances, violated our Duty to him as
<PB N="8" REF="008627_0007_1031678C11A53E10">
our King and our Judge, to whom we are account|able for our Behaviour; and at the &s;ame Time, if we do at all know our &s;elves, we mu&s;t be con&s;cious, not only of our Guilt, but al&s;o of our great Weakne&s;s, and of the little Command we have of our Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially (as the Ca&s;e generally is) if we have contracted any vicious Habits, which are ex|tremely difficult to conquer; I &s;ay, the Fact being thus, it mu&s;t be no le&s;s evidently fit, right, and our bounden Duty, mo&s;t humbly to confe&s;s and bewail our Sins, and beg God's Pardon for what&s;oever we have done ami&s;s, and to implore his Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance to ena|ble us to conduct better for the future, and to bear with Patience what&s;oever he calls us to &s;uffer in the Cour&s;e of his Providence, and to do with Chearfulne&s;s and Fidelity what he requires of us, in order to an&s;wer the End of our Being, which is our true Perfection and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus it appears to me, that this Duty of Prayer, is demon&s;tratively e&s;tabli&s;hed from the Rea&s;on and Na|ture of Things; and this Rea&s;oning is confirmed to be Right from Fact and Experience corre&s;pondent to it, it being always found, that, by &s;uch a con&s;tant Cour&s;e of Prayer, joined with Vigilance, and a due Care of their Conduct, good Men have been enabled to gain and maintain a good Ma&s;tery of their vicious Tempers and Habits, and to make Proficiency in every Virtue, agreeable to an ancient Maxim or Ob&s;ervation, "That as per&s;i&s;ting in a Cour&s;e of &s;inning will make a Man leave praying, &s;o a &s;tedfa&s;t Per&s;everance in a Cour&s;e of Prayer, will eventually make a Man leave &s;inning, and return to his Duty."</P>
<P>Now again&s;t all this, it hath been objected by &s;ome, who I doubt do not rightly know God, or them&s;elves, "That it reflects hard on the Wi&s;dom, Benevolence, and Ju&s;tice of God, to &s;uppo&s;e, that he hath not given Mankind &s;ufficient Capacities to di&s;tingui&s;h Right from
<PB N="9" REF="008627_0008_1031678E8523A4B0">
Wrong, Virtue from Vice, <HI>&amp;c</HI> and &s;ufficient Abili|ties to an&s;wer the End of their Being: And if he hath done this, Prayer mu&s;t be a u&s;ele&s;s Ceremony." This is illu&s;trated, by comparing Man to a Machine, which if it is not &s;o made as to an&s;wer it's End without a con|tinual Interpo&s;ition, it mu&s;t give but a poor Notion of the Wi&s;dom or Power of its Author, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer:&mdash;If Man were indeed but a Ma|chine, this Rea&s;oning would be right enough, even him &s;uppo&s;ing a con&s;cious Machine. But it can be nothing to the Purpo&s;e if he be, as in fact he is, not only an intelligent, but al&s;o a free, active, &s;elf-exert|ing Creature, and therefore of a Nature to be led to an&s;wer the End of his Being, not by Mechani&s;m, but in the Way of moral Government, being de&s;igned to be influenced by Con&s;iderations and Motives &s;ugge&s;ted to his Under&s;tanding, under the Sen&s;e of which he is freely to exert his own Activity, in order to an&s;wer the End of his Being.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e, he may be (as in fact, I allow he is) endowed with &s;ufficient Powers, Faculties, and Means to an&s;wer the End of his Being, &s;o that it &s;hall be his own Fault if he does not; and yet, as he is a free Agent, it mu&s;t be in his Power to abu&s;e his Liberty, and other Faculties, &s;o as to fall &s;hort of it, without the Divine Interpo&s;ition. But this, from the Nature of moral Government, he may always be &s;ecure of, if he will in earne&s;t apply him&s;elf to God by Prayer, and dili|gently make u&s;e of the Means which he hath put within his Power, and pointed out to him.</P>
<P>But for the full clearing up of this Objection, and the further Demon&s;tration of the Duty of Prayer, I will next proceed, and go upon the Principle the Ob|jector allows, <HI>viz.</HI> "That the Duty of any Creature mu&s;t be determined, (or judged of) by the End for which it was created."&mdash;Let us then con&s;ider, what mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the End for which Man was
<PB N="10" REF="008627_0009_1031679112A96F70">
created? And as to this, no doubt but it mu&s;t be al|lowed, that the End for which it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed an infinitely wi&s;e and good God brought Man into Being, was, that he might do Honour to his Maker, and enjoy him&s;elf, and be, in &s;ome good Degree, happy in the Participation and Enjoyment of his Good|ne&s;s. And he that willed this End, mu&s;t have willed the Means nece&s;&s;ary to it. Con&s;equently it is allowed, that Man is furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient Powers, Abilities, and Means for his true Happine&s;s. He is an intelli|gent Creature, and con&s;equently capable of knowing wherein his true Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, and the Means of attaining it. And he is a free, active, &s;elf-exerting Creature, and therefore is capable of an active Appli|cation of him&s;elf to the Pur&s;uit of his Happine&s;s, in the U&s;e of the Means conducive to it. But then, he is of him&s;elf an ignorant Creature, and therefore needs to be in&s;tructed both in the End and Means; and he is a weak dependent Being, and therefore needs to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, as well as in&s;tructed; for both which he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily depend upon God.</P>
<P>And indeed I am apt to think, that if the Nature of a Creature, as &s;uch, be duly con&s;idered, it will be found that no Creature is, or ever was, or can be made &s;elf-&s;ufficient to its own Happine&s;s; nor is it fit it &s;hould, if it were po&s;&s;ible. On the Contrary, as every Crea|ture is in it &s;elf, a meer dependent Being, it is mo&s;t fit that every con&s;cious, intelligent Creature, &s;hould ha|bitually live under a deep Sen&s;e of it's Dependence, as a nece&s;&s;ary Means to it's true Happine&s;s, and account it its greate&s;t Glory, it's true Perfection, and highe&s;t Satisfaction, to hold a perpetual Intercour&s;e with the great Parent Mind, the eternal Father of Spirits, in and by whom it lives and moves, and hath it's Being; and in doing this, to make it it's own intelligent free Act, and Deed to exert and expre&s;s it's Sen&s;e of it's De|pendence, and its earne&s;t A&s;pirations alter, and Strug|gles
<PB N="11" REF="008627_0010_10316793C5328548">
towards an intire free active Union of it's Will with the Will of it's great and Almighty Parent, in Con|formity to the moral Perfections of his Nature, where|in it's highe&s;t Perfection and Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts. And this, in Effect, is all that is implied in Prayer, which therefore mu&s;t in the Nature of the Thing, be a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Means towards an&s;wering the End of our Being. Now therefore let us lay the&s;e Propo&s;itions together.</P>
<P N="1">1. The End of our Being is our true and endle&s;s Happine&s;s. I &s;ay <HI>endle&s;s,</HI> becau&s;e it is plain we can|not be truly Happy, without having a Pro&s;pect of being endle&s;sly &s;o; and it is no le&s;s plain that we can|not attain to the intire End of our Being, &s;o as to be truly Happy, in this very mixed imperfect State; our Exi&s;tence therefore mu&s;t reach forward and extend to an endle&s;s State of further Proficiency after this Life.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be Happy; nay im|po&s;&s;ible in the Nature of the Thing, but that we mu&s;t be mi&s;erable under the Power and Guilt of Sin, or in a Cour&s;e of Deviation from moral Rectitude, both from the mi&s;cheivous Nature of Sin in it &s;elf, and from the inward Reproaches of our own Rea&s;on and Con&s;ciences, as well as the Di&s;plea&s;ure of our Maker. On the Contrary,</P>
<P N="3">3. Our true Happine&s;s, as free, intelligent and ac|tive Beings, or moral Agents, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the va&s;t Sati&s;faction ari&s;ing from the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our &s;in|cere and faithful Practice of, and Proficiency in, all moral Virtues, and a Sen&s;e of the Divine Favour and Approbation, which will not fail to attend it.</P>
<P N="4">4. Our Practice and Proficiency in all moral Vir|tues, implies, our Conformity to the moral Perfections of God, the Author of our Being, and on whom we depend; at lea&s;t, our con&s;tant Care and Endeavour, as far as we are able, to be <HI>Holy as He is Holy, Pure as He is Pure, Righteous as He is Righteous,</HI> true and faithful, kind and merciful, as He is: All which are,
<PB N="12" REF="008627_0011_1031679698B45358">
in the Nature of them, conducive and nece&s;&s;ary to our Happine&s;s, and therefore mu&s;t be his Will and Law concerning us, becau&s;e he would have us happy. Now,</P>
<P N="5">5thly, and la&s;tly, The natural and nece&s;&s;ary Means, in the Nature of Things, towards the&s;e Attainments, is to have Recour&s;e to GOD, and conver&s;e frequently with that great Pattern of all moral Perfection; la|menting our many and great Deficiencies, in falling &s;hort of the&s;e Things, and our great Untowardne&s;s in acting &s;o much the Rever&s;e of them, &s;o contrary to his ble&s;&s;ed Will; imploring his Pardon and Mercy for our pa&s;t Mi&s;carriages, and expre&s;&s;ing our earne&s;t A&s;pi|rations after Amendment, and better Proficiency for the future; and finally, from a due Sen&s;e of the great Weakne&s;s of our Rea&s;on and Re&s;olution, and the Strength of our Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions, and ill Habits, and the many Temptations that &s;urround us, earne&s;tly &s;oliciting the &s;ecret Influences and A&s;&s;i&s;tances of that great Parent Spirit on whom we depend, to enable us to gain and maintain the Ma&s;tery of our &s;elves, and to make all po&s;&s;ible Proficiency in all tho&s;e Virtues and moral Attainments, wherein our true Perfection and Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e are the proper Exerci&s;es of Prayer! and &s;ure I am, He cannot &s;ee either deep or far into the pre&s;ent Condition of human Nature, who is not fully &s;en&s;ible that &s;uch a Practice is evidently, in the Nature of Things, conducive and nece&s;&s;ary to all moral Proficiency; and con&s;equently, that it is &s;o far from being "a u&s;ele&s;s Ceremony," that it is of the greate&s;t U&s;e, and therefore an indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty, as being a nece&s;&s;ary Means towards an&s;wering the End of our Being.</P>
<P>If, indeed, our Objector is fully &s;ure and con&s;cious to him&s;elf, that he never has, nor ever does, in the lea&s;t vary, in Thought, Word, or Deed, from the great Rules of Virtue, and moral Rectitude, it will
<PB N="13" REF="008627_0012_103167982738D138">
be allowed that he has no Occa&s;ion to a&s;k GOD's Par|don; and if he perfectly knows that he has always in him&s;elf that Strength and Pre&s;ence of Mind, as to have and maintain an intire Ma&s;tery of his Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;|&s;ions, and that he can &s;teadily with&s;tand all Temptati|ons, and that by dint of his own Strength, he always actually does his whole Duty, all that is Right and Good, both towards GOD and Man, I own he has no Occa&s;ion to a&s;k GOD's Help, but has infinite Re|&s;on to be thankful, and this is all he has to do.&mdash;But I very much que&s;tion, whether he can or will venture to &s;ay all this: Nay I que&s;tion, whether this la&s;t was ever the Ca&s;e of any Creature, no not even of the highe&s;t Angel in Heaven, without a divine Influence, much le&s;s of &s;uch a frail Creature as Man evidently is.&mdash;</P>
<P>For my own Part, I mu&s;t be free to confe&s;s, that it is far from being the Ca&s;e with me, and I believe there are very few con&s;iderate Per&s;ons but &s;uch as will rea|dily join with me. I am con&s;cious that I am &s;o un|toward and deficient, and &s;o weak and infirm, that I need to a&s;k God's Pardon and Mercy, and his Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance every Day that I live; and this I find to be the only Cour&s;e I can take, in Conjunction with due Care and Vigilence, to get the better of my Infir|mities, and to make any tolerable Proficiency in Vir|tue. And it is to me the greate&s;t Satisfaction in the World, to hold &s;uch a frequent Intercour&s;e with the great Father of my Spirit, and thereby to impre&s;s my Mind with a due Sen&s;e of his perpetual Pre&s;ence with me, and In&s;pection over me, and in View thereof, to commit my&s;elf to his Protection, Guidance and Ble&s;|&s;ing in all my Ways.</P>
<P>This Sen&s;e of God's univer&s;al Pre&s;ence and All-&s;ee|ing Eye, which is va&s;tly improved and cultivated by the daily Exerci&s;e of Prayer, is of the utmo&s;t Impor|tance to make us watchful and circum&s;pect in all our Behaviour before him, nay, in the Tempers of our

Hearts, as well as the Conduct of our Lives; and the more &s;o, as it hath moreover the greate&s;t Tendencey to make and keep us humble, for, Humility is the Ba&s;is of all other Virtues, as on the other Hand, Pride, Self-Conceit, and Self-&s;ufficiency, are Tempers ex|tremely mi&s;becoming a meer dependent, weak, and &s;in|ful Being, and utter Enemies to all Proficiency in Knowledge, or Virtue. It is therefore very fit that our Creator &s;hould keep us in a perpetual State of Depen|dence, and that we &s;hould, by the frequent Practice of Prayer, keep up and cultivate in our Minds, a mo&s;t humble Sen&s;e of our Weakne&s;s, Dependence and Un|towardne&s;s, as a nece&s;&s;ary Means in order to our A|mendment and Proficiency in Virtue and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Since therefore it is thus manife&s;t, that Prayer is in the Nature of the Thing, &s;uch an effectual Means to promote our Proficiency in all moral Virtue, in order to our true Happine&s;s, which is the End of our Being, it is evident, That ina&s;much as God wills this End, he mu&s;t mo&s;t certainly al&s;o will this Means, and con&s;e|quently, that it mu&s;t be his Will and Law concerning us, that we &s;hould live in the daily Performance of this Duty. It mu&s;t therefore be a direct Rebellion again&s;t him, and the Con&s;titution which he hath made, to live in the Neglect of it.</P>
<P>And &s;ince we are placed in Society, and have com|mon Sins to confe&s;s and reform, and common Wants, both Temporal and Spiritual, that we mu&s;t depend up|on God, the common Father and Lord of all, for the Supply of, and ina&s;much as every thing that Concerns our common Weal, is be&s;t promoted by &s;ocial Combi|nations, it is evident that a common &s;ocial and public Wor&s;hip, in Prayer as well as Prai&s;e, mu&s;t be our in|di&s;pen&s;ible Duty, as well as Per&s;onal: E&s;pecially, if we moreover con&s;ider, that &s;uch a common &s;ocial Wor|&s;hip in jointly paying our common Duty, to our common heavenly Father, Lord, and Governor, is

mo&s;t amiable in it&s;elf, and hath, in the Nature of the Thing, a direct Tendency to promote univer&s;al Bene|volence, Brotherly Love, the Love of public Weal, and all &s;ocial Virtues towards one another, as well as Piety towards God. So that, in order to any one's be|ing a true Patriot or Friend to the public Weal of Mankind, and his Country, it is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;|&s;ary that he &s;hould &s;et a good Example of a frequent and religious Attendance on the public Wor&s;hip: Nay he mu&s;t be an Enemy to Mankind if he does not.&mdash;And it is a Thing of mo&s;t melancholly Con&s;ideration in this degenerate Age, that &s;ince Prayer, both per&s;onal and &s;ocial, hath been &s;o much decryed and de&s;pi&s;ed, and the public Wor&s;hip, as well as private, &s;o much neglected, and e&s;pecially by many great Examples in our Nation, there hath been a va&s;t Increa&s;e of all Sorts of Immo|ralities, and &s;uch a Deluge of Vice prevailing, as threatens the utter Ruin both of our Nation and its Colonies.</P>
<P>But to proceed. It is further objected again&s;t this great Duty of Prayer, That, in the Nature of the Thing, Prayer can attain no End, and therefore mu&s;t be impertinent, becau&s;e there is a certain e&s;tabli&s;hed Cour&s;e of Providence, which cannot be altered with|out a Miracle, which we have no right to expect or de&s;ire.&mdash;To this I an&s;wer,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. A Miracle implies a very &s;en&s;ible and manife&s;t Variation from the known e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws of Nature, whereas, he that hath &s;tudied Nature, can ea&s;ily con|ceive of a thou&s;and Ca&s;es wherein God may &s;ecretly interpo&s;e to prevent, or bring about various Events in the Cour&s;e of Providence, without any &s;en&s;ible Varia|tion from the general known e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws of Na|ture; as, in varying the Cour&s;e of Winds and Weather, preventing or healing Sickne&s;&s;es, and the like.&mdash; Nor can it rea&s;onably be denied, or doubted, but God can &s;ecretly influence the Thoughts, Purpo&s;es and Re|&s;olutions

But,</P>
<P N="2">2. I would further ob&s;erve, that as this Objection proceeds upon the Suppo&s;ition of only a general Pro|vidence, or a Kind of Fate, and implies in it the Denial of any particular providential free Interpo&s;ition, in Be|half of either particular Nations or Individuals, it be|trays a very low, and mo&s;t unworthy Conception of the infinite Being; for it imports as tho' he either can|not or will not, <HI>&s;o</HI> conduct the general Cour&s;e of his Providence, as at the &s;ame Time to attend to, pro|vide for, and influence the Affairs of particular Nati|ons, and Communities of Men (as is fit upon &s;ome &s;pecial Emergencies, either for Correction, or Retri|bution) and even of every individual Per&s;on, in Pro|portion

to their &s;everal bad or good moral Qualifica|tions. Whereas it is certain, that his infinite Wi&s;dom and Power mu&s;t enable him, and his infinite Benevo|lence and Ju&s;tice mu&s;t, in all Rea&s;on, be conceived to di&s;po&s;e him at once, equally to give Attention to what concerns the whole of Things, and at the &s;ame Time to what relates to the Ca&s;e of every Individual.</P>
<P>But la&s;tly, &s;uppo&s;ing Prayer &s;hould not procure any Alteration in the Cour&s;e of Providence, (as for wi&s;e and good Rea&s;ons, in many In&s;tances the Ca&s;e may be) it doth not follow but that &s;everal excellent Ends may be accompli&s;hed by it, particularly, as it cultivates and improves in our Minds a great Sen&s;e of God and our Dependence upon him, and di&s;ciplines us to the Exerci&s;e of an implicit Faith in him, and a humble Re&s;ignation to his all di&s;po&s;ing Will, and a greater Concern to plea&s;e him in all our moral Con|duct, that we may be the better qualified for future Favours. But for further Satisfaction on this Head, I would wi&s;h the Objector to read and con&s;ider well what Mr. <HI>Wolla&s;ton</HI> an&s;wers to this Objection.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, it is objected, "That Prayer implies a low and unworthy Notion of the Deity, either as not knowing or not willing what is be&s;t for us of him|&s;elf: Whereas it is impo&s;&s;ible but that God mu&s;t know what we Want infinitely better than we do our|&s;elves, and mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed to do what is fit and be&s;t for us, without any Information or Importunity of ours."</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer.&mdash; It is very true, God knows what we want, and is di&s;po&s;ed to do what is be&s;t for us; but as we are rea&s;onable, free, &s;elf-exerting Crea|tures, and our true Perfection and Happine&s;s is, in the Nature of it, to be accompli&s;hed by our own Ac|tivity, under the Influence of the divine Aid, in the U&s;e of proper Means, it is not fit that he &s;hould pro&s;|titute his Favours upon us, without our own Activity
<PB N="18" REF="008627_0017_103167A3C692BD40">
in endeavouring to qualify our&s;elves for them. Since then, Prayer, as I have &s;hewn, hath a direct and natural Tendency to promote and improve in us all tho&s;e moral Qualifications that render it fit he &s;hould be&s;tow his Favours upon us, it is therefore fit in it&s;elf, and mu&s;t accordingly be his Will, that we &s;hould u&s;e this Exerci&s;e as a Means for our Proficiency, and as a Condition of his Be&s;towments; Ju&s;t as it is fit that a kind Parent who knows what is be&s;t for his Child, and is &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to be&s;tow it, &s;hould yet require him in a dutiful Manner to a&s;k it as a Favour, as being a proper Means to cultivate and improve in him all tho&s;e dutiful and filial Tempers, and that de|cent and obedient Behaviour which, as it contri|butes to his own Happine&s;s, does at the &s;ame Time qualify him to receive his Parent's Favours.</P>
<P>It is therefore an utterly wrong Notion of Prayer, to imagine that the Intent of it is to inform God of what he is ignorant of, or incline him to do what is be&s;t for us, as tho' he were not otherwi&s;e &s;o di&s;po&s;ed. No: The Intent of it is, to keep up in our Minds a lively and habitual Sence of our Dependence, and to qualify us to receive the Ble&s;&s;ings we pray for, by cul|tivating and improving in our Souls, all tho&s;e dutiful Tempers and Di&s;po&s;itions of Faith, Hope, Tru&s;t in Him, and Submi&s;&s;ion to Him, and a Concern above all Things, to conform our&s;elves to his Will, and the moral Perfections of his Nature, wherein our real Per|fection and Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts; and which are, in the Nature of the Things them&s;elves, Qualifications ne|ce&s;&s;ary to fit us to receive the Favours we a&s;k for, and without which we &s;hould never an&s;wer the End of our Being.</P>
<P>Thus I think I have an&s;wered, or obviated every Objection that hath been offered again&s;t the Duty of Prayer&punc; arguing only from the Rea&s;on and Nature of Things, to which I was confined by the Argumenta|tions
<PB N="19" REF="008627_0018_103167A65C60C540">
of the Objector, who, by one Expre&s;&s;ion he has, &s;eems to think we have no other Way of coming to the Knowledge of our Duty but by Rea&s;oning.&mdash; But, alas! What a very little would Mankind ever have known about the Rea&s;on and Nature of Things, e&s;pe|cially Divine Things, without Divine In&s;truction?&mdash; When indeed, we are in&s;tructed in the fir&s;t Rudiments of the Knowledge of God and our&s;elves, and our Rela|tion and Duty to Him and one another, the Connecti|ons that obtain in the Nature of Things between tho&s;e Truths and Duties, will, to a thinking Per&s;on, be de|mon&s;tratively obvious; as <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>Wi&s;dom is ea&s;y to him that under&s;tandeth,</HI> i. e. having learned it by teaching.&mdash;And this, I apprehend, is the Rea&s;on that we have now &s;o many fine Demon&s;trations of Re|ligion and Morality, which have &s;o blown us up with a Conceit of the Sufficiency of our own Rea&s;on, that we are apt to imagine we could have di&s;covered all the&s;e Truths and Duties of our&s;elves without any Di|vine teaching; whereas the Truth is, without having fir&s;t had the <HI>Data</HI> in Scripture given us, we &s;hould &s;carce ever have had a Thought of them, much le&s;s been able to demon&s;trate them by the Dint of our weak Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>What a mi&s;erable Hand, Mankind would have made of Rea&s;oning from the Nature of Things, with|out Divine Teaching or Revelation, is abundantly evi|dent from Fact, to whoever looks into the real State of tho&s;e Millions of People, where the Ancient Original In&s;tructions have in a great Mea&s;ure, been gradually lo&s;t, and for Want of which they are, in Fact, &s;unk into &s;uch an abject Condition of Ignorance and De|pravity, as is hardly to be conceived by us, who have had the ine&s;timable Advantage of Divine Teaching.&mdash; It is true, there were &s;ome extraordinary Men in the Heathen World, that did attain to the Knowledge of many &s;ublime Truths and Duties: But from Facts
<PB N="20" REF="008627_0019_103167ABECCDE110">
which there is no di&s;puting, there is the greate&s;t Rea|&s;on to conclude that they would &s;carce ever have thought of them, if it had not been for &s;ome Remains of the Original divine In&s;tructions handed down to them from the Beginning, by Tradition. For it is to Tradition that they frequently a&s;cribe their be&s;t Noti|ons, which they picked up in their Travels, far and wide among the Wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t Ancient Nations the <HI>Chaldeans, Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Phenicins,</HI> who&s;e Notions were &s;till &s;o much the better by how much the older, and the nearer they approached to the Fountain Head, and by how much the nearer Connections they had with that Nation, among whom tho&s;e Original divine In|&s;tructions were handed down by Writing, together with the ancient &s;acred Heiroglyphics. See <HI>Shuckford</HI>'s Connection, and <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI>'s Works.</P>
<P>We have in particular &s;ome fine Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Plato, Tully, Seneca,</HI> and others, relating to the Subjects be|fore us, our Dependence on the divine Aids, and the Duty of Prayer. <HI>Plato</HI> in <HI>Menone</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>Virtue does not derive from Nature, nor Teaching, but from a divine Influence.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Tully</HI> in <HI>Nat. Deor.</HI> &s;ays, <Q>We mu&s;t believe that no Good Man was ever &s;uch, but by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, and that no one was ever a great Man without a divine In&s;piration or In|fluence.&mdash; And <HI>Seneca,</HI> Ep. 41. &s;ays, No one is a good Man without God, and that there is no good Mind or Di&s;po&s;ition without him. Ep. 71.</Q>&mdash;And <Q>accordingly he directs with regard to Prayer, Ep. 10. That we &s;hould fir&s;t beg of God a good Un|der&s;tanding, and good Health of the Soul, and then that of the Body.</Q>&mdash; <HI>Plato</HI> wrote an excellent Dialogue, his 2d <HI>Alcihiades,</HI> meerly upon the Subject of Prayer, wherein he introduces <HI>Socrates</HI> (who was the Oracle of Wi&s;dom in tho&s;e Days) as highly commend|ing that Prayer of an ancient Poet, <Q>That God would give us tho&s;e Things that are really good for
<PB N="21" REF="008627_0020_103167AD820355C8">
us, whether we a&s;k them or not; and that he would by no means grant us tho&s;e Things that are bad for us, however &s;o earne&s;tly we &s;hould de&s;ire them.</Q>&mdash; In &s;hort it doth not appear that any of the wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t Men, even in the Heathen World (none but a few Athei&s;ts) ever doubted but that Prayer is an indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty: All their Difficulty was to know what they ought to pray for, and how they &s;hould pray acceptably. Here indeed <HI>Socrates</HI> laments the Darkne&s;s they were under, and judges it a Thing of &s;o much Importance, that he is per&s;waded God will &s;end &s;ome great Per&s;on to in&s;truct Mankind how to per|form this Duty.</P>
<P>Now I would a&s;k our Objector; Did the&s;e great Men di&s;cover the&s;e Things by their own rea&s;oning and the meer Light of Nature?&mdash; If &s;o, it is plain that Prayer mu&s;t be a Duty not only evidently founded in Nature, but di&s;coverable by meer Rea&s;on, and con|&s;equently be a mo&s;t rea&s;onable Duty, &s;o that it mu&s;t be flying in the Face of Rea&s;on to doubt of it, or ne|glect it.&mdash;On the other Hand, if, (as I rather think) they had the&s;e Things by Tradition derived down ori|ginally from divine In&s;truction, (tho' when taught they appeared intirely agreeable to Rea&s;on) this proves that &s;uch an original divine In&s;truction and Injunction there was; and if &s;o, it mu&s;t be a direct Rebellion again&s;t Heaven, as well as Rea&s;on, to he&s;itate about it, and not live in the due Performance of it.</P>
<P>Whatever therefore &s;ome Men may think, it yet remains a mo&s;t certain Truth, that God hath from the Beginning, and thro' all Ages &s;ince, at &s;undry Times and in divers Manners, in&s;tructed Mankind in the&s;e Affairs, and expre&s;sly declared his Will and our Duty relating to them. It is indeed a Thing of mo&s;t melancholly Con&s;ideration, that this &s;hould become a Matter of doubt, as it is, with many in this degenerate Age, which, as it has &s;adly for&s;aken God, &s;eems to

be abandoned by him!&mdash; Nay, &s;ome have peremptorily concluded again&s;t it, while others mo&s;t ungratefully make a meer Joke of it, and treat it with the utmo&s;t Contempt.&mdash;However, I can't but earne&s;tly wi&s;h that Gentlemen would once again &s;eriou&s;ly return to the Con&s;ideration of this Matter, and be per&s;waded to think it, at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible, that they may be mi&s;led:&mdash; That it is a mo&s;t fatal Thing for them, if they be:&mdash; And that it is, therefore, infinitely worth the While for them, again to enquire with Candor, and without Pre|judice or Partiality, into this important Affair.&mdash; Parti|cularly I would wi&s;h them to read and con&s;ider with the utmo&s;t Exactne&s;s, &s;ome Things that have been written of late Years, and particularly Bi&s;hop <HI>Butler</HI>'s Analogy, Bi&s;hop <HI>Berkeley</HI>'s Minute Philo&s;opher, and Pre&s;ident <HI>Forbes</HI>'s Works, Doctor <HI>Ellis</HI> of the Know|ledge of Divine Things, and a late Peice called <HI>Dei&s;m revealed,</HI> and <HI>Clayton,</HI> &amp;c. again&s;t <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> not to mention <HI>We&s;t, Leland,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland</HI> has lately, by the Piety and Charity of the good young <HI>Prince of Wales,</HI> been &s;ent in great Numbers into <HI>America,</HI> to prevent our Apo&s;tacy.</NOTE> <HI>Browne,</HI> and &s;everal others, all which have written long &s;ince it &s;eems by many to have been, incon&s;iderately taken for granted, that all Pretences to reveal'd Religion are meer Impo&s;tures.</P>
<P>And before I take my Leave of this Subject, I will venture to offer a &s;hort Sketch of Argumentation <HI>a priori,</HI> from the Divine Attributes, and the Nature of Things, to prove, that there mu&s;t have been, and con&s;equently that in Fact there mo&s;t certainly was, from the Beginning, a Divine Revelation or In&s;truc|tion given to Mankind.

<P N="1">1. I pre&s;ume I may take it for granted, That Man|kind were at fir&s;t brought into Being by an infinitely Wi&s;e and Good God.</P>
<P N="2">2. They mu&s;t therefore have been made for a wi&s;e and good End.&mdash; Now, as I have ob&s;erved above,</P>
<P N="3">3. This End mu&s;t have been, that they might be Happy, or in &s;ome good Degree enjoy them&s;elves. And,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="23" REF="008627_0022_103167B1E8B52C50">4. It is a maxim of eternal Truth, That he that wills an End, if he be Wi&s;e and Good, mu&s;t, of Cour&s;e, will the Means nece&s;&s;ary for the Accompli&s;h|ment of that End. Now,</P>
<P N="5">5. Look into the Nature of Man, and con&s;ider what mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary Means of his Well-being, and you will find, he mu&s;t as a &s;ocial Creature have &s;ome Language, and as an Animal he mu&s;t know what is proper Food and other Means for his Sub&s;i&s;tance, and con&s;equently know &s;omething of the Nature of the Things about him.&mdash;Nor can he be Happy without knowing from thence &s;omething of the Author of Na|ture, his Maker, and Benefactor, his Pre&s;erver, and Governor, who mu&s;t be his Chief Good, and con&s;e|quently, how to conduct him&s;elf &s;o as to be &s;ecure of his Favour in Conformity to all tho&s;e moral Laws, which, both with regard to his Maker, him&s;elf, and his Species, are in the Nature of Things, nece&s;&s;ary to his Happine&s;s: Nor mu&s;t he be ignorant of their Sancti|ons, the Happine&s;s that will attend his Obedience to them, and the Mi&s;ery that mu&s;t re&s;ult from his Di&s;|obedience.&mdash; But,</P>
<P N="6">6. However &s;o nece&s;&s;ary the&s;e Things and the Knowledge of them are, as Means to Man's Well-being and Happine&s;s, and however &s;o perfect you may &s;up|po&s;e his Powers and Faculties to have been, it is plain that when he fir&s;t came into Being he mu&s;t have been totally ignorant of them.&mdash; Now</P>
<P N="7">7. It cannot, I think, be doubted, but that it was po&s;&s;ible for God Almighty, either by him&s;elf or &s;ome other Agent, to appear to the fir&s;t of our Species, and conver&s;e with them, and in&s;truct them in the Know|ledge of all the&s;e Things, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their Well-being.</P>
<P N="8">8. If therefore our Maker infinitely wi&s;e and good, de&s;igned our Well-being and Happine&s;s as his End, it is Demon&s;tration that he mu&s;t have immediately ap|peared,

<P>Can it then be imagined, That the infinitely wi&s;e and good Father of Mankind, would bring them into Being and then de&s;ert them?&mdash;Would he leave them to grope out the Means of their Well-being them&s;elves, in pur&s;uit of which they could not fail, without In|&s;truction, of making 10,000 fatal Blunders?&mdash;At be&s;t, if they could have at all &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, it mu&s;t have been &s;everal Ages before they could have beat out any thing of a tolerable Scheme of Life.&mdash;It cannot there|fore be, but they mu&s;t have been immediately in&s;truct|ed and put into a State of moral Government, accord|ing to the Tenor of which they &s;hould be happy or mi&s;erable, according as they &s;hould behave them&s;elves well or ill:&mdash; Be obedient or di&s;obedient to his In|&s;tructions and Injunctions, under the Sanctions of Life or Death.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I thank you for yours of the 2d. and am very glad that you took in &s;o good part, the friendly and well-meant Free|dom I u&s;ed, in expo&s;tulating with you, on Account of your not frequenting the public Wor&s;hip &s;o much as you ought, and u&s;ed to do.&mdash;Had you varied only in &s;ome meerly <HI>&s;peculative</HI> and doubtful, or indifferent Point, the Mat|ter were not &s;o much:&mdash; But what I wrote about was a <HI>practical</HI> Affair, and &s;uch an one, as I think mu&s;t evidently appear, to any one that thinks &s;eriou&s;ly, of the greate&s;t Importance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Thing in the World be&s;ide.&mdash; It was a Matter indeed both of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Right,</HI> re&s;ulting even from &s;trict Demon&s;tration; for &s;o I mu&s;t think the Duty of publickly wor&s;hipping the Deity, as well as in private, evidently is.&mdash;It is a Matter of &s;trict <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> from which no moral Agent can be at Liberty to vary. For all Morali&s;t's mu&s;t and do allow, that <HI>Gratitude</HI> is &s;trictly due from Dependents to a Benefactor, and the Wor&s;hip of GOD is in effect nothing el&s;e but our Expre&s;&s;ion of Gratitude, and of our due Sen&s;e of our Dependence on him, and Submi&s;|&s;ion to him, as our Supreme Father, Lord and Governor, and mo&s;t kind Friend and Benefactor. See <HI>Walle&s;ton,</HI> R. N. p. 124, 5, 6, or 124&mdash; to 126.</P>
<P>And methinks he mu&s;t have a very depraved Mind who does not &s;ee, that our con&s;tant holding this Intercour&s;e with the Father of our Spirits, who is the Light and Life of our Souls, and the great Source and Patern of all moral Perfection, is, in the Nature of the Thing, directly connected with every good Temper, and virtuous Di&s;po&s;ition, wherein the true Perfection and Happine&s;s of every rea&s;onable and immortal Nature con|&s;i&s;ts:&mdash; And moreover, That to do this fir&s;t, and mo&s;t rea&s;ona|ble Act of Ju&s;tice and Duty, openly and jointly, in Society with our Friends and Neighbours, as Brethren and Children of the &s;ame common heavenly Parent, does, in the Nature of it, happily tend to conciliate Benevolence, and promote every &s;o|cial, as well as per&s;onal Virtue, wherein the public Weal and Happine&s;s of Mankind con&s;i&s;ts; and con&s;equently that the Ex|ample of a contrary Conduct, in neglecting &s;o important a Duty,
<PB N="2" REF="008627_0029_103167C677394888">
mu&s;t be really Criminal; (va&s;tly more Criminal than open In|gratitude to a human Benefactor, as ba&s;e and injurious as that is accounted) e&s;pecially in Per&s;ons of Education and public In|fluence in the Society: It mu&s;t be Criminal, not only again&s;t their own Souls, but even again&s;t the Society it&s;elf, as well as the common Parent and Lord of the whole &s;ocial Sy&s;tem, the great <HI>Father of whom the whole Family of Heaven and Earth is named.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>But you &s;ay, I am not &s;atisfied in this, or that, or <HI>any parti|cular Sy&s;tem,</HI> &amp;c. Dear Sir, I beg in the Name of Truth, Can|dor, and Benevolence; is it fit you &s;hould neglect the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t important Duty, both to your Maker and great Bene|factor&punc; and to the Society whereof you are a Member, as well as to your own Soul, till you can do it in Company where every thing is intirely perfect, according to your Notion of Things? Can you make no Allowances for the Mi&s;takes and Differences among Chri&s;tians which yet perhaps, in many In&s;tances, may be chiefly, if not only, in Sounds?&mdash;Would not Candor di&s;po&s;e you to put the be&s;t and mo&s;t favourable Con&s;truction, e&s;pecially on &s;uch Things as have the Sanction of the public Sen&s;e and Authority? And would not a Sen&s;e of Duty di&s;po&s;e you, if po&s;|&s;ible to conform to it?&mdash; Is there not &s;omething extremely inde|corous in an Affectation of Singularity:mdash;And what I be&s;eech you, do you think would in a little Time become of all public Virtue and Order, and indeed of every thing that is amiable among Mankind, if every one &s;hould renounce the open Wor|&s;hip of the Deity, which one may do as well as another, and the le&s;&s;er People will &s;oon be apt to learn to do, from the Greater? &mdash;How can you endure &s;o much as the Appearance of having a Hand in &s;uch public Havock? It is &s;hocking and deplorable to &s;ee the Churches already &s;o much de&s;erted. And then, what a hideous Thing mu&s;t it be, for a Family of young Children to be bred up under the Example of a Parent that &s;hews no open Re|gard to the God that made them, and the Saviour that redeemed them?&mdash; What can be expected, if they have any regard for their Parent, but that they will learn from his Example, <HI>to have no Fear of God before their Eyes</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For you know, <HI>non exi&s;tentis, &amp; non apparentis, eadem e&s;t Ratio.</HI> If it does not appear by outward Expre&s;&s;ion and Behaviour, it will not be thought to exi&s;t at all.</NOTE>; the Con&s;equence of which will be, that they will of Cour&s;e run into all manner of Vices, that will de&s;troy them in the mid&s;t of their Days!&mdash; As the Fact has &s;adly been in innumerable In&s;tances in this mi&s;erable Age, in Con&s;e|quence of tho&s;e licentious Principles that now obtain and i&s;&s;ue in the neglect and contempt of all public Religion, as well as private.&mdash;On which Account methinks (&s;uppo&s;ing nothing <HI>evi|dently</HI>

how, rather than not at all, and according to any Sy&s;tem rather than none. Nay I prote&s;t, if it were po&s;&s;ible for me to believe Chri&s;|tianity and it's Sacraments to be but a meer human Contrivance, yet it's Moral is &s;o excellent, and it's Doctrines and Rites do &s;o evidently tend to purify the Heart, and to promote Devo|tion, and univer&s;al Ju&s;tice and Benevolence, and all kinds of Virtue, that I would &s;teadily attend upon all it's public Offices, and by my Example and Influence, do all the Honour I could to it, for the &s;ake of the public good of Mankind.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am verily per&s;waded that Popery it&s;elf, as bad as it is, does nothing near the Mi&s;chief towards de&s;troying the Virtue and morals of Mankind, as Sceptici&s;m, and the loo&s;e Notions that are &s;o much in vogue in our unhappy Nation, and in the&s;e de|generate and apo&s;tatizing Days. How inexcu&s;able then mu&s;t it be to neglect &s;o excellent a Method of Wor&s;hip, as that in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially in one that does not doubt, as you profe&s;s&punc; that the <HI>Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem is a divine Revelation?</HI>&mdash; If &s;o, how can you he&s;itate a Moment, to wor&s;hip God accord|ing to a Liturgy that is very little el&s;e but a judicious Collection out of that very Sy&s;tem, the Holy Scriptures, which you profe&s;s to believe?&mdash; If there be &s;ome few Pa&s;&s;ages in it that you are not well &s;atisfied in, or that imply Doctrines about which you doubt, yet &s;o long as you are not obliged to a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e Particulars, they ought by no Means to tempt you to neglect a plain and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Duty: And even tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, if you would con&s;ider them with Candor, and a Di&s;po&s;ition to under&s;tand them in &s;uch a Sen&s;e, as, putting the mo&s;t favourable Con&s;truc|tion upon them, they would well admit of, you might at lea&s;t bear with them. You ought &s;urely to con&s;ider them, (having the Sanction of Authority) at lea&s;t with the like Candor, as <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays he would have for any Author, in that fine Pa&s;&s;age of his,&mdash;<HI>ubi plura ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, non ego paucis, Offendar Maculis, quas aut incuria fudit, aut humana parum cavit natura.</HI>&mdash; "I will not, &s;ays he, be offended at a few Faults, which are owing to Inat|tention, or the unavoidable Frailty of human Nature."&mdash;<HI>Sine crimine nemo, optimus ille qui minimis urgetur.</HI>&mdash; "None he adds are without &s;ome fault, he is the be&s;t who has fewe&s;t,"&mdash; It is moreover even demon&s;trably the Re&s;ult of all true Philo&s;ophy and exact Thinking, as well as Chri&s;tianity, to lead us directly to God, and to the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;erious Sen&s;e of our intire Dependence upon him, and our va&s;t Obligations to his infinite Goodne&s;s: It mu&s;t therefore be a mo&s;t mad and <HI>vain Philo&s;ophy</HI>
indeed, and <HI>Science fal&s;ly &s;o called,</HI> that tends to alienate our Minds from him, or tempt us to neglect the con&s;tant Adoration of him, both &s;everally and &s;ocially.

<P>There is one thing more in your Letter I beg Leave to remark upon, and I have done; and that is, your Notion, That <HI>no Man &s;hall be accountable, or puni&s;hable for believing, or di&s;believing &amp;c. as being out of his Power, &amp;c.</HI>&mdash; I agree with you that no Man is accountable for what is out of his Power, under &s;uch Means and A&s;&s;i&s;tances as God allows him; and al&s;o, that in many Ca&s;es it is out of our Power to yield or withhold our A&s;&s;ent: But this is only in Matters of pure <HI>Science,</HI> either <HI>Intuitive</HI> or <HI>Demon|&s;trative,</HI> where our Minds are pa&s;&s;ive to the clear Light of Truth: However even here, we may abu&s;e our Liberty, by neglecting to give our Attention, or take Time to con&s;ider, &amp;c.&mdash; But there are many Ca&s;es &s;hort of Intuition or Demon&s;tration, and tho&s;e of very great Importance, in which we are obliged either to act or forbear, and in which it may require much Thought and Care, in order to make up a ju&s;t Judgment among Probabilities and Rea&s;ons of Credibility, which ought to preponderate and determine a wi&s;e and con&s;iderate Man; in doing which he mu&s;t be active. And he mu&s;t be a great Stranger to human Nature, who does not know that Men do many Times criminally bring them&s;elves to be per&s;waded of &s;ome of the ab&s;urde&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;cheivous Things in the World.&mdash; <HI>Quod volumus facile credimus,</HI> "What we &s;trongly de&s;ire, we are ea&s;ily induced to believe. Where Men's Pride, Lu&s;ts, Prejudices, Intere&s;ts, Conver&s;ations, &amp;c. are in one Scale, they will often &s;trongly weigh down again&s;t the highe&s;t Probabilities, and even moral Certainty in the other; nay many Times induce them to believe, as well as to act wrong, in &s;pite of Demon&s;trati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> it&s;elf.&mdash; A very wi&s;e Man tells us, <HI>There is a Way that &s;eemeth Right to a Man, when the End thereof is the Ways of Death;</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us of &s;ome, who, becau&s;e they <HI>re|ceived not the Love of the Truth, but had Plea&s;ure in Unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, were left to &s;trong Delu&s;ions to believe a Lie,</HI> to their final De|&s;truction. We &s;hould therefore take Care how we give into that fa&s;hionable Doctrine of <HI>the Innocency of Error,</HI> and be very diffi|dent of our&s;elves, and very jealous lea&s;t &s;ome wrong Temper, or Di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould prevail in us to bya&s;s our Judgments, and make us &s;ee Things otherwi&s;e than they really are, as it were thro' a coloured Gla&s;s, or a di&s;tempered Eye, and remember that Things are inflexible: We cannot alter them by our Imaginati|ons: They will be ju&s;t what they are, let us think of them how we plea&s;e. Our be&s;t Way therefore is, with great Humility, Candor and Docility, to bend our Minds to them, and endeavour
<PB N="5" REF="008627_0032_103167CD7352EE68">
to think of them exactly as they are, and guard again&s;t a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of Self-&s;ufficiency, <HI>and leaning too much to our own Under&s;tanding,</HI>
particularly, when we find our&s;elves tempted to vary (and e&s;peci|ally in Practice) from the public Sen&s;e and Practice of the Com|munity and of many of the wi&s;e&s;t, the greate&s;t and be&s;t of the human Kind.&mdash;And where Things yet remain &s;omewhat doubt|ful, the &s;afe&s;t Side may however be very evident: And &s;urely he mu&s;t be be&s;ide him&s;elf, who does not, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, religiou&s;ly and &s;teadily adhere to the &s;afe&s;t Side; and who can doubt in the Ca&s;e before us which that is?</P>
<P>In a Word, let us thoroughly know our&s;elves, and be deeply &s;en&s;ible that the Mind of Man is, at be&s;t, but a poor frail Crea|ture of it&s;elf, and &s;tands in the greate&s;t Need of the Divine In|&s;truction, Conduct and A&s;&s;i&s;tance: There is therefore no better Cour&s;e we can take, than that &s;ugge&s;ted by the wi&s;e King&punc; <HI>In all our ways to acknowledge God,</HI> and then we may confide in him to <HI>direct our Paths;</HI> and that of a Wi&s;er than he, who tells us, <HI>If a Man will do his Will, he &s;hall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God.</HI>&mdash;I am grieved to hear you complain of <HI>endle&s;s Doubts and Perplexities</HI> in Matters of Religion, for it is indeed a mi&s;erable State to be worried with a Spirit of Sceptici&s;m, and dark Su&s;pi|cions and Surmizes about this, and that, and t'other.&mdash;<HI>Nubila me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> e&s;t haet ubi regnant.</HI>&mdash;"It is a cloudy doleful State of Mind where the&s;e prevail."&mdash; Pray &s;it down then, and carefully di&s;|tingui&s;h and &s;eparate Things certain from Things doubtful, and abide by them, and give the Doubts to the Winds; but never doubt whether you ought diligently to attend on the public Ser|vice of God.&mdash; Attend, I &s;ay, in the fir&s;t Place, and above all Things, to plain evident practical Matters, and e&s;pecially live in the con&s;tant regular practice of true Devotion towards God in Chri&s;t, who is our only &s;upreme Good; and trouble not your Head with curious Di&s;putes and Speculations, and perplexing Doubts and Intricacies, many of which, are only <HI>Strifes about Words,</HI> and others, about Things we have no concern with, and Things quite beyond our Faculties.</P>
