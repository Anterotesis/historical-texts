<HEAD>FROM THE CRITICAL REVIEW, For September, 1788.</HEAD>
<Q><P>OUR Author, with great candour and exten&s;ive knowledge of the &s;ubject, di&s;cu&s;&s;es the doctrine of eter|nal puni&s;hments. He thinks that there will be a period when every &s;inner will be re&s;tored to the Divine favour. This doctrine is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the benevo|lence of the Deity. It is &s;upported by many wi&s;e and good men; nor is there any rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it will be perverted to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of vice and immora|lity. Mr. Winche&s;ter, in his defence of it, &s;hews much charity, much humanity, and no little &s;hare of learning: The fifth Dialogue alone, which relates to the de&s;ign and tendency of puni&s;hment, might furni&s;h &s;ome little foundation for a difference of opinion; but, in a que&s;ti|on &s;o greatly above human attainment, the mind would be lo&s;t in the enquiry, and not greatly benefited by the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The que&s;tion of the univer&s;al Re&s;toration, mu&s;t be examined as Mr. Winche&s;ter has done, by the word of God, as revealed at different times, and parti|cularly in the Go&s;pel.</P></Q>
<P>N. B. A con&s;iderable part of the fifth Dialogue, being printed in the Lectures on the Prophecies, is left out of this edition, and the remaining part is included in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fourth Dialogue.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>AS I now pre&s;ent my Friends and the Public with a new edition of the Dialogues on the UNIVERSAL RESTORATION, which by many has been long de&s;ired, perhaps it may be acceptable to &s;ome for me to give a brief account how I came fir&s;t to the knowledge of this part of the coun&s;el of God, which I have not &s;hunned freely to de|clare, both by word and writing, as I have found opportunity and nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>I think it was in the beginning of the year 1778, being in South Carolina, upon the River <HI>Pee Dee,</HI> where I was at that time Mini&s;ter, that I called to &s;ee a friend, who fir&s;t put into my hands that va|luable book written by <HI>Paul Siegvolk,</HI> and which is called <HI>The Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel,</HI> of which I have lately publi&s;hed a new edition. I was de&s;ired to tell what it meant to hold forth, as my friend could not tell by any means what to make of it on the account of the &s;ingularity and &s;trangene&s;s of the &s;entiments therein contained; although the language is very plain and clear, and by no means dark, my&s;tical, or ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>I opened the book as I was de&s;ired, and dipping into it here and there, for half an hour perhaps, was very &s;oon able to tell what the Author aimed at, viz. <HI>that there would be a final end of &s;in and
<PB N="iv" REF="025050_0004_102D75B2C3F7DE80">
mi&s;ery, and that all fallen creatures would be re&s;tored, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to a &s;tate of holine&s;s and happine&s;s, after &s;uch as were rebellious had &s;uffered in proportion to their crimes.</HI> I had never &s;een any thing of the &s;ort before in all my life; and I &s;eemed &s;truck with &s;everal ideas that I glanced over, &s;uch as the incon&s;i&s;tency and impo&s;&s;ibility of both good and evil always exi&s;ting in the univer&s;e; and e&s;|pecially his ob&s;ervations upon the word <HI>eternal</HI> or <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> &s;hewing that it was u&s;ed for what ne|ver had a beginning, and would never have an end, as the being and perfections of God; and that it was al&s;o applied to things which had a be|ginning, but &s;hould never have an end, as the be|ing and happine&s;s of the righteous; and, that it was al&s;o frequently u&s;ed to expre&s;s things, times, and &s;ea&s;ons which had both beginning and end. which he therefore called <HI>periodical eternities,</HI> and gave a great number of in&s;tances of this &s;ort, which could not be denied; and he contended that the <HI>everla&s;ting puni&s;hment</HI> threatened to the wicked, did not belong to the fir&s;t, nor to the &s;econd, but to the third cla&s;s of the&s;e durations.</P>
<P>But as I was only de&s;ired to tell what the au|thor meant, when I had &s;atisfied my friend in that re&s;pect, I laid the book down, and I believe, we both concluded it to be a plea&s;ant ingenious hy|pothe&s;is, but had no &s;erious thoughts of its being true; and for my part, I determined not to trou|ble my&s;elf about it, or to think any thing more of the matter. And as the book had been &s;ent a con&s;iderable di&s;tance for my friend to read, I &s;up|po&s;e it was &s;oon after &s;ent back; for I &s;aw it no more, nor heard any thing farther about it. The The following &s;ummer I went a journey into <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="025050_0005_102D702A9D161F08">
and happening to mention the &s;ubject to a mini&s;ter there, he told me that a few years before, it had been a &s;ubject of controver&s;y in the public papers, between a clergyman, who defended, and a gentleman of the law, who denied the proper <HI>endle&s;s</HI> eternity of puni&s;hment; and he told me that this gentleman who denied it, had advanced, that the tran&s;lators of the Bible had rendered the very &s;ame Greek word, by very different Engli&s;h words, &s;ometimes rendering it <HI>for ever,</HI> and &s;ome|times <HI>world;</HI> and that if they had always uni|formly rendered it by one Engli&s;h word, it would have been evident to all readers, that no argu|ment for <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery,</HI> could have been drawn therefrom. I was told al&s;o while I was in <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI> that a clergyman of the epi&s;copal church, had a few years before, given out that he had &s;ome wonderful thing to make known to his hear|ers, which he would preach upon &s;ome Sunday, but did not mention when. This rai&s;ed the pub|lic curio&s;ity, and great numbers attended his place of wor&s;hip in hopes of hearing what this wonderful thing might be; but for a con&s;idera|ble time the matter was undi&s;covered. But at la&s;t he gave out, that on the next Sunday he would open this great &s;ecret. Va&s;t numbers of people flocked to hear what it could be; When he came to declare what it was, behold! it was a wonder|ful piece of news indeed, &s;uch as had never been heard before in any pulpit in <HI>Virginia.</HI> It was nothing &s;hort of the doctrine of the <HI>Re&s;toration.</HI> I think, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, they told me, that he opened and enlarged upon it for two Sundays, and never preached any more, being immediately after &s;eized with &s;ickne&s;s, which ter|minated
<PB N="vi" REF="025050_0006_102D75B4FB4293F8">
in his death. And this was generally e&s;teemed as a judgment that fell upon him for daring to preach &s;uch a wicked, fal&s;e, and dange|rous opinion; and that God cut him off from the land of the living, to te&s;tify his di&s;plea&s;ure a|gain&s;t him; and to terrify others from daring to follow his example, or believe his &s;entiments. But perhaps this might have been &s;ome worthy, learned, pious man, who had long concealed this grand truth in his heart, and had derived much &s;atisfaction therefrom, and longed to proclaim it to others, for their good. And at la&s;t, notwith|&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition that he might expect, re|&s;olved &s;o to do; and accordingly was enabled, ju&s;t before his time came to depart out of this world, to bear a faithful te&s;timony to this mo&s;t grand and important of all God's purpo&s;es. And having performed his duty, his ma&s;ter called him to receive his reward, and gave him the glorious plaudit of, 'Well done, thou good and faithful &s;ervant;&mdash;enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'</P>
<P>As for the vain judgments of men they are not to be regarded. 'For they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither under&s;tand they his coun&s;el.' 'But the &s;ouls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there &s;hall no torment touch them. In the &s;ight of the unwi&s;e they &s;eemed to die; and their departure is taken for mi&s;ery. And their going from us to be utter de&s;truction; but they are in peace. For though they be puni&s;hed in the &s;ight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality. And having been a little cha&s;ti&s;ed, they &s;hall be greatly rewarded; for God proved them, and found them worthy for him&s;elf. As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and hath received them as a burnt-offering.
<PB N="vii" REF="025050_0007_102D702C4A7DAB40">
And in the time of their vi&s;itation, they &s;hall &s;hine, and run to and fro, like &s;parks among the &s;tubble. They &s;hall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord &s;hall reign for ever. They that put their tru&s;t in him &s;hall under&s;tand the truth; and &s;uch as be faithful in love &s;hall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his &s;aints, and he hath care for his elect.' 'But though the righteous be pre|vented with death, yet &s;hall he be in re&s;t.'</P>
<P>I am apt to think therefore, that this mini&s;ter was one of uncommon faith and love, and as he be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed God, &s;o he loved mankind, and wi&s;hed them to know the amazing riches of their Re|deemer's love towards them: and when he had openly delivered this te&s;timony, he was called to his re&s;t.</P>
<P>Indeed if the enemies of this doctrine had been true prophets, I &s;hould have died and gone to hell long ago; for no &s;ooner was it known I had embraced it, but &s;ome gave out that I would not live a year; but I have already lived eleven. One of my old friends de&s;ired me to take particular no|tice of what he &s;aid, which he expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e words, 'Mind what I tell you. In &s;ix months from this time, you will turn Dei&s;t, and deny all re|vealed religion: and in twelve months you will turn Athei&s;t, deny the being of God, and abandon your&s;elf to all kinds of open wickedne&s;s.' Ble&s;&s;ed be God, this has al&s;o proved fal&s;e. And they ge|nerally &s;eemed to agree to prophe&s;y certain dam|nation to me whenever I &s;hould depart out of this world. But I tru&s;t this is equally fal&s;e, 'For I know whom I have believed, (or tru&s;ted) and am
<PB N="viii" REF="025050_0008_102D75B6EF00D258">
per&s;uaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him again&s;t that day.'</P>
<P>But to return to my narrative,</P>
<P>Sometime after I returned back to <HI>South-Caro|lina,</HI> a Phy&s;ician with whom I had been acquaint|ed in <HI>Virginia,</HI> came to live in the pari&s;h where I was mini&s;ter; and among his books I found <HI>the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel,</HI> by <HI>Paul Siegvolk;</HI> this was the &s;econd copy that had fell in my way, and I read a little more therein, but as yet had not the lea&s;t thought that ever I &s;hould embrace his &s;entiments; yet &s;ome of his arguments appeared very conclu|&s;ive, and I could not wholly &s;hake them off, but I concluded to let them alone, and not inve&s;ti|gate the matter; and therefore I never gave the book even &s;o much as one cur&s;ory reading, till with great difficulty I procured one in the city of Philadelphia, more than two years afterwards.</P>
<P>In the year 1779, I found my&s;elf much &s;tirred up to exhort my fellow creatures to repent, be|lieve, and obey the Go&s;pel, and began to adopt a more open and general method of preaching than I had u&s;ed for &s;ome years before; having been deemed one of the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent Calvini&s;ts upon the continent, much upon the plan of Dr. <HI>Gill,</HI> whom I e&s;teemed almo&s;t as an oracle. But now my heart being opened, and viewing the worth of &s;ouls, I felt great compa&s;&s;ion towards them, and invited them with all my might to fly for mercy to the arms of Chri&s;t, who died for them, and who was willing to &s;ave them. I was gradually led into this way of preaching, without con&s;idering any thing about its con&s;i&s;tency with &s;trict calvini&s;m, but finding my&s;elf very happy and comfortable in my own mind, and that this
<PB N="ix" REF="025050_0009_102D702E242E7B50">
method of preaching was highly u&s;eful, I conti|nued to go in the &s;ame cour&s;e.</P>
<P>About this time I began to find uncommon de|&s;ires for the conver&s;ion and &s;alvation of the poor negroes, who were very numerous in that part of the country; but whom none of my predece&s;&s;ors, that I could learn, had ever taken pains to in&s;truct in the principles of Chri&s;tianity; neither had any &s;ingle &s;lave, either man, or woman been baptized until that &s;ummer, in the whole pari&s;h (which was very large) that I ever heard of.</P>
<P>The prejudices which the &s;laves had again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, on account of the &s;everities practi&s;ed upon them by profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, both mini&s;ters and people, might be one principal rea&s;on why they could not be brought to attend to religious in&s;tructions. But they had no prejudice again&s;t me on that &s;core, as I never had any thing to do with &s;lavery, but on the contrary condemned it; and this being pretty generally known, operated &s;o upon the minds of tho&s;e poor creatures, that they &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to attend my mini&s;try, more than they had ever &s;hewed to any other. But &s;till I never had addre&s;&s;ed them in particular, and indeed had hardly any hopes of doing them good. But one evening &s;eeing a great number of them at the door of the hou&s;e where I was preach|ing, I found my&s;elf con&s;trained as it were, to go to the door, and tell them, That Je&s;us Chri&s;t loved them, and died for them, as well as for us white people, and that they might come and be|lieve in him, and welcome. And I gave them as warm and pre&s;&s;ing an invitation as I could, to comply with the glorious go&s;pel. This &s;hort di&s;|cour&s;e addre&s;&s;ed immediately to them, took great|er
<PB N="x" REF="025050_0010_102D75B8DA85BFC8">
effect than can well be imagined. There were about thirty from one plantation in the neighbour|hood pre&s;ent; (be&s;ides others) the&s;e returned home, and did not even give &s;leep to their eyes, as they afterwards informed me, until they had &s;ettled every quarrel among them&s;elves, and ac|cording to their form of marriage, had married e|very man to the woman with whom he lived; had re&s;tored whatever one had unju&s;tly taken from a|nother; and determined from that time to &s;eek the Lord diligently. From that very evening they began con&s;tantly to pray to the Lord, and &s;o con|tinued; and he was found of them. I continued to in&s;truct them, and within three months from the fir&s;t of June, I baptized more than thirty blacks belonging to that plantation, be&s;ides as many others, as in the whole made up one hun|dred, of which &s;ixty three were men, and thirty-&s;even were women, all which were born in <HI>Afri|ca,</HI> or immediately de&s;cended from &s;uch as were natives of that unhappy country.</P>
<P>My preaching was not only u&s;eful to the poor &s;laves, but al&s;o to great numbers of the white people, of whom I baptized upon profe&s;&s;ion of repentance and faith in Chri&s;t, about one hundred and thirty-nine per&s;ons within the &s;ame &s;pace. This was a &s;ummer of great &s;ucce&s;s, and I &s;hall remember that happy &s;ea&s;on with plea&s;ure while I live. This &s;ummer I received &s;ome farther dawn|ings of the day of the general Re&s;toration in my mind, for upon con&s;idering &s;everal Scriptures, &s;uch as the&s;e, 'He &s;hall &s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul, and &s;hall be &s;atisfied; by his knowledge &s;hall my righteous &s;ervant ju&s;tify many; for he &s;hall bear their iniquities,' I&s;ai. liii. 11. 'After this I beheld,
<PB N="xi" REF="025050_0011_102D702FECBDF6D8">
lo, a great multitude, which no man could num|ber, of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, &s;tood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands' Rev. vii. 9. I became fully per|&s;uaded that the number of the finally &s;aved would equal, if not exceed the number of the lo&s;t. And I was &s;o forcibly impre&s;&s;ed with this new and very joyful di&s;covery, that I not only conver&s;ed in that &s;train privately, but boldly preached it in the con|gregation, which generally con&s;i&s;ted of nearly a thou&s;and per&s;ons upon Sundays. Some of the people to whom I had mentioned &s;omething re|&s;pecting the &s;entiment, thought that I was going at once to declare my&s;elf in favour of the <HI>general Re&s;toration.</HI> But that was as yet far from being the ca&s;e; though &s;ome of the arguments which I had glanced upon in that book, <HI>the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel,</HI> would frequently pre&s;ent them&s;elves to my mind in &s;uch a forcible manner that I could &s;carcely with&s;tand their evidence.</P>
<P>In the month of September I left <HI>South-Caroli|na,</HI> on a vi&s;it to my friends in <HI>New England,</HI> in|tending however to return to my people again; but to prevent their being left de&s;titute, I procur|ed the Rev. Mr. <HI>Botsford</HI> to come and &s;upply them, upon this condition, that whenever I &s;hould re|turn, he &s;hould re&s;ign the congregation to me a|gain, if I required it. But he has remained the con&s;tant Pa&s;tor ever &s;ince. I then travelled &s;low|ly through the continent preaching to the peo|ple, and conver&s;ing with my friends, to whom &s;ometimes in private I propo&s;ed &s;ome of the argu|ments in favour of the <HI>general Re&s;toration,</HI> which I had read in the <HI>Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel,</HI> on purpo&s;e
<PB N="xii" REF="025050_0012_102D75BA6F587FA8">
&s;ee what an&s;wers they could give; and this I did e&s;pecially to able mini&s;ters; but to my &s;urpri&s;e often found them quite at a &s;tand, not knowing what to &s;ay. And &s;ome were almo&s;t overpower|ed, with even the weak manner in which I was capable of holding forth the arguments in favour of the <HI>Re&s;toration.</HI> And oftentimes the an&s;wers that &s;ome of the greate&s;t men gave, were &s;uch as tended to increa&s;e my doubts re&s;pecting <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery,</HI> rather than to remove them. I remember once, that I a&s;ked the Rev. Mr. <HI>Manning,</HI> Pre&s;i|dent of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> College, and who was at that time one of my deare&s;t friends, what was the &s;tronge&s;t argument that he could u&s;e in favour of the doctrine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery? He an&s;wered, That it was the nature of God, to lay the great|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible re&s;traint upon &s;in, and therefore he had threatened it with <HI>endle&s;s puni&s;hment,</HI> as the highe&s;t re&s;traint he could po&s;&s;ibly lay upon it. This argument is an&s;wered in the third Dialogue. Thus after much &s;eeking I could find no &s;atisfac|tion in the matter; but &s;till my doubts increa&s;ed. Notwith&s;tanding, I with&s;tood the doctrine of the <HI>Re&s;toration</HI> with all my might, and &s;ometimes preach|ed publicly again&s;t it with all the force I could mu&s;|ter. Yet there was &s;omething in its favour that gained gradually upon my mind, and &s;ometimes brought me to be almo&s;t willing to embrace it. I plainly &s;aw that it would reconcile almo&s;t, if not quite, all the difficulties of other &s;y&s;tems; and I thought if I &s;hould ever receive it, I &s;hould be able to preach much ea&s;ier, and more freely than ever, and with far greater &s;atisfaction, which by experience, I have &s;ince found to be true. The ideas were &s;ome|times &s;o tran&s;porting to me, even while I profe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="xiii" REF="025050_0013_102D758CE78366F8">
to oppo&s;e the &s;entiment, that I have been con&s;train|ed to &s;et them forth in the mo&s;t &s;ublime manner that I was able; and &s;ometimes &s;o as actually to bring them who heard me conver&s;e upon the &s;ub|ject to believe and rejoice in the <HI>Univer&s;al Re&s;tora|tion,</HI> while I thought my&s;elf an oppo&s;er of it, and only propo&s;ed the arguments in its favour to &s;ee what effect they would have on &s;uch who never heard them before. And I was often carried away before I was aware, even while I intended only to let my friends hear what might be &s;aid. I remember once, while I was at my father's table in the year 1780, that I mentioned the doctrine of the <HI>Re&s;toration,</HI> and finding that none in company had ever &s;o much as heard of &s;uch a &s;cheme, I began to hold it forth, produced many arguments in its favour, brought up many objections, an&s;wer|ed them in &s;uch a manner as a&s;toni&s;hed all pre&s;ent, and I was amazed at my&s;elf, I &s;poke with &s;o much ea&s;e and readine&s;s as I had hardly ever experienced before on any occa&s;ion. Nay, I was &s;o much ani|mated with the &s;ubject that I &s;aid, That I did not doubt but that in &s;ixty years time, that very doc|trine would univer&s;ally be preached, and generally embraced in that very country, and would certain|ly prevail over all oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e made a greater impre&s;&s;ion upon the minds of tho&s;e who heard it, and upon my own al&s;o, than I intended; and though I after|wards u&s;ed the be&s;t arguments I could in favour of the common opinion, yet I found them in&s;uffi|cient wholly to remove the effects of what I had before &s;aid.</P>
<P>After &s;pending about twelve months in the mo&s;t delightful manner, con&s;tantly journeying and
<PB N="xiv" REF="025050_0014_102D75BC95E17890">
preaching with great &s;ucce&s;s, to va&s;t multitudes of people in my native country, I &s;et off with inten|tion to return towards <HI>South-Carolina.</HI> On the way I tarried &s;ome time at the hou&s;e of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Samuel Waldo,</HI> in <HI>Pawling's Precinct,</HI> &s;tate of <HI>New-York,</HI> who&s;e kind and friendly behaviour to|wards me I remember with plea&s;ure, and mention with gratitude. I had a great deal of very agree|able conver&s;ation with him upon the matter, and he did not &s;eem to oppo&s;e the ideas hardly at all; but only gently cautioned me again&s;t receiving any thing erroneous. He is a man of a mo&s;t excel|lent &s;pirit, and his family was upon the whole the mo&s;t delightful, agreeable, and happy family that I ever knew. While I was at his hou&s;e one of his children, then about twenty years of age, &s;eemed fully convinced of the truth of the doctrine, by li&s;tening to our conver&s;ation, and was filled with great joy at the idea. Several religious men who were on a journey, lodged at the hou&s;e while I was there, got a hint of the matter, and wi&s;hed to hear all that I could &s;ay in defence of it; I ac|cordingly gave them &s;ome of the principal argu|ments in its favour, and obviated &s;ome of the mo&s;t capital objections that could be brought again&s;t it; and I afterwards overheard them wi&s;hing that they had not been &s;o curious as to have enquired &s;o far into the &s;ubject, for they could not re&s;i&s;t the argu|ments, although they &s;eemed re&s;olved to treat the &s;entiment as an error.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of mind, half a convert to the doc|trine of the <HI>Re&s;toration,</HI> I arrived in the city of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on the 7th of October, 1780. I in|tended to have left the city in a few days, and to have gone on towards <HI>South-Cnrolina,</HI> but the Bap|ti&s;t
<PB N="xv" REF="025050_0015_102D758EC8815A58">
church being de&s;titute of a mini&s;ter, they in|vited me to &s;top and preach with them, to which I was at length per&s;uaded, and for &s;ome time I was much followed, and there were great additions to the church. The congregations increa&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, e&s;pecially on Sunday-evenings, that our place of wor&s;hip, though large, would by no means contain them; at length leave was a&s;ked by &s;ome of my friends for me to preach in the church of St. Paul, in that city, which was granted. This was one of the large&s;t hou&s;es of wor&s;hip in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and equal in bigne&s;s to mo&s;t of the churches in <HI>London.</HI> I think I preached there about eighteen &s;ermons, and generally to very crowded audiences, frequently more than could po&s;&s;ibly get into the hou&s;e; mo&s;t of the clergy, of every de|nomination in the city, heard me there, and many thou&s;ands of different people. I am inclined to think, that I never preached to &s;o many before nor &s;ince as I did &s;ometimes in that hou&s;e, and with almo&s;t univer&s;al approbation. But now the time of my trouble and ca&s;ting down came on, and thus it was.</P>
<P>Soon after I arrived in the city I had enquired of &s;ome friend for <HI>The Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel,</HI> which I could not light on for &s;ome time, but they lent me Mr. <HI>Stonehou&s;e's</HI> book upon the <HI>Re&s;litution of all Things,</HI> which I had never &s;een nor heard of be|fore; this very learned work I read with great care, and his rea&s;oning, arguments, and &s;cripture-proofs &s;eemed to me entirely &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>The friends who procured me the works of Mr. <HI>Stonehou&s;e,</HI> were concerned at my having an incli|nation to read any thing upon &s;uch a &s;ubject; ne|verthele&s;s, though there were &s;everal of them with
<PB N="xvi" REF="025050_0016_102D75BEC18E4120">
whom I conver&s;ed pretty freely upon the matter, and who knew of my reading Mr. <HI>Stonehou&s;e's</HI> works, yet they behaved in &s;o friendly a manner towards me, that they never mentioned a word of it to any, until by other means it come to be known and talked of.</P>
<P>In the hou&s;e where I lodged, when I fir&s;t came to the city I had, in the freedom of conver&s;ation, and with &s;ome appearance of joy, expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in general terms upon the &s;ubject, but always in the exact words of Scripture, or in &s;uch a manner as this, viz. That I could not help hoping that God would finally bring <HI>every knee to bow,</HI> and <HI>every tongue</HI> to <HI>&s;wear:</HI> and that <HI>at the name of Je|&s;us every knee &s;hould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth; and things under the earth; and that every tongue</HI> &s;hould <HI>confe&s;s</HI> JESUS CHRIST to be <HI>Lord to the glory of God the Father.</HI> And that I hoped, <HI>that in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, he might gather together in one all things in</HI> CHRIST, <HI>both which are in heaven, and which are on earth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Such pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e I mentioned in this man|ner, hoping that they would be fulfilled. The people of the hou&s;e &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed, and a&s;ked me if I believed &s;o: I an&s;wered, 'That &s;ometimes I could not help hoping that it might be &s;o.' I could hardly have imagined among friends, that any danger could have ari&s;en from my expre&s;&s;ing a hope that the Scriptures were true.</P>
<P>However the&s;e fal&s;e friends told a mini&s;ter, whom for a number of years I had e&s;teemed as my be&s;t and mo&s;t intimate friend, that I was turned heretic, and believed the doctrine of the <HI>Univer&s;al Re&s;toration,</HI> and de&s;ired him to convince me. Some
<PB N="xvii" REF="025050_0017_102D75908BBF7240">
time after he met with me in the &s;treet, and in a very abrupt manner told me, that he had wanted to &s;ee me for &s;ome time, that he might give me a piece of his mind; that he had been informed by &s;uch a per&s;on, that I was inclined to the doctrine of the <HI>Univer&s;al Re&s;toration,</HI> and then, in&s;tead of u&s;ing any argument to convince me, or taking any method for my recovery, added this <HI>laconic</HI> &s;peech, 'If you embrace this &s;entiment, I &s;hall no longer own you for a brother.' And he has hitherto been as good as his word, having never written nor &s;poken to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from that day to this; and when I have &s;ince offered to &s;hake hands with him, he has refu&s;ed; and yet he was one whom I e&s;teemed above any other on earth, as a hearty, &s;incere, long-tried, and faithful friend. If my intimate friend treated me in &s;uch a manner, what had I not to expect from my open and avowed ene|mies?</P>
<P>I now fore&s;aw the &s;torm, and I determined to prepare for it, not by denying what I had &s;aid, but by examining and determining for my&s;elf, whether the &s;entiment was according to Scripture or not. If I found that it was not, I was deter|mined to retract, but if it was, to hold it fa&s;t, let the con&s;equences be what they might. I had now no time to lo&s;e, I expected in a &s;hort time to be called to an account, and examined re&s;pecting this doctrine, and obliged either to <HI>defend</HI> or <HI>deny</HI> it; I was already too well per&s;uaded that it was true, to do the latter without he&s;itation, and yet not &s;uffi|ciently for the former. For this purpo&s;e, I &s;hut my&s;elf up chiefly in my chamber, read the Scrip|tures, and prayed to God to lead me into all truth, and not &s;uffer me to embrace any error; and I
<PB N="xviii" REF="025050_0018_102D75C08906E5D8">
think that with an upright mind, I laid my&s;elf open to believe whatever the Lord had revealed. It would be too long to tell all the teachings I had on this head; let it &s;uffice, in &s;hort, to &s;ay, That I became &s;o well per&s;uaded of the truth of the <HI>Univer&s;al Re&s;toration,</HI> that I was determined never to deny it, let it co&s;t me ever &s;o much, though all my numerous friends &s;hould for&s;ake me, as I expected they would, and though I &s;hould be dri|ven from men, and obliged to dwell in caves or dens of the earth, and feed on wild roots and ve|getables, and &s;uffer the lo&s;e of all things, friends, wealth, fame, health, character, and even life it&s;elf. The truth appeared to me more valuable than all things, and as I had found it, I was determined never to part with it, let what would be offered in exchange.</P>
<P>I had now formed my re&s;olution, and was de|termined how to act when the trial came. Hitherto I had &s;aid nothing about the <HI>Re&s;toration</HI> in public, and but little in private; but I preached up the death of Chri&s;t, and &s;alvation for mankind through him, without re&s;triction. This free manner of preaching gave offence to &s;ome, who came to hear me no more. On the evening of the 22d of Janu|ary 1781, a number of the members of the church, who had heard that I held the doctrine of the <HI>Re&s;toration,</HI> met me at a friend's hou&s;e, to a&s;k me the que&s;tion, Whether I did or not? I acknow|ledged that I did, but did not wi&s;h to trouble any body with my &s;entiments. They de&s;ired me neither to preach them in public, nor to conver&s;e of them in private. I told them, That if they would pre|vent people from a&s;king me, I would &s;ay nothing upon the matter; but if people a&s;ked me concern|ing
<PB N="xix" REF="025050_0019_102D75928D393D18">
my &s;entiments, I could not deny them, and if they wi&s;hed to know the rea&s;ons, I mu&s;t inform them. And thus the matter was to re&s;t; but &s;ome that were pre&s;ent, wi&s;hed to know the foundation of my &s;entiments, others oppo&s;ed it, not wi&s;hing to hear any thing in its favour. At length it was agreed that I might read the pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture upon which I judged the doctrine of the <HI>Re&s;tora|tion</HI> to be founded, but mu&s;t not add a &s;ingle word of explanation on my part, and on their parts they were not to a&s;k any que&s;tions, or make the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition, for if they did, I in&s;i&s;ted upon the li|berty of defending.</P>
<P>Accordingly I took the Bible, and read many pa&s;&s;ages in the Old and New Te&s;taments, which I judged to contain the doctrine; and the very read|ing of them convinced &s;everal of the company of the truth of the <HI>Re&s;toration.</HI> There was nothing farther took place at that time: we parted with a mutual agreement; I was not to preach it in the pulpit, nor to introduce it in conver&s;ation, but I would not be obliged to deny it, when a&s;ked, nor to refu&s;e to vindicate it, if oppo&s;ed: and on their parts they were not to &s;peak of it to my prejudice, but to endeavour as much as po&s;&s;ible, to keep the the matter clo&s;e, and &s;o we parted. But notwith|&s;tanding all the pains that could be taken, the matter got abroad, and &s;everal came to di&s;cour&s;e with me on my principles, to whom I gave &s;uch rea&s;ons as I was able for what I believed. A lit|tle after this time, I met with another copy of the <HI>Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel,</HI> which I then read through with attention for the fir&s;t time, and found much &s;atis|faction; the arguments and Scripture proofs therein contained, &s;eemed to me &s;ufficient to con|vince
<PB N="xx" REF="025050_0020_102D75C2393C6F70">
all that would read with candour and atten|tion.</P>
<P>I &s;till continued to act only on the defen&s;ive, not preaching upon the &s;ubject, nor going about to private hou&s;es to make intere&s;t in my favour; but if any came to me and wi&s;hed me to di&s;cour&s;e upon it, I would not refu&s;e; and thus a number were convinced of its truth, while others violently op|po&s;ed it. And thus matters continued until the latter end of March. Having heard that the Ger|man Bapti&s;ts in <HI>Germantown,</HI> about 8 miles from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> held the doctrine of the <HI>Re&s;toration,</HI> I had appointed to &s;pend the fir&s;t Sunday in April with them; and this engagement had been made &s;ometime. Ju&s;t as I was ready to go out of the city on Saturday, I found that &s;ome of the mem|bers of the Church had privately &s;ent into the country, and collected a number of the able&s;t mi|ni&s;ters, who were arrived in the city on purpo&s;e to debate, I gave them the liberty of my pulpit as they plea&s;ed for the next day, and went out of the city to go to <HI>Germantown;</HI> and took that opportu|nity to go and vi&s;it that ancient, venerable, and ex|cellent man, Dr <HI>George De Benneville,</HI> who receiv|ed me in the mo&s;t kind, open, and friendly manner; and his conver&s;ation was mo&s;t highly edifying to me. Afterwards I went to <HI>Germantown,</HI> and lodged there all night, ready to preach the next day. As &s;oon as my enemies in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> found that I was gone out of the city, they &s;pread a re|port that I had fled to avoid an interview with the&s;e mini&s;ters, who had come on purpo&s;e to con|vince me. Nothing could have been more fal&s;e, than &s;uch a report, for I had been engaged to go to <HI>Germantown,</HI> on that day, for &s;everal weeks
<PB N="xxi" REF="025050_0021_102D759428B2DA90">
beforehand: I knew nothing of the&s;e Mini&s;ters be|ing &s;ent for until they came to town; and I had no fear but I &s;hould be able, by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to defend the cau&s;e before them; and be&s;ides, I had appointed to return on Monday, and did re|turn accordingly. The whole Church met, both my friends and my oppo&s;ers, and the&s;e Mini&s;ters met with them. I was called to attend a funeral at the time, and was at the hou&s;e of mourning, when a me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent in ha&s;te, to de&s;ire my immediate attendance at the meeting without any delay. I found that tho&s;e who were my enemies in the a&s;&s;embly, had been greatly vaunting over my friends, becau&s;e I was not pre&s;ent. They &s;aid I had ab&s;conded merely to avoid a debate, in which I was &s;ure to be confuted, as here was an oppor|tunity that might never pre&s;ent it&s;elf again; and &s;even wi&s;e, able, and learned Mini&s;ters had a&s;&s;em|bled on purpo&s;e to di&s;pute with me, but that I had gone, and left my adherents in the lurch, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that I was not able to defend my cau&s;e; with abundance more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. My friends, on the other hand, told them, That I was afraid of nothing but &s;in, and that they doubted not of my being able and willing to di&s;|pute with any one of the gentlemen, or all of them, one by one, if they cho&s;e it. O, no; they repli|ed, they knew better than that, I was gone out of the way on purpo&s;e, where I could not be found. My friends told them, That if there was a vote pa&s;t in the a&s;&s;embly that I &s;hould di&s;pute with any one, they would engage that I would be among them in a few minutes. It was accordingly una|nimou&s;ly voted, that I &s;hould di&s;pute with the <HI>Rev. Mr. Boggs,</HI> upon my &s;entiments, in the pre|&s;ence
<PB N="xxii" REF="025050_0022_102D75C454842E98">
of the&s;e Mini&s;ters, and of the whole a&s;&s;em|bly. But when in a few minutes I came in, and took my place, what different countenances ap|peared in the congregation? All my friends were highly plea&s;ed, and the others were as much con|founded and di&s;appointed, at &s;eeing me come in &s;o chearfully and quickly, after they had made them|&s;elves &s;o &s;ure, that I would not come. But &s;ure|ly, I might have been looked upon with pity; alone to an&s;wer for my&s;elf, no one to &s;upport me; while my antagoni&s;ts were &s;even of the able&s;t Mi|ni&s;ters that could be obtained. I felt, however, that inward compo&s;ure, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having acted uprightly and &s;incerely in the whole affair, that even cau&s;ed my countenance to appear ea&s;y and chearful.</P>
<P>The vote was then publicly read, and I &s;tood up, and declared my readine&s;s to comply with what was required. The worthy gentleman who was cho&s;en to di&s;pute with me, then ro&s;e up, and &s;aid the&s;e words, 'I am not prepared to di&s;pute with <HI>Mr. Winche&s;ter,</HI> I have heard that he &s;ays, That it would take &s;ix weeks to canva&s;s all the argu|ments fairly on both &s;ides; and I &s;uppo&s;e he has been &s;tudying upon the &s;ubject for a week or more, and I have not &s;tudied it at all; and therefore I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed.'</P>
<P>When I found that he, and all the re&s;t wholly declined di&s;puting with me, I begged liberty to &s;peak for two hours upon my &s;entiments, and lay them fairly open, and the ground upon which I maintained them. But this was denied me; I then de&s;ired them to give me one hour for this purpo&s;e; but this was al&s;o refu&s;ed. One of the Mini&s;ters got up, and &s;aid, That their bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="xxiii" REF="025050_0023_102D7595C205F1C0">
was not to debate with me, but to a&s;k me, whe|ther I believed the <HI>Re&s;toration</HI> of bad men and angels, finally to a &s;tate of holine&s;s and happine&s;s, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But if they did not come to di&s;pute with me, why was the vote pa&s;&s;ed by their party, as well as by my friends, that I &s;hould di&s;pute with them? This &s;peaks for it&s;elf. The mini&s;ters in&s;i&s;ted upon putting the que&s;tion to me, Do you believe the doctrine of the <HI>Univer&s;al Re&s;toration?</HI> My friends objected to my an&s;wering the que&s;tion, unle&s;s I might be allowed to vindicate my &s;entiments. But I &s;aid, That I did not fear any u&s;e that could be made of my words; that I had always freely con|fe&s;&s;ed what my thoughts were, when a&s;ked; and therefore I told them, that I did heartily believe the <HI>General Re&s;toration,</HI> and was willing to defend it. The gentleman that was cho&s;en to di&s;pute with me, then a&s;ked me, whether I thought it &s;trange, con&s;idering my change of &s;entiments, that there &s;hould be &s;uch a noi&s;e and uproar made upon the occa&s;ion? &amp;c. I told him, That I did not think it &s;trange at all; and gave him a little hi&s;tory of the affair, and how the matter came abroad, through the treachery of &s;ome whom I had e&s;teemed as my friends; that when I mentioned it to them I was not fully per&s;uaded of it my&s;elf, and perhaps ne|ver might have been, if I had not been oppo&s;ed and threatened; that I never had intended to trou|ble the people with my &s;entiments, but was willing to live and die with them, if they could bear with me; but that I could not u&s;e &s;o much deceit, as to deny what I believed, when a&s;ked by any one; that I never had yet done &s;o, and by the grace of God never would, let the con&s;equences be what
<PB N="xxiv" REF="025050_0024_102D75C61AF94DD0">
they might. What I &s;aid was in the pre&s;ence of all my accu&s;ers, and none of them could contra|dict me, nor had aught to lay to my charge, ex|cept in this matter of the Go&s;pel of my Saviour. My di&s;cour&s;e took &s;uch an effect upon him, that he then publicly declared, that my behaviour in the whole affair had been as became a <HI>man</HI> and a <HI>chri&s;tian,</HI> and that no one could accu&s;e me of any improper conduct. I &s;tood &s;ometime, and as none appeared to have any thing farther to &s;ay to me, I took my leave, and went out. He accompanied me to the door, and told me that he would write to me upon the &s;ubject; but whatever was the rea&s;on, he never did, nor have we &s;poken together &s;ince.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters then advi&s;ed the people to get an|other Mini&s;ter; but my friends being numerous, in&s;i&s;ted it &s;hould be fairly determined by the &s;ub|&s;cribers at large; but this the other party would not agree to. Several very fair offers were made by my friends to them, but they refu&s;ed them all; and finally, by force they kept us out of the hou&s;e, and deprived us of our part of the property, which was at la&s;t confirmed to them by law, though I think unju&s;tly, as we were the majority at fir&s;t; but they took uncommon pains in carrying about a <HI>prote&s;t</HI> again&s;t me, to every member of the church, both in the city and in the country, and threaten|ing all with excommunication who would not &s;ign it; by which &s;ome were intimidated, and by the&s;e and other means they &s;trengthened their party. But on the other hand, I took no pains, either to pro&s;elyte people to believe my &s;entiments or to make my party &s;trong. But I believe near an hundred of the members &s;uffered them&s;elves to be excom|municated
<PB N="xxv" REF="025050_0025_102D759819918840">
rather than to &s;ign the <HI>prote&s;t</HI> again&s;t me, and the doctrine that I preached. When we were deprived of our hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, the <HI>tru&s;tees</HI> of the <HI>Univer&s;ity</HI> gave us the liberty of their hall, where we quietly wor&s;hipped God for about four years, until we purcha&s;ed a place for our&s;elves. But to return. After this meeting of the Mini&s;|ters, the whole affair was open, and I found my|&s;elf obliged to vindicate the doctrine which they had condemned unheard, not only in private, but in the pulpit. Accordingly, on the 22d day of April, I preached a &s;ermon on Gen. iii. 15. in which I openly a&s;&s;erted the doctrine of the <HI>Final</HI> and <HI>Univer&s;al Re&s;toration</HI> of all fallen intelligences. This was publi&s;hed by particular de&s;ire, with a li&s;t of the plaine&s;t Scripture pa&s;&s;ages in favour of the doctrine; and a number of the mo&s;t common and principal objections, fairly &s;tated, and an&s;wered. This was my fir&s;t appearance in the world as a <HI>pro&s;e</HI> writer, which was what I never expected to be, and probably &s;hould never have been but for this occa&s;ion; &s;till le&s;s a writer of controver&s;y, to which I had naturally a great aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>After I had preached this &s;ermon, I had the <HI>Chevalier Ram&s;ey's Philo&s;ophical Principles of Natu|ral and Revealed Religion</HI> put into my hands; I read the &s;ame with great plea&s;ure and advantage, and I mu&s;t acknowledge it to be a work of great merit, and I have rea&s;on to ble&s;s God that ever I had opportunity of reading it. I can heartily re|commend it, as one of the be&s;t works in our lan|guage; and I mu&s;t &s;ay, that in mo&s;t things I fully agree with that very intelligent author. On the fourth day of January 1782, I preached the &s;er|mon called, <HI>The Outca&s;ts Comforted;</HI> from I&s;aiah
<PB N="xxvi" REF="025050_0026_102D75C8206C52D0">
lxvi. 5. to my friends who had been ca&s;t out, and excommunicated, for believing this glorious doc|trine. This was &s;oon after printed, and the next year it was republi&s;hed in <HI>London,</HI> by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Richard Clark,</HI> and was the fir&s;t of my works ever printed here.</P>
<P>I have thus given a brief, plain, and &s;imple ac|count of the means that have brought me to think and write in the manner that I have done, and which account may be con&s;idered as an hi&s;torical &s;ketch of nearly four years of my life.</P>
<P>I have every year &s;ince printed and publi&s;hed &s;omething, which I judged might be u&s;eful to my fellow-creatures; but as my works are in the hands of mo&s;t of my friends, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to give a particular account of any of them here, except this book of <HI>Dialogues on the Univer&s;al Re&s;toration.</HI> I have had many di&s;cour&s;es with various per&s;ons upon this &s;ubject, and many objections have been propo&s;ed to me, which I have endeavoured to an|&s;wer; and I can truly &s;ay, that the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, their que&s;tions, and my an&s;wers, their objections, and my &s;olutions, form the bulk of the&s;e Dialogues. I have endeavoured to give all the po&s;&s;ible force to their objections, and if any of them are weak, I can a&s;&s;ure the Public, that I have not made them &s;o (as &s;ome have in&s;inuated) merely that I might be able to an&s;wer them, but the weake&s;t of them have been propo&s;ed to me, and I have fairly &s;et down the mo&s;t powerful that I ever heard, gene|rally in the very words in which they were ad|dre&s;&s;ed to me, whether in conver&s;ation, or by let|ter; and I am willing if &s;tronger objections can be made, to put them in the place of tho&s;e which I have &s;et down, or add them to the number; and I

<P>'I AM per&s;uaded your knowledge of the world and its inhabitants, hath long &s;ince taught you to be familiar with the addre&s;&s;es of per&s;ons unknown to you; and I have formed that opinion of you, that your candour will admit, and your generous mind rejoice to hear, that a per&s;on, though unknown to you, is convinced that God hath gracious de&s;igns towards univer&s;al man.

<P>'I HOPE you will excu&s;e the freedom I have taken in writing to you.</P>
<P>'I have for &s;everal years embraced your &s;enti|ments, and have often &s;tood up in defence of them.</P>
<P>'I have frequently met with learned and can|did men, who have given me much &s;atisfaction in this important &s;ubject. When your Dialogues were publi&s;hed, I procured and read them with the greate&s;t avidity. I found the &s;ubject handled much to my mind. The &s;tronge&s;t objections rai&s;|ed
<PB N="xxx" REF="025050_0030_102D75CC1B4E5B40">
in all their weight and importance, and an&s;wered clearly and candidly. I read the book, over and over, with fre&s;h plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction. I &s;tudi|ed the arguments, trea&s;ured them up in my me|mory, and determined to become a defender of this part of truth. My heart burnt in love to God and mankind. I found exalted views of God, rai&s;ed exalted &s;trains of gratitude and prai&s;e. It was one of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t attracting views that ever I met with &s;ince I knew the Saviour's love. I &s;oon entered the field, and was obliged to prove my armour again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t objec|tions, backed with prejudices almo&s;t of an invin|cible nature. When I was hard put to it, I had recour&s;e to your Magazine, and from thence brought forth new pieces of artillery. You will ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e I had many trials from per&s;ons of different di&s;po&s;itions. By per&s;uading &s;everal of my acquaintance, Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, to read over your book, I became an in&s;trument of winning them over to the truth.</P>
<P>'One of my brethren in the mini&s;try prote&s;ted much again&s;t our notions, and declared he would never believe them. Knowing him to be a &s;en&s;ible man, and one who might be wrought upon by the force of truth properly &s;tated, I u&s;ed &s;everal argu|ments to per&s;uade him to read the book. At length he con&s;ented, and &s;aid, that he would do it to oblige me, but was determined not to believe it. I told him, it would &s;atisfy me for him to give it a candid reading.</P>
<P>'When we met again, I began to enquire what he thought of the book. He pau&s;ed a little, and then freely acknowledged the effect that it had had upon him&mdash;He frankly declared that his re&s;o|tion
<PB N="xxxi" REF="025050_0031_102D759D2AA03F28">
was ju&s;t the &s;ame, as though he had re&s;olved to look up to the Heavens when the &s;un &s;hone at noon, and not to believe that it &s;hone. I have &s;ecretly engaged &s;everal, and find when they are &s;en&s;ible, candid men, they fall in with your &s;enti|ments at once.</P>
<P>'I am acquainted with about half a &s;core Mi|ni&s;ters, who firmly believe and heartily embrace the doctrine; be&s;ides many private chri&s;tians of different denominations. Mo&s;t of us Mini&s;ters, who fall in with your &s;entiments, are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">raid of confe&s;&s;ing them publicly, for this rea&s;on, our peo|ple would thru&s;t us out of the &s;ynagogues, and we and our families might &s;uffer thereby. For my own part, I am determined to &s;tand by this truth, whether I can continue my place among the people where I am or not. Rather than give up this (through grace) I would give up life.</P>
<P>'I have &s;o much zea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in my heart for the con|firmation and e&s;tabli&s;hment of this truth, that I would, were it in my power, gladly pro&s;elyte all men to embrace and enjoy the benefit of it.</P>
<P>'I hope you will mu&s;ter up all your re&s;olution, and &s;tand forth boldly again in vindication of the cau&s;e of truth, and the mo&s;t glorious and mo&s;t ne|glected part of that truth that all men ought to embrace.

<SALUTE>'REV. AND DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'AN anxious de&s;ire of a more intimate acquaintance with you induces me to take this li|berty of writing to you, hoping you will excu&s;e my freedom; undoubtedly it will appear &s;trange, that one you never &s;aw nor heard of, &s;hould take &s;uch liberty. But as a foe to flattery, I ju&s;t give you this &s;hort account of my fir&s;t know|ledge of you; which was only by the hearing of the ear.</P>
<P>'Something more than a year ago, I was told that there was a preacher ju&s;t come to <HI>London, an American</HI> by birth, who had undertaken to preach an <HI>Univer&s;al Re&s;toration</HI> to lo&s;t &s;ouls. As it was new to me, I was much &s;urpri&s;ed at this &s;trange account, and I thought and &s;aid, (though with &s;ome degree of candour) that I looked upon it to be &s;ome one that could not dig, and was a&s;hamed to beg, &s;o to procure a living he had written this book. Here I re&s;ted for &s;ome time, thinking that much hurt would be done thereby; till the la&s;t time I &s;aw Mr. <HI>Atkins,</HI> (who I under&s;tand is now in connection with you) he gave me &s;ome further
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="025050_0033_102D759FAE6F7380">
account of you and your doctrine. But I could not under&s;tand it from his account; yet he per&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould believe it, if I was to read your <HI>Dialogues.</HI> I told him I would give them a fair reading, if I could &s;ee them. Still I entertained the &s;ame &s;trange idea as before. The next account I had was from a young man of <HI>Berkhamp&s;tead,</HI> who came to &s;ee me, and in our di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;aid, 'Some of your people have imbibed a new doctrine, I hear.' He &s;aid, 'Yes, and I verily believe it a truth.' I was now more &s;urpri&s;ed than before; but he &s;aid, if I was to &s;ee it he had no doubt but I &s;hould believe it al&s;o. 'Well,' &s;aid I 'if I could &s;ee the book I would lay prejudice a&s;ide, and give it a fair read|ing, let it be what it may.' He very kindly told me, that as &s;oon as he could get it home, (for he had lent it to a friend) he would &s;end it to me. I thanked him, and promi&s;ed to read it impartially, knowing that where party &s;pirit reigns, blindne&s;s takes place.</P>
<P>'According to promi&s;e, he &s;ent the book: and as I had done before, I now laid the matter before the Lord, with this petition, that he would not &s;uffer me to be mi&s;led, or wander out of the way, as I knew that he knew my de&s;ire and intention. I was delivered from fear, and with candour and confidence I began to read my new book, and to my great a&s;toni&s;hment, yet to my greater joy, I found what I had many times wi&s;hed for &s;ecretly in my heart, namely, the po&s;&s;ibility of a relea&s;e for tho&s;e poor &s;ufferers, and not only &s;o, but like|wi&s;e the certainty of it; for as I read on, I could not but &s;ee, that it was the determination of JE|HOVAH to make all men, as his creatures, happy in him&s;elf. O with what eyes did I now view the
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="025050_0034_102D75CFA4EF1FB8">
Deity, and what ideas did I entertain of him to what I had ever done before! (though I was on the general plan) O how my &s;oul was filled with love! what gratitude did I feel to that God, who I now &s;aw &s;o loved all his creatures, as to give his only Son to die, with a pure de&s;ign to glorify him|&s;elf in the &s;alvation of every &s;oul! I now &s;aw him a God of love indeed, but it is out of my power to tell fully the happy effect it had, and has now up|on my mind; but it is &s;omething like what I expe|rienced, when the Lord fir&s;t &s;et my &s;oul at liberty; as I was then &s;wallowed up, as in the vi&s;ion of God. But the bigne&s;s of this &s;heet is not &s;uffici|ent to tell you all I could wi&s;h, but I tru&s;t I &s;hall &s;ee you in per&s;on, as I &s;hould e&s;teem it a privilege indeed to hear you preach, and to conver&s;e with you, and I fully intended coming to <HI>London</HI> about la&s;t May, on purpo&s;e, but as I had already a large family which, through the ble&s;sing of God, I main|tain with my labour; finding it likely to increa&s;e, I could not well &s;pare time to come, or I had been with you at that &s;ea&s;on, as I had nothing el&s;e in my way to hinder. Mr. <HI>John Holder,</HI> of <HI>Tring,</HI> an acquaintance of mine, has lent me a few little tracts of yours, which I am now reading with plea&s;ure and profit, and he has kindly offer|ed him&s;elf to accompany me at any time that I &s;hall appoint to come and &s;ee you, but the &s;ame difficulty is now in the way as before. If ever Providence &s;hould open a way, I &s;hall gladly em|brace the opportunity. Though I have no doubt of the truth of the doctrine of the Re&s;toration, as to my&s;elf, I have never &s;poke of it in public as yet, not knowing whether that may be the be&s;t way to make this glorious &s;alvation known; but I
<PB N="xxxv" REF="025050_0035_102D75A143872AF0">
have &s;poke to &s;everal of the people in private, tho&s;e whom I judged to have the be&s;t under&s;tanding, and the mo&s;t candour; and mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;eem to be glad at the news, and my own wife in particu|lar embraces it with all thankfulne&s;s, and joins with me in love to you and yours. (Though very ill at this time.) If it will not be attended with too much trouble, plea&s;e to &s;end me your <HI>Dia|logues,</HI> bound, by the <HI>Ayle&s;bury</HI> &s;tage coach. I have given the coachman an order to pay the ex|pence. As I &s;tand like your&s;elf (in this re&s;pect) unconnected with any party, (though I was with Mr. <HI>We&s;ley's</HI> people twelve years,) I am now free, I tru&s;t from bigotry and prejudice, open to con|viction, and willing for in&s;truction.

<ITEM>OBJECTION.&mdash;That the words <HI>everla&s;t|ing, eternal, &amp;c.</HI> are applied to the puni&s;h|ment of the wicked 2</ITEM>
<ITEM>An&s;wer.&mdash;The&s;e words are but &s;eldom appli|ed to the mi&s;ery of the wicked; being con|nected therewith only twice in the Old Te&s;tament, and but &s;ix times in the New; and are full as often connected with things and times that certainly have had, or will have an end, as they are with the mi&s;ery of the wicked; which cannot therefore be certainly inferred from tho&s;e w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds being applied to it. The word <HI>forever,</HI> from which the word <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> is derived, is frequently u&s;ed in a limited &s;en&s;e; more than fifty pa&s;sages of Scripture referred to where it is evidently u&s;ed in that manner 4 5 9</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.&mdash;But the words <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> are applied to the mi&s;ery of the wicked; three in&s;tances of which are produced, which are all that can be found 10</ITEM>
<ITEM>An&s;wer.&mdash;This is a very &s;trong phra&s;e, and would be judged unan&s;werable, but for certain con&s;iderations. 10</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 If the phra&s;e <HI>forever and ever</HI> intends any pe|riod or periods longer than the word <HI>forever,</HI> then there mu&s;t be a proportion, and con&s;equently both mu&s;t be limited 11</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="xxxviii" REF="025050_0038_102D75D3C5126E70">
2 This phra&s;e as applied to future mi&s;ery can|not intend <HI>endle&s;s duration,</HI> &s;ince a time will come, when death, pain, and &s;or|row &s;hall be no more Page. 11</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It is more than probable that the lake of fire, in which the wicked will be pu|ni&s;hed with the &s;econd death, will be the earth di&s;&s;olved by the general con|flagration; and that the new earth will be formed out of the &s;ame ma&s;s, and con&s;equently the lake of fire &s;hall at la&s;t be no more Page. 12</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. There will come a total ce&s;&s;ation of night Page. 12</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The &s;ame words are u&s;ed full as often, if not oftener, for periods that mu&s;t come to an end, as they are for the ages of future mi&s;ery Page. 13</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Unle&s;s we allow this phra&s;e, however &s;trong, to intend ages and periods, we &s;hould &s;et the Scripture at variance with it&s;elf, neither would it be po&s;&s;ible to re|concile &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages that are men|tioned Page. 14</ITEM>

<ITEM>An&s;wer.&mdash;The word <HI>forever</HI> applied to &s;piri|tual things, and circum&s;tances of ano|ther &s;tate mu&s;t not be always under&s;tood to mean <HI>endle&s;s</HI> Page. 15</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.&mdash;But does not the phra&s;e <HI>forever and ever,</HI> in the New Te&s;tament always in|tend <HI>endle&s;s?</HI> Page. 16</ITEM>
<ITEM>An&s;wer.&mdash;It doth not. An undeniable in|&s;tance
<PB N="xxxix" REF="025050_0039_102D75A4CF7D8BB0">
brought in proof, to which &s;everal more might have been added Page. 16</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.&mdash;But is not the Scripture chargea|able with a de&s;ign to mi&s;lead men in the&s;e words when applied to future mi&s;ery, un|le&s;s they intend <HI>endle&s;s duration?</HI> and does the limiting the&s;e words accu&s;e Chri&s;t of duplicity and deceit in his threatenings? Page. 16</ITEM>
<ITEM>This an&s;wered, by &s;hewing that the Jews might make the &s;ame objection again&s;t the whole &s;y&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity, which puts an end to the di&s;pen&s;ation which is talled <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> Page. 17</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Hebrew word rendered <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> properly intends a <HI>hidden duration,</HI> or period, but not <HI>endle&s;s</HI> Page. 17</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.&mdash;The &s;ame word <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> or <HI>e|ternal</HI> is in the very &s;ame ver&s;e applied both to the mi&s;ery of the wicked and to the hap|pine&s;s of the righteous Page. 19</ITEM>
<ITEM>An&s;wer.&mdash;The very &s;ame word is in other places applied to very different things, and who&s;e natures and durations are entirely di&s;&s;imilar Page. 20</ITEM>
<ITEM>The kingdom given by the Father to Chri&s;t &s;hall end, and &s;o al&s;o the kingdom giv|en by Chri&s;t to his &s;aints &s;hall end; but this &s;hall not dimini&s;h the glory of Chri&s;t, nor endanger the happine&s;s of the &s;aints. If the kingdom of Chri&s;t and his &s;aints &s;hall end, then certainly much more the kingdom of Satan Page. 21</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.&mdash;But upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that the doctrine of <HI>endle&s;s damnation</HI> was true, in what manner might one expect it to be
<PB N="xl" REF="025050_0040_102D75D58D250550">
expre&s;t in the Bible? Page. 22</ITEM>
<ITEM>An&s;wer.&mdash;If it was true, there could be no promi&s;es, intimations, or even di&s;tant hints to the contrary. And it is therefore &s;hewn to be fal&s;e by a number of po&s;itive proofs. If there were not promi&s;es and intimations of the <HI>General Re&s;toration</HI> in the Scripture, the doctrine of <HI>endle&s;s damnation</HI> might be then concluded to be true, however dark; but the <HI>endle&s;s happine&s;s</HI> of the righteous is &s;et forth in much &s;tronger language, and with more abundant force of expre&s;&s;ion. As for in&s;tance, St. John, who never applies the word <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> once in all his writings to the mi&s;ery of the wicked, u&s;es the word far oftener in his Go&s;pel alone, as connected with the happine&s;s of the righteous, than it is u&s;ed in the whole Bible to expre&s;s the mi&s;ery of the wicked.

<ITEM>An&s;wer.&mdash;This objection is entirely ground|le&s;s; for, though in one place he prays ex|clu&s;ively for his apo&s;tles, yet a little after he prays for all that &s;hould believe on him, through their word; and, finally, that the world might come to believe and know that he was the true Me&s;&s;iah; which &s;hall be the ca&s;e when all believers &s;hall be <HI>one,</HI> as the Father and Son are <HI>one</HI> Page. 100</ITEM>

Fourthly, It is proved, That the doctrine of the Re&s;toration is according to god|line&s;s, becau&s;e the belief of it tends to fill our hearts with all amiable tempers; as humility, meekne&s;s, univer&s;al benevo|lence, &amp;c. and is calculated to de&s;troy &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, envy, pride, malice, rage, &amp;c.

<ITEM>Fifthly, The doctrine of the Re&s;toration is vindicated from the charge of licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, by an appeal to facts, e&s;pecially by the amiable conduct of the <HI>Tunkers</HI> or German Bapti&s;ts, in America, who univer&s;ally hold the&s;e &s;entiments Page. 123</ITEM>

<ITEM>An&s;wered.&mdash;1. By &s;hewing that God doth not always lay the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible re&s;traint upon &s;in Page. 129</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The idea of limited puni&s;hment by ap|pearing more ju&s;t and rea&s;onable to the mind, is more calculated to re&s;train &s;in and iniquity than the doctrine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery Page. 130</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That, in fact, though the greater part have profe&s;&s;ed to believe endle&s;s damna|nation, yet their belief appears not to have much re&s;trained them from &s;in, Page. 131</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The great number of heathen people that die without ever hearing the Go&s;pel, in|fants, ideots, per&s;ons born deaf, &amp;c. ren|der

it probable that many are reclaimed in a future &s;tate Page. 132</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the intention of God is not &s;o much to re&s;train &s;in, as to &s;hew its enormity; and, finally, to de&s;troy it out of the u|niver&s;e Page. 132</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. If the doctrine of the Re&s;toration &s;hould be abu&s;ed, that can be no argument a|gain&s;t it, as the Go&s;pel it&s;elf has been perverted, yet is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing to mankind Page. 132</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore it is evident that this glorious doctrine cannot ju&s;tly be charged with the lea&s;t tendency towards licentiou&s;ne&s;s Page. 133</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.&mdash;It would not be prudent in God, even if he intended finally to re&s;tore the wicked, to let them know his gracious de|&s;igns before hand; it is time enough to let them know his gracious purpo&s;es towards them, when his former threatenings have failed of their effect, but not before Page. 133</ITEM>
<ITEM>An&s;wered.&mdash;God has thought it the abound|ing of his wi&s;dom and prudence to make known to his &s;aints this my&s;tery of his will, even his purpo&s;e to rehead all things in Chri&s;t.

<ITEM>An&s;wer.&mdash; The fir&s;t part of this objection re|&s;pects only the &s;tate of the body in the grave, but cannot be brought to di&s;prove the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;oul in the &s;eparate &s;tate, the re&s;urrection of the body, a fu|ture &s;tate of exi&s;tence, or the final Re&s;tora|tion Page. 168</ITEM>
<ITEM>The &s;econd part of this objection has not the lea&s;t relation to the &s;ubject; but be|longs to quite another matter. But if it related to the death of the body, (as it does not) it would be no real objection to the Re&s;toration Page. 169 171</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.&mdash;The living have hope, but the dead have none, their love, hatred, envy, &amp;c. are peri&s;hed Page. 172</ITEM>

and we ought to be &s;o in our labours on earth, to which death will put an end.

<ITEM>4.

<ITEM>5. God threatens to puni&s;h &s;inners for all their &s;ins; and to render their &s;in and iniquity double upon them; and yet promi&s;es to be gracious to them after all: which would be impo&s;&s;ible if every &s;in was infinite, and could not be fully pu|ni&s;hed with any puni&s;hment &s;hort of endle&s;s mi&s;ery Page. 211</ITEM>

<P>I HAVE taken the freedom to call upon you, to have a little di&s;cour&s;e with you concerning the doctrine of <HI>the Re&s;toration of all Things,</HI> which it is &s;aid you believe; and to pro|po&s;e &s;ome objections.</P>

<P>I am happy to &s;ee you, and am wil|ling to di&s;cour&s;e, as well as I am able, upon any &s;ubject that may be agreeable; but I have always made it a rule never to pre&s;s the belief of my &s;en|timents upon my friends; and I can &s;afely &s;ay, that, though &s;uch great pains have been taken by my adver&s;aries to prejudice people again&s;t me, I have never gone about from hou&s;e to hou&s;e to propagate my opinions; and I make it an univer&s;al rule not

<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t of all bring to view that grand objection, which is formed from the word <HI>eternal</HI> or <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> being applied to a future &s;tate of puni&s;hment; as in the following pa&s;&s;ages: I&s;aiah xxxiii. 14. 'The &s;inners in Zion are afraid, fearfulne&s;s hath &s;urprized the hypocrites. Who among us &s;hall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us &s;hall dwell with <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> burn|ings?</P>
<P>Dan. xii. 2. 'And many of them that &s;leep in the du&s;t of the earth &s;hall awake, &s;ome to <HI>everla&s;t|ing</HI> life, and &s;ome to &s;hame and <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> con|tempt.'</P>
<P>St. Matt. xviii. 8. 'Wherefore, if thine hand or thy foot offend thee (or cau&s;e thee to offend) cut them off, and ca&s;t them from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands, or two feet, to be ca&s;t into <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> fire.'</P>
<P>St. Matt. xxv. 41. 'Then &s;hall he &s;ay al&s;o unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cur&s;|ed, into <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.' Ver&s;e 46, 'The&s;e &s;hall go away into <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> puni&s;hment: but the righteous in|to life <HI>eternal,</HI> or <HI>everla&s;ting,'</HI>&mdash;The &s;ame word in the original being u&s;ed for both, though varied by the tran&s;lators.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="025050_0059_102D761618C9DEF8">
St. Mark, iii. 29. 'But he that &s;hall bla&s;|pheme again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, hath never for|givene&s;s; but is in danger of <HI>eternal</HI> damna|tion.'</P>
<P>2 The&s;. i. 7, 8, 9. 'The Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> de&s;truction, from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.'</P>
<P>Jude, 6, 7. 'And the Angels which kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate, but left their own habitation, he hath re&s;erved in <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> chains under darkne&s;s, unto the judgment of the great day: Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving them&s;elves over unto for|nication, and going after &s;trange fle&s;h, are &s;et forth for an example, &s;uffering the vengeance of <HI>eternal</HI> fire.'</P>
<P>The&s;e texts, together, form &s;uch an objection to the doctrine of the Re&s;toration, that I can by no means believe it, unle&s;s this can be fairly an&s;wer|ed, and proofs brought from the Scriptures to &s;hew, that the words <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> and <HI>eternal,</HI> (which are tran&s;lations of the &s;ame word and &s;ynonimous) being connected with the puni&s;hment of the wicked, and their future mi&s;ery, do not nece&s;|&s;arily imply the continuance of the &s;ame while God exi&s;ts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad that you have &s;o fairly and fully &s;tated the matter; and I highly commend your re&s;olution, not to believe the <HI>univer&s;al doc|trine,</HI> unle&s;s this can be an&s;wered fully, without any torturing or twi&s;ting the Scriptures; and if I
<PB N="4" REF="025050_0060_102D75E80CAA7E20">
am not able, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to remove this difficulty, I will publicly recant my &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>But, before I come to give a direct an&s;wer, I would beg leave to remark how very &s;eldom this word is u&s;ed to expre&s;s the duration of puni&s;hment. We &s;hould think, by &s;ome &s;ermons we hear, that <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> is applied to mi&s;ery in every book of the New Te&s;tament, if not in every chapter. A friend of mine told me, that he was once preaching in Maryland, and after &s;ermon a man came and a&s;ked him, of what denomination he was? To which he an&s;wered, A Bapti&s;t. I think, &s;ays the man, that you do not preach up &s;o much <HI>everla&s;ting damnation,</HI> as the Bapti&s;ts and Methodi&s;ts, among us, do. To which my friend replied, <HI>Everla&s;ting damnation</HI> is found in the Scripture. True, an&s;wered the man; but &s;ome preachers give us more of it in one &s;er|mon than is to be found in the whole Bible. The truth of this remark will appear, if we con&s;ider that St. Luke, never u&s;es the word <HI>aionion,</HI> or <HI>everla&s;t|ing,</HI> as connected with the mi&s;ery of the wicked, in his go&s;pel; nor St. Mark but once, and then in a particular ca&s;e only: In the go&s;pel of St. John, it is not to be found at all, in that connection, nor in any of his epi&s;tles: In the account of the preaching of the apo&s;tles through the world, in the fir&s;t age of Chri&s;tianity, we do not find it men|tioned, in that light, &s;o much as once: No, not in all the &s;ermons, and parts of &s;ermons, which St. Luke has pre&s;erved in the Book of the Acts: though the doctrine of <HI>everla&s;ting damnation</HI> is the &s;ub&s;tance of many modern di&s;cour&s;es. St. Paul never mentions <HI>everla&s;ting de&s;traction</HI> but once, though his writings form &s;uch a con&s;iderable part
<PB N="5" REF="025050_0061_102D7617B319B5F8">
of the New Te&s;tament. Neither are &s;uch words found in the epi&s;tle of St. James, or in tho&s;e of St. Peter; and but three times in the go&s;pel of St. Matthew: And only twice in all the Old Te&s;ta|ment. But was the word <HI>aionion</HI> applied to mi&s;ery but once, in the whole Bible, it would de&s;erve a &s;erious con&s;ideration; and unle&s;s the force of it can be removed by the authority of Scripture, it mu&s;t remain an unan&s;werable objection. But I &s;hall proceed to an&s;wer it, by bringing an equal number of pa&s;&s;ages where the word <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> is applied to <HI>things</HI> and <HI>times,</HI> that have had, or mu&s;t have, an end. As in the following pa&s;&s;ages: Gen. xvii. 7, 8. 'And I will e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant between me and thee, and thy &s;eed after thee, in their ge|nerations, for an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> covenant; to be a God unto thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee, the land wherein thou art a &s;tranger, all the land of Canaan, for an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and I will be their God.' Ver&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3. 'He that is born in thy hou&s;e, and bought with thy mo|ney, mu&s;t needs be circumci&s;ed: and my cove|nant &s;hall be in your fle&s;h for an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> cove|nant.'</P>
<P>Here note, that the land of Canaan is called an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and the covenant of cir|cumci&s;ion in their fle&s;h, an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> covenant, though it is certain that the land of Canaan, as well as the other parts of the earth mu&s;t be di&s;|&s;olved or melted, in the general confl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gration; and <HI>circumci&s;ion</HI> is now declared null and void by the Holy Gho&s;t; and the ceremony cannot endure to endle&s;s ages.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="025050_0062_102D75E9AE0DFE48">
Of the &s;ame kind are the following pa&s;&s;ages: Gen. xlviii. 3, 4. 'And Jacob &s;aid unto Jo&s;eph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz, in the land of Canaan, and ble&s;&s;ed me; and &s;aid unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and mul|tiply thee, and I will make of thee a multi|tude of people: and will give this land to thy &s;eed after thee, for an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.' And in the ble&s;&s;ing of Jo&s;eph, he &s;ays, 'The ble&s;&s;ings of thy father have prevailed above the ble&s;&s;ings of my progenitors, up to the utmo&s;t bound of the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> hills.' By which, I &s;uppo&s;e, the hills of the land of Canaan were meant.</P>
<P>God &s;aith to Mo&s;es, Exod. xl. 15. 'And thou &s;halt anoint them (Aaron's &s;ons) as thou did&s;t anoint their father, that they may mini&s;ter unto me in the prie&s;t's office: for their anointing &s;hall &s;urely be an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> prie&s;thood, throughout their generations.' Lev. xvi. 34. 'And this &s;hall be an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> &s;tatute unto you, to make an atonement for the Children of I&s;rael, for all their &s;ins, once a year; and he did as JEHO|VAH commanded Mo&s;es.'</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle declares, that the&s;e <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> ordi|nances were only <HI>till the time of reformation,</HI> Heb. ix. 10. And this <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> prie&s;thood of Aaron's &s;ons has cea&s;ed long ago: 'For the prie&s;thood being changed, (by Chri&s;t) there is, of nece&s;|&s;ity a change al&s;o of the law: For he of whom the&s;e things are &s;poken, pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar: For it is evident, that our Lord &s;prang out of Judah; of which tribe Mo&s;es &s;pake no|thing concerning prie&s;thood. And it is yet far
<PB N="7" REF="025050_0063_102D7619AE859778">
more evident: For that, after the &s;imilitude of Melchi&s;edec, there ari&s;eth another prie&s;t, who is made not after the law of a carnal command|ment, but after the power of an endle&s;s life: For he te&s;tifieth, Thou art a prie&s;t for ever, after the order of Melchi&s;edec: For there is verily a di&s;|annulling of the commandment going before for the weakne&s;s and unprofitablene&s;s thereof.' Heb. vii. 12&mdash;18. The whole &s;um of the apo&s;tle's argument, in this epi&s;tle, tends to prove, that the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> ordinance is now no more; and the <HI>ever|la&s;ting</HI> prie&s;thood of Aaron and his &s;ons, is now aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Another pa&s;&s;age where the word <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> is evidently u&s;ed in a limited &s;en&s;e, is, Numb xxv. 11, 12, 13. where we read thus: 'Phinehas, the &s;on of Eleazar, the &s;on of Aaron the prie&s;t, hath turned my wrath away from the Children of I&s;|rael while he was zealous for my &s;ake among them, that I con&s;umed not the Children of I&s;rael in my jealou&s;y. Wherefore &s;ay, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: And he &s;hall have it, and his &s;eed after him, even the cove|nant of an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> prie&s;thood; becau&s;e he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the Children of I&s;rael.'</P>
<P>If the word <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> intends <HI>endle&s;s duration,</HI> how &s;hould we be able to reconcile this promi&s;e with the total ce&s;&s;ation of the Levitical prie&s;thood? As for the family of Phinehas, with whom this covenant of an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> prie&s;thood was made, it was entirely deprived of the benefit of the &s;ame, within the &s;pace of four hundred years: For when the &s;ons of Eli tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the covenant, by pro|faning it, God &s;ent him word, that as they had
<PB N="8" REF="025050_0064_102D75EBAD748150">
broken it on their parts, it was entirely, and to all intents and purpo&s;es di&s;&s;olved. Read 1 Sam. ii. from the beginning of the 12th ver&s;e to the end of the 17th, and from the 27th ver&s;e to the end of chapter: And al&s;o, chap. iii. 11, 12, 13, 14.</P>
<P>I will tran&s;cribe ver&s;e 30, of the &s;econd chapter, in proof of my point. 'Wherefore, JEHOVAH, God of I&s;rael, &s;aith, I &s;aid, indeed, that thy hou&s;e, and the hou&s;e of thy father, &s;hould walk before me <HI>for ever:</HI> But now JEHOVAH &s;aith, Be it far from me, for them that honour me, I will honour; and they that de&s;pi&s;e me, &s;hall be light|ly e&s;teemed.' Hophni, and Phinehas, were &s;oon after &s;lain in one day; and Saul, the king of I&s;rael, &s;ent Doeg, the Edomite, who fell upon the prie&s;ts, and &s;lew four&s;core and five per&s;ons, who wore a linen ephod, in one day. 'And Nob, the city of the prie&s;ts, &s;mote he with the edge of the &s;word; both men, and women, and children, and &s;uck|lings, and oxen, and a&s;&s;es, and &s;heep, with the edge of the &s;word.' 1 Sam. xxii. 19. The whole hou&s;e of Phinehas &s;eems to have been de&s;troyed at this time, except Abiathar; and when Solomon came to the throne, he thru&s;t him out from being prie&s;t, 'that he might fulfil the word of JEHO|VAH, which he &s;pake concerning the hou&s;e of Eli, in Shiloh,' 1 Kings, ii. 27. From this time, the hou&s;e of Ithamar had the prie&s;thood.</P>
<P>It is &s;o evident that the word which is tran&s;lated <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> cannot in the nature of things, ab&s;o|lutely &s;ignify, <HI>without end,</HI> that I &s;hould not think it worth while to quote any more pa&s;&s;ages in proof of its intending <HI>age,</HI> or <HI>ages,</HI> only, were it not con|&s;tantly u&s;ed as a great objection again&s;t the uni+ver&s;al Re&s;tora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion: I &s;hall, therefore, in&s;tance two

or three more in particular, in this place, and re|fer to a great number of others, of the &s;ame kind; all tending to prove the &s;ame thing. Hab. iii. 6. 'The <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> mountains were &s;cattered, the <HI>perpetual</HI> hills did bow.' The go&s;pel is called, the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> go&s;pel,' Rev. xiv. 6. yet it mu&s;t cea&s;e to be preached, when it &s;hall be needed no longer. Jonah &s;aith, 'The earth with her bars was about me, <HI>for ever:</HI> yet ha&s;t thou brought up my life from corruption, O JEHOVAH, my God.' Jonah, ii. 6. But it would be the highe&s;t ab&s;urdity upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that the word <HI>Legnolam,</HI> here rendered, <HI>for ever,</HI> properly &s;ignifies <HI>without end,</HI> for him to &s;ay, that his life was brought up from corruption; and, therefore, we know that he could not u&s;e it in that &s;en&s;e, be|cau&s;e, on the third day, he was delivered from his dreadful pri&s;on. There is no doubt but the time that he was there, &s;eemed an age, and, while he was thus &s;hut up, there was no intermi&s;&s;ion to the darkne&s;s, and di&s;tre&s;s, that overwhelmed him; and, therefore he might &s;ay, with propriety, that the earth, with her bars, was about him, for ever,' (i. e. <HI>perpetually without ce&s;&s;ation</HI>) during the period he remained in the fi&s;h's belly; which appeared to him, as a long age indeed. But, as it would be a work of much time and labour to mention all the pa&s;&s;ages where the word tran&s;lated <HI>for ever,</HI> evidently intends only an age, or period, I &s;hall ju&s;t direct you to the following; which you may look over at your lei&s;ure.</P>

I&s;aiah lxv. 17. lxvi. 22. more than intimates, that the new heaven and earth &s;hall be created out of the &s;ub&s;tance of the old, di&s;&s;olved by the fire; that the <HI>new earth</HI> &s;hall no more have a <HI>&s;ea</HI> therein, &s;eems to imply, that in its former &s;tate, it had a <HI>&s;ea,</HI> or why this expre&s;&s;ion, 'And there was no <HI>more</HI> &s;ea.'&mdash;Now, if this hy|pothe&s;is is right, the following will be the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e; <HI>viz.</HI></P>

The lake of fire is expre&s;sly declared to be 'the &s;econd death,' Rev. xx. 14. The earth, in its burnt, melted, and di&s;&s;olved &s;tate, will be the ge|neral lake of fire and brim&s;tone; according to the ver&s;es above cited from St. Peter.

<P><HI>4thly,</HI> The <HI>&s;moke</HI> of their torment is to a&s;cend up <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> and they are to be tormented day and night: But, as the &s;moke of the burning earth mu&s;t cea&s;e, when its &s;ub&s;tance is entirely di&s;&s;olved or melted, and all combu&s;tible bodies are con|&s;umed; and as it is intimated in Job xxvi. 10. that day and night &s;hall come to an end: and in Rev. xxi. 25. it is &s;aid of the New Jeru&s;alem, 'And the gates of it &s;hall not be &s;hut at all by day, for there &s;hall be no night there.' For all the&s;e rea&s;ons, I cannot be altogether per&s;uaded, that their being tormented <HI>day and night, for ever and ever,</HI> during which time the &s;moke of their tor|ment &s;hall con&s;tantly a&s;cend, is quite equal to <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery,</HI> e&s;pecially as there &s;hall come a time when <HI>death</HI> &s;hall be no more, <HI>pain</HI> &s;hall be no more, <HI>&s;orrow</HI> &s;hall be no more, <HI>&s;moke</HI> &s;hall probably a&s;cend no more, and, peradventure, <HI>night</HI> &s;hall be no more.</P>

<P>It is certain, that when the word <HI>for ever</HI> is applied to things of this life and world, it intends <HI>a period;</HI> but when applied to &s;piritual matters, and things of another world, it mu&s;t be <HI>endle&s;s,</HI> according to my judgment; and I am apt to think, you will find it &s;o too.</P>

<P>I am certain that you will &s;oon be convinced to the contrary.

me to know it. The &s;ame objection that you make again&s;t the Re&s;toration, the Jews make again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>his religion;</HI> for they argue thus: God is an unchangeable Being, and he declared, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that the ordinances of the Levitical di&s;pen&s;ation &s;hould be <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> and the anointing of Aaron's &s;ons &s;hould be an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> prie&s;thood, throughout their generations; (See Exod. xl. 15. and Lev. xvi. 34.) and, therefore, we mu&s;t reject the Me&s;&s;iah of the Chri&s;tians, as an impo&s;tor; ina&s;much, as he pretends to aboli&s;h tho&s;e &s;tatutes, which God hath called <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> and to &s;et him&s;elf up as a Prie&s;t, contrary to the expre&s;s promi&s;e of the LORD, who cannot lye, nor repent, that Aaron and his &s;ons &s;hould have an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> prie&s;thood; and, therefore, if this is the true Me&s;&s;iah, God meant to deceive us, when he pro|mi&s;ed the&s;e <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> ble&s;&s;ings, and privileges, which, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e were only <HI>for a time,</HI> if Chri&s;tianity be true; therefore, we reject it, as being incon&s;i&s;tent with the promi&s;es of God.</P>
<P>It is evident, from this view of the matter, that the Jews reject Chri&s;t and his religion, upon as good ground, as you reject the univer&s;al Re&s;tora|tion, and perhaps better; for you have nothing to plead again&s;t the Re&s;toration, but &s;ome threaten|ings of puni&s;hments, which are called <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> or <HI>eternal,</HI> in our tran&s;lation; but they plead ex|pre&s;s promi&s;es of the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> continuance of their church-&s;tate and wor&s;hip, in oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;tianity. But, if it be true, that both the He|brew and Greek words, which our tran&s;lators have rendered by the Engli&s;h word <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> do not intend <HI>endle&s;s duration,</HI> but, a <HI>hidden period,</HI> or <HI>periods;</HI> then the ground is changed at once, and
<PB N="18" REF="025050_0074_102D75F5478041F0">
the Jews have no right to object again&s;t Chri&s;tiani|ty, becau&s;e God, promi&s;ed a continuance of their temple wor&s;hip, for a <HI>certain age, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, hidden period;</HI> nor the Chri&s;tians to reject the univer&s;al Re&s;tora|tion, becau&s;e God hath threatened the rebellious with &s;uch dreadful puni&s;hments, which &s;hall en|dure through periods, expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame terms.

<P>Fairly &s;tated! And, if it be not as fairly an&s;wered, it &s;hall be looked upon as an in&s;u|perable difficulty. But, happily, there is a pa&s;|&s;age, in Hab. iii. 6. where the &s;ame word is u&s;ed for very different things; 'He &s;tood, and mea&s;ured the earth: he beheld, and drove a&s;under the na|tions; and the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> mountains were &s;cat|tered, the <HI>perpetual</HI> hills did bow: his ways are <HI>everla&s;ting.</HI>' In our tran&s;lation, the mountains, and the ways of God, are called <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> and the hills <HI>perpetual;</HI> but, in the original, the word <HI>gnad</HI> is applied to the mountains, and the word <HI>gnolam</HI> to the hills, and the ways of God. But whether we argue from the original, or from the tran&s;lation, it makes no difference: The que&s;tion is, Are the mountains, or the hills, <HI>eternal</HI> in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which the ways of God are? If &s;o, the earth mu&s;t have exi&s;ted <HI>coeval</HI> with the ways of JEHOVAH, and the hills, and mountains, mu&s;t never be removed, while his ways endure; and, as his ways can never be de&s;troyed, the ab&s;olute eternity, not of the earth only, but of its pre&s;ent form, its mountains and hills, mu&s;t be inferred: contrary to I&s;aiah xl. 4. xliv. 10&mdash;Ezek. xxxviii. 20.&mdash;2 Pet. iii. 7, 10, 11, 12.&mdash;Rev. xvi. 2c. xx.
<PB N="20" REF="025050_0076_102D75F6DB3604C8">
11.&mdash;Nay, even in this very text, the ways of God are &s;poken of as being of a 'different nature from the mountains, which were <HI>&s;cattered,</HI> and the hills, which did <HI>bow.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, no &s;olid argument can be drawn from the application of the &s;ame word to <HI>different</HI> things, to prove that they &s;hall be equal in their continu|ance, unle&s;s their nature be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Thus, in the <HI>Greek</HI> New Te&s;tament, in Rom. xvi. 25. we read of the my&s;tery which hath been kept &s;ecret, from <HI>Chronois aioniois,</HI> and, in the 26th ver&s;e, we find, that it is now made known by the commandment <HI>Tou aionion Theou.</HI> But mu&s;t it be argued that becau&s;e <HI>aioniois</HI> is applied to times, and <HI>aionion</HI> to God; therefore, <HI>times</HI> are as ancient as JEHOVAH, and mu&s;t continue while he exi&s;ts? The ab&s;urdity of this is too glaring. Our tran&s;lators have rendered <HI>Chronois aioniois, '&s;ince the word be|gan,'</HI> in&s;tead 'of <HI>eternal times;</HI>' and have thereby &s;hewn their judgement to be, that words cannot change the &s;ubjects to which they are applied, but the meaning of the words mu&s;t be determined by the nature of the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In Jer. xxviii. 8. the word <HI>hegnolam</HI> is u&s;ed in the Hebrew; but the tran&s;lators did not think them|&s;elves obliged to render it <HI>'from everla&s;ting,'</HI> or, <HI>from eternity;</HI>' as it would have been highly ab|&s;urd to have read, <HI>eternal</HI> prophets, or prophets which were from <HI>eternity;</HI> and have therefore ren|dered it <HI>'of old,'</HI> though it is a &s;tronger word than <HI>gnad,</HI> which they have tran&s;lated <HI>'eternity,'</HI> in I&s;a. lvii. 15.</P>
<P>Many other in&s;tances of the like nature, might be brought; but the&s;e are fully &s;ufficient to con|vince any unprejudiced mind, that nothing can be
<PB N="21" REF="025050_0077_102D762675F9EAB8">
concluded in favour of <HI>endle&s;s puni&s;hment,</HI> from the word <HI>aionion</HI> being u&s;ed to &s;et forth the duration of it, as well as the duration of that life which our Saviour promi&s;es to the righteous.</P>
<P>But upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that our Saviour intends no more by the 'life eternal,' in the 46th ver&s;e of the xxvth of St. Matthew's go&s;pel, than he doth in the 34th ver&s;e, by 'the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world.' (which it would be hard to prove) then an an&s;wer might be given, without all this labour, in this manner; <HI>viz.</HI> that as the Father hath appointed Chri&s;t a kingdom, &s;o he hath al&s;o appointed his &s;aints a kingdom; (See St. Luke, xxii. 29, 30. Rev. ii. 26, 27. iii. 21.) but as the kingdom which the Father hath given to Chri&s;t, as Mediator, and as Judge, &s;hall <HI>end,</HI> when he &s;hall have &s;ubdued all things, and put down all rule, and authority, and power; (See 1. Cor. xv. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.) &s;o, of con&s;equence, that kingdom which is given to the &s;aints or overcom|ers, to &s;ubdue the nations, &s;hall al&s;o <HI>end,</HI> when they &s;hall be all &s;ubdued, and brought to &s;ubmit. But as the glory of Chri&s;t &s;hall not be <HI>le&s;&s;ened,</HI> but <HI>in|crea&s;ed,</HI> when God &s;hall be ALL in ALL; &s;o the happine&s;s of the &s;aints &s;hall be &s;o far from end|ing, or being <HI>dimini&s;hed,</HI> at that period, that it &s;hall then arrive at the &s;ummit of perfection; but &s;hall never clo&s;e, nor decrea&s;e, while JEHOVAH endures.</P>
<P>Some time ago, a woman came to hear me, and I happened to mention in my &s;ermon, that Chri&s;t's mediatorial kingdom was called <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> or <HI>ai|onion;</HI> but that <HI>it mu&s;t come to an end,</HI> when the kingdom &s;hould be delivered up to the Father, when he &s;hould have put down all rule, and all
<PB N="22" REF="025050_0078_102D75F8D246F098">
authority and power. After &s;ermon, &s;he was a&s;k|ed, how &s;he liked? She an&s;wered, 'Not at all: he &s;ays, The <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> kingdom of Chri&s;t &s;hall end; and I never heard of &s;uch a thing before in all my life; and I am &s;ure it mu&s;t be contrary to Scripture.' The per&s;on who a&s;ked her, told her, that there was &s;uch a text &s;omewhere, &s;he could not tell exactly where to find it. But the woman per&s;i&s;ted in it, that there was no &s;uch text; and went away, full of prejudice. Now, had this pa&s;&s;age of Scripture been in the Book of the Revelations, it would not have been &s;o much to be wondered at, that &s;he had never heard of it; but when we con&s;ider, that this is expre&s;&s;|ed in that part of the 15th chapter of St. Paul's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, which is in the <HI>bu|rial &s;ervice</HI>&mdash;what &s;hall we &s;ay?</P>
<P>Thus, if <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> kingdom <HI>&s;hall end,</HI> much more <HI>Satan's!</HI> If <HI>rewards,</HI> as &s;uch, &s;hall cea&s;e; how much more <HI>puni&s;hments!</HI> If the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> king|dom of the &s;aints, which they &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> (See Dan. vii 18, 27.) &s;hall end, or be &s;wallowed up in that kingdom of boundle&s;s love, where God &s;hall be ALL IN ALL; how much much more, &s;hall all &s;in, pain, &s;orrow, and death, cea&s;e, and have no more a name in God's crea|tion!</P>

<P>I &s;hould have a right to expect, in the fir&s;t place, that there would be no promi&s;es in the Scripture to the contrary; no &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e: 'For I have &s;worn by my&s;elf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and

Swearing allegiance, as every civilian will tell you, implies <HI>pardon, reception,</HI> and <HI>protection,</HI> on the part of the king; and a hearty <HI>renouncing of rebellion, true &s;ubjection,</HI> and <HI>willing obedience,</HI> on the part of the rebels. Kings of the earth may be deceived, but God cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he will never accept of any feign|ed &s;ubjection; and therefore, all that &s;wear, &s;hall &s;wear in truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s; &s;o &s;hall rebellion cea&s;e, and di&s;obedience be no more.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle St. Paul, &s;eems to quote this pa&s;|&s;age of Scripture with &s;ome variation, in his epi&s;|tle to the Philippians, chap. ii. 9, 10, 11; where, &s;peaking of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, and the con|&s;equences of the &s;ame, he &s;ays, 'Wherefore God al&s;o hath highly exalted him, and given him a a name, which is above every name; that at (<HI>or</HI> in) the name of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> every knee &s;hall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue &s;hould confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.' Now, this confe&s;&s;ion appears to me to imply <HI>a willing &s;ubjection to the authority of the Saviour,</HI> brought about by the operation of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit; for the &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;aith, Wherefore, I give you to under&s;tand, that no man, &s;peaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Je|&s;us accur&s;ed; and no man can &s;ay that Je&s;us is the Lord, but by the Holy Gho&s;t,' 1 Cor. xii. 3.</P>
<P>Then the argument, thrown into a &s;yllogi&s;tical form, will run thus:</P>
<P>If every knee &s;hall bow, of things in heaven,
<PB N="24" REF="025050_0080_102D75FB2AC57E50">
and thing in earth, and things under the earth; then &s;hall all rebellion cea&s;e.</P>
<P>But the fir&s;t is ture; therefore, al&s;o the la&s;t. If every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God the Father; and no man can &s;ay that Je&s;us is the Lord, but by the Holy Gho&s;t; then &s;hall the Holy Gho&s;t work effectually in every man. As the major is proved, by Phil. ii. 11. and the minor, by 1 Cor. xii. 3, the conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be evident to a demon&s;tra|tion.</P>

<P>I have, indeed, heard &s;ome a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame: But as the glory of God is the ultimate end of all that he doth, we may properly a&s;k, why he &s;hould take any pains to &s;ave mankind?</P>
<P>But, above all, there is one objection that may be brought again&s;t this idea, which is hard to an|&s;wer; and that is, God hath &s;aid, 'For I have no plea&s;ure in the death of him that dieth, &s;aith the
<PB N="25" REF="025050_0081_102D762A9E1F3E20">
Lord GOD. Say unto them, As I live, &s;aith the Lord GOD, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and live: turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O Hou&s;e of I&s;rael? Ezek. xviii. 23. xxxiii. 11. It is evident to me, that God mu&s;t take plea&s;ure in what glorifies his name; and as he hath &s;worn, that he takes no plea&s;ure at all in the death of the wicked, it mu&s;t be &s;et down for a truth, that <HI>puni&s;hment,</HI> without hav|ing the reformation and &s;ubjection of rebels for its end, is unworthy of the Being we adore; and even now, it is called, <HI>'his &s;trange work,'</HI>and <HI>'his &s;trange act.'</HI> But to proceed: If <HI>endle&s;s</HI> mi&s;ery were a truth, I &s;hould not expect that the my&s;tery of the will of God, which he hath made known unto his cho&s;en, according to his good plea&s;ure, which he hath purpo&s;ed in him&s;elf, would be, 'That, in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, he might ga|ther together in one, (<HI>or</HI> rehead) all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in heaven, and which are in earth,' Ephe&s;. i. 9, 10. Far le&s;s &s;hould I expect to find, that 'It plea&s;ed the Father that in him &s;hould all fulne&s;s dwell; and having made peace by the blood of his cro&s;s, by him, to recon|cile all things to him&s;elf; by him, I &s;ay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.' Col. i. 19, 20. And I am not able to imagine, how St. John's vi&s;ion (Rev. v. 13.) could be ju&s;t, if <HI>endle&s;s damnation</HI> is true, where he &s;ays, 'And every creature who is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them, heard I, &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.' In the nature of
<PB N="26" REF="025050_0082_102D75FCF36C17D0">
things, it appears impo&s;&s;ible to me to believe the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages to be &s;trictly and literally true, if <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery</HI> be a truth: Therefore I &s;ay, that I &s;hould not expect any <HI>intimations,</HI> far le&s;s <HI>ab&s;olute promi&s;es,</HI> that God would de&s;troy death, the works of the devil, and make all things new, with many others of the like nature.</P>
<P>We find it promi&s;ed, that every knee &s;hall bow: and le&s;t &s;ome might &s;ay, that <HI>every</HI> knee, meant only <HI>&s;ome</HI> knees, it is explained by the in&s;pired apo&s;tle, to mean <HI>all</HI> things in heaven, and in earth, and under the earth: and not only &s;o, but every tongue &s;hall <HI>&s;wear,</HI> and <HI>confe&s;s</HI> that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God the Father; which could not be, except all were reconciled to him, whether things in heaven, or things in earth: Wherefore, this is al&s;o promi&s;ed; and, in con&s;equence of their being &s;ubdued, humbled, made obedient, and reconciled, they &s;hall be <HI>reheaded in Chri&s;t;</HI> never more to go a&s;tray, nor break that band of eternal union, which &s;hall bind all together in one body, joined to one head; and all &s;hall give never-cea&s;ing prai&s;e to God and the Lamb, <HI>world without end.</HI></P>
<P>As endle&s;s damnation appears to me to be <HI>again&s;t the promi&s;es,</HI> I cannot hold it as an article of my faith; but were there no promi&s;es or intimations to the contrary in Scripture, I &s;hould not require it to be threatened in any &s;tronger terms than it is; I &s;hould believe it as a truth, though I might not be able, at pre&s;ent, to &s;ee the propriety and equity thereof; I &s;hould never &s;uffer my weak rea&s;on to gain&s;ay Divine Revelation: But my difficulty ari&s;es from the&s;e expre&s;s promi&s;es of God, which com|po&s;e &s;o great a part of that book which is given us as a rule of faith and practice; and which promi|&s;es

<P>But though I have acknowledged that I &s;hould not dare to di&s;pute the doctrine of <HI>endle&s;s damnation,</HI> unle&s;s God had given <HI>intimations,</HI> and even <HI>promi&s;es,</HI> to the contrary; &s;ince I find &s;everal dreadful threat|enings in Scripture, in which the word <HI>aionion,</HI> or <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> is joined with the puni&s;hment of the wicked; yet, a very little attention will &s;hew us, that the felicity of the righteous is promi&s;ed in much &s;tronger language, than the mi&s;ery of the wicked is threatened, in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>I remark, in the fir&s;t place, that the word <HI>aio|nion,</HI> rendered <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> or <HI>eternal</HI> is u&s;ed much oftener in St. John's go&s;pel alone, to expre&s;s the continuance of the life, or well-being, of the righ|teous, than it is u&s;ed in the whole Bible, to ex|pre&s;s the mi&s;ery of the wicked; and this remark is &s;trengthened by ob&s;erving, that he never once u&s;es the word in his whole go&s;pel, nor in his epi&s;|tles, to &s;et froth the duration of puni&s;hment. See St. John, iii. 15, 16, 36. iv. 14. v. 24. vi. 27, 40, 47, 54, 68. x. 28. xii. 25, 50. xvii. ver. 2, 3. in all which pa&s;&s;ages, the word <HI>aionion</HI> is u&s;ed to expre&s;s the continuance of the well-being of the righteous.</P>
<P>But, not to in&s;i&s;t on this: I ob&s;erve, that there are many &s;tronger expre&s;&s;ions (even in our tran&s;la|tion) to &s;et forth the well-being of the righteous, than any that are u&s;ed as connected with the mi&s;ery

<P>We read, in 1 Pet. i. 4. of 'an inheritance, <HI>in|corruptible,</HI> and undefiled; and that <HI>fadeth not a|way,</HI> re&s;erved in heaven:' and in chap. v. 4. of 'a crown of glory, that <HI>fadeth not away:</HI>' and, Heb. xii. 28. of a 'kingdom, which cannot be moved:' And our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's words are re|markably &s;trong upon this &s;ubject, in many pla|ces; as in St. Luke's go&s;pel, chap. xx. 35, 36, where he &s;ays, 'But they who &s;hall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the (fir&s;t) re&s;ur|rection from the dead, neither marry, nor are giv|en in marriage: neither <HI>can they die any more:</HI> for they are equal unto the angels; and are the chil|dren of God, being the children of the re&s;urrec|tion:' And in St. John, x. 27, 28, 29. we read thus: 'My &s;heep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life: and they &s;hall <HI>never peri&s;h,</HI> neither &s;hall any pluck them out of my hand. My Fa|ther, who gave them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, is greater than all; and none in able to pluck them out of My Father's hand.' In chap. xi. 25, 26.

Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good plea&s;ure to give you the kingdom.

This is that which St. Paul calleth 'a better and an enduring &s;ub&s;tance,' Heb. x. 34. But what &s;hall I &s;ay of the apo&s;tle's words, 2 Cor. iv. 7?

<P>But it is not &s;o much by the different words made u&s;e of to denote the permanency of the feli|city of the righteous, from tho&s;e which are u&s;ed to expre&s;s the duration of the mi&s;ery of the wick|ed, that I judge of the <HI>continuance of the one</HI> be|yond the other; &s;o much as from the different &s;ources from whence they flow, and of their dif|ferent natures.</P>

It may be proved, that the union &s;hall continue between Chri&s;t and his faithful ones after this life, and &s;hall become indi&s;&s;oluble; and that neither 'tribulation, nor di&s;tre&s;s, nor per&s;ecution, nor fa|mine, nor nakedne&s;s, nor peril, nor &s;word; neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre&s;ent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate us (who abide in him) from the love of God which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord?'

<P>The never-ending continuance of the life, or &s;tate of well-being of the righteous, may be cer|tainly inferred, with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, from the continuance of the life of Chri&s;t; who is made an high-prie&s;t, 'not after the law of a carnal com|mandment, but after the power of an endle&s;s life,' Heb. vii. 16. And he hath expre&s;sly declared, 'Becau&s;e I live, ye &s;hall live al&s;o,' St. John xiv. 19. Thus, as long as the cau&s;e remains, the ef|fect mu&s;t continue; but the cau&s;e, even the life
<PB N="31" REF="025050_0087_102D76304764E608">
of Chri&s;t, mu&s;t undoubtedly continue to endle&s;s periods; therefore al&s;o, the effect, or the life of tho&s;e who are joined to him in an indi&s;&s;oluble uni|on, &s;hall continue. The apo&s;tle Paul under&s;tood logic as well as any in our days: and he thus rea|&s;ons upon this glorious truth; 'The &s;pirit it&s;elf beareth witne&s;s with our &s;pirits, that we (who are led by the Spirit of God, and have received the &s;pirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father) 'are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chri&s;t: if &s;o be that we &s;uffer with him, that we may be al&s;o glorified together,' Rom, viii. 16, 17.</P>
<P>Now, as Chri&s;t, the principal heir, cannot be di&s;inherited; &s;o, neither can tho&s;e who are joint heirs with him. The Holy Spirit is given us as the earne&s;t of our inheritance, and to &s;eal us to the day of redemption, 2 Cor. v. 5. Ephe&s;. i. 13, 14, and iv. 30. Chri&s;t is the head, and the overcom|ers through the blood of the Lamb, are the members of his body, and &s;hall inherit all things; he will be their God, and they &s;hall be his children: he is their life, and he 'will make them pillars in the temple of God, and they &s;hall go no more out,' Rev. iii. 12. St. Paul &s;ays, 'When Chri&s;t, who is our life, &s;hall appear, then &s;hall ye al&s;o appear with him in glory,' Col. iii. 4. And St. John &s;ays, 'Behold what manner of love the Father hath be|&s;towed upon us, that we &s;hould be called the &s;ons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, becau&s;e it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the &s;ons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we &s;hall be: but we know, that when he &s;hall ap|peap, we &s;hall be like him; for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is,' 1 John iii. 1, 2. Thus, we are &s;ure, from
<PB N="32" REF="025050_0088_102D7602DEDF88B0">
the Scriptures, and from the nature of things, that tho&s;e who are drawn by the Father, united to the Son, &s;ealed by the Holy Gho&s;t, willingly choo&s;e the Lord for their portion, and con&s;tantly adhere to him to the end, &s;hall never be &s;eparated from him in the future ages; for he him&s;elf &s;aith, 'As the living Father hath &s;ent me, and I live by the Father; &s;o he that eateth me, even he &s;hall live by me,' St. John, vi. 57. And as Chri&s;t is the great attracting load&s;tone, that &s;hall finally draw all things to him; it is evident, that he will pre&s;erve <HI>for ever,</HI> tho&s;e whom he hath thoroughly drawn to him&s;elf, and who have adhered to him through the time of trial. Thus is the life eternal of the righteous, or their endle&s;s &s;tate of well-being, ex|pre&s;&s;ed in much &s;tronger language than the mi&s;ery of the wicked; and, moreover, has its foundation in the union between Chri&s;t and his church, and in the nature of things.</P>

<P>Your rea&s;oning would be conclu&s;ive, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that <HI>there are two eternal prin|ciples,</HI> viz. <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil;</HI> if it can be proved, that evil is coexi&s;tent with goodne&s;s, that it hath always been: then, the ab&s;olute eternity of &s;in and mi&s;ery may be ea&s;ily inferred. This is the true founda|tion of <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery,</HI> and it came from the Pagan theology: The Heathens believed in <HI>two eternal principles,</HI> ever warring again&s;t each other, and nei|ther fully prevailing; that men had the liberty of enli&s;ting under which they plea&s;ed; and that tho&s;e who in life cho&s;e virtue, &s;hould enjoy endle&s;s feli|city; while tho&s;e who cho&s;e, and adhered to vice, &s;hould eternally remain under its dominion, and of con&s;equence be always mi&s;erable. Thus, the in|fernal deities being judged by the poor Pagans to be as eternal as the good gods, and more power|ful; they &s;acrificed more to the evil principle than to the good, out of fear, and to appea&s;e the anger of tho&s;e abhorred, malevolent agents; hence, the frequency of human &s;acrifices.</P>
<P>Now, when the Chri&s;tian religion triumphed over Pagani&s;m in the Roman empire, many of the philo&s;ophers embraced and profe&s;&s;ed it, but withal, retained many of their Pagan notions; among which was the <HI>eternity</HI> of the&s;e two oppo&s;ite princi|ples: hence aro&s;e the ancient &s;ect of the Manichees, who believed not only the eternal exi&s;tence of two contrary eternal Gods, one good and the other evil; but al&s;o, that all vi&s;ible things were created by the devil; and upon this principle, they might argue the univer&s;ality of damnation, with as much ea&s;e and certainty, as we, upon the contrary, may argue the certainty of the univer&s;al Re&s;toration, accord|ing to that glorious promi&s;e of God, I&s;aiah, lvii. 16,

<P>One of the fir&s;t arguments that ever began to take hold of my mind, and to bring me to think &s;eriou&s;ly of the &s;y&s;tem of the Re&s;toration, was, what I read in a little book upon the &s;ubject call|ed, <HI>The Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel,</HI> &amp;c. and is there thus expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>'It is as impo&s;&s;ible that there &s;hould be two end|le&s;s contrary things, as that there &s;hould be two real contrary deities, a good God and a bad one, or two &s;orts of contrary creatures, both of truly divine original, &s;ome being made good by God, and others bad.

duration, which, although it has a beginning, yet &s;hall have no end, can only be the property of tho&s;e creatures, that are of divine original. For as the&s;e, according to the language of the &s;cripture, are of divine origin, and therefore are rooted in God, or in his almighty creating power, which has no beginning, they can al&s;o be everla&s;ting, their ex|i&s;tence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> duration can al&s;o be without end in God.

<P>The &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t are his natural &s;ubjects; he is their rightful &s;overeign: but Satan's &s;ubjects are &s;laves, led captive by him at his will; he is an u&s;urper, and all that are in bondage to him belong to Chri&s;t, who will finally draw them all to him|&s;elf.</P>

<P>This is very ea&s;ily done; for it is uni|ver&s;ally acknowledged by all Chri&s;tians, that all things are now, and have ever been &s;ubject to his controul; for when he was upon earth, in his low|e&s;t &s;tate of humiliation, even the unclean &s;pirits, the mo&s;t rebellious of beings, obeyed his word; which made tho&s;e who &s;aw his miracles cry, with amazement, 'What thing is this? what new doc|trine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean &s;pirits, and they obey him,' St. Mark, i. 27. The devils obeyed him univer&s;ally, in whatever he commanded them; and could not enter into the &s;wine without his permi&s;&s;ion; and how di&s;agreeable &s;oever his words were to them, they were <HI>forced</HI> to comply, without daring to complain; yea, they frequently &s;eemed like hum|ble &s;uppliants; and once we read, they went &s;o far as to adjure our ble&s;&s;ed Lord not to torment them: See St. Mark, v. 7. The winds, waves, fi&s;hes, all obey him; all di&s;ea&s;es, and even death it&s;elf, heard his voice, and departed at his bidding; and to his di&s;ciples he &s;aid, All power is given unto me, in heaven and in earth,' Matth. xxviii. 18. and certainly now, he is at 'the right hand of God, angels, and authorities, and powers, are made &s;ubject unto him,' 1 Pet. iii. 22. God hath exalted him far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named; not only in this <HI>age,</HI> (for &s;o I render the word <HI>aio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI>) but al&s;o in that which is to come; and

put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church," Ephe&s;. i. 21, 22. But, as though the apo&s;tle had known that the &s;en&s;e would be di&s;puted, he hath &s;aid, 'But now we &s;ee <HI>not yet all things put under him,</HI>' Heb. ii. 8. All things were &s;ubject to his controul, <HI>even on earth;</HI> and they cannot be le&s;s &s;o, now he is exalted to heaven, to the glory which he had with the Father before the world was; and yet, many years after his a&s;cen&s;ion, the apo&s;tle &s;ays, 'But now we &s;ee not <HI>yet</HI> all things put under him;' by which he mu&s;t certainly mean their being <HI>wil|lingly &s;ubject</HI> unto him; for, in all other &s;en&s;es, all things are <HI>now</HI> put under him, in the mo&s;t un|limited manner, as we have &s;een already. But the apo&s;tle goes on to tell how far the important work is accompli&s;hed, and that a &s;ure foundation is laid for its entire completion; &s;aying, 'But we &s;ee Je|&s;us, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the &s;uffering of death, crowned with glory and honour, that he, by the grace of God, &s;hould ta&s;te death for ALL;' (for &s;o the word <HI>pantos</HI> ought to be rendered.)

<P>Then the apo&s;tle adds, 'For it became him, for whom are <HI>all things,</HI> and by whom are <HI>all things,</HI> in bringing many &s;ons unto glory, to make the Captain of their &s;alvation perfect through &s;uffer|ings,' Heb. ii. 9, 10.</P>

<P>I have this to &s;ay, (and I can with truth declare it) that I never &s;hould have di&s;&s;ented from my brethren, had they only given me the li|berty of enjoying that natural right of freely thinking for my&s;elf in matters of religion.

It is al&s;o intimated by Ezekiel, that a fire &s;hall be kindled, to burn their weapons of war, &amp;c. which &s;hall la&s;t for &s;ome time. Hear his words: 'And they that dwell in the cities of I&s;rael &s;hall go forth, and &s;hall &s;et on fire and burn the weapons, both the &s;hields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand-&s;taves and the &s;pears; and they &s;hall burn them with fire &s;even years: &s;o that they &s;hall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the fore&s;ts; for they &s;hall burn the weapons with fire.'

<P>Thus have I endeavoured to give the plain &s;en&s;e of the text to which our Lord alluded; and I have not the &s;malle&s;t doubt of its being hereafter literally fulfilled.</P>
<P>I will now endeavour to give what appears to me the meaning of the text before us:&mdash;Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> threatened that tho&s;e who would not deny them|&s;elves, and cut off tho&s;e things that led them into &s;in, &s;hould hereafter &s;uffer infinitely greater incon|veniencies, by being ca&s;t into hell fire. And, Oh! who can conceive how dreadful a portion is threat|ened to &s;ome tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors! that they '&s;hall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indigna|tion; and &s;hall be tormented with fire and brim|&s;tone, in the pre&s;ence of the holy angels, and in the pre&s;ence of the Lamb: And the &s;moke of their torment a&s;cendeth up ages of ages; and they have no re&s;t, day nor night.' Rev. xiv. 10, 11.</P>
<P>Thus, as the enemies of God, who &s;hall be de|&s;troyed near Jeru&s;alem, &s;hall have their carca&s;es expo&s;ed, full of worms, and be an abhorring unto

<P>Similar threatnings we find po&s;itively pronoun|ced by Ezekiel, at the command of God: 'More|over the word of JEHOVAH came unto me &s;aying, Son of man, &s;et thy face towards the &s;outh, and drop thy words towards the &s;outh, and prophe&s;y again&s;t the fore&s;t of the &s;outh field, and &s;ay to the fore&s;t of the &s;outh, Hear the word of JEHOVAH; Thus &s;aith Adonai JEHOVAH, Behold I will kin|dle a fire in thee, and it &s;hall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame &s;hall not be quenched, and all faces from the &s;outh to the north, &s;hall be burnt therein; and all fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee that I JEHOVAH have kindled it; <HI>it &s;hall not be quenched.</HI>' Ezek. xx. 45, 46, 47, 48. See al&s;o Jer. vii. 20.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e threatnings were &s;urely executed; for the people did not hearken to God: he did certainly kindle a fire, and it burnt, and was not quenched, but con&s;umed Jeru&s;alem and all her palaces; and the beautiful fore&s;ts that were &s;o much e&s;teemed, &s;hared the &s;ame fate: But what per&s;on will argue, that the whole city and country mu&s;t be now in flames; and mu&s;t have been con|&s;uming,
<PB N="54" REF="025050_0110_102D76695EFAE498">
from the days of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, becau&s;e of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, 'The flaming flame &s;hall not be quenched,' &amp;c. &s;ince we know that Jeru&s;alem, and the country round about, have been &s;ince inhabited, and will be again, in a more glorious manner than ever?</P>
<P>Neither will it help the matter to &s;ay, that we mu&s;t under&s;tand the fire <HI>figuratively,</HI> for the anger of God, &amp;c. for he declares by Zechariah, after the &s;eventy years captivity, that he was 'returned to Jeru&s;alem <HI>with mercies.</HI>' See Zech. i. 16. And though the pre&s;ent de&s;olation of that land is com|pared to the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, Deut. xxix. 23&mdash;28. And Ezekiel not only &s;peaks of it as de&s;olate and wa&s;te, but as having been always &s;o; though we know it was formerly filled with inhabitants: (See Ezek. xxxvi. 34, 35, xxxviii. 8.) Yet all the prophets &s;peak of a time to come, when it &s;hall be much more flouri&s;hing than ever it hath been; and I&s;aiah &s;ays, 'Whereas thou ha&s;t been for&s;aken and hat|ed, &s;o that no man went through thee; I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. Thou &s;halt no more be termed For|&s;aken; neither &s;hall thy land be termed De&s;olate; but thou &s;halt be called Hephzibah <HI>(my delight is in her)</HI> and thy land Beulah <HI>(married);</HI> for JE|HOVAH delighteth in thee, and thy land &s;hall be married,' I&s;aiah lx. 15. lxii 4.</P>
<P>Thus we may &s;ee, by the&s;e and many other pa&s;|&s;ages, that predictions apparently directly contrary one to the other, may be all fulfilled upon the &s;ame land, people and per&s;ons; only allowing a proper time to each, without which we can never make &s;en&s;e of many prophecies.</P>

cormorants, bitterns, owls, ravens, dragons, &s;atyrs, wild bea&s;ts, thorns, nettles, and brambles. In the 10th ver&s;e we read of a period, called <HI>for ever,</HI> wherein this land is to be on fire and is not to be quenched, night nor day: and the &s;moke of it is to a&s;cend up <HI>for ever;</HI> but in the 17th ver&s;e, it is &s;aid, that the before-mentioned birds and bea&s;ts &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s it <HI>for ever,</HI> even from generation to generation &s;hall they dwell therein.

And thus the whole prophecy may be fulfilled; not in the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> but in <HI>different</HI> periods: And thus al&s;o, may all the threatenings, and all the promi&s;es, in the &s;acred book, be accompli&s;hed; not at once, but each in their &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>It appears evident, that our Lord, by alluding to a fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e that &s;hall burn on earth, and to worms that &s;hall devour the fle&s;h of the &s;lain, could not mean to prove the torments of men to be ab&s;o|lutely <HI>endle&s;s;</HI> at lea&s;t, the expre&s;&s;ions of the <HI>worm</HI> that <HI>dieth not,</HI> and <HI>the fire</HI> that <HI>is not quenched,</HI> do not <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> imply it; which has been &s;ufficient|ly proved, by the pa&s;&s;ages where the &s;ame or &s;i|milar expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed, where yet the &s;ubject cannot intend <HI>endle&s;s</HI> duration; and this is all that can be nece&s;&s;ary to prove at pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>What you have &s;aid concerning the fires that are repre&s;ented as unquenchable, in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, is worthy of attention; but you &s;hould con&s;ider, that the&s;e fires were all on earth, and in time, and therefore mu&s;t have an end, or cea&s;e to burn; but the fire of hell is in eternity, and therefore mu&s;t la&s;t as long as eternity &s;hall endure.

<P>Had tho&s;e <HI>unquenchable</HI> fires never gone out while earth endured, or while time la&s;ted, there might have been &s;ome force in this argument; but &s;ince the continuance of the fire does not depend upon the <HI>&s;ea&s;on</HI> in which it is kindled, but upon the <HI>combu&s;tibles</HI> that feed and &s;upport it, this can be no objection: Therefore, &s;ince tho&s;e unquenchable fires that have been mentioned, were kindled on earth, and yet not burn while earth la&s;ted, but have gone out long ago; there is no nece&s;&s;ity of

granting, (even though we &s;hould admit your pre|mi&s;es of the fire of hell being kindled in eternity) that the unquenchable fire of the burning lake <HI>mu&s;t</HI> unavoidably burn to <HI>all eternity,</HI> merely be|cau&s;e it is &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to that &s;tate: But if puni&s;hments only belong to tho&s;e ages of ages be|fore Chri&s;t &s;hall re&s;ign the kingdom to the Father, and the lake of fire &s;hall be this terraqueous globe, di&s;&s;olved, or melted, with fervent heat; then the ground is changed, and the whole objection va|ni&s;hes of cour&s;e.</P>

St. Mark, iii. 28, 29. This is &s;uch a matter of importance, that three of the evangeli&s;ts notice it. St. Luke hath it thus: 'And who&s;oever &s;hall &s;peak a word again&s;t the Son of man, it &s;hall (<HI>or</HI> may) be forgi|ven him; but unto him that bla&s;phemeth again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, it &s;hall not be forgiven,' St. Luke, xii. 10. St. Matthew &s;aith, this &s;in &s;hall not be forgiven in this world, nor in that to come; St. Mark, that &s;uch an one hath never forgivene&s;s, but is in danger of eternal damnation; and St. Luke po&s;itively &s;aith, it &s;hall not be forgiven: And, to confirm the matter &s;till more, if po&s;&s;ible, St. Paul &s;aith, 'For it is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who were once enlightened, and have ta&s;ted the hea|venly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Gho&s;t, and have ta&s;ted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they &s;hall fall away, (<HI>or,</HI> and have fallen away) to re|new them again to repentance; &s;eeing they cruci|fy to them&s;elves the Son of God afre&s;h, and put him to an open &s;hame. For if we &s;in wilfully, after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more &s;acrifice for &s;ins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which &s;hall devour the adver|&s;aries.

Heb. vi. 4, 5, 6, x. 26, 27, 28, 29. And the &s;ame Apo&s;tle directs us, &s;aying; 'Looking diligently, le&s;t any man fail of the grace of God; le&s;t any root of bitterne&s;s &s;pringing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: Le&s;t there be any fornicator, or profane per&s;on, as E&s;au, who for one mor&s;el of meat &s;old his birthright. For ye know how that after|wards, when he would have inherited the ble&s;&s;ing, he was rejected; for he found no place of re|pentance, though he &s;ought it with tears.' Heb. xii. 15, 16, 17.</P>
<P>And St. John, the beloved di&s;ciple, &s;ays; 'If any man &s;ee his brother &s;in a &s;in which is not unto death, he &s;hall a&s;k, and he &s;hall give him life for them that &s;in not unto death. There is a &s;in unto death: I do not &s;ay that he &s;hall pray for it,' 1 John v. 16.</P>
<P>Now here is a &s;in for which there is no forgive|ne&s;s, neither in this world (<HI>or</HI> age) or in that to come; which &s;hall not be forgiven at all; he that committeth it hath never forgivene&s;s, is in danger of eternal damnation; he cannot be renewed again to repentance, becau&s;e he hath crucified Chri&s;t to him&s;elf afre&s;h, and hath put him to an open &s;hame: having &s;inned wilfully and maliciou&s;ly, after receiv|ing the knowledge of the truth, to &s;uch no more &s;acrifice for &s;ins remaineth; judgment and fiery in|dignation are his certain portion, he is an adver|&s;ary,

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. We are &s;ure that the Scribes and Phari&s;ees of our Saviour's time, who bla&s;phemou&s;ly a&s;cribed
<PB N="62" REF="025050_0118_102D767090BA7C68">
his miracles to the power of the devil, did, in the mo&s;t direct and undeniable manner, commit that &s;in; and &s;ome are doubtful whether it can be com|mitted by any in the&s;e days.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It is generally acknowledged, that the He|brews were in danger of committing that &s;in, by openly and wilfully apo&s;tatizing from Chri&s;tianity, and publicly renouncing Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation, and bla&s;pheming again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, after having been partakers of its extraordinary gifts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It cannot be committed by ignorant per&s;ons, nor without a con&s;iderable degree of malice pre|pen&s;e; light in the under&s;tanding, and malice in the heart, are nece&s;&s;ary ingredients of this dreadful crime; and it appears to me, it mu&s;t be committed openly, and that it cannot be committed in thought only.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Under the Levitical di&s;pen&s;ation there were many unpardonable &s;ins&mdash;crimes that could not be forgiven or overlooked, and for which no atone|ment could be made, and which were puni&s;hed with death, without mercy; other crimes, unle&s;s &s;acrifices were offered, and repentance took place, &s;ubjected the parties to death al&s;o; but, under the go&s;pel, there is but one crime that is properly un|pardonable, and that ab&s;olutely &s;ubjects the per&s;on guilty of it to the &s;econd death; yet many other &s;ins are threatened with the &s;ame puni&s;hment con|ditionally, but they may be forgiven, and not pu|ni&s;hed at all; but this one mu&s;t as certainly be puni&s;hed with the &s;econd death, as murder or any other crime, was by the law of Mo&s;es puni&s;hed with the death of the body without mercy or for|givene&s;s. <HI>Forgery</HI> is the unpardonable &s;in of Eng|land: people frequently &s;uffer death for other
<PB N="63" REF="025050_0119_102D764138F47D78">
crimes, as well as this; but other offences are &s;ometimes forgiven, but this never; it is always puni&s;hed with death. This circum&s;tance may il|lu&s;trate my meaning. The &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t is an offence of that kind, that, either owing to its uncommon malignity (as is mo&s;t likely,) or &s;ome other cau&s;e, expo&s;es the guilty per&s;on to the age of judgment, from which he cannot e&s;cape by repentance, pardon, and &s;prinkling of the blood of Chri&s;t, as other &s;inners may; neither can he be at pre&s;ent born of the Spirit, to which he hath done de&s;pite; nor can he be reclaimed by any po&s;&s;ible means, in this age, or in the age that is to &s;uc|ceed this, but is inevitably bound over to &s;uffer the inconceivable torments of the &s;econd death, or lake of fire and brim&s;tone, after the day of judg|ment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. There is no kind of di&s;pute between us, re|&s;pecting the certainty of the puni&s;hment of &s;uch; in this we both agree: he that &s;inneth again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, is in danger of eternal damnation, or judgment, or the &s;econd death:&mdash;The que&s;tion is, Shall there ever come a time, when the &s;econd death, or lake of fire, &s;hall no more exi&s;t? If this can be proved, the conclu&s;ion will be evident, <HI>viz.</HI> that not one &s;hall remain under the power thereof to all eternity: Upon this, and this alone, depends the &s;olution of this awful, intere&s;ting, and mo&s;t im|portant que&s;tion: and I con&s;ider all other an&s;wers as mere quibbles, compared with this. And if it cannot be proved that a time will come, when all that bears the name of death &s;hall be de&s;troyed, tho&s;e who commit the &s;in unto death, mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, be allowed to &s;tand as exceptions to the general rule; and, I am apt to think, the rule it&s;elf will
<PB N="64" REF="025050_0120_102D7672224B3490">
be overthrown. I &s;hall therefore labour this point a little; and if I &s;hould be &s;o happy as to prove to your &s;atisfaction the total de&s;truction of death, it will an&s;wer many other objections as well as this. My only refuge is Scripture; if that fails me, I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to pur&s;ue the &s;ubject farther.</ITEM>

works of the devil, even all &s;in out of the univer&s;e, his purpo&s;e mu&s;t be eternally fru&s;trated:</P>
<P>But the la&s;t can never be; therefore the fir&s;t is true.</P>
<P>Heb. ii. 14. 'Fora&s;much, then, as the children are partakers of fle&s;h and blood, he al&s;o him&s;elf likewi&s;e took part of the &s;ame; that through death he might de&s;troy him that had the power of death, that is the devil.'&mdash;Now what death has the devil power over? the death of the body? or that of the &s;oul, which con&s;i&s;ts in enmity again&s;t God, and &s;eparation from him? 'To be carnally minded is death; but to be &s;piritually minded is life and peace. Becau&s;e the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God; for it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be,' Rom. viii. 6, 7. If this death, with the con&s;equence of it, is that which the de|vil hath the power of, then mu&s;t this death be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>But, I think, the fir&s;t is true; therefore al&s;o the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Rev. xxi. 4. we read, 'And God &s;hall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there &s;hall be no more <HI>Death,</HI> neither &s;orrow, nor crying, neither &s;hall there be any more pain: for the former things are pa&s;&s;ed away.' Here is a &s;tate &s;poken of beyond all death; a &s;tate wherein, &s;orrow, crying, and pain &s;hall be no more. This &s;tate is cotemporary with the new heaven and earth, after the lake of fire hath cea&s;ed.</P>

<P>We have always under&s;tood this pa&s;&s;age to relate to the death of the body, and even to the death of the righteous only; but making this &s;tate cotemporary with the new heavens and earth, &s;eems to throw a new light upon the &s;ubject.</P>

<P>Mo&s;t certainly the word <HI>Death</HI> here implies the &s;econd death; for we are informed, in the foregoing chapter, of the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, even that of the martyrs, who were beheaded for the witne&s;s of Je&s;us, and for the word of God; and &s;uch as had not wor&s;hipped the bea&s;t and his image, neither had received his mark in their fore|heads, or in their hands; then we read of a thou|&s;and years between this re&s;urrectien, and the re&s;t of the dead living again: after this, we find, that the dead, &s;mall and great, &s;tood before God, and were judged; and &s;uch as were not found written in the book of life, were ca&s;t into the lake of fire, which is expre&s;sly called 'the &s;econd death;' which as before ob&s;erved, is probably the earth in its melted &s;tate. In this chapter we find, that all things are to be made new; and <HI>Death</HI> is to be no more, neither &s;orrow, nor crying, neither any more pain. But this mu&s;t be the &s;econd death, or lake of fire; for the re&s;urrection of all the bodies, both of the ju&s;t and unju&s;t, had been &s;poken of before.</P>
<P>Thus, as all &s;in, and all that bears the name of death, &s;hall be entirely de&s;troyed at la&s;t; the doc|trine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery &s;eems to fall to the ground, or, at lea&s;t, cannot be certainly proved from Scrip|ture, but rather the contrary.</P>
<P>The time mu&s;t come when all things &s;hall be &s;ubject to Chri&s;t, when he &s;hall de&s;troy death, the la&s;t enemy, by de&s;troying &s;in, which is the &s;ting of death; &s;o this dreadful &s;in, as well as others, &s;hall be no more. For if this was not to be the ca&s;e, it never could be true, that 'where &s;in abounded, grace did much more abound:' for it never would abound quite &s;o much; neither would death and
<PB N="67" REF="025050_0123_102D76456341C5A8">
hell be &s;ilent when God &s;hall a&s;k the great que&s;|tions, 'O death where is thy &s;ting? O grave, (<HI>or</HI> hell) where is thy victory?' for death could &s;ay, Here is my &s;ting, that &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, which mu&s;t endure to all eternity, and which even divine grace &s;hall never de&s;troy; I have, therefore, the victory and dominion over the&s;e &s;inners who have committed it, and will hold it while God him|&s;elf exi&s;ts. Then death could never be de&s;troyed, nor &s;wallowed up in victory; neither would &s;or|row, crying, and pain cea&s;e; neither could God ever be ALL IN ALL, in any other &s;en&s;e, with re|&s;pect to them, than he is now; nor would <HI>every tongue &s;wear;</HI> neither would all things wholly be made new, nor all the former things ever pa&s;s away! neither could the univer&s;al chorus of prai&s;e ever be &s;ung by every creature, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and throughout God's wide domain; and, finally, many Scriptures would ne|ver &s;eem to be fulfilled, in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e. Rom. v. 20, 21. 'But where &s;in abounded, grace did much more abound; that as &s;in hath reigned unto death; even &s;o might grace reign, through righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, unto eternal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.' Now, if grace &s;hall abound more than &s;in, it &s;hall be as univer&s;al, and more powerful: But the fir&s;t is true; therefore al&s;o the la&s;t. If grace &s;hall be as exten&s;ive as &s;in, and more powerful, all who have &s;inned &s;hall be re&s;tored: But the fir&s;t is true; therefore al&s;o the la&s;t.</P>
<P>What con&s;equences mu&s;t follow from the &s;up|po&s;ition, that &s;ome of God's creatures &s;hall always remain his enemies! Either God created &s;ome to be mi&s;erable to endle&s;s ages, or mu&s;t be fru&s;trated

eternally in his de&s;igns, or all mu&s;t be re&s;tored at la&s;t, and made happy by love and free love.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is bla&s;phemous, the &s;econd is di&s;ho|nourable to God: therefore, the third mu&s;t be true: For I cannot think of a fourth conclu&s;ion.</P>

<P>What do you think of the deplorable ca&s;e of E&s;au, 'who, for one mor&s;el of meat, &s;old his birthright; and afterwards, when he would have inherited the ble&s;&s;ing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he &s;ought it carefully, with tears?'</P>

<P>He certainly lo&s;t, or rather &s;old, his birth-right; in con&s;equence of which, he lo&s;t the ble&s;&s;ing belonging to the fir&s;t-born: But le&s;t any &s;hould be led to conclude from this, that poor <HI>E&s;au</HI> had no ble&s;&s;ings at all, the &s;ame apo&s;tle informs us, that, 'By faith, I&s;aac ble&s;&s;ed Jacob and E&s;au, concerning things to come," Heb. xi. 20.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, mo&s;t certainly: But then this love and hatred, &s;o called, was manife&s;ted to their po&s;terity, and not to their per&s;ons, in the manner de&s;cribed by the prophet: 'I have loved you, &s;aith JEHOVAH: yet ye &s;ay, Wherein ha&s;t thou loved us? Was not E&s;au Jacob's brother? &s;aith JEHOVAH: yet I loved Jacob, and I hated E&s;au, and laid his mountains and his heritage wa&s;te, for the dragons of the wilderne&s;s.' This manife&s;tation of hatred did not affect the eternal &s;tate of their &s;ouls, but their condition in this world: God declared, that Jacob's &s;eed &s;hould exi&s;t: as a di&s;tinct people to the
<PB N="69" REF="025050_0125_102D7646F1443E60">
end of time, but that E&s;au's &s;hould not: and this difference is evident; for the remains of E&s;au's &s;eed were, in the days of the Maccabees, incorporated with the &s;eed of Jacob, and exi&s;ted no more for ever, as a nation by them&s;elves. From Jacob's race the Me&s;&s;iah was to come, and all nations were to be ble&s;&s;ed in the &s;eed of I&s;rael. In all the&s;e in|&s;tances, and in many others, there was a manife&s;t preference of Jacob to E&s;au; but nothing like po|&s;itive hatred can be intended.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;ays, (St. Luke, xiv. 26.) 'If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and &s;i&s;ters, yea, and his own life al&s;o, he cannot be my di&s;ci|ple.' But we cannot &s;uppo&s;e our Lord intended po&s;itive, but comparative hatred; according to St. Matth. x. 37. He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth &s;on or daughter more than me, is not wor|thy of me.'</P>

<P>I believe, that with <HI>man</HI> it is impo&s;&s;i|ble; but with God all things are po&s;&s;ible: And I believe, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was not only able to pa&s;s, but that he actually did pa&s;t that gulph, which was impa&s;&s;able to all <HI>men,</HI> but not to him: And he a&s;|&s;ures St. John, that he had pa&s;&s;ed it, and not only &s;o, but that he had the keys of the &s;ame in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; for he &s;aith, 'Fear not, I am the fir&s;t and the la&s;t; I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and death.' And St. Peter informs us; that 'Chri&s;t once &s;uffered for &s;ins, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, (that he might bring us unto God); being put to death in the fle&s;h, but quickened by the Spirit; by which al&s;o he went and preached to the &s;pirits in pri&s;on; who &s;ometime were di&s;o|bedient, when once the long &s;uffering of God waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing,' And he al&s;o tells us, that we '&s;hall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. For, for this cau&s;e was the go&s;pel preached al&s;o to them that are dead,' (in di&s;tinction from them that are quick) 'that they might be judged according to men in the fle&s;h, but live according to God in the &s;pirit.'

<P>Then ob&s;erve the next words, <HI>he went;</HI> here the idea of a journey to a di&s;tant place is in|timated, the original word being expre&s;&s;ive of an actual pa&s;&s;age from one place to another, and is the &s;ame that is u&s;ed in ver. 22, for the a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t into heaven, &s;o that he appears to have gone into the pri&s;on in the &s;ame proper &s;en&s;e, as he afterwards went into heaven. He actually journeyed to the place of confinement, <HI>and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">each|ed to the &s;pirits,</HI> &amp;c. He preached <HI>the go&s;pel</HI> no doubt, not to men in the body, but to <HI>the &s;pirits,</HI> to tho&s;e in a di&s;embodied &s;tate; not only &s;o, but to <HI>the &s;pirits in pri&s;on:</HI> Had they not been in the pri&s;on, Chri&s;t would not have gone into the pri&s;on to preach to them. But, who were the&s;e &s;pirits? St. Peter informs us, that they are tho&s;e who were <HI>&s;ometime di&s;obedient;</HI> but this expre&s;&s;ion intimates, that the time is perfectly pa&s;t; as, 'Ye <HI>were</HI> the &s;ervants of &s;in: for when ye <HI>were</HI> the &s;ervants of &s;in, ye <HI>were</HI> free from righteou&s;ne&s;s,' Rom. vi. 17, 20. St. Peter tells us when they were di&s;o|bedient; <HI>when once the long-&s;uffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing:</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="025050_0128_102D76781820E140">
Here he evidently di&s;tingui&s;hes the two periods of their vi&s;itation; one is called the preaching of Chri&s;t, by his &s;pirit, after he was put to death in the fle&s;h; and the other is called the long-&s;uffer|ing of God, which waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing. The long-&s;uffering of God waited upon them, before they were drowned, while the ark was building; but Chri&s;t preached to them when they were &s;pirits in pri&s;on. They were di&s;obedient to God's long-&s;uffering; but it is not certain that they were &s;o when Chri&s;t preached to them; but the contrary is intimated in the&s;e words: <HI>'For, this cau&s;e was the go&s;pel preached al&s;o to them that are dead,'</HI> &amp;c. This can|not intend tho&s;e that are <HI>&s;piritually</HI> dead only, but tho&s;e who&s;e bodies are dead; becau&s;e we here find <HI>the dead</HI> &s;et in oppo&s;ition to <HI>the quick,</HI> or tho&s;e who&s;e bodies are alive, and not tho&s;e that are <HI>&s;piritually alive;</HI> for we may ob&s;erve, that whenever the words <HI>quick</HI> and <HI>dead</HI> occur, by <HI>quick,</HI> we always under&s;tand tho&s;e who&s;e bodies are alive; and by <HI>dead,</HI> tho&s;e who have cea&s;ed to exi&s;t here.</P>
<P>Acts, x. 40, &amp;c. St. Peter, in his &s;ermon to Cor|nelius and his family, informed them of Je&s;us, who was &s;lain, whom 'God rai&s;ed from the dead, and &s;hewed him openly: not to all the people, but unto witne&s;&s;es, cho&s;en before of God; even to us, who did eat and drink with him, after he ro&s;e from the dead. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to te&s;tify, that it is he, who was ordained of God to be the judge of <HI>quick</HI> and <HI>dead.</HI>' And St. Paul &s;ays to Timothy, I charge thee, therefore, before God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;hall judge the <HI>quick</HI> and the <HI>dead</HI> at his appearing, and his kingdom;
<PB N="73" REF="025050_0129_102D764ACBD8CA88">
preach the word,' &amp;c. See 2 Tim. iv. 1. So, in 1 Pet. iv. 5. the words <HI>quick</HI> and <HI>dead</HI> are u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner; and then immediately, while the idea is warm in our minds, the apo&s;tle gives us the rea&s;ons why the go&s;pel was preached to <HI>the dead,</HI> (<HI>or</HI> the &s;pirits in pri&s;on) of which he had be|fore informed us, and now repeats again, and a&s;|&s;ures us, that it was, <HI>that they might be judged ac|cording to men, in the fle&s;h;</HI> or, as though they had heard it while they were alive in the fle&s;h: but al&s;o, that they might <HI>live according to God, in the &s;pirit.</HI> The go&s;pel not only <HI>was,</HI> but <HI>is,</HI> preached to them that are dead, in a <HI>moral</HI> or <HI>&s;piritual</HI> &s;en&s;e. It need not have been &s;aid; <HI>For, for this cau&s;e was the go&s;pel preached</HI> ALSO <HI>to them that are dead,</HI> if only the &s;piritually dead are intended; for it is rarely preached to any other but &s;uch. Why &s;hould it be &s;aid, <HI>that they might be judged according to men in the fle&s;h,</HI> if they were men in the fle&s;h at the time when it was preached to them?</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age proves the exi&s;tence of the &s;oul after the death of the body: for unle&s;s the &s;ouls of the antedeluvians exi&s;ted after the drowning of their bodies, Chri&s;t could not have preached to them in pri&s;on: But the <HI>dead</HI> being oppo&s;ed to the <HI>quick</HI> in this pa&s;&s;age, &s;ufficiently, and even inconte&s;tibly, determines the &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>With a little attention, we may ea&s;ily be con|vinced, that Chri&s;t was not only de&s;igned to be a Covenant of the people, (meaning the Jews) and a Light to the Gentiles; which two de&s;criptions comprehend all the living: but al&s;o, to bring out the pri&s;oners from the pri&s;on, and them that &s;it in darkne&s;s out of the pri&s;on-hou&s;e; which (if it
<PB N="74" REF="025050_0130_102D767BF18569F8">
be not a repetition) mu&s;t intend the <HI>dead,</HI> as all the <HI>living</HI> were mentioned before.</P>
<P>'And he &s;aid, It is a light thing that thou &s;houlde&s;t be my &s;ervant, to rai&s;e up the tribes of Jacob, and to re&s;tore the pre&s;erved of I&s;rael: I will al&s;o give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou maye&s;t be my &s;alvation unto the ends of the earth. Thus &s;aith JEHOVAH, In an acceptable time have I heard thee and in a day of &s;alvation have I helped thee: and I will pre&s;erve thee, and give thee for a covenant to the people, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the earth, to cau&s;e to inherit the de&s;olate he|ritages.' Thus far the Redeemer's work &s;eems li|mited to the earth, and re&s;pects the living: But the prophet goes much farther, and &s;ays, 'That thou maye&s;t &s;ay to the pri&s;oners, Go forth: to them that are in darkne&s;s, Shew your&s;elves: they &s;hall feed in the ways, and their pa&s;tures &s;hall be in all high places. They &s;hall not hunger, nor thir&s;t neither &s;hall the heat nor &s;un &s;mite them; for he that hath mercy upon them &s;hall lead them, even by the &s;prings of water &s;hall he guide them.'

&s;poil principalities, and redeem the captives whom he had bought with his blood, in order that he might a&s;cend up to Heaven, and open to his followers the gates of eternal life.</P>
<P>'Wherefore he &s;aith, When he a&s;cended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. Now that he a&s;cended, what is it but that he al&s;o de&s;cended fir&s;t into the lower parts of the earth? He that de&s;cended, is the &s;ame al&s;o that a&s;cended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things,' Ephe&s;. iv. 8, 9, 10. 'And having &s;poiled principalities and powers, he made a &s;hew of them openly, triumphing over them in it,' Col. ii. 15.</P>
<P>Thus our Saviour by his divine proce&s;s, hath obtained a right to open the pri&s;on doors, and let the captives go free: and though the rich man was in torments, where he could not get a drop of wa|ter to cool his tongue, and had <HI>judgment without mercy,</HI> becau&s;e he had <HI>&s;hewed no mercy;</HI> yet it is po&s;|&s;ible, that, by the blood of the covenant, he may be &s;ent forth out of the pit wherein is no water.

<P>This amazing deliverance &s;eems to be de&s;cribed in &s;uch language, as corre&s;ponds much better with the deliverance of the &s;pirits from their dreadful pri&s;on, than with any temporal mercies that are be&s;towed on mankind <HI>here on earth.</HI> 'The righteous &s;hall &s;ee it, and rejoice; and all iniqui|ty &s;hall &s;top her mouth: Who&s;o is wi&s;e, and will ob&s;erve the&s;e things, even they &s;hall under|&s;tand the loving kindne&s;s of JEHOVAH,' ver. 42, 43.</P>

<P>Thus, how impo&s;&s;ible &s;oever it might appear to us, that the rich man &s;hould ever be delivered, we mu&s;t remember, that 'with God nothing &s;hall

<P>Our Saviour &s;ays, (St. Matt. xix. 24, St. Mark x. 25. St. Luke xviii. 25.) 'It is ea&s;ier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.' Whe|ther the word here u&s;ed, intends a camel or a ca|ble, it certainly implied the greate&s;t difficulty imagi|nable, even amounting in the view of his di&s;ciples, to a natural impo&s;&s;ibility, or they would not have been as the evangeli&s;t expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>exceedingly amaz|ed, and a&s;toni&s;hed out of mea&s;ure</HI> at his words, ' &s;ay|ing among them&s;elves, Who then can be &s;aved?' But, though Je&s;us meant to repre&s;ent the matter as in it&s;elf a kind of natural impo&s;&s;ibility, and ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to men; yet he could not in|tend thereby, that it never &s;hould be accompli&s;h|ed, becau&s;e he immediately adds, 'With men, this is impo&s;&s;ible; but not with God: For with God all things are po&s;&s;ible,' St. Mark x. 27. Therefore, though it was impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>men</HI> to pa&s;s the gulph between <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Gehenna;</HI> yet, as we have &s;een, Chri&s;t was able, and therefore as we know not the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of his power to &s;ave, we cannot po&s;itively conclude <HI>again&s;t the Re&s;toration,</HI> from this in&s;tance of the rich man, unle&s;s we could find &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, where God has promi&s;ed never to re&s;tore, or to reconcile &s;uch to him&s;elf, whom he hath once ca&s;t off: the contrary to which, I think, may be proved: but I am at pre&s;ent con&s;idering, that, in the nature of things, it is not impo&s;&s;ible for God to re&s;tore the rich

man, if he &s;o plea&s;es; and, con&s;equently, others that are in the &s;ame &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Behold the rich man in another world!&mdash;He &s;eems <HI>now</HI> to have much more true benevolence in him, than in his life-time; for when he could not obtain a drop of water for his tongue, he pleads much more earne&s;tly for Lazarus to be &s;ent to his five brethren, to te&s;tify to them, le&s;t they al&s;o &s;hould come into the &s;ame place of torment with him&s;elf. Here he urges the matter mo&s;t earne&s;t|ly, and does not &s;eem willing to be denied. This &s;hews him not to have been &s;o lo&s;t to virtue as Sa|tan; &s;ince he and his angels, though mi&s;erable them&s;elves, &s;eek to make all men &s;o too, though their torments are increa&s;ed thereby.</P>
<P>Add to all this, that Abraham called the rich man, <HI>'Son,'</HI> and bade him remember, that in his life-time he had his good things: and likewi&s;e La|zarus, evil things; and that therefore it was but rea&s;onable that the &s;cene &s;hould be changed: that Lazarus &s;hould be comforted, and he tormented. And I think, nothing can be fairly argued from his ca&s;e, in favour of <HI>endle&s;s damnation:</HI> For in ca&s;e he was doomed to &s;uffer <HI>while God exi&s;ts,</HI> there could be no proportion between the &s;ufferings, torments, and evil things of Lazarus on earth, and tho&s;e which <HI>he</HI> endured in hell; whereas it is inti|mated in the Scriptures, that all things are deter|mined by number, weight, and mea&s;ure. Let us hear what our Lord has &s;aid upon the &s;ubject. St. Luke xii. 47, 48. 'And that &s;ervant who knew his Lord's will, and prepared not him&s;elf, neither did according to his will, &s;hall be beaten with MA|NY &s;tripes.

<P>I am inclined to think with you in this matter: and therefore, without any farther delay, I &s;hall pa&s;s to mention another &s;trong objection to the doctrine of the Re&s;toration of all men; <HI>viz.</HI> the in&s;tance of <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">das:</HI> of whom our Saviour &s;ays, 'The Son of man goeth, as it is written of him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed; it had been good for that man, if he had not been born, St. Matt. xxvi. 24. St. Mark, xiv. 21. If Judas &s;hould ever be re&s;tored, how could the Saviour &s;ay, 'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born?'

<P>I cannot think that this is &s;o &s;trong an argument again&s;t the general Re&s;titution, as mo&s;t that u&s;e it imagine. It was a common proverb among the Jews, when any great misfortune hap|pened to a man, or his family, to &s;ay, 'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born.' And thus our Saviour u&s;ed it with great propriety re&s;pecting Judas: for who, that thinks with any rea&s;on at all, would not have wi&s;hed that he had never been born, rather than to have betrayed the dear Redeemer?</P>

<P>But can any thing le&s;s than <HI>endle&s;s</HI> dam|nation be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the expre&s;&s;ion of 'Good were it for that man, that he had never been born?'</P>

<P>I am of opinion that even worldly troubles (&s;hort as they are) may &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify the expre&s;&s;ion. There are a thou&s;and circum&s;tan|ces into which the children of Adam fall, that make their ca&s;e infinitely wor&s;e than though they had never been born, even without &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;tate of future puni&s;hment at all. I had rather, a thou|&s;and times, never have been born, than to have be|trayed Chri&s;t, even upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that I had never been doomed to &s;uffer for it beyond this life. Job, when he had lo&s;t his &s;ub&s;tance, his children, and his ea&s;e, opened his mouth, and, through exce&s;s of grief cur&s;ed the day of his birth: though it does not appear that he had any fear of future damnation, but the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>'And Job &s;pake, and &s;aid, 'Let the day pe|ri&s;h wherein I was born; and the night in which it was &s;aid, There is a man-child conceived. Let that day be darkne&s;s; let not God regard it from above; neither let the light &s;hine upon it. Let darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death &s;tain it; let a cloud dwell upon it: let the blackne&s;s of day ter|rify it. As for that night, let darkne&s;s &s;eize upon it: let it not be joined unto the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months. Lo! let that night be &s;olitary; let no joyful voice come therein. Let them cur&s;e it that cur&s;e the day, who are ready to rai&s;e up their mourning. Let the &s;tars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it &s;ee the dawning of the day; becau&s;e it &s;hut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid &s;orrow from mine eyes. Why died I not from the womb? Why did not I give up the gho&s;t, when I came out of the belly? Why did the knees prevent
<PB N="83" REF="025050_0139_102D7654767DD058">
me? or, why the brea&s;ts that I &s;hould &s;uck? For now &s;hould I have been &s;till, and been quiet; I &s;hould have &s;lept; then had I been at re&s;t, with kings and coun&s;ellors of the earth, who built de&s;o|late places for them&s;elves; or with princes, that had gold, who filled their hou&s;es with &s;ilver: Or, as an hidden, untimely birth, I had not been; as infants, who never &s;aw light. There the wicked cea&s;e from troubling; and there the weary be at re&s;t. There the pri&s;oners re&s;t together: they hear not the voice of the oppre&s;&s;er. The &s;mall and great are there; and the &s;ervant is free from his ma&s;ter,' See Job, iii. 2&mdash;19.</P>
<P>From this di&s;cour&s;e, it &s;eems, that Job thought it would have been better for him never to have been born, than to have fallen into &s;uch fore trou|bles in this pre&s;ent life, without taking the other into his account; but if he had known that he had been doomed to &s;uffer the amazing torments of the &s;econd death, in the lake of fire and brim|&s;tone, what would he have &s;aid? Even upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that it was only to la&s;t for ages, he would have thought that his being born into this world, to be fitted for &s;uch a puni&s;hment, would have been the greate&s;t cur&s;e that could have be|fallen him.</P>
<P>If Job, who could &s;ay, 'I know that my Re|deemer liveth, and that he &s;hall &s;tand at the lat|ter day upon the earth: And, though after my &s;kin worms de&s;troy this body, yet in my fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee God: whom I &s;hall &s;ee for my&s;elf, and mine eyes &s;hall behold, and not another; though my reins be con&s;umed within me. He knoweth the way that I take; and when he hath tried me, I &s;hall come forth as gold. My foot hath held his

&s;teps; his way have I kept, and not declined; nei|ther have I gone back from the commandment of his lips: I have e&s;teemed the words of his mouth more than my nece&s;&s;ary food. Though he &s;lay me, yet will I tru&s;t in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. He al&s;o &s;hall be my &s;alvation. My righteou&s;ne&s;s I hold fa&s;t, and will not let it go: my heart &s;hall not reproach me &s;o long as I live.' (See Job, xix. 25, 26, 27. xxiii. 10, 11, 12. xiii. 15, 16. xxvii. 6.) And who could make &s;uch a &s;olemn prote&s;tation of his inno|cence and uprightne&s;s, before God and man, as we find in the xxix. xxx. xxxi. chapters of that book. If &s;uch a man had rea&s;on to &s;ay, 'Where|fore, then, ha&s;t thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh! that I had given up the gho&s;t, and no eye had &s;een me! I &s;hould have been as though I had not been; I &s;hould have been carried from the womb to the grave,' (See Job x. 18, 19.) with what amazing propriety might Chri&s;t &s;ay of Judas, the traitor, who &s;inned in &s;uch a dreadful manner, and had &s;uch horrible guilt on his con&s;cience: who died in black de&s;pair, peri&s;hed in &s;uch an aw|ful &s;ituation, in his &s;ins, and, probably, by his own hands: who &s;uffered the mo&s;t violent agitations of mind, died under the power of the horrid &s;ugge&s;|tions of the great enemy of men, without one &s;mile, or look of forgivene&s;s, from Je&s;us, or even daring to &s;eek it; who&s;e &s;orrow in this life far exceeded Job's, (for Job had no &s;en&s;e of guilt, trea&s;on, and ingratitude; nor was he filled with rage, bla&s;phe|my, and de&s;pair)&mdash;and who mu&s;t probably have his portion in the &s;econd death;&mdash;'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born! even up|on

on the &s;uppo&s;ition that his torments are not de|&s;igned to continue <HI>while God exi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Jeremiah is another in&s;tance much to my pur|po&s;e; who wi&s;hed that he had never been born, even at the very time when he knew the Lord was his helper; only becau&s;e he had been put in the &s;tocks by Pa&s;hur, and had &s;uffered a little pain and &s;hame in a good cau&s;e. He was not afraid of <HI>end|le&s;s damnation,</HI> nor yet of any future puni&s;hment: for he thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, in all the language of full a&s;&s;urance; 'But JEHOVAH is with me, as a mighty terrible One: therefore, my per&s;ecut|ors &s;hall &s;tumble, and they &s;hall not prevail; they &s;hall be greatly a&s;hamed, for they &s;hall not pro&s;per; their everla&s;ting confu&s;ion &s;hall never be forgotten. But, O JEHOVAH of Ho&s;ts, that trie&s;t the righteous, and &s;ee&s;t the reins and the heart, let me &s;ee thy vengeance on them (<HI>or,</HI> thou wilt let me &s;ee, &amp;c.) for unto thee have I opened my cau&s;e. Sing unto JEHOVAH, prai&s;e ye JEHO|VAH: for he hath delivered the &s;oul of the poor from the hand of evil doers. How &s;trong his faith! how full his a&s;&s;urance! Yet it is evident, that he thought it would have been much better for him, per&s;onally, never to have been born; for he immediately adds, 'Cur&s;ed be the day wherein I was born; let not the day wherein my mother bare me, be ble&s;&s;ed. Cur&s;ed be the man who brought tidings to my father, &s;aying, A man child is born unto thee, making him very glad. And let that man be as the cities which JEHOVAH overthrew, and repented not: And let him hear the cry in the morning, and the &s;houting at noon|tide; becau&s;e he &s;lew me not from the womb: or that my mother might have been my grave: and

her womb to be always great with me. Where|fore came I out of the womb, to &s;ee labour and &s;orrow, that my days &s;hould be con&s;umed with &s;hame?' See Jer. xx. 11-18.</P>
<P>Here is not a word about a &s;tate of future pu|ni&s;hment, much le&s;s <HI>endle&s;s damnation,</HI> and yet the good prophet Jeremiah thought, that if he had never been born, it would have been far better for him.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I never before con&s;idered it po&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer this objection; you have done much towards &s;olving it: but you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that both Job and Jeremiah pa&s;&s;ionately exclaimed, and, through &s;orrow, uttered &s;uch ra&s;h words, as, in their cooler moments, they repented of; and therefore, what they &s;pake of them&s;elves cannot wholly &s;et a&s;ide the objection. Had they deliver|ed tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions as general truths, and declared, that men had much better never have been born, than to have &s;uffered &s;uch degrees of worldly &s;or|row, it would have more than an&s;wered the objec|tion; but, when men under grief exclaim in &s;uch a manner, we cannot ground a matter of &s;uch im|portance upon what they &s;ay re&s;pecting them&s;elves; as their minds, being overwhelmed with trouble, and the immediate &s;en&s;ations of pain, are bia&s;&s;ed, and cannot utter the calm dictates of &s;ober rea&s;on.

<P>We do not find that Job or Jeremiah ever recanted, in their cooler moments, what they uttered in their &s;orrows; and our Lord, &s;peaking of the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, &s;ays, 'And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give &s;uck in tho&s;e days,' See St. Matth. xxiv. 19. St. Mark, xiii. 17. Not becau&s;e of their future, endle&s;s damnation, in di&s;tinction from others; but on account of their pre&s;ent trouble and &s;orrow; as is explained, Luke xxi. 23. 'But, woe to them that are with child, and to them that give &s;uch, in tho&s;e days: for there &s;hall be great di&s;tre&s;s in the land, and wrath upon this people.' And when the Saviour was led to death, we read, 'And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who al&s;o bewailed and lamented him. But Je&s;us, turning unto them, &s;aid, Daughters of Jeru&s;alem, weep not for me, but for your&s;elves, and for your children. For behold the days are coming, in the which they &s;hall &s;ay, Ble&s;&s;ed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave &s;uck. Then &s;hall they &s;ay to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. For if they do the&s;e things in a green tree, what &s;hall be done in the dry?' St. Luke, xxiii. 27&mdash;31.</P>
<P>And who would not, a thou&s;and times, choo&s;e rather never to have been born, than even to &s;ee, far le&s;s experience, the mi&s;eries which came upon Jeru&s;alem and its inhabitants?

But Solomon not only repre&s;ents a &s;tate of great mi&s;ery and affliction in this life, as wor&s;e than not to have been born, but al&s;o, a &s;tate of the greate&s;t pro&s;perity, if it ends in di&s;grace; for he &s;ays, 'If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, &s;o that the days of his years be many, and his &s;oul be not filled with good; and al&s;o, that he have no burial; I &s;ay, that an untimely birth is better than he. For he (the untimely birth) cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkne&s;s; and his name &s;hall be covered with darkne&s;s. Moreover, he hath not &s;een the &s;un, nor known any thing: this hath more re&s;t than the other. Yea, though he live a thou&s;and years twice told, yet hath he &s;een no good:' (<HI>i. e.</HI> no equivalent good, to balance his di&s;grace). 'Do not all go to one place?' All came from du&s;t, and turn to du&s;t again. See Eccle&s;. vi. 3, 4, 5, 6.</P>
<P>The &s;tate here de&s;cribed by Solomon, is not only infinitely better than the damnation of hell, though limited by certain periods; but far preferable to many, if not to mo&s;t &s;ituations of men in this life: and yet he prefers an untimely birth to a man who lives more than twice the age of Methu&s;elah, and has an hundred children of his own, if he has not his &s;oul filled or &s;atisfied with good; and that he hath no burial, or has not honour, (credit, <HI>or</HI> re|putation) at his death.</P>
<P><HI>Long life</HI> and <HI>many children,</HI> were formerly e&s;|teemed as the greate&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings: but as the things of this life cannot fill the &s;oul with good; &s;o a man had better never have been born, than to have enjoyed the good things of this world in the greate&s;t profu&s;ion, if he dies in di&s;grace, and has no burial, or is not honoured at his death. Yet,
<PB N="89" REF="025050_0145_102D765A0007C448">
this is not worthy to be named in the &s;ame day with the damnation of hell; yet, is frequently threatened as a great and terrible judgment; which, if it falls upon a man, however he may have en|joyed long life, health, wealth, and all kinds of pro&s;perity; it makes it wor&s;e for him than if he had never been born, according to the deci&s;ion of God him&s;elf; and, therefore, no wonder that Chri&s;t &s;aid of wicked Judas; 'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born.'</P>
<P>Though I have an&s;wered you &s;o largely, yet one word might have &s;ufficed to have an&s;wered the whole objection at fir&s;t; <HI>viz.</HI> Had Judas died be|fore he had been born, and peri&s;hed from his mo|ther's womb, he would never have &s;inned, far le&s;s betrayed Chri&s;t; he would have entered into peace immediately, 'where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and where the weary are at re&s;t:' In that ca&s;e, he would have e&s;caped the judgment that came upon him, and would have had more re&s;t than tho&s;e who &s;hould live in all the affluence of life two thou&s;and years, and beget each an hun|dred children, and yet &s;hould not be honoured at their death.</P>
<P>Some would have an&s;wered the objection &s;hort|er, by &s;aying, Chri&s;t promi&s;ed twelve thrones to his twelve apo&s;tles, among whom Judas was one; and therefore, he mu&s;t be re&s;tored, or the promi&s;e cannot be fulfilled: See St. Matth. xix. 28. But this I do not in&s;i&s;t upon; neverthele&s;s, tho&s;e who an&s;wer the objection this way, make an ob&s;erva|tion that may be worth attention; <HI>viz.</HI> that Peter, &s;peaking of Judas, &s;aith, 'Let his habitation be de|&s;olate, and let no man dwell therein;' that is, Let
<PB N="90" REF="025050_0146_102D768ABB145420">
his man&s;ion be re&s;erved for him, let no man take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; but 'His bi&s;hopric, or office, let another take.' See Acts, i. 20. compared with P&s;al. lxix. 25. cix. 8. But I am rather of opinion that the de&s;olation of the habitation of the wicked, and the want of inhabitants in their tents, re&s;pects this &s;tate, and is part of the cur&s;e pronounced up|on all traitors; and may therefore in an eminent &s;en&s;e, be applied to Judas, and al&s;o to the rebel|lious nation of the Jews at large; and therefore, as the&s;e words do not intend their Re&s;toration, &s;o neither are they any objection to it; for St. Paul applies part of the lxixth P&s;alm to the Jews, as truly as St. Peter applies it to Judas: See Rom. x. 9, 10. And yet he &s;ays, 'I &s;ay then, Have they &s;tumbled, that they &s;hould fall? God forbid: But rather, through their fall, &s;alvation is come unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealou&s;y. Now, if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the dimini&s;hing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulne&s;s?' And thus, form the 11th ver&s;e to the end of the chap|ter, goes on to &s;peak of their being again received, reconciled, and grafted again into their own olive tree; and that their blindne&s;s is only for a time: 'And &s;o all I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved: There &s;hall come out of Sion a deliverer, and &s;hall turn away un|godline&s;s form Jacob:' That God's covenant, or promi&s;e, is to take their &s;ins away; that they are beloved for the fathers &s;akes; that the gifts and calling of God are without repentance; that, therefore, they &s;hall obtain mercy at la&s;t; and that, for this very purpo&s;e, God hath concluded them all (<HI>or</HI> &s;hut them up) in unbelief, that he might
<PB N="91" REF="025050_0147_102D765BCB547B70">
not only puni&s;h them thereby for their tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, and al&s;o, through their unbelief, cau&s;e the the Gentiles to obtain mercy and &s;alvation; but al&s;o, that he might have mercy upon all tho&s;e whom he had thus &s;hut up in unbelief, without exception. See the whole chapter.</P>
<P>Here, then, are three de&s;igns, worthy of a God of infinite wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s, in this one dark di&s;pen&s;ation, the rejection of the Jewi&s;h church and nation:&mdash;1. That he might puni&s;h them for their iniquity:&mdash;2. That others might come in their room, &s;tand in their office, and be made partakers of their privileges: and 3. That they might be re&s;erved to mercy and forgivene&s;s at la&s;t. And what happened to a whole nation of traitors, might happen to an individual of that na|tion; and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>One grand objection that is very gene|rally made again&s;t the doctrine of the Re&s;toration<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is, that it tends to <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> that it is the doc|trine that the &s;erpent preached to Eve; for we read, (Gen. iii. 4.) 'And the &s;erpent &s;aid unto the woman, Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die:' and that it is a doctrine calculated to give encouragement to the wicked to continue in their evil ways; that it is '&s;aying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace;' and that this doctrine is as dangerous as that of the wicked prophete&s;&s;es of Ezekiel's time, of whom GOD &s;ays, 'With lies ye have made the heart of the righteous &s;ad, whom I have not made &s;ad; and &s;trengthened the hands of the wicked, that he
<PB N="94" REF="025050_0150_102D768E51D4C9F0">
&s;hould not return from his wicked way, by pro|mi&s;ing him life. They &s;ay unto them that de&s;pi&s;e me, JEHOVAH hath &s;aid, Ye &s;hall have peace; and they &s;ay unto every one that walketh after the imagina|tion of his own heart, No evil &s;hall come upon you,' Jer. viii. 11. Ezek. xiii. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Jer. xxiii. 17.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that it is the nature of God to lay the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible re&s;traint upon &s;in, and, therefore, he has threatened it with eternal, or <HI>endle&s;s</HI> puni&s;h|ment: and this is even found too weak to prevent the prevailing of iniquity. What a flood of im|piety, therefore, would overflow the world, if it &s;hould be generally believed, that after &s;ome ages of &s;uffering, mankind &s;hould be re&s;tored to &s;ome degree of happine&s;s? Would not the re&s;traints be wholly taken off from the lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of the wicked, if once this doctrine &s;hould become pre|valent? Will you be &s;o kind as to give a fair and candid reply to this objection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>This objection is &s;tated with all po&s;&s;i|ble force, I &s;hall, therefore endeavour to an&s;wer it as well as I can; putting in this caveat, that if I &s;hould not an&s;wer it to your &s;atisfaction, do not imagine that no &s;olid an&s;wer can be given; but im|pute it to my not being &s;ufficiently ma&s;ter of my &s;ubject, or not being able to expre&s;s my mind &s;o clearly as I could wi&s;h. As this objection is fre|quently made, and often u&s;ed, by people who mean well, but have not con&s;idered the &s;ubject thoroughly, I &s;hall be as explicit as po&s;&s;ibly I can upon it.</P>
<P>I would fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that the great truths, or fir&s;t principles, upon which the Re&s;toration is founded, and form which it is derived by natural and ea&s;y con&s;equences, are far from tending to li|centiou&s;ne&s;s:
<PB N="95" REF="025050_0151_102D76BD1825CEF8">
But, in order to make this evident, it will be proper here to &s;et them down in their order.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t Principles, upon which the Doctrine of the final and univer&s;al Re&s;titution is founded.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. GOD <HI>is the univer&s;al and only creator of all:</HI> contrary to the opinion of the <HI>Manichees</HI> of old, who believed the <HI>devil</HI> to be the creator of mo&s;t, if not all vi&s;ible beings: The <HI>Mugglet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nians,</HI> of the la&s;t century, and the <HI>Buchanit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> lately, a&s;&s;ert nearly the &s;ame &s;entiments; contrary to Rev. iv. 11. Col. i. 16. P&s;al. c. 3. Numb. xvi. 22. I&s;ai. lxiv. 8. Ezek. xviii. 4. Zech. xii. 1. and a va&s;t number of other Scriptures.</P>
<P>Now, who can &s;ay, that this noble thought, which St. Paul enlarges upon &s;o beautifully, (Acts, xvii. 24&mdash;30.) tends, in the lea&s;t, to make men wicked? Does it not tend to dignify and en|noble human nature, to be told, that GOD is our Father, Creator and Fir&s;t Cau&s;e; and that we were made by his power, according to his will, and for his plea&s;ure; and that the <HI>chief end</HI> for which he made us, was, <HI>to glorify his name, and to enjoy him for ever?</HI>&mdash;as the A&s;&s;embly's Catechi&s;m beautifully declares. This is one of the principles from which GOD him&s;elf deduces the certainty of the final end of wrath, as I have ob&s;erved before:&mdash;'For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the &s;pirit &s;hould fail before me, and the &s;ouls which I have made,' I&s;ai. lvii. 16.&mdash;Tho&s;e who venture to contradict their Maker, and &s;ay, that he <HI>will contend for ever, and be always wroth;</HI> ought to be able, at lea&s;t, to give as good
<PB N="96" REF="025050_0152_102D7690C1C63D28">
a rea&s;on why <HI>he will,</HI> as he has a&s;&s;igned why <HI>he will not;</HI> and con&s;equently prove, that he hath <HI>not made all &s;ouls;</HI> which is the true founda|tion upon which endle&s;s mi&s;ery mu&s;t be founded, and the only doctrine which is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with it.</P>
<P>The poor untutored <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> argued (with a mi&s;&s;ionary that was &s;ent from <HI>Sweden</HI> to convert them) from the univer&s;al providence of GOD, that he, who was &s;o kind a Father as to pro|vide for their bodies all things needful, had not wholly neglected their &s;ouls: But this I do not in&s;i&s;t upon, though, I think, the argument has weight in it; and, certainly, the providential good|ne&s;s of GOD, and his long-&s;uffering, tends to lead men to repentance: Rom. ii. 4. 2 Pet. iii. 9.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The univer&s;al benevolence of the Deity,</HI> or the <HI>love</HI> of GOD to his creatures, is one of the fir&s;t principles from which the general Re&s;toration is deduced: and who can &s;ay, that this leads to li|centiou&s;ne&s;s? If tho&s;e who believe that GOD loves them, in particular, find <HI>that</HI> con&s;ideration the &s;tronge&s;t obligation on them to love him again, and to obey his will; by the &s;ame rule, if all the in|dividuals of the whole human race, were to be|lieve that GOD loved each one of them, would not the &s;ame cau&s;e produce the &s;ame effect? And if &s;o, can this be charged as a licentious doctrine, which is expre&s;sly grounded upon a cau&s;e which power|fully operates to produce holine&s;s? Is there any thing like argument in this rea&s;oning: I know that GOD loves me, and &s;eeks to do me good; there|fore, I mu&s;t hate him. What &s;hould we think of a woman who &s;hould leave her hu&s;band, and do all in her power again&s;t him, and &s;hould be able
<PB N="97" REF="025050_0153_102D76BF296657C8">
to give no better rea&s;on for it than the following: My hu&s;band loves me, and I know it, and he has always loved me, and always will; and, therefore, I am determined to hate, ridicule, de&s;pi&s;e, and con|temn him, and have left him for this very cau&s;e, and am determined never to love or obey him more? Bad as human nature is, I que&s;tion whe|ther &s;uch in&s;tances often occur. We commonly &s;ay, that love begets love: 'We love him, becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved as;' &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, 1 John, iv. 19. Therefore, the doctrine of GOD'S univer&s;al <HI>benevo|lence,</HI> cannot lead to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, in any light in which it can be viewed; for, if he really loves us, he will do all in his power to bring us to love him again, and to be like him; and I am &s;ure, the con|&s;ideration of his love to us, goes as far as moral &s;ua&s;ion can go, to induce us to love him again, nay, the belief of it is acknowledged to be one of the &s;tronge&s;t motives to obedience; and the love of GOD, &s;hed abroad in the heart, produces the be&s;t effects, and is the mo&s;t powerful principle, and &s;pring, of good and virtuous actions, that we are acquainted with. This being a fir&s;t principle, from which the univer&s;al Re&s;toration is concluded, we are happy to find, that 'GOD is love:' and that he '&s;o loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life: For, GOD &s;ent not his Son into the world to condemn the world: but that the world, through him, might be &s;aved,' See 1 John, iv. 16. St. John, iii. 16, 17. But it is not &s;o much my bu&s;ine&s;s now to &s;hew, that the &s;entiment is &s;criptural, as to &s;hew that it is not of a dangerous tendency. The fol|lowing words, however, are &s;o beautiful, that I
<PB N="98" REF="025050_0154_102D769251B58220">
take the liberty to mention them:&mdash;'But thou ha&s;t mercy upon all; for thou can&s;t do all things, and winke&s;t at the &s;ins of men, becau&s;e they &s;hould amend. For thou love&s;t all the things that are, and abhorre&s;t nothing which thou ha&s;t made: for never woulde&s;t thou have made any thing, if thou had&s;t hated it, And how could any thing have endured, if it had not been thy will: or been pre|&s;erved, if not called by thee? But thou &s;pare&s;t all; for they are thine, O Lord, thou lover of &s;ouls. For thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things: There|fore cha&s;tene&s;t thou them, by little and little, that offend, and warne&s;t them, by putting them in re|membrance wherein they have offended, that leav|ing their wickedne&s;s, they may believe on thee, O LORD. For thy power is the beginning of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s; and becau&s;e thou art the LORD of all, it maketh thee to be gracious unto all. But thou, O GOD, art gracious and true: long-&s;uffering, and in mercy ordering all things. For if we &s;in, we are thine, knowing thy power; but <HI>we will not &s;in,</HI> knowing that we are counted thine:' Wi&s;dom of Solomon, xi. 23&mdash;26. xii. 1, 2, 16. xv. 1, 2. 'JEHOVAH is gracious and full of compa&s;&s;ion, &s;low to anger, and of great mercy. JEHOVAH is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. All thy works &s;hall prai&s;e thee, O JEHO|VAH; and thy &s;aints &s;hall ble&s;s thee,' P&s;al. cxlv. 8, 9, 10.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another great principle, upon which the Re&s;toration depends, is, <HI>that</HI> CHRIST <HI>died for all;</HI> 'We &s;ee <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who was made a little lower than the angels, for the &s;uffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he, by the grace of GOD, &s;hould ta&s;te death for <HI>every man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>(<HI>or</HI> ALL)

Heb. ii. 9. 'If <HI>any man</HI> &s;in, we have an Advo|cate with the <HI>Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our &s;ins; and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the <HI>whole world,'</HI> 1 John, ii. 1, 2.

<P>I need not multiply pa&s;&s;ages to prove that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> died for <HI>all;</HI> for though the univer&s;ality of his <HI>death</HI> is not expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted, in every text where it is mentioned that he died, it mu&s;t always be under|&s;tood; becau&s;e it is never denied in any place, and is plainly, and pointedly declared in tho&s;e which I have quoted: And, be&s;ides, it is evident that in the apo&s;tles time, the <HI>univer&s;ality</HI> of the death of Chri&s;t was a fir&s;t principle, univer&s;ally acknow|ledged, and, therefore, St. Paul rea&s;ons from it as &s;uch; which it would have been highly prepo&s;|terous for him to do, if that had not been the ca&s;e: As, for example, 'For the love of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> con|&s;traineth us; becau&s;e we thus judge, that if one died for <HI>all,'</HI> (which is not di&s;puted by any, and which we know to be a truth) 'then were <HI>all</HI> dead: And that he died for <HI>all;</HI> that they who live, &s;hould not henceforth live unto them&s;elves, but unto him that died for them, and ro&s;e again,' 2 Cor. v. 14, 15.</P>

<P>But have you never heard it argued that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did not <HI>die</HI> for <HI>all,</HI> becau&s;e he did not <HI>pray</HI> for <HI>all?</HI></P>

<P>I remember, when a lad, I was &s;eat to a neighbour's hou&s;e, and overheard the good man, the ma&s;ter of the family, read in a book, after this manner: <HI>'Chri&s;t</HI> did not die for <HI>all,</HI> becau&s;e

he did not pray for <HI>all:</HI> I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them which thou ha&s;t given me, for they are thine,' St. John, xvii. 9. And I then thought the argument conclu&s;ive: But I am now at a lo&s;s whether the author of that book meant to deceive his readers; or, whether he had never read the chapter through critically: for, had he read the 20th ver&s;e, he would have found the&s;e words, which would have overthrown his hypothe&s;is:&mdash;'Neither pray I for the&s;e <HI>alone;</HI> but for them <HI>al&s;o,</HI> who &s;hall believe on me through their word.' If <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had prayed for all, in the 9th ver&s;e, for whom he died, he could not have enlarged his prayer &s;o much in the 20th ver&s;e, as to take in not them only, but all that &s;hould be|lieve on him through the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> word: Neither does he &s;top here, but goes on to pray for tho&s;e that believe, in the&s;e words: 'That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they al&s;o may be one in us:' And, why is all this uni|ty prayed for among believers?

<P>When all that believe &s;hall be <HI>one,</HI> as the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son</HI> are <HI>one:</HI> When the great marriage of the <HI>Lamb</HI> &s;hall be celebrated, and his

<P>This was the &s;tate that St. Paul be&s;ought the Corinthians to pre&s;s after, and wi&s;hed them to at|tain; but he had the mortification to &s;ee them fall &s;hort of it, as all the Chri&s;tian churches have, from that day to this. But when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall give that glory and honour to his Bride, which the <HI>Father</HI> gave to him, and &s;hall thus unite her to him&s;elf, in an indi&s;&s;oluble union, and the &s;everal members of his body, the Church, &s;hall be as much united one to another, as the members of the natural body are; or, to expre&s;s it in his own words, 'As thou, <HI>Father,</HI> art in <HI>me,</HI> and <HI>I</HI> in <HI>thee;'</HI> When thus the Church &s;hall be one, in &s;pirit, love, de|&s;ign, judgment, &amp;c. as the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Son</HI> are; then &s;hall the <HI>world believe,</HI> and believing, have life; then &s;hall the <HI>world know</HI> him, whom to know is life eternal: See ver&s;es 2 and 3, But as this great <HI>cau&s;e</HI> has never yet exi&s;ted, the <HI>effect</HI> has not yet followed; but when the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;hall be, the <HI>la&s;t</HI> &s;hall take place in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The petitions in that mo&s;t excellent prayer, that may, with great propriety, be called the LORD'S Prayer, may be divided into four cla&s;&s;es: 1. For him&s;elf, ver&s;es 1&s;t and 5th: 2. For his apo&s;tles, 9&mdash;19: 3. For them that &s;hould believe, through

<P>Proceed, if you plea&s;e, to &s;hew, that the doctrine of the <HI>univer&s;ality</HI> of the death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> does not lead to licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is evident that it doth not; but, on the contrary, it is the &s;tronge&s;t motive to all who believe it, to love and live to him who died for them, and ro&s;e again : We <HI>are not our own, but are bought with a price;</HI> therefore, we are exhorted not to be the &s;ervants of &s;in, &s;laves to our pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ervants to men: but to glorify GOD in our bo|dies and &s;prits, which are his: and the apo&s;tle be|&s;eeches us, by the mercies of GOD, to pre&s;ent our bodies a living &s;acrifice, holy, acceptable unto GOD; which is our rea&s;onable &s;ervice. Fora&s;|much, as we know that we were not redeemed with corruptible things, as &s;ilver and gold; but with the precious blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as of a <HI>Lamb</HI> without blemi&s;h, and without &s;pot; See 2 Cor. v. 15, Rom. vi. 12, 13. 1 Cor. vii. 23. vi. 19, 20. Rom. xii. 1. 1 Peter, i. 18, 19.</P>
<P>What a horrid thought would it be, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould be the mini&s;ter of &s;in, and that his blood-&s;hedding &s;hould cau&s;e wickedne&s;s to abound? The love of GOD, in giving his <HI>Son</HI> to die, is enough to move an heart of &s;tone; 'For when we were yet without &s;trength, in due time, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> died for the ungodly: for, &s;carcely for a righte|ous man will one die; yet, peradventure, for a good (kind, benevolent, generous) man, &s;ome would even dare to die. But GOD commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet
<PB N="103" REF="025050_0159_102D76C44C7B6F40">
&s;inners, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> died for us. Much more, being now ju&s;tified through his blood, we &s;hall be &s;aved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to GOD by the death of his <HI>Son;</HI> much more, being reconciled, we &s;hall be &s;aved by his life,' Rom. v. 6&mdash;10.</P>
<P>Here the death of the <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> is laid as the ground, and the &s;alvation of men inferred from it, with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible certainty; yet, will any one &s;ay, that becau&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath died for him, therefore he will indulge him&s;elf in &s;in? God for|bid. Some &s;ay that if they believed this doctrine, they would live in &s;in, and indulge them&s;elves in their lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions: but then it may be ob|&s;erved, that tho&s;e who &s;ay &s;o are its enemies, and tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the view, and not tho&s;e who receive it.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;o bruti&s;h and unaccounta|ble in &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, as would lead men to hate their be&s;t friends, merely becau&s;e they are &s;o; that would lead them to hate GOD, becau&s;e he loved them; and de&s;pi&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> merely becau&s;e he died for them; that, for the honour of human nature, I would hope, the&s;e in&s;tances are rare. But to the point. I have conver&s;ed with many who believed that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> died for them in particu|lar; and yet I never heard them &s;ay, that they hated him for it; but, on the contrary, that they loved him exceedingly. Now, is not the &s;ame cau&s;e likely to produce the &s;ame effect? If a thou|&s;and per&s;ons, for in&s;tance, all believing that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> died for them, find their hearts con&s;trained to love him for it, would it not have the &s;ame effect upon ten thou&s;and, ten millions, or ten millions of mil|lions? And if it would cau&s;e licentiou&s;ne&s;s to
<PB N="104" REF="025050_0160_102D7697AEB23D28">
abound in the world, to preach that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> died for all, if it was univer&s;ally believed; by the &s;ame rule it mu&s;t cau&s;e it to prevail, in a le&s;&s;er degree, to preach that he died for a &s;mall part, at lea&s;t, a|mong tho&s;e who believe them&s;elves to be of the the number; and, therefore, it mu&s;t not be preach|ed at all, that he died for any? Who can deny the con&s;equence? It &s;eems to be evident, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has done and &s;uffered too much for tho&s;e that he died for, to lo&s;e them finally: and thus the uni|ver&s;al Re&s;toration &s;tands connected nece&s;&s;arily with the univer&s;ality of the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and is de|duced therefrom, in the ea&s;ie&s;t manner; therefore, the doctrine of the <HI>former</HI> cannot tend to licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s, as it &s;tands upon the ground of the <HI>latter,</HI> which hath been demon&s;trated to have no &s;uch tendency.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another principle upon which the univer&s;al doctrine depends, is, <HI>the unchangeablene&s;s of God:</HI> Whom he loves once, he always loves; he loved his creatures when he made them, as none can well deny; their &s;ins he never loved, nor ever will; he hath declared, that he loved us when &s;inners, but never <HI>as</HI> &s;inners. His eternal and con&s;tant hatred of all &s;in, and his unchangeable love of all his creatures, are of the nature of pri|mary truths; from which the doctrine of the ge|neral Re&s;toration may be ea&s;ily and plainly infer|red. In this view we may under&s;tand tho&s;e ma|ny dreadful threatenings and gracious promi&s;es, made to the &s;ame people and per&s;ons: Both &s;hall be fulfilled; the fir&s;t, while they continue as rebels, which are de&s;igned to humble and &s;ubdue them; the la&s;t, when they &s;hall have accepted of the puni&s;hment of their iniquity; when their
<PB N="105" REF="025050_0161_102D76C6A072EE38">
uncircumci&s;ed hearts are humbled, when their &s;tubborn knees &s;hall bow to JEHOVAH, and their former rebellious tongues &s;hall &s;wear allegiance to him.</P>
<P>Does this idea lead to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, that GOD hates &s;in, and determines to pur&s;ue it to entire de|&s;truction, and never to put up his &s;word, &s;o long as there is a rebel in the univer&s;e; yet, at the &s;ame time, has no po&s;itive hatred to the &s;ouls which he has made, but only wi&s;hes them to return to or|der?&mdash;This idea appears to me, equally to check pre&s;umption and de&s;pair; and tends to put an end to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, rather than to encourage it: For, if rebels are a&s;&s;ured that their rightful &s;ove|reign hates them, and will never &s;uffer them to be reconciled to him, it naturally cau&s;es them to fight with tenfold rage, as all warriors will te&s;tify; as, on the other hand, if they believe he is too weak, or undetermined, to conquer them, they will be pre&s;umptuous, and continue the war. It cannot, therefore, be affirmed, by any per&s;ons of rea&s;on, that the declaration that GOD will de&s;troy &s;in, tends to promote it; or, that his love of order, and hatred of evil, being compatible with his love to the creatures he has made, is a doctrine that encourages men to rebel; the contrary is evi|dent: and yet the&s;e are the very grounds of the univer&s;al Re&s;toration; which cannot, therefore, be licentious.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another of the fir&s;t principles of the Re&s;tora|tion, is, the <HI>immutability of</HI> GOD'S <HI>coun&s;els;</HI> which he hath confirmed by an oath, 'That by two im|mutable things, (<HI>viz.</HI> his word and oath) in which it was impo&s;&s;ible for GOD to lie, we might have a &s;trong con&s;olation, who have fled for refuge, to
<PB N="106" REF="025050_0162_102D76997947D568">
lay hold upon the hope &s;et before us,' Heb. vi. 17, 18. 'God hath abounded towards us in all wi&s;dom and prudence, having made known unto us the my&s;tery of his will, according to his good plea&s;ure, which he hath purpo&s;ed in him&s;elf. That in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, he might gather together (<HI>or</HI> rehead) in one, all things in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> both which are in heaven, and which are on earth: even in him: in whom we have obtained an inheritance, being prede&s;tinated according to the purpo&s;e of him who worketh <HI>all things</HI> according to the coun&s;el of his own WILL,' Ephe&s;. i. 8, 9, 10, 11. GOD is our Saviour, (<HI>or Soteros,</HI> Re&s;torer) who will have all men to be &s;aved, (<HI>&s;othenai,</HI> re&s;tored) and to come unto the knowledge of the truth,' 1 Tim. ii. 3, 4. This is the will and coun&s;el of that GOD, who 'doeth according to his will in the armies of heaven, and and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, What doe&s;t thou?' Dan. iv. 35. He hath &s;worn by him&s;elf, the word is gone out of his mouth in righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hall not return, that unto him 'every knee &s;hall bow, every tongue &s;hall &s;wear,' I&s;ai. xlv. 23. The coun&s;el of GOD &s;hall &s;tand; he will perform his plea&s;ure, notwith&s;tanding all the oppo&s;ition that men can make: 'GOD is not a man, that he &s;hould lie, neither the &s;on of man, that he &s;hould repent: Hath he &s;aid, and &s;hall he not do it? or, hath he &s;poken, and &s;hall he not make it good?' Numb, xxiii. 19. If GOD will have all men to be &s;aved, or re&s;tored, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, if it is his good plea|&s;ure, which he hath purpo&s;ed in him&s;elf, in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, to rehead all
<PB N="107" REF="025050_0163_102D76C8A466F458">
things in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> both in heaven and on earth; if he hath &s;worn, that unto him every knee &s;hall bow, and every tongue &s;hall &s;wear; and if he worketh all things after the coun&s;el of his own will, and is determined to perform all his plea&s;ure, which he is able to do; and with him nothing that he plea&s;es is impo&s;&s;ible: I &s;ay, if all the&s;e things are true, (as who, that believes the Scrip|tures, can deny?) then, is not the doctrine of the Re&s;toration true? And who will venture to charge that with licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which GOD, in the coun&s;el of his will, hath purpo&s;ed, and is determined to perform? We know, the will of GOD is a will to all goodne&s;s, and that he cannot do any thing un|ju&s;t, or contrary to his holy nature, or incon&s;i&s;t|ent with his plan of moral government, or that &s;hall tend to promote rebellion; therefore, if GOD had &s;een that this great work had been, in any re|&s;pect, injurious to his perfections, character, go|vernment, &amp;c. he would not have propo&s;ed it; and if he had fore&s;een that the knowledge of it would have been hurtful to mankind, he would not have revealed it: But &s;ince he hath done both, we may certainly argue, that it is not a licentious doctrine to declare, that GOD will finally make all his intelligent creatures happy; by making them all his &s;ubjects, by de&s;troying their &s;ins, and mak|ing them holy, in a way perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with all his perfections and attributes; without doing the lea&s;t injury to his character, or rendering his moral government weak, or making any of his words void, whether threatenings or promi&s;es, or in the lea&s;t &s;etting a&s;ide the &s;anctions of his law or go&s;pel, or a future &s;tate of rewards and pu|ni&s;hments; without derogating at all from the
<PB N="108" REF="025050_0164_102D769B821CA258">
glory of the Mediator, but rather exalting it to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible pitch; without &s;addening the hearts of the righteous, or dimini&s;hing, in the lea&s;t, from the happine&s;s of Heaven, but rather cau&s;ing it to increa&s;e; for if there is joy in Heaven over one &s;inner that repenteth, there mu&s;t be more over many, in exact proportion; and as God will certainly give the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible joy to his cho&s;en, and there is no doubt but it will receive addition from every one that is re&s;tored, or brought home to him&s;elf; therefore, it can only be brought to its highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible pitch by the <HI>univer&s;al Re&s;tora|tion;</HI> which doctrine cannot, therefore, be licenti|ous, as God has appointed and revealed it, and all holy beings (except &s;ome weak good men on earth) rejoice therein exceedingly.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another of the principles on which the <HI>gene|ral Re&s;toration</HI> is founded, is, <HI>that</HI> God <HI>hath given all things into the hand of</HI> Chri&s;t, who hath declar|ed, <HI>that it is the Father's will, that of all that he gave him, he &s;hould lo&s;e nothing:</HI> and that power was giv|en him over all, that he &s;hould give the knowledge of God, even eternal life, to all that the <HI>Father</HI> had given him; and that <HI>all,</HI> without exception, whom the <HI>Father</HI> hath given, &s;hall come in &s;uch a man|ner, as not to be ca&s;t out: But as all the&s;e Scrip|tures have been recited, and rea&s;oned upon before, I &s;hall only now ob&s;erve, that as GOD the FATHER hath given <HI>all</HI> things to CHRIST, and as he hath engaged to bring <HI>all</HI> back, without exception, and hath both <HI>will</HI> and <HI>power</HI> to perform this work, and came into the world on purpo&s;e to accompli&s;h it, it mu&s;t, of con&s;equence, be finally performed; yet, it cannot tend to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, or the God of Heaven, and the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> would never
<PB N="109" REF="025050_0165_102D76CA4E7F1EE0">
have planned it approved of it, or &s;ought to ex|ecute it.</P>
<P>Many more fir&s;t principles, on which the doc|trine of the <HI>Re&s;toration</HI> is founded, might be menti|oned, and &s;hewn to be far from tending to licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s: but I &s;hall mention but one more; and that is&mdash;<HI>The Scriptures mu&s;t be fulfilled; the Scrip|tures cannot be broken:</HI> None or the words of God can fail of being accompli&s;hed; and he hath not only denounced dreadful threatnings, but made many gracious promi&s;es to the &s;ame people: The&s;e cannot be fulfilled together; and, if there is no truth in the Re&s;toration, I cannot &s;ee how the <HI>lat|ter</HI> will ever be fulfilled at all; and if &s;ins are not puni&s;hed in the per&s;ons who commit them, I am equally at a lo&s;s what &s;en&s;e or truth there can be in the <HI>former.</HI> It would be a great ta&s;k to collect all the texts which ju&s;tify the remark, that threatenings and promi&s;es belong to the &s;ame people in differ|ent periods, &s;ome &s;pecimens of which have been given in the cour&s;e of the&s;e dialogues. Now, it cannot lead to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, to &s;uppo&s;e that the Scriptures &s;hall all be fulfilled; but it mu&s;t lead to infidelity, and all kinds of evil, to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the fir&s;t principles upon which the doctrine of the Re&s;toration &s;tands, and by which it is &s;upported; and as the&s;e have all been con&s;ider|ed, and proved to have no tendency to encourage &s;in, &s;eparately, much le&s;s can they have any &s;uch tendency, jointly; and then it evidently follows, that a doctrine which &s;eems nece&s;&s;arily deduced, or inferred by undeniable con&s;equences, from all the&s;e con&s;iderations united, cannot be fal&s;e, or have any evil tendency.</P>

<P>You have brought my own experience to my mind:&mdash;It plea&s;ed GOD, by an incident too trifling to mention, to bring me to &s;eek earne&s;tly for an unfading trea&s;ure; and, by a train of cir|cum&s;tances, fixed the concern deeply upon my mind; and I laboured night and day, but could obtain no re&s;t, till one morning&mdash;a time never to be forgotten!&mdash;as I was walking on a journey, un|der great di&s;tre&s;s, and when deliverance &s;eemed farther from me than ever, all at once, I was brought to re&s;ign my &s;oul into the hands of GOD, and thus I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf: 'Lord, here I am: a poor helple&s;s &s;inner: I re&s;ign my&s;elf into thine hands; take me, and deal with me, ju&s;t as thou plea&s;e&s;t: I know thou can&s;t do me no inju&s;tice.' Immediately the&s;e words came into my mind, with great power and &s;weetne&s;s: 'In an acceptable time have I heard thee; and in a day of &s;alvation have I helped thee,' I&s;ai. xlix. 8. and I had then &s;uch a view of CHRIST, as made me to cry out 'Glory to God in the highe&s;t! This is &s;alvation; I know this is &s;alvation!' Then tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which you have mentioned, came into my mind with great energy; and I &s;aw the fulne&s;s, &s;ufficiency, and wil|lingne&s;s of CHRIST to &s;ave me, and all men, in &s;uch a manner as con&s;trained me to venture my &s;oul into his arms; and if I had had ten thou&s;and &s;ouls, I
<PB N="113" REF="025050_0169_102D76CE7AD2F1D8">
could have tru&s;ted them all in his hands. And, O how did I long, that every &s;oul of Adam's race might come to know the love of God in CHRIST JESUS! And I thought, I could not be willing to live any longer on earth, unle&s;s it might plea&s;e God to make me u&s;eful to my fellow-creatures.
<Q><L>'What peaceful hours I then enjoy'd!</L>
<L>'How &s;weet their mem'ry &s;till!</L>
<L>'But they have left an aching void</L>
<L>'The world can never fill.'</L></Q></P>
<P>This is a little ab&s;tract of what God did then graciou&s;ly teach me by his Spirit; but I had been brought up in the particular &s;y&s;tem, and in the cour&s;e of a few years came to be &s;o firmly attach|ed to it, as to refu&s;e in my preaching, to make ge|neral invitations to mankind at large; rightly rea|&s;oning with my&s;elf, that if provi&s;ion was only made for a &s;mall part, I had no warrant to call or invite the whole to come and partake; and there|fore only pre&s;&s;ed the duty on &s;uch and &s;uch charac|ters, as <HI>hungry, thir&s;ty, weary, heavy-laden,</HI> &s;uch as were <HI>without money, &s;en&s;ible &s;inners,</HI> &amp;c. all of which I concluded to be of the <HI>elect,</HI> becau&s;e I judged the Spirit had begun to operate &s;avingly up|on their hearts; and that to the&s;e, and the&s;e only, the Scriptures directed invitations to be made; ne|ver con&s;idering that text&mdash;'Hearken unto me, ye &s;tout-hearted, that are far from righteou&s;ne&s;s. I bring near my righteou&s;ne&s;s; and it &s;hall not be far off, and my &s;alvation &s;hall not tarry,' I&s;a. xlvi. 12, 13. During the time that I remained in this clo&s;e-hearted &s;y&s;tem, labouring with all my might to maintain it, I chanced to come to a hou&s;e,
<PB N="114" REF="025050_0170_102D76A187A45450">
where, as far as I can judge, was a very &s;en&s;ible and pious young woman, whom I never &s;aw be|fore or &s;ince: She gave a very judicious account of the work of grace upon her heart: but when &s;he came to that part, where &s;he &s;aid &s;he beheld an infinite fulne&s;s in CHRIST for ALL the world, I in|terrupted her, and told her, That could not be; for there was no provi&s;ion made for all, and there|fore it was impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he could have any &s;uch di&s;coveries made to her by the Spirit of God. This I in&s;i&s;ted upon, according to my &s;y&s;tem, contrary to my experimental knowledge; (O the mi&s;chiefs of bigotry, prejudice, and vain attachment to &s;y&s;|tem!) &s;he, on the contrary, maintained, that &s;he clearly viewed matters in that light; and that &s;he certainly was taught to believe, that in Chri&s;t there was a fulne&s;s and freene&s;s for all: This I denied; and &s;he was thereby prevented from fini&s;h|ing what &s;he had begun. I can never forgive my|&s;elf, for the oppo&s;ition I made to what I knew to be truth by experience; and as I did not enquire the name of the per&s;on, I have had no opportunity of making a recantation by letter, as I ought to have done; and having never been in the place &s;ince, and it being highly improbable that ever I &s;hall again, I feel my&s;elf extremely hurt, whenever I think of it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can but admire the agreement between us in matters of experience; for I found the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions of mind that you mentioned, when it plea&s;ed <HI>God</HI> to reveal his <HI>Son</HI> in me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never found an experienced Chri&s;ti|an in my life, but would give much the &s;ame ac|count, provided that his &s;y&s;tem was not in &s;ight; and I have found &s;ome, that though they were vi|olently
<PB N="115" REF="025050_0171_102D76D04817EE10">
attached to the contrary &s;y&s;tem, and knew my intention in a&s;king the que&s;tions; yet an&s;wer|ed the following affirmatively.</P>
<P>Did you not &s;ee and feel your&s;elves the vile&s;t of &s;inners?</P>
<P>Did you not view the love of GOD infinitely full, free and unmerited?</P>
<P>Did you not behold in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> an infinite fulne&s;s, &s;ufficiency, and willingne&s;s, to &s;ave all, without exception?</P>
<P>Did you not love all, and wi&s;h that all might come and partake of his grace?</P>
<P>Did you not earne&s;tly de&s;ire the &s;alvation of all, not only of your family, friends, neighbours, and nation; but al&s;o of your enemies, and of all man|kind? Could you not embrace the whole human race in the arms of benevolence?</P>
<P>Did you not find it in your heart to pray for the &s;alvation of all mankind, as for your own?</P>
<P>If you had as much power as good-will, would you not bring all to bow to the &s;ceptre of grace, and to be reconciled to <HI>God</HI> through <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ee how an experienced per&s;on can refu&s;e to &s;ay Yes, to all the&s;e que&s;tions; they are &s;o agreeable to the very tempers of the new|born &s;oul; and, I am &s;ure, I found them in my heart, at the very time when I fir&s;t ta&s;ted of the love of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, my friend, let me a&s;k you, From whence did the&s;e tempers and di&s;po&s;itions proceed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be candid, I think they were given me from above, and came down from the Father of lights, from whence every good and perfect
<PB N="116" REF="025050_0172_102D76A31679C4D8">
gift cometh; and I am the more apt to think &s;o, becau&s;e I found contrary di&s;po&s;itions in my heart before; and the more I am &s;en&s;ible of the forgiv|ing love of God, the more I find the&s;e affections which you have de&s;cribed, and the&s;e de&s;ires for the good of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let me a&s;k you, Can a &s;mall drop be larger than the unfathomed aby&s;s and ocean of Love? Have you more compa&s;&s;ion towards your fellow-creatures than the God that made them? Can any effect be greater than its cau&s;e? Would you bring all to &s;ubmit to God, and be happy, if you could? and will not he, to whom nothing that he plea&s;es to do is impo&s;&s;ible, bring all his creatures to be reconciled to him&s;elf at la&s;t? He has infinitely more love to his creatures, than all the &s;aints and angels in glory have; he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite power and wi&s;dom, as well as love; all means to accompli&s;h the work are known to him: he can do it in a way that &s;hall cau&s;e his prai&s;e to abound exceedingly, in a way perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with all his perfections, and the whole of his glo|rious character; it is his will and purpo&s;e &s;o to do, as has been proved at large; What, then, can hin|der him from fulfilling it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not able to gain&s;ay this rea&s;oning; it &s;eems almo&s;t undeniable: But can you &s;hew that the doctrine of the Re&s;toration &s;tands connected with practical religion, or the keeping of the com|mandments of God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can very ea&s;ily do that, in every in|&s;tance; but &s;hall only attend to the following, as a &s;pecimen.</P>
<P N="1">1. Our Lord has commanded us to <HI>love all man|kind;</HI> not our brethren and friends only, but even
<PB N="117" REF="025050_0173_102D76D1E90966D0">
our greate&s;t enemies; and all for this purpo&s;e, that we may be the children of our Father, who is in Heaven, who&s;e love is univer&s;al, and who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works: See St. Matth. v. 44&mdash;48. St. Luke, vi. 27&mdash;36. But if God doth not love all him&s;elf, Chri&s;t hath commanded us to be <HI>more perfect,</HI> in that re&s;pect, than our Father, who is in Heaven; which, to &s;uppo&s;e, is highly ab&s;urd. What &s;hall we &s;ay to that doctrine that teaches us, that God hates, with a perfect hatred, many of tho&s;e whom he hath commanded us to love as our&s;elves?</P>
<P>Therefore, there is nothing in the doctrine of the Re&s;toration, contrary to the love of our neigh|bour; which on the contrary is promoted there|by.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are commanded to <HI>do good to all men,</HI> as we have opportunity. This is recommended to us by the example of our heavenly Father, who mak|eth his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and on the good, and &s;endeth rain on the ju&s;t, and on the unju&s;t;' and no per&s;on can &s;ay, that the belief of this doc|trine tends, in the lea&s;t, to hinder us from doing good to all our fellow-creatures; but rather en|courages us &s;o to do, from the con&s;ideration that God loves them all, and does good to all, and is determined to make them all the &s;ubjects of his kingdom at la&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. We are commanded to <HI>forgive all men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es,</HI> and to pray; &s;aying, 'Forgive us our (debts, <HI>or</HI>) tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as we forgive (our debtors, <HI>or</HI>) them that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us;' St. Matth. vi. 12. St. Luke, xi. 4. And our Lord &s;ays, 'For, if ye forgive men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, your heavenly Fa|ther will al&s;o forgive you: But if ye forgive not
<PB N="118" REF="025050_0174_102D76A527A75248">
men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your Father for|give your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es;' St. Matth. vi. 14, 15. See al&s;o, chap. xviii 21&mdash;35. St. Mark, xi. 25, 26. St. Luke, vi. 37.</P>
<P>Now, is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, with any degree of rea&s;on, that our Lord would command us, upon pain of his highe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, to <HI>forgive</HI> tho&s;e whom he hated, and determined to puni&s;h while he &s;hould exi&s;t, without having the lea&s;t de&s;ire or de&s;ign to do them good? Has he promi&s;ed us the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, if we will forgive all men; and will he never forgive them? He that can believe this, let him believe it. However, &s;ince forgiving all men is a plain command, which none can deny; I tru&s;t, no one will venture to &s;ay, that believing the final Re&s;toration of all men, at la&s;t, will have any tendency to make us break this precept of our <HI>Saviour's,</HI> upon which he lays &s;o much &s;tre&s;s; but, I think, the contrary is evident.</P>
<P N="4">4. We are commanded to <HI>pray for all men:</HI> St. Paul &s;ays, 'I exhort, therefore, that, fir&s;t of all, &s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men: For this is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God, our Saviour, (<HI>or</HI> Re&s;torer) who will have all men to be &s;aved, (<HI>or</HI> re&s;tored) and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one Medi|ator between God and men, the man <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time.' This is the great doctrine of the Go&s;pel, the very foundation of Chri&s;tianity:&mdash; 'Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apo&s;tle; (I &s;peak the truth in Chri&s;t, and lie not) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.' The apo&s;tle not only believed, but taught; not only
<PB N="119" REF="025050_0175_102D76D3B58877C0">
taught, but commanded others to teach and preach this great doctrine, of God's being the Saviour, or Re&s;torer, of all men: In this he gloried, &s;ay|ing, 'This is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation. For therefore we both labour and &s;uf|fer reproach, becau&s;e we tru&s;t in the living God, who is the Saviour (<HI>or</HI> Re&s;torer) of all men, &s;pe|cially of tho&s;e that believe. The&s;e things command and teach.'</P>
<P>Upon this grand foundation, St. Paul recom|mends prayer to all men; &s;aying, 'I will there|fore, that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting,' 1 Tim. ii. 1&mdash;8. iv. 9, 10, 11.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, the apo&s;tle recommends prayer for all men: and wills, that men &s;hould pray every where, at all times, and in all places, lifting up holy hands, without <HI>wrath</HI> and <HI>doubting.</HI> How nearly forgiv|ing all men, and praying for all men, &s;tand con|nected! and both are plainly and peremptorily re|commended by our Lord; who &s;ays, 'Love your enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de&s;|pitefully u&s;e you, and per&s;ecute you.'</P>
<P>We are commanded to pray for all men, becau&s;e it is the will of God that all men &s;hould be &s;aved; (<HI>or</HI> re&s;tored) and becau&s;e Chri&s;t hath given him|&s;elf a ran&s;on for all: And we are bid to pray <HI>with|out doubting:</HI> O, what a word is this! May we, ought we, to pray for the &s;alvation of all men, without <HI>doubting?</HI> Surely, God would never have commanded us to do this, unle&s;s it was his pur|po&s;e to re&s;tore all men, in his own time; and no man can &s;ay, that the belief of the Re&s;toration will prevent our praying for all men.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="025050_0176_102D76A7191353A8">
I was once on a journey, and called in at the hou&s;e of one of my former good friends: Several religious per&s;ons were there; and, after &s;ome time, my &s;entiments came to be &s;poken of, and they &s;eemed to wonder how I could embrace the opi|nion, that all men, finally, would be &s;aved! I told them, however many might preach again&s;t it, that no per&s;on, under the influence of the Divine Spi|rit, could pray <HI>again&s;t it;</HI> but, on the contrary, we could pray <HI>for it</HI> in faith, nothing wavering, as God had commanded, and as his Spirit naturally in&s;pired: that no per&s;on could pray God not to &s;ave or re&s;tore all mankind, without being &s;hocked at the bla&s;phemy and impiety of &s;uch a prayer; but that our Lord had &s;aid, that all things what&s;oever we a&s;ked in prayer, believing that we &s;hould re|ceive, &s;hould be granted, let them be things &s;eem|ingly ever &s;o impo&s;&s;ible; that if we a&s;ked any thing according to his will, it &s;hould be done; and that it was his po&s;itive and declared will, that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, (<HI>or</HI> re&s;tored) and come to the knowledge of the truth: that we were ordered to pray for it in faith, without doubting; and, there|fore, it was as evident as the nature of things re|quired, that it would be done; &s;ince God had ne|ver ordered us to pray for any thing that he was not able and willing to do. This, and much more, I &s;aid, and they &s;eemed exceedingly well &s;atisfied; e&s;pecially, when I informed them, that it was through the blood of Chri&s;t, the blood of the co|venant, that the pri&s;oners &s;hould be &s;ent forth out of the pit wherein is no water, and that all &s;hould be re&s;tored through his mediation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you hold that even the damned &s;hall be finally re&s;tored and delivered by the pow|er
<PB N="121" REF="025050_0177_102D76D5B9BC6D10">
of Je&s;us, and through his blood-&s;hedding. I have heard it objected again&s;t your &s;cheme, that it tended to &s;et at nought the whole mediatorial plan, and to depreciate the blood of Je&s;us, which he &s;hed to purge our &s;ins away; though I never ob&s;erved any thing like this in your di&s;cour&s;es, either in pub|lic or in private.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: God forbid that I &s;hould ever &s;et a&s;ide the blood that clean&s;eth from all &s;in; nor can I be charged with it, unle&s;s having a much higher idea of its merit than my oppo&s;ers, may be looked upon as tending to depreciate it. They hold that it &s;hall clean&s;e a &s;mall number from their &s;ins; I believe that it &s;hall clean&s;e, heal, and re&s;tore the whole human race. They believe that its virtue endures for a little &s;ea&s;on; I maintain that it &s;hall continue to all ages, until all evil &s;hall be de&s;troy|ed out of the univer&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;atisfied that you do not mean to &s;et at nought the powerful blood of the dear Re|deemer, but on the contrary, you &s;uppo&s;e that your views tend more to exalt it. Pray proceed in your di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I need not &s;ay much more upon this matter; Our <HI>Saviour</HI> has &s;aid, 'If any man will do his (the Father's) will, he &s;hall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I &s;peak of my&s;elf,' St. John vii. 17. This is the &s;ure&s;t rule: practi&s;e religion; love, revere, and &s;erve God; love all men, even your enemies; do good to all, forgive all, and pray for all; and then a&s;k, Is the doctrine of the final Re&s;toration con|trary to this manner of life? If it be, reject it; for the&s;e commands are plain: and if the&s;e princi|ples are incon&s;i&s;tent with the ob&s;ervation of the&s;e
<PB N="122" REF="025050_0178_102D76A8E43103C0">
precepts, then avoid them, as you would death and hell. But, I tru&s;t, it has been &s;hewn, that they have no &s;uch tendency; but the contrary. For in&s;tance, Does this doctrine tend to make us hate God, and his character? Does it naturally fill our minds with <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> and prevent <HI>benevo|lence</HI> from ruling within us? Does it fill us with <HI>pride,</HI> and cau&s;e us to look down with contempt upon tho&s;e that are beneath us in life; and bani&s;h <HI>humility</HI> from our hearts? Does the belief of this, cau&s;e our brea&s;ts to &s;well with pale <HI>envy,</HI> and ran|corous malice, at the happine&s;s of others? Does it cau&s;e us to burn with helli&s;h <HI>rage,</HI> fury, and madne&s;s, again&s;t mankind? Does it tend to de&s;troy <HI>meekne&s;s,</HI> and increa&s;e <HI>wrath?</HI> If the&s;e que&s;tions require (either from the nature of things, or from known facts) the an&s;wers to be in the affirmative; then I would abhor &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, and wi&s;h it to be univer&s;ally dete&s;ted: But if, on the contrary, the candid enquirer mu&s;t an&s;wer in the negative, and &s;ay, That the doctrine of the final Re&s;toration does not tend to produce <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, envy, pride,</HI> or <HI>wrath;</HI> but, on the contrary, 'Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good-will towards men;' that it cau&s;es <HI>benevolence, meekne&s;s, humility, forbearance, forgivene&s;s, charity,</HI> and all <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> to abound and increa&s;e; then it cannot be a licentious doctrine, and is not to be di&s;carded on that ac|count; for it is a maxim with St. John, that 'He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is none occa&s;ion of &s;tumbling in him,' 1 John, ii. 10. That is, he cannot receive, hold, maintain, or do, any thing e&s;&s;entially or materially wrong; and, therefore, can give no ju&s;t occa&s;ion of of|fence: 'For, all the law is fulfilled in one word,
<PB N="123" REF="025050_0179_102D76D787810540">
even in this; Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. For he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou &s;halt not commit adul|tery, Thou &s;halt not kill, Thou &s;halt not &s;teal, Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s, Thou &s;halt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying: Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. Love work|eth no ill to his neighbour: therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law,' Gal. v. 14. Rom. xiii. 8, 9, 10.</P>
<P>But it is not only from rea&s;oning, but from facts, that I am able to prove that the belief of the doc|trine of the univer&s;al Re&s;toration, does not lead men to &s;in. The Tunkers, or German Bapti&s;ts, in Penn&s;ylvania, and the &s;tates adjacent, who take the Scriptures as their only guide, in matters both of faith and practie, have always (as far as I know) received, and univer&s;ally, at pre&s;ent, hold the&s;e &s;entiments: But &s;uch Chri&s;tians I have never &s;een as they are; &s;o aver&s;e are they to all &s;in, and to many things that other Chri&s;tians e&s;teem lawful, that they not only refu&s;e to &s;wear, go to war, &amp;c. but are &s;o afraid of doing any thing contrary to the commands of Chri&s;t, that no temptation would prevail upon them even to &s;ue any per&s;on at law, for either name, character, e&s;tate, or any debt, be it ever &s;o ju&s;t: They are indu&s;trious, &s;ober, tem|perate, kind, charitable people; envying not the great, nor de&s;pi&s;ing the mean: They read much, they &s;ing and pray much, they are con&s;tant attend|ants upon the wor&s;hip of God; their dwelling-hou&s;es are all hou&s;es of prayer: They walk in the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blame|le&s;s both in public and private: They bring up
<PB N="124" REF="025050_0180_102D76AAAA0BF250">
their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; no noi&s;e of rudene&s;s, &s;hamele&s;s mirth, loud, vain laughter, is heard within their doors: The law of kindne&s;s is in their mouths: no &s;ourne&s;s, or moro&s;ene&s;s, di&s;graces their religion; and what|&s;oever they believe their Saviour commands, they practi&s;e, without enquiring or regarding what others do.</P>
<P>I remember the Rev. Morgan Edwards, former|ly mini&s;ter of the Bapti&s;t Church in Philadelphia, once &s;aid to me, 'GOD always will have a vi&s;ible people on earth; and the&s;e are his people at pre|&s;ent, above any other in the world.' And in his Hi&s;tory of the Bapti&s;ts in Penn&s;ylvania, &s;peaking of the&s;e people, he &s;ays: 'General redemption they certainly held, and, withal, general &s;alvation; which tenets (though wrong) are con&s;i&s;tent. In a word, they are meek and pious Chri&s;tians; and have ju&s;tly acquired the character of <HI>The harmle&s;s Tunkers.</HI>'</P>
<P>Thus have I proved that this doctrine is not li|centious; both from the fir&s;t principles on which it is founded, from the nature of experimental and practical religion, and from fats. As to that part of the objection, which &s;uppo&s;es this doc|trine to be the &s;ame that the &s;erpent preached to Eye, &s;aying, 'Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die;' it &s;eems al|mo&s;t unworthy of notice: But as it has been glo|ried in by &s;ome writers, as unan&s;werable, merely becau&s;e it was pa&s;&s;ed over unnoticed, as being nothing to the purpo&s;e; I &s;hall make a few remarks upon it.

<ITEM>1. I &s;ay, that <HI>Satan</HI> was a liar, and GOD was true&punc; For man and woman did <HI>die,</HI> in a <HI>moral</HI> &s;en&s;e, on the very day that they &s;inned; they be|came

dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins; they lo&s;t the di|vine life, and became earthly, &s;en&s;ual, devili&s;h; darkne&s;s in their under&s;tandings, &s;tubbornne&s;s in their wills, and di&s;order in their affections, ren|dered them unfit, unable, and unworthy, to have fellow&s;hip with their God. But do they contradict JEHOVAH, and join with the &s;erpent, who a&s;&s;ert, that JESUS, the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> hath quickened, and is able to quicken, tho&s;e who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins? If &s;o, St. Paul joined with the &s;erpent, in Ephe&s;. ii. 1.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The &s;entence of death was pronounced upon man, even the death of the body, in tho&s;e words: 'In the &s;weat of thy face &s;halt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wa&s;t thou taken: for du&s;t thou art, and unto du&s;t thou &s;halt return,' Gen. iii. 19. But, would it be ju&s;t and right for any one to &s;ay, that tho&s;e who be|lieved the re&s;urrection of the body, contradicted God, and, joining with the &s;erpent, declared, that men &s;hould not die; merely, becau&s;e they a&s;&s;erted, according to the promi&s;es, that they &s;hould ri&s;e again? Would not tho&s;e who preach <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and the re&s;urrection, have a right to look upon it as a vile and wilful &s;lander, if any one &s;hould &s;o mi&s;|repre&s;ent the matter? What! mu&s;t I be accu&s;ed of &s;aying, that no man ever died, becau&s;e I believe and teach, that &s;ome have ri&s;en, and that all &s;hall be rai&s;ed, at la&s;t: when even the very idea of a re&s;urrection, pre&s;uppo&s;es a &s;tate of death?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I confe&s;s, that God has threatened &s;inners with the &s;econd death: but do I &s;ay, that they &s;hall never ta&s;te of the &s;econd death, becau&s;e I declare, that the time will come when it &s;hall ex|i&s;t no more? This is curious rea&s;oning, indeed.</ITEM>

As well may I &s;ay, that no man ever lived on earth, becau&s;e &s;o many have died; that no one &s;leeps in the night, who wakes in the morning; or, that no fi&s;h was ever in the water, that was caught and taken out.</P>
<P>Did St. Paul join with the &s;erpent, when he &s;aid, 'For as in <HI>Adam</HI> all die, even &s;o in CHRIST &s;hall all be made alive?' 1 Cor. xv. 22. Will any &s;uppo&s;e that we affirm, that the dreadful threatenings denounced by God, never were, nor ever will be executed, becau&s;e we declare, that his promi&s;es &s;hall al&s;o be fulfilled? Can any rea&s;ona|ble man &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e Chri&s;t is the Saviour of men, that, therefore, they were not in a lo&s;t con|dition? How ab&s;urd! when he declares, that he came to &s;eek and to &s;ave the lo&s;t!</P>
<P>Thus, though mankind died a moral death, in the day wherein they &s;inned; yet, CHRIST is able to quicken and rai&s;e them up from the &s;ame: and though their bodies die, in con&s;equence of the fall; yet &s;hall he cau&s;e all that are in the graves, to hear his voice, and come forth: and, by the &s;ame rule of arguing, though many &s;hall fall under the power of the &s;econd death, which is threatened to &s;in|ners; yet as he has promi&s;ed to de&s;troy all that bears the name of <HI>death,</HI> their Re&s;toration may be fairly concluded, without either contradicting God, or joining with the &s;erpent. Had the Scriptures, indeed, contained nothing but threatenings of <HI>death,</HI> without any promi&s;es of <HI>&s;alvation, re&s;urrection,</HI> or <HI>re&s;toration;</HI> it would have been pre&s;umptuous for us to have entertained any hopes for the human race, or their deliverance, either from <HI>&s;in, death,</HI> or <HI>hell:</HI> but, &s;ince <HI>promi&s;es</HI> are found, as well as <HI>threatenings,</HI> we mu&s;t not, under pretence or co|lour

of believing the <HI>latter,</HI> reject the <HI>former,</HI> le&s;t we are found contradictors and oppo&s;ers of God; for it is as po&s;&s;ible that we may make him a liar, in refu&s;ing to believe the record he has given of his Son, and his intentions of grace and mercy to|wards mankind, as in di&s;regarding his threatenings, denounced again&s;t them becau&s;e of their &s;ins.</P>
<P>As for this doctrine making the <HI>hearts of the righteous &s;ad whom</HI> GOD <HI>would not have made &s;ad,</HI> nothing can be more contrary to fact; for if it be the will of God to reward and puni&s;h, and finally to re&s;tore mankind, none of the righteous will be &s;orry, but, on the contrary, will greatly rejoice. It is not God's truth, but men's lies, of which the prophet &s;peaks; which made the hearts of the righteous &s;ad, and &s;trengthened the hands of the wicked, that he &s;hould not return from his wicked way, by promi&s;ing him life: But we are &s;o far from &s;trengthening the hands of the wicked, and &s;aying, that no evil &s;hall come upon them; that we declare from the Scripture, that 'the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, again&s;t all ungodli|ne&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men, who hold the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; unto them that are con|tentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey un|righteou&s;ne&s;s, indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h, upon every &s;oul of man that doeth evil; of the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o of the Gentile,' Rom. i. 18. ii. 8, 9. And that 'there is no peace to the wicked,' I&s;ai. xlviii. 22. lvii. 20, 21. There|fore, they are called to repent, and turn to God; for in &s;in they never can be happy: no unholy, or unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of Hea|ven. And &s;o far are we from promi&s;ing them life in their wicked ways, that we te&s;tify, from the

<P>I had intended to propo&s;e that text as an objection to your &s;y&s;tem; it is, indeed, one that Dr. WHITBY in&s;i&s;ts much upon: But I &s;ee how you will an&s;wer it&mdash;that the unbeliever, as &s;uch, <HI>and while he &s;o continues,</HI> cannot &s;ee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him, while he remaineth in unbelief; but that God can take away the cau&s;e, in his own time, and then the effect &s;hall cea&s;e.</P>

<P>Certainly, this mu&s;t be the meaning: for St. John only meant to de&s;cribe the difference between believers and unbelievers, <HI>as &s;uch;</HI> but could not mean to intimate, that tho&s;e who were unbelievers, in his time, &s;hould always continue &s;o.</P>
<P>But I now pa&s;s to con&s;ider the latter part of this objection, upon which I have dwelt &s;o long; <HI>viz.</HI> that it is the nature God to lay the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible re&s;traint upon &s;in, and, therefore he has threatened it with <HI>everla&s;ting damnation,</HI> which mu&s;t intend <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery;</HI> and as this re&s;traint is found too weak, wholly to prevent evil, what an amazing increa&s;e would there be, if this re&s;traint &s;hould be taken off, in any degree; as it mu&s;t be, if it &s;hould come to be known that puni&s;h|ments were only <HI>for certain ages or periods,</HI> and de|&s;igned for the <HI>amendment</HI> of the &s;ufferers?</P>
<P>I once a&s;ked a Reverend Divine, what was his &s;tronge&s;t argument in favour of <HI>endle&s;s puni&s;hment?</HI> and he told me, this which is mentioned above; and, therefore as it is of con&s;iderable importance, I &s;hall give it a brief con&s;ideration.
<LIST>
<PB N="129" REF="025050_0185_102D76DD6FABBC40">
<ITEM>1. It is not quite clear to me, that it is the na|ture of God to lay the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible re&s;traint up|on &s;in; and that he always doth &s;o, in all his di&s;|pen&s;ations. He &s;ometimes has higher de&s;igns in view, than barely to re&s;train &s;in: he &s;ometimes, perhaps, &s;uffers it to prevail for a time, that his power might be more manife&s;t in de&s;troying it: hence we read, 'Moreover, the law entered'&mdash;not merely to re&s;train &s;in, but&mdash;'that the offence might abound: but where &s;in abounded, grace did much more abound; that as &s;in hath reigned unto death, even &s;o might grace reign, through righteou&s;ne&s;s, unto eternal llfe, by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord. Wherefore, then, &s;erveth the law? It was added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, till the &s;eed &s;hould come, to whom the promi&s;e was made,' Rom. v. 20, 21, Gal. iii. 19. St. Paul &s;ays; 'Sin, taking occa&s;ion by the command|ment, wrought in me all manner of concupi&s;|cence; for, without the law, &s;in was dead. Was, then, that which was good, made death unto me? God forbid: But &s;in, that it might appear &s;in, working death in me, by that which is good; that &s;in, by the commandment, might become exceeding &s;inful,' Rom. vii. 8, 13. Perhaps, if the puni&s;hment of &s;ins immediately followed the commi&s;&s;ion of them, it would be a &s;tronger and more effectual re&s;traint than any threatenings of future mi&s;ery; yet God does not think it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train &s;in by that mean, though it is expre&s;s|ly a&s;&s;erted that, 'Becau&s;e &s;entence again&s;t an evil work is not executed &s;peedily, therefore is the heart of the &s;ons of men fully &s;et in them to do evil.' Eccle&s;. viii. 11. There is no doubt but if the awful puni&s;hments of the future &s;tate were
<PB N="130" REF="025050_0186_102D76B01A250228">
made vi&s;ible to our &s;en&s;es, by any means, they would prove a powerful re&s;traint to &s;in; yet God has not thought fit to re&s;train it by tho&s;e, and perhaps many other po&s;&s;ible ways; Wherefore, I have a right to doubt the premi&s;es; for, if the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible re&s;traints were laid upon &s;in, it might not be &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of proba|tion, as tho&s;e rea&s;onable re&s;traints which God hath thought fit to lay upon it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. But it may be que&s;tioned, whether there is not &s;omething in the idea of limited, yet certain pu|ni&s;hment, &s;o ju&s;t, equitable, rea&s;onable, and evi|dent; that is much more calculated to produce belief, and con&s;equently more effectual to de&s;troy fal&s;e hopes of e&s;caping it, and al&s;o to check that daring pre&s;umption, which ri&s;es out of the idea of <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery,</HI> than can be found in the contrary doctrine. <HI>Endle&s;s puni&s;hment</HI> &s;eems to &s;hock ten|der minds, at lea&s;t. I heard of a little boy, to whom his mother con&s;tantly kept preaching dam|nation without end, for every &s;in; one day, after &s;he had been di&s;cour&s;ing with him in that manner, he went to work, but &s;oon returned back, &s;ud|denly opened the door, and with an air of &s;ur|pri&s;e, cried out; 'Why, mother, the law &s;ays, <HI>'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot;</HI> but you &s;ay, ten thou&s;and for one, and that puni&s;hment &s;hall never end.' I have heard of numbers that had no better excu&s;e for &s;inning greedily, than this, <HI>viz.</HI> that there was no hopes of their being &s;aved; that, therefore, they were determined to &s;in as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;ince it could make no difference. I have rea&s;on to &s;ay, from what I know of mankind, that more per&s;ons refu&s;e to believe in Divine Revelation,
<PB N="131" REF="025050_0187_102D703350E69D48">
becau&s;e it is commonly thought to contain the doctrine of <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery,</HI> than from any other cau&s;e: And numbers have embraced it immedi|ately, upon being fairly convinced that it was not nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand it in that light. And a very &s;en&s;ible Dei&s;t once &s;aid to an acquaintance of mine, who believed and preached the univer&s;al doctrine; 'Had I been acquainted with your &s;y&s;tem, thirty years ago, I &s;hould have been a zealous Chri&s;tian; and as great a friend to Reve|lation, as I have been an enemy.' 'And, pray, why not now Doctor?'&mdash;'Becau&s;e I am a&s;hamed, having &s;o long been fighting again&s;t, to receive it now.'</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Though damnation has been commonly un|der&s;tood to be <HI>endle&s;s,</HI> for many ages; yet it has not (as far as we can judge) prevented evil at all, or very little: but I have mentioned before, how very &s;trict tho&s;e people live, who receive and hold the &s;y&s;tem of limited puni&s;hments: whether it is, that <HI>endle&s;s damnation</HI> is too unnatural to be be|lieved, and that <HI>limited puni&s;hments,</HI> being more rea&s;onable, &s;eem more certain; or whether it be, that by con&s;idering they &s;hall be puni&s;hed, either without end, or not at all; and every one think|ing that endle&s;s puni&s;hment is more than they de|&s;erve, but is only re&s;erved for &s;ome greater &s;inners, and therefore they have nothing to fear from it, I &s;hall not pretend to determine; but certain it is, that where the idea of endle&s;s mi&s;ery prevails, it has not prevented iniquity, in the mea&s;ure that might have been expected, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of its being the truth of GOD.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The great number of Heathens, that die with|out ever being favoured with the light of the go&s;|pel,
<PB N="132" REF="025050_0188_102D76B1E5EEFFA0">
and certainly without ever hearing of endle&s;s mi&s;ery; the many that die in a &s;tate of infancy and childhood; together with the in&s;tances of ide|ots, and per&s;ons born deaf; all convince me, more than any logical arguments, that God has many ways of in&s;tructing and reclaiming his creatures, in another &s;tate, that we are at pre&s;ent unacquaint|ed with.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. It is not &s;o much the intention of God, mere|ly to re&s;train &s;in, as to &s;hew it in all its dreadful deformity, puni&s;h it according to its de&s;erts, and, finally, to &s;hew the &s;uper-abounding of his grace, in overcoming and totally de&s;troying it out of his creation; which &s;hall be accompli&s;hed when He that &s;itteth upon the throne &s;hall make all things new; 'And there &s;hall be no more death, nei|ther &s;orrow, nor crying; neither &s;hall there be any more pain; for the former things are pa&s;&s;ed away,' Rev. xxi. 4.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. As the doctrine of the final Re&s;toration, has been &s;hewn in it&s;elf not to have the lea&s;t tendency to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, but directly the rever&s;e; and, as far as I can learn, by hi&s;tory, or my own ob&s;erva|tion, tho&s;e who have believed it, in the manner here laid down, as perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with a fu|ture &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, have been particularly careful to depart from iniquity of eve|ry kind: yet if any &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t to all that is good, as to pervert this truth (revealed for contra|ry purpo&s;es) to their own de&s;truction, they alone mu&s;t bear the blame, the lo&s;s, and the puni&s;h|ment. The Scriptures, of truth have been per|verted; yet, that is no argument again&s;t Divine Revelation: The Go&s;pel of the Grace of GOD, has been abu&s;ed; but &s;hould it never be preached
<PB N="133" REF="025050_0189_102D76E0F062F298">
on that account? Some, in the apo&s;tles days, turned the Grace of GOD it&s;elf into wantonne&s;s or la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, (See Jude 4); and others pretended that tho&s;e holy men encouraged &s;in, by proclaim|ing &s;alvation to &s;inners, through grace, or faith in Chri&s;t; of which St. Paul complains, (Rom. iii. 8.) 'We be &s;landerou&s;ly reported, and &s;ome af|firm that we &s;ay, Let us do evil, that good may come: who&s;e damnation is ju&s;t'&mdash;The holy apo&s;|tle abhorred, and con&s;tantly denied this horrid con&s;equence, which &s;ome perver&s;e minds pre|tended to draw from his doctrine; he declared that the damnation of &s;uch was ju&s;t, who did &s;in that grace might abound, or who affirmed that the doctrine led thereto, or that the apo&s;tles taught or practi&s;ed any &s;uch things; neverthele&s;s, (not as fools, but as wi&s;e) they did not think fit to lay the go&s;pel a&s;ide, and refu&s;e to preach &s;alvation through CHRIST any more on that account: The &s;elf-&s;ame rea&s;oning applies to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</ITEM>

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s that you have &s;o far pre|vailed as to &s;ilence this great objection; for cer|tainly the belief of the Re&s;toration feems by your account of it con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of grace, and the knowledge and practice of religion. But though you have obviated &s;everal objections, there is one you have not yet touched, which is very con&s;i|derable, and I am doubtful that it will be difficult if not impo&s;&s;ible for you to an&s;wer fairly, it may be thus expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>God has abounded towards us in all wi&s;dom:</HI> one in&s;tance is his hanging out the threat|enings of the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments to prevent his creatures from &s;inning while in this world; but to tell them at the &s;ame time, that if they &s;hould &s;in he means to &s;ave them, is not <HI>prudent;</HI> becau&s;e
<PB N="134" REF="025050_0190_102D76B3B09D3C78">
that le&s;&s;ens, if not de&s;troys the force of his threat|ening. He told Adam that if he did eat, he &s;hould &s;urely die; but did not tell him (at the &s;ame time) that if he &s;hould eat, his ca&s;e would not be remedi|le&s;s; this were to take down with one hand what he had &s;et up with the other. After the threaten|ing failed of the effect, he told him &s;o, and not be|fore, this was prudently done; &s;o after his threat|enings fail of effect in this &s;tate, is the time to re|veal his de&s;ign of &s;aving daring &s;inners. We may therefore be &s;ure that he has not done it yet, and that we mi&s;con&s;true tho&s;e texts which &s;eem to con|tain &s;uch a revelation. The next &s;tate is the only &s;tate to preach the doctrine, and reveal the doc|trine.

<P>As &s;pecious and plau&s;ible as this ob|jection &s;eems, I doubt not of being able to an&s;wer it fairly, without evading the natural force of it in the lea&s;t. The fir&s;t thing that I &s;hall notice in this objection, is the very different and contrary man|ner in which you apply tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle from his fir&s;t evident intention. <HI>He hath abounded towards us in all wi&s;dom and prudence, having made known unto us the my&s;tery of his will according to his good plea&s;ure, which he hath purpo&s;ed in him&s;elf, that in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, he might gather together in one all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in Heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</HI> Ephe&s;. i. 8, 9, 10. God hath judged it be the height of heavenly wi&s;dom and prudence to make known to his &s;aints, his glorious purpo&s;e, finally to rehead all things in Chri&s;t; and we ought not to pre&s;ume to be more wi&s;e and prudent than he.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="025050_0191_102D76E2CCAC1078">
There is no doubt but God hath revealed this great truth more immediately to his &s;aints and faithful ones for their con&s;olation, than for the be|nefit of the finally impenitent.</P>
<P>It is of amazing, I had almo&s;t &s;aid of infinite u&s;e to the people of God, to have this divine coun|&s;el declared to them in the pre&s;ent time. The knowledge of this truth entirely removes all hard thoughts of God from the minds of tho&s;e who re|ceive it, as I can te&s;tify by experience; for &s;ince I have believed in the doctrine of the univer&s;al Re|&s;toration, I have never had one hard thought of God abiding for one minute in my mind, that I re|member, and never expect to have any more while I continue to believe it firmly.</P>
<P>The belief of the Re&s;toration is of great u&s;e in &s;upporting good people under their &s;orrows and trials here; the idea that evil &s;hall be de&s;troyed, and all things re&s;tored to their primitive glory is the mo&s;t con&s;olatory of all other ideas. As this doctrine tends to remove the greate&s;t difficulties from the plan of Providence, and al&s;o from di|vine Revelation, it is evident that the knowledge of it mu&s;t be of the greate&s;t u&s;e to all that love their great Creator. And therefore if the reve|lation of it an&s;wered no other purpo&s;e in this life, but for the happine&s;s, joy, and &s;atisfaction of &s;uch as love God, we might be &s;ure that he hath made it known, and that we rightly under&s;tand tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages that hold it forth; for &s;ince 'the &s;e|cret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will &s;hew them his covenant,' P&s;al. xxv. 14. and 'The Lord God will do nothing, but he re|vealeth his &s;ecret unto his &s;ervants the prophets,' Amos iii. 7. there is all the rea&s;on to conclude,

that if God ever intended to re&s;tore mankind hereafter, he would not fail to reveal it to his cho&s;en and faithful &s;ervants. And this he hath done, if I can under&s;tand the meaning of words.</P>
<P>It is true that God did not inform our fir&s;t pa|rents before they &s;inned that he had provided a remedy; but not long did he delay after the fall to reveal to them, that the &s;eed of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head, Gen. iii. 15. and this one text contains in miniature all that I believe re&s;pecting the Re&s;toration of mankind; for if the Serpent's head is finally to be brui&s;ed, his power and influence over mankind, mu&s;t be entirely de|&s;troyed; and then what &s;hall prevent their return to God?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is impo&s;&s;ible to read the Scriptures attentively, and not perceive that God very fre|quently mixes promi&s;es of mercies among his &s;e|vere&s;t threatenings of judgment; and yet he doth not throw down with one hand, what he builds up with the other.</P>
<P>Your object &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e that the doctrine of the Re&s;toration &s;uper&s;edes and &s;ets a&s;ide tho&s;e puni&s;hments which God has threatened to inflict upon the impenitent; or el&s;e how does the preach|ing of this doctrine weaken the force of the threat|enings? But this is a very fal&s;e idea; for we ac|knowledge that the threatenings &s;hall be fulfilled, and not that the di&s;obedient &s;hall e&s;cape unpun&s;hed. There is a great deal of difference between the&s;e two ideas, though you would intimate them to be the &s;ame, and that we contradict God by a&s;&s;uring the wicked that they &s;hall e&s;cape the ju&s;t judgment of God. But we only declare that an end &s;hall finally come to their puni&s;hment, and that when
<PB N="137" REF="025050_0193_102D703517879EE0">
they &s;hall be &s;ufficiently humbled a di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy &s;hall &s;ucceed that of judgment. Let me a&s;k you, Has not God threatened mankind with death on the account of &s;in? 'Du&s;t thou art, and unto du&s;t thou &s;halt return.' Gen. iii. 19. Well, tell me, is this threatening either weakened or de|&s;troyed by the knowledge of the great doctrine of the re&s;urrection of the dead? Did not God threaten the children of I&s;rael with dreadful judgments to prevent their &s;inning, and that they &s;hould be di&s;per&s;ed among all nations? but will you &s;ay that he either weakened or di&s;troyed the force of his threatenings, becau&s;e he promi&s;ed them at the &s;ame time that at la&s;t he would return their captivity, and re&s;tore them as at the fir&s;t, and do better unto them, than at their beginning.</P>
<P>The laws of this country condemn criminals to death: would it be thought that I &s;hould weak|en or de&s;troy the force of the penal &s;tatutes, by &s;aying, that the execution of the law could only be felt for a certain time, beyond which it could not endure? Is not every malefactor under the &s;en|tence of death &s;uppo&s;ed to know this? and yet will any pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that the&s;e laws are entire|ly weakened, and their force de&s;troyed becau&s;e they do not condemn tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors to endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hments? But, if it be allowed that torments, which are but momentary, have a con&s;iderable in|fluence in re&s;training many vices, there cannot be the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to fear that the doctrine of ju&s;t retribution according to the deeds done in the bo|dy, will open the door to vice and immorality, but on the contrary. But this objection is &s;o near a kin to the la&s;t which you propo&s;ed, that it hard|ly de&s;erves a di&s;tinct con&s;ideration; for if the
<PB N="138" REF="025050_0194_102D76B755DA2D60">
doctrine of the Re&s;toration does not lead men to commit &s;in, (as I am &s;ure it has no &s;uch tendency) then no harm can be apprehended from its being known in this &s;tate. And whereas you argue, that as it would not be proper for the pre&s;ent &s;tate, we may be &s;ure that God hath not revealed it; and therefore is highly proper for men to know in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. You will plea&s;e therefore to no|tice that the univer&s;al doctrine, &s;o far from tend|ing to render the divine threatenings u&s;ele&s;s or vain, weakening their force, or &s;etting them a&s;ide, operates in the direct contrary manner. I as much believe as you or any other man can do, that all the threatenings will be fulfilled upon the finally impenitent; but dare not carry the matter &s;o far as to &s;et a&s;ide the gracious promi&s;es of God, with which the Scriptures appear to me to abound, in favour of the final recovery of all at la&s;t.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t I think be confe&s;&s;ed that if the doctrine of the Re&s;toration be true, it would be matter of great joy and comfort for good men to know it, for they have often great trouble and anxiety of mind on the account of their families, friends, neighbours, acquaintance, and mankind in general; which &s;orrow would be greatly reliev|ed, could they have an idea of the Re&s;toration of all things in the manner you hold it. But however true this may be, it &s;eems not to be plain|ly revealed in the Scripture, otherwi&s;e it would not be hidden from the eyes of &s;o many great and good men.</P>

<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, that a &s;ubject may be re|vealed in the plaine&s;t manner, and yet the be&s;t of men may remain ignorant of it. For in&s;tance, were not the &s;ufferings, death, and re&s;urrection of our
<PB N="139" REF="025050_0195_102D76E4DA4F9C68">
Lord plainly revealed in the Scriptures of the old Te&s;tament? And yet we know that the apo&s;tles of our Saviour did not under&s;tand one of tho&s;e prophecies. Nay, when Je&s;us told them openly and expre&s;sly that he mu&s;t be delivered into the hands of men, and that they &s;hould mock, &s;courge, and crucify him, and that the third day he &s;hould ri&s;e again, they did not comprehend his meaning; although he &s;poke to them frequently and very plainly upon the &s;ubject, and &s;aid, 'Let the&s;e &s;ayings &s;ink down into your ears: for the Son of man &s;hall be delivered into the hands of men. But they under&s;tood not this &s;aying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not; and they feared to a&s;k him of that &s;aying.' St. Luke ix. 44, 45. And in another place we read, 'For he taught his di&s;ciples, and &s;aid unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they &s;hall kill him: and after that he is killed, he &s;hall ri&s;e the third day.' It is impo&s;&s;ible that words &s;hould be more expre&s;s, or le&s;s liable to be mi&s;|under&s;tood. 'But (as the evangeli&s;t immediately informs us) 'they under&s;tood not that &s;aying, and were afraid to a&s;k him.' St. Mark ix. 31, 32. And in the &s;ame chapter we find, that after our Lord Je&s;us was transfigured upon the mount, in the pre&s;ence of Peter, James, and John, 'As they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they &s;hould tell no man what things they had &s;een, till the Son of man were ri&s;en from the dead. And they kept that &s;aying with them|&s;elves, que&s;tioning one with another what the ri&s;|ing from the dead &s;hould mean.' Ver. 9, 10. This was what Chri&s;t taught them not only plainly, but al&s;o frequently. See St. Matt. xvi. 21. xvii. 9,

<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding the plainne&s;s and frequen|cy of the&s;e predictions, and the pains which Chri&s;t took to in&s;til the&s;e ideas into them, they never un|der&s;tood them at all until &s;ometime after they were fulfilled. For when they &s;aw him taken and de|livered into the hands of men, and treated exactly according to his own words often repeated, they were entirely di&s;appointed, and all their hopes &s;eemed to die within them. And when he was ri&s;en from the dead, they would not believe the te&s;timo|ny of tho&s;e who had &s;een him, and would hardly tru&s;t their own &s;en&s;es, &s;o ignorant were they of what he had told them.</P>
<P>St. John was the fir&s;t of the di&s;ciples who be|lieved that he was ri&s;en, for thus he writes 'Then went in al&s;o that other di&s;ciple, who came fir&s;t to the &s;epulchre, and he &s;aw and believed. For as yet they knew not the Scripture that he mu&s;t ri&s;e again from the dead.' Sr. John xx. 8, 9. This in&s;tance is &s;o much to my purpo&s;e, and proves &s;o evidently that a thing may be plainly revealed, and expre&s;&s;ed in the cleare&s;t manner, and yet not be under&s;tood; that I hardly need mention any more. But I will mention another, and that is, the calling of the Gentiles. This was &s;poken of by the pro|phets, in the cleare&s;t language; and Je&s;us after his re&s;urrection gave a full commi&s;&s;ion to his apo&s;|tles, which one would think it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to mi&s;under&s;tand.</P>
<P>'All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth, Go ye therefore and teach all nations,' &amp;c.
<PB N="141" REF="025050_0197_102D76E6A10A0DB8">
St. Matt. xxviii. 18, 19. 'Go ye unto all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature.' St. Mark xvi. 15.</P>
<P>'Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chri&s;t to &s;uffer, and to ri&s;e from the dead on the third day: and that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached among all nations, beginning at Jeru&s;alem. And ye are witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e things.' St. Luke xxiv. 46, 47, 48. 'Ye &s;hall receive power after that the Holy Gho&s;t is come upon you: and ye &s;hall be witne&s;&s;es unto me both in Judea and in Samaria, and unto the uttermo&s;t part of the earth.' Acts i. 8. But the apo&s;tles them|&s;elves, even after the miraculous de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t upon them, were without under&s;tand|ing, re&s;pecting the calling of the Gentiles, until St. Peter was taught it by a vi&s;ion from heaven. See Acts x.</P>
<P>And St. Paul &s;peaks of this &s;ubject as a my&s;te|ry that was hid from ages and generations, and particularly revealed to him, and to the &s;aints in that day. See Ephe&s;. iii. 1&mdash;11. Col. i. 25, 26, 27.</P>
<P>Wherefore, when I con&s;ider that the apo&s;tles them&s;elves could not for a time &s;ee tho&s;e things to be revealed, which yet were mo&s;t plainly, fully, and frequently told them, I cannot wonder that many great and good men now &s;hould not &s;ee the general Redemption and final Re&s;toration of all things plainly revealed in the Scriptures, though to me &s;carce any &s;ubject appears more evident. It gives me now but little concern to hear many &s;ay, that they cannot &s;ee the matter plainly declared in the Bible, &s;ince I know that things have been there that wi&s;e and good men could not &s;ee; and

what has happened in times pa&s;t may take place now: and if I can &s;ee for my&s;elf, this great truth made known, it is enough for me. I am not to enquire, What does this man believe?

If this doctrine of the final Re&s;toration of all things had been true, &s;urely our wi&s;e, good, and learned mini&s;ters would have di&s;covered it, and proclaimed it long ago. But the doctrine of end|le&s;s mi&s;ery is a point in which they &s;eem generally to agree, however they differ in other matters, and therefore it mu&s;t be true, and this doctrine of the general Re&s;toration, which this man holds up, al|mo&s;t alone, mu&s;t be fal&s;e.'</P>

<P>I am very far from pretending to be wi&s;er than any that have gone before me; and as for this doctrine of the Re&s;toration it was not only believed and preached by the apo&s;tles, but many of the ancient fathers who liveth in the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity, were bold witne&s;&s;es for this glori|ous truth. It is true that when the Church of Rome ro&s;e to &s;upreme power, the Popes and Coun|cils endeavoured to extirpate the <HI>merciful doctors</HI> (as tho&s;e who believed the general Re&s;toration, were called in deri&s;ion) and their adherents, but it was not until near the clo&s;e of the &s;eventh cen|tury, that they were able to &s;ilence the witne&s;&s;es for this truth. This, (as well as many other pre|cious
<PB N="143" REF="025050_0199_102D76E897E9FA90">
truths) then lay hid until the reformation, when it began a little to revive, and hath gradually increa&s;ed ever &s;ince. Several great authors have written upon it; many hundreds, and even thou|&s;ands have believed it, and found comfort and joy therein. Nay, there are many mini&s;ters who be|lieve it now as firmly as I do, but do not chu&s;e to confe&s;s or preach it, for various rea&s;ons; and great numbers of private chri&s;tians enjoy the com|fort and happine&s;s of believing it &s;ecretly. But put the ca&s;e that I &s;tood alone in this te&s;timony, yet if upon a fair examination, the Scriptures hold forth this idea, and if all objections again&s;t it may be fully an&s;wered; why &s;hould my te&s;timony be refu&s;ed on the account of its &s;ingularity? God has an ab&s;olute right to u&s;e what means or in&s;truments he plea&s;es, to manife&s;t his truth, and to fulfil his purpo&s;es; and though I am nothing, and in his &s;ight am le&s;s than nothing, yet he is able by the things that are not, to confound and bring to nought the things that are, that no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his pre&s;ence. 1 Cor. i. 28, 29.</P>
<P>I acknowledge that the generality of mini&s;ters in the pre&s;ent day profe&s;s to believe endle&s;s mi&s;ery, though they di&s;agree in other points; and indeed one rea&s;on why they fall out &s;o much about other doctrines, is, becau&s;e they receive this as a fir&s;t principle, as is very obvious; for were tho&s;e who believe that Chri&s;t died only for a part of mankind, once to give up the idea of endle&s;s mi&s;ery, they would acknowledge the univer&s;ality of the love of God, and confe&s;s that Je&s;us died for all in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e. And on the other hand, if tho&s;e who believe in general redemption, were not &s;o exceed|ingly tenacious of the doctrine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery,
<PB N="144" REF="025050_0200_102D73A2213EDD40">
they would not oppo&s;e the doctrine of election, nor hold that the will of God might be finally fru&s;trated, and that the death of Chri&s;t &s;hall be in vain, with re&s;pect to many, and that many ob|jects of the divine love &s;hall finally peri&s;h to all eternity. The&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies in their &s;entiments, and the conte&s;ts between them and tho&s;e who hold partial redemption and &s;alvation, are therefore chiefly, if not wholly owing to both parties being agreed in this mo&s;t dreadful doctrine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>It is beautiful to ob&s;erve the progre&s;&s;ion of the glorious go&s;pel, from its opening to our fir&s;t pa|rents in the garden down to the pre&s;ent day. I have &s;ometimes mentioned, in public, that the more the go&s;pel is known and revealed, the larger and richer it appears.</P>
<P>It fir&s;t &s;eemed confined to one family or nation, but later di&s;coveries &s;hewed that all nations had a part therein, and all &s;orts of people were de&s;igned to &s;hare in its ble&s;&s;ings: now the glorious news begins to be publi&s;hed abroad, not only that all nations, and all &s;orts of people, but all per&s;ons and individuals, without exception, not only <HI>may</HI> par|take of its benefits, but <HI>&s;hall</HI> in due time enjoy great advantages thereby.</P>
<P>God always adapts his remedies to the evils that prevail in the world; and therefore he hath opened his coun&s;els to men according to their dif|ferent capacities, needs, and circum&s;tances. Chri&s;ti|anity might, formerly, have been received and &s;in|cerely practi&s;ed, without being inve&s;tigated at all; but when infidelity ri&s;es up and attacks it, as it does in this our age, it becomes the duty of its friends to defend it, by enquiring into its meaning; and
<PB N="145" REF="025050_0201_102D74D791B0A7F0">
laying all prejudices a&s;ide, to receive as truth tho&s;e things which God hath revealed, and the &s;ame to vindicate before the world.</P>
<P>It might not formerly have been nece&s;&s;ary to un|der&s;tand all the prophecies; and yet now, as the time of their fulfilment draws nigh, they may be|come more important, be more &s;tudied, and better under&s;tood; and for this purpo&s;e, God may actu|ally illuminate the minds of &s;ome, to &s;et them forth in a more national, &s;criptural, con&s;i&s;tent man|ner than they have appeared in hitherto. And if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to make any u&s;e of my tongue or pen for this great purpo&s;e, the glory &s;hall be all a&s;cribed to his name, to whom alone it is due; I &s;hall have nothing to glory or boa&s;t of, fora&s;much as I can only communicate what I receive; and I hope none will refu&s;e to receive the truth, however weak or unworthy the in&s;trument by which God may plea&s;e to &s;end it.</P>

But let not the man who would write, dip his pen in gall; nor he that would conver&s;e, make his tongue as a &s;harp &s;word: but 'Let all bitterne&s;s, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-&s;peaking, be put away from you, with all malice; and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, hath for|given you.

<P>But Mr. POOLE'S Continuators, as well as many other eminent divines, tell us, that the&s;e which you take to be promi&s;es, are only dreadful threatenings; and their meaning is this:&mdash;I never will bring again the captivity of <HI>Samaria,</HI> and her daughters; nor the captivity of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and her daughters; neither will I ever bring again the cap|tivity of <HI>thy captives,</HI> in the mid&s;t of them: when <HI>Sodom</HI> and her daughters &s;hall return to their form|er e&s;tate, (which is impo&s;&s;ible) and <HI>Samaria</HI> and her daughters &s;hall return to their former e&s;tate, (which &s;hall never be) then <HI>thou</HI> and thy daughters &s;hall return to your former e&s;tate: but that time &s;hall never come.</P>

<P>I know, &s;uch is their interpretation, which proves nothing more than the weakne&s;s of their cau&s;e; for in all this, they expre&s;sly contra|dict GOD, who, from the 60th ver&s;e to the end of the chapter, promi&s;es ble&s;&s;ings to Jeru&s;alem in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute manner; That he will remember the covenant made with her in the days of her youth, and will e&s;tabli&s;h unto her an everla&s;ting covenant; that &s;he &s;hall receive her &s;i&s;ters, <HI>Samaria</HI> and <HI>Sodom,</HI> (called her <HI>elder</HI> and her <HI>younger</HI> &s;i&s;|ters); and he promi&s;es to give them to her, for
<PB N="153" REF="025050_0209_102D71213B7367F8">
daughters; not by the fir&s;t covenant, indeed, but by the new and everla&s;ting covenant, which he will make in tho&s;e days; then &s;hall the covenant be firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed with her; &s;he &s;hall know JE|HOVAH; &s;hall remember, and be confounded; and never &s;hall open her mouth in pride any more, becau&s;e of her former &s;in and &s;hame, when GOD &s;hall be pacified toward her, for all that &s;he hath done.</P>
<P>How many promi&s;es has GOD made to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in the prophecies, of not only bringing her <HI>captivi|ty,</HI> and returning her to her <HI>former e&s;tate;</HI> but even cau&s;ing greater ble&s;&s;ings than ever to come to her, and of doing <HI>better</HI> to her than in her <HI>beginning,</HI> making her an <HI>eternal excellency,</HI> a <HI>joy</HI> of <HI>many ge|nerations,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is therefore very &s;urpri&s;ing, that men profe&s;|&s;ing to believe the Bible, &s;hould dare be &s;o bold as to deny the&s;e promi&s;es, and declare, that GOD will never bring <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to her former e&s;tate! They might, indeed, &s;afely &s;ay, that the promi&s;es have not yet been fulfilled; but it is too bold to a&s;&s;ert, That therefore they will never be accompli&s;hed. Were there no other text to prove the Re&s;toration of the Jews who died in their &s;ins, and indeed of the whole fallen race of Adam, I &s;hould judge this &s;uf|ficient;&mdash;'<HI>All</HI> that the <HI>Father giveth me, &s;hall come to me;</HI> and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out. For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that &s;ent me. And this is the <HI>Father's</HI> will, which hath &s;ent me, that of <HI>all</HI> which he hath given me, I &s;hould lo&s;e <HI>nothing;</HI> but &s;hould rai&s;e it up a|gain at the la&s;t day,' St. John vi. 37, 38, 30. Here we find that <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> our <HI>Lord,</HI> declares, not only

that <HI>all</HI> that the <HI>Father giveth</HI> him <HI>&s;hall come</HI> to him; but al&s;o, that they &s;hall come in &s;uch a man|ner, as in no wi&s;e to be <HI>co&s;t out;</HI> and that &s;uch is the <HI>Father's</HI> will, that nothing of all which he hath given to the <HI>Son,</HI> &s;hould be lo&s;t, or mi&s;&s;ing, at that great day when he &s;hall deliver up the kingdom to the <HI>Father,</HI> who did put all things under him; and as this is the will of that <HI>God who worketh all things after the coun&s;el of his own will;</HI> and as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has undertaken the accompli&s;hment of this will of the <HI>Father,</HI> it concludes ab&s;olutely and forcibly again&s;t the doctrine of <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery,</HI> and <HI>annihila|tion.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is all that I contend for: I ground the univer&s;al Re&s;toration of all things, up|on the&s;e two premi&s;es, which I call the <HI>major</HI> and the <HI>minor,</HI> 1. That <HI>all things</HI> are given to the <HI>Son,</HI> without exception: 2. That <HI>all</HI> that are <HI>given him, &s;hall come to him,</HI> in &s;uch a manner as <HI>not to be ca&s;t out;</HI> and that none &s;hall be mi&s;&s;ing, lo&s;t, or wholly de&s;troyed, but &s;hall be forth-coming, in that great day when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall give up the king|dom to the <HI>Father.</HI></P>

<P>But can you prove your <HI>major?</HI> I am &s;en&s;ible that the <HI>minor</HI> has been the great founda|tion upon which <HI>particular redemption,</HI> &amp;c. has been &s;upported; but if the <HI>major</HI> can be proved, it will &s;et the &s;tronge&s;t weapons of tho&s;e who hold <HI>partial decrees,</HI> &amp;c. directly again&s;t them, and will give another turn, to the argument.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can prove the <HI>major</HI> by the &s;ame po|&s;itive expre&s;&s;ions as the <HI>minor,</HI> and by more pa&s;&s;a|ges
<PB N="155" REF="025050_0211_102D7123561B39B8">
of Scripture; and you &s;hall judge for your|&s;elf, whether I quote them fairly, and whether they can be invalidated by any arguments which will not, at the &s;ame time, invalidate the <HI>minor.</HI> I will &s;et down the &s;everal texts at large, as they are of great importance.</P>
<P>St. Matth. x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 27. '<HI>All things</HI> are delivered un|to me of my <HI>Father:</HI> and no man knoweth the <HI>Son</HI> but the <HI>Father:</HI> neither knoweth any man the <HI>Father,</HI> &s;ave the <HI>Son,</HI> and he to whom&s;oever the <HI>Son</HI> will reveal him.' The very &s;ame words are mentioned by St. Luke: See chap. x. 22.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages of this kind, are found in the go&s;pel of St. John, chap. iii. 35. and xiii. 3. 'The <HI>Father</HI> loveth the <HI>Son,</HI> and hath gi|ven <HI>all things</HI> into his hands. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> knowing that the <HI>Father</HI> had given <HI>all things</HI> into his hands, and that he was come from <HI>God,</HI> and went to <HI>God,</HI> &amp;c.'</P>
<P><HI>God</HI> hath moreover &s;aid to his <HI>Son,</HI> 'A&s;k of me, and I &s;hall give thee the heathen for thine in|heritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,' P&s;al. ii. 8.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>all things</HI> are given to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> without ex|ception. The <HI>major</HI> and <HI>minor</HI> being both proved from Scripture, we may venture to draw this con|clu&s;ion:</P>
<P>If <HI>all things</HI> are given into the hands of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> by the <HI>Father;</HI> and all that the <HI>Father</HI> giveth, or hath given, &s;hall come to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in &s;uch a man|ner as not to be ca&s;t out; then &s;hall all men be re|&s;tored.</P>
<P>Here the whole Chri&s;tian world may unite, with|out either party being obliged to give up their fa|vourite tenets: and while &s;ome &s;trongly contend,
<PB N="156" REF="025050_0212_102D73B089AA4DE0">
and prove from Scripture, that <HI>all things</HI> are deli|vered into the hands of <HI>Je&s;us&punc;</HI> let the others go on to prove, that <HI>all</HI> that the <HI>Father</HI> giveth, &s;hall come in &s;uch a manner as no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be ca&s;t out: Thus &s;hall the truth be promoted mutually and equally, by tho&s;e who &s;eem to contradict each other; but neither &s;hall, in that ca&s;e, contradict what our Lord hath &s;aid.</P>
<P>But as <HI>all things</HI> or <HI>all men,</HI> without exception, are given to <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> that he might re&s;tore, or bring them back to God, in his own way and time; &s;o is he inve&s;ted with <HI>all power,</HI> that he might be able to accompli&s;h &s;o great a work. <HI>Je&s;us &s;pake,</HI> &s;aying, '<HI>All power</HI> is given unto me, in Heaven and in earth,' St. Matth. xxviii. 18, 'For as the <HI>Father</HI> hath life in him&s;elf, &s;o hath he given to the <HI>Son</HI> to have life in him&s;elf; and hath given him autho|rity to execute judgment al&s;o, becau&s;e he is the Son of man,' St. John v. 26, 27. <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> or <HI>Lord,</HI> has power to quicken &s;ouls who are dead in tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins; See Ephe&s;. ii. 1. He him&s;elf &s;aith; 'Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> and they that hear, &s;hall live, St. John v. 25. He hath power to rai&s;e all the dead that are in their graves; for he &s;aith, 'Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves &s;hall hear his voice, and &s;hall come forth: they that have done good, to the re&s;urrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the re&s;urrection of damnation,' ver&s;e 29.

re&s;erve, are given to him, and univer&s;al power and dominion are his, for this very purpo&s;e; if all the&s;e premi&s;es are true&mdash;as who can deny?&mdash;then nothing can be more evident than this con|clu&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>All &s;hall be at la&s;t re&s;tored.</HI></P>

<P>This is quite a different comment from what I have ever heard before; but allowing this objection to be an&s;wered, I have another in my mind, that appears very difficult, and I &s;hould be glad to know what you can &s;ay upon it; it is drawn from I&s;aiah xxvii. 11. 'For it is a people of no under&s;tanding; therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will &s;hew them no favour.' How can they ever be re&s;tored, if GOD will not have mercy upon them, nor &s;hew them any favour?</P>

<P>If we did not under&s;tand the&s;e words with &s;ome limitation, it would be as difficult to re|concile them with other pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, as with the doctrine of the Re&s;toration; but if we only limit the time, all is ea&s;y; 'He &s;hall have judgment without mercy, that hath &s;hewed no mercy;' neverthele&s;s it is added, 'but mercy re|joiceth again&s;t judgment,' James ii. 13. The way I an&s;wer all the&s;e threatenings, and &s;hew them to be con&s;i&s;tent with that boundle&s;s mercy of GOD, that is over all his works, is, to &s;hew, that both wrath and mercy have their &s;ea&s;on; that <HI>anger en|dureth</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="025050_0218_102D73FCA34F1FA0">
but a <HI>moment,</HI> but that <HI>mercy endureth for ever;</HI> which glorious declaration is expre&s;&s;ed more than forty times in the Scripture; and that God frequently threatens the greate&s;t judgments, and promi&s;eth the greate&s;t mercies, to the &s;ame people and per&s;ons. 'Thus &s;aith JEHOVAH, Thy brui&s;e is incurable, and thy wound is grievous. There is none to plead thy cau&s;e, that thou maye&s;t be bound up: thou ha&s;t no healing medicines. All thy lovers have forgotten thee: they &s;eek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the cha&s;ti&s;ement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; becau&s;e thy &s;ins were increa&s;ed. Why crie&s;t thou for thine affliction? Thy &s;orrow is incurable, for the mul|titude of thine iniquity: becau&s;e thy &s;ins were in|crea&s;ed, I have done the&s;e things unto thee.' Now, who would not think, from reading the&s;e words, that the&s;e people were in a mo&s;t hopele&s;s &s;tate, beyond the reach of mercy; and that it was in vain for them even to &s;eek it?&mdash;And yet the ve|ry next words &s;peak a language directly contrary. 'Therefore all they that devour thee, &s;hall be de|voured, &amp;c. For I will re&s;tore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, &s;aith JEHO|VAH; becau&s;e they called thee an Outca&s;t, &s;aying, This is <HI>Zion,</HI> whom no man &s;eeketh after.' See Jer. xxx. 12&mdash;17. I could ju&s;tify this ob&s;erva|tion by hundreds of pa&s;&s;ages wherein GOD threat|ens his people with judgments the mo&s;t &s;evere, and declares&mdash;that his eye &s;hall not pity, nor his arm &s;ave; that he will vi&s;it their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions upon them, will utterly ca&s;t them off, and will not have compa&s;&s;ion on them at all; and then &s;uch promi&s;es of mercy break out as are &s;ufficient to a|&s;toni&s;h
<PB N="163" REF="025050_0219_102D712DD883C1C0">
every one with their greatne&s;s. But time would fail to quote them at large. GOD, by Ho|&s;ea, &s;ays, 'I will no more have mercy upon the hou&s;e of I&s;rael; but I will utterly take them away. For ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.' And then immediately &s;ays, &s;peaking of a time to come, 'And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that in the place where it was &s;aid unto them, Ye are not my people, there it &s;hall be &s;aid unto them, 'Ye are the &s;ons of the living GOD.' See Ho&s;ea, i. 6, 9, 10.</P>
<P>The whole prophecy, indeed, &s;eems of a piece with this &s;pecimen. In the &s;econd chapter it is &s;aid, 'Plead with your mother, plead: for &s;he is not my wife, neither am I her hu&s;band; and I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.' Then he goes on to pronounce many dreadful threatenings; but the chapter clo&s;es with the mo&s;t amazing promi&s;es of mercies to the &s;ame people, under the &s;imilitude of a wife that had been rejected, and after a long time received again. 'And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in judgment, and in lov|ing-kindne&s;s, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulne&s;s, and thou &s;halt know the <HI>Lord.</HI> And I will &s;ow her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will &s;ay to them who were not my people, Thou art my people; and they &s;hall &s;ay, Thou art my GOD;' See Ho&s;. ii. 2, 4, 19, 20, 23. Thus the objection admits of a fair and rational an&s;wer; and I have been the larger upon it, becau&s;e I judged it of great importance to clear it up thoroughly: but more pa&s;&s;ages upon

<P>This would be one of the &s;tronge&s;t ob|jections that you have yet advanced, if the words a <HI>great ran&s;om,</HI> had any allu&s;ion to the blood of the dear <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and if it could be fairly demon&s;tra|ted, that it can have no power over the dead; but I apprehend, when you read and con&s;ider the text, context, and &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages, you will &s;ee that no &s;uch thing is intended.</P>
<P><HI>Job</HI> had frequently wi&s;hed for death in his trou|ble and angui&s;h, (as many per&s;ons fooli&s;hly and wickedly do, that have never felt the tenth part of his afflictions) for which <HI>Elihu</HI> ju&s;tly reproves him, in the&s;e words; 'Becau&s;e there is wrath, be|ware

le&s;t he take thee away with his &s;troke; then a great ran&s;om cannot deliver thee,' from death and the grave; from being cut off by the hand of Heaven, ju&s;tly provoked by thy ra&s;hne&s;s: 'Will he e&s;teem thy riches?' Will he account thy great riches a ran&s;om for thy life? 'No not gold, nor all the forces of &s;trength:' Woulde&s;t thou give ever &s;o much of the precious ore to ran&s;om thy life, it would be unavailable; or, &s;houlde&s;t thou tru&s;t in thy &s;trength of body or mind; &s;houlde&s;t thou plead the readine&s;s of thy wit, the &s;trength and greatne&s;s of thy judgment, memory, and other faculties; thy benevolence of di&s;po&s;ition; thy u&s;efulne&s;s in life, thy numerous connections, the great honours that await thee; wert thou a monarch, and coulde&s;t thou command armies and valiant ho&s;ts, &s;trong and mighty; all the&s;e things would be totally di&s;regarded by God, if he, pro|voked by thy ra&s;hne&s;s, &s;hould give thee thy wi&s;h, and i&s;&s;ue the <HI>death warrant</HI> again&s;t thy life: there|fore, con&s;idering the&s;e things, 'De&s;ire not the night (of death and e&s;pecially &s;udden death) when people are cut off in their place,' and there is no remedy, no ran&s;om, no di&s;charge in that war; from which neither power, wi&s;dom, might, riches, honours, wickedne&s;s, nor even virtue, can deliver. 'Take heed, regard not iniquity;' do not &s;in in any wi&s;e, and e&s;pecially do not ra&s;hly wi&s;h for death; which is very pre&s;umptuous and heaven daring; 'for this thou ha&s;t cho&s;en, rather than affliction:' See Job xxxvi. 18, 19, 20, 21. This is evident|ly the plain meaning of the text, and is confirmed by P&s;al. xlix. 6, 7, 8, 9. 'They that tru&s;t in their wealth, and boa&s;t them&s;elves in the multi|tude of their riches; none of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ran|&s;om

for him: (For the redemption of their &s;oul is precious, and it cea&s;eth for ever.) That he &s;hould &s;till live for ever, and not &s;ee corruption.' But, though the power of wealth, wi&s;dom, and &s;trength, are not &s;ufficient to buy a &s;hort reprieve from death; yet the power of GOD is able to ran&s;om therefrom, and to redeem from the grave, or hell, as I have noticed before; and which is expre&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t-mentioned P&s;alm, in the following terms; 'But GOD will redeem my &s;oul from the power of the grave; for he &s;hall receive me,' ver. 15. And by the &s;ame parity of rea&s;oning, that the power of the HIGHEST is able al&s;o to redeem or ran&s;om, the bodies of men from the grave, af|ter they have peri&s;hed there: he is able al&s;o to redeem &s;ouls from &s;in and mi&s;ery, if it be his plea&s;ure; and, by the blood of the MESSIAH'S, covenant, to &s;end &s;orth his pri&s;oners out of the pit wherein is no water, not even a drop to cool the tongues of tho&s;e who are tormented there. I have therefore no doubt, but, the blood of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is able to redeem to the uttermo&s;t, and is &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the power of &s;in, death, and hell. No|thing in the text on which your objection is found|ed, can depreciate the merit of that clean&s;ing, all-powerful blood, by proving that it cannot be ef|fectual to lo&s;t &s;ouls.</P>

<P>No; I have not forgot that &s;uch pa&s;|&s;ages are found in the Bible; and I believe they were written with a de&s;ign to make us diligent, and wi&s;ely to improve our time and talents; and that we &s;hould be liberal in giving alms, which &s;eems e&s;pecially to be the meaning of the la&s;t, if we may judge by the connection in which it is found, and without which I am not able to &s;ay what it in|tends: But, in this ca&s;e, they do not appear to me to be any thing to the purpo&s;e, one way or the other; and yet no Scriptures are more frequently brought than the&s;e again&s;t the doctrine of the Re|&s;toration of all things; but commonly accompani|ed with &s;ome additions; &s;uch as&mdash;'There is no repentance in the grave; Nor pardon offered to the dead.'&mdash;'And as death leaves us, &s;o judgment finds us.'&mdash;Words that I have never found in the Bible; but were they repeated ever &s;o often, could not affect this argument; &s;ince the general Re&s;tora|tion cannot happen till long after the la&s;t Judg|ment, and will not be wholly comple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted till the time of the creation of the new heavens and earth, wherein righteou&s;ne&s;s alone &s;hall dwell.</P>

<P>The Scripture, in abundance of places, highly recommends liberality; and, in the mo&s;t po&s;itive manner, a&s;&s;ures the bounteous, that they &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed: I need not recite pa&s;&s;ages to prove, what is &s;o univer&s;ally known and confe&s;&s;ed. <HI>Solomon,</HI> therefore, having given many excellent precepts to direct us in other matters, comes to exhort us to be bountiful and liberal, in di&s;tributing to the nece&s;&s;ities of others what GOD hath ble&s;&s;ed us with|al; &s;aying, 'Ca&s;t thy bread upon the waters; for

If the clouds be full of rain, they empty them&s;elves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the &s;outh, or to|ward the north; in the place where the tree fall|eth, there it &s;hall be.' Thereby intimating to us, that as certainly as the&s;e plain common ob&s;erva|tions are true, (than which nothing can be more &s;o) &s;hall they who be&s;tow liberally upon the poor and needy, be rewarded; &s;ince GOD has promi&s;ed, and he will perform: See, upon this &s;ubject, Deut. xv. 10, 11.&mdash;P&s;al. xli. 1, 2, 3, cxii.&mdash;Prov. xi. 24, 25, 26. xiv. 31. xix. 17. xxii. 9.&mdash;St. Matth. vi. 3, 4, x. 42.&mdash;St. Luke vi. 38. xii. 33. xiv. 12, 13, 14.&mdash;2 Cor. viii. 9.&mdash;1 Tim. vi. 17, 18, 19&mdash;and many other places.</P>

<P>All this is plain and ea&s;y: But how any text in this beautiful chain, &s;hould ever have been thought to have any allu&s;ion to the &s;tate of &s;ouls departed, or brought as a proof that no alteration can take place after death, I cannot conceive. But, allow|ing it to have any relation at all to a future &s;tate, it cannot then in the lea&s;t di&s;prove, that very ma|terial changes may happen to &s;ouls in the &s;piritual world; &s;ince a tree cut down by its owner, lies not long in the &s;ame po&s;ition in which it falls, but is applied to various u&s;es, according to its fitne&s;s and his plea&s;ure. But as this is nothing to the purpo&s;e, I think I have taken too much pains here already; and I &s;hould have &s;aid little or nothing upon this part of the objection, were it not con|tinually urged, as though the whole controver&s;y turned and terminated upon this allu&s;ion, than which, nothing &s;eems farther from the meaning of the text; which, in its true &s;en&s;e, appears to be this&mdash;That as certainly as full clouds mu&s;t empty them&s;elves upon the terraqueous globe, and that every thing is <HI>what it is,</HI> and <HI>where it is,</HI> and no where el&s;e; and as a tree falling to the &s;outh, does not fall and lie to the north; and, <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> &s;o, with the &s;ame certainty, &s;hall liberality be ble&s;t and rewarded.</P>

<P>I have nothing to object to what you have &s;aid upon the text; it appears natural. I formerly thought it intended, that as per&s;ons were laid in the grave, &s;o they &s;hould ri&s;e, and that there could be no change after death; but I am fully convinced, that this belongs not to the &s;ubject.

<P>It is evident that the wi&s;e man, in this and many other of his ob&s;ervations, only con&s;ider|ed things with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent life, without any regard to a future &s;tate. In this view, his de|clarations are con&s;i&s;tent with truth; but in no other. Let the following &s;erve as a &s;pecimen:&mdash;'No man knoweth either love or hatred, by all that is before them. All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous and to the wick|ed; to the good, and to the clean, and to the un|clean; to him that &s;acrificeth, and to him that &s;a|crificeth not; as is the good, &s;o is the &s;inner; and he that &s;weareth, as he that feareth an oath,' ver. 1, 2.&mdash;Nothing could po&s;&s;ibly be more fal&s;e than the&s;e ob&s;ervations, applied to a future &s;tate, though they are generally true in this life; for if there are no future rewards and puni&s;hments, no &s;tate of retribution hereafter, there is an end to all re|ligion. But he does not finally leave the matter &s;o; but makes a mo&s;t excellent conclu&s;ion to this book; &s;aying&mdash;</P>
<P>'Let us hear the conclu&s;ion of the whole mat|ter: Fear (<HI>or</HI> revere) GOD, and keep his command|ments: for this is the whole duty of man. For

GOD &s;hall bring every work into judgment, with every &s;ecret thing; whether it be good, or whether it be evil, chap. xii. 13, 14.</P>
<P>Thus, it is plain, that a living dog is better (more u&s;eful in this world) than a dead lion; which is no longer capable of doing good or evil; that a man, when he dies, lo&s;es all hopes of en|joyment in this life, and is rendered incapable of exerci&s;ing the functions of it any longer; has no more a portion in any thing belonging thereto. Thus, in fine, all the ob&s;ervations that can be fairly made, upon this and &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages, belong en|tirely to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things; and, there|fore do not at all affect the argument, either one way or the other.</P>

<P>Indeed I am convinced, that no circum|&s;tance preceding the general judgment, can affect the argument; becau&s;e we are informed, that the condemnation of the wicked &s;hall be at that day; then GOD will render to them according to their deeds, and will &s;ay to them, <HI>Depart from me,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;But the following texts of Scripture form a &s;trong objection to the univer&s;al Re&s;toration, which I would wi&s;h you well to con&s;ider.</P>

&s;ays, 'The expectation of the wicked is wrath,' Prov, xi. 23. 'As he loved cur&s;ing, &s;o &s;hall it come unto him: as he delighted not in ble&s;&s;ing, &s;o &s;hall it be far from him.

&s;tated them in this mo&s;t &s;triking point of light; for though they form no real objection to my views of GOD'S dealing with men, as I under&s;tand the Scriptures, they are an in&s;uperable bar to the opinions of tho&s;e who deny a future &s;tate of retri|bution, which I think impo&s;&s;ible for them to an|&s;wer fairly. I &s;hall, however, notice briefly, &s;ome things in this collection of Scriptures, in or|der that my &s;entiments may appear in their true light.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the hopes of the wicked, ungodly, and hypocrites, &s;hall peri&s;h at their death.</P>
<P>Perhaps they hoped to have lived long, to have enjoyed health, wealth, plea&s;ure, and all worldly good, for many years; to have &s;een their children for many generations, flouri&s;hing for a long time on earth; but death de&s;troys the&s;e hopes.</P>
<P>The hypocrites might have hoped that they &s;hould have been accepted with GOD, on the account of their birth, parentage, profe&s;&s;ion, rank among the people of GOD, ob&s;ervation of the externals of re|ligion, &amp;c. &amp;c. all of which vain hopes do certain|ly peri&s;h at death.</P>
<P>The profane and wicked infidel, and practical athei&s;t, might have hoped, either to have cea&s;ed to exi&s;t, or to have found &s;ome way of e&s;caping the threatened puni&s;hment; but death de&s;troys the&s;e hopes al&s;o.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whatever may be the final intention of GOD towards the&s;e mi&s;erable creatures, it is evident they are &s;hut up in a &s;tate of keen tormenting de&s;|pair, or dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and may be fully per|&s;uaded that they &s;hall never be relea&s;ed, of which it is likely they may not have even the mo&s;t di&s;tant
<PB N="178" REF="025050_0234_102D74A128879470">
hope, or the lea&s;t degree of knowledge&mdash;but, on the contrary, be in fearful expectation of more terrible puni&s;hment hereafter.</P>
<P N="3">3. As they have lived and died in &s;in, their de|&s;truction, or mi&s;ery, is certain&mdash;and there is no remedy, that can prevent their experiencing the con&s;equences of their crimes, and &s;uffering the ju&s;t puni&s;hment which &s;hall be inflicted on them, ac|cording to their different de&s;erts.</P>
<P N="4">4. They who live and die in rebellion again&s;t GOD, will be eternally deprived of the glories and honours of the kingdom of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which other|wi&s;e they might have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; will be excluded from a &s;hare in the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, and will be expo&s;ed to &s;uffer the torments of the &s;econd death; which all mu&s;t inevitably &s;uffer, who remain incor|rigible till the great day of judgment.</P>
<P N="5">5. As God hath called, and they have refu&s;ed, it is but rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that they, in their turn, &s;hall cry in vain: yet neverthele&s;s, though he may long delay, he may hear their cries, and deliver them at la&s;t. See P&s;al. cvii. 13, 14, 15, 16.</P>
<P>David, in P&s;alm xxxivth &s;ays, 'The face of JE|HOVAH is again&s;t them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.' Our tran&s;|lators not under&s;tanding, or not entertaining an idea of the future Re&s;toration, add, '<HI>The righte|ous</HI> cry, and JEHOVAH heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.' Whereas the Holy Gho&s;t has put no &s;uch words as <HI>the righteous</HI> into the text there; but after &s;aying, that the face of JEHOVAH is again&s;t them that do evil, to de&s;troy them out of the world, and to make them forgot|ten, and their names to cea&s;e upon the earth, it adds
<PB N="179" REF="025050_0235_102D717AE0130388">
a word that &s;ignifies <HI>crying,</HI> and then &s;ays, 'And JEHOVAH heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles:' See ver. 16, 17. This &s;eems, in|deed, like the doctrine of the Bible, which el&s;e|where &s;ays, &s;peaking of the notoriou&s;ly wicked; 'O my God, make them like a wheel: as the &s;tub|ble before the wind. As the fire burneth the wood, and as the flame &s;etteth the mountains on fire; &s;o per&s;ecute them with thy tempe&s;t, and make them afraid with thy &s;torm. Fill their faces with &s;hame, that they may &s;eek thy name, O JEHOVAH. Let them be confounded, and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to &s;hame, and peri&s;h. And they &s;hall know (as the Hebrew word &s;ignifies, and as it is rendered in the old tran&s;lation) 'that thou, who&s;e name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Mo&s;t High over all the earth,' P&s;al. lxxxiii. 13&mdash;18.&mdash;Here we &s;ee, in a beautiful and clear manner, that one grand de&s;ign of God in bringing judgments, and even what is called utter de&s;truction, upon men, is that they may know that he is JEHOVAH, the true God: and there are but few intelligent Chri&s;tians, but mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be able to conceive hopes concerning all tho&s;e to whom the knowledge of God is promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Though the threatenings in the prophecy of Ezekiel, both again&s;t the Jews and other nations, are uncommonly &s;evere; yet they frequently clo&s;e with this gracious promi&s;e&mdash;'And they &s;hall know that I am JEHOVAH'&mdash;or &s;omething &s;imilar; as will evidently appear to tho&s;e who will be at the pains of examining the following pa&s;&s;ages in that book.</P>

<P>Puni&s;hment, to a certain degree, in|flames and enrages, in a mo&s;t ama&s;ing manner; but continued longer, and heavier, produces a con|trary effect&mdash;&s;oftens, humbles, and &s;ubdues. When Ephraim, of old, bemoaned him&s;elf, he &s;aid thus:&mdash;'Thou ha&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ed me, and I was cha&s;ti&s;ed, as a bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke; turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned; for thou art JEHOVAH, my GOD,' Jer. xxxi. 18. The metaphor here u&s;ed, expre&s;&s;es, in a mo&s;t lively manner, the different effects of the &s;ame di&s;cipline, in its beginning, progre&s;s, and end. When a bullock fir&s;t has the yoke laid on his neck, he frets, to&s;&s;es, and rages exceedingly; but, by a continuance of the di&s;ci|pline, he is &s;ubdued, brought down, humbled, and tamed, &s;o as to become the mo&s;t u&s;eful and
<PB N="181" REF="025050_0237_102D7324BB0CBEB8">
gentle of animals. The &s;ons of Zion are repre|&s;ented as lying 'at the head of all the &s;treets, as a wild bull in a net; full of the fury of JEHOVAH, the rebuke of GOD,' I&s;ai. li. 20. A wild bull, in a net, mu&s;t be a furious creature; &s;o are men, when fir&s;t they are brought under the Divine cor|rection. But GOD knows how to correct men, in &s;uch a manner as to bring them to &s;ubmit to him, in due time; and though &s;ome are &s;o &s;unk in &s;in as not to be reformed, by any means, in this life; yet that is no argument, that GOD is not able to &s;ubdue and bring down the proud and mo&s;t rebel|lious, in another &s;tate, by means that may be u&s;ed effectually there, though they could not be u&s;ed here. GOD &s;ays, by the prophet to I&s;rael. 'Be|cau&s;e I have purged thee, and thou wa&s;t not purg|ed, thou &s;halt not be purged from thy filthine&s;s any more till I have cau&s;ed my fury to re&s;t upon thee. So will I make my fury towards thee to re&s;t, and my jealou&s;y &s;hall depart from thee; and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry,' Ezek. xxiv. 13. xvi. 42. Some &s;ins are &s;o daring and pre&s;ump|tuous, as to provoke GOD to threaten, that they &s;hall not be purged away in this life; and, perhaps, their malignancy may be &s;o great, that nothing that can be u&s;ed here, is able to &s;ubdue them: Thus, when GOD threatened his people, of old, with de&s;truction, they turned his threatenings into ridi|cule: in&s;tead of weeping, mourning, baldne&s;s, and girding with &s;ackcloth, to which God called them; there was nothing but 'joy and gladne&s;s, &s;laying oxen, and killing &s;heep, eating fle&s;h, and drinking wine: Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. And it was revealed in mine ears, by JEHO|VAH of Ho&s;ts, Surely, this iniquity &s;hall not be
<PB N="182" REF="025050_0238_102D74A4C7BBA8F8">
purged from you till ye die, &s;aith JEHOVAH, God of I&s;rael,' I&s;ai. xxii. 12, 13, 14.</P>
<P>Thus, puni&s;hments are de&s;igned for the humb|ling of the proud: but if they fail of an&s;wering that purpo&s;e, as admini&s;tered in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, they will be continued and increa&s;ed in future pe|riods, to &s;uch a degree, as &s;hall bring all down in due time. Tho&s;e pains which produced that rage and bla&s;phemy which you mentioned, were all poured out on hardened &s;inners in the pre&s;ent life; and were &s;o terrible and &s;evere as to produce tho&s;e fearful effects, but not &s;ufficiently &s;o as to produce the contrary.</P>
<P>That puni&s;hment, to a certain degree, produces rage, but to a certain degree beyond, produces &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; may be illu&s;trated by the follow|ing fact, as well as many others, of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>In the former war between England and France, there was one Mr. &mdash;, of Virginia, who was waggon-ma&s;ter-general in the army of the Provincials. He was guilty of abu&s;ing his power, by frequently &s;triking the &s;oldiers with his waggon-whip. Complaint being made, a court-martial was held, and he was &s;entenced to receive five hundred la&s;hes; which &s;entence was executed upon him. When fir&s;t he began to feel the la&s;h, he was exceedingly enraged, and cur&s;ed tho&s;e who had thus &s;entenced him; &s;wearing, that if he lived to be relea&s;ed, he would kill them all, if po&s;&s;ible; for that he valued not his life, in the lea&s;t, but would revenge this di&s;grace, by killing them, wherever he found them; and much more, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. But, before he had received half his puni&s;hment, he declared, that he had not the
<PB N="183" REF="025050_0239_102D73277A063F80">

After his correction was over, he was led quietly away, entirely cured of all his rage; from which he was as much freed by his puni&s;h|ment, as ever an effect was produced by a cau&s;e. He was healed of his wounds, and, I think, re&s;tor|ed to his po&s;t.&mdash;Some time after the war was over, he was pa&s;&s;ing one day over tho&s;e mountains in Virginia, commonly called <HI>The Blue Ridge;</HI> and there he met alone one of the men who had con|demned him, in the court-martial, to &s;uch a pu|ni&s;hment. He put him in mind of it; and told him, that it was now in his power to retaliate up|on him. The other acknowledged that he was in his power; but added, 'M&mdash;, you know you did wrong, and de&s;erved the puni&s;hment you re|ceived; and if you kill me, I declare, that we did right in &s;entencing you to be whipped; I &s;hould do the &s;ame, were it to do again; and &s;o would you have done, had you been in my place.' Mr. M&mdash;acknowledged the truth of it; and was &s;o far from fulfilling his threatenings, that he &s;uffered him to go in peace, highly commending him for his con|duct. Mr. M&mdash; may be &s;till living: he was a general in the American army during the late war, and acquired great honour, for his valour and good conduct.</P>

<P>St. Paul &s;ays, 1 Cor. xiv. 38. 'But if any man be ignorant, let him him be ignorant:' But we can hardly &s;uppo&s;e that he meant without limitation.

And David &s;aith;&mdash;'Let their table be made a &s;nare, and a trap, and a &s;tumbling-block, and a recompence unto them.

Let their eyes be darkened that they &s;hould not &s;ee, and bow down their back ALWAY,' Rom. xi, 8, 9, 10. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of their remaining in a blinded, hardened, and reprobate &s;tate, are &s;tronger than tho&s;e&mdash;'He that is unju&s;t let him be unju&s;t &s;till, &amp;c. for, in&s;tead of <HI>&s;till,</HI> the word <HI>al|way</HI> is u&s;ed; and yet we are informed, that this 'blindne&s;s in part has (only) happened to I&s;rael, until the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles be come in: And &s;o all I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved.' And that 'GOD hath concluded them all (<HI>or,</HI> &s;hut them up together) in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all,' even all whom he had &s;hut up, or concluded in unbelief. And, as I ob&s;erved before, David &s;ays; 'Fill their faces with &s;hame, that they may &s;eek thy name, O JEHOVAH. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever: yea, let them be put &s;hame, and peri&s;h; That <HI>they</HI> may know that thou who&s;e name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Mo&s;t High over all the earth,' P&s;al. lxxxiii. 16, 17, 18. Many other &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages might be mentioned; but the&s;e may &s;uffice, to &s;hew, that often where the words <HI>Let it,</HI> or <HI>Let them be,</HI> in &s;uch-and-&s;uch a &s;tate, they only intend a certain period, until ano|ther di&s;pen&s;ation takes place.

<P>CHRIST, at his coming, will bring every hidden thing to light, and &s;hall take off all di&s;gui&s;es; &s;o that he that is unju&s;t, &s;hall appear unju&s;t; and he that is filthy, &s;hall be di&s;covered: hypocri&s;y &s;hall be no more. 'The vile per&s;on &s;hall be no more called liberal, nor the churl &s;aid to be bountiful,' I&s;ai xxxii. 5. 'Then &s;hall ye return, and di&s;cern between the righteous and the wicked; and be|tween him that &s;erveth God, and him that &s;erv|eth him not,' Mal. iii. 18. The judgment of God is according to truth, and is de&s;igned to make an entire di&s;covery of all per&s;ons, and all &s;ecret things, 'that every mouth may be &s;topped, and all the world may become guilty before God,' Rom. iii. 19. But though judgment has its great u&s;e in di&s;covering, laying open, convincing, and condemning; and puni&s;hment, in de&s;troying, &s;ubduing, and humbling; yet the powerful, &s;av|ing grace of GOD, and the operation of the di|vine Spirit, mu&s;t have the glory of re&s;toring, or creating men anew; and the blood of JESUS mu&s;t clean&s;e their &s;ouls from the guilt and pollution of &s;in.

<P>But the objection may be an&s;wered another way, without any of this rea&s;oning, by con&s;idering the &s;ubject comparatively. Thus: As God only is holy; as none are good but he, in an ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e; as he putteth no tru&s;t in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his &s;ight, and his an|gels he charged with folly; (See Job xv. 15. iv.

18.) and as all intelligences, compared with him, are unju&s;t and unclean; &s;o, tho&s;e who have lived and died in rebellion again&s;t God, and in the pol|lution of &s;in, may remain unju&s;t and filthy, com|pared with the &s;aints, tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els of honour and glory, who have purged them&s;elves. 'But in a great hou&s;e there are not only ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver, but al&s;o of wood, and of earth; and &s;ome to honour and &s;ome to di&s;honour. If a man, therefore, purge him&s;elf from the&s;e (&s;ins), he &s;hall be a ve&s;&s;el of honour, &s;anctified and meet for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, and prepared unto every good work,' 2 Tim. ii. 20, 21. Here we may ob&s;erve, that in our Lord's great hou&s;e there &s;hall be divers ve&s;|&s;els of various kinds, yet all u&s;eful, but &s;ome more highly &s;o than others; that honour and di&s;honour are comparative terms; and that the way to be|come ve&s;&s;els of the highe&s;t honour at la&s;t, is to purge our&s;elves from iniquity while on earth, by obeying the truth. For it mu&s;t appear evident, from the nature of things, that there will always be an immen&s;e difference between tho&s;e who &s;hall be kings and prie&s;ts to God, and tho&s;e who &s;hall be &s;ubdued in the ages to come, &s;o as to be &s;ub|jects, but who &s;hall not attain to that honour and glory, which they &s;hall have who &s;uffer with Chri&s;t here, and &s;hall be glorified with him here|after.</P>

<P>A Preacher whom I once knew, encouraged this wickedly pre&s;umptuous di&s;po&s;ition &s;o far, as, openly, to &s;ay: 'God cannot damn me: He can as &s;oon cea&s;e to be God, as he can ca&s;t me off: even though I &s;hould &s;in ever &s;o much.

<P>I would advi&s;e all men, of that bold, pre&s;uming, &s;elf-confident &s;pirit, to read and con&s;ider well tho&s;e words, in Jer. xxii. 24.

<P>The&s;e kind of reflections are frequent|ly thrown out by the enemies of the Re&s;toration, to ca&s;t an odium upon the doctrine: But if they were to hear a man &s;ay; 'If I am ju&s;t &s;uffered to enter into this kingdom, and am not condemn|ed as a rebel, it is all I wi&s;h; I de&s;ire neither the riches, honours, plea&s;ures, conveniencies, nor even the nece&s;&s;aries, that many of the inhabitants en|joy: all I a&s;k is to be exempted from the pain and &s;hame of public puni&s;hment:' And another was to add&mdash;'I can &s;ee little or no difference between be|ing made heir apparent to the crown, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the privileges, honours, dignities, &amp;c. of a prince of the blood; and being hanged, drawn, and quar|tered, for high trea&s;on; &s;ince even that puni&s;h|ment, painful and &s;hameful as it is, mu&s;t come to an end:' I a&s;k, Would they not e&s;teem both the&s;e men in a &s;tate of in&s;anity, or wor&s;e; entire|ly devoid of all &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on?

to it.&mdash;But, what will you &s;ay to the doc|trine of <HI>annihilation? that</HI> may not be liable to the &s;ame objections as <HI>endle&s;s damnation;</HI> and &s;o the wicked may be puni&s;hed with <HI>everla&s;ting de&s;truction,</HI> and de&s;troyed, &s;oul and body, in hell; and yet, at la&s;t, all beings that are in exi&s;tence may be made happy. The Scripture &s;eems, in many places, to favour this idea; and the works of nature &s;eem to confirm it. For in&s;tance; many fruits and animals peri&s;h, before they arrive at perfection; and why may it not be &s;o with the &s;ouls and bodies of men? they are no where &s;aid to be rai&s;ed to incorruption, or immortality; but to be de&s;troyed, to be ca&s;t into the lake of fire, to be burnt up, root and branch: to be con&s;umed, devoured, burnt up as chaff, thorns, &amp;c. I need not mention particular texts; becau&s;e the general part of the threaten|ings in the Scriptures run in that &s;tile. And I have &s;ometimes of late rea&s;oned with my&s;elf, that the &s;econd death mu&s;t end either in the re&s;toration or annihilation of tho&s;e who were ca&s;t therein; for there &s;eemed &s;omething in <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery,</HI> that &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed my belief, at times. But I could not &s;atis|fy my&s;elf, whether the wicked would be finally re&s;tored to &s;ome degree of happine&s;s, or totally de&s;troyed; and was apt to think the latter, as it &s;eemed a &s;trange figure of &s;peech to call <HI>de&s;truction,</HI> Re&s;toration.&mdash;Pray, have you ever thought upon this matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are but three po&s;&s;ible things that can befal tho&s;e who are ca&s;t into the &s;econd death; either <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery, total annihilation,</HI> or <HI>Re&s;toration:</HI> a fourth cannot be thought upon; and but one of the&s;e can be true. Now, where there are only three po&s;&s;ibilities, of which only
<PB N="200" REF="025050_0256_102D74B531B33888">
one <HI>can</HI> be true, and one <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be true; there are the&s;e two ways of di&s;covering the truth: Fir&s;t, if two of the propo&s;itions are proved to be ab&s;urd, the third mu&s;t &s;tand: 2dly, if one be proved true, the others mu&s;t fall to the ground of con&s;e|quence. I have taken the &s;econd method; and having &s;hewed that the doctrine of the Re&s;toration is not ab&s;urd, and therefore that it is true; con&s;e|quently, the others are fal&s;e.&mdash;But, be&s;ides this way of arguing, there are three circum&s;tances which prove to my &s;atisfaction,<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at <HI>annihilation</HI> is not a truth.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That at the very time that the wicked are de|&s;troyed, they are &s;aid to be tormented with fire and brim&s;tone: and that they have no re&s;t, day nor night; and the continuance of this is for no &s;hort time, (as would probably be the ca&s;e, if the intention of God was only to de&s;troy them out of being) but for the age of ages. Rev. xiv. 10. 11.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They are put to &s;hame, and peri&s;h, that they may know the Lord; as I have noticed before: See P&s;al. xxxiv. 16, 17. lxxxiii. 16, 17, 18.&mdash;and the ob&s;ervations I have made upon the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in the dialogues.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. But that on which I dare venture the whole cau&s;e, is, that God hath ab&s;olutely promi&s;ed to re|&s;tore and bring again tho&s;e whom he hath utterly de&s;troyed.</ITEM>

<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tru&s;t I can, in many in&s;tances: But I will fix upon one that is full to the purpo&s;e, and unexceptionable; and that is, the ca&s;e of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and her daughters, <HI>Gomorrah, Admah,</HI> and <HI>Zeboim,</HI>

who, 'giving them&s;elves over to fornication, and going after &s;trange fle&s;h, are &s;et forth for an ex|ample, &s;uffering the vengeance of eternal fire,' Jude 7.</P>
<P>As they are &s;et forth for an example in their pu|ni&s;hment, &s;o al&s;o in their re&s;toration: For we may certainly argue, that if any of the human race &s;hall be annihilated, the inhabitants of <HI>Sodom, Gomorrah,</HI> &amp;c. will be; as they were condemned with an overthrow, and made an example to tho&s;e who &s;hould after live ungodly, 2 Pet. ii. 6. But the&s;e wicked nations &s;hall have their captivity returned; &s;hall return to their former e&s;tate; and &s;hall be received by <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as daughters, in the ever|la&s;ting covenant: <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and her daughters, more wicked them&s;elves, than <HI>Sodom</HI> and her daugh|ters, &s;hall be re&s;tored at the &s;ame time; &s;hall re|member their ways, and be a&s;hamed; &s;hall never open mouth any more to glory over the meane&s;t of mankind; when the great JEHOVAH &s;hall be paci|fied towards <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> for all that &s;he has done, and towards <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Samaria,</HI> for all that they have done al&s;o, ina&s;much as they &s;hall return from their long captivity, and be given to <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI> for daughters; See Ezek. xvi. 53, 55, 61, 63.</P>
<P>Now, by Sodom and her daughters being re|turned from their long and dreadful captivity, we mu&s;t under&s;tand one of three things: either, fir&s;t, the return of their de&s;cendants; or, &s;econdly, the re&s;toration of the land whereon the cities &s;tood; or, la&s;tly, the re&s;toration of tho&s;e very per&s;ons who were de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>It cannot be the fir&s;t; for there are none of their de&s;cendants remaining on earth: all were de&s;troy|ed
<PB N="202" REF="025050_0258_102D74B6F6CB8AC8">
by fire and brim&s;tone: none of the inhabitants e&s;caped, Lot and his daughters excepted: who were only &s;ojourners, and were de&s;cendants of Te|rah, and relations to Abraham.</P>
<P>As it cannot be the fir&s;t, let us try the &s;econd. A very ingenious gentleman &s;uppo&s;es, that in the time of the Millenium, the Dead Sea &s;hall be turn|ed into land, and &s;hall again become a beautiful, well-watered plain, and be given to the po&s;terity of <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob:</HI> For he argues, and &s;eemingly very ju&s;tly, that as God promi&s;ed <HI>Abraham</HI> all the land which he could &s;ee from the place where he then &s;tood; (See Gen. xiii. 14, 15, 16, 17.) and as the plain of <HI>Sodom</HI> was in &s;ight, it was included in the grant: and, though the Dead Sea now occupies the place where tho&s;e cities &s;tood; yet God's promi&s;e cannot fail: and, there|fore, in the Millenium, the Dead Sea &s;hall be &s;wal|lowed up, and the place &s;hall become a fruitful plain. But whoever will read Ezek. xlvii. 8, 9, 10, 11. may plainly &s;ee, that the waters that &s;hall i&s;&s;ue out from under the thre&s;hold of the holy hou&s;e, &s;hall be brought into the Dead Sea; and &s;hall &s;o heal tho&s;e deadly waters, that they &s;hall be|come fruitful, and bring forth fi&s;h in great abund|ance; exceeding many, like the great &s;ea, which is now called the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> which fi&s;h &s;hall be more u&s;eful for food, to the innumerable inhabit|ants that &s;hall then be in that happy country, than all the vegetables that would grow there, even though the whole place was turned into a fruitful garden.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. 1. Becau&s;e all the other waters in tho&s;e parts, produce great plenty of excellent fi&s;h; and, therefore, need not healing. 2. Be|cau&s;e fi&s;hers &s;hall &s;tand upon the banks of the &s;ea, from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim, places that are well known to be contiguous to the Dead Sea; one of which is nearly at the north-ea&s;t corner, the other at the we&s;t end of the &s;ame. 3. The mar&s;hes, and the miry places thereof, &s;hall not be healed; but &s;hall be given to &s;alt, as &s;pecimens of what the whole is at this time; which barren and dead|ly &s;pots &s;hall remain, as &s;tanding evidences of the truth of Scripture, and the exact fulfilment of pro|phecy.</P>
<P>Thus, as <HI>Sodom</HI> cannot be re&s;tored in her po&s;|terity; there being none remaining on earth; nei|ther &s;hall the Dead Sea be turned into land, in the Millenium; it follows, as the only remaining &s;en&s;e of the return of <HI>Sodom's</HI> captivity, that tho&s;e ve|ry inhabitants, who were de&s;troyed by fire and brim&s;tone from heaven, &s;hall be re&s;tored to a &s;tate of felicity: And thus, both the doctrine of <HI>anni|hilation</HI> and <HI>endle&s;s damnation</HI> fall to the ground at once.</P>

<P>But as it is the &s;econd death, after the day of judgment, that is to de&s;troy the bodies and &s;ouls of the wicked in hell; perhaps, the inhabit|ants of <HI>Sodom, Samaria,</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> may be re|&s;tored before that period, and may not be ca&s;t into the lake of fire.</P>

<P>It is evident by our <HI>Saviour's</HI> words, (for we mu&s;t not contradict any part of the Scrip|tures) that this will not be the ca&s;e: for he &s;aith, That it &s;hall be more tolerable for the land (<HI>that is,</HI> the inhabitants) of <HI>Sodom,</HI> in the day of judgment,

than for the cities where his go&s;pel was preached, and his miracles wrought, and yet the inhabitants remained impenitent: See St. Matth. xi. 24. x. 15. St. Mark, vi. 11. St. Luke, x. 12. From all which pa&s;&s;ages it is evident, that the inhabitants of <HI>Sodom</HI> will be condemned in the day of judgment, and puni&s;hed in the lake of fire; and though their mi|&s;ery will not be &s;o great as that of the inhabitants of the cities where our Saviour preached, and per|formed his mighty works; yet they will be mi&s;era|ble in that day: and, con&s;equently, the return of their captivity is not to be expected, till after the creation of the new earth. Therefore, it is plain, that the lake of fire is not de&s;igned to annihilate tho&s;e who are ca&s;t therein; &s;ince all that are not found written in the book of life, at the day of judgment, will be ca&s;t into the lake of fire. They who&s;e names are in the book of life, will be happy. The inhabitants of <HI>Sodom</HI> will be mi&s;erable, in &s;ome degree; therefore, will not be found written in the book of life; con&s;equently, will be ca&s;t into the lake of fire. They will be re&s;tored; their captivity &s;hall be returned: therefore the lake of fire &s;hall not annihilate them. They are &s;et forth for an example in their puni&s;hment; and con&s;e|quently, in their Re&s;toration.&mdash;I need not pur&s;ue this argument farther: It appears evident to me; and, till it be fairly an&s;wered, I &s;hall add nothing more.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have frequently heard it men|tioned, but as it appears totally void of all foun|dation in the Scripture, it hardly de&s;erves any no|tice. The objections that I feel my&s;elf concerned to treat with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and re&s;pect, and candidly to an&s;wer, are tho&s;e which appear to be drawn from the book of divine Revelation; but if I mu&s;t attend to all tho&s;e which the ingenuity of men might rai&s;e again&s;t the doctrine of the Re&s;toration, I &s;hould not only have a very hard ta&s;k, but &s;hould never know when I had done, and be&s;ides the di&s;|cour&s;e would dwindle into trifling and conjectures, very un&s;uitable to the nature and importance of &s;uch an awful &s;erious &s;ubject. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that this objection is nothing but a ra&s;h unground|ed a&s;&s;ertion, or bold conjecture, without the lea&s;t foundation either in Scripture or rea&s;on, and if I was to a&s;&s;ert ju&s;t the contrary, I cannot &s;ee why my a&s;&s;ertion would not be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer. Ne|verthele&s;s, le&s;t it &s;hould be thought that any ob|jection can be rai&s;ed, that cannot be fairly an&s;wer|ed, and that I knowing the &s;trength of this, would willingly evade it, I will &s;ay a few words upon it. The Scriptures univer&s;ally hold forth the idea, that men will be judged, condemned, and puni&s;hed ac|cording to the deeds done in the body. God will render to every man according to his deeds,' Rom. ii. 6. 'For we mu&s;t all appear before the judg|ment &s;eat of Chri&s;t, that every one may receive
<PB N="206" REF="025050_0262_102D74BAF9CA0588">
the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,' 2 Cor. v. 10.</P>
<P>'And that &s;ervant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not him&s;elf, neither did according to his will, &s;hall be beaten with many &s;tripes: but he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of &s;tripes, &s;hall be beaten with few &s;tripes,' St. Luke, xii. 47, 48. The&s;e, and all the pa&s;&s;ages that &s;peak of future puni&s;hment, con&s;tantly hold it forth as a ju&s;t retribution for the evil deeds done in this life; but never intimate any thing of what this ob|jection holds forth, of puni&s;hment being continued <HI>ad infinitum</HI> for crimes committed hereafter. Be|&s;ides, it is plain that puni&s;hments or corrections are intended to &s;top men from &s;inning, and under the divine agency to take away their &s;ins. 'By this therefore &s;hall the iniquity of Jacob be purg|ed; and this is all the fruit to take away his &s;in,' I&s;ai. xxvii. 9. This is univer&s;ally allowed to be the de&s;ign of troubles and &s;orrows in the pre&s;ent life, and why not in the next &s;tate al&s;o? the Scripture &s;ays nothing to forbid this idea, but much to en|courage it; particularly that awful pa&s;&s;age where the prophet &s;ays, 'And it was revealed in mine ears by JEHOVAH of Ho&s;ts, Surely this iniquity &s;hall not be purged from you, TILL YE DIE, &s;aith the Lord God of ho&s;ts,' I&s;ai. xxii. 14. If then iniquity &s;hall be purged away after death, it is certain that men &s;hall not always continue to &s;in in a future &s;tate, for they mu&s;t cea&s;e to commit ini|quity, before it can be purged away. And though their puni&s;hments may at fir&s;t cau&s;e them to rage, (as we &s;ee is frequently the ca&s;e in this world) yet &s;hall they continue un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he mo&s;t &s;tubborn &s;hall be entirely &s;ubdued and humbled.</P>

<P>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e is another argument of this &s;ame kind, viz. that is not founded upon any particular text of Scripture, which is directly contrary to the one you have been an&s;wering, which I have formerly thought unan&s;werable in favour of the doctrine of endle&s;s puni&s;hment, which is the <HI>infi|nity</HI> of &s;in, being again&s;t an infinite object, con|taining infinite hatefulne&s;s, and ju&s;tly therefore de&s;erving infinite puni&s;hment. Sin is a crime of infinite magnitude, becau&s;e God is a Being of in|finite maje&s;ty and perfection. Every crime ju&s;tly demerits puni&s;hment proportioned to its malignity! and con&s;equently every offence again&s;t God deme|rits infinite puni&s;hment. No mere creature can ever &s;uffer an infinity of puni&s;hment in any limited duration. It follows therefore, that a &s;inner de|&s;erves to be <HI>eternally</HI> puni&s;hed. Farther, every man is under infinite obligations to devote him|&s;elf to the &s;ervice of God, his infinitely glo|rious Creator, Pre&s;erver and Benefactor. To violate an infinite obligation, is to commit a crime of infinite malignity. A crime of infinite malignity, de&s;erves infinite puni&s;hment. Can it ever be proved then that everla&s;ting, or <HI>endle&s;s pu|ni&s;hment</HI> is not the proper de&s;ert of a life of &s;in? I have often &s;aid, That this argument trite and common as it is, never was, nor ever would be fairly an&s;wered; neverthele&s;s, I am willing to hear what you have to &s;ay upon it.</P>

<P>As this argument is often urged, as of the greate&s;t weight, and as you have &s;tated it in its greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible force, I &s;hall endeavour to an&s;wer it fairly, and particularly.</P>
<P>If &s;in is <HI>infinite,</HI> then we mu&s;t a&s;cribe to it one of the perfections of the Deity, which &s;trikes me as &s;omething ab&s;urd, if not &s;omething wor&s;e: <HI>&s;in,</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="025050_0264_102D74BC9A2E1E30">
a <HI>privation,</HI> an <HI>act of a worm, infinite?</HI> Actions must, in my opinion take their denomination from the actors, and not from the objects. Infinite actions, or actions of infinite magnitude require infinite power to perform them. If &s;in is of in|finite magnitude, goodne&s;s it more &s;o, as deriving a power from God to the performance of it. But if you grant that David &s;poke in the name of the Mediator in P&s;alm xvi. you may be at once furni&s;h|ed with a proof, that even goodne&s;s, in the high|e&s;t &s;tate in which it ever was exhibited in the world, was not con&s;idered as of infinite magni|tude by the great performer. 'Thou ha&s;t &s;aid unto <HI>Jehovah,</HI> Thou art my Lord: my goodne&s;s extendeth not to thee. But to the &s;aints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight,' Ver. 2, 3. If acts of goodne&s;s were of infinite magnitude they mu&s;t extend to God, but the &s;peaker, in the&s;e words, be he who he may, David or Chri&s;t, was careful to let us know that he did not conceive his acts of goodne&s;s infinite. And if acts of goodne&s;s are not infinite, it would be highly ab&s;urd to call evil actions infinite, which proceed wholly from the creature.</P>
<P>I grant indeed that there is a pa&s;&s;age of Scrip|ture which mentions the word <HI>infinite</HI> as belonging to &s;in and iniquity, but then it is mentioned in &s;uch a connection as &s;hews it to be u&s;ed as Jo&s;e|phus frequently mentions it, for a very great mul|titude. And t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us it is u&s;ed by many good authors, who certainly do not mean to u&s;e it in the fir&s;t and proper &s;en&s;e of the word. The Sacred Writer, in the pa&s;&s;age alluded to, takes particular care to guard us again&s;t any &s;uch idea, as though &s;in was
<PB N="209" REF="025050_0265_102D7119BA99A9C8">
of infinite magnitude, or even virtuous and righte|ous actions, which approach far nearer to infini|ty, as having their &s;ource from the fountain of in|finite goodne&s;s. For Eliphaz &s;ays, 'Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wi&s;e may be profitable unto him&s;elf? Is it any plea&s;ure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him that thou make&s;t thy ways perfect? Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? Will he enter with thee into judgment? Is not thy wickedne&s;s great? and thine iniquities infinite?' Job xxii. 2&mdash;5. And language very &s;imilar to the above is u&s;ed by Elihu, 'If thou &s;inne&s;t, what doe&s;t thou again&s;t him? or if thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions be multiplied, what do&s;t thou unto him? If thou be righteous, what give&s;t thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? Thy wickedne&s;s may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s may profit the &s;on of man,' Job xxxv. 6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, if they teach any thing, I &s;hould think expre&s;sly declare, that no actions of men can by any means be of <HI>infinite</HI> magnitude, in the &s;en&s;e in which we commonly under&s;tand that word; though their numbers and magnitudes may be &s;o great as to be &s;tiled <HI>infinite,</HI> as the word is &s;ometimes u&s;ed.</P>
<P>You a&s;&s;ert, in con&s;equence of your ideas of <HI>in|finite</HI> &s;in, that <HI>every</HI> offence again&s;t God demerits infinite puni&s;hment. If the ca&s;e be &s;o, does it not tend entirely to take away the di&s;tinction which God hath made between &s;ins of infirmity and &s;ins of malice, &s;ins of ignorance and &s;ins of wilfulne&s;s, le&s;&s;er and greater &s;ins? All &s;ins are offences again&s;t God, and if <HI>every</HI> offence again&s;t God is of <HI>infinite magnitude,</HI> how can any be greater? and thus the
<PB N="210" REF="025050_0266_102D74C060A17848">
di&s;tinctions are entirely de&s;troyed, and, all &s;ins will be e&s;teemed equal, contrary to the whole tenor of the Scriptures.</P>
<P>If every offence again&s;t God demerits infinite puni&s;hment, then it will follow, that God cannot render to any according to their ways, nor puni&s;h them as their iniquities de&s;erve, unle&s;s they are doomed to <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery;</HI> what then will become of all tho&s;e threatenings where God threatens to puni&s;h people for all their iniquities, and yet to &s;hew favour to them afterwards? This is impo&s;&s;i|ble upon your plan, for none can ever receive all the puni&s;hment due to their &s;ins during numberle&s;s ages. Yet if the word of God be true, he can deal with tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors as they have done, and yet be gracious to them afterwards, 'For thus &s;aith Adonai JEHOVAH, I will even deal with thee as thou ha&s;t done, which ha&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed the oath in breaking the covenant. Neverthele&s;s, I will re|member my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will e&s;tabli&s;h unto thee an everla&s;ting covenant.&mdash;That thou maye&s;t remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more becau&s;e of thy &s;hame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou ha&s;t done, &s;aith Adonai JE|HOVAH,' Ezek. xvi. 59, 60, 63.</P>
<P>Here is an in&s;tance to the purpo&s;e, of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ins were of the deepe&s;t die, and to whom God threatens to deal as they had done, and to puni&s;h them for all their numerous and aggravated tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and yet to remember mercy for them afterwards, and to be pacified towards them for all that they had done. All which things would be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, according to your ideas. In many other parts of Scripture God promi&s;es to
<PB N="211" REF="025050_0267_102D74BED0AC5F20">
render to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors according to their works and ways, and ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be afterwards gracious unto them. And in one place, at lea&s;t, where God is declaring the great mercies which he will manife&s;t unto the children of I&s;rael, in returning them to their own land, and cau&s;ing them to dwell &s;afely therein, he &s;ays, 'And fir&s;t, I will recompen&s;e their iniquity, and their &s;in <HI>double:</HI> becau&s;e they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inherit|ance with the carca&s;es of their dete&s;table and abo|minable things,' Jer. xvi. 18. What do you think of this? If every offence is of infinite magnitude, and de&s;erves infinite puni&s;hment, which can never be fully executed, then how can God puni&s;h a people for <HI>all</HI> their iniquiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and <HI>do</HI> to the greate&s;t &s;inners <HI>as</HI> they have <HI>done,</HI> yea, and recompence their iniquity, and their &s;in <HI>double</HI> fir&s;t, and then be gracious to them, and love them, and be paci|fied towards them afterwards? And the prophet I&s;aiah &s;ays, 'Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, &s;aith your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jeru|&s;alem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accom|pli&s;hed, that her iniquity is pardoned; for &s;he hath received of the LORD'S hand DOUBLE FOR ALL HER SINS,' I&s;ai. xl. 1, 2. Here a fact is &s;aid to be accompli&s;hed, which upon your &s;cheme can ne|ver be done to all <HI>eternity;</HI> for if every offence again&s;t God is of infinite magnitude, and de|&s;erves infinite puni&s;hment, none can ever have re|ceived <HI>&s;ingle</HI> for <HI>one</HI> of their <HI>&s;ins,</HI> far le&s;s DOUBLE for ALL.</P>
<P>And therefore nothing can po&s;&s;ibly be more evidently contrary to Scripture than your trite and common argument, that as, every &s;in is of infi|nite magnitude, &s;o it ju&s;tly demerits infinite pu|ni&s;hment,
<PB N="212" REF="025050_0268_102D74C23AA0D9A0">
which as no mere creature can bear, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubject all who are recompen&s;ed according to their own doings to <HI>endle&s;s</HI> mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, If I was to grant you, contrary to Scripture, rea&s;on, and common &s;en&s;e, that every offence is of infinite magnitude, and naturally de&s;erves infinite puni&s;hment: How would you prove from <HI>that</HI> the certainty of <HI>endle&s;s mi&s;ery?</HI> Do you make nothing of the reconciliation which our Lord Je&s;us has made for <HI>all &s;inners,</HI> and for <HI>all &s;ins?</HI></P>
<P>Let me a&s;k you &s;eriou&s;ly, Did not Chri&s;t make a full and complete offering and propitiation for the &s;ins of the whole world? Is it not certain that his merits were far greater than the demerits of all mankind? Is he not the Lamb of God, who taketh away the &s;in of the world? If Chri&s;t died for all men, without exception, as you grant, and removed all their iniquities, and bore them away, and reconciled all to God by his death while they were enemies: much more as he has paid &s;o great a price for their ran&s;om, he will recover them out of their lo&s;t e&s;tate, and &s;ave them by his life. 'Where &s;in abounded, grace did (or &s;hall) much more abound. That as &s;in hath reigned unto death, even &s;o might grace reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,' Rom. v. 20, 21.</P>
<P>I conclude, that let &s;in be ever &s;o great, the grace of God is greater: and if you will have it that &s;in is of <HI>infinite magnitude,</HI> I hope you will not deny the propitiation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which he made for all &s;ins, the &s;ame character. There|fore if you magnify &s;in, and in&s;i&s;t upon the great|ne&s;s of its demerit, I will endeavour to magnify
<PB N="213" REF="025050_0269_102D74D92895ADD0">
the all powerful Redeemer above it, and &s;peak of his power to redeem all the human race, for whom he &s;hed his blood. And then you will gain no|thing in favour of the doctrine of endle&s;s damna|tion, by all your arguments founded upon the <HI>infinity</HI> of &s;in: Chri&s;t being far more infinite to &s;ave, than &s;in can be to de&s;troy: and as he has undertaken to redeem and bring back tho&s;e who were lo&s;t, there is no danger of his failing to per|form it.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s that what you have &s;aid on this head entirely convinces me, that we can|not found the <HI>eternity</HI> of puni&s;hment, upon the <HI>infinity</HI> of &s;in; and you have given me more &s;a|tisfaction upon many points in the&s;e conver&s;ations than I ever expected to receive. I am indeed at length almo&s;t per&s;uaded to receive your &s;entiments, though I once thought that it was impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer all my objections, yet you have gone far towards it. Nay, I cannot at pre&s;ent recollect any thing material, but what you have an&s;wered. I would not however be too ha&s;ty in adopting this &s;y&s;tem, but after your example con&s;ider it well. But there is certainly &s;omething more grand, beau|tiful, and harmonious in this view than can be found in any other &s;cheme; for both the other &s;y&s;tems end in darkne&s;s and black night, one in <HI>endle&s;s damnation,</HI> and the other in <HI>gloomy annihila|tion.</HI> But on your plan light ri&s;es out or ob&s;curity, and a glorious day &s;ucceeds the darke&s;t &s;cenes. This view of things &s;ets the Book of divine Reve|lation in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing light, and appears, for aught any thing that I can &s;ee, con&s;i&s;tent with the Divine perfections.

it more freely and fully, in your public di&s;|cour&s;es?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the other hand, &s;ome a&s;k me, Why do you ever mention it at all in your &s;ermons; &s;ince it is not e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation to believe it? To them I give the&s;e an&s;wers.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. St. Paul declared to Timothy, that this uni|ver&s;al Go&s;pel of God's being the Saviour, or Re|&s;torer, of all men, but e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that be|lieve, was a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all ac|ceptation; and that they laboured and &s;uffered re|proach, becau&s;e they tru&s;ted in God, as the univer|&s;al Saviour. But he was so far from being a&s;ham|ed of this belief, that he &s;aid to Timothy, 'The&s;e things command and teach,' 1 Tim. iv. 9, 10, 11. And &s;o am I determined to do, at proper opportu|nities; notwith&s;tanding the reproach and contempt awaiting me for &s;o doing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Though it is frequently &s;aid to be a matter of little or no con&s;equence, if true; yet, if it be any part of the record God hath given of his Son, (as I think I have proved) we are in danger of making him a liar, if we believe it not: See 1 John v. 9, 10, 11.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Though you may be Chri&s;tians, and not be|lieve it; yet I cannot; though once I could al&s;o: But now the evidences of its truth appear &s;o plain to my mind, that it would be criminal in me not to believe it; and &s;ince I do believe it, would it not be highly di&s;hone&s;t in me to deny it? I have never done &s;o yet, when a&s;ked; and God forbid, that I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to publi&s;h, what he has commanded to be made known.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. I have commonly acted merely on the defen|&s;ive, and I never &s;hould, that I know of, have
<PB N="215" REF="025050_0271_102D74DB0EE49F40">
preached it in public, or but rarely, far le&s;s have written upon the &s;ubject, had it not been repre|&s;ented as a dangerous and de&s;tructive here&s;y; and people been cautioned again&s;t hearing me, on that account.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. I have been frequently de&s;ired to preach upon the &s;ubject, expre&s;sly; and could not well refu&s;e, without betraying a cowardly di&s;po&s;ition.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. I a&s;k, Who is the be&s;t man; he who preaches the truth contrary to his judgment, for intere&s;t, or to gain applau&s;e; or he that fairly &s;peaks as he thinks, without di&s;gui&s;e; although he knows that it will di&s;plea&s;e his be&s;t friends on earth; even up|on the &s;uppo&s;ition that he errs, in many points? If there be an heretic in the world, it is the man, who, for the love of money or applau&s;e, or through the fear of man, preaches that to others which he him&s;elf doth not believe. 'He that is &s;uch, is &s;ub|verted, and &s;inneth; being condemned of him&s;elf,' Tit. iii. 11.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. If we are to hold forth nothing to mankind, but what all are agreed in, we mu&s;t di&s;course upon very few &s;ubjects: for I do not recollect &s;o much as one, but what people either di&s;agree about the thing it&s;elf, or the manner of explaining and hold|ing it: No! not even the being and perfections of God: nor any point of doctrinal, experimental, or even practical religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. We are to endeavour to teach mankind what they know not, as well as to confirm them in what they are already taught; &s;hould keep back nothing that may be profitable to them; &s;hould give meat to &s;trong men, as well as milk to babes, and &s;hould not &s;hun to declare the <HI>whole</HI> coun&s;el of God. We ought to ju&s;tify the ways of God to men, to &s;hew
<PB N="216" REF="025050_0272_102D74C6084B8CE8">
the nece&s;&s;ity and harmony of Divine Revelation, and take pains to convert infidels; all which things are more promoted by this view than any other.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As to your que&s;tion, why I do not dwell more upon it? I an&s;wer:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. There are a thou&s;and other &s;ubjects in the Bi|ble, be&s;ides this; and all de&s;erve con&s;ideration, ac|cording to their weight and importance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I have an utter aver&s;ion to going always in the &s;ame round of matter or manner; and, therefore I frequently vary in both.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. There are many other &s;ubjects of more pre|&s;ent importance than the belief of this; &s;uch as, re|pentance, faith, hope, love, obedience, &amp;c. and therefore ought to be more frequently in&s;i&s;ted on, in proportion to their pre&s;ent u&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. There are many &s;cenes of providence and grace to take place in the univer&s;e, before the ge|neral Re&s;toration; &s;uch as the Millenium, the call|ing of the Jews, the univer&s;al &s;pread of the go&s;|pel through the earth, &amp;c. The&s;e things are much nearer, and therefore the Scripture &s;peaks more of them; and what God mo&s;t &s;peaks of, in his word, we &s;hould di&s;cour&s;e of mo&s;t to the people.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. This doctrine, though it may have its u&s;e in converting men; and certainly enables tho&s;e who believe it, to &s;et forth the terrors of the Lord, and his mercies, in a more &s;triking manner than other|wi&s;e they could; yet it is chiefly u&s;eful in com|forting the people of God, and, in part, relieving them from that bitter angui&s;h which their tender minds feel, from the con&s;ideration of the va&s;t num|bers that peri&s;h; and, therefore, may not be &s;o
<PB N="217" REF="025050_0273_102D74DD4A52B340">
proper for a popular audience as many other &s;ub|jects.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The plan of this grand Re&s;toration is &s;o va&s;t, includes &s;o many different and &s;eemingly contradictory di&s;pen&s;ations, that it cannot be fairly &s;tated, and fully defended, in one &s;ermon, and e&s;pecially the objections an&s;wered; and many per|&s;ons are not capable of taking in and dige&s;ting at once, &s;o many &s;ubjects as are nece&s;&s;ary to the un|der&s;tanding of this matter, and have not patience to attend to a long &s;eries of demon&s;trations, argu|ments, and proofs; and, therefore, this doctrine &s;hould not be introduced by any man, in any place, unle&s;s he has opportunity to give it a fair inve&s;ti|gation; and, therefore, I never mention it at all, at my fir&s;t preaching in any place; nor unle&s;s I have &s;ufficient opportunities to di&s;cu&s;s it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ays to his di&s;ciples&mdash;'I have yet many things to &s;ay unto you; but ye cannot bear them now,' St. John xvi. 12. And St. Paul &s;ays&mdash;'And I, brethren, could not &s;peak unto you as unto &s;pi|ritual, but as unto carnal; even as unto babes in <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it; neither yet now are ye able,' 1 Cor. iii. 1, 2. 'Strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age; even tho&s;e who, by rea&s;on of u&s;e, have their &s;en&s;es exerci&s;ed, to di&s;cern both good and evil,' Heb. v. 14. Therefore, as the Saviour and his apo&s;tles adapted their &s;ubjects and di&s;cour&s;es to the circum&s;tances of their hearers, and treated them in a gentle manner; &s;o &s;hould we. Prudence, pa|tience, and care, &s;hould always be u&s;ed in di&s;|cour&s;ing on a doctrine &s;o deep and awful as this;
<PB N="218" REF="025050_0274_102D74C7D9C077E0">
and, e&s;pecially, as it hath been &s;o little known of late ages.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. I would wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h well the fir&s;t prin|ciples of Chri&s;tianity, before I meddle with any thing el&s;e: and as to the doctrine of the Re&s;tora|tion, I would rather that it &s;hould &s;eem to be na|turally inferred from truths already known, than delivered as an independent &s;y&s;tem: I, therefore, &s;eldom or ever make it a leading point in my di&s;|cour&s;es; but &s;ometimes lead to it, as a natural con&s;equence of what has been &s;aid. After all, I would chu&s;e that men &s;hould di&s;cover it them&s;elves, by carefully reading the Scriptures, without pre|judice, believing them to be &s;trictly true: by liv|ing in love towards God and man; by walking in humility, often reflecting on their former e&s;tate; and con&s;tantly viewing the &s;ufficiency of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the boundle&s;s love of their great Creator: rather than to learn it of any man, far le&s;s &s;till, of &s;uch an unworthy worm as I am.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. As far as I know my own heart, truth, in love, is my con&s;tant aim. I am unconnected with any party; and am not &s;o prejudiced in favour of any thing that I hold, but that I would willingly be convinced in any thing, by proper evidence; and when &s;o convinced, I am ready to retract pub|lickly: As, therefore, I do not feel my&s;elf per&s;on|ally intere&s;ted to &s;upport the &s;y&s;tem, right or wrong; I have, therefore, dwelt much le&s;s upon it, than mo&s;t preachers do upon their particular &s;entiments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. When I fir&s;t embraced the&s;e views, I was obliged to give &s;ome account of my rea&s;ons; and I cho&s;e rather to do it by writing than preaching: Accordingly, I publi&s;hed my &s;entiments, and an|&s;wers
<PB N="219" REF="025050_0275_102D74DED87A4BE0">
to many objections; which publications be|ing in the hands of tho&s;e to whom I preached, made it le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for me to di&s;cour&s;e upon tho&s;e matters in public, or even in private, as I could refer to what I had written: and with the &s;ame view, I am inclined to publi&s;h the&s;e familiar di&s;cour&s;es, which we have had together; after which it will be le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than ever for me to preach the Re&s;toration publicly; yet, I will not wholly avoid it, at convenient times, and in pro|per circum&s;tances.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. La&s;tly, as I know &s;o much of the nature of man, as to be &s;en&s;ible that he turns, with di&s;|gu&s;t and loathing, from what is perpetually cram|med down his throat; but reli&s;hes that which he falls upon, as it were accidentally, and comes into by little and little: I have always made it a rule never to introduce it, in public or private, unle&s;s where it was earne&s;tly de&s;ired, nor ever to continue it long together; and, above all, never to que&s;tion people upon the &s;ubject, after di&s;cour&s;ing upon it: a&s;king them, &s;aying, Do you believe it? &amp;c. Nor would I ever wi&s;h to pre&s;s them with the argu|ments at once, and oblige them immediately to yield; as this kind of conduct, &s;o far from an&s;wer|ing any good purpo&s;es, commonly &s;ets them again&s;t what is thus intruded upon them. It is the be&s;t way to give time and lei&s;ure to per&s;ons, whom you would wi&s;h to convince; and let them exer|ci&s;e their own faculties.</ITEM>
