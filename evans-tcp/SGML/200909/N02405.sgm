As to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> we can only &s;ay with certainty, that <HI>he was of the children of Benjamin or Judah,</HI> and one of the <HI>chief Captains,</HI> a Collonel or Gene|ral Officer that had Captains under him. But I judge he was not that <HI>Ama&s;a</HI> who afterward &s;ided with <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> and was made the General of his Army.</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of his coming to <HI>David</HI> and &s;peaking as he did, the <HI>Chapter</HI> gives this plain account of it: "That before and after the death of <HI>Saul</HI> many Per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, and men of war fit for the battel, appeared openly for <HI>David</HI> and went over to him; to a&s;&s;ert his right to the <HI>Crown,</HI> and to bring about a <HI>Revolution</HI> in God's time. Among the&s;e were &s;ome of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Benjamin</HI> with this <HI>Ama&s;ai</HI> at the head of them. Upon the notice of their approach <HI>David went out to meet them;</HI> either to &s;hew them the more re|&s;pect and do 'em honour, or rather in &s;ome fear and jealou&s;y of their de&s;ign: For he had lately met with many <HI>treacheries</HI> from his own <HI>Tribe,</HI> and his caution now was wi&s;e and ju&s;t. Wherefore he met them on his guard, and &s;aid to 'em, <HI>If ye be come peaceably to me to help me, my heart &s;hall be knit to you; but if ye be come to betray me to my ene|mies, &s;eeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our Fathers look thereon and rebuke it.</HI> What could be &s;aid with more piety, probity and prudence on &s;uch an occa&s;ion? The wi&s;dom and hone&s;ty of the <HI>man</HI> equally &s;hine forth in this <HI>divine &s;entence,</HI> worthy the mouth of a <HI>King.</HI> My <HI>text</HI> is the an|&s;wer of <HI>Ama&s;ai</HI> unto the&s;e words of <HI>David;</HI> a no|ble and heroic An&s;wer.</P>

WHEREFORE in the next place let us note the <HI>Spirit,</HI> wi&s;dom and fortitude with which he &s;pake: <HI>The &s;pirit came upon Ama&s;ai and he &s;aid.</HI> <Q>The <HI>Spirit of God</HI> came upon him: not the &s;pi|rit of <HI>Prophecy</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Henry.</NOTE>, but a &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and re|&s;olution &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.

Here was the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and might, the &s;pirit of courage and of the fear of the Lord. The &s;incerity and zeal, the vehemence and eloquence are equal; and &s;o the loyalty to <HI>David</HI> and the devotion towards God. It was <HI>&s;piritus audaciae et fortitudinis,</HI> a &s;pirit of fortitude and boldne&s;s, as became a religious <HI>Soldier</HI> and a <HI>chief Captain. David</HI>'s words to him and his company were very moving and en|gaging; and no doubt but <HI>Ama&s;ai</HI>'s heart was full before, what and how to &s;peak when he came into <HI>David</HI>'s pre&s;ence; but he &s;eems to drop all that he had premeditated, and an&s;wers under a &s;udden impul&s;e of Spirit, and as in an exta&s;ie of love and joy; <HI>Thine are we David, and on thy &s;ide, thou Son of Je&s;&s;e!</HI> &amp;c.</P>
