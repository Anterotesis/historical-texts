<HEAD>An <HI>Argument</HI> for AND <HI>Per&s;ua&s;ive</HI> unto the great and important Duty OF <HI>FAMILY WORSHIP.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT having been no &s;mall part of the Honour and Glory of my <HI>Country,</HI> from the beginning of it, that it has been famous for the practice of FAMILY WORSHIP, to which under the Grace and Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD the <HI>Virtue, Religion</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> of it mu&s;t be (if I judge right) very much attribut|ed; I am therefore moved and inclined to look over the <HI>Arguments</HI> &amp; <HI>Motives</HI> unto, and the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> for this great and important <HI>Duty,</HI> and leave them (as they have occurr'd to me) with the Children of my People, that this GLORY <HI>may &s;till dwell in our Land.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Method,</HI> in which I &s;hall di&s;po&s;e my Tho'ts on this <HI>Argument,</HI> &s;hall be this:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To &s;ay what I mean by FAMILY WORSHIP:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To prove it to be a Duty, and &s;how our <HI>Obligations</HI> to ob&s;erve it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To
<PB N="2" REF="003008_0003_0FEF9C89024C3608">lay down <HI>Rules</HI> for the due Performance of it. And</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To urge the Duty with &s;ome proper <HI>Motives.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. By FAMILY WORSHIP I mean, That &s;tanding re|ligious <HI>Order,</HI> and U&s;age in a <HI>Hou&s;hold,</HI> wherein the <HI>Head</HI> of the Hou&s;e doth ordinarily every Day, at &s;tated and appointed Times, call the <HI>Family</HI> together for the performance of &s;uch <HI>holy Exerci&s;es,</HI> as are proper to them in their wor&s;hipping GOD together.</P>
<P>This is a di&s;tinct kind of Wor&s;hip from <HI>&s;olitary</HI> and <HI>&s;ecret,</HI> which is a Per&s;ons retiring by him&s;elf a|lone (into his <HI>Clo&s;et,</HI> Matth. vi. 6.) to meditate, read, pray to and prai&s;e GOD. It is al&s;o a di&s;tinct thing from <HI>public</HI> Wor&s;hip, in Church A&s;&s;emblies and Congregations, for the Admini&s;tration of In&s;tituted Ordinances. So likewi&s;e it is diver&s;e from the <HI>private Meetings</HI> of religious People at one anothers Hou&s;es, occa&s;ionally to pray together and hear the Word.</P>
<P>There are parts of <HI>In&s;tituted</HI> Wor&s;hip, that do by no means belong to Family Wor&s;hip. GOD never meant the <HI>Sacraments of the New Te&s;tament</HI> to be ad|mini&s;tred by Ma&s;ters of Families in their hou&s;es. The&s;e belong to the public Mini&s;try of Religion in the Churches of CHRIST. And excepting Ca&s;es of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> or in times of <HI>per&s;ecution,</HI> there can be no pretence for the Admini&s;tration of <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> or the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> in private Hou&s;es. And then the Ad|mini&s;tration &s;hould be by a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> of CHRIST, and to more than a private hou&s;hold. Wherefore Sacra|mental Admini&s;trations are no part of <HI>Family Wor&s;hip.</HI> &mdash; Nor is there any Argument from the Sacraments of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> to tho&s;e of the <HI>New. Circumci|&s;ion</HI> and the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over</HI> were in their In&s;titution a kind of Family Ordinances; but &s;o were not the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of CHRIST and his <HI>Supper.</HI></P>
<P>Only the Exerci&s;es and Duties of <HI>natural Wor&s;hip</HI> are proper to Families, as &s;uch. Natural Wor&s;hip is
<PB N="3" REF="003008_0004_0FEF9C8E8DD9A398">that which the Con&s;ideration of the Being and Per|fections of GOD dictate to the Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience of Man. <HI>This</HI> al&s;o belongs both to public and &s;ecret Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><HI>Prayer and Prai&s;e;</HI> Adoration and Thank&s;giving; Confe&s;&s;ion, Supplications and Interce&s;&s;ion; are pro|per and nece&s;&s;ary parts of Family Wor&s;hip. So is <HI>reading the Word</HI> of GOD to our Hou&s;holds<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Deut. vi. 6, 7. 1 Tim. iv. 5.</NOTE>.

The&s;e are the principal religious <HI>Exerci&s;es,</HI> that do properly belong to the Wor&s;hip of GOD in our Hou&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">II. Now to &s;hew our <HI>Obligation</HI> thus to wor&s;hip GOD with our Hou&s;holds, I &s;hall argue
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. from the light of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and natural Con&s;cience,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. from <HI>Scripture</HI> Revelations.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. As to the light of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and natural Con&s;ci|ence, it is indeed very <HI>hard,</HI> for us who enjoy the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> to &s;ay, What the bare light of Nature and Rea&s;on, in this our <HI>fallen</HI> &s;tate would teach us. We are &s;o <HI>alienated from the Life of God thro' the Ignorance that is in us, by rea&s;on of the Blindne&s;s of our hearts,</HI> that probably no one of us would have had a tho't of wor&s;hiping GOD with our Families, had we been born and bred <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Salvages.</HI> But yet I am confident, that <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> duely exerci&s;ed, and natural <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> hearkned to thereupon, would &s;oon lead and bring Men to wor&s;hip GOD both in &s;ecret and with their Families. At lea&s;t <HI>our</HI> Rea&s;on under the common Illuminations of <HI>Scripture,</HI> is fruitful of Ar|guments for &s;o plain a Duty.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003008_0005_0FEF9C90505E8188">
The light of <HI>Nature</HI> teaches us that there is a GOD, and that he ought to be <HI>wor&s;hip'd</HI> by us, and if &s;ing|ly and <HI>apart</HI> by our &s;elves, why not <HI>&s;ocially</HI> and to|gether? And if &s;ocially, why not in <HI>Families,</HI> which are di&s;tinct Societies? And why not <HI>fir&s;tly</HI> in Fami|lies, which are the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Societies that Mankind came and comes into? For Families are the <HI>Original</HI> of all Societies, and con&s;equently the fir&s;t &s;ocial Wor&s;hip was of nece&s;&s;ity in a Family. This is plain and ea&s;y Rea&s;oning, level to the Capacity of every Child: But how &s;trongly and irre&s;i&s;tibly doth it conclude for the Wor&s;hip of GOD in <HI>Families?</HI></P>
<P>To let in a gleam of <HI>Revelation</HI> here: Who but GOD is the <HI>In&s;titutor</HI> and Founder of Families? He made at fir&s;t but <HI>one Pair;</HI> He put them together and ble&s;&s;ed them. He could have made <HI>many</HI> Fami|lies at once, plac'd them together, and ordain'd the fir&s;t Act of Wor&s;hip to have been from an <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> of men. But it plea&s;ed <HI>the</HI> GOD <HI>of the Spirits of all Fle&s;h</HI> to make at fir&s;t <HI>one</HI> only Family out of which all the Families of the Earth have &s;prang. And why did He this? &s;eeing <HI>He had the re&s;idue of the Spirit,</HI> and could as ea&s;ily have made a million Families at once? Why may I not be allow'd to &s;ay &mdash; <HI>That He might &s;eek</HI> a godly Family, a religious Hou&s;hold! that this might be his <HI>Fir&s;t-fruits</HI> from the Earth, a|mong men! that Families might be <HI>&s;anctified</HI> unto Him for ever, by the rendring of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;ocial Wor|&s;hip in them; and that this &s;acred <HI>Dignity</HI> might be put and entail'd upon Hou&s;holds, that for the fir&s;t <HI>Ages</HI> of the World the <HI>whole</HI> Wor&s;hip of GOD was in them. And &s;hould not his &s;olemn Wor&s;hip continue in them to the <HI>End</HI> of the World?</P>
<P>All the Nations of the Earth own that Families are <HI>di&s;tinct Societies,</HI> and that they have a <HI>Government</HI> of their own; Laws and Rules proper and peculiar to them&s;elves, for their own weal and good Order.
<PB N="5" REF="003008_0006_0FEF9C93C7F46468">Witne&s;s the famous LAW of King <HI>Aha&s;uerus,</HI> directed <HI>to every People after their Language,</HI> both to <HI>great and &s;mall, That every Man &s;hall bear Rule in his own Hou&s;e.</HI> E&s;ther i. ult. Say then, &s;hall he not rule for GOD? and acknowledge HIM in his Hou&s;e with con&s;tant dai|ly Devotions? Shall the&s;e primary, nece&s;&s;ary, uni|ver&s;al, perpetual Societies of Men be without the Adoration, Confe&s;&s;ion and Prai&s;es of GOD in them? Has the great GOD nothing to do with the&s;e Societies, nor they with Him? No? tho' He be the Author, Pre&s;erver, Feeder and daily Benefactor of the Fami|ly? the <HI>Health</HI> of it, and its GOD? Is not the Family what it is by his Providence? can it &s;ub&s;i&s;t a day without Him? And yet no Wor&s;hip of GOD in it from day to day! no <HI>Prayer?</HI> as if it had no De|pendance on Him! Does it indeed <HI>want</HI> no Benefit or Ble&s;&s;ing from Him? nor <HI>expect</HI> any? that it craves none! And does it <HI>receive</HI> none from day to day? that there are no daily Offerings of <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> in the Hou&s;e! Or does GOD indeed keep and feed the Fa|mily from year to year; and has He no <HI>Altar,</HI> no <HI>Sacrifices</HI> in it? but the doors of the Hou&s;e are &s;hut again&s;t Him! He &s;hut <HI>out</HI> of it! This profane&s;s, this <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> is implied in the want of Family Wor&s;hip; in defiance to Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, Can a Society be more <HI>adapted</HI> and <HI>engaged</HI> to wor&s;hip together daily, than a Family is? Is any other Society framed and <HI>formed</HI> like <HI>this</HI> for daily wor&s;hip? living together under one <HI>Roof,</HI> and united in mutual and near <HI>Relations</HI> to each o|ther! and tied together by tho&s;e bonds of Love and Endearment, which &s;hould bind them to GOD, who&s;e <HI>all Souls are,</HI> the Souls of Parents and Children, Ma&s;ters and Servants! &mdash; O with what a &s;acred <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> &s;hould a Man call the Family of his Love together, to wor&s;hip GOD? Can he own a GOD, and love his Fa|mily, and not love to pray with them and for them?
<PB N="6" REF="003008_0007_0FEF9C99DC582A20">Doth not even <HI>Nature</HI> teach this? &mdash; Methinks he mu&s;t be willingly ignorant, who que&s;tions it, <HI>not lik|ing to retain</HI> GOD <HI>in his knowledge;</HI> his Di&s;affection to his MAKER (horrible to &s;peak) overthrowing even his natural Affection to his <HI>Family!</HI></P>
<P>Again, Let Nature and Rea&s;on judge of the &s;pe|cial <HI>Need</HI> and <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of Wor&s;hip in our Families. Are there no Family <HI>Mercies</HI> daily wanted, which GOD only can give? nor any received from Him e|very Morning and Evening, for which Thank&s;giv|ing ought openly to be render'd? And are there not &s;ometimes Family <HI>Sins,</HI> for which the Hou&s;hold have rea&s;on to <HI>humble</HI> them&s;elves together before GOD? And are there not at times Family <HI>Afflictions,</HI> the Rod of GOD upon our Hou&s;e, which call the Hou&s;|hold to <HI>mourn</HI> together, under the mighty Hand of GOD? &mdash; Surely there is the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Rea&s;on why <HI>Fa|milies</HI> &s;hould pray and give Thanks together, in the ca&s;e of Family Mercies needed and received; as there is why <HI>&s;ingle Per&s;ons</HI> &s;hould do &s;o in the ca&s;e of per&s;onal Needs and Receipts.

<P>I will clo&s;e this <HI>Argument</HI> from the light of Rea&s;on, by remembring You of the <HI>Hou&s;hold Gods,</HI> and Fa|mily Religion (if I may &s;o call it) of the <HI>Heathen;</HI> however bruti&s;h and abominable it &s;ometimes was.

<P>Now however they pro&s;tituted their Rea&s;on, and debas'd Religion, vilely acting like fools and bea&s;ts in the&s;e <HI>Idolatries;</HI> yet we may piou&s;ly and ju&s;tly rea&s;on thus with our &s;elves therefrom; That the <HI>Remains</HI> of natural light, and <HI>Tradition,</HI> taught the&s;e mi&s;erable Families of Men, that there ought to be religious Wor&s;hip in their Hou&s;holds. For tho' they <HI>chang'd the Truth of</HI> GOD <HI>into a lye,</HI> yet their Con&s;ciences <HI>bare a Witne&s;s</HI> to the Truth before us, and &s;hew'd the <HI>Work of the Law written in their Hearts.</HI> How <HI>vain</HI> &s;oever the&s;e their <HI>Imaginations</HI> were, and how gro&s;sly &s;oever <HI>their fooli&s;h heart was darkned;</HI> yet their <HI>Hou&s;hold Idolatries</HI> may ri&s;e up in Judg|ment again&s;t the more profane <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and con|demn them.</P>
<P N="2">2. But I come to argue from <HI>Scripture</HI> and reveal'd Religion. Only let me <HI>premi&s;e,</HI> 'That there are &s;ome things, and tho&s;e &s;ome of the mo&s;t important in Religion, both of Doctrine and of Practice, which are &s;o plain from the light of Nature, and &s;uch evi|dent Deductions from the fir&s;t and more general Principles of Religion; that the <HI>Scripture</HI> rather &s;up|po&s;es them and takes 'em for granted, than particu|larly teaches or requires them.

<P><HI>Revelation</HI> would not &s;uppo&s;e Mankind &s;o ignorant or profane, as to need a direct and po&s;itive <HI>Law</HI> for <HI>Family Wor&s;hip.</HI> A GOD, a <HI>Family,</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> for Wor&s;hip, mu&s;t imply and infer Family Wor&s;hip. &mdash; And bear this in mind, That right <HI>Deductions</HI> and true <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> from the Scripture, are ju&s;t and pro|per Scripture proofs. Witne&s;s our SAVIOURS <HI>Argu|ment</HI> for the Re&s;urrection of the Body. Luke xx. 47.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003008_0009_0FEF9CA0AE9C7EC0">
This being promis'd, I &s;hall now gather up &s;ome of the <HI>Notices</HI> and Intimations of the Mind of GOD from his <HI>Word</HI> about Family Wor&s;hip; amounting to a plain <HI>Revelation</HI> of his Will in the matter; and then go over &s;ome Scripture <HI>Examples</HI> for the Duty: In both of which I &s;hall keep to the <HI>Order</HI> of Scripture.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t Family</HI> was &s;anctified to GOD in the day wherein it was form'd and con&s;tituted. When the LORD GOD bro't <HI>Eve</HI> to <HI>Adam</HI> he ble&s;&s;ed them toge|ther, and thereby &s;et them apart for Him&s;elf to be a holy Pair, a religious devoted Family. And the fir&s;t thing we read of in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Family is his <HI>Sons</HI> wor|&s;hiping the LORD in his appointed Way. And tho' it be true, that this was their open wor&s;hiping apart, yet it leads us into the certain knowledge of <HI>Adam</HI>'s wor&s;hiping with them, and of his in&s;tituting them as well by <HI>Example</HI> as by <HI>In&s;truction</HI> and <HI>Precept</HI> in the appointed Wor&s;hip of GOD.</P>
<P>When <HI>Noah</HI> and his <HI>Sons</HI> came out of the <HI>Ark</HI> the pre&s;erved Family made their &s;olemn <HI>Thank-Offering</HI> of every kind. This was indeed as much an Act of <HI>public</HI> Wor&s;hip as could then be render'd to GOD, yet it is as true that it was, and could be, no other than a <HI>Family</HI> Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Afterward the pure Wor&s;hip of GOD was pre&s;erved in the Hou&s;hold and Family of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who as he journeyed from place to place <HI>built Altars unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>and called on his Name</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xii. 7, 8.</NOTE>. His prai&s;e and ho|nour in the &s;ight of GOD was the religious Order of his <HI>Hou&s;hold</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">xviii. 19.</NOTE>. <HI>I know him that he will command his Children and his Hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the Way of the</HI> LORD. GOD gave him the Cove|nant of <HI>Circumci&s;ion,</HI> which was a <HI>Family Ordinance,</HI> for the <HI>Con&s;ecration</HI> of the Hou&s;hold to GOD; and indeed of all the <HI>Heads</HI> of all the Families that &s;hould
<PB N="9" REF="003008_0010_0FEF9CA47A13A918">de&s;cend from him. Doubtle&s;s expre&s;s and &s;olemn Wor&s;hip accompanied the Act of Circumci&s;ion, that <HI>Seal of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith.</HI> Every Family therefore from the loyns of <HI>Abraham</HI> were hereby put in the way of Family Wor&s;hip. For were <HI>the Children holy?</HI> And mu&s;t not the <HI>Parent</HI> &s;ee the mark and &s;ign of GOD'S Covenant put upon them? And yet afterward might he bring up the <HI>devoted Seed</HI> without praying with them?</P>
<P>But to pa&s;s to the <HI>Law of Mo&s;es:</HI> The <HI>Pa&s;&s;over</HI> was the other Seal of GOD'S Covenant from <HI>his</HI> time, and it was a <HI>Family</HI> Ordinance. The <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of the Hou&s;e had this Care laid upon him. Exod. xii. 3. There was a <HI>Lamb</HI> for a Hou&s;e: They eat it as <HI>holy Societies,</HI> in religious manner; it was <HI>a Fea&s;t to the</HI> LORD thro'out their Generations. The Family re|new'd their Covenant with GOD, and were anew &s;anctified to him, in their celebrating this Ordinance of Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Or let us look into the Law of the <HI>Holy Sabbath,</HI> and it &s;eems to ca&s;t a &s;pecial eye on the Religion and Wor&s;hip of the <HI>Hou&s;hold,</HI> laying the Head of the Family under the Charge of GOD in that matter; <HI>Thou, thy Son and thy Daughter, thy Man-&s;ervant and thy Maid-&s;ervant.</HI> &mdash; Look al&s;o into the Laws for the <HI>Fea&s;t of Weeks and of Tabernacles,</HI> and they are given in like manner; Deut. xvi. 10, 14. <HI>Thou &s;halt rejoice before the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD, <HI>thou and thy Son and thy Daughter,</HI> &amp;c. Or look into the Rule for &s;olemn <HI>Mourning,</HI> as on the day of <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> and Supplication, and it runs thus, Zech. xii. 10. <HI>Every Family apart,</HI> and Per&s;on <HI>apart.</HI> Truly it is the Will of GOD that on the Sabbath-day, and upon all days of public Fa&s;ting or Thank&s;giving, there be &s;pecial Exerci&s;es of Religion performed with our Families, as well as in our Clo&s;ets or in public A&s;&s;emblies.</P>

Pa&s;s we now to the Scriptures of the <HI>New Te&s;ta|ment,</HI> and we find there many Precepts and Directi|ons of GOD our SAVIOUR, which do more plainly im|ply and infer the Duty of Family Wor&s;hip.

Men are in a &s;pecial manner apt to be <HI>careful</HI> and anxious how to provide for their Hou&s;holds, how to feed and clothe their Fami|lies; But let Family <HI>Prayer</HI> and &s;ecret Prayer be the Antidote and &s;overeign Remedy again&s;t this &s;ick|ly and painful di&s;order of our Minds. Carry the care of your Families to GOD in daily Prayers. But &s;hall this be only in Secret? Why not al&s;o in Pray|ers with them?</P>
<P>Another place that has a fair A&s;pect on Family Wor&s;hip is Col. iii. 17. <HI>And what&s;oever ye do in word or deed do all in the Name of the</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>giving Thanks unto</HI> GOD <HI>and the</HI> FATHER <HI>by Him.</HI> In the ver&s;e before the Exhortation is, <HI>Let the Word of</HI> CHRIST <HI>dwell in you richly, teaching and admoni&s;hing one another in P&s;alms</HI> &amp;c. And in the ver&s;e after <HI>Wives</HI> are exhorted <HI>to &s;ubmit them&s;elves unto their own Husbands as is fit in the</HI> LORD. What&s;oever there|fore is done <HI>in the Hou&s;hold,</HI> in word or deed, is di|rected to be done <HI>in the Name of</HI> CHRIST, with conti|nual Thank&s;giving to GOD. &mdash; And then in the be|ginning of the next <HI>Chapter, Ma&s;ters</HI> of Families are required to <HI>continue in prayer, and to watch in the
<PB N="11" REF="003008_0012_0FEF9CAB0AB53DD0">&s;ame with Thank&s;giving.</HI> The&s;e Precepts are directed to <HI>Hou&s;holders</HI> by name, to continue in daily Prayers and Prai&s;es <HI>with their Families.</HI> This &s;eems the mo&s;t fair and ea&s;y, natural and genuine <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of the Pre|cept in this place.</P>
<P>Again we are taught and commanded, I. The&s;&s;. v. 17, 18. to <HI>pray without cea&s;ing, and in every thing to give Thanks.</HI> If <HI>in every thing,</HI> then &s;urely in our Families, for all Family Mercies. &mdash; A like Precept we have I. Tim. ii. 8. <HI>I will that Men pray every where, lifting up holy Hands without Wrath.</HI> If <HI>every where,</HI> then &s;urely in our <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> and with our <HI>Hou&s;holds.</HI> This is one of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> places that occur to us. And the <HI>Caution</HI> of holy Hands, without Wrath, is pecu|liarly proper to <HI>Hou&s;holds,</HI> where Angers and Wraths do e&s;pecially unfit for holy Prayers. &mdash; It follows, <HI>Let the Women adorn them&s;elves with Sobriety and good Works,</HI> and <HI>let the Woman learn in Silence with all Sub|jection; for Adam was fir&s;t formed and then Eve.</HI> Which &s;eems to determine the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s meaning in foregoing <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> to Family Prayer.</P>
<P>Moreover, That our <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> &s;hould be places for Prayer, and that there &s;hould be occa&s;ional Prayers with the <HI>Hou&s;hold,</HI> is plain from the Commandment and Direction of the Apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> v. 14, 15. <HI>Is any &s;ick among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him &mdash;.</HI> But is <HI>this</HI> the only Occa&s;ion that there is for &s;ocial Prayer in Families? Should there be Prayer on <HI>this</HI> Occa&s;ion with the Hou&s;hold, and on no other? Or if the <HI>Eld|ers of the Church</HI> mu&s;t be called on this, or the like Occa&s;ion, is not the <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Family</HI> to pray and give Thanks with it on many other Occa&s;ions? And are not &s;uch Occa&s;ions frequently and daily return|ing on us? And if on <HI>greater</HI> Occa&s;ions there &s;hould be more <HI>&s;olemn</HI> and formal Supplications in the Hou&s;e and for it, &s;hould there be no prayers in it and for
<PB N="12" REF="003008_0013_0FEF9CAD399D5FD8">it on <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> and more ordinary Occa&s;ions, returning every day? Or if <HI>one</HI> of the Family be taken dan|gerou&s;ly <HI>Sick</HI> once in the year, or in &s;everal years, and this be a loud Call for the <HI>Prayers</HI> of the Hou&s;|hold; Is not the continued <HI>Health</HI> of <HI>all</HI> the Family from day to day, and it may be from year to year, as loud a Call for the united daily <HI>Thank&s;givings</HI> of the Hou&s;hold?</P>
<P>But to look into the Epi&s;tles of <HI>Peter</HI> and clo&s;e with him. How applicable to Families and Family Wor&s;hip are his Words, I. Epi&s;t. ii. 5. <HI>A &s;piritual Hou&s;e, an holy Prie&s;thood, to offer up &s;piritual Sacrifi|ces, acceptable to</HI> GOD, <HI>thro'</HI> JESUS CHRIST. The <HI>Church</HI> of GOD is a <HI>&s;piritual Hou&s;e,</HI> and &s;o &s;hould our <HI>Families</HI> be al&s;o. <HI>Believers</HI> in CHRIST are a <HI>holy Prie&s;thood,</HI> but in a &s;pecial manner to their <HI>Hou&s;holds;</HI> to offer up <HI>with them</HI> (as well as by them&s;elves in &s;ecret) the &s;piritual <HI>Sacrifices</HI> of Prai&s;e and Prayer. &mdash; See al&s;o I. Peter iii. 7. <HI>Let the Husbands dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the Wife as to the weaker Ve&s;&s;el,</HI> and as being <HI>Heirs to|gether of the Grace of Life, that your</HI> PRAYERS <HI>be not hindred.</HI> The &s;everal <HI>Relatives</HI> in a Family &s;hould live together as Heirs of the Grace of Life; there|fore they &s;hould pray, both together and apart, for one another: But e&s;pecially the Care about the Prayers of the Hou&s;hold lies on the Head of the Family. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that there be Prayers <HI>in</HI> the Family; that the Husband pray for and with the Wife; and why not the latter as well as the former? And the Husband is wi&s;ely directed to treat the Wife with Tenderne&s;s, to bear with her Infirmities, and by governing him&s;elf well toward her to keep up love and peace in the Family; That &s;o <HI>their Prayers,</HI> and tho&s;e of the Hou&s;hold, whether together or apart, <HI>be not hindred.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the <HI>Notices</HI> and Intimations of the Mind of GOD in his <HI>Word</HI> about <HI>Family Wor&s;hip;</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="003008_0014_0FEF9CB239A16EE8">amounting (as I judge) to a plain Revelation of his Will in the matter, and &s;o to a Precept and Injunc|tion concerning it.</P>
<P>I conclude this Head with the Words of the vene|rable Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> on this Argument; "Let me tell you (&s;ays he) that it is <HI>Ignorance</HI> to call for <HI>particu|lar</HI> and expre&s;s <HI>Scriptures</HI> that require praying in Families, as if we tho't the <HI>general Commands</HI> were not &s;ufficient, and did not comprehend this parti|cular.</P>
<P>I come now to con&s;ider the <HI>Scripture Examples</HI> for Family Wor&s;hip: By which I mean what we find related and recorded concerning one Per&s;on and a|nother, bearing a favourable A&s;pect on this Practice.</P>
<P>I might name <HI>Adam, Noah</HI> and <HI>Abraham,</HI> but for|bear, having hinted at them before. <HI>Iacob</HI> was a like godly Wor&s;hiper with his Hou&s;hold, having learn'd it of his pious <HI>Ance&s;tors,</HI> and inheriting the Spirit with the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>Abraham.</HI> He died, as he liv'd, wor&s;hiping with his Sons around him, pouring out Prayers for them, and ble&s;&s;ing them, one by one, in the Name of the LORD.</P>
<P><HI>Job</HI> was a like devout Wor&s;hiper of GOD with his Family. GOD gave him <HI>&s;even Sons and three Daugh|ters,</HI> and as in their <HI>Childhood</HI> he had daily wor&s;hip'd with them, &s;o when they were <HI>adult,</HI> and &s;etled in Hou&s;es of their own, he frequently call'd them toge|ther to wor&s;hip with him: <HI>He &s;ent for them and &s;anc|tified them, offering Burnt-Offerings, according to the number of them all: Thus did Job continually.</HI> The&s;e were his Family Sacrifices, and he was very con&s;tant and &s;olemn in them.</P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> gave his &s;en&s;e of Family Religion, the De|votion and Wor&s;hip of the Hou&s;hold, in that famous and noble <HI>Re&s;olve,</HI> Jo&s;h. xxiv. 15. <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the</HI> LORD. He re&s;olv'd for him|&s;elf and his Hou&s;hold, tho&s;e that were his immediate
<PB N="14" REF="003008_0015_0FEF9CB5BAEDA9B0">Charge and Care, living under his roof. Him&s;elf and his hou&s;e he joyns in the Wor&s;hip, for they daily joyn'd in it. <HI>"I and my Dome&s;tics,</HI> I with them and they with me; I and they together and apart. He &s;pake as the Ma&s;ter and Head of a Family.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;&s;e,</HI> the Father of <HI>David,</HI> was a religious <HI>Hou&s;|holder</HI> and wor&s;hip'd GOD with his Family. <HI>David</HI> &s;peaks of occa&s;ional <HI>Sacrifices</HI> in his Fathers hou&s;e. 1. Sam. xx. 6. They had their <HI>annual</HI> or <HI>monthly</HI> Sacrifices, and why not the daily?</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> had learn'd of his pious Father, and was taught of GOD <HI>to ble&s;s his Hou&s;hold;</HI> i. e. to pray and give thanks with them, to GOD, for his Ble&s;&s;ing on them. This became &s;o great a <HI>King,</HI> and &s;o illu&s;trious a <HI>Saint,</HI> the <HI>Man after</HI> GOD's <HI>own Heart.</HI> Who would wi&s;h for a better Pattern or Teacher? Would to GOD that all <HI>Kings</HI> would learn of him, all <HI>Rulers</HI> imitate him, in the Devotions of their Hou&s;|holds. To be &s;ure all <HI>Saints</HI> will gladly follow his more than <HI>royal</HI> Example. The lea&s;t and <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> a|mong us may have a Hou&s;hold to rule and <HI>ble&s;s,</HI> and has this Authority in his own Hou&s;e, as much as the Prince hath in his. II. Sam. vi. 20. <HI>Then David returned to ble&s;s his Hou&s;hold.</HI> From an extraordina|ry Act of &s;olemn <HI>public</HI> Devotion, from ble&s;&s;ing the Congregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> both as a Prophet and their Prince, he came <HI>home</HI> and ble&s;s'd his <HI>Family</HI> in the Name of the LORD. He ble&s;s'd and prais'd GOD with <HI>them</HI> that day, and implor'd his Ble&s;&s;ing on them. Every Man is a <HI>King</HI> and a <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> in his own Hou&s;e, to <HI>rule</HI> for GOD and to lead in his Wor&s;hip. <HI>He returned</HI> to ble&s;s his Hou&s;e: It &s;eems to &s;peak his Cu&s;tom and <HI>U&s;e</HI> to ble&s;s it. Was this the <HI>only</HI> time? or the fir&s;t or la&s;t time that <HI>David</HI> returned from GOD's Hou&s;e to ble&s;s his own? No, it &s;eems to have been no <HI>new</HI> thing to Him or them. He was wont to do &s;o on <HI>Sabbaths</HI> and other <HI>Fe&s;tivals.</HI> His Hou&s;|hold
<PB N="15" REF="003008_0016_0FEF9CB8F28BF100">no doubt expected Him; and were in waiting to receive his Ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>Michal</HI> alone was out of frame, but not &s;o the <HI>Maids of Honour</HI> attending her.</P>
<P>I will name but one more <HI>Example</HI> from the <HI>Old</HI> Te&s;tament: It is <HI>Daniel. Three times a day</HI> he wor|&s;hip'd GOD openly and &s;olemnly in his Hou&s;e. How el&s;e &s;hould his <HI>Enemies</HI> have known his Practice, or been able to have convicted him as they did? Had it been the Wor&s;hip of his <HI>Clo&s;et,</HI> the Rule ever was and is <HI>to &s;hut the window and the door, and pray to Him that &s;ees in Secret.</HI> But <HI>Daniel</HI>'s daily Prayers were open in the &s;ight and hearing of his Enemies. Doubtle&s;s it was the Wor&s;hip in his <HI>Chapel,</HI> or of his Hou&s;hold together.. Dan. vi. 10, 11. <HI>Now when Da|niel knew that the Writing was &s;igned, he went into his Hou&s;e, and his windows being open in his Chamber to|ward Jeru&s;alem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave Thanks before his</HI> GOD, <HI>as he did aforetime: Then the&s;e Men a&s;&s;embled, and found Daniel praying and making Supplication before his</HI> GOD. Judge if this be not meant of <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Wor&s;hip with his Hou&s;hold, rather than his retired Devotions by him|&s;elf. Neither Morning nor Evening prayer were wanting in <HI>Daniel</HI>'s hou&s;e. They that pleas'd might make them&s;elves <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> of the Wor&s;hip of his Hou&s;e, nor would he change the <HI>Order</HI> of it for the Kings Decree. The door of his <HI>Chapel</HI> &s;tood open for his <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Di&s;per&s;ion and others. He cho&s;e to <HI>die</HI> rather than cea&s;e his Family Wor&s;hip for <HI>thirty days.</HI></P>
<P>From the Scriptures of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> I &s;hall only name our LORD Him&s;elf, and <HI>Cornelius</HI> the fir&s;t-fruit of the Gentiles.</P>
<P>JESUS is the great <HI>Pattern</HI> to his Church; the pat|tern of <HI>Prayer</HI> and Devotion, <HI>alone</HI> by Him&s;elf and <HI>with</HI> his Di&s;ciples. The Families of the Earth are
<PB N="16" REF="003008_0017_0FEF9CBDCDF3BF30"><HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> in Him, with re&s;pect to his <HI>Example</HI> in this point. He has taught them to pray both together and apart. JESUS had a <HI>Family.</HI> He cho&s;e and or|dained the <HI>Twelve</HI> to be with him. Mark iii. 14. They attended him wherever He went, as his pro|per <HI>Dome&s;tics.</HI> Tho' He had not where to lay his Head, yet there was a Family Relation between <HI>Him</HI> and the <HI>Twelve,</HI> of Ma&s;ter and Servants, Teach|er and Scholars. <HI>They left all and followed Him.</HI> He called them his <HI>Hou&s;hold,</HI> and Him&s;elf the <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e.</HI> Matth. x. 25. And as &s;uch he <HI>fed</HI> them from day to day, and eat the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over</HI> with them. Mark xiv. 14. He often <HI>taught</HI> them in private, and <HI>pray'd</HI> with them in private, as his Dome&s;tics. Luke ix. 18. <HI>As he was alone praying, his Di&s;ciples were with him</HI> i. e. He was praying with them, by them|&s;elves only. He was not alone by Him&s;elf, for the Di&s;ciples were with him. It was a Family Prayer. It was neither public nor &s;ecret Prayer, but private with his Hou&s;hold. And &s;uch we may call his wondrous Prayer ju&s;t before his Pa&s;&s;ion, John. xvii. What a famous and glorious In&s;tance was this of Fa|mily Wor&s;hip, on an extraordinary Occa&s;ion? where|in therefore our LORD was the more inlarged and af|fectionate. Thus JESUS is the Pattern for Family Wor&s;hip to all Wor&s;hipers.</P>
<P>And <HI>whom</HI> &s;hall we name after Him? Which of the <HI>Hou&s;hold? Peter,</HI> or <HI>James,</HI> or <HI>John?</HI> Neither of the <HI>Twelve,</HI> tho' doubtle&s;s they followed the Ex|ample of JESUS in this Duty; But let CORNELIUS (a Gentile Wor&s;hiper, <HI>a Centurion of the Italian Band</HI>) have this Honour; as <HI>a good Soldier of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. We have his excellent Character, Acts x. 2. <HI>A de|vout Man, and one that feared</HI> GOD <HI>with all his Hou&s;e, and prayed to</HI> GOD <HI>always. As he was praying in his Hou&s;e, he had a Vi&s;ion of an Angel of</HI> GOD; <HI>behold a Man &s;tood before him in bright clothing.</HI> The be&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="003008_0018_0FEF9CC0B6E81B48"><HI>Expo&s;itors</HI> take it for a pregnant In&s;tance of Hou&s;hold Wor&s;hip. And if &s;o, it was a good Beginning, a good and leading Example, among the <HI>Gentile</HI> Con|verts. He prayed <HI>always,</HI> with <HI>all his Hou&s;e.</HI> It was at the <HI>ninth Hour,</HI> the time of the <HI>Evening</HI> Sacrifice. If it was a Family Prayer, GOD put a double honour on it; By <HI>one</HI> Vi&s;ion he directed <HI>Cornelius</HI> to &s;end for <HI>Peter,</HI> and by <HI>another</HI> he prepar'd <HI>Peter</HI> to go. But above all, He pour'd out the HOLY GHOST upon the&s;e Gentile Wor&s;hipers, while <HI>Peter</HI> preach'd to to them. Thus did the HOLY ONE own and honour the Prayers of <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his <HI>Hou&s;hold.</HI> Let it encourage and confirm all believing Hou&s;holders in the practice of Family-prayer.</P>
<P>Methinks the <HI>elect Lady and her Children</HI> were &s;uch a Family of Devotion; and <HI>Lydia</HI> and her Hou&s;e; and &s;o <HI>Pri&s;cilla</HI> and <HI>Aquila, Nymphas</HI> and <HI>Philemon, with the Church in their Hou&s;e.</HI> Probably their Chri&s;|tian Neighbours might meet for Wor&s;hip at the&s;e Hou&s;es on <HI>Lord's days</HI> and at other times. But doubt|le&s;s the Families were <HI>as little Churches,</HI> and worthy to be &s;o called becau&s;e of the good <HI>Order</HI> and daily <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> of GOD in them. "It is fit (&s;ays <HI>Calvin</HI>) that all the Families of the Faithful &s;hould be &s;o or|der'd as to de&s;erve <HI>this Honour.</HI> "It re&s;ts upon e|very Head of a Family (&s;ays Bp. <HI>Davenant</HI>) &s;o to exerci&s;e his Hou&s;hold in the true Religion, that it may d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">rvedly obtain the Name of a <HI>Church</HI>".

<PB N="18" REF="003008_0019_0FEF9CC24AA99570">a godly <HI>Per&s;on</HI> and his religious Hou&s;hold: Like one of the Epi&s;tles of <HI>John,</HI> to <HI>the elect Lady and her Children.</HI> "It was the Aggravation of the Fault of <HI>One&s;imus</HI> (as One ob&s;erves) that he left &s;uch a Family, and ran away from &s;uch a Ma&s;ter, where he had been well taught both by Word and Exam|ple. <Q>All Families &s;hould be Nur&s;eries of Religion, as <HI>Philemons</HI> was; i. e. Societies in which GOD is daily call'd upon, where he is daily prai&s;ed, where his Word is daily read, and the Sabbaths of GOD are re&s;ted on, and kept religiou&s;ly in the private and public Duties of them:</Q> Where GOD's <HI>Law is in the Heart</HI> of Parents, Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and is <HI>diligently taught unto the Children.</HI> Such Families are Nur&s;eries for the Church and <HI>Table</HI> of CHRIST, to fill them with worthy <HI>Communicants. One&s;imus</HI> upon his Repentance was re&s;tored in this Family, as a &s;inning Member is in the Churches of CHRIST, <HI>above a Servant, a Brother beloved.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have gather'd up the Voice and Sen&s;e of <HI>Scripture,</HI> as truly and briefly as I could, on this important point of Family Wor&s;hip; and have kept very much to the <HI>Order</HI> of Scripture in doing it. From hence have the <HI>Godly</HI> in all Places and Ages of the Church, gone into the practice of this Duty. And all that uprightly practice it have the plea&s;ure, comfort and profit of it. None ever repented of it, or are like to repent of it.

<P N="3">III. I come now to give <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Directions</HI> a|bout the Duty of Family Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="1">1. We mu&s;t be <HI>frequent</HI> and <HI>con&s;tant</HI> in the Duty. Let no day pa&s;s without &s;ecret and family Prayer, reading GOD'S Word, and &s;olemn Thank&s;giving to Him for per&s;onal and relative Mercies. Let GOD
<PB N="19" REF="003008_0020_0FEF9CC50E8BA9D0">have his Dues in thy Hou&s;e, his morning and even|ing Sacrifices. P&s;alm xcii. 1 <HI>It is a good thing to give Thanks unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>and to &s;ing Prai&s;es to thy Name,</HI> O MOST HIGH! <HI>to &s;hew forth thy Loving kindne&s;s in the Morning, and thy Faithfulne&s;s every Night.</HI> P&s;alm v. 2. <HI>My voice &s;halt thou hear in the Morning, O</HI> LORD! <HI>in the Morning will I direct my Prayer unto Thee, and will look up.</HI> P&s;alm cxli. 2. <HI>Let my Prayer be &s;et forth before Thee as Incen&s;e, and the lifting up of my hands as the Evening Sacrifice.</HI> The&s;e &s;tated Exerci&s;es &s;hould never be omitted, without a plain Nece&s;&s;ity con&s;train to it; but in extraordinary Ca&s;es, as tho&s;e of great Affliction and Sorrow, the Family may need to be pray'd with three and four times a day: And <HI>Days</HI> of Prayer may be call'd for in them.</P>
<P>It was Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s declared Judgment, That the Ma&s;ter of a Family ought rather to omit &s;ecret Pray|er in his Clo&s;et, than private Prayer with his Hou&s;|hold. <Q>Family Prayer (&s;ays he) is of greate&s;t Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, becau&s;e each Per&s;on is concerned in it. You mu&s;t rather take up with Family prayer alone, than with &s;ecret alone.</Q> &mdash; Let us not on any little pretence, or &s;mall occa&s;ion, omit this Duty. Let us walk before GOD in our hou&s;es in this daily Cour&s;e. Let us be con&s;tant and &s;teddy in it, like the <HI>Sun</HI> in its Circuit, as Day and Night in their return. As the Sun <HI>ari&s;eth</HI> let us get up to wor&s;hip and &s;erve GOD, <HI>the Father of Light;</HI> And as it <HI>knows its going down,</HI> &s;o let us know and keep our Hour of Evening Prayer.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us be <HI>&s;ea&s;onable</HI> in Family Wor&s;hip. It is doubly <HI>beautiful,</HI> plea&s;ant and profitable in its <HI>Sea&s;on.</HI> Out of &s;ea&s;on it very much lo&s;es its beauty, plea&s;ure and profit. Yet the <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> of Families may cau&s;e &s;ome <HI>Variety</HI> here. One and the &s;ame <HI>Time</HI> will not &s;ure all Families, nor always the &s;ame Family. The <HI>Rule</HI> in general is, When the Hou&s;hold can be be&s;t

<P><HI>Family prayer</HI> &s;hould be rather &s;hort than long. But let it be long eno' to an&s;wer the Intention and de&s;ign of it.

<P>There are times of Family trials and afflictions, e&s;|pecially when Sickne&s;s and Death come into our Hou&s;es, which call us to inlarge our Supplications, with Confe&s;&s;ions to GOD, and Humiliations before Him: Again there are times of Family mercies, which call us to abound in Prai&s;es and Thank&s;givings to GOD: Let Providence lead us, and a Spirit of &s;in|cere Devotion act us, and let the Glory of GOD and the Edification of our Hou&s;hold direct and govern us.</P>

<P N="7">7. In our Family prayers let it be a <HI>Rule</HI> with us, that there be much of <HI>Thank&s;giving</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> in the Duty.

Nor ought Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin, with Supplications for Grace and Mercy, to be ever mi&s;&s;ing in Family prayers. But we are too apt to be want|ing in the part of Thank&s;giving and Prai&s;e, in our daily Devotions, by our Selves or with Others; which is a very ill and ungrateful thing</P>
<P>Our per&s;onal and Family <HI>Mercies</HI> are many and great from day to day, and they call for a religious notice every day.

Chu&s;e not to put your Children in|to &s;uch Families where the Wor&s;hip of GOD is not upheld; and much le&s;s be willing to marry them to &s;uch Per&s;ons who are like to be di&s;inclin'd thereunto. So let us endeavour to pre&s;erve and propagate Fa|mily Religion from Generation to Generation.</P>
<P N="12">12. And la&s;tly, Let all our Family Sacrifices be pre&s;ented to GOD in the Name of JESUS, <HI>in Whom all the Families of the Earth are ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Carry thy Hou&s;hold daily, and all thy Family Wor&s;hip, to the Blood of the great Sacrifice, CHRIST <HI>our Pa&s;&s;over.</HI> Get all the Souls of thy Hou&s;e, and all thy Prayers for them, <HI>&s;prinkled</HI> with the blood of the LAMB. That &s;hall &s;ecure thy Hou&s;e from de&s;erved Wrath, and procure for it all the Ble&s;&s;ings it needs. By Faith in a &s;acrificed <HI>Saviour,</HI> the <HI>Lamb &s;lain,</HI> we may plead, and <HI>wre&s;tle,</HI> and <HI>prevail</HI> for our Selves and Ours, as <HI>Iacob</HI> did. He wre&s;tled with the <HI>Angel of the Cove|nant</HI> for his Hou&s;hold, and was named <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> Go thou, in the Name and Strength of CHRIST and <HI>do likewi&s;e.</HI> He is <HI>a merciful and faithful High-Prie&s;t,</HI> to pray for thee, to breathe in thee, and to <HI>bear away the Iniquity of thy holy Things.</HI> If He <HI>wa&s;h not</HI> Us, our Off&s;pring, and our Offerings, how &s;hall we be accepted by the <HI>Holy</HI> GOD? If he put the <HI>Incen&s;e</HI> of his Merits to thy Prayers, they &s;hall come up be|fore GOD <HI>a &s;weet Odour.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have given <HI>Rules and Directions</HI> about the Duty of Family Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="4">IV. An <HI>Exhortation,</HI> with <HI>Motives</HI> to the Duty, do yet remain. Let us be <HI>exhorted</HI> to the Practice of this Duty, in that wi&s;e and religious <HI>Manner</HI> which
<PB N="31" REF="003008_0032_0FEF9CEC1A8D0EE0">has been directed to. Let &s;uch as are in this holy Practice in their Hou&s;es, be exhorted to continue therein, in the Fear of GOD. And let tho&s;e that are Strangers to the Practice be admoni&s;hed and warned in the Fear of GOD to come into it. And to move both the one and the other, let me plead with them, for GOD'S <HI>&s;ake,</HI> for the &s;ake of their <HI>Families,</HI> for their <HI>own</HI> &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of the <HI>Public,</HI> both in Church and State. &mdash; The&s;e are plain <HI>Motives</HI> and powerful <HI>Arguments,</HI> and &s;hould &s;ink down into our Hearts; both to <HI>convince</HI> tho&s;e that do not daily read the Word of GOD to their Hou&s;hold, and pray with them, of their Sin in this Omi&s;&s;ion and Neglect; and to <HI>encourage</HI> and confirm Others to per&s;evere in this Duty by the Grace of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, <HI>For</HI> GOD'S <HI>&s;ake,</HI> for the Glory of his Name; from <HI>Love</HI> to Him and from <HI>Fear</HI> of Him; to plea&s;e Him, to obtain his Favour, and to avoid his Wrath; let us all come into and continue in this religious Practice of Family Wor&s;hip. The <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD &s;hould be ever uppermo&s;t in our Hearts, and ly with weight there; it being <HI>the chief End of Man:</HI> And all our Endowments, with all the Advantages which GOD puts into our. hands, &s;hould be made to &s;ub&s;erve thereunto. In like manner, Nothing &s;hould come with more force and power on us, to deter us from living in the Allowance of any Evil, or in the Neglect of any commanded Duty, than the <HI>Di&s;ho|nour</HI> we bring thereby to the Name of GOD.</P>
<P>Now what doth the <HI>Glory of</HI> GOD call for from us in our Families? Let us put it to our own <HI>Con&s;ci|ences,</HI> and let our Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding impar|tially an&s;wer. Is it not for the <HI>Honour of</HI> GOD, and for our glorifying Him together, that we daily and devoutly wor&s;hip Him with our Hou&s;hold? And is it no <HI>Di&s;honour</HI> to the Great GOD if he is not &s;o wor|&s;hip'd, day by day? tho' He be the Founder of
<PB N="32" REF="003008_0033_0FEF9CEEF73F2C58">the Family, its Pre&s;erver and dully Benefactor! tho' It is HE has formed the <HI>Head</HI> and every <HI>Member</HI> of the Family; has brought them together and <HI>built</HI> them up into a Hou&s;hold? His <HI>Secret</HI> has been on the <HI>Tabernacle;</HI> his <HI>Candle</HI> &s;hining on it, his <HI>Eyes</HI> watch|ing over it, his <HI>Hands</HI> &s;upplying it plentifully; tho' it is HE that has <HI>girt</HI> it with &s;trength, ble&s;s'd the &s;mall <HI>Beginning</HI> of it, and increa&s;ed the latter <HI>End</HI> of it. Or if it be <HI>afflicted,</HI> its <HI>Afflictions</HI> come not out of the <HI>Du&s;t,</HI> nor does its <HI>Troubles</HI> &s;pring out of the <HI>Ground;</HI> but it is the <HI>Rod of</HI> GOD upon it, which he only can <HI>remove;</HI> or <HI>&s;anctify,</HI> which is far the better. How then can GOD be glorified in the <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> if in every Ca&s;e he be not religiou&s;ly regard|ed in all his <HI>Ways</HI> toward it; and that by all the Hou&s;hold together, as well as every Member apart? &mdash; As our Father <HI>Jacob</HI> in all his Family <HI>Mercies,</HI> and in all his Family <HI>Afflictions,</HI> gave the &s;ame Glory to GOD; in all his <HI>Fears</HI> concerning them, and in all his <HI>Joys</HI> in them. When he look'd upon his <HI>Sub|&s;tance,</HI> his Word was, The LORD <HI>has given me</HI> the&s;e Flocks: When he look'd upon his <HI>Hou&s;hold,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>I pa&s;s'd this Jordan with my Staff, and</HI> GOD <HI>has made me two Bands:</HI> When he <HI>fear'd</HI> for his Family he carried them to GOD and wre&s;tled in Prayer for them; <HI>O</HI> GOD <HI>of my Father! deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my Brother; for I fear him, le&s;t he come and &s;inite the Mother with the Children.</HI></P>
<P>This is to give <HI>Glory</HI> unto GOD as the GOD of our Families. And thus we teach our <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Ser|vants</HI> to glorify GOD with us; to know Him, to love him, and to fear him, to pray unto and prai&s;e Him by them&s;elves alone. This is better done by Exam|ple and Practice before them every day, than any other way we can think of. Not that other ways &s;hould be omitted, but this to be &s;ure ob&s;erved. So <HI>Eleazar,</HI> the Servant of <HI>Abraham,</HI> learn'd to acknow|ledge
<PB N="33" REF="003008_0034_0FEF9CF1B2B9EA88">the LORD GOD of his Ma&s;ter in all his ways; to depend on Him, to &s;eek him and give him Glory, in every Affair and Concern of the Family; and more e&s;pecially in the greater and more important ones: When therefore he &s;tood by the <HI>Well</HI> he pray'd, Gen. xxiv. 12. <HI>O</HI> LORD GOD <HI>of my Ma&s;ter Abraham! I pray thee &s;end me good &s;peed this day, and &s;how kind|ne&s;s to my Ma&s;ter Abraham: Behold I &s;tand by the Well &amp;c.</HI> And when GOD had given him the Token of his Favour which he had pray'd for, <HI>the Man won|dring at the Thing bowed down his Head and wor&s;hiped,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>of my Ma&s;ter Abraham, who has not left my Ma&s;ter de&s;titute of his Mercy and Truth; I being in the Way, the</HI> LORD <HI>hath led me to the Hou&s;e of my Ma&s;ters Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Children and Servants learn to honour and reverence GOD by living in Wor&s;hiping Families. And &s;o GOD has Glory not only from the <HI>Head</HI> of the Hou&s;e, but from many a <HI>Branch</HI> of it; the high|er &amp; lower Members of it. So it &s;eems to have been in the happy Hou&s;e of <HI>Cornelius, who feared</HI> GOD <HI>with all his Hou&s;e, and prayed unto</HI> GOD <HI>always.</HI> &mdash; In a word, By <HI>Family</HI> Wor&s;hip we train up our Families for the Wor&s;hip both of the <HI>Clo&s;et</HI> and of the <HI>Tem|ple;</HI> and teach our Hou&s;holds to pray both in &s;ecret and in public. And &s;o the <HI>Glory</HI> given by Ours un|to GOD in <HI>both,</HI> may be very much owing to the Wor&s;hip in the <HI>Family.</HI></P>
<P>For GOD'S <HI>&s;ake</HI> therefore, and for the <HI>Glory</HI> of his Name, let us be found in the holy Practice of Fa|mily Wor&s;hip: which is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Motive.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> For our <HI>Family and Hou&s;hold's &s;ake,</HI> for our Children and Servants &s;ake, let us not live with|out Family Wor&s;hip; but in the daily and devout practice of it. Let me plead with &s;uch as neglect this Duty, for the precious <HI>Souls</HI> committed to their Care by GOD the Father of Spirits; which ought to
<PB N="34" REF="003008_0035_0FEF9CF50EA033A0">dear to them and for whom they mu&s;t give Account to GOD. Be prevailed on by the natural, &s;trong and tender Love which you bear to your <HI>Off&s;pring;</HI> and by that Care and Concern which you are bound to have for the <HI>Servants</HI> in your Hou&s;e, to keep up the Wor&s;hip of GOD therein.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> tells us, That <HI>if any man provide not for tho&s;e of his own Hou&s;e</HI> (meaning their <HI>Bodies</HI>) <HI>he hath denied the Faith, and is wor&s;e than an Infidel.</HI> I. Tim. v. 8. What an <HI>infidel</HI> Hou&s;e then is that, wherein the <HI>Souls</HI> of the Hou&s;hold are utterly neg|lected; and the Children and Servants are train'd up in Ignorance of GOD, in Irreligion and Profane&s;s; without reading GOD'S Word to them, and without Prayer to Him for them, from day to day? How &s;hould &s;uch Children learn the Fear of the LORD, without which they peri&s;h? <HI>O de&s;troy</HI> not tho&s;e <HI>Souls for which</HI> CHRIST <HI>died;</HI> and which &s;hould be to thee as thy own <HI>Bowels,</HI> and more than &s;o. While you are far from hating their <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> why &s;hould you not tenderly care for their better and immortal Part, their living <HI>Spirits?</HI> Can you pretend that you love your Family, without a religious and godly Care for their Souls?</P>
<P>How did <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Love work toward his Hou&s;|hold? GOD tells us how he lov'd his GOD and his Family; Gen xviii. 19. <HI>For I know Abraham, that he will command his Children and his Hou&s;hold after him to keep the Way of the</HI> LORD. So <HI>Job</HI>'s Love to his <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Daughters</HI> wro't by his fearing for them, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;in again&s;t GOD, and by his calling them to his &s;olemn Sacrifices, which he offered for them. So <HI>David</HI>'s Love wro't, to his Hou&s;hold; even in his <HI>ble&s;&s;ing them</HI> from time to time in the Name of the LORD; and al&s;o in teaching and charg|ing them, I. Chron. xxviii. 9. <HI>And thou S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">mon, my Son, Know thou the GOD of thy Father, and &s;erve him
<PB N="35" REF="003008_0036_0FEF9CF6A682DB30">with a perfect Heart &amp;c.</HI> Every religious <HI>Parent</HI> feels within him&s;elf the moving Words of the great <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>Elect Lady</HI> concerning her <HI>Children; I have no greater Joy than to hear of thy Children walking in the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, How can <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> be ju&s;t to their Ser|vants, as knowing that they have a MASTER in Hea|ven? or how can <HI>Parents</HI> train up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD; if they do not lead them into the Fear and Wor&s;hip of GOD from day to day? But indeed they wickedly neglect the <HI>private Means</HI> of their &s;aving Illumination and effec|tual Calling, Conver&s;ion and &s;piritual Edification. For &s;urely, Parents and Heads of Families are <HI>the Mini&s;ters of</HI> GOD for this within their own Walls, and are to <HI>attend continually on this very thing.</HI></P>
<P>But does <HI>this</HI> &s;eem to be &s;o much as aim'd at, while <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> the Means of Grace, is neglected in thy Hou&s;e? <HI>How knowe&s;t thou, O Man, but that thou may'&s;t &s;ave</HI> thy Hou&s;hold, by the reverend Wor&s;hip of GOD among them? Have you never heard of any that have dated their <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> from &s;uch a <HI>Prayer</HI> in a Family? The excellent <HI>Lady</HI> ASHURST (of who&s;e Piety and great Devotion I was once a Witne&s;s for many Weeks together) was an In&s;tance of this Mer|cy<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Fryday</HI> Evening Lectures in <HI>Ea&s;tcheap</HI> on the Duty of PRAYER. p. 303.</NOTE>. And thou&s;ands there are and thou&s;ands, both living and decea&s;ed, who are ble&s;&s;ing GOD, and will ble&s;s Him for ever, that his Providence di&s;po&s;ed of them into &s;uch Families of Religion. &mdash; On the o|ther Hand, How knowe&s;t thou, O Man, but the want of Family Wor&s;hip in thy Hou&s;e may turn to the lo&s;s and eternal perdition of thy Soul, and of the Souls of thy Hou&s;hold! And then, How will they and thy own inraged Con&s;cience ri&s;e again&s;t thee in
<PB N="36" REF="003008_0037_0FEF95FF8C36F7E8">the Day of Judgment, and condemn thee? Which leads me to the <HI>third</HI> Motive,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> For <HI>thy own &s;ake,</HI> for the &s;ake of thy <HI>own Soul;</HI> for thy Comfort and Peace in Life and Death, and for thy Safety in the Day of Judgment; main|tain the Wor&s;hip of GOD in thy Family. On thy doing thy Duty to GOD, and to thy Family, depends thy <HI>own</HI> eternal Salvation. If thou do&s;t not con&s;ult the glorifying GOD in thy. Hou&s;e, and the Saving thy Hou&s;hold, thou de&s;troye&s;t thy own Soul.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t <HI>watch</HI> for the Souls of your Family, as one that mu&s;t give an <HI>Account</HI> for them to GOD: But what Account can you give of the Neglect of Family Wor&s;hip, and therein of the Neglect of the Souls committed to thy Care? Will not GOD require them of thee another Day? And &s;ay to thee as in I. Kings xxvi. 39. <HI>Thy Soul &s;hall go for</HI> the&s;e Souls if they peri&s;h: Or as it is in Ezek xvi. 20. <HI>Thou ha&s;t taken my Sons and my Daughters,</HI> and ha&s;t &s;acrificed them to Satan, to the World and thy Lu&s;ts. And thus you and yours may peri&s;h together.</P>
<P>Not that Family Wor&s;hip will <HI>&s;ave</HI> a Man or his Hou&s;e; but it is a Means of Salvation that is by no means to be neglected. Nor that all mu&s;t nece&s;&s;ari|ly <HI>peri&s;h,</HI> who are &s;o unhappy as to live in prayer|le&s;s Families; but the lo&s;s of eternal Salvation is en|danger'd hereby. And if a prayerle&s;s Hou&s;holder, and &s;ome of his Hou&s;hold, peri&s;h hereby, his Con|demnation will be the greater, becau&s;e of his pro|fane Ingratitude to GOD, and his unnatural Neglect of his Family. He &s;hall be judged as a profane Wretch toward GOD, and an unnatural Father to his immortal Off&s;pring, and <HI>a de&s;pi&s;er of his own Soul and Ways.</HI> His Off&s;pring and Servants will ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t him, and accu&s;e him, that he never in&s;tructed them by Word and Example in the Wor&s;hip and Fear of GOD, nor in the Care of their
<PB N="37" REF="003008_0038_0FEF9CFDB44E84A8">own Souls. And how will he ever look them in the face? and much le&s;s GOD who put them under his Care? His Guilt will fly in his face, and his own Heart ri&s;e and condemn him. The blood of <HI>Souls,</HI> even of his Wife and Children, may <HI>cry</HI> a|gain&s;t him from the Earth before he die, as the blood of <HI>Abel</HI>'s body did again&s;t wretched <HI>Cain.</HI> This puni&s;hment will be <HI>greater than he will be able to bear,</HI> nor will he be able to &s;ay, <HI>Was I their Keeper? Abel</HI>'s Soul was not de&s;troyed with his Life; but ve|rily a murder'd <HI>Soul</HI> (whether thy own or anothers) will be found a more horrid and hideous Guilt, than any meer murder of the Body, and to de&s;erve eter|nal Death.</P>
<P>And if the Guilt of prayerle&s;s Hou&s;holders may be found &s;uch in the Day of Judgment, what Pain and Terror may their Sin give them in the day of &s;ore Affliction, or in the day of Death? Suppo&s;e this Man upon his <HI>Death-bed,</HI> and his Hou&s;hold gathering about him in that dark hour; how will he take <HI>leave</HI> of them whom he has never <HI>pray'd</HI> with? How will he do then to <HI>ble&s;s</HI> them, or they him? How &s;hall his dying lips pray for them, as <HI>Jacob</HI> pour'd out Ble&s;&s;ings on his Sons, &s;itting up in his Bed? O it mu&s;t be a melancholly <HI>parting,</HI> from a Family that you have never pray'd with! Pray con&s;ider it, and let not another Evening or Morning pa&s;s without a Family Prayer For they or you may <HI>die</HI> before to Morrow: This Night may their or your Soul be required or called away: And can you think of dy|ing and going into Eternity, without having pray'd together as a Family? How do you think to meet in <HI>Heaven,</HI> and live prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing GOD together for ever and ever? Or how can you think of being ca&s;t together into <HI>Hell,</HI> &amp; for never ble&s;&s;ing GOD toge|ther in this Life, come to bla&s;pheme him for ever, and cur&s;e one another eternally, in the World to come?</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="003008_0039_0FEF9D01613CCA00">
But before Death comes, how mi&s;erable are &s;uch Families, &s;uch Relatives, in all their <HI>Afflictions?</HI> What Comfort can they find from one another under them, who have never been us'd to wor&s;hip and pray together? What <HI>mi&s;erable Comforters</HI> are &s;uch like to be to each other? How can they pray for one another or &s;peak of the Con&s;olations of GOD to one another, in the days of their Trouble &amp; Di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P>On every Account therefore, pre&s;ent or future, <HI>for the &s;ake of thy own Soul</HI> pray with thy Hou&s;hold dai|ly; for thy happy and holy Living here, and for the eternal Well-being and Happine&s;s (if it plea&s;e GOD) both of thy <HI>Self</HI> and <HI>Family.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI> and la&s;tly, The la&s;t <HI>Motive</HI> may be taken from our Duty to the <HI>Public,</HI> both in the <HI>State</HI> and in the <HI>Church.</HI> No Man is born for <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> alone, nor yet for his own <HI>Hou&s;e.</HI> We have our Nei'bours Good, the good of our <HI>Nei'bourhood,</HI> of the <HI>Place</HI> wherein we dwell, of the <HI>Country</HI> we belong to, and of the <HI>World</HI> wherein we &s;ojourn, to act for.

Family Wor&s;hip and Government make Places happy, and the want of it makes them mi&s;erable.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Good</HI> is unknown that the <HI>Public</HI> receives; unknown is the <HI>Benefit</HI> to a People both in Church and State, by the &s;erious <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> of GOD in Families.

<P N="2">2. Unknown is the <HI>Mi&s;chief</HI> and <HI>Woe</HI> to the World, to Church and State, from the <HI>Want</HI> of Family Wor|&s;hip and Government. The profane&s;s and corruption that fills the Earth is very much owing to the Neg|lect and ill Education of Children.

<P>If therefore we have any Regard to GOD, to our <HI>own Souls,</HI> to the Souls of our <HI>Hou&s;holds,</HI> and to the Good of the <HI>Places</HI> where we live; to the Weal of <HI>Mankind</HI> and to the Welfare of the <HI>Church of</HI> CHRIST; let us earne&s;tly come into and be &s;tedfa&s;t, immove|able and abounding in this great and important Duty of <HI>Family Wor&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;ider how much you owe it to GOD, to <HI>your Selves,</HI> to your <HI>Families,</HI> and to the <HI>World.</HI> Let the Love of GOD, and of your <HI>Nei'bour,</HI> of your <HI>Hou&s;|holds,</HI> and of your <HI>own Souls,</HI> con&s;train you to this nece&s;&s;ary and rea&s;onable Service: Wherein the <HI>Ho|nour</HI> of GOD, the temporal and &s;piritual <HI>Advantage</HI> of tho&s;e that are <HI>your own Bowels,</HI> and your good <HI>Account</HI> in the Day of CHRIST, as well as the Good of your <HI>Country</HI> &amp; <HI>Po&s;terity,</HI> are all &s;o nearly intere&s;ted.</P>

How can you &s;ay that you love, honour or fear GOD if you do not wor&s;hip Him in your Hou&s;holds? Or how can you &s;ay that you love your <HI>Families,</HI> while you neglect this? At lea&s;t, How can you &s;ay that you love and care for their precious &amp; immortal <HI>Souls,</HI> which &s;hould have your fir&s;t Love &amp; chief Care?</P>
<P>But let tho&s;e that are found in this religious Cour&s;e and Practice be greatly encouraged and confirmed in it, by what has been &s;aid. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>increa&s;e You more and more, You and your Children.

The LORD <HI>loves</HI> the&s;e <HI>Dwellings of Jacob,</HI> loves to dwell in them. The&s;e are his <HI>Bethels,</HI> Hou&s;es of <HI>Prayer.</HI> As the <HI>Ark</HI> in the hou&s;e of <HI>Obed-edom</HI> bro't down the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD on it, &s;o let the <HI>Wor&s;hip of</HI> GOD in thy Hou&s;e do on thee and thine. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>ble&s;s thee and keep thee, make thee fruitful and multiply thee.</HI> GOD has given you <HI>the Heritage of tho&s;e that fear his Name;</HI> the LORD <HI>is your In|heritance.</HI> Your Hou&s;es &s;hall be called <HI>his Hou&s;es of Prayer, among all People.</HI> The Churches of CHRIST and his Mini&s;ters <HI>&s;alute you much in the</HI> LORD.

<P>We <HI>thank</HI> GOD that there are &s;o many <HI>praying Fa|milies</HI> in the <HI>Town,</HI> and thro' the <HI>Land;</HI> and &s;o ma|ny Families of <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> among us that are Exem|plary for this Duty.

<HEAD>APPENDIX. From the <HI>Whole Duty of Man:</HI> CHAP. V. SECT. xii.</HEAD>
<P>A Second &s;ort of <HI>public Prayer</HI> is that in a <HI>Family,</HI> where all that are <HI>Members</HI> of it joyn in their common Supplications: And this ought to be very carefully attended to, fir&s;t by the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of the Family, who is to look that there be <HI>&s;uch</HI> Prayers; it being as much his part to provide for the <HI>Souls</HI> of his Chil|dren and Servants, as to provide <HI>food</HI> for their Bo|dies. Therefore there is none, even the meane&s;t Hou&s;holder, but ought to take this care. &mdash; What choice &s;oever they make of <HI>Prayers</HI> let them be &s;ure to have &s;ome; and let no Man that profe&s;&s;eth him|&s;elf to be a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> keep &s;o <HI>heatheni&s;h</HI> a Family, as not to &s;ee GOD be daily wor&s;hiped in it. But when the Ma&s;ter of the Family hath done his Duty in this providing, it is the duty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Member</HI> of it to make u&s;e of that Provi&s;ion, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;tant and diligent at tho&s;e FAMILY PRAYERS.</P>
