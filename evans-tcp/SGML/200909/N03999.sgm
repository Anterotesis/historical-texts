<P>THe&s;e words, tho' true of the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> yet have principally reference unto Chri&s;t; who going into the Sy|nagogue on the Sabbath day, cho&s;e tho&s;e words for his Text, and preached up|on it to the admiration of his hearers. <HI>Luk.</HI> 4.18. And applied the&s;e words unto him|&s;elf, as chiefly intended, <HI>v.</HI> 21. Other holy men of God had the Spirit of the Lord up|on

them, and was imparted to them, by which they &s;pake, 1 Pet. 1.11. and 2 Pet. 1.21. But Chri&s;t in a more eminent man|ner and mea&s;ure. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 11.2. <Q>And the Spirit of the Lord &s;hall re&s;t upon him, the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, the Spirit of coun&s;el and might, the &s;pirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord. <HI>I&s;a,</HI> 42.1. Behold my &s;ervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my &s;oul de|lighteth: I have put my &s;pirit upon him, he &s;hall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</Q> Yea, Chri&s;t had the Spirit more abundantly than all others, <HI>John</HI> 3.34. <Q>For he whom God hath &s;ent, &s;peaketh the words of God; for God giveth not the &s;pirit by mea&s;ure unto him.</Q> All Believers are anointed of God, have receiv|ed a &s;piritual and holy Unction in &s;ome mea&s;ure of &s;anctifying-grace, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.21. <Q>Now he which e&s;tabli&s;heth us with you in Chri&s;t, and hath anointed us, is God.</Q> 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.20. <Q>But ye have an Unction from the holy One, and ye know all things. Ver. 27. But the anointing which we have received of him, abideth in you; and ye need not that any Man &s;hould teach you,</Q> [the Grounds of Religion which ye have already learned, or any new Doctrines which ye have not already re|ceived]
<Q><PB N="5" REF="004934_0003_100E32B9890ED130">

<P>Be&s;ides this anointing common to all God's people, there is a more &s;pecial Unc|tion whereby certain per&s;ons cho&s;en and called of God to holy employment e&s;peci|ally, are fitted and qualified with Gifts and graces for the better di&s;charge of their Of|fice, in former times typified by material Unctions, <HI>Lev.</HI> 8.12. <Q>And be poured of the anointing oyl upon <HI>Aaron's</HI> head, and anointed him to &s;anctifie him.</Q> But Chri&s;t was anointed in a more large manner and fuller mea&s;ure than any other, being cho&s;en and called and appointed by God to the office of Mediator betwixt God and Man, which no other was capable of or fitted for, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 45.7.&mdash; <Q>therefore God, thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of glad|ne&s;s above thy fellows.</Q> Chri&s;t had a ful|ne&s;s of abundance, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.3. <Q>In whom are hid all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge. Ver. 9. For in him dwel|leth all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodi|ly.</Q> And Chri&s;t had a fulne&s;s of Redun|dance,
<PB N="6" REF="004934_0004_100E32BDCC734568">
that floweth over unto his People. Like the ointment upon the head of <HI>Aaron,</HI> that ran down to the &s;kirts of his garments, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 133.25. &s;o there is a conveyance of grace and &s;piritual gifts from Chri&s;t un|to his members, who is like a fountain, that though it over-flows, yet ever-flows; &s;end|eth forth its &s;treams, and yet is full &s;till, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.19. <Q>For it plea&s;ed the Father, that in him &s;hould all fulne&s;s dwell.</Q> <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.16. <Q>And of his fulne&s;s have all we re|ceived, and grace for grace.</Q> As from the fulne&s;s of &s;in in the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> we have all received &s;in for &s;in; &s;o from the ful|ne&s;s of grace in Chri&s;t the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> all God's people receive grace for grace.</P>

<P><HI>To proclaim liberty to the Captives and the opening of the pri&s;on to them that are bound.</HI>] This might partly refer to the temporal deliverance by <HI>Cyrus</HI> from the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Captivity; but chiefly denotes the &s;piritual freedom from the bondage and thraldom of Satan and &s;in by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>In the&s;e words you may ob&s;erve</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A choice and precious priviledge.</HI> Bon|dage and thraldom is a &s;ore evil, liberty as great a good; but the &s;piritual bondage and &s;lavery of the Soul to Satan and to &s;in, is far wor&s;e than corporal bondage, than Turki&s;h &s;lavery; therefore &s;piritual liberty by Chri&s;t is far beyond (in its excellency and de&s;irablene&s;s) any outward deliverance from bodily bondage.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Per&s;ons that this priviledge is for.</HI> For tho&s;e that are Captives. The ble&s;&s;ings and priviledges that &s;inners have by Chri&s;t are &s;uitable to their nece&s;&s;ity, re&s;toring of &s;ight to the blind, limbs to the lame, health to the &s;ick, ea&s;e to the pained, and liberty

Methinks, I &s;ee one, he is loth to come forth; and another he regards it not. What ails you Sirs? Is a pri&s;on delightful?

<P><HI>I. Doct</HI> UNconverted men are the Devil's Captives, being fa&s;t bound with the chains and bonds of their own iniquity and &s;in.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after the Creation of man, there was a &s;piritual war, conflict, and com|bat betwixt man and the Devil, the place where this war began was Paradi&s;e, in which fight the Devil overcame, and did prevail, not only again&s;t our fir&s;t Parents, but their po&s;terity al&s;o; then was man fir&s;t carried captive, taken pri&s;oner by the De|vil, and doth remain &s;o till he is re&s;cued, redeemed, and delivered by Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Captain of our &s;alvation. Thus wicked Men are &s;aid to be <HI>taken captive by the Devil at his will,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.26; and keepeth them in a peaceable, quiet &s;ubjection to him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 11.21; and dwelleth, worketh, and ruleth in their hearts, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.2. The heart of an unregenerate &s;inner is the Devil's garri&s;on, &s;ort and &s;trong-hold where he &s;its, and acts, and commands like an u&s;urping <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> and the poor &s;inner yieldeth obedience to him without oppo&s;ition or re&s;i&s;tance. Thus

are they al&s;o &s;aid to be <Q>bound fa&s;t in the bond of iniquity and &s;in, <HI>Act.</HI> 8.23. <HI>and are</HI> the &s;ervants of &s;in, and &s;laves to their own corruption and lu&s;ts, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.16. <HI>and</HI> &s;erve divers lu&s;ts, <HI>Tit</HI> 3.3. <HI>and are</HI> the &s;ervants of corruption,</Q> who being overcome by Satan and by &s;in, are brought into bondage by them, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.19.</P>
<P>In the&s;e particulars following, it will appear that unconverted gracele&s;s men are captives and bondmen to Satan and to &s;in.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Captives and bondmen are di&s;armed;</HI> their weapons and armour of defence are ta|ken from them, that they are not able to make re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t tho&s;e by whom they are taken captives and pri&s;oners. Sirs, the enemies of your Souls are,</P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>The enemies of your &s;ouls are malicious as well as numerous.</HI> When the Devil was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his fir&s;t e&s;tate, he envied the happine&s;s of man, and mo&s;t maliciou&s;ly &s;et him&s;elf to endeavour that man might not for ever enjoy what he and his angels with him had for ever lo&s;t.

<P N="6">6. <HI>They are indefatigable or unwearied ene|mies.</HI> Satan hath been employed in this work of tempting and de&s;troying Souls for &s;ome thou&s;and years, and yet he is not weary, &s;o as to de&s;i&s;t, unto this day. This work he began but a very little after the be|ginning of the world, and this will he un|weariedly carry on to the end of the world; whil&s;t there are men out of Heaven and Hell, he will not leave off his &s;oul-detroy|ing &s;tudy and endeavour; and when on earth he &s;hall have no more to tempt, then &s;hall he torment them for ever, that by temptations he hath got to hell; thus like a re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit he is alway <Q>going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it;</Q> going from one per&s;on ano|ther,

from one hou&s;e to another, to and fro, backwards and forwards, up and down, here and there, as one that cannot be at quiet without his prey, <HI>Job</HI> 1.7. &amp; 2.2. <Q>He walks about, &s;eeking whom he might devour;</Q> &s;eeking not to devour Souls one by one, but if it may be by whole families, by whole Pari&s;hes, by whole Kingdoms and Nations; and &s;o he doth too many in the World, where the Go&s;pel and a Saviour hath not been heard of, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.8.</P>
<P>Thus are gracele&s;s &s;inners like a compa|ny of poor unarmed pri&s;oners in the mid&s;t of many malicious, powerful, and politick and unwearied enemies; that do de&s;ign nothing le&s;s than the damnation of thy &s;oul, the lo&s;s, the eternal lo&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed, glo|rious and eternal God, that de&s;ign nothing le&s;s than to bring thee to a place of torment, to a fiery furnace, to a lake of brim&s;tone, to a place of utter darkne&s;s, where there &s;hall be weeping, and wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth, wo and lamentation, &s;hriekings and howlings, and bitter cries for ever and ever. Oh how &s;hould it pity us, to &s;ee the&s;e poor naked unarmed &s;inners &s;urround|ed by &s;uch mighty enemies, carrying them captives to a place of eternal &s;eparation from God, and Chri&s;t, and Angels, and all the Saints of God; to &s;ee them going to

<P>Poor captivated &s;ouls! are you thus in the hands of your enemies, and not one piece of &s;piritual armour to &s;afe-guard your &s;elves? Captives lye at the mercy of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;laves they be; but Satan hath no &s;uch thing as mercy or pity to the &s;ouls of men; ma|lice enough, but no mercy; cruelty enough, but no favour. If God &s;hould have no mercy for you, the Devil will have none. Except the God of Mercy, and pity, and patience had re&s;trained the enemies of your &s;ouls, they would have dragged you down to the bottomle&s;s pit long before this day. There is no armour of proof again&s;t tho&s;e that have taken you captive, but the ar|mour of God: but this is your mi&s;ery, you have not one piece thereof, either the girdle of truth, nor the brea&s;t plate of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, nor the helmet of &s;alvation; and though you may have the Sword of the Spi|rit, the word of God in your hands, yet you know not how to u&s;e it again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of your &s;piritual adver&s;aries. Think then of this, Captives are naked and unarm|ed men.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Captives lo&s;e the riches they had, when taken Captives.</HI> That though they were rich before, yet are made poor, and are &s;trip|ped

of all. If a rich Merchant at Sea have many goods in a Ship, co&s;tly Jewels, preci|ous Pearls, and be taken pri&s;oner, and car|ried captive, he is &s;poiled of all, and lo&s;eth all. Man at fir&s;t was exceeding rich, rich in the knowledge of God, rich in love and likene&s;s to God. The holine&s;s of man was his riches, the enjoyment of God was his riches, the &s;piritual endowments of man at fir&s;t, were not to be valued with the gold of <HI>Ophir,</HI> with the precious <HI>Onyx</HI> or the <HI>Saphire;</HI> Gold and Chri&s;tal could not equal them, they were not to be ex|changed for Jewels of fine Gold, the <HI>Topaz</HI> of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> could not equal them, neither were they to be valued with pure Gold, Coral or Pearls were not worthy to be men|tioned with them, for their price was above Rubies, as <HI>Job</HI> &s;etteth forth the excellency of wi&s;dom, <HI>Job</HI> 28.15. to the 20th ver&s;e. But when man was overcome by the Devil and taken captive by him, he was &s;poiled of all, all was taken from him, that he be|came mi&s;erably poor, lo&s;t his knowledge of God, the image of God, the favour of God, communion with God, the gracious comfort|able pre&s;ence of God, his abode in Paradi&s;e; and though before he was Lord of all, and had dominion over all inferior creatures; yet being captivated by the Devil, he lo&s;t

his right to all, and was turned out of all. So it is with all unregenerate men, whatever be their outward riches and worldly enjoy|ments, as to &s;pirituals they are mi&s;erably poor, very beggars indeed, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17. the true riches they have not, &s;uitable riches for their Souls they have not, durable riches they have not; no man is rich indeed, till he is good indeed and free indeed. God is the free-mans riches, Chri&s;t is the free-mans riches, the grace of the Spirit, the priviledges purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, the promi&s;es of God, the trea&s;ures laid up in heaven, the&s;e, the&s;e are the riches of redeemed per&s;ons; but tho&s;e that &s;till remain captives and bond-&s;laves to Satan and to &s;in, have no intere&s;t in them, no title to them.</P>
<P>If thou that read&s;t the&s;e lines be one of them, whatever be thy outward plenty and abundance, thou art wretchedly poor. Men &s;ay of a poor per&s;on, he is worth nothing; but we might truly &s;ay of the&s;e per&s;ons, they are worth nothing, nay they are wor&s;e than nothing.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Captives are not governed by the &s;ame Laws as freemen are.</HI> Laws are made in favour for free &s;ubjects; but Laws for &s;laves and bondmen are more &s;evere, and to make their yoke more heavy. Souls in &s;piritual bondage and captivity are not governed by
<PB N="23" REF="004934_0012_100E32D6CD00BC40">
the Law of God, which is holy, ju&s;t, and good, made in favour of, and for the good of the Lord's redeemed ones; but by the Laws of &s;in and lu&s;t, which are unju&s;t, op|pre&s;&s;ing, and tyrannical, and oftentimes con|trary one to another, covetou&s;ne&s;s impo&s;ing one thing upon the &s;inner, and prodigality the quite contrary. The Lord's &s;piritual freemen are under the Laws of God, but the Devils captives are under the Law of &s;in.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Captives and bondmen are put to ba&s;e employment;</HI> To toil and drudge, to dig in the Mine, to work at the Oar, very great and hard burdens are impo&s;ed upon them. Thus it was with <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the hou&s;e of bondage, the ta&s;kma&s;ters of <HI>Egypt</HI> denied them &s;traw, and yet required the full num|ber of bricks, &s;o laid hard &s;ervice upon them. But there is no work &s;o vile and &s;ordid and ba&s;e, as works of &s;in; and yet it is the whole and only employment of &s;pritual bond &s;laves, to plea&s;e the fle&s;h and Devil, and gratifie their filthy lu&s;ts. What is ba&s;er &s;lavery than to lead a &s;en&s;ual fle&s;h-plea&s;ing life? What is more &s;ordid drudgery, than to be a &s;ervant of Satan and &s;in? than to be under the commanding power of their own vile affections? to take pains to di&s;honour God that made them? to work and labour to

undo them&s;elves, &amp; damn &amp; ruin their own immortal Souls? Whereas the work and employment of tho&s;e that are redeemed from their &s;piritual captivity, is the mo&s;t no|ble, rational, high and honourable, the mo&s;t delightful and profitable as any can be en|gaged in on this &s;ide the everla&s;ting, full, and perfect &s;tate of the Saints in glory; &s;uch as is our <Q>loving of God, conver&s;ing with the ble&s;&s;ed glorious God, believing on Chri&s;t, applying of promi&s;es, living by faith, hoping, looking, longing for heaven, waiting for the glory that &s;hall be revealed, and for the glorious appear|ing of our de&s;ired and longed for Lord and Saviour, in getting a&s;&s;urance of his love, and &s;olacing and delighting our &s;ouls with the comfort thereof when we have obtained it, in u&s;ing utmo&s;t diligence to e&s;cape the damnation of hell, and the everla&s;ting torments to be endured by the Devils captives in the other endle&s;s world, and getting &s;afe to heaven when we dye, in plea&s;ing God while we live.</Q> Nay, the mo&s;t di&s;plea&s;ing works to fle&s;h and blood are more delightful and &s;weet than any, than all the plea&s;ures of &s;in; as in <Q>mourning for &s;in, weeping bitterly for &s;in, mortifying of &s;in, praying again&s;t &s;in, watching again&s;t &s;in, combating and conflicting with &s;in,
<PB N="25" REF="004934_0013_100E32DAC5DA9C88">
warring with Satan;</Q> yea the very duty of &s;elf-denial, mo&s;t ungrateful to fle&s;h and blood, hath &s;weetne&s;s in it, and bringeth in that peace of con&s;cience which &s;urpa&s;&s;eth the choice&s;t delights of the Devils bond-&s;laves.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Captives and bond-&s;laves meet with hard u&s;age in their hard work and ba&s;e employment;</HI> many times are fed with bread and water, and that in &s;mall allowance too, are whipt and beaten when they have put forth their &s;trength to do their utmo&s;t, they have &s;tripes and blows in&s;tead of reward for what they do. Thus <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in <HI>Egyptian</HI> bondage was beaten when forced to gather &s;tubble in&s;tead of &s;traw, could not bring in the full tale of bricks, <HI>Exod.</HI> 5.14, 15, 16. So the Devil's captives that lay them&s;elves out mo&s;t in the Devil's &s;ervice, &s;hall have their wages; but what? plagues and puni&s;hments here and hereafter, la&s;hes, &s;tripes and wounds. And that,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sometimes from God in this world;</HI> they have puni&s;hments and judgments inflicted upon them by a ju&s;t and righteous, angry God, who &s;courgeth them often in this life for their Sin, and plagueth them for their iniquity. So tho&s;e that are &s;laves unto their lu&s;ts are puni&s;hed with filthy di&s;|ea&s;es in their bodies, <HI>Prov.</HI> 7.22. <Q>He

She hath ca&s;t down many wounded; yea many &s;trong men have been &s;lain by her. 27. Her hou&s;e is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</Q> And this you may too often &s;ee and ob|&s;erve in the Weekly Bills of Mortality, that the&s;e &s;illy filthy &s;laves of lu&s;t are rewarded with the lo&s;s of life. So tho&s;e that are &s;laves to their &s;en&s;itive appetite, and given to plea&s;e their fle&s;h in exce&s;&s;ive eating and drinking are brought to poverty, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.21. and to death, digging their graves with their own teeth. And if they do e&s;cape outward judg|ments on body and e&s;tate, yet they are un|der Spiritual judgments on their Souls, as blindne&s;s of mind, hardne&s;s of heart, lo&s;s of God's favour, under the reigning power of &s;in, which are a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than any bodily plagues, though le&s;s lamented.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sometimes they have la&s;hes from their own Con&s;ciences,</HI> being filled with inward gripes and pangs, with horror and amaze|ment, which they are not able to bear, but cry out and roar, that they would rather die

than live to feel the&s;e inward &s;courgings of their own Con&s;ciences. Tho&s;e two &s;laves of Sin and captives of the Devil, <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Judas,</HI> when they had done the Devil's drud|gery, the one in murdering of his Brother, the other in &s;elling and betraying of his Lord, were &s;o filled with inward terrors of Soul, that the one crieth out "My puni&s;hment is greater than I can bear," <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.13. and would&punc; rather be &s;lain by any that &s;hould meet him, than live to feel the terrors of his Con&s;cience; the other in the angui&s;h of his heart confe&s;&s;ed, "I have &s;inned in betray|ing innocent blood"; and would rather hang him&s;elf and die by his own Hands, and be his own executioner, than &s;uf|fer what he felt in the accu&s;ations of his Con&s;cience, <HI>Mat.</HI> 27.3, 4, 5. thus the&s;e wretched &s;laves of Satan and Sin, are &s;ome|times filled with Helli&s;h &s;orrows before they come to Hell; are not the&s;e then hard wa|ges for the works of Sin?</P>

<P N="2">2.

I do not per&s;wade you to ca&s;t away a comfortable life, but to change it for a better; I do not per&s;wade you to leave delights and plea&s;ures, but to change them for more noble, more rational, more &s;piri|tual, more durable delights: Come and get a real ta&s;te and reli&s;h of the &s;weet de|lights in communion with God, in the &s;en&s;e of his love, in a right applying of his pro|mi&s;es, in hoping for his Kingdom; and if you do not like them better, and find them

<P N="4">4. It is better to be a poor man, and to be a free-man than to be a rich man under clo&s;e re&s;traint and bondage.

Is it not better to be in a low condition while you live and be &s;aved when you die, than to be ungodly, though rich in this world, and damned in the next?

It is to &s;inful man, and the &s;inful part of man that holy duties are &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing and &s;o burden&s;ome; it is becau&s;e your Souls are di&s;tempered, and not from any thing in the nature of holine&s;s; this is plain becau&s;e the Angels of God, that are without &s;in, do not find it a burden but a plea&s;ure to be o|bedient unto God; and when the people of God &s;hall be perfectly cured of all Soul-di&s;ea&s;es, they &s;hall not find any difficulty or tedious irk&s;omene&s;s in con&s;tant and perpe|tual holy actings; and man as made at fir&s;t by God, did take plea&s;ure, and did find great delight in his conformity to the will of God. It is plainly then from the corruption of your depraved nature, and the wicked|ne&s;s of your own hearts, that you find this difficulty in Religion and that holine&s;s is &s;uch a burden to you; as a man that is di|&s;tempered doth not &s;avour and reli&s;h his food: what others ta&s;te &s;weetne&s;s in, is bitter unto him, the cau&s;e is not in the meat, but in the palate; &s;hould this man cry out, my meat is bitter or rather my di&s;ea&s;e is great and dangerous; or &s;hould he therefore re|fu&s;e his &s;u&s;tenance, and rather die with hun|ger than receive his food? So &s;hould you cry out and complain, Godline&s;s is burden|&s;ome, and Religion is a tedious ta&s;k? or ra|ther blame the corruption of your heart

<P N="2">2. It is the external part of duties with|out the enjoyment of God in them, that makes them to be &s;o heavy and &s;o burden|&s;ome unto you; becau&s;e you do not get in|to the &s;piritual part of religious part of reli|gious performances. To pray indeed and not to meet with God in prayer, to fit and hear, to fa&s;t and afflict the body without communion with God, this is that which is the cau&s;e of this tediou&s;ne&s;s in Religion you do &s;o much cry out again&s;t; but in the in|ternal part of Religion, in loving of God, in believing on Chri&s;t, in meeting with God, in the de&s;ires of the Soul after God there is &s;weetne&s;s, and when it is thus with the Soul, it finds not duty to be a burden; but there the Soul could dwell, there it could with plea&s;ure &s;tay and make its a|bode. Nay there is more true delight in denying the plea&s;ures of the fle&s;h, than in fulfilling of them. The&s;e things you have no experience of, but a&s;k God's people, and they will tell you, this is &s;o; enquire of them and they will a&s;&s;ure you this is &s;o; and &s;hould you be thus prejudiced again&s;t what you do not know?

your prejudice would quickly be removed.

<P N="2">2. Set the nece&s;&s;ity of being found in the ways of God again&s;t the difficulty of walk|ing in them.

poor captives lo&s;e their &s;ouls and hopes to|gether; and thus with hopes of Heaven, they do go down to Hell, and then and there they can hope no longer. Its one of the harde&s;t things that Mini&s;ters have to do, to beat down the&s;e fal&s;e hopes of Heaven in our Hearers; if this were done, a great part of our work were done, if we tell you of your mi&s;ery and danger, of the wrath of God again&s;t &s;inners, of the torments that are prepared by a provoked God for you, yet you hope you &s;hall e&s;cape, and ward off all the threatnings of the Word with the&s;e vain and groundle&s;s hopes: if we could but get the&s;e fal&s;e hopes from you, then we &s;hould begin to hope that you might be delivered from your bondage, and e&s;cape this captivity, in which you are &s;o &s;trongly held thereby; no man is fa&s;ter bound in fetters, than he that is ungodly, and yet &s;trongly and confidently hopes that he &s;hall be &s;aved. If you could &s;peak with damned Souls, thou&s;ands of them would tell you, this was their ruin and their bane; &s;hould you a&s;k them were not you told, that &s;in would bring you to this place of torment? were you not told by Mini&s;ters and by God him&s;elf, that you were in the way to mi&s;ery and damnation? what would they reply? <Q>Yes, yes, we were often

<P N="1">1. One Link in this Chain of fal&s;e hopes by which the&s;e Captives are bound, is mi&s;|apprehen&s;ion and mi&s;application of the mercy of God; thou &s;aye&s;t, God is a merciful God, and is ready to &s;hew mercy to his creature; it is true in me, there is no merit, but in God there is mercy, and God did not make his creatures to damn them, God did make me, and therefore I hope that he will &s;ave me. Is this all thou ha&s;t to &s;ay in &s;uch a weighty matter? why thou thinke&s;t thou art redeemed from thy bondage, and &s;halt be free for ever from the torments of the Damned? that thou may&s;t be no longer bound with this Chain. Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Devils them&s;elves and the dam|ned &s;ouls in Hell them&s;elves can &s;ay as much as this: Poor damned Devils do know that God is a merciful God, and that he is wil|ling to &s;hew mercy to the penitent and the humble &s;inner. Devils and damned Souls can &s;ay, that they are God's creatures, and yet notwith&s;tanding, they are mi&s;erable, and mu&s;t be &s;o for ever; and this is the ag|gravation of their mi&s;ery, that though God is merciful, yet they are for ever damned; this cuts them to the heart, that a merciful

God condemned them, and &s;entenced them down to eternal torments; what is that to them, that God is merciful in him&s;elf, and &s;hews mercy unto others, if he is not merciful unto them? and what is it unto thee, that God is &s;o, if thou by rea&s;on of the continuance in a &s;tate of unregeneracy, &s;halt not be benefited by his mercy? I know <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is a difference betwixt the dam|ned in Hell, and wicked men on Earth? the damned in Hell are pa&s;t a po&s;&s;ibility of mercy, but &s;o are not you; they &s;hall have no more tenders of mercy, which you yet have, but then you mu&s;t repent and be con|verted, which they were not, or el&s;e you you &s;hall have no &s;aving benefit by God's mercy, as they had not.</P>
<P N="2">2. God might be infinite in mercy, though thou (and thou&s;ands &s;uch as thou art) do peri&s;h in thy bondage, and be for ever damned. What a proud bla&s;phemous tho't is this that God &s;hould not be merciful, except he take thee reaking in thy &s;ins, ex|cept he take thee off thy Ale-Hou&s;e-Bench, and put thee into Heaven. The greatne&s;s of God's mercy is not manife&s;ted &s;o much by the number of the per&s;ons that &s;hall be &s;aved, as by the way and method which he &s;aveth them by. If God had &s;aved but one man out of all the many millions of man|kind, without his own de&s;ert, and contrary
<PB N="92" REF="004934_0047_100E334A571ADF08">
to it, by the death of his own Son, it would have been a plain demon&s;tration of the mer|cy of God. Mu&s;t thou mea&s;ure the mercy of God by thy being &s;aved, or not &s;aved, while thou walke&s;t contrary to his Laws, and to his revealed Will? This is, as if a <HI>Malefactor</HI> that for murder hath de&s;er|ved death, and is to be tried for his Life, yet hopes he &s;hall e&s;cape, becau&s;e the Judge is a merciful man, when notwith|&s;tanding the Judge proceedeth to pa&s;s a &s;entence of death upon him, you will all acknowledge he might be a very merciful man; and that the Pri&s;oner was a fool, from the mercy of the Judge to be confi|dent he &s;hould e&s;cape the execution due unto him for the violation of the Law. So it is in this ca&s;e, which is ea&s;ie&s;t to apply.</P>
<P N="3">3. God is ju&s;t and true, as well as merci|ful and gracious, &amp; why may&s;t thou not fear that God will damn thee, becau&s;e he as a ju&s;t God, as well as hope that he will &s;ave thee becau&s;e he is a merciful God? You do not conceive of God aright, when you con&s;ider him to be merciful without ju&s;|tice, and to be gracious without truth, there are both in God. This merciful God hath &s;aid, Except you repent and turn from &s;in, you &s;hall find no mercy from him; and what &s;hall become of God's Truth, if con|trary

Where God proclaims his mercy to the penitent, he doth al&s;o de|clare his ju&s;tice, and his jealou&s;ie, and his fixed re&s;olution that the guilty &s;hall not go free. <HI>Ex.</HI> 34.6, 7. and that he is full of fury to the wicked, as of mercy to the godly; and that as he re&s;erveth a Crown for the one, &s;o al&s;o wrath for the other, <HI>Nahum</HI> 1.2, 3.</P>
<P N="4">4. Though God be merciful, yet he pro|poundeth conditions in the Go&s;pel, which you mu&s;t come up unto, if you will be par|takers of his mercy: And God is re&s;olved that if thou wilt not have mercy upon the terms of mercy thou &s;halt never have it. When thou &s;halt come to put in thy claim for mercy, Lord have mercy on me, for thou art a gracious God; yes may God &s;ay, and &s;o I am, and tho&s;e that have repented and believed &s;hall find me to be &s;o, but did I not al&s;o tell thee what manner of per&s;on thou &s;hould&s;t have been, holy, humble and re|penting, if thou would&s;t be &s;aved by my mercy, but that thou would&s;t not be: therefore now I have no mercy for thee.

<P N="5">5. Whereas thou &s;aye&s;t, God did make thee, therefore he will &s;ave thee, con&s;ider, the vile&s;t &s;inner in the world upon this ac|count &s;hould go to Heaven, yea, every one of them. The Whoremonger whom thou thy &s;elf wilt condemn might plead this as well as thou; and &s;o thou wilt make the way to Heaven broader than ever God did make it. Moreover if thou had&s;t continued &s;uch a one as God did make, he would then have made thee happy indeed for ever. God made thee holy and upright, but thou ha&s;t rebelled again&s;t him: God did make thee a Creature, but he did not make thee a Drunkard; he did not make thee a

<P N="2">2. Another Link in this Chain of fal&s;e hopes whereby Captives are bound is a &s;trong (though fal&s;e) per&s;wa&s;ion of &s;alvati|on by the death of Chri&s;t the Redeemer. If you a&s;k many carnal, ignorant and ungodly per&s;ons why they per&s;wade them|&s;elves that they &s;hall be &s;aved, they will tell you, becau&s;e "Chri&s;t died for &s;inners, and I am a &s;inner (&s;aith one) God help me, as

<P>By way of Conce&s;&s;ion it is granted, (1) that "the dea of Chri&s;t, and the Satis|faction made to the ju&s;tice of God thereby is the only meirtorious cau&s;e of mans redemp|tion from his bondage and of Salvation," and who&s;oever is &s;aved, is &s;aved by Chri&s;t's death, for there is no other Saviour nor Re|deemer be&s;ides him, <HI>Act.</HI> 4.12. and if Chri&s;t had not died, we had certainly been for ever captives without redemption. (2) It is true that this Redeemer is offered unto all where the Go&s;pel is preached, none are excluded from the offers of grace and par|don, and benefits of Redemption, and his death &s;hall be &s;ufficient and effectual for de|liverance from bondage, and making of them free that do obey his call, and accept of him for Lord Redeemer, as offered in the Go&s;pel, <HI>Act.</HI> 10.43. <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. But

yet that you might not through your own mi&s;take be the more enthralled by the means of Redemption, and be the fa&s;ter bound by the mi&s;under&s;tanding of the way of Salva|tion by the death of Chri&s;t. Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1.

I know (as I have &s;aid) that there is a differ|ence betwixt the &s;tate of Devils and dam|ned Souls, and of &s;inners upon earth, Chri&s;t is preached to the one, and not to the other, freedom from bondage is po&s;&s;ible to the one but not to the other, mercy doth entreat, and the Spirit doth &s;trive, and patience doth wait upon the one, but not upon the other; mercy and patience hath done with them for ever; no more a&s;king them, what? will you have Chri&s;t now? and will you be pardoned now? which yet thro' mercy is not your condition; but yet as to the ground of your plea for Redemption and Salvation by Chri&s;t, (before alledged) [Chri&s;t died for &s;inners and you are &s;inners]

<PB N="109" REF="004934_0055_100E3361CB4905D8">
that of a captive thou art made free.

<P N="2">2. But can your meaning be good, in many of your wicked acts, and in your &s;in|ful neglects? What good meaning is it in thee, to keep Chri&s;t out of thy heart? to prophane God's Sabbaths?

<P N="3">3. If thy meaning were good, this doth not make thy action good, nor thy life good; and can it then prove thy condition to be good?</P>
<P N="4">4. If thy heart were good, thy life would be &s;o too.

<P N="5">5. Whereas thou &s;aye&s;t, Thou ha&s;t good things in thy heart, though thou can&s;t not expre&s;s them with thy tongue. What is thy heart &s;o full of good? and is it &s;o locked up there, that there is no vent for it? What! neither by works nor words? neither by lip nor life? A likely matter! If thou art pinched with hunger, thou ha&s;t words enough to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e of thy wants, and if thou art &s;ick, thou ha&s;t words enough to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e of thy pain: When the Phy&s;ician comes and a&s;keth after the &s;tate of thy body, thou can&s;t quickly reply, O &s;ick, &s;ick, Sir I am exceeding &s;ick; I am in pain, in pain Where? O here in this part, and in this; my back, my bowels, my head, my heart, is full of pain. But if a Mini&s;ter come and enquire into your &s;pi|ritual &s;tate, you reply, Truly Sir, I have good things in my mind and in my heart, but I cannot expre&s;s them to you. What! not at all?

you want no words, there your tongues go glib: Who have words at command more than you? You can talk roundly of the World, of your Goods, and your E&s;tates, of your Furniture and Apparel; but in the things of God you are mute. This is plain, it is not for want of words in the&s;e, but for want of a work of God upon their hearts. Therefore let not the Devil keep thee any longer bound with this chain, a vain con|ceit of the goodne&s;s of thy heart, thy wi&s;h|ings and thy meanings.</P>
<P N="6">6.

But to|wards the cutting of this chain, con&s;ider,</P>
<P>There might be notional knowledge of the things of God, where a man never had any experimental ta&s;te and reli&s;h of them. A man that never yet repented, might be able to tell you what Repentance is; and a man that is not converted, might tell you

much of the Method of the Spirit in con|verting of a &s;inner. Many can talk of God, that never ta&s;ted any &s;weetne&s;s in him; and many can di&s;cour&s;e of Heaven, that &s;hall never enter into Heaven. The Head might be full of knowlege, when the heart is empty of Grace; might talk of faith, of the nature of it, of the actings of it, of the excellency of it, of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity and effects of it, and yet have no Faith; and &s;o of Love, and other graces, and yet have no Love, nor any other grace. The greater is your knowledge, the greater is your &s;in, and the greater will be your mi&s;ery if it be &s;eparated from practice and obedience, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.47, 48.</P>
<P>Thus you have heard what a &s;trong bond fal&s;e hope of Heaven is, and on what grounds it is built, and by what rea&s;ons it is &s;treng|thened, and how they are removed: What &s;ay you now? will you continue &s;till bound with this cord, and &s;till be kept thereby in your Captivity? I doubt yet many of you will. Drunkards, for all this hath been &s;aid, will hope for heaven and &s;alvation &s;till; and Swearers and Prophane per&s;ons will go on in their &s;inful cour&s;e, and yet hope &s;till for Heaven and Eternal life.

<P N="3">3. ANother Chain wherewith many of the&s;e Captives are bound is their &s;atisfying them&s;elves with a moral blamele&s;s life; faith one, I live peaceably among my neighbours; I defraud no man, I am ju&s;t in all my dealings; I give to every one their due; &s;aith another, I am no drunkard, no &s;wearer, no open profaner of Sabbaths, no man can lay any thing to my charge, nor &s;ay black is my eye. Many &s;inners re&s;t here, and do per&s;wade them&s;elves their con|dition is good and do not think that they are in bondage to the Devil, and &s;o do not look out after Redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Though all this be good in it &s;elf, yet it doth not argue that thy condition is good, becau&s;e it is not &s;ufficient to &s;alvation, for|a&s;much as God requireth this and &s;ome|thing more; nay, much more than this that thou may&s;t be meet for Heaven; to|wards the breaking of this bond, Con&s;ider,</P>

There are commands of God enjoyning you to repent, and believe, to pray and to for&s;ake &s;in; your not repenting, not believing will undo your &s;ouls; and there are commands enjoyning you to be no drunkards, to be no &s;wearers, not to de|fraud, nor over reach others in your dealings; now if you be no drunkards, yet if you are not believers you are &s;till in Satan's bonds: you mu&s;t not only not do evil, but you mu&s;t al&s;o do that which is good. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1.16.17. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.42.</P>

If thou art of an unblameable life, yet thou ha&s;t a corrupt and &s;inful heart; if thou, had&s;t been free all thy life long from every actual &s;in, (as thou art not) yet there is &s;in enough in thy heart to &s;ink thee to the lowe&s;t hell.

A moral man without converting, &s;ancti|fying grace, is like a Swine in a fair Meadow; that though it be not there wallowing in the mire yet it is a &s;wine &s;till.

<P N="7">7. Another Chain with which &s;ome Cap|tives are bound, is their re&s;ting in religious and holy duties; the&s;e go a &s;tep higher than the former, and yet are as fa&s;t bound as others be, and fa&s;ter too; for when many gro&s;s &s;inners are delivered from captivity, and their bonds are broke, Hypocrites are fa&s;t intangled with chains of their own making. Publicans and Harlots enter into the Kingdom of God, when Hypocrites are &s;hut out, <HI>Mat.</HI> 21.31 as Paul compared

Are they Mini|&s;ters of Chri&s;t?&mdash;I am more, in La|bours more abundant, in &s;tripes above mea&s;ure, in pri&s;ons more frequent, in deaths oft.</Q> So hypocrites comparing them|&s;elves with tho&s;e that are &s;et at liberty by Chri&s;t in re&s;pect of all external duties, and common gifts conceiting that therefore they are free too, are the fa&s;ter bound. Are God's free-men much in prayer? &s;o am I, &s;aith the Hypocrite. Are they frequent in hear|ing? &s;o am I. Are they admitted to all Ordinances, and received into Church-fel|low&s;hip by the godly, &s;trict, and careful Mi|ni&s;ters of Chri&s;t? &s;o am I. Do they talk and di&s;cour&s;e of God, and Chri&s;t, and Heaven? &s;o do I, and more than many of them do. Do they &s;uffer for Religion, and have been in bonds and pri&s;ons for Religi|ous wor&s;hipping of God? So have I.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;trong bonds, and the more they pray and hear, the &s;tronger are their bonds, while they are praying and hearing, the Devil is binding the&s;e captive-hypo|crites &s;o much the fa&s;ter, and this is their mi&s;ery more e&s;pecially, that the&s;e Chains which are made for their clo&s;e impri&s;on|ment,
<PB N="143" REF="004934_0072_100E3394ECB20440">
they do look upon as chains of or|nament and do glory in them. For the breaking of this Bond, Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. The external performance of Reli|gious Duties hath been done by many now in Hell, &s;ome of the now damned &s;ouls when in their bodies, were often pre&s;ent at Sermons as well as you, and often on their knees as well as you; and yet were then in the bonds of &s;in, and you al&s;o yet may be, and are now in chains in utter dark|ne&s;s, which God in mercy grant you may never be. Outward duties may be done to God, when there is inward prevailing love to &s;elf, to &s;in, and to the world; it is not &s;o much the matter as the manner of your duties, that argues your freedom from cap|tivity, not what you do, as for what end you do them, that doth di&s;tingui&s;h the Devil's captives from the Lord's free-men, Chri&s;t plainly tells you, that not every one that makes a profe&s;&s;ion of Religion &s;hall be delivered from the pri&s;on of Hell, <HI>Mat.</HI> 21.22, 23. and that the Children of the Kingdom &s;hall be ca&s;t into outer darkne&s;s, <HI>Mat.</HI> 8.12. Know therefore though you &s;hould hear ten thou&s;and Sermons, and make as many prayers, yet without an in|ward real change by converting grace upon your hearts, except you love God above all,
<PB N="144" REF="004934_0073_100E33968A552C10">
and chu&s;e and prize Chri&s;t before all, that you may not be relea&s;ed from captivity for the pre&s;ent, nor &s;aved hereafter.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is no certain judgment can be made of your &s;piritual &s;lavery or freedom by the thoughts that others have of you. Men judge charitably, but God judgeth certainly. Men judge of your hearts by your actions, but God judgeth of your Actions by your hearts; you might be admitted among the pure&s;t Congregation and yet not admitted into Heaven. If Chri&s;t him&s;elf were upon the earth thou mighte&s;t be an hearer of Chri&s;t, and yet a captive to the Devil. Chri&s;t tells you as much, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.26, 27, 28. And I pray you, what is it to be ap|plauded or approved by men, and to be con|demned by God? You are not to &s;tand or fall, to be damned or &s;aved by what men think of you, but by what God knows of you. Remember <HI>Judas,</HI> that carried him&s;elf &s;o among&s;t others, that the re&s;t of the di&s;ciples did rather &s;u&s;pect them&s;elves than him, &s;aying, Lord is it I? and another, Is it I, when Chri&s;t told them, one of them &s;hould betray him. Remember him and beware, that as others are bound cap|tives with the bonds of open and vi&s;ible ini|quity, that you remain not bound with the bonds of hidden and &s;ecret Hypocri&s;ie.</P>

Many of the &s;ame age make the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, and yet &s;ome are good, and &s;ome are bad, &s;ome are made free, and &s;ome continue captives: as the five fooli&s;h Virgins made the &s;ame pro|fe&s;&s;ion as the wi&s;e, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.1 to 13. and <HI>Judas,</HI> as the re&s;t of the Di&s;ciples; and yet the one was captivated, while the others were Redeemed; and &s;o it may be with per&s;ons that live and profe&s;s in &s;everal ages.</P>

<P N="1">1.

Wilt thou think of this, It is thy Soul that is a Captive, and in bonds?</P>
<P N="2">2. This captivity and bondage to Satan and to Sin, is wor&s;e than any other, in that the&s;e Captives are not &s;en&s;ible of their thraldom; do not lament them&s;elves, nor bewail their own condition, though it be &s;o bad, &s;o very bad. The children of I&s;rael did groan and &s;igh by rea&s;on of their bon|dage, <HI>Exod.</HI> 2.22. When <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> was bound with fetters, and carried captive to <HI>Babylon,</HI> he was &s;en&s;ible of the fetters on his body, that had before no &s;en&s;e of the bonds of &s;in, with which he was held in bondage by the Devil. And how do poor Captives &s;igh and groan under Turki&s;h
<PB N="160" REF="004934_0081_100E33B083C082A0">
&s;lavery, and bitterly lament becau&s;e of the hard u&s;age they are under? And how do many Pri&s;oners grieve and take on that they ever did that fact for which they are in Irons? Do men need to &s;pend many hours, and make many long Orations, to con|vince a Captive among&s;t the Turks of the &s;adne&s;s of his condition there? But how many hours mu&s;t a Mini&s;ter &s;pend in &s;tudy|ing and in preaching, before the&s;e Captives can be brought to a &s;en&s;e of their own woful and mi&s;erable condition? Before he can con|vince that indeed they are in this captivity? It is indeed but here and there one among&s;t a multitude that do &s;ee it, believe it, and bewail it. Who is witne&s;s of your groans, and of your tears? When did you complain to God or man of the fetters and the bonds of &s;in that have been &s;o long upon your &s;ouls? When did&s;t thou retire to thy Clo&s;et, and there lament thy woful ca&s;e? Is not this a dreadful ca&s;e to be near to Hell, and not to &s;ee it? to be near to dam|nation, and not to fear it? to be led by the Devil in the chains of &s;in, to a place of torment, and to be not at all &s;en&s;ible whi|ther you are going? Shall nothing but the flames of Hell convince thee of thy bon|dage? Wilt thou not believe the Devil is leading thee to Hell, till thou &s;ee&s;t, and
<PB N="161" REF="004934_0081_100E33B083C082A0">
finde&s;t, and feele&s;t, that thou art there? Wilt thou not yield that thou art of the number of Satan's Captives upon earth, till he brings thee to the Lake of burning Brim|&s;tone, and look round about thee, and then to thy eternal &s;orrow &s;ee, that thou art one of the number of the captivated &s;ouls in Hell? This makes thy captivity the &s;orer, and thy bonds the &s;tronger, that thou art not &s;en&s;ible of thy bondage.</P>
<P N="3">3. So doth this too, that thou art a vo|luntary bond &s;lave to Satan and to Sin; thou art the Devil's &s;ervant, and art willing to be &s;o; in bondage, and art willing to e-main therein; thou mighte&s;t have liberty, but thou wilt not. Thou art like the &s;er|vant that plainly &s;aid, I love my Ma&s;ter, I will not go out free; and would rather have his ears bored through with an Awl, and &s;erve him for ever, than be made free, <HI>Exod.</HI> 21.5, 6. Slaves in <HI>Turkey</HI> are there again&s;t their wills, it is not matter of their choice; Captives they be, but they are not willing Captives; they do not love their fetters, nor their chains, nor the work and &s;ervice that they are put unto: but thou art in Captivity to Satan, and thou love&s;t to have it &s;o; thou drudge&s;t in his &s;ervice, and do&s;t love to do it; but what wilt thou do in the end thereof? <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.31. Others
<PB N="162" REF="004934_0082_100E33B3B107BE18">
are by power and force taken and continu|ed Captives, but thou do&s;t voluntarily yield thy&s;elf to be a &s;lave; for Satan could not have taken men captive, nor hold them therein, without their own con&s;ent. Like <HI>Ahab,</HI> thou do&s;t &s;ell thy &s;elf for a &s;lave, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 21.20. and what do&s;t thou &s;ell thy &s;elf, thy &s;oul, a captive for? For a little profit and for a little &s;hort and momentary plea&s;ure? That thou mighte&s;t gratify thy lu&s;ts for a while, and plea&s;e thy palate and thy fle&s;h for a while, thou art contented to be a &s;lave for ever. When a man is taken captive, yet his will is not taken; when his body is fettered, yet his will is not overcome; he hath a will to re&s;i&s;t &s;till, if he had but power; he hath a will to have off his chains, though he cannot; and a will to e&s;cape, and be &s;et at liberty, though there is none to lay down a ran&s;om for him: But the Devil's captives have no will to be deli|vered or freed from their bondage, though there be a ran&s;om paid, and the benefit of it be offered unto them.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is a plenary and full Captivity; all the Sinner is in bondage, not only the will, but all the powers and affections of the &s;oul; &s;o that there is nothing in him free. If a man be in bondage to men, his thoughts might be free, and his affections might be
<PB N="163" REF="004934_0082_100E33B3B107BE18">
free to love God, to delight in God, to de&s;ire after God. But &s;atan's captives have no freedom to any thing that is &s;piritually good and plea&s;ing unto God; therefore this is a &s;ore bondage.</P>
<P N="5">5. The&s;e captives are Children of the Wrath of God; whereas others that are Captives to men, might be Children of the Love of God; as they love and delight in God when they be in chains, &s;o God may love and delight in them. If a man's out|ward condition be never &s;o bad, yet he might comfort him&s;elf with the thoughts of God's love to him; though I be in pri&s;on, yet God loves me; and though I be in chains, yet God loves me: But the Devil's Cap|tives do not love God, nor are beloved by him. A love of good-will God hath had to many of the&s;e Captives, a love of Purpo&s;e to do them good in delivering them from their bonds; but a love of complacency and delight, &s;o that God &s;hould take plea&s;ure in you while you are voluntarily and totally the Devil's Slaves and Servants, there is not in God towards you. O did you but know the Wrath of God, the Fury of the Lord, what it is, how great, how intolerable; Could you plea&s;e your &s;elves in that condi|tion in which you are the objects of his
<PB N="164" REF="004934_0083_100E33B6C2726760">
wrath? As there is no love like to the love of God; &s;o there is no wrath like to the wrath of God; therefore that Condition (be it what it will) is not &s;o bad in which you may be the object of God's love, as that condition is in which you are and mu&s;t be the objects of his wrath.</P>
<P N="6">6. Death doth not deliver Satan's Captives from their thraldom and their bondage, but doth &s;traiten their Bonds, and &s;trengthen their chains and puts them into an impo&s;&s;i|bility of Redemption for ever. If a &s;lave be no way delivered while he liveth, yet he is freed when he dies; death will bring him a relea&s;e, and give him a di&s;charge; <HI>Job</HI> 3.17, 18, 19. <Q>There the wicked cea&s;e from troubling; and there the weary be at re&s;t. There the pri&s;oners re&s;t toge|ther, they hear not the voice of the op|pre&s;&s;or. The &s;mall and great are there, and the &s;ervant is free from his ma&s;ter.</Q> When the King of Babylon had taken <HI>Ze|dikiah</HI> captive, and bound him in fetters, he put him in pri&s;on till the day of his death, and then he was his pri&s;oner no longer, <HI>Jer.</HI> 52.12. But the&s;e are Captives till they die, and which is wor&s;e, are Captives after death. The others might &s;ay, and comfort them|&s;elves therewith.

<P N="7">7. A wor&s;e and more dreadful Pri&s;on is prepared for the Devil's Captives, than any &s;laves on earth can be ca&s;t into. Hell is the Pri&s;on appointed and prepared for all Captives that are not made free by Chri&s;t, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.19. Several things makes this Pri|&s;on wor&s;e than any other.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Pri&s;on prepared for the&s;e Captives is a clo&s;e Pri&s;on. Now you are like to Pri|&s;oners that &s;ometimes might walk abroad with their Keeper with them. Now thou art a Pri&s;oner at large, that walke&s;t up and down, thou in thy chains of &s;in and guilt, and the Devil thy Keeper doth attend and watch thee whither&s;oever thou goe&s;t; if thou come&s;t to a Sermon, thy Keeper com|eth with thee, to prevent thy breaking loo&s;e, and when thou goe&s;t from the Sermon, to tempt thee to return to thy cour&s;e of &s;in a|gain. But hereafter thou &s;halt be a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner, not &s;uffered to &s;tep out for ever; and &s;o clo&s;e &s;halt thou be kept that none
<PB N="166" REF="004934_0084_100E33B9A29349B0">
&s;hall come at thee, to vi&s;it or to comfort thee. It is an alleviation of a Pri&s;oner's grief, though he hath not liberty to go out and &s;ee his friends, yet his friends might come and &s;ee and vi&s;it him; but neither &s;hall be al|lowed unto you, when once you are clo&s;e pri&s;oners in hell. Thy friends on earth will not be de&s;irous of thy company, or thy vi&s;its after death, if thou had&s;t the liberty to come forth; &s;uch vi&s;its of damned Souls would be a burden, and di&s;quietment, and a terror to the living; that would then rather wi&s;h that thou wa&s;t confined to thy pri&s;on, than to be permitted to come forth to di&s;turb them by thy vi&s;its: Neither &s;hall any be &s;uffered to come and comfort thee, if they would; and indeed, none would be de&s;irous, nor venture &s;o far as to come to hell to comfort thee, if they might. Though the rich man de&s;ired that <HI>Lazarus</HI> might come and comfort him with one drop of water, it would not be granted to him, for he was a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16.24, 25. Be&s;ides, there is a great gulf fixed between them and the Saints above, that there is no pa&s;&s;ing from the one place to the other, <HI>ver.</HI> 26.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a dark pri&s;on, a very dungeon, a place of utter darkne&s;s, a place where there is thickne&s;s and blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s forever, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.30. <HI>Jude v.</HI> 13. Darkne&s;s add|eth
<PB N="167" REF="004934_0084_100E33B9A29349B0">
to the di&s;comfort of the condition they mu&s;t be in, in that Pri&s;on forever. It was an amazing Judgment on the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> to be under thick darkne&s;s for three days, <HI>Exod.</HI> 10.22, 23. What a dreadful dungeon would this world be without the light of Sun, or Moon, or Stars, or Candle, though you were not in pain, nor want of other outward enjoyments, yet it would be no de|&s;irable place to continue in. Oh then, what will be the &s;adne&s;s, frights, and fears of the&s;e captives for ever, that &s;hall be in pain, in torment, and in darkne&s;s forever. If a man were to live all his days in a Palace, there to have rich Provi&s;ions to feed upon, and beds of down to lodge upon, but yet to be always in the dark, would be a great affliction to him: Oh then, what will it be to live in pain and darkne&s;s too? to lie and roul &amp; tumble in a bed of flames, in a lake of Brim&s;tone, and in darkne&s;s too? to be among&s;t Devils, and this in darkne&s;s too? and mu&s;t not that be a place of darkne&s;s for ever, where the light of God's countenance &s;hall not &s;hine upon the pri&s;oners there forever?</P>
<P N="3">3. It is a filthy Pri&s;on, full of noi&s;om &s;tenches, and un&s;avoury &s;mells; pri&s;ons are filthy places, very offen&s;ive to the no&s;trils, but the &s;tench of the Brim&s;tone &s;hall be more trouble&s;ome to the pri&s;oners there than
<PB N="168" REF="004934_0085_100E33BCD8FEB268">
the mo&s;t &s;tinking dungeon to any upon earth.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is a &s;trong pri&s;on; As it is &s;o clo&s;e that none can come to them to comfort them, &s;o it is &s;o &s;trong that not a pri&s;oner &s;hall e&s;cape, or break through, or get out to all eternity; if once the&s;e pri&s;on-doors be &s;hut, and if Chri&s;t that hath the keys of death and hell, do once put thee in, and turn the key upon thee, there is no opening them for ever. Now you are bound in chains of your own making, even of your &s;ins; but hereafter you &s;hall be bound in chains of God's making. And there are four Bars or Bolts upon the pri&s;on-gates of hell, that the pri&s;oners &s;hall be filled with de&s;pair of ever coming forth.</P>
<P N="1">1. This pri&s;on-gates &s;hall be made forever fa&s;t and &s;trong by the coun&s;el and decrees of God; God hath ordained, that the im|pri&s;onment of tho&s;e captives that die before they are made free, &s;hall be eternal; it is the unalterable will of God, that they &s;hall lie in chains for ever; God's purpo&s;e mu&s;t be changed before their chains can be broken or the pri&s;oners delivered: But God is a God that doth not change, he will be al|ways the &s;ame for ever; therefore the pri|&s;oners mu&s;t abide by it for ever.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="169" REF="004934_0085_100E33BCD8FEB268">2. This pri&s;on-gates &s;hall be made fa&s;t and &s;trong by the ju&s;tice of God. Ju&s;tice &s;hall keep the pri&s;on-door, that not a pri&s;o|ner &s;hall come forth till he hath made &s;atis|faction for his &s;in, till he hath paid his debts to the uttermo&s;t farthing, and that will ne|ver be. When the pri&s;oner hath been there a thou&s;and years, and &s;hould beg, and pray, 'Lord, I have been here a thou&s;and years, it is a long time, a long time, O methinks it is a long time &s;ince the day I came into this place; my time of &s;inning &s;eemed &s;hort, it was indeed but &s;hort; but my time of &s;uffering &s;eemeth long; now therefore Lord let me come forth.' No, &s;aith Ju&s;|tice, yet I am not &s;atisfied. And when the other thou&s;and years be pa&s;t, and the pri|&s;oner &s;hould again petition for his liberty, the &s;ame an&s;wer will be returned; No, &s;aith Ju&s;tice, for yet I am not &s;atisfied, and till that be done, thou mu&s;t abide in pri&s;on. Mu&s;t I Lord? then there is no hope.</P>
<P N="3">3. This pri&s;on-gates &s;hall be made fa&s;t upon the pri&s;oners by the Truth of God. God hath told you in his Word, that this fire burns for ever, and that the &s;inner that is not &s;anctified &s;hall be ca&s;t into it, to lodge there for ever. The truth of God is is e|ternal truth; and &s;o long as the Word of
<PB N="170" REF="004934_0086_100E33BEB622BBF0">
God abideth true, &s;o long &s;hall the&s;e Cap|tives continue in this pri&s;on.</P>
<P N="4">4. This pri&s;on-gates &s;hall be made fa&s;t and &s;trong by the power of God. There &s;hall be no getting out by force, nor by any oppo&s;ition that they can make; the &s;ame power that &s;ent them thither, &s;hall keep them that they &s;hall neither die in this pri|&s;on, nor e&s;cape out of it. If then the gates of this pri&s;on be fa&s;tened by the unchangea|ble Decree of God, by the Ju&s;tice, Truth, and Power of God, the pri&s;oners might &s;et their hearts at re&s;t, or rather &s;hall never be at re&s;t, becau&s;e they never &s;hall come forth from pri&s;on.</P>
<P N="5">5. This pri&s;on is far wor&s;e than any o|ther pri&s;on, becau&s;e of the company that is there; and yet in many pri&s;ons there is a very wicked crew of &s;wearing, cur&s;ing, and cur&s;ed company; if a godly man were in &s;ome pri&s;ons among&s;t &s;uch company, the company would be a greater affliction to him, than the pri&s;on. But if the company of Devils, and Souls hating and bla&s;pheming God, be wicked company, this &s;hall be found in hell, all bad, not one good among&s;t the millions that are there; as in heaven, all good, not one bad among&s;t the thou&s;ands that are there. Here the&s;e captives &s;in to|gether, and they &s;hall be in pri&s;on all toge|ther,

one cur&s;ing and crying out again&s;t an|other, that ever they were on earth acquain|ted with them. Nay, then the Devil and his Slaves &s;hall be in pri&s;on together, the conqueror and the conquered both ca&s;t into the Lake of Brim&s;tone, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.41.</P>
<P N="6">6. The remembrance of the facts for which the&s;e captives &s;hall be ca&s;t into this pri&s;on, will make it wor&s;e than any other. To remember, here we are for obeying the Devil rather than God, for hearkening to the temptations of the Devil, when we &s;top|ped our ears again&s;t all the cries, and calls, and coun&s;els of God; had we but heark|ned to the voice of mercy, to the entreaties of Chri&s;t, or to the exhortations of his Mi|ni&s;ters, we had now been free from this tor|ment and this pain. Had we &s;erved God as diligently, daily, and faithfully as we &s;er|ved the Devil, we had been now in a better place, and we &s;hould now have had a better reward. Oh, What are we damned for our plea&s;ing of our fle&s;h to the di&s;plea&s;ing of God! Do we &s;uffer eternal pains for our folly, in preferring the &s;hort plea&s;ures and profits of the world before God, the greate&s;t and the chiefe&s;t good; for my plea&s;ing of my palate! This is the fruit of my drinking bouts! The wine in the gla&s;s was not &s;o &s;weet, as the wrath of God in this cup is
<PB N="172" REF="004934_0087_100E33C4939FBA38">
bitter, which I have been a thou&s;and years a drinking off, but cannot drink it up. Oh better I had had &s;o much &s;calding lead pour|ed down my throat, than tho&s;e plea&s;ant cups for which I am now in greate&s;t pain. The thoughts of what they &s;hall be in pri&s;on for will make the pri&s;on the more unplea|&s;ant.</P>
<P N="7">7. The remembrance of a price and ran|&s;om that was given for captives, and the be|nefit thereof often tendered unto them, will make this pri&s;on more intolerable; There and then to remember, the Son of God came down from Heaven and did give him&s;elf, his blood, his &s;oul, to redeem &s;inners out of bondage, and this was tendered unto me, &s;aith one, and to me &s;aith another, but I like a cur&s;ed and unthankful wretch did &s;light it and refu&s;e it, &s;aith one; and I like a mi&s;erable Caitiff did prefer my &s;ins and lu&s;ts before the Redeemer, &s;aith another! we were often warned of this place, and often a&s;ked and intreated to accept of Chri&s;t, and deliverance by him; time was, that Mini|&s;ters in the Name of God did come unto us Sabbath after Sabbath, and in his name did offer liberty unto us; how often did they a&s;k us, to be willing to leave our bonds, how earne&s;tly did they beg that we would be but willing to have our fetters
<PB N="173" REF="004934_0087_100E33C4939FBA38">
knocked off, and if we had been but will|ing, it &s;hould have been done; but that time is pa&s;t, tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons are gone, and here we lie bound in fetters for ever. O time, time, whither art thou fled? Can it not be recalled, can it not be recalled? O no, no, it cannot be recalled: and tho&s;e offers never &s;hall be repeated, but to our greater aggravation, by the gnawing worm.</P>

<P><HI>Doct.</HI> 2. THE &s;econd general Head con|taining the glad tydings to the&s;e mi&s;erable Captives, is that there is Liberty to be had by Chri&s;t; or, that it is by Chri&s;t, and had by Chri&s;t alone that poor captive &s;inners are delivered and &s;et at liberty. Had it not been for Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t have peri&s;h|ed in our Bonds, and remained in perpetual &s;lavery while we had lived, and been for ever bound in chains of darkne&s;s, when we die. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 59.20. applied to Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.26. <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. <HI>John</HI> 8.36.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="004934_0088_100E33C7260667D0">Man might be con&s;idered in a four-fold State.</P>
<P N="1">1. In his fir&s;t condition as created by God: then man was a free-man, bondage came in by &s;in: when man &s;inned he lo&s;t his freedom. And in this e&s;tate there was a three-fold liberty that man had.</P>
<P N="1">1. Man was free from &s;in; not the lea&s;t &s;pot or &s;tain by creation in this pure nature of man; he was then free from pride, and free from the inordinate love of the world, and from every thing offen&s;ive &amp; di&s;plea&s;ing to God. <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 7.29. &mdash; God made man upright. The uprightne&s;s of a man renewed by &s;ancti|fying grace denotes the &s;incerity of his heart, though there be &s;in inherent in him. So <HI>Job</HI> was an upright man, <HI>Job</HI> 1.1. But the uprightne&s;s of man at fir&s;t created by God denoteth the perfect Image of God in the pre&s;ence of that which was good, and ab|&s;ence of all &s;in. <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.26, 27.</P>
<P N="2">2. Man had a freedom or liberty of will, to will and to do what God did require from him.</P>
<P N="3">3. A freedom from all mi&s;ery, calamity and puni&s;hments. Man had then a freedom from &s;ickne&s;s, from &s;orrow and from afflic|tion and death; for all the&s;e are the fruits of &s;in: Man had never been in bondage to the&s;e; if he had not become a bond&s;lave to
<PB N="175" REF="004934_0088_100E33C7260667D0">
Satan and to &s;in. And in this &s;tate man had no need of a Redeemer, becau&s;e he was not then a captive.</P>
<P N="2">2. Man might be con&s;idered in a &s;tate of Corruption, and &s;o his condition is quite con|trary to what it was in his fir&s;t e&s;tate; as before he was free, &s;o now he is a &s;lave, be|fore at liberty, but now in bondage; and this bondage is oppo&s;ite to the former three fold Liberty.</P>
<P N="1">1. In man there is now a bondage to &s;in, in &s;lavery to his own lu&s;ts and to his own vile affections, that there is no part in him free from &s;in; his under&s;tanding is not free from ignorance, darkne&s;s and error, his will is not free from ob&s;tinacy and rebellion, his affections are not free from di&s;order and con|fu&s;ion, hating what he &s;hould love, and lo|ving what he &s;hould hate, &s;hunning what he &s;hould de&s;ire, and de&s;iring what he &s;hould &s;hun, rejoicing in that which &s;hould be the matter, cau&s;e and rea&s;on of his &s;orrow, and grief, and grieving and being weary of that which &s;hould be the matter of his delight and joy. This is man's &s;inful bondage.</P>
<P N="2">2. The very will of man is inthralled. That though man hath a liberty of will as to natural actions and to civil actions, and to outward and &s;piritual actions, he can come and hear if he will, he can &s;et upon the out|ward
<PB N="176" REF="004934_0089_100E33CA4F07BB88">
duty of prayer if he will: he can read the Word of God, if he will, yet he hath no liberty of will to &s;upernatural actions without the grace of God as to believe on Chri&s;t, to love God above all; man mu&s;t have a will as well as a power from God to do the&s;e things. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.13. <Q>It is God that giveth us to will and to do of his own good plea&s;ure.</Q> And this is a &s;ore bondage, tho' a natural man feel it not, and is not &s;en&s;ible of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. In bondage by rea&s;on of puni&s;hment, being liable to all the cur&s;es, plagues and puni&s;hments threatned for &s;in in the Word of God, both in this life and that which is to come, to &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;orrows, to pain and griefs, to death at la&s;t, and to hell and damnation after death. And in this e&s;tate man doth need a Redeemer, and a Ran|&s;om, and is utterly and eternally undone if he be not delivered from this bondage.</P>
<P N="3">3. Man might be con&s;idered in a &s;tate of grace as recovered by Chri&s;t, as renewed and re&s;tored by the Spirit of God; for God doth not &s;uffer all men to remain in their bondage, and tho&s;e that are redeemed and recovered mu&s;t not a&s;cribe this to their own free will but to the free grace of God. And in this e&s;tate Man is made partaker in part of the fruits of Redemption by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="177" REF="004934_0089_100E33CA4F07BB88">4. Man might be con&s;idered in a &s;tate of Glory. And there the Saints are all free, and altogether free, they have perfect liber|ty from &s;in, from &s;orrow, from temptations to &s;in, from all inclination to &s;in, from a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;inning: and in this e&s;tate the Saints of God do fully and eternally enjoy the fruits of Chri&s;t's Redemption, and of his giving of him&s;elf a ran&s;om for them.</P>
<P>Qu. 1. What it is that we have not a liberty from by Chri&s;t the Redeemer? There are many things that Chri&s;t did not come to purcha&s;e or proclaim liberty from while we are in this life.</P>
<P N="1">1. None of God's Elect are freed by Chri&s;t from being born in original &s;in; we are not born free, but are made free; even tho&s;e that are de&s;cended from free men in Chri&s;t, are by birth in &s;piritual bondage: for grace doth not come by blood, but by the will of God, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.13. No man &s;ince the Fall, except Chri&s;t the Redeemer hath been free from this &s;inful contagion that hath infected all mankind, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12.17, 18.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t doth not free us in this World from the indwelling of &s;in: Chri&s;t doth free all Believers from the reigning power of &s;in, Rom. 6.14. but not from the conflicting power of &s;in, no, nor altogether from the captivating power of &s;in; the Lord's free|men
<PB N="178" REF="004934_0090_100E33CD660903C8">
might &s;ometimes be overpowred with a temptation, and with a corruption, and in a particular combat be carried captive, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.23. nor doth Chri&s;t free us at all from the indwelling of &s;in. As God did not pre&s;ently free the people of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from the Nations that did vex them, nor drive them out at once, but by degrees, he left &s;ome of them to prove them and to humble them, <HI>Exod.</HI> 23.28, 29. &s;o all God's redeemed and free &s;ervants do &s;till experience the re|mainders of &s;in and corruption, and do com|plain thereof and cry out becau&s;e of it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.24. There are &s;till reliques of pride and unbelief, and hardne&s;s of heart. Thus we are not free from di&s;tracting thoughts in holy duties, nor from all dulne&s;s of affection, and deadne&s;s of heart in the &s;ervice of God. This <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;erved for the &s;tate of glorious free|dom in the life to come, when we &s;hall be and live in the immediate pre&s;ence of the ble&s;&s;ed God above, and &s;hall live in the be|holding of him immediately that hath re|deemed us from our Captivity and Bondage.</P>
<P N="3">3. Chri&s;t hath not freed us from the &s;er|vice of God, but rather doth engage us to it. Wicked men judge this to be liberty to live as they li&s;t, and to walk and act as they plea&s;e, in gratifying the lu&s;t and plea&s;ing of the fle&s;h. This is not liberty but licentiou&s;|ne&s;s;
<PB N="179" REF="004934_0090_100E33CD660903C8">
this indeed is the bondage that Chri&s;t came to deliver us from. Oh how is the blind world mi&s;taken, when they take their very bondage for their liberty! The &s;tricte&s;t Service of God is the greate&s;t Li|berty. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.45. It is not a liberty from duty, but from &s;in and mi&s;ery, that Chri&s;t came to purcha&s;e and proclaim, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.74, 75. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.16. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.18.

<P N="4">4. This &s;piritual freedom by Chri&s;t doth not exempt us nor excu&s;e us from the &s;er|vice we owe to men in the places and re|lations wherein God hath &s;et us. Indeed the Lord's free-men mu&s;t not be the &s;er|vants of men, &s;o as to plea&s;e men in that in which they will di&s;plea&s;e God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.23. but yet one that is the Lord's free-man might be in the place of a &s;ervant to man, and ought to follow his calling and mind his Ma&s;ters bu&s;ine&s;s, and that with greater care and con&s;cience than others do, even to &s;uch Ma&s;ters as be the &s;ervants of &s;in, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 6.5, 6. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.18. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.13.

<P N="5"><PB N="180" REF="004934_0091_100E33D1FB0B8E08">5. Chri&s;t doth not free us from afflictions nor from troubles from men. Chri&s;t hath no where told us, he came to free us from &s;corns and from reproaches; from pri&s;ons, and from tribulations; but the contrary, <HI>Joh.</HI> 16. la&s;t. All God's Freemen will be hated by the Devil's Slaves; and we &s;hall not be freed from them, till we be out of their reach, and that will not be till we get to Heaven. Tho&s;e that have &s;piritual li|berty might lo&s;e their civil liberty: as a man might have a civil liberty, but not &s;pi|ritual; a man might be free of a City, free of a Company, and yet not free by Chri&s;t: &s;o a man might be in pri&s;on, bound in chains there, and yet be &s;piritually free; <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in the pri&s;on, <HI>Daniel</HI> in the den, <HI>Jeremiah</HI> in the dungeon, and yet all the Lord's Free-men. When Chri&s;t calls to many in their bondage to come to him to be made free, they would indent with Chri&s;t that they &s;hould enjoy freedom from cro&s;&s;es and trou|bles, and &s;ufferings; which becau&s;e Chri&s;t doth not free his followers from, they had rather have their freedom from &s;ufferings in their bondage, than &s;ufferings with &s;piritual freedom.</P>
<P N="6">6. Chri&s;t doth not give us freedom from temptations of the Devil, that we &s;hould be no more buffetted by that wicked one.

Chri&s;t him&s;elf was not free from temptati|ons from Satan, nor from per&s;ecutions from men. Re&s;i&s;t the Devil, watch and pray a|gain&s;t his temptations, for you are not like to be freed from them, 'till you get to Heaven.</P>
<P N="7">7. Chri&s;t doth not free us from the &s;troke of death: the Lord's free-men mu&s;t be bound with death's bonds as well as others, Our &s;ouls and bodies are not free from di&s;&s;o|lution, your bodies are not free from putre|faction; but yet we are freed from the &s;ting of death; and death is not the &s;ame to the Lord's Free-men, as it is to the Devil's Bond-men.</P>
<P N="2">Q. 2. What is the liberty that we have by Chri&s;t? This &s;hall be managed in &s;peaking to the&s;e two particulars. Fir&s;t, As this liberty and freedom is privative. Secondly, As it is po&s;itive; or, what we are freed from; and what it is that we are freed to.</P>
<P N="1">1. What it is that believers are freed from by Chri&s;t; and the&s;e are great and &s;ore evils, and &s;uch as would have made us un&s;peakably and eternally mi&s;erable if Chri&s;t had not freed us from them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Chri&s;t hath delivered us, and &s;et us free from the power of Satan, that he hath no more rule in us as formerly he had; he
<PB N="182" REF="004934_0092_100E26BE58084090">
did rule in our hearts, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 2.2.

<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t hath &s;et us free from &s;in; not for the pre&s;ent, or in this life from the in|dwelling of &s;in, as you heard before; but in the&s;e two re&s;pects</P>
<P N="1">1. By Chri&s;t believers have a freedom from the guilt of &s;in. We are free from the obligation that lay upon us to eternal torments; &s;o that now we &s;hall ne|ver come into condemnation for our &s;ins; our many &s;ins are all pardoned, our great and heinous &s;ins are all forgiven, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1.33, 34. Many might accu&s;e, the Devil might accu&s;e, and Men might accu&s;e, and Con&s;cience might accu&s;e, and the Law might accu&s;e us; but Chri&s;t hath &s;o freed us, that none can condemn. O what a ble&s;&s;ed Piece of our freedom lieth in this! What would&s;t thou have done to have an&s;|wered for thy &s;ins? What would&s;t thou
<PB N="183" REF="004934_0092_100E26BE58084090">
have done to bear the puni&s;hment of thy &s;ins? Indeed thou could&s;t neither an&s;wer for thy &s;elf, nor yet have born the wrath of God due to thee for thy &s;in. Oh then &s;ee the everla&s;ting obligation laid upon thee to love this ble&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t, to prize, and value, and e&s;teem this once crucified &amp; now glo|rious Chri&s;t, that hath taken off this obliga|tion from thee; he hath freed thee from one obligation, and thereby laid upon thee another; he hath freed thee from an obli|gation to eternal condemnation, and hath laid down upon thee a &s;trong and la&s;ting o|bligation to love him, and to prai&s;e and ad|mire his love and grace to thee forever.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t hath &s;et us free from the domi|nion of &s;in. The Sinner was the Captive, and Sin the Lord and Conqueror; but he that is made free by Chri&s;t, is become the Conqueror, and Sin the Captive; the Vic|tory indeed is not yet compleated, yet &s;in is dethroned; the &s;inner when a captive was in chains; but now made free, &s;in is be|come bound. Sin was delighted in, but now it is abhorred; &s;in was voluntarily yielded unto, but now re&s;i&s;ted and oppo&s;ed; &s;in was welcomly entertained, but now la|mented and bewailed; it was looked upon with plea&s;ure and content, but now it is beheld with a &s;orrowful heart, and with a

Now &s;aith the re|deemed &s;inner, my hard heart is a burden to me; my proud and unbelieving heart is a burden and a grief unto me; my vain and worldly heart is a burden and a trouble, and a &s;orrow to me; he is freed from the reign|ing power of &s;in, Rom. 6.14.</P>
<P N="7">7. Chri&s;t hath &s;et believers free from the cur&s;e of the Law. The Law hath its u&s;e under the Go&s;pel; by it we come to the knowledge of &s;in, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.20, and 5.20 by it we are convinced of our mi&s;ery, that by &s;in we have de&s;erved death and damnation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.10. that we might &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t, and ha&s;ten the more to him. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.24. It &s;erveth for a rule to direct us in our walk|ing, and for a gla&s;s in which we &s;ee imper|fection of our duty and obedience, that we might not re&s;t in them, nor tru&s;t unto them for life and &s;alvation. But from the con|demning &s;entence and cur&s;e of the Law, Chri&s;t hath made believers free, by being made him&s;elf a cur&s;e for them, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10, 13.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="185" REF="004934_0093_100E33D7637368B0">4. Chri&s;t hath &s;et believers free from the hurt of death. The Lord's Free-men mu&s;t die as well as the Devil's Bond-men; but Death will be another thing to a Free-man, than it is unto a Captive: &s;o that which is formidable to a &s;inner, is de&s;irable to a Saint. Chri&s;t hath taken away the &s;ting of Death, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.55. of an Enemy is become a Friend; and Death, that is one of the plagues that befall the Devil's Captives, is become part of the Charter of the Lord's Free-men, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.22.</P>
<P N="1">1. Death to Free-men of the Lord is the utter abolition of their &s;in; it &s;hall free them from the very being and in-dwelling of &s;in: when the &s;oul &s;hall be &s;eperated from the body, all &s;in, and all corruption &s;hall be &s;eparated from the &s;oul: whereas the Devil's bond-men die in their &s;in, and after death do &s;till retain their hatred unto God, their enmity to Chri&s;t, and are more confirmed and hardened in it than before.</P>
<P N="2">2. Death to the Lord's Freemen puts an end to all their &s;orrow and affliction, to all their troubles and their &s;ufferings. It is God's Handkerchief, whereby he wipes away all tears from the eyes of his redeemed peo|ple, <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.13. but at death the &s;orrow of the Devil's Captives doth begin, or is en|crea&s;ed;

if they were at ea&s;e while they lived, they &s;hall be in pain when they die: if they did roar and &s;ing while they lived, they &s;hall roar and lament after death: Death takes them from their riches, from their friends, and from their plea&s;ure, and what&s;oever was dear unto them in this world's enjoyments, and puts them into a place of pain and torment, a place of utter darkne&s;s, where they &s;hall for ever weep and howl, and fruitle&s;ly lament their wo|ful &s;tate, and their irrecoverably-lo&s;t-hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. Death to the Lord's Free-men is the gate to glory, and their pa&s;&s;age and entrance into eternal life: It is the opening of the door to let them into their Father's hou&s;e; a Me&s;&s;enger &s;ent by God to fetch them in|to the pre&s;ence of their God and Redeem|er, to live, and reign, and dwell with him forever, that their freedom here begun might be con&s;ummated and perfected in heaven. In that very day they die, they are admitted as free Citizens of the glorious Kingdom of God, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16.22.</P>
<P N="4">4. Death to the Lord's Free-men &s;hall come in the be&s;t time. All men die in God's time, whenever he appointeth; but the redeemed by Chri&s;t &s;hall die in the be&s;t time, when their work is done, and when

Men cut down Weeds at any time, but the Corn in the be&s;t time, in the fitte&s;t &s;ea&s;on, when it is ripe to be carried into the barn.</P>
<P N="5">5. Death to the Lord's Freemen hath lo&s;t its terriblene&s;s. And though all God's redeemed are not actually and totally freed from the fears of death, but &s;ometimes kept in bondage through the fears of death; yet they have grounds and rea&s;ons why they might not fear it: But the Devil's Captives have always cau&s;e and rea&s;on to be terribly afraid of death; and if they be not, it ari&s;eth from the blindne&s;s of their minds, and the hardne&s;s of their hearts. "It is a wonder that men &s;hould be as near to hell

Death and the grave &s;hall not always have domi|nion over their body. Death doth bind them, but Chri&s;t will loo&s;e the&s;e bonds, and will &s;et them free; as Chri&s;t did break the bonds of death, for death was not able to hold him in his grave, <HI>Act.</HI> 2.24, So he will knock off the fetters of death from all his, and bring them forth, and make them happy; and this as &s;urely as he him&s;elf is ri&s;en, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.13. &amp;c.

<P>What are the po&s;itive be&s;&s;ings that by Chri&s;t we are made free unto. For Chri&s;t did come to poor &s;inners, to redeem them when Captives, not only that they &s;hould not be mi&s;erable, but that they &s;hould al&s;o be happy. The&s;e things are many and great and glorious; let me give you a ta&s;te in the&s;e few:</P>
<P N="1">1. By Chri&s;t believers have freedom and liberty to come to the throne of Grace. A burden to wicked gracele&s;s hearts it is, to come and pray to God, are backward to it, weary of it, as if it were a part of their &s;lavery and bondage, to come and beg for mercy for their Souls, for pardon for their &s;in, for converting and renewing grace now, and for eternal endle&s;s glory hereafter. Judge of this as you will, yet know it co&s;t Chri&s;t dear to purcha&s;e this liberty for us; it is not only a duty that we mu&s;t, but it is a real priviledge that we may, have the
<PB N="192" REF="004934_0097_100E33E64D699418">
freedom to come to God upon our knees, to beg for &s;pecial, &s;piritual, temporal and eternal mercies. Would not a poor pri|&s;oner, that hath de&s;erved to dye, account it a priviledge to have liberty as oft as he will, and when he will to have liberty of ac|ce&s;s unto the King, to prefer his petitions to him, and beg for a pardon of his fact, and for the &s;aving of his life; and all this with hope of &s;peeding and obtaining what he doth petition for? When man hath &s;inned, he was driven out of Paradi&s;e, and was a|fraid becau&s;e of guilt, and there was no freedom for the rebellious &s;inner without Chri&s;t, to come before a provoked angry God with hopes of mercy; but there is a new and living way now found out for you, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.19, 20, 21, 22. that you might come with freedom, and a&s;k with freedom of &s;pirit, and with freedom of &s;peech, what Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed for you, and God hath promi&s;ed to you, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.12, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.16. You may with freedom come to God, and tell him all your grievances, and all your burdens, and all your temptations, and all your wants, and open all your heart unto him.</P>
<P N="2">2. By Chri&s;t believers have a freedom and a liberty to apply the promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel to them&s;elves. The&s;e promi&s;es are
<PB N="193" REF="004934_0097_100E33E64D699418">

Here is a promi&s;e of pardon, and it is made to me; a promi&s;e of more grace and of per&s;everance, and it is made to me, a promi&s;e of eternal life and glory, and the ble&s;&s;ed glorious God hath made it unto me, and by Chri&s;t I may freely apply it, and build and re&s;t upon it.</P>
<P N="3">3. By Chri&s;t we are made free to all the priviledges of redeemed people. The&s;e are al&s;o many, great, and precious; very many, very great, and very precious priviledges.</P>
<P N="1">1. Believers by Chri&s;t are free to a &s;tate of friend&s;hip and favour with God. As there is a freedom betwixt friends, &s;o there is be|twixt God and his redeemed by Chri&s;t, that are partakers of the benefits of his re|demption; from a &s;tate of enmity to a &s;tate of friend&s;hip and reconciliation; God is no more your enemy, nor you any longer ene|mies to God, a peace is made by Chri&s;t be|twixt God and your &s;ouls, and this is a firm and la&s;ting an everla&s;ting peace, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.20, 21. Now with comfort thou maye&s;t con|clude, though men do hate me, yet God

<P N="2">2. By Chri&s;t Believers are free to a &s;tate of Ju&s;tification, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is freely imputed to them.

<P N="3">3. By Chri&s;t believers are made free to a &s;tate of Son&s;hip, and the priviledge of A|doption. Of Slaves you are become not only Servants but Sons; of the children of the Devil, are become the children of God; of the children of God's wrath, the children of his love. Men may redeem Captives but do not adopt them for their children, but all that Chri&s;t redeems, have the liber|ty to become the Sons of God, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12. 2 Cor. 6. latter end.</P>
<P N="4">4. By Chri&s;t believers are free to have communion with God in his Ordinances. God is no longer a &s;tranger to them, nor they any longer &s;trangers unto God; but have &s;weet conver&s;e and fellow&s;hip with God, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.3. They come to duty, and meet

with God in duty; in praying, hearing, and receiving, they have experience of the gracious, powerful, and heart-quickening, and &s;oul-comforting, chearing, &s;oftning in|fluences of the Spirit of God, and of the goings forth of their Souls in love unto de|&s;ires after, and delight in God. And when it is &s;o, how &s;weet is this unto their Souls!</P>
<P N="5">5. By Chri&s;t believers are free to a right to heaven &amp; to the enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ed glo|rious God for ever in his Kingdom. They are made free to the happine&s;s of the life to come; they &s;hall have free admi&s;&s;ion into the heaven|ly Paradi&s;e; the gates of heaven &s;hall be &s;et wide open for their departing Souls, freely, without any &s;top or hinderance, they are free in part now, and they &s;hall be perfectly free among the Saints in glory when they dye, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.21. This glory is prepared for them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.34; and they are prepared for it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.23. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.12. And what &s;hall be your happine&s;s then, is beyond the power and ability of any man upon earth fully to declare unto you, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.8. It might be better done by a glorious Angel that is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, than by a &s;inful (though &s;anctified) man, that lives, and waits, and hopes, and prayeth in ex|pectation of it.

<P N="1">1. Labour to convince thy &s;elf that thou wa&s;t born in bondage, a &s;lave by nature to Satan and Sin. The Phari&s;ees did not be|lieve that they were in bondage, and there|fore

him&s;elf, to bring us forth from our Bon|dage: and that you might be the more af|fected, and inflamed with his love, con&s;ider how far he acted for poor Captives beyond whatever man did for any man.</P>
<P N="1">1. How many Captives Chri&s;t engageth for! How many millions he became a Surety for, for their ran&s;ome and deliver|ance! one man might be bound and be|come a Surety for one, or two, but who will be Surety for thou&s;ands? I e&s;pecially if you add,</P>
<P N="2">2. The greatne&s;s of the Debt of tho&s;e he became a Surety for; One man might he per&s;waded to be Surety for another, if the Debt be &s;mall; but if it be for thou|&s;ands and for millions, men are &s;hie, but if it be for multitudes that owe &s;uch great &s;ums, every one &s;o much, who will be per|&s;waded to be Surety for them? but if they be in Pri&s;on or in Bondage there they lie for want of money of their own, or Sureti&s;hip from another. But Chri&s;t became Surety for multitudes, and each one owed abun|dance, that it doth pa&s;s the &s;kill of the a|ble&s;t Arithmetician to ca&s;t up the total &s;um that one of the&s;e Pri&s;oners were in Bon|dage for.</P>
<P N="3">3. Chri&s;t knew mo&s;t certainly that he &s;hould pay undoubtedly the Debt of all, he
<PB N="210" REF="004934_0106_100E33FD9F106868">
became a Surety for. Many men are Sure|ties for others, hoping they &s;hall never be called upon for the Debt, but that the Debtor will pay it him&s;elf; &s;ome will be bound for a man, whom they judge to be worth as much as they owe and more too; but if it be a poor man, not worth one far|thing, and his debt be thou&s;ands, who will then become Surety for him? a Pri&s;oner he is, and &s;o he is like to be: and if any be|come bound for another, and pay the debt for him, what trouble doth this cau&s;e un|to him? it breaks his &s;leep, and he is di&s;|plea&s;ed with him&s;elf, that ever he entred in|to bond, and &s;aith it &s;hall be a warning to me, while I live, how I become a Surety for another; I thought him able enough, el&s;e I would not have brought my &s;elf into &s;uch &s;nares.</P>
<P>But all this was known to Chri&s;t, when he did become our Surety. He knew our beggary and our poverty, that we could not contribute the &s;malle&s;t mite, towards the &s;atisfaction to be made in order to the free|ing of the Captives from their Bondage; and he knew that God would not &s;pare him, but exact the utmo&s;t from him, and yet he did voluntarily undertake our ran&s;ome. Oh what love was this!</P>
<P N="4">4. Chri&s;t became a Surety for you, when
<PB N="211" REF="004934_0106_100E33FD9F106868">
you were a &s;tranger to him. He did un|dertake to relea&s;e you out of your Bonds and Fetters when you had no &s;pecial actu|al relation to him, Some men will not be Sureties for their mo&s;t intimate acquaintance, and near relation, not for a Brother, father, &s;on, but for a &s;tranger who will do it? here|in then admire the love of Chri&s;t that when you were in Chains of &s;in and guilt, and a &s;tranger too, Chri&s;t did undertake and did pay a ran&s;ome for you.</P>
<P N="5">5. Yet more to affect your heart, Con|&s;ider, that Chri&s;t did ran&s;om you from your Captivity when you were an enemy unto him. A man might po&s;&s;ibly take &s;ome pity on a &s;tranger, but an enemy that hates him, and that would and doth di&s;honour and reproach him, who would be deeply engaged for him? yet Chri&s;t did this for you, when you were enemies unto Chri&s;t. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.10.</P>
<P N="6">6. Yet to rai&s;e your admiration and af|fection more, Con&s;ider Chri&s;t did become a Surety for you, before you did or could de&s;ire any &s;uch kindne&s;s at his hands. What Man or Angel could have thought of the ran&s;oming of Captives by the Son of God becoming the Son of Man, and God him|&s;elf redeem us by his blood? How long

might you a&s;k, how many might you go to, and how many entreaties might you u&s;e before you can prevail with one to be engaged for much, when you have nothing of your own? but Chri&s;t did this for us all, before any man had any &s;uch de&s;ire in his heart, thought in his mind, reque&s;t in his mouth, that he would do &s;o great and wonderful a kindne&s;s for us.</P>
<P N="7">7. Chri&s;t did this alone, without any other engaging with him. Men require counter-&s;ecurity. If I be bound for you (&s;aith one) you &s;hall find another to be bound with me, to be bound to me, to &s;ave me harmle&s;s; or you &s;hall make over &s;uch hou&s;es, or &s;uch lands for my &s;ecurity, that if I be called upon, or the Bond be put in &s;uit again&s;t me, I might &s;ave my&s;elf: But as Chri&s;t did tread the wine-pre&s;s of God's wrath alone, &s;o did he alone undertake to ran&s;om and redeem us from our bondage and captivity.</P>
<P N="8">8. Chri&s;t did never repent of this under|taking, nor de&s;ired to &s;tand bound no lon|ger. Men engaged for others, when they fear they will fail, make all means they can to get out of the bond, and to &s;tand &s;urety no longer; they will &s;carce &s;leep till they have got them&s;elves free, though the party that is the principal debtor be arre&s;ted and
<PB N="213" REF="004934_0107_100E33FFB33A6910">
put in pri&s;on. But Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord-Redeemer and Surety, to bring us out of bondage was can&s;tant to the death; and when <HI>Peter</HI> did di&s;&s;wade him from &s;uffering (which was the payment of our ran&s;ome) how &s;harply did Chri&s;t rebuke him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.21, 22, 23? Yea he was de&s;irous of the time of actual performance. <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.50. <Q>I have a bapti&s;m to be baptized with, and how am I &s;traitned till it be accompli&s;hed.</Q> Chri&s;t never &s;aid, it doth repent me, that I did ever undertake to ran&s;om Captive &s;in|ners; God &s;aid indeed, it did repent him that he made man. <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.6. but Chri&s;t never did repent that he had engaged him|&s;elf to redeem &s;inners.</P>
<P N="9">9. Con&s;ider what it was that was tha price that Chri&s;t did give to make you free from your captivity. Men might be Surety for men to pay a &s;um of money; but Chri&s;t became our Surety to the &s;hedding of his own mo&s;t precious blood. Men might give &s;ome money to redeem a Captive from Turki&s;h &s;lavery; but Chri&s;t him&s;elf, his Life, his Soul and Body, to bring us from our bitter bondage, and mi&s;erable captivity. Thus take &s;ome time to ponder upon the Lord your &s;urety, that did &s;o freely under|take the ran&s;oming of your captivated Souls. Which was the fourth head to get your
<PB N="214" REF="004934_0108_100E34042DB61E30">
hearts affected with this priviledge of being &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Con&s;ider, That God was plea&s;ed to accept of the undertaking of Chri&s;t, and what he hath laid down for your ran&s;om from captivity. God might have exacted the debt from man that did owe it. It is a voluntary act for a man to become a &s;urety, no man is to be compelled to it; and it is a voluntary act of the creditor to accept of &s;uch a &s;urety, they are both free and at their choice; but when the one offers him&s;elf to become bound, and the other doth accept of his &s;ureti&s;hip, then is the debtor or pri&s;oner relieved.</P>
<P>It was free love in Chri&s;t to become our Redeemer, it was grace in God to accept of Chri&s;t's ran&s;ome for us. The Son might have &s;aid, Man hath &s;inned, why &s;hould I &s;uffer? Man hath de&s;erved the wrath of God, let him undergo it: And the Father might have &s;aid, Man hath tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed my Law, and violated my Covenant, and I will make him &s;ruffer for it; they have brought them&s;elves into bonds of mi&s;ery, and they &s;hall lie therein, and they that &s;inned, them|&s;elves &s;hall die. Oh wonder then at this ble&s;&s;ed agreement between the Father and the Son, for the bringing forth poor Souls in Bondage from their Captivity.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="004934_0108_100E34042DB61E30">Sixthly, From all the former it follows the Salvation of &s;uch as are made free, is &s;ure and certain. Heaven now belongeth unto you; and the glory above you have a title to; Doth Satan object again&s;t you, that you have &s;inned, and de&s;erved to lie in everla&s;ting Chains, you might reply: it is true, but Chri&s;t is my Surety and Redeemer, and hath &s;et me free? Doth the Law of Con&s;cience accu&s;e you, you might an&s;wer all from the Ran&s;om of your Redeemer. Do you fear the Ju&s;tice of God, why your Debt is paid by your Surety, and then the Debtor cannot be ca&s;t into Pri&s;on. The Surety and the Debtor in Law are but one Per&s;on, and the Surety is liable to make &s;atisfactory payment, <HI>Prov.</HI> 22.26, 27, and Chri&s;t hath done it, and you di&s;charged.</P>
<P>God hath given &s;ome to Chri&s;t, whom he is to bring to Heaven; and they &s;hall not peri&s;h, <HI>John</HI> 6.38, 39, 40. as <HI>Judah</HI> did engage to <HI>Jacob</HI> for <HI>Benjamin; Gen.</HI> 43.9. <Q>I will be Surety for him, of my hands thou &s;halt require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and &s;et him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever.</Q> And therefore when <HI>Benjamin</HI> was to be de|tained by <HI>Jo&s;eph, Judah</HI> pleads hard, and offers him&s;elf to abide in his &s;tead and to be
<PB N="216" REF="004934_0109_100E3406F9FB1FD8">
a Bondman there; &s;o that <HI>Benjamin</HI> might return to his Father with his Brethren <HI>Gen.</HI> 44.33. Chri&s;t hath undertaken to bring all tho&s;e out of their Bonds and Fetters, which the Father gave unto him, and to &s;et them in Heaven before him. The price is paid, the Bonds are broken, the Chains fallen from your Souls, in which you were held while unconverted: as he hath open|ed the Pri&s;on-doors that you might come forth, &s;o he will open to you the Palace gates that you may enter in: for hopes hereof be thankful, be exceeding thankful and re|joyce in the Lord your Redeemer.</P>
<P>Second Exhortation. The next Duty I would pre&s;s upon you is, to be compa&s;&s;ionate, and to put on tender bowels of pity towards tho&s;e that yet are bound in the Fetters and Chains of their &s;in and guilt; while&s;t you do rejoice in that you are free, do not for|get to commi&s;erate them that yet are Cap|tives.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let Mini&s;ters think of this when they are &s;tudying for, and praying for, and preach|ing to their people, how they be in Bondage and in &s;lavery, and that except their Chains be loo&s;ed &amp; their Fetters, broken and knock|ed off, their &s;ouls are lo&s;t for ever, and that they will be fa&s;ter &s;hortly, bound hand and Foot and ca&s;t into a place of outer and

eternal darkne&s;s; &s;ome &s;erious and believ|ing thoughts of their pre&s;ent danger, and their future mi&s;ery would put more life into all we do for their recovery and prevention of their everla&s;ting condemnation. Should we then preach unto them with &s;uch luke|warmne&s;s, as if we were telling them a tale, or &s;aying &s;uch things in that manner, as if we did not believe our &s;elves the things we do declare? or as if it were no matter I whether our hearers did believe, receive and obey the Me&s;&s;age we deliever to them or no? when yet they be the great and weigh|ty truths of everla&s;ting Life or Death: to preach a Redeemer to Captive &s;ouls what &s;kill and life, and love doth it require? what zeal and pity to their Souls doth it call for? Oh that God would pardon the want of the&s;e in me, give me that belief of their eternal &s;tate and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of heart, that I may ever &s;peak and preach the Doctrine of Re|demption to en&s;lave &s;inners, as to tho&s;e that are undone for ever, except they be pre|vailed with to come to him, &s;ubmit to him, accept of him, and give up them&s;elves to be His wholly, and to be his only that hath paid the ran&s;om for their deliverance. When &s;ome years &s;ince I was called occa&s;ionally to preach to the Pri&s;oners in New-gate, and &s;aw my Hearers come in Fetters, and heard their
<PB N="218" REF="004934_0110_100E34091D847908">
Chains ratling at their heels, methoughts it was an affecting &s;pectacle to &s;ee men before me that were &s;hortly to be called to the Bar of Men, and be tried for their lives, and &s;ome likely to be &s;entenc'd to death and put to execution: but if we do behold our Hearers &s;tanding before us, though free from &s;uch material Chains of Iron, yet bound fa&s;t in their lu&s;ts and &s;ins, that con&s;ider they mu&s;t be &s;hortly tried at the Bar of God, and if not delivered by Chri&s;t, mu&s;t receive a &s;entence of death, bani&s;hed from the pre|&s;ence of the ble&s;&s;ed God, ca&s;t down to de|vils and damned Spirits, it &s;hould move us to pray for them, weep over them, and preach unto them, with greate&s;t pity and compa&s;&s;ion. To &s;tand and view &s;o many per&s;ons, among&s;t whom many are the De|vil's Captives, whom he is leading Fettered to eternal perdition, &s;hould rai&s;e in our hearts &s;trong workings of affection towards them, and &s;peak unto them with that ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and tender love, as becometh tho&s;e that are &s;peaking in the Name of God to lo&s;t &s;inners, in order to their recovery and de|liverance from Captivity.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let Parents that are made free, pity and compa&s;&s;ionate their Children that yet are bound. If any of your Children &s;hould be laid in Irons for &s;ome Fact committed

again&s;t the Laws of men, and carried bound to Execution, would not this like a Sword pierce your very hearts, be matter of grief and trouble to you? would not tears plen|tifully flow from your eyes, and bitter la|mentations from your mouth, that ever you &s;hould bring forth, and bring up children that &s;hould end their days in &s;uch reproach and infamy to you and them? or if any of you had a Son abroad, and you &s;hould hear he were taken Captive by the Turks, or were in the Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition, what &s;hed|ding of tears! what ringing of hands! what &s;miting on the brea&s;t would the&s;e tidings make! what dolorous complaints and grie|vous moans would you make! &s;aying, Oh my Son, my Son, my poor afflicted and di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Son, thou art fallen into the Hands of barbarous and cruel men; thou art put to drudgery and &s;lavery! O my Son, my Son, what &s;hall I do for thee, my Son. O that I could give or find a ran&s;om for him! if all I have would &s;et him free, he &s;hould not lie in Chains and Fetters, nor continue in that &s;ore Captivity! Why, you Pa|rents! would you thus lament the mi&s;ery of your Children's body, and do you make nothing of the mi&s;ery of your Children's &s;ouls! would you thus take on, and grieve and mourn for their outward Bondage,
<PB N="220" REF="004934_0111_100E340DF88204C8">
which is con&s;i&s;tent with the good condition of their &s;ouls, and will &s;hortly have an end, and yet it is nothing to you, to &s;ee them in their &s;piritual bondage, captivated by Satan, and in danger of being ca&s;t into an everla&s;t|ing Dungeon of black and thick Darkne&s;s! Oh why do you not &s;peak to them, and tell them of their mi&s;ery and their remedy; how they came into this condition, and how they may get out of it? why do you not day and night plead with them, in&s;truct them, and exhort them, that they may e&s;|cape the Torments of Hell hereafter, by being brought out of their bondage now? why do you not pray to God, that he would make them free? why do you not plead at the throne of grace, and &s;ay, Lord I have Children that are Satan's Captives, my poor Children are fa&s;t bound in Fetters of &s;in, in the Bonds of iniquity, O thou God of grace that ha&s;t &s;hewed favour unto me, &s;hew fa|vour to my children al&s;o! Oh that they may be relea&s;ed! Oh that thou would&s;t plea&s;e to pity them in their Bondage, and for the ran&s;om of thy Son let them be re|deem'd and by the powerful workings of thy Spirit have their wills &s;ubdued, and in|clined to accept of the only Redeemer; him thou did&s;t &s;end to proclaim Liberty to Captives, Oh that by thy grace thou would&s;t

cau&s;e them to come in, and lay hold upon the mercy granted in the Proclamation of the Go&s;pel, that they might not peri&s;h in their Bonds.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let Ma&s;ters that are made free and &s;et at liberty have compa&s;&s;ion on their &s;ervants that are fettered in their Chains of &s;in. They are not only bound to you (to be &s;o bound is in order to their good and free|dom) but are al&s;o bound in the Cords of their Iniquity, which is their pre&s;ent &s;lave|ry, and tendeth to their eternal mi&s;ery; doth it not pity you, to &s;ee your Servants, to be &s;ervants of the Devil, and in bondage to their lu&s;ts? doth not your Hearts work within you to con&s;ider that any under your Roof &s;hould be drudges unto Satan? or do you &s;ee this, and have you nothing to &s;ay unto them all the week long, to make them apprehen&s;ive of their Danger, and &s;en&s;ible of their mi&s;ery? is it enough for you to teach them the &s;kill and art of your trade, and at the expiration of &s;even years to make them free, while you do neglect to help them (as in&s;truments under God) out of the thraldom of Satan and of &s;in? or can it &s;atisfy you that they have at the end of their Service to you, the freedom of the City or Corporation where you and they do dwell, while they are not brought into the liberty

of the Sons of God? or can you have peace in the neglect of your duty, to think they came into your family Bond-&s;laves to &s;in, and after &s;even years time, they go out as they came in? or &s;hould you not endeavour that they may be &s;piritually free, while they continue &s;ervants unto you? Oh how would they have cau&s;e to ble&s;s God for you, and that ever they came within your doors, and dwelt within your walls, if they may &s;ay, when I fir&s;t became a Servant to my Ma&s;ter, I was a Servant to my lu&s;ts al&s;o, but by his in&s;tructions, admonitions, and example, I became a &s;ervant of God, before I cea&s;ed to be a &s;ervant unto him? If it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, let it not be through your neglect; for as it will not be without &s;in and mi&s;ery to your &s;ervants, &s;o neither will it be without guilt on you.</P>
<P>The like I might urge upon other Rela|tions, acquaintance and friends, hu&s;bands to have compa&s;&s;ion on their Wives, wives on their hu&s;bands, one Neighbour on another; you that know what it is to have been in the&s;e Bonds, and what it is to be made free, do your utmo&s;t to help and &s;uccour them that be in chains of &s;in, and know not the evil of it, nor the good of the contrary con|dition; and therefore mourn not under the one, nor de&s;ire to be bro't forth into the other.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="004934_0112_100E3410EFAB4710">Third Exhortation. Were you in Bonds, and are they broke? in Fetters and are they knocked off? then walk in the whole cour&s;e of your lives as becomes a ran&s;omed and redeemed people. It will not become you to live and act as others do; as there is a wonderful difference between your con|dition, and the condition of others, &s;o there mu&s;t be between your Conver&s;ation and the Conver&s;ation of others. See that you be humble, holy, heavenly: &s;ee that you be fruitful in every good work: faithful to your Lord Redeemer, and be no more in|tangled with tho&s;e Sins and &s;nares you are delivered from. Now you are enlarged, walk clo&s;e with God, holy &s;trictne&s;s is the greate&s;t and the true&s;t liberty. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 119.45. <Q>I will walk at liberty: for &s;eek thy Precepts.</Q> Remember he that hath call|ed you to liberty, gives you not leave to li|centiou&s;ne&s;s, but to tread in the paths of piety. Go on then, hold on your way, continue and per&s;evere therein to the end, and when the Servants of Sin, at the co|ming of Death, and the Day of Judg|ment, &s;hall be bound in a place of dark|ne&s;s, pain and torment, you &s;hall be free in a Place, a Palace of Re&s;t and Light, of Life and Love, &s;inging, &s;ounding forth the everla&s;ting Prai&s;es of your Redeemer.</P>
