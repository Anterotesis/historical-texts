<HEAD>The Publi&s;her TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>I Was advi&s;ed by &s;ome pious Per&s;ons, who de&s;ire Peace and Union among&s;t Chri&s;tians, to re-print this Di&s;|cour&s;e, in hopes of its good Effect on all impartial Readers.</P>
<P>The Arguments being wholly Scriptu|ral, are not only convincing, but mana|ged with &s;o much Charity, that few Books of Controver&s;y in Religion can expect a better Reception.</P>
<P>Upon a &s;erious peru&s;al of this Piece, it will appear clear and evident, That who&s;oever ju&s;tly &s;u&s;tains the Character of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, hath, be&s;ides his Internal Qualifications, an External Vi&s;ible Commi&s;&s;ion deliver|ed to him, by tho&s;e who have Power and Authority to grant it: From whence the&s;e Inferences do naturally flow.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="002417_0003_0FDB3E1907DA0A50"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Mini&s;ters of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who freely own that the Power of Ordinations was fir&s;t ve&s;ted in the Apo&s;tles, and from them, through all Ages &s;ince, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> from whence they derive their own Or|dinations, are to be acknowledged true Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it is a daring Of|fence to intrude into the &s;acred Function, without a regular de&s;ignation to the Ex|erci&s;e of it. See <HI>Numb. 16.40. 2 Sam, 6.6, 7. 2 Chron. 26.19, 20, 21, 22. Heb. 5.4, 5.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That People ought to en|deavour after all the A&s;&s;urance they can attain to, that they have the Means of Grace in the Word and Sacraments, duly admini&s;tred and di&s;pen&s;ed unto them, by Per&s;ons fully authorized for tho&s;e holy Offices. For &s;ince the <HI>Prie&s;t's Lips are to pre&s;erve Knowledge,</HI> the People ought to be &s;atisfied that they are really &s;uch, at who&s;e Mouth they <HI>&s;eek the Law.</HI> And,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That it is a very criminal Pre&s;umption, and an un&s;ufferable In&s;o|lence
<PB N="iii" REF="002417_0004_0FDB3E1C6A6FFBB0">
in &s;ome, to value their Gifts at &s;o high a rate, as to think them&s;elves by the virtue of them, entituled to the Mini&s;terial Office, without being admit|ted by the Impo&s;ition of the Hands of tho&s;e, whom Chri&s;t has ordered to pre|&s;ide over the affairs of his Church.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That &s;ince there is no ap|proaching before God's Altar, without the appointed Rites of Con&s;ecration, nor any medling with his In&s;titutions with|out his Order and Command; Tho&s;e in|vaders of the &s;acred Services, cannot be &s;aid to be the <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors of God,</HI> or accounted the <HI>Stewards of the My&s;|teries of Chri&s;t,</HI> who pre&s;ume to touch tho&s;e holy Things, with their unhallow|ed Hands, and like <HI>Saul,</HI> would &s;acri|fice without a Call, <HI>1 Sam. 13.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</HI> For tho&s;e who offer <HI>&s;trange Fire before the Lord,</HI> their Incence mu&s;t be <HI>an Abomination to him, Levit. 10.12.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Tho' we can by no means que&s;tion our Saviour's Gifts and Abili|ties, yet he did not enter upon his Mini&s;try, until he was &s;olemnly inaugu|rated

Matth. 28.19, 20.</HI> And they al&s;o before their Death, imparted their Power to others, by Impo&s;ition of Hands. Thus the Apo&s;tles ordained &s;even Dea|cons, <HI>Act. 6.5, 6.</HI> among other Servi|ces, to <HI>Preach</HI> and to <HI>Baptize,</HI> in the Exerci&s;e of which Offices we find St. <HI>Philip,</HI> one of them, diligently employ|ed, <HI>Acts 8.1</HI> &amp;c. Thus <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> ordained Elders in every Church, <HI>Acts 14.23.</HI> And thus St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who had ordained <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> appointed <HI>Titus</HI> to ordain El|ders in every City in <HI>Crete, Tit. 1.5.</HI> And that the&s;e &s;acred Offices &s;hould con|tinue

This is the &s;tanding Mini&s;try that the Church of <HI>England</HI> claims a Part and Lot in: This is the Nature and true Notion of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, as we find it founded by our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles.</P>

<HEAD>A Mode&s;t Proof OF THE <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> Settled by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles IN THE CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P>MY de&s;ign is at pre&s;ent, to repre&s;ent to the World, what was the primitive Model, or Form of Church-Govern|ment; what was &s;ettl'd by our Saviour, and his <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> in this point; and that from what is recorded of the matter in the Books of the New-Te&s;tament: This is evident from the Title-page; and the end of this undertaking is in order to let all Parties contending for various Forms &s;ee which is really the right one, with which if they compare their own, they
<PB N="2" REF="002417_0008_0FDB3E238A577218">
may be enabl'd to continue it or reject it as it agrees with, or deviates from the fir&s;t In&s;titution.</P>
<P>Now the Church however harra&s;&s;ed and di&s;quieted, with a great variety of Di&s;putes and Debates, about points of <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cipline;</HI> yet heard little or no noi&s;e made, for above 1400 years, a|bout <HI>this</HI> point of <HI>Church-Government.</HI> One <HI>Aerius</HI> &s;tarted a debate, but had &s;o few to &s;econd him that it died with him&s;elf, and left his name on record among <HI>Hereticks.</HI></P>
<P>The goodly Order and <HI>Government</HI> in|&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, &s;tood firm for many Ages; and under it the Church flouri&s;h|ed, and the Chri&s;tian Religion mightily prevailed, notwith&s;tanding the violent Per&s;ecutions of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> times: But at length it was invaded, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the U&s;urpation and Tyranny of the <HI>Romans Papacy.</HI> A <HI>&s;ecular Power,</HI> and <HI>Dominion</HI> was &s;et up; and the <HI>Doctrine, Wor&s;hip,</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> of the Church, following the fate of its Government, were corrupted. Error, Super&s;tition, Idolatry and Tyran|ny, the Pillars of the Papal Kingdom, were introduced: And all maintained, on the one hand, by a mo&s;t fal&s;e and bla&s;|phemous Preten&s;ion to an Ab&s;olute infal|lible Power and Authority derived from Chri&s;t; and on the other, by a mo&s;t horrid and cruel Per&s;ecution of all who
<PB N="3" REF="002417_0009_0FDB3E25004215F8">
did but matter the lea&s;t Di&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Thus lay the Church for &s;ome Ages, groaning under this <HI>Anti-chri&s;tian U&s;urpa|tion,</HI> &s;truggling and wre&s;tling even unto Blood and Martyrdom, to recover its primitive Purity and Liberty. It plea&s;ed the Lord at length, to deliver it in part, and to retrieve its <HI>Doctrine, Wor&s;hip, Di&s;|cipline</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> by a longwi&s;h'd for Reformation: A Reformation which had been much more happy and compleat, had not the <HI>Adver&s;ary</HI> &s;cattered his Tares among the good Seed which &s;prung up in Briars and Thorns: Had not &s;ome Doctrines and Cu&s;toms, maintained by one part of the Reformed Church, and rejected by an other, occa&s;ioned not di&s;|putes, which gave no le&s;s di&s;turbance to the Church, than they yielded Plea&s;ure and Diver&s;ion to the <HI>Common Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>Among other differences this was one; that while the greate&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;i|derable part of the Reformed Church, retained the Ancient Order and <HI>Govern|ment,</HI> and vindicated it from the U&s;urpa|tions and Encroachments of the <HI>Papacy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cal.

Churches:</HI> But this did not prevent Di&s;putes upon that Head, and every Church defending its own Model, as mo&s;t agreeable to the fir&s;t In&s;titution, the debate came to that height, as to occa&s;i|on a &s;ad Rupture and Schi&s;m; a Schi&s;m which has produc'd no where more wo|ful effects, than in the&s;e three Kingdoms: What Alienation of Minds among profe&s;|&s;ors of the &s;ame <HI>Reformed Religion,</HI> what Confu&s;ions and barbarous Cruelties, what Convul&s;ions and Revolutions in Church and State, what publick and private Mi&s;|chiefs, have &s;prung from this Root of Bitterne&s;s, the Hi&s;tories of the pa&s;t Age, give a very &s;ad and lamentable Account: And above all, the malignant Influence it hath had on Religion, to ob&s;truct the Life and Practice of true Chri&s;tianity, cannot be &s;ufficiently <HI>regretted.</HI></P>
<P>I doubt not but the <HI>Common Enemy,</HI> and they who&s;e trade it is to fi&s;h in muddy Waters, have been very active to <HI>blow this Coal;</HI> but that which hath &s;ometimes made this Debate break forth in <HI>Ve&s;uvian Flames,</HI> and be di&s;puted with Fire and Sword, with Blood and Wounds, is, That it hath been incorporated into, and join|ed with other Political Debates and State-differences; It were ea&s;ie to demon&s;trate this, did not the evidence of it render it needle&s;s; that <HI>Political Intere&s;ts</HI> and <HI>State-differences,</HI>

have all along been interwoven with this conte&s;t about <HI>Church-Govern|ment,</HI> and have &s;upported and maintained it: And perhaps at the Bottom, 'tis none of the lea&s;t prejudices again&s;t <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> that they of that Per&s;wa&s;ion have gene|rally a&s;&s;erted the <HI>ju&s;t Rights</HI> and <HI>Preroga|tives of Princes,</HI> as the &s;ure&s;t Foundation of a Kingdoms Happine&s;s and Tranqui|lity; and accordingly have maintained the Doctrines of <HI>Non-re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience,</HI> &amp;c. whereas its Rival <HI>Govern|ment</HI> hath been thought by &s;ome, more &s;erviceable for Checking and Curbing the <HI>Power of Princes.</HI> Certain it is, there is <HI>too</HI> much of a Carnal and worldly Spi|rit, that keeps this Debate &s;o long alive; and there is little hopes it will die,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.3.</NOTE> till Chri&s;tians be more animated with the true Spirit and Temper of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible there have been many Vo|lumes which have appear'd in the World upon this Argument, which may &s;eem, or be expected to have exhau&s;ted the Subject on both &s;ides; and this may be a prejudice again&s;t my pre&s;ent undertak|ing, as &s;uperfluous: And the little good effect tho&s;e Volumes have had, may make it be look'd upon as Pre&s;umption in me to fancy that what I have to offer will do any good, where &s;o little has been effected by tho&s;e that have gone before me.

<P>Indeed all the difference expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e two <HI>Mi&s;&s;ions,</HI> is, that we read not of &s;uch a <HI>&s;olemn Inauguration</HI> of the <HI>&s;eventy</HI> unto their Office, as of the <HI>twelve;</HI> and that the <HI>Twelve</HI> were particularly ho|noured with the Title of <HI>APOSTLES,</HI> even before they were &s;ent forth (of the importance of which Name, we &s;hall af|terwards enquire); but the <HI>&s;eventy,</HI> tho' they were &s;ent forth immediately by Chri&s;t, are no where &s;o called, but only

<P>Thus have we &s;een two Orders of Go&s;|pel Mini&s;ters in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t him&s;elf.

<P>Of this In&s;titution I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, That <HI>it</HI> was made by the <HI>twelve Apo&s;tles,</HI> to whom the <HI>Government</HI> of the Church was principally committed, and who had Power and Authority to in&s;titute new Offices and Officers as the Exigence of the Church &s;hould require; That the&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="002417_0018_0FDB3E3E87016D30">
<HI>Deacons</HI> were appointed and &s;et apart to their Office by the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> with the Ce|remony of <HI>Prayer and Impo&s;ition of Hands,</HI> which was u&s;ual in de&s;igning and ap|pointing Per&s;ons to any &s;acred Office, in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try: And further, that the&s;e <HI>Deacons</HI> thus &s;eparated and ordain|ed, were inve&s;ted with &s;ome &s;hare of the <HI>Apo&s;tolick Office,</HI> particularly of <HI>Preach|ing</HI> and <HI>Baptizing,</HI> as well as managing the publick Stock of the Church, which they exerted in &s;ubordination to the <HI>A|po&s;tles,</HI> under their In&s;pection and by their Direction; That <HI>Stephen</HI> was a Preacher (and the re&s;t of them, of whom we have nothing on record, &s;ave their Names) as well as <HI>Philip,</HI> cannot be doubted. <HI>Stephen</HI> by his Zeal in propagating the Go&s;pel, became the fir&s;t Martyr; and of <HI>Philip</HI> we expre&s;ly read, that by his Preaching, he converted <HI>Samaria</HI> and initiated the Converts there, into the Chri&s;tian Pro|fe&s;&s;ion by <HI>Bapti&s;m.</HI> Hence we afterwards find him dignified with the honourable Title of <HI>Philip the Evangeli&s;t,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 8. and 21.2.</NOTE> though but one of the Seven.</P>
<P>This I ob&s;erve to &s;hew, the va&s;t dif|ference betwixt the&s;e <HI>Go&s;pel Deacons</HI> in|&s;tituted and ordained by the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who are named <HI>Deacons</HI> under the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Model, without any Ordina|tion or Power to Preach or Baptize, that

<P>Thus much &s;hall &s;erve to &s;hew what I promis'd in the fir&s;t place, what &s;acred Offices were in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles in the Church.</P>
<P N="2">II. I now come to what I promis'd in the &s;econd place, to make it appear how the&s;e Offices were di&s;tingui&s;hed; and to demon&s;trate an imparity among them.</P>
<P>Now of the la&s;t mentioned, there is no debate; all acknowledge that <HI>Deacons</HI> were different from, and inferiour to the two former Offices of Apo&s;tles, and the Seventy; 'tis of the&s;e two that &s;ome are plea&s;ed to pronounce that they are one and the &s;ame; whereas what I have al|ready ob&s;erved of their In&s;titution, plain|ly &s;hows them to have been di&s;tinct Offices, and they are every where &s;poken of in Scripture as &s;uch: particularly in that enumeration of Go&s;pel Officers, I <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28. <HI>God hath &s;et in his Church, fir&s;t Apo&s;tles, &s;econdarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers: Are all Apo&s;tles, are all Prophets, are all Teachers?</HI> Though every Apo&s;tle was a Prophet and Teacher, the Superi|our Order including the Inferiour; yet every Prophet and Teacher, was not an

Apo&s;tle (as for the re&s;t in that Enume|ration, they are not di&s;tinct Offices, but various and different Powers and Gifts wherewith the Go&s;pel Officers were en|dued.)</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing then the <HI>Deacons</HI> inferiour to the Apo&s;tles and Seventy, the que&s;tion is concerning the <HI>twelve</HI> who were called <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and the <HI>&s;eventy and others of their Order,</HI> who go by the name of Prophets, in a Go&s;pel Sen&s;e; Mini&s;ters of the Word and Sacraments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 15.32. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.20.

<P>I &s;ay, the que&s;tion is whether the&s;e <HI>Prophets, Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Evange|li&s;ts,</HI> were of the &s;ame Office and Order with the <HI>Apo&s;tles?</HI> Or, whether they were of a <HI>di&s;tinct Office</HI> and <HI>Order,</HI> and inferiour to that of the <HI>Apo&s;tles?</HI> For clearing this we mu&s;t con&s;ider their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ions,</HI> and the Exerci&s;e of their Office conform|able to their Commi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t of the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> All that their fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion did bear, was to Preach the Go&s;pel and to Admini&s;ter the Ordi|nances of Religion; and this was all the exerci&s;e of their Apo&s;tolick Office that we read of, during Chri&s;t's bodily pre|&s;ence with them, and in this, (as I &s;aid)

Edification, good Order and Government, <HI>to the end of the World,</HI> as is evident from what hath been &s;aid; there mu&s;t of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity be a Succe&s;&s;ion of Per&s;ons, duly called to the&s;e Offices, according to Chri&s;t's In&s;titution, that the Offices them|&s;elves may be capable of continuing &s;tanding in the Church.</P>
<P>And to erect and &s;et up a new Office Paramount to the&s;e in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, &s;uch as the <HI>Papacy,</HI> is intolerable Pre|&s;umption; for who can have a Power and Authority in the Church above <HI>A|po&s;tles</HI> who were Chri&s;t's immediate De|legates, but Chri&s;t him&s;elf?</P>
<P>And it is no le&s;s Pre&s;umption to cut off, or abrogate any of the&s;e Sacred Of|fices: 'Tis an overturning that Order e&s;tabli&s;hed by Chri&s;t in his Church, and altering and changing his In&s;titution: It is a Sacrilegious Robbing the Church of the&s;e Mini&s;ters which Chri&s;t in his in|finite Wi&s;dom thought nece&s;&s;ary for her Edification and Perfection.

<P>If it be pretended, that now at lea&s;t, in the pre&s;ent State of the Church, both

the <HI>Apo&s;tolick</HI> and <HI>Prophetick Offices,</HI> may be, to as good Purpo&s;e, and as great Be|nefit of the Church, performed by the <HI>ordinary Pa&s;tors,</HI> acting in <HI>Parity,</HI> and that it is therefore needle&s;s to keep a di&s;tincti|on of Offices: This is to pretend to be wi&s;er than Chri&s;t: It is to confound and jumble together the different Orders in|&s;tituted by him: It is to &s;et up a new Model different from what he not only e&s;tabli&s;hed, but al&s;o appointed to conti|nue in his Church to the end of the World; it is to ca&s;hier Chri&s;t's <HI>prime Officers</HI> and <HI>Repre&s;entatives,</HI> and the Chur|ches <HI>principal Guides:</HI> And to deprive the Church of the Pledges of her Lord's Care and Kindne&s;s which he gave her, when he A&s;cended up unto Heaven.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="002417_0049_0FDB3E8379F85CD0">
of the Apo&s;tolick Office, Chri&s;t hath in|&s;tituted the &s;tanding Office of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> in his Church, that is an Order of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, Superior to Pa&s;tors and Teach|ers, to whom he hath committed the Power and Authority above-mentioned.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were actually <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and their <HI>Apo&s;tle&s;hip</HI> a proper <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> as it is expre&s;ly called, <HI>Acts</HI> 1.20. and that they actually exerted an <HI>Epi&s;copal Power</HI> and <HI>Juri&s;diction</HI> over the Churches, and the ordinary <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Teachers, Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> I have fully &s;hew|ed in the Second Inquiry.

<P>And in con&s;ulting them we find it evi|dent, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were a <HI>Supe|rior Order</HI> of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters to <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Ordinary Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Teachers:</HI> That to the&s;e Apo&s;tles Chri&s;t Committed the chief Care &amp; Government of his Church, as his &s;pecial and immediate Delegates and
<PB N="44" REF="002417_0050_0FDB3E872620A690">
Tru&s;tees: That the <HI>Inferior Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> did always own and acknow|ledge the Apo&s;tles as their Superiors, and did readily receive and obey their Orders: That this <HI>Apo&s;tolick Order,</HI> Superior to <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> was to continue in the Church: all which we have fully cleared from Scripture in the former En|quiries. Now, what Order of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters is there, <HI>Superior to Ordinary Pa|&s;tors and Teachers,</HI> but that of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> in whom the Apo&s;tolick Order is continued in the Church?</P>
<P>Either then <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> mu&s;t be the true Succe&s;&s;ors of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> or el&s;e they have no Succe&s;&s;ors at all, and the <HI>Apo&s;to|lick Order</HI> and <HI>Office</HI> is quite Extinct, and the Church is totally deprived of the prime and chiefe&s;t Office in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t for its Edification, good Order and Government: And finally, There is now no &s;uch Order of Men extant in the World, to whom that large and ample Commi&s;&s;ion which Chri&s;t gave only to his <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> does belong: To them it was he gave the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, the Power of Binding and Loo&s;ing: Them he &s;ent as his Legates and Amba&s;&s;adors to the World, as the Father had &s;ent him: Them he in&s;tru|cted in, and entru&s;ted with the great Affairs of his Kingdom, and to them he

made that encouraging and gracious Pro|mi&s;e, <HI>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the World.</HI> Now, who can lay Claim to that Commi&s;&s;ion, or the Pro|mi&s;e annexed, but the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and their <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors?</HI> And if they have no Succe&s;|&s;ors now, that they them&s;elves are Dead, all that Commi&s;&s;ion falls, and the Pro|mi&s;e with it; which is ab&s;urd to think, and 'tis horrid even to conceive what con&s;equences would follow.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is evident al&s;o from Scrip|ture, That the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> in their own time did confer upon other; the <HI>Apo&s;tolick Power and Authority;</HI> which they had never done, if they had thought that the Office was confined to their own Per&s;ons, and was to end with their re&s;pective Lives: They under&s;tood better the Mind of their Lord and Ma&s;ter, and the Importance of his Promi&s;e, to be with them <HI>to the end of the World.</HI> Hence they rightly conclu|ded, That they were to commit the Com|mi&s;&s;ion given to them, unto the Hands of other faithful Per&s;ons, who &s;hould in like manner tran&s;mit it to others in a continual Succe&s;&s;ion, <HI>to the end of the World.</HI> Accordingly their fir&s;t Work was to chu&s;e one to &s;ucceed <HI>Judas;</HI> and by the Direction of God, <HI>Matthias</HI> is recei|ved into the number of the Apo&s;tles: So when <HI>James,</HI> the Brother of <HI>John,</HI> is

<P>If it be &s;aid, That <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> acted only as <HI>Paul</HI>'s Delegates, it weakens not the Argument, but rather corroborates it, for it &s;till holds that there was in the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> a <HI>Superior Power and Office,</HI> above that of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> which might be con|ferred upon and committed to another, whether by Delegation, or by Inve&s;titure and Ordination of the Per&s;on into the Office, to which that <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> belonged, comes all to one. It is to as little purpo&s;e to &s;ay, that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> exerci&s;ed this Power and Authori|ty over the Pa&s;tors of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> and <HI>Crete,</HI> as <HI>Evangeli&s;ts:</HI> for 1.

<P>And what hath been hitherto ob&s;erved, makes it to me, very evident, and I think may make it to any other unprejudic'd Per&s;on at lea&s;t highly probable, That the <HI>Angels</HI> of the <HI>Seven Churches</HI> of the le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> were Per&s;ons of the <HI>Apo&s;tolical</HI> and <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Order: For &s;ince there was &s;uch an Office of <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t in his Church, who&s;e Office was to Superintend Churches and the Pa&s;tors thereof, and by their Authority to &s;ettle good Order, to prevent and cor|rect Abu&s;es and Corruptions in <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>People:</HI> Who el&s;e could the&s;e <HI>Angels</HI> be, but Officers of this higher Order? Who therefore are accountable for, and charged Particularly with, any Di&s;order or Corruption tolerated in their re&s;pec|tive Churches: And commended for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing and correcting the&s;e Di&s;or|ders, and Purging their Churches of Heretical Teachers.</P>
<P>And, Finally, we cannot entertain the lea&s;t Doubt of it in our Minds, but that the <HI>Holy Apo&s;tles,</HI> to whom our Lord gave &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion and Power, to Plant and Settle, and Govern his Church in his Name, would be mo&s;t faithful and exact,
<PB N="51" REF="002417_0057_0FDB3E998EF82B28">
in &s;ettling that Order, and In&s;tituting the&s;e Offices, in all fully con&s;tituted Churches, which their Lord had appoin|ted; and would be careful to leave the Church at their Death, under the &s;ame Order and Government, furni&s;hed with the &s;ame Offices and Mini&s;ters which Chri&s;t him&s;elf her Lord, had in&s;tituted and appointed for her Edification.</P>
<P>Neither can it be conceiv'd, that any. Chri&s;tian Church could look on her&s;elf as rightly Con&s;tituted, if any of the&s;e &s;acred Offices in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles had been wanting.</P>
<P>And now, having plainly from uncon|te&s;tible Matters of Fact, Recorded in the New Te&s;tament, repre&s;ented the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> the different Offices and Powers in&s;tituted by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> in the fir&s;t modeling of the Chri&s;tian Church; I might add for Confirmation of all that has been hitherto alledg'd, that all the Records we have of the <HI>Ancient</HI> and <HI>Primitive Church</HI> do harmoniou&s;ly atte&s;t, That this <HI>Order,</HI> and the&s;e <HI>Offices</HI> in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, were inviolably pre|&s;erved for many Ages; and &s;o po&s;itive are they, as to that <HI>prime Office</HI> of <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> that they give us particular Catalogues of the Bi&s;hops who &s;ucceeded the Apo&s;tles, in governing the mo&s;t fa|mous and principal Churches in the

World: But to in&s;i&s;t on this, would force me beyond the Bounds within which I propos'd to contain my &s;elf in my fir&s;t Entrance upon this Subject.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore only give the Te&s;ti|mony of <HI>Calvin</HI> in this Matter, becau&s;e perhaps his Authority may go further with &s;ome, than that of the Ancients: You will find it in the 1&s;t and 4th Sections of the 4th Chapter of his In&s;titutions, where treating of the State of the Church, and the Form of its Government before the Papacy, he &s;ays to this purpo&s;e: <Q>It will be u&s;eful in this Matter, to know and con&s;ider the Form of the Ancient Church, which will repre&s;ent before our Eyes, a certain Image of the Divine In&s;titution: Although the Bi&s;hops of tho&s;e Times, framed many <HI>Canons,</HI> by which they &s;eem to &s;train Things be|yond what is expre&s;&s;ed in Holy Writ; yet with that Caution did they frame all their Order and Government, ac|cording to the only Rule of God's Word, that you may ea&s;ily &s;ee they had almo&s;t nothing in this Matter di&s;agreeable to the Word of God. Yea, though &s;ome|thing might be wanting in their Order, yet, becau&s;e with a &s;incere Study they endeavour'd to pre&s;erve God's In&s;titu|tion, and erred not much from it, it will be very profitable, briefly to re|count

what kind of Cu&s;tom they had. As we have &s;hown, there is a threefold Mini&s;try commended to us in Scrip|ture; So whatever Mini&s;ters the ancient Church had, it di&s;tingui&s;hed them into three Orders, <HI>Bi&s;hops, Presbyters,</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI></Q></P>

<P>And I would conclude with the&s;e Words, but that I am obliged, for further clearing what hath been hitherto ob&s;er|ved, to con&s;ider &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of Scrip|ture that are commonly objected again&s;t what I have advanc'd.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> 'tis alledg'd, that the Names of <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter</HI> are promi&s;cuou&s;ly u&s;ed in Scripture, and therefore they &s;ig|nifie but one and the &s;ame Office: It is An&s;wered by &s;ome, That this is a great Mi&s;take: And that wherever <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> are named, we are to under&s;tand <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> pro|perly &s;o called, and not <HI>Presbyters,</HI> which they make appear from the Texts brought in favour of the Community of Names; for In&s;tance, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.27, 28. They &s;ay, <HI>Paul</HI> called both <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> un|to him, and that the Clergy of all the Cities thereabout were there; for <HI>Paul,</HI> during his three Years abode in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> had Conver&s;ed with the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Pres|byters</HI> of other Places, than of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and his appealing to their Knowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 18.</NOTE> proves that they were pre&s;ent, &s;o that what he &s;ays, <HI>ver.</HI> 28. was principally directed to the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and &s;econdarily and by way of Reflection to the <HI>Presby|ters.</HI> To <HI>Titus</HI> 1. Ver. 5, 6, 7. it is an|&s;wer'd,
<PB N="55" REF="002417_0061_0FDB3EA0037BC8E0">
That what is there to be found, only proves that he &s;hould Advance the <HI>Presbyters</HI> under him, and Ordain <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and Di&s;po&s;e of them unto Cities, fixing them to certain Cures; &s;o it follows, <HI>for a Bi&s;hop mu&s;t be blamele&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. There were Presbyters before at <HI>Crete,</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> was to ordain &s;ome of them <HI>Bi&s;hops:</HI> So 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. is to be under&s;tood of Bi&s;hops <HI>properly &s;o called,</HI> that were to be ordained to pre|&s;ide over other Cities, as <HI>Timothy</HI> did over <HI>Ephe&s;us. Phil.</HI> 1.1. may be under&s;tood of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Philippi,</HI> and other neigh|bouring Cities, who were wont to con|vene and meet together; or it may mean that <HI>Paul,</HI> and the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> that were with him, Salute the Saints at <HI>Philippi.</HI> This An&s;wer however not obvious to every one, yet clearly &s;hews how uncertain that alledged Identity of Names is.</P>
<P>But though we &s;hould not look upon this An&s;wer as ab&s;olutely conclu&s;ive, but grant an Identity of Names; yet it will not follow, that there was an Identity of Offices; for Names are common in Scrip|ture, where Offices are acknowledged to be di&s;tinct. Thus <HI>Hebrews</HI> the 3d and the 1&s;t, Chri&s;t is called an <HI>Apo&s;tle;</HI> and 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.25. he is called a <HI>Bi&s;hop;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 5.1. John, Ep. 2.3. 1 Cor. 3.5. 2 Cor. 3.6. Col. 4.7, 17.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> call them&s;elves <HI>Presbyters;</HI> and the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> are frequently called

<HI>Deacons.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The&s;. 3.2.</NOTE> Now it cannot from thence be argued, that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> Office was one and the &s;ame with the <HI>Deacons:</HI> The Name of the <HI>Genus</HI> is u&s;u|ally given to the <HI>Species:</HI> The Superior Office including the Inferior, all <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> though not <HI>vice versa:</HI> Therefore the Identity of Offices is not to be argued from the Iden|tity of Names: for according to the Pres|byterians them&s;elves, the Name <HI>Presbyter</HI> is common to the Pa&s;tor, and Ruling Elder, yet the Offices are va&s;tly di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> &s;everal Texts are addu|ced, in which 'tis alledged, That <HI>Parity</HI> among Church-Offices is <HI>peremtorily</HI> com|manded; &s;uch as Matth. 20.26. <HI>The Lords of the Gentiles,</HI> &amp;c. and the parallel places, <HI>Luke</HI> 9.47, 48. <HI>Luke</HI> 22.24. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.3. To which 'tis an&s;wered in general, That the&s;e Scriptures cannot by any ju&s;t Rules of Interpretation be under&s;tood as con|demning a Di&s;parity among Go&s;pel Mi|ni&s;ters, nor a Superiority of one Order above another; nor a more eminent Power and Authority in &s;ome to Govern the Church above others; nor all Ju|ri&s;diction of one Go&s;pel Office above others, but only that, which is exerci&s;ed with imperious Bitterne&s;s and Domina|tion; nor are they interpreted to any &s;uch purpo&s;e by any Judicious Per&s;on of
<PB N="57" REF="002417_0063_0FDB3EA4A77ACFC0">
either Per&s;wa&s;ion: So that it is not fair, hone&s;t, or ingenuous Dealing, in any to make u&s;e of the&s;e Texts, as condemning <HI>Imparity</HI> among Go&s;pel Officers, in order to amu&s;e the <HI>Populace</HI> and Simpler Sort, who are oft-times &s;oon taken with the Sound of Words, without con&s;idering the true Sen&s;e and Importance of them.</P>
<P>But to an&s;wer this Objection more particularly, 1&s;t, That only is forbidden Go&s;pel-mini&s;ters, which was practi&s;ed by <HI>the Lords of the Gentiles,</HI> that is, Secular Dominion and Authority; and it was certain, it was this that the Di&s;ciples had in their View, when they contended who &s;hould be greate&s;t; for they were migh|tily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Opinion, that Chri&s;t's Kingdom was to be a Tem|poral Kingdom; and it is this mi&s;take that Chri&s;t removes.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That Dominion which the Lords of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> exerci&s;ed, was not one over another, but over their Subjects, &s;o that if it take away all Power of one above another, it will de&s;troy the Power of Mi|ni&s;ters over their Flocks: Now, though <HI>Lording over God's Heritage</HI> is expre&s;ly di&s;|charged;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 5.3. Heb. 13.7.17.</NOTE> yet the <HI>Pa&s;tors Power and Autho|rity over them,</HI> is expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, where they are called Rulers, and the People commanded to obey them: It would al&s;o de&s;troy the Power of Synods and Presby|ters,
<PB N="58" REF="002417_0064_0FDB12B1D7EB65D8">
where Mini&s;ters rule over Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, There are in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> &s;ome Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, which plainly imply a Supe|riority or Eminency of Power, in &s;ome over others, when it is &s;aid, <HI>He that is greate&s;t among you:</HI> And when Chri&s;t pro|po&s;es his own Example in what he there enjoyns them, &s;aying, <HI>I am among you as one that mini&s;treth;</HI> yet none will doubt he was their Lord and Superior, &s;o that the command of Mini&s;tring takes not away the Superiority and Power.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, It cannot be thought that our Saviour condemned a Di&s;parity among Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, when it is &s;o evident that he actually in&s;tituted Mini&s;ters of dif|ferent <HI>Offices</HI> and <HI>Degrees,</HI> fir&s;t <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> then <HI>Seventy</HI> others of a Second Order; and his Apo&s;tles in&s;tituted a Third Order of <HI>Deacons,</HI> who 'tis certain was Inferior to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as the&s;e were to the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly, If our Lord had de&s;igned to for|bid all <HI>Di&s;parity</HI> or <HI>Subordination</HI> among the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel; 'tis like, he would rather have &s;tated the Oppo&s;ition between them and the Mini&s;ters of Reli|gion under the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, and not the Lords of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Thirdly,</HI> whereas that Pa&s;&s;age in the 1&s;t of <HI>Timothy,</HI> the 4th Chapter, and 14th Ver&s;e, is brought to prove, That Presbyters have a Right or Power to or|dain
<PB N="59" REF="002417_0065_0FDB3EA9E7697270">
Presbyters, and other Go&s;pel Mini|&s;ters: It is an&s;wered, That place proves no &s;uch Thing. For S. <HI>Jerome,</HI> a zealous A&s;|&s;erter of the Rights of Presbyters, acknow|ledges that Ordination belongs, if not <HI>&s;olely,</HI> yet <HI>chiefly</HI> to Bi&s;hops. And both Ancients and Modern, and among the&s;e, <HI>Calvin,</HI> under&s;tand Presbyter in the afore|&s;aid Place, not of the <HI>Con&s;e&s;&s;us</HI> or <HI>Collegium Presbyterorum,</HI> the A&s;&s;embly or Con&s;i&s;tory of Presbyters; but of the <HI>Munus</HI> or <HI>Office it &s;elf,</HI> or the Ordination of the Office of a Presbyter; &s;o that the Laying on of the Hands of the Presbyter &s;ignifies no more than when he was ordained a Pres|byter; as if St. <HI>Paul</HI> had &s;aid, Take heed that the Grace conferred on thee, when I ordained thee a Presbyter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calv. In&s;tit. Lib. 4. Cap. Sect. 16. ad finem.</NOTE> be not in vain: Thus <HI>Calvin</HI> interprets that place; and what confirms this Glo&s;s, is the <HI>Kari&s;ma,</HI> or <HI>Gift</HI> &s;poken of, &s;eems to have re&s;pect to the&s;e extraordinary Gifts conferred by the <HI>Laying on of the Hands of the Apo&s;tles</HI> in the Ordination of Pa&s;tors, to which the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Concurrence of others was not nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But granting that <HI>Presbytery</HI> is to be under&s;tood of the meeting of Presbyters, yet it will not prove that they had full Power and Authority to Ordain; for here, at the mo&s;t they did but concur and a&s;|&s;i&s;t in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy,</HI> as is
<PB N="60" REF="002417_0066_0FDB3EAB486D8FF0">
evident from 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6. where the Apo&s;tle calling him to &s;tir up that Gift, &s;ays, that it was conferred on him <HI>by laying on of Hands.</HI> Certain it is, that Apo&s;tles did Ordain without the Con|currence of Presbyters; but I read not that ever Presbyters ordain'd without an Apo&s;tle or Bi|&s;hop; and in an Action of that Nature and Im|portance, it may at lea&s;t be a ju&s;t ground of Doubt and Scruple, that there is no Warrant or Precedent to be found for it in Scripture, with|out which I know not how any can be fully per|&s;waded in his own mind. How far an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity may alter the ca&s;e according to the common Axiom, <HI>That many things may be lawful for a Senate when they have no King, that are not when there is one,</HI> I &s;hall not determine.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AND now having fini&s;hed what I de&s;ign'd at pre&s;ent, that is, having demon&s;trated from the Scripture's Account of the&s;e Matters, what was at fir&s;t &s;ettled in it, and having thence deduc'd what is at pre&s;ent the true Form of Go|vernment in the Church of Chri&s;t: I &s;hall only add, by way of <HI>Conclu&s;ion,</HI> a &s;hort Expo&s;tulation, in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s and Love; and calmly enquire, What is the Ground of all that Noi&s;e and Clamour, Hatred and Prejudice, rai&s;ed a|gain&s;t them who are of the Principles, as to the Point of Church Government, which are here a&s;&s;erted?</P>
<P>'Tis evident we own Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord,
<PB N="61" REF="002417_0067_0FDB3EAF3218D828">
Head, King, and Lawgiver to his Church, who hath Power and Authority to &s;ettle and e&s;tabli&s;h Order and Government therein, and to in&s;ti|tute and appoint what Offices, and in what manner he plea&s;es, in his Spiritual Kingdom.</P>
<P>We are fully per&s;waded, that He, who is of Infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, hath di&s;po&s;ed all Affairs relating to the Government of his Church, in the mo&s;t excellent method, in the way and manner that tends mo&s;t for the Peace and Unity, Order and Security, Edification and Salvation of his Church and People.</P>
<P>We find, plainly and expre&s;ly, Three di&s;tinct Offices in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles; one Prime and Chief, the <HI>Twelve Apo&s;tles;</HI> and two Subordinate, the <HI>Seventy Di&s;ciples,</HI> and Seven <HI>Deacons:</HI> The&s;e Three Orders of Go&s;pel-Mini|&s;ters are unque&s;tionably of <HI>Divine In&s;titution</HI> and Appointment. And we cannot find in all the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> that any of them was <HI>Extraordi|nary</HI> and <HI>Temporary;</HI> no, not the lea&s;t In&s;inuation to move us to think, that after a &s;hort time any of them was to cea&s;e. On the contrary, we have the &s;ame Evidence for their perpetual Du|ration, that we have for their fir&s;t In&s;titution.</P>
<P>And now let any impartially Judge, who do mo&s;t truly a&s;&s;ert Chri&s;t's Kingly Office, and the Prerogatives of his Crown? They who plead for his In&s;titution, and clo&s;ely adhere thereunto, and to the Offices which he hath appointed in his Church; or they, who make bold with his In&s;titution; to abrogate the <HI>prime Office</HI> he in|&s;tituted,
<PB N="62" REF="002417_0068_0FDB3EB079C67F30">
as how long &s;ince antiquated and out of u&s;e; and that only upon a fal&s;e and ground|le&s;s Suppo&s;ition, that it was <HI>Extraordinary</HI> and <HI>Temporary.</HI> The fal&s;ene&s;s of which I have al|ready &s;hewed under my Third Head, and &s;hall now repre&s;ent briefly of what a dangerous con|&s;equence it is to Religion, to alledge that any of the Offices in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, were <HI>Extra|ordinary</HI> and <HI>Temporary,</HI> appointed only to &s;erve the <HI>Infancy</HI> and <HI>Fir&s;t Con&s;titution</HI> of the Church, but not to continue in it when once con&s;tituted. This makes the Rule and Standard of our Reli|gion uncertain and unfixed, and opens a Gap to all Errors: At this rate, and upon the &s;ame pretence, <HI>Quakers,</HI> and others, ca&s;t off the Go&s;pel In&s;titutions, of <HI>Holy Orders, Bapti&s;m</HI> and <HI>the Lords Supper,</HI> &amp;c. for, &s;ay they, the&s;e were only <HI>Tem|porary Ordinances;</HI> but now all the <HI>Lord's People are Holy,</HI> they are all Prophets, the Manife&s;tation of the Spirit, which is given unto all, hath out|dated all the&s;e <HI>Rudimentary Elements.</HI></P>
<P>If any, thus principled, could but gain &s;uch an a&s;cendant over the <HI>Populace,</HI> as to in&s;pire them with this Notion, and thereby influence them as much again&s;t the Order of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as they have been again&s;t that of <HI>Bi&s;hops;</HI> What &s;hould then become of Order in the Church, or any Go&s;pel Ordinance? God forbid! That any &s;uch wild Caprice &s;hould ever &s;eize on Chri&s;tian People; but I make the Suppo&s;ition to repre&s;ent thereby the dangerous Con&s;equence of that Principle, <HI>That &s;ome of Chri&s;t's In&s;titutions were but Temporary:</HI> For it may be improved as much, and on as good

ground, again&s;t the Office of a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> yea, again&s;t the po&s;itive In&s;tructions of the Go&s;pel, as again&s;t the Office of a <HI>Bi&s;hop;</HI> and there may come &s;uch an unhappy Jun|cture, when one as well as another, and all as well as one, may thus come to be thought unnece&s;&s;ary. For alas, if the Truth may be told, 'tis greatly to be feared, that not only the Office of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> but of all <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> yea, all the <HI>Sacred In&s;titutions of Chri&s;t,</HI> are become intolerable unto too many <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, who want but a favourable Opportunity to vent their minds, and &s;ay, <HI>Come, let us break their Bonds a&s;under, and ca&s;t away their Cords</HI> from us.</P>
<P>How will they be able to an&s;wer God, or their own Con&s;ciences for it? Who have &s;olemnly combined toge|ther to ruin and overthrow that Order, &s;ettled by Chri&s;t in his Church, and have left no Stone unturned, in their re&s;tle&s;s Endeavours, to bring the Sacred Offices of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> Mini&s;tring under their In&s;pection and Govern|ment, into perpetual Contempts; and having indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;et them&s;elves to oppo&s;e and fru&s;trate all their Go&s;pel Ad|mini&s;trations; and not only to alienate the Minds of poor &s;imple People from their <HI>Lawful Governours</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> but with Noi&s;e and Clamour, and bitter Invectives, to in|&s;pire them with the highe&s;t Rage and Fury to commit the mo&s;t horrid Outrages on their Sacred Per&s;ons, as good Service done to God; and all upon no other Ac|count, but their firm adherence unto the In&s;titution of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Father forgive them, they know not what they do: Lord lay not this Sin to their change, but mercifully open their eyes, that they may &s;ee the evil of their ways, and may be converted to the Way of Truth and Godline&s;s, Peace and Charity, Unity and Or|der, and Eternall, Saved: Through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> Now unto GOD the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, be Glory Everla&s;ting. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
