<HEAD>CHARGE TO THE <HI>GRAND JURIES, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN we examine the principles of our Con|&s;titution, we have rea&s;on to admire it, as an excel|lent form of a free government: And when we con&s;ider its binding force and acknowledged autho|rity over all the branches of the admini&s;tration, we have rea&s;on to confide in it, as a &s;ecurity of liberty. That either the con&s;titution or its admini&s;tration &s;hould be perfect, it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of man, its agent and object, to expect. Can the work of man re&s;emble that of angels, or would the laws of angels control the vice and folly of man? We are yet on earth, and not in heaven; the im|perfection of our nature mu&s;t &s;how it&s;elf in all our works, and in all our conduct; and to the imperfec|tion and perver&s;ene&s;s of our nature mu&s;t our laws be adapted. The variety of the human mind ren|ders impo&s;&s;ible an uniformity of opinion: as well may we expect uniform &s;erenity of &s;ky, or con|&s;tancy
<PB N="4" REF="031694_0004_0FEE772C2884C1C8">of health. The genius of our government, dictating a ju&s;t regard to the &s;entiments of every individual, contributes, with the variety of our na|ture, to render vain the hope of general approba|tion. Where the iron yoke of de&s;poti&s;m weighs down every neck to an equality of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, opi|nion is u&s;ele&s;s, and complaint dangerous; and there is the acquie&s;cence of con&s;traint, and the &s;ilence of fear. But in a democratic government, where each man, while he feels his con&s;equence, mu&s;t feel his di&s;appointment; you may as well bid the water cea&s;e to ruffle, when the wind blows, as think to prevent di&s;&s;atisfaction, &s;uppre&s;s murmurs, or &s;till clamour. The&s;e ari&s;e out of our nature, and our government; and, like other evils, may be le&s;&s;ened by prudence and &s;kill, but cannot be removed.</P>
<P>To have been in a &s;ituation of difficulty and dan|ger, and to be extricated without injury, lo&s;s, or cau&s;e of regret, is more than human nature, or hu|man fortune will permit us to hope. To have ad|ju&s;ted the &s;ufferings, &s;ervices, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">s of a revo|lution, and an eight years' war; to have prepared, on a new and untried plan, and to have created in|tere&s;ts to &s;upport, a frame of government for thir|teen extended and independent &s;tates, of various prejudices and views; to have admini&s;tered the go|vernment of tho&s;e &s;tates, under all the errors of its &s;tructure, and the perils of their condition; to have reformed this government, and adapted it to their
<PB N="5" REF="031694_0005_0FEE77320FE054C0">varying circum&s;tances; and, hitherto, di&s;appointing the malicious hopes of our enemies, and the affec|tionate fears of our friends, to have conducted it pro&s;perou&s;ly amid&s;t the conflict of a world in arms; is a ta&s;k, which only the ignorant and thoughtle&s;s will deem light. And to have executed this ta&s;k, without many errors, and many complaints, would have required a wi&s;dom, a virtue, and a fortune, far above the lot of man. When we view our pa&s;t &s;teps, our pre&s;ent &s;tate, and our future fair and rea&s;onable pro&s;pects, every candid and intelligent man, who ju&s;tly e&s;timates the difficulty of our affairs, and the frailty of our nature, will &s;ee abun|dant rea&s;on to re&s;pect the wi&s;dom and virtue of tho&s;e, by whom our government has been admini|&s;tered, and to admire the felicity of our fortune.</P>
<P>As we ought not to hope in man, for the virtue of angels, neither ought we to fear, in him, the ma|lice of devils. A weak and erring creature, he is &s;ometimes mi&s;led by ignorance, and &s;educed by temptation; but when he wilfully does wrong, it is for &s;ome cau&s;e, other than the plea&s;ure of doing it. The way to keep man right, therefore, is to point out clearly his duty, and remove from him all inducement to depart from it. The man who, in this &s;ituation, does wrong, mu&s;t have a degree of malignity not common in human nature; and the man who can ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e it in another, mu&s;t find &s;omething in him&s;elf inclining him to do it. In this
<PB N="6" REF="031694_0006_0FEE775F0F03D770">&s;ituation our con&s;titution, as nearly as practical &s;kill and prudence can direct, has placed all tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with its admini&s;tration. The limits of authority are pre&s;cribed, and temptations to abu&s;e of authority are, as much as po&s;&s;ible, remo|ved. No man can make laws to bind others, and not him&s;elf. No man can judge in his own cau&s;e. The authority of every man may be examined, and every man's abu&s;e of it puni&s;hed. All duty is de|fined; all power is limited; all intere&s;ts are the &s;ame. There is no power but, in &s;ome way, is derived from the whole community, and, in due progre&s;s, returns to it. There is no power, which abu&s;e of it does not determine. There is no privi|lege, office, or tru&s;t, which is not acce&s;&s;ible to the merit of any citizen; none, which his merit can tran&s;mit to his po&s;terity. There are no offices, tru&s;ts, or pen&s;ions, but for the public benefit; none, which the public will cannot aboli&s;h. What more effectual guards, than our con&s;titution has e&s;tabli&s;hed again&s;t temptation to human frailty, could human prudence invent? That tho&s;e who have admini&s;tered the government have erred, may be true; and that they may err, is true; for they are men. But, as the con&s;titution has, as much as po&s;&s;ible, removed temptation, we cannot, without proof, or without admitting our own corruption, &s;uffer our&s;elves to believe, that they have erred wilfully.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="031694_0007_0FEE77351E3D7098">
Be&s;ides that &s;ecurity of liberty, and a faithful admini&s;tration, which the principles of our con&s;titu|tion, and the nature of man afford us, we have an additional &s;ecurity, in the <HI>&s;tation</HI> of tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of our government. If the elective branch exerci&s;e its powers with judgment and fidelity, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that the admini&s;tration &s;hould be wrong; for it will fill all offices with men of under&s;tanding, integrity, and knowledge: and &s;uch appointments mu&s;t produce a good admini&s;tration. Con&s;idering therefore (as, where the elective branch acts properly, we ought to con&s;ider) that appointment to office is an evi|dence of under&s;tanding and knowledge, we have, in &s;tation a &s;ecurity for a faithful admini&s;tration. There is in under&s;tanding and knowledge a power, which tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them not, cannot feel, al|mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tibly impelling to acquire reputation, by a faithful di&s;charge of duty. Under&s;tanding and knowledge furni&s;h a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the importance of virtue, and in&s;pire the mind with a de&s;ire of it: and however they may &s;ometimes yield to &s;trong temptation, it requires far &s;tronger temptations to baffle the judgment, where they exi&s;t, than where they exi&s;t not. Let, therefore, the elective branch always fill offices with under&s;tanding and know|ledge, as mo&s;t ju&s;tly and readily valuing and em|bracing duty.</P>
<P>Together with the con&s;titution, nature, and &s;ta|tion, we have in that <HI>character,</HI> which &s;tation en|ables
<PB N="8" REF="031694_0008_0FEE77277B3DFC30">public officers to form, a further &s;ecurity of a good admini&s;tration. Is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that under&s;tanding and knowledge, which &s;o &s;trongly impel to pur&s;ue virtue and duty, will not as &s;trongly impel to retain them? Character, reputation, or a good name, is not ea&s;ily acquired, and will not le&s;s reluctantly be abandoned. It is not in the nature of man readily to give up that which we have hardly acquired and highly value. Is it ea&s;y to conceive, that a Wa&s;hington or an Adams, who have derived all their fame from their exertions in the cau&s;e of liberty, would abandon the &s;ource of their glory and their pride?</P>
<P>We find, therefore, in the nature of man, in our political con&s;titution, and in the &s;tation and cha|racter of tho&s;e who admini&s;ter it, a competent &s;ecu|rity of our liberty, and a faithful admini&s;tration. And I am per&s;uaded, that an accurate review of all the pa&s;t tran&s;actions of our government will &s;a|tisfy every intelligent and candid mind, that they are all con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;incere de&s;ire for the pub|lic good, and generally well calculated to promote it; that the errors in it have been fewer than in other governments in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, and that, to account for tho&s;e errors, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;pect corruption or any de&s;ign again&s;t liberty; for they may all be accounted for, by the fallibi|lity of human judgment, and the variety of human opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="031694_0009_0FEE77382C523100">
But why then, if our government has been &s;o admini&s;tered, and we cannot hope for perfection, do we hear complaints? Complaint is as natural to man, as error. Fal&s;e judgment is one of the natu|ral errors of man. And we are not le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to cen&s;ure others, than to approve our&s;elves. Let any man look back upon his pa&s;t life, and, with his own, compare the opinion of others, on his con|duct; and then &s;ay, whether others form a right judgment of his motives and actions. If others be mi&s;taken with re&s;pect to us, may not we be mi&s;ta|ken with re&s;pect to others? And may we not all be mi&s;taken, in the judgment we form of the admini|&s;tration of the government?</P>
<P>The admini&s;tration indeed may have been erro|neous; but, without &s;uppo&s;ing error in the admini|&s;tration, we may account for complaint, from the nature of man, and of our government. Where the powers of government are limited to a few, they are &s;uppo&s;ed to qualify them&s;elves for the ad|mini&s;tration of them; and others, who have no au|thority, may take no pains to examine or to judge, but &s;ubmit in &s;ilence. But, in our government, every citizen has a &s;hare in the admini&s;tration, and a right to examine its conduct. We are too apt to confound right with capacity, and power with &s;kill; to think our&s;elves qualified to do, what we are per|mitted to do; and, becau&s;e we <HI>may</HI> judge, to &s;uppo&s;e that we <HI>can</HI> judge. Politics, legi&s;lation, or
<PB N="10" REF="031694_0010_0FEE77291A80BAA0">the art of government, is a &s;cience, and like other &s;ciences, to under&s;tand it, requires knowledge, &s;tudy, and reflection. Re&s;pectable as this country is, we can hardly &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;tate of educa|tion and knowledge in it is yet &s;uch, as to enable all who <HI>may</HI> judge to judge <HI>rightly,</HI> of the conduct of admini&s;tration. And this difficulty is increa&s;ed by the readine&s;s, with which our intere&s;t directs us to admit &s;trangers to a participation of our privi|leges. We &s;ometimes &s;ee tho&s;e, who but a few months from Europe, and but ill qualified by pre|vious knowledge or experience, have had little op|portunity of under&s;tanding our intere&s;ts, &s;uddenly, and perhaps before they have acquired the charac|ter of citizens, become the mo&s;t forward to exa|mine, and the mo&s;t &s;evere to cen&s;ure, the mea&s;ures of our admini&s;tration. The difficulty, therefore, of general knowledge, will induce a prudent man, when he hears complaints of admini&s;tration, to he|&s;itate in deciding, whether the error be in the ad|mini&s;tration, or in the complaint; and to con&s;ider on which &s;ide there is the be&s;t chance for a right under&s;tanding of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the mechanic arts, a &s;tranger will frequently be at a lo&s;s to explain the u&s;e, and frequently be di&s;po&s;ed to cen&s;ure the folly, of the different opera|tions of the arti&s;an. But this happens more rarely in the common arts, becau&s;e the effect is &s;o imme|diately connected with the operation, that we can
<PB N="11" REF="031694_0011_0FEE773F5EF2FD28">more readily di&s;cern its u&s;e, and form a right judgment. In the &s;ciences, phy&s;ic, law, &amp;c. where our ignorance is greater, and can be le&s;s ea&s;ily cor|rected, our mi&s;takes are more frequent and more gro&s;s. Under no government, perhaps, has ju&s;tice been more purely and &s;kilfully admini&s;tered, than in courts of law, in our government. Yet do we not &s;ometimes hear their deci&s;ions arraigned by the ignorant, as erroneous, and by the malevolent, as corrupt and prejudiced?</P>
<P>We all admit, that all nature is under the go|vernment of Almighty wi&s;dom: but is there any government, again&s;t which there are &s;o many com|plaints? Where is the man that could not pre&s;cribe better &s;ea&s;ons, better health, and better fortune, than we now receive from the Great Governor of the univer&s;e. If we are not plea&s;ed with the go|vernment of God, can we wonder, if the govern|ment of man di&s;plea&s;e us? And in whom, &s;hall we &s;ay, is the error?</P>
<P>Since we complain mo&s;t, where we lea&s;t under|&s;tand, we have rea&s;on to lay it down as a rule, that, where, as in our government, there is little temp|tation to error, complaints are in proportion to ig|norance, and ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>As our ignorance occa&s;ions complaints, our in|formation is often ill qualified either to ju&s;tify or
<PB N="12" REF="031694_0012_0FEE7760C6AB90B8">remove them. Our mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed <HI>clamourers</HI> frequently derive their information only from new&s;|papers. I would not be under&s;tood to throw out indi&s;criminate cen&s;ure; but new&s;papers are &s;ome|times publi&s;hed, not that they may be u&s;eful to the readers, but to the printers; not that they may in|&s;truct, but that they may be bought; and the ob|ject of the publi&s;hers is not &s;o much to inform the judgment by ju&s;t knowledge, as to excite pa&s;&s;ion and curio&s;ity, and &s;upport the party that will be&s;t &s;upport their cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>Sometimes al&s;o we &s;ee men, who, di&s;appointed by accident, or de&s;titute of u&s;eful talents to lead them to that rank or character, which their vanity or ambition &s;ugge&s;ts, &s;eek popularity by cen&s;ure and complaint again&s;t all mea&s;ures. Unable to comprehend, they &s;eem to dread, every propo&s;ition which comes not from them&s;elves, and fill the coun|try with their fal&s;e clamours and fooli&s;h fears.</P>
<P>When we combine all tho&s;e cau&s;es, we may, without admitting that the admini&s;tration of our government has been erroneous, perhaps ju&s;tly, wonder, not that the complaints have been &s;o many, but that they have been &s;o few.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e internal grounds of di&s;&s;atisfaction, there is another, from which &s;ome nations have &s;uf|fered much; but from which, I hope, we have
<PB N="13" REF="031694_0013_0FEE774775A89280">little to fear. The author of <HI>A Hi&s;tory of the late Revolution in Sweden,</HI> &s;ays, "The framers of the Swedi&s;h con&s;titution, by placing their liberties be|yond the reach of any attacks of their &s;overeigns, imagined they had effectually &s;ecured them; and forgot they had left a door open for another &s;pecies of corruption, equally fatal to liberty, and, in its con&s;equences, infinitely more ruinous to the coun|try, foreign corruption.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sheridan's Hi&s;tory of the Revolution in Sweden, Part II. &s;ect. 2.</NOTE>" To this cau&s;e tampering with the intere&s;ts and feelings of the people; em|barra&s;&s;ing the coun&s;els, and checking the energy of the government; and thus throwing the nation into confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s, he attributes that revo|lution, which re&s;tored the king to de&s;poti&s;m, and overthrew all tho&s;e barriers of liberty, which the framers of the con&s;titution had e&s;tabli&s;hed as effec|tual.</P>
<P>We, di&s;tant from the courts of Europe, and in|experienced in their intrigues, can have but little knowledge or &s;u&s;picion of the artifices, by which the greater play off the &s;maller &s;tates again&s;t each other. Under pretence of maintaining the peace of Europe, they are in a con&s;tant &s;tate of concealed ho&s;tility; and, to pre&s;erve the balance of power, each kingdom is perpetually on the watch for an opportunity of aggrandizing it&s;elf. Of tho&s;e Euro|pean
<PB N="14" REF="031694_0014_0FEE7766675CEB68">powers, France and Britain have long taken the lead; and with all the influence, which money and art can give, have mutually &s;triven to make every &s;maller &s;tate a thorn in the &s;ide of each other, and light up the flame of war, whenever their &s;eve|ral intere&s;ts might &s;ugge&s;t. For this purpo&s;e, they have maintained mini&s;ters at every court in Europe, to watch the conduct of that court, and the mini|&s;ters of other nations there. But as tho&s;e public agents mu&s;t be known and &s;u&s;pected, and &s;o le&s;s competent for the nece&s;&s;ary corruption and artifice; they have often been but &s;hadows, without real confidence or power, and have been directed to re|ceive in&s;tructions from others, who had no public authority. Or if they acted uncontrolled, together with them, there were often &s;ent others, who, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing talents without a name, and exciting no &s;u&s;|picion, could intrigue more &s;ucce&s;sfully. To tho&s;e public mini&s;ters and concealed agents of the courts of France and Britain, was intru&s;ted a competent management of powers and money. They inter|fered in all the internal mea&s;ures of the &s;tate in which they re&s;ided. They excited parties where they found none, and where they found parties they &s;upported them. In the&s;e intrigues, principle was altogether di&s;regarded; except the principle of embroiling the government on which they acted, and accompli&s;hing the purpo&s;e they meant to effect. While, at one time, in Holland, the agents of France &s;upported democratic or ari&s;tocratic fac|tions,
<PB N="15" REF="031694_0015_0FEE774FB01AAE98">becau&s;e the agents of Britain &s;upported de&s;|potic; in Sweden, they changed &s;ides; and each &s;upported that in one country, which it oppo&s;ed in another. And in the &s;ame country, at different times, they adopted a contrary conduct, as their intere&s;t or views &s;ugge&s;ted. In Holland, or in Swe|den, the mini&s;ter of France was, at one time, on the &s;ide of democracy, and another time on the &s;ide of monarchy, as he could be&s;t wield the foreign &s;tate to the purpo&s;es of his court. And the mini|&s;ter of Britain as certainly took the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to that which the French mini&s;ter headed. To &s;ecure his &s;ucce&s;s, each mini&s;ter di&s;tributed money, foment|ed prejudice, and &s;tirred pa&s;&s;ion, through the whole &s;tate: and the parties of the di&s;tracted nation, de|luded by their arts, or &s;educed by their wealth, be|lieved, or pretended, that they were &s;truggling for the intere&s;ts of their country, when they were con|tributing to its ruin. By &s;pies and bribes, tho&s;e foreign mini&s;ters pried into all the coun&s;els of the &s;tate which they were &s;ent to watch or corrupt. They endeavoured to influence all its conduct. If a treaty were ever &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and inoffen&s;ive, they affected di&s;&s;atisfaction, feigned injury, embarra&s;&s;ed its progre&s;s and execution, and excited clamour again&s;t it. If an election approached, they &s;pread abroad reports, and exerted influence, bribes, and corruption, to &s;ecure the appointment that mo&s;t fa|voured their views. The author whom I quoted, informs us, that when the &s;tates of Sweden a&s;&s;em|bled
<PB N="16" REF="031694_0016_0FEE7722E5C887F8">in 1765, the French amba&s;&s;ador was &s;uppo&s;ed to have laid out no le&s;s than 400,000 livres in the election of the mar&s;hal of the diet. But the En|gli&s;h and Ru&s;&s;ian mini&s;ters had taken their mea|&s;ures &s;o well, that the mar&s;hal was of their &s;ide. What then mu&s;t they have laid out!</P>
<P>He al&s;o informs us, that in 1766, Sweden con|cluded a treaty of Friend&s;hip with England; the chief article of which was, that the &s;ubjects of each nation were to enjoy reciprocally, in their re&s;pective kingdoms, ports, and harbours, all advantages and immunities which the mo&s;t favoured nation did then, or might afterwards enjoy. "Inoffen&s;ive," &s;ays he, "as this treaty was, France affected to be exceed|ingly di&s;&s;atisfied with it, as well as &s;urpri&s;ed at its being concluded without having been previou&s;ly communicated to her. She accordingly made u&s;e of it as a pretext for putting off the payment of a part of the &s;ub&s;idies which had been then &s;ome time due. She further threatened, that, in ca&s;e Sweden entered into a defen&s;ive alliance with Eng|land, &s;he would deprive the Swedi&s;h &s;hips of all the advantages they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the ports of France. There is &s;omething in the French amba&s;&s;ador's de|claration to the Swedi&s;h mini&s;try on this occa&s;ion, which gives &s;o true an idea of the dependence in which Sweden was held by France, that it de&s;erves a place here. <HI>The true rea&s;on of the delay of the payment of the &s;ub&s;idies is, that his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
<PB N="17" REF="031694_0017_0FEE775694EB9740">Maje&s;ty, had made in con&s;equence of treaties, which he religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, certain political arrangements relative to his interior affairs: That one of the&s;e ar|rangements of his Maje&s;ty, with regard to the North was that Sweden &s;hould conclude no treaty, without his Maje&s;ty's con&s;ent. That, in contempt of this en|gagement, the motive of the &s;ub&s;idies of France to the Swedi&s;h court, Sweden had made a treaty with a fo|reign power, without waiting for the con&s;ent of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty.

<P>Poland has long exhibited a melancholy example of the fatal effects of foreign influence on a divided people, and the deplorable &s;pectacle of a nation bro|ken to pieces by its own pa&s;&s;ions, and the violence of other powers. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, in his me|moirs from 1763 to 1775, has detailed (and he knew them well) &s;ome of the intrigues of foreign &s;tates, and the mi&s;erable pretexts under which they cover their ambition, rapacity, and hatred towards the unhappy nations whom they embrace in their cruel and in&s;idious policy.</P>
<P>Mirabean, the di&s;tingui&s;hed defender of French liberty, re&s;ided, &s;ometime before the revolution, as &s;ecret agent of France in Pru&s;&s;ia. Of the means, which &s;uch per&s;ons u&s;e, we may form &s;ome idea

<P>Though, as they always oppo&s;ed each other, one of them might &s;ometimes do good, yet it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the arts and money of tho&s;e fo|reign mini&s;ters, to learn and influence the coun|&s;els of the nation in which they re&s;ided, even when they promoted the good of that nation, were ex|erted for that purpo&s;e, or for any other purpo&s;e, than to promote the views of their own courts. Mirabeau, while at Berlin, &s;eems to have been the agent of Mr. Calonne, then in the French mini|&s;try; and is &s;aid to have written his letters to Talyrand Perigord, late bi&s;hop of Autun.

<P>If we examine the hi&s;tory of the minor &s;tates of Europe, we &s;hall find, that the agents of tho&s;e two nations, Britain and France, in oppo&s;ition to each other have been con&s;tantly engaged, in endea|vours to turn the coun&s;els and exertions of every other &s;tate, at whatever expen&s;e to it&s;elf, again&s;t the rival nation. Though war of the &s;word may have cea&s;ed, war of arts and intrigue never cea&s;ed between them. And though, to &s;ucceed, they might cover their intrigues under the &s;pecious pre|tence of the intere&s;t of the &s;tate which they &s;trove to influence or aid, their real de&s;ign was always the aggrandizement of their own, and the humbling of its rival nation.</P>
<P>With this di&s;po&s;ition, it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, when the American revolution commenced, France would be indifferent to &s;o fair an opportu|nity of humbling the pride and power of Britain. Accordingly, as &s;oon as it was &s;een to be no ha&s;ty riot or tran&s;ient in&s;urrection, that would &s;ink under the force of the Briti&s;h government; but was likely
<PB N="20" REF="031694_0020_0FEE77246C362938">to i&s;&s;ue in the complete independence of the United States, the French court took a decided, open, ac|tive, and u&s;eful, part in our favour. The re&s;ent|ment ari&s;ing from the war, and the di&s;putes ari&s;ing out of the treaty of peace, left no inducement for France to increa&s;e our animo&s;ity again&s;t Britain. But no &s;ooner did we endeavour to compo&s;e tho&s;e di&s;putes, by a treaty, both nece&s;&s;ary for us, and harmle&s;s to France, than here, as in other coun|tries, France clamoured again&s;t that treaty; be|cau&s;e it re&s;tored us to a &s;tate of amity with Britain.</P>
<P>I have no de&s;ire to le&s;&s;en that ju&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t the actual and intended injuries of Britain, or that ju&s;t gratitude for the &s;ervices of France, which every American has felt. Nor am I &s;atisfied, that the opinion is altogether correct, that a nation ought to have no pa&s;&s;ions. Re&s;entment and gra|titude are u&s;eful pa&s;&s;ions, planted in man for good purpo&s;es. Re&s;entment of injury ought not to cea&s;e, while redre&s;s is attainable, and not obtained. Nor ought gratitude for benefits to cea&s;e, while retri|bution is practicable, u&s;eful, and not be&s;towed. If Britain be no longer, our enemy, but now di&s;po&s;ed to do us ju&s;tice, ought not our re&s;entment to cea&s;e? If our &s;ervices would be u&s;ele&s;s to France; if fight|ing no longer for her &s;afety, but for her pride, &s;he ought not to claim them; and if, while they could only feed her <HI>pride,</HI> they would hazard our <HI>&s;afety;</HI> ought gratitude to be exerted? It is no longer a
<PB N="21" REF="031694_0021_0FEE772AA0F51E58">que&s;tion, whether the nations of Europe will ac|knowledge France as a republic. The combined armies no longer take her towns, or occupy her ter|ritory. In&s;tead of defending her own, &s;he now overruns other countries; and continues the war to enlarge her boundaries. Britain her mo&s;t danger|ous enemy has already &s;ent to her capital, to &s;ue for peace. And France may, whenever &s;he plea&s;es have the con&s;ent of all her enemies, to &s;heathe her &s;word, di&s;band her armies, and, under her repub|lican con&s;titution, retain all that va&s;t empire, which her king governed. In this &s;ituation of France, and when we have omitted no &s;ervice, which with|out inju&s;tice or ruin to our&s;elves, we could be&s;tow; &s;hall our gratitude be &s;ummoned to &s;ervices u&s;ele&s;s to her, and dangerous to us? And &s;hall it be called ingratitude, without war, to have compo&s;ed our di&s;putes with Britain, by a treaty, which has &s;e|cured to us points e&s;&s;ential to our &s;afety, and con|tains no &s;tipulation injurious to France? Though gratitude be a duty, both of &s;tates and individuals; the fir&s;t duty, both of &s;tates and individuals, is &s;elf pre&s;ervation. States, like individuals, may often cover their conduct with pretences of genero&s;ity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s; but it will be found generally, that <HI>&s;elf</HI> is at the bottom. Nor do we but in romance, &s;ee Don Quixotes, who gratuitou&s;ly labour through the world, to redre&s;s grievances. Among nations as among individuals, where there is no common in|tere&s;t, there will be but little common &s;ervice. And,
<PB N="22" REF="031694_0022_0FEE776AE860BB20">in both, a prudent man will always &s;u&s;pect &s;trained profe&s;&s;ions of genero&s;ity, for &s;ymptoms of deceit.</P>
<P>To a prudent jealou&s;y of other governments we ought to unite a prudent confidence in our own. Here the tie of common intere&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. With a con&s;titution re&s;training all the branches of the admi|ni&s;tration, and with frequent elections, what have we to fear from our government? Where there is no room for fear, there is no cau&s;e for jealou&s;y; and confidence becomes a duty, which we owe to our own happine&s;s and intere&s;t. A deci&s;ive, firm, and energetic execution of the laws, is the health of a free government; and, to &s;ecure that, the hands of government mu&s;t be &s;trengthened, by a ju&s;t con|fidence. Where there is an influential repre&s;entation of the people, violations of the con&s;titution are, at lea&s;t, not le&s;s to be feared from the legi&s;lature, than from the executive. The mo&s;t popular branch is always the greate&s;t favourite; and favourites are always the mo&s;t apt to abu&s;e power. The &s;enate of Sweden determined, that they might &s;upply the want of the king's &s;ignature by affixing a &s;tamp of his name; in other words, that though he governed in form, they &s;hould govern in reality. The hou&s;e of Commons in England rai&s;ed troops, in the king's name, to &s;ight again&s;t him; and, as &s;oon as they found that they could govern without him, they laid him a&s;ide, and, after him, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed al&s;o the hou&s;e of Lords, and took all government into their own hands.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="031694_0023_0FEE772F3697A5A0">
But have not other nations lo&s;t their freedom, by u&s;urpation of the executive?</P>
<P>Precedent or example becomes argument, only when ca&s;es are &s;imilar: and a variety of circum|&s;tances contributed to de&s;poti&s;m in Europe, which do not exi&s;t here. There, the king was con&s;idered as owner of the whole territory; and all e&s;tates were derived from him. He had a &s;eparate e&s;tate annexed to his per&s;on, exten&s;ive domains, and large revenue. All e&s;tates, that had no heirs, e&s;cheated to him. All, that were forfeited for crimes, ve&s;ted in him. All penalties and forfeitures for offences were his. For the u&s;e of all the&s;e, he was not ac|countable. He commanded the whole force of the kingdom. He could rai&s;e and maintain armies of his own will, and direct them at his plea&s;ure. The admini&s;tration of this revenue, and command of this force, combined with the turbulence and rival&s;hip of feudal ari&s;tocracy, enabled the king to increa&s;e his authority at his di&s;cretion. This accumulation of e&s;tate, trea&s;ure, force, and authority enabled the father to tran&s;mit his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and authorities to his &s;on, and made the crown hereditary; and this both tempted and enabled to render it de&s;potic. While all were accountable to the king; his mini|&s;ters only were re&s;pon&s;ible, and he was &s;ubject to no juri&s;diction. The &s;ituation of our executive is &s;o entire|ly different from all this; that the jealou&s;y nece&s;&s;ary in other government, is not nece&s;&s;ary in ours; nor does it &s;eem to me proper to believe, that party
<PB N="24" REF="031694_0024_0FEE772159BEE588">&s;pirit contributes to the pre&s;ervation of our li|berties.</P>
<P>Let each of us look into his own heart, and cha|ritably believe, that the virtues which he &s;ees in him&s;elf exi&s;t al&s;o in others. Let us not &s;uppo&s;e, that patrioti&s;m is confined to our&s;elves, to our friends, or to our party; or that other opinions and mea&s;ures than ours, may not al&s;o be intended and adapted for the public good. Let us judge of men in public &s;tations, as men; with the errors in|deed, but al&s;o with virtues of men, and examine their conduct with that indulgence to their weakne&s;s, and that re&s;pect for their integrity, which we owe to men, and as men expect to receive. Let us in&s;truct, and, if po&s;&s;ible, reform, but not hate each other. Having all a common intere&s;t in the pro&s;perity of the &s;tate, let us, as members of one family, work to|gether, in unity and affection, for the public good, and di&s;charge our political duties, with fidelity and judgment. In electing to office, let us be careful to choo&s;e men of knowledge, under&s;tanding, and inte|grity; and then repo&s;ing, with confidence, in the ex|cellence of our con&s;titution, and the &s;kill and hone&s;ty of the admini&s;tration; let us not di&s;turb our peace, with groundle&s;s jealou&s;y, or weaken the energy of the laws, by ra&s;h cen&s;ures, and erring complaints. And, with this &s;pirit of faithfulne&s;s and reciprocal confidence, let us proceed to the peculiar duties of our &s;everal &s;tations, at this time.</P>
