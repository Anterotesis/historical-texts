<P>THE eternal Jehovah ruleth in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can &s;tay his hand, or may &s;ay unto him, What do&s;t thou? But his government of his church, hath ever been di&s;tinct from his general government of the world. And from his calling I&s;rael out of Egypt, unto the building of his temple by Solomon, their nation was a growing church, di&s;tinct from all other na|tions upon earth. But becau&s;e Solomon &s;et up high places for idolatry, God rent away ten tribes from his &s;on; and both kingdoms were followed with warnings and corrections, until they were all de&s;troyed or carried into captivity. And the king|dom of I&s;rael never returned from captivity as a nation, but only as individuals; and the kingdom of Judah was always tributary to heathen na|tions, until Chri&s;t came, exactly according to the voices of the prophets concerning him. Yet when he came, the teachers and rulers of the Jews were
<PB N="6" REF="024061_0005_0FC2FCFA30334F48">all again&s;t him; and after he had clean&s;ed ten lepers, and one of them had glorified God there|for, the Phari&s;ees demanded of him, when the kingdom of God &s;hould come? He an&s;wered them and &s;aid, The kingdom of God cometh not with ob&s;ervation. Neither &s;hall they &s;ay, Lo here, or lo there; for behold, the kingdom of God is with|in you.</P>
<P>The Son of God was born <HI>within</HI> that church, of the &s;eed of David, in the town of Bethlehem, according to the prophecy which &s;ays, <HI>This man &s;hall be the peace.</HI> Micah v. 1&mdash;5. And when he entered upon his public mini&s;try, and appeared in Galilee, the people who &s;at in darkne&s;s, <HI>&s;aw great light.</HI> I&s;aiah ix. 1&mdash;6. Mat. iv. 14&mdash;16. Yet many in our day have imagined, that our text proves, that there is a <HI>light within every man,</HI> &s;u|perior to the holy &s;criptures. In the year 1773, a paper was printed at Providence, and al&s;o at Norwich, which repre&s;ented the doctrine of God's electing a certain number of the children of men to holine&s;s and eternal happine&s;s, while the re&s;t are left to peri&s;h in their &s;ins, to be as cruel as the heathen, "who <HI>&s;acrificed their &s;ons and daughters unto devils.</HI>" And the paper clo&s;ed with &s;aying, "Reader, from this, and many other hurtful er|rors, you would &s;oon be di&s;entangled, could you only &s;hake off the chains of <HI>tradition.</HI> The uni|ver&s;al cry of, <HI>Lo here, or lo there,</HI> in this or that outward communion, would never engage you in any fierce contentions, but rather pa&s;s away unno|ticed by you. And the only po&s;&s;ible way, (believe it, or not) to avoid every prevailing error, and of finding every &s;aving truth, is to li&s;ten, &s;olemnly, attentively to li&s;ten, agreeable to the written word, <HI>to the &s;till &s;mall voice within you.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="024061_0006_0FC2FD041117FDE8">
This paper was publi&s;hed, and was &s;pread through New-England, by mini&s;ters who were &s;ent from Great-Britain, to propagate Epi&s;copacy in our land. And after their nation had <HI>murdered</HI> many thou|&s;ands, in attempting to bind us in all ca&s;es what|&s;oever, the <HI>voice within them,</HI> con&s;trained them to make peace with America, to avoid ruin to them|&s;elves. Yet in the clo&s;e of the war, a book from England was reprinted at Philadelphia, which &s;ays, "If God di&s;po&s;eth the &s;tate of events in &s;uch a manner, that &s;in will mo&s;t certainly follow, and that he al&s;o permits, or doth not hinder it, he mu&s;t be the &s;ole <HI>Author</HI> of &s;in him&s;elf, and tho&s;e who are called the actors, or committers of evil, are only <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> by whom he effects it:"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phipps again&s;t Newton, 1783, p. 95.</NOTE> And the author, who gives this a&s;&s;ertion, refers us to Bar|clay, who &s;aid, "The kingdom of God cometh not with ob&s;ervation, neither &s;hall they &s;ay, <HI>Lo here, or lo there,</HI> for behold the kingdom of God <HI>is with|in you."</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 205.</NOTE> And &s;ays his defender, "The <HI>Quakers</HI> neither read the &s;criptures, nor any thing el&s;e, du|ring the time of their wor&s;hip, as a part of it; but after that is over, they u&s;ually once in the year, take the opportunity, before the congregation &s;e|parate, to read tho&s;e &s;hort informations and advices which are tran&s;mitted from the yearly-meeting in London. The&s;e advices always con&s;i&s;t of &s;crip|ture-quotations, and doctrines agreeable to &s;crip|ture, according to the be&s;t of their knowledge; but the reading of them is no more a part of their wor&s;hip, than the reading te&s;timonies of denial again&s;t immoral members, or the &s;ub&s;tance of briefs recommended by the Crown, at &s;uch op|portunities." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 153.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="024061_0007_0FC2FD05797C8998">
Thus Epi&s;copalians and Quakers were agreed, in &s;itting up a rule within them&s;elves above the word of God. Yea, many of them will not allow the holy &s;criptures to be the word of God. But Je&s;us &s;aid, I am come a <HI>light</HI> into the world, that who&s;oever believeth on me, &s;hould not abide in darkne&s;s. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to &s;ave the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not <HI>my words,</HI> hath one that judgeth him: the <HI>word</HI> that I have &s;poken, the &s;ame &s;hall judge him in the la&s;t day. John xii. 46&mdash;48. His <HI>words</HI> and his <HI>word</HI> are the &s;ame, even the will of God revealed by his Spirit. And an in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ays, "We are not as many, who <HI>corrupt the word of God;</HI> but as of <HI>&s;incerity,</HI> but as of God, in the &s;ight of God &s;peak we in Chri&s;t.&mdash;We have renounced the hidden things of <HI>di&s;hone&s;ty,</HI> not walking in <HI>cra&s;tine&s;s,</HI> nor handling <HI>the word of God deceitfully,</HI> but by <HI>manife&s;tation of the truth,</HI> commending our&s;elves to every man's <HI>con&s;cience</HI> in the &s;ight of God. 2 Cor. ii. 17. iv. 2. The body of Je&s;us &s;aw no corruption, even when it lay in the tomb; therefore the holy &s;criptures are the only word of God that men can corrupt; and they do it, by handling the word deceitfully. And were it not for this wickedne&s;s, the kingdom of God would be ea&s;ily under&s;tood, and rejoiced in, under every view of it in his word.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, it means the proclamation of the go&s;pel to a &s;inful world. Therefore the Me&s;|&s;enger who came to prepare the way of the Son of God, &s;aid to the Jews, Repent ye; for the king|dom of heaven is at hand. Mat. iii. 2. And after Je&s;us was baptized, and had endured the tempta|tions of the devil, he came into Galilee, preaching
<PB N="9" REF="024061_0008_0FC2FD0E1B202B08">the go&s;pel of the kingdom of God, and &s;aying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: Repent ye and believe the go&s;pel. And after his death and re&s;urrection, he appeared unto the <HI>eleven,</HI> and &s;aid unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not, &s;hall be damned. Mark i. 14, 15. xvi. 15, 16. This commi&s;&s;ion was given to the <HI>eleven,</HI> who were all born again. In the covenant of circumci&s;ion, the regenerate and unre|generate were bound together in a national church. Therefore when Chri&s;t &s;ent out the <HI>twelve,</HI> he &s;aid, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not. But go rather to the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and as ye go, preach, &s;aying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Judas the <HI>traitor</HI> was included in this com|mi&s;&s;ion. Mat. x. 1.&mdash;7. But after Chri&s;t by his death had di&s;annulled the covenant of circum|ci&s;ion, he gave the pure go&s;pel commi&s;&s;ion to none but regenerate per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> &s;en&s;e in which the kingdom of God is taken in his word, is the change of heart which is produced thereby. When the Son of God, the great <HI>light of the world,</HI> came to his own people, they received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of God, even to them that believed on his name; who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God. And Je&s;us &s;aid, Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God. John i. 12, 13. iii. 3. But men have been &s;o far from believing him, that they have gen|erally held to the bringing of per&s;ons into the
<PB N="10" REF="024061_0009_0FC2FD0F63B75F20">kingdom of God by blood, by their own wills, or by the wills of other men; and from thence have come all national churches. But God &s;ays, Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&mdash;Him that is weak in the &s;aith receive you, but not to doubtful di&s;putations.&mdash;For the king|dom of God is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. Rom. x. 17. xiv. 1, 17. But men have commonly re|ceived per&s;ons into the church, without any evi|dence of their being <HI>in the &s;aith;</HI> and they have pur&s;ued all with <HI>doubtful di&s;putations,</HI> who have refu&s;ed to obey man in the things of God. He requires each one to act &s;aithfully and kindly in every &s;tation of life, as they can an&s;wer it to their great Judge. And he &s;ays, If any man each other|wi&s;e, and con&s;ent not to whol&s;om <HI>words,</HI> even the <HI>words</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to the doctrine which is according to <HI>godline&s;s;</HI> he is proud, know|ing nothing, but doting about que&s;tions and &s;tri&s;es of words, whereof cometh envy, &s;tri&s;e, railings, evil &s;urmi&s;ings, <HI>perver&s;e di&s;putings</HI> of men of cor|rupt minds, and de&s;titute of the <HI>truth,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>gain is godline&s;s:</HI> from &s;uch withdraw thy&s;elf. Yet, becau&s;e <HI>godline&s;s</HI> and <HI>bone&s;ty,</HI> are connected with prayer for civil rulers, many have imagined that they ought to &s;upport religious teachers by <HI>force.</HI> Whereas this practice came from <HI>&s;educing &s;pirits, and doctrines of devils.</HI> But <HI>godline&s;s</HI> is profitable unto all things, having promi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 1 Tim. ii. 2. iv. 1&mdash;8. vi. 1&mdash;5. And, to guard again&s;t anxiety about food and raiment, our Lord &s;ays, Seek fir&s;t the kingdom of God, and his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and all the&s;e things &s;hall be added unto you. Mat. vi. 33. How much then are all men
<PB N="11" REF="024061_0010_0FC2FD10B88BAD70">deceived, who u&s;e &s;ecular force to &s;upport religious teachers? In them the prophecy is fulfilled, which &s;ays, All ye bea&s;ts of the field, come to devour, yea, all the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t. His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; &s;leeping, lying down, loving to &s;lumber. Yea, they are <HI>greedy dogs,</HI> which can <HI>never have enough,</HI> and they are &s;hep|herds that cannot under&s;tand: they all look to their <HI>own way,</HI> every one for his <HI>gain</HI> from his quarter. I&s;aiah lvi. 9&mdash;12. What a hand have &s;uch teachers had in all the wars among the nations?</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> &s;en&s;e of the kingdom of God, is his government of his vi&s;ible church. Our Lord &s;aid, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my &s;ervants fight, that I &s;hould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence. Pilate there|fore &s;aid unto him, Art thou a king then? Je&s;us an&s;wered, Thou &s;ay&s;t that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cau&s;e came I into the world, that I &s;hould bear witne&s;s unto the <HI>truth.</HI> Every one that is of the <HI>truth,</HI> heareth my voice. John xviii. 36, 37. Fighting with the <HI>&s;word,</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary in the government of this world; and &s;ubjection thereto ought to be a matter of <HI>con&s;cience</HI> with every &s;oul. Rom. xiii. 1&mdash;5. But the gov|ernment of the church &s;hould be as di&s;tinct from all worldly &s;tates, as the power of <HI>truth</HI> on the mind, is from the <HI>&s;word</HI> on the body. For Je&s;us &s;aid to the <HI>eleven,</HI> All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth: Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t; teaching them to ob&s;erve all things, what&s;oever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you
<PB N="12" REF="024061_0011_0FC2FD1A7011E498">alway even unto the end of the world. Amen. Mat. xxviii. 16&mdash;20. It was before ob&s;erved, that this commi&s;&s;ion was given to the <HI>eleven,</HI> without any <HI>traitor</HI> among them. But God &s;ays, In the la&s;t days perilous times &s;hall come; for men &s;hall be lovers of their own&s;elves, covetous, boa&s;ters, proud, bla&s;phemers, di&s;obedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, fal&s;e accu&s;ers, incontinent, fierce, de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are good, <HI>traitors,</HI> heady, highminded, lovers of plea&s;ures more than lovers of God; having a form of godline&s;s, but denying the power thereof: from &s;uch turn away. 2 Tim. iii. 1&mdash;5. Language cannot de&s;cribe our times more exactly, than was thus done by in&s;piration above &s;eventeen hundred years ago. And a great means of the&s;e evils, hath been the u&s;e of the &s;word in religious affairs, con|trary to the command of Chri&s;t, who &s;ays,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man who &s;owed good &s;eed in his field; but while men &s;lept, his enemy came and &s;owed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was &s;prung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares al&s;o. So the &s;ervants of the hou&s;holder came and &s;aid unto him, Sir, did&s;t thou not &s;ow good &s;eed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He &s;aid unto them, An enemy hath done this. The &s;ervants &s;aid unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he &s;aid, Nay; le&s;t while ye gather up the tares, ye root up al&s;o the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harve&s;t; and in the time of har|ve&s;t I will &s;ay to the reapers, Gather ye together fir&s;t the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.&mdash;He that &s;oweth the good &s;eed is the Son of man: the
<PB N="13" REF="024061_0012_0FC2FD1BF46A59A8">field is the world: the good &s;eed are the children of the kingdom: but the tares are the children of the wicked one: the enemy that &s;owed them, is the devil; the harve&s;t is the end of the world, and the reapers are the angels. Mat. xiii. 24&mdash;30, 37&mdash;39. Accordingly he &s;aid unto hypocrites in the Jewi&s;h church, Ye are of your father the <HI>devil,</HI> and the lu&s;ts of your father ye will do: he was a <HI>murderer</HI> from the beginning, and abode not <HI>in the truth,</HI> becau&s;e there is no <HI>truth</HI> in him. When he &s;peaketh a <HI>lie,</HI> he &s;peaketh of his own; for he is a <HI>liar,</HI> and the <HI>father of it.</HI> John viii. 44. And it is impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t to root up all hypocrites out of the world, without de&s;troying the &s;aints with them. Yea, and the u&s;e of the &s;word in religious affairs; arms the enemies of God again&s;t his children, as the experience of all ages hath demon&s;trated. But,</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> the kingdom of God, means his coming in the la&s;t day, to judge the world in righteou&s;|ne&s;s; when the wicked &s;hall go away into ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment, and the righteous be received into life eternal. Therefore Je&s;us &s;ays unto his di&s;ciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s, and follow me. For who&s;oever will &s;ave his life, &s;hall lo&s;e it: and who&s;oever will lo&s;e his life for my &s;ake, &s;hall find it. For what is a man profited, if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul? or what &s;hall a man give in exchange for his &s;oul? For the Son of man &s;hall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then &s;hall he reward every man according to his works. Mat. xvi. 24&mdash;27. Ve|rily verily I &s;ay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear &s;hall live. For
<PB N="14" REF="024061_0013_0FC2FD296236E940">as the Father hath life in him&s;elf, &s;o hath he given to the Son to have life in him&s;elf; and hath given him authority to execute judgment al&s;o, becau&s;e he is the Son of man. Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves &s;hall hear his voice, and &s;hall come forth, they that have done good, unto the re&s;urrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the re&s;|urrection of damnation. John v. 25&mdash;29.</P>
<P>And the&s;e five &s;en&s;es are perfectly harmonious. For the proclamation of the go&s;pel, believed with the heart, and obeyed in the church, without in|juring any man in the world, as each one can an|&s;wer it to God in the la&s;t day, is a glorious kingdom which cannot be moved. And if the church of Chri&s;t was governed wholly by his laws, enforced in his name, &s;he would be an infinite ble&s;&s;ing to human &s;ociety. For ju&s;tice, mercy, and faithful|ne&s;s, are the effence of all the revealed will of God. And he &s;aid of Abraham, I know him, that he will command his children and his hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the way of the Lord, to do ju&s;tice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath &s;poken of him. Gen. xviii. 19. Ju&s;tice and judgment, is the only way to enjoy the promi&s;ed mercy of God to &s;inful men. Only a <HI>remnant</HI> of the children of I&s;rael, were &s;aved by the Son of God, who&s;e goings forth have been from of old, from everla&s;ting. And when they enquired about the way of acceptance with him, he &s;aid, He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, what is <HI>good;</HI> and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? Micah v. 1&mdash;5. vi. 8. And when one &s;aid to Je&s;us, <HI>Good</HI> ma&s;ter, what good thing &s;hall I do that I may have eternal life?
<PB N="15" REF="024061_0014_0FC2FD2AA8FB9F78">Je&s;us &s;aid, Why calle&s;t thou me good? there is none good but one, that is <HI>God.</HI> And when he parted with Je&s;us, rather than to part with his riches, in acts of mercy, Je&s;us &s;aid, It is ea&s;ier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When the di&s;ciples heard it, they were exceeding|ly amazed, &s;aying, Who then can be &s;aved? But Je&s;us beheld them, and &s;aid unto them, With men this is impo&s;&s;ible, but with God all things are po&s;|&s;ible. Mat. xix. 16&mdash;26.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible with men, to convince any &s;oul that Je&s;us is truly <HI>God,</HI> and that all <HI>good,</HI> for time and eternity, is only to be enjoyed by &s;aith in his <HI>perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and obedience to his <HI>holy word.</HI> But the Spirit of God convinced three thou&s;and &s;ouls hereof in <HI>one day;</HI> and to them it was &s;aid, The <HI>promi&s;e</HI> is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, <HI>even as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call.&mdash;Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized.</HI> Acts ii. 37&mdash;41. Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> of the law, being made a <HI>cur&s;e</HI> for us&mdash;that the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that we might receive the <HI>promi&s;e of the Spirit through faith.</HI> And they who think to receive it in any other way, are <HI>bewitched.</HI> Gal. iii. 1&mdash;14. For by thy <HI>&s;orceries</HI> were all nations <HI>deceived.</HI> Rev. xviii. 23. If men were not <HI>deceived,</HI> they would never claim the promi&s;es of God, in a way of di&s;|obedience to his precepts. And as the church is pre&s;ented as a <HI>cha&s;te virgin to Chri&s;t,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for any men to have a <HI>commanding</HI> power there|in.

Ezek. xxxiv. 4&mdash;25. Prote&s;tants have exerci&s;ed all the power of the fir&s;t bea&s;t at Rome, and have carried blood and &s;lavery around the world, in galleys and gallant &s;hips.

I&s;aiah xxxiii. 20&mdash;22. xlvii. 10&mdash;15. Rev. xviii. 23. The rea&s;on why piety, religion, and mo|rality, are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the good order of human &s;ociety, is becau&s;e they are as much above the <HI>commanding</HI> power of man, as the &s;howers and &s;hines of heaven are. Therefore Mo&s;es &s;ays, My doctrine &s;hall drop as the rain, my &s;peech &s;hall di&s;till as the dew, as the &s;mall rain upon the tender herb, and as the &s;howers upon the gra&s;s. Becau&s;e I will publi&s;h the name of the Lord: a&s;cribe ye greatne&s;s unto our God.

Deut. xxxii. 2&mdash;4, 15, 35. From whence an in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ays, Dearly be|loved, avenge not your&s;elves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, &s;aith the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thir&s;t, give him drink: for in &s;o doing thou &s;halt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but over|come evil with good. Rom. xii. 19&mdash;21. Let us hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of our faith without waver|ing; (for he is faithful that promi&s;ed) and let us con&s;ider one another, to provoke unto love, and to good works; not for&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling of our|&s;elves together, as the manner of &s;ome is; but ex|horting one another, and &s;o much the more as ye &s;ee the day approaching. For if we &s;in <HI>wilfully,</HI> after that we have received the knowledge of the <HI>truth,</HI> there remaineth no more &s;acrifice for &s;ins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which &s;hall devour the adver&s;a|ries. He that de&s;pi&s;ed Mo&s;es law died without mercy, under two or three witne&s;&s;es: of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment, &s;uppo&s;e ye, &s;hall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was &s;anctified, an unholy thing, and hath done <HI>de&s;pite unto the Spirit of grace?</HI> For we know him that hath &s;aid, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompen&s;e, &s;aith the Lord. Heb. x. 23&mdash;30.</P>
<P>The body of the Son of God never was trodden under foot; but his holy laws have been, and his blood hath been counted an unholy thing, and great de&s;pite hath been done to the Spirit of grace.
<PB N="18" REF="024061_0017_0FC2FD3872668EB0">The devils believe that there is one God; and they tremble before the Son of God. And all men who profe&s;s faith in Chri&s;t, and do not obey his laws, have only a dead faith. For as the body without the &s;pirit is dead, &s;o faith without works is dead al&s;o. James ii. 19&mdash;26. From whence I conclude, that the killing of God's two witne&s;&s;es, is triumph|ing over the revealed will of God, which u&s;ed to torment the con&s;ciences of men. Rev. xi. 9, 10. But God &s;ays, Behold, the day cometh that &s;hall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly &s;hall be &s;tubble, and the day that cometh &s;hall burn them up, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, that it &s;hall leave them neither root nor branch.

And ye &s;hall tread down the wicked, for they &s;hall be a&s;hes under the &s;oles of your feet, in the day that I &s;hall do this, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts. Mal. iv. 1&mdash;3. And an in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ays, We, according to his promi&s;e, look for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. 2 Peter iii. 13. All which proves that piety, religion, and morality, are as much above the commanding power of men, as the &s;howers of heaven are, or the &s;un in the firmament.</P>
<P>Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and obedience to the re|vealed will of God, INDEPENDENT of the world, is the only way to e&s;cape <HI>everla&s;ting burnings.</HI> For he &s;ays, He that walketh righteou&s;ly, and &s;peaketh uprightly, he that de&s;pi&s;eth the gain of oppre&s;|&s;ions, that &s;haketh his hands from holding of bribes, that &s;toppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and &s;hutteth his eyes from &s;eeing evil; he &s;hall dwell on high, his place of defence &s;hall be

So are the ways of every one that is <HI>greedy of gain;</HI> which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. Prov. i. 14&mdash;19.

<P><HI>Rebellion,</HI> in the old te&s;tament, and <HI>here&s;y,</HI> un|der the go&s;pel, evidently mean the &s;ame thing.
