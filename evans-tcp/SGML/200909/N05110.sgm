<HEAD>A PREFATORY ADDRESS. TO THE <HI>Reverend,</HI> the SYNODS of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Phila|delphia;</HI> and to all the Religious SOCIETIES under their re&s;pective Care and Charge.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Reverend, Honoured, and Beloved</HI> Fathers <HI>and</HI> Brethren!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE divided State of the Pre&s;byterian Churches, in this Part of the World, where divine Providence has ca&s;t our Lot, has opened a melancholy Pro&s;pect to my View for &s;ome con&s;iderable Space of Time! Which I did not think proper to communicate to others for a Sea&s;on; not knowing what were the Sentiments of my <HI>Brethren</HI> upon either Side of the Que&s;tion, becau&s;e I thought, however expedient, honourable and advantageous to the Redeemer's Kingdom, a <HI>Re|union</HI> might be, yet it was not practicable, unle&s;s the <HI>Body</HI> of both SYNODS was inclin'd thereto.</P>
<P>BUT hearing of a Number of both SYNODS more de&s;irous of Peace and Union of late, and being excited by &s;ome Reverend Members of the <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>New-York,</HI> and one of the <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to move in this Affair: I did at the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of the Synod of <HI>New-York,</HI> in pur&s;uance of my own Judgement and Inclination, and in compliance with the afore&s;aid Excitements, to|gether with &s;ome of my <HI>Brethren,</HI> make a <HI>Motion</HI> to the <HI>Synod,</HI> for <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union,</HI> which after &s;ome Rea&s;oning upon the Head, was comply'd with, and Me&s;&s;engers appointed to make <HI>Overtures</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> of both Synods into one, which was done accordingly, and are now under Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>AND being inform'd, that the Propo&s;als of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union,</HI> occa&s;ioned &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s in &s;everal Societies, I thought it my Duty, to endeavour to remove the Grounds thereof, and promote the glorious and truly evangelical De&s;ign of <HI>Peace,</HI> as well as I
<PB N="iv" REF="006423_0003_1028DE488D449B40">
could, by committing my Thoughts on that Subject to Writing, and expo&s;ing them to publick View!</P>
<P>MY Motives to endeavour in earne&s;t to promote Peace and Union are the&s;e,</P>
<P>NOT a Change of <HI>Sentiment,</HI> about the late Revival of Religion, No! I do now declare &s;olemnly before the World, that I have &s;een no Cau&s;e to alter my <HI>Opinion</HI> in Relation to it, and therefore I do now <HI>believe</HI> its Reality, as much as formerly; and if after this open and expre&s;s Declaration, any will unju&s;tly Cen&s;ure me with the Contrary, perhaps becau&s;e I cannot be &s;o narrow as them|&s;elves, I &s;hall take no farther Notice of it, than to pity their un|rea&s;onable Prejudice, and appeal from their unrighteous Judge|ment, to a higher and more impartial Tribunal; to a God that knows all the Thoughts and De&s;igns of Men!</P>
<P>I cannot come into a <HI>Union</HI> with any <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> whereto Acknowledgements contradictory to what I have now declared, are required, as <HI>Terms</HI> of <HI>Communion:</HI> No! I would rather chu&s;e a <HI>Pri&s;on,</HI> or any kind of <HI>Sufferings:</HI> Nor is what I have &s;aid in the following <HI>Treati&s;e,</HI> concerning the <HI>Matters of doubtful Specu|lation,</HI> in the lea&s;t Degree incon&s;i&s;tent herewith; becau&s;e tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions do not re&s;pect the <HI>Nature, Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> or <HI>Value</HI> of a Work of <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> in general, or its Reality and Certainty con|&s;idered in it&s;elf; but only the Uncertainty of the <HI>Appearances</HI> of &s;uch a <HI>Work</HI> in others, to us; or the Uncertainty of our <HI>Judge|ment</HI> concerning them.</P>
<P>NOW between tho&s;e two Things, the <HI>Difference</HI> is as wide as between <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> between divine <HI>Revelation</HI> and human <HI>Conjecture;</HI> if there be any who cannot perceive the <HI>Difference,</HI> they are to be pitied as Objects of Compa&s;&s;ion, as <HI>Non Compos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">!</HI> And if they do perceive it, and will not acknowledge it, they di&s;|cover by their Want of <HI>Candour,</HI> a bad <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> which needs &s;uch in&s;incere &s;ophi&s;tical <HI>Arts</HI> to &s;upport it; and de&s;erve <HI>Reproof:</HI> Such I would acco&s;t in the Language of <HI>Job</HI> to <HI>Zophar, Will you &s;peak wickedly for GOD, and talk deceitfully for him?</HI></P>
<P>TO cry up the <HI>Certainty</HI> of our <HI>Opinion,</HI> about any In&s;tances of <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> in others in our Day, &s;o as to make it a <HI>Badge</HI> of <HI>Di&s;tinction,</HI> between, or Engine of <HI>Divi&s;ion</HI> among the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, is (in its direct Tendency) to abu&s;e GOD'S <HI>Work</HI> to the Di&s;honour of his Name, and the <HI>Injury</HI> of his <HI>Kingdom,</HI> in|&s;tead of exalting GOD it is to exalt our &s;elves and our Opinion, (tho' probably the Honour of GOD is &s;eriou&s;ly intended,) which is always (re&s;pecting &s;uch <HI>&s;ecret Matters) precarious</HI> and often <HI>partial.</HI></P>
<P>THO' I value the late <HI>Work</HI> of GOD highly, yet in the mean Time, I think it is &s;inful to make my Opinion of it. a <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Communion</HI> to others; for tho' I am as fully per&s;uaded as ever of its Reality, yet in the mean Time, I believe that my Opinion, and the Opinion of all others about &s;uch Matters, is fallible and un|certain: Nor can I &s;ee in the &s;acred Scriptures, any Warrant for impo&s;ing my <HI>Opinion,</HI> or the Opinion of others, re&s;pecting the <HI>in|vi&s;ible

Grace</HI> of GOD in particular Per&s;ons, as a <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Commu|nion,</HI> either Mini&s;terial or Chri&s;tian</P>
<P>NOR have I been Moved to this Important <HI>Enterprize,</HI> by any Thing that concerns my&s;elf, either by <HI>Grief</HI> for any &s;uppos'd <HI>Mi&s;conduct</HI> of Mine, in Time pa&s;t, or any <HI>Expectation</HI> of <HI>Credit, Comfort</HI> or <HI>Benefit,</HI> that may re&s;ult from &s;uch a <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> in Time to come, &s;o far as they Re&s;pect me!</P>
<P>BUT <HI>MEERLY</HI> by the Con&s;ideration, of the po&s;itive Command of GOD, to <HI>pray for the Peace of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to <HI>pur&s;ue Peace,</HI> and <HI>to keep the Unity of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace.</HI></P>
<P>TOGETHER with a Pro&s;pect of the <HI>Honour</HI> that I conceive will redound to GOD'S <HI>Name</HI> as well as Manifold <HI>Benefits, Credit,</HI> and <HI>Comfort</HI> to the Societies of our Denomination, for a long Time to come, in Ca&s;e &s;uch a Re-union be obtained, upon a Scriptural Foundation: Generations yet unborn, are like to reap valuable Advantages by it, and prai&s;e GOD, for it with joy|ful Lips! I have been likewi&s;e encourag'd in this, by con&s;ider|ing calmly, and as impartially as I could, the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Con|trover&s;y,</HI> that has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among us, which appears to me, to be only about <HI>Circum&s;tantials!</HI></P>
<P>PERMIT me, my <HI>Reverend Fathers</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI> in all <HI>humi|lity,</HI> and with due <HI>deference</HI> to the <HI>Judgment</HI> of others, to expre&s;s my <HI>Sentiments,</HI> upon this <HI>Head,</HI> with a peaceful Intention.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me, that thro' the <HI>heat</HI> of <HI>Debate,</HI> the principal <HI>Matters</HI> Controverted, were either not &s;o very clearly and di&s;|tinctly <HI>apprehended,</HI> or not &s;o &s;ufficiently and happily <HI>attended to,</HI> by the <HI>Parties</HI> in Controver&s;ey, as could be <HI>wi&s;hed!</HI></P>
<P>FOR as upon one Hand the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> to GOD, as is repre&s;ented in the <HI>Scriptures</HI> of Truth, and in our <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> according to them, was acknowledg'd, and only the <HI>Opinion</HI> of &s;ome concerning the <HI>Reality,</HI> or Number of &s;ome late <HI>in&s;tances</HI> of <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> (or re&s;pecting both together) di&s;puted, and contradicted.</P>
<P>SO upon the other Hand, the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of CHRIST, as they are repre&s;ented in the Holy <HI>Scripture,</HI> and in our <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> according to them, were al&s;o Acknowledged, and only &s;ome prudential <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Rules,</HI> not expre&s;s'd in the &s;acred <HI>Scriptures,</HI> or our <HI>Directory,</HI> for Wor&s;hip and Government, di&s;puted and oppos'd.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of the Points di&s;puted were freely acknow|ledg'd by the <HI>Reverend Brethren</HI> upon both Sides of the Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> to GOD as it is held forth in the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and in our <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> and the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Church Di&s;cipline,</HI> (in all e&s;&s;entials) as re|pre&s;ented in the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> and in our <HI>Directory;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>Controver&s;ey</HI> in my Apprehen&s;ion, turns entirely upon <HI>Circum&s;tan|tials.</HI> And any <HI>Action</HI> that was Mutually complain'd of, was grounded upon, and i&s;&s;u'd from a Difference of <HI>Opinion,</HI> about
<PB N="vi" REF="006423_0005_1028DE4DD7B5D300">
the Circum&s;tantials afore&s;aid, or as the in&s;pir'd Apo&s;tle phra&s;es them, Matters of <HI>doubtful Di&s;putation!</HI></P>
<P>NOW as it appears to me, that the <HI>Matters controverted</HI> were <HI>Circum&s;tantial,</HI> &s;o I cannot but believe, that the <HI>Reverend Brethren</HI> upon both Sides of the Que&s;tion, had &s;incere and good <HI>de&s;igns,</HI> in the different Parts they bore in the late <HI>Controver&s;y:</HI> While &s;ome were earne&s;tly contending, for the Credit of the late extraordinary Religious <HI>appearances,</HI> with <HI>de&s;ign</HI> that they might &s;pread far and wide! Others were &s;treneou&s;ly Contending, for the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Go|vernment</HI> of CHRIST'S <HI>Kingdom,</HI> lea&s;t they &s;hould Suffer, and be quite unhing'd, in that uncommon <HI>&s;ituation</HI> of, and <HI>ferment</HI> that obtain'd among the <HI>Churches!</HI></P>
<P>BUT tho' the Things controverted, con&s;ider'd calmly and in a true di&s;tinct Light, were &s;mall; yet the Heat of <HI>Debate</HI> about them, run very high; this together with evil Surmi&s;ings, &s;evere Cen&s;urings, and ra&s;h Judgings of each other, encourag'd and en|flam'd, by <HI>Mi&s;repre&s;entations,</HI> carried to and fro, by the unwearied Indu&s;try of <HI>Tale-bearers</HI> and <HI>Tatlers,</HI> who are generally bu&s;y on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, encreas'd mutual Prejudices and Su&s;picions, to a Melancholy <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> and &s;o occa&s;ioned the unhappy <HI>Rupture</HI> of the <HI>Churches Union,</HI> which has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among Us for &s;ome Years!</P>
<P>REVEREND <HI>Fathers,</HI> and <HI>Dear Brethren,</HI> the earne&s;t de&s;ire of my <HI>Heart</HI> after <HI>Peac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> of the <HI>Churches</HI> in this Part of the World, has induced me to Compo&s;e the following Sheets, <HI>(fe&s;tinante calamo)</HI> &s;omewhat ha&s;tily, and humbly to offer them to your <HI>Con&s;ideration,</HI> as well as to &s;ubmit them to your <HI>Correction.</HI></P>
<P>I can hone&s;tly declare, that I De&s;ign to offend no one, of either Side of the Que&s;tion; but to <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> the compromi&s;ing of the Matters of Difference, and promote Peace and Union in the be&s;t Manner I can!</P>
<P>I tru&s;t my <HI>Brethren,</HI> that you will candidly interpret, and kind|ly accept, this humble <HI>Attempt,</HI> for the Peace of <HI>Jeru&s;alem!</HI></P>
<P>IF there be any <HI>Pa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ges</HI> in the following Performance, not &s;uitably expre&s;s'd, I hope your <HI>Candour</HI> will &s;ugge&s;t this in my excu&s;e, that the <HI>Province,</HI> which I have thro' a <HI>Zeal</HI> for GOD, and not any Notion of my own <HI>Capacity,</HI> ventur'd upon, is ex|ceeding Difficult: It is hard to &s;ay any Thing, clo&s;ely upon a Point in Controver&s;ey, without giving Offence to Per&s;ons of one, or both Sides of the Que&s;tion!</P>
<P>SO far as I know, I have not been influenced in the lea&s;t <HI>Degree,</HI> by any regard to my own <HI>Reputation,</HI> or any partial <HI>Bya&s;s</HI> what|&s;oever, in the following <HI>Compo&s;ure,</HI> and if I am mi&s;taken in any <HI>Sentiment</HI> there expre&s;s'd I am willing to be convinced of it by Arguments but not by the per&s;ecuting Methods of Threatnings, and upon Conviction, to alter my Opinion, and acknowledge my Mi&s;take!</P>

<P>WHATEVER may be the i&s;&s;ue of this <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> which I chearfully commit to the <HI>Di&s;po&s;al</HI> of the GOD of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> yet this I mu&s;t declare in the mean Time, that I greatly rejoyce in this Opportunity, I have before I Die, of expre&s;&s;ing the very <HI>Senti|ments</HI> of my <HI>Heart,</HI> upon &s;o Amiable and Important an Occa&s;ion&punc; Were I to go before the great <HI>Judge</HI> of all the Earth To-morrow, I &s;hould be glad to fini&s;h this immediately before it!</P>
<P>NOTHING appears to me, more Beautiful and Glorious, then <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> among the Profe&s;&s;ors of the RELIGI|ON, of the <HI>Meek</HI> and <HI>Humble</HI> JESUS.</P>
<P>AND therefore I am griev'd in my Heart, for the narrow Notions, of &s;ome Pious, and in other re&s;pects valuable Men; who are fondly de&s;iring, or vainly attempting, to promote the <HI>good</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of CHRIST, either by multiplying, or continuing her unhappy, di&s;honourable, and dangerous <HI>Divi&s;ions!</HI></P>
<P>THO' I tru&s;t their <HI>Zeal</HI> is Sincere, and their de&s;igns Pious, for which they de&s;erve E&s;teem, and Commendation; yet as to their <HI>Divi&s;ive</HI> contracted <HI>Mea&s;ures,</HI> I would &s;ay as <HI>Jacob</HI> of <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Levi,</HI> In&s;truments of Cruelty (in&s;tead of Kindne&s;s which they in|intend) are in their Habitation to the poor wounded broken Church of GOD: <HI>O my Soul! come not into their Secret! min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Honour be not thou United!</HI></P>
<P>NO on the contrary! thro' GOD'S a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I will <HI>pray for the Peace of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and <HI>&s;ay, Peace be within thy Walls,</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;perity be within thy Palaces for my Brethren and Companion's Sake, I will &s;ay Peace be within thee; becau&s;e of the Hou&s;e of the LORD our GOD, I will &s;eek thy Good.</HI> I am re&s;olved whatever others &s;ay, or do, to Labour for the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> of <HI>Zion,</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> while I <HI>Live,</HI> and to <HI>Sigh</HI> for it, with my <HI>dying Breath!</HI></P>
<P>TWO Things I would de&s;ire of <HI>Readers</HI> in General, <HI>viz.</HI> That they would dive&s;t them&s;elves of <HI>Prejudice,</HI> if they have any; and give what I offer for Peace, in the Name of my <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> a fair hearing, weighing candidly and impar|tially, with a humble Mind, the <HI>Grounds</HI> thereof, for GOD'S &s;ake, the <HI>Churches</HI> &s;ake, and <HI>their own:</HI> And that they would Remember me, before the <HI>Throne</HI> of Grace, who am the greate&s;t of Sinners, and far le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints, and not worthy of the Character of an <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador</HI> of CHRIST that <HI>I may obtain Mercy of</HI> GOD <HI>to be faithful to the Death.</HI></P>
<P>AND of you particularly my <HI>Reverend Fathers,</HI> and <HI>Dear Brethren,</HI> I earne&s;tly beg a Remembrance in your Prayers; you know Sirs, better than I can expre&s;s, how becoming and glorious it is, for the <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors</HI> of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> to &s;eek <HI>Peace</HI>

If I forget the O</HI> Jeru&s;a|lem, <HI>let my right Hand forget her cunning: Let my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth, if I prefer not</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>to my chief Joy.</HI></P>
<P>BUT tho' the People of God are agreed about the <HI>Object</HI> of their chief Care and Regard, about the <HI>End</HI> they aim at; yet they are &s;ometimes of very different Sentiments as to &s;ome of the <HI>Mea|&s;ures</HI> they concert and pur&s;ue to obtain that valuable End.</P>
<P>THIS Diver&s;ity perhaps is owing to their different natural Tem|pers, different Capacities, different Methods of Education, different Opportunities of Conver&s;ation, different advances in divine Know|ledge and Grace; and it may be in &s;ome In&s;tances owing to the in&s;en&s;ible corrupt <HI>Bya&s;s</HI> of Prejudice.</P>
<P>NOW among the different <HI>Mea&s;ures</HI> which good Men propo&s;e for promoting the afore&s;aid <HI>End,</HI> namely, the <HI>Weal</HI> of God's vi&s;ible Church and Kingdom on Earth, methinks tho&s;e are mo&s;t likely to be &s;erviceable, which have the expre&s;s &s;tamp of divine Authority, and agree with all the other Parts of divine Revelation, for God's <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> is infinitely &s;uperior to Mans, and what comes from him, mu&s;t needs agree with it&s;elf, &s;eeing it proceeds from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, and has the &s;ame De&s;ign.</P>

<P>BUT JERUSALEM had not only excellent ORDER, but like|wi&s;e a firm UNION among its Inhabitants, both which &s;tand and fall together.

Ju&s;t &s;o it is with the vi&s;ible Church or Kingdom of Chri&s;t.

<P>PRAY ob&s;erve, my Brethren, that the great God po&s;itively Commands us to <HI>keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</HI> (Ephe&s;. iv, 3) Every Word of this ble&s;&s;ed Precept is big with <HI>Empha&s;is, (Spudazontes terein, ten enoteta tou pneumatos, en to &s;un|de&s;mo tes eirenes)</HI> The Word tran&s;lated <HI>keep, (&s;pudazontes)</HI> &s;ig|nifies our earne&s;t endeavour to pre&s;erve a Thing with great &s;tudy, &s;olicitude and labour. This Precept is truly Evangelical; the Law requires ab&s;olute Perfection upon pain of Death, but CHRIST urges our inten&s;e and diligent Endeavour after O|bedience.</P>
<P>BUT what is it that we &s;hould keep with &s;o great Care and Pains? Why the UNITY <HI>of the Spirit, (ten enoteta tou pneumatos) the Onene&s;s of the Spirit;</HI> it is that <HI>Onene&s;s</HI> which he had &s;poken of in the &s;econd and third Chapters of this Book, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Body of Chri&s;t,</HI> compos'd of different &s;orts of People, united to one Head, <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> at lea&s;t in Appearance and Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle calls the UNITY of the <HI>vi&s;ible Church,</HI> the <HI>Unity</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> not only becau&s;e there is a real &s;piritual and &s;aving Union, between &s;ome of the vi&s;ible Church to CHRIST form'd by the Holy Spirit, from which the re&s;t are (Synecdochically) denominated; but al&s;o becau&s;e the external Union of the whole Church, is not Bodily, but Spiritual, namely of <HI>Minds</HI> agreeing among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>MOREOVER as the <HI>vi&s;ible Church</HI> is not the natural Body of CHRIST, and yet has a religious Relation to him, it may therefore be call'd his &s;piritual or my&s;tical Body vi&s;ible, or in Profe&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t; therefore the Union mu&s;t be &s;piritual al&s;o, of the &s;ame Kind with the Body to which it belongs.</P>
<P>BESIDES God, who is a <HI>Spirit,</HI> is the <HI>Author</HI> of this external Union of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians into Church Fellow&s;hip, or of their being outwardly in Covenant with him, which has a <HI>&s;pi|ritual</HI> and <HI>noble tendency</HI> to engage them to be the Lords; to affect their Spirits and turn them from Sin to God; in which re|&s;pect this external religious Relation to the Father of Spirits, may be truly called the <HI>Unity of the Spirit:</HI> So that here a two-fold Unity of the Spirit is enjoyn'd, <HI>viz. internal,</HI> of the Mind, in Sentiment and of the Will in Affection; and <HI>external</HI> in a joint partaking of outward, but &s;piritual, Ordinances of Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Word <HI>Bond (&s;unde&s;mos)</HI> &s;ignifies, that which connects one Thing with another, or that which joins one Thing to another.</P>
<P>NOW the <HI>Bond</HI> here enjoined is <HI>Peace. (eirene para to eis en eiren, a conectendo in unum,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Pa&s;or)</HI> The etymology of the Word <HI>Peace</HI> &s;ignifies to connect or join different Things into one; and this truly is the tendency of <HI>Peace;</HI> it removes Prejudices, a&s;&s;wages Re&s;entments, conciliates and unites Mens Minds, and
<PB N="12" REF="006423_0019_1028DE8151F49A78">
thus it pre&s;erves the Unity of the Church of God, which is broken by angry Contentions and Debates.</P>
<P><HI>PEACE</HI> cannot be kept without mutual <HI>forbearance</HI> in le&s;&s;er Things, which Mankind are apt to entertain very different Sen|timents of: But <HI>forbearance</HI> has no Place among the <HI>fierce</HI> and <HI>furious,</HI> but only among the <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>meek.

<P>NOW if the Command of GOD obliges us to prevent as much as in us lyes, in the U&s;e of all lawful Means, a Breach of the exter|nal Union of the Church of GOD, then by a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;e|quence, the &s;ame Command of GOD, obliges us to u&s;e all lawful Means to recover this Union, when it is broke: The&s;e two Things have an in&s;eparable Connection, he therefore that denies one, denies both con&s;equentially, and &s;o oppo&s;es the commanding Authority of Almighty GOD.</P>

<P>GOD knows there is great Need of the afore&s;aid <HI>Precept,</HI> and all the poignant <HI>Arguments</HI> whereby it is enforc'd, and of our attending thereto with all our Powers; for the Breaches of <HI>Union</HI> among the vi&s;ible Members of CHRIST'S Body, are as common as they are di&s;honourable and fatal! The Ignorance, the Pride, the Humour and Prejudice of Men's Hearts, di&s;po&s;e them &s;trongly to run into inumerable Sects, Parties, and Factions; and that under religious Pretexts of greater Purity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and doubtle&s;s in divers In&s;tances with pious Intentions, as if CHRIST mu&s;t be divided, as if his Kingdom was like to be &s;trengthened by crumbling it into little Parties, and &s;etting them by the Ears to tear one another to Pieces about Circum&s;tantials, while thro' the unhappy Influence of angry Debate, the chief Things of Religion, are for a Time, too much neglected, and the common Enemy laughs in his Sleeve at both!</P>
<P>SATAN has more Sen&s;e than that comes to, he knows by long Experience, that the Way for him to command, is to divide, and therefore he encourages <HI>Divi&s;ion,</HI> with all his Might, he &s;ecretly

blows up People's <HI>Pride, Prejudice</HI> and <HI>Re&s;entment,</HI> again&s;t each other, that &s;o he may bring them to open Ruptures, as well as fix them in that unhappy State, if po&s;&s;ible beyond a Retrieve: Then the Name of GOD is di&s;honoured, his People rendered contempti|ble, and Brethren by Profe&s;&s;ion and Principle in Fundamentals, as &s;infully as mi&s;erably engaged to vex and hurt one another in&s;tead of promoting their own, each others, and the publick good, and all this under religious Pretexts of <HI>Zeal</HI> for GOD, which makes &s;uch Conduct &s;it the ea&s;ier on Men's Minds; O Sirs! Is not the Chri&s;tian Church divided enough already, without any new Addi|tions? Con&s;ider how the <HI>Jews, Turks, Pagans&punc;</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> are &s;trengthened in their Prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;tianity altogether, by the &s;candalous Contentions and Divi&s;ions of the Profe&s;&s;ors of it! And yet more and more new Sects are &s;tarting up now and then! thro' the Agency of Men of hot Tempers, and narrow Minds, Lord have Mercy upon us! What &s;hall be the End of the&s;e Things?

It would look more like the Spirit of Chri&s;tianity, to endeavour by peaceable, calm and conde&s;cending Methods, to unite if po&s;&s;ible, the main Bodies of the Prote&s;tants (who hold the &s;ame Foundation Princi|ples) into one, than to tear afre&s;h the &s;eamle&s;s Coat of CHRIST into more Pieces and Shreds.</P>
<P>BUT on the contrary, <HI>how plea&s;ant is it for Brethren to dwell together in</HI> Unity? As the P&s;almi&s;t informs us, <HI>P&s;.</HI> cxxxiiii. 1. Here ob&s;erve, that this P&s;alm was compos'd upon the happy Occa|&s;ion of the Conclu&s;ion of the Civil Wars, between the two Hou&s;es of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> in which having felt the &s;ad Effects of Di&s;cord and Divi&s;ion, both the King and People were more &s;en&s;ible of the Ble&s;&s;ing of Peace and Union.</P>
<P><HI>BEHOLD how good, and how plea&s;ant it is for Brethren to dwell together in Unity. It is like the precious Ointment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even</HI> Aaron's <HI>Beard, that went down to the Shirts of his Garments, as the Dew of</HI> Hermon, <HI>and as the Dew that defended upon the Mountains of</HI> Zyon, <HI>for there the Lord commanded the Ble&s;&s;ing even Life for|evermore.</HI></P>
<P>THE Concord and Unity of Brethren, who profe&s;s the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential Principles, in mutual Love and Endearment, and in the &s;ocial united Ob&s;ervance of all the Ordinances of religious Wor|&s;hip, is good, plea&s;ant and profitable.</P>
<P>IT is <HI>good</HI> in it&s;elf, becau&s;e agreeable to the po&s;itive <HI>Command</HI> of GOD, and the Dictates of right <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> yea it is very good, it is more excellent, amiable, noble, and ornamental, than we can conceive or expre&s;s, and indeed it is not only good in it&s;elf, but it is good to us. For,</P>
<P>IT is <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> like the holy aromatick anointing <HI>Oyl,</HI> which was pour'd on <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Head, when he was con&s;ecrated to his
<PB N="15" REF="006423_0022_1028DE8B2804DF80">
high and honourable Office of <HI>Prie&s;thood,</HI> and that with &s;uch a liberal Effu&s;ion, that <HI>it ran down his Beard,</HI> and even to the <HI>Skirts of his Garment,</HI> filling the Hou&s;e with a bal&s;amick Odour, a dif|fu&s;ive delightful Fragrancy; this co&s;tly precious Unguent and Perfume which rejoice the Heart, was not conceal'd in, or con|fin'd to a Box, but pour'd forth with a generous Profu&s;ion, and rich Abundance. So nothing can be more agreeable to a truly pious Mind, than Union and Harmony, in Truth, in Purity, in Love! Moreover,</P>
<P>IT is <HI>profitable,</HI> as the <HI>Dew</HI> to the <HI>Earth,</HI> it is as the <HI>Dew of</HI> Hermon, <HI>and the Dew that de&s;cended upon the Mountains of</HI> Zyon, <HI>i. e.</HI> profitable both to Civil and Religious Societies, as the <HI>Dew</HI> is from <HI>Heaven,</HI> &s;o is religious Concord and Unity. As <HI>Dew</HI> is <HI>mild</HI> and gentle in its De&s;cent, not like the <HI>Rain</HI> which is &s;ome|times impetuous <HI>&s;tormy</HI> and violent; &s;o is Love, Concord and Uni|ty all Harmony, Gentlene&s;s and Sweetne&s;s; whereas Contention, and Divi&s;ion are har&s;h, di&s;cordant, furious!</P>
<P>MOREOVER, the <HI>Dew cools</HI> the &s;ultry <HI>Air,</HI> refre&s;hes the parch'd <HI>Glebe,</HI> and promotes its fruitfulne&s;s. So <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Unity</HI> cool our angry Re&s;entments, gently refre&s;h our labouring Bo&s;oms, and open a field of U&s;efulne&s;s before us.</P>
<P>AS the <HI>Dew</HI> makes the face of Nature Smile, and put on a verdent Ve&s;tment, &s;o <HI>Concord</HI> and <HI>Unity</HI> difu&s;e a univer&s;al Sweet|ne&s;s, evangelical Gaiety, and generous Beneficence; and under its Protection and Influence the &s;malle&s;t Things grow great and are e&s;tabli&s;hed; whereas by Di&s;cord and Di&s;union, together with the fatal Fruits thereof, their Springs of Solace and Sweetne&s;s are deeply ting'd with <HI>Mara's</HI> Waters, their beauty &s;tain'd, and their Strength broken.</P>
<P>FARTHER, Concord, Brotherly Love and Unity, are profita|ble, becau&s;e of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing of God.</HI> Such as dwell together in <HI>Unity</HI> and live in <HI>Love, the Lord commands upon them the Ble&s;&s;ing, even Life for evermore, i. e.</HI> the Almighty Wills that they be happy, who &s;o live. Where there is true Concord, there is the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, a happy affluence of all good, it &s;hall be well with them here and forever hereafter; for God will give them all the Mercies they need in this Life, together with the Re|mi&s;&s;ion of their Sins, and everla&s;ting Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in a future World. There, there the Lord commands the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> even Life forevermore, <HI>they that dwell in Love, dwell in God, and God in them, for God is Love.</HI> As the Perfection of <HI>Love</HI> is the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of Heaven, &s;o the Truth and Exerci&s;e of <HI>Love,</HI> is the foreta&s;te and earne&s;t of that Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s upon the Earth: And as it is &s;aid of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Dew,</HI> that <HI>it tarrieth not for Man, nor waiteth for the Sons of Men,</HI> (Mica. v. 7.) &s;o neither &s;hould our <HI>Love</HI> to our poor Brethren, tarry for their love to us, but generou&s;ly prevent and incite theirs.</P>
<P>I Have dwelt the longer upon the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Unity</HI> of the vi&s;ible Church, in which it re&s;embles the earthly <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> not

only becau&s;e of the great Moment and Importance of the&s;e Points, but al&s;o becau&s;e I fear, that they are either not fully un|der&s;tood, or not duly con&s;idered and &s;uitably e&s;teemed by divers that profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity. But to proceed,</P>
<P>JERUSALEM was a &s;trong <HI>City;</HI> it had not only <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Unity,</HI> but what is the con&s;equence of both, <HI>Strength;</HI> for ac|cording to the common but ju&s;t Proverb, <HI>unita vis fortior,</HI> Forces united are &s;tronger. But be&s;ides <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Order, Jeru&s;alem</HI> had impregnable <HI>Fortre&s;&s;es</HI> for Defence again&s;t her Enemies. And is not the vi&s;ible Church built upon a <HI>Rock, again&s;t which the Gates of Hell &s;hall not prevail; the Munition of Rocks is her Defence, and under the Wing of Jehovah &s;he may &s;afely tru&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>JERUSALEM</HI> was exceeding <HI>Beautiful</HI> in re&s;pect of its a|greeable <HI>Situation</HI> and magnificent <HI>Structures,</HI> particularly the <HI>Temple,</HI> which was the Wonder of the World, beautiful for Situation, <HI>the Joy of the whole Earth is Mount Zion, on the Sides of the North, the City of the great King.</HI> (P&s; xlviii. 2.) and hence &s;he was call'd even by Strangers, <HI>the perfection of Beauty,</HI> (Lam. ii. 5.) And is not the vi&s;ible Church upon this Account, compar'd to her. (Cant. vi. 4) <HI>Thou art Beautiful O my Love as Tirza, comely as Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Church</HI> becau&s;e of its &s;uperiour <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> and amiablene&s;s, is likewi&s;e compar'd to a <HI>Lilly</HI> and a <HI>Dove, as a Lilly among Thorns, &s;o is my Love among the Daughters; O my Dove, that art in the Clefts of the Rock, in the &s;ecret Places of the Stairs, let me &s;ee thy Countenance, let me hear thy Voice, for &s;weet is thy Voice and thy Countenance is comley;</HI> the Dove when attack'd by Birds of prey, has no Refuge but its <HI>Wings,</HI> by which it ha&s;tens to the Clefts of the Rock for &s;ecurity, nor does the Lilly when it is &s;haded and &s;crach'd by ob&s;tinate, unrelenting Thorns, dare to &s;cratch again!</P>
<P>AND for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, the vi&s;ible Church is compared to an <HI>Olive-Tree,</HI> (Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. xiv. 7.) <HI>His Branches &s;hall &s;pread, and his Beauty &s;hall be as the Olive Tree, and his &s;mell as</HI> Lebanon. <HI>She</HI> is likewi&s;e &s;aid <HI>to look forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun.</HI> Amiable as the fre&s;h ro&s;y <HI>Blu&s;hes</HI> of the open|ing Morn, the ri&s;ing Day, beautiful as the <HI>Moon,</HI> the Queen of Heaven, when uneclip&s;ed by envious Clouds, &s;he a&s;cends the &s;um|mit of the Horizon, bani&s;hes its gloom and darkne&s;s by her Silver Beams, and turns the Night into Day; or like the Sun, that glorious Orb of Light and Lamp of Heaven, when he appears in his meridian Splendor and Maje&s;ty! And hence every &s;incere Member of the vi&s;ible Church is &s;aid <HI>to be all glorious within,</HI> for the Beauty of Heaven, the Wonder of Angels, the Brightne&s;s of his Fathers Glory, <HI>makes them comely with his comeline&s;s which he puts upon them.</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was likewi&s;e the <HI>Temple,</HI> the KING'S <HI>Palace,</HI> or chief Place of Re&s;idence, which made it renown'd above other Cities. And is not the vi&s;ible Church the Habitation of the

I will al&s;o clothe her Prie&s;ts with Salvation, and her Saints &s;hall &s;hout aloud for Joy,</HI> P&s;. ix. 11. And cxxxii.</P>
<P>HERE let it be ob&s;erved, that the CHURCH of CHRIST is ei|their invi&s;ible or vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE <HI>invi&s;ible Church</HI> con&s;i&s;ts only of tho&s;e that are &s;incerely pious, whether in Heaven or upon Earth, &s;attered up and down in many Places, and Nations, and under a variety of Profe&s;&s;ions; this is the Catholick or univer&s;al Church which we profe&s;s to be|lieve, in that excellent <HI>Sumary</HI> of Chri&s;tian Principles, the Apo|&s;tles <HI>Creed,</HI> they are called the invi&s;ible Church, becau&s;e we are not able certainly to determine who they are in particular, their Principles of Action not being open to human Ob&s;ervance.</P>
<P>SUCH of this <HI>invi&s;ible Church</HI> as are on <HI>Earth,</HI> con&s;idered com|plexly, are called the <HI>Church militant,</HI> or Church-waring, becau&s;e in this Life they have many Mi&s;eries to endure, and many Ene|mies to conflict with, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Devil,</HI> the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>Fle&s;h;</HI> which afford con&s;tant Cau&s;e for Watchfulne&s;s and Humility; and frequent Occa&s;ions for Mourning and Combat; for in many Things we offend all; on this Account the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> affection|ately bewails his indwelling Corruption, the bitter Root of all ac|tual Di&s;orders, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI> Now the ble&s;&s;ed GOD has furni&s;hed his People for the <HI>Combat,</HI> with compleat Spiritual <HI>Armour,</HI> he provides a <HI>Helmet, Brea&s;t-plate, Sword, Shoe,</HI> and <HI>Shield;</HI> and urges them to put on this Armour, to &s;tand to their <HI>Arms,</HI> to <HI>fight,</HI> to <HI>quit them&s;elves like Men, and be &s;trong.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH of the <HI>invi&s;ible Church</HI> as are in <HI>Heaven,</HI> are call'd the <HI>Church triumphant,</HI> becau&s;e having fought the good Fight of Faith, fini&s;h'd their Cour&s;e and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ained compleat Victory over all their Enemies, they do in Heaven celebrate perpetually, the Triumphs of the Victory they have obtained, through di|vine Grace and Power, over every of their fatal Foes; and are there fully and finally deliver'd from the Reach of their Rage, as well as compleatly conform'd to the Purity of the divine <HI>Na|ture,</HI> and made Partakers of the divine <HI>Love,</HI> in a Degree to us at pre&s;ent inconceivable, and inexpre&s;&s;ible!</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>vi&s;ible Church</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of all tho&s;e that are <HI>baptiz'd,</HI> and profe&s;s <HI>Faith</HI> in the fundamental, or <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> and nece&s;&s;ary Truths of the Go&s;pel, which have mo&s;t direct Influence upon the Heart and Life.</P>
<P>THIS is a mixed Body of Good and Bad, which none can &s;e|parate from each other in this Life, nor &s;hould any attempt &s;uch an impracticable Ta&s;k. Our Lord, &s;o far as I can yet learn, has not given Authority to any Mini&s;ters, or Churches, to &s;u&s;pend
<PB N="18" REF="006423_0025_1028DE966EEA9EC0">
from, or ca&s;t out of their Communion, any who have a compe|tent Mea&s;ure of divine Knowledge, profe&s;s Faith in the Funda|mentals of the Chri&s;tian Religion, Subjection to the Government of the Church of CHRIST, and live a regular Life. The follow|ing <HI>Similitudes,</HI> to which CHRIST compares the <HI>vi&s;ible Church,</HI> &s;ufficiently confirm this.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t <HI>Similitude</HI> that I would mention is related by the Evangeli&s;t, <HI>Matthew</HI> xiii. from the 24th, to the 30th Ver&s;e, and runs thus, <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is likned unto a Man that &s;owed good Seed in his Field, but while Men &s;lept, his Enemy came and &s;owed Tares among the Wheat, and went away, but when the Blade was &s;prung up, and brought forth Fruit, then appeared the Tares al&s;o, &s;o the Servants of the Hou&s;holder came and &s;aid unto him, Sir, did&s;t thou not &s;ow good Seed in thy Field, from whence then hath it Tares? He &s;aid unto them, an Enemy hath done this, the Servants then &s;aid unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up, but he &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay; lea&s;t while ye gather up the Tares, ye root up al&s;o the Wheat with them; let them both grow together until the Harve&s;t, and in the Time of the Harve&s;t, I will &s;ay to the Reapers, gather ye together fir&s;t the Tares, and bind them in Bundles to burn them, but gather the Wheat into my Barn.</HI></P>
<P>THE Explication our Saviour gives of the Parable now men|tioned is this, <HI>He that &s;oweth the good Seed, is the Son of Man, the Field is the World, the good Seed are the Children of the Kingdom, but the Tares are the Children of the wicked One; the Enemy that &s;ow'd them is the Devil, the Harve&s;t is the End of the World, and the Reapers are the Angels.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING can be more plain and expre&s;s to the Point in Hand, than this <HI>Parable</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> together with his own Explication of it; if it be con&s;idered,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT by the Kingdom of Heaven, which is the Subject-Matter of this Di&s;cour&s;e, the vi&s;ible Church is to be under&s;tood, which is compared in the Ver&s;es immediately following, on ac|count of its &s;peedy Growth and Progre&s;s, in the early Times of Chri&s;tianity, to a <HI>Grain</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;tard-Seed,</HI> &s;oon becoming a Tree, and to <HI>Leaven</HI> hid in three Mea&s;ures of Meal, till the whole was leavened.</P>
<P>IT is called a <HI>Kingdom,</HI> becau&s;e in it as in temporal Kingdoms, there is a <HI>King</HI> to rule over it, namely JESUS CHRIST, <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> to be ruled over, <HI>Laws</HI> of Government, as well as a Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Obe|dience</HI> to them, and <HI>Subjection</HI> to the <HI>Prince</HI> of the Kings of the Earth, the <HI>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P>IT is called the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> becau&s;e the Original of the <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> of the vi&s;ible Church, was from Heaven and the <HI>Ten|dency</HI> thereof is Heavenly, and the final <HI>I&s;&s;ue</HI> to all that &s;incerely and believingly obey the Laws of this Kingdom, is Heaven or Salvation: And hence the King of it is &s;aid to be <HI>the Author of eternal Salvation to all that obey him.</HI> GOD the Father

<P>THE vi&s;ible Church is ju&s;tly called the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven</HI> in Scripture, tho' there are many Hypocrites in it; becau&s;e CHRIST governs it as a KING, and there is a remnant in it, that are willingly &s;ubject to his governing Authority, who is the Lord from Heaven, from whom as the better part it is deno|minated, this <HI>Church</HI> is the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> upon Earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of this <HI>Parable</HI> is twofold, 1&s;t.

And 2d. That the Servants of the Church, the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and other <HI>Church Officers,</HI> mu&s;t not attempt to &s;eparate the <HI>bad</HI> from the <HI>good,</HI> who are in the vi&s;ible Church, who have &s;uch a re&s;emblance of Wheat, of Piety in their outward Appearance, that they cannot be rooted out, without the Hazard of a mi&s;take, and in con&s;equence of it, rooting up the Wheat with them, as Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> ob&s;erves.</P>

<P>Here ob&s;erve the following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1 THAT the <HI>vi&s;ible Church</HI> is Chri&s;t's <HI>Floor, (I&s;a.</HI> xxi. 10.) the Temple, a Type of it was built upon a thre&s;hing Floor.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="24" REF="006423_0031_1028DEAB8ADB4818">2. THAT in this <HI>Floor</HI> there is a mixture of <HI>Chaff</HI> and <HI>Wheat,</HI> good and bad, in the &s;ame outward Communion.</P>

<P N="4">4.

<P>A FAN of the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> or of Sufferings upon a religious Account, whereby &s;ometimes much <HI>Chaff</HI> is blown away from the <HI>Wheat.</HI></P>
<P>A FAN of <HI>Judgment,</HI> whereby CHRIST &s;earches the <HI>Heart and Reins of all the Children of Men,</HI> and di&s;tingui&s;hes the mo&s;t &s;ubtle Hypocrite from the truly Pious, and will openly &s;eparate them all from each other, in the great Day of his coming, in vertue of a &s;upreme judicial Authority, a&s;&s;ign'd him by his Father, as a Re|ward of his Aba&s;ement; this is his peculiar <HI>Prerogative</HI> and in|communicable <HI>Royalty,</HI> which it is great <HI>Sacriledge</HI> for any to a&s;&s;ume.

<P><HI>PEACE</HI> with our Neighbour is threefold, viz. <HI>Oeconomical, Political, Eecle&s;ia&s;tical.</HI></P>
<P><HI>PEACE Oeconomical,</HI> or quiet in the <HI>Family,</HI> is a comforta|ble Privilege, (P&s;al. cvii. 41.) <HI>He &s;etteth the Poor on high from Affliction, and maketh him Families like a Flock; the Righteous &s;hall &s;ee it and rejoyce, and all Iniquity &s;hall &s;top her Mouth.</HI> Among the &s;urprizing Changes which a &s;overeign <HI>Providence</HI> brings to pa&s;s &s;ometimes among the Affairs of the Children of Men, this that the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> mentions in this P&s;alm, is very remarkable. That while the Almighty aba&s;es the Great and Honourable, pours Contempt on <HI>Princes</HI> that abu&s;e their Authority, and &s;light his Mercy, while he dethrones them from their Grandeur and Dignity, reduces them to di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;traits, and Cau&s;es them to wander in the Wilderne&s;s where there is no Way; baffles their Councils, and breaks their Pride and Pomp. He in the mean Time exalts the Humble, he &s;etteth the Poor on high, he rai&s;es them from the Du&s;t of meane&s;s and ob&s;curity, to Places of Tru&s;t and Honour. And that which adds equal Security, Beauty and Ea&s;e to their <HI>Elevation,</HI> is the number and quietne&s;s of their Children and Families, <HI>he makes their Families like a Flock;</HI> a Flock of <HI>Sheep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> numerous indeed; but meek, peaceful, u&s;eful, &s;ociable, in this re&s;embling the true and living Members of the Church of Chri&s;t, who are cloathed with this in&s;tructive amiable <HI>Character. (John</HI> x) When ones Family is quiet and calm, it is a noble <HI>A&s;ylum,</HI> a little Sanctuary to retreat to from Tempe&s;ts abroad, a great Satisfaction and Support in Life, that &s;ooths all our Sorrows, &s;weetens all our Labours and Anxieties, and lulls every Grief to re&s;t. But the Contrary is no little Addition to our other Calamities; it &s;torms us from our proper Place of Refuge and Retreat; puts Vinegar and Nitre into our Wounds, and adds double weight to all our Woes!</P>
<P><HI>PEACE Political,</HI> or quiet in the <HI>State,</HI> (of the right Kind) is a freedom from War, with National Enemies, upon a &s;afe and honourable Foundation, and a <HI>Union</HI> and Harmony among our|&s;elves, re&s;pecting Matters of a civil Nature.</P>
<P>THEN we no more hear the confus'd noi&s;e of the <HI>Warrior,</HI> or &s;ee <HI>Garments roll'd in Blood,</HI> a rueful, pitious &s;pectacle, that can|not but excite, in generous Bo&s;oms, the &s;ofte&s;t Sympathy's of Sor|row, the tendere&s;t Sentiments of Humanity!</P>
<P>HOW amiable, de&s;irable and valuable a Benefit mu&s;t <HI>political Peace</HI> (of the right Kind) be; it opens a plea&s;ing &s;cene of <HI>Plenty</HI> before us, and frees us from innumerable <HI>Anxieties,</HI> (P&s;al. clxvii. 14.) <HI>He maketh Peace in thy Borders and filleth thee with the fine&s;t of the Wheat.</HI></P>

<P><HI>PEACE Eccle&s;ia&s;tical,</HI> or <HI>Peace</HI> in the Church, is oppo&s;ed both to <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> from within, in its own Body, and <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> from without, from open Enemies. This <HI>Peace,</HI> with <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t important Mercies upon Earth.

<P>NOW &s;eing that the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> is e&s;pecially intended, let us fix our Meditations upon this momentuous <HI>Subject,</HI> for a little while, and enquire&punc; what is intended by the PEACE of JE|RUSALEM?</P>

<P>NOW as <HI>Peace</HI> generally &s;uppo&s;es <HI>Contention</HI> and <HI>Debate,</HI> and &s;ometimes in con&s;equence thereof, an open <HI>Breach</HI> of <HI>Union,</HI> &s;o under this View, it <HI>implies</HI> the&s;e Things following, <HI>viz,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1.

<P>And tho' we all in Words di&s;claim the Doctrines of <HI>Infalibility</HI> in Judgment, and <HI>Perfection</HI> in Practice; yet it would &s;eem that many hold both practically; for they look upon it to be a very great <HI>di&s;grace</HI> to be convinced of any <HI>Mi&s;take</HI> in Opinion, even in le&s;&s;er Things, and any <HI>mi&s;conduct</HI> in Practice con&s;eque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> there|upon; and therefore to prevent that fal&s;e <HI>Di&s;grace,</HI> they will hold fa&s;t their pretended <HI>Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hodoxy</HI> in every punctilio with the &s;toute&s;t ob&s;tinacy!</P>

And if that be the Ca&s;e, that we mu&s;t hold every No|tion we have had, right or wrong, it is certainly be&s;t to avoid clo&s;e thinking upon Things altogether, and examining of them, lea&s;t thereby we be forc'd to quit &s;ome <HI>Notion</HI> we have held before, or in other Words, we mu&s;t maintain, with the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> that <HI>ignorance is the Mother of Devotion!</HI> Farther.</P>

<P>IN general I may ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Terms</HI> that &s;hould be pro|pos'd, are &s;uch as tend to pre&s;erve and tran&s;mit, pure and uncor|rupted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the late&s;t Po&s;terity, the <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> and nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Truths</HI> of CHRIST on the one Hand, and yet to maintain inviolable the LIBERTY <HI>wherewith</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>has made us free,</HI> upon the other, and not entangle our&s;elves again with a new <HI>Yoke</HI> of Bondage of human Invention, and thereby open awful Occa&s;ion for a con|tinued &s;eries of Schi&s;ms, Convul&s;ions and Confu&s;ions in the Church of God.</P>
<P>NOW the &s;criptural <HI>Terms</HI> of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union,</HI> are either <HI>Doctrinal</HI> or <HI>Practical.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Doctrinal Term</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> which our LORD has appointed, is a Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> and nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Articles,</HI> in Doctrine, Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline, contained in the holy Scriptures, agreeable to which are our excellent <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, Catechi&s;ms</HI> and <HI>Directory</HI> for Wor&s;hip and Government.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>Terms</HI> are truly Scriptural, ina&s;much as we are enjoin'd in the &s;acred Oracles, by the &s;ame &s;upream Authority, to <HI>reject Hereticks,</HI> or tho&s;e that ob&s;tinately hold <HI>fundamental Errors, after the fir&s;t and &s;econd Admonition,</HI> and in the mean Time <HI>to receive the Weak,</HI> who hold circum&s;tantial Errors, being in other Things &s;ound.

<P>And indeed the&s;e <HI>terms</HI> are <HI>rational, Catholick,</HI> and <HI>peaceable,</HI> they may be defended by Argument, and no other that I know of, they are a noble <HI>Medium</HI> between two dangerous <HI>Extreams</HI> of unju&s;tifyable <HI>&s;everity</HI> upon the one Hand, and Criminal <HI>laxne&s;s,</HI> on the other, the former of which encroaches upon our <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the latter is Prejudicial to <HI>Truth,</HI> both which ought to be ever Dear to us! If any other Method be&s;ides what is before men|tioned be taken, either fundamental Truths will be betray'd, or good Men rejected, whom we are commanded to receive, and who when receiv'd, are like to be of &s;ervice to CHRIST'S Kingdom.</P>

<P>AND tho' the Number of <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> and nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Articles</HI> has not hitherto been determined, by any <HI>Church</HI> that I know of, yet every Per&s;on, and of Con&s;equence every <HI>Church,</HI> as &s;uch, mu&s;t certainly have a right to determine for them&s;elves, what they reckon to be &s;uch.

<P>THE Practical <HI>Term</HI> of Peace and Union in Churches where there are complaints of <HI>Mi&s;conduct,</HI> are either an Expre&s;s verbal acknowledgement of them in Things of a <HI>Moral</HI> nature, or a <HI>Reformation</HI> from them.</P>
<P>NO doubt in <HI>Churches</HI> form'd and united, an explicit open ver|bal Acknowledgment, &s;hould be required, e&s;pecially for gro&s;s In|&s;tances of immoral Conduct, which the Light of Nature teaches the Sinfulne&s;s of.</P>
<P>BUT when the <HI>Church</HI> is either in its <HI>Infancy</HI> not fully form'd, or in a <HI>broken</HI> and <HI>divided State,</HI> and when there is a <HI>Reformation</HI> from the Evils complain'd of, and urging a <HI>verbal Acknowledgement</HI> tends to open wider the bleeding Wounds of the Church, to tear her in pieces; and con&s;equently to de&s;troy her; it &s;hould not be in&s;i&s;ted on even in re&s;pect of gro&s;s <HI>Immorality;</HI> becau&s;e the De&s;ign of <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> is an&s;wered by Reformation in &s;uch Ca&s;es, and much le&s;s &s;hould it be even propo&s;ed at all, in <HI>Matters</HI> which are (com|paratively &s;peaking) of a <HI>doubtful</HI> Nature, and have long &s;ince happened; to &s;ay that there &s;hould be no <HI>Moderation</HI> us'd in the <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> of the <HI>Church, (no epeceia juris)</HI> no Variation of it's <HI>Exer|ci&s;e,</HI> under different Circum&s;tances and A&s;pect, in &s;uch a Manner as tends to pre&s;erve the <HI>Church</HI> from Ruin, is to &s;ay in <HI>effect</HI> that it is unrea&s;onable and indefen&s;ible, and con&s;equently to impute to JESUS CHRIST the <HI>Author</HI> of it, either want of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> or want of <HI>Love,</HI> in forming the <HI>Plan</HI> or Model of it's In&s;titution, both which are fal&s;e, and bla&s;phemous, and of Con&s;equence that from which &s;uch Con&s;equences naturally and ea&s;ily flow; to apply the &s;ame <HI>Medicine</HI> to the Body in all the Variety of it's <HI>Maladies</HI> in the &s;ame Manner, and in the &s;ame Degre, would tend to kill in&s;tead of a Cure, and thus it is in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Matters.

<P>BUT is <HI>Charity</HI> blind?</P>
<P>I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> No, not quite, But yet it hopes the be&s;t of others, as long as it can, with any Rea&s;on; and when it is con&s;trained by glaring Evidence, to &s;ee <HI>Evil</HI> in others, its View is attend|ed with Reluctance and Sorrow; and in the mean Time it makes all the <HI>Apology</HI> it can for them: Thus we do for our&s;elves, and are we not commanded to <HI>love others as we do our&s;elves?</HI> Charity is glad when others are vindicated from fal&s;e Charges.</P>
<P>BUT tho' <HI>Charity</HI> be not quite blind, yet it has not the &s;harp Sight of the <HI>Lynx,</HI> in &s;pying others <HI>Faults,</HI> while it is blind to its own; but inclines the <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> of it, to be mo&s;t inqui&s;itive into his own Conduct, and mo&s;t &s;evere again&s;t the Faults of it. The Nature of <HI>Charity,</HI> or Love, as <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, is <HI>to cover a mul|titude of Sins</HI> of our Brother. (<HI>Pro.</HI> x. 12.)

<P>He is truly a <HI>Murderer,</HI> who has a Murdering Mind, which he cer|tainly has who is angry with, and reproaches his Brother without a Cau&s;e; reproach is no farther from Wrath, then beating from re|proach, and Murder from beating: There is a dreadful train and con|nection, between the different Degrees of this Henious and Perilous Iniquity.

<P><PB N="44" REF="006423_0051_1028DEF384ADF7B0">NOW there are various kinds of evil Speaking, which are pernicious to the Peace of Society, the chief of which are the&s;e two, viz. <HI>Slander</HI> and <HI>ra&s;h judging.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e, viz. <HI>Slander,</HI> is manifold and exceeding malignant, (Prov. x. 18.) <HI>He that hideth hatred with lying Lips, and he thut uttereth Slander, is a Fool.</HI> All Malice is folly and wickedne&s;s; it is &s;o when concealed by Flattery and Di&s;&s;imula|tion: Lying Lips are bad enough of them&s;elves, but have a pe|culiar Perver&s;ene&s;s in them when made a cloak of Maliciou&s;ne&s;s; and cannot be hid from God, who is Omni&s;cient, to him the <HI>Darkne&s;s is as the Light, and the Midnight as the Morning.</HI></P>
<P>NOR is it any better when vented in &s;piteful and mi&s;cheivous
<PB N="45" REF="006423_0052_1028DEF66AE0D650">
Language, <HI>he that uttereth Slander is a Fool,</HI> for God will &s;ooner or later bring forth that Righteou&s;ne&s;s as the Light, which is hereby clouded and eclip&s;ed, and will find an expedient to roll the unju&s;t Reproach away.</P>
<P>NOW the general Nature of the Sin of <HI>Slander,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>fal&s;e Accu&s;ation</HI> of our Neighbour, which is forbidden by the ninth Command, and is a great Wickedne&s;s, con&s;idered in every &s;hape and form</P>
<P>IF it is publickly and upon Oath before civil Courts of Judi|cature, it is called, <HI>bearing fal&s;e Witne&s;s again&s;t our Neighbour,</HI> or <HI>Perjury,</HI> which is forbidden by the ninth Command, and is an Evil of horible malignity! When we call God to Witne&s;s what we know to be fal&s;e, it is one of the ba&s;e&s;t Bla&s;phemies, the rude&s;t In&s;ults that can be offered to the <HI>Deity,</HI> and one of the greate&s;t <HI>Injuries</HI> to Men that can be committed. He that invokes the Al|mighty to atte&s;t a <HI>Lye,</HI> either imagines that he knows not the <HI>Truth,</HI> and &s;o imputes Ignorance to him; or that he is not di&s;|plea&s;ed with it, and &s;o denies his <HI>Purity,</HI> or that he is not able to avenge it, and &s;o contemns his Power and Almightine&s;s. Now is there much difference between denying the&s;e Perfections of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> without which he cannot exi&s;t, and the Athei&s;tical denial of his Being altogether? No &s;urely.</P>
<P>AND as to Men, <HI>Perjury</HI> is not only a wrong to particular Per&s;ons, but it is <HI>Trea&s;on</HI> again&s;t human Society in general; it &s;aps the very Foundations of publick Peace and Ju&s;tice, and the private Security of every Mans Property, Honour, Life, and Fortune; yea and cruelly turns the equitable Laws, which were de&s;ign'd for the Defence of the Inocent, and Puni&s;hment of the Guilty, into an Engine of Ruin to the former, and Promotion to the latter! What can be more horrible than this? Ju&s;tly therefore does <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erve, that a fal&s;e Witne&s;s again&s;t his Neighbour, <HI>is a Maul, and a Sword, and a &s;harp Arrow.</HI> (Prov. xxv. 18) This Iniquity entails a <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> upon the Per&s;on guilty of it, and his Po&s;terity, (Zec. v. 4.) <HI>I will bring the Cur&s;e forth, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, and it &s;hall enter into the Hou&s;e of the Thief, and of him that &s;weareth fal&s;ely by my Name, and it &s;hall remain in the mid&s;t of his Hou&s;e, and con&s;ume it, with the Timber thereof, and the Stones thereof.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when <HI>Slander</HI> is out of Court, and before a Per&s;ons Face, and accompanied with har&s;h Words, it is term'd <HI>railing, (Jude</HI> 9.) We are told, that when <HI>Michael</HI> the <HI>Archangel,</HI> con|tended with the Devil about the Body of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> he did not <HI>bring again&s;t him a railing Accu&s;ation,</HI> he knew he was no <HI>match</HI> for <HI>Satan</HI> at that, which is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his proper Province; it is his con&s;tant Practice <HI>to accu&s;e the Brethren,</HI> (Rev. xii. 10.) the good <HI>Angel</HI> only mildly &s;aid, <HI>the Lord Rebuke thee.</HI> And as Railers and fal&s;e Accu&s;ers are faithful followers of their <HI>Father</HI> the <HI>Devil, who was a lyar and a murderer from the Beginning, and abode not in the Truth;</HI> &s;o the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that

<P>MOREOVER, <HI>Flattery</HI> in Peoples Pre&s;ence, or unju&s;t Commen|dation, the Evil contrary to the former, ought with great Care to be avoided.

<P>BUT becau&s;e LYING is included in <HI>Slander,</HI> and of dreadful Tendency to Society, I &s;hall &s;peak a little of its <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Malignity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AUGUSTINE</HI> gives this De&s;cription of its <HI>Nature,</HI> viz. <HI>That it is a voluntary &s;peaking of an untruth, with de&s;ign to deceive.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a &s;peaking of an untruth, yea what we know to be &s;uch; for to lye is to go again&s;t the Mind. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mentire, e&s;t contra mentem ire.</NOTE></P>
<P>FARTHER, it is uttered with an Intention to deceive the Per|&s;on to whom it is &s;poken; and therefore <HI>Parables</HI> are no <HI>lyes,</HI> tho' they be not litterally true, becau&s;e not uttered with a de|&s;ign to deceive, and their <HI>Scope</HI> is true; thus our Lord is called, parabolically a <HI>Door,</HI> a <HI>Rock,</HI> a <HI>Fountain.</HI> Nor are <HI>Hyperboles</HI> lyes, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, tho they be not litterally and &s;trictly true; hence the Spies a&s;&s;erted, in their return from <HI>Canaan,</HI> that <HI>the Walls were up to Heaven;</HI> their meaning was, that the Walls were very high. In like manner it is &s;aid, that if all our Lord had done was written, the World it&s;elf would not contain the Books; this was not expre&s;&s;ed with a De&s;ign to deceive, but to convince of Error; the meaning was no more than that many Things CHRIST did were not Recorded.</P>
<P>NOR are <HI>Ironies</HI> lies, tho' they be not litterally true, (1 King xviii. 27.) <HI>He mocked them and &s;aid, cry aloud for he is a God.</HI> This was not uttered with a de&s;ign to deceive, but to convince of Error, and reprove upon the Account of it.</P>
<P>I may add, that a Per&s;ons acting contrary to what he before &s;aid, is not lying, if the Circum&s;tances of a Thing be altered, (Gen. xix. 2.) The Angels told <HI>Lot</HI> that they would not come into his <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> but abide in the <HI>Street</HI> all Night; yet upon his importunity they went in with him: And &s;o <HI>Peter</HI> with &s;ome Ve+hemency refu&s;ed that CHRIST &s;hould wa&s;h his Feet, but when he was in&s;tructed in the Significancy of this Conde&s;cen&s;ion of our SAVIOUR, he intreated him to do it. But in the mean Time this Caution mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the Actions be not &s;uch as we are bound to by divine Precept, or &s;uch as we have bound our|&s;elves to, by &s;ome Vow to God, or &s;uch that our neglect of them will be prejudicial to others; for if we have promi&s;ed to another what is beneficial to him, however we have changed our Opinion, we mu&s;t not change our Purpo&s;e, unle&s;s he relea&s;e us, or hath fail'd in the Condition of the Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>DIVINES do generally di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Lyes</HI> into three Kinds, viz. <HI>Joco&s;e, Officious</HI> and <HI>Malicious,</HI></P>
<P>JOCOSE <HI>Lyes</HI> are told to divert the Company; but it is too ex|pen&s;ive a Method to divert others by, for &s;uch as lye in Je&s;t mu&s;t expect to go to Hell in Earne&s;t, except they repent; be&s;ides it prepares Per&s;ons for that which is of a more malignant Kind.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="006423_0059_1028DF1427CFE8E8">OFFICIOUS <HI>Lyes</HI> are told with de&s;ign to do &s;ome kind Office to others; but <HI>we mu&s;t not do Evil that Good may come.</HI> Bi&s;hop <HI>Saunder&s;on</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves upon this Head, <Q>That we know not a greater Good than the Glory of God; that we know not a le&s;&s;er Sin, if any Sin may be called little, than a Joco&s;e lye, yet may not this be done for that, <HI>wilt thou &s;peak wick|edly for God, or talk deceitfully for him,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Zophar</HI> to <HI>Job,</HI> and &s;urely if we may not &s;peak deceitfully for God, much le&s;s for Man.</Q> But</P>
<P>MALICIOUS <HI>Lyes</HI> are when Per&s;ons endeavour to fix fal&s;e Charges de&s;ignedly, upon the Inocent for their Hurt.</P>
<P>NOW lying of every Kind, e&s;pecially of the la&s;t, is a Viola|tion of God's Precept, which enjoins us, <HI>not to lye one to another,</HI> (Col. iii. 9.) and that we &s;hould <HI>put away lying and &s;peaking guile,</HI> (Ephe&s;. iv. 25.)</P>
<P>LYING is al&s;o <HI>odious</HI> to the God of Truth: <HI>A lying Tongue is one of the &s;even Things that are an abomination to him.</HI> (Pro vi.)</P>
<P>LYING tends to the <HI>De&s;truction</HI> of human <HI>Society,</HI> and con|tradicts the U&s;e and End of Speech, which is to promote Com|munion and Commerce, and therefore it's implicitly agreed to by all Men to &s;peak <HI>Truth</HI> to one another. But if <HI>lying</HI> be in|dulged, how can Society be promoted, when mutual Confidence and Love are broken? Seeing that Truth is a Debt we owe to all that we conver&s;e with, <HI>lying</HI> mu&s;t needs be unju&s;t and lead to every Injury, Violence, and Rapine. The&s;e Evils naturally follow Mens making no Con&s;cience of performing their Pro|mi&s;es and Contracts.</P>
<P>LYING is ba&s;e and ignoble; it ju&s;tly brings a <HI>blot</HI> upon the <HI>Character</HI> of him who is guilty of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, when it is found out, as it generally is at the long r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, becau&s;e of their Incon&s;i&s;tencies: It &s;hews a ba&s;e, cowardly Di&s;po&s;ition not to dare to tell the Truth. This Evil is not only hated by God, but by good Men. <HI>I hate and abhor lying,</HI> &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>he that tells Lies &s;hall not tarry in my Hou&s;e,</HI> (P&s;al. ci. 7.)</P>
<P>LYING is an <HI>Imitation</HI> of the <HI>Devil, who when he &s;peaketh a Lye, &s;peaketh of his own,</HI> i. e. agreeable to his natural Inclination and Genius, for <HI>he is a lyar and the Father of it, he was a Mur|derer from the Beginning, and abode not in the Truth.</HI> (Joh. viii. 44) Ob&s;erve Malice is joined with lying, in the Character of <HI>Satan;</HI> he is a <HI>Murderer</HI> as well as a <HI>Lyar,</HI> to &s;hew that malicious lying is the <HI>fir&s;t born</HI> of the <HI>Devil,</HI> the <HI>Beginning</HI> of his <HI>Strength,</HI> for by Lyes he prevailed over Mankind at fir&s;t, and therefore this is his darling Sin. When Per&s;ons <HI>lye,</HI> they but repeat what <HI>Satan</HI> dictates; hence is that &s;aying of <HI>Peter's,</HI> (Act v. 3.) <HI>Why hath Satan fill'd thine Heart to lie unto the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>LYING is not only very Criminal but very Dangerous, it cracks the Credit of the Guilty Per&s;on, when found out; tho&s;e that are accu&s;tom'd to lye, will not be believ'd when they &s;peak the

Truth; and its generally found out pretty &s;oon; its generally and ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd to be one of the <HI>ba&s;e&s;t evils,</HI> becau&s;e it bewrays a cowardly fear of Man, and mo&s;t daring Contempt of GOD! whoever lyes does it out of &s;ome &s;ordid fear, lea&s;t &s;ome Incon|venience &s;hould come upon them if they told the Truth: And this <HI>Montaign</HI> in his E&s;&s;ays, gives as the Rea&s;on why the Charge of lying is the mo&s;t reproachful Ignominy, which can be ca&s;t upon any, and therefore excites Men to the mo&s;t warm re&s;ent|ments: Indeed lying unfits Per&s;ons for common Conver&s;e, and for all Bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P>LYING is an awful Evidence of a bad State: A cour&s;e of lying proves Per&s;ons to be the genuine <HI>Children</HI> of the <HI>Devil,</HI> who is the <HI>Father</HI> of <HI>Lyes.</HI> On the contrary <HI>Truth</HI> in <HI>Speech,</HI> is the <HI>Character</HI> of GOD'S <HI>People, (I&s;.</HI> lxiii. 8.) <HI>Surely they are my People, Children that will not lye.</HI> Unle&s;s we make Con&s;cience of avoiding all tho&s;e Kinds of evil Speaking, that I have mentioned, we cannot con&s;i&s;tently or &s;ucce&s;sfully, Endeavour after Peace.

<P>THERE is, &s;ayeth <HI>Pareus,</HI> <Q>a natural Impotency in Man to know &s;piritual Things, partly thro' want of Light in the Mind, and partly thro' the Corruption of the Will, becau&s;e &s;piritual Things are di&s;cerned, apprehended, and di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;piritually, <HI>i. e.</HI> by a &s;piritual Under&s;tanding and Light of Faith, or by the Influence of the Holy Spirit.</Q> To this pur|po&s;e &s;peak <HI>Beza, Pi&s;cator, Era&s;mus,</HI> and <HI>Arias Montanus.</HI></P>

<P>ALL THINGS.

To under&s;tand the Word ALL in an ab&s;olute unlimited Sen&s;e, charges <HI>fal&s;ehood</HI> upon the Apo&s;tle; for we are &s;ure that every &s;piritual Man, nay not one of them in this Life, under&s;tands <HI>all Things,</HI> both natural, civil and religious; and if the Word be re&s;tricted to <HI>religious Matters,</HI> yet without limitation, it is not true: Every &s;piritual Man under&s;tands not the whole Sy&s;tem or Analogy of Faith, in all its Branches, and their mutual Re|lations and Dependencies. Nor do many of them under&s;tand the Chronological Difficulties of the Scriptures, or perceive the great variety of their Rethorical Charms, and Elegancies, &amp;c. So that the true meaning of the Words, is no more than this, that the regenerated Per&s;on di&s;cerns, apprehends and di&s;tingui&s;hes the grand <HI>peculiars</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel Method</HI> of <HI>Salvation,</HI> by the <HI>Death</HI> of the SON of GOD, di&s;cerns Things that are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to his own Salvation, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT he him&s;elf, in the mean Time, is di&s;cerned or known cer|tainly, by none, by no Man; and hence God's People are called his <HI>hidden ones,</HI> (P&s;a. lxxxiii. 3.)

<P>But do we not read of that Gift of <HI>di&s;cerning</HI> of <HI>Spirits</HI> being given?</P>
<P>I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> Yes, we read of it in 1 Cor. xii. 10. <HI>To another the working of Miracles, to another Prophe&s;y, to another di&s;cerning of Spirits, to another divers Kinds of Tongues.</HI> <Q>This was a Power, &s;ays <HI>Pool,</HI> wherein God for the farther Authority and Credit of his Go&s;pel, in the Primitive Times, communicated to &s;ome Men &s;omething of his own <HI>Prerogative,</HI> to di&s;cern Mens inward Thoughts and Hearts, and to make up a Judg|ment of their Truth and Sincerity; or contrawi&s;e of their Fal&s;ehood and Hypocri&s;y.</Q> This was an extraordinary and admirable faculty given even to private Men, to di&s;cover and re|prove fanatical Spirits, and fal&s;e and develi&s;h Prophets, of which there were many at that Time. (1 Joh. iv. 1) And hence the fal&s;e Pretender is &s;aid <HI>to be convinced of all, and judged of all,</HI> (1 Cor. xiv. 24.) or as the original Word &s;ignifies, <HI>di&s;cerned of all.</HI> But this Gift &s;eems to have been e&s;pecially given to &s;uch as pre|&s;ided <HI>(pro tempore)</HI> among the Presbiters, who often met to judge of this Matter.

<P>THIS was a miraculous Gift as well as the re&s;t joined with it in the &s;ame Ver&s;e; &s;o that for any to pretend to it now, when miraculous Gifts are cea&s;ed, is the vaine&s;t Vanity!

<P>I THINK it his highly probable, that it was by this Method of Miraculous <HI>di&s;cerning,</HI> that the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> try'd tho&s;e, which &s;aid they were Apo&s;tles, and were not, and upon Tryal found them to be Lyars; becau&s;e it was the ea&s;ie&s;t, &s;peedie&s;t Me|thod, and did at that Time obtain in the Church.</P>
<P>BUT if it was not &s;o, they doubtle&s;s try'd them by their <HI>fruits,</HI> that is by their <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Lives,</HI> &s;ay <HI>Pi&s;cator,</HI> and <HI>Beza;</HI> the Pretenders fal&s;ely &s;aid they were Apo&s;tles, immediately &s;ent in an extraordinary Manner as <HI>Paul</HI> was: Now an excellent Method of knowing &s;uch, &s;ays <HI>Grotius,</HI> was if they privately &s;ought after

Many fal&s;e Pro|phets had gone forth, of which they had &s;ufficient warning, (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 3. <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 29, 30.)

<P>BUT does not our LORD a&s;&s;ure us, that we may judge the Tree, by the Fruits.</P>
<P>I ANSWER our LORD informs us, that we may <HI>know</HI> the Tree by the Fruits, (<HI>Mat</HI> xii. 33.) Our Saviour does not propo&s;e a cer|tain, but only a probable Sign, he &s;peaks of Things as they hap|pen generally, as <HI>Maldonate</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves; he does not &s;ay that a bad Tree cannot become good, but that while it is bad, it cannot bring forth good Fruit. (i. e. &s;piritually good) a bad Tree cannot bring forth good Fruits, unle&s;s it be engrafted, and a good Tree will bring forth bad, if it be not cultivated; &s;ays <HI>Tertullian.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Non dabit arbor mala bonos fructus, &s;i non in&s;eratur, et bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> malos dabit, &s;i non colatur Tertul.</NOTE> The Fruits CHRIST &s;peaks of, are the Doctrines and Lives of Men, &s;o <HI>Simachus Maldonate, Hammond</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST'S memorable Negative <HI>Precept,</HI> mention'd (<HI>Mat.</HI> vii. 1, 2, 3.) &s;trongly confirms what has been now &s;aid, <HI>Judge not that ye be not judg'd, for with what Judgment ye judge, ye &s;hall be judged, and why beholde&s;t thou the Mote, that is in thy Brothers Eye, but con&s;idere&s;t not the Beam that is in thy own Eye.</HI></P>
<P>THAT which is here forbidden, &s;aith <HI>Pool</HI> in his Annotations, <Q>is either, 1&s;t. Ra&s;h-Judgment of his State, or a judging him for doing his Duty, &s;uch was <HI>Simons</HI> or the Di&s;ciples Judgment re&s;pecting the Woman, (<HI>Mat.</HI> xxvi. 6, 7.) Or, 2d. A Judge|ing of others, for Things, which they judge to be indifferent, forbidden. (<HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 1, 2, 3.) Or, 3d. a Judging of them for &s;ecret Things, &s;uch as inward Habits of Grace, when no apparent Fruits to the contrary are &s;een, or a condemning others for &s;ingle Acts, or a Publick cen&s;uring others for private failings.</Q></P>
<P><HI>FOR with what Judgment ye judge, ye &s;hall be judged;</HI> that is, <Q>the ordinary Temper of Men and Judgment of GOD, will not leave &s;uch a Practice unrewarded,</Q> they are generally paid in this World in their own Coin, <HI>good Mea&s;ure, pre&s;&s;ed down and runing over.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ame worthy Author farther ob&s;erves from that &s;aying of our Saviour, <HI>And why beholde&s;t thou the Mote that is in thy

Brothers Eye, but con&s;idere&s;t not the Beam that is in thine own,</HI> the&s;e Things following. <Q>1. That tho&s;e who are mo&s;t cen&s;o|rious of others, are u&s;ually more notorious them&s;elves, if not for the &s;ame Sins; yet for others of equal if not greater Magnitude. 2d. That it is notorious <HI>Hypocricy,</HI> to &s;py &s;maller faults in others, and not to &s;ee greater in our&s;elves. 3d. that is notorious Impudence, to pretend to Cen&s;ure and Judge others, for Sins in which we live our&s;elves. 4th. That there is no &s;uch Way to teach us <HI>Charity,</HI> in not ha&s;tily, ra&s;hly, or too &s;everely judging others, as to look fir&s;t into our own Hearts and Ways, and &s;eeing if we have not the &s;ame, or greater fail|ings. Our <HI>Charity</HI> in this Kind &s;hould begin at home.</Q></P>
<P>GIVE me leave to con&s;ider one <HI>Objection</HI> more, which is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That the denial of our <HI>Judgment</HI> about, or certain <HI>Know|ledge</HI> of Mens &s;piritual <HI>Experiences</HI> and gracious State by them, renders our exerci&s;ing a &s;pecial <HI>love</HI> towards them, impracticable, which is neverthele&s;s a commanded <HI>Duty,</HI> and otherthrows the <HI>Communion</HI> of Saints, which we profe&s;s our belief of in the Apo&s;tles Creed.</P>
<P>I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> That the afore&s;aid Con&s;equencies do not fairly and nece&s;&s;arily follow, becau&s;e our charitable <HI>Hope</HI> concerning the good State of others, grounded on their <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Lives,</HI> is &s;ufficient to excite our &s;pecial Re&s;pect to them as <HI>Brethren,</HI> and Communion with them as &s;uch; and our conferring &s;pecial Kind|ne&s;s upon them, as being of the Hou&s;hold of Faith.</P>
<P>WHAT our Lord a&s;&s;erts, (<HI>Mat.</HI> x. 41, 42.) &s;ufficiently con|firms this; the Words are the&s;e, <HI>He that receiveth a Prophet in the Name of a Prophet, &s;hall receive a Prophets reward; and he that receiveth a righteous Man, in the Name of a righteous Man, &s;hall receive a righteous Man's reward: And who&s;oever &s;hall give to drink unto one of tho&s;e little ones, a Cup of cold Water only, in the Name of a Di&s;ciple, verily I &s;ay unto you, he &s;hall in no wi&s;e loo&s;e his Reward.</HI></P>
<P>NOW to receive them <HI>in the Name of a Prophet, Righteous Man,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;ciple,</HI> is to receive them in <HI>quality</HI> of &s;uch, or <HI>as &s;uch;</HI> not becau&s;e they are rich, powerful, learned, eloquent, or re|lated to us, but becau&s;e they bear the <HI>Character</HI> of <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of CHRIST, or religious Per&s;ons, and appear &s;o to us, by Rea&s;on of their regular Admi&s;&s;ion into the Mini&s;try, Doctrines and Lives; or if of a private Station, by their Principles and Practice only. Now our Lord informs us, that if we be mi&s;taken in our charita|ble <HI>Opinion</HI> of them, and <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> towards them, yet if we have been &s;incere in our <HI>De&s;igns</HI> therein, we &s;hall not mi&s;s a gracious and liberal <HI>Reward,</HI> even for the mo&s;t <HI>minute In&s;tances</HI> of our <HI>Genero&s;ity,</HI> if proportioned to our <HI>ability:</HI> The Lord will look upon &s;uch Kindne&s;&s;es as done to him&s;elf. Thus <HI>Grotius, Mead,</HI> and <HI>Pool,</HI> interpret the afore&s;aid memorable Scripture.</P>
<P>IF it had been the Will of God, that we &s;hould have farther Grounds than I have mentioned, for the performance of the afore|&s;aid
<PB N="66" REF="006423_0073_1028DF4A1706D238">
Duties, he would have expre&s;&s;ed it &s;omewhere in his Word, and enjoined us to &s;eek after it, as well as directed us how to ma|nage &s;o difficult and important an Affair, and given us a Capa|city equal to it, as well as &s;ome Examples (in all probability) of &s;ome pious Men that had attempted to perform this arduous Bu|&s;ine&s;s of <HI>&s;earching</HI> the <HI>Heart;</HI> but of the&s;e Things the Scriptures of Truth, which ought to be the <HI>Rule</HI> of all our Sentiments and Conduct in religious Matters, are entirely &s;ilent, &s;o far as I know, excepting the Ca&s;e of miraculous di&s;cerning, which I have &s;poke of before, and does not concern the ordinary Times and State of the Chri&s;tian Church in Point of Practice.

<P>BY <HI>Schi&s;ms,</HI> the Apo&s;tle means new <HI>Factions, Sects</HI> and <HI>Parties</HI> within the <HI>Church,</HI> whereby it is <HI>torn, Ferments</HI> promoted in its <HI>Bowels,</HI> the Affections of the People uncharitably and unrea&s;ona|bly alienated from each other, not upon the Account of Diffe|rences in E&s;&s;entials of <HI>Doctrine, Wor&s;hip,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> but <HI>cir|cum&s;tantial Matters;</HI> while &s;ome gloried in this, and &s;ome in the other <HI>Patron;</HI> &s;ome <HI>carnally</HI> crying up <HI>Paul,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Apollos,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Cephas,</HI> to the <HI>Di&s;paragement</HI> of each other, and the <HI>Prejudice</HI> of the Church's <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union;</HI> &s;o <HI>Calvin, Beza, Pareus, Grotius,</HI> and <HI>Symachus.</HI></P>
<P>THE Conduct of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> upon this critical Occa&s;ion, was truly amiable, and worthy of a Mini&s;ter of JESUS CHRIST, he refu&s;ed their immoderate <HI>Re&s;pect,</HI> and &s;pake DIMINUTIVELY of HIMSELF, with De&s;ign to &s;top the perilous CAREER of the <HI>Peo|ple,</HI> in making new <HI>Parties, Sects,</HI> and <HI>Factions,</HI> and &s;etting <HI>him|&s;elf</HI> at the <HI>Head</HI> of one of them, he would by no Means accept of &s;uch a fal&s;e <HI>Honour,</HI> to the Prejudice of CHRIST'S <HI>Kingdom,</HI> No! He abhorr'd it! He would rather be condemned and de&s;pis'd by the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> than condemned by GOD, and his own <HI>Mind;</HI> for being the In&s;trument of <HI>uncharitahle Schi&s;ms</HI> and <HI>Factions!</HI></P>
<P>HE therefore nobly ventures his <HI>Character</HI> in the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of GOD, the Cau&s;e of the Church's <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union,</HI> and fearle&s;sly expo&s;es him&s;elf to all the <HI>Fury</HI> of their <HI>Reflections,</HI> for his <HI>Fidelity</HI> to his Ma&s;ter: <HI>Reflections</HI> which were as unrea&s;onable as they were well intended.</P>
<P>THAT ble&s;&s;ed Man, endeavoured to &s;top the violent <HI>Torrent</HI> of <HI>Faction,</HI> by addre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Corinthians</HI> in this humble Language,</P>
<P>BUT <HI>is</HI> CHRIST <HI>divided? Was</HI> Paul <HI>crucified for you? Or were ye baptiz'd in the Name of</HI> Paul? 1 Cor. i. 13. How came the&s;e Parties? There is but one CHRIRT.

<P N="3">3d. LIGAMENT of <HI>Union</HI> with our <HI>Brethren,</HI> is <HI>Peace,</HI> and hence we are commanded to <HI>keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of</HI> PEACE. Without a peaceable Temper and Behaviour, <HI>Union</HI> can neither be obtained, or long pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e I may add the Ob&s;ervance of the <HI>Order</HI> CHRIST has in&s;tituted, and the joint or &s;ocial Performance of religious <HI>Duties,</HI> which the Words <HI>joined together</HI> and <HI>compacted</HI> import, as was ob&s;erved before, which Duties are of noble Tendency to promote and pre&s;erve <HI>Union</HI> among our&s;elves.</P>
<P>FROM all which I would ob&s;erve, that when any of the&s;e Du|ties are neglected, the <HI>Edification</HI> and <HI>Increa&s;e of</HI> CHRIST'S <HI>Body my&s;tical</HI> is <HI>oppos'd</HI> and marr'd.</P>
<P N="4">4.

<P>BUT mu&s;t not we adhere to our former Te&s;timony to Conver|&s;ion?</P>

<P>AND as to our fallible Opinion concerning the late religious Appearances, which is a di&s;tinct Thing from the Doctrine of Conver&s;ion in general; we may and ought to maintain it, but in a con&s;i&s;tency with Peace, Love and Charity.</P>
<P>THERE is a va&s;t difference between our holding our uncertain <HI>Opinion</HI> concerning the <HI>reality</HI> of this or that In&s;tance of Conver|&s;ion, and our impo&s;ing it upon others as a <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Communion,</HI> either Mini&s;terial or Chri&s;tian. Such as are for impo&s;ing their private Opinion about Matters of Liberty, which they cannot cer|tainly

know, of which Kind particular In&s;tances of a Work of Conver&s;ion in any (in our Times) undoubtedly are, as a Term of Church Fellow&s;hip, refu&s;ing to join with them in Communion, until they be of their Sentiment; &s;hould either produce their Charter from the Holy-Scriptures, for &s;uch an extraordinary claim of Power, for &s;uch an unprecedented kind of Proceeding, or at lea&s;t be &s;ilent, if they are not free to do what perhaps they urge upon others, viz. to confe&s;s their <HI>Error</HI> in <HI>Principle,</HI> and <HI>Indi&s;cretion</HI> in <HI>Practice.</HI></P>

<P>IN &s;hort, &s;uch a Sentiment &s;eems to me to be equally contrary to Scripture, Rea&s;on, Antiquity, and the Peace and Union of the Churches of CHRIST.</P>
<P>INASMUCH as good Men may and do differ in Opinion about &s;uch uncertain Things. Witne&s;s the Me&s;&s;rs. the <HI>Er&s;kines</HI> and their followers, with others that might be mentioned.

Be&s;ides as it is an Addition to the <HI>Terms</HI> which the KING of the Church has fix'd, it is an Inva&s;ion of his Royalty, and an Infringement upon our Brothers Liberty.</P>
<P>IS it not unrea&s;onable to make that a <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Communion</HI> which we cannot certainly know, for hereby &s;uch as &s;hould be re|ceived are in Danger of being rejected, as CHRIST him&s;elf ob|&s;erves in his <HI>Parable</HI> of the <HI>Tares.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT <HI>Church</HI> from the Foundation of the World to the pre|&s;ent Times, ever made the open acknowledgment of &s;ome Mens Judgments, concerning the reality of &s;ome In&s;tances of <HI>Conver|&s;ion,</HI> carried on in their Times, without the Te&s;timony of <HI>Mira|cles,</HI> a <HI>Term</HI> of Mini&s;terial <HI>Communion.</HI> I confe&s;s I know of no In&s;tance of this <HI>kind,</HI> in <HI>Scripture,</HI> or <HI>Hi&s;tory.</HI></P>

<P>IS it the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> propos'd in the <HI>Scriptures</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> and in our excellent <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith</HI> agreeable thereto? No! For that is likewi&s;e acknowledged by both the contending Parties.</P>
<P>IS it the <HI>Marks</HI> and <HI>Signs</HI> of <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Scrip|tures?</HI> No! For the&s;e are al&s;o confe&s;&s;ed by Per&s;ons of both Sides.</P>
<P>IS it the <HI>reality</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>In&s;tances</HI> of <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> contained in the <HI>Bible?</HI> No! The divine Authority of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> is equally a&s;&s;erted by both the Parties in Controver&s;y.</P>
<P>IS it whither &s;ome have not been <HI>converted,</HI> in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive <HI>Ages</HI> of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Church,</HI> from the Apo&s;tle's Times to the pre&s;ent Day, and whether &s;ome have not been converted in this <HI>Age,</HI> and in this Part of the World, and whether Good has not been done, and &s;ome effectually changed to all Appearance during the late <HI>Revival</HI> of Religion? No! For the&s;e Things are al&s;o acknowledged.</P>
<P>WHAT is it then that is controverted? Why our Opinion re&s;|pecting the religious <HI>Experiences</HI> of &s;ome in the late Times, and con|cerning the Number of &s;uch; it has been di&s;puted, whether tho&s;e Experiences were of a &s;aving Kind, and whether the Number was &s;o great, as is concluded by &s;ome.</P>
<P>AND is our OPINION concerning what we cannot certainly know, a great Matter think ye?

Conver&s;ion of Sinners, wherever there were any hopeful Ap|pearances of it.</Q>
Mr. <HI>John Thom&s;on,</HI> in their Name, ob&s;erves upon this Head as follows,</P>
<P><Q>IT is true, there are &s;ome Things in our Brethren's Conduct, which we cannot but condemn; and have condemned and &s;poken again&s;t both in private and publick; and &s;ome Things al&s;o which are the frequent Effects of their Preaching on many of their Hearers, which we cannot &s;o highly e&s;teem of, as both they and their Admirers do.</Q> Among which he mentions <HI>crying out aloud</HI> in the mid&s;t of the Congregation, in the Time of pub|lick Wor&s;hip; and others <HI>falling down</HI> half dead, or working like Per&s;ons in Convul&s;ion Fits.

<Q>It is true, &s;ince our <HI>Brethren</HI> have thus <HI>intine|rated,</HI> there are, as I am informed and partly <HI>know,</HI> a <HI>great many</HI> who are &s;tirred up to have more <HI>&s;erious Thoughts</HI> about their <HI>Soul</HI>'s Concerns than ever they had before; which is a Thing truly to be <HI>rejoiced in;</HI> and many, it's &s;aid, are much re|formed, in &s;everal Particulars of moral Practice, which al&s;o is ju&s;t <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Satisfaction;</HI> may the Lord grant that it may be more and more &s;o.</Q> And el&s;ewhere he &s;peaks in the following Chri&s;tian-like humble Strain,
<Q>As to the general Complaint which Mr. <HI>Blair</HI> in his Introduction makes, concerning the low State of Religion, and experimental Godline&s;s, and the Influence which the Negligence and Remi&s;ne&s;s, of <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> in the Du|ties of their <HI>Office</HI> and Station, have upon the &s;ame, I <HI>acknow|ledge</HI> that I believe there is too much Ground for it; and that it is ju&s;t Matter of Mourning and Lamentation, to all who have the <HI>Welfare</HI> of <HI>Zyon,</HI> and Pro&s;perity of Souls at their Heart; yea, I am firmly per&s;uaded, that our Barrenne&s;s and Fuitle&s;&s;ne&s;s under the Means of Grace, the Decay of vital Godline&s;s in both Mini&s;ters and People, our too great Ea&s;e and Contented|ne&s;s with a lifele&s;s, lukewarm Orthodoxy of Profe&s;&s;ion, is one principal Evil whereby our GOD hath been provoked again&s;t us, to &s;uffer us to fall into &s;uch <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Confu&s;ions,</HI> as we are now vi&s;ibly involv'd in.

<Q>However, <HI>we rejoice</HI> that the great GOD, who over rules all Events for his own Glory, and the Good of his Church, doth make the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> preach'd by the&s;e <HI>Brethren, effectual</HI> in many, to &s;tir them up to a more &s;erious Con&s;ideration of their Soul-Concerns, than ever before.

And having made mention of &s;everal prevailing Evils, he &s;ays,
<Q>Nei|ther is it to be doubted, but that we who are in the Mini&s;try, are in no &s;mall Degree ju&s;tly chargeable with the Guilt of the&s;e Evils, on various Accounts; by our per&s;onal Guilt of tho&s;e a|bounding Sins; by our not bearing Te&s;timony again&s;t them with that Zeal the Ca&s;e requires, both doctrinarily and in a di&s;ciplinary Way; by our not mourning over them, and la|menting with due &s;orrow of Heart before the Lord; by our too lax and untender walk in our own private Conver&s;ation; by our being too Carnal in our conver&s;ing with our People and one another.&mdash;And farther I think it not unlikely that God in his infinite Wi&s;dom, hath permitted our <HI>Brethren,</HI> who appear to be &s;o MUCH MORE ZEALOUS then WE for carrying on a WORK of CONVERSION&mdash;which they apprehend is wholly ne|glected by us, as it is indeed too much, to be In&s;truments in the Lord's Hands to cha&s;ti&s;e us for our neglects and &s;hort comings.</Q></P>
<P>NOW &s;eeing the Reverend Mr. <HI>John Thom&s;on</HI> appeared as the <HI>Appologi&s;t</HI> of the pre&s;ent SYNOD of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> it may be rea|&s;onably pre&s;um'd, that he &s;peaks the Mind of at lea&s;t the gene|rality of that Body; and therefore it is evident from the afore|&s;aid Pa&s;&s;ages, that they were far from oppo&s;ing (with De&s;ign) the late REVIVAL of RELIGION; that on the contrary they expre&s;ly ACKNOWLEDGED it, REJOYC'D in it, and PRAY'D for its INCREASE; yea and in &s;everal In&s;tances as HUMBLY as PUB|LICKLY ACKNOWLEDG'D their own Imperfections in Rela|tion to the pre&s;ent Debate.

&s;uch a <HI>pacifick Temper,</HI> as the very Reverend Dr. <HI>Bates</HI> a&s;cribes to excellent Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> in his Funeral Sermon, in the following Words,
<Q>His pacifick Spirit was a clear Character of his being a Child of God. How ardently he endeavour'd to <HI>cement</HI> the <HI>Breaches</HI> among us, which others widen and keep open, is pub|lickly known. He &s;aid to a Friend, I can as willingly be a Martyr for LOVE as for any Article of the Creed. 'Tis &s;trange to a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;aith the Doctor, that tho&s;e who agree in the &s;ub&s;tantial and great Points of the reform'd Religion, and are of differing Sentiments only in Things not &s;o clear, nor of that moment as the&s;e wherein they con&s;ent, &s;hould &s;till be oppo|&s;ite Parties. Methinks the Remembrance how our Divi&s;ions lately expos'd us to our watchful Adver&s;ary, and were almo&s;t fatal to the Intere&s;t of Religion, &s;hould conciliate our Affections. Our common Danger and common Deliverance &s;hould prepare our Spirits for a &s;incere and firm Union. Integrity, with Charity, would remove tho&s;e Things that have &s;o long di&s;united us.</Q>
What Dr. <HI>Bates</HI> ob&s;erves, is agreable to that excellent <HI>Maxim, in nece&s;&s;ariis unitas, in non nece&s;&s;ariis Libertas, in omnibus charitas.</HI> In fundamentals Unity, in circum&s;tantials Liberty, and in all Things Charity. O its pity that this does not univer&s;ally obtain among the Children of Men!</P>
<P>BUT are we not enjoined to <HI>turn away from tho&s;e that have Form of Godline&s;s, but deny the Power thereof,</HI> (2 Tim. iii. 5.)</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, tho&s;e whom the Apo&s;tle advi&s;es <HI>Timothy</HI> to turn away from, were both <HI>prophane</HI> in <HI>Practice,</HI> and <HI>heretical</HI> in <HI>Sentiment:</HI> for thus he de&s;cribes them in the Context, <HI>covetouus, boa&s;ters, proud, bla&s;phemers, di&s;obedient to Parents, unthankful, unholy, with|out natural Affection, (a&s;pondei make bates)</HI> &s;uch as will be held by no Bonds, or rather as the Word is tran&s;lated, <HI>Rom.</HI> i. 31. <HI>im|placable,</HI> Men &s;o full of Malice, that they will admit of no Terms of <HI>Peace.

<P>BUT, why then are they &s;aid to have a Form of Godline&s;s? <HI>(Morpho&s;in)</HI> a <HI>Ma&s;k</HI> or Vi&s;or.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, they had in it <HI>Speech</HI> in Pretence, but not in <HI>Practice</HI> or Power; they pretended to a right Way of wor&s;hipping GOD, and to be the only true Church; and this was all: And therefore ac|cording to the Rules of the Go&s;pel, they were not fit Per|&s;ons to a&s;&s;ociate with.</P>
<P>BUT was not the Prophet enjoined to <HI>take forth the Precious from the Vile?</HI></P>
<P>ANSWER, Yes: That is, &s;aith <HI>Pool,</HI>
<Q>He was to &s;eparate the precious <HI>Truths</HI> of GOD, from the vile <HI>Conceits</HI> of <HI>Men;</HI> or rather to preach &s;o, as to di&s;tingui&s;h good and bad Men from one another.</Q>

<P>WHEN there is a Breach of <HI>Union</HI> in a <HI>Society,</HI> &s;hould not that Party that is mo&s;t in the right, tarry, till the other &s;ue for Peace?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer with Mr. <HI>Durham,</HI> No: The more they are in the Right, and the le&s;s Need they have of Peace upon their own ac|count, the more &s;elf-denying and noble are their innocent humble Conde&s;centions, their early and earne&s;t <HI>Suits</HI> for <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> for GOD'S &s;ake, and for his <HI>Kingdom</HI>'s &s;ake, and not for their <HI>own!</HI> The <HI>Religion</HI> of JESUS, is not a bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Pride,</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> or <HI>Stoutne&s;s,</HI> (that hangs on haughty <HI>Ceremony</HI>) but of <HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Self-denial;</HI> the more of the&s;e Graces we have, and exerci&s;e, the more we imitate the ble&s;&s;ed IMANUEL, and the more we partake of, and expre&s;s the <HI>Spirit</HI> of his <HI>Religion,</HI> and conform to its important aad truly noble <HI>De&s;ign.</HI> Surely as <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>It is a Glory to pa&s;s over a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but for Men to &s;earch their own Glory, it not Glory. He that hath no Rule over his own Spirit, is like a City that is broken down, and without Walls, but he that is &s;tow to Anger is better than the Mighty; and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City.</HI></P>
<P>IF it be &s;aid, that there is no Nece&s;&s;ity of this <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union,</HI> we are well enough as we are.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that there is always a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Obedience</HI> to GOD'S commanding <HI>Authority,</HI> nor are we ever well, but while we endea|vour to comply therewith. Now is it not the Command of GOD, that we &s;hould <HI>pray for the Peace of</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace?</HI> If we &s;hould keep <HI>Unity</HI> when we have it, &s;hould not we labour to recover it when it is lo&s;t?</P>
<P>BUT perhaps &s;ome may object, to this Purpo&s;e, that to join with a Company of dead Men, is the ready way to make us deader than we are.</P>
<P>ANSWER, It is cruel and cen&s;orious Judging, to condemn the States of tho&s;e we know not; and to condemn po&s;itively and openly the &s;piritual <HI>States</HI> of &s;uch as are &s;ound in <HI>fundamental Doctrines,</HI> and <HI>regular in Life.</HI> The Way to obtain quickning Grace, is the Path of <HI>Duty,</HI> and not the &s;candalous Practice of that God-provoking and Church-rendring <HI>Iniquity</HI> RASH-JUDGING, this may quicken indeed, but not to any Thing that is good: but to <HI>Back-biting, Slandering, Wrath, Malignity,</HI> and all Manner of Mi&s;chief! O! that a gracious GOD would open the Eyes of the Children of Men, to &s;ee the inexpre&s;&s;ible Ba&s;ene&s;s and Horrors of this dete&s;table IMPIETY, that is pregnant with inumerable <HI>Evils!</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, it may be objected, that we are enjoined in divers Places of Scripture, to beware of <HI>Wolves</HI> in Sheep's cloathing, of <HI>Dogs,</HI> of <HI>Foxes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

they will be found to re&s;pect in my OPINION, primarily, princi|pally and directly <HI>erroneous</HI> and <HI>heretical Teachers,</HI> &s;uch may be known, and &s;uch &s;hould be with Care avoided; but to <HI>&s;eparate</HI> from &s;uch as are &s;ound in e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary Articles, of Faith, regular in Life, and edifying in their Mini&s;try, meerly or only be|cau&s;e they differ from us in &s;ome circum&s;tantial Points which they do not impo&s;e, or are judg'd by us to be unregenerate, is uncha|ritable, un&s;criptural, and of dangerous Tendency! As this Prac|tice wants a divine <HI>Warrant,</HI> &s;o it puts the Peace and Union of the vi&s;ible Church of CHRIST, upon a very uncertain and pre|carious <HI>Bottom,</HI> and opens a <HI>Door</HI> to inumerable mi&s;chevious and &s;candalous <HI>Rents</HI> and <HI>Divi&s;ions!</HI> And if it be &s;inful to make a Breach on &s;uch a Foundation, (which has been ever my Opinion, tho' now I confe&s;s, thro' GOD'S Mercy, I have a more di&s;tinct and enlarged View of the Ca&s;e than formerly,) it mu&s;t needs be &s;o to keep up the <HI>Breach,</HI> to neglect or refu&s;e rea&s;onable <HI>Over|tures</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> upon &s;uch a Foundation.</P>
<P>IF it be farther &s;aid, that the <HI>Church</HI> is now in a cold <HI>declining State,</HI> and that when there was more <HI>Liveline&s;s,</HI> and more Good done, no Propo&s;als of <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>Union</HI> were made, nor was there any Pro&s;pect of it.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, the <HI>Church</HI> is now in its ordinary <HI>State,</HI> in which Men being <HI>calm,</HI> can be&s;t examine and judge concerning the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> altho' not &s;o many are alarmed out of their <HI>Security,</HI> as &s;ome Time &s;ince, yet thro' divine <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> &s;ome are awakened and to Appearance <HI>converted;</HI> and the <HI>Body</HI> of CHRIST is <HI>edify'd,</HI> for which there is great Cau&s;e of Thankfulne&s;s.

<P>IF there is not &s;o much Appearance of <HI>Zeal</HI> among Profe&s;&s;ors at pre&s;ent, as formerly, yet I tru&s;t it has this valuable &s;uperior advantage, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is more <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing,</HI> at lea&s;t in &s;ome and better <HI>tempered</HI> with <HI>Humility, Meek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;s</HI> and <HI>Love.</HI> Is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le grain of &s;olid <HI>Gold</HI> preferable to a great lump of <HI>Bra&s;s,</HI> that has &s;ome mixture of Gold in it, notwith&s;tanding its &s;uperior <HI>bulk</HI> and <HI>&s;howy Appearance!</HI> Much <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>wild-fire,</HI> much <HI>un|merciful ra&s;hne&s;s</HI> and <HI>&s;everity</HI> &s;ometimes attend the <HI>Zeal</HI> of <HI>young Converts,</HI> who are Ignorant and of a pa&s;&s;ionate Temper, which it is a favour to be delivered from, thro' farther acquaintance with our&s;elves, by a <HI>variety</HI> of <HI>Tryals,</HI> outward and inward. Nor is it any Argument of <HI>coldne&s;s</HI> or <HI>decays</HI> in <HI>Religion,</HI> to have that fiery, furious <HI>fiercene&s;s</HI> again&s;t others, &s;oftned and qualified with <HI>Charity, Meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Mercy;</HI> but of the Contrary, namely, of <HI>real</HI> advances in true <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> whatever its mi&s;guided <HI>vo|taries</HI> pretend to the Contrary notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>BUT if we are in any Mea&s;ure grown <HI>cold,</HI> the be&s;t way to obtain quickning, is to <HI>obey</HI> the ble&s;&s;ed GOD in <HI>praying</HI> and <HI>&s;triv|ing,</HI> as much as in us lies, for the <HI>Peace</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> The <HI>Path</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary Truths, is certainly the Way which God him&s;elf has chaulk'd out, to obtain that quickning which is of the right Kind.</P>

<P>IT may be again objected, that <HI>Paul</HI> being beaten publickly by the Magi&s;trates, uncondemn'd declined to go out of the Pri&s;on privately, till they came and fetched him, (<HI>Act.</HI> xvi. 37.)</P>
<P>I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> That in Order to under&s;tand this Scripture aright, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that by the <HI>Porcian</HI> and <HI>Sempronian</HI> Laws, it was utterly unlawful to beat a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen unle&s;s the Sentence of Death had been pronounced upon him; and &s;till more &s;o when the beating was publick, and the Cau&s;e unheard; &s;o <HI>Cicero, He&s;iod, Appuleius,</HI> and <HI>Tertulian</HI> Witne&s;s, with many others.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the Con&s;titution of &s;aid Laws, when a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen was wronged, the Maje&s;ty of the <HI>Roman</HI> People was reckon'd to be wronged or les'd, &s;ays <HI>Grotius.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the <HI>Pagan</HI> Magi&s;trates of <HI>Philippi,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony, being &s;tirred up by the Clamours of the People, broke the afore|&s;aid Laws in ordering <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> to be beaten publickly and impri&s;on'd, who were not condemn'd to Death, being ignorant they were Roman Citizens: The Apo&s;tle knowing that when the Magi&s;trates came to under&s;tand this, they would be terrified with the Apprehen&s;ion of incurring the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire for &s;o manife&s;t a Violation of their Laws, (<HI>Act.</HI> xxii. 29) and therefore ready to come into &s;ome Conde&s;centions to prevent it; prudently declined going out of Pri&s;on directly, in a private manner as they were de&s;ired, and in&s;i&s;ted on the Magi&s;trates com|ing them&s;elves and bringing them out, alledging that they were <HI>Romans.</HI> This the Apo&s;tle probably did to prevent future Seve|rities of the like Kind; and partly to vindicate their Characters from the Imputation of Crimes that demerited &s;uch &s;candalous corporal Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>GROTIUS ob&s;erves ju&s;tly, that <HI>Paul</HI> knew how to u&s;e the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Laws for the Defence of Inocence and a good Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT can any Body think, that the Apo&s;tle wou'd have &s;tay'd &s;ome Years in Pri&s;on, when he had Liberty to go out in Ca&s;e the Magi&s;trates had delayed their coming &s;o long. No! Surely.</P>
<P>IN a Word, we are to learn from this In&s;tance, the nece&s;&s;ity of human <HI>Prudence,</HI> e&s;pecially in Affairs of a civil Nature, and therefore it is foreign to the Point in Debate: The ca&s;es are not parallel, which appears thus, in the one, the Per&s;ons Offending were Pagan <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> the <HI>Offence</HI> was upon <HI>one &s;ide only,</HI> the Offence was of a <HI>civil Nature,</HI> depriving the Apo&s;tle of the right of a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen: The Offence was committed again&s;t the
<PB N="94" REF="006423_0101_1028DFBA6800D840">
civil Laws of the Land, as well as again&s;t the Law of Nature di|rectly. But in the other Ca&s;e, the Per&s;ons offending are <HI>Brethren,</HI> of the &s;acred Character, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame fundamental Princi|ples of the Chri&s;tian Religion; the <HI>Offences</HI> are not again&s;t the civil Laws of the Land, nor again&s;t the Law of Nature, (directly) but have been occa&s;ioned by difference in Opinion about Circum|&s;tantials in Religion; the Offences have been mutual in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree, in Matter or Manner of management; the Offences are not properly of a civil Nature.</P>
<P>NOW &s;eeing the <HI>Ca&s;es</HI> are not <HI>parallel,</HI> no ju&s;t inference can be drawn from the one to the other, of deffering Endeavours after Peace and Union, until the Party that is mo&s;t in the fault, come fir&s;t into &s;ome Conde&s;cen&s;ions in order to it; and indeed as it is in it&s;elf unju&s;t to draw the &s;ame Conclu&s;ion from different Premi&s;es, &s;o it likewi&s;e makes the Apo&s;tle contradict him&s;elf, for in the 14th Chap. of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> he exhorts Parties contending about Circum&s;tantials, to come into a Peace and Union without &s;uch Preliminaries; nor is it rea&s;onable that any one &s;hould ne|glect his Duty becau&s;e another neglects his; for if &s;o, he may po&s;&s;ibly neglect it during Life, and thus make void the Law and yet be guiltle&s;s. But &s;uppo&s;ing the Ca&s;es were parallel, the afore|&s;aid In&s;tance would not conclude, for there has been a delay al|ready of &s;everal Years, and we do not know that the Apo&s;tle delay'd &s;o much as one Day</P>
<P>BUT don't mi&s;take me, I am for <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union,</HI> tho' I in&s;i&s;t upon Acknowledgment.</P>
<P>I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> It may be &s;o in <HI>Words</HI> and <HI>Intention,</HI> but not in <HI>Deed.</HI> Is it not very incon&s;i&s;tent in a Ca&s;e of Debate of a long Conti|nuance, wherein are mutual complaints of Mi&s;conduct, flowing from a difference of Sentiment in le&s;&s;er Things, for one of the Par|ties to urge Acknowledgment, and yet pretend <HI>Peace,</HI> &s;eeing it di|rectly tends to renew the War? For the Right of <HI>Self-Vindication</HI> is equal upon both Sides; and if one has a right to require Ac|knowledgment, &s;o has the other, and doubtle&s;s will in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; for &s;elf-love is common to all, and a due Degree of it is but rea&s;onable. This &s;evere Method therefore of cour&s;e brings upon the Carpet all the dormant Controver&s;ies that have been between the contending Parties, and loudly &s;ummons them to War and Arms, both offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive: This excites them re&s;pectively to defend their own Conduct, and to charge and re|criminate upon the others; and hence the Churches <HI>Wounds</HI> are like to <HI>bleed</HI> afre&s;h, and the <HI>Breach</HI> in&s;tead of being healed will be widen'd: For how can Men, with a good Con&s;cience, acknow|ledge that to be wrong which they don't &s;ee to be wrong? And where has God obliged us upon pain of Exclu&s;ion from Church fellow&s;hip, to be of one Opinion in every little Thing? And thus in this Way, the Churches Peace and Union are like to be perpetually prevented. Now can we &s;uppo&s;e rea&s;onably that the All-wi&s;e God in order to promote <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> (in a Ca&s;e

For by the &s;ame Rule that one <HI>circum&s;tantial</HI> of human Invention is made a <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Communion,</HI> a Thou&s;and may be made; and then what will become of the Churches <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union?</HI></P>
<P>BUT do not we by coming into a <HI>Union</HI> without <HI>Acknowledg|ment,</HI> give up the Work of GOD?</P>
<P>I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> No. We do and may retain our Opinion concern|ing it till Death, only we do not make it a <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Communion</HI> to others, for which we have no Authority in the Scriptures. Did the in&s;pir'd Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> advi&s;e the <HI>Gentile</HI> Chri&s;tians to give up the Truths re&s;pecting <HI>Liberty,</HI> for which they contended, when he exhorted them to receive the <HI>Jews</HI> to <HI>Communion,</HI> that deny'd them? If yea, then the <HI>Bible</HI> is wrong! For the afore&s;aid <HI>Ad|vice</HI> is of the &s;ame Original with the re&s;t of the Scriptures. If nay, the Objection vani&s;hes! If every Thing we believe mu&s;t be made a <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Communion,</HI> or it is given up, there can be no Church on Earth, becau&s;e there can &s;carce be found any that are agreed in every Thing.</P>
<P>IF it be &s;aid, that oppo&s;ing the late <HI>revival</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> is wor&s;e than open <HI>Immorality.</HI></P>
<P>I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> It is a great <HI>mi&s;take,</HI> which appears thus, all mu&s;t acknowledge that <HI>Sins</HI> again&s;t <HI>light,</HI> are wor&s;e then tho&s;e that flow from <HI>Ignorance</HI> or <HI>Mi&s;take;</HI> becau&s;e there is a greater <HI>con|tempt</HI> of God's <HI>Authority</HI> in them, than in the other. <HI>If I had not come and told them, they would not have had Sin, but now their Sin remains; now they have no Cloak for their Sins.</HI> This ge|neral &s;elf evident <HI>Maxim</HI> ea&s;ily applies it&s;elf thus, <HI>gro&s;s Iniquities</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> are again&s;t the <HI>light</HI> of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> which is common to all, and hard, if po&s;&s;ible, to be quite extingui&s;h'd,

and therefore they are heinious, and admit of no <HI>Apology.</HI> But <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> to the late <HI>revival of Religion,</HI> might, and we have Rea&s;on in Charity to <HI>believe,</HI> it flow'd from <HI>Mi&s;take,</HI> about a Matter, comparitively, doubtful, not di&s;coverable by the meer <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> namely, the inward <HI>Experiences</HI> of &s;ome of a work of <HI>Conver&s;ion;</HI> which the be&s;t of Men may, and generally are at lea&s;t in &s;ome In&s;tances, mi&s;taken about, and more e&s;pecially when they are under any <HI>Temptation</HI> by hard <HI>U&s;uage,</HI> and other Incidents. It is true, if they did it again&s;t clear Light and Con|viction to the Contrary, it would be a dreadful <HI>Evil;</HI> but none can &s;ay this in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, except they take upon them the peculiar <HI>Province</HI> of GOD, to <HI>judge</HI> the &s;ecret <HI>Thoughts</HI> of the <HI>Heart,</HI> and break the Law of <HI>Charity,</HI> both which heinous Evils, we &s;hould with equal Care avoid.</P>

I believe indeed that tho&s;e that urge <HI>Acknowledg|ments,</HI> have no &s;uch <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> have no &s;uch <HI>view</HI> of the <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> but this is the real Language of the <HI>Principle,</HI> the true State of the Matter.

<P>IT is true, the <HI>Major Party</HI> may be mi&s;taken as well as the <HI>Minor,</HI> and con&s;equently abu&s;e their <HI>Power,</HI> for which there is no help in the pre&s;ent imperfect State of Things, but humble Remon&s;trating by Rea&s;on and Argument: Yet con&s;ider'd as a <HI>Society,</HI> the Majority have a right to <HI>judge</HI> for them&s;elves, (upon the <HI>Plan</HI> of private Judgment) what they reckon <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to their <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> or to the <HI>well-being</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> under their Care, and con&s;equently to exclude from their Society &s;uch as do not comply therewith.</P>

<P>NO doubt tho&s;e great <HI>Bodies</HI> of religious <HI>People,</HI> that &s;o fiercely contended in the <HI>primitive Times,</HI> about <HI>Ea&s;ter-Day;</HI> look'd upon it to be a <HI>Point</HI> of the la&s;t <HI>Moment,</HI> for they were &s;o violent and <HI>furious</HI> upon the <HI>Matter,</HI> that they were deaf to <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Ar|gument,</HI> they would not regard all the &s;ober <HI>Rea&s;onings</HI> of pious peaceful <HI>Irenius</HI> and others for <HI>Accommodation,</HI> but with ob&s;tinate and unrelenting <HI>Fury,</HI> proceeded to the dreadful <HI>Sentence</HI> of <HI>Excommunication</HI> again&s;t each other.</P>

<P>THAT the Promi&s;e afore&s;aid does extend to Go&s;pel Times, appears, as I apprehend, from the following Con&s;iderations. viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. BECAUSE the Completion it had among the <HI>Jews</HI> was but &s;mall; there were but few that return'd from the <HI>Babiloni&s;h Captivity,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;aith <HI>Junius.</HI></P>

Lord JESUS CHRIST. <HI>John</HI> xvii. 21. <HI>That all may be one, that they al&s;o may be</HI> ONE in us, <HI>that the World may believe that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me, that is, that Strangers to Chri&s;tianity by behold|ing the Love of tho&s;e that profe&s;s it, to each other, and</HI> UNION AMONG THEMSELVES, which is the proper Con&s;equent of it; may be convinced of my divine Mi&s;&s;ion, and induced to receive the Declarations I have made to Men, in pur&s;uance of it; or in other Words, that they may receive my <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI></P>

<P>ANOTHER remarkable <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> we have in <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvii 19. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, behold I will take the Stick of</HI> Jo&s;eph, <HI>which is in the Hand of</HI> Ephraim, <HI>and the Tribes of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>his Fellows, and will put them with him even with the Stick of</HI> Judah, <HI>and make them one Stick, and they &s;hall become one in my Hand.</HI></P>
<P>THERE had been a <HI>Breach</HI> of <HI>Union,</HI> and unhappy <HI>Animo&s;ities</HI> con&s;equent thereupon, between the two Kingdoms of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> who were <HI>Bretbren,</HI> and but <HI>one Kingdom</HI> before the fatal <HI>Breach,</HI> after which upon all Occa&s;ions, <HI>Ephraim envied Judah,</HI> and on the other Hand <HI>Judah vexed Ephraim:</HI> But here it is promi&s;ed, that that divided State, which was &s;o uncomfortable to, and un&s;afe for both, &s;hould continue no longer, but that there &s;hould be a happy, a comfortable <HI>Coalition</HI> between them, di&s;po&s;ing them to bury former <HI>Offences,</HI> and angry Contentions in the <HI>Grave</HI> of per|petual <HI>Oblivion,</HI> and for the future only contend who &s;hould <HI>love</HI> one another mo&s;t, and excel in the <HI>humble</HI> but amiable <HI>Offices</HI> of mutual <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Endearment!</HI></P>

<P>NOW altho' this Promi&s;e, has a primary and direct Referrence to the <HI>Jews,</HI> yet undoubtedly it extends farther, even to the <HI>Union</HI> of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> into one <HI>Church,</HI> under the <HI>Go&s;pel-Oeconomy;</HI> profe&s;&s;ing one <HI>Lord, one Faith, one Bapti&s;m,</HI> and is very applicable to a <HI>re-union</HI> of <HI>Brethren,</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Sentiments</HI> into one <HI>Body</HI> or religious <HI>Community.</HI></P>
<P>UNCHARITAPLE <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> and Separations on account of Cir|cum&s;tantials, or le&s;&s;er Things (not impos'd) among tho&s;e that pro|fe&s;s the &s;ame <HI>fundamentals</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> is a crim&s;on Iniquity, at|tended with mo&s;t awful Aggravations!</P>
<P>THEY are exceeding contrary to the very <HI>Nature</HI> of GOD, who is Love, as has been before ob&s;erved: <HI>Love</HI> is the Perfection of all Grace, the End of all Duties, the mo&s;t excellent Way, the Work of Heaven, the new Commandment, the Imitation of the be&s;t of Beings, and a principal mean to obtain and maintain a Communion with him. <HI>He that loves, dwells in God, and God in him, for God is Love.</HI></P>
<P>UNCHARITABLE <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> are exceeding contrary to the whole <HI>Law</HI> and Word of GOD, which is fufill'd by <HI>Love,</HI> and e&s;peci|ally to that expre&s;s <HI>Precept</HI> which enjoins us to <HI>keep the</HI> Unity <HI>of the</HI> Spirit, <HI>in the Bond of</HI> Peace.</P>
<P>NOR are they le&s;s contrary to the whole <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of GOD, which is a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing Di&s;play of the divine <HI>Love</HI> and Good|ne&s;s, in all it's Glory, Riches, Charms, and Conde&s;cen&s;ions, and

Ephe&s;. ii. 15.) Farther,</P>
<P>UNCHARITABLE Divi&s;ions are exceeding contrary to the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Work</HI> of GOD. They oppo&s;e the Work of God the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> in our own Souls, and in the Souls of others, in its Nature, De&s;ign, and Tendency. <HI>By one Spirit,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>we are all baptized into one Body, whether</HI> Jew <HI>or</HI> Gentile, <HI>bond or free; and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.</HI> (1 Cor. xii. 13.) The Nature and Tendency of the <HI>Work</HI> of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of God, in our own and others Souls, is <HI>Love, Peace, Unity:</HI> And hence the two former are called the <HI>Fruits of the Spi|rit,</HI> (Gal. v. 22.) and the latter is called the <HI>Unity of the Spirit,</HI> (Ephe&s;. iv. 24) And the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> are &s;aid to be <HI>taught of God to love one another,</HI> (1 The&s;&s;. iv. 9.) Hence you may &s;ee, that tho&s;e who promote uncharitable <HI>Divi&s;ions,</HI> oppo&s;e (tho' not with De&s;ign) not only the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, but likewi&s;e the <HI>Work</HI> of GOD in their own Souls, and in the Souls of others: By pro|voking their angry Re&s;entments &s;infully, they fight again&s;t the Nature, Spirit and Genius of Conver&s;ion to God, and real Chri&s;tianity.

<P>UNCHARITABLE <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> are exceeding contrary to the <HI>Or|dinances</HI> of GOD, viz. <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> the Word preach'd, and the LORD'S <HI>Supper,</HI> the De&s;ign of which is to procure and pre&s;erve the <HI>Unity</HI> of his <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>BY <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> Per&s;ons are added to the Church (Acts ii. and 1 Cor, xii. 12, 13.) <HI>For as the Body is one and hath many Members, and all the Members of that one Body; &s;o al&s;o is</HI> CHTIST; that is, <HI>Chri&s;t Mi&s;tical,</HI> or the vi&s;ible Church which is his Body: The Rea&s;on of which <HI>Union</HI> in the Church of CHRIST, or <HI>mean</HI> to procure it is <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> for &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, by one <HI>Spirit</HI> we are all <HI>Baptized</HI>

<P>BY the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> as the in&s;pired writer ob&s;erves, <HI>we are one Bread, and one Body, tho' we be many, for we are all partakers of that one Bread,</HI> (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 17.) i. e.

In a Word uncharitable <HI>Divi&s;ions,</HI> tend not only to ob&s;truct all good <HI>Di&s;po&s;itions</HI> in our own Souls, but to promote evil <HI>Affections,</HI> corrupt <HI>Principles,</HI> and all Manner of <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> in Life, for <HI>where Envying</HI> (or <HI>Zeal, Zelos) and Strife are,</HI> i. e. envying Zeal, <HI>there is Confu&s;ion and every evil Work.</HI> (Jam. iii. 16.) Again,</P>
<P>UNCHARITABLE <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> do al&s;o hinder the <HI>Progre&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in the World, and ob&s;truct the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of poor <HI>Sinners</HI> to the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, and thereby their eternal <HI>Salvation:</HI> For what Encouragement have they to be religious, while the Church is torn by <HI>Divi&s;ions,</HI> into &s;o great a Number of Parts and Parties, (divers of whom do cruelly condemn all but tho&s;e of their own way) that they do not know what <HI>Religion</HI> or Profe&s;&s;ion to be of? O! this is a melancholy Ca&s;e, which de&s;erves to be la|mented, if it were po&s;&s;ible, with Tears of Blood.</P>

<P>IN Confirmation of which the Words of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians</HI> chap v. ver. 15. are remarkable, <HI>but if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not con|&s;umed one of another,</HI> i. e. beware that you do not wound or tear one another, by Words pointed with Envy and Calumny, and by injurious Deeds; lea&s;t the I&s;&s;ue thereof &s;hould terminate in your mutual Overthrow, and final Ruin! lea&s;t that GOD who <HI>is a con&s;uming Fire,</HI> &s;hould be provoked by your <HI>Impiety</HI> to &s;end de&s;olating <HI>Calamities</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wift <HI>De&s;truction.</HI> There is doubtle&s;s an Allu&s;ion in the Words, <HI>bite</HI> and <HI>devour</HI> to the ill-natur'd <HI>Snarl|ing</HI> and furious <HI>Biteing</HI> of DOGS, for the&s;e Things are indeed more becoming &s;uch bruti&s;h &s;avage <HI>Animals</HI> than Men &amp; <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>AND hence the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, in the 14th, 16th, 17th, and 20th Ver&s;es of the &s;ame Chapter, that the whole Will of GOD, containing our Duty towards Men, is reducible to this one thing LOVE; for whatever the Almighty requires towards them, is but a Branch from this Root, a Stream from this <HI>Fountain; The End of the Commandment, is Charity out of a pure Heart, and Faith un|feigned:</HI> The contrary to which, <HI>viz.

from <HI>Schi&s;m,</HI> which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in an <HI>uncharitable Allienation of Mind from our Brethren:</HI> And hence the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of <HI>Schi&s;ms</HI> among the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> who met at the &s;ame Sacramental Table. <HI>Chillingworth, Hales,</HI> and Dr. <HI>H.

<P>SOME draw an Objection again&s;t <HI>Union</HI> from the&s;e Words of GOD to the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> (chap. xv. 19, 20.) <HI>Let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them, and I will make thee unto this People a fenced brazen Wall, and they &s;hall fight again&s;t thee, but they &s;hall not prevail again&s;t thee.</HI></P>
<P>ANSWER, I think Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> gives us the true meaning of the afore&s;aid Place of Scripture, in the&s;e Words, <Q>He chargeth the Prophet to keep his ground and not to go over unto wicked Men, but to u&s;e his endeavour to reduce them to that Obedience he yielded to him,</Q> Do not flatter them or con|form to their Evil Practice, but labour to reclaim them and bring them under the Yoke of God, declare faithfully what I have commanded thee; to this Effect &s;peak <HI>Calvin, Junius</HI> and <HI>Gro|tius.</HI> So that what is forbidden, is a criminal Neglect of Duty, a criminal Compliance with, or conformity to what is <HI>Evil;</HI> but to &s;eek <HI>Peace</HI> with, and <HI>Union</HI> to our Brethren, who hold the &s;ame Foundation Principles, and are regular in Life, is &s;o far from being Evil, that it is po&s;itively commanded: Hence it appears, that the Text afore&s;aid, is foreign to the Point for which it is aduced. To take the afore&s;aid Scripture in any o|ther Sen&s;e than I have given of it, makes it contradict many po&s;itive divine Precepts, which enjoin us to <HI>en&s;ue Peace, to leave our Gift at the Altar, and go fir&s;t and be reconciled to our Bro|ther;</HI> and therefore any other Sen&s;e of the Text cannot be true, for GOD cannot command Contradictions.</P>
<P>IN reading the late <HI>Chri&s;tian Hi&s;tory,</HI> compo&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> I could not but ob&s;erve in the Accounts he gives of many Reverend Mini&s;ters of <HI>New-England,</HI> who favour'd the late revival of Religion, that notwith&s;tanding of their <HI>Zeal</HI> for that ble&s;&s;ed Work of the mo&s;t high God, they &s;till retained charitable Sentiments of their Brethren, who differed from them in Opinion upon that Head, and &s;poke honourably of them: This is an Example well worthy of our Imitation, which may it plea&s;e the God of Peace and Love, to encline and enable us all to conform to.</P>

<P>TO &s;uppo&s;e that your <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> or <HI>joining</HI> in publick <HI>Ordinances,</HI> makes you <HI>Guilty</HI> without your <HI>Con&s;ent,</HI> is ridiculous Non&s;en&s;e: For at this Rate, as was hinted before, all &s;ocial Wor&s;hip mu&s;t be de&s;troy'd. For if by joining in Communion with them in out|ward Ordinances, we are, contrary to our <HI>Con&s;ent,</HI> made parta|kers of one Sin of our Brother, why not of all his Sins, by the &s;ame Rule? And if of his, why not of every other Man's that we join in Wor&s;hip with? It is ab&s;urd to imagine with &s;ome Ignorant, tho' well meaning People, that we partake of this Guilt at the <HI>Sacrament</HI> only, for we join in religious Wor&s;hip with them in other Parts of it, &s;uch as <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;es,</HI> as really as there; and therefore the afore&s;aid Glo&s;s will make us guilty of all the Sins of every one that we join with in Wor&s;hip, either in our Families or publick A&s;&s;emblies. And if the Ca&s;e be &s;o, Rea&s;on will teach us, to avoid with great Care, all private and publick <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> for the &s;ake of our <HI>Safety,</HI> to prevent our Ruin and Damnation; and yet the Almighty enjoins both, to promote our Benefit and Salvation.</P>
<P>Now how can the&s;e Things con&s;i&s;t together? Can it be rea|&s;onably &s;uppos'd, that an all-wi&s;e and gracious GOD would, in order to promote our good, enjoin us to u&s;e any Method which would bring upon us the <HI>Guilt</HI> of inumerable Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions? By the afore&s;aid Objection, con&s;idered in its ju&s;t and natural Con&s;e|quences, all private and publick Wor&s;hip are entirely overthrown; becau&s;e all Men that we do, or can a&s;&s;ociate with in this World, are imperfect Creatures, guilty of Multitudes of Sins, which ac|cording to it becomes ours, on our wor&s;hiping <HI>Jehovah</HI> with them, according to his Command; and therefore it does not only de&s;troy private and publick Wor&s;hip altogether, but ca&s;ts ba&s;e <HI>Bla&s;phemy</HI> upon the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, as if he was an Enemy to his Creatures as &s;uch, and enjoined a Religion upon them that tend|ed directly to promote their eternal Damnation, and that under the Pretext of Kindne&s;s and Love! But where is the Sen&s;e of our being <HI>Guilty</HI> of the Sins that we never con&s;ented to either vir|tually or actually?</P>
<P>BUT pray ob&s;erve, that God is not only bla&s;phemed by the afore&s;aid <HI>Objection,</HI> and all <HI>private</HI> and <HI>publick Wor&s;hip</HI> overthrown but likewi&s;e all Church <HI>Government</HI> is entirely unhing'd; for un|under the ubrage of it, every one that is Ignorant enough, and inclin'd to be a <HI>proud Separati&s;t,</HI> (the Character of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> of old) may according to their humour pretend <HI>Di&s;&s;atisfaction</HI> with &s;ome <HI>circum&s;tantials</HI> in <HI>Principle,</HI> or <HI>fault</HI> in <HI>Practice,</HI> either in the Mini&s;ter or &s;ome of the Communicants, where they were wont to join, and &s;o pack of abruptly as the fit takes them, agreeable to the wild flights of their ungovernable <HI>Fancy:</HI> According to this

<P>SURELY if People were more watchful over their own Hearts and Ways, they would have le&s;s of the <HI>leaven</HI> of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> that is, of their <HI>proud &s;eparating Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> from others, le&s;s of their <HI>Sowerne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Severity</HI> in cen&s;uring of others, for not <HI>Tything Mint</HI> and <HI>Annis</HI> and <HI>Cummin,</HI> for not being &s;o good as they are for&s;ooth, or even fit to conver&s;e with them.

<P>GIVE me leave to con&s;ider one <HI>Objection</HI> more, which is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That our Brethren of the pre&s;ent <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> have oppos'd the <HI>whole</HI> of the late <HI>Work of God</HI> in this Land, and a&s;cribed it to the <HI>Devil;</HI> in &s;upport of which, the&s;e Things follow|ing are alledg'd, viz.</P>

<P><PB N="121" REF="006423_0128_1028E3B7ED0A0F50">AGAIN, The <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> are produc'd as another Proof, in Con|firmation of the Charge; to which it may be reply'd, That not|with&s;tanding of &s;ome &s;lighty Repre&s;entations of the late religious Commotions, inter&s;pers'd in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e Writings; yet I know not that they a&s;&s;ign any of them, and much le&s;s all of them, to the <HI>Devil:</HI> Moreover it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that the&s;e Books were <HI>Anonymus,</HI> and never approv'd by the <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> by any authoritative judicial Act, nor, &s;o far as I know, by any of their inferior Judicatures, as &s;uch, and therefore cannot be ju&s;tly charged upon that <HI>Body</HI> as their Act and Deed.</P>
<P>BUT the following Paragraph of the <HI>Prote&s;t,</HI> page 11. is tho't by &s;ome to be a &s;ufficient Evidence of the Charge. The Words are the&s;e <Q>6. Their preaching the Terrors of the Law in &s;uch Manner and Dialect as has no precedent in the Word of God, but rather appears to be borrow'd from a wor&s;e Dialect, and &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly working on the Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections of weak Minds, &s;o as to cau&s;e them to cry out in a hideous Manner, and fall down in Convul&s;ion-like Fits, to the marring of the profiting both of them&s;elves and others, who are &s;o taken up in &s;eeing and hearing the&s;e odd Symptoms, that they cannot attend to, or hear what the Preacher &s;ays; and then after all, boa&s;ting of the&s;e Things as the <HI>Work of God,</HI> which we are per|&s;waded do proceed from an inferior or wor&s;e Cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>The in&s;ufficiency of this Evidence, may be plainly perceived by con&s;idering, that it is only &s;ome exceptionable particulars that are oppos'd in the preceeding Paragraph, <HI>viz.</HI> an un&s;criptural <HI>Mode</HI> of <HI>preaching</HI> the <HI>Terrors</HI> of the Law, an indu&s;trious <HI>work|ing</HI> on the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of <HI>weak Minds,</HI> cau&s;ing hideous <HI>out cries,</HI> and <HI>falling down</HI> in Convul&s;ion-like Fits, and <HI>boa&s;ting</HI> of the&s;e Things as the <HI>Work of God.</HI> Now are any of the&s;e Things a Part, or all of them together, the <HI>Work of God</HI> we have been contending for, or any Part of it, any nece&s;&s;ary Apendage of it, or any Evi|dence of it?

And does not <HI>Charity</HI> oblige us, to put the mo&s;t mild Con&s;truction upon others Words, that they can in Rea&s;on bear? The Sen&s;e I have given of the Words, is ea&s;y and natural, but the other is a Force upon them; pray does it not look more like the &s;trength of Prejudice then Argument, to turn Particulars into Generals or Univer&s;als, and put the har|de&s;t Interpretation upon Words, that they can po&s;&s;ibly bear. The Words of the Paragragph are particular and limited, <HI>boa&s;ting of</HI> THESE THINGS, <HI>as the work of GOD,</HI> if any were Guilty hereof, (as doubtle&s;s our Brethren were &s;o inform'd) they were to be pitied for their Weakne&s;s, and if any of the younger Mini&s;ters, im|prudently aggravated to an exce&s;&s;ive pitch, the Pa&s;&s;ions of the di&s;re&s;s'd, by an un&s;criptural or un&s;ea&s;onable Inculcation of Terrors, (at any Time) it was certainly very wrong; but whether there was

any Foundation for this Charge, in any Degree, it is not my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s at pre&s;ent to Inquire?</P>
<P>IN a Word, whatever unadvi&s;ed Expre&s;&s;ions, in private Con|ver&s;ation, might po&s;&s;ibly drop from the <HI>Lips</HI> of &s;ome of our <HI>Bre|thren</HI> in a heat of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> or <HI>ferment</HI> of <HI>Di&s;pute,</HI> (in di&s;parage|ment of the Work of GOD) many Years agone, which Methinks it is now high Time to forget, yet upon Enquiry I cannot find any UNITED TESTIMONY of their BODY upon <HI>Record</HI> again&s;t the late REVIVAL of RELIGION, (truly &s;o called) not one by which they deny the <HI>Reality</HI> of it, and far le&s;s a&s;cribe it to the <HI>Devil.</HI> Now whither it is Rea&s;onable or Charitable, for any to &s;uffer their Minds to be inflamed with prejudice again&s;t their Brethren, by unprov'd reports, judge ye? It never was, nor I believe ever can or will be prov'd, again&s;t the pre&s;ent Synod of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> That they have generally, univer&s;ally, or as a Body a&s;crib'd the late <HI>revival</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> (truly and properly &s;o call'd) to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and therefore however Pious our De&s;igns are, it is no Act of <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> to <HI>Truth,</HI> to <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> to <HI>Charity,</HI> or to the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Weal</HI> of CHRIST'S vi&s;ible <HI>Kingdom,</HI> to receive or &s;pread &s;uch Charges, as directly tend to create, encrea&s;e, and confirm <HI>Pre|judices,</HI> and enflame re&s;entments again&s;t our <HI>Brethren,</HI> widen the <HI>Breaches</HI> of <HI>Zyon</HI> as the Sea, and make her <HI>Wounds</HI> Bleed a fre&s;h, and reject a Remedy: May GOD in Mercy to his poor Church, Pardon and Reform &s;uch unaccountable Conduct!</P>
<P>PRAY may not an Acknowledgement be as rea&s;onably de&s;ir'd of us, for LICENCING and ORDAINING contrary to the Act of the Synod, as we can de&s;ire an Acknowledgement, upon the Account of the PROTEST? But can we make &s;uch an Acknowledgment? No! for whither we did right or wrong in Licencing &amp;c. we did it in the integrity of our Hearts, as believing it to be our Duty; &amp; if we wou'd exerci&s;e the &s;ame Charity towards our Brethren, as we de&s;ire to|wards our&s;elves, in this Ca&s;e, wou'd no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we believe that they pro|te&s;ted again&s;t us with the like Integrity, from an Apprehen&s;ion <Q>that the <HI>Church</HI> was in no &s;mall <HI>Danger</HI> of expiring out right, and that quickly as to the Form, Order and Con&s;titution of an Organiz'd Church</Q> (As they them&s;elves expre&s;s it in the 5th Page of the Prote&s;t) and if &s;o whither their view of Things was right or wrong, if they remain of the &s;ame Judgment how can they acknowledge without Sinning again&s;t Con&s;cience? And thus by in&s;i&s;ting on Acknowledgments, the way to Union is as effectually, as uncharitably, un&s;cripturally, and unrea&s;onably &s;hut up, without any probability of an Alteration; and is not this a la|mentable Ca&s;e? Surely it is!</P>
<P>NOW in order to avoid uncharitable <HI>Divi&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>Tumults;</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary to beware of <HI>Pride;</HI> for as <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>It is only by Pride that Contention comes,</HI> (Prov. xiii. 10.)

<P>HIS <HI>Parentage</HI> was, to appearance, ob&s;cure and mean. His <HI>Life</HI> was &s;pent not only in continual <HI>Labour</HI> and hard <HI>Travel,</HI> but in extreme <HI>Poverty;</HI> and hence it is &s;aid of him, <HI>that the Foxes have Holes, and the Birds of the Air have Ne&s;ts, but that the Son of Man hath no where to lay his Head.</HI> Sometimes he fed upon cour&s;e <HI>fare,</HI> and &s;ometimes was de&s;titute of ordinary <HI>Food,</HI> and &s;ometimes was indebted for it, even to <HI>Strangers</HI> of the humble&s;t Order and Character; yet we find no &s;haddow of <HI>mur|mur</HI> by our LORD'S Conduct in that <HI>humble &s;ituation,</HI> or any En|deavour after a change of it.</P>
<P>NOR was he only in a low and poor E&s;tate, but environ'd round with the mo&s;t formidable <HI>Dangers,</HI> and expos'd to all the <HI>Darts</HI> of <HI>Envy</HI> in their utmo&s;t virulence and malignity, <HI>the World hated him becau&s;e he was not of it, and &s;ought to &s;lay him;</HI> and this in return for the mo&s;t important unparallel'd and conde&s;cend|ing <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> that ever was or can be expre&s;&s;ed to the Sons of Men! Yet he was grievou&s;ly a&s;per&s;s'd and inhumanly per&s;ecuted, without committing the lea&s;t Offence; the&s;e Things our LORD bore with an undi&s;turb'd <HI>calm</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> and in&s;tead of <HI>Revenge,</HI> pour'd down <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> on his <HI>Enemies:</HI> He in&s;tructed their <HI>Minds,</HI> forgave their <HI>Offences,</HI> &s;ympathiz'd with them in their <HI>Straits,</HI> their <HI>Sorrows,</HI> healed their <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> and &s;upplicated his Father in their favour, <HI>Father forgive them!</HI></P>
<P>WHEN his <HI>Countrymen</HI> and <HI>Kindred</HI> &s;hew'd him ungrateful <HI>di&s;|re&s;pect,</HI> in&s;tead of complaining, he excus'd their <HI>Rudene&s;s,</HI> by ob|&s;erving, that <HI>a Prophet was not without Honour &s;ave in his own Country, and in his own Hou&s;e.</HI> And when the <HI>Samaritan Stran|gers</HI> treated him with indecency and contempt, and his forward <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> were fir'd with unhallow'd <HI>Indignation,</HI> for the Indignity and Affront that was &s;hewn to their Ma&s;ter, he gently labour'd to <HI>&s;often</HI> their <HI>Severity,</HI> and <HI>calm</HI> their <HI>Re&s;entment,</HI> by ob&s;erving, that they <HI>knew not what Spirit they were of,</HI> and that <HI>he came not into the World to de&s;troy Mens lives, but to &s;ave them.</HI></P>

<P>BUT to <HI>Forebearance, Meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Patience,</HI> let us add the glo|rious Grace and Vertue of <HI>Love:</HI> This is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to the Nature of true Chri&s;tianity; this is the grand <HI>Characteri&s;tick</HI> of its &s;incere Profe&s;&s;ors; this is their great <HI>Preparative</HI> for its promi&s;ed Re|wards.</P>
<P>LOVE, Dear Sirs, is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tianity;</HI> and hence it's called by our Lord him&s;elf, <HI>the fir&s;t and great Com|mand,</HI> (Mat. xxii. 37, 38, 39.) and truly &s;o it is, in re&s;pect of its <HI>Object,</HI> its <HI>Order,</HI> its <HI>Obligation,</HI> its <HI>Extent,</HI> its <HI>Excellency,</HI> its <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P>THE Supreme <HI>Object</HI> of <HI>Love,</HI> is the highe&s;t and be&s;t of Be|ings, the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, who is the Supreme <HI>Excellency</HI> and the <HI>chief Good. Augu&s;tine</HI> e&s;teemed it as an ine&s;timable <HI>Privilege,</HI> that he had Liberty to <HI>Love.</HI>

<P>THE <HI>order</HI> and <HI>dignity</HI> of <HI>Love,</HI> is &s;uch, that we mu&s;t place it before all other <HI>Graces</HI> and <HI>Duties,</HI> as the <HI>Foundation</HI> of <HI>Piety:</HI> What&s;oever is taught in the <HI>Law,</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> flows from this as a <HI>Fountain,</HI> and grows upon this as a <HI>Root,</HI> and hence we are commanded to be <HI>rooted and grounded in Love.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Obligation</HI> of <HI>Love,</HI> is indi&s;pen&s;able, and perpetual. As <HI>Jehovah</HI> fir&s;t be&s;tows his <HI>Love</HI> upon us, and then whatever he conferrs afterwards, he gives in <HI>Love,</HI> &s;o the ble&s;&s;ed GOD requires, that we fir&s;t give him our <HI>Love,</HI> and then do all from that Prin|ciple.

As to its DURATION it is Everla&s;ting. Mo&s;t of the other Commands &s;hall expire with this World, but this endures forever, when <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Mortification</HI> which do or ought to employ, a con&s;iderable Part of our Time expire, when <HI>Faith</HI> turns into <HI>vi&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> into <HI>fruition, Love</HI> will <HI>live,</HI> and <HI>burn</HI> in all its <HI>Beauty</HI> and Brightne&s;s, with an unmix'd, undemini&s;h'd, uninterrupted and eternal <HI>Flame.</HI> Here it is weakned and diverted by a variety of &s;en&s;ible <HI>Objects,</HI> and &s;trong <HI>Temptations,</HI> but there it will run in one continu'd <HI>Current</HI> towards its glorious Object and Center, without <HI>fear</HI> or <HI>jealou&s;y</HI> forever: <HI>Charity</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>never faileth; but whether there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Prophe&s;ies, they &s;hall fail; whether there be Knowledge it &s;hall vani&s;h away, for we know in part, and Prophe&s;y in part: But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part &s;hall be done away.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Excellency</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> is tran&s;cendent, in regard of its <HI>Matter.

The Al|mighty created us, pre&s;erves us, and confers many benefits upon us, but we can do nothing like the&s;e Things for GOD, he is in|finitely above our returns, but by Love, we render &s;omething like his Love to us. Love contains all the Divine <HI>Precepts</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> in its Bo&s;om; partly becau&s;e no Endeavour to obey any of them without it will be accepted, but every hone&s;t Endeavour will be accepted with it; and partly becau&s;e it realy inclines us to obey them all, and therefore virtually contains in it <HI>obedience</HI> to them all: And thus it may be truly call'd the <HI>Full|fillment</HI> of the <HI>Law:</HI> For it is realy &s;o in the &s;ight of GOD, in <HI>De&s;ign, Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> and <HI>Principle.</HI> Tho' <HI>David</HI> did not actually build the <HI>Temple,</HI> yet becau&s;e he &s;incerely intended it and was &s;trongly inclined to it, it is therefore &s;aid by GOD him&s;elf, to be done.
