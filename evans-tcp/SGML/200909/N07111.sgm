<P>THE Doddington, Captain Sam&s;on, failed from the Downs on the 23d of April, 1755, in company with the Pelham, the Houghton, the Streatham, and the Edgecourt, all in the &s;ervice of the Ea&s;t-India Company, and in about &s;even days got clear of the Channel; during this time Captain Sam&s;on perceived that his &s;hip &s;ailed fa&s;ter than any of the others, and he was unwilling to lo&s;e the ad|vantage of this &s;uperiority by keeping them company: He therefore &s;tood on alone, and, having very &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of them, he made Bonavi&s;ta, one of the Cape de Verd i&s;lands, lat. 16 north, on the 20th of May; and on the 21&s;t he got into Porto Pilor Bay. It now appeared either that he had been mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing his &s;hip to out&s;ail the re&s;t of the fleet, or that he had lo&s;t time by the cour&s;e he &s;teered, for he found the Pelham and the Streatham had reached the Bay two hours before him. The Houghton arrived &s;oon afterwards, but the Edgecourt did not come in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e 26th.</P>
<P>On the 27th of May, the Doddington, Pelham, Streatham, and Houghton, having taken in their water, proceeded on the voyage together, leaving the Edgecourt in the road; they continued in com|pany &s;teering S. by E. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> E. till the 28th, when Capt. Sam&s;on, thinking the cour&s;e too far ea&s;terly, ordered the Doddington to be kept &s;outh, which again &s;epa|rated her from the re&s;t of the fleet; and, after a fine voyage of &s;even weeks, &s;he made the land of the Cape of Good Hope. Having ju&s;t doubled the Cape, a

new departure was taken from de Agulhas on the 8th of July; and the ve&s;&s;el having &s;teered ea&s;tward about 24 hours, between the latitude of 35 deg. 30 min. and 36 deg. the Captain ordered her to be kept E. N. E.</P>
<P>In this cour&s;e &s;he continued till about a quarter before one in the morning of Thur&s;day, July 17, when &s;he &s;truck: The Officer from who&s;e journal this account is taken, was then a&s;leep in his cabbin; but, being &s;uddenly awaked by the &s;hock, &s;tarted up in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, and made all the ha&s;te he could to get upon the deck; here all the terrors of his &s;ituation ru&s;hed upon him at once; he &s;aw the men da&s;hed to and fro by the violence of the &s;ea that rolled over them, and the &s;hip breaking to pieces at every &s;troke of the &s;urge; he crawled over, with great difficulty, to the larboard &s;ide of the quarter-deck, which lay the highe&s;t out of water, and there he found the Captain, who &s;aid very little more than they mu&s;t all peri&s;h; in a few minutes a &s;ea parted them, and he &s;aw him no more. He made a &s;hift to get back to the quarter-deck, but he was very much brui&s;ed, and the &s;mall bone of his left arm was broken; all the re&s;t of the &s;hip was under water, and &s;hattered to pieces. In this dreadful &s;ituation, expecting every moment to be &s;wallowed up, he heard &s;omebody <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> out Land! Upon this he looked eagerly about him, but though he &s;aw &s;omething which he &s;uppo&s;ed was taken for land, he believed it to be only the rage of the &s;ea on the other &s;ide of the breakers; at the &s;ame moment the &s;ea broke over him with great violence, and not only forced him from his hold, but &s;tunned him by a violent blow upon his eye; though from this time he lay in&s;en&s;ible until after day-light, yet he continued upon the wreck, and when he recovered, he found him&s;elf made fa&s;t to a plank by a nail that had been forced into his &s;houlder; be&s;ides the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that

he felt from his wounds and brui&s;es, he was now &s;o benumbed with cold, that he could &s;carce move either hand or foot; he called out as loud as he could, and was heard by the people on the rocks; but they could give him no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o that it was a con&s;iderable time before he could di&s;engage him&s;elf and crawl on &s;hore.</P>
<P>This &s;hore was a barren uninhabited rock, in the lat. of 33 deg. 44 min. &s;outh, and di&s;tant about 250 leagues ea&s;t of the Cape of Good Hope. Here were now met Mr. Evan Jones, chief Mate; Mr. John Collet 2d, Mr. William Webb 3d, and Mr. S. Powel 5th Mate; Richard Topping, carpenter; Neal Both|well and Nathaniel Chi&s;holm, Quarter-ma&s;ters; Daniel Ladova, the Captain's &s;teward; Henry Sharp, the Surgeon's &s;ervant; Thomas Arnold, a Black, and John Mackdowal, &s;ervants to the Captain. Robert Bea&s;eley, John King, Gilbert Chain, Terence Mole, Jonas Ro&s;enbury, John Gla&s;s. &mdash; Taylor, and Henderick Scantz, &s;eamen; John Yets, Mid|&s;hipman, and John Li&s;ter, Ralph Smith, and Edward Dy&s;oy, matro&s;&s;es. The&s;e per&s;ons, being 23 in num|ber, were all that remained of 270 &s;ouls that were on board when the &s;hip &s;truck.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t care was to &s;earch among the things which had been thrown upon the rocks from the &s;hip, for &s;omething to cover them, in which they &s;ucceeded beyond their hopes. The next thing they felt the want of was fire, and this was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;upplied; &s;ome of them attempted to kindle two pieces of wood, by rubbing them together, but without &s;ucce&s;s; others went peeping about among the rocks to pick up &s;ome|thing that might &s;erve for a flint and &s;teel; after long &s;earch they found a box that contained two gun flints and a broken file; this was a joyful acqui&s;ition, but &s;till they had nothing that would kindle from a &s;park, and, till &s;omething like tinder could be procured, the
<PB N="6" REF="009058_0005_10306ADFE2335F00">
flint and &s;teel were u&s;ele&s;s; a farther &s;earch was there|fore undertaken with inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;olicitude and anxiety; a ca&s;k of gunpowder was at la&s;t di&s;covered, but to their great di&s;appointment it proved to be wet; however, upon a near examination, a &s;mall quantity was found at the bottom of the ca&s;k, which had &s;uf|fered no damage; &s;ome of this they brui&s;ed on a linen rag, which &s;erved them very well for tinder, and a fire was &s;oon made; the brui&s;ed and wounded gathered about it, and the re&s;t went in &s;earch of other nece&s;&s;aries, without which the rock could afford them but a &s;hort re&s;pite from de&s;truction. In the afternoon a box of wax candles and a ca&s;e of brandy were brought in; both were extremely welcome, e&s;pecially the brandy, of which every one thought it advi&s;eable to take a dram; &s;oon after &s;ome others of the party returned with an account that they had di&s;covered a ca&s;k almo&s;t full of fre&s;h water, which was yet of more con&s;equence than the brandy; and Mr. Jones brought in &s;ome pieces of &s;alt pork, and &s;oon after &s;ome others arrived, driving before them &s;even hogs, which had come on &s;hore alive; &s;ome ca&s;ks of beer, water, and flour, were al&s;o &s;een at a di&s;tance, but it was not then po&s;&s;ible to get them over the rocks; the approach of night made it nece&s;&s;ary to provide &s;ome &s;helter; all hands therefore were employed to make a tent of &s;ome canvas that had been thrown on &s;hore, which was at la&s;t effected, though it was &s;o &s;mall for want of more &s;ail-cloth, that it would not hold them all. The i&s;land was much frequented by a kind of water-fowl, &s;omething larger than a duck, called a gannet; and the highe&s;t part of it was covered with their dung; upon this part they were obliged to build their tent, for fear of being overflowed; and they placed tho&s;e who could not walk, under the tent, and kindled a fire near them; but, as they had pa&s;&s;ed the day without food,
<PB N="7" REF="009058_0006_10306AE295770A78">
they pa&s;&s;ed the night without re&s;t; for, be&s;ides that they were &s;unk a foot in the fowl's dung, the night was &s;o tempe&s;tuous that the wind blew away their fire, and, before it could be &s;craped together again, the rain put it out.</P>
<P>In the morning, which was Friday, July the 18th, tho&s;e that were able went again about the rock, to &s;ee what could be &s;aved from the wreck; but, to their great mortification, they found all the ca&s;ks which they had &s;een the night before, except one of beer, and one of flour, &s;taved to pieces again&s;t the rocks; &s;oon after the&s;e were &s;ecured, the tide flowed up, and put a &s;top to the work of that day. The company therefore was called together to eat their fir&s;t meal, and &s;ome ra&s;hers of pork were broiled upon the coals for dinner.</P>
<P>The &s;itting down thus de&s;olate and forlorn to a re|pa&s;t, which they u&s;ed to &s;hare in the convivial cheer|fulne&s;s, which naturally aro&s;e from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of pre&s;ent plenty, and the hope of future, &s;truck them with &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their condition, that they bur&s;t into pa&s;&s;ionate lamentations, wringing their hands, and looking round them with all the wildne&s;s of de|&s;pair; in &s;uch tumult of mind, our thoughts hurry from one object to another, to fix, if po&s;&s;ible, upon &s;omething that may afford comfort; and one of the company recollecting, that, as the carpenter was among them, they might build a &s;loop, if they could procure materials and tools, mentioned this as a &s;ub|ject of hope to the re&s;t; every man's attention was immediately turned upon the carpenter, who declared that he had no doubt but he &s;hould be able to build a &s;loop that would carry them all to &s;ome port with &s;afety, if tools and materials could be found; at that time indeed, they had no rational pro&s;pect of pro|curing either, any more than of being able to victual
<PB N="8" REF="009058_0007_10306AE55DFFA060">
a &s;loop, if they had one ready built; yet they had no &s;ooner placed their deliverance one remove beyond total impo&s;&s;ibility, than they &s;eemed to think it neither improbable nor difficult; they began to eat without farther repining, and from that moment the boat en|gro&s;&s;ed their whole conver&s;ation, and they not only debated upon the &s;ize and manner of rigging her, but to what port they &s;hould &s;teer her, whether the Cape or Degagoa.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had fini&s;hed their repa&s;t, &s;ome went in &s;earch of tools, and others to mend the tent; no tools however were found that day.</P>
<P>Saturday, July 19. They &s;ecured four butts of water, one ca&s;k of flour, one hog&s;head of brandy, and one of their little boats, which had been thrown up by the tide, in a &s;hattered condition; but they found no tools, except a &s;craper.</P>
<P>Sunday, July 20. They had the good fortune to find a hamper, in which there were files, &s;ail-needles, gimblets, and an azimuth compa&s;s card. They al&s;o found two quadrants, a carpenter's adze, a chi&s;&s;el, and three &s;word-blades, and a che&s;t of trea&s;ure. This &s;earch was made very early in the morning, as there had been a prodigious &s;urf rolling in all the day be|fore, by which it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome|thing would be thrown up. At ten o'clock they all a&s;&s;embled to prayers, and did not go out again til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> after dinner, when they found mo&s;t of the packets o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> letters belonging to the King and the Company <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e they carefully dried and laid by.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, as they were &s;earching a beach, they found the body of a Gentle woman, which they knew to be that of Mrs. Collet, the wife of their &s;econd Mate, who was then at a little di&s;tance from the &s;pot The mutual affection of this couple was remarkabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tender, and Mr. Jones, the fir&s;t Mate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el

&s;tepped a&s;ide to Mr. Collet, and &s;ound means to take him to the other &s;ide of the rock, while the other two Mates, the carpenter, and &s;ome others, dug a grave in the bird's dung, in which they depo&s;ited the body, reading over it the burial &s;ervice, from a French prayer book, which had driven a&s;hore with her from the wreck. Having thus paid the debt of humanity to the dead, and concealed from Mr. Collet a &s;ight which would mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly, if not fatally, have affected him, they found means, after &s;ome days, to diclo&s;e to him by degrees what they had done, and to give him the wedding-ring, which they had taken from her finger. He received it with great emotion, and after|wards &s;pent many days in rai&s;ing a monument over the grave, by piling up the &s;quare&s;t &s;tones he could find, on the top of which he fixed an elm plank, and in&s;cribed it with her name, her age, the time of her death, and &s;ome account of the fatal accident by which it was occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>On Monday, July 21. They &s;ecured &s;ome more water and pork, and &s;ound &s;ome timber plank, cor|dage, and canvas. The&s;e they &s;ecured with great joy for the boat, though as yet they were in want of many implements, without which it was impo&s;&s;ible for the carpenter to work. He had ju&s;t fini&s;hed a &s;aw, but he had neither hammer nor nails. It hap|pened, however, that one of the &s;eamen, Hendrick Scantz, a Swede, having picked up an old pair of bellows, brought them to his companions, and told them, that he had been by profe&s;&s;ion a &s;mith, and that with the&s;e bellows and a forge, which he hoped they would be able, by his directing, to build, he could furni&s;h the carpenter with all the tools he would want, nails included, as plenty of iron might be ob|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> by burning the timber which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> come on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from the wreck.

with a tran&s;port of joy; the &s;mith immediately ap|plied him&s;elf to mend the bellows, and the three fol|lowing days were &s;pent in building a tent and a forge, in bringing together the timber and plank for the car|penter's u&s;e, who was al&s;o bu&s;y in getting ready the few tools he had, that he might begin the boat as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, July 24. The carpenter, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Chi&s;holm, the Quarter-ma&s;ter, began to work upon the keel of the boat, which they had determined &s;hould be a &s;loop, 30 feet long and 12 wide. This day al&s;o the &s;mith fini&s;hed his &s;orge, and laid in a quantity of fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for fewel. From this time, the car|penter and &s;mith continued to work with indefatigable diligence, except when they were prevented by the weather; the &s;mith, having fortunately found the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing and nut of a bower anchor, which &s;erved him for an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;upplied chi&s;tels, axes, hammers, and nails, as they wanted; and the carpenter u&s;ed them with great dexterity and di&s;patch till the 31&s;t, when he fell &s;ick.</P>
<P>As the lives of the whole company depended upon the carpenter, they watched his recovery with the utmo&s;t impatience and anxity; and, to their un&s;peak|able joy, he was &s;o far recovered on the 2d of Augu&s;t, as to return to his work.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the &s;tores which they had &s;aved from the wreck were &s;o near exhau&s;ted, that they came to an allowance of two ounces of bread a man per day, and had no &s;alt pork, except what they were determined to keep to victual their boat; water al&s;o fell &s;hort. In this di&s;tre&s;s they had recour&s;e to &s;everal expedients: They dug a well, in hopes to find a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ring, but were di&s;appointed; they attempted to kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome of the ganne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that &s;ettled on the top of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and in this they had &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s; but they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

fle&s;h very rank, of a fi&s;hy ta&s;te, and as black as a &s;hoe.

They killed al&s;o &s;ome &s;eals, but all tho&s;e who eat of them were &s;ick.</P>
<P>When they were driven to great di&s;tre&s;s, they killed a hog; but they had generally &s;ucce&s;s in fi&s;hing on a float, and they &s;ometimes &s;ent out two at a time. It happened, however, that Mr. Collet, the &s;econd Mate, and Mr. Yets, the Mid&s;hipman, were very near being driven out to &s;ea on one of the&s;e floats, where they would inevitably have peri&s;hed. &mdash; On the 20th of Augu&s;t they had fi&s;hing all the afternoon, till about four o'clock, when they weighed, and en|deavoured to come in again; but, the wind &s;uddenly fre&s;hening up to the we&s;tward, they found that in|&s;tead of gaining a head, they drove out very fa&s;t. The people on &s;hore perceived their di&s;tre&s;s, but knew not how to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; at la&s;t, however, they &s;ent out another float, with killies and ropes, which they hoped would enable them to ride, till the wind be|came more moderate; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t the &s;urf was &s;o great, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it over&s;et her three times, and the men were obliged to &s;wim back.

This gave them fre&s;h hope, and every one was ready to venture out for the deliverance of their friends. The carpenter di&s;patched the boat in about a quarter of an hour, and &s;he &s;oon overtook the float, and took Collet and Yets on board. They &s;oon &s;ound, however, that the water gained very fa&s;t upon them, notwith|&s;tanding

<P>As they were now afraid of venturing any more on the ra&s;t, the carpenter went again to work on the little boat, and put her into complete repair. Their &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce&s;s in fi&s;hing was very uncertain; &s;ometimes they took great quantities, and &s;ometimes they took none. Nor were the &s;upplies they obtained on &s;hore le&s;s pre|carious; the gannets would &s;ometimes &s;ettle in amaz|ing numbers, like a cloud; and &s;ometimes they would totally di&s;appear for &s;everal days together. This made them very de&s;irous of finding &s;ome way to pre&s;erve the food they caught from putrifaction, that they might lay by the &s;urplus of a fortunate day, to &s;erve them, when neither gannets nor fi&s;h were to be caught. They made &s;everal atempts to cure both their fi&s;h and their fowl by &s;moaking it, but without &s;ucce&s;s. They then attempted to make &s;alt, but this had like to have been fatal to them all. The &s;mith had mended a copper ve&s;&s;el for the experiment; and they imme|diately began to work, without knowing that their proce&s;s in &s;alt-making would di&s;&s;olve the &s;urface of the copper into verdigrea&s;e, and that this &s;olution or ru&s;t of copper was poi&s;on. Salt, however, was pro|duced; but the quality that made it poi&s;onous hap|pened to abound in &s;uch a degree, as to make it in|tolerably offen&s;ive to the ta&s;te: It was therefore thrown away; but tho&s;e who had ventured to palate it were &s;eized with violent cholics, cold &s;weats, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">chings, which &s;ufficiently convinced them of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> had e&s;caped.</P>

<P>While they were waiting the return of the boat, they were all thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation by an accident which happened to the carpenter, who unfortunately cut his leg with an adze, in &s;uch a manner, that he was in great danger of bleeding to death, they having no &s;urgeon among them, nor any thing proper to apply to the wound.

The men, therefore, who thought fit &s;ecretly to take what they deemed their &s;hare of this trea&s;ure, were not, in their own opinions, guilty of di&s;hone&s;ty, but intended only to &s;ecure what they feared the Of|ficers would monopoli&s;e, and by this means prevent di&s;putes which, in their circum&s;tances, might pro|duce fatal effects.

<P>On Friday October 11, they perceived the ganners, which had of late for&s;aken them, to hover again about the rock in great numbers, and were in hopes they would &s;ettle to lay their eggs, in which, to their great joy, they were not di&s;appointed; for after this time they were con&s;tantly &s;upplied with eggs in great plenty, till the beginning of January, when the &s;ea&s;on of laying was pa&s;t.</P>

It was noon the next day before the wind abated, and then the boat ventured off; but, as the waves &s;till ran high, it could bring in no more than two at a time, leaving the float behind them.

<P>Sunday 14. Two of the men, having had nothing to eat the&s;e two days, begged they might be put on &s;hore&punc; and live among the natives. Accordingly they were landed &s;afe; but the wind being likely to &s;hift to the we&s;tward, &s;ignals were repeated all night, by

&s;hewing lights, in hopes to bring them to the water|&s;ide, before the &s;urf ro&s;e too high. However, they did not appear till &s;ix o'clock in the morning, when it was too late, there being a fre&s;h gale of wind, and a large &s;urf. The ve&s;&s;el therefore &s;ailed along &s;hore, in hopes to find a more favourable place, and at two leagues di&s;tance anchored in five fathom. Four men were &s;ent in the boat, two to go to meet the four men that landed ye&s;terday, and to found the river's mouth. In about three hours the two men returned with the other four, but were afraid to attempt to come off, there being too great a &s;urf to launce the boat.</P>
<P>Monday 15. At day light weighed, and &s;tood clo&s;e to the &s;hore; and &s;eeing them &s;till loth to venture, called to them, that, if they did not come off im|mediately, they mu&s;t be obliged to leave them, being without provi&s;ions, or any likelihood of getting any there. This threatening had its de&s;ired effect, for two of them ventured off in the boat, though there was a large &s;urf. When they come on board, they informed them that the natives received the men very civilly, and gave them beef and fi&s;h to eat, and milk to drink, and conducted them over the mountains, from where they landed, till they met our people. The wind being ea&s;terly, a fair wind into the river, they all agreed to wait till high water, and run the ri&s;que of the bar. At two in the afternoon they weighed, and made &s;ail for the river, and got in very well, without &s;hipping any water, and anchored in two and an half fathom water.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t care was to con&s;ult in what manner to trade with the natives for provi&s;ions and other nece&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> having never heard of any trading on that part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> coa&s;t.

bolts, nails, and &s;ome copper hoops, made into brace|lets for their arms and legs, which the people in India wear, and call them bangles. The&s;e they took on &s;hore, and &s;hewing them to the natives; at the &s;ame time making &s;igns for what they wanted in ex|change, by kneeling down and gnawing the gra&s;s, holding their hands up like horns, and making a noi&s;e like that of bullocks, &s;heep, &amp;c. which they &s;oon under&s;tood, and were very expeditious in driving down two &s;mall bullocks, which they purcha&s;ed for about one pound of copper and three or four bra&s;s buttons, each bullock weighing about five or &s;ix hundred, very good meat. The &s;avages &s;eemed very well &s;atisfied with their bargain, and promi&s;ed to bring more bul|locks. They likewi&s;e brought milk in great quantites, which was purcha&s;ed at a very cheap rate, giving only a bra&s;s button for about two or three gallons. Like|wi&s;e a &s;mall grain, like Guinea wheat, which they purcha&s;ed at the &s;ame rate, and ground it between two &s;tones, and baked it upon &s;ome embers for bread, hoping it would keep; but it grew mouldy in three days. They therefore u&s;ed to boil it with their meat, and found it very good food. Here they &s;taid about a fortnight, during which time they vi&s;ited their towns about ten or twelve miles, where they lived in huts covered with ru&s;hes like a kind of thatch, and very neat within, and were extremely obliging. At the&s;e times they u&s;ed to eat with the &s;avages, who liked their way of dre&s;&s;ing victuals, though they are parti|cularly fond of the entrails, &s;uch as the paunch and guts, which they mo&s;tly eat raw, only &s;haking out the excrement. In &s;hort they behaved very &s;ociably, and were no ways &s;hy of their women. Their chief exerci&s;e is hunting, and their only arms lance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> two &s;hort &s;ticks with a knob at the end; after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> their prey with the lance, they knock it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the &s;tick.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="009058_0024_10302D80B2EA4570">They wear little or no clothing in the day-time, and in the night only a bullock's hide, which they dry thoroughly, and make them very &s;upple. There chief ornaments are a piece of a bullock's tail, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ngs dangling down from their rump to their heels, with a few &s;mall &s;ea-&s;hells tied to it; and likewi&s;e &s;everal &s;mall pieces of the &s;kin tied round the knees, ancles, and arms. Their hair they plai&s;ter up with a great quantity of tallow or fat mixed with a kind of red earth, and likewi&s;e rub their bodies all over with grea&s;e. They are prodigious active and dexterous with their lances, which they will throw thirty or forty yards, and hit a &s;mall head of corn. Among the&s;e natives, who are entirely black, and all woolly-haired, they &s;aw a youth, &s;eemingly about twelve or fourteen years of age, quite white; and his features had the re&s;em|blance of an European, having fine light hair, not in the lea&s;t re&s;embling that of the other natives.</P>
<P>Monday 29. Having, by the ble&s;&s;ing of Providence, laid in a comfortable &s;tock of provi&s;ions, at five in the morning they weighed, and &s;oon got over the bar, And made &s;ail for the river St. Lucia.</P>
<P>Nothing material happened till Tue&s;day April the 6th, when, after &s;ome difficulty, they got into a river, and moored in three fathom water.</P>
<P>Here they went on &s;hore, and &s;oon found the in|habitants to be quite another &s;ort of people from the la&s;t; for, when they &s;hewed them what they had to trade with, they &s;ignified that they wanted &s;ome &s;mall kind of grain. However, upon &s;hewing them bra&s;s buttons, they imediately brought down &s;ome bul|locks, fowls, potatoes, pumkins, &amp;c. The bullocks they could not agree about, the &s;avages wanting bra&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings large enough to go round the collar.

The &s;avages &s;eem|ing to have a great veneration for bra&s;s, they carried a bra&s;s handle of an old che&s;t and &s;hewed it them; for which they immediately offered two bullocks, which was readily agreed to; and they drove them down to our boat. The&s;e were a haughty proud peo|ple, and not &s;o hone&s;t as the former, having detected their principal Governor, whom they paid for a lodg|ing in one of their huts for the night, in &s;tealing &s;ome pieces of iron. They &s;taid here two or three days in the country, in which time they never could get them to eat with them. They likewi&s;e differed greatly from the other people in their cookery, dre&s;&s;ing all their victuals in a very cleanly manner, and are like|wi&s;e very cleanly in their bodies; the fir&s;t thing they do in the morning is to wa&s;h them&s;elves all over; then they go to &s;ome kind of devotion, which they never ob&s;erved in the others. Neither have the&s;e any of the ornaments the others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e: They pride them|&s;elves much in their hair, which they dre&s;s up very neatly; and are extremely &s;hy in regard to their wo|men. Their arms are the &s;ame as the others, and al&s;o their diver&s;ions. They found a few men here who came from Delagoa, and had &s;ome ambergrea&s;e and elephant's teeth to di&s;po&s;e of; the latter in great plenty.</P>
<P>Sunday 18. A plea&s;ant gale we&s;terly, and fair weather: At &s;even in the morning being all on board, they weighed and made &s;ail; about a quarter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> high water, when they got almo&s;t to the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, they very imprudently hawled the fails down, and let go the grapnail clo&s;e to the brake of a &s;and, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of them got the boat out and went on &s;hore, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ing that they would &s;ooner take their chance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

among the natives, than be drowned in attempting to go over the bar; the re&s;t were therefore either to venture over the bar or to go on &s;hore, the ve&s;&s;el not being able to get back, the wind and the tide &s;elling both out of the river, &s;o that before half ebb &s;he would beat to pieces. Therefore, in hopes to &s;ave them|&s;elves and the boat, they weighed and got to the breakers; there they lay beating in a di&s;mal condition, having no more than eight feet water, and the ve&s;&s;el drawing five. After half an hour the &s;urface was &s;mooth, and by the Almighty's providence they got &s;afe out of the river St. Lucia. The poor creatures who had left the ve&s;&s;el, &s;ome with only a &s;hirt and a pair of drawers, travelled along &s;hore.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el &s;tood to the northward till Tue&s;day at four in the afternoon, when they anchored in Delagoa river in nine fathom, where they found the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e gally &s;now, Capt.

In order to which, they enticed four or five of their men on &s;hore, and &s;ecured two more on board the &s;now. This done, Mr. Jones went with Captain Chandler's pinnace manned and armed, and took all the money, plate, and packets he could f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd brought them on board the &s;now, in order to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er them on their arrival at Madra&s;s.
