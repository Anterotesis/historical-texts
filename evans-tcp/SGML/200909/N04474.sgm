</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Prophecy of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t &s;ublime and noble Pieces of the Old Te&s;tament, whether we con&s;ider the Force of Thought, the Magnificence of the De&s;criptions, or the Maje&s;ty and Importance of the Subjects with which they abound. Among the latter of the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the Subjects, there are none that &s;how with a diviner Brightne&s;s, or ca&s;t a more radiant Lu&s;tre thro' the Book, than tho&s;e which concern the Advent of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and the illu&s;trious Tran&s;actions that &s;hould attend it.
<PB N="6" REF="005550_0004_10185BAA96422A78">
This is a Theme that the Prophet delights to dwell upon, and introduces throughout the whole of his lofty Predic|tions.</P>
<P>The Chapter before us is of this Kind, in which the in&s;pired Man gives us the Character of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and de&s;cribes his powerful and happy Kingdom. This is done with an Eloquence and Beauty peculiar to him&s;elf. At the 10th Ver&s;e, our Saviour is de&s;cribed as lifted up as an En&s;ign, and the Gentiles &s;eeking to him, while he thus purcha&s;es a Re&s;t for them. <HI>And in that Day there &s;hall be a Root of</HI> Je&s;&s;e, <HI>which &s;hall &s;tand for an En&s;ign of the People; to it &s;hall the Gentiles &s;eek, and his Re&s;t &s;hall be glorious.</HI> That is, the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> who is the Root of <HI>Je&s;&s;e,</HI> &s;hall by his being lifted up on his Cro&s;s, obtain a ble&s;&s;ed Re&s;t for his cho&s;en People; among whom &s;hall be the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who &s;hall &s;eek to him for it. The Di&s;pen&s;ation he brings is a Re&s;t compared with the Yoke of <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Ceremonies. It brings with it a Re&s;t of Mind, an <HI>Heart fixed tru&s;ting in the Lord.</HI> There is al&s;o a glorious Re&s;t for the Church upon Earth in the latter Day: <HI>The new Earth, wherein &s;hall dwell Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And there is beyond and above all, the Re&s;t that remains for the Peo|ple of God, in the heavenly World.</P>
<P>The Text that is under our Con&s;ideration, includes in it, all the Re&s;ts that the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us be&s;tows on true Be|lievers, whether in this World, or the World to come; for Time, or for Eternity; to the Soul, or to the Body. However, we will, if you plea&s;e, confine it to the Re&s;t after this Life, in the heavenly World. That <HI>Re&s;t will be glorious</HI> without di&s;pute; and the Words contain a very ju&s;t De&s;cription of it. It is call'd a <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> which is a ne|gative De&s;cription; and excludes all manner of Unea&s;ine&s;s or Di&s;turbance. It is called a <HI>glorious Re&s;t;</HI> which is a po&s;itive De&s;cription, and implies all po&s;&s;ible and real Ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s.

And it is called <HI>His Re&s;t,</HI> that is, Chri&s;t's Re&s;t, ina&s;much as he is the Owner of it: For <HI>the Son of Man is Lord al&s;o of the Sabbath.</HI> The Doctrine that the Words pre&s;ent us with, is this,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> The Re&s;t of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which he has laid up in the heavenly World for his People, will be a glorious Re&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>There are three Propo&s;itions contained in the Doctrine.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>There is a Re&s;t laid up for the People of God, in the heavenly World.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>This Re&s;t will be a glorious Re&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>That it is the Re&s;t of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he is the Owner of it.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. <HI>There is a Re&s;t laid up for the People of God, in the heavenly World.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;peaking to this Head, I &s;hall &s;how, what the Re&s;t is not, what it is, and endeavour at a Scripture Proof of it, as I go along.</P>
<P>It may here be premi&s;ed then, That by this Re&s;t, <HI>We are not to under&s;tand an idle Ce&s;&s;ation from all Employment.</HI> The holy Souls in the heavenly World, do not &s;pend their E|ternity in a drow&s;y Indolence. They are not wa&s;ting tho&s;e golden Ages in a &s;upine Negligence and Idlene&s;s. No, in this Sen&s;e, they are never unactive, but we read of them, Rev. iv. 8. <HI>They re&s;t not Day nor Night, &s;aying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.</HI> That is, they are never idle, but always diligent in glorifying and admiring the Perfections of God. Not one Hour of their happy Duration rolls unu&s;eful
<PB N="8" REF="005550_0006_10185BAF4DB1C490">
away; not one Moment is lo&s;t to them in that endle&s;s Succe&s;&s;ion of Ages.</P>
<P>But as a po&s;itive An&s;wer, we &s;hall &s;ay, that the Inhabi|tants of the Paradi&s;e above, re&s;t from all <HI>painful Labours.</HI> Tho' they do not cea&s;e from acting, yet their Indu&s;try is not labourious and difficult to them. It is true, they are con&s;tantly taken up with the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Heaven, but it is no longer arduous and unea&s;y. They perform the mo&s;t exalted Services, with the clo&s;e&s;t Application, and without Intermi&s;&s;ion; and at the &s;ame Time enjoy the &s;erene&s;t Tranquility, and Compo&s;ure of Mind. The Works of former Years, when they lived upon our Earth, are now no longer able to perplex and mole&s;t them. No longer will they <HI>&s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate,</HI> when they are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Happine&s;s of the Kingdom. No more will they <HI>give Diligence to make their Calling and Election &s;ure;</HI> when their Faith is turned into Vi&s;ion, and their Hope concluded in Enjoyment. Never will they again weary and tire them&s;elves in the Exerci&s;es of Religion, or the Duties of their &s;ecular Employments; but will inhabit a Quietne&s;s and Peace, without the lea&s;t Mole&s;tation or Di&s;turbance. Heb. iv. 10. <HI>He that is entred into his Re&s;t, hath cea&s;ed from his own Works, as God did from his.</HI> Nay, they are gone to the Reward of their pa&s;t Actions, and have their Labours crowned with an ample Retribution and Recompence. Rev. xiv. 13. <HI>I heard a Voice from Heaven, &s;aying unto me, Write, Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, &s;aith the Spirit, that they may re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the ble&s;&s;ed Spirits of the Ju&s;t in Heaven, re&s;t from all <HI>Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Affliction.</HI> In this World, all Men meet with Griefs and Woes, and every Child of <HI>Adam</HI> is <HI>born to Trouble as the Sparks fly upward.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005550_0007_10185BB0D42EB3C8">And as all Men in general are &s;ubject to the unhappy Incidents of humane Life; &s;o the pious Man in particu|lar is peculiarly obnoxious to many &s;upernumerary Tryals, which a <HI>Stranger</HI> to true Piety <HI>intermeddles not with.</HI> Per|&s;ecutions and Abu&s;es from a degenerate World, are no &s;mall Part of the Pains that encompa&s;s him. He has an Awe of that Eternity upon his Mind, which the &s;ecure Sinner never &s;uffers to give him an unea&s;y Reflection. He is grieved at the Withdraw of God from him, and when his Saviour <HI>hides his Face he is troubled;</HI> while the unregenerate Wretch goes quietly on, and glides &s;moothly to the End of his Journey, unruffled with &s;uch Cares, and entirely ignorant of every Fear and Concern of &s;uch a Nature. In a Word, the good Man <HI>thro' much Tribula|tion enters into the Kingdom of God,</HI> be&s;ides the Sorrows common to all Men in <HI>this pre&s;ent evil World.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Condition of the Children of God here, but in the heavenly World, they are removed at an infinite Di&s;tance from every unea&s;y Thought; and they leave all the Angui&s;h of their temporal Life behind them, when they enter that Place of Re&s;t. And not only do good Men when they die, go to a World where there is <HI>no more</HI> Affliction, but they receive a Reward for the former Anxieties that they have met with, and have born with a decent Re&s;ignation and Patience. That Beatitude is fully accompli&s;hed unto them, P&s;al. xciv. 12, 13. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man whom thou cha&s;tene&s;t, O Lord, and teache&s;t him out of thy Law: That thou maye&s;t give him Re&s;t from the Days of Adver&s;ity.</HI> And agreeable to this is that magnificent De&s;cription of the Paradi&s;e of God, in <HI>Rev.</HI> vii. from the 9th Ver&s;e, where the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> gives us an Account of a glorious Vi&s;ion he had of it. And he tells us expre&s;ly, that the happy Inhabitants of it came out of great Tribulation, Ver&s;e 14. And he concludes the
<PB N="10" REF="005550_0008_10185BB26A732060">
&s;ublime Narration, Rev. vii. 16, 17. <HI>They &s;hall Hunger no more, neither Thir&s;t any more, neither &s;hall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat.&mdash;And God &s;hall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</HI> And in the &s;ame beautiful Manner, is the new <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> repre&s;ented, Rev. xxi. 4. <HI>And God &s;hall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; and there &s;hall be no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying, neither &s;hall there be any more Pain; for the former Things are pa&s;&s;ed away.</HI> Thus do the ble&s;&s;ed Spirits in Heaven, re&s;t from all Sorrow, and every afflictive Evil.</P>
<P>Again, The <HI>Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect,</HI> re&s;t from <HI>Sin,</HI> and are entirely freed from the Guilt and Power of that Wor&s;t of all Evils.</P>
<P>In this World, the be&s;t of Men are full of Imperfection and Sin; and have Cau&s;e to go Mourning all the Day, becau&s;e of the Oppre&s;&s;ion of that great Enemy. The holy <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf, under a &s;ad Conviction of it, cries out, Rom. vii. 24. <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the Body of this Death.</HI> Thus that ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle complains of the Tyranny of original Sin. And even in the mo&s;t &s;incere and devout Frames of his Mind, when he was engaging in the &s;olemne&s;t Exerci&s;es of Religion, he laments it, that he was &s;till infe&s;ted by his innate Corrup|tions, ver&s;e 11. <HI>When I would do Good, Evil is pre&s;ent with me.</HI> And thus it is with every good Man, while he lives in this World of Sin and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But in the heavenly World, there is no more Sin. Rev. xxi. 17. <HI>There &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into it any Thing that defileth, or worketh Abomination.</HI> There is no Guilt in tho&s;e pure and deathle&s;s Regions, to bla&s;t the Beauty of the Place, or ca&s;t a Gloom over the immortal Day that crowns it. Not one <HI>Action</HI> performed in that Mountain of Holine&s;s, has the lea&s;t Mixture of Sin to &s;tain or &s;ully it: Not one <HI>idle Word</HI> intrudes it &s;elf into
<PB N="11" REF="005550_0009_10185BB91F5CA020">
the ravi&s;hing <HI>Hallelujahs</HI> that ince&s;&s;antly echo there: Nay, not &s;o much as one <HI>vain Thought</HI> pollutes or di&s;compo&s;es the Minds of the Saints in tho&s;e &s;potle&s;s Realms of Feli|city.</P>
<P>We might add here, That the Spirits in Paradi&s;e, are not only entirely free from Sin, but they are al&s;o at Re&s;t from every <HI>Temptation</HI> to Sin. They have no Lu&s;ts with|in to &s;ollicit them; no en&s;naring Trifles from without to allure and &s;educe them. The Devil, their grand Adver|&s;ary, cannot come at them, to u&s;e his Fraud and Subtilty, when once they are removed to that &s;inle&s;s Kingdom: Nor can his fiery Darts reach to tho&s;e glorious Heights that they are advanced to, in tho&s;e lofty Abodes. Tho' the pious Soul, while it is linked to the Body, is hurried and buffeted with a numberle&s;s Variety of Sugge&s;tions from <HI>Satan;</HI> yet, no &s;ooner has it enter'd into tho&s;e e|verla&s;ting Doors, but it has an eternal Deliverance from them; it &s;hall never be di&s;tracted with one of them more. The dying Believer may &s;ay to Sin, and Satan, and all his Temptations, as our Saviour &s;aid to the <HI>Jews,</HI> John vii. 33, 34. <HI>Yet a little while and I am with you, and then I go to him that &s;ent me,&mdash;and whither I go, ye cannot come.</HI> In this Manner may the pious Man &s;ing in the la&s;t Mo|ments of his Life: His failing Pul&s;e, and decrea&s;ing Breath, may in&s;pire a new Delight into his Soul; and he may kindle with a heavenly Tran&s;port, at the Approaches of his own Mortality.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;een what that Re&s;t is, that the Children of God have prepared for them, beyond the Confines of the Grave. We have &s;hewn that they have a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from all painful Labour, from all afflictive Evil, from all Sin, and from every Temptation. We come now to the &s;econd Thing in the Doctrine.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="12" REF="005550_0010_10185BBC24E70198">II. <HI>The Re&s;t that is laid up for gracious Souls in another World, will be a glorious Re&s;t.</HI> This will appear if we con&s;ider the following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Place of Heaven is a glorious Place.</HI> Where this glorious and divine Place is, perhaps may not ab&s;olutely be determined; nor will it be &s;afe and decent for us to a&s;&s;ign any determinate Space in the Fields of Immen&s;ity, as the Spot where the Souls of good Men are made happy, when they leave this World. Whether we &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e dazling Courts of Immortality lie within the Limits of the blew Sky, that eludes the Penetration of our Sight; and to be di&s;po&s;ed &s;omewhere in that Firmament of Lu|minaries; or whether we imagine that happy City to &s;pread it &s;elf beyond the Circumference of our Creation; yet be it where it will, it is a Place of inconceivable Splen|dor and Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The very Heathen had a Notion of the Glory and Beau|ty of tho&s;e Regions to which good Men were carried af|ter their Death; and they u&s;ed to be very gay and orna|mental in their De&s;criptions of it. They &s;peak of it in their Writings as having all the Charms of Art and Nature to furni&s;h and &s;et it off. They tell us the Fields are in perpetual Verdure; the Hills are forever crown'd with Flowers; and the Trees at one Time blo&s;&s;om and bear Fruit: While the Meads are refre&s;hed with an innumerable Variety of cool and flowing Springs. Thus the heathen World u&s;ed to dre&s;s their Paradi&s;e, and paint it with all the Luxuriance of a lively Imagination. But how va&s;tly &s;hort are the&s;e Repre&s;entations to tho&s;e which we find made u&s;e of in the holy Writings, that give us a Pro&s;pect of the heavenly World?</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider what the &s;acred Scriptures relate concern|ing the Receptacle of the departed Spirits of the Saints, we &s;hall find &s;ufficient to convince us of the Truth of this.
<PB N="13" REF="005550_0011_10185BBDA7CEE330">
It is called a <HI>Hou&s;e of many Man&s;ions.</HI> John xiv. 2. <HI>A Building of God, an Hou&s;e not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens,</HI> 2 Cor. v. i. <HI>A City which hath Foundations, who&s;e Builder and who&s;e Maker is God,</HI> Heb. xi. 10. But the mo&s;t &s;u|blime and fini&s;h'd De&s;cription of it, we have in the xxi &s;t. Chapter of the Revelations, in which the holy City blazes in its greate&s;t Strength and Perfection. It is there built up after a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Manner, and &s;parkles with Gold and Jewels. The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of it, as &s;hining without the Aid of the Sun; as adorned with every Glory and Splendor: And indeed the Pomp and Riches of that City, is carried as far as our Imaginations can reach, in the Word of God; and the <HI>Re&s;t</HI> is glorious, becau&s;e the <HI>Place</HI> of it is glorious.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Company of Heaven is glorious Company.</HI> Heb. xii. 22, 23, 24. <HI>But ye are come to Mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly Jeru&s;alem, and to an innume|rable Company of Angels, to the general A&s;&s;embly and Church of the Fir&s;t-born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect, and to Je&s;us the Mediator of the new Covenant.</HI> There is &s;omething very beautiful and natural in this divine Rapture of the Apo&s;tle, that expre&s;&s;es more of the noble Tran&s;port he was in, than one would at fir&s;t imagine. He is &s;o taken up with the Theme, that he quite forgets the little Nice|ties of Method and Order, and produces the Images as they come to his Mind, without a &s;trict Regularity of A|rangement. He is ravi&s;h'd with the Thoughts of his Sub|ject, and is born away with the Current of Joy and De|light, that pours down upon him in his Contemplations. He begins his De&s;cription with the <HI>innumerable Company of Angels:</HI> Then he takes the whole Ho&s;t of Heaven toge|ther, and calls them, <HI>the general A&s;&s;embly and Church of the Fir&s;t-born:</HI> Next he ri&s;es to the great God him&s;elf, and
<PB N="14" REF="005550_0012_10185BC2A96D1270">
adores him as <HI>Judge of all:</HI> Then de&s;cends and tells of the <HI>Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect:</HI> La&s;tly, he again &s;oars a|way, and &s;ings of <HI>Je&s;us the Mediator.</HI> Thus the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle is &s;o full of the Matter, that he is hurried along with a holy Violence; and gives a more &s;trong and &s;u|blime Account of that glorious Company, by an artle&s;s and rapid Run of Thoughts, than if he had ob&s;erved the mo&s;t &s;crupulous and exact Order of Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>And &s;urely the <HI>Re&s;t</HI> that is fill'd with &s;uch divine Com|pany, mu&s;t be a glorious <HI>Re&s;t;</HI> and it is certainly no little Satisfaction that they afford one to another. What big Delight will it be, to go to that World, where we &s;hall &s;ee all the truly great and good Men that ever have lived up|on Earth! When <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>James,</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> &s;aw <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> at the Transfiguration of our Lord, how were they overpowered with the Extacy of the Vi&s;ion? Mark ix. 5. <HI>And</HI> Peter <HI>&s;aid, Ma&s;ter, it is good for us to be here: And let us make three Tabernacles, one for thee, and one for</HI> Mo&s;es, <HI>and one for</HI> Elias. If the Sight of one or two glo|rified Saints upon Earth, could cau&s;e the Hearts of the A|po&s;tles to beat with &s;uch a &s;olemn Delight, what will be the Satisfaction to go to the numerous A&s;&s;embly of Heaven, and &s;ee that dazling Company all glitter together.</P>
<P>But then, if the Sight of the holy Souls, will admini&s;ter &s;uch Joy, &s;urely the beholding &s;uch a radiant innumerable Company of Angels, mu&s;t fill us with a proportionable Glad|ne&s;s and Felicity. In the heavenly World, we &s;hall have a View of tho&s;e very Angels that we read of in the Scriptures, as de&s;cending on the Earth, with Me&s;&s;ages from God, and for the Service of his Children. There we &s;hall behold the Angel, that &s;wift as Lightning, &s;lew <HI>Senacharib</HI>'s Ar|my in one Night. There we &s;hall &s;ee tho&s;e Convoys that roll'd the Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI> up the Skies in a fiery Chariot. <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who clap'd his Wings, and &s;hot away like a

Ray of Light with the News of our Saviours Birth, will there attend upon the Throne of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us: While <HI>Michael,</HI> who drove down the rebel Angels thunder-&s;truck from the Battlements of Heaven, into the deep Aby&s;s of Damnation, will there move along thro' the Ranks of Seraphim, with the Port and A&s;pect of the Warriour Arch-angel. The Sight of &s;uch glorious Company as this, will be a ble&s;&s;ed and ravi&s;hing Sight indeed.</P>
<P>But O where &s;hall we find Words to expre&s;s the Bea|tifick Vi&s;ion of Chri&s;t? How ravi&s;hing, and glorious, and unutterable will that ble&s;&s;ed Lord appear, who is the <HI>Brightne&s;s of his Father's Glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on; and in whom dwelleth the Fullne&s;s of the God-head bodily!</HI> When the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> look'd upon Death in this Light, as only the Me&s;&s;enger that would call him to his dear Lord Je&s;us, how does he even pant, with an holy Impatience, for the pale Monarch to come on. No more is he afraid of that King of Terrors; no more does he &s;hrink back at his Approaches. He looks upon the Face of his Chri&s;t, and forgets the Horrors of Death: His Sting is blunted, his Darts broken; and that grim Tyrant of the Grave wears the A&s;pect of an Angel. 2 Cor. v. 6, 8. <HI>Wherefore we are always confident, knowing that while we are at Home in the Body, we are ab&s;ent from the Lord. &mdash; We are confident, I &s;ay, and willing rather to be ab&s;ent from the Body, and to be pre&s;ent with the Lord.</HI> Phil. i. 23. &mdash;<HI>Having a De&s;ire to depart and to be with Chri&s;t, which is by far better.</HI> Now if the Faith of going to Je&s;us, can in&s;pire &s;uch a Courage and Joy into the Mind of the good Man, and ba|ni&s;h the Shades from the Vale of Death; &s;urely the im|mediate Sight of that Glory will be tran&s;porting beyond Conception.</P>
<P>And indeed 'tis no little Part of the Happine&s;s of Hea|ven, that there we &s;hall behold the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
<PB N="16" REF="005550_0014_10185BC747FD0370">
unveil'd, in the full Bloom of heavenly Glory. This adds a Force and a Rapture to <HI>John</HI>'s De&s;cription of it, in the xxi&s;t and xxiid Chapters of the Revelations, <HI>And I &s;aw no Temple therein: For the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, are the Temple of it. And the City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to &s;hine in it: For the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. &mdash; And there &s;hall be no more Cur&s;e, but the Throne of God and of the Lamb &s;hall be in it, and his Servants &s;hall &s;erve him. And they &s;hall &s;ee his Face, and his Name &s;hall be in their Foreheads. And there &s;hall be no Night there, and they need no Candle, neither Light of the Sun, for the Lord God giveth them Light, and they &s;hall reign for ever and ever.</HI> Thus divinely glo|rious is the Company of Heaven: Holy Souls departed; Holy Angels, and God reveal'd in the Face of the holy Je&s;us, all con&s;pire to adorn the Kingdom, and &s;pread a Felicity over the whole Place.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Employment of Heaven is glorious Employment.</HI> As the Company is &s;o excellent and illu&s;trious, &s;o no le&s;s is the Conver&s;ation with which they gratify and entertain one another, in tho&s;e delightful Habitations. Doubtle&s;s tho&s;e happy Spirits will di&s;cour&s;e together, on the Actions of their pa&s;t Lives; the Ble&s;&s;ings they were favour'd with, the Mi&s;eries they are e&s;caped from; and Glory that they now po&s;&s;e&s;s. Tho&s;e that knew one another upon Earth, will be much better acquainted there; and where any have been in&s;trumental in forwarding and helping on one another in their Way to Heaven, they will be mutual Joys to one another when they meet there. How ble&s;&s;ed and plea&s;ing an Intercour&s;e mu&s;t it be, for Friends to con|gratulate the Arrival of Friends, to that holy World; to talk over the Prayers they have perhaps formerly made to|gether; the pious Conver&s;ation they have carried on upon Earth; and the &s;erious Religion they promoted in each o|ther's
<PB N="17" REF="005550_0015_10185BCA5DB7B638">
Minds, by their Word, and their Examples. It will certainly be no little Satisfaction, for them there to renew to one another, the Thoughts and Di&s;cour&s;es they once entertained concerning the Glory and Happine&s;s of the Kingdom where they will then reign. They will &s;ay one to another, How dark and ob&s;cure were our Concep|tions of this Felicity! How low and mean the Talk we formerly had about it! How inadequate and trifling the mo&s;t exalted Strokes of our mortal Di&s;cour&s;es to the&s;e &s;ublime Enjoyments!</P>
<P>And as the Conver&s;ation we &s;hall have with tho&s;e which we were familiar with on Earth, will be &s;o plea|&s;ant and happy, &s;o no le&s;s will that delight us, which we &s;hall have with tho&s;e who have gone to Heaven before us. To mix in the divine and &s;inle&s;s Companies there, to hear the improving Expre&s;&s;ions of their Tongues, and attend to the &s;oft Per&s;wa&s;ion that &s;its upon their Lips, this will be a very noble Entertainment. How glad &s;hall we be, to hear <HI>Paul</HI> give us an Account of his Conver&s;ion with his own Mouth; or <HI>Noah</HI> him&s;elf be the Relator of the Flood which bore him up in his Ark, over the Tops of the Mountains! To hear <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in an improved Sublimity of Style, tell of the Wonders of the Creation, and relate the Pomp and Terror of Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> when its Summit blaz'd with Fire unto the mid&s;t of Heaven; and the black Smoke aro&s;e like the Smoke of a Furnace, and roll'd a|way thro' the Air; while the Voice of the Trumpet echo'd louder and louder, and the whole Mountain &s;hook to its Foundations. And will not JESUS him&s;elf tell us of his own Love, and Sufferings for us, in <HI>Words which it is not lawful or po&s;&s;ible for a Man to utter.</HI> The&s;e noble Themes will without Doubt, employ much of the Conver|&s;ation of Heaven; and gratify and enlarge the Minds of the glorified Saints.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="005550_0016_10185BCEF9D16828">They will there al&s;o con&s;ider the &s;everal Works of God, and admire the &s;urprizing Di&s;plays of the Godhead in them.

Rev. iv. 10, 11. <HI>The four and twenty Elders fall down before him that &s;at on the Throne, and wor&s;hip him that liveth for ever and ever, and ca&s;t their Crowns before the Throne, &s;aying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glory, Honour, and Power, for thou ha&s;t created all Things, and for thy Plea&s;ure they are, and were created.</HI> To trace the Mazes of <HI>Providence,</HI> with exalted Strains of Rapture and Devotion, will be another Exer|ci&s;e of the heavenly World.

<P>In &s;ome De&s;criptions that the holy Writings give us of Heaven, we find the glorified Spirits celebrating the Prai&s;es of God, for his Judgments on Earth. Thus the De&s;truction of Antichri&s;t tunes their Harps, Rev. xix. 1,&mdash; 6. <HI>And after the&s;e Things I heard a great Voice of much Peo|ple in Heaven, &s;aying, Alleluia, Salvation, and Glory, and Honour, and Power unto the Lord our God; for true and righteous are his Judgments, for he hath judged the great Whore, which did corrupt the Air with her Fornication, and hath avenged the Blood of his Servants at her Hand. And a|gain they &s;aid Alleluia, and her Smoke ro&s;e up for ever and ever. And the four and twenty Elders, and the four Bea&s;ts fell down and wor&s;hipped God that &s;at on the Throne, &s;aying, Amen, Alleluia. And a Voice came out of the Throne: &s;ay|ing, Prai&s;e our God all ye his Servants, and ye that fear him, both &s;mall and great. And I heard as it were the Voice of a

We &s;hall there be &s;wallow'd up with the Contemplation of that my&s;terious and un|&s;earchable Production. Rev. v. 8, 9. <HI>The four living Creatures, and four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them Harps, and golden Vials full of Odours, which are the Prayers of Saints. And they &s;ung a new &s;ong, &s;aying, Thou art worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof: For thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t Thing we &s;hall take Notice of under this Head, &s;hall be, That one principal Part of the heavenly Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s will con&s;i&s;t in the beholding of GOD. This will be no &s;mall Article of the Employment and Felicity of the Saints in Glory; but will improve and brighten every other Delight. Not that we are to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible to have a Sight of the divine E&s;&s;ence it &s;elf; but &s;uch a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his Pre&s;ence, and &s;uch Communications from him, as may in &s;ome Sen&s;e be e&s;teemed Sight; and this is what is called <HI>the beatifick Vi&s;ion.</HI> It is in this Sen&s;e that tho&s;e Texts of the holy Scriptures are to be under&s;tood, that &s;peak of <HI>beholding the Face of God,</HI> and <HI>&s;eeing him as he is.</HI> The Eye of the Under&s;tanding, has a View of the glorious God, and gra&s;ps in as much of the glorious Pro&s;|pect, as it can po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h. Thus divine and happy are the Exerci&s;es of the heavenly World.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The Progre&s;&s;ion and Increa&s;e of that cele&s;tial Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s, will add perpetually to its tran&s;cendant Glory.</HI> The Saints do not immediately upon their Entrance into Para|di&s;e, &s;hoot up to the highe&s;t Point of Felicity and Ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s,

but go on continually making new Aqui&s;itions in Knowledge, and enlarging their Capacities for Happi|ne&s;s. This may be proved by plain and evident Argu|ments; and particularly from the Make and Con&s;titution of the humane Soul. The Mind of Man is like a Fire, which &s;preads and encrea&s;es as it finds Materials to feed and &s;upply it. So that tho' the Spirit of a Believer, as &s;oon as it arrives to tho&s;e Realms of Tranquility, re|ceives as much Joy and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s as it is then capable of, yet it is not happy in &s;o great a Degree, as it will be afterwards, becau&s;e it will then be able to &s;upport, and bear up under, a larger Proportion of Glory. When the Soul of a good Man has enjoy'd the Felicity of Heaven for &s;ome long Period of Duration, every Faculty will be widen'd, and many additional Advantages will nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e, as the Soul &s;preads it &s;elf into more ample Capa|cities. Tho' the Spirit of the Believer is made perfect in Holine&s;s and Glory, as &s;oon as it leaves the Body, yet it does not arrive to tho&s;e <HI>greater Degrees</HI> of Perfection, that it will &s;till go on to acquire, as it &s;inks further into the Depths of Eternity. The Memory will then be an inexhau&s;tible Magazine of Delight, as they pa&s;s onward thro' the va&s;t Variety of Satisfactions that they meet with in the heavenly World: And they will be able to look back, and reflect with renewed Joy upon that wonder|ful Train of Plea&s;ures, which has extended it &s;elf in &s;uch a beautiful Order, and to &s;o immen&s;e a Di&s;tance. And to think over &s;uch a mighty Round of Years, and renew in our Minds all the plea&s;ing Scenes of Felicity, which pa&s;s'd in a gay Succe&s;&s;ion before us, in &s;o great a Space of Duration, mu&s;t needs be an Happine&s;s which will be un|&s;peakably great; and impo&s;&s;ible to be enjoy'd at our fir&s;t Entrance into Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="005550_0019_10185BD58F0D0ED0">But to di&s;mi&s;s a Speculation &s;o ab&s;tracted, we may here take Notice of two Steps of Progre&s;&s;ion, which every one will allow at fir&s;t Sight, that the Souls of good Men take in their glorious Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, At their Death. They no &s;ooner leave their dy|ing Bodies, but they are borne upon the Wings of holy Angels to the Paradi&s;e of God. A Flight of tho&s;e &s;hining Spirits attend the Death-Bed of the Saints, and imme|diately upon the la&s;t Ga&s;p, receive the departing Soul, and convoy it to the World of Glory. If our Minds could but follow them as they fly along, what a wonder|ful Scene of Delight would open to us? How does a Soul ju&s;t freed from a Body of Sin and Death, exult as it tow'rs away, in the Mid&s;t of &s;uch bright Attendants? How do the re&s;plendent Angel-Guards &s;ing round it, as they bear it thro' the Regions of the Air, and the Ether, to the Habitations of unfading Bli&s;s and Triumph! And when it enters the orient Gates of that City, what are the Acclamations and Hallelujahs that congratulate its &s;afe Arrival! Here it joins its Brethren of the Skies, in their immortal Anthems of Rapture and Prai&s;e, in a joyful Hope and Expectation of the Re&s;urrection of the Dead at the la&s;t Day.</P>
<P>And this is a &s;econd Step of the Believer's Progre&s;&s;ion in Glory, which is acknowledged by all, without He&s;ita|tion or Pau&s;e. When our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t makes his &s;econd Appearing, <HI>the Dead in Chri&s;t &s;hall ari&s;e,</HI> and tho&s;e Souls who have been many Ages happy in the Paradi&s;e of God, &s;hall now attain to a more compleat and exten|&s;ive Felicity at the Re&s;urrection of their re&s;pective Bodies; which will be glorified and adorn'd for the Habitation of &s;o &s;inle&s;s Spirits. It will without Di&s;pute, be a mo&s;t glo|rious Advancement in Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, for the rai&s;ed Bodies of the Saints, to be again united to the Soul, and become
<PB N="22" REF="005550_0020_10185BD720CE73E8">
more intimate and in&s;eparable Companions than ever they were before. How will the ravi&s;h'd Soul of the good Man triumph, when he hears the Voice of the Son of God, <HI>Ari&s;e ye Dead!</HI> How will his quickning Body re|joice, at the new Entry of the Spirit into it! The whole Man will be &s;wallowed up in an unknown Delight: His Heart will leap with Tran&s;port in his Bo&s;om, and beat Time to the &s;ounding Echo's of the la&s;t Trumpet. Thus when our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall <HI>come, to be glorified in his Saints, and admired of all them that believe,</HI> the Language of the holy Soul, as it flies down to the Grave that con|tains its Du&s;t, will be, <HI>Ari&s;e, O my</HI> Body, <HI>ari&s;e and &s;hine, for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is ri&s;en upon thee.</HI></P>
<P>I might add to the&s;e two Steps in the Throne of Glory, a Third, <HI>viz.</HI> that after the final Judgment, the deathle&s;s Bodies and Souls of the Children of God, will in an in|di&s;&s;oluble Union, a&s;cend to the heavenly World, with new Additions of Splendor, and Pomp, and Happine&s;s. But, alas! What Words can bear up under this <HI>Weight of Glory.</HI> What Conceptions are equal to this dazling Solemnity, and Magnificence. When the Judge of the World, ri&s;es from his la&s;t Sentence on the Righteous and the Wicked, and returns to his Throne in the Heavens, who can tell the Joys of the glorified Saints, and the Songs of Thank&s;giving that hang on their Lips? They will &s;hout round his Chariot Wheels, as they roll along, and all Heaven will re&s;ound with their Acclamations. Thus will they enter the Place of their holy and glorious A|bodes, and receive a higher Degree of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, than ever they were before capable of imagining.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee there is a Progre&s;&s;ion of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s en|joy'd by the Saints in Glory. At Death they are made perfect in Happine&s;s; At the Re&s;urrection they arrive at
<PB N="23" REF="005550_0021_10185BDD8569C5D0">
an additional Felicity, by a Re-union to their glorified Bodies; At their A&s;cen&s;ion to the Man&s;ions of Delights, after the Conclu&s;ion of the great Day, they arrive at &s;till higher and nobler Degrees of Perfection; and they then go on adding Joy to Joy, and one Degree of Glory to another to interminable Ages.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The Duration of the Re&s;t remaining for the People of God in the heavenly World, will be an inconceivable Addition to the Glory of it.</HI> And what is this Duration but even Eter|nity it &s;elf? Had it been but a few Years, that the glo|rified Saints were to enjoy the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of Heaven, yet even then it would beyond Expre&s;&s;ion have &s;urpa&s;s'd all the Plea&s;ures of this Earth. But what an infinite Addi|tion of Happine&s;s is given to the tran&s;ported Souls there, by the Con&s;tancy and La&s;tingne&s;s of the Glory! What &s;trange Delight does that Reflection &s;trike into the Mind of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ed? Eternity! How does it employ their Thoughts, how does it even overwhelm and &s;wallow up all their Contemplations, in Delight and Wonder! It not only continues the Felicity without Ce&s;&s;ation, but it en|crea&s;es it every Moment. For when the Soul a&s;&s;ures it &s;elf, that the Happine&s;s it enjoys &s;hall endure forever, that very Thought doubles every Delight which tolls in upon it; and gives a new and an unknown Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to every Plea&s;ure of Heaven. Were the happy Spirits in Paradi&s;e to know that their Joys were in &s;ome Period of Duration to be fini&s;hed; and that the they mu&s;t leave their Glory, how would it damp their Felicity, and ca&s;t a Veil and a Cloud upon all their Raptures? How di&s;tant &s;oever the End might be, it would methinks &s;till be pre&s;ent to their Minds; and, like a Man po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of an invaluable Trea|&s;ure, the very Fear of loo&s;ing it, would in a great Mea|&s;ure ob&s;truct the pre&s;ent Comfort it might otherwi&s;e af|ford. In a Word, Did the ble&s;&s;ed Saints know that the
<PB N="24" REF="005550_0022_10185BE269F6C858">
Time would arrive, in which he mu&s;t part with all his Hap|pine&s;s, the very Thought would blunt the fine Edge of his Delight; and would &s;pread a Gloom, never before con|fe&s;s'd in tho&s;e Realms of immortal Day. Our Lord Je&s;us him&s;elf cried out at his Father's Withdraw from him. And in like Manner, on the other Hand, the Me|ditation of the Eternity of the Enjoyments of the hea|venly World, infu&s;es new Satisfaction in every Moment that rolls thro' tho&s;e golden Ages. It doubles every Plea|&s;ure they ta&s;te; and gives an additional Splendor to every Gem in the Crown of Glory. Dan. xii. 3. <HI>They that be wi&s;e, &s;hall &s;hine as the Brightne&s;s of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the Stars forever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we have con&s;ider'd the heavenly Re&s;t, and &s;hown, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, how it was glorious. That every Thing we could &s;ay of it, was to its Advantage and its Honour. That the <HI>Place,</HI> the <HI>Company,</HI> the <HI>Employment,</HI> the <HI>Progre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and the <HI>Duration,</HI> all unite their Beauties together, and con&s;pire to &s;et it off with the utmo&s;t Pomp and Magnificence. But alas, how little a Portion is known of it. To &s;peak of the Glories of Heaven fully, who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e Things! What the Perfection of it will be, we know not now, we &s;hall know here|after. Fitter are the&s;e Themes for the <HI>Hallelujahs</HI> of a Seraph, than the faultring Tongue of a Mortal; better to be admired than de&s;cribed; to dwell forever in an holy Meditation upon our Hearts, to influence every Action we perform, and at la&s;t, to make our very <HI>Deaths</HI> the mo&s;t delightful and ravi&s;hing Moment of our <HI>Lives. Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard; neither hath the Heart of Man a&s;cended to conceive the Glory which God hath prepared for them who love him.</HI></P>

What a Shame is it, that &s;o trifling and tran&s;ient a Re&s;t in this World, &s;hould have &s;tronger Allurements than the eter|nal Tranquility of Paradi&s;e? Can the Chri&s;tian bear the Thoughts of This: To be thus out-done in Labour, upon &s;o &s;lender a Foundation, &s;o trifling a Reward?</P>
<P>Let every Soul of us then receive the Exhortation of the Apo&s;tle, Heb. iv. 11. <HI>Let us Labour therefore to enter into that Re&s;t.</HI> And let every <HI>pious Soul</HI> in particular,

In this World, they are &s;till pur&s;uing imaginary Fantoms of Happine&s;s, with con&s;tant Pains and Application; till at la&s;t Death &s;eizes them in the Mid&s;t of their eager Pur&s;uits, and con&s;igns them over to the World of Fire and Torment.</P>
<P>Tis in this mi&s;erable Place, that Sleep flies their aching Eye-lids; and Re&s;t and Ea&s;e are utter Strangers. Alas! What Hope of a peaceful Lodging in a Bed of Flames? What Expectation of a quiet Abode in tho&s;e di&s;mal Re|gions of Sorrow! If they ca&s;t their Eyes towards Heaven, they do but Cur&s;e God and look upwards. <HI>They &s;ee</HI> the beauteous Realms of <HI>Hallelujah,</HI> and the Doors of the holy City clo&s;ed again&s;t them with everla&s;ting Bars. <HI>They feel</HI> the kindling Torment inflame their impious Tongues; and plead in vain for a Drop of Water. <HI>They hear</HI> the Sentence thundred from the Mouth of the great God him&s;elf, <HI>He that is unju&s;t, let him be unju&s;t &s;till. He that is filthy, let him be filthy &s;till.</HI> Their un&s;ufferable Condition has a very awful De&s;cription, Rev. xiv. 10, 11. <HI>They &s;hall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out without Mixture, into the Cup of his Indignation, and they &s;hall be tormented with Fire and Brim&s;tone, in the Pre&s;ence of the holy Angels, and in the Pre&s;ence of the Lamb: And the Smoke of their Torment a&s;cendeth up forever and ever: And they have</HI> NO REST <HI>Day nor Night.</HI> Darkne&s;s is indeed a Sea&s;on for Re&s;t; But tho' they are bani&s;hed in|to utter Darkne&s;s; into Blackne&s;s of Darkne&s;s forever; yet are they ignorant of any Re&s;t; they know no Ce&s;&s;a|tion
<PB N="28" REF="005550_0026_10185BECC34474D0">
to their De&s;pair and Angui&s;h. As their Flames give them no Light, their eternal Night affords them no Sleep. They &s;pend the gloomy Ages that roll over them in Lamentation and Woe: They rore, loud as the Fires that wave about them; and are unquiet and re&s;tle&s;s as they.</P>
<P>There is a dreadful Di&s;parity between the Puni&s;hments of Damnation, and the Glories of Heaven, and this will &s;erve to &s;how the Wretchedne&s;s of the Wicked there. Is the <HI>Place</HI> of Heaven &s;o ble&s;&s;ed and divine, Hell is com|pared to a Pri&s;on, to a bottomle&s;s Pit, to a Place of Tor|ment, to a horrible Furnace, and to a burning Oven. I&s;ai. xxx. 33. <HI>The Lord hath prepared Tophet of old,&mdash;He hath made it deep and large: The Pile thereof is Fire and much Wood, the Breath of the Lord, like a Stream of Brim|&s;tone, doth kindle it.</HI></P>
<P>In like Manner, the <HI>Company</HI> of Hell al&s;o, what a hideous and infernal <HI>Company!</HI> Nothing to conver&s;e with, but Devils and the Damned. Their Fellow-Sinners upon the Earth, will be their Fellow-Sufferers in Hell; and tho&s;e who formerly were Partners in Guilt, will now become Sharers in Torment. Satan who once tempted them, and their Companions who harden'd them in Sin, will add to their future Mi&s;ery, and blow up the Flames to a grea|ter Vigour upon them. The Sentence that will break upon them from the Mouth of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and that will &s;weep them down to Perdition, will be that, Matth. xxv. 41. <HI>Depart from me ye Cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> Mi&s;erable Souls! to be <HI>con&s;umed from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and the Glory of his Power.</HI> To be bani&s;hed from the ble&s;&s;ed Company of Heaven, and of Je&s;us the Glory of Heaven; while a Portion is a&s;&s;igned unto them with <HI>Hypocrites and
<PB N="29" REF="005550_0027_10185BEFC6CAA1D8">
Unbelievers,</HI> where is <HI>Weeping, and Wailing, and gna&s;hing of Teeth,</HI> without Remedy, without Mea&s;ure, and without End. The unhappy Company is de&s;cribed, Rev. xxi. 8. <HI>But the Fearful, and Unbelieving, and the Abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolators, and all Liars, &s;hall have their Part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd Death.</HI></P>
<P>Again, The <HI>Employment</HI> of Hell, what is it, but the keen Reflections of their pa&s;t Lives, and a future Eter|nity? What but bitter Out-cries and Execrations, while they cur&s;e one another, and bla&s;pheme God? In&s;tead of the Anthems of Heaven, they pour out Groans, and Shrieks, and Ejulations. They gnaw their Tongues for Pain; and howling &s;upplies the Place of Hallelujah.</P>
<P>Again, The Pains of Hell have a horrible <HI>Progre&s;&s;ion:</HI> and as a Fire kindles by Degrees, and at la&s;t Blazes with the large&s;t Expan&s;ion, and the inten&s;e&s;t Heat; &s;o it will be with the Flames of Hell. We &s;ee great Pains, the longer they la&s;t, become the more intollerable. Where then will be the Sinner's Patience, after Millions of Ages &s;pent in tho&s;e tremendous Agonies! How will his <HI>Memo|ry, Faithful Tormentor!</HI> look back into the pa&s;t Periods of De&s;pair, and renew all the dreadful La&s;hes of that va&s;t Duration. How will he e&s;&s;ay to mea&s;ure the never-end|ing Succe&s;&s;ion to come, as the Line of preceeding Mi&s;e|ries lengthens out further and further. His <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> will be a wider Affliction, as he comes by the dire Experiment better to <HI>know the Power of almighty Anger.</HI> His <HI>Affections,</HI> particularly that of <HI>Fear,</HI> will be a more &s;tinging Anxiety, after he has felt in &s;ome Sort, what he will hereafter ex|pect to be more violent and in&s;upportable. His <HI>Will</HI> will grow more de&s;perate and hardened, as he &s;till u&s;es him&s;elf to unpardonable Bla&s;phemies. Finally, His <HI>Imagination</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="005550_0028_10185BF3EF6A7D20">
will grow more unhappily capacious &amp; artfull, to repre&s;ent his Condition of pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, &amp; to come, in the mo&s;t lively and amazing Colours. But to draw on to a Conclu&s;ion, in the la&s;t Place the <HI>Duration</HI> of the Torments of Hell, is, <HI>All Eter|nity.</HI> What a boundle&s;s and overpowering Conception is here! The Mi&s;eries of the Damned will la&s;t for ever. Never will tho&s;e undone Souls be able to break Pri&s;on; never will their Agonies cea&s;e, or the Wrath of God give over raging again&s;t them. The Day of the Fiercene&s;s of almighty Anger being come, it will remain, and the In|dignation of God will ru&s;h down re&s;i&s;tle&s;s and ince&s;&s;ant upon the guilty Rebels, and beat upon them in an eternal Tempe&s;t. Eternity! it adds Weight to every Chain, Heat to every Coal, and Gloom to every Cloud in that doleful Vault. It not only continues their Angui&s;h with|out End, but encrea&s;es it every Moment. When they look forward into its un&s;earchable Mazes, and loo&s;e them|&s;elves in the &s;trange Exten&s;ion, O the Lamentation! O the De&s;pair! it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to form any equal Con|ception of it.</P>
<P>Inf. IV. And I have done, Is <HI>this Re&s;t Chri&s;t</HI>'s Re&s;t, as I have hinted, O let us all go to him for it. If we refu&s;e to do this, we &s;hall be mi&s;erable forever. <HI>For there is no other Name given under Heaven, whereby we can be &s;aved.</HI> He is the mighty Saviour. But <HI>how &s;hall we e&s;cape if we neglect &s;o great Salvation.</HI> All Things el&s;e will fail us. We may wander among the Creatures, like <HI>Noah</HI>'s Dove along the Surface of the Flood, but like her &s;hall find no REST <HI>to the Sole of our Foot,</HI> till we return to this Ark. <HI>Gen.</HI> viii. 9. But if we repair to him by an humble Faith, we &s;hall there have Re&s;t in the Day of Trouble. The greate&s;t Sinner of us all is Welcome here; and no|thing but our Unbelief can hinder our Acceptance with
<PB N="31" REF="005550_0029_10185BF581948698">
him. Our eternal <HI>Re&s;t</HI> or <HI>Torment</HI> depends then upon this one Thing, whether we are willing to give our &s;elves to Chri&s;t or no. If we believe on his Name, we &s;hall have &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions infu&s;ed into our own Souls, as will be a Heaven begun; and an Earne&s;t of the Re&s;t to follow. If not, we &s;hall not be qualified for it; nor can we enjoy it. For without Holine&s;s no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord, nor en|ter into the Re&s;t of his People. How fooli&s;h are tho&s;e mi&s;erable Souls, who after &s;o many Invitations to accept of the Re&s;t of Heaven, go away unre&s;olved whether to &s;trive for it or no; refu&s;e it, and de&s;pi&s;e it? Who can &s;ay but if you now think to put it off, and delay your Endea|vours after it, an angry God may for ever bani&s;h you from it. Are you &s;ure you &s;hall ever have another Opportunity to &s;ue for Mercy? Nay, Death may &s;trip you of all be|fore To-morrow. What is the Language of the holy God upon &s;uch Procra&s;tination? Heb. iii. 7, 8, 10, 11. <HI>Wherefore &s;aith the holy Gho&s;t, To day, if ye will hear his Voice harden not your Hearts.&mdash; They do always err in their Hearts, and they have not known my Ways. So I &s;ware in my Wrath, they &s;hall not enter into my Re&s;t.</HI> But to tho&s;e who with penitent Eyes, and awakened Souls enquire, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved; to be delivered from this Wrath to come,</HI> and obtain this glorious Re&s;t? To tho&s;e I an&s;wer (yet not I, but the Lord JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf) in that mo&s;t divine and affecting Language, Matth. xi. 28, 29. <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Re&s;t. Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye &s;hall find Re&s;t unto your Souls.</HI> And will you not echo to the dear Voice, <HI>Re|turn unto thy Re&s;t, O my Soul.</HI></P>
