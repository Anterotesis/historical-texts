</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is the laudible purpo&s;e of our in&s;titution, by the mo&s;t agreeable means, to expand our hearts for all the offices of humanity. It does not de&s;troy, nor even weaken the love of private intere&s;t, of kindred, nations, or
<PB N="6" REF="031799_0004_0FEE7291B5AA01B0">opinions. It is intended to a&s;&s;i&s;t a generous energy of mind, in ri&s;ing to the highe&s;t obli|gations of charity. It accompli&s;hes its end, by creating a &s;ociety, in which we familiarize its &s;pecial duties, by a voluntary a&s;&s;ociation with all parts of the family into which we en|ter. The &s;tronge&s;t prejudices are &s;uch only as exi&s;t in every kindred, which has a duty and affection, not directed by pure character, but by an e&s;tabli&s;hed, immutable, and public relation. We embrace friends through the world. He that is fir&s;t in &s;uch a family among brethren, &s;hould be &s;ocial in his di&s;po&s;ition, open in his temper, &s;afe in his habits, firm in his character, and reputable in the world. To de&s;erve this preference, and to receive it, mu&s;t be the highe&s;t honour. From the per|&s;ua&s;ion or this truth, my Brethren, I ri&s;e with cheerfulne&s;s, in the &s;ervice you have a&s;|&s;igned me, in bearing your public te&s;timony to this &s;entiment. We are Brethren. Duties belong to each; but different duties to all. The wi&s;dom of the head; the &s;incerity of the heart; the benevolence of the temper; the quickne&s;s of the &s;en&s;es; and the organic life, in each part, form the perfection of the
<PB N="7" REF="031799_0005_0FEE729343E29548">whole. But all the&s;e parts have not the &s;ame office, nor the &s;ame re&s;ources. If the head be &s;ound, each faculty more readily finds its full employment and u&s;e. The head, then, is the mo&s;t honourable. Equal as are all friend&s;hips, with &s;ociety, we begin a nece&s;&s;ary &s;ubordination. And as this is more perfect and happy, we flouri&s;h and are ble&s;&s;ed. The choice of the man then, and not of the ma&s;|ter, is voluntary. The man may be changed, but the Ma&s;ter is perpetual. He is created by our nece&s;&s;ity, and we owe him the full obedience of our Love. In the duties of his office he is the &s;oul of our in&s;titution; and while he lives in our reverence of him, we live al&s;o. To judge of that wi&s;dom, we may employ in the choice, we mu&s;t be &s;ure of the <HI>character, object, manners, and form</HI> of Free Ma&s;onry.</P>
<P N="1">I. As the whole character of man is from education, under various names, &s;o there are in&s;titutions to a&s;&s;i&s;t this education. They have various objects. They a&s;&s;i&s;t to devellope the faculties; to in&s;truct in the arts; to form manners; to promote knowledge; to pre&s;erve
<PB N="8" REF="031799_0006_0FEE7294CC2F5E98">the affections; or to teach religion. They ari&s;e from private choice, or from the autho|rity of Laws. They are adapted to private, or public ends. Some are de&s;igned to reform mankind, others to unite them. Some to find greater re&s;ources in human nature, and &s;ome to keep what we have already gotten. Some to &s;eparate the wi&s;e and good from the re&s;t of mankind, and &s;ome to promote the general good. Our own is de&s;igned to bring all the &s;ocial affections away from the cares of life; and the partialities of private friend&s;hip, into the &s;ervice of our common nature. We pre|fer no man's religion. We examine no laws of any country. We &s;peak in no language: and take names from no party. We belong to every thing &s;incere and &s;ocial in the hu|man heart. We explore the imperfection of no character, which can be tolerated by the laws of any country. All men who have the heart to be &s;ocial, and the power to be kind, we love. The gay we do not de&s;pi&s;e. The follies which violate no laws of life and manners, we forget. We mix our plea&s;ures with every innocent gaiety of the &s;ong; and we become cheerful at the flowing bowl, and
<PB N="9" REF="031799_0007_0FEE729A054E94E0">the table. We take men as we find them, di&s;po&s;ed to live in the happine&s;s of each other. Such is the <HI>Character</HI> of Free Ma&s;onry.</P>
<P N="2">II. But to guard our in&s;titution from abu&s;e, we have a generous object always before us. We cha&s;e away all envy, competition, and &s;trife. We have our brethren every where in the family of mankind: we therefore de&s;|pi&s;e no cu&s;toms, in&s;ult no laws, and hate no country. To know our brethren is our de|light; to a&s;&s;i&s;t them is our glory. Our wealth, beyond our own wants, is &s;acred to their u&s;e. To point out the path of life, and make it happy, is our &s;ublime wi&s;dom. We cannot be friends of &s;ociety, if we violate any of its laws. To be honourable among ma&s;ons, we mu&s;t have honour from every &s;ocial obli|gation. We have too great a &s;hare in the public happine&s;s, to &s;eparate from it. We cannot be mi&s;erable, becau&s;e every man's happine&s;s is our own. Cheerful, we are &s;ure to be content; and, as far as we are able, we provide for perpetual peace. Dome&s;tic life has its chief joys from our friend&s;hip; and indu&s;try its greate&s;t guards from our love.
<PB N="10" REF="031799_0008_0FEE729B91168EB8">We know no man, but in his capacity for happine&s;s; and we have no duty to him, but to enlarge it. Such is the <HI>object</HI> of our in&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P N="3">III. We are not in&s;en&s;ible of the liablene&s;s of our in&s;titution to abu&s;e, and we know that the abu&s;es of all in&s;titutions have a cha|racter from the nature of them. How in|e&s;timable are the advantages of religion! Of living in the love of God! But how many fanatics and bigots, devotees and my&s;tics, are recounted in the hi&s;tory of every religion. We furni&s;h none of the&s;e; we &s;hun them. But, while the pa&s;&s;ions live in our world in &s;ad perver&s;ion, we dare not pretend, that our brethren have not been betrayed. We pre|tend to nothing above human nature. We take propen&s;ities as we find them, and we aim to render them u&s;eful. We take the man in the gay hour, when his coun|tenance is cheered by the congratulations of his friends; his &s;pirits elevated by mirth, and the &s;ong; when fancy is &s;portive, and amu&s;e|ments are ready; and while he is exhilirated at the fea&s;t of joy. The&s;e are &s;cenes from which the gay will not be excluded. They
<PB N="11" REF="031799_0009_0FEE729E5C46DC70">may be rendered the innocent plea&s;ures of &s;ocial life. They are not &s;ought with equal delight in every place. The gla&s;s is never filled in the ma&s;ter's pre&s;ence in &s;ome places, but at the fe&s;tivals; and the &s;ong is &s;eldom heard among &s;ome brethren, but in the jocund hour, when the Lodge is &s;hut. The&s;e plea|&s;ures are indulgences, not Laws: of choice, not of obligation. And if we &s;ometimes ex|ceed the bounds, which decency and good manners appoint, it is not becau&s;e we do not profe&s;s an abhorrence of every thing contrary to the pure&s;t laws of life. We lament what we cannot correct. And in a faithful ma&s;ter, we have the &s;ure&s;t re&s;traints upon our gaye&s;t plea&s;ures. Our dangers are from the activity of our &s;pirits, and from the unbounded effu&s;i|ons of a cheerful hour. Profu&s;ion waits upon the &s;teps of jollity, and plea&s;ure often de&s;|pi&s;es intere&s;t. A ma&s;ter watches over his Lodge: he commands, and he is always obeyed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE <HI>form</HI> of the in&s;titution can be known only to the brethren. There is no|thing, which the mo&s;t refined delicacy might not behold. The &s;olemn addre&s;&s;es at initi|ation
<PB N="12" REF="031799_0010_0FEE729FE9146738">are before the world. We publi&s;h our Con&s;titutions, Regulations, In&s;tructions, and general Laws; and even our free&s;t mirth; and from the&s;e we may appeal to an impartial world, whether tho&s;e are not good principles we profe&s;s. We ju&s;tify the u&s;e of every rite, of every form and ceremony, which can aid the local prejudices of religion or virtue. And the di&s;cretion gives no offence. We tru&s;t that the &s;cene of this day will &s;trengthen the convictions, that there are no obligations unworthy of a good man, and that the pre|&s;ence of the wi&s;e would be a de&s;ireable ble&s;|&s;ing to Free Ma&s;onry.</P>
<P>THE Symbols we di&s;play, have been vari|ou&s;ly interpreted. We publi&s;h them not for curio&s;ity, but for ceremony. They are em|ployed not for &s;uper&s;tition, but for u&s;e. All con&s;tructions favourable to moral life are in|dulged, rather to remove prejudices abroad, than to define their character within the Lodge. They are free for di&s;qui&s;ition, while they contribute to no di&s;&s;ention. To avoid the charge of ob&s;curity, we &s;hall not enter upon any particular explanation. It is enough, that the &s;crutiny of an antiquarian may re|port
<PB N="13" REF="031799_0011_0FEF288E7B8872B0">that they are the mo&s;t early emblems of wi&s;dom, and &s;uch as may be found among all antient nations. A Bryant might di&s;cover the &s;ymbols of Egypt, as an Hutche&s;on has of Pythagoras, as well as of the antient my&s;tics. They betray to the &s;cholar no proofs of modern times, for their invention is as old as &s;cience it&s;elf. They have been con|founded with the emblems in the my&s;teries of Greece, and con&s;tantly traced to geometry and philo&s;ophy. A &s;trong re&s;emblance in the antient gems has forced it&s;elf upon the notice of the mo&s;t cur&s;ory ob&s;erver. It is enough, if they be faithful in communicating their de|&s;ign through the world.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e remarks upon Free Ma&s;onry, it may be &s;oon apparent, how much will de|pend on the <HI>Lectures</HI> of a Lodge, and con&s;e|quently how much upon a faithful <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Wardens.</HI> It may then be expected that every brother, who a&s;&s;umes an office, by the con&s;ent of a Lodge, will &s;acredly attend to his charge. Every officer ought to be a calm, friendly, and benevolent man. An exten&s;ive
<PB N="14" REF="031799_0012_0FEF282244802920">knowledge of the brethren ought to be his de|&s;ire, but he certainly ought to know the charac|ter and habits of all in his own Lodge. The difference between well governed Lodges, and all other Lodges, is the greate&s;t to be imagin|ed. Nothing &s;hould be &s;uffered which can provoke, alarm, or excite prejudice. The of|fice of Charity is to keep every &s;uch thing from a Lodge. Unle&s;s then the ma&s;ter can ri&s;e above the di&s;tinctions of &s;ects in religion, while he has an e&s;tabli&s;hed character in the public opinion; unle&s;s he is &s;uperior to par|ties in the &s;tate; unle&s;s he can freely con|ver&s;e with all the brethren, without regard to the competitions of private life; unle&s;s he can be indulgent to particular manners and tempers, to cu&s;toms, with which he cannot comply, and to amu&s;ements, he cannot pre|fer; he will never diffu&s;e a generous joy around him. All hearts will not be united. All prejudices will be active. Cheerfulne&s;s will not lean on partial kindne&s;s; nor fel|low&s;hip &s;it with di&s;grace. Brethren will not &s;uffer their charity to be degraded by their opinions, nor by their names.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="031799_0013_0FEF2823CADA3A90">
FOR voluntary a&s;&s;ociations, we require &s;uch men to hold offices, as can be punctual, active, and ready in all the &s;ervices of their &s;tation: to whom the pro&s;perity of the Lodge is the highe&s;t reward, and who&s;e mea&s;ure of duty, is not from what others have done, but from a di&s;po&s;ition to do all the good in their pow|er. Happy indeed will it be, if the dome&s;tic and &s;ocial character of a Ma&s;ter be lovely in the world, and in&s;pire confidence in his bene|volence. After &s;uch a delineation of our character, our brethren in this vicinity will not doubt of the nature of our advice and charge in the&s;e &s;olemnities.</P>
<P>LET me then &s;ay to our Brethren of WASHINGTON LODGE; In this &s;ocial in&s;titu|tion you have the indulgence of all the inno|cent pa&s;&s;ions, and all the incentives of gene|rous affections. You may unbend in &s;ocial glee, catch the &s;weet &s;ympathy of plea&s;ure, and &s;hare it with fullne&s;s of &s;oul. And while you rejoice in, you ought to urge a friendly zeal, and even an enthu&s;ia&s;m to defend, a friend&s;hip you thus honourably enjoy.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="031799_0014_0FEF284228D9F648">
TO &s;ecure a ma&s;on's heart, he ought to have a &s;incere temper, and the habits of good will. Our friend&s;hip is not begun in di&s;in|tere&s;ted love. We have an intere&s;t in each other. There is too little of this love in the world, not to induce doubts of the &s;trength of it, in many who profe&s;s it. The little to be found, which re&s;embles it, agrees too well with the nature of our habits, to be ac|counted for, more ea&s;ily, on any other prin|ciples. Con&s;tancy, then, is a virtue of a flouri&s;hing Lodge. It is only while we keep near the Lodge, we are Ma&s;ons.</P>
<P>MASONS, as brethren, ought to be careful to receive only tho&s;e who appear <HI>good men and true.</HI> What we gain from prejudice, is not &s;ure gain. To open our arms to the di&s;gra|ced or the di&s;contented of any &s;ociety, is to degrade our&s;elves and make the injured our enemies. This will give a triumph to their zeal, and ju&s;tify their invectives. He that is not at peace with all the world, cannot be at peace with us. He that de&s;pi&s;es and vio|lates any profe&s;&s;ion, will certainly di&s;honour us.</P>
<P><PB REF="031799_0015_0FEF2847B235D9F0">
MASONS ought not only to regard the cha|racter of men, but their <HI>di&s;po&s;itions.</HI> An in-in&s;titution may be adapted to pre&s;erve virtue, which is not fit to create it. The man who profits &s;o little from life, as to have no lovely virtues, will be a tax upon us. He who does not conform to the approved manners and laws of a country, wants the fir&s;t principles of friend&s;hip, and mu&s;t prove a di&s;grace to us.</P>
<P>MASONS ought al&s;o to confirm their inte|re&s;t in each other. As the &s;ocial principle be|comes more &s;trong from the intere&s;t we have in each other, in our whole character, we mu&s;t have the greate&s;t intere&s;t in every thing dear to the brethren. He that in common life can de&s;pi&s;e the mo&s;t whim&s;ical thoughts of a brother, will never enjoy his affections. A good brother mu&s;t learn to &s;ee without any contempt, the mo&s;t &s;trange opinions living in a good heart. A Lodge is not a place for de|bate, or controver&s;y. Political que&s;tions are unknown in it. Every thing belonging to a brother enjoys our charity.</P>
<P><PB REF="031799_0016_0FEF284B297AED50">
MASONS &s;hould determine the <HI>conver&s;ation</HI> of a Lodge. The conver&s;ation that &s;eems to have no higher aim than to diffu&s;e general plea&s;ure, and ends in no ill natured reflecti|ons, but leaves friends at parting in perfect good humour, tends more to make men love one another, do their duty in &s;ociety, and love their Creator, than any we can adopt in &s;uch a&s;&s;ociations. Mo&s;t of our duty lies in &s;ociety, and mo&s;t of our virtue in contribut|ing to make men happy in them&s;elves. A wi&s;e man will look around him, not to &s;ay an ill thing without danger, but to learn how to recommend the mo&s;t u&s;eful thoughts he can utter. He will endeavour to plea&s;e in the be&s;t manner with the lea&s;t offence.</P>
<P>AND for our common intere&s;t let me &s;ay, after Lodges have received their charters, and have been in&s;tructed, if they do not a&s;&s;ert an independence, they are too apt to enjoy it. They become too negligent of their <HI>repre&s;en|tation,</HI> and of their <HI>communications in the</HI> GRAND LODGE. Excellent members, con|fined to their lovely lodges, forget that we are a band of brethren, and owe each other the
<PB REF="031799_0017_0FEF28500EA9FB88">mo&s;t free communications. Every brother ought to a&s;pire after the honours of the&s;e or|derly vi&s;its; and, next to our own bu&s;ine&s;s, ought to be an enquiry into the la&s;t quarterly communications. A ma&s;on would then find that he belonged to a &s;ociety more exten&s;ive than of his own neighbourhood. He would thus have the progre&s;s of the order, in his own country at lea&s;t, if not through the world, before him. In his private plea&s;ures he would not forget the general pro&s;perity. We have our re&s;pective orbs; but we revolve around a common center. And from its glo|ry, we have life, health and fraternity.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould al&s;o be remembered, that <HI>the &s;trength of Lodges is in their members.</HI> While Lodges are open to the vi&s;its of Brethren, great care &s;hould be &s;hewn, that due honours are given to members of Lodges. Generous liberty does not permit a brother to make a free u&s;e of his privilege, while in no place he welcomes a regular &s;ummons. The Tem|ple is not fini&s;hed, and no brother cea&s;es en|tirely from labour, unle&s;s privileged by particu|lar &s;ervices. To be members, is to hold the ob|ligation,
<PB N="20" REF="031799_0018_0FEF285649B4D530">which is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the exi&s;tence of our order.</P>
<P>IN <HI>expences,</HI> that method will be mo&s;t hap|py, which keeps the funds, the &s;pecial cha|rities, the current charges, and the entertain|ments, mo&s;t di&s;tinct. The la&s;t ought to fall upon tho&s;e who enjoy them. They are, therefore, better out of the Lodge than in it, for <HI>moral,</HI> as well as <HI>economical</HI> rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>admi&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>members,</HI> regard ought to be paid to merit, in the kinde&s;t exempti|ons from expence when the per&s;ons of merit cannot well &s;upport it. Such men would bring a character with them, and e&s;tabli&s;h it in a Lodge. It would then be free from cen|&s;ure, and adorned with all the virtues of the be&s;t of men.</P>
<P>AND as we hold &s;acred the confidence of dome&s;tic life, our plea&s;ures &s;hould never in|croach upon the hours devoted to retirement, and to our homes.</P>
<P>IN qualifying our&s;elves to fill the Offices with &s;uch virtues, we ri&s;e in the public e&s;|teem,
<PB N="21" REF="031799_0019_0FEF287F0B4ACEE0">and enjoy the benevolent end of our in&s;titution. Our habits become as favourable to the be&s;t &s;ervices in our power towards our brethren, as our hearts become free for the enjoyment of our &s;ocial glee; and neither our intere&s;t in the world, nor our good habits &s;uf|fer from our lovely a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>LET us then cultivate the true temper of Free Ma&s;onry, and let us adorn the character with its commendable virtues. Then in hap|py time we may adorn a ma&s;ter's &s;tation, and we &s;hall always po&s;&s;e&s;s the merit, which would ju&s;tify the appointment.</P>
<P>BELIEVE me, when I &s;ay, that as I love the principles of the Order, and have &s;een their benefit, &s;o I &s;incerely de&s;ire to &s;ee the order re&s;pectable.</P>

<P>WHILE this day affords an opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing our united attachment to the grand principles of humanity, let it prove a new motive to &s;trengthen the endearing ligature which binds congenial hearts.&mdash;To my valued Brethren of WASHINGTON LODGE, the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion is replete with <HI>intere&s;ting, im|portant,</HI> and <HI>joyous</HI> circum&s;tances. It is the <HI>birth-day</HI> of their privileges; and they are now to receive the &s;anction of e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the &s;olemnity of con&s;ecration. Cheerfully do I do mingle my felicitations with theirs.</P>
<P>IT is truly plea&s;ing to &s;ee the&s;e Colonies of the friends of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> &s;pread|ing them&s;elves around. It is a renewed evi|dence of the acknowledged importance, and increa&s;ed reputation of our excellent &s;ociety.</P>

<P><HI>Right Wor&s;hipful</HI> MASTER, <HI>Re&s;pected</HI> OFFI|CERS, <HI>and beloved</HI> BRETHREN of WASHING|TON LODGE! with all the &s;incerity of frater|nal affection does my heart proffer you its be&s;t wi&s;hes. Nor need I extend the de&s;ires of cordial regard, for your united and individual pro&s;perity, farther than this comprehen&s;ive hope, that, as you have adopted the <HI>name</HI> of our MOST RENOWNED BROTHER for the re|commendatory title of your Lodge, you may adopt his <HI>virtues</HI> for the recommendatory or|nament of your lives!&mdash;May the Lodge now con&s;ecrated, be con&s;picuous for its clear <HI>light,</HI> and long honored in its enlarging &s;phere of <HI>u&s;efulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>glory!</HI></P>
<P>AND &s;urely the&s;e congratulations and wi&s;hes are reciprocated by every friend to the &s;ocial intere&s;ts and happine&s;s of mankind. E&s;pecially when they are daily more and more convinced, that the <HI>light</HI> in which we rejoice, is not the mimic blaze which glitters o'er the train of folly, but the &s;teady lu&s;tre reflected, from tho&s;e re&s;plendent luminaries of the Ma&s;onic hemi&s;phere, WISDOM, TRUTH, and VIRTUE.</P>

LET it be remembered, that on the firm ba&s;is of general <HI>Philanthropy</HI> are erected the pillars of our in&s;titution, modelled to a perfec|tion which no art can excel, no marble out|live. While we admire the noble &s;tructure of the edifice, we receive the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;atis|faction and in&s;truction in peru&s;ing tho&s;e hea|venly documents which compo&s;e its arcana. We are there taught the mo&s;t &s;olid truths, important and intere&s;ting to the welfare of mankind. Directed by the grand principles there delineated, we approach nearer the divine plan of the SOVEREIGN ARCHITECT; and becoming perfect ma&s;ons, are rendered wi&s;er and better members of &s;ociety. In the calm moments of reflection, when dive&s;ted of the impre&s;&s;ions of prejudice, the world will approve the principles which animate us; &s;ince it is their glory to call forth into action the mo&s;t benevolent and noble feelings of the heart. The &s;alutary in&s;titutes of our Craft are happily calculated to produce the greate&s;t comfort to individuals and to augment the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, by teaching us to be|come temperate, ju&s;t, benevolent and pious; and by directing the natural propen&s;ities of the human &s;oul, the love of plea&s;ure and the
<PB N="7" REF="031799_0025_0FEF2899C411F630">love of action, to their noble&s;t ends. Tho&s;e qualities of the mind, which are thus excited and exerci&s;ed, tend immediately to refine our feelings and dignify our natures. And over the &s;cenes both of retired and public life, their benign influence &s;heds a mild and plea&s;ing lu&s;tre. The combined effect is allow|edly conducive to the amelioration of man|ners, and the improvement of &s;ocial bli&s;s.</P>
<P>So long as our race &s;hall be &s;ubject to infir|mity and expo&s;ed to misfortune, <HI>friendly hu|manity</HI> will be deemed a virtue and a ble&s;&s;ing; and &s;o long as individuals can derive advan|tage or plea&s;ure from reciprocal intere&s;t and attachment, the credit of this fraternity mu&s;t increa&s;e, and Ma&s;onry continue to de&s;erve univer&s;al approbation.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time that the in&s;tructions and operations of the Lodge a&s;&s;i&s;t in giving to the intellectual and moral faculties the <HI>Wi&s;dom, Strength,</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI> which accompli&s;h their perfection; they indu&s;triou&s;ly <HI>contrive</HI> and generou&s;ly <HI>&s;upport</HI> tho&s;e ingenious di&s;coveries and u&s;eful arts which correct <HI>ta&s;te</HI> and em|belli&s;h <HI>life.</HI></P>

GREAT are our obligations to tho&s;e venera|ble characters in whom fir&s;t dawned the light of Ma&s;onry; the united and increa&s;ing radiance of which, diffu&s;ing it&s;elf over remote&s;t climes, has been continually di&s;pelling the noxious vapors of gloomy &s;uper&s;tition and the gathering clouds of threatening envy. And we rejoice in tho&s;e energetic exertions which have &s;ucce&s;sfully contributed to form a &s;ocie|ty, and bring into complete operation an e&s;tabli&s;hment, who&s;e only aim is that of unit|ing, in the &s;ame &s;oftened and virtuous affecti|ons, the whole human race.</P>
<P>LET no brea&s;t, then, harbor &s;entiments incompatible with the liberal principles on which our a&s;&s;ociation is founded: &s;ince it mu&s;t be perver&s;ene&s;s to deny its merited honors to a Society which has ri&s;en &s;uperior, in every age, to partiality and prejudice; and, by the te&s;timony of its effects, &s;ilenced objection and conciliated e&s;teem.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE flowers of fancy and the figures of eloquence would be vainly lavi&s;hed in its prai&s;e. Sufficiently attractive to your eyes is the unadorned portrait. The pencil of <HI>Truth</HI> has &s;ketched the outline, and given</P>

IN conclu&s;ion, my Brethren will permit me to ob&s;erve, that, as we a&s;pire to the prai&s;e of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> &s;o we pro|fe&s;s our&s;elves the admirers of BEAUTY, natu|ral as well as intellectual and moral.

We owe them a tribute of warme&s;t thanks for gracing our public a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>IT is to be regretted that in&s;titutions in general have excluded that lovely &s;ex from becoming members. We di&s;claim the idea of their being unequal to any important tru&s;t or inadequate to the be&s;t purpo&s;es of &s;ociety. Were they to mingle more inti|mately with <HI>&s;ocial,</HI> or more actively with <HI>political</HI> in&s;titutions, much might be expect|ed from their poli&s;hed talents and beautiful de&s;igns. If it be a&s;ked why they are not permitted to join with us, in extending the intere&s;ts of humanity, and in cultivating and improving the friendly virtues; we would reply, that, their charms and attractions, which &s;o decorate the &s;cenery of life, would become incompatible with the labors of the Lodge; that <HI>Love, powerful Love,</HI> might &s;o

In the important bu&s;ine&s;s of our retirement, the pre&s;ence of the Fair would &s;o intermingle a train of bu&s;y loves, as to bani&s;h every other &s;entiment; and make us inattentive to every care and forgetful of every duty which forms the object and the recommendation of our es|tabli&s;hment.&mdash;Admit, ye lovely partners of our hearts and hopes, our hone&s;t apology: and be a&s;&s;ured that the <HI>fidelity</HI> which is in&s;cribed upon the Ma&s;on's brea&s;t, will give certainty to the Lover's promi&s;e, and permanency to the Hu&s;band's affection; will render us all more worthy of your regards, and more auxi|liary to your happine&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>BROTHERS,</HI></P>
<P>RECOLLECT that a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the rules of our duty will ever &s;ecure us from cen&s;ure and reproach. While by our con|duct we give no latitude for malicious in&s;inu|ations, the purity of our intentions, what|ever the uncandid may think of them, will not fail to give to our own hearts a confidence which will &s;upport and cheer in every &s;cene, and brighten the evening &s;hades of mortal exi&s;tence.</P>
