<HEAD>An Appeal to the People of the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts State, again&s;t Arbitrary Power.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND COUNTRYMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Cau&s;e is now to be tried before you, which is of infinite and eternal importance to us all; and can I be rea&s;on|ably blamed for addre&s;&s;ing you upon it &s;ince I am pub|licly called to act for many thou&s;ands in the affair? The cau&s;e I refer to turns upon this point, viz. Whether TRUTH and EQUITY, or PARTIALITY and HYPOCRISY &s;hall con&s;titute the future government of this State? I am far from &s;uppo&s;ing that you would adopt the latter under the&s;e names, or when you viewed them in their true nature and effects. The divine law was violated by our fir&s;t mother, under a view of its being <HI>good</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> &s;o to do; and the empire of iniquity ever &s;ince has been carried on, by calling <HI>evil good, and good evil; by putting darkne&s;s for light, and light for darkne&s;s, bitter for &s;weet, and &s;weet for bitter.</HI> And the in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>I fear le&s;t by any means, as the &s;erpent beguiled Eve through his &s;ubtilty, &s;o your minds &s;hould be corrupted from the &s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t.</HI> And he earne&s;tly calls us to <HI>mark tho&s;e who cau&s;e divi&s;ions and offences, contrary to his doctrine,</HI> under <HI>good words and fair &s;peeches.</HI> 2 Cor. 11.3. Rom 16.17, 18. And the ca&s;e to be tried by you is, who this mark belongs to, and whether it &s;hall now be put upon the right per&s;ons or not?</P>
<P>One of the greate&s;t hi&s;torians of New England exerted all his art to fix it upon the fir&s;t bapti&s;ts therein.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Magnalia, book</HI> 7. <HI>p</HI> 9. <HI>Bapti&s;t hi&s;tory, p.</HI> 109.</NOTE> And the ruling party in this State, have now made a like attempt to fix it up|on me, and upon the communities I am connected with. And you are all called upon, to approve or di&s;approve of this at|tempt; and if you &s;uffer a wrong judgment to proceed, when you can prevent it, you cannot be guiltle&s;s therein. Upon
<PB N="3" REF="043766_0003_101D643F7524EB60">this great cau&s;e you are to judge according to law and evi|dence; and my bu&s;ine&s;s is to open the ca&s;e before you, as clear|ly as I can.</P>
<P>Now you are to note, that Chri&s;t him&s;elf came on purpo&s;e to make divi&s;ions upon earth; therefore it is not all divi&s;ions, but only &s;uch as are contrary to his doctrine, that are condem|ned. And a fir&s;t and capital article of his doctrine is that HE IS HEAD OVER ALL THINGS TO THE CHURCH; and that &s;he is <HI>complete in him,</HI> Eph 1.21, 22. Col. 2.10. And tho&s;e are to be marked as deceivers who do not thus hold THE HEAD. Col. 2.19&mdash;23. Another article in his doctrine is, that no man <HI>can &s;ee his kingdom,</HI> nor have right to any <HI>power</HI> therein without <HI>regeneration.</HI> John 1.12, 13 &amp; 3.3 And the fir&s;t man that offered <HI>money</HI> as a means of obtaining <HI>power</HI> therein, is <HI>marked</HI> with an eternal brand of infamy. Acts 8.19.23. A third article is, that the whole of our duty is included in love to GOD, and love to our neighbour. Mat. 7.12, &amp; 22. 37&mdash;40. A fourth is, that the civil magi&s;trate's power is li|mitted to the la&s;t of the&s;e; and that his &s;word is to puni&s;h none but &s;uch as <HI>work ill to their neighbours.</HI> Rom. 13.1&mdash;10. 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. A fifth is, that tho&s;e who receive in&s;truction and benefit from Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters, are required freely to com|municate, according to their ability, to their temporal &s;upport, as they will an&s;wer it to him in the great day. Luke 10.7&mdash;12. 1 Cor. 9.4&mdash;14. Gal. 6.6, 7. A &s;ixth is, that none &s;hould hear, nor give countenance, to any teachers who bring not Chri&s;t's doctrine, but pervert his go&s;pel, as they would avoid partaking in their guilt. Prov. 19.27. Mark 4.24. 2 John, 10, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">. The&s;e are plain points of law. The facts and evi|dence, that you are called to judge upon are as follow.</P>
<P>The doctrine that New-England was founded upon was, that
<Q>the merits of &s;aints might as well be mingled with the purity of Chri&s;t for the &s;aving of the church, as the laws of men with her laws, for the ruling and guiding of it.</Q> Which doctrine was violated fifteen years after, when the le|gal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> at Bo&s;ton determined to mix their laws with Chri&s;t's laws about wor&s;hip, and to compel every man in the colony to &s;wear allegiance to <HI>that</HI> power, or to be puni&s;hed at their di&s;|cretion. And for te&s;tifying again&s;t <HI>&s;uch power</HI> and <HI>&s;uch oaths,</HI> they bani&s;hed the fir&s;t bapti&s;t mini&s;ter in America out of their juri&s;diction
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bapti&s;t hi&s;tory, p</HI> 31, 62&mdash;70, 156, 157.</NOTE> And to prevent the like evils for the future, our churches &s;ent me to Philadelphia, when the fir&s;t congre&s;s was &s;itting, to improve the be&s;t means we could, to promote <HI>impar|tial liberty</HI> among our&s;elves, &s;eeing we were equally concerned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> again&s;t foreign invaders. This attempt was plainly encouraged by the 17th re&s;olve of the county of Suffolk, where|in
<PB N="4" REF="043766_0004_101D644102160AD8">they promi&s;ed to pay all due re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch mea&s;ures as the Congre&s;s &s;hould recommend, "for the re&s;tora|tion and e&s;tabli&s;hment of our ju&s;t rights, civil and <HI>religious."</HI> It was not then known here that they would refu&s;e to be judges of religious controver&s;ies. The&s;e re&s;olves I carried with me to that city, where a promi&s;e was obtained from our delegates in congre&s;s, that they would improve their influence toward dif|fu&s;ing the religious liberty that has long been enjoyed in Bo&s;|ton into the remote&s;t parts of this State. But this was &s;o far from being fulfilled, that &s;ome, if not all of tho&s;e gentlemen ac|cu&s;ed us in the convention la&s;t fall, of acting an unfriendly part towards our country, for making the attempt which pro|cured that promi&s;e. Therefore, in the Independent Chronicle of Dec. 2, I gave a narrative of the&s;e affairs, and challenged them to a fair hearing thereon. But in&s;tead of any &s;uch thing, that accu&s;ation is repeated in &s;aid paper of Feb. 10, to which other horrid ones are added, by one who &s;tiles him&s;elf a num|ber of the convention, without intending the public &s;hould know his name. And all this, my countrymen, is to per&s;uade you to &s;wallow down the third article, which, after a very hard &s;truggle, they have in&s;erted in the bill of rights, that they would lay as the foundation of our future government. Which article is pregnant with the following evil.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It a&s;&s;erts a right in the people of this State, to make and execute laws about the wor&s;hip of God; directly contrary to the truth, which a&s;&s;ures us that we have but ONE LAWGIVER in &s;uch affairs. I&s;ai. 33 22. James 4, 12</P>
<P N="2">2d. They who framed this article are &s;o far from holding THE HEAD of the church, and from allowing her to be <HI>com|pleat in him,</HI> that they do not name either Chri&s;t or his church in all their account of the wor&s;hip of God, and of the choice and &s;upport of religious teachers. So that <HI>good</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s</HI> are the fine names under which you are urged to receive in|&s;tructions, "in piety, religion and morality," without any regard either to our <HI>only Mediator,</HI> or to her who is pre&s;ented as a <HI>cha&s;te virgin to him.</HI> 2 Cor 11, 2.</P>
<P N="3">3d This article is &s;o <HI>partial,</HI> that it would empower the majority in every town and pari&s;h, to covenant for the re&s;t with religious mini&s;ters, and to compel every man therein to &s;upport the pari&s;h mini&s;ter, if the money paid was not required for o|thers. And no man could require it, nor mini&s;ter receive it, with a good con&s;cience, who believed this way to be unju&s;t and there are thou&s;ands in this State, of various denominations.</P>
<P N="4">4th If this article &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, our ca&s;e would be incomparably wor&s;e than it has ever yet been. For fir&s;t, our former laws about wor&s;hip proceeded entirely from the mi&s;|takes and errors of the legi&s;lators, and not at all from our char|ters:
<PB N="5" REF="043766_0005_101D6442AADFB158">but this article would make them an e&s;&s;ential part of our con&s;titution. Secondly, we had formerly a legal way of ap|peal from the unju&s;t acts and &s;entences of the ruling &s;ect here; which was a great re&s;traint upon them. But the plan they have now laid, is to have that re&s;traint entirely taken off. Thirdly, this plan is to empower legi&s;lators, who are elected by <HI>money</HI> qualifications, if they do but bear the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> name, (which the church of Rome does as well as others) to compel all to attend and &s;upport what they &s;hall call the wor&s;hip of God; and what a door this would open upon us you ought to con&s;ider. Fourthly, the advocates for this power, have alrea|dy threatened revenge upon us for oppo&s;ing it, if they can ever get it e&s;tabli&s;hed. And in the mean time they have exhibited a &s;pecimen thereof to the world. For a former legi&s;lator headed a mob the June before la&s;t, and violently broke up a peaceable meeting for divine wor&s;hip, only becau&s;e it was in a way different from the judgment of his party. And becau&s;e I publi&s;hed an account of it, he &s;aid in open town meeting. <Q>I know how I will get my recompence of him if ever I come acro&s;s him!</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Independent Chronicle of Dec.</HI> 3, 1778.</NOTE> Yet he was &s;o far from receiving any puni&s;h|ment for all this, that he has been employed in forming the plan of government that is now offered to you. Another mem|ber of the convention was &s;o much inflamed by the forenamed accu&s;ations again&s;t us la&s;t fall, that he went home and procured the impri&s;onment of two of my brethren, on the very day that I an&s;wered tho&s;e accu&s;ations. And two more of my hearers were fined for refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;eizing the bodies of their friends, for a tax to a mini&s;ter they had di&s;&s;ented from and had declared they could not in con&s;cience &s;upport. And they have &s;ince been taxed to him again, and are daily expo&s;ed to impri&s;onment therefor. And our oppre&s;&s;ors in their publica|tions of Feb. 10. have accu&s;ed my brethren in the convention of being &s;uch mon&s;ters as "even to rake open the a&s;hes of the dead."</P>
<P>They &s;ay, <Q>No man would betake him&s;elf to declaiming and reviling, who had any &s;olid arguments to &s;upport his cau&s;e.</Q> I readily grant that &s;uch a practice indicates a bad temper, or a bad cau&s;e, or both. So far we are agreed But the di&s;pute is about which party have di&s;covered this black mark. In this publication they have <HI>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ed up</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">he German Anababti&s;ts whom they repre&s;ent as <Q>pleading con&s;cience for lying with each other's wives, and for murdering their peaceable neighbours.</Q> To whom they add. <Q>the cove|tous Phari&s;ees&mdash;Mahomet and the Je&s;uits;</Q> and the writer then &s;ays, <Q>the above account appears to me to contain a <HI>full</HI> an&s;wer to what Mr. Backus has publi&s;hed,</Q> excepting what concerns the particular gentlemen I named.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="043766_0006_101D64444CFB0750">
Here therefore, my dear countrymen, you have a very plain ca&s;e to judge upon. Our opponents call that <HI>good</HI> which we call <HI>evil.</HI> And the great judge of all &s;ays. <HI>Every one that doeth evil, hateth the light&mdash;but be that doth truth cometh to the light.</HI> John 3.20, 21. And you are called to judge betwixt us upon this great point. Each of us profe&s;s to plead for the cau&s;e of truth and equity, as it concerns your welfare as well as ours; and if you &s;hould give a wrong judgment upon it, none can &s;ay how great and pernicious the effects will be to us all, and to all &s;ucceeding generations, even till time &s;hall be no more; yea, to all eternity. Never was there &s;o fair an opportunity offered to any people &s;ince the ri&s;e of antichri&s;t, as you now have, to a&s;&s;ert your own rights, and to ca&s;t off tyranny. One charac|ter of tho&s;e who have <HI>a form</HI> but deny <HI>the power of godline&s;s.</HI> is that they are <HI>fal&s;e-accu&s;ers.</HI> Another is, that they are <HI>ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI> 2 Tim 3.1&mdash;7. And &s;ince it is certain that chri&s;tianity was founded upon <HI>the truth,</HI> and that the <HI>power of it</HI> conquered the Roman empire; do they not deny the power of it, who hold that it would &s;oon be lo&s;t from among us, if <HI>force</HI> was not u&s;ed to &s;upport it? I concur with them that religion has been the the life of New England. But I am &s;o far from thinking that human laws about religious wor&s;hip have been our life that I know they have been mo&s;t deadly things to us; &amp; that if the power of godline&s;s had not been above them &amp; had not prevailed again&s;t them we &s;hould all have been ruined long ago <HI>Plagues from God</HI> ever have followed, and ever will follow, tho&s;e who <HI>add</HI> to his laws about wor&s;hip Rev. 22 18. This was the practi&s;e and the portion of the Phari&s;ees, Mahomet, the Je&s;uits, and the mad men of Mun&s;ter; and can you be &s;o much de|ceived, as to continue that practice among us, becau&s;e the advo|cates for it, ca&s;t tho&s;e hateful names upon tho&s;e who oppo&s;e it! They do not come &s;o <HI>near to the light</HI> as the Phari&s;ees did; for when they taught God's fear by the <HI>precepts of men,</HI> they made a man an <HI>offender for a word.</HI> I&s;ai 29.13, 21. Mat. 15, 9; but our <HI>accu&s;ers</HI> have not done &s;o much as this.</P>
<P>Since I was fir&s;t called to act as agent for the Bapti&s;ts in this State, we have publi&s;hed four books, be&s;ides a number of pa|pers, again&s;t the u&s;e of &s;ecular force in religious affairs, which are now to be had in Bo&s;ton; yet, when in behalf of our church|es, I challenged our accu&s;ers in the convention, to a fair and open hearing; they have been &s;o far from it, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the co|vetous Phari&s;ees, Mahomet the Je&s;uits, and the German Ana|bapti&s;ts, upon us: and have added thereto an enormity that but few tyrants were ever guilty of. And all this without pro|ducing &s;o much as a &s;ingle <HI>word</HI> from all our writings to prove their charges again&s;t us. And in Mr. Gill's paper of March <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="7" REF="043766_0007_101D55751C366598">they call tho&s;e who oppo&s;e &s;aid article, <Q>a certain junto, com|po&s;ed of di&s;gui&s;ed tories, Briti&s;h emi&s;aries, pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">e and li|centions dei&s;ts, avaricious worldlings, di&s;affected &s;ectaries, and furious blind bigots.</Q> And you mu&s;t remember that they tell you plainly, that if they could have found any better arguments than the&s;e to &s;upport their cau&s;e, they would glad|ly have u&s;ed them.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of raking open the a&s;hes of the dead, we earne&s;tly re|que&s;ted our countrymen &s;even years ago, to bury &s;ome of their <HI>bones</HI> which appeared above ground.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal to the public, page</HI> 01.</NOTE> This our opponents were &s;o far from con&s;enting to, that they dragged a <HI>carca&s;e</HI> in|to the convention, to <HI>defile</HI> the wor&s;hip of GOD with. Ezekiel 43, 7&mdash;9. Upon which one of my brethren turned the cover|ing a little off from it; which is what they mean by their bit|ter exclamation. That is, they denied that their fathers ever <HI>per&s;ecuted</HI> any in this country; and he recited a few acts of their courts to prove that they did. The &s;entence of Solo|mon may give light in this ca&s;e. 1 Kings. 3.27. For our op|ponents are &s;o much for <HI>dividing the living child,</HI> that they would have religious teachers &s;ettled and &s;upported <HI>in the name of this State,</HI> who &s;hould admini&s;ter ordinances <HI>in the name of Chri&s;t.</HI> But tho&s;e women never thought of di&s;puting about which was the living child, and which not, as our ad|ver&s;aries do. For after the head of their form was cut clear off, they contend for power to put another <HI>head</HI> to it, and for the people to <HI>give life</HI> to &s;uch a mon&s;ter; as being <HI>e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to the good of the State. Rev. 13.15&mdash;18. The <HI>image</HI> there &s;poken of is undoubtedly <HI>a form</HI> of godline&s;s, in|vented and &s;upported by the <HI>power of man.</HI> In Luther's time it received a great <HI>wound</HI> by the <HI>&s;word of truth,</HI> which <HI>&s;tate-policy</HI> has &s;ince healed. But now when its <HI>head</HI> has been out clean off, our accu&s;ers are in earne&s;t to have the people put another head thereon, &s;o that the teachers who were &s;ettled in the name of King George, might be &s;upported by a name that then had no exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>All this nor&s;e proceeds from no better cau&s;e than our in&s;i&s;t|ing upon impartiality in our future government. We lately proved, that the greate&s;t mini&s;ter in Bo&s;ton, eighty years ago, who was then pre&s;ident of Harvard-College, called the practice we oppo&s;e SIMONY and ROBBERY.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Di&s;cour&s;e on policy and hone&s;ty, page</HI> 6.</NOTE> And the &s;pecial act which was then made in favour of this town, &s;hews that the legi&s;lators meant to <HI>abridge</HI> the country of the liberty Bo&s;ton would not part with. And I challenge all our opponents to prove if they can, that we have ever de&s;ired any other religious liberty, than
<PB N="8" REF="043766_0008_101D644D4E06D5E8" MS="y">to have this partiality intirely removed.
