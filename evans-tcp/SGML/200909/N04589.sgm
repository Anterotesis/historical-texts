<P>Prai&s;e ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new Song, and his Prai&s;e in the Con|gregation of Saints.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Book of <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> my Brethren, may be call'd the Summary of both Te&s;taments, there is in it &s;o much of God and his Law, as well as of Chri&s;t and his Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The Word <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> tho' it primarily &s;ig|nifies <HI>Prai&s;es,</HI> is doubtle&s;s of larger Extent, and intends all Compo&s;itions of Meeter that are fit to be &s;ung, whether of Hi&s;tory or Doctrine, of Prayer or Prai&s;e, becau&s;e many of them are really &s;uch; and hence we are directed not only to prai&s;e God, but <HI>to teach one another in P&s;alms, Hymns and &s;piritual Songs.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> is undoubt|edly the third Per&s;on of the adorable Trinity, they contain <HI>the Words which the

Holy Gho&s;t teacheth,</HI> and therefore are better fitted for the u&s;e of the Church, in every Age to the utmo&s;t period of Time, than any meer human Compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>The <HI>Penman</HI> of them, for the mo&s;t part, was <HI>David</HI> the Son of <HI>Je&s;&s;e,</HI> who is there|fore called the <HI>Sweet Singer of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scope</HI> of them, is principally to in|flame our <HI>Love</HI> to, and excite our <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> in the ble&s;&s;ed God, who is our Creator, Re|deemer and Benefactor; and thus to en|duce us to univer&s;al <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> in Practice.</P>
<P>But more particularly, the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>P&s;alm</HI> from which our Text is taken, was probably &s;ome <HI>Victory</HI> which <HI>I&s;rael</HI> ob|tained over their Enemies. Some con|jecture that it was pen'd when <HI>David</HI> had taken the &s;trong Hold of <HI>Zyon,</HI> and &s;ettled his Government there, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, &s;ayeth <HI>Muis,</HI> the latter part of the &s;econd Ver&s;e plainly &s;ignifies.

God and rejoice in him. <HI>Prai&s;e ye the Lord,</HI> i. e. Exalt and glorify him for all his Mercies. <HI>Sing unto the Lord a new Song,</HI> i. e, let your grateful Sentiments break forth into vocal Melody, and either compo&s;e a new Hymn of Prai&s;e upon e|very &s;pecial Occa&s;ion, or &s;ing with new and rai&s;ed Affections, which makes the Song new to us, tho' we have been ac|cu&s;tomed to u&s;e it before. <HI>And his Prai&s;e in the Congregation of Saints,</HI> i. e. Let not your thankful Sen&s;e of Mercies re|ceiv'd, be confin'd to your own Bo&s;oms or Retirements, but expre&s;s it openly to the Honour of the Giver, in the mo&s;t publick and &s;olemn A&s;&s;emblies, as tho&s;e that are neither afraid or a&s;ham'd of doing your Duty, and as de&s;irous to excite others con|currence in it: The greater the Number is that joins in this &s;acred grateful Harmo|ny, the more it re&s;embles the Choirs above, who&s;e continual Bu&s;ine&s;s and Happine&s;s it is, to celebrate the Divine Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Now the Words of our Text, con&s;idered in their Connection, may be re&s;olv'd into this Propo&s;ition, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005700_0006_1026C6883B5F66E0"><HI>That Prai&s;ing God for Mercies receiv'd is an important Duty.</HI></P>

</LIST></P>
<P>And then proceed to the <HI>Improvement.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. As to the <HI>Mercies</HI> we &s;hould <HI>prai&s;e God for,</HI> I may &s;ay, that every Benefit he vouch&s;afes, de&s;erves our grateful Acknow|ledgments, whether it be temporal or &s;pi|ritual, per&s;onal or publick, the lea&s;t Mercy we receive may ju&s;tly be counted great in re&s;pect of us, who have by Sin forfeited a Right to all, and therefore merit none; and it is likewi&s;e <HI>the Will of God, that in every Thing we &s;hould give Thanks;</HI> No Mercy that a gracious God vouch&s;afes, &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed over with a Stupid in|ob&s;ervant Neglect: And truly it is a la|mentable and awful Sign of the Degene|racy of human Nature, that the Common|ne&s;s

and long Continuance of Benefits, which &s;hould enhance our E&s;teem of them, does often le&s;&s;en it.</P>
<P>But methinks tho&s;e Benefits which tend to promote the publick Intere&s;t, and &s;afety of the Community to which we belong, and in which our Per&s;ons and Properties, our civil and religious Liberties are em|bark'd, claim our peculiar Acknowledg|ments; for &s;urely &s;o much the more ex|ten&s;ive any Good is, &s;o much the more valuable it is. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bonum quo Communius, eo Melius.</NOTE> Private Intere&s;t is no far|ther excellent, than as it is con&s;i&s;tent with, and conducive to the Good of the Publick, which we are born to promote, and there|fore &s;hould be &s;en&s;ibly affected, when this noble End is in any Degree attained, which it certainly is, by notable Victories over the Enemies of our Religion and Liberties; and the more the Hand of God appears in bringing them to pa&s;s, the &s;tronger En|gagements we are under to prai&s;e him; this the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ignifies in the following emphatical Lines; <HI>O &s;ing unto the Lord a

And prai&s;e JEHOVAH for it with joyful Lips! This leads me to the</P>
<P N="2">II. Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, which was to &s;hew, <HI>what is</HI> &s;uppos'd <HI>by, and</HI> imply'd <HI>in prai&s;ing God for Mercies receiv'd.</HI></P>
<P>Now I think that this Duty <HI>&s;uppo&s;es,</HI> 1&s;t. A <HI>Love</HI> to God's Maje&s;ty. In proporti|on to the Degree of this &s;hall we be en|clin'd to prai&s;e him. Prai&s;e is indeed the proper Fruit of Love; love tunes the Heart to Gratitude, and makes the Lips move in Prai&s;e; while Love in&s;pires the Soul with

grateful Sentiments, <HI>the Tongue is as the Pen of a ready Writer, in &s;peaking the Ho|nours of the King.</HI> Until Men be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of this noble Grace of Love, tran&s;cendent Love to God, they do not prai&s;e him a|right for Mercies receiv'd; they are en|clin'd either to pa&s;s them by with entire Neglect, or return but a complimental Gratitude, which that God who is a Spirit does not regard: It is not the Strength of the Voice, or Harmony of Sounds, but the Fervour of our Love that makes Melody in the Ears of God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Non vox &s;ed Votum, non mu&s;ica chordula, &s;ed cor; non cla|mans &s;ed am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, cantat in aure Dei.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Prai&s;ing God for Mercies received, <HI>&s;uppo&s;es,</HI> a firm <HI>Per&s;wa&s;ion</HI> of his <HI>providen|tial Government</HI> over all Events. If we imagine that Things come at Random and by Chance, how &s;hall we be enduc'd to prai&s;e God for what we think does not happen by his Interpo&s;al and Direction? It is therefore of the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity, that our Minds be fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Be|lief of this Fundamental Article, that the Great God hath an ab&s;olute, eternal and

univer&s;al Empire; and that by his Sove|reign and &s;uperintending Providence, he conducts all the Works of his Hands, to the End de&s;ign'd for them at their For|mation, which without this they never could attain. No Effect of the divine Power, is beneath the Cognizance and Care of his Providence: That <HI>Pagan</HI> Pro|verb, <Q>That the gods in&s;pected great Affairs, but neglected &s;mall,</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dei magna Curan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, parva negligunt.</NOTE> is un|worthy of the Chri&s;tian Character! What but divine Providence crowns (at times) the mo&s;t improbable Enterprizes with &s;urprizing Succe&s;s, and renders the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Schemes abortive! and hence we are truly told in the &s;acred Volumn, that <HI>the Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the &s;trong,</HI> and that <HI>Promotion comes neither from the Ea&s;t, nor We&s;t, nor South, but that God rai&s;es up one and pulls down another.</HI> No doubt the mo&s;t probable Mea&s;ures are ge|nerally &s;ucceeded, and this &s;hould enduce us to u&s;e them, and to give due honour to the In&s;truments that God is plea&s;ed to

improve in the Conveyance of any Benefit, But &s;eeing they are not always pro&s;perous, and that even when they are, it is God who directs to them and gives the Succe&s;s; therefore divine Sovereignty and Mercy &s;hould be &s;upreamly acknowledged, and celebrated as the Fountain of all our Be|nefits!

<P>But on the contrary, <HI>Ingratitude</HI> is the Sin of Sins, it rebels again&s;t God's commanding Authority, is di&s;ingenuous to his Love, and expo&s;es us to his fearful Di&s;plea&s;ure; it is like a froward Child's attempting to beat his Mo|ther's Brea&s;ts, and kick his Father's Bowels.</P>
<P>You are doubtle&s;s aware, my Brethren, that the Occa&s;ion of this Di&s;cour&s;e, is the late me|morable <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> with which it has pleas'd in|dulgent Heaven to crown his Maje&s;ty's Arms, in the late Expedition again&s;t the City and Fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>Louisburgh</HI> on <HI>Cape Breton,</HI> on the Account of which this Town was &s;o lately illuminated, and &s;o ju&s;tly and generally expre&s;&s;ed a joyful Sen&s;e of the Benefit.</P>
<P>I need not inform you Sirs, of how great Im|portance this Conque&s;t is to all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Do|minions in general, and to this <HI>Engli&s;h Main</HI> in particular; hereby our Commerce is both protected and encreas'd, and a Barrier fix'd which may be of great Service to prevent the Inroads of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> upon the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Inhabitants of this Continent.</P>
<P>But that which peculiarly enhances the Value of this Mercy is, that it gives &s;ome

check to the ambitious De&s;igns and cruel Intrigues of a proud and potent Prince, who unweariedly labours to rob us of our civil and religious Liberties, and bring us into the mo&s;t wretched Va&s;&s;alage to arbi|trary Power and Church Tyranny. A Prince who di&s;turbs all <HI>Europe</HI> by his Coun|cils and Arms, in order to erect a univer|&s;al Monarchy upon the Ruins of other King|doms and States. How admirable there|fore is the Mercy of God in giving into our Hands this &s;trong Hold of the Enemy of our Religion and Liberties!</P>
<P>What Cau&s;e have we, dear Sirs! to prai&s;e a gracious God, for his propitious Smiles on this <HI>Expedition?</HI> e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider how remarkably divine Pro|vidence has appear'd in it, by a Train of &s;urprizing Incidents!</P>
<P>That a City &s;o well fortify'd by Nature and Art as <HI>Louisburgh,</HI> a City almo&s;t impregna|ble, &s;hou'd be &s;o &s;oon reduc'd by &s;o &s;mall and unexperienced an Army, and that with &s;o little Effu&s;ion of Blood, is truly amazing!</P>
<P>Altho' the prudent Council's of the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Government, in forming the Plan of the Expedition, and the di&s;creet Conduct

and intrepid Courage of their Forces, in the Pro&s;ecution of it, in Conjunction with the Naval Armament, under the Command and Direction of <HI>brave</HI> Commodore WAR|REN, are much to be commended. Yet &s;urely it was the ble&s;&s;ed God, my Brethren&punc; that directed them to it, and &s;pirited them for it: 'Twas He that conducted them in it, and gave the Succe&s;s: 'Twas He that enclin'd our gracious <HI>Sovereign</HI> to favour the prudent Project: 'Twas He who gave &s;uch a Scene of uncommon, but agreeable Weather, as &s;erv'd to accelerate the De&s;ign: 'Twas He who pre&s;erv'd <HI>Health</HI> in the Camp and in the Fleet, and made their <HI>Councils harmonious:</HI> 'Twas He that prefac'd this memorable Event by the Capture of the <HI>Vi|gilant:</HI>&mdash;And therefore to him let us a&s;cribe the Glory; <HI>Who&s;e right Hand and holy Arm hath given us the Victory, and made us tread upon the high Places of our Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>Surely the &s;ame &s;uperintending <HI>Providence,</HI> that directed the Arrow to pierce between the Joynts of <HI>Ahab's Harnace,</HI> guided the <HI>Bombs</HI> to the Annoyance of the <HI>I&s;land-Battery.</HI></P>
<P>Neither &s;hould the &s;ea&s;onable <HI>Juncture</HI> of the <HI>Surrender,</HI> be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ordid

Silence and &s;tupid Neglect, when it is con|&s;idered, that the very Day after it, news were brought to our Army of <HI>Two Thou&s;and five Hundred French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> within &s;even Miles of them, de&s;ign'd for the Relief of <HI>Louis|burgh;</HI> which if they had heard of before the Surrender, would probably have encouraged them to a vigorous and ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I may add my Brethren, that this merciful Succe&s;s has been given in an&s;wer to <HI>Prayer,</HI> which &s;hould excite the more our Love and Prai&s;e; <HI>I love the Lord,</HI> &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>becau&s;e he hath heard my Supplication, becau&s;e he hath enclin'd his Ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</HI> The Army that Almighty God chiefly u&s;ed in bringing to pa&s;s this great Event, were a pray|ing Army; of which, as it is reported, <HI>General</HI> PEPPEREL gave them a noble Example!</P>
<P>Sirs, when we con&s;ider how much we have by Sin abus'd the pa&s;t Mercies that a gracious God has vouch&s;af'd upon us, we have Rea&s;on to be a&s;toni&s;h'd at this additi|onal immerited and important Benefit! <HI>therefore, prai&s;e ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new Song, and his Prai&s;e in the Congregation of Saints. Let</HI> I&s;rael <HI>re|joice

<P>GOD's People are e&s;pecially call'd upon to prai&s;e their God, with all proper Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of E&s;teem and Honour, both in their private Retirements and publick A&s;|&s;emblies, from a Principle of Love to and Joy in him, becau&s;e of his Dominion over them, delight in them, and marvelous Do|ings for them, as well as gracious De&s;igns to|wards them in after Time.
