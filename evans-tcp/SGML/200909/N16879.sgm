<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE favorable reception this Work has met with, claims the Author's mo&s;t grateful acknowledg|ments. A large edition having run off in a few months, and the &s;ale appearing to be &s;till unabated, a new im|pre&s;&s;ion is become nece&s;&s;ary. On this occa&s;ion was he to conceal his feelings, and pa&s;s over in &s;ilence, a di&s;|tinction &s;o beneficial and flattering, he would ju&s;tly in|cur the imputation of ingratitude. That he might not do this, he takes the opportunity, which now pre&s;ents it&s;elf, of conveying to the Public (though in terms ina|dequate to the warm emotions of his heart) the &s;en&s;e he entertains of their favor; and thus tran&s;mits to them his thanks.</P>
<P>In this new edition, care has been taken to rectify tho&s;e errors which have unavoidably proceeded from the hurry of the pre&s;s, and likewi&s;e any incorrectne&s;s in the language that has found its way into it.</P>
<P>The credibility of &s;ome of the incidents related in the following pages, and &s;ome of the &s;tories introduced therein, having been que&s;tioned, particularly the prog|no&s;tication of the Indian prie&s;t on the banks of Lake Superior, and the &s;tory of the Indian and his rattle &s;nake, the author thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to avail him&s;elf of the &s;ame opportunity, to endeavor to eradicate any im|pre&s;&s;ions that might have been made on the minds of his readers, by the apparent improbability of the&s;e relations.</P>
<P>As to the former, he has related it ju&s;t as it happened. Being an eye-witne&s;s to the whole tran&s;action (and, he flatters him&s;elf, at the time, free from every trace of &s;cepti|cal o&s;tinacy or enthu&s;ia&s;tic credulity) he was con&s;equently able to de&s;cribe every circum&s;tance minutely and imparti|ally.
<PB N="vi" REF="021728_0005_0FB537A1D9726398">
This he has done; but without endeavoring to ac|count for the means by which it was accompli&s;hed. Whe|ther the prediction was the re&s;ult of prior ob&s;ervations, from which certain con&s;equences were expected to fol|low by the &s;agacious prie&s;t, and the completion of it merely accidental; or whether he was really endowed with &s;upernatural powers, the narrator left to the judg|ment of his readers; who&s;e conclu&s;ions, he &s;uppo&s;es, va|ried according as the mental faculties of each were di&s;|po&s;ed to admit or reject facts that cannot be accounted for by natural cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of the rattle &s;nake was related to him by a French gentleman of undoubted veracity; and were the readers of this work as thoroughly acquainted with the &s;agacity, and in&s;tinctive proceedings of that animal, as he is, they would be as well a&s;&s;ured of the truth of it. It is well known that tho&s;e &s;nakes which have &s;urvived through the &s;ummer the accidents reptiles are liable to, periodical|ly retire to the woods, at the approach of winter; where each (as curious ob&s;ervers have remarked) takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cavity it had occupied the preceding year. As &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on is propitious, enlivened by the invigorating rays of the &s;un, they leave the&s;e retreats, and make their way to the &s;ame &s;pot, though ever &s;o di&s;tant, on which they before had found &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the means of pro|pagating their &s;pecies. Does it then require any extraor|dinary exertions of the mind to believe, that one of the&s;e regular creatures, after having been kindly treated by its ma&s;ter, &s;hould return to the box, in which it had u&s;ually been &s;upplied with food, and had met with a comfortable abode, and that nearly about the time the Indian, from former experiments, was able to gue&s;s at? It certainly does not; nor will the liberal and ingenuous doubt the truth of a &s;tory &s;o well authenticated, becau&s;e the circum|&s;tances appear extraordinary in a country where the &s;ub|ject of it is &s;carcely known.</P>
<P>The&s;e explanations the author hopes will &s;uffice to con|vince his readers, that he has not, as travellers are &s;ome|times &s;uppo&s;ed to do, amu&s;ed them with improbable tales, or wi&s;hed to acquire importance by making his adven|tures favor of the marvellous.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>NO &s;ooner was the late War with France con|cluded, and Peace e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Treaty of Ver&s;ailles in the Year 1763, than I began to con&s;ider (having rendered my country &s;ome &s;ervices du|ring the war) how I might continue &s;till &s;erviceable, and contribute, as much as lay in my power, to make that va&s;t acqui&s;ition of territory, gained by Great-Bri|tain, in North-America, advantageous to it. It appear|ed to me indi&s;pen&s;ably needful, that Government &s;hould be acquainted, in the fir&s;t place, with the true &s;tate of the dominions they were now become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. To this purpo&s;e, I determined, as the next proof of my zeal, to explore the mo&s;t unknown parts of them, and to &s;pare no trouble or expence in acquiring a know|ledge that promi&s;ed to be &s;o u&s;eful to my countrymen. I knew that many ob&s;tructions would ari&s;e to my &s;cheme from the want of good Maps and Charts; for the French, whil&s;t they retained their power in North-America, had taken every artful method to keep all other nations, particularly the Engli&s;h, in ignorance of the concerns of the interior parts of it: and to ac|compli&s;h this de&s;ign with the greater certainty, they had publi&s;hed inaccurate maps and fal&s;e accounts; calling the different nations of the Indians by nicknames they had given them, and not by tho&s;e really appertaining to them. Whether the intention of the French in doing this, was to prevent the&s;e nations from being di&s;covered and traded with, or to conceal their di&s;cour&s;e, when they talked to each other of the Indian concerns, in their pre&s;ence, I will not determine; but what&s;oever was the cau&s;e from which it aro&s;e, it tended to mi&s;lead.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="021728_0017_0FB537B9D85BBF90">As a proof that the Engli&s;h had been greatly deceiv|ed by the&s;e accounts, and that their knowledge rela|tive to Canada had u&s;ually been very confined;&mdash;before the conque&s;t of Crown-Point in 1759, it had been e&s;teem|ed an impregnable fortre&s;s; but no &s;ooner was it taken, than we were convinced that it had acquired its greate&s;t &s;ecurity from fal&s;e reports, given out by its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and might have been battered down with a few four pounders. Even its &s;ituation, which was repre&s;ented to be &s;o very advantageous, was found to owe its advan|tages to the &s;ame &s;ource. It cannot be denied but that &s;ome maps of the&s;e countries have been publi&s;hed by the French with an appearance of accuracy; but the&s;e are of &s;o &s;mall a &s;ize, and drawn on &s;o minute a &s;cale, that they are nearly inexplicable. The &s;ources of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, I can a&s;&s;ert from my own experience, are greatly mi&s;placed; for when I had explored them, and compared their &s;ituation with the French Charts, I found them very erroneou&s;ly repre&s;ented, and am &s;atis|fied that the&s;e were only copied from the rude &s;ketch|es of the Indians.</P>
<P>Even &s;o lately as their evacuation of Canada, they continued their &s;chemes to deceive; leaving no traces by which any knowledge might accrue to their conquerors; for though they were well acquainted with all the Lakes, particularly with Lake Superior, having con|&s;tantly a ve&s;&s;el of con&s;iderable burthen thereon, yet their plans of them are very incorrect. I di&s;covered many errors in the de&s;criptions given therein of its i&s;lands and bays, during a progre&s;s of eleven hundred miles that I coa&s;ted it in canoes. They likewi&s;e, on giving up the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, took care to leave the places they had occupied, in the &s;ame uncultivated &s;tate they had found them; at the &s;ame time de&s;troying all their naval force. I ob&s;erved my&s;elf part of the hulk of a very large ve&s;&s;el, burnt to the water's edge, ju&s;t at the open|ing from the Straits of St. Marie's into the Lake.</P>
<P>The&s;e difficulties, however, were not &s;ufficient to de|ter me from the undertaking, and I made preparations for &s;etting out. What I chiefly had in view, after gain|ing a knowledge of the manners, cu&s;toms, languages,
<PB N="iii" REF="021728_0018_0FB537BB5AC4E7C0">
&s;oil, and natural productions of the different nations that inhabit the back of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, was to a&s;certain the breadth of that va&s;t continent, which extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, in its broade&s;t part be|tween 43 and 46 degrees northern latitude. Had I been able to accompli&s;h this, I intended to have pro|po&s;ed to government to e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;t in &s;ome of tho&s;e parts about the Straits of Annian, which having been fir&s;t di&s;covered by Sir Francis Drake, of cour&s;e belong to the Engli&s;h. This I am convinced would greatly fa|cilitate the di&s;covery of a Northwe&s;t Pa&s;&s;age, or a com|munication between Hud&s;on's Bay and the Pacific Ocean. An event &s;o de&s;irable, and which has been &s;o often &s;ought for, but without &s;ucce&s;s. Be&s;ides this im|portant end, a &s;ettlement on that extremity of America would an&s;wer many good purpo&s;es, and repay every ex|pence the e&s;tabli&s;hment of it might occa&s;ion. For it would not only di&s;clo&s;e new &s;ources of trade, and pro|mote many u&s;eful di&s;coveries, but would open a pa&s;&s;age for conveying intelligence to China, and the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t Indies, with greater expedition than a tedious voyage by the Cape of Good Hope, or the Straits of Magellan will allow of.</P>
<P>How far the advantages ari&s;ing from &s;uch an enter|prize may extend, can only be a&s;certained by the favor|able concurrence of future events. But that the com|pletion of the &s;cheme, I have had the honor of fir&s;t planning and attempting, will &s;ome time or other be effected, I make no doubt. From the unhappy divi&s;i|ons that at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;t between Great-Britain and America, it will probably be &s;ome years before the at|tempt is repeated; but whenever it is, and the executi|on of it carried on with propriety, tho&s;e who are &s;o fortunate as to &s;ucced, will reap, exclu&s;ive of the nation|al advantages that mu&s;t en&s;ue, emoluments beyond their mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. And whil&s;t their &s;pirits are elated by their &s;ucce&s;s, perhaps they may be&s;tow &s;ome commendations and ble&s;&s;ings on the per&s;on who fir&s;t pointed out to them the way. The&s;e, though but a &s;hadowy recompence for all my toil, I &s;hall receive with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="021728_0019_0FB537C13310D870">To what power or authority this new world will become dependent, after it has ari&s;en from its pre&s;ent un|cultivated &s;tate, time alone can di&s;cover. But as the &s;eat of Empire from time immemorial has been gradually progre&s;&s;ive towards the We&s;t, there is no doubt but that at &s;ome future period, mighty kingdoms will emerge from the&s;e wilderne&s;&s;es, and &s;tately palaces and &s;olemn temples, with gilded &s;pires reaching the &s;kies, &s;upplant the Indian huts, who&s;e only decorations are the barbarous trophies of their vanqui&s;hed enemies.</P>
<P>As &s;ome of the preceding pa&s;&s;ages have already in|formed the reader that the plan I had laid down for penetrating to the Pacific Ocean, proved abortive, it is nece&s;&s;ary to add, that this proceeded not from its im|practicability (for the further I went the more con|vinced I was that it could certainly be accompli&s;hed) but from unfore&s;een di&s;appointments. However, I pro|ceeded &s;o far, that I was able to make &s;uch di&s;coveries as will be u&s;eful in any future attempt, and prove a good foundation for &s;ome more fortunate &s;ucce&s;&s;or to build upon. The&s;e I &s;hall now lay before the public in the following pages; and am &s;atisfied that the greate&s;t part of them have never been publi&s;hed by any per&s;on that has hitherto treated of the interior nations of the Indians; particularly, the account I give of the Nau|dowe&s;&s;ies, and the &s;ituation of the heads of the four great rivers that take their ri&s;e within a few leagues of each other, nearly about the center of this great con|tinent; viz. The River Bourbon, which empties it&s;elf into Hud&s;on's Bay; the waters of Saint Lawrence; the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and the River Oregon, or the River of the We&s;t, that falls into the Pacific Ocean, at the Straits of Annian.</P>
<P>The impediments that occa&s;ioned my returning, be|fore I had accompli&s;hed my purpo&s;es, were the&s;e. On my arrival at Michillimackinac, the remote&s;t Engli&s;h po&s;t, in September 1766, I applied to Mr. Rogers, who was then governor of it, to furni&s;h me with a proper a&s;|&s;ortment of goods, as pre&s;ents for the Indians who in|habit the track I intended to pur&s;ue. He did this only in part; but promi&s;ed to &s;upply me with &s;uch as were
<PB N="v" REF="021728_0020_0FB537C6782B97C8">
nece&s;&s;ary, when I reached the Falls of Saint Anthony. afterwards learned that the governor fulfilled his pro|mi&s;e in ordering the goods to be delivered to me; but tho&s;e to who&s;e care he intru&s;ted them, in&s;tead of con|forming to his orders, di&s;po&s;ed of them el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed in my expectations from this quarter, I I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to return to La Prairi&eacute; Le Chien; for it was impo&s;&s;ible to proceed any further without pre&s;ents to en&s;ure me a favorable reception. This I did in the beginning of the year 1767, and finding my pro|gre&s;s to the we&s;tward thus retarded, I determined to direct my cour&s;e northward. I took this &s;tep with a view of finding a communication from the Heads of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi into Lake Superior, in order to meet, at the grand Portage on the North-we&s;t &s;ide of that lake, the traders that u&s;ually come, about this &s;ea&s;on, from Michillimackinac. Of the&s;e I intended to purcha&s;e goods, and then to pur&s;ue my journey from that quar|ter, by way of the lakes du Pluye, Dubois, and Ou|nipique to the Heads of the River of the We&s;t, which, as I have &s;aid before, falls into the Straits of Annian, the termination of my intended progre&s;s.</P>
<P>I accompli&s;hed the former part of my de&s;ign, and reached Lake Superior in proper time; but unluckily the traders I met there, acquainted me, that they had no goods to &s;pare; tho&s;e they had with them being barely &s;ufficient to an&s;wer their own demands in the&s;e remote parts. Thus di&s;appointed a &s;econd time, I found my&s;elf obliged to return to the place from whence I be|gan my expedition, which I did after continuing &s;ome months on the north and ea&s;t borders of Lake Superior, and exploring the bays and rivers that empty them|&s;elves into this large body of water.</P>
<P>As it may be expected that I &s;hould lay before the public the rea&s;ons that the&s;e di&s;coveries, of &s;o much im|portance to every one who has any connections with America, have not been imparted to them before, not|with&s;tanding they were made upwards of ten years ago. I will give them to the world in a plain and candid manner, and without mingling with them any complaints on account of the ill treatment I have received.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="021728_0021_0FB537C7592CC748">On my arrival in England, I pre&s;ented a petition to his Maje&s;ty in council, praying for a reimbur&s;ement of tho&s;e &s;ums I had expended in the &s;ervice of government. This was referred to the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade and Plantations. Their Lord&s;hips from the tenor of it thought the intelligence I could give, of &s;o much import|ance to the nation, that they ordered me to appear before the Board. This me&s;&s;age I obeyed, and underwent a long examination; much I believe to the &s;atisfaction of every Lord pre&s;ent. When it was fini&s;hed, I reque&s;ted to know what I &s;hould do with my papers; without he&s;itation the fir&s;t Lord replied, That I might publi&s;h them whenever I plea&s;ed. In con&s;equence of this permi&s;&s;ion, I di&s;po&s;ed of them to a book&s;eller: but when they were nearly rea|dy for the pre&s;s, an order was i&s;&s;ued from the council board, requiring me to deliver, without delay, into the Plantation Office, all my Charts and Journals, with every paper relative to the di&s;coveries I had made. In order to obey this command, I was obliged to re-pur|cha&s;e them from the book&s;eller at a very great expence, and deliver them up. This fre&s;h di&s;bur&s;ement I endea|vored to get annexed to the account I had already de|livered in; but the reque&s;t was denied me, notwith&s;tand|ing I had only acted, in the di&s;po&s;al of my papers, con|formably to the permi&s;&s;ion I had received from the Board of Trade. This lo&s;s, which amounted to a very con&s;iderable &s;um, I was obliged to bear, and to re&s;t &s;a|tisfied with an indemnification for my other expences.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, my only expectations are from the fa|vor of a generous public; to whom I &s;hall now com|municate my plans, journals, and ob&s;ervations, of which I luckily kept copies, when I delivered the originals into the Plantation Office. And this I do the more readily, as I hear they are mi&s;laid: and there is no pro|bability of their ever being publi&s;hed. To tho&s;e who are intere&s;ted in the concerns of the interior parts of North-America, from the contiguity of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or commercial engagements, they will be extremely u&s;e|ful, and fully repay the &s;um at which they are pur|cha&s;ed. To tho&s;e, who, from a laudable curio&s;ity, wi&s;h to be acquainted with the manners and cu&s;toms of every
<PB N="vii" REF="021728_0022_0FB537C8DACF8A68">
inhabitant of this globe, the accounts here given of the various nations that inhabit &s;o va&s;t a tract of it, a coun|try hitherto almo&s;t unexplored, will furni&s;h an ample fund of amu&s;ement, and gratify their mo&s;t curious ex|pectations. And I flatter my&s;elf they will be as favora|bly received by the public, as de&s;criptions of i&s;lands, which afford no other entertainment than what ari&s;es from their novelty; and di&s;coveries, that &s;eem to pro|mi&s;e very few advantages to this country, though ac|quired at an immen&s;e expence.</P>
<P>To make the following work as comprehen&s;ible and entertaining as po&s;&s;ible, I &s;hall fir&s;t give my readers an account of the route I pur&s;ued over this immen&s;e con|tinent, and as I pa&s;s on, de&s;cribe the number of inhabi|tants, the &s;ituation of the rivers and lakes, and the pro|ductions of the country. Having done this, I &s;hall treat, in di&s;tinct chapters, of the manners, cu&s;toms, and languages of the Indians, and to complete the whole, add a vocabulary of the words mo&s;tly in u&s;e among them.</P>
<P>And here it is nece&s;&s;ary to be&s;peak the candor of the learned part of my readers in the peru&s;al of it, as it is the production of a per&s;on unu&s;ed, from oppo&s;ite avoca|tions, to literary pur&s;uits. He therefore begs they would not examine it with too critical an eye; e&s;pecially when he a&s;&s;ures them that his attention has been more employ|ed on giving a ju&s;t de&s;cription of a country that promi&s;es, in &s;ome future period, to be an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of riches to that people who &s;hall be &s;o fortunate as to po&s;|&s;e&s;s it, than on the &s;tyle or compo&s;ition; and more care|ful to render his language intelligible and explicit, than &s;mooth and florid.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A JOURNAL OF THE TRAVELS, WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY, LAKES,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN June 1766, I &s;at out from Bo&s;ton, and proceed|ed by way of Albany and Niagara, to Michillimac|kinac; a fort &s;ituated between the Lakes Huron and Michigan, and di&s;tant from Bo&s;ton 1300 miles. This being the uttermo&s;t of our factories towards the north-we&s;t, I con&s;idered it as the mo&s;t convenient place from whence I could begin by intended progre&s;s, and enter at once into the regions I de&s;igned to explore.</P>
<P>Referring my readers to the publications already ex|tant for an account of tho&s;e parts of North-America, that, from lying adjacent to the back &s;ettlements, have been frequently de&s;cribed, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to a de&s;cription of the more interior parts of it, which having been but &s;eldom vi&s;ited, are con&s;equently but little known. In doing this, I &s;hall in no in&s;tance exceed the bounds of truth, or have recour&s;e to tho&s;e u&s;ele&s;s and ex|travagant exaggerations too often made u&s;e of by travel|lers, to excite the curio&s;ity of the public, or to increa&s;e their own importance. Nor &s;hall I in&s;ert any ob&s;ervati|ons,
<PB N="10" REF="021728_0024_0FB537CC999F7E78">
but &s;uch as I have made my&s;elf, or, from the cre|dibility of tho&s;e by whom they were related, am enabled to vouch for their authenticity.</P>
<P>Michillimackinac, from whence I began my travels, is a fort compo&s;ed of a &s;trong &s;tockade, and is u&s;ually defended by a garri&s;on of one hundred men. It con|tains about thirty hou&s;es, one of which belongs to the governor, and another to the commi&s;&s;ary. Several tra|ders al&s;o dwell within its fortifications, who find it a con|venient &s;ituation to traffic with the neighboring nations. Michillimackinac, in the language of the Chip&eacute;way In|dians, &s;ignifies a Tortoi&s;e; and the place is &s;uppo&s;ed to receive its name from an i&s;land, lying about &s;ix or &s;even miles to the north-ea&s;t, within &s;ight of the fort, which has the appearance of that animal.</P>
<P>During the Indian war that followed &s;oon after the conque&s;t of Canada in the year 1763, and which was car|ried on by an army of confederate nations, compo&s;ed of the Hurons, Miamies, Chip&eacute;ways, Ottowaws, Pontow|attimies, Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;auges, and &s;ome other tribes, under the direction of Pontiac, a celebrated Indian warrior, who had always been in the French intere&s;t, it was taken by &s;urprize in the following manner: The Indians having &s;ettled their plan, drew near the fort, and began a game at ball, a pa&s;time much u&s;ed among them, and not unlike tennis. In the height of their game, at which &s;ome of the Engli&s;h officers, not &s;u&s;pecting any deceit, &s;tood looking on, they &s;truck the ball, as if by accident, over the &s;tockade; this they repeated two or three times, to make the deception more complete; till at length, having by this means lulled every &s;u&s;pi|cion of the centry at the &s;outh gate, a party ru&s;hed by him; and the re&s;t &s;oon following, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort, without meeting with any oppo&s;ition: Hav|ing accompli&s;hed their de&s;ign, the Indians had the hu|manity to &s;pare the lives of the greate&s;t part of the garri&s;on and traders, but they made them all pri&s;oners, and carried them off. However, &s;ome time after they took them to Montreal, where they were redeemed at a good price. The fort al&s;o was given up again to the Engli&s;h at the peace made with Pontiac, by the com|mander of Detroit the year following.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="021728_0025_0FB537CED8513070">Having here made the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions for pur|&s;uing my travels, and obtained a credit from Mr. Rogers, the governor, on &s;ome Engli&s;h and Canadian traders, who were going to trade on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and re|ceived al&s;o from him a promi&s;e of a fre&s;h &s;upply of goods when I reached the falls of Saint Anthony. I left the fort on the 3d of September, in company with the&s;e traders. It was agreed that they &s;hould furni&s;h me with &s;uch goods as I might want, for pre&s;ents to the Indian chiefs, during my continuance with them, agreeable to the governor's order. But when I arrived at the extent of their route, I was to find other guides, and to depend on the goods the governor had promi&s;ed to &s;upply me with.</P>
<P>We accordingly &s;et out together, and on the 18th arrived at Fort La Bay. This fort is &s;ituated on the &s;outhern extremity of a bay in Lake Michigan, termed by the French, the Bay of Puants; but which, &s;ince the Engli&s;h have gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the &s;ettlements on this part of the continent, is called by them, the Green Bay. The rea&s;on of its being thus denominated, is from its appearance; for on leaving Michillimackinac in the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on, though the trees there have not even put forth their buds, yet you find the country around La Bay, notwith&s;tanding the pa&s;&s;age has not exceeded fourteen days, covered with the fine&s;t verdure, and ve|getation as forward as it could be were it &s;ummer.</P>
<P>This fort is al&s;o only &s;urrounded by a &s;tockade, and being much decayed, is &s;carcely defen&s;ible again&s;t &s;mall arms. It was built by the French for the protection of their trade, &s;ome time before they were forced to relin|qui&s;h it; and when Canada and its dependencies were &s;urrendered to the Engli&s;h, it was immediately garri|&s;oned with an officer and thirty men. The&s;e were made pri&s;oners by the Menomonies &s;oon after the &s;urpi&s;e of Michillimackinac, and the fort has neither been garri|&s;oned or kept in repair &s;ince.</P>
<P>The bay is about ninety miles long, but differs much in its breadth; being in &s;ome places only fifteen miles, in others from twenty to thirty. It lies nearly from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t. At the entrance of it from
<PB N="12" REF="021728_0026_0FB537D299A55690">
the lake are a &s;tring of i&s;lands, extending from north to &s;outh, called the Grand Traver&s;e. The&s;e are about thir|ty miles in length, and &s;erve to facilitate the pa&s;&s;age of canoes, as they &s;helter them from the winds, which &s;ometimes come with violence acro&s;s the Lake. On the &s;ide that lies to the &s;outh-ea&s;t is the neare&s;t and be&s;t na|vigation.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands of the Grand Traver&s;e are mo&s;tly &s;mall and rocky. Many of the rocks are of an amazing &s;ize, and appear as if they had been fa&s;hioned by the hands of arti&s;ts. On the large&s;t and be&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands &s;tands a town of the Ottowaws, at which I found one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable chiefs of that nation, who received me with every honor he could po&s;&s;ibly &s;how to a &s;tran|ger. But what appeared extremely &s;ingular to me at the time, and mu&s;t do &s;o to every per&s;on unacquainted with the cu&s;toms of the Indians, was the reception I met with on landing. As our canoes approached the &s;hore, and had reached within about three&s;core rods of it, the Indians began a feu-de-joy; in which they fired their pieces loaded with balls; but at the &s;ame time they took care to di&s;charge them in &s;uch a manner as to fly a few yards above our heads: during this they ran from one tree or &s;tump to another, &s;houting and behav|ing as if they were in the heat of battle. At fir&s;t I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, and was on the point of ordering my attendants to return their fire, concluding that their intentions were ho&s;tile; but being undeceived by &s;ome of the traders, who informed me that this was their u&s;u|al method of receiving the chiefs of other nations, I con|&s;idered it in its true light, and was plea&s;ed with the re|&s;pect thus paid me.</P>
<P>I remained here one night. Among the pre&s;ents I made the chiefs, were &s;ome &s;pirituous liquors; with which they made them&s;elves merry, and all joined in a dance, that la&s;ted the greate&s;t part of the night. In the morning when I departed, the chief attended me to the &s;hore, and, as &s;oon as I had embarked, offered up, in an audible voice, and with great &s;olemnity, a fervent prayer in my behalf. He prayed "that the Great Spirit would favor me with a pro&s;perous voyage;
<PB N="13" REF="021728_0027_0FB537D4D945F0B0">
that he would give me an unclouded &s;ky, and &s;mooth waters, by day, and that I might lie down, by night, on a beaver blanket, enjoying uninterrupted &s;leep, and plea&s;ant dreams; and al&s;o that I might find continual protection under the great pipe of peace." In this man|ner he continued his petitions till I could no longer hear them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that notwith&s;tanding the inhabi|tants of Europe are apt to entertain horrid ideas of the ferocity of the&s;e &s;avages, as they are termed, I received from every tribe of them in the interior parts, the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable and courteous treatment; and am convinced, that till they are contaminated by the example, and &s;pirituous liquors of their more refined neighbors, they retain this friendly and inoffen&s;ive conduct towards &s;tran|gers. Their inveteracy and cruelty to their enemies, I acknowledge to be a great abatement of the favorable opinion I would wi&s;h to entertain of them; but this failing is hereditary, and having received the &s;anction of immemorial cu&s;tom, has taken too deep root in their minds to be ever extirpated.</P>
<P>Among this people I eat of a very uncommon kind of bread. The Indians, in general, u&s;e but little of this nutritious food: whil&s;t their corn is in the milk, as they term it, that is, ju&s;t before it begins to ripen, they &s;lice off the kernels from the cob to which they grow, and knead them into a pa&s;te. This they are enabled to do without the addition of any liquid, by the milk that flows from them; and when it is effect|ed, they parcel it out into cakes, and enclo&s;ing them in leaves of the ba&s;&s;wood tree, place them in hot embers, where they are &s;oon baked. And better flavored bread I never eat in any country.</P>
<P>This place is only a &s;mall village containing about twenty-five hou&s;es and &s;ixty or &s;eventy warriors. I found nothing there worthy of further remark.</P>
<P>The land on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the Green Bay, is but very indifferent, being over&s;pread with a heavy growth of hemlock, pine, &s;pruce, and fir trees. The communication between Lake Michigan and the Green Bay, has been reported by &s;ome to be impracticable for
<PB N="14" REF="021728_0028_0FB537D659A575D0">
the pa&s;&s;age of any ve&s;&s;els larger than canoes or boats, on account of the &s;hoals that lie between the i&s;lands in the Grand Traver&s;e; but on &s;ounding it I found &s;ufficient depth for a ve&s;&s;el of &s;ixty tons, and the breadth propor|tionable.</P>
<P>The land adjoining to the bottom of this bay is very fertile, the country in general level, and the per&s;pective view of it plea&s;ing and exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>A few families live in the fort, which lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Fox River, and oppo&s;ite to it, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of its entrance, are &s;ome French &s;ettlers who culti|vate the land, and appear to live very comfortably.</P>
<P>The Green Bay or Bay of Puants is one of tho&s;e places to which the French, as I have mentioned in the introduction, have given nicknames. It is termed by the inhabitants of its coa&s;ts, the Menomonie Bay; but why the French have denominated it the Puant or Stink|ing Bay, I know not. The rea&s;on they them&s;elves give for it is, that it was not with a view to mi&s;lead &s;trangers, but that by adopting this method, they could conver&s;e with each other concerning the Indians, in their pre|&s;ence, without being under&s;tood by them. For it was remarked by the per&s;ons who fir&s;t traded among them, that when they were &s;peaking to each other about them, and mentioned their proper name, they in&s;tantly grew &s;u&s;picious, and concluded that their vi&s;iters were either &s;peaking ill of them, or plotting their de&s;truction. To remedy this they gave them &s;ome other name. The on|ly bad con&s;equence ari&s;ing from the practice then intro|duced is, that Engli&s;h and French geographers, in their plans of the interior parts of America, give different names to the &s;ame people, and thereby perplex tho&s;e who have occa&s;ion to refer to them.</P>
<P>Lake Michigan, of which the Green Bay is a part, is divided on the north-ea&s;t from Lake Huron by the Straits of Michillimackinac; and is &s;ituated betwen for|ty-two and forty-&s;ix degrees of latitude, and between eighty-four and eighty-&s;even degrees of we&s;t-longitude. Its greate&s;t length is two hundred and eighty miles, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> breadth about forty, and its circumference nearly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hundred. There is a remarkable &s;tring of &s;mall i&s;land<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="15" REF="021728_0029_0FB537D7D9087A50">
beginning over again&s;t A&s;kin's Farm, and running about thirty miles &s;outh-we&s;t into the Lake. The&s;e are called the Beaver I&s;lands. Their &s;ituation is very plea&s;ant, but the &s;oil is bare. However they afford a beautiful pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>On the north-we&s;t parts of this lake the waters branch out into two bays. That which lies towards the north is the Bay of Noquets, and the other the Green Bay ju&s;t de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The waters of this as well as the other great lakes are clear and whole&s;ome, and of &s;ufficient depth for the na|vigation of large &s;hips. Half the &s;pace of the country that lies to the ea&s;t, and extends to Lake Huron, be|longs to the Ottowaw Indians. The line that divides their territories from the Chip&eacute;ways, runs nearly north and &s;outh, and reaches almo&s;t from the &s;outhern extremi|ty of this lake, acro&s;s the high lands, to Michillimacki|nac, through the center of which it pa&s;&s;es. So that when the&s;e two tribes happen to meet at the factory, they each encamp on their own dominions, at a few yards di&s;tance from the &s;tockade.</P>
<P>The country adjacent either to the ea&s;t or we&s;t &s;ide of this lake, is compo&s;ed but of an indifferent &s;oil, except where &s;mall brooks or rivers empty them&s;elves into it; on the banks of the&s;e it is extremely fertile. Near the bor|ders of the lake grow a great number of &s;and cherries, which are not le&s;s remarkable for their manner of growth, than for their exqui&s;ite flavor. They grow upon a &s;mall &s;hrub, not more than four feet high, the boughs of which are &s;o loaded that they lie in clu&s;ters on the &s;and. As they grow only on the &s;and, the warmth of which probably contributes to bring them to &s;uch perfection; they are called by the French, cherries de &s;able, or &s;and cherries. The &s;ize of them does not exceed that of a &s;mall mu&s;ket ball, but they are reckoned &s;uperior to any other &s;ort for the purpo&s;e of &s;teeping in &s;pirits. There al&s;o grow around the lake, goo&s;eberries, black currants, and an abundance of juniper, bearing great quantities of berries of the fine&s;t &s;ort.</P>
<P>Sumack likewi&s;e grows here in great plenty; the leaf of which, gathered at Michaelmas, when it turns red, is much e&s;teemed by the natives. They mix about an
<PB N="16" REF="021728_0030_0FB537DD7AA7DA98">
equal quantity of it with their tobacco, which cau&s;es it to &s;moke plea&s;antly. Near this lake, and indeed about all the great lakes, is found a kind of willow, termed by the French, bois rouge, in Engli&s;h, red wood. Its bark, when only of one year's growth, is of a fine &s;carlet co|lor, and appears very beautiful; but as it grows older, it changes into a mixture of grey and red. The &s;talks of this &s;hrub grow many of them together, and ri&s;e to the height of &s;ix or eight feet, the large&s;t not exceeding an inch diameter. The bark being &s;craped from the &s;ticks, and dried and powdered, is al&s;o mixed by the Indians with their tobacco, and is held by them in the highe&s;t e&s;timation for their winter &s;mol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng. A weed that grows near the great lakes, in rocky places, they u&s;e in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. It is called by the Indians, Segockimac, and creeps like a vine on the ground, &s;ome|times extending to eight or ten feet, and bearing a leaf about the &s;ize of a &s;ilver penny, nearly round; it is of the &s;ub&s;tance and color of the laurel, and is, like the tree it re&s;embles, an evergreen. The&s;e leaves, dried and pow|dered, they likewi&s;e mix with their tobacco; and, as &s;aid before, &s;moke it only during the &s;ummer. By the&s;e three &s;uccedaneums, the pipes of the Indians are well &s;upplied through every &s;ea&s;on of the year; and as they are great &s;mokers, they are very careful in properly ga|thering and preparing them.</P>
<P>On the 20th of September I left the Green Bay, and proceeded up Fox River, &s;till in company with the traders and &s;ome Indians. On the 25th I arrived at the great town of the Winnebagoes, &s;ituated on a &s;mall i&s;land, ju&s;t as you enter the ea&s;t end of Lake Winneba|go. Here the queen who pre&s;ided over this tribe in&s;tead of a Sachem, received me with great civility, and enter|tained me in a very di&s;tingui&s;hed manner, during the four days I continued with her.</P>
<P>The day after my arrival I held a council with the chiefs, of whom I a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s through their country, in my way to more remote nations, on bu&s;ine&s;s of importance. This was readily granted me, the reque&s;t being e&s;teemed by them as a great compliment paid to their tribe. The queen &s;at in the council, but only
<PB N="17" REF="021728_0031_0FB537DE98104358">
a&s;ked a few que&s;tions, or gave &s;ome trifling directions in matters relative to the &s;tate; for women are never allow|ed to &s;it in their councils, except they happen to be in|ve&s;ted with the &s;upreme authority, and then it is not cu&s;tomary for them to make any formal &s;peeches as the chiefs do. She was a very ancient woman, &s;mall in &s;tature, and not much di&s;tingui&s;hed by her dre&s;s from &s;everal young women, that attended her. The&s;e her at|tendants &s;eemed greatly plea&s;ed whenever I &s;howed any tokens of re&s;pect to their queen, particularly when I &s;aluted her, which I frequently did to acquire her favor. On the&s;e occa&s;ions the good old lady endeavored to a&s;|&s;ume a juvenile gaiety, and by her &s;miles &s;howed &s;he was equally plea&s;ed with the attention I paid her.</P>
<P>The time I tarried here, I employed in making the be&s;t ob&s;ervations po&s;&s;ible on the country, and in collect|ing the mo&s;t certain intelligence I could, of the origin, language, and cu&s;toms of this people. From the&s;e en|quiries I have rea&s;on to conclude, that the Winneba|goes originally re&s;ided in &s;ome of the provinces belong|ing to New Mexico; and being driven from their na|tive country, either by inte&s;tine divi&s;ions, or by the ex|ten&s;ions of the Spani&s;h conque&s;ts, they took refuge in the&s;e more northern parts about a century ago.</P>
<P>My rea&s;ons for adopting this &s;uppo&s;ition, are, Fir&s;t, from their unalienable attachment to the Naudowe&s;&s;ie In|dians (who, they &s;ay, gave them the earlie&s;t &s;uccors during their emigration) notwith&s;tanding their pre&s;ent re&s;idence is more than &s;ix hundred miles di&s;tant from that people.</P>
<P>Secondly, that their dialect totally differs from eve|ry other Indian nation yet di&s;covered; it being a very uncouth, guttural jargon, which none of their neighbors will attempt to learn. They conver&s;e with other nations in the Chip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">way tongue, which is the prevailing language throughout all the tribes, from the Mohawks of Cana|da, to tho&s;e who inhabit the borders of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and from the Hurons and Illinois to &s;uch as dwell near Hud&s;on's Bay.</P>
<P>Thirdly, from their inveterate hatred to the Spani|ards. Some of them informed me that, they had many
<PB N="18" REF="021728_0032_0FB537E0D94A6168">
excur&s;ions to the &s;outh-we&s;t, which took up &s;everal moons. An elderly chief more particularly acquainted me, that about forty-&s;ix winters ago, he marched at the head of fifty warriors, toward the &s;outh-we&s;t, for three moons. That during this expedition, whil&s;t they were cro&s;&s;ing a plain, they di&s;covered a body of men on hor&s;e|back, who belonged to the Black People; for &s;o they call the Spaniards. As &s;oon as they perceived them, they proceeded with caution, and concealed them&s;elves till night came on; when they drew &s;o near as to be able to di&s;cern the number and &s;ituation of their enemies. Finding they were not able to cope with &s;o great a &s;u|periority by day-light, they waited till they had retired to re&s;t; when they ru&s;hed upon them, and, after having killed the greate&s;t part of the men, took eighty hor&s;es loaded with what they termed white &s;tone. This I &s;up|po&s;e to have been &s;ilver, as he told me the hor&s;es were &s;hod with it, and that their bridles were ornamented with the &s;ame. When they had &s;atiated their revenge, they carried off their &s;poil, and being got &s;o far as to be out of the reach of the Spaniards that had e&s;caped their fury, they left the u&s;ele&s;s and ponderous burthen, with which the hor&s;es were loaded, in the woods, and mount|ing them&s;elves, in this manner returned to their friends. The party they had thus defeated, I conclude to be the caravan that annually conveys to Mexico, the &s;ilver which the Spaniards find in great quantities on the mountains lying near the heads of the Coleredo River: and the plains where the attack was made, probably, &s;ome they were obliged to pa&s;s over in their way to the heads of the River St. Fee, or Rio del Nord, which falls into the Gulf of Mexico, to the we&s;t of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.</P>
<P>The Winnebagoes can rai&s;e about two hundred war|riors. Their town contains about fifty hou&s;es, which are &s;trongly built with pali&s;ades, and the i&s;land on which it is &s;ituated, nearly fifty acres. It lies thirty-five miles, reckoning according to the cour&s;e of the river, from the Green Bay.</P>
<P>The river, for about four or five miles from the bay, has a gentle current; after that &s;pace, till you arrive at
<PB N="19" REF="021728_0033_0FB537E37929F8E0">
the Winnebago Lake, it is full of rocks and very rapid. At many places we were obliged to land our canoes, and carry them a con&s;iderable way. Its breadth, in general, from the Green Bay to the Winnebago Lake, is be|tween &s;eventy and a hundred yards: the land on its borders very good, and thinly wooded with hickory, oak, and hazel.</P>
<P>The Winnebago Lake is about fifteen miles long from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and &s;ix miles wide. At its &s;outh-ea&s;t cor|ner, a river falls into it that takes its ri&s;e near &s;ome of the northern branches of the Illinois River. This I called the Crocodile River, in con&s;equence of a &s;tory that prevails among the Indians, of their having de&s;troy|ed, in &s;ome part of it, an animal, which from their de|&s;cription mu&s;t be a crocodile or an alligator.</P>
<P>The land adjacent to the Lake is very fertile, abound|ing with grapes, plums, and other fruits, which grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly. The Winnebagoes rai&s;e on it a great quantity of Indian corn, beans, pumpkins, &s;qua&s;hes, and water melons, with &s;ome tobacco. The Lake it&s;elf abounds with fi&s;h, and in the fall of the year, with gee&s;e, ducks, and teal. The latter, which re&s;ort to it in great numbers, are remarkably good and extremely fat, and are much better flavored than tho&s;e that are found near the &s;ea, as they acquire their exce&s;&s;ive fatne&s;s by feeding on the wild rice, which grows &s;o plentifully in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Having made &s;ome acceptable pre&s;ents to the good old queen, and received her ble&s;&s;ing, I left the town of the Winnebagoes on the 29th of September, and about twelve miles from it, arrived at the place where the Fox River enters the Lake on the north &s;ide of it. We proceeded up this river, and on the 7th of October reached the great Carrying Place, which divides it from the Oui&s;con&s;in.</P>
<P>The Fox River, from the Green Bay to the Carrying Place, is about one hundred and eighty miles. From the Winnebago Lake to the Carrying Place the current is gentle, and the depth of it con&s;iderable; notwith|&s;tanding which, it is in &s;ome places with difficulty that canoes can pa&s;s, through the ob&s;tructions they
<PB N="20" REF="021728_0034_0FB537E49AA7CE88">
meet with from the rice &s;talks, which are very large and thick, and grow here in great abundance. The country around it is very fertile, and proper in the highe&s;t degree for cultivation, excepting in &s;ome places near the river, where it is rather too low. It is in no part very woody, and yet can &s;upply &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the demands of any number of inhabitants. This river is the greate&s;t re&s;ort for wild fowl of every kind, that I met with in the whole cour&s;e of my travels; frequently the &s;un would be ob&s;cured by them for &s;ome minutes together.</P>
<P>About forty miles up this river, from the great town of the Winnebagoes, &s;tands a &s;maller town belonging to that nation.</P>
<P>Deer and bears are very numerous in the&s;e parts, and a great many beavers and other furs are taken on the &s;treams that empty them&s;elves into this river.</P>
<P>The river I am treating of, is remarkable for having been, about eighty years ago, the re&s;idence of the united bands of the Ottigaumies and the Saukies, whom the French had nicknamed, according to their wonted cu&s;tom, Des Sacs and Des Reynards, the Sacks and the Foxes, of whom the following anecdote was related to me by an Indian.</P>
<P>About &s;ixty years ago, the French mi&s;&s;ionaries and traders having received many in&s;ults from the&s;e people, a party of French and Indians, under the command of Captain Morand marched to revenge their wrongs. The Captain &s;et out from the Green Bay in the winter, when they were un&s;u&s;picious of a vi&s;it of this kind, and pur&s;uing his route over the &s;now to their villages, which lay about fifty miles up the Fox River, came up|on them by &s;urpri&s;e. Unprepared as they were, he found them an ea&s;y conque&s;t, and con&s;equently killed or took pri&s;oners the greate&s;t part of them. On the re|turn of the French to the Green Bay, one of the Indi|an chiefs in alliance with them, who had a con&s;iderable band of the pri&s;oners under his care, &s;topped to drink at a brook; in the mean time his companions went on: which being ob&s;erved by one of the women whom they had made captive, &s;he &s;uddenly &s;eized him with both
<PB N="21" REF="021728_0035_0FB537E6197420E8">
her hands, whil&s;t he &s;tooped to drink, by an exqui&s;itely &s;u&s;ceptible part, and held him fa&s;t till he expired on the &s;pot. As the chief, from the extreme torture he &s;uffer|ed, was unable to call out to his friends, or to give any alarm, they pa&s;&s;ed on without knowing what had hap|pened; and the woman having cut the bands of tho&s;e of her fellow pri&s;oners who were in the rear, with them made her e&s;cape. This heroine was ever after treated by her nation as their deliverer, and made a chiefe&s;s in her own right, with liberty to entail the &s;ame honor on her de&s;cendants: an unu&s;ual di&s;tinction, and permit|ted only on extraordinary occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>About twelve miles before I reached the Carrying Place, I ob&s;erved &s;everal &s;mall mountains which extend|ed quite to it. The&s;e indeed would only be e&s;teemed as molehills, when compared with tho&s;e on the back of the colonies, but as they were the fir&s;t I had &s;een &s;ince my leaving Niagara, a track of nearly eleven hundred miles, I could not leave them unnoticed.</P>
<P>The Fox River, where it enters the Winnebago Lake, is about fifty yards wide, but it gradually decrea&s;es to the Carrying Place, where it is no more than five yards over, except in a few places where it widens into &s;mall lakes, though &s;till of a con&s;iderable depth. I cannot re|collect any thing el&s;e that is remarkable in this river, ex|cept that it is &s;o &s;erpentine for five miles, as only to gain in that place one quarter of a mile.</P>
<P>The Carrying Place between the Fox and Oui&s;con&s;in Rivers is in breadth not more than a mile and three quarters, though in &s;ome maps it is &s;o delineated as to appear to be ten miles. And here I cannot help remark|ing, that all the maps of the&s;e parts, I have ever &s;een, are very erroneous. The rivers in general are de&s;cribed as running in different directions from what they really do; and many branches of them, particularly of the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi, omitted. The di&s;tances of places, likewi&s;e, are greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented. Whether this is done by the French geographers (for the Engli&s;h maps are all copied from theirs) through de&s;ign, or for want of a ju&s;t know|ledge of the country, I cannot &s;ay; but I am &s;atisfied
<PB N="22" REF="021728_0036_0FB537E859B14D10">
that travellers who depend upon them in the parts I vi|&s;ited, will find them&s;elves much at a lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Near one half of the way, between the rivers, is a mo|ra&s;s overgrown with a kind of long gra&s;s, the re&s;t of it a plain with &s;ome few oak and pine trees growing there|on. I ob&s;erved here a great number of rattle-&s;nakes. Mon&s;. Pinni&s;ance, a French trader, told me a remarka|ble &s;tory concerning one of the&s;e reptiles, of which he &s;aid, he was an eye-witne&s;s. An Indian, belonging to the Menomonie nation, having taken one of them, found means to tame it; and when he had done this, treated it as a Deity; calling it his Great Father, and carrying it with him, in a box, wherever he went. This the Indian had done for &s;everal &s;ummers, when Mon&s;. Pinni&s;ance accidentally met with him at this Carrying Place, ju&s;t as he was &s;etting off for a winter's hunt. The French gentleman was &s;urpri&s;ed, one day, to &s;ee the In|dian place the box which contained his god, on the ground, and opening the door, give him his liberty; telling him, whil&s;t he did it, to be &s;ure and return by the time he him&s;elf &s;hould come back, which was to be in the month of May following. As this was but Oc|tober, Mon&s;ieur told the Indian, who&s;e &s;implicity a&s;to|ni&s;hed him, that he fancied he might wait long enough when May arrived, for the arrival of his great father. The Indian was &s;o confident of his creature's obedience, that he offered to lay the Frenchman a wager of two gallons of rum, that at the time appointed he would come and crawl into his box. This was agreed on, and the &s;econd week in May following, fixed for the determina|tion of the wager. At that period they both met there again; when the Indian &s;et down his box, and called for his great father. The &s;nake heard him not; and the time being now expired, he acknowledged that he had lo&s;t. However, without &s;eeming to be di&s;couraged, he offered to double the bet, if his great father came not within two days more. This was further agreed on; when behold on the &s;econd day, about one o'clock, the &s;nake arrived, and, of his own accord crawled into the box, which was placed ready for him. The French gen|tleman vouched for the truth of this &s;tory, and from the
<PB N="23" REF="021728_0037_0FB537EE33E08098">
accounts I have often received of the docility of tho&s;e creatures, I &s;ee no rea&s;on to doubt his veracity.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved that the main body of the Fox River came from the &s;outh-we&s;t, that of the Oui&s;con&s;in from the north-ea&s;t; and al&s;o that &s;ome of the &s;mall branches of the&s;e two rivers, in de&s;cending into them, doubled, within a few feet of each other, a little to the &s;outh of the Carrying Place. That two &s;uch rivers &s;hould take their ri&s;e &s;o near each other, and after running &s;uch different cour&s;es, empty them&s;elves into the &s;ea, at a di&s;tance &s;o amazing (for the former having pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal great lakes, and run upwards of two thou&s;and miles, falls into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the other, after joining the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and having run an equal number of miles, di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the Gulf of Mex|ico) is an in&s;tance &s;carcely to be met in the exten&s;ive continent of North-America. I had an opportunity the year following, of making the &s;ame ob&s;ervations on the affinity of various head branches of the waters of the St. Lawrence and the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi to each other; and now bring them as a proof, that the opinion of tho&s;e geographers, who a&s;&s;ert, that rivers taking their ri&s;e &s;o near each other, mu&s;t &s;pring from the &s;ame &s;ource, is erroneous. For I perceived a vi&s;ibly di&s;tinct &s;eparation in all of them, notwith&s;tanding, in &s;ome places, they approached &s;o near, that I could have &s;tepped from one to the other.</P>
<P>On the 8th of October we got our canoes into the Oui&s;con&s;in River, which at this place is more than a hundred yards wide; and the next day arrived at the Great Town of the Saukies. This is the large&s;t and be&s;t built Indian town I ever &s;aw. It contains about ninety hou&s;es, each large enough for &s;everal families. The&s;e are built of hewn plank, neatly jointed, and co|vered with bark &s;o compactly as to keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the mo&s;t penetrating rains. Before the doors are placed comfort|able &s;heds, in which the inhabitants &s;it, when the wea|ther will permit, and &s;moke their pipes. The &s;treets are regular and &s;pacious; &s;o that it appears more like a ci|vilized town, than the abode of &s;avages. The land near the town is very good. In their plantations, which lie ad|jacent
<PB N="24" REF="021728_0038_0FB537F1A60B78B0">
to their hou&s;es, and which are neatly laid out, they rai&s;e great quantities of Indian corn, beans, me|lons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that this place is e&s;teemed the be&s;t market for traders to furni&s;h them&s;elves with provi&s;ions, of any within eight hundred miles of it.</P>
<P>The Saukies can rai&s;e about three hundred warriors, who are generally employed every &s;ummer in making incur&s;ions into the territories of the Illinois and Pawnee nations, from whence they return with a great number of &s;laves. But tho&s;e people frequently retaliate, and, in their turn, de&s;troy many of the Saukies, which I judge to be the rea&s;on that they increa&s;e no fa&s;ter.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I &s;taid here, I took a view of &s;ome moun|tains that lie about fifteen miles to the &s;outhward, and abound in lead ore. I a&s;cended on one of the highe&s;t of the&s;e, and had an exten&s;ive view of the country. For many miles nothing was to be &s;een but le&s;&s;er mountains, which appeared at a di&s;tance like haycocks, they being free from trees. Only a few groves of hickory, and &s;tunted oaks, covered &s;ome of the vallies. So plentiful is lead here, that I &s;aw large quantities of it lying about the &s;treets in the town belonging to the Saukies, and it &s;eemed to be as good as the produce of other countries.</P>
<P>On the 10th of October we proceeded down the ri|ver, and the next day reached the fir&s;t town of the Ottigaumies. This town contained about fifty hou&s;es, but we found mo&s;t of them de&s;erted, on account of an epidemical di&s;order that had lately raged among them, and carried off more than one half of the in|habitants. The greater part of tho&s;e who &s;urvived, had retired into the woods, to avoid the contagion.</P>
<P>On the 15th we entered that exten&s;ive river the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi. The Oui&s;con&s;in, from the Carrying Place to the part where it falls into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, flows with a &s;mooth, but &s;trong current; the water of it is exceed|ingly clear, and through it you may perceive a fine and &s;andy bottom, tolerably free from rocks. In it are a few i&s;lands, the &s;oil of which appeared to be good, though &s;omewhat woody. The land near the river al&s;o &s;eemed to be, in general, excellent; but that at a di&s;tance is very full of mountains, where it is &s;aid there are many lead mines.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="021728_0039_0FB537F2DB6ABCE0">About five miles from the junction of the rivers, I ob|&s;erved the ruins of a large town, in a very plea&s;ing &s;ituation. On enquiring of the neighboring Indians, why it was thus de&s;erted, I was informed, that about thirty years ago, the Great Spirit had appeared on the top of a pyramid of rocks, which lay at a little di&s;tance from it, towards the we&s;t, and warned them to quit their habita|tions; for the land on which they were built belonged to him, and he had occa&s;ion for it. As a proof that he, who gave them the&s;e orders, was really the Great Spirit, he further told them, that the gra&s;s &s;hould immediately &s;pring up on tho&s;e very rocks from whence he now ad|dre&s;&s;ed them, which they knew to be bare and barren. The Indians obeyed, and &s;oon after di&s;covered that this miraculous alteration had taken place. They &s;hewed me the &s;pot, but the growth of the gra&s;s appeared to be no ways &s;upernatural. I apprehend this to have been a &s;tra|tagem of the French or Spaniards, to an&s;wer &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h view; but in what manner they effected their purpo&s;es I know not.</P>
<P>This people, &s;oon after their removal, built a town on the bank of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, near the mouth of the Oui&s;con&s;in, at a place called by the French, La Prairies les Chiens, which &s;ignifies the Dog Plains; it is a large town, and contains about three hundred families; the hou&s;es are well built after the Indian manner, and plea|&s;antly &s;ituated on a very rich &s;oil, from which they rai&s;e every nece&s;&s;ary of life in great abundance. I &s;aw here many hor&s;es of a good &s;ize and &s;hape. This town is the great mart where all the adjacent tribes, and even tho&s;e who inhabit the mo&s;t remote branches of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, annually a&s;&s;emble about the latter end of May, bring|ing with them their furs to di&s;po&s;e of to the traders. But it is not always that they conclude their &s;ale here; this is determined by a general council of the chiefs, who con&s;ult whether it would be more conducive to their intere&s;t, to &s;ell their goods at this place, or carry them on to Loui&s;iana, or Michillimackinac. According to the deci&s;ion of this council, they either proceed further, or return to their different homes.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="021728_0040_0FB537F458225840">The Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, at the entrance of the Oui&s;con&s;in, near which &s;tands a mountain of con&s;iderable height, is about half a mile over; but oppo&s;ite to the la&s;t mentioned town it appears to be more than a mile wide, and full of i&s;lands, the &s;oil of which is extraordinary rich, and but thinly wooded.</P>
<P>A little further to the we&s;t, on the contrary &s;ide, a &s;mall river falls into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, which the French call Le Jaun Riviere, or the Yellow River. Here the traders who had accompanied me hitherto, took up their re&s;idence for the winter. I then bought a canoe, and with two &s;ervants, one a French Canadian, and the other a Mohawk of Canada, on the 19th proceeded up the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.</P>
<P>About ten days after I had parted from the traders, I landed as I u&s;ually did, every evening, and having pitch|ed my tent, I ordered my men, when night came on, to lay them&s;elves down to &s;leep. By a light that I kept burning I then &s;at down to copy the minutes I had taken in the cour&s;e of the preceding day. About ten o'clock, having ju&s;t fini&s;hed my memorandums, I &s;tepped out of my tent to &s;ee what weather it was. As I ca&s;t my eyes towards the bank of the river, I thought I &s;aw by the light of the &s;tars, which &s;hone bright, &s;omething that had the appearance of a herd of bea&s;ts, coming down a de&s;cent at &s;ome di&s;tance; whil&s;t I was wondering what they could be, one of the number &s;uddenly &s;prung up, and di&s;covered to me the form of a man. In an in&s;tant they were all on their legs, and I could count about ten or twelve of them running towards me. I immediately re-entered the tent, and having awakened my men, or|dered them to take their arms, and follow me. As my fir&s;t apprehen&s;ions were for my canoe, I ran to the water's &s;ide, and found a party of Indians (for &s;uch I now di&s;|covered them to be) on the point of plundering it. Be|fore I reached them, I commanded my men not to fire till I had given the word, being unwilling to begin ho&s;tilities unle&s;s occa&s;ion ab&s;olutely required. I accord|ingly advanced with re&s;olution, clo&s;e to the points of their &s;pears, they had no other weapons, and brandi&s;h|ing my hanger, a&s;ked them with a &s;tern voice, what they
<PB N="27" REF="021728_0041_0FB537F6E863AD08">
wanted? They were &s;taggered at this, and perceiving they were like to meet with a warm reception, turned about and precipitately retreated. We pur&s;ued them to an adjacent wood, which they entered, and we &s;aw no more of them. However, for fear of their return, we watched alternately during the remainder of the night. The next day&punc; my &s;ervants were under great apprehen|&s;ions, and earne&s;tly entreated me to return to the traders we had lately left. But I told them, that if they would not be e&s;teemed old women (a term of the greate&s;t re|proach among the Indians) they mu&s;t follow me; for I was determined to pur&s;ue my intended route, as an Engli&s;hman, when once engaged in an adventure, ne|ver retreated. On this they got into the canoe, and I walked on the &s;hore to guard them from any further attack. The party of Indians who had thus intended to plunder me, I afterwards found to be &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;traggling bands, that having been driven from among the different tribes to which they belonged, for various crimes, now a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves together, and, living by plunder, prove very trouble&s;ome to travellers who pa&s;s this way; nor are even Indians of every tribe &s;pared by them. The traders had before cautioned me to be upon my guard again&s;t them, and I would repeat the &s;ame caution to tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s might call them into the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of November I arrived at Lake Pepin, which is rather an extended part of the River Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, that the French have thus denominated, about two hun|dred miles from the Oui&s;con&s;in. The Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi below this lake, flows with a gentle current, but the breadth of it is very uncertain, in &s;ome places it being upwards of a mile, in others not more than a quarter. This river has a range of mountains on each &s;ide throughout the whole of the way; which in particular parts approach near to it, in others lie at a greater di&s;tance. The land betwixt the mountains, and on their &s;ides, is generally covered with gra&s;s, with a few groves of trees inter&s;per&s;|ed, near which, large droves of deer and elk are fre|quently &s;een feeding.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="021728_0042_0FB537FDD84005E8">In many places pyramids of rocks appeared, re&s;em|bling old ruinous towers; at others amazing precipices; and what is very remarkable, whil&s;t this &s;cene pre&s;ented it&s;elf on one &s;ide, the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;ame moun|tain was covered with the fine&s;t herbage, which gradu|ally a&s;cended to its &s;ummit. From thence the mo&s;t beau|tiful and exten&s;ive pro&s;pect that imagination can form, opens to your view. Verdant plains, fruitful meadows, numerous i&s;lands, and all the&s;e abounding with a variety of trees that yield amazing quantities of fruit, without care or cultivation; &s;uch as the nut-tree, the maple which produces &s;ugar, vines loaded with rich grapes, and plum-trees bending under their blooming burdens, but above all, the fine river flowing gently beneath, and reaching as far as the eye can extend, by turns at|tract your admiration and excite your wonder.</P>
<P>The Lake is about twenty miles long, and near &s;ix in breadth; in &s;ome places it is very deep, and abounds with various kinds of fi&s;h. Great numbers of fowl fre|quent al&s;o this Lake and the rivers adjacent; &s;uch as &s;torks, &s;wans, gee&s;e, brants, and ducks: and in the groves are found great plenty of turkeys and partridges. On the plains are the large&s;t buffaloes of any in Ame|rica. Here I ob&s;erved the ruins of a French factory, where it is &s;aid Captain St. Pierre re&s;ided, and carried on a very great trade with the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, before the reduction of Canada.</P>
<P>About &s;ixty miles below this Lake is a mountain re|markably &s;ituated; for it &s;tands by it&s;elf exactly in the middle of the River, and looks as if it had &s;lidden from the adjacent &s;hore into the &s;tream. It cannot be term|ed an i&s;land, as it ri&s;es immediately from the brink of the water to a con&s;iderable height. Both the Indians and the French call it the Mountain in the River.</P>
<P>One day having landed on the &s;hore of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, &s;ome miles below Lake Pepin, whil&s;t my attendants were preparing my dinner, I walked out to take a view of the adjacent country. I had not proceeded far, be|fore I came to a fine, level, open plain, on which I per|ceived at a little di&s;tance, a partial elevation that had the appearance of an intrenchment. On a nearer in&s;pec|tion
<PB N="29" REF="021728_0043_0FB537FED94B5B68">
I had greater rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it had really been intended for this many centuries ago. Notwith|&s;tanding it was now covered with gra&s;s, I could plainly di&s;cern that it had once been a brea&s;t-work of about four feet in height, extending the be&s;t part of a mile, and &s;ufficiently capacious to cover five thou&s;and men. Its form was &s;omewhat circular, and its flanks reached to the River. Though much defaced by time, every angle was di&s;tingui&s;hable, and appeared as regular, and fa&s;hioned with as much military &s;kill, as if planned by Vauban him&s;elf. The ditch was not vi&s;ible, but I thought on examining more curiou&s;ly, that I could perceive there certainly had been one. From its &s;ituation al&s;o, I am convinced that it mu&s;t have been de&s;igned for this pur|po&s;e. It fronted the country, and the rear was covered by the River; nor was there any ri&s;ing ground for a con|&s;iderable way, that commanded it; a few &s;traggling oaks were alone to be &s;een near it. In many places &s;mall tracts were worn acro&s;s it by the feet of the elks and deer, and from the depth of the bed of earth by which it was covered, I was able to draw certain conclu&s;ions of its great antiquity. I examined all the angles, and eve|ry part with great attention, and have often blamed my&s;elf &s;ince, for not encamping on the &s;pot, and draw|ing an exact plan of it. To &s;hew that this de&s;cription is not the offspring of a heated imagination, or the chimerical tale of a mi&s;taken traveller, I find on enqui|ry &s;ince my return, that Mon&s;. St Pierre and &s;everal traders, have, at different times, taken notice of &s;imilar appearances, on which they have formed the &s;ame con|jectures, but without examining them &s;o minutely as I did. How a work of this kind could exi&s;t in a country that has hitherto (according to the general received opi|nion) been the &s;eat of war to untutored Indians alone, who&s;e whole &s;tock of military knowledge has only, till within two centuries, amounted to drawing the bow, and who&s;e only brea&s;t-work, even at pre&s;ent, is the thicket, I know not. I have given as exact an account as po&s;&s;ible, of this &s;ingular appearance, and leave to fu|ture explorers of the&s;e di&s;tant region, to di&s;cover whe|ther it is a production of nature or art.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="021728_0044_0FB538011903B790">Perhaps the hints I have here given, might lead to a more perfect inve&s;tigation of it, and give us very diffe|rent ideas of the ancient &s;tate of realms that we at pre|&s;ent believe to have been from the earlie&s;t period only the habitations of &s;avages.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, as far as the entrance of the River St. Croix, thirty miles above Lake Pepin, is very full of i&s;lands; &s;ome of which are of a con&s;iderable length. On the&s;e al&s;o, grow great numbers of the maple or &s;u|gar tree, and around them, vines loaded with grapes, creeping to their very tops. From the Lake upwards, few mountains are to be &s;een, and tho&s;e but &s;mall. Near the River St. Croix, re&s;ide three bands of the Naudo|we&s;&s;ie Indians, called the River Bands.</P>
<P>This nation is compo&s;ed, at pre&s;ent, of eleven bands. They were originally twelve; but the A&s;&s;inipoils &s;ome years ago, revolting, and &s;eparating them&s;elves from the others, there remain only at this time eleven. Tho&s;e I met here are termed the River Bands; becau&s;e they chiefly dwell near the banks of this River: the other eight are generally di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title, Naudo|we&s;&s;ies of the Plains, and inhabit a country that lies, more to the we&s;tward. The names of the former are the Nehogatawonahs, the Mawtawbauntowahs, and the Shah&s;weentowahs, and con&s;i&s;t of about four hundred warriors.</P>
<P>A little before I met with the&s;e three bands, I fell in with a party of the Mawtawbauntowahs, amounting to forty warriors and their families. With the&s;e I re&s;ided a day or two, during which time five or &s;ix of their num|ber who had been out on an excur&s;ion, returned in great ha&s;te, and acquainted their companions that a large par|ty of the Chip&eacute;way warriors, "enough," as they ex|pre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, "to &s;wallow them all up," were clo&s;e at their heels, and on the point of attacking their little camp. The chiefs applied to me, and de&s;ired I would put my&s;elf at their head, and lead them out to oppo&s;e their enemies. As I was a &s;tranger, and unwilling to excite the anger of either nation, I knew not how to act; and neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> found my&s;elf in a greater dilemma. Had I re|fu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Naudowe&s;&s;ies I &s;hould have drawn on
<PB N="31" REF="021728_0045_0FB538029A2A9FA8">
my&s;elf their di&s;plea&s;ure, or had I met the Chip&eacute;ways with ho&s;tile intentions, I &s;hould have made that people my foes, and had I been fortunate enough to have e&s;cap|ed their arrows at this time, on &s;ome future occa&s;ion &s;hould probably have experienced the &s;everity of their revenge. In this extremity I cho&s;e the middle cour&s;e, and de&s;ired that the Naudowe&s;&s;ies would &s;uffer me to meet them, that I might endeavor to avert their fury. To this they reluctantly a&s;&s;ented, being per&s;uaded, from the inveteracy which had long prevailed between them, that my remon&s;trances would be in vain.</P>
<P>Taking my Frenchman with me, who could &s;peak their language, I ha&s;tened towards the place where the Chip&eacute;ways were &s;uppo&s;ed to be. The Naudowe&s;&s;ies du|ring this, kept at a di&s;tance behind. As I approached them with the pipe of peace, a &s;mall party of their chiefs, con&s;i&s;ting of about eight or ten, came in a friendly man|ner towards me; with whom, by the means of my inter|preter, I held a long conver&s;ation; the re&s;ult of which was, that their rancor being by my per&s;ua&s;ions in &s;ome mea&s;ure mollified, they agreed to return back, without accompli&s;hing their &s;avage purpo&s;es. During our di&s;|cour&s;e I could perceive, as they lay &s;cattered about, that the party was very numerous, and many of them armed with mu&s;kets.</P>
<P>Having happily &s;ucceeded in my undertaking, I re|turned without delay to the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, and de&s;ired they would in&s;tantly remove their camp to &s;ome other part of the country, le&s;t their enemies &s;hould repent of the promi&s;e they had given, and put their intentions in execution. They accordingly followed my advice, and immediately prepared to &s;trike their tents. Whil&s;t they were doing this, they loaded me with thanks; and when I had &s;een them on board their canoes, I pur&s;ued my route.</P>
<P>To this adventure I was chiefly indebted for the friend|ly reception I afterwards met with from the Naudowe&s;&s;ies of the Plains, and for the re&s;pect and honors I received during my abode among them. And when I arrived many months after at the Chip&eacute;way village, near the Ottowaw lakes, I found that my fame had reached that
<PB N="32" REF="021728_0046_0FB53805091633D0">
place before me. The chiefs received me with great cordiality, and the elder part of them thanked me for the mi&s;chief I had prevented. They informed me, that the war between their nation and the Naudowe&s;&s;ies had continued without interruption for more that forty win|ters. That they had long wi&s;hed to put an end to it, but this was generally prevented by the young warriors of either nation, who could not re&s;train their ardor when they met. They &s;aid, they &s;hould be happy if &s;ome chief of the &s;ame pacific di&s;po&s;ition as my&s;elf, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an equal degree of re&s;olution and coolne&s;s, would &s;ettle in the country between the two nations; for by the interference of &s;uch a per&s;on, an accomodation, which on their parts they &s;incerely de&s;ired, might be brought about. As I did not meet any of the Naudo|we&s;&s;ies afterwards, I had not an opportunity of forward|ing &s;o good a work.</P>
<P>About thirty miles below the Falls of St. Anthony, at which I arrived the tenth day after I left Lake Pepin, is a remarkable cave of an amazing depth. The Indians term it Wakon-teebe, that is, the Dwelling of the Great Spirit. The entrance into it is about ten feet wide, the height of it five feet. The arch within is near fifteen feet high and about thirty feet broad. The bottom of it con&s;i&s;ts of fine clear &s;and. About twenty feet from the entrance begins a lake, the water of which is tran&s;pa|rent, and extends to an un&s;earchable di&s;tance; for the darkne&s;s of the cave prevents all attempts to acquire a knowledge of it. I threw a &s;mall pebble towards the interior parts of it, with my utmo&s;t &s;trength: I could hear that it fell into the water, and notwith&s;tanding it was of &s;o &s;mall a &s;ize, it cau&s;ed an a&s;toni&s;hing and horri|ble noi&s;e, that reverberated through all tho&s;e gloomy re|gions. I found in this cave many Indian hieroglyphics, which appeared very ancient, for time had nearly cover|ed them with mo&s;s, &s;o that it was with difficulty I could tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them. They were cut in a rude manner, upon the in&s;ide of the walls, which were compo&s;ed of a &s;tone &s;o extremely &s;oft that it might ea&s;ily be penetrated with a knife: a &s;tone every where to be found near the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi.

The cave is only acce&s;&s;ible by a&s;cending a nar|row, &s;teep pa&s;&s;age, that lies near the brink of the river.</P>
<P>At a little di&s;tance from this dreary cavern, is the bu|rying-place of &s;everal bands of the Naudowe&s;&s;ie Indians: though the&s;e people have no fixed re&s;idence, living in tents, and abiding but a few months on one &s;pot, yet they always bring the bones of their dead to this place; which they take the opportunity of doing when the chiefs meet to hold their councils, and to &s;ettle all pub|lic affairs for the en&s;uing &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Ten miles below the Falls of St. Anthony, the River St. Pierre, called by the natives the Waddapawmene&s;o|tor, falls into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi from the we&s;t. It is not mentioned by Father Hennipin, although a large, fair river: this omi&s;&s;ion I conclude, mu&s;t have proceeded from a &s;mall i&s;land that is &s;ituated exactly at its entrance, by which the &s;ight of it is intercepted. I &s;hould not have di&s;covered this river my&s;elf, had I not taken a view, when I was &s;earching for it, from the high lands oppo&s;ite, which ri&s;e to a great height.</P>
<P>Nearly over again&s;t this river I was obliged to leave my canoe, on account of the ice, and travel by land to the Falls of St. Anthony, where I arrived on the 17th of November. The Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi from the St. Pierre to this place, is rather more rapid than I had hitherto found it, and without i&s;lands of any con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Before I left my canoe I overtook a young prince of the Winnebago Indians, who was going on an emba&s;&s;y to &s;ome of the bands of the Naudowe&s;&s;ies. Finding that I intended to take a view of the Falls, he agreed to accompany me, his curio&s;ity having been often excited by the accounts he had received from &s;ome of his chiefs: he accordingly left his family (for the Indians never tra|vel without their hou&s;holds) at this place, under the care of my Mohawk &s;ervant, and we proceeded together by land, attended only by my Frenchmen, to this celebrated place.</P>
<P>We could di&s;tinctly hear the noi&s;e of the water full fifteen miles before we reached the falls; and I was great|ly plea&s;ed and &s;urpri&s;ed, when I approached this a&s;toni&s;h|ing work of nature: but I was not long at liberty to
<PB N="34" REF="021728_0048_0FB5380D53242D50">
indulge the&s;e emotions, my attention being called off by the behavior of my companion.</P>
<P>The prince had no &s;ooner gained the point that over|looks this wonderful ca&s;cade, than he began with an audible voice to addre&s;s the Great Spirit, one of who&s;e places of re&s;idence he imagined this to be. He told him that he had come a long way to pay his adorations to him, and now would make him the be&s;t offerings in his power. He accordingly fir&s;t threw his pipe into the &s;tream; then the roll that contained his tobacco; after the&s;e, the bracelets he wore on his arms and wri&s;ts; next an ornament that encircled his neck, compo&s;ed of beads and wires; and at la&s;t the ear-rings from his ears; in &s;hort, he pre&s;ented to his god, every part of his dre&s;s that was valuable: during this he frequently &s;mote his brea&s;t with great violence, threw his arms about, and appeared to be much agitated.</P>
<P>All this while he continued his adorations, and at length concluded them with fervent petitions that the Great Spirit would con&s;tantly afford us his protection on our travels, giving us a bright &s;un, a blue &s;ky, and clear, untroubled waters: nor would he leave the place till we had &s;moked together with my pipe, in honor of the Great Spirit.</P>
<P>I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at beholding an in&s;tance of &s;uch elevated devotion in &s;o young an Indian, and in&s;tead of ridiculing the ceremonies attending it, as I ob&s;erved my catholic &s;ervant tacitly did, I looked on the prince with a greater degree of re&s;pect for the&s;e &s;incere proofs he gave of his piety; and I doubt not but that his offer|ings and prayers were as acceptable to the univer&s;al Parent of mankind, as if they had been made with great|er pomp, or in a con&s;ecrated place.</P>
<P>Indeed, the whole conduct of this young prince, at once amazed and charmed me. During the few days we were together, his attention &s;eemed totally to be em|ployed in yielding me every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power; and even in &s;o &s;hort a time, he gave me innumerable proofs of the mo&s;t generous and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip; &s;o that on our return I parted from him with great re|luctance. Whil&s;t I beheld the artle&s;s, yet engaging man|ners
<PB N="35" REF="021728_0049_0FB5380F594792A8">
of this unpoli&s;hed &s;avage, I could not help drawing a compari&s;on between him and &s;ome of the more re|fined inhabitants of civilized countries, not much, I own, in favor of the latter.</P>
<P>The Falls of St. Anthony received their name from Father Louis Hennipin, a French mi&s;&s;ionary, who travel|led into the&s;e parts about the year 1680, and was the fir&s;t European ever &s;een by the natives. This amazing body of waters, which are above 250 yards over, form a mo&s;t plea&s;ing cataract; they fall perpendicularly about thirty feet, and the rapids below, in the &s;pace of 300 yards more, render the de&s;cent con&s;iderably greater; &s;o that when viewed at a di&s;tance, they appear to be much higher than they really are. The above-mentioned tra|veller has laid them down at above &s;ixty feet; but he has made a greater error in calculating the height of the Falls of Niagara; which he a&s;&s;erts to be 600 feet; whereas from later ob&s;ervations accurately made, it is well known that it does not exceed 140 feet. But the good father I fear too often had no other foundation for his accounts, than report, or, at be&s;t, a &s;light in|&s;pection.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Falls &s;tands a &s;mall i&s;land, about forty feet broad and &s;omewhat longer, on which grow a few cragged hemlock and &s;pruce trees; and about half way between this i&s;land and the ea&s;tern &s;hore is a rock, lying at the very edge of the Fall, in an oblique po&s;ition, that appeared to be about five or &s;ix feet broad, and thirty or forty long. The&s;e Falls vary much from all the others I have &s;een, as you may approach clo&s;e to them without finding the lea&s;t ob&s;truction from any interven|ing hill or precipice.</P>
<P>The country around them is extremely beautiful. It is not an uninterrupted plain, where the eye finds no re|lief, but compo&s;ed of many gentle a&s;cents, which in the &s;ummer are covered with the fine&s;t verdure, and inter|&s;per&s;ed with little groves, that give a plea&s;ing variety to the pro&s;pect. On the whole, when the Falls are in|cluded, which may be &s;een at the di&s;tance of four miles, a more plea&s;ing and picture&s;que view cannot, I believe, be found throughout the univer&s;e. I could have wi&s;hed
<PB N="36" REF="021728_0050_0FB53810D9146130">
that I had happened to enjoy this glorious &s;ight at a more &s;ea&s;onable time of the year, whil&s;t the trees and hillocks were clad in nature's gaye&s;t livery, as this mu&s;t have greatly added to the plea&s;ure I received; however, even then it exceeded my warme&s;t expectations. I have endeavored to give the reader as ju&s;t an idea of this enchanting &s;pot, as po&s;&s;ible; but all de&s;cription, whe|ther of the pencil or the pen, mu&s;t fall infinitely &s;hort of the original.</P>
<P>At a little di&s;tance below the Falls &s;tands a &s;mall i&s;land, of about an acre and an half, on which grow a great number of oak trees, every branch of which, able to &s;upport the weight, was full of eagles ne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s The rea&s;on that this kind of birds re&s;ort in &s;uch numbers to this &s;pot, is, that they are here &s;ecure from the attacks either of man or bea&s;t, their retreat being guarded by the rapids, which the Indians never attempt to pa&s;s. Another rea&s;on is, that they find a con&s;tant &s;upply of food for them&s;elves and their young, from the animals and fi&s;h which are da&s;hed to pieces by the Falls, and driven on the adjacent &s;hore.</P>
<P>Having &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity, as far as the eye of man can be &s;atisfied, I proceeded on, &s;till accompanied by my young friend, till I had reached the River St. Fran|cis, near &s;ixty miles above the Falls. To this river Fa|ther Hennipin gave the name of St. Francis, and this was the extent of his travels, as well as mine, towards the north-we&s;t. As the &s;ea&s;on was &s;o advanced, and the weather extremely cold, I was not able to make &s;o many ob&s;ervations on the&s;e parts as I otherwi&s;e &s;hould have done.</P>
<P>It might however, perhaps, be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that in the little tour I made about the Falls, after tra|velling fourteen miles, by the &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, I came to a river nearly twenty yards wide, which ran from the north-ea&s;t, called Rum River. And on the 20th of November came to another termed Goo&s;e River, about twelve yards wide. On the 21&s;t I arrived at the St. Francis, which is about thirty yards wide. Here the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi it&s;elf grows narrow, being not more than nine|ty
<PB N="37" REF="021728_0051_0FB538125A3DAE90">
yards over; and appears to be chiefly compo&s;ed of &s;mall branches. The ice prevented me from noticing the depth of any of the&s;e three rivers.</P>
<P>The country in &s;ome places is hilly, but without large mountains; and the land is tolerably good. I ob&s;erved here many deer and carriboos, &s;ome elk, with abundance of beavers, otters, and other furs. A little above this, to the north-ea&s;t, are a number of &s;mall lakes called the Thou&s;and Lakes; the parts about which, though but little frequented, are the be&s;t within many miles, for hunting, as the hunter never fails of returning loaded be|yond his expectations.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi has never been explored higher up than the River St. Francis, and only by Father Hennipin and my&s;elf thus far. So that we are obliged &s;olely to the Indians, for all the intelligence we are able to give rela|tive to the more northern parts. As this River is not navigable from the &s;ea for ve&s;&s;els of any con&s;iderable bur|then, much higher up than the Forks of the Ohio, and even that is accompli&s;hed with great difficulty, owing to the rapidity of the current, and the windings of the ri|ver; tho&s;e &s;ettlements that may be made on the interior branches of it, mu&s;t be indi&s;putably &s;ecure from the at|tacks of any maritime power. But at the &s;ame time the &s;ettlers will have the advantage of being able to convey their produce to the &s;ea-ports, with great facility, the current of the river from its &s;ource to its entrance into the Gulf of Mexico, being extremely favorable for doing this in &s;mall craft. This might al&s;o in time be facili|tated by canals or &s;horter cuts; and a communication opened by water with New-York, Canada, &amp;c. by way of the lakes. The Forks of the Ohio are about nine hundred miles from the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, fol|lowing the cour&s;e of the river; and the Me&s;&s;orie two hundred miles above the&s;e. From the latter it is about twenty miles to the Illinois River, and from that to the Oui&s;con&s;in, which I have given an account of, about eight hundred more.</P>
<P>On the 25th I returned to my canoe, which I had left at the mouth of the River St. Pierre; and here I part|ed with regret from my young friend, the prince of the
<PB N="38" REF="021728_0052_0FB53813DAB77E28">
Winnebagoes. This river being clear of ice, by rea&s;on of its &s;outhern &s;ituation, I found nothing to ob&s;truct my pa&s;&s;age. On the 28th, being advanced about forty miles, I arrived at a &s;mall branch that fell into it from the north; to which, as it had no name that I could di&s;tingui&s;h it by, I gave my own. About forty miles higher up I came to the Forks of Verd and Red Marble Rivers, which join at &s;ome little di&s;tance before they enter the St. Pierre.</P>
<P>The River St. Pierre, at its junction with the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ip|pi, is about a hundred yards broad, and continues that breadth nearly all the way I &s;ailed upon it. It has a great depth of water, and in &s;ome places runs very bri&s;k|ly. About fifty miles from its mouth are &s;ome rapids, and much higher up there are many others.</P>
<P>I proceeded up this river about two hundred miles to the country of the Naudowe&s;&s;ies of the Plains, which lies a little above the Forks formed by the Verd and Red Marble Rivers, ju&s;t mentioned, where a branch from the &s;outh nearly joins the Me&s;&s;orie River. By the accounts I received from the Indians, I have rea&s;on to believe that the River St. Pierre and the Me&s;&s;orie, though they enter the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi twelve hundred miles from each other, take their ri&s;e in the &s;ame neighborhood; and this within the &s;pace of a mile.</P>
<P>The River St. Pierre's northern branch ri&s;es from a number of lakes near the &s;hining mountains; and it is from &s;ome of the&s;e, al&s;o, that a capital branch of the River Bourbon, which runs into Hud&s;on's Bay, has its &s;ources.</P>
<P>From the intelligence I gained from the Naudowe&s;&s;ie Indians, among whom I arrived on the 7th of Decem|ber, and who&s;e language I perfectly acquired during a re&s;idence of five months; and al&s;o from the accounts I afterwards obtained from the A&s;&s;inipoils, who &s;peak the &s;ame tongue, being a revolted band of the Naudowe&s;&s;ies and from the Killi&s;tinoes, neighbors of the A&s;&s;inipo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who &s;peak the Chip&eacute;way language, and inhabit the he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the River Bourbon; I &s;ay from the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> toge|ther with my own ob&s;ervations, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that the four mo&s;t capital rivers on the Conti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> North

America, viz. the St. Lawrence, the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, the river Bourbon, and the Oregon or the river of the We&s;t (as I hinted in my Introduction) have their &s;ources in the &s;ame neighborhood. The waters of the three former are within thirty miles of each other; the latter, how|ever, is rather further we&s;t.</P>
<P>This &s;hews that the&s;e parts are the highe&s;t lands in North-America; and it is an in&s;tance not to be parallel|ed on the other three quarters of the globe, that four rivers of &s;uch magnitude &s;hould take their ri&s;e together, and each, after running &s;eparate cour&s;es, di&s;charge their waters into different oceans at the di&s;tance of two thou|&s;and miles from their &s;ources. For in their pa&s;&s;age from this &s;pot to the bay of St. Lawrence, ea&s;t, to the Bay of Mexico, &s;outh, to Hud&s;on's Bay, north, and to the bay at the Straits of Annian, we&s;t, each of the&s;e traver&s;e upwards of two thou&s;and miles.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here give my readers &s;uch reflections as occur|red to me, when I had received this intere&s;ting informa|tion, and had by numberle&s;s enquiries, a&s;certained the truth of it; that is, as far as it was po&s;&s;ible to arrive at a certainty without a per&s;onal inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>It is well known that the Colonies, particularly tho&s;e of New-England and Canada, are greatly affected, about the time their winter &s;ets in, by a north-we&s;t wind, which continues for &s;everal months, and renders the cold much more inten&s;e there than it is in the interior parts of America. This I can, from my own knowledge, a&s;&s;ert, as I found the winter, that I pa&s;&s;ed to the we&s;tward of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, far from &s;evere; and the north-we&s;t wind blowing on tho&s;e countries con&s;iderably more temperate than I have often experienced it to be nearer the coa&s;t. And that this did not ari&s;e from an uncertainty of the &s;ea&s;ons, but was annually the ca&s;e, I conclude, both from the &s;mall quantity of &s;now that then fell, and a total di&s;u&s;e of &s;now &s;hoes by the&s;e Indians, without which none of the more ea&s;tern nations can po&s;&s;ibly travel du|ring the winter.</P>
<P>As naturali&s;ts ob&s;erve, that air re&s;embles water in ma|ny re&s;pects, particularly by often flowing in a compact body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that this is generally remarked to be with
<PB N="40" REF="021728_0054_0FB5381F01597D50">
the current of large &s;treams, and &s;eldom acro&s;s them, may not the winds that &s;et violently into the Bay of Mexico about the latter end of the year, take their cour&s;e over the continent in the &s;ame direction as the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi does; till meeting the north winds (that from a &s;imilar cau&s;e blow up the Bourbon from Hud&s;on's Bay) they are forced acro&s;s the great lakes, down the current of the waters of the St. Lawrence, and united, commit tho&s;e ravages, and occa&s;ion tho&s;e &s;evere winters, expe|rienced in the before-mentioned countries? During their progre&s;s over the lakes they become expanded, and con|&s;equently affect a greater tract of land than they other|wi&s;e would do.</P>
<P>According to my &s;canty knowledge of natural philo|&s;ophy, this does not appear improbable. Whether it is agreeable to the laws e&s;tabli&s;hed by naturali&s;ts to ac|count for the operations of that element, I know not. However, the de&s;cription here given of the &s;ituation of the&s;e va&s;t bodies of water, and their near approach to each other, with my own undige&s;ted &s;uppo&s;itions of their effect on the winds, may prove perhaps, in abler hands, the means of leading to many u&s;eful di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>On the 7th of December, I arrived (as I &s;aid before) at the utmo&s;t extent of my travels towards the we&s;t; where I met with a large party of the Naudowe&s;&s;ie In|dians, among whom I re&s;ided &s;even months. The&s;e con|&s;tituted a part of the eight bands of the Naudowe&s;&s;ie of the Plains; and are termed the Wawpeentowahs, the Tintons, the Afrahcootans, the Mawhaws, and the Schi|ans. The other three bands, who&s;e names are, the Schi|ane&s;e, the Chongou&s;ceton, and the Waddapawje&s;tin, dwell higher up, to the we&s;t of the River St. Pierre, on plains that, according to their account, are unbound|ed; and probably terminate on the coa&s;t of the Pacific Ocean. The Naudowe&s;&s;ie nation, when united, con&s;i&s;ts of more than two thou&s;and warriors. The A&s;&s;inipoil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; who revolted from them, amount to about three hun|dred; and leagued with the Killi&s;tinoes, live in a conti|nual &s;tate of enmity with the other eleven bands.</P>
<P>As I proceeded up the River St. Pierre, and had near|ly reached the place where the&s;e people were encamped,
<PB N="41" REF="021728_0055_0FB53821585FD670">
I ob&s;erved two or three canoes coming down the &s;tream; but no &s;ooner had the Indians that were on board them, di&s;covered us, than they rowed toward the land, and leaping a&s;hore with precipitation, left their canoes to float as the current drove them. In a few minutes I perceived &s;ome others; who, as &s;oon as they came in &s;ight, followed, with equal &s;peed, the example of their countrymen.</P>
<P>I now thought it nece&s;&s;ary to proceed with caution; and therefore kept on the &s;ide of the river oppo&s;ite to that on which the Indians had landed. However, I &s;till continued my cour&s;e, &s;atisfied that the pipe of peace, which was fixed at the head of my canoe, and the Engli&s;h colors that were flying at the &s;tern, would prove my &s;ecurity. After rowing about half a mile further, in turning a point, I di&s;covered a great number of tents, and more than a thou&s;and Indians, at a little di&s;tance from the &s;hore. Being now nearly oppo&s;ite to them, I ordered my men to pull directly over, as I was willing to convince the Indians by &s;uch a &s;tep, that I placed &s;ome confidence in them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had reached the land, two of the chiefs pre&s;ented their hands to me, and led me, amid&s;t the a&s;toni&s;hed multitude, who had mo&s;t of them never &s;een a white man before, to a tent. Into this we entered, and according to the cu&s;tom that univer&s;ally prevails among every Indian nation, began to &s;moke the pipe of peace. We had not &s;at long before the crowd became &s;o great, both around, and upon the tent, that we were in danger of being cru&s;hed by its fall. On this we re|turned to the plain, where, having gratified the curio&s;ity of the common people, their wonder abated, and ever after they treated me with great re&s;pect.</P>
<P>From the chiefs I met with the mo&s;t friendly and ho&s;|pitable reception; which induced me, as the &s;ea&s;on was &s;o far advanced, to take up my re&s;idence among them during the winter. To render my &s;tay as comfortable as po&s;&s;ible, I fir&s;t endeavored to learn their language. This I &s;oon did, &s;o as to make my&s;elf perfectly intel|ligible, having before acquired &s;ome &s;light knowledge of the language of tho&s;e Indians that live on the back of
<PB N="42" REF="021728_0056_0FB538239A8D5D00">
the &s;ettlements; and in con&s;equence met with every ac|commodation their manner of living would afford. Nor did I want for &s;uch amu&s;ements as tended to make &s;o long a period pa&s;s cheerfully away. I frequently hunted with them; and at other times beheld with plea&s;ure their re|creations and pa&s;times, which I &s;hall de&s;cribe hereafter.</P>
<P>Sometimes I &s;at with the chiefs, and whil&s;t we &s;moked the friendly pipe, entertained them, in return for the accounts they gave me of their wars and excur&s;ions, with a narrative of my own adventures, and a de&s;cription of all the battles fought between the Engli&s;h and French in America, in many of which I had a per&s;onal &s;hare. They always paid great attention to my details, and a&s;ked many pertinent que&s;tions relative to the European methods of making war.</P>
<P>I held the&s;e conver&s;ations with them in a great mea|&s;ure to procure from them &s;ome information relative to the chief point I had con&s;tantly in view, that of gaining a knowledge of the &s;ituation and produce, both of their own country, and tho&s;e that lay to the we&s;tward of them. Nor was I di&s;appointed in my de&s;igns; for I procured from them much u&s;eful intelligence. They likewi&s;e drew for me plans of all the countries with which they were acquainted; but as I entertained no great opinion of their geographical knowledge, I placed not much de|pendence on them, and therefore think it unnece&s;&s;ary to give them to the public. They draw with a piece of burnt coal, taken from the hearth, upon the in&s;ide bark of the birch tree; which is as &s;mooth as paper, and an|&s;wers the &s;ame purpo&s;es, notwith&s;tanding it is of a yellow ca&s;t. Their &s;ketches are made in a rude manner, but they &s;eem to give us as ju&s;t an idea of a country, al|though the plan is not &s;o exact, as more experienced draught&s;men could do.</P>
<P>I left the habitations of the&s;e ho&s;pitable Indians the latter end of April 1767; but did not part from them for &s;everal days, as I was accompanied on my journey by near three hundred of them, among whom were many chiefs, to the mouth of the River St. Pierre. At this &s;ea&s;on, the&s;e bands annually go to the Great Cave, be|fore mentioned, to hold a grand council with all the other
<PB N="43" REF="021728_0057_0FB5382519EF6398">
bands; wherein their &s;ettle their operations for the en&s;u|ing year. At the &s;ame time they carry with them their dead, for interment, bound up in buffaloes &s;kins. Be|&s;ides tho&s;e that accompanied me, others were gone be|fore, and the re&s;t were to follow.</P>
<P>Never did I travel with &s;o cheerful and happy a com|pany. But their mirth met with a &s;udden and tempora|ry allay from a violent &s;torm that overtook us one da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on our pa&s;&s;age. We had ju&s;t landed, and were preparing to &s;et up our tents for the night, when a heavy cloud over&s;pread the heavens, and the mo&s;t dreadful thunder, lightning, and rain, i&s;&s;ued from it, that ever I beheld.</P>
<P>The Indians were greatly terrified, and ran to &s;uch &s;helter as they could find; for only a few tents were as yet erected. Apprehen&s;ive of the danger that might en&s;ue from &s;tanding near any thing which could &s;erve for a conductor, as the cloud appeared to contain &s;uch an uncommon quantity of electrical fluid, I took my &s;tand as far as po&s;&s;ible from any covering; chu&s;ing rather to be expo&s;ed to the peltings of the &s;torm, than to receive a fatal &s;troke. At this the Indians were greatly &s;ur|pri&s;ed, and drew conclu&s;ions from it not unfavorable to the opinion they already entertained of my re&s;olution. Yet I acknowledge that I was never more affected in my life; for nothing &s;carcely could exceed the terrific &s;cene. The peals of thunder were &s;o loud that they &s;hook the earth; and the lighting fla&s;hed along the ground in &s;treams of &s;ulphur; &s;o that the Indian chiefs them&s;elves, although their courage in war is u&s;ually in|vincible, could not help trembling at the horrid combu&s;|tion. As &s;oon as the &s;torm was over, they flocked around me, and informed me, that it was a proof of the anger of the evil &s;pirits, whom they were appre|hen&s;ive that they had highly offended.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the Great Cave, and the Indians had depo&s;ited the remains of their decea&s;ed friends in the burial-place that &s;tands adjacent to it, they held their great council, into which I was admitted, and at the &s;ame time had the honor to be in&s;talled or adopted a chief of their bands. On this occa&s;ion I made the fol|lowing &s;peech, which I in&s;ert, to give my readers a &s;pe|cimen
<PB N="44" REF="021728_0058_0FB5382946F9D3E0">
of the language and manner in which it is nece&s;&s;a|ry to addre&s;s the Indians, &s;o as to engage their attention, and to render the &s;peaker's expre&s;&s;ions con&s;onant to their ideas. It was delivered on the fir&s;t day of May 1767.</P>
<Q><P>My brothers, chiefs of the numerous and powerful Naudowe&s;&s;ies! I rejoice that through my long abode with you, I can now &s;peak to you (though after an imperfect manner) in your own tongue, like one of your own children. I rejoice al&s;o that I have had an opportunity &s;o frequently to inform you of the glo|ry and power of the Great King that reigns over the Engli&s;h and other nations; who is de&s;cended from a very ancient race of &s;overeigns, as old as the earth and waters; who&s;e feet &s;tand on two great i&s;lands, larger than any you have ever &s;een, amid&s;t the greate&s;t waters in the world; who&s;e head reaches to the &s;un, and who&s;e arms encircle the whole earth. The num|ber of who&s;e warriors are equal to the trees in the vallies, the &s;talks of rice in yonder mar&s;hes, or the blades of gra&s;s on your great plains. Who has hun|dreds of canoes of his own, of &s;uch amazing bigne&s;s, that all the waters in your country would not &s;uffice for one of them to &s;wim in; each of which have guns, not &s;mall like mine, which you &s;ee before you, but of &s;uch magnitude, that an hundred of your &s;toute&s;t young may would with difficulty be able to carry one. And the&s;e are equally &s;urpri&s;ing in their operation again&s;t the great king's enemies when en|gaged in battle; the terror they carry with them, your language wants words to expre&s;s. You may remember the other day when we were encamping, at Wadaw|pawmene&s;otor, the black clouds, the wind, the fire, the &s;tupendous noi&s;e, the horrible cracks, and the trem|bling of the earth, which then alarmed you, and gave you rea&s;on to think your gods were angry with you; not unlike the&s;e are the warlike implements of the Engli&s;h, when they are fighting the battles of their great king.</P>
<P>Several of the chiefs of your bands have often told me, in times pa&s;t, when I dwelt with you in your
<PB N="45" REF="021728_0059_0FB5382B1FCF3040">
tents, that they much wi&s;hed to be counted among the children and allies of the great king my ma&s;ter. You may remember how often you have de&s;ired me, when I return again to my own country, to acquaint the great king of your good di&s;po&s;ition towards him and his &s;ubjects, and that you wi&s;hed for traders from the Engli&s;h to come among you.</P>
<P>Being now about to take my leave of you, and to return to my own country, a long way towards the ri&s;ing &s;un, I again a&s;k you to tell me whether you con|tinue of the &s;ame mind as when I &s;poke to you in council la&s;t winter; and as there are now &s;everal of your chiefs here, who came from the great plains towards the &s;etting of the &s;un, whom I have never &s;poke with in council before, I a&s;k you to let me know if you are all willing to acknowledge your&s;elves the children of my great ma&s;ter the King of the Engli&s;h and other nations, as I &s;hall take the fir&s;t opportunity to acquaint him of your de&s;ires and good intentions.</P>
<P>I charge you not to give heed to bad reports; for there are wicked birds flying about among the neigh|boring nations, who may whi&s;per evil things in your ears again&s;t the Engli&s;h, contrary to what I have told you; you mu&s;t not believe them, for I have told you the truth.</P>
<P>And as for the chiefs that are about to go Michilli|mackinac, I &s;hall take care t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake for them and their &s;uit, a &s;traight road, &s;m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> waters, and a clear &s;ky; that they may go there, and &s;moke the pipe of peace, and re&s;t; &s;ecure on a beaver blanket under the &s;hade of the great tree of peace. Farewell!</P></Q>
<P>To this &s;peech I received the following an&s;wer, from the mouth of the principal chief:</P>
<Q><P>Good brother! I am now about to &s;peak to you with the mouths of the&s;e my brothers, chiefs of the eight bands of the powerful nation of the Naudowe&s;&s;ies. We believe and are well &s;atisfied in the truth of every thing you have told us about your great nation, and the great king our greate&s;t father; for whom we &s;pread this beaver blanket, that his fatherly protecti|on may ever re&s;t ea&s;y and &s;afe among&s;t us his children:
<PB N="46" REF="021728_0060_0FB5382DA01AD388">
your colors and your arms agree with the accounts you have given us about your great nation. We de|&s;ire that when you return, you will acquaint the great king how much the Naudowe&s;&s;ies wi&s;h to be counted among his good children.</P>
<P>You may believe us when we tell you that we will not open our ears to any who may dare to &s;peak evil of our great father the king of the Engli&s;h and other nations.</P>
<P>We thank you for what you have done for us in making peace between the Naudowe&s;&s;ies and the Chip&eacute;ways, and hope when you return to us again, that you will complete this good work; and quite di&s;pelling the clouds that intervene, open the blue &s;ky of peace, and cau&s;e the bloody hatchet to be deep bu|ried under the roots of the great tree of peace.</P>
<P>We wi&s;h you to remember to repre&s;ent to our great father, how much we de&s;ire that traders may be &s;ent to abide among us, with &s;uch things as we need, that the hearts of our young men, our wives, and chil|dren may be made glad. And may peace &s;ub&s;i&s;t be|tween us, &s;o long as the &s;un, the moon, the earth, and the waters &s;hall endure. Farewell!</P></Q>
<P>I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to caution the Indians again&s;t giving heed to any bad reports that may reach them from the neighboring nations, to the di&s;advantage of the Engli&s;h, as I had heard, at different places through which I pa&s;&s;ed, that emi&s;&s;aries were &s;till employed by the French to detach tho&s;e who were friendly to the Engli&s;h, from their intere&s;t. And I &s;aw, my&s;elf, &s;eve|ral belts of Wampum that had been delivered for this purpo&s;e to &s;ome of the tribes I was among. On the delivery of each of the&s;e, a Talk was held, wherein the Indians were told that the Engli&s;h, who were but a pet|ty people, had &s;tolen that country from their great fa|ther the king of France, whil&s;t he was a&s;leep; but that he would &s;oon awake, and take them again under his protection. The&s;e I found were &s;ent from Canada, by per&s;ons who appeared to be well affected towards the go|vernment under which they lived.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="021728_0061_0FB5382EDACED6B8">Whil&s;t I tarried at the mouth of the River St. Pierre, with the&s;e friendly Indians, I endeavored to gain intelli|gence whether any goods had been &s;ent towards the Falls of St. Anthony for my u&s;e, agreeable to the promi&s;e I had received from the governor when I left Michilli|mackinac. But finding from &s;ome Indians, who pa&s;&s;ed by in their return from tho&s;e parts, that this agreement had not been fulfilled, I was obliged to give up all thoughts of proceeding further to the north-we&s;t by this route, according to my original plan. I therefore re|turned to La Prairie le Chien, where I procured as ma|ny goods from the traders I left there the preceding year, as they could &s;pare.</P>
<P>As the&s;e, however, were not &s;ufficient to enable me to renew my fir&s;t de&s;ign, I determined to endeavor to make my way acro&s;s the country of the Chip&eacute;ways to Lake Superior; in hopes of meeting at the Grand Port|age on the north &s;ide of it, the traders that annually go from Michillimackinac to the north-we&s;t; of whom I doubted not but that I &s;hould be able to procure goods enough to an&s;wer my purpo&s;e, and al&s;o to penetrate through tho&s;e more northern parts to the Straits of An|nian.</P>
<P>And I the more readily returned to La Prairie le Chien, as I could by that means the better fulfil the engagement I had made to the party of Naudowe&s;&s;ies mentioned at the conclu&s;ion of my &s;peech.</P>
<P>During my abode with this people, wi&s;hing to &s;e|cure them entirely in the intere&s;t of the Engli&s;h, I had advi&s;ed &s;ome of the chiefs to go to Michillimackinac, where they would have an opportunity of trading, and of hearing the accounts that I had entertained them with of my countrymen, confirmed. At the &s;ame time I had furni&s;hed them with a recommendation to the governor, and given them every direction nece&s;&s;ary for their voyage.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this, one of the principal chiefs, and twenty-five of an inferior rank, agreed to go the en&s;uing &s;ummer. This they took an opportunity of do|ing, when they came with the re&s;t of their band to at|tend the grand council at the mouth of the River St.
<PB N="48" REF="021728_0062_0FB5383310F11CC8">
Pierre. Being obliged, on account of the di&s;appoint|ment I had ju&s;t been informed of, to return &s;o far down the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, I could from thence the more ea&s;ily &s;et them on their journey.</P>
<P>As the intermediate parts of this river are much fre|quented by the Chip&eacute;ways, with whom the Naudowe&s;&s;ies are continually at war, they thought it more prudent, being but a &s;mall party, to take the advantage of the night, than to travel with me by day; accordingly no &s;ooner was the grand council broke up, than I took a friendly leave of the&s;e people, from whom I had received innumerable civilities, and pur&s;ued once more my voyage.</P>
<P>I reached the ea&s;tern &s;ide of Lake Pepin the &s;ame night, where I went a&s;hore and encamped as u&s;ual. The next morning, when I had proceeded &s;ome miles further, I perceived at a di&s;tance before me, a &s;moke, which denoted that &s;ome Indians were near; and in a &s;hort time di&s;covered ten or twelve tents, not far from the bank of the river. As I was apprehen&s;ive that this was a party of the Rovers I had before met with, I knew not what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue. My attendants per&s;uaded me to endeavor to pa&s;s by them on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the ri|ver; but as I had hitherto found that the be&s;t way to en&s;ure a friendly reception from the Indians, is to meet them boldly, and without &s;hewing any tokens of fear, I would by no means con&s;ent to their propo&s;al. In&s;tead of this I cro&s;&s;ed directly over, and landed in the mid&s;t of them, for by this time the greate&s;t part of them were &s;tanding on the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t I acco&s;ted were Chip&eacute;ways inhabiting near the Ottowaw Lakes; who received me with great cor|diality, and &s;hook me by the hand in token of friend|&s;hip. At &s;ome little di&s;tance behind the&s;e &s;tood a chief remarkably tall and well made, but of &s;o &s;tern an a&s;pect, that the mo&s;t undaunted per&s;on could not behold him without feeling &s;ome degree of terror. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;eemed to have pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of life, and by the mode in which he was painted and tatowed, I di&s;covered that he was of high rank. However, I approached him in a courteous manner, and expected to have met with the &s;ame reception I had done from the others; but to my
<PB N="49" REF="021728_0063_0FB538384850D478">
great &s;urpri&s;e, he withheld his hand, and looking fiercely at me, &s;aid, in the Chip&eacute;way tongue, <Q>Cawin ni&s;hi&s;hin &s;agano&s;h,</Q> that is, "The Engli&s;h are no good." As he had his tomahawk in his hand, I expected that this laconic &s;entence would have been followed by a blow; to prevent which, I drew a pi&s;tol from my belt, and, holding it in a carele&s;s po&s;ition, pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by him, to let him &s;ee I was not afraid of him.</P>
<P>I learned &s;oon after from the other Indians, that this was a chief, called by the French, the Grand Sautor, or the Great Chip&eacute;way Chief, for they denominate the Chip&eacute;ways, Sautors. They likewi&s;e told me that he had been always a &s;teady friend to that people, and when they delivered up Michillimackinac to the Engli&s;h on their evacuation of Canada, the Grand Sautor had &s;worn that he would ever remain the avowed enemy of its new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, as the territories on which the fort is built be|longed to him.</P>
<P>Finding him thus, di&s;po&s;ed, I took care to be con&s;tant|ly upon my guard whil&s;t I &s;taid; but that he might not &s;uppo&s;e I was driven away by his frowns, I took up my abode there for the night. I pitched my tent at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Indians, and had no &s;ooner laid my|&s;elf down to re&s;t, than I was awakened by my French &s;ervant. Having been alarmed by the &s;ound of Indian mu&s;ic, he had run to the out&s;ide of the tent, where he beheld a party of the young &s;avages dancing towards us in an extraordinary manner, each carrying in his hand a torch fixed on the top of a long pole. But I &s;hall defer any further account of this uncommon entertainment, which at once &s;urpri&s;ed and alarmed me, till I treat of the Indian dances.</P>
<P>The next morning I continued my voyage, and before night reached La Prairie le Chien; at which place the party of Naudowe&s;&s;ies &s;oon overtook me. Not long after, the Grand S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">or al&s;o arrived, and before the Naudo|we&s;&s;ies left tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> place to continue their journey to Michil|limackinac, he found means, in conjunction with &s;ome French traders from Loui&s;iana, to draw from me about ten of the Naudowe&s;&s;ie chiefs, whom he prevailed upon to go towards tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="021728_0064_0FB5383A5D65A668">The remainder proceeded, according to my directions, to the Engli&s;h fort; from whence I afterwards heard that they returned to their own country without any unfor|tunate accident befalling them, and greatly plea&s;ed with the reception they had met with. Whil&s;t not more than half of tho&s;e who went to the &s;outhward, through the difference of that &s;outhern climate from their own, lived to reach their abode. And &s;ince I came to England I have been informed, that the Grand Sautor having ren|dered him&s;elf more and more di&s;gu&s;tful to the Engli&s;h, by his inveterate enmity towards them, was at length &s;tab|bed in his tent, as he encamped near Michillimackinac, by a trader to whom I had related the foregoing &s;tory.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have remarked, that whatever Indians happen to meet at La Prairie le Chien, the great mart to which all who inhabit the adjacent countries re&s;ort, though the nations to which they belong are at war with each other, yet they are obliged to re&s;train their enmity, and to forbear all ho&s;tile acts during their &s;tay there. This re|gulation has been long e&s;tabli&s;hed among them for their mutual convenience, as without it no trade could be ear|ned on. The &s;ame rule is ob&s;erved al&s;o at the Red Mountain (afterwards de&s;cribed) from whence they get the &s;tone of which they make their pipes: the&s;e being indi&s;pen&s;able to the accommodation of every neighboring tribe, a &s;imilar re&s;triction becomes needful, and is of pub|lic utility.</P>
<P>The River St. Pierre, which runs through the territo|ries of the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, flows through a mo&s;t delightful country, abounding with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, that grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly; and with a little cultivation it might be made to produce even the luxuries of life. Wild rice grows here in great abundance; and every part is filled with trees bending under their loads of fruits, &s;uch as plums, grapes, and apples; the meadows are covered with hops, and many &s;orts of vegetables; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the ground is &s;tored with u&s;eful roots, with angelica, &s;pikenard, and ground-nuts as large as hens eggs. At a little di&s;tance from the &s;ides of the river are eminences, from which you have views that cannot be exceeded even by the mo&s;t beautiful of tho&s;e I have already de&s;cribed; amid&s;t the&s;e
<PB N="51" REF="021728_0065_0FB5383E989DECF8">
are delightful groves, and &s;uch amazing quantities of maples, that they would produce &s;ugar &s;ufficient for any number of inhabitants.</P>
<P>A little way from the mouth of this river, on the north &s;ide of it, &s;tands a hill, one part of which, that to|wards the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, is compo&s;ed entirely of white &s;tone, of the &s;ame &s;oft nature as that I have before de&s;cribed; for &s;uch, indeed, is all the &s;tone in this country. But what appears remarkable, is, that the color of it is as white as the driven &s;now. The outward part of it was crumbled by the wind and weather into heaps of &s;and, of which a beautiful compo&s;ition might be made; or, I am of opinion that, when properly treated, the &s;tone it|&s;elf would grow harder by time, and have a very noble effect in architecture.</P>
<P>Near that branch which is termed the Marble River, is a mountain, from whence the Indians get a &s;ort of red &s;tone, out of which they hew the bowls of their pipes. In &s;ome of the&s;e parts is found a black, hard clay, or ra|ther &s;tone, of which the Naudowe&s;&s;ies make their family uten&s;ils. This country likewi&s;e abounds with a milk|white clay, of which China ware might be made equal in goodne&s;s to the A&s;iatic; and al&s;o with a blue clay that &s;erves the Indians for paint, with this la&s;t they contrive, by mixing it with the red &s;tone powdered, to paint them|&s;elves of different colors. Tho&s;e that can get the blue clay here mentioned, paint them&s;elves very much with it; particularly when they are about to begin their &s;ports and pa&s;times. It is al&s;o e&s;teemed by them a mark of peace, as it has a re&s;emblance of a blue &s;ky, which with them is a &s;ymbol of it, and made u&s;e of in their &s;peeches as a figurative expre&s;&s;ion to denote peace. When they wi&s;h to &s;hew that their inclinations are pacific towards other tribes, they greatly ornament both them&s;elves and their belts with it.</P>
<P>Having concluded my bu&s;ine&s;s at La Prairie le Chien, I proceeded once more up the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, as far as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> where the Chip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">way River enters it a little below Lake Pepin. Here, having engaged an Indian pilot, I directed him to &s;teer towards the Ottawaw Lakes, which
<PB N="52" REF="021728_0066_0FB53840D907F198">
lie near the head of this river. This he did, and I ar|rived at them the beginning of July.</P>
<P>The Chip&eacute;way River, at its junction with the Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi, is about eighty yards wide, but is much wider as you advance into it. Near thirty miles up it &s;eparates into two branches, and I took my cour&s;e through that which lies to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>The country adjoining to the river, for about &s;ixty miles, is very level, and on its banks lie fine meadows, where larger droves of buffaloes and elks were feeding, than I had ob&s;erved in any other part of my travels. The track between the two branches of this river is termed the Road of War between the Chip&eacute;way and Naudowe&s;&s;ie Indians.</P>
<P>The country to the Falls is almo&s;t without any timber, and above that very uneven and rugged, and clo&s;ely wood|ed with pines, beach, maple, and birch. Here a mo&s;t remarkable and a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ight pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my view. In a wood, on the ea&s;t of the river, which was about three quarters of a mile in length, and in depth further than my eye could reach, I ob&s;erved that every tree, many of which were more than &s;ix feet in circum|ference, was lying flat on the ground, torn up by the roots. This appeared to have been done by &s;ome extra|ordinary hurricane, that came from the we&s;t &s;ome years ago; but how many I could not learn, as I found no in|habitants near it, of whom I could gain information. The country on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, from being le&s;s woody, had e&s;caped in a great mea&s;ure this havoc, as only a few trees were blown down.</P>
<P>Near the heads of this river, is a town of the Chip&eacute;|ways, from whence it takes its name. It is &s;ituated on each &s;ide of the river (which at this place is of no con&s;i|derable breadth) and lies adjacent to the banks of a &s;mall lake. This town contains about forty hou&s;es, and can &s;end out upwards of one hundred warriors, many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whom were fine, &s;tout young men. The hou&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> built after the Indian manner, and have neat plant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> behind them; but the inhabitants, in general<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eemed to be the na&s;tie&s;t people I had ever been among. I ob|&s;erved that the women and children indulged them&s;elves
<PB N="53" REF="021728_0067_0FB538425AF17600">
in a cu&s;tom, which though common, in &s;ome degree, throughout every Indian nation, appears to be, accord|ing to our ideas, of the mo&s;t nau&s;eous and indelicate na|ture; that of &s;earching each other's head, and eating the prey caught therein.</P>
<P>In July I left this town, and having cro&s;&s;ed a number of &s;mall lakes and carrying places that intervened, came to a head branch of the River St. Croix. This branch I de&s;cended to a fork, and then a&s;cended another to its &s;ource. On both the&s;e rivers I di&s;covered &s;everal mines of virgin copper, which was as pure as that found in any other country.</P>
<P>Here I came to a &s;mall brook, which my guide thought might be joined at &s;ome di&s;tance by &s;treams that would at length render it navigable. The water at fir&s;t was &s;o &s;canty, that my canoe would by no means &s;wim in it; but having &s;topped up &s;everal old beaver dams, which had been broken down by the hunters, I was enabled to proceed for &s;ome miles, till by the con|junction of a few brooks, the&s;e aids became no longer ne|ce&s;&s;ary. In a &s;hort time the water increa&s;ed to a mo&s;t ra|pid river, which we de&s;cended till it entered into Lake Superior. This river I named after a gentleman that de&s;ired to accompany me from the town of the Ottagau|mies to the Carrying Place on Lake Superior, God|dard's River.</P>
<P>To the we&s;t of this is another &s;mall river, which al&s;o empties it&s;elf into the Lake. This I termed Strawber|ry River, from the great number&punc; of &s;trawberries of a good &s;ize and flavor that grew on its banks.</P>
<P>The country from the Ottawaw Lakes to Lake Supe|rior, is in general very uneven and thickly covered with woods. The &s;oil in &s;ome places is tolerably good, in others but indifferent. In the heads of the St. Croix and the Chip&eacute;way Rivers are exceeding fine &s;turgeon. All the wilderne&s;s between the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi and Lake Su|perior is called by the Indians, the Mo&s;chettoe Country, and I thought it mo&s;t ju&s;tly named; for, it being then their &s;ea&s;on, I never &s;aw or felt &s;o many of tho&s;e in&s;ects in my life.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="021728_0068_0FB53843E804DF80">The latter end of July I arrived, after having coa&s;ted through We&s;t Bay, at the Grand Portage, which lies on the north-we&s;t borders of Lake Superior. Here tho&s;e who go on the north-we&s;t trade, to the Lakes De Pluye, Dubois, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> carry over their canoes and baggage about nine miles, till they come to a number of &s;mall lakes, the waters of &s;ome of which de&s;cend into Lake Superior, and others into the river Bourbon. Lake Superior from We&s;t Bay to this place is bounded by rocks, except towards the &s;outh-we&s;t part of the Bay where I fir&s;t entered it, there it was tolerably level.</P>
<P>At the Grand Portage is a &s;mall bay, before the en|trance of which lies an i&s;land that intercepts the dreary and uninterrupted view over the Lake, which otherwi&s;e would have pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and makes the bay &s;erene and plea&s;ant. Here I met a large party of the Killi&s;ti|noe, and A&s;&s;inipoil Indians, with their re&s;pective kings and their families. They were come to this place in order to meet the traders from Michillimackinac, who make this their road to the north-we&s;t. From them I received the following account of the Lakes that lie to the north-we&s;t of Lake Superior.</P>
<P>Lake Bourbon, the mo&s;t northern of tho&s;e yet di&s;|covered, received its name from the French traders who accompanied a party of Indians to Hud&s;on's Bay &s;ome years ago; and was thus denominated by them in honor of the royal family of France. It is compo&s;ed of the waters of the Bourbon River, which, as I have before ob&s;erved, ri&s;es a great way to the &s;outhward, not far from the northern heads of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.</P>
<P>This lake is about eighty miles in length, north and &s;outh, and is nearly circular. It has no very large i&s;lands on it. The land on the ea&s;tern &s;ide is very good; and to the &s;outh-we&s;t there are &s;ome mountains: in many other parts there are barren plains, bogs, and mora&s;&s;es. Its latitude is between fifty-two and fifty-four degrees north, and it lies nearly &s;outh-we&s;t from Hud&s;on's Bay. As through its northern &s;ituation the weather there is extremely cold, only a few animals are to be found in the country that borders on it. They gave me but an in|different account either of the bea&s;ts, birds, or fi&s;hes.

There are indeed &s;ome buffaloes of a &s;mall &s;ize, which are fat and good about the latter end of &s;ummer, with a few moo&s;e and carriboo deer: however, this deficiency is made up by the furs of every &s;ort that are to be met with in great plenty around the lake. The timber grow|ing here is chiefly fir, cedar, &s;pruce, and &s;ome ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e.</P>
<P>Lake Winnepeek, or as the French write it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Ouinipique, which lies neare&s;t to the foregoing, is com|po&s;ed of the &s;ame waters. It is in length about two hundred miles north and &s;outh; its breadth has never been properly a&s;certained, but is &s;uppo&s;ed to be about one hundred miles in its wide&s;t part. This lake is very full of i&s;lands; the&s;e are, however, of no great magni|tude. Many con&s;iderable rivers empty them&s;elves into it, which, as yet, are not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any names. The waters are &s;tored with fi&s;h, &s;uch as trout and &s;tur|geon, and al&s;o with others of a &s;maller kind peculiar to the&s;e lakes.</P>
<P>The land on the &s;outh-we&s;t part of it is very good, e&s;pecially about the entrance of a large branch of the River Bourbon, which flows from the &s;outh-we&s;t. On this river there is a factory that was built by the French, called Fort la Reine, to which the traders from Michil|limackinac re&s;ort to trade with the A&s;&s;inipoils and Kil|li&s;tinoes. To this place the Mahahs, who inhabit a coun|try two hundred and fifty miles &s;outh-we&s;t, come al&s;o to trade with them; and bring great quantities of Indian corn, to exchange for knives, tomakawks, and other ar|ticles. Tho&s;e people are &s;uppo&s;ed to dwell on &s;ome of the branches of the River of the We&s;t.</P>
<P>Lake Winnepeek has on the north-ea&s;t &s;ome moun|tains, and on the ea&s;t many barren plains. The maple or &s;ugar tree grows here in great plenty, and there is likewi&s;e gathered an amazing quantity of rice, which proves that grain will flouri&s;h in the&s;e northern climates as well as in warmer. Buffaloes, carriboo, and moo&s;e deer, are numerous in the&s;e parts. The buffaloes of this country differ from tho&s;e that are found more to the &s;outh only in &s;ize; the former being much &s;maller: ju&s;t as the black cattle of the northern parts of Great Britain differ from Engli&s;h oxen.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="021728_0070_0FB5384D97F2E3D0">On the waters that fall into this Lake, the neighbor|ing nations take great numbers of excellent furs. Some of the&s;e they carry to the factories and &s;ettlements be|longing to the Hud&s;on's Bay Company, &s;ituated above the entrance of the Bourbon River; but this they do with reluctance, on &s;everal accounts; for &s;ome of the A&s;&s;inipoils and Killi&s;tinoes, who u&s;ually traded with the Company's &s;ervants, told me, that if they could be &s;ure of a con&s;tant &s;upply of goods from Michillimackinac, they would not trade any where el&s;e. They &s;hewed me &s;ome cloth and other articles that they had purcha&s;ed at Hud&s;on's Bay, with which they were much di&s;&s;atisfied, thinking they had been greatly impo&s;ed upon in the barter.</P>
<P>Allowing that their accounts were true, I could not help joining in their opinion. But this di&s;&s;atisfaction might probably proceed, in a great mea&s;ure, from the intrigues of the Canadian traders: for whil&s;t the French were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Michillimackinac, having acquired a thorough knowledge of the trade of the north-we&s;t countries, they were employed on that account, after the reduction of Canada, by the Engli&s;h traders there, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this trade with which they were them|&s;elves quite unacquained. One of the methods they took to withdraw the&s;e Indians from their attachment to the Hud&s;on's Bay Company, and to engage their good opi|nion in behalf of their new employers, was by depreciat|ing on all occa&s;ions the Company's goods, and magnify|ing the advantages that would ari&s;e to them from traffic|ing entirely with the Canadian traders. In this they too well &s;ucceeded, and from this, doubtle&s;s, did the di&s;&s;atisfaction the A&s;&s;inipoils and Killi&s;tinoes expre&s;&s;ed to me, partly proceed. But another rea&s;on augment|ed it; and this was the length of their journey to the Hud&s;on's Bay factories, which, they informed me, took them up three months, during the &s;ummer heats to go and return, and from the &s;mallne&s;s of their canoes they could not carry more than a third of the beavers they killed. So that it is not to be wondered at, that the&s;e Indians &s;hould with to have traders come to re&s;ide among them. It is true that the parts they inhabit are within
<PB N="57" REF="021728_0071_0FB5384F18A96290">
the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay territories; but the Com|pany mu&s;t be under the nece&s;&s;ity of winking at an en|croachment of this kind, as the Indians would without doubt protect the traders when among them. Be&s;ides, the pa&s;&s;ports granted to the traders that go from Michil|limackinac give them liberty to trade to the north-we&s;t about Lake Superior; by which is meant Fort La Reine, Lake Winnepeek, or any other parts of the waters of the Bourbon River, where the Couriers de Bois, or Tra+ders, may make it mo&s;t convenient to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>Lac du Bois, as commonly termed by the French in their maps, or in Engli&s;h the Lake of the Wood, is &s;o called from the multiplicity of wood growing on its banks; &s;uch as oaks, pines, firs, &s;pruce, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Lake lies &s;till higher upon a branch of the River Bour|bon, and nearly ea&s;t from the &s;outh end of Lake Win|nepeek. It is of great depth in &s;ome places. Its length from ea&s;t to we&s;t about &s;eventy miles, and its greate&s;t breadth about forty miles. It has but few i&s;lands, and the&s;e of no great magnitude. The fi&s;hes, fowls, and quadrupeds that are found near it, vary but little from tho&s;e of the other two lakes. A few of the Killi&s;tinoe Indians &s;ometimes encamp on the borders of it to fi&s;h and hunt.</P>
<P>This Lake lies in the communication between Lake Superior, and the Lakes Winnepeek and Bourbon. Its waters are not e&s;teemed quite &s;o pure as tho&s;e of the other lakes, it having, in many places, a muddy bottom.</P>
<P>Lac La Pluye, &s;o called by the French, in Engli&s;h the Rainy Lake, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have acquired this name from the fir&s;t travellers, that pa&s;&s;ed over it, meeting with an uncommon deal of rain; or, as &s;ome have affirmed, from a mi&s;t like rain, occa&s;ioned by a perpendicular water-fall that empties it&s;elf into a river which lies to the &s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P>This Lake appears to be divided by an i&s;thmus, near the middle, into two parts: the we&s;t part is called the Great Rainy Lake, the ea&s;t, the Little Rainy Lake, as being the lea&s;t divi&s;ion. It lies a few miles further to the ea&s;tward, on the &s;ame branch of the Bourbon, than the la&s;t mentioned Lake. It is in general very &s;hallow
<PB N="58" REF="021728_0072_0FB538509821CBA0">
in its depth. The broade&s;t part of it is not more than twenty miles, its length, including both, about three hundred miles. In the we&s;t part the water is very clear and good; and &s;ome excellent fi&s;h are taken in it. A great many fowl re&s;ort here in the fall of the year. Moo&s;e deer are to be found in great plenty, and likewi&s;e the carriboo; who&s;e &s;kin for breeches or gloves exceeds by far any other to be met with in North-America. The land on the borders of this Lake is e&s;teemed, in &s;ome places, very good, but rather too thickly covered with wood. Here re&s;ide a con&s;iderable band of the Chip&eacute;ways.</P>
<P>Ea&s;tward from this Lake lie &s;everal &s;mall ones, which extend in a &s;tring to the great carrying place, and from thence into Lake Superior. Between the&s;e little Lakes are &s;everal carrying places, which renders the trade to the north-we&s;t difficult to accompli&s;h, and exceeding te|dious, as it takes two years to make one voyage from Michillimackinac to the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Red Lake is a comparatively &s;mall lake, at the head of a branch of the Bourbon River, which is called by &s;ome Red River. Its form is nearly round, and about &s;ixty miles in circumference. On one &s;ide of it is a to|lerable large i&s;land, clo&s;e by which a &s;mall river enters. It bears almo&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t both from Lake Winnepeek and from Lake du Bois. The parts adjacent are very little known or frequented, even by the &s;avages them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Not far from this Lake, a little to the &s;outh-we&s;t, is another, called White Bear Lake, which is nearly about the &s;ize of the la&s;t mentioned. The waters that compo&s;e this Lake are the mo&s;t northern of any that &s;upply the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and may be called with propriety its mo&s;t remote &s;ource. It is fed by two or three &s;mall rivers, or rather large brooks.</P>
<P>A few miles from it, to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, are a great number of &s;mall lakes, none of which are more than ten miles in circumference, that are called the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hou&s;and Lakes. In the adjacent country is reckon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fine&s;t hunting for furs of any on this continent; the Indians who hunt here, &s;eldom returning without having their ca|noes loaded as deep as they can &s;wim.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="021728_0073_0FB53854E064D0F0">Having ju&s;t before ob&s;erved that this Lake is the utmo&s;t northern &s;ource of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, I &s;hall here further remark, that before this river enters the Gulf of Mexico, it has not run le&s;s, through all its meanderings, than three thou&s;and miles; or, in a &s;traight line from north to &s;outh, about twenty degrees, which is nearly fourteen hundred Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P>The&s;e Indians informed me, that to the north-we&s;t of Lake Winnepeek lies another, who&s;e circumference va&s;tly exceeded any they had given me an account of. They de&s;cribe it as much larger than Lake Superior. But as it appears to be &s;o far to the north-we&s;t, I &s;hould imagine that it was not a lake, but rather the Archipe|lago, or broken waters that form the communication between Hud&s;on's Bay and the northern parts of the Pacific Ocean.</P>
<P>There are an infinite number of &s;mall lakes, on the more we&s;tern parts of the we&s;tern head-branches of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, as well between the&s;e and Lake Winnepeek, but none of them are large enough to &s;uppo&s;e either of them to be the lake or waters meant by the Indians.</P>
<P>They likewi&s;e informed me, that &s;ome of the north|ern branches of the Me&s;&s;orie and the &s;outhern branches of the St. Pierre have a communication with each other, except for a mile; over which they carry their canoes. And by what I could learn from them, this is the road they take when their war parties make their excur&s;ions upon the Pawnees and Pawnawnees, nations inhabiting &s;ome branches of the Me&s;&s;orie River. In the country belonging to the&s;e people it is &s;aid, that Mandrakes are frequently found, a &s;pecies of root re&s;embling human beings of both &s;exes; and that the&s;e are more perfect than &s;uch as are di&s;covered about the Nile in Nether-Ethiopia.</P>
<P>A little to the north-we&s;t of the heads of the Me&s;&s;orie and St. Pierre, the Indians further told me, that there was a nation rather &s;maller and whiter than the neigh|boring tribes, who cultivate the ground, and (as far as I could gather from their expre&s;&s;ions) in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the arts. To this account they added that &s;ome of the nations who inhabit tho&s;e parts that lie to the we&s;t of
<PB N="60" REF="021728_0074_0FB538575814D350">
the Shining Mountains, have gold &s;o plenty among them that they make their mo&s;t common uten&s;ils of it. The&s;e mountains (which I &s;hall de&s;cribe more particularly here|after) divide the waters that fall into the South Sea from tho&s;e that run into the Atlantic.</P>
<P>The people dwelling near them are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ome of the different tribes that were tributary to the Mexican kings, and who fled from their native country, to &s;eek an a&s;ylum in the&s;e parts, about the time of the conque&s;t of Mexico by the Spaniards, more than two centuries ago.</P>
<P>As &s;ome confirmation of this &s;uppo&s;ition, it is remark|ed, that they have cho&s;en the mo&s;t interior parts for their retreat, being &s;till prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a notion that the &s;ea-coa&s;ts have been infe&s;ted ever &s;ince with mon&s;ters vo|miting fire, and hurling about thunder and lightning; from who&s;e bowels i&s;&s;ued men, who, with un&s;een in&s;tru|ments, or by the power of magic, killed the harmle&s;s Indians at an a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;tance. From &s;uch as the&s;e, their fore-fathers (according to a tradition among them that &s;till remains unimpaired) fled to the retired abodes they now inhabit. For as they found that the floating mon&s;ters, which had thus terrified them could not ap|proach the land, and that tho&s;e who had de&s;cended from their &s;ides did not care to make excur&s;ions to any con&s;i|derable di&s;tance from them, they formed a re&s;olution to betake them&s;elves to &s;ome country, that lay far from the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, where only they could be &s;ecure from &s;uch di|abolical enemies. They accordingly &s;et out with their families, and after a long peregrination, &s;ettled them&s;elves near the&s;e mountains, where they concluded they had found a place of perfect &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The Winnebagoes, dwelling on the Fox River (whom I have already treated of) are likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ome &s;trolling band from the Mexican countries. But they are able to give only an imperfect account of their original re&s;idence. They &s;ay they formerly came a great way from the we&s;tward, and were driven by wars to take refuge among the Naudowe&s;&s;ies; but as they are entirely ignorant of the arts, or of the value of gold, it is rather to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they were driven from their ancient
<PB N="61" REF="021728_0075_0FB5385B2A639BB8">
&s;ettlements by the above-mentioned emigrants, as they pa&s;&s;ed on towards their pre&s;ent habitation.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, however, may want confirmation; for the &s;maller tribes of Indians are &s;ubject to &s;uch va|rious alterations in their places of abode, from the wars they are continually engaged in, that it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain, after half a century, the original &s;ituation of any of them.</P>
<P>That range of mountains, of which the Shining Mountains are a part, begin at Mexico, and continuing northward on the back, or to the ea&s;t of California, &s;epa|rate the waters of tho&s;e numerous rivers that fall either into the Gulf of Mexico, or the Gulf of California. From thence continuing their cour&s;e &s;till northward, be|tween the &s;ources of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi and the rivers that run into the South Sea, they appear to end in about forty-&s;even or forty-eight degrees of north-latitude; where a number of rivers ari&s;e, and empty them&s;elves either into the South Sea, into Hud&s;on's Bay, or into the waters that communicate between the&s;e two &s;eas.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e mountains, tho&s;e that lie to the we&s;t of the River St. Pierre, are called the Shining Mountains, from an infinite number of chry&s;tal &s;tones, of an amazing &s;ize, with which they are covered, and which, when the &s;un &s;kines full upon them, &s;parkle &s;o as to be &s;een at a very great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>This extraordinary range of mountains is calculated to be more than three thou&s;and miles in length, without any very con&s;iderable intervals, which I believe &s;urpa&s;&s;es any thing of the kind in the other quarters of the globe. Probably in future ages they may be found to contain more riches in their bowels, than tho&s;e of Indo&s;tan and Malabar, or that are produced on the golden coa&s;t of Guinea; nor will I except even the Peruvian mines. To the we&s;t of the&s;e mountains, when explored by future Columbu&s;es or Raleighs, may be found other lakes, ri|vers, and countries, full fraught with all the nece&s;&s;aries or luxuries of life; and where future generations may find an a&s;ylum, whether driven from their country by the ravages of lawle&s;s tyrants, or by religious per&s;ecutions, or re|luctantly leaving it to remedy the inconveniences ari&s;ing
<PB N="62" REF="021728_0076_0FB5385DA2B1D600">
from a &s;uperabundant increa&s;e of inhabitants; whether, I &s;ay, impelled by the&s;e, or allured by hopes of com|mercial advantages, there is little doubt but their expec|tations will be fully gratified in the&s;e rich and unex|hau&s;ted climes.</P>
<P>But to return to the A&s;&s;inipoils and Killi&s;tinoes, whom I left at the Grand Portage, and from whom I re|ceived the foregoing account of the lakes that lie to the north-we&s;t of this place.</P>
<P>The traders we expected being later this &s;ea&s;on than u&s;ual, and our numbers very con&s;iderable, for there were more than three hundred of us, the &s;tock of provi&s;ions we had brought with us was nearly exhau&s;ted, and we waited with impatience for their arrival.</P>
<P>One day, whil&s;t we were all expre&s;&s;ing our wi&s;hes for this de&s;irable event, and looking from an eminence in hopes of &s;eeing them come over the lake, the chief prie&s;t belonging to the band of the Killi&s;tinoes, told us, that he would endeavor to obtain a conference with the Great Spirit, and know from him when the traders would ar|rive. I paid little attention to this declaration, &s;uppo&s;ing that it would be productive of &s;ome juggling trick, ju&s;t &s;ufficiently covered to deceive the ignorant Indians. But the king of that tribe telling me that this was chiefly undertaken by the prie&s;t, to alleviate my anxiety, and at the &s;ame time to convince me how much intere&s;t he had with the Great Spirit, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train my animadver&s;ions on his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The following evening was fixed upon for this &s;pi|ritual conference. When every thing had been properly prepared, the king came to me and led me to a capaci|ous tent, the covering of which was drawn up, &s;o as to render what was tran&s;acting within, vi&s;ible to tho&s;e who &s;tood without. We found the tent &s;urrounded by a great number of the Indians, but we readily gained admi&s;&s;ion, and &s;eated our&s;elves on &s;kins laid on the ground for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the center I ob&s;erved that there was a place of an oblong &s;hape, which was compo&s;ed of &s;takes &s;tuck in the ground, with intervals between, &s;o as to form a kind of che&s;t or coffin, large enough to contain the body of a
<PB N="63" REF="021728_0077_0FB5385ED92ADB18">
man. The&s;e were of a middle &s;ize, and placed at &s;uch a di&s;tance from each other, that whatever lay within them was readily to he di&s;cerned. The tent was perfectly il|luminated by a great number of torches made of &s;plinters cut from the pine or birch tree, which the Indians held in their hands.</P>
<P>In a few minutes the prie&s;t entered; when an amazing large elk's &s;kin being &s;pread on the ground, ju&s;t at my feet, he laid him&s;elf down upon it, after having &s;tript him|&s;elf of every garment except that which he wore clo&s;e about his middle. Being now pro&s;trate on his back, he fir&s;t laid hold of one &s;ide of the &s;kin, and folded it over him, and then the other; leaving only his head uncovered. This was no &s;ooner done, than two of the young men who &s;tood by, took about forty yards of &s;trong cord, made al&s;o of an elk's hide, and rolled it tight round his body, &s;o that he was completely &s;wathed within the &s;kin. Be|ing thus bound up like an Egyptian Mummy, one took him by the heels, and the other by the head, and lifted him over the pales into the enclo&s;ure. I could al&s;o now di&s;cern him as plain as I had hitherto done, and I took care not to turn my eyes a moment from the object be|fore me, that I might the more readily detect the arti|fice; for &s;uch I doubted not but that it would turn out to be.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t had not lain in this &s;ituation more than a few &s;econds, when he began to mutter. This he conti|nued to do for &s;ometime, and then by degrees grew loud|er and louder, till at length he &s;poke articulately; how|ever, what he uttered was in &s;uch a mixed jargon of the Chip&eacute;way, Ottawaw, and Killi&s;tinoe languages, that I could under&s;tand but very little of it. Having continu|ed in this tone for a con&s;iderable while, he at la&s;t exerted his voice to its utmo&s;t pitch, &s;ometimes raving, and &s;ometimes praying, till he had worked him&s;elf into &s;uch an agitation, that he foamed at his mouth.</P>
<P>After having remained near three quarters of an hour in the place, and continued his vociferation with unabated vigor, he &s;eemed to be quite exhau&s;ted, and remained &s;peechle&s;s. But in an in&s;tant he &s;prung upon his feet, notwith&s;tanding at the time he was put in, it appeared
<PB N="64" REF="021728_0078_0FB538605AE9E480">
impo&s;&s;ible for him to move either his legs or arms, and &s;haking off his covering, as quick as if the bands with which it had been bound were burned a&s;under, he began to addre&s;s tho&s;e who &s;tood around, in a firm and audible voice. "My brothers," &s;aid he, <Q>the Great Spirit has deigned to hold a Talk with his &s;ervant, at my earne&s;t reque&s;t. He has not, indeed, told me when the per&s;ons we expect, will be here; but to-morrow, &s;oon after the &s;un has reached his high|e&s;t point in the heavens, a canoe will arrive, and the people in that will inform us when the traders will come.</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he &s;tepped out of the enclo&s;ure, and after he had put on his robes, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly. I own I was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed at what I had &s;een; but as I ob&s;erved that every eye in the company was fixed on me with a view to di&s;cover my &s;entiments, I carefully concealed every emotion.</P>
<P>The next day the &s;un &s;hone bright, and long before noon all the Indians were gathered together on the emi|nence that overlooked the lake. The old king came to me and a&s;ked me, whether I had &s;o much confidence is what the prie&s;t had foretold, as to join his people on the hill, and wait for the completion of it? I told him I was at a lo&s;s what opinion to form of the prediction, but that I would readily attend him. On this we walked together to the place where the others were a&s;&s;embled. Every eye was again fixed by turns on me and on the lake; when ju&s;t as the &s;un had reached his zenith; agree|able to what the prie&s;t had foretold, a canoe came round a point of land about a league di&s;tant. The Indians no &s;ooner beheld it, than they &s;et up an univer&s;al &s;hout, and by their looks &s;eemed to triumph in the intere&s;t their prie&s;t thus evidently had with the Great Spirit.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than an hour the canoe reached the &s;hore, when I attended the king and chiefs to receive tho&s;e who were on board. As &s;oon as the men were landed, we walked all together to the king's tent, when, according to their invariable cu&s;tom, we began to &s;moke; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we did, notwith&s;tanding our impatience to know the tidings they brought, without a&s;king any que&s;tions; for
<PB N="65" REF="021728_0079_0FB53864D7D94538">
the Indians are the mo&s;t deliberate people in the world. However, after &s;ome trivial conver&s;ation, the king en|quired of them, whether they had &s;een any thing of the traders? The men replied, that they had parted from them a few days before, and that they propo&s;ed being here the &s;econd day from the pre&s;ent. They accordingly arrived at that time greatly to our &s;atisfaction, but more particularly &s;o to that of the Indians, who found by this event the importance both of their prie&s;t and of their na|tion, greatly augmented in the &s;ight of a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>This &s;tory I acknowledge appears to carry with it marks of great credulity in the relator. But no one is le&s;s tinctured with that weakne&s;s than my&s;elf. The cir|cum&s;tances of it, I own, are of a very extraordinary na|ture; however, as I can vouch for their being free from either exaggeration or mi&s;repre&s;entation, being my&s;elf a cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate ob&s;erver of them all, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give them to the public. And this I do without wi&s;hing to mi&s;lead the judgement of my readers, or to make any &s;uper&s;titious impre&s;&s;ions on their minds, but leaving them to draw from it what conclu&s;ions they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved that the A&s;&s;inipoils, with a part of whom I met here, are a revolted band of the Naudowe&s;&s;ies; who on account of &s;ome real or imagined grievances, for the Indians in general are very tenacious of their liberty, had &s;eparated them&s;elves from their countrymen, and &s;ought for freedom at the expence of their ea&s;e. For the country they now inhabit about the borders of Lake Winnepeek, being much further north, is not near &s;o fertile or agreeable as that they have relin|qui&s;hed. They &s;till retain the language and manners of their former a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>The Killi&s;tinoes, now the neighbors and allies of the A&s;&s;inipoils, for they al&s;o dwell near the &s;ame lake, and on the waters of the River Bourbon, appear to hate been originally a tribe of the Chip&eacute;ways, as they &s;peak their language, though in a different dialect. Their nation con&s;i&s;ts of about three or four hundred warriors, and they &s;eem to be a hardy, brave people. I have already given an account of their country when I treated of Lake
<PB N="66" REF="021728_0080_0FB5386A6CDB8158">
Winnepeek. As they re&s;ide within the limits of Hud|&s;on's Bay, they generally trade at the factories which belong to that company, but, for the rea&s;ons mentioned before, they frequently come to the place where I hap|pened to join them, in order to meet the traders from Michillimackinac.</P>
<P>The anxiety I had felt on account of the traders de|lay, was not much alleviated by their arrival. I again found my expectations di&s;appointed, for I was not able to procure the goods I wanted from any of them. I was therefore obliged to give over my de&s;igns, and return to the place from whence I fir&s;t began my exten&s;ive cir|cuit. I accordingly took leave of the old king of the Killi&s;tinoes, with the chiefs of both bands, and departed. This prince was upwards of &s;ixty years of age, tall and &s;lightly made, but he carried him&s;elf very erect. He was of a courteous, affable di&s;po&s;ition, and treated me, as did all the chiefs, with great civility.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved that this people &s;till continued a cu&s;tom, that appeared to have been univer&s;al before any of them became acquainted with the manners of the Europeans, that of complimenting &s;trangers with the company of their wives; and this is not only practi&s;ed by the lower ranks, but by the chiefs them&s;elves, who e&s;teem it the greate&s;t proof of courte&s;y they can give a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>The beginning of October, after having coa&s;ted round the north and ea&s;t borders of Lake Superior, I arrived at Cadot's Fort, which adjoins to the Falls of St. Marie, and is &s;ituated near the &s;outh-we&s;t corner of it.</P>
<P>Lake Superior, formerly termed the Upper Lake, from its northern &s;ituation, is &s;o called on account of its being &s;uperior in magnitude, to any of the Lakes on that va&s;t continent. It might ju&s;tly be termed the Ca&s;|pian of America, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the large&s;t bo|dy of fre&s;h water on the globe. Its circumference, ac|cording to the French charts, is about fifteen hundred miles; but I believe, that if it was coa&s;ted round, and the utmo&s;t extent of every bay taken, it would exceed &s;ixteen hundred.</P>
<P>After I fir&s;t entered it from Goddard's River on the we&s;t Bay, I coa&s;ted near twelve hundred miles of the
<PB N="67" REF="021728_0081_0FB5386B9BCF1848">
north and ea&s;t &s;hores of it, and ob&s;erved that the greate&s;t part of that exten&s;ive tract was bounded by rocks and uneven ground. The water in general appeared to lie on a bed of rocks. When it was calm, and the &s;un &s;hone bright, I could &s;it in my canoe, where the depth was upwards of &s;ix fathoms, and plainly &s;ee huge piles of &s;tone at the bottom, of different &s;hapes, &s;ome of which appeared as if they were hewn. The water at this time was as pure and tran&s;parent as air; and my canoe &s;eemed as if it hung &s;u&s;pended in that element. It was impo&s;|&s;ible to look attentively through this limpid medium at the rocks below, without finding, before many minutes were elap&s;ed, your head &s;wim, and your eyes no longer able to behold the dazzling &s;cene.</P>
<P>I di&s;covered al&s;o by accident another extraordinary property in the waters of this lake. Though it was in the month of July that I pa&s;&s;ed over it, and the &s;ur|face of the water, from the heat of the &s;uperambient air, impregnated with no &s;mall degree of warmth, yet on letting down a cup to the depth of about a fathom, the water drawn from thence was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively cold, that it had the &s;ame effect when received into the mouth as ice.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of this lake is variou&s;ly laid down; but from the mo&s;t exact ob&s;ervations I could make, it lies between forty-&s;ix and fifty degrees of north-latitude, and between eighty-four and ninety-three degrees of we&s;t-longitude, from the meridian of London.</P>
<P>There are many i&s;lands in this lake, two of which are very large; and if the land of them is proper for cultiva|tion, there appears to be &s;ufficient to form on each a con&s;iderable province; e&s;pecially on I&s;le Royal, which cannot be le&s;s than an hundred miles long, and in many places forty broad. But there is no way at pre&s;ent of a&s;certaining the exact length or breadth of either. Even the French, who always kept a &s;mall &s;chooner on this lake, whil&s;t they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada, by which they could have made this di&s;covery, have only acquired a &s;light knowledge of the external parts of the&s;e i&s;lands; at lea&s;t they have never publi&s;hed any account of the in|ternal parts of them, that I could get intelligence of.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="021728_0082_0FB5386D19C0AE90">Nor was I able to di&s;cover from any of the conver&s;a|tions which I held with the neighboring Indians, that they had ever made any &s;ettlements on them, or even landed there in their hunting excur&s;ions. From what I could gather by their di&s;cour&s;e, they &s;uppo&s;e them to have been, from their fir&s;t information, the re&s;idence of the Great Spirit; and relate many ridiculous &s;tories of enchantment and magical tricks that had been experi|enced by &s;uch as were obliged through &s;tre&s;s of wea|ther to take &s;helter on them.</P>
<P>One of the Chip&eacute;way chiefs told me, that &s;ome of their people being once driven on the i&s;land of Mauro|pas, which lies towards the north-ea&s;t part of the lake, found on it large quantities of a heavy, &s;hining, yellow &s;and, that from their de&s;cription mu&s;t have been gold du&s;t. Being &s;truck with the beautiful appearance of it, in the morning, when they re-entered their canoe, they attempted to bring &s;ome away; but a &s;pirit of an amaz|ing &s;ize, according to their account, &s;ixty feet in height, &s;trode in the water after them, and commanded them to deliver back what they had taken away. Terrified at his gigantic &s;tatute, and &s;eeing that he had nearly over|taken them, they were glad to re&s;tore their &s;hining trea&s;ure; on which they were &s;uffered to depart without further mole&s;tation. Since this incident, no Indian that has ever heard of it, will venture near the &s;ame haunted coa&s;t. Be&s;ides this, they recounted to me many other &s;tories of the&s;e i&s;lands, equally fabulous.</P>
<P>The country on the north and ea&s;t parts of Lake Su|perior is very mountainous and barren. The weather being inten&s;ely cold in the winter, and the &s;un having but little power in the &s;ummer, vegetation there is very &s;low; and con&s;equently but little fruit is to be found on its &s;hore. It however produces &s;ome few &s;pecies in great abundance. Whortleberries of an uncommon &s;ize and fine flavor, grow on the mountains near the lake in amazing quantities; as do black currants and goo&s;ber|ries in the &s;ame luxuriant manner.</P>
<P>But the fruit which exceeds all the others, is a berry re&s;embling a ra&s;berry in its manner of growth, but of a lighter red, and much larger; its ta&s;te is far more deli|cious
<PB N="69" REF="021728_0083_0FB5386E98D37800">
than the fruit I have compared it to, notwith&s;tand|ing that it is &s;o highly e&s;teemed in Europe: it grows on a &s;hrub of the nature of a vine, with leaves &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the grape; and I am per&s;uaded that was it tran&s;planted into a warmer and more kindly climate, it would prove a mo&s;t rare and delicious fruit.</P>
<P>Two very large rivers empty them&s;elves into this lake, on the north and north-ea&s;t &s;ide; one is called the Nipe|gon River, or, as the French pronounce it, Allanipegon, which leads to a band of the Chip&eacute;ways, inhabiting a lake of the &s;ame name, and the other is termed the Mi|chipicooton River, the &s;ource of which is &s;ituated to|wards James's Bay, from whence there is but a &s;hort carriage to another river, which empties it&s;elf into that bay, at a fort belonging to the company. It was by this pa&s;&s;age that a party of French from Michillimackinac invaded the &s;ettlements of that &s;ociety in the reign of Queen Anne. Having taken and de&s;troyed their forts, they brought the cannon which they found in them to the fortre&s;s from whence they had i&s;&s;ued; the&s;e were &s;mall bra&s;s pieces, and remain there to this pre&s;ent time; having, through the u&s;ual revolutions of fortune, return|ed to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their former ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Not far from the Nipegon is a &s;mall river, that ju&s;t before it enters the lake, has a perpendicular fall from the top of a mountain, of more than &s;ix hundred feet. Being very narrow, it appears at a di&s;tance like a white garter &s;u&s;pended in the air.</P>
<P>A few Indians inhabit round the ea&s;tern borders of this lake, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the remains of the Algonkins, who formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this country, but who have been nearly extirpated by the Iroquois of Canada. Lake Su|perior has near forty rivers that fall into it, &s;ome of which are of a con&s;iderable &s;ize. On the &s;outh &s;ide of it is a remarkable point or cape, of about &s;ixty miles in length, called Point Chegomegan. It might as properly be termed a penin&s;ula, as it is nearly &s;eparated from the continent, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, by a narrow bay that ex|tends from ea&s;t to we&s;t. Canoes have but a &s;hort portage acro&s;s the i&s;thmus, whereas if they coa&s;t it round, the voyage is more than an hundred miles.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="021728_0084_0FB538766DE41F88">About that di&s;tance to the we&s;t of the cape ju&s;t de|&s;cribed, a con&s;iderable river falls into the lake, the head of which is compo&s;ed of a great a&s;&s;emblage of &s;mall &s;treams. This river is remarkable for the abundance of virgin copper that is found on and near its banks. A metal which is met with al&s;o in &s;everal other places on this coa&s;t. I ob&s;erved that many of the &s;mall i&s;lands, particularly tho&s;e on the ea&s;tern &s;hores, were covered with copper ore. They appeared like beds of copperas, of which many tuns lay in a &s;mall &s;pace.</P>
<P>A company of adventurers from England began, &s;oon after the conque&s;t of Canada, to bring away &s;ome of this metal, but the di&s;tracted &s;ituation of affairs in Ame|rica has obliged them to relinqui&s;h their &s;cheme. It might in future times be made a very advantageous trade, as the metal, which co&s;ts nothing on the &s;pot, and requires but little expence to get it on board, could be conveyed in boats or canoes through the Falls of St. Marie, to the I&s;le of St. Jo&s;eph, which lies at the bot|tom of the Straits near the entrance into Lake Huron; from thence it might be put on board larger ve&s;&s;els, and in them tran&s;ported acro&s;s that lake to the Falls of Ni|agara; there being carried by land acro&s;s the Portage, it might be conveyed without much more ob&s;truction to Quebec. The cheapne&s;s and ea&s;e with which any quan|tity of it may be procured, will make up for the length of way that is nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;port it before it reaches the &s;ea coa&s;t, and enable the proprietors to &s;end it to foreign markets on as good terms as it can be exported from other countries.</P>
<P>Lake Superior abounds with a variety of fi&s;h, the principal and be&s;t are the trout and &s;turgeon, which may be caught at almo&s;t any &s;ea&s;on in the greate&s;t abun|dance. The trouts in general weigh about twelve pounds, but &s;ome are caught that exceed fifty. Be&s;ides the&s;e, a &s;pecies of white fi&s;h is taken in great quantities here, that re&s;emble a &s;had in their &s;hape, but they are rather thicker, and le&s;s bony; they weigh about four pounds each, and are of a delicious ta&s;te. The be&s;t way of catching the&s;e fi&s;h is with a net; but the trout might be taken at all times with the hook. There are like|wi&s;e
<PB N="71" REF="021728_0085_0FB53877994D4B80">
many &s;orts of &s;maller fi&s;h in great plenty here, and which may be taken with ea&s;e; among the&s;e is a &s;ort re&s;embling a herring, that are generally made u&s;e of as a bait for the trout. Very &s;mall crabs, not larger than half a crown piece, are found both in this and Lake Michigan.</P>
<P>This Lake is as much affected by &s;torms as the Atlan|tic Ocean; the waves run as high, and are equally as dangerous to &s;hips. It di&s;charges its waters from the &s;outh-ea&s;t corner, through the Straits of St. Marie. At the upper end of the&s;e Straits &s;tands a fort that receives its name from them, commanded by Mon&s;. Cadot, a French Canadian, who being proprietor of the &s;oil, is &s;till permitted to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Near this fort is a very &s;trong rapid, again&s;t which, though it is impo&s;&s;ible for canoes to a&s;cend, yet when conducted by careful pi|lots, they might pa&s;s down without danger.</P>
<P>Though Lake Superior, as I have before ob&s;erved, is &s;upplied by near forty rivers, many of which are con&s;i|derable ones; yet it does not appear that one tenth part of the waters which are conveyed into it by the&s;e rivers, are carried off at this evacuation. How &s;uch a &s;uper-abundance of waters can be di&s;po&s;ed of, as it mu&s;t cer|tainly be by &s;ome means or other, without which the circumference of the lake would be continually enlarging, I know not: that it does not empty it&s;elf, as the Medi|terranaen &s;ea is &s;uppo&s;ed to do, by an under current, which perpetually counteracts that near the &s;urface, is certain; for the &s;tream which falls over the rock is not more than five or &s;ix feet in depth, and the whole of it pa&s;&s;es on through the Straits into the adjacent lake; nor is it probable that &s;o great a quantity can be ab&s;orb|ed by exhalations; con&s;equently they mu&s;t find a pa&s;&s;age through &s;ome &s;ubterranean cavities, deep, unfathomable, and never to be explored.</P>
<P>The Falls of St. Marie do not de&s;cend perpendicular|ly as tho&s;e of Niagara or St. Anthony do, but con&s;i&s;t of a rapid which continues near three quarters of a mile, over which canoes well piloted might pa&s;s.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the&s;e Falls, Nature has formed a mo&s;t commodious &s;tation for catching the fi&s;h which are
<PB N="72" REF="021728_0086_0FB5387920B77148">
to be found there in immen&s;e quantities. Per&s;ons &s;tand|ing on the rocks that lie adjacent to it, may take with dipping nets, about the months of September and Oc|tober, the white fi&s;h before mentioned; at that &s;ea&s;on, together with &s;everal other &s;pecies, they crowd up to this &s;pot in &s;uch amazing &s;hoals, that enough may be taken to &s;upply, when properly cured, thou&s;ands of in|habitants throughout the year.</P>
<P>The Straits of St. Marie are about forty miles long, bearing &s;outh-ea&s;t, but varying much in their breadth. The current between the Falls and Lake Huron is not &s;o rapid as might be expected, nor do they prevent the navigation of &s;hips of burden as far up as the I&s;land of St. Jo&s;eph.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved by travellers that the entrance in|to Lake Superior, from the&s;e Straits, affords one of the mo&s;t-plea&s;ing pro&s;pects in the world. The place in which this might be viewed to the greate&s;t advantage, is ju&s;t at the opening of the lake, from whence may be &s;een on the left, many beautiful little i&s;lands that extend a con&s;iderable way before you; and on the right, an agreeable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;mall points of land, that pro|ject a little way into the water, and contribute, with the i&s;lands, to render this delightful ba&s;on (as it might be termed) calm and &s;ecure from the ravages of tho&s;e tempe&s;tuous winds by which the adjoining lake is fre|quently troubled.</P>
<P>Lake Huron, into which you now enter from the Straits of St. Marie, is the next in magnitude to Lake Superior. It lies between forty-two and forty-&s;ix de|grees of north-latitude, and &s;eventy-nine and eighty-five degrees of we&s;t-longitude. Its &s;hape is nearly triangular, and its circumference about one thou&s;and miles.</P>
<P>On the north &s;ide of it lies an i&s;land that is remark|able for being near an hundred miles in length, and no more than eight miles broad. This i&s;land is known by the name of Manataulin, which &s;ignifies a Place of Spi|rits, and is con&s;idered by the the Indians as &s;acred as tho&s;e already mentioned in Lake Superior.</P>
<P>About the middle of the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of this lake, is Saganaum Bay. The capes that &s;eparate this bay
<PB N="73" REF="021728_0087_0FB5387A98798C78">
from the lake, are eighteen miles di&s;tant from each other; near the middle of the intermediate &s;pace &s;tand two i&s;lands, which greatly tend to facilitate the pa&s;&s;age of canoes and &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, by affording them &s;helter, as without this &s;ecurity it would not be prudent to venture acro&s;s &s;o wide a &s;ea; and the coa&s;ting round the bay would make the voyage long and tedious. This bay is about eighty miles in length, and in general about eigh|teen or twenty miles broad.</P>
<P>Nearly half way between Saganaum Bay and the north-we&s;t corner of the Lake, lies another, which is term|ed Thunder Bay. The Indians, who have frequented the&s;e parts from time immemorial, and every European tra|veller that has pa&s;&s;ed through it, have unanimou&s;ly agreed to call it by this name, on account of the continual thunder they have always ob&s;erved here. The bay is about nine miles broad, and the &s;ame in length, and whil&s;t I was pa&s;&s;ing over it, which took me up near twenty-four hours, it thundered and lightened during the greate&s;t part of the time to an exce&s;&s;ive degree.</P>
<P>There appeared to be no vi&s;ible rea&s;on for this, that I could di&s;cover, nor is the country in general &s;ubject to thunder; the hills that &s;tood around were not of a re|markable height, neither did the external parts of them &s;eem to be covered with any &s;ulphureous &s;ub&s;tance. But as this phaenomenon mu&s;t originate from &s;ome natural cau&s;e, I conjecture that the &s;hores of the bay, or the ad|jacent mountains, are either impregnated with an un|common quantity of &s;ulphureous matter, or contain &s;ome metal or mineral apt to attract in a great degree, the electrical particles that are hourly borne over them by the pa&s;&s;ant clouds. But the &s;olution of this, and tho&s;e other philo&s;ophical remarks which ca&s;ually occur throughout the&s;e pages, I leave to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of abler heads.</P>
<P>The fi&s;h in Lake Huron are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e in Lake Superior. Some of the land on its banks is very fertile, and proper for cultivation, but in other parts it is &s;andy and barren. The promontory that &s;e|parates this lake from Lake Michigan, is compo&s;ed of a va&s;t plain, upwards of one hundred miles long, but
<PB N="74" REF="021728_0088_0FB5388175295448">
varying in its breadth, being from ten to fifteen miles broad. This tract, as I have before ob&s;erved, is divid|ed into almo&s;t an equal portion between the Ottawaw and Chip&eacute;way Indians. At the north-ea&s;t corner this lake has a communication with Lake Michigan, by the Straits of Michillimackinac already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>I had like to have omitted a very extraordinary cir|cum&s;tance, relative to the&s;e Straits. According to ob|&s;ervations made by the French, whil&s;t they were in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort: although there is no diurnal flood or ebb to be perceived in the&s;e waters, yet, from an exact attention to their &s;tate, a periodical alteration in them has been di&s;covered. It was ob&s;erved that they aro&s;e by gradual, but almo&s;t imperceptible degrees till they had reached the height of about three feet. This was ac|compli&s;hed in &s;even years and a half; and in the &s;ame &s;pace they as gently decrea&s;ed, till they had reached their former &s;ituation; &s;o that in fifteen years they had com|pleted this inexplicable revolution.</P>
<P>At the time I was there, the truth of the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions could not be confirmed by the Engli&s;h, as they had then been only a few years in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort; but they all agreed that &s;ome alteration in the limits of the Straits was apparent. All the&s;e lakes are &s;o af|fected by the winds, as &s;ometimes to have the appear|ance of a tide, according as they happen to blow; but this is only temporary and partial.</P>
<P>A great number of the Chip&eacute;way Indians live &s;cat|tered around this lake, particularly near Saganaum Bay. On its banks are found an amazing quantity of the &s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">erries, and in the adjacent country nearly the &s;ame fruit, as tho&s;e that grow about the other lakes.</P>
<P>From the Falls of St. Marie I lei&s;urely proceeded back to Michillimackinac, and arrived there the begin|ning of November 1767, having been fourteen months on this exten&s;ive tour, travelled near four thou&s;and miles, and vi&s;ited twelve nations of Indians lying to the we&s;t and north of this place. The winter &s;etting in &s;oon af|ter my arrival, I was obliged to tarry there till June fol|lowing, the navigation over Lake Huron for large ve&s;|&s;els not being open, on account of the ice, till that time.

Meeting here with &s;ociable company, I pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e months very agreeably, and without finding the hours tedious.</P>
<P>One of my chief amu&s;ements was that of fi&s;hing for trouts. Though the Straits were covered with ice, we found means to make holes through it, and letting down &s;trong lines of fifteen yards in length, to which were fix|ed three or four hooks baited with the &s;mall fi&s;h before de&s;cribed, we frequently caught two at a time of forty pounds weight each; but the common &s;ize is from ten to twenty pounds. The&s;e are mo&s;t delicious food. The method of pre&s;erving them during the three months the winter generally la&s;ts, is by hanging them up in the air; and in one night they will be frozen &s;o hard that they will keep as well as if they were cured with &s;alt.</P>
<P>I have only pointed out in the plan of my travels the circuit I made from my leaving Michillimackinac till I arrived again at that fort. Tho&s;e countries that lie nearer to the colonies have been &s;o often and &s;o minute|ly de&s;cribed, that any further account of them would be u&s;ele&s;s. I &s;hall therefore only give my readers in the remainder of my journal, as I at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, a de|&s;cription of the other great lakes of Canada, many of which I have navigated over, and relate at the &s;ame time a few particular incidents that I tru&s;t will not be found inapplicable or unentertaining.</P>
<P>In June 1768 I left Michillimackinac, and returned in the Gladwyn Schooner, a ve&s;&s;el of about eighty tons burthen, over Lake Huron to Lake St. Claire, where we left the &s;hip, and proceeded in boats to Detroit. This lake is about ninety miles in circumference, and by the way of Huron River, which runs from the &s;outh corner of Lake Huron, receives the waters of the three great lakes, Superior, Michigan, and Huron. Its form is rather round, and in &s;ome places it is deep enough for the navigation of large ve&s;&s;els, but towards the middle of it there is a bar of &s;and, which prevents tho&s;e that are loaded from pa&s;&s;ing over it. Such as are in balla&s;t only may find water &s;ufficient to carry them quite through; the cargoes, however, of &s;uch as are freight|ed
<PB N="76" REF="021728_0090_0FB538845D0755E0">
mu&s;t be taken out, and after being tran&s;ported acro&s;s the bar in boats, re-&s;hipped again.</P>
<P>The river that runs from Lake St. Claire to Lake Erie (or rather the Strait, for thus it might be termed from its name) is called Detroit, which is in French, the Strait. It runs nearly &s;outh, has a gentle current, and depth of water &s;ufficient for &s;hips of con&s;iderable burthen. The town of Detroit is &s;ituated on the we&s;tern banks of this river, about nine miles below Lake St. Claire.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t oppo&s;ite on the ea&s;tern &s;hore, is the village of the ancient Hurons: a tribe of Indians which have been treated of by &s;o many writers, that adhering to the re|&s;trictions I have laid my&s;elf under of only de&s;cribing places and people little known, or incidents that have pa&s;&s;|ed unnoticed by others, I &s;hall omit giving a de&s;cription of them. A mi&s;&s;ionary of the order of Carthu&s;ian Fri|ars, by permi&s;&s;ion of the bi&s;hop of Canada, re&s;ides among them.</P>
<P>The banks of the River Detroit, both above and be|low the&s;e towns, are covered with &s;ettlements that ex|tend more than twenty miles; the country being exceed|ingly fruitful, and proper for the cultivation of wheat, Indian corn, oats, and peas. It has al&s;o many &s;pots of fine pa&s;turage; but as the inhabitants, who are chiefly French that &s;ubmitted to the Engli&s;h government, af|ter the conque&s;t of the&s;e parts by General Amher&s;t, are more attentive to the Indian trade than to farming, it is but badly cultivated.</P>
<P>The town of Detroit contains upwards of one hun|dred hou&s;es. The &s;treets are &s;omewhat regular, and have a range of very convenient and hand&s;ome barracks, with a &s;pacious parade at the &s;outh end. On the we&s;t &s;ide lies the king's garden, belonging to the governor, which is very well laid out, and kept in good order. The fortifications of the town con&s;i&s;t of a &s;trong &s;tock|ade, made of round piles, fixed firmly in the ground, and lined with pali&s;ades. The&s;e are defended by &s;ome &s;mall ba&s;tions, on which are mounted a few indifferent cannon of an incon&s;iderable &s;ize, ju&s;t &s;ufficient for its de|fence again&s;t the Indians, or an enemy not provided with artillery.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="021728_0091_0FB53885D7B71738">The garri&s;on, in time of peace, con&s;i&s;ts of two hun|dred men, commanded by a field officer, who acts as chief magi&s;trate under the governor of Canada. Mr. Turnbull, captain of the 60th regiment, or Royal Ame|ricans, was commandant when I happened to be there. This gentleman was de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed and re&s;pected, both by the inhabitants and traders, for the propriety of his conduct; and I am happy to have an opportunity of thus publicly making my acknowledgments to him for the civilities I received from him during my &s;tay.</P>
<P>In the year 1762, in the month of July, it rained on this town and the parts adjacent, a &s;ulphureous water of the color and con&s;i&s;tence of ink; &s;ome of which being collected into bottles, and wrote with, appeared perfectly intelligible on the paper, and an&s;wered every purpo&s;e of that u&s;eful liquid. Soon after, the Indian wars already &s;poken of, broke out in the&s;e parts. I mean not &s;ay that this incident was ominous of them, notwith&s;tanding, it is well known that innumerable well atte&s;ted in&s;tances of extraordinary phaenomena happening before extraor|dinary events, have been recorded in almo&s;t every age by hi&s;torians of veracity; I only relate the circum&s;tances as a fact, of which I was informed by many per&s;ons of undoubted probity, and leave my readers, as I have hi|therto done, to draw their own conclu&s;ions from it.</P>
<P>Pontiac, under whom the party that &s;urpri&s;ed Fort Michillimackinac, as related in the former part of this work, acted, was an enterpri&s;ing chief or head-warrior of the Miames. During the late war between the Engli&s;h and the French, he had been a &s;teady friend to the lat|ter, and continued his inveteracy to the former, even after peace had been concluded between the&s;e two na|tions. Unwilling to put an end to the depredations he had been &s;o long engaged in, he collected an army of confederate Indians, con&s;i&s;ting of the nations before enu|merated, with an intention to renew the war. However, in&s;tead of openly attacking the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements, he laid a &s;cheme for taking by &s;urpri&s;e tho&s;e forts on the extremities which they had lately gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of.</P>
<P>How well the party he detached to take Fort Michil|limackinac &s;ucceeded, the reader already knows. To
<PB N="78" REF="021728_0092_0FB5388CB1508300">
get into his hands Detroit, a place of greater con&s;e|quence, and much better guarded, required greater re|&s;olution, and more con&s;ummate art. He of cour&s;e took the management of this expedition on him&s;elf, and drew near it with the principal body of his troops. He was, however, prevented from carrying his de&s;igns into exe|cution, by an apparently trivial and unfore&s;een circum|&s;tance. On &s;uch does the fate of mighty Empires fre|quently depend!</P>
<P>The town of Detroit, when Pontiac formed his plan, was garri&s;oned by about three hundred men, commanded by Major Gladwyn, a gallant officer. As at that time every appearance of war was at an end, and the Indians &s;eemed to be on a friendly footing, Pontiac approached the Fort, without exciting any &s;u&s;picions in the brea&s;t of the governor or the inhabitants. He encamped at a little di&s;tance from it, and &s;ent to let the commandant know that he was come to trade; and being de&s;irous of brightening the chain of peace between the Engli&s;h and his nation, de&s;ired that he and his chiefs might be ad|mitted to hold a council with him. The governor &s;till un&s;u&s;picious, and not in the lea&s;t doubting the &s;incerity of the Indians, granted their general's reque&s;t, and fix|ed on the next morning for their reception.</P>
<P>The evening of that day, an Indian woman who had been employed by Major Gladwyn, to make him a pair of Indian &s;hoes, out of curious elk-&s;kin, brought them home. The Major was &s;o plea&s;ed with them, that, in|tending the&s;e as a pre&s;ent for a friend, he ordered her to take the remainder back, and make it into others for him&s;elf. He then directed his &s;ervant to pay her for tho&s;e &s;he had done, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her. The woman went to the door that led to the &s;treet, but no further; &s;he there loitered about as if &s;he had not fini&s;hed the bu|&s;ine&s;s on which &s;he came. A &s;ervant at length ob&s;erved her, and a&s;ked her why &s;he &s;taid there; &s;he gave him, however, no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Some &s;hort time after, the governor him&s;elf &s;aw her; and enquired of his &s;ervant what occa&s;ioned her &s;tay. Not being able to get a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, he ordered the woman to be called in. When &s;he came into his
<PB N="79" REF="021728_0093_0FB5388E191A0298">
pre&s;ence he de&s;ired to know what was the rea&s;on of her loitering about, and not ha&s;tening home before the gates were &s;hut, that &s;he might complete in due time the work he had given her to do. She told him, after much he&s;itation, that as he had always behaved with great goodne&s;s towards her, &s;he was unwilling to take away the remainder of the &s;kin, becau&s;e he put &s;o great a va|lue upon it; and yet had not been able to prevail up|on her&s;elf to tell him &s;o. He then a&s;ked her, why &s;he was more reluctant to do &s;o now, than &s;he had been when &s;he made the former pair. With increa&s;ed re|luctance &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he never &s;hould be able to bring them back.</P>
<P>His curio&s;ity being now excited, he in&s;i&s;ted on her di&s;clo&s;ing to him the &s;ecret that &s;eemed to be &s;truggling in her bo&s;om for utterance. At la&s;t, on receiving a pro|mi&s;e that the intelligence &s;he was about to give him &s;hould not turn to her prejudice, and that if it ap|peared to be beneficial, &s;he &s;hould be rewarded for it, &s;he informed him, that at the council to be held with the Indians the following day, Pontiac and his chiefs intend|ed to murder him; and, after having ma&s;&s;acred the gar|ri&s;on and inhabitants, to plunder the town. That for this purpo&s;e all the chiefs who were to be admitted in|to the council-room, had cut their guns &s;hort, &s;o that they could conceal them under their blankets; with which, at a &s;ignal given by their general, on delivering the belt, they were all to ri&s;e up, and in&s;tantly to fire on him and his attendants. Having effected this, they were immediately to ru&s;h into the town, where they would find them&s;elves &s;upported by a great number of their warriors, that were to come into it during the &s;it|ting of the council, under pretence of trading, but pri|vately armed in the &s;ame manner. Having gained from the woman every nece&s;&s;ary particular relative to the plot, and al&s;o of the means by which &s;he acquired a know|ledge of them, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her with injunctions of &s;e|crecy, and a promi&s;e of fulfilling on his part with punc|tuality, the engagements he had entered into.</P>
<P>The intelligence the governor had ju&s;t received, gave him great unea&s;ine&s;s; and he immediately con&s;ulted the
<PB N="80" REF="021728_0094_0FB5388F999DC510">
officer who was next to him in command, on the &s;ub|ject. But that gentleman con&s;idering the information as a &s;tory invented for &s;ome artful purpo&s;es, advi&s;ed him to pay no attention to it. This conclu&s;ion, however, had happily no weight with him. He thought it prudent to conclude it to be true, till he was convinced that it was not &s;o; and therefore, without revealing his &s;u&s;picions to any other per&s;on, he took every needful precaution that the time would admit of. He walked round the fort during the whole night, and &s;aw him&s;elf that every centinel was on duty, and every weapon of defence in proper order.</P>
<P>As he traver&s;ed the ramparts which lay neare&s;t to the Indian camp, he heard them in high fe&s;tivity, and, little imagining that their plot was di&s;covered, probably plea&s;|ing them&s;elves with the anticipation of their &s;ucce&s;s. As &s;oon as the morning dawned, he ordered all the garri|&s;on under arms; and then imparting his apprehen&s;ions to a few of the principal officers, gave them &s;uch direc|tions as he thought nece&s;&s;ary. At the &s;ame time he &s;ent round to all the traders, to inform them, that as it was expected a great number of Indians would enter the town that day, who might be inclined to plunder, he de&s;ired they would have their arms ready, and repel eve|ry attempt of that kind.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock, Pontiac and his chiefs arrived; and were conducted to the council-chamber, where the go|vernor and his principal officers, each with pi&s;tols in their belts, awaited his arrival. As the Indians pa&s;&s;ed on, they could not help ob&s;erving that a greater number of troops than u&s;ual were drawn up on the parade, or marching about. No &s;ooner were they entered, and &s;eated on the &s;kins prepared for them, than Pontiac a&s;k|ed the governor on what occa&s;ion his young men, mean|ing the &s;oldiers, were thus drawn up, and parading the &s;treets. He received for an&s;wer, that it was only in|tended to keep them perfect in their exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>The Indian chief-warrior now began his &s;peech, which contained the &s;tronge&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and good-will towards the Engli&s;h; and when he came to the delivery of the belt of wampum, the particular mode
<PB N="81" REF="021728_0095_0FB538921CB61900">
of which, according to the woman's information, was to be the &s;ignal for his chiefs to fire, the governor and all his attendants drew their &s;words halfway out of their &s;cabbards; and the &s;oldiers at the &s;ame in&s;tant made a clattering with their arms before the doors, which had been purpo&s;ery left open. Pontiac, though one of the bolde&s;t of men, immediately turned pale, and trembled; and in&s;tead of giving the belt in the manner propo&s;ed, delivered it according to the u&s;ual way. His chiefs, who had impatiently expected the &s;ignal, looked at each other with a&s;toni&s;hment, but continued quiet, waiting the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>The governor in his turn made a &s;peech; but in&s;tead of thanking the great warrior for the profe&s;&s;ions of friend|&s;hip he had ju&s;t uttered, he accu&s;ed him of being a trai|tor. He told him that the Engli&s;h, who knew every thing, were convinced of his treachery and villainous de&s;igns; and as a proof that they were well acquainted with his mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts and intentions, he &s;tepped towards the Indian chief that &s;at neare&s;t to him, and drawing a&s;ide his blanket, di&s;covered the &s;hortened fire|lock. This entirely di&s;concerted the Indians, and fru&s;|trated their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>He then continued to tell them, that as he had given his word at the time they de&s;ired an audience, that their per&s;ons &s;hould be &s;afe, he would hold his promi&s;e invi|olable, though they &s;o little de&s;erved it. However, he advi&s;ed them to make the be&s;t of their way out of the fort, left his young men on being acquainted with their treacherous purpo&s;es, &s;hould cut every one of them to pieces.</P>
<P>Pontiac endeavored to contradict the accu&s;ation, and to make excu&s;es for his &s;u&s;picious conduct; but the go|vernor, &s;atisfied of the fal&s;ity of his prote&s;tations, would not li&s;ten to him. The Indians immediately left the fort, but in&s;tead of being &s;en&s;ible of the governor's gene|rous behavior, they threw of the ma&s;k, and the next day made a regular attack upon it.</P>
<P>Major Gladwyn has not e&s;caped cen&s;ure for this mi&s;|taken lenity; for probably had he kept a few of the principal chiefs pri&s;oners, whil&s;t he had them in his pow|er,
<PB N="82" REF="021728_0096_0FB538945CBC2BB0">
he might have been able to have brought the whole confederacy to terms, and have prevented a war. But he atoned for this over&s;ight, by the gallant defence he made for more than a year, amid&s;t a variety of di&s;courage|ments.</P>
<P>During that period &s;ome very &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;hes happen|ed between the be&s;iegers and the garri&s;on, of which the following was the principal and mo&s;t bloody: Captain Delzel, a brave officer, prevailed on the governor to give him the command of about two hundred men, and to permit him to attack the enemy's camp. This being complied with, he &s;allied from the town before day-break; but Pontiac, receiving from &s;ome of his &s;wift-footed warriors, who were con&s;tantly employed in watch|ing the motions of the garri&s;on, timely intelligence of their de&s;ign, he collected together the choice&s;t of his troops, and met the detachment at &s;ome di&s;tance from his camp, near a place &s;ince called Bloody-Bridge.</P>
<P>As the Indians were va&s;tly &s;uperior in numbers to Captain Delzel's party, he was &s;oon over-powered and driven back. Being now nearly &s;urrounded, he made a vigorous effort to regain the bridge he had ju&s;t cro&s;&s;ed, by which alone he could find a retreat; but in doing this he lo&s;t his life, and many of his men fell with him. However, Major Rogers, the &s;econd in command, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by Lieutenant Breham, found means to draw off the &s;hattered remains of their little army, and conducted them into the fort.</P>
<P>Thus con&s;iderably reduced, it was with difficulty the Major could defend the town; notwith&s;tanding which, he held out again&s;t the Indians till he was relieved, as af|ter this they made but few attacks on the place, and on|ly continued to blockade it.</P>
<P>The Gladwyn Schooner (that in which I afterwards took my pa&s;&s;age from Michillimackinac to Detroit, and which I &s;ince learn was lo&s;t with all her crew, on Lake Erie, through the ob&s;tinacy of the commander, who could not be prevailed upon to take in &s;ufficient balla&s;t) arrived about this time, near the town, with a reinforce|ment, and nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. But before this ve&s;&s;el could reach the place of its de&s;tination, it was mo&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="021728_0097_0FB5389C5C18DF00">
vigorou&s;ly attacked by a detachment from Pontiac's ar|my. The Indians &s;urrounded it in their canoes, and made great havoc among the crew.</P>
<P>At length the captain of the &s;chooner, with a con&s;i|derable number of his men being killed, and the &s;avages beginning to climb up the &s;ides from every quarter, the lieutenant (Mr. Jacobs, who afterwards commanded, and was lo&s;t in it) being determinated that the &s;tores &s;hould not fall into the enemy's hands, and &s;eeing no other al|ternative, ordered the gunner to &s;et fire to the powder-room, and blow the &s;hip up. This order was on the point of being executed, when a chief of the Hurons, who under&s;tood the Engli&s;h language, gave out to his friends the intention of the commander. On receiving this intelligence, the Indians hurried down the &s;ides of the &s;hip with the greate&s;t precipitation, and got as far from it as po&s;&s;ible; whil&s;t the commander immediately took advantage of their con&s;ternation, and arrived with|out any further ob&s;truction at the town.</P>
<P>This &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply gave the garri&s;on fre&s;h &s;pirits; and Pontiac being now convinced that it would not be in his power to reduce the place, propo&s;ed an accom|modation; the governor wi&s;hing as much to get rid of &s;uch trouble&s;ome enemies, who ob&s;tructed the intercour&s;e of the traders with the neighboring nations, li&s;tened to his propo&s;als, and having procured advantageous terms, agreed to a peace. The Indians &s;oon after &s;eparated, and returned to their different provinces; nor have they &s;ince thought proper to di&s;turb, at lea&s;t in any great de|gree, the tranquillity of the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Pontiac henceforward &s;eemed to have laid a&s;ide the animo&s;ity he had hitherto borne towards the Engli&s;h, and apparently became their zealous friend. To reward this new attachment, and to in&s;ure a continuance of it, go|vernment allowed him a hand&s;ome pen&s;ion. But his re&s;t|le&s;s and intriguing &s;pirit would not &s;uffer him to be grate|ful for this allowance, and his conduct at length grew &s;u&s;|picious; &s;o that going, in the year 1767, to hold a coun|cil in the country of the Illinois, a faithful Indian, who was either commi&s;&s;ioned by one of the Engli&s;h governors, or in&s;tigated by the love he bore the Engli&s;h nation, at|tended
<PB N="84" REF="021728_0098_0FB532B015C499F0">
him as a &s;py; and being convinced from the &s;peech Pontiac made in the council, that he &s;till retained his former prejudices again&s;t tho&s;e for whom he now pro|fe&s;&s;ed a friend&s;hip, he plunged his knife into his heart, as &s;oon as he had done &s;peaking, and laid him dead on the &s;pot. But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lake Erie receives the waters by which it is &s;upplied from the three great lakes, through the Straits of Detroit, that lie at its north-we&s;t corner. This lake is &s;ituated between forty-one and forty-three degrees of north-lati|tude, and between &s;eventy-eight and eighty-three de|grees of we&s;t-longitude. It is near three hundred miles long from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and about forty in its broade&s;t part: and a remarkable long narrow point lies on its north &s;ide, that projects for &s;everal miles into the lake to|wards the &s;outh-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal i&s;lands near the we&s;t end of it &s;o in|fe&s;ted with rattle-&s;nakes, that it is very dangerous to land on them. It is impo&s;&s;ible that any place can produce a greater number of all kinds of the&s;e reptiles than this does, particularly of the water-&s;nake. The lake is co|vered near the banks of the i&s;lands with the large pond|lily; the leaves of which lie on the &s;urface of the water &s;o thick, as to cover it entirely for many acres together; and on each of the&s;e lay, when I pa&s;&s;ed over it, wreaths of water-&s;nakes ba&s;king in the &s;un, which amounted to myriads.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable of the different &s;pecies that in|fe&s;t this lake, is the hi&s;&s;ing-&s;nake, which is of the &s;mall &s;peckled kind, and about eighteen inches long. When any thing approaches, it flattens it&s;elf in a moment, and its &s;pots, which are of various dyes, become vi&s;ibly bright|er through rage; at the &s;ame time it blows from its mouth, with great force, a &s;ubtile wind, that is report|ed to be of a nau&s;eous &s;mell; and if drawn in with the breath of the unwary traveller, will infallibly bring on a decline, that in a few months mu&s;t prove mortal, there being no remedy yet di&s;covered which can counteract its baneful influence.</P>
<P>The &s;tones and pebbles on the &s;hores of this lake are mo&s;t of them tinged, in a greater or le&s;s degree, with
<PB N="85" REF="021728_0099_0FB532B1569E96A0">
&s;pots that re&s;emble bra&s;s in their color, but which are of a more &s;ulphureous nature. Small pieces, about the &s;ize of hazle-nuts, of the &s;ame kinds of ore, are found on the &s;ands that lie on its banks, and under the water.</P>
<P>The navigation of this lake is e&s;teemed more danger|ous than any of the others, on account of many high lands that lie on the borders of it, and project into the water, in a perpendicular direction for many miles together; &s;o that whenever &s;udden &s;torms ari&s;e, canoes and boats are frequently lo&s;t, as there is no place for them to find a &s;helter.</P>
<P>This lake di&s;charges its waters at the north-ea&s;t end, into the River Niagara, which runs north and &s;outh, and is about thirty-&s;ix miles in length; from whence it falls into Lake Ontario. At the entrance of this river, on its ea&s;tern &s;hore, lies Fort Niagara; and, about eighteen miles further up, tho&s;e remarkable Falls which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eem|ed one of the mo&s;t extraordinary productions of nature at pre&s;ent known.</P>
<P>As the&s;e have been vi&s;ited by &s;o many travellers, and &s;o frequently de&s;cribed, I &s;hall omit giving a particular de&s;cription of them, and only ob&s;erve, that the waters by which they are &s;upplied, after taking their ri&s;e near two thou&s;and miles to the north-we&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ing through the Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie, during which they have been receiving con&s;tant accumulations, at length ru&s;h down a &s;tupendous precipice of one hun|dred and forty feet perpendicular; and in a &s;trong ra|pid, that extends to the di&s;tance of eight or nine miles below, fall nearly as much more: this river &s;oon after empties it&s;elf into Lake Ontario.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e of the&s;e Falls may be heard an amazing way. I could plainly di&s;tingui&s;h them in a calm morning more than twenty miles. Others have &s;aid that at par|ticular times, and when the wind &s;its fair, the &s;ound of them reaches fifteen leagues.</P>
<P>The land about the Falls is exceedingly hilly and un|even, but the greate&s;t part of that on the Niagara River is very good, e&s;pecially for gra&s;s and pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>Fort Niagara &s;tands nearly at the entrance of the we&s;t end of Lake Ontario, and on the ea&s;t part of the Straits

of Niagara. It was taken from the French in the year 1759, by the forces under the command of Sir William John&s;on, and at pre&s;ent is defended by a con&s;iderable garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Lake Ontario is the next, and lea&s;t of the five great Lakes of Canada. Its &s;ituation is between forty-three and forty-five degrees of latitude, and between &s;eventy-&s;ix and &s;eventy-nine degrees of we&s;t-longitude. The form of it is nearly oval, its greate&s;t length being from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t, and in circumference, about &s;ix hundred miles. Near the &s;outh-ea&s;t part it receives the waters of the O&s;wego River, and on the north-ea&s;t di&s;|charges it&s;elf into the River Cataraqui. Not far from the place where it i&s;&s;ues, Fort Frontena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> formerly &s;tood, which was taken from the French during the la&s;t war, in the year 1758, by a &s;mall army of Provincials under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rad&s;treet.</P>
<P>At the entrance of O&s;wego River &s;tands a fort of the &s;ame name, garri&s;oned only at pre&s;ent by an incon&s;idera|ble party. This fort was taken in the year 1756, by the French, when a great part of the garri&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ted of the late Shirley's and Pepperil's regiments, were ma&s;&s;acred in cold blood by the &s;avages.</P>
<P>In Lake Ontario are taken many &s;orts of fi&s;h, among which is the O&s;wego Ba&s;s, of an excellent flavor, and weighing about three or four pounds. There is al&s;o a &s;ort called the Cat-head or Pout, which are in general very large, &s;ome of them weighing eight or ten pounds; and they are e&s;teemed a rare di&s;h when properly dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the north-we&s;t part of this Lake, and to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Lake Huron, is a tribe of Indians called Mi&s;&s;i&s;au|ges, who&s;e town is denominated Toronto, from the lake on which it lies; but they are not very numerous. The country about Lake Ontario, e&s;pecially the more north and ea&s;tern parts, is compo&s;ed of good land, and in time may make very flouri&s;hing &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>The Oniada Lake, &s;ituated near the head of the Ri|ver O&s;wego, receives the waters of Wood-Creek, which takes its ri&s;e not far from the Mohawk's River. The&s;e two lie &s;o adjacent to each other, that a junction is ef|fected by &s;luices at Fort Stanwix, about twelve miles
<PB N="87" REF="021728_0101_0FB532B457BAEBB0">
from the mouth of the former. This lake is about thirty miles long from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and near fifteen broad. The country around it belongs to the Oniada Indians.</P>
<P>Lake Champlain, the next in &s;ize to Lake Ontario, and which lies nearly ea&s;t from it, is about eighty miles in length, north and &s;outh, and in its broade&s;t part four|teen. It is well &s;tored with fi&s;h, and the lands that lie on all the borders of it, or about its rivers, very good.</P>
<P>Lake George, formerly called by the French, Lake St. Sacrament, lies to the &s;outh-we&s;t of the la&s;t menti|oned lake, and is about thirty-five miles long from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t, but of no great breadth. The coun|try around it is very mountainous, but in the vallies the land is tolerably good.</P>
<P>When the&s;e two lakes were fir&s;t di&s;covered, they were known by no other name than that of the Iroquois Lakes; and I believe in the fir&s;t plans taken of tho&s;e parts, were &s;o denominated. The Indians al&s;o that were then called the Iroquois, are &s;ince known by the name of the Five Mohawk nations, and the Mohawks of Ca|nada. In the late war, the former, which con&s;i&s;t of the Onondagoes, the Oniadas, the Senecas, the Tu&s;carories, and Iroondocks, fought on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h: the latter which are called the Cohnawaghans, and St. Fran|cis Indians, joined the French.</P>
<P>A va&s;t tract of land that lies between the two la&s;t mentioned lakes, and Lake Ontario, was granted in the year 1629, by the Plymouth Company, under a patent they had received from King James I. to Sir Ferdinan|do Gorges, and to Captain John Ma&s;on, the head of that family, afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed from others of the &s;ame name, by the Ma&s;ons of Connecticut. The coun|tries &s;pecified in this grant are &s;aid to begin ten miles from the heads of the rivers that run from the ea&s;t and &s;outh into Lake George and Lake Champlain; and con|tinuing from the&s;e in a direct line we&s;tward, extend to the middle of Lake Ontario; from thence, being bound|ed by the Cataraqui, or river of the Iroquois, they take their cour&s;e to Montreal, as far as Fort Sorrell, which lies at the junction of this river with the Richlieu:
<PB N="88" REF="021728_0102_0FB532B9955EDB10">
and from that point are enclo&s;ed by the la&s;t mentioned river till it returns back to the two lakes.</P>
<P>This immen&s;e &s;pace was granted by the name of the Province of Laccnia, to the afore&s;aid gentlemen, on &s;pe|cified conditions, and under certain penalties; but none of the&s;e amounted, in ca&s;e of omi&s;&s;ion in the fulfilment of any part of them, to forfeiture, a fine only could be exacted.</P>
<P>On account of the continual wars to which the&s;e parts have been &s;ubject, from their &s;ituation between the &s;ettlements of the Engli&s;h, the French, and the In|dians, this grant has been &s;uffered to lie dormant by the real proprietors. Notwith&s;tanding which, &s;everal towns have been &s;ettled &s;ince the late war, on the borders of Lake Champlain, and grants made to different people by the governor of New-York, of part of the&s;e territories, which are now become annexed to that province.</P>
<P>There are a great number of lakes on the north of Canada, between Labrador, Lake Superior, and Hud|&s;on's Bay, but the&s;e are comparatively &s;mall. As they lie out of the track that I pur&s;ued, I &s;hall only give a &s;ummary account of them. The mo&s;t we&s;terly of the&s;e are the Lakes Nipi&s;ing and Tami&s;caming. The fir&s;t lies at the head of the French River, and runs into Lake Huron; the other on the Ottawaw River, which emp|ties it&s;elf into the Cataraqui, at Montreal. The&s;e lakes are each about one hundred miles in circumference.</P>
<P>The next is Lake Mi&s;ta&s;&s;in, on the head of Rupert's River, that falls into James's Bay. This Lake is &s;o ir|regular from the large points of land by which it is in|ter&s;ected on every &s;ide, that it is difficult either to de|&s;cribe its &s;hape, or to a&s;certain its &s;ize. It however ap|pears on the whole to be more than two hundred miles in circumference.</P>
<P>Lake St. John, which is about eighty miles round, and of a circular form, lies on the Saguenay River, di|rectly north of Quebec, and falls into the St. Lawrence, &s;omewhat north-ea&s;t of that city. Lake Manikouagone lies near the head of the Black River, which empties it|&s;elf into the St. Lawrence to the ea&s;tward of the la&s;t mentioned river, near the coa&s;t of Labrador, and is about
<PB N="89" REF="021728_0103_0FB532BB169CA2A0">
&s;ixty miles in circumference. Lake Pertibi, Lake Winck|tagan, Lake Etchelaugon, and Lake Papenouagane, with a number of other &s;mall lakes, lie near the heads of the Bu&s;tard River to the north of the St. Lawrence.</P>
<P>Many others, which it is unnece&s;&s;ary to particularize here, are al&s;o found between the Lakes Huron and On|tario.</P>
<P>The whole of tho&s;e I have enumerated, amounting to upwards of twenty, are within the limits of Canada; and from this account it might be deduced, that the northern parts of North-America, through the&s;e nume|rous inland &s;eas, contain a greater quantity of water than any other quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>In October 1768 I arrived at Bo&s;ton, having been ab|&s;ent from it on this expedition two years and five months, and during that time travelled near &s;even thou&s;and miles. From thence, as &s;oon as I had properly dige&s;ted my Journal and Charts, I &s;et out for England, to commu|nicate the di&s;coveries I had made, and to render them beneficial to the kingdom. But the pro&s;ecution of my plans for reaping the&s;e advantages have hitherto been ob|&s;tructed by the unhappy divi&s;ions that have been foment|ed between Great Britain and the Colonies by their mu|tual enemies. Should peace once more be re&s;tored, I doubt not but that the countries I have de&s;cribed will prove a more abundant &s;ource of riches to this nation, than either its Ea&s;t or We&s;t-Indian &s;ettlements; and I &s;hall not only pride my&s;elf, but &s;incerely rejoice in being the means of pointing out to it &s;o valuable an acqui&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude the account of my exten&s;ive travels, without expre&s;&s;ing my gratitude to that beneficent Being who invi&s;ibly protected me through tho&s;e perils which unavoidably attend &s;o long a tour among fierce and un|tutored &s;avages.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time let me not be accu&s;ed of vanity or pre&s;umption, if I declare that the motives alledged in the introduction of this work, were not the only ones that induced me to engage in this arduous undertaking. My views were not &s;olely confined to the advantages that might accrue either to my&s;elf, or the community to
<PB N="90" REF="021728_0104_0FB532BED711BB30">
which I belonged; but nobler purpo&s;es contributed prin|cipally to urge me on.</P>
<P>The confined &s;tate, both with regard to civil and re|ligious improvements, in which &s;o many of my fellow creatures remained, arou&s;ed within my bo&s;om an irre&s;i&s;ti|ble inclination to explore the almo&s;t unknown regions which they inhabited; and as a preparatory &s;tep towards the introduction of more poli&s;hed manners, and more hu|mane &s;entiments, to gain a knowledge of their language, cu&s;toms, and principles.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s that the little benefit too many of the In|dian nations have hitherto received from their intercour&s;e with tho&s;e who denominate them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, did not tend to encourage my charitable purpo&s;es; yet as ma|ny, though not the generality, might receive &s;ome benefit from the introduction among them of the polity and re|ligion of the Europeans, without retaining only the er|rors or vices that from the depravity and perver&s;ion of their profe&s;&s;ors are unhappily attendant on the&s;e, I de|termined to per&s;evere.</P>
<P>Nor could I flatter my&s;elf that I &s;hould be able to ac|compli&s;h alone this great de&s;ign; however, I was willing to contribute as much as lay in my power towards it. In all public undertakings would every one do this, and furni&s;h with alacrity his particular &s;hare towards it, what &s;tupendous works might not be completed.</P>
<P>It is true that the Indians are not without &s;ome &s;en&s;e of religion, and &s;uch as proves that they wor&s;hip the Great Creator, with a degree of purity unknown to na|tions who have greater opportunities of improvement; but their religious principles are far from being &s;o fault|le&s;s as de&s;cribed by a learned writer, or unmixed with opinions and ceremonies that greatly le&s;&s;en their excel|lency in this point. So that could the doctrines of ge|nuine and vital Chri&s;tianity be introduced among them, pure and untainted, as it flowed from the lips of its Di|vine In&s;titutor, it would certainly tend to clear away that &s;uper&s;titious or idolatrous dro&s;s by which the ration|ality of their religious tenets are ob&s;cured. Its mild and benificent precepts would likewi&s;e conduce to &s;often
<PB N="91" REF="021728_0105_0FB532C2399E1F40">
their implacable di&s;po&s;itions, and to refine their &s;avage manners; an event mo&s;t de&s;irable; and happy &s;hall I e&s;teem my&s;elf if this publication &s;hall prove the means of pointing out the path by which &s;alutary in&s;tructions may be conveyed to them, and the conver&s;ion, though but of a few, be the con&s;equence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Of their Origin.</HEAD>
<P>THE means by which America received its fir&s;t in|habitants, have, &s;ince the time of its di&s;covery by the Europeans, been the &s;ubject of numberle&s;s di&s;|qui&s;itions. Was I to endeavor to collect the different opinions and rea&s;onings on the various writers that have taken up the pen in defence of their conjectures, the enu|meration would much exceed the bounds I have pre&s;crib|ed my&s;elf, and oblige me to be le&s;s explicit on points of greater moment.</P>
<P>From the ob&s;curity in which this debate is enveloped, through the total di&s;u&s;e of letters among every nation of Indians on this exten&s;ive continent, and the uncertainty of oral tradition at the di&s;tance of &s;o many ages, I fear, that even, after the mo&s;t minute inve&s;tigation, we &s;hall not be able to &s;ettle it with any great degree of certainty. And this apprehen&s;ion will receive additional force, when it is con&s;idered that the diver&s;ity of language, which is
<PB N="94" REF="021728_0107_0FB532C8970BE700">
apparently di&s;tinct between mo&s;t of the Indians, tends to a&s;certain that this population was not effected from one particular country, but from &s;everal neighboring ones, and completed at different periods.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the hi&s;torians or travellers that have treated on the American Aborigines, di&s;agree in their &s;entiments relative to them. Many of the ancients are &s;uppo&s;ed to have known that this quarter of the globe not only ex|i&s;ted, but al&s;o that it was inhabited. Plato in his Ti|maeus has a&s;&s;erted, that beyond the i&s;land which he calls Atalantis, and which according to his de&s;cription was &s;i|tuated in the We&s;tern Ocean, there were a great number of other i&s;lands, and behind tho&s;e a va&s;t continent.</P>
<P>Oviedo, a celebrated Spani&s;h author of a much later date, has made no &s;cruple to affirm that the Antille<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are the famous He&s;perides &s;o often mentioned by the po|ets; which are at length re&s;tored to the kings of Spain, the de&s;cendants of king He&s;perus, who lived upwards of three thou&s;and years ago, and from whom the&s;e i&s;lands received their name.</P>
<P>Two other Spaniards, the one, Father Gregorio Gar|cia, a Dominican, the other, Father Jo&s;eph De Aco&s;ta, a Je&s;uit, have written on the origin of the Americans.</P>
<P>The former, who had been employed in the mi&s;&s;ions of Mexico and Peru, endeavored to prove from the tra|ditions of the Mexicans, Peruvians, and others, which he received on the &s;pot, and from the variety of charac|ters, cu&s;toms, languages, and religion ob&s;ervable in the different countries of the New World, that different na|tions had contributed to the peopling of it.</P>
<P>The latter, Father De Aco&s;ta, in his examination of the means by which the fir&s;t Indians of America might have found a pa&s;&s;age to that continent, di&s;credits the the conclu&s;ions of tho&s;e who have &s;uppo&s;ed it to be by &s;ea, becau&s;e no ancient author has made mention of the compa&s;s: and concludes, that it mu&s;t be either by the north of A&s;ia and Europe, which adjoin to each other, or by tho&s;e regions that lie to the &s;outhward of the Straits of Magellan. He al&s;o rejects the a&s;&s;ertions of &s;uch as have advanced that it was peopled by the He|brews.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="021728_0108_0FB532CD733FA8D0">John De La&euml;t, a Flemi&s;h writer, has controverted the opinions of the&s;e Spani&s;h fathers, and of many others who have written on the &s;ame &s;ubject. The hypothe&s;is he endeavors to e&s;tabli&s;h, is, that America was certainly peopled by the Scythians or Tartars: and that the tran&s;|migration of the&s;e people happened &s;oon after the di&s;|per&s;ion of Noah's grand&s;ons. He undertakes to &s;how, that the mo&s;t northern, Americans have a greater re&s;em|blance, not only in the features of their countenances, but al&s;o in their complexion and manner of living, to the Scythians, Tartars, and Samoeides, than to any other nations.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to Grotius, who had a&s;&s;erted that &s;ome of the Norwegians pa&s;&s;ed into America by way of Green|land, and over a va&s;t continent, he &s;ays, that it is well known that Greenland was not di&s;covered till the year 964; and both Gomera and Herrera inform us that the Chichimeques were &s;ettled on the Lake of Mexico in 721. He adds, that the&s;e &s;avages, according to the uni|form tradition of the Mexicans who di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, came from the country &s;ince called New Mexico, and from the neighborhood of California; con&s;equently North-America mu&s;t have been inhabited many ages before it could receive any inhabitants from Norway by way of Greenland.</P>
<P>It is no le&s;s certain, he ob&s;erves, that the real Mexi|cans founded their empire in 902, after having &s;ubdued the Chichimeques, the Otomias, and other barbarous na|tions, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country round the Lake of Mexico, and each of whom &s;poke a language peculiar to them&s;elves. The real Mexicans are likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed to come from &s;ome of the countries that lie near California, and that they performed their journey for the mo&s;t part by land; of cour&s;e they could not come from Norway.</P>
<P>De La&euml;t further adds, that though &s;ome of the in|habitants of North America may have entered it from the north-we&s;t, yet, as it is related by Pliny, and &s;ome other writers, that on many of the i&s;lands near the we&s;t|ern coa&s;t of Africa, particularly on the Canaries, &s;ome ancient edifices were &s;een, it is highly probable from
<PB N="96" REF="021728_0109_0FB532CE956AA2B0">
their being now de&s;erted, that the inhabitants may have pa&s;&s;ed over to America; the pa&s;&s;age being neither long nor difficult. This migration, according to the calcu|lation of tho&s;e authors, mu&s;t have happened more than two thou&s;and years ago, at a time when the Spaniards were much troubled by the Carthaginians; from whom having obtained a knowledge of navigation, and the con|&s;truction of &s;hips, they might have retired to the Antille<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, by the way of the we&s;tern i&s;les, which were exactly half way on their voyage.</P>
<P>He thinks al&s;o that Great Britain, Ireland, and the Orcades were extremely proper to admit of a &s;imilar conjecture. As a proof, he in&s;erts the following pa&s;&s;age from the hi&s;tory of Wales, written by Dr. David Powel, in the year 1170.</P>
<P>This hi&s;torian &s;ays, that Madoc, one of the &s;ons of Prince Owen Gwynnith, being di&s;gu&s;ted at the civil wars which broke out between his brothers, after the death of their father, fitted out &s;everal ve&s;&s;els, and having pro|vided them with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for a long voyage, went in que&s;t of new lands to the we&s;tward of Ireland; there he di&s;covered very fertile countries, but de&s;titute of inhabitants; when landing part of his people, he re|turned to Britain, where he rai&s;ed new levies, and af|terwards tran&s;ported them to his colony.</P>
<P>The Flemi&s;h author then returns to the Scythians, between whom and the Americans he draws a parallel. He ob&s;erves that &s;everal nations of them to the north of the Ca&s;pian Sea, led a wandering life; which, as well as many other of their cu&s;toms, and way of living, agrees in many circum&s;tances with the Indians of Ame|rica. And though the re&s;emblances are not ab&s;olutely perfect, yet the emigrants, even before they left their own country, differed from each other, and went not by the &s;ame name. Their change of abode effected what remained.</P>
<P>He further &s;ays, that a &s;imilar likene&s;s exi&s;ts between &s;everal American nations, and the Samoeides who are &s;ettled, according to the Ru&s;&s;ian accounts, on the great River Oby. And it is more natural, continues he, to &s;uppo&s;e that Colonies of the&s;e nations pa&s;&s;ed over to
<PB N="97" REF="021728_0110_0FB532DB30550C00">
America by cro&s;&s;ing the icy &s;ea on their &s;ledges, than for the Norwegians to travel all the way Grotius has marked out for them.</P>
<P>This writer makes many other remarks that are equal|ly &s;en&s;ible, and which appear to be ju&s;t; but he inter|mixes with the&s;e, &s;ome that are not &s;o well founded.</P>
<P>Emanuel de Moraez, a Portugue&s;e, in his hi&s;tory of Brazil, a&s;&s;erts, that America has been wholly peopled by the Carthaginians and I&s;raelites. He brings as a proof of this a&s;&s;ertion, the di&s;coveries the former are known to have made at a great di&s;tance beyond the coa&s;t of Africa. The progre&s;s of which being put a &s;top to by the &s;enate of Carthage, tho&s;e who happened to be then in the newly di&s;covered countries, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> off from all communication with their countrymen, and de&s;titute of many nece&s;&s;aries of life, fell into a &s;tate of barbari&s;m. As to the I&s;raelites, this author thinks that nothing but circumci&s;ion is wanted in order to con&s;titute a perfect re&s;emblance between them and the Brazilians.</P>
<P>George De Hornn, a learned Dutchman, has likewi&s;e written on this &s;ubject. He &s;ets out with declaring, that he dots not believe it po&s;&s;ible America could have been peopled before the flood, con&s;idering the &s;hort &s;pace of time which elap&s;ed between the creation of the world and that memorable event. In the next place he lays it down as a principle, that after the deluge, men and other terre&s;trial animals penetrated into that country both by &s;ea and by land; &s;ome through accident, and &s;ome from a formed de&s;ign. That birds got thither by flight; which they were enabled to do by re&s;ting on the rocks and i&s;lands that are &s;cattered about in the Ocean.</P>
<P>He further ob&s;erves, that wild bea&s;ts may have found a free pa&s;&s;age by land; and that if we do not meet with hor&s;es or cattle (to which he might have added elephants, camels, rhinoceros, and bea&s;ts of many other kinds) it is becau&s;e tho&s;e nations that pa&s;&s;ed thither, were either not acquainted with their u&s;e, or had no convenience to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>Having totally excluded many nations that others have admitted as the probable fir&s;t &s;ettlers of America, for which he gives &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons, he &s;uppo&s;es that it be|gan
<PB N="98" REF="021728_0111_0FB532E65EB144F0">
to be peopled by the north; and maintains, that the primitive colonies &s;pread them&s;elves by the means of the i&s;thmus of Panama through the whole extent of the continent.</P>
<P>He believes that the fir&s;t founders of the Indian Co|lonies were Scythians. That the Phoenicians and Car|thaginians afterwards got footing in America acro&s;s the Atlantic Ocean, and the Chine&s;e by way of the Pacific. And that other nations might from time to time have landed there by one or other of the&s;e ways, or might po&s;&s;ibly have been thrown on the coa&s;t by tempe&s;ts: &s;ince, through the whole extent of that Continent, both in its northern and &s;outhern parts, we meet with un|doubted marks of a mixture of the northern nations with tho&s;e who have come from other places. And la&s;t|ly, that &s;ome Jews and Chri&s;tians might have been car|ried there by &s;uch like events, but that this mu&s;t have happened at a time when the whole of the New World was already peopled.</P>
<P>After all, he acknowledges that great difficulties at|tend the determination of the que&s;tion. The&s;e, he &s;ays, are occa&s;ioned in the fir&s;t place by the imperfect know|ledge we have of the extremities of the globe, towards the north and &s;outh pole; and in the next place to the havoc which the Spaniards, the fir&s;t di&s;coverers of the New World, made among its mo&s;t ancient monuments, as witne&s;s the great double road betwixt Quito and Cuzco, an undertaking &s;o &s;tupendous, that even the mo&s;t magnificent of tho&s;e executed by the Romans, cannot be compared to it.</P>
<P>He &s;uppo&s;es al&s;o another migration of the Phoenicians, than tho&s;e already mentioned, to have taken place; and this was during a three years voyage made by the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|an fleet in the &s;ervice of King Solomon. He a&s;&s;erts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the authority of Jo&s;ephus, that the port at which this embarkation was made, lay in the Mediterranean. The fleet, he adds, went in que&s;t of elephants' teeth and peacocks, to the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa, which is Tar|&s;hi&s;h; then to Ophir for gold, which is Hait&eacute;, or the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola; and in the latter opinion he is
<PB N="99" REF="021728_0112_0FB532EF7B2E8728">
&s;upported by Columbus, who, when he di&s;covered that i&s;land, thought he could trace the furnaces in which the gold was refined.</P>
<P>To the&s;e migrations which preceded the Chri&s;tian aera, he adds many others of a later date, from different na|tions, but the&s;e I have not time to enumerate. For the &s;ame rea&s;on I am obliged to pa&s;s over numberle&s;s writers on this &s;ubject; and &s;hall content my&s;elf with on|ly giving the &s;entiments of two or three more.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is Pierre De Charlevoix, a French|man, who, in his journal of a voyage to North-Ameri|ca, made &s;o lately as the year 1720, has recapitulated the opinions of a variety of authors on this head, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which he has &s;ubjoined his own conjectures. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> latter cannot without &s;ome difficulty be extracted, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are &s;o interwoven with the pa&s;&s;ages he has quoted, that it requires much attention to di&s;criminate them.</P>
<P>He &s;eems to allow that America might have received its fir&s;t inhabitants from Tartary and Hyrcania. This he confirms, by ob&s;erving that the lions and tigers which are found in the former, mu&s;t have come from tho&s;e countries, and who&s;e pa&s;&s;age &s;erves for a proof that the two hemi&s;pheres join to the northward of A&s;ia. He then draws a corroboration of this argument, from a &s;tory he &s;ays he has often heard related by Father Grollon, a French Je&s;uit, as an undoubted matter of fact.</P>
<P>This father after having laboured &s;ome time in the mi&s;&s;ions of New France, pa&s;&s;ed over to tho&s;e of China. One day as he was travelling in Tartary, he met a Hu|ron woman whom he had formerly known in Canada. He a&s;ked her by what adventure &s;he had been carried in|to a country &s;o di&s;tant from her own. She made an|&s;wer, that having been taken in war, &s;he had been con|ducted from nation to nation, till &s;he had reached the place at which &s;he then was.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Charlevoix &s;ays further, that he had been a&s;&s;ured another Je&s;uit, pa&s;&s;ing through Nantz, in his return from China, had related much &s;uch another af|fair of a Spani&s;h woman from Florida. She al&s;o had been taken by certain Indians, and given to tho&s;e of a
<PB N="100" REF="021728_0113_0FB532F056B10948">
more di&s;tant country; and by the&s;e again to another nation, till having thus been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pa&s;&s;ed from country to country, and travelled through regions ex|tremely cold, &s;he at la&s;t found her&s;elf in Tartary. Here &s;he had married a Tartar, who had attended the con|querors in China, where &s;he was then &s;ettled.</P>
<P>He acknowledges as an allay to the probability of the&s;e &s;tories, that tho&s;e who had &s;ailed farthe&s;t to the ea&s;tward of A&s;ia, by pur&s;uing the Coa&s;t of Je&s;&s;o or Kam&s;chatka, have pretended that they had perceived the extremity of this continent; and from thence have concluded that there could not po&s;&s;ibly be any communi|cation by land. But he adds that Francis Guella, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">niard, is &s;aid to have a&s;&s;erted, that this &s;eparation is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> more than a &s;trait, about one hundred miles over, and that &s;ome late voyages of the Japane&s;e give grounds to think that this &s;trait is only a bay, above which there is pa&s;&s;age over land.</P>
<P>He goes on to ob&s;erve, that though there are few wild bea&s;ts to be met with in North-America, except a kind of tigers without &s;pots, which are found in the country of the Iroquoi&s;e, yet towards the tropics there are lions and real tigers, which, notwith&s;tanding, might have come from Hyrcania and Tartary; for as by ad|vancing gradually &s;outhward they met with climates more agreeable to their natures, they have in time aban|doned the northern countries.</P>
<P>He quotes both Solinus and Pliny to prove that the Scythian Anthropophagi once depopulated a great ex|tent of country, as far as the promontory Tabin; and al&s;o an author of later date, Mark Pol, a Venetian, who, he &s;ays, tells us, that to the north-ea&s;t of China and Tartary there are va&s;t uninhabited countries, which might be &s;ufficient to confirm any conjectures con|cerning the retreat of a great number of Scythians into America.</P>
<P>To this he adds, that we find in the ancients the names of &s;ome of the&s;e nations. Pliny &s;peaks of the Tabians; Solinus mentions the Apuleans, who had for neighbors the Ma&s;&s;agetes, whom Pliny &s;ince a&s;&s;ures us to have entirely di&s;appeared. Ammianus Marcellinus ex|pre&s;sly
<PB N="101" REF="021728_0114_0FB532F5C7E80088">
tells us, that the fear of the Anthrop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> obliged &s;everal of the inhabitants of tho&s;e cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> take refuge el&s;ewhere. From all the&s;e authorities Mon+&s;ieur Charlevoix concludes, that there is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to conjecture that more than one nation in America had a Scythian or Tartarian original.</P>
<P>He fini&s;hes his remarks on the authors he has quoted, by the following ob&s;ervations: It appears to me that this controver&s;y may be reduced to the two following articles; fir&s;t, how the new world might have been peo|pled; and &s;econdly, by whom, and by what means it has been peopled.</P>
<P>Nothing, he a&s;&s;erts, may be more ea&s;ily an&s;wered than the fir&s;t. America might have been peopled as the three other parts of the world have been. Many difficulties have been formed on this &s;ubject, which have been deem|ed in&s;olvable, but which are far from being &s;o. The inhabitants of both hemi&s;pheres are certainly the de&s;cend|ants of the &s;ame father; the common parent of man|kind received an expre&s;s command from Heaven to peo|ple the whole world, and accordingly it has been peo|pled.</P>
<P>To bring this about it was nece&s;&s;ary to overcome all difficulties that lay in the way, and they have been got over. Were the&s;e difficulties greater with re&s;pect to peopling the extremities of A&s;ia, Africa, and Europe, or the tran&s;porting men into the i&s;lands which lie at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from tho&s;e continents, than to pa&s;s over into America? certainly not.</P>
<P>Navigation, which has arrived at &s;o great perfection within the&s;e three or four centuries, might po&s;&s;ibly have been more perfect in tho&s;e early ages than at this day. Who can believe that Noah and his immediate de&s;cend|ants knew le&s;s of this art than we do? That the builder and pilot of the large&s;t &s;hip that ever was, a &s;hip that was formed to traver&s;e an unbounded ocean, and had &s;o many &s;hoals and quick-&s;ands to gaurd again&s;t, &s;hould be ignorant of, or &s;hould not have communicated to tho&s;e of his de&s;cendants who &s;urvived him, and by who&s;e means he was to execute the order of the Great Crea|tor; I &s;ay, who can believe he &s;hould not have commu|nicated
<PB N="102" REF="021728_0115_0FB532FB6FA91C60">
to them the art of &s;ailing upon an ocean, which was not only mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> calm and pacific, but at the &s;ame time confined within its ancient limits?</P>
<P>Admitting this, how ea&s;y is it to pa&s;s, exclu&s;ive of the pa&s;&s;age already de&s;cribed, by land from the coa&s;t of Afri|ca to Brazil, from the Canaries to the We&s;tern I&s;lands, and from them to the Antilles? From the Briti&s;h I&s;les, or the coa&s;t of France, to Newfoundland, the pa&s;&s;age is neither long nor difficult; I might &s;ay as much of that from China to Japan; from Japan, or the Philippines, to the I&s;les Mariannes; and from thence to Mexico.</P>
<P>There are i&s;lands at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the continent of A&s;ia, where we have not been &s;urpri&s;ed to find inhabitants, why then &s;hould we wonder to meet with people in America? Nor can it be imagined that the grand&s;ons of Noah, when they were obliged to &s;e|parate, and &s;pread them&s;elves in conformity to the de|&s;igns of God, over the whole earth, &s;hould find it ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to people almo&s;t one half of it.</P>
<P>I have been more copious in my extracts from this author than I intended, as his rea&s;ons appear to be &s;olid, and many of his ob&s;ervations ju&s;t. From this encomi|um, however, I mu&s;t exclude the &s;tories he has intro|duced of the Huron and Floridan women, which I think I might venture to pronounce fabulous.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, to give my readers a more com|prehen&s;ive view of Mon&s;ieur Charlevoix's di&s;&s;ertation, the method he propo&s;es to come at the truth of what we are in &s;earch of.</P>
<P>The only means by which this can be done, he &s;ays, is by comparing the languages of the Americans with the different nations, from whence we might &s;uppo&s;e they have peregrinated. If we compare the former with tho&s;e words that are con&s;idered as primitives, it might po&s;&s;ibly &s;et us upon &s;ome happy di&s;covery. And this way of a&s;cending to the original of nations, which is by far the lea&s;t equivocal, is not &s;o difficult as might be imagined. We have had, and &s;till have, travellers and mi&s;&s;ionaries who have attained the languages that are &s;poken in all the provinces of the new world; it would only be nece&s;|&s;ary to make a collection of their grammars and vocabu|laries,
<PB N="103" REF="021728_0116_0FB532FC559BCCA0">
and to collate them with the dead and living languages of the old world, that pa&s;s for originals, and the &s;imilarity might ea&s;ily be traced. Even the dif|ferent dialects, in &s;pite of the alterations they have un|dergone, &s;till retain enough of the mother tongue to furni&s;h con&s;iderable lights.</P>
<P>Any enquiry into the manners, cu&s;toms, religion, or traditions of the Americans, in order to di&s;cover by that means their origin, he thinks would prove fallacious. A di&s;qui&s;ition of that kind, he ob&s;erves, is only capa|ble of producing a fal&s;e light, more likely to dazzle, and to make us wander from the right path, than to lead us with certainty to the point propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Ancient traditions are effaced from the minds of &s;uch as either have not, or for &s;everal ages have been without tho&s;e helps that are nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve them. And in this &s;ituation is full one half of the world. New events, and a new arrangement of things, give ri&s;e to new tra|ditions, which efface the former, and are them&s;elves effaced in turn. After one or two centuries have pa&s;&s;ed, there no longer remain any traces of the fir&s;t traditi|ons; and thus we are involved in a &s;tate of uncertainty.</P>
<P>He concludes with the following remarks, among many others. Unfore&s;een accidents, tempe&s;ts, and &s;hip|wrecks, have certainly contributed to people every habit|able part of the world: and ought we to wonder after this, at perceiving certain re&s;emblances, both of per|&s;ons and manners between nations that are mo&s;t remote from each other, when we find &s;uch a difference between tho&s;e that border on one another? As we are de&s;titute of hi&s;torical monuments, there is nothing, I repeat it, but a knowledge of the primitive languages that is ca|pable of throwing any light upon the&s;e clouds of impene|trable darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>By this enquiry we &s;hould at lea&s;t be &s;atisfied, among that prodigious number of various nations inhabiting America, and differing &s;o much in languages from each other, which are tho&s;e who make u&s;e of words totally and entirely different from tho&s;e of the old world, and who con&s;equently mu&s;t be reckoned to have pa&s;&s;ed over to America in the earlie&s;t ages, and tho&s;e, who,
<PB REF="021728_0117_0FB5330847E57048">
from the analogy of their language with &s;uch as are at pre&s;ent u&s;ed in the three other parts of the globe, leave room to judge that their migration has been more re|cent, and which ought to be attributed to &s;hipwrecks, or to &s;ome accident &s;imilar to tho&s;e which have been &s;poken of in the cour&s;e of this treati&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add the opinion of one author more, be|fore I give my own &s;entiments on the &s;ubject, and that is of James Adair, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who re&s;ided forty years among the Indians, and publi&s;hed the hi&s;tory of them in the year 1772. In his learned and &s;y&s;tematical hi&s;tory of tho&s;e nations, inhabiting the we&s;tern parts of the mo&s;t &s;outhern of the American colonies; this gentleman without he&s;itation pronounces that the American Abori|gines are de&s;cended from the I&s;raelites, either whil&s;t they were a maritime power, or &s;oon after their general captivity.</P>
<P>This de&s;cent he endeavors to prove from their religi|ous rites, their civil and martial cu&s;toms, their marria|ges, their funeral ceremonies, their manners, language, traditions, and from a variety of other particulars. And &s;o complete is his conviction on this head, that he fan|cies he finds a perfect and indi&s;putable &s;imilitude in each. Through all the&s;e I have not time to follow him, and &s;hall therefore only give a few extracts to &s;how on what foundation he builds his conjectures, and what degree of credit he is entitled to on this point.</P>
<P>He begins with ob&s;erving, that though &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed the Americans to be de&s;cended from the Chi|ne&s;e, yet neither their religion, laws, or cu&s;toms agree in the lea&s;t with tho&s;e of the Chine&s;e; which &s;ufficient|ly proves that they are not of this line. Be&s;ides, as our be&s;t &s;hips are now almo&s;t half a year in &s;ailing for China (our author does not here recollect that this is from a high northern latitude, acro&s;s the Line, and then back again greatly to the northward of it, and not directly athwart the Pacific Ocean, for only one hundred and eleven degrees) or from thence to Europe, it is very unlikely they &s;hould attempt &s;uch dangerous di&s;coveries, with their &s;uppo&s;ed &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, again&s;t rapid currents, and in dark and &s;ickly Mon&s;oons.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="021728_0118_0FB533126A9C37E8">He further remarks, that this is more particularly improbable, as there is rea&s;on to believe that this na|tion was unacquainted with the u&s;e of the load&s;tone to direct their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>China, he &s;ays, is about eight thou&s;and miles di&s;tant from the American continent, which is twice as far as acro&s;s the Atlantic Ocean. And we are not informed by any ancient writer of their maritime &s;kill, or &s;o much as any inclination that way, be&s;ides &s;mall coa&s;ting voy|ages. The winds blow likewi&s;e, with little variation from ea&s;t to we&s;t within the latitudes thirty and odd, north and &s;outh, and therefore the&s;e could not drive them on the American coa&s;t, it lying directly contrary to &s;uch a cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Neither could per&s;ons, according to this writer's ac|count, &s;ail to America from the north by the way of Tartary or Ancient Scythia; that, from its &s;ituation, never having been or can be a maritime power; and it is utterly impracticable, he &s;ays, for any to come to America by &s;ea from that quarter. Be&s;ides, the remaining traces of their religious ceremonies, and civil and martial cu&s;|toms, are quite oppo&s;ite to the like ve&s;tiges of the Old Scythians.</P>
<P>Even in the moderate northern climates there is not to be &s;een the lea&s;t trace of any ancient &s;tately build|ings, or of any thick &s;ettlements, as are &s;aid to remain in the le&s;s healthy regions of Peru and Mexico. And &s;everal of the Indian nations a&s;&s;ure us, that they cro&s;&s;ed the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi before they made their pre&s;ent northern &s;ettlements; which, connected with the former argu|ments, he concludes will &s;ufficiently explode that weak opinion of the American Aborigines being lineally de|&s;cended from the Tartars or ancient Scythians.</P>
<P>Mr. Adair's rea&s;ons for &s;uppo&s;ing that the Americans derive their origin from the Jews are,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, becau&s;e they are divided into tribes, and have chiefs over them as the I&s;raelites had.</P>
<P>Secondly, becau&s;e, as by a &s;trict, permanent, divine precept, the Hebrew nation were ordered to wor&s;hip, at Jeru&s;alem, Jehovah the true and living God, &s;o do the Indians, &s;tiling him Yohewah. The ancient Heathens,
<PB N="106" REF="021728_0119_0FB5331D70C4F470">
he adds, it is well known wor&s;hipped a plurality of gods, but the Indians pay their religious devoirs to the Great, beneficent, &s;upreme, holy Spirit of Fire, who re&s;ides, as they think, above the clouds, and on earth al&s;o with unpolluted people. They pay no adoration to images, or to dead per&s;ons, neither to the cele&s;tial luminaries, to evil &s;pirits, nor to any created beings whatever.</P>
<P>Thirdly, becau&s;e, agreeable to the theocracy or di|vine government of I&s;arel, the Indians think the Deity to be the immediate head of their &s;tate.</P>
<P>Fourthly, becau&s;e, as the Jews believe in the mini|&s;tration of angels, the Indians al&s;o believe that the high|er regions are inhabited by good &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Fifthly, becau&s;e the Indian language and dialects ap|pear to have the very idiom and genius of the Hebrew. Their words and &s;entences being expre&s;&s;ive, conci&s;e, emphatical, &s;onorous, and bold; and often, both in let|ters, and &s;ignification, are &s;ynonimous with the Hebrew language.</P>
<P>Sixthly, becau&s;e they count their time after the man|ner of the Hebrews.</P>
<P>Seventhly, becau&s;e in conformity to, or after the manner of the Jews, they have their prophets, high-prie&s;ts, and other religious orders.</P>
<P>Eighthly, becau&s;e their fe&s;tivals, fa&s;ts, and religious rites have a great re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the Hebrews.</P>
<P>Ninthly, becau&s;e the Indians, before they go to war, have many preparatory ceremonies of purification and fa&s;ting, like what is recorded of the I&s;raelites.</P>
<P>Tenthly, becau&s;e the &s;ame ta&s;te for ornaments, and the &s;ame kind, are made u&s;e of by the Indians, as by the Hebrews.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other arguments of a &s;imilar nature, Mr. Adair brings in &s;upport of his favourite &s;y&s;tem; but I &s;hould imagine, that if the Indians are really de|rived from the Hebrews, among their religious ceremo|nies, on which he chiefly &s;eems to build his hypothe&s;is, the principal, that of circumci&s;ion, would never have been laid a&s;ide, and its very remembrance obliterated.</P>
<P>Thus numerous and diver&s;e are the opinions of tho&s;e who have hitherto written on this &s;ubject! I &s;hall not,
<PB N="107" REF="021728_0120_0FB5332E590F15B8">
however, either endeavor to reconcile them, or to point out the errors of each, but proceed to give my own &s;entiments on the origin of the Americans; which are founded on conclu&s;ions drawn from the mo&s;t rational ar|guments of the writers I have mentioned, and from my own ob&s;ervations; the con&s;i&s;tency of the&s;e I &s;hall leave to the judgment of my Readers.</P>
<P>The better to introduce my conjectures on this head, it is nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to a&s;certain the di&s;tances between America and tho&s;e parts of the habitable globe that ap|proach neare&s;t to it.</P>
<P>The Continent of America, as far as we can judge from all the re&s;earches that have been made near the poles, appears to be entirely &s;eparated from the other quarters of the world. That part of Europe which approaches neare&s;t to it, is the coa&s;t of Greenland, lying in about &s;eventy degrees of north latitude: and which reaches within twelve degrees of the coa&s;t of Labrador, &s;ituated on the north-ea&s;t borders of this continent. The coa&s;t of Guinea is the neare&s;t part of Africa; which lies about eighteen hundred and &s;ixty miles north-ea&s;t from the Brazils. The mo&s;t ea&s;tern coa&s;t of A&s;ia, which extends to the Korean Sea on the north of China, projects north-ea&s;t through ea&s;tern Tartary and Kam|&s;chatka to Siberia, in about &s;ixty degrees of north la|titude. Towards which the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of America, from California to the Straits of Anniau, extend nearly north-we&s;t, and lie in about forty-&s;ix degrees of the &s;ame latitude.</P>
<P>Whether the Continent of America &s;tretches any far|ther north than the&s;e &s;traits, and joins to the ea&s;tern parts of A&s;ia, agreeable to what has been a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome of the writers I have quoted, or whether the lands that have been di&s;covered in the intermediate parts are only an archipelago of i&s;lands, vergi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> towards the oppo&s;ite continent, is not yet a&s;certained.</P>
<P>It being, however, certain that there are many con|&s;iderable i&s;lands which lie between the extremities of A&s;ia and America, viz. Japan, Je&s;o or Jed&s;o, Gama's Land, Behring's I&s;le, with many others di&s;covered by T&s;chirikow, and be&s;ides the&s;e, from fifty degrees north
<PB N="108" REF="021728_0121_0FB5334E400124F8">
there appearing to be a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands that reach as far as Siberia, it is probable from their proximity to America, that it received its fir&s;t inhabitants from them.</P>
<P>This conclu&s;ion is the mo&s;t rational I am able to draw, &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;ince the Aborigines got footing on this continent, no extraordinary or &s;udden change in the po&s;ition or &s;urface of it has taken place, from in|undations, earthquakes, or any revolutions of the earth that we are at pre&s;ent unacquainted with.</P>
<P>To me it appears highly improbable that it &s;hould have been peopled from different quarters, acro&s;s the Ocean, as others have a&s;&s;erted. From the &s;ize of the &s;hips made u&s;e of in tho&s;e early ages, and the want of the compa&s;s, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that any maritime nation would by choice venture over the unfathomable ocean, in &s;earch of di&s;tant continents. Had this how|ever been attempted, or had America been fir&s;t acci|dentally peopled from &s;hips freighted with pa&s;&s;engers of both &s;exes, which were driven by &s;trong ea&s;terly winds acro&s;s the Atlantic, the&s;e &s;ettlers mu&s;t have retained &s;ome traces of the language of the country from whence they migrated; and this &s;ince the di&s;covery of it by the Europeans mu&s;t have been made out. It al&s;o appears extraordinary that &s;everal of the&s;e accidental migrations, as allowed by &s;ome, and the&s;e from different parts, &s;hould have taken place.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, after the mo&s;t critical enquiries, and the mature&s;t deliberation, I am of opinion, that America received its fir&s;t inhabitants from the north-ea&s;t, by way of the great archipelago ju&s;t mentioned, and from the&s;e alone. But this might have been ef|fected at different times, and from vario<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">: from Tartary, China, Japan, or Kam&s;chatka, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">abitants of the&s;e places re&s;embling each other in color, features, and &s;hape; and who, before &s;ome of them acquired a knowledge of the arts and &s;ciences, might have like|wi&s;e re&s;embled each other in their manners, cu&s;toms, re|ligion, and language.</P>
<P>The only difference between the Chine&s;e nation and the Tartars lies in the cultivated &s;tate of the one, and
<PB N="109" REF="021728_0122_0FB5338118C585B0">
the unpoli&s;hed &s;ituation of the others. The former have become a commercial people, and dwell in hou&s;es formed into regular towns and cities; the latter live chiefly in tents, and rove about in different hords, without any fixed abode. Nor can the long and bloody wars the&s;e two nations have been engaged in, exterminate their hereditary &s;imilitude. The pre&s;ent family of the Chine&s;e emperors is of Tartarian extraction; and if they were not &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome claim be&s;ide that of conque&s;t, &s;o numerous a people would &s;carcely &s;it quiet under the dominion of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>It is very evident that &s;ome of the manners and cu&s;|toms of the American Indians re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Tartars; and I make no doubt but that in &s;ome future aera, and this is not a very di&s;tant one, it will be reduced to a certainty, that during &s;ome of the wars between the Tartars and the Chine&s;e, a part of the inhabitants of the northern provinces were driven from their native country, and took refuge in &s;ome of the i&s;les before-mentioned, and from thence found their way into Ame|rica. At different periods each nation might prove victorious, and the conquered by turns fly before their conquerors; and from hence might ari&s;e the &s;imilitude of the Indians to all the&s;e people, and that animo&s;ity which exi&s;ts between &s;o many of their tribes.</P>
<P>It appears plainly to me that a great &s;imilarity be|tween the Indians and Chine&s;e is con&s;picuous in that particular cu&s;tom of &s;having or plucking off the hair, and leaving only a &s;mall tuft on the crown of the head. This mode is &s;aid to have been enjoined by the Tar|tarian emperors on their acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of Chi|na, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">equently is a further proof that this cu&s;tom was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mong the Tartars; to whom as well as the Chine&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Americans might be indebted for it.</P>
<P>Many words al&s;o are u&s;ed both by the Chine&s;e and Indians, which have a re&s;emblance to each other, not only in their &s;ound, but their &s;ignification. The Chine&s;e call a &s;lave, &s;hungo; and the Naudowe&s;&s;ie Indians, who&s;e language from their little intercour&s;e with the Europeans is the lea&s;t corrupted, term a dog, &s;hungu&s;h. The former denominate one &s;pecies of their tea, &s;hou&s;ong;
<PB N="110" REF="021728_0123_0FB53381D9350C78">
the latter call their tobacco, &s;hou&s;a&s;&s;au. Many other of the words u&s;ed by the Indians contain the &s;ylla|bles che, chaw, and chu, after the dialect of the Chi|ne&s;e.</P>
<P>There probably might be found a &s;imilar connection between the language of the Tartars and the American Aborigines, were we as well acquainted with it as we are, from a commercial intercour&s;e, with that of the Chine&s;e.</P>
<P>I am confirmed in the&s;e conjectures, by the accounts of Kam&s;chatka, publi&s;hed a few years ago by order of the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia. The author of which &s;ays, that the &s;ea which divides that penin&s;ula from America is full of i&s;lands; and that the di&s;tance between T&s;chu|kot&s;koi-No&s;s, a promontory which lies at the ea&s;tern extremity of that country, and the coa&s;t of America, is not more than two degrees and a half of a great circle. He further &s;ays, that there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e that A&s;ia and America once joined at this place, as the coa&s;ts of both continents appear to have been bro|ken into capes and bays, which an&s;wer each other; more e&s;pecially as the inhabitants of this part of both re&s;em|ble each other in their per&s;ons, habits, cu&s;toms, and food. Their language, indeed, he ob&s;erves, does not appear to be the &s;ame, but then the inhabitants of each di&s;trict in Kam&s;chatka &s;peak a language as different from each other, as from that &s;poken on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t. The&s;e ob&s;ervations, to which he adds, the &s;imilarity of the boats of the inhabitants of each coa&s;t, and a remark that the natives of this part of America are wholly &s;trangers to wine and tobacco, which he looks upon as a proof that they have as yet had no communication with the natives of Europe, he &s;ays, amoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ttle le&s;s than a demon&s;tration that America was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from this part of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>The limits of my pre&s;ent undertaking will not per|mit me to dwell any longer on this &s;ubject, or to enume|rate any other proofs in favor of my hypothe&s;is. I am however, &s;o thoroughly convinced of the certainty of it, and &s;o de&s;irous have I been to obtain every te&s;timony which can be procured in its &s;upport, that I once made
<PB N="111" REF="021728_0124_0FB53384E79FB128">
an offer to a private &s;ociety of gentlemen, who were curious in &s;uch re&s;earches, and to whom I had com|municated my &s;entiments on this point, that I would un|dertake a journey, on receiving &s;uch &s;upplies as were needful, through the north-ea&s;t parts of Europe and A&s;ia to the interior parts of America, and from thence to England; making, as I proceeded, &s;uch ob&s;ervations both on the languages and manners of the people with whom I &s;hould be conver&s;ant, as might tend to illu&s;trate the doctrine I have here laid down, and to &s;atisfy the curio&s;ity of the learned or inqui&s;itive; but as this pro|po&s;al was judged rather to require a national than a pri|vate &s;upport, it was not carried into execution.</P>
<P>I am happy to find, &s;ince I formed the foregoing conclu&s;ions, that they corre&s;pond with the &s;entiments of that great and learned hi&s;torian, Doctor Robert&s;on; and though with him, I acknowledge that the inve&s;tiga|tion, from its nature, is &s;o ob&s;cure and intricate, that the conjectures I have made can only be con&s;idered as conjectures, and not indi&s;putable conclu&s;ions, yet they carry with them a greater degree of probability than the &s;uppo&s;itions of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert that this continent was peopled from another quarter.</P>
<P>One of the Doctor's quotations from the Journals of Behring and T&s;chirikow, who &s;ailed from Kam&s;chatka, about the year 1741, in que&s;t of the New World, ap|pears to carry great weight with it, and to afford our conclu&s;ions firm &s;upport: <Q>The&s;e commanders having &s;haped their cour&s;e towards the ea&s;t, di&s;covered land, which to them appeared to be part of the American continent; and according to their ob&s;ervations, it &s;eems to be &s;ituated within a few degrees of the north-we&s;t coa&s;t of California. They had there &s;ome intercour&s;e with the inhabitants, who &s;eemed to them to re&s;emble the North-Americans; as they pre&s;ented to the Ru&s;&s;ians the Calumet or Pipe of Peace, which is a &s;ymbol of friend&s;hip univer&s;al among the people of North-America, and an u&s;age of arbitrary in&s;titu|tion peculiar to them.</Q></P>
<P>One of this incomparable writer's own arguments in &s;upport of his hypothe&s;is, is al&s;o urged with great
<PB N="112" REF="021728_0125_0FB5338657993E98">
judgment, and appears to be nearly conclu&s;ive. He &s;ays, <Q>We may lay it down as a certain principle in this en|quiry, that America was not peopled by any nation of the ancient continent, which had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in civilization. The inhabitants of the New World were in a &s;tate of &s;ociety &s;o extremely rude, as to be unacquainted with tho&s;e arts which are the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of human ingenuity in its advance towards im|provement. Even the mo&s;t cultivated nations of America were &s;trangers to many of tho&s;e &s;imple inven|tions, which were almo&s;t coeval with &s;ociety in other parts of the world, and were known in the earlie&s;t periods of civil life. From this it is manife&s;t that the tribes which originally migrated to America, came off from nations which mu&s;t have been no le&s;s barbarous than their po&s;terity, at the time when they were fir&s;t di&s;covered by the Europeans. If ever the u&s;e of iron had been known to the &s;avages of Ame|rica, or to their progenitors, if ever they had employ|ed a plough, a loom, or a forge, the utility of the&s;e inventions would have pre&s;erved them, and it is im|po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould have been abandoned or for|gotten.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. Of their Per&s;ons, Dre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the French in Cana|da, to the conque&s;t of it by the Engli&s;h in 1760, &s;everal of that nation, who had travelled into the interior parts of North-America, either to trade with the Indi|ans, or to endeavor to make converts of them, have publi&s;hed accounts of their cu&s;toms, manners, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The principal of the&s;e are Father Louis Hennipis, Mon&s;. Charlevoix, and the Baron Le Hontan. The fir&s;t, many years ago, publi&s;hed &s;ome very judicious re|marks,
<PB N="113" REF="021728_0126_0FB53387D755D4C8">
which he was the better enabled to do by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he received from the maps and diaries of the unfortunate M. De la Salle, who was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated whil&s;t he was on his travels, by &s;ome of his own party. That gentleman's journals falling into Father Hennipin's hands, he was enabled by them to publi&s;h many intere&s;ting particulars relative to the Indians. But in &s;ome re&s;pects he fell very &s;hort of that knowledge which it was in his power to have attained from his long re&s;idence among them. Nor was he always (as has been already ob|&s;erved) exact in his calculations, or ju&s;t in the intelligence he has given us.</P>
<P>The accounts publi&s;hed by the other two, particular|ly tho&s;e of Charlevoix, are very erroneous in the geo|graphical parts, and many of the &s;tories told by the Baron are mere delu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Some of the Je&s;uits, who heretofore travelled into the&s;e parts, have al&s;o written on this &s;ubject; but as few, if any, of their works have been tran&s;lated into the Engli&s;h language, the generality of Readers are not benefited by them; and, indeed, had this been done, they would have reaped but few advantages from them, as they have chiefly confined their ob&s;ervations to the religious principles of the &s;avages, and the &s;teps taken for their conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Since the conque&s;t of Canada, &s;ome of our own countrymen, who have lived among the Indians, and learned their language, have publi&s;hed their ob&s;ervati|ons; however as their travels have not extended to any of the interior parts I treat of, but have only been made among the nations that border on our &s;ettlements, a knowledge of the genuine and uncontaminated cu&s;|toms and manners of the Indians could not have been acquired by them.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern tribes, and tho&s;e that have held a con|&s;tant intercour&s;e with the French or Engli&s;h, cannot have pre&s;erved their manners or their cu&s;toms in their original purity. They could not avoid acquiring the vices with the language of tho&s;e they conver&s;ed with; and the frequent intoxications they experienced through the baneful juices introduced among them by the
<PB N="114" REF="021728_0127_0FB53393124DD250">
Europeans, have completed a total alteration in their characters.</P>
<P>In &s;uch as the&s;e, a confu&s;ed medley of principles or u&s;ages are only to be ob&s;erved; their real and unpolluted cu&s;toms could be &s;een among tho&s;e nations alone that have held but little communications with the provinces. The&s;e I found in the north-we&s;t parts, and therefore flatter my&s;elf that I am able to give a more ju&s;t ac|count of the cu&s;toms and manners of the Indians, in their ancient purity, than any that has been hitherto publi&s;hed. I have made ob&s;ervations on thirty nations, and though mo&s;t of the&s;e have differed in their languages, there has appeared a great &s;imilarity in their manners, and from the&s;e have I endeavored to extract the follow|ing remarks.</P>
<P>As I do not propo&s;e to give a regular and connected &s;y&s;tem of Indian concerns, but only to relate &s;uch par|ticulars of their manners, cu&s;toms, &amp;c. as I thought mo&s;t worthy of notice, and which interfere as little as po&s;&s;ible with the accounts given by other writers, I mu&s;t beg my Readers to excu&s;e their not being arranged &s;y&s;tematically, or treated of in a more copious man|ner.</P>
<P>The Indian nations do not appear to me to differ &s;o widely in their make, color, or con&s;titution from each other, as repre&s;ented by &s;ome writers. They are in general flight made, rather tall and &s;traight, and you &s;eldom &s;ee any among them deformed; their &s;kin is of a reddi&s;h or copper color; their eyes are large and black, and their hair of the &s;ame hue, but very rarely is it curled; they have good teeth, and their breath is as &s;weet as the air they draw in; their eback-bones rather rai&s;ed, but more &s;o in the women than the men; the former are not quite &s;o tall as the European woman however you frequently meet with good faces and agreeable per&s;ons among them, although they are more inclined to be fat than the other &s;ex.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter into a particular enquiry whether the Indians are indebted to nature, art, or the temperature of the climate for the color of their &s;kin, nor &s;hall I quote any of the contradictory accounts I have read
<PB N="115" REF="021728_0128_0FB5339616832730">
on this &s;ubject; I &s;hall only &s;ay, that it appears to me to be the tincture they received originally from the hands of their Creator; but at what period the variation which is at pre&s;ent vi&s;ible, both in the complexion and features of many nations took place, at what time the European whitene&s;s, the jetty hue of the African, or the copper ca&s;t of the American were given them; which was the ori|ginal color of the fir&s;t inhabitants of the earth, or which might be e&s;teemed the mo&s;t perfect, I will not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>Many writers have a&s;&s;erted, that the Indians, even at the mature&s;t period of their exi&s;tence, are only furni&s;hed with hair on their heads; and that notwith&s;tanding the profu&s;ion with which that part is covered, tho&s;e parts which among the inhabitants of other climates are u&s;u|ally the &s;eat of this excre&s;cence, remain entirely free from it. Even Doctor Robert&s;on, through their mi&s;|repre&s;entations, has contributed to propagate the error; and &s;uppo&s;ing the remark ju&s;tly founded, has drawn &s;everal conclu&s;ions from it relative to the habit and tem|perature of their bodies, which are con&s;equently invalid. But from minute enquiries, and a curious in&s;pection, I am able to declare (however re&s;pectable I may hold the authority of the&s;e hi&s;torians in other points) that their a&s;&s;ertions are erroneous, and proceeding from the want of a thorough knowledge of the cu&s;toms of the Indi|ans.</P>
<P>After the age of puberty, their bodies, in their natu|ral &s;tate, are covered in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of the Europeans. The men, indeed, e&s;teem a beard very unbecoming, and take great pains to get rid of it, nor is there any ever to be perceived on their faces, except when they grow old, and become inattentive to their appearance. Every crino&s;e efflore&s;eence on the other parts of the body is held un&s;eemly by them, and both &s;exes employ much time in their extirpation.</P>
<P>The Naudowe&s;&s;ies, and the remote nations, pluck them out with bent pieces of hard wood, formed into a kind of nippers; whil&s;t tho&s;e who have communicati|on with Europeans procure from them wire, which they twi&s;t into a &s;cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w or worm; applying this to the
<PB N="116" REF="021728_0129_0FB5339FF704A3F8">
part, they pre&s;s the rings together, and with a &s;udden twitch draw out all the hairs that are inclo&s;ed between them.</P>
<P>The men of every nation differ in their dre&s;s very lit|tle from each other, except tho&s;e who trade with the Europeans; the&s;e exchange their furs for blankets, &s;hirts, and other apparel, which they wear as much for orna|ment as nece&s;&s;ity. The latter fa&s;ten by a girdle around their wai&s;ts about half a yard of broadcloth, which co|vers the middle parts of their bodies. Tho&s;e who wear &s;hirts never make them fa&s;t either at the wri&s;t or collar; this would be a mo&s;t in&s;ufferable confinement to them. They throw their blanket loo&s;e upon their &s;houlders, and holding the upper &s;ide of it by the two corners, with a knife in one hand, and a tobacco pouch, pipe, &amp;c. in the other; thus accoutred they walk about in their villages or camps: but in their dances they &s;eldom wear this covering.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e among the men who wi&s;h to appear gayer than the re&s;t, pluck from their heads all the hair, except from a &s;pot on the top of it, about the &s;ize of a crown-piece, where it is permitted to grow to a con&s;iderable length: on this are fa&s;tened plumes of feathers of vari|ous colors, with &s;ilver or ivory quills. The manner of cutting and ornamenting this part of the head di&s;tin|gui&s;hes different nations from each other.</P>
<P>They paint their faces red and black, which they e&s;teem as greatly ornamental. They al&s;o paint them|&s;elves when they go to war; but the method they make u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion differs from that wherein they u&s;e it merely as a decoration.</P>
<P>The young Indians, who are de&s;irous of excelling their companions in finery, &s;lit the outward rim of both their ears; at the &s;ame time they take care not to &s;epa|rate them entirely, but leave the fle&s;h thus cut, &s;till un|touched at both extremities: around this &s;pongy &s;ub|&s;tance, from the upper to the lower part, they twi&s;t bra&s;s wire, till the weight draws the amputated rim into a bow of five or &s;ix inches diameter, and drags it almo&s;t down to the &s;houlder. This decoration is e&s;teemed to be exce&s;&s;ively gay and becoming.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="021728_0130_0FB533A158E71F40">It is al&s;o a common cu&s;tom among them to bore their no&s;es, and wear in them pendants of different &s;orts. I ob&s;erved that &s;ea &s;hells were much worn by tho&s;e of the interior parts, and reckoned very ornamental; but how they procure them I could not learn; probably by their traffic with other nations nearer the &s;ea.</P>
<P>They go without any covering for the thigh, except that before &s;poken of, round the middle, which reaches down half way the thighs; but they make for their legs a &s;ort of &s;tocking, either of &s;kins or cloth; the&s;e are &s;ewed as near to the &s;hape of the leg as po&s;&s;ible, &s;o as to admit of being drawn on and off. The edges of the &s;tuff of which they are compo&s;ed are left annexed to the &s;eam, and hang loo&s;e for about the breadth of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and; and this part which is placed on the out&s;ide of the leg, is generally ornamented by tho&s;e who have any communication with Europeans, if of cloth, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ds or lace, if of leather, with embroidery and por|cupine quills curiou&s;ly colored. Strangers who hunt among the Indians, in the parts where there is a great deal of &s;now, find the&s;e &s;tockings much more convenient than any others.</P>
<P>Their &s;hoes are made of the &s;kin of the deer, elk, or buf|falo: the&s;e, after being &s;ometimes dre&s;&s;ed according to the European manner, at others with the hair remaining on them, are cut into &s;hoes, and fa&s;hioned &s;o as to be ea&s;y to the feet, and convenient for walking. The edges round the ancle are decorated with pieces of bra&s;s or tin fixed around leather &s;trings, about an inch long, which being placed very thick, make a cheerful tink|ling noi&s;e either when they walk or dance.</P>
<P>The women wear a covering of &s;ome kind or other from the neck to the knees. Tho&s;e who trade with the Europeans wear a linen garment, the &s;ame as that u&s;ed by the men; the flaps of which hang over the petticoat. Such as dre&s;s after their ancient manner, make a kind of &s;hift with leather, which covers the body but not the arms. Their petticoats are made ei|ther of leather or cloth, and reach from the wai&s;t to the knee. On their legs they wear &s;tockings and &s;hoes, made and ornamented as tho&s;e of the men.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="021728_0131_0FB533A2D614AA08">They differ from each other in the mode of dre&s;&s;ing their heads, each following the cu&s;tom of the nation or band to which they belong, and adhering to the form made u&s;e of by their ance&s;tors from time in memorial.</P>
<P>I remarked that mo&s;t of the females, who dwell o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, decorate their heads by inclo&s;ing their hair either in ribands, or in plates of &s;ilver; the latter is only made u&s;e of by the higher ranks, as it is a co&s;tly ornament. The &s;ilver they u&s;e on this occa&s;ion is formed into thin plates of about four inches broad, in &s;everal of which they confine their hair. That plate which is neare&s;t the head is of a con|&s;iderable width; the next narrower, and made &s;o as to pa&s;s a little way under the other, and in this manner they fa&s;ten into each other, and gradually tapering, de|&s;cend to the wai&s;t. The hair of the Indian women be|ing in general very long, this proves an expen&s;ive method.</P>
<P>But the women that live to the we&s;t of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ip|pi, viz. the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, the A&s;&s;inipoils, &amp;c. divide their hair in the middle of the head, and form it into two rolls, one again&s;t each ear. The&s;e rolls are about three inches long, and as large as their wri&s;ts. They hang in a perpendicular attitude at the front of each ear, and de&s;cend as far as the lower part of it.</P>
<P>The women of every nation generally place a &s;pot of paint, about the &s;ize of a crown-piece, again&s;t each ear; &s;ome of them put paint on their hair, and &s;ome|times a &s;mall &s;pot in the middle of the forehead.</P>
<P>The Indians, in general, pay a greater attention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their dre&s;s, and to the ornaments with which they de|corate their per&s;ons, than to the accommodation of their huts or tents. They con&s;truct the latter in the follow|ing &s;imple and expeditious manner.</P>
<P>Being provided with poles of a proper length, they fa&s;ten two of them acro&s;s, near their ends, with b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> made of bark. Having done this, they rai&s;e them up, and extend the bottom of each as wide as they propo&s;e to make the area of the tent: they then erect others of an equal height, and fix them &s;o as to &s;upport the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

principal ones. On the whole they lay &s;kins of the elk or deer, &s;ewed together, in quantity &s;ufficient to co|ver the poles, and by lapping over to form the door.

<P>They ob&s;erve no regularity in fixing their tents when they encamp, but place them ju&s;t as it &s;uits their con|veniency.</P>
<P>The huts al&s;o, which tho&s;e who u&s;e not tents, erect when they travel, for very few tribes have fixed abodes, or regular towns, or villages, are equally &s;imple, and almo&s;t as &s;oon con&s;tructed.</P>
<P>They fix &s;mall pliable poles in the ground and bend|ing them till they meet at the top and form a &s;emi-cir|cle, then la&s;h them together. The&s;e they cover with mats made of ru&s;hes platted, or with birch bark, which they carry with them in their canoes for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e cabins have neither chimnies nor windows; there is only a &s;mall aperture left in the middle of the roofs through which the &s;moke is di&s;charged, but as this is obliged to be &s;topped up when it rains or &s;nows violently, the &s;moke then proves exceedingly trouble|&s;ome.</P>
<P>They lie on &s;kins, generally tho&s;e of the bear, which are placed in rows on the ground; and if the floor is not large enough to contain beds &s;ufficient for the ac|commodation of the whole family, a frame is erected about four or five feet from the ground, in which the younger part of it &s;leep.</P>
<P>As the habitations of the Indians are thus rude, their dome&s;tic uten&s;ils are few in number, and plain in their formation. The tools wherewith they fa&s;hion them are &s;o aukward and defective, that it is not only im|po&s;&s;ible to form them with any degree of neatne&s;s or elegance, but the time required in the execution is &s;o con&s;iderable, as to deter them from engaging in the manufacture of &s;uch as are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Of their Manners, Qualifications, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Indian women &s;it down, they place them&s;elves in a decent attitude, with their knees clo&s;e together; but from being accu&s;tomed to this po&s;ture, they walk badly, and appear to be lame.</P>
<P>They have no midwives among them, their climate, or &s;ome peculiar happine&s;s in their con&s;titutions, ren|dering any a&s;&s;i&s;tance at that time unnece&s;&s;ary. On the&s;e
<PB N="120" REF="021728_0134_0FB533B45EACF760">
occa&s;ions they are confined but a few hours from their u&s;ual employments, which are commonly very laborious, as the men, who are remarkably indolent, leave to them every kind of drudgery; even in their hunting parties the former will not deign to bring home the game, but &s;end their wives for it, though it lies at a very con&s;ider|able di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The women place their children &s;oon after they are born on boards &s;tuffed with &s;oft mo&s;s, &s;uch as is found in mora&s;&s;es or meadows. The child is laid on its back in one of this kind of cradles, and, being wrapped in &s;kins or cloth to keep it warm, is &s;ecured in it by &s;mall bent pieces of timber.</P>
<P>To the&s;e machines they fa&s;ten &s;trings, by which they hang them to branches of trees; or if they find not trees at hand, fa&s;ten them to a &s;tump or &s;tone, whil&s;t they tran&s;act any needful bu&s;ine&s;s. In this po&s;ition are the children kept for &s;ome months, when they are taken out, the boys are &s;uffered to go naked, and the girls are covered from the neck to the knees with a &s;hift and a &s;hort petticoat.</P>
<P>The Indian women are remarkably decent during their men&s;trual illne&s;s. Tho&s;e nations that are mo&s;t re|mote from the European &s;ettlements, as the Naudo|we&s;&s;ies, &amp;c. are more particularly attentive to this point; though they all without exception adhere in &s;ome degree to the &s;ame cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>In every camp or town there is an apartment ap|propriated for their retirement at this time, to which both &s;ingle and married retreat, and &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lude them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t &s;trictne&s;s during this period from all &s;o|ciety. Afterwards they purify them&s;elves in run|ning &s;treams, and return to their different employ|ments.</P>
<P>The men on the&s;e occa&s;ions mo&s;t carefully avoid hold|ing any communication with them; and the Naudowe&s;&s;ies are &s;o rigid in this ob&s;ervance, that they will not &s;uffer any belonging to them to fetch &s;uch things as are nece&s;|&s;ary, even fire, from the&s;e f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">le lunar retreats, though the want of them is attended with the greate&s;t inconve|nience. They are al&s;o &s;o &s;uper&s;titious as to think, if a

pipe &s;tem cracks, which among them is made of wood, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has either lighted it at one of the&s;e polluted fires, or held &s;ome conver&s;e with a woman during her retirement, which is e&s;teemed by them mo&s;t di&s;grace|ful and wicked.</P>
<P>The Indians are extremely circum&s;pect and deliberate in every word and action; there is nothing that hurries them into any intemperate warmth, but that inveteracy to their enemies, which is rooted in every Indian heart, and never can be eradicated. In all other in&s;tances they are cool, and remarkably cautious, taking care not to betray on any account whatever their emotions. If an Indian has di&s;covered that a friend is in danger of being intercepted and cut off by one to whom he has render|ed him&s;elf obnoxious; he does not inform him in plain and explicit terms of the danger he runs by pur&s;uing the track near which his enemy lies in wait for him, but he fir&s;t coolly a&s;ks him which way he is going that day; and having received his an&s;wer, with the &s;ame in|difference tells him that he has been informed that a dog lies near the &s;pot, which might probably do him a mi&s;|chief. This hint proves &s;ufficient; and his friend avoids the danger with as much caution as if every de&s;ign and motion of his enemy had been pointed out to him.</P>
<P>This apathy often &s;hews it&s;elf on occa&s;ions that would call forth all the fervor of a &s;u&s;ceptible heart. If an Indian has been ab&s;ent from his family and friends many months, either on a war or hunting party, when his wife and children meet him at &s;ome di&s;tance from his habita|tion, in&s;tead of the affectionate &s;en&s;ations that would naturally ari&s;e in the brea&s;t of more refined beings, and be productive of mutual congratulations, he conti|nues his cour&s;e without paying the lea&s;t attention to tho&s;e who &s;urround him, till he arrives at his home.</P>
<P>He there &s;its down, and with the &s;ame unconcern as if he had not been ab&s;ent a day, &s;mokes his pipe; tho&s;e of his acquaintance who have followed him, do the &s;ame; and perhaps it is &s;everal hours before he relates to them the incidents which have befallen him during his ab&s;ence, though perhaps he has left a father, brother, or &s;on on the field, who&s;e lo&s;s he ought to have lamented, or
<PB N="123" REF="021728_0136_0FB533B89BDFA2A8">
has been un&s;ucce&s;sful in the undertaking that called him from his home.</P>
<P>Has an Indian been engaged for &s;everal days in the chace, or on any other laborious expedition, and by ac|cident continued thus long without food, when he ar|rives at the hut or tent of a friend where he knows his wants may be immediately &s;upplied, he takes care not to &s;hew the lea&s;t &s;ymptoms of impatience, or to betray the extreme hunger by which he is tortured; but on being invited in, &s;its contentedly down, and &s;mokes his pipe with as much compo&s;ure as if every appetite was allayed, and he was perfectly at ea&s;e; he does the &s;ame if among &s;trangers. This cu&s;tom is &s;trictly adhered to by every tribe, as they e&s;teem it a proof of fortitude, and think the rever&s;e would intitle them to the appella|tion of old women.</P>
<P>If you tell an Indian that his children have greatly &s;ignalized them&s;elves again&s;t an enemy, have taken ma|ny &s;calps, and brought home many pri&s;oners, he does not appear to feel any extraordinary plea&s;ure on the oc|ca&s;ion; his an&s;wer generally is, "It is well," and he makes very little further enquiry about it. On the contrary, if you inform him that his children are &s;lain or taken pri&s;oners, he makes no complaints, he only replies, "It does not &s;ignify;" and probably, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, a&s;ks not how it happened.</P>
<P>This &s;eeming indifference, however, does not proceed from an entire &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the natural affections; for notwith&s;tanding they are e&s;teemed &s;avages, I never &s;aw among any other people greater proofs of parental or filial tenderne&s;s; and although they meet their wives af|ter a long ab&s;ence with the &s;toical indifference ju&s;t mentioned, they are not, in general, void of conjugal affection.</P>
<P>Another peculiarity is ob&s;ervable in their manner of paying their vi&s;its. If an Indian goes to vi&s;it a parti|cular per&s;on in a family, he mentions to whom his vi&s;it is intended, and the re&s;t of the family immediately re|tiring to the other end of the hut or tent, are careful not to come near enough to interrupt them during the whole of the conver&s;ation. The &s;ame method is pur&s;ued
<PB N="123" REF="021728_0137_0FB533C5115D6770">
if a man goes to pay his re&s;pects to one of the other &s;ex; but then he mu&s;t be careful not to let love be the &s;ubject of his di&s;cour&s;e, whil&s;t the day light remains.</P>
<P>The Indians di&s;cover an amazing &s;agacity, and acquire with the greate&s;t readine&s;s any thing that depends upon the attention of the mind. By experience and an acute ob&s;ervation, they attain many perfections to which Eu|ropeans are &s;trangers. For in&s;tance, they will cro&s;s a fore&s;t or a plain which is two hundred miles in breadth, and reach with great exactne&s;s the point at which they intended to arrive, keeping during the whole of that &s;pace in a direct line, without any material deviations; and this they will do with the &s;ame ca&s;e, whether the weather be fair or cloudy.</P>
<P>With equal acutene&s;s will they point to that part of the heavens the &s;un is in, though it be intercepted by clouds or fogs. Be&s;ides this, they are able to pur&s;ue with incredible facility the traces of man or bea&s;t, either on leaves or gra&s;s; and on this account it is with great dif|ficulty a flying enemy e&s;capes di&s;covery.</P>
<P>They are indebted for the&s;e talents not only to nature, but to an extraordinary command of the intellectual faculties, which can only be acquired by an unremitted attention, and by long experience.</P>
<P>They are in general very happy in a retentive memo|ry; they can recapitulate every particular that has been treated of in council, and remember the exact time when the&s;e were held. Their belts of wampum pre|&s;erve the &s;ub&s;tance of the treaties they have concluded with the neighboring tribes for ages back, to which they will appeal, and refer with as much per&s;picuity and readine&s;s as Europeans can to their written re|cords.</P>
<P>Every nation pays great re&s;pect to old age. The advice of a father will &s;eldom meet with any extraordi|nary attention from the young Indians, probably they receive it with only a bare a&s;&s;ent; but they will tremble before a grandfather, and &s;ubmit to his injunction with the utmo&s;t alacrity. The words of the ancient part of their community are e&s;teemed by the young as oracles. If they take during their hunting parties any game that
<PB N="125" REF="021728_0138_0FB533C61ADFE200">
is reckoned by them uncommonly delicious, it is imme|diately pre&s;ented to the elde&s;t of their relations.</P>
<P>They never &s;uffer them&s;elves to be overburdened with care, but live in a &s;tate of perfect tranquillity and con|tentment. Being naturally indolent, if provi&s;ion ju&s;t &s;ufficient for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence can be procured with little trouble, and near at hand, they will not go far, or take any extraordinary pains for it, though by &s;o doing they might acquire greater plenty, and of a more e&s;timable kind.</P>
<P>Having much lei&s;ure time they indulge this indolence to which they are &s;o prone, by eating, drinking, or &s;leeping, and rambling about in their towns or camps. But when nece&s;&s;ity obliges them to take the field, either to oppo&s;e an enemy, or to procure them&s;elves food, they are alert and indefatigable. Many in&s;tances of their activity, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, will be given when I treat of their wars.</P>
<P>The infatuating &s;pirit of gaming is not confined to Europe; the Indians al&s;o feel the bewtiching impul&s;e, and often lo&s;e their arms, their apparel, and every thing they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. In this ca&s;e, however, they do not follow the example of more refined game&s;ters, for they, neither murmur nor repine; not a fretful word e&s;capes them, but they bear the frowns of fortune with a philo&s;ophic compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t blemi&s;h in their character is that &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition which impels them to treat their enemies with a &s;everity every other nation &s;hudders at. But if they are thus barbarous to tho&s;e with whom they are at war, they are friendly, ho&s;pitable, and humane in peace. It may with truth be &s;aid of them, that they are the wor&s;t enemies, and the be&s;t friends, of any people in the whole world.</P>
<P>The Indians in general are &s;trangers to the pa&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y; and brand a man with folly that is di&s;tru&s;t|ful of his wife. Among &s;ome bands the very idea is not known; as the mo&s;t abandoned of their young men very rarely attempt the virtue of married women, nor do the&s;e often put them&s;elves in the way of &s;olicitation. Yet the Indian women in general are of an amorous
<PB N="125" REF="021728_0139_0FB533C795D4F188">
temperature, and before they are married are not the le&s;s e&s;teemed for the indulgence of their pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Indians in their common &s;tate are &s;trangers to all di&s;tinction of property, except in the articles of do|me&s;tic u&s;e, which every one con&s;iders as his own, and increa&s;es as circum&s;tances admit. They are extremely liberal to each other, and &s;upply the deficiency of their friends with any &s;uperfluity of their own.</P>
<P>In dangers they readily give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to tho&s;e of their band, who &s;tand in need of it, without any ex|pectation of return, except of tho&s;e ju&s;t rewards that are always conferred by the Indians on merit. Governed by the plain and equitable laws of nature, every one is rewarded &s;olely according to his de&s;erts; and their equality of condition, manners, and privileges, with that con&s;tant and &s;ociable familiarity which prevails through|out every Indian nation, animates them with a pure and truly patriotic &s;pirit, that tends to the general good of the &s;ociety to which they belong.</P>
<P>If any of their neighbors are bereaved by death, or by an enemy of their children, tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t number of &s;laves, &s;upply the deficiency; and the&s;e are adopted by them, and treated in every re&s;pect as if they really were the children of the per|&s;on to whom they are pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The Indians, except tho&s;e who live adjoining to the European colonies, can form to them&s;elves no idea of the value of money; they con&s;ider it, when they are made acquainted with the u&s;es to which it is applied by other nations, as the &s;ource of innumerable evils. To it they attribute all the mi&s;chiefs that are prevalent among Europeans, &s;uch as treachery, plundering, de|va&s;tations, and murder.</P>
<P>They e&s;teem it irrational that one man &s;hould be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a greater quantity than another, and are amazed that any honor &s;hould be annexed to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. But that the want of this u&s;ele&s;s metal &s;hould be the cau&s;e of depriving per&s;ons of their liberty, and that on account of this partial di&s;tribution of it, great numbers &s;hould be immured within the dreary walls of a pri&s;on, cut off from that &s;ociety of which they con&s;titute a
<PB N="126" REF="021728_0140_0FB533C918459B98">
part, exceeds their belief. Nor do they fail, on hearing this part of the European &s;y&s;tem of government related, to charge the in&s;titutors of it with a total want of humanity, and to brand them with the names of &s;avages and brutes.</P>
<P>They &s;hew almo&s;t an equal degree of indifference for the productions of art. When any of the&s;e are &s;hewn them, they &s;ay, "It is pretty, I like to look at it," but are not inqui&s;itive about the con&s;truction of it, neither can they form proper conceptions of its u&s;e. But if you tell them of a per&s;on who is able to run with great agility, that is well &s;killed in hunting, can direct with unerring aim a gun, or bend with ea&s;e a bow, that can dextrou&s;ly work a canoe, under&s;tands the art of war, is acquainted with the &s;ituation of a country, and can make his way without a guide, through an immen&s;e fore&s;t, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting during this on a &s;mall quantity of provi&s;ions, they are in raptures; they li&s;ten with great attention to the plea&s;ing tale, and be&s;tow the highe&s;t commendations on the hero of it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. Their Method of reckoning Time, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CONSIDERING their ignorance of a&s;trono|my, time is very rationally divided by the Indians. Tho&s;e in the interior parts (and of tho&s;e I would gene|rally be under&s;tood to &s;peak) count their years by winters; or, as they expre&s;s them&s;elves, by &s;nows.</P>
<P>Some nations among them reckon their years by moons, and make them con&s;i&s;t of twelve &s;ynodical or lunar months, ob&s;erving, when thirty moons have waned, to add a &s;upernumerary one, which they term the lo&s;t moon; and then begin to count as before. They pay a great regard to the fir&s;t appearance of every moon,
<PB N="128" REF="021728_0141_0FB533CA991C8B08">
and on the occa&s;ion always repeat &s;ome joyful &s;ounds, &s;tretching at the &s;ame time their hands towards it.</P>
<P>Every month has with them a name expre&s;&s;ive of its &s;ea&s;on; for in&s;tance, they call the month of March (in which their year generally begins at the fir&s;t New-Moon after the vernal Equinox) the Worm Month or Moon; becau&s;e at this time the worms quit their retreats in the bark of the trees, wood, &amp;c. where they have &s;heltered them&s;elves during the winter.</P>
<P>The month of April is termed by them the month of Plants. May, the Month of Flowers. June, the Hot Moon. July, the Buck Moon. Their rea&s;on for thus denominating the&s;e is obvious.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t, the Sturgeon Moon; becau&s;e in this month they catch great numbers of that fi&s;h.</P>
<P>September, the Corn Moon; becau&s;e in that month they gather in their Indian corn.</P>
<P>October, the Travelling Moon; as they leave at this time their villages, and travel towards the places where they intend to hunt during the winter.</P>
<P>November, the Beaver Moon; for in this month the beavers begin to take &s;helter in their hou&s;es, having laid up a &s;ufficient &s;tore of provi&s;ions for the winter &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>December, the Hunting Moon, becau&s;e they employ this month in pur&s;uit of their game.</P>
<P>January, the Cold Moon, as it generally freezes harder, and the cold is more inten&s;e in this than in any other month.</P>
<P>February, they call the Snow Moon, becau&s;e more &s;now commonly falls during this month, than any other in the winter.</P>
<P>When the Moon does not &s;hine they &s;ay the Moon is dead; and &s;ome call the three la&s;t days of it the naked days. The Moon's fir&s;t appearance they term its coming to life again.</P>
<P>They make no divi&s;ion of weeks; but days they count by &s;leeps; half days by pointing to the &s;un at noon; and quarters by the ri&s;ing and the &s;etting of the &s;un: to expre&s;s which in their traditions they make u&s;e of very &s;ignificant hieroglyphics.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="021728_0142_0FB533D8B6781780">The Indians are totally un&s;killed in geography as well as all the other &s;ciences, and yet, as I have before hinted, they draw on their birch bark very exact charts or maps of the countries with which they are acquaint|ed. The latitude and longitude is only wanting to make them tolerably complete.</P>
<P>Their &s;ole knowledge in a&s;tronomy con&s;i&s;ts in being able to point out the pole-&s;tar; by which they regulate their cour&s;e when they travel in the night.</P>
<P>They reckon the di&s;tance of places, not by miles or leagues, but by a day's journey, which, according to the be&s;t calculations I could make, appears to be about twenty Engli&s;h miles. The&s;e they al&s;o divide into halves and quarters, and will demon&s;trate them in their maps with great exactne&s;s, by the hieroglyphics ju&s;t mentioned, when they regulate in council their war parties, or their mo&s;t di&s;tant hunting excur&s;ions.</P>
<P>They have no idea of arithmetic; and though they are able to count to any number, figures as well as letters appear my&s;terious to them, and above their com|prehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>During my abode with the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, &s;ome of the chiefs ob&s;erving one day a draft of an eclip&s;e of the moon, in a book of a&s;tronomy which I held in my hand, they de&s;ired I would permit them to look at it. Hap|pening to give them the book &s;hut, they began to count the leaves till they came to the place in which the plate was. After they had viewed it, and a&s;ked many que&s;|tions relative to it, I told them they need not to have taken &s;o much pains to find the leaf on which it was drawn, for I could not only tell in an in&s;tant the place, without counting the leaves, but al&s;o how many pre|ceded it.</P>
<P>They &s;eemed greatly amazed at my a&s;&s;ertion, and begged that I would demon&s;trate to them the po&s;&s;ibility of doing it. To this purpo&s;e I de&s;ired the chief that held the book, to open it at any particular place, and ju&s;t &s;hewing me the page carefully to conceal the edges of the leaves, &s;o that I might not be able to count them.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="021728_0143_0FB533DBDA42DEB0">This he did with the greate&s;t caution; notwith&s;tand|ing which, by looking at the folio, I told him, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, the number of leaves. He counted them regularly over, and di&s;covered that I was exact. And when, after repeated trials, the Indians found I could do it with great readine&s;s, and without ever erring in my calculation, they all &s;eemed as much a&s;toni&s;hed as if I had rai&s;ed the dead. The only way they could account for my knowledge, was by concluding that the book was a &s;pirit, and whi&s;pered me an&s;wers to whatever I demanded of it.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance, trifling as it might appear to tho&s;e who are le&s;s illiterate, contributed to increa&s;e my con|&s;equence, and to augment the favorable opinion they already entertained of me.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. Of their Government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>EVERY &s;eparate body of Indians is divided into bands or tribes; which band or tribe forms a lit|tle community with the nation to which it belongs. As the nation has &s;ome particular &s;ymbol by which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from others, &s;o each tribe has a badge from which it is denominated: as that of the Eagle, the Panther, the Tiger, the Buffalo, &amp;c. &amp;c. One band of the Naudowe&s;&s;ies is repre&s;ented by a Snake, another a Tortoi&s;e, a third a Squirrel, a fourth a Wolf, and a fifth a Buffalo. Throughout every nation they parti|cularize them&s;elves in the &s;ame manner, and the mean|e&s;t per&s;on among them will remember his lineal de&s;cent, and di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by his re&s;pective family.</P>
<P>Did not many circum&s;tances tend to confute the &s;up|po&s;ition. I &s;hould be almo&s;t induced to conclude from this di&s;tinction of tribes, and the particular attachment
<PB N="131" REF="021728_0144_0FB533DF29FD8EB8">
of the Indians to them, that they derive their origin, as &s;ome have a&s;&s;erted, from the I&s;raelites.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, every nation di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by the manner of con&s;tructing their tents or huts. And &s;o well ver&s;ed are all the Indians in this di&s;tinction, that though there appears to be no difference on the nice&s;t ob&s;ervation made by an European, yet they will im|mediately di&s;cover, from the po&s;ition of a pole left in the ground, what nation has encamped on the &s;pot many months before.</P>
<P>Every band has a chief who is termed the Great Chief or the chief Warrior; and who is cho&s;en in con&s;iderati|on of his experience in war, and of his approved valor, to direct their military operations, and to regulate all concerns belonging to that department. But this chief is not con&s;idered as the head of the &s;tate; be&s;ides the great warrior who is elected for his war-like qualifi|cations, there is another who enjoys a pre-eminence as his hereditary right, and has the more immediate ma|nagement of their civil affairs. This chief might with greater propriety be denominated the Sachem; who&s;e a&s;&s;ent is nece&s;&s;ary in all conveyances and treaties, to which he affixes the mark of the tribe or nation.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e two are con&s;idered as the heads of the band, and the latter is u&s;ually denominated their king, yet the Indians are &s;en&s;ible of neither civil or military &s;ubordination. As every one of them entertains a high opinion of his con&s;equence, and is extremely tenacious of his liberty, all injunctions that carry with them the appearance of a po&s;itive command, are in&s;tantly rejected with &s;corn.</P>
<P>On this account, it is &s;eldom that their leaders are &s;o indi&s;creet as to give out any of their orders in a peremptory &s;tile; a bare hint from a chief that he thinks &s;uch a thing nece&s;&s;ary to be done, in&s;tantly arou&s;es an emulation among the inferior ranks, and it is immedi|ately executed with great alacrity. By this method the di&s;gu&s;tful part of the command is evaded, and an authority that falls little &s;hort of ab&s;olute &s;way in&s;tituted in its room.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="021728_0145_0FB533E058876F28">Among the Indians no vi&s;ible form of government is e&s;tabli&s;hed; they allow of no &s;uch di&s;tinction as magi|&s;trate and &s;ubject, every one appearing to enjoy an in|dependence that cannot be controlled. The object of government among them is rather foreign than dome&s;tic, for their attention &s;eems more to be employed in pre|&s;erving &s;uch an union among the members of their tribe as will enable them to watch the motions of their ene|mies, and to act again&s;t them with concert and vigor, than to maintain interior order by any public regulations. If a &s;cheme that appears to be of &s;ervice to the commu|nity is propo&s;ed by the chief, every one is at liberty to choo&s;e whether he will a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying it on; for they have no compul&s;ory laws that lay them under any re|&s;trictions. If violence is committed, or blood is &s;hed, the right of revenging the&s;e mi&s;demeanors is left to the family of the injured: the chiefs a&s;&s;ume neither the power of inflicting or moderating the puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Some nations, where the dignity is hereditary, limit the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the female line. On the death of a chief, his &s;i&s;ter's &s;on &s;ometimes &s;ucceeds him in prefer|ence to his own &s;on; and if he happens to have no &s;i&s;ter, the neare&s;t female relation a&s;&s;umes the dignity. This accounts for a woman being at the head of the Winnebago nation, which, before I was acquainted with their laws, appeared &s;trange to me.</P>
<P>Each family has a right to appoint one of its chiefs to be an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the principal chief, who watches over the intere&s;t of his family, and without who&s;e con|&s;ent nothing of a public nature can be carried into ex|ecution. The&s;e are generally cho&s;en for their ability in &s;peaking, and &s;uch only are permitted to make orations in their councils and general a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>In this body, with the hereditary chief at its head, the &s;upreme authority appears to be lodged; as by its determination every tran&s;action relative to their hunting, to their making war or peace, and to all their public concerns are regulated. Next to the&s;e, the body of warriors, which comprehends all that are able to bear arms, hold their rank. This divi&s;ion has &s;ometimes at its head the chief of the nation, if he has &s;ignalized him&s;elf by
<PB N="133" REF="021728_0146_0FB533E1D9030BB0">
any renowned action, if not, &s;ome chief that has ren|dered him&s;elf famous.</P>
<P>In their councils, which are held by the foregoing members, every affair of con&s;equence is debated; and no enterpri&s;e of the lea&s;t moment undertaken, unle&s;s it there meets with the general approbation of the chiefs. They commonly a&s;&s;emble in a hut or tent appropriated to this purpo&s;e, and being &s;eated in a circle on the ground, the elde&s;t chief ri&s;es and makes a &s;peech; when he has concluded, another gets up; and thus they all &s;peak, if nece&s;&s;ary by turns.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion their language is nervous, and their manner of expre&s;&s;ion emphatical. Their &s;tile is adorn|ed with images, compari&s;ons, and &s;trong metaphors, and is equal in allegories to that of any of the ea&s;tern na|tions. In all their &s;et &s;peeches they expre&s;s them&s;elves with much vehemence, but in common di&s;cour&s;e accord|ing to our u&s;ual method of &s;peech.</P>
<P>The young men are &s;uffered to be pre&s;ent at the councils, though they are not allowed to make a &s;peech till they are regularly admitted: they however li&s;ten with great attention, and to &s;hew that they both un|der&s;tand, and approve of the re&s;olutions taken by the a&s;&s;embled chiefs, they frequently exclaim, "That is right." "That is good."</P>
<P>The cu&s;tomary mode among all the ranks of expre&s;&s;ing their a&s;&s;ent, and which they repeat at the end of al|mo&s;t every period, is by uttering a kind of forcible a&s;piration, which &s;ounds like an union of the letters OAH.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. Of their Fea&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>MANY of the Indian nations neither make u&s;e of bread, &s;alt, or &s;pices; and &s;ome of them have never &s;een or ta&s;ted of either. The Naudowe&s;&s;ies in
<PB N="134" REF="021728_0147_0FB533EF01658B40">
particular have no bread, nor any &s;ub&s;titute for it. They eat the wild rice which grows in great quantities in different parts of their territories; but they boil it and eat it alone. They al&s;o eat the fle&s;h of the bea&s;ts they kill, without having recour&s;e to any farinaceous &s;ub|&s;tance to ab&s;orb the gro&s;&s;er particles of it. And even when they con&s;ume the &s;ugar which they have extracted from the maple tree, they u&s;e it not to render &s;ome other food palatable, but generally eat it by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Neither have they any idea of the u&s;e of milk, al|though they might collect great quantities from the buf|falo or the elk; they only con&s;ider it as proper for the nutrime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the young of the&s;e bea&s;ts during their tender &s;tate. I could not perceive that any inconveni|ency attended the total di&s;u&s;e of articles e&s;teemed &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and nutritious by other nations, on the con|trary, they are in general healthy and vigorous.</P>
<P>One di&s;h however, which an&s;wers nearly the &s;ame purpo&s;e as bread, is in u&s;e among the Ottagaumies, the Saukies, and the more ea&s;tern nations, where Indian corn grows, which is not only much e&s;teemed by them, but it is reckoned extremely palatable by all the Euro|peans who enter their dominions. This is compo&s;ed of their unripe corn as before de&s;cribed, and beans in the &s;ame &s;tate, boiled together with bear's fle&s;h, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of which moi&s;tens the pul&s;e, and renders it beyond compari&s;on delicious. They call this food Succato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</P>
<P>The Indians are far from being cannibals, as they are &s;aid to be. All their victuals are either roa&s;ted or boil|ed; and this in the extreme. Their drink is generally the broth in which it has been boiled.</P>
<P>Their food con&s;i&s;ts of the fle&s;h of the bear, the buf|falo, the elk, the deer, the beaver, and the racoon; which they prepare in the manner ju&s;t mentioned. They u&s;ually eat the fle&s;h of the deer which is naturally dry, with that of the bear which is fat and juicy; and though the latter is extremely rich and lu&s;cious, it is never known to cloy.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year the Naudowe&s;&s;ies eat the in&s;ide bark of a &s;hrub, that they gather in &s;ome part of their country; but I could neither learn the name of it,
<PB N="135" REF="021728_0148_0FB533F01B8A6E28">
or di&s;cover from whence they got it. It was of a brit|tle nature and ea&s;ily ma&s;ticated. The ta&s;te of it was very agreeable, and they &s;aid it was extremely nouri&s;h|ing. In flavor it was not unlike the turnip, and when received into the mouth re&s;embled that root both in its pulpous and frangible nature.</P>
<P>The lower ranks of the Indians are exceedingly na&s;ty in dre&s;&s;ing their victuals, but &s;ome of the chiefs are very neat and cleanly in their apparel, tents, and food.</P>
<P>They commonly eat in large parties, &s;o that their meals may properly be termed fea&s;ts; and this they do without being re&s;tricted to any fixed or regular hours, but ju&s;t as their appetites require, and conveni|ence &s;uits.</P>
<P>They u&s;ually dance either before or after every meal; and by this cheerfulne&s;s probably render the Great Spirit, to whom they con&s;ider them&s;elves as indebted for every good, a more acceptable &s;acrifice than a formal and unanimated thank&s;giving. The men and women fea&s;t apart: and each &s;ex invite by turns their compani|ons, to partake with them of the food they happen to have; but in their dome&s;tic way of living the men and women eat together.</P>
<P>No people are more ho&s;pitable, kind, and free than the Indians. They will readily &s;hare with any of their own tribe the la&s;t part of their provi&s;ions, and even with tho&s;e of a different nation, if they chance to come in when they are eating. Though they do not keep one common &s;tock, yet that community of goods which is &s;o prevalent among them, and their generous di&s;po&s;ition, render it nearly of the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>When the chiefs are convened on any public bu&s;ine&s;s, they always conclude with a fea&s;t, at which their fe&s;ti|vity and cheerfulne&s;s know no limits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII. Of their Dances.</HEAD>
<P>DANCING is a favorite exerci&s;e among the Indians; they never meet on any public occa&s;ion, but this makes a part of the entertainment. And when they are not engaged in war or hunting, the youth of both &s;exes amu&s;e them&s;elves in this manner every evening.</P>
<P>They always dance, as I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, at their fea&s;ts. In the&s;e as well as all their other dances, every man ri&s;es in his turn, and moves about with great freedom and bold|ne&s;s; &s;inging as he does &s;o, the exploits of his ance&s;|tors. During this the company, who are &s;eated on the ground in a circle, around the dancer, join with him in marking the cadence, by an odd tone, which they utter all together, and which &s;ounds, "Heh, heh, heh." The&s;e notes, if they might be &s;o termed, are articulat|ed with a har&s;h accent, and &s;trained out with the utmo&s;t force of their lungs: &s;o that one would imagine their &s;trength mu&s;t be &s;oon exhau&s;ted by it; in&s;tead of which, they repeat it with the &s;ame violence during the whole of their entertainment.</P>
<P>The women, particularly tho&s;e of the we&s;tern nations, dance very gracefully. They carry them&s;elves erect, and with their arms hanging down clo&s;e to their &s;ides, move fir&s;t a few yards to the right, and then back again to the left. This movement they perform without tak|ing any &s;teps as an European would do, but with their feet conjoined, moving by turns their toes and heels. In this manner they glide with great agility to a cer|tain di&s;tance, and then return; and let tho&s;e who join in the dance be ever &s;o numerous, they keep time &s;o ex|actly with each other that no interruption en&s;ues. During this, at &s;tated periods, they mingle their &s;hrill voices,
<PB N="137" REF="021728_0150_0FB533F315FA82B8">
with the hoar&s;er ones of the men, who &s;it around (for it is to be ob&s;erved that the &s;exes never intermix in the &s;ame dance) which, with the mu&s;ic of the drums and chichicoes, make an agreeable harmony.</P>
<P>The Indians have &s;everal kinds of dances, which they u&s;e on different occa&s;ions, as the Pipe or Calumet Dance, the War Dance, the Marriage Dance, and the Dance of the Sacrifice. The movements in every one of the&s;e are di&s;&s;imilar; but it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to con|vey any idea of the points in which they are unlike.</P>
<P>Different nations likewi&s;e vary in their manner of dancing. The Chip&eacute;ways throw them&s;elves into a greater variety of attitudes than any other people; &s;ometimes they hold their heads erect, at others they bend them almo&s;t to the ground; then recline on one &s;ide, and im|mediately after on the other. The Naudowe&s;&s;ies carry them&s;elves more upright, &s;tep firmer, and move more gracefully. But they all accompany their dances with the di&s;agreeable noi&s;e ju&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>The Pipe Dance is the principal, and the mo&s;t plea&s;ing to a &s;pectator of any of them, being the lea&s;t frantic, and the movement of it mo&s;t graceful. It is but on particular occa&s;ions that it is u&s;ed; as when amba&s;&s;adors from an enemy arrive to treat of peace, or when &s;trangers of eminence pa&s;s through their territories.</P>
<P>The War Dance, which they u&s;e both before they &s;et out on their war parties, and on their return from them, &s;trikes terror into &s;trangers. It is performed, as the others, amid&s;t a circle of the warriors; a chief ge|nerally begins it, who moves from the right to the left, &s;inging at the &s;ame time both his own exploits, and tho&s;e of his ance&s;tors. When he has concluded his ac|count of any memorable action, he gives a violent blow with his war-club, again&s;t a po&s;t that is fixed in the ground, near the centre of the a&s;&s;embly, for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Every one dances in his turn, and recapitulates the wondrous deeds of his family, till they all at la&s;t join in the dance. Then it becomes truly alarming to any &s;tranger that happens to be among them, as they throw them&s;elves into every horrible and terrifying po&s;ture that
<PB N="138" REF="021728_0151_0FB533F9A6B77FC0">
can be imagined, rehear&s;ing at the &s;ame time the parts they expect to act again&s;t their enemies in the field. During this they hold their &s;harp knives in their hands, with which, as they whirl about, they are every mo|ment in danger of cutting each others throats; and did they not &s;hun the threatened mi&s;chief with incon|ceivable dexterity, it could not be avoided. By the&s;e motions they intend to repre&s;ent the manner in which they kill, &s;calp, and take their pri&s;oners. To heighten the &s;cene, they &s;et up the &s;ame hideous yells, cries, and war-whoops they u&s;e in time of action: &s;o that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to con&s;ider them in any other light than as an a&s;&s;embly of demons.</P>
<P>I have frequently joined in this dance with them, but it &s;oon cea&s;ed to be an amu&s;ement to me, as I could not lay a&s;ide my apprehen&s;ions of receiving &s;ome dread|ful wound, that from the violence of their ge&s;tures mu&s;t have proved mortal.</P>
<P>I found that the nations to the we&s;tward of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and on the borders of Lake Superior, &s;till continue to make u&s;e of the Pawwaw or Black Dance. The people of the colonies tell a thou&s;and ridiculous &s;tories of the Devil being rai&s;ed in this dance by the Indians. But they allow that this was in former times, and is now nearly extinct among tho&s;e who live adjacent to the European &s;ettlements. However I di&s;covered that it was &s;till u&s;ed in the interior parts; and though I did not actually &s;ee the Devil rai&s;ed by it, I was witne&s;s to &s;ome &s;cenes that could only be performed by &s;uch as dealt with him, or were very expert and dextr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> jugglers.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was among the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, a dance, which they thus termed, was performed. Before the dance began, one of the Indians was admitted into a &s;ociety which they denominated Wakon-Kitchewah, that is, the Friendly Society of the Spirit. This &s;ociety is compo&s;ed of per&s;ons of both &s;exes, but &s;uch only can be admitted into it as are of unexceptionable character, and who re|ceive the approbation of the whole body. To this ad|mi&s;&s;ion &s;ucceeded the Pawwaw Dance (in which I &s;aw nothing that could give ri&s;e to the reports I had heard)
<PB N="139" REF="021728_0152_0FB53401B73D7AC0">
and the whole, according to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, conclud|ed with a grand fea&s;t.</P>
<P>The initiation being attended with &s;ome very &s;ingu|lar circum&s;tances, which, as I have before ob&s;erved, mu&s;t be either the effect of magic, or of amazing dexterity, I &s;hall give a particular account of the whole procedure. It was performed at the time of the new moon, in a place appropriated to the purpo&s;e, near the centre of their camp, that would contain about two hundred people. Being a &s;tranger, and on all occa&s;ions treated by them with great civility, I was invited to &s;ee the ceremony, and placed clo&s;e to the rails of the inclo&s;ure.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock they began to a&s;&s;emble; when the &s;un &s;hone bright, which they con&s;idered as a good omen, for they never by choice hold any of their public meetings unle&s;s the &s;ky be clear and unclouded. A great number of chiefs fir&s;t appeared, who were dre&s;&s;ed in their be&s;t apparel; and after them came the head-war|rior, clad in a long robe of rich furs, that trailed on the ground, attended by a retinue of fifteen or twenty per|&s;ons, painted and dre&s;&s;ed in the gaye&s;t manner. Next followed the wives of &s;uch as had been already admitted into the &s;ociety; and in the rear a confu&s;ed heap of the lower ranks, all contributing as mach as lay in their power to make the appearance grand and &s;howy.</P>
<P>When the a&s;&s;embly was &s;eated, and &s;ilence proclaim|ed, one of the principal chiefs aro&s;e, and in a &s;hort but ma&s;terly &s;peech informed his audience of the occa&s;ion of their meeting. He acquainted them that one of their young men wi&s;hed to be admitted into their &s;ociety; and taking him by the hand pre&s;ented him to their view, a&s;king them, at the &s;ame time, whether they had any objection to his becoming one of their community.</P>
<P>No objection being made, the young candidate was placed in the centre, and four of the chiefs took their &s;tations clo&s;e to him; after exhorting him, by turns, not to faint under the operation he was about to go through, but to behave like an Indian and a man, two of them took hold of his arms, and cau&s;ed him to kneel; another placed him&s;elf behind him, &s;o as to receive him when he
<PB N="130" REF="021728_0153_0FB53402D71C5220">
fell, and the la&s;t of the four retired to the di&s;tance of about twelve feet from him exactly in front.</P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition being completed, the chief that &s;tood before the kneeling candidate, began to &s;peak to him with an audible voice. He told him that he him&s;elf was now agitated by the &s;ame &s;pirit which he &s;hould in a few moments communicate to him; that it would &s;trike him dead, but that he would in&s;tantly be re&s;tored again to life; to this he added, that the communicati|on, however terrifying, was a nece&s;&s;ary introduction to the advantages enjoyed by the community into which he was on the point of being admitted.</P>
<P>As he &s;poke this, he appeared to be greatly agitated; till at la&s;t his emotions became &s;o violent, that his coun|tenance was di&s;torted, and his whole frame convul&s;ed. At this juncture he threw &s;omething that appeared both in &s;hape and color like a &s;mall bean, at the young man, which &s;eemed to enter his mouth, and he in&s;tantly fell as motionle&s;s as if he had been &s;hot. The chief that was placed behind him received him in his arms, and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other two, laid him on the ground to all appearance bereft of life.</P>
<P>Having done this, they immediately began to rub his limbs, and to &s;trike him on the back, giving him &s;uch blows, as &s;eemed more calculated to &s;till the quick, than to rai&s;e the dead. During the&s;e extraordinary applications, the &s;peaker continued his harangue, de|&s;iring the &s;pectators not to be &s;urpri&s;ed, or to de&s;pair of the young man's recovery, as his pre&s;ent inanimate &s;ituation proceeded only from the forcible operation of the &s;pirit, on faculties that had hitherto been unu&s;ed to in&s;pirations of this kind.</P>
<P>The candidate lay &s;everal minutes without &s;en&s;e or motion; but at length, after receiving many violent blows, he began to di&s;cover &s;ome &s;ymptoms of returning life. The&s;e, however, were attended with &s;trong con|vul&s;ions, and an apparent ob&s;truction in his throat. But they were &s;oon at an end; for having di&s;charged from his mouth the bean, or whatever it was that the chief had thrown at him, but which on the clo&s;e&s;t in&s;pection
<PB N="141" REF="021728_0154_0FB5340BD5CD7F48">
I had not perceived to enter it, he &s;oon after appeared to be tolerably recovered.</P>
<P>This part of the ceremony being happily effected, the officiating chiefs di&s;robed him of the clothes he had u&s;ually worn, and put on him a &s;et of apparel en|tirely new. When he was dre&s;&s;ed, the &s;peaker once more took him by the hand, and pre&s;ented him to the &s;ociety as a regular and thoroughly initiated member, exhorting them, at the &s;ame time, to give him &s;uch ne|ce&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as being a young member, he might &s;tand in need of. He then al&s;o charged the newly elect|ed brother to receive with humility, and to follow with punctuality the advice of his elder brethren.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e who had been admitted within the rails, now formed a circle around their new brother, and the mu&s;ic &s;triking up, the great chief &s;ung a &s;ong, celebrating as u&s;ual their martial exploits.</P>
<P>The only mu&s;ic they make u&s;e of is a drum, which is compo&s;ed of a piece of a hollow tree curiou&s;ly wrought, and over one end of which is &s;trained a &s;kin, this they heat with a &s;ingle &s;tick, and it gives a &s;ound that is far from harmonious, but it ju&s;t &s;erves to beat time with. To this they &s;ometimes add the chichicoe, and in their war dances they likewi&s;e u&s;e a kind of fife, formed of a need, which makes a &s;hrill har&s;h noi&s;e.</P>
<P>The whole a&s;&s;embly were by this time united, and the dance began; &s;everal &s;ingers a&s;&s;i&s;ted the mu&s;ic with their voices, and the women joining in the chorus at certain intervals, they produced together a not unplea&s;ing but &s;avage harmony. This was one of the mo&s;t agree|able entertainments I &s;aw whil&s;t I was among them.</P>
<P>I could not help laughing at a &s;ingular childi&s;h cu&s;|tom I ob&s;erved they introduced into this dance, and which was the only one that had the lea&s;t appearance of conjuration. Mo&s;t of the members carried in their hands an otter or marten's &s;kin, which being taken whole from the body, and filled with wind, on being com|pre&s;&s;ed made a &s;queaking noi&s;e through a &s;mall piece of wood organically formed and fixed in its mouth. When this in&s;trument was pre&s;ented to the face of any of the company, and the &s;ound emitted, the per&s;on receiving it
<PB N="142" REF="021728_0155_0FB5340D569C1DD0">
in&s;tantly fell down to appearance dead. Sometimes two or three, both men and women, were on the ground together; but immediately recovering, they ro&s;e up and joined again in the dance. This &s;eemed to afford, even the chiefs them&s;elves, infinite diver&s;ion. I afterwards learned that the&s;e were their Dii Penates or Hou&s;ehold Gods.</P>
<P>After &s;ome hours &s;pent in this manner the fea&s;t began; the di&s;hes being brought near me, I perceived that they con&s;i&s;ted of dog's fle&s;h; and I was informed that at all their public grand fea&s;ts they never made u&s;e of any other kind of food. For this purpo&s;e, at the fea&s;t I am now &s;peaking of, the new candidate provides fat dogs, if they can be procured, at any price.</P>
<P>In this cu&s;tom of eating dog's fle&s;h on particular oc|ca&s;ions, they re&s;emble the inhabitants of &s;ome of the countries that lie on the north-ea&s;t borders of A&s;ia. The author of the account of Kam&s;chatka, publi&s;hed by order of the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia (before referred to) informs us, that the people inhabiting Koreka, a coun|try north of Kam&s;chatka, who wander about in hords like the Arabs, when they pay their wor&s;hip to the evil be|ings, kill a rein-deer or a dog, the fle&s;h of which they eat, and leave the head and tongue &s;ticking on a pole with the front towards the ea&s;t. Al&s;o that when they are afraid of any infectious di&s;temper, they kill a dog, and winding the guts about two poles, pa&s;s between them. The&s;e cu&s;toms, in which they are nearly imitated by the Indians, &s;eem to add &s;trength to my &s;uppo&s;iti|on, that America was fir&s;t peopled from this quarter.</P>
<P>I know not under what cla&s;s of dances to rank that performed by the Indians who came to my tent when I landed near Lake Pepin, on the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, as related in my Journal. When I looked out, as I there mentioned, I &s;aw about twenty naked young In|dians, the mo&s;t perfect in their &s;hape, and by far the hand&s;ome&s;t of any I had ever &s;een, coming towards me, and dancing as they approached, to the mu&s;ic of their drums. At every ten or twelve yards they halted, and &s;et up their yells and cries.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="021728_0156_0FB5340EDB1E7588">When they reached my tent, I a&s;ked them to come in; which, without deigning to make me any an&s;wer, they did. As I ob&s;erved that they were painted red and black, as they u&s;ually are when they go again&s;t an ene|my, and perceived that &s;ome parts of the war-dance were intermixed with their other movements, I doubted not but they were &s;et on by the inimical chief who had refu&s;ed my &s;alutation: I therefore determined to &s;ell my life as dear as po&s;&s;ible. To this purpo&s;e, I received than &s;itting on my che&s;t, with my gun and pi&s;tols be&s;ide me, and ordered my men to keep a watchful eye on them, and to be al&s;o upon their guard.</P>
<P>The Indians being entered, they continued their dance alternately, &s;inging at the &s;ame time of their heroic ex|ploits, and the &s;uperiority of their race over every other people. To enforce their language, though it was uncom|monly nervous and expre&s;&s;ive, and &s;uch as would of it|&s;elf have carried terror to the firme&s;t heart, at the end of every period they &s;truck their war-clubs again&s;t the poles of my tent, with &s;uch violence, that I expected every moment it would have tumbled upon us. As each of them, in dancing round, pa&s;&s;ed by me, they placed their right hands over their eyes, and coming clo&s;e to me, looked me &s;teadily in the face, which I could not con&s;true into a token of friend&s;hip. My men gave them|&s;elves up for lo&s;t, and I acknowledge, for my own part, that I never found my apprehen&s;ions more tumultuous on any occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>When they had nearly ended their dance, I pre&s;ented to them the pipe of peace, but they would not receive it. I then, as my la&s;t re&s;ource, thought I would try what pre&s;ents would do; accordingly I took from my che&s;t &s;ome ribands and trinkets, which I laid before them. The&s;e &s;eemed to &s;tagger their re&s;olutions, and to avert in &s;ome degree their anger; for after holding a con|&s;ultation together, they &s;at down on the ground, which I con&s;idered as a favorable omen.</P>
<P>Thus it proved, as in a &s;hort time they received the pipe of peace, and lighting it, fir&s;t pre&s;ented it to me, and then &s;moked with it them&s;elves. Soon after they took up the pre&s;ents, which had hitherto lain neglected,
<PB N="144" REF="021728_0157_0FB5341055762400">
and appearing to be greatly plea&s;ed with them, depart|ed in a friendly manner. And never did I receive great|er plea&s;ure than at getting rid of &s;uch formidable guc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</P>
<P>It was not ever in my power to gain a thorough know|ledge of the de&s;igns of my vi&s;itors. I had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to conclude that they were ho&s;tile, and that their vi&s;it, at &s;o late an hour, was made through the in&s;tigation of the Grand Sautor; but I was afterwards informed that it might be intended as a compliment which they u&s;ual|ly pay to the chiefs of every other nation who happen to fall in with them, and that the circum&s;tances in their conduct, which had appeared &s;o &s;u&s;picious to me, were merely the effects of their vanity, and de&s;igned to im|pre&s;s on the minds of tho&s;e whom they thus vi&s;ited an elevated opinion of their valor and prowe&s;s. In the morning before I continued my route, &s;everal of their wives brought me a pre&s;ent of &s;ome &s;ugar, for when I found a few more ribands.</P>
<P>The dance of the &s;acrifice is not &s;o denominated from their offering up at the &s;ame time a &s;acrifice to any good or evil &s;pirit, but is a dance to which the Naudowe&s;&s;ies give that title from being u&s;ed when any public fortu|nate circum&s;tance befals them. Whil&s;t I re&s;ided among them, a fine large deer accidentally &s;trayed into the middle of their encampment, which they &s;oon de&s;troy|ed. As this happened ju&s;t at the new moon, they e&s;teemed it a lucky omen; and having roa&s;ted it whole, every one in the camp partook of it. After their fea&s;t, they all joined in a dance, which they termed, from its being &s;omewhat of a religious nature, a dance of the &s;acrifice.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. Of their Hunting.</HEAD>
<P>HUNTING is the principal occupation of the In|dians; they are trained to it from their earlie&s;t youth, and it is an exerci&s;e which is e&s;teemed no le&s;s honorable than nece&s;&s;ary towards their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. A dextrous and re&s;olute hunter it held nearly in as great e&s;timation by them as a di&s;tingui&s;hed warrior. Scarcely any device which the ingenuity of man has di&s;covered for en&s;naring or de&s;troying tho&s;e animals that &s;upply them with food, or who&s;e &s;kins are valuable to Europe|ans, is unknown to them.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they are engaged in this exerci&s;e, they &s;hake off the indolence peculiar to their nature, and become active, per&s;evering, and indefatigable. They are equal|ly &s;agacious in finding their prey, and in the means they u&s;e to de&s;troy it. They di&s;cern the foot&s;teps of the bea&s;ts they are in pur&s;uit of, although they are imper|ceptible to every other eye, and can follow them with certainty through the pathle&s;s fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The bea&s;ts that the Indians hunt, both for their fle&s;h on which they &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and for their &s;kins, of which they either make their apparel, or barter with the Europe|ans for nece&s;&s;aries, are the buffalo, the elk, the deer, the moo&s;e, carribboo, the bear, the beaver, the otter, the marten, &amp;c. I defer giving a de&s;cription of the&s;e creatures here, and &s;hall only at pre&s;ent treat of their manner of hunting them.</P>
<P>The route they &s;hall take for this purpo&s;e, and the parties that &s;hall go on the different expeditions are fix|ed in their general councils which are held &s;ome time in the &s;ummer, when all the operations for the en&s;uing winter are concluded on. The chief-warrior, who&s;e province it is to regulate their proceeding on this oc|ca&s;ion,
<PB N="146" REF="021728_0159_0FB5341956386678">
with great &s;olemnity i&s;&s;ues out an invitation to tho&s;e who choo&s;e to attend him; for the Indians, as be|fore ob&s;erved, acknowledge no &s;uperiority, nor have they any idea of compul&s;ion; and every one that accepts it prepares him&s;elf by fa&s;ting during &s;everal days.</P>
<P>The Indians do not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as &s;ome other nations do, on the riche&s;t and mo&s;t luxurious food, but they totally ab|&s;tain from every kind either of victuals or drink; and &s;uch is their patience end re&s;olution, that the mo&s;t ex|treme thir&s;t could not oblige them to ta&s;te a drop of water; yet amid&s;t this &s;evere ab&s;tinence they appear cheerful and happy.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons they give for thus fa&s;ting, are, that it enables them freely to dream, in which dreams they are informed where they &s;hall find the greate&s;t plenty of game; and al&s;o that it averts the di&s;plea&s;ure of the evil &s;pirits, and induces them to be propitious. They al&s;o on the&s;e occa&s;ions blacken tho&s;e parts of their bodies that are uncovered.</P>
<P>The fa&s;t being ended, and the place of hunting made known, the chief who is to conduct them, gives a grand fea&s;t to tho&s;e who are to form the different parties; of which none of them dare to partake till they have bathed them&s;elves. At this fea&s;t, notwith&s;tanding they have fa&s;ted &s;o long, they eat with great moderation; and the chief that pre&s;ides employs him&s;elf in rehear&s;ing the feats of tho&s;e who have been mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in the bu&s;ine&s;s they are about to enter upon. They &s;oon after &s;et out on the march towards the place appointed, paint|ed or rather bedawbed with black, amid&s;t the acclamati|ons of all the people.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe their agility or per&s;eve|rance, whil&s;t they are in pur&s;uit of their prey; neither thickets, ditches, torrents, pools, or rivers &s;top them; they always go &s;traight forward in the mo&s;t direct line they po&s;&s;ibly can, and there are few of the &s;avage in|habitants of the woods that they cannot overtake.</P>
<P>When they hunt for bears, they endeavor to find out their retreats; for, during the winter, the&s;e animals conceal them&s;elves in the hollow trunks of trees, or
<PB N="147" REF="021728_0160_0FB5341CED374D58">
make them&s;elves holes in the ground, where they con|tinue without food, whil&s;t the &s;evere weather la&s;ts.</P>
<P>When the Indians think they have arrived at a place where the&s;e creatures u&s;ually haunt, they form them|&s;elves into a circle according to their number, and mov|ing onward, endeavor, as they advance towards the cen|tre, to di&s;cover the retreats of their prey. By this means, if any lie in the intermediate &s;pace, they are &s;ure of arou&s;ing them, and bringing them down either with their bows or their guns. The bears will take to flight at &s;ight of a man or a dog, and will only make re&s;i&s;tance when they are extremely hungry, or after they are wounded.</P>
<P>The Indian method of hunting the buffalo is by form|ing a circle or a &s;quare, nearly in the &s;ame manner as when they &s;earch for the bear. Having taken their different &s;tations, they &s;et the gra&s;s, which at this time is rank and dry, on fire, and the&s;e animals, who are ex|tremely fearful of that element, flying with precipitati|on before it, great numbers are hemmed in a &s;mall com|pa&s;s and &s;carcely a &s;ingle one e&s;capes.</P>
<P>They have different ways of hunting the elk, the deer, and the carribboo. Sometimes they &s;eek them out in the woods, to which they retire during the &s;eve|rity of the cold, where they are ea&s;ily &s;hot from behind the trees. In the more northern climates they take the advantage of the weather to de&s;troy the elk; when the &s;un has ju&s;t &s;trength enough to melt the &s;now, and the fro&s;t in the night forms a kind of cru&s;t on the &s;ur|face, this creature being heavy, breaks it with his fork|ed hoofs, and with difficulty extricates him&s;elf from it: at this time therefore he is &s;oon overtaken and de|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Some nations have a method of hunting the&s;e animals which is more ea&s;ily executed, and free from danger. The hunting party divide them&s;elves into two bands, and choo&s;ing a &s;pot near the borders of &s;ome river, one party embarks on board their canoes, whil&s;t the other forming them&s;elves into a &s;emi-circle on the, land, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anks of which reach the &s;hore, let loo&s;e their dogs, and by this means rou&s;e all the game that lies within
<PB N="148" REF="021728_0161_0FB53421D7DA6260">
the&s;e bounds; they then drive them towards the river, into which they no &s;ooner enter, than the greate&s;t part of them are immediately di&s;patched by tho&s;e who re|main in the canoes.</P>
<P>Both the elk and the buffalo are very furious when they are wounded, and will return fiercely on their pur|&s;uers, and trample them under their feet, if the hunter finds no means to complete their de&s;truction, or does not &s;eek for &s;ecurity in flight to &s;ome adjacent tree; by this me|thod are frequently avoided, and &s;o tired with the pur|&s;uit, that they voluntarily give it over.</P>
<P>But the hunting in which the Indians, particularly tho&s;e who inhabit the northern parts, chiefly employ them&s;elves, and from which they reap the greate&s;t ad|vantage, is the beaver hunting. The &s;ea&s;on for this is throughout the whole of the winter, from November to April; during which time the fur of the&s;e creatures is in the greate&s;t perfection. A de&s;cription of this ex|traordinary animal, the con&s;truction of their huts, and the regulations of their almo&s;t rational community, I &s;hall give in another place.</P>
<P>The hunters make u&s;e of &s;everal methods to de&s;troy them. Tho&s;e generally practi&s;ed, are either that of taking them in &s;nares, cutting through the ice, or open|ing their cau&s;eways.</P>
<P>As the eyes of the&s;e animals are very quick, and their hearing exceedingly acute, great precaution is nece&s;&s;ary in approaching their abodes; for as they &s;eldom go far from the water, and their hou&s;es are always built clo&s;e to the &s;ide of &s;ome large river or lake, or dams of their own con&s;tructing, upon the lea&s;t alarm they ha&s;ten to the deepe&s;t part of the water, and dive immediately to the bottom; as they do this they make a great noi&s;e by beating the water with their tails, on purpo&s;e to put the whole fraternity on their guard.</P>
<P>They take them with &s;nares in the following man|ner: though the beavers u&s;ually lay up a &s;ufficient &s;tore of provi&s;ion to &s;erve for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence during the winter, they make from time to time excur&s;ions to the neghboring woods to procure further &s;upplies of food. The hunters having found out their haunts, place a trap
<PB N="149" REF="021728_0162_0FB5342496A6FB10">
in their way, baited with &s;mall pieces of bark, or young &s;hoots of trees, which the beaver has no &s;ooner laid hold of, than a large log of wood falls upon him, and breaks his back; his enemies, who are upon the watch, &s;oon appear, and in&s;tantly di&s;patch the helple&s;s animal.</P>
<P>At other times, when the ice on the rivers and lakes is about half a foot thick, they make an opening through it with their hatchets, to which the beavers will &s;oon ha&s;ten, on being di&s;turbed at their hou&s;es, for a &s;upply of fre&s;h air. As their breath occa&s;ions a con&s;iderable motion in the water, the hunter has &s;ufficient notice of their approach, and methods are ea&s;ily taken for knock|ing them on the head the moment they appear above the &s;urface.</P>
<P>When the hou&s;es of the beavers happen to be near a rivulet, they are more ea&s;ily de&s;troyed: the hunters then cut the ice, and &s;preading a net under it, break down the cabins of the beavers, who never fail to make to|wards the deepe&s;t part, where they are entangled and taken. But they mu&s;t not be &s;uffered to remain there long, as they would &s;oon extricate them&s;elves with their teeth, which are well known to be exce&s;&s;ively &s;harp and &s;trong.</P>
<P>The Indians take great care to hinder their dogs from touching the bones of the beavers. The rea&s;ons they give for the&s;e precautions, are, fir&s;t, that the bones are &s;o exce&s;&s;ively hard, that they &s;poil the teeth of the dogs; and, &s;econdly, that they are apprehen&s;ive they &s;hall &s;o exa&s;perate the &s;pirits of the beavers by this permi&s;&s;ion, as to render the next hunting &s;ea&s;on un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>The &s;kins of the&s;e animals the hunters exchange with the Europeans for nece&s;&s;aries, and as they are more valued by the latter than any other kind of furs, they pay the greate&s;t attention to this &s;pecies of hunting.</P>
<P>When the Indians de&s;troy buffalos, elks, deer, &amp;c. they generally divide the fle&s;h of &s;uch as they have taken among the tribe to which they belong. But in hunting the bearer a few families u&s;ually unite and di|vide the &s;poil between them. Indeed, in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance they generally pay &s;ome attention in the divi|&s;ion to their own families; but no jealou&s;ies or murmur|ings
<PB N="150" REF="021728_0163_0FB5342A6D0A6540">
are ever known to ari&s;e on account of any appa|rent partiality.</P>
<P>Among the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, if a per&s;on &s;hoots a deer, buffalo, &amp;c. and it runs to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance be|fore it drops, where a per&s;on belonging to another tribe, being nearer, fir&s;t &s;ticks a knife into it, the game is con&s;idered as the property of the latter, notwith&s;tand|ing it had been mortally wounded by the former. Though this cu&s;tom appears to be arbitrary and unju&s;t, yet that people cheerfully &s;ubmit to it. This deci&s;ion is, however, very different from that practi&s;ed by the Indians on the back of the colonies, where the fir&s;t per&s;on that hits it is entitled to the be&s;t &s;hare.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. Of their Manner of making War, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Indians begin to bear arms at the age of fifteen, and lay them a&s;ide when they arrive at the age of &s;ixty. Some nations to the &s;outhward, I have been informed, do not continue their military exerci&s;es after they are fifty.</P>
<P>In every band or nation there is a &s;elect number who are &s;tiled the warriors, and who are always ready to act either offen&s;ively or defen&s;ively, as occa&s;ion requires. The&s;e are well armed, bearing the weapons commonly in u&s;e among them, which vary according to the &s;itua|tion of their countries. Such as have an intercour&s;e with the Europeans make u&s;e of tomahawks, knives, and fire-arms; but tho&s;e who&s;e dwellings are &s;ituated to the we&s;tward of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and who have not an opportunity of purcha&s;ing the&s;e kinds of weapons, u&s;e bows and arrows, and al&s;o the Ca&s;&s;&eacute; T&ecirc;te or War-Club.</P>
<P>The Indians that inhabit &s;till further to the we&s;tward, a country which extends to the South Sea, u&s;e in &s;ight
<PB N="151" REF="021728_0164_0FB5342FD6701078">
a warlike in&s;trument that is very uncommon. Having great plenty of hor&s;es, they always attack their enemies on hor&s;eback, and encumber them&s;elves with no other weapon, than a &s;tone of a middling &s;ize, curiou&s;ly wrought, which they fa&s;ten by a &s;tring, about a yard and a half long, to their right arms, a little above the elbow. The&s;e &s;tones they conveniently carry in their hands, till they reach their enemies, and then &s;winging them with great dexterity, as they ride full &s;peed, never fail of doing execution. The country which the&s;e tribes po&s;|&s;e&s;s, abounding with large exten&s;ive plains, tho&s;e who attack them &s;eldom return; as the &s;wiftne&s;s of the hor&s;es, on which they are mounted, enables them to overtake even the fleete&s;t of their invaders.</P>
<P>The Naudowe&s;&s;ies, who had been at war with this people, informed me, that unle&s;s they found mora&s;&s;es or thickets to which they could retire, they were &s;ure of being cut off: to prevent this they always took care whenever they made an on&s;et, to do it near &s;uch re|treats as were impa&s;&s;able for cavalry, they then having a great advantage over their enemies, who&s;e weapons would not there reach them.</P>
<P>Some nations make u&s;e of a javelin, pointed with bone, worked into different forms; but their Indian weapons in general are bows and arrows, and the &s;hort club already mentioned. The latter is made of a very hard wood, and the head of it fa&s;hioned round like a ball, about three inches and a half diameter; in this rotend part is fixed an edge re&s;embling that of a toma|hawk, either of &s;teel or flint, which&s;oever they can pro|cure.</P>
<P>The dagger is peculiar to the Naudowe&s;&s;ie nation, and of ancient con&s;truction, but they can give no ac|count how long it has been in u&s;e among them. It was originally made of flint or bone, but &s;ince they have had communication with the European traders, they have formed it of &s;teel. The length of it is about ten inches, and that part clo&s;e to the handle nearly three inches broad. Its edges are keen, and it gradual|ly tapers towards a point. They wear it in a &s;heath made of deer's leather, neatly ornamented with porcu|pine
<PB N="152" REF="021728_0165_0FB53432D62747A8">
quills; and it is u&s;ually hung by a &s;tring, decorated in the &s;ame manner, which reaches as low only as the brea&s;t. This curious weapon is worn by a few of the principal chiefs alone, and con&s;idered both as an u&s;eful in&s;trument, and an ornamental badge of &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved among the Naudowe&s;&s;ies a few targets or &s;hields made of raw buffalo hides, and in the form of tho&s;e u&s;ed by the ancients. But as the number of the&s;e was &s;mall, and I could gain no intelligence of the aera in which they fir&s;t were introduced among them, I &s;up|po&s;e tho&s;e I &s;aw had de&s;cended from father to &s;on for many generations.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons the Indians give for making war again&s;t one another, are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e urged by more civilized nations for di&s;turbing the tranquillity of their neighbors. The pleas of the former are however in general more rational and ju&s;t, than &s;uch as are brought by Europeans in vindication of their proceedings.</P>
<P>The exten&s;ion of empire is &s;eldom a motive with the&s;e people to invade, and to commit depredations on the territories of tho&s;e who happen to dwell near them. To &s;ecure the rights of hunting within particular limits, to maintain the liberty of pa&s;&s;ing through their accu&s;|tomed tracks, and to guard tho&s;e lands which they con&s;ider from a long tenure as their own, again&s;t any infringement, are the general cau&s;es of tho&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions that &s;o often break out between the Indian nations, and which are carried on with &s;o much animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>Though &s;trangers to the idea of &s;eparate property, yet the mo&s;t uncultivated among them are well acquaint|ed with the rights of their community to the domains they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and oppo&s;e with vigor every encroachment on them.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed that from their territories being &s;o exten&s;ive, the boundaries of them cannot be a&s;certained, yet I am well a&s;&s;ured that the limits of each nation in the interior parts are laid down in their rude plans with great preci&s;ion. By theirs, as I have before ob&s;erved, was I enabled to regulate my own; and after the mo&s;t exact ob&s;ervati|ons
<PB N="153" REF="021728_0166_0FB53434556F6570">
and inquiries found very few in&s;tances in which they erred.</P>
<P>But intere&s;t is not either the mo&s;t frequent or mo&s;t pow|erful incentive to their making war on each other. The pa&s;&s;ion of revenge, which is the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the&s;e people, is the mo&s;t general motive. Injuries are felt by them with exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, and vengeance pur&s;ued with unremitted ardor. To this may be added, that natural excitation which every In|dian becomes &s;en&s;ible of as &s;oon as he approaches the age of manhood to give proofs of his valor and prow|e&s;s.</P>
<P>As they are early po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a notion that war ought to be the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives, that there is nothing more de&s;irous than the reputation of being a great warrior, and that the &s;calps of their enemies, or a number of pri&s;oners are alone to be e&s;teemed valuable, it is not to be wondered at that the younger Indians are continually re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y if their ardor is repre&s;|&s;ed, and they are kept in a &s;tate of inactivity. Either of the&s;e propen&s;ities, the de&s;ire of revenge, or the gra|tification of an impul&s;e, that by degrees becomes habitual to them, is &s;ufficient, frequently, to induce them to com|mit ho&s;tilities on &s;ome of the neighboring nations.</P>
<P>When the chiefs find any occa&s;ion for making war, they endeavor to arou&s;e the&s;e habitudes, and by that means &s;oon excite their warriors to take arms. To this purpo&s;e they make u&s;e of their martial eloquence, nearly in the following words, which never fails of proving effectual; <Q>The bones of our decea&s;ed countrymen lie uncovered, they call out to us to revenge their wrongs, and we mu&s;t &s;atisfy their reque&s;t. Their &s;pirits cry out again&s;t us. They mu&s;t be appea&s;ed. The genii, who are the guardians of our honor, in&s;pire us with a re&s;olution to &s;eek the enemies of our murdered brothers. Let us go and devour tho&s;e by whom they were &s;lain. Sit therefore no longer inactive, give way to the impul&s;e of your natural valor, anoint your hair, paint your faces, fill your quivers, cau&s;e the fore&s;ts to re&s;ound with your &s;ongs, con&s;ole the
<PB N="154" REF="021728_0167_0FB5343BE86097F8">
&s;pirits of the dead, and tell them they &s;hall be re|venged.</Q></P>
<P>Animated by the&s;e exhortations the warriors &s;natch their arms in a tran&s;port of fury, &s;ing the &s;ong of war, and burn with impatience to imbrue their hands in the blood of their enemies.</P>
<P>Sometimes private chiefs a&s;&s;emble &s;mall parties, and make excur&s;ions again&s;t tho&s;e with whom they are at war, or &s;uch as have injured them. A &s;ingle warrior, prompted by revenge or a de&s;ire to &s;how his prowe&s;s, will march unattended for &s;everal hundred miles, to &s;ur|pri&s;e and cut off a &s;traggling party.</P>
<P>The&s;e irregular &s;allies, however, are not always ap|proved of by the elder chiefs, though they are often obliged to connive at them; as in the in&s;tance before given of the Naudowe&s;&s;ie and Chip&eacute;way na|tions.</P>
<P>But when a war is national, and undertaken by the community, their deliberations are formal and &s;low. The elders a&s;&s;emble in council, to which all the head warriors and young men are admitted, where they deliver their opinions in &s;olemn &s;peeches, weighing with maturity the nature of the enterpri&s;e they are about to engage in, and balancing with great &s;agacity the advantages or incon|veniences that will ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>Their prie&s;ts are al&s;o con&s;ulted on the &s;ubject, and even, &s;ometimes, the advice of the mo&s;t intelligent of their women is a&s;ked.</P>
<P>If the determination be for war, they prepare for it with much ceremony.</P>
<P>The chief warrior of a nation does not on all occa&s;i|ons head the war party him&s;elf, he frequently deputes a warrior of who&s;e valor and prudence he has a good opi|nion. The per&s;on thus fixed on being fir&s;t bedawbed with black, ob&s;erves a fa&s;t of &s;everal days, during which he invokes the Great Spirit, or deprecates the anger of the evil ones, holding whil&s;t it la&s;ts no conver&s;e with any of his tribe.</P>
<P>He is particularly careful at the &s;ame time to ob&s;erve his dreams, for on the&s;e do they &s;uppo&s;e their &s;ucce&s;s will in a great mea&s;ure depend; and from the firm per&s;ua&s;ion
<PB N="155" REF="021728_0168_0FB53441D4879D80">
every Indian actuated by his own pre&s;umptuous thoughts is impre&s;&s;ed with, that he &s;hall march forth to certain victory, the&s;e are generally favorable to his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>After he has fa&s;ted as long as cu&s;tom pre&s;cribes, he a&s;&s;embles the warriors, and holding a belt of wampum in his hand, thus addre&s;&s;es them:</P>
<P><Q>Brothers! by the in&s;piration of the Great Spirit I now &s;peak unto you, and by him am I prompted to carry into execution the intentions which I am about to di&s;clo&s;e to you. The blood of our decea&s;ed bro|thers is not yet wiped away; their bodies are not yet covered, and I am going to perform this duty to them.</Q></P>
<P>Having then made known to them all the motives that induce him to take up arms again&s;t the nation with whom they are to engage, he thus proceeds: <Q>I have therefore re&s;olved to march through the war-path to &s;urpri&s;e them. We will eat their fle&s;h, and drink their blood; we will take &s;calps, and make pri&s;oners; and &s;hould we peri&s;h in this glorious enterpri&s;e, we &s;hall not be for ever hid in the du&s;t, for this belt &s;hall be a recompen&s;e to him who buries the dead.</Q> Having &s;aid this, he lays the belt on the ground, and he who takes it up declares him&s;elf his lieutenant, and is con&s;idered as the &s;econd in command; this, however, is only done by &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed warrior who has a right by the number of his &s;calps, to the po&s;t.</P>
<P>Though the Indians thus a&s;&s;ert that they will eat the fle&s;h and drink the blood of their enemies, the threat is only to be con&s;idered as a figurative expre&s;&s;ion. Notwith|&s;tanding they &s;ometimes devour the hearts of tho&s;e they &s;lay, and drink their blood, by way of bravado, or to gratify in a more complete manner their revenge, yet they are not naturally anthropophagi, nor ever feed on the fle&s;h of men.</P>
<P>The chief is now wa&s;hed from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his &s;able covering, anointed with bear's fat, and painted with their red paint, in &s;uch figures as will make him appear mo&s;t ter|rible to his enemies. He then &s;ings the war &s;ong, and enumerates his warlike actions. Having done this he fixes his eyes on the &s;un, and pays his adorations to the
<PB N="156" REF="021728_0169_0FB5344296CECE60">
Great Spirit, in which he is accompanied by all the warriors.</P>
<P>This ceremony it followed with dances, &s;uch as I have before de&s;cribed; and the whole concludes with a fea&s;t, which u&s;ually con&s;i&s;ts of dogs' fle&s;h.</P>
<P>This fea&s;t is held in the hut or tent of the chief war|rior, to which all tho&s;e who intend to accompany him in his expedition &s;end their di&s;hes to be filled; and dur|ing the fea&s;t, notwith&s;tanding he has fa&s;ted &s;o long, he &s;its compo&s;edly with his pipe in his mouth, and recounts the valorous deeds of his family.</P>
<P>As the hopes of having their wounds, &s;hould they receive any, properly treated, and expeditiou&s;ly cured, mu&s;t be &s;ome additional inducement to the warriors to expo&s;e them&s;elves more freely to danger, the prie&s;ts, who are al&s;o their doctors, prepare &s;uch medecines as will prove efficacious. With great ceremony they carry va|rious roots and plants, and pretend that they impart to them the power of healing.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this &s;uper&s;titious method of proceed|ing, it is very certain that they have acquired a know|ledge of many plants and herbs that are of a medicinal quality, and which they know how to u&s;e with great &s;kill.</P>
<P>From the time the re&s;olution of engaging in a war is taken, to the departure of the warriors, the nights are &s;pent in fe&s;tivity, and their days in making the needful preparations.</P>
<P>If it is thought nece&s;&s;ary by the nation going to war, to &s;olicit the alliance of any neighboring tribe, they fix upon one of their chiefs who &s;peaks the language of that people well, and who is a good orator, and &s;end to them by him a belt of wampum, on which is &s;peci|fied the purport of the emba&s;&s;y in figures that every nation is well acquainted with. At the &s;ame time he carries with him a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">chet painted red.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he reaches the camp or village to which he is de&s;tined, he acquaints the chief of the tribe with the general tenor of his commi&s;&s;ion, who immediately a&s;&s;embles a council, to which the amba&s;&s;ador is invited. There having laid the hatchet on the ground he holds
<PB N="157" REF="021728_0170_0FB53444172523F0">
the belt in his hand, and enters more minutely into the occa&s;ion of his emba&s;&s;y. In his &s;peech he invites them to take up the hatchet, and as &s;oon as he has fini&s;hed &s;peaking delivers the belt.</P>
<P>If his hearers are inclined to become auxiliaries to his nation, a chief &s;teps forward and takes up the hatchet, and they immediately e&s;pou&s;e with &s;pirit the cau&s;e they have thus engaged to &s;upport. But if on this applica|tion neither the belt or hatchet are accepted, the emi&s;|&s;ary concludes that the people who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he &s;oli|cist have already entered into an alliance with the foes of his nation, and returns with &s;peed to inform his countrymen of his ill &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The manner in which the Indians declare war again&s;t each other, is by &s;ending a &s;lave with a hatchet, the handle of which is painted red, to the nation which they intend to break with; and the me&s;&s;enger, notwith|&s;tanding the danger to which he is expo&s;ed from the &s;udden fury of tho&s;e whom he thus &s;ets at defiance, executes his commi&s;&s;ion with great fidelity.</P>
<P>Sometimes this token of defiance has &s;uch an in&s;tan|taneous effect on tho&s;e to whom it is pre&s;ented, that in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their fury a &s;mall party will i&s;&s;ue forth, without waiting for the permi&s;&s;ion of the elder chiefs, and &s;laying the fir&s;t of the offending nation they meet, cut open the body and &s;tick a hatchet of the &s;ame kind as that they have ju&s;t received, into the heart of their &s;laughtered foe. Among the more remote tribes this is done with an arrow or &s;pear, the end of which is painted red. And the more to exa&s;perate, they di&s;|member the body, to &s;how that they e&s;teem them not as men but as old women.</P>
<P>The Indians &s;eldom take the field in large bodies, as &s;uch numbers would require a greater degree of indu&s;try to provide for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, during their tedious marches through dreary fore&s;ts, or long voyages over lakes and rivers, than they would care to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Their armies are never encumbered with baggage or military &s;tores. Each warrior, be&s;ides his weapons, car|ries with him only a mat, and whil&s;t at a di&s;tance from
<PB N="158" REF="021728_0171_0FB53445954B2C00">
the frontiers of the enemy &s;upports him&s;elf with the game he kills or the fi&s;h he catches.</P>
<P>When they pa&s;s through a country where they have no apprehen&s;ions of meeting with an enemy, they u&s;e very little precaution: &s;ometimes there are &s;carcely a dozen warriors left together, the re&s;t being di&s;per&s;ed in pur&s;uit of their game; but though they &s;hould have roved to a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the war-path, they are &s;ure to arrive at the place of rendezvous by the hour appointed.</P>
<P>They always pitch their tents long before &s;un-&s;et; and being naturally pre&s;umptuous, take very little care to guard again&s;t a &s;urpri&s;e. They place great confidence in their Manitous, or hou&s;ehold gods, which they always carry with them; and being per&s;uaded that they take upon them the office of centinels, they &s;leep very &s;e|curely under their protection.</P>
<P>The&s;e Manitous, as they are called by &s;ome nations, but which are termed Wakons, that is, &s;pirits, by the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, are nothing more than the otter and mar|ten &s;kins I have already de&s;cribed, for which, however, they have a great veneration.</P>
<P>After they have entered the enemies country, no peo|ple can be more cautious and circum&s;pect; fires are no longer lighted, no more &s;houting is heard, nor the game any longer pur&s;ued. They are not even permitted to &s;peak; but mu&s;t convey whatever they have to impart to each other by &s;igns and motions.</P>
<P>They now proceed wholly by &s;tratagem and ambu&s;|cade. Having di&s;covered their enemies, they &s;end to reconnoitre them; and a council is immediately held, during which they &s;peak only in whi&s;pers, to con&s;ider of the intelligence imparted by tho&s;e who were &s;ent out.</P>
<P>The attack is generally made ju&s;t before day-break, at which period they &s;uppo&s;e the foes to be in their &s;ound|e&s;t &s;leep. Throughout the whole of the preceding night they will lie flat upon their faces, without &s;tirring; and make their approaches in the &s;ame po&s;ture, creeping upon their hands and feet till they are got within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;hot of tho&s;e they have de&s;tined to de&s;truction. On a &s;ignal given by the chief warrior, to which the whole
<PB N="159" REF="021728_0172_0FB5344D9C936630">
body makes an&s;wer by the mo&s;t hideous yells, they all &s;tart up, and di&s;charging their arrows in the &s;ame in|&s;tant, without giving their adver&s;aries time to recover from the confu&s;ion into which they are thrown, pour in upon them with their war-clubs or tomahawks.</P>
<P>The Indians think there is little glory to be acquired from attacking their enemies openly in the field; their greate&s;t pride is to &s;urpri&s;e and de&s;troy. They &s;eldom en|gage without a manife&s;t appearance of advantage. If they find the enemy on their guard, too &s;trongly en|trenched, or &s;uperior in numbers, they retire, provided there is an opportunity of doing &s;o. And they e&s;teem it the greate&s;t qualification of a chief warrior, to be able to manage an attack, &s;o as to de&s;troy as many of the enemy as po&s;&s;ible, at the expence of a few men.</P>
<P>Sometimes they &s;ecure them&s;elves behind trees, hillocks, or &s;tones, and having given one or two rounds retire be|fore they are di&s;covered. Europeans, who are unac|quainted with this method of fighting too often find to their co&s;t the de&s;tructive efficacy of it.</P>
<P>General Braddock was one of this unhappy number. Marching in the year 1755, to attack Fort Du Que&s;ne, he was intercepted by a party of French and confederate Indians in their intere&s;t, who by this infidious method of engaging found means to defeat his army, which con&s;i&s;ted of about two thou&s;and brave and well di&s;ciplin|ed troops. So &s;ecurely were the Indians po&s;ted, that the Engli&s;h &s;carcely knew from whence or by whom they were thus annoyed. During the whole of the engagement the latter had &s;carcely a &s;ight of an enemy; and were obliged to retreat without the &s;atisfaction of being able to take the lea&s;t degree of revenge for the havoc made among them. The General paid for his temerity with his life, and was accompanied in his fall by a great num|ber of brave fellows; whil&s;t his invi&s;ible enemies had only two or three of their number wounded.</P>
<P>When the Indians &s;ucceed in their &s;ilent approaches, and are able to force the camp which they attack, a &s;cene of horror that exceeds de&s;cription, en&s;ues. The &s;avage fiercene&s;s of the conquerors, and the de&s;peration of the conquered, who well know what they have to
<PB N="160" REF="021728_0173_0FB53450D7F7BE00">
expect &s;hould they fall alive into the hands of their a&s;|&s;ailants, occa&s;ion the mo&s;t extraordinary exertions on both &s;ides. The figure of the combatants all be&s;mear|ed with black and red paint, and covered with the blood of the &s;lain, their horrid yells, and ungovernable fury, are not to be conceived by tho&s;e who have never cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic.</P>
<P>I have frequently been a &s;pectator of them, and once bore a part in a &s;imilar &s;cene. But what added to the horror of it was, that I had not the con&s;olation of be|ing able to oppo&s;e their &s;avage attacks. Every circum|&s;tance of the adventure &s;till dwells on my remembrance, and enables me to de&s;cribe with greater per&s;picuity the brutal fiercene&s;s of the Indians when they have &s;ur|pri&s;ed or overpowered an enemy.</P>
<P>As a detail of the ma&s;&s;acre at Fort William Henry in the year 1757, the &s;cene to which I refer, cannot appear foreign to the de&s;ign of this publication, but will &s;erve to give my readers a ju&s;t idea of the ferocity of this people, I &s;hall take the liberty to in&s;ert it, apo|logizing at the &s;ame time for the length of the digre&s;&s;i|on, and tho&s;e egoti&s;ms which the relation renders un|avoidable.</P>
<P>General Webb, who commanded the Engli&s;h army in North-America, which was then encamped at Fort Edward, having intelligence that the French troops un|der Mon&s;. Montcalm were making &s;ome movements to|wards Fort William Henry, he detached a corps of about fifteen hundred men, con&s;i&s;ting of Engli&s;h and Pro|vincials, to &s;trengthen the garri&s;on. In this party I went as a volunteer among the latter.</P>
<P>The apprehen&s;ions of the Engli&s;h General were not without foundation; for the day after our arrival we &s;aw Lake George (formerly Lake Sacrament) to which it lies contiguous, covered with an immen&s;e number of boats; and in a few hours we found our lines attacked by the French General, who had ju&s;t landed with eleven thou&s;and Regulars and Canadians, and two thou&s;and In|dians. Colonel Monro, a brave officer, commanded in the Fort, and had no more than two thou&s;and three hundred men with him, our detachment included.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="021728_0174_0FB5345257176850">With the&s;e he made a gallant defence, and probably would have been able at la&s;t to pre&s;erve the Fort, had he been properly &s;upported, and permitted to continue his efforts. On every &s;ummons to &s;urrender &s;ent by the French General, who offered the mo&s;t honorable terms, his an&s;wer repeatedly was, That he yet found him&s;elf in a condition to repel the mo&s;t vigorous attacks his be|&s;iegers were able to make; and if he thought his pre&s;ent force in&s;ufficient, he could &s;oon be &s;upplied with a great|er number from the adjacent army.</P>
<P>But the Colonel having acquainted General Webb with his &s;ituation, and de&s;ired he would &s;end him &s;ome fre&s;h troops, the General di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to him with a letter, wherein he informed him that it was not in his power to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and therefore gave him or|ders to &s;urrender up the Fort on the be&s;t terms he could procure. This packet fell into the hands of the French General, who immediately &s;ent a flag of truce, de&s;iring a conference with the governor.</P>
<P>They accordingly met, attended only by a &s;mall guard, in the centre between the lines; when Mon&s;. Montcalm told the Colonel, that he was come in per&s;on to demand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Fort, as it belonged to the King his ma&s;ter. The Colonel replied, that he knew not how that could be, nor &s;hould he &s;urrender it up whil&s;t it was in his power to defend it.</P>
<P>The French General rejoined, at the &s;ame time de|livering the packet into the Colonel's hand, <Q>By this authority do I make the requi&s;ition.</Q> The brave Go|vernor had no &s;ooner read the contents of it, and was convinced that &s;uch were the orders of the commander in chief, and not to be di&s;obeyed, than he hung his head in &s;ilence, and reluctantly entered into a negoti|ation.</P>
<P>In con&s;ideration of the gallant defence the garri&s;on had made, they were to be permitted to march out with all the honors of war, to be allowed covered waggons to tran&s;port their baggage to Fort Edward, and a guard to protect them from the fury of the &s;avages.</P>
<P>The morning after the capitulation was &s;igned, as &s;oon as day broke, the whole garri&s;on, now con&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="162" REF="021728_0175_0FB53455578A8510">
of about two thou&s;and men, be&s;ides women and children, were drawn up within the lines, and on the point of marching off, when great numbers of the Indians ga|thered about, and began to plunder. We were at fir&s;t in hopes that this was their only view, and &s;uffered them to proceed without oppo&s;ition. Indeed it was not in our power to make any, had we been &s;o inclined; for though we were permitted to carry off our arms, yet we were not allowed a &s;ingle round of ammunition. In the&s;e hopes however we were di&s;appointed: for pre&s;ently &s;ome of them began to attack the &s;ick and wounded, when &s;uch as were not able to crawl into the ranks, notwith&s;tanding they endeavored to avert the fury of their enemies by their &s;hrieks or groans, were &s;oon di&s;|patched.</P>
<P>Here we were fully in expectation that the di&s;turb|ance would have concluded; and our little army began to move; but in a &s;hort time we &s;aw the front divi&s;ion driven back, and di&s;covered that we were entirely en|circled by the &s;avages. We expected every moment that the guard, which the French, by the articles of capitulation, had agreed to allow us, would have arrived, and put an end to our apprehen&s;ions; but none appear|ed. The Indians now began to &s;trip every one without exception of their arms and clothes, and tho&s;e who made the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance felt the weight of their toma|hawks.</P>
<P>I happened to be in the rear divi&s;ion, but it was not long before I &s;hared the fate of my companions. Three or four of the &s;avages laid hold of me, and whil&s;t &s;ome held their weapons over my head, the others &s;oon di&s;|robed me of my coat, wai&s;tcoat, hat, and buckles, omit|ting not to take from me what money I had in my pocket. As this was tran&s;acted clo&s;e by the pa&s;&s;age that led from the lines on to the plain, near which a French centinel was po&s;ted, I ran to him and claimed his pro|tection; but he only called me an Engli&s;h dog, and thru&s;t me with violence back again into the mid&s;t of the Indians.</P>
<P>I now endeavored to join a body of our troops that were crowded together at &s;ome di&s;tance; but innumera|ble
<PB N="163" REF="021728_0176_0FB5345D6C6CDD20">
were the blows that were made at me with different weapons as I pa&s;&s;ed on; luckily however the &s;avages were &s;o clo&s;e together, that they could not &s;trike at me without endangering each other. Notwith&s;tanding which one of them found means to make a thru&s;t at me with a &s;pear, which grazed my &s;ide, and from another I received a wound, with the &s;ame kind of weapon, in my ankle. At length I gained the &s;pot where my countrymen &s;tood, and forced my&s;elf into the mid&s;t of them. But before I got thus far out of the hands of the Indians, the collar and wri&s;tbands of my &s;hirt were all that re|mained of it, and my fle&s;h was &s;cratched and torn in many places by their &s;avage gripes.</P>
<P>By this time the war whoop was given, and the In|dians began to murder tho&s;e that were neare&s;t to them without di&s;tinction. It is not in the power of words to give any tolerable idea of the horrid &s;cene that now en|&s;ued; men, women, and children were di&s;patched in the mo&s;t wanton and cruel manner, and immediately &s;calped. Many of the&s;e &s;avages drank the blood of their victims, as it flowed warm from the fatal wound.</P>
<P>We now perceived, though too late to avail us, that we were to expect no relief from the French; and that, contrary to the agreement they had &s;o lately &s;igned to allow us a &s;ufficient force to protect us from the&s;e in|&s;ults, they tacitly permitted them; for I could plainly perceive the French officers walking about at &s;ome di&s;|tance, di&s;cour&s;ing together with apparent unconcern. For the honor of human nature I would hope that this flagrant breach of every &s;acred law, proceeded rather from the &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition of the Indians, which I ac|knowledge it is &s;ometimes almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to control, and which might now unexpectedly have arrived to a pitch not ea&s;ily to be re&s;trained, than to any premeditated de&s;ign in the French commander. An unprejudiced ob&s;erver would, however, be apt to conclude, that a body of ten thou&s;and chri&s;tian troops, mo&s;t chri&s;tian troops, had it in their power to prevent the ma&s;&s;acre from becoming &s;o general. But whatever was the cau&s;e from which it aro&s;e, the con&s;equences of it were dread|ful, and not to be parallelled in modern hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="021728_0177_0FB5346096C94080">As the circle in which I &s;tood inclo&s;ed by this time was much thinned, and death &s;eemed to be approaching with ha&s;ty &s;trides, it was propo&s;ed by &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;olute to make one vigorous effort, and endeavor to force our way through the &s;avages, the only probable method of pre&s;erving our lives that now remained. This, however de&s;perate, was re&s;olved on, and about twenty of us &s;prung at once into the mid&s;t of them.</P>
<P>In a moment we were all &s;eparated, and what was the fate of my companions I could not learn till &s;ome months after, when I found that only &s;ix or &s;even of them ef|fected their de&s;ign. Intent only on my own hazardous &s;ituation, I endeavored to make my way through my &s;avage enemies in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible. And I have often been a&s;toni&s;hed &s;ince, when I have recollected with what compo&s;ure I took, as I did, every nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep for my pre&s;ervation. Some I overturned, being at that time young and athletic, and others I pa&s;&s;ed by, dex|trou&s;ly avoiding their weapons; till at la&s;t two very &s;tout chiefs, of the mo&s;t &s;avage tribes, as I could di&s;tingui&s;h by their dre&s;s, who&s;e &s;trength I could not re&s;i&s;t, laid hold of me by each arm, and began to force me through the crowd.</P>
<P>I now re&s;igned my&s;elf to my fate, not doubting but that they intended to di&s;patch me, and then to &s;atiate their vengeance with my blood, as I found they were hurrying me towards a retired &s;wamp that lay at &s;ome di&s;tance. But before we had got many yards, an Engli&s;h gentleman of &s;ome di&s;tinction, as I could di&s;cover by his breeches, the only covering he had on, which were of fine &s;carlet velvet, ru&s;hed clo&s;e by us. One of the Indians in&s;tantly relinqui&s;hed his hold, and &s;pringing on this new object, endeavored to &s;eize him as his prey; but the gentleman being &s;trong, threw him on the ground, and would probably have got away, had not he who held my other arm, quitted me to a&s;&s;i&s;t his brother. I &s;eized the opportunity, and ha&s;tened away to join ano|ther party of Engli&s;h troops that were yet unbroken, and &s;tood in a body at &s;ome di&s;tance. But before I had taken many &s;teps, I ha&s;tily ca&s;t my eye towards the gentleman, and &s;aw the Indian's tomahawk ga&s;h into
<PB N="165" REF="021728_0178_0FB5346219E82808">
his back, and heard him utter his la&s;t groan; this added both to my &s;peed and de&s;peration.</P>
<P>I had left this &s;hocking &s;cene but a few yards, when a fine boy about twelve years of age, that had hitherto e&s;caped, came up to me, and begged that I would let him lay hold of me, &s;o that he might &s;tand &s;ome chance of getting out of the hands of the &s;avages. I told him that I would give him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power, and to this purpo&s;e bid him lay hold; but in a few mo|ments he was &s;oon from my &s;ide, and by his &s;hrieks I judge was &s;oon demoli&s;hed. I could not help forget|ting my own cares for a minute, to lament the fate of &s;o young a &s;ufferer; but it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible for me to take any methods to prevent it.</P>
<P>I now got once more into the mid&s;t of friends, but we were unable to afford each other any &s;uccor. As this was the divi&s;ion that had advanced the furthe&s;t from the fort, I thought there might be a po&s;&s;ibility (though but a bare one) of my forcing my way through the outer ranks of the Indians, and getting to a neighbor|ing wood, which I perceived at &s;ome di&s;tance. I was &s;till encouraged to hope by the almo&s;t miraculous pre&s;er|vation I had already experienced.</P>
<P>Nor were my hopes in vain, or the efforts I made ineffectual. Suffice it to &s;ay, that I reached the wood; but by the time I had penetrated a little way into it, my breath was &s;o exhau&s;ted that I threw my&s;elf into a brake, and lay for &s;ome minutes apparently at the la&s;t ga&s;p. At length I recovered the power of re&s;piration; but my apprehen&s;ions returned with all their former force, when I &s;aw &s;everal &s;avages pa&s;s by, probably in pur&s;uit of me, at no very great di&s;tance. In this &s;ituation I knew not whether it was better to proceed, or endeavor to conceal my&s;elf where I lay, till night came on; fearing, however, that they would return the &s;ame way, I thought it mo&s;t prudent to get further from the dread|ful &s;cene of my pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Accordingly, &s;triking into another part of the wood, I ha&s;tened on as fa&s;t as the briars and the lo&s;s of one of my &s;hoes would per|mit me; and after a &s;low progre&s;s of &s;ome hours, gain|ed a hill that overlooked the plain which I had ju&s;t
<PB N="166" REF="021728_0179_0FB5346A50483E50">
left, from whence I could di&s;cern that the bloody &s;torm &s;till raged with unabated fury.</P>
<P>But not to tire my readers, I &s;hall only add, that after pa&s;&s;ing three days without &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and enduring the &s;everity of the cold dews for three nights, I at length reached Fort Edward; where with proper care my body &s;oon recovered its wonted &s;trength, and my mind, as far as the recollection of the late melancholy events would permit, its u&s;ual compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>It was computed that fifteen hundred per&s;ons were killed or made pri&s;oners by the&s;e &s;avages during this fatal day. Many of the lattter were carried off by them and never returned. A few, through favorable acci|dents, found their way back to their native country, after having experienced a long and &s;evere captivity.</P>
<P>The brave Colonel Monro had ha&s;tened away, &s;oon after the confu&s;ion began, to the French camp to en|deavor to procure the guard agreed by the &s;tipulati|on; but his application proving ineffectual, he remain|ed there till General Webb &s;ent a party of troops to demand and protect him back to Fort Edward. But the&s;e unhappy occurrences, which would probably have been prevented, had he been left to pur&s;ue his own plans, together with the lo&s;s of &s;o many brave fellows, murdered in cold blood, to who&s;e valor he had been &s;o lately a witne&s;s, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, that he did not long &s;urvive. He died in about three months of a broken heart, and with truth might it be &s;aid, that he was an honor to his country.</P>
<P>I mean not to point out the following circum&s;tance as the immediate judgment of heaven, and intended as an atonement for this &s;laughter; but I cannot omit that very few of tho&s;e different tribes of Indians that &s;hared in it ever lived to return home. The &s;mall-pox, by means of their communication with the Europeans, found its way among them, and made an equal havoc to what they them&s;elves had done. The methods they pur&s;ued on the fir&s;t attack of that malignant di&s;order, to abate the fever attending it, rendered it fatal. Whil&s;t their blood was in a &s;tate of fermentation, and nature was &s;triving to throw out the peccant matter, they
<PB N="167" REF="021728_0180_0FB5346B18E55E08">
checked her operations by plunging into the water: the con&s;equence was that they died by hundreds. The few that &s;urvived were transformed by it into hideous objects, and bore with them to the grave deep-indented marks of this much dreaded di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Montcalm fell &s;oon after on the plains of Quebec.</P>
<P>That the unprovoked cruelty of this commander was not approved of by the generality of his countrymen, I have &s;ince been convinced of by many proofs. One only, however, which I received from a per&s;on who who was witne&s;s to it, &s;hall I at pre&s;ent give. A Canadian merchant, of &s;ome con&s;ideration, having heard of the &s;urrender of the Engli&s;h fort, celebrated the fortunate event with great rejoicings and ho&s;pitality, according to the cu&s;tom of that country; but no &s;ooner did the news of the ma&s;&s;acre which en&s;ued reach his ears, than he put an immediate &s;top to the fe&s;tivity, and exclaimed in the &s;evere&s;t terms again&s;t the inhuman permi&s;&s;ion; declaring at the &s;ame time that tho&s;e who had con|nived at it, had thereby drawn down, on that part of their king's dominions the vengeance of Heaven. To this he added, that he much feared the total lo&s;s of them would de&s;ervedly be the con&s;equence. How truly this prediction has been verified we all know.</P>
<P>But to return&mdash;Though the Indians are negligent in guarding again&s;t &s;urpri&s;es, they are alert and dextrous in &s;urpri&s;ing their enemies. To their caution and per|&s;everance in &s;tealing on the party they de&s;ign to attack, they add that admirable talent, or rather in&s;tinctive qualification I have already de&s;cribed, of tracing out tho&s;e they are in pur&s;uit of. On the &s;moothe&s;t gra&s;s, on the harde&s;t earth, and even on the very &s;tones, will they di&s;cover the traces of an enemy, and by the &s;hape of the foot &s;teps, and the di&s;tance between the prints, di&s;tingui&s;h not only whether it is a man or woman who has pa&s;&s;ed that way, but even the nation to which they belong. However incredible this might appear, yet, from the many proofs I received whil&s;t among them of their amazing &s;agacity in this point, I &s;ee no rea&s;on to di&s;credit even the&s;e extraordinary exertions of it.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="021728_0181_0FB534735A124D18">When they have overcome an enemy, and victory is no longer doubtful, the conquerors fir&s;t di&s;patch all &s;uch as they think they &s;hall not be able to carry off with|out great trouble, and then endeavor to take as many pri&s;oners as po&s;&s;ible; after this they return to &s;calp tho&s;e who are either dead, or too much wounded to be taken with them.</P>
<P>At this bu&s;ine&s;s they are exceedingly expert. They &s;eize the head of the di&s;abled or dead enemy, and placing one of their feet on the neck, twi&s;t their left hand in the hair; by this means, having extended the &s;kin that covers the top of the head, they draw out their &s;calping knives, which are always kept in good order for this cruel purpo&s;e, and with a few dextrous &s;trokes take off the part that is termed the &s;calp. They are &s;o expeditious in doing this, that the whole time requir|ed &s;carcely exceeds a minute. The&s;e they pre&s;erve as monuments of their prowe&s;s, and at the &s;ame time as proofs of the vengeance they have inflicted on their ene|mies.</P>
<P>If two Indians &s;eize in the &s;ame in&s;tant a pri&s;oner, and &s;eem to have an equal claim, the conte&s;t between them is &s;oon decided; for to put a &s;peedy end to any di&s;pute that might ari&s;e, the per&s;on that is apprehen|&s;ive he &s;hall lo&s;e his expected reward, immediately has recour&s;e to his tomahawk or war-club, and knocks on the head the unhappy cau&s;e of their contention.</P>
<P>Having completed their purpo&s;es, and made as much havoc as po&s;&s;ible, they immediately retire towards their own country, with the &s;poil they have acquired, for fear of being pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Should this be the ca&s;e, they make u&s;e of many &s;tratagems to elude the &s;earches of their pur&s;uers. They &s;ometimes &s;catter leaves, &s;and, or du&s;t over the prints of their feet; &s;ometimes tread in each others foot&s;teps; and &s;ometimes lift their feet &s;o high, and tread &s;o light|ly, as not to make any impre&s;&s;ion on the ground. But if they find all the&s;e precautions unavailing, and that they are near being overtaken, they fir&s;t di&s;patch and &s;calp their pri&s;oners, and then dividing, each endeavors to regain his native country by a different route. This
<PB N="169" REF="021728_0182_0FB53474D9312C48">
prevents all further pur&s;uit; for their pur&s;uers now de|&s;pairing, either of gratifying their revenge, or of relea&s;|ing tho&s;e of their friends who were made captives, re|turn home.</P>
<P>If the &s;ucce&s;sful party is &s;o lucky as to make good their retreat unmole&s;ted, they ha&s;ten with the greate&s;t expedition to reach a country where they may be per|fectly &s;ecure; and that their wounded companions may not retard their flight, they carry them by turns in litters, or if it is in the winter &s;ea&s;on draw them on &s;ledges.</P>
<P>Their litters are made in a rude manner of the branch|es of trees. Their &s;ledges con&s;i&s;t of two &s;mall thin boards, about a foot wide when joined, and near &s;ix feet long. The fore-part is turned up, and the &s;ides are bordered with &s;mall bands. The Indians draw the&s;e car|riages with great ea&s;e, be they ever &s;o much loaded, by means of a &s;tring which pa&s;&s;es round the brea&s;t. This collar is called a Metump, and is in u&s;e throughout America, both in the &s;ettlements and the internal parts. Tho&s;e u&s;ed in the latter are made of leather, and very curiou&s;ly wrought.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners during their march are guarded with the greate&s;t care. During the day, if the journey is over land, they are always held by &s;ome of the victori|ous party; if by water, they are fa&s;tened to the canoe. In the night-time they are &s;tretched along the ground quite naked, with their legs, arms, and neck fa&s;tened to hooks fixed in the ground. Be&s;ides this, cords are tied to their arms or legs, which are held by an In|dian, who in&s;tantly awakes at the lea&s;t motion of them.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding &s;uch precautions are u&s;ually taken by the Indians, it is recorded in the annals of New-England, that one of the weaker &s;ex, almo&s;t alone, and una&s;&s;i&s;ted, found means to elude the vigilance of a party of warriors, and not only to make her e&s;cape from them, but to revenge the cau&s;e of her countrymen.</P>
<P>Some years ago, a &s;mall band of Canadian Indians, con&s;i&s;ting of ten warriors attended by two of their wives, made an irruption into the back &s;ettlements of New-England. They lurked for &s;ome time in the vicinity
<PB N="170" REF="021728_0183_0FB5347D1EAF83B8">
of one of the mo&s;t exterior towns, and at length, af|ter having killed and &s;calped &s;everal people, found means to take pri&s;oner a woman who had with her a &s;on of about twelve years of age. Being &s;atisfied with the execution they had done, they retreated towards their native country, which lay at three hundred miles di&s;|tance, and carried off with them their two captives.</P>
<P>The &s;econd night of their retreat, the woman, who&s;e name, if I mi&s;take not, was Rowe, formed a re&s;olution worthy of the mo&s;t intrepid heroe. She thought &s;he &s;hould be able to get from her hands the manacles by which they were confined, and determined if &s;he did &s;o to make a de&s;perate effort for the recovery of her free|dom. To this purpo&s;e, when &s;he concluded that her conquerors were in their &s;ounde&s;t &s;leep, &s;he &s;trove to &s;lip the cords from her hands. In this the &s;ucceeded; and cautioning her &s;on, whom they had &s;uffered to go unbound, in a whi&s;per, again&s;t being &s;urpri&s;ed at what &s;he was about to do, &s;he removed to a di&s;tance with great warine&s;s the defen&s;ive weapons of the Indians, which lay by their &s;ides.</P>
<P>Having done this, &s;he put one of the tomahawks in|to the hands of the boy, bidding him to follow her example; and taking another her&s;elf, fell upon the &s;leeping Indians, &s;everal of whom &s;he in&s;tantly di&s;patch|ed. But her attempt was nearly fru&s;trated by the im|becility of her &s;on, who wanting both &s;trength and re&s;olution, made a feeble &s;troke at one of them, which only &s;erved to awaken him; &s;he however &s;prung at the ri&s;ing warrior, and before he could recover his arms, made him &s;ink under the weight of her tomahawk; and this &s;he alternately did to all the re&s;t, except one of the women, who awoke in time, and made her e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The heroine then took off the &s;calps of her vanqui&s;h|ed enemies, and &s;eizing al&s;o tho&s;e they were carrying away with them as proofs of their &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he returned in triumph to the town from whence &s;he had &s;o lately been dragged, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of her neigh|bors, who could &s;carcely credit their &s;en&s;es, or the te&s;|timonies &s;he bore of her amazonian intrepidity.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="021728_0184_0FB53480407EC908">During their march they oblige their pri&s;oners to &s;ing their death-&s;ong, which generally con&s;i&s;ts of the&s;e or &s;imilar &s;entences: <Q>I am going to die, I am about to &s;uffer; but I will bear the &s;evere&s;t tortures my ene|mies can inflict, with becoming fortitude. I will die like a brave man, and I &s;hall then go to join the chiefs that have &s;uffered on the &s;ame account.</Q> The&s;e &s;ongs are continued with nece&s;&s;ary intervals, until they reach the village or camp to which they are going.</P>
<P>When the warriors are arrived within hearing, they &s;et up different cries, which communicates to their friends a general hi&s;tory of the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition. The number of the death-cries they give, declares how many of their own party are lo&s;t; the number of war-whoops, the number of pri&s;oners they have taken.</P>
<P>It it difficult to de&s;cribe the&s;e cries, but the be&s;t idea I can convey of them is, that the former con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ound Whoo, Whoo, Whoop, which is continued in a long &s;hrill tone, nearly till the breath is exhau&s;ted, and then broken off with a &s;udden elevation of the voice. The latter of a loud cry, of much the &s;ame kind, which is modulated into notes by the hand being placed before the mouth. Both of them might be heard to a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e are uttering, the per&s;ons to whom they are de&s;igned to convey the intelligence, continue moti|onle&s;s and all attention. When this ceremony is per|formed, the whole village i&s;&s;ue out to learn the particu|lars of the relation they have ju&s;t heard in general terms, and according as the news prove mournful or the con|trary, they an&s;wer by &s;o many acclamations or cries of lamentation.</P>
<P>Being by this time arrived at the village or camp, the women and children arm them&s;elves with &s;ticks and bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dgeons, and form them&s;elves into two ranks, through which the pri&s;oners are obliged to pa&s;s. The treatment they undergo before they reach the extremity of the line, is very &s;evere. Sometimes they are &s;o beaten over the head and face, as to have &s;carcely any remains of life; and happy would it be for them if by this u&s;age an end was put to their wretched beings. But their

tormentors take care that none of the blows they give prove mortal, as they wi&s;h to re&s;erve the mi&s;erable &s;uf|ferers for more &s;evere inflictions.</P>
<P>After having undergone this introductory di&s;cipline, they are bound hand and foot, whil&s;t the chiefs hold a council in which their fate is determined. Tho&s;e who are decreed to be put to death by the u&s;ual torments, are delivered to the chief of the warriors; &s;uch as are to be &s;pared, are given into the hands of the chief of the nation: &s;o that in a &s;hort time all the pri&s;oners may be a&s;&s;ured of their fate, as the &s;entence now pronounced is irrevocable. The former they term being con&s;igned to the hou&s;e of death, the latter to the hou&s;e of grace.</P>
<P>Such captives as are pretty far advanced in life, and have acquired great honor by their war-like deeds, al|ways atone for the blood they have &s;pilt, by the tor|tures of fire. Their &s;ucce&s;s in war is readily known by the blue marks upon their brea&s;ts and arms, which are as legible to the Indians as letters are to Europeans.</P>
<P>The manner in which the&s;e hieroglyphics are made, is by breaking the &s;kin with the teeth of fi&s;h, or &s;harp|ened flints, dipped in a kind of ink made of the foot of pitch pine. Like tho&s;e of the ancient Picts of Bri|tain the&s;e are e&s;teemed ornamental; and at the &s;ame time they &s;erve as regi&s;ters of the heroic actions of the warrior, who thus bears about him indelible marks of his valor.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners de&s;tined to death are &s;oon led to the place of execution, which is generally in the centre of the camp or village; where, being &s;tript, and every part of their bodies blackened, the &s;kin of a crow or raven is fixed on their heads. They are then bound to a &s;take, with faggots heaped around them, and obliged, for the la&s;t time, to &s;ing their death-&s;ong.</P>
<P>The warriors, for &s;uch it is only who commonly &s;uf|fer this puni&s;hment, now perform in a more prolix man|ner this &s;ad &s;olemnity. They recount with an audible voice all the brave actions they have performed, and pride them&s;elves in the number of enemies they have killed. In this rehear&s;al they &s;pare not even their tor|mentors, but &s;trive by every provoking tale they can in|vent,
<PB N="173" REF="021728_0186_0FB53484952B5B78">
to irritate and in&s;ult them. Sometimes this has the de&s;ired effect, and the &s;ufferers are di&s;patched &s;ooner than they otherwi&s;e would have been.</P>
<P>There are many other methods which the Indians make u&s;e of to put their pri&s;oners to death, but the&s;e are only occa&s;ional; that of burning is mo&s;t generally u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was at the chief town of the Ottagaumies, an Illinois Indian was brought in, who had been made pri&s;oner by one of their war-parties. I had then an opportunity of &s;eeing the cu&s;tomary cruelties inflicted by the&s;e people on their captives, through the minute&s;t part of their proce&s;s. After the previous &s;teps nece&s;|&s;ary to his condemnation, he was carried, early in the morning, to a little di&s;tance from the town, where he was bound to a tree.</P>
<P>This being done, all the boys, who amounted to a great number, as the place was populous, were permit|ted to amu&s;e them&s;elves with &s;hooting their arrows at the unhappy victim. As they were none of them more than twelve years old, and were placed at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, they had not &s;trength to penetrate to the vi|tal parts, &s;o that the poor wretch &s;tood pierced with arrows, and &s;uffering the con&s;equent agonies, for more than two days.</P>
<P>During this time he &s;ung his warlike exploits. He recapitulated every &s;tratagem he had made u&s;e of to &s;urpri&s;e his enemies: he boa&s;ted of the quantity of &s;calps he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and enumerated the pri&s;oners he had taken. He then de&s;cribed the different barbarous methods by which he had put the latter to death, and &s;eemed even then to receive inconceivable plea&s;ure from the recital of the horrid tale.</P>
<P>But he dwelt more particularly on the cruelties he had practi&s;ed on &s;uch of the kindred of his pre&s;ent tor|mentors, as had fallen into his hands; endeavoring by the&s;e aggravated in&s;ults to induce them to increa&s;e his tortures, that he might be able to give greater proofs of fortitude. Even in the la&s;t &s;truggles of life, when he was no longer able to vent in words the indignant provoca|tion
<PB N="174" REF="021728_0187_0FB5348D88013D78">
his tongue would have uttered, a &s;mile of mingled &s;corn and triumph &s;at on his countenance.</P>
<P>This method of tormenting their enemies is con&s;ider|ed by the Indians as productive of more than one be|neficial con&s;equence. It &s;atiates, in a greater degree, that diabolical lu&s;t of revenge, which is the predomi|nant pa&s;&s;ion in the brea&s;t of every individual of every tribe, and it gives the growing warriors an early propen|&s;ity to that cruelty and thir&s;t for blood, which is &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary a qualification for &s;uch as would be thoroughly &s;killed in their &s;avage art of war.</P>
<P>I have been informed, that an Indian who was under the hands of his tormentors, had the audacity to tell them, that they were ignorant old women, and did not know how to put brave pri&s;oners to death. He acquaint|ed them that he had heretofore taken &s;ome of their warriors, and in&s;tead of the trivial puni&s;hments they in|flicted on him, he had devi&s;ed for them the mo&s;t ex|cruciating torments; that having bound them to a &s;take, he had &s;tuck their bodies full of &s;harp &s;plinters of tur|pentine wood, to which he then &s;et fire, and dancing around them enjoyed the agonizing pangs of the flaming victim.</P>
<P>This bravado, which carried with it a degree of in|&s;ult, that even the accu&s;tomed ear of an Indian could not li&s;ten to unmoved, threw his tormentors off their guard, and &s;hortened the duration of his torments; for one of the chiefs ran to him, and ripping out his heart, &s;topped with it the mouth from which had i&s;&s;ued &s;uch provoking language.</P>
<P>Innumerable are the &s;tories that may be told of the courage and re&s;olution of the Indians, who happen to be made pri&s;oners by their adver&s;aries. Many that I have heard are &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing, that they &s;eem to exceed the utmo&s;t limits of credibility; it is, however, certain that the&s;e &s;avages are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with many heroic quali|ties, and bear every &s;pecies of misfortune with a degree of fortitude which has not been outdone by any of the ancient heroes either of Greece or of Rome.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e acts of &s;everity exerci&s;ed by the Indians towards tho&s;e of their own &s;pecies, who fall into
<PB N="175" REF="021728_0188_0FB5349096303CA0">
their hands, &s;ome tribes of them have been remarked for their moderation to &s;uch female pri&s;oners, belonging to the Engli&s;h colonies as have happened to be taken by them. Women of great beauty have frequently been carried off by them, and during a march of three or four hundred miles, through their retired fore&s;ts, have lain by their &s;ides without receiving any in&s;ult, and their cha&s;tity has remained inviolate. In&s;tances have happen|ed where female captives, who have been pregnant at the time of their being taken, have found the pangs of child-birth come upon them in the mid&s;t of &s;olitary woods, and &s;avages their only companions; yet from the&s;e, &s;avages as they were, have they received every a&s;&s;i&s;tance their &s;ituation would admit of, and been treat|ed with a degree of delicacy and humanity they little expected.</P>
<P>This forbearance, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, does not proceed altogether from their di&s;po&s;itions, but is only inherent in tho&s;e who have held &s;ome communication with the French mi&s;&s;ionaries. Without intending that their natural enemies, the Engli&s;h, &s;hould enjoy the be|nefit of their labours, the&s;e fathers have taken great pains to inculcate on the minds of the Indians the gene|ral principles of humanity, which has diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through their manners, and has proved of public utility.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e pri&s;oners that are con&s;igned to the hou&s;e of grace, and the&s;e are commonly the young men, women, and children, await the di&s;po&s;al of the chiefs, who, af|ter the execution of &s;uch as are condemned to die, hold a council for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A herald is &s;ent round the village or camp, to give notice that &s;uch as have lo&s;t any relation in the late ex|pedition, are de&s;ired to attend the di&s;tribution which is about to take place. Tho&s;e women who have lo&s;t their &s;ons or hu&s;bands, are generally &s;atisfied in the fir&s;t place; after the&s;e, &s;uch as have been deprived of friends of a more remote degree of con&s;anguinity, or who choo&s;e to adopt &s;ome of the youth.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion being made, which is done, as in other ca&s;es, without the lea&s;t di&s;pute, tho&s;e who have receiv|ed any &s;hare, lead them to their tents or huts; and hav|ing
<PB N="176" REF="021728_0189_0FB5349217147668">
unbound them, wa&s;h and dre&s;s their wounds if they happen to have received any; they then clothe them, and give them the mo&s;t comfortable and refre&s;hing food their &s;tore will afford.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t their new dome&s;tics are feeding, they endea|vor to admini&s;ter con&s;olation to them; they tell them that as they are redeemed from death, they mu&s;t now be cheerful and happy; and if they &s;erve them well, with|out murmuring or repining, nothing &s;hall be wanting to make them &s;uch atonement for the lo&s;s of their country and friends as circum&s;tances will allow of.</P>
<P>If any men are &s;pared, they are commonly given to the widows that have lo&s;t their hu&s;bands by the hand of the enemy, &s;hould there be any &s;uch, to whom, if they happen to prove agreeable, they are &s;oon married. But &s;hould the dame be otherwi&s;e engaged, the life of him who falls to her lot is in great danger; e&s;pecially if &s;he fancies that her late hu&s;band wants a &s;lave in the country of &s;pirits, to which he is gone.</P>
<P>When this is the ca&s;e, a number of young men take the devoted captive to &s;ome di&s;tance, and di&s;patch him without any ceremony: after he has been &s;pared by the council, they con&s;ider him of too little con&s;equence to be entitled to the torments allotted to tho&s;e who have been judged worthy of them.</P>
<P>The women are u&s;ually di&s;tributed to the men, from whom they do not fail of meeting with a favorable re|ception. The boys and girls are taken into the families of &s;uch as have need of them, and are con&s;idered as &s;laves; and it is not uncommon that they are &s;old in the &s;ame capacity to the European traders Who come among them.</P>
<P>The Indians have no idea of moderating the ravages of war, by &s;paring their pri&s;oners, and entering into a negotiation with the band from whom they have been taken, for an exchange. All that are captivated by both parties, are either put to death, adopted, or made &s;laves of. And &s;o particular are every nation in this re&s;pect, that if any of their tribe, even a warrior, &s;hould be taken pri&s;oner, and by chance be received in|to the hou&s;e of grace, either as an adopted per&s;on or
<PB N="177" REF="021728_0190_0FB53498578B8EB0">
a &s;lave, and &s;hould afterwards make his e&s;cape, they will by no means receive him, or acknowledge him as one of their band.</P>
<P>The condition of &s;uch as are adopted differs not in any one in&s;tance from the children of the nation to which they now belong. They a&s;&s;ume all the rights of tho&s;e who&s;e places they &s;upply, and frequently make no difficulty of going in the war-parties again&s;t their own countrymen. Should, however, any of the&s;e by chance make their e&s;cape, and be afterwards retaken, they are e&s;teemed as unnatural children and ungrateful per&s;ons, who have de&s;erted and made war upon their parents and benefactors, and are treated with uncommon &s;everity.</P>
<P>That part of the pri&s;oners which are con&s;idered as &s;laves, are generally di&s;tributed among the chiefs; who frequently make pre&s;ents of &s;ome of them to the Euro|pean governors of the out-po&s;ts, or to the &s;uperintend|ants or commi&s;&s;aries of Indian affairs. I have been in|formed that it was the Je&s;uits and French mi&s;&s;ionaries that fir&s;t occa&s;ioned the introduction of the&s;e unhappy captives into the &s;ettlements, and who by &s;o doing taught the Indians that they were valuable.</P>
<P>Their views indeed were laudable, as they imagined that by this method they &s;hould not only prevent much barbarity and blood&s;hed, but find the opportunities of &s;preading their religion among them increa&s;ed. To this purpo&s;e they encouraged the traders to purcha&s;e &s;uch &s;laves as they met with.</P>
<P>The good effects of this mode of proceeding was not however equal to the expectations of the&s;e pious fathers. In&s;tead of being the means of preventing cruelty and blood&s;hed, it only cau&s;ed the di&s;&s;en&s;ions between the In|dian nations to be carried on with a greater degree of violence, and with unremitted ardor. The prize they fought for being no longer revenge or fame, but the ac|quirement of &s;pirituous liquors, for which their captives were to be exchanged, and of which almo&s;t every nati|on is immoderately fond, they &s;ought for their enemies with unwonted alacrity, and were con&s;tantly on the watch to &s;urpri&s;e and carry them off.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="021728_0191_0FB5349B1AD2ED98">It might &s;till be &s;aid that fewer of the captives are tormented and put to death, &s;ince the&s;e expectations of receiving &s;o valuable a con&s;ideration for them have been excited than there u&s;ually had been; but it does not appear that their accu&s;tomed cruelty to the warriors they take, is in the lea&s;t abated; their natural de&s;ire of ven|geance mu&s;t be gratified; they now only become more a&s;&s;iduous in &s;ecuring a greater number of young pri&s;on|ers, whil&s;t tho&s;e who are made captive in their defence, are tormented and put to death as before.</P>
<P>The mi&s;&s;ionaries finding, that contrary to their wi&s;h|es, their zeal had only &s;erved to increa&s;e the &s;ale of the noxious juices, applied to the governor of Canada, in the year 1693, for a prohibition of this baneful trade. An order was i&s;&s;ued accordingly, but it could not put a total &s;top to it; the French Couriers de Bo&iuml;s were hardy enough to carry it on clande&s;tinely, notwith&s;tand|ing the penalty annexed to a breach of the prohibition was a con&s;iderable fine and impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>Some who were detected in the pro&s;ecution of it, withdrew into the Indian countries, where they inter-married with the natives, and underwent a voluntary ba|ni&s;hment. The&s;e however, being an abandoned and de|bauched &s;et, their conduct contributed very little either towards reforming the manners of their new relations, or engaging them to entertain a favorable opinion of the religion they profe&s;&s;ed. Thus did the&s;e indefatigable, religious men, &s;ee their de&s;igns in &s;ome mea&s;ure once more fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>However, the emigration was productive of an effect which turned out to be beneficial to their nation. By the connection of the&s;e refugees with the Iroquois, Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;uages, Hurons, Miamies, Powtowottomies, Pu|ants, Menomonies, Algonkins, &amp;c. and the con&s;tant repre&s;entations the&s;e various nations received from them of the power and grandeur of the French, to the ag|grandi&s;ement of who&s;e monarch, notwith&s;tanding their bani&s;hment, they &s;till retained their habitual inclination, the Indians became in&s;en&s;ibly prejudiced in favor of that people, and I am per&s;uaded will take every opportuni|ty of &s;hewing their attachment to them.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="021728_0192_0FB534A3A7802AD8">And this even in de&s;pite of the di&s;graceful e&s;timation they mu&s;t be held by them, &s;ince they have been driven out of Canada; for the Indians con&s;ider every conquer|ed people as in a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage to their conquerors. After one nation has finally &s;ubdued another, and a conditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is agreed on, it is cu&s;tomary for the chiefs of the conquered, when they &s;it in council with their &s;ubduers, to wear petticoats, as an acknow|ledgement that they are in a &s;tate of &s;ubjection, and ought to be ranked among the women. Their partiali|ty to the French has however taken too deep root for time it&s;elf to eradicate it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X. Of their Manner of making Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE wars that are carried on between the Indian nations are in general hereditary, and continue from age to age with a few interruptions. If a peace becomes nece&s;&s;ary, the principal care of both parties is to avoid the appearance of making the fir&s;t advances.</P>
<P>When they treat with an enemy, relative to a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities, the chief who is commi&s;&s;ioned to undertake the negotiation, if it is not brought about by the mediation of &s;ome neighboring band, abates nothing of his natural haughtine&s;s: even when the affairs of his country are in the wor&s;t &s;ituation, he makes no conce&s;&s;i|ons, but endeavors to per&s;uade his adver&s;aries that it is their intere&s;t to put an end to the war.</P>
<P>Accidents &s;ometimes contribute to bring about a peace between nations that otherwi&s;e could not be pre|vailed on to li&s;ten to terms of accomodation. An in|&s;tance of this, which I heard of in almo&s;t every nation I pa&s;&s;ed through, I &s;hall relate.</P>
<P>About eighty years ago, the Iroquois and Chip&eacute;|ways, two powerful nations, were at war with the Otta|gaumies
<PB N="180" REF="021728_0193_0FB534A4D873A0D8">
and Saukies, who were much inferior to their adver&s;aries both in numbers and &s;trength. One winter near a thou&s;and of the former made an excur&s;ion from Lake Ontario, by way of Toronto, towards the terri|tories of their enemies. They coa&s;ted Lake Huron on its ea&s;t and northern borders, till they arrived at the i&s;land of St. Jo&s;eph, which is &s;ituated in the Straits of St. Marie. There they cro&s;&s;ed the&s;e Straits upon the ice, about fifteen miles below the falls, and continued their route &s;till we&s;tward. As the ground was covered with &s;now, to prevent a di&s;covery of their numbers, they marched in a &s;ingle file, treading in each others foot|&s;teps.</P>
<P>Four Chip&eacute;way Indians, pa&s;&s;ing that way, ob&s;erved this army, and readily gue&s;&s;ed from the direction of their march, and the precautions they took, both the country to which they were ha&s;tening, and their de|&s;igns.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the nation to which they belonged was at war with the Ottagaumies, and in alliance with their invaders, yet from a principle which cannot be ac|counted for, they took an in&s;tant re&s;olution to appri&s;e the former of their danger. To this purpo&s;e they ha&s;|tened away with their u&s;ual celerity, and, taking a cir|cuit to avoid di&s;covery, arrived at the hunting grounds of the Ottagaumies, before &s;o large a body, moving in &s;o cautious a manner, could do. There they found a party of about four hundred warriors, &s;ome of which were Saukies, whom they informed of the approach of their enemies.</P>
<P>The chiefs immediately collected their whole force, and held a council on the &s;teps that were to be taken for their defence. As they were encumbered with their families, it was impo&s;&s;ible that they could retreat in time; they therefore determined to choo&s;e the mo&s;t ad|vantageous &s;pot, and to give the Iroquois the be&s;t re|ception in their power.</P>
<P>Not far from the place where they then happened to be, &s;tood two &s;mall lakes, between which ran a narrow neck of land about a mile in length, and only from twenty to forty yards in breadth. Concluding that the
<PB N="181" REF="021728_0194_0FB534A658948AA0">
Iroquois intended to pa&s;s through this defile, the united bands divided their little party into two bodies of two hundred each. One of the&s;e took po&s;t at the extremi|ty of the pa&s;s that lay neare&s;t to their hunting grounds, which they immediately fortified with a brea&s;t-work formed of pali&s;ades; whil&s;t the other body took a com|pa&s;s round one of the lakes, with a de&s;ign to hem their enemies in when they had entered the defile.</P>
<P>Their &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded; for no &s;ooner had the whole of the Iroquois entered the pa&s;s, than, being provided with wood for the purpo&s;e, they formed a &s;imilar brea&s;t-work on the other extremity, and thus enclo&s;ed their enemies.</P>
<P>The Iroquois &s;oon perceived their &s;ituation, and im|mediately held a council on the mea&s;ures that were nece&s;&s;ary to be pur&s;ued to extricate them&s;elves. Un|luckily for them a thaw had ju&s;t taken place, which had &s;o far di&s;&s;olved the ice as to render it impa&s;&s;ible, and yet there &s;till remained &s;ufficient to prevent them from either pa&s;&s;ing over the lakes on rafts, or from &s;wimming acro&s;s. In this dilemma it was agreed that they &s;hould endeavor to force one of the brea&s;t works; but they &s;oon found them too well defended to effect their pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;appointment, with the u&s;ual compo&s;ure and unapprehen&s;ivene&s;s of Indians, they amu&s;ed them&s;elves three or four days in fi&s;hing. By this time the ice being quite di&s;&s;olved, they made them|&s;elves rafts, which they were enabled to do by &s;ome trees that fortunately grew on the &s;pot, and attempt|ed to cro&s;s one of the lakes.</P>
<P>They accordingly &s;et off before day-break; but the Ottagaumies, who had been watchful of their motions, perceiving their de&s;ign, detatched one hundred and fif|ty men from each of their parties, to oppo&s;e their land|ing. The&s;e three hundred marched &s;o expeditiou&s;ly to the other &s;ide of the lake, that they reached it before their opponents had gained the &s;hore, they being re|tarded by their poles &s;ticking in the mud.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the confederates arrived, they poured in a very heavy fire, both from their bows and mu&s;quetry,
<PB N="182" REF="021728_0195_0FB534A7DA7DC8B8">
on the Iroquois, which greatly di&s;concerted them; till the latter finding their &s;ituation de&s;perate, leaped into the water, and fought their way through their enemies. This however they could not do without lo&s;ing more than half their men.</P>
<P>After the Iroquois had landed, they made good their retreat, but were obliged to leave their enemies ma&s;ters of the field, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the furs they had taken during their winter's hunt. Thus dearly did they pay for an unprovoked excur&s;ion to &s;uch a di&s;tance from the route they ought to have pur&s;ued, and to which they were only impelled by a &s;udden de&s;ire of cutting off &s;ome of their ancient enemies.</P>
<P>But had they known their &s;trength, they might have de&s;troyed every man of the party that oppo&s;ed them; which even at the fir&s;t on&s;et was only incon&s;iderable, and, when dimini&s;hed by the action, totally unable to make any &s;tand again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The victorious bands rewarded the Chip&eacute;ways, who had been the means of their &s;ucce&s;s, with a &s;hare of the &s;poils. They pre&s;&s;ed them to take any quantity they cho&s;e of the riche&s;t of the furs, and &s;ent them un|der an e&s;cort of fifty men, to their own country. The di&s;intere&s;ted Chip&eacute;ways, as the Indians in general are &s;eldom actuated by mercenary motives, for a con&s;idera|ble time refu&s;ed the&s;e pre&s;ents, but were at length per|&s;uaded to accept of them.</P>
<P>The brave and well-concerted re&s;i&s;tance here made by the Ottagaumies and Saukies, aided by the mediation of the Chip&eacute;ways, who laying a&s;ide on this occa&s;ion the animo&s;ity they had &s;o long borne tho&s;e people, approved of the generous conduct of their four chiefs, were to|gether the means of effecting a reconciliation between the&s;e nations; and in proce&s;s of time united them all in the bands of amity.</P>
<P>And I believe that all the Indians inhabiting that ex|ten&s;ive country which lies between Quebec, the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi north of the Oui&s;con&s;in, and the &s;et|tlements belonging to the Hud&s;on's Bay Company, are at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate of profound peace. When their re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;itions will not &s;uffer them to remain inac|tive,
<PB N="183" REF="021728_0196_0FB534B4915E6170">
the&s;e northern Indians &s;eldom commit ho&s;tilities on each other, but make excur&s;ions to the &s;outhward, again&s;t the Cherokees, Choctahs, Chick&s;aws, or Illinois.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Indians grow tired of a war which they have carried on again&s;t &s;ome neighboring nation for many years without much &s;ucce&s;s, and in this ca&s;e they &s;eek for mediators to begin a negotiation. The&s;e being obtained, the treaty is thus conducted:</P>
<P>A number of their own chiefs, joined by tho&s;e who have accepted the friendly office, &s;et out together for the country of their enemies; &s;uch as are cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e, are chiefs of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive abilities, and of the greate&s;t integrity. They bear before them the Pipe of Peace, which I need not inform my readers is of the &s;ame nature as a Flag of Truce among the Eu|ropeans, and is treated with the greate&s;t re&s;pect and veneration, even by the mo&s;t barbarous nations. I ne|ver heard of an in&s;tance wherein the bearers of this &s;a|cred badge of friend&s;hip were ever treated di&s;re&s;pectful|ly, or its rights violated. The Indians believe that the Great Spirit never &s;uffers an infraction of this kind to go unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Pipe of Peace, which is termed by the French the Calumet, for what rea&s;on I could never learn, is about four feet long. The bowl of it is made of red marble, and the &s;tem of it of a light wood, curiou&s;ly painted with hieroglyphics in various colors, and adorned with feathers of the mo&s;t beautiful birds; but it is not in my power to convey an idea of the various tints and plea&s;ing. ornaments of this much e&s;teemed Indian implement.</P>
<P>Every nation has a different method of decorating the&s;e pipes, and they can tell at fir&s;t &s;ight to what band it belongs. It is u&s;ed as an introduction to all treaties, and great ceremony attends the u&s;e of it on the&s;e occa|&s;ions.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;i&s;tant or aid-du-camp of the great warrior, when the chiefs are a&s;&s;embled and &s;eated, fills it with tobacco mixed with the herbs before mentioned, taking care at the &s;ame time that no part of it touches the ground. When it is filled, he takes a coal that is tho|roughly
<PB N="184" REF="021728_0197_0FB534B55C7DCAF0">
kindled, from a fire which is generally kept burning in the mid&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly, and places it on the tobacco.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it is &s;ufficiently lighted, he throws off the coal. He then turns the &s;tem of it towards the heavens, after this towards the earth, and now holding it horizontally, moves him&s;elf round till he has completed a circle: by the fir&s;t action he is &s;uppo&s;ed to pre&s;ent it to the Great Spirit, who&s;e aid is thereby &s;upplicated; by the &s;econd, to avert any malicious interpo&s;ition of the evil &s;pirits; and by the third to gain the protection of the &s;pirits inhabiting the air, the earth, and the waters. Having thus &s;ecured the favor of tho&s;e invi&s;ible agents, in who&s;e power they &s;uppo&s;e it is either to forward or ob&s;truct the i&s;&s;ue of their pre&s;ent deliberations, he pre&s;ents it to the heredit|ary chief, who having taken two or three whiffs, blows the &s;moke from his mouth fir&s;t towards heaven, and then around him upon the ground.</P>
<P>It is afterwards put in the &s;ame manner into the mouths of the amba&s;&s;adors or &s;trangers, who ob&s;erve the &s;ame ceremony, then to the chief of the warriors, and to all the other chiefs in turn, according to their gradation. During this time the per&s;on who executes this honorable office holds the pipe &s;lightly in his hand, as if he feared to pre&s;s the &s;acred in&s;trument; nor does any one pre&s;ume to touch it but with his lips.</P>
<P>When the chiefs who are intru&s;ted with the commi&s;&s;i|on for making peace, approach the town or camp to which they are going, they begin to &s;ing and dance the &s;ongs and dances appropriated to this occa&s;ion. By this time the adver&s;e party are appri&s;ed of their arrival, and, at the &s;ight of the Pipe of Peace, dive&s;ting them&s;elves of their wonted enmity invite them to the habitation of the Great Chief, and furni&s;h them with every conveni|ency during the negotiation.</P>
<P>A council is then held; and when the &s;peeches and debates are ended, if no ob&s;tructions ari&s;e to put a &s;top to the treaty, the painted hatchet is buried in the ground, as a memorial that all animo&s;ities between the contending nations have cea&s;ed, and a peace taken place. Among the ruder bands, &s;uch as have no com|munication
<PB N="185" REF="021728_0198_0FB534B6D6FE8150">
with the Europeans, a war-club, painted red, is buried, in&s;tead of the hatchet.</P>
<P>A belt of wampum is al&s;o given on this occa&s;ion, which &s;erves as a ratification of the peace, and records to the late&s;t po&s;terity, by the hieroglyphics into which the beads are formed, every &s;tipulated article in the treaty.</P>
<P>The&s;e belts are made of &s;hells found on the coa&s;ts of New England and Virginia, which are &s;awed out into beads of an oblong form, about a quarter of an inch long, and round like other beads. Being &s;trung on lea|ther &s;trings, and &s;everal of them &s;ewed neatly together with fine &s;inewy threads, they then compo&s;e what is termed a belt of Wampum.</P>
<P>The &s;hells are generally of two colors, &s;ome white and others violet; but the latter are more highly e&s;teem|ed than the former. They are held in as much e&s;tima|tion by the Indians, ad gold, &s;ilver, or precious &s;tones, are by the Europeans.</P>
<P>The belts are compo&s;ed of ten, twelve, or a greater number of &s;trings, according to the importance of the affair in agitation, or the dignity of the per&s;on to whom it is pre&s;ented. On more trifling occa&s;ions, &s;trings of the&s;e beads are pre&s;ented by the chiefs to each other, and frequently worn by them about their necks, as a va|luable ornament.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI. Of their Games.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have before ob&s;erved, the Indians are greatly addicted to gaming, and will even &s;take, and lo&s;e with compo&s;ure, all the valuables they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. They amu&s;e them&s;elves at &s;everal &s;orts of games, but the principal and mo&s;t e&s;teemed among them is that of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all, which is not unlike the European game of tennis.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="021728_0199_0FB534B85506ACD8">The balls they u&s;e are rather larger than tho&s;e made u&s;e of at tennis, and are formed of a piece of deer-&s;kin; which being moi&s;tened to render it &s;upple, is &s;tuffed hard with the hair of the &s;ame creature, and &s;ewed with its &s;inews. The ball-&s;ticks are about three feet long, at the end of which there is fixed a kind of racket, re&s;em|bling the palm of the hand, and fa&s;hioned of thongs cut from a deer-&s;kin. In the&s;e they catch the ball, and throw it to a great di&s;tance, if they are not prevented by &s;ome of the oppo&s;ite party, who fly to intercept it.</P>
<P>This game is generally played by large companies, that &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;t of more than three hundred; and it is not uncommon for different bands to play again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>They begin by fixing two poles In the ground at about &s;ix hundred yards apart, and one of the&s;e goals belong to each party of the combatants. The ball is thrown up high in the centre of the ground, and in a direct line be|tween the goals; towards which each party endeavors to &s;trike it, and which&s;oever &s;ide fir&s;t cau&s;es it to reach their own goal, reckons towards the game.</P>
<P>They are &s;o exceeding dextrous in this manly exerci&s;e, that the ball is u&s;ually kept flying in different directions by the force of the rackets, without touching the ground during the whole contention; for they are not allowed to catch it with their hands. They run with amazing velocity in pur&s;uit of each other, and when one is on the point of hurling it to a great di&s;tance, an antago|ni&s;t overtakes him, and by a &s;udden &s;troke da&s;hes down the ball.</P>
<P>They play with &s;o much vehemence that they fre|quently wound each other, and &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bone is bro|ken; but notwith&s;tanding the&s;e accidents there never appears to be any &s;pite or wanton exertions of &s;trength to effect them, nor do any di&s;putes ever happen between the parties.</P>
<P>There is another game al&s;o in u&s;e among them wor|thy of remark, and this is the game of the Bowl or Platter. This game is played between two per&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only. Each per&s;on has &s;ix or eight little bones not unlike a peach-&s;tone either in &s;ize or &s;hape, except that they are
<PB N="187" REF="021728_0200_0FB534C60BE07760">
quadrangular; two of the &s;ides of which are colored black, and the others white. The&s;e they throw up into the air, from whence they fall into a bowl or platter placed underneath, and made to &s;pin round.</P>
<P>According as the&s;e bones pre&s;ent the white or black &s;ide upwards they reckon the game; he that happens to have the greate&s;t number turn up of a &s;imilar color, counts five points; and forty is the game.</P>
<P>The winning party keeps his place, and the lo&s;er yields his to another who is appointed by one of the umpires; for a whole village is &s;ometimes concerned in the party, and at times one band plays again&s;t another.</P>
<P>During this play the Indians appear to be greatly agi|tated, and at every deci&s;ive throw &s;et up a hideous &s;hout. They make a thou&s;and contortions, addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves at the &s;ame time to the bones, and loading with impreca|tions the evil &s;pirits that a&s;&s;i&s;t their &s;ucce&s;sful antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>At this game &s;ome will lo&s;e their apparel, all the moveables of their cabins, and &s;ometimes even their li|berty, notwith&s;tanding there are no people in the uni|ver&s;e more jealous of the latter than the Indians are.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII. Of their Marriage Ceremonies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Indians allow of polygamy, and per&s;ons of every rank indulge them&s;elves in this point. The chiefs in particular have a &s;eraglio, which con&s;i&s;ts of an uncertain number, u&s;ually from &s;ix to twelve or fourteen. The lower ranks are permitted to take as many as there is a probability of their being able, with the children they may bear to maintain. It is not uncommon for an Indian to marry two &s;i&s;ters; &s;ometimes, if there happen to be more, the whole number; and notwith&s;tanding this (as it appears to civilized nations) unnatural union, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> live in the greate&s;t harmony.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="021728_0201_0FB534C698AECD48">The younger wives are &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the elder; and tho&s;e who have no children, do &s;uch menial offices for tho&s;e who are fertile, as cau&s;es their &s;ituation to differ but little from a &s;tate of &s;ervitude. However they per|form every injunction with the greate&s;t cheerfulne&s;s, in hopes of gaining thereby the affection of their hu&s;band, that they in their turns may have the happine&s;s of be|coming mothers, and be entitled to the re&s;pect attendant on that &s;tate.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon for an Indian, although he takes to him&s;elf &s;o many wives, to live in a &s;tate of continence with many of them for &s;everal years. Such as are not &s;o fortunate as to gain the favor of their hu&s;band, by their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and prudent behavior, and by that means to &s;hare in his embraces, continue in their virgin &s;tate during the whole of their lives, except they happen to be pre&s;ented by him to &s;ome &s;tranger chief, who&s;e abode among them will not admit of his entering into a more la&s;ting connection. In this ca&s;e they &s;ubmit to the in|junction of their hu&s;band without murmuring, and are not di&s;plea&s;ed at the temporary union. But if at any time it is known that they take this liberty without fir&s;t receiving; his con&s;ent, they are puni&s;hed in the &s;ame manner as if they had been guilty of adultery.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom is more prevalent among the nations which lie in the interior parts, than among tho&s;e that are nearer the &s;ettlements, as the manners of the latter are rendered more conformable in &s;ome points to tho&s;e of the Europeans, by the intercour&s;e they hold with them.</P>
<P>The Indian nations differ but little from each other in their marriage ceremonies, and le&s;s in the manner of their divorces. The tribes that inhabit the borders of Canada, make u&s;e of the following cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>When a young Indian has fixed his inclinations on one of the other &s;ex, he endeavors to gain her con&s;ent, and if he &s;ucceeds, it is never known that her parents ever ob&s;truct their union. When every preliminary is agreed on, and the day appointed, the friends and ac|quaintance of both parties a&s;&s;emble at the hou&s;e or tent
<PB N="189" REF="021728_0202_0FB534C817760310">
of the olde&s;t relation of the bridegroom, where a fea&s;t is prepared on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The company who meet to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the fe&s;tival are &s;ometimes very numerous; they dance, they &s;ing, and enter into every other diver&s;ion u&s;ually made u&s;e of on any of their public rejoicings.</P>
<P>When the&s;e are fini&s;hed, all tho&s;e who attended mere|ly out of ceremony depart, and the bridegroom and bride are left alone with three or four of the neare&s;t and olde&s;t relations of either &s;ide; tho&s;e of the bridegroom being men, and tho&s;e of the bride, women.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently the bride, attended by the&s;e few friends, having withdrawn her&s;elf for the purpo&s;e, appears at one of the doors of the hou&s;e, and is led to the bridegroom, who &s;tands ready to receive her. Having now taken their &s;tation, on a mat placed in the centre of the room, they lay hold of the extremities of a wand, about four feet long, by which they continue &s;eparated, whil&s;t the old men pronounce &s;ome &s;hort harangues &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The married couple after this make a public declara|tion of the love and regard they entertain for each other, and &s;till holding the rod between them, dance and &s;ing. When they have fini&s;hed this part of the ceremony, they break the rod into as many pieces as there are witne&s;&s;es pre&s;ent, who each take a piece, and pre&s;erve it with great care.</P>
<P>The bride is then reconducted out of the door at which &s;he entered, where her young companions wait to at|tend her to her father's hou&s;e; there the bridegroom is obliged to &s;eek her, and the marriage is con&s;ummated. Very often the wife remains at her father's hou&s;e till &s;he has a child, when &s;he packs up her apparel, which is all the fortune &s;he is generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and ac|companies her hu&s;band to his habitation.</P>
<P>When from any di&s;like a &s;eparation takes place, for they are &s;eldom known to quarrel, they generally give their friends a few days notice of their intentions, and &s;ometimes offer rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify their conduct. The witne&s;&s;es who were pre&s;ent at the marriage, meet on the day reque&s;ted, at the hou&s;e of the couple that are
<PB N="190" REF="021728_0203_0FB534C9967B8DE0">
about to &s;eparate, and bringing with them the pieces of rod which they had received at their nuptials, throw them into the fire, in the pre&s;ence of all the parties.</P>
<P>This is the whole of the ceremony required, and the &s;eparation is carried on without any murmurings or ill-will between the couple or their relations; and after a few months they are at liberty to marry again.</P>
<P>When a marriage is thus di&s;&s;olved, the children which have been produced from it, are equally divided between them; and as children are e&s;teemed a trea&s;ure by the In|dians, if the number happens to be odd, the woman is allowed to take the better half.</P>
<P>Though this cu&s;tom &s;eems to encourage &s;icklene&s;s and frequent &s;eparations, yet there are many of the Indians who have but one wife, and enjoy with her a &s;tate of connubial happine&s;s not to be exceeded in more refined &s;ocieties. There are al&s;o not a few in&s;tances of women pre&s;erving an inviolable attachment to their hu&s;bands, except in the ca&s;es beforementioned, which are not con&s;idered as either a violation of their cha&s;tity or fidelity.</P>
<P>Although I have &s;aid that the Indian nations differ very little from each other in their marriage ceremonies, there are &s;ome exceptions. The Naudowe&s;&s;ies have a &s;ingular method of celebrating their marriages, which &s;eems to bear no re&s;emblance to tho&s;e made u&s;e of by any other nation I pa&s;&s;ed through. When one of their young men has fixed on a young woman he approves of, he di&s;covers his pa&s;&s;ion to her parents, who give him an invitation to come and live with them in their tent.</P>
<P>He accordingly accepts the offer, and by &s;o doing en|gages to re&s;ide in it for a whole year, in the character of a menial &s;ervant. During this time he hunts, and brings all the game he kills to the family; by which means the father has an opportunity of &s;eeing whether he is able to provide for the &s;upport of his daughter and the children that might be the con&s;equence of their union. This however it only done whil&s;t they are young
<PB N="191" REF="021728_0204_0FB534D40CA9C688">
men, and for their fir&s;t wife, and not repeated like Ja|cob's &s;ervitudes.</P>
<P>When this period is expired, the marriage is &s;olem|nized after the cu&s;tom of the country, in the following manner: Three or four of the olde&s;t male relations of the bridegroom, and as many of the bride's, accompany the young couple from their re&s;pective tents, to an open part in the centre of the camp.</P>
<P>The chiefs and warriors being here a&s;&s;embled to re|ceive them, a party of the latter are drawn up in two ranks on each &s;ide of the bride and bridegroom immedi|ately on their arrival. Their principal chief then ac|quaints the whole a&s;&s;embly with the de&s;ign of their meeting, and tells them that the couple before them, mentioning at the &s;ame time their names, are come to avow publicly their intentions of living together as man and wife. He then a&s;ks the two young people alternately, whether they de&s;ire that the union might take place. Having declared with an audible voice that they do &s;o, the warriors fix their arrows, and di&s;charge them over the heads of the married pair; this done, the chief pro|nounces them man and wife.</P>
<P>The bridegroom then turns round, and bending his body, takes his wife on his back, in which manner he carries her amid&s;t the acclamations of the &s;pectators to to his tent. This ceremony is &s;ucceeded by the mo&s;t plentiful fea&s;t the new married man can afford, and &s;ongs and dances, according to the u&s;ual cu&s;tom, conclude the fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>Divorces happen &s;o &s;eldom among the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, that I had not an opportunity of learning how they are accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Adultery is e&s;teemed by them a heinous crime, and puni&s;hed with the greate&s;t rigor. The hu&s;band in the&s;e ca&s;es bites off the wife's no&s;e, and a &s;eparation in&s;tantly en&s;ues. I &s;aw an in&s;tance wherein this mode of puni&s;h|ment was inflicted, whil&s;t I remained among them. The children, when this happens, are di&s;tributed according to the u&s;ual cu&s;tom ob&s;erved by other nations, that is, they are equally divided.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="021728_0205_0FB534D4D6061B78">Among the Indian as well as European nations, there are many that devote them&s;elves to plea&s;ure, and not|with&s;tanding the accounts given by &s;ome modern writers of the frigidity of an Indian con&s;titution, become the zealous votaries of Venus. The young warriors that are thus di&s;po&s;ed, &s;eldom want opportunities for gratify|ing their pa&s;&s;ion; and as the mode u&s;ually followed on the&s;e occa&s;ions is rather &s;ingular, I &s;hall de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>When one of the&s;e young debauchees imagines from the behavior of the per&s;on he has cho&s;en for his mi&s;tre&s;s, that he &s;hall not meet with any great ob&s;truction to his &s;uit from her, he pur&s;ues the following plan.</P>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved, that the Indians ac|knowledge no &s;uperiority, nor have they any ideas of &s;ubordination, except in the nece&s;&s;ary regulations of their war or hunting parties; they con&s;equently live nearly in a &s;tate of equality, pur&s;uant to the fir&s;t principles of nature. The lover therefore is not apprehen&s;ive of any check or control in the accompli&s;hment of his purpo&s;es, if he can find a convenient opportunity for completing them.</P>
<P>As the Indians are al&s;o under no apprehen&s;ion of robbers, or &s;ecret enemies, they leave the doors of their tents or huts unfa&s;tened during the night, as well as in the day. Two or three hours after &s;un&s;et, the &s;laves or old people cover over the fire, that is generally burning in the mid&s;t of their apartment, with a&s;hes, and retire to their repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t darkne&s;s thus prevails, and all is quiet, one of the&s;e &s;ons of plea&s;ure, wrapped up clo&s;ely in his blan|ket, to prevent his being known, will &s;ometimes enter the apartment of his intended mi&s;tre&s;s. Having fir&s;t lighted at the &s;mothered fire a &s;mall &s;plinter of wood, which an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of a match, he approaches the place where &s;he repo&s;es, and gently pulling away the covering from the head, jogs her till &s;he awakes. If &s;he then ri&s;es up, and blows out the light, he needs no further confirmation that his company is not di&s;agreea|ble; but if, after he has di&s;covered him&s;elf, &s;he hides her head, and takes no notice of him, he might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="193" REF="021728_0206_0FB534D655624DE0">
that any further &s;olicitations will prove vain, and that it is nece&s;&s;ary immediately for him to retire.</P>
<P>During his &s;tay he conceals the light as much as po&s;&s;ible in the hollow of his hands, and as the tents or rooms of the Indians are u&s;ually large and capacious, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">apes without detection. It is &s;aid that the young women who admit their lovers on the&s;e occa&s;ions, take great care, by an immediate application to herbs, with the potent efficacy of which they are well acquainted, to prevent the effects of the&s;e illicit amors from becom|ing vi&s;ible; for &s;hould the natural con&s;equences en&s;ue, they mu&s;t forever remain unmarried.</P>
<P>The children of the Indians are always di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the mother: and if a woman marries &s;everal hu&s;bands, and has i&s;&s;ue by each of them, they are all called after her. The rea&s;on they give for this is, that as their offspring are indebted to the father for their &s;ouls, the invi&s;ible part of their e&s;&s;ence, and to the mother for their corporeal and apparent part, it is more rational that they &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the latter, from whom they indubitably derive their being, than by that of the father, to which a doubt might &s;ometimes ari&s;e whether they are ju&s;tly entitled.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome ceremonies made u&s;e of by the Indi|ans at the impo&s;ition of the name, and it is con&s;idered by them as a matter of great importance; but what the&s;e are I could never learn, through the &s;ecrecy ob&s;erved on the occa&s;ion. I only know that it is u&s;ually given when the children have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tate of infancy.</P>
<P>Nothing can exceed the tenderne&s;s &s;hown by them to their offspring; and a per&s;on cannot recommend him|&s;elf to their favor by any method more certain, than by paying &s;ome attention to the younger branches of their families. I can impute, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to the pre&s;ents I made to the children of the chiefs of the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, the ho&s;pitable reception I met with when among them.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome difficulty attends an explanation of the manner in which the Indians, di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from each other. Be&s;ides the name of the animal by which
<PB N="194" REF="021728_0207_0FB534D7D5D80A80">
every nation and tribe is denominated, there are others that are per&s;onal, and which the children receive from their mother.</P>
<P>The chiefs are al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by a name that has either &s;ome reference to their abilities, or to the hiero|glyphic of their families; and the&s;e are acquired after they arrive at the age of manhood. Such as have &s;ig|nalized them&s;elves either in their war or hunting parties, or are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome eminent qualification, receive a name that &s;erves to perpetuate the &s;ame of the&s;e actions, or to make their abilities con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>Thus the great warrior of the Naudowe&s;&s;ies was named Ottahtongoomli&s;hcah, that is, the Great Father of Snakes; ottah being in Engli&s;h father, tongoom great, and li&s;hcah a &s;nake. Another chief was called Honah|pawjatin, which means a &s;wift runner over the moun|tains. And when they adopted me a chief among them, they named me Shebaygo, which &s;ignifies a writer, or a per&s;on that is curious in making hieroglyphics, as they &s;aw me often writing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII. Of their Religion.</HEAD>
<P>IT is very difficult to attain a perfect knowledge of the religious principles of the Indians. Their cere|monies and doctrines have been &s;o often ridiculed by the Europeans, that they endeavor to conceal them; and if, after the greate&s;t intimacy, you de&s;ire any of them to explain to you their &s;y&s;tem of religion, to prevent your ridicule, they intermix with it many of the tenets they have received from the French mi&s;&s;iona|ries, &s;o that it is at la&s;t rendered an unintelligible jargon, and not to be depended upon.</P>
<P>Such as I could di&s;cover among the Naudowe&s;&s;ies (for they al&s;o were very re&s;erved in this point) I &s;hall give
<PB N="195" REF="021728_0208_0FB534DE18FD85A0">
my readers, without paying any attention to the accounts of others. As the religion of that people from their &s;ituation appears to be totally unadulterated with the &s;uper&s;titions of the church of Rome, we &s;hall be able to gain from their religious cu&s;toms a more perfect idea of the original tenets and ceremonies of the Indians in general, than from tho&s;e of any nations that approach nearer to the &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>It it certain they acknowledge one Supreme Being, or Giver of Life, who pre&s;ides over all things. The Chip&eacute;ways call this Being Manitou, or Kitchi-Maniton; the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, Wakon or Tongo-Wakon, that is, the Great Spirit; and they look up to him as the &s;ource of good, from whom no evil can proceed. They al&s;o believe in a bad &s;pirit, to whom they a&s;cribe great pow|er, and &s;uppo&s;e that through his means all the evils which befal mankind are inflicted. To him therefore do they pray in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, begging that he would either avert their troubles, or moderate them when they are no longer avoidable.</P>
<P>They &s;ay that the Great Spirit, who is infinitely good, neither wi&s;hes or is able to do any mi&s;chief to mankind; but on the contrary, that he &s;howers down on them all the ble&s;&s;ings they de&s;erve; whereas the evil &s;pirit is con|tinually employed in contriving how he may puni&s;h the human race; and to do which he is not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the will, but of the power.</P>
<P>They hold al&s;o that there are good &s;pirits of a le&s;&s;er degree, who have their particular departments, in which they are con&s;tantly contributing to the happine&s;s of mor|tals. The&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e to pre&s;ide overall the extraor|dinary productions of nature, &s;uch as tho&s;e lakes, rivers, or mountains that are of an uncommon magnitude; and likewi&s;e the bea&s;ts, birds, fi&s;hes, and even vegetables, or &s;tones that exceed the re&s;t of their &s;pecies in &s;ize or &s;ingularity. To all of the&s;e they pay &s;ome kind of ado|ration. Thus when they arrive on the borders of Lake Superior, on the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, or any other great body of water, they pre&s;ent to the Spirit who re&s;ides there &s;ome kind of offering, as the prince of the
<PB N="196" REF="021728_0209_0FB534E254CE08D8">
Winnebagoes did when he attended me to the Falls of St. Anthony.</P>
<P>But at the &s;ame time I fancy that the ideas they an|nex to the word &s;pirit, are very different from the con|ceptions more enlightened nations entertain of it. They appear to fa&s;hion to them&s;elves corporeal repre&s;entations of their gods, and believe them to be of a human form, though of a nature more excellent than man.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame kind are their &s;entiments relative to a futurity. They doubt not but they &s;hall exi&s;t in &s;ome future &s;tate; they however fancy that their employments there will be &s;imilar to tho&s;e they are engaged in here, without the labor and difficulties annexed to them in this period of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>They con&s;equently expect to be tran&s;lated to a de|lightful country, where they &s;hall always have a clear unclouded &s;ky, and enjoy a perpetual &s;pring; where the fore&s;ts will abound with game, and the lakes with fi&s;h, which might be taken without requiring a painful exertion of &s;kill, or a laborious pur&s;uit; in &s;hort, that they &s;hall live for ever in regions of plenty, and enjoy every gratification they delight in here, in a greater degree.</P>
<P>To intellectual plea&s;ures they are &s;trangers; nor are the&s;e included in their &s;cheme of happine&s;s. But they expect that even the&s;e animal plea&s;ures will be pro|portioned and di&s;tributed according to their merit; the &s;kilful hunter, the bold and &s;ucce&s;sful warrior, will be entitled to a greater &s;hare than tho&s;e who through in|dolence or want of &s;kill cannot boa&s;t of any &s;uperiority over the common herd.</P>
<P>The prie&s;ts of the Indians are at the &s;ame time their phy&s;icians, and their conjurors; whil&s;t they heal their wounds, or cure their di&s;ea&s;es, they interpret their dreams, give them protective charms, and &s;atisfy that de&s;ire which is &s;o prevalent among them, of &s;earching into futurity.</P>
<P>How well they execute the latter part of their pro|fe&s;&s;ional engagements, and the methods they make u&s;e of on &s;ome of the&s;e occa&s;ions, I have already &s;hewn in the exertions of the prie&s;t of the Killi&s;tinoes, who was

fortunate enough to &s;ucceed in his extraordinary at|tempt near Lake Superior. They frequently are &s;uc|ce&s;sful likewi&s;e in admini&s;tering the &s;alubrious herbs they have acquired a knowledge of; but that the ceremonies they make u&s;e of during the admini&s;tration of them contributes to their &s;ucce&s;s, I &s;hall not take upon me to a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P>When any of the people are ill, the per&s;on who is in|ve&s;ted with this triple character of doctor, prie&s;t, and magician, &s;its by the patient day and night, rattling in his ears a gourd-&s;hell filled with dry beans, called a Chi|chicou&eacute;, and making a di&s;agreeable noi&s;e that cannot be well de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>This uncouth harmony one would imagine &s;hould di&s;|turb the &s;ick per&s;on, and prevent the good effects of the doctor's pre&s;cription; but on the contrary they believe that the method made u&s;e of contributes to his recovery, by diverting from his malignant purpo&s;es the evil &s;pirit who has inflicted the di&s;order; or at lea&s;t that it will take off his attention, &s;o that he &s;hall not increa&s;e the malady. This they are credulous enough to imagine he is con&s;tantly on the watch to do, and would carry his inveteracy to a fatal length if they did not thus charm him.</P>
<P>I could not di&s;cover that they make u&s;e of any other religious ceremonies than tho&s;e I have de&s;cribed; in|deed, on the appearance of the new-moon they dance and &s;ing; but it is not evident that they pay that planet any adoration; they only &s;eem to rejoice at the return of a luminary that makes the night cheerful, and which &s;erves to light them on their way when they travel dur|ing the ab&s;ence of the &s;un.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Mr. Adair has a&s;&s;erted that the nati|ons among whom he re&s;ided, ob&s;erve with very little variation all the rites appointed by the Mo&s;aic Law, I own I could never di&s;cover among tho&s;e tribes that lie but a few degrees to the north-we&s;t, the lea&s;t traces of the Jewi&s;h religion, except it be admitted that one par|ticular female cu&s;tom and their divi&s;ion into tribes, car|ry with them proofs &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h this a&s;&s;erti|on.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="021728_0211_0FB534E6158C8678">The Je&s;uits and French mi&s;&s;ionaries have al&s;o pretend|ed that the Indians had, when they fir&s;t travelled into America, &s;ome notions, though the&s;e were dark and confu&s;ed, of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution; that they have been greatly agitated at the fight of a cro&s;s, and given proofs, by the impre&s;&s;ions made on them, that they were not entirely unacquainted with the &s;acred my&s;teries of Chri&s;|tianity. I need not &s;ay that the&s;e are too glaring ab|&s;urdities to be credited, and could only receive their ex|i&s;tence from the zeal of tho&s;e fathers, who endeavored at once to give the public a better opinion of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of their mi&s;&s;ions, and to add &s;upport to the cau&s;e they were engaged in.</P>
<P>The Indians appear to be in their religious principles, rude and unin&s;tructed. The doctrines they hold are few and &s;imple, and &s;uch as have been generally impre&s;|&s;ed on the human mind, by &s;ome means or other, in the mo&s;t ignorant ages. They however have not deviated, as many other uncivilized nations, and too many civilized ones have done, into idolatrous modes of wor&s;hip; they venerate indeed, and make offerings to the wonderful parts of the creation, as I have before ob&s;erved; but but whether the&s;e rites are performed on account of the impre&s;&s;ion &s;uch extraordinary appearances make on them, or whether they con&s;ider them as the peculiar charge, or the u&s;ual places of re&s;idence of the invi&s;ible &s;pirits they acknowledge, I cannot po&s;itively determine.</P>
<P>The human mind in its uncultivated &s;tate is apt to a&s;cribe the extraordinary occurrences of nature, &s;uch as earthquakes, thunder, or hurricanes, to the interpo&s;iti|on of un&s;een beings; the troubles and di&s;a&s;ters al&s;o that are annexed to a &s;avage life, the apprehen&s;ions attend|ant on a precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and tho&s;e numberle&s;s in|conveniences which man in his improved &s;tate has found means to remedy, are &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from the interpo&s;ition of evil &s;pirits; the &s;avage con&s;equently lives in continual apprehen&s;ions of their unkind attacks, and to avert them has recour&s;e to charms, to the fanta&s;tic ceremonies of his prie&s;t, or the powerful influence of his Manitous. Fear has of cour&s;e a greater &s;hare in his devotions than gratitude, and he pays more attention
<PB N="199" REF="021728_0212_0FB534ECE60B0F38">
to deprecating the wrath of the evil than to &s;ecuring the favor of the good beings.</P>
<P>The Indians, however, entertain the&s;e ab&s;urdities in common with tho&s;e of every part of the globe who have not been illumined by that religion which only can di&s;per&s;e the clouds of &s;uper&s;tition and ignorance, and they are as free from error as a people can be that has not been favored with its in&s;tructive doctrines.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV. Of their Di&s;ea&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Indians in general are healthy, and &s;ubject but to few di&s;ea&s;es, many of tho&s;e that afflict ci|vilized nations, and are the immediate con&s;equences of luxury or &s;loth, being not known among them; how|ever, the hard&s;hips and fatigues which they endure in hunting or war, the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;ons to which they are continually expo&s;ed, but above all the extremes of hunger, and that voraciou&s;ne&s;s their long excur&s;ions con&s;equently &s;ubject them to, cannot fail of impairing the con&s;titution, and bringing on di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Pains and weakne&s;&s;es in the &s;tomach and brea&s;t are &s;ometimes the re&s;ult of their long fa&s;ting, and con&s;ump|tions of the exce&s;&s;ive fatigue and violent exerci&s;es they expo&s;e them&s;elves to from their infancy, before they have &s;ufficient &s;trength to &s;upport them. But the di&s;order to which they are mo&s;t &s;ubject, is the pleuri&s;y; for the removal of which, they apply their grand remedy and pre&s;ervative again&s;t the generality of their complaints, &s;weating.</P>
<P>The manner in which they con&s;truct their &s;toves for this purpo&s;e is as follows: They fix &s;everal &s;mall poles in the ground, the tops of which they twi&s;t together, &s;o as to form a rotunda: this frame they cover with &s;kins or blankets; and they lay them on with &s;o much
<PB N="200" REF="021728_0213_0FB534EF88E081B8">
nicety, that the air is kept from entering through any crevice; a &s;mall &s;pace being only left, ju&s;t &s;ufficient to creep in at, which is immediately after clo&s;ed. In the middle of this confined building they place red hot &s;tones, on which they pour water till a &s;team ari&s;es that produces a great degree of heat.</P>
<P>This cau&s;es an in&s;tantaneous per&s;piration, which they increa&s;e as they plea&s;e. Having continued in it for &s;ome time, they immediately ha&s;ten to the neare&s;t &s;tream, and plunge into the water; and, after bathing therein for about half a minute, they put on their clothes, &s;it down and &s;moke with great compo&s;ure, thoroughly per&s;uaded that the remedy will prove efficacious. They often make u&s;e of this &s;udoriferous method to refre&s;h them&s;elves, or to prepare their minds for the management of any bu&s;i|ne&s;s that requires uncommon deliberation and &s;agacity.</P>
<P>They are likewi&s;e afflicted with the drop&s;y and pa|ralytic complaints, which, however, are but very &s;eldom known among them. As a remedy for the&s;e as well as for fevers they make u&s;e of lotions and decoctions, com|po&s;ed of herbs, which the phy&s;icians know perfectly well how to compound and apply. But they never tru&s;t to medicines alone; they always have recour&s;e like|wi&s;e to &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies, without which their patients would not think the phy&s;ical preparations &s;ufficiently powerful.</P>
<P>With equal judgment they make u&s;e of &s;imples for the cure of wounds, fractures, or brui&s;es; and are able to extract by the&s;e, without inci&s;ion, &s;plinters, iron, or any other &s;ort of matter by which the wound is cau&s;ed. In cures of this kind they are extremely dextrous, and complete them in much le&s;s time than might be expect|ed from their mode of proceeding.</P>
<P>With the &s;kin of a &s;nake, which tho&s;e reptiles annu|ally &s;hed, they will al&s;o extract &s;plinters. It is amazing to &s;ee the &s;udden efficacy of this application, notwith|&s;tanding there does not appear to be the lea&s;t moi&s;ture remaining in it.</P>
<P>It has long been a &s;ubject of di&s;pute, on what conti|nent the venereal di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t received its de&s;tructive power. This dreadful malady is &s;uppo&s;ed to have ori|ginated
<PB N="201" REF="021728_0214_0FB534F09859B420">
in America, but the literary conte&s;t &s;till remains undecided; to give &s;ome elucidation to it I &s;hall remark, that as I could not di&s;cover the lea&s;t traces among the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, with whom I re&s;ided &s;o long, and was al&s;o informed that it was yet unknown among the more we&s;t|ern nations, I think I may venture to pronounce that it had not its origin in North-America. Tho&s;e nations that have any communication with the Europeans, or the &s;outhern tribes, are greatly afflicted with it; but they have all of them acquired a knowledge of &s;uch certain and expeditious remedies, that the communicati|on is not attended with any dangerous con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Soon after I &s;et out on my travels, one of the tra|ders whom I accompanied, complained of a violent go|norrhoea, with all its alarming &s;ymptoms: this increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that by the time we had reached the town of the Winnebagoes, he was unable to travel. Having made his complaint known to one of the chiefs of that tribe, he told him not to be unea&s;y, for he would engage that by following his advice, he &s;hould be able in a few days to pur&s;ue his journey, and in a lit|tle longer time be entirely free from his di&s;order.</P>
<P>The chief had no &s;ooner &s;aid this than he prepared for him a decoction of the bark of the roots of the prickly a&s;h, a tree &s;carcely known in England, but which grows in great plenty throughout North-America; by the u&s;e of which, in a few days he was greatly recover|ed, and having received directions how to prepare it, in a fortnight after his departure from this place per|ceived that he was radically cured.</P>
<P>If from exce&s;&s;ive exerci&s;e, or the extremes of heat or cold, they are affected with pains in their limbs or joints, they &s;carify the parts affected. Tho&s;e nations who have no commerce with Europeans do this with a &s;harp flint; and it is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee to how fine a point they have the dexterity to bring them; a lancet can &s;carcely exceed in &s;harpne&s;s the in&s;truments they make of this unmalleable &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>They never can be convinced a per&s;on is ill, whil&s;t he has an appetite; but when he rejects all kind of nou|ri&s;hment, they con&s;ider the di&s;ea&s;e as dangerous, and pay
<PB N="202" REF="021728_0215_0FB534F7F6BB0838">
great attention to it; and during the continuance of the di&s;order, the phy&s;ician refu&s;es his patient no &s;ort of food that he is de&s;irous of.</P>
<P>Their doctors are not only &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;killed in the phy&s;ical treatment of di&s;ea&s;es; but the common people believe that by the ceremony of the Chichicou&eacute; u&s;ually made u&s;e of, as before de&s;cribed, they are able to gain intelligence from the &s;pirits, of the cau&s;e of the com|plaints with which they are afflicted, and are thereby the better enabled to find remedies for them. They di&s;|cover &s;omething &s;upernatural in all their di&s;ea&s;es, and the phy&s;ic admini&s;tered mu&s;t invariably be aided by the&s;e &s;uper&s;titions.</P>
<P>Sometimes a &s;ick per&s;on fancies that his di&s;order ari&s;es from witchcraft; in this ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the phy&s;ician or juggler is con&s;ulted, who, after the u&s;ual preparations, gives his opinion on the &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, and frequently finds &s;ome means for his cure. But notwith&s;tanding the In|dian phy&s;icians always annex the&s;e &s;uper&s;titious ceremo|nies to their pre&s;criptions, it is very certain, as I have already ob&s;erved, that they exerci&s;e their art by prin|ciples which are founded on the knowledge of &s;imples, and on experience, which they acquire by an indefati|gable attention to their operations.</P>
<P>The following &s;tory, which I received from a per&s;on of undoubted credit, proves that the Indians are not only able to rea&s;on with great acutene&s;s on the cau&s;es and &s;ymptoms of many of the di&s;orders which are at|tendant on human nature, but to apply with equal judg|ment proper remedies.</P>
<P>In Penob&s;cot, a &s;ettlement in the province of Main, in the north-ea&s;t parts of New-England, the wife of a &s;oldier was taken in labor, and notwith&s;tanding every nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance was given her, could not be deliver|ed. In this &s;ituation &s;he remained for two or three days, the per&s;ons around her expecting that the next pang would put an end to her exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>An Indian woman, who accidentally pa&s;&s;ed by, heard the groans of the unhappy &s;ufferer, and enquired from whence they proceeded. Being made acquainted with the de&s;perate circum&s;tances attending the ca&s;e, &s;he told
<PB N="203" REF="021728_0216_0FB534FA55C8BC88">
the informant, that if &s;he might he permitted to &s;ee the per&s;on, &s;he did not doubt but that &s;he could be of great &s;ervice to her.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon that had attended, and the midwife who was then pre&s;ent, having given up every hope of pre&s;erv|ing their patient, the Indian woman was allowed to make u&s;e of any methods &s;he thought proper. She ac|cordingly took a handkerchief, and bound it tight over the no&s;e and mouth of the woman: this immediately brought on a &s;uffocation; and from the &s;truggles that con&s;equently en&s;ued, &s;he was in a few &s;econds delivered. The moment this was atchieved, and time enough to prevent any fatal effect, the handkerchief was taken off. The long-&s;uffering patient thus happily relieved from her pains, &s;oon after perfectly recovered, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all tho&s;e who had been witne&s;s to her de&s;perate &s;i|tuation.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on given by the Indian for this hazardous method of proceeding was, that de&s;perate di&s;orders re|quire de&s;perate remedies; that as &s;he ob&s;erved the exer|tions of nature were not &s;ufficiently forcible to effect the de&s;ired con&s;equence, &s;he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to aug|ment their force, which could only be done by &s;ome mode that was violent is the extreme.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XV. Of the Manner in which they treat their Dead.</HEAD>
<P>AN Indian meets death when it approaches him in his hut, with the &s;ame re&s;olution he has often faced him in the field. His indifference relative to this important article, which is the &s;ource of &s;o many ap|prehen&s;ions to almo&s;t every other nation, is truly admi|rable. When his fate is pronounced by the phy&s;ician,
<PB N="204" REF="021728_0217_0FB534FBD66CCC88">
and it remains no longer uncertain, he harangues tho&s;e about him with the greate&s;t compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>If he is a chief and has a family, he makes a kind of funeral oration, which he concludes by giving to his children &s;uch advice for the regulation of their conduct as he thinks nece&s;&s;ary. He then takes leave of his friends, and i&s;&s;ues out orders for the preparation of a fea&s;t, which is de&s;igned to regale tho&s;e of his tribe that come to pronounce his eulogium.</P>
<P>After the breath is departed, the body is dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame attire it u&s;ually wore whil&s;t living, his face is painted, and he &s;eated in an erect po&s;ture on a mat or &s;kin, placed in the middle of the hut, with his weapons by his &s;ide. His relations being &s;eated round, each ha|rangues in turn the decea&s;ed; and if he has been a great warrior, recounts his heroic actions nearly to the follow|ing purport, which in the Indian language is extreme|ly poetical and plea&s;ing:</P>
<P><Q>You &s;till &s;it among us, Brother, your per&s;on retains its u&s;ual re&s;emblance, and continues &s;imilar to ours, without any vi&s;ible deficiency, except that it has lo&s;t the power of action. But whither is that breath flown, which a few hours ago &s;ent up &s;moke to the Great Spirit? Why are tho&s;e lips &s;ilent, that late|ly delivered to us expre&s;&s;ive and plea&s;ing language? why are tho&s;e feet motionle&s;s, that a &s;hort time ago were fleeter than the deer on yonder mountains? why u&s;ele&s;s hang tho&s;e arms that could climb the talle&s;t tree, or draw the toughe&s;t bow? Alas! every part of that frame which we lately beheld with admiration and wonder, is now become as inanimate as it was three hundred winters ago. We will not, however, bemoan thee as if thou wa&s;t for ever lo&s;t to us, or that thy name would be buried in oblivion; thy &s;oul yet lives in the great Country of Spirits, with tho&s;e of thy nation that are gone before thee; and though we are left behind to perpetuate thy fame, we &s;hall one day join thee. Actuated by the re&s;pect we bore thee whil&s;t living, we now come to tender to thee the la&s;t act of kindne&s;s it is in our power to be&s;tow: that thy body might not lie neglected on the plain,
<PB N="205" REF="021728_0218_0FB53500207EAE08">
and become a prey to the bea&s;ts of the field, or the fowls of the air, we will take care to lay it with tho&s;e of thy predece&s;&s;ors who are gone before thee; hoping at the &s;ame time, that thy &s;pirit will feed with their &s;pirits, and be ready to receive ours, when we al&s;o &s;hall arrive at the great Country of Souls.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;hort &s;peeches &s;omewhat &s;imilar to this does every chief &s;peak the prai&s;es of his departed friend. When they have &s;o done, if they happen to be at a great di&s;|tance from the place of interment, appropriated to their tribe, and the per&s;on dies during the winter &s;ea&s;on, they wrap the body in &s;kins, and lay it on a high &s;tage built for this purpo&s;e, or on the branches of a large tree, till the &s;pring arrives. They then, after the manner de&s;cribed in my journal, carry it, together with all tho&s;e belong|ing to the &s;ame nation, to the general burial-place, where it is interred with &s;ome other ceremonies that I could not di&s;cover.</P>
<P>When the Naudowe&s;&s;ies brought their dead for inter|ment to the great cave, I attempted to get an in&s;ight into the remaining burial rites; but whether it was on account of the &s;tench which aro&s;e from &s;o many bodies, the weather being then hot, or whether they cho&s;e to keep this part of their cu&s;toms &s;ecret from me, I could not di&s;cover; I found, however, that they con&s;idered my curio&s;ity as ill-timed, and therefore I withdrew.</P>
<P>After the interment, the band to which the per&s;on belongs, take care to fix near the place &s;uch hierogly|phics as &s;hall &s;hew to future ages his merit and accom|pli&s;hments. If any of the&s;e people die in the &s;ummer, at a di&s;tance from the burying-ground, and they find it impo&s;&s;ible to remove the body before it putrefies, they burn the fle&s;h from the bones, and pre&s;erving the latter, bury them in the manner de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>As the Indians believe that the &s;ouls of the decea&s;ed employ them&s;elves in the &s;ame manner in the country of &s;pirits, as they did on earth, that they acquire their food by hunting, and have there, al&s;o, enemies to contend with, they take care that they do not enter tho&s;e regions defencele&s;s and unprovided: they con&s;equently bury with them their bows, their arrows, and all the other wea|pons
<PB N="206" REF="021728_0219_0FB535064E9CE7E0">
u&s;ed either in hunting or war. As they doubt not but they will likewi&s;e have occa&s;ion both for the nece&s;|&s;aries of life, and tho&s;e things they e&s;teem as ornaments, they u&s;ually depo&s;it in their tombs &s;uch &s;kins or &s;tuffs as they commonly made their garments of, dome&s;tic uten|&s;ils, and paint for ornamenting their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The near relations of the decea&s;ed lament his lo&s;s with an appearance of great &s;orrow and angui&s;h; they weep and howl, and make u&s;e of many contortions, as they fit in the hut or tent around the body, when the intervals between the prai&s;es of the chiefs will permit.</P>
<P>One formality in mourning for the dead among the Naudowe&s;&s;ies is very different from any mode I ob&s;erved in the other nations through which I pa&s;&s;ed. The men, to &s;hew how great their &s;orrow is, pierce the fle&s;h of their arms, above the elbows, with arrows; the &s;cars of which I could perceive on tho&s;e of every rank, in a greater or le&s;s degree; and the women cut and ga&s;h their legs with &s;harp broken flints, till the blood flows very plentifully.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I remained among them, a couple who&s;e tent was adjacent to mine, lo&s;t a &s;on of about four years of age. The parents were &s;o much affected at the death of their favorite child, that they pur&s;ued the u&s;ual te&s;ti|monies of grief with &s;uch uncommon rigor, as through the weight of &s;orrow and lo&s;s of blood, to occa&s;ion the death of the father. The woman, who had hitherto been incon&s;olable, no &s;ooner &s;aw her hu&s;band expire, that &s;he dried up her tears, and appeared cheerful and re&s;igned.</P>
<P>As I knew not how to account for &s;o extraordinary a tran&s;ition, I took an opportunity to a&s;k help the rea|&s;on of it; telling her at the &s;ame time, that I &s;hould have imagined the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band would rather have occa&s;ioned an increa&s;e of grief, than &s;uch a &s;udden di|minution of it.</P>
<P>She informed me, that as the child was &s;o young when it died, and unable to &s;upport it&s;elf in the country of &s;pirits, both &s;he and her hu&s;band had been apprehen&s;ive that its &s;ituation would be far from happy; but no &s;ooner did &s;he behold its father depart for the &s;ame place, who not
<PB N="207" REF="021728_0220_0FB5350717FB6780">
only loved the child with the tendere&s;t affection, but was a good hunter, and would be able to provide plen|tifully for its &s;upport, than &s;he cea&s;ed to mourn. She added, that &s;he now &s;aw no rea&s;on to continue her tears, as the child on whom &s;he doted, was happy under the care and protection of a fond father, and &s;he had only one wi&s;h that remained ungratified, which was that of being her&s;elf with them.</P>
<P>Expre&s;&s;ions &s;o replete with unaffected tenderne&s;s, and &s;entiments that would have done honor to a Roman ma|tron, made an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind greatly in favor of the people to whom &s;he belonged, and tended not a little to counteract the prejudices I had hitherto enter|tained, in common with every other traveller, of Indian in&s;en&s;ibility and want of parental tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Her &s;ub&s;equent conduct confirmed the favorable opi|nion I had ju&s;t imbibed; and convinced me, that, notwith|&s;tanding this apparent &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of her grief, &s;ome par|ticles of that reluctance, to be &s;eparated from a beloved re|lation, which is implanted either by nature or cu&s;tom in every human heart, &s;till lurked in hers. I ob&s;erved that he went almo&s;t every evening to the foot of the tree, on a branch of which the bodies of her hu&s;band and child were laid, and after cutting off a lock of her hair, and throwing it on the ground, in a plaintive, melan|choly &s;ong bemoaned its fate. A recapitulation of the actions he might have performed, had his life been &s;par|ed, appeared to be her favorite theme; and whil&s;t &s;he foretold the fame that would have attended an imitati|on of his father's virtues, her grief &s;eemed to be &s;u&s;|pended:&mdash;</P>
<P>"If thou had&s;t continued with us, my dear Son," would &s;he cry, <Q>how well would the bow have become thy hand, and how fatal would thy arrows have prov|ed to the enemies of our bands. Thou would&s;t of|ten have drank their blood, and eaten their fle&s;h, and numerous &s;laves would have rewarded thy toils. With a nervous arm would&s;t thou have &s;eized the wounded buffaloe, or have combated the fury of the enraged bear. Thou would&s;t have overtaken the flying elk, and have kept pace on the mountain's brow with the
<PB N="208" REF="021728_0221_0FB5350896B80658">
fleete&s;t deer. What feats mighte&s;t thou not have per|formed, had&s;t thou &s;taid among us till age had given thee &s;trength, and thy father had in&s;tructed thee in every Indian accompli&s;hment!</Q> In terms like the&s;e did this untutored &s;avage bewail the lo&s;s of her &s;on, and frequently would &s;he pa&s;s the greate&s;t part of the night in the affectionate employ.</P>
<P>The Indians in general are very &s;trict in the ob&s;erv|ance of their laws relative to mourning for their dead. In &s;ome nations they cut off their hair, blacken their faces, and &s;it in an erect po&s;ture, with their heads clo&s;e|ly covered, and depriving them&s;elves of every plea&s;ure. This &s;everity is continued for &s;everal months, and with &s;ome relaxations the appearance is &s;ometimes kept up for &s;everal years. I was told that when the Naudo|we&s;&s;ies recollected any incidents of the lives of their de|cea&s;ed relations, even after an interval of ten years, they would howl &s;o as to be heard at a great di&s;tance. They would &s;ometimes continue this proof of re&s;pect and af|fection for &s;everal hours; and if it happened that the thought occurred, and the noi&s;e was begun towards the evening, tho&s;e of their tribe, who are at hand would join with them.</P>

<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XVI. A conci&s;e Character of the Indians.</HEAD>
<P>THE character of the Indians, like that of other uncivilized nations, is compo&s;ed of a mixture of ferocity and gentlene&s;s. They are at once guided by pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, which they hold in common with the fierce&s;t bea&s;ts that inhabit their woods, and are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtues which do honor to human nature.</P>
<P>In the following e&s;timate I &s;hall endeavor to forget on the one hand the prejudices of Europeans, who u&s;ually annex to the word Indian, epithets that are di&s;graceful
<PB N="209" REF="021728_0222_0FB5350A173DB8E8">
to human nature, and who view them in no other light than as &s;avages and cannibals; whil&s;t with equal care I avoid any partiality towards them, as &s;ome mu&s;t natural|ly ari&s;e from the favorable reception I met with during my &s;tay among them.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I &s;hall confine my remarks to the nations inhabiting only the we&s;tern regions, &s;uch as the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, the Ottagaumies, the Chip&eacute;ways, the Winnebagoes, and the Saukies; for as throughout that diver&s;ity of climates, the exten&s;ive continent of Ameri|ca is compo&s;ed of, there are people of different di&s;po|&s;itions and various characters, it would be incompatible with my pre&s;ent undertaking to treat of all the&s;e, and to give a general view of them as a conjunctive body.</P>
<P>That the Indians are of a cruel, revengeful, inexora|ble di&s;po&s;ition, that they will watch whole days unmind|ful of the calls of nature, and make their way through pathle&s;s, and almo&s;t unbounded woods, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting only on the &s;canty produce of them, to pur&s;ue and revenge them&s;elves of an enemy; that they hear unmoved the piercing cries of &s;uch as unhappily fall into their hands, and receive a diabolical plea&s;ure from the tortures they in|flict on their pri&s;oners, I readily grant; but let us look on the rever&s;e of this terrifying picture, and we &s;hall find them temperate both in their diet and potations (it mu&s;t be remembered that I &s;peak of tho&s;e tribes who have little communication with Europeans) that they with|&s;tand, with unexampled patience, the attacks of hunger, or the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;ons, and e&s;teem the grati|fication of their appetites but as a &s;econdary con&s;ide|ration.</P>
<P>We &s;hall likewi&s;e &s;ee them &s;ocial and humane to tho&s;e whom they con&s;ider as their friends, and even to their adopted enemies; and ready to partake with them of the la&s;t mor&s;el, or to ri&s;k their lives in their defence.</P>
<P>In contradiction to the report of many other travel|lers, all of which have been tinctured with prejudice, I can a&s;&s;ert, that notwith&s;tanding the apparent indiffer|ence with which an Indian meets his wife and children after a long ab&s;ence, an indifference proceeding rather from cu&s;tom than in&s;en&s;ibility, he is not unmindful of
<PB N="210" REF="021728_0223_0FB5350EDEB06A30">
the claims either of connubial or parental tenderne&s;s; the little &s;tory I have introduced in the preceding chap|ter, of the Naudowe&s;&s;ie woman lamenting her child, and the immature death of the father, will elucidate this point, and enforce the a&s;&s;ertion much better than the mo&s;t &s;tudied arguments I can make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed from their youth to innumerable hard|&s;hips, they &s;oon become &s;uperior to a &s;en&s;e of danger, or the dread of death; and their fortitude, implanted by nature, and nurtured by example, by precept and ac|cident, never experiences a moment's allay.</P>
<P>Though &s;lothful and inactive whil&s;t their &s;tore of provi&s;ion remains unexhau&s;ted, and their foes are at a di&s;tance, they are indefatigable and per&s;evering in pur|&s;uit of their game, or in circumventing their enemies.</P>
<P>If they are artful and de&s;igning, and ready to take every advantage, if they are cool and deliberate in their councils, and cautious in the extreme either of di&s;cover|ing their &s;entiments, or of revealing a &s;ecret, they might at the &s;ame time boa&s;t of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing qualifications of a more animated nature, of the &s;acacity of a hound, the penetrating &s;ight of a lynx, the cunning of the fox, the agility of a bounding roe, and the unconquerable fierce|ne&s;s of the tiger.</P>
<P>In their public characters, as forming part of a com|munity, they po&s;&s;e&s;s an attachment for that band to which they belong, unknown to the inhabitants of any other country. They combine, as if they were actu|ated only by one &s;oul, again&s;t the enemies of their na|tion, and bani&s;h from their minds every con&s;ideration oppo&s;ed to this.</P>
<P>They con&s;ult without unnece&s;&s;ary oppo&s;ition, or with|out giving way to the excitements of envy or ambition, on the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to be pur&s;ued for the de&s;truc|tion of tho&s;e who have drawn on them&s;elves their di&s;|plea&s;ure. No &s;elfi&s;h views ever influence their advice, or ob&s;truct their con&s;ultations. Nor is it in the power of bribes or threats to dimini&s;h the love they bear their country.</P>
<P>The honor of their tribe, and the welfare of their na|tion, is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t predominant emotion of their
<PB N="211" REF="021728_0224_0FB535133A19C780">
hearts; and from hence proceed in a great mea&s;ure all their virtues and their vices. Actuated by this, they brave every danger, endure the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments, and expire triumphing in their fortitude, not as a per|&s;onal qualification, but as a national characteri&s;tic.</P>
<P>From the&s;e al&s;o flow that in&s;atiable revenge towards tho&s;e with whom they are at war, and all the con&s;equent horrors that di&s;grace their name. Their uncultivated mind being incapable of judging of the propriety of an action, in oppo&s;ition to their pa&s;&s;ions, which are totally in&s;en&s;ible to the controls of rea&s;on or humanity, they know not how to keep their fury within any bounds, and con&s;equently that courage and re&s;olution, which would otherwi&s;e do them honor, degenerates into a &s;a|vage ferocity.</P>
<P>But this &s;hort di&s;&s;ertation mu&s;t &s;uffice: the limits of my work will not permit me to treat the &s;ubject more copiou&s;ly, or to pur&s;ue it with a logical regularity. The ob&s;ervations already made by my readers on the preced|ing pages, will, I tru&s;t, render it unnece&s;&s;ary; as by them they will be enabled to form a tolerably ju&s;t idea of the people I have been de&s;cribing. Experience teach|es, that anecdotes, and relations of particular events, however trifling they might appear, enable us to form a truer judgment of the manners and cu&s;toms of a peo|ple, and are much more declaratory of their real &s;tate, than the mo&s;t &s;tudied and elaborate di&s;qui&s;ition, with|out the&s;e aids.</P>

<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XVII. Of their Language, Hieroglyphics, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE principal languages of the natives of North-America may be divided into four cla&s;&s;es, as they con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch as are made u&s;e of by the nations of the Iroquois towards the ea&s;tern parts of it, the Chip&eacute;ways
<PB N="212" REF="021728_0225_0FB5351812D555B8">
or Algonkins to the north-we&s;t, the Naudowe&s;&s;ies to the we&s;t, and the Cherokees, Chicka&s;aws, &amp;c. to the &s;outh. One or other of the&s;e four are u&s;ed by all the Indians who inhabit the parts that lie between the coa&s;t of La|bradore north, the Florida &s;outh, the Atlantic Ocean ea&s;t, and, as far as we can judge from the di&s;coveries hitherto made, the Pacific Ocean on the we&s;t.</P>
<P>But of all the&s;e, the Chip&eacute;way tongue appears to be the mo&s;t prevailing; it being held in &s;uch e&s;teem, that the chiefs of every tribe, dwelling about the great lakes, or to the we&s;tward of the&s;e on the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ip|pi, with tho&s;e as far &s;outh as the Ohio, and as far north as Hud&s;on's Bay, con&s;i&s;ting of more than thirty dif|ferent tribes, &s;peak this language alone in their coun|cils, notwith&s;tanding each has a peculiar one of their own.</P>
<P>It will probably in time become univer&s;al among all the Indian nations, as none of them attempt to make ex|cur&s;ions to any great di&s;tance, or are con&s;idered as quali|fied to carry on any negotiation with a di&s;tant band, unle&s;s they have acquired the Chip&eacute;way tongue.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, be&s;ides the Chip&eacute;ways, to whom it is na|tural, the Ottawaws, the Saukies, the Ottagaumies, the Killi&s;tinoes, the Nipegons, the bands about Lake Le Pleuve, and the remains of the Algonkins, or Gens de Terre, all conver&s;e in it, with &s;ome little variation of dialect; but whether it be natural to tho&s;e nations, or acquired, I was not able to di&s;cover. I am however of opinion that the barbarous and uncouth dialect of the Winnebagoes, the Menomonies, and many other tribes, will become in time totally extinct, and this be adopted in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>The Chip&eacute;way tongue is not encumbered with any unnece&s;&s;ary tones or accents, neither are there any words in it that are &s;uperfluous; it is al&s;o ea&s;y to pro|nounce, and much more copious than any other Indian language.</P>
<P>As the Indians are unacquainted with the polite arts, or with the &s;ciences, and as they are al&s;o &s;trangers to ceremony, or compliment, they neither have nor need an infinity of words where with to embelli&s;h their di&s;|cour&s;e.
<PB N="213" REF="021728_0226_0FB5351A95A9D660">
Plain and unpoli&s;hed in their manners, they only make u&s;e of &s;uch as &s;erve to denominate the nece&s;|&s;aries or conveniences of life, and to expre&s;s their wants, which in a &s;tate of nature can be but few.</P>
<P>I have annexed hereto a &s;hort vocabulary of the Chip&eacute;way language, and another of that of the Naudo|we&s;&s;ies, but am not able to reduce them to the rules of grammar.</P>
<P>The latter is &s;poken in a &s;oft accent, without any guttural &s;ounds, &s;o that it may be learnt with facility, and is not difficult either to be pronounced or written. It is nearly as copious and expre&s;&s;ive as the Chip&eacute;way tongue, and is the mo&s;t prevailing language of any on the we&s;tern banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; being in u&s;e, ac|cording to their account, among all the nations that lie to the north of the Me&s;&s;orie, and extend as far we&s;t as the &s;hores of the Pacific Ocean.</P>
<P>As the Indians are not acquainted with letters, it is very difficult to convey with preci&s;ion the exact &s;ound of their words; I have however endeavored to write them as near to the manner in which they expre&s;&s;ed, as &s;uch an uncertain mode will admit of.</P>
<P>Although the Indians cannot communicate their ideas by writing, yet they form certain hieroglyphics, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;erve to perpetuate any extraordinary tran&s;action, or uncommon event. Thus when they are on their excur&s;ions, and either intend to proceed, or have been on any remarkable enterpri&s;e, they peel the bark from the trees which lie in their way, to give intelligence to tho&s;e parties that happen to be at a di&s;tance, of the path they mu&s;t pur&s;ue to overtake them.</P>
<P>The following in&s;tance will convey a more perfect idea of the methods they make u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion, than any expre&s;&s;ions I can frame.</P>
<P>When I left the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and proceeded up the Chip&eacute;way River, in my way to Lake Superior, as relat|ed in my Journal, my guide, who was a chief of the Chip&eacute;ways that dwell on the Ottawaw Lake, near the heads of the river we had ju&s;t entered, fearing that &s;ome partirs of the Naudowe&s;&s;ies, with whom his nation are
<PB N="214" REF="021728_0227_0FB5351C17FB9278">
perpetually at war, might accidentally fall in with us, and before they were appri&s;ed of my being in company, do us &s;ome mi&s;chief, he took the following &s;teps:</P>
<P>He peeled the bark from a large tree, near the en|trance of a river, and with wood-coal, mixed with bear's grea&s;e, their u&s;ual &s;ub&s;titute for ink, made in an un|couth, but expre&s;&s;ive manner, the figure of the town of the Ottagaumies. He then formed to the left a man dre&s;&s;ed in &s;kins, by which he intended to repre&s;ent a Naudowe&s;&s;ie, with a line drawn from his mouth to that of a deer, the &s;ymbol of the Chip&eacute;ways. After this he depictured &s;till further to the left a canoe as proceed|ing up the river, in which he placed a man &s;itting with a hat on; this figure was de&s;igned to repre&s;ent an Engli&s;hman, or my&s;elf, and my Frenchman was drawn with a handkerchief tied round his head, and rowing the canoe; to the&s;e he added &s;everal other &s;ignificant emblems, among which the Pipe of Peace appeared painted on the prow of the canoe.</P>
<P>The meaning he intended to convey to the Naudo|we&s;&s;ies, and which I doubt not appeared perfectly intel|ligible to them, was, that one of the Chip&eacute;way chiefs had received a &s;peech from &s;ome Naudowe&s;&s;ie chiefs, at the town of the Ottagaumies, de&s;iring him to con|duct the Engli&s;hman, who had lately been among them, up the Chip&eacute;way river; and that they thereby required, that the Chip&eacute;way, notwith&s;tanding he was an avowed enemy, &s;hould not be mole&s;ted by them on his pa&s;&s;age, as he had the care of a per&s;on whom they e&s;teemed as one of their nation.</P>
<P>Some authors have pretended that the Indians have armorial bearings, which they blazon with great exact|ne&s;s, and which di&s;tingui&s;h one nation from another; but I never could ob&s;erve any other arms among them than the &s;ymbols already de&s;cribed.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE BEASTS.</HEAD>
<P>The Tiger, the Bear, Wolves, Foxes, Dogs, the Cat of the Mountain, the Wild Cat, the Buffalo, the Deer,
<PB N="229" REF="021728_0242_0FB5355092244598">
the Elk, the Moo&s;e, the Carraboo, the Carcajou, the Skunk, the Porcupine, the Hedge-hog, the Wood-chuck, the Racoon, the Marten, the Fi&s;her, the Mu&s;k|qua&s;h, Squirrels, Hares, Rabbits, the Mole, the Wea|&s;el, the Mou&s;e, the Dormou&s;e, the Beaver, the Otter, the Mink, and Bats.</P>
<P>The TIGER. The Tiger of America re&s;embles in &s;hape tho&s;e of Africa and A&s;ia, but is con&s;iderably &s;maller. Nor does it appear to be &s;o fierce and ravenous as they are. The color of it is a darki&s;h fallow, and it is entirely free from &s;pots. I &s;aw one on an i&s;land in the Chip&eacute;way River, of which I had a very good view, as it was at no great di&s;tance from me. It &s;at up on its hinder parts like a dog; and did not &s;eem either to be apprehen&s;ive of our approach, or to di&s;cover any ra|venous inclinations. It is however very &s;eldom to be met with, in this part of the world.</P>
<P>The BEAR. Bears are very numerous on this con|tinent, but more particularly &s;o in the northern parts of it, and contribute to furni&s;h both food and beds for al|mo&s;t every Indian nation. Tho&s;e of America differ in many re&s;pects from tho&s;e either of Greenland or Ru&s;&s;ia, they being not only &s;omewhat &s;maller, but timorous and inoffen&s;ive, unle&s;s they are pinched by hunger, or &s;marting from a wound. The &s;ight of a man terrifies them; and a dog will put &s;everal to flight. They are extremely fond of grapes, and will climb to the top of the highe&s;t trees in que&s;t of them. This kind of food renders their fle&s;h exce&s;&s;ively rich, and finely flavored; and it is con&s;equently preferred by the Indians and tra|ders to that of any other animal. The fat is very white, and be&s;ides being &s;weet and whole&s;ome, is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of one valuable quality, which is, that it never cloys. The inhabitants of the&s;e parts con&s;tantly anoint them&s;elves with it, and to its efficacy they in a great mea&s;ure owe their agility. The &s;ea&s;on for hunting the bear is during the winter; when they take up their abode in hollow trees, or make them&s;elves dens in the roots of tho&s;e that are blown down, the entrance of which they &s;top up with branches of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir that lie &s;cattered about. From the&s;e retreats it is &s;aid they &s;tir not whil&s;t
<PB N="230" REF="021728_0243_0FB5355399901528">
the weather continues &s;evere, and as it is well known that they do not provide them&s;elves with food, they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be enabled by nature to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for &s;ome months without, and during this time to continue of the &s;ame bulk.</P>
<P>The WOLF. The wolves of North-America are much le&s;s than tho&s;e which are met with in other parts of the world. They have, however, in common with the re&s;t of their &s;pecies, a wildne&s;s in their looks, and a fiercene&s;s in their eyes; notwith&s;tanding which, they are far from being &s;o ravenous as the European wolves, nor will they ever attack a man, except they have ac|cidentally fed on the fle&s;h of tho&s;e &s;lain in battle. When they herd together, as they often do in the winter, they make a hideous and terrible noi&s;e. In the&s;e parts there are two kinds; one of which is of a fallow co|lor, the other of a dun, inclining to a black.</P>
<P>The FOX. There are two &s;orts of foxes in North-America, which differ only in their color, one being of a reddi&s;h brown, the other of a grey; tho&s;e of the latter kind that are found near the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, are extremely beautiful, their hair being of a fine &s;ilver grey.</P>
<P>DOGS. The dogs employed by the Indians in hunting appear to be all of the &s;ame &s;pecies; they car|ry their ears erect, and greatly re&s;emble a wolf about the head. They are exceedingly u&s;eful to them, in their hunting excur&s;ions, and will attack the fierce&s;t of the game they are in pur&s;uit of. They are al&s;o remarkable for their fidelity to their ma&s;ters; but being ill fed by them, are very trouble&s;ome in their huts or tents.</P>
<P>The CAT of the Mountain. This creature is in &s;hape like a cat, only much larger. The hair or fur re|&s;embles al&s;o the &s;kin of that dome&s;tic animal; the color however differs, for the former is of a reddi&s;h or orange ca&s;t, but grows lighter near the belly. The whole &s;kin is beautified with black &s;pots of different figures, of which tho&s;e on the back are long, and tho&s;e on the lower parts round. On the ears there are black &s;tripes. This creature is nearly as fierce as a leopard, but will &s;eldom attack a man.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="021728_0244_0FB53555163C5A30">The BUFFALO. This bea&s;t, of which there are amazing numbers in the&s;e parts, is larger than an ox, has &s;hort black horns, with a large beard under his chin, and his head is &s;o full of hair, that it falls over his eyes, and gives him a frightful look. There is a bunch on his back which begins at the haunches, and increa&s;ing gradually to the &s;houlders, reaches on to the neck. Both this excre&s;cence and its whole body are co|vered with long hair, or rather wool, of a dun or mou&s;e color, which is exceedingly valuable, e&s;pecially that on the fore part of the body. Its head is larger than a bull's, with a very &s;hort neck; the brea&s;t is broad, and the body decrea&s;es towards the buttocks. The&s;e crea|tures will run away at the &s;ight of a man, and a whole herd will make off when they perceive a &s;ingle dog. The fle&s;h of the buffalo is excellent food, its hide ex|tremely u&s;eful, and the hair very proper for the manu|facture of various articles.</P>
<P>The DEER. There is but one &s;pecies of deer in North-America, and the&s;e are higher and of a &s;limmer make than tho&s;e in Europe. Their &s;hape is nearly the &s;ame as the European, their color of a deep f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llow, and their horns very large and branching. This bea&s;t is the &s;wifte&s;t on the American plains, and they herd together as they do in other countries.</P>
<P>The ELK greatly exceeds the deer in &s;ize, being in bulk equal to a hor&s;e. Its body is &s;haped like that of a deer, only its tail is remarkably &s;hort, being not more than three inches long. The color of its hair, which is grey, and not unlike that of a camel, but of a more reddi&s;h ca&s;t, is nearly three inches in length, and as coar&s;e as that of a hor&s;e. The horns of this creature grow to a prodigious &s;ize, extending &s;o wide that two or three per&s;ons might &s;it between them at the &s;ame time. They are not forked like tho&s;e of a deer, but have all their teeth or branches on the outer edge. Nor does the form of tho&s;e of the elk re&s;emble a deer's, the former being flat, and eight or ten inches broad, where|as the latter are round and con&s;iderably narrower. They &s;hed their horns every year in the month of Fe|bruary, and by Augu&s;t the new ones are nearly arrived
<PB N="232" REF="021728_0245_0FB53556A5E13848">
at their full growth. Notwith&s;tanding their &s;ize, and the means of defence nature has furni&s;hed them with, they are as timorous as a deer, Their &s;kin is very u&s;eful, and will dre&s;s as well as that of a buck. They feed on gra&s;s in the &s;ummer, and on mo&s;s or buds in the win|ter.</P>
<P>The MOOSE is nearly about the &s;ize of the elk, and the horns of it are almo&s;t as enormous as that ani|mal's; the &s;tem of them, however, is not quite &s;o wide, and they branch on both &s;ides like tho&s;e of a deer. This creature al&s;o &s;heds them every year. Though its hinder parts are very broad, its tail is not above an &s;uch long. It has feet and legs like a camel; its head is about two feet long, its upper lip much larger than the under, and the no&s;trils of it are &s;o wide that a man might thru&s;t his hand into them a con&s;iderable way. The hair of the moo&s;e is light grey, mixed with a black|i&s;h red. It is very ela&s;tic, for though it be beaten ever &s;o long, it will retain its original &s;hape. The fle&s;h is exceeding good food, ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and very nou|ri&s;hing. The no&s;e, or upper lip, which is large and loo&s;e from the gums, is e&s;teemed a great delicacy, being of a firm con&s;i&s;tence, between marrow and gri&s;tle, and when properly dre&s;&s;ed, affords a rich and lu&s;cious di&s;h. Its hide is very proper for leather, being thick and &s;trong, yet &s;oft and pliable. The pace of this creature is always a trot, which is &s;o expeditious, that it is exceeded in &s;wiftne&s;s but by few of its fellow inhabitants of the&s;e woods. It is generally found in the fore&s;ts, where it feeds on mo&s;s and buds. Though this creature is of the deer kind, it never herds as tho&s;e do. Mo&s;t authors confound it with the elk, deer, or carraboo, but it is a &s;pecies totally different, as might be di&s;covered by at|tending to the de&s;cription I have given of each.</P>
<P>The CARRABOO. This bea&s;t is not near &s;o tall as the moo&s;e, however it is &s;omething like it in &s;hape, only rather more heavy, and inclining to the form of the a&s;s. The horns of it are not flat as tho&s;e of the elk are, but round like tho&s;e of the deer; they al&s;o meet nearer together at the extremities, and bend more over the face than either tho&s;e of the elk or moo&s;e.
<PB N="233" REF="021728_0246_0FB535610168AFF0">
It partakes of the &s;wiftne&s;s of the deer, and is with difficulty overtaken by its pur&s;uers. The fle&s;h of it like|wi&s;e is equally as good, the tongue particularly is in high e&s;teem. The &s;kin being &s;mooth and free from veins, is as valuable as &s;hamoy.</P>
<P>The CARCAJOU. This creature, which is of the cat kind, is a terrible enemy to the preceding four &s;pecies of bea&s;ts. He either comes upon them from &s;ome concealment unperceived, or climbs up into a tree, and taking his &s;tation on &s;ome of the branches, waits till one of them, driven by an extreme of heat or cold, takes &s;helter under it; when he fa&s;tens upon his neck, and opening the jugular vein, &s;oon brings his prey to the ground. This he is enabled to do by his long tail, with which he encircles the body of his adver&s;ary; and the only means they have to &s;hun their fate, is by fly|ing immediately to the water; by this method, as the carcajou has a great di&s;like to that element, he is &s;ome|times got rid of before he can effect his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The SKUNK. This is the mo&s;t extraordinary animal that the American woods produce. It is rather le&s;s than a pole-cat, and of the &s;ame &s;pecies; it is there|fore often mi&s;taken for that creature, but it is very dif|ferent from it in many points. Its hair is long and &s;hin|ing, variegated with large black and white &s;pots, the former mo&s;tly on the &s;houlders and rump; its tail is very bu&s;hy, like that of the fox, part black, and part white like its body; it lives chiefly in the woods and hedges; but its extraordinary powers are only &s;hewn when it is pur&s;ued. As &s;oon as he finds him&s;elf in dan|ger, he ejects, to a great di&s;tance from behind, a &s;mall &s;tream of water, of &s;o &s;ubtile a nature, and at the &s;ame time of &s;o powerful a &s;mell, that the air is tainted with it for half a mile in circumference; and his pur&s;u|ers, whether men or dogs, being almo&s;t &s;uffocated with the &s;tench, are obliged to give over the pur&s;uit. On this account he is called by the French, Enfant du Di|able, the Child of the Devil; or Bete Puante, the Stink|ing Bea&s;t. It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the noi|&s;ome effects of the liquid with which this creature is &s;upplied by nature for its defence. If a drop of it falls
<PB N="234" REF="021728_0247_0FB53569EF2FDD50">
on your clothes, they are rendered &s;o di&s;agreeable that it is impo&s;&s;ible ever after to wear them; or if any of it enters your eyelids, the pain becomes intolerable for a long time, and perhaps at la&s;t you lo&s;e your &s;ight. The &s;mell of the &s;kunk, though thus to be dreaded, is not like that of a putrid carca&s;e, but a &s;trong foetid effluvia of mu&s;k, which di&s;plea&s;es rather from its penetrating power than from its nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s. It is notwith&s;tanding con&s;idered as conducive to clear the head, and to rai&s;e the &s;pirits. This water is &s;uppo&s;ed by naturali&s;ts to be its urine; but I have di&s;&s;ected many of them that I have &s;hot, and have found within their bodies, near the urinal ve&s;&s;el, a &s;mall receptacle of water, totally di&s;tinct from the bladder which contained the urine, and from which alone I am &s;atisfied the horrid &s;tench proceeds. After having taken out with great care the bag wherein this water is lodged, I have frequently fed on them, and have found them very &s;weet and good; but one drop emitted, taints not only the carca&s;e, but the whole hou&s;e, and renders every kind of provi&s;ions, that are in it, unfit for u&s;e. With great ju&s;tice therefore do the French give it &s;uch a diabolical name.</P>
<P>The PORCUPINE. The body of an American porcupine is in bulk about the &s;ize of a &s;mall dog, but it is both &s;horter in length, and not &s;o high from the ground. It varies very much from tho&s;e of other coun|tries both in its &s;hape and the length of its quills. The former is like that of a fox, except the head, which is not &s;o &s;harp and long, but re&s;embles more that of a rab|bit. Its body is covered with hair of a dark brown, about four inches long, great part of which are the thick|ne&s;s of a &s;traw, and are termed its quills. The&s;e are white, with black points, hollow and very &s;trong, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e that grow on the back. The quills &s;erve this creature for offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive weapons, which he darts at his enemies, and if they pierce the fle&s;h in the lea&s;t degree, they will &s;ink quite into it, and are not to be extracted without inci&s;ion. The Indians u&s;e them for boring their ears and no&s;es, to in&s;ert their pendants, and al&s;o by way of ornament to their &s;tockings, hair, &amp;c. be&s;ides which they greatly e&s;teem the fle&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="021728_0248_0FB5356AD81511D0">The WOOD-CHUCK is a ground animal of the fur kind, about the &s;ize of a marten, being nearly fifteen inches long; its body however is rounder, and his legs &s;horter; the fore-paws of it are broad, and con&s;tructed for the purpo&s;e of digging holes in the ground, where it burrows like a rabbit; its fur is of a grey color, on the reddi&s;h ca&s;t, and its fle&s;h tolerable food.</P>
<P>The RACOON is &s;omewhat le&s;s in &s;ize than a beaver, and its feet and legs are like tho&s;e of that creature, but &s;hort in proportion to its body, which re|&s;embles that of a badger. The &s;hape of its head is much like a fox's, only the ears are &s;horter, more round and naked; and its hair is al&s;o &s;imilar to that animal's, being thick, long, &s;oft, and black at the ends. On its face there is a broad &s;tripe that runs acro&s;s it, and in|cludes the eyes, which are large. Its muzzle is black, and at the end roundi&s;h like that of a dog; the teeth are al&s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e of a dog in number and &s;hape; the tail is long and round, with annular &s;tripes on it like tho&s;e of a cat; the feet have five long &s;lender toes, arm|ed with &s;harp claws, by which it is enabled to climb up trees like a monkey, and to run to the very extremities of the boughs. It makes u&s;e of its fore-feet, in the manner of hands, and feeds it&s;elf with them. The fle&s;h of this creature is very good in the months of Septem|ber and October, when fruit and nuts, on which it likes to feed, are plenty.</P>
<P>The MARTEN is rather larger than a &s;quirrel, and &s;omewhat of the &s;ame make; its legs and claws, however, are con&s;iderably &s;horter. Its ears are &s;hort, broad, and roundi&s;h, and its eyes &s;hine in the night like tho&s;e of a cat. The whole body is covered with fur of a browni&s;h fallow color, and there are &s;ome in the more northern parts which are black; the &s;kins of the latter are of much greater value than the others. The tail is covered with long hair, which makes it appear thicker than it really is. Its fle&s;h is &s;ometimes eaten, but is not in any great e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The MUSQUASH, or MUSK-RAT, is &s;o termed for the exqui&s;ite mu&s;k which it affords. It ap|pears to be a diminutive of the beaver, being endowed
<PB N="236" REF="021728_0249_0FB5356E9B1ED730">
with all the properties of that &s;agacious animal, and wants nothing but &s;ize and &s;trength, being not much bigger than a large rat of the Norway breed, to rival the creature it &s;o much re&s;embles. Was it not for its tail, which is exactly the &s;ame as that of an European rat, the &s;tructure of their bodies is &s;o much alike, e&s;pe|cially the head, that it might be taken for a &s;mall bea|ver. Like that creature it builds it&s;elf a cabin, but of a le&s;s perfect con&s;truction, and takes up its abode near the &s;ide of &s;ome piece of water. In the &s;pring they leave their retreats, and in pairs &s;ub&s;i&s;t on leaves and roots till the &s;ummer comes on, when they feed on &s;traw|berries, ra&s;berries, and &s;uch other fruits as they can reach. At the approach of winter they &s;eparate, when each takes up its lodging apart by it&s;elf in &s;ome hollow of a tree, where they remain quite unprovided with food, and there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, &s;ub&s;i&s;t without any till the return of &s;pring.</P>
<P>SQUIRRELS. There are five &s;orts of &s;quir|rels in America; the red, the grey, the black, the va|riegated, and the flying. The two former are exactly the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Europe; the black are &s;omewhat larger, and differ from them only in color; the varie|gated al&s;o re&s;emble them in &s;hape and figure, but are very beautiful, being finely &s;triped with white or grey, and &s;ometimes with red and black. The American fly|ing &s;quirrel is much le&s;s than the European, being not above five inches long, and of a ru&s;&s;et grey or a&s;h-color on the back, and white on the under parts. It has black prominent eyes, like tho&s;e of the mou&s;e, with a long, flat, broad tail. By a membrane on each &s;ide, which reaches from its fore to its hind legs, this crea|ture is enabled to leap from one tree to another, even if they &s;tand a con&s;iderable di&s;tance apart; this loo&s;e &s;kin, which it is enabled to &s;tretch out like a &s;ail, and by which it is buoyed up, is about two inches broad, and is covered with a fine hair or down. It feeds upon the &s;ame provi&s;ions as the others, and is ea&s;ily tamed.</P>
<P>The BEAVER. This creature has been &s;o often treated of, and his uncommon abilities &s;o minutely de|&s;cribed, that any further account of it will appear un|nece&s;&s;ary;

however for the benefit of tho&s;e of my readers who are not &s;o well acquainted with the form and pro|perties of this &s;agacious and u&s;eful animal, I &s;hall give a conci&s;e de&s;cription of it. The beaver is an amphibious quadruped, which cannot live for any long time in the water, and it is &s;aid is even able to exi&s;t entirely without it, provided it has the convenience of &s;ometimes bathing it&s;elf. The large&s;t beavers are nearly four feet in length, and about fourteen or fifteen inches in breadth over the haunches; they weigh about &s;ixty pounds. Its head is like that of the otter, but larger; its &s;nout is pretty long, the eyes &s;mall, the ears &s;hort, round, hairy on the out&s;ide, and &s;mooth within, and its teeth very long; the under teeth &s;tand out of their mouths about the breadth of three fingers, and the upper half a fin|ger, all of which are broad, crooked, &s;trong, and &s;harp; be&s;ides tho&s;e teeth called the inci&s;ors, which grow double, are &s;et very deep in their jaws, and bend like the edge of an axe, they have &s;ixteen grinders, eight on each &s;ide, four above and four below, directly oppo&s;ite to each other. With the former they are able to cut down trees of a con&s;iderable &s;ize, with the latter to break the harde&s;t &s;ub&s;tances. Its legs are &s;hort, particularly the fore-legs, which are only four or five inches long, and not unlike tho&s;e of a badger; the toes of the fore-feet are &s;eparate, the nails placed obliquely, and are hollow like quills; but the hind feet are quite different, and furni&s;hed with membranes between the toes. By this means it can walk though but &s;lowly, and is able to &s;wim with as much ea&s;e as any other aquatic animal. The tail has &s;omewhat in it that re&s;embles a fi&s;h, and &s;eems to have no manner of relation to the re&s;t of the body, except the hind feet, all the other parts being &s;imilar to tho&s;e of land animals. The tail is covered with a &s;kin furni&s;h|ed with &s;cales, that are joined together by a pellicle; the&s;e &s;cales are about the thickne&s;s of parchment, nearly a line and a half in length, and generally of a hexagoni|cal figure, having &s;ix corners; it is about eleven or twelve inches in length, and broader in the middle, where it is four inches over, than either at the root or the extremi|ty. It is about two inches thick near the body, where
<PB N="238" REF="021728_0251_0FB535791C5FC370">
it is almo&s;t round, and grows gradually thinner and flatter to the end. The color of the beaver is different according to the different climates in which it is found. In the mo&s;t northern parts they are generally quite black; in more temperate, brown; their color becoming lighter and lighter as they approach towards the &s;outh. The fur is of two &s;orts all over the body, except at the feet, where it is very &s;hort; that which is the longe&s;t is generally in length about an inch, but on the back it &s;ometimes extends to two inches, gradually dimini&s;hing towards the head and tail. This part of the fur is har&s;h, coar&s;e, and &s;hining, and of lit|tle u&s;e; the other part con&s;i&s;ts of a very thick and fine down, &s;o &s;oft that it feels almo&s;t like &s;ilk, about three quarters of an inch in length, and is what is commonly manufactured. Ca&s;tor, which is u&s;eful in medicine, is produced from the body of this creature; it was former|ly believed to be its te&s;ticles, but later di&s;coveries have &s;hown that it is contained in four bags, &s;ituated in the lower belly. Two of which, that are called the &s;uperior, from their being more elevated than the others, are filled with a &s;oft re&s;inous, adhe&s;ive matter, mixed with &s;mall fibres, greyi&s;h without, and yellow within, of a &s;trong, di&s;agreeable, and penetrating &s;cent, and very inflammable. This is the true ca&s;toreum; it hardens in the air, and becomes brown, brittle, and friable. The inferior bags contain an unctuous liquor like honey; the color of which is a pale yellow, and its odor &s;omewhat different from the other, being rather weaker and more di&s;agreeable; it however thickens as it grows older, and at length becomes about the con&s;i&s;tence of tallow. This has al&s;o its particular u&s;e in medicine; but it is not &s;o valuable as the true ca&s;toreum.</P>
<P>The ingenuity of the&s;e creatures in building their cabins, and in providing for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is truly wonderful. When they are about to choo&s;e them&s;elves a habitation, they a&s;&s;emble in companies &s;ometimes of two or three hundred, and after mature deliberation fix on a place where plenty of provi&s;ions, and all nece&s;&s;aries are to be found. Their hou&s;es are always &s;ituated in the water, and when they can find neither lake nor pond adjacent, they endeavor to &s;upply the defect by &s;top|ping
<PB N="239" REF="021728_0252_0FB5357A98A32100">
the current of &s;ome brook or &s;mall river, by means of a cau&s;eway or dam. For this purpo&s;e they &s;et about felling of trees, and they take care to choo&s;e out tho&s;e that grow above the place where they intend to build, that they may &s;wim down with the current. Having fixed on tho&s;e that are proper, three or four beavers placing them&s;elves round a large one, find means with their &s;trong teeth to bring it down. They al&s;o prudent|ly contrive that it &s;hall fall towards the water, that they may have the le&s;s way to carry it. After they have by a continuance of the &s;ame labor and indu&s;try, cut it in|to proper lengths, they roll the&s;e into the water, and navigate them towards the place where they are to be employed. Without entering more minutely into the mea&s;ures they pur&s;ue in the con&s;truction of their dams, I &s;hall only remark, that having prepared a kind of mortar with their feet, and laid it on with their tails, which they had before made u&s;e of to tran&s;port it to the place where it is requi&s;ite, they con&s;truct them with as much &s;olidity and regularity as the mo&s;t experienced workman could do. The formation of their cabins is no le&s;s amazing. The&s;e are either built on piles in the middle of the &s;mall lakes they have thus formed, on the bank of a river, or at the extremity of &s;ome point of land that advances into a lake. The figure of them is round or oval, and they are fa&s;hioned with an ingenuity equal to their dams. Two thirds of the edifice &s;tands above the water, and this part is &s;ufficiently capacious to contain eight or ten inhabitants. Each beaver has his place a&s;&s;igned him, the floor of which he curiou&s;ly &s;trews with leaves, or &s;mall branches of the pine-tree, &s;o as to render it clean and comfortable; and their ca|bins are all &s;ituated &s;o contiguous to each other, as to allow of an ea&s;y communication. The winter never &s;urpri&s;es the&s;e animals before their bu&s;ine&s;s is completed; for by the latter end of September their hou&s;es are fini&s;h|ed, and their &s;tock of provi&s;ions are generally laid in. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t of &s;mall pieces of wood who&s;e texture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;oft, &s;uch as the poplar, the a&s;pin, or willow, &amp;c. which they lay up in piles, and di&s;po&s;e of in &s;uch manner as to pre&s;erve their moi&s;ture.

in&s;tance of &s;agacity that is to be di&s;covered in the&s;e ani|mals, they would fill a volume, and prove not only en|tertaining but in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>The OTTER. This creature al&s;o is amphibious, and greatly re&s;embles a beaver, but is very different from it in many re&s;pects. Its body is nearly as long as a beaver's, but con&s;iderably le&s;s in all its parts. The muzzle, eyes, and the form of the head are nearly the &s;ame, but the teeth are very unlike, for the otter wants the large in|ci&s;ors or nippers that a beaver has; in&s;tead of the&s;e, all his teeth, without any di&s;tinction, are &s;haped like tho&s;e of a dog or wolf. The hair al&s;o of the former is not half &s;o long as that belonging to the latter, nor is the color of it exactly the &s;ame, for the hair of an otter under the neck, &s;tomach, and belly, is more greyi&s;h than that of a beaver, and in many other re&s;pects it likewi&s;e varies. This animal, which is met with in mo&s;t parts of the world, but in much greater num|bers in North-America, is very mi&s;chievous, and when he is clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, will not only attack dogs but men.</P>
<P>It generally feeds upon fi&s;h, e&s;pecially in the &s;ummer, but in the winter is contented with the bark of trees, or the produce of the fields. Its fle&s;h both ta&s;tes and &s;mells of fi&s;h, and is not whole&s;ome food, though it is &s;ome|times eaten through nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>The MINK is of the otter kind, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ame manner. In &s;hape and &s;ize it re&s;embles a pole-cat, being equally long and &s;lender. Its &s;kin is blacker than that of an otter, or almo&s;t any other creature; <Q>as black as a mink,</Q> being a proverbial expre&s;&s;ion in America; it is not however &s;o valuable, though this great|ly depends on the &s;ea&s;on in which it is taken. Its tail is round like that of a &s;nake, but growing flatti&s;h to|wards the end, and is entirely without hair. An agree|able mu&s;ky &s;cent exhales from its body; and it is met with near the &s;ources of rivers, on who&s;e banks it chiefly lives.</P>

<P>The EAGLE. There are only two &s;orts of eagles in the&s;e parts, the bald and the grey, which are much the &s;ame in &s;ize, and &s;imilar to the &s;hape of tho&s;e of other countries.</P>
<P>The NIGHT HAWK. This bird is of the hawk &s;pecies, its bill being crooked, its wings formed for &s;wiftne&s;s, and its &s;hape nearly like that of the com|mon hawk; but in &s;ize it is con&s;iderably le&s;s, and in color rather darker. It is &s;carcely ever &s;een but in the evening, when, at the approach of twilight, it flies about, and darts it&s;elf in wanton gambols at the head of the belated traveller. Before a thunder-&s;hower the&s;e birds are &s;een at an amazing height in the air a&s;&s;embled to|gether in great numbers, as &s;wallows are ob&s;erved to do on the &s;ame occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The WHIPPERWILL, or, as it is termed by the Indians, the Muckawi&s;s. This extraordinary bird is &s;omewhat like the la&s;t-mentioned in its &s;hape and color, only it has &s;ome whiti&s;h &s;tripes acro&s;s the wings, and like that is &s;eldom ever &s;een till after &s;un-&s;et. It al&s;o is never met with but during the &s;pring and &s;ummer months. As &s;oon as the Indians are informed by its notes of its return, they conclude that the fro&s;t is entirely gone, in which they are &s;eldom deceived; and on receiving this a&s;&s;urance of milder weather, begin to &s;ow their corn.
<PB N="242" REF="021728_0255_0FB5358B16672738">
It acquires its name by the noi&s;e it makes, which to the people of the colonies &s;ounds like the name they give it, Whipper-will; to an Indian ear Muck-a-wi&s;s. The words, it is true, are not alike, but in this manner they &s;trike the imagination of each; and the circum|&s;tance is a proof that the &s;ame &s;ounds, if they are not rendered certain by being reduced to the rules of ortho|graphy, might convey different ideas to different peo|ple. As &s;oon as night comes on, the&s;e birds will place them&s;elves on the fences, &s;tumps, or &s;tones that lie near &s;ome hou&s;e, and repeat their melancholy notes without any variation till midnight. The Indians, and &s;ome of the inhabitants of the back &s;ettlements, think if this bird perches upon any hou&s;e, that it betokens &s;ome mi&s;|hap to the inhabitants of it.</P>
<P>The FISH HAWK greatly re&s;embles the lat|ter in its &s;hape, and receives his name from his food, which is generally fi&s;h; it &s;kims over the lakes and rivers, and &s;ometimes &s;eems to lie expanded on the water, as he hovers &s;o clo&s;e to it, and having by &s;ome attractive power drawn the fi&s;h within its reach, darts &s;uddenly upon them. The charm it makes u&s;e of is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an oil contained in a &s;mall bag in the body, and which nature has by &s;ome means or other &s;upplied him with the power of u&s;ing for this purpo&s;e; it is how|ever very certain that any bait touched with a drop of the oil collected from this bird is an irre&s;i&s;tible lure for all &s;orts of fi&s;h, and in&s;ures the angler great &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>The OWL. The only &s;ort of owls that is found on the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi is extremely beautiful in its plumage, being of a fine deep yellow or gold color, plea&s;ingly &s;haded and &s;potted.</P>
<P>The CRANE. There is a kind of crane in the&s;e parts, which is called by Father Hennipin, a pelican, that is about the &s;ize of the European, crane, of a greyi&s;h color, and with long legs; but this &s;pecies differs from all others in its bill, which is about twelve inches long, and one inch and an half broad, of which breadth it con|tinues to the end, where it is blunted, and round like a paddle; its tongue is of the &s;ame length.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="021728_0256_0FB5358BDA2A2E60">DUCKS. Among a variety of wild ducks, the different &s;pecies of which amount to upwards of twenty, I &s;hall confine my de&s;cription to one &s;ort, that is, the wood duck, or, as the French term it, Canard Branchus. This fowl receives its name from its frequenting the woods, and perching on the branches of trees, which no other kind of water fowl (a characteri&s;tic that this &s;till pre&s;erves) is known to do. It is nearly of a &s;ize with other ducks; its plumage is beautifully variegated, and very brilliant. The fle&s;h of it al&s;o, as it feeds but lit|tle on fi&s;h, is finely &s;lavored, and much &s;uperior to any other &s;ort.</P>
<P>The TEAL. I have already remarked in my Journal, that the teal found on the Fox River, and the head branches of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, are perhaps not to be equalled for the fatne&s;s and delicacy of their fle&s;h by any other in the world. In color, &s;hape, and &s;ize they are very little different from tho&s;e found in other countries.</P>
<P>The LOON is a water fowl, &s;omewhat le&s;s than a real, and is a &s;pecies of the dobchick. Its wings are &s;hort, and its legs and feet large in proportion to the body; the color of it is a dark brown, nearly approach|ing to black; and as it feeds only on fi&s;h, the fle&s;h of it is very ill-flavored. The&s;e birds are exceedingly nimble and expert at diving, &s;o that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for one per&s;on to &s;hoot them, as they will dextrou&s;ly avoid the &s;hot by diving before they reach them; &s;o that it requires three per&s;ons to kill one of them, and this can only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the moment it rai&s;es its head out of the water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eturns to the &s;urface after diving.

<P>The PARTRIDGE. There are three &s;orts of partridges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the brown, the red, and the black, the fir&s;t of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t e&s;teemed.

the branches of the poplar and black birch, on the buds of which they feed early in the morning and in the twilight of the evening during the winter months, when they are ea&s;ily &s;hot.</P>
<P>The WOOD PIGEON is nearly the &s;ame as ours, and there a &s;uch prodigious quantities of them on the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, that they will &s;ometimes darken the &s;un for &s;everal minutes.</P>
<P>The WOOD PECKER. This is a very beauti|ful bird; there is one &s;ort who&s;e feathers are a mixture of various colors; and another that is brown all over the body, except the head and neck, which are of a fine red. As this bird is &s;uppo&s;ed to make a greater noi&s;e than ordinary at particular times, it is conjectured his cries then denote rain.</P>
<P>The BLUE JAY. This bird is &s;haped nearly like the European jay, only that its tail is longer. On the top of its head is a cre&s;t of blue feathers, which is rai&s;ed or let down at plea&s;ure. The lower part of the neck behind, and the back, are of a purpli&s;h color, and the upper &s;ides of the wings and tail, as well as the lower part of the back and rump, are of a fine blue; the extremities of the wings are blacki&s;h, faintly tinctur|ed with dark blue on the edges, whil&s;t the other parts of the wing are barred acro&s;s with black in an elegant manner. Upon the whole this bird can &s;carcely be ex|ceeded in beauty by any of the winged inhabitants of this or other climates. It has the &s;ame jetting moti|on that jays generally have, and its cry is far more plea&s;ing.</P>

<P>The BLACK BIRD. There are three &s;orts of birds in North-America that bear this name; the fir&s;t is the common, or as it is there termed, the crow black bird, which is quite black, and of the &s;ame &s;ize and &s;hape of tho&s;e in Europe, but it has not that melody in its notes which they have. In the month of Sep|tember this &s;ort fly in large flights, and do great mi&s;|chief to the Indian corn, which is at that time ju&s;t ripe. The &s;econd &s;ort is the red-wing, which is rather &s;maller than the fir&s;t &s;pecies, but like it is black all over its body, except on the lower rim of the wings, where it is of a fine, bright, full &s;carlet. It builds its ne&s;t, and chiefly re&s;orts among the &s;mall bu&s;hes that grow in mea|dows and low, &s;wampy places. It whi&s;tles a few notes, but is not equal in its &s;ong to the European black bird. The third &s;ort is of the &s;ame &s;ize as the latter, and is jet black like that, but all the upper part of the wing, ju&s;t below the back, is of a fine, clear white; as if nature in|tended to diver&s;ify the &s;pecies, and to atone for the want of a melodious pipe by the beauty of its plumage; for this al&s;o is deficient in its mu&s;ical powers. The beaks of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> are of a full yellow, and the females of each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> black like the European.</P>
<P>The RED BIRD is about the &s;ize of a &s;parrow, but with a long tail, and is all over of a bright vermilion color. I &s;aw many of them about the Ottawaw Lakes, but I could not learn that they &s;ung. I al&s;o ob&s;erved in &s;ome other parts, a bird of much the &s;ame make, that was entirely of a and yellow.</P>
<P>The WHETSAW is of the cuckoo kind, being like that, a &s;olitary bird, and &s;carcely ever &s;een. In the &s;ummer months it is heard in the groves, where it makes a noi&s;e like the filing of a &s;aw; from which it receives its name.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="021728_0259_0FB53598A0C0B078">The KING BIRD is like a &s;wallow, and &s;eems to be of the &s;ame &s;pecies as the black marten or &s;wift. It is called the King Bird becau&s;e it is able to ma&s;ter almo&s;t every bird that flies. I have often &s;een it bring down a hawk.</P>
<P>The HUMMING BIRD. This beautiful bird, which is the &s;malle&s;t of the feathered inhabitants of the air, is about the third part the &s;ize of a wren, and is &s;haped extremely like it. Its legs, which are about an inch long, appear like two &s;mall needles, and its body is proportionable to them. But its plumage ex|ceeds de&s;cription. On its head it has a &s;mall tuft of a jetty, &s;hining black; the brea&s;t of it is red, the belly white, the back, wings, and tail of the fine&s;t pale green; and &s;mall &s;pecks of gold are &s;cattered with inexpre&s;&s;ible grace over the whole: be&s;ides this, an almo&s;t impercepti|ble down &s;oftens the colors, and produces the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;hades.

There is al&s;o in the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and there only, another &s;ort than the &s;pecies I have de&s;crib|ed, which is &s;imilar to it in every re&s;pect, except that the upper jaw extends fourteen or fifteen inches beyond the under; this exten&s;ive jaw, which is of a gri&s;tly &s;ub|&s;tance, is three inches and a half broad, and continues of that breadth, &s;omewhat in the &s;hape of an oar, to the end, which is flat. The fle&s;h of this fi&s;h, however, is not to be compared with the other &s;ort, and is not &s;o much e&s;teemed even by the Indians.</P>
<P>The CAT FISH. This fi&s;h is about eighteen inches long; of a browni&s;h color, and without &s;cales. It has a large round head, from whence it receives its name, on different parts of which grow three or four &s;trong, &s;harp horns about two inches long. Its fins are al&s;o very bony and &s;trong, and without great care will pierce die hands of tho&s;e who take them. It weighs commonly about five or &s;ix pounds; the fle&s;h of it is exce&s;&s;ively fat and lu&s;cious, and greatly re&s;embles that of an eel in its flavor.</P>
<P>The CARP and CHUB are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e in England, and nearly about the &s;ame in &s;ize.</P>

<P>The RATTLE SNAKE. There appears to be two &s;pecies of this reptile; one of which is commonly termed the Black, and the other the Yellow; and of the&s;e the latter is generally con&s;idered as the large&s;t. At their full growth they are upwards of five feet long, and the middle part of the body, at which it is of the greate&s;t bulk, mea&s;ures about nine inches round. From that part it gradually decrea&s;es both towards the head and the tail. The neck is proportionally very &s;mall, and the head broad and depre&s;&s;ed. The&s;e are of a light brown color, the iris of the eye red, and all the upper part of the body brown, mixed with a ruddy yellow, and chequered with many regular lines of a deep black, gradually &s;hading towards a gold color. In &s;hort the whole of this dangerous reptile is very beautiful, and could it be viewed with le&s;s terror, &s;uch a variegated ar|rangement of colors would be extremely plea&s;ing. But the&s;e are only to be &s;een in their highe&s;t perfection at the time this creature is animated by re&s;entment; then every tint ru&s;hes from its &s;ubcutaneous rece&s;s, and gives the &s;urface of the &s;kin a deeper &s;tain. The belly is of a pali&s;h blue, which grows fuller as it approaches the &s;ides, and is at length intermixed with the color of the upper parts&punc; The rattle at its tail, from which it receives its name, is compo&s;ed of a firm, dry, callous, or horny &s;ub&s;tance of a light brown, and con&s;i&s;ts of a number of cells which articulate one within another, like joints; and which increa&s;e every year, and make known the age of the creature. The&s;e articulations being very loo&s;e, the included points &s;trike again&s;t the inner &s;urface of the concave parts or rings into which they are admitted, and as the &s;nake vibrates, or &s;hakes its tail, make a rattling noi&s;e. This alarm it always gives when it is apprehen&s;ive of danger; and in an in&s;tant after forms it&s;elf into a &s;piral wreath, in the centre of which appears the head erect, and breathing forth vengeance again&s;t ei|ther man or bea&s;t that &s;hall dare to come near it. In this attitude he awaits the approach of his enemies, rat|tling
<PB N="249" REF="021728_0262_0FB535A944D27B58">
his tail as he &s;ees or hears them coming on. By this timely intimation, which heaven &s;eems to have provided as a means to counteract the mi&s;chief this ve|nomous reptile would otherwi&s;e be the perpetrator of, the unwary traveller is apprized of his danger, and has an opportunity of avoiding it. It is however to be ob&s;erv|ed, that it never acts offen&s;ively; it neither pur&s;ues or flies from any thing that approaches it, but lies in the po&s;ition de&s;cribed, rattling his tail, as if reluctant to hurt. The teeth with which this &s;erpent effects his poi|&s;onous purpo&s;es are not tho&s;e he makes u&s;e of on ordina|ry occa&s;ions, they are only two in number, very &s;mall and &s;harp pointed, and fixed in a &s;inewy &s;ub&s;tance that lies near the extremity of the upper jaw, re&s;embling the claws of a cat; at the root of each of the&s;e, which might be extended, contracted, or entirely hidden, as need requires, are two &s;mall bladders which nature has &s;o con&s;tructed, that at the &s;ame in&s;tant an inci&s;ion is made by the teeth, a drop of a greeni&s;h, poi&s;onous liquid enters the wound, and taints with its de&s;tructive quality the whole ma&s;s of blood. In a moment the unfortunate victim of its wrath feels a chilly tremor run through all his frame; a &s;welling immediately begins on the &s;pot where the teeth had entered, which &s;preads by de|grees over the whole body, and produces on every part of the &s;kin the variegated hue of the &s;nake. The bite of this reptile is more or le&s;s venomous, according to the &s;ea&s;on of the year in which it is given. In the dog-days it often proves in&s;tantly mortal, and e&s;pecially if the wound is made among the &s;inews &s;ituated in the back part of the leg, above the heel; but in the &s;pring, in autumn, or during a cool day which might happen in the &s;ummer, its bad effects are to be prevented by the immediate application of proper remedies; and the&s;e Providence has bounteou&s;ly &s;upplied, by cau&s;ing the Rattle Snake Plantain, an approved antidote to the poi|&s;on of this creature, to grow in great profu&s;ion where|ever they are to be met with. There are likewi&s;e &s;e|veral other remedies be&s;ides this, for the venom of its bite. A decoction made of the buds or bark of the white a&s;h, taken internally, prevents its pernicious ef|fects.
<PB N="250" REF="021728_0263_0FB535ACEAFEB6C0">
Salt is a newly di&s;covered remedy, and if applied immediately to the part, or the wound be wa&s;hed with brine, a cure might be a&s;&s;ured. The fat of the reptile al&s;o rubbed on it is frequently found to be very efficaci|ous. But though the lives of the per&s;ons who have been bitten might be pre&s;erved by the&s;e, and their health in &s;ome degree re&s;tored, yet they annually experience a &s;light return of the dreadful &s;ymptoms about the time they received the in&s;tillation. However remarkable it may appear, it is certain, that though the venom of this creature affects, in a greater or le&s;s degree, all animated nature, the hog is an exception to the rule, as that ani|mal will readily de&s;troy them without dreading their poi&s;onous fangs, and fatten on their fle&s;h. It has been often ob&s;erved, and I can confirm the ob&s;ervation, that the Rattle Snake is charmed with any harmonious &s;ounds, whether vocal or in&s;trumental; I have many times &s;een them, even when they have been enraged, place them&s;elves in a li&s;tening po&s;ture, and continue immovably attentive and &s;u&s;ceptible of delight all the time the mu&s;ic has la&s;ted. I &s;hould have remarked, that when the Rattle Snake bites, it drops its under jaw, and holding the upper jaw erect, throws it&s;elf in a curve line, with great force, and as quick as lightning, on the object of its re&s;entment. In a moment after, it returns again to its defen&s;ive po&s;ture, having di&s;engaged its teeth from the wound with great celerity, by means of the po&s;ition in which it had placed its head when it made the attack. It never extends it&s;elf to a greater di&s;tance than half its length will reach, and though it &s;ometimes repeats the blow two or three times, it as of|ten returns with a &s;udden rebound to its former &s;tate. The Black Rattle Snake differs in no other re&s;pect from the Yellow, than in being rather &s;maller, and in the variegation of its colors, which are exactly rever&s;ed: one is black where the other is yellow, and vice ver&s;a. They are equally venomous. It is not known how the&s;e creatures engender; I have often found the eggs of &s;e|veral other &s;pecies of the &s;nake, but notwith&s;tanding no one has taken more pains to acquire a perfect know|ledge of every property of the&s;e reptiles than my&s;elf,
<PB N="251" REF="021728_0264_0FB535AE5B5F4F18">
I never could di&s;cover the manner in which they bring forth their young. I once killed a female that had &s;eventy young ones in its belly, but the&s;e were perfect|ly formed, and I &s;aw them ju&s;t before retire to the mouth of their mother, as a place of &s;ecurity, on my approach. The galls of this &s;erpent, mixed with chalk, are formed into little balls, and exported from America, for medicinal purpo&s;es. They are of the nature of Ga&s;|coign's powders, and are an excellent remedy for com|plaints incident to children. The fle&s;h of the &s;nake al|&s;o dried, and made into broth, is much more nutritive than that of vipers, and very efficacious again&s;t con|&s;umptions.</P>
<P>The LONG BLACK SNAKE. The&s;e are al&s;o of two &s;orts, both of which are exactly &s;imilar in &s;hape and &s;ize, only the belly of one is a light red, the other a faint blue; all the upper parts of their bodies are black and &s;caly. They are in general from &s;ix to eight feet in length, and carry their heads, as they crawl along, about a foot and an half from the ground. They ea&s;ily climb the highe&s;t trees in pur&s;uit of birds and &s;quirrels, which are their chief food; and the&s;e, it is &s;aid, they charm by their looks, and render incapable of e&s;|caping from them. Their appearance carries terror with it to tho&s;e who are unacquainted with their inability to hurt, but they are perfectly inoffen&s;ive and free from ve|nom.</P>
<P>The STRIPED or GARTER SNAKE is ex|actly the &s;ame as that &s;pecies found in other climates.</P>
<P>The WATER SNAKE is much like the Rattle Snake in &s;hape and &s;ize, but is not endowed with the &s;ame venomous powers, being quite harmle&s;s.</P>
<P>The HISSING SNAKE I have already particu|larly de&s;cribed, when I treated, in my Journal, of Lake Erie.</P>
<P>The GREEN SNAKE is about a foot and an half long, and in color &s;o near to gra&s;s and herbs, that it cannot be di&s;covered as it lies on the ground; happily, however, it is free from venom, otherwi&s;e it would do an infinite deal of mi&s;chief, as tho&s;e who pa&s;s through the
<PB N="252" REF="021728_0265_0FB535BA9FE1A6D0">
meadows, not being able to perceive it, are deprived of the power of avoiding it.</P>
<P>The THORN-TAIL SNAKE. This reptile is found in many parts of America, but is very &s;eldom to be &s;een. It is of a middle &s;ize, and receives its name from a thorn-like dart in its tail, with which it is &s;aid to inflict a mortal wound.</P>
<P>The SPECKLED SNAKE is an aqueous rep|tile about two feet and an half in length, but without venom. Its &s;kin, which is brown and white, with &s;ome &s;pots of yellow in it, is u&s;ed by the Americans as a cover for the handles of whips, and it renders them ve|ry plea&s;ing to the &s;ight.</P>
<P>The RING SNAKE is about twelve inches long; the body of it is entirely black, except a yellow ring which it has about its neck, and which appears like a narrow piece of riband tied around it. This odd reptile is frequently found in the bark of trees, and among old logs.</P>
<P>The TWO-HEADED SNAKE. The only &s;nake of this kind that was ever &s;een in America, was found about the year 1762, near Lake Champlain, by Mr. Park, a gentleman of New England, and made a pre|&s;ent to Lord Amher&s;t. It was about a foot long, and in &s;hape like the common &s;nake, but it was furni&s;hed with two heads exactly &s;imilar, which united at the neck. Whether this was a di&s;tinct &s;pecies of &s;nakes, and was able to propagate its likene&s;s, or whether it was an accidental formation, I know not.</P>
<P>The TORTOISE or LAND TURTLE. The &s;hape of this creature is &s;o well known that it is unne|ce&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe it. There are &s;even or eight &s;orts of them in America, &s;ome of which are beautifully varie|gated, even beyond de&s;cription. The &s;hells of many have &s;pots of red, green, and yellow in them, and the che|quer work is compo&s;ed of &s;mall &s;quares curiou&s;ly di&s;|po&s;ed. The mo&s;t beautiful &s;ort of the&s;e creatures are the &s;malle&s;t, and the bite of them is &s;aid to be venom|ous.</P>

<HEAD>LIZARDS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Though there are numerous kinds of this cla&s;s of the animal creation, in the country I treat of, I &s;hall only take notice of two of them; which are termed the Swift and the Slow Lizard.</P>
<P>The SWIFT LIZARD is about &s;ix inches long, and has four legs and a tail. Its body, which is blue, is prettily &s;triped with dark lines &s;haded with yellow; but the end of the tail is totally blue. It is &s;o remarkably agile, that in an in&s;tant it is out of &s;ight, nor can its movement be perceived by the quicke&s;t eye: &s;o that it might more ju&s;tly be &s;aid to vani&s;h, than to run away. This &s;pecies are &s;uppo&s;ed to poi&s;on tho&s;e they bite, but are not dangerous, as they never attack per|&s;ons that approach them, choo&s;ing rather to get &s;udden|ly out of their reach.</P>
<P>The SLOW LIZARD is of the &s;ame &s;hape as the Swift, but its color is brown; it is moreover of an oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;ition, being altogether as &s;low in its move|ments as the other is &s;wift. It is remarkable that the&s;e lizards are extremely brittle, and will break off near the tail as ea&s;ily as an icicle.</P>
<P>Among the reptiles of North-America, there is a &s;pe|cies of the toad, termed the TREE TOAD, which is nearly of the &s;ame &s;hape as the common &s;ort, but &s;maller and with longer claws. It is u&s;ually found on trees, &s;ticking clo&s;e to the bark, or lying in the crevices of it; and &s;o nearly does it re&s;emble the color of the tree to which it cleaves, that it is with difficulty di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from it. The&s;e creatures are only heard during the twilight of the morning and evening, or ju&s;t before and after a &s;hower of rain, when they make a croaking noi&s;e &s;omewhat &s;hriller than that of a frog, which might be heard to a great di&s;tance. They infe&s;t the woods in &s;uch numbers, that their re&s;pon&s;ive notes at the&s;e times make the air re&s;ound. It is only a &s;ummer animal, and never to be found during the winter.</P>

<HEAD>INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>The interior parts of North-America abound with nearly the &s;ame in&s;ects as are met with in the &s;ame pa|rallels of latitude; and the &s;pecies of them are &s;o nu|merous and diver&s;ified that even a &s;uccinct de&s;cription of the whole of them would fill a volume; I &s;hall there|fore confine my&s;elf to a few, which I believe are al|mo&s;t peculiar to this country; the Silk Worm, the To|bacco Worm, the Bee, the Lightning Bug, the Water Bug, and the Horned Bug.</P>
<P>The SILK WORM is nearly the &s;ame as tho&s;e of France and Italy, but will not produce the &s;ame quan|tity of &s;ilk.</P>
<P>The TOBACCO WORM is a catterpillar of the &s;ize and figure of a &s;ilk worm, it is of a fine &s;ea-green color, on its rump it has a &s;ting or horn near a quarter of an inch long.</P>
<P>The BEES in America principally lodge their ho|ney in the earth to &s;ecure it from the ravages of the bears, who are remarkably fond of it.</P>
<P>The LIGHTNING BUG or FIRE FLY is about the &s;ize of a bee, but it is of the beetle kind, having like that in&s;ect two pair of wings, the upper of which are of a firm texture, to defend it from danger. When it flies, and the wings are expanded, there is under the&s;e a kind of coat, con&s;tructed al&s;o like wings, which is lu|minous; and as the in&s;ect pa&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on, cau&s;es all the hinder part of its body to appear like a bright fiery coal. Having placed one of them on your hand, the under part only &s;hines, and throws the light on the &s;pace beneath; but as &s;oon as it &s;preads its upper wings to fly away, the whole body which lies behind them ap|pears illuminated all around. The light it gives is not con&s;tantly of the &s;ame magnitude, even when it flies; but &s;eems to depend on the expan&s;ion or contraction of the luminous coat o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wings, and is very different from that emitted in a dark night by dry wood or &s;ome kinds of fi&s;h, it having much more the appearance of real fire.
<PB N="255" REF="021728_0268_0FB535BEDC7A7F30">
They &s;eem to be &s;en&s;ible of the power they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and to know the mo&s;t &s;uitable time for exerting it, as in a very dark night they are much more numerous than at any other time. They are only &s;een during the &s;ummer months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, and then at no other time but in the night. Whether from their color, which is a du&s;ky brown, they are not then di&s;cerni|ble, or from their retiring to holes and crevices, I know not, but they are never to be di&s;covered in the day. They chiefly are &s;een in low, &s;wampy land, and appear like innumerable tran&s;ient gleams of light. In dark nights when there is much lightning without rain, they &s;eem as if they wi&s;hed either to imitate or a&s;&s;i&s;t the fla&s;hes; for during the intervals, they are uncommonly agile, and endeavor to throw out every ray they can collect. Not|with&s;tanding this effulgent appearance, the&s;e in&s;ects are perfectly harmle&s;s, you may permit them to crawl upon your hand, when five or &s;ix, if they freely exhibit their glow together, will enable you to read almo&s;t the &s;mall|e&s;t print.</P>
<P>The WATER BUG is of a brown color, about the &s;ize of a pea, and in &s;hape nearly oval; it has many legs, by means of which it pa&s;&s;es over the &s;urface of the water with &s;uch incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, that it &s;eems to &s;lide or dart it&s;elf along.</P>
<P>The HORNED BUG, or as it is &s;ometimes term|ed the STAG BEETLE, is of a du&s;ky brown color nearly approaching to black, about an inch and an half long, and half an inch broad. It has two large horns, which grow on each &s;ide of the head, and meet hori|zontally, and with the&s;e it pinches very hard; they are branched like tho&s;e of a &s;tag, from whence it receives its name. They fly about in the evening, and prove very trouble&s;ome to tho&s;e who are in the fields at that time.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit that the LOCUST is a &s;eptennial in&s;ect, as they are only &s;een, a &s;mall number of &s;trag|glers excepted, every &s;even years, when they infe&s;t the&s;e parts and the interior colonies in large &s;warms, and do a great deal of mi&s;chief. The years when they thus arrive are denominated the locu&s;t years.</P>

<P>I SHALL here ob&s;erve the &s;ame method that I have pur&s;ued in the preceding chapter, and having given a li&s;t of the trees, &amp;c. which are natives of the interior parts of North-America, particularize &s;uch only as differ from the produce of other countries, or, being little known, have not been de&s;cribed.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="type of plant">
<HEAD>OF TREES.</HEAD>
<P>The Oak, the Pine Tree, the Maple, The A&s;h, the Hemlock, the Ba&s;s or White Wood, the Cedar, the Elm, the Birch, the Fir, the Locu&s;t Tree, the Poplar, the Wickopick or Suckwick, the Spruce, the Horn-beam, and the Button Wood Tree.</P>
<P>The OAK. There are &s;everal &s;orts of oaks in the&s;e parts; the black, the white, the red, the yellow, the grey, the &s;wamp oak, and the che&s;nut oak: the five former vary but little in their external appearance, the &s;hape of the leaves, and the color of the bark being &s;o much alike, that they are &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable; but the body of the tree when &s;awed di&s;covers the variation, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in the color of the wood, they be|ing all very hard, and proper for building. The &s;wamp oak differs materially from the others both in the &s;hape of the leaf, which is &s;maller, and in the bark, which is &s;moother; and likewi&s;e as it grows only in a moi&s;t, gra|velly &s;oil. It is e&s;teemed the toughe&s;t of all woods, being &s;o &s;trong yet pliable, that it is often made u&s;e of in&s;tead of whalebone, and is equally &s;erviceable. The che&s;nut oak al&s;o is greatly different from the others, parti|cularly
<PB N="257" REF="021728_0270_0FB535C7DC052438">
in the &s;hape of the leaf, which much re&s;embles that of the che&s;nut-tree, and for this rea&s;on it is &s;o denomi|nated. It is neither &s;o &s;trong as the former &s;pecies, or &s;o tough as the latter, but is of a nature proper to be &s;plit into rails for fences, in which &s;tate it will endure a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>The PINE TREE. That &s;pecies of the pine tree peculiar to this part of the continent is the white, the quality of which I need not de&s;cribe, as the timber of it is &s;o well known under the name of deals. It grows here in great plenty, to an amazing height and &s;ize, and yields an excellent turpentine, though not in &s;uch quan|tities as tho&s;e in the northern parts of Europe.</P>
<P>The MAPLE. Of this tree there are two &s;orts, the hard and the &s;oft, both of which yield a lu&s;cious juice, from which the Indians, by boiling, make very good &s;u|gar. The &s;ap of the former is much richer and &s;weeter than the latter, but the &s;oft produces a greater quanti|ty. The wood of the hard maple is very beautifully veined and curled, and when wrought into cabinets, ta|bles, gun&s;tocks, &amp;c. is greatly valued. That of the &s;oft &s;ort differs in its texture, wanting the variegated grain of the hard; it al&s;o grows, more &s;traight and free from branches, and is more ea&s;ily &s;plit. It likewi&s;e may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the hard, as this grows in meadows and low-lands, that on the hills and up-lands. The leaves are &s;haped alike, but tho&s;e of the &s;oft maple are much the large&s;t, and of a deeper green.</P>
<P>The ASH. There are &s;everal &s;orts of this tree in the&s;e parts, but that to which I &s;hall confine my de|&s;cription, is the yellow a&s;h, which is only found near the head branches of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. This tree grows to an amazing height, and the body of it is &s;o firm and &s;ound, that the French traders who go into that coun|try from Loui&s;iana, to purcha&s;e furs, make of them pe|riaguays; this they do by excavating them by fire, and when they are completed, convey in them the produce of their trade to New Orleans, where they find a good market both for their ve&s;&s;els and cargoes. The wood of this tree greatly re&s;embles that of the common a&s;h; but it might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from any other tree by its
<PB N="258" REF="021728_0271_0FB535CDF1FB16F8">
bark; the ro&s;s or out&s;ide bark being near eight inches thick, and indented with &s;urrows more than &s;ix inches deep, which make tho&s;e that are arrived to a great bulk appear uncommonly rough; and by this peculiarity they may be readily known. The rind or in&s;ide bark is of the &s;ame thickne&s;s as that of other trees, but its color is a fine bright yellow, in&s;omuch that if it is but &s;light|ly handled, it will leave a &s;tain on the fingers, which cannot ea&s;ily be wa&s;hed away; and if in the &s;pring you peel off the bark, and touch the &s;ap, which then ri&s;es between that and the body of the tree, it will leave &s;o deep a tincture that it will require three or four days to wear it off. Many u&s;eful qualities belonging to this tree I doubt not will be di&s;covered in time, be&s;ides its proving a valuable acqui&s;ition to the dyer.</P>
<P>The HEMLOCK TREE grows in every part of America, in a greater or le&s;s degree. It is an ever|green of a very large growth, and has leaves &s;omewhat like that of the yew; it is however quite u&s;ele&s;s, and only an incumbrance to the ground, the wood being of a very coar&s;ec grain, and full of wind-&s;hakes or cracks.</P>
<P>The BASS or WHITE WOOD is a tree of a middling &s;ize, and the white&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t wood that grows; when quite dry it &s;wims on the water like a cork; in the &s;ettlements the turners make of it bowls, trenchers, and di&s;hes, which wear &s;mooth, and will la&s;t a long time; but when applied to any other purpo&s;e it is far from durable.</P>
<P>The WICKOPICK or SUCKWICK appears to be a &s;pecies of the white wood, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed from it by a peculiar quality in the bark, which when pounded, and moi&s;tened with a little water, in&s;tantly be|comes a matter of the con&s;i&s;tence and nature of &s;ize. With this the Indians pay their canoes, and it greatly ex|ceeds pitch, or any other material u&s;ually appropriated to that purpo&s;e; for be&s;ides its adhe&s;ive quality, it is of &s;o oily a nature, that the water cannot penetrate thro' it, and its repelling power abates not for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>The BUTTON WOOD is a tree of the large&s;t &s;ize, and might be di&s;tingui&s;hed by its bark, which is
<PB N="259" REF="021728_0272_0FB535D0DC00CED8">
quite &s;mooth and prettily mottled. The wood is very proper for the u&s;e of cabinet-makers. It is covered with &s;mall hard burs, which &s;pring from the branches, that appear not unlike buttons, and from the&s;e I believe it receives its name.</P>

<HEAD>NUT TREES.</HEAD>
<P>The Butter or Oil Nut, the Walnut, the Hazel Nut, the Beech Nut, the Pecan Nut, the Che&s;nut, the Hic|kory.</P>
<P>The BUTTER or OIL NUT. As no men|tion has been made by any authors of this nut, I &s;hall be the more particular in my account of it. The tree grows in meadows where the &s;oil is rich and warm. The body of it &s;eldom exceeds a yard in circumference, is full of branches, the twigs of which are &s;hort and blunt, and its leaves re&s;emble tho&s;e of the walnut. The nut has a &s;hell like that fruit, which when ripe is more fur|rowed, and more ea&s;ily cracked; it is al&s;o much longer and larger than a walnut, and contains a greater quantity of kernel, which is very oily, and of a rich, agreeable flavor. I am per&s;uaded that a much purer oil than that of olives might be extracted from this nut. The in&s;ide bark of this tree dyes a good purple; and it is &s;aid, va|ries in its &s;hade, being either darker or lighter, accord|ing to the month in which it is gathered.</P>
<P>The BEECH NUT. Though this tree grows exactly like that of the &s;ame name in Europe, yet it produces nuts equally as good as che&s;nuts; on which bears, martens, &s;quirrels, partridges, turkies, and many other bea&s;ts and birds feed. The nut is contained, whil&s;t growing, in an out&s;ide ca&s;e, like that of a che&s;nut, but not &s;o prickly; and the coat of the in&s;ide &s;hell is al&s;o &s;mooth like that; only its form is nearly triangular. Va&s;t quantities of them lie &s;cattered about in the woods, and &s;upply with food great numbers of the creatures ju&s;t
<PB N="260" REF="021728_0273_0FB535DA0B94C478">
mentioned. The leaves, which are white, continue on the trees during the whole winter. A decoction made of them is a certain and expeditious cure for wounds which ari&s;e from burning or &s;calding, as well as a re&s;torative for tho&s;e members that are nipped by the fro&s;t.</P>
<P>The PECAN NUT is &s;omewhat of the walnut kind, but rather &s;maller than a walnut, being about the &s;ize of a middling acorn, and of an oval form; the &s;hell is ea&s;ily cracked, and the kernel &s;haped like that of a walnut. This tree grows chiefly near the Illinois River.</P>
<P>The HICKORY is al&s;o of the walnut kind, and bears a fruit nearly like that tree. There are &s;everal &s;orts of them, which vary only in the color of the wood. Being of a very tough nature, the wood is generally u&s;ed for the handles of axes, &amp;c. It is al&s;o very good fire-wood, and as it burns, an excellent &s;ugar di&s;tils from it.</P>

<HEAD>FRUIT TREES.</HEAD>
<P>I need not to ob&s;erve that the&s;e are all the &s;ponta|neous productions of nature, which have never received the advantages of ingrafting, tran&s;planting, or manur|ing.</P>
<P>The Vine, the Mulberry Tree, the Crab Apple Tree, the Plum Tree, the Cherry Tree, and the Sweet Gum Tree.</P>
<P>The VINE is very common here, and of three kinds; the fir&s;t &s;ort hardly de&s;erves the name of a grape; the &s;econd much re&s;embles the Burgundy grape, and if ex|po&s;ed to the &s;un a good wine might be made from them. The third &s;ort re&s;embles Zant currants, which are &s;o frequently u&s;ed in cakes, &amp;c. in England, and if proper care was taken of them, would be equal, if not &s;uperior, to tho&s;e of that country.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="021728_0274_0FB535DB5AB4B738">The MULBERRY TREE is of two kinds, red and white, and nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize of tho&s;e of France and Italy, and grow in &s;uch plenty, as to feed any quantity of &s;ilk worms.</P>
<P>The CRAB APPLE TREE bears a fruit that is much larger and better flavored than tho&s;e of Europe.</P>
<P>The PLUM TREE. There are two &s;orts of plums in this country, one a large &s;ort of a purple ca&s;t on one &s;ide, and red on the rever&s;e, the &s;econd totally green, and much &s;maller. Both the&s;e are of a good flavor, and are greatly e&s;teemed by the Indians, who&s;e ta&s;te is not refined, but who are &s;atisfied with the pro|ductions of nature in their unimproved &s;tate.</P>
<P>The CHERRY TREE. There are three &s;orts of cherries in this country; the black, the red, and the &s;and cherry; the two latter may with more propriety be ranked among the &s;hrubs, as the bu&s;h that bears the &s;and cherries almo&s;t creeps along the ground, and the other ri&s;es not above eight or ten feet in height; however I &s;hall give an account of them all in this place. The black cherries are about the &s;ize of a currant, and hang in clu&s;ters like grapes; the trees which bear them being very fruitful, they are generally loaded, but the fruit is not good to eat, however they give an agreeable flavor to brandy, and turn it to the color of claret. The red cherries grow in the greate&s;t profu&s;ion, and hang in bunches, like the black &s;ort ju&s;t de&s;cribed; &s;o that the bu&s;hes which bear them appear at a di&s;tance like &s;olid bodies of red matter. Some people admire this fruit, but they partake of the nature and ta&s;te of alum, leav|ing a di&s;agreeable roughne&s;s in the throat, and being very a&s;tringent. As I have already de&s;cribed the &s;and cherries, which greatly exceed the two other &s;orts, both in flavor and &s;ize, I &s;hall give no further de&s;cription of them. The wood of the black cherry tree is very u&s;e|ful, and works well into cabinet ware.</P>
<P>The SWEET GUM TREE or LIQUID AMBER (Copalm) is not only extremely common, but it affords a balm, the virtues of which are infinite. Its bark is black and hard, and its wood &s;o tender and &s;upple, that
<PB N="262" REF="021728_0275_0FB535DCDE0B9EB0">
when the tree is felled, you may draw from the middle of it rods of five or &s;ix feet in length. It cannot be employ|ed in building or furniture, as it warps continually. Its leaf is indented with five points, like a &s;tar. This balm is reckoned by the Indians to be an excellent febrifuge, and it cures wounds in two or three days.</P>

<P>The WILLOW. There are &s;everal &s;pecies of the willow, the mo&s;t remarkable of which is a &s;mall &s;ort that grows on the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and &s;ome other places adjacent. The bark of this &s;hrub &s;upplies the beaver with its winter food; and where the water has wa&s;hed the &s;oil from its roots, they appear to con&s;i&s;t of fibres interwoven together like thread, the color of which is of an inexpre&s;&s;ibly fine &s;carlet; with this the Indians tinge many of the ornamental parts of their dre&s;s.</P>
<P>SHIN WOOD. This extraordinary &s;hrub grows in the fore&s;ts, and ri&s;ing like a vine, runs near the ground for &s;ix or eight feet, and then takes root again; in the &s;ame manner taking root, and &s;pringing up &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, one &s;talk covers a large &s;pace; this proves very trouble|&s;ome to the ha&s;ty traveller, by &s;triking again&s;t his &s;hins, and entangling his legs; from which it has acquired its name.</P>
<P>The SASSAFRAS is a wood well known for its medicinal qualities. It might with equal propriety be
<PB N="263" REF="021728_0276_0FB535E3F2DE7218">
termed a tree at a &s;hrub, as it &s;ometimes grows thirty feet high; but in general it does not reach higher than tho&s;e of the &s;hrub kind. The leaves, which yield an agreeable fragrance, are large, and nearly &s;eparated in|to three divi&s;ions. It bears a reddi&s;h brown berry, of the &s;ize and &s;hape of Pimento, and which is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in the colonies as a &s;ub&s;titute for that &s;pice. The bark or roots of this tree is infinitely &s;uperior to the wood for its u&s;e in medicine, and I am &s;urpri&s;ed it is &s;o &s;eldom to be met with, as its efficacy is &s;o much greater.</P>
<P>The PRICKLY ASH is a &s;hrub that &s;ome|times grows to the height of ten or fifteen feet, and has a leaf exactly re&s;embling that of an a&s;h, but it re|ceives the epithet to its name from the abundance of &s;hort thorns with which every branch is covered, and which renders it very trouble&s;ome to tho&s;e who pa&s;s through the &s;pot where they grow thick. It al&s;o bears a &s;carlet berry, which when ripe, has a fiery ta&s;te, like pepper. The bark of this tree, particularly the bark of the roots, is highly e&s;teemed by the natives for its medi|cinal qualities. I have already mentioned one in&s;tance of its efficacy, and there is no doubt but that the de|coction of it will expeditiou&s;ly and radically remove all impurities of the blood.</P>
<P>The MOOSE WOOD grows about four feet high, and is very full of branches; but what renders it worth notice is its bark, which is of &s;o &s;trong and pliable a texture, that being peeled off at any &s;ea&s;on, and twi&s;ted, makes equally as good cordage as hemp.</P>
<P>The SPOON WOOD is a &s;pecies of the lau|rel, and the wood when &s;awed re&s;embles box wood.</P>
<P>The ELDER, commonly termed the poi&s;onous el|der, nearly re&s;embles the other &s;orts in its leaves and branches, but it grows much &s;traighter, and is only found in &s;wamps and moi&s;t &s;oils. This &s;hrub is endowed with a very extraordinary quality, that renders it poi&s;onous to &s;ome con&s;titutions, which it effects if the per&s;on on|ly approaches within a few yards of it, whil&s;t others may even chew the leaves or the rind without receiving the lea&s;t detriment from them: the poi&s;on however is not

mortal, though it operates very violently on the infected per&s;on, who&s;e body and head &s;well to an amazing &s;ize, and are covered with eruptions, that at their height re|&s;emble the confluent &s;mall-pox. As it grows al&s;o in many of the provinces, the inhabitants cure its venom by drinking &s;affron tea, and anointing the external parts with a mixture compo&s;ed of cream and mar&s;h mallows.</P>
<P>The SHRUB OAK is exactly &s;imilar to the oak tree, both in its wood and leaves, and like that it bears an acorn, but it never ri&s;es from the ground above four or five feet, growing crooked and knotty. It is found chiefly on a dry, gravelly &s;oil.</P>
<P>The WITCH HAZLE grows very bu&s;hy, about ten feet high, and is covered early in May with numerous white blo&s;&s;oms. When this &s;hrub is in bloom, the Indians e&s;teem it a further indication that the fro&s;t is entirely gone, and that they might &s;ow their corn. It has been &s;aid, that it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of attract|ing gold and &s;ilver, and that twigs of it are made u&s;e of to di&s;cover where the veins of the&s;e metals lie hid; but I am apprehen&s;ive that this is only a fallacious &s;tory, and not to be depended on; however that &s;uppo&s;ition has given it the name of Witch Hazle.</P>
<P>The MYRTLE WAX TREE is a &s;hrub about four or five feet high, the leaves of which are larger than tho&s;e of the common myrtle, but they &s;mell exactly alike. It bears its fruit in bunches, like a no&s;egay, ri&s;ing from the &s;ame place in various &s;talks, about two inches long: at the end of each of the&s;e is a little nut containing a kernel, which is wholly covered with a gluey &s;ub&s;tance, which being boiled in water, &s;wims on the &s;urface of it, and becomes a kind of green wax; this is more valuable than bees-wax, being of a more brittle nature, but mixed with it makes a good candle, which, as it burns, &s;ends forth an agreeable &s;cent.</P>
<P>WINTER GREEN. This is an ever-green, of the &s;pecies of the myrtle, and is found on dry heaths; the flowers of it are white, and in the form of a ro&s;e, but not larger than a &s;ilver penny; in the winter it is full of red berries, about the &s;ize of a &s;loe, which are &s;mooth and round; the&s;e are pre&s;erved during the &s;evere

&s;ea&s;on by the &s;now, and are at that time in the highe&s;t perfection. The Indians eat the&s;e berries, e&s;teeming them very bal&s;amic, and invigorating to the &s;tomach. The people inhabiting the interior colonies &s;teep both the &s;prigs and berries in beer, and u&s;e it as a diet drink for clean&s;ing the blood from &s;corbutic di&s;orders.</P>
<P>The FEVER BUSH grows about five or &s;ix feet high; its leaf is like that of a lilach, and it bears a reddi&s;h berry of a &s;picy flavor. The &s;talks of it are exce&s;&s;ively brittle. A decoction of the buds or wood is an excellent febrifuge, and from this valuable property it receives its name. It is an ancient Indian remedy for all inflammatory complaints, and likewi&s;e much e&s;teemed on the &s;ame account, by the inhabitants of the interior parts of the colonies.</P>
<P>The CRANBERRY BUSH. Though the fruit of this bu&s;h greatly re&s;embles in &s;ize and appear|ance that of the common &s;ort, which grows on a &s;mall vine, in mora&s;&s;es and bogs, yet the bu&s;h runs to the height of ten or twelve feet; but it is very rarely to be met with. As the meadow cranberry, being of a local growth, and flouri&s;hing only in mora&s;&s;es, cannot be tran&s;|planted or cultivated, the former, if removed at a pro|per &s;ea&s;on, would be a valuable acqui&s;ition to the garden, and with proper nurture prove equally as good, if not better.</P>
<P>The CHOAK BERRY. The &s;hrub thus term|ed by the natives grows about five or &s;ix feet high, and bears a berry about the &s;ize of a &s;loe, of a jet black, which contains &s;everal &s;mall feeds within the pulp. The juice of this fruit, though not of a di&s;agreeable flavor, is extremely tart, and leaves a roughne&s;s in the mouth and throat when eaten, that has gained it the name of choak berry.</P>

<P>SPIKENARD, vulgarly called in the colonies Petty-Morrel. This plant appears to be exactly the &s;ame as the A&s;iatic &s;pikenard, &s;o much valued by the ancients. It grows near the &s;ides of brooks, in rocky places, and its &s;tem, which is about the &s;ize of a goo&s;e quill, &s;prings up like that of angelica, reaching about a foot and an half from the ground. It bears bunches of berries in all re&s;pects like tho&s;e of the elder, only rather larger. The&s;e are of &s;uch a bal&s;amic nature, that when infu&s;ed in &s;pirits, they make a mo&s;t palatable and reviving cordial.</P>
<P>SARSAPARILLA. The root of this plant, which is the mo&s;t e&s;timable part of it, is about the &s;ize of a goo&s;e quill, and runs in different directions, twined and crooked to a great length in the ground; from the principal &s;tem of it &s;pring many &s;maller fibres, all of which are tough and flexible. From the root immedi|ately &s;hoots a &s;talk about a foot and an half long, which at the top branches into three &s;tems; each of the&s;e has three leaves, much of the &s;hape and &s;ize of a walnut leaf; and from the fork of each of the three &s;tems grows a bunch of blui&s;h white flowers, re&s;embling tho&s;e of the &s;pikenard. The bark of the roots, which alone &s;hould be u&s;ed in medicine, is of a bitteri&s;h flavor, but aromatic. It is de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed for its medicinal virtues, being a gentle &s;udorific, and very powerful in attenuating the blood when impeded by gro&s;s humors.</P>
<P>GINSANG is a root that was once &s;uppo&s;ed to grow only in Korea, from whence it was u&s;ually exported to Japan, and by that means found its way to Europe: but it has been lately di&s;covered to be al&s;o a native of North-America, where it grows to as great perfection, and is equally valuable. Its root is like a &s;mall carrot, but not &s;o taper at the end; it is &s;ometimes divided into two or more branches, in all other re&s;pects it re|&s;embles &s;ar&s;aparilla in its growth. The ta&s;te of the root is bitteri&s;h. In the ea&s;tern parts of A&s;ia it bears a great price, being there con&s;idered as a panacea, and is the la&s;t
<PB N="267" REF="021728_0280_0FB535F59F027618">
refuge of the inhabitants in all di&s;orders. When chew|ed it certainly is a great &s;trengthener of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>GOLD THREAD. This is a plant of the &s;mall vine kind, which grows in &s;wampy places, and lies on the ground. The roots &s;pread them&s;elves ju&s;t under the &s;urface of the mora&s;s, and are ea&s;ily drawn up by handfuls. They re&s;emble a large entangled &s;kein of thread, of a fine, bright gold color; and I am per&s;uad|ed would yield a beautiful and permanent yellow dye. It is al&s;o greatly e&s;teemed both by the Indians and colo|ni&s;ts as a remedy for any &s;orene&s;s in the mouth, but the ta&s;te of it is exqui&s;itely bitter.</P>
<P>SOLOMON's SEAL is a plant that grows on the &s;ides of rivers, and in rich meadow land. It ri&s;es in the whole to about three feet high, the &s;talks being two feet, when the leaves begin to &s;pread them&s;elves and reach a foot further. A part in every root has an im|pre&s;&s;ion upon it about the &s;ize of a &s;ixpence, which appears as if it was made by a &s;eal, and from the&s;e it receives its name. It is greatly valued on account of its being a fine purifier of the blood.</P>
<P>DEVIL's BIT is another wild plant, which grows in the fields, and receives its name from a print that &s;eems to be made by teeth in the roots. The Indians &s;ay that this was once an univer&s;al remedy for every di&s;order that human nature is incident to; but &s;ome of the evil &s;pirits envying mankind the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of &s;o efficacious a medicine, gave the root a bite, which deprived it of a great part of its virtue.</P>
<P>BLOOD ROOT. A &s;ort of plantain that &s;prings out of the ground in &s;ix or &s;even long, rough leaves, the veins of which are red; the root of it is like a &s;mall car|rot, both in color and appearance; when broken, the in&s;ide of it is of a deeper color than the out&s;ide, and di&s;tils &s;everal drops of juice that look like blood.

So convinced are the Indians of the power of this infallible antidote, that for a trifling bribe of &s;pirituous liquor, they will at any time permit a rattle &s;nake to drive his fangs into their fle&s;h.

<P>WAKE ROBIN is an herb that grows in &s;wam|py lands; its root re&s;embles a &s;mall turnip, and if ta&s;ted will greatly inflame the tongue, and immediately convert

it from its natural &s;hape into a round hard &s;ub&s;tance; in which &s;tate it will continue for &s;ome time, and during this no other part of the mouth will be affected. But when dried, it lo&s;es its a&s;tringent quality, and becomes beneficial to mankind, for if grated into cold water, and taken internally, it is very good for all complaints of the bowels.</P>
<P>WILD INDIGO is an herb of the &s;ame &s;pecies as that from whence indigo is made in the &s;outhern colo|nies. It grows in one &s;talk to the height of five or &s;ix inches from the ground, when it divides into many branches, from which i&s;&s;ue a great number of &s;mall hard blui&s;h leaves that &s;pread to a great breadth, and among the&s;e it bears a yellow flower; the juice of it has a very di&s;agreeable &s;cent.</P>
<P>CAT MINT has a woody root, divided into &s;e|veral branches, and it &s;ends forth a &s;talk about three feet high; the leaves are like tho&s;e of the nettle or betony, and they have a &s;trong &s;mell of mint, with a biting acrid ta&s;te; the flowers grow on the tops of the branches, and are of a faint purple or whiti&s;h color. It is called cat mint, becau&s;e it is &s;aid that cats have an antipathy to it, and will not let it grow. It has nearly the virtues of common mint. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For an account of Tobacco, &s;ee a treati&s;e I have publi&s;hed on the culture of that plant.</NOTE></P>

<P>Maize or Indian Corn, Wild Rice, Beans, the Squa&s;h, &amp;c.</P>
<P>MAIZE or INDIAN CORN grows from &s;ix to ten feet high, on a &s;talk full of joints, which is &s;tiff and &s;olid, and when green, abounding with a &s;weet juice. The leaves are like tho&s;e of the reed, about two feet in length, and three or four inches broad. The flowers which are produced at &s;ome di&s;tance from the fruit on the &s;ame plant, grow like the ears of oats, and are &s;ometimes white, yellow, or of a purple color. The &s;eeds are as large as pea&s;e, and like them quite naked and &s;mooth, but of a roundi&s;h &s;urface, rather compre&s;&s;ed. One &s;pike generally con&s;i&s;ts of about &s;ix hundred grains, which are placed clo&s;ely together in rows to the num|ber of eight or ten, and &s;ometimes twelve. This corn is very whole&s;ome, ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and yields as good nouri&s;hment as any other &s;ort. After the Indians have reduced it into meal by pounding it, they make cakes of it, and bake them before the fire. I have already mentioned that &s;ome nations eat it in cakes before it is ripe, in which &s;tate it is very agreeable to the palate, and extremely nutritive.</P>
<P>WILD RICE. This grain, which grows in the greate&s;t plenty throughout the interior parts of North-America, is the mo&s;t valuable of all the &s;pontaneous pro|ductions of that country. Exclu&s;ive of its utility as a &s;upply of food for tho&s;e of the human &s;pecies, who in|habit this part of the continent, and obtained without any other trouble than that of gathering it in, the &s;weet|ne&s;s and nutritious quality of it attracts an infinite num|ber of wild fowl of every kind, which flock from di&s;|tant climes, to enjoy this rare repa&s;t; and by it become inexpre&s;&s;ibly fat and delicious. In future periods it will be of great &s;ervice to the infant colonies, as it will af|ford them a pre&s;ent &s;upport, until, in the cour&s;e of cul|tivation,
<PB N="272" REF="021728_0285_0FB5360A9ABEF450">
other &s;upplies may be produced; whereas in tho&s;e realms which are not furni&s;hed with this bounte|ous gift of nature, even if the climate is temperate and the &s;oil good, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers are often expo&s;ed to great hard&s;hips from the want of an immediate re&s;ource for nece&s;&s;ary food. This u&s;eful grain grows in the wa|ter where it is about two feet deep, and where it finds a rich, muddy &s;oil. The &s;talks of it, and the branches or ears that bear the &s;eed, re&s;emble oats both in their appearance and manner of growing. The &s;talks are full of joints, and ri&s;e more than eight feet above the water. The natives gather the grain in the following manner: Nearly about the time that it begins to turn from its milky &s;tate and to ripen, they run their canoes into the mid&s;t of it, and tying bunches of it together, ju&s;t be|low the ears, with bark, leave it in this &s;ituation three or four weeks longer, till it is perfectly ripe. About the latter end of September they return to the river, when each family having its &s;eparate allotment, and be|ing able to di&s;tingui&s;h their own property by the man|ner of fa&s;tening the &s;heaves, gather in the portion that belongs to them. This they do by placing their canoes clo&s;e to the bunches of rice, in &s;uch po&s;ition as to re|ceive the grain when it falls, and then beat it out, with pieces of wood formed for that purpo&s;e. Having done this, they dry it with &s;moke, and afterwards tread or rub off the out&s;ide hu&s;k; when it is fit for u&s;e they put it into the &s;kins of fawns, or young buffalos, taken off nearly whole for this purpo&s;e, and &s;ewed into a &s;ort of &s;ack, wherein they pre&s;erve it till the return of their har|ve&s;t. It has been the &s;ubject of much &s;peculation, why this &s;pontaneous grain is not found in any other regions of America, or in tho&s;e countries &s;ituated in the &s;ame parallels of latitude, where the waters are as apparently adapted for its growth as in the climate I treat of. As for in&s;tance, none of the countries that lie to the &s;outh and ea&s;t of the great lakes, even from the provinces north of the Carolinas, to the extremities of Labradore, produce any of this grain. It is true I found great quantities of it in the watered lands near Detroit, be|tween Lake Huron and Lake Erie, but on inquiry I
<PB N="273" REF="021728_0286_0FB5360D9D6321E0">
learned that it never arrived nearer to maturity than ju&s;t to blo&s;&s;om; after which it appeared blighted, and died away. This convinces me that the north-we&s;t wind, as I have before hinted, is much more powerful in the&s;e than in the interior parts; and that it is more inimical to the fruits of the earth, after it has pa&s;&s;ed over the lakes, and become united with the wind which joins it from the frozen regions of the north, than it is further to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>BEANS. The&s;e are nearly of the &s;ame &s;hape as the European beans, but are not much larger than the &s;malle&s;t &s;ize of them. They are boiled by the Indians, and eaten chiefly with bear's fle&s;h.</P>
<P>The SQUASH. They have al&s;o &s;everal &s;pecies of the MELON or PUMPKIN, which by &s;ome are called &s;qua&s;hes, and which &s;erve many nations partly as a &s;ub&s;titute for bread. Of the&s;e there is the round, the crane-neck, the &s;mall flat, and the large oblong &s;qua&s;h. The &s;maller &s;orts being boiled, are eaten during the &s;ummer as vegetables; and are all of a plea&s;ing fla|vor. The crane-neck, which greatly excels all the others, are u&s;ually hung up for a winter's &s;tore, and in this manner might be pre&s;erved for &s;everal months.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE countries that lie between the great lakes and River Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and from thence &s;outhward to We&s;t Florida, although in the mid&s;t of a large conti|nent, and at a great di&s;tance from the &s;ea, are &s;o &s;ituat|ed, that a communication between them and other realms might conveniently be opened; by which means tho&s;e empires or colonies that may hereafter be founded or planted therein, will be rendered commercial ones. The great River Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, which runs through the whole of them, will enable their inhabitants to e&s;tabli&s;h an intercour&s;e with foreign climes, equally as well as the Euphrates, the Nile, the Danube, or the Wolga do tho&s;e people which dwell on their banks, and who have no other convenience for exporting the produce of their own country, or for importing tho&s;e of others, than boats and ve&s;&s;els of light burden: notwith&s;tanding which, they have become powerful and opulent &s;tates.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, as I have before ob&s;erved, runs from north to &s;outh, and pa&s;&s;es through the mo&s;t fertile and temperate part of North-America, excluding only the extremities of it, which verge both on the torrid and frigid zones. Thus favorably &s;ituated, when once its banks are covered with inhabitants, they need not long be at a lo&s;s for means to e&s;tabli&s;h an exten&s;ive and pro|fitable commerce. They will find the country towards the &s;outh almo&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly producing &s;ilk, cotton, indigo, and tobacco; and the more northern parts, wine, oil, beef, tallow, &s;kins, buffalo-wool, and furs; with lead, copper, iron, coals, lumber, corn, rice, and fruits, be&s;ides earth and barks for dying.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles, with which it abounds even to profu|&s;ion, may be tran&s;ported to the ocean through this river without greater difficulty than that which attends the conveyance of merchandi&s;e down &s;ome of tho&s;e I have
<PB N="275" REF="021728_0288_0FB597256132B3F8">
ju&s;t mentioned. It is true that the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi being the boundary between the Engli&s;h and Spani&s;h &s;ettle|ments, and the Spaniards in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mouth of it, they may ob&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age of it, and greatly di&s;|hearten tho&s;e who make the fir&s;t attempts; yet when the advantages that will certainly ari&s;e to &s;ettlers, are known, multitudes of adventurers, allured by the pro&s;|pect of &s;uch abundant riches, will flock to it, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h them&s;elves, though at the expence of rivers of blood.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the nation that happens to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of New Orleans prove unfriendly to the internal &s;ettlers, they may find a way into the Gulf of Mexico, by the river Iberville, which empties it&s;elf from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, after pa&s;&s;ing through Lake Maurepas, into Lake Ponchartrain, which has a communication with the &s;ea within the borders of We&s;t Florida. The Ri|ver Iberville branches off from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi about eighty miles above New Orleans, and though it is at pre|&s;ent choked up in &s;ome parts, it might at an incon&s;ider|able expence be made navigable, &s;o as to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Although the Engli&s;h have acquired &s;ince the la&s;t peace a more exten&s;ive knowledge of the interior parts than were ever obtained before, even by the French, yet many of their productions &s;till remain unknown. And though I was not deficient either in a&s;&s;iduity or attention during the &s;hort time I remained in them, yet I mu&s;t acknowledge that the intelligence I gained was not &s;o perfect as I could wi&s;h, and that it requires further re|&s;earches to make the world thoroughly acquainted with the real value of the&s;e long hidden realms.</P>
<P>The parts of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi of which no &s;urvey has hitherto been taken, amount to upwards of eight hun|dred miles, following the cour&s;e of the &s;tream, that is, from the Illinois to the Oui&s;con&s;in Rivers. Plans of &s;uch as reach from the former to the Gulph of Mexi|co, have been delineated by &s;everal hands, and I have the plea&s;ure to find that an actual &s;urvey of the inter|mediate parts of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, between the Illinois River and the &s;ea, with the Ohio, Cherokee, and Oua|bache

I flatter my&s;elf that the ob&s;ervations therein contained, which have been made by one who&s;e knowledge of the parts therein de&s;cribed was acquired by a per&s;onal inve&s;tigation, aided by a &s;olid judgment, will confirm the remarks I have made, and promote the plan I am here recommending.</P>
<P>I &s;hall al&s;o here give a conci&s;e de&s;cription of each, beginning, according to the rule of geographers, with that which lies mo&s;t to the north.</P>
<P>It is however nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that before the&s;e &s;ettlements can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, grants mu&s;t be procured in the manner cu&s;tomary on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and the lands be purcha&s;ed of tho&s;e who have acquired a right to them by a long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but no greater difficulty will attend the completion of this point, than the original founders of every colony on the continent met with to ob&s;truct their intentions; and the number of Indians who inhabit the&s;e tracts being greatly inadequate to their ex|tent, it is not to be doubted, but they will readily give up for a rea&s;onable con&s;ideration, territories that are of little u&s;e to them; or remove for the accommodation of their new neighbors, to lands at a greater di&s;tance from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, the navigation of which is not e&s;&s;ential to the welfare of their communities.</P>
<P>No. I. The country within the&s;e lines, from its &s;itua|tion, is colder than any of the others; yet I am con|vinced that the air is much more temperate than in tho&s;e provinces that lie in the &s;ame degree of latitude to the ea&s;t of it. The &s;oil is excellent, and there is a great deal of land that is free from woods in the parts adjoin|ing to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; whil&s;t on the contrary the north-ea&s;tern borders of it are well wooded. Towards the heads of the River Saint Croix, rice grows in great plenty, and there is abundance of copper. Though the falls of Saint Anthony are &s;ituated at the &s;outh-ea&s;t corner of this divi&s;ion, yet that impediment will not to|tally ob&s;truct the navigation, as the River Saint Croix,
<PB N="277" REF="021728_0290_0FB59727C6CCD458">
which runs through a great part of the &s;outhern &s;ide of it, enters the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi ju&s;t below the Falls, and flows with &s;o gentle a current, that it affords a convenient navigation for boats. This tract is about one hundred miles from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, and one hundred and twenty miles from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P>No. II. This tract, as I have already de&s;cribed it in my Journal, exceeds the highe&s;t encomiums I can give it; notwith&s;tanding which it is entirely uninhabited, and the profu&s;ion of ble&s;&s;ings that nature has &s;howered on this heavenly &s;pot, return unenjoyed to the lap from whence they &s;prung. Lake Pepin, as I have termed it after the French, lies within the&s;e bounds; but the lake to which that name properly belongs is a little above the River St. Croix; however, as all the traders call the lower lake by that name, I have &s;o denominated it, contrary to the information I received from the Indians. This colony lying in unequal angles, the dimen&s;ions of it cannot be exactly given, but it appears to be on an average about one hundred and ten miles long, and eighty broad.</P>
<P>No. III. The greate&s;t part of this divi&s;ion is &s;ituat|ed on the River Oui&s;con&s;in, which is navigable for boats about one hundred and eighty miles, till it reaches the carrying place that divides it from the Fox River. The land which is contained within its limits, is in &s;ome parts mountainous, and in others con&s;i&s;ts of fertile mea|dows and fine pa&s;turage. It is furni&s;hed al&s;o with a great deal of good timber, and, as is generally the ca&s;e on the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi and its branches, has much fine, open, clear land, proper for cultivation. To the&s;e are added an inexhau&s;tible fund of riches, in a number of lead mines which lie at a little di&s;tance from the Oui&s;con&s;in towards the &s;outh, and appear to be un|commonly full of ore. Although the Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kies and Ot|tagaumies inhabit a part of this tract, the whole of the lands under their cultivation does not exceed three hundred acres. It is in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t about one hundred and fifty miles, and about eighty from north to &s;outh.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="021728_0291_0FB5972945727860">No. IV. This colony con&s;i&s;ts of lands of various denominations, &s;ome of which are very good, and others very bad. The be&s;t is &s;ituated on the borders of the Green Bay and the Fox River, where there are innu|merable acres covered with fine gra&s;s, mo&s;t part of which grows to an a&s;toni&s;hing height. This river will afford a good navigation for boats throughout the whole of its cour&s;e, which is about one hundred and eighty miles, except between the Winnebago Lake, and the Green Bay; where there are &s;everal carrying-places in the &s;pace of thirty miles. The Fox River is rendered remarkable by the abundance of rice that grows on its &s;hores, and the almo&s;t infinite numbers of wild fowl that frequent its banks. The land which lies near it appears to be very fertile, and promi&s;es to produce a &s;ufficient &s;upply of all the nece&s;&s;aries of life for any number of inhabitants. A communication might be opened by tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;ettle here, either through the Green Bay, Lake Mi|chigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario with Canada, or by way of the Oui&s;con&s;in into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. This divi&s;ion is about one hundred and &s;ixty miles long from north to &s;outh, and one hundred and forty broad.</P>
<P>No. V. This is an excellent tract of land, and, con|&s;idering its interior &s;ituation, has greater advantages than could be expected; for having the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi on its we&s;tern borders, and the Illinois in its &s;outh-ea&s;t, it has as free a navigation as mo&s;t of the others. The northern parts of it are &s;omewhat mountainous, but it contains a great deal of clear land, the &s;oil of which is excellent, with many fine fertile meadows, and not a few rich mines. It is upwards of two hundred miles from north to &s;outh, and one hundred and fifty from ea&s;t to we&s;t.</P>
<P>No. VI. This colony being &s;ituated upon the heads of the Rivers Illinois and Ouabache, the former of which empties it&s;elf immediately into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and the latter into the &s;ame river by means of the Ohio, will readily find a communication with the &s;ea through the&s;e. Having al&s;o the River Miamis pa&s;&s;ing through it, which runs into Lake Erie, an intercour&s;e might be e&s;tabli&s;hed with Canada al&s;o by way of the lakes, as be|fore
<PB N="279" REF="021728_0292_0FB5973291667F90">
pointed out. It contains a great deal of rich fer|tile land, and though more inland than any of the others, will be as valuable an acqui&s;ition as the be&s;t of them. From north to &s;outh it is about one hundred and &s;ixty miles, from ea&s;t to we&s;t one hundred and eighty.</P>
<P>No. VII. This divi&s;ion is not inferior to any of the foregoing. Its northern borders lying adjacent to the Illinois river, and its we&s;tern to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, the &s;ituation of it for e&s;tabli&s;hing a commercial intercour&s;e with foreign nations is very commodious. It abounds with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and is about one hundred and fifty miles from north to &s;outh, and &s;ixty miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t; but the confines of it being more irregular than the others, I cannot exactly a&s;certain the dimen|&s;ions of it.</P>
<P>No. VIII. This colony having the River Ouabache running through the centre of it, and the Ohio for its &s;outhern boundary, will enjoy the advantages of a free navigation. It extends about one hundred and forty miles from north to &s;outh, and one hundred and thirty from ea&s;t to we&s;t.</P>
<P>No. IX. X. and XI. being &s;imilar in &s;ituation, and furni&s;hed with nearly the &s;ame conveniencies as all the others, I &s;hall only give their dimen&s;ions. No. IX. is about eighty miles each way, but not exactly &s;quare. No. X. is nearly in the &s;ame form, and about the &s;ame extent. No. XI. is much larger, being at lea&s;t one hundred and fifty miles from north to &s;outh, and one hundred and forty from ea&s;t to we&s;t, as nearly as from its irregularity it is po&s;&s;ible to calculate.</P>
<P>After the de&s;cription of this delightful country I have already given, I need not repeat that all the &s;pots I have thus pointed out as proper for colonization, abound not only with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, being well &s;tored with rice, deer, buffalos, bears, &amp;c. but produce in equal abundance &s;uch as may be termed luxuries, or at lea&s;t tho&s;e articles of commerce before recited, which the inhabitants of it will have an opportunity of exchanging for the needful productions of other countries.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="021728_0293_0FB59733D4084008">The di&s;covery of a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age to India has been the &s;ubject of innumerable di&s;qui&s;itions. Many ef|forts likewi&s;e have been made by way of Hud&s;on's Bay, to penetrate into the Pacific Ocean, though without &s;ucce&s;s. I &s;hall not therefore trouble my&s;elf to enumerate the advantages that would re&s;ult from this much wi&s;hed-for di&s;covery, its utility being already too well known to the commercial world to need any elucidation; I &s;hall only confine my&s;elf to the methods that appear mo&s;t probable to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s to future adventurers.</P>
<P>The many attempts that have hitherto been made for this purpo&s;e, but which have all been rendered abortive, &s;eem to have turned the &s;pirit of making u&s;eful re&s;earch|es into another channel, and this mo&s;t intere&s;ting one has almo&s;t been given up as impracticable; but, in my opinion, their failure rather proceeds from their being begun at an improper place, than from their imprac|ticability.</P>
<P>All navigators that have hitherto gone in &s;earch of this pa&s;&s;age, have fir&s;t entered Hud&s;on's Bay; the con|&s;equence of which has been, that having &s;pent the &s;ea|&s;on during which only tho&s;e &s;eas are navigable, in exploring many of the numerous inlets lying therein, and this without di&s;covering any opening, terrified at the approach of winter, they have ha&s;tened back for fear of being frozen up, and con&s;equently of being obliged to continue till the return of &s;ummer in tho&s;e bleak and dreary realms. Even &s;uch as have perceived the coa&s;ts to enfold them&s;elves, and who have of cour&s;e entertained hopes of &s;ucceeding, have been deterred from pro&s;ecuting their voyage, le&s;t the winter &s;hould &s;et in before they could reach a more temperate cli|mate.</P>
<P>The&s;e apprehen&s;ions have di&s;couraged the bolde&s;t adventurers from completing the expeditions in which they have engaged, and fru&s;trated every attempt. But as it has been di&s;covered by &s;uch as have &s;ailed into the northern parts of the Pacific Ocean, that there are many inlets which verge towards Hud&s;on's Bay, it is not to be doubted but that a pa&s;&s;age might be made
<PB N="281" REF="021728_0294_0FB5973552741B18">
out from that quarter, if it be &s;ought for at a proper &s;ea&s;on. And &s;hould the&s;e expectations be di&s;appointed, the explorers would not be in the &s;ame hazardous &s;ituati|on with tho&s;e who &s;et out from Hud&s;on's Bay, for they will always be &s;ure of a &s;afe retreat, through an open &s;ea, to warmer regions, even after repeated di&s;appoint|ments. And this confidence will enable them to pro|ceed with greater re&s;olution, and probably be the means of effecting what too much circum&s;pection or timidity has prevented.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons for altering the plan of inquiry after this convenient pa&s;&s;age, carry with them &s;uch convic|tion, that in the year 1774, Richard Whitworth, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> member of parliament for Stafford, a gentleman of an exten&s;ive knowledge in geography, of an active, enterpri&s;ing di&s;po&s;ition, and who&s;e benevolent mind is ever ready to promote the happine&s;s of individuals, or the welfare of the public, from the repre&s;entations made to him of the expediency of it by my&s;elf and others, intended to travel acro&s;s the continent of America, that that he might attempt to carry a &s;cheme of this kind into execution.</P>
