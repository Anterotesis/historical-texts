<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT may perhaps be accounted a bold Di&s;&s;ent from Cu&s;tom, if not a Breach of good Manners, to begin an Epi&s;tle of this Nature without a formal Apology, repre&s;enting my own Inability, my want of Time for Accuracy, or, that I undertook it with great Reluc|tance; and therefore, that all Faults and Imperfections mu&s;t be imputed to tho&s;e who urg'd me, rather than to my &s;elf. But as the&s;e fa&s;hionable <HI>Prologues</HI> (tho' they commonly di&s;cover a greater Penetration and Accuracy than the Pieces them&s;elves, to which they are <HI>annexed</HI>) are &s;eldom much regarded, and perhaps rarely &s;incere; you will excu&s;e me if I ea&s;e you of the Trouble of read|ing One, before you come to the real Matter and De&s;ign of this Letter.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE main End of Speaking and Writing (e&s;peci|ally when any Thing of a religious Nature and Impor|tance is the Subject) &s;hould be, to be thoroughly un|der&s;tood&mdash;And this End (I am bold to affirm) is what I have aim'd at, how far &s;oever I have mi&s;s'd it in what follows.&mdash;I have but one Favour to beg, before I acquaint you with my general De&s;ign; and that is, that you would not look upon it as any de&s;igned Reflection upon your own Genius, Penetration or Learning, that I have carefully avoided tho&s;e labour'd Di&s;tinctions, Critici&s;ms
<PB N="2" REF="007862_0003_102DEA1D11E01490">
and Niceties, which tend to bewilder and confound, rather than in the lea&s;t to in&s;truct, by far the greater Part of Mankind; who are Strangers to &s;chola&s;tick Nice|ties, and the various Methods and Arts of Sophi&s;try; and are often ea&s;ily puzzled and impo&s;ed upon by the mere Charm of Words, which either have no Meaning at all, or the true Sen&s;e of which they never come at.&mdash; What I have principally con&s;ulted is, to di&s;cover Truth; and expre&s;s it in a Manner plain and intelligible, even to the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t vulgar Capacity; the Subject being &s;uch as equally concerns the High and Low, the Wi&s;e and Simple, the Learned and Illiterate, to under&s;tand: &mdash;And &s;hould this End be an&s;wered, I &s;hall be entirely ea&s;y, tho' you and the World &s;hould judge that here is nothing either learned or new&mdash;In a Word, I am far from thinking, and as far from de&s;iring you &s;hould think, that I here pre&s;ent you with any Thing worthy of Prai&s;e and Admiration: An hone&s;t Meaning is the only Commen|dation it pretends to; which will more effectually re|commend it to every hone&s;t Man, than the greate&s;t Ap|pearance of Learning and Penetration, without this.&mdash; Not doubting therefore but that I am writing to a Gen|tleman highly de&s;erving of this Character, to one who with an hone&s;t Heart &s;eeks to know the Truth as it is in JESUS; and is not knowingly and willingly under the Influence of any Prejudice or partial Inclination; I pro|ceed without further Ceremony to acquaint you, That I have with the utmo&s;t Application, Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Candor I am capable of, read and con&s;idered, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Emlyn</HI>'s <HI>Inquiry into the Scripture Account of</HI> JESUS CHRIST; which you have been plea&s;ed to dedicate, <HI>To the</HI> Reverend the Clergy <HI>of all Denominations in</HI> New-Eng|land.&mdash; I forbear all Remarks upon your Dedication, and the grand Motive which induc'd you to procure a New-Impre&s;&s;ion of this Inquiry in <HI>New-England,</HI> 'till I have laid before you my Ob&s;ervations upon the Inquiry it&s;elf,

which I &s;hall confine to as &s;mall a Compa&s;s as I po&s;&s;ibly can; and be &s;o particular as to omit nothing of your Author's Rea&s;onings that can be tho't to have any Weight in it; and then perhaps &s;uch Remarks will appear more ju&s;t and rea&s;onable than they might do here.</P>
<P>I BEGIN with your Author's fir&s;t Chapter, where he propo&s;es two Things in order to maintain the Subordina|tion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or his Inequality to God the Father.</P>
<P N="1">I. "THAT the Term <HI>God</HI> is u&s;ed in Scripture in dif|ferent "Sen&s;es, <HI>&s;upreme</HI> and <HI>&s;ubordinate.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <Q>THAT our Lord Je&s;us &s;peaks of <HI>another</HI> as God, <HI>di&s;tinct from him&s;elf,</HI> and owns this God to be <HI>above or ever him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>UPON the Fir&s;t of the&s;e I would only ob&s;erve, what I &s;uppo&s;e your Author intends by it; which is, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t may be called a God in Scripture, and yet not be the &s;upreme God: A Point never yet denied by any who have read the Scriptures.&mdash;But it is inquired, whether <HI>Je&s;us Christ</HI> is not &s;tiled <HI>God</HI> in &s;uch a Manner, and un|der &s;uch Circum&s;tances, as plainly denote him to be <HI>God &s;upreme?</HI> He is in Scripture &s;tiled, The <HI>Mighty God,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;ai.</HI> ix. 6.</NOTE>&mdash; <HI>Emmanuel,</HI> which being interpreted is, <HI>God with us.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>chap.</HI> vii. 14. <HI>Matth.</HI> i. 23.</NOTE>&mdash;It is affirmed by St. <HI>John,</HI> that the <HI>Word,</HI> i. e. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>was God.</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> i. 1.</NOTE>&mdash;And the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>God was manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h,</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 16.</NOTE> meaning Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, He <HI>is over all, God ble&s;&s;ed for evermore.</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> ix. 5.</NOTE>&mdash;And St. <HI>John,</HI> that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the <HI>true God</HI> and <HI>eternal Life,</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>John</HI> v. 20.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash; Now it is inquir'd, Whether Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not here &s;tiled <HI>God</HI> in &s;uch a Manner, and under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, as plainly denote him to be God &s;upreme?&mdash;Your Author allows him to be <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Lords</HI> (indefinitely) but ima|gines, <HI>that</HI> notes an inferior Character, compar'd with that of <HI>God of Gods</HI>&mdash;and refers us to 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.5. for a
<PB N="4" REF="007862_0005_102DEA20D44F5F10">
Proof of it:&mdash;But how it appears from hence that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not God, I mu&s;t confe&s;s is more than I can &s;ee; &s;ince we may with equal Propriety thence infer, that the one God is no Lord, as that the one Lord is not God.&mdash; If it be &s;aid that the Term <HI>God</HI> implies <HI>Lord</HI> al&s;o, but not the contrary; I an&s;wer, it by no means follows that Lord of Lords, does not imply God al&s;o, but that it does; &s;ince God is a <HI>Lord of Lords,</HI> i. e. Lord of all Lords, in|definitely, mu&s;t therefore be God of all Gods; and if there be no Lord above Him, there is no God above Him, &s;ince every God is a Lord.&mdash;And in this Light the Words of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> which your Author refers to, appear again&s;t him, (if fairly cited.) That great Man defines <HI>God</HI> from his Dominion; and ob&s;erves, that con&s;ider'd as the Object of our Wor&s;hip, he is a Lord in the mo&s;t eminent Sen&s;e; and therefore &s;hould rather be defined from his Dominion than from his Perfections.&mdash;Whenever then we &s;peak of God we con&s;ider him as Lord al&s;o.&mdash;Lord of Lords in|definitely mu&s;t therefore imply God.&mdash;Though every Lord is not God, yet the Lord of Lords is God; <HI>this</HI> implies the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Dominion; and if, according to Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> we are to define God from his Dominion, what more conci&s;e and proper Definition can be given of Him than that of Lord of Lords?&mdash;If God is to be de|fined from his Dominion, what more noble or ju&s;t De&s;crip|tion can be given of Him than the Apo&s;tle gives of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that <HI>he is the ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate;</HI> the <HI>King of Kings,</HI> and <HI>Lord of Lords,</HI> &amp;c.? I might add, that Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> was of Opinion, that from true Dominion, it follows that God is living, intelligent and powerful; and therefore as the Apo&s;tle attributes the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Dominion to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o we may thence infer that he is living, intelligent and powerful in the mo&s;t emi|nent Sen&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> that he is God of Gods, or God &s;u|preme: &mdash;But perhaps &s;ome Men will rather chu&s;e to con&s;ider Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> when he talks at this rate, as a

<HI>Philo&s;opher</HI> than a <HI>Divine;</HI> for were this allowed it would be of it&s;elf a compleat An&s;wer to your Author as he final|ly &s;tates the Que&s;tion, <Q>Has Je&s;us Chri&s;t any God over him, who has greater Authority and greater Ability than him&s;elf or not?</Q> certainly <HI>not;</HI> for the Apo&s;tle evidently attributes the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Authority or Dominion to him; he &s;tiles him the <HI>only Potentate</HI>&mdash;the <HI>Lord of Lords;</HI> and Power or Ability (according to Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>) follow from true Dominion: None therefore has greater Ability than <HI>he, who</HI> has the greate&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive Dominion.</P>
<P>BUT not to pur&s;ue this too far&mdash;I proceed to ob&s;erve upon Sect. II.&mdash;Your Author having &s;tated the Que&s;tion, <Q>Has Je&s;us Chri&s;t any God over him, who has greater Authority and greater Ability than him&s;elf or not?</Q>
propo&s;es hence to demon&s;trate the Affirmative, by &s;hew|ing, Fir&s;t, that <Q>Je&s;us Chri&s;t expre&s;ly &s;peaks of <HI>another God</HI> than him&s;elf.</Q>&mdash;Secondly, That <Q>he acknowledges this God to be <HI>above or over him&s;elf;</HI></Q>&mdash;And la&s;tly, That <Q>he wants tho&s;e &s;upereminent and infinite Perfec|tions which belong only to the Lord God of Gods.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>FOR the fir&s;t of the&s;e, he refers us to <HI>Mat.</HI> 27.46, where our Saviour cry'd out upon the Cro&s;s, <HI>My God, my God, &amp;c.;</HI> and to <HI>John</HI> 20.17, where after his Re|&s;urrection he &s;ent to his Di&s;ciples, (by the Women who fir&s;t &s;aw him,) &s;aying, <HI>I a&s;cend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God</HI>&mdash;Here I would ob&s;erve, That tho&s;e who oppo&s;e your Author, con&s;ider Je&s;us Chri&s;t as Man when thus praying to and &s;peaking of God; that tho' the divine and humane Natures were u|nited in his Per&s;on, yet that the humane only pray'd and complain'd to God, &amp;c. and therefore that &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages are no Evidence that he is not truly God &s;upreme.&mdash;And it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd that if there be any ju&s;t Grounds for &s;uch an Interpretation, it entirely de&s;troys the Force of &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages to prove any thing in Favour of your Au|thor's
<PB N="6" REF="007862_0007_102DEA25907BC9A0">
Opinion:&mdash;And the plain intelligible Rea&s;on to be a&s;&s;ign'd for this Interpretation is, that he is frequently &s;tiled God in &s;uch a Manner, and under &s;uch Circum&s;tan|ces, and &s;uch Things are predicated of him, and attribu|ted to him, as more plainly denote him to be the <HI>&s;upreme God,</HI> than the Texts your Author refers to denote the <HI>contrary.</HI> Some of the&s;e I have already mentioned, as, that he is &s;tiled <HI>the mighty God, Emmanuel, God ble&s;&s;ed forevermore, the true God,</HI> &amp;c. without any Limitation or Re&s;triction, and in like Manner infinite, unlimited Knowledge is attributed to him:<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xxi. 17.</NOTE>&mdash;And the Knowledge of Men's Hearts:<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> ii. 23.</NOTE>&mdash;And he tells us, That he is <HI>Alpha and Omega; the beginning and the ending;</HI>&mdash;HE, <HI>which is, which was, and which is to come; the Almighty</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>chap.</HI> i. 8.</NOTE>&mdash;that <HI>He and the Father are One</HI>&mdash;that <HI>what things &s;oever the Fa|ther doth, tho&s;e doth the Son likewi&s;e</HI>&mdash;that <HI>as the Father rai&s;eth up the Dead and quickneth them, even &s;o the Son quickeneth whom he will.</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">John <HI>v. 19.</HI> and onward.</NOTE> &mdash; And many other things are predicated of him, which can belong only to God almigh|ty:&mdash;Not only Men, but Angels, are commanded to <HI>wor&s;hip him:</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> i. 6.</NOTE>&mdash;And his Dominion and Authority are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed forever,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>chap.</HI> i. 8. &amp;c.</NOTE> &amp;c. Now we mu&s;t either &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Repre&s;entations and De&s;criptions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be fal&s;e and groundle&s;s; or that tho&s;e Texts which (if literally under&s;tood of his Per&s;on) repre&s;ent him inferior to God, are to be interpreted in the Manner mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> of his human Nature only, and not of his Per&s;on, which is di|vine: &mdash; For it is agreed on all Sides, that tho&s;e Texts (which if literally under&s;tood of his Per&s;on) repre&s;ent Je|&s;us Chri&s;t as God, and tho&s;e which repre&s;ent him as in|ferior to God, equally belong to the Canon of holy Scrip|ture&mdash;The Que&s;tion is, Which we are to under&s;tand in their literal and mo&s;t obvious Sen&s;e; tho&s;e which repre|&s;ent him as God and equal to the Father, or tho&s;e which
<PB N="7" REF="007862_0008_102DEA275AC3BEE0">
repre&s;ent him as &s;ubordinate and inferior? for both the&s;e cannot be under&s;tood literally, or of his Per&s;on:&mdash;But ei|ther tho&s;e which repre&s;ent him as inferior to God, mu&s;t be under&s;tood of his human Nature only, or tho&s;e which re|pre&s;ent him as God, mu&s;t be under&s;tood of his Office.&mdash; The former of the&s;e I humbly think the mo&s;t rea&s;onable, <HI>viz.</HI> that tho&s;e Texts which repre&s;ent Je&s;us Chri&s;t as in|ferior to God, are to be under&s;tood of his human Nature only, and not of his Per&s;on, which is divine; and that tho&s;e which repre&s;ent him as God, are to be literally un|der&s;tood of his Per&s;on, that he is <HI>the true God, God ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> &amp;c. My Rea&s;ons for which are the&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1^s^t THAT there is no Propriety in de&s;cribing Chri&s;t as to his Office by calling him <HI>God,</HI> according to the com|mon and ordinary u&s;e of that <HI>Term</HI> in Scripture, and the general Acceptation of <HI>it</HI> among Men. The Term <HI>God</HI> is u&s;ed and generally under&s;tood to denote that infinite, eternal, &s;elf-exi&s;tent Being who created and pre&s;erves all Things; and if, with Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> we define God from his Dominion, &s;till the Term (when accompanied by no Re&s;triction or Limitation) denotes one that has true, univer&s;al, underived and everla&s;ting Dominion; &s;uch as is attributed to Chri&s;t, <HI>Thy Throne, O God, is forever:</HI> And which can belong only to God &s;upreme&mdash;So that it amounts to ju&s;t the &s;ame, whether we define God from his Perfections or from his Dominion; &s;till its a very improper and uncommon U&s;e of Language to de&s;cribe Je&s;us Chri&s;t as to his Office by the Term God, without any Re&s;triction or Limitation; and much more &s;o &s;till to de&s;cribe him as to his Office, by attributing that to him which belongs only to the &s;upreme God. But</P>
<P N="2">2^d^l^y THERE is not the lea&s;t Intimation where Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;tiled God, either in the Texts them&s;elves, or in what preceeds or follows, that <HI>this</HI> is to be under&s;tood of his Office, and not of his Per&s;on.&mdash;Where Magi&s;trates are &s;tiled Gods, the very next Words explain it, and tell us
<PB N="8" REF="007862_0009_102DEA29EEC90530">
what we are to under&s;tand by <HI>it:</HI> And in like manner, where <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Angels</HI> are called Gods, no one, who at|tends to the whole Di&s;cour&s;e, could ea&s;ily mi&s;take the Meaning, or not &s;ee that the Term God was there u&s;ed in an inferior and metaphorical Sen&s;e. But there is no Foundation for this where Chri&s;t is &s;tiled <HI>the true God&mdash; God ble&s;&s;ed forevermore &mdash; God who&s;e Throne is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed forever,</HI> &amp;c. Here is no Room to &s;u&s;pect that the Term God is u&s;ed in an uncommon or improper Sen&s;e, or that it denotes any other than that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is actu|ally that true God, God ble&s;&s;ed, &amp;c. he is &s;aid to be. Much le&s;s is there Room for any &s;uch Con&s;truction where <HI>that</HI> is attributed to Chri&s;t <HI>which</HI> belongs to the &s;upreme God alone: I mean infinite Knowledge, eternal Self-ex|i&s;tence, religious Wor&s;hip and Homage, &amp;c. which I &s;hall &s;hew to be di&s;tinctly attributed to him, in another Place.&mdash;</P>
<P>I proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3">3^d^l^y That from what has been &s;aid, it appears there is the utmo&s;t Danger, that &s;uch De&s;criptions (if they are to be under&s;tood of the Office of Chri&s;t only) will give Men wrong Conceptions of him: They naturally lead us to look upon him as the <HI>true God,</HI> and to adore and wor&s;hip him as &s;uch.&mdash;And &s;urely that God who is jealous of his own Honour, and will not give his Glory to another, i. e. will &s;uffer none to receive the Homage and Wor&s;hip which is due to him, nor give his Creatures any ju&s;t Oc|ca&s;ion to look upon any other as God be&s;ides him&s;elf; HE, I &s;ay, would never have repre&s;ented Je&s;us Chri&s;t as God, if he was not truly &s;uch: He never would have laid &s;uch a Snare for us, &s;uch a Temptation before us, to e&s;teem and honour one as God, who is no God.&mdash;If it be &s;aid, That this Plea holds equally good on the other &s;ide of the Que&s;tion, and that there is as great Danger of our contracting too low an Opinion of the Lord Je&s;us (if he is truly God) from tho&s;e Scriptures which repre&s;ent
<PB N="9" REF="007862_0010_102DEA2C0CCA3B20">
him inferior to God, as the contrary. I an&s;wer, That the manife&s;t Danger of Deception here is by no means equal;</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> BECAUSE the De&s;ign of our Saviour's coming into the World, and the Miracles which he wrought while manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h, were &s;uch as naturally tended to give Mankind (I mean &s;uch as believ'd him to be the Chri&s;t) high and adoring Thoughts of him, and &s;uch as would lead them to Reverence and Wor&s;hip him as God, and to give that Honour and Glory to him which is due to God alone; and indeed this Di&s;po&s;ition appear'd in tho&s;e who knew Je&s;us to be the Chri&s;t as &s;oon as he was born.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> ii. 11.</NOTE>&mdash;And while he was manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h he fre|quently receiv'd Wor&s;hip and Homage from tho&s;e who were convinced that he was the Chri&s;t&mdash;From the Wo|man of <HI>Samaria,</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iv.</NOTE> from the Leper,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> viii. 2.</NOTE> from a certain Ruler, who was a God by Office,<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chap. ix. 18.</NOTE> from the whole Ship's Crew,<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chap. xiv. 33.</NOTE>
&amp;c.&mdash;Tho&s;e who &s;aw his Miracles, and believed on him as the Chri&s;t, were ever di&s;po&s;ed to wor&s;hip, reverence and exalt him. If it be &s;aid, that they wor&s;hiped him be|cau&s;e they thought him more than a mere Man, even a God&mdash;this will favour the Interpretation I maintain, that he is truly God; &s;ince he never forbid them or told them to wor&s;hip God and not him; that he was their fellow-Servant, and the like; as the Apo&s;tles con&s;tantly did, when &s;uch Wor&s;hip was offered to them<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> x. 26, <HI>and</HI> xiv. 15.</NOTE>: This I think truly ob&s;ervable, that our Lord Je&s;us never in the le&s;t &s;uppre&s;s'd or di&s;couraged this Di&s;po&s;ition in People to reverence and wor&s;hip him: And if he is not God &s;upreme, it is to me &s;omething unaccountable; &s;ince I have ever thought Him to be the only proper Object of religious Wor&s;hip; and that to attribute it to any Creature was Bla&s;phemy, a rob|bing God of his Honor.&mdash;But if it &s;hould be &s;aid, that this was not properly religious Wor&s;hip (which I &s;hall here|after &s;hew in other In&s;tances is plainly attributed to Chri&s;t)

but a Reverence and Re&s;pect they paid him as a &s;uperior dignified Creature; yet this is &s;ufficient for my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, to &s;hew that tho&s;e who believ'd him to be the Chri&s;t, knew the De&s;ign of his Coming, and &s;aw his Mi|racles, had very high and adoring Thoughts of him; which led them to pay him, at lea&s;t, the greate&s;t Reve|rence and Re&s;pect that can be due to a mere Creature: This your Author ob&s;erves Pag. 52. (tho' with a different De&s;ign) is the Ca&s;e with Mankind &s;ince the Apo&s;tle's Days, and the &s;hutting up of Prophe&s;y: Tho&s;e who e&s;teem Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the Saviour of Sinners, are di&s;po&s;ed to think and &s;peak very highly of him; and con&s;equently will much more readily embrace, and ea&s;ily believe, the De&s;cription which repre&s;ents Him as <HI>the true God, God ble&s;&s;ed forever,</HI> &amp;c. than that which repre&s;ents him as a mere Man, inferior and &s;ubordinate to God, provided the&s;e De&s;criptions are founded upon equal Authority, as is the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e:&mdash;So that for this Rea&s;on 'tis plain there is greater Danger of our being deceived by tho&s;e Texts which repre&s;ent Chri&s;t as the true God, &amp;c, if he is not God; than by tho&s;e which repre&s;ent him as inferior to God, if he is God: This is on Suppo&s;ition that he is as expre&s;sly, as clearly, and in as unlimited a Manner re|pre&s;ented to be inferior to God, by one Part of &s;acred Writ, as he is to be God by another Part; which I hum|bly think is not the Ca&s;e; for</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To put the two De&s;criptions or Repre&s;enta|tions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t upon an exact parallel, the Que&s;tion mu&s;t be, Whether he is God or Man? But this is not the Que&s;tion in debate; it being agreed on both Sides, that he is truly Man; at lea&s;t, that he was &s;o far a Man when manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h, as to be &s;ubject to all our common Wants, Pains and &s;inle&s;s Infirmities: &mdash; But the Que&s;tion which ari&s;es is, Whether he was a mere Man, or God-man? Whether he was a mere human Per&s;on? or, Whether the divine and human Natures were both united in his
<PB N="11" REF="007862_0012_102DEA30071556D8">
Per&s;on? and, Whether he is more plainly repre&s;ented in Scripture as God-Man than as a mere Man? And in this View of the Que&s;tion, I think there is &s;carce Room to doubt but that De&s;cription of Chri&s;t, which repre&s;ents him as God, is mo&s;t obvious and clear, and has va&s;tly the Ad|vantage of the <HI>other,</HI> which repre&s;ents him as Man and inferior to God: This will appear plain if we con&s;ider that tho&s;e Texts which repre&s;ent him as Man, and inferior to God, may be literally under&s;tood of his Manhood, or human Nature, and not contradict tho&s;e which repre&s;ent him as God: But the contrary will not hold true, that tho&s;e which repre&s;ent him as God, may be literally under|&s;tood, if we under&s;tand the other of his whole Per&s;on: And it's an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Maxim, never to put a figurative Interpretation upon Scripture, where the mo&s;t obvious literal Interpretation is true and con&s;i&s;tent; and if this be true, if this be the &s;ure&s;t and mo&s;t natural Way of inter|preting Scripture, it follows that we &s;hould under&s;tand tho&s;e Texts, which repre&s;ent Chri&s;t as the true God, li|terally of his Per&s;on; and tho&s;e which repre&s;ent him as Man and inferior to God, literally of his human Nature, or Manhood only. Upon the whole then; I think it ap|pears that was a Man, de&s;titute of all Prejudice and Pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, who e&s;teemed Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the Saviour of lo&s;t Sinners, to read the Bible, and con&s;ider tho&s;e Scriptures which repre&s;ent him to be truly God, and tho&s;e which your Author thinks repre&s;ent him as inferior to God; he would be mo&s;t likely to under&s;tand the former literally of his Per&s;on, and the other of his human Nature only; and con&s;equently the Danger of Deception from tho&s;e Texts, which repre&s;ent Je&s;us Chri&s;t as God, is greater, if he be not God, than the contrary: We mu&s;t therefore, to vindicate the Goodne&s;s of that God of Truth, by who&s;e In&s;piration the Scriptures were given, in not laying a Snare for us, or a Temptation before us, to give that Ho|nour and Wor&s;hip to another which is due to Him&s;elf a|lone;

I &s;ay, in order to this, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is truly God, and that it's <HI>his</HI> holy Will that all Men &s;hould honour the Son even as they honour the Fa|ther: He gave us the Scriptures to profit us, and not to puzzle, en&s;nare and confound us:&mdash;They are for <HI>Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;|ne&s;s; that the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good Works,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16, 17, &mdash; and not for Riddles, for Deceptions, or Sophi&s;ms, that the Man of Sin may be furni&s;hed with Ways and Methods to evade the Truth, and maintain Fal&s;ehood and Unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s. We mu&s;t therefore, if we con&s;ult the Nature and De&s;ign of the Scriptures, conclude, that the mo&s;t ob|vious and literal Interpretation, when con&s;i&s;tent with Rea|&s;on and common Sen&s;e, and the Scriptures in general, is to be preferr'd to any forced or figurative one whate|ver: And if &s;o, then the Interpretation which we put up|on tho&s;e Scriptures, which repre&s;ent Chri&s;t as inferior to God, <HI>viz.</HI> that they are to be under&s;tood of his Manhood, or human Nature only, is to be preferred to your Author's Interpretation, which &s;uppo&s;es the mo&s;t explicit, unlimit|ed A&s;&s;ertions of the &s;upreme Deity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Equality to God, even the Father, are to be under|&s;tood of his Office, and not of his Per&s;on: That he is <HI>the mighty God, the true God, God ble&s;&s;ed forevermore, God, who&s;e Throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed forever,</HI> by Office only; that Men and Angels are commanded to wor&s;hip him; that eternal Exi&s;tence, infinite Knowledge, immen&s;e Pre|&s;ence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are attributed to him, only on Account of his Office, and not for any per&s;onal inherent Perfections he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of e&s;&s;entially and independently. Your Au|thor indeed attempts very largely to &s;hew the Ab&s;urdity of this Interpretation; and that there is no &s;uch Founda|tion for it as I here &s;uppo&s;e; and his Rea&s;oning upon this Head I &s;hall di&s;tinctly con&s;ider:&mdash;I would only ob&s;erve, at pre&s;ent, that in Ca&s;e I &s;hew the Vanity and Sophi&s;try

Method of interpreting this Text.&mdash; I think all mu&s;t al|low that the Truth of his Interpretation entirely depends upon the Opinion which the young Man had of Chri&s;t, who received this An&s;wer from him. &mdash; And this I am ready to think very difficult exactly to determine: How|ever there is evidently the greate&s;t Probability, that he did not look upon him to be God: And if &s;o, then the An&s;wer he received from Chri&s;t, may be very fairly under|&s;tood as a Check or Reproof upon him, for attributing that to Chri&s;t, while he thought him a mere Man, which belongs to God only; &mdash; for <HI>as a Man thinketh in his Heart, &s;o is he;</HI>&mdash; and therefore the young Man was re|proveable for attributing that to him, which belonged not to him in the Character or Capacity he viewed him in; tho' it ju&s;tly belonged to him in his real per&s;onal Cha|racter: &mdash;This is undeniable.&mdash;And now I humbly think, it mo&s;t probable, that the young Man did not look up|on our Saviour to be God,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e the prevailing Opinion among the <HI>Pha|ri&s;ees</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> in general at that Day, concerning the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was, not that he &s;hould be <HI>God manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h,</HI> but a mere Son of <HI>David,</HI> a temporal Prince and Saviour; and if the young Man tho't him to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> yet that his Opinion of him, was agreeable to the common <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> Notion of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> is altogether probable; &s;ince he was one from among the Multitude; and there is not the lea&s;t Intimation that he thought dif|ferently of Chri&s;t, from what the Re&s;t tho't of the <HI>Me|&s;&s;iah</HI> in general. Nothing can be infer'd concerning his Opinion of him, from the Que&s;tion he a&s;ks him, more than this, That he thought him, as <HI>Nicodemus</HI> did, <HI>A Teacher come from God;</HI> or one able to in&s;truct him.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> WHAT very much confirms it, that he did not take our Saviour to be God, is his Conduct after he had received In&s;tructions from him, &mdash; <HI>He went away

&s;orrowful.</HI>&mdash;What!

Or, would a Man thus believingly taught from God's own Mouth, go away &s;orrowful, that he mu&s;t deny him&s;elf one Thing to plea&s;e this God? No verily; a Man that would act at this Rate, mu&s;t be a|bandoned to the greate&s;t Degree of Hardne&s;s and Stupi|dity: But the Character of this young Man is very dif|ferently repre&s;ented: He <HI>had kept,</HI> at lea&s;t externally, the <HI>&s;econd Table</HI> of the moral Law <HI>from his Youth;</HI> was inqui&s;itive <HI>what he &s;hould do to be &s;aved;</HI> yea, he was a Youth of &s;o much Innocence and Vertue, that our Saviour <HI>loved him:</HI> In &s;hort, He <HI>lacked but one Thing</HI> to make him a good and perfect Man in the Sen&s;e of Scripture; and &s;urely he would not have lacked this one Thing, had he verily believed the great God from his own Mouth recommended it to him.</P>

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> IF our Saviour knew the young Man tho't him to be God, and was con&s;cious to him&s;elf at the &s;ame Time that he was not God, (as your Author &s;uppo&s;es) I &s;ay, if this be the Ca&s;e, it's difficult to a&s;&s;ign a Rea&s;on for his an&s;wering him in this Manner; <HI>Why do&s;t thou call me good? there is none good but One, that is God.</HI>&mdash; This implies only an Inquiry why he called him Good; <HI>i. e.</HI> upon what Account; and not a Denial that he was Good: He affirms that <HI>none is good but God;</HI> but this is not denying him&s;elf to be God.&mdash; Had he de&s;igned &s;uch a Thing, if his Manner of Expre&s;&s;ion is not alto|gether unintelligible, it's evidently very liable to be mi&s;|under&s;tood, and but little favours &s;uch a De&s;ign.&mdash; Had he de&s;ign'd to have cured the young Man of a Mi&s;take,
<PB N="20" REF="007862_0021_102DEA44A8538838">
in thinking him God when he was not, would he not rather have plainly told him, I am not God; or you are wrong in calling me Good?&mdash; But on the other Side, It is ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign a Rea&s;on why our Saviour did not more fully declare his God-head to this young Man.&mdash; The captious de&s;igning Phari&s;ees were about him, &s;eek|ing Occa&s;ion and Opportunity to accu&s;e him; but as <HI>His Time was not yet come,</HI> he was careful to give them none, that their Ignorance, Ill-nature and Prejudice could po&s;&s;ibly improve again&s;t him at that Time. But what Improvement they would have made of it, had he a&s;&s;erted him&s;elf to be God, we may learn from the Account given of his Accu&s;ation and Tryal, <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. and <HI>Luke</HI> 22. When he intimated before the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> that he was <HI>the Son of God,</HI> the general Cry was, <HI>What need we any further Witne&s;&s;es? for we our &s;elves have heard of his own Mouth.</HI> And, John 5.18. <HI>The Jews &s;ought the more to kill him, becau&s;e he &s;aid, that God was his Father; making him&s;elf equal with God,</HI> as they interpreted it: And our Saviour is &s;o far from denying ab&s;olutely that their Interpretation was right, that he im|mediately a&s;&s;erts his Onene&s;s with the Father; tho' in &s;uch a Manner as to prevent their making an immediate Improvement of it again&s;t him:&mdash;He &s;ays, <HI>What Things &s;oever the Father doth, the&s;e al&s;o doth the Son likewi&s;e.</HI> From hence it appears, that our Saviour carefully avoided &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as that even the Phari&s;ees them&s;elves could judge &s;ufficient to accu&s;e and condemn him by, till his Time or Hour was come; and therefore thought not proper to a&s;&s;ert his Divinity, or God-head, in plain, ex|plicit Terms to the World; not even till <HI>He was decla|red to be the Son of God with Power, by a Re&s;urrection from the Dead.</HI> &mdash; And this, if I mi&s;take not, lets us into the Foundation and De&s;ign of that Charge our Sa|viour gave his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Matth,</HI> 16.16. and <HI>Luke</HI> 9.22. When <HI>Peter,</HI> (&s;peaking the Sentiments of the other Di&s;|ciples,)
<PB N="21" REF="007862_0022_102DEA465AB6CE60">
declared him to be <HI>Chri&s;t the Son of God;</HI> i. e. God by <HI>Nature,</HI> and not merely by <HI>Office</HI> and <HI>Delegation:</HI> He &s;trictly charged and commanded them, that <HI>they &s;hould tell no Man</HI> that <HI>Thing:</HI> But why? What is the Rea&s;on of this Charge? HE adds, <HI>Becau&s;e the Son of Man,</HI> (not the Son of God mo&s;t properly and by Way of Eminence &s;o called,) <HI>mu&s;t &s;uffer many Things, and be re|jected of the Elders and chief Prie&s;ts and Scribes:</HI>&mdash;Intend|ing certainly, that it was incon&s;i&s;tent with the Purpo&s;es of infinite Wi&s;dom, and his then pre&s;ent State of Humilia|tion and approaching Sufferings, that HE &s;hould be pub|lickly preached and proclaimed to be <HI>what He really was,</HI> and what his own Di&s;ciples <HI>thought Him to be:</HI> &mdash; And no wonder; when he gave his Di&s;ciples &s;uch a Charge not to proclaim the <HI>Dignity of his Per&s;on,</HI> and his <HI>real Character,</HI> till after his Sufferings, that he &s;hould de|cline doing it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then; From what has been &s;aid, it appears (if not very plain yet) mo&s;t probable, that the young Man did not look upon <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to be <HI>God:</HI> &mdash; That our Saviour's An&s;wer, <HI>Why do&s;t thou call me Good?</HI> &amp;c, is to be under&s;tood as a Check, or Reproof, upon the young Man, not for his Words &s;imply con&s;idered; but for his applying them to Chri&s;t, while he entertained his then pre&s;ent Opinion of him: I &s;ay, that his An&s;wer is to be under&s;tood in <HI>this</HI> Light; and not as a Denial of his own Goodne&s;s or Deity, &s;ince the Words do not plainly expre&s;s any &s;uch Denial: And no Rea&s;on can be offered why our Saviour &s;hould not plainly expre&s;s it, if this was his De&s;ign: But on the other Hand, that there is good Rea&s;on why he did not ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ert and publickly declare his Divinity <HI>at that Time;</HI> &s;uch a Declaration be|ing incon&s;i&s;tent with the Purpo&s;es of infinite Wi&s;dom, the State of Humiliation he was in, and the Scene of Suffer|ings he had to pa&s;s thro'. &mdash; So that if we are to judge according to the greate&s;t Degree of Evidence and pro|bable
<PB N="22" REF="007862_0023_102DEA48A2672100">
Te&s;timony, we mu&s;t judge that there is no &s;uffi|cient Ground for your Author's Interpretation of our Saviour's An&s;wer to the young Man. &mdash;</P>
<P>I proceed to the</P>
<P N="3">3^d and la&s;t <HI>In&s;tance,</HI> wherein your Author &s;uppo&s;es our Lord di&s;claimed a Perfection which belongs to the <HI>&s;u|preme God,</HI> viz. Mark 13.32. <HI>Of that Day knows no Man; no, not the Angels of Heaven; nor the Son; but the Father.</HI> &mdash; This I look upon to be the mo&s;t plau|&s;ible Argument in favour of your Author's Opinion. As to <HI>the other</HI> In&s;tances he produces, if we con&s;ider their obvious Circum&s;tances, and the general Current of Scrip|ture, they are no Ways to his Purpo&s;e;&mdash; and even <HI>this</HI> is fairly over-balanced by other Scriptures, which affirm in the mo&s;t po&s;itive, unlimited Manner, that <HI>He knows</HI> all <HI>Things;</HI>&mdash;that <HI>He &s;earcheth the Reins and the Hearts,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash; For this is not a po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertion that he did not, per&s;onally con&s;idered, <HI>know the Day and Hour;</HI> &mdash; but, <HI>of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man; no not the Angels; nor the Son,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Son of Man,</HI> or the <HI>human Nature:</HI> He did not then know it, con&s;idered as the Pro|phet and Teacher of Mankind: It was what he could not then reveal in this Character; it being kept as an invio|ble Secret from all created Beings; what no ways con|cerned them to know; yea, the Knowledge of which would be dangerous and hurtful, for the Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned: For this bring kept &s;uch a Secret is, that <HI>All</HI> might <HI>Watch:</HI> A Duty that would in a great Mea&s;ure be &s;uper&s;eded by a Revelation of that Day and Hour: Therefore, <HI>of that Day and Hour</HI> mu&s;t <HI>no Man know; no, not the Angels; &mdash; nor the Son,</HI> con&s;idered as Man; or the Prophet and Teacher of Mankind: This I think a plain and natural Solution of the&s;e Words, in con&s;ideration of the Circum|&s;tances attending them, and tho&s;e other Scriptures, which po&s;itively affirm, that our Lord Je&s;us <HI>knows All Things;</HI> that <HI>He &s;earcheth the Heart,</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; That they are to be

under&s;tood of Him con&s;idered as <HI>Man,</HI> or the Prophet and Teacher of Mankind, and not Per&s;onally. &mdash; I have therefore nothing to do now in order to maintain my Cau&s;e, but to remove your Author's Objections again&s;t this Interpretation, and the Arguments I have brought to &s;upport it. And this I &s;hall attempt to do in a brief and familiar Manner, tho' your Author has dwelt very largely upon it; con&s;cious, that his whole Hypothe&s;is was depending, and mu&s;t inevitably fall if he failed in this Point.</P>
<P>HE therefore obejects;</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 1^s^t, <Q>THAT our ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us, if him&s;elf was the &s;upreme God in any Nature of his own, could not have &s;aid &s;uch Things in any Con&s;i&s;tency with Truth and Sincerity:&mdash;He could not &s;ay <HI>Him&s;elf could not do,</HI> and <HI>did not know,</HI> the Things, which, if he were God &s;upreme, he <HI>could do,</HI> and <HI>did know,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
&mdash; As to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> "Our Saviour's &s;ay|ing, that <HI>He could do nothing of him&s;elf,</HI>" I have already &s;hewn it evident from the Context, that it's to be under|&s;tood of his <HI>Will;</HI> that he had no private Will of his own, &s;eparate from the Father's; and not of his <HI>Power:</HI> For, <HI>What Things &s;oever the Father doth, tho&s;e doth the Son;</HI> and, <HI>as the Father quickeneth whom He will, &s;o doth the Son.</HI>&mdash; And, as to the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> He does not po&s;itively deny his <HI>knowing the Day,</HI> &amp;c, <HI>Per&s;onally</HI> con|&s;idered; but con&s;idered <HI>as Man;</HI> or in the Character of our Prophet and Teacher.&mdash; So that the Que&s;tion is plainly this, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether our Lord Je&s;us, if the divine and human Natures were united in his Per&s;on, could not affirm, that he did not know <HI>that</HI> as <HI>Man,</HI> or con&s;idered as our Teacher, <HI>which</HI> he did know, as GOD, con|&s;i&s;tent with Truth; and this, without any expre&s;s Li|mitation or Re&s;erve?&mdash; In order to determine <HI>this;</HI> the Time, Manner and Circum&s;tances of his &s;peaking, mu&s;t be con&s;idered: For it mu&s;t be allowed, That at one Time,
<PB N="24" REF="007862_0025_102DEA4CD96812F8">
and under certain Circum&s;tances, a Re&s;erve or Limi|tation may be nece&s;&s;ary to render a Speech con&s;i&s;tent with Truth; when at another Time, and under dif|ferent Circum&s;tances, the &s;ame Speech may be equally true, without any &s;uch Re&s;erve or Limitation's being expre&s;&s;ed. &mdash; This might be illu&s;trated, were it nece&s;|&s;ary, by various Examples. &mdash; The Truth and Con|&s;i&s;tency of a particular Speech or Sentence often depends upon the Circum&s;tances of the Time; the Knowledge of the Hearers; or the preceeding or following Di&s;cour&s;e of the Speaker: For it's no Argument, that a Man &s;peaks incon&s;i&s;tent with Truth, becau&s;e we mi&s;under&s;tand him; or becau&s;e what he &s;ays is not true in the Light we con|&s;ider it: If &s;o, every Man mu&s;t be a Liar that has the Misfortune to be mi&s;under&s;tood; and at this Rate, per|haps, &s;ome would make our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour as great a Liar as the Father of Lies him&s;elf. &mdash; Now to ap|ply this to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e in the mo&s;t familiar Manner: &mdash; If the Di&s;ciples under&s;tood him to &s;peak of his <HI>hu|man Nature,</HI> or of him&s;elf con&s;idered as the Prophet and Teacher of Mankind, and <HI>not</HI> of him&s;elf <HI>per&s;onally,</HI> when he &s;aid, that <HI>the Son did not know the Day and the Hour;</HI> then with regard to them, his Speech or Saying was con|&s;i&s;tent with Truth: He did not deceive them; but what he &s;aid in the Sen&s;e he intended it, and in the Sen&s;e they under&s;tood it, might be &s;trictly true, tho' the Son in <HI>another Nature,</HI> or Character, did <HI>actually know,</HI> what is here &s;aid he did <HI>not know.</HI>&mdash;And if from what is revealed to us concerning our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, we have &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to conclude, that this of <HI>his not knowing the Day,</HI> is to be under&s;tood of him con&s;idered as <HI>Man,</HI> or as our Prophet and Teacher, and <HI>not Per&s;onally;</HI> then we have no Rea&s;on to complain or object, that what he &s;ays is incon&s;i&s;tent with Truth and Sincerity: And that we have no &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e this, your Author has not yet proved; and to infer it from the Speech or Sentence

it&s;elf, &s;ingly con&s;idered, is ab&s;urd; &s;ince it's being con&s;i&s;tent or incon&s;i&s;tent with Truth and Sincerity depends upon the Circum&s;tances of the Time at which it was delivered; upon our Saviour's whole Di&s;cour&s;e with his Di&s;ciples; and upon their Knowledge or Notion of what he &s;aid: I &s;ay, it depended upon all the&s;e with regard to <HI>them:</HI> And with regard to <HI>us,</HI> it depends upon the whole Record God hath given of his Son. If he has not &s;ufficiently revealed to us, that this is to be under&s;tood of his <HI>human Nature</HI> only; but of him <HI>Per&s;onally</HI> con&s;idered; then it is true, that &s;uppo&s;ing him to be GOD, is making him &s;peak in|con&s;i&s;tent with Truth. But while he has revealed to us, that it is to be under&s;tood of him con&s;idered as <HI>Man,</HI> or our Teacher only, and not of him <HI>Per&s;onally,</HI> the above Suppo&s;ition implies no Contradiction or Incon&s;i&s;tency, with the &s;tricte&s;t Truth and Sincerity.&mdash; He that hath told us, <HI>the Son did not know,</HI> &amp;c, hath al&s;o told us, what we are to under&s;tand by the <HI>Son,</HI> when this Know|ledge is denied of him, <HI>viz.</HI> That we are to con&s;ider him as <HI>Man,</HI> as our Prophet and Teacher, and not in his <HI>divine</HI> Nature, as <HI>truly God;</HI> tho' He is to be thus con&s;idered, when 'tis &s;aid, <HI>He knows All Things;</HI> the <HI>Hearts of Men,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash; This indeed is not delivered to us in the &s;ame Words and Terms I have u&s;ed; but it is plainly taught in that Record God hath given of his Son; at lea&s;t your Author has not &s;hewn, that this is not revealed to us by the &s;ame Scriptures that tell us, <HI>The Son knows not the Day,</HI> &amp;c. So that tho' our Sa|viour did not make an immediate expre&s;s Re&s;erve when he &s;aid, <HI>The Son did not know the Day;</HI> yet it amounts to ju&s;t the &s;ame, if the Di&s;ciples under&s;tood him with this Limitation; and if the Scriptures, which give us an Account of him, teach us to under&s;tand tho&s;e Words in this limited Sen&s;e, it is the &s;ame Ca&s;e: We have as little Rea&s;on to complain and object, that his &s;aying, <HI>The Son did not know,</HI> &amp;c. is incon&s;i&s;tent with Truth, if he

Ju&s;t &s;o barbarous and unrea|&s;onable is it for your Author to &s;elect this <HI>&s;ingle Sentence</HI> of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour and declare, That it is not true of the Son, con&s;idered in the Light or Character in which he &s;pake of him; in which his Di&s;ciples under&s;tood him; and in which the holy Scriptures teach us to under&s;tand him; becau&s;e it is not true of the SON con&s;idered in his utmo&s;t Latitude, if he be GOD. &mdash; This may be further illu&s;trated by the very In&s;tances your Author brings to &s;upport his Objection: Tho' there is a wide Difference between two Arms, or two Eyes, belonging to one Man, and two infinite di&s;tant Natures being united in one Per|&s;on; the Ca&s;es are too unlike and unparrallel to prove any Thing of each other, and therefore are not to your Author's Purpo&s;e, in the Light he con&s;iders them; but may &s;erve to illu&s;trate what I have &s;aid.&mdash;Thus, &s;uppo&s;ing a Man to have two Eyes, the one vivid and piercing, by which he could di&s;cern minute Atoms and Objects at a great Di&s;tance; the other dull and &s;hort-&s;ighted, affected only by near and &s;hining Objects: Suppo&s;ing this Man di&s;|cour&s;ing with me concerning the Sight of his poore&s;t Eye;

or, being a&s;ked by me, how far, and what Objects he could &s;ee; &s;hould an&s;wer, "I can &s;ee no farther than &s;uch a particular Object, and there are only &s;uch and &s;uch large and &s;hining Objects that I can di&s;cern;" would this be incon&s;i&s;tent with Truth and Sincerity, becau&s;e he could and did &s;ee farther and other Objects with his be&s;t Eye?&mdash;Or, if without any previous Di&s;cour&s;e of the Matter, he &s;hould &s;ay, "I don't &s;ee &s;uch and &s;uch Things; there are certain Objects I don't di&s;cern:" But &s;hould add, that he meant by his dull &s;hort-&s;ighted Eye; for with the other he could di&s;cern minute Atoms and Objects at a Di&s;tance: Could his fir&s;t A&s;&s;ertion in this Ca&s;e be ju&s;tly deemed incon&s;i&s;tent with Truth, if the latter were true?

that the Di&s;ciples either thus under&s;tood our Lord at the very Time, or were thus in&s;tructed by him &s;oon after, is evident; becau&s;e they &s;oon after attributed infinite un|limited Knowledge to Him: <HI>Lord, Thou knowe&s;t all Things.</HI>&mdash;And they are Examples for us; and we are to con&s;ider the whole Scriptures as one continued Di&s;cour&s;e.

<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 2. <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That Je&s;us Chri&s;t intended no &s;uch Di&s;tinction of <HI>two Natures,</HI> becau&s;e he puts not the Di&s;tinction or Oppo&s;ition between the <HI>Son of Man,</HI> and <HI>the eternal Word,</HI> (as &s;ome &s;peak,) but between <HI>the Son</HI> and <HI>his Father;</HI> not the Son knows, but only the Father. &mdash; Which is as much as to &s;ay, None knows but the Father, and the Son is in no Nature the Father; therefore the Son could not know in any Nature, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> &mdash; I have not here u&s;ed exactly your Author's Words, but taken the whole of his Mean|ing. &mdash; In <HI>an&s;wer</HI> to which, I would ob&s;erve, That tho' the Di&s;tinction or Oppo&s;ition is not expre&s;ly put between <HI>the Son of Man</HI> and <HI>the eternal Word</HI> in the very &s;ame Ver&s;e, or the next following; yet that the Di&s;ciples under|&s;tood it <HI>then,</HI> or were taught to under&s;tand it, with the Di&s;|tinction thus put between the <HI>human</HI> Nature and the <HI>divine,</HI> or the <HI>eternal Word,</HI> is evident from their afterwards attri|buting to the <HI>eternal Word,</HI> or Chri&s;t <HI>per&s;onally</HI> con&s;ider|ed, infinite, unlimited Knowledge: And that we are to under&s;tand the Di&s;tinction or Oppo&s;ition thus, is evident from the Current of Scripture; which declares our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour to be <HI>God manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h;</HI> proclaims his <HI>Divinity</HI> and <HI>Equality</HI> with God the Father. &mdash; And this I have &s;hewn, vindicates our Saviour's A&s;&s;ertion, if he was really GOD, from the Imputation of Fal&s;ehood or Incon&s;i&s;tency with Truth, equally as if he had made an immediate expre&s;s Re&s;erve; and by Parity of Rea&s;on,
<PB N="30" REF="007862_0031_102DEA598E4E2F88">
and plain Con&s;equence, this vindicates him in not putting the Di&s;tinction or Oppo&s;ition immediately and in expre&s;s Terms, if he did know as GOD, between the <HI>Son of Man</HI> and the <HI>eternal Word;</HI> or between his <HI>Humanity</HI> and <HI>Divinity</HI> &mdash; So that it by no means follows, that our Sa|viour did not intend this Di&s;tinction of <HI>two Natures,</HI> be|cau&s;e he does not immediately and in expre&s;s Terms put the Di&s;tinction or Oppo&s;ition between the <HI>Son of Man</HI> and the <HI>eternal Word:</HI> There was either no Occa&s;ion of ex|pre&s;&s;ing this Di&s;tinction <HI>then,</HI> they knowing it <HI>before,</HI> or he taught it there <HI>pre&s;ently after,</HI> and hath &s;ufficiently revealed it to us by his Word; if dive&s;ted of Prejudice, we with good and hone&s;t Hearts read and con&s;ider it. &mdash; But then, <Q>Are not all excepted from this Knowledge, but the <HI>Father</HI> only? How then can the <HI>Son</HI> have it in any Nature?</Q> <HI>An&s;w.</HI> The general Term of <HI>Father</HI> here comprehends the <HI>whole God-head;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> are included under it, as well as the <HI>Fa|ther.</HI>&mdash;But how, What Proof or Ground is there to &s;up|po&s;e that by the Term <HI>Father,</HI> we are to under&s;tand <HI>three di&s;tinct Per&s;ons</HI> here; and that the <HI>Son of Man</HI> &s;tands oppo&s;ed to all the&s;e included under the Term or Appel|lation of <HI>Father? &mdash; An&s;w.</HI> Becau&s;e the holy Scriptures tell us, <HI>There are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Gho&s;t, and the&s;e Three are One.</HI> &mdash;That the <HI>Father and Son are One.</HI>&mdash;That <HI>He that hath &s;een the Son hath &s;een the Father.</HI> &mdash; That <HI>He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father.</HI> &mdash;That the Son <HI>is the true God, &mdash; God ble&s;&s;ed forever.</HI> That He <HI>knows all Things.</HI> &mdash; That He <HI>&s;earcheth the Reins and the Hearts,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>i. e.</HI> in &s;hort, The God-head, or Deity, is plainly repre&s;ented as &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in <HI>three di&s;|tinct Per&s;ons,</HI> who equally partake of the divine E&s;&s;ence, and of all natural and moral Perfections; and con&s;e|quently of <HI>Knowledge.</HI> Hence we conclude, That as all but the Father are excepted from the Knowledge of <HI>that

<PB N="32" REF="007862_0033_102DEA5E66D350D8">
than any other Book in general, is no Argument that the above Interpretation is wrong. &mdash; And to apply this Rea&s;on to the particular Ca&s;e before us, it amounts to no more than this, That if the above Interpretation be allowed, this particular Sentence,&mdash;<HI>of that Day knows no Man,</HI> &amp;c, is hard to under&s;tand, when con&s;idered <HI>&s;ingly</HI> by it&s;elf, without any regard to the other Scriptures; for if we take, and impartially con&s;ider, the whole Scrip|tures, they evidently direct us to this Interpretation; as I have &s;hewn to be the Ca&s;e, notwith&s;tanding all your Author has yet offered to the contrary.&mdash;And is it a good or &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to reject an Interpretation grounded upon a Variety of plain Scriptures, merely becau&s;e the Text it &s;elf, to which the Interpretation is applied, if con&s;idered <HI>&s;ingly</HI> by it &s;elf, is hard to under&s;tand, accor|ding to this Interpretation?

had as many Occa&s;ions to &s;ubjoin a <HI>Caution</HI> to the one as to the other.&mdash;The mo&s;t obvious Rea&s;on why they did not, in either of them, appears to me to be this;&mdash; That the Evangeli&s;ts &s;pake and wrote as they were in&s;pired or moved by the holy Gho&s;t; who did not &s;ugge&s;t to them the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Caution.&mdash;The Evangeli&s;ts (as I imagine) never thought, that the <HI>Pope's Chair</HI> would be founded on <HI>One;</HI> the Doctrine of <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation</HI> on <HI>another;</HI> and the Doctrine of <HI>Arius</HI> on the <HI>third,</HI> of the&s;e In&s;tances: &mdash; But infinite Wi&s;dom has &s;een fit (for wi&s;e and holy Ends no doubt) to permit them <HI>all;</HI>&mdash;Tho' I am far from thinking that the Want of &s;uch Cautions, as your Author requires, will be any Excu&s;e either for <HI>Pa|pists</HI> or <HI>Arians.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PART II. OBSERVATIONS <HI>upon</HI> CHAP. 3d <HI>of Mr.</HI> Emlyn's <HI>Inquiry into the</HI> Scrip|ture Account <HI>of</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>HERE your Author propo&s;es, <HI>fir&s;t;</HI> to <HI>An&s;wer the Objections</HI> again&s;t his Hypothe&s;is; or <HI>refute the Ar|guments,</HI> u&s;ually brought from Scripture, to prove JESUS CHRIST to be <HI>really</HI> GOD, <HI>equal</HI> with the Father:&mdash;And he tells us, That becau&s;e <HI>Omni&s;cience</HI> is that infinite Per|fection, which is with the greate&s;t Shew of Rea&s;on, or plau&s;ible Te&s;timony alledged to belong to Chri&s;t; there|fore he choo&s;es to &s;ingle out <HI>This</HI> in particular.&mdash; But I am much mi&s;taken, if he had not <HI>another</HI> and a <HI>truer</HI> Rea&s;on in his own Brea&s;t for this Conduct, <HI>viz.</HI> That his Rea&s;oning upon <HI>This</HI> Topic has a greater Appear|ance of Truth, and is better adapted to deceive the In|con&s;iderate and Un&s;table, than it could be upon &s;ome <HI>others,</HI> which are alledged in Vindication of the &s;upreme Deity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t:&mdash; That this is actually the Ca&s;e, I doubt not, will be made to appear hereafter. &mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hall, in a few Words, expo&s;e the <HI>Fallacy</HI> of his Rea|&s;oning, upon the <HI>very Topic</HI> he has &s;ingled out; what|ever <HI>End</HI> he propo&s;ed in choo&s;ing <HI>This,</HI> rather than <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P>IT is alledged, in Vindication of the <HI>&s;upreme Deity</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, That the Di&s;ciples attribute to Him, infinite, unlimited Knowledge; John 16.30. <HI>Now are we &s;ure, that thou knowe&s;t all Things,</HI> &amp;c. And, Chap, 21. 17. <HI>Lord, Thou knowe&s;t all Things,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;Now, infinite, un|limited Knowledge, is an incommunicable Perfection, and can belong only to the <HI>&s;upreme</HI> God; and therefore, if the Di&s;ciples Te&s;timony be true, CHRIST is the <HI>&s;u|preme</HI> GOD; &s;ince they expre&s;ly attribute &s;uch Know|ledge to Him. &mdash; There is no Way to <HI>evade</HI> this Argu|ment, but by proving the Di&s;ciples Te&s;timony to be <HI>fal&s;e;</HI> which is what your Author attempts. &mdash; He tells

us, <Q>The&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions are Words of Admiration from the Di&s;ciples not yet in&s;pired; and are intended only to expre&s;s a very great and comprehen&s;ive Knowledge, far from infinite, divine Omni&s;cience:</Q></P>

<P>For,</P>
<P N="3">3^d^l^y, IT'S to the la&s;t Degree ab&s;urd, to conclude, that the Di&s;ciples did not intend <HI>infinite, divine Omni&s;cience;</HI> becau&s;e they infer from our Saviour's Knowledge, that <HI>He came forth from God.</HI>&mdash;This is the <HI>very Thing</HI> I would infer from it, &mdash; That HE proceeded from the Father; and <HI>Equally</HI> partakes of the <HI>Divine E&s;&s;ence,</HI> and <HI>all po&s;&s;ible Perfections:</HI>&mdash; Or, If we under&s;tand his <HI>coming forth from the Father,</HI> of his Mi&s;&s;ion into the World; the inferring this from his Knowledge, is no Argument that the Di&s;ciples did not look upon Him to be <HI>Omni&s;ci|ent,</HI> and intentionally attribute this Perfection to Him.&mdash; But I am much mi&s;taken, if the Di&s;ciples were not thoroughly convinced and a&s;&s;ured of his <HI>divine Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> long before this; and therefore think it mo&s;t probable, that by <HI>coming forth from God,</HI> they intended his <HI>&s;upreme</HI> Deity, and <HI>Equallity</HI> with the Father; which they in|fer'd from his <HI>infinite</HI> Knowledge.&mdash;They <HI>&s;urely</HI> believed Him to be at lea&s;t, <HI>a Prophet &s;ent of God,</HI> long before this: His Miracles were a mo&s;t convincing Proof of this: Even &s;ome of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> declared, that <HI>no Man could

St. <HI>Peter</HI> mu&s;t have argued very fooli&s;hly, as well as fal&s;ely, to have infer'd, That Chri&s;t <HI>knew his Heart;</HI> or, (which is the &s;ame,) his <HI>Love to Him,</HI> merely becau&s;e he <HI>knew many Things;</HI> or had a great and comprehen&s;ive Knowledge; or in|deed any Knowledge &s;hort of <HI>infinite, divine</HI> Omni&s;cience; or that <HI>of the Hearts of all Men,</HI> which belongs <HI>only</HI> to GOD <HI>&s;upreme.</HI></P>
<P>BUT that our Lord Je&s;us had <HI>infinite, divine Omni&s;ci|ence,</HI> and the <HI>Knowledge of Men's Hearts</HI> in particular, appears not only from <HI>the&s;e</HI> and other Expre&s;&s;ions of the like Nature;&mdash;But</P>

<P>LET us now inquire what your Author has &s;aid to in|validate this, which he promi&s;es a &s;erious Con&s;ideration; and, with an Air of Seriou&s;ne&s;s, in&s;inuates that, <Q>'Tis no wonder that <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;hould not know of any other to whom that Excellency, <HI>viz.</HI> the Knowledge of the Hearts of all Men, was communicated, than God only.</Q>
If I under&s;tand him, he means that it's no wonder if <HI>So|lomon</HI> was ignorant that this Excellency was, or could be communicated from God to any one:&mdash;If &s;o, this is a Point I &s;hall not even attempt to di&s;pute; it being the very Thing I would infer from the Words of <HI>Solomon,</HI> that he thought the Knowledge of the Hearts of all Men <HI>peculiar to God;</HI> that He <HI>only,</HI> has an underived, inde|pendent and unlimited Knowledge of the Hearts of Men; which is an incommunicable Perfection or Excellency; a di&s;tingui&s;hing Character of the <HI>&s;upreme</HI> God; tho' in &s;ome

low Degree and at &s;ome particular Times, one Man may have the Knowledge of another's Heart by Revelation from God; <HI>i. e.</HI> in &s;hort, God may reveal to his Crea|tures, Things which they could not know or di&s;cover by any other Means: But does it hence follow, that Chri&s;t's Knowledge of Men's Hearts is communicated to Him? or, that it's derived from and dependent upon a|ny one? Does it follow by any Rules of Rea&s;oning, ex|cepting tho&s;e your Author hath invented, that our Savi|our's Knowledge of the Hearts of Men was derived from <HI>another,</HI> becau&s;e that of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles was; who at certain Times and in &s;ome Degree had this Know|ledge? Surely no; an Appeal to the Rea&s;on and &s;ober Thought of every Per&s;on is a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to &s;uch forced and unnatural Conclu&s;ions.&mdash;But,</P>
<P><Q>DOES not Chri&s;t him&s;elf own, that he knew what he reveals in the &s;even Epi&s;tles to the &s;even Churches by Revelation from God? <HI>It was the Revelation which God gave to Je&s;us Christ,</HI>&amp;c.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer;</HI> To give this any Weight at pre&s;ent, the Truth and Ju&s;tne&s;s of your Author's Objections, in Chap. 2^d, mu&s;t be granted; but the Vanity of the&s;e hath been already &s;hewn, and therefore the Method of Interpretation I have maintained again&s;t them, is a plain and natural So|lution of this, <HI>viz.</HI> That God gave this Revelation to Chri&s;t, as <HI>Man,</HI> or as our <HI>Mediator,</HI> and therewith a Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>&s;hew it to his Servants;</HI> &s;o that this Re|velation's being given to him in this Character, is no Ar|gument again&s;t his <HI>Divinity,</HI> or his infinite, divine Om|ni&s;cience.</P>
<P>IT would be trifling to take Notice of his quibbling An|&s;wer to tho&s;e who &s;ay, that Chri&s;t's &s;earching the Heart imports it to be his <HI>own Act.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>He argues <HI>Secondly,</HI> <Q>THAT there is no Ab&s;urdity in attributing this Knowledge of the Heart to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, tho' he be <HI>not</HI> the mo&s;t high GOD. That he knows

Things with &s;ome <HI>Limitation</HI> as to the Degree, and in Dependence on his Father as to the Manner, he thinks appears from what he has already &s;aid; and therefore concludes that the Knowledge of the Heart attributed to him, mu&s;t be &s;uch as is con&s;i&s;tent with his <HI>&s;ubordi|nation</HI> to the Father's <HI>greater</HI> Knowledge.</Q></P>
<P>BUT as I have already &s;hewn, that tho&s;e Texts from which Chri&s;t's <HI>inferiority</HI> or <HI>&s;ubordination</HI> to the Father has been argued, are to be under&s;tood of his <HI>human Na|ture,</HI> or of him as <HI>Mediator,</HI> and not of him <HI>Per&s;onally;</HI> and removed the Objections again&s;t this Interpretation; &s;o the Conclu&s;ion your Author makes is invalid: There is no Nece&s;&s;ity, nor any &s;ufficient Rea&s;on yet produced, that the Knowledge of Chri&s;t mu&s;t be &s;uch as is con&s;i&s;tent with any <HI>&s;ubordination</HI> to the Father's Knowledge.</P>
<P>IT has not yet been &s;hewn, that the Father has greater Knowledge than He; and therefore it can with no Pro|priety be concluded, that his Knowledge mu&s;t be <HI>&s;ubordi|nate</HI> to the Father's: This is begging the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>AND now, &s;hould the Point be granted, which your Author labours &s;o long upon, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That it can ne|ver be demon&s;trated, that it exceeds a <HI>finite Capacity</HI> to know the Concerns of all on this Earth, when the enlarged Under&s;tanding is a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the highe&s;t Man|ner by <HI>divine</HI> Influence and Revelation.</Q>&mdash;Yet this can no Ways militate again&s;t the infinite, divine Omni&s;cience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: At lea&s;t, it will be as difficult to &s;how, that whatever cannot be demon&s;trated to be ab&s;urd or impo&s;&s;ible is true of Him, as that a finite Being cannot po&s;&s;ibly know all the Concerns of this Earth.</P>
<P>YOUR Author's Argument &s;tands thus:&mdash;"It cannot be demon&s;trated impo&s;&s;ible, that a <HI>finite</HI> Being &s;hould by any Means know the Concerns of all on this Earth; and therefore tho' Chri&s;t knows the Concerns of all on this Earth, yet he is a <HI>finite</HI> Being, and has not infinite, divine Omni&s;cience."&mdash;This is plainly your Author's Sen&s;e; th&ocirc;
<PB N="47" REF="007862_0048_102DEA80D348CC50">

Where, <HI>All the Angels of God</HI> are commanded <HI>to wor&s;hip</HI> HIM.&mdash; But it will &s;ufficiently confirm what has been &s;aid (if there be need of further Te&s;timony) to produce In&s;tances from Scripture, where <HI>religious Wor&s;hip</HI> is evidently given to CHRIST, as the proper and ultimate Object of it.</P>
<P>I FORBEAR mentioning the many In&s;tances of his re|ceiving Wor&s;hip from his own Di&s;ciples and others, be|fore his Crucifixion and A&s;cention; becau&s;e it may be &s;aid, perhaps, that this was not <HI>religious Wor&s;hip;</HI> nor any

<P>BUT there are al&s;o various In&s;tances where <HI>religious Wor&s;hip and Homage</HI> was paid our Lord JESUS by the Apo&s;tles after his A&s;cention.</P>
<P N="1">1.

'Tis mo&s;t <HI>immediately</HI> applied to Him;&mdash; <HI>And, Thou Lord,</HI> &amp;c; and terminates in Him, without any Re&s;erve or Limitation.

<P>BUT your Author attempts to an&s;wer all that has been &s;aid, or can be &s;aid, to &s;upport the Doctrine of CHRIST'<HI>S Divinity,</HI> at once, by offering it as his Judg|ment, that this &s;ubverts the Go&s;pel Doctrine of his <HI>Me|diation.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I particularly examine and an&s;wer his Rea&s;ons for this, I beg Leave to premi&s;e a few Things, <HI>viz.</HI> (1.) That a Con&s;ideration of the plain Proofs and Arguments which have been offered for the <HI>&s;upreme Deity</HI> of JESUS CHRIST, will make a wi&s;e Man exceeding cautious how he yields his Faith to the contrary, without plain and in|telligible Arguments, or an over-balance of Evidence and Proof either from Scripture or Rea&s;on, or from both. (2.) In Con&s;ideration of what has been &s;aid in Vindica|tion of the <HI>&s;upreme Deity</HI> of CHRIST, it would be fooli&s;h to deny and di&s;believe it, merely becau&s;e there is &s;ome|thing in it my&s;terious, hard to under&s;tand, and above or beyond the Comprehen&s;ion of our Rea&s;on.&mdash;To believe Things which are <HI>contrary</HI> to Rea&s;on or common Sen&s;e; or to invent and forge My&s;teries without any Foundation, and recommend them for Doctrines of Truth, which ought to be believed, is ab&s;urd and fooli&s;h:&mdash;But to be|lieve there is no Truth <HI>above,</HI> or <HI>beyond</HI> the Comprehen|&s;ion of our Rea&s;on, is equally &s;o; e&s;pecially if they be &s;uch as re&s;pect the divine Nature, Perfections and Attri|butes, which are <HI>incomprehen&s;ible;</HI> and which <HI>none by &s;earching can find out.</HI>&mdash;Thus the ingenious and learned Doctor <HI>Leng</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>That if a Revelation from GOD is nece&s;&s;ary to teach us any Thing concerning the di|vine

Nature, and his De&s;igns towards Mankind, and in Relation to a future State, more than what we could naturally know before; it mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be &s;ome|thing which our Rea&s;on could not di&s;cover: And as far as the Nature of an infinite Being is concerned in it, it mu&s;t exceed our finite Capacities by the very Nature of Things; and yet the Belief of it, when &s;o revealed, may be very rea&s;onable, &s;o long as it implies no Con|tradiction.</Q>
&mdash; He adds, <Q>And indeed it would be a much greater Prejudice again&s;t a Revelation's being from God, if it had no Marks in it of any Thing but what human Rea&s;on could have di&s;covered without it.</Q>
See <HI>Leng</HI>'s Serm. at <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Lect. Pag. 503. (3.) Before I di&s;tinctly con&s;ider your Author's Opinion, I would ob|&s;erve in general, what the common Notion of <HI>Trinitarians</HI> is; and that which I imagine he intends to oppo&s;e, con|cerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t as our <HI>Mediator</HI>&mdash;It is briefly this, that in the one Godhead or Divine E&s;&s;ence there are three real Differences, or di&s;tinct Per&s;ons, repre&s;ented and di&s;|tingui&s;hed in Scripture by the Names of <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy-Gho&s;t:</HI> &mdash; That the&s;e Three <HI>equally</HI> partake of the One God-head, or divine E&s;&s;ence:&mdash; That the <HI>Second</HI> of the&s;e divine Per&s;ons, (<HI>viz.</HI> the SON,) in order to the Redemption of Mankind from moral Evil and Depravity, and eternal Death and Mi&s;ery, (the ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of their Rebellion and Apo&s;tacy from God,) freely and voluntarily engaged to be our <HI>Mediator</HI> and <HI>Advocate,</HI> to vindicate the Honour and Authority of the divine Law, by a&s;&s;uming the human Nature into a <HI>per&s;onal Union</HI> with the divine; which in due Time he actually did, and hath forever vindicated and e&s;tabli&s;hed the Honour and Authority of the divine Law by his per|fect Obedience and Sufferings: &mdash; That after his Obedi|ence and Sufferings were compleated, He, (the <HI>Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, per&s;onally united</HI> to the DIVINE NATURE) a&s;cended into Heaven, to the Place of GOD'S mo&s;t imme|diate

<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> I SHALL not pretend to determine what U&s;e &s;ome may have made of the baffled Arguments of <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> when they wrote again&s;t the <HI>Unitarians,</HI> in Vindication of the <HI>Divinity</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI>&mdash;But this I am bold to affirm, that they have no need to do it in one &s;ingle In&s;tance;&mdash;and that they have not done it in the In&s;tances your Author mentions, 1. No one &s;urely at this Day pretends, that the Novelty of <HI>Arian</HI> Principles is much of an Objection again&s;t them, (as the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> hold that the Novelty of <HI>Prote&s;tanti&s;m</HI> is again&s;t that:) Ala&s;s! They are <HI>antique</HI> e|nough to claim our Veneration, if <HI>that</HI> alone was &s;ufficient, having been extant at Times for almo&s;t 1500 Years; pa&s;&s;ed thro' various Changes and fancied Emendations; been once and again &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and revived in <HI>Europe, A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa;</HI> obtaining &s;ometimes in a very &s;urpriz|ing

Manner, thro' that Love of Novelty, which is rooted in our Nature; but have never obtained long at once, to any con&s;iderable Degree, in either of tho&s;e Parts of the World: Allow me to gue&s;s the Rea&s;on,&mdash;That when they become common, and their Novelty cea&s;ed to recommend them; when Men come to calm and &s;erious Con&s;ideration, they ea&s;ily &s;ee their <HI>Fallacy</HI> and <HI>dangerous Tendency,</HI> and quickly rejected them. This is the Novelty objected per|haps by &s;ome again&s;t your Author's Opinion, which cer|tainly is no Commendation to it; and I humbly tru&s;t, (if nothing el&s;e will do it) that this will prevent its obtain|ing long, and to any great Degree in <HI>New-England.</HI> &mdash; 2. It is judged, That our Saviour's being &s;tiled, the <HI>Image of God,</HI> is no Argument that He is not GOD; and yet 'tis thought at the &s;ame Time a probable Argument, That the Fathers did not look upon the Elements to be <HI>changed</HI> into the real Sub&s;tance of CHRIST'S Body and Blood, in the Sen&s;e which <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> hold, becau&s;e they oft call them the <HI>Images</HI> thereof. There is too manife&s;t a <HI>Difference</HI> between the&s;e Propo&s;itions, to need any Illu&s;tration: It is not &s;uppo&s;ed, That CHRIST is called the <HI>Image of</HI> GOD with re&s;pect to his <HI>Humanity;</HI> for that can bear but a faint Re&s;emblance to the DEITY, to which nothing may be likened or compared; but that He is the <HI>Image</HI> of GOD, i. e. of the <HI>Father,</HI> in re&s;pect of His <HI>Divinity:</HI> The <HI>&s;econd</HI> Di&s;tinction or Difference in the DEITY is the <HI>expre&s;s Image</HI> of the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> On the other Hand, The <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> &s;uppo&s;e the Elements to be tran&s;ub&s;tantiated or changed into the <HI>real</HI> Sub&s;tance of CHRIST'S Body and Blood; but had the <HI>Fathers</HI> thought &s;o, they could with no Propriety have called them <HI>the Images</HI> thereof. CHRIST is called the <HI>Image</HI> of GOD in oppo&s;ition to GOD the <HI>Father;</HI> but the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> leave nothing to oppo&s;e the <HI>Image</HI> to.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> In Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> 'tis tho't evident, That St. <HI>Peter</HI> was <HI>inferior</HI> to the Church, and the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles (tho' not &s;ingly to each,)

becau&s;e he was <HI>&s;ent</HI> up and down by them: &mdash; And yet it is no Argument that the <HI>Son</HI> is <HI>inferior</HI> to the <HI>Father,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Trinitarians,</HI> becau&s;e he was <HI>&s;ent</HI> by Him. &mdash; Here again, is a manife&s;t Difference in the Po&s;ition and Circum&s;tances of the Arguments: &mdash; It is not the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> but the <HI>Office</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> that is in di&s;pute: 'Tis argued, that in <HI>Office</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> he was <HI>inferior</HI> to the Church, and the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, becau&s;e they &s;ent him up and down <HI>authoritatively:</HI> &mdash; On the other Hand, the <HI>Na|ture</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of the SON, is in di&s;pute; and 'tis hum|bly tho't, that it can be argued with no Propriety that the SON was <HI>inferior</HI> to the FATHER in <HI>the&s;e,</HI> merely be|cau&s;e He was <HI>&s;ent</HI> by Him: <HI>e. g.</HI> A <HI>Son</HI> may be as truly a <HI>Man</HI> as the <HI>Father,</HI> and yet be <HI>&s;ent</HI> by him; or <HI>two,</HI> that <HI>equally</HI> partake of human Nature and all it's Pro|perties, may &s;end <HI>each other</HI> by mutual Agreement.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> THERE can be no ju&s;t Grounds for your Author's Complaint, "That <HI>Trinitarians</HI> join with the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> in hood-winking People in Ignorance; forbidding them to enquire into and examine your Author's Princi|ples." &mdash; I can't think that any <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> will inveigh again&s;t the clo&s;e&s;t Examination and Enquiry into any of the Principles and Doctrines of our holy Religion; and e&s;pecially the more <HI>important</HI> and <HI>fundamental</HI> Points of it.&mdash; For my own Part, I heartily wi&s;h your Author's Opinion may meet with this Treatment wherever it goes; as I humbly think it will prove a mo&s;t effectual Means of &s;ecuring Men again&s;t it.&mdash;I therefore intreat all Men, clo&s;ely to examine, and &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider it, in all it's Parts, before they embrace it.&mdash;</P>
