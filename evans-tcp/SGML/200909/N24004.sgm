<P>The Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from he glory of his power.</P></Q>

<P N="1">1. THE &s;econd coming of our Lord, and the am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing &s;cenes which will th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n be opened, to the ever|la&s;ting confu&s;ion of his enemies, and the perpetual joy of his &s;aints, are the frequent &s;ubjects of holy writ&punc; The Prophets and Apo&s;tles, Chri&s;t and his Evangeli&s;ts, &s;peak often and largely on the&s;e matters; and though with &s;ome variety of phra&s;e and manner of repre&s;entation, yet without any contradiction. And they all treat them, not as points of more &s;peculation, the contemplation of which has a tendency to encrea&s;e our knowledge, elevate our conceptions, enlarge our views and exalt our minds, (which is doubtle&s;s the ca&s;e) but al&s;o and chiefly as di&s;|coveries of the utmo&s;t importance and concern to us all, which when cordially believed and attentively con&s;idered, have (through divine grace) the mo&s;t happy influence on our temper and conduct. And I have often thought that Chri&s;tianity would flouri&s;h much more than it does among us, if the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel imitated in this,
<PB N="4" REF="031758_0004_0FEE2F4439800438">their example, and led both &s;aints and &s;inners to the more frequent and &s;erious con&s;ideration of tho&s;e events which will &s;oon take place.</P>
<P N="2">2. Would we &s;ucce&s;sfully call &s;inners to repentance? Like Paul preaching at Athens we &s;hould te&s;tify, that <HI>God will appoint a day in which he will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, by that man whom he hath ordained.</HI>&mdash; Would we make <HI>the &s;inners in Zion afraid?</HI> Would we wi&s;h to &s;ee <HI>fearfulne&s;s &s;urprize the hypocrites?</HI> with the Prophet we mu&s;t demand, <HI>Who can endure devouring fire? Who can dwell with everla&s;ting burnings?</HI> Would we per&s;uade the delicate and effeminate to &s;elf-denial and mortification, to <HI>cut off the right hand and to pluck out the right eye,</HI> which <HI>off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd?</HI> We mu&s;t, with our Lord, re|mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d them, that it <HI>is better one of their members &s;hould peri&s;h, than that their whole body &s;hould be ca&s;t into hell, where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.</HI> Would we fortify the timorous again&s;t the fear of man, which always <HI>bringeth a &s;nare,</HI> and often leadeth into &s;in? We mu&s;t exhort them in the words of Je&s;us, <HI>not to fear tho&s;e who can only kill the body, but rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fear him who can de&s;troy both body and &s;oul in hell.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In &s;hort whether we would rou&s;e the carele&s;s, or excite the indolent, or reclaim the back &s;lider, or comfort the di&s;tre&s;t, or &s;uccour the tempted, or encourage the faint-hearted, or animate the faithful &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, patiently to endure hard&s;hips, courageou&s;ly fight his enemies, valiantly conquer the powers of darkne&s;s, and &s;eize the crown of everla&s;ting life;&mdash;we &s;hould bring the day of judgment in view, with the ter|rors of hell and the joys of heaven, and fetch our argu|ments,
<PB N="5" REF="031758_0005_0FEE314B4E294650">motives and encouragements thence.&mdash;Thus will the <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d,</HI> and <HI>tho&s;e who are far from righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> tremble, with Felix (who was alarmed at Paul's rea&s;on|ing concerning a judgment to come) and enquiring <HI>what ma&s;t we do to be &s;aved,</HI> will <HI>repent and be converted, that their &s;ins may be blotted out.</HI> And thus will the true believer <HI>rejoice in hope of the glory of God;</HI> and while for <HI>the joy that is &s;et before him he endures the cro&s;s and de&s;pi&s;es the &s;hame,</HI> he will <HI>give all diligence to be found of Chri&s;t</HI> at his coming <HI>in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and without &s;pot and blame|le&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Since then the&s;e are &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary and fruitful &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;o repeatedly offered to our con&s;ideration in the &s;acred &s;criptures, it may be profita|ble for us, frequently to employ&punc; our thoughts upon them. That we may do it for a few moments at this time, I have made choice of this mo&s;t alarming pa&s;&s;age of Scripture, in which the Apo&s;tle, with a view to their comfort and &s;upport under their &s;ufferings, puts the per|&s;ecuted Church of God at The&s;&s;alonica in remembrance of the very different &s;tate of things which would &s;oon take place, with regard to them and their per&s;ecutors. <HI>God</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>will recompence tribulation to tho&s;e who trouble you, and to you who are troubled re&s;t with us, when the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who</HI> (adds he) <HI>&s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de|&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord and from the glory of his power.</HI></P>

<ITEM>III. The <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>duration</HI> of the puni&s;hment which he will inflict upon them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e are all very important points, and well de&s;erve our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I &s;hall confine my&s;elf at pre&s;ent to the fir&s;t of them, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The certainty and manner of our Lord's &s;econd coming.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>certainty</HI> of his &s;econd coming, they who read and credit the Oracles of God, can entertain no doubt at all concerning it. It is there foretold and de|&s;cribed &s;o frequently and clearly, and with &s;uch a variety of method and expre&s;&s;ion, that the mo&s;t carele&s;s reader can hardly avoid ob&s;erving and under&s;tanding it. If therefore I produce &s;ome &s;cripture-te&s;timonies of this truth, it is not &s;o much with a view to illu&s;trate and confirm it, as to impre&s;s &s;o u&s;eful a &s;ubject more deeply upon our minds. For it is too manife&s;t, that it may be believed and under&s;tood, where it has, by no means, its proper influence.</P>
<P N="2">2. I ob&s;erve then, that this event was foretold by the ancient Prophets as well as by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles. Even <HI>Enoch of old prophe&s;ied, &s;aying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thou&s;and of his Saints, to execute judgment upon all.</HI> A truth this of which the P&s;almi&s;t was not ignorant, for in the 50th P&s;alm, he te&s;tifies, "<HI>Our God &s;hall come, and &s;hall not keep &s;ilence; a fire &s;hall devour be|fore
<PB N="7" REF="031758_0007_0FEE314F486C5770">him, and it &s;hall be very tempe&s;tuous rround about him: he &s;hall call the heavens from above and the earth, that he may judge his people.</HI> The&s;e predictions, &s;o clear and ex|pre&s;s that their &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be obvious to all, are confirmed and illu&s;trated by the te&s;timony of Daniel, chap. vii. ver. 9.10. <HI>I beheld</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>till the thrones were ca&s;t down and the Ancient of Days did &s;it, who&s;e garments was white as &s;now, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire; a fiery &s;tream i&s;&s;ued and came forth from before him: thou|&s;ands mini&s;tered unto him, and ten thou&s;and times ten thou|&s;and &s;tood before him: the judgment was &s;et, and the books were opened!</HI> What a &s;ublime and inimitably grand de|&s;cription which we have here, mix'd with admirable &s;im|plicity! How far does it exceed, in the&s;e re&s;pects, every thing to be met with in merely human compo&s;itions! How plainly does it appear to have been the effect, not of genius and art, but of a mind through the influences of the divine &s;pirit, elevated with the grandeur, awed with the maje&s;ty, and &s;truck with the terror of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e ancient prophecies of our Lord's &s;econd coming have the &s;anction of his own authority, not only as being in&s;pired by him, but as being confirmed by mo&s;t expre&s;s declarations, delivered by him&s;elf as well while upon earth as after his a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven, and that both before friends and enemies. I &s;hall produce only two or three of the&s;e as a &s;pecimen of the re&s;t. Thus when Caiaphas, the Elders and Scribes, had the bold|ne&s;s, or pre&s;umptuous wickedne&s;s rather, to call their Creator and final Judge to take his trial at their tribu|nal; before the&s;e he te&s;tified, <HI>Hereafter &s;hall ye &s;ee th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="8" REF="031758_0008_0FEE2F47533CE570">Son of Man &s;it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</HI> To his friends and followers, he often foretold the &s;ame event, though with a different view, not merely to convince and alarm, but al&s;o and e&s;pecially to comfort and encourage them. Thus, when predicting and de&s;cribing the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and the ruin of the Jewi&s;h church and polity, he &s;lides, (as it were) in&s;en&s;ibly into the important &s;ubject typi|fied by that, declaring, <HI>After the tribulation of tho&s;e days, the &s;un &s;hall be darkened and the moon &s;hall not give her light, and the &s;tars &s;hall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven &s;hall be &s;haken; and then &s;hall appear the &s;ign of the Son of Man in heaven; then &s;hall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they &s;hall &s;ee the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</HI> And in the next chapter, (Matt. xxv.) which, it &s;eems, con|tains the la&s;t public di&s;cour&s;e that our Lord delivered be|fore he was offered up, he declares to all, <HI>When the Son of Man &s;hall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him; then &s;hall he &s;it upon the throne of his glory, and be|fore him &s;hall be gathered all nations.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. To the&s;e expre&s;s and particular declarations de|livered by our Lord, while he tabernacled upon earth in his &s;tate of humiliation, we may &s;ubjoin his te&s;timony from heaven, after he entered upon his &s;tate of exalta|tion, and was inve&s;ted with all power in heaven and on earth. The <HI>faithful and true witne&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Alpha and Omega,</HI> when he takes his &s;olemn leave of us, in the con|clu&s;ion of the records of truth, te&s;tifies, both to friends and foes. <HI>Behold I come quickly, ble&s;&s;ed is he that keepeth the &s;ayings of the prophecy of this book.</HI> And again, <HI>Be|hold
<PB N="9" REF="031758_0009_0FEE3150E5793360">I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give unto every man according as his work &s;hall be.</HI> And yet again, <HI>He that te&s;tified the&s;e things, &s;aith, "Surely I come quickly,"</HI> To which the church replies, <HI>Amen; &s;o come, Lord Je&s;us.</HI> Thus by three te&s;timonies from the lips of Eternal Veracity, is this glorious truth e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P N="5">5. But that a doctrine &s;o &s;uperior to rea&s;on and yet ab&s;olutely certain and deeply intere&s;ting, might want to kind of evidence calculated to gain it credit, me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent immediately from heaven to bear witne&s;s to it. Thus when our Lord had given his apo&s;tles their la&s;t commi&s;&s;ion, and <HI>while they beheld, was taken up from them, a cloud receiving him out of their &s;ight; while they looked &s;tedfa&s;tly toward heaven as he went up, behold two men &s;tood by them in white apparel, who al&s;o &s;aid, "Ye men of Galilee, why &s;tand ye gazing up into heaven? This &s;ame Je&s;us who is taken up into heaven, &s;hall &s;o come again in like manner as ye have &s;een him go into heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. This te&s;timony of the holy angels, or of the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect, is frequently confirmed by that of the Holy Spirit in the mouths of the Apo&s;tles. But as I would not be tedious, I forbear to quote any particular pa&s;&s;ages, chu&s;ing rather to refer you to their &s;ermons, as recorded by St. Luke in the Acts, and to their various epi&s;tles, where you frequently meet with many glorious de&s;criptions of this grand event. The te&s;timonies already produced are more than &s;ufficient, not only to e&s;tabli&s;h us in the firm belief of this com|fortable truth, but al&s;o (which is mo&s;t wanting) to im|pre&s;s it deeply upon our minds. Good rea&s;on have we to &s;ettle it in our hearts, that as our Lord is <HI>gone before
<PB N="10" REF="031758_0010_0FEE2F4AC85095F8">to prepare a place for us, &s;o he will come again to receive us to him&s;elf, that where he is we may be al&s;o; and to tho&s;e who look for him he will appear the &s;econd time without &s;in unto &s;alvation.</HI> Yes,
<Q><L>"At the de&s;tined period &s;hall return</L>
<L>"He, once on earth, who bled for human guilt,</L>
<L>"And with him all our triumph o'er the tomb."</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>For then will he change our vile bodies and render them like unto his glorious body. Then will he be glorified in his &s;aints, and admired in all that believe.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Let us re&s;t a&s;&s;ured then, tho' <HI>the vi&s;ion is for an ap|pointed time,</HI> yet <HI>in the end it &s;hall &s;peak and &s;hall not lie.</HI> When the exact period &s;hall arrive indeed we know not, nor can we expect to know, &s;ince (as our Lord a&s;&s;ures us) it is kept a &s;ecret not only from all the men upon earth, but likewi&s;e from all the angels in heaven. But this we know, it will only be deferred till the <HI>my&s;tery of God &s;hall be fini&s;hed;</HI> till the prophecies &s;hall all be ful|filled, and a &s;ufficient number redeem'd from among men.&mdash;<HI>If therefore any &s;coffers ari&s;e in the&s;e la&s;t days, walk|ing after their own lu&s;ts, and &s;aying, Where is the promi&s;e of his coming? for ever &s;ince the Fathers fell a&s;leep, all things continue as they were:</HI> we reply, <HI>One day is with the Lord as a thou&s;and years, and a thou&s;and years as one day.</HI> No time is long or &s;hort with him who is <HI>Eternal:</HI> He can do the work of a thou&s;and years in one day, and a thou&s;and years, nay, the longe&s;t time, is no delay to him. <HI>He is not therefore &s;low concerning his pro|mi&s;e of coming again, though &s;ome men count it &s;lowne&s;s, but he is long-&s;uffering to us ward, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but rather that all &s;hould come to repentance.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="11" REF="031758_0011_0FEE315286058100">
8. <HI>But the day of the Lord will come,</HI> and when it comes it will come &s;uddenly and unexpectedly, <HI>as a thief in the night, &s;o that when men &s;hall &s;ay "peace and &s;afety," then &s;udden de&s;truction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child, and they &s;hall not e&s;cape. For behold</HI> (&s;ays Je&s;us) <HI>I come as a thief</HI> at unawares, and <HI>at &s;uch an hour as ye think not the Son of Man cometh.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed is he, therefore, that watcheth and keepeth his garments, le&s;t he walk naked, and they &s;ee his &s;hame. Watch we therefore, for ye know not at what hour our Lord doth come. For if ye will not watch, he will come as a thief, and we &s;hall not know what hour he will come upon us. If, like the evil &s;er|vant, we &s;ay in our heart, Our Lord delayeth his coming, and begin to &s;mite our fellow-&s;ervants, and to eat and drink with the drunken, our Lord &s;hall come in a day when we look not for him, and in an hour that we are not aware of, and will cut us a&s;under, and appoint us our portion with hypo|crites and unbelievers. There &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth.</HI></P>
<P>The certainty of our Lord's &s;econd coming (which it &s;eems, will not long be deferred and whenever it is, will be &s;udden and unexpected, even as the lightning com|eth out of the Fa&s;t and in an in&s;tant &s;hineth unto the We&s;t) I &s;ay, the certainty of his coming again being evident beyond contradiction or di&s;pute to all who credit the holy &s;criptures, I proceed as was propo&s;ed, to en|quire further into the <HI>manner</HI> of his coming, according to the repre&s;entation given of it in our text. For this too is doubtle&s;s a &s;ubject of enquiry well worthy the at|tention of all who love the Lord Je&s;us in &s;incerity, to whom nothing that particularly concerns him will appear trivial o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unimportant.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="031758_0012_0FEE2F5743562040">
Con&s;ider we then,</P>
<P>Secondly, In what form, with what attendants, and in what circum&s;tances he will appear?</P>
<P N="1">1. Will God's Eternal Son again for our &s;akes dive&s;t him&s;elf of his glory, relinqui&s;h his felicity, a&s;&s;ume our na|ture and &s;uffer in our &s;tead? Being <HI>made fle&s;h,</HI> will the Creator of all again become de&s;titute of every earthly ac|commodation, &s;o as not even to <HI>have a place where to lay his head, tho' the</HI> very <HI>foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts?</HI> Will he again endure hunger and thir&s;t, cold and nakedne&s;s, wearine&s;s and hard&s;hip of every kind? Will the &s;overeign Lord of the Univer&s;e, and the final judge of Angels and of Men, again &s;uffer him&s;elf to be apprehended by his creatures, arraign'd, tried, and con|demned; to be in&s;ulted, &s;pit upon, &s;courged and cruci|fied? Will the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us again groan under a mountain of guilt, and &s;u&s;tain the wrath of incen&s;ed ju&s;tice, till he is con&s;trained to confe&s;s, <HI>My &s;oul is exceeding &s;or|rowful, and &s;weats, as it were, great drops of blood?</HI> In &s;hort, will the Prince of Life, and the Light of the World again &s;uffer the pang of death, and go out in darkne&s;s?</P>
<P N="2">2. Oh, no! The&s;e days of his humiliation and &s;orrow are pa&s;t, and will return no more. For having van|qui&s;hed his and our enemies upon the cro&s;s, and led them in triumph at his chariot wheels, when be a&s;cended far above all heavens, in reward of his victorious &s;ufferings, he is inve&s;ted with power and dominion irre&s;i&s;table and eternal, and is rai&s;ed to a throne of glory at the Father's right-hand. Becau&s;e when <HI>he was in the form of God, he emptied him&s;elf</HI> of his honour and happine&s;s, <HI>taking the

The toy of bu&s;i|ne&s;s is diligently attended, the phantom of honour un|weariedly pur&s;ued, the enchantments of plea&s;ure a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly courted, the dream of amu&s;ement &s;olicitou&s;ly &s;ought; in &s;hort, the things of time and &s;en&s;e, though tran&s;itory in their duration, uncertain in their &s;tay, un&s;atisfactory in their nature, and even perplexing in their enjoyment; <HI>the&s;e</HI> engage the attention and engro&s;s the affection of high and low, young and old, rich and poor.&mdash;In the mean time, our immortal intere&s;ts, the favour of our God, and the eternal advantages and plea&s;ures of religion, are gene|rally buried in oblivion and neglected. Unrea&s;onable is this conduct indeed, but too certainly may it be laid to the charge of the generality of mankind, who&s;e whole behaviour clearly demon&s;trates that they are more intent upon providing for their momentary abode on earth, than their everla&s;ting exi&s;tence in heaven; and on &s;ecuring the favour and applau&s;e of their fellow-worms, than the good-will and approbation of their final Judge! But in this re&s;pect, let us not follow the multitude to do evil, to of|fend our God and throw away our own &s;ouls! nay rather, through grace, let us take care to be tho&s;e per&s;ons whom the Lord will acquit and reward at his coming, that we may make our appearance at his bar with joy and not with grief.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<PB N="27" REF="031758_0027_0FEE316A270E2370">and compare our&s;elves with the character de&s;cribed in the words of our text, where we are, briefly indeed, but at the &s;ame time very clearly and fully informed re&s;pecting this matter.

<P N="1">1. There is hardly any &s;ubject within the whole com|pa&s;s of religion, concerning which people in general are &s;o gro&s;sly mi&s;taken as the knowledge of God. All men profe&s;s to know God, tho' alas! the generality, by un|holy tempers and wicked works, contradict that pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and prove them&s;elves to be entire &s;trangers to him.&mdash;If a man have but heard or read a little about the Author of his being, if he believe his exi&s;tence and per|fections, he forthwith concludes that he knows God, and is very much offended if you pre&s;ume to call it in que&s;tion; tho', at the &s;ame time, this pretended knowledge has no happy influence upon him, but his &s;pirit and behaviour are ju&s;t the &s;ame, one might &s;uppo&s;e they would be, if he were a mere athei&s;t in the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though he profe&s;&s;es to be per&s;uaded of the infinite glory and ineffable maje&s;ty of the eternal Jehovah, yet
<PB N="82" REF="031758_0028_0FEE312538E8FC28">does he not inwardly reverence and humbly adore him but is light and trifling, &s;tupid and in&s;en&s;ible, perhaps, even in his immediate pre&s;ence, and during the &s;olemnity of his divine wor&s;hip. Tho' he declares his a&s;&s;ent to the immaculate holine&s;s and inflexible ju&s;tice of the Governor and final judge of the world, yet is he not aba&s;ed and confounded under a &s;en&s;e of his &s;infulne&s;s and guilt, nor does he abhor him&s;elf as in du&s;t and a&s;hes; but he is proud and impenitent, pre&s;uming upon the goodne&s;s of his heart, if his life has not been altogether blamele&s;s, and laying his own righteou&s;ne&s;s as the foundation of his ac|ceptance with God. Tho' (he thinks) he has no doubt at all of the boundle&s;s mercy and incomprehen&s;ible love of God in Chri&s;t; yet does he not chearfully tru&s;t him with humble confidence, and joyfully prai&s;e him with grateful acknowledgements; the pure flame of divine love does not glow upon the altar of his heart, nor does he devote his body and &s;oul as a living &s;acrifice to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But, on the contrary, he de&s;ponds and repines under dark and afflictive di&s;pen&s;ations of Provi|dence, while he ungratefully admits the vain world, Je|hovah's rival, to &s;hare, yea, <HI>engro&s;s</HI> his affections, and mo&s;t treacherou&s;ly harbours &s;in and &s;atan, the Lord's enemies, in the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of his &s;oul.</P>
<P N="3">3. So little is he benefited by the knowledge of God. But, in truth, what he has is not the knowledge of God, for if it were, it would infallibly produce the effects a&s;|cribed to this principle in the word of God. It would beget in him deep humility before God, entire confidence towards him, fervent love to him, and univer&s;al obe|dience; in &s;hort, holine&s;s and happine&s;s, a pledge and

<P>And as the knowledge of God is de&s;cended from heaven, &s;o is its <HI>excellent nature</HI> equal to its <HI>divine original.</HI> It is &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion of God upon the &s;oul, and &s;uch a clear, full and affecting di&s;covery of him as transforms us, more or le&s;s, into his divine likene&s;s.

<P N="6">6. To be a little more particular. 1&s;t. The know|lege of God never fails to <HI>humble us</HI> before him.

They are tho&s;e who have no higher and better acquain|tance with God, than that which they have attained by the exerci&s;e of their natural faculties and rational pow|ers, in the con&s;ideration of his word and works, having never received the <HI>&s;pirit of wi&s;dom and revelation</HI> (as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, Eph. i. 17.) <HI>in the knowledge of him.</HI> They are tho&s;e who have indeed <HI>heard of God by the hearing of the ear,</HI> but have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever (as it were) <HI>&s;een him</HI> by faith, or been inwardly enlightened with a di&s;covery of his glorious perfections, and therefore do not <HI>abhor them&s;elves, and repent as in du&s;t and a&s;bes:</HI> They are tho&s;e who do not know <HI>God in Chri&s;t reconciling them unto him&s;elf,
<PB N="36" REF="031758_0036_0FEE312D6231F3B8">not imputing their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them;</HI> and therefore not be|ing per&s;uaded that he is <HI>pacified towards them, after all they have done,</HI> they do not tru&s;t in him as a tender Father and a faithful Friend, in covenant with them through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They are tho&s;e who do not <HI>behold</HI> with open face (the veil of unbelief being removed) <HI>what man|ner of love the Father hath be&s;towed upon them,</HI> and there|fore do not con&s;ciou&s;ly <HI>love him, who hath fir&s;t loved them.</HI> They are tho&s;e, la&s;tly, who perhaps <HI>profe&s;s to know God,</HI> but <HI>by works deny him,</HI> not keeping his command|ments, or keeping them merely in external things, and that with reluctance, from a principal of &s;lavi&s;h fear, as tho' God were an hard ma&s;ter, and obedience to him a ta&s;k enjoined, which it would be our intere&s;t and happi|ne&s;s to be excu&s;ed from performing.&mdash;Upon all &s;uch will Chri&s;t, when he is revealed, take vengeance.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the other particular mentioned in our text, concerning the character of tho&s;e whom our Lord will condemn.</P>
<P>2dly. <HI>They obey not the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>A few ob&s;ervations on this, will greatly illu&s;trate what has already been advanced, and enable us &s;till better to judge concerning our true &s;tate and condition. I mean to pur&s;ue the &s;ame method I did under the former head, &s;hewing po&s;itively what is implied in <HI>obeying the go&s;pel</HI> that we may infer from thence who they are that <HI>di&s;obey it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood what is meant by <HI>obey|ing the go&s;pel,</HI> if we con&s;ider what the go&s;pel is. And this may be learnt, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, even from the origi|nal word (tran&s;lated <HI>go&s;pel</HI> in the New Te&s;tament) which,
<PB N="37" REF="031758_0037_0FEE317EE638E980">it is well-known, &s;ignifies <HI>good news</HI> or <HI>glad tidings.</HI> Ac|cordingly what is termed <HI>go&s;pel</HI> in the 4th of St. Luke, is tran&s;lated <HI>good tidings</HI> in the 51&s;t of I&s;aiah; and the preachers of the go&s;pel are repre&s;ented in the &s;ame chap|ters (ver. 7th) as bringing <HI>good tidings,</HI> as <HI>publi&s;hing peace</HI> as <HI>bringing good tidings of good, as publi&s;hing &s;alvation,</HI> This then is the every e&s;&s;ence of the go&s;pel, <HI>good tidings</HI> or <HI>tidings of good,</HI> even of peace and &s;alvation, of peace with God, and &s;alvation from &s;in and mi&s;ery. To ex|plain this a little,</P>
<P N="2">2. The go&s;pel brings us tidings of forgivene&s;s of &s;ins and acceptance with God, of free and full ju&s;tification, thro' faith in the Lord Je&s;us. It allows indeed, nay te&s;tifies, that <HI>there is none righteous</HI> (by nature) <HI>no not one, that all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God, that the whole world is guilty before God, and that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven again&s;t all the ungod|line&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men.</HI> And in con&s;equence of this, it declares, <HI>that by the deeds of the law &s;hall no fle&s;h living be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight.</HI> But then at the &s;ame time it a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>God hath &s;et forth his Son to be a pro|pitiation thro' faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> (both his ju&s;tice and mercy) <HI>for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins that are pa&s;t, thro' the forbearance of God.</HI> It affirms, that <HI>God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the world to him&s;elf, not impu|ting their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them;</HI> and that he <HI>hath committed to</HI> his &s;ervants <HI>the word of reconciliation.</HI> And hence they agree to offer pardoning mercy to all penitent &s;inners, and to bear witne&s;s, that <HI>who&s;oever believeth on Chri&s;t doth receive forgivene&s;s of &s;ins;</HI> yea, <HI>that by him all that believe
<PB N="38" REF="031758_0038_0FEE3133EF0696E8">are ju&s;tified from all things, from which they could not be ju&s;tified</HI> by their own obedience.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it appears what it is to obey the go&s;pel in this view of it, as it is a manife&s;tation of pardoning a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y thro' a Mediator. It is, 1&s;t. to &s;ee and feel our&s;elves guilty before God, and therefore to renounce all co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|dence in our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, from a conviction of its in&s;ufficiency for our ju&s;tification. It is, 2dly, to apply to the all-&s;ufficient merits of our Redeemer, with p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tent hearts, for&s;aking our &s;ins, and putting our whole tru&s;t in him for &s;alvation pre&s;ent and eternal. It is, 3dly, firmly to believe and appropriate to our&s;elves God's gracious promi&s;es of pardon and everla&s;ting life made to us for his &s;ake. This is implied in believing in Chri&s;t, and all who thus believe, are <HI>ju&s;tified by the faith of Chri&s;t,</HI> and, in this re&s;pect, <HI>obey the go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Indeed we cannot thus believe our&s;elves; but then for our comfort the go&s;pel is further a di&s;pen&s;ation of the Spirit of God given to work this faith in us, witne&s;s this ju&s;tification to our &s;ouls, and &s;anctifying our nature, to re&s;tore us to that image of God in which we were ori|ginally created. It &s;uppo&s;es that our <HI>&s;ins have &s;epa|rated between us and God,</HI> and cau&s;ed him to hide <HI>his face from us,</HI> whence <HI>we are alienated from the life of God,</HI> and <HI>even dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.</HI> It takes for granted (and well it may, for it is matter of daily and univer&s;al ob&s;er|vation, confirmed by experience,) that we are altogether depraved and polluted thro' &s;in, in&s;omuch that <HI>every im|agination of the thoughts of our hearts is only evil, and that continually:</HI> from which corrupt fountain the mo&s;t per|nicious &s;treams are perpetually flowing; &s;o that we are
<PB N="39" REF="031758_0039_0FEE3180794A61C0">earthly, &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h, all our tempers, words, and works being in direct oppo&s;ition to the law of God. &mdash;But then, notwith&s;tanding, yea <HI>becau&s;e</HI> of this depra|vity and ruin of our once pure and perfect nature, and, with a view to its removal, it informs us that as Chri&s;t <HI>died for our &s;ins, and ro&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for our ju&s;tification,</HI> &s;o <HI>being exalted to the Father's right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, he hath received the promi&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> which he <HI>&s;heds forth abun|danily</HI> on the children of men, inviting all <HI>that thir&s;t,</HI> yea, and <HI>who&s;oever will,</HI> to come and partake of it.</P>
<P N="5">5. Now this &s;pirit is an univer&s;al remedy for all the di&s;orders of our fallen nature&mdash;Hereby the darkne&s;s is removed from our minds, and the hardne&s;s from our hearts; our under&s;tanding is enlightened, our will &s;ubdued, our a&s;&s;ections &s;et upon things above, and all our unholy tem|pers and corrupt inclinations purged away. Hereby we <HI>die unto &s;in,</HI> and <HI>live unto righteou&s;ne&s;s; put off the old man,</HI> and <HI>put on the new.</HI> By this, the divine nature is communicated to us, and the divine image &s;tampt upon us; we are transformed into the likene&s;s, and conformed to the will of God. Here wi&s;dom lights her lamp, and from hence love kindles her fire: This feeds the flames of devotion, and without this, prayer and prai&s;e are cold and languid. By this, the li&s;e of God is opened in the &s;oul, and the kingdom of God &s;et up in the heart. Be|ing joined to the Lord, we become one &s;pirit with him, and we dwell in him and he in us. In a word, heaven is brought down upon earth, and an earne&s;t of our future inheritance is given us, until the full redemption of the purcha&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="40" REF="031758_0040_0FEE313A490109D8">
6. But be it ob&s;erved, tho' this &s;pirit more or le&s;s en|lightens and &s;trives with all, (as appears not only from &s;cripture, but al&s;o from experience, all men, the mo&s;t abandoned not excepted, having, at one time or another, felt &s;ome remor&s;e on account of &s;in, and &s;ome de&s;ire af|ter holine&s;s) yet in the&s;e his &s;aving influences, he is only imparted to tho&s;e who follow his drawings, and comply with his de&s;ign.

Accordingly, we are exhorted not to <HI>grieve</HI> or <HI>quench</HI> the holy &s;pirit of God, by oppo&s;ing his work; but, on the contrary, working with him <HI>to mortify the deeds of the body, that we may live.</HI> And <HI>living in the &s;pirit,</HI> we are further directed to <HI>walk in the &s;pirit,</HI> that is, to &s;uffer our&s;elves to be led by him into all truth, holine&s;s, and happine&s;s, that we may bring forth all his ble&s;&s;ed fruits, and abound in every holy temper, word and work.&mdash; And this is the very thing implied in <HI>obeying the go&s;pel</HI> in this &s;econd view of it, as it is a <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation of the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Thus &s;hall we be obedient to the go&s;pel in every other re&s;pect.

<Q><BIBL>2. THESS. i. 7, 8, 9.</BIBL>
<P><HI>The Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. IT is remarkable, that in the account here given us, by the Apo&s;tle, of the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the eternally awful con&s;equences of it, he repre&s;ents our Lord's &s;econd coming to be rather in order to the &s;alva|tion of his own people, than the puni&s;hment of the wicked. For tho' he mentions his taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the go&s;pel, yet it &s;eems this &s;hall be done, as it were, by the by, &s;ince (as he declares in the 10th ver&s;e) the end, the <HI>principal end</HI> of his coming is, that he <HI>may be glorified in his &s;aints, and admired of all that believe.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. How plain is it from hence, as well as from a thou&s;and other con&s;iderations, that mercy is our Lord's darling attribute, and that judgment is his &s;trange work. He delights to di&s;pen&s;e pardons and confer rewards; but it is with reluctance that he pa&s;&s;es &s;entence of con|demnation,
<PB N="45" REF="031758_0045_0FEE2F005BC8CEE8">or inflicts puni&s;hment on any. From the Apo&s;tle's manner of repre&s;enting the matter, one would conclude that he would much rather pa&s;s the poor wretch|es by, did not the unchangeable perfections of his na|ture, the divine authority of his laws, and the unalter|able rights of his government, oblige him to take no|tice of them. But ina&s;much as all his other attributes mu&s;t be manife&s;ted and honoured, as well as his love, his law magnified, and the equity of his government main|tained; therefore he mu&s;t and will <HI>render to every man according to his works: to them who, by patient continu|ance in well doing, &s;eek for glory, honour, and immortali|ty, eternal life; but to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h upon every &s;oul of man who worketh evil, of the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o of the Gentile, for there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons with God.</HI> As certainly as he will account his &s;aints <HI>worthy</HI> through the worthi|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, <HI>of the kingdom for which they &s;uffer,</HI> &s;o certainly, <HI>when he is revealed, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, will</HI> he <HI>take vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>In two former di&s;cour&s;es on the&s;e words, the <HI>certainty</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of our Lord's &s;econd coming, as al&s;o the <HI>character</HI> of tho&s;e he will then condemn, have been par|ticularly con&s;idered. I now proceed, as was propo&s;ed, to &s;hew</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>duration</HI> of their mi&s;ery. But that we may ju&s;tify the ways of God to man, and pre|vent any abu&s;e which might be made of this doctrine to the di&s;paragement of the divine goodne&s;s, I think it
<PB N="46" REF="031758_0046_0FEE31445DD34CB8">proper to premi&s;e a few words concerning the rea&s;on of their condemnation and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="1">1. This is &s;ignified in the words of our text which &s;peak of Chri&s;t's "taking vengeance on them," and "pun|i&s;hing them."

1. The Apo&s;tle calls their mi&s;ery <HI>de&s;truction,</HI> by which 'tis plain he does not mean "the extinction of their be|ing," or "the annihilation of their nature," becau&s;e this &s;en&s;e of the word is contrary to the general tenor of the &s;criptures, which repre&s;ent the wicked as not only exi&s;ting after the day of judgment, but as &s;uffering the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torture. But by this expre&s;&s;ion we are plainly to under&s;tand what is infinitely wor&s;e than anni|hilation, viz. 1&s;t, The utter ruin of their once holy and happy nature, with the final death of all their comforts and their hopes; and 2dly, The entire perver&s;ion of all their powers and faculties, which are now only em|ployed in rendering them&s;elves mo&s;t completely wretched.

<P N="2">2. Their de&s;truction is &s;aid to be <HI>from the pre&s;ence of the Lord.</HI> This intimates to us what is the chief &s;ource of their ruin and mi&s;ery, viz. their bani&s;hment from the gracious pre&s;ence of God, their exclu&s;ion from his favor and fellow&s;hip.&mdash;In con&s;equence of original &s;in, and be|cau&s;e they rejected the garments of &s;alvation, provided by Chri&s;t, and offered in the Go&s;pel, therefore they are found, at the day of judgment de&s;titute of the divine image, that &s;plendid and comely apparel which is the glory of the holy angels, and which was once the chief ornament and happine&s;s of man in his primeval &s;tate. The rotten and filthy rags of their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which they had taken pains to patch together and throw over their &s;inful &s;ouls, only &s;erve to increa&s;e their deformi|ty,

<P N="3">3. They are, therefore, objects of divine di&s;appro|bation and abhorrence. <HI>The God who made them will not have mercy on them, and be who formed them will &s;hew them no favour.</HI> They are excluded the favor of Jehovah, which is better than life, which diffu&s;es light and joy thro' the happy regions of immortality, and bani&s;hes every &s;hadow of evil far from their peaceful dwellings.

<P N="5">5. But this phra&s;e&mdash;<HI>de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord,</HI> may be al&s;o under&s;tood in another &s;en&s;e.

For as it is the pre|&s;ence of God in his <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> which diffu&s;es light and joy through the happy regions of immortality, &s;o it is the pre&s;ence of God in his <HI>vengeance,</HI> which &s;catters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and woe thro' the dreary realms of mi&s;e|ry.

His fiery indignation <HI>kindles,</HI> and his in|cen&s;ed fury <HI>blows</HI> the flames of their torment, while his powerful pre&s;ence and operation maintains their <HI>being,</HI> and renders all their powers mo&s;t acutely &s;en&s;ible; thus &s;etting the keene&s;t edge upon their pain, and making it cut mo&s;t intolerably deep!</P>
<P N="6">6. Nay further: it &s;eems implied in the next expre&s;|&s;ion in our text, <HI>from the glory of his power,</HI> that he will exert all his divine attributes to the utmo&s;t, to make them as wretched as the capacity of their nature will ad|mit. He will e&s;pecially glorify his <HI>power,</HI> and render it illu&s;trious in their damnation.&mdash;Gladly would be have glorified his rich grace in pardening their complicated guilt, and his almighty power in re&s;toring them to his image, that they might have been rai&s;ed to a &s;hare in his throne: But de&s;pi&s;ing his great &s;alvation, they would not come unto Chri&s;t that they might have life. And now, nothing remains but that he glorify him&s;elf in their mi&s;ery, &s;ince they refu&s;ed that happine&s;s which he would have conferred upon them, to the manife&s;tation of his own glory. For he mu&s;t and will be glorified one way or another in all his creatures; and with re&s;pect to the&s;e ungrateful and di&s;obedient wretches, he has but one way left in which he can be glorified, and that is, to reward them according to their works, by recompen&s;ing
<PB N="55" REF="031758_0055_0FEE31F5DE496330">their ingratitude and di&s;obedience upon their own guilty heads.</P>
<P N="7">7.

Surely as the condition of the &s;aints mu&s;t be inconceivably joyful, in whom God will <HI>make known</HI> (as the Apo&s;tle has it) <HI>the riches of his glory,</HI> i. e. di&s;play how gloriou&s;ly rich he is in goodne&s;s, and to what a pitch of honour and happine&s;s his omnipotence can rai&s;e the objects of his love! &s;o, on the other hand, the &s;tate of the&s;e wretches mu&s;t be equally lamentable! Unhappy creatures! from what an height of glory and felicity, into what a depth of infamy and mi&s;ery have they knowingly and wilfully plunged them&s;elves! And now

<L>"They Yuffer &s;till, and &s;till they are renewed."</L></Q></P>
<P N="8">8. For the Apo&s;tle tells us, their de&s;truction will be <HI>eternal;</HI> a declaration which is confirm'd by many other
<PB N="56" REF="031758_0056_0FEE31AE87CF3CB0">pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture. One or two I &s;hall now produce as a &s;pecimen of the re&s;t. Thus Daniel a&s;&s;ures us: <HI>They &s;hall</HI> (viz. at the general re&s;urrection) <HI>awake to everla&s;ting &s;hame and contempt,</HI> even as the &s;aints &s;hall ari&s;e <HI>to everla&s;ting life: they &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment,</HI> &s;ays the faithful and true witne&s;s, even as <HI>the righteous &s;hall go in|to life eternal.</HI> And indeed the eternity of their mi&s;ery &s;eems a natural con&s;equence of what has been advanced in the two la&s;t paragraphs. For if God will di&s;play in them (as has been ob&s;erved) the <HI>infinity</HI> of his ju&s;tice, the <HI>&s;everity</HI> of his wrath, and the <HI>omnipotence</HI> of his power, then mu&s;t their puni&s;hment be everla&s;ting, becau&s;e their nature being finite, it does not appear how he can do this in any limited duration of time, however long. And thus what is wanting in the <HI>degree</HI> of their mi&s;ery, is made up by its <HI>continuance.</HI> And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, among others, we conclude, the happine&s;s of the righteous &s;hall be <HI>eternal,</HI> becau&s;e in them God will manife&s;t the infinite riches of his love and goodne&s;s, which con&s;idering the fi|nite capacity of their nature, he cannot do in le&s;s than a boundle&s;s eternity.</P>
<P N="9">9. If need were, I might add in confirmation of this doctrine, di&s;puted by few, that as the holine&s;s and obe|dience of the &s;aints, &s;till continue and encrea&s;e in heaven, and therefore there mu&s;t be the &s;ame and greater rea&s;on for their being rewarded with bli&s;s and glory, when they have been millions of ages in happine&s;s, than when they fir&s;t entered the gates of Paradi&s;e; &s;o, the depravity and di&s;obedience of the wicked &s;till continuing and encrea|&s;ing, there mu&s;t be the very &s;ame, yea, and greater rea&s;on for their puni&s;hment, when they have been millions of ages
<PB N="57" REF="031758_0057_0FEE31F771769518">in torment, than when they fir&s;t departed accur&s;ed into <HI>everla&s;ting fire!</HI> They mu&s;t be perpetually &s;welling their enormous &s;um of guilt, and &s;till running deeper, immen&s;e|ly deeper in debt to divine and infinite ju&s;tice; God ha|ving as much right to, and as certainly claiming their obe|dience in hell, as the obedience of his &s;aints in heaven. For it is, in the nature of things, impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould di&s;pen&s;e with the allegiance of any of his creatures.&mdash; Hence, after the longe&s;t imaginable period, they will be &s;o far from having di&s;charged their debt of puni&s;hment, that they will find more, infinitely <HI>more</HI> due than when they fir&s;t began to &s;uffer! Dreadful this indeed! but too true!</P>
<P N="10">10. Indeed, the compari&s;on drawn from the happine&s;s of the &s;aints, is not altogether &s;uitable; but alas! the impropriety of it falls on the unfavourable &s;ide, and only &s;trengthens my argument the more. For whatever proofs may be brought from other quarters in favour of the eternity of their bli&s;s, which do not equally evince the eternal mi&s;ery of the wicked; yet, in this point of view (&s;ure I am) more may be &s;aid for the latter than the former. For the righteous, however obedient, do no more than is their duty to do, and therefore (&s;trictly &s;peaking) <HI>merit</HI> nothing at the hand of God. They can make no claim upon his <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> but all their hopes of happine&s;s and a continuance therein, are founded upon his gracious promi&s;es, which he was free to make or not to make, as he thought good.&mdash;But the ca&s;e is different with the wicked; they have <HI>&s;trictly</HI> and <HI>properly merited</HI> or <HI>de&s;erved</HI> eternal puni&s;hment, and are, in fact, obnoxi|ous to it. And hence their apprehen&s;ions of it are found|ed,
<PB N="58" REF="031758_0058_0FEE31B02091AD50">not barely on his threatenings, but al&s;o and chiefly on the unchangeable perfections of his nature.&mdash;So that it appears, if this rea&s;oning is ju&s;t, they have more than double that cau&s;e for fearing an <HI>eternal</HI> hell, which the &s;aints have for expecting an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> heaven!</P>

<P>But it would be needle&s;s, had I both time and inclina|tion for it, to enter upon the formal and particular proof of a doctrine which you do not di&s;believe, and therefore I forbear to enlarge on this head.

<P N="1">1. HOW infallibly certain, and how a&s;toni&s;hingly grand and &s;triking, are the events pre&s;ented to our view by the Apo&s;tle in this alarming pa&s;&s;age of holy writ! How well worthy the &s;erious attention and devout con|templation of all who love the appearing of our Lord

<P N="2">2. The revolutions which are continually happening in the petty &s;tates and fluctuating affairs of this world; the acce&s;&s;ion of temporal princes to their tran&s;itory dig|nities and corruptible crowns; the poor and in&s;ignificant conque&s;ts obtained by worms of the earth over their fel|low-reptiles; the approach of earthly judges, and the trial, condemnation, and puni&s;hment of the violators of human laws, <HI>the&s;e</HI> are events which &s;hort-fighted mortals deem of con&s;equence enough to occupy their thoughts in private, to employ their tongues in conver&s;ation, and to dignify the annals of hi&s;tory. They <HI>think,</HI> they <HI>talk,</HI> they <HI>write</HI> of the&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the mean time, the grand revolution of univer|&s;al nature; the glorious exaltation of the Prince of the kings of the earth; his compleat and everla&s;ting triumph over principalities and powers, and all the potent enemies of his government; the coming of the final Judge of angels and of men; the deci&s;ive trial of the whole world at his bar; and the infinite and eternal rewards and pun|i&s;hments then to be di&s;pen&s;ed to immortal &s;ouls, united to incorruptible bodies;&mdash;the&s;e &s;ubjects, though inter|e&s;ting beyond thought, and grand beyond compari&s;on, are, alas! too generally treated with indifference and neg|lect!

<P N="4">4. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, that the&s;e &s;oul-exalting and heart|improving &s;ubjects have any place left whither to retire! Ble&s;&s;ed be God, that they are not yet quite bani&s;hed out of the world! They are &s;till (thanks to Divine Provi|dence!) allowed to remain in our Bibles, and now and then (though not often) to a&s;cend the pulpit, and give &s;erious in&s;tructions to a few of the poor and illiterate, who are not yet arrived to &s;uch a pitch of refinement as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> think it beneath them to attend their lectures. But who knows how &s;oon they will be forced from this their la&s;t retreat? Who knows how &s;oon this jovial and licen|tious age, will forbid us to mention death and judgment, heaven and hell, even in the pulpit, and confine us to di&s;cour&s;e on &s;ubjects which have le&s;s tendency to alarm their &s;ears, and make their minds unea&s;y? However, as this is not yet the ca&s;e, let us not neglect to improve the liberty wherewith we are indulged, and in pur&s;uance of our &s;ubject, let us as was propo&s;ed in our la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e,</P>
<P>Secondly, Take a more particular view of the nature and duration of the mi&s;ery of the wicked, as proved and explained in the preceding Sermon.</P>
<P N="1">1. But here I coufe&s;s my mind recoils. I feel a &s;en|&s;ible reluctance to enter upon the con&s;ideration of &s;o dark and di&s;mal a &s;ubject; a &s;ubject which yet I believe very nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;idered, and not le&s;s profitable. For doubtle&s;s our Lord, and his Apo&s;tles, would never re|commend &s;uch painful meditations to us, if they were not needful, and calculated to yield us much fruit. To
<PB N="66" REF="031758_0066_0FEE31C15F356140">&s;ay nothing of their tendency to re&s;train us from &s;in and prompt us to duty, to excite us to diligence, and awaken our &s;leepy &s;ouls to watchful care and fearful circum&s;pec|tion; reflections upon that future and eternal mi&s;ery, which is re&s;erved for the impenitent and unbelieving &s;in|ner, and is the ju&s;t de&s;ert of us all, may be of great u&s;e to encrea&s;e our patience under all the afflictions and trou|bles of this life, &s;o light and momentary in compari&s;on of it. And, at the &s;ame time, to con&s;ider this mi&s;ery in contra&s;t with that exceeding great and eternal weight of glory, which is the free gift of God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, will tend to enlarge our conceptions of that great &s;alva|tion which Chri&s;t hath wrought out for us, and, of con|&s;equence, to endear the Saviour to us, to whom we owe our redemption from the cur&s;e of the law, and our deli|verance from the wrath to come.</P>
<P N="2">2. Away then with this reluctance! with this "fool|i&s;h, this treacherous compa&s;&s;ion," (as the benevolent and meek Doddridge calls it,) <Q>which chu&s;es rather to leave men to be con&s;umed, than di&s;turb their &s;lumbers.</Q> Let us &s;eriou&s;ly addre&s;s our&s;elves to the con&s;ideration of a &s;ubject which, tho' dreary and unpromi&s;ing in appear|ance, is notwith&s;tanding productive of much whole&s;ome fruit. Oh, that it may prove &s;uch to us all!&mdash;Sorry &s;hould I be, by di&s;cour&s;ing on this head, only to tor|ment &s;ome of you before the time; and yet, if you &s;e|riou&s;ly attend to what &s;hall be delivered, and after all &s;till re&s;olve to remain in your &s;ins, it cannot be expected to produce any other effect. If, therefore, that is your re&s;olution, if you are not di&s;po&s;ed to bid adieu to all ini|quity, and give your&s;elves up to the &s;ervice of God with|out

<P N="3">3. In the former di&s;cour&s;e on this &s;ubject, in which the text was explained and the doctrine e&s;tabli&s;hed, it was ob&s;erved, that the de&s;truction here &s;poken of, &s;ig|nified, 1&s;t, <Q>The utter ruin of their once holy and hap|py nature, and the final death of all their comforts and their hopes;</Q> and 2dly, <Q>the entire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ion of all their powers and faculties, which are n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w only employed in di&s;honouring God, and rendering them|&s;elves mo&s;t completely wretched.</Q></P>

<P N="1">1. Indeed their holine&s;s and happine&s;s was in reality lo&s;t in this world, tho' not irrecoverably.

But in|toxicated with the enchanting cup of plea&s;ure, and in the mid&s;t of their midnight &s;lumbers, tho' plunged in the filth of iniquity, and fa&s;t bound by gigantic lu&s;ts, they talked much of the purity of their nature, the free|dom of their will, and the light and liberty in which they walked.&mdash;Tho' the Devil's captives, confin'd by him in the pri&s;on of &s;in, bolted and barred by unbelief, and in the territories of hell; yet were they as ea&s;y and unconcerned, as if they imagined them&s;elves to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of all po&s;&s;ible honor and felicity.</P>
<P N="2">2. At times, indeed, the &s;tormy bla&s;t of adver&s;ity, the painful &s;mart of affliction, or the thunder of God's threatenings, di&s;turbed their repo&s;e, and almo&s;t awaken|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">py &s;ouls: but another draught of Satan's cup <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ying their &s;en&s;es, and the agreeable &s;ong of "Peace, peace," &s;ounding in their ears, lulled them to &s;leep again, while &s;in &s;ilently doubled their fetters and chains and unbelief, &s;topping up every avenue of divine light, added fre&s;h locks and bolts to their pri&s;on doors. &mdash;And now they &s;leep more &s;ecurely, and dream more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">adly than ever.&mdash;No &s;ooner do they end one dream than they begin another.

<P N="3">3. Then their &s;leeping and dreaming end together. They &s;uddenly awake to a mo&s;t keen and dreadful &s;en&s;e of the ruin of their nature, and the final death of all their comforts and their hopes.&mdash;They now feel in a man|ner words cannot de&s;cribe, from what an height of holi|ne&s;s and happine&s;s, into what a depth of guilt and mi|&s;ery they are fallen&mdash;De&s;titute of their maker's image, and confounded at the di&s;covery of their nakedne&s;s and deformity, they fly from the pre&s;ence of the light, and the &s;ight of &s;aints and angels, now intolerable; and o'er|whelmed with &s;hame and everla&s;ting contempt, &s;eek for refuge from the angui&s;h they &s;uffer under the &s;hades of infernal darkne&s;s. But alas! the flames of hell, though black and di&s;mal, afford light enough to demon&s;trate their folly and depravity, while the arrows of almighty indignation, prepared by inexorable ju&s;tice, and directed by unerring wi&s;dom, pur&s;ue and overtake them, and piercing them thro' with unknown &s;orrows, lay them low at the bottom of the fiery lake, which, fed with &s;treams of brim&s;tone, and blown by the breath of Jeho|vah, &s;wells, overflows, and torments their ruin'd &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="4">4. Their once holy and happy nature is now ruined, utterly and finally ruined, without any remedy, or the mo&s;t di&s;tant hope of recovery. Their frail ve&s;&s;els, tho' built of the be&s;t materials, yet corrupted by the worm of &s;in, being conveyed by the ebb of time, down the &s;mooth river of life, are now hurried, beyond the bar of death into the fiery and unfathomable &s;ea of divine wrath.

The <HI>imagination,</HI> freed from every clog, wherewith its motions were once impeded, when it was incumbered by fle&s;h and blood, being now rendered quick and active as a di&s;embodied &s;pirit, is perpetually traver&s;ing, with incredible &s;peed and unwearied diligence, the gloomy re|gions of Hell in que&s;t of woe. And having collected together every con&s;ideration of horror, it cloaths them all in the mo&s;t hideous forms, and thereby keeps the poor affrighted &s;oul in continual terror and di&s;may.&mdash; The <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> cleared of al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mi&s;ts of ignorance,
<PB N="72" REF="031758_0072_0FEE31CF61A31968">and fumes of prejudice, wherewith it was ob&s;cured in this world, and now di&s;cerning every thing in its true light, is ever unhappily bu&s;ied in comparing the joys of heaven with the torments of hell, and contra&s;ting the happine&s;s they have lo&s;t, with the mi&s;ery they have in|curred. It remon&s;trates, in terms which wound and pierce their inmo&s;t &s;ouls, upon their <HI>ingratitude, folly</HI> and <HI>perver&s;ene&s;s,</HI> in rejecting a felicity &s;o valuable in it&s;elf, &s;o dearly bought, and &s;o freely and repeatedly offered; while in contradiction to rea&s;on, to duty, and intere&s;t; again&s;t the cleare&s;t light and the greate&s;t love; notwith|&s;tanding the mo&s;t &s;olemn warnings and earne&s;t intreaties, the exhortations, prayers, tears, and blood of the Son of God him&s;elf, they <HI>knowingly</HI> and <HI>wilfully</HI> plunged in|to a depth of woe, from whence there is no redemption.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this work of torment, the under&s;tanding re|ceives no &s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the <HI>memory,</HI> now &s;trength|ened to an amazing degree. This faculty brings in re|view their whole life, and pre&s;ents to the active mind an endle&s;s variety of circum&s;tances, which only tend, like oil pour'd into the fire, to feed the flames of their mi|&s;ery, and make then burn with more unabating &s;ury.&mdash; It reminds them, on the one hand, of the many and un|de&s;erved mercies of a kind Creator, a patient Pre&s;erver and a gracious Redeemer, which might have warmed the colde&s;t brea&s;t with &s;ervant gratitude and love, and on the other, of the various and alarming judgments executed by the righteous governor of the world, for the terror of evil doers, which might have broken in pieces the mo&s;t rocky and adamantine heart. But their brea&s;ts re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ined, after all, &s;till cold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ice, and their hearts hard
<PB N="73" REF="031758_0073_0FEE320C21CF49E8">as a nether mill&s;tone. It brings to their remembrance the &s;uperintending care of a kind and watchful <HI>Providence,</HI> which perpetually and wi&s;ely ordered all for their good, removed their hindrances, afforded them helps, and put them in the mo&s;t favourable circum&s;tances for their re&s;|toration. But they perver&s;ely, by a diabolical &s;kill in &s;piritual chemi&s;try, extracted a bitter out of every &s;weet, turned their helps into hindrances and their good into evil!</P>
<P N="3">3. By the help of the memory they recollect the ma|ny free and gracious offers of reconcilation which were made them by the Amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, accompanied with repeated and pre&s;&s;ing invitations, to accept tho&s;e offers and faithful warnings of approaching mi&s;ery if they neglected them. They remember how all the&s;e were, time after time, attended by the influences of the &s;pirit, di&s;po&s;ing their minds to con&s;ider and improve them. At times they were inclined to comply, and al|mo&s;t per&s;uaded to be Chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially when an alarming providence, cut off by a &s;udden and unexpect|ed &s;troke, &s;ome relation or dear friend, or laid an heavy hand of affliction upon them&s;elves; But alas! &s;ome hurry of idle bu&s;ine&s;s occupied their minds, &s;ome phantom of empty applau&s;e engaged their pur&s;uit, &s;ome intoxicating draught of the cup of plea&s;ure, unhappily taken, drown|ed their convictions, or &s;ome frothy company or vain amu&s;ement, diverted the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> attention from the one thing needful! And thus they have forever lo&s;t that <HI>exceeding great and eternal weight of glory,</HI> which they had once &s;o fair an opportunity of attaining, and &s;unk into an unfa|thomable
<PB N="74" REF="031758_0074_0FEE31D9F65D7330">depth of woe, out of which there is no deliv|erance!</P>
<P N="4">4. In the mean time <HI>con&s;cience</HI> is not idle. Once in|deed
<Q><L>"She &s;eem'd to &s;leep</L>

<L>"On headlong appetite the &s;lacken'd rein,</L>
<L>"And gave them up to licence unrecall'd."</L></Q> But it was all deceit. Even then &s;he regi&s;tered all their thoughts, and words, and works, and kept a faithful and circum&s;tantial account of their whole conduct. No temper of mind, no action of life e&s;caped her ob&s;erva|tion; but

<P N="5">5. They are now obliged to hearken, however reluc|tant, to the tormenting hi&s;tory which <HI>con&s;cience</HI> minutely gives them, of the fabbaths they have broken, the or|dinances they have profaned, the oaths they have &s;wore, the lies they have told, the acts of uncleanne&s;s, intem|perance, fraud, and oppre&s;&s;ion they have committed, the mercies they have abu&s;ed, the judgments they have &s;lighted. She gives them a partioular detail of all the in&s;tances of their ingratitude and di&s;obedience to him, who was at once their mo&s;t indulgent parent and bounti|ful
<PB N="75" REF="031758_0075_0FEE2EF9174CD418">benefactor; and enlarges much upon their <HI>hypocrify</HI> before an heart-&s;earching God, their formality in the wor&s;hip of him who is a &s;pirit, and their lukewarmne&s;s in the pur&s;uit of immortal honour and eternal gain. In &s;hort, this long-neglected, and now implacably revenge|ful power, perpetually holds out to their view the gla&s;s of God's holy law, which confounds and torments them with the di&s;covery of their filthine&s;s and deformity. Look which way they will their &s;ins, the children of their folly, &s;ummoned by <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> in all their number and aggravations, dre&s;t in the mo&s;t frightful forms, and armed with the mo&s;t dreadful in&s;truments of torture, &s;tare them in the face with looks of vengeance, and fly upon them with in&s;atiable fury. Thus like an infernal fiend, &s;he la&s;hes their &s;ouls with whips and &s;corpions, while as a worm &s;he gnaws and con&s;umes their inwards, or like an hungry vulture preys upon and devours their undecaying vitals.</P>
<P N="6">6. And if the <HI>rational</HI> faculties, the mo&s;t noble of our nature, are thus bu&s;y in executing upon them the in|dignation and wrath of an offended God, for their de|pravation and abu&s;e of tho&s;e faculties, &s;urely the inferior powers, which are but &s;ervants to the &s;uperior, will not be &s;uffered to remain unemployed.&mdash;The <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> have a con&s;iderable &s;hare in this work of vengeance a&s;&s;igned them, and that ju&s;tly, for they bear a chief part in &s;oli|citing man to &s;in. Indeed, &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ions, which imply happine&s;s in their very nature, &s;uch as <HI>e&s;teem,</HI> and <HI>hope,</HI> and <HI>joy,</HI> never vi&s;it the&s;e dreary regions, but take up their abode in purer climes, and under the influence of a milder &s;ky. But all tho&s;e which &s;in hath debauch|ed
<PB N="76" REF="031758_0076_0FEE31DB90078BD0">and made pregnant with woe, are bani&s;hed to the&s;e inho&s;pitable realms, far from the dwellings of light and liberty, where they are continually employed in digging deep into mines of mi&s;ery, and forming of helli&s;h metal in&s;truments of puni&s;hment, wherewith to torture dama|ed &s;pirits.</P>
<P N="7">7. Thus tho&s;e unhappy creatures feel in&s;atiable <HI>de|&s;ires</HI> after objects infinitely and eternally removed from them, while to objects ever pre&s;ent and before them, they have an infinite <HI>hatred</HI> and an unconquerable <HI>aver|&s;ion.</HI> A deluge of remedile&s;s <HI>&s;orrow</HI> perpetually over|whelms them on account of the torment they already &s;uffer; but as if they &s;uffered nothing in compari&s;on of what was yet to come, they are ever terrified with the mo&s;t dreadful <HI>fear</HI> of unknown waves of woe, which they &s;ee continually ri&s;ing in tremendous mountains, one behind another, and ready to bur&s;t upon their hopele&s;s &s;oul with a fre&s;h flood of affliction!</P>
<P N="8">8. And, ah! what they &s;uffer from the mortification of their <HI>pride,</HI> and the everla&s;ting &s;hame and contempt wherewith they are loaded! Proud as Lucifer, they deem them&s;elves worthy of the highe&s;t dignity, when be|hold! they are &s;unk to the lowe&s;t point of degradation, and only noticed to be hi&s;&s;ed and de&s;pi&s;ed. Hence they fret, rave, and tear; they &s;well with re&s;entment and rage towards God and one another. The rancour which boils in their brea&s;ts vents it&s;elf in revengeful looks, hor|rid imprecations, and impotent efforts of di&s;appointed cruelty. <HI>Di&s;content,</HI> re&s;tle&s;s and impatient; <HI>anger,</HI> loud and boi&s;terous; <HI>envy,</HI> pale and gha&s;tly; <HI>malice,</HI> impla|cable and fierce; In &s;hort, all the pa&s;&s;ions (capable of

Such is

<P N="9">9. What hath hitherto been &s;aid, refers only to the mi&s;ery ari&s;ing from the abu&s;ed and corrupted faculties of their <HI>&s;ouls;</HI> but I mu&s;t not forget to mention, on this occa&s;ion, the &s;ufferings peculiar to the <HI>bodies,</HI> wherewith the wicked will be puni&s;hed at the morning of the re&s;ur|rection.&mdash;And here, to &s;ay nothing of that &s;iery lake, to the bottom of which they will be chained by de&s;pi&s;|ed mercy, converted into inexorable wrath, and which &s;urrounds their whole body with its &s;corching flames, and in&s;inuates it&s;elf <HI>like water into their bowels, and like oil into their bones:</HI> All their <HI>&s;en&s;es,</HI> which were formerly excitements to lu&s;ts and inlets to &s;in, together with all their <HI>members,</HI> employed on earth as in&s;truments of ini|quity, are now, by the appointment of in&s;inite ju&s;tice, become inlets to mi&s;ery, and in&s;truments of puni&s;h|ment. Their <HI>eyes,</HI> accu&s;tomed to behold &s;cenes of plea&s;ure and objects of delight, are now terrified with the &s;ight of hideous forms and frightful &s;hapes.

For as to their mi&s;ery it&s;elf, &s;o far have I been, while attempting to de&s;cribe it, from dipping my pencil in too deep colours, that the whole creation affords none deep enough to repre&s;ent a thou&s;andth part of its greatne&s;s.
