<HEAD>A DOOR OPENED FOR CHRISTIAN LIBERTY.</HEAD>
<P>THE return of PEACE to the nations, and to this land in particular, with its circum|&s;tances and privileges, is a very great event indeed; which calls loudly to all for gratitude and thankfulne&s;s, to be manife&s;ted by a wife improve|ment of the favours granted us, and a faithful di&s;|charge of duty in our &s;everal &s;tations. And as con|tentions about religious liberty have cau&s;ed much difficulty among our&s;elves, whereby our enemies hop|ed to have got advantage again&s;t us, it may be of public benefit to lay open the pro&s;pect we now have of their being happily terminated.</P>
<P>The ea&s;t pari&s;h in Attleborough, &s;uppo&s;ing that our laws about wor&s;hip were the &s;ame as formerly, taxed and made di&s;tre&s;s upon &s;everal per&s;ons, for the &s;upport of their wor&s;hip, who did not attend thereon.
<PB N="4" REF="017824_0004_0FA319BF85FF2418">One of them thought proper to try how our laws now are in that re&s;pect; and for that end &s;ued their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ors before a ju&s;tice of peace in Norton, February 22, 1782; when and where he fully proved, that he had u&s;ually attended public wor&s;hip with the fir&s;t bapti&s;t church in Attleborough, ever &s;ince May 1780, and had communicated to its &s;upport to their &s;atisfaction. Yet judgment was given again&s;t him; from which he appealed to the county court at Taunton. And it being a matter of great importance, to have points of law well defined and &s;ettled under our new con&s;tituti|on of government, both parties agreed to have the ca&s;e tried by the honorable ju&s;tices of the court; namely, Walter Spooner, Thomas Durfee, Benjamin Williams, and William Baylies, E&s;quires. The council for the appellant were the honourable William Bradford, and James-Mitchel Varnum, E&s;quires. For the appellees was the honorable Robert Treat Paine, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> attorney general for this Commonwealth.</P>
<P>The latter, when pleading for &s;aid pari&s;h, owned that religion mu&s;t at all times be a matter between God and individuals, and declared that he di&s;claimed all &s;ubordination of any one &s;ect to another: but pleaded, that the certificates, formerly required by law, were not tokens of &s;ubordination of one &s;ect to another, but of &s;ubordination to the government; and accu&s;ed the bapti&s;ts of refu&s;ing to be &s;ubordinate to government. He al&s;o pleaded, that the appellant was born in the &s;econd pari&s;h in Attleborough, was baptized there, and therefore was to all intents a member of that &s;o|ciety; &s;o that if he thought he had cau&s;e to leave thein, the law, rea&s;on, and even common civility, re|quired that he &s;hould give them notice of it, which he had not done.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017824_0005_0FA319C046D96718">
The chief pleas for the appellant were, that RELIGION was prior to all &s;tates and kingdoms in the world, and therefore could not in its nature be &s;ubject to human laws; that the certificates heretofore required, were giv|en to pari&s;h officers, officers of one particular &s;ect, and not to officers of government; and as our con&s;titution &s;ays, <Q>No &s;ubordination of any one &s;ect or denomi|nation to another, &s;hall ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law,</Q> tho&s;e laws are repealed thereby. And as the con&s;ti|tution was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the people, it is &s;tronger than any law the a&s;&s;embly can make, it being the foundation whereon they &s;tand. Al&s;o the &s;ociety to which the appellant joined, is as regular a &s;ociety as the other that taxed him.</P>
<P>The&s;e points were learnedly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, on March 16, 1782; after which the ju&s;tices retired a little by them&s;elves, and then returned, and declared, <Q>that they were unanimou&s;ly agreed in giving the appel|lant damages and co&s;ts.</Q> Which judgment not only &s;ettled the controver&s;y in Attleborough, but has been exten&s;ively beneficial el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>As far as my memory and judgment &s;erve me, this is a fair repre&s;entation of tho&s;e tran&s;actions; and if any can &s;et them in a more ju&s;t light, they are wel|come to do it. And &s;ince &s;ome in Attleborough ac|cu&s;ed the bapti&s;ts of great incon&s;i&s;tency, in prote&s;ting again&s;t the third article in our bill of rights, and yet now making u&s;e of it again&s;t them, I &s;hall take leave to make a few remarks upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is well known that on December 2, 1779, three months before the con&s;titution was fini&s;hed, as agent for our churches, I publi&s;hed that article in the independent chronicle, with exceptions again&s;t the power claimed therein; when I declared, that I <Q>fully
<PB N="6" REF="017824_0006_0FA319C106877A70">concurred</Q> with that part of it which we have now made u&s;e of; and none could tell how it would oper|ate but by experience.</P>
<P N="2">2. If natural birth, and the doings of others, could make a per&s;on a member of a religious &s;ociety, with|out his own con&s;ent, we &s;hould have no objection again&s;t the way of withdrawing from &s;uch a &s;ociety, that our opponants plead for. But &s;ince religion is ever a matter between God and individuals, how can any man become a member of a religious &s;ociety with|out his own con&s;ent? And how can a man who be|lieves it to be impo&s;&s;ible, practically &s;ay, that it is po&s;&s;ible, without contracting guilt to his con&s;cience? This is the exact &s;tate of our controver&s;y about reli|gious liberty. We have been very far from perfecti|on in our behaviour therein; but we have not been accu&s;ed of di&s;obedience to government, and of di&s;turb|ing the public peace, becau&s;e of our ever invading the rights of others; but only becau&s;e we will not give up our own. It is becau&s;e we have cho&s;en &s;ufferings, rather than to &s;in again&s;t God. We believe that at|tendence upon public wor&s;hip, and keeping the fir&s;t day of the week holy to God, are duties to be incul|cated and enforced by his laws, in&s;tead of the laws of men; but we have had no controver&s;y with our rulers about that matter. The town of Bo&s;ton mu&s;t now look at home, for a want of &s;ubordination to go|vernment in that re&s;pect.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A law about the&s;e things was made here la&s;t fall, which, after repeated meetings, is not obeyed by this town.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="017824_0007_0FA319C1C3CA0050">
3. The fir&s;t, and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential article in the order of Chri&s;t's kingdom, is that no man <HI>can &s;ee it,</HI> nor have any right to <HI>power</HI> therein, until he is <HI>born again.</HI> John i. 12, 13. iii. 3. And the fathers of the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ett government paid &s;uch a regard to this truth, that, during their fir&s;t charter, none were admitted to full communion in their churches, nor to govern in the choice and &s;upport of mini&s;ters, without a credi|ble profe&s;&s;ion of that great change. And their ex|cluding of all others from a vote in civil government, and yet compelling of them to attend and &s;upport their wor&s;hip, gave the mo&s;t plau&s;able handle that the Briti&s;h court ever had, to rob us of the &s;tipulated privilege of choo&s;ing our own governors, while they demanded our property to &s;upport governers arbitra|rily &s;et over us. And contentions upon this point was the root of the late bloody war, which has co&s;t a multitude of lives, and involved both countries amazingly in debt. Yet many are &s;till attached to the errors of our fathers, while they are re&s;olutely &s;et again&s;t their virtues.</P>
<P>After a glorious reformation, the fir&s;t church in Middleborough, were bereaved of their beloved pa&s;tor, in April 1744. The church then con&s;i&s;ted of above an hundred male communicants; but after they had voted to hear Mr. Silvanus Conant four &s;abbaths upon probation, the pari&s;h committee went and got another mini&s;ter to &s;upply the pul|pit the &s;ame days. And a council of &s;ix mini|&s;ters, approved of their &s;o doing, and advi&s;ed them to per&s;i&s;t in that way. By this means the &s;ociety was divided; and a pa&s;tor cho&s;en by three quarters of the church, and who proved to be one of the be&s;t mini&s;ters in the county, had no
<PB N="8" REF="017824_0008_0FA319C283ACEB00">better place than a barn to preach in, till they built a new meeting hou&s;e for him. The mini|&s;ters who <HI>cau&s;ed that divi&s;ion,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom xvi. 17.</NOTE> belonged to Scituate, Hingham, Hanover, Pembroke, and Bridgewater. And the &s;etting up of the world to govern the church about &s;oul-guides, was the evident cau&s;e of the following prophane, cruel, and &s;candelous actions.</P>
<P>Mr. Richard Lee, a gifted member of one of our churches, having laboured with &s;ucce&s;s in Scituate, was earne&s;tly reque&s;ted by a man in Hingham, to come and hold a meeting at his hou&s;e, which he con&s;ented to. The meeting was appointed to be in the evening of May 28, 1782; but as the people were a&s;&s;embling for wor&s;hip, a large mob came up, armed with clubs and &s;taves, and warned Lee and his friends to depart out of Hingham immediately, or it would be much wor&s;e for them. He enquired whether they came with any authority? and finding that they did not, he, with the bible in his hand, began to exhort the people to fear God rather than man. Upon which one of them violently &s;eized him by his arm and collar, and others al&s;o laying hold of him, halled him away out of the hou&s;e, and out of the town. When he attempted to &s;peak, and to recite pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, they repeatedly &s;mote him on his mouth, with the palms of their hands, and al&s;o made loud noi&s;es to prevent his being heard. As one who had hold or him blundered down, and another &s;hook
<PB N="9" REF="017824_0009_0FA319C344228478">a club over his head, and &s;wore that if he &s;lung ano|ther down, he would &s;ink Lee to hell in a moment. He then &s;aid, <Q>I look upon this holy bible to be the very be&s;t law that ever I heard of.</Q> Upon which it was &s;pitefully &s;truck out of his hand, and &s;tamped under foot, with cur&s;es and execrations too horrid to be here repeated! When the mob had got him over the town line, their captain &s;hook a club over Lee's head, and &s;wore, that if he ever came into that town again, he would tie him up, and whip him thirty &s;tripes. Said our &s;uffering brother, <Q>that's not &s;o much as they whipt Paul.</Q> <HI>What! d&mdash;n you,</HI> &s;aid one, <HI>do you compare your&s;elf with Paul!</HI> A Hingham man &s;aid, Mr. Lee may go and hold a meeting at my hou&s;e.&mdash;But others declared that if he did, they would burn his hou&s;e down, and carry him out of town. One of the mob ca&s;t &s;oft cow-dung in Lee's face, and then they in&s;ulted him becau&s;e of that defilement, with a great deal more of abu&s;e to men, and bla&s;phe|my again&s;t God. Two other bapti&s;t brethren were then hauled by violence out of Hingham, and they went and held a religious meeting in Scituate the &s;ame night.</P>
<P>In the above actions they tore Mr. Lee's cloaths con&s;iderably, and al&s;o brui&s;ed and injured his body &s;o much that he was ill for &s;ome days, and then he returned home to Gloce&s;ter in the county of Provi|dence. In July I met him at Scituate, where we were credibly informed, that his &s;afety, and even his life, were &s;till threatened by tho&s;e rioters. We then went to Bo&s;ton to a&s;k advice; and many there as well as in the country, advi&s;ed him to pre&s;ent a com|plaint to the grand jury of Suffolk county, again&s;t tho&s;e rioters, as a nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;ecuring the
<PB N="10" REF="017824_0010_0FA319C4045B20A8">public peace, and the liberties of mankind. This was accordingly done, when the county court &s;at at Bo&s;ton in October. Thirteen men were named in the complaint, which was &s;upported by the te&s;timo|ny of eight witne&s;&s;es; and a warrant was granted again&s;t live of the rioters, four of whom were taken, and pleaded not guilty before the court; upon which their trial was appointed to be on January 14, 1783.</P>
<P>Snow, ice, and a very &s;harp air, cau&s;ed the travel|ing to be exceeding difficult; yet Mr. Lee travelled &s;eventy miles from his hou&s;e to Scituate, and, with other witne&s;&s;es, twenty-three more from thence to Bo&s;ton, at the appointed time. But after an expen|&s;ive attendance of two days, the ca&s;e was put off till April. And the ill treatment he then met with made him determine not to appear there again, without &s;omebody from a di&s;tance to &s;peak for him; and the event ju&s;tified this determination. For no &s;ooner did a lawyer from Providence appear for him in Bo&s;ton, on April 23d, than a propo&s;al was made to leave the whole affair to cho&s;en men to &s;ettle it. This was agreed too; and the gentlemen appointed met upon it in Bridgwater the 6th in&s;tant. But then the defend|ants could not bear to have their ca&s;e publicly open|ed; and Mr. Lee was prevailed with to &s;ettle the matter with them, upon their promi&s;ing to pay a &s;um far &s;hort of what many thought they ought to have done. So that none can ju&s;tly charge him with pro&s;ecuting them out of a revengeful &s;pirit, nor with taking all the advantages of them that the law would have given him. And their names are not omitted in this publication, out of any fear of not being able ful|ly to prove every article; but becau&s;e we could ex|po&s;e, and give proper warnings again&s;t &s;uch actions
<PB N="11" REF="017824_0011_0FA319C5323A0070">for the future, without mentioning their names; and we hope and pray for their repentance and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The fathers of this town and government mi&s;took the work of civil rulers &s;o much, as to imagine that they were to inflict corporal puni&s;hments upon men, as &s;inners again&s;t God, and not only for crimes again&s;t the community.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In I&s;rael God was their only lawgiver; and our fathers run in|to their error, by attempting to form a chri&s;tian common wealth, in imitation of the Theocracy of the Jews. The&s;e things I mention, not out of di&s;re&s;pect to them, but for our in&s;truction.</NOTE> They therefore bani&s;hed &s;everal per&s;ons upon pain of death for adultery, before they did any for here&s;y; and &s;ome were hanged here for adultry near twenty years before they hanged the quakers. But the Apo&s;tle has plainly taught the churches, to put away wicked per&s;ons out of their communion; and &s;ays upon it, <HI>Them that are with|out God judgeth.</HI> 1 Cor. v. 13. And in the parable of the tares of the field, our Lord has commanded his &s;ervants, to let the children of his kingdom, and the children of the wicked one, grow together in the world, till the end of it. Which divine laws have ever been violated by all tho&s;e who have confounded the government of the church and &s;tate together. On the one hand they have been deficient about, if they have not wholly neglected, go&s;pel di&s;cipline in the church; while they have ever invaded their neighbours rights in the &s;tate, under religious pretences. And for twelve or thirteen centuries, all colleges and places for &s;uperior <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">rning, were under the government of men, who a&s;&s;umed the power to lay religious bands upon children before they could choo&s;e for them&s;elves, and to enforce the &s;ame by the &s;word of the magi&s;trate all their days. But I congratulate my countrymen
<PB N="12" REF="017824_0012_0FA319C586F89778">upon the arrival of more agreeable times, and upon the pro&s;pect of a much greater reformation before us. For the following rea&s;ons convince me, that God has now &s;et before us an open door for equal chri&s;tian li|berty, which no man can &s;hut.</P>
<P N="1">1. Not only America, but all the kingdoms and &s;tates of Europe, who have acknowledged the authori|ty of our Congre&s;s, have &s;et their &s;eal to this truth, that the highe&s;t civil rulers derive their power from the con&s;ent of the people, and cannot &s;tand without their &s;upport. And common people know, that no|thing is more contrary to the rules of hone&s;ty, than for &s;ome to attempt to convey to others things which they have no right to them&s;elves; and no one has any right to judge for others in religious affairs.</P>
<P N="2">2. All former taxes to &s;upport wor&s;hip, were im|po&s;ed in each government by a particular &s;ect, who held all others in &s;ubordination thereto; which parti|ality is now expre&s;&s;ly excluded from among us.</P>
<P N="3">3. No man can take a feat in our legi&s;lature, till he &s;olemnly declares, <Q>I believe the chri&s;tian religion, and have a firm per&s;ua&s;ion of its truth.</Q> And as &s;urely as it is true, Chri&s;t is the only HEAD of his church, and &s;he is COMPLETE in him, and is re|quired to do all her acts IN HIS NAME; and all wor&s;hip of a contrary nature, is <HI>will wor&s;hip,</HI> and is only to <HI>&s;atisfy the fle&s;h.</HI> Col. ii. 10, 19&mdash;23. iii. 17. And all mini&s;ters who were &s;upported by tax and com|pul&s;ion among us before the late war, received that power in the name of the king of Great Britain, and not King Je&s;us; and they are the only officers in this land, that have retained the power over the people, which they have received in that name. Whatever gifts and graces any of them have received from Je&s;us
<PB N="13" REF="017824_0013_0FA319C645767BB8">Chri&s;t, let them faithfully improve the &s;ame according to his direction; but, as they would appear loyal to him, or friends to their country, let them renounce the holding of any earthly head to the church.</P>
<P N="4">4. If this be not done, none can tell who they will have for their head. For the name prote&s;tant is no longer to be a te&s;t of our legi&s;lators; and to pur&s;uade the people to yield thereto, the compilers of the con|&s;titution &s;aid to them, <Q>your delegates did not con|ceive them&s;elves to be ve&s;ted with power to &s;et up one denomination of chri&s;tians above another; for religion mu&s;t at all times be a matter between God and individuals.</Q> This is a great truth; and it proves, that no man can become a member of a truly religious &s;ociety without his own con&s;ent; and al&s;o that no corporation that is not a religious &s;ociety can have a right to govern in religious matters. Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>who made me a judge, or a divider over you?</HI> And Paul &s;aid, <HI>what have I to do to judge them al&s;o that are without?</HI> Luke xii. 14. 1 Cor. v. 12. Thus our di|vine Lord, and the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, ex|plicitly renounced any judicial power over the world by virtue of their religion. And to imagine that <HI>money</HI> can give any <HI>power</HI> in religious matters, is the doctrine of Simon the <HI>&s;orcerer;</HI> and by &s;uch <HI>&s;orceries</HI> the whore of Babylon hath <HI>deceived all nations.</HI> Acts viii. 18, 19. Rev. xviii. 23. It was from thence that the Pope, on May 4, 1493, the year after Ameri|ca was fir&s;t di&s;covered, pre&s;umed to give away the lands of the heathen therein. And the &s;ame power was claimed by the crown of England, in granting &s;everal charters of this country; from whence &s;ome of
<PB N="14" REF="017824_0014_0FA319C707C08710">the &s;tates were lately contending in Congre&s;s with others, about the we&s;tern lands on this continent.</P>
<P N="5">5. All the power that the con&s;titution gives our legi&s;lature in this re&s;pect, is to make <Q>&s;uitable pro|vi&s;ion</Q> for chri&s;tian teachers; and, according to their declaration, divine revelation mu&s;t determine what is &s;uitable; and that determines that they <HI>&s;hall live of the go&s;pel.</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 14. Tho&s;e who under the law collected &s;upport for religious teachers <HI>by force,</HI> brought compleat de&s;truction upon them&s;elves there|for 1 Sam. ii. 16, 25. Micah iii. 5&mdash;12. Chri&s;tiani|ty is a voluntary obedience to God's revealed will; and every thing of a contrary nature is antichri&s;tiani&s;m. And all teachers who do not watch for &s;ouls as tho&s;e who mu&s;t give an account to God; and all people who do not receive and &s;upport his faithful mini&s;ters, as they have opportunity and ability, are daily expo&s;ed to puni&s;hments infinitely wor&s;e than men can inflict. Luke x. 3&mdash;12. Gal. vi. 6&mdash;9. Heb. xiii. 7, 17, 18.</P>
<P N="6">6. Rea&s;on and revelation agree, in determining that the end of civil government is the <HI>good</HI> of the governed, by defending them again&s;t all &s;uch as would <HI>work ill to their neighbours;</HI> and in limiting the power of <HI>rulers</HI> there. And tho&s;e who invade the religious rights of others, are <HI>&s;elfcondemed,</HI> which of all things is the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to <HI>happi|ne&s;s,</HI> the great end of government. Rom. xiii. 3&mdash; 10. xiv. 10&mdash;23.</P>
<P N="7">7. If men will refu&s;e to be happy them&s;elves, yet their power to en&s;lave others is now greatly weakened. And a faithful improvement of our privileges will weaken it more and more, till there
<PB N="15" REF="017824_0015_0FA319C7C54F2568">&s;hall be no more u&s;e for <HI>&s;words,</HI> becau&s;e their &s;hall be <HI>none to hurt or de&s;troy in all God's holy mountain.</HI> I&s;aiah xi. 9. Micah iv. 1&mdash;4. And who would not be in earne&s;t for that glorious day?</P>
