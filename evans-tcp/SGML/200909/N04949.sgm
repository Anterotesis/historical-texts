<P>THO' the pious and ingenious Author of the following Meditations will by no Means allow his Name to be publi&s;hed; yet we think convenient to &s;ignify, that he is a Per&s;on of Liberal Education, and had his Heart &s;o &s;et on the Work of the Mini&s;try, as he voluntarily quit|ted &s;everal Offices of U&s;efulne&s;s and Honour in the Civil Order, to take the Care of Souls; and continued with great Acceptance in his mini&s;terial Labours, 'till in the my&s;terious Providence of GOD, &s;uch bodily Di&s;orders &s;eized him as, to the great Sorrow of many, obliged him to leave this his mo&s;t delightful Employment.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, as religious Contemplations are &s;till his main Bent and Exerci&s;e; He has been prevailed upon by his particular Friends to write
<PB REF="006193_0003_102807D34B7AB498">
down &s;everal of his Tho'ts upon diver&s;e Subjects, which they with Plea&s;ure have occa&s;ionally heard him utter in private Conver&s;ation. Some whereof are the following Pieces, which after great Im|portunity, he has at length re&s;igned to their Di&s;|po&s;al, tho' with a po&s;itive Prohibition of divulg|ing his Name. And we are confident they will be very grateful, and by the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing, hope will be u&s;eful to the &s;erious Peru&s;er, as they have been to many who have read them in Ma|nu&s;cript.</P>
<P>May our mo&s;t gracious GOD re&s;tore him to the free and full Exerci&s;e of all his former mini&s;|terial Abilities with greater Power and U&s;efulne&s;s than ever, to the Advancement of the Kingdom of CHRIST, and Joy of many: And may the Reader add his Prayers, for the &s;ame Favour, and reap everla&s;ting Benefit by the&s;e excellent Me|ditations.</P>

<HEAD>MEDITATIONS UPON THE HUMANITY <HI>of CHRIST.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Manhood of JESUS CHRIST is not a Per&s;on, but a Nature. A Per&s;on is one that is con&s;cious to him&s;elf with re&s;pect to his own Acts. That is, he can &s;ay, I did &s;o and &s;o: It was I, and not another. So in the Trinity, the Father can &s;ay, I begat the Son, and not another: The Son can &s;ay, I was begotten of the Father, I took humane Nature, and not the Father, nor the Spirit: And the Spirit can &s;ay, I, and not another, proceeded from the Father and the Son. So among Angels
<PB N="2" REF="006193_0004_102807D50889E5D8">
and Men, each has a Conciou&s;ne&s;s, a Sen&s;e or Apprehen&s;ion within him&s;elf; I did &s;o and &s;o, and not another; the Prai&s;e or the Blame of &s;uch and &s;uch Things belongs to me, and not another. But thus it is not with the humane Nature of CHRIST, con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from the Divine. The Manhood in him can't &s;ay, I did &s;o and &s;o, and the Acts are to be appropriated to me, and to no other. No, the Words &s;poken come out of the Mouth of a humane Body, and are con|ceived by a humane rational Soul; but that Body and Soul do belong to a Per&s;on that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|fore all Worlds, even that WORD which was with GOD, and was GOD, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So, when the Man JESUS &s;aid, <HI>My Soul is exceeding &s;orrowful unto Death; I thirst,</HI> &amp;c. the true Meaning of it is, not that any particular humane Per&s;on did &s;o or &s;o; but the Per&s;on of the Son of GOD did &s;o or &s;o in his humane Nature; or the humane Nature of the &s;econd Per&s;on in the Godhead did &s;o.&mdash; Hence, the Doings and Sufferings of that Nature have their Value and Merit; for they properly belong to the Son of GOD. They are his per&s;onal Acts; tho' not the Acts of the Divine Nature, yet the Acts of a Divine Per&s;on in humane Nature, or the Acts of the humane Nature of a Divine Per|&s;on. His Natures are two, Humane and Divine; his Per&s;on but one, even that &s;ame Divine Per&s;on
<PB N="3" REF="006193_0004_102807D50889E5D8">
that was with the Fir&s;t and Third Per&s;ons in the Godhead before all Worlds. Hence it was im|po&s;&s;ible for the humane Nature to &s;in; becau&s;e all it's Actions were the Actions of a Per&s;on per|fectly and infinitely Holy.&mdash; If it be objected, That by the &s;ame Way of Arguing, no natural Weakne&s;&s;es and Infirmities could be attributed to the humane Nature of CHRIST, as Hunger, Thir&s;t, Wearine&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the Body Ignorance of &s;ome Things, Sorrow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the Soul; becau&s;e the Per&s;on of the Son of GOD was infinitely above all the&s;e Imperfections: &mdash; It may be an&s;wered, That tho' it was impo&s;&s;ible for a Divine Per&s;on to be &s;ubject to any of tho&s;e innocent Infirmities in his Divine Nature; yet it was po&s;&s;ible and much for his declarative Glory to a&s;&s;ume a Nature &s;ub|ject to the&s;e innocent Weakne&s;&s;es; but it would be infinitely di&s;honourable, and &s;o infinitely im|po&s;&s;ible, that the humane Nature of a Divine Per&s;on &s;hould be &s;ubject to any <HI>&s;inful</HI> Imperfecti|on. And then the Per&s;on of the Son of GOD has his own humane Nature ab&s;olutely under his Power, and he can't po&s;&s;ibly &s;uffer it to &s;in. &mdash; Hence al&s;o the Man CHRIST JESUS, even when here on Earth in his Humiliation, &s;peaks in Language &s;ometimes proper only to the Divine Nature as, <HI>Before</HI> Abraham <HI>was</HI> I am; for tho' the Words were uttered by the humane Nature,
<PB N="4" REF="006193_0005_102807D9021BA470">
yet the Per&s;on to whom that Nature belonged was really and truly GOD. &mdash; So the Man JESUS made no Scruple of receiving divine Wor&s;hip and Adoration from Men, thereby <HI>making Him&s;elf equal with GOD;</HI> for he was con&s;cious to him|&s;elf that He was truly and properly GOD, as well as Man.&mdash;</P>
<P>The humane Nature of CHRIST was every Way like the humane Nature of another Man, Sin only excepted. While it was on Earth it was (with that Exception) every Way like unto Men in their imperfect State: And it is no where a&s;&s;erted in Scripture, that I know of, (whatever Tradition has been pretended to hand down) that there was any Thing in his Countenance or outward Ap|pearance (except at his Transfiguration) that di&s;|tingui&s;hed him from his Brethren; unle&s;s that <HI>his Vi&s;age was more marred,</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; And the Endowments of his humane Mind differed only in Degree from tho&s;e of other holy Men: He had the &s;ame Kind of Knowledge, Wi&s;dom, Love, Courage, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> but only in an high. Degree He was always full of the&s;e Things; there was no &s;inful Deficiency: And the&s;e Endowments in|crea&s;ed and grew in him as he grew in Years. There was a Time when he did not (as Man) know his Right Hand from his Left, nor his own Mother from another Woman; but he in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="006193_0005_102807D9021BA470">
in Knowledge, Wi&s;dom, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> as other Children do, by the &s;ame Means and in the &s;ame Manner; but with this Difference, that he im|proved his Powers and Advantages to the utmo&s;t. Even when a Child he never omitted one Oppor|tunity of getting Increa&s;e in Wi&s;dom, Knowledge, <HI>&amp;c;</HI> was never chargeable with the lea&s;t Degree of Indifferency, Negligence or Carele&s;sne&s;s; never &s;pent one Moment's Time in Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Recreation, <HI>&amp;c;</HI> but what ought to be &s;o &s;pent. And his Improvements were va&s;tly quick and large, but &s;till gradual as he grew in Age and Stature.</P>
<P>What Degree of Wi&s;dom, Knowledge, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> the humane Nature had more for it's Union with the Divine, was purely according to the Will and Plea&s;ure of the Divine Per&s;on. As our bodily Sen|&s;es are in great Mea&s;ure under the Command of a Spirit belonging to the &s;ame Per&s;on (the Body often &s;ees, hears, ta&s;tes, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> at the Will and Plea|&s;ure of the Soul;) So the humane Nature knew and acted nothing beyond the Power and Reach of a mere humane Capacity, but only as the Divine Per&s;on was plea&s;ed to communicate. Ac|cordingly the humane Nature of CHRIST knew not but there were Figgs on the Figg-Tree, till he came near enough to &s;ee; and yet at another Time that &s;ame humane Nature knew and could
<PB N="6" REF="006193_0006_102807DAD8AC19E0">
an&s;wer the Thoughts of Men's Hearts, when the Divine was plea&s;ed to communicate that Know|ledge. So, the humane Nature while he did not know the particular Day and Hour of the la&s;t Judgment; and yet at the &s;ame Time he knew and could foretel the mo&s;t remarkable Events that were to fall out, from the Time then pre&s;ent, to the End of the World, and the very Circum&s;tances of the La&s;t Judgment.</P>
<P>[By the Way, it is &s;o far from being a Di&s;ho|nour to CHRIST'S Per&s;on, to &s;peak of the inno|cent Imperfections of the humane Nature, accor|ding to Scripture Light, that it is the great Illu&s;|tration of his conde&s;cending Love, that he would take the humane Nature into per&s;onal Union with the Divine, under &s;uch Circum&s;tances.]</P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST had all the innocent Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections of the humane Nature; &s;uch as Love, Hatred, Joy, Sorrow, Anger, <HI>&amp;c:</HI> and they were moved and wrought upon after the &s;ame Manner with tho&s;e of other Men; &s;till always ex|cepting any &s;inful Imperfection, which tho&s;e who think aright of the&s;e Things, will continually bear in their Minds. To in&s;tance here only in one Par|ticular, in&s;tead of many: Tho' he knew the pre|&s;ent State of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and was doubtle&s;s think|ing of it all along his Journey from <HI>Galiiee,</HI> yet we read not of any extraordinary Motion of the
<PB N="7" REF="006193_0006_102807DAD8AC19E0">
Pa&s;&s;ions, till his Eye affected his Heart: Then, 'tis &s;aid, <HI>He beheld the City and wept over it.</HI>&mdash; His Body al&s;o was expo&s;ed to all tho&s;e Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es and Pains, that another humane Body is, and po&s;&s;ibly much more &s;en&s;ible of them, as being prepared for that very Purpo&s;e to be the Seat of Sufferings. As the Sen&s;es of Man in Innocency were &s;o con|trived as to be &s;o many Avenues of Plea&s;ure from every Quarter; &s;o the bodily Sen&s;es of the LORD JESUS were de&s;igned as &s;o many Conduits to con|vey into his Soul the bitter Waters of the Cur&s;e due to the Elect.&mdash;Whether the humane Nature of CHRIST were liable to a natural Death by Sick|ne&s;s, or Age or no, has been doubted; but we know it was &s;ubject to a violent one. And what there &s;hould be in his Con&s;titution (who was made of a Woman) that &s;hould pre&s;erve him from the Decays of Age, and the mortal Di&s;ea&s;es that Men in General are expo&s;ed to, is not revealed. It was by &s;pecial Providence that he was pre&s;er|ved from Death, natural or violent, till his Hour was come.</P>
<P>And as the humane Nature of CHRIST was <HI>like unto &s;inful Fle&s;h</HI> in this World; &s;o I know of no Rea&s;on to think now it is in Glory, that there is any e&s;&s;ential Difference betwixt that and tho&s;e of <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elijah,</HI> that are there in their whole Per&s;ons, and what tho&s;e of all the Saints will be
<PB N="8" REF="006193_0007_102807DE12B86390">
after the Re&s;urrection. The humane Nature of CHRIST in Heaven, con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from the Divine, is no more than a Man perfect in all created humane Excellencies. It &s;till remains finite in every Power and Faculty and Endow|ment both or Body and Soul, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily do &s;o forever.</P>
<P>Whatever Alterations there may be in his <HI>Body,</HI> on the Account of which it may be termed a <HI>&s;piritual Body;</HI> yet &s;till it is a humane Body, and &s;ubject to the &s;ame Laws of Matter and Motion that other Bodies are. The Alterations that Bodies are &s;ubject to here below, are exceeding great and wonderful: To in&s;tance only in that of a Tallow Candle, Suppo&s;e an Inch of it, What a norrow Compa&s;s does it lie in? What a dull and motionle&s;s little Lump is it? yet do but touch it to another that is lighted and what a Change is there made? It flames and &s;hines and diffu&s;es it's Light, not only through the whole Room, di&s;covering that which lay hid in Darkne&s;s there, but &s;preads it&s;elf far and wide, and lies (as they tell us, that Study tho&s;e Things) after the Rate of &s;ome Millions of Miles, in a Minute. All this &s;preading &s;hining Flame is no|thing but that &s;ame little Piece of Tallow that lay a Minute before covered in the &s;ame Darkne&s;s with other Things about the Hou&s;e, only putting
<PB N="9" REF="006193_0007_102807DE12B86390">
on another Form, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &mdash; So the humane Body, tho' perhaps transformed into pure cele&s;tial Light, (which is mo&s;t like Spirit or any material Sub|&s;tance we can conceive of) &s;o that it may po&s;&s;i|bly &s;pread it &s;elf many thou&s;ands of Miles round in a Minute; and then in another Minute, con|tract it&s;elf into the narrow Compa&s;s of a few In|ches, and appear in what Shape the Soul plea&s;es; as we read of his appearing &s;ometimes in one Form and &s;ometimes in another; yet &s;till it is but the &s;ame Body in a different Form, that was confined within the Dimen&s;ions of an ordi|nary humane Body while here below, and could neither extend or contract it &s;elf into any other Limits, nor appear in any other Form.</P>
<P>And &s;o whatever Change the humane <HI>Soul</HI> of CHRIST may have undergone by his Glorifica|tion; how va&s;tly &s;oever the Powers and Facul|ties thereof are enlarged, and all filled to the Brim with Knowledge and Grace, yea with all the communicable Fulne&s;s of the Godhead; yet &s;till it is but a finite, humane Soul, infinitely be|low the Perfection of the Divine Nature, and mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity continue &s;o &s;orever.</P>
<P>As CHRIST'S humane Nature is in all other &s;inle&s;s Re&s;pects like other Men, &s;o it has a <HI>humane Love.</HI> He had, when here, a natural Affection to his Relations, and a peculiar Love to &s;ome
<PB N="10" REF="006193_0008_102807E224793FF0">
particular Per&s;ons, that either had no Grace at all, as the <HI>young Man</HI> in the Go&s;pel, or that had no more Grace than &s;ome others, it may be as the beloved Di&s;ciple <HI>John.</HI> And he had a common Love to all Mankind: As he was in &s;ome Sen&s;e <HI>the Saviour of all Men,</HI> &s;o he had &s;trong De&s;ires of the Salvation of every individual Per&s;on, with|out Di&s;tinction of Elect and Reprobate. Nor could he know, as <HI>Man,</HI> unle&s;s it were made known to him by &s;pecial Revelation, who among the Unconverted were the cho&s;en of GOD, and who were not; and therefore did, as his faithful Servants do, labour for the Good of all; and it was the Grief of his Heart that his Labours were no more &s;ucce&s;sful. And this was no doubt (next to &s;eeing his heavenly Father di&s;honour'd) one of the greate&s;t Afflictions he met with while here, to &s;ee his Neighbours, (whom he <HI>loved as him|&s;elf,</HI> according to the Law he was made under) continually wounding and de&s;troying their own Souls, and &s;lighting and neglecting the only Re|medy. That &s;ame Affection that glowed in the Heart and flamed out of the Mouth of the Apo|&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> towards his <HI>Brethren according to the Fle&s;h,</HI> was in a far higher Degree (the Sinfulne&s;s of it excepted) in the Heart of the Lord JESUS towards all Mankind, without Di&s;tinction: He did actually make him&s;elf a <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> for them. Tho'
<PB N="11" REF="006193_0008_102807E224793FF0">
as GOD he had his Eye and Love in an e&s;pecial Manner on the Elect; yet as Man (and that is the Nature we are &s;peaking of) he was not capa|ble, as was &s;aid, of making the Di&s;tinction be|tween them and others. No, when he looked round from the Cro&s;s on the great Crowd of Peo|ple that were gathered together on that Occa&s;ion, he loved and pitied them all, without Di&s;tinction, except one of a thou&s;and perhaps, whom he knew to be Converts by his per&s;onal Acquaintance with them. There was not one of that va&s;t Multi|tude, that (as Man) he could know was not to be converted about &s;ix Weeks after, when the Spirit was to be poured out in &s;uch a wonderful Manner, unle&s;s it were particularly revealed to him, and unle&s;s there were &s;ome among them who he knew had committed the unpardonable Sin. And what large Additions, may we &s;uppo&s;e it made to the Floods of Sorrow and Di&s;tre&s;s that were then pouring in upon him on all Sides, to &s;ee tho&s;e whom he loved &s;o as to be then actually dying for them; yea, &s;ome Thou&s;ands of whom he knew were eternally to reap the Benefit of his Sufferings, and to lie in his Bo&s;om forever, all joining to mook and deride him in his Agonies, and like the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> over <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> to &s;hout and triumph, as having got him whom they ac|counted the common Enemy of their Nation,
<PB N="12" REF="006193_0009_102807E4D742B258">
nailed to the Cro&s;s, and dying the Death of the wor&s;t of Malefactors? It was a Man, the mo&s;t loving, kind, tender-hearted Man, that ever was born of a Woman that &s;aw all this; they were his own Fle&s;h and Blood, and the dearly beloved of his Soul, who were the Actors in this bloody Tragedy.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash; The humane Nature of the Lord JESUS CHRIST is mentioned as one great Thing that qualified him to be the <HI>Judge</HI> of the World. All Judgment is committed unto him, <HI>becau&s;e he is the Son of Man.</HI> GOD will judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s by that <HI>Man</HI> whom he hath ordain|ed. The Judge will be, not only the Heart-&s;earching GOD, but one that had, and &s;till has all the e&s;&s;ential Properties of the humane Nature: One that not only has the &s;ame Nature with the Per|&s;ons to be judged; but one that loved them, many of them per&s;onally, with a real &s;trong Affection.</P>
<P>The Saints will be peculiarly happy in the En|joyment of GOD in <HI>their own Nature.</HI> A great Part of the rational Creature's Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>Society</HI> that is <HI>&s;uitable.</HI> Some have thought <Q>this is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to Happine&s;s, that a Plurality of Per&s;ons in GOD might be inferred from this Con&s;ideration alone; That to have Commu|nion in mutual Knowledge, Love and Enjoy|ment, is the very E&s;&s;ence of Felicity, and that
<PB N="13" REF="006193_0009_102807E4D742B258">
a Being in all Re&s;pects perfectly &s;ingle and alone, without any more Per&s;ons than one &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in his E&s;&s;ence, cannot be completely happy.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>In order to Society's being <HI>&s;uitable,</HI> it mu&s;t be between Parties that have the &s;ame Nature: So that tho' <HI>Adam,</HI> when he was fir&s;t made might have Communion with GOD, and with the holy Angels, and had a World of Creatures round a|bout him at his Command; yet he was &s;aid to be <HI>alone,</HI> and it was <HI>not good</HI> for him to be &s;o alone, and therefore GOD made him one of the &s;ame Nature to be an <HI>Help-meet</HI> for him. And when his Companion was brought to him, he takes particular Notice of it, that &s;he was <HI>Bone of his Bone,</HI> and taken out of the <HI>Man,</HI> one of the &s;ame Nature with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>GOD having a De&s;ign to make Creatures ex|ceeding happy, probably far more &s;o than the Angels, the happie&s;t Creatures he at fir&s;t made; was plea&s;ed, in order to this, to permit them to fall into the Depth of Mi&s;ery (which was a Cir|cum&s;tance greatly tending to inhance their Felici|ty) and then to advance them, not only to Com|munion with the Angels, of a Nature different from their own, and to Communion with Him|&s;elf, of a Nature infinitely above them; but to Communion with and Enjoyment of a <HI>Per&s;on</HI> that had really in Him all the Glory and Excellency and
<PB N="14" REF="006193_0010_102807E685290B80">
All-&s;ufficiency of the <HI>Divine Nature</HI> (for He is really and truly GOD) and al&s;o all the Suitable|ne&s;s and Agreeablene&s;s of the <HI>Human Nature</HI> in the utmo&s;t Perfection; and that in as &s;trict and clo&s;e a <HI>Union</HI> with him, as 'tis po&s;&s;ible for di&s;tinct Per&s;ons to be joined in, one to another, except|ing only the Per&s;ons of the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity them|&s;elves. So that, as far as we can learn, the Elect of Mankind are to be the happie&s;t of all created Per&s;ons, and the happie&s;t of all created Beings, except the humane Nature of CHRIST; who <HI>in all Things must have the Preheminence,</HI> and who is not a created Per&s;on, but one of the two Natures (as was &s;aid) in the uncreated Per&s;on of the eternal Son of GOD.</P>
<P>Though the humane Nature of CHRIST be now in a glorified State, and his pre&s;ent Happine&s;s is great, far beyond our Conceptions; yet it &s;eems, that it mu&s;t needs be far &s;hort of that Per|fection which he will enjoy when he &s;hall have the <HI>whole Body</HI> of his beloved Elect with him in Glory.

And though his pre&s;ent exceeding great Glory, to|gether with a clear Pro&s;pect of what he, and all his, are &s;hortly to enjoy together in Perfection, and for ever, is abundantly more than enough to over-ballance every le&s;s comfortable View and Pro&s;pect of Things, which he has more immedi|ately before him; yet one would be apt to think a finite humane Nature mu&s;t needs be far le&s;s happy in the mo&s;t realizing <HI>Belief</HI> of Things <HI>to come,</HI> than in the <HI>pre&s;ent Enjoyment</HI> of them. It is &s;poken of as nece&s;&s;ary in order to the Perfection of Happine&s;s, that what is <HI>in Part</HI> &s;hould be <HI>done

away,</HI> that what is <HI>perfect</HI> may come; and that <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> &s;hould give Place to the perfect Re&s;t of <HI>Love</HI> in actual Fruition.</P>
<P>It may be Matter of Doubt, whether any cre|ated Nature, even that of the Man CHRIST JESUS him&s;elf is capable of enjoying &s;o much Happine&s;s at any <HI>one</HI> &s;et Time, as it may be by a <HI>Progre&s;&s;ion,</HI> or going forward; and whether it be not the in|communicable Property of the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> to enjoy &s;o much Felicity <HI>at once,</HI> that there can be <HI>no Addition</HI> made to it: And if &s;o, Whether there is not Rea&s;on to believe, GOD will add this one Property more to the un&s;peakable Happine&s;s of the humane Nature of CHRIST, that it &s;hall be <HI>eternally Progre&s;&s;ive,</HI> or growing and increa&s;ing forever; and that this will be granted to the Members, as well as the Head. Surely the ble&s;&s;ed GOD is infinitely far from grudging to the hu|mane Nature of his own Son, and the Objects of his &s;pecial Love, any Qualification in their Hap|pine&s;s that &s;hall render it <HI>more de&s;ireable:</HI> E&s;pe|cially con&s;idering, that he de&s;igns his own Glory in the Creature's Happine&s;s, and that they are naturally and &s;trongly inclined to give him all the Prai&s;e of it forever; and that he him&s;elf (as 'tis infinite Rea&s;on) will be never the le&s;s peerle&s;s and unrivalled in his own boundle&s;s Happine&s;s, how far &s;o ever any of his Creatures &s;hall advance in

their's. For let Creatures be advancing never &s;o fa&s;t and never &s;o far in Happine&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ing that of all the Saints and Angels in Heaven were to be doubled to each particular Per&s;on every Minute to Eternity, yet this will never bring them one Hair's Breadth nearer in Degree to the Felicity of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD: For Infinity has no Degrees. All Additions to what is Finite brings it no nearer to what is Infinite, than it was at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked, why it was nece&s;&s;ary that the <HI>Two Natures</HI> in the Mediator &s;hould make but <HI>One Per&s;on?</HI> It is an&s;wered, That no other Being, but &s;uch a one, could perform what was to be done for the Elect's Salvation. For if you could &s;uppo&s;e a Being con&s;i&s;ting of two Per&s;ons, one humane, the other Divine, (as the Godhead &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts in three divine Per&s;ons,) &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ed Being could not have been a &s;uitable Mediator. For tho' the humane Per&s;on could have done and &s;uffered what was proper, yet it would have been only of a finite Value, and &s;o could not have an|&s;wered the Needs of Sinners, who were infinitely indebted to Divine Ju&s;tice; and what the Divine Per&s;on could have done, would not have been &s;uitable, it being in another Nature than that of the Sinner's, and &s;uch a Divine Per&s;on could not have &s;uffered at all.&mdash; But now, in the Per&s;on of CHRIST there is a humane Nature that is capa|ble

of Doing and Suffering as much and more than any humane Per&s;on, &s;uppo&s;ing him perfect, could do, and all that is &s;o done and &s;uffered is really and properly the Act of a Per&s;on infinite and divine, and &s;o of infinite Value; and that divine Per&s;on under no natural Obligations to do or &s;uffer any Thing of this, and &s;o it might be imputed to the Per&s;ons who needed it for their Ju&s;tification and Salvation.</P>

as almo&s;t any we read of in Scripture; and perhaps no In&s;tance in profane Hi&s;tory does in any Mea&s;ure equal it: Very few if any among mere Men de&s;erved better from the Hands of his Fel|low-Creatures than he from his Childhood up, and few received wor&s;e. He was dutiful to his Parents, faithful, loving, obliging, and officious to his Brethren, and pious to his GOD from his very Childhood: And when he came to &s;u&s;tain new Relations and Circum&s;tances va&s;tly different, yea quite contrary to what he had been in before, yet &s;till he exemplified in the whole of his Beha|viour the &s;ame Spirit of Wi&s;dom and Grace that he had &s;hewn before. But how was this extraor|dinary Per&s;on treated? He was envied, hated, mocked, &s;old for a Slave for Life, and very nar|rowly e&s;caped being murdered by his obliged Brethren: He was reproved by his fond Father, when perhaps he did not de&s;erve it; He was fal&s;ely accu&s;ed after he had been wickedly tempt|ed by his fir&s;t enamoured and then enraged Mi&s;|tre&s;s; He was &s;u&s;pected, ca&s;t off, and impri&s;on|ed by his Ma&s;ter, who&s;e Con&s;cience as well as his own had given Te&s;timony to his univer&s;al Faith|fulne&s;s, the remarkable Pre&s;ence of GOD with him, and His extraordinary Ble&s;&s;ing upon all his Affairs for <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Sake.

his Confinement, yet it &s;eems for &s;ome Part, and perhaps the greate&s;t Part of the Time, (which was &s;everal Years,) he was laid in Affliction and Iron, yea the Iron did eat into his Soul: And after he was as it were tantalized with &s;ome Hope of De|liverance by the Intere&s;t at Court, he might in all Rea&s;on expect the Ju&s;tice and Gratitude of the chief Butler would incline him to make for him, this Hope deferred made his Heart &s;ick for two Years more. What the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his Heart, and what the more invi&s;ible A&s;&s;aults and Tempta|tions of his grand Adver&s;ary were all this while, is not recorded; but be&s;ure his greate&s;t and be&s;t Friend overuled and ordered it all, and yet &mdash; <HI>GOD meant it unto Good. &mdash; Jo&s;eph</HI> him&s;elf tells us &s;o, and he was the greate&s;t Sufferer, un|le&s;s you will &s;uppo&s;e his tender Father (with whom you will ea&s;ily conceive he bitterly &s;ym|pathized) might po&s;&s;ibly endure as much as he. His hard-hearted Brethren be&s;ure by all that is revealed, were very little affected, they &s;at down to eat and drink in the mid&s;t of their poor Bro|ther's Di&s;tre&s;s; and if they did not ri&s;e up to Play like the idolatrous <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> yet they did that which was wor&s;e: All their Concern was to con|trive a Device to cover their own Guilt, and to deceive, not to comfort, their poor Father, what|ever they pretended. I &s;ay <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> him&s;elf who

<P N="1">(1.) <HI>GOD meant it for Good to</HI> Jo&s;eph <HI>him|&s;elf.</HI> It was to humble him and prove him, and do him good in his latter End.&mdash; He was by this Means early and effectually taken off from the Vanities and Follies which Youth are expo&s;ed to, and mo&s;t of them forever undone by. For tho' his Circum&s;tances in <HI>Egypt</HI> at fir&s;t were &s;uch as abundantly &s;upplied him with all the Delights of Sen&s;e, being &s;oon made a Steward in the Hou&s;e of a rich Gentleman, yet it is plain enough that he was in a wonderful Degree cold and dead to tho&s;e youthful Lu&s;ts that &s;uch a Condition might

His early Piety was much improved and advanced doubtle&s;s by a Cour&s;e of &s;ore Affliction, and we have no Rea&s;on to think he was denied tho&s;e inward Comforts and Refre&s;hments which a gracious GOD is wont to allow to his afflicted Children. It was true then, as well as it has been often found by Ex|perience &s;ince, that <HI>Tribulation worketh Patience, Patience Experience, and Experience Hope, and Hope maketh not a&s;hamed, becau&s;e the Love of GOD is &s;hed abroad in the Heart.</HI> As his Afflic|tions abounded, we may well &s;uppo&s;e his Con&s;o|lations in CHRIST, in the promi&s;ed MESSIAH, in whom he believed, abounded al&s;o.&mdash;He was hereby prepared for great future Honour and Advancement, to be made the &s;econd Man in one of the greate&s;t Kingdoms then in the World, even Ruler over all the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to bind their Princes at his Plea&s;ure, and to teach their Senators Wi&s;dom. And his Afflictions were ordered for his Humiliation, and the Mortifica|tion of his Corruptions; without which Prepara|tion his Pro&s;perity in all likelihood would have de&s;troyed him, he would have been lifted up with Pride, and fallen into the Condemnation of the Devil. So his living fir&s;t in a Courtier's Family, and afterwards conver&s;ing &s;o long and &s;o familiar|ly with two great Men his Fellow-Pri&s;oners, was

And he being an Interpreter of Dreams, and having his own always in his Mind, and &s;o being apprehen|&s;ive in &s;ome Degree what was before him; doubt|le&s;s made the be&s;t Improvement he could of all the Advantages he had put into his Hands to qualify him&s;elf for his future Advancement, and his being u&s;eful and &s;erviceable therein: And be|ing thus in one Re&s;pect and another, prepared for his Enlargement and Exaltation; it was indeed <HI>good</HI> unto him, and really a Step towards the Crown of Glory re&s;erved for him in the Heavens, and that extraordinary Recompence of Reward, that far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, which his uncommon Sufferings and &s;pecial Ser|vices done for the Church of GOD and the World, and the eminent Degrees of Grace exerci&s;ed therein had wrought for him by working him up to a &s;uitable Frame and Temper to receive and po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame.

And wherever the Go&s;pel is preached, it is mere|ly the Will of Man, and nothing el&s;e that hin|ders the &s;aving Efficacy of it; tho' it is only the Power of GOD that can &s;ubdue and conquer that Will of Man.

<PB N="64" REF="006193_0035_10280831F8987AC8">
and his Tongue always as the Pen of a ready Writer, to utter the Things which he was con|tinually making concerning this <HI>King of Glory.</HI> He was a Man of uncommon Parts and Learning, a great Morali&s;t, a &s;trict Phari&s;ee, and of great Fame among his own Country-Men; but his high E&s;teem of, and his ardent Affection to a glorious CHRIST &s;wallowed up all.

<P>The Copulative <HI>And,</HI> in the Words before us, point us back to the preceeding Context. He had, in the Beginning of this Chapter, entered upon a Sentence, which he does not fini&s;h, till he comes to the next Chapter.

<P>And, by the Way, this Manner of Preaching and Writing which this Prince of Authors and Preachers does often run into, even though under
<PB N="65" REF="006193_0035_10280831F8987AC8">
immediate infallible In&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t, does excu&s;e (if not ju&s;tify and commend) the Practice of &s;ome fervent Preachers in their <HI>Di|gre&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Excur&s;ions;</HI> by &s;ome of which they may po&s;&s;ibly do more Good, than by their more premeditated and methodical Performances. If the main End be an&s;wered; if CHRIST be preach|ed, and Souls convinced, converted and &s;aved, all's well; for all is well that ends well. But to return from this Excur&s;ion. &mdash;</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle had been telling the <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> in the preceeding Ver&s;es, what his <HI>Wi&s;hes</HI> and <HI>Prayers</HI> for them were, when in his Clo&s;et and on his Knees, pouring out his Soul before the Lord. He was now under Confinement, and it &s;eems it was &s;ome how or other on <HI>their Account:</HI> and though he was exceeding joyful in all his Tribu|lations, experiencing (as thou&s;ands of others have done) mo&s;t of his ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter's &s;en&s;ible and comforting Pre&s;ence, when he was &s;uffering mo&s;t for his Sake; yet he was concerned for <HI>them,</HI> le&s;t (as he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in another Ca&s;e) they &s;hould be <HI>&s;wallowed up of over-much Grief,</HI> le&s;t they &s;hould faint at <HI>his Tribulations,</HI> (which he tells them <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 13. was <HI>their Glory;</HI> 'twas an Honour to them that their dear &s;piritual Father &s;hould be counted worthy to &s;uffer &s;uch Things for the Name of CHRIST:) he therefore a&s;ks of

<P>But is not this a Contradiction in Terms? How could they <HI>know</HI> that which could <HI>not</HI> be known? Does the Apo&s;tle pray for Impo&s;&s;ibili|ties? So it &s;eems.

He &s;pake as no mere Man ever &s;pake, becau&s;e he thought, perhaps, as no other be&s;ides him&s;elf ever tho't.

<P>The Love of CHRIST as <HI>Man</HI> was perfect in it's Kind; there was no Defect in any Re&s;pect, or at any Time what&s;oever. It was always ex|erci&s;ed towards &s;uch Objects, in &s;uch a Degree, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, from &s;uch Motives and in &s;uch a Manner, as a perfect humane Love &s;hould be. It an&s;wered the perfect Law of GOD, under which he was made exactly, in every Particular, continually. His Love was indeed the fulfilling of the Law. The piercing Eye of omni&s;cient Ju&s;tice it &s;elf could find no manner of Deficiency in it. &mdash; The Man CHRIST JESUS lov'd GOD his heavenly Father with all his Heart, and with all his Soul, and with all his Mind, and with all his Strength. He was as much concerned for his Honour and Glory; He took as much Delight in Communion with him; He mourn'd as much for the Di&s;honour done to

his Name, by the Sins of Men and Devils; was as ready, chearful, con&s;tant and per&s;evering in doing his Will and &s;uffering whatever GOD was plea&s;ed to lay upon him (even to the laying down his very Life at his Command) as was po&s;&s;ible. &mdash; There was no Intermi&s;&s;ion, no Remi&s;&s;ion or A|batement of the mo&s;t inten&s;e Degree of Love, in any of the&s;e Re&s;pects. And tho' his Body was &s;ometimes weary, and his Animal Spirits exhau|&s;ted, &s;o that he needed Refre&s;hment by Sleep, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (as other Men do;) yet his Soul was always lively, always flaming in Love to GOD more than any of the Seraphims that are round about the Throne of GOD. His very Dreams, we may be &s;ure, when his bodily Sen&s;es were locked up in a State of Inactivity, were nothing but holy and heavenly Meditations and Vi&s;ions, of what was pa&s;t, pre|&s;ent, or to come, without the lea&s;t Degree of Vanity or &s;inful Imperfection; &s;till nothing but the plea&s;ing or &s;orrowful Workings of perfect Love, according to the re&s;pective Objects of his innocent Fancy and Imagination.</P>
<P>He loved the Creatures, ju&s;t as it was fit and becoming he &s;hould do, and loved them all ju&s;t enough and idolized none of them. He loved the holy Angels full as much as they de&s;erved. And with re&s;pect to Mankind, he always came up to the perfect Rule, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neigh|bour

Loved even his Enemies, the wor&s;t of 'em: He pitied them, he wept over them, he prayed for them, even when they were actually murdering of him. <HI>Father, forgive them,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>they know not what they do.</HI> He loved &s;ome with a peculiar &amp; di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Love. He loved his earthly Parents with a filial Affection and was &s;ubject to them, tho' &s;till in &s;ubordination to GOD. A remarkable In&s;tance of his tender Concern for his Mother, was the Care he took of her in his dying Agonies; when one would have thought it impo&s;&s;ible for him to take Notice of any Creature, being overwhelmed with a Sen&s;e of the innumerable Millions of the Sins of the Elect imputed to him, and the Wrath of an infinite GOD flaming again&s;t him for the &s;ame. He loved his Kin&s;men according to the Fle&s;h with an Affection exactly and perfectly &s;ui|table to every Relation. In a Word, the whole Cour&s;e of his Life, from his early Childhood to his dying Day, was nothing but one perpetual Scene of Love. He never gave the lea&s;t ju&s;t Oc|ca&s;ion of Offence in Word or Deed. He always rejoiced with tho&s;e that did rejoice, and wept with tho&s;e that wept, as there was Occa&s;ion&punc;

He went about doing good, and was always ready to every good Work. And he &s;uffered as well as acted from a Principle of pure Love to Man, as well as GOD. Was he <HI>a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief?</HI> Did he <HI>endure the Con|tradiction of Sinners again&s;t him&s;elf?</HI> Did he <HI>not hide his Face from Shame and Spitting?</HI> Did he <HI>bear the Sins of many in his own Body on the Tree,</HI> after he had &s;weat Blood in the Garden? In a Word, Did he <HI>pour out his Soul unto Death,</HI> and endure the hidings of his Father's Face, yea the very Pangs of Damnation? It was all from mere, pure, unmixed Love.

It is not revealed that GOD had any other Way to make known his rich and glorious Grace to &s;uch a Degree, as by making known to his Crea|tures this <HI>Love of CHRIST which pa&s;&s;eth Know|ledge.</HI></P>
<P>This Knowledge is the <HI>Operation</HI> of the HOLY SPIRIT, who was promi&s;ed to lead CHRIST'S Di&s;ciples into all Truth. It is a Work of Al|mighty Power; it is done by a &s;trong Hand. In order to the Soul's receiving of it, &s;he mu&s;t be <HI>&s;trengthened with Might in the inner Man.</HI> Her Powers were weakened by the Fall, &s;o that they are not able to receive this Divine Light.

Their Knowledge is the &s;ame in Kind, though it differs in Degree, from what it was before. As a Man that is born blind may know much of the Philo|&s;ophy of Light and Colours by humane In&s;tructi|ons, and be greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted and &s;ucceeded in his Studies on that Subject, by the common Influences of the Spirit of CHRIST, <HI>in whom are hid all the Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge</HI> of every Kind; &s;o that he &s;hall be able to &s;peak of the&s;e Things for the In&s;truction of others, and for the Glory of the GOD of Nature: Yet, after all, he has no &s;uch Idea of Light and Colours in his own Mind as every Man that &s;ees has; but may be farther from it than he was at fir&s;t, as he him&s;elf may &s;ee, when his Eyes come to be opened, tho' he could not be &s;en&s;ible of it before. He has formed all his Ideas of Light and Colours agreeable to Notions he had received into his Mind by his Hearing, Smelling, Ta&s;ting or Feeling; and whenever he thinks or &s;peaks of Light and Co|lours, he does it as of &s;omething that he has heard, &s;melt, ta&s;ted or felt; and the oftner and the lon|ger he thinks and &s;peaks of them, tho' he does it in the &s;ame Words that other Men do, yet his wrong Notions are but the more confirmed there|by.

I was rejoiced to hear, that you &s;pent one whole Night in Di&s;cour&s;e with &s;uch a live Chri&s;tian as Mr. <HI>S:</HI> for I concluded that your Talk mu&s;t be about heavenly Things. But, O my dear Brother, you mu&s;t forgive your loving Si&s;ter if I am jealous over you with a godly Jealou&s;y. When I con&s;ider, that <HI>many are called, but few are cho&s;en,</HI> that <HI>many &s;hall &s;eek to enter in at the &s;treight Gate, and not be able;</HI> how far a Man may go, and yet, thro' one Temptation or another, fall &s;hort at la&s;t; that &s;ome are not far from the Kingdom of GOD,

and yet never come thither; I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for you, left all your Convictions &s;hould come to nothing. I tremble for fear you &s;hould be taken up with the Cares and Troubles of this pre&s;ent evil World, &s;o as to neglect the one Thing needful. O con&s;ider you cannot &s;erve two Ma&s;ters, GOD and <HI>Mammon.</HI> If ever you e&s;cape that dreadful Hell, and obtain that ble&s;&s;ed Inheritance among the Saints in Light; you mu&s;t make a Bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion, you mu&s;t be in earne&s;t, and <HI>&s;trive to enter in at the &s;treight Gate; for many &s;hall &s;eek to enter in, and not be able.</HI> You may think a great deal about your Soul and Eternity; you may be glad to enquire of good People, <HI>What</HI> you <HI>&s;hall do to inherit Eternal Life;</HI> you may hear the Word with Joy and much Affection, and do many Things; yea live in all good Con&s;cience, as you may think, and yet lack <HI>one</HI> Thing. And therefore I mu&s;t entreat and be&s;eech you, as ever you expect to &s;ee the Face of GOD with Comfort another Day, that you will never re&s;t till you are &s;ure you have experienced a &s;aving Change on your Soul. O cry to GOD Day and Night, that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;hew you Things really as they are, and enable you to hate and abhor and for&s;ake all Sin, and <HI>fly for Refuge to lay hold on the Hope &s;et before you;</HI> that he would make a &s;aving Di&s;covery of CHRIST to you, and enable you to receive him as of|fered in the Go&s;pel. And if you &s;hould knock and &s;eek and &s;trive for a while and find no Peace or Comfort, but rather more Terror, or, which is wor&s;e, feel nothing but Deadne&s;s, Coldne&s;s and Sen&s;ele&s;sne&s;s of Spirit, and in every Re&s;pect &s;eem to grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and find Satan more bu&s;y with his Temptations than ever; yet be not di&s;couraged by any Means, but hold on &s;eek|ing

and &s;triving to the la&s;t Ga&s;p: <HI>In due Time you &s;hall reap, if you faint not.</HI> There's no thinking of looking bark: There's nothing but Death and Damnation there. The Avenger of Blood is clo&s;e at your Heels. Flee! Flee! for your Life, or you are a dead Man, a damned Man: But before you is a ble&s;&s;ed City of Refuge, and the dear compa&s;&s;ionate JESUS pitying you, and praying for you, and with his Arms wide open to receive you, as he has done many of late. O pre&s;s forward and get in, before the Door is &s;hut; for then it will be too late for ever.</P>
<P>My dear Brother, entreat me not to leave you; I mu&s;t cry after you to come to JESUS, come to the Marriage, yet there is Room. I hope, through mar|velous Grace, your poor unworthy Si&s;ter, and many of your Relations will be admitted to &s;it down with <HI>Abra|ham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> in the Kingdom of GOD. And can I bear to think my dear Brother &s;hould be ca&s;t out, bound Hand and Foot, and ca&s;t into a Lake of Fire, everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels? But how will <HI>you</HI> bear it? How can <HI>your</HI> Heart endure? How can <HI>your</HI> Hands be &s;trong? &mdash; But I forget that I am &s;peaking to a Brother, older, and for ought I know, every Way better than my &s;elf. If you have had your Eyes opened, you will not wonder, nor be offended with me for being &s;o plain and earne&s;t with you: And if you are yet out of CHRIST, it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be too earne&s;t. After all that I or any Man, or Angel, can &s;ay of the Danger of a Chri&s;tle&s;s E&s;tate, the Evil of Sin, the Dreadfulne&s;s of Hell-Torments, the Beauty and Excellency and All-&s;ufficiency of CHRIST, the Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s of a Child of GOD, the Glory of Heaven, &amp;c; the Things them&s;elves will be far above the highe&s;t Ex|pre&s;&s;ions that can be us'd about them.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="006193_0054_1028086E6CCAA4F0">O my dear Brother, I am full of this Matter; the Spirit within me con&s;traineth me to &s;peak. I can hardly help beginning again. I long that all my dear Friends, and my dear Brother <HI>S,</HI> in particular &s;hould come and &s;ee what there is in CHRIST. O that you could know, what I poor Creature have known, of the Sweetne&s;s of Communion with GOD! All the Enjoyments of this World are meer Tra&s;h and Hu&s;ks and Dogs Meat to it. I have enjoyed more &s;olid Satisfaction in one Hour's Communion with GOD, and the ravi&s;hing Sen&s;e of the Love of CHRIST, than all the Comforts of this Life are worth, to be enjoyed for an Age as long as <HI>Methu&s;alem.</HI> I have been &s;o filled with &s;piritual Enjoyments, that I could have no Manner of Reli&s;h for any Thing el&s;e: Riches, Honours, Plea&s;ures &s;eemed like <HI>Dro&s;s and Dung</HI> to me, <HI>in Compari&s;on of the Excellency of the Knowledge and Love of CHRIST JESUS my Lord.</HI> O &s;weet! Sweet! Sweet! Beyond all Expre&s;&s;ion and Compari&s;on. <HI>Eight</HI> Days and Nights have I lain overwhelmed with Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory, and have not &s;lept one Wink, that I was &s;en&s;ible of, Day or Night. Still, &s;till, the Joy of the Lord poured in upon me like a Flood, till Nature was quite overpowered, and Rea&s;on was in great Mea&s;ure drowned: And no wonder; I rather admire that my poor feeble Frame could bear up &s;o long as it did under the Pre&s;&s;ure of &s;uch a Weight of Glory. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have too much lo&s;t a Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things; but I firmly believe they came from GOD as a free Gift to one of the lea&s;t of Mortals and vile&s;t of Sinners, even your poor Si&s;ter <HI>T.</HI> And I expect a Re|vival again in GOD'S Time, and far more abundant Communication; if not in this World, yet when I

come to be with CHRIST, which is be&s;t of all. Then, O then, I expect to have my Capacity enlarged, &s;o as to drink in whole Rivers, Seas, Oceans of the Love of CHRIST for ever. &mdash; And my dear Brother, won't you go along with me? There's enough for you and me, and ten thou&s;and Mi&s;&s;ion more &s;uch; and you are &s;incerely and earne&s;tly invited to come and drink abun|dantly of the Wine of Con&s;olation. <HI>The Spirit and the Bride &s;ay, Come; and who&s;oever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely.</HI> O, my dear Brother, take and drink and live for ever. What I &s;ay to you, I &s;ay to my dear Si&s;ter and Cou&s;ine.
