<P>BUT the matter mu&s;t be further look'd into.</P>
<P>MY Text is found in a Book Entituled, <HI>The Preacher.</HI> It &s;eems, the Things which are in this Book in&s;i&s;ted on, are &s;uch as it well becomes a <HI>Preacher</HI> to in&s;i&s;t upon. We have here the <HI>Re|tractations</HI> of a <HI>Solomon,</HI> writing a Treati&s;e upon, <HI>The Chief End of Man;</HI> An Aged <HI>Solomon,</HI> after much Experience, confe&s;&s;ing his own Errors, and correcting of ours, upon that Important Subject. The Word which we render, <HI>The Preacher,</HI> carries in it &s;ome Intimations of, <HI>A Soul upon Recollection.</HI> We have here that Enquiry managed, <HI>What is
<PB N="3" REF="002913_0005_0FE694E08B3A67A8">true Happine&s;s?</HI> And, <HI>How,</HI> or <HI>Where,</HI> is <HI>true Hap|pine&s;s</HI> is to be met withal! Upon a Serious <HI>Re|collection,</HI> it is here pronounced, That our <HI>Tem|poral Happine&s;s</HI> is to <HI>Enjoy Chearfully</HI> what we <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;s Hone&s;tly.</HI> But, Wo to that Man, who Stops here; who is put off &s;o; who knows none but a <HI>Temporal Happine&s;s.</HI> There is an <HI>Eternal Happine&s;s,</HI> which a Man ought always and chiefly to be concern'd about : An <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> to be found in the Day when <HI>G O D &s;hall bring every work into Judgment.</HI> And the way to obtain this <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> is for a Man to <HI>Fear G O D and keep His Commandments.</HI> In the pro&s;ecution of the&s;e things, very pertinent are the Remarks made in this Book, upon the Di|ver&s;e <HI>Vanities,</HI> whereof Men do in this Life un|dergo the grievous <HI>Vexations.</HI> One of tho&s;e Di|ver&s;e <HI>Vanities,</HI> is Remark'd in the Text before us; <HI>Man knoweth not his Time.</HI> It refers to &s;uch occurrences, as the preceeding Ver&s;e takes notice of. <HI>Time</HI> intends the <HI>Changes</HI> which befalls us in <HI>Time;</HI> The <HI>Changes</HI> which are al&s;o called <HI>Chances,</HI> becau&s;e we &s;ee not the Cau&s;es of them. The <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> as well as the <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> are &s;ecret unto us. But above all, <HI>Time</HI> intends the end of our <HI>Time.</HI> It is our <HI>Death</HI> which is our <HI>Time :</HI> The <HI>Time</HI> wherein we are to <HI>Dy,</HI> and we are to have no more <HI>Time</HI> allow'd unto us. The un|certainty of this <HI>Time,</HI> wherein it plea&s;es the Holy <HI>Lord of Time,</HI> who <HI>Inhabits Eternity</HI> to keep us, has here &s;ome elegant Illu&s;trations and Re|&s;emblances. The <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> Knows not the <HI>Time</HI> of its being taken in the <HI>Nett.</HI> The <HI>Bird</HI> knows not
<PB N="4" REF="002913_0006_0FE694ADECB7C8D0">the <HI>Time</HI> of its being taken in the <HI>Snare;</HI> So are Men <HI>Suddenly</HI> taken by the <HI>Evil-Time</HI> of a <HI>Dying Hour.</HI> The <HI>Netts</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> are &s;pread for us. The <HI>Snares</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> are laid for us. <HI>Man knows not the Time</HI> of his being taken in them.</P>
<P>ATTEND unto a DOCTRINE of an Im|portance as U&s;eful as Awful, to be at <HI>all Times</HI> thought upon.</P>
<P><HI>LITTLE do People know the Times that are hereafter to pa&s;s over them : Little do we know what Changes are to come, and when they are to come upon us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CONTINGENCIES</HI> are Things which we cannot have a <HI>certain knowledge</HI> of. Tis at be&s;t, but an <HI>Opinion,</HI> tis at be&s;t but a <HI>Conjecture,</HI> that we can have of them. Now, with re&s;pect unto <HI>us,</HI> what are all <HI>Futurities,</HI> but <HI>Contingencies.</HI></P>
<P>MY DOCTRINE is a String which the Quill of <HI>Solomon</HI> did very much harp upon. And mo&s;t certainly the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of a <HI>Solomon</HI> could not be expre&s;s'd without Strong Impre&s;&s;ions from &s;uch a Meditation. Tis bewailed by <HI>Solomon</HI> as the <HI>Mi&s;ery of Man,</HI> Eccl. VIII. 7. <HI>He knoweth not that which &s;hall be; For who can tell him when it &s;hall be!</HI> Oh! may we have the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> to make our <HI>Advantage</HI> of this <HI>Mi&s;ery;</HI> &s;ince we do know what we have to do, that we may be pre|pared for <HI>that which &s;hall be.</HI></P>
<P>THIS, This is the Tendency of the Meditation upon which we are now proceeding.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="002913_0007_0FE694E68926F8C8">
<P>WE will Inquire, Fir&s;t, <HI>What is there in the Times pa&s;&s;ing over us, which we mu&s;t not have the Fore-knowledge of?</HI></P>
<P>TWO words will fully eno' expre&s;s the matter.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t LITTLE do we <HI>Fore-know</HI> the <HI>Quantity</HI> of our <HI>Time;</HI> or what will be the <HI>Duration</HI> of it. <HI>Man knoweth not his Time;</HI> in that he <HI>knows not,</HI> whether it will be a <HI>Longer Time,</HI> or a <HI>Shorter Time.</HI> As it has been &s;aid, <HI>What man is he that liveth, and &s;hall not &s;ee Death?</HI> So it may be &s;aid, <HI>What man alive is there, who knows when he &s;hall &s;ee Death?</HI> We are told, <HI>The living know that they &s;hall Dy.</HI> But which of the <HI>Living</HI> are they who <HI>know when they are to Dye?</HI> The <HI>Pre&s;a|ges</HI> that &s;ome few have had of their <HI>Time,</HI> are extraordinary! One &s;aid, Gen XXVII. 2. <HI>I am old, I know not the Day of my Death.</HI> And the <HI>Young</HI> does as little <HI>know the Day of his Death.</HI> It is an ancient &s;aying, <HI>If an old Man has Death &s;tanding before his Face, a young Man has Death &s;tanding behind his Back.</HI> The <HI>Time</HI> of its giving the <HI>Fatal &s;troke,</HI> is as little known to the one, as to the other. <HI>One that is in his full &s;trength, being wholly at ea&s;e and quiet, and having his Bones moi&s;tned with morrow;</HI> Even &s;uch an one does <HI>not know his Time;</HI> for even &s;uch an one may <HI>Dy</HI> at <HI>this</HI> very <HI>Time. One that is in Bitterne&s;s of Soul, and never Eats with plea&s;ure,</HI> becau&s;e of the Infirmities under what he langui&s;hes; even &s;uch an one al&s;o does <HI>not know his Time.</HI> For even &s;uch an one may be Repriev'd from <HI>Death</HI> beyond expectation; and &s;ee many <HI>Stronger</HI> ones <HI>ly down in the Du&s;t</HI> before him. We do all know, That <HI>it
<PB N="6" REF="002913_0008_0FE694AE521958B8">is appointed unto man once to dy.</HI> But which of us does <HI>know his appointed Time</HI> for it; or when he is to <HI>Dy?</HI> Ordinarily, <HI>of that Day &amp; Hour knoweth no Man.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, LITTLE do we <HI>Foreknow</HI> the <HI>Qua|lity</HI> of our <HI>Time;</HI> or what we are to <HI>Encounter</HI> in it. Shall we have a <HI>Good Time,</HI> or a <HI>Bad Time</HI> of it? <HI>Man knoweth not!</HI> In our <HI>Time</HI> &s;hall we &s;ee Days of <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> or Days of <HI>Sorrow? Man know|eth not!</HI> Shall we have our <HI>Time</HI> &s;weetned with much <HI>Pro&s;perity,</HI> or embittered with much <HI>Ad|ver&s;ity? Man knoweth not!</HI> The World may not prove either &s;o <HI>Good</HI> as we <HI>hope,</HI> or &s;o <HI>Bad</HI> as we <HI>fear?</HI> 'Tis mo&s;t commonly &s;o. Some look for a <HI>&s;adder Time</HI> than ever does arrive unto them. So did the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Hero, when he &s;aid, <HI>I &s;hall one day peri&s;h by the hand of Saul.</HI> But much oft|ner do Men look for a <HI>better Time,</HI> than what anon comes unto them. They &s;ay, <HI>I &s;hall never be moved;</HI> But, GOD <HI>hides His Face, and they are Troubled.</HI> When <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was a Pri&s;oner and his <HI>Foot they did humble with the affliction of a chain; The Iron, that did penetrate into his very Soul:</HI> Did he <HI>know</HI> what was to be done for him, when the King <HI>constituted him to be the Ruler of his Hou&s;e; yea, and the Governour of all that was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by him.</HI> When <HI>Haman</HI> was in all the Grandeur of the <HI>Per&s;ion</HI> Court, and the chief Mi|ni&s;ter of State there; Did he <HI>know</HI> how near he and his Family were, to a matchle&s;s confu&s;ion? What <HI>Accidents</HI> we are to meet withal, whether <HI>Joyful</HI> Accidents, or <HI>Woful</HI> Accidents, we mu&s;t not <HI>know,</HI> indeed &s;o much as one day before hand.
<PB N="7" REF="002913_0009_0FE694E6A31A2908">So we are admoni&s;hed; Prov. XXVII. 1. <HI>Thou knowe&s;t not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> O Man, Thou <HI>knowe&s;t not,</HI> what may <HI>This Day</HI> befall thee in thy Per&s;on, in thy Family, in thy Intere&s;t. Thou <HI>knowest not</HI> what may be the <HI>Tidings</HI> that will <HI>This Day</HI> be brought unto thee. Thou <HI>know|e&s;t not</HI> in the <HI>Evening</HI> what may befall thee be|fore the <HI>Morning,</HI> or in the <HI>Morning</HI> what &s;hall befall thee before the <HI>Evening;</HI> Any more than the Men upon whom the <HI>Tower of Siloam fell,</HI> that the <HI>Tower</HI> was to fall, while they were un|der it.</P>
<P>THE Articles wherein you have had &s;et be|fore you, the <HI>Future Events</HI> of our <HI>Times,</HI> where|of our GOD will keep us in the greate&s;t <HI>Uncer|tainties,</HI> are then the&s;e Two; Fir&s;t, That which is the greate&s;t of all our <HI>Changes;</HI> And, then, all the <HI>Changes</HI> which may before That come up|on us. Our Meditation mu&s;t not ea&s;ily, and pre|&s;ently di&s;mi&s;s the&s;e Articles of our <HI>Times</HI> which are <HI>unknown</HI> unto us. But before we pa&s;s any further, Let an earne&s;t EXHORTATION pre|vail with us, To <HI>Entertain this Meditation, and he duely affected with it.</HI> Oh! may this Thought be often rolling in our Minds; <HI>I know not my Time, nor do I know any thing that is to befal me in my Time!</HI> And may our Minds feel the power of it; bring our Lives under the power of it! The very <HI>Pagans</HI> would &s;ometimes give an Entertain|ment unto this Meditation; and &s;ay, <HI>Ne&s;cis quid &s;erus Ve&s;per vebat;</HI> O Man, Thou knowe&s;t not what may before Night be to come upon thee. Certainly, It becomes <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to give a more
<PB N="8" REF="002913_0010_0FE694B7265998B0">affecting entertainment unto &s;uch a Meditation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; THE ca&s;e of <HI>Mortality</HI> is above all to be thus con&s;idered; That <HI>Man knows not his Time,</HI> when his <HI>Mortality</HI> mu&s;t have the Opera|tion of it fini&s;hed. Man lies under a <HI>Sentence</HI> of <HI>Death;</HI> and the <HI>Time</HI> for <HI>Execution</HI> is <HI>determined</HI> with GOD; <HI>Lord, The number of our Months is with thee; Thou ha&s;t appointed our Bounds, that we cannot pa&s;s.</HI> But Man mu&s;t not <HI>know the Time,</HI> until the Executioner come and bring the Bow-&s;tring. There is no <HI>Day</HI> that breaks upon any Man, but for ought he <HI>knows, His Time is come, and the Day of his Death. Sudden Deaths</HI> are &s;ome of tho&s;e Things, whereto all Men living are expo&s;ed. We find it &s;uppo&s;ed, Numb VI. 9. <HI>A man may die very &s;uddenly.</HI> 'Tis what we &s;ee fulfill'd on great <HI>Numbers;</HI> We need not for the proof of it quote the Book of <HI>Numbers.</HI> The commi&s;&s;ions which our glotious GOD gives to the <HI>Angel of Death</HI> are often kept &s;ecret until the very Day, that he comes and &s;wears unto them, <HI>No more Time</HI> &s;hall be given them. It may be the Portion of <HI>Wicked Men</HI> to <HI>Dy &s;uddenly.</HI> The profane Men, who can &s;ay of the Thing they never once thought upon, <HI>They thought no more of it than of their Dying Day;</HI> find it according to their word; Their <HI>Dying Day</HI> comes at a <HI>Time</HI> which they <HI>thought not</HI> of. The Men of <HI>Sodom;</HI> Did they <HI>know their Time?</HI> A bright fair, Sun|&s;hiny Morning, found them wallowing in all Im|purities; Before Night the <HI>Vengeance of Eternal Fire</HI> came down upon them. The <HI>Egyptians;</HI> Did they <HI>know their Time?</HI> In the Morning
<PB N="9" REF="002913_0011_0FE694E8F06FA880">they were full of brave Expectations to divide <HI>Spoils</HI> and <HI>Slaves</HI> among them, and to do won|drous Exploits. That Night they were Drown'd, and Damn'd; the <HI>Sea covered them.</HI> The <HI>Phi|listines;</HI> Did they <HI>know their Time?</HI> In the Morning they had nothing in their Eye, but the <HI>Sports</HI> of an Holiday. E're the Night came, they were cru&s;h'd all to pieces. <HI>Ananias &amp; Sapphira;</HI> Did they <HI>know their Time.</HI> They came out well to the Meeting, and they are carried home Dead! It may be the Portion of <HI>Godly Men</HI> al&s;o to <HI>Dy &s;uddenly.</HI> It may be a Privilege granted by GOD unto &s;ome of His mo&s;t Favoured ones, to <HI>Dy</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Death. Uzzah,</HI> Did he <HI>know his Time;</HI> In the Morning of the Day, when the <HI>Ark</HI> was to be carried into the City of <HI>David?</HI> or, The Prophet &s;ent unto <HI>Jeroboam;</HI> Did he <HI>know his Time,</HI> in the Morning of the Day when the <HI>Lion</HI> fell upon him? Others le&s;s obnoxious find it &s;o.</P>
<P>Yea, Secondly; THE Ca&s;e of every <HI>Calamity</HI> is thus to be con&s;idered. <HI>Man knows not his Time,</HI> when that <HI>Calamity</HI> will befal him, wherein GOD will <HI>perform the Thing that is appointed for him.</HI> One that has an <HI>Husband,</HI> or a <HI>Father,</HI> in the Morn|ing, does not <HI>know,</HI> but before Night, the &s;tate of a <HI>Widow,</HI> or an <HI>Orphan</HI> may be Theirs: The <HI>Sun</HI> may <HI>&s;et at Noon</HI> with us, and leave us in a <HI>Sud|den Darkne&s;s.</HI> A <HI>Job</HI> has his <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> full of <HI>Chil|dren</HI> in the Morning; but he does not know that before Night, he &s;hall have neither <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> nor <HI>Children</HI> left unto him. In this evil World, every Man knows, that his Dependence may be like that of the Apo&s;tles, <HI>Afflictions wait for me:</HI> But
<PB N="10" REF="002913_0012_0FE694B7460100A8">then he mu&s;t add like the Apo&s;tle. Act. XX. 22. <HI>Not knowing the Things that &s;hall befal me.</HI> And much more, <HI>Not knowing the Time when they &s;hall befal me.</HI></P>
<P>IT was counted a Flight of Wi&s;dom; <HI>All that I know, is that I know nothing!</HI> It will be wi&s;ely done of us to make the <HI>knowledge</HI> of our <HI>Igno|rance</HI> in this point, as efficacious as may be upon us; <HI>This I know, that man knoweth not his Time.</HI></P>
<P>WE will enquire, Secondly; <HI>Whence is it, that we mu&s;t not have the Fore-knowledge of the Times that are to pa&s;s over us?</HI></P>
<P>Now, Fir&s;t; THERE is for it, the <HI>Fir&s;t Rea&s;on</HI> of all things; the grand <HI>Rea&s;on of all Rea&s;ons.</HI> The <HI>Sovereign will</HI> of GOD; That is <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> enough. The <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of the Great GOD will be maintained in it. It was a ju&s;t Acknow|ledgment; P&s;al. XXXI. 15. <HI>O Lord, my Times are in thy Hand.</HI> It was a ju&s;t Admonition; Act. I. 7. <HI>It is not for you to know the Times, which the Father has put in His own power.</HI> All that &s;hall befall us in our <HI>Times,</HI> is Decreed by the GOD that made us. Now, the <HI>Decree</HI> is by our So|vereign kept a <HI>Secret:</HI> For <HI>&s;uch is His will and plea&s;ure,</HI> that it &s;hould be &s;o. There is a Glori|ous One, who is in our Tran&s;lation of the Bible, called, <HI>The Ancient of Days.</HI> The Original is, <HI>The Appointer of Times.</HI> 'Tis fit, that our <HI>Times</HI> remain <HI>unknown</HI> to any but Him that has the <HI>Appointing</HI> of the <HI>Times.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, there is more than this to be &s;aid of the matter.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="002913_0013_0FE694E9114DDAF8">
<P>Fir&s;t, IT is from the <HI>Pitty</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> of our Gracious GOD unto the poor Children of Men, that they mu&s;t not <HI>know their Time,</HI> nor what is to befall them in their <HI>Time.</HI></P>
<P>IT may well be a&s;cribed unto the <HI>Pitty</HI> of our GOD, That we do <HI>not know our Time;</HI> For &s;uch <HI>a knowledge</HI> would very much de&s;troy the <HI>comfort</HI> of our <HI>Time;</HI> very much make for us a mo&s;t un|comfortable <HI>Time,</HI> Here, Here, mo&s;t emphati|cally; <HI>He that increa&s;eth Knowledge increa&s;eth Sorrow.</HI> It would mightily take away the <HI>com|fort</HI> which we take in any thing under the Sun, if we knew aforehand, <HI>When</HI> and <HI>How</HI> we are to take our leave of that <HI>comfort.</HI> It is reported concerning <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> 2 King. VIII. 11, 12. <HI>The man of God wept; And Hazael &s;aid, Why weepeth my Lord? And he an&s;wered, Becau&s;e I know the evil, that thou wilt do.</HI> Thus, If a Man <HI>know the evil Time</HI> that is to befall him&s;elf, or his Hou&s;e, and the <HI>Time</HI> of the <HI>Evil,</HI> he would fall a <HI>weeping</HI> at it; into &s;uch a <HI>weeping,</HI> that he would be able to find little Reli&s;h in the gifts of GOD unto him. The <HI>Anticipations</HI> of <HI>Trouble</HI> would break the Hearts of Men, if they knew before hand all the <HI>Trouble</HI> that is to come upon them, and the <HI>Time</HI> when it will come.

Betimes, Quickly, Pre|&s;ently, without any Delay, make a &s;urrender of thy &s;elf and thy All unto me.</HI> But now, the SINNER puts off his cares to <HI>get into the Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of GOD, until all his <HI>Youth</HI> have been &s;pent in the <HI>way of his own heart,</HI> and <HI>Satan</HI> his had his <HI>Mar|row,</HI> and he begins to feel <HI>De&s;truction coming as a Whirlwind</HI> upon him. <HI>Then</HI> he thinks 'tis <HI>Early</HI> enough to become a <HI>Seeker</HI> of GOD. This, This is the EARLY, which <HI>Mercy</HI> is denied unto. This the <HI>Early,</HI> which the Abu&s;ed <HI>Patience</HI> of GOD will not permit the <HI>Sinner</HI> to find <HI>Mercy</HI> in! You know the con&s;equence. Oh! <HI>Be per|&s;waded, knewing the Terror of the Lord.</HI></P>

<P>BUT I leave the work in the hands of another <HI>Preacher,</HI> and a flaming one. 'Tis a <HI>Preacher</HI> that will go home with you; and there I intreat you <HI>to Hearken unto him, that GOD may hearken unto you another Day.</HI> Let <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> now do its office. I refer the whole I&s;&s;ue to the <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> of the Hearer; and I be&s;eech you, that you would in a due Retirement this very Evening, hear what your <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> will &s;peak upon this point; <HI>What &s;hould be done by One who does not know his Time, nor know whether he &s;hall have one Day more, to do what he has to do, that he may be Happy to all ETERNITY.</HI></P>
