<HEAD>To the Honourable Judge SEWALL.</HEAD>
<P>THE ESSAY now before you, was made, becau&s;e you have been Exerci&s;ed with &s;ome Funerals in your Family; and e&s;pecially One of a <HI>Daughter,</HI> falling Suddenly into the Arms of <HI>Death,</HI> a few Days after &s;he had comforted you with the <HI>Birth</HI> of her Fir&s;t|born Infant.</P>
<P><HI>Au&s;tin</HI> makes it his comfortable Ob&s;ervation, That when Good Men are <HI>in Mourning,</HI> or under any Calamity, they have Good Men at hand with Con&s;olations. <HI>Ad &s;unt Boni Homines, qui flere cum flentibus norunt;</HI> and &s;o, <HI>Leniuntur A&s;pera, relevantur Gravia, et Su|perantur Adver&s;a.</HI> T'wil be a Favour to me, if I may be found a|mong tho&s;e <HI>Boni Homines,</HI> who do the part of your Friends on &s;uch occa&s;ions. I &s;hall, if a mo&s;t hearty Affection to you and yours, and <HI>Weeping with you and them,</HI> can declare me &s;o.</P>
<P>It was notably Propo&s;ed by <HI>Tully</HI> to his <HI>Atticus; Con&s;olationum multae &s;unt viae; &s;ed illa recti&s;&s;ima, Impetret</HI> Ratio <HI>quod</HI> Dies <HI>impetra|tura e&s;t.</HI> This his Propo&s;al, That <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> without an <HI>Higher Prin|ciple,</HI> &s;hould <HI>Immediately</HI> do that in a way of <HI>Con&s;olation,</HI> which <HI>Length of Time</HI> u&s;es to do, with a longer &amp; more tedious Procedure, is, <HI>To wa&s;h an Ethiopian.</HI> And it is related by <HI>Plutarch</HI> accordingly, concerning this Pretender to <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> That when his Daughter <HI>Tulliola</HI> died, <HI>Mortem indigni&s;&s;ime tulit.</HI></P>
<P>You are furni&s;hed with the <HI>Higher Principle</HI> of RELIGION; and you are acquainted with the <HI>Great Con&s;olations of GOD,</HI> which you know how to apply on the proper occa&s;ions. <HI>The&s;e will do.</HI></P>
<P>As the <HI>Chymi&s;ts</HI> tell us, That <HI>Nature</HI> by <HI>Length of Time</HI> changes one Metal into another; but their Skill and Boa&s;t is to Accelerate the Endeavours of <HI>Nature,</HI> and Ha&s;ten <HI>at Once</HI> the Effect, which el&s;e
<PB REF="001467_0003_0FB34ABCEC972170">
would have been a very long while producing. Thus, <HI>Religion</HI> will with much more certainty <HI>at Once</HI> bring about that Victory over Sorrow, and fix the Mind in that <HI>Golden Temper,</HI> which el&s;e would not be &s;o &s;oon accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>For your A&s;&s;i&s;tence in that <HI>Work of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> You have called for a Copy of my E&s;&s;ay; which now wears a Name, that may &s;ignify, <HI>The Con&s;olations of GOD;</HI> and it was my Duty to let it wait upon you.</P>
<P>I Remember Two Pa&s;&s;ages in an <HI>Epi&s;tle Con&s;olatory,</HI> of the Great <HI>Grotius</HI> unto the Baron <HI>Maurier,</HI> on the Death of a Relative, which I thought not unworthy to be Remembred, and now Repeted.</P>
<P>The One is; <HI>Confer now with the Dead, and Peru&s;e BOOKS with greater Diligence than ever. BOOKS will not only give you a Safe Retreat from the Fury of your Enemy, but will arm you al&s;o again&s;t the Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>The Other is, <HI>I am a&s;&s;ured, there can be no better Remedy applied unto Sorrow, than that which the Great Phy&s;ician of Souls, among the infinite Trea&s;ures of Saving Wi&s;dom, has brought down from Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, a Little <HI>Book,</HI> which pre&s;ents you with the&s;e be&s;t of <HI>Remedies.</HI></P>
<P>It was the Cu&s;tom of my Memorable Grand-father COTTON, to Read Something of his mo&s;t valuable &amp; venerable CALVIN, in his Evening Studies; for which he would &s;ay, <HI>I love to &s;weeten my Mouth, with a piece of</HI> CALVIN, <HI>before I go to Sleep.</HI> I know, you love your Incomparable CALVIN, as much as the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Pe|lagians,</HI> and <HI>High fliers,</HI> do Hate him; and you are a Great Reader of him. To &s;uch a <HI>Calvini&s;t,</HI> it will not be Ungrateful for me, (who am one too) to recite the&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ages, from a Sermon of his, upon that Paragraph in <HI>Job,</HI> from whence the <HI>Text</HI> of mine is taken.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, this. <HI>Sedulo notemus, nobis Perplexis et Anxijs nihil Supere&s;&s;e, quo Tranquillitatem Con&s;equamur, ni&s;i ut Deus nos Pacatos, et Contentos reddat; quod Beneficium, Pluris facere quam caetera omnia, debemus. Deus Se&s;e modo o&s;tendat, et &s;tatim Turbae omnes di&s;cutientur.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd, this. <HI>Hoc autem in Praxi magis quam in verbis con&s;i&s;tit; Nam qui ad Deum confugiunt, norunt quanti &s;int Con&s;olationes, et quantum ad nos Pacandos valeant.</HI> With this Piece of CALVIN, I take leave; and Sub&s;cribe,</P>

<HEAD>NEHEMIAH. OR, THE GREAT <HI>Con&s;olations of</HI> GOD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOB XV. 11.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Are the Con&s;olations of <HI>GOD,</HI> Small with thee?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a Smart Que&s;tion! And it is a Matter of <HI>no Small</HI> Sor|row, <HI>no Small</HI> Horror, that we generally afford &s;o <HI>Great</HI> Rea|&s;on, to be rebuked with &s;uch a Que&s;tion. The Rebuke may be more ju&s;tly given to <HI>us,</HI> than it was to <HI>Job,</HI> the Upright and Patient Servant of the Lord. A man enough to have made any <HI>Arabia</HI> the <HI>Happy,</HI> by his Illuminating of it; and yet a Man greatly Mi&s;con&s;trued, Cen&s;ured, Reproached. We have the Story of him in a <HI>Poem,</HI> which had an <HI>Hi&s;torical Foundation;</HI> whe|ther <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> wrote the <HI>Poem</HI> or no, for the comfort of his Country|men, while he was yet among the <HI>Midianites,</HI> cannot be deter|mined. It may, that <HI>Senault</HI> &s;ayes true, <HI>No Book in the World, is nobler in Expre&s;&s;ions, richer in De&s;criptions, more generous in Concep|tions, or more natural in Compari&s;ons.</HI> The Friends of this rare man, too Angry &amp; Froward ones! had been coun&s;elling of him, to Turn from the <HI>Impiety</HI> and <HI>Hypocri&s;y,</HI> whereof they would needs, upon cau&s;e little enough, &s;u&s;pect him to be Guilty. They had been comfor|ting of him al&s;o with Hopes to find Favour with God upon his Turn. He endeavours his own <HI>Vindication</HI> from the Su&s;picion of his
<PB N="2" REF="001467_0005_0FB34ABFA56355B8">
Friends: His ju&s;t <HI>Vindication,</HI> does but add unto the <HI>Irritation.</HI> So tis, when men Re&s;olve, that nothing &s;hall &s;atisfy them! They mi&s;interpret him, as if he had Rejected the <HI>Encouragements</HI> of Re|turning to GOD, which they had &s;et before him. The <HI>Expo&s;tula|tion</HI> on this occa&s;ion (made, as <HI>Mercer</HI> thinks, with State enough!) is this; <HI>Are the Con&s;olations of God Small with thee?</HI> The Inten|tion of it, is well expre&s;&s;ed by the Incomparable <HI>Calvin; Si quid tale aliquis committerit, merito haberetur &s;uperbus, et Dei Gratiae contemptor non ferendus.</HI> In &s;hort, Intolerable the <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Ingra|titude</HI> of doing &s;o. Whatever mi&s;take there might be in their Ap|plication to the cen&s;ured Servant of God, I will &s;ee, that there &s;hall be no mi&s;take in my Application of the Words, unto the purpo&s;e of the DOCTRINE, which I am going to take into my Hands.</P>
<P>Tis this,
<Q>Very Great are the Provocations of Men unto <HI>GOD,</HI> when the Con&s;olations of <HI>GOD</HI> are but Small unto them.</Q></P>
<P>If the <HI>Con&s;olations of</HI> GOD appear <HI>Little</HI> to us, our <HI>Indi&s;cretion</HI> is more than a <HI>Little;</HI> our <HI>Iniquity</HI> more than a <HI>Little.</HI> When the <HI>Con&s;olations of</HI> GOD are of <HI>Small</HI> Account with men, or make <HI>Little Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> on them, have <HI>Little Efficacy</HI> on them, tis a <HI>Sign</HI> and a <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of <HI>no Small Evil</HI> in them; of more than a Little <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Evil</HI> in them.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Three A&s;&s;ertions</HI> to be advanced and maintained. When we have E&s;tabli&s;hed our <HI>Three A&s;&s;ertions,</HI> we &s;hall be ready to bring on a very <HI>forcible Expo&s;tulation,</HI> with &s;ome <HI>Right words,</HI> wherein it will be well, if we don't find our &s;elves all concerned.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> There are <HI>Con&s;olations of</HI> GOD, belonging unto all the People of God; offered unto all the Children of Men. <HI>Comfortable things</HI> are to be Enjoy'd by all <HI>Good Men;</HI> The Enjoyment of tho&s;e <HI>Com|fortable Things</HI> is tendered unto <HI>all men.</HI></P>
<P>I will pre&s;ently tell you <HI>What</HI> the&s;e <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> are. But I can|not well come to thee until we fir&s;t of all take Notice <HI>Who&s;e</HI> they are.</P>
<P>Take Notice then, in the fir&s;t Place, That all <HI>True Con&s;olations</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="001467_0006_0FB34AC1C7FC24C8">
are the <HI>Con&s;olations of</HI> GOD. We read, 2 Cor. I. 3. <HI>He is the God of all Comfort.</HI> There are <HI>Comfortable Creatures; Comforts</HI> in <HI>Crea|tures:</HI> But they are no further &s;o, than GOD &s;hall plea&s;e to make them &s;o. All <HI>Creatures</HI> otherwi&s;e at the be&s;t, are but <HI>Mi&s;erable Comforters.</HI> The Great GOD has more Sublime, Cele&s;tial, Rap|turous <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> for us, than any of this World; <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> of a Finer Compo&s;ition, than any this World can afford <HI>Matter</HI> for. Indeed &s;ome Interpreters as old as the <HI>Vulgar Latin,</HI> thus carry the Sen&s;e of the clau&s;e, I am now Preaching upon; q. d. <HI>Is it not an ea&s;y thing with God to Comfort thee?</HI> And if we do find any <HI>Con|&s;olations</HI> in any Entertainments, which this World may afford unto us, they &s;till are <HI>Gifts</HI> of GOD; <HI>the Things which</HI> GOD <HI>has graci|ou&s;ly given to His Servant!</HI> They are <HI>Con&s;olations,</HI> which GOD has provided; and they would not have the lea&s;t Reli&s;h of <HI>Con&s;olati|ons</HI> in them, if GOD &s;hould not enable us to reli&s;h them. We read, Job XXXIV. 29. <HI>When He gives Quietne&s;s, who then can make Trou|ble? And when He hides His Face, who then can behold Him?</HI> I will &s;ay, If GOD withold Con&s;olations, who is there that can Pretend to <HI>Comfort?</HI> Indeed the Be&s;t Things in the World, without GOD, are but as <HI>Luther</HI> Elegantly called them, <HI>Con&s;olatiunculae creaturulae:</HI> Very Diminutive Con&s;olations! Abundance of <HI>Duty,</HI> will imme|diately ari&s;e unto us from this Acknowledgment.</P>
<P>Would we be made Partakers of any <HI>Con&s;olations?</HI> Go to GOD for them. Tru&s;t in GOD for them. Keep in Good Terms with GOD. O all you, who De&s;ire <HI>Comfort;</HI> Do not <HI>Offend</HI> GOD, if you would have Him to <HI>Comfort</HI> you. All <HI>Comfort</HI> is lo&s;t and gone and Confi&s;cated, when we ly under the <HI>Anger</HI> of GOD. Are we made Partakers of any Con&s;olations? O <HI>Comforted</HI> Ones; Own them to be the Con&s;olations of GOD. Give GOD the Glory of them; Glorify GOD, as the Author and Giver of them.</P>
<P>I am now ready to Proceed on my E&s;&s;ay, to declare, <HI>What</HI> are the Con&s;olations of GOD?</P>
<P>Inexpre&s;&s;ible <HI>Con&s;olations!</HI> All that we can <HI>Expre&s;s</HI> of them, is only in &s;ome General Heads, whereof we have been advi&s;ed from the <HI>Lively Oracles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001467_0007_0FB34AC2A34330F0">Fir&s;t; There are <HI>Con&s;olations of</HI> GOD, in the PROMISES, which the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, has made unto the Godly. The Lord gave that order of old; <HI>Comfort ye, comfort ye my People, &s;aith your God; Speak ye comfortably to them!</HI> Ah, Lord, Thou ha&s;t thy &s;elf in thy Word, mo&s;t graciou&s;ly, and marvellou&s;ly done &s;o! The <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD &amp; of Grace, is made up of Con&s;olations. The Words of GOD in this <HI>Covenant,</HI> are tho&s;e whereof we may &s;ay, as in Zech. I. 13. <HI>They are good Words, and comfortable Words.</HI> It is in the Sacred Scriptures, that we have this <HI>comfortable Covenant;</HI> and we are in|formed, Rom. XV. 4. Of, <HI>The comfort of the Scriptures.</HI> There are <HI>Very Great and Precious Promi&s;es</HI> in the Word of GOD. The <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> gives a Man, a claim to the&s;e <HI>Promi&s;es; Promi&s;es</HI> both for the <HI>Life that now is,</HI> and for the <HI>Life that is to come.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> are &s;o many <HI>Brea&s;ts of Con&s;olation.</HI> Can it be any other than a Con|&s;olation, to under&s;tand, That we have an Al&s;ufficient CHRIST, for our Healer, and Helper and Refuge? This Con&s;olation <HI>of</HI> GOD is given unto them that have the <HI>Fear of</HI> GOD. We read, Mal. IV. 2. <HI>Unto you that fear my Name &s;hall the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;e with Healing in His Wings.</HI> What a Con&s;olation mu&s;t it be to un|der&s;tand, That the ANGELS of Heaven, &s;hall alwayes be Watching and Working for our Good? The Fear of God will Entitle us to this Con&s;olation of GOD. We read; P&s;al. XXXIV. 7. <HI>The An|gel of the Lord Encampeth round about them that fear Him, to deliver them.</HI> Is it not a Con&s;olation, to under&s;tand, That we &s;hall want no Good Thing? They that Fear God have this Con&s;olation of GOD. We read; P&s;al. XXXIV. 9, 10. <HI>O Fear the Lord, Ye His Saints, for there is no want to them that fear Him. &mdash; They that Seek the Lord, &s;hall not want any Good Thing.</HI> &mdash; But, what &s;hall we &s;ay? The <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of GOD, are Big with all the Con&s;olations Imagi|nable; with Con&s;olations beyond all Imagination. They that are the <HI>Heirs of the Promi&s;es,</HI> Verily, they are the <HI>Heirs of Con&s;olations.</HI> Take the <HI>Sum</HI> of the Con&s;olations; the <HI>Sum</HI> of all Con&s;olations; P&s;al. LXXXIV. 11. <HI>The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield; the Lord will give Grace &amp; Glory; no Good thing will He withold from them that walk uprightly.</HI> O COVENANT of GOD! What an Inexhau&s;ti|ble Mine of Con&s;olations art thou!</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001467_0008_0FB34AC42EA2E378">Secondly. There are <HI>Con&s;olations of</HI> GOD, in the PLEASURES of PIETY; the <HI>Comforts</HI> which naturally re&s;ult from a <HI>Pious Life.</HI> We read concerning the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of <HI>Piety,</HI> Prov. III. 17. <HI>Her wayes are wayes of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths are peace.</HI> It is mo&s;t certain; The wayes of <HI>Piety,</HI> are ways of <HI>Plea&s;ancy.</HI> Ah, my Young People; when you have thought, that the ways of <HI>Religion,</HI> were Severe, Au&s;tere, Moro&s;e, and <HI>Melancholy</HI> wayes; That you mu&s;t never See a <HI>cheerful Minute</HI> more, after you become <HI>Seriou&s;ly Religious;</HI> It was a <HI>Lying Devil</HI> which told you &s;o: <HI>Believe him not;</HI> His lyes are full of <HI>Abominations.</HI> True PIETY, I tell you truly, tis attended with the mo&s;t Enviable <HI>Con&s;olations!</HI> We read; P&s;al. CXXXVIII. 5. <HI>They &s;hall Sing in the wayes of the Lord.</HI> If we might envy the Con&s;olations of any man Living, it &s;hould be the man who <HI>Exerci&s;es him&s;elf to keep a Con&s;cience void of offence to|wards God, and towards Man.</HI> There is a <HI>Continual Fea&s;t</HI> in &s;uch a <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI> No wicked man ever knows any Delights comparable to tho&s;e, wherein that man is continually bathing him&s;elf, who daily <HI>Delights him&s;elf in God. Innocency</HI> is accompanied with <HI>Sere|nity.</HI> Sirs, would you arrive to matchle&s;s <HI>Con&s;olations?</HI> Hate all Sin; Shun all Sin; Mourn for it, when overtaken with it; Con|ver&s;e with GOD; Be full of Zeal to improve in the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of God, and the <HI>Image</HI> of God; and be alwayes <HI>at Work</HI> for God. Be fill'd with Benevolence, and Beneficence towards MEN: Have compa&s;&s;ion on all the Afflicted; Scatter your <HI>Alms</HI> like the Showres of Heaven; Be Serviceable to every one on all occa&s;ions; with un&s;peakable Raptures of Goodne&s;s, watch for all occa&s;ions. This <HI>Walk with God,</HI> will be a <HI>Plea&s;ant Walk;</HI> No <HI>Eden</HI> has any that e|quals it. There is a certain <HI>Symphony</HI> and <HI>Harmony</HI> with <HI>Heaven</HI> in &s;uch a <HI>Walk.</HI> The Con&s;olations of it, are <HI>Wonderful! Wonder|ful!</HI> They that keep clo&s;e to the ways of God, are <HI>Children of Light.</HI> There is a <HI>Light of God</HI> &s;hining upon their ways, and into their Minds. No words can paint out the <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> of this <HI>Light!</HI> Blind Sinner, I cannot make thee apprehend this <HI>Light.</HI> Oh! That thou woulde&s;t <HI>Come and See!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001467_0009_0FB34AC674876340">Thirdly. There are <HI>Con&s;olations of</HI> GOD, in the ASSURAN|CES, with which the <HI>Sealed Souls</HI> of Believers are &s;ometimes <HI>Com|forted of God.</HI> I know, this will be derided as <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> with the Sons of <HI>Profanene&s;s&punc;</HI> But it is very &s;ure; The SPIRIT of GOD is the COMFORTER of them who belong unto Him. There is upon the Hearts of the Faithful a Work of that Holy Spirit, which is called, <HI>A Sealing Work.</HI> Of that work we read; Eph. IV. 30. <HI>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are Sealed unto the Day of Redemption.</HI> Oh! the Refined <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> of a Soul <HI>Sealed</HI> by the Holy Spirit of God! The Spirit of God fir&s;t imprints upon the Mind of a Chri&s;tian, the infallible <HI>Marks,</HI> of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and <HI>Re|conciliation,</HI> and of an Heir&s;hip to a <HI>Crown of Life.</HI> He then gives the Believer a <HI>Sight</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Marks;</HI> and fills him with the Con&s;o|lations which belong to a <HI>Regenerate</HI> and <HI>Reconciled</HI> State; fills him with <HI>Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory.</HI> No Tongue is able to utter the <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> of a Mind, whom the Holy Spirit of GOD <HI>Irradiates</HI> with a Per&s;wa&s;ion and A&s;&s;urance, of an Intere&s;t in the Special Fa|vour of God. The Holy SPIRIT of God, often a&s;&s;ures the Peni|tent Sinner of His Mercy to him; and &s;ayes, as in Math. IX. 2. <HI>Child, Be of Good cheer, thy Sins be forgiven thee.</HI> Oh! the Con&s;o|lations of a <HI>Pardoned Penitent!</HI> The <HI>Electing,</HI> the <HI>Redeeming,</HI> the <HI>Pardoning Love</HI> of God, is often Powerfully brought home, unto tho&s;e who are Watchful, Fruitful, <HI>Holy in all manner of Conver&s;ation.</HI> The Holy SPIRIT, with a Powerful Satisfaction tells him, <HI>Thou art a Child of God! God has loved thee with an Everla&s;ting love; and as a Token of it, He has enkindled in thy Heart a vehement Flame of Love to Him.</HI> He tells him; <HI>Thou ha&s;t made choice of God for thy Portion; But God fir&s;t cho&s;e thee for One of His People.</HI> He tells him; <HI>Thou ha&s;t given thy &s;elf unto thy Redeemer; But God the Father fir&s;t gave thee unto Him.</HI> He tells him; <HI>Thy Sins are all become lothe&s;ome to thee; The Death of thy Sins, is to thy Soul, a Ble&s;&s;ing bet|ter than Life it &s;elf. Tis a Token from God, that thy Sins are all For|given thee.</HI> Can any <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> be equal unto the&s;e? Methinks, one &s;o Comforted of God, cannot but fall into <HI>Exta&s;ies!</HI> The <HI>Con|&s;olations of God,</HI> will make him to &s;ing; I&s;a. XII. 1. <HI>O Lord, I will

What will my Glorious Father Plea&s;e to do with me! Lord, I am Thine! Lord, Thou art Mine! My Father will never leave off to do me Good: He will guide me by Coun&s;il, and bring me to Glory. Oh! my Father, and my Saviour; what &s;hall I render to thee?</Q></P>
<P>There is one Remark to be made on the <HI>Special Sea&s;on</HI> in which there u&s;es to be a Grant of &s;uch Con&s;olations. The Sovereign Lord of all, di&s;pen&s;es the Con&s;olations when He Plea&s;es. But yet; Are we Rai&s;ed unto &s;ome <HI>Exerci&s;e of Grace,</HI> in an uncommon Ele|vation? A <HI>Victory</HI> over Hideous <HI>Temptations?</HI> A <HI>Forgivene&s;s</HI> unto cruel <HI>Enemies?</HI> A <HI>Re&s;ignation</HI> to the will of God in <HI>Grievous Events?</HI> Are we <HI>Patient</HI> under heavy <HI>Trials?</HI> Are we <HI>Plea&s;ed</HI> with <HI>Sufferings</HI> for the Cau&s;e, the Word, the Day of God? Are we Glad, Glad of any <HI>Conformity</HI> to our <HI>Saviour,</HI> tho' in the mo&s;t Aba&s;ing Circum|&s;tances? NOW is a <HI>Special Sea&s;on;</HI> for the SPIRIT of the Holy One, to come in upon His Faithful Servants, with more than ordi|nary Con&s;olations. Now, <HI>Rejoyce &amp; be Exceeding Glad,</HI> &s;ayes our Saviour. This has been in all Ages, the Experience of the Faithful; 2 Cor. I. 5. <HI>As the Sufferings of Chri&s;t abound in us, &s;o our Con&s;olation al&s;o aboundeth by Chri&s;t.</HI> Hence, <HI>The Con&s;olations of the Martyrs,</HI> the&s;e are become a <HI>Proverb in I&s;rael!</HI></P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible to a&s;cend any Higher, in the Con&s;olations of GOD? Yes; From an <HI>Earne&s;t</HI> and <HI>Foreta&s;te</HI> of Heaven, we may a&s;cend in|to <HI>Heaven</HI> it &s;elf. Wherefore,</P>
<P>Fourthly, and La&s;tly; There are <HI>Con&s;olations of</HI> GOD, mo&s;t Ble&s;&s;ed Con&s;olations, re&s;erved for us in the Heavenly BLESSED|NESS. HEAVEN, tis Con&s;olation in the Con&s;ummation of it. The Departed <HI>Spirit</HI> of a Good Man, is tran&s;ported into the <HI>Para|di&s;e</HI> of GOD. When he is in that Paradi&s;e, we read; Luk. 16.25. <HI>He is Comforted.</HI> Ere long the Dead <HI>Children of God,</HI> arrive to a <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> from the Dead. The <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> was, in the ancient Language of the Orient, called, <HI>The Con&s;olation.</HI> In the Re&s;urrecti|on

<P>There are provided &s;uch Con&s;olations to Encourage us in the Service of God.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> The Con&s;olations of the Great GOD, Really are <HI>no Small Con&s;olations.</HI> No; as we read; P&s;al.

<P>Fir&s;t. The <HI>Con&s;olations of</HI> GOD are GREAT for the NUMBER of them. Truly, in the Con&s;olations of God, we have a <HI>Remedy</HI> for every <HI>Malady.</HI> We read, P&s;al.

Con&s;olations of God agreeable to all our Conditions; Con&s;olations in Temporals, and Con&s;olations in Spirituals; Con&s;olations from the Dew of Heaven, and Con&s;olations from the Fat of the Earth. I mu&s;t &s;ay, as the Apo&s;tle in another ca&s;e, <HI>The Time would fail me to mention them.</HI> I call to mind, how <HI>Jerom</HI> of old E&s;&s;ay'd the Sum of them; <HI>Paupertatem times; &s;ed Bonos Pauperes Chri&s;tus appellat.

XXI. 7. <HI>He that over-cometh, &s;hall Inherit all things.</HI></P>
<P>I will now deal with my Hearers, as <HI>Abraham</HI> was dealt withal; Gen. XV. 5. <HI>And He brought him forth abroad, and &s;aid, Look now toward Heaven, and tell the Stars, if thou be Able to Number them. And He &s;aid, &s;o &s;hall thy Seed be.</HI> [I will not &s;tand now to Enquire, how far this Pa&s;&s;age might contribute unto the ancient and famous Tradition which the Pagans had, of our Patriarchs being an <HI>A&s;tro|nomer;</HI> but,] I will &s;ay, even &s;o; O Child of God; can&s;t thou <HI>tell the Number of the Stars?</HI> The <HI>Stars</HI> vi&s;ible to the una&s;&s;i&s;ted Eye in|deed, we may tell the <HI>Number</HI> of them; No man ever yet &s;aw with|out Gla&s;&s;es Two Thou&s;and of them; The late&s;t &amp; large&s;t Globes have but Nineteen Hundred.

of them. <HI>Con&s;olations,</HI> the <HI>Quality</HI> whereof is Excellent, &amp; Exqui|&s;ite; the Excellency Invaluable, Incomprehen&s;ible. We have a Notable Term for them; Heb. VI. 18. <HI>Strong Con&s;olations.</HI> The Con&s;olations of the Faithful, they have &s;ometimes been &s;uch, that they have been too <HI>Strong</HI> for them; they have not been able to bear them; they have been forced to cry out; <HI>Lord, &s;tay thy Hand; thy frail Servant can bear no more.</HI> Yea, the Con&s;olations of the Faithful, what are they le&s;s than <HI>Infinite?</HI> It is the Infinite GOD Him&s;elf, in whom they have their Con&s;olations. They are <HI>Con&s;o|lations of GOD,</HI> and they are Con&s;olations IN God. The Infinite GOD, &s;aid unto the Father of the Faithful; Gen.

XLIII. 4. <HI>I will go unto</HI> GOD, <HI>my Exceeding Joy.</HI> The Con&s;olations of the Faithful, are of no lower a &s;train than this; <Q>The Great GOD is my God, and He will &s;urely do me Good: He will never leave me nor for&s;ake me. The Power of God will ever &s;upply my wants; the Wi&s;dom of God will ever Direct my ways; the Good|ne&s;s of God will open the Trea&s;ures of Mercy for me.

<P>I now wonder no longer, at the words of that Renowned (and then Retired) States-man, Count <HI>Oxi&s;tern,</HI> to the Excellent Lord <HI>Whitlock. I do a&s;&s;ure you I have found more comfort in my Retreat, than in all my Greatne&s;s.

<P N="3"><HI>III</HI> Every one will now grant me a Third A&s;&s;ertion. <HI>The Great Con&s;olations of</HI> GOD, if they are SMALL with us, <HI>Great</HI> is our Ig|norance, <HI>Great</HI> is our Corruption; we are <HI>Greatly to be blamed for it.</HI> It cannot but be a <HI>Great</HI> Error, a <HI>Great</HI> Evil, in men, to &s;et but a <HI>Lit|tle E&s;teem,</HI> on the <HI>Great Con&s;olations</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>This is now &s;o plain, it calls for no further Demon&s;tration.

And, The <HI>Con&s;olations of God are Small</HI> with a man, when a man, who has a <HI>Title</HI> to them, is not Contented with it, or thinks it not Enough to yield Contentment unto him.</P>
<P>I am now fairly arrived unto the <HI>Expo&s;tulation,</HI> in which the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions are to terminate.</P>
<P>But how many, how many, are to be now addre&s;s'd with a mo&s;t Pungent <HI>Expo&s;tulation!</HI> Certainly, There are very many among us, of whom it may be fear'd, <HI>The Con&s;olations of God are Small unto

Ah, <HI>Chri&s;tle&s;s</HI> Unbeliever! The Con&s;olations of God are Small with thee. If there be any Con&s;olations, they are &s;uch as an Intere&s;t in a Glorious CHRIST is accompanied withal.

Such Con&s;olations of God, are they &s;o <HI>Small</HI> with thee, that the filthy and ful&s;ome Grati|fications of the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> are to be preferred before them! Has the <HI>Devil</HI> more De&s;ireable Things for thee, than the&s;e <HI>Con&s;olations of God?</HI> This, This indeed is the cur&s;ed Language of thy continu|ance in thy Sins.

<P>Thirdly. Sinner, <HI>De&s;pairing</HI> of Mercy &amp; Pardon, Thy DESPAIR does declare, That the <HI>Con&s;olations of God</HI> are too SMALL with thee, to conquer it. There are Sinners who <HI>See</HI> them&s;elves, and perhaps have cau&s;e to <HI>own</HI> them&s;elves, <HI>The chief of Sinners.</HI> The &s;ight of their Sins exceedingly Terrifies them.

To them that have been the Greate&s;t Mon&s;ters of Sin, there is now Proclamed this <HI>Con&s;olation of God!</HI> What an Heart-melting word is that? Mic. VII. 19. <HI>He will Subdue our Iniquities.</HI> Man, There &s;tands a mighty <HI>Army</HI> of <HI>Iniquities</HI> in the way of thy Happine&s;s. How mu&s;t thy Heart fail thee, when the Holy God <HI>Sets them in Or|der</HI> before thine Eyes! But now, Be &s;orry for thy <HI>Iniquities;</HI> with Remor&s;e lay down the Arms of thy Rebellion; lay Hold on the Tenders, and Merits of thy Saviour: Then the Pardoning Mercy of God, will <HI>Subdue</HI> this mighty <HI>Army</HI> of <HI>Iniquities.</HI> None of them &s;hall hinder His Favour to thee; They &s;hall be <HI>Ca&s;t into the depths of the Sea;</HI> the Red-Sea of thy Saviours Blood &s;hall drown this <HI>Ar|my.</HI> The <HI>Number</HI> or the <HI>Blackne&s;s</HI> of thy Sins mu&s;t not be thy Di&s;couragement. There is a <HI>Fountain Set Open</HI> for the mo&s;t <HI>Unclean Sinner</HI> among us all to repair unto! And upon thy <HI>Wa&s;hing</HI> in that <HI>Fountain,</HI> O Sinner, All thy Sin will be, as if it had never been at all. Thy pa&s;t <HI>Scarlet</HI> and <HI>Crim&s;on</HI> Abominations will not hinder a bright Complexion of <HI>Snow</HI> and <HI>Wooll</HI> from Succeeding in thy Pu|rified Soul. Is any of you di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with an Apprehen&s;ion of ha|ving <HI>Sinned Unpardonably;</HI> of having fallen into the <HI>Unpardonable Sin?</HI> To that Soul, I mu&s;t bring this <HI>Con&s;olation of God;</HI> Soul, Thy Di&s;tre&s;&s;ing <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>that,</HI> is a Proof that there is no <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> to <HI>Fear</HI> it. I will add; Art thou De&s;irous of a <HI>Pardon?</HI> Would a <HI>Pardon</HI> be to thee a <HI>Pearl of Great Price?</HI> Ha&s;t thou any value for the <HI>Blood</HI> of thy Saviour, which is the <HI>Price</HI> of thy <HI>Pardon?</HI> Tis very certain, Thou ha&s;t never yet fallen into the <HI>Sin that cannot be Pardoned.</HI> Oh! Let this Con&s;olation of God mightily Quicken you, to <HI>Repent,</HI> and <HI>Believe,</HI> and make &s;ure of the <HI>Attainable Pardon!</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. And, I Pray, What are the <HI>Con&s;olations of God;</HI> How SMALL! unto them who are unconcerned about Preparing for,
<PB N="16" REF="001467_0019_0FB34AD9241EC3E0">
and Approaching to, the SPECIAL ORDINANCES, where tho&s;e <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> are to be met withal? Concerning the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the Go&s;pel, we read, I&s;a. XII. 3. <HI>With Joy &s;hall ye Draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation.</HI> Of one who had been <HI>Bapti&s;ed,</HI> we read, <HI>He went on his way Rejoycing.</HI> By Reflecting on, and Improving of our <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> we may come to the <HI>Still Waters,</HI> where we &s;hall find <HI>Rivers of Con&s;olation.</HI> Alas, what a Rarity is this in the <HI>Chri&s;tian World!</HI> How do we <HI>Forget</HI> our <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Remember it as waters that pa&s;s away!</HI> We read again, that there was <HI>Great Joy in Jeru&s;a|lem</HI> of old, at the celebration of the <HI>Pa&s;sover.</HI> Oh! the <HI>Great Joy,</HI> of the Con&s;olation, which we might find in celebrating the <HI>Go&s;pel-Pa&s;sover</HI> at the Table of the Lord! Yet, alas, how do the <HI>Ways of Zion Mourn,</HI> becau&s;e there is no more careful walking in them! In the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of our Saviour, we may look for the <HI>Con&s;olations of God.</HI> They are the <HI>Statutes of the Lord,</HI> which <HI>Rejoyce the Heart.</HI> I &s;hall be &s;orry, if none of my Hearers are able to te&s;tify &s;o much, from what they have this very Day met withal. But more e&s;peci|ally, in <HI>Special Ordinances.</HI> What le&s;s to be look'd for, in the <HI>Hou&s;e of God,</HI> at the <HI>Gate of Heaven!</HI></P>
<P>Oh! why no more Sollicitous to come with Ready Souls, unto the mo&s;t <HI>Comfortable Ordinances</HI> of the Lord! Ah, Slothful Soul! Tis a Sad thing, that the Con&s;olations of God are &s;o <HI>Small</HI> with thee! What &s;ome have done thro' <HI>Petti&s;hne&s;s,</HI> may be &s;aid to be done by tho&s;e thro' <HI>Slothfulne&s;s;</HI> P&s;al. LXXVII. 2. <HI>My Soul refu&s;ed to be comforted.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly. Methinks, The <HI>Con&s;olations of God</HI> are too SMALL unto the People of God them&s;elves, when under their AFFLICTI|ONS, they take not up with tho&s;e <HI>Con&s;olations,</HI> but their <HI>Souls Re|fu&s;e to be Comforted.</HI> There are &s;ome, who have a part in the Con|&s;olations of God; And yet, when they are <HI>Afflicted,</HI> when in their <HI>Afflictions</HI> they are bereaved of &s;ome <HI>Earthly Con&s;olations,</HI> they are like her, of whom we read, Mat. II. 18. <HI>She would not be Comforted. Length of Time,</HI> alas, is the <HI>only Solace</HI> known by many Afflicted People, who would yet be E&s;teemed the People of God. When they are Afflicted, nothing will compo&s;e them; They will continue
<PB N="17" REF="001467_0020_0FB34ADAA1908F50">
to <HI>Rage,</HI> or to <HI>Pine,</HI> until &mdash; <HI>Longa Dies &s;edavit Vulnera mentis.</HI> But, O <HI>Di&s;con&s;olate</HI> People of God, Hearken a little to me. What a va&s;t Bundle of <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> have you, in that One word! Rom. VIII. 28. <HI>We know, all things work together for Good, unto them that Love God.</HI> Oh! Let it not be <HI>Small</HI> with you! One thing more: You lo&s;e <HI>Earth,</HI> but you have <HI>Heaven</HI> left you. And is this a <HI>Small</HI> thing in your Eyes?</P>
<P>I will fir&s;t Speak a very awful Word. It is this; If the Con&s;o|lations of God are &s;o <HI>Small</HI> with you, that they will <HI>do nothing</HI> to Quiet you, When you meet with Lo&s;&s;es and Cro&s;&s;es in an Evil World, it may be que&s;tion'd, Whether you have a part in tho&s;e <HI>Con&s;olations.</HI> I will add this; You will anon find, That <HI>nothing el&s;e will do</HI> to Quiet you; you will find a Wretched <HI>Vanity</HI> &amp; <HI>Vexation,</HI> in all other Con&s;olations: The Con&s;olations of <HI>This World</HI> will fail your Expectations, and be <HI>Phy&s;icians of no value.</HI></P>
<P>It was a Sweet Pa&s;&s;age of the Poet;
<Q><L>Taedia quem mundi teneant, reperire Quietem</L>
<L>Si velit, in Solo Numine quaerat eam.</L></Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t Engli&s;h it.</P>
<Q><L>Soul, whom the Worlds Fatigues do make to groan,</L>
<L>Seek all thy Comfort in thy GOD alone.</L></Q>
<P>You &s;hall allow me to Propo&s;e one thing more, in Pur&s;uance of the De&s;ign I am going upon. It was an Excellent Propo&s;al made in the Church of God Eleven Hundred years ago; <HI>Facilius erit Con|&s;olatio, &s;i inter Flagella quae Patimur, quae fecimus ad memoriam De|licta revocamus.</HI> Let us in all our <HI>Afflictions,</HI> be Mindful of our <HI>Mi&s;carriages,</HI> be Mournful for our <HI>Iniquities;</HI> Humbly Adore the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of God in all our <HI>Afflictive Ca&s;es:</HI> We are by &s;uch <HI>Humilia|tions</HI> prepared for the <HI>Con&s;olations of God.</HI> Now we may go on.</P>
<P>I will now make the Experiment, what the <HI>Con&s;olations of God</HI> will Signify, in Two or three Ca&s;es, that are of a frequent Occur|rence among us. The Ancient has taught me, <HI>Dolentem non Pote&s;t Con&s;olari, qui non concordat Dolori.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t. There are Some who are grievou&s;ly annoyed, fearfully di&s;turbed, with the FIERY DARTS which the <HI>Wicked One</HI> Shoots
<PB N="18" REF="001467_0021_0FB34ADC2608C930">
into their Minds. They cry out of the <HI>Injections,</HI> wherewith Satan troubles them; and affrights them: Sugge&s;tions full of <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> full of <HI>Bla&s;phemy,</HI> full of <HI>Helli&s;h</HI> Malignity, are injected by Satan into their Souls. The vexation is in&s;upportable; it renders them even weary of their Lives. <HI>Hideous Thoughts</HI> are thrown into them, and &s;uch as make them afraid the dreadful Wrath of God mu&s;t overtake them Immediately, Irremediably. A very <HI>Pityable</HI> ca&s;e! But can there be any <HI>Con&s;olations of God</HI> for One &s;o horribly Tempted of the Devil? Yes; And very <HI>Great</HI> Ones. There is that Con&s;olation; 1 Cor. X. 13. <HI>There has no Temptation taken you, but &s;uch as is Common to Man;</HI> Yea, Common to Good Men. Tis rather a Good, than a Bad, Sign to be thus Buffeted by the Devil. O Soul <HI>Mourning becau&s;e of the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Enemy;</HI> If the Devil did not Look upon thee, as upon one who made Con&s;cience of <HI>Sin|ning</HI> in thy <HI>Thoughts,</HI> it is probable, he would not chu&s;e to per&s;ecute thee with &s;uch <HI>Sinful Thoughts.</HI> Take this Con&s;olation al&s;o; Go on to <HI>Bewayl</HI> the&s;e <HI>Thoughts,</HI> to <HI>Abhor</HI> the&s;e <HI>Thoughts,</HI> to <HI>Renounce</HI> the&s;e <HI>Thoughts,</HI> and God will never lay them to thy Charge; No, they &s;hall be charged upon thy <HI>Adver&s;ary,</HI> who <HI>Provokes thee &s;ore;</HI> tis he that is the <HI>Father</HI> of them. And, then take likewi&s;e this Con&s;olation. By an unwearied Contradiction of the&s;e <HI>Thoughts,</HI> or making the&s;e Thoughts an Incentive as often as they recur, to rai&s;e <HI>Thoughts</HI> that &s;hall be directly contradictory to them, and fill'd with devout Acknowledgments of God and His Chri&s;t; this will &s;oon weary out thy Adver&s;ary; Tis but <HI>Re&s;i&s;ting the Devil</HI> thus a little while, and <HI>he will flee</HI> from thee!</P>
<P>Secondly. Are there any STRAITS upon us? Perhaps, we are Straitned with <HI>Poor</HI> and <HI>Low</HI> Circum&s;tances; The Times grow hard; we are afraid we &s;hall be hardly or but meanly provided for.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, there are &s;ome <HI>Great Con&s;olations of God</HI> which I can Lead you to. There is that Con&s;olation; Jam. II 5. <HI>Hath not God cho&s;en the Poor of this World, Rich in Faith, and Heirs of the King|dom?</HI> There is that Con&s;olation; P&s;al. XXXVII. 3. <HI>Tru&s;t in the Lord, and do Good, and verily thou &s;halt be fed.</HI> My Friend, Ha&s;t thou not a CHRIST? In Him thou ha&s;t <HI>Un&s;earchable Riches.</HI> In

Him will thy God <HI>Supply all thy Wants from His Glorious Riches.</HI> And if HE be thine, He will help thee, to all that can be Needful for thee. Thou ha&s;t a <HI>Father</HI> and a <HI>Feeder,</HI> that <HI>Knows all that thou Neede&s;t.</HI> I mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>Have ye forgotten the Con&s;olation, that that Speaks to you, as unto Children?</HI></P>
<P>If any of you meet with <HI>Impoveri&s;hing Di&s;a&s;ters,</HI> what will you &s;ay to that Word? 2 Chron. XXV. 9 <HI>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.</HI> Truly, Sir, If God gives you more <HI>Grace,</HI> than you had before; If you are made more <HI>Prayerful,</HI> more <HI>Watchful,</HI> more <HI>Weaned</HI> from this World; Or, if God have given you the <HI>Grace</HI> to bear your Impoveri&s;hments with <HI>Re&s;ignation;</HI> He has <HI>given you much more</HI> than all that has been taken from you. Is there <HI>nothing</HI> in the&s;e <HI>Con&s;olations?</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly. Have we our De&s;irable RELATIVES taken from us? But in this ca&s;e al&s;o, we have at hand, the <HI>Great Con&s;olations of God.</HI></P>
<P>Are the <HI>Relatives</HI> at a <HI>Di&s;tance</HI> from us in other Countries? Be Comforted; <HI>God Knows</HI> where they are. His Kind <HI>Eye</HI> is upon them there; His Kind <HI>Hand</HI> can reach them. If they are in <HI>Cap|tivity,</HI> yet, Jer. XXXI. 16. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, Refrain thy Voice from Weeping, and thine Eyes from Tears; for thy Work &s;hall be Re|warded, and they &s;hall come again from the Land of the Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>Has DEATH taken away the <HI>Relatives?</HI> Be Comforted; <HI>God Lives.</HI> And if a CHRIST be yours, you have the <HI>Good Part that can't be taken away.</HI> Should not that <HI>Widow</HI> be Comforted, who can &s;ay, <HI>My Maker is my Husband?</HI> Or, that <HI>Widower;</HI> who can &s;ay, <HI>God has Meant all unto Good?</HI></P>
<P>But the PARENTS who have buried their <HI>Children,</HI> have they no <HI>Con&s;olations of God?</HI> We read of &s;uch a thing as that, at the <HI>Funerals</HI> of old; Jer. XVI. 7. <HI>The Cup of Con&s;olations.</HI> Tis there provided for the Funerals of <HI>Parents. Parents</HI> al&s;o have it provided for the Funerals of their <HI>Children. Parents,</HI> I have one of Gods providing for you. O <HI>Drink of the wine, which I have mingled for you,</HI> &s;aith the Lord.

<P>It may be, the Children had <HI>Comfortable Symptoms</HI> upon them, in their Sober, Mode&s;t, Vertuous Behaviour. To hope, that it is well with them, is an un&s;peakable <HI>Con&s;olation.</HI> Then, as it was &s;aid unto the Ruler, on the Death of his Daughter; <HI>She is not Dead, but Sleepeth.</HI> Even the Pagan could give it as a Direction; <HI>Be not Sorrowful for the Dead; &s;ince there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of dying; But &s;pend thy Sorrow, <GAP DESC="foreign">, upon &s;uch as Dy wretchedly, and wofully.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Luther,</HI> when his Daughter <HI>Magdalene</HI> was Expiring, he read unto her, from the XXVI.

<P>Diver&s;e of the old Poets ob&s;erved, That if <HI>Tears</HI> would <HI>fetch back the Dead, <GAP DESC="foreign">.

<P>It may be, they were <HI>Children</HI> who have left <HI>Children,</HI> and have Enlarged the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>

<P>I will be&s;tow a Little Illu&s;tration upon this Matter, and &s;o Conclude it.</P>

<P>And what I go on to Remark, is, That altho' the Sacred Ora|cles, every where Con&s;pire to advi&s;e us, of a Day at hand, in which the <HI>Creation</HI> &s;hall be Delivered from the <HI>Vanity</HI> which it is now <HI>Groaning</HI> under, and an <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> and <HI>Peaceable</HI> Kingdom of God, &s;hall take Place in the World, yet they are all but Com|mentaries upon that <HI>Protevangelium;</HI> we have in <HI>That,</HI> the <HI>Origi|nal Text,</HI> as I may call it, and a <HI>Sure Foundation</HI> for our Hopes, <HI>That the World will not always be &s;o bad as now it is. Mare&s;ius,</HI> having written a Di&s;putation full of Bitter Zeal again&s;t the <HI>Chilia&s;ts;</HI> the incomparable <HI>Comenius,</HI> when he was about Four&s;core years of Age, wrote a Treati&s;e on that occa&s;ion, with all the Learning, and Vigour and Style, which could have been Expected from a <HI>Literator,</HI> in the very Meridian of all his Glory. The <HI>Begin|ning</HI> of his Treati&s;e runs upon this Argument. The Birth of <HI>Chi|lia&s;m</HI> was in <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI> It was born to us in the <HI>Protevangelium</HI> given there. There we find foretold, a Perpetual <HI>War</HI> between the <HI>Serpent</HI> and our <HI>Saviour.</HI> There is foretold, the final <HI>I&s;&s;ue</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="001467_0027_0FB34AE526E12FA0">
of the War, in the De&s;truction of the <HI>Serpent,</HI> and an Illu&s;trious and Everla&s;ting Victory of our <HI>Saviour.</HI> Well; But where is the <HI>Field</HI> of the&s;e Tran&s;actions? This is Evidently the EARTH. All the World Knows and Feels, that this our <HI>Earth,</HI> is the <HI>Field</HI> of the <HI>War.</HI> We de&s;ire then to Know, Whether after all, the Conqueror mu&s;t <HI>Leave the Field</HI> unto his vanqui&s;hed Enemy? Whether the Conqueror do not always <HI>Cha&s;e the Enemy out of the Field,</HI> and he him&s;elf keep the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. <HI>Pelli Solet Ho&s;tis in ultima u&s;que antra Sua, Captivu&s;que in Carcerem mitti.</HI> So then, there is a Day at hand, when <HI>Satan,</HI> with all his Power and Party mu&s;t be Cha&s;ed off the Face of the <HI>Earth;</HI> and the Earth be Entirely in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Admirable Saviour. Let this be our Conclu&s;ion; This our <HI>Con&s;olation.</HI> &mdash; But, <HI>How Long, O Lord, Holy and True; How Long, How Long!</HI></P>
