<P>_THE Text gives us an account of the Day of Doom, which is the la&s;t Day of A&s;&s;ize where in every Man &s;hall be tried at the bar of God's ju&s;tice; and every Man &s;hall then and there receive according to his Works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.</P>
<P>I will not trouble my &s;elf or you with the &s;igns of this Day, becau&s;e I have not time, but will proceed.</P>

It is mo&s;t certain that the Day of Judgment will come, and that it will be very dreadful to all the Wicked. But &s;eeing the&s;e things mu&s;t be, what manner of per&s;ons ought we to be in all manner of conver&s;ation; always looking for the coming of Chri&s;t: At who&s;e coming the Sun &s;hall be darkned, the Moon &s;hall not give her Light, the Stars &s;hall be &s;haken, and the Elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat: Who can hear of all this and not be wonderfully di&s;mayed? O! who dares eat or drink or &s;leep, or take a mi|nutes re&s;t, be&s;ure the&s;e days &s;hall come. O wake ye Drunkards, and weep all ye drink|ers of Wine, becau&s;e of the new Wine, for it &s;hall be pulled from your Mouths: Gird your &s;elves, and lament ye Prie&s;ts, howl ye Mini&s;ters of the Altar, alas! for the day of the Lord is at hand.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE &s;hall be this,</P>
<P><HI>That 'tis a Go&s;pel-truth that Chri&s;t that came into the World in the form of a Servant, will one Day come as a Judge, attended with all his Angels.</HI></P>
<P>And if this be &s;o, then fir&s;t for a U&s;e of Exhertation.</P>
<P>USE. 1. Let us all be warned, and while we have time provide for that Day. Yet the Weather is fair, we may frame an Ark to &s;ave us from the Flood: yet are the An|gels at the gates of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and yet is <HI>Jonch</HI>

<P>I An&s;wer! He will appear only as a Man to Judge us, who as a Man appeared to be Judged; Con&s;ider this ye that are going to the Bar, what a &s;ight will this be to the Faithle&s;s Jews, Stubborn Gentiles; wicked Chri&s;tians, when every Eye &s;hall &s;ee him, and they al&s;o that receive him?

<P>U&s;e 2. As you mean the good of your Souls, amend your Lives; call your &s;elves to an Account while it is called to day, &s;earch and examine all your thoughts, words and deeds, and pro&s;trating your &s;elves before God with broken and bleeding Affections, pray that your Names may be written in the Book of Life: and if you do &s;o, God is not unrighteous to forget your labour of Love, &amp; all your good Works, for at this day the Book &s;hall be opened, our Works ma|nife&s;ted, and as we have done &s;o we mu&s;t be Rewarded, for then &s;hall he Reward e|very Man according to his Works.

<P>The Pri&s;oners are tried, the Verdict is brought in, the Indictments are found, &amp; the Judge now &s;its upon life &amp; death, even rea|dy with &s;parkling Eyes to pronounce his Sentence. The Lord grant that when this Day is come, that the Sentence may be for us, &amp; we be &s;aved to our endle&s;s Comfort and everla&s;ting Happine&s;s: who &s;hall be able to unfold this Reward; there lies in it a Doom and Execution, Oh now hold up your heads all the Saints of the mo&s;t high God, for this will be a ble&s;&s;ed Day to you, for you &s;hall hear the &s;weet Voice of Chri&s;t, &s;aying, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inhe|rit

<P>But I mu&s;t return to the left Hand, and &s;hew you another Crew prepared for ano|ther Sentence, and O what a terrible Sen|tence will that be, which will make all Ears glow and tingle.

<P>Fir&s;t, they mu&s;t depart. This &s;eems no|thing to the wicked now; they are Con|tented to be gone, they have much more

But whether mu&s;t they go, into everla&s;ting Fire? O what a Bed is this, no Feathers but Fire: no Friends but Furies, no ea&s;e but Fetters; no Light but Smoak, no Clocks to pa&s;s away the time, but timele&s;s Eter|nity; Fire intellerable, a Fire burning and never dying; what can endure everla&s;ting Flames, it &s;hall not be quenched night nor day, the &s;moak thereof &s;hall go up for e|vermore; the wicked &s;hall be crowded together like brick in a fiery Furnace. But for whom was this Prepared, for the De|vil and his Angels, the&s;e mu&s;t be your companions; the la&s;t &s;entence is now pro|nouncing, What, Go, Who? Ye Cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting Fire, to a crew of Devils: O take heed that you live in God's fear, le&s;t that leaving his &s;ervice, he give you this Reward; Depart ye Cur&s;ed.</P>
<P>U&s;e 1. Con&s;ider that fearful trembling will &s;eize on their Souls that have their
<PB N="17" REF="003131_0011_0FF007789B402A70">Sentence for eternal Flames! O which way will they turn, or how will they e&s;cape Almighty's wrath? To go backwards is impo&s;&s;ible, to go forwards, 'tis intollerable, who&s;e help will they crave? God is their Judge, Heaven their Foe, the Saints de|ride them, Angels hate them; Good Lord, what a world of mi&s;eries hath &s;eiz'd on the&s;e mi&s;erable Souls; Their Executioners are Devils, the Dungeon Hell, the Earth &s;tands open, and the cruel Furnace ready boiling to Receive them; Oh! how will the&s;e poor Souls quake and tremble? eve|ry part of his body will bear a part in this Puni&s;hment; Eyes weep, Hands wring, Brea&s;t beat, Heart ake, Voices cry now, O Man of Earth, What will all thy wealth avail thee? what can all thy Plea&s;ures profit thee? One drop of water to cool thy tongue in the&s;e flames is worth more than all the Plea&s;ures in the World, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16.24.</P>
<P>Thus you have heard the Sentence of the Ju&s;t and Wicked; and now is the Judge ari&s;ing from his glorious Seat; the Saints guard him along, and the Sentenced Pri&s;oners are delivered to the Jaylors; What a &s;creech of horror will be heard. What Woes and Lamentations will be ut|tered, when Devils and Reprobates and all the damned crew of Hell &s;hall be dri|ven
<PB N="18" REF="003131_0012_0FF0077B06208AE0">into Hell, never to return again; down they go howling and &s;creeching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> gna&s;hing their Teeth; as the World leaves them, the Earth for&s;akes them, Hell en|tertains them, there they mu&s;t live and die, and yet not live nor die, but dying live, and living die.

In a word, that wailing, weeping, roaring, yelling, filling Heaven and Earth and Hell; O mi&s;erable wretches. <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.23. <HI>Take them away ca&s;t them into utter Darkne&s;s, where &s;hall be weep|ing and gna&s;hing of Teeth;</HI> A darkne&s;s in|deed; they mu&s;t be ever debarred from the &s;ight of Heaven, no Sun-&s;hine ever peeps within the&s;e walls, nothing is there but thick &s;moak and darkne&s;s, and &s;uch is the portion of Sinners and reward of the Wicked.</P>
<P>To wind up all in one word of Com|fort to the Saints of God, look upwards, and you may &s;ee your ble&s;&s;ed Company.</P>
