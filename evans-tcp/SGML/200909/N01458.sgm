<P>Wherefore he &s;aith, When he a&s;cended up on high, he led Captivity Captive, and gave Gifts unto Men.&mdash;</P>
<P>And he gave &s;ome Apo&s;tles: and &s;ome Prophets: and &s;ome Evangeli&s;ts: and &s;ome Pa&s;tors and Teachers.</P></Q>

<P>THE <HI>Text</HI> &s;peaks of the <HI>A&s;cention</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST into Heaven, where He is &s;et down at the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on high; the Glory of which A&s;|cent is here meditated in the ble&s;&s;ed Fruits and Effects of it to the &s;inful Children of Men.</P>
<P>Three things here offer to our Con&s;ide|ration.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="001732_0004_0FB77912DDE35630">
1. <HI>A Prophecy</HI> of our Saviour's A&s;cen&s;ion is referr'd to; and a very Illu&s;trious one it is, in the 68. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 18. <HI>Thou ha&s;t a&s;cended on high, thou ha&s;t led Captivity captive; thou ha&s;t received Gifts for Men, yea for the Rebellious al&s;o, that the Lord God might dwell among them.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> in the Text quotes the&s;e words of <HI>David,</HI> who &s;aw the day of our Lord's A&s;cen&s;ion, and &s;pake of it in Spirit as a thing <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> it was &s;o &s;ure and certain to be in God's appointed time.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN the Text the <HI>Accompli&s;hment</HI> of this Prophecy is &s;uppo&s;ed and taken for granted, which amounts to an <HI>A&s;&s;ertion</HI> of its. Fulfil|ment, in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t. To Him the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> here applies it, as one of the In|&s;tances wherein the Spirit of Chri&s;t in the Prophets did te&s;tify before the Glory that &s;hould follow his Sufferings.</P>
<P>THE <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> had &s;poken of Chri&s;t <HI>Pro|phetically</HI> in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Per&s;on. <HI>Thou</HI> ha&s;t a&s;|cended, <HI>&amp;c</HI>&mdash;. The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> applies it to him <HI>Hi&s;torically</HI> in the <HI>third</HI> Per&s;on; when <HI>He</HI> a&s;cended up on high, <HI>He</HI> led <HI>&amp;c</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<P>AND to &s;atisfy us that the Prophecy of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> was of Chri&s;t truly, and can bear no other Application ultimatly, the Apo&s;tle argues in a <HI>Parenthe&s;is</HI> between the
<PB N="5" REF="001732_0005_0FB779184D3E6180">two Ver&s;es of my <HI>Text;</HI> which I have pre|&s;um'd to omit in the reading them ju&s;t now to you; <HI>Now that he a&s;cended, what is it but that he al&s;o de&s;cended fir&s;t into the lower parts of the earth? He that de&s;cended is the &s;ame that a&s;cended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things.</HI> Which is as much as to &s;ay, that <HI>David</HI> in Spirit &s;pake of <HI>Him</HI> who fir&s;t came down from Heaven to our Earth, and here in our fle&s;h de&s;cended into the Grave, from whence he ro&s;e and a&s;cended bodily far a|bove all vi&s;ible Heavens; unto the pre&s;ence and Throne of God. Thus we &s;ee the <HI>Pro|phecy</HI> and its <HI>Accompli&s;hment;</HI> that <HI>David</HI>'s words did indeed mean Chri&s;t's A&s;cention, and were fulfilled in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. LET us ob&s;erve the <HI>glorious things which are &s;poken</HI> concerning the A&s;cention of Chri&s;t:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That <HI>he led Captivity Captive.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That <HI>he received and gave Gifts to men.</HI> And</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The&s;e <HI>Gifts are &s;pecify'd, He gave &s;ome A|po&s;tles, and &s;ome Prophets, and &s;ome Evange|li&s;ts,</HI> &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THERE is doubtle&s;s and <HI>Allu&s;ion</HI> in the words unto the U&s;ages and Cu&s;tom of <HI>Generals</HI> and <HI>Conquerors,</HI> who after great and illu&s;tri|ous <HI>Victories</HI> obtained by them were wont to <HI>Triumph;</HI> and in their triumphant <HI>Entries</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001732_0006_0FB77925B7E96A60">into the Capital City of the Empire to which they belong'd and for which they fought, they us'd to be follow'd by the <HI>Captives</HI> whom they had taken in the War; and to make &s;hew of the Riches, the <HI>Spoils</HI> they had taken from the Enemy, and to add unto the pomp of the day they made public "<HI>Largitives</HI> and <HI>Donatives</HI> to their Souldiers, and &s;catter'd their Magnificence and Boun|ty among the Crouds.</P>
<P>IT may &s;eem probable that the&s;e &s;ort of <HI>Triumphs</HI> were in u&s;e in <HI>David</HI>'s time, and the mo&s;t <HI>famous One</HI> of his Reign might be on that occa&s;ion whereon the 68. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> was compo&s;ed, namely the <HI>Tran&s;lation of the Ark</HI> (the Type of Chri&s;t's Mediation) into the Tent which he had pitched for it in <HI>Sion.</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI> Triumphs were of a later Date, but an&s;wer'd &s;o exactly to the De&s;cription here given by <HI>David,</HI> of the leading the Captives in proce&s;&s;ion, and the &s;cattering Gifts among the Multitude that we may think the <HI>Nations</HI> received the Cu&s;tom from <HI>him;</HI> who&s;e Victories in war well de&s;erv'd a Triumph; and were &s;ingled out by God to be the <HI>Types</HI> of the Spiritual Victory of Chri&s;t over the powers of Darkne&s;s. This &s;eems to me more worthy to be &s;aid, than
<PB N="7" REF="001732_0007_0FB77927364B8D28">that the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> manife&s;tly alludes unto the <HI>Roman Conquerors:</HI> which tho' it might have pa&s;s'd had our Text been fir&s;t deliver|ed by the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> who liv'd under the <HI>Roman Empire;</HI> yet what Allu&s;ion to <HI>their</HI> Triumphs cou'd <HI>David</HI> make who liv'd &s;o long before them, unle&s;s you will allow too that he <HI>pro|phe&s;ied</HI> of them.</P>
<P><HI>DAVID</HI> was a famous <HI>Type of Chri&s;t,</HI> and that <HI>Great Solemnity of his Reign,</HI> the carrying of the <HI>Ark</HI> in pomp to <HI>Sion,</HI> was an illu&s;tri|ous Type of our Lord's <HI>A&s;cention</HI> into Hea|ven <HI>David</HI> on that triumphant Occa&s;ion celebrated <HI>all the Victories</HI> that God had gi|ven him over His and his Church's Ene|mies, and a&s;cribed all the Glory of them to God and to the <HI>Ark of his &s;trength. This</HI> was now <HI>a&s;cending on High,</HI> even the <HI>Ark,</HI> from a humble and ob&s;cure &s;tate wherein it had long been, into a <HI>Royal Tent</HI> which he had pitch'd for it in that Hill of Sion which God had cho&s;en, the Mount which he lov'd. Now to grace that Proce&s;&s;ion and A&s;cent of the Ark, we may &s;uppo&s;e that the King bro't forth the train of <HI>Captives,</HI> even <HI>&s;uch</HI> as before had often led many an <HI>I&s;raelite</HI> into <HI>Captivity.</HI> Thus Captivity was led Captive, and the <HI>Spoils</HI> taken from them
<PB N="8" REF="001732_0008_0FB779288FC552B0">were carry'd to <HI>Sion,</HI> and there <HI>Dedicated</HI> to God, for the building of the <HI>Temple</HI> in after days, where the <HI>Lord God</HI> might dwell a|mong them. Of <HI>Him</HI> David had <HI>receiv'd</HI> the&s;e Victories and the&s;e Spoils; and to Him he <HI>a&s;cribes</HI> the glory of the one, and to His &s;er|vice and &s;picial honour he <HI>Con&s;ecrates</HI> the o|ther. Of which Spoils that <HI>David</HI> gathered and Dedicated, which were of Silver and Gold and Bra&s;s, <HI>Solomon</HI> afterwards adorn'd the Temple, and made its holy Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>THESE things, tho' the <HI>Glories</HI> of the Kingdoms of this world were but a <HI>low fi|gure</HI> and &s;hadow of the A&s;cention of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> the Son and Lord of <HI>David.</HI> When He a&s;cended <HI>on high,</HI> even to the <HI>right Hand of God,</HI> above all Heavens, He did as Con|querors us'd to do and <HI>more; He led Capti|vity Captive;</HI> He led tho&s;e Captive that had led us &s;o, and if He had not interpos'd would have led us &s;o for ever; He made o|penly a &s;hew of Principalities and Powers, of Satan, Sin and Death &s;poiled of their power over His Subjects; utterly broken for ever and led in Chains: He appear'd then <HI>more than a Conqueror,</HI> for every Conqueror was not allow'd a <HI>Triumph,</HI> and all <HI>Believers</HI> too who follow.

<PB N="9" REF="001732_0009_0FB7792A53FB4F88">are more than Conquerors thro' Him, they too are <HI>Triumphers;</HI> for thanks be to God who cau&s;eth us always <HI>to Triumph in Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THOU ha&s;t received Gifts for men, yea for the Rebellious;</HI> &s;ays the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t; He gave Gifts unto men;</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Apo&s;tle.</HI> He received and and He gave; He gave that which He had received; for it was given Him to be&s;tow: <HI>Joh.</HI> 17.2, 22. <HI>As thou ha&s;t given him,&mdash; that he &s;hou'd give&mdash;: and the glory which thou gave&s;t me I have given them.</HI></P>
<P>GIFTS for <HI>Men,</HI> not for <HI>Angels: Henry.</HI> For <HI>Men</HI> in General, not for the <HI>Jews</HI> only, but for the <HI>Gentiles</HI> al&s;o. Gifts <HI>in Man,</HI> as the <HI>Margin</HI> reads it in the <HI>P&s;alms; i. e.</HI> in the <HI>humane Nature,</HI> which the Son of God was pleas'd to cloath Him&s;elf in, in whom (as Mediator) <HI>all fulne&s;s dwells,</HI> that from His fulne&s;s we all might receive.</P>
<P><HI>YEA for the Rebellious:</HI> for tho&s;e that had been Rebels, and now were in Rebel|lion; had forfeited any claim to the lea&s;t Favour, but had de&s;erv'd and incurr'd wrath to the uttermo&s;t; for Rebels of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> in particular who had been <HI>Enemies in their minds by wicked works;</HI> even the&s;e has He reconciled. So they &s;ay, the <HI>Generous Con|querors</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="001732_0010_0FB7792FA2B8E698">of old in the day of their Triumph, were wont not only to reward their <HI>Friends and faithful Souldiers</HI> with munificent Gifts, but to &s;how <HI>Acts of Grace al&s;o to their very Captives.</HI> The a&s;cending <HI>Saviour</HI> gave His Divine Gifts even for and to His <HI>Crucifiers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THAT the Lord God might dwell among them;</HI> &s;ays the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t.</HI> That He might <HI>&s;et up a Church</HI> in a rebellious world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry.</NOTE> in which He would dwell by His Word and Ordinances, as of old in the Sanctuary. So &s;ays the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> in the ver&s;es after our Text; the&s;e Gifts from the A&s;cended Saviour were given <HI>for the per|fecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mini|&s;try, for the Edifying the body of Chri&s;t; till we all come in the unity of the faith,</HI> &amp;c&mdash;. That is in one word, for the building up a Church, and for the Edification of Souls in Know|ledge Faith and Holine&s;s unto Salvation.</P>
<P>AND now we come more particularly to con&s;ider what the&s;e Gifts of the A&s;cend|ed Saviour to His Church were, and tho&s;e the <HI>Apo&s;tle &s;pecifies and enumerates:</HI> He gave &s;ome Apo&s;tles, &s;ome Prophets, <HI>&amp;c</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<P>YOU ob&s;erve that only <HI>Offices</HI> are named, but <HI>Qualifications</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed; Chri&s;t never gave Offices without a &s;uitable
<PB N="11" REF="001732_0011_0FB77939491E51F0">mea&s;ure of Gifts for the di&s;charge of them; which are here therefore repre&s;ented in their <HI>variety</HI> and <HI>diver&s;ity;</HI> &s;ome <HI>Ordinary,</HI> others <HI>Extraordinary.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Extraordinary Offices</HI> and divine Gifts agreeable to them: <HI>&s;ome Apo&s;tles, &s;ome Pro|phets, &s;ome Evangeli&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> had an Immediate Call to their Office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pool.</NOTE> a Univer&s;al Com|mi&s;&s;ion, Infallibility in teaching, and the power of working Miracles; they were Prophets and more than Prophets, being commi&s;&s;ioned and gifted in an excellent manner for the fir&s;t founding of the Chri|&s;tian Church in all parts of the World.</P>
<P>NEXTLY <HI>Prophets:</HI> The&s;e al&s;o were Extraordinary Officers, whom God endow|ed to foretel things to come, and expound the writings of the old Prophets; they In|terpreted Scripture by Immediate Revela|tion.</P>
<P>Thirdly <HI>Evangeli&s;ts.</HI> The&s;e likewi&s;e were Extraordinary Officers, ordained by the A|po&s;tles as their Companions and A&s;&s;i&s;tants in preaching the word and planting Churches in the places where they had travelled.

<P><PB N="12" REF="001732_0012_0FB77942392F2900">

<P>I will only add, to carry on the <HI>Harmony</HI> between the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> be|tween the <HI>Prophecy</HI> and its <HI>Fulfilment;</HI> That this <HI>variety</HI> of Offices and Gifts; Superior and Inferior,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mollierus.</NOTE> Ordinary and Extraodinary, the one ex|celling &s;o much the other in Glory, for the building of the Spiritual Temple of Chri&s;t; do well an&s;wer unto the <HI>Princely Gifts</HI> which <HI>David</HI> dedicated for the building of <HI>Solomon's Temple,</HI> and the <HI>Ark</HI>'s.

<P N="1">I. <HI>OUR Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has In&s;tituted and Ordained a Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, to continue in His Church, and for the Edification of it unto the End of the World.</HI></P>
<P>THE Saviour of Men has had, hath, and ever will have a Church in the World. This has exi&s;ted the &s;ame, under the various Me|thods and Di&s;pen&s;ations of Religion and of the Covenant of Grace, which have been from <HI>Adam</HI> to this day, and &s;o will it be by the power and grace of God unto the End of Time. In this Church of the Living God there ever has been <HI>the Mini&s;try of Men,</HI> and of &s;ome particular per&s;ons whom God has called, endowed, and in diver&s;e manner authorized to Mini&s;ter in holy things unto others, for their Souls Good. Of the <HI>Patri|archal Age</HI> we can &s;ay but little more than this, that the venerable <HI>Fathers</HI> of the &s;eve|ral Religious Families and Tribes have been e&s;teemed both <HI>Princes and Prie&s;ts</HI> to them; no doubt <HI>praying</HI> with and <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> their hou|&s;holds, <HI>in&s;tructing</HI> and <HI>charging</HI> them accor|ding to the will of God, receiving their Offerings and <HI>offering</HI> up Sacrifices, and <HI>lead|ing</HI> in the Spiritual Sacrifices of prai&s;e unto
<PB N="15" REF="001732_0015_0FB7795001FB9568">God. No doubt too, but there were Extra|ordinary <HI>Prophets</HI> rai&s;ed up and in&s;pired and &s;ent by God with His will in their mouths upon Occa&s;ion; as well as more Ordinary Revelations of Heaven to the <HI>Holy Men</HI> that walked with God, as <HI>Enoch, Noah</HI> and <HI>Abra|ham</HI> did.</P>
<P><HI>ENOCH</HI> prophecy'd in his day of the <HI>Judgment</HI> yet to come, the &s;econd Coming of our Lord; as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Jude</HI> informs us. <HI>Noah</HI> was a <HI>Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in his Generation, and the Long&s;uffering of God endured them for a great while under the Endeavours of his holy Mini&s;try. <HI>Abraham</HI> we know was a faithful Father to his nu|merous Hou&s;hold, to in&s;truct them in and command them after him <HI>to keep the way of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus things continued untill the De&s;cent of the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael into <HI>Egypt;</HI> where neither were their Po&s;terity left al|together we may think without In&s;truction; but when God vi&s;ited them by the Mi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and had bro't them thence by an out&s;tretched Arm, He then came down on <HI>Sinai,</HI> and gave them the Law by the di&s;po&s;ition of Angels, in thunders and light|nings; which threw them into &s;uch terrors

BUT there is yet a farther pa&s;&s;age of our Saviours, wherein he told his Di&s;ciples that his own Departure was <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> unto the Coming of the Comforter, and that the Coming of the Spirit was ab&s;olutely <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to the carrying on his Intere&s;t on Earth; for that he was to receive of him and to &s;hew it unto them. <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.7, 14. <HI>Never|thele&s;s, I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not a way, the Com|forter will not come unto you; but if I depart I will &s;end him unto you.

<P>THUS the Spirit of Grace was to come <HI>from the glorify'd Redeemer,</HI> to glorify him on Earth, by converting the world to him, by the Mini&s;try of Men.

<P>AND now let us &s;ee the <HI>Event,</HI> the Illu|&s;trious Event, wherein this glorious Promi&s;e was <HI>fulfilled;</HI> which was upon this famous day of <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> ten days after our Lord's A&s;cention: when the Di&s;ciples being met

But <HI>Peter</HI> &s;tood up, in|&s;pired and filled with the De&s;cended Spirit of Truth and Grace, and explain'd the a|mazing Occurrence to them: He told them in &s;hort, <HI>That God had rai&s;ed up the Crucified Je&s;us from the Dead, and had exalted him to his own right hand in the highe&s;t Heavens;</HI> for they had often &s;een and convers'd with Him after his Re&s;urrection, and at la&s;t they &s;aw

<P>THUS the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t was given when Je|&s;us was glorified,</HI> i. e. after his A&s;cention, and not till then; <HI>i. e.</HI> in the fulle&s;t Effu&s;ion of his Heavenly Gifts and Graces.

<P N="4">4. <HI>OUR Doctrine would put per&s;ons on dedi|cating them&s;elves to the Holy Work of the Mini|&s;try, and Parents on devoting their goodlie&s;t Sons thereunto:</HI> Give <HI>them,</HI> O give <HI>your &s;elves,</HI> un|to the &s;ervice of your A&s;cended Lord, that he may make you worthy Gifts unto his Church.

<P N="5">5. <HI>THE Doctrine would direct people in chu|&s;ing a Mini&s;ter or Pa&s;tor, to be over them in the Lord:</HI> which as it is their undoubted <HI>right,</HI> &s;o they are <HI>accountable</HI> to Chri&s;t <HI>how</HI> they improve it for the good of their own Souls and their Families.

<P>TOO many there are that are ready to <HI>intrude without either Gifts or Graces</HI> into the &s;acred Work of the Mini&s;try; and too many

<P N="6">6. <HI>OUR Doctrine would comfort and encou|rage tho&s;e that are in the Mini&s;try, and de&s;ire to be found Faithful in the wighty Tru&s;t:</HI> You have (my Reverend <HI>Brethren and Fathers</HI>) the glorious LORD and SAVIOUR in the Heavens to be looking to and relying on, to &s;upply you with Gifts and Graces, to &s;upport and comfort you in all your Diffi|culties, to protect and defend you in his Service, and to &s;ucceed you in his Work.
