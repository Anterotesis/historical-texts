<OPENER><SALUTE>Beloved Brethren, &amp; Neighbours,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE, and have rea&s;on to believe, there have been many among you, of every Age, <HI>Fearing</HI> and <HI>Trembling</HI> before GOD, and <HI>Preparing</HI> to meet Him in the way of His <HI>Judgments;</HI> and therefore you have been &s;uch a number of you, &s;o de&s;irous of having the following <HI>Sermon</HI> put into your hands, which if it may any ways contribute to the exciting a holy fear of GOD, and his Terrible Judgments in any, <HI>my Heart &s;hall rejoyce, even mine.</HI></P>
<P>IT was a plea&s;ure to me, to &s;ee your ready and general attendance upon the late day of FASTING and PRAYER, and your diligent and affectionate attention to the me&s;&s;ages of GOD, then deliver'd to you.</P>
<P>WOULD to GOD, that this <HI>Sermon</HI> together with the &s;ea&s;onable and pungent Di&s;cour&s;e you had from my worthy Brother <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Allin</HI> of <HI>Brooklin.</HI></NOTE> on the &s;ame day, may in the hands of the Almighty Spirit be in&s;trumental to bring on the <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation,</HI> then earne&s;tly exhorted to, as the call of GOD to us by his <HI>Judg|ments,</HI> and by the EARTHQUAKE in a more particular manner.</P>

<P>IF the <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD, has been thus &s;triving with you, <HI>Quench not the Spirit; Work out your own Sal|vation with fear and trembling:</HI> for GOD will then <HI>work in you, both to will, and to do, of his own good plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>LET the Grace of GOD &s;hewn to others encourage and animate you, e&s;pecially if any Impre&s;&s;ions have been made, to cry earne&s;tly to GOD to &s;et them home.</P>

<P>SUCH Omi&s;&s;ions of Duty, and Commi&s;&s;ions of Evil, I call on you to bewail and reform, as you would be <HI>found of your Judge in peace.</HI></P>
<P>THIS you have been of late earne&s;tly exhorted to <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">from 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.14.</NOTE> and can any of you think, you &s;hall ever arrive to it, if &s;uch Admonitions and Calls of GOD, be not hearkned to?

<P>YOU can have no <HI>peace</HI> in your own <HI>Con&s;ciences,</HI> nor peace in the day of <HI>Death</HI> or <HI>Judgment,</HI> and this is what I would if po&s;&s;ible awak'n in you a due concern and &s;ollicitude about, as knowing what man|ner of per&s;ons you mu&s;t be in all holy <HI>conver&s;ation</HI> and <HI>godline&s;s,</HI> if you would be found <HI>blamele&s;s</HI> in that Day.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Reformation</HI> urg'd upon you, is to bring you into &s;uch a <HI>Conver&s;ation,</HI> that you may thereby lay a foundation for peace and comfort in the Day that is approching, that you may be accounted worthy to e&s;cape all the things that &s;hall come to pa&s;s, and to &s;tand before the <HI>Son of Man.</HI></P>
<P>AND for your Quickning; Suffer me to u&s;e with you the three following <HI>Motives.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="002861_0008_0FE679A7C26C3570">MOT. I. <HI>THE coming of the Lord is doubtle&s;s foretold to excite and quicken us to diligence in get|ting ready for it.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was written for our admonition and warn|ing upon whom the <HI>ends of the world are come.</HI> GOD fore&s;aw how carnally &s;ecure and &s;tupid a wicked World would be, how ready to put far from them the day of his coming; that they might therefore be rowz'd out of &s;uch &s;ecurity, he does by his Prophets and Apo&s;tles &s;olemnly warn a &s;ecure World to prepare for it, <HI>le&s;t coming &s;uddenly, he finds us &s;leeping.</HI> Now &s;urely, the Great GOD would not do thus, nor &s;peak &s;o much of his <HI>coming,</HI> were it not to quicken us to a diligent and in&s;tant preparing for it. Hence the Prophet <HI>Joel</HI> after he had prophe&s;y'd of the Terrible Day of the Lord approaching, he immediately exhorts to <HI>Repent, and turn to the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Joel</HI> 2.12.</NOTE>. So that it &s;eems evidently to be the great de&s;ign and end of GOD in denouncing his Judgments and particularly, in the awful predictions of that Great Day of the Lord's coming upon a &s;ecure World, to awaken Men to the utmo&s;t care and diligence in getting ready for his <HI>Coming.</HI></P>
<P>MOT. II. <HI>OUR Condition will be unutterably di&s;tre&s;&s;ing if we are not prepar'd for the Lords Com|ing, if we &s;hall then be found in a Chri&s;tle&s;s E&s;tate.</HI></P>
<P>IF that Great and Terrible Day we look for, &s;hould &s;peedily arrive, when <HI>the Heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e, and the Elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat, the Earth al&s;o, and the works that are therein, &s;hall be burnt up;</HI> and the Son of Man, the glorious Judge of the World, &s;hall per&s;onally and vi|&s;ibly de&s;cend with a glorious retinue of Holy Angels, and that voice, that <HI>Midnight</HI> cry, &s;hall be heard,
<PB N="vii" REF="002861_0009_0FE679A7E5002718">
ARISE YE DEAD, AND COME TO JUDGMENT; If this were to be the Day of the glorious de&s;cent of the Son of GOD, in which he were to puni&s;h with an Everla&s;ting de&s;truction from his pre&s;ence &amp; the glory of his power, all &s;uch as have not obey'd his Go&s;pel: How terrible mu&s;t his Approach be? Finding our &s;elves among the number of his Enemies, who would not have him to reign over us. We &s;hall in the mid&s;t of our confu&s;ion with <HI>bitterne&s;s of heart, and bitter wailing</HI> reflect on our pa&s;t refu&s;als of offer'd Grace and Mercy, when we were &s;o often intreated to be reconciled to GOD, to make ha&s;te to Chri&s;t, as our City of Refuge, that in &s;uch a day we might have been hid under the &s;hadow of his wings, and had a ble&s;&s;ed time of refre&s;hment from the pre&s;ence of the LORD:</P>
<P>WE &s;hall think with angui&s;h upon the many war|nings we had of &s;uch a day approaching, and ha&s;tning upon us, and yet that we &s;hould regard them no more: that we &s;hould notwith&s;tanding go on in the ways of our hearts and in the &s;ight of our eyes, ful|filling the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h, &amp; of the mind, without any grief or remor&s;e of Spirit at all therefor: that the calls we had to <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation</HI> one time after another, &s;hou'd be &s;o &s;lighted and di&s;regarded by us; that tho' Chri&s;t &s;tood &s;o long at the doors of our Souls, knocking for entrance, de&s;iring to come in, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us, for him&s;elf, that he might rule and reign in us, &amp; conform us to his holy Image and likene&s;s; that we notwith&s;tanding bolted the door fa&s;t again&s;t him, were &s;o &s;lothful and &s;luggi&s;h that we would not ari&s;e to let him in. And alas, We now &s;ee, we are mi&s;erable and undone without Him, that there's none can &s;ave or help us but Chri&s;t: Though it will be now in vain to look for Salvation from the Hills, or the Multitude of the Mountains, yet we &s;hall not forbear crying to the rocks &amp; mountains, we &s;ee making and trembling about us, to fall upon us, and hide us from the pre&s;ence of him that &s;its upon
<PB N="viii" REF="002861_0010_0FE679AF0E7C6790">
the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. We &s;hall dread to make our Per&s;onal appearance before the Judge of the whole Earth; How glad &s;hould we be, we might in a moment be annihilated, and return to our fir&s;t nothing? But when we &s;ee, we mu&s;t whether we will or no, immediately attend the Sum|mons, and appear before our Judge, and receive our Doom; Oh with what reluctance, &s;hame and regret, mu&s;t we be forc'd away to the Bar of GOD, whom we &s;hall behold as a <HI>con&s;uming Fire,</HI> ready to adjudge us to Everla&s;ting Fire with the Devil and his Angels, in this lower World all on Fire ready to devour us; How &s;hall we tremble, and die away with angui&s;h, to think, we mu&s;t now take up our dwelling in Flames, and though we &s;hould lift up our Eyes, and cry for a drop of Water, to cool us while &s;o tormented, there would be no hope of obtaining it.</P>
<P>IF We &s;hould beg &s;ome of the <HI>Saints</HI> to take pity on us, their bowels will not yern towards us; though they know us, as deform'd and wtetched as we ap|pear, and it may be were near and dear to us, while together on Earth, and were then willing to have done their utmo&s;t for our comfort, they will not at all relent for us, now, they'l be intirely &s;atisfy'd in the final determination of the <HI>Righteous Judge.</HI></P>
<P>NOR will the <HI>Holy Angels</HI> mini&s;ter to our relief, in that day: They were ever ready before, to do us acts of kindne&s;s, and many were the kind and good Offices done by them for us, and glad would they have been to have &s;een us heirs of Salvation, and to have mini&s;tred to us, as &s;uch, at &s;uch a Day; but &s;ince we were not by all the goodne&s;s of GOD, engag'd to love, and &s;erve, and live devoted to him, they'l know that our condemnation is ju&s;t, that we are ju&s;tly mi&s;erable, and de&s;erve no pity or relief from them, no more than from the Saints, and therefore they'l never hearken to any cries or intreaties from us. Which way &s;hall we then turn our &s;elves?&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="002861_0011_0FE679AF2FDA5DC0">SURELY we cant hope, nor in the lea&s;t expect, any relief from the <HI>Evil Angels;</HI> Though they &s;ooth'd and flatter'd us, while we hearkned to their vile &s;ol|licitations, as if there was no danger, we might go on &s;ecurely, and never feel &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions of the wrath of GOD, we were often threatn'd withal, they'l now its probable be &s;o far from attempting our relief, that they'l with cruel Joy be the executiouers of GOD'S holy vengeance on us; and will upbraid us exceed|ingly for our inexcu&s;able folly, in regarding their Sollicitations as we did, from one time to another, when even our own Con&s;ciences condemn'd us at the &s;ame time: They will be doubtle&s;s in&s;trumental of increa&s;ing, if po&s;&s;ible, our everla&s;ting vexation and &s;orrow, while tormented with them.</P>
<P>BUT cannot the <HI>Multitudes</HI> in torment with us, afford &s;ome relief; won't the va&s;t numbers of our <HI>Fellow-Creatures</HI> with us, be &s;ome alleviation, or in &s;ome Mea&s;ure abate our Torments? Surely we cant have the lea&s;t hope of this: the beholding of them in Torment may be an aggravation, or increa&s;e of ours: We may perhaps, behold &s;everal under the &s;ame condemnation, tearing them&s;elves and cur&s;ing of us, as having been in&s;trumental of their ruin, by our evil examples, by enticing them into tho&s;e paths that led down to tho&s;e Chambers of Death: If they had not hearkn'd to our Sollicitations to evil, and been Companions with us, they might have been rejoy|cing with Saints and Angels, in the Kingdom of GOD; but &s;uch was the pernicious bewitching in|fluence of our evil Conver&s;ation, that they were mi&s;erably deluded and led away thereby, and &s;o were never re&s;cued out of the paths of the de&s;troyer: With what indignation and revenge mu&s;t &s;uch behold one another, and how will &s;uch Reflections exa&s;perate their angry furious minds, and add to their extreme angui&s;h?</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="002861_0012_0FE679B1CF769E40">AND</P>
<P>FINALLY, When they con&s;ider, there will be no <HI>Intermi&s;&s;ion</HI> of their Torment, and no <HI>End</HI> of it, that the Worm &s;hall never Die, nor the Fire be ever Quenched; who can po&s;&s;ibly imagine how cutting and tormenting &s;uch Reflections mu&s;t be?</P>
<P>BUT its impo&s;&s;ible for me to give you any adaequate Ideas or conceptions thereof; I have now endeavour'd to rai&s;e &s;ome Ideas in your Minds of the mi&s;erable di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Condition you will be in, if found out of CHRIST at his <HI>Coming.</HI></P>
<P>AND I appeal to your <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> whether you have not the &s;ame Apprehen&s;ions as to tho&s;e, who will be then found in an Unconverted E&s;tate; and if you have, &s;hould not the Con&s;ideration of it, excite you to the utmo&s;t care and diligence, that you may be found of him in Peace?</P>
<P>AND thus I have con&s;ider'd &s;omething of the an|gui&s;h that mu&s;t fill the Souls of tho&s;e who &s;hall be found in a Chri&s;tle&s;s E&s;tate, if the Day of the Lord &s;hould immediately come upon us.</P>
<P>I will now go on to con&s;ider &s;omething of the like di&s;tre&s;s, of Chri&s;tle&s;s Souls in the day of their Death, when the Lord &s;hall in this way come unto them.</P>
<P>THE Lord may be yet <HI>Long-&s;uffering</HI> towards an evil World, and for wi&s;e and holy ends delay his <HI>Coming</HI> to <HI>Judgment;</HI> GOD may have yet more great and glorious things to accompli&s;h before his <HI>Coming,</HI> in this &s;en&s;e. But when it &s;hall be, is re|&s;erved as a &s;ecret in his own Eternal Councils: <HI>Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the Angels in Heaven, nor the Son of Man.</HI></P>

<P>I PERSWADE my &s;elf, this <HI>Text</HI> has imployed the thoughts of many of us, &s;ince we have felt the awful <HI>Shaking</HI> and <HI>Trembling</HI> of the EARTH under us, that we have been, and are now ready upon it to Cry out, <HI>My Fle&s;h Trembleth for fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI> It is a Day of no little di&s;tre&s;s, concern and fear, and it may well be &s;o; and what a holy and provoked GOD may be about to do with us, HE only knows.

<P>FOR An&s;wer,</P>
<P><HI>THE Judgments of GOD are tho&s;e manife&s;tati|ons of his vindictive or corrective Ju&s;tice, whereby He lets the World know, what a Sin-hating GOD He is.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002861_0021_0FE679C1B987BCC8">THESE Judgments are Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal. GOD can arm the whole Creation again&s;t us, and make every thing we enjoy to be de&s;tructive to us. GOD does not willingly afflict or greive the Children of Men; but when by their Sins they provoke Him, he &s;ends down his Judgments on them; the Judgments of GOD are the proper Object of a na|tural Mans fear, for hereby GOD di&s;covers his ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure at Sin, P&s;al. 9.15. <HI>The Lord is known by the Judgments which he executeth:</HI> Yea, Godly Men have been afraid of GOD'S Judgments; thus was the P&s;almi&s;t in the Text, <HI>I am afraid of thy Judgments;</HI> &s;o was holy Job, 31.23. <HI>De&s;truction from God was a terror to me.</HI> Various are the Judgments of GOD, and the rebukes of Heaven, we lye expo&s;ed unto, and are often &s;uffering and groaning under. The Great GOD who is holy in all his ways and righteous in all his works, is &s;ometimes provok'd to come out in Judgment, and to write bitter things again&s;t us in the way of his Providence. It is &s;ometimes the So|vereign and holy Plea&s;ure of GOD, to lay us under &s;ome &s;ore Judgments, and to threaten the infliction of yet more, and greater; There are the Judgments of <HI>Sword, Famine,</HI> and <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> the Lord often brings upon us. He &s;ometimes &s;ends cleane&s;s of teeth, a great &s;carcity of the nece&s;&s;aries of Life, &s;ometimes he with|holds the Rain, which makes the Earth Fruitful, cau&s;ing the <HI>Heavens over us to be as bra&s;s, and the earth under us as iron, and the rain of the land powder and du&s;t:</HI> We have &s;ometimes had &s;ad occa|&s;ion to &s;ay with the Prophet, Joel, <HI>chap.</HI> 1.19, <HI>The fire has devoured the pa&s;tures of the Wilderne&s;s, the rivers of water are dried up,</HI> &amp;c. So does GOD &s;ometimes vi&s;it his People with &s;corching Droughts, and &s;ometimes with long and exce&s;&s;ive Rains, the Fruits of the Earth have been often dimini&s;hed, the Trees not yeilded their Fruit, nor the Land its u&s;ual Increa&s;e.

Sickne&s;s, that proves Mortal, and &s;weeps away Multitudes, the &s;lain of the Lord have been awfully multiplied in one place and another; there is al&s;o the Judgment of the <HI>Sword,</HI> when GOD lets loo&s;e the enemy upon us, to wa&s;te our Sub&s;tance, and de|&s;troy the Lives of many. How dreadfully has a So|vereign and Righteous GOD puni&s;h'd us in Years pa&s;t, by long and bloody Wars, when we have &s;een <HI>Gar|ments roll'd in Blood, our young Men &s;lain,</HI> and many carried into a mi&s;erable Captivity, and there poy&s;on'd with the <HI>Romi&s;h Religion?</HI> There are al&s;o the Judg|ments of <HI>Storms and Tempe&s;ts of Wind, Thunder and Lightning,</HI> which we have &s;een and felt to an un|common degree, in the Weeks and Months that are pa&s;t; But a very few Weeks ago, upon the Evening before the Sabbath, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sept.</HI> 16.</NOTE> what a Violent Storm did the Lord bring down upon us, how awful were the Effects of it in our Orchards, and among the <HI>Trees of the Woods,</HI> in one place, and another, and not a little damage thereby &s;u&s;tained; yea &s;ome in the City were &s;orely Wounded, and One Slain. And now, upon the Evening after the Sabbath, the Lord has bro't up|on us, the unu&s;ual and terrible Judgment of the EARTHQUAKE; we have thus &s;een that awful word fulfill'd, I&s;a. 29.6. <HI>Thou &s;hall be vi&s;ited of the Lord of ho&s;ts, with thunder, and with Earthquake, and great noi&s;e, with &s;torm, and tempe&s;t, and flame of devouring fire;</HI> and that in P&s;al. 18.7. <HI>Then the Earth &s;hook and trembled, the foundations al&s;o of the hills moved, and were &s;haken &mdash;.</HI> Among the awful Judgments of GOD, this of the EARTHQUAKE is much &s;poken of. It is very particularly and mo&s;t awfully, in the <HI>twenty fourth Chapter of I&s;aiah,</HI> which you may do well to read this Day with a very great attention; I will &s;ingle out a few ver&s;es, and read them to you now; <HI>Behold the Lord maketh the

The haughty People of the Earth do langui&s;h; the earth al&s;o is defiled under the Inhabi|tants thereof, becau&s;e they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws, and broken the everla&s;ting covenant; therefore hath the Cur&s;e devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein, are de&s;olate, therefore the Inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left, all the merry hearted do &s;igh: the noi&s;e of them that rejoyce endeth; they &s;hall not drink wine with a &s;ong, &s;trong drink &s;hall be bitter to them that drink it; all joy is dark|ned, the mirth of the land is gone; in the City is left de&s;olation, fear, and the pit, and the &s;nare are upon thee, O Inhabitant of the earth; and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that he who fleeth from the noi&s;e of the fear, &s;hall fall into the pit, and he that cometh up out of the mid&s;t of the pit, &s;hall be taken in the &s;nare; for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do &s;hake: the earth is moved exceedingly, the earth &s;hall reel to and fro like a Drunkard: and the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion thereof &s;hall be heavy upon it, and it &s;hall fall and not ri&s;e again.</HI> In I&s;aiah, Chap. 2. from the 19 ver. we read, <HI>In that day, they &s;hall go into the holes of the Rocks, and into the caves of the earth for fear of the Lord, and the glory of his Maje&s;ty, when he ari&s;eth to &s;hake terribly the Earth.</HI> In the 13th Chap. at the 13th ver. we al&s;o read of the Lords <HI>Shaking the Heavens, and the Earth, removing out of her place;</HI> The Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> al&s;o &s;peaks of it, Ezek. 38.19, 20. <HI>In that day, there &s;hall be a great &s;haking in the Land,</HI> &amp;c.

great noi&s;e, and the Elements melt with fervent heat,</HI> &amp;c. So that, we may well look for &s;uch awful &s;hak|ing di&s;pen&s;ations, as we have been this Week under; They are indeed very terrible, and GOD only knows, what will be the i&s;&s;ue &mdash; It certainly looks as if GOD was very Angry with us, and we ripe for his terrible Judgments; And therefore when GOD threatens to bring them, and this of the <HI>Earthquake</HI> in a particular manner he &s;ays, I&s;a. 13.13. <HI>I will &s;hake the Heavens, and the Earth &s;hall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of ho&s;ts, and in the day of his fierce anger;</HI> And al&s;o in Ezek. 38.19. <HI>For in my Jealou&s;y, and in the fire of my wrath, have I &s;poken, &s;urely in that day there &s;hall be a great &s;haking in the land,</HI> &amp;c. Our Fle&s;h therefore trembles for fear of what GOD may be about to do, by this <HI>Judicial Di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> in a more e&s;pecial manner.</P>
<P>I might Finally, under this Head &s;peak of <HI>Spiritual Plagues and Judgments,</HI> we ly expos'd to, and its to be fear'd, many have dreadfully expos'd them&s;elves to their being inflicted on them, and the&s;e are the wor&s;t of Judgments, to be given up to blindne&s;s of mind, and hardne&s;s of heart, to be ca&s;t away from the pre&s;ence of GOD, and to have his holy Spirit cea&s;e &s;triving with us, to have the word, and means of grace made a &s;avour of Death unto Death, having a blinding and hardning efficacy on the hearts of Men. Oh Dreadful Judgments!

<P>THEY are outward and Temporal, and al&s;o Spiri|tual and Eternal Plagues and Judgments.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE Second thing propos'd was to &s;hew, <HI>What may be meant by Trembling for fear of GOD, and being afraid of his Judgments?</HI></P>
<P>AND here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT may mean, or imply in it, our Solemn &amp; Aw|ful Apprehen&s;ions of the Great GOD, who brings &s;uch Judgments upon us.</HI> That we adore his Infinite Wi&s;dom, and Almighty Power, adore Him as a GOD <HI>wi&s;e in heart, and mighty in &s;trength, again&s;t whom none ever hardned them&s;elves and pro&s;per'd, who re|moveth the mountains, and they know not, who over|turneth them in his anger, who &s;haketh the earth out of her place, and at who&s;e pre&s;ence the pillars thereof tremble:</HI> That we Sanctify the Lord of Ho&s;ts him&s;elf, and make Him our Fear and our Dread: That we adore his Sovereignty and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, in his awful di&s;pen&s;ations, that we imploy our &s;erious, devout, and &s;olemn thoughts on the&s;e, and other glorious Excellencies &amp; Perfections of Almighty GOD di&s;play'd in his Judgments; they mu&s;t be the Subject of our frequent &amp; &s;olemn Meditations, that &s;o we may always maintain on our Hearts &s;uitable Apprehen&s;ions of the Great GOD who &s;ends his Judgments upon us.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT may imply in it, and mean our being &s;en&s;ibly touched and affected with the con&s;ideration of the Judgments that are, or may be yet brought upon us.</HI> That we &s;o re&s;ent them, as that they make deep im|pre&s;&s;ions upon our Hearts, that our Spirits are mo&s;t &s;orrowfully affected with the tokens of the Divine

anger vi&s;ible therein; and that we weep bitterly in &s;ecret places, in the con&s;ideration thereof, wi&s;hing <HI>our heads were waters, and our eyes a fountain of tears, that we might weep day and night therefor.</HI> Thus griev'd and concern'd &s;hould we be continually, which may be very much meant by our <HI>trembling for fear of God, and being afraid of his Judgments.</HI> Our Hearts then being deeply &amp; &s;orrowfully affected with the Judgments of Heaven inflicted, or threatned, may be meant hereby.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>HEREBY may be meant our humbling our &s;elves exceedingly before GOD who is thus vi&s;iting, and threatning of us.</HI> That we lay our hands on our mouths, and our mouths in the du&s;t before Him, and there <HI>repent and abhor our &s;elves;</HI> that we do, while trembling before him, judge and condemn our &s;elves, acknowledging we are guilty before GOD, and that he might ju&s;tly be angry with us, till he hath con&s;um'd us, &s;o that there &s;hould be no remnant, nor e&s;caping. We mu&s;t humbly acknowledge and declare the Lord to be ju&s;t, in whatever He is plea&s;ed to lay upon us, that he does right, but we have done wickedly, that he puni&s;hes us much le&s;s than our iniquities have de&s;erv'd, that he &s;hall be therefore ju&s;tified when he &s;peaketh, and clear when he Judgeth, that we will accept the puni&s;hment of our Sins, and bear the indig|nation of the Lord, becau&s;e we have &s;inned again&s;t Him. That we continue &s;ighing and crying for the abominations that are committed among us, for the many provoking evils that are to be found in the mid&s;t of us, to the infinite di&s;honor of the Holy GOD, and the wounding of many precious Souls.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THIS may imply in it, the greatne&s;s of our fear and di&s;tre&s;s.</HI> It is here &s;poken, as if the appre|hen&s;ions
<PB N="10" REF="002861_0028_0FE679D3F3EE0588">
of GOD'S Judgments did &s;o affright the P&s;almi&s;t, as nothing el&s;e could.

So then they may imply, our fearing nothing &s;o much as the Lords anger in his judicial di&s;pen&s;ations; that the con&s;ideration hereof fills us with the greate&s;t fear and concern of Spirit, that GOD has been &s;o provok'd to come out again&s;t us in his Anger, and to threaten our utter ruin and de&s;olation.</P>
<P>Once more,</P>
<P N="5">5. &amp; la&s;tly, <HI>THS fear, and trembling may imply in it, a con&s;cientious and diligent care to avoid and for&s;ake every provoking evil, and repair to GOD in Chri&s;t, as our only City of Refuge for Safety.</HI> That our fear of GOD excites us <HI>to depart from all

<P>I Proceed now to the Third and la&s;t Head Propounded.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>THAT &s;uch may be our Condition and Circum&s;tances, that we may have abundant rea&s;on and occa&s;ion thus to Tremble and be Afraid.</HI></P>

a right &s;eed, How art thou turned into the degenerate, plant of a &s;trange vine unto me.</HI> It is recorded con|cerning the Children of I&s;rael, Judg. 2.17. <HI>They turned quickly out of the ways which their Fathers walked in, obeying the Commandments of the Lord; but they did not &s;o.</HI> Their Fathers did endeavour to uphold Religion in the power of it, but their Children did not &s;o. See how <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> once &s;pake to them, Numb. 32.14. <HI>Behold ye are ri&s;en up, in your Fathers &s;tead, an increa&s;e of &s;inful men.</HI> Alas! How much is it thus, at this Day; the fir&s;t Generation of Chri&s;tians is gone off the Stage, &amp; in a manner the &s;econd, and is there not another and a more &s;inful ri&s;en up in their &s;tead? We read in Joel 1.2. <HI>Hear this ye old Men, and give ear all ye Inhabitants of the land, hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your Fathers &s;aith the Lord.</HI> Were there &s;uch Judgments formerly, as now there are: You may therefore con|clude, you have departed from GOD, and by your &s;ins have provok'd him &s;o to puni&s;h you. And may it not be thus &s;aid, with reference to our &s;tate, and circum&s;tances &amp; the late di&s;pen&s;ations of GOD towards us, Alas! for us! Had we ever more rea&s;on to &s;tand trembling before GOD under fearful apprehen&s;ions of impending vengeance; when we con&s;ider of the many &s;candalous provoking evils abounding among us, &s;uch as <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion, Inju&s;tice, Cozning &amp; Deceit, Fal&s;|hood and Evil Speaking, Pride, and Contention, In|temperance, Drunkenne&s;s, Uncha&s;tity, an Exce&s;&s;ive In|ordinate love to the World,</HI> and I may add <HI>the Rude|ne&s;s and Profanene&s;s of Young People?</HI> How is GOD him&s;elf and our duty to him evidently neglected and forgotten by many, and a form of Godline&s;s maintain'd and kept up, without the life and power of it?

Finally here, Dont mu|tual Chri&s;tian love and Charity grow cold, the love of Men to GOD, and their Neighbour, a vi&s;ible cold|ne&s;s and indifference towards GOD and the power of Godline&s;s? Alas for this People!

<P>I Have wanted very much to write to, and hear from you, ever &s;ince the fir&s;t <HI>Earthquakes</HI> but I think, have &s;carce had time to write. The <HI>Earthquakes</HI> as far as I can hear, were much more terrible hereabouts than with you; I think there has not the &s;pace of 24 Hours pa&s;t, &s;ince the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> but we have heard them.</P>
<P>As to the Damage done by them, I &s;uppo&s;e you may have had a better Account than I can give, they &s;ay it has broke the Ground in many places in <HI>Newbury;</HI> in our <HI>Town</HI> I think no &s;uch thing has been ob&s;erv'd, but only &s;haking down Tops of Chimneys, &s;hattering &s;ome Brick Hou&s;es, and &s;haking others &s;o as to throw Pewter off the Shelves, make Andirons jump off the Hearth, throw down Stone Wall, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In our Hou&s;e it &s;top'd our Clock ju&s;t half an Hour pa&s;t 10. P. M.</P>
<P>We were in Bed, and I han't time to tell you how much we were &s;urpriz'd, and indeed almo&s;t all the good People, as well as bad in the <HI>Town.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;omething of the deep &amp; (I hope) <HI>good</HI> Im|pre&s;&s;ions it has made on us, I think my &s;elf concern'd in honour to our SAVIOUR to relate.</P>

<P>I've ju&s;t now on this occa&s;ion been looking over the additions made to our Church heretofore; and I find of 109 Per&s;ons that have owned the Covenant, &s;ince my Mini&s;try, 54 of them have done it &s;ince la&s;t <HI>May</HI> was twelve-month, and above 20 Young Per&s;ons unmarried, in the Summer pa&s;t.

<P>I need not make any reflections to you, on the&s;e things, I want very much to hear what effects the awful vi&s;itation has had near, and about you, and what are the thoughts of the mo&s;t Judicious about the <HI>Signs of the Times.</HI></P>
<P>I beg of you to &s;end me the be&s;t accounts, and com|municate this where you think proper; That they may Glorify GOD for our profe&s;&s;ed Subjection to the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and by their Prayers for &s;uch a mi&s;erable, &s;inful People, as in general we have been.</P>
<P>The Account I have given is in a degree (propor|tionably) true, as far as I can learn, of the Towns hereabouts, con&s;idering how much le&s;s rea&s;on they have had, to be Humbled and Reformed than We.</P>
<P>At <HI>Exeter</HI> I heard a Week ago, there had been 40 Per&s;ons Baptis'd &s;ince the EARTHQUAKE: At <HI>Alm&s;bury</HI> (as one inform'd me,) they &s;eem'd as if they were willing to &s;pend their whole time in the <HI>Wor|&s;hip</HI>

of GOD. Tho' too remarkably backward and &s;lothful in duty before.</P>
<P>But I have been &s;o bu&s;y at home, I've heard but very little from abroad; But after all, among <HI>Us,</HI> the Impre&s;&s;ion is not &s;o General, but there are &s;ome, alas too many, remaining to appearance ju&s;t where they were, in their former &s;ecurity, a Generation in their declining age, <HI>&s;ettled on their Lees,</HI> (a proof of the Sovereign Grace of GOD in effecting the&s;e things among us,) <HI>The Lord have Mercy on them.</HI></P>
<P>Begging your Prayers, the Impre&s;&s;ions &amp; Convicti|ons made on &s;o many, may I&s;&s;ue in a <HI>Repentance unto Salvation not to be repented of,</HI> and that we may be Prepared for all future events of <HI>Providence,</HI> yea, and for the <HI>Coming of the Day of GOD:</HI></P>
