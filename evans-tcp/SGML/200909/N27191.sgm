<P>THE original plan of my Fa|ther, the late Dr. Robert&s;on, with re&s;pect to the Hi&s;tory of Ameri|ca, comprehended not only an ac|count of the di&s;covery of that coun|try, and of the conque&s;ts and colo|nies of the Spaniards, but embraced al&s;o the hi&s;tory of the Briti&s;h and

Portugue&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments in the New World, and of the &s;ettlements made by the &s;everal nations of Europe in the We&s;t India I&s;lands. It was his intention not to have publi&s;hed any part of the Work until the whole was completed. In the Preface to his Hi&s;|tory of America, he has &s;tated the rea&s;ons which induced him to depart from that re&s;olution, and to publi&s;h the Two Volumes which contain an account of the di&s;covery of the New World, and of the progre&s;s of the Spani&s;h arms and colonies in that quarter of the globe. He &s;ays, "he had made &s;ome progre&s;s in the Hi&s;to|ry of Briti&s;h America;" and he an|nounces his intention to return to that part of his Work, as &s;oon as the fer|ment which at that time prevailed in the Briti&s;h Colonies in America, &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide, and regular government be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. Various cau&s;es con|curred
<PB N="v" REF="036237_0004_10088F0ADA4E11E0">
in preventing him from fulfil|ling his intention.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of a tedious ill|ne&s;s, which he early fore&s;aw would have a fatal termination, Dr. Robert|&s;on at different times de&s;troyed many of his papers. But after his death, I found that part of the Hi&s;tory of Briti&s;h America which he had wrote many years before, and which is now offered to the Public. It is written with his own hand, as all his Works were; it is as carefully corrected as a|ny part of his Manu&s;cripts which I have ever &s;een; and he had thought it worthy of being pre&s;erved, as it e&s;|caped the flames to which &s;o many o|ther papers had been committed. I read it with the utmo&s;t attention; but before I came to any re&s;olution about the publication, I put the MS. into the hands of &s;ome of tho&s;e friends whom my Father u&s;ed to con&s;ult on
<PB N="vi" REF="036237_0005_10088F0C6296DBC0">
&s;uch occa&s;ions, as it would have been ra&s;hne&s;s and pre&s;umption in me to have tru&s;ted to my own partial deci&s;ion. It was peru&s;ed by &s;ome other per&s;ons al|&s;o, in who&s;e ta&s;te and judgment I have the greate&s;t confidence; by all of them I was encouraged to offer it to the public, as a fragment curious and intere&s;ting in it&s;elf, and not inferior to any of my Father's Works.</P>
<P>When I determined to follow that advice, it was a circum&s;tance of great weight with me, that as I never could think my&s;elf at liberty to de&s;troy tho&s;e papers which my Father had thought worthy of being pre&s;erved, and as I could not know into who&s;e hands they might hereafter fall, I con&s;idered it as certain that they would be publi&s;hed at &s;ome future period, when they might meet with an Editor, who, not being actuated by the &s;ame &s;acred regard for the reputation of the Au|thor

which I feel, might make altera|tions and additions, and obtrude the whole on the Public as a genuine and authentic work. The MS. is now publi&s;hed, &s;uch as it was left by the Author; nor have I pre&s;umed to make any addition, alteration, or correcti|on whatever.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF AMERICA. BOOK IX.</HEAD>
<P>THE dominions of Great-Britain in A|merica are next in extent to tho&s;e of Spain. Its acqui&s;itions there are a recompence due to tho&s;e enterpri&s;ing talents which prompt|ed the Engli&s;h to enter early on the career of di&s;covery, and to pur&s;ue it with per&s;evering ar|dour. England was the &s;econd nation that ventured to vi&s;it the New World. The ac|count of Columbus's &s;ucce&s;sful voyage filled all Europe with a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration. But in England it did &s;omething more; it ex|cited a vehement de&s;ire of emulating the glo|ry of Spain, and of aiming to obtain &s;ome &s;hare in tho&s;e advantages which were expected in
<PB N="18" REF="036237_0015_10088F2AFB38B4A0">
this new field opened to national activity. The attention of the Engli&s;h court had been turned towards the di&s;covery of unknown countries, by its negociation with Barthole|mew Columbus. Henry VII. having li&s;tened to his propo&s;itions with a more favourable ear than could have been expected from a cautious, di&s;tru&s;tful prince, aver&s;e by habit as well as by temper to new and hazardous projects, he was more ea&s;ily induced to approve of a voyage for di&s;covery, propo&s;ed by &s;ome of his own &s;ub|jects, &s;oon after the return of Chri&s;topher Co|lumbus.</P>
<P>But though the Engli&s;h had &s;pirit to form this &s;cheme, they had not, at that period, at|tained to &s;uch &s;kill in navigation as qualified them for carrying it into execution. From the incon&s;iderate ambition of its monarchs, the nation had long wa&s;ted its genius and activity in pernicious and ineffectual efforts to conquer France. When this ill directed ardour began to abate, the fatal conte&s;t between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, turned the arms of one half of the kingdom again&s;t the other, and ex|hau&s;ted the vigour of both. During the cour&s;e of two centuries, while indu&s;try and commerce were making gradual progre&s;s, both in the &s;outh and north of Europe, the Engli&s;h conti|nued &s;o blind to the advantages of their own &s;ituation, that they hardly began to bend their
<PB N="19" REF="036237_0016_10088F2C84C93840">
thoughts towards tho&s;e objects and pur&s;uits, to which they are indebted for their pre&s;ent o|pulence and power. While the trading ve&s;&s;els of Italy, Spain, and Portugal, as well as tho&s;e of the Hans Towns, vi&s;ited the mo&s;t remote ports in Europe, and carried on an active inter|cour&s;e with its various nations, the Engli&s;h did little more than creep along their own coa&s;ts, in &s;mall barks, which conveyed the producti|ons of one country to another. Their com|merce was almo&s;t wholly pa&s;&s;ive. Their wants were &s;upplied by &s;trangers; and whatever ne|ce&s;&s;ary or luxury of life their own country did not yield, was imported in foreign bottoms. The Cro&s;s of St. George was &s;eldom di&s;play|ed beyond the precincts of the narrow &s;eas. Hardly any Engli&s;h &s;hip traded with Spain or Portugal, before the beginning of the fifteenth century; and half a century more elap&s;ed before the Engli&s;h mariners became &s;o adventurous as to enter the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>In this infancy of navigation, Henry could not commit the conduct of an armament, de&s;|tined to explore unknown regions, to his own &s;ubjects. He inve&s;ted Giovanni Gaboto, a Venetian adventurer, who had &s;ettled in Bri&s;tol, with the chief command; and i&s;&s;ued a com|mi&s;&s;ion to him and his three &s;ons, empowering them to &s;ail, under the banner of England, to|wards the ea&s;t, north, or we&s;t, in order to di&s;|cover
<PB N="20" REF="036237_0017_10088F2E1F835260">
countries unoccupied by any Chri&s;tian &s;tate; to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them in his name, and to carry on an exclu&s;ive trade with the in|habitants, under condition of paying a fifth part of the free profit on every voyage to the crown. This commi&s;&s;ion was granted on March 5th, 1495, in le&s;s than two years after the return of Columbus from America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hakluyt, iii. 4.</NOTE>. But Cabot (for that is the name he a&s;&s;umed in England, and by which he is be&s;t known) did not &s;et out on his voyage for two years. He, together with his &s;econd &s;on Seba&s;tian, embarked at Bri&s;tol, (May 1497) on board a &s;hip furni&s;h|ed by the king, and was accompanied by four &s;mall barks, fitted out by merchants of that city.</P>
<P>As in that age the mo&s;t eminent navigators, formed by the in&s;tructions of Columbus, or animated by his example, were guided by ideas derived from his &s;uperior knowledge and ex|perience, Cabot had adopted the &s;y&s;tem of that great man, concerning the probability of open|ing a new and &s;horter pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t-In|dies, by holding a we&s;tern cour&s;e. The opi|nion which Columbus had formed, with re&s;|pect to the i&s;lands which he had di&s;covered, was univer&s;ally received. They were &s;uppo&s;ed to lie contiguous to the great continent of In|dia,

was cautious of giving any offence to a prince, jealous to exce&s;s of all his rights. From the po&s;ition of the i&s;lands and continent which Cabot had di&s;covered, it was evident that they lay within the limits of the ample donative which the bounty of Alexander VI. had con|ferred upon Ferdinand and I&s;abella.

one period of it, the active part which he took in the affairs of the continent, and the vigour with which he engaged in the conte&s;t between the two mighty rivals, Charles V. and Francis I. gave full occupation to the en|terpri&s;ing &s;pirit both of the king and of his no|bility. During another period of his admini|&s;tration, his famous controver&s;y with the court of Rome kept the nation in perpetual agita|tion and &s;u&s;pen&s;e.

Though England, by its total &s;eparation from the church of Rome, &s;oon after the acce&s;&s;ion of Edward VI. di&s;claimed that authority, which, by its pre&s;umptuous partition of the globe between two favourite nations, circum|&s;cribed the activity of every other &s;tate within very narrow limits, yet a feeble minority, di&s;|tracted with faction, was not a juncture for forming &s;chemes of doubtful &s;ucce&s;s and re|mote utility.

<P>But though the public contributed little towards the progre&s;s of di&s;covery, naval &s;kill, knowledge of commerce, and a &s;pirit of en|terprize, began to &s;pread among the Engli&s;h.

<P>But the di&s;covery of a &s;horter pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies, by the north-we&s;t, was &s;till the favourite project of the nation, which beheld, with envy, the va&s;t wealth that flowed into Portugal, from its commerce with tho&s;e regi|ons.

<P>The vigour of the commercial &s;pirit did not relax in the reign of Edward VI.

Cabot, who&s;e o|pinion was de&s;ervedly of high authority in whatever related to naval enterprize, warmly urged the Engli&s;h to make another attempt to di&s;cover this pa&s;&s;age. As it had been thrice &s;earched for in vain, by &s;teering towards the north-we&s;t, he propo&s;ed that a trial &s;hould now be made by the north-ea&s;t; and &s;upported this advice by &s;uch plau&s;ible rea&s;ons and conjec|tures, as excited &s;anguine expectations of &s;uc|ce&s;s.

<P>Sir Hugh Willoughby, who was entru&s;ted with the command, &s;tood directly (May 10) northwards along the coa&s;t of Norway, and doubled the North Cape.

Thus far did the Engli&s;h advance during a period which may be con&s;idered as the infant &s;tate of their navigation and com|merce; and feeble as its &s;teps at that time may appear to us, we trace them with an intere&s;t|ing curio&s;ity, and look back with &s;atisfaction to the early e&s;&s;ays of that &s;pirit, which we now behold in the full maturity of its &s;trength.

<P>By the Progre&s;s which England had already made in navigation and commerce, it was now prepared for advancing further; and on the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth to the throne, a period commenced, extremely au&s;picious to this &s;pi|rit which was ri&s;ing in the nation.

The di&s;cerning eye of Eli|zabeth having early perceived that the &s;ecurity of a kingdom environed by the &s;ea, depended on its naval force, &s;he began her government with adding to the number and &s;trength of the royal navy; which, during a factious minori|ty, and a reign intent on no object but that of

In&s;tead of abandoning any of the new channels of commerce which had been opened in the three preceding reigns, the Engli&s;h frequented them with greater a&s;&s;iduity, and the patronage of their &s;overeign added vigour to all their efforts.

naval enterprize among the Engli&s;h, if it had not re&s;umed fre&s;h vigour, amid&s;t the general exultation of the nation, upon the &s;ucce&s;sful expedition of Francis Drake. That bold na|vigator, emulous of the glory which Magellan had acquired by &s;ailing round the globe, form|ed a &s;cheme of attempting a voyage, which all Europe had admired for &s;ixty years, with|out venturing to follow the Portugue&s;e di&s;co|verer in his adventurous cour&s;e. Drake un|dertook this with a feeble &s;quadron, in which the large&s;t ve&s;&s;el did not exceed a hundred tons, and he accompli&s;hed it, with no le&s;s credit to him&s;elf, than honour to his country. Even in this voyage, conducted with other views, Drake &s;eems not to have been inattentive to the favourite object of his countrymen, the di&s;covery of a new route to India. Before he quitted the Pacific Ocean, in order to &s;tretch towards the Philippine i&s;lands, he ranged along the coa&s;t of California, as high as the lattitude of forty-two degrees north, in hopes of di&s;co|vering, on that &s;ide, the communication be|tween the two &s;eas, which had &s;o often been &s;earched for in vain on the other. But this was the only un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt of Drake. The exce&s;&s;ive cold of the climate, intolerable to men who had long been accu&s;tomed to tro|pical heat, obliged him to &s;top &s;hort in his progre&s;s towards the north; and whether or not there be any pa&s;&s;age from the Pacific to

<P>From this period, the Engli&s;h &s;eem to have confided in their own abilities and courage, as equal to any naval enterprize. They had now vi&s;ited every region to which navigation ex|tended in that age, and had rivalled the nati|on of highe&s;t repute for naval &s;kill in its mo&s;t &s;plendid exploit. But notwith&s;tanding the knowledge which they had acquired of the different quarters of the globe, they had not hitherto attempted any &s;ettlement out of their own country. Their merchants had not yet acquired &s;uch a degree, either of wealth or of political influence, as were requi&s;ite towards carrying a &s;cheme of colonization into execu|tion. Per&s;ons of noble birth were de&s;titute of the ideas and information which might have di&s;po&s;ed them to patronize &s;uch a de&s;ign. The growing power of Spain, however, and the a&s;cendant over the other nations of Europe to which it had attained under Charles V. and his &s;on, naturally turned the attention of man|kind towards the importance of tho&s;e &s;ettle|ments in the New World, to which they were &s;o much indebted for that pre-eminence. The intercour&s;e between Spain and England, du|ring the reign of Philip and Mary; the re|&s;ort

of the Spani&s;h nobility to the Engli&s;h court, while Philip re&s;ided there; the &s;tudy of the Spani&s;h language, which became fa&s;hion|able; and the tran&s;lation of &s;everal hi&s;tories of America into Engli&s;h, diffu&s;ed gradually through the nation a more di&s;tinct knowledge of the policy of Spain in planting its colonies, and of the advantages which it derived from them. When ho&s;tilities commenced between Elizabeth and Philip, the pro&s;pect of annoy|ing Spain by &s;ea opened a new career to the enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h nobility. Almo&s;t every eminent leader of the age aimed at di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf by naval exploits. That &s;ervice, and the ideas connected with it, the di&s;covery of unknown countries, the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of di&s;tant colonies, and the enrich|ing of commerce by new commodities, became familiar to per&s;ons of rank.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of all tho&s;e concurring cau|&s;es, the Engli&s;h began &s;eriou&s;ly to form plans of &s;ettling colonies in tho&s;e parts of America, which hitherto they had only vi&s;ited. The projectors and patrons of the&s;e plans were mo&s;tly per&s;ons of rank and influence. Among them, Sir Humphry Gilbert of Compton in Devon&s;hire, ought to be mentioned with the di&s;tinction due to the conductor of the fir&s;t Engli&s;h colony to America. He had early rendered him&s;elf con&s;picuous by his military

<P>As this is the fir&s;t charter to a colony, granted by the Crown of England, the arti|cles in it merit particular attention, as they un|fold the ideas of that age, with re&s;pect to the nature of &s;uch &s;ettlements.

<P>With tho&s;e extraordinary powers, &s;uited to the high notions of authority and prerogative prevalent in England during the &s;ixteenth cen|tury, but very repugnant to more recent ideas with re&s;pect to the rights of free men, who voluntarily unite to form a colony, Gilbert began to collect a&s;&s;ociates, and to prepare for embarkation. His own character, and the zealous efforts of his half-brother, Walter Ralegh, who, even in his early youth, di&s;|played tho&s;e &s;plendid talents, and that un|daunted &s;pirit, which create admiration and confidence, &s;oon procured him a &s;ufficient number of followers. But his &s;ucce&s;s was not &s;uited either to the &s;anguine hopes of his countrymen, or to the expence of his prepa|rations.

<P>But the mi&s;carriage of a &s;cheme, in which Gilbert had wa&s;ted his fortune, did not di&s;|courage Ralegh. He adopted all his brother's ideas; and applying to the Queen, in who&s;e favour he &s;tood high at that time, he pro|cured a patent, (1584, March 26) with. ju|ri&s;diction and prerogatives as ample as had been granted unto Gilbert.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hakluyt, iii. 243.</NOTE> Ralegh, no le&s;s eager to execute than to undertake the &s;cheme, in&s;tantly di&s;patched (April 27) two &s;mall ve&s;|&s;els, under the command of Amadas and Bar|low, two officers of tru&s;t, to vi&s;it the coun|tries which he intended to &s;ettle, and to ac|quire &s;ome previous knowledge of their coa&s;ts, their &s;oil, and productions. In order to avoid Gilbert's error, in holding too far north, they

took their cour&s;e by the Canaries and the We&s;t India i&s;lands, and approached the North American continent by the Gulph of Florida. Unfortunately their chief re&s;earches were made in that part of the country now known by the name of North Carolina, the province in America mo&s;t de&s;titute of commodious har|bours. They touched fir&s;t at an i&s;land, which they call Wokocon (probably Ocakoke,) &s;itu|ated on the inlet into Pamplicoe Sound, and then at Raonoke, near the mouth of Albe|marle Sound. In both, they had &s;ome inter|cour&s;e with the natives, whom they found to be &s;avages, with all the characteri&s;tic qualities of uncivilized life, bravery, aver&s;ion to labour, ho&s;pitality, a propen&s;ity to admire, and a wil|lingne&s;s to exchange their rude productions for Engli&s;h commodities, e&s;pecially for iron, or any of the u&s;eful metals of which they were de&s;titute.

<P>Their report encouraged Ralegh to ha&s;ten his preparations for taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an inviting property. He fitted out a &s;quadron of &s;even &s;mall &s;hips, under the command of Sir Richard Greenville, a man of honourable birth, and of courage &s;o undaunted as to be con&s;picuous even in that gallant age. But the &s;pirit of that predatory war which the Engli&s;h carried on again&s;t Spain, mingled with this &s;cheme of &s;ettlement; and on this account, as well as from unacquaintance with a more direct and &s;horter cour&s;e to North America, Greenville &s;ailed by the We&s;t India i&s;lands. He &s;pent &s;ome time in crui&s;ing a|mong the&s;e, and in taking prizes; &s;o that it was towards the clo&s;e of June before he arriv|ed on the coa&s;t of North America. He touched at both the i&s;lands where Amadas and Barlow had landed, and made &s;ome excur&s;ions into different parts of the continent round Pamplicoe and Albemarle Sounds. But as, unfortunately, he did not advance far enough towards the north, to di&s;cover the noble Bay of Che&s;apeak, he e&s;tabli&s;hed the colony (Au|gu&s;t 25) which he left on the i&s;land of Raon|oke, an incommodious &s;tation, without any &s;afe harbour, and almo&s;t uninhabited.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hakluyt, iii. 251.</NOTE></P>

Early in the following year, (1587) he fitted out three &s;hips, under the command of Captain John White, who carried thither a colony more numerous than that which had been &s;ettled under Lane. On their arrival in Virginia, af|ter viewing the face of the country covered with one continued fore&s;t, which to them ap|peared an uninhabited wild, as it was occu|pied only by a few &s;cattered tribes of &s;avages, they di&s;covered that they were de&s;titute of many things which they deemed e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary towards their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in &s;uch an uncomfortable &s;ituation; and, with one voice, reque&s;ted White, their commander, to return to England, as the per&s;on among them mo&s;t likely to &s;olicit, with efficacy, the &s;upply on which depended the exi&s;tence of the colony.

univer&s;al alarm at the formidable preparations of Philip II. to invade England, and collect|ing all its force to oppo&s;e the fleet to which he had arrogantly given the name of the In|vincible Armada.

He had begun to form his favourite, but vi&s;i|onary plan, of penetrating into the province of Guiana, where he fondly dreamed of taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of inexhau&s;tible wealth, flowing from the riche&s;t mines in the New World. Amid&s;t this multiplicity of projects, of &s;uch promi&s;ing appearance, and recommended by novelty, he naturally became cold towards his ancient and hitherto unprofitable &s;cheme of &s;ettling a colony in Virginia, and was ea&s;ily induced to a&s;&s;ign his right of property in that country, which he had never vi&s;ited, together with all the privileges contained in his patent, to Sir Thomas Smith, and a company of mer|chants in London (March, 1596.) This com|pany, &s;atisfied with a paltry traffic carried on by a few &s;mall barks, made no attempt to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country. Thus, after a period of a hundred and &s;ix years from the time that Cabot di&s;covered North America, in the name of Henry VII. and of twenty years from the time that Ralegh planted the fir&s;t colony, there was not a &s;ingle Engli&s;hman &s;ettled there at the demi&s;e of Queen Elizabeth, in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and three.</P>

Even the felicity of her govern|ment was adver&s;e to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of re|mote colonies. So powerful is the attraction of our native &s;oil, and &s;uch our fortunate par|tiality to the laws and manners of our own country, that men &s;eldom choo&s;e to abandon it, unle&s;s they be driven away by oppre&s;&s;ion, or allured by va&s;t pro&s;pects of &s;udden wealth. But the provinces of America in which the Engli&s;h attempted to &s;ettle, did not, like tho&s;e occupied by Spain, invite them thither by any appearance of &s;ilver or golden mines. All their hopes of gain were di&s;tant; and they &s;aw
<PB N="54" REF="036237_0051_1008910C672B9E50">
that nothing could be earned but by per&s;ever|ing exertions of indu&s;try. The maxims of Elizabeth's admini&s;tration were, in their ge|neral tenor, &s;o popular, as did not force her &s;ubjects to emigrate, in order to e&s;cape from the heavy or vexatious hand of power. It &s;eems to have been with difficulty that the&s;e &s;lender bands of planters were collected, on which the writers of that age be&s;tow the name of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Virginian colo|nies. The fulne&s;s of time for Engli&s;h colo|nization was not yet arrived.</P>
<P>But the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Scotti&s;h line to the crown of England ha&s;tened its approach. James was hardly &s;eated on the throne before he di&s;covered his pacific intentions, and he &s;oon terminated the long war which had been carried on between Spain and England, by an amicable treaty. From that period, uninter|rupted tranquillity continued during his reign. Many per&s;ons of high rank, and of ardent am|bition, to whom the war with Spain had af|forded con&s;tant employment, and pre&s;ented alluring pro&s;pects, not only of fame but of wealth, &s;oon became &s;o impatient of langui&s;h|ing at home without occupation or object, that their invention was on the &s;tretch to find &s;ome exerci&s;e for their activity and talents. To both the&s;e, North America &s;eemed to open a new field, and &s;chemes of carrying colonies
<PB N="55" REF="036237_0052_1008910F5AF4A668">
thither became more general and more po|pular.</P>
<P>A voyage, undertaken by Bartholemew Go&s;|nold in the la&s;t year of the Queen, facilitated, as well as encouraged, the execution of the&s;e &s;chemes. He &s;ailed from Falmouth in a &s;mall bark, with thirty two men. In&s;tead of fol|lowing former navigators in their unnece&s;&s;ary circuit by the We&s;t India i&s;les and the Gulf of Florida, Go&s;nold &s;teered due we&s;t, as nearly as the winds would permit, and was the fir&s;t Engli&s;h commander who reached Ame|rica by this &s;horter and more direct cour&s;e. That part of the continent which he fir&s;t de|&s;cried was a promontory in the province now called Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay, to which he gave the name of Cape Cod. Holding along the coa&s;t, as it &s;tretched towards the &s;outh-we&s;t, he touched at two i&s;lands, one of which he call|ed Martha's Vineyard, the other Elizabeth's I&s;land; and vi&s;ited the adjoining continent, and traded with its inhabitants. He and his com|panions were &s;o much delighted every where with the inviting a&s;pect of the country, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;mallne&s;s of their num|ber, a part of them con&s;ented to remain there. But when they had lei&s;ure to reflect upon the fate of former &s;ettlers in America, they re|tracted a re&s;olution formed in the fir&s;t warmth of their admiration; and Go&s;nold returned to

England in le&s;s than four months from the time of his departure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, iv. p. 1647.</NOTE></P>
<P>This voyage, however incon&s;iderable it may appear, had important effects. The Engli&s;h now di&s;covered the a&s;pect of the American continent to be extremely inviting far to the north of the place where they had formerly at|tempted to &s;ettle. The coa&s;t of a va&s;t coun|try, &s;tretching through the mo&s;t de&s;irable cli|mates, lay before them. The richne&s;s of its virgin &s;oil promi&s;ed a certain recompence to their indu&s;try. In its interior provinces unex|pected &s;ources of wealth might open, and un|known objects of commerce might be found. Its di&s;tance from England was dimini&s;hed al|mo&s;t a third part, by the new cour&s;e which Go&s;nold had pointed out. Plans for e&s;tabli&s;h|ing colonies began to be formed in different parts of the kingdom; and before the&s;e were ripe for execution, one &s;mall ve&s;&s;el was &s;ent out by the merchants of Bri&s;tol, another by the Earl of Southampton and Lord Arundel of Wardour, in order to learn whether Go&s;|nold's account of the country was to be con|&s;idered as a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of its &s;tate, or as the exaggerated de&s;cription of a fond di&s;|coverer. Both returned with a full confir|mation of his veracity, and with the addition
<PB N="57" REF="036237_0054_100891141C4BF520">
of &s;o many new circum&s;tances in favour of the country, acquired by a more exten&s;ive view of it, as greatly increa&s;ed the de&s;ire of plant|ing it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t active and efficacious promoter of this was Richard Hakluyt, prebendary of We&s;t|min&s;ter, to whom England is more indebted for its American po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions than to any man of that age. Formed under a kin&s;man of the &s;ame name, eminent for naval and commercial knowledge, he imbibed a &s;imilar ta&s;te, and applied early to the &s;tudy of geography and na|vigation. The&s;e favourite &s;ciences engro&s;&s;ed his attention, and to diffu&s;e a reli&s;h for them was the great object of his life. In order to excite his countrymen to naval enterprize, by flattering their national vanity, he publi&s;hed, in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and eighty nine, his valuable collection of voyages and di&s;|coveries made by Engli&s;hmen. In order to &s;upply them with what information might be derived from the experience of the mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful foreign navigators, he tran&s;lated &s;ome of the be&s;t accounts of the progre&s;s of the Spaniards and Portugue&s;e in their voyages both to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, into the Engli&s;h tongue. He was con&s;ulted with re&s;pect to many of the attempts towards di&s;covery or co|lonization during the latter part of Elizabeth's reign. He corre&s;ponded with the officers who
<PB N="58" REF="036237_0055_10089116A33A0930">
conducted them, directed their re&s;earches to proper objects, and publi&s;hed the hi&s;tory of their exploits. By the zealous endeavours of a per&s;on, equally re&s;pected by men of rank and men of bu&s;ine&s;s, many of both orders formed an a&s;&s;ociation to e&s;tabli&s;h colonies in America, and petitioned the king for the &s;anction of his authority to warrant the execution of their plans.</P>
<P>James, who prided him&s;elf on his profound &s;kill in the &s;cience of government, and who had turned his attention to con&s;ider the advan|tages which might be derived from colonies, at a time when he patroni&s;ed a &s;cheme for planting them in &s;ome of the ruder provinces of his ancient kingdom, with a view of in|troducing indu&s;try and civilization there,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. of Scotland, ii. 239.</NOTE> was now no le&s;s fond of directing the active genius of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, towards occupations not repugnant to his own pacific maxims, and li&s;tened with a favourable ear to their applica|tion. But as the extent as well as value of the American continent began now to be better known, a grant of the whole of &s;uch a va&s;t region to any one body of men, however re|&s;pectable, appeared to him an act of impolitic and profu&s;e liberality. For this rea&s;on, he di|vided that portion of North America, which
<PB N="59" REF="036237_0056_10089119D2A65678">
&s;tretches from the thirty-fourth to the forty-fifth degree of latitude, into two di&s;tricts, nearly equal; the one called the fir&s;t or &s;outh colony of Virginia, the other, the &s;econd or north colony. He authorized (1606, April 10) Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Summers, Richard Hakluyt, and their a&s;&s;ociates, mo&s;tly re&s;ident in London, to &s;ettle any part of the former which they &s;hould choo&s;e, and ve&s;ted in them a right of property to the land ex|tending along the coa&s;t fifty miles on each &s;ide of the place of their fir&s;t habitation, and reaching into the interior country a hundred miles. The latter di&s;trict he allotted, as the place of &s;ettlement, to &s;undry knights, gen|tlemen, and merchants of Bri&s;tol, Plymouth, and other parts in the we&s;t of England, with a &s;imilar grant of territory. Neither the mo|narch who i&s;&s;ued this charter, nor his &s;ubjects who received it, had any conception that they were proceeding to lay the foundation of migh|ty and opulent &s;tates. What James granted was nothing more than a &s;imple charter of corporation to a trading company, empower|ing the members of it to have a common &s;eal, and to act as a body politic. But as the object for which they a&s;&s;ociated was new, the plan e&s;tabli&s;hed for the admini&s;tration of their af|fairs was uncommon. In&s;tead of the power u&s;ually granted to corporations, of electing of|ficers and framing by-laws for the conduct of
<PB N="60" REF="036237_0057_1008911DEE9310B0">
their own operations, the &s;upreme govern|ment of the colonies to be &s;ettled, was ve&s;ted in a council re&s;ident in England, to be named by the king, according to &s;uch laws and ordi|nances as &s;hould be given under his &s;ign ma|nual; and the &s;ubordinate juri&s;diction was committed to a council re&s;ident in America, which was likewi&s;e to be nominated by the king, and to act conformably to his in&s;truc|tions. To this important clau&s;e, which re|gulated the form of their con&s;titution, was added, the conce&s;&s;ion of &s;everal immunities, to encourage per&s;ons to &s;ettle in the intended colonies. Some of the&s;e were the &s;ame which had been granted to Gilbert and Ralegh; &s;uch as the &s;ecuring to the emigrants and their de|&s;cendants all the rights of denizens, in the &s;ame manner as if they had remained or had been born in England; and granting them the privilege of holding their lands in America by the free&s;t and lea&s;t burden&s;ome tenure. Others were more favourable than tho&s;e granted by Elizabeth. He permitted whatever was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;u&s;tenance or commerce of the new colonies to be exported from England, during the &s;pace of &s;even years, without pay|ing any duty; and as a farther incitement to indu&s;try, he granted them liberty of trade with other nations, and appropriated the duty to be levied on foreign commodities, for twen|ty-one

<P>In this &s;ingular charter, the contents of which have been little attended to by the hi&s;|torians of America, &s;ome articles are as unfa|vourable to the rights of the coloni&s;ts, as others are to the intere&s;t of the parent &s;tate. By placing the legi&s;lative and executive powers in a council nominated by the crown, and guided by its in&s;tructions, every per&s;on &s;ettling in America, &s;eems to be bereaved of the noble&s;t privilege of a free man; by the unlimited per|mi&s;&s;ion of trade with foreigners, the parent &s;tate is deprived of that exclu&s;ive commerce which has been deemed the chief advantage re&s;ulting from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of colonies. But in the infancy of colonization, and with|out the guidance of ob&s;ervation or experience, the ideas of men with re&s;pect to the mode of forming new &s;ettlements, were not fully un|folded, or properly arranged. At a period when they could not fore&s;ee the future gran|deur and importance of the communities which they were about to call into exi&s;tence, they were ill qualified to concert the be&s;t plan for governing them. Be&s;ides, the Engli&s;h of that age, accu&s;tomed to the high prerogative and arbitrary rule of their monarchs, were not

animated with &s;uch liberal &s;entiments, either concerning their own per&s;onal or political rights, as have become familiar in the more mature and improved &s;tate of their con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Without he&s;itation or reluctance the propri|etors of both colonies prepared to execute their re&s;pective plans; and under the authority of a charter, which would now be rejected with di&s;dain, as a violent inva&s;ion of the &s;a|cred and inalienable rights of liberty, the fir&s;t permanent &s;ettlements of the Engli&s;h in America were e&s;tabli&s;hed. From this period, the progre&s;s of the two provinces of Virginia and New England form a regular and con|nected &s;tory. The former in the &s;outh, and the latter in the north, may be con&s;idered as the original and parent colonies; in imitation of which, and under who&s;e &s;helter, all the others have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively planted and reared.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t attempts to occupy Virginia and New England were made by very feeble bodies of emigrants. As the&s;e &s;ettled, under great di&s;advantages, among tribes of &s;avages, and in an uncultivated de&s;ert; as they attained gradu|ally, after long &s;truggles and many di&s;a&s;ters, to that maturity of &s;trength, and order of po|licy, which entitles them to be con&s;idered as re&s;pectable &s;tates, the hi&s;tory of their per&s;e|vering

<P>Though many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction became proprietors in the company which undertook to plant a colony in Virginia, its funds &s;eem not to have been con&s;iderable, and its fir&s;t ef|fort was certainly extremely feeble. A &s;mall ve&s;&s;el of a hundred tons, and two barks, un|der the command of Captain Newport, &s;ailed
<PB N="64" REF="036237_0061_10088EF74F45BAA0">
(Dec. 19) with a hundred and five men, de&s;|tined to remain in the country. Some of the&s;e were of re&s;pectable families, particularly a bro|ther of the Earl of Northumberland, and &s;e|veral officers who had &s;erved with reputation in the reign of Elizabeth. Newport, I know not for what rea&s;on, followed the ancient cour&s;e by the We&s;t Indies, and did not reach the coa&s;t of North America for four months (1607, April 26). But he approached it with better fortune than any former navigator; for having been driven, by the violence of a &s;torm, to the northward of Roanoke, the place of his de&s;tination, the fir&s;t land he di&s;|covered was a promontory which he called Cape Henry, the &s;outhern boundary of the Bay of Che&s;apeak. The Engli&s;h &s;tood direct|ly into that &s;pacious inlet, which &s;eemed to invite them to enter; and as they advanced, contemplated, with a mixture of delight and admiration, that grand re&s;ervoir, into which are poured the waters of all the va&s;t rivers, which not only diffu&s;e fertility through that di&s;trict of America, but open the interior parts of the country to navigation, and render a commercial intercour&s;e more exten&s;ive and commodious than in any other region of the globe. Newport, keeping along the &s;outhern &s;hore, &s;ailed up a river, which the natives call|ed Powhatan, and to which he gave the name of James-River. After viewing its banks,
<PB N="65" REF="036237_0062_10089128F7AC5990">
during a run of above forty miles from its mouth, they all concluded that a country, where &s;afe and convenient harbours &s;eemed to be numerous, would be a more &s;uitable &s;ta|tion for a trading colony, than the &s;hoally and dangerous coa&s;t to the &s;outh, on which their countrymen had formerly &s;ettled. Here then they determined to abide; and having cho&s;en a proper &s;pot for their re&s;idence, they gave this infant &s;ettlement the name of James-Town, which it &s;till retains; and though it has never become either populous or opulent, it can boa&s;t of being the mo&s;t ancient habita|tion of the Engli&s;h in the New World. But however well-cho&s;en the &s;ituation might be, the members of the colony were far from a|vailing them&s;elves of its advantages. Violent animo&s;ities had broke out among &s;ome of their leaders, during their voyage to Virginia. The&s;e did not &s;ub&s;ide on their arrival there. The fir&s;t deed of the council, which a&s;&s;umed the government in virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion brought from England under the &s;eal of the company, and opened on the day after they landed, was an act of inju&s;tice. Captain Smith, who had been appointed a member of the council, was excluded from his &s;eat at the board, by the mean jealou&s;y of his colleagues, and not only reduced to the condition of a private man, but of one &s;u&s;pected and watched by his &s;uperiors. This diminution of his influence, and re&s;traint

on his activity, was an e&s;&s;ential injury to the colony, which at that juncture &s;tood in need of the aid of both. For &s;oon after they be|gan to &s;ettle, the Engli&s;h were involved in a war with the natives, partly by their own in|di&s;cretion, and partly by the &s;u&s;picion and fe|rocity of tho&s;e barbarians. And although the Indians, &s;cattered over the countries adjacent to James-River, were divided into independent tribes, &s;o extremely feeble that hardly one of them could mu&s;ter above two hundred warri|ors,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, vol. iv. 1692. Smith's Travels, p. 23.</NOTE> they teazed and annoyed an infant colo|ny by their ince&s;&s;ant ho&s;tilities. To this was added a calamity &s;till more dreadful; the &s;tock of provi&s;ions left for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, on the departure of their &s;hips for England, (June 15) was &s;o &s;canty, and of &s;uch bad quality, that a &s;carcity, approaching almo&s;t to ab&s;olute fa|mine, &s;oon followed. Such poor unwhole|&s;ome fare brought on di&s;ea&s;es, the violence of which was &s;o much increa&s;ed by the &s;ultry heat of the climate, and the moi&s;ture of a country covered with wood, that before the beginning of September, one half of their number died, and mo&s;t of the &s;urvivors were &s;ickly and dejected. In &s;uch trying extremi|ties, the comparative powers of every indivi|dual are di&s;covered and called forth, and each naturally takes that &s;tation, and a&s;&s;umes that

a&s;cendant, to which he is entitled by his talents and force of mind. Every eye was now turned towards Smith, and all willingly devolved on him that authority, of which they had formerly deprived him. His undaunted temper, deeply tinctured with the wild roman|tic &s;pirit characteri&s;tic of military adventures in that age, was peculiarly &s;uited to &s;uch a &s;itu|ation. The vigour of his con&s;titution conti|nued, fortunately, &s;till unimpaired by di&s;ea&s;e, and his mind was never apalled by danger. He in&s;tantly adopted the only plan that could &s;ave them from de&s;truction. He began by &s;ur|rounding James-Town with &s;uch rude fortifi|cations, as were a &s;ufficient defence again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of &s;avages. He then marched, at the head of a &s;mall detachment, in que&s;t of their enemies. Some tribes he gained by care&s;&s;es and pre&s;ents, and procured from them a &s;upply of provi&s;ions. Others he attacked with open force; and defeating them on every occa&s;ion, whatever their &s;uperiority in numbers might be, compelled them to impart to him &s;ome portion of their winter &s;tores. As the recom|pence of all his toils and dangers, he &s;aw a|bundance and contentment re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the colony, and hoped that he &s;hould be able to maintain them in that happy &s;tate, until the arrival of &s;hips from England in the &s;pring: but in one of his excur&s;ions he was &s;urpri&s;ed
<PB N="68" REF="036237_0065_1008A332193B4A20">
by a numerous body of Indians, and in mak|ing his e&s;cape from them, after a gallant de|fence, he &s;unk to the neck in a &s;wamp, and was obliged to &s;urrender. Though he knew well what a dreadful fate awaits the pri&s;oners of &s;avages, his pre&s;ence of mind did not for|&s;ake him. He &s;hewed tho&s;e who had taken him captive a mariner's compa&s;s, and amu&s;ed them with &s;o many wonderful accounts of its virtues, as filled them with a&s;toni&s;hment and veneration, which began to operate very pow|erfully in his favour. They led him, howe|ver, in triumph through various parts of the country, and conducted him at la&s;t to Powha|tan, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Sachim in that part of Virginia. There the doom of death being pronounced, he was led to the place of execu|tion, and his head already bowed down to re|ceive the fatal blow, when that fond attachment of the American women to their European in|vaders, the beneficial effects of which the Spa|niards often experienced, interpo&s;ed in his be|half. The favourite daughter of Powhatan ru&s;hed in between him and the executioner, and, by her intreaties and tears, prevailed on her father to &s;pare his life. The beneficence of his deliverer, whom the early Engli&s;h wri|ters dignify with the title of the Prince&s;s Po|cahuntas, did not terminate here; &s;he &s;oon after procured his liberty, and &s;ent him

<P>Smith, on his return to James-Town, found the colony reduced to thirty-eight per&s;ons, who, in de&s;pair, were preparing to abandon a country which did not &s;eem de&s;tined to be the habitation of Engli&s;hmen. He employed ca|re&s;&s;es, threats, and even violence, in order to pre|vent them from executing this fatal re&s;olution. With difficulty he prevailed on them to defer it &s;o long, that the &s;uccour anxiou&s;ly expected from England arrived. Plenty was in&s;tantly re&s;tored; a hundred new planters were added to their number, and an ample &s;tock of what|ever was requi&s;ite for clearing and &s;owing the ground was delivered to them. But an un|lucky incident turned their attention from that &s;pecies of indu&s;try which alone could render their &s;ituation comfortable. In a &s;mall &s;tream of water that i&s;&s;ued from a bank of &s;and near James-Town, a &s;ediment of &s;ome &s;hining mi|neral &s;ub&s;tance, which had &s;ome re&s;emblance of gold, was di&s;covered. At a time when the precious metals were conceived to be the pecu|liar and only valuable productions of the New World, when every mountain was &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a trea&s;ure, and every rivulet was &s;earch|ed for its golden &s;ands, this appearance was

<P>The effects of this fatal delu&s;ion were &s;oon felt. Notwith&s;tanding all the provident acti|vity of Smith, in procuring corn from the na|tives by traffic or by force, the colony began to &s;uffer as much as formerly from &s;carcity of food, and was wa&s;ted by the &s;ame di&s;tempers. In hopes of obtaining &s;ome relief, Smith pro|po&s;ed, as they had not hitherto extended their re&s;earches beyond the countries contiguous to James-River, to open an intercour&s;e with the more remote tribes, and to examine into the &s;tate of culture and population among them. The execution of this arduous de&s;ign he un|dertook him&s;elf, in a &s;mall open boat, with a feeble crew, and a very &s;canty &s;tock of provi|&s;ions. He began his &s;urvey at Cape Charles,

and in two different excur&s;ions, which conti|nued above four months, he advanced as far as the river Su&s;quehannah, which flows into the bottom of the Bay. He vi&s;ited all the countries both on the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;hores; he entered mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable creeks; he &s;ailed up many of the great rivers as far as their falls. He traded with &s;ome tribes; he fought with others; he ob&s;erved the nature of the territory which they occupied, their mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the peculiarities in their manners; and left among all a wonderful admiration ei|ther of the beneficence or valour of the En|gli&s;h. After &s;ailing above three thou&s;and miles in a paltry ve&s;&s;el, ill fitted for &s;uch an exten|&s;ive navigation, during which the hard&s;hips to which he was expo&s;ed, as well as the patience with which he endured, and the fortitude with which he &s;urmounted them, equal whatever is related of the celebrated Spani&s;h di&s;coverers in their mo&s;t daring enterprizes; he returned to James-Town; he brought with him an ac|count of that large portion of the American continent now comprehended in the two pro|vinces of Virginia and Maryland,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's Travels, p. 65, &amp;c.</NOTE> &s;o full and exact, that after the progre&s;s of information and re&s;earch for a century and a half, his map exhibits no inaccurate view of both coun|tries, and is the original upon which all &s;ub|&s;equent

<P>But, whatever plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of future benefit might open upon this complete di&s;co|very of a country, formed by nature to be the feat of an exclu&s;ive commerce, it afforded but little relief for their pre&s;ent wants. The co|lony &s;till depended for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence chiefly on &s;upplies from the natives; as, after all the ef|forts of their own indu&s;try, hardly thirty acres of ground were yet cleared &s;o as to be capable of culture.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stith, p. 97.</NOTE> By Smith's attention, however, the &s;tores of the Engli&s;h were &s;o regularly filled, that for &s;ome time they felt no con&s;ider|able di&s;tre&s;s; and at this juncture a change was made in the con&s;titution of the company, which &s;eemed to promi&s;e an increa&s;e of their &s;ecurity and happine&s;s. That &s;upreme direc|tion of all the company's operations, which the king by his charter had re&s;erved to him&s;elf, di&s;couraged per&s;ons of rank or property from becoming members of a &s;ociety &s;o dependant on the arbitrary will of the crown. Upon a repre&s;entation of this to James, (1609, May 23) he granted them a new charter, with more ample privileges. He enlarged the boun|daries of the colony; he rendered the powers of the company, as a corporation, more ex|plicit

and complete; he aboli&s;hed the juri&s;|diction of the council re&s;ident in Virginia; he ve&s;ted the government entirely in a council re&s;iding in London; he granted to the propri|etors of the company the right of electing the per&s;ons who were to compo&s;e this council, by a majority of voices; he authorized this coun|cil to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch laws, orders, and forms of government and magi&s;tracy, for the colony and plantation, as they in their di&s;cretion &s;hould think to be fitte&s;t for the good of the adventurers and inhabitants there; he empow|ered them to nominate a governor to have the admini&s;tration of affairs in the colony, and to carry their orders into execution.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stith.

<P>The fir&s;t deed of the new council was to ap|point Lord Delaware governor and captain-general of their colony in Virginia. To a per&s;on of his rank, tho&s;e high-&s;ounding titles could be no allurement; and by his thorough acquaintance with the progre&s;s and &s;tate of the &s;ettlement, he knew enough of the labour and difficulty with which an infant colony is rear|ed,

to expect any thing but anxiety and care in di&s;charging the duties of that delicate office. But from zeal to promote an e&s;tabli&s;hment which he expected to prove &s;o highly beneficial to his country, he was willing to relinqui&s;h all the comforts of an honourable &s;tation, to undertake a long voyage to &s;ettle in an un|cultivated region, de&s;titute of every accommo|dation to which he had been accu&s;tomed, and where he fore&s;aw that toil and trouble and dan|ger awaited him. But as he could not imme|diately leave England, the council di&s;patched Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Summers, the former of whom had been appointed lieu|tenant-general, and the latter admiral, with nine &s;hips and five hundred planters. They carried with them commi&s;&s;ions, by which they were empowered to &s;uper&s;ede the juri&s;dic|tion of the former council, to proclaim Lord Delaware governor, and, until he &s;hould ar|rive, to take the admini&s;tration of affairs into their own hands. A violent hurricane &s;epa|rated the ve&s;&s;el in which Gates and Summers had embarked, from the re&s;t of the fleet, and &s;tranded it on the coa&s;t of Bermudas. The other &s;hips arrived (Augu&s;t 11) &s;afely at James-Town. But the fate of their com|manders was unknown.

government, however, was held to be abo|li&s;hed. No legal warrant could be produced for e&s;tabli&s;hing any other. Smith was not in a condition at this juncture to a&s;&s;ert his own rights, or to act with his wonted vigour. By an accidental explo&s;ion of gunpowder, he had been &s;o mi&s;erably &s;corched and mangled, that he was incapable of moving, and under the nece&s;&s;ity of committing him&s;elf to the guid|ance of his friends, who carried him aboard one of the &s;hips returning to England, in hopes that he might recover by more &s;kilful treat|ment than he could meet with in Virginia.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, iv. 1734, &amp;c.

<P>After his departure, every thing tended fa&s;t to the wilde&s;t anarchy. Faction and di&s;con|tent had often ri&s;en &s;o high among the old &s;ettlers, that they could hardly be kept within bounds. The &s;pirit of the new-comers was too ungovernable to bear any re&s;traint. Seve|ral among them of better rank were &s;uch di&s;|&s;ipated hopele&s;s young men, as their friends were glad to &s;end out in que&s;t of whatever for|tune might betide them in a foreign land. Of the lower order, many were &s;o profligate or de&s;perate, that their country was happy to throw them out as nui&s;ances in &s;ociety. Such per&s;ons were little capable of the regular &s;ub|ordination, the &s;trict oeconomy, and per&s;ever|ing

indu&s;try, which their &s;ituation required. The Indians ob&s;erving their mi&s;conduct, and that every precaution for &s;u&s;tenance or &s;afety was neglected, not only withheld the &s;upplies of provi&s;ions which they were accu&s;tomed to furni&s;h, but hara&s;&s;ed them with continual ho&s;|tilities. All their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was derived from the &s;tores which they had brought from Eng|land; the&s;e were &s;oon con&s;umed; then the dome&s;tic animals &s;ent out to breed in the coun|try were devou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed; and by this incon&s;iderate wa&s;te, they were reduced to &s;uch extremity of famine, as not only to eat the mo&s;t nau&s;eous and unwhole&s;ome roots and berries, but to feed on the bodies of the Indians whom they &s;lew, and even on tho&s;e of their companions who &s;unk under the oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch com|plicated di&s;tre&s;s. In le&s;s than &s;ix months, of five hundred per&s;ons whom Smith left in Vir|ginia, only &s;ixty remained; and the&s;e &s;o feeble and dejected, that they could not have &s;urvived for ten days, if &s;uccour had not arrived from a quarter whence they did not expect it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stith, p. 116.

<P>When Gates and Summers were thrown a&s;hore on Bermudas, fortunately not a &s;ingle per&s;on on board their &s;hip peri&s;hed. A con|&s;iderable part of their provi&s;ions and &s;tores too was &s;aved, and in that delightful &s;pot, Nature,

with &s;pontaneous bounty, pre&s;ented to them &s;uch a variety of her productions, that a hun|dred and fifty people &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in affluence for ten months on an uninhabited i&s;land. Impa|tient, however, to e&s;cape from a place where they were cut off from all intercour&s;e with mankind, they &s;et about building two barks with &s;uch tools and materials as they had, and by amazing efforts of per&s;everance and inge|nuity they fini&s;hed them. In the&s;e they em|barked, and &s;teered directly towards Virginia, in hopes of finding an ample con&s;olation for all their toils and dangers in the embraces of their companions, and amid&s;t the comforts of a flouri&s;hing colony. After a more pro&s;pe|rous navigation than they could have expected in their ill-con&s;tructed ve&s;&s;els, they landed (May 23) at James-Town. But in&s;tead of that joyful interview for which they fondly looked, a &s;pectacle pre&s;ented it&s;elf which &s;truck them with horror. They beheld the mi&s;erable remainder of their countrymen ema|ciated with famine and &s;ickne&s;s, &s;unk in de|&s;pair, and in their figure and looks rather re|&s;embling &s;pectres than human beings. As Gates and Summers, in full confidence of find|ing plenty of provi&s;ions in Virginia, had brought with them no larger &s;tock than was deemed nece&s;&s;ary for their own &s;upport during the voyage, their inability to afford relief to their countrymen, added to the angui&s;h with which

they viewed this unexpected &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s. Nothing now remained but in&s;tantly to aban|don a country, where it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ub&s;i&s;t any longer; and though all that could be found in the &s;tores of the colony, when added to what remained of the &s;tock brought from Bermudas, did not amount to more than was &s;ufficient to &s;upport them for &s;ixteen days, at the mo&s;t &s;canty allowance, they &s;et &s;ail, in hopes of being able to reach Newfoundland, where they expected to be relieved by their countrymen, employed at that &s;ea&s;on in the fi&s;hery there.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A minute and curious account of the &s;hipwreck of Gates and Summers, and of their adventures in Bermudas, was compo&s;ed by Strachy, a gentleman who accompanied them, and was publi&s;h|ed by Purchas, iv. 1734.</NOTE></P>
<P>But it was not the will of Heaven that all the labour of the Engli&s;h, in planting this colony, as well as all their hopes of benefit from its future po&s;terity, &s;hould be forever lo&s;t. Before Gates, and the melancholy companions of his voyage, had reached the mouth of James-River, they were met by Lord Delaware, with three &s;hips, that brought a large recruit of provi&s;ions, a con&s;iderable number of new &s;ettlers, and every thing requi&s;ite for defence or cultivation. By per&s;ua&s;ion and authority he prevailed on them to return to James-Town, where they found their fort, their magazines,
<PB N="79" REF="036237_0076_1008A355F50B8760">
and hou&s;es entire, which Sir Thomas Gates, by &s;ome happy chance, had pre&s;erved from be|ing &s;et on fire at the time of their departure. A &s;ociety &s;o feeble and di&s;ordered in its frame required a tender and &s;kilful hand to cheri&s;h it, and re&s;tore its vigour. This it found in Lord Delaware; he &s;earched into the cau&s;es of their misfortunes, as far as he could di&s;cover them, amid&s;t the violence of their mutual ac|cu&s;ations; but in&s;tead of exerting his power in puni&s;hing crimes that were pa&s;t, he em|ployed his prudence in healing their di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and in guarding again&s;t a repetition of the fame fatal errors. By unwearied a&s;&s;iduity, by the re&s;pect due to an amiable and beneficent character, by knowing how to mingle &s;everity with indulgence, and when to a&s;&s;ume the dig|nity of his office, as well as when to di&s;play the gentlene&s;s natural to his own temper, he gradually reconciled men corrupted by anarchy to &s;ubordination and di&s;cipline, he turned the attention of the idle and profligate to indu&s;try, and taught the Indians again to reverence and dread the Engli&s;h name (1611, March 28). Under &s;uch an admini&s;tration, the colony be|gan once more to a&s;&s;ume a promi&s;ing appear|ance; when unhappily for it, a complication of di&s;ea&s;es brought on by the climate obliged Lord Delaware to quit the country;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stith, p. 117.

This &s;y&s;tem of government is &s;o violent and arbitrary, that even the Spaniards them&s;elves had not ventured to introduce it in|to their &s;ettlements; for among them, as &s;oon as a plantation began, and the arts of peace &s;uc|ceeded to the operations of war, the juri&s;diction of the civil magi&s;trate was uniformly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. But however uncon&s;titutional or op|pre&s;&s;ive this may appear, it was adopted by the advice of Sir Francis Bacon, the mo&s;t en|lightened philo&s;opher, and one of the mo&s;t eminent lawyers of the age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, E&s;&s;ay on Plantations, p. 5&punc;</NOTE> The compa|ny, well acquainted with the inefficacy of eve|ry method which they had hitherto employ|ed for re&s;training the unruly mutinous &s;pirits which they had to govern, eagerly adopted a plan that had the &s;anction of &s;uch high au|thority to recommend it.

which the &s;ummary mode of military pu|ni&s;hment gave to his admini&s;tration, he in|troduced into the colony more perfect order than had ever been e&s;tabli&s;hed there; and at the &s;ame time he tempered its vigour with &s;o much di&s;cretion, that no alarm &s;eems to have been given by this formidable innovation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stith, p. 122.</NOTE></P>
<P>The regular form which the colony now be|gan to a&s;&s;ume, (1612, March 12) induced the King to i&s;&s;ue a new charter for the en|couragement of the adventurers, by which he not only confirmed all their former privileges, and prolonged the term of exemption from payment of duties on the commodities export|ed by them, but granted them more exten&s;ive property, as well as more ample juri&s;diction. All the i&s;lands lying within three hundred leagues of the coa&s;t were annexed to the Pro|vince of Virginia. In con&s;equence of this, the company took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bermudas, and the other &s;mall i&s;les di&s;covered by Gates and Summers; and at the &s;ame time prepared to &s;end out a con&s;iderable reinforcement to the colony at James-Town.

<P>By the &s;evere di&s;cipline of martial law, the activity of the coloni&s;ts was forced into a pro|per direction, and exerted it&s;elf in u&s;eful in|du&s;try. This, aided by a fertile &s;oil and fa|vourable climate, &s;oon enabled them to rai&s;e &s;uch a large &s;tock of provi&s;ions, that they were no longer obliged to tru&s;t for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the precarious &s;upplies which they obtained or extorted from the Indians. In proportion as the Engli&s;h became more independent, the natives courted their friend&s;hip upon more equal terms. The happy effects of this were quickly felt.

Pocahuntas, the fa|vourite daughter of the great Chief Powhatan, to who&s;e interce&s;&s;ion Captain Smith was in|debted for his life, per&s;evered in her partial at|tachment to the Engli&s;h; and as &s;he frequent|ly vi&s;ited their &s;ettlements, where &s;he was al|ways received with re&s;pectful ho&s;pitality, her admiration of their arts and manners continued to increa&s;e.

Where manners are &s;imple, court&s;hip is not tedious. Neither artifice prevents, nor ceremony forbids the heart from declaring its &s;entiments. Po|cahuntas readily gave her con&s;ent; Dale encou|raged the alliance, and Powhatan did not di&s;|approve it. The marriage was celebrated with extraordinary pomp; and from that period a

<P>During the interval of tranquillity procured by the alliance with Powhatan, an important change was made in the &s;tate of the colony. Hitherto no right of private property in land had been e&s;tabli&s;hed. The fields that were cleared had been cultivated by the joint labour of the coloni&s;ts; their product was carried to the common &s;tore-hou&s;es, and di&s;tributed weekly to every family, according to its num|ber and exigencies. A &s;ociety, de&s;titute of the fir&s;t advantage re&s;ulting from &s;ocial union, was not formed to pro&s;per. Indu&s;try, when not excited by the idea of property in what was acquired by its own efforts, made no vigorous exertion. The head had no inducement to contrive, nor the hand to labour. The idle and improvident tru&s;ted entirely to what was i&s;&s;ued from the common &s;tore; the a&s;&s;iduity even of the &s;ober and attentive relaxed, when they perceived that others were to reap the fruit of their toil; and it was computed, that
<PB N="86" REF="036237_0083_1008A338CAC95E28">
the united indu&s;try of the colony did not ac|compli&s;h as much work in a week as might have been performed in a day, if each indivi|dual had laboured on his own account. In or|der to remedy this, Sir Thomas Dale divided a con&s;iderable portion of the land into &s;mall lots, and granted one of the&s;e to each individual in full property. From the moment that indu&s;|try had the certain pro&s;pect of a recompence, it advanced with rapid progre&s;s. The articles of primary nece&s;&s;ity were cultivated with &s;o much attention as &s;ecured the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; and &s;uch &s;chemes of improvement were formed as prepared the way for the intro|duction of opulence into the colony.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's Travels, p. 114. Stith, p. 131.</NOTE></P>
<P>The indu&s;trious &s;pirit, which began to ri&s;e among the planters, was &s;oon directed towards a new object; and they applied to it for &s;ome time with &s;uch incon&s;iderate ardour as was productive of fatal con&s;equences. The cul|ture of tobacco, which has &s;ince become the &s;taple of Virginia, and the &s;ource of its pro&s;|perity, was introduced about this time (1616) into the colony. As the ta&s;te for that weed continued to increa&s;e in England, notwith|&s;tanding the zealous declamations of James again&s;t it, the tobacco imported from Virgi|nia came to a ready market; and though it

was &s;o much inferior in quality or in e&s;tima|tion to that rai&s;ed by the Spaniards in the We&s;t Indian i&s;lands, that a pound of the latter &s;old for eighteen &s;hillings, and of the former for no more than three &s;hillings, it yielded a con&s;iderable profit. Allured by the pro&s;pect of &s;uch a certain and quick return, every other &s;pecies of indu&s;try was neglected. The land which ought to have been re&s;erved for rai&s;ing provi&s;ions, and even the &s;treets of James-Town, were planted with tobacco. Various regulations were framed to re&s;train this ill-directed activity. But from eagerne&s;s for pre&s;ent gain, the planters di&s;regarded every admonition. The means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence became &s;o &s;canty as forced them to renew their de|mands upon the Indians, who, &s;eeing no end of tho&s;e exactions, their antipathy to the Eng|li&s;h name revived with additional rancour, and they began to form &s;chemes of vengeance, with the &s;ecrecy and &s;ilence peculiar to Ame|ricans.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stith, p. 140. 147. 164. 168.

<P>Meanwhile the colony, notwith&s;tanding this error in its operations, and the cloud that was gathering over its head, continued to wear an a&s;pect of pro&s;perity. Its numbers increa&s;ed by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive migrations; the quantity of tobacco exported became every year more con&s;iderable,

and &s;everal of the planters were not only in an ea&s;y &s;ituation, but advancing fa&s;t to opulence;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith, p. 139.</NOTE> and by two events, which happened nearly at the &s;ame time, both population and indu&s;try were greatly promoted. As few women had hitherto ventured to encounter the hard&s;hips which were unavoidable in an unknown and uncultivated country, mo&s;t of the coloni&s;ts, con&s;trained to live &s;ingle, con&s;idered them|&s;elves as no more than &s;ojourners in a land to which they were not attached by the tender ties of a family and children. In order to induce them to &s;ettle there, the company took advantage of the apparent tranquillity in the country, to &s;end out a con&s;iderable num|ber of young women, of humble birth, in|deed, but of unexceptionable character, and en|couraged the planters, by premiums and im|munities, to marry them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stith, p. 166. 197</NOTE> The&s;e new com|panions were received with &s;uch fondne&s;s, and many of them &s;o comfortably e&s;tabli&s;hed, as invited others to follow their example, and by degrees thoughtle&s;s adventurers, a&s;&s;uming the &s;entiments of virtuous citizens and of pro|vident fathers of families, became &s;olicitous about the pro&s;perity of a country, which they now con&s;idered as their own. As the coloni&s;ts began to form more exten&s;ive plans of indu&s;try, they were unexpectedly furni&s;hed with means
<PB N="89" REF="036237_0086_1008A36B55065300">
of executing them with greater facility. A Dutch &s;hip from the Coa&s;t of Guinea, having &s;ailed up James-River, &s;old a part of her car|go of negroes to the planters;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beverley, p. 37.</NOTE> and as that hardy race was found more capable of endur|ing fatigue under a &s;ultry climate than Euro|peans, their number has been increa&s;ed by con|tinual importation; their aid &s;eems now to be e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence of the colony, and the greater part of field labour in Virginia is per|formed by &s;ervile hands.</P>
<P>But as the condition of the colony improv|ed, the &s;pirit of its members became more in|dependent. To Engli&s;hmen the &s;ummary and &s;evere deci&s;ions of martial law, however tem|pered by the mildne&s;s of their governors, ap|peared intolerably oppre&s;&s;ive; and they longed to recover the privileges to which they had been accu&s;tomed under the liberal form of go|vernment in their native country. In compli|ance with this &s;pirit, Sir George Yeardley, in the year 1619, called the fir&s;t general a&s;&s;em|bly that was ever held in Virginia; and the numbers of the people were now &s;o increa&s;ed, and their &s;ettlements &s;o di&s;per&s;ed, that eleven corporations appeared by their repre&s;entatives in this convention, where they were permitted to a&s;&s;ume legi&s;lative power, and to exerci&s;e the

noble&s;t function of free men. The laws en|acted in it &s;eem neither to have been many, nor of great importance; but the meeting was highly acceptable to the people, as they now beheld among them&s;elves an image of the Eng|li&s;h con&s;titution, which they reverenced as the mo&s;t perfect model of free government. In order to render this re&s;emblance more com|plete, and the rights of the planters more cer|tain, the company i&s;&s;ued a charter (July 24) or ordinance, which gave a legal and per|manent form to the government of the colony. The &s;upreme legi&s;lative authority in Virginia, in imitation of that in Great Britain, was di|vided and lodged partly in the governor, who held the place of the &s;overeign; partly in a council of &s;tate named by the company, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the di&s;tinctions, and exerci&s;ed &s;ome of the functions belonging to the peer|age; partly in a general council or a&s;&s;embly compo&s;ed of the repre&s;entatives of the people, in which were ve&s;ted powers and privileges &s;i|milar to tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of Commons. be both the&s;e councils all que&s;tions were to In determined by the majority of voices, and a negative was re&s;erved to the governor; but no law or ordinance, though approved of by all the three members of the legi&s;lature, was to be of force, until it was ratified in England by a general court of the company, and returned

<P>The natural effect of that happy change in their condition was an increa&s;e of their indu&s;|try. The product of tobacco in Virginia was now equal, not only to the con&s;umption of it in Great Britain,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is a matter of &s;ome curio&s;ity to trace the progre&s;s of the con&s;umption of this unnece&s;&s;ary commodity.

Upon an average of the &s;even years immediately preceding the year 1622, the whole import of to|bacco into England amounted to a hundred and forty-two thou&s;and and eighty-five pounds weight.

interpo&s;ed with vigour to check this innovation. Some expedient was found, by which the matter was adju&s;ted for the pre&s;ent; but it is remarkable as the fir&s;t in&s;tance of a difference in &s;entiment between the parent &s;tate and the colony, concerning their re&s;pective rights. The former concluded, that the trade of the colony &s;hould be confined to England, and all its productions be landed there. The latter claimed, not only the general privilege of Engli&s;hmen, to carry their commodities to the be&s;t market, but pleaded the particular conce&s;&s;ions in their charter, by which an un|limited freedom of commerce &s;eemed to be granted to them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stith, p. 200, &amp;c.</NOTE> The time for a more full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this important que&s;tion was not yet arrived.</P>

They neither attended to the movements of the Indians, nor &s;u&s;pected their machinations, and though &s;urrounded by a people whom they might have known from experience

to be both artful and vindictive, they neglected every precaution for their own &s;afety that was requi&s;ite in &s;uch a &s;ituation. Like the peace|ful inhabitants of a &s;ociety completely e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, they were no longer &s;oldiers but citizens, and were &s;o intent on what was &s;ub&s;ervient to the comfort or embelli&s;hment of civil life, that every martial exerci&s;e began to be laid a&s;ide as unnece&s;&s;ary. The Indians, whom they com|monly employed as hunters, were furni&s;hed with fire-arms, and taught to u&s;e them with dexterity. They were permitted to frequent the habitations of the Engli&s;h at all hours, and received as innocent vi&s;itants whom there was no rea&s;on to dread. This incon&s;iderate &s;ecu|rity enabled the Indians to prepare for the ex|ecution of that plan of vengeance, which they meditated with all the deliberate forethought which is agreeable to their temper. Nor did they want a leader capable of conducting their &s;chemes with addre&s;s. On the death of Pow|hatan, in the year 1618, Opechancanough &s;uc|ceeded him, not only as wirowanee or chief of his own tribe, but in that exten&s;ive influence over all the Indian nations of Virginia, which induced the Engli&s;h writers to di&s;tingui&s;h them by the name of Emperor. According to the Indian tradition, he was not a native of Vir|ginia, but came from a di&s;tant country to the &s;outh-we&s;t, po&s;&s;ibly from &s;ome province of

Soon after his elevation to the &s;upreme com|mand, a general ma&s;&s;acre of the Engli&s;h &s;eems to have been re&s;olved upon; and during four years, the means of perpetrating it with the greate&s;t facility and &s;ucce&s;s were concerted with amazing &s;ecrecy. All the tribes contiguous to the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively gain|ed, except tho&s;e on the Ea&s;tern &s;hore, from whom, on account of their peculiar attach|ment to their new neighbours, every circum|&s;tance that might di&s;cover what they intended was carefully concealed. To each tribe its &s;ta|tion was allotted, and the part it was to act pre&s;cribed.

Indians ru&s;hed at once upon them in all their different &s;ettlements, and murdered men, wo|men, and children, with undi&s;tingui&s;hing rage, and that rancorous cruelty with which &s;avages treat their enemies. In one hour, nearly a fourth part of the whole colony was cut off, almo&s;t without knowing by who&s;e hands they fell.

The Indians, like men acquainted with the principles of integrity and good faith, on which the intercour&s;e between nations is founded, confided in the reconcilia|tion, and lived in ab&s;olute &s;ecurity without &s;u&s;picion of danger; while the Engli&s;h, with perfidious craft, were preparing to imitate &s;a|vages in their revenge and cruelty. On the approach of harve&s;t, when they knew an ho&s;|tile attack would be mo&s;t formidable and fatal, they fell &s;uddenly upon all the Indian planta|tions, murdered every per&s;on on whom they could lay hold, and drove the re&s;t to the woods, where &s;o many peri&s;hed with hunger, that &s;ome of the tribes neare&s;t to the Engli&s;h were totally extirpated. This atrocious deed, which the perpetrators laboured to repre&s;ent as a nece&s;&s;ary act of retaliation, was followed by &s;ome happy effects.

<P>But unfortunately at this juncture the &s;tate of the company in England, in which the pro|perty of Virginia and the government of the colony &s;ettled there were ve&s;ted, prevented it from &s;econding the efforts of the planters, by &s;uch a reinforcement of men, and &s;uch a &s;up|ply

<P>As the king did not often a&s;&s;emble the great council of the nation in parliament, the gene|ral courts of the company became a theatre, on which popular orators di&s;played their ta|lents; the proclamations of the crown, and acts of the privy council, with re&s;pect to the commerce and police of the colony, were can|va&s;&s;ed there with freedom, and cen&s;ured with &s;everity, ill-&s;uited to the lofty ideas which James entertained of his own wi&s;dom, and the extent of his prerogative. In order to check this growing &s;pirit of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the mini&s;ters employed all their addre&s;s and influence to gain as many members of the company as might give them the direction of their deliberations. But &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful were they in this attempt, that every mea&s;ure propo&s;ed by them was re|probated by a va&s;t majority, and &s;ometimes without any rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they were the propo&s;ers of it. James, little favourable to the power of any popular a&s;&s;embly, and weary of contending with one over which he had la|boured in vain to obtain an a&s;cendant, began to entertain thoughts of di&s;&s;olving the com|pany, and of new-modelling its con&s;titution.

The &s;low progre&s;s of the colony, the large &s;ums of money expended, and great num|ber of men who had peri&s;hed in attempting to plant it, the late ma&s;&s;acre by the Indians, and every di&s;a&s;ter that had befallen the Engli&s;h from their fir&s;t migration to America, were imputed &s;olely to the inability of a numerous company to conduct an enterpri&s;e &s;o complex and ar|duous. The nation felt &s;en&s;ibly its di&s;ap|pointment in a &s;cheme in which it had en|gaged with &s;anguine expectations of advantage, and wi&s;hed impatiently for &s;uch an impartial &s;crutiny into former proceedings, as might &s;ugge&s;t more &s;alutary mea&s;ures in the future admini&s;tration of the colony. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of its affairs, as well as the wi&s;hes of the people, &s;eemed to call for the interpo&s;ition of the crown; and James, eager to di&s;play the &s;uperiority of his royal wi&s;dom, in correcting tho&s;e errors into which the company had been betrayed by inexperience in the arts of govern|ment, boldly undertook the work of reforma|tion. Without regarding the rights conveyed to the company by their charter, and without the formality of any judicial proceeding for annulling it, he, by virtue of his prerogative, i&s;&s;ued a commi&s;&s;ion, (1623, May 9) empow|ering &s;ome of the judges, and other per&s;ons of note, to examine into all the tran&s;actions of the company from its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, and

<P>Charles I. on his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, (1625, March 27) adopted all his father's maxims with re&s;pect to the colony in Virginia.

A pro|clamation was i&s;&s;ued, by which, under pretexts equally ab&s;urd and frivolous, they were prohi|bited from &s;elling tobacco to any per&s;on but certain commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by the king to purcha&s;e it on his account;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, xviii. 19.</NOTE> and they had the cruel mortification to behold the &s;overeign, who &s;hould have afforded them protection, en|gro&s;s all the profits of their indu&s;try, by &s;eiz|ing the only valuable commodity which they had to vend, and retaining the monopoly of it in his own hands.

<P>The murmurs and complaints which &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration excited, were aug|mented by the rigour with which Sir John Harvey, who &s;ucceeded Yardely in the govern|ment of the colony,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, xviii. 980.</NOTE> enforced every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">act of power.

<P>Under his government the colony in Vir|ginia remained, with &s;ome &s;hort intervals of interruption, almo&s;t forty years, and to his mild and prudent admini&s;tration its increa&s;e and pro&s;perity is in a great mea&s;ure to be a&s;cribed. It was indebted, however, to the king him&s;elf for &s;uch a reform of its con|&s;titution and policy, as gave a different a&s;pect to the colony, and animated all its operations with new &s;pirit. Though the tenor of Sir William Berkeley's commi&s;&s;ion was the &s;ame with that of his predece&s;&s;or, he received in|&s;tructions under the great &s;eal, by which he was empowered to declare, that in all its con|cerns, civil as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tical, the colony was to be governed according to the laws of England; he was directed to i&s;&s;ue writs for electing repre&s;entatives of the people, who, in conjunction with the governor and council, were to form a general a&s;&s;embly, and to po&s;|&s;e&s;s &s;upreme legi&s;lative authority in the com|munity; he was ordered to e&s;tabli&s;h courts of ju&s;tice, in which all que&s;tions, whether civil or criminal, were to be decided agreeably to the forms of judicial procedure in the mother country. It is not ea&s;y to di&s;cover what were
<PB N="112" REF="036237_0109_1008A3A3D4769DF0">
the motives which induced a monarch tena|cious in adhering to any opinion or &s;y&s;tem which he had once adopted, jealous to exce&s;s of his own rights, and adver&s;e on every oc|ca&s;ion to any exten&s;ion of the privileges claim|ed by his people, to relinqui&s;h his original plan of admini&s;tration in the colony, and to grant &s;uch immunities to his &s;ubjects &s;ettled there. From the hi&s;torians of Virginia, no le&s;s &s;uper|ficial than ill-informed, no light can be deriv|ed with re&s;pect to this point. It is mo&s;t pro|bable, that dread of the &s;pirit then ri&s;ing in Great Britain extorted from Charles conce&s;&s;i|ons &s;o favourable to Virginia. After an inter|mi&s;&s;ion of almo&s;t twelve years, the &s;tate of his affairs compelled him to have recour&s;e to the great council of the nation. There his &s;ub|jects would find a juri&s;diction independent of the crown, and able to control its authority. There they hoped for legal redre&s;s of all their grievances. As the coloni&s;ts in Virginia had applied for relief to a former parliament, it might be expected with certainty, that they would lay their ca&s;e before the fir&s;t meeting of an a&s;&s;embly, in which they were &s;ecure of a favourable audience. Charles knew, that if the &s;pirit of his admini&s;tration in Virginia were to be tried by the maxims of the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution, it mu&s;t be &s;everely reprehended. He was aware that many mea&s;ures of greater mo|ment in his government would be brought

under a &s;trict review in parliament; and un|willing to give mal-contents the advantage of adding a charge of oppre&s;&s;ion in the remote parts of his dominions to a catalogue of do|me&s;tic grievances, he artfully endeavoured to take the merit of having granted voluntarily to his people in Virginia &s;uch privileges as he fore&s;aw would be extorted from him.</P>
<P>But though Charles e&s;tabli&s;hed the internal government of Virginia on a model &s;imilar to that of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and con|ferred on his &s;ubjects there all the rights of freemen and citizens, he was extremely &s;olici|tous to maintain its connection with the parent &s;tate. With this view he in&s;tructed Sir Wil|liam Berkeley &s;trictly to prohibit any com|merce of the colony with foreign nations; and in order more certainly to &s;ecure exclu&s;ive po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the advantages ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of its productions, he was required to take a bond from the ma&s;ter of each ve&s;&s;el that &s;ailed from Virginia, to land his cargo in &s;ome part of the king's dominions in Europe.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chalmers' Annals, p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">19. 232.</NOTE> Even under this re&s;traint, &s;uch is the kindly influence of free government on &s;ociety, the colony advanced &s;o rapidly in indu&s;try and po|pulation, that at the beginning of the civil war, the Engli&s;h &s;ettled in it exceeded twenty thou|&s;and.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 125<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE></P>

Even after monarchy was aboli&s;hed, after one king had been beheaded, and another driven into exile, the authority of the crown continued to be ac|knowledged (1650) and revered in Virginia.

<P>By the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive regulations, the plan of &s;ecuring to England a monopoly of the com|merce with its colonies, and of &s;hutting up every other channel into which it might be diverted, was perfected and reduced into com|plete &s;y&s;tem. On one &s;ide of the Atlantic, the&s;e regulations have been extolled as an ex|traordinary effort of political &s;agacity, and have been con&s;idered as the great charter of national commerce, to which the pre&s;ent &s;tate is in|debted for all its opulence and power. On the other, they have been execrated as a code of oppre&s;&s;ion, more &s;uited to the illiberality of mercantile ideas, than to exten&s;ive views of legi&s;lative wi&s;dom. Which of the&s;e opinions is be&s;t founded, I &s;hall examine at large in another part of this work.

perpetual exertion, on the part of the mother-country, to enforce and extend them; and on the part of the colonies, endeavours no le&s;s unremitting, to elude or to ob&s;truct their ope|ration.</P>
<P>Hardly was the act of navigation known in Virginia, and its effects begun to be felt, when the colony remon&s;trated again&s;t it as a griev|ance, and petitioned earne&s;tly for relief. But the commercial ideas of Charles and his mini|&s;ters coincided &s;o perfectly with tho&s;e of parli|ament, that, in&s;tead of li&s;tening with a fa|vourable ear to their applications, they labour|ed a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to carry the act into &s;trict execu|tion. For this purpo&s;e, in&s;tructions were i&s;|&s;ued to the governor, forts were built on the banks of the principal rivers, and &s;mall ve&s;&s;els appointed to cruize on the coa&s;t. The Virgi|nians, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of obtaining exemp|tion from the act, &s;et them&s;elves to evade it, and found means, notwith&s;tanding the vigi|lance with which they were watched, of car|rying on a con&s;iderable clande&s;tine trade with foreigners, particularly with the Dutch &s;ettled on Hud&s;on's River. Emboldened by ob&s;erv|ing di&s;affection &s;pread through the colony, &s;ome veteran &s;oldiers who had &s;erved under Crom|well, and had been bani&s;hed to Virginia, (1663) formed a de&s;ign of rendering them&s;elves ma&s;|ters of the country, and of a&s;&s;erting its inde|pendence

on England. This ra&s;h project was di&s;covered by one of their a&s;&s;ociates, and di&s;|concerted by the vigorous exertions of Sir William Berkeley. But the &s;pirit of di&s;con|tent, though repre&s;&s;ed was not extingui&s;hed. Every day &s;omething occurred to revive and to nouri&s;h it. As it is with extreme difficulty that commerce can be turned into a new chan|nel, tobacco, the &s;taple of the colony, &s;unk prodigiou&s;ly in value, when they were com|pelled to &s;end it all to one market. It was &s;ome time before England could furni&s;h them regularly full a&s;&s;ortments of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary ar|ticles, without which the indu&s;try of the co|lony could not be carried on, or its pro&s;perity &s;ecured. Encouraged by the &s;ymptoms of ge|neral languor and de&s;pondency, which this de|clining &s;tate of the colony occa&s;ioned, the In|dians &s;eated towards the heads of the rivers ventured fir&s;t to attack the remote &s;ettlements, and then to make incur&s;ions into the interior parts of the country. Unexpected as the&s;e ho&s;tilities were, from a people who during a long period had lived in friend&s;hip with the Engli&s;h, a mea&s;ure taken by the king &s;eems to have excited &s;till greater terror among the mo&s;t opulent people in the colony. Charles had imprudently imitated the example of his fa|ther, by granting &s;uch large tracts of land in Virginia to &s;everal of his courtiers, as tended to un&s;ettle the di&s;tribution of property in the

<P>Such a leader they found in Nathaniel Ba|con, a colonel of militia, who, though he had been &s;ettled in Virginia only three years, had acquired, by popular manners, an in&s;inu|ating addre&s;s, and the con&s;ideration derived from having been regularly trained in England to the profe&s;&s;ion of law, &s;uch general e&s;teem, that he had been admitted into the council, and was regarded as one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons in the colony. Bacon was ambitious, eloquent, daring, and prompted either by ho|ne&s;t zeal to redre&s;s the public wrongs, or al|lured by hopes of rai&s;ing him&s;elf to di&s;tinction and power, he mingled with the mal-contents, and by his bold harangues and confident pro|mi&s;es of removing all their grievances, he in|flamed them almo&s;t to madne&s;s. As the de|va&s;tations committed by the Indians was the
<PB N="125" REF="036237_0122_1008A3C897E36310">
calamity mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt by the people, he accu&s;ed the governor of having neglected the proper mea&s;ures for repelling the inva&s;ions of the &s;avages, and exhorted them to take arms in their own defence, and to exterminate that odious race. Great numbers a&s;&s;embled, and cho&s;e Bacon to be their general. He applied to the governor for a commi&s;&s;ion, confirming this election of the people, and offered to march in&s;tantly again&s;t the common enemy. Berkeley, accu&s;tomed by long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;u|preme command to high ideas of the re&s;pect due to his &s;tation, con&s;idered this tumultuary armament as an open in&s;ult to his authority, and &s;u&s;pected that, under &s;pecious appearances, Bacon concealed mo&s;t dangerous de&s;igns. Un|willing, however, to give farther provocation to an incen&s;ed multitude, by a direct refu&s;al of what they demanded, he thought it prudent to negociate, in order to gain time; and it was not until he found all endeavours to &s;ooth them ineffectual, that he i&s;&s;ued a proclama|tion, requiring them, in the king's name, under the pain of being denounced rebels, to di&s;per&s;e.</P>
<P>But Bacon, &s;en&s;ible that he had now advan|ced &s;o far as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to recede with honour or &s;afety, in&s;tantly took the only re&s;olution that remained in his &s;ituation. At the head of a cho&s;en body of his followers
<PB N="126" REF="036237_0123_1008A3CAEF107258">
he marched rapidly to James-Town, and &s;ur|rounding the hou&s;e where the governor and council were a&s;&s;embled, demanded the com|mi&s;&s;ion for which he had formerly applied. Berkeley, with the proud indignant &s;pirit of a cavalier, di&s;daining the requi&s;itions of a rebel, peremptorily refu&s;ed to comply, and calmly pre&s;ented his naked brea&s;t to the weapons which were pointed again&s;t it. The council, however, fore&s;eeing the fatal con&s;equences of driving an enraged multitude, in who&s;e pow|er they were, to the la&s;t extremities of vio|lence, prepared a commi&s;&s;ion, con&s;tituting Ba|con general of all the forces in Virginia, and by their entreaties prevailed on the governor to &s;ign it. Bacon with his troops retired in tri|umph. Hardly was the council delivered by his departure from the dread of pre&s;ent danger, when, by a tran&s;ition not unu&s;ual in feeble minds, pre&s;umptuous boldne&s;s &s;ucceeded to exce&s;&s;ive fear. The commi&s;&s;ion granted to Bacon was declared to be null, having been extorted by force; he was proclaimed a rebel, his followers were required to abandon his &s;tandard, and the militia ordered to arm and to join the governor.</P>
<P>Enraged at conduct which he branded with the name of ba&s;e and treacherous, Bacon, in|&s;tead of continuing his march towards the In|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> country, in&s;tantly wheeled about, and ad|vanced
<PB N="127" REF="036237_0124_1008A3CE74373FA0">
with all his forces to James-Town. The governor, unable to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch a nume|rous body, made his e&s;cape, and fled acro&s;s the bay to Acomack on the Ea&s;tern &s;hore. Some of the coun&s;ellors accompanied him thi|ther, others retired to their own plantations. Upon the flight of Sir William Berkeley, and di&s;per&s;ion of the council, the frame of civil government in the colony &s;eemed to be di&s;&s;ol|ved, and Bacon became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;upreme and uncontrolled power. But as he was &s;en&s;ible that his countrymen would not long &s;ubmit with patience to authority acquired and held merely by force of arms, he endeavoured to found it on a more con&s;titutional ba&s;is, by ob|taining the &s;anction of the people's approba|tion. With this view he called together the mo&s;t con&s;iderable gentlemen in the colony, and having prevailed on them to bind them&s;elves by oath to maintain his authority, and to re&s;i&s;t every enemy that &s;hould oppo&s;e it, he from that time con&s;idered his juri&s;diction as legally e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Berkeley, meanwhile, having collected &s;ome forces, made inroads into different parts of the colony, where Bacon's authority was recog|nized. Several &s;harp conflicts happened with various &s;ucce&s;s. James-Town was reduced to a&s;hes, and the be&s;t cultivated di&s;tricts in the province were laid wa&s;te&punc; &s;ometimes by one
<PB N="128" REF="036237_0125_1008A3D00B7764F0">
party, and &s;ometimes by the other. But it was not by his own exertions that the gover|nor hoped to terminate the conte&s;t. He had early tran&s;mitted an account of the tran&s;actions in Virginia to the king, and demanded &s;uch a body of &s;oldiers as would enable him to quell the in&s;urgents, whom he repre&s;ented as &s;o ex|a&s;perated by the re&s;traints impo&s;ed on their trade, that they were impatient to &s;hake of all dependance on the parent &s;tate. Charles, alarm|ed at a commotion no le&s;s dangerous than un|expected, and &s;olicitous to maintain his autho|rity over a colony, the value of which was daily increa&s;ing, and more fully under&s;tood, &s;peedily di&s;patched a &s;mall &s;quadron, with &s;uch a number of regular troops as Berkeley had required. Bacon and his followers receiv|ed information of this armament, but were not intimidated at its approach. They boldly determined to oppo&s;e it with open force, and declared it to be con&s;i&s;tent with their duty and allegiance, to treat all who &s;hould aid Sir William Berkeley as enemies, until they &s;hould have an opportunity of laying their grievances before their &s;overeign.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beverley's Hi&s;t. p. 75, 76.</NOTE></P>
<P>But while both parties prepared, (1677) with equal animo&s;ity, to involve their country in the horrors of civil war, an event happened,
<PB N="129" REF="036237_0126_1008A3D2A892FA68">
which quieted the commotion almo&s;t as &s;ud|denly as it had been excited. Bacon, when ready to take the field, &s;ickened and died. None of his followers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch talents, or were &s;o much objects of the people's confi|dence, as entitled them to a&s;pire to the &s;upreme command. De&s;titute of a leader to conduct and animate them, their &s;anguine hopes of &s;uc|ce&s;s &s;ub&s;ided; mutual di&s;tru&s;t accompanied this univer&s;al de&s;pondency; all began to wi&s;h for an accommodation; and after a &s;hort negociation with Sir William Berkeley, they laid down their arms, and &s;ubmitted to his government, on obtaining a promi&s;e of general pardon.</P>
<P>Thus terminated an in&s;urrection, which, in the annals of Virginia, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Bacon's rebellion.</HI> During &s;even months this daring leader was ma&s;ter of the colony, while the royal governor was &s;hut up in a re|mote and ill-peopled corner of it. What were the real motives that prompted him to take arms, and to what length he intended to carry his plans of reformation, either in commerce or government, it is not ea&s;y to di&s;cover, in the &s;canty materials from which we derive our infor|mation with re&s;pect to this tran&s;action. It is probable, that his conduct, like that of other adventurers in faction, would have been regula|ted chiefly by events; and accordingly as the&s;e proved favourable or adver&s;e, his views and
<PB N="130" REF="036237_0127_1008A3D59320AEC8">
requi&s;itions would have been extended or cir|cum&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Sir William Berkeley, as &s;oon as he was re|in&s;tated in his office, called together the repre|&s;entatives of the people, that by their advice and authority public tranquillity and order might be perfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed. Though this a&s;&s;embly met a few weeks after the death of Bacon, while the memory of reciprocal injuries was &s;till recent, and when the pa&s;&s;ions excited by &s;uch a fierce conte&s;t had but little time to &s;ub&s;ide, its proceedings were conducted with a moderation &s;eldom exerci&s;ed by the &s;ucce&s;sful party in a civil war. No man &s;uffered capi|tally; a &s;mall number were &s;ubjected to fines; others were declared incapable of holding any office of tru&s;t; and with tho&s;e exceptions, the promi&s;e of general indemnity was confirmed by law. Soon after, Berkeley was recalled, and Colonel Jefferys was appointed his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>From that period, to the Revolution in 1688, there is &s;carcely any memorable occur|rence in the hi&s;tory of Virginia. A peace was concluded with the Indians. Under &s;e|veral &s;ucce&s;&s;ive governors, admini&s;tration was carried on in the colony with the &s;ame arbi|trary &s;pirit that di&s;tingui&s;hed the latter years of Charles II. and the precipitate coun&s;els of

James II. The Virginians, with a con&s;titu|tion which, in form, re&s;embled that of Eng|land, enjoyed hardly any portion of the liberty which that admirable &s;y&s;tem of policy is framed to &s;ecure. They were deprived even of the la&s;t con&s;olation of the oppre&s;&s;ed, the power of complaining, by a law which, under &s;evere penalties, prohibited them from &s;peaking di&s;|re&s;pectfully of the governor, or defaming, ei|ther by words or writing, the admini&s;tration of the colony.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beverley, p. 81.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF AMERICA. BOOK X.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN James I. in the year one thou|&s;and &s;ix-hundred and &s;ix, made that magnificent partition, which has been men|tioned, of a va&s;t region in North America, ex|tending from the thirty-fourth to the forty-fifth degree of latitude, between two trading companies of his &s;ubjects, he e&s;tabli&s;hed the re&s;idence of the one in London, and of the other in Plymouth. The former was autho|rized to &s;ettle in the &s;outhern, and the latter in the northern part of this territory, then di&s;tingui&s;hed by the general name of Virginia. This arrangement &s;eems to have been formed upon the idea of &s;ome &s;peculative refiner, who
<PB N="134" REF="036237_0130_1008A3DDAAD95C40">
aimed at diffu&s;ing the &s;pirit of indu&s;try, by fix|ing the &s;eat of one branch of the trade that was now to be opened, on the ea&s;t coa&s;t of the i&s;land, and the other on the we&s;t. But Lon|don po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch advantages of &s;ituation, that the commercial wealth and activity of England have always centered in the capital. At the beginning of the la&s;t century, the &s;uperiority of the metropolis in both the&s;e re&s;pects was &s;o great, that though the powers and privileges conferred by the king on the two trading com|panies were preci&s;ely the &s;ame, the adventu|rers &s;ettled in Plymouth &s;ell far &s;hort of tho&s;e in London, in the vigour and &s;ucce&s;s of their efforts towards accompli&s;hing the purpo&s;e of their in&s;titution. Though the operations of the Plymouth company were animated by the public-&s;pirited zeal of Sir John Popham, chief ju&s;tice of England, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and &s;ome other gentlemen of the we&s;t, all its exertions were feeble and un|fortunate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el fitted out by the company (1606) was taken by the Spaniards. In the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;even, a feeble &s;ettlement was made at Sagahadoc; but, on account of the rigour of the climate, was &s;oon relinqui&s;hed, and for &s;ome time nothing farther was attempted than a few fi&s;hing voy|ages to Cape Cod, or a pitiful traffic with the

natives for &s;kins and oil. One of the ve&s;&s;els equipped for this purpo&s;e was commanded by Captain Smith, who&s;e name has been &s;o often mentioned with di&s;tinction in the hi&s;tory of Virginia. The adventure was pro&s;perous and lucrative (1614.) But his ardent enterpri&s;ing mind could not confine its attention to objects &s;o unequal to it as the petty details of a trading voyage. He employed a part of his time in exploring the coa&s;t, and in delineating its bays and harbours. On his return, he laid a map of it before Prince Charles, and, with the u&s;ual exaggeration of di&s;coverers, painted the beauty and excellence of the country in &s;uch glowing colours, that the young Prince, in the warmth of admiration, declared, that it &s;hould be called New England;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's Travels, Book vi. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &amp;c.

But what mere attention to private emolument or to na|tional utility could not effect, was accompli&s;h|ed by the operation of an higher principle.

As the various &s;et|tlements in New England are indebted for their origin to this &s;pirit, as in the cour&s;e of our narrative we &s;hall di&s;cern its influence mingling in all their tran&s;actions, and giving a peculiar tincture to the character of the people, as well as to their in&s;titutions, both civil and eccle&s;i|a&s;tical, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to trace its ri&s;e and progre&s;s with attention and accuracy.</P>

as degree of their &s;eparation was various. Wherever reformation was &s;udden, and carried on by the people without authority from their rulers, or in oppo&s;ition to it, the rupture was violent and total. Every part of the ancient fabric was overturned, and a different &s;y&s;tem, not only with re&s;pect to doctrine, but to church government, and the external rites of wor&s;hip, was e&s;tabli&s;hed. Calvin, who, by his abilities, learning, and au&s;terity of manners, had acquir|ed high reputation and authority in the Pro|te&s;tant churches, was a zealous advocate for this plan of thorough reformation. He exhi|bited a model of that pure form of eccle&s;ia&s;|tical policy, which he approved in the con&s;ti|tution of the church of Geneva. The &s;impli|city of its in&s;titutions, and &s;till more their re|pugnancy to tho&s;e of the Popi&s;h church, were &s;o much admired by all the &s;tricter reformers, that it was copied, with &s;ome &s;mall variations, in Scotland, in the Republic of the United Provinces, in the dominions of the Hou&s;e of Brandenburgh, in tho&s;e of the Elector Pala|tine, and in the churches of the Hugonots in France.</P>
<P>But in tho&s;e countries where the &s;teps of departure from the church of Rome were tak|en with greater deliberation, and regulated by the wi&s;dom or policy of the &s;upreme magi&s;|trate, the &s;eparation was not &s;o wide. Of all

the reformed churches, that of England has deviated lea&s;t from the ancient in&s;titutions. The violent but capricious &s;pirit of Henry VIII. who, though he di&s;claimed the &s;upre|macy, revered the tenets of the Papal &s;ee, checked innovations in doctrine or wor&s;hip during his reign. When his &s;on a&s;cended the throne, and the Prote&s;tant religion was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by law, the cautious prudence of Arch|bi&s;hop Cranmer moderated the zeal of tho&s;e who had e&s;pou&s;ed the new opinions. Though the articles to be recognized as the &s;y&s;tem of national faith, were framed conformably to the doctrines of Calvin, his notions with re&s;pect to church government and the mode of wor&s;hip were not adopted. As the hierarchy in Eng|land was incorporated with the civil policy of the kingdom, and con&s;tituted a member of the legi&s;lature, archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops, with all the &s;ubordinate ranks of eccle&s;ia&s;tics &s;ubject to them, were continued according to ancient form, and with the &s;ame dignity and juri&s;|diction. The peculiar ve&s;tments in which the clergy performed their &s;acred functions, bow|ing at the name of Je&s;us, kneeling at receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s in bapti&s;m, the u&s;e of the Ring in marriage, with &s;everal other rites to which long u&s;age had accu&s;tomed the people, and which time had rendered venerable, were &s;till retained. But though Parliament enjoined the

<P>On the acce&s;&s;ion of Mary, the furious zeal with which &s;he per&s;ecuted all who had adopt|ed the tenets of the Reformers forced many eminent Prote&s;tants, laymen as well as eccle|&s;ia&s;tics, to &s;eek an a&s;ylum on the continent. Francfort, Geneva, Ba&s;il, and Stra&s;burgh, re|ceived them with affectionate ho&s;pitality as &s;uf|ferers in the cau&s;e of truth, and the magi&s;trates permitted them to a&s;&s;emble by them&s;elves for religious wor&s;hip. The exiles who took up their re&s;idence in the two former cities mo|delled their little congregations according to the ideas of Calvin, and, with a &s;pirit natural to men in their &s;ituation, eagerly adopted in&s;ti|tutions which appeared to be farther removed from the &s;uper&s;titions of Popery than tho&s;e of their own church. They returned to England as &s;oon as Elizabeth re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the Prote&s;tant religion, not only with more violent antipathy to the opinions and practices of that church

which religion was defiled in their own church. In vain did the defenders of the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem repre&s;ent that the&s;e forms and ceremo|nies were, in them&s;elves, things perfectly in|different, which, from long u&s;age, were view|ed with reverence; and, by their impre&s;&s;ion upon the &s;en&s;es and imagination, tended not only to fix the attention, but to affect the heart, and to warm it with devout and worthy &s;enti|ments. The Puritans (for by that name &s;uch as &s;crupled to comply with what was enjoined by the act of uniformity were di&s;tingui&s;hed) main|tained, that the rites in que&s;tion were inven|tions of men, &s;uperadded to the &s;imple and rea&s;onable &s;ervice required in the word of God; that from the exce&s;&s;ive &s;olicitude with which conformity to them was exacted, the multitude mu&s;t conceive &s;uch an high opinion of their value and importance, as might induce them to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the mere form and &s;hadow of religion, and to imagine that external ob&s;er|vances may compen&s;ate for the want of inward &s;anctity; that ceremonies which had been long employed by a &s;ociety manife&s;tly corrupt, to veil its own defects, and to &s;educe and fa&s;cinate mankind, ought now to be rejected as relics of &s;uper&s;tition unworthy of a place in a church which gloried in the name of <HI>Reformed.</HI></P>

to the arguments of the contending parties; and it is obvious to which of them, men who had lately beheld the &s;uper&s;titious &s;pirit of Po|pery, and felt its per&s;ecuting rage, would lend the mo&s;t favourable ear. The de&s;ire of a far|ther &s;eparation from the church of Rome &s;pread wide through the nation. The preach|ers who contended for this, and who refu&s;ed to wear the &s;urplice, and other ve&s;tments pe|culiar to their order, or to ob&s;erve the ceremo|nies enjoined by law, were followed and ad|mired, while the mini&s;try of the zealous ad|vocates for conformity was de&s;erted, and their per&s;ons often expo&s;ed to in&s;ult. For &s;ome time the non-conformi&s;ts were connived at; but as their number and boldne&s;s increa&s;ed, the interpo&s;ition both of &s;piritual and civil autho|rity was deemed nece&s;&s;ary in order to check their progre&s;s. To the di&s;grace of Chri&s;tians, the &s;acred rights of con&s;cience and private judg|ment, as well as the charity and mutual for|bearance &s;uitable to the mild &s;pirit of the reli|gion which they profe&s;&s;ed, were in that age little under&s;tood. Not only the idea of tole|ration, but even the word it&s;elf in the &s;en&s;e now affixed to it, was then unknown. Every church claimed a right to employ the hand of power for the protection of truth and the ex|tirpation of error. The laws of her kingdom armed Elizabeth with ample authority for this purpo&s;e, and &s;he was abundantly di&s;po&s;ed to
<PB N="144" REF="036237_0140_1008A3F661782938">
exerci&s;e it with full vigour. Many of the mo&s;t eminent among the Puritan clergy were deprived of their benefices, others were im|pri&s;oned, &s;everal were fined, and &s;ome put to death. But per&s;ecution, as u&s;ually happens, in&s;tead of extingui&s;hing, inflamed their zeal to &s;uch a height, that the juri&s;diction of the ordinary courts of law was deemed in&s;ufficient to &s;uppre&s;s it, and a new tribunal was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed under the title of the <HI>high commi&s;&s;ion for eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs,</HI> who&s;e powers and mode of procedure were hardly le&s;s odious or le&s;s ho&s;tile to the principles of ju&s;tice, than tho&s;e of the Spani&s;h inqui&s;ition. Several attempts were made in the Hou&s;e of Commons to check the&s;e arbitrary proceedings, and to mo|derate the rage of per&s;ecution; but the Queen always impo&s;ed &s;ilence upon tho&s;e who pre|&s;umed to deliver any opinion with re&s;pect to a matter appertaining &s;olely to her prerogative, in a tone as imperious and arrogant as was ever u&s;ed by Henry VIII. in addre&s;&s;ing his Parlia|ments; and &s;o tamely ob&s;equious were the guardians of the people's rights, that they not only obeyed tho&s;e uncon&s;titutional commands, but con&s;ented to an act, by which every per|&s;on who &s;hould ab&s;ent him&s;elf from church during a month was &s;ubjected to puni&s;hment by fine and impri&s;onment; and if after con|viction he did not, within three months, re|nounce his erroneous opinions, and conform to

<P>By this iniquitous &s;tatute, equally repug|nant to ideas of civil and of religious liberty, the Puritans were cut off from any hope of obtaining either reformation in the church or indulgence to them&s;elves. Exa&s;perated by this rigorous treatment, their antipathy to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed religion increa&s;ed, and, with the pro|gre&s;s natural to violent pa&s;&s;ions, carried them far beyond what was their original aim. The fir&s;t Puritans did not entertain any &s;cruples with re&s;pect to the lawfulne&s;s of Epi&s;copal go|vernment, and &s;eem to have been very unwill|ing to withdraw from communion with the church of which they were members. But when they were thrown out of her bo&s;om, and con&s;trained to hold &s;eparate a&s;&s;emblies for the wor&s;hip of God, their followers no longer viewed a &s;ociety by which they were oppre&s;&s;|ed with reverence or affection. Her govern|ment, her di&s;cipline, her ritual, were examin|ed with minute attention. Every error was pointed out, and every defect magnified. The more boldly any teacher inveighed again&s;t the corruptions of the church, he was li&s;tened to with greater approbation; and the farther he

urged his di&s;ciples to depart from &s;uch an im|pure community, the more eagerly did they follow him. By degrees, ideas of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal policy, altogether repugnant to tho&s;e of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, gained footing in the na|tion. The more &s;ober and learned Puritans inclined to that form which is known by the name of Pre&s;byterian. Such as were more thoroughly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;pirit of innova|tion, however much they might approve the equality of pa&s;tors which that &s;y&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;hes, reprobated the authority which it ve&s;ts in va|rious judicatories, de&s;cending from one to ano|ther in regular &s;ubordination, as incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tian liberty.</P>
<P>The&s;e wild notions floated for &s;ome time in the minds of the people, and amu&s;ed them with many ideal &s;chemes of eccle&s;ia&s;tical policy. At length Robert Brown, (1580) a popular de|claimer in high e&s;timation, reduced them to a &s;y&s;tem, on which he modelled his own con|gregation. He taught, that the church of England was corrupt and antichri&s;tian, its mini&s;ters not lawfully ordained, its ordinances and &s;acraments invalid; and therefore he pro|hibited his people to hold communion with it in any religious function. He maintained, that a &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians, uniting together to wor&s;hip God, con&s;tituted a church, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of complete juri&s;diction in the conduct of its
<PB N="145" REF="036237_0143_1008A3FE7815A698">
own affairs, independent of any other &s;ociety, and unaccountable to any &s;uperior; that the prie&s;thood was neither a di&s;tinct order in the church, nor conferred an indelible character; but that every man qualified to teach might be &s;et apart for that office by the election of the brethren, and by impo&s;ition of their hands; in like manner, by their authority, he might be di&s;charged from that function, and reduced to the rank of a private Chri&s;tian; that every per&s;on when admitted a member of a church ought to make a public confe&s;&s;ion of his faith, and give evidence of his being in a &s;tate of favour with God; and that all the affairs of a church were to be regulated by the deci&s;ion of the majority of its members.</P>
<P>This democratical form of government, which aboli&s;hed all di&s;tinction of ranks in the church, and conferred an equal portion of pow|er on every individual, accorded &s;o perfectly with the levelling genius of fanatici&s;m, that it was fondly adopted by many as a complete model of Chri&s;tian policy. From their foun|der, they were denominated Browni&s;ts; and as their tenets were more ho&s;tile to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed religion than tho&s;e of other &s;eparati&s;ts, the fierce&s;t &s;torm of per&s;ecution fell upon their heads. Many of them were fined or impri|&s;oned, and &s;ome put to death; and though Brown, with a levity of which there are few

But as all their motions were care|fully watched, both by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil courts, which, as often as they were detected, puni&s;hed them with the utmo&s;t ri|gour, a body of them, weary of living in a &s;tate of continual danger and alarm, fled to Holland, and &s;ettled in Leyden, under the care of Mr. John Robin&s;on, their pa&s;tor. There they re&s;ided for &s;everal years unmole&s;ted and ob&s;cure. But many of their aged mem|bers dying, and &s;ome of the younger marry|ing into Dutch families, while their church received no increa&s;e, either by recruits from England, or by pro&s;elytes gained in the coun|try, they began to be afraid, that all their high attainments in &s;piritual knowledge would be lo&s;t, and that perfect fabric of policy, which they had erected, would be di&s;&s;olved and con|&s;igned to oblivion, if they remained longer in a &s;trange land.</P>

The dangers and hard&s;hips to which all former emigrants to America had deen expo&s;ed, did not deter them.

<P>After the utmo&s;t efforts, their preparations fell far &s;hort of what was requi&s;ite for begin|ning the &s;ettlement of a new colony.

The place of their de&s;tination was Hud&s;on's River, where they intended to &s;ettle; but their captain having been bribed, as is &s;aid, by the Dutch, who had then form|ed a &s;cheme which they afterwards accom|pli&s;hed, of planting a colony there, carried them &s;o far towards the north, that the fir&s;t land in America which they made was Cape-Cod.

<P>No &s;ea&s;on could be more unfavourable to &s;ettlement than that in which the colony landed.

amid&s;t all their dangers and hard&s;hips. The con&s;titution of their church was the &s;ame with that which they had e&s;tabli&s;hed in Hol|land.

<P>But whatever were the intentions of the king (1629) the adventurers kept their own object &s;teadily in view. Soon after their pow|ers to e&s;tabli&s;h a colony were rendered com|plete by the royal charter, they fitted out five &s;hips for New England; on board of which embarked upwards of three hundred pa&s;&s;engers, with a view of &s;ettling there.

of emigrants, who had left England the pre|ceding year, under the conduct of Endicott, a deep enthu&s;ia&s;t, whom, prior to their incorpo|ration by the royal charter, the a&s;&s;ociates had appointed deputy governor. They were &s;ettled at a place called by the Indians Naunekeag, and to which Endicott, with the fond affectation of fanatics of that age to employ the language and appellations of &s;cripture in the affairs of com|mon life, had given the name of Salem.</P>
<P>The emigrants under Endicott, and &s;uch as now joined them, coincided perfectly in reli|gious principles. They were Puritans of the &s;tricte&s;t form; and to men of this character the in&s;titution of a church was naturally of &s;uch intere&s;ting concern as to take place of every other object.

Without regard to the &s;entiments of that monarch under the &s;anc|tion of who&s;e authority they &s;ettled in America, and from whom they derived right to act as a body politic, and in contempt of the laws of England, with which the charter required that none of their acts or ordinances &s;hould be incon&s;i&s;tent, they adopted in their infant church that form of policy which has &s;ince been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of Independent. They united together (Augu&s;t 6) in religious &s;ociety, by a &s;olemn covenant with God, and with

They elected a pa&s;tor, a teacher, and an elder, whom they &s;et apart for their re&s;pective offices, by im|po&s;ition of the hands of the brethren. All who were that day admitted members of the church, &s;ignified their a&s;&s;ent to a confe&s;&s;ion of faith drawn up by their teacher, and gave an account of the foundation of their own hopes as Chri&s;tians; and it was declared, that no per&s;on &s;hould hereafter be received into com|munion until he gave &s;atisfaction to the church with re&s;pect to his faith and &s;anctity.

As by their de|termination the political condition of every ci|tizen was fixed, all paid court to men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an important power, by a&s;&s;uming tho&s;e au&s;tere and &s;anctimonious manners which were known to be the mo&s;t certain recommendation to their favour. In con&s;equence of this a&s;cen|dant, which was acquired chiefly by the wilde&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;ts among the clergy, their notions became a &s;tandard to which all &s;tudied to con|form, and the &s;ingularities characteri&s;tic of the Puritans in that age increa&s;ed, of which many remarkable in&s;tances will occur in the cour&s;e of our narrative.</P>

<P>As &s;everal of the vacant Indian &s;tations were well cho&s;en, &s;uch was the eagerne&s;s of the Engli&s;h to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, that their &s;ettlements became more numerous and more widely di&s;per&s;ed than &s;uited the condition of an infant colony. This led to an innovation which totally altered the nature and con&s;titu|tion of the government. When a general court was to be held in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty-four, the freemen, in|&s;tead of attending it in per&s;on as the charter pre|&s;cribed, elected repre&s;entatives in their different di&s;tricts, authorizing them to appear in their name, with full power to deliberate and decide concerning every point that fell under the cog|nizance
<PB N="170" REF="036237_0166_1008A43C9DCA01D0">
of the general court. Whether this mea&s;ure was &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome de&s;igning lea|ders, or whether they found it prudent to &s;ooth the people by complying with their in|clination, is uncertain. The repre&s;entatives were admitted; and con&s;idered them&s;elves, in conjunction with the governor and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, as the &s;upreme legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly of the co|lony. In a&s;&s;ertion of their own rights they enacted, that no law &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed, no tax &s;hould be impo&s;ed, and no public officer &s;hould be appointed, but in the general a&s;&s;embly. The pretexts for making this new arrangement were plau&s;ible. The number of freemen was great|ly increa&s;ed; many re&s;ided at a di&s;tance from the places where the &s;upreme courts were held; per&s;onal attendance became inconvenient; the form of government in their own country had rendered familiar the idea of delegating their rights, and committing the guardian&s;hip of their liberties, to repre&s;entatives of their own choice, and the experience of ages had taught them that this important tru&s;t might with &s;afety be lodged in their hands. Thus did the company of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, in le&s;s than &s;ix years from its incorporation by the king, mature and perfect a &s;cheme which, I have already ob&s;erved, &s;ome of its more artful and a&s;piring leaders &s;eem to have had in view when the a&s;&s;ociation for peopling New England was fir&s;t formed.

<P>But however liberal their &s;y&s;tem of civil po|licy might be, as their religious opinions were no longer under any re&s;traint of authority, the &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m continued to &s;pread, and became every day wilder and more extravagant. Williams, a mini&s;ter of Salem, in high e&s;ti|mation, having conceived an antipathy to the Cro&s;s of St. George in the &s;tandard of England, declaimed again&s;t it with &s;o much vehemence as a relic of &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry, which ought not to be retained among a people &s;o pure and &s;anctified, that Endicot, one of the mem|bers of the court of a&s;&s;i&s;tants, in a tran&s;port of zeal, publicly cut out the Cro&s;s from the en&s;ign di&s;played before the governor's gate.

<P>The pro&s;perous &s;tate of New England was now &s;o highly extolled, and the &s;imple frame of its eccle&s;ia&s;tic policy was &s;o much admired by all who&s;e affections were e&s;tranged from the church of England, that crowds of new &s;et|lers flocked thither (1635). Among the&s;e were two per&s;ons, who&s;e names have been rendered memorable by the appearance which they afterwards made on a more con&s;picuous theatre; one was Hugh Peters, the enthu&s;i|a&s;tic and intriguing chaplain of Oliver Crom|well; the other Mr. Henry Vane, &s;on of Sir Henry Vane, a privy coun&s;ellor, high in of|fice, and of great credit with the king; a young man of a noble family, animated with &s;uch zeal for pure religion and &s;uch love of liberty as induced him to relinqui&s;h all his hopes in England, and to &s;ettle in a colony hitherto no farther advanced in improvement than barely to afford &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to its members, was received

with the fonde&s;t admiration.

With univer&s;al con&s;ent, and high expectations of advantage from his admini&s;tration, he was elected gover|nor in the year (1636) &s;ub&s;equent to his ar|rival. But as the affairs of an infant colony afforded not objects adequate to the talents of Vane, his bu&s;y pragmatical &s;pirit occupied it|&s;elf with theological &s;ubtilties and &s;peculations unworthy of his attention. The&s;e were ex|cited by a woman, who&s;e reveries produced &s;uch effects, both within the colony and beyond its precincts, that, frivolous as they may now appear, they mu&s;t be mentioned as an occur|rence of importance in its hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>It was the cu&s;tom at that time in New Eng|land, among the chief men in every congrega|tion, to meet once a week, in order to repeat the &s;ermons which they had heard, and to hold religious conference with re&s;pect to the doctrine contained in them.

At fir&s;t &s;he &s;atisfied her&s;elf with repeating what &s;he could recollect of the di&s;cour&s;es delivered by their teachers. She began afterwards to add illu&s;trations, and at length proceeded to cen|&s;ure &s;ome of the clergy as un&s;ound, and to vent opinions and fancies of her own. The&s;e were all founded on the &s;y&s;tem which is deno|minated Antinomian by divines, and tinged with the deepe&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m. She taught, that &s;anctity of life is no evidence of ju&s;tifica|tion, or of a &s;tate of favour with God; and that &s;uch as inculcated the nece&s;&s;ity of mani|fe&s;ting the reality of our faith by obedience, preached only a covenant of works; &s;he con|tended that the &s;pirit of God dwelt per&s;onally in good men, and by inward revelations and impre&s;&s;ions they received the fulle&s;t di&s;coveries of the divine will. The fluency and confi|dence with which &s;he delivered the&s;e notions gained her many admirers and pro&s;elytes, not only among the vulgar, but among the princi|pal inhabitants. The whole colony was inte|re&s;ted and agitated. Vane, who&s;e &s;agacity and acutene&s;s &s;eemed to for&s;ake him whenever they were turned towards religion, e&s;pou&s;ed and de|fended her wilde&s;t tenets.

Several of her di&s;ci|ples withdrew from the province of their own accord.

<P>However much the&s;e theological conte&s;ts might di&s;quiet the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, they contributed to the more &s;peedy po|pulation of America. When Williams was bani&s;hed from Salem in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty-four, &s;uch was the at|tachment of his hearers to a pa&s;tor who&s;e piety they revered, that a good number of them vo|luntarily accompanied him in his exile.

i&s;land in Naragan&s;et Bay, which acquired the name of Rhode I&s;land. Williams remained among them upwards of forty years, re&s;pected as the father and the guide of the colony which he had planted. His &s;pirit differed from that of the Puritans in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; it was mild and tolerating; and having ventured him&s;elf to reject e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions, he endeavoured to &s;ecure the &s;ame liberty to other men, by main|taining, that the exerci&s;e of private judgment was a natural and &s;acred right; that the civil magi&s;trate has no compul&s;ive juri&s;diction in the concerns of religion; that the puni&s;hment of any per&s;on on account of his opinions, was an encroachment on con&s;cience, and an act of per&s;ecution.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neal's Hi&s;t. of N.

<P>The hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t attempts to people the provinces of New Hamp&s;hire and Main, which form the fourth and mo&s;t exten&s;ive di|vi&s;ion in New England, is ob&s;cure and per|plexed, by the interfering claims of various proprietors. The company of Plymouth had incon&s;iderately parcelled out the northern part of the territory contained in its grant among different per&s;ons: Of the&s;e only Sir Ferdinan|do Gorges and Captain Ma&s;on &s;eem to have had any &s;erious intention to occupy the lands allotted to them.

<P>By extending their &s;ettlements, the Engli&s;h became expo&s;ed to new danger. The tribes of Indians around Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay were feeble and unwarlike; yet from regard to ju&s;tice, as well as motives of prudence, the fir&s;t coloni&s;ts were &s;tudious to obtain the con&s;ent of the na|tives before they ventured to occupy any of their lands; and though in &s;uch tran&s;actions the con&s;ideration given was often very inade|quate to the value of the territory acquired, it was &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the demands of the proprietors. The Engli&s;h took quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands thus conveyed to them, and no open ho&s;tility broke out between them and the ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.

The Pequods were a formidable people, who could bring into the field a thou&s;and warriors, not infe|rior in courage to any in the New World. They fore&s;aw, not only that the extermination of the Indian race mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of permitting the Engli&s;h to &s;pread over the con|tinent of America, but that if mea&s;ures were not &s;peedily concerted to prevent it, the cala|mity would be unavoidable. With this view they applied to the Narragan&s;ets, reque&s;ting them to forget ancient animo&s;ities for a mo|ment, and to co-operate with them in expel|ing a common enemy who threatened both with de&s;truction. They repre&s;ented that, when tho&s;e &s;trangers fir&s;t landed, the object of their vi&s;it was not &s;u&s;pected, and no proper precau|tions were taken to check their progre&s;s; that now, by &s;ending out colonies in one year to|wards three different quarters, their intentions were manife&s;t, and the people of America mu&s;t abandon their native &s;eats to make way for unju&s;t intruders.</P>

They &s;urpri&s;ed &s;tragg]ers, and &s;calped them; they plundered and burnt remote &s;ettlements; they attacked Fort Say Brook without &s;ucce&s;s, though garri&s;oned only by twenty men; and when the Engli&s;h be|gan to act offen&s;ively, they retired to fa&s;tne&s;&s;es which they deemed inacce&s;&s;ible. The differ|ent colonies had agreed to unite again&s;t the common enemy, each furni&s;hing a quota of men in proportion to its numbers. The troops of Connecticut which lay mo&s;t expo&s;ed to danger were &s;oon a&s;&s;embled. The march of tho&s;e from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, which formed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable body, was retarded by the

mo&s;t &s;ingular cau&s;e that ever influenced the o|perations of a military force. When they were mu&s;tered previous to their departure, it was found that &s;ome of the officers, as well as of the private &s;oldiers, were &s;till under a covenant of works; and that the ble&s;&s;ing of God could not be implored or expected to crown the arms of &s;uch unhallowed men with &s;ucce&s;s. The alarm was general, and many arrangements nece&s;&s;ary in order to ca&s;t out the unclean, and to render this little band &s;uffici|ently pure to fight the battles of a people who entertained high ideas of their own &s;anctity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neal, i. 168</NOTE></P>
<P>Meanwhile the Connecticut troops, reinfor|ced by a &s;mall detachment from Say Brook, found it nece&s;&s;ary to advance towards the ene|my. They were po&s;ted on a ri&s;ing ground, in the middle of a &s;wamp towards the head of the river Mi&s;tick, which they had &s;urrounded with pali&s;adoes, the be&s;t defence that their &s;len|der &s;kill in the art of fortification had di&s;co|vered. Though they knew that the Engli&s;h were in motion, yet, with the u&s;ual improvi|dence and &s;ecurity of &s;avages, they took no mea&s;ures either to ob&s;erve their progre&s;s, or to guard again&s;t being &s;urpri&s;ed them&s;elves. The enemy (May 20) unperceived, reached the pali&s;adoes, and if a dog had not given the

alarm by barking, the Indians mu&s;t have been ma&s;&s;acred without re&s;i&s;tance. In a moment, however they &s;tarted to arms, and rai&s;ing the war-cry, prepared to repel the a&s;&s;ailants. But at that early period of their intercour&s;e with the Europeans, the Americans were little ac|quainted with the u&s;e of gunpowder, and dreaded its effects extremely. While &s;ome of the Engli&s;h galled them with an ince&s;&s;ant fire through the intervals between the pali&s;adoes, others forced their way by the entries into the fort, filled only with branches of trees; and &s;etting fire to the huts which were covered with reeds, the confu&s;ion and terror quickly became general. Many of the women and children peri&s;hed in the flames; and the war|riors, in endeavouring to e&s;cape, were either &s;lain by the Engli&s;h, or falling into the hands of their Indian allies, who &s;urrounded the fort at a di&s;tance, were re&s;erved for a more cruel fate. After the junction of the troops from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, the Engli&s;h re&s;olved to pur&s;ue their victory; and hunting the Indians from one place of retreat to another, &s;ome &s;ub&s;e|quent encounters were hardly le&s;s fatal to them than the action on the Mi&s;tick. In le&s;s than three months the tribe of Pequods was extir|pated: A few mi&s;erable fugitives who took re|fuge among the neighbouring Indians, being incorporated by them, lo&s;t their name as a di&s;|tinct people.

But they &s;tained their laurels by the u&s;e which they made of victory. In|&s;tead of treating the Pequods as an indepen|dent people, who made a gallant effort to de|fend the property, the rights, and the freedom of their nation, they retaliated upon them all the barbarities of American war. Some they ma&s;&s;acred in cold blood, others they gave up to be tortured by their Indian allies, a con&s;i|derable number they &s;old as &s;laves in Bermu|das, the re&s;t were reduced to &s;ervitude among them&s;elves.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hutchin&s;on, p. 58, 76, &amp;c.

The number of tho&s;e emigrants drew the attention of govern|ment, and appeared &s;o formidable, that a pro|clamation was i&s;&s;ued, prohibiting ma&s;ters of &s;hips from carrying pa&s;&s;engers to New Eng|land without &s;pecial permi&s;&s;ion. On many occa&s;ions this injunction was eluded or di&s;re|garded. Fatally for the king, it operated with full effect in one in&s;tance.

By order of council, an embargo was laid on the&s;e when on the point of &s;ailing; and Charles, far from &s;u&s;pecting that the future revolutions in his kingdoms were to be excited and directed by per&s;ons in &s;uch an humble &s;phere of life, forcibly detain|ed the men de&s;tined to overturn his throne, and to terminate his days by a violent death.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mather, Magnalia, b. i. ch. 5. p. 23.

The maxims of the Puritans with re&s;pect to the government both of church and &s;tate, became predominant in the nation, and were enforced by the hand of power. Their oppre&s;&s;ors were humbled; that perfect &s;y&s;tem of reformed polity, which had long been the object of their admiration and de&s;ire, was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by law; and amid&s;t the intrigues and conflicts of an ob&s;tinate civil war, turbu|lent and a&s;piring &s;pirits found &s;uch full occu|pation, that they had no inducement to quit a bu&s;y theatre, on which they had ri&s;en to act a mo&s;t con&s;picuous part.

For &s;ome years, even &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence was procured with difficulty; and it was towards the clo&s;e of the period to which our narrative is arrived, before the product of the &s;ettlement yielded the planters any return for their &s;tock.
