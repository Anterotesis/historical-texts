<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE generous Things You have been doing from Year to Year for <HI>my Coun|try;</HI> for many of the <HI>Churches of Chri&s;t</HI> in it, whom You have enrich'd with Means of <HI>&s;acred Knowledge</HI> and <HI>practi|cal Religion;</HI> and for the <HI>pious Poor</HI> in it, both <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Others,</HI> who have ta&s;ted of your Bounties and their Souls have ble&s;&s;ed You; have led me into this open Acknowledgment, to the Glory of God, from who&s;e Hands we would receive what You and Others have &s;ent us from Time to Time, <HI>an Odour of a &s;weet Smell, a Sacrifice acceptable, well plea&s;ing to God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="004002_0004_10037F06D69BAC88">
Sir, I hold my Self highly indebted to the Go|verning Providence of a gracious <HI>God,</HI> which led me in my Youth from my <HI>Native Land</HI> to &s;ee That of our <HI>Fathers Sepulchres;</HI> and in my Way thither was pleas'd to <HI>&s;trip</HI> me of the Little I had, that I might be invited by the excellent <HI>Saint</HI> your dear <HI>Mother,</HI> who <HI>took in the Stranger,</HI> and for a Cour&s;e of Years together regarded him as a <HI>Son,</HI> while her Soul longed after <HI>You</HI> at <HI>Riga.</HI></P>
<P>What the <HI>Holy God</HI> was then doing I could little know at the Time, but He has made me to per|ceive &s;ince, "That He led me into Mr. <HI>Parkhur&s;t</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and from thence to <HI>Bath,</HI> to bring me into a more immediate &amp; exten&s;ive Acquaintance with <HI>Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction for Learning and Religion,</HI> for my greater <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s</HI> in the Times that have pa&s;&s;ed over me, and to be <HI>the Hand</HI> thro' which his pur|po&s;ed Benefactions to our <HI>College,</HI> to many of our <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Churches,</HI> and to many poor <HI>Members of Chri&s;t</HI> in the&s;e Parts, &s;hould flow.</P>
<P>By the Help of God, I humbly hope that I have willingly done the Part of a <HI>faithful Almoner,</HI> as well in <HI>advi&s;ing</HI> when I have been writ to as in <HI>ob&s;erving the Directions</HI> of Tho&s;e who have intru&s;ted me; which is all the <HI>Honour</HI> I may pretend to in <HI>the Admini&s;tration of this Service, which is abundant by many Thank&s;givings to God;</HI> &s;ome of <HI>which</HI> You have &s;een and read, as from the Hand of worthy <HI>Mini|&s;ters,</HI> &s;o <HI>One</HI> e&s;pecially from the <HI>Angelick Pen of a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>Gerri&s;h</HI> of <HI>Cambridge.</HI></NOTE> Gentlewoman,</HI> who <HI>in the School of Affliction</HI> made a Proficiency in <HI>Grace</HI> and &s;acred <HI>Science,</HI> even beyond all that <HI>the School of the Prophets</HI> among us has been able to boa&s;t! and as &s;oon almo&s;t as <HI>She</HI> had wrote what I &s;ent You, lay down and <HI>died</HI> in perfect Peace.</P>

I know Sir You are no Stranger to <HI>the Profu&s;ion of Bounties</HI> which for a Cour&s;e of many Years our <HI>College</HI> received from the mo&s;t pious and munifi|cent <HI>Thomas Hollis,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who&s;e worthy <HI>Heir</HI> has &s;oon followed him to the Grave, after he had made a good <HI>Addition</HI> to the Foundations laid by his <HI>Uncle,</HI> and adorn'd us with a rare <HI>Orrery;</HI> and now we have the Tydings of the Death of <HI>John Hollis,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the worthy <HI>Brother</HI> of our great Benefactor, and a <HI>Heir</HI> with him of the &s;ame <HI>Grace;</HI> who was al&s;o a <HI>Father</HI> to poor <HI>Orphans</HI> here, as well as at Home.</P>
<P>And if it were permitted me, I would now have named <HI>Another,</HI> a younger <HI>Gentleman,</HI> whom God has <HI>inrich'd with all Bountifulne&s;s</HI> us-ward; of who&s;e Liberality our <HI>Churches</HI> and our <HI>Poor</HI> have hereto|fore largely ta&s;ted; and this Year brings me the Joy of an <HI>Order</HI> from him for &s;chooling, cloathing, feeding and lodging of <HI>twenty Indian Children</HI> at <HI>Ho&s;&s;atonnoc,</HI> a <HI>Tribe</HI> who have lately received the Go&s;pel with a marvelous Joy, and are now under the <HI>Pa&s;toral Care</HI> of the Reverend and Learned Mr. <HI>John Sargent.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WHEN the following <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> was preach'd to <HI>You,</HI> a part of it at the <HI>public Lecture,</HI> and a part in your more <HI>private Meeting,</HI> You were then ad|dre&s;s'd in the <HI>Clo&s;e</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Sermons</HI> in the following <HI>Words,</HI> which I think good <HI>now</HI> to bring to your <HI>Remembrance,</HI> and al&s;o to lay before Others.</P>
<Q><P>I &s;peak unto a <HI>Trading Town,</HI> and I thank God unto a <HI>People</HI> us'd to <HI>Charities</HI> and <HI>liberal Things.</HI> Need I provoke you to <HI>Emulation</HI> by what is
<PB N="ii" REF="004002_0008_10037F2263D92F60">written of the Men of <HI>Tyre?</HI> And God forbid that <HI>they</HI> &s;hould <HI>ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t Us, and condemn us.</HI> Shall not <HI>your</HI> Merchandize and <HI>your</HI> Hire be <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord,</HI> when <HI>theirs</HI> was &s;o, when the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> came among them! Surely <HI>we</HI> have carried <HI>our Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> as high, and <HI>our Ob|ligations</HI> are at lea&s;t as great as Tho&s;e of <HI>Tyre and Sidon.</HI></P>
<P>One <HI>natural Benefit</HI> of Trade and Commerce to any People is, that it <HI>enlarges their Hearts to do generous Things.</HI> God grant that every Thing of that Nature done among us or <HI>by O|thers for us,</HI> may be &s;o done as to carry in their <HI>Front</HI> the glorious <HI>In&s;cription</HI> of HOLINESS TO GOD. So let it be in your <HI>&s;ecret Gifts</HI> and Di&s;|tributions, &s;o in your private and more bounti|ful <HI>Sub&s;criptions and Collections,</HI> whether they be for God's <HI>Poor</HI> or for his <HI>Wor&s;hip.</HI> And I wi&s;h the <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> which were lately printed for the yearly Gathering a &s;mall <HI>Stock</HI> or <HI>Fund</HI> in parti|cular <HI>Congregations</HI> for pious and charitable U&s;es, might find <HI>Acceptance</HI> in our Churches, and prove a happy <HI>Means</HI> of fulfilling my <HI>Text</HI> among us.</P>
<P>But there is <HI>one</HI> Thing, the Work and Duty of the pre&s;ent <HI>Day,</HI> which I may not <HI>omit,</HI> if I would be <HI>ju&s;t</HI> either to my <HI>Text</HI> or to my <HI>Country;</HI> which is &mdash; <HI>That your Merchandize and Hire mu&s;t be for Them which dwell before the Lord, to eat &s;uffi|ciently and for durable Clothing.</HI> How &s;hall it be called <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord</HI> without this? You mu&s;t make Con&s;cience of &s;upporting your <HI>Mini|&s;ters,</HI> who &s;erve in the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> and at the <HI>Altar</HI> of God.

This is to your poor <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> like a <HI>hundred</HI> lit|tle Streams uniting on <HI>them,</HI> and bearing them away as with a <HI>Flood;</HI> or like <HI>a &s;weeping Rain</HI> that <HI>leaves no Food.</HI> You mu&s;t up in&s;tantly or it will <HI>wa&s;h away</HI> the Field of God, his <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> from off the Face of the Land.

<P>To <HI>Them</HI> it indeed belongs nextly and more immediately, who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion in a <HI>Church-State</HI> is this <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord;</HI> and it is the Duty of the re&s;pective <HI>Members</HI> in every Congregation to &s;ee to it that <HI>their Merchandi&s;e and Husbandry</HI> be &s;o, and that <HI>their Pa&s;tors</HI> have <HI>Meat &s;ufficient</HI> and <HI>durable Clothing.</HI> &mdash; For with what Face and

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI>_TYRE</HI> is the <HI>City</HI> here &s;poken of; and a very good and great <HI>Word</HI> it is that is here &s;poken of her. It is a <HI>Prophecy</HI> of the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Ty|rians</HI> by the preached <HI>Go&s;|pel;</HI> and how they &s;hould u&s;e their <HI>Wealth</HI> in the Day when God &s;hould convert them. And what is here written concern|ing them is for our learning, being a Direction and Precept to us, that <HI>our</HI> Merchandi&s;e and Hire &s;hould be <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004002_0014_10037F50AC2D3FF8">
<HI>Tyre</HI> was a <HI>Gentile City</HI> of great <HI>Antiquity,</HI> and Re|nown for <HI>Trade</HI> and Wealth, &s;cituate on the <HI>Me|diterranean Sea,</HI> near to the Lot of the Tribe of <HI>A&s;her.</HI> It was built by &s;ome Colony of the <HI>Zidonians,</HI> and is therefore in our Context called <HI>the Daughter of Zidon.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI>'s time we find the <HI>Tyrians</HI> faithful Allies and Friends of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> And as one well ob&s;erves, <Q>Trading Cities &s;eldom prove dan|gerous Enemies to their Neighbours; for they ac|quire and maintain their Grandeur, not by the Conque&s;t of others, but by Commerce with them.</Q></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Tyre</HI> were now grown the mo&s;t skilful in <HI>Sea Affairs</HI> of any in the World. A|bout the ninth Year of <HI>Hezekiah, Salmanezer</HI> the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> invaded and be&s;ieged them both by Sea and Land.

<P>Many of the <HI>Jews</HI> al&s;o were led to <HI>Tyre</HI> by their Trade, where they accidentally &s;pake of the <HI>Lord God</HI> of their Fathers, his Wor&s;hip, Laws and Works.

<P N="1">I. The Meaning of this <HI>Phra&s;e, Holine&s;s to the Lord</HI> mu&s;t be look'd into. And the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time that we find it us'd, than <HI>which</HI> there could not have been found any more <HI>eminent,</HI> was the <HI>Divine Order</HI> concern|ing the <HI>High Prie&s;ts Ve&s;tments,</HI> his <HI>Garments for Glory and Beauty,</HI> wherein <HI>he</HI> was to approach before the <HI>Lord,</HI> and mini&s;ter unto Him upon the <HI>mo&s;t &s;olemn Occa&s;ions:</HI> Exodus xxviii. 36, 37, 38. <HI>Thou &s;halt make a Plate of pure Gold, and grave upon it like the Ingravings of a Signet, Holine&s;s to the Lord: And thou &s;halt put it on a blue Lace, that it may be upon the Mitre, upon the Fore-front thereof; upon Aaron's Forehead, that he may bear the Iniquity of the Holy Things which the Children of I&s;rael &s;hall hallow in all their Holy Gifts; And it &s;hall be always upon his Forehead, that they may be accepted be|fore the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Now we may ob&s;erve in this fir&s;t Appointment of this <HI>Title</HI> &amp; <HI>In&s;cription,</HI> that it plainly was meant to &s;ignify, 1. The infinite Holine&s;s of the <HI>God of I&s;rael,</HI> and of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the <HI>great High Prie&s;t of our Pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</HI> 2.

P&s;alm xcix. <HI>The Lord is great in Zion, and high above all People: Let them prai&s;e thy great and ter|rible Name, for it is Holy; Exalt the Lord our God, and wor&s;hip at his holy Hill; for the Lord our God is Holy.</HI></P>

So that in this <HI>Title Holine&s;s to the Lord</HI> we have 1. the Holine&s;s of <HI>God:</HI> 2. a <HI>Con&s;ecration</HI> to Him, or the Separation of a Per&s;on or Thing to <HI>holy U&s;es:</HI> 3. <HI>Actual U&s;e</HI> and Imployment therein: and 4. in a &s;pecial <HI>Relation</HI> to his <HI>Wor&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, and in the highe&s;t manner declares, as <HI>in &s;hining Capitals of Gold,</HI> the infinite, unutterable, incomparable, inconceivable <HI>Holine&s;s of Jehovah, the only true God;</HI> that He is the <HI>Holy One,</HI> and <HI>alone</HI> Holy, <HI>glorious</HI> in Holine&s;s, the <HI>thrice</HI> Holy; and there is <HI>none</HI> Holy like Him or be|&s;ide Him.

<P N="1">2. It &s;peaks a <HI>Con&s;ecration</HI> of Per&s;ons and Things to God, a <HI>&s;eparation</HI> of them to his more immediate Service and Glory, to be of holy <HI>U&s;e</HI> according to his Will. So <HI>Aaron</HI> and the <HI>Prie&s;thood</HI> were of old &s;eparated and devoted to God, and therefore had <HI>this Name</HI> written on them, <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord.</HI> So the <HI>Sabbath</HI> is con&s;ecrated Time, and in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> called <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord,</HI> Exod. xxxi. 15. In like manner the very <HI>Fruit of the Trees in the fourth Year were holy to prai&s;e the Lord withal:</HI> Levit. xix. 24. The Hebrew Word is <HI>Holine&s;s;</HI> being given to the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and to the <HI>Poor.</HI> And the &s;ame is &s;aid of the <HI>Ve&s;&s;els</HI> of Silver and Gold, Bra&s;s and Iron, in <HI>Jerioo.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="004002_0026_10037FA82475C550">Jo&s;h. vi. 19.

<P N="3">But moreover, 3. <HI>Holine&s;s to God</HI> imports the <HI>actual U&s;e and Improvement</HI> of Per&s;ons and Things in the <HI>Service</HI> of God and to his <HI>Glory.</HI> When <HI>Aaron</HI> put on his <HI>Mitre</HI> it was actually to <HI>officiate</HI> before the Lord. He was then in a more &s;pecial manner to intend, de&s;ign and act for, the &s;anctifying God's Name in holy Mini&s;trations. <HI>De facto</HI> there was <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord</HI> in his right Di&s;po&s;itions, and Di&s;charge of his Office: El&s;e the Prie&s;thood and Wor&s;hippers <HI>profaned the Holine&s;s of the Lord which be loved.</HI> Mal. ii. 11. Otherwi&s;e, <HI>in their &s;et Office</HI> ("in the Di&s;charge of their Office to which they were <HI>&s;et apart"</HI>) <HI>they &s;anctified them&s;elves in Holine&s;s.</HI> 2 Chron. xxxi. 18. Then, and <HI>then</HI> only, were they <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> to the Lord, in <HI>Deed</HI> and in <HI>Truth.</HI> And &s;o are we to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> if we are holy in Heart and Life; if we <HI>live to Him in all holy Conver&s;ation,</HI> as in our <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> we have bound our Selves.</P>
<P N="4">4. And la&s;tly, This <HI>Motto, Holine&s;s to the Lord,</HI> has a more particular Regard to the <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> of God, his <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> and <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> his <HI>Ordinances</HI> and <HI>In&s;ti|tutions.</HI> So <HI>I&s;rael</HI> as Wor&s;hippers, and <HI>Aaron</HI> as a Prie&s;t, and the <HI>Sabbath</HI> as the Day of weekly Wor|&s;hip, and the <HI>Fir&s;t-fruits</HI> as offered in Wor&s;hip, were dignified with this <HI>Style</HI> of Holy to the Lord. So when <HI>we</HI> by the Grace of God devote, u&s;e and im|ploy <HI>our</HI> Souls and Bodies, our Gifts and Powers, our Time and E&s;tate, in the Services of Religion, and for promoting his Wor&s;hip, they become <HI>Holi|ne&s;s to the Lord.</HI> We become in our <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> as

<P N="2">II. Our Merchandi&s;e and Wealth is <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord,</HI> when what is con&s;ecrated and devoted out of our <HI>E&s;tate,</HI> is actually <HI>u&s;ed</HI> and imployed in the <HI>Ser|vice</HI> of God, according to his <HI>Will.

<P>It is to be feared that many <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> do not eno' apprehend and con&s;ider, that their <HI>worldly E&s;tate</HI> enters into their <HI>general Vow,</HI> and is always a Part of it, in their <HI>Self-Dedication</HI> to God. But God's Part is <HI>holy to Him</HI> whether we con&s;ider it or no; and if we render Him his Part, the <HI>whole</HI> is &s;ancti|fied unto us. There is not <HI>Holine&s;s to God</HI> written

But if we are actually honou|ring God with our whole Man, Soul and Body, the Powers of the one, and the Endowments of the other, the <HI>Spirit of the Living God</HI> dwells and rules in us, and has <HI>graven on us,</HI> as in Letters of Gold, <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> to Him&s;elf.

The <HI>Alms</HI> of Believers go up for <HI>a Memo|rial</HI> before God, with their <HI>Prayers;</HI> as did tho&s;e of <HI>Cornelius.</HI> The <HI>Great High Prie&s;t,</HI> at the <HI>Golden Altar</HI> within the <HI>Vail,</HI> pre&s;ents the one and the other in the <HI>Cloud of Incen&s;e,</HI> his own Merits &amp; Interce&s;&s;ion. <HI>He,</HI> the <HI>Holy One</HI> of God, was <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord</HI> above all the Sons of Men; and his Miracles of <HI>Mercy</HI> were like his Prayers and Devotions beyond number, and alike honorary to God. God will have <HI>his poor</HI> fed, as well as his <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI> And why not? are they not together <HI>Heirs of his Kingdom?</HI> and has he not put them together again and again, the <HI>Levite</HI> and the <HI>Poor</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xvi. 11, 14. xxvi. 11.13.</NOTE>, in his Peoples rejoicing before him on his <HI>&s;olemn Fea&s;ts?</HI></P>
<P>But give me leave more <HI>particularly</HI> to prove, by three or four <HI>Arguments,</HI> that Works of <HI>Charity to the poor</HI> are proper <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. They are <HI>Obedience to the Law of God</HI> which is mo&s;t holy. The <HI>Word</HI> of God is the Rule of Holi|ne&s;s,
<PB N="22" REF="004002_0034_10035F4AE09F22A0">and one of its grand Rules and Laws to us is <HI>Alms-deeds,</HI> and acts of Charity. The&s;e are an e|minent Branch of that <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> which the Lord re|quires, Zech. vii. 9. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, Shew Mercy every one to his Brother.</HI> Only let what we do be done in Obedience to God, for his Glory, and with a pure Re&s;pect to his Will, not <HI>to be &s;een of Men;</HI> ha|ving true <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion one of another, loving as Brethren, pitiful, courteous, tender-hearted</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matth. vi. 1. 1 Pet. iii. 8. Ephe&s;. iv. 32.</NOTE>; otherwi&s;e there is no <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> to the Lord, nor <HI>Reward</HI> from our <HI>Fa|ther that is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To give to the <HI>poor</HI> out of our E&s;tates is <HI>Holi|ne&s;s to the Lord,</HI> becau&s;e it is <HI>our Conformity to God and Chri&s;t in their Bounties and Mercies to the indigent and mi&s;erable.</HI> Conformity to the Holy God is <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> but <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> and Mercy to the poor is Confor|mity to God; <HI>who maketh his Sun to ri&s;e and his Rain to fall on the evil and on the good; Be ye therefore per|fect as your Father in Heaven is perfect.</HI> Mat. v. 45, 48. So <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> approved Him&s;elf to be the <HI>Holy One</HI> in the Days of his Fle&s;h, by filling up his Life with Acts of <HI>God-like Charity and Mercy.</HI> They <HI>cried after Him,</HI> laid them&s;elves in his Way, <HI>and he healed them all.</HI> This was <HI>Holine&s;s to his Father,</HI> and in the Sight of Men, and we &s;hould lay up in our Hearts his me|morable Words, Acts xx. 35. <HI>It is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A right and charitable Di&s;po&s;ition is <HI>the Fruit of the Holy Spirit</HI> in us, &amp; therefore can be no other than <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord. "The Fruit of the Spirit is Love</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 22. Phil. ii. 1. Col. iii. 12.</NOTE>. There is much of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God in Bowels of Pity to one another.

<P>And thus we have &s;een that the <HI>actual U&s;e</HI> &amp; <HI>Im|provement</HI> of our E&s;tates in the Service of God, in Works of <HI>Piety and Charity,</HI> renders them Holine&s;s to the Lord. &mdash; But there mu&s;t be &s;omething added by way of <HI>Caution</HI> and Limitation, and that is</P>

<P N="1">1.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Our <HI>Dependence</HI> mu&s;t be on God for his <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> to make our lawful Endeavours pro&s;perous; For it is the Ble&s;&s;ing of God <HI>that makes rich,</HI> and it is <HI>He</HI> that <HI>gives us Power to get Wealth;</HI> it is therefore <HI>prophane and unholy</HI> to act in our worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s but with a Dependance on the Governing and over|ruling Providence of a wi&s;e and Sovereign God: James iv. 14. <HI>Go to now you that &s;ay, To Day or to Morrow we will</HI> be here or there, do this or that, and <HI>make Gain; Whereas ye ought to &s;ay, If the Lord will</HI> we &s;hall do &s;o.

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We mu&s;t daily commit our worldly Af|fairs to God in <HI>Prayer,</HI> and more e&s;pecially at Times our more important Concerns and Intere&s;ts.
