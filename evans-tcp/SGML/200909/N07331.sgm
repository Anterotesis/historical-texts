<P>BUT none &s;aith, Where is God my maker, who giveth &s;ongs in the night? Who teacheth us more than the bea&s;ts of the earth, and maketh us wi&s;er than the fowls of heaven.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE &s;ubject that lies before me to be treated of, according to the method directed to, by the late honourable, learned, and pious Founder of this lecture, is that of <HI>Natural Religion.</HI> And that which is commonly &s;o called (tho' variou&s;ly defined by learned men) I apprehend to con&s;i&s;t in &s;uch laws, or rules of moral con|duct, as are founded on deductions from prin|ciples of meer natural rea&s;on relative to <HI>divinity</HI> and <HI>morality,</HI> without the aids of any &s;uperna|tural revelation. This is natural religion in theory. The practice of it con&s;i&s;ts in the due ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e rules.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="009363_0003_1031BE2352980A50">IT is the excellency of natural religion, that it hath it's foundation in the rational nature of man, and is therefore &s;table, fixed, and indi&s;|pen&s;able, and no more capable of variation or change, than the rea&s;on of man, and the rela|tion he bears to his Maker, as his creature, &s;ubject, and &s;ervant; it is fundamental to all civil order, the welfare of &s;ociety, and laws of government, all the laws and precepts of it being con&s;onant to eternal truth and equity.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, if we con&s;ider it, with re&s;pect to the great end of all religion, the guiding men to God as their ultimate, &s;upream happine&s;s, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that the meer religion of nature, which was calculated for a &s;tate of innocent, uncorrupt nature, and could &s;erve to this end only in &s;uch a &s;tate, is now, in the pre&s;ent degenerate &s;tate of mankind, in many re&s;pects defective, and in&s;ufficient to con|duct him to his great end; and needs the &s;up|ply of &s;uch helps, means and advantages, as the &s;cripture-revelation furni&s;hes us with.</P>
<P>YET the preaching of natural religion is highly u&s;eful to a chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly, in re&s;pect both of it's excellencies, and deficiencies. In the former re&s;pect,&mdash;as it is adopted into the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, and makes a con&s;iderable part of it, even the whole of chri&s;tian morality; and it is for the honour and commendation of our holy <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> religion above all other religions in the world, that it is allowed to be the highe&s;t and be&s;t improvement of the religion of nature,
<PB N="5" REF="009363_0004_1031BE25CA381AA8">
as it comprehends and injoins the precepts of the natural law, in the fulle&s;t extent and per|fection, and &s;ettles the practice of them on right grounds. And in the latter re&s;pect&mdash;(<HI>viz.</HI> of it's <HI>deficiencies</HI>) as it &s;hews us how &s;ea&s;onably the chri&s;tian revelation comes in to our &s;uccour, where natural light fails, and how aptly it cor|re&s;ponds to the principles of uncorrupt rea&s;on, and receives light and confirmation from them; and how happily it falls in with, and crowns, the wi&s;hes and expectations of nature in the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of men.</P>
<P>'TIS with &s;ome view to each of the&s;e, that I propo&s;e to con&s;ider the&s;e words of <HI>Elihu</HI> (who is not without rea&s;on &s;uppos'd by &s;ome to be the in&s;pired penman of this book of <HI>Job</HI>) who, having ob&s;erved under the providence of almighty God, the many evils, and calamities that mankind groan under, particularly the oppre&s;&s;ions, and wrongs they meet with from the great and powerful, which cau&s;e them to cry, and com|plain; <HI>they cry out</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>by rea&s;on of the arm of the mighty:</HI> To vindicate the ju&s;tice of divine providence in permitting this, and not appear|ing immediately for the re&s;cue of the oppre&s;&s;ed and injured, he introduces the words I have read; <HI>but none &s;aith, Where is God my maker, who giveth &s;ongs in the night? who teacheth us more than the bea&s;ts of the earth,</HI> &amp;c. which intimate the rea&s;on, why their complaints and exclamations again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors were &s;o little regarded, to wit, becau&s;e of their irreligious neglect of
<PB N="6" REF="009363_0005_1031BE28B28CC3F0">
God in their troubles: they were not &s;olicitous to acquaint them&s;elves with him, nor to apply them&s;elves to him for relief, as rea&s;onable crea|tures ought to have done, whom God has di&s;tingui&s;hed from, and dignified far above the brutes, by enduing them with the noble powers of rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, whereby they are capacitated, and therefore obliged to know the God that made them, to pay him homage and &s;ervice, to reverence his maje&s;ty, and repair to his mercy in their &s;traits and difficulties.</P>
<P>THE words may be conceiv'd as expre&s;&s;ive both of lamentation and admiration. It is to be lamented, that God &s;hould be &s;o much for|gotten and neglected in this our world, that there &s;hould be &s;o few, that do &s;eriou&s;ly enquire after God our common <HI>maker,</HI> even when urg'd to it by their nece&s;&s;ities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and when he alone is all-&s;ufficient to admini&s;ter effectual &s;uccour and &s;olace to them in the darke&s;t <HI>night</HI> of affliction. 'Tis al&s;o matter of admiration that man, who by the bounty of his creator, is advanc'd to the rank and dignity of an intelli|gent being, far &s;uperior in knowledge and wi&s;dom to meer &s;en&s;itive animals, the bea&s;ts and fowls, &s;hould not yet go beyond tho&s;e irra|tionals, in their cries and moans, when pinch'd with hunger, or otherwi&s;e afflicted with a &s;en&s;e of pain, and not ri&s;e up to any &s;uitable acknow|ledgements of their maker, to a dependance on him, enquiries after him, addre&s;&s;es to him, and expectations from him; all which might rea&s;o|nably

and ju&s;tly be expected from man, in con|&s;ideration of his rational capacities. Strange &s;tupidity! But not to take any further critical notice of the words, I &s;hall, from this general view, make the&s;e two ob&s;ervations, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>OBSERVATION I. THAT <HI>there is matter of duty expected and required of man purely as he is a rea&s;onable creature,</HI> whom God hath taught more than the bea&s;ts of the earth, and made wi&s;er than the fowls of heaven.</P>
<P>OBSERVATION II. THAT <HI>men do yet gene|rally fail in tho&s;e duties which their own rea|&s;on, if duely attended to, would lead and oblige them to the ob&s;ervance of.</HI> None &s;aith, Where is God my maker&mdash;Tho' this is the main purpo&s;e for which he has taught them more than the bea&s;ts and fowls, more than to groan and complain under their cala|mities.</P>
<P>I SHALL endeavour, with as much brevity as I can, to &s;peak to the&s;e two heads.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>THAT there is matter of duty expected and required of man, purely as he is a rea&s;onable creature.</HI></P>
<P>THE great creator, in the fir&s;t con&s;titution of man's nature, put within him a principle of rea|&s;on and intelligence, whereby he was dignified and exalted far above the brute creation. For

And in the&s;e things lies the di&s;tingui&s;hing excellency of man above the bea&s;ts of the earth and the fowls of heaven, by which al&s;o he is made their lord, and appointed to have the dominion over them.</P>
<P>THE capacities of the rational &s;oul of man are va&s;t and admirable: It is capable of appre|hending things pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come; whereas bea&s;ts are intent only on things pre&s;ent to &s;en&s;e. It is capable of conceiving and di&s;|cour&s;ing of &s;uch things as are ab&s;tracted from &s;en&s;e and matter, of metaphy&s;ical propo&s;itions, of the nature, and perfections of God, of angels and &s;pirits, and of drawing conclu&s;ions about
<PB N="9" REF="009363_0008_1031BE30633F1A10">
them&mdash;capable of all arts and &s;ciences, and of many &s;kilful inventions, in which it is divinely in&s;tructed.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxviii. 26.</NOTE> The powers of this rational and intelligent mind of man are of va&s;t extent in the knowledge of nature. He is capable of ran&s;ack|ing the creation, and &s;urveying the works of God in the heavens, earth and &s;eas, from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t, by the help of <HI>tele&s;copes</HI> and <HI>micro&s;copes,</HI> and of tracing the foot&s;teps and impre&s;&s;ions of a Deity, in the plain marks di&s;|cernable in them of an infinitely wi&s;e and de|&s;igning mind, the framer of them all. He is thereby made capable of contemplating the hea|venly bodies that roll above us, and of ob&s;er|ving their beauty, order, po&s;ition, di&s;tances, mo|tions, influences, and u&s;es; the harmonies, combinations, and confederacies of nature; the mutual dependencies, and &s;ub&s;erviencies of the various creatures among them&s;elves; all condu|cing to the good of the univer&s;e, and ultimately to the creator's glory.</P>
<P>OF this capacity and di&s;po&s;ition of the nobler part of man, there are certain &s;ignatures in the make or compo&s;ition of his bodily part; in that when the re&s;t of inferior animals are made with a downward look towards the earth, man is made (as the heathen Poet has ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Prona&abque; cum &s;pectant animalia caetera terram,</L>

heaven, being de&s;igned by nature, and aptly di&s;po&s;ed to contemplate the heavens, and to a&s;|cend in his contemplations to an invi&s;ible crea|tor, who&s;e glory is above the heavens. And tho' there are many things common to man and bea&s;t, in re&s;pect of the animal life, which we here live, yet there is a va&s;t difference between the &s;pirit of the one and the other, which ap|pears e&s;pecially at death, when (as <HI>Solomon</HI> di|vinely notes <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. iii. 31.</NOTE>) <HI>the &s;pirit of a bea&s;t goeth down|ward to the earth,</HI> but <HI>the &s;pirit of man</HI> &s;oars above, and a&s;cends to its native region of &s;pirits, agree|ably to the &s;uperiority of its nature and faculties.</P>
<P>BUT, to come nearer our purpo&s;e, it is e&s;pe|cially, by means of the rational powers of man's &s;oul, that he is capable of religion and morality, of the knowledge of the great author of his be|ing, and of pre&s;enting a rea&s;onable &s;ervice to him. And herein e&s;pecially God has taught us <HI>more than the bea&s;ts and fowls.</HI> For tho' there are &s;trange in&s;tincts in &s;ome of tho&s;e animals, that have a re&s;emblance of rea&s;on in man, whence &s;ome have thought there is a lower degree of rea&s;on pertaining to bea&s;ts; but were this gran|ted, it mu&s;t al&s;o be confe&s;&s;ed, that rea&s;on in man is of a divers kind, as well as tran&s;cendent in degree, as the in&s;tances now mentioned of the largene&s;s and extent of man's intellectual capacities, do abundantly demon&s;trate; [all the rea&s;oning in bea&s;ts (if it mu&s;t be &s;o call'd) being confin'd to &s;en&s;ible objects, may equally be re|&s;olved into natural in&s;tinct] but from all that is
<PB N="11" REF="009363_0010_1031BE34E2981FF8">
ob&s;ervable in the brute creatures, there appears not the lea&s;t &s;ymptom, or &s;hadow of any approa|ches to religion, not the lea&s;t affinity or re&s;em|blance to the human nature in a religious di&s;po|&s;ition. And therefore many chu&s;e to place the &s;pecifick difference between man and bea&s;ts, in religion, rather than in rea&s;on. Bea&s;ts, 'tis evi|dent, have the knowledge of plea&s;ure and pain, by &s;en&s;e, and are thereby taught to pur&s;ue the one, and &s;hun the other; but they have no knowledge of virtue and vice, nor of the plea|&s;ure that attends on virtue, nor of the pain that follows vice. This is peculiar to man, who by a &s;ort of rational in&s;tinct &s;oon di&s;cerns the diffe|rence between moral good and evil, and in &s;ome ca&s;es previous to all in&s;truction and di&s;cipline; and therefore is a &s;ubject capable of a moral law, and of government, by rewards and penalties; and con&s;equently accountable for his actions, good or bad. He has a capacity for improving and enobling his mind by moral virtues, fitting him for agreable conver&s;e in human &s;ociety; and more than this, a capacity for religious conver&s;e with his Maker, of bearing his moral image in knowledge and holine&s;s, fitting him for bli&s;sful communion with him.</P>
<P>NOW do not the&s;e high and noble capacities of man's rea&s;onable nature infer a moral obliga|tion he is under to proportionable duties? Mo&s;t certainly they do; otherwi&s;e man would be no more &s;ubject to blame for not enquiring, <HI>where is God my maker,</HI> than the bea&s;ts them&s;elves;
<PB N="12" REF="009363_0011_1031BE39BB01C620">
which &s;ufficiently verifies the propo&s;ition I laid down, that man's duty may be argued from his rea&s;onable nature and capacities, tho' de&s;titute of external revelation, (I mean his duty, &s;o far as lies within the compa&s;s of his under&s;tanding); and this is what I propo&s;e to &s;hew in the further pro&s;ecuting this point,&mdash;That God has put this principle of intellectual light into the nature of man to di&s;cover his duty to him, and to direct him in his whole moral behaviour, and al&s;o given it the force of a law to oblige him to the practice of it; the &s;ame which is commonly called the <HI>light and law of nature,</HI> or the light and dictates of con&s;cience: For con&s;cience is nothing el&s;e but the rea&s;on and judgment of man, as it is peculiarly conver&s;ant about his religious and moral acts, in its reflections on pa&s;t actions, and directions of the future, and pa&s;&s;ing judgment on them, as it is &s;ubject to the judgment of God.</P>
<P>I SHALL therefore endeavour to &s;hew, that God has given man rea&s;on for this two-fold end, 1&s;t. to be a light to di&s;cover his duty to him; and 2dly, to have the force of a law to bind his duty upon him.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. REASON is given man for a light to di&s;|cover his duty to him, and to guide him in the practice of it. There is a three-fold object of our moral conduct commonly known. God, our neighbour, and our&s;elves; and the princi|ples of our rea&s;onable nature dictate our duty towards this three-fold object, and our whole duty as rea&s;onable creatures may be reduced to the&s;e three heads,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="13" REF="009363_0012_1031BE3B466855C8">(1.) THERE are in our rea&s;onable nature or (which is the &s;ame) in the natural law, prin|ciples of piety, which dictate our duty towards God. Here, the grand fundamental principle of piety and of all religion, is the knowledge and belief of the exi&s;tence of a God. This great truth is prior to all revelation; for we mu&s;t fir&s;t believe there is a God, before we can receive any revelation as from him. And this mu&s;t be fir&s;t received by means of rational con|viction, or by &s;uch proofs as are adapted to the apprehen&s;ion of our rea&s;on; tho' divine revela|tion makes them more clear and &s;trong. God hath given abundant demon&s;tration of his exi&s;|tence to all mankind, to the whole world of rational beings, partly, by the impre&s;&s;ions of his being and perfections he has left on the hearts and con&s;ciences of men, as the God of nature; partly, by the external manife&s;tation of him&s;elf in his works of creation: And this &s;eems the meaning of the apo&s;tle's word when, &s;peak|ing of the Gentile world, he tells us, <HI>That which may be known of God</HI> (his being and perfections as an object of wor&s;hip) <HI>is manife&s;t in them,</HI> (i. e. by inward impre&s;&s;ions, or <HI>the law written in their hearts</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 19. and ii. 15.</NOTE>) <HI>for God hath &s;hewed it to them;</HI> (i. e. by his external works, vi&s;ible, e&s;pecially in the creation of the world,) and thereupon brings in this great evidence of the being of an eternal, almighty God,&mdash;<HI>For the invi&s;ible things of him, from the creation of the world are clearly
<PB N="14" REF="009363_0013_1031BE3CCB0C3388">
&s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Romans i. 20.</NOTE> The vi&s;ible glories of the firmament, the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars proclaim to all the world the being and glory of that invi&s;ible power which formed them, and pre&s;ides over them. <HI>There is no &s;peech or language where their voice is not heard.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xix. 1.3.</NOTE> The &s;ilent language of the&s;e natural prea|chers is interpreted and under&s;tood among all nations to the ends of the earth, by that portion of rea&s;on which God has imparted to them.&mdash; Men are compell'd by the force of meer natural rea&s;on to acknowledge a fir&s;t cau&s;e which is eternally &s;elf-exi&s;tent, for nothing is more cer|tain than that &s;ome being mu&s;t have exi&s;ted from eternity, otherwi&s;e nothing could ever have been. But to exi&s;t from eternity is to be &s;elf-exi&s;tent, or to have no cau&s;e of exi&s;tence; which is incompatible to every finite being, and can agree only to a being that is infinite. As to the notion of the world, or the matter of it, it's being from eternity, or it's being ca&s;t into the pre&s;ent form by an eternal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cau|&s;es and effects, it is &s;o &s;hockingly ab&s;urd, that the rea&s;on of mankind cannot but reject it at fir&s;t &s;ight. And it is &s;carce to be believed po&s;&s;i|ble for the greate&s;t athei&s;t to a&s;&s;ent to it on clear and &s;ure grounds. But when we &s;ay, God is a being &s;elf-exi&s;tent, it is to be under&s;tood nega|tively, not as affirming him to be the cau&s;e of his own exi&s;tence, but as excluding all other cau&s;es, and a&s;&s;erting him to be a being of &s;uch
<PB N="15" REF="009363_0014_1031BE40F7E63610">
a nature, as nece&s;&s;arily and eternally to exi&s;t without any cau&s;e at all, by the meer preroga|tive of his own infinite e&s;&s;ence, in a manner to us, and all finite intelligences inconceivable; for when we arrive at <HI>infinite,</HI> (in &s;earching out a fir&s;t cau&s;e) as by the impul&s;e of our own rea|&s;on we mu&s;t at la&s;t, whatever cour&s;e of argu|ment we pur&s;ue, there all rea&s;oning and di&s;pute mu&s;t cea&s;e, and give way to admiration.</P>
<P>WE &s;ay then upon principles of natural rea&s;on, it is an undoubted conclu&s;ion, there is an all-glorious God, the creator and fir&s;t cau&s;e of all things, being him&s;elf uncau&s;ed, eternally exi&s;t|ing, independent, a nece&s;&s;ary being, &s;elf-&s;uffi|cient, having all fulne&s;s of being and perfection conceivable or po&s;&s;ible in him&s;elf, ab&s;olutely &s;upream in all perfection, in knowledge, wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, power, ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s, and love, every where pre&s;ent, conver&s;ant with his rea&s;o|nable creatures, ob&s;ervant of their behaviour, &s;u&s;taining the relation of a father, governor, and judge to them. For there is this principle of natural light further to be added, which dictates our duty towards God, <HI>viz.</HI> the belief of a divine providence, which in&s;pects and governs all the affairs of the world, and of mankind e&s;pecially. And as man is con&s;tituted a &s;ubject of moral government, and therefore accountable to his maker, 'tis rational, therefore, to expect, that he will call him to an account for his behaviour, and reward or puni&s;h him as his deeds require. But the&s;e great articles of natural religion, be|ing

all our fellow men.

To this let me add that rational maxim, adopted by our Saviour into his evangelical law, of doing to others what we would they &s;hould do to us in like circum&s;tances, both the law, and the pro|phets, natural and revealed religion, con&s;pire to recommend and enforce this maxim, being foun|ded on rea&s;on and nature.

<P N="3">(3.) THERE are al&s;o in our rea&s;onable nature principles that lead to &s;obriety and temperance in the right government of our&s;elves. The&s;e are, that as &s;ubjects and &s;ervants of our great Creator, and Lord, we ought to pre&s;erve the powers and faculties both of our bodies and

Again, it is a rational principle, agreeable to the primitive order, and con&s;titution of nature (ac|cording to which rea&s;on and under&s;tanding were made to lead and rule, and the will and inferior faculties to obey and follow) that we &s;hould keep up the dominion of rea&s;on over brutal appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, to check and con|troul them, and not &s;uffer them at any time to get the a&s;cendant in the &s;oul, which is as great a di&s;order in nature, as that in the &s;tate, which <HI>Solo|mon</HI> complains of, that of <HI>&s;ervants riding on hor&s;e back, and princes walking as &s;ervants on the earth.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. 7.10.</NOTE> All intemperance proceeds from the unruline&s;s of the bodily appetites and affections, their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the bounds of rea&s;on and mode|ration, and 'tis the office of temperance, to re|&s;train them within tho&s;e bounds, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of rea&s;on, which it hath by divine right in the &s;oul of man, and to &s;trengthen it again&s;t the u&s;urpation of &s;en&s;e and appetite.

there are divers maxims of rea&s;on, by which men ordinarily govern them&s;elves in their civil affairs, which may be applied to the law of temperance. To mention one or two. 'Tis ac|counted a maxim of wi&s;dom, to forego a le&s;s good, in order to obtain a greater, or to deny ones &s;elf in a &s;mall matter of plea&s;ure, or profit, when one has the pro&s;pect of a very great ad|vantage in &s;o doing; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, ought we not to quit the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, in order to the more &s;ublime, manly plea&s;ure of wi&s;dom and virtue? Another, that bears &s;ome affinity to this is, that we ought to &s;ubmit to a le&s;&s;er evil to avoid a greater, or of two evils to chu&s;e the le&s;s, and does not this teach us, it is our wi&s;dom to &s;ubmit to the pains of &s;elf-denial in laying re&s;traints on the &s;en&s;ual appetite, and mortifying a lu&s;t, rather than by an unbounded gratification, to incur the lo&s;s of health, e&s;tate, reputation, and to become expos'd to the &s;tings and reproaches of an injured con&s;cience, which will follow &s;uch gratifications: To &s;ay nothing of a future vengeance. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour has founded many of his wi&s;e cautions, and admoni|tions upon &s;uch rational maxims: Particularly, that of mortifying a beloved lu&s;t; it is better for thee, &s;aith he, <HI>that one of thy members peri&s;h,</HI> than <HI>that thy whole body &s;hould be ca&s;t into hell.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth.

laid down carry their own evidence with them, and need not a train of rea&s;oning and di&s;cour&s;e to beget a&s;&s;ent, but may be reckoned among the fir&s;t and radical principles of the natural law. And hence we &s;ee our duty with re&s;pect to God, our neighbour, and our&s;elves, di&s;coverable by the clear light of rea&s;on. Wherefore I proceed now to &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2^d^l^y^. GOD has given rea&s;on to man to have the force of a law to bind his duty upon him. The light whereby rea&s;on di&s;covers man's duty to him, infers an obligation upon him to the practice of it. This will more plainly appear, if we con&s;ider what things are requi&s;ite to give force to a law. There are the&s;e three things e&s;|pecially. (1.) It mu&s;t be an act of lawful au|thority in giving commands. (2.) It mu&s;t have a &s;anction of ju&s;t rewards and penalties annexed to tho&s;e commands, to guard them again&s;t tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions. (3.) There mu&s;t be a righteous judge to take an account of the ob&s;ervance of them, to acquit or condemn as men &s;hall be found on their trial. The&s;e are all the requi&s;ites to the binding force of any law, and they all concur in the law of man's rea&s;onable nature. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) ITS authority is of divine right. God, who is our rightful lord and lawgiver, has gi|ven it this authority, which needs no other proof than his being the author of the law of nature, which is therefore &s;aid to be written in the heart of man.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 15.</NOTE> But by whom &s;hould it be written
<PB N="23" REF="009363_0022_1031BE54B611A108">
there, but by God alone, in the very con&s;titution of the nature of man, as endued with rea&s;on, to be the means or in&s;trument of his moral govern|ment over him? So that the dictates of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, which di&s;cover and determine what is &s;in, and what is duty, are to be regar|ded as divine laws. Hence the under&s;tanding rea&s;onable <HI>&s;prit of man,</HI> is called by <HI>Solomon the can|dle of the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xx. 27.</NOTE> It is a candle lighted up in every man's &s;oul by the author of nature, who&s;e in&s;piration giveth him under&s;tanding, to enable him to di&s;cern between right and wrong, good and evil. This light of nature, therefore, is a divine light, and the authority of its dictates di|vine. Therefore to obey rea&s;on is to obey God, who hath dictated his will to us concerning our moral actions, by that rea&s;on and under&s;tanding he hath given us, as really as by his written word.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THESE natural dictates of rea&s;on have al&s;o a &s;anction.&mdash;Tho&s;e hopes and fears of men's hearts, re&s;ulting from their moral conduct, may be regarded as a natural &s;anction to the law of rea&s;on; as they have a &s;en&s;e of joy or pain that follows on the doing good, or evil; men are na|turally con&s;cious to them&s;elves of the good or evil con&s;equences of either acting up to the prin|ciples of natural light, or deviating from them. The apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, that the Gentiles had a con&s;cience that excu&s;ed, or accu&s;ed on the doing good or evil. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 15.</NOTE> And the natural pre&s;ages and
<PB N="24" REF="009363_0023_1031BE56417C9998">
fears of a vengeance that pur&s;ues unrighteous practices, and certain forebodings of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, together with the pre&s;ent feelings of con&s;cience, its comfort and &s;atisfaction on well doing, its reproaches, &s;tings and remor&s;es on the commi&s;&s;ion of evil, &s;erve in&s;tead of more po&s;itive declarations, to guard the law of nature.</P>
<P>THERE is another pa&s;&s;ion of human nature very painful and di&s;quieting, con&s;equent on vice, which may be, and often is, a re&s;traint upon men from vicious actions, and that is <HI>&s;hame.</HI> After the commi&s;&s;ion of any vile, or wicked act, men are affected not only with fear in a &s;en&s;e of guilt, but with &s;hame in a &s;en&s;e of the turpitude, di&s;hone&s;ty, and vilene&s;s of their behaviour, their having acted an unrea&s;onable part, unbecoming them&s;elves, and un&s;uitably to the dignity and prerogative of their rea&s;onable nature, which expo&s;es them to the &s;evere reproaches of their own hearts, and &s;elf-upbraidings for their folly and ba&s;ene&s;s, having no rational plea for their ju&s;tification. The nature of man was a &s;tranger to this irk&s;ome di&s;quieting pa&s;&s;ion till &s;in enter'd, by which it was debas'd and de&s;poiled of its dig|nity.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. ii. 25.</NOTE> And this adds force to the obligation men are under to act becoming the honour of their nature, by a &s;trict conformity to the dic|tates of right rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="25" REF="009363_0024_1031BE57C975A950">(3.) THE binding force of the&s;e principles and dictates of nature do plainly &s;uppo&s;e and require a judge, to whom belongs the execu|tion of the law which is nece&s;&s;ary to enforce the whole, to whom all men mu&s;t hold them&s;elves accountable. And the &s;ame natural light that manife&s;ts a God that made and rules the world, doth al&s;o beget a per&s;ua&s;ion of his being the righteous judge of his rea&s;onable creatures. There is naturally in all men's hearts an indelible per&s;ua&s;ion of a governing ju&s;tice, that takes cog|nizance of the moral actions and behaviour of men, and mea&s;ures out &s;uitable puni&s;hments to men's crimes. One plain evidence of this is the u&s;e of oaths, &s;o frequent and common among all nations, at lea&s;t among all civilized nations, who di&s;cover any &s;en&s;e of a God. And in all &s;uch oaths there is, in the very nature of them, a &s;o|lemn appeal to an invi&s;ible judge, with an ac|knowledgment and belief of his taking cogni|zance of all that pa&s;&s;es among men, and of his being the patron of truth and innocence, and the righteous avenger of all inju&s;tice and perjury. And the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> te&s;tifies of tho&s;e, who were left only to the light of nature, that they <HI>knew the judgment of God,</HI> condemning them to <HI>death</HI> for &s;ins again&s;t that light.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 32.</NOTE> And &s;ince there ap|pears no equal di&s;tribution of rewards and pu|ni&s;hments in this life, worthy of the righteous governor of the world, rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts that it mu&s;t be expected in a future &s;tate. And the
<PB N="26" REF="009363_0025_1031BE5C9E1A1DA0">
&s;entiments and premonitions of con&s;cience (as an inferior judge) relative hereunto, do confirm this per&s;ua&s;ion. Nothing more, I think, need be added to evince the binding force of the prin|ciples of man's rea&s;onable nature. So I pa&s;s to &s;peak in a few words to the &s;econd ob&s;ervation,</P>

<P>THIRDLY, IT may be &s;aid to proceed from the in&s;ufficiency of natural light and rea&s;on, in the pre&s;ent degenerate &s;tate of men, to recover them to a right conduct. If it be &s;aid, tho' men have generally failed of their duty, and have gone out of the way, yet it is not fair to argue <HI>fact,</HI> and thence conclude the in&s;uffi|ciency of the religion of nature or rea&s;on to &s;et them right. <HI>I an&s;wer.</HI> Tho' there be other ways of proving the in&s;ufficiency of natural re|ligion to man degenerate, yet the &s;olution of the ca&s;e before us, as a que&s;tion of fact, will fairly infer the conclu&s;ion; for if it be true, if it may be fairly gathered from all the ob&s;ervations of mankind, that men have univer&s;ally degenera|ted into impiety and vice, then they are fallen from the law of nature, and are condemned by it, and fallen under a moral di&s;order; in this ca&s;e natural religion can bring no remedy. This mu&s;t come from another quarter: In many re|&s;pects the in&s;ufficiency of the religion of nature,
<PB N="31" REF="009363_0030_1031BE6B73CC5C58">
to recover mankind from their degeneracy, and bring them back to God as their &s;upream felicity might appear. I &s;hall fix on one in&s;tance to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that is, the duty of repen|tance. Both natural and revealed religion agree in requiring this duty of &s;inners, it is certainly the duty of a meer heathen, who has no other light than that of nature, to repent of his &s;ins. The conviction he has done ami&s;s, and the re|mor&s;e he feels in his con&s;cience thereupon, teach him without any other monitor, he ought to repent, but here natural religion is defective, as it cannot furni&s;h a &s;inner with &s;ufficient <HI>aids</HI> and <HI>inducements</HI> to repentance. The <HI>aids</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;tances it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to admini&s;ter, mu&s;t be from nature it&s;elf, but the di&s;tempered nature of a &s;inner cannot heal it&s;elf by any power it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, the cure mu&s;t be derived from a &s;upernatural influence. The light and power of rea&s;on is too much darkned and debilitated (e&s;pecially being bribed by corrupt pa&s;&s;ions) to be able to throw off vicious cu&s;toms, and al&s;o to root out evil inclinations and reform the heart, which is the work of true repentance: The on|ly effectual relief and help in this ca&s;e, is that which the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t propounds and offers, which is <HI>the mini&s;tration of the Spirit.</HI> If &s;uch &s;uper-natural influences be &s;uppo&s;ed to reach the minds of any bred up in heatheni&s;m, who never heard of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, it mu&s;t be in an extraordinary method of vouch&s;afement quite unknown to us, and therefore un&s;afe to be a&s;&s;erted by us.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="009363_0031_1031BE6E52020410">AND then, natural religion affords no &s;uffici|ent <HI>inducements</HI> to repentance, as it gives a &s;inner no certain hope of pardon, if he does repent. The whole doctrine of redemption, and particu|larly that of atonement and &s;atisfaction for &s;in, in order to &s;ettle the con&s;cience of a &s;inner in peace and &s;ecurity, again&s;t the fears of avenging ju&s;tice, and the declarations and promi&s;es of for|givene&s;s to the penitent, con&s;equent thereon, lie entirely out of its view, being the peculiar &s;ub|ject of the go&s;pel revelation. And though there are general intimations of mercy to mankind in the cour&s;e of providence, yet the hopes of for|givene&s;s founded thereon, are too weak and ge|neral to bear down &s;trong prejudices, and to break the force of inveterate cu&s;toms of &s;in and vice; and the important enquiry will &s;till recur to the inqui&s;itive mind, and anxious con&s;cience of a &s;inner, <HI>wherewith &s;hall I come before the Lord?</HI> &mdash;What &s;hall I do to appea&s;e offended ju&s;tice? &s;o that the mercies of God, in the cour&s;e of com|mon providence, are no argument of forgive|ne&s;s; for he bears <HI>with much long-&s;uffering the ve&s;&s;els of wrath.</HI></P>
<P>NOW will a &s;inner ever be induced to repent who has no certain hope or per&s;ua&s;ion, that God will thereupon forgive him? It is not rational to &s;uppo&s;e this; we might almo&s;t as rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e our fir&s;t parents to have repented in their de&s;pairing condition, immediately after their fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, before any hopes were given them by the promi&s;e of the <HI>&s;eed of the woman,</HI> as that
<PB N="33" REF="009363_0032_1031BE71C63BDB10">
a &s;inner might be expected to repent before, and without all hope of pardon, yet having once of|fended his maker, it is impo&s;&s;ible, had he the under&s;tanding of a <HI>&s;eraphim,</HI> that he &s;hould know without a revelation, that he would pardon the offence upon any terms what&s;oever.

<P>THUS we &s;ee in this in&s;tance, the deficiency of the religion of nature and rea&s;on, as a guide to man's duty and happine&s;s in his fallen &s;tate. This is not meant to throw the lea&s;t di&s;parage|ment on natural religion, the excellencies where|of have been in part reported; but to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of revealed, that the former might more effectually reach its end. There is an agreeable harmony between both natural and revealed re|ligion, they both befriend and &s;upport each other, and receive light and confirmation from each other. Without the principles of natural religi|on being laid as the foundation, we are uncapa|ble of receiving any revelation from God; but the&s;e being laid, are of excellent u&s;e and advan|tage, in our pur&s;uit of the ends of revelation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e with a few inferences.</P>
<P N="1">1. HENCE &s;ee our obligation to ble&s;s God for the gift of rea&s;on, which is &s;ome participa|tion of the image of our maker, whereby we are made capable of high and glorious purpo&s;es; not only exalted to a rank in the creation of God &s;uperior to bea&s;ts, but little inferior to an|gels,

and by means of our intelligent nature, are capable of fellow&s;hip with them, in the know|ledge and contemplation of the perfections of our Creator, and in glorifying him by active &s;ervice and homage. Hereby we are al&s;o capa|citated to be u&s;eful to our generation, and to at|tain happine&s;s for our&s;elves, and to u&s;e the means requi&s;ite thereunto, under the advantages of re|velation. In giving us rea&s;on and under&s;tand|ing God has given us the riche&s;t talent, of more value than all external advantages; and in con|tinuing to us the free and unclouded exerci&s;e of this faculty, even when deprived of other in|tere&s;ts, he may be &s;aid to <HI>give &s;ongs in the night,</HI> matter of &s;olace to our&s;elves, and of thank&s;gi|ving and prai&s;e to our Creator, in the lowe&s;t and darke&s;t outward condition: If this <HI>candle of the Lord</HI> &s;hine clear and bright within, it will open to us an inward &s;pring of refre&s;hment and joy, for which we &s;hall be obliged to be thankful to God.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE hence learn what great evil and guilt is contracted by counteracting our rea&s;on, or neglecting its dictates, by deba&s;ing or abu&s;ing it to &s;erve the vile purpo&s;es of the fle&s;h, and by &s;uffering &s;en&s;e and appetite to get the dominion over it: This is to degrade our&s;elves from our own &s;pecies, unto a level with the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, yea, we become wor&s;e than they; they are irrational by nature, we by choice, and &s;o aboli&s;h as far as in us lies the difference nature has put between man and bea&s;t.

<P N="3">3. LET us hence &s;ee what cau&s;e we have to be peculiarly thankful for that divine revelation we enjoy. 'Tis owing to the improvements of revelation that our natural rea&s;on is &s;o valuable a talent; its dimne&s;s brighten'd, its weakne&s;s &s;trengthen'd, its deficiencies abundantly and ad|mirably &s;upplied; without which, however u&s;e|ful on other accounts, yet with re&s;pect to life and happine&s;s, the main end of all religion would have left us to wander in the region and &s;hadow of death. This is a privilege by which we are di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the re&s;t of mankind; for as we are made to differ from brutes, and exalted above them, by rea&s;on, &s;o we are made to differ from, and priviledg'd above the bruti&s;h people of the earth, (as the ignorant and idolatrous hea|then are ju&s;tly &s;tiled) by revelation. Let us then be thankful for the light of rea&s;on, and peculi|arly

&s;o for the a&s;&s;i&s;tances afforded by the addi|tional light of revelation; and forever adore, and thankfully improve, the di&s;criminating grace of God towards us therein. Moreover,</P>

<P>BUT of what u&s;e is rea&s;on in matters of pure revelation, which is &s;upernatural, and tran&s;cends rea&s;on?</P>
<P>I SHALL an&s;wer in a few Words:</P>

CONSIDERING the in&s;ufficiency of the light and law of nature to guide mankind in this their fallen &s;tate, to their great end, they being yet evidently in a &s;tate of trial, under divine go|vernment; rea&s;on teaches, it is a thing worthy of God, and becoming his rectoral perfections, to give them a more perfect rule for that pur|po&s;e, and to &s;upply the defects of the natural law by revealing his mind and will to them, as a rule of government.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) 'TIS the office of rea&s;on to examine the proofs and evidences both internal and external, which are offered to authenticate the revelation, as coming from God to us.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) REASON is of great u&s;e in &s;earching into, and helping us to under&s;tand the &s;en&s;e and mea|ning of the revelation it&s;elf. And &s;o a meer di&s;|ciplinary knowledge may be &s;ufficient to give a right explanation of the words of the revelation, both the language and &s;en&s;e, though the <HI>things</HI> contained therein may need the illumination of the Spirit, in order to a right perception of them.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="38" REF="009363_0037_1031BE7F4940BE70">(4.) BEING &s;atisfied in the &s;ufficiency, clear|ne&s;s and conclu&s;ivene&s;s of the proofs and evi|dences of this revelation, rea&s;on teaches, we ought to receive it, to believe it, and &s;ubmit to it, as of divine authority, with as perfect ac|quie&s;cence of mind, as in the cleare&s;t dictates of natural light; tho' it contains things beyond the gra&s;p of our rea&s;on, things &s;eemingly incredible, and incomprehen&s;ible to our frail intellects, yet being a&s;&s;ured of the authenticne&s;s of the revela|tion, as coming from God, there is nothing in the world more rational than that we &s;hould receive them as divine truths; or that rea&s;on &s;hould &s;ubmit to faith, re&s;ting on the authority and veracity of the divine revealer.

<P N="5">5. WE &s;ee hence how vainly it is pretended, that chri&s;tianity is nothing el&s;e, but natural reli|gion revived, with a few po&s;itive in&s;titutions annexed. 'Tis readily granted that chri&s;tianity
<PB N="39" REF="009363_0038_1031BE81CDCB6EE0">
contains the natural law re&s;tored to its greate&s;t purity; but to &s;ay, this is the whole of chri&s;tia|nity, is only to give a chri&s;tian name to dei&s;m, and to deny an atoning Mediator to be a doctrine of chri&s;tianity. The chri&s;tian religion in the &s;trict and proper notion of it, may be con&s;idered as a &s;cheme of divine di&s;pen&s;ations, de&s;igned to reduce apo&s;tate man to the practice of natural religion, and to furni&s;h him with right princi|ples for that purpo&s;e; as this latter is under&s;tood to import a &s;y&s;tem of all the virtues requi&s;ite and conducive to the perfection and happine&s;s of man's rea&s;onable nature: And in this &s;trict accep|tation, chri&s;tianity is plainly di&s;tinct from natu|ral religion. If indeed we had been a race of innocent beings, natural religion might have &s;erved our turn, we had needed nothing more for &s;ecuring our final happine&s;s, than our conti|nuing obedient to the precepts of it: But a &s;in|ner needs a religion to teach him how to get re|conciled to an offended God, before he can en|tertain the lea&s;t hope of happine&s;s. The religion of nature teaches him nothing of this: If you &s;ay, it is an article of natural religion, that we ought to repent of our &s;ins, and thereby recon|cile our&s;elves to God, after having offended him: This indeed, I know is &s;aid; but upon what warrant? Perhaps, this is one of the refinements chri&s;tianity has made upon the religion of na|ture. But it is certain, the original law of nature knows nothing of a &s;inner's repentance, but con&s;tantly &s;uppo&s;es the perfect innocence of it's

Wherefore, let tho&s;e ju&s;t men who need no repentance, &s;it down conten|ted with their natural religion, or their refine|ments upon it; every true chri&s;tian, who is con|&s;cious to him&s;elf of his being a &s;inner, will e&s;|teem the revealed doctrine of a proper redempti|on, and of the perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s and atone|ment of the redeemer, and of the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ju&s;tification thro' faith in his blood, the very heart of chri&s;tianity, and will find the life of his &s;oul in the&s;e things.</P>
