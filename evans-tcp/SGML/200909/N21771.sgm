<P>SAGE old Solomon very wi&s;ely re|marked that there is <HI>a time for all things;</HI> and notwith&s;tanding his au|thority many will admit there &s;hould be a time for <HI>merriment.</HI> In this va|luable book, which is the very <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> and <HI>quinte&s;&s;ence</HI> of all mirth and jovi|ality, you will find much genuine wit, but nothing that can have a prejudicial influence upon your mind. It mat|ters little who you are, whether old or young, &s;narling or good-natured, pretty or ugly, crooked or &s;traight, dimple-chined or copper-no&s;ed, a tin|ker or a nabob; whoever you are it will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly excite your laugh|ter. For if your lips are even made of foal-leather, if your eyes fla&s;h the vengeance of Diogenes who lived in a tub, yet the paroxi&s;ms of giggling will &s;eize you as unawares as a bum-bai|liff; and if your ribs are not made out
<PB N="iv" REF="028656_0004_0FDA3D2FD5088198">of crow-bars you mu&s;t certainly put them a little in motion.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould you be re&s;olved to be hipp'd or in the dumps? Why &s;hould you proclaim war again&s;t your&s;elf and tear your wig or gouge out your eyes in a fit of de&s;peration, lea&s;t you &s;hould freeze or &s;tarve to death in this world? If you are in &s;uch a mopi&s;h habit you will here find a mo&s;t powerful anti|dote to cha&s;e away the fumes of me|lancholy. Then, if you are &s;ad do not &s;uffer misfortune to thru&s;t her pitchforks of de&s;pair into you, for, as the &s;ong &s;ays, as light heart and a thin pair of breeches will carry us through the world, brave boys.</P>
<P>As for the langui&s;hing nymph, who is up to her eye brows in love, and the deep &s;ighing &s;wain who&s;e heart is as full of holes as a riddle, they ought (for humanity's &s;ake) to be prevented from &s;labbering and &s;nivelling at their hard fate. Not an hundred apothe|caries &s;hops, not a regiment of phy|&s;icians,
<PB N="v" REF="028656_0005_0FDA3CFA3756EA78">inclu&s;ive of quack doctors in abundance, will do them half the &s;er|vice that can be effected by a peru&s;al of this book. If they &s;hould chance to be a little &s;queami&s;h at the &s;tomach, it will prove an excellent remedy for the &s;pleen, or the belly-ach of de&s;pair. In a word, the Editor has written and compiled it for the benefit of tho&s;e who may be di&s;po&s;ed to dance and &s;ing; to add glee to the &s;hort pittance of life, to improve the &s;ocial virtues; to heighten the charms of the big-bel|lied decanter, and to frighten haggard care and her wry faced train to a di&s;|tance. Depend upon it, Reader, that with a few gla&s;&s;es of wine in your head, a pretty la&s;s upon your knee and the <HI>"Fea&s;t of Merriment"</HI> in your hand, you will be a thou&s;and times happier than any monarch in the univer&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>THE FEAST OF MERRIMENT.</HEAD>
<P>A SCOTCH major, who had been &s;o &s;killful with his &s;word as to fight &s;everal duels with re|peated &s;ucce&s;s, but who, on account of his extreme de&s;ire for quarreling when a little intoxicated, and for his boa&s;ted courage, was de&s;erted and de|&s;pi&s;ed by his brother officers, came one evening into a large company. There happened to be pre&s;ent a Yankee, an officer of the &s;ame regiment which was then &s;tationed at Montreal. This Yankee related among other things the failure of a certain expedition in which he had the misfor|tune to be wounded. That was becau&s;e you were a <HI>ra&s;cally &s;et of cowards,</HI> ob&s;erved the &s;u|percilious major. You are a <HI>d&mdash;n'd liar,</HI> &s;ays the Yankee. The company &s;tared.

Yes, replied the Yankee, at any time and where you plea&s;e, only with this provi&s;o, that we me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> without &s;econds.

The next morning the Yankee

Before he had ad|vanced far, the Yankee, in an au&s;tere tone, bid him halt or he would blow his brains out. Upon which the major, &s;truck with amazement at this unexpected &s;tratagem, reluctantly obeyed, but ex|po&s;tulated with him upon the inju&s;tice of &s;uch an ungentle man like proceeding; the Yankee was implacable, determined to puni&s;h him for his pa&s;t conduct and for the abu&s;e he had him&s;elf receiv|ed.

'Tis ba&s;e, 'tis cowardly thus to di&s;arm me of all defence, &s;ays the major. No, replied his fellow combatant, I will deal honorably with you, there take my mu&s;ket (throwing it towards him) and defend your&s;elf. He, quite incen&s;ed, &s;eized the weapon with a mixture of exultation and precipi|tate vengeance, and ru&s;hing forward demanded his arms <HI>or he would blow him to h&mdash;l;</HI> blow and be d&mdash;n'd, &s;ays the Yankee. Provoked at &s;uch unparelled in&s;olence, in a fit of frenzy, he drew the trigger! But, alas, the mu&s;ket had <HI>not been charged!</HI> The glory of our braggadocia was &s;o &s;ullied, and his &s;eeling &s;o mortally wounded by this indignation, that he &s;old his commi&s;&s;ion and left the place.</P>

Mr. L&mdash;, a citizen of &s;ome note in New-York, was taken very ill of the gout, which in|&s;pired him with &s;uch dreadful apprehen&s;ions that he looked upon him&s;elf as already dead.

Oh, doctor, <HI>I'm a dead man, I'm a dead man!</HI> Well then, replied the doctor, I can do nothing for you, and in&s;tantly left the room. On his return &s;ome gentlemen enquired, how his patient was? How! why he is dead. Dead! &s;aid they, with the utmo&s;t &s;ur|prize. Yes, ab&s;olutely dead, replies the doctor. The &s;olemn news &s;oon gained circulation; howe|ver before long it was di&s;covered to be a fal&s;e report.

<P>Previous to the late American revolution, when di&s;tinction and rank were more fa&s;hionable than at pre&s;ent, there happened to be a &s;plendid ball in the city of New-York, which Mi&s;s T&mdash;and Mi&s;s M&mdash;attended. Mi&s;s T's father had been a rope-maker in the former part of his life, but having acquired an immen&s;e fortune at his trade, he quit bu&s;ine&s;s and lived in the mo&s;t magnificent &s;tyle. But the circum&s;tances of Mi&s;s M&mdash;'s father, who was a &s;addler, were &s;omewhat cir|cum&s;cribed, and he &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by the u&s;e of his hammer and awl. Mi&s;s T&mdash;, who had con|ceived an aver&s;ion again&s;t Mi&s;s M&mdash;, affected a &s;urprizing mortification that the augu&s;t per&s;on|ages of the a&s;&s;embly &s;hould be in&s;ulted by the pre&s;ence of a lady of &s;uch mean rank and fortune; in a fit of extreme indignation &s;he came up to Mi&s;s M&mdash; and in a whi&s;per &s;aid to her, Mi&s;s, I wi&s;h to &s;peak to you before one of the mana|gers. Mi&s;s M&mdash; con&s;ented, and when they came before the manager, Mi&s;s T&mdash; proclaimed in a loud voice, which in&s;tantly &s;ilenced the whole company, "Mr. Manager, I am a&s;toni&s;hed that you admit a per&s;on of her low rank (pointing to Mi&s;s M&mdash;) to di&s;grace the pre&s;ence of her &s;uperiors, and at any rate I think if &s;uch creatures cannot be excluded, they ought to be compelled to wear the badges of their profe&s;&s;ions."

<P>Two lawyers, who were as different in &s;tature as in ability, happened to be opponents in a cau&s;e.

<P><HI>The</HI> Par&s;on <HI>and the</HI> Fowls; <HI>or, the</HI> Maid <HI>too cunning for her</HI> Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>A rich old bachelor, a clergyman in the coun|try, having made choice of a pretty young maid to be his hou&s;e-keeper, had ordered upon a cer|tain Sunday, a couple of fowls to be got read for his dinner, that after he had given his congrega|tion a little Chri&s;tian con&s;olation at church, he might come home and refre&s;h his tired vitals with a dainty modicum; when the clerk and his loo|bily a&s;&s;i&s;tants had chimed all in, for about a quar|ter of an hour, away jogged the &s;hepherd to fod|der his &s;heep, and mea&s;ure his time by the hour gla&s;s, leaving his pretty hou&s;ekeeper to prepare
<PB N="45" REF="028656_0044_0FDA3D28B1872360">the cacklers again&s;t the acco&s;tomed time of his return.</P>
<P>The diligent maid, when &s;he thought her gho&s;t|ly ma&s;ter had been long enough exalted two de|grees above his clerk, to get about a quarter of an hour on the right &s;ide of his text, gue&s;&s;ed it a very proper time to lay down the fowls, which &s;he did accordingly. As the tidbits were running merrily round before a rou&s;ing fire, who &s;hould take the advantage of the par&s;on's ab&s;ence, but his hou&s;ekeeper's &s;weetheart, who by his plea&s;ant, comical hoity-toities, and other winning accom|pli&s;hments, had &s;o wriggled him&s;elf into her af|fections, that it is not unrea&s;onable to think he had as much command as her ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The maid having mi&s;taken the time of the day, happened to be a little too early with her cooke|ry, &s;o that the fowls were full ready before the par&s;on had given his hungry auditory leave to re|turn home to their puddings and dumplings. The &s;weetheart being a fellow of an incomparable &s;tomach, thought it a great pity, &s;uch good victu|als &s;hould be &s;poiled for want of eating, and very eagerly &s;olicited his loving Jug to &s;pare him one of the fowls to &s;top a little hole he had in his ap|petite, telling her one would be &s;ufficient for her ma&s;ter, and that &s;he had wit enough to contrive &s;ome &s;tory or other, hand&s;omely to excu&s;e the matter, and blind him from the true knowledge of what became of it.</P>
<P>The maid being willing to oblige her lover, who &s;he found was &s;o de&s;irous to oblige her upon all occa&s;ions, ventured to take up one to &s;ave the
<PB N="46" REF="028656_0045_0FDA3D5E7B5E2A78">longing of her &s;weetheart who being very well prepared for &s;uch a nice entertainment, gobbled it up with &s;uch expedition, that before his bene|factre&s;s had wound up the jack, he had not &s;o much as left the claws which the poor cockral u|&s;ed to &s;cratch the dunghill withal.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner di&s;patched his &s;weetheart's fir&s;t courte&s;y, but he began to be very importu|nate with her for the &s;econd, telling her an ex|cu&s;e was as ea&s;y made for both as for one, and that &s;he had as good be hanged for a &s;heep as a lamb; till at la&s;t, by adding a few melting ki&s;&s;es to his ravenous &s;olicitations, he prevailed upon her to draw the other off the &s;pit, that he might fini&s;h his meal by robbing the par&s;on of his Sunday's dinner.</P>
<P>The &s;econd bird being brought before him, he lo&s;t no time, but drove down the former with the latter, without any vi&s;ible abatement of either his &s;peed or of his appetite. When he had cleared the di&s;h, and wa&s;hed all down with a cup of the par&s;on's be&s;t beer, he took a thankful leave of his mi&s;tre&s;s, who now began to be at her wit's end how to excu&s;e the rudene&s;s &s;he had &s;o fooli&s;hly committed.</P>
<P>As &s;he was thus pondering with her&s;elf, who &s;hould &s;tep in but the par&s;on and a &s;tranger with him, who coming from another town to hear him preach, the par&s;on thought him&s;elf obliged to in|vite him home to dinner with him.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the old Levite conducted his gue&s;ts into the parlour, but he begged his pardon a minute and retired into another room to whet his knife upon the frame of an old table, which
<PB N="47" REF="028656_0046_0FDA3D29D54FA870">was always his cu&s;tom before dinner; the maid in a peck of fears and troubles took the advantage in the interim, and &s;tepping into the parlour, in a &s;trange &s;eeming &s;ort of di&s;order, frightens away her ma&s;ter's gue&s;t with a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tory, as fol|lows, viz. Lord, &s;ir, how came you to venture your&s;elf home with my ma&s;ter, at this time of day, when if you had known him, you might have ea&s;ily di&s;covered by his countenance, he is in one of his old freaks.&mdash;Why, what's the matter with him, &s;ays the country farmer, he was woundy ci|vil to me in the church-yard, and by all means would bring me home to dine with him. Alas, good &s;ir, replied the maid, whatever you do, let me advi&s;e you to make the be&s;t of your way out of the hou&s;e, for if you &s;tay, now he is in one of his frenzical humours, he will certainly g&mdash; you; and I dare &s;ay, he is whetting his knife for that purpo&s;e; he has lately &s;erved two or three &s;o al|ready, though they have had the di&s;cretion to keep it &s;ilent, becau&s;e they &s;hould not be laughed at.

<P>He had not been gone a minute, but in comes the par&s;on with his knife in his hand, and finds the maid &s;tamping and &s;torming, as if &s;he was ray|ing mad in the parlour, with an empty &s;ineared di&s;h upon the table, and his gue&s;t gone.

<P>The famous We&s;ton, of facetious memory, hav|ing borrowed the &s;um of five pounds, and failing in payment, the gentleman who had lent the mo|ney, took occa&s;ion indi&s;creetly to talk of it in the public coffee-hou&s;e, which obliged We&s;ton to take notice of it; &s;o that it came to a challange.

<P>At the commencement of the late war, the very women became de&s;irous to &s;ignalize the zeal they felt in their country's cau&s;e. At a meeting of the gentlewomen belonging to the county of Bri&s;tol, in Penn&s;ylvania, they made a large col|lection of money, to fit out a regiment rai&s;ing
