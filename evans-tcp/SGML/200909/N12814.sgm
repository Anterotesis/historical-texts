<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS, BRETHREN, and COUNTRYMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I am this day called to admini&s;ter the ordinance of bapti&s;m among you, in a way different from what you have been acquainted with, it is proper for me to give you our rea&s;ons for &s;o doing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this year began, the &s;pirit of God has been evidently and pow|erfully working, by his convincing, converting and comforting influences, upon many &s;ouls in Bridgewater. The per&s;on now baptized was Mr. Seth Howard, in his 78th year; and though &s;ome raged again&s;t it before, yet a large a&s;&s;embly that met behaved very decently.</NOTE>, e&s;pecially &s;ince this way has every where been &s;poken again&s;t, even &s;o much as to make &s;ome pious people &s;uppo&s;e, that we hold the virtue of the ordinance to be in much water; and that we are not only cruel to our own children, but al&s;o &s;o rigid as to exclude many good Chri&s;tians from our communion, only for their want of compliance with one particular mode; notwith&s;tanding the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "Neither cir|cumci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci&s;ion, but a new creature."</P>
<P>This, my friends, is a plain &s;pecimen of the conver|&s;ation about the&s;e matters, which has been received by tradition from our fathers; but whether it be any better than vain conver&s;ation, a brief &s;tating of the ca&s;e may enable you to judge. The faculty of &s;peech was given us for the more ea&s;y communication of our ideas to each other, for mutual benefit. But, after a long and tedious debate of old, the great giver of this faculty &s;aid, "Who is this that darkeneth coun&s;el by WORDS WITHOUT KNOW|LEDGE!" And one of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of rea&s;on and language in the Engli&s;h nation ob&s;erves, that the way of many di&s;putants, even with regard to the WORDS upon which their arguments turn, re&s;embles a trader, who, in ca&s;ting up his accounts, &s;hould take the figure 8, and call it &s;ometimes &s;even, and &s;ometimes nine, as would be&s;t &s;uit his advantage. Yea, that many expo&s;itors, both of divine and human laws, by the time they have done
<PB N="3" REF="016196_0003_0F9BD40EED18B168">explaining them, make the WORDS to mean either nothing at all, or what they plea&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Locke on human under&s;tanding, b. 3, c. 10, p. 5&mdash;12.</NOTE>. Which vain deceit God has expre&s;ly warned us again&s;t, as what he &s;aw would be u&s;ed, to impo&s;e ordinances upon us "after the doc|trines and commandments of men;" with a &s;how of wi&s;dom, though in reality only "to the &s;atisfying of the fle&s;h." Gal. vi. 12, Col. ii. 8, 22, 23. For remedy again&s;t which, he commands us to "hold fa&s;t the form of &s;ound words;" and to turn away from &s;uch as have "a form of godline&s;s, but deny the power thereof." The form is to be held fa&s;t "in faith and love, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." A form is a&s;&s;umed to cover tho&s;e who are lovers of their own &s;elves: Yea, "lovers of plea&s;ures more than lovers of God." 2 Tim. i. 13, and iii. 2&mdash;5. A form of man's in|vention often calls the natural offspring of profe&s;&s;ors, heirs of promi&s;e. The form calls them "children of wrath, even as others." Eph. ii. 3. Yea, the form &s;ays, "that which is born of the fle&s;h, is fle&s;h;&mdash;ye mu&s;t be born again." John iii. 6, 7. Compare the&s;e things with what the word of truth &s;ays of circumci&s;ion, and it will bring us directly to the ca&s;e in hand. Many believing Jews were not only zealous for the continuance of cir|cumci&s;ion to their children, but al&s;o to have the &s;ame impo&s;ed upon the Gentile converts. To whom therefore the apo&s;tle &s;aid, "In Je&s;us Chri&s;t neither circumci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci&s;ion, but faith which worketh by love&mdash;but a new creature. Circumci&s;ion is nothing, and uncircumci&s;ion is nothing, but the keep|ing of the commandments of God." Gal. v. 6, and vi. 15, 1 Cor. vii. 19. Once that was his command; and while it was &s;o, obedience thereto mu&s;t be yielded by every I&s;raelite, or el&s;e he mu&s;t be cut off from that church. But now that command is out of date, which made their attempt &s;till to obey it of no avail, to be nothing; yea, in &s;ome re&s;pects, wor&s;e than nothing. And how can any token of church-member&s;hip, that is founded upon the covenant of circumci&s;ion, be any better now than it was in the apo&s;tles days? For when many who were born in that covenant, and had received the token of it, came to the fir&s;t admini&s;trator of bapti&s;m, he &s;aid, "who hath
<PB N="4" REF="016196_0004_0F9BD4100ACFAF58">warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance; and think not to &s;ay within your&s;elves, we have Abraham to our father; for I &s;ay unto you, that God is able of the&s;e &s;tones to rai&s;e up children unto Abraham." Matt. iii. 7&mdash;9. And our Lord's commi&s;&s;ion to his mini&s;ters is, to "teach and bap|tize," to "preach the go&s;pel to every creature: He that believeth and is baptized &s;hall be &s;aved." Matt. xxviii. 19, Mark xvi. 15, 16. Which order of things they fol|lowed on the day of Penteco&s;t, when "they who gladly received the word were baptized.&mdash;And the Lord added to the church daily &s;uch as &s;hould be &s;aved." Acts ii. 41, 47. Or, as an excellent author renders it, "the &s;aved<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edwards on a right to &s;acraments, p. 53. Yet a noted mini&s;ter in Bo&s;ton has pre&s;umed to deny that &s;aving grace is a qualification, without which per&s;ons may not come to the Lord's table. And of the vi&s;ible king|dom of Chri&s;t he &s;ays. "The in&s;titutions of this kingdom are all of them &s;o contrived, as to be, at once, equally and powerfully adapted both to begin and carry on the work of &s;anctification in the &s;ouls of all that are members of it. The divinely appointed way, in which per&s;ons become members of the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t, is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ition, that, in order to their being &s;o, they mu&s;t be the &s;ubjects of &s;aving faith, or judged to be &s;o." Chauncy's five &s;ermons on breaking of bread, 1772, p. 95, 105, 106. This is one fruit of confounding the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian covenants together.</NOTE>." And this form, this order of things, appears in all their after proceedings. And the divine promi&s;e to the church, "that all her children &s;hould be taught of God," is ex|plained by our Saviour, as meaning &s;uch a teaching and learning as draws every man of them to "come unto him." I&s;ai. liv. 13, John vi. 45. We therefore would u&s;e every go&s;pel means to draw children and others to Chri&s;t, and then into his church; but know of no warrant for bring|ing them to bapti&s;m "before they come to Chri&s;t." Many will allow that this was nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t planting of Chri&s;tianity, who yet will have it, that the members of the Chri&s;tian church brought their infants afterwards to bapti&s;m upon their faith, becau&s;e they &s;ay they are in the &s;ame covenant of grace which was made with Abra|ham in Gen. xvii. But we ought to remember that Abraham had no warrant from that covenant to circumci&s;e any one but &s;uch as were born in his hou&s;e, or bought with
<PB N="5" REF="016196_0005_0F9BD410C5776618">his money. The fir&s;t warrant which was given to that church to admit &s;trangers by hou&s;holds, was on the day when they came out of Egypt. Exod. xii. 48. And the form of &s;ound words is expre&s;s, that Chri&s;t is mediator of a better covenant, that is, not according to the covenant which God made with I&s;rael on that day. The one he calls "the fir&s;t and the old covenant," the other the &s;econd and the new covenant, and &s;ays, "he taketh away the fir&s;t that he may e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;econd." Heb. viii. 6&mdash;13, and x. 9. And one of the plaine&s;t points of difference betwixt tho&s;e two covenants is this, that the fir&s;t took in great numbers that did "not know God, nor his forgiv|ing mercy;" the other requires that knowledge in every member, "from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t." Deut. xxix. 10&mdash;13, Heb. viii. 10&mdash;12. And though many would have it, that this di&s;tinction is only in the efficacy of the admini&s;trations, and not in the covenants; yet it is certain that the efficacy of the "covenant of circumci&s;ion" was the &s;ame to Abraham, as that of the new covenant is to believers now; as he looked by faith through that &s;ha|dow. Acts. vii. 8, Rom. iv. 11. And if men had not daringly taken away the&s;e names which the book of God calls the covenants by, and added thereto words of their own invention, this controver&s;y would doubtle&s;s have cea&s;ed long ago.</P>
<P>And had it not been for the like practice concerning the manner of bapti&s;m, we apprehend we &s;hould never have heard &s;prinkling called a mode of bapti&s;m, any more than we &s;hould have heard &s;prinkling called a mode of dipping: This being the very meaning of the word bapti&s;m<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Ru&s;&s;ell, in the Port&s;mouth di&s;pute, p. 105. And Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> body of divinity, vol. 3, p. 333.</NOTE> For the word of truth &s;ays, we are "buried by it, buried in it;" and all know that to be buried is to be covered. And the great de&s;ign of that go&s;pel in&s;ti|tution is well de&s;cribed by the before named excellent author, who &s;ays,</P>
<P>"That bapti&s;m, by which the primitive converts were admitted into the church, was u&s;ed as an exhibition and token of their being vi&s;ibly "regenerated, dead to &s;in, alive to God, having the old man crucified," being de|livered
<PB N="6" REF="016196_0006_0F9BD411D14A1620">from the reigning power of &s;in, being made free from &s;in, and become the &s;ervants of righteou&s;ne&s;s, tho&s;e &s;ervants of God that have their "fruit unto that holine&s;s who&s;e end is everla&s;ting life," as is evident by Rom. vi. throughout.&mdash;He don't mean, only, that their bapti&s;m laid them under &s;pecial obligations to the&s;e things, and was a mark and token of their engagement to be thus hereafter; but was de&s;igned as a mark, token and exhi|bition, of their being vi&s;ibly thus already<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edwards on a right to &s;acraments, p. 20.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>This is an exact de&s;cription of our &s;entiments concern|ing this matter, and mu&s;t we not act accordingly, for fear it &s;hould condemn the practice of others? We abhor the thoughts of interrupting the wor&s;hip of any who dif|fer from us; or of u&s;ing any &s;ort of violence, to enforce our &s;entiments upon them. And though there have been Bapti&s;ts formed into church &s;tate in this land for the&s;e 140 years, yet our adver&s;aries have been forced to go above 100 years further back, and over to a country 3300 miles off, in order to get any &s;uch thing to reproach us with, that ever was done under the Bapti&s;t name. And this mean and &s;candalous practice toward us was repeated in the Bo&s;ton Gazette, no longer ago than the fir&s;t day of la&s;t month. But that is &s;o far from being our ca&s;e, that in 1644 a law was made in Bo&s;ton, to bani&s;h any man out of their juri&s;diction, that &s;hould only oppo&s;e infant &s;prinkling, or that &s;hould depart from the place where any were going to admini&s;ter it. In 1651, two Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters were &s;eized, only for peaceably wor&s;hip|ing God with a Chri&s;tian brother at Lynn, and were im|pri&s;oned and fined at Bo&s;ton, where one of them was mo&s;t cruelly &s;courged. Four years after, a pious member of the church in Charle&s;town was convinced that he had no divine warrant to bring his child to bapti&s;m; yet was &s;till de&s;irous to continue in the communion of that church; but only for his refu&s;ing to bring his child, or to &s;tand up and look on when they &s;prinkled infants, they cen&s;ured and excluded him therefrom. And for his join|ing with others in forming the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, he was disfranchi&s;ed, fined, impri&s;oned and
<PB N="7" REF="016196_0007_0F9BD4124EDCCF40">bani&s;hed. And no tongue can de&s;cribe all the deceit and cruelty that Paedobapti&s;ts have been guilty of towards our denomination, from that time to this. No longer ago than the 26th of la&s;t June, the wor&s;hip of a peace|able number of Chri&s;tians, in this State, was violently interrupted, and a horrid mockery of this divine ordi|nance was committed, in order to prevent their acting in it according to their con&s;ciences.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The proofs of the former part of the&s;e facts may be &s;een in our Bapti&s;t hi&s;tory, p. 150, 216&mdash;237, 359, &amp;c.
<P>An account of this la&s;t affair was publi&s;hed Oct. 15, 1778, Pepperell's an&s;wer thereto on Nov. 12, and our reply on Dec. 3. All in the Bo&s;ton Independent Chronicle.</P></NOTE>. And the two great|e&s;t complaints that our opponents make again&s;t us at this day are, becau&s;e we refu&s;e tamely to yield to &s;uch burdens, as they are not willing to touch with one of their fingers.</P>
<P>I challenge their whole party to produce an in&s;tance, if they can, of their communing at the Lord's table with any per&s;on that they did not think was bapti&s;ed; yet they have no better ground to accu&s;e us of rigidne&s;s upon, than becau&s;e we refu&s;e to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Again, the greate&s;t plea for our pre&s;ent war again&s;t Britain, is becau&s;e &s;he claimed a power to tax us where we were not repre&s;ented; yet our opponents here have claimed and exerci&s;ed &s;uch a power over us for the&s;e 140 years. And they have no other colour for their accu&s;a|tion again&s;t our denomination, of di&s;obeying govern|ment, or di&s;turbing the peace of it, than our refu&s;al of any active obedience to that u&s;urpation, and our plainly expo&s;ing the evil thereof to the public. And had not the Britons as good a pretence to call the Americans rebels upon, as any here have for the above accu&s;ation again&s;t us? Nothing prolongs controver&s;y more, than a mi&s;-&s;tating and mi&s;repre&s;enting of the que&s;tion in de|bate. The word of truth plainly &s;peaks of tho&s;e who get into the Chri&s;tian church without &s;aving faith, as thieves who did not come in by the door, but that they crept in unawares. John x. 9, Gal. ii. 4, Jude iv. Therefore the que&s;tion in hand is not whether thieves do not &s;ome|times creep into hou&s;es, or into churches; but it is whe|ther when we &s;ee them we may con&s;ent with them, or
<PB N="8" REF="016196_0008_0F9BD4181FDD97C0">whether it is not our indi&s;pen&s;able duty to turn away from tho&s;e who do &s;o? P&s;al. l. 16, 18, 2d Tim. iii. 5, 6. Yea, and to attend clo&s;ely upon the means and ways that God has appointed, for the guarding his church again&s;t and purging it from all &s;uch evils. Matt. vii. 6, 15, 16, Luke vi. 42&mdash;45, Rom. x. 10, 1&s;t. Cor. v. 7&mdash;13. We are far from &s;uppo&s;ing the efficacy of bapti&s;m to lie in much or little water. It is wholly in obedience to God, and in his ble&s;&s;ing thereon. But how many are there of our accu&s;ers, who will &s;carcely allow that infants can be &s;aved without it? And I intreat you to con&s;ider what tendency it mu&s;t have, to tell per&s;ons that they were born in the covenant of grace, and that they had the &s;ame &s;ealed to them in their infancy. For it is mo&s;t cer|tain, that natural birth, and all that parents and mini|&s;ters can do for us, can never rai&s;e one &s;oul above the power of &s;elf-love; and what dreadful work has that principle lately made among us? It has plainly verified the words of HIM who &s;ays, "this know al&s;o, that in the la&s;t days perilous times &s;hall come; for men &s;hall be lovers of their own &s;elves, covetous, boa&s;ters, proud, bla&s;phemers, di&s;obedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, fal&s;e accu&s;ers, incontinent, fierce, de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of plea&s;ures more than lovers of God; having a form of godline&s;s, but de|nying the power thereof; from &s;uch turn away."</P>
<P>And as it is certain, that Chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t planted and was propagated through the world, for 300 years, by TRUTH and LOVE, without, and often again&s;t, the u&s;e of &s;ecular force; can the power thereof be more plainly denied in any way, than by declaring that natural birth and the doings of men can bring us into it, and that it would &s;oon fail if it was not &s;upported by tax and com|pul&s;ion?</P>
