<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE dignity of the &s;ubject of this little Trea|ti&s;e, not any per&s;ua&s;ion of its merits as a literary compo&s;ition, encourages me to offer it to your Lord&s;hip's patronage. The cau&s;e of freedom has always been found &s;ufficient, in every age and country, to attract the notice of the generous and humane; and it is therefore, in a more pe|culiar manner, worthy of the attention and fa|vour of a per&s;onage, who holds a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank in that illu&s;trious i&s;land, the very air of which has been determined, upon a late inve&s;|tigation of its laws, to be an antidote again&s;t &s;lavery. I feel a &s;atisfaction in the opportunity, which the publication of this treati&s;e offords me, of acknowledging your Lord&s;hip's civilities, which can only be equalled by the re&s;pect, with which I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the &s;ubject of the following work has fortunately become of late a topick of conver&s;ation, I cannot begin the preface in a manner more &s;atisfactory to the feelings of the benevolent reader, than by giving an ac|count of tho&s;e humane and worthy per&s;ons, who have endeavoured to draw upon it that &s;hare of the publick attention which it has obtained.</P>
<P>Among the well di&s;po&s;ed individuals, of different na|tions and ages, who have humanely exerted them&s;elves to &s;uppre&s;s the abject per&s;onal &s;lavery, introduced in the ori|ginal cultivation of the <HI>European</HI> colonies in the we&s;tern world, <HI>Bartholomew de las Ca&s;as,</HI> the pious bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiapa,</HI> in the fifteenth century, &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t. This amiable man, during his re&s;idence. in <HI>Spani&s;h America,</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected at the treatment which the mi&s;erable Indians underwent, that he returned to <HI>Spain,</HI> to make a publick remon&s;trance before the cele|brated emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, declaring, that heaven would one day call him to an account for tho&s;e cruelties, which he then had it in his power to prevent. The &s;peech which he made on the occa&s;ion, is now extant, and is a mo&s;t perfect picture of benevolence and piety.</P>
<P>But his intreaties, by the oppo&s;ition of avarice, were rendered ineffectual: and I do not find by any books which I have read upon the &s;ubject, that any other per|&s;on interfered till the la&s;t century, when <HI>Morgan Godwyn,</HI> a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> clergyman, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent age has al&s;o produced &s;ome zealous and able oppo&s;ers of the <HI>colonial</HI> &s;lavery. For about the mid|dle of the pre&s;ent century, <HI>John Woolman</HI> and <HI>Anthony Benezet,</HI> two re&s;pectable members of the religious &s;o|ciety called Quakers, devoted much of their time to the &s;ubject. The former travelled through mo&s;t parts of
<PB N="vi" REF="019561_0004_0FABFB7E79708B48"><HI>North America</HI> on foot, to hold conver&s;ations with the members of his own &s;ect, on the impiety of retaining tho&s;e in a &s;tate of involuntary &s;ervitude, who had never given them offence. The latter kept a free &s;chool at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> for the education of black people. He took every opportunity of pleading in their behalf. He publi&s;hed &s;everal treati&s;es again&s;t &s;lavery,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A De&s;cription of Guinea, with an Inquiry into the Ri&s;e and Pro|gre&s;s of the Slave Trade, &amp;c.&mdash;A Caution to Great Britain and her Colonies, in a &s;hort Repre&s;entation of the calamitous State of the en&s;laved Negroes in the Briti&s;h Dominons. Be&s;ides &s;everal &s;maller pieces.</NOTE> and gave an hearty proof of his attachment to the cau&s;e, by leaving the whole of his fortune in &s;upport of that &s;chool, to which he had &s;o generou&s;ly devoted his time and atten|tion when alive.</P>
<P>Till this time it does not appear, that any bodies of men had collectively intere&s;ted them&s;elves in endeavour|ing to remedy the evil. Not in the year 1754, the reli|gious &s;ociety, called Quakers, publickly te&s;tified their &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">They had cen&s;ured the <HI>African Trade</HI> in the year 1727, but had taken no publick notice of the <HI>colonial</HI> &s;lavery till this time.</NOTE> declaring, that <Q>to live in ea&s;e and plenty by the toil of tho&s;e, whom fraud and violence had put into their power, was neither con&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tianity nor common ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e &s;entiments, many of this &s;ociety immediately liberated their &s;laves; and though &s;uch a mea&s;ure appeared to be attended with con&s;iderable lo&s;s to the benevolent individuals, who unconditionally pre|&s;ented them with their freedom, yet they adopted it with plea&s;ure: nobly con&s;idering, that to po&s;&s;e&s;s a little, in an honourable way, was better than to po&s;&s;e&s;s much, through the medium of inju&s;tice. Their example was gradually followed by the re&s;t. A general emancipation of the &s;laves in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Quakers, at length took place; and &s;o effectually did they &s;erve the cau&s;e which they had undertaken, that they denied the claim of member&s;hip in their religious community, to all &s;uch
<PB N="vii" REF="019561_0005_0FABFB7F445953B8">as &s;hould hereafter oppo&s;e the &s;ugge&s;tions of ju&s;tice in this particular, either by retaining &s;laves in their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, or by being in any manner concerned in the &s;lave trade.</P>
<P>But though this mea&s;ure appeared, as has been ob|&s;erved before, to be attended with con&s;iderable lo&s;s to the benevolent individuals who adopted it, yet, as virtue &s;eldom fails of obtaining its reward, it became ultimate|ly beneficial. Many of the &s;laves, who were thus un|conditionally freed, returned without any &s;olicitation to their former ma&s;ters, to &s;erve them, at &s;tated wages, as free men. The work, which they now did, was found to be better done than before. It was found al&s;o, that a greater quantity was done in the &s;ame time. Hence le&s;s than the former number of labourers was &s;ufficient. From the&s;e, and a variety of other circum&s;tances, it ap|peared, that their plantations were con&s;iderably more profitable, when worked by free men, than when work|ed, as before, by &s;laves; and that they derived there|fore, contrary to their expectations, a con&s;iderable ad|vantage from their benevolence.</P>
<P>Animated by the example of the Quakers, the mem|bers of other &s;ects began to deliberate about adopting the &s;ame mea&s;ure. Some of tho&s;e of the church of England, of the Roman Catholicks, and of the Pre&s;|byterians and Independants, freed their &s;laves in <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania.</HI> It was agitated in the &s;ynod of the Pre&s;byte|ans, to oblige their members to liberate their &s;laves. The que&s;tion was negatived by a majority of but one per&s;on, as I am informed; and this oppo&s;ition &s;eemed to ari&s;e rather from a di&s;like to the attempt of forcing &s;uch a mea&s;ure upon the members of that community, than from any other con&s;ideration. I have the plea&s;ure of being credibly informed, that the manumi&s;&s;ion of &s;laves, or the employment of free men in the plantations, is now daily gaining ground in North America. Should &s;lavery be aboli&s;hed there, (and it is an event, which, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, we may rea&s;onably expect to be produced in time) let it be remembered, that the Quakers will have had the merit of its abolition.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="019561_0006_0FABFB7FF13BA340">
Nor have their brethren here been le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous in the cau&s;e. As there are happily no &s;laves in this country, &s;o they have not the had &s;ame opportunity of &s;hewing their benevolence by a general emancipation. They have not however omitted to &s;hew it as far as they have been able. At their religious meetings they have regu|larly inquired if any of their members are concerned in the iniquitous <HI>African</HI> trade. They have appointed a committee for obtaining every kind of information on the &s;ubject, with a view to its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, and, about three or four years ago, petitioned parliament on the occa&s;ion for their interference and &s;upport. I am &s;orry to add, that their benevolent application was ineffectual, and that the reformation of an evil, productive of con|&s;equences equally impolitick and immoral, and generally acknowledged to have long di&s;graced our national cha|racter, is yet left to the un&s;upported efforts of piety, morality and ju&s;tice, again&s;t intere&s;t, violence and op|pre&s;&s;ion; and the&s;e, I blu&s;h to acknowledge, too &s;trong|ly countenanced by the legi&s;lative authority of a coun|try, the ba&s;is of who&s;e government is <HI>liberty.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing can be more clearly &s;hewn, than that an in|exhau&s;tible mine of wealth is neglected in <HI>Africa,</HI> for the pro&s;ecution of this impious traffick; that, if proper mea&s;ures were taken, the revenue of this country might be greatly improved, its naval &s;trength increa&s;ed, its colonies in a more flouri&s;hing &s;ituation, the planters richer, and a trade, which is now a &s;cene of blood and de&s;olation, converted into one, which might be pro&s;e|cuted with <HI>advantage</HI> and <HI>honour.</HI></P>
<P>Such have been the exertions of the Quakers in the cau&s;e of humanity and virtue. They are &s;till pro&s;ecut|ing, as far as they are able, their benevolent de&s;ign; and I &s;hould &s;top here and prai&s;e them for thus continu|ing their humane endeavours, but that I conceive it to be unnece&s;&s;ary. They are acting con&s;i&s;tently with the principles of religion. They will find a reward in their own con&s;ciences; and they will receive more real plea|&s;ure from a &s;ingle reflection on their conduct, than they can po&s;&s;ibly experience from the prai&s;es of an ho&s;t of writers.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="019561_0007_0FABFB81527DB038">
In giving this &s;hort account of tho&s;e humane and worthy per&s;ons, who have endeavoured to re&s;tore to their fellow creatures the rights of nature, of which they had been unju&s;tly deprived, I &s;hould feel my&s;elf unju&s;t, were I to omit two zealous oppo&s;ers of the <HI>colo|nial</HI> tyranny, con&s;picuous at the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is Mr. <HI>Granville Sharp.</HI> This Gentleman has particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the cau&s;e of freedom. It is a notorious fact, that, but a few years &s;ince, many of the unfortunate black people, who had been brought from the colonies into this country, were &s;old in the metropolis to merchants and others, when their ma&s;ters had no farther occa&s;ion for their &s;ervices; though it was always under&s;tood that every per&s;on was free, as &s;oon as he landed on the Briti&s;h &s;hore. In con|&s;equence of this notion, the&s;e unfortunate black people, refu&s;ed to go to the new ma&s;ters, to whom they were con&s;igned. They were however &s;eized, and forcibly conveyed, under cover of the night, to &s;hips then lying in the <HI>Thames,</HI> to be retran&s;ported to the colonies, and to be delivered again to the planters as merchantable goods. The humane Mr. <HI>Sharpe,</HI> was the means of putting a &s;top to this iniquitous traffick. Whenever he gained information of people in &s;uch a &s;ituation, he cau&s;ed them to be brought on &s;hore. At a con&s;iderable expence he undertook their cau&s;e, and was in&s;trument|al in obtaining the famous decree in the ca&s;e of <HI>Somer|&s;ett,</HI> that as &s;oon as any per&s;on whatever &s;et his foot in this country, he came under the protection of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> laws, and was con&s;equently free. Nor did he inter|fere le&s;s honourably in that cruel and di&s;graceful ca&s;e, in the &s;ummer of the year 1781, when <HI>an hundred and thirty two</HI> negroes, in their pa&s;&s;age to the colonies, were thrown into the &s;ea alive, to defraud the underwriters; but his pious endeavours were by no means attended with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. To enumerate his many laud|able endeavours in the extirpation of tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion, would be to &s;well the preface into a volume: &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that he has written &s;everal books on the
<PB N="x" REF="019561_0008_0FABFB81EE745D50">&s;ubject, and one particularly, which he di&s;tingui&s;hes by the title of <HI>"A Limitation of &s;lavery."</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd is the <HI>Rev. James Ram&s;ay.</HI> This gentle|man re&s;ided for many years in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in the clerical office. He peru&s;ed all the colonial codes of law, with a view to find if there were any favourable clau&s;es, by which the grievances of &s;laves could be redre&s;&s;ed; but he was &s;everely di&s;appointed in his pur&s;uits. He publi&s;hed a treati&s;e, &s;ince his return to England, called <HI>An E&s;&s;ay on the Treatment and Conver&s;ion of African Slaves in the Briti&s;h Sugar Colonies,</HI> which I recommend to the peru&s;al of the humane reader. This work reflects great prai&s;e upon the author, &s;ince, in order to be of &s;ervice to this &s;ingularly oppre&s;&s;ed part of the human &s;pecies, he compiled it at the expence of forfeiting that friend|&s;hip, which he had contracted with many in tho&s;e parts, during a &s;eries of years, and at the hazard, as I am cre|dibly informed, of &s;uffering much in his private pro|perty, as well as of &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to the ill will and per&s;ecution of numerous individuals.</P>
<P>This E&s;&s;ay <HI>on the Treatment and Conver&s;ion of African Slaves,</HI> contains &s;o many important truths on the colo|nial &s;lavery, and has come &s;o home to the planters, (be|ing written by a per&s;on who has a thorough knowledge of the &s;ubject) as to have occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable alarm. Within the la&s;t eight months, two publications have expre&s;sly appeared again&s;t it. One of them is in|titled "<HI>Cur&s;ory Remarks</HI> on Mr. Ram&s;ay's E&s;&s;ay;" the other an <HI>Apology for Negroe Salvery.</HI>" On each of the&s;e I am bound, as writing on the &s;ubject, to make a few remarks.</P>
<P>The <HI>cur&s;ory remarker</HI> in&s;inuates, that Mr. Ram&s;ay's account of the treatment is greatly exaggerated, if not wholly fal&s;e. To this I &s;hall make the following reply. I have the honour of knowing &s;everal di&s;intere&s;ted gen|tlemen, who have been acquainted with the We&s;t Indi|an i&s;lands for years. I call them di&s;intere&s;ted, becau&s;e they have neither had a concern in the <HI>African</HI> trade, nor in the <HI>colonial</HI> &s;lavery: and I have heard the&s;e unani|mou&s;ly
<PB N="xi" REF="019561_0009_0FABFB87765702C0">a&s;&s;ert, that Mr. <HI>Ram&s;ay</HI>'s account is &s;o far from being exaggerated, or taken from the mo&s;t dreary pic|tures that he could find, that it is ab&s;olutely below the truth; that he mu&s;t have omitted many in&s;tances of cru|elty, which he had &s;een him&s;elf; and that they only wondered, how he could have written with &s;o much mo|deration upon the &s;ubject. They allow the <HI>Cur&s;ory Re|marks</HI> to be excellent as a compo&s;ition, but declare that it is perfectly devoid of truth.</P>
<P>But the <HI>cur&s;ory remarker</HI> does not depend &s;o much on the circum&s;tances which he has advanced, (nor can he, &s;ince they have no other exi&s;tence than in his own brain) as on the in&s;trument <HI>detraction.</HI> This he has u&s;ed with the utmo&s;t virulence through the whole of his pub|lication, artfully &s;uppo&s;ing, that if he could bring Mr. <HI>Ram&s;ay's</HI> reputation into di&s;pute, his work would fall of cour&s;e, as of no authenticity. I &s;ubmit this &s;imple que|&s;tion to the reader. When a writer, in attempting to &s;ilence a publication, attacks the character of its author, rather than the principles of the work it&s;elf, is it not a proof that the work it&s;elf is unque&s;tionable, and that this writer is at a lo&s;s to find an argument again&s;t it?</P>
<P>But there is &s;omething &s;o very ungeneous in this mode of replication, as to require farther notice. For if this is the mode to be adopted in literary di&s;putes, what writer can be &s;afe? Or who is there, that will not be deterred from taking up his pen in the cau&s;e of vir|tue? There are circum&s;tances in every per&s;on's life, which, if given to the publick in a malevolent manner, and without explanation, might e&s;&s;entially injure him in the eyes of the world; though, were they explained, they would be even reputable. The <HI>cur&s;ory remarker</HI> has adopted this method of di&s;pute; but Mr. <HI>Ram&s;ay</HI> has explained him&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of all parties, and has refuted him in every point. The name of this <HI>cur&s;ory remarker</HI> is <HI>Tobin:</HI> a name, which I feel my&s;elf obliged to hand down with dete&s;tation, as far as I am able; and with an hint to future writers, that they will do them&s;elves more credit, and &s;erve more effectually the cau&s;e which they undertake, if on &s;uch occa&s;ions
<PB N="xii" REF="019561_0010_0FABFB8AE44A8318">they attack the work, rather than the character of the writer, who affords them a &s;ubject for their lucubrati|ons.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only circum&s;tance, which induces me to take &s;uch particular notice of the <HI>Cur&s;ory Remarks.</HI> I feel it incumbent upon me to re&s;cue an injured per&s;on from the cruel a&s;per&s;ions that have been thrown upon him, as I have been repeatedly informed by tho&s;e, who have the plea&s;ure of his acquaintance, that his character is irreproachable. I am al&s;o intere&s;ted my&s;elf. For if &s;uch detraction is pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, my own repu|tation, and not my work, may be attacked by an ano|nymous hireling in the cau&s;e of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apology for Negroe Slavery</HI> is almo&s;t too de&s;pica|ble a compo&s;ition to merit a reply. I have only there|fore to ob&s;erve, (as is frequently the ca&s;e in a bad cau&s;e, or where writers do not confine them&s;elves to truth) that the work refutes it&s;elf. This writer, &s;peaking of the &s;lave-trade, a&s;&s;erts, that people are never kidnapped on the coa&s;t of <HI>Africa.</HI> In &s;peaking of the treatment of &s;laves, he a&s;&s;erts again, that it is of the very milde&s;t nature, and that they live in the mo&s;t comfortable and happy manner imaginable. To prove each of his a&s;&s;er|tions, he propo&s;es the following regulations. That the <HI>&s;tealing</HI> of &s;laves from <HI>Africa</HI> &s;hould be felony. That the <HI>premeditated murder</HI> of a &s;lave by any per&s;on on board, &s;hould come under the &s;ame denomination. That when &s;laves arrive in the colonies, lands &s;hould be al|lotted for their provi&s;ions, <HI>in proportion to their number,</HI> or commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould &s;ee that a <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> quantity of <HI>&s;ound whole&s;ome</HI> provi&s;ions is purcha&s;ed. That they &s;hould not work on <HI>Sundays</HI> and <HI>other</HI> holy-days. That extra labour, or <HI>night-work, out of crop,</HI> &s;hould be pro|hibited. That a <HI>limited number</HI> of &s;tripes &s;hould be in|flicted upon them. That they &s;hould have <HI>annually</HI> a &s;uit of clothes. That old infirm &s;laves &s;hould be <HI>properly cared for,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;Now it can hardly be conceived, that if this author had tried to injure his cau&s;e, or contra|dict him&s;elf, he could not have done it in a more effec|tual manner, than by this propo&s;al of the&s;e &s;alutary
<PB N="xiii" REF="019561_0011_0FABFB8E9A1B22D0">regulations. For to &s;ay that &s;laves are honourably ob|tained on the coa&s;t; to &s;ay that their treatment is of the milde&s;t nature, and yet to propo&s;e the above-mentioned regulations as nece&s;&s;ary, is to refute him&s;elf more clear|ly, than I confe&s;s my&s;elf to be able to do it: and I have only to reque&s;t, that the regulations propo&s;ed by this writer, in the defence of &s;lavery, may be con&s;idered as &s;o many proofs of the a&s;&s;ertions contained in my own work.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e my account with an ob&s;ervation, which is of great importance in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Of all the publications in favour of the &s;lave-trade, or the &s;ub&s;e|quent &s;lavery in the colonies, there is not one, which has not been written, either by a chaplain to the African factories, or by a merchant, or by a planter, or by a per&s;on who&s;e intere&s;t has been connected in the cau&s;e which he has taken upon him to defend. Of this de|&s;cription are Mr. <HI>Tobin,</HI> and the <HI>Apologi&s;t for Negroe Sla|very.</HI> While on the other hand tho&s;e, who have had as competent a knowledge of the &s;ubject, but not the <HI>&s;ame intere&s;t</HI> as them&s;elves, have unanimou&s;ly condemned it; and many of them have written their &s;entiments upon it, at the hazard of creating an innumerable ho&s;t of enemies, and of being &s;ubjected to the mo&s;t malignant oppo&s;ition. Now, which of the&s;e are we to believe on the occa&s;ion? Are we to believe tho&s;e, who are parties concerned, who are intere&s;ted in the practice?&mdash;But the que&s;tion does not admit of a di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Concerning my own work, it &s;eems proper to ob&s;erve, that when the original Latin Di&s;&s;ertation, as the title page expre&s;&s;es, was honoured by the Univer&s;ity of Cam|bridge with the fir&s;t of their annual prizes for the year 1785, I was waited upon by &s;ome gentlemen of re&s;pect|ability and con&s;equence, who reque&s;ted me to publi&s;h it in Engli&s;h. The only objection which occurred to me was this; that having been prevented, by an attention to other &s;tudies, from obtaining that critical knowledge of my own language, which was nece&s;&s;ary for an Eng|li&s;h compo&s;ition, I was fearful of appearing before the publick eye: but that, as they flattered me with the
<PB N="xiv" REF="019561_0012_0FABFB9091B1A5D8">hope, that the publication of it might be of u&s;e, I would certainly engage to publi&s;h it, if they would allow me to po&s;tpone it for a little time, till I was more in the habit of writing. They replied, that as the publick attention was now excited to the ca&s;e of the unfortunate <HI>Africans,</HI> it would be &s;erving the cau&s;e with double the effect, if it were to be publi&s;hed within a few months. This ar|gument prevailed. Nothing but this circum&s;tance could have induced me to offer an Engli&s;h compo&s;ition to the in&s;pection of an ho&s;t of criticks: and I tru&s;t therefore that this circum&s;tance will plead much with the benevo|lent reader, in favour of tho&s;e faults, which he may find in the pre&s;ent work.</P>
<P>Having thus promi&s;ed to publi&s;h it, I was for &s;ome time doubtful from which of the copies to tran&s;late. There were two, the original, and an abridgement. The latter (as the&s;e academical compo&s;itions are gene|rally of a certain length) was that which was &s;ent down to Cambridge, and honoured with the prize. I was determined however, upon cou&s;ulting with my friends, to tran&s;late from the former. This has been faithfully done with but few<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The in&s;tance of the <HI>Dutch</HI> coloni&s;ts at the Cape, in the fir&s;t part of the E&s;&s;ay; the de&s;cription of an African battle, in the &s;e|cond; and the poetry of a negroe girl in the third, are the only con&s;iderable additions that have been made.</NOTE> additions. The reader will pro|bably perceive the Latin idiom in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of the work, though I have endeavoured, as far as I have been able, to avoid it. And I am &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;advantages under which it mu&s;t yet lie, as a tran&s;lation, that I wi&s;h I had written upon the &s;ubject, without any reference at all to the original copy.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be a&s;ked, from what authority I have collected tho&s;e facts, which relate to the colonial &s;lavery. I reply, that I have had the means of the very be&s;t of information on the &s;ubject; having the plea&s;ure of being acquainted with many, both in the naval and military departments, as well as with &s;everal others, who have been long acquainted with <HI>America</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indian</HI>
<PB N="xv" REF="019561_0013_0FABFB9143951188">i&s;lands. The facts therefore which I have related, are compiled from the di&s;intere&s;ted accounts of the&s;e gentle|men, all of whom, I have the happine&s;s to &s;ay, have coincided, in the minute&s;t manner, in their de&s;criptions. It mu&s;t be remarked too, that they were compiled, not from what the&s;e gentlemen heard, while they were re&s;i|dent in tho&s;e parts, but from what they actually <HI>&s;aw.</HI> Nor has a &s;ingle in&s;tance been taken from any book whatever upon the &s;ubject, except that from <HI>Con&s;iderati|ons &s;ur la Colonie de St. Dominigue,</HI> in the latter part of Chap. ix, and this book was publi&s;hed in <HI>France,</HI> in the year 1777, by <HI>authority.</HI></P>
<P>I have now the plea&s;ure to &s;ay, that the accounts of the&s;e di&s;intere&s;ted gentlemen, whom I con&s;ulted on the occa&s;ion, are confirmed by all the books which I have ever peru&s;ed upon &s;lavery, except tho&s;e which have been written by <HI>merchants, planters, &amp;c.</HI> They are confirm|ed by Sir <HI>Hans Sloane's</HI> Voyage to Barbadoes; <HI>Griffith Hughes's</HI> Hi&s;tory of the &s;ame i&s;land, printed 1750; an Account of North America, by <HI>Thomas Jefferies,</HI> 1761; all <HI>Benezet's</HI> works, &amp;c. &amp;c. and particularly by Mr. <HI>Ram&s;ay's</HI> E&s;&s;ay on the Treatment and Conver&s;ion of the African Slaves in the Briti&s;h Sugar Colonies; a work which is now firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, I may add, in a very extraordinary manner, in con&s;equence of the con|trover&s;y which this gentleman has &s;u&s;tained with the <HI>Cur&s;ory Remarker,</HI> by which &s;everal facts which were mentioned in the original copy of my own work, before the controver&s;y began, and which had never appeared in any work upon the &s;ubject, have been brought to light. Nor has it received le&s;s &s;upport from a letter, publi&s;hed only la&s;t week, from Capt. J. S. Smith, of the Royal Navy, to the Rev. Mr. Hill; on the former of whom too high encomiums cannot be be&s;towed, for &s;tanding forth in that noble and di&s;intere&s;ted manner, in behalf of an injured character.</P>
<P>I have now only to &s;olicit the reader again, that he will make a favourable allowance for the pre&s;ent work, not only from tho&s;e circum&s;tances which I have menti|oned, but from the con&s;ideration, that only two months
<PB N="xvi" REF="019561_0014_0FABFB9209922A30">are allowed by the Univer&s;ity for the&s;e their annual compo&s;itions. Should he however be unpropitious to my reque&s;t, I mu&s;t con&s;ole my&s;elf with the reflection, (a reflection that will always afford me plea&s;ure, even amid&s;t the cen&s;ures of the great,) that by undertaking the cau&s;e of the unfortunate <HI>Africans,</HI> I have under|taken, as far as my abilities would permit, the cau&s;e of injured innocence.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE SLAVERY and COMMERCE OF THE HUMAN SPECIES. IN THREE PARTS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I. THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN civilized, as well as barbarous nations, have been found, through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, uniformly to concur in the &s;ame cu&s;toms, there &s;eems to ari&s;e a pre&s;umption, that &s;uch cu&s;toms are not only eminently u&s;eful, but are &s;ounded al&s;o on the princi|ples of ju&s;tice. Such is the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to <HI>Slavery:</HI> it has had the concurrence of all the nations, which hi&s;|tory has recorded, and the repeated practice of ages from the remote&s;t antiquity, in its favour. Here then is an argument, deduced from the general con&s;ent and arreement of mankind, in favour of the propo&s;ed &s;ub|ject: but alas! when we reflect that the people, thus re|duced to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, have had the &s;ame feelings
<PB N="22" REF="019561_0019_0FABFB95C226FEB0">with our&s;elves; when we reflect that they have had the &s;ame propen&s;ities to plea&s;ure, and the &s;ame aver&s;ions from pain; another argument &s;eems immediately to ari&s;e in op|po&s;ition to the former, deduced from our own feelings and that divine &s;ympathy, which nature has implanted in our brea&s;ts, for the mo&s;t u&s;eful and generous of pur|po&s;es. To a&s;certain the truth therefore, where two &s;uch oppo&s;ite &s;ources of argument occur; where the force of cu&s;tom pleads &s;trongly on the one hand, and the feelings of humanity on the other; it is a matter of much import|tance, as the diginity of human nature is concerned, and the rights and liberties of mankind will be involved in its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary, before this point can be determin|ed, to con&s;ult the Hi&s;tory of Slavery, and to lay before the reader, in as conci&s;e a manner as po&s;&s;ible, a general view of it from its earlie&s;t appearance to the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, whom we &s;hall mention here to have been reduced to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, may be comprehended in that cla&s;s, which is u&s;ually denominated the <HI>Mercena|ry.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ted of free-born citizens, who, from the various contingencies of fortune, had become &s;o poor, as to have recour&s;e for their &s;upport to the &s;ervice of the rich. Of this kind were tho&s;e, both among the Egyp|tians and the Jews, who are recorded in the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is, Ch. 47. Leviticus xxv. v. 39.40.</NOTE> &s;acred writings.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Thetes</HI> appear very early in the Grecian Hi&s;tory. Od. Ho|mer. &Dgr;. 642.</NOTE> The Grecian <HI>Thetes</HI> al&s;o were of this di&s;crip|tion, as well as tho&s;e among the Romans, from whom the cla&s;s receives its appellation, the<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The mention of the&s;e is frequent among the cla&s;&s;ics; they were called in general <HI>mercenarii,</HI> from the circum&s;tances of their <HI>hire,</HI> as <Q>quibus, non mal&egrave; praecipiunt, qui ita jubent uti, ut <HI>mercenariis,</HI> operam exigendam, ju&s;ta p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">oebenda. Cicero de off.</Q> But they are &s;ometimes mentioned in the law books by the name of <HI>liberi,</HI> from the circum&s;tances of their <HI>birth,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the <HI>alieni,</HI> or foreigners, as Ju&s;tinian. D. 7.8.4.&mdash;Id. 21.1.25. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Mercenarii.</HI></P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve of the above-mentioned, that their &s;ituation was in many in&s;tances &s;imilar to that of our own
<PB N="23" REF="019561_0020_0FABFB967B2C25C8">&s;ervants. There was an expre&s;s contract between the parties: they could, mo&s;t of them, demand their di&s;|charge, if they were ill u&s;ed by their re&s;pective ma&s;ters; and they were treated therefore with more humanity than tho&s;e, whom we u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;h in our language by the appellation of <HI>Slaves.</HI></P>
<P>As this cla&s;s of &s;ervants was compo&s;ed of men, who had been reduced to &s;uch a &s;ituation by the contingences of fortune, and not by their own mi&s;conduct; &s;o there was another among the ancients, compo&s;ed entirely of tho&s;e, who had &s;uffered the lo&s;s of liberty from their own imprudence. To this cla&s;s may be reduced the Grecian <HI>Prodigals,</HI> who were detained in the &s;ervice of their cre|ditors, till the fruits of their labour were equivalent to their debts; the <HI>delinquents,</HI> who were &s;entenced to the oar; and the German <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> as mentioned by Ta|citus, who were &s;o immoderately charmed with gaming, as, when every thing el&s;e was gone, to have &s;taked their liberty and their very &s;elves. "The lo&s;er," &s;ays he, <Q>goes into a voluntary &s;ervitude, and though younger and &s;tronger than the per&s;on with whom he played, patiently &s;uffers him&s;elf to be bound and &s;old. Their per&s;everance in &s;o bad a cu&s;tom is &s;tiled honour.&mdash; The &s;laves, thus obtained, are immediately exchanged away in commerce, that the winner may get rid of the &s;candal of his victory.</Q></P>
<P>To enumerate other in&s;tances, would be unnece&s;&s;ary: it will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ervants of this cla&s;s were in a far more wretched &s;ituation, than tho&s;e of the former; their drudgery was more inten&s;e; their treatment more &s;evere; and there was no retreat at plea|&s;ure, from the frowns and la&s;hes of their de&s;potick ma|&s;ters.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed this, we may now proceed to a gene|ral divi&s;ion of &s;lavery, into <HI>voluntary</HI> and <HI>involuntary.</HI> The <HI>voluntary</HI> will comprehend the two cla&s;&s;es, which we have already mentioned; for, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, there was a <HI>contract,</HI> founded on <HI>con&s;ent;</HI> and in the &s;e|cond, there was a <HI>choice</HI> of engaging or not in tho&s;e practices, the known con&s;equences of which were &s;ervi|tude.
<PB N="24" REF="019561_0021_0FABFB9740D10BA0">The <HI>involuntary,</HI> on the other hand, will compre|hend tho&s;e, who were forced, without any &s;uch <HI>condition</HI> or <HI>choice,</HI> into a &s;ituation, which as it tended to degrade a part of the human &s;pecies, and to cla&s;s it with the bru|tal, mu&s;t have been, of all human &s;ituations, the mo&s;t wretched and in&s;upportable. The&s;e are they, whom we &s;hall con&s;ider &s;oley in the pre&s;ent work. We &s;hall there|fore take our leave of the former, as they were mention|ed only, that we might &s;tate the que&s;tion with greater accuracy, and be the better enabled to reduce it to its proper limits.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t that will be mentioned, of the <HI>involuntary,</HI> were <HI>pri&s;oners of war.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Xenoph. L. 7. fin.</NOTE> <Q>It was a law, e&s;tabli&s;hed from time immemorial among the nations of antiquity, to oblige tho&s;e to undergo the &s;everities of &s;ervitude, whom victory had thrown into their hands.</Q> Con|formably with this, we find all the Ea&s;tern nations unani|mous in the practice. The &s;ame cu&s;tom prevailed among the people of the We&s;t; for as the Helots became the &s;laves of the Spartans, from the right of conque&s;t only, &s;o pri&s;oners of war were reduced to the &s;ame &s;ituation by the re&s;t of the inhabitants of Greece. By the &s;ame principles that actuated the&s;e, were the Romans al&s;o in|fluenced. Their Hi&s;tory will confirm the fact: for how many cities are recorded to have been taken; how many armies to have been vanqui&s;hed in the field, and the wretched &s;urvivors, in both in&s;tances, to have been doomed to &s;ervitude? It remains only now to ob&s;erve, in &s;hewing this cu&s;tom to have been univer&s;al, that all tho&s;e nations which a&s;&s;i&s;ted in overturning the Roman Empire, though many and various, adopted the &s;ame mea&s;ures; for we find it a general maxim in their polity, that whoever &s;hould fall into their hands as a pri&s;oner of war, &s;hould immediately be reduced to the condition of a &s;lave.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="019561_0022_0FABFB98BB4CD4F8">
It may here, perhaps, be not unworthy of remark, that the <HI>involuntary</HI> were of greater antiquity than the <HI>voluntary</HI> &s;laves. The latter are fir&s;t mentioned in the time of Pharaoh: they could have ari&s;en only in a &s;tate of &s;ociety; when property, after its divi&s;ion, had become &s;o unequal, as to multiply the wants of individuals; and when government, after its e&s;tabli&s;hment, had given &s;e|curity to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by the puni&s;hment of crimes.&mdash; Whereas the former &s;eem to be dated with more propri|ety from the days of Nimrod; who gave ri&s;e probably to that in&s;eparable idea of <HI>victory</HI> and <HI>&s;ervitude,</HI> which we find among the nations of antiquity, and which has ex|i&s;ted uniformly &s;ince, in one country or another, to the pre&s;ent day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>"Proud Nimrod fir&s;t the bloody chace began,</L>

<P>But it was not victory alone, or any pre&s;uppo&s;ed right, founded in the damages of war, that afforded a pretence for invading the liberties of mankind: the honourable light, in which <HI>piracy</HI> was con&s;idered in the uncivilized ages of the world, contributed not a little to the <HI>&s;lavery</HI> of the human &s;pecies. Piracy had a very early beginning. "The Grecians,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thucydides. L. 1. &s;ub initio.</NOTE> &s;ays Thucydides, <Q>in their primi|tive "&s;tate, as well as the contemporary barbarians, who "inhabited the &s;ea coa&s;ts and i&s;lands, gave them&s;elves "wholly to it; it was, in &s;hort, their only profe&s;&s;ion and &s;upport.</Q> The writings of Homer are &s;ufficient of them&s;elves to e&s;tabli&s;h this account. They &s;hew it to have been a common practice at &s;o early a period as that of the Trojan war; and abound with many lively de|&s;criptions
<PB N="26" REF="019561_0023_0FABFB997508EF50">of it, which, had they been as groundle&s;s as they are beautiful, would have frequently &s;pared the &s;igh of the reader of &s;en&s;ibility and reflection.</P>

<P>In the latter, individuals only were concerned, and the emolument was their own. The&s;e landed from their &s;hips, and, going up into the country, concealed them&s;elves in the woods and thickets; where they waited every op|portunity of catching the unfortunate &s;hepherd or hu&s;|bandman alone. In this &s;ituation they &s;allied out upon him, dragged him on board, conveyed him to a foreign market. and &s;old him for a &s;lave.</P>
<P>To this kind of piracy Uly&s;&s;es alludes, in oppo&s;ition to the former, which he had been ju&s;t before mentioning, in his que&s;tion to Eumoeus.</P>

<P>But no picture, perhaps, of this mode of depredation, is equal to that, with which<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Xenoph. L. 6. &s;ub initio.</NOTE> Xenophon pre&s;ents us in the &s;imple narrative of a dance. He informs us that the Grecian army had concluded a peace with the Paphlagoni|ans, and that they entertained their emba&s;&s;adors in con|&s;equence with a banquet, and the exhibition of various feats of activity. "When the Thracians," &s;ays he, had <Q>performed the parts allotted them in this entertainment, &s;ome Aenianian and Magnetian &s;oldiers ro&s;e up, and,
<PB N="27" REF="019561_0024_0FABFBA1A0842860">accoutred in their proper arms, exhibited that dance, which is called <HI>Karpoea.</HI> The figure of it is thus. One of them, in the character of an hu&s;bandman, is &s;een to till his land, and is ob&s;erved, as he drives his plough, to look frequently behind him, as if apprehen&s;ive of danger. Another immediately appears in &s;ight, in the character of a robber. The hu&s;bandman, having &s;een him previou&s;ly advancing, &s;natches up his arms. A battle en&s;ues before the plough. The whole of this performance is kept in perfect time with the mu&s;ick of the flute. At length the robber, having got the bet|ter of the hu&s;bandman, binds him, and drives him off with his team. Sometimes it happens that the hu&s;|bandman &s;ubdues the robber: in this ca&s;e the &s;cene is only reveried, as the latter is then bound and driven off by the former.</Q></P>
<P>It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that this dance was a repre&s;entation of the general manners of men, in the more uncivilized ages of the world; &s;hewing that the hu&s;bandman and &s;hepherd lived in continual alarm, and that there were people in tho&s;e ages, who derived their plea&s;ures and fortunes from <HI>kidnapping</HI> and <HI>en&s;laving</HI> their fellow creatures.</P>
<P>We may now take notice of a circum&s;tance in this nar|ration, which will lead us to a review of our fir&s;t a&s;&s;erti|on on this point, <Q>that the honourable light, in which <HI>piracy</HI> was con&s;idered in the times of barbari&s;in, con|tributed not a little to the <HI>&s;lavery</HI> of the human &s;pe|cies.</Q> The robber is repre&s;ented here as frequently defeated in his attempts, and as reduced to that deplora|ble &s;ituation, to which he was endeavouring to bring another. This &s;hews the frequent difficulty and danger of his undertakings: people would not tamely re&s;ign their lives or liberties, without a &s;truggle. They were &s;ome|times prepared; were &s;uperior often, in many points of view, to the&s;e invaders of their liberty; there were an hundred accidental circum&s;tances frequently in their favour. The&s;e adventurers therefore required all the &s;kill, &s;trength, agility, valour, and every thing, in &s;hort, that may be &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute heroi&s;m, to conduct
<PB N="28" REF="019561_0025_0FABFBA1C0F63F10">them with &s;ucce&s;s. Upon this idea piratical expeditions fir&s;t came into repute, and their frequency afterwards, together with the danger and fortitude, that were in&s;epara|bly connected with them, brought them into &s;uch credit among the barbarous nations of antiquity, that of all human profe&s;&s;ions, piracy was the mo&s;t honourable.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thucydides. L. 1. &s;ub initio. Sextus Empiricus. Schol. &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>The notions then, which were thus annexed to pira|tical expeditions, did not fail to produce tho&s;e con&s;e|quences, which we have mentioned before. They af|forded an opportunity to the views of avarice and ambition, to conceal them&s;elves under the ma&s;k of vir|tue. They excited a &s;pirit of enterprize, of all others the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible, as it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the &s;tronge&s;t prin|ciples of action, emolument and honour. Thus could the vile&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions be gratified with impunity. Peo|ple were robbed, &s;tolen, murdered, under the pretended idea that the&s;e were reputable adventures: every enor|mity in &s;hort was committed, and dre&s;&s;ed up in the ha|biliments of honour.</P>
<P>But as the notions of men in the le&s;s barbarous ages, which followed, became more corrected and refined, the practice of piracy began gradually to di&s;appear. It had hitherto been &s;upported on the grand columns of <HI>emolument</HI> and <HI>honour.</HI> When the latter therefore was removed, it received a con&s;iderable &s;hock; but, alas! it had &s;till a pillar for its &s;upport! <HI>avarice,</HI> which exi&s;ts in all &s;tates, and which is ready to turn every invention to its own ends, &s;trained hard for its pre&s;ervation. It had been produced in the ages of barbari&s;m; it had been pointed out in tho&s;e ages as lucrative, and under this notion it was continued. People were &s;till &s;tolen; many were intercepted (&s;ome, in their pur&s;uits of plea|&s;ure, others, in the di&s;charge of their &s;everal occupati|ons) by their own countrymen; who previou&s;ly laid in wait for them, and &s;old them afterwards for &s;laves; while others &s;eized by merchanis, who traded on the different coa&s;ts, were torn from their friends and connections,

<P>It will be proper to &s;ay &s;omething here concerning the &s;ituation of the unfortunate men, who were thus doomed to a life of &s;ervitude. To enumerate their va|rious employments, and to de&s;cribe the mi&s;eries which they endured in con&s;equence, either from the &s;everity, or the long and con&s;tant application of their labour, would exceed the bounds we have propo&s;ed to the pre|&s;ent work. We &s;hall confine our&s;elves to their <HI>per&s;onal treatment,</HI> as depending on the power of their ma&s;ters, and the protection of the law. Their treatment, if con|fidered in this light, will equally excite our pity and ab|horrence. They were beaten, &s;tarved, tortured, mur|dered at di&s;cretion: they were dead in a civil &s;en&s;e; they had neither name nor tribe; were incapable of a judicial proce&s;s; were in &s;hort without appeal. Poor unfortunate men! to be deprived of all po&s;&s;ible protec|tion! to &s;uffer the bittere&s;t of injuries without the po&s;|&s;ibility of redre&s;s! to be condemned unheard! to be
<PB N="30" REF="019561_0027_0FABFBA3F3B45018">murdered with impunity! to be con&s;idered as dead in that &s;tate, the very members of which they were &s;up|porting by their labours!</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch was their general &s;ituation: there were two places however, where their condition, if con&s;idered in this point of view, was more tolerable. The Aegyptian &s;lave, though perhaps of all others the greate&s;t drudge, yet if he had time to reach the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herodotus. L. 2.113.</NOTE> temple of Hercules, found a certain retreat from the per&s;ecution of his ma&s;ter; and he received additional comfort from the reflection, that his life, whether he could reach it or not, could not be taken with impunity. Wi&s;e and &s;alutary law! how of|ten mu&s;t it have curbed the in&s;olence of power, and &s;topped tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions in their progre&s;s, which had other|wi&s;e been de&s;tructive to the &s;lave!</P>
<P>But though the per&s;ons of &s;laves were thus greatly &s;ecured in Aegypt, yet there was no place &s;o favourable to them as Athens. They were allowed a greater liber|ty of &s;peech;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><L>"Atq id ne vos miremini, Homines &s;ervulos.</L>

Horae. Eupolis.</NOTE> they had then their temple, like the Aegyptian, for refuge; where the legi&s;lature was &s;o at|tentive, as to examine their complaints, and to order them, if they were founded in ju&s;tice, to be &s;old to another ma&s;ter. Nor was this all: they had a privilege
<PB N="31" REF="019561_0028_0FABFBA4DCDA2390">infinitely greater than the whole of the&s;e.

<P>Thus then, to the eternal honour of Aegypt and Athens, they were the only places that we can find, where &s;laves were con&s;idered with any humanity at all. The re&s;t of the world &s;eemed to vie with each other, in the deba&s;ement and oppre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e unfortunate peo|ple. They u&s;ed them with as much &s;everity as they cho&s;e; they mea&s;ured their treatment only by their own pa&s;&s;ion and caprice; and, by leaving them on every oc|ca&s;ion, without the po&s;&s;ibility of an appeal, they render|ed their &s;ituation the mo&s;t melancholy and intolerable, that can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>As we have mentioned the barbarous and inhuman treatment that generally fell to the lot of &s;laves, it may not be ami&s;s to inquire into the various circum&s;tances by which it was produced.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t circum&s;tance, from whence it originated, was the <HI>commerce:</HI> for if men could be con&s;idered as <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions;</HI> if, like <HI>cattle,</HI> they could be <HI>bought</HI> and <HI>&s;old,</HI> it will not be difficult to &s;uppo&s;e, that they could be
<PB N="32" REF="019561_0029_0FABFBA8E9655210">held in the &s;ame con&s;ideration, or treated in the &s;ame manner. The commerce therefore, which was begun in the primitive ages of the world, by cla&s;&s;ing them with the brutal &s;pecies, and by habituating the mind to con|&s;ider the terms of <HI>brute</HI> and <HI>&s;lave</HI> as <HI>&s;ynonimous,</HI> &s;oon cau&s;ed them to be viewed in a low and de&s;picable light, and as greatly inferiour to the human &s;pecies. Hence proceeded that treatment, which might not unrea&s;ona|bly be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from &s;o low an e&s;timation. They were tamed, like bea&s;ts, by the &s;tings of hunger and the la&s;h, and their education was directed to the &s;ame end, to make them commodious in&s;truments of labour for their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>This <HI>treatment,</HI> which thus proceeded in the ages of barbari&s;m, from the low e&s;timation, in which &s;laves were unfortunately held from the circum&s;tances of the com|merce, did not fail of producing, in the &s;ame in&s;tant, its <HI>own</HI> effect. It depre&s;&s;ed their minds; it numbed their faculties; and, by preventing tho&s;e &s;parks of genius from blazing forth, which had otherwi&s;e been con&s;pi|cuous; it gave them the appearance of being endued with inferior capacities than the re&s;t of mankind. This effect of the <HI>treatment</HI> had made &s;o con&s;iderable a pro|gre&s;s, as to have been a matter of ob&s;ervation in the days of Homer.</P>

<L><HI>Whom</HI> once he dooms to &s;ee the <HI>&s;ervile</HI> day.</L></Q>
<P>Thus then did the <HI>commerce,</HI> by cla&s;&s;ing them originally with <HI>brutes,</HI> and the con&s;equent <HI>treatment,</HI> by cramping their <HI>abilities</HI> and hindering them from becoming <HI>con&s;picu|ous,</HI> give to the&s;e unfortunate people, at a very early pe|riod, the mo&s;t unfavourable <HI>appearance.</HI> The ri&s;ing ge|nerations, who received both the commerce and treat|ment from their ance&s;tors, and who had always been ac|cu&s;tomed to behold their <HI>effects,</HI> did not con&s;ider the&s;e <HI>effects</HI> as <HI>incidental:</HI> they judged only from what they &s;aw; they believed the <HI>appearances</HI> to be <HI>real;</HI> and hence aro&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="019561_0030_0FABFBA94DF75528">the combined principle, that &s;laves were an <HI>inferiour</HI> or|der of men, and perfectly void of <HI>under&s;tanding.</HI> Upon this <HI>principle</HI> it was, that the former treatment began to be fully confirmed and e&s;tabli&s;hed; and as this <HI>principle</HI> was handed down and di&s;&s;eminated, &s;o it became, in &s;uc|ceeding ages, an <HI>excu&s;e</HI> for any &s;everity, that de&s;poti&s;m might &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve here, that as all nations had this ex|cu&s;e in common, as ari&s;ing from the <HI>circum&s;tances</HI> above|mentioned, &s;o the Greeks fir&s;t, and the Romans after|wards, had an <HI>additional excu&s;e,</HI> as ari&s;ing from their own <HI>vanity.</HI></P>
<P>The former having conquered Troy, and having united them&s;elves under one common name and intere&s;t, began, from that period, to di&s;tingui&s;h the re&s;t of the world by the title of <HI>barbarians;</HI> inferring by &s;uch an appellation,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle. Polit. Ch. 2. et in&s;eq.</NOTE> <Q>that they were men who were only noble in their own country; that they had no right, from their <HI>na|ture,</HI> to authority or command; that, on the contrary, &s;o low were their capacities, they were <HI>de&s;tined</HI> by na|ture <HI>to obey,</HI> and live in a &s;tate of perpetual drudgery and &s;ubjugation.</Q> Conformable with this opinion was the treatment, which was accordingly pre&s;cribed to a <HI>bar|barian.</HI> The philo&s;opher Ari&s;totle him&s;elf, in the advice which he gave to his pupil Alexander, before he went upon his A&s;iatick expedition,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plutarch de Fortun.

<P>Now, if we con&s;ider that this was the treatment, which they judged to be ab&s;olutely proper for people of this de&s;cription, and that their &s;laves were uniformly tho&s;e,
<PB N="34" REF="019561_0031_0FABFBAA2AF24EF8">whom they termed <HI>barbarians;</HI> being generally &s;uch, as were either kidnapped from <HI>Barbary,</HI> or purcha&s;ed from the <HI>barbarian</HI> conquerors in their wars with one another; we &s;hall immediately &s;ee, with what an additional excu&s;e their own vanity had furni&s;hed them for the &s;allies of ca|price and pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To refute the&s;e cruel &s;entiments of the ancients, and to &s;hew that their &s;laves were by no means an inferiour order of beings than them&s;elves, may perhaps be con|&s;idered as an unnece&s;&s;ary ta&s;k; particularly, as having &s;hewn, that the cau&s;es of this inferiour appearance were <HI>incidental,</HI> ari&s;ing, on the one hand, from the combined effects of the <HI>treatment</HI> and <HI>commerce,</HI> and, on the other, from <HI>vanity</HI> and <HI>pride,</HI> we &s;eem to have refuted them al|ready. But we tru&s;t that &s;ome few ob&s;ervations, in vin|dication of the&s;e unfortunate people, will neither be un|acceptable nor improper.</P>
<P>How then &s;hall we begin the refutation? Shall we &s;ay with Seneca, who &s;aw many of the &s;laves in que&s;tion, <Q>What is a <HI>knight,</HI> or a <HI>libertine,</HI> or a <HI>&s;lave?</HI> Are they not names, a&s;&s;umed either from <HI>injury</HI> or <HI>ambition?</HI></Q> Or, &s;hall we &s;ay with him on another occa&s;ion, <Q>Let us con&s;ider that he, whom we call our &s;lave, is born in the &s;ame manner as our&s;elves; that he enjoys the &s;ame &s;ky, with all its heavenly luminaries; that he breathes, that he lives, in the &s;ame manner as our&s;elves, and, in the &s;ame manner, that he expires.</Q> The&s;e con|&s;iderations, we confe&s;s, would furni&s;h us with a plentiful &s;ource of arguments in the ca&s;e before us; but we de|cline their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. How then &s;hall we begin? Shall we enumerate the many in&s;tances of &s;idelity, patience, or valour, that are recorded of the <HI>&s;ervile</HI> race? Shall we enumerate the many important &s;ervices, that they rendered both to the individuals and the community, un|der whom they lived? Here would be a &s;econd &s;ource, from whence we could collect &s;ufficient materials to thew, that there was no inferiority in their nature. But we de|cline to u&s;e them. We &s;hall content cur&s;elves with &s;ome few in&s;tances, that relate to the <HI>genius</HI> only: we &s;hall mention the names of tho&s;e of a <HI>&s;ervile</HI> condition, who&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="019561_0032_0FABFBAABAD376A8">writings, have e&s;caped the wreck of time, and having been handed down even to the pre&s;ent age, are now to be &s;een, as &s;o many living monuments, that neither the Grecian, nor Roman genius, was &s;uperiour to their own.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, whom we &s;hall mention here, is the famous Ae&s;op. He was a Phrygian by birth, and lived in the time of Croe&s;us, king of Lydia, to whom he dedicated his fables. The writings of this great man, in what|ever light we con&s;ider them, will be equally entitled to our admiration. But we are well aware, that the very mention of him as a writer of fables, may depreciate him in the eyes of &s;ome. To &s;uch we &s;hall propo&s;e a que&s;tion, <Q>Whether this &s;pecies of writing has not been more beneficial to mankind; or whether it has not produced more important events, than any other?</Q></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t con&s;ideration, it is evident that the&s;e fables, as con&s;i&s;ting of plain and &s;imple tran&s;|actions, are particularly ea&s;y to be under&s;tood; as con|veyed in images, they plea&s;e and &s;educe the mind; and, as containing a <HI>moral,</HI> ea&s;ily deducible on the &s;ide of virtue; that they afford, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t weighty precepts of philo&s;ophy. Here then are the two grand points of compo&s;ition, <Q>a manner of expre&s;&s;ion to be apprehended by the lowe&s;t capacities, and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Omne tulit punctum, qui mi&s;cuit utile dulci. Horace.</NOTE> (what is con&s;idered as a victory in the art) an happy conjunction of utility and plea&s;ure.</Q> Hence Quintili|an recommends them, as &s;ingularly u&s;eful, and as ad|mirably adapted, to the puerile age; as a ju&s;t gradation between the language of the nur&s;e and the preceptor, and as furni&s;hing maxims of prudence and virtue, at a time when the &s;peculative principles of philo&s;ophy are too difficult to be under&s;tood. Hence al&s;o having been introduced by mo&s;t civilized nations into their &s;y&s;tem of education, they have produced that general benefit, to which we at fir&s;t alluded. Nor have they been of le&s;s con&s;equence in maturity; but particularly to tho&s;e of infe|riour capacities, or little erudition, whom they have fre|quently
<PB N="36" REF="019561_0033_0FABFBAB8DF165A0">&s;erved as a guide to conduct them in life, and as a medium, through which an explanation might be made, on many and important occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the latter con&s;ideration, which is ea&s;i|ly deducible from hence, we &s;hall only appeal to the wonderful effect, which the fable, pronounced by De|mo&s;thenes again&s;t Philip of Macedon, produced among his hearers; or to the fable, which was &s;poken by Mene|nius Agrippa to the Roman populace; by which an illite|rate multitude were brought back to their duty as citi|zens, when no other &s;pecies of oratory could prevail.</P>
<P>To the&s;e truly <HI>ingenious,</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI> works of Ae&s;op, we &s;hall add tho&s;e of his imitator Phaedrus, which in purity and elegance of &s;tyle, are inferiour to none.

<P>We proceed now to the con&s;ideration of the <HI>commerce:</HI> in con&s;equence of which, people, endued with the &s;ame feelings and faculties as our&s;elves, were made &s;ubject to the laws and limitations of <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="019561_0034_0FABFBAC4747A5C0">
This commerce of the human &s;pecies was of a very early date. It was founded on the idea that men were <HI>property;</HI> and, as this idea was coeval with the fir&s;t or|der of <HI>involuntary</HI> &s;laves, it mu&s;t have ari&s;en, (if the date, which we previou&s;ly affixed to that order, be right) in the fir&s;t practices of barter. The Story of Jo&s;eph, as recorded in the &s;acred writings, whom his brothers &s;old from an envious &s;u&s;picion of his future greatne&s;s, is an ample te&s;timony of the truth of this conjecture. It &s;hews that there were men, even at that early period, who travelled up and down as merchants, collecting not only balm, myrrh, &s;picery, and other wares, but the human &s;pecies al&s;o, for the purpo&s;es of traffick. The in&s;tant determination of the brothers, on the fir&s;t &s;ight of the merchants, <HI>to &s;ell him,</HI> and the immediate acquie&s;cence of the&s;e, who purcha&s;ed him for a foreign market, prove that this commerce had been then e&s;tabli&s;hed, not only in that part of the country, where this tran&s;action hap|pened, but in that al&s;o, whither the merchants were then travelling with their camels, namely, Aegypt: and they &s;hew farther, that, as all cu&s;toms require time for their e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;o it mu&s;t have exi&s;ted in the ages, pre|vious to that of Pharaoh; that is, in tho&s;e ages, in which we fixed the fir&s;t date of <HI>involuntary</HI> &s;ervitude. This commerce then, as appears by the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, exi&s;ted in the earlie&s;t practices of barter, and had de|&s;cended to the Aegyptians, through as long a period of time, as was &s;ufficient to have made it, in the times al|luded to, an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom. Thus was Aegypt, in tho&s;e days, the place of the greate&s;t re&s;ort; the grand emporium of trade, to which people were driving their merchandize, as to a centre; and thus did it afford, among other opportunities of traffick, the <HI>fir&s;t market</HI> that is recorded, for the &s;ale of the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>This market, which was thus &s;upplied by the con&s;tant concour&s;e of merchants, who re&s;orted to it from various parts, could not fail, by the&s;e means, to have been con|&s;iderable. It received, afterwards, an additional &s;upply from tho&s;e piracies, which we mentioned to have exi&s;ted in the uncivilized ages of the world, and which, in fact,
<PB N="38" REF="019561_0035_0FABFBAD1FF46B80">it greatly promoted and encouraged; and it became, from the&s;e united circum&s;tances, &s;o famous, as to have been known, within a few centuries from the time of Pharaoh, both to the Grecian colonies in A&s;ia, and the Grecian i&s;lands. Homer mentions Cyprus and Aegypt as the common markets for &s;laves, about the times of the Trojan war. Thus Antinous, offended with Uly&s;&s;es, threatens to &s;end him to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hom. Ody&s;&s;. L. 17.44<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> one of the&s;e places, if he does not in&s;tantly depart from his table. The &s;ame poet al&s;o, in his<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L. 26.</NOTE> hymn to Bacchus, mentions them again, but in a more unequivocal manner, as the common mar|kets for &s;laves. He takes occa&s;ion, in that hymn, to de&s;cribe the pirates method of &s;couring the coa&s;t, from the circum&s;tance of their having kidnapped Bacchus, as a noble youth, for whom they expected an immen&s;e ran&s;om. The captain of the ve&s;&s;el, having dragged him on board, is repre&s;ented as addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf thus, to the &s;teer&s;man:
<Q><L>"Haul in the tackle, hoi&s;t aloft the &s;ail,</L>
<L>"Then take your helm, and watch the doubtful gale!</L>
<L>"To mind the captive prey, be our's the care,</L>
<L>"While you to <HI>Aegypt</HI> or to <HI>Cyprus</HI> &s;teer;</L>
<L>"There &s;hall he go, unle&s;s his friends he'll tell,</L>
<L>"Who&s;e ran&s;om-gifts will pay us full as well."</L></Q></P>
<P>It may not perhaps be con&s;idered as a digre&s;&s;ion, to mention in &s;ew words, by it&s;elf, the wonderful concor|dance of the writings of Mo&s;es and Homer with the ca&s;e before us: not that the farmer, from their divine autho|rity, want additional &s;upport, but becau&s;e it cannot be unplea&s;ant to &s;ee them confirmed by a per&s;on, who, be|ing one of the earlie&s;t writers, and living in a very re|mote age, was the fir&s;t that could afford us any additional proof of the circum&s;tances above-mentioned. Aegypt is repre&s;ented, in the fir&s;t book of the &s;acred writings, as a market for &s;laves, and, in the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exodus. Ch. 1.</NOTE> &s;econd, as famous

It points it out as a market for the human &s;pecies, and by the epithet of "<HI>bitter</HI> Aegypt," (<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This &s;trikes us the more forcibly, as it is &s;tiled, <HI>"beautiful and well watered,"</HI> in all other pa&s;&s;ages where it is mentioned, but this.</NOTE> which epithet is peculiarly annexed to it on this occa&s;ion) al|ludes in the &s;tronge&s;t manner to that &s;everity and rigour, of which the &s;acred hi&s;torian tran&s;mitted us the fir&s;t ac|count.</P>
<P>But, to return. Though Aegypt was the fir&s;t market recorded for this &s;pecies of traffick; and though Aegypt, and Cyprus afterwards, were particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed for it, in the times of the Trojan war; yet they were not the only places, even at that period, where men were bought and &s;old. The Ody&s;&s;ey of Homer &s;hews that it was then practi&s;ed in many of the i&s;lands of the Aegoean &s;ea; and the Iliad, that it had taken place among tho&s;e Grecians on the continent of Europe, who had embark|ed from thence on the Trojan expedition. This appears particularly at the end of the &s;eventh book. A fleet is de&s;cribed there, as having ju&s;t arrived from Lemnos, with a &s;upply of wine for the Grecian camp. The mer|chants are de&s;cribed al&s;o, as immediaetly expo&s;ing it to &s;ale, and as receiving in exchange, among other articles of barter, <HI>"a number of &s;laves."</HI></P>
<P>It will now be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that, as other &s;tates aro&s;e, and as circum&s;tances contributed to make them known, this cu&s;tom is di&s;covered to have exi&s;ted among them; that it travelled over all A&s;ia; that it &s;pread through the Grecian and Roman world; was in u&s;e among the barbarous nations, which overturned the Roman empire; and was practi&s;ed therefore, at the &s;ame period, throughout all Europe.</P>

<P>This <HI>&s;lavery</HI> and <HI>commerce,</HI> which had continued for &s;o long a time, and which was thus practi&s;ed in Europe at &s;o late a period as that, which &s;ucceeded the grand revolutions in the we&s;tern world, began, as the northern nations were &s;ettled in their conque&s;ts, to decline, and, on their full e&s;tabli&s;hment, were aboli&s;hed. A differ|ence of opinion has ari&s;en re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of their abolition; &s;ome having a&s;&s;erted, that they were the ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the <HI>feudal &s;y&s;tem;</HI> while others, &s;uperiour both in number and in argument, have main|tained that they were the natural effects of <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> The mode of argument, which the former adopt on this occa&s;ion, is as follows. <Q>The multitude of little States, which &s;prang up from one great one at this Aera, oc|ca&s;ioned infinite bickerings and matter for contention. There was not a &s;tate or &s;eignory, which did not want all the hands they could mu&s;ter, either to defend their own right, or to di&s;pute that of their neighbours. Thus every man was taken into the &s;ervice: whom they armed they mu&s;t tru&s;t: and there could be no tru&s;t but in free men. Thus the barrier between the two natures was thrown down, and <HI>&s;lavery</HI> was no more heard of in the <HI>we&s;t.</HI></Q></P>
<P>That this was not the <HI>necc&s;&s;ary</HI> con&s;equence of &s;uch a &s;ituation, is apparent. The political &s;tate of Greece, in its early hi&s;tory, was the &s;ame as that of Europe, when divided, by the feudal &s;y&s;tem, into an infinite number of &s;mall and independent kingdoms. There was the &s;ame matter therefore for contention, and the &s;ame call for all the hands that could be mu&s;tered: the Grecians, in &s;hort, in the <HI>heroick,</HI> were in the &s;ame &s;itu|ation in the&s;e re&s;pects as the <HI>feudal barons</HI> in the <HI>Gothick</HI> times. Had this therefore been a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> effect, there had been a ce&s;&s;ation of &s;ervitude in Greece, in tho&s;e ages, in which we have already &s;hewn that it exi&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="019561_0038_0FABFBAF32A66288">
But with re&s;pect to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> many and great are the arguments, that it occa&s;ioned &s;o de&s;irable an event. It taught, <Q>that all men were originally equal; that the Deity was no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, and that, as all men were to give an account of their actions here|after, it was nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be free.</Q> The&s;e doctrines could not fail of having their proper influence on tho&s;e, who fir&s;t embraced <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> from a <HI>con|viction</HI> of its truth; and on tho&s;e of their de&s;cendents afterwards, who, by engaging in the <HI>cru&s;ades,</HI> and ha|zarding their lives and fortunes there, &s;hewed, at lea&s;t, an <HI>attachment</HI> to that religion. We find them accord|ingly actuated by the&s;e principles: we have a po&s;itive proof, that the <HI>feudal &s;y&s;tem</HI> had no &s;hare in the honour of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;lavery, but that <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> was the only cau&s;e; for the greate&s;t part of the <HI>charters</HI> which were granted for the freedom of &s;laves in tho&s;e times (many of which are &s;till extant) were granted, <Q><HI>pro amore Dei, pro mercede animae.</HI></Q> They were founded, in &s;hort, on religious con&s;iderations, <Q>that they might procure the favour of the Deity, which they conceived them|&s;elves to have forfeited, by the &s;ubjugation of tho&s;e, whom they found to be the objects of the divine be|nevolence and attention equally with them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations, which had thus their fir&s;t origin in <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> began to produce their effects, as the different nations were converted; and procured that general liberty at la&s;t, which, at the clo&s;e of the twelfth century, was con&s;picuous in the we&s;t of Europe. What a glorious and important change! Tho&s;e, who would have had otherwi&s;e no hopes, but that their mi&s;eries would be terminated by death, were then freed from their &s;ervile condition; tho&s;e, who, by the laws of war, would have had otherwi&s;e an immediate pro&s;pect of &s;er|vitude from the hands of their imperious conquerors, were then <HI>exchanged;</HI> a cu&s;tom, which has happily de|&s;cended to the pre&s;ent day. Thus, <Q>A numerous cla&s;s of men, who formerly had no political exi&s;tence, and were employed merely as in&s;truments of labour, be|came u&s;eful citizens, and contributed towards, aug|menting
<PB N="42" REF="019561_0039_0FABFBAFF51E5F98">the force or riches of the &s;ociety, which adopted them as members;</Q> and thus did the greater part of the Europeans, by their conduct on this occa|&s;ion, a&s;&s;ert not only liberty for them&s;elves but for their fellow-creatures, al&s;o.</P>

<P>But if men therefore, at a time when under the in|fluence of religion they exerci&s;ed their &s;erious thoughts, aboli&s;hed &s;lavery, how impious mu&s;t they appear, who revived it; and what arguments will not pre&s;ent them|&s;elves again&s;t their conduct!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following &s;hort hi&s;tory of the African &s;ervitude, is taken from A&s;tley's Collection of Voyages, and from the united te&s;timonies of Smyth.

<P>This practice, however trifling and partial it might appear at fir&s;t, &s;oon became &s;erious and general. A melancholy in&s;tance of the depravity of human nature;
<PB N="43" REF="019561_0040_0FABFBB1C5DA17B8">as it &s;hews, that neither the laws nor religion of any country, however excellent the forms of each, are &s;uf|ficient to bind the con&s;ciences of &s;ome; but that there are always men, of every age, country, and per&s;ua&s;ion, who are ready to &s;acrifice their deare&s;t principles at the &s;hrine of gain. Our own ance&s;tors, together with the Spaniards, French, and mo&s;t of the maritime powers of Europe, &s;oon followed the <HI>piratical</HI> example; and thus did the Europeans, to their eternal infamy, renew a cu&s;|tom, which their <HI>own</HI> ance&s;tors had &s;o lately exploded, from a <HI>con&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of its <HI>impiety.</HI></P>
<P>The unfortunate Africans, terrified at the&s;e repeated depredations, fled in confu&s;ion from the coa&s;t, and &s;ought, in the interiour parts of the country, a retreat from the per&s;ecution of their invaders But, alas, they were mi&s;erably di&s;appointed! There are few retreats, that can e&s;cape the penetrating eye of avarice. The Europeans &s;till pur&s;ued them; they entered their rivers; &s;ailed up into the heart of the country; &s;urprized-tho unfortunate Africans again; and carried them into &s;lavery.</P>
<P>But this conduct, though &s;ucce&s;sful at fir&s;t, defeated afterwards its own ends. It created a more general alarm, and pointed out, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, the be&s;t method of &s;ecurity from future depredations. The banks of the rivers were accordingly de&s;erted, as the coa&s;ts had been before; and thus were the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> invaders left with|out a pro&s;pect of their prey.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation however, expedients were not want|ing. They now formed to them&s;elves the re&s;olution of &s;ettling in the country; of &s;ecuring them&s;elves by forti|&s;ied po&s;ts; of changing their &s;y&s;tem of force into that of pretended liberality; and of opening, by every &s;pe|cies of bribery and corruption, a communication with the natives. The&s;e plans were put into immediate exe|cution. The Europeans erected their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> erected their fir&s;t fort at <HI>D'Elmine,</HI> in the year 1481, about forty years after Alonzo Gonzales had pointed the Southern Africans out to his countrymen as articles of commerce.</NOTE> forts; landed
<PB N="44" REF="019561_0041_0FABFBB2467F8F18">their merchandize; and endeavoured, by a peaceable deportment, by pre&s;ents, and by every appearance of munificence, to &s;educe the attachment and confidence of the Africans. The&s;e &s;chemes had the de&s;ired effect. The gaudy trappings of European art, not only caught their attention, but excited their curio&s;ity: they dazzled the eyes and bewitched the &s;en&s;es, not only of tho&s;e, to whom they were given, but of tho&s;e, to whom they were &s;hewn. Thus followed a &s;peedy intercour&s;e with each other, and a confidence, highly favourable to the views of avarice or ambition.</P>
<P>It was now time for the Europeans to embrace the opportunity, which this intercour&s;e had thus afforded them, of carrying their &s;chemes into execution, and of fixing them on &s;uch a permanent foundation, as &s;hould &s;ecure them future &s;ucce&s;s. They had already di&s;cover|ed, in the different interviews obtained, the chiefs of the African tribes. They paid their court therefore to the&s;e, and &s;o compleatly intoxicated their &s;en&s;es with the luxuries, which they brought from home, as to be able to &s;educe them to their de&s;ings. A treaty of peace and commerce was immediately concluded: it was agreed, that the kings, on their part, &s;hould, from this period, &s;entence <HI>pri&s;oners of war</HI> and <HI>convicts</HI> to <HI>European &s;er|vitude;</HI> and that the Europeans &s;hould &s;upply them, in return, with the luxuries of the north. This agreement immediately took place; and thus begun that <HI>commerce,</HI> which makes &s;o con&s;iderable a figure at the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>But happy had the Africans been, if tho&s;e only, who had beer, ju&s;tly convicted of crimes, or taken in a ju&s;t war, had been &s;entenced to the &s;everities of &s;ervitude! How many of tho&s;e mi&s;eries, which afterwards attended them, had been never known; and how would their hi&s;tory have &s;aved tho&s;e &s;ighs and emotions of pity, which mu&s;t now ever accompany its peru&s;al. The Eu|ropeans, on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their we&s;tern colonies, required a greater number of &s;laves than a &s;trict adhe|rence to the treaty could produce. The princes there|fore had only the choice of relinqui&s;hing the commerce,
<PB N="45" REF="019561_0042_0FABFBBAA68432F0">or of con&s;enting to become unju&s;t. They had long ex|perienced the emoluments of the trade; they had ac|quired a ta&s;te for the luxuries it afforded; and they now beheld an opportunity of gratifying it, but in a more exten&s;ive manner. <HI>Avarice</HI> therefore, which was too powerful for <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> on this occa&s;ion, immediately turned the &s;cale: not only tho&s;e, who were fairly convicted of offences, were now &s;entenced to &s;ervitude, but even tho&s;e who were <HI>&s;u&s;pected.</HI> New crimes were invented, that new puni&s;hments might &s;ucceed. Thus was every appearance &s;oon con&s;trued into reality; every &s;hadow into a &s;ub&s;tance; and often virtue into a crime.</P>
<P>Such al&s;o was the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to pri&s;oners of war. Not only tho&s;e were now delivered into &s;lavery, who were taken in a &s;tate of publick enmity and inju&s;|tice, but tho&s;e al&s;o, who, con&s;cious of no injury what|ever; were taken in the <HI>arbitrary</HI> &s;kirmi&s;hes of the&s;e <HI>venal</HI> &s;overeigns. War was now made, not as former|ly, from the motives of retaliation and defence, but for the &s;ake of obtaining pri&s;oners alone, and the advan|tages re&s;ulting from their &s;ale. If a &s;hip from Europe came but into &s;ight, it was now con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient motive for a war, and as a &s;ignal only for an in&s;tantane|ous commencement of ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>But if the African kings could be capable of &s;uch inju&s;tice, what vices are there, that their con&s;ciences would re&s;train, or what enormities, that we might not expect to be committed? When men once con&s;ent to be unju&s;t, they lo&s;e, at the &s;ame in&s;tant with their virtue, a con&s;iderable portion of that &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, which, till then, had been found a &s;ucce&s;sful protector again&s;t the &s;allies of vice. From that awful period, almo&s;t eve|ry expectation is forlorn: the heart is left unguarded: its great protector is no more: the <HI>vices</HI> therefore, which &s;o long encompa&s;&s;ed it in vain, obtain an ea&s;y vic|tory: in crouds they pour into the defencele&s;s avenues, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul: there is nothing now too vile for them to meditate, too impious to perform. Such was the &s;ituation of the de&s;potick &s;overeigns of Africa. They had once ventured to pa&s;s the bounds of
<PB N="46" REF="019561_0043_0FABFBBB2DB3F768">virtue, and they &s;oon proceeded to enormity. This was particularly con&s;picuous in that general conduct, which they uniformly ob&s;erved, after any un&s;ucce&s;sful conflict. Influenced only by the venal motives of European traf|fick, they fir&s;t made war upon the neighbouring tribes, contrary to every principle of ju&s;tice; and if, by the flight of the enemy, or by other contingencies, they were di&s;appointed of their prey, they made no he&s;ita|tion of immediately turning their arms again&s;t their own &s;ubjects. The fir&s;t villages they came to, were al|ways marked on this occa&s;ion, as the fir&s;t objects of their avarice. They were immediately &s;urrounded, were afterwards &s;et on &s;ire, and the wretched inhabitants &s;eized, as they were e&s;caping from the flames. The&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of whole families, fathers, brothers, hu&s;bands, wives, and children, were in&s;tantly driven in chains to the merchants, and con&s;igned to &s;lavery.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>AS we explained the Hi&s;tory of Slavery in the fir&s;t part of this E&s;&s;ay, as far as it was nece&s;&s;ary for our purpo&s;e, we &s;hall now take the que&s;tion into con&s;i|deration, which we propo&s;ed at fir&s;t as the &s;ubject of our inquiry, viz. how far the commerce and &s;lavery of the human &s;pecies, as revived by &s;ome of the nations of Eu|rope in the per&s;ons of the unfortunate Africans, and as revived, in a great mea&s;ure, on the principles of anti|quity, are con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of nature, or the common notions of equity, as e&s;tabli&s;hed among men.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion re&s;olves it&s;elf into two &s;eparate parts for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, into <HI>the African commerce (as explained in the hi&s;tory of &s;lavery)</HI> and <HI>the &s;ub&s;equent &s;lavery in the colo|nies, as founded on the equity of the commerce.</HI> The for|mer, of cour&s;e, will be fir&s;t examined. For this pur|po&s;e we &s;hall inquire into the ri&s;e, nature, and de&s;ign of government. Such an inquiry will be particularly u&s;eful in the pre&s;ent place; it will afford us that general know|ledge of &s;ubordination and liberty, which is nece&s;&s;ary in the ca&s;e before us, and will be &s;ound, as it were, a &s;ource, to which we may frequently refer for many and valuable arguments.</P>

It appears that mankind were originally free, and that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an equal right to the &s;oil and produce of the earth. For proof of this, we need only appeal to the <HI>divine</HI> writings; to the <HI>golden age</HI> of the poets, which, like other fables of the times, had its origin in truth; and to the in&s;titution of the <HI>Saturnalia,</HI> and of other &s;imilar fe&s;tivals; all of which are &s;o many monuments of this original equality of men. Hence then there was no rank, no di&s;tinction, no &s;uperiour. Every man wan|dered where he cho&s;e, changing his re&s;idence, as a &s;pot attracted his fancy, or &s;uited his convenience, uncon|trouled by his neighbour, unconnected with any but his family. Hence al&s;o (as every thing was common) he collected what he cho&s;e without injury, and enjoyed without injury what he had collected. Such was the fir&s;t &s;ituation of mankind;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This conclu&s;ion concerning the di&s;&s;ociated &s;tate of mankind, is confirmed by all the carly writers, with who&s;e de&s;criptions of primi|tive times no other conclu&s;ion is reconcileable.</NOTE> a &s;tate of <HI>di&s;&s;ociation</HI> and <HI>independence.</HI></P>
<P>In this di&s;&s;ociated &s;tate it is impo&s;&s;ible that men could have long continued. The dangers to which they mu&s;t have frequently been expo&s;ed, by the attacks of fierce and rapacious bea&s;ts, by the procdatory attempts of their own &s;pecies, and by the di&s;putes of contiguous and independent families; the&s;e, together with their in|ability to defend them&s;elves, on many &s;uch occa&s;ions, mu&s;t have incited them to unite. Hence then was <HI>&s;ocie|ty</HI> formed on the grand principles of pre&s;ervation and de|fence: and as the&s;e principles began to operate, in the different parts of the earth, where the different families had roamed, a great number of the&s;e <HI>&s;ocieties</HI> began to be formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed; which, taking to them&s;elves particular names from particular occurrences, began to be perfectly di&s;tinct from one another.</P>
<P>As the individuals, of whom the&s;e &s;ocieties were com|po&s;ed, had a&s;&s;ociated only for their defence, &s;o they ex|perienced, at fir&s;t, no change in their condition. They
<PB N="51" REF="019561_0048_0FABFBC1504B2C50">were &s;till independent and free; they were &s;till without di&s;cipline or laws; the had every thing &s;till in common; they pur&s;ued the &s;ame manner of life; wandering only, in <HI>herds,</HI> as the earth gave them or refu&s;ed them &s;u&s;tenance, and doing, as a <HI>publick body,</HI> what they had been accu&s;|tomed to do as <HI>individuals</HI> before. This was the exact &s;ituation of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ju&s;tin. L. 2.

Thus was the &s;econd &s;ituation of men a &s;tate of <HI>independent &s;ocicty.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus joined them&s;elves together, and having formed them&s;elves into &s;everal large and di&s;tinct bodies, they could not &s;ail of &s;ubmitting &s;oon to a more con&s;ide|rable change. Their numbers mu&s;t have rapidly increa&s;|ed, and their &s;ocieties, in proce&s;s of time, have become &s;o populous, as frequently to have experienced the want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and many of the commotions and tumults of inte&s;tine &s;trife. For the&s;e inconveniences however there were remedies to be found. <HI>Agriculture</HI> would fur|ni&s;h them with that &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;upport, which the earth, from the rapid increa&s;e of its inhabitants, had be|come unable &s;pontaneou&s;ly to produce. An <HI>A&s;&s;ignation</HI> of <HI>property</HI> would not only enforce an application, but ex|cite an emulation, to labour; and <HI>government</HI> would at once afford a &s;ecurity to the acqui&s;itions of the indu&s;tri|ous, and heal the inte&s;tine di&s;orders of the community, by the introduction of Laws.</P>
<P>Such then were the remedies, that were gradually ap|plied. The <HI>&s;ocieties,</HI> which had hitherto &s;een their mem|bers, undi&s;tingui&s;hed either by authority or rank, ad|mitted now of magi&s;tratical pre-eminence. They were divided into tribes; to every tribe was allotted a particu|lar di&s;trict for its &s;upport, and to every individual his

<HEAD>CHAP II.</HEAD>
<P>As we have thus traced the &s;ituation of man from un|bounded liberty to &s;ubordination, it will be proper to carry our inquiries farther, and to con&s;ider, who fir&s;t obtained the pre-eminence in the&s;e <HI>primoeval &s;ocieties,</HI> and by what particular methods it was obtained,</P>
<P>There where only two ways, by which &s;uch an event could have been produced, by <HI>compul&s;ion</HI> or <HI>con&s;ent.</HI>&mdash; When mankind fir&s;t &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of government, it is probable that many had conceived the de&s;ire of rul|ing. To be placed in a new &s;ituation, to be taken from the common herd, to be the fir&s;t, di&s;tingui&s;hed among men, were thoughts, that mu&s;t have had their charms. Let us &s;uppo&s;e then, that the&s;e thoughts had worked &s;o unu&s;ually on the pa&s;&s;ions of any particular individual, as to have driven him to the extravagant de&s;ign of ob|taining the pre-eminence by force. How could his de|&s;ign have been accompli&s;hed? How could he forcibly have u&s;urped the juri&s;diction at a time, when, all being equally free, there was not a &s;ingle per&s;on, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance he could command? Add to this, that, in a &s;tate of univer&s;al liberty, force had been repaid by force, and the attempt had been fatal to the u&s;urper.</P>
<P>As <HI>empire</HI> then could never have been gained at fir&s;t by <HI>compul&s;ion,</HI> &s;o it could only have been obtained by <HI>con&s;ent;</HI> and as men were then going to make an import|ant &s;acrifice, for the &s;ake of their <HI>mutual</HI> happine&s;s, &s;o he alone could have obtained it, (not who&s;e <HI>ambition</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="019561_0050_0FABFBC2DFC41480">had greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed him from the re&s;t) but in who&s;e <HI>wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, prudence,</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> the whole community could confide.</P>
<P>To confirm this rea&s;oning, we &s;hall appeal, as before, to facts; and &s;hall con&s;ult therefore the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e nations, which having ju&s;t left their former &s;tate of <HI>in|dependent &s;ociety,</HI> were the very people that e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>&s;ubordination</HI> and <HI>government.</HI></P>
<P>The commentaries of Cae&s;ar afforded us the following accounts of the ancient Gauls. When any of their kings, either by death, or depo&s;ition, made a vacancy in the regal office, the whole nation was immediately convened for the appointment of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. In the&s;e national conventions were the regal offices conferred. Every individual had a voice on the occa&s;ion, and eve|ry individual was free. The per&s;on upon whom the general approbation appeared to fall, was immediately advanced to pre-eminence in the &s;tate. He was uni|formly one, who&s;e actions had made him eminent; who&s;e conduct had gained him previous applau&s;e; who&s;e valour the very a&s;&s;embly, that elected him, had them&s;elves wit|ne&s;&s;ed in the field; who&s;e prudence, wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, having rendered him &s;ignally &s;erviceable, had endeared him to his tribe. For this rea&s;on, their kingdoms were not hereditary; the &s;on did not always inherit the virtues of the &s;ire; and they were determined that he alone &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s authority, in who&s;e virtues they could con|&s;ide. Nor was this all. So &s;en&s;ible were they of the im|portant &s;acrifice they had made; &s;o extemely jealous even of the name of &s;uperiority and power, that they limited, by a variety of laws, the authority of the very per&s;on, whom they had ju&s;t elected, from a confidence of his integrity; Ambiorix him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ing, <Q>that his people had as much power over him, as he could po&s;&s;ibly have over his people.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame cu&s;tom, as appears from Tacitus, prevailed al&s;o among the Germans. They had their national, councils, like the Gauls; in which the regal and ducal offices were confirmed according to the majority of voices. They elected al&s;o, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, tho&s;e only,
<PB N="54" REF="019561_0051_0FABFBC3726DA718">whom their virtue, by repeated trial, had unequivocally di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t; and they limited their au|thority &s;o far, as neither to leave them the power of in|flicting impri&s;onment or &s;tripes, nor of exerci&s;ing any penal juri&s;diction. But as puni&s;hment was nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;tate of civil &s;ociety, <Q>it was permitted to the prie&s;ts alone, that it might appear to have been inflicted, by the order of the gods, and not by any &s;uperiour au|thority in man.</Q></P>
<P>The accounts which we have thus given of the anci|ent Germans and Gauls, will be found al&s;o to be equally true of tho&s;e people, which had arrived at the &s;ame &s;tate of &s;ubordinate &s;ociety. We might appeal, for a te&s;timony of this, to the hi&s;tory of the Goths; to the hi&s;tory of the Franks and Saxons; to the hi&s;tory in &s;hort, of all tho&s;e nations, from which the different governments, now con&s;picuous in Europe, have undeniably &s;prung. And we might appeal, as a farther proof, to the Americans, who are repre&s;ented by many of the moderns, from their own ocular te&s;timony, as ob&s;erving the &s;ame cu&s;|toms at the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>It remains only to ob&s;erve, that as the&s;e cu&s;toms pre|vailed among the different nations de&s;cibed, in their early &s;tate of &s;ubordinate &s;ociety, and as they were more|over the cu&s;toms of their re&s;pective ance&s;tors, it appears that they mu&s;t have been handed down, both by tradi|tion and u&s;e, from the fir&s;t introduction of <HI>govern|ment.</HI></P>

<P>We may now deduce tho&s;e general maxims concern|ing <HI>&s;ubordination,</HI> and <HI>liberty,</HI> which we mentioned to have been e&s;&s;entially connected with the &s;ubject, and which &s;ome, from &s;peculation only, and without any al|lu&s;ion to facts, have been bold enough to deny.</P>
<P>It appears fir&s;t, that <HI>liberty</HI> is a <HI>natural,</HI> and <HI>govern|ment</HI> an <HI>adventitious</HI> right, becau&s;e all men were origi|nally free.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="019561_0052_0FABFBC436010320">
It appears &s;econdly, that government is a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author has lately read a work, intitled Paley's Moral and Political Philo&s;ophy, which, in this one re&s;pect, favours tho&s;e which have been hinted at, as it denies that government was a contract. <Q>No &s;ocial compact was ever made in fact,"&mdash;"it is to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible to call &s;avages out of caves and de&s;erts, to deliberate upon topicks, which the experience and &s;tudies, and the refine|ments of civil life alone &s;ugge&s;t. Therefore no government in the univer&s;e begun from this original.</Q> But there are no grounds for &s;o ab&s;urd a &s;uppo&s;ition; for government, and of cour&s;e the &s;o|cial compact, does not appear to have been introduced at the time, when families coming out of their caves and de&s;erts, or, in other words, quitting their former <HI>di&s;&s;ociated</HI> &s;tate, joined them&s;elves to|gether. They had lived a con&s;iderable time in <HI>&s;ociety,</HI> like the Ly|bians and Goetulians before-mentioned, and had felt many of the di&s;advantages of a want of di&s;cipline and laws, before government was introduced at all. The author of this E&s;&s;ay, before he took into con&s;ideration the origin of government, was determined, in a matter of &s;uch importance, to be bia&s;&s;ed by no opinion whatever, and much le&s;s to indulge him&s;elf in &s;peculation. He was determined &s;olely to adhere to fact, and, by looking into the accounts left us of tho&s;e governments which were in their infancy, and, of cour&s;e in the lea&s;t complicated &s;tate, to attempt to di&s;cover their foundation: he cannot &s;ay therefore, that upon a very minute peru&s;al of the ex|cellent work before quoted, he has been &s;o far convinced, as to re|tract in the lea&s;t from his &s;entiments on this head, and to give up maxims, which are drawn from hi&s;torical facts, for tho&s;e, which are the re&s;ult of &s;peculation. He may ob&s;erve here, that whether go|vernment was a <HI>contract</HI> or not, it will not affect the rea&s;oning of the pre&s;ent E&s;&s;ay; &s;ince where ever the contract is afterwards mention|ed, it is inferred only that its object was "the <HI>happine&s;s of the peo|ple,</HI>" which is confe&s;&s;edly the end of government. Notwith&s;tand|ing this, he is under the nece&s;&s;ity of in&s;erting this little note, though he almo&s;t feels him&s;elf ungrateful in contradicting a work, which has afforded him &s;o much entertainment.</NOTE><HI>contract;</HI> becau&s;e, in the&s;e primoeval &s;ubordinate &s;ocieties, we have &s;een it voluntarily conferred on the one hand, and ac|cepted on the other.

<P>Having now collected the materials that are nece&s;&s;ary for the pro&s;ecution of our de&s;ign, we &s;hall immediately enter upon the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If any man had originally been endued with power, as with other faculties, &s;o that the re&s;t of mankind had di&s;covered in them&s;elves an <HI>innate nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of obeying this particular per&s;on; it is evident that he and his de|&s;cendants, from the &s;uperiority of their nature, would have had a claim upon men for obedience, and a natural right to command: but as the right to empire is <HI>adven|titious;</HI> as all were originally free; as nature made every man's body and mind <HI>his own;</HI> it is evident that no ju&s;t man can be con&s;igned to <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> without his own <HI>con|&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>Neither can men, by the &s;ame principles, be con&s;i|dered as lands, goods, or hou&s;es, among <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary that all <HI>property</HI> &s;hould be inferiour to its <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</HI> But how does the <HI>&s;lave</HI> differ from his <HI>ma&s;ter,</HI> but by <HI>chance?</HI> For though the mark, with which the latter is plea&s;ed to brand him, &s;hews, at the fir&s;t &s;ight, the difference of their <HI>fortune;</HI> what mark can be found in his <HI>nature,</HI> that can warrant a di&s;tinction?</P>
<P>To this con&s;ideration we &s;hall add the following, that if men can ju&s;tly become the property of each other, their children, like the offspring of cattle, mu&s;t inherit their <HI>paternal</HI> lot. Now, as the actions of the father and the child mu&s;t be thus at the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of their common ma&s;ter, it is evident, that the <HI>authority</HI> of the
<PB N="57" REF="019561_0054_0FABFBD701054E88">one, as a <HI>parent,</HI> and the <HI>duty</HI> of the other, as a <HI>child,</HI> mu&s;t be in&s;tantly annihilated; rights and obligations, which, as they are founded in nature, are implanted in our feelings, and are e&s;tabli&s;hed by the voice of God, mu&s;t contain in their annihilation a &s;olid argument to prove, that there cannot be any <HI>property</HI> whatever in the <HI>human &s;pecies.</HI></P>
<P>We may con&s;ider al&s;o, as a farther confirmation, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, that <HI>liberty</HI> can be <HI>bought</HI> or <HI>&s;old!</HI> It is neither <HI>&s;aleable,</HI> nor <HI>purcha&s;able.</HI> For if any one man can have an ab&s;olute property in the liberty of another, or, in other words, if he, who is called a <HI>ma&s;ter,</HI> can have a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> right to command the actions of him, who is called a <HI>&s;lave,</HI> it is evident that the latter cannot be accountable for tho&s;e crimes, which the former may order him to commit. Now as every rea&s;onable being is accountable for his actions, it is evident, that &s;uch a right cannot <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> exi&s;t, and that human liberty, of cour&s;e, is beyond the po&s;&s;ibility either of <HI>&s;ale</HI> or <HI>purcha&s;e.</HI> Add to this, that, whenever you &s;ell the liberty of a man, you have the power only of alluding to the <HI>body:</HI> the <HI>mind</HI> cannot be confined or bound: it will be free, though its man&s;ion be be&s;et with chains. But if, in every &s;ale of the <HI>human &s;pecies,</HI> you are under the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;idering your &s;lave in this ab&s;tracted light; of alluding only to the body, and of making no allu&s;ion to the mind; you are under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity al&s;o of treating him, in the &s;ame moment, as a <HI>brute,</HI> and of abu&s;ing therefore that nature, which can|not otherwi&s;e be con&s;idered, than in the double capacity of <HI>&s;oul</HI> and <HI>body.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome per&s;on, perhaps, will make an objection to one of the former arguments. <Q>If men, from the <HI>&s;u|periority</HI> of their nature, cannot be con&s;idered, like lands, goods, or hou&s;es, among po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;o neither can cattle: for being endued with life, motion, and &s;en&s;ibility, they are evidently <HI>&s;uperiour</HI> to the&s;e.</Q>&mdash; But this objection will receive its an&s;wer from tho&s;e ob|&s;ervations which have been already made; and will di&s;|cover the true rea&s;on, why cattle are ju&s;tly to be e&s;ti|mated
<PB N="58" REF="019561_0055_0FAFFBD7C0C05648">as property. For fir&s;t, the right to empire over brutes, is <HI>natural,</HI> and not <HI>adventitious,</HI> like the right to empire over men. There are, &s;econdly, many and evident &s;igns of the <HI>inferiority</HI> of their nature; and thirdly, their liberty can be bought and &s;old, becau&s;e, being void of rea&s;on, they cannot be <HI>accountable</HI> for their actions.</P>
<P>We might &s;top here for a con&s;iderable time, and de|duce many valuable le&s;&s;ons from the remarks that have been made, but that &s;uch a circum&s;tance might be con|&s;idered as a digre&s;&s;ion. There is one, however, which, as it is &s;o intimately connected with the &s;ubject, we can|not but deduce. We are taught to treat men in a dif|ferent manner from brutes, becau&s;e they are &s;o manife&s;t|ly &s;uperiour in their nature; we are taught to treat brutes in a different manner from &s;tones, for the &s;ame rea&s;on; and thus, by giving to every created thing its due re|&s;pect, to an&s;wer the views of Providence, which did not create a variety of natures without a purpo&s;e or de|&s;ign.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e things are &s;o, how evidently again&s;t rea|&s;on, nature, and every thing human and divine, mu&s;t they act, who not only force men into <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> again&s;t their own <HI>con&s;ent,</HI> but treat them altogether as <HI>brutes,</HI> and make the <HI>natural liberty</HI> of man an article of pub|lick commerce! and by what arguments can they po&s;&s;i|bly defend that commerce, which cannot be carried on, in any &s;ingle in&s;tance, without a flagrant violation of the laws of nature and of God?</P>

<P>That we may the more accurately examine the argu|ments that are advanced on this occa&s;ion, it will be pro|per to divide the <HI>commerce</HI> into two parts; fir&s;t, as it relates to tho&s;e who <HI>&s;ell,</HI> and &s;econdly, as it relates to tho&s;e who <HI>purcha&s;e,</HI> the <HI>human &s;pecies</HI> into &s;lavery.

<P><PB N="59" REF="019561_0056_0FABFBD874AF2AD8">
Let us inquire fir&s;t, by what particular right the <HI>liber|ties</HI> of the harmle&s;s people are invaded by the <HI>prince.</HI> "By the <HI>right of empire,</HI>" it will be an&s;wered; <Q>be|cau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es dominion and power by their own approbation and con&s;ent.</Q> But &s;ubjects, though un|der the dominion, are not the <HI>property,</HI> of the prince. They cannot be con&s;idered as his <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</HI> Their <HI>na|tures</HI> are both the &s;ame; they are both born in the &s;ame manner; are &s;ubject to the &s;ame di&s;orders; mu&s;t apply to the &s;ame remedies for a cure; are equally partakers of the grave: an <HI>incidental</HI> di&s;tinction accompanies them through life, and this&mdash;is all.</P>
<P>We may add to this, that though the prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es dominion and power, by the con&s;ent and approbation of his &s;ubjects, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it only for the mo&s;t <HI>&s;alutary</HI> ends. He may tyrannize, if he can: he may alter the <HI>form</HI> of his government: he cannot, however, alter its <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>end.</HI> The&s;e will be immutably the &s;ame, though the whole &s;y&s;tem of its admini&s;tration &s;hould be changed; and he will be &s;till bound to <HI>defend</HI> the lives and properties of his &s;ubjects, and to make them <HI>happy.</HI></P>
<P>Does he defend tho&s;e therefore, whom he invades at di&s;cretion with the &s;word? Does he protect the property of tho&s;e, who&s;e hou&s;es and effects he con&s;igns at di&s;cre|tion to the flames? Does he make tho&s;e happy, whom he &s;eizes, as they are trying to e&s;cape the general deva&s;t|ation, and compels with their wives and families to a wretched <HI>&s;ervitude?</HI> He acts &s;urely, as if the u&s;e of em|pire con&s;i&s;ted in violence and oppre&s;&s;ion; as if he, that was mo&s;t exalted, ought, of neceffity, to be mo&s;t un|ju&s;t. Here then the voice of <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> is again&s;t him. He breaks that law of <HI>nature,</HI> which ordains, <Q>that no ju&s;t man &s;hall be given into &s;lavery, again&s;t his own <HI>con&s;ent:</HI></Q> he violates the fir&s;t law of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> as e&s;tabli&s;hed among men, <Q>that no per&s;on &s;hall do harm to another without a previous and &s;ufficient <HI>pro|vocation;</HI></Q> and he violates al&s;o the &s;acred condition of <HI>empire,</HI> made with his ance&s;tors, and nece&s;&s;arily under|&s;tood in every &s;pecies of government, <Q>that, the power

<P>But if kings then, to whom their own people have granted dominion and power, are unable to invade the liberties of their harmle&s;s &s;ubjects, without the highe&s;t <HI>inju&s;tice;</HI> how can tho&s;e private per&s;ons be ju&s;tified, who treacherou&s;ly lie in wait for their fellow-creatures, and &s;ell them into &s;lavery? What arguments can they po&s;&s;i|bly bring in their defence? What treaty of empire can they produce, by which their innocent victims ever re|&s;igned to them the lea&s;t portion of their <HI>liberty?</HI> In vain will they plead the <HI>antiquity</HI> of the cu&s;tom: in vain will the <HI>honourable</HI> light, in which <HI>piracy</HI> was con&s;idered in the ages of barbari&s;m, afford them an excu&s;e.

<P>It appears then, that the two orders of &s;laves, which have been mentioned in the hi&s;tory of the African &s;er|vitude, <Q>of tho&s;e who are publickly &s;eized by virtue of the authority of their prince; and of tho&s;e, who are privately kidnapped by individuals,</Q> are collected by means of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion; by means, repugnant to <HI>nature,</HI> the principles of <HI>government,</HI> and the common notions of <HI>equity,</HI> as e&s;tabli&s;hed among men.</P>

<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>We come now to the third order of <HI>involuntary</HI> &s;laves, "to convicts." The only argument that the &s;ellers ad|vance here, is this, <Q>that they have been found guilty of offences, and that the puni&s;hment is ju&s;t.</Q> But before the equity of the &s;entence can be allowed, two que&s;tions mu&s;t be decided, whether the puni&s;hment is <HI>proportioned</HI> to the offence, and what is its particular <HI>ob|ject</HI> and <HI>end?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="019561_0058_0FABFBDAD58B0F78">
To decide the fir&s;t, we may previou&s;ly ob&s;erve, that the African &s;ervitude comprehends <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> a <HI>depri|vation</HI> of <HI>liberty,</HI> and many <HI>corporal</HI> &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>On <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> the following ob&s;ervations will &s;uffice. Mankind have their <HI>local</HI> attachments. They have a particular regard for the &s;pot, in which they were born and nurtured. Here it was, that they fir&s;t drew their infant-breath: here, that they were cheri&s;hed and &s;up|ported: here, that they pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e &s;cenes of childhood, which, free from care and anxiety, are the happie&s;t in the life of man; &s;cenes, which accompany them through life; which throw them&s;elves frequently into their thoughts, and produce the mo&s;t agreeable &s;en&s;ations. The&s;e then are weighty con&s;iderations; and how great this regard is, may be evidenced from our own feelings; from the te&s;timony of &s;ome, who when remote from their country, and in the hour of danger and di&s;tre&s;s, have found their thoughts unu&s;ually directed, by &s;ome impul&s;e or other, to their native &s;pot; and from the ex|ample of others, who, having braved the &s;torms and ad|ver&s;ities of life, either repair to it for the remainder of their days, or de&s;ire even to be conveyed to it, when exi&s;tence is no more.</P>
<P>But &s;eparately from the&s;e their <HI>local,</HI> they have al&s;o their <HI>per&s;onal</HI> attachments; their regard for particular men. There are ties of blood; there are ties of friend|&s;hip. In the former ca&s;e, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be at|tached: the con&s;titution of their nature demands it. In the latter, it is impo&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e; &s;ince friend|&s;hip is founded on an harmony of temper, on a concord|ance of &s;entiments and manners, on habits of confi|dence, and a mutual exchange of favours.</P>
<P>We may now mention, as perfectly di&s;tinct both from their <HI>local</HI> and <HI>per&s;onal,</HI> the <HI>national</HI> attachments of man|kind, their regard for the whole body of the people, among whom they were born and educated. This re|gard is particularly con&s;picuous in the conduct of &s;uch, as, being thus <HI>nationally</HI> connected, re&s;ide in foreign parts. How anxiou&s;ly do they meet together! how much do they enjoy the &s;ight of others of their countrymen,
<PB N="62" REF="019561_0059_0FABFBDB6E8A5268">whom fortune places in their way! what an eagerne&s;s do they &s;hew to &s;erve them, though not born on the &s;ame particular &s;pot, though not connected by con&s;anguinity or friend&s;hip, though unknown to them before! Neither is this affection wonderful, &s;ince they are creatures of the &s;ame education; of the &s;ame principles; of the &s;ame manners and habits; ca&s;t, as it were, in the &s;ame mould; and marked with the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If men therefore are thus &s;eparately attached to the &s;everal objects de&s;cribed, it is evident that a &s;eparate ex|clu&s;ion from either mu&s;t afford them con&s;iderable pain. What then mu&s;t be their &s;ufferings, to be forced for ever from their country, which includes them all? Which contains the <HI>&s;pot,</HI> in which they were born and nur|tured; which contains their <HI>relations</HI> and <HI>friends;</HI> which contains the whole body of the <HI>people,</HI> among whom they were bred and educated. In the&s;e &s;ufferings, which ari&s;e to men, both in bidding, and in having bid, adieu to all that they e&s;teem as dear and valuable, <HI>bani&s;hment</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in part; and we may agree therefore with the ancients, without adding other melancholy circum&s;tances to the account, that it is no incon&s;iderable puni&s;hment of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the <HI>lo&s;s</HI> of <HI>liberty,</HI> which is the &s;econd con&s;ideration in the puni&s;hment, it is evident that men bear nothing wor&s;e; that there is nothing, that they lay more at heart; and that they have &s;hewn, by many and memorable in&s;tances, that even death is to be preferred. How many could be named here, who, having &s;uffered the <HI>lo&s;s</HI> of <HI>liberty,</HI> have put a period to their exi&s;tence! How many, that have willingly undergone the hazard of their lives to de&s;troy a tyrant! How many, that have even gloried to peri&s;h in the attempt! How many bloody and publick wars have been undertaken (not to mention the numerous <HI>&s;ervile</HI> in&s;urrections, with which hi&s;tory is &s;tained) for the cau&s;e of <HI>freedom!</HI></P>
<P>But if nothing is dearer than <HI>liberty</HI> to men, with which, the barren rock is able to afford its joys, and without which, the glorious &s;un &s;hines upon them but in vain, and all the &s;weets and delicacies of life are ta&s;te|le&s;s
<PB N="63" REF="019561_0060_0FABFBE72F3E5C40">and unenjoyed; what puni&s;hment can be more &s;evere than the lo&s;s of &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing? But if to this <HI>depri|vation</HI> of <HI>liberty,</HI> we add the agonizing pangs of <HI>bani&s;h|ment;</HI> and if to the complicated &s;tings of both, we add the ince&s;&s;ant <HI>&s;tripes, wounds,</HI> and <HI>mi&s;eries,</HI> which are un|dergone by tho&s;e, who are &s;old into this horrid <HI>&s;ervitude;</HI> what crime can we po&s;&s;ibly imagine to be &s;o enormous, as to be worthy of &s;o great a puni&s;hment?</P>
<P>How contrary then to rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and nature, mu&s;t tho&s;e act, who apply this, the &s;evere&s;t of human puni&s;hments, to the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant offence! yet &s;uch is the cu&s;tom with the Africans: for, from the time, in which the Europeans fir&s;t intoxicated the African princes with their foreign draughts, no crime has been com|mitted, no &s;hadow of a crime devi&s;ed, that has not im|mediately been puni&s;hed with <HI>&s;ervitude.</HI></P>
<P>But for what purpo&s;e is the puni&s;hment applied? Is it applied to amend the manners of the criminal, and thus render him a better &s;ubject? No, for if you bani&s;h him, he can no longer be a &s;ubject, and you can no longer therefore be &s;olicitous for his morals. Add to this, that if you bani&s;h him to a place, where he is to experience the hard&s;hips of want and hunger (&s;o powerfully does hunger compel men to the perpetration of crimes) you force him rather to corrupt, than amend his manners, and to be wicked, when he might otherwi&s;e be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Is it applied then, that others may be deterred from the &s;ame proceedings, and that crimes may become le&s;s frequent? No, but that <HI>avarice</HI> may be gratified; that the prince may experience the emoluments of the &s;ale: for, horrid and melancholy thought! the more crimes his &s;ubjects commit, the richer is he made; the more <HI>abandoned</HI> the &s;ubject, the <HI>happier</HI> is the prince!</P>
<P>Neither can we allow that the puni&s;hment thus applied, tends in any degree to an&s;wer the <HI>publick happine&s;s;</HI> for if men can be &s;entenced to &s;lavery, right or wrong; if &s;hadows can be turned into &s;ub&s;tances, and virtues into crimes; it is evident that none can be happy, becau&s;e none can be &s;ecure.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="019561_0061_0FABFBE8CD943628">
But if the puni&s;hment is infinitely greater than the of|fence, (which has been &s;hewn before) and if it is in|flicted, neither to amend the criminal, nor to deter others from the &s;ame proceedings, nor to advance, in any degree, the happine&s;s of the publick, it is &s;carce ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that it is totally unju&s;t, &s;ince it is re|pugnant to <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> the dictates of <HI>nature,</HI> and the very principles of <HI>government.</HI></P>

<P>We come now to the fourth and la&s;t order of &s;laves, to <HI>pri&s;oners of war.</HI> As the <HI>&s;ellers</HI> lay a particular &s;tre&s;s on this order of men, and infer much, from its <HI>antiquity,</HI> in &s;upport of the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, we &s;hall examine the principle, on which it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the ancients. But as this principle was the &s;ame among all nations, and as a citation from many of their hi&s;tories would not be le&s;s tedious than unnece&s;&s;ary, we &s;hall &s;elect the ex|ample of the Romans for the con&s;ideration of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The law, by which pri&s;oners of war were &s;aid to be &s;entenced to &s;ervitude, was the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jure Gentium</HI> &s;ervi no&s;tri &s;unt, qui ab ho&s;tibus capiuntur.

<P>The principle, on which the law was e&s;tabli&s;hed, was the <HI>right of capture.</HI> When any of the contending par|ties had overcome their opponents, and were about to de&s;troy them, the right was con&s;idered to commence; a right, which the victors conceived them&s;elves to have, to recall their &s;words, and, from the con&s;ideration of having &s;aved the lives of the vanqui&s;hed, when they could have taken them by the laws of war, to commute

<P>It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, as a farther te&s;timony of the inju&s;tice of the mea&s;ure, that the Europeans, af|ter the introduction of Chri&s;tianity, exploded this prin|ciple of the ancients, as frivolous and fal&s;e; that they &s;pared the lives of the vanqui&s;hed, not from the &s;ordid motives of <HI>avarice,</HI> but from a con&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s, that homicide could only be ju&s;tified by <HI>nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> that they introduced an <HI>exchange</HI> of pri&s;oners, and, by many and wi&s;e regulations, deprived war of many of its former horrours.</P>
<P>But the advocates for &s;lavery, unable to defend them|&s;elves again&s;t the&s;e arguments, have fled to other re|&s;ources, and, ignorant of hi&s;tory, have denied that the <HI>right of capture</HI> was the true principle, on which &s;lavery &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the ancients. They rea&s;on thus "The learned Grotius, and others, have con&s;idered &s;lavery as the ju&s;t con&s;equence of a private war, (&s;uppo&s;ing the war to be ju&s;t and the opponents in a &s;tate of nature,) upon the principles of <HI>reparation</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hment.</HI> Now as the law of nature, which is the rule of conduct to individuals in &s;uch a &s;ituation, is applicable to members of a different community, there is rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, that the&s;e principles were applied by the ancients to their pri&s;oners of war; that their <HI>effects</HI> were confi&s;cated by the right of <HI>reparation,</HI> and their <HI>per&s;ons</HI> by the right of <HI>puni&s;hment."&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>But &s;uch a pre&s;umption is fal&s;e. The <HI>right of capture</HI> was the only argument, that the ancients adduced in their defence. Hence Polybius; <Q>What mu&s;t they, (the Mantinen&s;es) &s;uffer, to receive the puni&s;hment they de&s;erve? Perhaps it will be &s;aid, <HI>that they mu&s;t be &s;old, when they are taken, with their wives and
<PB N="67" REF="019561_0064_0FABFBEA75E83778">children into &s;lavery:</HI> But this is not to be con&s;idered as a puni&s;hment, &s;ince even tho&s;e &s;uffer it, by the laws of war, who have done nothing that is ba&s;e.</Q> The truth is, that both the <HI>offending</HI> and the <HI>offended</HI> parties, whenever they were victorious, inflicted &s;lavery alike. But if the <HI>offending</HI> party inflicted &s;lavery on the per&s;ons of the vanqi&s;hed, by what right did they inflict it? It mu&s;t be an&s;wered from the pre&s;umption before-menti|oned, "by the right of <HI>reparation,</HI> or of <HI>puni&s;hment:</HI>" an an&s;wer plainly ab&s;urd and contradictory, as it &s;uppo&s;es the <HI>aggre&s;&s;or</HI> to have a <HI>right,</HI> which the <HI>injured</HI> only could po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Neither is the argument le&s;s fallacious than the pre|&s;umption, in applying the&s;e principles, which in a <HI>publick</HI> war could belong to the <HI>publick</HI> only, to the per&s;ons of the <HI>individuals</HI> that were taken. This calls us again to the hi&s;tory of the ancients, and, as the rights of repa|ration and puni&s;hment could extend to tho&s;e only, who had been injured, to &s;elect a particular in&s;tance for the con&s;ideration of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>As the Romans had been injured without a previous provocation by the conduct of Hannibal at Saguntum, we may take the treaty into con&s;ideration, which they made with the Carthaginians, when the latter, defeated at Zama, &s;ued for peace. It con&s;i&s;ted of three articles.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Ut lib<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ri &s;uis legibus viverent. Livy, L. 30. 37.

By the &s;econd, they were to pay a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, as a reparation for the damages and expence of the war: and, by the third, they were to deliver up their elephants and &s;hips of war, and to be &s;ubject to various re&s;trictions, as a puni&s;hment. With the&s;e terms they complied, and the war was fini&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="019561_0065_0FABFBEB6B517E28">
Thus then did the Romans make that di&s;tinction be|tween <HI>private</HI> and <HI>publick</HI> war, which was nece&s;&s;ary to be made, and which the argument is fallacious in not &s;uppo&s;ing. The <HI>trea&s;ury</HI> of the vanqui&s;hed was marked as the means of <HI>reparation;</HI> and as this trea&s;ury was &s;up|plied, in a great mea&s;ure, by the impo&s;ition of taxes, and was, wholly, the property of the <HI>publick,</HI> &s;o the <HI>publick</HI> made the reparation that was due. The <HI>elephants</HI> al&s;o, and <HI>&s;hips of war,</HI> which were marked as the means of <HI>puni&s;h|ment,</HI> were <HI>publick</HI> property; and as they were con&s;iderable in&s;truments of &s;ecurity and defence to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and of annoyance to an enemy, &s;o their lo&s;s, added to the re&s;trictions of the treaty, operated as a great and <HI>publick</HI> puni&s;hment. But with re&s;pect to the Carthagini|an pri&s;oners, who had been taken in the war, they were retained in <HI>&s;ervitude:</HI> not upon the principles of <HI>repara|tion</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hment,</HI> becau&s;e the Romans had already re|ceived, by their own confe&s;&s;ion in the treaty, a &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction: not upon the&s;e principles, becau&s;e they were inapplicable to <HI>individuals:</HI> the legionary &s;oldier in the &s;ervice of the injured, who took his pri&s;oner, was not the per&s;on, to whom the <HI>injury had been done,</HI> any more than the &s;oldier in the &s;ervice of the aggre&s;&s;ors, who was taken, was the per&s;on, who had <HI>committed the of|fence:</HI> but they were retained in &s;ervitude by the <HI>right of capture;</HI> becau&s;e, when both parties had &s;ent their mili|tary into the field to determine the di&s;pute, it was at the <HI>private</HI> choice of the legionary &s;oldier before-mentioned, whether he would &s;pare the life of his conquered oppo|nent, when he was thought to be entitled to take it, if he had cho&s;en, by the laws of war.</P>
<P>To produce more in&s;tances, as an illu&s;tration of the &s;ubject, or to go farther into the argument, would be to tre&s;pa&s;s upon the patience, as well as under&s;tanding of the reader. In <HI>a &s;tate of nature,</HI> where a man is &s;uppo&s;ed to commit an injury, and to be unconnected with the re&s;t of the world, the act is <HI>private,</HI> and the right, which the injured acquires, can extend only to <HI>him&s;elf:</HI> but in <HI>a &s;tate of &s;ociety,</HI> where any member or members of a particular community give offence to tho&s;e
<PB N="69" REF="019561_0066_0FABFBEC281FAAE0">of another, and they are patronized by the &s;tate, to which they belong, the ca&s;e is altered; the act becomes immediately <HI>publick,</HI> and the <HI>publick</HI> alone are to expe|rience the con&s;equences of their inju&s;tice. For as no particular member of the community, if con&s;idered as an individual, is guilty, except the per&s;on, by whom the injury was done, it would be contrary to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, to apply the principles of <HI>reparation</HI> and <HI>puni&s;h|ment,</HI> which belong to the people as a collective body, to any individual of the community, who &s;hould happen to be taken. Now, as the principles of <HI>reparation</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> are thus inapplicable to the pri&s;oners, taken in a <HI>publick</HI> war, and as the <HI>right of capture,</HI> as we have &s;hewn before, is in&s;ufficient to intitle the victors to the <HI>&s;ervice</HI> of the vanqui&s;hed, it is evident that <HI>&s;lavery</HI> can|not ju&s;tly exi&s;t at all, &s;ince there are no other maxims, on which it can be founded, even in the mo&s;t equitable wars.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e things are &s;o; if &s;lavery cannot be de|fended even in the mo&s;t <HI>equitable</HI> wars, what arguments will not be found again&s;t that &s;ervitude, which ari&s;es from tho&s;e, that are <HI>unju&s;t?</HI> Which ari&s;es from tho&s;e African wars, that relate to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject? The African princes, corrupted by the merchants of Europe, &s;eek every opportunity of quarrelling with one another. Every &s;park is blown into a flame; and war is under|taken from no other con&s;ideration, than that <HI>of procuring &s;laves:</HI> while the Europeans, on the other hand, happy in the quarrels which they have thus excited, &s;upply them with arms and ammunition for the accompli&s;hment of their horrid purpo&s;e. Thus has Africa, for the &s;pace of two hundred years, been the &s;cene of the mo&s;t ini|quitous and bloody wars; and thus have many thou&s;ands of men, in the mo&s;t iniquitous manner, been &s;ent into &s;ervitude.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>We &s;hall beg leave, before we proceed to the argu|ments of the <HI>purcha&s;ers,</HI> to add the following ob&s;ervati|ons to the &s;ub&s;tance of the three preceding chapters.</P>
<P>As the two orders of men, of tho&s;e who are privately kidnapped by individuals, and of tho&s;e who are pub|lickly &s;eized by virtue of the authority of their prince, compo&s;e together, at lea&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The total annual exportation from Africa, is e&s;timated here at 100,000 men, two thirds of whom are exported by the Briti&s;h mer|chants alone. This e&s;timate is le&s;s than that which is u&s;ually made, and has been publi&s;hed. The author has been informed by di&s;intere&s;ted people, who were in mo&s;t of the We&s;t India i&s;lands during the late war, and who conver&s;ed with many of the mo&s;t intelligent of the negroes, for the purpo&s;e of inquiring by what methods they had ori|ginally been reduced to &s;lavery, that they did not find even two in twenty, who had been reduced to that &s;ituation, by any other means than tho&s;e mentioned above. The author, de&s;irous of a farther confirmation of this circum&s;tance, &s;topped the pre&s;s till he had writ|ten to another friend, who had re&s;ided twenty years in the We&s;t-In|dies, and who&s;e opinion he had not yet a&s;ked. The following is an extract from the an&s;wer. <Q>I do not among many hundreds re|collect to have &s;een but one or two &s;laves, of tho&s;e imported from Africa, who had any &s;cars to &s;hew, that they had been in war. They are generally &s;uch as are kidnapped, or &s;old by their tyrants, after the de&s;truction of a village. In &s;hort, I am firmly of opinion, that crimes and war together do not furni&s;h one &s;lave in an hundred of the numbers introduced into the European colo|nies. Of con&s;equence the trade it&s;elf, were it po&s;&s;ible to &s;up|po&s;e convicts or pri&s;oners of war to be ju&s;tly &s;entenced to &s;ervi|tude, is accountable for ninety-nine in every hundred &s;laves whom it &s;upplies. It is an in&s;ult to the publick, to attempt to palliate the in mod of procuring them.</Q></NOTE> nine tenths of the African &s;laves, they cannot contain, upon a moderate computa|tion, le&s;s than ninety thou&s;and men annually tran&s;port|ed: an immen&s;e number, but ea&s;ily to be credited, when we reflect that thou&s;ands are employed for the purpo&s;e of &s;tealing the unwary, and that the&s;e diabolical prac|tices are in force, &s;o far has European <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> been &s;pread, at the di&s;tance of a thou&s;and miles from the fac|tories
<PB N="71" REF="019561_0068_0FABFBED8262DED0">on the coa&s;t. The <HI>&s;lave merchants,</HI> among whom a quantity of European goods is previou&s;ly divided, tra|vel into the heart of the country to this amazing di&s;tance. Some of them attend the various markets, that are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed through &s;o large an extent of territory, to pur|cha&s;e the kidnapped people, whom the <HI>&s;lave-hunters</HI> are continually bringing in; while the re&s;t, &s;ubdividing their merchandize among the petty &s;overeigns with whom they deal, receive, by an immediate exertion of fraud and violence, the &s;tipulated number.</P>
<P>Now, will any man a&s;&s;ert, in oppo&s;ition to the argu|ments before advanced, that out of this immen&s;e body of men, thus annually collected and tran&s;ported, there is even <HI>one,</HI> over whom the original or &s;ub&s;equent &s;eller can have any power or right? Whoever a&s;&s;erts this, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, mu&s;t contradict his own feelings, and mu&s;t con&s;ider <HI>him&s;elf</HI> as a ju&s;t object of prey, whenever any daring invader &s;hall think it proper to attack <HI>him.</HI> And, in the &s;econd in&s;tance, the very idea which the African princes entertain of their villages, as <HI>parks</HI> or <HI>re&s;ervoirs,</HI> &s;tocked only for their own convenience, and of their &s;ubjects, as <HI>wild bea&s;ts,</HI> whom they may pur&s;ue and take at plea&s;ure, is &s;o &s;hocking, that it need only be mentioned, to be in&s;tantly reprobated by the rea|der.</P>
<P>The order of &s;laves, which is next to the former in re&s;pect to the number of people whom it contains, is that of pri&s;oners of war. This order, if the former &s;tatement be true, is more incon&s;iderable than is gene|rally imagined; but whoever reflects on the prodigious &s;laughter that is con&s;tantly made in every African &s;kir|mi&s;h, cannot be otherwi&s;e than of this opinion: he will find, that where <HI>ten</HI> are taken, he has every rea&s;on to pre&s;ume that an <HI>hundred</HI> peri&s;h. In &s;ome of the&s;e &s;kir|mi&s;hes, though they have been begun for the expre&s;s pur|po&s;e of <HI>precuring &s;laves,</HI> the conquerors have &s;uffered but few of the vanqui&s;hed to e&s;cape the fury of the &s;word; and there have not been wanting in&s;tances, where they have been &s;o incen&s;ed at the re&s;i&s;tance they have found, that their &s;pirit of vengeance has entirely got the better
<PB N="72" REF="019561_0069_0FABFBEE80CAD1E0">of their avarice, and they have murdered, in cool blood, every individual, without di&s;crimination, either of age or &s;ex.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The writer of the letter of which this is a faithful extract, and who was known to the author of the pre&s;ent E&s;&s;ay, was a long time on the African coa&s;t. He had once the misfortune to be &s;hipwrecked there, and to be taken by the natives, who conveyed him and his companions a con&s;iderable way up into the country. The hard&s;hips which he underwent in the march, his treatment during his captivity, the &s;cencs to which he was witne&s;s, while he retided among the in|land Africans, as well as while in the African trade, gave occa&s;ion to a &s;eries of very intere&s;ting letters. The&s;e letters were &s;ent to the author of the pre&s;ent E&s;&s;ay, with liberty to make what u&s;e of them he cho&s;e, by the gentleman to whom they were written.</NOTE> The following is an account of one of the&s;e &s;kir|mi&s;hes, as de&s;cribed by a per&s;on, who was witne&s;s to the &s;cene. <Q>I was &s;ent, with &s;everal others, in a &s;mall &s;loop up the river Niger, to purcha&s;e &s;laves: we had &s;ome free negroes with us in the practice; and as the ve&s;&s;els are liable to frequent attacks from the negroes on one &s;ide of the river, or Moors on the other, they are all armed. As we rode at anchor a long way up the river, we ob&s;erved a large number of negroes in huts by the river's &s;ide, and for our own &s;afety kept a wary eye on them. Early next morning we &s;aw from our ma&s;t-head a numerous body approaching, with apparently but little order, but in clo&s;e array. They approached very fa&s;t, and fell furiou&s;ly on the inhabitants of the town, who &s;eemed to be quite <HI>&s;urprized,</HI> but neverthele&s;s, as &s;oon as they could get together, fought &s;toutly. They had &s;ome fire-arms, but made very little u&s;e of them, as they came directly to clo&s;e fighting with their &s;pears, lances, and &s;abres. Many of the invaders were mounted on &s;mall hor&s;es; and both parties fought for about half an hour with the fierce&s;t animo&s;ity, exerting much more courage and per&s;everance than I had ever before been witne&s;s to among&s;t them. The women and children of the town clu&s;tered together to the water's edge, running &s;hrieking up and down with terrour, waiting the event
<PB N="73" REF="019561_0070_0FABFBEEF987A170">of the combat, till their party gave way and took to the water, to endeavour to &s;wim over to the Barbary &s;ide. They were clo&s;ely pur&s;ued even into the river by the victors, who, though they came for the pur|po&s;e of <HI>getting &s;laves,</HI> gave no quarter, <HI>their cruelty even prevailing over their avarice.</HI> They made no pri|&s;oners, but put all to the &s;word without mercy. Hor|rible indeed was the carnage of the vanqui&s;hed on this occa&s;ion, and as we were within two or three hundred yards of them, their cries and &s;hrieks affect|ed us extremely. We had got up our anchor at the beginning of the fray, and now &s;tood clo&s;e in to the &s;pot, where the victors having followed the vanqui&s;h|ed into the water, were continually dragging out and murdering tho&s;e, whom by rea&s;on of their wounds they ea&s;ily overtook. The very children, whom they took in great numbers, did not e&s;cape the maffacre. Enraged at their barbarity, we fired our guns loaden with grape-&s;hot, and a volley of &s;mall arms among them, which effectually checked their ardour, and obliged them to retire to a di&s;tance from the &s;hore; from whence a few round cannon &s;hot &s;oon removed them into the woods. The whole river was black over with the heads of the fugitives, who were &s;wim|ming for their lives. The&s;e poor wretches, fearing <HI>us</HI> as much as their conquerors, dived when we fired, and cried mo&s;t lamentably for mercy. Having now effectually favoured their retreat, we &s;tood back|wards and forwards, and took up &s;everal that were wounded and tired. All who&s;e wounds had di&s;abled them from &s;wimming, were either butchered or drowned, before we got up to them. With a ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity, <HI>never I believe before heard of among &s;lavers,</HI> we gave tho&s;e their liberty whom we had taken up, &s;etting them on &s;hore on the Barbary &s;ide, among the poor re&s;idue of their companions, who had &s;urvived the &s;laughter of the morning.</Q></P>
<P>We &s;hall make but two remarks on this horrid in|&s;tance of African cruelty. It adds, fir&s;t, a con&s;iderable weight to the &s;tatements that have been made; and
<PB N="74" REF="019561_0071_0FABFBEFB9157AC8">confirms, &s;econdly, the conclu&s;ions that were drawn in the preceding chapter. For if we even allow the right of capture to be ju&s;t and the principles of reparation and puni&s;hment to be applicable to the individuals of a community, yet would the former be unju&s;t, and the latter inapplicable, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Every African war is a robbery; and we may add, to our former ex|pre&s;&s;ion, when we &s;aid, <Q>that thus have many thou|&s;ands of men, in the mo&s;t iniquitous manner, been &s;ent into &s;ervitude,</Q> that we believe there are few of this order, who are not as much the examples of inju&s;tice, as the people that have been kidnapped; and who do not additionally convey, when we con&s;ider them as pri&s;oners of war, an idea of the mo&s;t complicated &s;cene of murder.</P>
<P>The order of <HI>convicts,</HI> as it exi&s;ts almo&s;t &s;olely among tho&s;e princes, who&s;e dominions are contugious to the European factories, is from this circum&s;tance &s;o incon|&s;iderable, when compared with either of the preceding, that we &s;hould not have mentioned it again, but that we were unwilling to omit any additional argument that occurred again&s;t it.</P>
<P>It has been &s;hewn already, that the puni&s;hment of &s;lavery is inflicted from no other motive, than that of gratifying the <HI>avarice</HI> of the prince, a con&s;ideration &s;o dete&s;table, as to be &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to prove it to be unju&s;t; and that it is &s;o di&s;proportionate, from its <HI>nature,</HI> to the offence, as to afford an additional proof of its inju&s;tice. We &s;hall add now, as a &s;econd argument, its di&s;proportion from its <HI>continuance:</HI> and we &s;hall derive a third from the con&s;ideration, that, in civil &s;ociety, every violation of the laws of the community is an offence again&s;t the <HI>&s;tatc.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Were this not the ca&s;e, the government of a country could have no right to take cognizance of crimes, and puni&s;h them, but every individual, if injured, would have a right to puni&s;h the ag|gre&s;&s;or with his own hand, which is contrary to the notions of all civilized men, whether among the ancients or the moderns.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e then an African prince, di&s;daining for once the idea of emolument: let us &s;uppo&s;e him for once
<PB N="75" REF="019561_0072_0FABFBFAC93116A0">inflamed with the love of his country, and re&s;olving to puni&s;h from this principle alone, <Q>that by exhibiting an example of terrour, he may pre&s;erve that <HI>happine&s;s of the publick,</HI> which he is bound to &s;ecure and defend by the very nature of his contract; or, in other words, that he may an&s;wer the end of government.</Q> If ac|tuated then by this principle, he &s;hould adjudge &s;lavery to an offender, as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for his offence, for who&s;e benefit mu&s;t the convict labour? If it be an&s;wer|ed, "for the benefit of the &s;tate," we allow that the puni&s;hment, in whatever light it is con&s;idered, will be found to be equitable: but if it be an&s;wered, <Q>for the benefit of any <HI>individual whom he plea&s;es to appoint,</HI></Q> we deny it to be ju&s;t. The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;ame notion is entertained even by the African princes, who do not permit the per&s;on injured to revenge his injury, or to receive the convict as his &s;lave. But if the very per&s;on who has been <HI>injured,</HI> does not po&s;&s;e&s;s him, much le&s;s ought any other per|&s;on what&s;oever.</NOTE> &s;tate alone is con&s;idered to have been injured, and as <HI>injuries cannot po&s;&s;ibly be transferred,</HI> the &s;tate alone can ju&s;tly receive the advan|tages of his labour. But if the African prince, when he thus condemns him to labour for the benefit of an <HI>unoffended individual,</HI> &s;hould at the &s;ame time &s;entence him to become his <HI>property;</HI> that is, if he &s;hould make the per&s;on and life of the convict at the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of him, for whom he has &s;entenced him to labour; it is evident that, in addition to his former inju&s;tice, he is u&s;urping a power, which no ruler or rulers of a &s;tate can po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which the great Creator of the univer&s;e never yet gave to any order whatever of created beings.</P>
<P>That this rea&s;oning is true, and that civilized nations have con&s;idered it as &s;uch, will be be&s;t te&s;tified by their practice. We may appeal here to that <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> which is now adjudged to delinquents, as a puni&s;hment, among many of the &s;tates of Europe.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>It remains only now to examine by what arguments tho&s;e, who <HI>receive</HI> or <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> their fellow-creatures into &s;lavery, defend the <HI>commerce.</HI> Their fir&s;t plea is, <Q>that they receive tho&s;e with propriety, who are convicted of crimes, becau&s;e they are delivered into their hands by <HI>their own magi&s;trates.</HI></Q> But what is this to you <HI>receivers?</HI> Have the unfortunate <HI>convicts</HI> been guilty of injury to <HI>you?</HI> Have they broken <HI>your</HI> treaties? Have they plundered <HI>your</HI> &s;hips? Have they carried <HI>your</HI> wives and children into &s;lavery, that <HI>you</HI> &s;hould thus retaliate? Have they offended <HI>you</HI> even by word or ge&s;ture?</P>
<P>But if the African convicts are innocent with re&s;pect to you; if you have not even the &s;hadow of a claim upon their per&s;ons; by what right do you receive them? "By the laws of the Africans." you will &s;ay; <Q>by which it is po&s;itively allowed.</Q> &mdash; But can <HI>laws</HI> alter the nature of vice? They may give it a &s;anction perhaps: it will &s;till be immutably the &s;ame, and, though dre&s;&s;ed in the outward habiliments of <HI>honour,</HI> will &s;till be <HI>intrin|&s;ically ba&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But alas! you do not only attempt to defend your|&s;elves by the&s;e arguments, but even dare to give your actions the appearance of lenity, and a&s;&s;ume <HI>merit</HI> from your <HI>ba&s;ene&s;s!</HI> and how fir&s;t ought you particularly to blu&s;h, when you a&s;&s;ert, <Q>that pri&s;oners of war are only purcha&s;ed from the hands of their conquerors, <HI>to de|liver them from death.</HI></Q> Ridiculous defence! can the
<PB N="78" REF="019561_0075_0FABFBFCDAD556C8">mo&s;t credulous believe it? You entice the Africans to war; you foment their quarrels; you &s;upply them with arms and ammunition, and all&mdash;from the <HI>motives of be|nevolence.</HI> Does a man &s;et fire to an hou&s;e, for the pur|po&s;e of re&s;cuing the inhabitants from the flames? But if they are only purcha&s;ed, to <HI>deliver them from death;</HI> why, when they are delivered into your hands, as pro|tectors, do you torture them with hunger? Why do you kill them with fatigue? Why does the whip deform their bodies, or the knife their limbs? Why do you &s;entence them to death? to a death, infinitely more excruciating than that from which you &s;o kindly &s;aved them? What an&s;wer do you make to this? for if you had not hu|manely pre&s;erved them from the hands of their conquer|ors, a quick death perhaps, and that in the &s;pace of a moment, had freed them from their pain: but on ac|count of your <HI>favour</HI> and <HI>benevolence,</HI> it is known, that they have lingered years in pain and agony, and have been &s;entenced, at la&s;t, to a dreadful death for the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant offence.</P>
<P>Neither can we allow the other argument to be true, on which you found your merit; <Q>that you take them from their country for their own convenience; be|cau&s;e Africa, &s;corched with ince&s;&s;ant heat, and &s;ub|ject to the mo&s;t violent rains and tempe&s;ts, is unwhole|&s;ome, and unfit to be inhabited.</Q> Prepo&s;terous men! do you thus judge from your own feelings? Do you thus judge from your own con&s;titution and frame? But if you &s;uppo&s;e that the Africans are incapable of enduring their own climate, becau&s;e you cannot endure it your&s;elves; why do you receive them into &s;lavery? Why do you not mea&s;ure them here by the &s;ame &s;tandard? For if you are unable to bear hunger and thir&s;t, chains and impri|&s;onment, wounds and torture, why do you not &s;uppo&s;e them incapable of enduring the &s;ame treatment? Thus then is your argument turned again&s;t your&s;elves. But con&s;ider the an&s;wer which the Scythians gave the Aegypti|ans, when they contended about the antiquity of their original,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ju&s;tin, L. 2. C. 1.</NOTE> <Q>That nature, when &s;he fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="79" REF="019561_0076_0FABFBFD6201B428">countries by different degrees of heat and cold, tem|pered the bodies of animals, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, to endure the different &s;ituations: that as the climate of Scythia was &s;everer than that of Aegypt, &s;o were the bodies of the Scythians harder, and as capable of en|during the &s;everity of their atmo&s;phere, as the Aegyp|tians the temperatene&s;s of their own</Q></P>
<P>But you may &s;ay perhaps, that, though they are ca|pable of enduring their own climate, yet their &s;ituation is frequently uncomfortable, and even wretched: that Africa is infe&s;ted with locu&s;ts, and in&s;ects of various kinds; that they &s;ettle in &s;warms upon the trees, de&s;troy the verdure, con&s;ume the fruit, and deprive the inhabi|tants of their food. But the &s;ame an&s;wer may be ap|plied as before; "that the &s;ame kind Providence, who tempered the body of the animal, tempered al&s;o the bo|dy of the tree; that he gave it a quality to recover the bite of the locu&s;t, which he &s;ent; and to rea&s;&s;ume, in a &s;hort interval of time, its former glory." And that &s;uch is the ca&s;e experience has &s;hewn: for the very trees that have been infe&s;ted, and &s;tripped of their bloom and ver|dure, &s;o &s;urprizingly quick is vegetation, appear in a few days, as if an in&s;ect had been utterly unknown.</P>
<P>We may add to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, from the te&s;timony of tho&s;e who have written the Hi&s;tory of Africa from their own in&s;pection, that no country is more luxurious in pro&s;pects, none more fruitful, none more rich in herds and flocks, and none, where the comforts of life can be gained with &s;o little trouble.</P>
<P>But you &s;ay again, as a confirmation of the&s;e your former arguments, (by which you would have it under|&s;tood, that the Africans them&s;elves are &s;en&s;ible of the goodne&s;s of your intentions) <Q>that they do not appear to go with you again&s;t their will.</Q> Impudent and ba&s;e a&s;&s;ertion! Why then do you load them with chains? Why keep you your daily and nightly watches? But alas, as a farther, though a more melancholy proof, of the fal&s;ehood of your a&s;&s;ertions, how many, when on board your &s;hips, have put a period to their exi&s;tence? How many have leaped into the &s;ea? How many have
<PB N="80" REF="019561_0077_0FABFC04A91A8988">pined to death, that, even at the expence of their lives, they might fly from your <HI>benevolence?</HI></P>
<P>Do you call them ob&s;tinate then, becau&s;e they refu&s;e your favours? Do you call them ungrateful, becau&s;e they make you this return? How much rather ought you receivers to blu&s;h! How much rather ought you receivers to be con&s;idered as abandoned and execrable; who, when you u&s;urp the dominion over tho&s;e, who are as free and independent as your&s;elves, break the fir&s;t law of ju&s;tice, which ordains, <Q>that no per&s;on &s;hall do harm to another, without a previous provocation;</Q> who offend again&s;t the dictates of nature, which com|mands, <Q>that no ju&s;t man &s;hall be given or received into &s;lavery again&s;t his own con&s;ent;</Q> and who vio|late the very laws of the empire that you a&s;&s;ume, by con&s;igning your &s;ubjects to mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Now, as a famous Heathen philo&s;opher ob&s;erves, from who&s;e mouth you &s;hall be convicted,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cicero de Officiis. L. 1. C. 8.</NOTE> <Q>there is a con|&s;iderable difference, whether an injury is done, during any perturbation of mind, which is generally &s;hort and momentary; or whether it is done with any pre|vious meditation and de&s;ign; for, tho&s;e crimes, which proceed from any &s;udden commotion of the mind, are le&s;s than tho&s;e, which are &s;tudied and prepared,</Q> how great and enormous are your crimes to be con|&s;idered, who plan your African voyages at a time, when your rea&s;on is &s;ound, and your &s;en&s;es are awake; who coolly and deliberately equip your ve&s;&s;els; and who &s;pend years, and even lives, in the traffick of <HI>human liberty.</HI></P>
<P>But if the arguments of tho&s;e, who <HI>&s;ell</HI> or <HI>deliver</HI> men into &s;lavery, (as we have &s;hewn before) and of tho&s;e, who <HI>receive</HI> or <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> them, (as we have now &s;hewn) are wholly fal&s;e; it is evident that this <HI>commerce,</HI> is not only beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of defence, but is ju&s;tly to be accounted wicked, and ju&s;tly impious, &s;ince it is contrary to the priciples of <HI>law</HI> and <HI>government,</HI> the dictates of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> the common maxims of <HI>equity,</HI> the laws of <HI>nature,</HI> the admonitions of <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> and, in &s;hort, the whole doctrine of <HI>natural religion.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PART III. THE SLAVERY OF THE AFRICANS IN THE EUROPEAN COLONIES.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING confined our&s;elves wholly, in the &s;econd part of this E&s;&s;ay, to the con&s;ideration of the <HI>com|merce,</HI> we &s;hall now proceed to the con&s;ideration of the <HI>&s;lavery</HI> that is founded upon it. As this &s;lavery will be con&s;picuous in the <HI>treatment,</HI> which the unfortunate Afri|cans uniformly undergo, when they are put in the hands of the <HI>receivers,</HI> we &s;hall de&s;cribe the manner in which they are accu&s;tomed to be u&s;ed from this period.</P>
<P>To place this in the cleare&s;t, and mo&s;t con&s;picuous point of view, we &s;hall throw a con&s;iderable part of our information on this head into the form of a narrative: we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves, in &s;hort, on the continent of Africa, and relate a &s;cene, which, from its agreement with unque&s;tionable facts, might not unrea&s;onably be pre&s;umed to have been pre&s;ented to our view, had we been really there.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, let us turn our eyes to the cloud of du&s;t that is before us. It &s;eems to advance rapidly, and, ac|companied with di&s;mal &s;hrieks and yellings, to make the very air, that is above it, tremble as it rolls along. What can po&s;&s;ibly be the cau&s;e? Let us inquire of that
<PB N="82" REF="019561_0079_0FABFC056F5A6BD8">melancholy African, who &s;eems to walk dejected near the &s;hore; who&s;e eyes are &s;tedfa&s;tly fixed on the ap|proaching object, and who&s;e heart, if we can judge from the appearance of his countenance, mu&s;t be great|ly agitated.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;ays the unhappy African, <Q>the cloud that that you &s;ee approaching, is a train of wretched &s;laves. They are going to the &s;hips behind you. They are de&s;tined for the Engli&s;h colonies, and, if you will &s;tay here but for a little time, you will &s;ee them pa&s;s. They were la&s;t night drawn up upon the plain which you &s;ee before you, where they were branded upon the brea&s;t with an <HI>hot iron;</HI> and when they had un|dergone the whole of the treatment which is cu&s;tom|ary on the&s;e occa&s;ions, and which I am informed that you Engli&s;hmen at home u&s;e to the <HI>cattle</HI> which you buy, they were returned to their pri&s;on. As I have &s;ome dealings with the members of the factory which you &s;ee at a little di&s;tance, (though thanks to the Great Spirit, I never dealt in the <HI>liberty</HI> of my fellow creatures) I gained admittance there. I learn|ed the hi&s;tory of &s;ome of the unfortunate people, whom I &s;aw confined, and will explain to you, if my eye &s;hould catch them as they pa&s;s, the real cau&s;es of their &s;ervitude.</Q></P>
<P>Scarcely were the&s;e words &s;poken, when they came di&s;tinctly into &s;ight. They appeared to advance in a long column, but in a very irregular manner. There were three only in the front, and the&s;e were chained together. The re&s;t that followed &s;eemed to be chained by pairs, but by pre&s;&s;ing forward, to avoid the la&s;h of the drivers, the breadth of the column began to be greatly extended, and ten or more were ob&s;erved abrea&s;t.</P>
<P>While we were making tho&s;e remarks, the intelligent African thus re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e. <Q>The fir&s;t three whom you ob&s;erve, at the head of the train, to be chained together, are pri&s;oners of war. As &s;oon as the &s;hips that are behind you arrived, the news was di&s;|patched into the inland country; when one of the
<PB N="83" REF="019561_0080_0FABFC07E2158E30">petty kings immediately a&s;&s;embled his &s;ubjects, and attacked a neighbouring tribe. The wretched people, though they were &s;urprized, made a formidable re|&s;i&s;tance, as they re&s;olved, almo&s;t all of them, rather to lo&s;e their lives, than &s;urvive their liberty. The per&s;on whom you &s;ee in the middle, is the father of the two young men, who are chained to him on each &s;ide. His wife and two of his children were killed in the attack, and his father being wounded, and, on account of his age, <HI>incapable of &s;ervitude,</HI> was left bleeding on the &s;pot where this tran&s;action happen|ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>With re&s;pect to tho&s;e who are now pa&s;&s;ing us, and are immediately behind the former, I can give you no other intelligence, than that &s;ome of them, to about the number of thirty, were taken in the &s;ame &s;kirmi&s;h. Their tribe was &s;aid to have been numerous before the attack; the&s;e however are <HI>all that are left alive.</HI> But with re&s;pect to the unhappy man, who is now oppo&s;ite to us, and whom you may di&s;tingui&s;h, as he is now looking back and wringing his hands in de|&s;pair, I can inform you with more preci&s;ion. He is an unfortunate convict. He lived only about five days journey from the factory. He went out with his king to hunt, and was one of his train; but, through too great an anxiety to afford his royal ma|&s;ter diver&s;ion, he rou&s;ed the game from the covert rather &s;ooner than was expected. The king, exa&s;|perated at this circum&s;tance, &s;entenced him to &s;lavery. His wife and children, fearing le&s;t the tyrant &s;hould extend the puni&s;hment to them&s;elves, <HI>which is not un|u&s;ual,</HI> &s;led directly to the woods, where they were all devoured.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The people, whom you &s;ee clo&s;e behind the un|happy convict, form a numerous body, and reach a con&s;iderable way. They &s;peak a language, which no per&s;on in this part of Africa can under&s;tand, and their features, as you perceive, are &s;o different from tho&s;e of the re&s;t, that they almo&s;t appear a di&s;tinct race of men. From this circum&s;tance I recollect them. They
<PB N="84" REF="019561_0081_0FABFC098AECF770">are the &s;ubjects of a very di&s;tant prince, who agreed with the <HI>&s;lave merchants, for a quantity of &s;pirituous liquors,</HI> to furni&s;h him with a &s;tipulated number of &s;laves. He accordingly &s;urrounded, and &s;et fire to one of his own villages in the night, and &s;eized the&s;e people, who were unfortunately the inhabitants, as they were e&s;caping from the flames. I fir&s;t &s;aw them as the merchants were driving them in, about two days ago. They came in a large body, and were tied together at the neck with leather thongs, which permitted them to walk at the di&s;tance of about a yard from one another. Many of them were loaden with elephants teeth, which had been purcha&s;ed at the &s;ame time. All of them had bags, made of &s;kin, upon their &s;houlders; for as they were to travel, in their way from the great mountains, through barren &s;ands and inho&s;pitable woods for many days together, they were obliged to carry water and provi&s;ions with them. Notwith&s;tanding this, many of them peri&s;hed, &s;ome by hunger, but the greate&s;t number by fatigue, as the place from whence they came, is at &s;uch an amazing di&s;tance from this, and the ob&s;tacles, from the nature of the country, &s;o great, that the journey could &s;carcely be completed in &s;even moons.</Q></P>
<P>When this relation was fini&s;hed, and we had been looking &s;tedfa&s;tly for &s;ome time on the croud that was going by, we lo&s;t fight of that peculiarity of feature, which we had before remarked. We then di&s;covered that the inhabitants of the depopulated village had all of them pa&s;&s;ed us, and that the part of the train, to which we were now oppo&s;ite, was a numerous body of kid|napped people. Here we indulged our imagination. We thought we beheld in one of them a father, in ano|ther an hu&s;band, and in another a &s;on, each of whom was forced from his various and tender connections, and without even the opportunity of bidding them adieu. While we were engaged in the&s;e and other melancholy reflections, the whole body of &s;laves had entirely pa&s;&s;ed us. We turned almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly to look at them again, when we di&s;covered an unhappy man at the end of the
<PB N="85" REF="019561_0082_0FABFC09F453ACF8">train, who could &s;carcely keep pace with the re&s;t. His feet &s;eemed to have &s;uffered much from long and con|&s;tant travelling, for he was limping painfully along.</P>
<P><Q>This man, re&s;umes the African, has travelled a con&s;iderable way. He lived at a great di&s;tance from hence, and had a large family, for whom he was dai|ly to provide. As he went out one night to a neigh|bouring &s;pring, to procure water for his thir&s;ty chil|dren, he was kidnapped by two <HI>&s;lave hunters,</HI> who &s;old him in the morning to &s;ome country merchants for a <HI>bar of iron.</HI> The&s;e drove him with other &s;laves, procured almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner, to the neare&s;t market, where the Engli&s;h merchants, to whom the train that has ju&s;t now pa&s;&s;ed us belongs, purcha&s;ed him and two others, by means of their travelling agents, for a <HI>pi&s;tol.</HI> His wife and children have been long waiting for his return. But he is gone for ever from their &s;ight: and they mu&s;t be now di&s;con&s;olate, as they mu&s;t be certain by his delay, that he has fal|len into the hands of the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>And now, as I have mentioned the name of <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> a name, by which the Europeans di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from us, I could wi&s;h to be informed of the meaning which &s;uch an appellation may convey. They con&s;ider them&s;elves as <HI>men,</HI> but us unfortunate Africans, whom they term <HI>Heathens,</HI> as the <HI>bea&s;ts</HI> that &s;erve us. But ah! how different is the fact! What is <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> but a &s;y&s;tem of <HI>murder</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion?</HI> The cries and yells of the unfortunate people, who are now &s;oon to embark for the regions of &s;ervitude, have already pierced my heart. Have you not heard me &s;igh, while we have been talking? Do you not &s;ee the tears that now trickle down my cheeks? and yet the&s;e hardened <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> are unable to be moved at all: nay, they will &s;courge them amid&s;t their groans, and even &s;mile, while they are torturing them to death. Happy, happy Heatheni&s;m? which can dete&s;t the vices of Chri&s;tianity, and feel for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of man|kind.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="019561_0083_0FABFC0AF0B646A0">
"But" we reply, <Q>You are totally mi&s;taken: <HI>Chri&s;|tianity</HI> is the mo&s;t perfect and lovely of moral &s;y&s;tems. It ble&s;&s;es even the hand of per&s;ecution it&s;elf, and re|turns good for evil. But the people again&s;t whom you &s;o ju&s;tly declaim, are not <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> They are <HI>infidels.</HI> They are <HI>mon&s;ters.</HI> They are out of the common cour&s;e of nature. Their countrymen at home are generous and brave. They &s;upport the &s;ick, the lame, and the blind. They &s;ly to the &s;uccour of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. They have noble and &s;tately buildings for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of benevolence. They are in &s;hort, of all nations, the mo&s;t remarkable for humanity and ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>"But why then," replies the hone&s;t African, <Q>do they &s;uffer this? Why is Africa a &s;cene of blood and de&s;olation? Why are her children wre&s;ted from her, to admini&s;ter to the luxuries and greatne&s;s of tho&s;e whom they never offended? And why are the&s;e di&s;|mal cries in vain?</Q></P>
<P>"Alas!" we reply again, <Q>can the cries and groans, with which the air now trembles, be heard acro&s;s this exten&s;ive continent? Can the &s;outhern winds convey them to the ear of Britain? If they could reach the generous Engli&s;hman at home, they would pierce his heart, as they have already pierced your own. He would &s;ympathize with you in your di&s;tre&s;s. He would be enraged at the conduct of his countrymen, and re&s;i&s;t their tyranny.</Q></P>
<P>But here a &s;hriek unu&s;ually loud, accompanied with a dreadful rattling of chains, interrupted the di&s;cour&s;e. The wretched Africans were ju&s;t about to embark: they had turned their face to their country, as if to take a la&s;t adieu, and, with arms uplifted to the &s;ky, were making the very atmo&s;phere re&s;ound with their prayers and imprecations.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>The foregoing &s;cene, though it may be &s;aid to be imaginary, is &s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent with fact. It is a &s;cene, to which the reader him&s;elf may have been witne&s;s, if he has ever vi&s;ited the place, where it is &s;uppo&s;ed to lie; as no circum&s;tance whatever has been in&s;erted in it, for which the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t undeniable evidence cannot be produced. We &s;hall proceed now to de&s;cribe, in general terms, the treatment which the wretched Afri|cans undergo, from the time of their embarkation.</P>
<P>When the African &s;laves, who are collected from va|rious quarters, for the purpo&s;es of &s;ale, are delivered over to the <HI>receivers,</HI> they are conducted in the manner above de&s;cibed to the &s;hips. Their &s;ituation on board is beyond all de&s;cription: for here they are crouded, hundreds of them together, into &s;uch a &s;mall compa&s;s, as would &s;carcely be thought &s;ufficient to accommodate twenty, if con&s;idered as <HI>free men.</HI> This confinement &s;oon produces an effect, that may be ea&s;ily imagined. It generates a pe&s;tilential air, which, co-operating with bad provi&s;ions, occa&s;ions &s;uch a &s;ickne&s;s and mortality among them, that not le&s;s than<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is univer&s;ally allowed, that at lea&s;t one fifth of the exported negroes peri&s;h in the pa&s;&s;age. This e&s;timate is made from the time in which they are put an board, to the time when they are di&s;po&s;ed of in the colonies. The French are &s;uppo&s;ed to lo&s;e the greate&s;t number in the voyage, but particularly from this circum&s;tance, be|cau&s;e their &s;lave &s;hips are in general &s;o very large, that many of the &s;laves that have been put on board &s;ickly, die before the cargo can be completed.</NOTE><HI>twenty thou&s;and</HI> are generally taken off in every yearly tran&s;portation.</P>
<P>Thus confined in a pe&s;tilential pri&s;on, and almo&s;t en|tirely excluded from the chearful face of day, it remains for the &s;ickly &s;urvivors to linger out a mi&s;erable ex|i&s;tence, till the vovage is fini&s;hed. But are no farther evils to be expected in the interim, particularly if we add to their already wretched &s;ituation, the indignities
<PB N="88" REF="019561_0085_0FABFC0C64280AE0">that are daily offered them, and the regret which they mu&s;t con&s;tantly feel, at being for ever forced from their connexions? The&s;e evils are but too apparent. Some of them have re&s;olved, and, notwith&s;tanding the threats of the <HI>receivers,</HI> have carried their re&s;olves into executi|on, to &s;tarve them&s;elves to death. Others, when they have been brought upon deck for air, if the lea&s;t oppor|tunity has offered, have leaped into the &s;ea, and termi|nated their mi&s;eries at once. Others, in a fit of de&s;pair, have attempted to ri&s;e, and regain their liberty. But here what a &s;cene of barbarity has con&s;tantly en&s;ued.&mdash; Some of them have been in&s;tantly killed upon the &s;pot; &s;ome have been taken from the hold, have been brui&s;ed and mutilated in the mo&s;t barbarous and &s;hocking man|ner, and have been returned bleeding to their compani|ons, as a &s;ad example of re&s;i&s;tance; while others, tied to the ropes of the &s;hip, and mangled alternately with the whip and knife, have been left in that horrid &s;ituati|on, till they have expired.</P>
<P>But this is not the only inhuman treatment which they are frequently obliged to undergo; for if their &s;hould be any nece&s;&s;ity, from tempe&s;tuous weather, for lightening the &s;hip; or if it &s;hould be pre&s;umed on the voyage, that the provi&s;ions will fall &s;hort before the port can be made, they are, many of them, thrown into the &s;ea, without any compunction of mind on the part of the <HI>receivers,</HI> and without any other regret for their lo&s;s, than that which <HI>avarice</HI> in&s;pires. Wretched &s;urvivors! what mu&s;t be their feelings at &s;uch a &s;ight! how mu&s;t they tremble to think of that &s;ervitude which is approaching, when the very <HI>dogs</HI> of the <HI>receivers</HI> have been retained on board, and preferred to their unoffending countrymen. But indeed &s;o lightly are the&s;e unhappy people e&s;teemed, that their lives have been even taken away upon &s;pecu|lation: there has been an in&s;tance,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This in&s;tance happened in a &s;hip, commanded by one Colling|wood. On the 29th of November, 1781, fifty-four of them were thrown into the &s;ea alive; on the 30th forty-two more; and in about three days afterwards, twenty-&s;ix. Ten others, who were brought upon the deck for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, did not wait to be hand-cuffed, but bravely leaped into the &s;ea, and &s;hared the &s;ate of their com|panions. It is a fact, that the people on board this &s;hip had not been put upon &s;hort allowance. The excu&s;e which this execrable wretch made on board for his conduct, was the following, <Q><HI>that if the &s;lives, who were then &s;ickly, had died a natural death, the lo&s;s would have been the owners; but as they were thrown alive into the &s;ea it would fall upon the underwriters</HI></Q></NOTE> within the la&s;t five
<PB N="89" REF="019561_0086_0FABFC0D0E1CDE88">years, of <HI>one hundred and thirty-two</HI> of them being thrown into the &s;ea, becau&s;e it was &s;uppo&s;ed that, by this <HI>trick,</HI> their value could be recovered from the in|&s;urers.</P>
<P>But if the &s;hip &s;hould arrive &s;afe at its de&s;tined port, a circum&s;tance which does not always happen, (for &s;ome have been blown up, and many lo&s;t) the wretched Afri|cans do not find an alleviation of their &s;orrow. Here they are again expo&s;ed to &s;ale. Here they are again &s;ub|jected to the in&s;pection of other brutal <HI>receivers,</HI> who examine and treat them with an inhumanity, at which even avarice &s;hould blu&s;h. To this mortifying circum|&s;tance is added another, that they are picked out, as the purcha&s;er plea&s;es, with out any con&s;ideration whether the wife is &s;eparated from her hu&s;band, or the mother from her &s;on: and if the&s;e cruel in&s;tances of &s;eparation &s;hould happen; if relations, when they find them&s;elves about to be parted, &s;hould cling together; or if filial, conjugal, or parental affection, &s;hould detain them but a moment longer in each other's arms, than the&s;e <HI>&s;econd receivers</HI> &s;hould think &s;ufficient, the la&s;h in&s;tantly &s;evers them from their embrances.</P>
<P>We cannot clo&s;e our account of the treatment, which the wretched Africans undergo while in the hands of the <HI>fir&s;t receivers,</HI> without mentioning an in&s;tance of wanton barbarity, which happened &s;ome time ago; particularly as it may be in&s;erted with propriety in the pre&s;ent place, and may give the reader a better idea of the cruelties, to which they are continually expo&s;ed, than any that he may have yet conceived. To avoid making a mi&s;take, we &s;hall take the liberty that has been allowed us, and
<PB N="90" REF="019561_0087_0FABFC0DC245DD08">tran&s;cribe it from a little manu&s;cript account, with which we have been favoured by a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gentleman is at pre&s;ent re&s;ident in England.

An officer of a Guinea &s;hip, who had the care of a number of new &s;laves, and was returning from the <HI>&s;ale-yard</HI> to the ve&s;&s;el with &s;uch as remained un&s;old, ob&s;erved a &s;tout fellow among them rather &s;low in his motions, which he therefore quickened with his rattan. The &s;lave &s;oon afterwards fell down, and was rai&s;ed by the &s;ame application. Moving forwards a few yards, he fell down again; and this being taken as a proof of his &s;ullen perver&s;e &s;pirit, the enraged officer furiou&s;ly repeated his blows till he expired at his feet. The brute coolly ordered &s;ome of the &s;urviving &s;laves to carry the dead body to the water's &s;ide, where with|out any ceremony or delay, being thrown into the &s;ea, the tragedy was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been immediately fini&s;hed by the not more inhuman &s;harks, with which the harbour then abounded. The&s;e voracious fi&s;h were &s;uppo&s;ed to have followed the ve&s;&s;els from the coa&s;t of Africa, in which ten thou&s;and &s;laves were imported in that one &s;ea&s;on, being allured by the &s;tench, and daily fed by the dead carca&s;&s;es thrown overboard on the voyage.</Q></P>

If the reader &s;hould ob&s;erve here, that cattle are bet|ter protected in this country, than &s;laves in the colonies, his ob&s;ervation will be ju&s;t. The bea&s;t which is driven to market, is defended by law from the goad of the dri|ver; whereas the wretched African, though an human being, and who&s;e feelings receive of cour&s;e a double poignancy from the power of reflection, is unnoticed in this re&s;pect in the colonial code, and may be goaded and and beaten till he expires.</P>
<P>We may now take our leave of the <HI>fir&s;t receivers.</HI> Their crime has been already e&s;timated; and to rea&s;on farther upon it, would be unnece&s;&s;ary.

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>When the wretched Africans are thus put into the hands of the <HI>&s;econd receivers,</HI> they are conveyed to the plantations, where they are totally con&s;idered as <HI>cattle,</HI> or <HI>bea&s;ts of labour;</HI> their very children, if any &s;hould be born to them in that &s;ituation, being previou&s;ly de&s;tined to the condition of their parents. But here a que&s;tion ari&s;es, which will interrupt the thread of the narration for a little time, viz. how far their de&s;cendants, who compo&s;e the fifth order of &s;laves, are ju&s;tly reduced to &s;ervitude, and upon what principles the <HI>receivers</HI> defend their conduct.</P>
<P>Authors have been at great pains to inquire, why, in the ancient &s;ervitude, the child has uniformly follow|ed the condition of the mother. But we conceive that they would have &s;aved them&s;elves much trouble and have done them&s;elves more credit, if in&s;tead of endeavouring to reconcile the cu&s;tom with <HI>heathen</HI> notions, or their own laboured conjectures, they had &s;hewn its incon&s;i&s;t|ency with rea&s;on and nature, and its repugnancy to com|mon ju&s;tice. Suffice it to &s;ay, that the whole theory of the ancients, with re&s;pect to the de&s;cendants of &s;laves,
<PB N="92" REF="019561_0089_0FABFC0F4D234800">may be reduced to this principle, <Q>that as the parents, by becoming <HI>property,</HI> were wholly con&s;idered as <HI>cat|tle,</HI> their children, like <HI>the progeny of cattle,</HI> inherited their parental lot.</Q></P>
<P>Such al&s;o is the excu&s;e of the tyrannical <HI>receivers</HI> be|fore-mentioned. They allege, that they have purcha&s;ed the parents, that they can fell and di&s;po&s;e of them as they plea&s;e, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s them under the &s;ame laws and limitations as their cattle, and that their children, like the progeny of the&s;e, become their property <HI>by birth.</HI></P>
<P>But the ab&s;urdity of the argument will immediately appear. It depends wholly on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the parents are <HI>brutes.</HI> If they are <HI>brutes,</HI> we &s;hall in&s;tantly cea&s;e to contend: if they are <HI>men,</HI> which we think it not difficult to prove, the argument mu&s;t immediately fall, as we have already &s;hewn that there cannot ju&s;tly be any <HI>property</HI> whatever in the <HI>human &s;pecies.</HI></P>
<P>It has appeared al&s;o, in the &s;econd part of this E&s;&s;ay, that as nature made every man's body and mind <HI>his own,</HI> &s;o no <HI>ju&s;t</HI> per&s;on can be reduced to &s;lavery again&s;t his own <HI>con&s;ent.</HI> Do the unfortunate offspring ever <HI>con|&s;ent</HI> to be &s;laves?&mdash;They are &s;laves from their birth.&mdash; Are they <HI>guilty</HI> of crimes, that they lo&s;e their freedom? &mdash;They are &s;laves when they cannot &s;peak.&mdash;Are their <HI>parents</HI> abandoned? The crimes of the parents cannot ju&s;tly extend to the children.</P>
<P>Thus then mu&s;t the tyrannical <HI>receivers,</HI> who pre&s;ume to &s;entence the children of &s;laves to &s;ervitude, if they mean to di&s;pute upon the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e; either allow them to have been <HI>brutes</HI> from their birth, or to have been guilty of crimes at a time, when they were incapable of offending the very <HI>King of Kings.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>But to return to the narration. When the wretched Africans are conveyed to the plantations, they are con|&s;idered as <HI>bea&s;ts of labour,</HI> and are put to their re&s;pec|tive
<PB N="93" REF="019561_0090_0FABFC10083574A8">work. Having led, in their own country, a life of indolence and ea&s;e, where the earth brings forth &s;pon|taneou&s;ly the comforts of life, and &s;pares frequently the toil and trouble of cultivation, they can hardly be ex|pected to endure the drudgeries of &s;ervitude. Calcula|tions are accordingly made upon their lives. It is con|jectured, that if three in four &s;urvive what is called the <HI>&s;ea&s;oning,</HI> the bargain is highly favourable. This &s;ea&s;on|ing is &s;aid to expire, when the two fir&s;t years of their &s;ervitude are completed: It is the time which an African mu&s;t take to be &s;o accu&s;tomed to the colony, as to be able to endure the common labour of a plantation, and to be put into the <HI>gang.</HI> At the end of this period the calculations become verified,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One third of the whole number imported, is often computed to be lo&s;t in the &s;ea&s;oning, which, in round numbers, will be 27000. The lo&s;s in the &s;ea&s;oning depends, in a great mea&s;ure, on two cir|cum&s;tances, viz. on the number of what are called refu&s;e &s;laves that are imported, and on the quantity of new lands in the colony. In the French windward i&s;lands of Martinico, and Guadaloupe, which are cleared and highly cultivated, and in our old &s;mall i&s;lands, one fourth, including refu&s;e &s;laves, is con&s;idered as a general proporti|on. But in St. Domingo where there is a great deal of new land annually taken into culture, and in other colonics in the &s;ame &s;itua|tion, the general proportion, including refu&s;e &s;laves, is found to be one third. This therefore is a lower e&s;timate than the former, and reduces the number to about 23000. We may ob&s;erve, that this is the common e&s;timate, but we have reduced it to 20000 to make it free from all objection.</NOTE><HI>twenty thou&s;and</HI> of tho&s;e, who are annually imported, dying before the &s;ea&s;oning is over. This is &s;urely an horrid and awful con&s;idera|tion: and thus does it appear, (and let it be remember|ed, that it is the lowe&s;t calculation that has been ever made upon the &s;ubject) that out of every annual &s;upply that is &s;hipped from the coa&s;t of Africa,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Including the number that peri&s;h on the voyage, and in the &s;ea|&s;oning. It is generally thought that not half the number purcha&s;ed can be con&s;idered as an additional &s;tock, and of cour&s;e that 50,000 are con&s;umed within the fir&s;t two years from their embarkation.</NOTE><HI>forty thou&s;and lives</HI> are regularly expended, even before it can be &s;aid, that there is really any additional &s;tock for the co|lonies.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="019561_0091_0FABFC10B05F3978">
When the &s;ea&s;oning is over, and the &s;urvivors are thus enabled to endure the u&s;ual ta&s;k of &s;laves, they are con&s;idered as real and &s;ub&s;tantial &s;upplies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That part of the account, that has been hitherto given, ex|tends to all the Europeans and their coloni&s;ts, who are concerned in this horrid practice. But we are &s;orry that we mu&s;t now make a di&s;tinction, and con&s;ine the remaining part of it to the coloni&s;ts of the Briti&s;h We&s;t India i&s;lands, and to tho&s;e of the &s;outhern pro|vinces of North America. As the employment of &s;laves is differ|ent in the two parts of the world la&s;t mentioned, we &s;hall content our&s;elves with de&s;eribing it, as it exi&s;ts in one of them, and we &s;hall afterwards annex &s;uch treatment and &s;uch con&s;equences as are applicable to both. We have only to add, that the reader mu&s;t not con&s;ider our accounts as <HI>univer&s;ally,</HI> but only <HI>generally,</HI> true.</NOTE> From this period therefore we &s;hall de&s;cribe their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>They are &s;ummoned at five in the morning to begin their work. This work may be divided into two kinds, the culture of the fields, and the collection of gra&s;s for cattle. The la&s;t is the mo&s;t laborious and in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">erable employment; as the gra&s;s can only be collected blade by blade, and is to be fetched frequently twice a day at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the plantation. In the&s;e two occupations they are jointly taken up, with no other intermi&s;&s;ion than that of taking their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence twice, till nine at night. They then &s;eparate for their re&s;pec|tive huts, when they gather &s;ticks, prepare their &s;upper, and attend their families. This employs them till mid|night, when they go to re&s;t. Such is their daily way of life for rather more than half the year. They are <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> hours, including two intervals at meals, in the &s;ervice of their ma&s;ters: they are employed <HI>three</HI> afterwards in their own nece&s;&s;ary concerns; <HI>five</HI> only remain for &s;leep, and their day is fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>During the remaining portion of the year, or the time of crop, the nature, as well as the time of their employment, is con&s;iderably changed. The whole gang is generally divided into two or three bodies. One of the&s;e, be&s;ides the ordinary labour of the day, is kept in turn at the mills, that are con&s;tantly going, during the whole of the night. This is a dreadful encroach|ment

Tho&s;e who can keep their eyes open during their nightly labour, and are willing to re&s;i&s;t the drow&s;ine&s;s that is continually coming upon them, are pre&s;ently worn out; while &s;ome of tho&s;e, who are overcome, and who feed the mill be|tween a&s;leep and awake, &s;uffer, for thus obeying the calls of nature, by the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">An hand or arm being frequently ground off.</NOTE> lo&s;s of a limb. In this man|ner they go on, with little or no re&s;pite from their work, till the crop &s;ea&s;on is over, when the year (from the time of our fir&s;t de&s;cription) is completed.</P>
<P><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The reader will &s;carcely believe it, but it is a fact, that a &s;lave's annual allowance from his ma&s;ter, for provi&s;ions, clothing, medi|cines when &s;ick, &amp;c. is limited, upon an average, to thirty &s;hill|ings.</NOTE> To &s;upport a life of &s;uch unparalleled drudgery, we &s;hould at lea&s;t expect to find, that they were comforta|bly clothed, and plentifully fed. But &s;ad rever&s;e! they have &s;carcely a covering to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the inclemency of the night. Their provi&s;ions are frequent|ly bad, and are always dealt out to them with &s;uch a &s;paring hand, that the means of a bare livelihood are not placed within the reach of four out of five of the&s;e unhappy people. It is a fact, that many of the di&s;orders of &s;laves are contracted from eating the vegetables, which their little &s;pots produce, before they are &s;uffici|ently ripe: a clear indication, that the calls of hunger are frequently &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, as not to &s;uffer them to wait, till they can really enjoy them.</P>
<P>This &s;ituation, of a want of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, added to that of hard and continual labour, mu&s;t be &s;ufficiently painful of it&s;elf. How then mu&s;t
<PB N="96" REF="019561_0093_0FABFC12FAFC3458">the pain be &s;harpened, if it be accompanied with &s;eve|rity! if an unfortunate &s;lave does not come into the field exactly at the appointed time, if, drooping with &s;ick|ne&s;s or fatigue, he appears to work unwillingly, or if the bundle of gra&s;s that he has been collecting, appears too &s;mall in the eye of the over&s;eer, he is equally &s;ure of experiencing the whip. This in&s;trument era&s;es the &s;kin, and cuts out &s;mall portions of the fle&s;h at almo&s;t every &s;troke; and is &s;o frequently applied, that the &s;mack of it is all day long in the ears of tho&s;e, who are in the vicinity of the plantations. This &s;everity of ma&s;ters, or managers, to their &s;laves, which is con&s;ider|ed only as common di&s;cipline, is attended with bad ef|fects. It enables them to behold in&s;tances of cruelty without commi&s;eration, and to be guilty of them with|out remor&s;e. Hence tho&s;e many acts of deliberate mu|tilation, that have taken place on the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ions: hence tho&s;e many acts of inferiour, though &s;hocking, bar|barity, that have taken place without any occa&s;ion at all:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>A boy having received &s;ix &s;laves as a pre&s;ent from his father, immediately &s;lit their ears, and for the following rea&s;on, that as his father was a whim&s;ical man, he might claim them again, un|le&s;s they were marked.</Q> We do not mention this in&s;tance as a con&s;irmation of the pa&s;&s;age to which it is annexed, but only to &s;hew how cautious we ought to be in giving credit to what may be ad|vanced in any work written in defence of &s;lavery, by any native of the colonies: for being trained up to &s;cenes of cruelty from his cradle, he may, con&s;i&s;tently with his own feelings, repre&s;ent that treatment as mild, at which we, who have never been u&s;ed to &s;ee them, &s;hould ab&s;olutely &s;hudder.</NOTE> the very &s;litting of ears has been con&s;idered as an operation, &s;o perfectly devoid of pain, as to have been performed for no other rea&s;on than that for which a brand is &s;et upon cattle, as <HI>a mark of property.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not the only effect, which this &s;everity pro|duces: for while it hardens their hearts, and makes them in&s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;ery of their fellow-creatures, it be|gets a turn for wanton cruelty. As a proof of this, we &s;hall mention one, among the many in&s;tances that occur, where ingenuity has been exerted in contriving modes of
<PB N="97" REF="019561_0094_0FABFC1BEC0AA0B0">torture. <Q>An iron coffin, with holes in it, was kept by a certain coloni&s;t, as an auxiliary to the la&s;h. In this the poor victim of the ma&s;ter's re&s;entment was in|clo&s;ed, and placed &s;ufficiently near a fire, to occa&s;ion extreme pain, and con&s;equently &s;hrieks and groans, until the revenge of the ma&s;ter was &s;atiated, without any other inconvenience on his part, then a tempora|ry &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the &s;lave's labour. Had he been flog|ged to death, or his limbs mutilated, the intere&s;t of the brutal tyrant would have &s;uffered a more irrepara|ble le&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In mentioning this in&s;tance, we do not mean to in|&s;inuate, that it is common. We know that it was re|probated by many. All that we would infer from it is, that where men are habituated to a &s;y&s;tem of &s;e|verity, they become <HI>wantonly cruel,</HI> and that the mere toleration of &s;uch an in&s;trument of torture, in any country, is a clear indication, <HI>that this wretched cla&s;s of men do not there enjoy the protection of any laws, that may be pretended to have been enacted in their favour.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Such then is the general &s;ituation of the unfortunate Africans. They are beaten and tortured at di&s;cretion. They are badly clothed. They are mi&s;erably fed. Their drudgery is inten&s;e and ince&s;&s;ant, and their re&s;t &s;hort. For &s;carcely are their heads reclined, &s;carcely have their bodies a re&s;pite from the labour of the day, or the cruel hand of the over&s;eer, but they are &s;ummoned to renew their &s;orrows. In this manner they go on from year to year, in a &s;tate of the lowe&s;t degradation, without a &s;ingle law to protect them, without the po&s;&s;ibility of redre&s;s, without a hope that their &s;ituation will be changed, un|le&s;s death &s;hould terminate the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Having de&s;cribed the general &s;ituation of the&s;e un|fortunate people, we &s;hah now take notice of the com|mon con&s;equences that are found to attend it, and relate them &s;eparately, as they re&s;ult either from long and pain|ful <HI>labour,</HI> a <HI>want</HI> of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, or continual <HI>&s;everity</HI></P>
<P>Oppre&s;&s;ed by a daily ta&s;k of &s;uch immoderate labour as human nature is utterly unable to perform, many of
<PB N="98" REF="019561_0095_0FABFC214522E160">them run away from their ma&s;ters. They fly to the re|ce&s;&s;es of the mountains, where they choo&s;e rather to live upon any thing that the &s;oil affords them, nay, the very &s;oil it&s;elf, than return to that <HI>happy &s;ituation,</HI> which is repre&s;ented by the <HI>receivers,</HI> as the condition of a &s;lave.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens, that the manager of a moun|tain plantation, falls in with one of the&s;e; he immedi|ately &s;eizes him, and threatens to carry him to his for|mer ma&s;ter, unle&s;s he will con&s;ent to live on the moun|tain and cultivate his ground. When his plantation is put in order, he carries the delinquent home, abandons him to all the &s;ugge&s;tions of de&s;potick rage, and accepts a reward for his <HI>hone&s;ty.</HI> The unhappy wretch is chain|ed, &s;courged, tortured; and all this, becau&s;e he obeyed the dictates of nature, and wanted to be free. And who is there, that would not have done the &s;ame thing, in the &s;ame &s;ituation? Who is there, that has once known the charms of liberty, that would not fly from de&s;poti&s;m?

<P>But this law is even mild, when compared with another again&s;t the &s;ame offence, which was in force &s;ometime ago, and which we fear is even nom in force, in &s;ome of tho&s;e colonies which this account of the treament comprehends. <Q>Adverti&s;ements have frequently ap|peared there, offering a reward for the apprehending of fugitive &s;laves either alive or <HI>dead.</HI> The following in&s;tance was given us by a per&s;on of unque&s;tionable veracity, under who&s;e own ob&s;ervation it fell. As he was travelling in one of the colonies alluded to, he
<PB N="99" REF="019561_0096_0FABFC23681EB8B0">ob&s;erved &s;ome people in pur&s;uit of a poor wretch, who was &s;eeking in the wilderne&s;s an a&s;ylum from his labours. He heared the di&s;charge of a gun, and &s;oon afterwards &s;topping at an hou&s;e for refre&s;hment, the head of the fugitive, &s;till reeking with blood, was brought in and laid upon a table with exultation. The production of &s;uch a trophy was the proof <HI>required by law</HI> to entitle the heroes to their reward.</Q> Now reader determine if you can, who were the mo&s;t ex|ecrable; the rulers of the &s;tate in authorizing murder, or the people in being bribed to commit it.</P>
<P>This is one of the common con&s;equences of that im|moderate &s;hare of labour, which is impo&s;ed upon them; nor is that, which is the re&s;ult of a &s;canty allowance of food, le&s;s to be lamented. The wretched African is often &s;o deeply pierced by the excruciating &s;angs of hun|ger, as almo&s;t to be driven to de&s;pair. What is he to do in &s;uch a trying &s;ituation? Let him apply to the <HI>receivers.</HI> Alas! the maje&s;ty of <HI>receiver&s;hip</HI> is too &s;acred for the ap|peal, and the intru&s;ion would be fatal. Thus attacked on the one hand, and &s;hut out from every po&s;&s;ibility of relief on the other, he has only the choice of being &s;tarved, or of relieving his nece&s;&s;ities by taking a &s;mall portion of the fruits of his own labour. Horrid crime! to be found eating the cane, which probably his own hands have planted, and to be eating it, becau&s;e his nece&s;&s;ities were pre&s;&s;ing! This crime however is of &s;uch a magni|tude, as always to be accompanied with the whip; and &s;o unmercifully has it been applied on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, as to have been the cau&s;e, in wet weather, of the delin|quent's death. But the &s;mart of the whip has not been the only pain that the wretched Africans have experi|enced. Any thing that pa&s;&s;ion could &s;eize, and convert into an in&s;trument of puni&s;hment, has been u&s;ed; and, horrid to relate! the very knife has not been overlooked in the fit of phrenzy. Ears have been &s;lit, eyes have been beaten out, and bones have been broken; and &s;o frequently has this been the ca&s;e, that it has been a mat|ter of con&s;tant lamentation with di&s;intere&s;ted people,
<PB N="100" REF="019561_0097_0FAC02CF3190A4F8">who out of curio&s;ity have attended the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly in Jamaica. The&s;e ob&s;ervations were made by di&s;|intere&s;ted people, who were there for three or four years during the late war.</NOTE> markets to which the&s;e unhappy people weekly re&s;ort, that they have not been able to turn their eyes on any group of them whatever, but they have beheld the&s;e inhuman marks of pa&s;&s;ion, de&s;poti&s;m, and caprice.</P>
<P>But the&s;e in&s;tances of barbarity have not been able to deter them from &s;imilar proceedings. And indeed, how can it be expected that they &s;hould? They have &s;till the &s;ame appetite to be &s;atisfied as before, and to drive them to de&s;peration. They creep out clande&s;tinely by night, and go in &s;earch of food into their ma&s;ter's, or &s;ome neighbouring plantation. But here they are almo&s;t equally &s;ure of &s;uffering. The watchman, who will be puni&s;hed him&s;elf, if he neglects his duty, frequently &s;eizes them in the fact. No excu&s;e or intreaty will avail; he mu&s;t puni&s;h them for an example, and he mu&s;t puni&s;h them, not with a &s;tick, nor with a whip, but with a cutla&s;s. Thus it happens, that the&s;e unhappy &s;laves, if they are taken, are either &s;ent away mangled in a barba|rous manner, or are killed upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>We may now mention the con&s;equences of the &s;everi|ty. The wretched Africans, daily &s;ubjected to the la&s;h, and unmercifully whipt and beaten on every trifling oc|ca&s;ion, have been found to re&s;i&s;t their oppo&s;ers. Un|pardonable crime! that they &s;hould have the feelings of nature! that their brea&s;ts &s;hould glow with re&s;entment on an injury! that they &s;hould be &s;o far overcome, as to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e, whom <HI>they are under no obligation to obey,</HI> and who&s;e only title to their &s;ervices con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>a violation of the rights of men!</HI> What has been the con&s;equences? But here let us &s;pare the feelings of the reader, (we wi&s;h we could &s;pare our own) and let us only &s;ay, without a recital of the cruelty, <HI>that they have been murdered at the di&s;cretion of their ma&s;ters.</HI> For let the reader ob&s;erve, that the life of an African is only valued at a price, that would

<P>Immortal Alfred! father of our invaluable con&s;tituti|on! parent of the civil ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy! how ought thy laws to excite our love and veneration, who ha&s;t for|bidden us, thy po&s;terity, to tremble at the frown of ty|rants! how ought they to perpetuate thy name, as ve|nerable, to the remote&s;t ages, who has &s;ecured, even to the meane&s;t &s;ervant, a fair and impartial trial!

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>Some people may &s;uppo&s;e, from the melancholy ac|count that has been given in the preceding chapter, that we have been ab&s;olutely dealing in romance: that the &s;cene exhibited is rather a dreary picture of the imagina|tion, than a repre&s;entation of fact. Would to heaven, for the honour of human nature, that this were really the ca&s;e! We wi&s;h we could &s;ay, that we have no te&s;ti|mony to produce for any of our a&s;&s;ertions, and that our
<PB N="102" REF="019561_0099_0FAC02D0CFA975E0">de&s;cription of the general treatment of &s;laves has been greatly exaggerated.</P>
<P>But the <HI>receivers,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the ample and di&s;|intere&s;ted evidence, that can be brought on the occa&s;ion, do not admit the de&s;cription to be true. They &s;ay fir&s;t, <Q>that if the &s;lavery were &s;uch as has been now repre|&s;ented, no human being could po&s;&s;ibly &s;upport it long.</Q> Melancholy truth! the wretched Africans ge|nerally peri&s;h in their prime. Let them reflect upon the prodigious &s;upplies that are <HI>annually</HI> required, and their argument will be nothing le&s;s than a confe&s;&s;ion, that the &s;lavery has been ju&s;tly depicted.</P>
<P>They appeal next to every man's own rea&s;on, and de&s;ire him to think &s;eriou&s;ly, whether <Q>&s;elf-intere&s;t will not always re&s;train the ma&s;ter from acts of cruel|ty to the &s;lave, and whether &s;uch accounts therefore, as the foregoing, do not contain within them&s;elves, their own refutation.</Q> We an&s;wer, "No." For if this re&s;training principle be as powerful as it is imagin|ed, why does not the general conduct of men afford us a better picture? What is imprudence, or what is vice, but a departure from every man's own intere&s;t, and yet the&s;e are the characteri&s;ticks of more than half the world?&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;But, to come more clo&s;ely to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, <HI>&s;elf-intere&s;t</HI> will be found but a weak barrier again&s;t the &s;allies of <HI>pa&s;&s;ion:</HI> particularly where it has been daily indulged in its greate&s;t latitude, and there are no laws to re&s;train its calamitous effects. If the ob&s;ervation be true, that pa&s;&s;ion is a &s;hort madne&s;s, then it is evident that &s;elf-intere&s;t, and every other con&s;ideration, mu&s;t be lo&s;t, &s;o long as it continues. We cannot have a &s;tronger in&s;tance of this, than in a circum&s;tance related in the &s;econd part of this E&s;&s;ay, "that though the Africans have gone to war for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of procuring &s;laves, yet &s;o great has been their re&s;entment at the re&s;i&s;tance they have frequently found, that their <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI> has entirely got the better of their <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> and they have murdered all without any di&s;crimination, either of age or &s;ex." Such may be pre&s;umed to be the ca&s;e with the no le&s;s
<PB N="103" REF="019561_0100_0FAC02D49DBB34C0">&s;avage <HI>receivers.</HI> Impre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t haughty and tyrannical notions, ea&s;ily provoked, accu&s;tomed to in|dulge their anger, and, above all, habituated to &s;cenes of cruelty, and unawed by the fear of laws, they will hardly be found to be exempt from the common fail|ings of human nature, and to &s;pace an unlucky &s;lave, at a time when men of a cooler temper, and better regulated pa&s;&s;ions, are &s;o frequently blind to their own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But if <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI> may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be generally more than a balance for <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> how mu&s;t the &s;cale be turn|ed in favour of the melancholy picture exhibited, when we reflect that <HI>&s;elf-pre&s;ervation</HI> additionally &s;teps in, and demands the mo&s;t <HI>rigorous &s;everity.</HI> For when we con|&s;ider that where there is <HI>one</HI> ma&s;ter, there are <HI>fifty</HI> &s;laves; that the latter have been all forcibly torn from their country, and are retained in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation by violence; that they are perpetually at war in their hearts with their oppre&s;&s;ors, and are continually cheri&s;hing the &s;eeds of revenge; it is evident that even <HI>avarice</HI> her&s;elf, however cool and deliberate, however free from pa&s;|&s;ion and caprice, mu&s;t &s;acrifice her own &s;ordid feelings, and adopt a &s;y&s;tem of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, which it mu&s;t be ruinous to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Thus then, if no picture had been drawn of the &s;itua|tion of &s;laves, and it had been le&s;t &s;olely to every man's &s;ober judgment to determine, what it might probably be, he would conclude, that if the &s;ituation were ju&s;t|ly de&s;cribed, the page mu&s;t be frequently &s;tained with acts of uncommon cruelty.</P>
<P>It remains only to make a reply to an objection, that is u&s;ually advanced again&s;t particular in&s;tances of cruel|ty to &s;laves, as recorded by various writers. It is &s;aid that <Q>&s;ome of the&s;e are &s;o inconceivably, and beyond all example inhuman, that their very exce&s;s above the common mea&s;ure of cruelty &s;hews them at once ex|aggerated and incredible.</Q> But their credibility &s;hall be e&s;timated by a &s;uppo&s;ition. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that the following in&s;tance had been recorded by a writer of the highe&s;t reputation, <Q>that the ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, bound
<PB N="104" REF="019561_0101_0FAC02D71CA94F90">"to the we&s;tern colonies with &s;laves, on a pre&s;umption "that many of them would die, &s;elected an <HI>hundred "and thirty two</HI> of the mo&s;t &s;ickly, and ordered them "to be thrown into the &s;ea, to recover their value from "the in&s;urers, and, above all, that the fatal order was put into execution.</Q> What would the reader have thought on the occa&s;ion? Would be have believed the fact? It would have &s;urely &s;taggered his faith; becau&s;e he could never have heard that any <HI>one</HI> man ever was, and could never have &s;uppo&s;ed that any <HI>one</HI> man ever could be, guilty of the murder of <HI>&s;uch a number</HI> of his fellow creatures. But when he is informed that &s;uch a fact as this came before<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The action was brought by the owners again&s;t the under-wri|ters, to recover the value of the <HI>murdered</HI> &s;laves.

The great God, who looks down upon all his creatures with the &s;ame impartial eye, &s;eems to have infatuated the parties concerned, that they might bring the horrid circum&s;tance to light, that it might be recorded in the annals of a publick court, as an authen|tick &s;pecimen of the treatment which the unfortunate Africans undergo, and at the &s;ame time, as an argu|ment to &s;hew, that there is no &s;pecies of cruelty, that is recorded to have been exerci&s;ed upon the&s;e wretched people, &s;o enormous that it may not <HI>readily be believed.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>If the treatment then, as before de&s;cribed, is con|firmed by rea&s;on, and the great credit that is due to di&s;intere&s;ted writers on the &s;ubject; if the unfortunate Africans are u&s;ed, as if their fle&s;h were &s;tone, and their vitals bra&s;s; by what arguments do you <HI>receivers</HI> defend your conduct?</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="019561_0102_0FAC02D803A84B68">
You &s;ay that a great part of your &s;avage treatment con&s;i&s;ts in puni&s;hment for real offences, and frequently for &s;uch offences, as all civilized nations have concurred in puni&s;hing. The fir&s;t charge that you exhibit again&s;t them is &s;pecifick, it is that of <HI>theft.</HI> But how much rather ought you <HI>receivers</HI> to blu&s;h, who reduce them to &s;uch a &s;ituation! who reduce them to the dreadful alternative, that they mu&s;t either <HI>&s;teal</HI> or <HI>peri&s;h!</HI> How much rather ought you <HI>receivers</HI> to be con&s;idered as <HI>rob|bers</HI> your&s;elves, who cau&s;e the&s;e unfortunate people to be <HI>&s;tolen!</HI> And how much greater is your crime, who are <HI>robbers of human liberty!</HI></P>
<P>The next charge which you exhibit again&s;t them, is general, it is that of <HI>rebellion;</HI> a crime of &s;uch a lati|tude, that you can impo&s;e it upon almo&s;t every action, and of &s;uch a nature, that you always annex to it the mo&s;t excruciating pain. But what a contradiction is this to common &s;en&s;e! Have the wretched Africans formally re&s;igned their freedom? Have you any other claim upon their obedience, than that of force? If then they are your &s;ubjects, you violate the laws of government, by making them unhappy. But if they are not your &s;ub|jects, then, even though they &s;hould re&s;i&s;t your proceed|ings, they are not <HI>rebellious.</HI></P>
<P>But what do you &s;ay to that long catalogue of of|fences, which you puni&s;h, and of which no people but your&s;elves take cognizance at all? You &s;ay that the wi&s;|dom of legi&s;lation has in&s;erted it in the colonial laws, and that you puni&s;h by authority. But do you allude to that execrable code, that <HI>authori&s;es murder?</HI> that tempts an unoffended per&s;on to kill the &s;lave, that ab|hors and flies your &s;ervice? that delegates a power, which no ho&s;t of men, which not all the world, can po&s;&s;e&s;s?&mdash;</P>
<P>Or,&mdash;What do you &s;ay to that daily unmerited &s;eve|rity, which you con&s;ider only as common di&s;cipline? Here you &s;ay that the Africans are vicious, that they are all of them ill-di&s;po&s;ed, that you mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;evere. But can they be well-di&s;po&s;ed to their oppre&s;&s;|ors? In their own country they were ju&s;t, generous,
<PB N="106" REF="019561_0103_0FAC02D9D8889420">ho&s;pitable: qualities, which all the African hi&s;torians al|low them eminently to po&s;&s;e&s;s. If then they are vicious, they mu&s;t have contracted many of their vices from your|&s;elves; and as to their own native vices, if any have been imported with them, are they not amiable, when compared with yours?</P>
<P>Thus then do the excu&s;es, which have been hitherto made by the <HI>receivers,</HI> force a relation of &s;uch circum|&s;tances, as makes their conduct totally inexcu&s;able, and, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing at all, highly aggravates their guilt.</P>

<P>We come now to that other &s;y&s;tem of rea&s;oning, which is always applied, when the former is confuted; <Q>that the Africans are an inferiour link of the chain of nature, and are made for &s;lavery.</Q></P>
<P>This a&s;&s;ertion is proved by two arguments; the fir&s;t of which was advanced al&s;o by the ancients, and is drawn from the <HI>inferiority of their capacities.</HI></P>
<P>Let us allow then for a moment, that they appear to have no parts, that they appear to be void of under|&s;tanding.

Is this wonderful when by ince&s;&s;ant labour, the continual application of the la&s;h, and the mo&s;t inhuman treatment that imagination can devi&s;e, you overwhelm their genius, and hinder it from breaking forth?&mdash;No,&mdash;You confound their abilities by the &s;everity of their &s;ervitude: for as a &s;park of fire, if cru&s;hed by too great a weight of incumbent fuel, cannot be blown into a flame, but &s;uddenly expires, &s;o the hu|man mind, if depre&s;&s;ed by rigorous &s;ervitude, cannot be excited to a di&s;play of tho&s;e &s;aculties, which might otherwi&s;e have &s;hone with the brighte&s;t lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Neither is it wonderful in another point of view. For what is it that awakens the abilities of men, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hes them from the common herd? Is it not often the amiable hope of becoming &s;erviceable to individuals, or the &s;tate? Is it not often the hope of riches, or of pow|er?
<PB N="107" REF="019561_0104_0FAC02DA6AA15480">Is it not frequently the hope of temporary honours, or a la&s;ting fame? The&s;e principles have all a wonderful effect upon the mind. They call upon it to exert its faculties, and bring tho&s;e talents to the publick view, which had otherwi&s;e been concealed. But the unfortu|nate Africans have no &s;uch incitements as the&s;e, that they &s;hould &s;hew their genius. They have no hope of riches, power, honours, fame. They have no hope but this, that their mi&s;eries will be &s;oon terminated by death.</P>
<P>And here we cannot but cen&s;ure and expo&s;e the mur|murings of the unthinking and the gay; who, going on in a continual round of plea&s;ure and pro&s;perity, repine at the will of Providence, as exhibited in the &s;hortne&s;s of human duration. But let a weak and infirm old age overtake them: let them experience calamities: let them feel but half the mi&s;eries which the wretched Africans undergo, and they will prai&s;e the goodne&s;s of Provi|dence, who hath made them mortal; who hath pre&s;crib|ed certain ordinary bounds to the life of man; and who, by &s;uch a limitation, hath given all men this comforta|ble hope, that however per&s;ecuted in life, a time will come, in the common cour&s;e of nature, when their &s;uf|ferings will have an end.</P>
<P>Such then is the nature of this &s;ervitude, that we can hardly expect to find in tho&s;e, who undergo it, even the glimp&s;e of genius. For if their minds are in a continu|al &s;tate of depre&s;&s;on, and if they have no expectations in life to awaken their abilities, and make them eminent, we cannot be &s;urprized if a &s;ullen gloomy &s;tupidity &s;hould be the leading mark in their charrcter; or if they &s;hould appear inferiour to tho&s;e, who do not only enjoy the in|valuable ble&s;&s;ings of freedom, but have every pro&s;pect before their eyes, that can allure them to exert their fa|culties. Now, if to the&s;e con&s;iderations we add, that the wretched Africans are torn from their country in a &s;tate of nature, and that in general, as long as their &s;lavery continues, every ob&s;tacle is placed in the way of their improvement, we &s;hall have a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to any argument that may be drawn from the inferiority of their capacities.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="019561_0105_0FAC02DDB126E2C0">
It appears then from the circum&s;tances that have been mentioned, that to form a true judgment of the abilities of the&s;e unfortunate people, we mu&s;t either take a ge|neral view of them before their &s;lavery commences, or confine our attention to &s;uch, as, after it has commenced, have had any opportunity given them of &s;hewing their genius either in arts or letters. If, upon &s;uch a fair and impartial view, there &s;hould be any rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that they are at all inferiour to others in the &s;ame &s;itua|tion, the argument will then gain &s;ome of that weight and importance, which it wants at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In their own country, where we are to &s;ee them fir&s;t, we mu&s;t expect that the pro&s;pect will be unfavourable. They are mo&s;tly in a &s;avage &s;tate. Their powers of mind are limited to few objects. Their ideas are con&s;equently few. It appears, however, that they follow the &s;ame mode of life, and exerci&s;e the &s;ame arts, as the ance&s;|tors of tho&s;e very Europeans, who boa&s;t of their great &s;uperiority, are de&s;cribed to have done in the &s;ame un|cultivated &s;tate. This appears from the Nubian's Geo|graphy, the writings of Leo, the Moor, and all the &s;ub|&s;equent hi&s;tories, which tho&s;e, who have vi&s;ited the Afri|can continent, have written from their own in&s;pection. Hence three conclu&s;ions; that their abilities are &s;ufficient for their &s;ituation;&mdash;that they are as great, as tho&s;e of other people have been, in the &s;ame &s;tage of &s;ociety;&mdash; and that they are as great as tho&s;e of any civilized peo|ple whatever, when the degree of the barbari&s;m of the one is drawn into a compari&s;on with that of the civiliza|tion of the other.</P>
<P>Let us now follow them to the colonies. They are carried over in the unfavourable &s;ituation de&s;cribed. It is ob&s;erved here, that though their abilities cannot be e&s;timated high, from a want of cultivation, they are yet various, and that they vary in proportion as the na|tion, from which they have been brought, has advanced more or le&s;s in the &s;cale of &s;ocial life. This ob&s;ervation, which is &s;o frequently made, is of great importance: for if their abilities expand in proportion to the improve|ment
<PB N="109" REF="019561_0106_0FAC02E0ADEC4578">of their &s;tate, it is a clear indication, that if they were equally improved, they would be equally ingeni|ous.</P>
<P>But here, before we con&s;ider any opportunities that may be a&s;&s;orded them, let it be remembered that even their mo&s;t poli&s;hed &s;ituation may be called barbarous, and that this circum&s;tance, &s;hould they appear le&s;s do|cile than others, may be con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to any objection that may be made to their capacities. Notwith&s;tanding this, when they are put to the mechani|cal arts, they do not di&s;cover a want of ingenuity.&mdash; They attain them in as &s;hort a time as the Europeans, and arrive at a degree of excellence equal to that of their teachers. This is a fact, almo&s;t univer&s;ally known, and affords us this proof, that having learned with facility &s;uch of the mechanical arts, as they have been taught, they are capable of attaining any other, at lea&s;t, of the &s;ame cia&s;s, if they &s;hould receive but the &s;ame in&s;truc|tion</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the liberal arts, their proficiency is certainly le&s;s; but not le&s;s in proportion to their time and opportunity of &s;tudy; not le&s;s, becau&s;e they are le&s;s capable of attaining them, but becau&s;e they have &s;eldom or ever an opportunity of learning them at all. It is yet extraordinary that their talents appear, even in &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ciences, in which they are totally unin&s;tructed. Their abilities in mu&s;ick are &s;uch, as to have been ge|nerally noticed. They play frequently upon a variety of in&s;truments, without any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance than their own ingenuny. They have al&s;o tunes of their own compo&s;i|tion. Some of the&s;e have been imported among us; are now in u&s;e; and are admired for their &s;prightline&s;s and ea&s;e, though the ungenerous and prejudiced impor|ter has concealed their original.</P>
<P>Neither are their talents in poetry le&s;s con&s;picuous. Every occurrence, if their &s;pirits are not too greatly de|pre&s;&s;ed, is turned into a &s;ong. The&s;e &s;ongs are &s;aid to be incoherent and non&s;en&s;ical. But this proceeds prin|cipally from two cau&s;es, an improper conjunction of words, ari&s;ing from an ignorance of the language in
<PB N="110" REF="019561_0107_0FAC02E270B20C98">which they compo&s;e; and a wildne&s;s of thought, ari&s;ing from the different manner, in which the organs of rude and civilized people will be &s;truck by the &s;ame object. And as to their want of harmony and rhyme, which is the la&s;t objection, the difference of pronunciation is the cau&s;e. Upon the whole, as they are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with their own ideas, and are &s;trictly mu&s;ical as pro|nounced by them&s;elves, they afford us as high a proof of their poetical powers, as the works of the mo&s;t ac|knowledged poets.</P>
<P>But where the&s;e impediments have been removed, where they have received an education, and have known and pronounced the language with propriety, the&s;e de|fects have vani&s;hed, and their productions have been le&s;s objectionable. For a proof of this, we appeal to the writings of an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phillis Wheatley, negro &s;lave to Mr. John Wheatley, of Bo|&s;on, in New-England.</NOTE> African girl, who made no contemp|tible appearance in this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition. She was kidnapped when only eight years old, and, in the year 1761, was tran&s;ported to America, where &s;he was &s;old with other &s;laves. She had no &s;chool education there, but receiving &s;ome little in&s;truction from the family, with whom &s;he was &s;o fortunate as to live, &s;he obtained &s;uch a knowledge of the Engli&s;h language within &s;ixteen months from the time of her arrival, as to be able to &s;peak it and read it to the a&s;toni&s;hment of tho&s;e who heard her. She &s;oon afterwards learned to write, and, having a great inclination to learn the Latin tongue, &s;he was indulge, by her ma&s;ter, and made a progre&s;s. Her Poetical works were publi&s;hed with his permi&s;&s;ion, in the year 1773. They contain thirty-eight pieces on different &s;ubjects. We &s;hall beg leave to make a &s;hort extract from two or three of them, for the ob&s;ervation of the reader.</P>

<P>Such is the poetry which we produce as a proof of our a&s;&s;ertions. How far it has &s;ucceeded, the reader may by this time have determined in his own mind.&mdash; We &s;hall therefore only beg leave to accompany it with this ob&s;ervation, that if the authore&s;s <HI>was de&s;igned for &s;lavery,</HI> (as the argument mu&s;t confe&s;s) the greater part of the inhabitants of Britain mu&s;t lo&s;e their claim to freedom.</P>
<P>To this poetry we &s;hall only add, as a farther proof of their abilities, the Pro&s;e compo&s;itions of Ignatius Sancho, who received &s;ome little education. His letters are too well known, to make any extract, or indeed any farther mention of him, nece&s;&s;ary. If other examples of African genius &s;hould be required, &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that they can be produced in abundance; and that if we were allowed to enumerate in&s;tances of African grati|tude, patience, fidelity, honour, as &s;o many in&s;tances of good &s;en&s;e, and a &s;ound under&s;tanding, we fear that thou|&s;ands of the enlightened Europeans would have occa&s;ion to blu&s;h.</P>
<P>But an objection will be made here, that the two per|&s;ons whom we have particularized by name, are prodi|gies, and that if we were to live for many years, we &s;hould &s;carcely meet with two other Africans of the &s;ame de&s;cription. But we reply, that con&s;idering their &s;itua|tion as before de&s;cribed, two per&s;ons, above mediocrity in the literary way, are as many as can be expected with|in a certain period of years; and farther, that if the&s;e
<PB N="113" REF="019561_0110_0FAC02E42E323BA0">are prodigies, they are only &s;uch prodigies as every day would produce, if they had the &s;ame opportunities of acquiring knowledge as other people, and the &s;ame ex|pectations in life to excite their genius. This has been con&s;tantly and &s;olemnly a&s;&s;erted by the pious Benezet,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the Preface.</NOTE> whom we have mentioned before, as having devoted a con&s;iderable part of his time to their in&s;truction. This great man, for we cannot but mention him with vene|ration, had a better opportunity of knowing them than any per&s;on whatever, and he always uniformly declared, that he could never find a difference between their capa|cities and tho&s;e of other people; that they were as ca|pable of rea&s;oning as any individual Europeans; that they were as capable of the highe&s;t intellectual attain|ments; in &s;hort, that their abilities were equal, and that they only wanted to be equally cultivated, to afford &s;pe|cimens of as fine productions.</P>
<P>Thus then does it appear from the te&s;timony of this venerable man, who&s;e authority is &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to &s;ilence all objections again&s;t African capacity, and from the in&s;tances that have been produced, and the ob&s;erva|tions that have been made on the occa&s;ion, that if the minds of the Africans were unbroken by &s;lavery; if they had the &s;ame expectations in life as other people, and the &s;ame opportunities of improvement, they would be equal, in all the various branches of &s;cience, to the Eu|ropeans, and that the argument that &s;tates them <Q>to be an inferiour link of the chain of nature, and de|&s;igned for &s;ervitude,</Q> as far as it depends on the <HI>in|feriority of their capacities,</HI> is wholly malevolent and fal&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As to Mr. Hume's a&s;&s;ertions with re&s;pect to African capacity, we have pa&s;&s;ed them over in &s;ilence, as they have been &s;o admirably refuted by the learned Dr. Beattie, in his E&s;&s;ay on Truth, to which we refer the reader.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;econd argument, by which it is attempted to be proved, <Q>that the Africans are an inferiour link of the chain of nature, and are de&s;igned for &s;lavery,</Q> is drawn from <HI>colour,</HI> and from tho&s;e other marks, which di&s;tingui&s;h them from the inhabitants of Europe.</P>
<P>To prove this with the greater facility, the <HI>receivers</HI> divide in opinion. Some of them contend that the Afri|cans, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, are the de&s;cendants of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is, ch. iv. 15.</NOTE> Cain: others, that they are the po&s;terity of Ham; and that as it was declared by divine in&s;piration, that the&s;e &s;hould be &s;ervants to the re&s;t of the world, &s;o they are de&s;igned for &s;lavery; and that the reducing of them to &s;uch a &s;ituation is only the accompli&s;hment of the will of heaven: while the re&s;t, con&s;idering them from the &s;ame circum&s;tances as a totally di&s;tinct &s;pecies of men, conclude them to be an inferiour link of the chain of nature, and deduce the inference de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer the&s;e arguments in the cleare&s;t and fulle&s;t manner, we are under the nece&s;&s;ity of making two &s;up|po&s;itions, fir&s;t, that the &s;criptures are true; &s;econdly, that they are fal&s;e.</P>
<P>If then the &s;criptures are true, it is evident that the po&s;terity of Cain were extingui&s;hed in the flood. Thus one of the arguments is no more.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the cur&s;e of Ham, it appears al&s;o that it was limited; that it did not extend to the po&s;terity of all his &s;ons, but only to the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is, ch. ix. 25, 26, 27.</NOTE> de&s;cendants of him who was called Canaan: by which it was foretold that the Canaanites, a part of the po&s;terity of Ham, &s;hould &s;erve the po&s;terity of Shem and Japhet. Now how does it appear that the&s;e wretched Africans are the de&s;cendants of Canaan?&mdash;By tho&s;e marks, it will be &s;aid, which di&s;|tingui&s;h them from the re&s;t of the world.&mdash;But where
<PB N="115" REF="019561_0112_0FAC02E5B774CED0">are the&s;e marks to be found in the divine writings?

<P>But unfortunately again for the argument, though wonderfully for the confirmation that the &s;criptures are of divine original, the whole prophecy has been com|pleted. A part of the de&s;cendants of Canaan were hewers of wood and drawers of water, and became tri|butary and &s;ubject to the I&s;raelites, or the de&s;cendants of Shem. The Greeks afterwards, as well as the Ro|mans, who were both the de&s;cendants of Japhet, not only &s;ubdued tho&s;e who were &s;ettled in Syria and Pale|&s;tine, but pur&s;ued and conquered all &s;uch as were then remaining. The&s;e were the Tyrians and Carthaginians:
<PB N="117" REF="019561_0114_0FAC02E7317481D8">the former of whom were ruined by Alexander and the Greeks, the latter by Scipio and the Romans.</P>
<P>It appears then that the &s;econd argument is wholly inapplicable and fal&s;e: that it is fal&s;e in its <HI>application,</HI> becau&s;e tho&s;e, who were the objects of the cur&s;e, were a totally di&s;tinct people: that it is fal&s;e in its <HI>proof,</HI> be|cau&s;e no &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing marks, as have been &s;peci|fied, are to be found in the divine writings: and that, if the proof could be made out, it would be now <HI>inappli|cable,</HI> as the cur&s;e has been long completed.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the third argument, we mu&s;t now &s;up|po&s;e that the &s;criptures are fal&s;e; that mankind did not all &s;pring from the &s;ame original; that there are different &s;pecies of men. Now what mu&s;t we ju&s;tly conclude from &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition? Mu&s;t we conclude that one &s;pe|cies is inferiour to another, and that the inferiority de|pends upon their <HI>colour,</HI> or their <HI>features,</HI> or their <HI>form?</HI> &mdash;No&mdash;We mu&s;t now con&s;ult the analogy of nature, and the conclu&s;ion will be this: "that as &s;he tempered the bodies of the different &s;pecies of men in a different degree, to enable them to endure the re&s;pective climates of their habitation, &s;o &s;he gave them a variety of colour and appearance with a like benevolent de&s;ign."</P>
<P>To &s;um up the whole. If the &s;criptures are true, it is evident that the po&s;terity of <HI>Cain</HI> are no more; that the cur&s;e of <HI>Ham</HI> has been accompli&s;hed; and that, as all men were derived from the &s;ame &s;tock, &s;o this vari|ety of appearance in men mu&s;t either have proceeded from &s;ome interpo&s;ition of the Deity; or from a co-ope|ration of certain cau&s;es, which have an effect upon the human frame, and have the power of changing it more or le&s;s from its primitive appearance, as they happen to be more or le&s;s numerous or powerful than tho&s;e, which acted upon the frame of man in the fir&s;t &s;eat of his ha|bitation. If from the interpo&s;ition of the Deity, then we mu&s;t conclude that he, who bringeth good out of evil, produced it for their convenience. If, from the co-operation of the cau&s;es before related, what argu|ment may not be found again&s;t any &s;ociety of men, who &s;hould happen to differ, in the points alluded to, from our&s;elves?</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="019561_0115_0FAC02E7ECB42B08">
If, on the other hand, the &s;criptures are fal&s;e, then it is evident, that there was neither &s;uch a per&s;on as <HI>Cain,</HI> nor <HI>Ham,</HI> nor <HI>Canaan;</HI> and that nature be&s;towed &s;uch colour, features, and form, upon the different &s;pecies of men, as were be&s;t adapted to their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Thus, on which ever &s;uppo&s;ition it is founded, the whole argument mu&s;t fall. And indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible that it can &s;tand, even in the eye of common &s;en&s;e.&mdash; For if you admit the <HI>form</HI> of men as a ju&s;tification of &s;lavery, you may &s;ubjugate your own brother: if <HI>fea|tures,</HI> then you mu&s;t quarrel with all the world: if <HI>co|lour,</HI> where are you to &s;top? It is evident, that if you travel from the equator to the northern pole, you will find a regular gradation of colour from black to white. Now if you can ju&s;tly take him for your &s;lave, who is of the deepe&s;t die, what hinders you from taking him al&s;o, who only differs from the former but by a &s;hade. Thus you may proceed, taking each in a regular &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion to the poles. But who are you, that thus take into &s;lavery &s;o many people? Where do you live your&s;elf? Do you live in <HI>Spain,</HI> or in <HI>France,</HI> or in <HI>Britain?</HI> If in either of the&s;e countries, take care le&s;t the <HI>whiter natives of the north</HI> &s;hould have a claim upon your&s;elf.&mdash;But the argument is too ridiculous to be farther noticed.</P>
<P>Having now &s;ilenced the whole argument, we might immediately proceed to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of other points, without even declaring our opinion as to which of the &s;uppo&s;itions may be right, on which it has been refuted; but we do not think our&s;elves at liberty to do this. The pre&s;ent age would rejoice to find that the &s;criptures had no foundation, and would anxiou&s;ly catch at the writings of him, who &s;hould mention them in a doubtful man|ner. We &s;hall therefore declare our &s;entiments, by a&s;&s;erting that they are true, and that all mankind, how|ever various their appearance, are derived from the &s;ame &s;tock.</P>
<P>To prove this, we &s;hall not produce tho&s;e innumera|ble arguments, by which the &s;criptures have &s;tood the te&s;t of ages, but advert to a &s;ingle fact. It is an uni|ver&s;al law, ob&s;ervable throughout the whole creation,
<PB N="119" REF="019561_0116_0FAC02E8ADD65830"><HI>that if two animals of a different &s;pecies propagate, their offspring is unable to continue its own &s;pecies.</HI> By this ad|mirable law, the different &s;pecies are pre&s;erved di&s;tinct; every po&s;&s;ibility of confu&s;ion is prevented, and the world is forbidden to be over-run by a race of mon&s;ters. Now, if we apply this law to tho&s;e of the human kind, who are &s;aid to be of a di&s;tinct &s;pecies from each other, it immediately fails. The <HI>mulattoe</HI> is as capable of conti|nuing his own &s;pecies as his father; a clear and irrefra|gable proof, that the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When America was fir&s;t di&s;covered, it was thought by &s;ome, that the &s;cripture account of the creation was fal&s;e, and that there were different &s;pecies of men, becau&s;e they could never &s;uppo&s;e that people, in &s;o rude a &s;tate as the Americans, could have tran&s;|ported them&s;elves to that continent from any parts of the known world. This opinion however was refuted by the celebrated Cap|tain Cooke, who &s;hewed that the traject between the continents of A&s;ia and America, was as &s;hort as &s;ome, which people in as rude a &s;tate have been actually known to pa&s;s. This affords an excellent caution again&s;t an ill-judged and ha&s;ty cen&s;ure of the divine writ|ings, becau&s;e every difficulty which may be &s;tarted, cannot be in|&s;tantly cleared up.</NOTE> &s;cripture account of the creation is true, and that <Q>God, who hath made the world, hath made of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The divine writings, which a&s;&s;ert that all men were derived from the <HI>&s;ame &s;tock,</HI> &s;hew al&s;o, in the &s;ame in&s;tance of <HI>Cu&s;h,</HI> p. 115, that &s;ome of them had changed their original complexion.</NOTE> one blood all the nations of men that dwell on all the face of the earth.</Q></P>
<P>But if this be the ca&s;e, it will be &s;aid that mankind were originally of one colour; and it will be a&s;ked at the &s;ame time, what it is probable that the colour was, and how they came to a&s;&s;ume &s;o various an appearance? To each of the&s;e we &s;hall make that reply, which we conceive to be the mo&s;t rational.</P>
<P>As mankind were originally of the &s;ame &s;tock, &s;o it is evident that they were originally of the &s;ame colour. But how &s;hall we attempt to a&s;certain it? Shall we <HI>Eng|li&s;hmen</HI> &s;ay, that it was the &s;ame as that which we now find to be peculiar to our&s;elves?&mdash;No&mdash;This would be a vain and partial con&s;ideration, and would betray our
<PB N="120" REF="019561_0117_0FAC02E972088090">judgment to have ari&s;en from that fal&s;e fondne&s;s, which habituates us to &s;uppo&s;e, that every thing belonging to our&s;elves is the perfecte&s;t and the be&s;t. Add to this, that we &s;hould always be liable to a ju&s;t reproof from every inhabitant of the globe, who&s;e colour was differ|ent from our own; becau&s;e he would ju&s;tly &s;ay, that he had as good a right to imagine that his own was the pri|mitive colour, as that of any other people.</P>
<P>How then &s;hall we attempt to a&s;certain it? Shall we look into the various climates of the earth, &s;ee the co|lour that generally prevails in the inhabitants of each, and apply the rule? This will be certainly free from par|tiality, and will afford us a better pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s: for as every particular di&s;trict has its particular colour, &s;o it is evident that the complexion of Noah and his &s;ons, from whom the re&s;t of the world were de&s;cended, was the &s;ame as that, which is peculiar to the country, which was the feat of their habitation. This, by &s;uch a mode of deci&s;ion, will be found a dark olive; a beauti|ful colour, and a ju&s;t medium between white and black. That this was the primitive colour, is highly probable from the ob&s;ervations that have been made; and, if ad|mitted, will afford a valuable le&s;&s;on to the Europeans, to be cautious how they deride tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite complexion, as there is great rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, <HI>that the pure&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following are the grand colours di&s;cernible in mankind, between which there are many &s;hades;
<LIST>

</LIST></NOTE>
white is as far removed from the primitive colour as the decpe&s;t black.</HI></P>
<P>We come now to the grand que&s;tion, which is, that if mankind were originally of this or any other colour, how came it to pa&s;s, that they &s;hould wear &s;o various an appearance? We reply, as we have had occa&s;ion to &s;ay before, either <HI>by the interpo&s;ition of the Deity;</HI> or <HI>by a co|operation of certain cau&s;es, which have an effect upon the human frame, and have the power of changing it more or
<PB N="121" REF="019561_0118_0FAC02EA2BEB8BA8">le&s;s from its primitive appearance, as they are more or le&s;s numerous or powerful than tho&s;e, which acted upon the frame of man in the fir&s;t &s;eat of his habitation.</HI></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Divine interpo&s;ition, two epochs have been a&s;&s;igned, when this difference of colour has been imagined to have been &s;o produced. The fir&s;t is that, which has been related, when the cur&s;e was pro|nounced on a branch of the po&s;terity of <HI>Ham.</HI> But this argument has been already refuted; for if the particular colour alluded to were a&s;&s;igned at this period, it was a&s;&s;igned to the de&s;cendants of <HI>Canaan,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e of his other brothers, and was therefore <HI>limited</HI> to the former. But the de&s;cendants of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note, p. 115. To this we may add, that the re&s;t of the de&s;cendants of <HI>Ham,</HI> as far as they can be traced, are now al&s;o black, as well as many of the de&s;cendants of <HI>Shem.</HI></NOTE><HI>Cu&s;h,</HI> as we have &s;hewn before, partook of the &s;ame colour; a clear proof, that it was neither a&s;&s;igned to them on this occa|&s;ion, nor at this period.</P>
<P>The &s;econd epoch is that, when mankind were di&s;|per&s;ed on the building of <HI>Babel.</HI> It has been thought, that both <HI>national features and colour</HI> might probably have been given them at this time, becau&s;e the&s;e would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the confu&s;ion of language, by cau&s;ing them to di&s;per&s;e into tribes, and would have united more firmly the individuals of each, after the di&s;per&s;ion had taken place. But this is improbable: fir&s;t, becau&s;e there is great rea&s;on to pre&s;ume that Mo&s;es, who has mentioned the confu&s;ion of language, would have mentioned the&s;e circum&s;tances al&s;o, if they had actually contributed to bring about &s;o &s;ingular an event: &s;econdly, becau&s;e the confu&s;ion of language was &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to have accompli&s;hed this; and we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that the Deity could have done any thing in vain: and thirdly, becau&s;e, if mankind had been di&s;per&s;ed, each tribe in its peculiar hue, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive, that they could have wandered and &s;ettled in &s;uch a manner, as to exhibit that regular gradation of colour from the equator to the poles, &s;o con&s;picuous at the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="019561_0119_0FAC02EAF1C9AAA0">
The&s;e are the only periods, which there has been even the &s;hadow of a probability for a&s;&s;igning; and we may therefore conclude that the preceding ob&s;ervations, to|gether with &s;uch circum&s;tances as will appear in the pre|&s;ent chapter, will amount to a demon&s;tration, that the difference of colour was never cau&s;ed by any interpo&s;i|tion of the Deity, and that it mu&s;t have proceeded there|fore from that <HI>incidental co-operation of cau&s;es,</HI> which has been before related.</P>
<P>What the&s;e cau&s;es are, it is out of the power of human wi&s;dom po&s;itively to a&s;&s;ert: there are facts; however, which, if properly weighed and put together, will throw con&s;iderable light upon the &s;ubject. The&s;e we &s;hall &s;ub|mit to the peru&s;al of the reader, and &s;hall deduce from them &s;uch inferences only, as almo&s;t every per&s;on mu&s;t make in his own mind, on their recital.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t point, that occurs to be a&s;certained, is, "What part of the &s;kin is the &s;eat of colour?" The old anatomi&s;ts u&s;ually divided the &s;kin into two parts, or lamina; the exteriour and thinne&s;t, called by the Greeks <HI>Epidermis,</HI> by the Romans <HI>Cuticula,</HI> and hence by us <HI>Cuticle;</HI> and the interiour, called by the former <HI>Derma,</HI> and by the latter <HI>Cutis,</HI> or <HI>true &s;kin.</HI> Hence they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;uppo&s;ed, that, as the <HI>true &s;kin</HI> was in every re&s;pect the &s;ame in all human &s;ubjects, however various their external hue, &s;o the &s;eat of colour mu&s;t have exi&s;ted in the <HI>Cuticle,</HI> or upper &s;urface.</P>
<P>Malphigi, an eminent Italian phy&s;ician, of the la&s;t century, was the fir&s;t per&s;on who di&s;covered that the &s;kin was divided into three lamina, or parts; the <HI>Cuticle,</HI> the <HI>true &s;kin,</HI> and a certain coagulated &s;ub&s;tance &s;ituated between both, which he di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of <HI>Muco&s;um Corpus;</HI> a title retained by anatomi&s;ts to the pre&s;ent day: which coagulated &s;ub&s;tance adhered &s;o firm|ly to the <HI>Cuticle,</HI> as, in all former anatomical preparations, to have come off with it, and, from this circum&s;tance, to have led the ancient anatomi&s;ts to believe, that there were but two lamina, or divi&s;ible portions in the human &s;kin.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery was &s;ufficient to a&s;certain the point in que&s;tion: for it appeared afterwards that the <HI>Cuticle,</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="019561_0120_0FAC02EBAE3FDBE8">when divided according to this di&s;covery from the other lamina, was &s;emi-tran&s;parent; that the cuticle of the blacke&s;t negroe was of the &s;ame tran&s;parency and colour, as that of the pure&s;t white; and hence, the <HI>true &s;kins</HI> of both being invariably the &s;ame, that the <HI>muco&s;um corpus</HI> was the &s;eat of colour.</P>
<P>This has been farther confirmed by all &s;ub&s;equent anatomical experiments, by which it appears, that, what|ever is the colour of this intermediate coagulated &s;ub|&s;tance, nearly the &s;ame is the apparent colour of the up|per &s;urface of the &s;kin. Neither can it be otherwi&s;e; for the <HI>Cuticle,</HI> from its tran&s;parency, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily tran&s;mit the colour of the &s;ub&s;tance beneath it, in the &s;ame manner, though not in the &s;ame degree, as the <HI>cornea</HI> tran&s;mits the colour of the <HI>iris</HI> of the eye. This tran&s;parency is a matter of ocular demon&s;tration in white people. It is con&s;picuous in every blu&s;h; for no one can imagine, that the cuticle becomes red, as often as this happens: nor is it le&s;s di&s;coverable in the veins, which are &s;o ea&s;y to be di&s;cerned; for no one can &s;up|po&s;e, that the blue &s;treaks, which he con&s;tantly &s;ees in the faire&s;t complexons, are painted, as it were, on the &s;urface of the upper &s;kin. From the&s;e, and a variety of other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;ea&s;es have a great effect upon the <HI>muca&s;um corpus,</HI> but parti|cularly the jaundice, which turns it yellow. Hence, being tran&s;mitted through the cuticle, the yellow appearance of the whole body.&mdash; But this, even as a matter of ocular demon&s;tration, is no confined &s;olely to white people; negroes them&s;elves, while affected with the&s;e or other di&s;orders, changing their black colour for that which the di&s;ea&s;e ha, conveyed to the <HI>mucous</HI> &s;ub&s;tance.</NOTE> ob&s;ervations, no maxim is more true in phy|&s;iology, than that <HI>on the muco&s;um corpus depends the colour of the human body;</HI> or, in other words, that the <HI>muco&s;um corpus</HI> being of a different colour in different inhabitants of the globe, and appearing through the cuticle or upper &s;urface of the &s;kin, gives them that various appearance, which &s;trikes us &s;o forcibly in contemplating the human race.</P>
<P>As this can be incontrovertibly a&s;certained, it is evi|dent,
<PB N="124" REF="019561_0121_0FAC02EC6A110330">that whatever cau&s;es co-operate in producing this different appearance, they produce it by acting upon the <HI>muco&s;um corpus,</HI> which, from the almo&s;t incredible man|ner in which the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cutaneous pores are &s;o exce&s;&s;ively &s;mall, that one grain of &s;and, (according to Dr. Lewenhoeck's culculations) would cover many hundreds of them.</NOTE> cuticle is perforated, is as acce&s;&s;ible as the cuticle it&s;elf.

In|deed nothing is more contrary to experience than this. Climate depends upon a variety of accidents. High mountains, in the neighbourhood of a place, make it cooler, by chilling the air that is carried over them by the winds. Large &s;preading &s;ucculent plants, if among the productions of the &s;oil, have the &s;ame effect: they afford agreeable cooling &s;hades, and a moi&s;t atmo&s;phere from their continual exhalations, by which the ardour of the &s;un is con&s;iderably abated.

To &s;um up the whole&mdash;Suppo&s;e we were to take a common globe; to begin at the equator; to paint every country along the meridian line in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from thence to the poles; and to paint them with the &s;ame colour which prevails in the re&s;pective inhabitants of each, we &s;hould &s;ee the black, with which we had been obliged to begin, in&s;en&s;ibly changing to an olive, and the olive, through as many intermediate colours, to a white: and if, on the other hand, we &s;hould complete any one of the parallels according to the &s;ame plan, we &s;hould &s;ee a difference perhaps in the appearance of &s;ome of the countries through which it ran, though the difference would con&s;i&s;t wholly in &s;hades of the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P>The argument therefore, which is brought again&s;t the hypothe&s;is, is &s;o far from being an objection, that we &s;hall con&s;ider it as one of the fir&s;t arguments in its fa|vour: for if <HI>climate</HI> has really an influence on the <HI>mu|cous &s;ub&s;tance</HI> of the body, it is evident, that we mu&s;t not only expect to &s;ee a gradation of colour in the inha|bitants from the equator to the poles, but al&s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suppo&s;e we were to &s;ee two nations, contiguous to each other, of black and white inhabitants in the &s;ame parallel, even this would be no objection, for many circum&s;tances are to be con&s;idered.

<P>To this argument, we &s;hall add one that is incontro|vertible, which is, that when the <HI>black</HI> inhabitants of <HI>Africa</HI> are tran&s;planted to <HI>colder,</HI> or the <HI>white</HI> inhabitants of <HI>Europe</HI> to <HI>hotter</HI> climates, their children, <HI>born there,</HI>

<P>As a proof of the fir&s;t, we &s;hall give the words of the Abb&eacute; Raynal, in his admired publication.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ju&s;tamond's Abb&eacute; Raynal, v. 5. p. 193.</NOTE> <Q>The children," &s;ays he, "which they, (the <HI>Africans</HI>) pro|create in <HI>America,</HI> are not &s;o black as their parents were.

<P>This circum&s;tance we have had the plea&s;ure of hear|ing confirmed by a variety of per&s;ons, who have been witne&s;&s;es of the fact; but particularly by many<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The author of this E&s;&s;ay made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to inquire of the mo&s;t intelligent of tho&s;e, whom he could meet with in London, as to the authenticity of the fact.

<P>Neither is this variation in the children from the co|lour of their parents improbable. <HI>The children of the blacke&s;t Africans are</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This circum&s;tance, which always happens, &s;hews that they are de&s;cended from the &s;ame parents as our&s;elves; for had they been a di&s;tinct &s;pecies of men, and the blackne&s;s entirely ingrafted in their con&s;titution and frame, there is great rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, that their children would have been born <HI>black.</HI></NOTE><HI>born white.</HI> In this &s;tate they con|tinue for about a month, when they change to a pale yellow.

<PB N="128" REF="019561_0125_0FAC02F031B94F20">the body, this variation in the children from the colour of their parents is an event, which mu&s;t be rea&s;onably expected: for being born white, and not having equally powerful cau&s;es to act upon them in colder, as their pa|rents had in the hotter climates which they left, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that the &s;ame effect cannot po&s;&s;ibly be produced.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o, if the hypothe&s;is be admitted, may be deduced the rea&s;on, why even tho&s;e children, who have been brought from their country at an early age into cold|er regions, have been<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ob&s;ervation was communicated to us by the gentleman in the medical line, to whom we returned our thanks for certain anato|mical facts.</NOTE> ob&s;erved to be of a lighter co|lour than tho&s;e who have remained at home till they ar|rived at a &s;tate of manhood.

<P>We come now to the &s;econd and oppo&s;ite ca&s;e; for a proof of which we &s;hall appeal to the words of Dr. Mit|chell, in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Philo&s;.

<P>To this in&s;tance we &s;hall add one, which is mentioned by a<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e upon the Trade from Great Britain to Africa, by an African merchant.</NOTE> late writer, who de&s;cribing the <HI>African</HI> coa&s;t, and

<P>The&s;e facts, with re&s;pect to the coloni&s;ts of the <HI>Euro|peans,</HI> are of the highe&s;t importance in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, and de&s;erve a &s;erious attention. For when we know to a certainty from whom they are de&s;cended; when we know that they were, at the time of their tran&s;planta|tion, of the &s;ame colour as tho&s;e from whom they &s;eve|rally &s;prung; and when, on the other hand, we are cre|dibly informed, that they have changed it for the native colour of the place which they now inhabit; the evi|dence in &s;upport of the&s;e facts is as great, as if a per&s;on, on the removal of two or three families into another climate, had determined to a&s;certain the circum&s;tance; as if he had gone with them and watched their children; as if he had communicated his ob&s;ervations at his death to a &s;ucce&s;&s;or; as if his &s;ucce&s;&s;or had pro&s;ecuted the plan, and thus an uninterrupted chain of evidence had been kept up from their fir&s;t removal to any determined period of &s;ucceeding time.</P>
<P>But though the&s;e facts &s;eem &s;ufficient of them&s;elves to confirm our opinion, they are not the only facts which can be adduced in its &s;upport. It can be &s;hewn, that the members of the <HI>very &s;ame family,</HI> when divided from each other, and removed into different countries, have not only changed their family complexion, but that they have changed it to <HI>as many different colours</HI> as they have gone into <HI>different regions of the world.</HI> We can|not have, perhaps, a more &s;triking in&s;tance of this, than in the <HI>Jews.</HI> The&s;e people are &s;cattered over the face of the whole earth.

<P>To the&s;e facts we &s;hall add the following ob&s;ervation, that if we can give credit to the ancient hi&s;torians in ge|neral, a change from the darke&s;t black to the pure&s;t white mu&s;t have actually been accompli&s;hed.

<P>As we have now &s;hewn it to be highly probable, from the facts which have been advanced, that climate is the cau&s;e of the difference of colour which prevails in the different inhabitants of the globe, we &s;hall now &s;hew its probability from &s;o &s;imilar an effect produced on the <HI>mu|cous &s;ub&s;tance</HI> before-mentioned by &s;o &s;imilar a cau&s;e, that though the fact does not ab&s;olutely prove our conjecture to be right, yet it will give us a very lively conception of the manner, in which the phaenomenon may be cau&s;|ed.</P>
<P>This probability may be &s;hewn in the ca&s;e of <HI>freckles,</HI> which are to be &s;een in the face of children, but of &s;uch only, as have the thinne&s;t and mo&s;t tran&s;parent &s;kins, and are occa&s;ioned by the rays of the &s;un, &s;triking forc|ibly on the <HI>mucous &s;ub&s;tance</HI> of the face, and drying the accumulating fluid. This accumulating fluid, or per|&s;pirable matter, is at fir&s;t colourle&s;s; but being expo&s;ed to violent heat, or dried, becomes brown. Hence, the <HI>muco&s;um corpus</HI> being tinged in various parts by this brown coagulated fluid, and the parts &s;o tinged appear|ing through the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ticle,</HI> or upper &s;urface of the &s;kin, ari&s;es that &s;potted appearance, ob&s;ervable in the ca&s;e re|cited.</P>
<P>Now, if we were to conceive a black &s;kin to be an <HI>univer&s;al freckle,</HI> or the rays of the &s;un to act &s;o uni|ver&s;ally on the <HI>mucous &s;ub&s;tance</HI> of a per&s;on's face, as to produce the&s;e &s;pots &s;o contiguous to each other that they &s;hould unite, we &s;hould then &s;ee, in imagination, a face &s;imilar to tho&s;e, which are daily to be &s;een among black people: and if we were to conceive his body to be ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="132" REF="019561_0129_0FAC02F677AB6760">po&s;ed or acted upon in the &s;ame manner, we &s;hould then &s;ee his body a&s;&s;uming a &s;imilar appearance; and thus we &s;hould &s;ee the whole man of a perfect black, or re&s;em|bling one of the naked inhabitants of the torrid zone. Now as the &s;eat of freckles and of blackne&s;s is the &s;ame; as their appearance is &s;imilar; and as the cau&s;e of the fir&s;t is the ardour of the &s;un, it is therefore probable that the cau&s;e of the &s;econd is the &s;ame: hence, if we &s;ub&s;titute for the word <HI>"&s;un,"</HI> what is analogous to it, the word <HI>climate,</HI> the &s;ame effect may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be produced, and the conjecture to receive a &s;anction.</P>
<P>Nor is it unlikely that the hypothe&s;is, which con&s;iders the cau&s;e of freckles and of blackne&s;s as the &s;ame, may be right. For if blackne&s;s is occa&s;ioned by the rays of the &s;un &s;triking forcibly and univer&s;ally on the <HI>mucous &s;ub&s;tance</HI> of the body, and drying the accumulating fluid, we can account for the different degrees of it to be found in the different inhabitants of the globe. For as the quantity of per&s;pirable fluid, and the force of the &s;olar rays is &s;ucce&s;&s;ively increa&s;ed, as the climates are &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively warmer, from any given parallel to the line, it follows that the fluid, with which the <HI>mucous &s;ub&s;tance</HI> will be &s;tained, will be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively thicker and deeper coloured; and hence, as it appears through the cuticle, the complexion &s;ucce&s;&s;ively darker; or, what amounts to the &s;ame thing, there will be a difference of colour in the inhabitants of every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive parallel.</P>
<P>From the&s;e, and the whole of the preceding ob&s;erva|tions on the &s;ubject, we may conclude, that as all the inhabitants of the earth cannot be otherwi&s;e than the children of the &s;ame parents, and as the difference of their appearance mu&s;t have of cour&s;e proceeded from incidental cau&s;es, the&s;e cau&s;es are a combination of tho&s;e qualities, which we call <HI>climate;</HI> that the blackne&s;s of the <HI>Africans</HI> is &s;o far ingra&s;ted in their con&s;titution, in a cour&s;e of many generations, that their children wholly inherit it, if brought up in the &s;ame &s;pot, but that it is not &s;o ab&s;olutely interwoven in their nature, that it can|not be removed, if they are born and &s;ettled in another; that <HI>Noah</HI> and his &s;ons were probably of an <HI>olive</HI> com|plexion;
<PB N="133" REF="019561_0130_0FAC02F84AA48C60">that tho&s;e of their de&s;cendants, who went far|ther to the &s;outh, became of a deeper olive or <HI>copper;</HI> while tho&s;e, who went &s;till farther, became of a deeper copper or <HI>black;</HI> that tho&s;e, on the other hand, who travelled farther to the north, became le&s;s olive or <HI>brown,</HI> while tho&s;e who went &s;till farther than the former, became le&s;s brown or <HI>white;</HI> and that if any man were to point out any one of the colours which prevails in the human complexion, as likely to furni&s;h an argument, that the people of &s;uch a complexion were of a different &s;pecies from the re&s;t, it is probable that his own de&s;cendants, if removed to the climate to which this complexion is peculiar, would, in the cour&s;e of a few generations, de|generate into the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P>Having now replied to the argument, <Q>that the Africans are an inferiour link of the chain of nature,</Q> as far as it depended on their <HI>capacity</HI> and <HI>colour,</HI> we &s;hall now only take notice of an expre&s;&s;ion, which the <HI>receivers</HI> before-mentioned are plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of, <Q>that they are made for &s;lavery.</Q></P>
<P>Had the Africans been <HI>made for &s;lavery,</HI> or to become the property of any &s;ociety of men, it is clear, from the ob&s;ervations that have been made in the &s;econd part of this E&s;&s;ay, that they mu&s;t have been created <HI>devoid of rea&s;on:</HI> but this is contrary to fact. It is clear al&s;o, that there mu&s;t have been many and evident &s;igns of the <HI>in|&s;eriority of their nature,</HI> and that this &s;ociety of men mu&s;t have had a <HI>natural right</HI> to their dominion: but this is equally fal&s;e.

<P>The reader may perhaps think, that the <HI>receivers</HI> have by this time expended all their arguments, but their &s;tore is not &s;o ea&s;ily exhau&s;ted. They are well aware that ju&s;tice, nature, and religion, will continue, as they have ever uniformly done, to oppo&s;e their conduct.&mdash; This has driven them to exert their ingenuity, and has occa&s;ioned that multiplicity of arguments to be found in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments are of a different complexion from the former. They con&s;i&s;t in comparing the &s;tate of <HI>&s;laves</HI> with that of &s;ome of the cla&s;&s;es of <HI>free</HI> men, and in certain &s;cenes of felicity, which the former are &s;aid to enjoy.</P>
<P>It is affirmed that the puni&s;hments which the Africans undergo, are le&s;s &s;evere than the military; that their life is happier than that of the Engli&s;h pea&s;ant; that they have the advantages of manumi&s;&s;ion; that they have
<PB N="135" REF="019561_0132_0FAC02FC0319D2C0">their little &s;pots of ground, their holy-days, their dances; in &s;hort, that their life is a &s;cene of fe&s;tivity and mirth, and that they are much happier in the colonies than in their own country.</P>
<P>The&s;e repre&s;entations, which have been made out with much ingenuity and art, may have had their weight with the unwary; but they will never pa&s;s with men of con&s;ideration and &s;en&s;e, who are accu&s;tomed to e&s;timate the probability of things, before they admit them to be true. Indeed the bare a&s;&s;ertion, that their &s;ituation is even comfortable, contains its own refutation, or at lea&s;t leads us to &s;u&s;pect that the per&s;on, who a&s;&s;erted it, has omitted &s;ome important con&s;iderations in the ac|count. Such we &s;hall &s;hew to have been actually the ca&s;e, and that the repre&s;entations of the <HI>receivers,</HI> when &s;tripped of their glo&s;&s;y ornaments, are but empty de|clamation.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, fir&s;t, of <HI>military puni&s;hments,</HI> that they are more &s;evere than tho&s;e which the <HI>Africans</HI> undergo.&mdash; But this is a bare a&s;&s;ertion without a proof. It is not &s;hewn even by tho&s;e, who a&s;&s;ert it, how the fact can be made out. We are left therefore to draw the compari|&s;on our&s;elves, and to fill up tho&s;e important con&s;iderati|ons, which we have ju&s;t &s;aid that the <HI>receivers</HI> had omit|ted.</P>
<P>That military puni&s;hments are &s;evere we confe&s;s, but we deny that they are &s;everer than tho&s;e with which they are compared. Where is the military man, who&s;e ears have been &s;lit, who&s;e limbs have been mutilated, or who&s;e eyes have been beaten out? But let us even allow, that their puni&s;hments are equal in the degree of their &s;everity: &s;till they mu&s;t lo&s;e by compari&s;on. The &s;oldier is never puni&s;hed but after a fair and equitable trial, and the deci&s;ion of a military court; the unhappy African, at the di&s;certion of his Lord. The one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The articles of war are frequently read at the head of every regiment in the &s;ervice, &s;tating tho&s;e particular actions which are to be con&s;idered as crimes.</NOTE> knows what particular conduct will con&s;titute an offence; the other

<P>Now will any per&s;on affert, on comparing the whole of tho&s;e circum&s;tances together, which relate to their re&s;pective puni&s;hments, that there can be any doubt, which of the two are in the wor&s;t &s;ituation, as to their penal &s;y&s;tems?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the declaration, that the life of an <HI>Afri|can</HI> in the colonies is happier than that of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pea&s;ant, it is equally fal&s;e. Indeed we can &s;carcely with|hold our indignation, when we con&s;ider, how &s;hame|fully the &s;ituation of this latter cla&s;s of men has been mi&s;repre&s;ented, to elevate the former to a &s;tate of ficti|tious happine&s;s. If the repre&s;entations of the <HI>receivers</HI> be true, it is evident that tho&s;e of the mo&s;t approved writers, who have placed a con&s;iderable &s;hare of hap|pine&s;s in the <HI>cottage,</HI> have been mi&s;taken in their opini|on; and that tho&s;e of the rich, who have been heard to &s;igh, and envy the felicity of the <HI>pea&s;ant,</HI> have been treacherous to their own &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>But which are we to believe on the occa&s;ion? Tho&s;e, who endeavour to dre&s;s <HI>vice</HI> in the habit of <HI>virtue,</HI> or tho&s;e, who derive their opinion from their own feelings? The latter are &s;urely to be believed; and we may con|clude therefore, that the horrid picture which is given of the life of the <HI>pea&s;ant,</HI> has not &s;o ju&s;t a foundation as the <HI>receivers</HI> would lead us to &s;uppo&s;e. For has he no plea&s;ure in the thought, that he lives in his <HI>own country,</HI> and among his relations and friends? That he is actually <HI>free,</HI> and that his children will be the &s;ame? That he can never be <HI>&s;old</HI> as a bea&s;t? That he can &s;peak his mind <HI>without the fear of the la&s;h?</HI> That he cannot even be &s;truck <HI>with impunity?</HI> And that he partakes, equally with his &s;uperiours, of the <HI>protection of the law?</HI>&mdash;Now, there is no one of the&s;e advantages which the <HI>African</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and no one, which the de&s;enders of &s;lavery take into their account.</P>

Of the other compari&s;ons that are u&s;ually made, we may ob&s;erve in general, that, as they con&s;i&s;t in compa|ring the iniquitous practice of &s;lavery with other iniquit|ous practices in force among other nations, they can neither rai&s;e it to the appearance of virtue, nor exte|nuate its guilt.

Every &s;ubject, as long as he behaves well, has a right to the protection of government; and the tacit permi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a &s;cene of iniquity, when it becomes known, is as much a breach of duty in government, as the conduct of tho&s;e &s;ubjects, who, on other occa&s;ions, would be termed, and puni&s;hed as, rebellious.</NOTE> governments which &s;uffer them, if not encourage them, to exi&s;t.

<P>With re&s;pect to their <HI>dances,</HI> on which &s;uch a particular &s;tre&s;s has been generally laid, we fear that people may have been as &s;hamefully deceived, as in the former in|&s;tances.

<PB N="140" REF="019561_0137_0FAC0302F79C4460">a more joyful oblivion of their cares. For &s;uppo&s;e any one of the <HI>receivers,</HI> in the middle of a dance, were to addre&s;s his &s;laves in the following manner: <Q><HI>Africans!</HI> I begin at la&s;t to feel for your &s;ituation; and my con|&s;cience is &s;everely hurt, whenever I reflect that I have been reducing tho&s;e to a &s;tate of mi&s;ery and pain, who have never given me offence. You &s;eem to be fond of the&s;e exerci&s;es, but yet you are obliged to take them at &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable hours, that they im|pair your health, which is &s;ufficiently broken by the intolerable &s;hare of labour which I have hitherto im|po&s;ed upon you, I will therefore make you a propo&s;al. Will you be content to live in the colonies, and you &s;hall have the half of every week entirely to your|&s;elves? or will you choo&s;e to return to your mi&s;erable, wretched country?</Q>&mdash;But what is that which &s;trikes their ears? Which makes them motionle&s;s in an in&s;tant? Which interrupts the fe&s;tive &s;cene?&mdash;their country? &mdash;tran&s;porting &s;ound!&mdash;Behold! they are now flying from the dance: you may &s;ee them running to the &s;hore, and, frantick as it were with joy, demanding with open arms an in&s;tantaneous pa&s;&s;age to their beloved na|tive plains.</P>
<P>Such are the <HI>colonial delights,</HI> by the repre&s;entation of which the <HI>receivers</HI> would per&s;uade us, that the <HI>Africans</HI> are taken from their country to a region of conviviality and mirth; and that like tho&s;e, who leave their u&s;ual places of re&s;idence for a &s;ummer's amu&s;ement, they are conveyed to the colonies&mdash;<HI>to bathe,&mdash;to dance,&mdash;to keep holy-day,&mdash;to be jovial.</HI>&mdash;But there is &s;omething &s;o truly ridiculous in the attempt to impo&s;e the&s;e &s;cenes of feli|city on the publick, as &s;cenes which fall to the lot of &s;laves, that the <HI>receivers</HI> mu&s;t have been driven to great extremities, to hazard them to the eye of cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>The la&s;t point that remains to be con&s;idered, is the &s;hameful a&s;&s;ertion, that the <HI>Africans</HI> are much <HI>happier in the colonies, than in their own country.</HI> But in what does this &s;uperiour happine&s;s con&s;i&s;t?

<PB N="141" REF="019561_0138_0FAC0303B1400840">happine&s;s they enjoy.&mdash;But it has been &s;hewn that the&s;e have been unfairly repre&s;ented; and, were they realized in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive latitude, they would not confirm the fact. For if, upon a recapitulation, it con&s;i&s;ts in the plea&s;ure of <HI>manumi&s;&s;ion, they</HI> &s;urely mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed their lives in a much more comfortable manner, who like the <HI>Africans at home,</HI> have had no occa&s;ion for &s;uch a be|nefit at all. But the <HI>receivers,</HI> we pre&s;ume, rea&s;on upon this principle, that we never know the value of a ble&s;|&s;ing but by its lo&s;s. This is generally true: but would any one of them make him&s;elf a <HI>&s;lave</HI> for years, that he might run the chance of the plea&s;ures of <HI>manumi&s;&s;ion?</HI> Or that he might ta&s;te the charms of liberty with <HI>a greater reli&s;h?</HI> Nor is the a&s;&s;ertion le&s;s fal&s;e in every other con&s;ideration. For if their happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the few <HI>holy days,</HI> which <HI>in the colonies</HI> they are permitted to enjoy what mu&s;t be their &s;ituation <HI>in their own country,</HI> where the whole year is but one continued holy-day, or ce&s;&s;ati|on from di&s;cipline and fatigue?&mdash;If in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <HI>of a mean and contracted &s;pot,</HI> what mu&s;t be their &s;ituation, where a whole region is their own, producing almo&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly the comforts of life, and requiring for its cultivation none of tho&s;e hours, which &s;hould be appro|priated to <HI>&s;leep?</HI>&mdash;If in the plea&s;ures of the <HI>colonial dance,</HI> what mu&s;t it be in <HI>their own country,</HI> where they may dance for ever; where there is no &s;tated hour to inter|rupt their felicity, no intolerable labour immediately to &s;ucceed their recreations, and no over&s;eer to receive them under the di&s;cipline of the la&s;h?&mdash;If the&s;e therefore are the only circum&s;tances, by which the a&s;&s;ertion can be proved, we may venture to &s;ay, without fear of oppo|&s;ition, that it can never be proved at all.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are not the only circum&s;tances.

<P>We have now taken a &s;urvey of the treatment which the unfortunate <HI>Africans</HI> undergo, when they are put into the hands of the <HI>receivers.</HI> This treatment, by the four fir&s;t chapters of the pre&s;ent part of this E&s;&s;ay, ap|pears to be wholly in&s;upportable, and to be &s;uch as no human being can apply to another, without the impu|tation of &s;uch crimes, as &s;hould make him tremble.&mdash; But as many arguments are u&s;ually advanced by tho&s;e
<PB N="146" REF="019561_0143_0FAC03089040CFF8">who have any intere&s;t in the practice, by which they would either exculpate the treatment, or dimini&s;h its &s;everity, we allotted the remaining chapters for their di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. In the&s;e we con&s;idered the probability of &s;uch a treatment again&s;t the motives of intere&s;t; the credit that was to be given to tho&s;e di&s;intere&s;ted writers on the &s;ubject, who have recorded particular in&s;tances of barbarity; the inferiority of the <HI>Africans</HI> to the hu|man &s;pecies; the compari&s;ons that are generally made with re&s;pect to their &s;ituation; the po&s;itive &s;cenes of feli|city which they are &s;aid to enjoy, and every other argu|ment, in &s;hort, that we have found to have ever been advanced in the defence of &s;lavery. The&s;e have been all con&s;idered, and we may venture to pronounce, that, in&s;tead of an&s;wering the purpo&s;e for which they were intended, they &s;erve only to bring &s;uch circum&s;tances to light, as clearly &s;hew, that if ingenuity were racked to invent a &s;ituation, that would be the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and in&s;upportable to the human race; it could never in|vent one, that would &s;uit the de&s;cription better, than the&mdash;<HI>colonial &s;lavery.</HI></P>
<P>If this then be the ca&s;e, and if &s;laves, notwith&s;tand|ing all the arguments to the contrary, are exqui&s;itely mi&s;erable, we a&s;k you <HI>receivers, by what right</HI> you re|duce them to &s;o wretched a &s;ituation?</P>
<P>You reply, that you <HI>buy them;</HI> that your <HI>money</HI> con|&s;titutes your <HI>right,</HI> and that, like all other things which you purcha&s;e, they are wholly at your own di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>Upon this principle alone it was, that we profe&s;&s;ed to view your treatment, or examine your right, when we &s;aid, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 49.</NOTE> the que&s;tion re&s;olved it&s;elf into two &s;eparate <Q>parts for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; into the <HI>African</HI> commerce, as explained in the hi&s;tory of &s;lavery, and the &s;ub&s;equent &s;lavery in the colonies, <HI>as founded on the equity of the commerce.</HI></Q> Now, &s;ince it appears that this com|merce, upon the fulle&s;t inve&s;tigation, is contrary to <Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 80</NOTE> <HI>The principles of law and government, the dictates of rea&s;on, the common maxims of equity, the laws of nature,

<P>You your&s;elves al&s;o confe&s;s this. For when we a&s;k you, whether any human being has a right to &s;ell you, you immediately an&s;wer, No; as if nature revolted at the thought, and as if it was &s;o contradictory to your own feelings, as not to require con&s;ideration. But who are you, that have this exclu&s;ive charter of trading in the liberties of mankind? When did nature, or rather the Author of nature, make &s;o partial a di&s;tinction be|tween you and them? When did He &s;ay, that you &s;hould have the privilege of &s;elling others, and that others &s;hould not have the privilege of &s;elling you?</P>
<P>Now &s;ince you confe&s;s, that no per&s;on whatever has a right to di&s;po&s;e of you in this manner, you mu&s;t con|fe&s;s al&s;o, that tho&s;e things are unlawful to be done to you, which are u&s;ually done in con&s;equence of the &s;ale. Let us &s;uppo&s;e then, that in con&s;equence of the <HI>com|merce</HI> you were forced into a &s;hip; that you were con|veyed to another country; that you were &s;old there; that you were confined to ince&s;&s;ant labour; that you were pinched by continual hunger and thir&s;t; and &s;ub|ject to be whipped, cut, and mangled at di&s;cretion, and all this at the hands of tho&s;e, whom you had never of|fended; would you not think that you had a right to re&s;i&s;t their treatment? Would you not re&s;i&s;t it with a &s;afe con&s;cience? And would you not be &s;urprized, if your re&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be termed rebellion?&mdash;By the former premi&s;es you mu&s;t an&s;wer, Yes&mdash;Such then is the ca&s;e with the wretched <HI>Africans.</HI> They have a right to re&s;i&s;t your proceedings. They can re&s;i&s;t them, and yet they cannot ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as rebellious. For though we &s;uppo&s;e them to have been guilty of crimes to one another; though we &s;uppo&s;e them to have been the mo&s;t abandoned and execrable of men, yet are they perfectly innocent with re&s;pect to you <HI>receivers.</HI> You have no

<P>Having now con&s;idered both the <HI>commerce</HI> and <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> it remains only to collect &s;uch arguments as are &s;cattered in different parts of the work, and to make &s;uch addi|tional remarks, as pre&s;ent them&s;elves on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, let us a&s;k you, who have &s;tudied the law of nature, and you, who are learned in the law of the land, if all property mu&s;t not be inferiour in its nature to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, or, in other words, (for it is a ca&s;e, which every per&s;on mu&s;t bring home to his own brea&s;t) if you &s;uppo&s;e that any human being can have <HI>a property in your&s;elves?</HI> Let us a&s;k you apprai&s;ers, who &s;cientifically know the value of things, if any human creature is equi|valent only to any of the trinkets that you wear, or at mo&s;t, to any of the hor&s;es that you ride: or in other words, if you have ever con&s;idered the mo&s;t co&s;tly things that you have valued, as <HI>equivalent to your&s;elves?</HI> Let us a&s;k you rationali&s;ts, if man, as a rea&s;onable being, is not <HI>accountable</HI> for his actions, and let us put the &s;ame que&s;tion to you, who have &s;tudied the divine writings? Let us a&s;k you parents, if ever you thought that you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an <HI>authority</HI> as &s;uch, or if ever you expected a <HI>duty</HI> from your &s;ons; and let us a&s;k you &s;ons, if ever you felt an impul&s;e in your own brea&s;ts to <HI>obey</HI> your pa|rents. Now, if you &s;hould all an&s;wer as we could wi&s;h, if you &s;hould all an&s;wer con&s;i&s;tently with rea&s;on, nature, and the revealed voice of God, what a dreadful argument will pre&s;ent it&s;elf again&s;t the commerce and &s;lavery of the human &s;pecies, when we reflect, that no man whatever
<PB N="149" REF="019561_0146_0FAC030A72778E40">can be bought or reduced to the &s;ituation of a &s;lave, <HI>but he mu&s;t in&s;tantly become a brute, he mu&s;t in&s;tantly be reduced to the value of tho&s;e things, which were made for his own u&s;e and convenience; he mu&s;t in&s;tantly cea&s;e to be accountable for his actions, and his authority as a parent, and his duty as a &s;on, mu&s;t be in&s;tantly no more.</HI></P>
<P>Neither does it e&s;cape our notice, when we are &s;peak|ing of the fatal wound which every &s;ocial duty mu&s;t re|ceive, how con&s;iderably Chri&s;tianity &s;uffers by the con|duct of you <HI>receivers.</HI> For by pro&s;ecuting this impious commerce, you keep the <HI>Africans</HI> in a &s;tate of perpetual ferocity and barbari&s;m; and by pro&s;ecuting it in &s;uch a manner, as mu&s;t repre&s;ent your religion, as a &s;y&s;tem of robbery and oppre&s;&s;ion, you not only oppo&s;e the propa|gation of the go&s;pel, as far as you are able your&s;elves, but throw the mo&s;t certain impediments in the way of others, who might attempt the glorious and important ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Such al&s;o is the effect, which the &s;ub&s;equent &s;lavery in the colonies mu&s;t produce. For by your inhuman treatment of the unfortunate <HI>Africans</HI> there, you create the &s;ame in&s;uperable impediments to a conver&s;ion. For how mu&s;t they dete&s;t the very name of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> when you <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> are deformed by &s;o many and dreadful vices? How mu&s;t they dete&s;t that &s;y&s;tem of religion, which appears to re&s;i&s;t the natural rights of men, and to give a &s;anction to brutality and murder?</P>
<P>But, as we are now mentioning Chri&s;tianity, we mu&s;t pau&s;e for a little time, to make a few remarks on the arguments which are u&s;ually deduced from thence by the <HI>receivers,</HI> in defence of their &s;y&s;tem of oppre&s;&s;ion. For the reader may readily &s;uppo&s;e, that, if they did not he|&s;itate to bring the <HI>Old</HI> Te&s;tament in &s;upport of their barbarities, they would hardly let the <HI>New</HI> e&s;cape them.</P>
<P><HI>St. Paul,</HI> having converted <HI>Onc&s;imus</HI> to the Chri&s;tian faith, who was a fugitive &s;lave of <HI>Philemon,</HI> &s;ent him back to his ma&s;ter. This circum&s;tance has furni&s;hed the <HI>receivers</HI> with a plea, that Chri&s;tianity encourages &s;lave|ry. But they have not only &s;trained the pa&s;&s;ages which
<PB N="150" REF="019561_0147_0FAC030B2AFF56E8">they produce in &s;upport of their a&s;&s;ertions, but are ig|norant of hi&s;torical facts. The benevolent apo&s;tle, in the letter which he wrote to <HI>Philemon,</HI> the ma&s;ter of <HI>One&s;imus,</HI> addre&s;&s;es him to the following effect: <Q>I &s;end him back to you, but not in his former capacity,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. to Philemon.</NOTE><HI>not now as a &s;ervant, but above a &s;ervant, a brother be|loved.</HI> In this manner I be&s;eech you to receive him, for though I could <HI>enjoin</HI> you to do it, yet I had rather it &s;hould be a matter of your <HI>own will,</HI> than of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It appears that the &s;ame <HI>One&s;imus,</HI> when he was &s;ent back, was no longer <HI>a &s;lave,</HI> that he was a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, that he was joined with <HI>Tychicus</HI> in an eccle|&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion to the church of the <HI>Colo&s;&s;ians,</HI> and was afterwards bi&s;hop of <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI> If language there|fore has any meaning, and if hi&s;tory has recorded a fact which may be believed, there is no ca&s;e more oppo&s;ite to the doctrine of the <HI>receivers,</HI> than this which they pro|duce in its &s;upport.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid again, that Chri&s;tianity, among the many important precepts which it contains, does not furni&s;h us with one for the abolition of &s;lavery. But the rea&s;on is obvious. Slavery at the time of the introduction of the go&s;pel was univer&s;ally prevalent, and if Chri&s;tianity had abruptly declared, that the millions of &s;laves &s;hould have been made free, who were then in the world, it would have been univer&s;ally rejected, as containing doctrines that were dangerous, it not de&s;tructive, to &s;ociety. In order therefore that it might be univer&s;ally received, it never meddled, by any po&s;itive precept, with the civil in&s;titutions of the times: but though it does not expre&s;s|ly &s;ay, that <Q>you &s;hall neither buy, nor &s;ell, nor po&s;|&s;e&s;s a &s;lave,</Q> it is evident that, in its general tenour, it &s;ufficiently militates again&s;t the cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t doctrine which it inculcates, is that of <HI>bro|therly love.</HI> It commands good will towards men. It enjoins us to love our neighbours as our&s;elves, and to do unto all men, as we would that they &s;hould do unto us. And how can any man fulfil this &s;cheme of univer&s;al
<PB N="151" REF="019561_0148_0FAC030BEA30DB88">benevolence, who reduces an unfortunate per&s;on <HI>again&s;t his will,</HI> to the <HI>mo&s;t in&s;upportable</HI> of all human conditi|ons; who con&s;iders him as his <HI>private property,</HI> and treats him, not as a brother, nor as one of the &s;ame pa|rentage with him&s;elf, but as an <HI>animal of the brute cre|ation?</HI></P>
<P>But the mo&s;t important doctrine is that, by which we are a&s;&s;ured that mankind are to exi&s;t in a future &s;tate, and to give an account of tho&s;e actions, which they have &s;everally done in the fle&s;h. This &s;trikes at the very root of &s;lavery. For how can any man be ju&s;tly called to an account for his actions, who&s;e actions are not <HI>at his own di&s;po&s;al?</HI> This is the ca&s;e with the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>African</HI> &s;lave is of this de&s;cription; and we could wi&s;h in all our arguments on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, to be under&s;tood as having &s;poken only of <HI>proper &s;laves.</HI> The &s;lave who is condemned to the oar, to the fortifications, and other publick works, is in a different predica|ment. His liberty is not <HI>appropriated,</HI> and therefore none of tho&s;e con&s;equences can be ju&s;tly drawn, which have been deduced in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</NOTE><HI>proper</HI> &s;lave. His liberty is ab&s;olutely bought and <HI>appropriated;</HI> and if the purcha&s;e is <HI>ju&s;t and equitable,</HI> he is <HI>under the nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of pertetrating any crime, which the purcha&s;er may order him to commit, or, in other words, of ce&s;ing to be <HI>accountable for his actions.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e doctrines therefore are &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that &s;lavery is incompatible with the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem. The <HI>Europeans</HI> con&s;idered them as &s;uch, when, at the clo&s;e of the twelfth century, they re&s;i&s;ted their hereditary prejudices, and occa&s;ioned its abolition. Hence one, among many other proofs, that Chri&s;tianity was the pro|duction of infinite wi&s;dom; that though it did not take &s;uch expre&s;s cognizance of the wicked national in&s;titu|tions of the times, as &s;hould hinder its reception, it &s;hould yet contain &s;uch doctrines, as, when it &s;hould be fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, would be &s;ufficient for the abolition of them all.</P>
<P>Thus then is the argument of you <HI>receivers</HI> ineffectual, and your conduct impious. For, by the pro&s;ecution of
<PB N="152" REF="019561_0149_0FAC030E285A0848">this wicked &s;lavery and commerce, you not only oppo&s;e the propagation of that go&s;pel which was ordered to be preached unto every creature, and bring it into con|tempt, but you oppo&s;e its tenets al&s;o: fir&s;t, becau&s;e you violate that law of <HI>univer&s;al benevolence,</HI> which was to take away tho&s;e hateful di&s;tinctions of <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile, Greek</HI> and <HI>Barbarian, bood</HI> and <HI>free,</HI> which prevailed when the go&s;pel was introduced; and &s;econdly, becau&s;e, as every man is to give an account of his actions hereaf|ter, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould be <HI>free.</HI></P>
<P>Another argument yet remains, which, though nature will ab&s;olutely turn pale at the recital, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be omitted. In tho&s;e wars, which are made for the &s;ake of procuring &s;laves, it is evident that the conte&s;t mu&s;t be generally ob&s;tinate, and that great numbers mu&s;t be &s;lain on both &s;ides, before the event can be determined. This we may rea&s;onably apprehend to be the ca&s;e: and we have<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the de&s;cription of an African battle, p. 72.</NOTE> &s;hewn, that there have not been wanting in&s;tances, where the conquerors have been &s;o incen&s;ed at the re&s;i&s;tance they have found, that their &s;pirit of ven|geance has entirely got the better of their avarice, and they have murdered, in cool blood, every individual, without di&s;crimination, either of age or &s;ex. From the&s;e and other circum&s;tances, we thought we had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to conclude, that, where <HI>ten</HI> were &s;uppo&s;ed to be taken, an <HI>hundred,</HI> including the victors and vanqui&s;h|ed, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to peri&s;h. Now, as the annual exportation from <HI>Africa</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of an hundred thou&s;and men, and as the two orders, of tho&s;e who are privately kidnapped by individuals, and of tho&s;e, who are pub|lickly &s;eized by virtue of the authority of their prince, compo&s;e together, at lea&s;t, nine-tenths of the <HI>African</HI> &s;laves, it follows, that about ten thou&s;and con&s;i&s;t of con|victs and pri&s;oners of war. The la&s;t order is the mo&s;t numerous. Let us &s;uppo&s;e then that only &s;ix thou&s;and of this order are annually &s;ent into &s;ervitude, and it will immediately appear that no le&s;s than <HI>&s;ixty thou&s;and</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="019561_0150_0FAC030E324F8828">people annually peri&s;h in tho&s;e wars, which are made only for the purpo&s;e of procuring &s;laves. But that this number, which we believe to be by no means exagge|rated. may be free from all objection, we will include tho&s;e in the e&s;timate, who die as they are travelling to the &s;hips. Many of the&s;e unfortunate people have a journey of one thou&s;and miles to perform on foot, and are driven like &s;heep through inho&s;pitable woods and de|&s;erts, where they frequently die in great numbers, from fatigue and want. Now if to tho&s;e, who thus peri&s;h on the <HI>African</HI> continent, by war and travelling, we &s;ubjoin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lowe&s;t computation is 40,000, &s;ee p. 93.</NOTE> tho&s;e, who afterwards peri&s;h on the voyage, and in the &s;ea&s;oning together, it will appear that, in every yearly attempt to &s;upply the colonies, an <HI>hundred thou|&s;and</HI> mu&s;t peri&s;h, even before <HI>one</HI> u&s;eful individual can be obtained.</P>
<P>Gracious God! how wicked, how beyond all exam|ple impious, mu&s;t be that &s;ervitude, which cannot be carried on without the continual murder of &s;o many and innocent per&s;ons! What puni&s;hment is not to be expect|ed for &s;uch mon&s;trous and unparalleled barbarities! For if the blood of one man, unju&s;tly &s;hed, cries with &s;o loud a voice for the divine vengeance, how &s;hall the cries and groans of an <HI>hundred thou&s;and</HI> men, <HI>annually mur|dered,</HI> a&s;cend the cele&s;tial man&s;ions, and bring down that puni&s;hment, which &s;uch enormities de&s;erve! But do we mention puni&s;hment? Do we allude to that pu|ni&s;hment, which &s;hall be inflicted on men as individuals, in a future life? Do we allude to that awful day, which &s;hall &s;urely come, when the ma&s;ter &s;hall behold his mur|dered negroe face to face? When a train of mutilated &s;laves &s;hall be brought again&s;t him? When he &s;hall &s;tand confounded and aba&s;hed? Or, do we allude to that pu|ni&s;hment, which may be inflicted on them here, as mem|bers of a wicked community? For as a body politick, if its members are ever &s;o numerous, may be con&s;idered as an whole, acting of it&s;elf, and by it&s;elf, in all affairs

This was &s;ucceeded by one in the year 1697, and by another in the year 1722, from which time to the pre&s;ent, the&s;e regions of the globe &s;eem to have been &s;everely vi&s;ited, but particularly during the la&s;t &s;ix or &s;even years. See a general account of he calamities, occa&s;ioned by the late tre|mendous hurricanes and earthquakes in the We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands, by Mr. Fowler.</NOTE> violent and &s;upernatural agitations of all the elements, which, for a &s;eries of years, have pre|vailed in tho&s;e European &s;ettlements, where the unfortu|nate <HI>Africans</HI> are retained in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, and which have brought un&s;peakable calamities on the inha|bitants, and publick lo&s;&s;es on the &s;tates to which they &s;everally belong, are &s;o many awful vi&s;itations of God
<PB N="155" REF="019561_0152_0FAC0310DA9920B8">for this inhuman violation of his laws. And it is not perhaps unworthy of remark, that as the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain have two thirds of this impious commerce in their own hands, &s;o they have &s;uffered in the &s;ame proportion, or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The many &s;hips of war belonging to the Briti&s;h navy, which were lo&s;t with all their crews in the&s;e dreadful hurricanes, will &s;uf|ficiently prove the fact.</NOTE> more &s;everely than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>How far the&s;e misfortunes may appear to be acts of providence, and to create an alarm to tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to refer every effect to its apparent cau&s;e; who have been habituated to &s;top there, and to overlook the finger of God, becau&s;e it is &s;lightly covered under the veil of &s;econdary laws, we will not pretend to deter|mine? but this we will a&s;&s;ert with confidence, that the <HI>Europeans</HI> have richly de&s;erved them all; that the tear of &s;ympathy, which can hardly be re&s;trained on other me|lancholy occa&s;ions, &s;eems to forget to flow at the relation of the&s;e; and that we can never, with any &s;hadow of ju&s;tice, wi&s;h pro&s;perity to the undertakings of tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t be at the expence of the happine&s;s of millions of their fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>But this is &s;ufficient. For if liberty is only an ad|ventitious right; if men are by no means &s;uperiour to brutes; if every &s;ocial duty is a cur&s;e; if cruelty is high|ly to be e&s;teemed; if murder is &s;trictly honourable, and Chri&s;tianity is a lye; then it is evident, that the <HI>African</HI> &s;lavery may be pur&s;ued, without either the remor&s;e of con&s;cience, or the imputation of a crime. But if the contrary of this is true, which rea&s;on mu&s;t immediately evince, it is evident that no cu&s;tom e&s;tabli&s;hed among men was ever more impious; &s;ince it is contrary to <HI>rea|&s;on, ju&s;tice, nature, the principles of law and government, the whole doctrine, in &s;hort, of natural religion, and the revealed voice of God.</HI></P>
