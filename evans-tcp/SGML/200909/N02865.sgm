<P>_THIS Epi&s;tle may not unfitly be intitled <HI>Paul's</HI> CHARGE to <HI>Timothy.</HI> The profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of it is to give him In&s;tructions for a right Conduct in the Church of GOD. The Apo&s;tle &s;eeing occa&s;ion to go into <HI>Macedonia,</HI> be&s;ought <HI>Timothy</HI> to abide &s;till at <HI>Ephe&s;us:</HI> to the end he might con|firm the Souls of the Di&s;ciples, and e&s;tabli&s;h them in the faith and order of the Go&s;pel; pre|&s;erve the purity of Chri&s;tian Doctrine and Wor&s;hip in the Church there, and propagate it in places round about.
<PB N="2" REF="003421_0004_0FF83BD353EC8A48">
For the &s;ame Cau&s;e doubtle&s;s left he <HI>Timothy</HI> at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> as <HI>Titus</HI> at <HI>Crete;</HI> that he might <HI>&s;et in order the things which were wanting,</HI> fill up the &s;everal Offices of Chri&s;t's appointment with Per&s;ons duly qualify'd for the execution of them, and &s;ettle things referring to Divine Wor&s;hip, Government and Di&s;cipline in the Hou&s;e of GOD, in a ju&s;t conformity to the Rule of Chri&s;t's revealed Will.</P>
<P>In the Chapter before us we have the <HI>two Orders</HI> of publick Officers, Bi&s;hops and Deacons, treated of. The Apo&s;tle commends them, &s;aying, <HI>He that de&s;ires the Office of a Bi&s;hop, de&s;ires a good Work;</HI> and <HI>they that have u&s;ed the Office of a Deacon well, purcha&s;e to them|&s;elves a good degree.</HI>&mdash; He al&s;o gives the di&s;tinct Qua|lifications for the&s;e Offices, in order to direct the Choice of proper Per&s;ons for the Admini&s;tration of them. He fir&s;t lays down the nece&s;&s;ary Properties of a Bi&s;hop or Pa&s;tor, from <HI>ver.</HI> 2, to 7. And then draws the Deacons Character, <HI>ver.</HI> 8, and onwards. <HI>Likewi&s;e mu&s;t the Deacons be grave, not double-tongued,</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; He wou'd have Candidates <HI>try'd</HI> by the&s;e Rules, and being approv'd, wou'd have them <HI>u&s;e the Office,</HI> ver. 10. &mdash; And in <HI>ver.</HI> 13. he encourages both <HI>Timothy</HI> to ordain meet Per&s;ons unto, and &s;uch to accept of, the Office of a Deacon, from this Con&s;ideration, that they who <HI>u&s;e it well,</HI> do <HI>purcha&s;e to them&s;elves a good degree, and great bold|ne&s;s in the Faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>What is nece&s;&s;ary for the Explanation of the Words, may be offer'd in &s;peaking to the&s;e Ob&s;ervations from them, which are to be the Arguments of the following Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Service of <HI>Deacons</HI> in the Church of Chri&s;t is a <HI>&s;tanding Office,</HI> belonging to a <HI>di&s;tinct Order</HI> of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. Per&s;ons are to be fir&s;t <HI>proved,</HI> and then to u&s;e this Office, being found <HI>blamele&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Con&s;ideration, that &s;uch as u&s;e the Office of a Deacon <HI>well,</HI> do <HI>purcha&s;e to them&s;elves a good degree,</HI> and great boldne&s;s in the Faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, affords encouragement both to the <HI>Calling</HI> and <HI>Ordain|ing</HI> of meet Per&s;ons unto this Office, and their <HI>engaging</HI> in it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Propo&s;itions lie plainly in the Text, or are very fairly deduced from it.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003421_0005_0FF83BD4DDB32258">DOCT. I. <HI>The Service of</HI> Deacons <HI>in the Church of Chri&s;t is a</HI> &s;tanding <HI>Office, belonging to a</HI> di&s;tinct <HI>Order of Men:</HI> or thus, Deacons are a di&s;tinct Order of Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Officers, &s;eparated to a &s;pecial Mini&s;tration, and appointed by Chri&s;t to continue in his Church thro' all Ages.</P>
<P>The Pro&s;ecution of this Point will open to your View the principal <HI>Grounds</HI> of the Sacred Tran&s;action before us this Day: &s;ome Account of which I apprehend it nece&s;&s;ary to preface this Solemnity with; as our Practice in the Ordination of Deacons is become now almo&s;t &s;ingular, and as an Account of &s;uch publick Actions &s;eems a Debt ju&s;tly owing to GOD and our Neighbours.</P>
<P>Here let it be ob&s;erv'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis not to be di&s;puted but that <HI>there was &s;uch an Office,</HI> as this of Deacons, <HI>in&s;tituted</HI> and <HI>receiv'd</HI> in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> days of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>By <HI>Office,</HI> I mean a &s;pecial Calling, appropriate to a particular Order of Men, and not common to other Mem|bers of the Community.</P>
<P>By <HI>Deacons,</HI> I mean tho&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Officers, who have the Care of the publick Stock for pious &amp; charitable U&s;es committed to them. Indeed the Word <GAP DESC="foreign"> I acknowledge, literally Signifies no more than <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> or <HI>Servants,</HI> and is often us'd according to its general and primary meaning <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> 22.13. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3 5. <HI>Rom</HI> 13 4 <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Rom.</HI> 15 8.</NOTE>. However the word is not always us'd in that Latitude; but manife&s;tly &s;ometimes with Re|&s;triction, for a particular kind of Officer in the Church of Chri&s;t. As <GAP DESC="foreign"> admits a re&s;train'd, as well as large Sen&s;e; literally and fir&s;tly meaning any <HI>Over&s;eer,</HI> but yet &s;ometimes intending a particular Church Officer: So the Word <GAP DESC="foreign">, tho' it &s;trictly &s;ignifies any Mi|ni&s;ter or Servant, yet has a limited &s;en&s;e, and is in its Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Application generally the name of a parti|cular Officer in the Church, who&s;e &s;pecial bu&s;ine&s;s is to receive and di&s;tribute what is offer'd from time to time by the Church for works of Piety and Charity. The word in our Text is judged by all Expo&s;itors to be a Title of Office; and that particular &s;ort of Officer, ju&s;t now de&s;crib'd, the generality judge is thereby denoted.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003421_0006_0FF83BD66962E4F8">Mo&s;t evident it is that there was &s;uch a kind of Officer of Divine Appointment. We have an Account of the In&s;titution of the Officer, we judge denoted by the Term or Name of Deacon, in the 6th <HI>Chap.</HI> of <HI>Acts;</HI> where we may &s;ee the Occa&s;ion of their Appointment, and the Scope of their Calling, which was to <HI>&s;erve Tables,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, to be Deacons to Tables, as one expre&s;&s;es it.</P>
<P>We are told here, there aro&s;e a Murmuring among the <HI>Helleni&s;tical</HI> Jews, that their Widows (under which are comprehended the Fatherle&s;s and Poor) were not &s;o well attended and provided for, as the Poor of the native <HI>Hebrews,</HI> in the <HI>daily Mini&s;tration.</HI> To explain this we mu&s;t note, the Church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> had by a com|mon Agreement made a publick Fund or Stock, which was to &s;upply every one's daily occa&s;ions; and e&s;pecially the Mini&s;ters of the Word and the indigent Members of the Church were to have their Maintenance out of it. See <HI>Act.</HI> 2.44, 45. and <HI>chap.</HI> 4.34, &mdash;37.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles for a while took the care of the Church-Stock, and &s;uperintended the daily Mini&s;tration to the Saints. They had opportunity for this, &s;ince at fir&s;t they made <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> the place of their u&s;ual Re&s;idence: An|tiquity (if I remember right) &s;ays, they did &s;o for about 12 Years. And being Per&s;ons of an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Reputation, as well as &s;uperiour Dignity by their excelling Accom|pli&s;hments, and &s;o peculiarly worthy of Tru&s;t and Con|fidence; the Di&s;ciples, when they brought the Prices of their Goods and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;old, in order to have all things in common, thought fit to lay them down at the Apo&s;tles Feet: doubtle&s;s (as in another Ca&s;e, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.4) <HI>Praying them with much Intreaty, that they wou'd re|ceive the Gifts</HI> into their Di&s;po&s;ition, <HI>and take upon them the Fellow&s;hip of the Mini&s;tring to the Saints.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly the Apo&s;tles &s;ubmitted to take the Charge of this Fund for the pre&s;ent, receiving and paying out the Monies collected; and perhaps the Di&s;tribution might at fir&s;t be per&s;onally perform'd by them: but the number of Di&s;ciples increa&s;ing, and &s;o Cares multiplying on the Apo&s;tles hands, 'tis likely they took in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of others (and tho&s;e probably &s;uch as were call'd by way of di&s;tinction <HI>Hebrews,</HI> being Natives of <HI>Judea,</HI> and &s;o
<PB N="5" REF="003421_0007_0FF83BD9E28AD5A0">
might be under a Temptation to Partiality) who by general Orders from them help'd to manage this Affair. And up|on occa&s;ion of &s;ome imprudent unequal Conduct, either real or &s;uppo&s;ed, there aro&s;e among the <HI>Helleni&s;tical</HI> Di&s;|ciples a Complaint that their Widows or Poor were neg|lected in the daily Mini&s;tration.&mdash; It's too commonly the fault of poor People to imagine they are &s;lighted; and in&s;tead of being thankful for what is given them by charitable Per&s;ons, they often grow querulous, and mur|mur that <HI>more</HI> is not given. And where any lie under &s;ome peculiar Di&s;advantages, as the <HI>Helleni&s;ts</HI> did in Compare with the <HI>Native Jews,</HI> they are apt to be jea|lous, in ca&s;e of general Di&s;tributions, that Things are ma|nag'd with Partiality, and a criminal Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons; when really there is no ju&s;t foundation for any &s;uch Cen|&s;ures. &mdash; Or, if the Apo&s;tles employ'd any of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> under them, the&s;e might be really faulty in not giving a due Proportion of Supplies to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Widows. For tho' in Chri&s;t Je&s;us there be neither <HI>Jew</HI> nor <HI>Greek;</HI> no Di&s;tinction of <HI>Hebrew</HI> or <HI>Helleni&s;t:</HI> Yet it &s;eems they that were united in the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, had not quite laid a&s;ide their former Prejudices, but &s;till retain'd &s;omething of the old Leven. There were mutual Envyings and Jealou&s;ies &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among them: and their fir&s;t Contention was about a Money-matter.</P>
<P>Now upon con&s;ideration of the&s;e Difficulties, the Apo&s;tles were di&s;pos'd to excu&s;e them&s;elves from any further attendance to the charitable Mini&s;tration: and being directed thereto by the Holy Gho&s;t, as we cannot doubt, &s;ince in all Affairs of Importance to the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, the Apo&s;tles acted under a Divine In&s;piration, they mov'd it to the Church, That a Select Number of the Brethren &s;hould be appointed on purpo&s;e to look after the di&s;tribution of the Church's Money. &mdash; <HI>ver.</HI> 2, 3, &amp; 4. It follows, <HI>ver.</HI> 5, &amp; 6. <HI>And the Saying plea&s;ed the whole Multitude,</HI> both Jews &amp; Greeks: <HI>and they cho&s;e Seven Men; whom they &s;et before the Apo&s;tles, and when they had pray'd, they laid their Hands upon them,</HI> Or|daining them Stewards and Di&s;pen&s;ers of the collected Charities.</P>
<P>Under a Divine direction they did this; as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in a &s;omewhat like ca&s;e, appointed inferiour Officers in the
<PB N="6" REF="003421_0008_0FF83BDC73F38B98">
Jewi&s;h Common-Wealth, <HI>Deut.</HI> 1. Upon which one ob|&s;erves, <Q><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had no Regal or Arbitrary Authority at all: but was only GOD'S Secretary, to write his Mind; and GOD'S In&s;trument, to publi&s;h &amp; execute his Laws.</Q> And look, what <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was to the <HI>Jews,</HI> that were the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> unto the Chri&s;tian Church, the Revealers and Interpreters of GOD'S Law, and GOD'S Vice-gerents, who in his Name and according to his Will, &s;ettled the Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Policy under the Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;ation. Hence, doubtle&s;s they might u&s;e that Form of Expre&s;&s;ion in this, as in other Ca&s;es, <HI>It &s;eemeth good to the</HI> HOLY GHOST, as well as <HI>to us.</HI></P>
<P>Now we have rea&s;on to look on what they did upon this Occa&s;ion, as the In&s;tituting and e&s;tabli&s;hing of a di&s;|tinct publick Office in the Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>It's plain, the Attending upon <HI>Tables</HI> was now made a &s;pecial Mini&s;try in the Church; an Office divided from that of Teachers. For the Apo&s;tles &s;ecluded them&s;elves from that Service, and procur'd others to be devoted to that particular Charge: And their whole Management and Language upon this Occa&s;ion were &s;uch as imported the Specification of a Calling peculiar and di&s;tinct from the other Officers and Members. <HI>Ver.</HI> 2, 3, 4. <HI>It is not Rea&s;on, that we &s;hould leave the Word of GOD, and &s;erve Tables. Wherefore look ye out among you &s;even Men, whom we may appoint over this Bu&s;ine&s;s. But we will give our&s;elves continually to Prayer and to the Mini&s;try of the Word.</HI> The &s;erving of Tables is here manife&s;tly &s;eparated from the Office of Teachers, and made a particular Mini&s;try in the Church, the di&s;cretive and proper Charge of Deacons. Hence the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in his Writings, &s;everal times mentions <HI>Deacons,</HI> as Officers di&s;tingui&s;h'd from Bi&s;hops or Teachers. <Q>That it is a di&s;tinct publick Office (&s;ays one of our vene|rable Divines <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hooker,</HI> Survey, Part 2. <HI>pag.</HI> 34.</NOTE>) is apparent, becau&s;e the Seven were elected in a &s;olemn manner thereto, and receiv'd a &s;olemn In&s;titution from the Apo&s;tles, and &s;o far from Chri&s;t for the undertaking of that Service.</Q></P>
<P>While the Apo&s;tles attended the Mini&s;tration to the Saints, they only did it in a way of <HI>Charity:</HI> Whereas the
<PB N="7" REF="003421_0009_0FF83BDECC981348">
Per&s;ons afterwards <HI>appointed over this Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> were to do it in a way of <HI>Office,</HI> as a Work particularly theirs by a Divine A&s;&s;ignment.</P>
<P>The Deacon&s;hip from this time became an appropriate Office, &amp; was no more left at large, or impos'd on Teach|ers of the Word: Tho' indeed upon &s;ome &s;pecial Occa&s;ions the Apo&s;tles and Evangeli&s;ts, as they travel'd from place to place, we find carrying extraordinary Charities.</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve here,</P>
<P>It &s;eems to have been but <HI>fitting,</HI> that &s;uch an Office &s;hould be appointed, and lodg'd in the Hands of a &s;pecial Order of Men. 'Twas requi&s;ite, in the nature of things, that the &s;erving of Tables &s;hould be made a particular Tru&s;t, and a&s;&s;ign'd to certain Selected Per&s;ons. For if it lay in Common, it would be &s;een, that what is every Man's Work would be often neglected, as no Body's Con|cern. And 'twas already found by Experience inconvenient for Teachers of the Word to &s;u&s;tain and manage this Tru&s;t; as unavoidably inferring too great a Diver&s;ion from their proper Employ, which is of a more &s;piritual and noble de&s;ign, and expo&s;ing them to the Cen&s;ures of en|vious di&s;contented People; and by Con&s;equence tending to hinder the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The Nature of the Deacons Tru&s;t was &s;uch as required &s;ome Gifts &amp; Qualifications, that were not to be found in every one: And the Difficulties, Cares &amp; Labours attend|ing the faithful Di&s;charge of it, &s;uch as made it un&s;uit|able for Teachers of the Word to be concerned therein. 'Twas a mo&s;t wi&s;e and rea&s;onable thing then to commit this Office to &s;ome other Per&s;ons, cho&s;en by the Church, and approv'd by the Apo&s;tles, as meet for it.</P>
<P>And now, the in&s;pired <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> concurring in the &s;o|lemn Appointment of tho&s;e, whom the Church elected, unto the Bu&s;ine&s;s of mini&s;tring to the Saints, this (I &s;ay) &s;peaks the Office of Deacons to be as really the In&s;titution of Chri&s;t, as the Office of Teachers. It is not to be look'd on as owing to mere human Contrivance &amp; Agreement, but as taking it's Ri&s;e from the In&s;titution and revealed Will of Chri&s;t. Nor is it to be blended with the Mini&s;try of the Word, but pre&s;erv'd &s;eparate; as having its own di&s;tinct Divine Original and Foundation.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003421_0010_0FF83BE0569EB1F8">I &s;hall only add, in the Words of a Learned Man <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitby</HI> on Act. 6.</NOTE>: <Q>If Deacons were not in&s;tituted here by the Apo&s;tles, I de&s;ire to know when, where, and by whom they were in&s;tituted; and what other Record we have left us of the In&s;titution of them. Again&s;t this (&s;ays he) it is objected, That the&s;e Seven are never called <HI>Deacons</HI> in the whole Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apo&s;tles. But (he an&s;wers) this objection can be of no &s;trength again&s;t the Suffrage of all Antiquity, which hath &s;till given them the Name of Deacons. He further ob|&s;erves, In the whole Book of the <HI>Acts,</HI> neither are they ever call'd <HI>Mini&s;ters of Tables,</HI> tho' here they are &s;aid to be appointed for that Work.</Q></P>
<P>Enough, I think, has been offer'd to clear the Divine Right of the Deacons Office, and to prove it &s;eparate from that of Teachers, according to the expre&s;s Intent of it's primitive In&s;titution.</P>
<P>We pa&s;s now to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="2">2. It was de&s;ign'd to be a <HI>&s;tanding</HI> Office, and the In&s;titution is of <HI>la&s;ting, univer&s;al</HI> Obligation to the Churches of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It's very manife&s;t, the Apo&s;tles in&s;tituted this Office with a view to the Benefit of all the Churches, and in|tended it for a perpetual Duration. The original In&s;ti|tution neither limited it in regard of Place, nor Time. This is generally acknowledg'd by all Parties: yet, be|cau&s;e there are &s;ome Objectors, I will a little labour the Confirmation of the Point; and &s;hew,</P>
<P N="1">1. In regard of <HI>Place,</HI> 'twas be&s;ure not limited to the Church of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed on immediate Rea&s;on of the In&s;titution of the Deacons Office was a particular Occa&s;ion ri&s;ing in the Church there: And we don't read of the &s;ame Rea&s;on for that Office el&s;ewhere; I mean, a Community of Goods, and daily Mini&s;tration. But yet it's Fact that el&s;ewhere we find the &s;ame Office &s;et up, in one Church and another. The Apo&s;tle writing to the Church at <HI>Philippi,</HI> mentions in his Super&s;cription, <HI>the Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI> It's manife&s;t, the two Orders here men|tion'd,
<PB N="9" REF="003421_0011_0FF83BE262F153E8">
intend Officers belonging to that Church and dwelling at <HI>Philippi</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See this matter argu'd by Dr <HI>Whitby</HI> in his Notes on the Place. As al&s;o in <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> Edit. 2. p 91.</NOTE>. So then, the Church there had Deacons, as well as Bi&s;hops. This &s;hews plainly, the Ap|pointment of tho&s;e Per&s;ons at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to &s;erve Tables, was not a <HI>Topical</HI> thing, but de&s;ign'd as <HI>exemplary</HI> and <HI>obligatory</HI> to other Churches.</P>
<P>We have the Con&s;ent of all <HI>Antiquity,</HI> that the Dea|cons here &s;poken of, are that kind of Officers in&s;tituted in <HI>Act.</HI> 6. who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;erve Tables: And we have good <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> to judge, this particular kind of Officers is denoted by that Term in this place. As one ob&s;erves <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pierce,</HI> Letters, I. pag. 35.</NOTE>, <Q>The Name, when appropriated to Officers in the Chri&s;tian Church, does fully agree with the Bu&s;ine&s;s and the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion of tho&s;e whom we un|der&s;tand by it. And as the di&s;tributing the Church's Charity was call'd by the Name <GAP DESC="foreign">, and the Seven were &s;et over this Bu&s;ine&s;s, it &s;eems that hence came the Name of <GAP DESC="foreign"> to be us'd to &s;ignify &s;uch Officers.</Q></P>
<P>Some Epi&s;copal Writers indeed wou'd pretend the Deacons here &s;poken of, to be <HI>Pre&s;byters&punc;</HI> or Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters. &mdash; But as Bi&s;hops and Deacons are here men|tion'd together by way of Di&s;tinction, it's plain, the Deacons in this place intend tho&s;e Church-Officers who were in&s;tituted for the &s;erving of Tables, and not the Mini&s;try of the Word. For there are but the&s;e two &s;tanding Orders, of Divine In&s;titution. The Opinion that makes the&s;e Deacons to be Go&s;pel-Mini|&s;ters or Teachers, is founded in another Mi&s;take, as if there were two Orders or unequal Ranks of Go&s;pel-Teachers, <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byters:</HI> But it labours of this unhappy Dfficulty (which I know not how any can rationally &s;alve) That they are able to produce a Divine Commi&s;|&s;ion for but <HI>One only;</HI> and by Con&s;equence the pretended Di&s;tinction and Imparity of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters mu&s;t be exploded, as un&s;criptural, if we wou'd manife&s;t a &s;incere Attachment to the Word of Chri&s;t, as our go|verning Rule in Matters Divine. Whereas, for Bi&s;hops and <HI>Deacons</HI> according to <HI>our</HI> Notion and Application
<PB N="10" REF="003421_0012_0FF83BE57874B2A0">
of tho&s;e Terms, we are able to point out a di&s;tinct In|&s;titution for each, in the holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>And here we find both Orders mention'd by the A|po&s;tle, together and by way of Di&s;tinction, as being in the Church at <HI>Philippi.</HI></P>
<P>And now upon this I can't refrain ob&s;erving, That I doubt not the Contenders for Prelacy wou'd have triumph'd in it, as an unan&s;werable Argument in favour of their Opinion, had the Text run, [<HI>with the Bi&s;hops and</HI> PRESBYTERS] and they wou'd have urg'd it as a mo&s;t plau&s;ible Support of the Di&s;tinction they put between them. But &s;ince the Pa&s;&s;age &s;tands otherwi&s;e, they have invented a forc'd Con&s;truction of one of the Names (not to take any Notice of their De&s;cants upon the other) and wou'd make <HI>Deacons</HI> intend <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> contrary to the generally receiv'd Notion of the Term, when us'd to &s;ignify a Church-Officer, and contrary to the evident Sen&s;e of the Word as u&s;ed by the &s;ame Apo&s;tle in his Epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy;</HI> which any unbias'd Per&s;on mu&s;t be convinc'd of, by this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration, That the De&s;cription there given of <HI>Deacons</HI> altogether omits one of the fundamental Articles in the Character of <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> viz. <HI>An Aptne&s;s to teach.</HI></P>
<P>And Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> a celebrated Epi&s;copal Annotator, is fully of opinion, that as by <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> in the Scripture-u&s;e of the Word, are to be under&s;tood the Pa&s;tors of par|ticular Churches, &s;o <Q>by the <HI>Deacons</HI> are to be under|&s;tood in this place, being joyn'd to <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> tho&s;e that attend on them in every Church, and were then <HI>next to them;</HI> there being not then any <HI>middle</HI> &s;ort of Church Officers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such as are now call'd <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in the Church of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> in&s;tituted betwixt the Bi&s;hops and them. And the &s;ame (&s;ays he) is certainly the Notion of the Word, in that other place, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.8, 12. where the Rules are given for the qualifying them that are ordained to that Office.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;ugge&s;ts a further Argument to e&s;tabli&s;h the Point we are upon, <HI>viz,</HI> That the Office in&s;tituted <HI>Acts</HI> 6. was not a thing <HI>local</HI> in its de&s;ign, I mean, not intended to be confin'd to the Church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI> For <HI>Timothy</HI> was in&s;tructed in the Qualifications of Deacons, <HI>to the &s;ame End,</HI> that he was al&s;o in the Qualifications of Bi&s;hops,
<PB N="11" REF="003421_0013_0FF83BE71973ABB8">
namely, for his Direction in the Appointment of &s;uch Officers in the Churches, wherever as an Evangeli&s;t he travel'd to &s;et in order the things that were wanting.</P>
<P>Agreeably the Apo&s;tle writing to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> takes Notice (1 Epi&s;t. Chap. 12.) That <HI>God has &s;et in his Church</HI> HELPS: which Expre&s;&s;ion is generally un|der&s;tood to denote a particular kind of Officer, and is both by Epi&s;copal and Presbyterian Writers apply'd to <HI>Deacons,</HI> as mo&s;t naturally referring to them <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dr <HI>Whitby</HI> on the place ob&s;erves <GAP DESC="foreign">. from whence comes the word render'd <HI>Helps,</HI> &s;ignifies to take care of others.</NOTE>. The&s;e the Apo&s;tle tells us, GOD hath <HI>&s;et in his Church.</HI></P>
<P>Now upon the whole, let it be ob&s;erv'd; If the Churches in a Variety of places had Deacons con&s;tituted in them by Apo&s;tolical Direction, it argues the Office was not under a Limitation (either actual or intentional) to the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> altho' the In&s;titution took place there fir&s;t of all. And then if the Churches in general at that day, when reduc'd to a &s;ettled State and the Order, in which they were to continue, had Deacons appointed in them, this &s;urely affords a &s;trong pre&s;umtive Argument, that the&s;e Officers were de&s;ign'd al&s;o for an unlimited Continuance in the Churches, as being of uni|ver&s;al Advantage and perpetual U&s;e. For the primitive Churches in an organized State, as at <HI>Philippi,</HI> at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> &amp;c. were intended <HI>Patterns,</HI> for the Con&s;titution, Go|vernment and Order of the Churches in all &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Ge|nerations.</P>
<P>But this leads me to the other Head. &mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. In regard of <HI>Time,</HI> this Office of Deacons was not limited to the <HI>Apo&s;tolical</HI> Age.</P>
<P>As it was not topical, &s;o neither temporal, in its fir&s;t De&s;ign. To confirm this, a few Arguments may be di&s;tinctly offer'd. As</P>
<P N="1">1. The primitive In&s;titution has never been <HI>repealed:</HI> which is a Con&s;ideration, that I think &s;ufficiently infers the perpetual Continuance of the Office.</P>
<P>The Scriptures, which were given by In&s;piration of GOD, are our &s;upreme Directory in Church-Affairs, and by them we are to learn and judge what Officers Chri&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="003421_0014_0FF83BE930D06238">
hath &s;et in his Church. The Sovereignty of the Lord Je&s;us, as Head of the Church, is to be acknowledg'd by taking our Directions from his Word in all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Concerns. 'Tis an un&s;ufferable Encroachment on his Prerogative, to &s;et up any Office in the Church, without the Authority of a Divine Appointment: And on the other hand, 'tis daring Pre&s;umption to reject any of his Sacred Appointments, without the Authority of a Divine Repeal.</P>
<P>Now, the Office of Deacon&s;hip, as it is by univer&s;al Con&s;ent originally an In&s;titution of Chri&s;t; &s;o it &s;tands, by the cleare&s;t Evidence, yet unrevok'd. If a Revocation be &s;uppos'd, it mu&s;t be either virtual and implicit, or formal and expre&s;s. A virtual Repeal there wou'd have been, in ca&s;e the Rea&s;ons of the In&s;titution, or Qualifica|tions of the Per&s;ons, had been altogether extraordinary and temporary: but, as I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;hew under &s;ome en&s;uing Heads, this was not the Ca&s;e. And if there be not an implicit Repeal, it &s;eems the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Ab&s;urdity, and a Reflection on the Wi&s;dom of Chri&s;t in the original Appointment, to imagine there was or cou'd be an expre&s;s Abrogation.</P>
<P>And agreeably, if we &s;earch the Scriptures, we &s;hall find that in fact there has never been any formal and explicit Repeal of this Evangelic In&s;titution. The whole New Te&s;tament is &s;ilent on this Head: which, tho' a negative Con&s;ideration, yet taken in its Circum&s;tances carries Force and Weight with it, as a good pre&s;umptive Argument for the Stability of the Ordinance, and may help to &s;ilence the Cavils of tho&s;e who reject it as ob&s;olete.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>general Rea&s;on</HI> of the In&s;titution remains thro' all Ages: There was nothing in the <HI>Nature of the Office</HI> of Deacons, that requir'd it to be temporary.</P>
<P>Tho' it might be with a more particular View to a tran&s;ient Occa&s;ion, I mean the Community of Goods and daily Mini&s;tration at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that this Office was originally appointed; yet that mu&s;t be acknowledged to conclude nothing again&s;t the Permanence of the In&s;titu|tion: unle&s;s at the &s;ame time you will grant (as you mu&s;t by parity of Rea&s;on) that the <HI>extraordinary</HI> Purpo&s;es of the <HI>Apo&s;tolical</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion do afford a ju&s;t Objection a|gain&s;t a <HI>&s;tanding</HI> Mini&s;try, or the Office of ordinary Teach|ers. But who, except Dei&s;ts &amp; Quakers, can &s;ee any force of Argument, or will acknowledge the Con&s;equence, in <HI>this</HI> Ca&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003421_0015_0FF83BEB5A160638">We look on the <HI>Apo&s;tolick</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion (in <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.) by the ju&s;te&s;t and faire&s;t deduction, to in&s;titute a <HI>&s;etled Mini&s;try</HI> in the Church for a perpetual Succe&s;&s;ion; the Mini&s;try of unin&s;pir'd Teachers, <HI>for the edifying of the Body of Chri&s;t,</HI> the pre&s;erving and building up of the Church already founded. And yet it's certain, that this Commi&s;&s;ion was given primarily and immediately to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> who were in&s;pir'd Per&s;ons: and that more e&s;pecially for Ends of an extraordinary &amp; temporary Na|ture; the witne&s;&s;ing to Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection, the reveal|ing of his Doctrine and completing the Canon of Sacred Scripture, the carrying of his Go&s;pel to the Gentiles, modelling a new Church-State, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which prime &amp; extra|ordinary purpo&s;es determin'd with the Apo&s;tolick Age. However, this notwith&s;tanding, 'tis acknowledg'd by all, that the Apo&s;tolical Commi&s;&s;ion founded a &s;tanding Mi|ni&s;try, for purpo&s;es of a more ordinary &amp; durable nature, to continue through all Ages: which is &s;ufficiently evi|dent from that &s;ingle Con&s;ideration, the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> annexed to the Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Lo! I am with you alway to the end of the World.</HI></P>
<P>"Hence (as one ob&s;erves) Mini&s;ters now, duly called, are upon the &s;ame Divine Foundation with the Apo&s;tles, and their Mini&s;trations under the &s;ame Divine Warrant and Benediction. The Mini&s;try is not a Superannuated In&s;titution. Since there are Ends and Grounds of an or|dinary nature, which require a &s;tanding Mini&s;try, it argues <HI>this</HI> mu&s;t be intended in the Apo&s;tolick Commi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e Grounds and De&s;igns of the Mini&s;try abiding &s;till, therefore &s;o doth the Ordinance that is founded on them".</P>
<P>Now, with equal Rea&s;on, it may be &s;aid, Neither is the Office of <HI>Deacons</HI> to be reckon'd an Antiquated In&s;titu|tion, a thing out of Date. For there being certain Ends and Grounds of this Office, which abide &s;till, therefore &s;o doth the In&s;titution in full force and vertue. Though &s;ome of the fir&s;t Purpo&s;es of it might be occa&s;ional and temporary; yet there being <HI>others,</HI> of a more ordinary and &s;tanding Nature, and univer&s;al Concernment, we may from hence ju&s;tly infer its la&s;ting Obligation. As long as there is proper <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> for the Deacon, the Office ought to take place, be receiv'd and maintain'd: And as long as there are <HI>Tables</HI> to be &s;erv'd, there mu&s;t &amp; will
<PB N="14" REF="003421_0016_0FF810EDAAA99D98">
be Bu&s;ine&s;s proper for this Officer. Now as long as Chri&s;t has <HI>a vi&s;ible Church</HI> and People in the World, there <HI>will be</HI> Tables to be &s;erv'd.</P>
<P>If it was originally one Care of the Deacons to make the nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion for the <HI>Lord's Table,</HI> and be Ser|vitours or Waiters at the Holy Supper, to di&s;tribute the con&s;ecrated Bread and Wine among the Communicants; <HI>This</HI> is a Bu&s;ine&s;s that continues &s;till: and the Decency and Propriety of &s;tated Per&s;ons to attend on this Bu&s;ine&s;s, are &s;uch as afford an Argument for the Continuance of the Order of Deacons unto that End.</P>
<P>Again, if it was originally the Deacons particular Care to &s;ee to the comfortable Support of the <HI>Teaching Officers,</HI> that they which <HI>preach the Go&s;pel may live of the Go&s;pel, be provided with what is comely,</HI> and have &s;ecur'd to 'em the <HI>double Honour,</HI> which all confe&s;s is their ju&s;t Wages, that they may attend on the Lord without Di&s;traction; <HI>This</HI> al&s;o is a &s;tanding Care: and the Expediency of the Church's having &s;tated Per&s;ons to regard this as their proper Concern, &s;till be&s;peaks the Sub&s;i&s;ting of the Office of Deacons.</P>
<P>In fine, If it was originally one De&s;ign and Work of the Deacons, in behalf of the Church, to take Care of the <HI>Poor</HI> Saints, the Stranger, the Widow and Fatherle&s;s, the Sick and Impotent; <HI>This</HI> likewi&s;e being a Duty of per|petual obligation on the Church of Chri&s;t, and the Con|venience, the Importance of having &s;tated known Per&s;ons to attend continually on this very Thing, being &s;o evi|dent, it nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ults from hence al&s;o, that the Office of Deacons is of perpetual Continuance by Divine In&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>Upon this Argument I wou'd a little enlarge, and &s;ay for the obviating a common Objection; I am humbly of Opinion, The Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Deacon is no &s;uch circum&s;tan|tial thing, as to be left precarious, and liable to be &s;uper|&s;eded by any Provi&s;ion, which civil Communities may make for their poor Members. For &s;uch Communities, as Civil, mu&s;t and will equally re&s;pect their Poor, with|out a Di&s;tinction of any for their <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Character. Whereas now the Lord Chri&s;t expects of his profe&s;&s;ing Peo|ple, that they particularly regard the poor <HI>Saints;</HI> Do|ing good to all Men, but <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> to them which are
<PB N="15" REF="003421_0017_0FF83BF0B885AE48">
of the <HI>Hou&s;ehold of Faith, (Gal.</HI> 6.10.) And promi&s;es Divine Rewards only unto Charities given to Di&s;ciples <HI>in the name of Di&s;ciples,</HI> Matth. 10.42. Our Saviour has ob&s;erv'd to us, <HI>Matth.</HI> 26.11. <HI>The Poor ye have</HI> ALWAYS <HI>with you,</HI> to furni&s;h out Occa&s;ions and call you to the Exerci&s;e of Charity. And ye remember the Words of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> how he &s;aid, <HI>It is more ble&s;&s;ed to give, than to receive,</HI> (Act. 20.35.) e&s;pecially to give to the poor Saints. This our Lord mentions as the <HI>grand Te&s;t</HI> in the great Day, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25.40. <HI>Ina&s;much as ye have done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my Brethren, ye have done it unto me&mdash;.</HI> And this Charity is the Duty of every Church of Chri&s;t; collectively con&s;ider'd, as well as &s;eparately in particular per&s;ons. The Apo&s;tle com|mends the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Macedonia</HI> for the Riches of their Liberality; who to their Power (he bears Record) yea, and <HI>beyond their Power,</HI> were willing to communicate, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.1, 2, 3.&mdash; And to the Church at <HI>Corinth</HI> he writes (1 Epi&s;t. 16.1.) <HI>Now concerning the Collection for the Saints, as I have given Order to the Churches of</HI> Galatia, <HI>even &s;o do ye.&mdash;</HI>But perhaps it may be objected, This Text relates to an extraordinary Ca&s;e in tho&s;e Times of Per&s;ecution. I will then produce another Scripture, wherein we have a Rule, evidently (it may be, as any of the in&s;pir'd Apo&s;tolick Canons) of &s;tanding Obligation; 'tis that in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.16. <HI>If any Man or Woman, that be|lieveth, have Widows (i. e.</HI> near Relations poor &amp; ne|ce&s;&s;itous) <HI>let them</HI> (if they be able) <HI>relieve them: and let not the</HI> CHURCH <HI>be charged,</HI> (put to unnece&s;&s;ary Expence in that Regard) <HI>That it may relieve them that are Widows</HI> INDEED, i. e. as in <HI>ver.</HI> 5. Widows that are De&s;olate, truly de&s;titute, not only poor and un|able to provide for them&s;elves, but without Friends or Relatives able to help them.</P>
<P>Now as it's thus a Duty incumbent on Church-Socie|ties <HI>(as &s;uch)</HI> to relieve the Poor, &s;o 'tis highly expe|dient for the better performing of this Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Duty, that they do not leave the Affair at a loo&s;e Rate, but man|age it in &s;ome way of Method and Order; and therefore that (pur&s;uant to the primitive Pattern) they <HI>look out from among them&s;elves</HI> &s;ome particular Per&s;ons, Men of &s;uitable Qualifications, <HI>whom we may appoint over
<PB N="16" REF="003421_0018_0FF83BF307591698">
this Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;erving Tables;</HI> who &s;hall make it their Work to &s;earch out the poor Saints, and if need be report to the Church the Occca&s;ions for Charity, and &s;tir them up to their Duty; &s;hall receive the Church's Alms, and faithfully di&s;tribute the &s;ame, as may be&s;t an&s;wer the Ends of Chri&s;tian Charity. So then it is a true Saying, <HI>If a Man de&s;ire the Office of a</HI> Deacon, <HI>he de&s;ires a good Work;</HI> good and profitable unto Men, and not of little Impor|tance to the Churches of the Saints.</P>
<P>And thus I have &s;hewn that the fundamental <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> of the In&s;titution of Deacons being &s;uch as have an A&s;pect upon all Ages, and remain even unto this Day, by ju&s;t Con&s;equence the Office ought &s;till to be acknowledged and &s;upported.</P>
<P>But, before I proceed to my next Argument, it may gratify &s;ome to take Notice of another Objection again&s;t the Nece&s;&s;ity of a di&s;tinct Order of Deacons, for Works of Charity, <HI>Viz.</HI> That however the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> being in <HI>itinerant</HI> Circum&s;tances, might need &s;uch <HI>Helps,</HI> in mi|ni&s;tring to the Saints; yet now the Mini&s;ters of the Word are in a <HI>quiet, &s;etled</HI> State, they can do the Work as well <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> without &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tants &mdash;. To which it is &s;ufficient to reply, That the&s;e <HI>Helps</HI> were de&s;ign'd not for the Relief of the Apo&s;tles only, but of all Teachers of the Word, tho' fixed in particular Charges: and therefore are &s;poken of as found in Churches, that had fixed Pa&s;tors, and Go&s;pel-Order fully e&s;tabli&s;h'd in them. Be&s;ides, had the Apo&s;tles looked on it their proper Province to take Care of the Poor (otherwi&s;e than as in Common with all Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors, by way of Charity) what need was there when they wanted <HI>Helps,</HI> in &s;erving of Tables, to take the&s;e from among the <HI>Laity</HI> or Populace; &s;ince there was &s;uch an abundant Supply of <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> in that day of In&s;piration! Suppo&s;ing the Apo&s;tles itinerant un&s;ettled Condition might very much hinder <HI>them</HI> from per&s;onally performing this good Work; yet &s;ince there was a Plenty of other Mini&s;ters, in that Day, why &s;hould any of the Fraternity be cho&s;en to this Work, and have one (&s;uppo&s;ed) Branch of the Apo&s;tolick Office formally &s;eated in them; and not rather &s;ome in the Mini&s;try be appointed to attend &amp; a&s;&s;i&s;t the Apo&s;tles!&mdash;So that the <HI>Objection</HI> &s;eems to hold equally again&s;t the <HI>fir&s;t In&s;titution,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="003421_0019_0FF83BF511C52220">
as the Propagation and Continuance of the <HI>Office of a Deacon,</HI> con&s;ider'd in Di&s;tinction from the Mini&s;try of the Word.</P>
<P>But I will offer two Hints further here, <HI>Viz.</HI> That <HI>all</HI> Mini&s;ters of the Word &s;eem to have the &s;ame general Objection, as the Apo&s;tles, lying again&s;t their concerning them&s;elves with the Deacons Bu&s;ine&s;s, at lea&s;t &s;o far as it may be any Burden or Impediment to them: and may ju&s;tly &s;ay, as in <HI>Acts</HI> 6. <HI>It is not Rea&s;on that we &s;hould leave the Word of God, and &s;erve Tables&mdash;.</HI> And then, altho' there be not exactly the &s;ame Service, and an equal degree of Care &amp; Labour for Deacons to attend in the&s;e Days, as when they were fir&s;t in&s;tituted; yet this will not ju&s;tify the throwing Contempt on a Divine Appoint|ment, as if it were therefore altogether needle&s;s. Let it be con&s;ider'd (what the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.) <HI>The Body is not one Member, but many. And the Eye can|not &s;ay unto the Hand, I have no need of thee; nor again even the Head to the Feet, I have no need of you. Nay, tho&s;e Members of the Body, which &s;eem to be more feeble, are nece&s;&s;ary. Now ye are the Body of Chri&s;t, and Mem|bers in particular. And God hath &s;et &s;ome in the Church,</HI> HELPS; and not Teachers only.</P>
<P>But I proceed to ob&s;erve&mdash;,</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Qualifications</HI> requir'd of a Deacon, are in their Nature <HI>ordinary</HI> or common; and imply nothing peculiar to the Apo&s;tolic Age, that &s;hou'd argue the Office to be temporary.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, if the Deacons Qualifications had been al|together <HI>extraordinary,</HI> and &s;uch as were confin'd to the Times of In&s;piration, it wou'd have afforded a pro|bable Argument, that the Office was not intended for any longer Continuance: And (as hinted before) the <HI>Cea&s;ing</HI> of tho&s;e Supernatural Gifts and Powers might be ju&s;tly look'd on as in Effect a <HI>Repeal</HI> of the In&s;titu|tion. But the Ca&s;e is manife&s;tly far otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>For, as the Nature of the Office does not tell us there was any <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> for extraordinary in&s;pir'd Gifts, to qualify Men for it; &s;o neither do I apprehend, the Qua|lifications laid down by the Apo&s;tle in our <HI>Context,</HI> are
<PB N="18" REF="003421_0020_0FF83BF69CC5AD48">
any more than common Attainments; whether the Character he gives of approv'd Deacons, be con&s;ider'd in its intellectual or moral view. The Furniture here re|quir'd to make Per&s;ons meet Recipients of this Office, con&s;i&s;ts of the&s;e Particulars; namely, <HI>Gravity, Sincerity, Temperance, Genero&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Openne&s;s of heart, Soundne&s;s in the Faith, and a pure Con&s;cience&punc;</HI> and if in the married State, being <HI>agreeably Match'd,</HI> exerci&s;ing <HI>conjugal Fide|lity, good Parental Government, and a Care of Family-Order;</HI> and in the general, a <HI>blamele&s;s Life.</HI> Now the&s;e are the Fruit of the Spirit in his common and ordinary Influences, and imply nothing of extraordinary and &s;pecial In&s;piration.</P>
<P>Indeed, whereas in the De&s;cription of the Men to be cho&s;en into this Office at its original In&s;titution, be&s;ides that it's required they be Men of <HI>hone&s;t Report</HI> &amp; good <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> 'tis one Requi&s;ite mention'd, that they be <HI>full of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> &s;ome are of Opinion, this re&s;pects the <HI>extraordinary</HI> Gifts of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Now, if this &s;hou'd be <HI>conceded</HI> to, yet the Want of the&s;e miraculous Gifts is no more a ju&s;t argument a|gain&s;t the Continuance of the Deacons Office, than it is again&s;t a &s;tanding Order of Teachers; &s;ince the&s;e Gifts were in tho&s;e primitive Times at lea&s;t equally requi&s;ite to the Office of publick Teachers. Neverthele&s;s in the Ca&s;e of Teachers, this Defect is not allow'd to pa&s;s for a &s;ufficient Objection again&s;t the Continuance of <HI>their</HI> Office: and therefore it is notorious Partiality to plead it again&s;t the Continuance of the Order of Deacons.</P>
<P>But then I &s;ee no Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Conce&s;&s;ion; be|cau&s;e this being <HI>full of the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> may with equal Rea&s;on be under&s;tood of the <HI>Graces</HI> of the Spirit, and particularly tho&s;e of Chri&s;tian Courage, Faith, Hope and Joy: &s;ince the Phra&s;e is el&s;ewhere u&s;ed in this com|mon Sen&s;e.

of Chri&s;t. So it's &s;aid of <HI>Peter,</HI> Act. 4.8. <HI>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;aid, Ye Rulers,</HI> &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> follows, Ver. 13. <HI>Now when they &s;aw the Boldne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ter and John, and perceived they were unlearned and ignorant Men</HI> (by Education) <HI>they marvelled.</HI> We read al&s;o in <HI>Ver.</HI> 31. <HI>They were all filled with the holy Gho&s;t, and they &s;pake the Word of God with Boldne&s;s.</HI> It follows, in Ver. 52. <HI>And the Di&s;ciples were filled with Joy, and with the holy Gho&s;t:</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Texts may &s;erve to explain the Qualification requir'd of Deacons, that they be <HI>full of the holy Gho&s;t;</HI> i. e. They &s;hould be not only &s;uch as have expe|rienced the Renewing of the holy Gho&s;t, but who have the Graces of the Spirit appearing in them with &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing Lu&s;tre; Men full of Faith &amp; Love, &amp; Hope, and holy Zeal, bold in their God to profe&s;s the Go&s;pel, to adhere con&s;tantly to the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, to attend and a&s;&s;i&s;t his Mini&s;ters, and cheerfully to &s;uccour his Poor, in the mid&s;t of all Temptations, Oppo&s;itions and Di&s;couragements: Which is a Character remarkably &s;uted to the Circum&s;tances of primitive Times; but not una|greable to the mo&s;t &s;etled and pro&s;perous State of Things in the Church of God.</P>
<P>It is always requi&s;ite, that the Officers of the Church, whether Elders or Deacons, &s;hould be Men <HI>full of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> in his ordinary Gifts, Graces and Comforts.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the pre&s;crib'd <HI>Qualifications</HI> for the Deacons Office imply nothing in their Nature extra|ordinary, or peculiar to the Apo&s;tolick Age. And this is one ju&s;t Ground of Pre&s;umption, that it was intended for a longer Duration, and to be perpetuated among Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>But I come now to the concluding Argument,&mdash;</P>
<P N="4">4. The Spirit of God has given expre&s;s <HI>Orders</HI> and <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> unto the Mini&s;ters and Churches of Chri&s;t, to govern them in the <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Appointment</HI> of this particular Church Officer; which are of indi&s;pen&s;able univer&s;al Obligation: And con&s;equently the In&s;titution mu&s;t be de&s;ign'd for a perpetual Sub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>There are certain Rules given by a Divinely in&s;pir'd Apo&s;tle, <HI>long after the primitive In&s;titution,</HI> and that
<PB N="20" REF="003421_0022_0FF83BFB0BAD5970">
without any particular Reference to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> or Limi|tation to the <HI>fir&s;t Ages</HI> of the Go&s;pel, relating to the Choice &amp; Con&s;titution of <HI>Deacons:</HI> Which Rules are on Scripture-Record, and to be entertain'd as Apo&s;tolick Canons, indi&s;putably authentick, of univer&s;al Concern|ment, and of la&s;ting Force and Obligation; as much as any other Precepts or In&s;titutes in the &s;acred Context.</P>
<P>The&s;e Epi&s;tles of <HI>Paul</HI> to his Son <HI>Timothy,</HI> he wrote as an Apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by the Commandment of God our Saviour, with a &s;pecial View to the in|&s;tructing him <HI>how he ought to behave him&s;elf in the Church of God;</HI> particularly in the Affairs of Divine Wor&s;hip, Preaching, Di&s;cipline and Ordination. The Coun&s;els and Charges given to <HI>Timothy,</HI> under the&s;e &s;everal Heads, were never yet by any Expo&s;itors (that I know of) look'd upon as merely <HI>Per&s;onal,</HI> or ter|minating in him alone: but have always been con&s;i|der'd and made u&s;e of, as having a general A&s;pect, and applicable by parity of Rea&s;on, to others &s;u&s;taining the Mini&s;terial Character, in every &s;ucceeding Age. They truly exhibit to us a noble Plan of Go&s;pel-Order, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t fully in&s;tructive as to Church-Officers. Particularly in this third Chapter of his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, the in&s;pir'd Doctor of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> gives us di&s;tinctly the Qualifications, fir&s;t of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and then of <HI>Deacons.</HI> Now his Directions under the former Head have ever been receiv'd, as of &s;tanding U&s;e and immutable Obligation: And why the Directions in the latter Ca&s;e &s;hou'd not be allow'd the &s;ame Con&s;ideration, I cannot &s;ee any Shadow of Argu|ment.</P>
<P>Surely that Word, <HI>Let them u&s;e the Office of a Dea|con, being fir&s;t proved,</HI> is a &s;acred Injunction, that re|&s;pects all future Ages; and &s;o is a loud Te&s;timony to the perpetual Continuance of the In&s;titution: For it implies a <HI>Command</HI> that &s;ome <HI>&s;hall</HI> u&s;e this Office, and be &s;epa|rated to it. This &s;hews that the Apo&s;tles (&amp; they cou'd not be mi&s;taken) were beyond all Controver&s;y of Opinion, that the Deacons Office was to continue in the Church. Why el&s;e &s;hould they not only ordain &s;ome unto it them&s;elves; but leave a &s;tanding Rule for the ordaining of others &s;till? This &s;hews the Office is not left <HI>Di&s;cre|tional.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="003421_0023_0FF83BFD8D9DDED0">And when the Apo&s;tle, after giving the proper Di|rections for the chu&s;ing and appointing of Bi&s;hops and Deacons, pre&s;ently adds, <HI>The&s;e things write I unto thee, &mdash; that thou may&s;t know how thou oughte&s;t to be|have thy &s;elf in the hou&s;e of God;</HI> as it looks back to what he had &s;aid in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> &s;o likewi&s;e to what he had &s;poken in Reference to <HI>Deacons.</HI> And as he did not confine his Views to the &s;ingle Per|&s;on of <HI>Timothy,</HI> in his Directions under the former Head, &s;o neither under the latter: but de&s;ign'd the Rules he gave to be of permanent Force and U&s;e in both Ca&s;es thro' every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Age.

<P>Upon the whole, to &s;um up what has been argu'd: <HI>Since</HI> the Office of a Deacon is evidently of a <HI>Divine</HI> Original; <HI>Since</HI> the primitive In&s;titution remains uncan|cel'd, &amp; without any <HI>Repeal,</HI> direct or indirect; <HI>Since</HI> the general <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of it ever continues, and the proper <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> and the <HI>Qualifications</HI> of this Order were no|thing peculiar to the fir&s;t Times of the Go&s;pel; And <HI>&s;ince</HI> there are Apo&s;tolick <HI>Canons</HI> directing to the Choice and Appointment of this Officer in the Churches of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as well as <HI>Jews,</HI> which Rules are to be un|der&s;tood as retaining &s;till their complete Virtue &amp; Effi|cacy, &amp; not to be rejected as either originally Superfluous, or now out of Date: &mdash; from the&s;e Reflections, taken in a conjunct View, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult, by the clear|e&s;t and mo&s;t rational Deduction, that the Office of Deacons was not a Thing temporary in its fir&s;t Intention, and limited to the Days of the Apo&s;tles, but de&s;ign'd for an interminable Continuance, and to be upheld in
<PB N="22" REF="003421_0024_0FF83C004F0A3070">
the Churches thro' all following Times, to the End of the World.</P>
<P>Accordingly now let us <HI>acknowledge</HI> and <HI>honour this Office,</HI> as under a Divine Sanction, and carrying the ve|nerable Stamp of an Apo&s;tolick Con&s;titution. Let us take a &s;utable Notice of the Authority of Chri&s;t in the primitive Appointment: and beware how we reflect on his Wi&s;dom therein, by pleading for the Abolition or Di&s;continuance of it. We may ob&s;erve, when the A|po&s;tles fir&s;t propos'd the Setting up of this Office, it's reported, (Act. 6.5. <HI>The &s;aying plea&s;ed the whole Mul|titude.</HI> And &s;hall it not be plea&s;ing al&s;o to us, to have it continu'd in the Church!</P>

<P>Further, &s;uch as are <HI>called to</HI> this Office in the Church at any time, &s;hou'd take Heed how they throw Con|tempt on a Divine In&s;titution, in <HI>&s;hifting it off</HI> by tri|fling Excu&s;es, and <HI>undervaluing</HI> it as an inferiour Station.</P>
<P>In fine, Let &s;uch as are <HI>engag'd</HI> in this Office among us, con&s;ider <HI>from whence</HI> they derive their Commi&s;&s;ion, and <HI>to whom</HI> they mu&s;t give an Account of their Ste|ward&s;hip, even the Lord JESUS CHRIST, their Ma&s;ter that is in Heaven: &mdash; Which Reflections will have an excellent Influence, by the Grace of God, to direct and animate them in all their pious and charitable Mini&s;tra|tions, Cares and Attendences.</P>
<P>But thus much for the fir&s;t Doctrine. I have been carry'd out, in the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this Argument, to a Length abundantly beyond my Pro&s;pect or Intention when I enter'd on the Subject: and am therefore oblig'd to reduce what I have to &s;ay on the Heads remaining, to a &s;horter Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>We proceed now to another Ob&s;ervation. &mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="003421_0025_0FF83C030DBCBD28">DOCT. II. <HI>Per&s;ons are to be fir&s;t</HI> Prov'd, <HI>and then to u&s;e this Office of a Deacon, being found blamele&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This is the expre&s;s Letter of the Text. Now the Word <GAP DESC="foreign"> implies both Probation and Appro|bation. Agreably I &s;hall &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. There mu&s;t be a <HI>Probation</HI> or Trial of Per&s;ons Qualifications, previous to their Admi&s;&s;ion into this Office.</P>
<P>If Church-Members are to be fir&s;t prov'd, much more Church-Officers. To what End are their proper Qualifications &s;tated in Scripture, if without any Regard to them Elections may be made at all Adventures! Certainly the Rules of common Prudence require, that &s;uch a publick Tru&s;t be not repos'd in any, till they be fir&s;t prov'd, whether they have competent Abilities for the Di&s;charge of it, and po&s;&s;e&s;s that good Character, which may &s;peak them worthy of the Confidence that mu&s;t be put in &s;uch as are admitted this Office. To appoint Men over this Bu&s;ine&s;s, without examining whether they have the requi&s;ite Fitne&s;s for it, wou'd be &s;inful Ra&s;hne&s;s: Which the Holy Gho&s;t enters that &s;o|lemn Caution again&s;t, 1 Tim. 5.22. <HI>Lay hands &s;ud|denly on no Man;</HI> whether for the Office of a Bi&s;hop, or a Deacon.

<P>I &s;hall here offer only this one Remark further; That the Trial intended by the Apo&s;tle &s;eems to be <HI>antecedent</HI> to Mens u&s;ing the Office, and means a &s;erious impartial comparing their Abilities, Tempers and De|portments, <Q>with the <HI>Characters</HI> of one meet for &s;uch an Office, which he had before laid down.

<P><PB N="24" REF="003421_0026_0FF83C04F3A3B618">The Apo&s;tle here requires, that upon Examination they be <HI>found blamele&s;s,</HI> before they be admitted to u&s;e the Office.

<Q><P>As to the Ca&s;e of the &s;even Deacons (&s;ays he) they were left to the Inquiry, Choice, and Nomina|tion of the <HI>Brethren,</HI> there is no Doubt of it. &mdash; 'Tis plain, the Apo&s;tles referring the Nomination of them to the <HI>Brethren</HI> was upon that &s;ingle Score of finding out Per&s;ons <HI>They</HI> wou'd entru&s;t with the Con|tributions of the Church, for the <HI>Daily Mini&s;trations,</HI> and for the <HI>&s;erving of Tables:</HI> For that was the <HI>only thing</HI> in open Agitation, and the holy Apo&s;tles a&s;&s;ign'd that &s;pecial Part to them: <HI>Look you out Men</HI> &amp;c. <HI>whom we may appoint over this Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>

<P>I will add then I think we have here a plain <HI>Pre|cedent for the People's Right of Suffrages in Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Affairs;</HI> and &s;uch as <HI>goes far towards e&s;tabli&s;h|ing a &s;tanding Right and Authority in all Chri&s;tian Congregations, to choo&s;e their own</HI> Officers <HI>for them&s;elves,</HI> and be&s;ure the <HI>Deacons</HI> at lea&s;t.

<P>Yet, ina&s;much as it lies with the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> to <HI>ordain,</HI> This of Con&s;equence nece&s;&s;arily draws with it a Power in them of judging and con&s;enting. So that the Elders have a &s;econdary Right in this Affair: and the ju&s;t Or|der of proceeding demands, that the Church's Election of Per&s;ons to any Office be confirm'd by the Approbation of the Elder&s;hip, if any there is in Being among them!</P>
<P>It may be added,</P>
<P N="3">3. This Approbation is to be follow'd with a <HI>publick Separation</HI> of the Per&s;ons unto their Office; which in|deed is a <HI>practical</HI> Approbation.</P>

<P>DOCT. III. This Con&s;ideration, that <HI>&s;uch as have u&s;ed the Office of a Deacon well, do purcha&s;e to them|&s;elves a good Degree,</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; is what affords Encourage|ment both to an <HI>Engaging</HI> in this Office, and the <HI>Or|daining</HI> of meet Per&s;ons unto it.</P>
<P>This is agreable to the Tenour and De&s;ign of our Text. The Apo&s;tle having given that Direction, <HI>Let the&s;e al&s;o fir&s;t be proved; then let them u&s;e the Office of a Deacon:</HI> pre&s;ently &s;ubjoyns, by way of Argument to enforce the preceeding Direction, FOR <HI>they that have u&s;ed the Office of a Deacon well, purcha&s;e to them&s;elves a good Degree,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. I thought di&s;tinctly to have con&s;idered the DUTY of Per&s;ons in the <HI>Deacon's Office;</HI> and to have &s;hown what is imply'd in <HI>u&s;ing</HI> the &s;ame <HI>well.</HI></P>
<P>But the Time will permit me only a few Hints.</P>
<P>In general, if they would u&s;e their Office well, they mu&s;t in all their Admini&s;trations con&s;tantly make the <HI>Word</HI> of Chri&s;t their governing <HI>Rule,</HI> and his <HI>Glory</HI> their prevailing <HI>De&s;ign;</HI> what&s;oever they do, doing all <HI>in the Name of Chri&s;t,</HI> who&s;e Stewards they are, to re|ceive, keep, and di&s;po&s;e of his Goods.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t act in their Office with <HI>Sincerity:</HI> as the Servants of Chri&s;t, doing the Will of God from the Heart; having their Souls engaged in doing Service, as to the Lord, and not to Men. That's u&s;ually apply'd to Deacons, Rom. 12.8. <HI>He that giveth, let him do it with Simplicity.</HI></P>
<P>They mu&s;t act in their Office with <HI>Integrity</HI> and <HI>Fidelity:</HI> exerci&s;ing all the Powers of their Office, and attending to all the parts of Duty incumbent upon them, with Con&s;tancy, Care and Zeal; and applying the public Monies, to tho&s;e Evangelical Ends, for which they were given, without Fraud, or needle&s;s Delay. They &s;hould be like tho&s;e, of whom we are told, Neh. 13.13. <HI>They were counted faithful, and their Office was to di&s;tribute unto their Brethren.</HI> Agreably the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, 1 Cor. 4.2. <HI>It is required in Stewards, that a Man be found faithful.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003421_0031_0FF83C102C955C50">In order to Faithfulne&s;s, it &s;hou'd &s;eem, <HI>Diligence</HI> is requi&s;ite: and this the Apo&s;tle commends in one, whom the Church employ'd in mini&s;tring to the Saints, 2 Cor. 8 22. <HI>Our Brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent;</HI> &mdash; Suppo&s;e, in collecting Charities, and di&s;tributing of them.</P>
<P>Moreover, They mu&s;t act in their Office with <HI>Pru|dence.</HI> All publick Offices are more or le&s;s attended with Difficulty, and peculiarly expo&s;e to Cen&s;ure. They, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;erve Tables, had Need be <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> as well as faithful Stewards, if they would u&s;e their Office well; <HI>Avoiding this that no Man blame them.</HI> Agreably 'twas one of the fundamental Requi&s;ites in the Character of the primitive Deacons, Act. 6.3. <HI>Full of Wi&s;dom.</HI> They mu&s;t be wi&s;e, to &s;hun all appearances of Evil, and provide Things Hone&s;t in the fight of all Men. They mu&s;t be wi&s;e, to e&s;py and improve all Ad|vantages for promoting the good Ends of their pious and charitable Function. They mu&s;t labour to be un|der&s;tanding in the Times, knowing of Men and Things; and prudently endeavour, by per&s;onal Applications, to put others upon doing their Duty, in giving proporti|onably to u&s;es of Piety and Charity. They mu&s;t wi&s;ely conduct them&s;elves in regard of the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the Word, who&s;e Tables are one proper part of their pious Care; that the Labourer, who is <HI>worthy of his Hire,</HI> be not defrauded and di&s;courag'd. They mu&s;t al&s;o con|&s;ider the <HI>Poor;</HI> watching for &s;utable Occa&s;ions of Cha|rity, making the rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;tinctions between one Ca&s;e and another, timing well and adju&s;t|ing their Di&s;tributions to the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Saints, and labouring to manage all their Affairs with due Thought and <HI>Di&s;cretion.</HI></P>
<P>Further, if they would u&s;e their Office well, they mu&s;t do nothing by <HI>Partiality:</HI> but &s;erve the Tables committed to their Care in the mo&s;t equal manner, with|out a carnal and unju&s;t <HI>preferring one before another.</HI> An Apprehen&s;ion of this criminal Partiality in the daily Mini&s;tration, while under the Apo&s;tles Management, was the Rea&s;on of the <HI>Grecians</HI> murmuring again&s;t the <HI>Hebrews:</HI> and this Emergence was the immediate
<PB N="30" REF="003421_0032_0FF83C12C23ABD60">
Occa&s;ion of &s;etting up the Office of Deacons; as the be&s;t Method to &s;uppre&s;s the pre&s;ent Jealou&s;ies, and provide for an equal and &s;atisfactory Mini&s;tration for the future.</P>
<P>Again, They mu&s;t act in their Office with a <HI>willing</HI> and <HI>generous</HI> Mind. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.8. <HI>He that &s;heweth Mercy,</HI> let him do it <HI>with chearfulne&s;s.</HI> They mu&s;t put on Bowels of Mercy; be pitiful, be courteous, open-hearted; and give, not grudgingly, but with a tender Sympathy of Spirit and Liberality of Hand. They mu&s;t deal out the Alms of the Church, <HI>as a matter of Bounty, and not of Covetou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;.</HI> Be&s;ure they mu&s;t take heed they be not govern'd by <HI>Selfi&s;h</HI> Re&s;pects, nor u&s;e their Office for a Cloak of Covetou&s;ne&s;s. As they mu&s;t not be Prodigals, <HI>given to much Wine,</HI> and wa&s;ting their Lord's Goods in riotous Living: So neither Mi&s;ers, <HI>given to filthy Lucre,</HI> and having Hearts exerci&s;ed with covetous Practices. It was the Sin of <HI>Judas,</HI> who had the Bag, and bare what was put therein, that while he pretended to care for the Poor, he was a <HI>Thief,</HI> and his Heart went after his Co|vetou&s;ne&s;s. It's eminently a Scandal in <HI>Deacons,</HI> and loudly contradicts the Ends of their Office, to &s;hew a narrow niggardly, &s;elf-&s;eeking Di&s;po&s;ition. They &s;hou'd <HI>above all things put on Charity;</HI> that Charity, which is <HI>kind,</HI> which <HI>envieth not,</HI> which <HI>&s;eeketh not her own:</HI> but is the Principle of a noble Self-denial, Bountifulne&s;s, and Largene&s;s of Heart. However &s;till their Liberality mu&s;t be guided by Prudence, and guarded by wi&s;e and ju&s;t Limitations. Frugality and Genero&s;ity &s;hou'd appear with a happy mixture in all their Managements.</P>
<P>It may be added,</P>
<P>They &s;hou'd endeavour to conduct all their charitable Admini&s;trations <HI>after a godly &s;ort;</HI> and will do well to accompany their Vi&s;its and Reliefs to the Bodies of Men, with &s;ome pious Advices for the good of their <HI>Souls;</HI> the common Duty of Chri&s;tian <HI>Brethren;</HI> according to that of the Apo&s;tle, (1 The&s;s. 5.14.) <HI>Warn the unruly, com|fort the feeble-minded, &s;upport the weak.</HI> And they will do well &s;ometimes, as there may be Occa&s;ion, al&s;o to <HI>help together by Prayer.</HI> Thus they will &s;hew them|&s;elves <HI>full of all Goodne&s;s,</HI> and &s;ignalize their Character as HELPS to the Mini&s;try. And thus the Poor will ex|perience a <HI>double Charity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="003421_0033_0FF83C144D5861C0">Yet it mu&s;t be &s;ubjoyned here;</P>
<P>They that wou'd u&s;e the Office of a Deacon well, mu&s;t keep within the proper <HI>Limits</HI> of their Station, and not &s;tretch them&s;elves beyond their Line, to invade the peculiar Province of Bi&s;hops or Pa&s;tors of the Church. The <HI>&s;erving of Tables,</HI> the outward Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e of GOD, was the bu&s;ine&s;s over which the primitive Dea|cons were appointed, by in&s;pir'd <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> who thought it not <HI>Rea&s;on that Mini&s;ters &s;hou'd leave the Word, to &s;erve Tables:</HI> Herein manife&s;tly putting a Di&s;tinction be|tween the&s;e two, as Offices widely different, and incom|patible to one and the &s;ame Per&s;on, as to the &s;tated Ex|exci&s;e of them. Some indeed think, the <HI>Seven</HI> were Preachers of the Go&s;pel: But that's very improbable, from the whole Tenour of the &s;acred Story, and from this particular Con&s;ideration, That they mu&s;t <HI>leave the Word,</HI> if they undertook to <HI>&s;erve Tables:</HI> which was a thing they cou'd not in <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> do; as being under the &s;ame Obligations with the Apo&s;tles, to <HI>give them&s;elves continually to the Word and Prayer&mdash;.</HI> As to what we read afterwards concerning <HI>Two</HI> of the Seven, neither can any Argument be collected from thence to &s;upport the Pretences of baptizing and preaching Deacons. <HI>"Stephen</HI> only <HI>di&s;putes</HI> in the Schools; and <HI>pleads,</HI> when accus'd, at the Bar". His Apology appears merely occa&s;ional, and becoming any Chri&s;tian Confe&s;&s;or. As for <HI>Philip</HI> indeed we find him preaching &amp; baptizing: yet not as a Deacon, but as an <HI>Evangeli&s;t.</HI> This Title is expre&s;ly given him, <HI>Acts</HI> 21.8. Now the Work of an Evangeli&s;t was not to <HI>&s;erve Tables,</HI> but to <HI>preach the Word:</HI> and whereas the Deacon was a fixed <HI>Re&s;ident,</HI> the Evangeli&s;t was an un&s;etled <HI>Itinerant.</HI> Hence we have ju&s;t Grounds to conclude that when <HI>Philip</HI> was call'd to be a Preacher, he put off the Deacon, as incon|&s;i&s;tent. Be&s;ure, attending on the <HI>daily</HI> Mini&s;tration at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> cou'd not very well con&s;i&s;t with his going abroad to preach the Go&s;pel. The occa&s;ion of <HI>Philip</HI>'s going forth to this Work, and quitting his Station at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;eems to be the great Per&s;ecution, that aro&s;e upon <HI>Stephen's</HI> Death; whereby the Church there was broken up and &s;cattered abroad. THEN Philip <HI>went down to</HI> Samaria, <HI>and preached Chri&s;t unto them,</HI> Act. 8.5.
<PB N="32" REF="003421_0034_0FF83C160FA537F0">
And from thenceforth he gave him&s;elf to the Work of an Evangeli&s;t; being either ordained to it by the Apo&s;tles, or immediately call'd by the Holy Gho&s;t &mdash;. There's nothing then of an Example in <HI>Philip</HI> or <HI>Stephen,</HI> to countenance <HI>Deacons</HI> in publick <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Baptizing,</HI> by vertue of their <HI>Diaconal</HI> Ordination. But in doing either, they mu&s;t certainly tran&s;gre&s;s the ju&s;t Bounds of their Office; the original De&s;ign of which evidently was to &s;erve Tables, in Contradi&s;tinction to the Mini&s;try of the Word.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add,</P>
<P>Tho&s;e in the Deacons Office, that wou'd u&s;e it well, mu&s;t &s;tudy to adorn their Character, by a &s;hining <HI>Ex|ample</HI> of good Works, and of a &s;ober, di&s;creet, and u&s;eful Conver&s;ation. <HI>Likewi&s;e the Deacons mu&s;t be grave,</HI> &amp;c. As Church-Officers, they are in a di&s;tingui&s;h'd Po&s;t: and &s;hould make it their Care to &s;et a laudable Pattern of Temperance, Solidity, Probity, Purity, Charity and Devotion; that others &s;eeing their good Works, may glorify GOD, by admiring the Grace of Chri&s;t be&s;towed upon them, and by imitating their bright Example.</P>
<P>Thus I've &s;hown how they mu&s;t behave, if they wou'd u&s;e their Office well. And let it now be briefly &s;ug|ge&s;ted.</P>
<P N="2">2. If they thus u&s;e their Office well, <HI>they purcha&s;e to them&s;elves a good Degree</HI> and great Boldne&s;s in the Faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Upon this I find a Variety of Glo&s;&s;es made by Expo&s;itors.</P>
<P>By a <HI>good Degree,</HI> there are that under&s;tand a <HI>Seat</HI> of &s;ome Eminence in the publick A&s;&s;embly. But this &s;eems too low a Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>Others &s;ay, it means, they acquire to them&s;elves a good Degree <HI>above the Vulgar;</HI> a good &s;tanding in the Church, whereby they may boldly admini&s;ter their Office, and bear &s;ome Authority and Influence.</P>
<P>Others again interpret it; They are in a hopeful way towards Preferment, and acquire to them&s;elves a ju&s;t Title thereto. <HI>Philip</HI> is an In&s;tance of this Advance|ment. Some think, anciently the Pa&s;tors were often elected from among the Deacons: That they were a kind of Seminary or Nur&s;ery, out of which the Church was for the mo&s;t part furni&s;h'd with meet Per&s;ons for the
<PB N="33" REF="003421_0035_0FF83C1893F0D008">
Mini&s;try of the Word; that they having in their lower Station given &s;ufficient Evidence of their Orthodoxy, Piety &amp; Prudence, &amp; gain'd &s;ome Experience in Chri&s;tia|nity, were reckon'd the proper Candidates for pro|motion to the Pa&s;toral Care.</P>
<P>In fine, By purcha&s;ing to them&s;elves a good Degree may be intended their acquiring a <HI>valuable Reputation,</HI> E&s;teem and Honour among the People of GOD; which gives them &s;ingular Advantages to be u&s;eful, and &s;erves to embolden them in a&s;&s;erting and promoting the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t. <HI>Stephen</HI> (one of the fir&s;t Deacons) was the very fir&s;t Martyr, and brought great Glory to Chri&s;t and the Go&s;pel by his Boldne&s;s in the Faith. So he purcha&s;|ed to him&s;elf a good Degree, and his Memory is Ble&s;&s;ed. It may be added, Such obtain Honour from GOD in a better World, di&s;tingui&s;hing Rewards in the Church Triumphant.</P>
<P>But it remains to &s;ay, &mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The&s;e Con&s;iderations are ju&s;t Incentives unto the Churches and Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, to elect &amp; &s;eparate meet Per&s;ons to the</HI> Deacons <HI>Office, and unto &s;uch to</HI> engage <HI>in it, and be careful to</HI> u&s;e it well.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle might have all the&s;e Views, in our Text.</P>
<P>He de&s;ign'd to pre&s;s on <HI>Timothy</HI> (and in him on all &s;ucceeding Mini&s;ters) a Care to promote the Settlement of this Officer in the Churches every where, and to &s;ee to it that only Per&s;ons of an approv'd Character were admitted thereto. <HI>Let the&s;e be fir&s;t proved; then let them u&s;e the Office of a Deacon, being found blamele&s;s:</HI> &mdash; FOR <HI>they that u&s;e the Office of a Deacon well, do purcha&s;e to them&s;elves a good Degree.</HI></P>
<P>He might herein al&s;o intend to lay matter of En|couragement before the <HI>Churches,</HI> to proceed to the Choice of &s;uch Officers among them, where they were wanting, and to continue and honour the Office where it was already &s;et up.</P>
<P>In a word, He might have this further View (&s;eeing 'tis the natural Tendency of what he has &s;aid) to offer a Motive unto &s;uch as &s;hould be cho&s;en, to accept of
<PB N="34" REF="003421_0036_0FF83C1C979FFD28">
a Call to this Office; neither afraid of it as above them, nor &s;hy of it as beneath them: and to continue therein with all Fidelity, and Care to u&s;e their Office well; with|out which they wou'd purcha&s;e to them&s;elves Shame and Reproach, rather than a good Degree. The&s;e, I think, lie plainly in the Text as collateral or con&s;equential Truths, natively falling in with the Scope of the A|po&s;tle, without any Stretch upon the Words.</P>
<P>But I have no Room for any Enlargement on the&s;e Things, and therefore &s;hall now draw to a Clo&s;e, with &s;omething by way of APPLICATION.</P>
<P>And here, &mdash;</P>

<P>Let it be your &s;olicitous Care to <HI>u&s;e your Office well,</HI> acting therein with Sincerity, Faithfulne&s;s, Diligence, Con&s;tancy; and labouring to conduct all your Affairs with Prudence, according to the Wi&s;dom that God giveth you.

<P>There's a particular Dignity in your Office: and your wi&s;e Deportment therein will reflect a Lu&s;tre on your &s;elves. The ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Angels</HI> delight in this honorable Employ, to mini&s;ter unto the Saints that are in the Earth: Which &s;erves to magnify your Office. &mdash; Let it be your Ambition to imitate tho&s;e generous and noble Spirits, in being zealous of good Works, ready to do all kind &amp; chri&s;tian Offices that lie in your Power, as there may be Occa&s;ion: being Eyes to the Blind, and Feet to the Lame, and Fathers to the Poor; cau&s;ing the Widows Heart to &s;ing for Joy: &s;o the Ble&s;&s;ing of them that are ready to peri&s;h, will come upon you. This Angelick Temper of Soul, di&s;playing it &s;elf in your cha|ritable Mini&s;tration, will &s;pread a Glory upon your Cha|racter, and make you &s;hine in the Eyes of God, Angels, and Men. The Ear that hears of you, will ble&s;s you: and every Eye, when it &s;ees you, will give Witne&s;s to

you, and be ready to think of holy <HI>Stephen;</HI> concerning whom it is &s;aid, They looking &s;tedfa&s;tly on him, <HI>&s;aw his Face as it had been the face of an Angel.</HI></P>
<P>Let it be a further encouraging Reflection, that the Office you are engag'd in, is what <HI>Chri&s;t has &s;et in his Church:</HI> &mdash; not a mere human Prudential, the Crea|ture of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Policy, but the Re&s;ult of Divine Wi&s;dom, an In&s;titution of Infinite Sovereignty, In u&s;ing this Office well, you will <HI>&s;erve the Lord Chri&s;t.</HI> He has put you into it, and you may hope for his Pre&s;ence with you in the Di&s;charge of it; who&s;e <HI>Grace is &s;ufficient for you.</HI> Let a &s;en&s;e of this fortify you again&s;t all Di&s;courage|ments. <HI>Faithful is he that hath called you, who al&s;o will do it.</HI></P>
<P>And let the Pro&s;pect of that <HI>Account</HI> you mu&s;t one day give up to Him, who&s;e Stewards you are, make a powerful Impre&s;&s;ion on your Hearts, and have a &s;utable Influence into the univer&s;al Conduct of your Lives. Re|member you are re&s;pon&s;ible to your Lord: and the Time is ha&s;tning on, when He will call you to a Reckoning; will &s;ummon you before him, and require an Account of your Steward&s;hip. Let this be a &s;timulating Motive with you continually unto a Care of all good Fidelity; that when your tran&s;itory Service on Earth is ended, you may with holy <HI>Stephen fall a&s;leep</HI> in Je&s;us, and in the la&s;t Day hear that joyful approving Sentence pronounc'd upon you, WELL DONE, <HI>good and faithful Servant;</HI> Thou <HI>ha&s;t been faithful over a few Things: I will make thee Ruler over many.</HI> Behold, he cometh quickly, and his Reward is with Him. Be you faithful unto the Death, that when He &s;hall appear, you may have Confidence, and not be a&s;hamed before him at his coming. Look to it you u&s;e your Office well; that you may have Boldne&s;s in the Day of Judgment. And you will then be found to have purcha&s;ed to your &s;elves a good Degree indeed. For that glorious Lord, who is very bountiful to tho&s;e which &s;erve him, will then a&s;&s;ign you a dignify'd Station and a di&s;tingui&s;hing Recompence. Then all your own <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Alms, whereby you have oft refre&s;h'd the Bowels of the Saints, and all your <HI>official</HI> Charities, which you have in a &s;ort made your own by a compa&s;&s;ionate and chearful Di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;hall be openly applauded and re|warded.
<PB N="36" REF="003421_0038_0FF83C20A3C7ED68">
It will appear then, how you have made to your&s;elves friends of the Mammon of this World, and laid up in Store a good Foundation again&s;t the time to come.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations &s;hould excite &s;uch as are call'd unto the Office of a Deacon, to engage in it with a ready Mind: and you that are in it to act therein with a holy Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction, to be &s;tedfa&s;t, unmoveable, al|ways abounding in the Work of the Lord; as knowing that GOD is not unrighteous, to forget your Work of Faith, and Labour of Love, &s;hewed to his Name, in mi|ni&s;tring to the Saints.

<P>And we be&s;eech you, Brethren, <HI>Know them which labour among you</HI> in this pious and charitable Office of <HI>&s;erving Tables.</HI> 1 Cor. 16.15 &mdash; <HI>Ye know the Hou&s;e of</HI> Stephanas, <HI>that they have addicted them&s;elves to the Mini&s;try of the Saints; I be&s;eech you, Brethren, that ye &s;ubmit your &s;elves unto &s;uch; &mdash; Acknowledge ye them that are &s;uch.</HI> You owe Honour to the <HI>In&s;titu|tion</HI> of Chri&s;t, by virtue of which they hold Office in the Church: and to them, Re&s;pect and Love for their Work-&s;ake. 'Tis a worthy Mini&s;tration they attend upon. They are u&s;eful Servants of their Generation, while they di&s;charge their Office well; and de&s;erve a particular E&s;teem among the People of GOD.</P>
<P>Will you <HI>remember</HI> them in your Addre&s;&s;es to the Throne of Grace! They are at their Ordination recom|mended to GOD by &s;olemn Prayer: and methinks they &s;hou'd not afterwards be forgotten in your Interce&s;&s;ions. Sure I am, they de&s;ire your affectionate Remembrance of them.</P>
<P>And let me al&s;o commend it to you, that a ju&s;t <HI>Care</HI> be taken at all times, to enable them to an&s;wer the Ends of their Office, by <HI>filling their Hands</HI> for a Di&s;tri|bution to charitable and pious U&s;es.</P>
<P>This Officer &s;tands in the Hou&s;e of GOD a con&s;tant <HI>Monitor</HI> to the A&s;&s;embly, of their Duty to <HI>honour the Lord with their Sub&s;tance.</HI> And the Church, that elect him, do hereby practically contract with him, that they
<PB N="37" REF="003421_0039_0FF83C2237CD56E0">
will own him in the Execution of his Office, find him &s;utable Employment in his Station, and &s;upply him (as they are able) for a liberal Di&s;tribution to the Nece&s;|&s;ities of Saints. I can't but look on it a gro&s;s Incongru|ity (not to &s;ay, a trifling Formality and Mockery of a Divine In&s;titution) to put Men, by a &s;olemn Church-Vote in the Name of God, under the Character of <HI>Dea|cons,</HI> and yet not <HI>appoint them over their proper Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,</HI> nor take the nece&s;&s;ary Methods to furni&s;h them for an <HI>u&s;ing their Office well.</HI>&mdash; Whether a Church-Stock be of <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> Con&s;equence in the affair of a <HI>Deacon's</HI> Call, and "of the vital Con&s;titution of his Function", as &s;ome think, I &s;hall not now &s;tand to di&s;pute. How|ever I freely &s;hew my Opinion, that it's the incumbent Duty of every Church-Society to endeavour, by one wi&s;e Method and another, the rai&s;ing and pre&s;erving among them &s;omething of a FUND, for charitable, pious, and evangelic De&s;igns; the Relief of the Poor, the Support of the Mini&s;try, and Propagation of Chri&s;tianity. Every one <HI>zealous of good Works,</HI> I think, cannot but highly approve and wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to &s;uch a Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>And if the Churches did their Duty, <HI>concerning the Collection for the Saints, every one contributing as God hath pro&s;per'd them;</HI> there would be a Sufficiency of Work for the Officers, that Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted to <HI>&s;erve Tables.</HI> None methinks cou'd then with any Colour of Rea&s;on &s;cruple the Propriety of a &s;olemn Ordination of them. And as for them, how wou'd it encourage their Hearts, to &s;ee the Churches they re&s;|pectively &s;erve, taking a proper Care, that they may be <HI>thorowly furni&s;hed unto all good Works,</HI> for the Hou&s;e of their God, and for the Offices thereof! How <HI>gladly</HI> wou'd they receive the Gift, and take upon them the Fellow&s;hip of the mini&s;tring unto the Saints! When they &s;ee you with a perfect heart <HI>offering willingly</HI> to the Lord, as a matter of <HI>Bounty,</HI> and not of Covetou&s;|ne&s;s, their Souls will ble&s;s you: Yea, and the Lord your God will ble&s;s you; He will &s;mell in the &s;olemn A&s;&s;em|bly the &s;weet Odour of your Offerings, and will cau&s;e his Ble&s;&s;ing to re&s;t in your Hou&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="003421_0040_0FF83C24D6B3DFD8">Put on therefore, as the Elect of God, holy and beloved, <HI>Bowels of Mercies, Kindne&s;s,</HI> &mdash; and <HI>Charity,</HI> which is the bond of Perfection. Let <HI>brotherly Love</HI> continue and abound more and more. Be not forgetful to <HI>entertain Strangers.</HI> Remember them which are in <HI>Bonds,</HI> as bound with them, and tho&s;e that &s;uffer <HI>Ad|ver&s;ity,</HI> as being your &s;elves al&s;o in the Body. Remem|ber likewi&s;e them which <HI>have the Rule over you</HI> (&s;o the Apo&s;tle exhorts) and let him that is taught in the Word, communicate to him that teacheth, in all good things. <HI>Be not deceived: God is not mocked &mdash;.</HI> Let your Conver&s;ation be <HI>without Covetou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> for we have here no continuing City: and as you wou'd evidence your truly &s;eeking one to come, &mdash; to <HI>do Good,</HI> and <HI>to communicate</HI> (unto all the mentioned purpo&s;es) <HI>for|get not.</HI> For with &s;uch Sacrifices <HI>God is well plea&s;ed:</HI> and what you lend to the Lord, <HI>He will repay</HI> with glorious Increa&s;e; very probable in this World, but mo&s;t certainly and mo&s;t perfectly in the next.</P>
<P>I conclude now with two remarkable Texts: one in the Old Te&s;tament, the other in the New. Mal. 3.10. <HI>Bring ye all the tithes into the &s;tore-hou&s;e, that there may be meat in mine Hou&s;e, and prove me now here|with, &s;aith the</HI> LORD <HI>of ho&s;ts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a ble&s;&s;ing, that there &s;hall not be room enough to receive it.</HI> And 2 Cor. 9.8 &mdash; 12. <HI>God is able to make all grace abound towards you; that ye always having all &s;uffi|ciency in all things, may abound to every good work: (As it is written, He hath di&s;per&s;ed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteou&s;ne&s;s remaineth for ever. Now he that mini&s;treth &s;eed to the &s;ower, both mini&s;ter bread for your food, and multiply your &s;eed &s;own, and increa&s;e the fruits of your righteou&s;ne&s;s) Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulne&s;s, which cau&s;eth through us thanksgiving to God.</HI></P>
