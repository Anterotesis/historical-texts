<OPENER><SALUTE>Candid READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>THESE SERMONS</HI> were preached to my own Congregation, without any De&s;ign of making them pub|lic; but was induced hereto, as follows: In <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, I received a Letter from the <HI>COLLEGE</HI> of <HI>NEW-JERSEY,</HI> in|forming me of an extraordinary Appearance of the divine <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> there, and reque&s;ting I would come and &s;ee; with this kind Motion I gladly complied, and having been there &s;ome Time, had all the Evidence of the Reallity of the afore&s;aid Report, which
<PB N="iv" REF="008266_0003_102DDD772703A3F0">
could be in Rea&s;on de&s;ired. Of this my dear Brother <HI>WILLIAM</HI> writes thus, <Q>I went to the College la&s;t <HI>Monday,</HI> and &s;aw a me|morable Di&s;play of God's Power and Grace in the <HI>Conviction</HI> of <HI>Sinners,</HI> the whole Hou&s;e was a <HI>BOCHIM;</HI> a Sen&s;e of God's Holine&s;s was &s;o impre&s;&s;ed on the Hearts of its Inhabitants, that all of them, excepting <HI>two</HI> (e&s;teemed religious) were greatly &s;haken re&s;pecting the <HI>State</HI> of their <HI>Souls.</HI> This <HI>gracious Ray</HI> reached the <HI>LATIN SCHOOL,</HI> and much affected the <HI>MASTER,</HI> and a Number of the <HI>SCHOLARS;</HI> nor was it con|fined to the Students, &s;ome others were like|wi&s;e awakened: I di&s;cour&s;ed with all the pre&s;ent Members of the College (excepting one) who generally <HI>enquired</HI> with <HI>Sollici|tude, what they &s;hould do to be &s;aved;</HI> nor did I ever &s;ee any, in that Ca&s;e, who had more clear Views of <HI>GOD</HI> and <HI>them|&s;elves,</HI> or in any Hou&s;e, more genuine Sor|row for Sin, and Longing for <HI>JESUS;</HI> this ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Work</HI> of the <HI>MOST HIGH,</HI> &s;o far exceeded my Expectation, that I was lo&s;t in Surprize, and con&s;trained to &s;ay, is it &s;o, can it be &s;o? Nor was my being, Eye and Ear witne&s;s from <HI>Monday</HI> to <HI>Friday,</HI> able to recover me from my A&s;toni&s;hment! I felt, as the Apo&s;tles, when it was told them the Lord had ri&s;en, they could not believe, through

Fear and great Joy! My Reverend Bre|thren, and Self, were like tho&s;e that dream: The Lord hath done great Things for us, whereof we are glad <HI>(P&s;. 126.)</HI> This re|ligious Concern was not begun by the ordi|nary Mean of Preaching, or promoted by any alarming Methods, yet &s;ome were ready to &s;ink under its Weight; it &s;pread like the increa&s;ing Light of the Morning, a wi&s;e and gracious Providence, had brought about a Concurrence of different Incidents, which tended to engage them to Thoughtfulne&s;s about their Souls <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Incidents</HI> (refered to by my Brother) were e&s;pe|cially the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Several <HI>Letters</HI> re&s;pecting the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Excellency</HI> of <HI>internal Religion,</HI> &s;ent to &s;ome of the <HI>Students,</HI> with practical <HI>Books</HI> of like Tendency: The <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> of one of the <HI>Scholars,</HI> in the <HI>College;</HI> his being <HI>awakened</HI> out of Security, at that Time, and &s;peaking to others; together with other Students <HI>&s;peaking</HI> to tho&s;e about them concerning divine Things.</NOTE>; the&s;e Things, viewed in Con|nection, manife&s;t the Finger of God. The <HI>Freene&s;s</HI> of who&s;e Grace appears by con&s;i|dering, that a little before this merciful Vi&s;itation, &s;ome of the Youth had given a greater Loo&s;e to their <HI>Corruptions,</HI> than was common among them; a Spirit of <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Contention</HI> prevailed, to the great Grief, and almo&s;t Di&s;couragement of the worthy <HI>PRESIDENT.</HI> There was little or

no Motion of the Pa&s;&s;ions in the Preachers, during their public Performances, nor any public Di&s;cour&s;es in the Hours alotted for Study, only at Morning and Evening Pray|ers, &s;ome plain and brief &s;criptural Exhort|ations and Directions (proper to Per&s;ons under &s;piritual Trouble) were delivered: Before I came away, &s;everal Per&s;ons received &s;ome Thing like the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Adoption;</HI> being tenderly affected with a Sen&s;e of <HI>re|deeming Love,</HI> and thereby determined to endeavour after univer&s;al <HI>Holine&s;s.</HI> I can|not fully repre&s;ent this <HI>glorious Work,</HI> it will bear your mo&s;t enlarged Apprehen&s;ions of <HI>a Day of Grace;</HI> let God have all the Glory!

<P><HI>THE</HI> hearer of <HI>Prayer,</HI> excited di|vers Members of that Society to vehement <HI>Wre&s;tlings,</HI> for an <HI>Effu&s;ion</HI> of <HI>&s;acred Influ|ence</HI> on the <HI>Students,</HI> that hereby they might be prepared, as <HI>poli&s;hed Shafts,</HI> to promote, with all the <HI>Ardor</HI> of their Souls, the truly noble Intere&s;ts of the <HI>Redeemer's Kingdom:</HI> This <HI>believing Importunity</HI> did not continue long, before <HI>Jehovah</HI> rent the Heavens, and came down, and brought <HI>Salvation</HI> with him to that <HI>Hou&s;e:</HI> This <HI>Prodigy</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> excited high

<Q><BIBL><HI>GEN. 1.27.</HI></BIBL>
<P>God created Man in his own Image.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HERE is an Account of the Creation of Man, in which three Particulars are remarka|ble, <HI>viz.</HI> The Time, Author, and Manner. And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, AS to the <HI>Time,</HI> it was on the Sixth Day after the other Creatures were made, then Man was formed, to be as it were the <HI>End</HI> and <HI>Compend</HI> of them; in him God de&s;igned peculiarly to manife&s;t the Glory of his Wi&s;dom, Mercy, and Ju&s;tice: There was a Sort of a Climax or Gradation in the Works of Creation, from Things le&s;s perfect, to Things more &s;o; Man, the no|ble&s;t
<PB N="xxii" REF="008266_0021_102E51026AFCD260">
Creature of this lower World, was made la&s;t, that the Glory of God, appear|ing in his other Works, might be declared by him, who was fitted for that De&s;ign: He was made when all Things were pre|pared for his Entertainment and Delight, that &s;o he might be the more induced to celebrate the divine Prai&s;e, for &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hing a Benefit. But,</P>
<P N="2">2d, THE <HI>Author</HI> of his Creation, was the holy <HI>Trinity,</HI> Three in One, and One in Three; <HI>and God &s;aid let us make Man.</HI> The Word <HI>&s;aid,</HI> being in the &s;ingular Number, &s;hews the Unity of God's E&s;&s;ence, and the Word God<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Elohim.</NOTE>, being in the Plural, &s;hews a Plurality of Per&s;ons in the Godhead. But,</P>
<P N="3">3d, THE <HI>Manner</HI> of Man's <HI>Creation</HI> was, 1&s;t, With <HI>Council; let us make Man.</HI> The Narrative of this is introduced, with a ma|nife&s;t Di&s;tinction from the Re&s;t of the Creation Works: Hitherto only a Word of <HI>Command</HI> had been given for producing the other Works; <HI>and God &s;aid, let there be Light, and there was Light,</HI> &amp;c. But now a Council is called, when Man is to be formed; who, under GOD, was the Scope of the Re&s;t. Some pretend, that God &s;peaks here, after the Manner of <HI>Princes,</HI> in the plural Number, who u&s;e to &s;ay, we will, and require, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But hereto it may
<PB N="xxiii" REF="008266_0022_102E5103F0CEB870">
be replied, that this is only the Invention and Practice of latter Times, and no ways agrees with the Simplicity of the fir&s;t Ages, or the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> The Kings of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> u&s;ed to &s;peak of them&s;elves in the &s;ingular Number, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.28. and el&s;e|where, and &s;o did the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Monarchs too; <HI>Ezra</HI> 6.8. <HI>I, Darius, make a Decree. Ezra</HI> 7.21. <HI>I, even I, Artaxerexes, the King, do make a Decree.</HI> It is therefore unrea&s;onable to thru&s;t the U&s;ages of modern Stile, into the &s;acred Scriptures: Be&s;ides the Lord doth generally &s;peak of him&s;elf in the &s;ingular Number, &s;ome few Places excepted, which are de&s;igned to &s;ignify the My&s;tery of the Trinity; as particularly, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.22. <HI>The Lord &s;aid, the Man is be|come as one of us;</HI> which &s;hews that there are more Per&s;ons than one in the Godhead. Man was to be a Creature, different from all that had been hitherto made, Fle&s;h and Spirit, Heaven and Earth, mu&s;t be united in him: He mu&s;t be allied to both Worlds, and therefore the Almighty (as it were) calls a Council to the making of him; to repre&s;ent to us his &s;uperior Excellency, as well as the Care of God concerning him.</P>
<P>AND, 2d, Man was made in God's <HI>Image, and after his Likene&s;s;</HI> the&s;e two Words import the &s;ame Thing (<HI>Gen.</HI> 5.3.) and
<PB N="xxiv" REF="008266_0023_102E510575BF1050">
repre&s;ent to us the exact Likene&s;s to God that was in Man originally; he was certain|ly a nearer Re&s;emblance, than any other of the vi&s;ible Creatures, but yet there ever was, and ever will be, an infinite Di&s;tance between God and him, in re&s;pect of Dignity and Excellency, CHRIST only <HI>is the expre&s;s Image of the Father's Per&s;on,</HI> being of the &s;ame <HI>Nature</HI> with him: Man is God's Image only, as the Shadow in the Gla&s;s, or the King's Impre&s;s upon the Coin. Now the Image of God in Man, was Three-fold, <HI>viz.</HI> Natural, Moral, Political. And 1&s;t, The <HI>natural Image</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in Man, con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Faculties</HI> of the <HI>Soul:</HI> The Nature of the Soul was and &s;till is Spiritual, Simple, Invi&s;ible, Immortal, which Properties, do in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, re&s;emble the Spirituallity, Simplicity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the &s;upream Being: Be&s;ides, the Facul|ties of the Soul, <HI>viz.</HI> Under&s;tanding, Will, and active Power, do re&s;emble the Mind, Will, and Power of God; add to this, that a Variety of Faculties in one and the &s;ame Soul, &s;eem to &s;hadow forth a Plurality of Per&s;ons in the divine E&s;&s;ence; &s;o that the Soul, con&s;idered in the afore&s;aid Faculties, is, perhaps, the brighte&s;t Looking-Gla&s;s in Nature, wherein we may, in &s;ome Sort, behold God.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="xxv" REF="008266_0024_102E5108106B27D0">2d, The <HI>political Image</HI> of <HI>God</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in that <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Government</HI> over the lower Creation which God gave to innocent Man; <HI>and let them have Domi|nion over the Fi&s;h of the Sea, and over the Fowls of the Air, and over all the Earth, and over every creeping Thing that creepeth on the Earth.</HI> The Almighty made innocent Man his <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> upon Earth; he gave him Authority to u&s;e the inferior Creatures for his Support and Comfort, and to receive Homage from them: An Evidence of this was their coming to him, and receiving Names from him as their Lord. Now the Foundation of this <HI>Dominion,</HI> was the free Gift of God the Creator, as appears from the Words before recited, the rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of which is manife&s;t from the Super|eminence of Man's Nature to the other Creatures over which he was to pre&s;ide; it was fit that that which was le&s;s perfect, &s;hould &s;ubmit to that which was more per|fect. And the Mean by which this Do|minion was brought to pa&s;s, was the Pro|vidence of God, by which all the Creatures had a Faculty and Inclination to obey Man: And doubtle&s;s, the End was God's Glory, that as Man had received all from God, &s;o he &s;hould refer all the Homage and Ser|vice he got from the Creatures to him.

over the Creatures &s;ubjected to him: And his <HI>Affections</HI> were <HI>regular,</HI> free from inor|dinate Appetite, ready to obey the Conduct of his Mind; his Thoughts were free from Vanity, and ea&s;ily fixed upon the be&s;t Ob|jects; thus beautiful and harmonious was the original State of Man!</P>

<P>IT is a very ab&s;urd and dangerous Opi|nion, which &s;ome entertain, from the Abu&s;e of that Pa&s;&s;age of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> where we are &s;aid to be <HI>Partakers of the divine Nature;</HI> that Original Righteou&s;ne&s;s, con|&s;i&s;ted in Man's having a Part of the divine Being; for, as this &s;uppo&s;es the Almighty to be divi&s;ible, &s;o it makes Man equal to his Maker, both which are bla&s;phemous; all therefore that is intended by the Phra&s;e, is that good People do partake of holy Di&s;|po&s;itions, re&s;embling the moral Excellen|cies of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> but it &s;hould be &s;till re|membered, that all the Perfections of Crea|tures, are finite, dependant, variable;&mdash; whereas tho&s;e of God, are independant, invariable, infinite.</P>
<P>THE Scriptures po&s;itively declare, that Man was made originally <HI>upright, Ecle&s;.</HI> 7.29. Yea <HI>good,</HI> very <HI>good, Gen.</HI> 1.31.

But how could this be, if he wanted Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and Holine&s;s?

<P>THE Body of Man being formed, it plea&s;ed God to infu&s;e into it an immortal <HI>Soul (Gen.</HI> 2.7.) which as to its <HI>Nature,</HI> is an immaterial, incompleat Sub&s;tance, en|dowed with Under&s;tanding and Will, which by its Union with the Body, is the Cau&s;e of a three-fold Life to Man.

<HI>immaterial,</HI> which is evident from its Ope|rations, it perceives immaterial Things, and that after an immaterial Manner, by com|paring one Thing with another, and infer|ing one Thing from another. 3d, It is <HI>incompleat,</HI> in re&s;pect of its being ordained for, and <HI>di&s;po&s;ed</HI> to a <HI>Union</HI> with the <HI>Body,</HI> as a Part of the Compound; by which, it differs from the Being of <HI>Angels.</HI> 4th, It is endowed with certain Faculties of Un|der&s;tanding and Will, by which it perceives what is true, and embraces what is good. 5th, By its <HI>Union</HI> with the <HI>Body,</HI> it is the in&s;trumental Cau&s;e of that manifold <HI>Life</HI> which Man lives, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t, <HI>Vegetative;</HI> by which we are nouri&s;hed, grow, and pro|pogate our Kind. 2d, <HI>Sen&s;itive;</HI> by which we di&s;cern and judge of &s;en&s;ible Things, by the Help of the Five outward Sen&s;es, Hearing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as well as of the three inward, <HI>viz.</HI> Common Sen&s;e, Fancy, and Memory. 3d, <HI>Rational;</HI> by which we di&s;cern &s;pi|ritual Objects, and are able to rea&s;on about them.

&s;peaks? <HI>A.</HI> It was that actual Sin, which our fir&s;t Parents committed by eating the forbidden Fruit, and the Guilt thereof which are charged upon <HI>Adam</HI>'s Po&s;terity, becau&s;e the Prohibition did not re&s;pect him only, but them al&s;o whom he repre&s;ented; this is commonly called original Sin imputed; to|gether with the Polution con&s;equent there|upon, con&s;i&s;ting in a want of original Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and Propen&s;ity to all Evil; this has &s;tained the whole human Nature, as both Scripture and &s;ad Experience witne&s;s, and from this fatal Fountain all actual Evils flow; this Polution or Depravity, is com|monly called Original Sin inherent.</P>

<P>NOW &s;urely the Puni&s;hment could not pa&s;s upon all, without the Cau&s;e thereof, the Sin together with it; for the Judge of all the Earth mu&s;t needs do right: And hence we may learn, that Original Sin is propagated after the &s;ame Manner, that Death is, <HI>viz.</HI> by natural Generation; Men are begotten &s;inful, and &s;o by con&s;equence mortal, for by Sin came Death.</P>

<P>THIS apo&s;tolical Conclu&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>by the Offence of one, Judgment has come upon all Men to Condemnation,</HI> or, in other Words, that the Guilt of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin is imputed to all his Offspring, is the important Point, that I would e&s;&s;ay to evince in this Di&s;cour&s;e, by Scripture and Rea&s;on, and to an&s;wer Ob|jections to the contrary; but previous there|to, give me Leave to offer &s;ome Con&s;idera|tions, that tend to ca&s;t Light upon the la|bouring Subject.</P>

<P>BUT what is SIN? I an&s;wer in the Words of the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> that it is <HI>a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law,</HI> or a being without the Law, or not conformed to it; the&s;e Things the original Word <HI>anomia,</HI> &s;ignifies.</P>
<P>A LAW in general may be thus de|&s;cribed, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is a Rule of Things to be done, and avoided, enacted by compe|tent Authority, and enforced by the Sanc|tion of Rewards and Puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>THE Law of GOD in this, differs from the Laws of &s;ecular Princes, that it pre|&s;cribes Limits to the Temper and Acts of the Mind, as well as to the Speech and overt Actions of the Life: For the Mind is the Man, the internal Principles that Men act from, as well as their Views and Frames in acting, are indeed the chief Things that con&s;titute the Goodne&s;s or Badne&s;s of Action; and they being all open to the Eye of God, it is but right, that the Father of Spirits (from whom the Law proceeds) the ju&s;t Judge of the Univer&s;e&punc; &s;hould pre&s;cribe Rules for, take Cognizance of, and reward or puni&s;h them according to

their different Natures, and Degrees of Goodne&s;s or Malignity: But earthly Poten|tates having no Knowledge of the Heart, or Empire over it, are utterly di&s;qualified for &s;o arduous a Province; and the Inten|tion of civil Laws being only to pre&s;erve external Order and Right in the State, if the&s;e Things be ob&s;erved, its End is an|&s;wered: But it is not &s;o in Re&s;pect of the Laws of GOD, there the Spring and Scope of Action, which are concealed from, and impenetrable to human Cognizance, are principally regarded; there the lea&s;t Di&s;con|formity in the Temper of the Soul, or in any of its Acts, Di&s;po&s;itions, and De&s;igns, to that perfect and univer&s;al Purity the Law requires of all intelligent Beings, is a Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of the Limits pre&s;cribed by it, and therefore Sin.</P>
<P>THE original right of Power among Men, ari&s;es either from Generation in Nature, Pre&s;ervation in War, or &s;ome public Ser|vice done to Society: Thus the Juri&s;diction and Dominion of <HI>Jehovah</HI> over Mankind, is founded in his Propriety in them, and that ari&s;es from his giving to them their Be|ings, and all their Benefits; <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 44.21. <HI>Remember O</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>for thou art my Servant, I have formed thee.</HI> From hence a &s;upream Right of Legi&s;lation naturally i&s;&s;ues; in a

<P>THE Laws of Religion are of two Kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> moral and po&s;itive; the former are founded in Rea&s;on and Equity, and there|fore are immutable and perpetual; enjoined becau&s;e they are intrin&s;ically Good; but the latter, <HI>viz.</HI> po&s;itive Laws, proceed from God's &s;overeign Plea&s;ure, without regard had to the intrin&s;ic Goodne&s;s and Value of Things, and therefore are good only be|cau&s;e they are enjoined, and alterable by the Authority that enjoined them, being in them&s;elves indifferent: An Example of the former we have in the moral Law, and of the latter, in the Precepts to ab&s;tain
<PB N="11" REF="008266_0047_102E5147CBE28AA0">
from the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.</P>
<P>MAN, at his fir&s;t Creation, was &s;ubject to the Law of Nature; which contains the&s;e Rules or Maxims concerning moral Good and Evil, which have an intrin&s;ic, invari|able Equity in them, and are the Mea&s;ure, Standard, and Scale of the Offices he owes to God, his Neighbour, and him&s;elf: This Law is Holy, as it enjoins an Imitation of tho&s;e divine Attributes, which are the Source and Pattern of Purity; Ju&s;t, as it re|quires us to give to every one his Due, and, Good, as it recommends Charity and Bene|ficence, and is profitable to the Ob&s;erver of it; for in keeping this Law, there is a great Reward, even in this Life.</P>
<P>TO the Law of Nature, was annexed the po&s;itive Precept to ab&s;tain from eating the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, for im|portant Rea&s;ons, <HI>viz.</HI> to manife&s;t God's Sovereignty, and to try the Creature's Obe|dience.</P>
<P>JEHOVAH being the Almighty Creator, is of Con&s;equence the ab&s;olute Proprietor, and Sovereign Lord of all; and therefore Man could have but a &s;econdary right of U&s;e to his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, founded on the di|vine Beneficence, and limited by his Plea|&s;ure; for which he is obliged to render

Homage: As Princes when they give E&s;tates to their Subjects, &s;till retain the Royalty, and receive a &s;mall Rent, which though incon&s;iderable in it&s;elf, perhaps but a Barley Corn, is neverthele&s;s an Acknow|ledgment of their Sovereignty, and of the Tenants Dependance on them: Thus it was in regard of the Tree of Knowledge, ab&s;taining from the Fruit thereof, was a Token of Man's Subjection to, and Depend|ance on his great and glorious Sovereign; nor could any Thing be better adapted to try Obedience, than the Prohibition of what was in it&s;elf indifferent, and only became unlawful by the Creator's Plea&s;ure: For in this View the Precept had no other Excel|lency to recommend it, but the Authority or Will of God, and therefore to ab&s;tain was pure Obedience to divine Sovereignty, without any Motive from the intrin&s;ic Ex|cellency of the Things enjoined, whereby the Creature's natural Liberty was re&s;trained.</P>
<P>THIS Law of Nature being in a great Degree effaced by the Sin of Man, a new Edition was given of it upon Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> on Tables of Stone, wrote by the Finger of GOD him&s;elf, which is called the moral Law, becau&s;e it pre&s;cribes Rules for the Conduct of Life, or Regulation of Mens Manners, and likewi&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h it from

<P>FOR the COVENANT being mutual be|tween GOD and Man, as it gave an A&s;&s;u|rance of the reward to coroberate his Faith, &s;o it was the &s;ure&s;t Bond to pre&s;erve his Fi|dility: It is true, the Precept alone binds by the Authority that impo&s;es it, but the Con&s;ent of the Creature increa&s;es and en|dears the Obligation!</P>
<P>THE Almighty might have demanded the Creature's Obedience to his Sovereign Plea&s;ure, meerly by way of ab&s;olute Em|pire; but he was plea&s;ed to deal with Man in a more conde&s;cending, engaging Man|ner, by u&s;ing &s;uch Arguments to enforce his Authority, as were adapted to Influence his Rea&s;on and Ingenuity, his Fear and Love!</P>
<P>NOW the Terms of the fir&s;t Covenant, my Brethren, are rational, for they e&s;tabli&s;h an in&s;eparable Connection between Sin and Ruin expre&s;ly, and between Duty and Happine&s;s implicitly, as appears by the

<P>AND indeed it is highly rea&s;onable, that eternal Death &s;hould be the Wages of Sin, con&s;idering it oppo&s;es all the immen&s;e Per|fections of the Deity, and violates all the innumerable, endearing and infinite Obli|gations we are laid under to &s;erve him, by

<P N="1">1. UNBELIEF, or Di&s;tru&s;t of GOD, who had &s;aid, that if they Eat of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, they &s;hould &s;urely die; the Truth of which Declaration they que&s;tioned, and &s;o <HI>made God a Liar,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> ob&s;erves, 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.16. &s;hock|ing Bla&s;phemy!

<P N="9">9. IN the Sin of our fir&s;t Parents are contained, perfidious BREACH of COVE|NANT, and devili&s;h APOSTACY; they had but lately entered into Covenant with the Divine Maje&s;ty, and promi&s;ed to &s;erve him, and ab&s;tain from the forbidden Fruit; but behold in an In&s;tant, and on a &s;light Oc|ca&s;ion, they break Friend&s;hip with GOD, revolt from his Allegiance, and con&s;pire

<P>IT appears with the cleare&s;t Light and Evidence, from the following Ver&s;es, that what I have &s;aid is the Apo&s;tle's Scope and Meaning; &s;ee Ver&s;es 16, 18, 19. <HI>For the Judgment was by one to Condemnation, but the free Gift is of many Offences to Ju&s;tifi|cation; therefore as by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemna|tion, even &s;o by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free Gift came upon all to Ju&s;tification of Life; for as by one Man's Di&s;obedience many were made Sinners, &s;o by the Obedience of one, &s;hall many be made Righteous;</HI> what can be expre&s;&s;ed in plainer and &s;tronger Terms than this Truth in the&s;e Ver&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> that we are after the &s;ame Manner condemned by the Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> as we are ju&s;tified by

<P>THE Antithe&s;is between CHRIST and <HI>Adam</HI> will not hold, if <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin be not imputed to us; for as the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is &s;o imputed to Believers, that every one of them may &s;ay truly it is his own; and hence Chri&s;t is called by the Prophet, <HI>the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and is &s;aid by the Apo&s;tle, to be <HI>made of God to us, Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification, and Redemption;</HI> &s;o every Child of <HI>Adam</HI> may &s;orrowfully &s;ay, re&s;pecting his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that Iniquity is mine, and I am righteou&s;ly puni&s;hed for it.</P>
<P>NEITHER is there any Thing unrea&s;o|nable in the Doctrine of the Imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin to his Po&s;terity, if it be con|&s;idered, that he had a Capacity to keep the Covenant made with him; and that the Con&s;equences of his doing &s;o, which were equal to the Lo&s;s that he and his Offspring &s;uffered by his Fall, would have been as certainly conferred upon them, as if they were per&s;onally obedient.</P>

<P>ANOTHER Objection is this, <HI>viz.</HI> that our Lord told his Di&s;ciples, <HI>That neither the blind Man, or his Parents, had &s;inned, but that the Works of God &s;hould be made ma|nife&s;t in him (Joh.</HI> 9.23.)</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> THE Meaning of the Place, is no more than this, that the Almighty did not inflict that Di&s;order of Blindne&s;s upon the Man, as a Puni&s;hment of any particular Evil committed by him, or his private Pa|rents; but chiefly with de&s;ign to manife&s;t his own Power in the Cure of it.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="008266_0075_102E5195315DE8B0">BUT it is farther objected, that the Im|putation of Original Sin, is contrary to the Ju&s;tice and Truth of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> IT is contrary to Ju&s;tice, to puni&s;h him that has &s;inned in no re&s;pect, either actually or virtually, but it is not unju&s;t to puni&s;h tho&s;e that have &s;inned virtually only, or in their Cau&s;e, as we have in <HI>Adam;</HI> the Ca&s;e is certainly &s;o, that GOD does puni&s;h for that Evil now; and from Fact we may argue to Right, re&s;pecting the Almighty; for &s;urely he does nothing but what he has a Right to do; add to this, what has been &s;aid before, concerning the rea&s;onablene&s;s of <HI>Adam</HI>'s being made a Repre&s;entative of his Po&s;terity, and the Objection vani&s;hes.</P>
<P>FARTHER, the Charge of Inju&s;tice may be with Advantage retorted upon our Op|ponents, who according to their Hypothe|&s;is, are obliged to acknowledge, that the Wages of Sin, <HI>viz.</HI> Death, are inflicted upon &s;uch as are entirely innocent (<HI>viz.</HI> Infants) neither guilty of Original or Actual Sin; a Sentiment very har&s;h and &s;evere, and manife&s;tly contrary to the Dictates of Rea|&s;on and Maxims of Ju&s;tice: Pray is it not more equitable to believe, that God puni&s;hes for &s;ome Sin, though it be Original, than for none at all? Whether it be mode&s;t and con&s;i&s;tent, for the&s;e Gentlemen to rai&s;e a

Hu-and-cry of Inju&s;tice, again&s;t their Neighbours Opinion, while they are &s;o deep in the Dirt them&s;elves, is left to others to determine.</P>
<P>NEITHER is it contrary to the Omnicience and Truth of GOD, to reckon him to have &s;inned virtually, or interpretatively in his Cau&s;e, who has not &s;inned actually in his own Per&s;on.</P>
<P>IT is again objected, that the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> does not exi&s;t, and therefore that it cannot be imputed.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> ALTHOUGH it does not exi&s;t Phy&s;i|cally, yet it does exi&s;t Morally; though the Act of Sin be tran&s;ient, yet the Guilt it con|tracts is permanent, and cannot be removed but by the Application of Chri&s;t's Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s to the Soul.</P>
<P>NEITHER is the following Objection of any Validity, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is unrea&s;onable that the Sin which was pardoned in <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;hould be imputed to his Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> THOUGH <HI>Adam</HI> per&s;onated us in &s;in|ning, he did not do &s;o in repenting and be|lieving, by which he obtained Remi&s;&s;ion; for the State from which he fell, was na|tural, and therefore involved all, but the State to which he was re&s;tored was gracious, and &s;upernatural, and therefore concerned his own Per&s;on only, and not his Po&s;terity;
<PB N="41" REF="008266_0077_102E51994CD9E2F0">
for though <HI>Adam</HI> was con&s;tituted the Head or Repre&s;entative of his Po&s;terity, in the Covenant of Nature or of Works; yet he was made no Head or Repre&s;entative of the Covenant of Grace, by which he was re&s;tored: No; this was the Place of the &s;econd <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER Objection again&s;t the labour|ing Point is this, that it is not agreeable to the divine Perfections, for the Almighty to appoint <HI>Adam</HI> to be the Repre&s;entative of his Po&s;terity, without their Con&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> SEEING the Plan of the fir&s;t Covenant was in it&s;elf rea&s;onable, and more to our Advantage, than if every Man had &s;tood for him&s;elf per&s;onally, as was ob&s;erved be|fore; there is no Foundation for the Ob|jection, unle&s;s our Opponents &s;ay, that it is unju&s;t for God to confer Benefits upon any without their Con&s;ent, which is ridiculous and ab&s;urd. So proper a Per&s;on as <HI>Adam,</HI> the common Father of all, and con&s;equently the mo&s;t honourable (in the ordinary Way of Generation) of all the human Race, could not be found to repre&s;ent his Po&s;terity, and therefore had all Mankind exi&s;ted, it would have been both their Intere&s;t and Duty, to have cho&s;e him for their Repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>BESIDES it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that the Benefit propo&s;ed to <HI>Adam</HI> in the Cove|nant
<PB N="42" REF="008266_0078_102E519CF4BC03E8">
of Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> a Confirmation of his pre&s;ent State of Happine&s;s, was what he had no natural Right to, antecedent to the divine Will and Plea&s;ure; and therefore JE|HOVAH might without the Charge of In|ju&s;tice &s;u&s;pend the Grant of it, upon a Con|dition to be performed by him, his Failure in which, might cau&s;e a Forfeiture of the Benefit propo&s;ed, both to him and his De|&s;cendants, who cannot be with rea&s;on &s;up|po&s;ed to have a greater Right to it then he.</P>
<P>AND although when our fir&s;t Parents &s;inned, we did not exi&s;t and con&s;ent actu|ally, yet we exi&s;ted and con&s;ented virtually in our Cau&s;e, Progenitor and foederal Head, in one <HI>Adam,</HI> as our Text a&s;&s;erts; <HI>Where|fore as by one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin, and &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, for that all have &s;inned:</HI> But our Opponents mode&s;tly give the Lye to the Apo&s;tle, and the Spirit with which he was in&s;pired, and &s;ay that all have not &s;inned.</P>
<P>I might add, that the Covenant of Na|ture, or of Works, was not INTER PARES, AMONG EQUALS, but between the Almighty Creator, ab&s;olute Proprietor and Sovereign Lord of all, and poor Worms of the Earth, who are but of Ye&s;terday, cru&s;hed before the Moth, and have no abiding; Creatures who&s;e Goodne&s;s extends not to Immen&s;ity

<P>IT is not contrary, my Brethren, to the Law of Nature, or of Nations, for the Children of Traitors to &s;uffer for their Crimes; or for the Iniquity of &s;ome public Per&s;ons, to be puni&s;hed in many others; whole Cities and Countries have &s;uffered on their Account: Was not the Sin of the <HI>Ama|lekites</HI> puni&s;hed in their Children, by the expre&s;s Order of God, &s;ome Hundreds of Years after it was committed?

<P>THOUGH none but the Guilty are puni&s;h|ed for their Parents Sins, yet ina&s;much as the Almighty takes <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> from their Sins to puni&s;h their Po&s;terity (in temporal re&s;pects) it plainly &s;hews, that they are in &s;ome Sort imputed to them; and no won|der, &s;eeing the Child is but as it were a Part of the Parent, cloathed in another Skin; and therefore the Almighty being the original Proprietor, and Lord of all,

<P>NAY even the Things which they them|&s;elves knew, they had not Authority enough to inculcate upon Mens Minds, with &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ion as to Influence and govern their Conduct; the Truths they proved by a Train of &s;peculative Rea&s;onings, were de|&s;titute of more &s;en&s;ible Authority to enforce them with Energy in Practice; the Precepts they propo&s;ed wanted Weight, and evi|dently appeared to be no more than the Precepts of Men; this was doubtle&s;s the Rea&s;on that none of the Philo&s;ophers were ever able to work any remarkable Change in the Minds and Lives of their Hearers; nor does it appear in Hi&s;tory that any of the Followers of SOCRATES, were ever &s;o convinced by his In&s;tructions of the Excel|lency of Virtue, and the Certainty and Va|lue of its final Reward, as to be willing to lay down their Lives for its Sake, as innumera|ble Di&s;ciples of the Lord JESUS CHRIST have done, with the greate&s;t Gladne&s;s and heroic Fortitude.</P>

in a Word, if there was &s;o much Incon|&s;i&s;tency in them&s;elves, as to give Scandal to others, and &s;o much Depravity in others, as to make them de&s;pair of reforming them, then was there plainly a want of &s;ome Re|velation to &s;upply the&s;e Defects, and to di&s;|cover in what Manner and with what Kind of external Service the ble&s;&s;ed God might be acceptably wor&s;hipped; a Revelation to di&s;cover what Expiation he would be plea|&s;ed to accept of for Sin, by which his Ho|nour is affronted and his Authority oppo&s;ed; a Revelation to give intelligent Beings an A&s;&s;urance of the great Motives of Religion, the Rewards and Puni&s;hments of a future State.</P>

<P>THIS conde&s;cending and gracious Inter|po&s;ure, appears evidently in the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem, the Plan of Salvation by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which though it be de&s;pi&s;ed by the Ignorant, Incon&s;iderate, and Preju|diced, is by tho&s;e that are awakened out of their Security, and divinely illuminated, experienced to be indeed and in Truth a glorious Di&s;play of the <HI>Power</HI> of God, and the WISDOM of GOD; the latter of which let us for a little Space fix our Meditations upon at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed God, my Brethren, fore|&s;eeing Man's Fall, and the Mi&s;ery con&s;e|quent upon it, determined his Recovery in a Way worthy of him&s;elf, and &s;uited to the Circum&s;tances of the apo&s;tate Creature, in which his Wi&s;dom is eminently con&s;picu|ous.</P>
<P>THIS will appear by con&s;idering the END that God propo&s;ed, and the MEANS he con|certed to compa&s;s it; all intelligent Agents fir&s;t propo&s;e an End, and then choo&s;e the Means that tend to obtain it; now the more perfect the Under&s;tanding is, the more no|ble

<P>THE END propo&s;ed by the Go&s;pel of the Lord JESUS CHRIST is mo&s;t excellent, <HI>viz.</HI> the GLORY of God, and the Happine&s;s of Mankind, or their Re&s;toration to his Image and Favour.</P>
<P>THE GLORY of GOD, or the Manife&s;ta|tion of his Attributes, by their Exerci&s;e to the moral World, was his &s;upream Scope; as God is the be&s;t of Beings, of Con&s;equence his Glory mu&s;t be the be&s;t End, and there|fore it is but rea&s;onable he &s;hould aim at it in all his Works; and hence he is &s;aid to have made all Things for him&s;elf, and that of him, and through him, and to him are all Things; &s;eeing he is the Creator and Lord of all, it is but ju&s;t and right that he &s;hould be the End of all; nothing can be more natural than that what was borrowed from him, &s;hould be directed to him, or his Honour; <HI>the Heavens</HI> are therefore &s;aid to <HI>declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament to &s;hew forth his Hand Work;</HI> on this Ac|count the Revelation of the Way to future Happine&s;s, by the dear, dear Lord JESUS CHRIST, is called, <HI>The glorious Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God;</HI> becau&s;e it is the cleare&s;t Mani|fe&s;tation, the riche&s;t Di&s;play of the tran|&s;cendant Excellency of his adorable Attri|butes,

which was ever given to the Chil|dren of Men; and hence <HI>Jehovah</HI> is &s;aid to <HI>magnify his Word</HI> (i. e. the Word of his Grace) <HI>above all his Name:</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>the Mini&s;tration of Righteou&s;ne&s;s ex|ceeds in Glory;</HI> and that under this Di&s;pen|&s;ation, <HI>we all, with open Face, beholding as in a Gla&s;s the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame Image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord:</HI> In the Go&s;pel we behold the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the harmonious Manife&s;tation of the divine Attributes in the Scheme of Salvation through him, not under the dark Vail of Types, Shadows, and Prophe&s;ies, as the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church, but with open Face as in a Gla&s;s, and are thereby gradually tran&s;|formed into his Image, through the Holy Spirit's concurring Influence.</P>
<P>TO the afore&s;aid Manife&s;tation of the di|vine Attributes, which the Almighty pro|po&s;ed as his &s;upream End, we mu&s;t add the Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving of rea&s;onable Crea|tures on Account thereof; when intelligent Beings acknowledge the Di&s;plays of God's Excellencies with adoring Reverence, and ardent Affections, they glorify him; <HI>he that offereth prai&s;e, glorifieth me,</HI> &s;aith the Almighty by the P&s;almi&s;t; and this undoubtedly the

<P>BUT the &s;ubordinate End in Redemption, is the Re&s;toration of Man; and this indeed is in&s;eparably connected with the former, as appears from the Angels Anthem, <HI>Glory to God on High, on Earth Peace, and good Will towards Men:</HI> Sin had broke the &s;acred Alliance between God and Man, and ex|po&s;ed him to the divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, an in|expre&s;&s;ible and incomprehen&s;ible Mi&s;ery; now what is more becoming the Father of Mercies, the God of Love, than to compa&s;|&s;ionate and relieve the Mi&s;erable; than to rai&s;e from the Depth of ruin many Monu|ments in which his Kindne&s;s and Benignity might for ever triumph!</P>
<P>TO compa&s;s the&s;e truly valuable ENDS, divine Wi&s;dom projected the apte&s;t MEANS po&s;&s;ible; which appears in the following ea&s;y Light.</P>
<P>THE Mi&s;ery of apo&s;tate Man con&s;i&s;ted in the Deprivation of his whole Nature by Sin, and in his Expo&s;edne&s;s to the divine Di&s;plea|&s;ure on the Account of it, which was a ju&s;t and natural Con&s;equent of his crim&s;on Apo|&s;tacy; and his Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in re|&s;toring him to his original Purity and Fel|low&s;hip with God, and to the full Enjoy|ment of him; but the Way to effect this,
<PB N="64" REF="008266_0101_102E51D556E052C0">
in Con&s;i&s;tency with the divine Ju&s;tice, Law, and Government, was a Depth which no human Under&s;tanding could fathom.</P>
<P>THAT God, who&s;e being is LOVE, &s;hould &s;hew Kindne&s;s to the Angels, who never &s;werved from his Statutes, is ea&s;y to imagine; for though they cannot merit his Favour, yet they never incurred his Di&s;plea&s;ure by Maleconduct; and it mu&s;t needs be natural to <HI>Jehovah,</HI> to Love the Image of his Purity wherever it appears.</P>
<P>NOR is it hard to conceive, that the Al|mighty would be inclined to &s;uccour an in|nocent Creature in Mi&s;ery; for in this Ca&s;e, there would be nothing to ob&s;truct the free Efluxes of his unexhau&s;ted Goodne&s;s; but how to &s;ave a Creature that is as guilty as mi&s;erable by its own criminal Choice, is a Difficulty too hard to be &s;olved by the Wi&s;|dom of Men or Angels. Heaven it&s;elf &s;eemed to be divided on this Occa&s;ion. MERCY inclined to &s;ave, but JUSTICE in|terpo&s;ed for Satisfaction.</P>
<P>MERCY regarded Man with re&s;pect to his Mi&s;ery, and its Pleas were &s;uch as the&s;e, &s;hall the mo&s;t excellent Creature in the lower World peri&s;h, the Fault not being entirely his? peri&s;h for ever, without any Favour!

State, were the Beauty and Crown of all the numerous Ranks of Being in this infe|rior Sy&s;tem; &s;hall the malignant Enemy for ever Triumph in the fatal Succe&s;s of his Perfidy, and reduce the whole human Race to the mo&s;t deplorable and remedile&s;s Ruin? On the other Hand, JUSTICE, the Nature of which is, to give to every one his Due, con&s;idered Man as guilty of a mo&s;t ungrateful, murderous, and pregnant Ini|quity; the Wages of which, agreeable to the Dictates of Rea&s;on, and the Law of God, is DEATH; this divine Attribute re|mon&s;trates again&s;t &s;hewing any Favour to the unhappy Delinquents; and queries, <HI>&s;hall not the Judge of all the Earth do Right?</HI> All the other Attributes &s;eemed to be At|tendants on Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE WISDOM of GOD enforced its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">lea; it being mo&s;t indecent, that Sin, which de|merits the Execution, &s;hould procure the Abrogation of the Law; which would en|courage the Commi&s;&s;ion of it, without Fear.</P>
<P>THE MAJESTY of GOD was likewi&s;e con|cerned; for it was not becoming excellent Greatne&s;s and ab&s;olute Sovereignty, to treat in this humble Manner with Inferiors and Delinquents, and to offer Pardon to pre|&s;umptuous, ungrateful Rebels, before they

<P>THE HOLINESS of GOD confirms and co|roborates the Plea of incen&s;ed, le&s;ed Ma|je&s;ty, and urges Ju&s;tice to execute the Threatning annexed to the Violation of the Law; for <HI>Jehovah is of purer Eyes, than to be|hold Iniquity:</HI> As Purity is the e&s;&s;ential Ob|ject of his complacential Will, which he Loves immutably where ever it is, &s;o by the Law of Contraries, Sin is the eternal Object of his Hatred; and con&s;equently &s;uch as are (with their full Con&s;ent) under its habitual Rule and Government, becau&s;e of their Connection with it, <HI>he will not,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Job, take the wicked by the Hand, or at all acquit them,</HI> as the Prophet <HI>Nahum</HI> expre&s;&s;es it: Purity and Pollution, by rea&s;on of their contrary Natures, cannot mix or coale&s;s, but mu&s;t maintain a perpetual Jar and Di&s;|cord, till one or other is de&s;troyed. Far|ther, SIRS,</P>
<P>THE TRUTH of GOD being plighted in the Covenant of Works, &s;tands engaged to &s;ee to the Execution of the Penalty denounced in Ca&s;e of Tre&s;pa&s;s; and if it is not, the Matter &s;o requiring, divine Truth fails; but that is impo&s;&s;ible, and therefore this Attribute joins i&s;&s;ue in the Conte&s;t with di|vine Ju&s;tice, Wi&s;dom, Maje&s;ty, and Purity,

<P>BUT to proceed, is not the incompre|hen&s;ible My&s;tery of redeeming Wi&s;dom and Grace, well worthy of our &s;erious Thoughts and Study; &s;eeing it excels all other Sciences in the Sublimity of its Object, the Certainty of its Principle, the Efficacy of its Influence, and the Value of its End?</P>
<P>IT is a Doctrine that affects the Soul, with the highe&s;t Admiration of the divine Wi&s;dom, Grace, and Love; and makes us &s;peak in the P&s;almi&s;t's Language, <HI>how won|derful are thy Thoughts to us-ward?</HI> when the Almighty hereby <HI>turns our Captivity, we are as tho&s;e that dream;</HI> this opens be|fore us the grande&s;t Theme, that was ever expo&s;ed to mortal Eye, or Ear; a Com|plication of Wonders, the chief of all the Ways of God; &s;trange that he who fills Heaven and Earth, &s;hould be confined in a Virgin's Womb, that Life &s;hould die, and being dead, revive! that Mercy &s;hould tri|umph, without infringing on the Rights of Ju&s;tice!</P>
<P>THE Principle of this my&s;terious Doctrine is immutable, like God the Author and Object of it; whereas philo&s;ophical Sciences are frequently &s;hifting, almo&s;t every one, through Pride and exce&s;&s;ive Self-love, is

di&s;po&s;ed to de&s;pi&s;e and pull down what ano|ther with much Labour builds up.</P>
<P>AND how precious and powerful is the Influence of this Doctrine, upon tho&s;e that believingly receive it? <HI>while they behold as in a Gla&s;s the Glory of the Lord, they are tran&s;|formed into the &s;ame Image, from Glory to Glory; this is eternal Life to know God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he has &s;ent:</HI> O let us cry earne&s;tly to God, that Chri&s;t crucified, may be more and more the Wi&s;dom of God, and the Power of God to us. <HI>Amen, Amen;</HI> dear Lord JESUS CHRIST, &s;ay, AMEN.</P>

<P>THESE Words contain an important <HI>Intreaty,</HI> in which the following Particulars are contained, <HI>viz.</HI> the AUTHOR, the OBJECT, the MAT|TER, and MODE. The AUTHOR of this Intreaty, is the ever ble&s;&s;ed GOD; he it is who invites Sinners to turn from the Evil of their Ways, his Authority over us is ab&s;o|lute and unque&s;tionable, having made us by his Power, and to him we are under infinite Obligations, in Point of Rea&s;on and Gratitude, becau&s;e of his &s;upream Emi|nence and Perfection, and the innumerable, invaluable, and immerited Benefits we have received from him, among which this IN|TREATY is one, which is calculated to

<P>IN a preceeding Sermon, upon this pre|cious Text, I propo&s;ed to &s;peak upon four Heads, which were the&s;e, 1. To &s;hew what Per&s;ons may attain to in Religion without Conver&s;ion, 2. To Di&s;|cour&s;e of what is ordinarily preparatory to this Change, 3. To <HI>explain</HI> its Nature, and 4. Repre&s;ent its Nece&s;&s;ity: It is only the fir&s;t of the&s;e that has been e&s;&s;ayed; I now proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">2. HEAD of Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> to treat of what is ordinarily PREPARATORY to a gracious CHANGE; and that is a Work of <HI>Conviction by the holy Spirit, through the Law, whereby the Sinner is made to &s;ee the utter Impo&s;&s;ibility of Ju&s;tification, by Obedience to it, and is
<PB N="185" REF="008266_0222_102E53154B660B88">
&s;hut up to Chri&s;t, as the only Door of Hope; I through the Law am dead to the Law,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle Paul, <HI>that I might live unto God;</HI> and el&s;ewhere <HI>the Law</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>our School-Ma&s;ter, to bring us to Chri&s;t, that we may be ju&s;tified by Faith (Gal.</HI> 3.24.) this is effected in the following Manner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Law</HI> being applied by the holy <HI>Spirit</HI> to the Soul, <HI>convinces</HI> of Sin, and hence it is &s;aid, that <HI>by the Law is the Know|ledge of Sin,</HI> and the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> declares of him&s;elf, that <HI>he had not known Sin but by the Law (Rom.</HI> 7.7.) <HI>without the Law,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Sin was dead,</HI> i. e. in my Apprehen&s;ion, for <HI>I was alive without the Law once,</HI> e. g. had a fal&s;e Hope of the Safety of my State, <HI>was alive to the Law,</HI> expected Ju&s;tification by it; but <HI>when the Commandment came, Sin revived, and I died;</HI> when the Law was applied to my Con&s;cience by the Spirit, I had an affecting View of my Sins, and lo&s;t my fal&s;e Hope of Righteou&s;ne&s;s by the Law, and that groundle&s;s Chearfulne&s;s that flowed from it! that the holy Spirit concurs with the Law to this Purpo&s;e, appears from <HI>John</HI> 16.7, 8. <HI>and when he is come, he will re|prove or convince (Elenchei) the World of Sin;</HI> the Law being the Rule of Action, and Sin being a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this Law, it is therefore a fit Mean to convince of Sin,
<PB N="186" REF="008266_0223_102E5316CE8715F0">
yet it is but a Mean, and therefore does it not to Purpo&s;e, till the <HI>holy Spirit</HI> opens it by his Influence, in its &s;piritual Extent to the Mind, and &s;ets it Home upon the Heart. Here ob&s;erve, that the <HI>holy Spirit</HI> (1.) <HI>Convinces</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> in the <HI>Life,</HI> thus it was with <HI>Peter</HI>'s Hearers, while he boldly and faithfully charged upon them, the Cru|cifixion of Chri&s;t, they <HI>were pricked in their Heart (Acts</HI> 2.36, 37.) the Guilt of this Sin was fa&s;tened upon them, but tho' <HI>Con|viction</HI> begins with one Sin, yet it &s;oon di&s;|covers many more, which appear, as tho' ranged in <HI>Battalia,</HI> again&s;t the Sinner; thus it was with the Woman of <HI>Samaria, John</HI> 4.29. <HI>come &s;ee a Man, that told me all Things that ever I did.</HI> (2.) The <HI>holy Spirit con|vinces</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> in the <HI>Heart,</HI> after a Di&s;covery of Sins in the <HI>Life,</HI> he leads the Sinner to behold the corrupt <HI>Fountain,</HI> from which they flow; and indeed the Wickedne&s;s of the Heart is a&s;toni&s;hing and inexpre&s;&s;ible, it exceeds that of the Life, as much as a Fountain, the Streams that proceed from it; <HI>the Heart is deceitful, and de&s;perately wicked, who can know it? from it come Mur|ders, Adulteries, and Fal&s;e-witne&s;s:</HI> Now the awakened Sinner may &s;ee, that there is not the lea&s;t Grain of Goodne&s;s in his Heart, that he is quite dead in Sin, an Enemy

to God and his Law, <HI>&s;hapen in Iniquity, and conceived in Sin;</HI> whatever Sinners dream, the Te&s;timony of God is true, that <HI>the fle&s;hly Mind is Enmity again&s;t God (Rom.</HI> 8.7.) natural Men that are regular in Life, are plea&s;ed with a Notion of their own Goodne&s;s, but when their Eyes are opened by the Law and Spirit of God, to &s;ee their In&s;ide, they are frightned at the Sight; for they plainly find that they are full of impla|cable Spite again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed God, full of bruti&s;h, mean and immoderately &s;elfi&s;h Di&s;|po&s;itions, mere <HI>Mon&s;ters</HI> in <HI>Iniquity,</HI> My&s;te|ries of Sin, and Ma&s;&s;es of Abomination! in a Word, awakened Sinners find, that their &s;elfi&s;h, &s;orry Sort of Goodne&s;s, of which they boa&s;ted, and on which they depended, is but like the &s;pecious <HI>Skin</HI> of a <HI>Serpent;</HI> and here give me Leave to &s;ay, that &s;uch as oppo&s;e a &s;trong Repre&s;entation of the Corruption of human Nature, act the Part of Enemies to Chri&s;t, and the Souls of Men; for till Sinners &s;ee their Depravity, they will not be humble, and flee to the Mediator. (3.) The <HI>holy Spirit,</HI> by the <HI>Law, convinces</HI> the Sinner of a <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Sin;</HI> he clearly &s;ees that he is unju&s;tified and unconverted, and cannot be &s;aved in his pre&s;ent State; the <HI>Prodigal</HI> &s;aw he was <HI>peri&s;hing,</HI> before he aro&s;e and came to his Father, he felt him|&s;elf

<HI>lo&s;t</HI> and <HI>dead,</HI> before he was <HI>found</HI> and made <HI>alive (Luke</HI> 15.) <HI>The Commandment which was ordained to Life, I found to be unto Death; for Sin taking Occa&s;ion by the Commandment deceived me, and by it &s;lew me,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle; when the Law came with Power and Authority to his Con&s;cience, he was convinced he was a dead Man, in Law and Fact, i. e. &s;entenced to eternal Death, and void of &s;piritual Life, and therefore was &s;lain to all pre&s;ent and future Depend|ance upon Obedience to the <HI>Law</HI> for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, and a Right to Salvation, &s;ee <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.10, 11.

<P>THE two Heads that I am now to di&s;cour&s;e upon, according to the Order before propo&s;ed, are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> 1, To <HI>explain</HI> the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Conver&s;ion:</HI> And, 2. To <HI>repre&s;ent</HI> its <HI>Ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE NATURE of CONVERSION, may be thus de&s;cribed, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is a gracious <HI>Renewing</HI> of fallen Man, for Chri&s;t's Sake, after the <HI>moral Image</HI> of GOD, whereby the &s;everal <HI>Powers</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of the <HI>Soul,</HI> have new <HI>Qualities</HI> infu&s;ed, and free and general <HI>Tendencies</HI> towards God and divine Things, as their <HI>Element</HI> and <HI>Center;</HI> the Effect of which is, a Conver&s;ation agreeable to the Go&s;pel of CHRIST.

But the <HI>Apo&s;tacy</HI> of our fir&s;t Parents, in violating the Covenant of Works, broke the afore&s;aid <HI>Harmony,</HI> and introduced &s;uch a Depravity into the human Soul, as has both corrupted and mi&s;placed all its Faculties; the <HI>Mind</HI> is blinded, the <HI>Will ob&s;tinate,</HI> and the <HI>Affections</HI> confu&s;ed, either fixed upon &s;inful Objects, or carried towards lawful ones immoderately: The Will, a blind Power, u&s;urps the Under|&s;tandings Place, to direct and rule the Soul, and enforces its arbitrary Dictates by a tyran|nical Authority, which is very perilous. The Ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t certainly be in great Dan|ger, when a blind and furious Man has the Direction of the Helm in a Tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>NOW <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> is a <HI>Renewing</HI> us after the <HI>Image</HI> of GOD, not the <HI>Phy&s;ical,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting in the &s;piritual Nature of the Soul, for that we never lo&s;t, el&s;e our Souls mu&s;t

I call them Qualities, to &s;ignify that the E&s;&s;ence of the Soul &s;till remains the &s;ame, both before and after Conver&s;ion; the Al|mighty by this Change, does not Form a new Soul, as to Sub&s;tance, but only infu&s;es new and different Qualities or Di&s;po&s;itions, by which the Soul's Powers generally and freely incline to different Objects, from what they did before: The&s;e Qualities are that Principle of &s;piritual LIFE, that is in|&s;tantaniou&s;ly communicated at Conver&s;ion, which the &s;acred Scriptures inform us, is a <HI>Quickning of the Dead:</HI> As natural Life to which this alludes, is a fixed, abiding Prin|ciple of Action, and &s;preads its Influence through the whole Frame, this does &s;o likewi&s;e, and hence our Saviour ob&s;erves, that he <HI>that drinks of this Water, &s;hall never

change the natural, but moral Weakne&s;s of human Nature, for its De&s;ign is not to heal the Body, but the Soul; and therefore a Per&s;on may be much advanced in Holi|ne&s;s, and yet have but a weak Memory; yet as the Grace of God a&s;&s;i&s;ts our Appre|hen&s;ion of Foundation Truths, and fixes our Love upon them, it mu&s;t of Con&s;equence make us de&s;irous to retain them, and grieved when we do not, &s;o that we are like to re|member more of them than of any Thing el&s;e.

<P N="1">1.

Lilly of the Vallies; his Name is as Ointment poured forth, and his Garments &s;mell of Myrrh, Alloes, and Ca&s;&s;ia!</HI> He &s;ees in a &s;trong Point of Light, the <HI>Beauty</HI> of <HI>Holine&s;s;</HI> that in|ward Purity, and outward Circum&s;pection, which he before imagined to be needle&s;s Preci&s;ene&s;s, he now looks upon to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary and lovely; he perceives &s;triking Charms in <HI>Humility,</HI> and hone&s;t <HI>Zeal</HI> for God, which he never &s;aw before! (2.) The Mind yields a new A&s;&s;ent to them, not grounded upon Conjecture, Opinion, or hi&s;torical Credit; but upon the Application of divine Truths to the Soul, by the holy Spirit, whereby &s;uch pious Impre&s;&s;ions are made, as convince him of their divine Ori|ginal; thus the natural <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> of his Heart is healed, and he induced to yield a full and firm A&s;&s;ent to the ab&s;olute Cer|tainty of revealed Religion; he has a Wit|ne&s;s within him&s;elf, that it is <HI>no cunningly devi&s;ed Fable,</HI> but true, as God is Truth; his Views of Things, and A&s;&s;ent to them, being altered, it naturally follows; (3.) That the <HI>E&s;timate</HI> will be altered likewi&s;e, for that is formed according to the Appre|hen&s;ion we have of the Nature, Moment, and Certainty of Things, and the Temper and Character of Per&s;ons: Formerly he u&s;ed to think that <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> was but a

mere <HI>Whim</HI> of &s;ome melancholly, enthu|&s;ia&s;tical People, but now he &s;ees it to be of ab&s;olute <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and that notwith&s;tanding of all his good Meanings, Words, and Works, which he u&s;ed to think would do great Matters, he mu&s;t peri&s;h without it: Communion with God he now values, as the Life and Soul of <HI>Religion,</HI> which before he u&s;ed to think was either needle&s;s, or enthu&s;ia&s;tical&punc; and dangerous: That noble <HI>Zeal</HI> for God, that is ready to run any Ri&s;que for his Honour and Kingdom, which he formerly reckoned imprudent Ra&s;hne&s;s, now he judges to be amiable and heroic! and on the Contrary, <HI>trimming</HI> according to the Cu&s;toms of Times and Places, in Mat|ters of Religion, with de&s;ign to get Credit among the Ungodly, and &s;leep in a whole Skin, which he was wont to call <HI>Prudence,</HI> he now judges to be &s;neaking <HI>Cowardice,</HI> and &s;elfi&s;h <HI>Craft!</HI> Formerly he verily be|lieved that Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in Abun|dance, and therefore he faithfully &s;ought it, for that End; but now he finds his Faith to be a Falacy, and that Per&s;ons may be perfectly mi&s;erable, in the Mid&s;t of Afflu|ence! which can no more &s;atisfy the Mind, than Wind and Gravel the Stomach; he therefore, with <HI>Mo&s;es, e&s;teems Reproach for Chri&s;t, to be greater Riches than the Trea&s;ures

<P N="2">2. THE WILL is changed in the fol|lowing Re&s;pects, <HI>viz.</HI> (1.)

The Purpo&s;es of the Unregenerate re&s;pecting Religion, are weak, partial, and future; they do but half re&s;olve to &s;erve God, and that not at pre&s;ent, but in &s;ome future Point of Time; nor do they re&s;olve to for&s;ake all Sin, and perform all Duty, but only &s;ome, &s;uch as are con&s;i&s;tent with their Credit, Ea&s;e, and Intere&s;t: But the re&s;olves of the Converted are &s;trong, impartial, and pre|&s;ent; his Determination is full and firm to for&s;ake all Sin immediately, without a Mo|ment's Delay, and to perform every Duty required, by divine Help, though it &s;hould co&s;t him his Life!</P>
