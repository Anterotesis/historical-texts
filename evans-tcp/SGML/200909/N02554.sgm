<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly Beloved in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was very plea&s;ing unto me, to ob&s;erve &s;o ge|neral a De&s;ire among&s;t you, that a Monthly-Lecture might be preached in this Town: I was glad when ye &s;aid unto me, let us go into the hou&s;e of the Lord. And your Attendence of &s;uch a religious Exerci&s;e, hath been hitherto un|common and exemplary. I hope that you find God|line&s;s to be profitable for all things, having the pro|mi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. It is at the Reque&s;t of many of you, and with an aim at the Good of all your Souls, that the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es are made &s;o public. I am very &s;en|&s;ible, that they are far below the dignity of the Sub|jects treated of; and if they &s;hou'd (as mo&s;t probably they will in this critical Age) be cen&s;ured as weak and mean, I &s;hall not blame any for being of my Opi|nion: But I tru&s;t that you, to whom the&s;e Sermons were acceptable when preached, will read them with Candor, and a &s;uitable concern that ye may be edi|fied thereby. I &s;end them abroad in a plain Country-Dre&s;s, it being &s;uch as I could afford them, and which will be mo&s;t agreable to tho&s;e on whom I de|pend to give them Entertainment. You receive them from the Pre&s;s, in the &s;ame words that you had them from the Pulpit. &mdash; The &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, cannot (I think) be ju&s;tly excepted again&s;t. The Contempt of the glorious Go&s;pel is doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t provoking Evil of the Times, and is comprehen|&s;ive of all tho&s;e Sins, for which the righteous GOD hath a Controver&s;y with our Land: An E&s;&s;ay there|fore to rai&s;e in us due Tho'ts of the Excellency of the Go&s;pel, will not be judged needle&s;s. While we are contemplating &amp; adoring the Glory of GOD, which he hath di&s;cover'd in his late remarkable &amp; amazing works of Providence, we &s;hou'd not over-look, nor be unaffected with that brighter Di&s;play of it, which there is in the Go&s;pel. GOD's &s;aving manife&s;tation of him&s;elf, is not to be expected in his providential

Di&s;pen&s;ations, ordinary or extraordinary, nor in the Terrors of the Law, but in the Gla&s;s of his Go&s;pel. The Lord was not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire, but in the &s;till &s;mall voice, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 19.11, 12.</P>
<P>THE Voice of GOD, which is full of maje&s;ty, from the deep places of the Earth, hath awaken'd many to give the more earne&s;t Heed to his &s;weet &amp; gracious Voice, &s;peaking from Heaven in the Go&s;pel of CHRIST; and by the latter more than the former, is their Con|ver&s;ion (which we hope is real) effected. There are many excellent Sermons lately publi&s;h'd, to teach &amp; ex|cite us rightly to con&s;ider &amp; improve the terrible Works of GOD: and a Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Glory of the Go&s;pel, may al&s;o, by the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, &s;erve to promote the Reformation, which is &s;o earne&s;tly prayed &amp; la|bour'd for.&mdash;Altho', to our &s;hame &amp; &s;orrow it mu&s;t be &s;aid, there hath not been that noi&s;e &amp; &s;haking among the dry bones here, which there hath been in other places under the late awful Di&s;pen&s;ations, yet &s;ome (I hope) have been awakened to flee from wrath: and that they might continue to run well, and not look back, I have put them in remembrance of <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife.</P>
<P>THESE Sermons I dedicate unto you, my beloved People, and wi&s;h they might be profitable to your Souls, for which I will very gladly &s;pend, and be &s;pent.</P>
<P>I rejoyce in the Lord, that your Care of me hath flouri&s;hed, in the provi&s;ion ye have made for my out|ward Support, ever &s;ince I have been in the work of the Mini&s;try among&s;t you. And I &s;peak it to your prai&s;e, that I have not been nece&s;&s;itated to ask for any mainte|nance; but what ye have done towards it, ye have done of your own accord, as &s;en&s;ible that a Mini&s;ter is not to live on the Alms of his People, but that the La|bourer is worthy of his Hire. &mdash;There is one thing I need, and do now ask of you, <HI>to wit,</HI> Your more fer|vent Prayers unto GOD for me, that he would make me an able and faithful Mini&s;ter of the New Te&s;ta|ment; and that after I have preached to you in Chri&s;t's Name, I may not (as there is great danger that I &s;hall) peri&s;h eternally in his wrath. &mdash; Brethren pray for me, that the Word of the Lord may have free Cour&s;e among&s;t us, and be glorified.</P>

<P>THE Sovereignty and Power of divine Grace were marvellou&s;ly di&s;play'd in the Conver&s;ion of <HI>Paul,</HI> who before was a furious Per&s;ecutor of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t. And the Grace of God which was be&s;towed on him, was not in vain;</HI> for He <HI>laboured more abundantly than all his Fellow-workers unto the Kingdom.</HI> And GOD highly honoured Him, in propagating &amp; promoting <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> in the World, more by his Mini&s;try than any other Man's. The &s;hining Gifts &amp; extraordinary Succe&s;s of this great <HI>Apo|&s;tle,</HI> drew upon him the envious Hatred of <HI>fal&s;e Teach|ers;</HI> who maliciou&s;ly endeavour'd to bla&s;t his Repu|tation, and ob&s;truct his U&s;efulne&s;s. This oblig'd him to &s;peak much in his own vindication: which He did,
<PB N="2" REF="003029_0005_0FEFAE9A682D89A8">
not out of Arrogance and O&s;tentation, but a &s;incere re&s;pect to the Glory of GOD, and the Good of the Church. <HI>Do we begin again</HI> (&s;aith he in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of this Chapter) <HI>to commend our &s;elves? or need we as &s;ome others, Epi&s;tles of commendation to you, or Letters of commendation from you.</HI> The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> &s;peaks in the plural Number, becau&s;e He wrote not only in his own, but al&s;o in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Name to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> He had begun again in the preceding Chapter to commend him&s;elf, by declaring his faith|fulne&s;s, as he had done in his <HI>fir&s;t Epi&s;tle</HI> to them. But here he &s;eems to Check him&s;elf for it; and tells them, that he needed, not as <HI>others</HI> (meaning <HI>fal&s;e Apo&s;tles</HI> &amp; <HI>Teachers</HI>) commendatory Letters to them or from them: For they them&s;elves, in regard of the Succe&s;s of his Mini&s;try among&s;t them, were a <HI>living Epi&s;tle,</HI> that might &s;ufficiently recommend him to them, and to all other Churches. <HI>Ye are our Epi&s;tle written in our hearts, known and read of all men.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, You that have been Converted by my preaching, are a commendatory Epi&s;tle, which I carry about in my heart, having always a thankful and dear Remembrance of you, and which may &s;atisfy all that have heard of your Faith and Obedience, that I am a true Apo&s;tle and faithful Mini&s;ter of JESUS CHRIST. And he thus &s;trongly proves that they were &s;uch an Epi&s;tle. <HI>Fora&s;much as ye are manife&s;tly de|clared to be the Epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t mini&s;tred by us, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the living GOD, not in Tables of &s;tone, but in fle&s;hly Tables of the heart.</HI> Their holy Conver&s;ation declar'd them to be the Epi&s;tle of CHRIST. By them CHRIST &s;ig|nified his Mind and Will to others, as a Man doth his by a Letter. They were a living Rule, &s;hewing by their Actions how all ought to walk. JESUS CHRIST with his Spirit, that accompanied the Apo&s;tle's Mini|&s;try, did make &s;aving Impre&s;&s;ions on their Hearts; wrote his Law, not on Tables of Stone, but fle&s;hly Tables, the Hearts of Believers. <HI>And &s;uch Tru&s;t have we through Chri&s;t to God-ward.</HI> The Apo&s;tle was humbly confident, that GOD had thus ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="3" REF="003029_0006_0FEFAE9C51F88278">
his Mini&s;try to them. <HI>Not that we are &s;ufficient of our &s;elves to think any thing as of our &s;elves: but our &s;ufficiency is of God. Paul</HI> acknowledgeth that He was &s;o far from being the Author of the good Work in the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Chri&s;tians, that He could not of him&s;elf &s;o much as <HI>think.</HI> A Man cannot think any thing without the Influence of divine Providence, and he cannot think a good Thought without the Influ|ence of divine Grace. Every Act is from GOD, as he is the <HI>GOD of Nature,</HI> and the Goodne&s;s of any Act is from Him, as He is the <HI>GOD of all Grace.</HI> The Apo&s;tle was very careful not to exalt him&s;elf, when he was <HI>magnifying his Office. Our &s;ufficiency</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>is of GOD: who al&s;o hath made us able Mini&s;ters of the New Te&s;tament.</HI> i. e. The Go&s;pel, called a Te&s;tament, becau&s;e it is a free &amp; firm Di&s;|po&s;ition of the Mediator's good things unto the Heirs of Salvation, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them according to his <HI>Will;</HI> and the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> in regard of the an|cient Promi&s;es of tho&s;e good things under the <HI>Law.</HI> The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> having thus a&s;cribed unto GOD, the Prai&s;e of all his Ability for and Succe&s;s in the <HI>Work of the Mini&s;try,</HI> He proves the Dignity of his Office by drawing a Compari&s;on between the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and &s;hewing how the latter did exceed the former in <HI>Glory.</HI> By &s;everal Arguments he de|mon&s;trates the &s;urpa&s;&s;ing Excellency of the Go&s;pel; and in our <HI>Text</HI> declares that the Law, altho' glori|ous in it &s;elf, and the manner of it's delivery, yet compar'd with the Go&s;pel, hath no Glory at all: like as the Glory of the Stars di&s;appears at the ri&s;ing of the Sun. <HI>For even that which was made glo|rious, had no glory in this re&s;pect, by rea&s;on of the glory that excelleth.</HI></P>

<P N="1">I. <HI>THE Go&s;pel is more Glorious than the Law, in regard of the</HI> fir&s;t Publi&s;her <HI>of it.</HI></P>
<P>THE Law is, in our Text, &s;aid to be that, <HI>which was made Glorious:</HI> Be&s;ides it's intrin&s;ick Glory, there was &s;ome additional Glory made to it, by GOD'S &s;ending of it to his People, by the hand of &s;o <HI>excellent a Per&s;on,</HI> as He did: But the Glory which the Go&s;|pel hath in re&s;pect of the <HI>tran&s;cendent Dignity</HI> of the <HI>Lord's Me&s;&s;enger,</HI> who fir&s;t publi&s;hed it, far exceedeth <HI>that.

Prophet: but <HI>the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> by <HI>whom the Go&s;|pel at fir&s;t began to be &s;poken,</HI> did infinitely excel Him. The <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was promi&s;ed of old, as a <HI>Pro|phet like unto Mo&s;es,</HI> Deut. 18.15. He did in many re&s;pects &s;ignally re&s;emble <HI>Mo&s;es:</HI> but this don't im|ply that <HI>he</HI> was not in all &s;uperior to him. CHRIST was not only like to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s chiefe&s;t Excel|lencies, but He al&s;o infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him. Heb. 3.3. <HI>This Man was counted worthy of more glory than Mo&s;es. Mo&s;es</HI> was but a <HI>Man, Chri&s;t</HI> was GOD as well as <HI>Man: Mo&s;es</HI> was not without Sin, but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was <HI>holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, &s;eparate from Sinners: Mo&s;es</HI> was only a Servant, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was al&s;o <HI>the Son of GOD.</HI> When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> came down from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> bringing the <HI>two Tables of Te&s;timony,</HI> his Face &s;hone with a dazling Glory, Exod. 34.30. <HI>When Aaron and all the Children of I&s;rael &s;aw Mo&s;es, behold, the skin of his Face &s;hone, and they were afraid to come nigh him.</HI> This is mention'd in our Context, <HI>v.</HI> 7. as one thing which made the Law glorious; <HI>The mi|ni&s;tration of Death written and ingraven in &s;tones, was glorious, &s;o that the Children of I&s;rael could not &s;tedfa&s;tly behold the Face of Mo&s;es, for the Glory of his Countenance.</HI> The Lu&s;tre &s;pread on the Face of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> was an evidence to the Jews, of the <HI>GOD of Glory's</HI> &s;ending him to publi&s;h the <HI>Law</HI> unto them. But <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> far excel'd <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the vi&s;ible Glory wherewith his Face did &s;hine, when GOD, by a voice from Heaven, declar'd him to be his Son, by whom he would &s;peak, and unto whom Men &s;hou'd hearken. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in all his Glory, was not arrayed with &s;uch Splendor as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was, at his &s;olemn Inve&s;titure into his Office. <HI>When Je&s;us was baptized, Heaven was opened</HI> to pour down it's Glory on him: <HI>and the holy Gho&s;t de&s;cended in a bodily &s;hape, like a Dove upon him,</HI> Luk. 3.21, 22. The holy Gho&s;t is incor|poreal, but he then a&s;&s;umed a bodily vi&s;ible Shape, and doubtle&s;s one that was very bright and glorious. Some think, that it cannot be concluded from what the Scripture &s;aith concerning the holy Gho&s;t's De|&s;cent on <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that he appeared in the form of a Dove:
<PB N="6" REF="003029_0009_0FEFAEA6DC9477A0">
But &s;uppo&s;e that he a&s;&s;um'd a Body of Light, or Fire, and therein came down, in &s;uch like manner as a <HI>Dove,</HI> with it's Wings &s;pread forth, and gathering about our SAVIOUR'S Head cover'd and crown'd it with a vi&s;ibly Glory. But why may we not, according to the Letter of the Scripture, conceive that the bodily Shape in which the <HI>holy Gho&s;t</HI> de&s;cended on <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> was that of a Dove, intimating the Dove-like Di&s;po|&s;ition of the <HI>harmle&s;s</HI> JESUS? And yet, we have rea&s;on to believe that it was in &s;ome luminous form, &s;ome extraordinary appearance of Light, that the holy Gho&s;t came down on our Saviour. <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Bapti&s;m &s;aith, that there was a Fire lighted in the River <HI>Jordan.</HI> "By which it appears, that it was an early Tradition in the Church, that the Water, immediately after <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was baptized in it, &s;eem'd to be all on Fire by the Reflection of that bright and flaming appearance, in which the holy Gho&s;t de&s;cended upon him". And at his Tran&s;|figuration on Mount <HI>Tabor, His Face did &s;hine as the Sun, and his Raiment was white as the Light,</HI> Mat. 27.2. His Face did &s;hine as the Sun in it's meridian Brightne&s;s, and his Raiment was like the whitne&s;s of a fla&s;h of Lightning. The three Di&s;ciples that were with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> on the Mount, were afraid and a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ight, as <HI>Aaron</HI> and the I&s;raelites were at the &s;ight of the Glory on <HI>Mo&s;es's</HI> Face. The <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> which <HI>Chri&s;t received from GOD the Father,</HI> at his Bapti&s;m and Transfiguration, was too great to be communicated to any but the <HI>Son of GOD;</HI> It was therefore the Sign, by which <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t knew him to be the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> and upon which he groun|ded his Te&s;timony concerning him, Joh. 1.33, 34. <HI>I know him not: but he that &s;ent me to baptize with water; the &s;ame &s;aid unto me, upon whom thou &s;halt &s;ee he Spirit de&s;cending and remaining on him, the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> which baptizeth with the holy Gho&s;t.

the <HI>Son of GOD:</HI> Such Glory wou'd not be imparted to any other. <HI>John</HI> the Evangeli&s;t, who was an Eye|witne&s;s of the Glory &s;hed on <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> at his Transfigu|ration, and probably of that at his Bapti&s;m al&s;o, doth partly with reference thereunto &s;ay, Joh. 1.14. <HI>We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father.</HI> The Glory was &s;uch as became him, who was the only begotten Son of GOD: It was que&s;tionle&s;s therefore a Glory far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that on the Face of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when he brought down the Law from <HI>Sinai. Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t be infinitely more glorious than <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> being the <HI>Brightne&s;s of God's glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on,</HI> Heb. 1.3. <HI>In him dwelt all the fulne&s;s of the</HI> infinite <HI>Godhead bodily,</HI> and from him did it &s;hine forth <HI>in the Days of his Fle&s;h,</HI> he being the Effulgence of his <HI>Father's Glory.

<P>THUS, in re&s;pect of the Glory which the Law and Go&s;pel receive from the &s;hining Excellencies of the fir&s;t Publi&s;hers thereof, the latter doth abundantly exceed the former in Glory.</P>

When the LORD came down on Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> holy Angels were the Chariots of his Glory, He rode upon Cherubims, and there was an illu&s;tri|ous Appearance of Myriads of them, P&s;al. 68.17. <HI>The Chariots of God are twenty thou&s;and, even thou|&s;ands of Angels: the Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the holy place.</HI> The Mount was altogether on a &s;moke, becau&s;e the LORD de&s;cended upon it in Fire: and the &s;moke thereof a&s;cended as the &s;moke of a Fur|nace,
<PB N="8" REF="003029_0011_0FEFAEAAF5F80270">
and the whole Mount quaked greatly: <HI>Sinai</HI> was moved at the Pre&s;ence of the GOD of I&s;rael. There was the &s;ound of a Trumpet, long and loud; the noi&s;e of Thunders, and the voice of Words, very ter|rifying. The glorious manner in which GOD gave the Law on <HI>Sinai,</HI> is elegantly &s;et forth by the Pro|phet, Hab. 3.3, 4. <HI>GOD came from Teman, and the holy One from Mount Paran, Selah. His Glory covered the Heavens, and the Earth was full of his Prai&s;e,</HI> or Splendor. <HI>And his brightne&s;s was as the light, he had horns,</HI> or bright Beams, <HI>coming out of his hand:</HI> "Rays of Glory were darted forth around Him" With &s;uch Tokens of Maje&s;ty was the Pro|mulgation of the Law attended. But, altho' there was le&s;s Terror, yet there was not le&s;s Glory in the Circum&s;tances which accompanied the fir&s;t Publication of the Go&s;pel. It was u&s;her'd in, by Angel's decla|ring and celebrating the Birth of JESUS, that Horn of Salvation which GOD promis'd to rai&s;e up unto his People, in the Hou&s;e of his Servant <HI>David.</HI> The poor <HI>Shepherds</HI> at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> &s;aw as great <HI>Glory</HI> there, and as bright an Apparition of Angels, as the I&s;raelites did at <HI>Sinai,</HI> and heard more glorious Words, Luke 2.9, 10, 11. <HI>Lo, the Angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord &s;hone round about them; and they were &s;ore afraid. And the Angel &s;aid unto them, fear not, for behold, I bring you good tydings of great Joy, which &s;hall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour; which is Chri&s;t the Lord.</HI> ver. 13, 14. <HI>And &s;uddenly there was with the Angel, a multitude of the heavenly ho&s;t, prai&s;ing God, and &s;aying, Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on Earth peace, good will towards Men.</HI> &mdash; A glorious Lamp was lighted in the aetherial Heaven, an extraordinary Star appeared, to give notice to the World of the Ap|proach of the <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Matth. 2.1, 2. <HI>Now when Je&s;us was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king: behold, there came wi&s;e men from the Ea&s;t to Jeru&s;alem, &s;aying, where is He that is born king of the Jews? for we have &s;een his Star in the Ea&s;t, and are come to wor&s;hip

him.</HI> &mdash; Was there not more Glory deriv'd on the Go&s;pel, from what was done and &s;aid at <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Bapti&s;m and Transfiguration, than there was on the Law, from all that Maje&s;ty and awful Pomp that Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> was cover'd with? What a glorious Scene was it, for Heaven to open, and the holy Gho&s;t vi&s;ibly to de&s;cend on <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to array Him with a daz|ling Splendor, and &s;uch a voice to come from the <HI>excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed, hear ye Him?</HI> Was there any Brightne&s;s at <HI>Sinai,</HI> comparable to that on Mount <HI>Tabor?</HI> or any Voice &s;o glorious? &mdash; And in order to the more full and exten&s;ive Publication of the Go&s;|pel, by the Apo&s;tles of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the De&s;cent of the holy Gho&s;t upon them, at the Fea&s;t of Penteco&s;t (the &s;ame time of the Year, that the Law was given at <HI>Sinai)</HI> was a thing which equal'd, if not exceeded in glory, any Circum&s;tance which attended the Pro|mulgation of the Law. There was indeed no Trum|pet, nor terrifying Voice, no Thunder, Darkne&s;s nor Tempe&s;t, but <HI>a &s;ound from Heaven, as of a ru&s;hing mighty Wind, and it filled all the Hou&s;e where the Apo&s;tles were &s;itting;</HI> and there was the Appearance of bright flames of Fire, cleaving a&s;under; and in the form of Tongues re&s;ting on the Heads of the Di&s;ci|ples, and they &s;pake all Languages to the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of multitudes who were then pre&s;ent, <HI>Act.</HI> 2. So that the publication of the Go&s;pel was graced with as remarkable and glorious Circum&s;tances, as that of the Law. It might al&s;o, under this Head, be &s;hown, How the Miracles which attended the publication of the Go&s;pel, thro' <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s and his Apo&s;tle's time on Earth, did, both in number and greatne&s;s, far exceed tho&s;e which accompanied the Promulgation of the Law. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Prophets</HI> did not, all of them do, &s;o many, nor &s;uch mighty Works, as <HI>JESUS of Nazareth</HI> did.

and with diver&s;e Miracles, and gifts of the holy Gho&s;t, according to his will?</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>THE Go&s;pel is more glorious than the Law, in re&s;pect of its revealing the Glory of GOD &s;o much more clearly and fully, than the Law doth.</HI></P>
<P>THE Go&s;pel exceeds the Law, not only in an acci|dental or adventitious, but al&s;o an intrin&s;ick Glory. The Law was not only made glorious in the Eyes of the Children of I&s;rael, by the dignity of the Per&s;on and lu&s;tre on the face of Mo&s;es, by whom it came, and the manner of its delivery, but it was glorious in it &s;elf; being a <HI>Revelation</HI> from GOD of his Ex|cellencies to his Creatures, and his Will concerning them: But the Go&s;pel is more glorious in it &s;elf, being a clearer, and more compleat <HI>Revelation</HI> of GOD'S Glory. This is hinted by the Apo&s;tle in our Context, where he is &s;hewing how the Go&s;pel exceeds the Law in Glory, v. 18. <HI>But we all with open face, beholding as in a Gla&s;s the Glory of the Lord. Mo&s;es</HI> put a Vail over his Face, when he came down from the Mount, that &s;o all the Glory of his Countenance might not be &s;een, might not this repre&s;ent GOD'S concealing from the Jewi&s;h People much of his Glory, which was afterwards to be manife&s;ted? v. 13. <HI>Mo&s;es put a Vail over his face, that the Children of I&s;rael could not &s;tedfa&s;tly look to the end of that which is aboli&s;hed.</HI> They had but an ob&s;cure View of the My&s;tery of CHRIST, which was vailed under the Types and Shadows of the Ceremonial Law; like as the Glory on the face of Mo&s;es was vailed. v. 14 <HI>But their Minds were blinded: for until this day re|maineth the &s;ame vail untaken away, in the reading of the Old Te&s;tament: which vail is done away in Chri&s;t.</HI> The vail of outward Shadows and Types was removed, by <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> coming into the World: for then the Prefigurations, Prophe&s;ies and Promi&s;es of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> were fulfilled, and the Glory of GOD in our Redemption by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was to be clearly &s;een: But the vail of &s;piritual Blindne&s;s on the Minds and Hearts of the Jews, which was al&s;o my&s;tically
<PB N="11" REF="003029_0014_0FEFAEB45FB22E78">
&s;ignified by the Vail upon the face of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> remains to this day in their reading the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> which hinders them from di&s;covering the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> to be already come, and that the Types and Prophe&s;ies are accompli&s;hed in him. <HI>But we all with open face,</HI> all we who believe have the Vail removed from us, &s;o that <HI>with open face</HI> we <HI>behold the Glory of the Lord as in a Gla&s;s, i. e.</HI> in the Go&s;pel, which is as a Gla&s;s, not a Per&s;pective thro' which things afar off are darkly &s;een, but a Looking-gla&s;s fully repre&s;enting the face as near. <HI>The Glory of the Lord,</HI> which was vail'd and cover'd under the Types and Shadows of the <HI>Law,</HI> is now by the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> clearly revealed. And how Chri&s;|tians do in the Go&s;pel, as it is a Gla&s;s, &s;ee the <HI>Glory of GOD,</HI> the Apo&s;tle telleth us, 2 Cor. 4.6. <HI>For GOD who Commanded the light to &s;hine out of dark|ne&s;s, hath &s;hined in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of GOD, in face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> By the face of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in which the Glory of GOD is &s;een, the Apo&s;tle &s;eems to allude to that divine Lu&s;tre with which the Face of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;hone, when he came down from Mount <HI>Sinai:</HI> So that his meaning may be this, That as the Children of I&s;rael with their bodily Eyes &s;aw &s;omething of GOD'S Glory &s;hining in the Face of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> &s;o they the Di&s;ciples of our Saviour, did more clearly with the Eyes of their enlightned Under&s;tandings behold the divine Glory in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who&s;e Face the Gla&s;s of the Go&s;pel repre&s;ented to them. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the <HI>brightne&s;s of God's Glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on.</HI> There is no Perfection in GOD, which is not in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is GOD. And in that Gla&s;s wherein we &s;ee the Face of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> who is thus the Image of GOD, we behold the Glory of GOD; and in the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is more clearly revealed. By the Law Men might di&s;cern, as it were GOD'S <HI>Back-parts.</HI> As He &s;aid unto <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who be&s;eeched the LORD to &s;hew him his Glory, Exod. 33.23. <HI>Thou &s;halt &s;ee my back-parts: but my Face &s;hall not be &s;een:</HI> But in the Go&s;pel we may &s;ee the <HI>Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;o the <HI>Face of</HI> GOD;

for CHRIST is the adequate and e&s;&s;ential <HI>Image</HI> of GOD. The knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;o of GOD'S Glory, which could be obtain'd by the Writings of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> was &s;mall, compar'd with that which the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> affords; and did not the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> expound the <HI>Old,</HI> wou'd not the <HI>Vail on the face of Mo&s;es,</HI> as to us, <HI>remain untaken away.</HI></P>

<P>GOD'S Goodne&s;s is his Glory; and this is mo&s;t clearly and fully revealed in the <HI>Go&s;pel;</HI> the &s;um of which is, <HI>that God is in Chri&s;t, reconciling the World unto him&s;elf, not imputing their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them.</HI> The <HI>moral Law</HI> di&s;covers nothing of GOD'S Mercy toward &s;inful Creatures: and the <HI>ceremonial Law</HI> had only a <HI>&s;hadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things:</HI> It contain'd a dark and imperfect, not a lively and full Repre&s;entation of tho&s;e <HI>good things,</HI> which the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD de&s;igned for mi&s;erable Sinners. The My&s;tery of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which the Go&s;pel reveals, was under the legal Di&s;pen&s;a|tion wrapped up in Types, Ceremonies, and ob&s;cure Prophe&s;ies and Promi&s;es. The Go&s;pel, the <HI>Preaching of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the revelation of the my&s;tery, which was kept &s;ecret &s;ince the world began,</HI> Rom. 16.25. The Riches of Grace, the un&s;earchable Riches of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> were, in a great mea&s;ure hid, before the Go&s;pel open'd them; &s;o that as the Prophet, and after him, the Apo&s;tle &s;aid concerning the &s;ame, <HI>Eye had not &s;een, nor Ear heard, neither had entred into the Heart of Man, the things which God hath prepared for them that Love him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Glory of divine</HI> Wi&s;dom, <HI>&s;hining in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is eminently di&s;played in the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Bowels of GOD'S Mercy were troubled for us, the Mouth of his Ju&s;tice was opened again&s;t us mi&s;erable Sinners. Ju&s;tice demanded the ever|la&s;ting

Therefore he employ'd his infinite <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> in the Coun&s;el of Peace between the Father and the Son, to contrive a Method of Redemption, in which the&s;e Attributes &s;hou'd harmonize, Ju&s;tice and Mercy ki&s;s each other, and be glorified together. And this adorable <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> the Go&s;pel reveals; <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> which was before <HI>hidden,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.7.

<P>THUS the Glory of GOD, e&s;pecially the Glory of his <HI>Mercy</HI> &amp; <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> is mo&s;t clearly di&s;cover'd in the Go&s;pel, Joh. 1.18. <HI>No man hath &s;een God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in the bo&s;om of the Father; he hath declared him.</HI> The Bo&s;om is the Seat of Love, and Repo&s;itory of Secrets: <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t who is in the bo&s;om of God the Father,</HI> hath by the Go&s;pel made known his tender Compa&s;&s;ions and my|&s;terious Coun&s;els.

The Law <HI>of Commandments contained in Ordi|nances</HI> was a <HI>Wall of Partition,</HI> that fenced the Jewi&s;h Nation, and &s;ever'd, them from others, making them GOD'S Sacred Inclo&s;ure, into which the Gentiles &s;hould not come, to partake of the Privileges of the <HI>Church.</HI> The Ceremonial Law is &s;tiled the <HI>Enmity,</HI> being the cau&s;e and &s;ign of Enmity between <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> keeping them at a di&s;tance from one another. Thus the <HI>Law</HI> was confined within nar|row Bounds; was directed and re&s;trained to the U&s;e of one Nation, and that the <HI>fewe&s;t of all People.</HI> But the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is a Di&s;pen&s;ation, in it's Nature, and in it's Author's De&s;ign, general: or &s;uch as re&s;pects Mankind, without any di&s;tinction of Nation. There is no Monopoly of it's Privileges. It is proportion'd to the need, and ordain'd for the benefit of Men of all Nations and Conditions. The Go&s;pel is (as the angelical Preacher &s;aid) <HI>Good tydings of great Joy, which &s;hall be to all people,</HI> Luke 2.10. <HI>The Grace of God,</HI> i.e. The Go&s;pel <HI>that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all Men,</HI> Tit. 2.11. Chri&s;t <HI>hath broken down the middle wall of partition between</HI> Jews and Gentiles; <HI>Having aboli&s;hed in his fle&s;h the enmity, even the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances: and came and preached Peace,</HI> i. e.

It is true, that under the Law GOD be&s;towed his Spirit on his Servants, Neh. 9.20. <HI>Thou gave&s;t al&s;o thy good Spi|rit, to in&s;truct them.</HI> But the holy Spirit is more plentifully granted under the <HI>Evangelical,</HI> than it was under the <HI>Legal</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation.

"There were &s;ome &s;prinklings of it under the law, and confin'd to a &s;e|parate Nation, but now &s;howers are poured down upon all Nations, to make them fruitful in good Works". On this account the Go&s;pel is far more glorious than the Law, as the Apo&s;tle argueth in our Context, Ver. 7, 8. <HI>If the mini&s;tration of death</HI> (i. e. the Law) <HI>written and ingraven in &s;tones was glori|ous &mdash; How &s;hall not the mini&s;tration of the Spirit be rather glorious?</HI></P>

And he &s;aid unto them, I be|held Satan as Lightning fall from Heaven.</HI> Our Saviour in this Expre&s;&s;ion, might allude unto Satan's fir&s;t Fall from Heaven; when of an Angel of Light he became a Spirit of Darkne&s;s, and was in a mo|ment ca&s;t down from his glorious Seat in Heaven: So by the Preaching of the Go&s;pel he &s;hou'd be turn|ed out of the Throne which he had u&s;urped on Earth, and fall from his great Power in the World, as Light|ning fla&s;heth &amp; vani&s;heth away &s;uddenly &amp; irrecovera|bly. When the Go&s;pel was fir&s;t publi&s;hed by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and Tho&s;e &s;ent by him immediately to preach it, the King|dom of darkne&s;s was &s;oon weakned, and did appa|rently go to wreck. The <HI>Devil</HI> was beaten out of his Territories, his Temples were demoli&s;hed, his Altars thrown down, and his Oracles &s;ilenced. With that <HI>Rod of his Strength</HI> which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ent out of <HI>Zion,</HI> he de&s;troyed the <HI>Works of the Devil,</HI> 2 Cor. 10.4. <HI>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty thro' God, to the pulling down of &s;trong Holds.</HI> The <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> Warfare again&s;t <HI>Principalities</HI> and <HI>Powers</HI> was &s;piritual, the Weapons they u&s;ed were not carnal, yet mighty thro' GOD: They atchie|ved glorious Conque&s;ts, but not by the edge of the Sword, or &s;tratagems of War: The Go&s;pel was, thro' GOD the mighty and effectual Weapon, with which they batter'd the Devil's Fortre&s;&s;es, and over-turn'd his Dominion. The Go&s;pel prevail'd again&s;t the Learning of Philo&s;ophers, and Power of Earthly Kings, and gloriou&s;ly triumph'd over all the Oppo&s;ition

which it met with from the Gates of Hell. <HI>Dagon</HI> fell before the <HI>Ark</HI> of GOD; and the <HI>Magicians</HI> Ser|pents were devoured by <HI>Aaron's</HI> Rod; &s;o the Go&s;pel was too hard for all the Strength and Wi&s;dom of the World.

<P>IN regard of tho&s;e things e&s;pecially, which the Go&s;pel, accompanied with the holy Spirit, effecteth in the Souls of Believers, the Apo&s;tle doth in our Text and Context &s;o magnify it above the Law.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Go&s;pel worketh effectually to the Con|ver&s;ion of Souls.</HI></P>
<P>NOT only was <HI>Satan's</HI> vi&s;ible Kingdom in the World marvellou&s;ly de&s;troy'd by the Go&s;pel, at the fir&s;t Preaching of it, but al&s;o his invi&s;ible Empire in the Hearts of Sinners is continually broken by this <HI>Rod of Chri&s;t's &s;trength, which he hath &s;ent out of Zion.</HI> This da&s;heth in pieces the <HI>Works of the De|vil</HI> within Men, as powerfully as it did tho&s;e with|out them. The <HI>&s;trong Holds</HI> which he hath erected in the Souls of Men, blindne&s;s of Mind, hardne&s;s of Heart, &s;tubbornne&s;s of Will, and the like, are demo|li&s;hed by the Go&s;pel, as gloriou&s;ly as were the fal&s;e Religions, Idolatries and Super&s;titions, which he had &s;et up in the World. Luke 11.21, 22. <HI>When a &s;trong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace. But when a &s;tronger than he &s;hall come upon him, and

overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he tru&s;ted, and divideth his &s;poil. Satan</HI> is the &s;trong Man armed, the Heart of every uncon|verted Sinner is his Garri&s;on which he keeps &s;hut up, and barred again CHRIST, by unrea&s;onable Pre|judices, carnal Inclinations and worldly Intere&s;ts; but the <HI>King of Glory,</HI> by his Spirit in the Go&s;pel, comes upon, and ca&s;ts out the &s;trong Man armed, &s;torms and takes his Fort, and converteth it into a <HI>holy Temple.</HI> Upon the <HI>white Hor&s;e</HI> of the pure Word of Truth, the mighty Redeemer &s;till <HI>rideth forth conquering, and to conquer,</HI> Rev. 6.2. By means of the Go&s;pel Per&s;ons are <HI>turned from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</HI> The Go&s;|pel, and not the Law, is the In&s;trumental Cau&s;e of &s;aving Conver&s;ion, Cont. ver. 8. <HI>The Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.</HI> The moral Law revealing Man's Duty, and denouncing GOD'S Wrath again&s;t Him for not performing it, <HI>killeth:</HI> It makes Sin to revive in the Con&s;cience, and the guilty to dye. It only &s;heweth Sinners that they are <HI>dead Men,</HI> being condemned already; and di&s;covers to them no po&s;&s;ible way of e&s;caping the Cur&s;e, and offers no Grace, no &s;upernatural Strength unto them to enable them to get out of the State of Nature. <HI>But the Spirit giveth Life:</HI> The Go&s;pel which is called the <HI>Spirit quickeneth</HI> tho&s;e who are <HI>dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins.</HI> Spiritual Life is infu&s;ed by means of the Go&s;pel: The holy Gho&s;t u&s;eth it as his In&s;trument in quick|ning of dead Souls, Converting of &s;inful Men, Joh. 5.25. <HI>Verily, verily I &s;ay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear &s;hall live.</HI> CHRIST'S voice in the Go&s;pel rai&s;eth the &s;piritually dead. The beginning and progre&s;s of Conver&s;ion is by means of the Go&s;pel; the whole conformity of the Soul unto <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is wrought thereby; as the Apo&s;tle &s;heweth in our Context, Ver. 18. <HI>We all with open face, beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame Image; from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> The fight of the
<PB N="20" REF="003029_0023_0FEFAED039B46E30">
LORD'S Glory in the Gla&s;s of the Go&s;pel, is tran&s;|forming; Changeth the Soul into the Image and like|ne&s;s of CHRIST. The Spirit of GOD worketh a &s;a|ving Change in the Heart of a Sinner, by giving him a clear view of CHRIST'S Glory, as the Go&s;pel repre|&s;ents it. And the holy Gho&s;t carries on the work of Sanctification in Believers, by enabling them to &s;ee more and more of the LORD'S Glory in that Gla&s;s: They are changed into his Image, <HI>from Glory to Glory;</HI> that is, from one degree of Grace to another, until they arrive to the perfection of Holine&s;s. All the De|grees of our conformity to CHRIST are &s;tiled Glory; the fir&s;t and lowe&s;t degree of Grace is Glory begun, and the highe&s;t is Glory perfected. Believers &s;ee the Glory of the Lord in the Go&s;pel, and are changed into the &s;ame Image, <HI>from Glory to Glory;</HI> that is, (as one conceiveth from the allu&s;ion to a Gla&s;s) "The Glory of the Lord &s;hining upon the Go&s;pel, and from the Go&s;pel &s;hining upon our Hearts, doth Change them into the Image of the &s;ame Glory; even as the Glory of the Sun &s;hining upon a Gla&s;s, and from that Gla&s;s reflecting on a Wall, doth therein produce an Image of it's own light." Thus it is by the Go&s;pel that a &s;aving Change is wrought in the Soul. This Glory is peculiar to the Go&s;|pel. It is &s;aid indeed, that <HI>the Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul,</HI> P&s;al. 19.7. But by the <HI>Law</HI> here, as in many other Texts of Scrip|ture, is meant the whole Word of GOD, compre|hending the Promi&s;es of Salvation by <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> The <HI>mo|ral Law</HI> is not the In&s;trumental Cau&s;e of Conver&s;ion. It prepares a Soul for Conver&s;ion, ina&s;much as by it is the <HI>knowledge of Sin:</HI> It convinceth the Sinner of Guilt, and de&s;erved Damnation, but leaves him &s;hut up under the fearful Cur&s;e, without the lea&s;t hope of e&s;cape. Did not the Go&s;pel reveal that <HI>God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the world unto him&s;elf,</HI> the awa|ken'd Sinner wou'd pine away in his Iniquities. It is not the Terror of the LORD, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Law, but his Glory &s;hining in the Go&s;pel, that pro|duceth a &s;aving Change in the Heart.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="21" REF="003029_0024_0FEFAED2AC234D18">2. PEACE of Con&s;cience <HI>is an excellent Effect of the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>BY Peace of Con&s;cience, I mean that re&s;t and com|fort which the believing Soul enjoyeth in the expecta|tion and per&s;wa&s;ion of GOD'S Mercy thro' CHRIST, to pardon and &s;ave it. This is the product of the Go&s;|pel of Peace. The Law is in our Context &s;tiled the <HI>mini&s;tration of Condemnation,</HI> becau&s;e it pa&s;&s;eth the Sentence of Death upon the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of it, and gives Con&s;cience it's Authority to condemn the Sinner: But the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is called the <HI>mini&s;tration of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> becau&s;e it exhibits and offers a Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;uf|ficient for our Ju&s;tification: <HI>Therein is the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of God revealed from faith to faith,</HI> Rom. 1.17. The Go&s;pel revealing that perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which GOD graciou&s;ly imputeth without the Works of the Law, to tho&s;e who believe in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is the means of &s;etling an happy Peace in the Con&s;cience. Now, as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith in the ver&s;e immediately preceding our Text, <HI>If the mini&s;tration of Condemna|tion be glory, much more doth the mini&s;tration of Righteou&s;ne&s;s exceed in Glory.</HI> The Go&s;pel far excels the Law in that it is the mini&s;tration of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o of Peace. It is true, there is &s;ome mention made of this Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Writings of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Prophets;</HI> hence it is &s;aid, Rom. 3.21, 22. <HI>Now the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God without the Law is manife&s;ted, being witne&s;&s;ed by the Law and the Pro|phets; even the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God which is by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, unto all, and upon all them that believe.</HI> But by the <HI>Law</HI> here the Apo&s;tle doth not intend the <HI>moral Law,</HI> for that is wholly &s;ilent con|cerning an imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s: But he means the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances, the <HI>ceremonial Law;</HI> and it is certain, that the Sacrifices under the Law did typify the Death of CHRIST, by which we have now received the Atonement; and there were al&s;o many Prophe&s;ies and Promi&s;es of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the <HI>Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and yet the glorious My&s;tery of Ju&s;tification by Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> was in a great mea&s;ure kept &s;ecret until the Go&s;pel mani|fe&s;ted

<P>THE glorious Liberty of the Children of GOD is &s;poken of, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.21.

By the <HI>Liberty</HI> of the Children of GOD, we may under&s;tand &s;uch an ingenuous Di&s;po&s;ition as that Men do look upon, and act towards GOD as a gracious Father, in and thro' JESUS CHRIST. The <HI>Law,</HI> the <HI>Covenant from Mount Sinai gendreth to Bondage,</HI> Gal. 4.24. Tho&s;e who are under it, are in the Condition of Slaves, not of Sons.

But the Go&s;pel produceth a Child-like Temper in the Souls of Be|lievers.

<P>HAVING thus Illu&s;trated and Confirmed the Truth, I proceed to Apply it.</P>
<P N="1">1. IS the Go&s;pel &s;o much more glorious than the Law? We may hence infer <HI>the great Dignity of the Evangelical Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>IT is con&s;i&s;tent with the Humility that &s;hou'd cloath the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>lowly JESUS,</HI> to a&s;&s;ert the Dig|nity of their &s;acred Employment. The holy Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> who counted him&s;elf le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints, is, in the Chapter wherein our Text is, mag|nifying his Office; and he &s;trongly proves it honou|rable from the tran&s;cendent Glory of the Go&s;pel. His genuine Inference from his large Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Excellency of the Go&s;pel is that in Ver. 12, 13. Cont. <HI>Seeing then that we have &s;uch hope, we u&s;e great plainne&s;s of &s;peech, and not as Mo&s;es, who put a vail over his face.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, The Go&s;pel being in &s;o many re&s;pects more glorious than the Law, and e&s;pecially &s;ince, according to our certain Expecta|tion, it &s;hall continue to the End of the World, I am not a&s;hamed of my mini&s;tration, but do thus boldly vindicate my Apo&s;tle&s;hip, and do not, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> vail the Glory which the LORD hath put upon me. The more excellent a divine Revelation is, the more noble

is their Office, who are &s;ent with it to the Children of Men. It was glorious to be a Mini&s;ter of the Law, it is much more &s;o to be a Mini&s;ter of the <HI>Go&s;pel. John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, CHRIST'S Harbinger and Herald, was more than a Mini&s;ter of the <HI>Law, more than a Prophet: The Law and the Prophets were until John:</HI> But in his Time <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was actually exhibited, and he declar'd the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> to be already come, pointing him out, as it were with the Finger, &s;aying, <HI>Behold the Lamb of GOD.</HI> So that <HI>John</HI>'s Mini|&s;try excel'd any that was before; yet when our <HI>Sa|viour</HI> was &s;peaking of <HI>John</HI>'s greatne&s;s, he &s;how'd that under the Evangelical Di&s;pen&s;ation, when the Go&s;pel &s;hou'd be fully preached, the lea&s;t Mini&s;ter thereof wou'd, in re&s;pect of his Office, be greater than <HI>John,</HI> be a more honourable Officer than he, Matth. 11.11. <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath not ri&s;en a greater than John the Bapti&s;t: notwith&s;tanding, he that is lea&s;t in the Kingdom of Heaven, is greater than he.</HI> The more glorious a Kingdom is, the more honourable is an Office in it: The Go&s;pel Kingdom is termed the Kingdom of Heaven; the Glory of it exceeds that of all the Kingdoms of this World: To be a Mini|&s;ter therefore of CHRIST'S &s;piritual Kingdom on Earth, is no mean Preferment. No <HI>Man taketh this Honour unto him&s;elf,</HI> without horrid U&s;urpation, <HI>but he that is called of GOD</HI> to this high and holy Office, &s;hou'd be very humble and thankful; &s;aying with the great Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> Eph. 3.8. <HI>Unto me, who am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints, is this Grace given, that I &s;hould preach among the Gentiles the un&s;earchable Riches of Chri&s;t:</HI> And, 1 Tim. 1.12. <HI>I thank Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the Mini&s;try.</HI>&mdash; And they unto who&s;e Tru&s;t the glorious Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD is committed, &s;hould be careful to &s;upport the Dignity of their Office, which they can do in no &s;uch effectual way, as by di&s;charging faith|fully the Duties belonging to it&mdash; And let <HI>every Man &s;o account of them, as the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t,

and Stewards of the my&s;teries of God:</HI> and this is to count them <HI>worthy of double honour,</HI> and to <HI>e&s;teem them very highly in Love for their work's &s;ake.</HI> That is &s;poken of, and in the New-Te&s;tament is directly ap|ply'd to the Mini&s;ters of the glorious Go&s;pel, which we read in I&s;a. 52.7. <HI>How beautiful upon the moun|tains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publi&s;heth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publi&s;heth &s;alvation, that &s;aith unto Zion, thy God reigneth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. DOTH the Go&s;pel exceed the Law in Glory? then <HI>the Sin of De&s;pi&s;ing it is very great.</HI></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the Go&s;pel is &s;o incomparably glorious, yet there are multitudes that de&s;pi&s;e it. When it was fir&s;t publi&s;hed to the World, the generality of Men look'd upon it as a very mean or ridiculous Doctrine, and not worthy to be regarded by Ratio|nal Beings: They called the Preaching of it <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> And the mo&s;t of Men do not entertain a better Opinion of it, at this Day: Some de&s;pi&s;e it &s;o as to reject the Knowledge of it; they have no de&s;ire and take no pains to under&s;tand the glorious Truths contained in it. Some are <HI>a&s;hamed of the Go&s;pel of CHRIST,</HI> a&s;ham'd to profe&s;s it; and how light do Sinners com|monly make of the Overtures of Grace therein? All who believe not in CHRIST, and walk not accor|ding to the Rules of the Go&s;pel, are guilty of de&s;pi|&s;ing it. He that breaks the Law de&s;pi&s;eth it, 2 Sam. 12.9. <HI>Wherefore ha&s;t thou de&s;pi&s;ed the Commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his &s;ight?</HI> So all who di&s;|obey the Go&s;pel de&s;pi&s;e it; and the greatne&s;s of their Sin and Folly appears from the Glory of the Go&s;pel. The more excellent any thing is, the more vile is the Contempt of it. As much as the Go&s;pel exceeds the Law in Glory, &s;o much wor&s;e is it for Men to de&s;pi&s;e the Go&s;pel than the Law, and expo&s;eth them to &s;o much heavier Puni&s;hments. Heb. 10.28, 29. <HI>He that de&s;pi&s;ed Mo&s;es Law, died without mercy, under two or three witne&s;&s;es: of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment, &s;uppo&s;e ye, &s;hall he be thought worthy, who hath

trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was &s;ancti|fied, and unholy thing, and hath done de&s;pite unto the Spirit of Grace?</HI> Contempt of the Go&s;pel is treading the Son of GOD underfoot, as if he were really a <HI>Worm</HI> and <HI>no Man,</HI> much le&s;s GOD: It is <HI>&s;etting of him at nought,</HI> as truly as <HI>Herod</HI> with his Men of War did, when they made a mock-King of him: It is trampling the Redeemer's Grace, as if it were nothing worth: And it is counting his pre|cious Blood, which is <HI>the Blood of the Covenant,</HI> an unholy, a common thing; &s;uch as pollutes rather than purifies the Soul. De&s;pi&s;ing the Go&s;pel is <HI>doing De|&s;pite unto the Spirit of Grace,</HI> the holy Gho&s;t, which accompanies the Go&s;pel to per&s;wade Men of the Truth and Excellency of it, and to make it of &s;aving Efficacy to them. So great is the Sin of Go&s;pel-Contempt that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aid concerning tho&s;e who were guilty of de&s;pi|&s;ing the Law and the Prophets, Joh. 16.22 &mdash; 24. <HI>If I had not come, and &s;poken unto them, they had not had Sin: but now they have no cloke for their Sin &mdash; If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had Sin: but now they have both &s;een, and hated both me and my father.</HI> The righteous GOD puni&s;heth this Sin with the greate&s;t Judgments, temporal, &s;piritual and eternal. Wrath came not upon the Jews <HI>to the uttermo&s;t,</HI> un|til they de&s;pi&s;ed and per&s;ecuted the Go&s;pel, Mat. 22.7. <HI>When the King heard thereof, he was wroth: and he &s;ent forth his Armies,</HI> (the Romans) <HI>and de&s;troyed tho&s;e murderers, and burnt up their City.</HI> The &s;ore&s;t outward Calamities are brought on a People, who en|joy the Go&s;pel, for their Contempt of it. GOD is provoked by Men's de&s;pi&s;ing the Go&s;pel, to &s;mite them with Judicial Blindne&s;s, &s;o that they never &s;hall &s;ee the Glory of it, <HI>Joh.</HI> 12.40, 41. They who con|temptuou&s;ly &s;hut their Eyes again&s;t the light of the Go&s;pel, GOD often Judicially clo&s;eth their Eyes, and delivers them to the Power of Satan to blind them, 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <HI>If our Go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them

<P N="3">3. LET what hath been &s;aid, <HI>rai&s;e our E&s;teem of the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>THAT which is glorious ought to be valu'd by us, and according to the degree of it's Excellence. The Di&s;play of the tran&s;cendent Glory of the Go&s;pel &s;hou'd excite and confirm in us a due E&s;teem of it. &mdash; What hath been &s;aid concerning the Glory of the Go&s;pel, di&s;parageth not the Law, and will not ju&s;tify the Con|tempt of it. The Law is glorious, and de&s;erveth e&s;teem. It was a mo&s;t &s;uitable Revelation for the People to whom, and the Time wherein it was gran|ted. Infinite Wi&s;dom judg'd it fit that the di&s;covery of GOD'S Mind &amp; Will concerning the Salvation of fallen Man, &s;hou'd be like the dawning <HI>Light, which &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect day.</HI> A meri|dian Brightne&s;s was not proper for the Morning of the Church Times. Under the Law the Church was, as it were, in her non-age; and the In&s;tructions GOD gave were &s;uited to her Capacity. Believers were then Children, and the Law was their School-ma&s;ter, to teach them the Elements, the Rudiments, the fir&s;t Principles of divine Knowledge: Gal. 3.24. <HI>The Law was our School-ma&s;ter to bring us unto Chri&s;t:</HI> It was to prepare the Church for the <HI>Univer&s;ity</HI> of the Go&s;|pel,
<PB N="29" REF="003029_0032_0FEFAEE8DF64BE40">
in which the Knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is more fully taught. GOD vouch&s;afed further light to his People by extraordinary Prophets which he &s;ent unto them: He at <HI>&s;undry Times, and in diver&s;e manners, &s;pake unto the Fathers by the Prophets,</HI> who predicted what the Law prefigur'd, and gave many Promi&s;es of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> Yet it was not perfect day-light until the <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> aro&s;e; then the &s;hadows fled away, "and the whole Horizon of heavenly Truth was di&s;clos'd." So that altho' the Law was glorious the divine Revelation before the fulne&s;s of Time came was excellent, and to be greatly e&s;teemed, yet the Go&s;|pel is far more glorious, and to be more highly va|lued. The In&s;tructions of the Law were <HI>beggarly Ele|ments,</HI> mean Rudiments, in compari&s;on of the deeper and more full In&s;tructions of the Go&s;pel. That is a notable Prophecy concerning the Evangelical Di&s;pen|&s;ation, Jer. 3.14, 15, 16. <HI>I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion. And I will give you Pa&s;tors according to mine heart, which &s;hall feed you with knowledge &amp; under|&s;tanding. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s when ye be mul|tiplied and increa&s;ed in the Land; In tho&s;e days, &s;aith the Lord, they &s;hall &s;ay no more, The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord: neither &s;hall it come to mind, neither &s;hall they remember it, neither &s;hall they vi&s;it it, neither &s;hall that be done any more.</HI> The days of the Me&s;&s;iah are here intended, in which GOD'S People &s;hould be fed with Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding, by faithful evangelical Pa&s;tors, in a way different from the Jewi&s;h In&s;titution. And their prizing the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation above the former, is expre&s;s'd by their not remembring, mentioning, nor vi&s;iting the <HI>Ark of the Covenant.</HI> The Ark was called, <HI>The Glory;</HI> it was very much the Glory of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> It was an eminent Type of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> (the Glory of his People;) and a Symbol of GOD'S Pre&s;ence with his ancient Church. The Old-Te&s;tament Saints had it in high account; nothing was more precious unto them: yet it is here foretold, that when <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the Antitype of the
<PB N="30" REF="003029_0033_0FEFAEEA98E5B7E0">
Ark, &s;hould he come, and a more &s;piritual Wor&s;hip erected, then there &s;hould be no mention made of the <HI>Ark,</HI> it &s;hould not be remembred, nor come into mind, <HI>neither &s;hall that be done any more in it,</HI> or, as the Margin renders this, <HI>It &s;hall not be magnified any more,</HI> It &s;hall not be had in honour or re&s;pect, or be made much of. The whole <HI>ceremonial Law</HI> is not to be valued in compari&s;on of the glorious <HI>Go&s;pel;</HI> nor the <HI>carnal</HI> Ordinances of the former, to be men|tioned in the &s;ame day with the <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Ordinances of the latter. The <HI>moral Law</HI> is to be highly e&s;teem'd. GOD will <HI>magnify this Law, and make it honourable.</HI> It is truly excellent and honourable in it &s;elf; and the things of it are <HI>great things,</HI> and &s;hou'd be &s;o in our account. But the moral Law is only a Revelation of GOD'S Will concerning Man's Duty, not of his Good-Will concerning Man's Sal|vation. It &s;heweth us what we ought to do, and con|demns us for not doing it, and leaves us without hope of e&s;caping it's dreadful Cur&s;e. It is a perfect Rule of Obedience, but affords no &s;trength unto impotent Man to walk according to it. Now the Go&s;pel doth not make void the Law, as it is a perfect Rule of Life and Manners, but re-inforceth it, and farther &s;hews how the Sinner may be freed from the Cur&s;e, revealing a Righteou&s;ne&s;s that an&s;wers the Demands of the Law, and offers Strength to enable us &s;incerely &amp; acceptably to keep the divine Precepts. All the intrin&s;ic Glory which the <HI>moral Law</HI> hath, the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> hath, and much more: We &s;hould therefore give the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> the preference to the <HI>Law</HI> in our e&s;teem. GOD'S Law was more de&s;ired by his Saints than <HI>Gold, yea than much fine Gold,</HI> It was better to them than <HI>Thou&s;ands of Gold &amp; Silver.</HI> How then ought we to prize the glorious Go&s;pel? It is an ine&s;tirnable Pearl we &s;hou'd be willing to part with all things rather than to be with|out it, Matth. 13.4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, 46. <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant-man, &s;eeking goodly Pearls: who when he had found one Pearl of great price, he went and &s;old all that he had, and bought it.</HI> How

<P N="4">4. LET us all be &s;olicitous that <HI>the Go&s;pel may produce it's glorious Effects in our Souls.</HI></P>
<P>WE have &s;een that the Go&s;pel is far more glorious than the Law in regard of tho&s;e wonderful Effects produced by it in the Souls of Men: We &s;hould be anxiou&s;ly concern'd that this Glory of the Go&s;pel be manife&s;ted and magnified in our Conver&s;ion &amp; Salva|tion. There mu&s;t indeed be fir&s;t a Work of the Law on our Hearts, convincing us of Sin and Wrath, to prepare us for a Work of the Go&s;pel, in Changing our Hearts, and encouraging us to believe in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> We mu&s;t &s;eek, that the <HI>Commandment</HI> may come with power on our Souls, to revive the &s;en&s;e of our Guilt and Mi&s;ery, and to &s;lay us; to make us &s;ee that we are condemned Malefactors, dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins: and then that the Go&s;pel may come unto us in <HI>Power, &amp; in the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> to give us life. We mu&s;t look for a &s;aving Change to be wro't in us by the Go&s;pel, as a fit In&s;trument in the Hand of GOD'S <HI>Spi|rit.</HI> The <HI>moral Law</HI> was never de&s;ign'd for this u&s;e.

The Glory on the Face of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> which was &s;uch that the I&s;raelites could not &s;tedfa&s;tly behold him, is not &s;ufficient; there mu&s;t be a di&s;covery of the <HI>Glory of GOD in the Face of JESUS CHRIST,</HI> in order to a &s;aving Illumi|nation. The Glory of divine Mercy &amp; Wi&s;dom in our Redemption by CHRIST, mu&s;t be &s;een by him that believes in CHRIST, and is transformed into his Image. Let us therefore give <HI>earne&s;t heed</HI> to the Go&s;pel, as the In&s;tituted ordinary Means of thorow Conver&s;ion.

<P N="5">5. FROM what has been &s;aid, Let us be incited to <HI>a more diligent Study of the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>THE Glory of GOD is more fully and clearly re|veal'd in the Go&s;pel, than it is in the Law: But we cannot &s;ee it, nor be affected with it, unle&s;s we apply our Minds to the &s;tudy of the Go&s;pel. The My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel afford the mo&s;t delightful Entertainment to inqui&s;itive Minds. The ancient <HI>Prophets,</HI> who foretold &s;omething of the Glory of the Go&s;pel, us'd
<PB N="33" REF="003029_0036_0FEFAEF2D2A49540">
to &s;tudy their own Prophecies concerning it, 1 Pet. 1.10, 11, 12. <HI>Of which Salvation the Prophets have enquired, and &s;earched diligently, who prophe&s;ied of the Grace that &s;hould come unto you: &s;earching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Chri&s;t which was in them did &s;ignify, when it te&s;tified before|hand the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, and the Glory that &s;hould follow: Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto them&s;elves, but unto us they did mini&s;ter the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the Go&s;pel, with the holy Gho&s;t coming down from Heaven, which things the Angels de&s;ire to look into.</HI> The holy Prophets with great diligence and delight &s;earched into tho&s;e unfathomable My&s;te|ries of Grace, that were in dark Expre&s;&s;ions &s;poken of by them&s;elves, as moved by the Spirit of GOD, and which are more fully and clearly declared in the Go&s;|pel: <HI>Which Things</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>the Angels de&s;ire to look into.</HI> This Expre&s;&s;ion is allu&s;ive to the <HI>Cherubims</HI> which were over the Ark, a Type of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> looking down earne&s;tly upon it, as if they would pry into it. The ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Angels, who behold the Face of GOD in Heaven,</HI> do as it were turn their Eyes from viewing his Glory in the upper World, and bend down their &s;acred Heads to look into the glorious My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel. The manifold Wi&s;dom of GOD made known to the Principalities and Powers in heavenly Places, by the Di&s;pen&s;ation of his Grace toward the Church, is wonderful and ravi&s;hing to them. And &s;hall not we &s;tudy tho&s;e things, which the glorious Angels think &s;o worthy their Contemplations? Let us faithfully improve all Means, that are proper and appointed for our Information in the great and impor|tant Truths of the Go&s;pel. Let us, with the very learned Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, Count all things but lo&s;s for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, our Lord.</HI> &mdash; And as <HI>David</HI> prayed unto GOD, &s;aying, <HI>Open thou mine Eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy Law;</HI> &s;o let us pray that GOD

<P N="6">6. LET Chri&s;tians be Exhorted to <HI>adorn the glori|ous Go&s;pel, the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</HI></P>
<P>WE cannot add to the intrin&s;ick Glory of the Go&s;|pel, but we &s;hould te&s;tify and declare it's Excellency by having our Conver&s;ation in the World <HI>as becometh the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> It is a Reproach to the glori|ous Go&s;pel, and brings it into Contempt, when tho&s;e who profe&s;s it walk not according to the holy and ex|cellent Rules of it, Rom. 2.23, 24. <HI>Thou that ma|ke&s;t thy boa&s;t of the Law, thro' breaking the Law di&s;honoure&s;t thou God? For the name of God is bla&s;phemed among the Gentiles thro' you.</HI> So when Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity di&s;obey the Precepts of it, they darken the Glory of the Go&s;pel, and di&s;honour the Name of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> We <HI>receive the Grace of GOD</HI> the Go&s;pel <HI>in vain,</HI> as to our own Souls, unle&s;s we conform our Lives to it: as it is &s;hown they had as good have been without the Law, who did not keep it, Jer. 8.8. <HI>How do ye &s;ay, we are wi&s;e, and the Law of the Lord is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it, the Pen of the Scribes is in vain.</HI> And we render the Go&s;pel unprofitable to others al&s;o by our un&s;uitable Lives: We increa&s;e and confirm their Prejudices, which hinder their &s;eeing the Glory of the Go&s;pel.&mdash; But the Lu&s;tre of a godly Conver&s;ation is an Ornament to the glorious Go&s;pel, which we profe&s;s. The regular Practice of all the duties which the Go&s;pel requires, &s;ets forth the Glory of the Go&s;pel to be&s;t Advantage, and recommends it to tho&s;e, before whom our Light &s;hineth, and may convince even Infidels that the Go&s;pel came from the <HI>GOD of Glory.</HI> Chri&s;tians of the lowe&s;t Rank are obliged thus to adorn the Go&s;pel, Tit. 2.9, 10 <HI>Let our Conver&s;ation</HI> therefore <HI>be as it becometh the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> Phil. 1.27. 1 The&s;. 2.11, 12. <HI>As ye know how we exhorted, and comforted, and

<P N="7">7. LET us be very <HI>Thankful to GOD</HI> for the Go&s;|pel.</P>
<P>WHAT hath been &s;aid concerning the Glory of the Go&s;pel (tho' <HI>one half hath not been told</HI>) may well excite our thankful Prai&s;es unto GOD for it. <HI>What Advantage had the Jews</HI> above the Gentiles? <HI>Much every way, chiefly becau&s;e that unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</HI> And Chri&s;tians have a va&s;t advantage above the Jews, in that the <HI>glori|ous Go&s;pel of the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD</HI> is committed unto them. <HI>GOD hath provided &s;ome better thing for us, that they without us &s;hould not be made perfect.</HI> The Go&s;pel is a greater Glory unto a People, among whom it is di&s;pen&s;ed in the Power &amp; Purity of it, than the Ark was to I&s;rael; and more Glory is due therefor unto GOD from tho&s;e who enjoy it. How glad would the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> and <HI>Prophets</HI> of old have been, to have &s;een and heard what we do under the Evangelical Di&s;pen&s;ation? Matth. 13.16, 17. <HI>But ble&s;&s;ed are your Eyes, for they &s;ee; and your Ears, for they hear: for verily I &s;ay unto you, that many Prophets and righteous Men have de&s;ired to &s;ee tho&s;e things which ye &s;ee, and have not &s;een them: and to hear tho&s;e things, which ye hear; and have not heard them.</HI> They indeed by the Per|&s;pective of Faith &s;aw the promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ings; but they &s;aw them <HI>afar off,</HI> had but an ob&s;cure View of them to what is now granted. With the Eagle-Eye of Faith <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;aw the Day of Go&s;pel-light at a great di&s;tance, and the remote Pro&s;pect which he had of it, made him to rejoice greatly, Joh. 8.56. <HI>Your Father Abraham rejoyced to &s;ee my day: and he &s;aw it, and was glad.</HI> Should not tho&s;e who live in that day, much more rejoyce in, and be thankful for the Light and Glory of it?

<P>OUR Ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR &s;peaking to his Di&s;ciples of the calamitous De&s;truction which &s;hou'd be brought on <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> warn'd them to flee out of it, when they &s;hou'd &s;ee the <HI>Abomination of De&s;olation &s;tanding in the holy Place: i. e.</HI> The Roman Ar|my be&s;ieging the City. In the ver&s;e immediately pre|ceding our Text he &s;aid, <HI>In that day, he which &s;hall be in the hou&s;e-top, and his &s;taff in the hou&s;e, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewi&s;e not turn back:</HI> As if he had &s;aid, Let every one of my Servants make all po&s;&s;i|ble ha&s;te to get out of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> when the Judg|ments of GOD &s;hall be irre&s;i&s;tibly breaking in upon it. And to pre&s;s this Advice, and excite them to flee with the greate&s;t &s;peed, He added the&s;e words, <HI>Re|member Lot's Wife.</HI> &mdash; And what he &s;aid to them, he now &s;aith to us all, whom he is warning to flee from Wrath, <HI>Remember Lot's Wife.</HI> We &s;hould remem|ber her, not for our Imitation, but for our Admonition and Awakning. &mdash; We &s;hould remember her Sin, and her Puni&s;hment, and may receive much In&s;truc|tion and &s;piritual Profit therefrom.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="40" REF="003029_0042_0FEFAF030EDF3870">I. <HI>WE &s;hou'd remember the</HI> SIN <HI>of Lot's Wife.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is recorded, Gen. 19.26. <HI>His Wife looked back from behind him.</HI> In her flight from <HI>Sodom</HI> &s;he looked back. But how was this a Sin? Wherein con&s;i&s;ted the &s;infulne&s;s of her &s;o doing? What fault was it for a poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Woman to look back upon the City where &s;he had dwelt, and where her Friends &amp; Acquaintance were, and from whence &s;he was taking her final Departure? Might &s;he not without offence turn her Eyes upon <HI>Sodom</HI> as &s;he was e&s;caping from it? Might &s;he not &s;ee it once more before it was utterly con&s;umed? Might &s;he not ca&s;t an Eye of Pity towards, and Weep for her mi&s;erable Neighbours in flames of Brim&s;tone?</P>
<P>HER looking back was &s;inful,</P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE it was contrary to a <HI>divine Prohibition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>SIN is a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law. Lot's</HI> Wive's looking back on <HI>Sodom</HI> was the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a particular Law, the breach of an expre&s;s Order given them, Gen. 19.17. <HI>It came to pa&s;s when they had brought them forth abroad, that he &s;aid, E&s;cape for thy Life, look not behind thee. Lot</HI>'s Wife, as well as he, was &s;olemnly Charged not to <HI>look behind;</HI> &s;o that &s;he did that which was expre&s;ly and plainly forbidden her. And to act contrary to the lea&s;t Commandment, or Prohibition of the great GOD, is no &s;mall offence, no petty fault. <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wive's Di&s;o|bedience may be illu&s;trated by that of <HI>Saul</HI>'s, in &s;pa|ring the be&s;t of the <HI>Amalekites</HI> Sheep and Oxen for Sacrifice; This was very offen&s;ive to GOD, becau&s;e contrary to an expre&s;s Order given him to &s;lay them all: The Prophet thus &s;et his Sin before him, 1 Sam. 15, 22, 23. <HI>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than &s;acrifice, and to hearken than the fat of Rams. For rebellion is as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of witchcraft, and &s;tubbornne&s;s it is as iniquity and idolatry. Saul</HI>'s rebellion in that matter, which was in it &s;elf &s;mall, was as really a Sin, &amp; Provocation
<PB N="41" REF="003029_0043_0FEFAF04A9D96100">
of GOD'S Wrath as Witchcraft or Idolatry. It was a Contempt of the great Lawgiver's Authority. And &s;o was <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wive's looking back. <HI>Abraham</HI> the &s;ame Morning looked toward <HI>Sodom,</HI> and &s;aw the &s;moke of it's Torments a&s;cending, <HI>Gen.</HI> 19.27, 28. This was no Sin in <HI>Abraham,</HI> for he was not for|bidden to look toward <HI>Sodom:</HI> But it was a great Sin in <HI>Lot's Wife</HI> to look back upon it, for the Lord had &s;aid to her, <HI>Look not behind thee.</HI></P>
<P>THIS teacheth us, to mea&s;ure Sin by the Command|ment; and &s;o it will appear <HI>exceeding &s;inful.</HI> Per&s;ons are ready to make light of many evil Actions, and to &s;troke them with a gentle Cen&s;ure, becau&s;e they are not &s;o gro&s;s &amp; crying as others. But the matter in which we Sin is not &s;o much to be regarded, as the Authority which is thereby de&s;pi&s;ed. What is in it &s;elf &s;mall &amp; incon&s;i|derable is a great offence, if the Lord hath forbidden it. The fir&s;t Woman took of the fruit of a certain Tree in <HI>Eden,</HI> and eat it. Could &s;o &s;mall a thing as the eat|ing an Apple be very offen&s;ive to GOD? Yet <HI>the Lord God &s;aid unto the Woman, What is this thou ha&s;t done?</HI> Gen. 3.13. What an heinous Crime ha&s;t thou committed? Becau&s;e GOD had expre&s;ly &s;aid, <HI>Of that Tree thou &s;halt not eat.</HI> GOD'S Authority is con|temned, his Will re&s;i&s;ted by our doing the lea&s;t thing which he hath forbidden; therefore no &s;uch Act mu&s;t be accounted by us a &s;mall offence. We &s;hould not &s;ay of it, as <HI>Lot</HI> did of <HI>Zoar,</HI> which he de&s;ir'd might be &s;pared to be the City of his Refuge, <HI>Is it not a little One?</HI> Sometimes the &s;maller the matter is in which we tran&s;gre&s;s, the greater is the Offence; as when the Prohibition of it is very plain &amp; peremp|tory, the Temptation unto it &s;light, and it be a thing which might ea&s;ily be left undone. What&s;oever we do contrary to the declared Will of GOD, is a horrid In|dignity offer'd to his Maje&s;ty &amp; Authority: It is Re|bellion, which in every ca&s;e is as the Sin of Witchcraft and Idolatry.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN <HI>Lot's Wive's</HI> looking back upon <HI>Sodom</HI> there was a <HI>Contempt of GOD's Omni&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>SHE not only de&s;pis'd the Authority &amp; Com|mandment
<PB N="42" REF="003029_0044_0FEFAF07E1BAA4C0">
of GOD, but al&s;o practically deny'd his Omni&s;cience: for it is &s;aid, that &s;he <HI>locked back from behind Lot.</HI> She committed this Sin &s;ecretly. She was behind her Husband; and &s;ince his Eye was not upon her, &s;he ventur'd to look back; thereby expre&s;|&s;ing a Contempt of GOD'S all-&s;eeing Eye. She was afraid that if <HI>righteous Lot</HI> &s;aw her he wou'd be angry with her for di&s;obeying the Lord; but not afraid that a <HI>Righteous GOD</HI> would &s;ee her, and be di&s;plea|&s;ed at her Sin. This is an aggravation of &s;ecret Sins, that the Omni&s;cience of GOD is e&s;pecially contemned thereby; as if the Eye of GOD was not to be &s;o much regarded &amp; reverenc'd as the Eye of Man.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>LOT</HI>'s <HI>Wive's</HI> looking back on <HI>Sodom</HI> procee|ded from an <HI>evil Heart of Unbelief.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Angels</HI> which came to <HI>Lot</HI>'s Hou&s;e, told him, and his Wife, that &s;wift De&s;truction was coming upon <HI>Sodom: Lot</HI> inform'd his Sons in-law of it, and &s;aid unto them, <HI>Up, get ye out of this place, for the Lord will de&s;troy this city: but he &s;eemed unto them as one that mocked.</HI> Altho' his <HI>Wife</HI> did not reject the Warning with &s;uch &s;corn, as they did, yet it &s;eems, that &s;he que&s;tion'd the Truth of the Threatning, and therefore look'd back to &s;ee whether it would be Executed or not. It was &s;aid to her, <HI>Look not behind thee, le&s;t thou be con&s;umed.</HI> But &s;he did not believe &s;he &s;hou'd be con&s;umed for looking back. It is &s;aid in the Book of the <HI>Wi&s;dom of Solomon,</HI> chap. 10. v. 7. <HI>That a &s;tanding Pillar of Salt, is a Monument of an unbelieving Soul.</HI>&mdash;Not to believe GOD, is to make him a Liar: It is a great Sin, to doubt of his Veracity in his Menaces, as well as Promi&s;es. Such Unbelief is the Root of Di&s;obedience. Men de&s;pi&s;e the Com|mandments of GOD, becau&s;e they do not believe his Threatnings, Heb. 3.12. <HI>Take heed, Brethren, le&s;t there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in de|parting from the living God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THERE was the <HI>Lu&s;t of the Eye</HI> in <HI>Lot's Wive's</HI> looking back upon <HI>Sodom.</HI></P>
<P>"IT was a look of Covetou&s;ne&s;s". <HI>Sodom</HI> was a rich and plea&s;ant place: It was even <HI>as the Garden of
<PB N="43" REF="003029_0045_0FEFAF09F4D227E0">
the Lord,</HI> Gen. 13.10. <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife was very loth to go out of it; &s;he lingered in it, (as indeed <HI>Lot</HI> him&s;elf did) after &s;he was warned to flee; the An|gels laid hold on her hand, and brought her forth, and &s;et her without the City, <HI>plucking her as a Brand out of the Fire:</HI> and &s;he went not far from <HI>Sodom</HI> before her Love to her worldly accommodations there, made her look back, with unea&s;y De&s;ires to return to it, there to enjoy the Wealth, Plea&s;ures &amp; Friends which &s;he had left. So that her Sin was great: her Rebellion was as the Sin of Idolatry, for <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s is Idolatry:</HI> It is loving and &s;erving the Crea|ture more than the Creator. We cannot obey GOD, &s;o long as this Lu&s;t remains unmortified: We may &s;eem to hearken to his Call for a time, and to flee from Wrath; but if we love the World, and the things of it, we &s;hall look, and draw back unto Perdition, 2 Tim. 4.10. <HI>Demas hath for&s;aken me, having lo|ved this pre&s;ent World.</HI> We &s;hould remember <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, that we may <HI>take heed and beware of Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>LOT</HI>'s Wive's looking back on <HI>Sodom</HI> imply'd a <HI>Contempt of the Mercy of GOD</HI> in delivering her out of it.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Lord</HI> was about to rain "Hell out of Heaven" upon <HI>Sodom,</HI> and the Neighbouring Cities, he &s;ent his Angels (and one of them was the ble&s;&s;ed Angel of the Covenant, for he is &s;tiled <HI>Jehovah,</HI> Gen. 19.24.) GOD &s;ent them to bring out <HI>Lot,</HI> and his Wife and Children, that they might not be con&s;umed in the Iniquity &amp; Overthrow of <HI>Sodom.</HI> The <HI>Lord</HI> being <HI>merciful</HI> did this: <HI>Lot</HI> &s;pake of it with Admiration, &s;ay|ing, <HI>Behold now, thy Servant hath found Grace in thy &s;ight, and thou ha&s;t magnified thy mercy which thou ha&s;t &s;hewed unto me in &s;aving my Life.</HI> But his Wife de&s;pi&s;ed &s;o great a Mercy; &s;he had low Thot's of it: &s;he did not accept the miraculous Deliverance with Thankfulne&s;s: &s;he was &s;o un&s;uitably affected with the Kindne&s;s GOD had &s;hown her in &s;aving her Life, that &s;he look'd back on <HI>Sodom</HI> with a di&s;contented Eye, be|cau&s;e &s;he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> from her worldly Enjoyments there.
<PB N="44" REF="003029_0046_0FEFAF0D4EB70B48">
This vile Ingratitude made her Sin &s;o heinous in GOD'S &s;ight. When Mercy is de&s;pi&s;ed, Wrath is ex|a&s;perated: Sins committed after &s;ignal Deliverances, are exceedingly aggravated. Ezra 9.13, 14.&mdash; <HI>Seeing that thou our God ha&s;t given us &s;uch Deliverance as this, &s;hould we again break thy Commandments?</HI> The gracious GOD hath &s;ent the chief of tho&s;e Angels which he &s;ent to <HI>Sodom,</HI> the glorious increated Angel, the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> into the World, to deliver us from the everla&s;ting Burnings of Hell: Let us not imi|tate <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife in de&s;pi&s;ing this great Mercy.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;hould remember and improve the <HI>Sin</HI> of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>WE &s;hou'd remember the</HI> PUNISHMENT <HI>of</HI> Lot's <HI>Wife:</HI> the terrible Judgment which GOD inflicted upon her.</P>
<P>THIS is recorded for our Admonition, Gen. 19.26. <HI>She became a Pillar of Salt.</HI> When &s;he looked back, &s;he was &s;truck dead upon the &s;pot, and was turned into a <HI>Pillar of Salt.</HI> By her becoming a Pillar of Salt, &s;ome I think, under&s;tand no more than her being made a la&s;ting Monument of GOD'S &s;evere Ju&s;tice; as a perpe|tual Covenant is &s;tiled a <HI>Covenant of Salt,</HI> Num. 18.19. But why the literal Sen&s;e of the words &s;hould be rejec|ted, I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on; but do believe that &s;he was really turned into a <HI>Pillar,</HI> a Statue <HI>of Salt,</HI> a kind of rocky, mineral Salt, which will endure all Weathers and not wa&s;te away. <HI>Naturali&s;ts</HI> write of Salt which is hard enough for Buildings.&mdash; <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> who lived &s;ince <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was on Earth, &s;aith that the Pillar of Salt was &s;tanding in his Time, and that He him&s;elf had &s;een it. And the like is affirmed by others &s;ince his time. &mdash; We are now call'd to look upon it with the Eyes of our Minds.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE &s;hou'd remember the Puni&s;hment of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, becau&s;e it repre&s;ents to us the <HI>evil Nature,</HI> and <HI>infinite Demerit</HI> of Sin.</P>
<P><HI>LOT</HI>'s Wives Puni&s;hment was &s;evere &amp; dreadful, yet it did not exceed the de&s;ert of her Crime, for look|ing back upon <HI>Sodom,</HI> &s;he was turned into a <HI>Pillar of Salt.</HI>&mdash;By this we may learn, That there is more Evil
<PB N="45" REF="003029_0047_0FEFAF106F400220">
in every Sin, than Men are aware of: It is more di&s;|plea&s;ing to the <HI>holy GOD</HI> than we can imagine it to be: GOD'S Thot's of Sin are not as Man's; his ac|count of it and Man's are very different. The Infi|nite Being again&s;t whom Sin is committed, and who only knows the Malignity &amp; Demerit of it, does not make light of the &s;malle&s;t Sin. <HI>The Wages of</HI> every <HI>Sin is Death.</HI> And the righteous GOD, to &s;hew his Hatred of Sin, and what a heavy Puni&s;hment it de|&s;erves, &s;ometimes in this World remarkably executes Vengeance upon Men, for tho&s;e Faults, which to a common Eye appear &s;mall &amp; incon&s;iderable. He that turned <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife into a Pillar of Salt, for looking back on <HI>Sodom,</HI> &s;truck <HI>Uzzah</HI> dead, for touching the Ark; and &s;mote the Men of <HI>Beth&s;heme&s;h</HI> Fifty Thou|&s;and, three&s;core and ten, for looking into it. <HI>Behold therefore the &s;everity of God: on them which fell &s;everity,</HI> Rom. 11.22.&mdash; Jer. 2.19. <HI>Know therefore and &s;ee, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, &s;aith the Lord God of ho&s;ts.</HI>&mdash; On the <HI>Pillar of Salt</HI> is engraven the De&s;ert &amp; Doom of every Sinner among&s;t us, and <HI>He that runs may read it. Lot</HI>'s Wife is thus &s;et forth for an Example, &s;hewing to us what we de&s;erve for our Rebellion, Athei&s;m, Unbelief, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and Contempt of GOD'S Mercy. Was <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife a greater Sinner than You, or I? They are not always the greate&s;t offenders, on whom GOD inflicts the mo&s;t vi&s;ible Judgments in this World, See <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.1, 2, 3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We &s;hou'd look upon the Pillar of Salt, that our Fle&s;h may tremble for fear of GOD, and that we may be afraid of his Judg|ments. The De&s;ert of Sin is &s;till the &s;ame, and GOD is immutably and impartially Ju&s;t; what he hath done to others, he may do to us. It is certain, that unle&s;s our Repentance prevent, GOD'S Wrath will fall upon us, if not in &s;uch a manner, yet as terribly as it did upon <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife: and as it will be more tolerable for <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp; <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> &s;o it will for <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife in the Day of Judgment, than for us, if we continue to neg|lect &amp; de&s;pi&s;e the great Mercy of GOD in &s;ending his

Angel, the Lord JESUS, to deliver us from the Lake that burns with Fire &amp; Brim&s;tone.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE &s;hou'd remember the Puni&s;hment of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, and be convinced of the <HI>Folly and Danger of &s;inning in Secret.</HI></P>
<P>SHE looked back from behind <HI>Lot,</HI> &s;o that he could not ob&s;erve and reprove her; but &s;he was before GOD, did that Evil in His &s;ight, and He rebuk'd her in His Anger. GOD'S Judgments will &s;ooner or later find Men out in their mo&s;t &s;ecret Sins, Zeph. 1.12. <HI>I will &s;earch Jeru&s;alem with candles, and puni&s;h the men that are &s;ettled on their lees; that &s;ay in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</HI> There is no darkne&s;s, nor &s;hadow of Death, in which the workers of Iniquity can hide them&s;elves from his Eyes, which are as a flame of Fire. If we are Religious &amp; Pray in Secret, our gracious Father in Hea|ven will reward us openly: But if we are Wicked, and Sin in Secret, our righteous Judge will puni&s;h us openly; if not in this World, yet &s;adly in that which is to come. Wo unto their Soul, who declare their Sin as <HI>Sodom,</HI> and hide it not: Wo al&s;o unto theirs, who conceal their Sin as <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, for GOD will reveal it, and reckon with them for it.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE &s;hou'd remember <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wive's Puni&s;hment, and not de&s;ire, nor delight in the <HI>forbidden Society of vicious Per&s;ons, le&s;t we be involved in their Ruin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>LOT</HI>'s Wife lingered in, and look'd back upon <HI>Sodom,</HI> wi&s;hing (mo&s;t probably) that &s;he might en|joy the Company of her Friends &amp; Acquaintance there; and therefore &s;he &s;uffer'd with them. GOD's exemplary Vengeance was poured down on her at the &s;ame time, that it was on them; and it is probable in the &s;ame manner. Fire &amp; Brim&s;tone might be rained on her, as well as on them. A judicious Divine thus expounds that Text, Gen. 19.24. <HI>The Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah, brim&s;tone &amp; fire;</HI> that is, He con&s;umed them by Thunder &amp; Lightning. Which (&s;aith he) &s;ome of the Pagans had notice of, for <HI>Taci|tus</HI> tells us, that tho&s;e Cities were &s;et on fire and burnt up by the &s;troke of Thunder. <HI>He adds,</HI> The
<PB N="47" REF="003029_0049_0FEFAF163392E180">
Saline Pillar which <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife was turned into, was probably the Effect of this wonderful Meteor; for from &s;everal Examples it appears, that Per&s;ons &s;truck with Thunder have continued in the &s;ame Po&s;ture wherein they were when they were alive, and their dead Bodies are &s;tiffned by the &s;ulphurious Va|pours penetrating them. But whether <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife was &s;truck dead with a fla&s;h of that Fire which burned <HI>Sodom</HI> or not, yet &s;he was de&s;troyed with that wicked People; and as <HI>Sodom</HI> was turned into a Lake, Heaps and Pits of Salt <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 14.3. <HI>Deut</HI> 29.23. <HI>Zeph.</HI> 2.9.</NOTE>, &s;o <HI>Lot</HI>'s, Wife was turned into a <HI>Pillar of Salt.</HI> She partook of the &s;ame Cur&s;e. This is a Warning to us, not to hanker after the forbidden Society of lewd &amp; wicked Per&s;ons, le&s;t we be de&s;troyed with them. If we have fellow&s;hip with the unfruitful Works of Darkne&s;s, we &s;hall be led forth with the Workers of Iniquity. If our Life be now among the Unclean, we may expect &s;oon to have our part with them in the Lake which burneth with Fire &amp; Brim|&s;tone, Rev. 18.4. <HI>I heard another voice from Heaven, &s;aying, Come out of her, my People, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. WE &s;hou'd remember the Puni&s;hment of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, that &s;udden De&s;truction from <HI>GOD</HI> may be a <HI>Terror</HI> to us.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife looked back, &s;he immediately became a <HI>Pillar of Salt:</HI> She was &s;truck dead in a moment. This in&s;tance of GOD'S Wrath &s;hou'd make us &s;en&s;ible how obnoxious we are to &s;udden De&s;tructi|on. The Long-&s;uffering of GOD waited upon <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, while &s;he lingred in <HI>Sodom;</HI> but when &s;he looked back, his Wrath made quick work. GOD hath exer|cis'd great Patience toward us, yet he may bring &s;wift De&s;truction upon us, I&s;a. 42.13, 14. <HI>The Lord &s;hall go forth as a mighty man, he &s;hall &s;tir up jealou&s;y like a man of war: he &s;hall cry, yea, roar; he &s;hall pre|vail again&s;t his Enemies.

<P N="1">I. <HI>THAT while Men are in the Corrupt</HI> State of Nature, <HI>they are my&s;tically in</HI> Sodom.</P>
<P>THEY are in &s;uch a Condition as <HI>Sodom</HI> was an Emblem of.

<P N="1">1. UNCONVERTED Sinners may be fitly &s;aid to be in <HI>Sodom,</HI> in regard of that <HI>Pollution</HI> which they wallow in</P>
<P><HI>SODOM</HI> was a <HI>Sink</HI> of moral Pollution, in which the People like Swine did wallow: and &s;o it repre|&s;ented the Corrupt State of Nature, in which the Children of Men are altogether filthy.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid, Gen. 13.13.

Original Sin is greater than all the
<PB N="52" REF="003029_0054_0FEFAF2227AB3660">
actual Abominations that were committed in <HI>Sodom. Sodom</HI> was a <HI>Sink,</HI> but corrupt Nature is a <HI>Foun|tain</HI> of moral Defilements: And there is more filthy Water in this Fountain, than ever i&s;&s;ued forth in the impure &s;treams of <HI>Sodom.</HI> The Fountain did not ca&s;t out all it's dirty Waters, even in that &s;o defiled Land. Altho' that People did <HI>draw iniquity with cords of vanity and &s;in as it were with a rope,</HI> yet they did not draw the Fountain dry. But as the Streams di&s;cover what the Fountain is, &s;o the abomi|nable Wickedne&s;s in <HI>Sodom,</HI> &s;heweth to us what the Corruption of our fallen Nature is. And tho&s;e who are in the State of Polluted Nature, are in re&s;pect thereof more filthy &amp; de&s;perately wicked, than the People of <HI>Sodom,</HI> were in re&s;pect of the actual Abominations which prevailed in it. They dwell amid&s;t greater Impurities, than tho&s;e which were vi&s;ible, and did openly abound in <HI>Sodom.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is this remarkable difference between <HI>Sodom</HI> and a State of Nature; It was po&s;&s;ible for a Man to be Righteous in the former, but it is not &s;o in the latter. Indeed, there were not ten righteous Per&s;ons to be found in <HI>Sodom,</HI> when the LORD came down to &s;ee whether the People had done altogether according to the Cry that went up to him; yet there was One good Man that lived in it at that time; <HI>Ju&s;t Lot, vexed,</HI> and &s;o not corrupted, <HI>with the filthy conver&s;ation of the wicked there: For that righteous man dwelling among them, in &s;eeing and hearing, vexed his righte|ous &s;oul from day to day with their unlawful deeds,</HI> 2 Pet. 2.7, 8. It was po&s;&s;ible, tho' very difficult for one to live in <HI>Sodom,</HI> and not be infected with the Sins of that Place; but it is impo&s;&s;ible for one to abide in the State of Nature, and to be free from the Pol|lutions of it, Job 15.14. <HI>What is man that he &s;hould be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he &s;hould be righteous?</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible for him to be &s;o, till he is born of GOD, and there be a Change of his Heart and State.</P>

<P>Ob&s;. III. <HI>THAT in their flight from &s;piritual</HI> Sodom, <HI>Per&s;ons are apt to</HI> look back.</P>
<P><HI>LOT's</HI> Wife was brought without the City, and &s;he fled with him and her Daughters a while toward <HI>Zoar,</HI> and was in a fair way to e&s;cape the Ruin, which was then coming on the People of <HI>Sodom;</HI> But &s;he &s;lacken'd her Pace, linger'd behind, and looked back. This Sin of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife is imitated by many in their flight from <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Sodom: They are &s;o far awaken'd and wro't upon, that they abandon their vicious Practices, and &s;eem to be brought out of the State of polluted Nature; they turn their backs upon <HI>Sodom,</HI> and &s;et their faces towards <HI>Zion,</HI> and are in a fair way to e&s;cape the wrath of GOD: they run well for a time; take con&s;iderable Pains in Religion, &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate of Repentance &amp; Faith, labour to get

into CHRIST: perform holy Duties with much &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s, and apply them&s;elves to the Work of their Sal|vation with fear and trembling; and they are <HI>not far from the Kingdom of GOD:</HI> But they do not <HI>hold on,</HI> their Heat is &s;oon &s;pent, and they flag: Their dread of GOD'S Wrath, and concern for their Souls abate; good Impre&s;&s;ions wear off; and they meeting with Difficulties in the way of Salvation, grow weary of the Chri&s;tian Race, &s;tand &s;till, and <HI>look back</HI> &mdash;. They are tempted to think, there is no need of &s;o much Care about their Souls, that they were in no &s;uch Danger as they apprehended them to be; that the Fire &amp; Brim&s;tone which they were told of, and affrighted with, will not be rained upon them: The Love of the World and the things of it, revives in them; and they fancy it was never better with them, than when they were quiet and undi&s;turb'd in the Enjoyment of their outward Comforts, and &s;en&s;ual Delights; and &s;o thro' Unbelief, and Love of this World, they (as <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife did) <HI>look back</HI> with De|&s;ires of returning to their former Plea&s;ures. The State of &s;piritual Pollution and Bondage appears not &s;o bad to them, as when they were fir&s;t awaken'd to get out of it; nay, better than that of Holine&s;s, which they have been &s;triving to get into: As the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in their Journey to <HI>Canaan,</HI> thought that it was better with them in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and <HI>&s;aid one to another; let us make us a captain, and let us return into Egypt,</HI> Numb. 14.4. &mdash; They who &s;eem to have e&s;caped out of <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Sodom, and to have made con&s;iderable Progre&s;s toward <HI>Zion,</HI> do not ordinarily go back at once, but by degrees. They fir&s;t <HI>look back;</HI> they grow weary of Prayer, and other Duties, are le&s;s fre|quent and fervent therein: <HI>They &s;ay, Behold, what a wearine&s;s is it? and they bring the torn, the lame and &s;ick for an offering to the Lord;</HI> Their Minds hanker after their former Company and Delights: Temptations increa&s;e upon them daily, and they are more and more inclin'd to re&s;ume their abandon'd Lu&s;ts, and to renew their fellow&s;hip with the unfruitful Works of darkne&s;s. Having thus <HI>looked back,</HI> they

commonly (unle&s;s prevented by &s;udden De&s;truction) go back to <HI>Sodom;</HI> revert to their old Abominations. Prov. 26.11. <HI>As a Dog returneth to his vomit, &s;o a Fool returneth to his folly.</HI> This is cited by the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> and apply'd to the Apo&s;tates in his time, [O that it were not verified in many of us!] 2 Pet. 2.22. <HI>It is happened unto them according to the true Proverb, The Dog is turned to his own vomit, and the Sow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the mire.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;. IV. <HI>AWAKNED Sinners, in their flight from &s;piritual</HI> Sodom, <HI>&s;hould</HI> remember Lot's Wife, <HI>that &s;o they may be deter'd from</HI> looking back.</P>
<P>PERSONS may imitate the Sin, and incur the Puni&s;h|ment of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, tho' they do not attempt an E&s;cape out of my&s;tical <HI>Sodom:</HI> may be guilty of Di&s;obedience, Contempt of GOD'S All-&s;eeing Eye, of Unbelief, Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Ingratitude for the Mercy of GOD in offering to &s;ave them from the flames of Hell; and thereby may expo&s;e them&s;elves to &s;udden and &s;hame|ful De&s;truction: But &s;uch as have begun their flight from <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Sodom, (as I hope, &s;ome here pre&s;ent have,) if they look back, they e&s;pecially do imitate <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wives Sin, and may expect as terrible a Puni&s;h|ment as Her's: It is therefore peculiarly &s;ea&s;onable, and may be very profitable for tho&s;e who are endea|vouring to get out of <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Sodom, are &s;ollicitou&s;ly <HI>asking the way to Zion, with their faces thitherwards,</HI> and are flying from Wrath to come, to <HI>remember Lot's Wife. Look not behind</HI> you, le&s;t ye be con&s;umed&mdash; Will it not be as great a Sin in you, to <HI>look back,</HI> as it was in <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife? And may you not well be afraid of as great a Judgment, as that inflicted on her? If you <HI>look back,</HI> ye may become <HI>Pillars of Salt,</HI> Mo|numents of GOD'S &s;evere Ju&s;tice, Spectacles of Shame and everla&s;ting Reproach. If GOD doth not immedi|ately con&s;ume you, he may righteou&s;ly &s;mite you with Judicial Hardne&s;s; &s;eal you up to Ruin by final Ob|duration, letting you &s;tand a few Years more in this World, only as occa&s;ions to glorify his Power &amp; Wrath

upon you in the next. <HI>Theophilact</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife remain'd ob&s;tinate and impenitent, and her Heatt was hardned, and that this is the meaning of her being turned into a Pillar of Salt: Altho' his Interpretation of the Text is not to be embrac'd, yet it may be im|prov'd by tho&s;e who are in their flight from <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Sodom, to deter them from looking back, le&s;t in his &s;en&s;e they become Pillars of hardned Salt.</P>
<P>Zeph. 1.6. <HI>I will &s;tretch out my hand, and cut off them that are turned back.</HI> In the days of <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> wherein this Threatning was denounced, the &s;inful People of <HI>Judah</HI> were greatly awaken'd, &amp; outwardly Reformed: But they &s;oon revolted: Many that began well, &s;et out with Zeal in the good ways of the Lord, <HI>turned and looked back:</HI> GOD threatned them parti|cularly, that he would &s;tretch out his hand, and cut them off, wou'd be quick and &s;evere upon them. &mdash; Remember the words of CHRIST, Luk. 9.62. <HI>No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.</HI> Go through with the work that ye have begun, or ye &s;hall never enter into the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> Oh! Con&s;ider the Dan|ger and Mi&s;chief of <HI>looking back.</HI> If ye return to your former Abominations, the unclean Spirit will have a &s;tronger Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of you, than he had before, Matth. 12.43, 44, 45. <HI>When the unclean Spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh thro' dry places, &s;eeking re&s;t, and findeth none. Then he &s;aith, I will return into my hou&s;e from whence I came out, and when he is come, he findeth it empty, &s;wept, and garni&s;hed. Then goeth he, and taketh with him&s;elf &s;even other Spirits more wicked than him&s;elf, and they enter in and dwell there: and the la&s;t State of that man is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.</HI> This is well Expounded by the Apo&s;tle, 2 Pet. 2.20, 21. <HI>For if after they have e&s;caped the pollutions of the world, thro' the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they are again in|tangled therein, and overcome; the latter end is wor&s;e with them than the beginning. For it had been bet|ter for them not to have known the way of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,
<PB N="62" REF="003029_0064_0FEFAF3E9640AF90">
than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them.</HI></P>
<P>IF ye &s;hould be intangled again in your Lu&s;ts, and return to the Mire of your Sinful Pollutions, your E&s;cape, if ever it be attempted by you, will be far more difficult than it was at fir&s;t; your Deliverance out of Spiritual <HI>Sodom,</HI> will be almo&s;t de&s;paired of.&mdash; Ye having begun in the Spirit, be not &s;o fooli&s;h as to end in the fle&s;h. &mdash; If any of you have &s;lacken'd your pace, and are turning and drawing back, be convinc'd of your folly and danger, and quickned in your flight to CHRIST, by what ye now hear, &mdash; Gal. 5.7. <HI>Ye did run well, who did hinder you, that you &s;hould not obey the truth?</HI> &mdash; Renew your Re&s;olutions again&s;t Sin, and for Holine&s;s and Heaven: Lay a&s;ide every weight, and the Sin that doth &s;o ea&s;ily be&s;et you, and run with patience and per&s;eve|rence the Race &s;et before you: &mdash; and as ye run, <HI>Remember Lot's Wife.</HI></P>
