<HEAD>THE MIGHTY DESTROYER DISPLAYED, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>OBSERVING &s;ome years ago the dreadful havock made by the ex|ce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors in this part of the world, I was induced to in&s;ert in one of the almanacks an ex|tract of what had been written on that &s;ubject by Dr. Hales, fellow of the Royal Society, containing his own remarks, with the &s;entiments of &s;everal per&s;ons of note in the phy&s;ical way; who&s;e knowledge of the nature of di&s;tilled liquors, as well as of their effects on the human frame, be&s;t qualified them to give a right judgment thereon. And as the exce&s;&s;ive and indeed in&s;taken u&s;e of the&s;e liquors continues, and rather increa&s;es, on this Continent, 'tis thought a republication of tho&s;e &s;enti|ments,
<PB N="4" REF="042555_0003_101C75A7CB10A058">with &s;ome additions, may, thro' divine ble&s;&s;ing, be beneficial to many; particularly to &s;ome well minded people, who are under mi&s;taken prejudices on this mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubject. "My principal and indeed only motive," &s;ays this bene|volent author, <Q>is to endeavour to rou&s;e the caution and indignation of man|kind, again&s;t tho&s;e mighty de&s;troy|ers and deba&s;ers of the human &s;pecies, <HI>fermented di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors;</HI> tho&s;e wor&s;e than infernal &s;pirits, which bewitch and infatuate the nations with their &s;or|ceries.</Q> &mdash;An evil &s;o amazingly great, that did not woeful experience too fully prove it, it &s;eems incredible, that any whom it concerns could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o neg|ligent, as not to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endea|vours to &s;uppre&s;s this de&s;tructive <HI>man|bane.</HI></P>
<P>That eminent phy&s;ician Dr. Ho&s;&s;man expre&s;ly cautions again&s;t the u&s;e of di&s;til|led &s;pirituous liquors. "Becau&s;e," &s;ays he, <Q>they are, above all things, mo&s;t un|whole&s;ome, being cau&s;tic burning &s;pi|rits; which, by inflaming the &s;olids, and thickening the fluids, cau&s;e ob&s;tructi|ons, which bring on many fatal di&s;ca&s;es, &s;uch as hectick fevers, jaundice, drop&s;ies, &amp;c. whereby multitudes are yearly and daily de&s;troyed.</Q> He al&s;o
<PB N="5" REF="042555_0004_101C75AA6AF83A98">ob&s;erves, <Q>that they rot the entrails, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as the liver, &s;tomach and bowels; as it is evident, not only by opening the hodies of tho&s;e who are killed by drink|ing them, but al&s;o by what is ob&s;erved in Germany of the effect which the cau&s;tic, fiery, remaining wa&s;h of the di|&s;tillers, has on the guts of hogs; which are thereby &s;o tendered, that they can|not make puddings with them.</Q>&mdash;He farther ob&s;erves, <Q>That the fle&s;h of &s;uch hogs will not keep, even when &s;alted, &s;o well as the fle&s;h of other hogs.</Q> Dr. Cheyne, in his e&s;&s;ay of health and long life, &s;ays, <Q>All people, who have any re|gard to their health and lives, ought to tremble at the fir&s;t cravings for &s;uch poi&s;onous liquors. The maladies begot by them, bring forth nece&s;&s;ity upon ne|ce&s;&s;ity of drams and gills; till, at la&s;t, a kind drop&s;y, nervous convul&s;ion, flux, if not a fever, or phrenzy, &s;ets the poor &s;oul free. It has often rai&s;ed in me the mo&s;t melancholly reflections, to &s;ee the virtuous and &s;en&s;ible, bound in &s;uch chains and fetters, as nothing le&s;s than omnipotent grace or the unrelenting grave could relea&s;e them from.</Q></P>
<P>Doctor Short, in his hi&s;tory of mineral waters, page 225. &s;ays, <Q>The ofther I reflect on the mi&s;chief done by di&s;tilled
<PB N="6" REF="042555_0005_101C75AD2A652A28">&s;pirits, the more I am confirmed, that the human race had been happier had drams never been known: and I can|not help cordially joining with Doctor Allen, in his Synop&s;is Medici, A. 1633. <HI>That the plentiful devouring of tho&s;e &s;pirits has killed as many thou&s;ands of men, as there are &s;tars in the &s;ky. Nay, ten times ten thou&s;ands have died by the&s;e, more than all the re&s;t of the poi&s;ons what|ever.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Doctor Lind, in his treati&s;e on the &s;cur|vy, &s;ays, <Q>He ob&s;erved mo&s;t de&s;tructive di&s;tempers to be much increa&s;ed, even to mortality, by di&s;tilled &s;pirituous li|quors; which &s;ailors are too apt gree|dily to &s;wallow down.</Q> And Doctor Hales ob&s;erves, from the remarks made to him by an eminent &s;urgeon, <Q>That the &s;tomachs of great dram-drinkers were contracted into half the common natural &s;ize, and hard; &s;omewhat like leather, that had been held to the fire. The con&s;equence of which was, lo&s;s of appetite, and a wa&s;ting con&s;umption.</Q></P>
<P>It is pretended, that drams comfort, warm, and defend from the &s;everity of weather, to which men are &s;ometimes ex|po&s;ed; without which, they &s;ay, they &s;hould peri&s;h with cold; which is proba|bly, in a great mea&s;ure, true of tho&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="042555_0006_101C75AFCB57CB18">who are habituated to drink them; the blood of &s;uch being thereby &s;o much im|poveri&s;hed, that it is well known many of the drinkers of drams are cold and lifele&s;s in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, without frequent repetitions: this is what &s;ome of them have owned. But on the other hand, how much more able are &s;ober per|&s;ons to endure cold and hard&s;hips? their vital heat not being extingui&s;hed by in|temperance, does, by its kindly genial warmth, more effectually &s;ecure them from the inclemency of the weather, than the fal&s;e fla&s;h of a dram. Be&s;ides, it is well known, that men did not peri&s;h in the colde&s;t countries for want of drams formerly, when they were not to be had. Of the undoubted truth of this, Captain Ellis gives a full proof in the account of his voyage to Hud&s;on's Bay, page 199. Where he ob&s;erves, <Q>That the natives on the very cold coa&s;t, of that Bay, to whom the French are kinder than to &s;ell di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors, are tall, hardy, robu&s;t and active; whereas tho&s;e of them that are &s;upplied with drams from the Engli&s;h, are a meagre, dwarf|i&s;h, indolent people, hardly equal to the &s;everity of the country, and &s;ubject to many di&s;orders.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="042555_0007_101C75B2693CDAB0">
And as to the pernicious effects of &s;pi|rituous liquors in very hot climates, (as on the coa&s;t of Guinea) it is ob&s;erved, that the French and Portugue&s;e, who do not indulge in di&s;tilled &s;pirits, are healthy compared with the Engli&s;h; who, drink|ing freely of &s;pirits, &amp;c. die fa&s;t. Thus, al&s;o, it is ob&s;erved of the women in the We&s;t-Indies, that being &s;ober, they live long; but it is often otherwi&s;e with the men, who are more generally intempe|rate.</P>
<P>The unhappy dram-drinkers are &s;o ab|&s;olutely bound in &s;lavery to the&s;e infernal &s;pirits, that they &s;eem to have lo&s;t the power of delivering them&s;elves from this wor&s;t of bondage. How much then is it the bounden duty of tho&s;e, who have it in their power, to with-hold this de&s;truc|tive <HI>man-bane,</HI> either as parents, ma&s;ters, or rulers to the people committed to their tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Since then the evil is become &s;o noto|riou&s;ly epidemical as to debilitate and de|&s;troy multitudes, in mo&s;t parts of the world; it behoves all, who have any bow|els of pity for their fellow-creatures, more e&s;pecially the governors of the nations, as guardians and tender fathers, to guard the people committed to their charge from this <HI>mighty de&s;troyer.</HI> Can there be any
<PB N="9" REF="042555_0008_101C75B62CEEAF80">con&s;ideration, of &s;ufficient weight, to the contrary. Is it found policy to encourage vice in the people, becau&s;e a pre&s;ent re|venue ari&s;es from their debaucheries? Where will the revenue be, when the people, who &s;hould pay them, are de|&s;troyed? Are not a hardy, indu&s;trious healthy people, always found to be the mo&s;t able to contribute amply to the &s;up|port of government? And will not tem|perance, in the end, be found a more ef|fectual means to increa&s;e the real wealth and &s;trength of a nation, than to make drunkenne&s;s the cheape&s;t of vices? But if the con&s;ideration of the inhumanity of being in&s;trumental to the de&s;truction of multitudes, and in a manner, in &s;ome parts of the world, of whole nations, is not of weight enough to influence; yet, &s;ure, the awful con&s;ideration, that it mu&s;t needs be highly di&s;plea&s;ing to our merci|ful Creator, to have his favourite creature man thus deba&s;ed, di&s;graced, and de&s;troy|ed both in body and &s;oul, ought to have its due weight. Can it in rea&s;on be ex|pected, that he will always remain an un|concerned &s;pectator of of &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing proceedings? And will he not in mercy vi&s;it the nations for the&s;e things, to pre|vent the &s;till much greater ruin of future generations, in conformity to his u&s;ual
<PB N="10" REF="042555_0009_101C75B7B4B36CB0">method of proceeding, when irregulari|ties are arrived to great exce&s;&s;es? This di&s;ea&s;e has now attained to &s;o enormous a pitch, that it is much to be feared no|thing le&s;s than God's &s;evere fatherly cor|rection, will effectually cure it in many of the nations; who &s;eem as &s;upine and unconcerned about it, as if only &s;o many thou&s;ands of locu&s;ts were de&s;troyed there|by: for if in fifty or &s;ixty years this de|&s;tructive pe&s;t has &s;pread thus far and wide, how va&s;tly greater will the havock a|mong&s;t mankind be in an hundred years more, if &s;ome check be not put to its career?</P>
<P>If it had been &s;aid, an hundred years ago, to any of the rulers of the nations, that they &s;hould patiently, and even un|concernedly, &s;ee &s;uch multitudes of their &s;ubjects de&s;troyed both body and &s;oul, and that only for filthy lucre; would they not, with indignation, have &s;aid as Hazael did to Eli&s;ha, 2 Kings viii. 13. <Q><HI>But what is thy &s;ervant a dog, that he &s;hould do this great thing?</HI></Q> The plain truth is, that it is with the nations as it fre|quently happens to private per&s;ons, that when they grow gradually from bad to wor&s;e, they, at the &s;ame time, become more and more hardened, &s;o as to be even reconciled to practices for which they had
<PB N="11" REF="042555_0010_101C75BA93FA0F38">at fir&s;t the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation and abhor|rence; for familiarity takes away our at|tention, and robs things of their power to &s;trike &s;trongly upon us.</P>
<P>Though thou&s;ands and tens of thou|&s;ands peri&s;h every year by di&s;tilled &s;pi|rituous liquors, yet few appear to lay it effectually of heart, I mu&s;t here except the heads of the poor wild Indians, of the Six Nations &s;ituate back of New-York, and other parts of North-America, who being &s;en&s;ible of the great de&s;truction made a|mong&s;t them by di&s;tilled &s;pirituous li|quors, have long &s;ince, and do &s;till conti|nue, earne&s;tly to de&s;ire, that no &s;uch &s;pirit &s;hould be &s;old to their people. At a treaty held at Carli&s;le in this province, with the deputics of the Six Nations, the Dela|wares and other we&s;tern Indians, in the year 1753, Scarrooyady, one of the chiefs of the Six Nations, &s;peaking on behalf of all the Indians pre&s;ent, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the following effect, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>The rum ruins us: we beg you would prevent its coming in &s;uch quantities, by regu|lating the traders. We never under|&s;tood the trade was for whi&s;key <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;pirit made of grain.</NOTE> We de&s;ire it may be forbidden, and none
<PB N="12" REF="042555_0011_101C75BD64680D98">&s;old in the Indian country; but that if the Indians will have any, they may go among&s;t the inhabitants, and deal with them for it. When the&s;e whi&s;key tra|ders come, they bring thirty or forty cags, puts them down before us, and make us drink, and get all the &s;kins that &s;hould go to pay the debts we have contracted, for goods bought of the fair trader; and by the&s;e means, we not only ruin our&s;elves, but them too. The&s;e wicked whi&s;key &s;ellers, when they have once got the Indians in liquor, make them &s;ell their very clothes from their backs. In &s;hort, if this practice be continued, we mu&s;t be inevitably ruined. We mo&s;t earne&s;tly, therefore, be&s;eech you to remedy it.</Q> The Indian &s;peaker gave, as is u&s;ual with them in matters of moment, a treble &s;tring of wampum, in confirmation of this re|que&s;t. The de&s;tructive effect of di&s;tilled &s;pirits, have al&s;o extended their baneful influence among&s;t the people of Africa. It is, in a great mea&s;ure, through the in|troduction of tho&s;e infernal &s;pirits, that the poor negroes have been as it were bewitched, and prevailed upon to capti|vate their unhappy country people, in or|der to bring them to the European mar|ket: hence deva&s;lation, blood&s;hed and mi|&s;ery
<PB N="13" REF="042555_0012_101C75C140F29978">have &s;pread in their land; many thou|&s;ands, and hundreds of thou&s;ands, have been doomed to a mi&s;erable thraldom ; and many, very many, brought to a cru|el and untimely end: innumerable in|&s;tances might be mentioned, to confirm this melancholy truth; of which I &s;hall mention two, <HI>viz.</HI> Andrew Brue, the noted French factor, who re&s;ided &s;ixteen years in Guinea, tells us, <Q>That, in ge|neral, brandy is the be&s;t commodity among&s;t the negroes, as they love it to exce&s;s: that it is ea&s;y, from hence, to e&s;timate the va&s;t profit made by the company, when its &s;tore-hou&s;e is well provided with this liquor.</Q> And Fran|cis Moor, the Engli&s;h factor, in his ac|count of Africa, &s;ays, <Q>That it was to the king of Bar&s;ailly's in&s;atiable thir&s;t for brandy, that his &s;ubjects freedom and families were in &s;o precarious a &s;i|tuation,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is no uncommon thing for habitual rum-drinkers, when a &s;it of &s;ickne&s;s comes on, which they conclude will be their la&s;t, to de&s;ire to have plenty of rum by them; by which means, they continue intoxi|cated till death: to &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing and de|plorable a &s;otti&s;h condition have they re|duced them&s;elves! This is a ca&s;e &s;o cala|mitous to mankind, that to have a tho|rough
<PB N="14" REF="042555_0013_101C75C2CA9C6288">&s;en&s;e of it, and yet not to remon|&s;trate, nor earne&s;tly caution again&s;t it, is certainly as criminal as it is unfriendly not to warn a blind per&s;on of a danger|ous precipice or pit; yet, alas! how un|concerned are the greate&s;t part of man|kind at this mo&s;t enormous ruin of mul|titudes! In trials for life, what diligence is u&s;ed to &s;ind the occa&s;ion of the lo&s;s of one &s;ubject! What care will not a faith|ful phy&s;ician be&s;tow for the pre&s;ervation of one life! How did the wi&s;e Romans honour him, who &s;aved the life of one Roman citizen! But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it is not one, nor one hundred, nor one thou&s;and, but probably no le&s;s than a million that peris;h, yearly, by this wor&s;t of plagues. How then dare the gover|nors of nations be unconcerned or &s;ilent in a cau&s;e in which humanity, virtue, and the real welfare of mankind, both civil and religious, are &s;o deeply concerned? A cau&s;e, which tends not only to the weakening the faculties, enervating the bodies of men, but al&s;o in deba&s;ing the &s;pecies, and &s;hortening the lives of mul|titudes.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t afflictive and dreadful ef|fect of the common u&s;e of di&s;tilled &s;piritu|ous liquors, are, that it not only height|ens the pa&s;&s;ions of men and depraves their
<PB N="15" REF="042555_0014_101C75C5B3E552F8">morals; but what is in&s;initely wor&s;e, and ought to be <HI>an awakening</HI> con&s;ideration, they become prophane and abandoned, and to the la&s;t degree regardle&s;s of their duty to God and man; the feelings of the mind are gradually benumb'd, and an in|&s;en&s;ibility to the healing in&s;luence of reli|gion en&s;ues.</P>
<P>The Almighty who has &s;o curiou&s;ly wrought our wonderful frame out of the du&s;t, knowing how prone we are to di&s;|order it by irregularities, hath of his ten|der fatherly care of us, not only implant|ed in us a &s;trong de&s;ire of life and &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation, but has al&s;o &s;triclly warned us to avoid all de&s;tructive irregularities and vices, and to practi&s;e tho&s;e virtues which are &s;o well adapted to our nature, that they have a direct tendency to give health to the &s;oul, as well as marrow to the bones, Prow. cxi. 8. Yet how is this delicate, this curiou&s;ly wrought frame, abu&s;ed and di&s;ord red by repeated irre|gularities of many kinds, but never be|fore to the enormous degree that it has of late years arrived at by the exce&s;&s;ive abu&s;e of the&s;e formented, di&s;tilled &s;piritu|ous liquors, which, by their mi&s;chievous effects, &s;eem to claim Satan him&s;elf for their author. The benevolent author fir&s;t men|tioned from who&s;e collection great part of
<PB N="16" REF="042555_0015_101C75C8508C5018">the foregoing is collected, ob&s;erves, <Q>That if any of his readers &s;hould think the &s;ubject is overpre&s;&s;ed, &s;uch are de&s;ired to con&s;ider that the calamitous urgency of the ca&s;e ab&s;olutely requireth the mo&s;t pathetical expo&s;tulation, to rou&s;e the attention and indignation of mankind, again&s;t this greate&s;t of all plagues that ever befel unhappy man, which is both our &s;in and our mo&s;t &s;evere puni&s;h|ment.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Cheyne farther ob&s;erves, <Q>That if only the profligate, the &s;coundrel, the abandoned run into the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, it were as vain to endeavour to reclaim them, as it were to &s;top a tempe&s;t, or calm a &s;torm: But that now the vice is become epidemical, &s;ince it has got not only among mechanics and trade&s;|men, but among perions of the bright|e&s;t, but among perions of the bright|e&s;t genius, the fine&s;t ta&s;te, and the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed parts. And oh! that I could (adds the doctor) give my con|&s;cience the lye in not mentioning them, even among the fir&s;t and lea&s;t fallen part of the creation it&s;elf, and tho&s;e of them too, of the mo&s;t elegant parts end the &s;tricte&s;t virtuc, even of tho&s;e who are in other re&s;pects blamele&s;s. Since the ca&s;e is &s;o, it will not be ami&s;s to &s;hew, to the evidence of a demon|&s;tration,
<PB N="17" REF="042555_0016_101C75CB00F2C858">&s;tration, the folly as well as fruitle&s;t|ne&s;s of &s;uch a cour&s;e. A fit of the colick, or of the vapours; a family misfortune: the death of a child, or of a friend, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the nurfe or the next neighbour, often gives ri&s;e and becomes the weighty cau&s;es of &s;o fatal an effect. A little lowne&s;s requires drops, which pa&s;s readily down under the notion of phy&s;ic: Drops beget drams, and drams beget more drams, till they come to be without weight and without mea&s;ure&mdash;did this bewitching poi&s;on ac|tually cure or relieve them from time to time, &s;omething might be &s;aid to ex|tenuate the folly and the frenzy of &s;uch a cour&s;e, but on the contrary, it height|ens and enrages all their &s;ymptoms and &s;ufferings ever afterwards, excepting the few moments immediately after taking it down; and every dram be|gets the nece&s;tity of two more to cure the ill effects of the fir&s;t, and one mi|nute's indulgence they purcha&s;e with many hours of greater pain and mi&s;e|ry, be&s;ides making the malady more incurable. Low &s;piritedne&s;s it&s;elf is no di&s;ea&s;e; be&s;ides there are remedies that will relieve it &s;o long as there is any oil remaining in the lamp.&mdash;Exerci&s;e, ab&s;tinence and proper evacuations, with
<PB N="18" REF="042555_0017_101C75CDB2554CB8">time and patience, will continually make it tolerable; very often they will perfectly cure. The running into drams is giving up the whole at once, for neither laudanum nor ar&s;enick will kill more certainly, altho' more quickly.</Q></P>
<P>The mi&s;taken u&s;e and grievous abu&s;e of rum and other di&s;tilled &s;pirits, perhaps in no ca&s;e appear more palpably than at the time of harne&s;t, a bu&s;ine&s;s which, under the Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen&s;ation, was par|ticularly enjoined to be carried on with humiliation and thank&s;giving, and ought by all means, to be ob&s;erved as &s;uch under the go&s;pel; but through the abu&s;e of &s;pi|rituous liquors, is made an occa&s;ion of a greater abu&s;e of the creature and di&s;honour of the Creator; this ari&s;es, in many, from a mi&s;taken per&s;ua&s;ion that hard labour, particularly that of the harve&s;t field, can|not be carried on without a quantity of rum or other di&s;tilied &s;pirits; and in &s;up|port of this opinion, we are frequently told of the many people who have died in the field through extream heat and fa|tigue, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that many more would die, if a plentiful u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors was not allowed. But this I am per&s;uaded is a great mi&s;take, it being much more likely that the free u&s;e of rum occa|&s;ioned the death of tho&s;e people; the
<PB N="19" REF="042555_0018_101C75D04FAEE868">quantity they had &s;wallowed down, &s;end|ing a greater flow of &s;pirits into the head than the &s;trength of the body could &s;up|port. Indeed the repeated large quantities of rum commonly drank during the whole time of harve&s;t, keeps up the blood in a continual ferment and &s;ever, in which &s;tate people cannot have a proper re&s;tora|tive &s;leep; their con&s;titutions are thereby onervated, their lives &s;hortened, and an unfitne&s;s for religious impre&s;&s;ions general|ly prevails.</P>
<P>The&s;e mo&s;t &s;olemn and weighty con&s;i|derations, have induced &s;ome well mind|ed people to endeavour to lead, by their examples, their friends and neighbours into a contrary practice; and under the&s;e attempts, experience has made in manife&s;t, that very little or no &s;trong liquor is ne|ce&s;&s;ary at tho&s;e times; indeed they have been convinced that the harve&s;t and other laborious work, can be very well manag|ed without making u&s;e of any &s;pirituous liquors at all. If &s;uch labour was carried on with &s;teadine&s;s and proper moderation, there would certainly be no need of a re|cruit of &s;trength being &s;ought for by that means; more frequent intervals of re&s;t, with a little food, oftener allowed the reapers, and &s;mall drinks; &s;uch as mola&s;|&s;es and water made agreeable with a little
<PB N="20" REF="042555_0019_101C75D4467DE938">cyder, &s;mall beer, or even milk and wa|ter, would fully enable them to perform their work to their employer's &s;atisfaction and their own advantage; and the over|plus wages they would receive, in&s;tead of the &s;pirituous liquors u&s;ually given, might be &s;u&s;ticient to purcha&s;e bread for their families.</P>
<P>This &s;ober and moderate manner of pro|ceeding was certainly the general practice in this province, for a con&s;iderable num|ber of years after its fir&s;t &s;ettlement, when but &s;mall quantities of &s;trong liquors, and often none at all could be procured <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a printed oration, not long &s;ince pronounced by Dr. Ru&s;h, before the Philo&s;ophical Society of this city, we are told at page 65, <Q>Some of you may remember the time, and your fathers have told tho&s;e of us who do not, when the di&s;ea&s;es of Penn&s;ylvania were as few and as &s;imple as tho&s;e of the Indians.

And from the too apparent general u&s;e, there is
<PB N="22" REF="042555_0021_101C75D871785A38">no room to &s;uppo&s;e but that it has gone on in an increa&s;ed proportion to our numbers; tho' not now &s;o ea&s;ily a&s;certained, from the additional numbers of ports, and va|rious means of procuring it: Nor ought we to omit, in &s;uch accounts, the large quantities of whi&s;ky and other liquors di&s;|tilled among&s;t our&s;elves from grain, fruit, and mola&s;&s;es, which cannot well be calcu|lated.</P>
<P>I have heard of &s;everal thoughtful peo|ple who, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that the com|mon method of giving &s;pirituous liquors to labourers was exceeding hurtful, have made it a condition with tho&s;e they have employed, not to u&s;e any &s;pirituous liquors in their fields; the&s;e have had their work performed to good &s;atisfaction, and with|out any damage en&s;uing to their labour|ers. Nay, where they have remained any con&s;iderable time with &s;uch employers, they have generally acknowledged them|&s;elves &s;en&s;ible of the benefit ari&s;ing from having thus totally refrained the u&s;e of tho&s;e liquors. A particular in&s;tance of this kind occurred la&s;t &s;ummer, in the ca&s;e of Jo&s;hua Evans, of Haddonfield; this con&s;iderate per&s;on being convinced that the u&s;e of rum and other &s;pirituous liquors, was extreamly hurtful to the la|bouring people; more e&s;pecially during
<PB N="23" REF="042555_0022_101C75DA00D14A20">the time of harve&s;t, apprehended it to be his duty, to become an example in oppo|&s;ition to this pernicious cu&s;tom; and he concluded to run all ri&s;ques of lo&s;s and da|mage, which might happen to him&s;elf by the delay of bringing in his harve&s;t, ra|ther than comply with a cu&s;tom which he apprehended to be &s;o de&s;tructive of his fellow <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>He therefore offered &s;ix-pence per day more than other farmers, to &s;uch labour|ers as were willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing in his harve&s;t, on condition that no &s;piritu|ous liquors &s;hould be u&s;ed in his fields. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;ingularity of &s;uch a propo&s;al, a &s;ufficient number of labour|ers offered them&s;elves, to whom he re|marked, That the hurrying manner in which the people drove on their labour in the harve&s;t field, cau&s;ed an unnatural fer|ment and heat in their bodies, and of cour&s;e an exce&s;&s;ive thir&s;t en&s;ued, which often occa&s;ioned their drinking water, or &s;mall liquors, in &s;uch immoderate degree as to become hurtful and very dangerous, that this was generally a&s;&s;igned as a per|&s;on for the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors: That, in order to avoid the&s;e extremes, he propo&s;ed to lead them him&s;elf in the harve&s;t work, de&s;iring they would go no fa&s;ter than he did; they acted according|ly,
<PB N="24" REF="042555_0023_101C75DDC30FA160">and his corn was cut down and brought in as well, if not better, than ever it had been before; and tho' the people drank little but water or milk and water, chu&s;ing it rather than cyder and water, or &s;mall beer, which they were not u&s;ed to; they went thro' their bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;atisfaction to him and them&s;elves. This per&s;on has pur&s;ued the &s;ame cour&s;e with labourers he has hired for other work; who, tho' ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;pirituous liquors, after having &s;erved him &s;everal days, have frankly ac|knowledged they had done very well <HI>with|out them,</HI> finding them&s;elves in a better &s;tate both of body and mind, than when they began to work for him.</P>
<P>This is a plain in&s;tance in contradiction to the common prejudice, that labouring people cannot with &s;afety perform their work without u&s;ing tho&s;e liquors. Seve|ral more examples might be in&s;tanced of &s;ome con&s;iderate people who have made it a rule not to make any u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, either among&s;t their workmen in the pro&s;ecution of their trades, or on their plantations.

<P>It is well known that a pint of good mo|la&s;&s;es will, in di&s;tillation, afford rather more than a pint of good proof rum; therefore mu&s;t contain as much, if not more real &s;trength than the &s;ame quantity of rum, without any of its noxious qualities; be|ing then in the &s;tate the Almighty fir&s;t formed it, the fiery property &s;o clothed and united with the earthy and bal&s;amick parts, as to cau&s;e it to be quite friendly to our nature, and not liable to intoxicate; as the &s;pirit alone will, when &s;eparated by di&s;tillation from the other parts.</P>

<P>Among&s;t the &s;everal prejudices in fa|vour of the mi&s;taken u&s;e of &s;pirituous li|quors, there is none gives it a greater &s;anction or &s;upport, than the prevailing opinion, even with per&s;ons of reputation, that what they term a moderate quantity of rum mixed with water, is the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t liquor that can be drank; hence con&s;irming it, that &s;pirit in one form
<PB N="28" REF="042555_0027_101C75E9ABF3BD50">or other is nece&s;&s;ary. To &s;uch who have not been accu&s;tomed, and think they can|not habituate them&s;elves to drink water, there may appear to be &s;ome kind of plea in this argument, e&s;pecially to travellers, who often meet with beer, cyder, or other fermented liquors that are dead, hard, &s;our, or not properly fermented, which tend to generate air in the bowels, pro|ducing colicks, &amp;c. But I believe if tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;uffered the weight of the &s;ubject, and the con&s;equence of the encourage|ment they thereby give to the u&s;e of the&s;e de&s;tructive &s;pirits, to take proper place with them, it might &s;ugge&s;t the proprie|ty, if not nece&s;&s;ity, of introducing a more &s;alutary practice to them&s;elves and fami|lies. That pure fluid (water) which the benevolent father of the family of man|kind points out for general u&s;e, is &s;o ana|logous to the human frame, that except in a very few ca&s;es, people might with &s;afety gradually u&s;e them&s;elves to it: And as to &s;uch well di&s;po&s;ed people who &s;till retain a favourable opinion for the u&s;e of &s;pirit mixed with water, ought they not, even from love to mankind, to endeavour to refrain from, and example others a|gain&s;t it, (on account of the prodigious havock made by the u&s;e of &s;pirits) agree|able to the example &s;et us by the Apo&s;tle

<P>Doctor Short, in his di&s;cour&s;e of the inward u&s;e of water, &s;peaks much in its commendation.

Of this the common people among&s;t the Highlands of Scotland, are a &s;u&s;&s;icient in&s;tance, among&s;t whom it is no rarity to find per&s;ons of eighty, ninety, yea an hundred years of age, as healthy, &s;trong, and nimble, as wine or ale bibbers are at thirty-&s;ix or forty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was informed by a per&s;on of credit, from his own ob&s;ervations in Scotland, of the &s;trength and hardine&s;s of the common people there; and of their ability to bear cold and fatigue; tho' the cold is great in winter, and their &s;upport in &s;ome parts principally, if not wholly when abroad confined to oatmeal and water; he has &s;een a &s;hepherd laid down to re&s;t on &s;leep on the mountain, without any &s;helter, wrapt up in his plaid in cold &s;nowy weather, &s;uch as would have froze mo&s;t other people.</NOTE> The excellency of

Of this the Per&s;ian, Grecian, and Roman monarchies are in&s;tances. This was al&s;o the ca&s;e of our ance&s;tors, the Saxons, Danes, and Normans, whil&s;t their manners remained &s;imple, and their food and drink &s;uch as nature had provided, they encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that their country not be|ing able to contain them, they were oblig|ed to &s;end out &s;warms of people to &s;eek for &s;ettlements in the more &s;outhern parts of the world; the&s;e gradually &s;ettled them|&s;elves in the different parts of the Roman empire: But &s;ince tho&s;e Northern King|doms have for&s;aken the whol&s;ome cu&s;toms of their forefathers, and habituated them|&s;elves to the u&s;e of &s;trong liquors, they are &s;o enfeebled, and their numbers have &s;o much decrea&s;ed, that many parts of
<PB N="33" REF="042555_0032_101C75F6261D1480">their own country now remain unculti|vated. The rulers ea&s;y under the pecuni|ary advantages which ari&s;e, them&s;elves en|&s;laved to the practice of drinking to exce&s;s, look without concern on this enormous ruin of multitudes of their fellow men. Thus it is in Ru&s;&s;ia, where a va&s;t revenue is rai&s;ed from di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors, and a multitude of people proportionably large, are de&s;troyed thereby. Again &s;ays the doctor, <Q>There is a ridiculous maxim u&s;ed by drinkers, that water makes but thin blood, not fit for bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;I &s;ay it is water only that can endue its drinkers with the &s;tronge&s;t bodies and mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titutions, where exerci&s;e or labour is joined with it, &s;ince it be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ts the &s;to|mach and lungs to reduce the aliments into the &s;malle&s;t particles, that they may better pa&s;s the &s;trainers of the body, which &s;eparates the nutritious parts of the blood to be applyed to the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;els, and exerci&s;e invigorates the fibres and mu&s;cles; whereas the rapid motion of the blood excited by drinking &s;pirituous li|quors, can not fail of being prejudicial to the body, it will cau&s;e the watery parts to di&s;&s;ipate and the remaining grow thick and tough, and the event be ob&s;tructions, inflammations, impo&s;thumations, &amp;c.&mdash; and tho' &s;trong liquors afford a greater

In this we are confirmed, if we con&s;ider the great &s;trength and hardine&s;s of poor ru&s;ticks in many parts of the world, who&s;e provi|&s;ions is mo&s;tly vegetable food, and their drink water." The doctor adds, "That it often happens that per&s;ons of tender, weakly, crazy con&s;titutions, by refrain|ing &s;trong liquors and accu&s;toming them|&s;elves to drink water, make &s;hift to &s;pin out many years.</Q></P>

If any gnawing be left in the &s;tomach upon quite leaving it off, a little warm broth, weak tea, or any thing of that kind, will be of &s;ervice. The appetite always increa&s;es in a few days after leaving off drams, unle&s;s by the too long continuance of them, the tone of the &s;tomach is de&s;troyed.

<P>THE great rule of diet is to &s;tudy &s;implicity: Nature delights in the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple food; and every animal, except man, follows her dictates.</P>
<P>Nothing conduces more to health and long life, than ab&s;tinence and plain food, with due labour.</P>
<P>Water alone is &s;ufficient and effectual for all the purpo&s;es of human want in drink: It is the univer|&s;al di&s;&s;olvent nature has provided, and the mo&s;t cer|tain diluter of all bodies proper for food; quickens the appetite and &s;trengthens dige&s;tion mo&s;t. Doctor Cheyne and doctor Cadogan.</P>
<P>Strong and &s;pirituous liquors were never de&s;igned for common u&s;e: They were formerly kept in Eng|land, as other medicines are, in apothecaries &s;hops: If freely indulged, they become a certain tho' &s;low poi&s;on. Cheyne.</P>
<P>All intoxicating liquors may be con&s;idered as poi|&s;ons; however di&s;gui&s;ed, that is their real charac|ter, and &s;ooner or later they will have their effect. Doctor Buchan.</P>

<P>Fevers occa&s;ioned by drinking, do not always go off in a day, they frequently end in an inflammation of the brea&s;t, liver, or brain, and produce fatal effects.</P>
<P>There is no danger in leaving off drinking &s;trong liquours at once, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for continuing them being fal&s;e and groundle&s;s. Cheyne.</P>

<P>Many imagine that hard labour could not be &s;up|ported without drinking &s;trong liquors. This tho' a common, is a very erroneous opinion: Men who ne|ver ta&s;ted &s;trong liquors, are not only able to endure more fatigue, but al&s;o live much longer than tho&s;e who u&s;e them daily. Buchan.</P>
<P>Every thing that has pa&s;t the fire, &s;o that it has had due time to divide and penetrate its parts, as in di&s;tillation, as far as it po&s;&s;ibly can, retains a cau&s;tic corro&s;ive and burning quality ever afterwards.</P>
<P>In the continued di&s;tilation of &s;pirits, the action of fire is &s;o &s;trong as to reduce them to liquid fire at la&s;t; which will of them&s;elves evaporate in vi&s;ible flames and &s;umes. Cheyne.</P>
<P>The great quantity of vi&s;cid malt liquor drank by the common people of England, cannot fail to ren|der the blood &s;izy and unfit for circulation, from whence proceed ob&s;tructions and inflammations of the lungs, &amp;c. Buchan.</P>
<P>Malt liquors (excepting clear &s;mall beer of due age) are extreamly hurtful to tender and &s;tudious per&s;ons. Cheyne.</P>
<P>There are few great ale drinkers who are not phthi&s;ical, nor is that to be wondered at, con&s;idering the glutinous and almo&s;t indige&s;tible nature of &s;trong ale. Buchan.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who drink ardent &s;pirits or &s;trong wines do not run le&s;s hazard; the&s;e liquors heat and inflame the blood, and tear the tender ve&s;&s;els of the lungs in pieces. Buchan.</P>
