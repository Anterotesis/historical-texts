<P N="1">&sect;. 1._THERE have appeared in the World &s;ome <HI>Humane Com|po&s;ures,</HI> which have been &s;o <HI>favoured,</HI> and perhaps <HI>flattered</HI> by Mankind, as to have it a&s;&s;erted concern|ing them, <HI>That no Mans Reproach could le&s;&s;en, and no Mans Applau&s;e could heighten, the Reputation which belong'd unto them.</HI> The A&s;&s;ertion may be made without Controver&s;y concern|ing the <HI>Divinely In&s;pired Book of</HI> PSALMS;
<PB N="ii" REF="001946_0003_0FFCAF23ADC45EA0">than which the Church of GOD is enriched with nothing more Glorious, among all its Incomparable Writings.</P>
<P>THE Commendations which the Ancients gave of this <HI>Unparallel'd Book,</HI> are as high, as the <HI>Tongue of Men</HI> can carry them; And the Commendations would not be too high, if the <HI>Tongue of Angels,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Writers of this Book, were employ'd for the giving of them. Let <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> alone be called in, to declare unto us the &s;en&s;e of all the re&s;t! <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom,</HI> who calls this wonderful Book, <HI>The Chri&s;tian Panoply;</HI> And <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> who Styles it, <HI>The Common Trea&s;ure of all Good Precepts,</HI> and, <HI>A Compleat Body of Divinity.</HI></P>
<P>THE PSALMS are in the Hebrew, divided into <HI>Five Books,</HI> like tho&s;e of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and &s;o they may be called, <HI>A Second Pentateuch.</HI> Yea, They are a &s;urprizing <HI>Epitome</HI> of all the Bible; For which cau&s;e, if we call the P&s;alter, <HI>A Little Bible,</HI> we &s;hall do no other than what <HI>Luther</HI> did before us. And &s;uch are the Excellent Vertues, in the <HI>Leaves</HI> of this <HI>Tree of Life</HI> which our God has granted for the <HI>Healing of the Nations,</HI> that, as <HI>Pro|clus</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> expre&s;&s;es the matter, <HI>To cure Heavine&s;s, to lay a&s;ide trouble &s;ome Thoughts and Pa&s;&s;ions, to ea&s;e us of our Cares, and recreate tho&s;e who are oppre&s;&s;ed with any,

<P>MELANCTHON &s;ays very truly, concern|ing the Book of PSALMS, <HI>That it is the mo&s;t elegant work extant in the World.</HI> It has indeed performed what <HI>Plato</HI> wi&s;h'd for, but what he thought <HI>meer Man</HI> could never come to: <HI>Plato,</HI> who &s;aw there was no way of In&s;truction &s;o efficacious, as that by <HI>Odes</HI> and <HI>Songs;</HI> but after all concludes, <HI>This mu&s;t be the work of GOD, or of a Man that &s;hall be full of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THERE have been profane, fooli&s;h, empty Pretenders to Literature, who have had no great Reli&s;h for the PSALMS of <HI>David.</HI> But with Men who have had a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e, a true gu&s;t of Things, no Writings in the World have been &s;o Reli&s;hed, as the&s;e matchle&s;s Gifts of Heaven unto the Children of Men.

&sect;. 2. THEODORET informs us, The Peo|ple in his time, were &s;o well acquainted with our PSALMS, that both in City and Coun|try it was the u&s;ual Employment of all Chri&s;tians, <HI>To Sing them:</HI> And even they who had little Acquantance, with any other Book of the Sacred Scriptures, yet &s;o had the PSALMS by heart, as to recreate them|&s;elves with Singing them in the <HI>Streets,</HI> and in the <HI>Fields,</HI> as well as in their <HI>Hou&s;es.</HI> And Verily, The&s;e marvellous Poems, have not by their <HI>Age</HI> lo&s;t any thing of their <HI>Spi|rit,</HI> or their <HI>Goodne&s;s.</HI> The Chri&s;tians in our days, may as well feed and live upon them, and <HI>Eat the Bread of Angels.</HI></P>
<P>THE Truth is, It was no ill Advice of <HI>Je|rom</HI> unto his Friend, That he would make the <HI>P&s;alter</HI> his <HI>Vade mecum,</HI> his con&s;tant Com|panion and Coun&s;ellor on all occa&s;ions. <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> Thou wilt find it &s;o marvellou&s;ly to an&s;wer all the occa&s;ions of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> that thou wilt commend the prudence of the Ancient <HI>Con&s;tantinopolitan,</HI> who being driven out of the City, took no part of his Trea|&s;ures but <HI>This,</HI> which unto him was, <HI>Pro et prae Divitjis,</HI> preferrible to all peri&s;hable Riches.</P>
<P>BEHOLD, A <HI>Prayer-Book</HI> which never had a <HI>Parallel.</HI> And tho' the very <HI>Words</HI> of this Book, may often &s;upply us with the be&s;t

<P>WHEN the <HI>Pardon of Sin</HI> is to be implored, the PSALMS will furni&s;h us, with the mo&s;t <HI>Pathetical Expre&s;&s;ions</HI> imaginable for that Grand Concern.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Graces</HI> of the <HI>New Creature,</HI> and the Di&s;po&s;itions of <HI>Piety</HI> are to be asked for, the PSALMS will not only furni&s;h us with <HI>Petitions</HI> for the&s;e <HI>Be&s;t of Ble&s;&s;ings,</HI> but in&s;en&s;ibly draw us in to the <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Ex|erci&s;e</HI> of them.</P>
<P>WHATEVER <HI>Maladies</HI> we find our Minds di&s;tempered withal, we may repair to the PSALMS as to a <HI>Di&s;pen&s;atory</HI> fill'd with the noble&s;t <HI>Remedies.</HI></P>
<P>Do our <HI>Invi&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le Enemies</HI> infe&s;t us with grievous <HI>Temptations?</HI> The Weapons and the Outcries we find in the PSALMS, again&s;t the vexatious Adver&s;aries, may be as efficaci|ou&s;ly as elegantly turned upon them. <HI>Davids</HI> Harp wi&s;ely introduced, will cau&s;e our <HI>Ene|mies
<PB N="vi" REF="001946_0007_0FFCAF310FD77B20">to turn back,</HI> the <HI>Evil-Spirits</HI> to retire before it.</P>
<P>WHEN we have our heavy <HI>Afflictions</HI> of many &s;orts lying upon us, what can we do better, than repair to the <HI>Songs,</HI> which <HI>GOD our Maker</HI> has <HI>given for the Night,</HI> in the PSALMS which we now have in our hands? We &s;hall not <HI>peri&s;h in our Afflictions,</HI> if we take the <HI>Delights</HI> here provided for us.</P>
<P>FINALLY, If we would be well in&s;tructed in the <HI>My&s;teries</HI> of the <HI>Great Salvation,</HI> or be well acquainted with the <HI>Prophecies</HI> of what is to be done in the <HI>Latter Days:</HI> Let the PSALMS be well &s;tudied. The true&s;t and the highe&s;t <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> is here to be met withal.</P>
<P>AND if in the Pro&s;ecution of the&s;e De|&s;igns, we add the method of <HI>Singing,</HI> which is the way to be <HI>filled with the Spirit,</HI> from whence the PSALMS are dictated, Behold, the <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> now put into a Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion for it, that we may <HI>in our Heart make Me|lody unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a Thing to be ob&s;erved, That <HI>all Nations</HI> make <HI>Singing,</HI> to be one part of the <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> which they pay unto their GOD. Thus <HI>All Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple walk even every one in the Name of his God;</HI> and thus we CHRISTIANS <HI>will walk in the Name of</HI> CHRIST <HI>who is the Lord our GOD,</HI> and who had directed us thus to do <HI>for ever and ever.</HI></P>

&sect;. 4. FOR the <HI>New Tran&s;lation</HI> of the PSALMS, which is here endeavoured, an <HI>Appeal</HI> may be with much A&s;&s;urance made, unto all that are Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Hebrew Tongue,</HI> whether it be not much more a|greeable to the <HI>Original,</HI> than the <HI>Old</HI> one, or than any that has yet been offered unto the World.

<P N="5">&sect;. 5. MOST certainly, our Tran&s;lation of the PSALMS, without the Fetters of <HI>Rhime</HI> upon it, can be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed no prejudice to the Character of <HI>Poetry</HI> in the perfor|mance. For indeed, however it is now ap|propriated, according to the true &s;en&s;e of the Term, to <HI>Rhythme</HI> it &s;elf a <HI>Similis De&s;i|nentia,</HI> or, a <HI>likene&s;s of &s;ound</HI> in the la&s;t Syllables of the Ver&s;e, is not e&s;&s;ential. Old <HI>Bede</HI> will give you &s;uch a Definition of <HI>Rhythme,</HI> and bring other Authorities be|&s;ides <HI>Au&s;tins</HI> for it, that <HI>Scaliger</HI> thereupon holds, all <HI>Ver&s;es</HI> wherein Regard is had unto the <HI>Number of Syllables,</HI> to have a claim unto it. Be that as the Criticks on the Term &s;hall plea&s;e, our <HI>Tran&s;lation</HI> is all in <HI>Metre;</HI> and really more tied unto <HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> than the <HI>Original</HI> appears to have been, by all the Ex|aminations that have as yet been employ'd upon it. For, however it might be with the Song of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> and with the
<PB N="xii" REF="001946_0013_0FFCAFE787466D40">Book of <HI>Job,</HI> and of the <HI>Proverbs;</HI> My in|comparable Ma&s;ter <HI>Al&s;ted</HI> allows me to &s;ay, That in the PSALMS, <HI>Nullum canticum &s;it metricis legibus a&s;trictum, &s;ed mera &s;oluta &s;it cratio, charactere Poetico animuta.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED, that Que&s;tion, <HI>To what Rules the Poe&s;y of the</HI> Davidic PSALMS <HI>is to be ad|ju&s;ted?</HI> has been as vexed a Problem to our <HI>Modern Criticks,</HI> as mo&s;t that they have med|dled with. It were endle&s;s to reckon up the &s;everal <HI>Methods</HI> wherein Learned Men have attempted an Account of the <HI>Hebrew Poe&s;y. Pfeiffer</HI> in his <HI>Dubia Vexota,</HI> has given us a Collection; Among which, that which <HI>Gomarus,</HI> has lit upon, looks as pro|bable as any: And yet, the Rules invented by that Author, are &s;o very lax, that you may according thereunto imagine, a Ver&s;o, in every Line of almo&s;t any Author in the World. I am therefore &s;trongly of the Opi|nion, That the <HI>Poe&s;ie</HI> of the Ancient <HI>Hebrews,</HI> knew no <HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> but that of the unknown <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> wherein it was to be accommodated. Our PSALMS in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> are not &s;o much <HI>Metrical</HI> as <HI>Mu&s;ical;</HI> And hence, the very In&s;criptions of them &s;ometimes inti|mate, that there was a &s;ort of <HI>Melody,</HI> unto which they were adapted. It is true, the <HI>Oriental Nations</HI> at this day, have their <HI>Me|tred Poetry;</HI> But it is of a late Original.
<PB N="xiii" REF="001946_0014_0FFCAF47075712F8">However, 'tis very certain, that all the skill in the World, will hardly find the Rules of that <HI>Metred Poetry</HI> ob&s;erved with any ex|actne&s;s in the Songs of the Sacred Scrip|tures. There is little value to be &s;et on the Authority, of either <HI>Philo,</HI> or <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> and and after them, of <HI>Jerom,</HI> who quotes <HI>Ori|gen</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> for it, when they go to re|&s;olve the <HI>Hebrew P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ie,</HI> into I know not what, <HI>Lyricks</HI> and <HI>Hexameters.</HI> And there|fore it may be hoped, that our Ver&s;ion may be relea&s;ed from the <HI>Chime</HI> of a, <HI>Similis De|&s;inentia,</HI> without being cen&s;ured for <HI>Un|poetical.</HI> The <HI>Sublime Thought,</HI> and the <HI>Di|vine Flame,</HI> alone is enough, to challenge the Character of <HI>Poetry</HI> for the&s;e Holy Compo|&s;ures.

<P>WE are to con&s;ider, That the <HI>Holy Men of GOD,</HI> who wrote the SCRIPTURE, were <HI>moved by His Holy Spirit,</HI> in and for the Writing of it; and the <HI>Spirit of Holine&s;s</HI> at the Time of the In&s;piration made &s;uitable <HI>Impre&s;&s;ions</HI> on the <HI>Affections</HI> of His Faithful Servants, The Good Men had their <HI>Hearts</HI> Holily, Graciou&s;ly, Divinely, and &s;uitably <HI>Affected</HI> with the <HI>Matter,</HI> which the Spirit of GOD employ'd their Pens to leave upon, their Parchments.

<P>A Lively FAITH, relying on the <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> and <HI>Perfections,</HI> and <HI>Promi&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Threatnings</HI> of GOD; and on the <HI>Mediation</HI> of our SAVIOUR.</P>

<P N="9">&sect;. 9. THERE is a wonderful Thing to be ob&s;erved concerning our PSALMS, which has hitherto been too much overlooked by all the <HI>Unin&s;pired Interpreters;</HI> But it is a Thing which our SAVIOUR, and His <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> who have quoted the PSALMS near Fifty Times, have led us into the Apprehen&s;ion of. This is, That they are full of <HI>Prophecies,</HI> and our <HI>P&s;alter</HI> is indeed the mo&s;t <HI>Prophetical Book</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>IT is more particularly, but not without holy <HI>A&s;toni&s;hments</HI>&mdash;to be ob&s;erved, That the De&s;ign of the PROPHETIC SPIRIT, in the PSALMS, all along has been to de&s;cribe the Sufferings of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation,</HI> as well
<PB N="xxix" REF="001946_0030_0FFCB0751135CEB8">as of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Surregate,</HI> under the Ty|ranny of <HI>Antichri&s;t;</HI> and foretel the Cha|racters and Confu&s;ions of that <HI>Wicked One,</HI> and of his Followers; and predict the Reco|very of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation</HI> from their long Di&s;per&s;ion, and a long Felicity for <HI>them,</HI> and the <HI>Converted Gentiles</HI> a&s;&s;ociated with them, under the &s;ucceeding Reign of the MES|SIAH; and that Happy &s;tate of the <HI>New Earth,</HI> in which, under the Influences of the <HI>New Heavens,</HI> there &s;hall <HI>dwell Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and the <HI>Tabernacle of</HI> GOD <HI>&s;hall be with Men, and He &s;hall dwell with them, and they &s;hall be His People, and</HI> GOD <HI>Him&s;elf &s;hall be with them, and be their</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>IT may be, The Word which we render, <HI>To the Chief Mu&s;ician,</HI> but which may be rendred, (and was of Old &s;o,) <HI>For the End,</HI> may be to intimate that the PSALMS are cal|culated eminently with an Eye to the Things which are to be done, at that which the Bible calls, <HI>The Time of the End.</HI> Indeed <HI>Jerom</HI> long ago found <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> in the PSALMS; And <HI>Austin</HI> affirm'd, That the PSALMS ought all to be under&s;tood, of CHRIST and His Church, and many of them refer to <HI>After Ages.</HI> But we now improve in our Di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, Upon the PSALMS, as we go along, the <HI>Devout Reader</HI> will find this
<PB N="xxx" REF="001946_0031_0FFCB077E24F9990"><HI>Key of David</HI> here communicated unto him.

<PB N="xxxii" REF="001946_0033_0FFCB4585064DA88">it. This One Thing mightily contributed unto the Downfall of <HI>Popery;</HI> which the <HI>Popi&s;h Chergy</HI> railing at, they never gave over until the profane and ob&s;cene <HI>Odes</HI> of the Pagan Poets, had among many People of Quality thru&s;t out the PSALMS of <HI>David.</HI> And <HI>Juel</HI> writing from <HI>England</HI> unto <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> beyond Sea, 1560, reported, That a <HI>Change</HI> now appeared vi&s;ibly among the Peo|ple, but nothing promoted it more, than the In|viting of People unto the <HI>Singing of PSALMS.</HI> This was begun at one Church in <HI>London,</HI> and quickly &s;pread it&s;elf unto the Neigh|bouring Places; and &s;ometimes at <HI>Pauls</HI> Cro&s;s, there would be no le&s;s than Sir Thou&s;and People Singing together. Truly, a growing Regard unto the Book of PSALMS, allowing us to &s;ay, <HI>The Time of Singing is come, and the voice of the Turtle is heard in the Land,</HI> will be among the hopeful <HI>Signs of the Times,</HI> and give as cau&s;e to hope, that it won't be long before it be &s;aid, <HI>The Winter is pa&s;t, and the Rain is over and gone.</HI></P>
<P>DOUBTLESS, <HI>The Day approaches</HI> wherein the <HI>Kingdom of GOD</HI> will appear in brighter di&s;plays of it, than the World has ever yet been Enlightened withal.

This, as Dr. <HI>Alli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> ob&s;erves, chiefly relates to the Kingdom of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ich;</HI> who is to execute the Cur&s;e expre&s;s'd in the la&s;t. Ver&s;e of the P&s;alm.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Patrick</HI> thinks, That when <HI>David</HI> was treated by <HI>Nathan,</HI> as he was, about Euilding the <HI>Temple,</HI> he not long after fell into a Contemplation of the Divine Maje&s;ty, who having built this great World for His <HI>Temple,</HI> needed none of his Erecting. The P&s;alm here begins in Terms like tho&s;e, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> VII. 22.</P>

<P N="4">4 GOD often &s;ends His <HI>Angels,</HI> into the <HI>Winds,</HI> and into the <HI>Lightnings</HI> and <HI>Thunders</HI> to execute His Royal Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="15">15 The Fating of <HI>Oil,</HI> and the Ointing with it, we all know, produces this effect. But be&s;ides this, hear <HI>David Kianchi. Indicat noctis Lampades, qua illumi|nant facies bominum.</HI></P>

<P>It may not be ami&s;s here to mention, what Mon&s;ieur <HI>Jurieu</HI> has ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>There are Three Sorts of <HI>In&s;truments</HI> frequently mentioned in the <HI>P&s;alms;</HI> The <HI>Cymbals,</HI> the <HI>P&s;alie|rys,</HI> and the <HI>Harps.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cymbals</HI> were large and broad pieces of Bra&s;s bent, and giving a &s;trong &s;ound; which were beaten very near in &s;uch a manner, as we now beat our <HI>Drums;</HI> and are known by the Name of <HI>Tymbals</HI> in our Days. Our Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in a famous Text alludes unto them.</P>
<P>The <HI>P&s;alterys</HI> were <HI>Violins,</HI> on which they play'd. with a Bow, Ten Strings belong'd unto it; and the &s;eve|ral Notes were managed with the Bow and the touch, as tis done on the <HI>Violins</HI> in our days.</P>
<P>The <HI>Harps,</HI> had Twelve Notes, and every Note had its own String, which was managed with the Fingers, and could not be altered by the different way of touching.</P>
<P>The <HI>Levites</HI> were the only Per&s;ons that were to play on the&s;e In&s;truments. Indeed we read of <HI>David,</HI> and all the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> playing on In&s;truments, at the Tran&s;portation of the Ark. But Mon&s;ieur <HI>Jurieu</HI> thinks, this might be one of the Irregularities which oc|ca&s;ioned the Death <HI>Unzah.</HI> At lea&s;t it may be &s;uppo&s;|ed, that this was not allowed of, Except in the Coun|trey and in private Hou&s;es. But in the <HI>Temple,</HI> no body dur&s;t play on In&s;truments, unle&s;s he were a <HI>Levite,</HI> or the Son of a <HI>Levite.</HI> We &s;ay, the Son of a <HI>Levite,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Rabbi's</HI> tell us, that &s;uch of the Levites as were Singers, did u&s;e to bring their Sons along with them, into the Court of the Prie&s;t, tho they were not come to their Full Age required unto the performance
<PB N="410" REF="001946_0447_0FFE51C5484DB798">of any Service there on their own bohalf. There is ano|ther Tradition of the <HI>Rabbi's,</HI> That is was allowable to make choice of <HI>Singers</HI> from among the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> provided they were by Marriage near akin to the <HI>Sacerdotal Race.</HI></P>
<P>But, O <HI>Sincere Chri&s;tians, Lifted up to Heaven!</HI> You all are <HI>Prie&s;ts of God:</HI> And of the Tribe, who may and &s;hall <HI>Sing</HI> His Prai&s;es. His <HI>Graces</HI> in your Souls, will be the Glorious In&s;truments wherewith you &s;hall perform the Noble Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6 The <HI>Bere&s;chith Rabba</HI> carries it, as if every Breath of a good Man &s;hould Prai&s;e the Lord; There &s;hould be a Prai&s;e of God in every Breath of &s;uch a Man. In the &s;trict Sen&s;e of it, this is not attainable by any Man Breathing in this Evil World. However to be Breath|ing after as much of this Attainment as can be come at, becomes a Chri&s;tian.</P>
