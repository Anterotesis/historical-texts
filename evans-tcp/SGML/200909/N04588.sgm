<P>MY Brethren, &s;eeing the Soul is the great Seat of Principles and Source of Action, it follows nece&s;&s;arily from thence, that the chief Points of Practical Religion are the&s;e two, namely, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> to u&s;e all proper Means to get it right &s;et or fixed upon &s;uitable Objects, and then to keep it &s;o again&s;t all Temptations to the contrary. Attempts to regulate the Speech and Life, are like to be but of little Service, while in the mean Time the Thoughts and Tendencies of the Soul are neglected, and &s;uffered to run at random without Notice and controul, like a Ve&s;&s;el a-drift without a Compa&s;s or Helm, wandering wherever the Winds or Waves carry her: For when the Soul is neglected, the bad Temper here|by contracted, mu&s;t needs have a corrupt
<PB N="4" REF="005699_0003_1026C636CB09DDE0">
Influence upon the whole Behaviour, of which it is the Parent.</P>
<P>As we cannot be truly religious at all un|til our Souls be thoroughly renewed by di|vine Influence; &s;o we cannot make Pro|gre&s;s in Religion unle&s;s we keep a &s;trict Guard over their Temper and Motions.</P>
<P>All outward Services before the Heart is changed, is like a Building without a Foun|dation, (e&s;pecially when depended on,) and all care and pains to regulate the Speech and Practice afterwards, while the Heart is ne|glected, are like endeavours to regulate a Watch, by ob&s;erving or trying to alter the Motions of the Wheels, while the Main-Spring is not touched, in which the chief Fault lies.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> therefore with great Rea&s;on ex|horts the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to this Duty, in the Words of our Text, and enforces his Entreaty by a weighty Argument; <HI>only take heed to thy &s;elf, and keep thy Soul diligently: i. e.</HI> particularly, e&s;pecially and above all, be careful and diligent in the u&s;e of all proper Means to keep thy Soul from Sin; the Soul being the principal and mo&s;t noble Part of Man, may be ju&s;tly called him&s;elf; and he
<PB N="5" REF="005699_0004_1026C63885AB9578">
that keeps it takes heed to him&s;elf to pur|po&s;e, and only he. Here it may be ob|&s;erved, That this Duty is recommended in our Text in the &s;ingular Number, that &s;o every Per&s;on may be the rather induced to apply it to him&s;elf, as if it were directed to him particularly by name; and hence we may infer, That the more clo&s;e and di&s;tinct pub|blick Di&s;cour&s;es are, they better they are like to an&s;wer their De&s;ign, for generals do not &s;trike.</P>
<P>Now the Argument that in&s;pired <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> offers to pre&s;s the preceeding Duty is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That unle&s;s the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> per|formed it, they would forget the Mercies and Judgments of God, and loo&s;e the Impre&s;&s;i|ons of them; <HI>lea&s;t thou forget the Things which thine Eyes have &s;een, and lea&s;t they depart from thy Heart. Mo&s;es</HI> here refers to the manifold Appearances of divine Pow|er and Mercy, which the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had beheld in their Deliverances from <HI>Egyp|tian</HI> Oppre&s;&s;ors, and all the other Enemies which laboured to ob&s;truct their Pa&s;&s;age in|to the promi&s;ed <HI>Canaan,</HI> as well as the Di&s;|plays of divine Glory and Goodne&s;s at <HI>Horeb;</HI> and likewi&s;e the Judgments of God inflicted
<PB N="6" REF="005699_0005_1026C63C6A93A498">
on impenitent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors among them|&s;elves. Now the Remembrance and Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things, tended to encrea&s;e their Love to God and fear of him and incite Obedience to his Laws; which were but ju&s;t returns of Gratitude for the invaluable Benefits they had received, and of the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ecure their highe&s;t Honour and their deare&s;t Intere&s;ts, both in this Life and that to come. But the contrary thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> Forgetfulne&s;s and Stupidity, &s;erved to prepare the Way for their Sin and Ruin!</P>
<P>By the Word <HI>Soul</HI> in our Text, is intend|ed that &s;piritual and immortal Sub&s;tance endowed with Under&s;tanding and Will; which it has plea&s;ed the great Creator to confer upon Man, by which he is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from, and advanced above the Brute-Creation. This is frequently called the <HI>Heart</HI> in Scripture, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 26. Matt. xxii. 37.</NOTE> to &s;ignify that it is the chief and mo&s;t noble Part of Man, the Source of Life and &s;pring of Action. The Terms Soul and Heart are doubtle&s;s &s;ynony|mous (or of the &s;ame import) in our Text, as appears by comparing both Parts thereof together.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005699_0006_1026C63DF0277BF0">In Di&s;cour&s;ing upon this Subject I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew what is <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> by, and <HI>imply'd</HI> in keeping the Soul diligently, and then proceed to the Improvement.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Fir&s;t: Keeping the Soul,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es the <HI>good State</HI> and <HI>Frame of it,</HI> for what is not good cannot be kept &s;o.</P>
<P>The Soul of Man indeed at his fir&s;t Crea|tion, was adorn'd with the divine Image, which con&s;i&s;ted in Knowledge, Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Holine&s;s, with Dominion over the Creatures. The Mind was furni&s;h'd with divine Light, and the Will and Affections with pious Propen&s;ities: Neither was their any vicious Taint in any of the Faculties to mar their religious Tendencies.</P>
<P>But when our fir&s;t Parents violated the Covenant of Works, their primitive Integri|ty was entirely lo&s;t; a univer&s;al Di&s;order &s;eiz'd the human Soul, and corrupted all its Powers; Darkne&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Mind, and a complicated Depravity the Will and Af|fections: So that their natural and general Bya&s;s is towards Sin and Vanity!</P>
<P>And hence a Renovation of them, or Re|&s;toration to &s;ome Degree of that moral Image
<PB N="8" REF="005699_0007_1026C644860171F0">
of God, which they have lo&s;t becomes ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to communion with God here, and the enjoyment of him hereafter. The native Darkne&s;s of the Mind mu&s;t be bani&s;hed and the Light of Day introduced. The Ob&s;tinacy of the Will broken, and 't made plyant to the Will of God; the Di&s;order of the Affections removed, and they fix'd in their free, general and &s;upreme Bent, upon God and divine Objects. Before this Change pa&s;&s;es upon the Soul, it can't be kept in a holy Frame; and therefore this &s;hou'd be fir&s;t &s;ought after with the utmo&s;t Vehemence: And indeed, 'till this be ob|tained, the Foundation of vital Piety is not laid. Hence our Lord enjoins us, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> to make the Tree good and then the Fruit will be good.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> The Command of keeping the Soul &s;uppo&s;es, the <HI>liablene&s;s</HI> even of the <HI>renewed Per&s;on to neglect his Soul,</HI> and wander from God like a lo&s;t Sheep, becau&s;e of remaining Corruption. Altho' the govern|ing Power of Sin be broke in the Regenerate, yet there is in them <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> as well as <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>old</HI> as well as the <HI>new Man;</HI> a <HI>Law</HI> in their <HI>Members</HI> waring again&s;t the <HI>Law</HI> of
<PB N="9" REF="005699_0008_1026C6460DC67D40">
from their <HI>Minds:</HI> This corrupt Principle lu&s;ts again&s;t the Spirit, tempts them to back&s;lide from God, and &s;ometimes leads them captive. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxix. 176. Rom. vii. Col. iii. 5.10. Gal. v. 17. Heb. xiii. 18.</NOTE> The numerous Falls of the Saints of God recorded in Scripture, are inconte&s;tible Evi|dences of this awful Truth. The be&s;t of Men are in Danger of the wor&s;t of Sins while on this Stage of Temptation; and e&s;pecially at &s;uch Sea&s;ons, when they neglect their own Hearts, and re&s;t upon Grace receiv'd.</P>
<P>It is true, neglecting and overlooking the Heart generally, becau&s;e it is hidden from the World, and taking care to regulate the Life chiefly for the &s;ake of Applau&s;e or any other &s;elfi&s;h End; is doubtle&s;s the Character of Hypocrites: And hence our Lord reprov|ed the Phari&s;ees <HI>for clean&s;ing the out &s;ide of the Cup and Plater, while the in&s;ide was ne|glected.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiii. 25.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the Contrary, gracious Per&s;ons no doubt (for the general) are chiefly careful of their Hearts: Yet in times of &s;piritual De&s;ertions and Decays, when with the Churches of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> and <HI>Sardis,</HI> they for|get
<PB N="10" REF="005699_0009_1026C648B8BAC420">
their fir&s;t Love and fall from their fir&s;t Works, and the Things that remain are ready to die, they may for a Time under the Power of Temptation, &s;adly neglect their own Hearts!</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This Command of keeping the Soul, &s;uppo&s;es the <HI>evil Nature</HI> and <HI>dange|rous Con&s;equences</HI> of <HI>neglecting it.</HI> As this is a manife&s;t Violation of God's <HI>Authority</HI> and Contempt of his <HI>Love;</HI> &s;o it is hurtful in its Fruits to our &s;elves and others; this robs us of our Peace and Comfort, this weakens our Hope and mars our Joy, as well as hinders our u&s;efulne&s;s. When the Soul is neglected, the gu&s;t or reli&s;h of divine Things gradually abates, and we grow cold and in&s;ipid in our religious Performances; the World greatens in our Eyes, and thro' want of a proper Guard, we are the more ea&s;ily en&s;nared by its Temp|tations, and being en&s;nared our Minds are perplex'd with guilt, and our Evidences for Heaven, blotted and eclip&s;ed: Now do not Deadne&s;s and &s;lavi&s;h Fear indi&s;po&s;e us to &s;peak and act for God, as well as make us very uncomfortable in our &s;elves?</P>
<P>But this is not all, while Per&s;ons neglect their own Hearts, the View of their own
<PB N="11" REF="005699_0010_1026C64A7598C3A0">
Iniquities being hid from them, they are in danger of being lifted up with Pride, and inclin'd to a cen&s;orious Severity, concerning the Conduct of others; who are, perhaps, more advanced in Knowledge and Goodne&s;s than them&s;elves; which Iniquity is as pre|judicial to the Peace and Benefit of Society, as it is contrary to the Word of God, which enjoyns us to <HI>be merciful as he is merciful,</HI> and a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>he &s;hall have Judgment</HI> without Mercy, <HI>who hath &s;hewed no Mercy.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">James ii. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>I might add, that thro' Neglect of the Heart &s;ome are &s;uddenly involv'd into tho&s;e crim&s;on Impieties, which bring Re|proach upon the Name, Ways and Peo|ple of God, as well as harden the Hearts of the Wicked; and thus they do grea|ter Injury in a little Time to Religion, then they have done Good in the pa&s;t Space of their Lives. O lamentable! &s;hould not therefore the P&s;almi&s;t's Petition re&s;pecting this be often in our Hearts and Mouths? <HI>Let none that &s;eek thee he a&s;hamed for my &s;ake Lord God of Ho&s;ts!</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxix. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005699_0011_1026C64F365ACF68">Surely Brethren the Di&s;orders of the Tongue and of the Life, do generally flow from the Neglect of the Heart. But to proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> This command of keeping the Soul <HI>diligently,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es the <HI>Difficulty of it,</HI> which ari&s;es partly from the Deceitfulne&s;s, and de&s;perate Wickedne&s;s that is in it, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. xvii. 9.</NOTE> and partly from the innumerable Tempta|tions to Sin, which are injected into it by the Devil and the World, all which it is very Difficult to oppo&s;e. Moreover tho' the Souls Affections are &s;ometimes warmly engag'd to|wards God and Religion by the Spirits In|fluence, yet &s;o &s;oon as that is withdrawn, they return to their Native Coldne&s;s by Degrees, as warm Water taken from the Fire, or the Earth when the Sun withdraws his beamy Warmth far from the Horizon: now it is exceeding difficult to with&s;tand Deadne&s;s, when it comes upon us like an arm'd Man.</P>
<P>And that which renders this Work the more Difficult, is the <HI>Con&s;tancy</HI> of it, it mu&s;t be continu'd in to our dying Breath; if we intermit but a few Moments we
<PB N="13" REF="005699_0012_1026C651DDAEADB8">
run a dreadful Ri&s;que of incurring the Con&s;equences before mentioned. To keep the out&s;ide tolerably regular, and to per|form Duties with a carele&s;s Frame of Heart, is no great Matter, and does not require great Labour.</P>
<P>But to with&s;tand all Temptations to Sin, and labour for the Crucifixtion of it; with Groans that cannot be uttered! To &s;trive in the faithful U&s;e of all proper Means, to pre&s;erve good Impre&s;&s;ions, and to &s;tir up our &s;elves to take hold on God in every Duty, and that not only when he is pre&s;ent with us, but ab&s;ent from us. O this is exceeding Difficult! and is therefore ju&s;tly compar'd by our Lord to a <HI>&s;trait Gate and narrow Way.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 13.14.</NOTE> Such as do mind their own Hearts, will find Work enough there, without being bu&s;ie Bodies in other Mens Matters.&mdash;</P>
<P>In the mean Time let me ob&s;erve my Brethren, that tho' the keeping of our Souls is exceeding Difficult, yet thro' Mercy it is not an impo&s;&s;ible and hopele&s;s Ta&s;k. Allbeit con&s;idered in our&s;elves we are not equal to it, yet he who enjoyns it, is able
<PB N="14" REF="005699_0013_1026C6536448ECD8">
to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the Performance of it: Thro' Chri&s;t we can do all Things, but without his A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Influence we can do no|thing to Purpo&s;e in Religion. <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xvi 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>I proceed to &s;hew what is <HI>imply'd</HI> in keeping the Soul, and here I may ob&s;erve. That it implies in General, <HI>the earne&s;t and con&s;tant U&s;e of all appointed Means to keep the Soul from Sin, and pre&s;erve its Sen&s;e of divine Things:</HI> And hence we are bid to <HI>keep our &s;elves in the Love of God.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jud. xxi.</NOTE> But particularly,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It implies, our <HI>Jealou&s;ie and Watch|fullne&s;s over the Thoughts, Affections, and De&s;igns of our Souls.</HI> We &s;hould be jealous over them with a godly Jealou&s;ie, lea&s;t <HI>a deceived Heart turn us a&s;ide,</HI> and <HI>we feed upon A&s;hes and die with a Lye in our Right Hand.</HI> The Heart by Nature is a grand Cheat. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. xvii. 9.</NOTE> And even after Conver&s;ion &s;o much of that Falacy remains as &s;hould put us con&s;tantly upon our Guard. <NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xvi. 23.</NOTE> Surely as <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>There is a Way which &s;eems right to a Man, the End whereof is Death.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pro. xiv. 12.</NOTE> And el&s;ewhere he informs us, That
<PB N="15" REF="005699_0014_1026C655293DE068">
<HI>every Way of Man is Right in his own Eyes, but the Lord ponders the Hearts.</HI> <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Pro. xxi. 2.</NOTE> It is therefore no wonder that he declares him to <HI>be a Fool, that tru&s;teth in his Heart,</HI> and on the Contrary pronounces a <HI>ble&s;&s;ing on the Man that feareth always.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pro. xxviii. 14.</NOTE> And as we &s;hould beware of believing ra&s;hly, and confidently the Notions of our Hearts without a &s;trict Tryal of them by the Law and the Te&s;timony, to which, except we attend and abide by, the Prophet declares that <HI>there is no Light in us.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. viii. 20.</NOTE> So we &s;hould keep a con&s;tant Watch over the Thoughts of our Souls that the Di&s;orders thereof may be &s;ea&s;onably &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, at their fir&s;t ri&s;e, before they come to a Head.

<P><HI>Secondly, Keeping our Souls,</HI> implies our <HI>faithful oppo&s;ing the fir&s;t Ri&s;ings of Corrup|tion in them, and a careful avoiding of tho&s;e

<P>And &s;eeing our Corruptions are apt to be inflamed by the Pre&s;ence of &s;ome Objects, it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to keep at a Di&s;tance from them, and thereby avoid the Appear|ances of Evil. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. v. 22.</NOTE> If we pray as we are di|rected, that we be not led into Temptation, and yet run unnece&s;&s;arily into it, do we not contradict our Prayers by our Practice, as well as betray our In&s;incerity, and tempt the righteous God to for&s;ake us, and &s;uffer our Enemies to en&s;nare and triumph over us?

Indeed, without frequent lifting up of the Heart to God by ejaculatory Prayer, as the various Occa&s;ions of Life require, the &s;avour of Piety will gradually langui&s;h in our Souls. The Improvement of this Subject yet remains.</P>
<P>Methinks, Sirs, what has been &s;aid, of|fers Matter of Reproof to tho&s;e who wholly neglect their Souls, and depend on outward Acts of Wor&s;hip: Surely that God who is a Spirit, will not accept of bodily Wor&s;hip without the Spirit. Tho&s;e who habitually neglect their Souls and rely on externals, are Hypocrites in Religion, like the Phari|&s;ees of old; their &s;acred Service is abhorred by God! <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. i. 11.13, 14.</NOTE> and their Per&s;ons will be finally rejected of him, if they continue in this Ca&s;e. <HI>For except our Righteou&s;ne&s;s exceeds that of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees,</HI> the Mouth of Truth has told us, <HI>we can in no ca&s;e enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 20</NOTE></P>

<P>The Neglect of the Soul, my Brethren, &s;oon manife&s;ts it &s;elf in the Practice: What but this, is the Cau&s;e of <HI>Debates, Envyings, Wraths, Strifes, Backbitings, Whi&s;perings, Swellings, Tumults?</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xii. 10.</NOTE> which are &s;o di&s;ho|nourable and detrimental to Religion!</P>
<P>Surely all &s;uch as neglect their own Souls, are guilty of rebellion again&s;t God's Autho|rity, and ingratitude again&s;t his Love. For which of all God's Kindne&s;&s;es do they thus requite him? O that &s;uch would con|&s;ider the Evil of their Negligence, as well as the Injury they thereby do to them&s;elves, and the Way they prepare to do mi&s;chief to others!

<P>By this, <HI>God will be glorified,</HI> not only by your Obedience to this particular Precept, but by a holy Conver&s;ation i&s;&s;uing from it; which is one of the mo&s;t beautiful Orna|ments and &s;tronge&s;t Attractives to invite others to &s;incere Religion.</P>

<P>Keeping the Soul as it tends to prevent <HI>Guilt, Di&s;tance from God,</HI> and <HI>Deadne&s;s in Duty,</HI> &s;o it of con&s;equence lays the Per&s;on open as it were, to divine <HI>Influence,</HI> which drops like the Dew of <HI>Hermon</HI> on the Moun|tains of <HI>Zion.</HI> Without this we cannot grow in Goodne&s;s, but by it we are fed and nou|ri&s;hed as with Marrow and Fatne&s;s.</P>
<P>We are commanded, my Brethren! to grow in Grace; which, doubtle&s;s, implys our earne&s;t u&s;e of means for that end, among which, that of keeping the Soul is a principal One; in this Way we may humbly hope, that Chri&s;t will dwell in our Hearts by Faith, and that we &s;hall be rooted and grounded in Love, and &s;o be prepar'd for the various Tryals which await us in this pre&s;ent World of change, labour and mi&s;ery, and be at la&s;t receiv'd into the Man&s;ions of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s: <HI>Which may God grant for Chri&s;t's &s;ake.</HI></P>
