</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE office of a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, as it is a mo&s;t weighty, &s;o it is as trying a lot as any that mortals were ever employed in. They are made a &s;pectacle unto the world, to angels and to men: All eyes are upon them, and if they are faithful they will be hated and envied by many. Thus is has been in all ages. The great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, though one of the mo&s;t faithful and exemplary men that ever lived, was traduced in the famous church of Corinth, as a whiffling and incon&s;i&s;tent per&s;on, not to be regarded; and though rational beings mu&s;t ever allow, that a wi&s;e man may alter his purpo&s;e for good sea&s;ons, yet the apo&s;tle's doing &s;o, and not coming to them as he had propo&s;ed, is catch'd.
<PB N="6" REF="012316_0004_0F8A204B476737C8">hold of to &s;upport the&s;e &s;landers. Their evil in &s;o doing is plainly expo&s;ed in the fir&s;t chapter of this epi&s;tle; where we may al&s;o note, that the ab&s;ur|dity and wickedne&s;s that many practi&s;e to this day, of connecting the go&s;pel it&s;elf with the character of it's preachers, is as old as the apo&s;tles time; for, becau&s;e Paul had acquainted them with his de&s;ign of vi&s;iting them, but had not done it, deceitful men not only in&s;inuated that he was a fal&s;e man, but that his preaching was &s;o too; <HI>yea and nay,</HI> incon&s;i&s;t|ency and non&s;en&s;e not to be regarded, as if the weakne&s;s or iniquity of men were any argument again&s;t the truth of God! This conduct is a glar|ing proof of what all men are naturally inclined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, namely, that they are rebels again&s;t heaven; for it is a maxim with &s;ubjects, <Q>That their King can do no wrong;</Q> thereby imputing the evils that are done, to his mini&s;ters and &s;ervants: Whereas in the ca&s;e before us, the KING of heaven is bla&s;|phemed, his go&s;pel and his &s;ervice &s;lighted, under the covert of the hypocri&s;y of others. And all tho&s;e who can make the weakne&s;s or evils of teachers or profe&s;&s;ors an excu&s;e for their own neglect of reli|gion, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure guilty of this madne&s;s; for let men be ever &s;o imperfect or fal&s;e, Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel is eternal truth; therefore all tho&s;e that do not receive the &s;ame, implicitly &s;ay, <Q>We will not have this man to reign over us.</Q></P>
<P>As there curring to the evils of others to excu&s;e our own neglect, is a fal&s;e way, &s;o it often happens with tho&s;e who go therein, that what they alledge again&s;t others is not true; which was the ca&s;e here And after a ju&s;t vindication of the apo&s;tle and his
<PB N="7" REF="012316_0005_0F8A204D1445A2E0">companion, he begins this chapter with a&s;king the Corinthians, if there was any need of epi&s;tles of commendation to or from that church in their be|half, &s;ince the &s;aving effects of their mini&s;try re|mained in indelible characters, written in their hearts by the Spirit of the living God? Where teachers are not known, they need epi&s;tles of com|mendation to introduce them, which is an apo&s;to|lic cu&s;tom, and which many in our day have not &s;uffi|ciently regarded, Acts 18.27. But when per&s;ons have experienced the &s;aving power of their preach|ing, that gives a greater confirmation of their divine mi&s;&s;ion, than human letters can do. However, though the apo&s;tle improves this evidence to &s;ilence gain&s;ayers, he would not have any think that they had any &s;ufficiency in them&s;elves for this work; no, not &s;o much as to <HI>think any thing as of them|&s;elves:</HI> Not to regulate their thoughts, or form any ju&s;t conclu&s;ions. But &s;ays he, <HI>All our &s;uffi|ciency is of God, who al&s;o hath made us able mini&s;ters of the New-te&s;tament, not of the letter but of the &s;pirit; for the letter killeth, but the &s;pirit giveth life.</HI> In which words you naturally ob&s;erve, who it is that makes go&s;pel mini&s;ters, the &s;ubject of their mini&s;try, and the effect of it: Each of which I &s;hall endeavour briefly to explain and improve on this occa&s;ion, as a&s;&s;i&s;tance may be granted.</P>
<P N="1">I. You ob&s;erve, it is God that makes able mini|&s;ters. This perhaps none will deny; but the grand que&s;tion is. How he does it? I an&s;wer, Fir&s;t, he does it by making them <HI>new creatures.</HI> This is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the very nature of their work, and
<PB N="8" REF="012316_0006_0F8A204DF159B290">&s;o plainly revealed in the &s;cripture, that if it were not for the prejudices of education and carnal intere&s;t, if would be needle&s;s to &s;tand to prove it. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. A principal part of their work is to labour to <HI>reconcile</HI> &s;inners to God; and to imagine any one to be fit for that work, who is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> re|conciled him&s;elf, is one of the fir&s;t-born of ab&s;ur|dities. All know that the more gifted or crafty an enemy is, the more he is to be avoided and guarded again&s;t, in&s;tead of being encru&s;ted with our mo&s;t weighty affairs: And what in it &s;hort of bla&s;phemy, to pretend that the mo&s;t High will do &s;o! Our apo&s;tle &s;ays, <Q>All things are of God, who hath <HI>reconviled us</HI> unto him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and hath <HI>given to us the mini&s;try of re|conriliation,</HI> chap. 5.18.</Q> This is God's order; he fir&s;t reconciles the per&s;on, makes him a <HI>new creature,</HI> as in the preceding ver&s;e, and then grace him the mini&s;try of reconciliation.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of their work is <HI>&s;piritual;</HI> and how can <HI>carnal</HI> men perform it? Our Lord a&s;&s;ured a ma&s;ter in I&s;rael that, <Q>Except a man be <HI>born again,</HI> he <HI>cannot &s;ee</HI> the kingdom of God:</Q> And If he cannot <HI>&s;ee</HI> it, how can he act In it as he ought? The natural man <HI>receiveth</HI> not, neither can be <HI>know</HI> the things of the Spirit of God, and for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e they are <HI>&s;piritually di&s;cern|ed,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.14. Rea&s;on will teach us that, <Q>Simple ideas are only to be got by tho&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions objects them&s;elves make on our minds, by the proper inlets appointed to each fort; and
<PB N="9" REF="012316_0007_0F8A204E42C76530">if they are not received this way, all the words in the world, made u&s;e of to define, or explain any of their names, will never be able to produce in us the idea it &s;tands for.</Q> As for in&s;tance, the true idea of light and colours cannot be had but by perceiving them with our &s;ight; without which an ingenious blind man could get no nearer the idea of <HI>&s;carlet,</HI> than that <Q>It was like the &s;ound of a trumpet. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LOCKE's e&s;&s;ay on under&s;tanding. 6.3. chap. 7. S. 11.</NOTE></Q> And revelation informs us, that the way by which the &s;pirit of truth guides his people into all truth, is by receiving of the things of Chri&s;t, and <HI>&s;hewing</HI> the &s;ame <HI>unto them,</HI> John 16.13, 14. The <HI>vail</HI> remains on mens hearts un|til the &s;pirit takes it away, and gives them with <HI>open face</HI> to behold the divine glory, whereby they are <HI>changed into the &s;ame image,</HI> context ver. 14&mdash;18.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters are to comfort others by the comfort where with <HI>they them&s;elves are comforted of God,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.4. They are to lead others in a way they are acquainted with, and ought to be able to &s;ay, <HI>We &s;peak that we know, and te&s;tify that we have &s;een.</HI> Experimental knowledge is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary that even our great high Prie&s;t him&s;elf, though he were a &s;on, yet learned he obedience by the things that he &s;uffered; and being tempted, he was able to &s;uccour them that are tempted. I would illu&s;trate this point by a familiar in&s;tance: We are not far from <HI>Cape-God,</HI> which is well known to be a dan|gerous coa&s;t for &s;eamen, &s;o that it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom for all that go round it to take a pilot. Now &s;uppo&s;e a man of good &s;en&s;e, who had &s;een exact charts of every point, rock or quick-&s;and up|on the coa&s;t, and had all the intelligence that books
<PB N="10" REF="012316_0008_0F8A204EF90F8370">or men could give him about them, yet had never &s;een them him&s;elf; who will venture round the Cape with &s;uch a pilot? Don't each one rather give in to the old maxim, that, <HI>nothing teaches like experience?</HI> Yet in the ca&s;e before us many are &s;o far from allowing it, that we have ma&s;ters in our I&s;rael, who would take it as an affront to be a&s;ked, whether they had experienced the new-birth or not?</P>
<P N="3">3. No man can act from any higher principle than <HI>&s;elf,</HI> until he is born from above; yet as &s;urely as Chri&s;t &s;peaks true, no man <HI>can</HI> be his di&s;ciple, (how much le&s;s his mini&s;ter?) except he <HI>deny him&s;elf,</HI> and take up his cro&s;s and follow Chri&s;t. Men may, and often do, deny one lu&s;t to gratify another; may cro&s;s luxury to gratify covetou&s;ne&s;s, or cro&s;s covetou&s;ne&s;s to indulge luxury or ambition: Yea, may in &s;ome &s;en&s;e cro&s;s all the&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s; yet &s;till they get no higher than &s;elf; they do not deny &s;elf, therefore &s;uch cannot be fit to be Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters; for his mini&s;ters preach <HI>not them&s;elves,</HI> but Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, and them&s;elves the church's &s;ervants for Je&s;us &s;ake. And the way they are brought to this is, <HI>God who commanded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined in their hearts,</HI> to give the light of the know|ledge of his glory. This, and this only can and doth give them to act from more noble principles, than &s;elf-&s;eeking and &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s: It enables them to preach by <HI>faith,</HI> and in their conduct to look to things <HI>un&s;een, which are eternal,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.5, 6.13.18. Hence,</P>
<P N="4">4. All allow the mini&s;ters work to be very great and difficult, in which they have &s;pecial need of divine
<PB N="11" REF="012316_0009_0F8A204FB41269F0">help; and to tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t &s;ends, he &s;ays, <HI>Lo, I am with you;</HI> and they are to be &s;trong in the grace that is in him: But how can that be without union with him, even as the branch has with the vine? Without which he a&s;&s;ures us that we <HI>can do nothing;</HI> and the words before our text tell us that <HI>all our &s;ufficiency is of God.</HI> How far he may gird tho&s;e who know him not for particular purpo&s;es, I leave; but how can any &s;oul plead for promi&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance without faith, for <HI>how &s;hall they call on him in whom they have not believed?</HI> Rom. 10.14.</P>
<P>Therefore &s;ince men mu&s;t be reconciled them|&s;elves, before they can heartily &s;eek for others re|conciliation to God; &s;ince it is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;pi|ritually taught in order to teach others &s;piritual things, and to be &s;upernaturally enlightened in order to act above &s;elf, and to have acquaintance with, and a tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, in order to plead his promi&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance; how clear is the evidence that he makes men new creatures in order to make them his mi|ni&s;ters? If any &s;hould alledge <HI>Judas</HI> again&s;t this, I would only a&s;k, whether they think his ex|ample was for imitation, or for warning? If they think for imitation, then how many <HI>traiters</HI> mu&s;t we have? If for warning, then let us take it, and beware of &s;uch men. And by the way I would have them remember that <HI>Judas</HI>'s commi&s;&s;ion was limited to the <HI>national</HI> church; the pure go&s;pel commi&s;&s;ion was given to the <HI>eleven,</HI> after Judas was gone to his own place, Mat. 10.5, 6. and 28.16, 10. If to evade all this any will &s;ay, we cannot know who are born again and who not. I reply, that our Lord has told us, <HI>that</HI> we &s;hall know them,
<PB N="12" REF="012316_0010_0F8A20507B5A4E30">and <HI>how</HI> we &s;hall know them, Mat. 7.15, 16.&mdash; Luk. 6.44, 45. And if men do not believe him, &s;till he abides faithful, he cannot deny him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I therefore proceed to ob&s;erve, that he makes mini&s;ters by giving <HI>&s;pecial gifts</HI> for that work. I am as far as any man from &s;uppo&s;ing that renewing grace, is the only qualification nece&s;&s;ary for a go&s;|pel mini&s;ter. When our Lord a&s;cended on high he <HI>gave gifts</HI> unto men, among which were gifts for <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> Eph. 4.8, 11. Special gi&s;ts both to under&s;tand, and to communicate divine things to the in&s;truction and edification of others; and the command is, <HI>As every man hath received the gift, even &s;o mini&s;ter,</HI> &amp;c. Let the gift be re|ceived by more public or more private means, there is no limitation as to that, but every man that God has given the gift to, be commands them to im|prove the &s;ame as <HI>good &s;tewards</HI> of his manifold grace; and by his Spirit he teaches them their duty in this re&s;pect, as I have more largely &s;hewn el&s;ewhere. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;cour&s;e on an internal call to preach the go&s;pel.</NOTE></P>
<P>Once more, God makes able mini&s;ters, by teach|ing and inclining his people to call and &s;et apart to public office tho&s;e whom he has prepared therefor. As he has commanded each one to improve the gifts that are given to him, &s;o he has granted to his people an unalienable right to judge of &s;uch mat|ters, for mini&s;ters are not lords over their faith, but helpers of their joy; and Paul him&s;elf &s;ays, to the church of Corinth, <HI>I &s;peak as to wi&s;e men, judge ye what I &s;ay.</HI> And another church is commended by their glorious Head, becau&s;e they had tried them
<PB N="13" REF="012316_0011_0F8A20514EB3BF88">that &s;aid they were apo&s;tles and were not, and had found them liars, Rev. 2.2.</P>
<P>There hath been much contention both formerly and lately about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mini&s;ters, and of mini&s;terial authority; but I think Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> in the la&s;t century, has &s;tated this matter to good purpo&s;e: Says he, <Q>The office of the mini&s;try for the conti|nuation of the church-&s;tate, and admini&s;tration of all ordinances of wor&s;hip unto the end of the world, is &s;ufficiently &s;ecured, (1.) By the law, con&s;ti|tution and appointment, of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, erecting that office, and giving warrants for it's continuance to the con&s;ummation of all things, Mat. 28.20. Eph. 4.13. (2.) By his continu|ance according unto his promi&s;e to communicate <HI>&s;piritual gifts</HI> unto men, for the mini&s;terial edi|fication of the church. That this he doth &s;o continue to do, that it is the principal external evidence of his abiding in the di&s;charge of his mediatory office. (3.) On the duty of believers, or of the church, which is to choo&s;e, call, and &s;olemnly &s;et apart unto the office of the mini&s;try, &s;uch as the Lord Chri&s;t, by <HI>his Spirit,</HI> hath made meet for it, according unto the rule of his word. And tho&s;e who plead for the continuation of a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive</HI> mini&s;try, without re&s;pect unto the&s;e things, without re&s;olving both the authority and office of it unto them, do but erect a <HI>dead image,</HI> or embrace a dead carca&s;e, in&s;tead of the living and life giving in&s;titutions of Chri&s;t. They take away the living creature, and &s;et up a <HI>&s;kin &s;tuffed with &s;traw.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. OWEN, on the original of evangelical churches, p. 164, 165.</NOTE></Q> We come,</P>

II. To con&s;ider the &s;ubject of their mini&s;try, which in our text is de&s;cribed both negatively and po&s;itively. They are mini&s;ters not of the <HI>letter</HI> but of the <HI>&s;pirit;</HI> and to explain the letter, the law <HI>written and engraven in &s;tones</HI> is named, the tenor of which is, <HI>If a man do them, he &s;hall live in them;</HI> but <HI>cur&s;ed is every one that doth them not,</HI> Levi. 18. 5. Gal. 3.10, 12. which is therefore here called, the <HI>mini&s;tration of death,</HI> becau&s;e no man upon earth doeth tho&s;e precepts, the penalty then is the certain con&s;equence. This is the letter; but from the a|po&s;tles mentioning that which is <HI>done away,</HI> and that which is <HI>aboli&s;hed,</HI> it appears that the ceremoni|al law is al&s;o included, which, though a &s;hadow of good things to come; yet the letter of it enjoined a multitude of offerings and works to be done by that people, enforced with terrible penalties on tho&s;e who did them not. Indeed the whole mini&s;try of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is intended, which was very <HI>glorious,</HI> and &s;hined with great lu&s;tre in the manner of giving the law, and in the many tokens that were given of his being taught and owned of God in his mini&s;trations, yet when <HI>Mo&s;es was read</HI> by the Jews, the <HI>vail</HI> was &s;o upon their hearts, that they could not <HI>&s;ted|fa&s;tly look to the and of that which is aboli&s;hed.</HI> They &s;tuck in what the letter required of them, without beholding the perfect fulfillment both of the moral and ceremonial law in the great Me&s;&s;iah: Which leads us to con&s;ider the <HI>&s;pirit which giveth life;</HI> which is here al&s;o called the <HI>new-te&s;tament.</HI> This cannot mean meerly that part of the bible that is &s;o called in di&s;tinction from the re&s;t; for the apo&s;tles made abundant u&s;e of the old-te&s;tament in their mini&s;try, and drew evangelical in&s;tructions from all
<PB N="15" REF="012316_0013_0F8A20542C6E2D10">parts of it; and they expre&s;ly declare to us that tho&s;e &s;criptures were all given by divine in&s;piration, for our learning and admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come, 1 Cor. 10.11. Rom. 15.4. 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. It is well known that the word te&s;tament means the &s;ame as a <HI>will,</HI> whereby a per&s;on orders his affairs, and di&s;po&s;es of his inter|e&s;t as he thinks be&s;t; &s;o here it plainly means what is called the new covenant, in di&s;tinction from the old. When the great Creator had formed the world and all that is therein, he was plea&s;ed to crown man with glory and honor, and &s;et him over the works of his hands, and to make known to him his will, and the tenor on which he &s;hould enjoy his e&s;tate and happine&s;s, even perfect obedience to his law and that tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion &s;hould &s;trip him of life, and all. Man &s;inned and ruined him&s;elf and his po&s;terity: Therefore &s;ince the fir&s;t Adam is thus fallen, all things are put into the hands of the &s;econd Adam, who is the Lord from heaven; and who will &s;ub|due all things unto him&s;elf, yea will &s;wallow up death in victory. P&s;a. 8.5, 6. 1 Cor. 15, 45&mdash;54. Heb. 2.7&mdash;9.</P>
<P>Some notice of this great deliverer was given to our fir&s;t parents &s;oon after the fall, under the name of the &s;eed of the woman who &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head. And he was further promi&s;ed to Abraham, that in his feed all the families of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed. This new-te&s;tament way of &s;alvation is clearly opened in the go&s;pel, which di&s;covers how Chri&s;t was made of a woman, of A|braham's &s;eed, and by his obedience and &s;ufferings in our &s;tead, has procured a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="16" REF="012316_0014_0F8A20544EFD0D28">which is unto all and upon all them that believe; which therefore is here called, the <HI>mini&s;tration of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> ver. 9. In con&s;equence of which the holy Spirit is given to take away the vail from men's hearts, and give them with open face as in a gla&s;s to behold the glory of the Lord, whereby they are changed into his image. From all which it appears that, by the New-te&s;tament, and the &s;pirit that giveth life, is intended the way of ju&s;tification by Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of regeneration and &s;ancti|fication by the power of the holy Gho&s;t; which may well be &s;aid to give life, as the one delivers from the law-&s;entence of death, and the other from the power of corruption which is &s;piritual death, and enables the &s;oul to live unto God. This leads us,</P>
<P N="3">III. To con&s;ider the effect of the go&s;pel mini&s;try. The letter killeth, but the &s;pirit giveth life. The letter kills when it comes with light and power up|on the mind, by laying open the corruption and contrariety of the heart to God, and fixing the ju&s;t &s;entence of death in the con&s;cience whereby all the hopes they have built on the life of their own hands, give up the gho&s;t. Thus our apo&s;tle &s;ays, "Sin revived and I <HI>died;</HI> but when the letter had killed him, the Spirit of God revealed his Son in him, and drew his &s;oul to a marriage union to <HI>Him who is rai&s;ed from the dead,</HI> that he might &s;erve in <HI>new|ne&s;s of &s;pirit,</HI> and not in the <HI>oldne&s;s of the letter,</HI> Rom. 7.4,&mdash;10. But where the letter only is preached, it killeth, as it takes life and courage from men, becau&s;e the law requires what it gives no &s;trength to perform, and the &s;oul &s;inks in dejection and de&s;pair, or tries to quit the thoughts of the&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="012316_0015_0F8A20550468C4D8">things for fear thereof; or el&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch teaching to be right, people go on in a round of duties with a name to live while they are dead, and the blind lead the blind, until both fall into eter|nal death.</P>
<P>From hence, my Brethren, we may learn, 1. The va&s;t importance of the go&s;pel mini&s;try. Nothing le&s;s than the affairs of life and death are concerned therein; not &s;uch a tran&s;itory one as we have here; no, it is nothing le&s;s than the eternal life, or eternal death of precious &s;ouls. If mini&s;ters are e|nabled to be faithful, they may be in&s;trumental of the life of many; of &s;aving them&s;elves, and tho&s;e that hear them, 1 Tim. 4.16. But if otherwi&s;e, they know not how much mi&s;chief they may do; how many blind &s;ouls they may lead to de&s;truction, nor how many righteous ones they may make &s;ad. O my fathers and brethren in the mini&s;try, how &s;hould the&s;e things rou&s;e us all up! How &s;hould they move us all to &s;earch our hearts and ways, and cau&s;e each one to exert him&s;elf in his &s;tation, not counting his life dear unto him&s;elf, &s;o that he might fini&s;h his cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try he has received to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of God! And did chri&s;tians view the&s;e things as they ought, how careful would it make them concerning tho&s;e whom they received into the mini&s;try? And al&s;o to pray for their mini&s;ters more, and to tru&s;t them le&s;s than many do. Who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things? Surely none are of them&s;elves; and yet if per&s;ons have received benefit by any in&s;trument, how prone are they to expect the like again without looking to the great fountain of all good? Did
<PB N="18" REF="012316_0016_0F8A2055C1992248">chri&s;tians more clearly view the&s;e things as they are, they would be engaged to commit their mini&s;ters and them&s;elves too more earne&s;tly unto Him who is all in all to his people. The great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, notwith&s;tanding all his gi&s;ts and attain|ments, &s;eemed as if he could not write one e|pi&s;tle without &s;tirring up the &s;aints to this duty, &s;ay|ing, <Q>Brethren, pray for us; pray for us that the word of the Lord may have free cour&s;e and be glorified; &s;triving together with me in your prayers,</Q> &amp;c. And &s;urely there is great encou|ragement &s;o to do, for when God appears in his glory to build up Zion, he will regard the prayer of the de&s;titute, and not de&s;pi&s;e their prayer, P&s;a. 102.17.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence &s;ee the great importance of ever keep|ing law and go&s;pel in their di&s;tinct place, &s;ince one kills, and the other gives life. The law is good if we u&s;e it lawfully. It's proper u&s;e is to &s;hew us what we ought to be, and in that light to convince us that we are not &s;uch, for by the law is the <HI>knowledge of &s;in;</HI> but if it is made u&s;e of to teach &s;ouls how to obtain the divine favor, or how to ob|tain eternal life, it is then put out of it's proper place. Though we hear nany cry out, <Q>what! mu&s;t we teach &s;inners no duty till they are converted?</Q> yes, by all means; teach them their indi&s;pen&s;able obligation to keep the whole law, and that they are bound over to an&s;wer for every neglect of it, at the great tribunal.&mdash;This many conceit is too &s;trict, and often plead for an abatement of the law, like the un|ju&s;t &s;teward, who for a hundred would write fifty or four &s;core. But what is this abatement? Is it
<PB N="19" REF="012316_0017_0F8A205677A383D8">like Ezekiel's hearers, to come before God <HI>as his people,</HI> and with their <HI>mouth</HI> to &s;hew <HI>much love,</HI> while their <HI>heart</HI> goeth after their coveteou&s;ne&s;s? The &s;um of the law is to love God with all our hearts, and our neighbours as our&s;elves; and Je&s;us &s;aid, <HI>This do and thou &s;halt live.</HI> But the lawyer, willing to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, left God out of the que&s;tion and &s;aid, <HI>Who is my neighbour?</HI> This is a notable abatement indeed! In trying rebels, for the judge to leave the King out of the que&s;tion, and only try how they had behaved to each other! Yet how poorly does he make out even in this way? For by the in&s;tance of a man that fell among thieves, our Lord &s;hews that a <HI>Samaritan</HI> (with whom they would have no dealings) di&s;covered &s;uch <HI>love</HI> to a proper ob|ject of <HI>compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> as both their Prie&s;t and Levite did not, Luk. 10.29&mdash;37. So have I known &s;ome who would quote that &s;ummary of the divine re|quirement in Mica. 6.8. and evidently ri&s;e no higher in their notion of doing <HI>ju&s;tly,</HI> than ju&s;t dealing towards men; as if robbing God of his ju&s;t due, which is all the heart, all the &s;oul, &s;trength and mind, did not demand &s;atisfaction! Yea, and how often is it now found, that many who profe&s;s to walk humbly with God in the forms of religion, yet pay little regard to an&s;wering their <HI>ju&s;t</HI> engagements to men, or to &s;hew <HI>mercy</HI> to tho&s;e who &s;tand in need?</P>
<P>If we come to a review of this text, we may &s;ee that the Lord had commenced an action again&s;t I&s;|rael for their ingratitude and di&s;obedience, and cal|led the mountains and hills to be judges of their &s;tu|pid conduct. They &s;oon &s;aw they could not &s;tand
<PB N="20" REF="012316_0018_0F8A205731F26850">the trial, and enquired how they &s;hould make up the matter; whether he would not be <HI>plea&s;ed</HI> if they brought large offerings, or a multitude of them? And if irrational victims would not do, whether hu|man ones would not plea&s;e him? And they talk of offering the fruit of their body for the &s;in of their &s;oul. The an&s;wer is, he hath <HI>&s;hewed</HI> thee O man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do <HI>ju&s;tly?</HI> &amp;c. He had <HI>&s;hewed</HI> them in the foregoing chapter, that out of Bethlehem HE &s;hould come forth that is to be ruler in I&s;rael, who&s;e <HI>goings forth</HI> have been <HI>from everla&s;ting;</HI> and that, <HI>this man &s;hall be the peace.</HI> God requires no more than his ju&s;t due, and this God-man, and he only can pay it. He only has opened a way for righ|teou&s; e&s;s and peace to kifs each other in the &s;inner's &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Some imagine that by letter, the literal meaning of &s;cripture is intended; and by &s;pirit &s;ome my&s;ti|cal meaning that is hid under it; and from hence they call the word, a dead lever; but how greatly do &s;uch un&s;take the text? The letter <HI>killeth,</HI> and certainly that which actively kills others can't be a dead thing it&s;elf. The go&s;pel is as plainly written as the law, and our Lord's con&s;tant method of re|pelling &s;atan was by what is <HI>written;</HI> and when the tempter tried to en&s;nare him in the &s;ame way, he did not depart from it to my&s;tical meanings, but produced another text which detected his perver&s;ion of that. A great variety of improvements may be made of all parts of &s;cripture, while one con&s;i&s;tent meaning runs through the whole; and tho&s;e who venture to depart from that, know not what delu|&s;ions they may run into.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="012316_0019_0F8A20590D081328">
We always need the &s;pirit to enlighten our minds to under&s;tand the &s;criptures, but the rule is the &s;ame in the dark as in the light, and is the &s;ame in it&s;elf before we under&s;tand its u&s;e, as when we are be&s;t &s;killed therein; though without the light we can|not &s;ee it, and without being taught we cannot u&s;e it aright; what the Spirit does, is to give us light, &s;kill and &s;trength to u&s;e it as we ought. I know it is pleaded, that the &s;criptures know nothing of par|ticular per&s;ons and ca&s;es now, and that this want mu&s;t be &s;upplied by the Spirit, which therefore they would have to be a rule &s;uperior to the word. To which I reply, that the be&s;t laws of any &s;tate know nothing of the names and particular circum|&s;tances of thou&s;ands that are under them; yet when tho&s;e laws are well under&s;tood, and duly applied, they &s;erve well to &s;ettle the various ca&s;es that occur; or if in &s;ome ca&s;es they fail, it is be|cau&s;e human laws are imperfect; but the divine laws are not &s;o; they are <HI>perfect,</HI> and therefore are &s;ufficient <HI>thoroughly to furni&s;h the man of God unto all good works.</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16, 17. And the meek he will guide in judgment, and the meek he will teach his way; but to pretend that we have a rule within us that leads us in any re&s;pect contrary to God's written word, di&s;covers a temper as contrary to true meekne&s;s, as it would do for a judge to a&s;|&s;ume a power to di&s;pen&s;e with the king's laws, or to make new ones as the turn &s;uited.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e holy men that God employed to publi&s;h the New-te&s;tament as well as the old, he gave de|mon&s;tration to the world of their divine authority &s;o to do, and <HI>confirmed the word with &s;igns follow|ing,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="012316_0020_0F8A20598E33B630">Mar. 16.20. How great then mu&s;t be their delu&s;ion, if any imagine that the divine Spirit in them will teach them to judge or act contrary to what he formerly moved holy men to write! Yet are there not &s;ome even in this concour&s;e of people (for I mean to &s;peak plainly) that profe&s;s to be &s;o &s;piritual as not externally to regard &s;ome of the plain commands of Chri&s;t, who at the &s;ame time depend not on a righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought without them, but on what is wrought within them? But if we de|pend upon any inward frames or exerci&s;es as the matter of our ju&s;tification and acceptance with God, we as really build upon the letter as any formali&s;t in the world; all the difference lies in the mode of doing; for the letter is <HI>do and live,</HI> and the doing it requires is <HI>love</HI> to God and man, and a behavior agreable thereto, and who does not know that <HI>love</HI> has it's &s;eat within? So that inward doings are as plainly the letter as any thing that is outward, and to depend upon either of them is directly contrary to <HI>believing on Him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly.</HI></P>
<P>The law requires a right temper and behavior, and &s;ays, <HI>I will if they will,</HI> but gives no &s;uch thing; the go&s;pel reveals Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and gives the Spirit to write the law in our hearts with this tenor, <HI>I will and they &s;hall,</HI> Gal. 3.10&mdash; 14. Heb. 8.10. In the oldne&s;s of the letter the promi&s;e is always predicated upon &s;omething good in the creature; but the newne&s;s of the Spirit re&s;ts the promi&s;e intirely upon the merits of the Savior, and the truth of the promi&s;er; and hence ari&s;es that important di&s;tinction, which the apo&s;tle in&s;i&s;ts &s;o much upon, between <HI>debt</HI> and <HI>grace, wages</HI> and
<PB N="23" REF="012316_0021_0F8A205A4A669CE8"><HI>gift,</HI> Rom. 4.4, 5, 19. and 6.23. Heb. 11.11. And here I would ob&s;erve, that many greatly mi&s;take them&s;elves about holding to &s;alvation by grace. Becau&s;e the ble&s;&s;ings they hope to receive are of infinitely greater value than their doings, therefore they &s;uppo&s;e they hold to grace and not debt. But could Adam it he had &s;tood, or can any angel in heaven now, &s;uppo&s;e that there is any thing like an equal value between their be&s;t obedi|ence and mo&s;t devout &s;ervice, and eternal life? Surely no. Well then, according to this notion, all the favors be&s;towed by the Creator on men or angels, is all not debt but grace, and the apo&s;tles long talk of a di&s;tinction between them was all either impertinence or impo&s;ition! But if men would duly con&s;ider, they may know, that by the laws of men, where there is a fair promi&s;e made of a par|ticular &s;um upon a certain condition, if the condition is fulfilled, the law will oblige the promi&s;er to pay the &s;um, let it be ever &s;o much greater than the value of the condition that is performed. Debt is to <HI>pay</HI> what is engaged; and do not all know that a <HI>gift</HI> to the needy and mi&s;erable is quite another thing? And if any &s;hould come to beg for help, and yet &s;hould &s;o forget them&s;elves as to dictate to others how much to give, and al&s;o claim it as their right, in&s;tead of humbly a&s;king for it as a free fa|vour; would not men &s;oon di&s;cern the difference? How much more will not the &s;earcher of hearts do it?</P>
<P>Perhaps men blind them&s;elves in our day con|cerning this matter, as much under the word faith, as in any way whatever. When the word is u&s;ed
<PB N="24" REF="012316_0022_0F8A205BFB2B5AA8">about human affairs, it is as ea&s;ily under&s;tood as other words, but in religion &s;carce any are more contro|verted; and what can be the cau&s;e of it but it's being turned from it's proper meaning?</P>
<P>A&s;&s;ent to a report that comes with proper evi|dence of its truth, is the plain nature of faith, the influence the report has upon us is the effect or ex|erci&s;e of faith; but it is &s;uppo&s;ed by multitudes, that devils and hypocrites affent to the &s;ame truths the &s;aint does, and therefore that &s;omething more belongs to the nature of the &s;aint's faith than a&s;&s;ent to truth; but I humbly conceive that this is a great mi&s;take. The devils, and &s;ometimes wicked men, believe that there is one God that will puni&s;h &s;in|ners, &s;o as to make them tremble; yet there are two parts of truth on which our &s;alvation turns that they never have a&s;&s;ented to: One is, that the con|demning &s;entence again&s;t them is ju&s;t; the other is, that God can find in his heart to &s;ave tho&s;e who have nothing of their own but &s;in. The evidence of the&s;e truths &s;hine as clear in the &s;criptures, as the &s;un does in the firmament; but we have our Lord's own te&s;timony that, <HI>Every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved:</HI> And <HI>this is their condemnation,</HI> John 3.19, 20. Yet we have many ma&s;ters &s;ince Nicodemus's day who will dare to de|ny what our Lord here a&s;&s;erts. They allow it to be &s;o with many, but not with <HI>every one;</HI> the na|tural con&s;equence of which is, for them to &s;uppo&s;e it unju&s;t, for tho&s;e who have &s;ome good ideas and di&s;po&s;itions, not to have a better claim to &s;alvation than others; and from hence proceed the exclama|tions
<PB N="25" REF="012316_0023_0F8A205C83531EB8">we often hear, again&s;t the doctrine of &s;overeign grace, as making God unju&s;t, a re&s;pecter of per|&s;ons, &amp;c. Whereas if it were truly believed that we are every one condemned by a righteous &s;en|tence, there could be no room to complain of in|ju&s;tice if all were executed, nor to doubt of its be|ing intirely of grace if any were pardoned. And how ab&s;urd is it to imagine that God will pardon any one &s;oul till it comes to own his ju&s;tice? For without that they can never be truly reconciled to his government, nor he honored in their &s;alvation. And if &s;o, then how ab&s;urd are all tho&s;e notions (of which our world is full) that &s;inners in general be|lieve the go&s;pel to be true, but that they have a great deal to do in order to get its ble&s;&s;ings applied to them! For all doings <HI>before</HI> reconciliation are a putting off for the pre&s;ent, and if they believed they were ju&s;tly condemned, how could they bear with delay le&s;t the door &s;hould be &s;hut again&s;t them forever. And if they believed that God &s;peaks the truth when he proclaims pardon to the <HI>chief of &s;inners, what duties could they do before they re|ceived his te&s;timony, and &s;et to their &s;eal that he is true?</HI></P>
<P>If a man that is under &s;entence of death &s;hould &s;lip from his confinement, and do ever &s;o much in hopes of being again received as a good &s;ubject, don't all men know that his doings can never be true <HI>obedience</HI> to the authority that condemned him, till that authority either rever&s;es the &s;entence, or grants him a pardon? And now let us &s;ee what &s;ort of faith tho&s;e people have, who are not ready to come to Chri&s;t now, yet &s;ay they are <HI>&s;triving</HI> for
<PB N="26" REF="012316_0024_0F8A206146790738">if, and hope to obtain it hereafter. Why indeed they believe there is a dangerous &s;entence out again&s;t them, and they fear they &s;hould &s;tand a poor chance to come as they are, but they hope by and by to get ready for a re-hearing, and hope then to make it appear that the Judge was mi&s;taken in his &s;en|tence, and that though they had been drawn into &s;ome very di&s;agreable things, yet that they are now &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, that they <HI>ought</HI> to be re|ceived to <HI>mercy!</HI> The&s;e are notable notions of faith, of ju&s;tice, and of grace! O &s;inner, be not deceived! All &s;uch attempts will &s;ucceed no better than the wife of Jereboam did, in <HI>feigning</HI> her&s;elf to be <HI>ano|ther</HI> per&s;on, 1 Kings 14.5&mdash;14.</P>
<P>Thus I think it plainly appears that no unrenew|ed &s;oul truly believes that God is either ju&s;t or gracious, nor ever will by all the power of moral &s;ua&s;ion; nothing can produce this faith but that <HI>creating</HI> power that in the beginning &s;aid, "Let there be <HI>light,</HI> and there was <HI>light:</HI>" Fir&s;t, the light of the law which <HI>kills</HI> all the &s;inner's vain hopes; and then the light of the go&s;pel, which opens the true door of hope through Him who has fulfilled the law. Our natural attachment to our doings, the apo&s;tle compares to a woman's being wedded to an hu&s;band, who&s;e authority is <HI>binding</HI> upon her as long as they both live; and he ob&s;erves that it would be <HI>adultery</HI> for her to marry another before her fir&s;t hu&s;band was dead; from whence he &s;hews that we cannot be married to Chri&s;t until the law is dead to us, and we to that; and in explaining his meaning he is very careful to &s;ecure the honor of the law, that it is <HI>holy, ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>good;</HI> but when a
<PB N="27" REF="012316_0025_0F8A20616449B7F8">&s;urety has fully an&s;wered for a debt or crime, that action is <HI>dead</HI> to the debtor or criminal, &s;o that a ju&s;t law cannot hurt him for it, any more than the dead can hurt the living; hence this death or di&s;&s;olution of the marriage tie between us and the law, is by the <HI>body of Chri&s;t.</HI> His bearing our <HI>&s;ins in his own body on the tree,</HI> took away the power of the law to condemn us, and a view of our &s;ins, and of him who atoned for them, turns the heart from &s;in and from &s;eeking life by our do|ings, to tru&s;t in and unite our hearts with <HI>Him who is rai&s;ed from the dead, that we &s;hould bring forth fruit unto God:</HI> Our life is &s;till to be directed by the &s;ame law of love to God and man, only it is changed into other hands, we are <HI>under law to Chri&s;t</HI> our new hu&s;band. And it is well known that when a woman is married the law mu&s;t come upon her hu&s;band for all her debts, and that &s;he is to look to him for all &s;he wants, and to be under his government: So here we are to &s;erve him in <HI>newne&s;s of &s;pirit,</HI> and not in the <HI>oldne&s;s of the letter.</HI></P>
<P>The oldne&s;s of the letter promi&s;es life upon do|ing, but gives no &s;trength to do; the newne&s;s of the &s;pirit &s;ays, as thy days is thy &s;trength &s;hall be; come boldly to the throne of grace for help in time of need. The oldne&s;s of the letter gives no en|couragement to come only upon our doing, and &s;ets a flaming &s;word in the way of the guilty; but the newne&s;s of the &s;pirit directs us to take all our encouragement to come, from the merits, compa&s;&s;ion, interce&s;&s;ion and promi&s;e of our hu&s;band, who has engaged <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>faithfulne&s;s</HI> to <HI>forgive</HI> the guil|ty,

Upon the whole, that teaching which enjoins duty upon us as the condition of our obtaining favor of God, be that duty called repentance, faith, or whatever it may, is legality; that which would abate the law to bring it down to our ability is inju&s;tice; that which tends to relea&s;e us from our obligation, till al|mighty grace appears for our deliverance, is licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s; but that teaching which opens the holy nature and authority of God's law over us, &s;hewing how we are all condemned thereby, and then the help there is freely proclaimed to every one in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the fullne&s;s there is in him to en|able the believer to perfect holine&s;s in the fear of God, is evangelical; therefore let each &s;oul take heed what he hears.</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That a vi&s;ible church-&s;tate with it's order and government, is not an invention of men, but the appointment of God. Therefore,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That tho&s;e who rightly join therein, join them&s;elves <HI>to Him,</HI> who is both able and faithful to carry them through all that he calls them to do or &s;uffer in his cau&s;e. Hence,</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="30" REF="012316_0028_0F8A20654438FE60">
3. There can never be any ju&s;t excu&s;e for one &s;oul to de&s;ert this cau&s;e while HE remain what HE is.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;uch &s;elf-evident truths that it might &s;eem an affront to your under&s;tandings to &s;tand long to prove them, yet through our darkne&s;s they are &s;o often forgotten, and that forgetfulne&s;s is pro|ductive of &s;o many mi&s;chiefs, that I pre&s;ume you will not deem it un&s;ea&s;onable thus to &s;tir up your pure minds by way of remembrance. A due re|gard to the&s;e points would prevent what has often happened, of per&s;ons joining with a church in its pro&s;perity, and de&s;erting it in adver&s;ity, being &s;ond of comfort, but backward to do their duty. And a ju&s;t view of the&s;e truths would prevent per&s;ons joining to the church when they do not to the Lord. We read when Ananias and his wife were &s;truck dead for their deceit, that of the re&s;t dur&s;t no man join him&s;elf <HI>to them;</HI> but believers were <HI>the more added to the Lord,</HI> Acts 5.13, 14. Viewing things in this light would keep people from tru&s;ting their religion to their mini&s;ter, without &s;eeing with their own eyes, on the one hand; or on the other, ri&s;ing in re&s;entment again&s;t them becau&s;e they will not do for gods. Paul &s;ays, we have this trea&s;ure in <HI>earthen ve&s;&s;els,</HI> that the excellency of the power may be <HI>of God,</HI> and <HI>not of us;</HI> and who was ever &s;o &s;tupid as to think a ve&s;&s;el could &s;eed them with|out new &s;upplies, or to quarrel with it becau&s;e they found it empty; would they not rather carry it to the &s;tore that it might be filled again? Well, my Brethren, if you will do &s;o with your mini&s;ters, it will learn you the true difference, between having
<PB N="31" REF="012316_0029_0F8A206714C78CB0">a man's <HI>per&s;on</HI> in admiration becau&s;e of advantage, and e&s;teeming him highly in love for his <HI>works &s;ake.</HI> Again, if we are truly joined to the Lord, we have a friend at hand to open our griefs to, and to roll our burdens upon, which may keep us from the error of many, who being burdened with their brother, whi&s;per it to this, that and the other, in|&s;tead of acting according to divine rule with him. Prov. 25.9. Matt. 18.15&mdash;17. If we viewed Him who walks in the mid&s;t of his churches, with eyes like a flame of fire, how would it keep us from complaining of our brethren, without being faith|ful to them? Since he has given clear direction therein, how churches are to be faithful to their members, and members to churches, that have &s;trayed, &s;o as either to recover them, or to clear our &s;elves of them, if they will not be reformed. In &s;hort, when the&s;e truths are duly remembred they will make mini&s;ters faithful to their people, and people faithful to their mini&s;ters, for their obli|gations are mutual; and the right performance of every duty toward each other, is &s;erving the Lord Chri&s;t; and when mini&s;ters view how they owe their all to Him, how gladly will they &s;pend and be &s;pent in his cau&s;e? And the &s;ame view will make people as glad to di&s;charge their duty towards their mini&s;ters, and towards each other. There|fore, let us hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of our faith with|out wavering (for he is faithful that promi&s;ed) and let us con&s;ider one another to provoke unto love, and to good works; not for&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves together, as the manner of &s;ome is; but exhorting one another, and &s;o much the more, as ye &s;ee the day approaching!</P>
