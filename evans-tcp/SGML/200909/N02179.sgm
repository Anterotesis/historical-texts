<HEAD><HI>Sober REMARKS</HI> On a BOOK, Entituled, <HI>A Mode&s;t Proof of the Order &amp; Government &s;ettled by Christ &amp; His Apo&s;tles in the Church;</HI> In a Letter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I HAVE receiv'd and read the Book you lately &s;ent me, entituled, <HI>A Mode&s;t Proof,</HI> &amp;c; in which the Au|thor's profe&s;s'd De&s;ign is, <HI>to repre&s;ent to the World what was the Primitive Model or Form of Church-Government; what was &s;ettled by our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles, in this point, and that from what is re|corded of the Matter in the Books of the New-Te&s;tament.</HI> Pag. 1.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve the Book is &s;aid to be <HI>Re printed</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> &amp;c. I don't remember, that I ever &s;aw any former Edition, nor had I opportunity to peru&s;e this, till you were plea&s;ed to put your Book into my hands, de&s;iring my Thoughts upon it. And in return to you, I mu&s;t &s;ay, after an impartial unprejudic'd Peru&s;al, I am far from thinking, that the Gentleman hath made a ju&s;t Repre&s;entation of the <HI>Form of Church-Government &s;ettled by our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles;</HI> or, that he hath been able in any mea&s;ure to prove <HI>his own Model</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002594_0005_0FDB7DE4B5581508">
from <HI>what is recorded in the Books of the New Te&s;tament.</HI> I can by no means joyn with the <HI>Publi&s;her,</HI> who in his Preface is pleas'd to call the Author's Arguments <HI>convincing;</HI> and yet I am &s;en&s;ible the Book is, for the mo&s;t part, plau&s;ibly written, and &s;eems likely enough to draw unwary Per&s;ons into the &s;ame unhappy Mi&s;takes, that the Author him&s;elf labours of. I &s;hould therefore have thought it a piece of good Service, if upon the Book's fir&s;t coming forth, any Body had pre&s;ently follow'd it with a &s;uitable An&s;wer. And I &s;uppo&s;e, an An&s;wer would have been given to it, with convenient &s;peed, if it had not happen'd in <HI>this,</HI> as it often does in other ca&s;es of the <HI>like</HI> nature, that even tho&s;e who wi&s;h the Work done, are loath to be them&s;elves the doers of it, and wait and hope that &s;ome other Per&s;on of better Capacity, or more Lei&s;ure, will undertake it.&mdash;But now &s;ince the Book hath been &s;uf|fered (whether for this or for any other Rea&s;ons) to pa&s;s for &s;everal Months without any An&s;wer, perhaps &s;ome may be di&s;pos'd to que&s;tion whether it be expedient to take no|tice of it, at this di&s;tance of Time, and at &s;uch a Juncture.</P>
<P>However, Since (I ob&s;erve) the Book is <HI>recommended as proper to be put into the hands of the Laity;</HI> &s;ince (you tell me) Numbers of Copies have been indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;pers'd through the Town and Country; and this Author (I hear) is glory'd in as unan&s;werable; and &s;ome unwary Readers (as I &s;aid) it's probable enough, may be captivated with the &s;pecious &s;hew of <HI>Scripture</HI>-Argument he brings: Upon the&s;e Con&s;ide|rations, I cannot but incline to agree with you in thinking it convenient, and not yet out of &s;ea&s;on, to defend our &s;elves, and <HI>put into the hands of the Laity</HI> &s;ome ju&s;t and proper Re|marks on the Treati&s;e lately recommended to them. For, it's better to run the hazard of a few &s;evere Cen&s;ures, than by a criminal &s;ilence to betray &s;o important an Intere&s;t as we are engag'd in, and tamely &s;uffer any of our too un|thinking Children or Neighbours to be &s;educed from what we look upon to be <HI>the Order of the Go&s;pel.</HI> Therefore, altho' I might very well excu&s;e my &s;elf from the Task you urge me to, by pleading the better ability of others to undertake it, and the pre&s;&s;ure of my own Affairs, which require my utmo&s;t Diligence and Application; yet being &s;en&s;ible that others will be ready to make the &s;ame Excu&s;es, I am not willing that the con&s;ideration of any private Inconveniencies &s;hou'd di&s;courage me from attempting to do a publick Service.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002594_0006_0FDB7DE861049360">In compliance then with your repeated De&s;ires, I &s;hall endeavour now (in the fear of GOD and by His Help) to point out, and confute the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Errors in the Book you &s;ent me: I &s;ay the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, becau&s;e I don't intend to wa&s;t my own Time, or exerci&s;e your Patience with Remarks upon every thing of &s;maller Con&s;quence, that is liable to exception in our Author; but &s;hall only take notice of &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages as &s;eem mo&s;t likely to lead his Rea|ders into wrong Notions, in matters of importance: of which &s;ort I &s;hall mention four or five, before I come to that, which is the great De&s;ign of the Book.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> is in <HI>Page</HI> 2d. Where he &s;ays, <HI>That the Church, however</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>di&s;quieted, &mdash; yet heard little or no noi&s;e made for above</HI> 1400 <HI>Years about this point of Church-Government,</HI> &s;ave that <HI>one</HI> AERIUS <HI>&s;tarted a Debate, but had &s;o few to &s;econd him, that it died with him&s;elf and left his Name on Record among</HI> HERETICKS.&mdash; Here it's worth while to enquire, <HI>WHO</HI> it was that rank'd him among <HI>Hereticks</HI> for his o|pinion about Church Government? Why truly <HI>Epiphanius</HI> was the fir&s;t; who is generally ob&s;erv'd to have been too warm in his Temper, and ra&s;h in his Cen&s;ures, tho' otherwi&s;e a worthy good Man.&mdash; And then was it <HI>only</HI> for this opinion, that he condemn'd <HI>Aerius?</HI> No indeed; but he charg'd him with <HI>Here&s;y</HI> in another Point (which may well render that Father's Judgment &s;u&s;pected.) It was his a&s;&s;erting the <HI>Unlawfulne&s;s</HI> of <HI>praying</HI> for the <HI>Dead. Aerius</HI> appear'd <HI>again&s;t</HI> this Super&s;tition; and <HI>Epiphanius</HI> (a Defender of it) <HI>therefore</HI> call'd him a <HI>Heretick.</HI>&mdash; The Truth is (as one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tong</HI>'s Defence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Pag. 30, 31.</NOTE> ob&s;erves) the&s;e two <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> of <HI>Aerius</HI> concerning the <HI>Parity of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;sbyters,</HI> and the <HI>Unlawfulne&s;s of praying for the Dead,</HI> are much of the <HI>&s;ame Nature;</HI> and <HI>Epiphanius</HI>'s Confutation of them both, equally <HI>Learned</HI> and <HI>Satisfactory:</HI> for it is ob&s;er|vable, that in the &s;ame place where he condemns that <HI>mon|&s;trous Here&s;y</HI> of the <HI>Identity of Order,</HI> He fairly confe&s;&s;es, <Q>That by the two Orders of <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Offices might be performed</Q>&mdash; What need then of the <HI>Prelate,</HI> &s;o fiercely contended for? To this I &s;hall only add the Words of Learned Bi&s;hop <HI>Stilling fleet,</HI> who &s;ays, If <HI>Aerius</HI> was a <HI>Heretick</HI> for holding the <HI>Identity of Order,</HI> it is &s;trange that <HI>Epiphanius</HI> &s;hould be the fir&s;t Man that &s;hould charge
<PB N="4" REF="002594_0007_0FDB7DEB73AFE348">
him with it; and that neither <HI>Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret,</HI> nor <HI>Evagrius,</HI> before who&s;e time he liv'd, &s;hould <HI>cen&s;ure</HI> him for it And why &s;hou'd not <HI>Jerom</HI> have been equally animad|verted upon, who is as expre&s;s in this, as any Man in the World? &mdash; "As to the matter it &s;elf (&s;ays the Bi&s;hop) I believe upon the &s;tricte&s;t Inquiry, <HI>Medina</HI>'s Judg|ment will prove true, that <HI>Jerom, Au&s;tin, Ambro&s;e, Sedulius, Prima&s;ius, Chry&s;o&s;tom, Theodoret, Theophylact,</HI> were all of <HI>Aerius</HI>'s Judgment, as to the <HI>Identity</HI> of both <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> in the Primitive Church <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Iren.</HI> pag. 276, 277.</NOTE> &mdash; To the&s;e, it is certain, the Bi&s;hop might truly have prefixed the Names of <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Polycarp,</HI> two of the mo&s;t ancient and venerable among the <HI>Fathers.</HI> But at this rate &s;o many of the <HI>Fathers</HI> (and tho&s;e too of the highe&s;t e&s;teem and note) will be branded with <HI>Here&s;y,</HI> that we &s;hall never know hereafter, when we may lay any Stre&s;s upon the Judg|ment and Authority of <HI>Fathers.</HI> It was therefore hone&s;tly &amp; wi&s;ely done by our <HI>Author,</HI> not to meddle with <HI>them</HI> in the pre&s;ent <HI>Controver&s;y,</HI> but to found his <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed Proof</HI> wholly upon the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> of who&s;e <HI>Authority</HI> there can be no &s;u&s;pi|cion. <HI>Scripture Evidence</HI> be&s;ure is &s;ufficient; and will be con|vincing to us for ever. And if our <HI>Author</HI>'s ill Succe&s;s in this Attempt, don't prove too great a <HI>Di&s;couragement,</HI> I hope that others of his own Church will (for the time to come) imitate the good Example he hath &s;et them, in keeping clo&s;e to the <HI>Scriptures;</HI> and not make the <HI>Fathers</HI> their Refuge on all occa&s;ions and place their confidence in them; who can by no means be allowed to be a certain foundation to build upon, <HI>Since</HI> (as Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;erv. against Popery.</NOTE> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves) <HI>they many times contradict them&s;elves and one another;</HI> So that (he tells us) it has often made him &s;mile, with a mixture of Pity and In|dignation, to &s;ee what a great noi&s;e <HI>Roman</HI> Di&s;putants make among <HI>Women</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> and the <HI>meanest</HI> &s;ort of People, with <HI>Quotations</HI> out of <HI>Fathers</HI> &amp; <HI>Councils;</HI> whom they pre|tend to be all on their &s;ide".&mdash; But were the <HI>Authority</HI> of <HI>Fathers</HI> of ten times greater weight than it is, yet but very few, even among the <HI>Learned,</HI> (e&s;pecially in this remote part of the Earth) ever had any opportunity fully to inform them&s;elves, what <HI>their</HI> Judgment was. And I can never think it wi&s;e or &s;afe to put a <HI>Controver&s;y</HI> of any importance, on &s;uch a Foot, as that a few <HI>Learned Men</HI> may contradict
<PB N="5" REF="002594_0008_0FDB7DECF900ED10">
one another at plea&s;ure, and all the World be&s;ide want either <HI>Learning, Books</HI> or <HI>Lei&s;ure,</HI> to examine thereby who &s;peaks the <HI>Truth,</HI> and who denies it</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, with re&s;pect to the foregoing Pa&s;&s;age, that as all the <HI>Fathers</HI> abovementioned were plainly of opi|nion, that <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> &amp; <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> were not two di&s;tinct <HI>Orders,</HI> nor inve&s;ted with any different <HI>Powers,</HI> by Divine In&s;titution; and as many other <HI>Fathers</HI> might have the &s;ame Senti|ments, who have not le&s;t their Opinions upon Record about it; and as &s;carce any Body of great Antiquity (except &s;uch who&s;e <HI>Writings</HI> are known to have been &s;hamefully cor|rupted) &s;o much as <HI>&s;eems</HI> to be otherwi&s;e minded; &s;o it is very certain, that almo&s;t the whole <HI>Christian Church,</HI> both <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> &amp; <HI>Popi&s;h,</HI> were of the &s;ame opinion, about the time of the <HI>Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT the Mind of the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> then was, may be learn'd from Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Reformation,</HI> which tells us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 1. pag. 366.</NOTE>, <HI>That it was the common Style of the Age,</HI> to reckon Prie&s;ts <HI>and Bi&s;hops as the &s;ame Office:</HI> &mdash;and from Dr. <HI>Willet</HI>'s <HI>Synop&s;is Papi&s;mi</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pag. 269, 272, 281. <HI>Edit. Anno</HI> 1630.</NOTE>, where he proves from the <HI>Papal Decrees,</HI> that the Romani&s;ts held <HI>all Mini&s;ters indifferently to be the Apo&s;tles Succe&s;&s;ors.</HI></P>
<P>Again, THAT the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> whether of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> or of <HI>Foreign Churches,</HI> were all agreed in the &s;ame Opinion, is no le&s;s certain, what&s;oever our <HI>Author</HI> may &s;ug|ge&s;t to the contrary.</P>
<P>AS for the <HI>Church of England,</HI> the Generality of it's Bi&s;hops and Divines, from the beginning of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> for a long while ('tis well known) expre&s;ly <HI>di&s;claimed</HI> the Nece&s;&s;ity and Divine Right of Dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy; and own'd the <HI>Foreign Churches,</HI> who were without it, to be <HI>true Churches</HI> of CHRIST.</P>
<P>IN the Days of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, when Things were tending to a <HI>Reformation,</HI> The Book entituled, <HI>The In&s;titution of the Chri&s;tian Man</HI> (which was compiled by the Body of the Clergy, approved by both Hou&s;es of Parliament, and Pub|li&s;h'd by the King's Command) expre&s;ly &s;ays, <HI>In Novo Te&s;ta|mento nulla mentio facta est aliorum Graduum aut Di&s;tinctimum in Ordinibus, &s;ed Diaconorum vel Mini&s;trorum, et Pre&s;byterorum &s;ive Epi&s;coporum:</HI> That is, <Q>In the New-Te&s;tament, theres no mention of any other Degrees or Di&s;tinctions in <HI>Orders,</HI>

<P>I think the&s;e Things are &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy any Man, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> never pretended Dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy to be of Divine In&s;titution, before the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t.

<P>I &s;hall only add here; I cannot learn whether there has been even in <HI>England,</HI> to this very Day, properly any publick and expre&s;s <HI>A&s;&s;ertion</HI> of the <HI>Divine</HI> Right of Prelacy, either by Parliament or Convocation.

And yet our Author is plea&s;ed to &s;ay (Page 3d) That at the Reformation <HI>the greate&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the Re|formed Church, retained the ancient Order &amp; Government:</HI> which indeed is very true, it rightly under&s;tood; but if he means (as, if he intends any thing to his purpo&s;e by it, he mu&s;t mean) to per&s;wade his Readers, that the greate&s;t part of the Reformed Churches retained <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> as an Order of Men by <HI>Divine In&s;titution</HI> di&s;tinct from and &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters.

That in &s;ome of the Foreign Prote&s;tant Churches <HI>Titular Bi|&s;hops</HI> were, and &s;till are retained.

<P>IN fine, Let me add a Hint relating to the Church of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> which is too excellent a Branch of the Reformation to be omitted. Great Pains have been taken by &s;ome to make the fir&s;t Reformation there look as if it had been <HI>Epi&s;copal;</HI> be|cau&s;e for a while there were <HI>Bi&s;hops;</HI> and becau&s;e there were <HI>Superintendents</HI> appointed for the Direction of the <HI>Church-Affairs.</HI> But if we look into the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of tho&s;e Times, we &s;hall find that the Bi&s;hops were <HI>obtruded</HI> upon the Church, by the <HI>Court;</HI> and the Superintendents were only a <HI>temporary Expedient,</HI> for the nece&s;&s;ity of the Day, appointed by &s;uch too as were mo&s;t Anti-Epi&s;copal in their Judgment. And (what is worth ob|&s;erving) the Superintendants and Bi&s;hops were both in &s;ub|jection to the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> of Mini&s;ters. &mdash; So that notwith|&s;tanding <HI>them,</HI> it appears that at the Reformation the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was <HI>Anti-Prelatical.</HI> They that would &s;ee this matter argu'd, may con&s;ult the Learned Mr. <HI>Jame&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Nazi|anzeni Querela</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Part 1.

in the con&s;ideration of that, by turning a&s;ide to examin any incidental Pa&s;&s;ages foreign to it. The Thing I refer to is what our <HI>Author</HI> tells us, Page 12.

<P>THE Office, which <HI>Philip</HI> was promoted to, was that of an <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> We read (Act. 21.8.) <HI>of Philip the Evangeli&s;t, which was one of the seven,</HI> that is, one of the &s;even that were appointed to <HI>&s;erve Tables,</HI> Act. 6. <HI>Philip,</HI> who was <HI>originally</HI> a Deacon in proce&s;s of time, and it's like pretty &s;oon became an <HI>Evangeli&s;t.</HI> Having for &s;ome time <HI>u&s;ed the Office of a Deacon well, He purcha&s;ed to him&s;elf a good Degree,</HI> and merited a higher Station in the Church. Our Author owns the <HI>Deacons</HI> to be inferior to Presbyters; to the <HI>&s;eventy and others of their Order</HI> (as he &s;peaks) who he &s;ays go by the name of <HI>Prophets</HI> in a Go&s;|pel &s;en&s;e, <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the Word: <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> &amp; <HI>Teachers,</HI> and <HI>Evan|gelists</HI> &mdash; All the&s;e he makes to be but various Appellations of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Order of Men, that is, <HI>Presbyters;</HI> as will appear to every one that reads his 13th and 14th Pages, however incon&s;i&s;tently he may afterwards expre&s;s him&s;elf. He makes the&s;e <HI>Teachers &amp; Evangeli&s;ts</HI> to be a <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> Office and Order from the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and from the <HI>Deacons: inferior</HI> to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to the <HI>Deacons,</HI> as in the Pages refer'd to. Now this Gentleman lays it down for an indi&s;putable Maxim el&s;e|where (pag 13, &amp; 56) That altho' all <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were <HI>Pre&s;|byters</HI> and <HI>Deacons;</HI> the &s;uperior Office or Order <HI>including</HI> the inferior; yet not <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> Every Teacher (he tells us)
<PB N="14" REF="002594_0017_0FDB7DFFB6D7EEA8">
was not an Apo&s;tle: We may add; Nor was every Deacon a Teacher, by the &s;ame Rule, the inferior Order or Office not including the &s;uperior. According to his own Principles then, at the time when <HI>Philip</HI> is &s;tyl'd an <HI>Evangeli&s;t,</HI> he mu&s;t be a <HI>Presbyter</HI> (or of the Order of the &s;eventy; and &s;o <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to a Deacon. And it is more that probable, that <HI>Philip</HI> received his preferment <HI>before</HI> his going abroad, and di&s;pen&s;ing the Word and Sacraments in <HI>Samaria.</HI> What tho' there's no mention made of any <HI>&s;econd Ordination</HI> he had for this End? Yet &s;ince he is expre&s;ly <HI>call'd</HI> an <HI>Evangeli&s;t,</HI> and did the <HI>Work</HI> of an Evangeli&s;t; our <HI>Author</HI>'s own Principles will oblige him to &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>Deacon</HI> did not <HI>of his own Head,</HI> take upon him to execute the higher Office of an <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> or Prophet; but was impower'd by &s;ome <HI>new</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> (who had before ordain'd him a Deacon) or el&s;e that he had an <HI>extraordinary</HI> and im|mediate Call from GOD. And let him chu&s;e which of the&s;e he will, it is equally de&s;tructive to the Pretences of his <HI>Epi&s;|copal Deacon,</HI> who (by virtue of an Ordination to this inferior Office only) pre&s;umes to <HI>Bapti&s;e</HI> &amp; <HI>Preach:</HI> Works, no ways belonging to his Office, and what truly a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Deacon (However de&s;pis'd by the Adver&s;ary, and however they &s;hould &s;coff at him for any &s;uch Pretences) might perform as <HI>war|rantably</HI> as the <HI>Church of England</HI> Deacon. I have &s;ome where met with this Saying of a High-flying Worthy, That a <HI>preach|ing Bi&s;hop</HI> is a <HI>prating Coxcomb.</HI> Methinks this might with much more propriety be apply'd to the preaching <HI>Deacon;</HI> a thing which the Scriptures know nothing of. I am &s;ure there's no Countenance for it from the Ca&s;e of <HI>Philip.</HI> Much le&s;s from the Ca&s;e of <HI>Stephen,</HI> the Proto-Martyr; for, &s;uppo&s;e <HI>him</HI> to have done all that <HI>Philip</HI> did, we mu&s;t conclude then he had the like Preferment, and did not act in the Capacity of a <HI>Deacon</HI> (or an Officer inferior to a Presbyter) but of a <HI>Mini&s;ter of the Word,</HI> as well as <HI>Philip.</HI>&mdash; Yet &s;ince <HI>Stephen</HI> did nothing but what (con&s;idering the extraordinary Gifts and Graces which many other Believers be&s;ides Mini&s;ters, had in tho&s;e Days; I &s;ay, &s;ince he did nothing but what) a common Chri&s;tian, in the like ca&s;e, might have done, the Ar|gument from him appears &s;o much the weaker and more groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>I'm &s;ure the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of the Primitive <HI>In&s;titution</HI> of Deacons, in the 6th Chap. of <HI>Acts,</HI> makes very clearly <HI>against</HI> the <HI>preach|ing</HI> Deacon. The Evidence there again&s;t him &s;hines &s;o bright
<PB N="15" REF="002594_0018_0FDB7E01380D1B18">
at the very fir&s;t View, that it is a wonder how any who are not Slaves to an Hypothe&s;is, can ever li&s;p a Word in his Favour. It is very obvious, The Apo&s;tles (who had hitherto &s;u&s;tained that Care chiefly) judged the <HI>&s;erving of Tables</HI> an intolerable Burden to them, and what they cou'd not attend without neg|lecting too much their better and more proper Work, the Mini&s;try of the Word. <HI>It is not Rea&s;on</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>that we &s;hould leave the Word of GOD, and &s;erve Tables.</HI> And therefore they in&s;tituted an inferior Order of Men, to attend THIS BUSINESS (of &s;erving Tables) that &s;o the Preachers of the Go&s;pel (being di&s;charged from this heavy incumbrance) might <HI>give them&s;elves continually to Prayer and to the Mini&s;try of the Word;</HI> which being e&s;&s;ential parts of the Mini&s;terial Of|fice, they dur&s;t not delegate the&s;e (however difficult) unto others to perform for them. From whence we may very rea&s;onably conclude, when <HI>Philip</HI> was <HI>&s;ent by the Spirit to preach &amp; bapti&s;e,</HI> that he was unloaded of his former cares and labours as a <HI>Deacon,</HI> in order to his more clo&s;ely attending to his new Work: and <HI>&s;ome other</HI> Per&s;on, doubtle&s;s was ordained (if there were occa&s;ion for it) to <HI>&s;erve Tables</HI> in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>AND yet further to confirm my point, we may ob&s;erve, that the Apo&s;tolical <HI>Directions</HI> concerning Deacons, exactly <HI>Harmonize</HI> with the Tenour of the In&s;titution. In 1 Epi&s;t. to <HI>Tim.</HI> 3 Chap. the Apo&s;tle gives &s;ome Rules about Deacons, and &s;tates their nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">ing with <HI>Acts</HI> 6.3.) none of which have any &s;pecial or immediate Reference to the Work of <HI>Preaching:</HI> altho' in the &s;ame Chapter where the Apo&s;tle is de&s;cribing the other Order of Men, the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> or Presbyters, he &s;ets it down as one e&s;&s;ential &s;troke in their Character, that they be <HI>apt to teach (able to teach others, and by &s;ound Doctrine both to exhort and convince the Gain&s;avers,</HI> as he el&s;ewhere explains him&s;elf) which we may well a&s;&s;ure our &s;elves, wou'd have been pre&s;cribed as a nece&s;&s;ary qualification of a <HI>Deacon</HI> likewi&s;e, if it had been the Will of GOD, that <HI>Deacons</HI> &s;hould ordinarily be <HI>Preachers</HI> of the Word. But in &s;tead of that, He only requires that tho&s;e of this Order &s;hould be Men of Piety, Prudence, Gravity, Temperance, Genero&s;ity and the like.&mdash; I hope therefore none of our <HI>Deacons,</HI> that are Ordained (as I wi&s;h they all were when they have <HI>fir&s;t been proved</HI>) will be drawn to doubt, whether they be of <HI>A|po&s;tolical Institution,</HI> only becau&s;e they are not called upon to Preach; &s;ince 'tis plain it never was the Will of GOD they
<PB N="16" REF="002594_0019_0FDB7E055EE20568">
&s;hould, but that they give them&s;elves to the <HI>Mini&s;try of Tables,</HI> the <HI>Lord's</HI> Table and the <HI>Poor</HI>'s; as the Church of <HI>England</HI> in her Ordination, having reference to this &s;pecial Office, explains it; declaring there, <HI>That it appertains to the Deacon</HI>'s <HI>Office to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Presbyter in di&s;tribution of the Elements, gladly &amp; willingly to &s;earch for the Poor the Sick &amp; Impotent, that they may be relieved:</HI> Praying <HI>that they may be mode&s;t, humble, and con&s;tant in their Mini&s;tration</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Contin.</HI> of <HI>Pool</HI>'s Annotat. on Phil. 1.1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But thus much for the <HI>Deacons.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed now to con&s;ider with <HI>our Author,</HI> the <HI>Order and Government &s;etled by CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles in the Church.</HI> In which the Gentleman's principal de&s;ign is to prove, that there were two di&s;tinct Orders of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters in&s;tituted by CHRIST him&s;elf; a <HI>Superior Order</HI> now commonly called <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> inve&s;ted with <HI>Authority</HI> to <HI>govern</HI> the Church, and <HI>or|dain</HI> proper Officers in it, as well as to preach the <HI>Word</HI> and admini&s;ter the <HI>Sacraments:</HI> and an <HI>inferior Order,</HI> commonly called <HI>Presbyters,</HI> who are in&s;tituted only to preach the <HI>Word,</HI> and admini&s;ter the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> and had no power of <HI>Ordination</HI> or <HI>Juri&s;diction</HI> committed to them I &s;ay this is his principal de&s;ign; for as to the <HI>Order of Deacons,</HI> which was in&s;tituted by the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> he well ob&s;erves, pag. 13 <HI>That there is no debate about them;</HI> &s;ave in the point that hath already been con&s;idered; <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the <HI>Deacons</HI> were by their Ordination inve&s;ted with Authority to preach and bapti&s;e, which (I &s;uppo&s;e) I have &s;ufficiently proved they have not.</P>
<P>IN pro&s;ecution of what I have &s;aid to be our Author's great De&s;ign, he refers us to the <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> fir&s;t of the <HI>Twelve,</HI> Luke 9. and afterwards of the <HI>Seventy,</HI> Luke 10. Upon which he truly ob&s;erves pag. 10. <HI>That they were both &s;ent forth with the</HI> SAME <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion, and the</HI> SAME <HI>Power to preach the Go&s;pel, to ca&s;t out Devils, to heal Di&s;ea&s;es, and almo&s;t in all things with the &s;ame In&s;tructions concerning their Conduct.</HI> And yet he tells us, pag. 11. <HI>That it is mo&s;t certain they were two di&s;tinct Orders of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>BUT upon what, the pretended Difference of Order between them can be founded, I mu&s;t confe&s;s it is not ea&s;y to me to con|ceive. Yet to confirm this Point by Te&s;timony, he tells us, page 10. That <HI>Calvin</HI> &s;cruples not to call the 70, <HI>in Dignity le&s;s than the Apo&s;tles, next in Office to them,</HI> &amp;c. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved
<PB N="17" REF="002594_0020_0FDB7E07F7609AF0">
here that in this he <HI>impo&s;es</HI> on his Readers; for <HI>Calvin</HI> is there de&s;cribing <HI>Evangeli&s;ts;</HI> of whom he affirms roundly that they were inferior to the Apo&s;tles; but he mentions the 70 only <HI>tran&s;iently</HI> and &s;peaks <HI>doubtfully</HI> of then &s;ubordination to the Twelve. Per <HI>Evangeli&s;tas,</HI> eos intelligo, qui quum dig|nitate e&s;&s;ent Apo&s;tolis minores, &amp;c. Quales fuerunt <HI>Lucas, Timotheur,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>ac</HI> FORTASSIS <HI>etiam &s;eptuaginta Di&s;cipuli, quos &s;ecundo ah Apo&s;tolis loco Chri&s;tus de&s;ignavit.</HI> He only &s;ays of the 70 Di&s;ciples, that they were appointed <HI>after</HI> the Apo|&s;tles, (referring to the <HI>time</HI> of their <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> not the <HI>degree</HI> of their <HI>Dignity;</HI> as &s;eems evident from the &s;cope of the place) and that <HI>perhaps</HI> they were <HI>inferiour</HI> to them.</P>
<P>AND whereas our <HI>Author</HI> mentions two In&s;tances of a difference in the Mi&s;&s;ion of the 12 from that of the 70, <HI>viz.</HI> Their more &s;olemn <HI>Inauguration</HI> to their Office, and their being particularly called <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> &amp;c. I would ob&s;erve, as to the fir&s;t Article, that it does not appear to me, but that the <HI>Inauguration</HI> of both was <HI>equally &s;olemn.</HI> What tho' we do not read of our Saviour's <HI>praying</HI> in &s;o &s;olemn a manner be|fore his &s;ending out the 70, as before the Mi&s;&s;ion of the 12, yet that argues little; for there were many things that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> did (as the Evangeli&s;t <HI>John</HI> remarks) which are <HI>not written.</HI> And then having &s;ent our the 70, as our <HI>Author</HI> owns, upon the <HI>&s;ame Errand,</HI> and with the <HI>like Powers,</HI> 'tis <HI>highly probable</HI> the <HI>manner</HI> of their Mi&s;&s;ion was <HI>equally &s;olemn.</HI> But then &s;up|po&s;e there was <HI>no</HI> &s;uch &s;olemn Prayer before the Mi&s;&s;ion of the 70, as we read preceded the Mi&s;&s;ion of the 12, that makes no difference; &s;ince we cannot be <HI>&s;ure</HI> that our Savi|our's <HI>Prayer</HI> on the night before did <HI>immediately</HI> and <HI>peculiarly</HI> refer to <HI>their</HI> Mi&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;ometimes read of our Saviour's making like <HI>&s;olemn Prayer,</HI> when <HI>no</HI> remarka|ble Events followed, nor <HI>any</HI> known extraordinary occa&s;ion was the Ground thereof.</P>
<P>AND now as to his other In&s;tance, that the 12 were par|ticularly honored with the Title of APOSTLES, in Di&s;tinc|tion from the 70, this may po&s;&s;ibly be a mi&s;take; for when we are told, <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.1. <HI>After the&s;e things the Lord appointed</HI> OTHER 70 ALSO <HI>and &s;ent</HI> them out, (with the &s;ame In|&s;tructions and Powers) it may be very well read, <HI>other</HI> 70 <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> altho' it is not &s;o expre&s;&s;ed. And indeed our <HI>Author</HI> is plea&s;ed (in <HI>pag.</HI> 19.) to &s;ay of the 70, that they were CHRIST's <HI>Me&s;&s;engers and Amba&s;&s;adors, &s;o far as their Commi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="18" REF="002594_0021_0FDB7E0977CE50E0">
extended.</HI> Now he over and over confe&s;&s;es their Commi&s;&s;ion was the <HI>&s;ame</HI> with that of the 12; and therefore (according to his own Rule) the honorary Title of <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> belong'd <HI>equally</HI> to them. And here it's worth while to ob&s;erve, That how|ever diminutive he may make the name of <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> to be, 'tis no other than what the <HI>Eleven</HI> were di&s;tingui&s;hed by, when they received their Commi&s;&s;ion. <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.16. They are called, <HI>The Eleven Di&s;ciples.</HI></P>
<P>HE offers <HI>two Arguments</HI> further to &s;how that the 12 &amp; the 70 were two di&s;tinct orders of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That <HI>they are never numbered together, but in two di&s;tinct Cla&s;&s;es</HI>&mdash;.How often (pray) are they numbered &s;o? We don't find the 70, &s;poken of above twice, that is, at their <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and upon their <HI>Return:</HI> and this <HI>&s;eparately</HI> or by <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> the 12 not being mentioned in the Story. We don't any where (that I re+member) find the 12 and the 70. mentioned in the &s;ame-place, and numbered in two di&s;tinct Cla&s;&s;es. And as for the <HI>Apo&s;tles being &s;till called</HI> 12 <HI>and not</HI> 82; that is ea&s;ily accounted for: ina&s;much as the Mi&s;&s;ion of the 70 was a <HI>temporary</HI> and <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> thing; and we never read of any <HI>&s;econd</HI> Mi&s;&s;ion, or further imployment of them, as <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> or <HI>Preachers,</HI> after their <HI>Return</HI> from the Mi&s;&s;ion we have an Account of. Whereas the other 12 were <HI>&s;till</HI> employed on every occa&s;ion, and <HI>gene|rally</HI> were with their Ma&s;ter, as his <HI>&s;pecial Attendants.</HI></P>
<P>AND now for his <HI>&s;econd</HI> Argument, (which he boa&s;ts will put the matter out of all di&s;pute) <HI>What a &s;olemn Work</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>was there, at the tran&s;lation of one from the number of Di&s;ciples, that he might be reckoned with the Eleven, and &s;ucceed to</HI> Judas <HI>his Apo&s;tle&s;hip?</HI> And again, <HI>pa.</HI> 41. he bids us remember, <HI>that the</HI> WHOLE SEVENTY <HI>could not fill up the Chair of</HI> ONE APOSTLE, &amp;c. But there is no weight in this, if we con&s;ider what were the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary qualifications</HI> of an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> viz. an Im|mediate Call, extraordinary Gifts, having been an Eye witne&s;s to the Life, Sufferings and Re&s;urrection of CHRIST, &amp;c. and that CHRIST at his A&s;cen&s;ion left <HI>none other</HI> Mini&s;ters in Commi&s;&s;ion but the <HI>Eleven.</HI> For as to the 70, they were not in Being then, as <HI>Mini&s;ters of the Word;</HI> their Commi&s;&s;ion having <HI>expired</HI> long before, and <HI>not</HI> being <HI>renewed</HI> as was that of the <HI>Eleven.</HI> And then, I &s;uppo&s;e, it is uncertain, whether <HI>Matthias</HI> was of that number, were they &s;till in Commi&s;&s;ion. So that, putting the&s;e things together, it appears, that <HI>Matthias's</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to <HI>Judas</HI> in the Apo&s;tle&s;hip (however &s;olemn Work
<PB N="19" REF="002594_0022_0FDB7E0D283B1E38">
there was about it) affords no manner of Argument for a <HI>Difference of Order</HI> between the 70 and the 12.</P>
<P>AND truely whatever <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> between them may be pretended, &s;ure I am, it could not be <HI>that</HI> which our Author would fain prove between <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters.</HI> For neither the 70, nor yet the 12, had any power given them at their fir&s;t <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> to <HI>ordain Officers,</HI> or to govern the Church; nor indeed could they: for at this time there was no <HI>Go&s;pel Church</HI> to be <HI>governed,</HI> or to have <HI>Officers &s;ettled</HI> in it.</P>
<P>TO this purpo&s;e Mr. <HI>Sage</HI> (a con&s;iderable Writer, of the Church of <HI>England</HI>) &s;aith, <Q>It is mo&s;t obviou&s;ly ob&s;ervable, in the Evangelical Records, that the Chri&s;tian Church was not (could not be) founded, till our Lord was ri&s;en, &s;eeing it was to be founded upon his Re&s;urrection. (He goes on) Our Martyr <HI>Cyprian</HI> (as appears from his Rea&s;onings on diver&s;e occa&s;ions) &s;eems very well to have known, and very di&s;tinctly to have ob&s;erved, that <HI>the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves got not their Commi&s;&s;ion to be Governours of the Chri&s;tian Church, till</HI> after <HI>the Re&s;urrection.</HI> And no wonder, for this their Com|mi&s;&s;ion is mo&s;t ob&s;ervably recorded.</Q> <HI>Joh.</HI> 20.21, &amp;c. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Vindic. of the Princ. of the <HI>Cypr.</HI> age. Ch. 6. Sect. 5. Vid. <HI>Ander&s;</HI> Def pag. 78.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOR doth it appear that the Commi&s;&s;ion of the 70 (<HI>Luk.</HI> 10) was any thing more than <HI>temporary;</HI> for tho' our Author is plea&s;ed to &s;peak of <HI>them</HI> once and again, in &s;uch a manner as &s;eems to intimate, that they are often mentioned in the New Te&s;tament: yet I don't remember, nor can I find that we ever read any thing of them, after their <HI>Return</HI> from this Mi&s;&s;ion; as I hinted before.</P>
<P>AND indeed, I cannot tell whether the <HI>Twelve</HI> would, by virtue of their Commi&s;&s;ion <HI>at this time,</HI> have had any Autho|rity either to <HI>bapti&s;e</HI> or <HI>preach,</HI> after our Lord's A&s;cen&s;ion, if their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> for the&s;e things had not been renewed. For CHRIST him&s;elf thought it needful, to give them a <HI>new Charge</HI> to <HI>teach</HI> &amp; <HI>bapti&s;e,</HI> at the &s;ame time that he committed to them the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>Ordination,</HI> ju&s;t before his A&s;cen&s;ion. To this purpo&s;e Mr. <HI>Sage</HI> adds to what he &s;ays above, <Q>No &s;uch thing is any where recorded of the <HI>Seventy</HI> (as the Renewal of their Commi&s;&s;ion;) nothing more certain than that their Commi&s;&s;ion which is recorded, <HI>Luk.</HI> 10. did con&s;titute them only temporary Mi&s;&s;ionarys and that for an Errand which could not po&s;&s;ibly be more
<PB N="20" REF="002594_0023_0FDB7E0FB1AA6AA0">
than temporary. That Commi&s;&s;ion contains in its own bo&s;om, clear evidences, that it did not in&s;tall them in any &s;tanding Office in the Chri&s;tian Church, <HI>which was not yet in being,</HI> when they got it. Could than Commi&s;&s;ion which is <HI>Luk.</HI> 10. any more con&s;titute the 70 &s;tanding Officers of the Chri&s;tian Church, than the like Commi&s;&s;ion recorded <HI>Math.</HI> 10. cou'd con&s;titute the <HI>Twelve</HI> &s;uch &s;tanding Offi|cers? But it is manife&s;t that this Commi&s;&s;ion did not con&s;titute the <HI>Twelve</HI> Governours of the Chri&s;tian, Church; otherwi&s;e what need of a <HI>new Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> to that purpo&s;e after the Re&s;urrection? Pre&s;umable therefore it is that S. <HI>Cyprian</HI> did not <HI>at all</HI> believe that the 70 had any Succe&s;&s;ors, Office-bearers in the Chri&s;tian Church, &s;eeing it is &s;o ob&s;ervable, that <HI>they them&s;elves</HI> received no Com|mi&s;&s;ion to be &s;uch Office-bearers.</Q> Thus Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></P>
<P>AT lea&s;t thus much is certain, that without <HI>further Powers</HI> given them after our Saviour's Re&s;urrection, the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves mu&s;t never have gone to <HI>the Gentiles.</HI> For in our Lord's Commi&s;&s;ion to them <HI>Matth.</HI> 10, they are expre&s;ly charged <HI>not to go into the way of the Gentiles, but only to the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI> From whence it will follow either that the 70 had a <HI>larger</HI> and <HI>more honorable</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion than the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> had <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> and &s;o were &s;uperior to them; or that the Commi&s;&s;ion of the 70 was but <HI>temporary;</HI> or if it were perpetual, yet that it never was extended by CHRIST <HI>beyond the Circumci&s;ion</HI> I think no <HI>fourth</HI> &s;uppo&s;ition can be made; &s;o that <HI>one</HI> or <HI>other</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>three</HI> mu&s;t be allowed. And which ever our Author thinks fit to grant, it will be the confu&s;ion of his Scheme Be&s;ure he won't be willing to grant the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that the <HI>&s;eventy</HI> had a larger and more honorable Commi&s;&s;ion, and were &s;uperior to the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> And I think no body ever yet &s;uppo&s;ed it. Nor will the <HI>&s;econd</HI> plea&s;e him better; for if the Commi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>&s;eventy</HI> was but <HI>temporary,</HI> and expired upon their return to their Ma&s;ter, then it will follow, that CHRIST left not <HI>two</HI> but <HI>only one Order of Officers</HI> in his Church, at his A&s;cen&s;ion If therefore he &s;hould cho&s;e the <HI>third</HI> &s;up|po&s;al (which at fir&s;t view &s;eems mo&s;t favorable to his cau&s;e) that the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>&s;eventy</HI> did not <HI>expire,</HI> but that it was <HI>confined</HI> to the <HI>Circumci&s;ion,</HI> yet neither will this &s;erve his Turn. For if the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> of the 70 was not extended by CHRIST to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> then we have no concern at all with it, nor did CHRIST leave any other <HI>Officers in Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> at his A&s;cen&s;ion, that had any thing to do with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> be&s;ides
<PB N="21" REF="002594_0024_0FDB7E1106D54480">
his <HI>Eleven Apo&s;tles;</HI> but to <HI>them</HI> he committed the whole Care of <HI>di&s;cipling all Nations, preaching</HI> the <HI>Word, admini&s;tring</HI> the <HI>Sacraments, governing</HI> the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>ordaining</HI> others to <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;ucceed</HI> them in this important Charge; and <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> for their encouragement, to be with <HI>them,</HI> and their <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> in it always, even to the end of the World. Now if CHRIST, at his A&s;cen&s;ion, left <HI>no other Officers in Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> be&s;ides his <HI>Eleven Apo&s;tles,</HI> or <HI>no others in Commi&s;&s;ion that extended unto the Gentiles,</HI> then all that our Author <HI>advances,</HI> under his <HI>fir&s;t head,</HI> concerning the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>&s;eventy</HI> comes to nothing. For whether that <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> was <HI>temporary,</HI> on whether it was <HI>re|&s;trained</HI> to the <HI>lost &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael,</HI> we are alike uncon|cerned with it. And &s;o likewi&s;e all the pains he takes under his <HI>&s;econd head,</HI> to &s;how how the Office of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and the Office of the <HI>&s;eventy,</HI> were di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, will be found to be labour &s;pent to no purpo&s;e. For &s;ince we never read that CHRIST extended the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>&s;eventy</HI> to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> it will thence follow, either that he &s;uffered their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> to expire, or that he left it <HI>confined</HI> to the <HI>Jews:</HI> And take it which way you will, you can find &s;till but <HI>one Order of Officers instituted by CHRIST him&s;elf,</HI> with whom the <HI>Gentile Churches</HI> have any thing to do.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>the mo&s;t</HI> of what the Gentleman &s;ays be&s;ides under his <HI>&s;econd general head,</HI> I have no controver&s;y at all with him. For I readily, acknowledge what he a&s;&s;erts <HI>pa.</HI> 17, That the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> given by our Saviour to the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> after his <HI>Re&s;ur|rection</HI> was <HI>unlimited and univer&s;al, not only in re&s;pect of</HI> power <HI>to di&s;charge all acts of Religion, relating either to</HI> mini&s;try <HI>or</HI> go|vernment; <HI>but al&s;o in re&s;pect of</HI> place, <HI>not being confined to any particular</HI> Province, <HI>but &s;ent to the whole</HI> World.</P>
<P>AND (tho' &s;ome of the In&s;tances he gives, won't bear &s;canning, yet) I firmly believe as he &s;ayes, <HI>pa.</HI> 22, 23. <HI>That it appears the Apo&s;tles had</HI> (&s;ome &s;ort of) <HI>Authority over other Pa&s;tors and Teachers in the Church, from &s;everal In&s;tances of their exerci&s;ing of it, in &s;everal re&s;pects and ways, recorded in the &s;acred Hi&s;tory.</HI> And I will venture to &s;ay further, that during the <HI>Infant-State</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Church, before the Canon of the <HI>New-Te&s;tament</HI> was compleated, (without which the unin&s;pired <HI>man of GOD</HI> could not be <HI>thoroughly furni&s;hed unto every good work</HI>) it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;ome kind of <HI>Juri&s;diction,</HI> over the <HI>unin&s;pired Pa&s;tors</HI> of the Churches, &s;hould be committed to &s;uch men as the <HI>Apostles,</HI> who being under the immediate Conduct of an <HI>infallible Spirit,</HI> might be able as often as occa|&s;ion
<PB N="22" REF="002594_0025_0FDB7E129CF9E090">
required, with all <HI>Authority</HI> to <HI>charge</HI> &amp; <HI>direct</HI> the other <HI>Pa&s;tors how to behave them&s;elves in the hou&s;e of GOD.</HI> A notable In&s;tance we have of this, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.14, 15. where notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;ingular advantages <HI>Timothy</HI> had had to inform him&s;elf about the <HI>Work of an Evangelist,</HI> by his intimate acquaintance with the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> and frequent attendance upon him; yet the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> is afraid, that if he &s;hould be hindered from coming to him as &s;oon as he de&s;ired, <HI>Timothy</HI> might be at a lo&s;s how to di&s;charge the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him; and therefore he writes unto him the &s;olemn Charges, Exhortations and In|&s;tructions of that Epi&s;tle, that <HI>he might know how he ought to behave him&s;elf in the Church of the living GOD.</HI> And not &s;atis|fyed with this, he followed it with a <HI>&s;econd Epi&s;tle</HI> on the &s;ame De&s;ign afterwards.</P>
<P>NOW, if it be evident that the Apo&s;tles had &s;ome &s;ort of Juri&s;diction over other Pa&s;tors; and if it be al&s;o evident that there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>at that day,</HI> that &s;ome &s;uch men as they &s;hould have &s;uch Juri&s;diction; it may very na|turally be inquired, <HI>Whether there is the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity &s;ince, that &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel &s;hould have a like Authority over others throughout all Ages?</HI> And, <HI>Whether the Scriptures teach us that this is the Will of GOD?</HI></P>
<P>AS to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Inquiries;</HI> it is very obvious on two Accounts, <HI>That the &s;ame Rea&s;on does not hold in the nature of the thing it &s;elf, for a &s;uperior power in &s;ome Mini&s;ters over others now.</HI> For <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> there are no Officers in the Church in the&s;e later Ages, under the Conduct of an <HI>Infallible Spirit,</HI> to i&s;&s;ue out di|rections and commands to others on emergent occa&s;ions. Nor indeed is there any body on this &s;ide <HI>Rome</HI> that pretends to it. Now it's thought by &s;ome of great name and judgment, That the higher Degree of Authority &amp; Sway, which the Apo&s;tles had above others, was owing very much to their extraordi|nary Gifts of Infallibility, of di&s;cerning Spirits, and the like, which were peculiar to them. And indeed there's the greate&s;t difficulty (as Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> ob&s;erves) to di&s;cern how much of their power over Presbyters or Bi&s;hops was <HI>merely</HI> from the Excellency of their Gifts and Privileges, and how much might be (if any was) from their Supremacy of Office and Imperial Authority. Nor, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> is there the &s;ame <HI>Need</HI> that there &s;hould be any &s;uch <HI>infallible Rulers</HI> in the Church now, that there was in the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> dayes; becau&s;e the <HI>Canon of Scripture</HI> being now completed, every Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel hath
<PB N="23" REF="002594_0026_0FDB7E140BF2BF10">
an infallible and perfect Rule to direct him in his Admini&s;tra|tions. To this purpo&s;e our <HI>Author (pag.</HI> 33, 34) acknowlegeth, as that <HI>the Go&s;pel-Doctrine being once &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted &amp; con|firmed by miraculous operations, there was no further need of continuing them; So, that &s;ome Things peculiar to the Apostles, &s;uch as, their being</HI> infallible Guides in delivering the Doctrine of the Go&s;pel, their unlimited Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c. had a particular Re&s;pect to the</HI> fir&s;t planting <HI>of the Go&s;pel, and the erecting and constituting of the Chri&s;tian Church in the World: which when performed, the&s;e extraor|dinary Powers cea&s;ed.</HI>&mdash;Since therefore the &s;ame Rea&s;ons don't hold good <HI>now</HI> for a &s;uperiority of &s;ome Mini&s;ters over others, we have no ground to believe that &s;uch a &s;uperiority ought to continue &s;till, <HI>unle&s;s the Scriptures teach us notwith&s;tanding, that it is the Will of GOD that this &s;uperiority &s;hould be standing and perpetual in the Church.</HI> And this is what our <HI>Author</HI> en|deavours to prove under his third Head.</P>
<P>BUT before the Examination of his Argument here, I mu&s;t premi&s;e, that he and I are agreed, that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were in|ve&s;ted with <HI>&s;ome Powers that were extraordinary &amp; temporary, and expired with their Per&s;ons;</HI> and that therefore in <HI>the&s;e</HI> they could have no Succe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Again, WE are agreed, that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were inve&s;ted with other <HI>powers that were ordinary &amp; de&s;igned to be perpetual,</HI> in which they were to have <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors,</HI> who &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s them through|out all Ages. And with an eye to their <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> it was that their Lord <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> to <HI>be with them always to the end of the World.</HI></P>
<P>NOW &s;ince we are both agreed in the&s;e two things, (and have (I think) the concurrence of all the World both <HI>Con|formists</HI> &amp; <HI>Non-conformi&s;ts</HI> with us in them,) the only thing that remains to be di&s;puted is, Whether <HI>that Juri&s;diction</HI> which was exerci&s;ed by the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> over <HI>other Pa&s;tors,</HI> was <HI>one of their</HI> ORDINARY POWERS, <HI>in which they were to have</HI> SUC|CESSORS? Or, <HI>Whether it was a power only</HI> EXTRORDI|NARY <HI>and</HI> TEMPORARY, <HI>in which they were to have no Succe&s;&s;ors, and to expire with their Per&s;ons?</HI></P>
<P>NOW here the force of truth hath con&s;trained our <HI>Author</HI> to make an acknowledgement, which is in effect at once to give up his whole cau&s;e. For he him&s;elf in his 33d <HI>page,</HI> reckons <HI>the Juri&s;diction the Apo&s;tles had over all Churches</HI> (and by con&s;equence over the Pa&s;tors of them al&s;o) among <HI>tho&s;e Powers that were extraordinary &amp; temporary, and expired with their Per&s;ons:</HI> By doing which, he hath (I &s;ay) in effect at once
<PB N="24" REF="002594_0027_0FDB7E1577F2D870">
given up his whole cau&s;e; for hereby he hath cut him&s;elf off from all po&s;&s;ibility of proving, by the In&s;tances he gives, <HI>any ordinary power of Juri&s;diction in the Apo&s;tles over other Pa&s;tors.</HI> For &s;uppo&s;ing he had given ten thou&s;and In&s;tances, in which the <HI>Apostles</HI> exerci&s;ed an <HI>Authority</HI> over other <HI>Pa&s;tors&punc;</HI> yet all the&s;e might be, for ought he or any man el&s;e can tell, not by virtue of any <HI>ordinary power,</HI> they were intru&s;ted with, in which they were to have &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; but only by virtue of <HI>that extraordinary Power in which they were to have no Succe&s;&s;ors,</HI> by which he acknowleges it was, that <HI>they had a Juri&s;diction over all other Churches.</HI> So that here I might very fairly with|draw my hand from the Table; for the Gentleman hath him|&s;elf put it out of his own power to prove any thing by the Argument he makes u&s;e of. And yet I &s;uppo&s;e it was not <HI>want of thought</HI> but <HI>force of truth,</HI> and <HI>unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> that drew him into this Acknowlegement &s;o fatal to his own Ar|gument. For any man that will be at the pains to examin the In&s;tances he hath given of the <HI>Apostles Authority</HI> over other Pa&s;tors, and will then carefully look over the Epi&s;tles to the <HI>Corinthians, Philippians, Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> (to mention no more) will pre&s;ently find many In&s;tances ju&s;t like the mo&s;t of tho&s;e given by our Author, (nay &s;ome of <HI>his</HI> may be taken into the number al&s;o) in which the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> exerci&s;ed an <HI>Authority</HI> over <HI>Timothy, Titus, Epaphroditus,</HI> and others, whom <HI>Epi&s;copal Divines</HI> account <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI> Now this ob&s;ervation being &s;o very ea&s;y, forced our Author upon this unhappy <HI>Dilemma,</HI> either to affirm that the Apo&s;tle exerci&s;ed an <HI>Authority</HI> over &s;uch as <HI>Epi&s;copal Divines</HI> account <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> by virtue of his <HI>ordinary Power</HI> [for no man is able to give me any tolerable Rea&s;on, why his Government over <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> &s;hould be grounded on an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Power, and yet his Government over <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> be by virtue of his ordinary Power] <HI>that was to be perpetuated in the Church;</HI> which would be to &s;et up <HI>an ordinary Officer in the Church by divine Institution &s;uperior to Bi&s;hops;</HI> a thing contrary to the declared &s;en&s;e of our Author and his Brethren: or el&s;e, to avoid the ill con&s;equence of this, he mu&s;t &s;ay, that this <HI>Au|thority of the Apo&s;tles over all Churches &amp; Pa&s;tors was one of their Extraordinary Powers;</HI> which &s;ort of powers he el&s;ewhere ac|knowledges <HI>expired with their per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>that they had no &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors in them.</HI> And this latter inconvenience he hath thought fit to choo&s;e, though it be no le&s;s de&s;tructive to his own Ar|gument, than the former, as I have &s;hown above.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="002594_0028_0FDB7E1946647980">I have now &s;aid enough (I &s;uppo&s;e) to &s;atisfy every in|telligent unprejudiced Per&s;on of the weakne&s;s and Incon&s;i&s;t|ency of our <HI>Author</HI>'s Proofs of his own Scheme.

<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 35. he &s;ays, <HI>That no part of the Apo&s;tolick Office is more nece&s;&s;ary to be of perpetual duration in the Church, than their authoritative In|&s;pection over the ordinary Pa&s;tors.</HI> That he hath as yet proved no nece&s;&s;ity of this from the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> hath been I &s;uppo&s;e con|vincingly &s;hown. And that there is no nece&s;&s;ity of it <HI>in the nature of the thing it &s;elf</HI> (to omit what hath been &s;aid already) any man may &s;atisfy him&s;elf, if he will but impartially inquire, whether the <HI>Ends of Government</HI> are not as well an&s;wered, the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Religion</HI> as effectually promoted, and the <HI>Church</HI> as well guarded again&s;t Errors, Schi&s;ms and Corruptions, in tho&s;e <HI>Countries,</HI> which acknowlege no <HI>Superiority</HI> in Pa&s;tors one over another, as in tho&s;e <HI>two Kingdoms,</HI> that are the only <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> ones, in which &s;uch a Superiority is held to be of Divine In&s;titution?</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Author</HI> now attempts to produce &s;ome <HI>further</HI> Proofs of his Scheme from the holy-Scriptures. Several Texts he brings to prove that the <HI>Apostolic Office</HI> (he mu&s;t here e&s;peci|ally point at the power of <HI>univer&s;al In&s;pection</HI> over Churches and Pa&s;tors, or el&s;e he &s;ays nothing to the purpo&s;e) <HI>was not extraordinary and temporary,</HI> but de&s;ign'd to be &s;tanding and perpetual.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, He draws an Argument from the <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;ion</HI> in <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19, 20. Where <HI>CHRIST enjoyns the Apo&s;tles to teach all Nations, whom they &s;hould di&s;ciple, to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever he had commanded them,</HI> and <HI>gives them a Promi&s;e to be with them to the end of the World.</HI> This he calls their <HI>full</HI> &amp; <HI>la&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion:</HI> by this therefore they mu&s;t &s;tand or fall, and the Gentleman mu&s;t de&s;pair of his Cau&s;e, if this will not &s;up|port it.</P>
<P>NOW there's nothing contained in this, but what is the work of <HI>ordinary Mini&s;ters</HI> or <HI>Pa&s;tors.</HI> Teaching and baptizing, which are the undoubted work of Presbyters, are here <HI>ex|pre&s;ly</HI> mention'd: but indeed we mu&s;t interpret this Text, in the utmo&s;t Latitude, &s;o as to take in all mini&s;terial Powers, of Ordination, Di&s;cipline, and Government, as being nece&s;|&s;arily imply'd. Here's the grand <HI>Charter</HI> for our Office, and all the Power that any can ju&s;tly claim, mu&s;t be here included.
<PB N="26" REF="002594_0029_0FDB7E1B745650C0">
And the <HI>whole</HI> of the Power here imply'd, belongs to all tho&s;e, unto whom the Commi&s;&s;ion extends. Now it was given (our Author owns) not merely to the Apo&s;tles, but al&s;o to their <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors:</HI> and &s;o the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> annexed, is to their <HI>Office,</HI> not to their <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> only. And the <HI>Office</HI> they were authoriz'd to, by this Commi&s;&s;ion, was not to expire with them, but to <HI>continue</HI> unto the <HI>end of the world.</HI></P>
<P>WE mu&s;t note, The <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> may be con&s;idered under a <HI>double</HI> notion, as having either <HI>ordinary</HI> or <HI>extraordinary</HI> Powers. This Commi&s;&s;ion was given them, in one or other, or both, of the&s;e Capacities. So far as it cou'd relate to them in their <HI>extraordinary</HI> Capacity, it mu&s;t be only <HI>Per&s;onal,</HI> and a Patent for Life, expiring with them&s;elves; or at mo&s;t continuing only through the Age of In&s;piration and Miracles. But &s;o far as it related to them in their <HI>ordinary</HI> Character, it was de&s;ign'd to be <HI>perpetual,</HI> and the Promi&s;e belongs to their Succe&s;&s;ors in common with them.&mdash;That it relates to them under the <HI>latter</HI> Con&s;ideration more e&s;pecially, is evident from the Tenor of the Commi&s;&s;ion, which pre&s;cribes only Work that is ordinary; and from the Tenor of the Promi&s;e, which looks to all future Ages, and therefore &s;uppo&s;es their perpetual Duration. But in the&s;e things the Author and I are agreed.</P>
<P>ALL the <HI>Di&s;pute</HI> here is, Who are the true <HI>Succe&s;&s;or,</HI> of the Apo&s;tles; and &s;o, who may lay Claim to this Divine Com|mi&s;&s;ion and Promi&s;e? Now there are two things which may &s;uffice to decide the Ca&s;e: <HI>viz.</HI> The nature of the <HI>Work</HI> laid out in the Commi&s;&s;ion, and the <HI>Character</HI> of the Apo&s;tles in their <HI>ordinary</HI> Capacity. And by both of the&s;e Rules (I pre&s;ume) it mu&s;t be concluded that <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>ordinary Pa&s;tors</HI> are the Apo&s;tles <HI>true Succe&s;&s;ors.</HI> For the <HI>Work</HI> here a&s;&s;ign'd is what (as I before ob&s;erv'd) properly belongs to <HI>Them;</HI> who have ever therefore repair'd to this Commi&s;&s;ion, to vindicate them|&s;elves, in the mini&s;terial Acts of <HI>preaching, bapti&s;ing,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;And then if we con&s;ider the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their <HI>ordinary Capacity,</HI> it will appear they were mo&s;t properly <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or <HI>Mini&s;ters of the Word,</HI> and could be <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> only in the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Sen&s;e Be &s;ure they were not Bi&s;hops after the <HI>Engli&s;h Form,</HI> nor in|tended &s;o to be: for according to this, our Lord mu&s;t have a&s;&s;ign'd to each of the Apo&s;tles his <HI>di&s;tinct Province,</HI> his parti|cular Po&s;t, or Charge, to act and rule in, with a mutual In|dependency; &s;eeing they are the approved Principles of that Model, <HI>That all Bi&s;hops are</HI> equal, <HI>and have no Eminency of Power one above another:</HI> So likewi&s;e <HI>that every Church mu&s;t have its

particular Bi&s;hop, and that there can be in a Church but</HI> one <HI>Prelate at a time.</HI> Whereas if we reflect, we &s;hall find, that a <HI>Plorality</HI> (even no le&s;s than 11 or 12) pre&s;ided together over the Church in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> at the beginning; and that the Apo&s;tles tarry'd there a <HI>con&s;iderable Time,</HI> (as the &s;acred Story a&s;&s;ures us, and if &s;ome ancient Church-Hi&s;tories may be credited, it was no le&s;s than the &s;pace of &s;everal <HI>Years) taking Care of that Church</HI> (which called for peculiar Regards from them) in it's <HI>Infant</HI> State: at lea&s;t it may be believed they ordinarily re&s;ided in and about <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> for a while; perhaps only when there was uncommon occa&s;ion, i&s;&s;uing out upon particular Mi&s;&s;ions, and then returning to <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> as &s;eems very probable from the In&s;tance we have, <HI>Acts</HI> 8.14 &mdash; 25 And now in ma|naging the <HI>Affairs</HI> of <HI>that Church,</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> acted, either with an equal or an unequal Authority. And take it which way you plea&s;e, they could not be <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> after the Dioce&s;an notion. For if they all acted with an <HI>equal</HI> Authority; then they could not be <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> for this very <HI>pertinent</HI> Rea&s;on, becau&s;e there can be but <HI>one</HI> Bi&s;hop in a Church Neither again cou'd they be Bi&s;hops, &s;uppo&s;e 'em to have an <HI>unequal</HI> Autho|rity, becau&s;e <HI>all</HI> Bi&s;hops are <HI>equal,</HI> and none &s;ubordinate to others. Now they mu&s;t be either Bi&s;hops or Presbyters. And &s;ince they were not the <HI>former,</HI> What mu&s;t we conclude?</P>
<P>SO then it appears by the Character they mu&s;t bear, while ru|ling in the Church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that the Apo&s;tles were <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in their ordinary Capacity&mdash;In the Root &amp; Principle, they were only <HI>Presbyters:</HI> the other parts of their Character were only additional, or occa&s;ional and circum&s;tantial. Our <HI>Author</HI> him&s;elf makes no Exception here, &s;ave as to their power of <HI>Superintendency,</HI> which he makes to be one of the <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> and <HI>perpetual</HI> or ordinary Powers of an Apo&s;tle: but &s;ince he hath not as yet been able to prove this, we may &s;afely adhere to our Opinion, That the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> con&s;ider'd in their ordinary Capacity, were but <HI>Presbyters:</HI> and &s;o con&s;equently all that truly &s;u&s;tain the Character of <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Go&s;pel-Ministers,</HI> are the Apo&s;tles <HI>true Succe&s;&s;ors;</HI> and hence, by an ea&s;y Inference, appear entitul'd to the Commi&s;&s;ion and the Promi&s;e given of old to the Eleven Di&s;ciples, by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord.</P>
<P>Briefly; WE may &s;et the matter in this Light: Either this Commi&s;&s;ion <HI>does</HI> belong to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or it does <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="002594_0031_0FDB7E1EB74AC518">IF you a&s;&s;ume in the <HI>Negative,</HI> or &s;ay, it does <HI>not:</HI> then it can't ea&s;ily be made out, that <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> have <HI>any Divine Mi&s;&s;ion at all,</HI> or any Warrant to mini&s;ter in holy things. I have be|fore prov'd there is but <HI>one</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion for the <HI>&s;acred Mini&s;ter,</HI> &s;tanding or in force; which is that &s;ame we are &s;peaking of&punc; and that CHRIST at his A&s;cen&s;ion left no other Officers in power, but his Eleven Apo&s;tles. Hence then &s;uch as have no Intere&s;t in this Commi&s;&s;ion, can have no Claim to any part of the Office in&s;tituted therein, nor may pretend to <HI>Preach</HI> any more than to exerci&s;e the powers of Di&s;cipline and Orders.</P>
<P>BUT if you a&s;&s;ume in the <HI>Affirmative,</HI> and &s;ay that Presby|ters <HI>are</HI> concern'd in this Commi&s;&s;ion; then I inquire, <HI>How far?</HI> Do's it belong to them in <HI>whole,</HI> or in <HI>part?</HI></P>
<P>IF you &s;ay in the <HI>whole;</HI> then it follows there can be no <HI>ordinary</HI> eccle&s;ia&s;tical Officer &s;uperior to <HI>Presbyters:</HI> &s;ince they are inve&s;ted with the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion in the Church, and with the <HI>one only</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion for the Mini&s;try. The preten|ded <HI>Prelates</HI> can act only by virtue of this Commi&s;&s;ion, and they that act by one and the &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t certainly have equal and the &s;ame Powers Different Powers, or various Degrees of Power, mu&s;t be founded in di&s;tinct Commi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>IF any &s;ay, in <HI>part</HI> only; then I inquire in what parts and degrees, and who are &s;harers with them? Our <HI>Author</HI> re&s;olves the Que&s;tion, by giving <HI>Presbyters</HI> the power of <HI>Doc|trine,</HI> and putting into the hands of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> the powers of <HI>Or|dination</HI> &amp; <HI>Juri&s;diction.</HI> But then I demand a Rule for dividing what GOD has united, and di&s;tributing the &s;everal parts of this Office into different Hands. Why &s;hould not <HI>Presbyters</HI> (if they &s;ucceed to the Apo&s;tles, in any proper &s;en&s;e or degree) have one part of their mini&s;terial Power as well as another? What is the Rea&s;on or Ground for any Di&s;crimination in the matter? Nay, Is it not contrary to the very nature of a proper Succe&s;&s;ion, that two di&s;tinct Officers &s;hou'd &s;hare the <HI>mini&s;terial Powers</HI> of the Apo&s;tles between them, and that in <HI>unequal Degrees</HI> too? <HI>Divi&s;ion</HI> here makes an <HI>e&s;&s;ential Alteration.</HI> Whatever Office is made up out of &s;ome other Office, and partakes only of a part of the e&s;&s;ential Powers belonging to it, mu&s;t needs be different from it, and mu&s;t be call'd a <HI>new</HI> Office. And this is the very Ca&s;e we have before us. The <HI>Presbyter</HI> (&s;tript of any of the <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> &amp; <HI>ordinary Powers</HI> of the Apo&s;to|lic Office) is a Creature of <HI>another</HI> Order, and quite a <HI>new Species;</HI> as much as the <HI>Deacon</HI> was tho' the Former has not (as
<PB N="29" REF="002594_0032_0FDB7E2421F47588">
the Latter hath) any <HI>Divine In&s;titution</HI> to &s;upport and counte|nance him, and therefore is to be rejected as an <HI>Un&s;criptural Officer,</HI> having no proper Title to the Commi&s;&s;ion and Promi&s;e made to the Apo&s;tles; however he may pretend to be deriva|tive from them.</P>
<P>INDEED, Suppo&s;ing our ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Lord</HI> had in&s;tituted the &s;everal powers which the Apo&s;tles had, as 'twere by <HI>halves,</HI> (the power of <HI>Government</HI> &s;eparately, and the power of <HI>Doctrine</HI> by it &s;elf) in di&s;tinct Commi&s;&s;ions, both whereof were to be &s;tanding; then we might perhaps have rea&s;onably argu'd tho&s;e Powers capable of exi&s;ting &s;eparately in di&s;tinct Subjects: and at this Door, the mere <HI>preaching Presbyter</HI> might come in, and be look'd upon as a <HI>regular Officer;</HI> and not <HI>&s;imply</HI> new, altho' he had differ'd from his Predece&s;&s;ors, the Apo&s;tles; looking at their Office <HI>in Complexo,</HI> &amp; taking their Powers all together. Or again, Suppo&s;ing the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> (in the name of their a&s;cended Lord) had in&s;tituted this new Officer, the mere <HI>preaching Presbyter,</HI> (a&s;&s;igning him out of their Office, only the power of <HI>Doctrine;</HI> as they appointed a di&s;tinct Office of <HI>Deacons,</HI> devolving on them the Mini&s;try of <HI>Tables</HI> only) there would (in this ca&s;e too) have been &s;ufficient Founda|tion for the &s;imple <HI>Presbyter</HI> or <HI>Preacher,</HI> and we might have lookt upon his Credentials as very authentic.</P>
<P>BUT now I cannot learn that this mere <HI>preaching Presbyter</HI> has any manner of Warrant, upon either of the&s;e Hypothe&s;es.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort then, If there be any &s;uch Officer of CHRIST, as a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> or <HI>Minister of the Word,</HI> he mu&s;t &s;tand upon that (&s;ingle) Commi&s;&s;ion given the Apo&s;tles at the A&s;cen&s;ion of CHRIST; and &s;o by good Con&s;equence mu&s;t &s;ucceed them in all the ordinary and continuing parts of their Office. I ask then, By what Rule do any di&s;tingui&s;h the Power of <HI>Doctrine</HI> and the Power of <HI>Government</HI> from one another, and deny the latter to the Order of <HI>Presbyters?</HI>&mdash;To bring this matter to a point, I wou'd argue thus. The power of <HI>Government</HI> be|long'd to the Apo&s;tles either in their <HI>ordinary</HI> or <HI>extraordinary</HI> Capacity. If only in their <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> then no Body a|mong their Succe&s;&s;ors has any ju&s;t Pretences to it. If in their <HI>Ordinary,</HI> then they who &s;ucceed them in the power of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> are the Order, to whom alone that <HI>other</HI> Power al&s;o of Right belongs: &s;ince they who are in any degree properly Succe&s;&s;ors to the Apo&s;tles, mu&s;t &s;ucceed them in the whole of their &s;tanding Character, as I have proved before. <HI>Moreover,</HI> I would add here, the Key of Di&s;cipline and Rule mu&s;t needs

belong to &s;uch as have the Key of Doctrine, for this very &s;ignificant Rea&s;on, Becau&s;e the <HI>Latter</HI> is the <HI>greater Honour,</HI> and more worthy Badge, of the Two; I don't &s;ay in mine and my Brethren's Opinion, but in the Judgment of no le&s;s a Per&s;on than the in&s;pired <HI>Apostle,</HI> as you may &s;ee, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. Now why &s;hou'd the <HI>le&s;s</HI> honorable Power be denied them? Here then I demand again, What <HI>Warrant</HI> (or Colour of Rea|&s;on) have any to deny <HI>Presbyters</HI> the Power of <HI>Government?</HI> Where is the <HI>Scripture</HI> that runs a Line of Di&s;tinction between <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byters?</HI> Where &s;hall we in all our Bible find the place, that a&s;&s;igns different Succe&s;&s;ors to the Apo&s;tles, and di&s;per&s;eth the mini&s;terial Powers, united in them; committing to one this, and to another that, as di&s;tinct Officers in the Church?</P>
<P>BUT now before I pa&s;s to our <HI>Authors</HI> other Proofs, I think it proper here a little to anticipate him, and be&s;tow a Reflection or two, upon one declamatory and very har&s;h Pa&s;|&s;age of his, referring to this matter; which we have, in <HI>pag.</HI> 44. <HI>Either</HI> (quoth he) <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> (Dioce&s;an, that is) <HI>mu&s;t be</HI> THE TRUE <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles, or el&s;e they have no Succe&s;|&s;ors</HI> AT ALL, <HI>and the Apo&s;tolic Order &amp; Office is</HI> QUITE <HI>ex|tinct; and the Church is</HI> TOTALLY <HI>deprived of the prime and chiefe&s;t Office in&s;tituted by CHRIST for its Edification, good Or|der, and Government; and finally, There is now no &s;uch Order of Men extant in the World, to whom that</HI> LARGE <HI>and</HI> AMPLE <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion which CHRIST gave only to his</HI> APOSTLES, <HI>does belong: and with this, the Promi&s;e falls too.</HI>&mdash;Who now can for|bear admiring the <HI>Zeal</HI> of this Gentleman, and his wonderful <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> here! But &s;uffer me to expo&s;tulate a little with him upon it.&mdash;What! Is there no <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> way for the <HI>Apo&s;tolic Order</HI> to continue, but in the Per&s;ons of Dioce&s;an <HI>Bi&s;hops!</HI> Mu&s;t the Apo&s;tles be deny'd any <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors at all,</HI> if his idoliz'd <HI>Prelacy</HI> be deny'd!

And how can he &s;ay, The Church is <HI>totally</HI> depriv'd of the chief Office in&s;tituted by CHRIST for its Edification, &s;o long as we have the benefit of the <HI>Apo&s;tolic Writings,</HI> by which <HI>(being dead) they yet &s;peak.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="002594_0034_0FDB7E2700883330">AND finally, Does he complain, That except <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> be allow'd to &s;ucceed the Apo&s;tles, <HI>There is now no &s;uch Order of Men extant in the World, to whom that</HI> LARGE <HI>&amp;</HI> AMPLE <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion, which CHRIST gave</HI> ONLY <HI>to his Apo&s;tles, does belong!</HI> What means the Gentleman by this?</P>
<P>IF he wou'd bear the world in hand, that the Commi&s;&s;ion, which the Apo&s;tles receiv'd, was given to them <HI>only,</HI> and in di&s;tinction from <HI>Presbyters;</HI> this is as <HI>gratis dictum;</HI> a Point that needs proof, after all that he hath &s;aid upon it.</P>

<PB N="32" REF="002594_0035_0FDB7E284754A5E0">
So <HI>Saravia</HI> (a prime Leader in the notion of the Divine Right of Prelacy) profe&s;&s;eth, <Q>We mea&s;ure not a <HI>Bi&s;hoprick</HI> by the number of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> or by the amplitude of the <HI>Dioce&s;s;</HI> for the <HI>Bi&s;hoprick</HI> may be included in <HI>one &s;mall Pari&s;h alone</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Jame&s;.

<P>HENCE then, according to the&s;e Principles, <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> and <HI>Presbyterian Parity</HI> are very well reconcilable: for I know no difference between a Congregational <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> and an Inde|pendent <HI>Pa&s;tor;</HI> &s;ave that the latter may want the <HI>Epi&s;copal Con&s;ecration,</HI> which they &s;peak of, and make nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>Authority of the Epi&s;copal Degree.</HI> But &s;urely <HI>that</HI> can afford no plea for the Di&s;tinction between Bi&s;hops and Presbyters; becau&s;e there's no &s;olid proof of any Rule in the <HI>&s;acred Scrip|tures,</HI> for this Con&s;ecration of Bi&s;hops, as different from the Ordination of Presbyters. I will boldly affirm, They may turn over all the Leaves of their Bible, as long as they have Eyes to &s;ee, and not be able to produce a Scripture-Canon for any thing more than <HI>Mini&s;terial</HI> Ordination. Nay in the, Very <HI>Directory</HI> for Ordination, (<HI>Tit.</HI> 1.) the Apo&s;tle makes no Di&s;tinction in the lea&s;t between <HI>Presbyters</HI> &amp; <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> but rather makes them the very <HI>&s;ame,</HI> as I &s;hall &s;how by'n'by.&mdash; However we will not quarrel and part <HI>here:</HI> Nay, and more|over I will for once grant them, That <HI>Bi&s;hops are the true Suc|ce&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles; deriving from them the power of Ordination &amp; Juri&s;diction;</HI> this, I &s;ay I will grant them, if they will but hold to tho&s;e two Principles, (which we find them &s;ometimes allowing us,) <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>every Congregation may have its own partieular Bi&s;hop; and then that all Bi&s;hops are upon the Level, having equal &amp; independent Authority.</HI></P>
<P>YEA, If they'll allow the&s;e two things, I will grant them further, That the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> annexed to the Apo&s;tles Com|mi&s;&s;ion, <HI>does belong to Bi&s;hops;</HI> and &s;o the <HI>horrid con&s;equences</HI> we may hope will be prevented, which our <HI>Author</HI> conceives would follow, if Bi&s;hops be not the true Succe&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="002594_0036_0FDB7E29C830AE00">THUS at la&s;t, I think, we are led into a way, to per+petuate <HI>the prime Office in&s;tituted by CHRIST for the Church Edification, good Order &amp; Government,</HI> and to &s;ecure the great <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> made to the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Order,</HI> by a regular Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> too: and yet con&s;i&s;tent enough with the <HI>Presbyterial</HI> Model.</P>
<P>AND &s;o it appears, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Text, that our <HI>Author</HI> brings to &s;upport the prelatical &s;cheme, proves of no &s;ub&s;erviency at all to his purpo&s;e, but much the contrary.</P>
<P>I have been drawn to a greater length in the con&s;ideration of this Text, becau&s;e I perceive the <HI>Gentleman</HI> lays pecu|liar Stre&s;s upon it; referring us frequently and with great a&s;&s;urance to the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> there: and becau&s;e I think as to this he is in the Right; for I believe, we have <HI>here</HI> (to u&s;e &s;ome of <HI>his</HI> words) <HI>the Hinge, on which the whole Contro|ver&s;y in this matter depends</HI> And verily, if <HI>Presbyters</HI> are ab&s;olutely &s;hut out of <HI>this</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall de&s;pair of finding any other E&s;tabli&s;hment for them, in the whole Bible. Or if <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> have by virtue of this Commi&s;&s;ion a Right of Juri&s;|diction over Presbyters, or any Power but what <HI>Presbyters</HI> have as well as they a Title to, this wou'd decide the Ca&s;e with me: and I &s;hou'd think it almo&s;t needle&s;s to take the pains to examin any <HI>other</HI> Scripture-Proofs he has to bring. But being, after the mo&s;t impartial &s;earch into the matter, &s;trongly convinced of the <HI>contrary,</HI> I &s;hall proceed to the other Texts he brings, and &s;ee whether they can afford any <HI>new Light</HI> to the Argument.</P>
<P>THO' I wou'd premi&s;e here one Thing, as a <HI>Principle,</HI> not to be di&s;puted; <HI>viz.</HI> That this <HI>fir&s;t Text,</HI> as containing the <HI>Go&s;pel-Charter</HI> or Commi&s;&s;ion for the Mini&s;try, mu&s;t therefore be admitted the grand <HI>RULE</HI> to us in interpreting other Texts, relating to the <HI>Controver&s;y.</HI> All mu&s;t be reduced to <HI>this</HI> Standard; and no Con&s;truction of any Scripture be al|low'd, that makes it <HI>militate</HI> with this fir&s;t and grand Text. We mu&s;t note; All <HI>Corporations</HI> are to model their Go|vernment by their <HI>Charter,</HI> and by the In&s;tructions of their original Founder: no Laws are to be enacted <HI>repugnant</HI> to the&s;e; and all Laws already made, are to be <HI>interpreted</HI> in a &s;en&s;e plainly <HI>con&s;istent</HI> therewith&mdash;. As then we may ju&s;tly reject any Decrees or Ordinances of <HI>Men,</HI> that pretend to alter, limit, or add to the &s;tanding Powers of the Divine Commi&s;&s;ion afore&s;aid: So we may rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pect that <HI>Expo&s;ition</HI> of any
<PB N="34" REF="002594_0037_0FDB7E2C08347AA8">
<HI>Text,</HI> which makes it to <HI>interfere</HI> with this. And hence, tho' &s;ome particular Texts cou'd be produced, that might by a witty Turn be made to look favourably towards the <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> between Bi&s;hops and Presbyters: yet if this Di&s;tinction cannot con&s;i&s;t with the Royal CHARTER, or cannot be deduced from it by any rational Inferences, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily look out for &s;ome other &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e Texts, and reject the for|mer Con&s;truction as certainly erroneous.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add here what one well ob&s;erves; This being <Q>a Que&s;tion concerning a very great Power, extending to a great Number of Per&s;ons, and producing great Effects, a matter of great Di&s;tinction, and Dependencies, ought to have clear and po&s;itive Warrant from the Word of GOD, and be very plainly legible in the Commi&s;&s;ion there. Meer <HI>Names, Titles, Suppo&s;itions,</HI> and fine <HI>Probabilities,</HI> will not all make a Foundation &s;trong enough, to bear the weight of a &s;tructure &s;o high and towering, as our Engli&s;h Prelacy.</Q></P>
<P>WELL, we will now examin our <HI>Author</HI>'s other Scripture-Proofs, and &s;ee what weight they will bear to have laid upon them.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>&s;econd</HI> Text is, 1 Cor. 12.28. <HI>Where the Apo&s;tle</HI> Paul <HI>tells us, GOD hath &s;et &s;ome in the Church, fir&s;t</HI> APOSTLES, <HI>&s;econdly</HI> PROPHETS, <HI>thirdly</HI> TEACHERS.&mdash; Here, by the way he in&s;erts in a Parenthe&s;is this ob&s;ervation, That <HI>what follow, are not di&s;tinct Offices from the&s;e, but extraordinary Gifts conferred upon them.</HI> But I believe his Ob&s;ervation will not hold good, as to all the Articles in the following Enumera|tion; For what will he make of the <HI>Helps</HI> and <HI>Governments,</HI> mention'd there? Do not the&s;e mean <HI>di&s;tinct Officers?</HI> I am &s;ure many learned Interpreters judge &s;o: and among others, &s;ome of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Particularly, Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> (from Dr. <HI>Lightfoot</HI>) &s;ays on the place, That the <HI>Helps</HI> here were <HI>Deacons,</HI> or &s;uch Officers as took Care of the Poor: and by <HI>Governments,</HI> he tells us, <HI>are almo&s;t generally understood the</HI> Rulers <HI>of the churches planted by the Apo&s;tles.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, Suppo&s;ing them to be (what he calls them, <HI>pag.</HI> 14.) <HI>only various Powers &amp; Gifts, wherewith the Go&s;pel-Officers were endu'd;</HI> how will this &s;erve his Cau&s;e! Nay, it will very much hurt it. For, to <HI>whom</HI> &s;hall we refer the&s;e <HI>Powers?</HI> Surely not the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> only, but as well to the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> joyned with them. Whence it will nece&s;&s;arily fol|low, That <HI>Teachers</HI> have the powers of <HI>Government</HI> belonging
<PB N="35" REF="002594_0038_0FDB7E304227F8B0">
to them; and therefore the power of <HI>Ordination</HI> al&s;o, &s;ince the&s;e two are in&s;eperably united, in the Epi&s;copal Scheme. And accordingly Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> on the place (agreeing with our <HI>Author</HI> in his Interpretation of <HI>Governments</HI>) do's expre&s;ly a&s;cribe and appropriate the&s;e <HI>ruling Powers</HI> (as his Phra&s;e is) to the <HI>Teachers</HI> &s;poken of, whom he makes to be the <HI>Pa&s;tors of particular Churches planted by the Apo&s;tles.</HI>&mdash; We will not di&s;|pute then with our Author, whether the <HI>Apo&s;tolic Degree be per|petual,</HI> or not; but let him enjoy his opinion about it, and make as much of it as he can: <HI>provided</HI> he will but concur with tho&s;e his Brethren, (and let <HI>us</HI> quietly enjoy <HI>our</HI> opinion) <HI>That the</HI> Teachers or Pa&s;tors <HI>of particular Congregations have the&s;e</HI> ruling <HI>Powers belonging to them.</HI></P>
<P>YET, it would make one &s;mile to &s;ee how he lays &s;tre&s;s upon the word SET, and to read his De&s;cant on it; when if we con&s;ider the <HI>place</HI> this mono&s;yllable bears in the Text, it mu&s;t needs be of little weight in the pre&s;ent Argument, as referring indifferently to <HI>all</HI> that follows; and con&s;equently taking in (not only the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> &amp;c. but likewi&s;e) the <HI>extraordinary Gifts &amp; Powers</HI> there enumerated, as <HI>&s;et in the Church,</HI> and &s;o (according to him) <HI>immoveably fixed</HI> as the Ordinances of Heaven: which, how <HI>ridiculous</HI> wou'd it be to pretend! In &s;hort, This <HI>Gentleman</HI> mu&s;t allow the power of working <HI>Mi|racles,</HI> the <HI>Gift of Interpreting,</HI> and the <HI>Diver&s;ities of Tongues,</HI> to be but <HI>temporary,</HI> even altho' they are &s;aid to be SET in the Church: and now the <HI>Apo&s;tolic</HI> power of univer&s;al In&s;pection might be but in the <HI>&s;ame &s;en&s;e</HI> &s;et in the Church, and have <HI>a re&s;pect</HI> (like the re&s;t of tho&s;e extraordinary Powers) <HI>only to the fir&s;t planting of the Go&s;pel,</HI> as him&s;elf expre&s;ly owns, <HI>Pag.</HI> 33, 34.</P>
<P>SO that it is egregious <HI>Trifling</HI> to u&s;e this Scripture, as a proof of his Scheme: and his <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> here between <HI>Offices</HI> and <HI>Gifts,</HI> is nothing to his purpo&s;e, tho' (as you've heard) it's much to <HI>mine.</HI> And as for his <HI>Admonition</HI> (under this head) to &s;uch as <HI>pre&s;ume to mutilate &amp; deform the</HI> my&s;tical <HI>Body of CHRIST, by depriving the Church of any of the &s;acred Offices &s;et in it by GOD;</HI> we humbly tru&s;t on <HI>our</HI> part no &s;uch Cen&s;ure is due, however it was pointed at <HI>us;</HI> and therefore let the <HI>Be&s;tower</HI> of it, and his Brethren, take it among them|&s;elves, who pre&s;ume to robb the <HI>Presbyters</HI> in the Church of a great part of their Mini&s;terial Powers, &amp; commit them to other Officers unin&s;tituted by CHRIST, to the no &s;mall damage of his Church in its <HI>Beauty, Integrity</HI> and <HI>Purity.</HI>&mdash; But I

forbear; as &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Re-criminations</HI> however ju&s;t, will do but little Service to my Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>TO <HI>go on</HI> with our <HI>Author:</HI> In the <HI>third</HI> place, He argues from the 4th Chap. to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> where we are told, That our Lord <HI>gave &s;ome Apo&s;tles, &s;ome Prophets, &s;ome Evangeli&s;ts, &s;ome Pa&s;tors &amp; Teachers, &mdash; for the edifying the Body of Chri&s;t; till we all come&mdash; unto a perfect Man,</HI>&mdash; That we henceforth <HI>be no more Children to&s;&s;ed to &amp; fro,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash; Now he boa&s;ts he has here an <HI>unconte&s;tible Testimony,</HI> in favor of his Scheme, <HI>taken from the Ends for which the&s;e Offices were in&s;tituted; with an ex|pre&s;s Declaration how long they were to continue,</HI> that is, <HI>to the End of the world.</HI>&mdash; But this is very ea&s;ily an&s;wered. 'Tis granted, That the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and others mu&s;t certainly <HI>accompli&s;h</HI> the Ends they were given for, &s;ome way or other. And there are two ways, agreable to the twofold Capacity they &s;u&s;tain'd, Ordinary and Extraordinary.</P>
<P>IF you con&s;ider the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> here, in their <HI>Ordinary</HI> Capacity, the Ca&s;e is very plain: their Order doth <HI>actually continue;</HI> and they do properly in their <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors,</HI> &s;erve to the Edification, good Order &amp; Government of the Church, and will do &s;o to the End of Time. Which <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> are <HI>Go&s;pel-Teachers</HI> or <HI>Elders.</HI> For &s;ince our <HI>Author</HI> has not yet been able to prove, That a <HI>Superiority over other Pa&s;tors</HI> was one of the <HI>ordinary</HI> and &s;tand|ing Parts of the Apo&s;tolic Office, it thence follows, that <HI>Pres|byters</HI> may well enough be look'd upon, as <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and we have no Rea&s;on to think any <HI>&s;uperior Order to them</HI> was to continue in the Church. For, as he truly ob&s;erves, <HI>pag.</HI> 42. The Que&s;tion between us is only concerning the <HI>Or|dinary</HI> Powers of the Apo&s;tles, in which <HI>alone</HI> they cou'd have <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors.</HI> And he <HI>him&s;elf</HI> (as I took notice before) acknow|leges, That a <HI>Juri&s;diction over all Churches &amp; Pa&s;tors</HI> was one of tho&s;e <HI>Extraordinary</HI> Powers, of which he &s;ays (as expre&s;ly as I can) at the foot of <HI>pag.</HI> 41. That <HI>they expired with them&s;elves, and that they have no Succe&s;&s;ors in them.</HI></P>
<P>IF then, on the other hand, you con&s;ider the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> in their <HI>Extraordinary</HI> Capacity, you have our <HI>Author</HI>'s own Confe&s;&s;ion, that in <HI>this</HI> they had <HI>no</HI> Succe&s;&s;ors; nor <HI>were to have</HI> any: and &s;o their Superintendent Power being extraordinary, was not to continue in <HI>after Ages,</HI> nor is it obligatory to <HI>us. For</HI> (he &s;ays, <HI>pag</HI> 32.) <HI>if the In&s;titution</HI> of the Apo&s;tles <HI>was ex|traordinary &amp; temporary in any part, it is &s;o far as it was of this nature, no Rule or Standard now.</HI> Neverthele&s;s (I would add)
<PB N="37" REF="002594_0040_0FDB7E32D6013590">
After a &s;ort and in an improper &s;en&s;e, even the <HI>fir&s;t Apo&s;tles</HI> may be &s;aid to continue, that is, In the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Effects</HI> of their Mini&s;try; and to be &s;till &s;erving the Church of CHRIST, by the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Doctrine,</HI> and the &s;tanding Rule of Faith deli|ver'd to us in the New Te&s;tament; which, as Men infallibly in&s;pired for that End, they wrote, and publi&s;h'd, to be han|ded down to Po&s;terity, and &s;pread through the world, for the common benefit of mankind. And the&s;e Apo&s;tolical <HI>Writings</HI> have been pre&s;erved to this day, and will (I tru&s;t) be to the world's End continu'd, the great In&s;trument of the Conver&s;ion and Edification of Souls, under the Conduct of the Spirit of GOD, and of his Mini&s;ters, as in &s;ubordination to him, Workers together with GOD, and building upon the Foundation, which tho&s;e <HI>Ma&s;ter-builders</HI> have laid. So that, in this qualify'd &s;en&s;e, the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> may be &s;aid, even in their <HI>extraordinary</HI> Capacity, yea, and by their <HI>Superintendent</HI> Power too, in the la&s;ting Effects and Influences of it, to continue, <HI>for the work of the Mini&s;try, till we all come,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>BUT here I have <HI>two Remarks</HI> further to make; one on the Author's <HI>way</HI> of <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> upon this Text; and a &s;econd, Upon the <HI>Objection</HI> he rai&s;es, with his <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to it.</P>
<P>HERE then I cannot but take notice, How remarkably this <HI>Gentleman,</HI> in his manner of arguing from this Place (for his pretended Bi&s;hop) agrees with the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Doctors; who from the very &s;ame Text (as Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> ob&s;erves) do argue for an <HI>infallible</HI> Guide <HI>thus;&mdash; CHRIST</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>gave Apo&s;tles, Pastors, &amp; Teachers, that Chri&s;tians might not be</HI> to&s;&s;ed to and fro <HI>with every wind of Doctrine; which End cou'd not be compa&s;&s;ed but by</HI> infallible <HI>Guides.</HI> Moreover, <HI>GOD gave &s;uch Pa&s;tors to &s;erve to the&s;e Ends,</HI> till we all come <HI>to the unity of the Faith, which will not be till the</HI> la&s;t <HI>days of all. Where|fore, till</HI> the End <HI>of the World, the Church must be provided of them, and by them be &s;ecured from being Children to&s;&s;ed to and fro.</HI> Thus the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> argue. And perhaps <HI>They</HI> have as much <HI>Truth</HI> on their &s;ide, as our <HI>Author.</HI> Be&s;ure their Argument &s;eems to be as well founded and as plau&s;ible, for a perpetual Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>infallible Guides</HI> in the Church&punc; as his for a perpetual Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Apo&s;tolical <HI>Superintendents.</HI> But &s;ince the INFAL|LIBLE CHAIR is expre&s;ly renounced by this <HI>Gentleman</HI> him|&s;elf, and that con&s;i&s;tently with the Text we are upon; Me|thinks, it's pity he did not proceed (as he might have done, upon equally ju&s;t Grounds) to reject the EPISCOPAL

THRONE together with it. However, <HI>we</HI> will do it, tho' he hasn't; as firmly believing, that <HI>Infallibility</HI> &amp; <HI>Superintendency</HI> were both alike <HI>peculiar</HI> to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Apo&s;tles (to &s;peak in his own Dialect) and being equally de&s;ign'd only to &s;erve the <HI>Infancy</HI> and fir&s;t Con&s;titution of the Church, they were not to continue.</P>
<P>THE <HI>other Thing</HI> I mention'd, may now be con&s;ider'd. He is aware, it might be <HI>objected</HI> to him, <HI>That in this Text</HI> (viz. Eph. 4.11.) <HI>more Officers are mention'd than he pleads for;</HI> and therefore, to keep clear of the opinion of many Di&s;&s;enters, That the <HI>Apostles, Prophets</HI> and <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> here &s;poken of, were <HI>extraordinary</HI> Officers, He is forced to &s;ay, That <HI>the&s;e different De&s;ignations do not import different</HI> Offices, <HI>but different</HI> Exerci&s;es <HI>of the &s;ame Office,</HI> (pag. 38.) &mdash; But here, how obvious and natural is the Reflection, That by this Principle there is but ONE SINGLE Order in the <HI>Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try;</HI> which is the Thing I am pleading for, and to allow which, is for him intirely to give up the Argument. If <HI>Apo&s;tles, Prophets, Evan|geli&s;ts, Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> do all import only <HI>one</HI> and <HI>the &s;ame Officer,</HI> under various Denominations, as our <HI>Author</HI> &s;eems po&s;itively to a&s;&s;ert, then I &s;ay there's an <HI>End</HI> of the Contro|ver&s;y, and what need we &s;tay any longer upon it!&mdash; How|ever, let us &s;ee how he illu&s;trates the matter by an <HI>Example,</HI> &s;aying, That <HI>an Apo&s;tle, Presbyter, or Deacon, might be a Prophet, Evangeli&s;t, Doctor or Teacher:</HI>&mdash; In which, I doubt he &s;till more and more involves him&s;elf, and di&s;parages his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>For ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE's a <HI>Fallacy</HI> in this In&s;tance, in that one thing which &s;hould be in the <HI>Predicate,</HI> He puts into the place of the <HI>Subject,</HI> namely, an <HI>Apostle.</HI> If he wou'd &s;peak con&s;i&s;tently with the Account he gives before, of the&s;e <HI>different De&s;ignations,</HI> and give a <HI>parallel</HI> In&s;tance, It mu&s;t run thus, A <HI>Presbyter</HI> or <HI>Deacon,</HI> (or a <HI>third</HI> Per&s;on, if he could find out &s;uch an one; let him &s;ay, a <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> if he will) might be an <HI>Apo&s;tle, Prophet, Evangeli&s;t, Pa&s;tor</HI> or <HI>Teacher.</HI> For <HI>Apostle</HI> is one of tho&s;e <HI>De&s;ig|nations</HI> in the Text; all which ju&s;t now he &s;aid, imported only <HI>different Exerci&s;es</HI> of the &s;ame Office.</P>
<P>BUT if any will attempt to excu&s;e him from the Charge of a Fallacy, by &s;aying, He meant to <HI>except</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> out of that Number, and &s;poke only of the <HI>other</HI> De&s;ignations that follow; tho' it happens not to be &s;o cautiou&s;ly worded: then let me argue upon the matter thus,&mdash; <HI>Either all the De&s;igna|tions here do import di&s;tinct</HI> Offices, <HI>or they all of them do not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="002594_0042_0FDB7E35B30D0010">IF <HI>all</HI> do imply di&s;tinct <HI>Offices;</HI> then the&s;e are all either ordinary or extraordinary, and take them in which &s;en&s;e he will, he mu&s;t di&s;tort his own Scheme. Nay further, if any &s;hou'd &s;ay for him, <HI>They are</HI> BOTH (&s;ome being Ordinary, and others Extraordinary) and to be taken <HI>in &s;en&s;u divi&s;o;</HI> I doubt this Di&s;tinction would not help him neither: for I be|lieve, by the &s;ame Rules that <HI>any</HI> of them can be prov'd <HI>Ex|traordinary,</HI> we mu&s;t conclude the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> particularly to be &s;o.

<P>BUT, If all the&s;e De&s;ignations do <HI>not</HI> imply &s;o many dif|ferent <HI>Offices,</HI> then I argue thus,&mdash; Either they are <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them proper Offices, and <HI>others</HI> only different <HI>Exerci&s;es;</HI> or el&s;e they are all but <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI> of one Office.</P>

Where is there any Colour of <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> in the Text, between The&s;e and the Re&s;t that follow? Does not the Enumeration run thus, <HI>&s;ome</HI> Apo&s;tles, <HI>and &s;ome</HI> Prophets, <HI>and &s;ome</HI> Evangeli&s;ts, <HI>and &s;ome</HI> Pa&s;tors and Teachers! So that there's no <HI>mark</HI> of Di&s;tinction between the two Fir&s;t, and the Re&s;t: and more|over, by the &s;ame Rule, that the two Fir&s;t, viz. <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Prophets,</HI> may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd one from the other, may al&s;o the two next, <HI>Evangelists</HI> &amp; <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> be di&s;tingui&s;h'd, and call'd different Offices. Yea, and by parity of Rea&s;on, If he calls <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> &amp; <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> one and the &s;ame Officer, I may as well call <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and Pa&s;tors the &s;ame. According to him, a <HI>Pre&s;|byter</HI> might be a <HI>Prophet, Evangeli&s;t, Pa&s;tor</HI> or <HI>Teacher:</HI> and I will add upon as good Grounds, <HI>That he might be an</HI> Apo&s;tle <HI>too,</HI> as far as the <HI>ordinary</HI> Power of an Apo&s;tle extended; which was only to <HI>govern</HI> the Church, <HI>ordain</HI> Officers, <HI>preach</HI> the <HI>Word,</HI> &amp; <HI>admini&s;ter</HI> the <HI>Sacraments:</HI> for (I &s;ay again) he hath not yet proved, That a <HI>Superiority</HI> over other Pa&s;tors was one of the <HI>ordinary</HI> powers of an Apo&s;tle.&mdash; And by the way, This would have &s;erved as well for an An&s;wer to one of his former Texts, that is, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12 28. For there is as much Rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>different De&s;ignations</HI> in <HI>that,</HI> as in this, to <HI>import only different Exerci&s;es of the &s;ame Office.</HI>&mdash; But thus much for the fir&s;t Thing I ob&s;erv'd in our <HI>Author</HI>'s In&s;tance.</P>

<P>HERE's a plain <HI>Contradiction</HI> to what he &s;ays el&s;ewhere.

<P>THUS I have fully and impartially con&s;ider'd the <HI>Three</HI> great Scripture-Arguments he brings.</P>
<P>AND now upon the whole, Who can forbear pitying his <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> as de&s;perate, that needs the help of &s;uch little <HI>Tricks</HI> and <HI>Windings</HI> and <HI>Double-Dealings</HI> to maintain it; and the <HI>Man,</HI> as very forgetful at lea&s;t, and not a Ma&s;ter of his own Scheme, that commits &s;uch egregious <HI>Blunders</HI> &amp; <HI>Self Contradictions!</HI></P>
<P>WELL; Our Author having (as he thinks) e&s;tabli&s;h't his Point, viz <HI>That Authoritative In&s;pection over Churches &amp; Pa&s;tors, was one of the ordinary &amp; continuing parts of the Apo&s;tolick Office, in which they were to have Succe&s;&s;ors;</HI> He comes now in the 4th &amp; <HI>last</HI> place, to &s;hew, that BISHOPS are the true <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> of the Apo&s;tles, and that in <HI>Them</HI> is the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Government</HI> over Pa&s;tors &amp; Teachers <HI>continu'd</HI> in the Church. Now to illu&s;trate and confirm this, he ob&s;erves to us, <HI>Pag.</HI> 43. That the <HI>Apo&s;tle|&s;hip</HI> is (in <HI>Acts</HI> 1.20.) expre&s;ly call'd an <HI>Epi&s;copacy;</HI> and hence <HI>the Apo&s;tles were properly and actually Bi&s;hops.</HI>&mdash; Says he &s;o? Why then, at the &s;ame Rate of arguing, We may infer that <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> are <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> too; becau&s;e in another Chapter of the &s;ame Book, (viz. Act. 20.) <HI>The Elders</HI> of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> are expre&s;ly call'd <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI> Yea, by the &s;ame Rule, we may argue that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> them&s;elves were properly and actually <HI>Pre&s;byters;</HI> ina&s;much as two of them, <HI>Peter</HI> &amp; <HI>John,</HI> expre&s;ly call them&s;elves &s;o. The Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> in two of his Epi&s;tles, &s;alutes his Friends, under no other Name, than that cho&s;en one, <HI>The Elder</HI> &mdash;. Po&s;&s;ibly he was the olde&s;t Apo&s;tle now living, or the only one &s;urviving, of that extraordinary Cha|racter: and this aged Servant of the Lord, willing to counte|nance the <HI>continu'd</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;tanding</HI> Mini&s;try, a&s;&s;umed only the more ordinary and common Title of <HI>Elder:</HI> though, being now the fir&s;t and mo&s;t eminent Mini&s;ter in the Church, he &s;tyles him&s;elf emphatically, <HI>THE Elder.</HI> &mdash; And then the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> exhorting the <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> (1 Epi&s;t 5 1.) &s;tyles him&s;elf <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Con&s;enior,</HI> or FELLOW <HI>Pre&s;byter;</HI> as if he claimed no Superiority over them and &s;tood upon a Level with them.&mdash; But where now do we find the&s;e or any other

Apo&s;tles calling them&s;elves <HI>Bi&s;hops?</HI> Doubtle&s;s we &s;hou'd have been told of it, if they had done &s;o.

If &s;o; then he trifles &s;trangely, and abu&s;es his Reader with the <HI>Ambiguity</HI> of a word, which <HI>He</HI> puts one Con&s;truction up|on, and the Presbyterians another. <HI>He</HI> u&s;es the word. <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> in the modern <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Sen&s;e, as importing an Officer <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to a Presbyter: but <HI>We</HI> affirm, this is not the ancient <HI>&s;criptural</HI> Sen&s;e. Let them, who &s;ay it is, produce any place in the Bible, where the word is &s;o u&s;ed, if they can. It is to be found 6 or 7 times in the New Te&s;tament: but it every where makes &s;o evidently again&s;t the <HI>Prelatical</HI> Sen&s;e, that the wi&s;er &amp; more &s;ober Prelati&s;ts generally <HI>&s;hun</HI> all Places where the Word is u&s;ed, as being nothing to their purpo&s;e, but rather tending to the Confu&s;ion of their Cau&s;e. And when they come to an&s;wer our Arguments from &s;uch Places, they will not fix on any po&s;itive Sen&s;e contrary to our's, but only &s;tudy <HI>Eva&s;ions;</HI> and act like cowardly Soldiers flying from a powerful Enemy, who tru&s;t to their <HI>Heels,</HI> not to their <HI>Weapons:</HI> or if any have more Courage, and re&s;olve at all Ad|ventures to &s;tand it out, how often do they charge upon one another, and fly in each other's Face!&mdash; To In&s;tance in one Text, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.1. Where <HI>Paul</HI> &s;alutes the Saints at <HI>Philippi, with the Bi&s;hops &amp; Deacons.</HI> One Party of them &s;ays, Tho&s;e were <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Bi&s;hops; and here they take quite different paths: One &s;ays, <HI>They were the Bi&s;hops of the</HI> neighboring <HI>Citys, met for &s;ome Con&s;ultation at</HI> Philippi: Another &s;ays, <HI>No; They were not at</HI> Philippi, <HI>but with</HI> Paul.

by the Apo&s;tles: but then another &s;ays, There <HI>was</HI> &s;uch an <HI>Inferior</HI> Order, and would have it denoted here by the <HI>Deacons.</HI> Yet further, There's another Party, who &s;ay, The&s;e Bi&s;hops were <HI>nothing</HI> but Presbyters; <HI>&s;imple</HI> Presbyters, not having power of Juri&s;diction; which the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> in their times re&s;erved to Them&s;elves; and &s;o there was no &s;uch Officer as a <HI>Prelate</HI> between the Apo&s;tles, and the Presbyters, Finally, There are &s;ome of them, who hold, That by <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> here are to be under&s;tood <HI>both</HI> the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and his <HI>Pre&s;byters;</HI> for that the Name was then common to both Orders, and the higher Rank includes the lower.&mdash; What Contention and Confu&s;ion is here among the learned Advocates for <HI>Prelacy!</HI> You &s;ee this <HI>one</HI> Text has &s;o gravel'd 'em, that they know not which way to turn them&s;elves, nor how to come off: they can't agree among them&s;elves upon any tolerable Eva&s;ion, and they &s;eem a&s;ham'd of one another's &s;ophi&s;tical Attempts.</P>
<P>BUT I now return to our <HI>Author;</HI> who to confirm the Point he is upon, viz. <HI>That</HI> Bi&s;hops <HI>are Succe&s;&s;ors to the Apo&s;tles in their power &amp; Authority over Pa&s;tors,</HI> proceeds (<HI>pag.</HI> 45.) to offer another Argument, taken from the <HI>Apo&s;tles conferring upon</HI> others <HI>the Apo&s;tolick Power, in their own Time, which</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>they would never have done, if they had not concluded it was to be</HI> tran&s;mitted <HI>from them to others in a continual Succe&s;&s;ion, to the</HI> End <HI>of the World.</HI> I might make &s;everal <HI>Remarks</HI> on this Pa&s;|&s;age; but I &s;hall confine my &s;elf to the main Thing, that is, to inquire into the Truth of his <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> That <HI>Apostles</HI> did <HI>actually confer</HI> Apo&s;tolic <HI>Power</HI> on <HI>others.</HI> &mdash; It is not enough to &s;ay there were <HI>other</HI> Apo&s;tles, be&s;ides tho&s;e <HI>Eleven,</HI> which CHRIST left in Office at his A&s;cen&s;ion. For <HI>our Lord</HI> might afterwards rai&s;e up as many as he plea&s;ed: but if their <HI>Call</HI> was <HI>immediate,</HI> their Mi&s;&s;ion from CHRIST alone, without the Intervention of Men, or their Qualifications <HI>extraordinary</HI> And <HI>peculiar,</HI> it affords no Argument at all of his de&s;igning a perpetual <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> of an Order of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to ordinary Teachers. Hence then our <HI>Author</HI> mu&s;t in&s;tance in &s;uch as receiv'd the <HI>Apo&s;tolate</HI> in an <HI>ordinary</HI> manner, by a <HI>human</HI> Call and Ordination: or el&s;e his in&s;tances are foreign to the purpo&s;e, and prove nothing.</P>
<P>NOW in <HI>Pag.</HI> 45 &amp; 46. He offers &s;everal In&s;tances; but &s;uch as will hardly bear an Examination He fir&s;t in&s;tances in <HI>Matthias:</HI> But will he &s;ay this Apo&s;tle was called in an <HI>ordinary</HI> manner? Nay, Does he not own him&s;elf, It was <HI>by the</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="002594_0047_0FDB7E43F67037E0">
DIRECTION <HI>of GOD, that</HI> Matthias <HI>was received into the Num|ber of the Apo&s;tles?</HI> And were not the <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> and the <HI>Requi&s;ites,</HI> that are mention'd (<HI>Act.</HI> 1.21, 22.) as nece&s;&s;ary to qualify him to be joyned with the Eleven Apo&s;tles; I &s;ay, were not the&s;e things <HI>extraordinary?</HI> It would then a&s;toni&s;h one to think, any Man in his Wits &s;hou'd offer &s;uch an In|&s;tance as this in Plea for <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> being the true Succe&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles!&mdash; The In&s;tance of <HI>James,</HI> is exceeding imperti|nent; &s;ince it appears very plainly the <HI>Author</HI> him&s;elf believ'd <HI>him</HI> to be one of the <HI>Twelve;</HI> and therefore to have his Call <HI>immediately</HI> from <HI>CHRIST.</HI> And as for what he in&s;inuates about this Apo&s;tle's being <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> nothing that he refers us to for proof, will bear him out in this fond Conceit. The next In&s;tance he brings is <HI>Paul;</HI> but with what propriety I can't imagin; e&s;pecially &s;ince he him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es, that he was <HI>immediately</HI> called by CHRIST.&mdash; His la&s;t In&s;tance is <HI>Barnabas,</HI> who (he tells us) was called in the ORDINARY <HI>manner;</HI> that is, He had not an <HI>immediate</HI> Divine Call, but the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> conferred his Apo&s;tolical Power upon him. But how does that appear? Sure I am, we read of no &s;uch Thing in the place he refers us to, <HI>Act.</HI> 4.36. Nay, we have very &s;ufficient Grounds to conclude, that <HI>Barnabas,</HI> when he received this new Name from the Apo&s;tles, was no more than a <HI>Teacher</HI> or <HI>Evangeli&s;t.</HI> We don't hear of his doing any thing more than <HI>preaching the Word,</HI> for a con&s;iderable Time after this. Nay, not till after (what we read of, <HI>Acts</HI> 13.) his <HI>Seperation</HI> (together with <HI>Paul</HI>) to a &s;pecial Mini&s;try, by the hands of <HI>certain Teachers,</HI> at the Direction of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t:</HI> After which indeed we find him call'd an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> ordaining <HI>Elders,</HI> &amp;c. Here then, There are two Things our <HI>Author</HI> mu&s;t grant. 1. If <HI>Barnabas</HI> was an Apo&s;tle really, and &s;eperated to his Apo&s;tle&s;hip in an <HI>ordinary</HI> manner, it mu&s;t be at <HI>this</HI> Time: whence it will follow (contrary to his darling Principle) That the Power of <HI>Ordination</HI> is not the <HI>peculiar</HI> Privilege of an Officer <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to Presbyters or ordinary Teachers; but that Teachers may ordain Teachers, yea Bi&s;hops and Apo&s;tles too. Or el&s;e 2. He mu&s;t own <HI>Barnabas</HI>'s Call to be <HI>immediate</HI> &amp; not in the <HI>ordinary</HI> manner: &s;o con&s;equently the In&s;tance not at all to his purpo&s;e. &mdash; The <HI>matter of Fact,</HI> which our <HI>Author</HI> brought the&s;e In&s;tances to prove, was, That the APOSTLES <HI>them&s;elves conferred Apo&s;tolical Power on others.</HI> But I be|lieve every unbya&s;s'd Reader will be of opinion, that all his In&s;tances are impertinent, and will vote the <HI>Gentleman</HI> wholly

be&s;ide his Cu&s;hion.&mdash;And now having thus &s;ap't the Foun|dation, hence the Argument he builds upon it in favor of his beloved Prelacy, by natural Con&s;equence falls to the Ground, and turns to nothing.</P>
<P>BUT moreover, to enforce what he had &s;aid relating to the&s;e Apo&s;tles, our <HI>Author</HI> proceeds to in&s;tance in &s;ome <HI>others,</HI> who were <HI>rai&s;ed from among the ordinary Pastors, to the</HI> Apo&s;tolical <HI>or</HI> Epi&s;copal <HI>Order; and endu'd with Authority over Churches and their Pa&s;tors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 47. HE in&s;tances in <HI>Timothy,</HI> and endeavours to prove, <HI>That He was Bi&s;hop of the Church of</HI> Ephe&s;us.&mdash; But how does he prove it? Why, becau&s;e he had committed to him the &s;e|veral <HI>Powers of Ordination &amp; Juri&s;diction.</HI> But this is of little weight; unle&s;s he can further prove, that <HI>Timothy</HI> had a PAR|TICULAR and fixed RELATION to that Church; at lea&s;t that he had the SOLE Power in him&s;elf; that he was com|mi&s;&s;ion'd to ordain &amp; govern ALONE, and the <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> there ab&s;olutely excluded: Since otherwi&s;e, by the &s;ame Rule, and way of Rea&s;oning, we may as well conclude that <HI>Timothy</HI> was to be <HI>&s;ole</HI> TEACHER at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and none to <HI>preach</HI> but he; becau&s;e he is exhorted to <HI>give him&s;elf to Reading, to Exhortation &amp; Doctrine; to preach the Word, to he instant in &s;ea&s;on, out of &s;ea&s;on.</HI> 'Tis not enough to &s;ay, <HI>Timothy</HI> had the&s;e &amp; tho&s;e Powers, and was to do this and t'other Thing: but it mu&s;t be prov'd that the <HI>Elders of Ephe&s;us</HI> had not the &s;ame Powers, and cou'd not do the &s;ame Things, (even tho' they had the &s;ame Qua|lifications) that they might not <HI>lay on Hands,</HI> might not <HI>reprove one another,</HI> as there was occa&s;ion, and the like. And then, It mu&s;t be proved that <HI>Timothy</HI> had tho&s;e Powers, and exerci&s;ed them, in the Capacity of a <HI>Bi&s;hop;</HI> not as one having <HI>extraordi|nary</HI> Authority, and by virtue of extraordinary Gifts; much le&s;s as being an <HI>Elder:</HI> and that he had not the <HI>A&s;&s;istence</HI> of the other Elders.&mdash; Particularly it mu&s;t be proved, That he had the <HI>&s;ole</HI> Power of <HI>Ordination,</HI> and acted <HI>&s;ingly</HI> herein, if ever the Prelati&s;ts wou'd gain their point. But now how improbable is this? Seeing all the <HI>Ordinations</HI> we read of were performed by a <HI>Plurality</HI> of Ordainers: and e&s;pecially &s;eeing, if <HI>Paul</HI> was concern'd in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy,</HI> he took the hands of the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> with his own: for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e but that <HI>Timothy</HI> wou'd follow the Pattern of <HI>his own</HI> Ordination, and not a&s;&s;ume more Power than the <HI>A|po&s;tle</HI> him&s;elf claimed.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="002594_0049_0FDB7E47B5F585B8">MOREOVER, It is ob&s;ervable, by the &s;ame way of Rea&s;on|ing that our <HI>Author</HI> makes u&s;e of here, to prove <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Epi&s;copacy, the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> do infer <HI>Peter</HI>'s Supremacy from other places of Scripture (as <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.19 <HI>Joh.</HI> 21.15.) Where <HI>CHRIST</HI> gave In&s;tructions, Charges and Powers to the <HI>A|po&s;tles;</HI> u&s;ing the <HI>&s;ingular</HI> number, and directing his Speech to <HI>Peter</HI> in <HI>particular,</HI> even when the <HI>other</HI> Apo&s;tles were by. And indeed, I think, if the mere Form of Expre&s;&s;ion is any thing to be built upon, the <HI>Papists</HI> may as well pretend, that what <HI>CHRIST</HI> here &s;aid to <HI>Peter,</HI> was <HI>per&s;onal</HI> and peculiar to him, as the <HI>Prelatists</HI> appropriate to <HI>Timothy</HI> what <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays in his Epi&s;tles to him about Government &amp; Ordination.

If <HI>Paul</HI>'s Juri&s;diction over <HI>all Churches</HI> was extraordi|nary, then it &s;eems to me that the Juri&s;diction he is &s;aid to exerci&s;e over the Church &amp; Pa&s;tors of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> in particular, by the mediation of <HI>Timothy</HI> (which was &s;pecifically the &s;ame with that) mu&s;t be likewi&s;e extraordinary <HI>Timothy</HI>'s pretended E|pi&s;copacy cou'd be no other than the Exerci&s;e of Apo&s;tolical univer&s;al Juri&s;diction, under a particular Application: and this particular Tru&s;t mu&s;t cea&s;e together with the extraordi|nary Power that was the Foundation &amp; Source of it.&mdash; Moreover, It is not unworthy of Con&s;ideration, That in the exerci&s;e of this &s;uppo&s;ed Epi&s;copal Government, <HI>Timothy</HI> had an <HI>in&s;pired Apo&s;tle</HI> to direct him: And now will any imagin

<P>THUS you &s;ee the two In&s;tances of <HI>Timothy</HI> &amp; <HI>Titus,</HI> which our <HI>Author</HI> thought wou'd afford convincing Arguments for a &s;ettled <HI>Prelacy</HI> in the Church, do conclude nothing at all in favour of it. It was therefore ingenuou&s;ly done of Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> to de&s;ert his Brethren, by making tho&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions, which we find in the <HI>Preface</HI> to his Commentary upon <HI>Titus.</HI> "As to the great Controver&s;y (&s;aith he) whether <HI>Timothy</HI> &amp; <HI>Titus</HI> were indeed made <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> the one of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> the other of <HI>Crete;</HI> I confe&s;s I can find nothing of this matter in any Writer of the <HI>first three</HI> Centuries, nor any Intimation that they bore that Name &mdash;.

<P>I come now to our <HI>Author</HI>'s la&s;t In&s;tance, viz. <HI>The</HI> Angels <HI>of the &s;even Churches of A&s;ia, which</HI> (he tells us) <HI>were Per&s;ons of the</HI> Apo&s;tolical <HI>&amp;</HI> Epi&s;copal <HI>Order.</HI> But his Argument here,
<PB N="50" REF="002594_0053_0FDB7E5237269378">
is as weak and unconcluding as any of the Former. For there is no Evidence at all, nor any Shadow of Rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e, that tho&s;e <HI>Angels</HI> were <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops,</HI> or &s;uch as had Authority over Presbyters. There is nothing in the Word <HI>Angel,</HI> that will yield any Demon&s;tration of it. Whether you con&s;ider the Etymology of the <HI>Name,</HI> or the Style of the <HI>Apoca|lyp&s;e,</HI> there's nothing to forbid our taking it in a <HI>Collective</HI> Sen&s;e, for the Body of the <HI>Clergy</HI> or <HI>Presbyters.</HI> And if we look into the <HI>Epistles</HI> to tho&s;e Churches, we &s;hall find many Expre&s;&s;ions that favour this Con&s;truction: but not a word (that I can &s;ee) countenancing the Epi&s;copal Opinion. Nay, if we &s;hou'd allow every Angel to be a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Per&s;on; the ut|mo&s;t you can &s;uppo&s;e him to be, is a <HI>Senior Pastor</HI> in a Church; or the <HI>Moderator</HI> of a Presbytery, approved by &s;ome who are in their Judgment &amp; Practice very Anti-prelatical. There is not the lea&s;t Hint given, as if the&s;e <HI>Angels</HI> had Juri&s;diction over any inferior Mini&s;ters; much le&s;s the <HI>&s;ole</HI> power of Govern|ment, and a <HI>Negative</HI> upon Pa&s;tors and Churches: without which Things, there can be no rational Inference (from tho&s;e Angels) in favour of <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops.</HI> 'Tis indeed one of the mo&s;t <HI>noi&s;y</HI> &amp; blu&s;tering Arguments made u&s;e of on the Epi&s;copal &s;ide, but perhaps equally <HI>&s;hallow,</HI> and &s;en&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS I have faithfully examin'd all the <HI>In&s;tances,</HI> our <HI>Au|thor</HI> has thought fit to mention, for the proof of his Point, <HI>That the Apo&s;tolic Power over</HI> Pa&s;tors <HI>is continu'd in the Church, in the hands of</HI> Bi&s;hops. And I am apt to flatter my &s;elf, that I have <HI>di&s;arm'd</HI> him of all his &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Precedents,</HI> have <HI>beaten him off from his &s;trong Holds,</HI> and turn'd mo&s;t of his <HI>own</HI> Weapons upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>NOW it remains to con&s;ider the <HI>Replies</HI> he has made to the Scripture-Proofs, which <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> bring: but before I pa&s;s to that, let me look back a little, and con&s;ider an incidental Pa&s;&s;age or two of our <HI>Author</HI>'s, under the former head.</P>
<P>AT the bottom of <HI>pag.</HI> 48.

of precedence or pre-eminence. If the Epi&s;coparians had only a&s;&s;erted it to be both lawful &amp; u&s;eful, that among Presbyters who are, by the fir&s;t In&s;titution, all equal, there &s;hould be one for Order's &s;ake, placed above the re&s;t, and called the Bi&s;hop; we &s;hould not upon that account have contended with them, or &s;eparated from them. Who knows not that the foreign Churches, that are under Presbyterian Government, have, in their Synods &amp; Cla&s;&s;es, <HI>Moderators, Prolocutors,</HI> &amp;c which are by Experience found nece&s;&s;ary? And if men had been entru&s;ted with tho&s;e Offices in our Churches, not barely upon occa&s;ion, but <HI>for life,</HI> or <HI>as long as they behav'd them&s;elves well in them,</HI> I hardly think any Quarrel would have ri&s;en upon this head. Nay, &s;o earne&s;tly did our Mini&s;ters de&s;ire Peace, that if our Bi&s;hops had been obliged to govern their Churches, with the Con&s;ent and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Presbyters, they would have born with it, rather than have been deprived of the <HI>Publick ex|erci&s;e</HI> of their <HI>Mini&s;try.</HI> For they thus con&s;idered with them|&s;elves; that it was enough for them, if they pre&s;erved entire the power they received from GOD, and left the Con&s;ecration whereby the Presbyters are made Bi&s;hops, as a u&s;ele&s;s thing, to tho&s;e who were &s;atisfied with the Law|fulne&s;s &amp; Expediency of it. This then is our Judgment, that the di&s;tinction our Adver&s;aries make between Presbyter and Bi&s;hop is groundle&s;s, being no where made in the Scripture; and that CHRIST is alone a Monarch in His Church; and that He hath never appointed a Monarchical Form of Government to be practi&s;ed in it;</Q> &s;ince we no where find any &s;uch thing taught, either by <HI>CHRIST him&s;elf,</HI> or by his <HI>holy Apo&s;tles, to whom he gave &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion and Power to plant, and &s;ettle, and govern his Church, in his name. Con|cerning whom therefore,</HI> (to borrow our <HI>Author</HI>'s words, <HI>pag.</HI> 50, 51.) <HI>we cannot entertain the lea&s;t doubt in our minds but that they would be mo&s;t faithful &amp; exact, in &s;ettling that Order, and In&s;tituting tho&s;e Officers in all fully con&s;tituted Churches, which their Lord had appointed; and would be careful to leave the Church, at their Death under the &s;ame Order &amp; Government, furni&s;hed with the &s;ame Offi|ces &amp; Mini&s;ters, which CHRIST him&s;elf her Lord, had in&s;tituted &amp; appointed for her Edification.</HI></P>

<P>THE fir&s;t text mentioned is in <HI>Act.</HI> 20. where the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> having <HI>&s;ent from Miletus to Ephe&s;us,</HI> ver. 17. <HI>and called the Elders of the Church,</HI> &s;o charges them, ver. 28. <HI>Take heed therefore unto your &s;elves, and unto all the Flock over which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you</HI> OVERSEERS (or, <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> as the &s;ame word is el&s;e|where tran&s;lated) <HI>to feed the Church of God,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;Here it is as plain as any thing can be, that the <HI>&s;ame</HI> per&s;ons who are cal|led <HI>Elders</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> ver. 17. are called al&s;o <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> ver. 28 and were <HI>&s;uch Officers</HI> as there were <HI>more than one of in a Church;</HI> and therefore could not be <HI>Bi&s;hops properly &s;o called</HI> in our <HI>Au|thor</HI>'s &s;en&s;e. To this our <HI>Author</HI> an&s;wers that <HI>They &s;ay</HI> (it mu&s;t be only by gue&s;s; for there is no foundation for it in the Text) <HI>that the Apo&s;tle called both Bi&s;hops &amp; Pre&s;byters unto him. and that the Clergy of all the Cities thereabout were there; &s;o that what he &s;ays,</HI> ver. 28. <HI>was principally directed to the</HI> Bi&s;hops, <HI>and by way of reflection to the</HI> Presbyters. If we &s;hould grant this were true, yet &s;till their <HI>Names</HI> are u&s;ed <HI>promi&s;cuou&s;ly.</HI> But it is &s;o far from being true, that it is directly contrary both to the letter of the text and the circum&s;tances of the Apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. IF the Clergy of all the neighbouring Cities had been there, the Apo&s;tle (we may conclude) would have &s;aid <HI>Flocks</HI> and Churches, and not <HI>Flock</HI> and Church. And</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Apo&s;tle was now <HI>ha&s;tening, if po&s;&s;ible, to be at Jeru&s;alem on the day of Penteco&s;t,</HI> ver. 16. and therefore would not call at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> him&s;elf, le&s;t he &s;hould be detained too long; but &s;ent for the <HI>Elders</HI> of the Church to come to him at <HI>Miletus:</HI> which makes it the mo&s;t unlikely thing in the world, that he would tarry there till the Clergy of <HI>all</HI> the Cities about <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> could be called together. So that it ap|pears plainly both from the manner of the Apo&s;tle's Expre&s;|&s;ion, and from the great ha&s;te he was then in, that none but the <HI>Elders</HI> of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> were there pre&s;ent; whom the Apo&s;tle calls <HI>Bi&s;hops of the Holy Gho&s;t's making.</HI> To all this our <HI>Author</HI> hath nothing to oppo&s;e, but a mere Gue&s;s, which
<PB N="55" REF="002594_0058_0FDB7E5CB7A45E98">
he &s;eems not willing to take the Credit of to him&s;elf; and which if allowed, won't &s;erve the turn he u&s;es it for. Before I di&s;mi&s;s this Text, I would ob&s;erve further, that the Apo&s;tle charges the&s;e <HI>Elders</HI> to <HI>feed the Church.</HI> &amp;c. Now <HI>feeding</HI> being a metaphor taken from the bu&s;ine&s;s of a <HI>Shepherd,</HI> implies go|vernment as well as in&s;truction. So that from this Text it appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT <HI>the &s;ame Per&s;ons were called</HI> ELDERS <HI>&amp;</HI> BISHOPS.</P>
<P>And</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT <HI>in one Church there were &s;everal</HI> ELDERS <HI>all</HI> ALIKE <HI>concerned in the Government of it;</HI> And therefore ac|cording to the Epi&s;coparian Scheme, inve&s;ted with the power of <HI>Ordination</HI> al&s;o, &amp; all other Powers that belong to the highe&s;t Office in the Church. So that this Text proves an <HI>Identity</HI> of <HI>Office</HI> as well as <HI>name:</HI> To which I will add,</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT in all probability this charge was given to <HI>tho&s;e Elders,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of <HI>Timothy,</HI> who appears from <HI>ver.</HI> 4. to have been one of the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s attendants in this Voyage. And if &s;o, had the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> been of our <HI>Author</HI>'s opinion, that he was the Bi&s;hop of that Church, it is very &s;trange he &s;hould take no notice at all of <HI>him,</HI> as concerned with it; nor give any charge to the Presbyters to pay due re&s;pect unto their <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> (who&s;e <HI>Youth</HI> might tempt them to <HI>de&s;pi&s;e him)</HI> as well as <HI>to take heed to all the Flock.</HI></P>
<P>THE next Pa&s;&s;age mentioned is that in <HI>Titus,</HI> Chap 1. where after the Apo&s;tle hath laid down &s;ome of the qualifi|cations of the <HI>Elders whom he left Titus to ordain in every City,</HI> he gives this rea&s;on <HI>ver.</HI> 7. for in&s;i&s;ting on tho&s;e qualifications: <HI>For a</HI> Bi&s;hop <HI>mu&s;t be blamele&s;s as the Steward of God,</HI> &amp;c. which wou'd be no rea&s;on at all, unle&s;s the Apo&s;tle intended the <HI>&s;ame Officer</HI> by the Bi&s;hop in the 7th <HI>ver.</HI> which he did by the <HI>Elders</HI> before. To this, I can't find that our <HI>Author</HI> &s;ays any thing, which hath &s;o much as the lea&s;t tendency to take off the force of it. But he &s;ays one thing to perplex him&s;elf and his Cau&s;e, viz. <HI>That there were Pre&s;byters before at</HI> Crete, <HI>and</HI> Ti|tus <HI>was to ordain &s;ome of them Bi&s;hops;</HI> whereas he had &s;aid before <HI>pa</HI> 48. <HI>That an Epi&s;copal Power &amp; Authority was con|ferred on</HI> Titus <HI>over the Churches in</HI> Crete. From which two pa&s;&s;ages laid together one would think, that <HI>Titus</HI> was to ordain <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> in &s;ome of the Cities in <HI>Crete, inferiour</HI> to him|&s;elf; whereas the Scheme of our <HI>Author</HI> and his Brethren is, <HI>That there is no &s;uperiority or power of one Bi&s;hop over another.</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="002594_0059_0FDB7E5F029938E0">
Be&s;ides, as Critics ob&s;erve, the original word here rendred to <HI>ordain,</HI> will not bear &s;uch a &s;en&s;e: it &s;ignifies plainly to <HI>con|&s;titute</HI> &amp; <HI>appoint.</HI> And &s;o here it mu&s;t needs mean the <HI>Ordi|nation</HI> of per&s;ons to the <HI>office</HI> of <HI>Pre&s;byters;</HI> and not the <HI>advance|ment</HI> of <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> to be <HI>Bi&s;hops. Pre&s;byter</HI> or <HI>Elder</HI> here is the <HI>Capacity, to which</HI> per&s;ons were to be <HI>ordained;</HI> and not <HI>from which</HI> they were to be <HI>promoted.</HI></P>
<P>IN the next place he tells us that 1 Tim. 3.2,&mdash;7. <HI>is to be understood of Bi&s;hops properly &s;o called, that were to be ordained to pre&s;ide over other Cities, as Timothy did over Ephe&s;us.</HI> But this won't &s;erve his turn; for <HI>Timothy</HI> was <HI>to abide at Ephe&s;us,</HI> ch 1. ver. 3. and not to travel from City to City to <HI>ordain Bi&s;hops.</HI> Be&s;ides, if the Apo&s;tle had known any middle &s;ort of Officer, called a <HI>Pre&s;byter,</HI> between the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> here mentioned, and the <HI>Deacon</HI> de&s;cribed afterwards, in the &s;ame Chapter, it is very &s;trange he &s;hould give <HI>no character</HI> of <HI>him,</HI> when he is &s;o carefully in&s;tructing <HI>Timothy, how to behave him&s;elf in the Hou&s;e of God,</HI> that he might know what manner of per&s;on to put into this Office al&s;o, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion for it. And therefore we cannot but conclude, that a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and a <HI>Pre&s;byter</HI> were the &s;ame thing in the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s account, and that he knew no other <HI>ordinary Officers</HI> in the Church, but <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;|byters</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI></P>
<P>THE la&s;t Text he mentions is Phil. 1.1. <HI>Paul &amp; Timothy the Servants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to all the &s;aints in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which are at Philippi, with the Bi&s;hops &amp; Deacons.</HI> From this text we gather that the <HI>Government</HI> of the Church at <HI>Philippi</HI> was not lodged in the hands of a <HI>&s;ingle Per&s;on,</HI> or a <HI>Bi&s;hop, properly &s;o called,</HI> in our <HI>Author</HI>'s &s;en&s;e; but in the hands of a <HI>plurality</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;bytery;</HI> and that there was no <HI>middle Order</HI> in the Church of <HI>Philippi,</HI> between the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> here mentioned.</P>
<P>TO this our <HI>Author</HI> an&s;wers, fir&s;t. <HI>That the&s;e words may be under&s;tood of the Bi&s;hops of</HI> Philippi, <HI>and other neighbouring Cities, who were wont to convene and meet together.</HI></P>
<P>MY reply is, 1. That this Epi&s;tle is written to a <HI>Church;</HI> that therefore when it &s;ays <HI>to the &s;aints which are at</HI> Philippi, it is to be under&s;tood of the Saints that dwelt there and con|&s;tituted that Church. And in like manner ought the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> to be under&s;tood of tho&s;e that did belong to <HI>that</HI> Church; unle&s;s there were &s;ome apparent rea&s;on to the contrary.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="57" REF="002594_0060_0FDB7E60BAD82DB0">2. THAT there is no Intimation in this Epi&s;tle, that it was to be delivered to an <HI>A&s;&s;embly of Bi&s;hops</HI> convened at <HI>Phi|lippi;</HI> that therefore there is no Ground for &s;uch a Suppo&s;i|tion, but it is a <HI>mere Gue&s;s</HI> to &s;erve a Cau&s;e that needs &s;uch Helps.</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT it is a <HI>Gue&s;s</HI> not only without Foundation, but again&s;t the expre&s;s words of the Epi&s;tle it &s;elf. For the A|po&s;tle calls tho&s;e whom he wrote it to, <HI>Philippians.</HI> Chap. 4.15. <HI>Ye Philippians know al&s;o,</HI> &amp;c. Now it would be very ab&s;urd to call an <HI>A&s;&s;embly of Bi&s;hops,</HI> met together from the neighbouring Cities, <HI>Philippians,</HI> only becau&s;e they happened to hold a meeting at <HI>Philippi.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 OUR <HI>Author</HI>'s Gue&s;s cannot be right, nor yet the Hypo|the&s;is which it is de&s;igned to &s;erve, becau&s;e the Apo&s;tle takes no notice of any <HI>middle Order</HI> in his <HI>Salutations.</HI> For had there at that day been <HI>three Orders of Officers</HI> in the Church, and had there been &s;uch a convention of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of the neighbouring Cities at <HI>Philippi,</HI> it can't be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Deacons who are the <HI>lowe&s;t Order</HI> would have been pre&s;ent, and the <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> who are <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to them, not &s;o. And if the Presbyters had been pre&s;ent, certainly the Apo&s;tle would not have <HI>&s;aluted</HI> their <HI>Inferiors,</HI> without taking any notice at all of <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, If a bad <HI>Gue&s;s</HI> won't de&s;troy the Argument foun|ded on this Text, perhaps a forced Con&s;truction may do the bu&s;ine&s;s better; for our <HI>Author</HI> &s;ays, &s;econdly, <HI>That this Text may mean that</HI> Paul, <HI>and the</HI> Bi&s;hops <HI>&amp;</HI> Deacons <HI>that were with him, &s;alute the &s;aints that are at</HI> Philippi. As if it had run thus. <HI>Paul &amp; Timothy the &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with the Bi&s;hops and Deacons, to all the &s;aints in Christ Je&s;us, which are at Philippi.</HI></P>
<P>I readily agree with our <HI>Author,</HI> that this An&s;wer is <HI>not obvious to every one.</HI> For it is a wonder to me, that <HI>any man,</HI> that hath re'd the two Epi&s;tles of the &s;ame Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Corin|thians,</HI> &s;hould ever make it. In both tho&s;e Epi&s;tles, the <HI>form of Expre&s;&s;ion</HI> u&s;ed in the <HI>Salutation,</HI> is exactly Parallel both in the <HI>Original,</HI> and in <HI>our Tran&s;lation,</HI> to the <HI>form of Expre&s;&s;ion</HI> u&s;ed here. And yet I believe the greate&s;t Zealot for our <HI>Author</HI>'s cau&s;e (when he is not out of temper) will hardly be able to per&s;wade him&s;elf, that the <HI>Salutation,</HI> in the <HI>first</HI> of tho&s;e E|pi&s;tles, ought to run thus; <HI>Paul an Apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, thro' the will of God, and So&s;thenes our Brother, with all that in every place call upon the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord both theirs and ours, unto the Church of God which is at Corinth,</HI> &amp;c. Or that the <HI>true Con&s;truction</HI> of the <HI>Salutation</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d Epi&s;tle is, <HI>Paul
<PB N="58" REF="002594_0061_0FDB7E64EB1A58F8">
an Apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t by the will of God, and Timothy our bro|ther, with all the &s;aints that are in all A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">haia; unto the Church of God which is at Corinth,</HI> &amp;c. I think, I need not mention the rea&s;ons why I &s;uppo&s;e no Body will be ambitious of the Credit of finding out &s;uch a new way of reading the two la&s;t mentioned Salutations. And why the <HI>order</HI> of the <HI>Salu|tation</HI> in the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Philippians</HI> &s;hould be &s;o <HI>inverted,</HI> as it is manife&s;t, the <HI>&s;ame form of Expre&s;&s;ion</HI> ought not to be, in any other place, where it is u&s;ed by the <HI>&s;ame Apo&s;tle</HI> I believe no rea&s;on can be given, but &s;uch an one, as it will be tho't prudence not to expo&s;e.</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Author</HI> hath now done with the Texts of Scripture, from which, he &s;ays, <HI>we allege that the Names of Bi&s;hop &amp; Pre&s;|byter are u&s;ed promi&s;cuou&s;ly.</HI> And upon the whole concludes, that if he &s;hould <HI>grant an Identity of names, yet it will not follow, that there was an Identity of</HI> Offices; <HI>becau&s;e names are common in Scripture, where Offices are acknowleged to be di&s;tinct.</HI> But he &s;hould have remembred, that <HI>&s;omething more</HI> than a bare <HI>Iden|tity of Names</HI> is argued from diver&s;e of the&s;e Texts. And &s;ince he hath been no better able to prove, <HI>that in all the&s;e places we are to under&s;tand Bi&s;hops properly &s;o called, and not Pre&s;byters;</HI> he might have tho't it worth his while, to have endeavoured an an&s;wer to what we argue from the Texts, be&s;ides a <HI>promi&s;cu|ous u&s;e of Names.</HI> For from <HI>Acts</HI> 20 27, 28. we not only prove, that the names of <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> &amp; <HI>Pre&s;byter</HI> are u&s;ed promi&s;cuou&s;ly; but al&s;o that the <HI>Government</HI> of the Church at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> was committed to a <HI>Plurality,</HI> and not to a <HI>&s;ingle Per&s;on;</HI> and that therefore all the&s;e <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> had a power of <HI>Ordination</HI> al&s;o; (&s;ince the Powers of Government and Ordination go together, our Adver&s;aries them&s;elves being Judges) from whence it follows that <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> properly &s;o called have a Right by <HI>Scripture</HI> to all tho&s;e <HI>Powers,</HI> which <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> now claim as pecu|liar to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>AGAIN; From 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, 3.4. &amp;c. We argue that the Apo&s;tle knew of but <HI>two Orders of Officers</HI> in the Church. For it would be <HI>very &s;trange,</HI> when he is &s;o &s;ollicitous, that <HI>Timothy might know how he ought to behave him&s;elf in the Hou&s;e of God;</HI> that yet he &s;hould not give him any account of the <HI>Qualifica|tions</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>one Order of Officers</HI> that belonged to it. And it would be <HI>much &s;tranger &s;till,</HI> that he &s;hould be &s;o <HI>very particular,</HI> in &s;etting down the <HI>Qualifications</HI> of one &s;it for the <HI>Office</HI> of a <HI>Deacon,</HI> which is on all hands, allowed to be the <HI>lowest Order</HI> and yet <HI>omit</HI> all mention of an <HI>Officer</HI> of <HI>higher Degree and more importance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="002594_0062_0FDB7E661130F488">SO again, (to mention no more,) we &s;ay, it appears from <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.1. that there were but but <HI>two orders of Officers</HI> in <HI>that Church.</HI> For it would be no way con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>De|cency</HI> ob&s;erved on all occa&s;ions by the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> to have &s;aluted the <HI>Deacons</HI> by name, and to have taken <HI>no notice</HI> at all of one of the <HI>Orders &s;uperior to them,</HI> if there had been <HI>more than one</HI> that were &s;o. And we &s;ay moreover, that it farther appears from this Text, that the <HI>highe&s;t Order</HI> here mentioned was <HI>&s;uch</HI> as there might be <HI>more than one of,</HI> at the &s;ame time, in the &s;ame Church; and that therefore they could <HI>not</HI> be <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of our Adver&s;aries; for of them there can be <HI>but one</HI> in a Church at once.</P>
<P>THESE things lie <HI>plain</HI> &amp; <HI>obvious</HI> to every Eye in the&s;e Texts, and are much more than a <HI>bare Identity</HI> of <HI>Names;</HI> which is al&s;o demon&s;trable from &s;ome of them, as hath been &s;hewn above. And though our <HI>Author</HI> is plea&s;ed to make light of the <HI>Argument</HI> from the <HI>Identity of Names</HI> to <HI>Identity of Offices,</HI> and many of his brethren have treated it with a great deal of <HI>contempt</HI> and <HI>in&s;ult:</HI> yet, I &s;uppo&s;e, if the matter be <HI>duely weighed,</HI> it will be &s;ound much ea&s;ier to <HI>laugh at</HI> it, than to <HI>an&s;wer</HI> it</P>
<P>INDEED it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that <HI>all&punc;</HI> the <HI>Names</HI> of the <HI>Offices</HI> of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Church,</HI> admit of a <HI>twofold acceptation:</HI> being &s;ometimes u&s;ed in a <HI>common,</HI> and &s;ometimes in an <HI>ap|propriate &s;en&s;e,</HI> by the &s;acred Writers. Thus for in&s;tance; <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> &s;ometimes &s;ignifies <HI>any Me&s;&s;enger,</HI> and &s;ometimes it is more &s;trictly taken for <HI>one of the Twelve,</HI> immediately &s;ent forth by our Lord. So <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> in its <HI>common</HI> acceptation, &s;ignifies an <HI>Over&s;eer,</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byter</HI> &s;ignifies an <HI>old man;</HI> but they are both of them often u&s;ed in a more <HI>appropriate &s;en&s;e,</HI> to denote tho&s;e <HI>Officers,</HI> to whom the <HI>In&s;truction</HI> &amp; <HI>Government</HI> of the Churches were committed. So again, <HI>Deacon,</HI> in its <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> intends any <HI>&s;ervant</HI> or <HI>mini&s;ter:</HI> but in its <HI>stricter u&s;e</HI> is <HI>appropriated</HI> to <HI>that Officer,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to <HI>&s;erve Tables.</HI> And it is generally ea&s;y enough to di&s;cern from the &s;en&s;e, when the&s;e words are to be taken for the <HI>proper Names</HI> of the Offi|cers &s;ometimes denoted by them; and when they are to be taken in the <HI>common &s;en&s;e,</HI> only to intend <HI>&s;omething</HI> that may be <HI>as well</HI> expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>them,</HI> as by any <HI>other words</HI> of the like &s;ignification.</P>
<P>NOW this Ob&s;ervation ea&s;ily accounts for the <HI>difficulty,</HI> objected by our <HI>Author, that the</HI> Apo&s;tle <HI>&amp;</HI> Pa&s;tors <HI>are fre|quently called</HI> Deacons; Upon which he truly &s;ays, <HI>That it
<PB N="60" REF="002594_0063_0FDB7E676A5802F8">
cannot thence be argued, that the</HI> Apo&s;tles <HI>&amp;</HI> Presbyter's <HI>Office was one and the &s;ame with the</HI> Deacon's. The rea&s;on of which is, that the word <HI>Deacon</HI> in tho&s;e Places is u&s;ed in its <HI>common &s;en&s;e,</HI> according to the <HI>original &s;ignification</HI> of it, before it was appropriated, as a <HI>name of di&s;tinction,</HI> to any <HI>particular Order of Officers</HI> in the Church. And this our Tran&s;lators were a|ware of; and accordingly, as the &s;en&s;e directed them, have very well rendred it <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> in tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding this, it is certain (as hath already been ob&s;erved) that <HI>this,</HI> and the <HI>other names</HI> of the <HI>Offices</HI> in the Chri&s;tian Church, are often u&s;ed in the New Te&s;tament, in a more <HI>&s;trict</HI> &amp; <HI>appropriate</HI> &s;en&s;e, to denote certain Offices, which by the&s;e names were di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other. For common &s;en&s;e will teach us that there mu&s;t be (at lea&s;t) as many <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing names,</HI> as there were <HI>di&s;tinct Offices</HI> in the Church; and that <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> of <HI>names</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>as early</HI> as the <HI>di&s;|tinction of Offices:</HI> otherwi&s;e Chri&s;tians mu&s;t have been unable for &s;ome time, to expre&s;s them&s;elves in &s;ome Ca&s;es, either in Conver&s;ation, or in Writing, without an unintelligible Am|biguity. Unle&s;s therefore our <HI>Author</HI> can prove, that the <HI>Scripture Offices</HI> were not di&s;tingui&s;hed in the <HI>Apostles days,</HI> by the <HI>names</HI> given them in <HI>Scripture;</HI> but by &s;ome <HI>other names,</HI> be&s;t known to him&s;elf, and not to be met with <HI>there;</HI> he mu&s;t allow us to conclude, that wherever we meet with the&s;e <HI>names,</HI> evidently u&s;ed in a <HI>&s;trict appropriate &s;en&s;e,</HI> there we are to under&s;tand <HI>certain Officers,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed by the&s;e <HI>names</HI> from <HI>Officers</HI> of <HI>any other Order,</HI> and that could <HI>not</HI> be <HI>distingui&s;hed</HI> from <HI>other Orders,</HI> either in <HI>&s;peaking</HI> or <HI>writing,</HI> without the&s;e <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing names,</HI> which cu&s;tom had <HI>appropriated</HI> to them.</P>
<P>AND &s;till further, where we find two of the&s;e names (tho' evidently u&s;ed in a <HI>&s;trict &s;en&s;e,</HI> yet) <HI>indifferently</HI> applied to the <HI>&s;ame Office,</HI> and <HI>never</HI> find them applied to <HI>any other Office,</HI> or <HI>any other names</HI> applied to <HI>that Office</HI> in an <HI>appropriate &s;en&s;e;</HI> there we mu&s;t be allowed to conclude, that <HI>both</HI> the&s;e were <HI>names,</HI> which cu&s;tom had given to <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>&s;ame Office;</HI> and that it was well enough known at <HI>that time</HI> from all <HI>other Of|fices</HI> by <HI>either</HI> of the&s;e <HI>names.</HI></P>
<P>NOW this is exactly the Ca&s;e, with re&s;pect to the <HI>names, Pre&s;byter</HI> &amp; <HI>Bi&s;hop.</HI> For where they are u&s;ed in the mo&s;t <HI>&s;trict appropriate &s;en&s;e</HI> that can be, we find them <HI>both</HI> applied <HI>indif|ferently</HI> to the <HI>Order of Officers,</HI> unto whom the <HI>In&s;truction</HI> &amp; <HI>Go|vernment</HI> of the Church was committed. And we <HI>never</HI> find <HI>either</HI> of them applied, in a <HI>&s;trict &amp; proper &s;en&s;e,</HI> to any <HI>other
<PB N="61" REF="002594_0064_0FDB7E68B88E64C0">
Order.</HI> Nor do we find the <HI>name Deacon,</HI> ever applied to <HI>this Order,</HI> but where it is <HI>manife&s;tly</HI> u&s;ed in the <HI>common,</HI> and not in the <HI>appropriate &s;en&s;e</HI> of the word. And therefore we very ju&s;tly conclude, that not <HI>two,</HI> but <HI>one</HI> and <HI>the &s;ame</HI> Office, is intended by <HI>both</HI> the&s;e <HI>names;</HI> and that <HI>this Office</HI> was &s;uffi|ciently di&s;tingui&s;hed in the <HI>Apostles time,</HI> by <HI>either</HI> of them.</P>
<P>FOR it would be the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable thing in the world, to imagine, that there could be <HI>two di&s;tinct Offices,</HI> to which the&s;e <HI>names</HI> belonged, and yet the <HI>names</HI> be certainly u&s;ed <HI>pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly;</HI> and never <HI>&s;o</HI> u&s;ed, as that any <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> of <HI>Offices</HI> can be collected from them; nor <HI>any other names</HI> given us by the &s;acred writers, to <HI>distingui&s;h the&s;e Offices</HI> by&punc; not the <HI>names</HI> of <HI>any other Office</HI> given in an <HI>appropriate &s;en&s;e,</HI> to the <HI>Office,</HI> to which <HI>the&s;e two names</HI> are, in <HI>&s;uch a &s;en&s;e</HI> promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly applyed; nor la&s;tly, either of <HI>the&s;e names</HI> ever given, in an <HI>appropriate &s;en&s;e,</HI> to any <HI>other Office,</HI> but that of <HI>in&s;tructing</HI> &amp; <HI>governing</HI> the Church.</P>
<P>BUT if we &s;hould let all this go for nothing, and take our <HI>Author</HI>'s own Account of the matter, it will be found to make <HI>&s;trongly for our Opinion.</HI> For after he hath told us, <HI>that the Apo&s;tles &amp; Pastors are frequently called</HI> Deacons; and yet that <HI>it cannot thence be argued, that the Apo&s;tle</HI>'s <HI>&amp; Pre&s;byter's Office was one &amp; the &s;ame with the Deacon</HI>'s: the rea&s;on he gives for it is, <HI>That the name of the</HI> Genus <HI>is u&s;ually given to the &s;pecies; the &s;uperior Office including the inferior. All</HI> Apo&s;tles <HI>were</HI> Pre&s;|byters &amp; Deacons: <HI>tho' not</HI> vice ver&s;a; that is, tho' all <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> &amp; <HI>Deacons</HI> were not <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> So that according to him a <HI>&s;uperior Office</HI> might be called by the name of an <HI>inferior:</HI> but an <HI>inferior Office</HI> might not be called by the name of a <HI>&s;uperior,</HI> If therefore we can find the &s;ame per&s;ons, that are called <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> (and that <HI>certainly</HI> were <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> in <HI>fact</HI> as well as <HI>name</HI>) immediately after called <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> it will fol|low, from our <HI>Author</HI>'s own way of rea&s;oning, that <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> were not an <HI>order &s;uperior</HI> to <HI>Pre&s;byters.</HI> Now for an In&s;tance of this, I will only refer him to the above mentioned, <HI>Acts</HI> 20. where tho&s;e that are called <HI>Elders</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> ver. 17.

<P><PB N="63" REF="002594_0066_0FDB7E6BB46E87F8">UNTO the&s;e, may be added two Arguments further. As (1.) It is not likely that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord (who always paid and taught &s;uch a Reverence to the Civil Magi&s;trate, &s;hou'd at once brand all the <HI>Kings</HI> &amp; <HI>Governors</HI> in the Gentile World, as a Crew of <HI>Tyrants</HI> &amp; <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ors,</HI> without any Exception or Di&s;tinction.

'Twas briefly this; The Mother of <HI>Zebedee</HI>'s Children came with her Sons to our <HI>Lord,</HI> wor&s;hipping him, and de&s;iring a certain Favour of him, viz. That <HI>her two Sons might &s;it, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left hand in his Kingdom</HI> Now We cannot rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, This Woman had any thing in View but a <HI>ju&s;t Dominion;</HI> not Tyranny &amp; Oppre&s;&s;ion; but barely Power &amp; Authority: which, no doubt, &s;he hop'd her Sons wou'd manage worthily &mdash; However, our Lord &s;ees fit to reject her De&s;ire; and takes occa&s;ion not only to forbid his Apo&s;tles the tyrannical and corrupt exerci&s;e of Au|thority, but even all <HI>Principality</HI> &amp; <HI>Dominion</HI> it &s;elf, among them&s;elves. And as <HI>Junius</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tom.</HI> 2. <HI>Contra</HI> Bellarm.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, <HI>In&s;tead of the Dominion de&s;ired, he enjoyne them a humble Mini&s;try &amp; Service.</HI> And whereas it had been objected by <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> That <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> are not here forbidden to exerci&s;e a Dominion like that of <HI>godly</HI> Kings, but only like that of <HI>tyrannical</HI> Kings, who know not GOD: <HI>Junius</HI> replies, <HI>We deny that there is any &s;uch Re&s;triction, neither can it be proved.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="002594_0067_0FDB7E7285DF4BC0">THIS might &s;uffice: but &s;ince our <HI>Author</HI> has taken a pretty deal of pains in making critical Remarks on the Text, to expound it out of our Service, if po&s;&s;ible; I &s;hall do him the Ju&s;tice, particularly to examine all he has &s;aid.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t then, HE ob&s;erves, <HI>That it</HI>'s <HI>only a</HI> Secular <HI>Dominion, that our Lord forbids,</HI> &amp;c. Where, by the way, He &s;eems to <HI>retract</HI> what he had &s;aid ju&s;t before, when he <HI>deny'd</HI> any other Dominion to be condemned, but <HI>only that which is exerci&s;ed with imperious Bitterne&s;s.</HI> He has done well to correct him&s;elf, as he &s;eems to do, when he here interprets it of <HI>&s;ecular</HI> Domi|nion; which being mention'd without any Limitation or Qualification, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e him to allow it forbidden to the Apo&s;tles <HI>intirely,</HI> whether <HI>exerci&s;ed with Bitterne&s;s</HI> or not.

He only argues from the <HI>greater</HI> to the <HI>le&s;s:</HI> As if he had &s;aid, If <HI>I,</HI> who am your <HI>&s;upreme Lord,</HI> have &s;toop'd to mini&s;ter unto <HI>you,</HI>

<P>HE argues from the 70, who have been long ago <HI>di&s;charg'd;</HI> and Evidence brought, that CHRIST left them not in Com|mi&s;&s;ion at his A&s;cen&s;ion: or however, that they were not a <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> Order from the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>BUT if none of the former <HI>Objections</HI> will bear, He has another in Store&mdash;</P>
<P N="5">5.

<P>BUT to this the An&s;wer is ea&s;y.

<P>IT might be added, (as I find a Learned Man <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ander&s;.</HI> Def. pa. 84.</NOTE> ob&s;erving) that our Lord did <HI>not</HI> &s;tate the oppo&s;ition 'twixt Them, and the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts, becau&s;e the Di&s;ciples did not as yet think of any other Church-Government than what at pre&s;ent obtain|ed among the <HI>Jews,</HI> and CHRIST did not find them ripe for receiving any Intimation thereof; but tho't it enough to give

them a <HI>general Rule</HI> to be ob&s;erved by them afterwards, which (when it was to be put in practice) they wou'd ea&s;ily con|ceive the meaning of, after <HI>their Understandings were opened,</HI> and <HI>all Things brought to their Remembrance</HI> by the Holy Gho&s;t.

<P>THUS I have (I hope) remov'd all that our <HI>Author</HI> has offer'd to invalidate our Objection again&s;t <HI>Prelacy</HI> from our Savior's Rule in <HI>Mat.</HI> 20.25, 26.&mdash; And have vindicated the <HI>Parallel Places</HI> therewith.</P>
<P>YET I wou'd take particular Notice of the la&s;t Text our <HI>Author</HI> mentions, that is, 1 Pet. 5.2, 3. <HI>Feed the Flock of God, which is among you, taking the over&s;ight thereof</HI> (or acting as Bi&s;hops over it,) <HI>not by con&s;traint, but willingly, not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready mind: neither as being Lords over God's Heritage, but being En&s;amples to the Flock.</HI> He brings in this, as a <HI>parallel place,</HI> but I do not remember at pre&s;ent, that I have known it to be improv'd by any of our Per&s;uation, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e with the other Texts: So that it &s;eems <HI>not fair &amp; ingenuous Dealing in him</HI> to mention it as &s;o alledged. However &s;ince it falls in my way, I will ob&s;erve upon it, with our <HI>Author,</HI> That <HI>Lording over GOD's Heritage</HI> is here expre&s;ly di&s;charg'd or forbidden.

CHRIST will have no &s;uch Government, either of Mini&s;ters over Mini&s;ters, or of Mini&s;ters over their Flocks: The A|po&s;tle di&s;claim'd it, 2 Cor. 1.24. <HI>Not for that we have Dominion over your Faith, but are Helpers of your Joy.</HI> So, 1 Cor. 3 5. <HI>Who is</HI> Paul? <HI>And Who</HI> is Apollos? <HI>But</HI> Mini&s;ters, <HI>by whom ye believed!</HI> 2 Cor. 4.5. <HI>We preach not our &s;elves, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us the</HI> LORD, <HI>and our &s;elves your</HI> SERVANTS <HI>for Je&s;us &s;ake.</HI>

<Q>Hence (as Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> ob&s;erves <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes on <HI>Mat.</HI> 20.25.</NOTE>) are they &s;o often &s;tiled <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> and their Work a <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> to the Saints: And therefore, &s;aith he, All the Office any man can have in the Kingdom of CHRIST, can only be a larger <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> to others.

<P>IN the 3d and la&s;t place, He comes to con&s;ider a Text brought for <HI>Pre&s;byterian Ordination,</HI> viz. That of the Apo&s;tle,

1 Tim. 4.14. <HI>Neglect not the Gift&mdash; which was given Thee &mdash; with the Laying on of the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery.</HI> We judge it evident from this Place, That <HI>Pre&s;byters have a Right &amp; Power to ordain Pre&s;byters.</HI> And I think, nothing he has &s;aid do's at all di&s;prove it. As for <HI>Jerom</HI>'s acknowlegement, that Ordination belongs, if not <HI>&s;olely,</HI> yet <HI>chiefly,</HI> to <HI>Bi&s;hops;</HI> this don't at all move me: becau&s;e it is well known, that what|ever <HI>Jerom</HI> thought peculiar to <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> he thought to be &s;o, <HI>rather by the Cu&s;tom of the Church, than by Divine Appointment</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Magis Con&s;uetudine, quam di&s;po&s;itionis Dominicae Veritate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <BIBL><HI>Hieron. in Epi&s;. ad Tit. cap. 6.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>.

<P>BUT our <HI>Author</HI> objects, that <HI>if we</HI> &s;hould <HI>grant that the Pre&s;bytery is to be understood here, of the</HI> Meeting <HI>of Pre&s;byters, yet it will not prove, that they had full power &amp; authority to ordain; for here</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>at the mo&s;t they did but concur &amp; a&s;&s;i&s;t in the ordination of</HI> Timothy, <HI>as is evident from</HI> 2 Tim. 1.6. <HI>Where the Apo&s;tle calling on him to &s;tir up that Gift,</HI> &s;ays of it, <HI>which is in Thee, by the Putting on of</HI> MY <HI>Hands.</HI></P>
<P>TO which I an&s;wer; If we take this to refer to <HI>Timothy</HI>'s <HI>Or|dination</HI> (which is que&s;tioned by many) altho' it appears from hence, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>laid on hands,</HI> as well as the A&s;&s;embly or Council of <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy:</HI> yet that gives us no more grounds to &s;u&s;pect, That <HI>the Pre&s;byters had not full power &amp; authority to ordain by them&s;elves,</HI> than it does to &s;u&s;pect whether the <HI>Apo&s;tle had power to ordain by him&s;elf.</HI> For the Apo&s;tle plainly attributes as much to <HI>the laying on of the hands of the Pre&s;bytery,</HI> in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Epi&s;tle, as he does to <HI>the putting on of his own hands,</HI> in the <HI>other;</HI> which it would

be very unrea&s;onable for him to do, if the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> had not had the <HI>&s;ame power</HI> with <HI>him&s;elf</HI> in <HI>that</HI> Ca&s;e.

<P>BUT the truth of the Ca&s;e is, (as hath been, I hope, abun|dantly proved, in the preceding pages) that <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> &amp; <HI>Pre&s;by|ters</HI> are one and the &s;ame <HI>Order</HI> by <HI>Divine In&s;titution;</HI> and that they &s;ucceed the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> in all their <HI>ordinary</HI> Powers, of which that of <HI>Ordination</HI> is one; which is warrant enough for <HI>Ordination</HI> by Presbyters, and the very &s;ame warrant which <HI>tho&s;e</HI> have for it, who are now, by <HI>Custom,</HI> and <HI>humane Consti|tutions,</HI> dignified and di&s;tingui&s;hed with the Title of <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI> But if our <HI>Author</HI> mu&s;t have a <HI>precedent</HI> as well as a <HI>warrant</HI> for Ordination by Presbyters, and &s;uch a <HI>Praecedent</HI> too as no <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> was concerned in; I might with as good rea&s;on in|&s;i&s;t upon his giving an <HI>In&s;tance</HI> of &s;uch an <HI>Ordination,</HI> by any per&s;on, or per&s;ons that are any where called <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI> How|ever, if he will plea&s;e to read <HI>Acts</HI> 13. <HI>begin&punc;</HI> and then con|&s;ider what he him&s;elf under&s;tands by <HI>Prophets &amp; Teachers,</HI> (pag. 36, 38.) and what he takes to be the de&s;ign of <HI>prayer &amp; Impo&s;ition of hands</HI> (pa. 12.)

But methinks, this admits of an ea&s;y An&s;wer. For what need is there of an expre&s;s Repeal or formal Inhibition, where the Rea&s;on of the Thing cea&s;eth, as is apparently the Ca&s;e before us!

<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 62. OUR <HI>Author</HI> argues again&s;t the Presbyterian Principle, from <HI>its dangerous Con&s;equence to Religion,</HI> as if it <HI>open'd a Gap to all Errors,</HI> and led to the Subver&s;ion of the whole Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try.&mdash; This, I &s;uppo&s;e, he might think wou'd give us an alarm, and make us look to our &s;elves, and beware how we attempt to &s;hake Epi&s;copacy, le&s;t <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> &s;hou'd unhappily fall with it. But I &s;ee no Cau&s;e for &s;uch a Fear.

<P><HI>AND now having fini&s;h'd what I de&s;ign'd,</HI> that is, having &s;hown the Weakne&s;s of our <HI>Author</HI>'s &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Demon&s;trations,</HI> and the Incon&s;i&s;tency of <HI>his</HI> Account with the <HI>Scripture-account of the&s;e matters; I &s;hall only add, by way of Conclu&s;ion,</HI> &s;ome of his own <HI>Expo&s;tulations</HI> (with a little alteration, turned upon him&s;elf and tho&s;e of his per&s;ua&s;ion) <HI>in the Spirit of meekne&s;s &amp; Love; and calmly inquire</HI> (with him) <HI>what is the ground of all that Noi&s;e &amp; Clamour, Hatred &amp; Prejudice, rai&s;ed again&s;t them who are of the principles, as to the Point of Church-Government, which</HI> I have been defending?</P>
<P><HI>'TIS evident we own</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>to be</HI> &s;ole <HI>Lord &amp; Law|giver to his Church; that he hath Power to e&s;tabli&s;h Order &amp; Govern|ment therein, and to in&s;titute what Offices he plea&s;eth in his &s;piritual

Kingdom.</HI> The&s;e are the Things we earne&s;tly contend for.</P>
<P><HI>WE are fully per&s;uaded, that He, who is of infinite Wi&s;dom &amp; Goodne&s;s, hath di&s;po&s;ed all Affairs relating to the Government of his Church, in the mo&s;t excellent Method, to promote the Edification &amp; Salvation of his People.</HI> And therefore we cannot con&s;ent, that the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Men &s;hould intermeddle and alter the Con&s;titutions of Divine Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><HI>WE plainly find</HI> but one Order of <HI>Officers,</HI> the Eleven <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> left in the Church by CHRIST him&s;elf at his A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven: and one Order more, <HI>the &s;even Deacons,</HI> in&s;tituted afterwards by the Apo&s;tles under the Conduct of the Spirit of GOD. <HI>The&s;e</HI> two <HI>Orders are unquestionably of Divine In&s;titu|tion;</HI> but more we cannot find to be &s;o. We de&s;ire to pre|&s;erve to each of the&s;e, all the <HI>ordinary Powers</HI> they were en|tru&s;ted with by Divine Appointment; and not to thru&s;t either of them into Employments, which the wi&s;dom of GOD never allotted to them. We are far from &s;aying that either of the&s;e Offices was <HI>temporary.</HI> We only affirm, that the for|mer of them had &s;ome Powers at the beginning, which were <HI>extraordinary</HI> &amp; <HI>temporary,</HI> and expired with the Per&s;ons they were committed to: but that as to their ordinary Powers, they have been, and &s;hall be &s;ucceeded, to the <HI>end of the World,</HI> by <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> whom we every where find in Scrip|ture to be one and the &s;ame Order.</P>
<P><HI>AND now let any impartially judge, who do mo&s;t truly a&s;&s;ert Chri&s;t's Kingly Office, and the Prerogatives of his Crown: WE, who plead for his In&s;titution, and clo&s;ely adhere thereunto, and to the Offices which he hath appointed in his Church;</HI> without increa|&s;ing their Number, or adding to, or taking any thing away from, the <HI>ordinary Powers,</HI> he committed to either of them. <HI>Or</HI> THEY, <HI>who make bold with his In&s;titution,</HI> to alter it as they plea&s;e: who have &s;et up more Offices in the Church, than were appointed by CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles; who call upon tho&s;e to preach &amp; bapti&s;e, who&s;e only Bu&s;ine&s;s, by Divine Appointment, is to &s;erve Tables: and who have <HI>ca&s;hier'd</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Auth.</HI> pag. 40.</NOTE> in a great mea&s;ure <HI>CHRIST</HI>'s <HI>prime Officers &amp; Repre&s;entatives, and the Churches principal Guides, and have depriv'd the Church</HI> very much of the Benefit of the&s;e <HI>Pledges of her Lord's Care and Kindne&s;s,</HI> the Pa&s;tors &amp; Teachers, <HI>which he gave her, when he a&s;cen|ded up to Heaven:</HI> who have intirely wre&s;ted the Power of Go|vernment, and wou'd take that of Ordination al&s;o, out of the
