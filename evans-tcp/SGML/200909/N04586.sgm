for Pardon, Peace and Happine&s;s, the Fa|brick will &s;urely fall, <HI>(debile Fundamentum fallit opus.)</HI> I have endeavoured to open this grand Article of Religion in the plaine&s;t Manner I could, that &s;o the weake&s;t Minds may have ju&s;t Conceptions of it.</P>
<P>The Light in which I have &s;et this Point, is agreeable to the Series of &s;acred Scripture, and the harmonious Suffrage of the reformed Churches of <HI>Scotland, Holland, France, Geneva, England, Germany,</HI> &amp;c. expre&s;s'd in their Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith; which altho' licentious Wits, who are di&s;po&s;ed to be as loo&s;e and incon&s;i&s;tent in their <HI>Sentiments</HI> as <HI>Morals,</HI> may deride and burle&s;que as &s;lavi&s;h Sy&s;tems beneath their Notice, will notwith|&s;tanding be e&s;teemed by the Sober and Judicious, as in&s;tructive and valuable <HI>Summaries</HI> of divine Truth, &s;o long as there be any Remains of true Religion in the&s;e Nations!</P>
<P>Its affecting to think how Mankind are inclin'd to run from one extreme to another. Some who have left the Principles of <HI>Armi|nius,</HI> not thorowly under&s;tanding the Doc|trines

<P>Now as Vertue con&s;i&s;ts in a Mediocrity between two Extremes, &s;o do the Doctrines of Religion, and e&s;pecially this of Ju&s;tification, we &s;hould therefore beware, lea&s;t while we labour to &s;hun <HI>Scilla,</HI> we ru&s;h upon <HI>Caribdis.</HI></P>
<P>I had no Intention of publi&s;hing this Di&s;|cour&s;e when I preach'd it, having offered to the Publick a Sermon upon Ju&s;tification &s;ome Years agone, but was induced hereto, by con|&s;idering the Difficulty and Importance of the Subject, and the wrong Notions that many have of it, with de&s;ign to give check to them. I was al&s;o inform'd, that a few of the Hearers were di&s;&s;atisfied, and many more entertain'd with a Method of handling the Subject different from what they had heard; and therefore to remove the unrea&s;onable Cen&s;ures of &s;ome, and &s;atisfy the De&s;ires of others, I con&s;ented to its publication; not

<P>MY Brethren!

As we are not condemn'd actually, on the Account of the Sin of our fir&s;t Parents, until we actual|ly exi&s;t and are united to them naturally, by partaking of a vitiated Nature derived
<PB N="9" REF="005697_0011_1026C1A932999530">
from them: So neither are we actually ju&s;tified by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> until we are &s;piritually united to him as our mi&s;tical Head by Faith <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John i. 12. Rom. v. 19.</NOTE>. But &s;o &s;oon as this Union is obtain'd, an actual Communion in the Benefits of Redemption immediately en&s;ues, among which Ju&s;tifica|tion is a primary and principal one: Of this the Apo&s;tle treats in the Words of our Text. To under&s;tand which let it be con&s;idered, that the Occa&s;ion of writing this Epi&s;tle to the Churches of <HI>Galatia,</HI> (a Country in the <HI>Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia</HI>) was partly to reprove and re|duce &s;ome Members of the&s;e Churches, who had as &s;hamefully as perilou&s;ly Apo&s;|tatiz'd from the important Doctrine of Ju&s;|tification by Faith alone, thro' the corrupt Influence of &s;ome fal&s;e Teachers who crept in among them, and taught the Nece&s;&s;ity of Circumci&s;ion and other Works of the Law, in order to the Ju&s;tification of a Sin|ner before God; and this they did with a political De&s;ign, to &s;crene them&s;elves from that Per&s;ecution which all the Chri&s;tians
<PB N="10" REF="005697_0012_1026C1ABE3607138">
were then expos'd to who were not Cir|cumcis'd; and in order to promote their new and pernicious Doctrine, they pur&s;ued the Method which is common to Hereticks and Seducers in every Age of the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> They made great Shews of Religion, commended them&s;elves, traduc'd and vili|fied the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in&s;inuating that he was no Apo&s;tle, that he had learn'd all he knew, from <HI>James, Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> and yet differ'd from them in Doctrine and Practice, as well as from him&s;elf. Now the Apo&s;tle does not only in this Epi&s;tle labour to re|claim the erring <HI>Galatians,</HI> but likewi&s;e to vindicate his Character from the unju&s;t and invidious Charges of the fal&s;e Teachers: To this purpo&s;e the fir&s;t and &s;econd Chap|ters of this Epi&s;tle are chiefly &s;pent&middot; The in&s;pir'd Writer does therein prove him&s;elf to be a true Apo&s;tle, and not to have learn'd what he taught from <HI>Peter, James</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> but that he had it by Revelation from Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

The moral Law was doubtle&s;s intended by the Apo&s;tle as well as the Ceremonial:
<Q>For it is Manife&s;t, that altho' this Que&s;ti|on about Ju&s;tification by Works began about Circumci&s;ion, and Works done in Obedience to the Ceremonial Law, yet the Determination of it extended farther; for the Apo&s;tle by the Law under&s;tands that Law by which is the Knowledge of Sin <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 20.</NOTE>.

<Q>We <HI>Jews</HI> as well as the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> are in a State of Wrath and Condemnation before Faith, not|with&s;tanding of our Religious Priviledges, which being made &s;en&s;ible of, as well as the utter In&s;ufficiency of any Acts of Obedience we have or can perform, to free us from the Guilt of Sin, and acquire for us a Right to Happine&s;s; and being

per&s;waded of the Safety of entire De|pendence upon the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Mediator for our Acceptance with God, we have con&s;ented to embrace him upon Go&s;pel Terms, and reject all Refuges be|&s;ides him, and that becau&s;e, <HI>by the Works of the Law &s;hall no Fle&s;h be ju&s;tified, i. e.</HI> no mortal Man can rea|&s;onably expect, or ever attain to be de|clar'd Righteous before God, on the Ac|count of his Obedience to the Law of God, becau&s;e of its Imperfection.</Q></P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid it appears, that the Point to be di&s;cours'd upon from this Text, is the Manner of a Sinner's Ju&s;tification before God. It cannot be Ju&s;|tification before Men, or the evidencing of the reality of our faith to them that is here intended; for good Works would not then be wholly rejected, being of princi|pal U&s;e in that Ca&s;e; by tho&s;e, as the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>our Faith is &s;hewn</HI> or di&s;co|ver'd. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jam.</HI> 2.18.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> Its reality is manife&s;ted to others, and evidenc'd to our &s;elves.

hence he concludes <HI>that a Man is ju&s;tified by Works and not by Faith only,</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jam. ii. 24.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> in the &s;ight of Men. High Pretences to and a great Blu&s;ter about Faith and Ex|periences, when the&s;e Things are not crown'd with a holy and humble Conver&s;ation, are ju&s;tly rejected by the Sober and Judici|ous, as In&s;tances of Hypocri&s;y and Delu|&s;ion. That Faith that don't produce good Works is <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>unprofitable,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jam. ii. 14, 17.</NOTE> and therefore cannot be the In&s;trument of our Ju&s;tification before God. What has been &s;aid &s;erves to remove the &s;eeming Contrari|ety between the two Apo&s;tles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James</HI> and &s;hew their Harmony: To which let me add, that they wrote to different Sorts of People, <HI>Paul</HI> directed his Di&s;cour&s;e of Ju&s;tification without Works to <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and &s;uch as were of a Self-righteous Ca&s;t, who depended &s;ecurely upon their Acts of Obedience, and tho't thereby in &s;ome De|gree at lea&s;t to procure the divine Favour: The&s;e ambitious <HI>Babel-builders,</HI> the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> labours to &s;hake from the Summit of
<PB N="15" REF="005697_0017_1026C1B769D0AE70">
their Self-righteou&s;ne&s;s in point of Depen|dence, that &s;o being made <HI>poor in &s;pirit,</HI> they might learn to <HI>&s;ubmit to,</HI> and lean alone upon the Mediator's Righteou&s;ne&s;s for acceptance with God. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 8, 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> had to do with a <HI>Club</HI> of <HI>Libertines,</HI> who made high Pre|tences to Faith and Ju&s;tification by it, while they went on in a Cour&s;e of Impiety in Practice: The&s;e hardy Hypocrites he takes to ta&s;k and &s;hews the Vanity of their Pre|tences, by declaring, that that Faith that ju&s;tified us before God, was a vital active Grace, productive of good Works; and that good Works were nece&s;&s;ary to evidence to the World about us, the Truth of our Faith and the reality of our Ju&s;tification, whatever lawle&s;s Libertines might unju&s;tly mutter again&s;t them notwith&s;tanding! But to return: As it is not Ju&s;tification before Men that is intended in our Text, as ap|pears from what has been &s;aid; &s;o neither is it a Ju&s;tification in the Sight of Con|&s;cience, for good Works are of great U&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="005697_0018_1026C1BA63C5F968">
to evidence thereto the Safety of our State: <HI>Hereby</HI> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle <HI>John) we do know that we know him, if we keep his Command|ments; and he that &s;aith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar and the Truth is not in him</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 3, 4.</NOTE>: (And el&s;ewhere he a&s;&s;ures us) <HI>that if we &s;ay we have Fel|low&s;hip with him and walk in darkne&s;s, we lie and do not the Truth; but if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have Fellow&s;hip one with another</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John i. 6, 7</NOTE>: <HI>i. e.</HI> If we go on in a Cour&s;e of Holine&s;s, which is here call'd Light, we have an Evidence of true Communion with God, which is a Fruit of Reconciliation to him.</P>
<P>It remains therefore, that it is Ju&s;tificati|on before God only, that the Apo&s;tle treats of in our Text, and a&s;&s;erts <HI>to be by Faith without the Works of the Law.</HI> This be|ing the Sub&s;tance and Scope of the Text, I &s;hall in order to prepare it for Improvement, &s;peak upon the two following Heads, <HI>viz:</HI>

<P>From all which Con&s;iderations complex|ly con&s;idered, it appears that the Obedience of Chri&s;t was of infinite Value, and there|fore an equivalent Satisfaction to Ju&s;tice for the Sins of tho&s;e he repre&s;ented: And &s;eeing that the active and pa&s;&s;ive Obedience of Chri&s;t, was not due from him to the Law, con&s;idered as <HI>God-Man,</HI> it might be therefore imputed to others.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e this Point of the <HI>Satisfac|tion</HI> of Chri&s;t, is of infinite Moment in the Chri&s;tian Religion, I wou'd therefore offer the following Hints before I proceed far|ther, in Confirmation and Illu&s;tration of it.</P>
<P>Natural Rea&s;on in&s;tructs us that there is a God, from whom all Things are deriv'd, and by whom they are govern'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="005697_0043_1026C1FD80A82AC8">This &s;upreme Being having made intel|ligent Creatures capable of moral Homage, it was but rea&s;onable that he &s;hould give them a Law to direct them in it, e&s;peci|ally &s;eeing they cou'd not know &s;uch Pre|cepts as took their Ri&s;e from his ab&s;olute So|vereignty, (which de&s;erves Honour, as well as his other Attributes) without &s;ome Inti|mations from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A Law being given, it's highly rea&s;onable that Obedience to it &s;hould be enforc'd by Penalties equal to the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions thereof.</P>
<P>Now &s;eeing by every Violation of the Law, the infinite Maje&s;ty of the Legi&s;la|tor is affronted, and infinite Obligations to &s;erve him, which the Creature is laid un|der, by rea&s;on of the e&s;&s;ential Excellency and communicative Goodne&s;s of God are broken, therefore an infinite Guilt is con|tracted by every Sin.</P>
<P>This Guilt, the Judge and Legi&s;lator, becau&s;e of his natural Holine&s;s, his govern|ing Wi&s;dom, Truth and Ju&s;tice, cannot pa&s;s by without an equal Satisfaction.</P>
<P>But this the Sinner cannot perform, be|cau&s;e he is finite, and therefore either he
<PB N="42" REF="005697_0044_1026C1FF0856A0D8">
mu&s;t &s;uffer eternally, or a Surety under|take for him, and do and &s;uffer in his Room and Place, what he was and is uncapable of.</P>
<P>Now the Per&s;on that &s;o interpo&s;es mu&s;t be <HI>Man,</HI> that he might be capable of &s;uf|fering, for the Deity is impa&s;&s;ible; and it is but ju&s;t and rea&s;onable that the Nature that &s;inn'd &s;hou'd &s;uffer, that the Sin of Man &s;hould be puni&s;h'd in Man.</P>
<P>And indeed it is as nece&s;&s;ary, that the Per&s;on interpo&s;ing be <HI>God,</HI> that &s;o the human Nature &s;hou'd be Supported under its Sufferings, which being equal to the Demerit of Sin, and con&s;equently infinite, wou'd otherways de&s;troy it.

This leads me to the</P>
<P N="2">II. General Head, which was to prove, <HI>that Ju&s;tification is without the Works of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>Now this is not only expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted in the Words of our Text, but likewi&s;e in other Places of Scripture: <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 28. Rom. v. 1. Rom. iii. 20. Gal. iii. 11, 24.</NOTE> To which let me add the following Arguments, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

Law, but not under the Go&s;pel; for the <HI>Relaxation</HI> made under the Go&s;pel is not that an imperfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hou'd be accepted for a perfect one; for thus the Ju&s;tice of God would be wrong'd: Neither is it con&s;i&s;tent with the Truth of God to declare tho&s;e Righteous, that are not per|fectly &s;o, either <HI>inherently</HI> or by <HI>Imputation.</HI> But the <HI>Relaxation</HI> made under the Go&s;pel, con&s;i&s;ts in accepting of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Surety, in the Room of that which the Law required of the Sinner per&s;onally.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> We have broken the Law, and cannot make Reparation equal to the Of|fence, and le&s;s than this, divine Ju&s;tice will not accept. Our after Obedience, upon the Suppo&s;ition it was perfect, (which in the mean time cannot be rea&s;onably expected from imperfect Creatures) wou'd not make Satisfaction for our pa&s;t Di&s;obedience; the Rea&s;on of which is this: We are under a double Debt to God, <HI>viz.</HI> Of <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Penalty;</HI> as <HI>Creatures,</HI> we owe the former to God's <HI>Law,</HI> and as <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors</HI> we owe the latter to his <HI>Ju&s;tice;</HI> now the Payment of the one, cannot di&s;charge the other,

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We can't be ju&s;tify'd by Works, becau&s;e that Works done before Faith are not plea&s;ing to God, but full of Sin; and &s;o &s;oon as Faith is given, it immediately re|ceives Chri&s;t, and &s;o we are Ju&s;tified be|fore we perform Works that are &s;piritually Good. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 7, 8.</NOTE> And hence the Almighty is &s;aid <HI>to Ju&s;tify the Ungodly:</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 5.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> Such as have never done any acceptable Service to God.

<P>A JUST View of the Harmony that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the Law and Go&s;|pel, is of great Importance in the Chri&s;tian Religion: To promote this, is therefore the De&s;ign of our pre&s;ent Meditations, to which the Text I have cho&s;en directly leads.</P>

or with great abhorrence! <HI>Do we then make void the Law by Faith?</HI> The Objection more fully Stated is this:

It is therefore the De&s;truction of the Moral Law as a <HI>Rule</HI> of Life, or its Obligation to Obedience under that Cha|racter, which the Apo&s;tle oppo&s;es.</P>
<P>To make this the more ea&s;y to be un|der&s;tood, let it be con&s;idered, that a Law in general may be thus de&s;crib'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is a Rule of Duty, or of Things to be done and avoided, pre&s;crib'd by the Almighty, and enforced by the Threatning of Puni&s;hment upon the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or.</P>

<P>This Law does virtually contain in it an Obligation to believe and obey what God &s;hould afterwards reveal and enjoin, and therefore all <HI>po&s;itive Precepts</HI> of a Divine Original were and are e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the Moral Law, during the Time appointed for their Continuance.</P>

<P>To what has been &s;aid we may add, the divine Injunction, that the People mu&s;t prepare them&s;elves to hear the LAW; they were to <HI>&s;anctify them&s;elves and wa&s;h their Cloaths:</HI> Now tho' this was a cere|monious U&s;age peculiar to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Oe|conomy, yet doubtle&s;s the Sanctification of the Heart was thereby &s;ignified.

<P><HI>Thirdly:</HI> Jehovah's <HI>repairing</HI> the <HI>Tables</HI> after they were broken, is an additional Argument for the <HI>Dignity</HI> of the <HI>Law:</HI> Jehovah <HI>commanded</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>to hew two Tables of Stone like unto the Fir&s;t,</HI> and promis'd <HI>that he wou'd write upon them the Words which were in the fir&s;t Tables, that</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>broke:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ex. xxxiv. 1.</NOTE> Here it is evident, that the writ|ing upon the &s;econd Tables, was done im|mediately by God him&s;elf, like that of the Fir&s;t.</P>

when they left that Part of the World but drove them away with the Ve&s;&s;els in ha&s;te; neither was the other Precept to <HI>Abraham ab&s;olute,</HI> but only a Command of Tryal.</P>
<P>But to proceed. The <HI>Matter</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> is <HI>Good,</HI> not only in re&s;pect of it's <HI>Precepts</HI> but <HI>Sanctions.</HI> It is accompany'd with Promi&s;es both of &s;piritual and temporal Good, as appears from the &s;econd and fourth Commands: It was therefore wicked in the <HI>heretical Manichees</HI> (who infe&s;ted the Church about the fourth Century, whom ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> faithfully oppos'd) to &s;ay that the Law was only Carnal, and had only carnal Promi&s;es; whereas it is certain that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church had for Sub&s;tance the &s;ame Faith, which we now, thro' divine Goodne&s;s, enjoy. And the <HI>Threatnings</HI> annex'd to the Moral Law are Ju&s;t, and therefore Good.</P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Law</HI> is <HI>Good</HI> in regard of it's <HI>U&s;e.</HI> Now the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> is either <HI>general</HI> to all Men or <HI>particular</HI> to &s;ome. And,</P>

<P>The <HI>Moral Law</HI> is a Declaration of God's Will to Mankind, re&s;pecting their Duty to him and each other, obliging them to per&s;onal, perfect and perpetual Obedi|ence.</P>
<P>As we are <HI>Creatures</HI> we are <HI>Subjects,</HI> he who gave us Being has a Right to demand Obedience from us, to what he pre&s;cribes.</P>
<P>And tho' we have made our&s;elves un|able to perform perfect per&s;onal O|bedience to the Law, yet God's Right to it remains firm; our Sin cannot le&s;&s;en that: And tho' Provi&s;ion is made through Chri&s;t for the Ju&s;tification of our Per&s;ons upon believing, and the Acceptance of our &s;in|cere,

tho' imperfect, Services thro' him; yet are we bound by the Law as a Rule to &s;eek after a Perfection of Holine&s;s in our own Per&s;ons, and to lament from Love our Defects. The De&s;ign of Chri&s;t's coming into the World was to &s;trengthen the Obligation of the Law as a Rule, by Arguments of Ingenuity and Gratitude in|&s;tead of di&s;&s;olving it. Here ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the <HI>Law informs</HI> all Men of the Holy <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and their <HI>Duty</HI> to him: The divine <HI>Perfections</HI> are impre&s;s'd on the <HI>Moral Law</HI> in large, legible and in|delible <HI>Characters;</HI> his <HI>Sovereignty</HI> in de|manding Obedience; his <HI>Wi&s;dom, Holine&s;s</HI> and Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Nature of the Du|ties requir'd, which are rea&s;onable, pure, equal, and his <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> in their U&s;e and Bene|fits to us: What is the Language of the Law, but <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> towards God and <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> towards Man?</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Moral Law binds the Con|&s;ciences of all Men to Obedience, &s;o that none have Rea&s;on pre&s;umptuou&s;ly to con|clude to their Ruin, <HI>We may live as we li&s;t, and who is Lord over us?</HI> And indeed

<P N="3">3dly. The <HI>Moral Law</HI> being <HI>&s;piritual, pure, perfect,</HI> the exact Model and in|flexible Standard of Integrity has a noble Tendency to &s;hew us that we are <HI>carnal, impure</HI> and <HI>imperfect.</HI> When this <HI>Law</HI> by the Spirit's Influence <HI>enters</HI> into the Soul and Con&s;cience, <HI>then does Sin abound</HI> in our View, in re&s;pect of its Number, Aggrava|tions and Demerit; and thus we are con|vinc'd of our Inability to fulfil it, and humbled under a Sen&s;e of Sin and Mi&s;ery, as well as thereby induc'd to behold our ab&s;olute Need of a Redeemer's Obedience together with the Perfection of it, to an|&s;wer the Law's Demands.</P>

<P>DEAR Brethren! Seeing the right Under&s;tanding of the proper U&s;e of the Law of God, together with its <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Excellency,</HI> is of &s;o great Moment in Religion, I hope you will not think it &s;trange that I have repeat|edly in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;o important a Subject, and e&s;pecially con&s;idering, that it is &s;omewhat difficult to explain and &s;tate in an ea&s;y Light, to the Overthrow of all the Cavils and So|phi&s;ms with which it has been ob&s;cur'd and oppos'd, either by the De&s;igning or Inju|dicious: This I could not do in a very narrow Compa&s;s, and therefore have been led reluctant to Proxility.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="005697_0187_1026C387C3D9A820">I have been likewi&s;e induced, my Bre|thren, the more to ruminate upon this Sub|ject, becau&s;e it is much mi&s;under&s;tood by &s;ome, and &s;lighted by others in the pre&s;ent Day!</P>
<P>It is certainly our Duty in a &s;pecial Man|ner, to labour to under&s;tand well tho&s;e precious Truths, that are controverted in the Times and Places in which we live, (e&s;pecially if they concern practical Reli|gion, and have con&s;iderable Influence upon it) that &s;o we may be pre&s;erv'd from the Infection of the Times, and glorify God as his Witne&s;&s;es, in bearing a judicious and faithful Te&s;timony to God's Truths, how|ever they are ignorantly oppo&s;ed by &s;ome, and ba&s;ely di&s;&s;erted and betrayed by others!</P>
<P>It is as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>the ignorant and un&s;table, that wre&s;t the Scrip|tures to their own De&s;truction:</HI> It is the&s;e <HI>&s;imple, &s;illy</HI> Souls, that fal&s;e Teachers <HI>deceive with their good Words and fair Speeches,</HI> and therefore it is no wonder they cry out again&s;t <HI>Head-Knowledge,</HI> becau&s;e it ob|&s;tructs the Spread of their erroneous, in|con&s;i&s;tent

and non&s;en&s;ical Sentiments, tho' in the mean time, the God of Truth on the contrary denounces his awful Judg|ments upon the Ignorant, <HI>this is a People of no Under&s;tanding, and therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will &s;hew them no fa|vour.</HI></P>
<P>My Dear Brethren! forget not to ab|hor and oppo&s;e that vile <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Notion, <HI>that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion!</HI> If they had &s;aid that it was the Mother of <HI>Super&s;tition, Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> and <HI>Non&s;en&s;e,</HI> they wou'd have &s;aid right, but true Reli|gion is grounded in Knowledge.

What remains now, is to offer &s;ome more &s;criptural <HI>Characters</HI> or Properties of the Moral Law, to an&s;wer

&s;ome <HI>Objections,</HI> and then proceed to the <HI>Improvement</HI> of the whole. The</P>
<P><HI>Sixth</HI> Character therefore that I wou'd mention, is, that it is a <HI>perfect Law.</HI> Now the Law of God is perfect in the following Re&s;pects, <HI>viz. E&s;&s;entially, Exten&s;ively, In|ten&s;ively,</HI> and <HI>Finally.</HI></P>
<P>The Law is perfect in its <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> &s;o as to contain in it a compleat Rule of all things, that are to be done and a|voided by every one, towards God and towards his Neighbour; &s;o that there is no Work truly and properly Good, which does not agree with it, and is not pre&s;crib'd by it. What&s;oever is neither commanded nor forbid by it, is in its Nature indiffe|rent, and left to Men's Liberty, except that Liberty be re&s;trained by &s;ome po&s;&s;itive Precept.</P>
<P>The Moral Law is likewi&s;e perfect <HI>ex|ten&s;ively,</HI> in re&s;pect of its <HI>Parts,</HI> it enjoyns Love to God and Man, and therein in|cludes all the Duties we owe to both; and therefore the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were forbid

<P>Altho' this <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> was much broken by the Fall of Man, yet that there be &s;ome Remains of it in all, we have a|bundant Evidence from <HI>Scripture, Con&s;cience,</HI> the <HI>con&s;ent of Mankind,</HI> and the <HI>Voice</HI> of <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI></P>

<P>If there was no <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> why &s;hould the mo&s;t &s;avage and uncultivated Nations own a &s;upream Being, and that he is to be adored as well as our Parents ho|nour'd, and ju&s;tice maintain'd?

<P>And <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> likewi&s;e gives its <HI>Suffrage</HI> to the Reality of the Law of Nature thus: Seeing the Creature as &s;uch depends una|voidably upon its former, and is govern'd by him <HI>phi&s;ically,</HI> it is ab&s;ur'd to &s;uppo&s;e that it &s;hould not be govern'd by him al&s;o in a <HI>Moral Way,</HI> agreeable to its Nature, which cannot be without a Law.

<P>And indeed innumerable <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tences</HI> follow the contrary Sentiment, <HI>e. g.</HI> If nothing be in its Nature Ju&s;t, but that which Men judge profitable to them, then it follows that Men are born for them&s;elves and not for the Glory of that Being to whom they owe their Original!

Thus every Man's Lu&s;t would be his Rule of Actions, and &s;o a Scene of Confu&s;ion and Blood would open to the utter De&s;truction of the Hu|man Race! If the Law of Nature be de|&s;troy'd, my Brethren, then are the Founda|tions of civil Ju&s;tice unhing'd, from which Fountains i&s;&s;ue Human Laws: Hereby a Way is open'd to <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> in Principle, and the mo&s;t <HI>&s;ordid Evils</HI> in <HI>Practice,</HI> &s;o that all <HI>Religion, Virtue, Order</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> are hereby entirely &s;ubverted, and left ex|piring in the Agonies of Death.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> and the
<PB N="228" REF="005697_0228_1026C3FD94BBB570">
<HI>Moral Law</HI> are the very &s;ame in Sub|&s;tance, the &s;ame Duties towards God and Man, which are pre&s;crib'd by the Moral Law, are contain'd in the Law of Nature: The Sum of the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> as I have before ob&s;erv'd, is to love God and our Neighbour, and this is the very Law of Nature: All the Precepts of the Moral Law are impre&s;s'd on rational Nature, and may be di&s;cover'd by its Light: There is nothing in them but right Rea&s;on dictates or approves of; nothing but what belongs to all Nations in all Ages of the World; nothing but what is nece&s;&s;ary to Human Nature to obtain its proper End, and therefore it ought to be of perpetual Obligation; for rational Nature is ever the &s;ame, and like it&s;elf, and con&s;equently &s;o mu&s;t that which is grounded upon it.</P>
<P>The Difference between the <HI>Moral Law</HI> and the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> is only in <HI>Acci|dentals</HI> and <HI>Circum&s;tantials</HI> as follows: What is contain'd in the Law of Nature, is more clearly and di&s;tinctly declar'd in the Moral Law. The Law of Nature was much ob&s;cur'd by the Fall of Man, and
<PB N="229" REF="005697_0229_1026C3B636FF6820">
therefore there was need of a Renovation of it: The Law of Nature was wrote upon the Mind of Man, and binds all; but the Moral Law upon Tables of Stone, and belongs to tho&s;e that are privileged with the Knowledge of it: The Law of Na|ture has nothing but what is Moral in it; but the Moral Law contains &s;ome Things that are <HI>po&s;itive or ceremonial,</HI> not in its <HI>Pre|cepts</HI> but in the <HI>Arguments</HI> exciting to the Performance of them. Thus the fir&s;t Command is enforc'd by an Argument of Gratitude peculiar to the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Na|tion, viz. <HI>God's bringing them out of</HI> Egypt. And &s;o as to the Fourth, tho' the Duty en|joyn'd be Moral, namely the <HI>Dedication</HI> of a <HI>&s;eventh Part</HI> of <HI>our Time,</HI> or one Day in Seven to the <HI>Wor&s;hip of God;</HI> yet the <HI>Specification</HI> of one Day rather than another for that purpo&s;e is only po&s;itive and therefore alterable; for there is no real Difference in the &s;everal Parts of Time as to their <HI>Nature,</HI> all Time is alike in it&s;elf, and therefore equally fit for Reli|gious Wor&s;hip: And thus it evidently ap|pears that the <HI>Specification</HI> of one Day
<PB N="230" REF="005697_0230_1026C40210C6CCC0">
rather than another cannot be <HI>moral Na|tural,</HI> or grounded upon the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things. This, learned Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> repre&s;ents in the following Manner. <Q>The Moral Law required no more than one Day of Seven to be kept as a Day of Holy Re&s;t, not this or that particu|lar Day; the <HI>Jews</HI> learn'd it from the Ceremonial Law, as Chri&s;tians learn theirs from Chri&s;t's and the Apo&s;tles Practice. Nor is it any Objection a|gain&s;t this that the &s;eventh Day from the Creation is mentioned in the Law to tho&s;e who know how to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the <HI>Precept</HI> and <HI>the Argument,</HI> the Seventh from the Creation is not in the <HI>Precept</HI> but in the <HI>Argument: For in Six Days,</HI> &amp;c. Now there is nothing more Ordinary than to have Arguments of a particular temporary Con|cernment u&s;ed to inforce Precepts of an eternal Obligation; where the Pre|cepts were fir&s;t given to that particular People, as to whom tho&s;e Arguments were of Force, an In&s;tance of which is in the fir&s;t Commandment as well as
<PB N="231" REF="005697_0231_1026C3BA92F6B0C8">
in this: As on the other &s;ide Arguments of univer&s;al Force are oft annext to Pre|cepts which had but a particular Obli|gation upon a particular People for a Time.

<P>I may add that what has been &s;aid is farther confirm'd by an Argument or Ex|citement of a temporary Nature, which is annex'd to the 5th Commandment, <HI>That thy Days may be long upon the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</HI> This certainly intended the earthly <HI>Canaan</HI> which was promis'd to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and &s;o had &s;omething in it peculiar to that Nation which does not extend to us. Now I &s;ay excepting tho&s;e Arguments mentioned, which are annex'd to the Fir&s;t, Fourth, and Fifth Commands, the whole Moral Law is the very &s;ame with the Law of Na|ture, and therefore perpetually binding.</P>

The <HI>Law</HI> &s;ends us to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ends us back to the Law for <HI>Direction.</HI> The Law helps us to &s;ee the ab&s;olute Need of the Go&s;pel, and the Go&s;pel opens before us the tran&s;cendent Excellency of the Law. O let us admire the Wi&s;dom, the Good|ne&s;s, the Holine&s;s and Love of God, di&s;|play'd in this <HI>Harmony!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly:</HI> From what has been &s;aid, we may learn the Danger of rejecting the Law of God. This &s;trikes at the Foundations of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and directly tends to de&s;troy it entirely! For</P>
<P>Hereby an awful <HI>Bar</HI> is put in the Way of <HI>Conviction, Faith, Repentance, Conver|&s;ion, Ju&s;tification, Con&s;olation,</HI> and &s;o by con&s;equence of <HI>eternal Salvation!</HI> How &s;hall poor Sinners be convinc'd if that Law be de&s;troy'd by which is the Knowledge of Sin? And is there any probability that &s;uch as are whole in their own Eyes, will apply in earne&s;t to Chri&s;t for a Cure?
<PB N="236" REF="005697_0236_1026C40A8A16DED8">
Or that tho&s;e who &s;ee no Danger, will fly by Faith to the Refuge &s;et before them?</P>
<P>If there be no Law their can be no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of it, or in other Words, no Sin: And if there be no Sin, what need is there of Repentance? Shall People repent over what is not? No &s;urely! And what need is there of a <HI>Saviour,</HI> to deliver from nothing?</P>
<P>And if the <HI>Moral Law</HI> is de&s;troy'd, does not Ju&s;tification fall with it? For is not that a Sentence judicially pronounc'd ac|cording to Law? And how cruel and per|nicious is it to rob poor Sinners of a Mean of their Conver&s;ion to God?</P>
<P>Neither can their be any &s;uch Thing as Sanctification or Holine&s;s upon Earth, with|out the Moral Law. For what is Sancti|fication, but an inward and outward Con|formity thereto, or a renewing us after the Image of God, which is his Law? With|out this, all <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> ina&s;much as they are neither requir'd by God, nor done in Obedience to his com|manding Authority, (according to the Scheme I propo&s;e) are all <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> and
<PB N="237" REF="005697_0237_1026C3C38636F528">
<HI>Will-wor&s;hip;</HI> and con&s;equently in&s;tead of being plea&s;ing to God, do provoke his In|dignation; becau&s;e they imply a Reflection upon his Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s or Fidelity; as if he either knew not how to furni&s;h his Creatures with a perfect Law for their Direction, or wanted Goodne&s;s and Faith|fulne&s;s to act in pur&s;uance of his Wi&s;dom!</P>
<P>When Men reject the Law of God, they renounce Interpretatively, his Dominion over them, and commence their own Lord's and Ma&s;ters. And as to their Acts of Ver|tue and Religion, this Query &s;poils them all, <HI>Who hath required the&s;e Things at your Hands?</HI> And how &s;hall tho&s;e that are con|verted, prize Chri&s;t as a Fountain, when the <HI>Gla&s;s</HI> that di&s;covers their Blemi&s;hes is broken and ca&s;t away? Or how &s;hall they live daily upon his Offices, without a Sight of their Need of them?</P>
<P>Nor is <HI>Ignorance</HI> of our Sins in Heart and Life, the Way to true and real Hu|mility: For how &s;hall tho&s;e be di&s;covered to us, without comparing our &s;elves with that Law of God, of which Sin is a Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="005697_0238_1026C40C0FB78B58">And are we like to extol the Glory of pure pardoning Grace, while the Sins for|given are hid from our View by rejecting the Law of God?</P>
<P>Is there any Perfection of the ble&s;&s;ed God, more venerable and amiable than his Holine&s;s? Of this the Seraphs &s;hout with Joy and Tran&s;port, &s;aying, <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Ho&s;ts!</HI> And certainly a Gladne&s;s, and Satisfaction ari&s;es to the Saints on Earth in &s;ome degree from a View thereof. Now does it not tend to mar their Joy and Satisfaction in this At|tribute, when the <HI>Law,</HI> that Image of the divine <HI>Purity</HI> is rejected? <HI>Surely in keeping God's Commands there is a great Re|ward.</HI></P>
<P>If our <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> be not built upon a right <HI>Foundation,</HI> they are wor&s;e than none. And is the Foundation like to be well laid, while we are ignorant of our Sins thro' a Slight of the Law of God, the appointed Mean of Self-Knowledge?</P>
<P>Not to &s;ay that it is hard to conceive how any &s;hould be acquitted at the la&s;t

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY Brethren! The three principal Things in the Chri&s;tian <HI>Religion,</HI> are <HI>Knowledge, Faith</HI> and <HI>Prac|tice,</HI> without which it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Object</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed God,</HI> is to be known and believ'd in as the fir&s;t <HI>Truth, lov'd</HI> as the <HI>chief Good,</HI> and <HI>obey'd</HI> as the <HI>&s;upreme Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Subject</HI> of <HI>Religion, Man,</HI> mu&s;t have his <HI>Mind enlightned</HI> with the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> his <HI>Will adorn'd</HI> with the <HI>Belief</HI> of it, and <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Good,</HI> as well as his <HI>Life beautified</HI> with <HI>practical Holine&s;s,</HI> or <HI>good Works.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="005697_0311_1026C50B07A65FC0">The very <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> requires or includes <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> and therefore it is frequently repre&s;ented in Scripture under the Character of <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> and eternal Life is a&s;crib'd to it.</P>
<P>And the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> namely <HI>Hap|pine&s;s,</HI> includes the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of <HI>God, Faith</HI> in <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>Conformity</HI> to <HI>him,</HI> or <HI>Obedience.</HI> In <HI>Heaven</HI> the <HI>Saints</HI> will <HI>&s;ee Jehovah as he is, and be like him;</HI> there <HI>Knowledge, Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> will be <HI>perfect.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;acred Scriptures propo&s;e to us <HI>Doctrines</HI> to be <HI>known, Promi&s;es</HI> and <HI>Threatnings</HI> to be <HI>believ'd,</HI> and <HI>Precepts</HI> to be obey'd; and indeed the one prepares the Way for the other.</P>
<P>Without <HI>Knowledge, Faith</HI> is <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ti|cal Ra&s;hne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Delu&s;ion,</HI> and without <HI>Faith, Knowledge</HI> is but <HI>barren Speculation;</HI> without <HI>Knowledge, Practice</HI> is <HI>blind Super|&s;tition,</HI> and without <HI>Faith, formal Devoti|on!</HI></P>
<P>It is the la&s;t of the Three that I am to di&s;cour&s;e upon at pre&s;ent, namely, <HI>Practice,</HI>

or <HI>Good</HI> Works, which are indeed the <HI>Fruit</HI> and <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of the former.</P>
<P>In the preceeding <HI>Sermon,</HI> after an In|troduction, I ob&s;erv'd, that there be three Things contain'd in the Text, <HI>viz.</HI>

This Con&s;ideration much affected the P&s;almi&s;t, (and well it might) <HI>Thou knowe&s;t</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>my down-&s;itting and my up-ri&s;ing, thou un|der&s;tande&s;t my Thought afar off, thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pa&s;&s;e&s;t my path, and my lying-down, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> acquainted with all my Ways.&mdash;Such Know|ledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. The Darkne&s;s is as the Light to God, and the Night &s;hines as the Day.</HI> O Sirs! the Thoughts of God's <HI>all-&s;eeing Eye</HI> being continually upon us, beholding us in our mo&s;t &s;ecure Retreats, is enough to make us fear and tremble be|fore him.</P>
<P>Add to this the inflexible <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> which di&s;po&s;es him to render to all accord|ing to their Works; this is impartial in its Executions, it will not &s;pare becau&s;e of the Number or Quality of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, but render to them exactly according to the Degrees of their Guilt, and when the Time of Probation expires, it is inexora|ble;
<PB N="354" REF="005697_0353_1026C546F4E45438">
this excites Jehovah's <HI>Power,</HI> and awakes his <HI>Wrath</HI> to Arms; this makes his <HI>Vengeance</HI> burn and &s;parkle again&s;t in|dolent and ob&s;tinate Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; this opens impending Clouds of <HI>Indignation,</HI> and makes them break into re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Tor|rents of Woe, which drown Sinners in a &s;uddain Death, and &s;weep them off the burden'd Globe, into a &s;wift, certain, and eternal De&s;truction!</P>
<P>And how affecting likewi&s;e, dear Bre|thren, is the <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Immen&s;ity</HI> of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD! which fills Heaven and Earth, and infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;es the Bounds of Matter! Tho' the Globe we tread upon be very exten&s;ive, yet it is but a Point compar'd with the vi&s;ible Heavens, and that, it is probable, is much exceeded by the third Heaven; and yet we are inform'd, that <HI>the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain God.</HI> The Sinner therefore cannot e&s;cape his Cognizance or Ju&s;tice; this Thought affected the P&s;almi&s;t, who &s;peaks in the following Manner re&s;pecting it; <HI>Whither &s;hall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither &s;hall I flee from thy Pre&s;ence? If I a&s;cend up

into Heaven, thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermo&s;t Parts of the Sea; even there &s;hall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand &s;hall hold me.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxxxix. 8, 9.</NOTE> If we a&s;cend <HI>Carmel</HI>'s Top, or dive the Ocean's Depths, God is there. <HI>He is wi&s;e in Heart and mighty in Strength, who has hardened him&s;elf again&s;t God and pro&s;pered?</HI></P>
<P>And does not the <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> lay us under &s;trong and ingenuous Engage|ments to fear him? O is it not the vile&s;t <HI>Ingratitude</HI> to offend &s;uch a faithful Friend, &s;uch an indulgent Father, &s;uch a bounteous Benefactor, and requite him evil for good? Will not therefore our fear of di&s;plea&s;ing him, ri&s;e in Proportion to the Degree of our Love to him, and that in Proportion to the Degree of our Faith in his Promi&s;es, and View of his Excellencies?</P>
<P>Now Sirs, if we compare our <HI>Vilene&s;s</HI> with God's <HI>Purity,</HI> our <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> with his <HI>Almightine&s;s,</HI> our <HI>Ignorance</HI> with his <HI>Know|ledge,</HI>

our <HI>Guilt</HI> with his <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> our <HI>Cru|elty</HI> with his <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> may not this View make us fear and tremble before him? Moreover, is it not congruous to the State of a dependent Creature, to fear and trem|ble before his great Lord and Sovereign, to whom he owes, and on whom depends his All?</P>
<P>Yea, my Brethren, as the <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is the di&s;tingui&s;hing <HI>Character</HI> of his People, and the <HI>Foundation</HI> of all <HI>Religion,</HI> &s;o the con&s;tant Sen&s;e of it, is of peculiar Service to promote its Intere&s;t in the Souls of Men: by this they are more conform'd to God in Holine&s;s, and di&s;pos'd to perform Acts of Wor&s;hip to him, with a Decency and Reverence becoming a Creature to his Lord and Sovereign; and by this many hurtful Exce&s;&s;es are prevented; without this, we are like a Ve&s;&s;el that has large Sails but no Balla&s;t, and is in the mean time beat upon with boi&s;terous Winds and angry Waves; without this, our <HI>Faith</HI> degenerates into <HI>Pre&s;umption,</HI> our <HI>Love</HI> into an <HI>effeminate Fondne&s;s,</HI> our <HI>Hope</HI> into <HI>Impudence,</HI> our <HI>Joy</HI> into <HI>Froth</HI> and <HI>Lightne&s;s,</HI> our &s;uppos'd

<HI>Communion</HI> with God, into an <HI>undecent Ir|reverence,</HI> as if we were upon a par with him, who are but Worms of the Du&s;t, that are cru&s;h'd before the Moth, and lighter than Vanity.</P>
<P>And indeed without the Fear of God, we are apt to be catch'd unawares, and fall heed|le&s;s and headlong into every &s;inful Snare that we are expos'd to. <HI>Abraham</HI> the Friend of God, excell'd in this ornamental Grace. After his extraordinary Vi&s;ion, he &s;peaks in the following Strain; <HI>How dread|ful is this Place? This is no other than the Hou&s;e of God, and this is the Gate of Hea|ven.</HI> And upon another Occa&s;ion, with what Reverence did he addre&s;s God, &s;ay|ing, <HI>Behold I that am but du&s;t and A&s;hes, have taken upon me to &s;peak to God. O let not the Lord he angry!</HI> In fine, the <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is the <HI>Root</HI> of all true <HI>Religion,</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is the <HI>Rule</HI> of it, and Obe|dience to that Law, is the natural and ne|ce&s;&s;ary <HI>Fruit</HI> thence i&s;&s;uing, all which Par|ticulars, are excellently repre&s;ented by <HI>So|lomon</HI> in the Clo&s;e of his Book of <HI>Eccle&s;i|a&s;tes,</HI> with who&s;e Words I &s;hall conclude;

<HI>Let us hear the Conclu&s;ion of the whole Mat|ter, fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole Duty of Man. For God &s;hall bring every Work into Judgment, with every &s;ecret Thing, whether it be good or whether it be Evil.</HI></P>
