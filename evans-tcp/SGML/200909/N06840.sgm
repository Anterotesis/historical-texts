<Q><BIBL>PSALM XCVIII. 1, 2.</BIBL>
<P>O SING unto the Lord a new &s;ong, for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_WHOEVER has been much conver&s;ant in the holy &s;criptures, has, I &s;uppo&s;e, made the two following ob&s;ervations. The fir&s;t, That the prophetic writers, after &s;peaking of &s;ome recent, common events, and things of a &s;ecular nature, often &s;lide, al|mo&s;t imperceptibly, into futurity; or into the mention of tho&s;e things that pertain to the kingdom of God under the reign of the Me&s;&s;iah. So that while a per|&s;on thinks he is reading only about certain ordinary occurrents, and expects to meet with nothing el&s;e, he finds him&s;elf &s;uddenly carried into future times with
<PB N="6" REF="008668_0004_102FB1F18848E538">
the prophet; even into the later periods of the chri&s;|tian di&s;pen&s;ation, concerning which the mo&s;t glorious things are foretold.</P>
<P>THE other ob&s;ervation alluded to above, is, That in the prophetic writings, what is &s;poken primarily concerning worldly things and events then pre&s;ent, pa&s;t, or &s;peedily to come to pa&s;s, has often a reference to other matters; to things &s;piritual and future; and not only future, but far di&s;tant; and indeed princi|pally re&s;pects the&s;e: viz. the per&s;on, offices, and reign of Chri&s;t; and the glory of his kindgdom in the latter days. So that in one view, the &s;ame pa&s;|&s;age is &s;ometimes common hi&s;tory, and in another view, illu&s;trious prophecy; &s;ome word or clau&s;e being purpo&s;ely in&s;erted, which determines the pa&s;&s;age to be of the prophetical kind; and chiefly to relate to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, even while a great, or perhaps the greater part of it, has a plain reference to other matters, more common and familiar.</P>
<P>MANY of the p&s;alms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As for in&s;tance, the 2nd, 72nd and 89th p&s;alms. The pa&s;|&s;ages of &s;cripture which have &s;uch a double meaning, are indeed numerous, both in the old and new te&s;tament. And they partake of the nature of parables, or allegories; which are &s;ometimes literally true, either in part or whole: But what is chiefly intended in them, is the <HI>moral,</HI> or &s;piri|tual meaning couched under tho&s;e common words &amp; phra&s;|es. And, what this &s;econdary, yet principal, and ultimate &s;en&s;e is, may generally at lea&s;t, if not always, be determined with great ea&s;e and certainty by the di&s;cerning and judici|ous. Tho' it mu&s;t not be denied, that &s;ome whim&s;ical, but well meaning people, have made very odd work with &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, by over &s;training them; and have &s;ometimes con|ceited a double meaning without any apparent rea&s;on for it: whereby they have given too much occa&s;ion to others to ri|dicule the whole notion of types, and a double &s;en&s;e, as tho' it were in it&s;elf ab&s;urd.</NOTE> of David are plain exam|ples, and undeniable proofs, of both the&s;e ob&s;ervati|ons.
<PB N="7" REF="008668_0005_102FB23AB1CAD380">
And the 98th p&s;alm, the beginning of which I have cho&s;en for the ground of my di&s;cour&s;es on the pre&s;ent joyful occa&s;ion, is an example of the latter of them.</P>
<P>IN this p&s;alm David prai&s;es God, and exhorts others to prai&s;e him, on account of &s;ome &s;ignal appearances of his providence in favour of his cho&s;en people; in &s;aving them from, and giving them victory over their enemies; hereby openly &s;hewing his righteou&s;ne&s;s to the heathen nations around them. This is doubtle&s;s the primary de&s;ign of the p&s;alm; at lea&s;t, of the for|mer part of it: But it is not the principal, or ultimate. In its chief and ultimate view, it is a prophecy of what was to come to pa&s;s in the days of the Me&s;&s;iah; when God was, by him, to make known his &s;alvation in a far higher, and more illu&s;trious &s;en&s;e; and to reveal his righteou&s;ne&s;s, not only to the heathen na|tions in, and round about the land of Canaan, but to the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth. So it is &s;aid, ver. 3d, in the time <HI>pa&s;t</HI> (as is common in the language of pro|phecy, to denote the immutable certainty of the thing &s;poken of)
<Q>He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the hou&s;e of I&s;rael: ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH <HI>have</HI> &s;een the &s;alvation of our God.</Q>
In con&s;equence whereof, not only I&s;rael, but all the earth, is called upon in the following ver|&s;es, to make a joyful noi&s;e unto the Lord, to rejoice and &s;ing his prai&s;es. Yea, the &s;ea, and the fulne&s;s thereof, are bid to join in this concert; the world, and they that dwell therein, while
<Q>the floods clap their hands, and the hills are joyful together.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is both extremely &s;ublime, and very natural; &s;ince the main &s;ubject of the p&s;alm, is that glorious reign of Chri&s;t, before the conclu&s;ion of which there
<PB N="8" REF="008668_0006_102FB1F44081E200">
is to be a general "re&s;titution", or renovation of all things; even of the material earth and heavens. For behold, &s;aith the Lord, I make all things new: And we, according to his promi&s;e, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s. And indeed this p&s;alm it&s;elf, tho' a &s;hort one, looks for|ward to the time of our Lord's &s;econd coming;
<Q>whom the heavens mu&s;t receive, [only] until the&s;e times of re&s;titution of all things, which God hath &s;poken of by the mouth of all his holy prophets, &s;ince the world began.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts III. 21.</NOTE></Q> For it is to be ob&s;erved, that all things rational and irrational, animate and inanimate, are called upon thus to rejoice together,
<Q>BEFORE THE LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: With righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall he judge the world, and the people with equity;</Q>
as the p&s;alm con|cludes.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the text:
<Q>O &s;ing unto the Lord a new &s;ong, for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory. The Lord hath made known his &s;al|vation: his righteou&s;ne&s;s hath he openly &s;hewed in the &s;ight of the heathen.</Q>
This pa&s;&s;age, as before ob&s;erved, has undoubtedly a reference to &s;ome very remarkable deliverance which God had vouch&s;afed to his people I&s;rael, and to his &s;ubduing their enemies under them; hereby making manife&s;t his righteou&s;|ne&s;s to their heathen neighbours. In con&s;equence whereof, the I&s;raelites are admoni&s;hed to &s;ing
<Q>a new &s;ong;</Q>
which was not u&s;ed to be done, but upon &s;ome very &s;ignal occa&s;ion. But while the pa&s;&s;age has &s;uch a retro&s;pect to things and events already pa&s;t, it does, without all rea&s;onable doubt, look forward to things and events then, and even &s;till future. And this new &s;ong, con&s;idered in the ultimate view of the pa&s;&s;age, may probably be no other than that menti|oned in the revelation of St. John.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="008668_0007_102FB23DE68A93C0">THE pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, you are &s;en&s;ible, leads us directly and immediately to con&s;ider this pa&s;&s;age, only as an exhortation to prai&s;e God for the temporal &s;al|vation, the &s;ucce&s;&s;es and victories, with which at any time he favours his people: but e&s;pecially when the&s;e are very &s;ignal and illu&s;trious; &s;o that by them, God may be &s;aid to make known his &s;alvation, and openly to &s;hew his righteou&s;ne&s;s in the &s;ight of the heathen. Which is &s;trictly and literally applicable to what he hath lately done for us, at lea&s;t here in America. But having con&s;idered and applied the pa&s;&s;age in this view of it, I am per&s;uaded, you will think it proper for us then to extend our views beyond the&s;e temporal con|cernments; and briefly to con&s;ider what a&s;pect our military &s;ucce&s;&s;es have upon the kingdom of Chri&s;t, the exten&s;ion thereof, and its e&s;tabli&s;hment in its pow|er and purity thro'out the earth. For this is not only that event, to which the pa&s;&s;age ultimately relates; but it is what we all do, or &s;hould, firmly believe and pray for, whenever we repeat tho&s;e words&mdash;
<Q>Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven!</Q>
And our late victories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es may, not improbably, contribute to the accompli&s;h|ment of this great event.</P>
<P>BUT before I come to &s;peak particularly of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which have lately attended the arms of our king; and of our obligation to &s;ing a new &s;ong on ac|count of them; it will be proper to ob&s;erve and il|lu&s;trate one mo&s;t important point of doctrine contained in the text; and which is really the foundation of all the gratitude and prai&s;e, which we owe to almighty God for them. It is this; That God is truly the author of all our deliverances from, &s;ucce&s;&s;es again&s;t, and victories over, our worldly enemies. You &s;ee that the&s;e are in the text a&s;cribed to God; there
<PB N="10" REF="008668_0008_102FB1FA15A1CBC8">
being no particular mention made, &s;o much as of any means or in&s;truments, employed by him in bringing them to pa&s;s. Altho' means and in&s;truments are at lea&s;t generally, if not always &s;uppo&s;ed, in &s;uch ca&s;es; yet the p&s;almi&s;t here takes no particular notice of any, but attributes all directly to God. The Lord hath done marvellous things, &s;ays he; his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory. He is ac|cordingly &s;aid to have made known <HI>his</HI> &s;alvation hereby; and to have openly &s;hewed his righteou&s;|ne&s;s to the heathen: Tho' po&s;&s;ibly there might have been nothing of a miraculous kind, &s;trictly &s;peaking, in the deliverance and &s;ucce&s;&s;es wherewith God had favoured his people, and which are here primarily in|tended. At lea&s;t this is &s;uppo&s;eable; for the &s;ame kind of language is often u&s;ed in &s;cripture, re&s;pecting tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es and victories, which were confe&s;&s;edly brought about only by natural, ordinary and human means; which is &s;ufficient to my pre&s;ent de&s;ign. And &s;o much it was needful to ob&s;erve, previou&s;ly to my entering upon it. For, intirely &s;etting a&s;ide the ca&s;e of miraculous interpo&s;itions, with which we our &s;elves are not now concerned; it is propo&s;ed, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to illu&s;trate and confirm the propo&s;ition mentioned above, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that things come to pa&s;s according to what is called the e&s;tabli&s;hed cour&s;e of nature, and the &s;ettled order of things. For even upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, as well as in tho&s;e ca&s;es where miracles are to be admitted&punc; all our temporal deliverances, victories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es are from almighty God:&mdash;Otherwi&s;e indeed, I know not what rea&s;on we have to prai&s;e him for them, however great or important they are in them&s;elves. And this is cer|tainly a point, very &s;uitable to employ our thoughts at this &s;ea&s;on, and upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="008668_0009_102FB23F6F1ED208">HOWEVER, you will ob&s;erve that it is not &s;o much the proof, &s;trictly &s;peaking, as the illu&s;tration of this point, that is now intended: Becau&s;e it is taken for granted, that we all in general believe this to be true already; and therefore do not need to have it proved to us in a formal manner. But yet it may be profi|table to many, and indeed to all of us, to hear &s;ome reflections and remarks upon it, by way of illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>SOME general notion of a providence &s;uperintend|ing the world, and the concerns of mankind, has been common in all parts and ages of the world; and al&s;o common to all per&s;ons, with a very few exceptions. The ancient epicureans, indeed, denied a providence, while they profe&s;&s;ed to believe there were Gods in great number; &s;o many, that it were ea&s;ier to call all the &s;tars by their names, than to give a catalogue of them. But perhaps they acknowledged a deity, or deities, only to avoid the general odium of mankind, being nothing better than athei&s;ts in di&s;gui&s;e; if in|deed there be any &s;uch thing as &s;peculative, or philo|&s;ophical athei&s;m. But at this day all profe&s;&s;ed thei&s;ts, to be &s;ure all chri&s;tians, believe a providence; how|ever crude, indige&s;ted, and partial, the conceptions of many per&s;ons may be concerning it. None of the&s;e imagine, as the epicureans affected to do, that God is too indolent, or that he di&s;daineth, to concern him|&s;elf about the things that are done on earth, even tho' he humbleth him&s;elf when he beholdeth them that are done in heaven; in tho&s;e heavens, which are not clean in his &s;ight, and the angels whereof he chargeth with folly.</P>
<P>NOW, if there be any &s;uch thing as a providence, conver&s;ant and active about men, and their temporal concernments, which is taken for granted; certainly
<PB N="12" REF="008668_0010_102FB1FB9EF29798">
national wars and their events, mu&s;t be under God's particular in&s;pection and &s;uperintendence; the&s;e be|ing, in their nature, of the highe&s;t importance, and the con&s;equences of them mo&s;t exten&s;ive and intere&s;t|ing. It is on the conduct, &s;ucce&s;s and i&s;&s;ue of battles and wars, that the temporal welfare of nations princi|pally depends, from generation to generation. And not only their temporal, but their &s;piritual welfare al&s;o, depends in a great mea&s;ure upon the management and i&s;&s;ue of wars. For hereby it is frequently determin|ed, in effect, not only whether people &s;hall enjoy their native country, their laws, their civil rights and liberties; but al&s;o whether they &s;hall lo&s;e or enjoy their religion, with their &s;piritual privileges; and whe|ther their po&s;terity &s;hall be of this or that religion, or perhaps of none at all.</P>
<P>WHOEVER is conver&s;ant in hi&s;tory, or is tolerably acquainted with the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world, knows that the religious &s;tate of countries is often determined, almo&s;t unavoidably, to be what it is in general, by wars and conque&s;ts; almo&s;t as certain|ly as their political and civil &s;tate. How often does the conqueror deprive the conquered of their old re|ligion, either in whole or in part; and give them a new one in its room? Which is done, either by right down tyrannical impo&s;ition, or el&s;e by allowing &s;ome peculiar privileges of a &s;ecular nature to tho&s;e who will make an exchange; which latter, though it be a gentler and more humane way of bringing about a revolution in religion, and may require more time, is not perhaps a le&s;s efficacious and certain one in the end. Sometimes both the&s;e methods are employed at once. And what is it, for example, that hath made almo&s;t all the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> mahometans? tho&s;e who, at lea&s;t who&s;e fore-fathers, were once chri&s;tians? What is it that hath
<PB N="13" REF="008668_0011_102FB2455A3AC478">
produc'd &s;o prodigious an alteration in the religious &s;tate of tho&s;e countries, in &s;o con&s;iderable a part of Europe, A&s;ia and Africa? The vi&s;ible, apparent cau|&s;es hereof, were the wars and conque&s;ts of the Sara|cens; of Mahomet and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and the vari|ous methods u&s;ed by them to &s;uppre&s;s the religion of Chri&s;t, and to propagate the impo&s;ture of the Coran.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or mahometan bible.</NOTE> This is only mentioned as one remarkable example of what is u&s;ually the effect of conque&s;ts in a greater or le&s;s degree. It cannot, however, be denied, that the changes thus introduced in religion, are &s;ometimes for the better, as well as often for the wor&s;e. As, for in&s;tance, &s;ince the time of Oliver Cromwell, at lea&s;t of William III, the roman catholic religion has, I &s;uppo&s;e, been gradually lo&s;ing, and the prote&s;tant gaining ground, in Ireland: And this, without per&s;e|cution, inqui&s;itions and racks; which are abhorrent from the principles of the latter, tho' very con&s;onant to the &s;pirit and temper of too many of its profe&s;&s;ors. Now, if this be indeed God's world, and in any pro|per &s;en&s;e under his in&s;pection and government, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that he mu&s;t, in &s;ome way or other, order and determine the&s;e great events of war, by which almo&s;t all other things are, in effect, determin|ed; both in the religious and civil &s;tate of nations. If we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ucce&s;s and victory are not owing to the influence and operation, or the provi|dential government of God, we &s;hould take a great and mo&s;t material part of his work out of his hands; leav|ing him, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, but very little to do in the admini&s;tration of this world. On this &s;uppo&s;ition, the world would be govern'd almo&s;t without him; even with re&s;pect to the greate&s;t, and mo&s;t intere&s;ting events and revolutions, that come to pa&s;s therein from age to age! And if we could once &s;uppo&s;e, that God does
<PB N="14" REF="008668_0012_102FB1FD347A76A8">
not concern him&s;elf about the&s;e matters, the wars of nations, their conduct, and various i&s;&s;ues; if we could once imagine, that &s;ome mighty empires are reduced, overturned and ruined, while other kingdoms are founded, extended, and made formidable, indepen|dently of God, or without his providential influence and ordination; we might then come into this farther conclu&s;ion, naturally, if not nece&s;&s;arily flowing from &s;uch premi&s;es, viz. That all other events in this world al&s;o come to pa&s;s independently of God; they being apparently of le&s;s con&s;equence to the world than the&s;e. But as this would be directly to adopt the old epicurean &s;y&s;tem, which was really no better than di&s;gui&s;ed athei&s;m, it is concluded, nothing needs to be &s;aid in confutation of it in a chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>BUT, from the&s;e general reflections on the over|ruling providence of God in the &s;ucce&s;s and i&s;&s;ue of wars, we will, if you plea&s;e, proceed now to take a nearer and more particular view of the&s;e important events. We will con&s;ider, what are the u&s;ual, the vi|&s;ible, and more immediate cau&s;es of military &s;ucce&s;&s;es and victories: In doing which, we &s;hall trace the ve&s;|tiges of divine providence. We &s;hall hereby &s;ee &s;ome|thing of the manner, in which God operates to the production of the&s;e effects in ordinary ca&s;es, by the in&s;trumentality of &s;econdary cau&s;es, or natural means: Which, it is hoped, will be a u&s;eful entertainment to us, and particularly &s;ea&s;onable at this time.</P>
<P>WHEN nations are engaged in war, there are divers things, to which &s;ucce&s;s is apparently, and more vi&s;ibly owing, whenever obtain'd; &s;ometimes to one of them, &s;ometimes to another; and &s;ometimes to a coincidence of &s;everal together. And a cur&s;ory review, or brief con&s;ideration of the&s;e things, will &s;erve to illu&s;trate
<PB N="15" REF="008668_0013_102FB246E1DA4668">
and confirm the main point before us; by &s;hewing, that there is no victory, no &s;ucce&s;s in war, but what is ultimately to be re&s;olved into the holy will, the active influence, or providential government of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. TO begin then at the vi&s;ible &s;ource and foun|tain of military enterpri&s;es and operations: Succe&s;s is &s;ometimes more plainly owing to a &s;uperiority of wi&s;|dom in the cabinet, in a king, or his council and mi|ni&s;try, than to any other &s;econdary cau&s;e. For when there is an equality of advantage in all other re&s;pects, &s;uch a &s;uperiority of wi&s;dom at the helm, at lea&s;t or|dinarily determines the &s;ucce&s;s. It is in courts, that the &s;cheme and plan of wars, and the general manner of conducting them, are laid and fixed upon. And one nation often becomes victorious and triumphant, rather than its enemy, becau&s;e there is more wi&s;dom and prudence at the helm, in directing and pointing its military efforts. But from whom, or from whence, did &s;ome kings, their councils or mini&s;ters, derive this &s;uperiority of wi&s;dom and genius? How, for exam|ple, does it come to pa&s;s, that a GEORGE and a PITT have more wi&s;dom than a <HI>Louis</HI> and a <HI>Bellei&s;le?</HI> Is their wi&s;dom &s;elf-derived? or have they more than they received from above? You know, who it is that teacheth man knowledge; who&s;e in&s;piration giveth him under&s;tanding; and from whence all &s;ound judg|ment and coun&s;el comes. It is all originally from God, as truly as the wi&s;dom of prophets and apo&s;tles; tho' not of the &s;ame kind, nor de&s;igned to an&s;wer ex|actly the &s;ame ends.

All other circum|&s;tances being &s;uppo&s;ed alike, &s;uch a difference between the capacities of the re&s;pective commanders of armies, commonly at lea&s;t determines the victory.

And indeed, when there is equal wi&s;dom in the cabinet, equal &s;kill, di&s;cipline and bravery in the field, and all other circum&s;tances are alike favourable to both &s;ides; whenever this is the ca&s;e, it is plain that, without a miracle, victory mu&s;t declare for the mo&s;t numerous ho&s;t.

But &s;ince this is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, let us con&s;ider whence it is, that one nation or country is more populous than another; and able to &s;end more troops into the field. Do men grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly out of the ground, like trees? or ra|ther, as they do not? For it is God's hand that plants and waters, and his &s;un that warms, even the meaner &s;hrubs, as well as the &s;preading oak, the hanging elm, and the cedars of Lebanon, tho&s;e tall and ancient &s;ons of the fore&s;t. Now does God cau&s;e the trees, and even the lowly &s;hrubs, to abound more in one country than another; and do men, who are &s;tiled "his offspring," increa&s;e and multiply with him! Surely they do not. God has not only made all nations to dwell upon the face of the earth; but has determined the times before appointed, in which they live, whether in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or at once; and has even fixed the bounds of their habi|tation

There is indeed no rea&s;on to doubt but that courage, and even bo|dily &s;trength, may be acquir'd and improved by pro|per methods of living, exerci&s;e and di&s;cipline. But this is never actually done independently of divine providence, giving opportunity and occa&s;ion for it, and leading the way to &s;uch improvement. There is of|ten a co-incidence of many things and events, and a long train of particular circum&s;tances, by means whereof the courage and martial prowe&s;s of one na|tion are rai&s;ed and improved to a prodigious height; while in another nation there is no &s;uch train of cir|cum&s;tances, no &s;uch co-incidence of things and events, favourable to a martial &s;pirit: But, on the contrary, &s;uch an one as tends to enfeeble and enervate, to di&s;|pirit and deba&s;e the people. Now this long train of connected circum&s;tances and events, tending to rai&s;e the military &s;pirit of one nation, and to depre&s;s that of another, is certainly never, in the whole of it, the effect of human contrivance, fore&s;ight and ordination, of which it appears to be, at lea&s;t in a great mea&s;ure, independent. It mu&s;t be a&s;cribed at la&s;t to that di|vine providence, which &s;uperintends and over-rules all things. It is, in &s;hort, like the fabulous golden chain of the poets, hung down from heaven to earth; the upper end whereof is far above mortal reach and &s;ight, and there fa&s;tened to the throne of God!&mdash; Whenever, therefore, &s;ucce&s;s in war is more immedi|ately owing, as it often is, to &s;uch a &s;uperiority of martial prowe&s;s and bravery, it may be &s;aid, with the greate&s;t truth and propriety, that God's

But whence is it that one country abounds with provi&s;ions, with all things needful in carrying on a war, or with riches; while another is barren, de&s;ti|tute of the&s;e conveniences, and poor? None of my hearers, certainly, need to be informed from whence, or from whom, the&s;e differences originally proceed: Who it is that giveth corn and wine, wool and flax; that multiplieth the flocks of the &s;hepherd, and feed|eth the cattle upon a thou&s;and hills; that has ap|appointed
<Q>a vein for the &s;ilver, and a place for the gold where they fine it; while iron is taken out of the earth, and bra&s;s is molten out of the &s;tone,</Q> where he has depo&s;ited them: Or, who it is that has ordain|ed and opened the canals of commerce between coun|try and country, either more or le&s;s convenient for mercantile intercour&s;e, for the exchange of commodi|ties, and &s;upplying tho&s;e places with &s;ilver and gold, which are naturally de&s;titute of them.

Whenever, therefore, &s;ucce&s;s in war is owing more vi&s;ibly and immediately to &s;uch plenty, abundance, or &s;uperior riches, the vic|tory is plainly the Lord's: Who giveth the&s;e &s;upplies, in various proportions as he plea&s;eth, out of his own exhau&s;tle&s;s &s;tores and trea&s;uries, to different nations, realms and kingdoms: None of which po&s;&s;e&s;s more of them, than they po&s;&s;e&s;s by his favour and bounty.</P>

<P N="7">7. SUCCESS, when all other circum&s;tances are nearly alike, is &s;ometimes mo&s;t apparently owing to winds, tides and weather; which prove favourable to one fleet or army, and unfavourable to the oppo&s;ite. In all maritime wars, and all military operations which have any connexion with, or relation to, the mighty waters of the ocean, or even to lakes and navigable rivers (as indeed almo&s;t all national wars have, e&s;pe|cially in this age of the world); in all &s;uch wars, a great deal depends upon weather, winds and tides. The&s;e are &s;ometimes &s;o ordered, as to give &s;ucce&s;s and victory even to the inferior fleet or army. Some|times the &s;uperior fleet &s;uffers a terrible &s;hipwrack, and all de&s;igns mi&s;carry therewith; while the inferior rides &s;afely in port, or &s;ails &s;ecurely ju&s;t beyond the limits of the &s;torm, under a &s;erene &s;ky, and pro&s;per|ous gale.

have mi&s;carried; perhaps, been driven on the enemy's coa&s;t, as a &s;ea&s;onable relief to them. Yea, &s;ometimes when well appointed armies have met on the field, and have had no connexion with &s;eas, lakes or rivers; the wind, rain and hail from heaven, by at|tacking one of them in front in the time of battle, have been the means of putting it to the rout, and giving the victory to the weaker army. Hi&s;tory fur|ni&s;hes examples of all the&s;e things. Now you are &s;en&s;ible, that winds and tides, &s;torms and tempe&s;ts, which have &s;uch a mighty influence in wars, e&s;pecially in naval ones, are no ways dependent upon human wi&s;dom or power; but upon almighty God.

&amp;c.</NOTE>. That is, &s;ome unfore|&s;een, un&s;u&s;pected turn, incident or circum&s;tance, not owing to any human providence or contrivance, &s;ome|times gives the race to the &s;lower, and the victory to
<PB N="23" REF="008668_0021_102FB2530FB16138">
the weaker. It were indeed very ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;wifter &s;hould not win the race, all other things and circum&s;tances relative thereto being alike; and the only difference lying in the re&s;pective &s;wiftne&s;s of the runners. This were as ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e, that a winged arrow from a bow, would not reach a di&s;tant goal, tho' there were no ob&s;truction in the way, &s;ooner than the &s;leeping, almo&s;t motionle&s;s &s;nail would crawl to do it. It were al&s;o irrational to &s;up|po&s;e, that the &s;tronger army &s;hould not prevail in the field, all other things and circum&s;tances being alike; and the only difference lying in their re&s;pec|tive power. This were as ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e, that a heavier weight &s;hould not preponderate in an equal balance, and overcome a lighter. We may be &s;ure that Solomon was too much of a philo&s;opher to intend either of the&s;e things, &s;o contrary even to common &s;en&s;e. His meaning, as intimated before, doutle&s;s is, that certain cro&s;s accidents, &s;ini&s;ter and un&s;u&s;pected occur|rents, or ca&s;ualties, &s;ometimes intervene as to one &s;ide, or &s;ome favourable ones as to the other; and &s;natch the victory from the &s;tronger, yea, from the wi&s;er and braver, giving an unexpected triumph to the le&s;s nu|merous and valiant ho&s;t. As al&s;o the &s;wifter, and more expert runner, may be vanqui&s;hed by running at a di&s;advantage, by making one &s;lip, or a &s;ingle mi&s;-&s;tep. Thus it is that, in the language of Solo|mon, time and chance happen to all men. And that great victories have &s;ometimes been thus obtained by inferior, over &s;uperior armies, without any real mi&s;con|duct of the one, or any wi&s;er or braver conduct in the other, hi&s;tory abundantly atte&s;ts. Thus, for illu&s;tra|tion, the better general, with the &s;uperior army, has not always had, nor could have, his choice of ground: Perhaps he was a &s;tranger to the country, and a little too far advanced, or not quite far enough, when he
<PB N="24" REF="008668_0022_102FB2094C1C5780">
was nece&s;&s;itated to come to a battle at a great di&s;advan|tage; which has been the occa&s;ion of victory to the weaker, by whom perhaps the particular time and place of battle, were as un&s;ought for, i. e. as accidental, as they were to the former. So again, when the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions have been made in an army before a battle, upon a rational pre&s;umption that the oppo&s;ite army would be drawn up after &s;uch or &s;uch a manner, this has proved, perhaps, the lo&s;s of the day; there being an order of battle in the latter, materially different from what was, on good grounds, expected: And this po&s;&s;ibly, rather by a mere mi&s;take, or blunder, than from any &s;uperior &s;kill in the art military. So that wi&s;dom on one &s;ide, and want of it on the other, have, by a &s;trange kind of fatality or accident, contri|buted equally to take the victory from the &s;tronger! Yea farther: Battles have been lo&s;t by the &s;tronger, thro' &s;ome unaccountable mi&s;take of orders, or only of a &s;ingle word at a critical juncture, and gained by the weaker; to which deci&s;ion of the day, another, but fortunate mi&s;take in the latter, may have partly contributed! Hi&s;tory, I think, affords examples of all the&s;e things; at lea&s;t, &s;uch examples as are a &s;ufficient ground for the&s;e repre&s;entations: Tho' if it did not, yet the&s;e things are plainly &s;uppo&s;eable accord|ing to the cour&s;e of nature; which is &s;ufficient. And this may in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;erve to illu&s;trate and verify the ob&s;ervation of Solomon, that the battle is not always to the &s;trong; but that time and chance happen to all. Indeed &s;ome of tho&s;e things which were mentioned under former heads, might be redu|ced to this of time and chance, according to this noti|on of it; particularly winds, weather, &amp;c. under the la&s;t preceeding head: which things are, as to us, con|tingent, accidental or ca&s;ual; no ways dependent up|on human providence and ordination.</P>

<Q>all his works are known from the beginning of the creation?</Q>
Can we think that &s;uch things, which tho' &s;eemingly little in one view of them, yet give &s;uch great turns to the affairs of nations, and are relatively of &s;uch prodigious importance to the world, are accidental with regard to God; or that they happen beyond, or be|&s;ide, his intention! Certainly we cannot, without the greate&s;t impiety, and the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity, in con|junction. No: The le&s;s man has to do in the con|trivance, ordination and production of them, i. e. the more accidental and fortuitous they are with relation to man, the more immediately and directly are they to be attributed to God. The&s;e things, by whatever name or names they are called, are doubtle&s;s ordain|ed by him to be productive of &s;uch and &s;uch con&s;e|quences; and, at the &s;ame time, to confound human pride and arrogance, that no fle&s;h might glory in his &s;ight. In one word, the&s;e are, without all doubt, a very material part of that great plan of divine provi|dence and government, which are carrying on in the world from one age and generation to another.

<P>IT may ju&s;t be added here, that the victory, and with it the civil and religious &s;tate of nations, has &s;ometimes been determined by an unpremeditated re|&s;olution, or a <HI>lucky thought,</HI> as &s;ome would phra&s;e it, coming into the mind of a commander in a deci&s;ive moment, one can hardly tell how.

Of this there have been examples. And to what &s;hall we attribute &s;uch victories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es, but to that providence which &s;uperintends and directs all things; and to the influ|ence of which, even chance and accident are &s;ubject, in accompli&s;hing its own great de&s;igns!</P>

appears that there is ANOTHER, who&s;e right hand, and his holy arm, does, and will, get HIM the victory. We are not to &s;uppo&s;e a fatality in the events of war, incon&s;i&s;tent with any real liberty in man. Nei|ther are we to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e important events are &s;o precarious and fortuitous with re&s;pect to our &s;elves, that we can never form a rational or probable judg|ment concerning them, before-hand. But, accord|ing to rea&s;on, to &s;cripture and experience, the Author and Lord of nature does &s;o over-rule and controul mankind in the exerci&s;e of all their powers and facul|ties (without de&s;troying them); and &s;o order almo&s;t innumerable other things&mdash;every thing indeed, rela|tive to the conduct and i&s;&s;ue of wars, as to hold the&s;e events in his own hand; and to keep men in a conti|nual dependence on him&s;elf. A nation can never be certain of &s;ucce&s;s in war; &s;o many things unexpect|edly intervene from time to time, by God's ordination, to fru&s;trate the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes. And &s;ometimes, on the other hand, contrary to all apparent probability, God &s;upporteth, rai&s;eth, and crowneth with victory, tho&s;e that were ca&s;t down, without &s;trength or &s;pirits, and &s;eemingly on the brink of de&s;truction. That &s;ome nations are in fact thus di&s;appointed and humbled, and others exalted, quite contrary to human probabi|lity, none will deny: And he that will a&s;cribe the&s;e events, ultimately, to any thing el&s;e than to divine providence, has an

<P>SOME of the&s;e la&s;t ob&s;ervations might be, in a mea|&s;ure, exemplified in the turn which the pre&s;ent war has taken within about three years. There has &s;el|dom been &s;o great a change in the face of any war in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace, as this took about that time. In what &s;ea did our fleets, ju&s;t before, &s;upport the ancient ho|nor

of the Briti&s;h flag? Where were not our troops defeated and di&s;graced? What part of our extended frontier in America, was not drenched with blood? What countenances did not appear dejected, except of tho&s;e, who were not the friends, perhaps the enemies, of their country? In what nation were we not become a bye-word and an hi&s;&s;ing? while the very &s;avages de&s;pi&s;ed and in&s;ulted us. How wonderfully is the &s;cene changed &s;ince? Where are not the Briti&s;h fleets and armies now victorious? How many? what important conque&s;ts and acqui&s;itions, have been made? What &s;atisfaction appears in the face of every well-wi&s;her to Great-Britain, and her dependencies? If war, horrid war, can ever wear any other than a hide|hus form, it may now be &s;aid to have put on a &s;miling countenance with re&s;pect to us. But, like the fabled <HI>Janus,</HI> who&s;e temple was always open in a time of war, it has two faces. If with one it &s;miles on us, with the other it certainly frowns on our enemies, par|ticularly here in America. They now feel all that we either felt or fear'd from them heretofore, ex|cepting the effects of &s;avage cruelty and treachery; which God grant they may never feel from the hands of Britons, or Briti&s;h &s;ubjects! Whatever they may de&s;erve, we certainly owe more reverence to our &s;elves, and to human nature, than at once to di&s;ho|nour and deba&s;e both, by retaliating their perfidy and barbarity. This were as much beneath us, and even more, than for a man of virtue and true honor to be|come a common executioner. Such work is fit only for them, and for <HI>him</HI> "who&s;e works they u&s;e to do."</P>
<P>DIVERS things have been mentioned in this di&s;|cour&s;e, as the more immediate, apparent cau&s;es of military &s;ucce&s;&s;es and victories; &s;ometimes one of them, &s;ometimes another, and &s;ometimes &s;everal of
<PB N="32" REF="008668_0030_102FB21610B74818">
them in conjunction; all by the determinate coun&s;el and ordination of heaven. It would be an unnece&s;|&s;ary, perhaps an indecent inquiry, To which of the&s;e things the great change in the face of the pre&s;ent war, and our military &s;ucce&s;&s;es for &s;everal years pa&s;t, have been more e&s;pecially owing? &s;ince this might lead to &s;uch compari&s;ons as ought not to be made. There has, I &s;uppo&s;e, been a co-incidence of &s;everal of the&s;e things, to the production of &s;uch happy and glorious events: Wi&s;dom, and &s;ound policy at the helm: mi|litary &s;kill, &s;pirit and magnanimity in the commanders of our fleets and armies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not, however, without &s;ome exceptions.</NOTE>: courage, di&s;cipline, and martial prowe&s;s in the troops: plenty, health, &amp;c. And what may &s;eem to have had as little hand, per|haps, as any thing, in mo&s;t of our &s;ucce&s;&s;es, is that which was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of accident, or chance. However, this is not to be wholly excluded from having had a &s;hare therein: For in all military affairs and enterprizes, after human policy, wi&s;dom and bravery have done their be&s;t, there will &s;till be &s;omething, more or le&s;s, left to the deci&s;ion of chance; that is, in other words, left to be determined more immediately by the hand and providence of God. Let it &s;uffice, that our &s;ucce&s;&s;es are real and great; and that, by whatever means they have mo&s;t vi&s;ibly been obtained, they are originally from God, to whom the glory of them is therefore due.</P>
<P>I AM, by God's leave and help, in the afternoon to make &s;ome more particular ob&s;ervations and re|flections on our late military &s;ucce&s;&s;es, e&s;pecially in the total reduction of Canada; and al&s;o briefly to con&s;ider, what a&s;pect the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es have upon the enlargement, and more general e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;t's kingdom in the world: which is the grand

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_HAIL, Happy day! and thanks to HIM that made it &s;uch! This is indeed a good day, which the Lord hath made for us to be glad and rejoice therein: A day which, if not many prophets, yet many wi&s;e and righteous men have de&s;ired to &s;ee; and which we their po&s;terity are &s;o highly favoured of God, as now to behold. Let us therefore &s;ing a

new &s;ong unto the Lord, who&s;e right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory; whereby he hath made known his &s;alvation, and &s;hewed his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s to the heathen.</P>
<P>WHEREVER the &s;inging of a new &s;ong is mentioned in &s;cripture, as it is in divers other places, it has a reference to &s;ome very &s;ingular event, by which God manife&s;ts his power and glory; his loving-kindne&s;s to his people, or his ju&s;t &s;everity in the puni&s;hment of their enemies. And it was ob&s;erved to you in the morning, that this pa&s;&s;age, and the p&s;alm in general, has a retro&s;pect to &s;ome remarkable appearances of God's providence in behalf of his people I&s;rael. This is not, however, the ultimate view of the p&s;alm, or of this pa&s;&s;age in particular. It is not merely of the hi&s;torical, but al&s;o of the prophetic kind; looking forward to the great things then, and &s;till future; which are mo&s;t &s;urely to come to pa&s;s in the latter days, under the reign of the Me&s;&s;iah: When God will more &s;ignally di&s;play his &s;alvation, and openly &s;hew his righteou&s;ne&s;s to all the gentile nations;
<Q>giving his &s;on the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</Q>
Agreeably whereto, the apo&s;tle John tells us, that he heard a new &s;ong &s;ung; in which, it &s;eems, the whole rational creation bore a part&mdash;
<Q>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth; and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them, heard I &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb for ever and ever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Rev. v. 9 &mdash; 13.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE text in its ultimate de&s;ign and view, leads our thoughts to the time when this new &s;ong &s;hall be &s;ung, on occa&s;ion of tho&s;e great things and glorious events,
<PB N="37" REF="008668_0035_102FB26A1F2D7DB8">
hereafter to be accompli&s;hed; of which God's mak|ing known his &s;alvation to his people of old, and &s;hewing his righteou&s;ne&s;s to the heathen in, and round about the land of Canaan, was typical, and a kind of pledge. But the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion leads us more par|ticularly to con&s;ider this pa&s;&s;age, as an exhortation to prai&s;e God for the temporal deliverances with which he favours his people, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;es and victories which he grants them over their worldly enemies. However, it was intimated to you, that I &s;hould not quite lo&s;e &s;ight of this pa&s;&s;age con&s;idered in its ultimate de&s;ign, or as having a prophetic reference to the glory of Chri&s;t's kingdom in the latter days: E&s;pecially &s;ince tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es with which God hath lately fa|voured us again&s;t our papal and heathen enemies, may po&s;&s;ibly, or rather probably, be one means of, and a &s;tep towards, the final accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e far greater things which are &s;hortly to come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>THE main bu&s;ine&s;s of my di&s;cour&s;e in the morn|ing, was to illu&s;trate and confirm an important point of doctrine contained in the text: viz. That God is truly the author of all our deliverances from, &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es again&s;t, and victories over, our worldly enemies. His right hand, and his holy arm, &s;aith the p&s;almi&s;t, hath gotten him the victory, &amp;c. This is indeed the foundation of all our <HI>religious</HI> joy and gratitude on &s;uch occa&s;ions as the pre&s;ent. It was therefore thought proper to enlarge upon this point. And ac|cordingly we traced &s;ome of the foot-&s;teps of divine providence, and the various methods of its operation, in giving &s;alvation and victory to tho&s;e whom it fa|vours; and in accompli&s;hing its own great de&s;igns. But having already &s;aid what may &s;erve in &s;ome mea&s;ure to clear up and e&s;tabli&s;h this important prin|ciple of natural and revealed religion; and al&s;o made &s;ome &s;hort, general reflexions on our late military

&s;ucce&s;&s;es: It will now be proper to take a nearer, and more particular view of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, e&s;peci|ally here in America, in the reduction of Canada; which, you are &s;en&s;ible, is the principal occa&s;ion of our appearing before God this day to &s;ing a new &s;ong of prai&s;e to him. However, &s;ome other &s;ucce&s;&s;es with which God hath lately favoured the Briti&s;h arms in other parts, will not be wholly omitted.</P>
<P>SOME of my hearers may probably remember, that on the day of our public thank&s;giving the la&s;t year on the &s;urrender of Quebec, the capital of Canada, I con&s;idered the importance of that acqui&s;ition, not &s;o much in it&s;elf, as with reference to what might proba|bly be the con&s;equence thereof another campaign, viz. the intire reduction of the whole country: Some of the happy effects whereof were then repre&s;ented to you, upon a pre&s;umption that this mu&s;t be the con&s;e|quence of that acqui&s;ition, with the ordinary ble&s;&s;ing of providence on the Briti&s;h arms; or unle&s;s &s;ome|thing out of the common cour&s;e of things, &s;hould in|tervene to prevent it. I now heartily congratulate you, my friends and brethren here pre&s;ent, and ble&s;s the great, the eternal God, who pre&s;ides over nations and their affairs, that he has not fru&s;trated tho&s;e our hopes; but fulfilled and realized them, in &s;ome re&s;|pects even beyond what we could have rea&s;onably expected. But having heretofore con&s;idered the &s;ur|render of Quebec in connexion with the &s;uppo&s;ed re|duction of Canada, as the natural con&s;equence; and &s;poken &s;omewhat particularly of the advantages which mu&s;t re&s;ult to Great-Britain and her colonies from &s;uch a conque&s;t; you are &s;en&s;ible that I have hereby in &s;ome mea&s;ure anticipated the joy and gratitude of this day; and precluded my&s;elf from &s;aying divers things, which might otherwi&s;e have been proper on
<PB N="39" REF="008668_0037_102FB26BD89B7810">
the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion: I mean, unle&s;s I &s;hould go into a repetition of the &s;ame things; of which I am not fond.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, &s;ince it is proper to &s;ay &s;omething par|ticularly upon this conque&s;t, in order to excite our gratitudge to the &s;upreme Governor of the world, from whom &s;alvation and victory come; I &s;hall not &s;crupulou&s;ly avoid every thing that was mentioned on the occa&s;ion afore&s;aid: But, touching briefly on tho&s;e things which were then chiefly enlarged upon, I &s;hall now &s;peak more e&s;pecially of &s;uch as neither were, nor could be, taken notice of at that time, without the &s;pirit of prophecy.</P>
<P>LET us then con&s;ider the compleatne&s;s of this conque&s;t; the great importance of it to Great-Bri|tain and her American colonies; the little lo&s;s of men with which it has been effected; and &s;ome of the foot-&s;teps of providence therein. After which, we will take a cur&s;ory notice of &s;ome other of our military &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;ince the time of our la&s;t public and general thank&s;giving: All which together, afford us the agreeable hopes of &s;eeing the pre&s;ent calamitous war &s;oon brought to a happy period, and demand our mo&s;t grateful acknowledgments to the God of armies.</P>
<P>WE may now, with the greate&s;t propriety, con&s;ider the conqu&s;t of Canada as compleated. The French no longer hold a &s;ingle &s;ort, garri&s;on, or fortified place, in that country; but there has been a formal &s;urren|der of the whole by the governor-general thereof to the Briti&s;h commander; the principal parts whereof had indeed before been brought under, and &s;ubdued by force of arms. From what we have already heard, it may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that the far greater part of the inhabitants of New France are before this time become Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; having taken an oath of allegiance
<PB N="40" REF="008668_0038_102FB2222F89DC60">
at lea&s;t of fidelity, to his Maje&s;ty: While the regular troops and marine companies of France, with all officers civil and military, and other per&s;ons of any di&s;tinction who might promote di&s;turbances, are em|barked, or embarking, for their mother country. The Briti&s;h troops are actually in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all places and po&s;ts of any con&s;equence, &s;uch as they de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s; and in &s;ufficient numbers.

<P>THEY who are acquainted with the geography of North-America, may po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e that the re|duction of Montreal and Canada might have been &s;ooner, and more certainly effected, by one grand army by the way of St. Lawrence, than by &s;everal &s;maller ones, conducted thro' &s;uch tedious and diffi|cult routs as tho&s;e of the lakes; e&s;pecially that of lake Ontario. But there are now probably none but what are convinced, that the plan which has been laid and pur&s;ued, was, upon the whole, far the be&s;t. The general, by thus dividing his army, and coming again&s;t the enemy on all &s;ides, hemm'd them in, prevented their e&s;caping, or di&s;per&s;ing here and there in &s;mall parties; and &s;o has accompli&s;hed the whole bu&s;ine&s;s at once. Whereas, had they been attacked only by the way of St. Lawrence by one grand army, they would doubtle&s;s have abandon'd Montreal at its ap|proach; retreated together up the river, where they could hardly have been pur&s;ued, or el&s;e gone off in parties to the &s;outhward and we&s;tward, and otherways, with their arms. So that tho' Montreal had been in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, yet the country might in effect have remained &s;till un&s;ubdued.

<P>BUT when I &s;peak of the importance of this ac|qui&s;ition, you will doubtle&s;s ob&s;erve, that I go wholly upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that it will be retained.

But while things continue in &s;uch a po&s;ture as they are at pre&s;ent thro' the goodne&s;s of God; while we have &s;o fair a pro&s;pect of having it in our power, as we &s;hall on that &s;uppo&s;ion certainly have a right, to in&s;i&s;t upon indemnification for the immen&s;e expence of trea&s;ure and blood, to which the ambition and inju&s;tice of France has lately put us, as al&s;o upon &s;ecurity for the future to the&s;e American colonies: while we have &s;uch a pro&s;pect, I &s;ay, I thought it hardly decent to make the &s;uppo&s;ition of Canada's ever being deli|vered up to France; which might be looked upon as a kind of trea&s;on.

<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time, one of our admirals <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Ed.

The Bri|ti&s;h admiral's falling in with this fleet, was mo&s;t oppor|tune and &s;ea&s;onable for us, as it was unexpected to the enemy. The French fleet was going to take un|der her convoy a large number of tran&s;ports lying rea|dy in different ports, after having gotten out of Bre&s;t by &s;tealth while the Briti&s;h fleet was withdrawn. And indeed the latter did not again &s;ail from its port in the Engli&s;h channel, 'till the very day the other &s;tole out; a circum&s;tance not unworthy of notice, &s;ince, humanly &s;peaking, the French fleet had a fair pro&s;pect of reach|ing its port, or ports, before it could be overtaken. And this it had probably done, had not an inferior En|gli&s;h &s;quadron fallen in its way, by which means it was retarded for &s;ome time. This fleet was &s;o infe|rior to the French, that it mu&s;t in all probability have fallen an ea&s;y conque&s;t thereto. But at the in|&s;tant when &s;o unequal an engagement was to begin, appeared admiral HAWKE with the Briti&s;h flag, and a formidable fleet: Which not only made the enemy glad to quit their de&s;tin'd prey, but &s;truck them with &s;uch terror, as even render'd them incapable of a pru|dent and &s;ucce&s;sful flight. Thus was the little Engli&s;h &s;quadron at once pre&s;erved; the de&s;ign of the French fleet rendered abortive; the great preparations of the enemy for a de&s;cent, in&s;ignificant; and their mo&s;t pow|erful fleet di&s;graced and ruined upon their own coa&s;ts: A mortifying &s;pectacle to the people! And upon the whole, this &s;eems to have been almo&s;t a fini&s;hing blow to the marine, and naval power of France, before re|duced &s;o low by repeated di&s;a&s;ters and lo&s;&s;es.

<P>BUT having thus reminded you of tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es with which God has lately favoured the Briti&s;h arms, more e&s;pecially in the conque&s;t of Canada; all which &s;eem to promi&s;e an honorable peace, future &s;e|curity to us here in America, and many advantages both to Great-Britain and her colonies; and which therefore demand our grateful prai&s;es to the &s;upreme Governor of the world: Having done this, I &s;ay, let us now proceed, as was propo&s;ed, briefly to con&s;ider, what a&s;pect the&s;e victories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es have upon the kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; its farther exten|&s;ion, and the accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e glorious things which are to come to pa&s;s in the latter days.</P>

in him a littlene&s;s and narrowne&s;s of mind, and a want of due regard to, and zeal for, the honour of God, or the intere&s;t of religion in the world. It would al&s;o be treating his auditors as if he &s;uppo&s;ed them wholly immer&s;ed in worldly cares, without a thought of any thing greater or better than a &s;hort-liv'd pro&s;perity here below; which, I per&s;uade my|&s;elf, is not the character of tho&s;e to whom I am &s;peaking.

<P>NOW there are two things to be laid down here, as principles on which to proceed, they being cer|tainly and plainly foretold in the holy &s;criptures. One is, That God will at length in a mo&s;t wonder|ful manner bring down, humble, and even de&s;troy, that corrupt and apo&s;tate, that idolatrous and per|&s;ecuting church, variou&s;ly de&s;cribed in the holy &s;criptures; particularly under the character of a woman, "having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthine&s;s of her fornica|tions. And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev.

XIX. 2.</NOTE>&mdash;"And in her was found the blood of pro|phets, and of &s;aints, and of all that were &s;lain upon the earth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cha. XVIII. 24.</NOTE> That that apo&s;tate, antichri&s;tian church, or kingdom, which is thus emblematically de&s;cribed, is to have her plagues made wonderful, and to be finally brought to ruin, is mo&s;t manife&s;t from the &s;acred &s;criptures. Nor can prote&s;tants in this age, one would think, be at any great lo&s;s, what church, or where &s;he is&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="008668_0052_102FB293810D8FD0">THE other thing alluded to above, is, That the go&s;pel of the kingdom is not only to be "preached for a witne&s;s" among all nations, but to be actually e&s;tabli&s;hed thro'out the world, among&s;t Jews and Gentiles. For "the kingdoms of this world are to become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t; and he &s;hall reign forever and ever."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rev.

<P>NOW we may con&s;ider the great &s;ucce&s;&s;es which God has given to the Briti&s;h arms in the pre&s;ent war, as tending, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to the accompli&s;hment of both the&s;e events; the de&s;truction of the papal power, and the e&s;tabli&s;hing of chri&s;tianity thro'out the world.</P>
<P>FOR fir&s;t, as to the former of them: The&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es have been obtained by a prote&s;tant king and nation, again&s;t the greate&s;t and mo&s;t powerful na|tion in the communion of the church of Rome. The French monarch is unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t po|tent of tho&s;e kings who have "given their kingdom unto the bea&s;t." But his power is now much di|mini&s;hed, and &s;eems in a fair way to be farther re|duced. And this will be in effect dimini&s;hing that of the roman pontiff. Every new acce&s;&s;ion of power to our own, and to other prote&s;tant kings and &s;tates, will al&s;o tend to the reduction of that of Rome. It may be farther ob&s;erved here, that as learning in|crea&s;es, and runs to and fro in the earth, the influence and authority of the pope declines, as the natural and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence thereof: And it is now
<PB N="55" REF="008668_0053_102FB28451DD2E60">
far le&s;s, even in mo&s;t or all roman catholic countries, than it was &s;ome centuries &s;ince. It has declined fa&s;t &s;ince the beginning of the reformation; when, and &s;ince, divers kings and nations, and our own among the fir&s;t, came to an open rupture with the pope; utterly di&s;owning his juri&s;diction over them. The king of Portugal has al&s;o lately come to &s;uch a rupture with him, as is not likely to be &s;oon healed; and as may, not improbably, i&s;&s;ue in the pope's lo&s;ing forever all authority in that kingdom, how|ever devoted the common people may be to him at pre&s;ent. Nor would it be very &s;trange if the king of Spain &s;hould &s;oon break with him al&s;o: Since the je&s;uits, mo&s;t probably with the pope's conni|vance, if not by his direction, have been plotting a|gain&s;t that crown, as well as the king of Portugal; and have actually been carrying on a war again&s;t the &s;ubjects of both, in South America. But be that as it will, it &s;eems morally impo&s;&s;ible, con&s;ider|ing the progre&s;s which learning has made, and is &s;till making, but that the eyes of all the kings, &s;tates, and people in general, now in the communion of the church of Rome, mu&s;t before long be opened. And when they &s;hall plainly &s;ee, how gro&s;ly they have been deluded, and how impudently tyrannized over by her, they will of cour&s;e become her enraged ene|mies; and be avenged on her, as many have been already. For, in the language of in&s;piration,
<Q>The&s;e &s;hall hate the whore, and &s;hall make her de&s;olate, and naked, and &s;hall eat her fle&s;h, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their king|dom unto the bea&s;t, until the words of God &s;hall be fulfilled. And the woman which thou &s;awe&s;t, is that great city, which reigneth over the king's of the earth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. XVII. 16.17.18.</NOTE></Q>&mdash;This remarkable prophecy is
<PB N="56" REF="008668_0054_102FB285D5C91A48">
partly fulfilled already, in the breaking off of &s;o many kings and &s;tates from the church of Rome; and their becoming enemies, and &s;ore &s;courges to her pride and impiety; of which nations our own is the principal. And we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that this prediction &s;hall in the whole of it, and po&s;&s;ibly be|fore long, be punctually accompli&s;hed. In the pro&s;pect of which final ruin coming upon the great whore, or my&s;tical Babylon, the apo&s;tle John broke forth thus&mdash;<Q>Rejoice over her thou heaven, and ye holy apo&s;tles and prophets; for God hath aveng|ed you on her.

<P>BUT &s;econdly, as to the propagation and e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the go&s;pel among&s;t all nations: Our mili|tary &s;ucce&s;&s;es may be con&s;idered as one &s;tep towards the accompli&s;hing of that great event al&s;o.

<P>THERE are many heathen here in America, who have long had &s;ome intercour&s;e both with Us and
<PB N="57" REF="008668_0055_102FB28D6B091AE8">
the French. We have heretofore made attempts, by the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven to "turn them from dark|ne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan unto God." But the&s;e our attempts have not been at|tended with any great &s;ucce&s;s; with le&s;s indeed, than the endeavours of the French mi&s;&s;ionaries, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, to make them apo&s;tatize from heathen|i&s;m to popery. Many di&s;couragements and ob&s;ta|cles have been in the way hitherto; &s;ome of which are now removed. And there &s;eems to be a fairer pro&s;pect, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, of doing &s;ome|thing con&s;iderable to this end, than ever there has been in times pa&s;t; provided there be wi&s;dom, in conjunction with a proper zeal, in undertaking and pro&s;ecuting &s;o good a de&s;ign. God hath in &s;ome &s;en&s;e already made known his &s;alvation, and openly &s;hewed his righteou&s;ne&s;s in the &s;ight of the&s;e hea|then, by the victories, and great &s;ucce&s;&s;es which he hath given us over our enemies in the&s;e parts. So that we may &s;uppo&s;e, they will be under le&s;s tempta|tion to &s;ay now, than heretofore, "Where is their God?" The prejudices which many of them have imbibed again&s;t us and our religion, by means of the French mi&s;&s;ionaries repre&s;enting all prote&s;tants to them, as bad or wor&s;e than athei&s;ts, may now in &s;ome mea&s;ure be abated: At lea&s;t we &s;hall have a better opportunity, and greater advantages, for re|moving the&s;e prejudices, than formerly; and to convince all tho&s;e pagans who have had any know|ledge of Us and of the French, that our God is indeed in heaven; and that it is no other than he, who&s;e right hand, and his holy arm hath given us, or ra|ther gotten to him&s;elf, the victory. They will pro|bably be influenced in &s;ome degree to think favour|ably of us and our religion, by our great &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and triumphs over tho&s;e who have ever repre&s;ent|ed
<PB N="58" REF="008668_0056_102FB299D490DCB0">
us as the enemies of the true God; and to who&s;e vain boa&s;ts of their being his peculiar favourites, to who&s;e threatnings again&s;t us, and repeated con&s;tant treacheries, they have been no &s;trangers; and many of them indeed, the in&s;truments of their wicked and villainous de&s;igns.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e things it may be added, that the&s;e nu|merous tribes of heathen, when they find them&s;elves wholly dependent upon us, as they mu&s;t be, will probably become in all re&s;pects more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and tractable than they u&s;ed to be, either to us or to the French, in times pa&s;t. They could formerly change &s;ides, and run from one to the other on any trifling occa&s;ion; and held, as it were, the ballance of power between us in their own hands. In the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances they thought they had a right to be courted by both, as they actually were: Which made them, if po&s;&s;ible, more proud, in&s;olent and barbarous than they naturally are, as well as indocile to the la&s;t degree. But their having now only one European people on which to depend for nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, if a rea&s;onable, ju&s;t and wi&s;e u&s;e is made of this advantage, it will without doubt give us &s;uch an a&s;cendency over them, as will greatly facilitate the work of humanizing and chri&s;tianizing them.</P>
<P>WE find, agreeably to what has been &s;aid above, that the Six Nations are within a few years become more tractable than they u&s;ed to be; I mean, &s;ince they have &s;een the French power upon the decline here, and in a fair way to be entirely de&s;troyed. Tho&s;e of them who attended general AMHERST in|to Canada, it is &s;aid, were very docile, &s;ubject to di&s;cipline and command. Yea, they were tutor'd by him into &s;ome regard to clemency and mercy;
<PB N="59" REF="008668_0057_102FB29BE337EA38">
to which they were heretofore almo&s;t intire &s;tran|gers. We are informed, that when they had taken &s;everal hundred pri&s;oners on Montreal, who expect|ed nothing but to die in tortures, the &s;avages re|lieved their anxiety by telling them, their orders were, not to put any of their captives to death; tho', as they added, the French u&s;ed to order their In|dians to kill all that fell into their hands. A ju&s;t and &s;evere reproach; which &s;hews, we need not de&s;pair of humanizing and chri&s;tianizing the American &s;avages; and which mu&s;t have &s;tung their pri&s;oners to the &s;oul, if they were not pa&s;t feeling! And how agree|able? how edifying mu&s;t it have been, to hear tho&s;e &s;avages thus reproaching the&s;e good catholic chri&s;|tians, the &s;ubjects of his <HI>mo&s;t chri&s;tian</HI> maje&s;ty, for their barbarity; and trying as it were, by their own better example, to infu&s;e into them &s;ome &s;en&s;e of humanity! And, by the way, it may be hoped that the French them&s;elves who &s;hall remain in Canada, or at lea&s;t their po&s;terity, will become prote&s;tants, provided prudent and proper methods, con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice and humanity, are taken to make them &s;o.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee from what has been &s;aid, that we have now more encouragement than ever to attempt the chri&s;tianizing the American heathen; &s;ome of the ob&s;tacles thereto being removed by the late &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his Maje&s;ty's arms. And were this ac|compli&s;hed, it would be at once a con&s;iderable en|largement of Chri&s;t's kingdom, and partly the ac|compli&s;hment of that promi&s;e, that the <HI>uttermo&s;t</HI> parts of the earth &s;hould be his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Our &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the Ea&s;t Indies, and the growth of our &s;ettlements there, where the natives are &s;till more numerous, and le&s;s &s;avage than in America, bids fair to be a means in time of &s;preading chri&s;tianity

in tho&s;e parts al&s;o&mdash;And upon the whole (for I may not enlarge) if we attentively look round the world; if we con&s;ider the increa&s;e of knowledge, both reli|gious and natural, ever &s;ince the reformation began; and that it is growing more and common in all civilized nations, whereas it u&s;ed before to be con|fined to a few per&s;ons; if we reflect on the drop|ping off of one kingdom and &s;tate after another from the church of Rome; if we con&s;ider the great increa&s;e of navigation and commerce, carried on from Europe into all parts of the known world, more e&s;pecially by prote&s;tant nations; and the many factories, &s;ettlements and colonies from chri&s;tendom, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the mo&s;t remote countries; if we re|flect on the&s;e things, I &s;ay, not to mention any thing at pre&s;ent of the order of the prophecies, there &s;eems to be &s;ome rea&s;on to hope the time is not far di&s;tant, when both the roman papacy &s;hall come to nothing, and the go&s;pel &s;hall be propagated throughout the world; the knowledge of God co|vering the whole earth as the waters cover the &s;eas. Though, by the way, whenever the&s;e things &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, whether &s;ooner or later, they will not probably be effected wholly by natural and hu|man means: But by them in conjunction with the extraordinary effu&s;ion of the Holy Spirit, with the mo&s;t &s;igna!, undeniable manife&s;tations of God's power and grace in favour of his true wor&s;hippers, and the equally vi&s;ible manife&s;tations of his wrath, and righteous di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t others; e&s;pecially tho&s;e who wilfully uphold errors and corruptions in his church: For this is undeniably the &s;cripture account of the matter. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Some of the ob&s;tacles hitherto in the way of go&s;pelizing the &s;avage nations in North America being now removed, it may be hoped that the right honourable and reverend SOCIETY <HI>for propagating the go&s;pel in foreign parts,</HI> will, among&s;t other objects of their charitable attention, hereafter make this a <HI>principal</HI> one.

the mountains &s;hake with the &s;welling thereof&mdash; There is a river, the &s;treams whereof &s;hall make glad the city of God; the holy place of the taber|nacles of the mo&s;t High. God is in the mid&s;t of her; &s;he &s;hall not be moved: God &s;hall help her, and that right early." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm XLVI.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHILE we prai&s;e God for the late favourable, and very &s;ignal appearances of his providence, in cau&s;ing us to &s;ee our de&s;ire upon our enemies, we &s;hould beware of every thing that has a tendency to fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of his goodne&s;s towards us, and to turn his ble&s;&s;ings into cur&s;es; particularly of pride, effeminacy and luxury. The&s;e are commonly the attendants of peace, outward pro&s;perity, riches and &s;ecurity; and therefore ought to be particularly guarded again&s;t. When Je&s;hurun of old waxed fat, then he kicked, and forgat the God that "rode up|on the heavens in his help, and in his excellency up|on the &s;ky." And thus it often comes to pa&s;s, that even the pro&s;perity of fools de&s;troyeth them. All hi&s;tory, ancient and modern, &s;acred and profane, is a proof of the&s;e things; and &s;hould &s;erve for a warning to us. The Per&s;ians, Greeks and Romans, among&s;t innumerable other nations, were &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly examples of the fatal con&s;equences of great pro&s;|perity without wi&s;dom and virtue.</P>
<P>DURING the time of ancient Carthage, the only dangerous neighbour and rival of Rome, when the conque&s;t of the former was meditated by the latter, there was a debate in the roman &s;enate, whether this were expedient or not, if practicable. While &s;ome thought it would be equally glorious and hap|hay for Rome to cru&s;h the only dangerous rival of
<PB N="65" REF="008668_0063_102FB2AF38A18348">
her power and greatne&s;s, others were apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences thereof. They feared le&s;t they &s;hould by means of &s;uch a conque&s;t, and the peace, wealth and &s;ecurity naturally following, become luxurious, effeminate and corrupt, to their own de|&s;truction in the end. This proved no imaginary or groundle&s;s fear: When Carthage was no more, and Rome had &s;ubdued all her neighbouring enemies, &s;he &s;eemed indeed for a while to be more happy than ever: But in proce&s;s of time, riches and &s;ecu|rity produced the mo&s;t fatal effects; the mo&s;t ex|travagant luxury, venality, and a total depravation of manners. And when her citizens had no longer any foreign enemy to fear, they fell into violent factions, contentions, and civil wars. They lo&s;t their liberty in the end; became wretched by means of their own pro&s;perity and greatne&s;s; and &s;o the roman power was de&s;troyed. Thus did luxury, the mo&s;t formidable enemy to any &s;tate when it becomes common, invade and triumph over ancient Rome, which had triumphed over all her other enemies; hereby fully revenging on her, not only the fall of Carthage, but of a conquer'd world. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash;Saevior armis</L>

<P>SOMETHING not wholly unlike to this, may po&s;|&s;ibly befall us in time, the American Carthage being &s;ubdued, unle&s;s God &s;hould give us the wi&s;dom to avoid tho&s;e rocks and &s;helves on which &s;o many have &s;plit, and &s;uffered a wretched &s;hipwrack. Di|vine providence has &s;et up beacons and land-marks in every age and quarter of the world for our warn|ing and direction; and if we do not take due no|tice of them, our de&s;truction will be almo&s;t certain,

while, as an aggravation of it, we &s;hall have no claim even to pity.</P>
<P>BUT to draw to a conclu&s;ion: While we ble&s;s God for our repeated and great &s;ucce&s;&s;es again&s;t our heathen, and other idolatrous enemies, let us take heed that we our&s;elves do not depart from the plain, &s;imple doctrine and wor&s;hip of the go&s;pel, or con|form to any of the corrupt principles and modes of wor&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world. We ought not to leave the clear light of revelation, and the "&s;ure word of prophecy," to run after the <HI>ignes fatui</HI> of human creeds, which appeared in the dark and cor|rupt times of the church, and have ever &s;ince con|tributed more or le&s;s to mi&s;lead the chri&s;tian world. It becomes us to adhere to the holy &s;criptures as our only rule of faith and practice, di&s;cipline and wor|&s;hip. The "mother of harlots" has many daugh|ters in chri&s;tendom; "all nations have drank" more or le&s;s,
<Q>of the wine of the wrath of her for|nication.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Revel. XVIII. 3.</NOTE></Q> There has indeed been a great re|formation in many nations from &s;ome of the gro&s;&s;er errors, &s;uper&s;titions and corruptions introduced by the papacy, and &s;till upheld in the church of Rome. But in what country, in what nation, is the refor|mation complete? In what national, or even pro|vincial church, are not &s;ome of the&s;e errors and cor|ruptions found? It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that immediately after St. John heard a mighty angel pronounce the fall and utter ruin of my&s;tical Baby|lon, he

apo&s;tacy, &s;eriou&s;ly to attend to this divine admoni|tion. There is ONE who walketh in the mid&s;t of the golden candle&s;ticks, holding the &s;tars in his right hand; who&s;e eyes are as a flame of fire, and his voice as the &s;ound of many waters:
<Q>And all the churches &s;hall know,</Q> &s;aith he, <Q>that I am he which &s;earcheth the reins and hearts; and I will give unto every one of you according to his works.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev.

And altho' the&s;e errors and corruptions are perhaps even gloried in by &s;ome churches as their di&s;tingui&s;hing ornaments and excellencies, the breath of the Lord &s;hall one day puff them all away like chaff and rubbi&s;h, with the <HI>wilful</HI> authors and upholders of them, to be con|&s;umed in the fire of his indignation. They alone, who wor&s;hip the FATHER in &s;pirit and in truth, &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed. Chri&s;tianity, long ob&s;cur'd and di&s;graced by the additions which human pride, hu|man folly and wickedne&s;s, have made to it, &s;hall at length be re&s;tored to its primitive &s;implicity, beauty and glory, and become a prai&s;e in the whole earth. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>We have Mo&s;es and the prophets, and apo&s;tles, and the word of Chri&s;t him&s;elf; and if we will not hear them, we &s;hall be more inexcu&s;able than the Jews.

And the giving ear to the prophets is a <HI>fundamental character of the true church.</HI>&mdash;The authority of emperors, kings and princes is human. The authority of councils, &s;ynods, bi&s;hops, and pre&s;byters, is human. The authority of the prophets is divine, and comprehends the &s;um of religion, reckoning Mo&s;es and the apo&s;tles among&s;t the prophets.

<P><Q>The event of things predicted many ages before, will then be a convincing argument that the world is governed by providence.
