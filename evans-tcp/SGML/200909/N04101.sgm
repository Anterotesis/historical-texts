<BIBL>EZEKIEL XXXVI. 37.</BIBL>
<Q>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Prophecies contained in this Chapter may relate to the Deliverance of God's ancient People out of the Babyloni&s;h Captivity; but then, they doubtle&s;s look further, and may refer to the Calling of the <HI>Jews;</HI> yea to the flouri&s;hing State of the whole <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of God. Here are temporal, but e&s;pecially &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed. And it is &s;aid that God would do the&s;e great Things for them in An&s;wer to Prayer. God had before put his People in Mind of their own great Unworthine&s;s, and declar'd that he would not do this for their Sakes, but for his holy Name's Sake: However, he would be enquired of by the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to do it for them. The Words may imply a <HI>Command,</HI> that God required his People to &s;eek him for the Accompli&s;hment of the&s;e precious Promi&s;es. They may al&s;o comprehend in them a <HI>fur|ther Promi&s;e,</HI> that God would put it into their Hearts,
<PB N="6" REF="005055_0004_1016925BC938B3D8">
and incline them thus to enquire after him. The Word here u&s;ed is ob&s;erved to &s;ignify their &s;eeking and inqui|ring with all Diligence. The Words may al&s;o imply that GOD would manife&s;t him&s;elf ready to be found of them&dagger;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Inveniendum me exhibebo. <HI>Pi&s;cator.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>GOD will be enquired of, and &s;ought unto by his People, to be&s;tow the Ble&s;&s;ings which he hath pro|mi&s;ed to them in his Word.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. GOD hath in his Word promi&s;ed to be&s;tow all needed Ble&s;&s;ings upon his People.</P>
<P N="2">II. GOD will be enquired of and &s;ought unto by his People, to be&s;tow the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings upon them.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>GOD hath in his Word promi&s;ed to be&s;tow all needed Ble&s;&s;ings upon his People.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Bible</HI> we have the great <HI>Charter</HI> of God's Covenant People, in which is contained, and confirmed to the Faithful all tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, which God is pleas'd of his free Grace, through the Merits of Chri&s;t, to con|fer upon them, 2 Pet. 1. 3, 4. <HI>According as his di|vine Power hath given unto us <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. Things that pertain unto Life and Godline&s;s, through the Knowledge of him that hath call'd us to Glory and Virtue: Whereby are given unto <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> exceeding great and precious Promi&s;es; that by the&s;e you might be Partakers of the divine Nature, having e&s;caped the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that is in the World through Lu&s;t.</HI> That Godline&s;s which is taught and pre&s;s'd upon us in the Word, is profitable to all Things, having Promi&s;e of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come. But the De&s;ign of our pre&s;ent Meeting leads me to &s;peak of &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, which if we obtain, other Things &s;hall
<PB N="7" REF="005055_0005_1016925E6E7518D0">
be added, &s;o far as God &s;hall &s;ee the&s;e to be truly Good for his People. And here, I would con&s;ider &s;ome of the &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings which are promi&s;ed to God's People in this Chapter, for which God declareth he will he en|quired of.&mdash;Ver. 25. <HI>Then will I &s;prinkle clean Water upon you, and ye &s;hall be clean.</HI>&mdash;God here a&s;&s;ureth his People that by his Word and Spirit, He would apply the Virtues of the Blood of Je&s;us, that Blood of Sprink|ling, to wa&s;h them from the Guilt and Defilements of Sin. The Blood of Chri&s;t the then promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, is the Blood of Atonement, and it <HI>clean&s;eth from all Sin.</HI> ver. 26. <HI>A new Heart al&s;o will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take the &s;tony Heart out of your Fle&s;h, and I will give you an Heart of Fle&s;h.</HI> God here promi&s;eth that he would &s;avingly con|vert them, and form in them a new Frame, and excel|lent Di&s;po&s;ition in &s;piritual qualities: He would renew his Image upon them in Knowledge, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s. Thus they &s;hould be made new Creatures in a &s;piritual Sen&s;e; old Things &s;hould pa&s;s away, and all Things become new. God promi&s;eth al&s;o to take away the <HI>&s;tony Heart</HI> which was hard and in&s;en&s;ible, and re|fus'd to yield to good Impre&s;&s;ions. And in Oppo&s;ition to that evil Heart, God would give a &s;oft and tender Heart which like living Fle&s;h is quick and &s;en&s;ible, and ready to yield to the living Soul that animates it. In like Manner God's People being quickned and governed by the Spirit, &s;hould be ready to receive Impre&s;&s;ions from him. Agreeably it follows 27 Ver. <HI>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cau&s;e you to walk in his Statutes, and ye &s;hall keep my Judgments, and do them.</HI> God would not only &s;end his Spirit to &s;trive with them; but he would effectually be&s;tow him upon them, and &s;end him to dwell in their Hearts by his &s;aving Operations as a renewing &s;anctifying and comforting Spirit, by whom God commu|nicateth all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings to his People. And to crown all, God &s;ays 28 Ver. <HI>And ye &s;hall dwell in the Land</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="005055_0006_1016925FFA9DA168">
<HI>that I gave to your Fathers, and ye &s;hall be my People, and I will be your God.</HI> God would enable them to di&s;charge the Duties of their Covenant-Relation to him, and he would fulfil his Part in giving them the &s;ure Mercies of the new Covenant; he would ble&s;s them as their Cove|nant God with all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly Things in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. This then is all our Salvation, and &s;hould be all our De&s;ire, even to inherit the great and good Things contained in the Promi&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>I proceed to &s;hew that God will be enquired of, and &s;ought unto hy his People, to be&s;tow the&s;e promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ings upon them.</HI></P>
<P>We may under this Head &s;peak to the following Things. 1. What's implied in our inquiring of God and &s;eeking him for the Ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed in his Word. 2. How and after what Manner &s;hould we attend this Duty? 3. We may con&s;ider our Obligations thus to enquire of the Lord.</P>
<P N="1">I. What is implied <HI>in our inquiring of God to be&s;tow the&s;e promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ings upon us?</HI></P>
<P>A. In general, That in the Ways of God's Appointment we &s;eek the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, and wait upon God for them.</P>
<P>More particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It &s;uppo&s;eth a reali&s;ing Apprehen&s;ion of our Need of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, and that God alone is able to be&s;tow them.</HI></P>
<P>Men will not be &s;olicitous to enquire after that which they imagine they have in Hand, or do not need. When therefore the <HI>Laodiceans</HI> pre&s;um'd that they were rich, and had Need of nothing; our Saviour fir&s;t declared to them, that they were upon &s;piritual Accounts wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked; and then coun&s;els them <HI>to come to him for Gold tried in the Fire,</HI>&mdash;Rev. 3. 17, 18. If we are not &s;en&s;ible of our &s;piritual Maladies; we &s;hall not &s;eek after God to clean&s;e and heal
<PB N="9" REF="005055_0007_10169261D6787CB8">
our Souls. If we are not &s;en&s;ible how we are become guilty before God, and obnoxious to his Wrath and Cur&s;e as Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the Law; we &s;hall not with any due Concern enquire after Chri&s;t, and &s;eek an Intere&s;t in him as the Lord our <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> If we are not &s;en&s;ible of our being empty of Grace, and of our Need of it; we &s;hall never go to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that of his Fulne&s;s we may receive and Grace for Grace. Unle&s;s we &s;ee and feel our Need of the gracious Influences of the Spirit to renew us, and change our Hearts; we &s;hall not in a due Manner a&s;k this great Gift of God. In a Word, We mu&s;t behold God as the God of all Grace, and Father of Mercies in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; or we &s;hall not leave our broken Ci&s;terns to go to him as the Fountain of living Waters, for all needed Supplies. Agreeably when God was about to invite his People to return to him as their only Saviour, he &s;ays to them, Ho&s;ea 13. 9. <HI>O I&s;rael thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy &s;elf, but in me is thine Help.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It intends <HI>that we Value and De&s;ire the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings as the be&s;t Things.</HI></P>
<P>In Order to our &s;earching after any Ble&s;&s;ing, we mu&s;t have a due Value for it, and De&s;ires after it excited in us. Prov. 18. 1. <HI>Through De&s;ire a Man having &s;epara|ted him&s;elf, &s;eeketh and intermedleth with all Wi&s;dom.</HI> Would we then enquire of God concerning &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings? We mu&s;t count them to be the mo&s;t excellent Things, &amp; accordingly &s;earch for them as for hid Trea&s;ures. We mu&s;t e&s;teem the Promi&s;es to be exceeding great and precious, and earne&s;tly de&s;ire the good contained in them. We mu&s;t open our Mouths wide, enlarge our De&s;ires, that we may be filled. Thus do we &s;eek the Lord as our God? We mu&s;t thir&s;t for him. P&s;alm 63. 1 &mdash;3. <HI>O God, thou art my God, early will I &s;eek thee: my Soul thir&s;teth for thee, my Fle&s;h longeth for thee in a dry and thir&s;ty Land, where no Water is: To &s;ee thy Power and thy Glory, &s;o as I have &s;een thee in the Sanctuary. Becau&s;e thy loving Kindne&s;s is better than Life.</HI> We mu&s;t count
<PB N="10" REF="005055_0008_101692641EBA3218">
all Things but Lo&s;s for the Excellency of the Knowlege of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and that we may be found in him; or we &s;hall not &s;eek him in a right Manner. And as the Gift of the Holy Spirit virtually contains all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, we mu&s;t value and de&s;ire this above all temporal good Things. That Invitation is made to &s;uch. I&s;a. 55. 1. <HI>Ho, every one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money; come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy Wine and Milk without Money, and without Price.</HI> And the Pro|mi&s;e is indeed made to them, Matth. 5. 6. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they which do hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s: for they &s;hall be filled.</HI> And without this Value for and De&s;ire after &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, we &s;hall never &s;eek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The&s;e De&s;ires after promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ings mu&s;t be made known to God in fervent Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>And this &s;eems to be in an e&s;pecial Manner intended when it is &s;aid, <HI>For this, I will be enquired of.</HI>&mdash;We read of <HI>&s;eeking</HI> God, and <HI>enquiring</HI> early after him. <HI>P&s;a.</HI> 78. 34. Doth God then &s;ay to us &s;eek ye my Face? Our Hearts &s;hould an&s;wer, thy Face Lord, we will &s;eek. Doth God in the&s;e Promi&s;es declare that he is ready to communicate the be&s;t of Ble&s;&s;ings to his People? We mu&s;t then put them in Suit, and plead them with him. Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near. God is plea&s;ed to manife&s;t him&s;elf to us in his Word and by his Providence, as the God who heareth Prayer; and he doth great Things for his People in An&s;wer to their Prayers. Accordingly our Lord &s;ays to us, Luke 11. 9. <HI>A&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find: knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you.</HI> We mu&s;t then by Prayer make our Reque&s;ts known to God in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thus enquire of the Lord, concerning the Fulfilment of his Promi&s;es: The&s;e are not given to &s;uper&s;ede, but to encourage our Prayers. Ver. 36. Context. <HI>I the Lord will do it.</HI> I will yet for this be enquired of.&mdash;Prayer is one of the Means
<PB N="11" REF="005055_0009_101692690128DC18">
of Grace which God would have his People u&s;e continu|ally in their Clo&s;ets, in their Families, and in the Places of their publick Wor&s;hip; that he may ble&s;s them as their Covenant-God with all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings. And in our Attendance on this great Duty, we mu&s;t approve our &s;elves the true <HI>Seed</HI> of <HI>Jacob</HI> who wre&s;t|led with the <HI>Angel</HI> of the Covenant, the <HI>Son of God</HI> in humble Importunity, refu&s;ing to let him go until he had ble&s;&s;ed him. Then we &s;hall find that good Word ful|fil'd to us. I&s;ai. 45. 19. <HI>I &s;aid not unto the Seed of Ja|cob, Seek ye me in vain.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Enquiring of the Lord may intend <HI>that we con&s;ult the Word of God as to the Way and Manner of our &s;eeking the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The Scriptures are call'd <HI>the Oracles of God.</HI> Rom. 3. 2. They are of infallible Truth, and given for our In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that we may be furni&s;hed unto all good Works. And therefore we mu&s;t con&s;ult the&s;e lively Oracles, if we would enquire of God in a right Manner concerning the Be&s;towment of promi&s;ed <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings.</HI> We mu&s;t &s;earch the Scriptures that we may know the&s;e Promi&s;es, and how we may obtain a Title to them. This is needful that we may &s;eek the Lord &s;o as to find him, and Life in the Light of his Countenance. John 5. 14. <HI>And this is the Confidence that we have in him, that if we a&s;k any Thing according to his Will, he hear|eth us.</HI> The Will of God then revealed in his Word mu&s;t be our Rule and Directory, while we thus enquire of the Lord. Thus, are we &s;eeking temporal good Things? we mu&s;t ob&s;erve God's Word as to the Manner of atten|ding this Duty, and not &s;eek them ab&s;olutely as the be&s;t Things; but only &s;o far as may be for the Glory of God, and con&s;i&s;tent with our eternal Welfare. But then, when we are &s;eeking &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, as at this Day; We mu&s;t &s;eek the&s;e with our whole Hearts as of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity in Order to our glorifying God in this Life, and preparing to enjoy him in Heaven. Matth. 6. 33.
<PB N="12" REF="005055_0010_1016926BA65527F8">
<HI>Seek ye fir&s;t the Kingdom of God, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all other Things &s;hall be added unto you.</HI> Here our <HI>All</HI> lies at Stake, and we mu&s;t accordingly &s;eek the more ear|ne&s;tly. While the many and mighty of this World en|quire, <HI>Who will &s;hew us good?</HI> Our great Petition mu&s;t be, <HI>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us.</HI> Now we mu&s;t lie down at the Foot of &s;overeign Grace, and &s;ay, with the deepe&s;t Humility; Lord, I can't bear a Denial. For we ought not to be willing to peri&s;h in that Place of Torments where the damned cur&s;e God, and die forever. Nor &s;hall we ever be thus mi&s;e|rable, if we &s;eek the Grace of God in Chri&s;t, and the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, in the fir&s;t and chief Place, with longing De&s;ires that can't be &s;atisfied without them.</P>
<P N="5">5. It intends that <HI>we wait upon God in the U&s;e of tho&s;e Means which he hath appointed for our obtaining the &s;piri|tual Ble&s;&s;ings contain'd in the Promi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;eek this or the other Good, without looking up to God for it, is <HI>profane.</HI> And for Men to &s;it &s;till, and &s;ay, Lord help! without u&s;ing the Means God hath ordain'd; this is <HI>pre&s;umptuous,</HI> and to tempt the Lord. While we therefore pray to God to heal our &s;piritual Maladies, and fill us with his Grace; we mu&s;t al&s;o be found in the di|ligent U&s;e of all other Means. We mu&s;t attend to read|ing, and take Heed how we hear the Word of God. We mu&s;t meditate on divine Things; con&s;ider their Reality, Importance and Excellency, that we may be quickned to the more earne&s;t Pur&s;uit of them. In a Word, We mu&s;t wait upon God in all Ways of Duty, that we may receive his Spirit, and &s;o his Ble&s;&s;ing. We mu&s;t &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate, and then to walk in that narrow Way which leads to everla&s;ting Life.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>How and after what Manner &s;hould God's People enquire of him to be&s;tow promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ings upon them?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1 <HI>In the Exerci&s;e of Faith on God, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Heb. 11. 6. <HI>Without Faith it is impo&s;&s;ible</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="005055_0011_1016926D4978AEC0">
<HI>to plea&s;e him: For he that cometh to God, mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him.</HI> We mu&s;t by Faith which is the Evidence of Things not &s;een, behold that God who is invi&s;ible, and reali&s;e his divine Perfections as manife&s;ted in his Word; his Knowledge, Wi&s;dom, Power, Goodne&s;s, Mercy, Truth, Holine&s;s, &amp;c. And then we mu&s;t remember there is <HI>one Mediator</HI> between God and Men, the <HI>Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> through whom we have Acce&s;s unto the Fa|ther. Accordingly we mu&s;t believe in God and believe al&s;o in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that through him our Faith and Hope may be in God. Out of Chri&s;t God is a con&s;uming Fire to the apo&s;tate Children of fallen <HI>Adam;</HI> in him God is the Father of Mercies, and ble&s;&s;eth his People with all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings. We mu&s;t therefore look to Je&s;us as the Propitiation for our Sins, and our Advocate with the Fa|ther, in our Approaches to God. Our Dependance mu&s;t be on the Merits and Mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when we a&s;k of God the Ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed in his Word. We mu&s;t make Mention of his worthy Name before the Lord, and rely upon it as the only Name, in which we can prevail. John 14.13, 14. <HI>And what&s;oever ye &s;hall a&s;k in my Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye &s;hall a&s;k any Thing in my Name, I will do it.</HI> All the Promi&s;es of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, they are all confirmed as true and certain; and we mu&s;t accordingly place our Tru&s;t and Confidence in him. As our Lord Je&s;us was obedient unto Death that he might purcha&s;e all &s;aving Ble&s;&s;ings for his People; &s;o he ever lives in Heaven to make Interce&s;&s;ion, and offer the Prayers of the Saints with much Incen&s;e, <HI>Rev.</HI> 8. 3, 4. And the Prayers of his People being thus recommended, re|ceive an An&s;wer of Peace.</P>
<P N="2">2. We mu&s;t attend this Duty <HI>with an aba&s;ing Sen&s;e of our own great Unworthine&s;s, and penitent Confe&s;&s;ion of our Sins.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="005055_0012_1016926FE9EA87A0">In this Re&s;pect we &s;hould imitate the Father of the Faithful in his pleading for <HI>Sodom.</HI> Gen. 18. 27. <HI>And Abraham an&s;wered and &s;aid, Behold now, I have taken upon me to &s;peak unto the Lord, which am but Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</HI> He acknowledgeth before the mo&s;t high God that he was formed out of the Du&s;t, and had de&s;erved to be con&s;umed in the Fire of God's Wrath for his own Ini|quities. And thus mu&s;t we lie down in the Du&s;t before the Lord, when we come to a&s;k the be&s;t of Ble&s;&s;ings; and confe&s;s with <HI>Jacob,</HI> that we are not worthy of the lea&s;t of all God's Mercies. We mu&s;t abhor the Self-Conceit of the proud <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> who had the vain Confi|dence to plead his religious Performances, as if he had made God a Debtor to him by them: And rather with the aba&s;ed <HI>Publican,</HI> &s;ay, <HI>Lord, be merciful to me a Sinner:</HI> For every one that <HI>exalteth</HI> him&s;elf, &s;hall be <HI>aba&s;ed;</HI> and he that <HI>humbleth</HI> him&s;elf, &s;hall be <HI>exalted.</HI> Luke 18. 14. God re&s;i&s;teth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the hum|ble. We mu&s;t then humble our&s;elves before God under a deep Sen&s;e of our &s;piritual Poverty, and be willing to re|ceive the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, as the Gifts of free Grace; if we would receive them at all, from that God who hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy. In this Sen&s;e we may expect that Word &s;hall be fulfilled, Luke 1. 53. <HI>He hath filled the Hungry with good Things, and the Rich he hath &s;ent empty away.</HI> And then, there mu&s;t be a <HI>penitent Confe&s;|&s;ion</HI> of Sin whereby we have forfeited our Lives, and all our Enjoyments into God's Hand. Now we mu&s;t &s;ay with <HI>Daniel</HI> when he &s;at his Face to &s;eek the Lord by Prayer. 9. Chapter 5. Ver&s;e. <HI>We have &s;inned and com|mitted Iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy Precepts, and from thy Judg|ments.</HI> 7. V. <HI>O Lord, Righteou&s;ne&s;s belongeth unto thee, but unto us Confu&s;ion of Faces, as at this Day.</HI> We mu&s;t mourn with the godly Sorrow which worketh Repentance, upon the Account of our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, whereby we have grieved the good Spirit of God, and provoked him to
<PB N="15" REF="005055_0013_1016927173672248">
depart from us. We mu&s;t with our Prayers offer to God this Day the Sacrifice of a broken Spirit; for <HI>a broken and contrite Heart, God will not de&s;pi&s;e.</HI> Thus &s;hall we be prepared to receive the &s;trong Con&s;olations contained in the Promi&s;es. Matth. 5. 4. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that mourn: for they &s;hall be comforted.</HI> In this Manner did God's ancient People &s;eek the Lord, and the Pro|phecy may look forward even to Go&s;pel Times. Jer. 50. 4, 5. <HI>In tho&s;e Days, and in that Time, &s;aith the Lord, the Children of I&s;rael &s;hall come, they and the Children of Ju|dah together, going and weeping: they &s;hall go, and &s;eek the Lord their God. They &s;hall a&s;k the Way to Zion with their Faces thitherward, &s;aying, Come, and let us join our &s;elves to the Lord, in a perpetual Covenant that &s;hall not be for|gotten.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. We mu&s;t attend this Duty <HI>with holy Importunity, and per&s;evering Diligence.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t heartily and earne&s;tly engage in this Duty, &s;en&s;ible of the great Excellency and Importance of &s;piri|tual Ble&s;&s;ings. Jam. 5. 16. <HI>The effectual fervent Prayer of a righteous Man availeth much.</HI> Thus <HI>Elias</HI> a Man &s;ubject to like Pa&s;&s;ions as we are, <HI>prayed earne&s;tly,</HI> and God an&s;wered him both by with-holding and giving Rain. May we &s;eek the Lord with like Fervency, <HI>'till he come, and rain Righteou&s;ne&s;s upon us!</HI> Our Saviour &s;pake a <HI>Parable</HI> to this end, <HI>that Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</HI> Luke 18. 1. And we have a mo&s;t encour|aging Example to this Purpo&s;e in the Woman of <HI>Canaan.</HI> Matth. 15. 22&mdash;28. She cried to our Saviour with Regard to her Daughter vexed with a Devil, <HI>Have Mer|cy, on me, O Lord!</HI> Our Lord appeared to be deaf to her Cries, He <HI>an&s;wered not a Word.</HI> Then his Di&s;ciples be&s;ought him to &s;end her away. And our Lord &s;aid, <HI>I am not &s;ent but unto the lo&s;t Sheep of the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he came and wor&s;hipped him, &s;aying, <HI>Lord, help me.</HI> Our Lord &s;eems then not only to give her another Repul&s;e, but to deny her Reque&s;t with
<PB N="16" REF="005055_0014_1016927544ABBD60">
Di&s;dain: <HI>It is not meet to take the Children's Bread, and ca&s;t it to Dogs.</HI> Carnal Rea&s;on would have concluded that this poor Woman had enough now to have over|whelmed her with De&s;pair of ever finding Relief; but behold! her per&s;evering Importunity ri&s;eth and groweth &s;tronger under the&s;e Pre&s;&s;ures, and &s;he makes a Plea of this An&s;wer in which our Lord &s;eemed to re|proach her as a Dog; <HI>Truth Lord: yet, the Dogs eat of the Crumbs</HI> which fall from their Ma&s;ter's Table. And then our Saviour's An&s;wer is mo&s;t gracious, and full of ten|der Mercy. V. 28. <HI>Then Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid unto her, O Woman, great is thy Faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her Daughter was made whole from that very Hour.</HI> And now where&s;oever the Go&s;pel is preached, the humble, and yet brave and bold Importunity of this Woman is told for a Memorial of her, and for our En|couragement in Prayer. Let us as true <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> go, and do likewi&s;e; and we &s;hall have Power with God, and prevail. Let us pray always with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit, watching thereunto with all Per&s;everance.</P>
<P N="4">4. We mu&s;t attend this Duty <HI>with thankful Acknowledg|ment of Ble&s;&s;ings received.</HI></P>
<P>When God is plea&s;ed to draw nigh to us in a Way of Grace and Favour, and to give &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings with a liberal Hand; we mu&s;t ble&s;s his glorious Name which is exalted above all Ble&s;&s;ing and Prai&s;e. P&s;alm 13. 6. <HI>I will &s;ing unto the Lord, becau&s;e he hath dealt bountifully with me.</HI> In an e&s;pecial Manner &s;hould we prai&s;e the Lord for that un&s;peakable Gift of his only begotten Son, and for the great and comprehen&s;ive Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, by whom Application is made of the Redemption purcha|&s;ed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We &s;hould ble&s;s God for the won|derful Effu&s;ions of his Spirit in the fir&s;t Times of Chri&s;ti|anity, whereby miraculous Gifts needful for the fir&s;t Propagation of the Go&s;pel, and abundant Grace were com|municated: And we ought al&s;o to prai&s;e the Lord that
<PB N="17" REF="005055_0015_1016927835599BA8">
He has not left us without a Witne&s;s of his divine Power and Grace in the wonderful Operations of his Spirit in our Times. We are bound in Duty and Gra|titude to obey that Word. Philip. 4. 6. <HI>Be careful for nothing; but in every Thing by Prayer and Supplication with Thank&s;giving, let your Reque&s;ts be made known unto God.</HI> While God's People enquire of him concerning the Be&s;towment of promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ings, they mu&s;t not forget to give Thanks.</P>
<P>Let the redeemed of the Lord then devoutly &s;ay, <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ed be the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath ble&s;&s;ed us with all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly Places in Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. We proceed <HI>to &s;hew the Obligations which lie upon God's People thus to enquire of the Lord for the Be&s;tow|ment of &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In this Way God's People mu&s;t glorify him as the Author of all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings.</HI></P>
<P>God appears in his Glory when he giveth &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings to his People. In the Works of his Spirit on the Hearts of Men his glorious Power, Wi&s;dom, Good|ne&s;s. Truth, Holine&s;s, Grace and Mercy are di&s;played. We mu&s;t pray then that God would in this Way &s;hew us his Glory, and proclaim his Name before us. And thus mu&s;t we give him Glory as the <HI>Father of Lights from whom cometh down every good Gift, and every perfect Gift;</HI> and adore him as the God of Salvation. When we thus enquire of the Lord we acknowledge that who|ever are the In&s;truments, the Excellency of the Power whereby Sinners are converted, mu&s;t be of God. Thus we give Glory to the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us, as to the Father of Mercies; to the Son of God as exalted to be a Prince and Saviour, and as having receiv|ed Gifts for Men; to the Holy Spirit as the Sanctifier and Comforter of his People.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="18" REF="005055_0016_1016927AEF2371A0">2. We mu&s;t attend this Duty <HI>in Obedience to the Will of God</HI> declared in his Word</P>
<P>Our Lord &s;ays to his People, <HI>I will for this be enquired of by the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI> God commands his People to pray alway, with all Prayer. And in his Word declareth that we mu&s;t wait on him in the Ways of his Appoint|ment, that we may receive &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, and that abundantly. I&s;ai. 55. 1&mdash;3. <HI>Ho, every one that thir&s;t|eth, come to the Waters, and he that hath no Money; come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy Wine and Milk without Money, and without Price. Wherefore do ye &s;pend your Money for that which is not Bread? and your Labour for that which &s;atisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your Soul delight it&s;elf in Fatne&s;s. Incline your Ear, and come unto me: bear, and your Soul &s;hall live, and I will make an everla&s;ting Covenant with you, even the &s;ure Mercies of David.</HI> And the Commandment is given with a gracious Promi&s;e annexed to it. Matth. 7. 7. <HI>A&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you: &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find: knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is our Duty <HI>in this Way to declare our high E&s;teem for the Ble&s;&s;ings contained in the Promi&s;es, and to expre&s;s our longing De&s;ires after them.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t thus acknowledge that the Promi&s;es are ex|ceeding great and precious, and reach after the Accom|pli&s;hment of them. Prov. 4. 7. <HI>Wi&s;dom is the principal Thing, therefore get Wi&s;dom: and with all thy getting get Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>We &s;tand in ab&s;olute Need of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings that we may glorify God upon Earth, and prepare to enjoy him forever in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Now this is the chief End of Man, the great Errand upon which God hath &s;ent us into the World. And un|le&s;s we mind this one Thing needful, we live in vain, and &s;hall die without Wi&s;dom; yea mu&s;t peri&s;h in Hell forever. Alas! We are <HI>all fallen &s;hort of the Glory of</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="005055_0017_1016665A138FB0C0">
<HI>God</HI> as Children of apo&s;tate <HI>Adam,</HI> and unle&s;s it plea&s;e God by his Holy Spirit <HI>to form us to &s;hew forth his Prai&s;e,</HI> we &s;hall become Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath fitted to De&s;truction. Unle&s;s the Means of Grace are accompanied with the divine Spirit and Ble&s;&s;ing, they will be the Savour of Death unto Death. We &s;hall be like that Ground which bear|eth Thorns and Briers; and &s;o is nigh to cur&s;ing, who&s;e End is to be burned. But if we receive this Ble&s;&s;ing from God, we &s;hall bear that Fruit whereby our <HI>heavenly Fa|ther is glorified.</HI></P>
<P>And thus &s;hall we enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings of the King|dom of Grace in this World, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t; and be prepared for the Kingdom of Glory.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Let us now apply the&s;e Things to the Work and Duties of this Day.</HI></P>
<P>We are a&s;&s;embled to a&s;k of God the plentiful Effu&s;i|ons of his Spirit upon his People, more particularly of the Flock who u&s;ually wor&s;hip God in this Place; and to ble&s;s his Name for &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings already received in the remarkable Revival of his Work among us, and in many other Towns. We are al&s;o met together to in|treat the Lord that he would pre&s;erve us and his People from every Thing that hath a Tendency to quench his Spirit, and ob&s;truct the Progre&s;s and Succe&s;s of his good Work; that it may go on and pro&s;per, till the whole Land &s;hall be filled with the ble&s;&s;ed Fruits of the Spirit. An important Errand indeed! O that there was a Spi|rit in us to cry mightily to God for this great Ble&s;&s;ing; while we humble our &s;elves before the Lord for our pa&s;t Unfruitfulne&s;s, and all tho&s;e Sins whereby we have grie|ved the Spirit of God! We have formerly once and again ob&s;erved &s;uch Days of Prayer to &s;eek the Lord for &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, the comprehen&s;ive Sum of which is the
<PB N="20" REF="005055_0018_10169281C8272880">
<HI>Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And may we not hope that God is now giving a gracious An&s;wer to the Supplications which have in this Way been offered to him in Years pa&s;t? And ought not this to encourage us now to pray the more earne&s;tly? Yes &s;urely. <HI>We wait for thy Sal|vation, O Lord, who ha&s;t received Gifts for Men, even for the rebellious; and art plea&s;ed to &s;ay unto us, If ye, being evil know how to give good Gifts unto your Children; how much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give the Spirit to them that a&s;k him?</HI> Let us then with an high E&s;teem of the&s;e &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, lift up our Hearts with our Hands to God this Day that he would ble&s;s us indeed; Ble&s;s us with the more abundant Effu&s;ions of his Spirit, to convince us more and more of Sin, that Sinners prick|ed to the Heart may &s;ay, What &s;hall we do? to convert us, that many may be born from above, and &s;o enter in|to the Kingdom of God; to carry on his Work in his Children, that they may <HI>grow in Grace, and in the Know|ledge of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and to <HI>comfort</HI> the Mour|ners in <HI>Zion,</HI> that they may rejoice together in the Sal|vation of God. And let us then all unite in our diligent and prudent Endeavours to promote this Work, each one keeping within his own Line. Let the <HI>Mini&s;ters of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t give them&s;elves continually to Prayer, and to the Mini&s;try of the Word;</HI> that by you God may delight to give his People the Fulne&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Go&s;pel, which is <HI>the Mini&s;tration of the Spirit,</HI> 2 Cor. 3. 8. Let us in the Way of Duty wait upon God that we may be &s;trengthned with all Might, by the Spirit. For who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e Things? <HI>Brethren, pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may have free Cour&s;e, and be glorified.</HI> Let us &s;eek the promi&s;ed Pre&s;ence of our a&s;cended Saviour, and in the Way of Study and painful Labour depend on him for all that Ability and Skill we need to make us wi&s;e to win Souls, and lead them unto Chri&s;t. And let us unite our Endeavours in this great and difficult Work, as Fellow-Helpers to the
<PB N="21" REF="005055_0019_10169284B7309210">
Truth; that we may promote each other's U&s;efulne&s;s in the right Improvement of tho&s;e Gifts which our glo|rious Head has in various Kinds and Degrees communi|cated to us for the Edification of his Body, the Church. And let the Succe&s;s which God hath of late given to the Mini&s;try of the Word above what we have known in Times pa&s;t, animate us to labour more abundantly. Ble&s;&s;ed are they that &s;ow be&s;ide all Waters, when the Spirit is poured from on high. Certainly, it will be an abundant Recompence for all our Pains, if God's Peo|ple may be <HI>our Crown of Joy</HI> in the Day of the Lord. I mention the&s;e Things in Humility, as one &s;en&s;ible of my own great Defects in the Work of the Mini|&s;try.</P>
<P>Again, Let <HI>the&s;e Churches hear what the Spirit &s;aith to them</HI> in his Word, and by his Works of Grace. Walk together in the Faith and Order of the Go&s;pel. Obey that Word, of our Lord. Rev. 2. 5. <HI>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy fir&s;t Works.</HI> O that our religious A&s;&s;emblies might be as fruitful Fields which the Lord hath ble&s;&s;ed, in which the good Seed of the Word plentifully &s;own, &s;hall take Root, &s;pring up, and bear Fruit an hundred Fold! The Lord multiply the Seed &s;own, and increa&s;e the Fruits of your Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Again, Let our <HI>Honoured Rulers</HI> be intreated to give an helping Hand to this Work by your Example and Influence, and by your Authority. God hath put Ho|nour upon you; Do you then honour him by leading in the great and nece&s;&s;ary Work of a general Reformation. Be not a Terror to good Works, but to the evil. In vain &s;hall we boa&s;t of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Name,</HI> if the great Things of the <HI>Moral Law</HI> are counted as a &s;trange Thing among us. Let Judgment run down as Waters, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s as a mighty Stream. Furthermore,</P>
<P>Let <HI>Heads of Families</HI> be exhorted to encourage the Work of God by their Prayers, by their Example and
<PB N="22" REF="005055_0020_1016928763E14D80">
Authority in their Hou&s;es. That God who &s;ets the Solitary in Families, and builds the Hou&s;e; has com|mitted this important Tru&s;t to you with a &s;olemn Charge to bring up your Children and all under your Care, in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord. You mu&s;t therefore take up <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s Re&s;olution. 24th Chap. 15. <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord.</HI> When God promi&s;eth to pour out the Spirit of Grace and Sup|plication upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> and Inhabitants of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> it is &s;aid, that they &s;hould look to him whom they had pierced and mourn; yea, that the <HI>Land &s;hould mourn, every Family apart&mdash;</HI>Zech. 12. 10&mdash;13. And then follows the mo&s;t gracious Promi&s;e of God's open|ing a Fountain to the Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> and the Inha|bitants of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to wa&s;h away their Sins. Chap 13. Let Heads of Families then call upon the Name of the Lord in their Hou&s;es, that he may pour out his Spirit on them, and &s;o ble&s;s them in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in whom all the Families of the Earth are ble&s;&s;ed. Imitate King <HI>David,</HI> who after he had wor&s;hipped God with his Peo|ple, <HI>returned to ble&s;s his Hou&s;hold.</HI> 2 Sam. 6. 20. Let our Family-Prayer be in the Morning &s;et before God as Incen&s;e, and the offering up of our Hands as the Evening Sacrifice. Le&s;t that dreadful Cur&s;e fall upon us and our Hou&s;es. Jer. 10.25. <HI>Pour out thy Fury upon the Hea|then that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not on thy Name.</HI> And let us all walk before God in our Hou&s;es with a perfect Heart, and in a perfect Way, &s;aying with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>O when wilt thou come unto me?</HI> And then, call upon all under your Roofs to &s;eek and &s;erve the Lord. Travail in Birth again with your Children, till they are born of the Spirit, and &s;o have Chri&s;t formed in them. And u&s;e your be&s;t Endeavours that your Servants may become the Children of God, and Heirs according to the Promi&s;e, by Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Let your Children and Servants have Leave to attend the Means of Grace as there may be Opportu|nity,

and the Bu&s;ine&s;s of your Families will allow of it. And in an e&s;pecial Manner <HI>Remember the Sabbath Day,</HI> to keep it holy in your Dwellings; for the Lord has ble&s;&s;ed this Day, and hallowed it to be a Day of commu|nicating &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings to his People. O wait upon God with your Hou&s;es on the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> and labour for the Meat which endureth to everla&s;ting Life! And on <HI>others Days,</HI> abide with God in a diligent Attendance upon your particular Calling. Do your own Bu&s;ine&s;s, and let there be no ju&s;t Occa&s;ion for that Complaint. 2 The&s;&s;. 3. 11. <HI>We hear that there are &s;ome which walk among you di&s;orderly, working not at all, but are Bu&s;ie-bodies.</HI> The great Evil, of neglecting our own Affairs and med|ling with tho&s;e Things which do not belong to us, is both the Parent and Nur&s;e of many &s;hameful Vices that have a Tendency to di&s;honour God, and grieve his Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Let our Children and young People go to God for the great Ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed in the Go&s;pel.</HI> Thir&s;t after the&s;e living Waters, and plead that Promi&s;e with God.

Con&s;ider how dreadful it will be for you to be left behind to peri&s;h in your Sins, when others are taken. And look diligently lea&s;t any of you &s;hould fail of the Grace of God, <HI>Lea&s;t there be a profane Per|&s;on as E&s;au,</HI> who for one Mor&s;el of Meat <HI>&s;old his Birth|right;</HI>

<P>Or are there <HI>any grown old in Years, and yet &s;tanding as barren Trees in God's Vineyard?</HI> Have you &s;tood more than ten Times three Years under the Means of Grace, and yet remain dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins?

Matth. 3. 10. <HI>The Ax is laid unto the Root of the Trees: Therefore every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down, and ca&s;t into the Fire.</HI> Admire the Patience of God, and de&s;pi&s;e not the Riches of his Goodne&s;s, and Long-&s;uffering; not knowing that the Goodne&s;s of God leadeth thee to Repentance. O take Heed lea&s;t after your Hardne&s;s and impenitent Heart, you trea&s;ure up Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath! O be &s;en&s;ible of the deep Corruption of your Hearts which have re&s;i&s;ted all the Means God has for &s;o long Time u&s;ed with you, and cry to God for the inward and effectual Call of his Spirit; that you may be born again, even when you are old; and that in you Chri&s;t may &s;hew forth all Long-&s;uffering, for a Pattern to them which &s;hall here|after believe on him to Life everla&s;ting. O remember, it will be a mo&s;t dreadful Thing to go down to Hell after a long and clear Day of Go&s;pel Grace. To &s;uch <HI>is re|&s;erv'd the Blackne&s;s of Darkne&s;s forever.</HI> Do not then grieve and vex the Holy Spirit any longer, but attend to what he &s;ays in his Word, <HI>To Day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>Let &s;uch as are under the Convictions of the Spirit, &s;eek a &s;aving Conver&s;ion unto God.</HI> O beware of quenching the Spirit! Now &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate; pre&s;s into the Kingdom of God. Are you made &s;en&s;ible of the Plague of your own Hearts? Pray to God, to heal your Souls.

<P>Or <HI>have any obtained Joy in believing.</HI> Adore that God who has Mercy on whom he will have Mercy; and &s;ay, <HI>not unto us 0 Lord,</HI> not unto us; but to thy Name give Glory. Rejoice with holy Fear, and great Humility.</P>

<P>As for the <HI>Out-cries, Tremblings,</HI> and <HI>Faintings</HI> which have been experienced in &s;ome Places, I apprehend the Cau&s;e mu&s;t be judged of by the Effect. We may not limit the Holy One. The <HI>Jailor came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas.</HI>&mdash;They who heard <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Sermon</HI> were <HI>pricked in their Heart,</HI> and &s;aid to <HI>Peter,</HI> and to the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, Men and Brethren, what &s;hall we do? <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 37. A wounded Spirit who can bear? If &s;uch Per&s;ons therefore have an holy Awe of God, a deep Humiliation under the Sen&s;e of Sin, and ear|ne&s;t Concern about Deliverance from it; here is the Finger of God. And if it &s;hall plea&s;e God to impre&s;s &s;uch a Sen&s;e of Sin, and of his Wrath on Men, that they are forced to cry out under it; they are to be pitied, and proper Means u&s;ed for their Relief; and not to be cen|&s;ured as mad and out-ragious. But then, if any would indulge them&s;elves in the&s;e Out-cries, e&s;pecially in Time of publick Wor&s;hip, when there is no real Nece&s;&s;ity for it, and they might re&s;train them&s;elves; I think they

are di&s;orderly, and do that which has a Tendency to di&s;|turb the quiet attentive hearing of God's Word. Nor may we make a Judgment of a Work whether genuine or no, meerly by &s;uch extraordinary Commotions. For there have been Tremblings which have not proceeded from the Spirit of Truth and Holine&s;s. Let us not then pre&s;ume to confine the <HI>free Spirit</HI> of God, but regard the Sub&s;tance of the Work it&s;elf. I make no Doubt but that in our Congregations many have been deeply wounded for Sin without the&s;e Out-cries, and that the Convictions have in con&s;iderable Numbers i&s;&s;ued in a &s;aving Cover|&s;ion to God. Nor can I &s;uppo&s;e that it is the Duty of Mini&s;ters to try to excite the&s;e Schreamings; but rather to &s;et the Terrors of the Law and gracious Invitations of the Go&s;pel before Men in the mo&s;t powerful Manner they are able; and than leave it to the only wi&s;e God to take his own Way, who can if he plea&s;eth order the&s;e Things to the Awakning of others; as we are informed has been the Ca&s;e, in &s;ome other Places. Let not &s;uch then as have not felt this Degree of Terror, judge them that have; and let not &s;uch as have been thus wrought upon, judge them that have not: But let both prove their own Work, and examine by the Word of God whether the Fruits of the Spirit are found in them, &s;uch as Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; Love to God, and our Neighbour, Meekne&s;s, Humility, and the like. If upon an impartial Trial you find the&s;e Things in you, you will have rejoicing in your&s;elves, and not in another. And let not any who have been made &s;en&s;ible of their peri&s;hing Condition, and then enabled to &s;ubmit to Chri&s;t as their only Saviour, deny the Work of Grace God has wrought in them becau&s;e they have not felt &s;uch a Degree of Terror, and then &s;uch rapturous Joys as others may have experienced. But rather be encou|raged to wait upon God in the Way of Duty for the A&s;&s;|urance and Joy of Faith. And let not your Eye be evil, becau&s;e God is good. May not God do what he will
<PB N="27" REF="005055_0025_10169295DA8231A0">
with his own? Do not then behave as the <HI>elder Son</HI> in the <HI>Parable,</HI> who was angry upon the Account of the Joy expre&s;&s;ed in his Father's Hou&s;e, when his Prodigal Bro|ther returned a true Penitent. There is Joy in Heaven over the Sinner that repenteth; and there mu&s;t be ju&s;t Occa&s;ion for Joy upon Earth, when the Dead are thus made alive, and the lo&s;t are found.</P>
<P>Again, As to tho&s;e extraordinary Appearances in <HI>Trances,</HI> and the Things uttered by Per&s;ons that have fallen under them; No Stre&s;s may be laid on the&s;e Things to determine the pre&s;ent or future State of Men. <HI>Secret Things belong to God.</HI> His Word is given us for our Rule. To the Law, and to the Te&s;timony.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Let not new Converts imagine that they are called and qualified to be Teachers of God's Word. Are all Pro|phets? Are all Teachers?</HI> 1 Cor. 12. 29. No cer|tainly, our a&s;cended Saviour has appointed the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, and given to his Church <HI>Pa&s;tors and Teachers.</HI> Nor may any take upon them this Office, who are not called to it according to the Order appointed in God's Word. Let your Zeal then be expre&s;&s;ed according to Knowledge, and &s;ound Judgment. It is granted, you may out of the Abundance of your Hearts utter the Prai&s;es of the great God your Saviour, and with Humility declare what he hath done for your Souls, in proper Time and Place; and edify one another by Chri&s;tian Conference, and the like. But then, there's a great Difference be|tween this, and &s;etting up for Teachers. And I am per|&s;uaded that the natural Tendency of this, however God may over-rule it, is to introduce Di&s;order, and to bring the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try into Contempt: as if there needed no Study, Gifts and Learning to qualify Men for this dif|ficult and important Office. The Apo&s;tle's Rule is that. 1 Tim. 3. 6. <HI>Not a Novice, lea&s;t being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="005055_0026_101692976699BE90">Again, <HI>Let the more private Meetings of Chri&s;tians be en|couraged, &amp; well regulated.</HI> Exerci&s;e your &s;elves in &s;uch Du|ties as are proper for you, and let good Hours be ob&s;erved, that Family-Religion and Clo&s;et-Piety may have their due Proportion of Time. <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erveth, <HI>that to every Thing there is a Sea&s;on; and that God has made every Thing beautiful in his Time.</HI> Eccl. 3. 1 &mdash;11. Accor|dingly, that Duty is like to be performed in the be&s;t Man|ner, which is done &s;ea&s;onably. There's a Time for pub|lick Wor&s;hip, a Time for Family and Clo&s;et Devotion, and a Time for our needful Re&s;t in the Night, that being refre&s;hed with Sleep, we may be prepared for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day, when <HI>Man goeth forth to his Labour.</HI> And if for Want of a due Regard to the&s;e Sea&s;ons, our Families &s;hould &s;uffer in their Spiritual or Temporal Intere&s;ts, the God of Order will be di&s;plea&s;ed with us. I am not now &s;peaking of this or the other extraordinary Ca&s;e, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul continued his Speech until Midnight,</HI> being to depart on the Morrow: But of the or|dinary Practi&s;e of Chri&s;tians in their more private Meet|ings. In a Word, <HI>Let all Things be done decently, and in Order.</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>Avoid all ra&s;h judging and cen&s;uring one another,</HI> as Hypocrites and unconverted. For our Lord hath &s;aid, <HI>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</HI> Matth. 7. 1. Indeed the Tree is to be known by its Fruits. And we ought to exerci&s;e &s;uch a Judgment of Di&s;cretion and Charity towards our Neighbour, as to watch over him, and keep our &s;elves pure. But then to pronounce concerning Per|&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing Godline&s;s, without Here&s;y or moral Scan|dal openly incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch a Profe&s;&s;ion, that they are Hypocrites and Phari&s;ees; this is a bold Inva&s;ion of God's Prerogative, who &s;earcheth the Heart; and &s;ays to us, <HI>Judge nothing before the Time.</HI> And for any to utter &s;uch Cen&s;ures is a great Injury, and Breach of Chri&s;tian Charity. And this Sin is aggravated, when &s;uch Cen&s;ures are pa&s;&s;ed on Men of publick Character,
<PB N="29" REF="005055_0027_101692994DC3D1A8">
particularly on the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel; for hereby not only is their per&s;onal Character wounded; but al&s;o, their publick U&s;efulne&s;s may be ob&s;tructed. Let us then avoid this Evil. Rom. 14. 10. <HI>Why do&s;t thou judge thy Brother? or why do&s;t thou &s;et at nought thy Brother? for we &s;hall all &s;tand before the Judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t.</HI> This is not the Way to reclaim Men; but rather to exa&s;perate them, and &s;tir up that Contention which leads to Confu&s;ion, and every evil Work.</P>
<P>In a Word, Let us be zealous for God, and good Wories; and at the &s;ame Time beware of the dangerous Extreaty of Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>And thus I have taken Liberty to touch upon &s;everal Things which I apprehend worthy of our &s;erious Con&s;i|deration under the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, if we would avoid giving the great Adver&s;ary Advantage to blemi&s;h God's Work; and if we would &s;top the Mouths of Gain&s;ayers. May we re&s;i&s;t the Devil, not being igno|rant of his Devices! May we, in this critical Conjunc|ture, walk circum&s;pectly, not as Fools, but as Wi&s;e! It is my Judgment that the prudent Regulation of our <HI>religious <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> is of great Moment in order to our defending and pre&s;erving the <HI>Work of God,</HI> as we are unworthy In&s;truments in his Hand. And this is what I have &s;incerely de&s;ign'd and endeavour'd in the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e, &amp; not to reproach any Per&s;on what&s;o|ever, or to di&s;courage any good Work. Let not any then pervert what hath been &s;aid to prejudice them&s;elves or others again&s;t that <HI>wonderful Work of Grace,</HI> which I verily believe, God has wrought in this Town, and other Places. It is no &s;trange Thing if <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Men are charge|able with Imprudences and Irregularities. But as for God, <HI>His Work is perfect.</HI> Let us then hear our Lord and Judge, <HI>Wo unto the World becau&s;e of Offences,</HI> and be|ware lea&s;t we be offended in Chri&s;t. And let not God's People be alienated from each other becau&s;e of &s;ome Dif|ference in Judgment. Be valiant for the Truth; and at the &s;ame Time, follow the Things which make for
<PB N="30" REF="005055_0028_1016929D7401DBA8">
Peace, and Things wherewith one may edify another. Let tho&s;e Words &s;ink deep into your Hearts. Eph. 4. 29&mdash;32. <HI>Let no corrupt Communication proceed out of your Mouth, but that which is good to the U&s;e of edifying, that it may mini&s;ter Grace unto the Hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are &s;ealed unto the Day of Redemption. Let all Bitterne&s;s, and Wrath, and Anger and Glamour, and evil-&s;peaking be put away from you, with all Malice. And be kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chri&s;t's &s;ake hath forgiven you.</HI> And let us all unite in &s;eeking the Ad|vancement of Chri&s;t's Kingdom among us. Let us pray that Mini&s;ters and People may have all needed Wi&s;|dom and Grace to know and attend their Duty in this Day of Vi&s;itation. Let us pray as P&s;al. 90. 16, 17. <HI>Let thy Work appear unto thy Servants, and thy Glory unto their Children. And let the Beauty of the Lord our God be upon us: and e&s;tabli&s;h thou the Work of our Hands upon us, yea, the Work of our Hands e&s;tabli&s;h thou it.</HI> May we be more and more enriched with the Showers of Ble&s;&s;ing from the third Heaven! May the&s;e <HI>holy Waters</HI> increa&s;e and &s;pread far and wide, like the Waters in <HI>Eze|kiah</HI>'s <HI>Vi&s;ion!</HI> May they be for the quickning, clean&s;ing, and healing of Sinners; and for the refre&s;hing of God's Children, and the cau&s;ing them to abound in the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s! Thus we &s;hall be prepared for the be&s;t Pro&s;perity. Thus &s;hall we obtain Fruits more precious than tho&s;e which are put forth by Virtue of the Light and Rain of Heaven. God, even our own God, will ble&s;s us, and we &s;hall obtain Salvation from the Light of his Countenance. Ezek. 39.29. <HI>Neither will I hide my Face any more from them: for I have poured out my Spirit upon the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, &s;aith the Lord God.</HI></P>
