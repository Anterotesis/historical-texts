<L>LET martial &s;ouls, whom wild ambition warms,</L>
<L>The trumpet's clangor, and rude din of arms,</L>
<L>Point out the path victorious heroes trod,</L>
<L>The pe&s;t of nations, and the &s;courge of God:</L>
<L>Mine be the task, in humbler ver&s;e to trace</L>
<L>The <HI>real</HI> greatne&s;s of the human race.</L>

<L>Tho' rude and &s;avage Afric's &s;ons we find,</L>
<L>Yet there fir&s;t Science dawn'd upon mankind,</L>
<L>There curb'd the pa&s;&s;ions in perpetual &s;trife,</L>
<L>And there begat the &s;ofter arts of life.</L>

<L>And watch'd the motions of the rolling Spheres.</L>
<L>Their mode&s;t wants plain Nature could redre&s;s,</L>
<L>And Science gave them rural happine&s;s.</L>
<L>Egypt beheld her twilight's fainter ray,</L>
<L>And form'd fond hopes of her meridian day;</L>
<L>When, lo! tyrannic rage u&s;urp'd the whole,</L>
<L>And cramp'd with fetters each high &s;welling &s;oul.</L>
<L>Di&s;order'd fancy &s;uper&s;tition bred;</L>
<L>She clap'd her wings, and thought her foe was dead;</L>
<L>Yet &s;he but fled, to gain in happy Greece,</L>
<L>What Egypt had deny'd her, rural peace.</L>
<L>The Grecian &s;ouls, form'd of the &s;ubtle&s;t kind,</L>
<L>In Freedom nurtur'd, &s;trength'ned and refin'd,</L>
<L>Quick catch'd the flame; it ran from &s;oul to &s;oul,</L>
<L>And like electric fire, in&s;pir'd the whole.</L>
<L>Here Poets &s;ang, and Rhetoricians plead,</L>
<L>Here State&s;men &s;at, and patriot Worthies bled.</L>
<L>Ah blindne&s;s to the future! headlong to&s;s'd,</L>
<L>They gra&s;p'd the &s;hadow, but the &s;ub&s;tance lo&s;t.</L>
<L>Greece led her armies Troy's high walls to ra&s;e;</L>
<L>The city &s;hook and totter'd to its ba&s;e,</L>
<L>At length it fell&mdash;but from its ruins ro&s;e</L>
<L>A vagrant band to &s;ubjugate their foes.</L>

<L>Towns, cities, kingdoms into ruin hurl'd,</L>
<L>And reign'd &s;upreme alone. Greece felt her force,</L>
<L>Nor &s;tem'd the torrent in its rapid cour&s;e;</L>
<L>All victims fell to its re&s;i&s;tle&s;s rage,</L>
<L>The rough Barbarian, and the Grecian Sage.</L>
<L>Ardent the Romans Grecian &s;cience view'd,</L>
<L>Nor &s;corn'd to learn of tho&s;e they had &s;ubdu'd;</L>
<L>They reach'd the &s;ame &s;ublimity of thought,</L>
<L>And tho&s;e, who learned, equal'd tho&s;e, who taught.</L>
<L>There godlike Homer rear'd his awful head,</L>
<L>Here Virgil &s;ang, and here great Tully plead.</L>
<L>As when &s;ome mighty torrent, &s;wol'n with rain,</L>
<L>Falls ru&s;hing, da&s;hing, 'till it meets the plain,</L>
<L>O'er craggy rocks bends its re&s;i&s;tle&s;s force,</L>
<L>From clift to clift loud thund'ring in its cour&s;e;</L>
<L>So did the Athenian patriotic rave,</L>
<L>And taught his country to be nobly brave.</L>
<L>Not &s;o the Roman. As the ancient Nile</L>
<L>Glides &s;moothly on within its banks a while,</L>
<L>Slow, gradual, ri&s;ing, then o'er&s;peads the plain,</L>
<L>And adds all Egypt to the &s;welling main;</L>
