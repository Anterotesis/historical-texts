<P>THE occa&s;ion, my chri&s;tian friends, which calls us together this day to the hou&s;e of God, is equally important and joyous; and the ob&s;ervance of this day by the whole people of united America, in public expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude to God for important national ble&s;&s;ings, exhibits to the imagination a mo&s;t magnificent and intere&s;ting &s;cene.</P>
<P>To aid us in contemplations &s;uited to the occa&s;ion, I have &s;elected the pa&s;&s;age of Scripture which has now been read.</P>
<P>It may be applied, perhaps, with as &s;triking pro|priety to the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the inhabitants of this country, as it ever could be to tho&s;e of any people, &s;ince its original application, by the &s;acred penman, to the &s;ituation of the children of I&s;rael, at a time of great pro&s;perity.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="029830_0004_0FE2776BE9184F38">
In the Pre&s;ident's proclamation for this day, we have a repre&s;entation of the pre&s;ent condition of the United States, which remarkably corre&s;ponds, in its leading features, with the elegant and &s;ublime de&s;|cription in the text.</P>
<P><HI>He maketh peace,</HI> &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>in thy borders.</HI> The Pre&s;ident, in the preamble to the proclamation, &s;peaks of <Q>our exemption hitherto from foreign war, and an increa&s;ing pro&s;pect of the continuance of that exemption.</Q> The P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>He hath &s;trengthened the bars of thy gates.</HI> The Pre&s;ident takes notice of <Q>the great degree of internal tranquility we have enjoyed, and the recent confirmation of that tranquility, by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of an in&s;urrec|tion which &s;o wantonly threatened it.</Q> And parallel to the words of the text, <HI>He hath ble&s;&s;ed thy children within thee, and filleth thee with the fine&s;t of the wheat,</HI> are tho&s;e of the proclamation, which remind us of <Q>the happy cour&s;e of our public affairs in general, and the unexampled pro&s;perity of all cla&s;&s;es of our citizens.</Q></P>
<P>On account of &s;uch important public ble&s;&s;ings, the children of I&s;rael are called upon to expre&s;s their gratitude to God. <HI>Prai&s;e the Lord, O Jeru&s;alem, prai&s;e thy God, O Zion!</HI> And in <Q>circum&s;tances which &s;o peculiarly mark <HI>our</HI> &s;ituation with indications of the divine beneficence towards us,</Q> we are reminded in the proclamation of our <Q>duty as a people, with
<PB N="7" REF="029830_0005_0FE2776D734A91C8">devout reverence, and affectionate gratitude, to acknowlege our many and great obligations to Almighty God, and to implore him to continue and confirm the ble&s;&s;ings we experience.</Q></P>
<P>That we may know the extent of our obligations, and have feelings awakened an&s;werable to them; let us now take a particular view of that &s;tate of pro&s;|perity, which, at this day, marks the condition of the United States; the general outlines of which are &s;o ju&s;tly &s;ketched in the proclamation.</P>
<P>The ba&s;is of all our public happine&s;s are certainly the <HI>con&s;titutions of government</HI> under which we live; which, in a degree perhaps never before experienced in any country, "unite, and by their union e&s;tabli&s;h, liberty with order."</P>
<P>In other countries, <HI>liberty</HI> has u&s;ually langui&s;hed under a &s;y&s;tem of corruption, or been cru&s;hed beneath the arm of arbitrary power; or el&s;e the <HI>&s;ocial order</HI> has become the victim of faction; and <HI>liberty</HI> has degenerated into a licentiou&s;ne&s;s, more dreadful in its operation, and more oppre&s;&s;ive in its effects than any other &s;y&s;tem of tyranny.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of the United States, and tho&s;e of the &s;everal &s;tates which compo&s;e the Union, are formed on purely republican principles. They were the deliberate act of the people,&mdash;intended to &s;ecure their rights, by guarding, on the one hand, again&s;t encroachment and oppre&s;&s;ion by per&s;ons inve&s;ted
<PB N="8" REF="029830_0006_0FE2777B31E48D70">with civil power; and, on the other, again&s;t the numberle&s;s evils, which mu&s;t re&s;ult from a relap&s;e into licentiou&s;ne&s;s and di&s;order. And they happily embrace the two great objects of government,&mdash;&s;e|curity of rights to individuals, and of &s;trength, dig|nity, and order to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e con&s;titutions every man enjoys perfect &s;ecurity, and feels an hone&s;t independence, while he conducts con&s;i&s;tently with the general good, and does not contravene the rights of others. The poore&s;t member of the community is con&s;cious of a perfect equality with the riche&s;t, in re&s;pect to the protection of his per&s;on, and the &s;ecurity of his property. And not only &s;o, but, under the con&s;titution of this Com|monwealth with few exceptions, and under that of the United States without any, he is taught to feel his importance as a member of the body politic, by his having an equal voice in the election of per&s;ons to hold the mo&s;t important offices of government, and by being him&s;elf, equally with others, eligible to the fir&s;t offices.</P>
<P>It is a great excellency of our government, that our rulers are from among our&s;elves; and that they do not derive their &s;tations from birth, or any adven|titious circum&s;tances, but are rai&s;ed to office by the &s;uffrages of the people; that they enjoy no heredi|tary di&s;tinction, or right of domination; that they are &s;ervants of the people,&mdash;accountable to them for
<PB N="9" REF="029830_0007_0FE2777CD63447C8">their conduct in the offices in which they are placed by their voice, and liable to be di&s;placed, if they are found to neglect their duty, or betray their tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Our con&s;titutions of government, under which all enjoy equal rights, by having equal protection of per&s;ons and &s;ecurity of property, and by being equal|ly repre&s;ented in the admini&s;tration, are the glory of our land, and the admiration and envy of the friends of freedom in other countries. Imperfections they doubtle&s;s have in common with all other productions of human wi&s;dom; yet &s;uch is, notwith&s;tanding, their intrin&s;ic excellence and real importance, that the contemplation of them this day may with the greate&s;t propriety fill with &s;atisfaction <HI>our</HI> hearts, who are &s;o deeply intere&s;ted in them, and our lips with prai&s;e to the benign Author of all good: ina&s;much as they lay the foundation of all our civil and politi|cal advantages, and are the &s;ource of mo&s;t of our &s;o|cial and dome&s;tic felicity.</P>
<P>Next to the glorious fabric of our government, "the pre&s;ervation of our peace foreign and dome&s;tic," by which we continue to enjoy its ble&s;&s;ings, lays claim to a tribute of gratitude to the <HI>God of peace.</HI></P>
<P>In order ju&s;tly to e&s;timate the ble&s;&s;ing of peace foreign and dome&s;tic at the pre&s;ent day, and in the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs, it is nece&s;&s;ary for us to lend our attention to the circum&s;tances which have, for &s;ome time, endangered its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="029830_0008_0FE2777E64739E88">
Several circum&s;tances, in the cour&s;e of two years pa&s;t, have concurred to embarra&s;s our internal affairs, and to render our &s;ituation with foreign nations ex|tremely delicate and critical.</P>
<P>The war, which has been carried on with &s;o much zeal and ob&s;tinacy between France and &s;everal of the European powers combined again&s;t her liberties and independence, could not, from the nature of the thing, be unintere&s;ting to this country. Having our|&s;elves, &s;o lately, made a glorious and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ac|rifice in the cau&s;e of liberty, it was natural for us to rejoice to &s;ee the principles of freedom extending their influence. And we could not but behold with peculiar &s;atisfaction the ardent and re&s;olute exertions for freedom in a large and powerful nation with which we were in alliance; and which had long groan|ed under as refined and &s;y&s;tematic de&s;poti&s;m, as, per|haps, ever exi&s;ted in the world.&mdash;And, proportioned to our &s;atisfaction in the efforts made by the French nation to &s;hake off the fetters of &s;lavery, and recover their freedom, was our indignation at the unprovok|ed, and unrea&s;onable interference of a wicked com|bination in her internal concerns. And as &s;incerely as we lamented the exce&s;&s;es, which, till lately, di&s;|graced the glorious cau&s;e in which France was en|gaged; and as much as we dete&s;ted the &s;anguinary mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by a faction within her; the American people had di&s;cernment enough to know,
<PB N="11" REF="029830_0009_0FE2777FF0D6F1E8">that the&s;e exce&s;&s;es were not to be attributed to the cau&s;e in which &s;he was engaged; and they had can|dour enough to trace them to their true &s;ource. They knew that great convul&s;ions were inevitable in &s;o great a revolution, and that violent mea&s;ures were to be expected in the exertions of a people, who were engaged with zeal and re&s;olution in cru&s;hing an an|cient and e&s;tabli&s;hed tyranny; and &s;till felt the deep|e&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e, who had been the in&s;tru|ments of their oppre&s;&s;ion, and who, they naturally &s;uppo&s;ed, were wi&s;hing to prolong it. They were aware, befides, that the open inva&s;ion of France by the combined powers, and their &s;ecret intrigues in the heart of the country, by exa&s;perating the friends of the revolution, by &s;owing jealou&s;ies and di&s;tru&s;t among the leaders of it, and fomenting faction in every form through the nation, were the principal cau&s;es, to which were to be imputed the &s;hocking &s;cenes, which ca&s;t a deep &s;hade over the dawn of freedom in that country.</P>
<P>The American people, in general, have wi&s;hed well to the cau&s;e of the French, through every &s;tage of the revolution; at the &s;ame time that they had to lament it &s;hould be the occa&s;ion of &s;o much incidental mi&s;ery, and &s;uch &s;hocking &s;cenes of wanton cruelty and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>This partiality of the Americans to the cau&s;e of the French, expre&s;&s;ed perhaps by individuals too
<PB N="12" REF="029830_0010_0FE2778BDC3396D8">&s;trongly and pointedly for a neutral power, operated as an encouragement to them to employ every effort to engage us to take an active part in their cau&s;e; at the &s;ame time it awakened the jealou&s;y of &s;ome of the combined powers, and might probably be one occa|&s;ion of the unfriendly and ho&s;tile mode of treatment adopted toward us by the Briti&s;h court.</P>
<P>Thus were we expo&s;ed to the attempts of one na|tion to draw us into the war, which through the arts of an intriguing mini&s;ter had nearly proved effectual; while by another we were provoked by various in&s;ults, and by acts of robbery, outrage, and ho&s;tility chal|lenged to un&s;heath the &s;word.</P>
<P>To defeat the views and fru&s;trate the expectations of tho&s;e, who wi&s;hed us to take part with them in the war, in &s;uch a manner as to pre&s;erve at the &s;ame time their friend&s;hip and confidence; and to &s;upport our national con&s;equence with tho&s;e, who had gro&s;sly in|&s;ulted and injured us, without drawing the &s;word to re&s;ent the in&s;ult, and &s;eek &s;atisfaction for the injury; required in our government more wi&s;dom and ad|dre&s;s, and more coolne&s;s and moderation united with firmne&s;s, than generally fall to the lot of men, to whom are entru&s;ted the affairs of nations.</P>
<P>And the difficulty of conducting in &s;uch a manner as to avoid taking a &s;ide in the European war was increa&s;ed by &s;everal inau&s;picious circum&s;tances a|mong our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="029830_0011_0FE2778D71561C98">
There were &s;ome men among us &s;o regardle&s;s of the common good, and entirely under the influence of &s;elfi&s;h views, as to rejoice in the pro&s;pect of war, from the hope of ri&s;ing to wealth by the calamities of their country. There were with us, as there are in all countries, men who are impatient of the linger|ing proce&s;s of indu&s;try and regular bu&s;ine&s;s to make their fortune. To &s;uch men war pre&s;ents the mo&s;t fa&s;cinating pro&s;pects. Having, before their eyes, ex|amples of enormous e&s;tates very ea&s;ily and rapidly ama&s;&s;ed, in the cour&s;e of the late revolution in this country, by privateering, and various kinds of &s;pecu|lation, which war, and its con&s;equence, a general derangement of affairs, never fail to pre&s;ent; they dream of nothing but war and revolution: and nothing will &s;atisfy their avaricious de&s;ires, till by war they can be furni&s;hed with an ea&s;y and expe|ditious way of ri&s;ing to opulence; or by producing internal confu&s;ion, and effecting a change in the or|der of things, they can avail them&s;elves of the gene|ral convul&s;ion and &s;hift of property to &s;ecure an am|ple &s;hare to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Characters of this de&s;cription abounded in every part of the Union; and they were not deficient in exertions, nor very &s;crupulous in their mea&s;ures, to engage others with them in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>They were joined by all the re&s;tle&s;s, ambitious, and di&s;appointed per&s;ons, who, having abilities
<PB N="14" REF="029830_0012_0FE2778F00E74320">which rendered them dangerous, but wanting tho&s;e virtues which beget re&s;pect and confidence in man|kind, had been defeated in their ambitious and a&s;|piring views by the good &s;en&s;e and caution of the people. Stimulated at once by ambition, chagrin and refentment, the&s;e men were ready to join in a mea&s;ure, which furni&s;hed &s;o alluring a pro&s;pect of producing a revolution in government, or changing the pre&s;ent order of things in &s;uch a manner, as to give them an opportunity of ri&s;ing to eminence and di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Some were advocates for war from an opinion that the national honour required it. Some, becau&s;e they cheri&s;hed an old grudge again&s;t Great-Britain, and, without attending well to the probable con&s;e|quences of the mea&s;ure, were ready to &s;eize on any opportunity to manife&s;t their re&s;entment. And &s;ome there were, who thought this country obliged, either by treaty or by the principle of gratitude, to engage actively with France in her conte&s;t again&s;t the enemies of her freedom and independence.</P>
<P>It happened unfortunately that within the United States were many citizens deeply indebted to Briti&s;h merchants. A rupture with Great-Britain pre&s;ent|ed a certain pro&s;pect of either an entire extinction of tho&s;e debts, or at lea&s;t a delay of the term of pay|ment.&mdash; And we cannot but lament that the language employed, and mea&s;ures propo&s;ed by &s;ome influen|tial
<PB N="15" REF="029830_0013_0FE27792B31E5D60">members of Congre&s;s were &s;uch, as to expo&s;e them to the &s;u&s;picion of acting under the influence of this con&s;ideration. Candour, however, and a regard to the honour of our country would lead us to hope, that no man, entru&s;ted with a &s;hare in the manage|ment of our national concerns, would advi&s;e to mea|&s;ures obviou&s;ly tending to involve the whole country in a ruinous war, for the &s;ake of relieving &s;ome in|dividuals, in the &s;tate to which he belonged, from the nece&s;&s;ity of paying their ju&s;t debts.</P>
<P>The &s;everal characters and de&s;criptions of men which have been mentioned, be&s;ides their own direct exertions, had their &s;everal &s;pheres of influence; and being joined in their mea&s;ures by the di&s;orderly, the di&s;contented, the enemies of the Federal Government, and tho&s;e who were di&s;affected on account of its general operation, or particular parts of its admini|&s;tration, they con&s;tituted a very formidable faction in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The more effectually to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;es, they in&s;tituted &s;ocieties in imitation of the jacobin clubs in France; and in order to &s;trengthen their party and carry into effect their de&s;igns, they had re|cour&s;e to mea&s;ures which mu&s;t have &s;unk a good cau&s;e into di&s;repute,&mdash;a bad one it rendered infa|mous. By &s;editious and inflammatory publications they endeavoured to poi&s;on the public mind,&mdash;to deceive the people,&mdash;to excite their jealou&s;y, and rou&s;e their pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="029830_0014_0FE2779DED944620">
The enemies of peace and order were greatly aided in their de&s;igns, by finding, in &s;everal parts of the Union, printers of news-papers, who regarded &s;o little their duty to the public, as to devote their pre&s;&s;es to the cau&s;e of &s;edition, and to &s;uffer fal&s;ehood, &s;lander, and mi&s;repre&s;entation to flow copiou&s;ly in tho&s;e pa|pers, which &s;hould have been &s;acredly employed as the vehicles of public in&s;truction and political in|formation. In tho&s;e papers they defamed and abu&s;ed public characters,&mdash;they mi&s;repre&s;ented and cen&s;ured the mea&s;ures of government,&mdash;they endeavoured to ca&s;t an odium on the mo&s;t meritorious officers of government on account of their mo&s;t meritorious actions, and thus to de&s;troy the public confidence in them. They abu&s;ed the Pre&s;ident for exerting his con&s;titutional authority in order to pre&s;erve our peace. They vilified and traduced tho&s;e mem|bers of Congre&s;s, who advocated moderate and pa|cific mea&s;ures; holding them up to public dete&s;ta|tion as lukewarm patriots, as being under Briti&s;h influence,&mdash;friends to Great-Britain, and enemies to their country. Their &s;peeches they mutilated, and handed &s;craps of them to the public in &s;uch a form, and &s;o detached from their connection, as entirely to pervert their meaning, and convey &s;entiments which were never entertained by their authors.</P>
<P>By the circulation of tho&s;e papers, &s;u&s;picions were &s;own among the people, the public &s;entiment was
<PB N="17" REF="029830_0015_0FE2779F79BE8C08">mi&s;led, and the public feelings agitated. And the &s;pirit of di&s;order, unea&s;ine&s;s, and oppo&s;ition, by which the public tranquility was threatened in every part of the Union, in one part of it actually broke out in avowed oppo&s;ition to the laws, and open re|bellion again&s;t the government.</P>
<P>The&s;e, which I have mentioned, are &s;ome of the leading circum&s;tances, which have operated to di&s;|turb our internal tranquility,&mdash;threatened to &s;hake the fabric of our government&mdash;thus endangered our freedom, and rendered it difficult for the friends of peace, in the admini&s;tration of government, to pre|vent our country from being entangled in the Euro|pean war.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the&s;e ob&s;tacles to the continuance of peace and tranquility, through the wi&s;e and &s;ea&s;on|able mea&s;ures adopted by the Pre&s;ident, and the faithful exertions of the friends of peace and order in Congre&s;s, &s;upported by the concurrence of public &s;entiment, and accompanied with the &s;miles of hea|ven, we yet enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing of peace; and a fair pro&s;pect, which is daily brightening, that we &s;hall continue to enjoy it under circum&s;tances highly ad|vantageous, and con&s;i&s;tent with public faith and na|tional honour. Rejoicing in the continuance of peace, and the check, which has been given to a &s;pirit of di&s;order and in&s;urrection; we have rea&s;on to ble&s;s the day, when the friends of peace and advocates of
<PB N="18" REF="029830_0016_0FE277A10A039D28">moderate mea&s;ures prevailed over tho&s;e, who, by ra&s;h and violent proceedings, would have precipitated our country into a ruinous war. And we have the further &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing, that the leaders of faction are lo&s;ing their influence,&mdash;that the hone&s;t and well|meaning citizens, who had been duped by their ar|tifices, and betrayed into their mea&s;ures, begin to be undeceived,&mdash;and that the &s;ocieties, which had arro|gantly u&s;urped the prerogative of the people, and were endeavouring to dictate to their repre&s;entative government, and to controul its mea&s;ures, are fa&s;t dwindling into in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>To the continuance of peace, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of in&s;urrection, and the triumph of order it is chiefly owing, that this country is, in other re&s;pects, in &s;o flouri&s;hing a condition.</P>
<P>It requires but little di&s;cernment and only com|mon attention to perceive, that the unexampled pro&s;perity of the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of our citizens, our rapid improvement in agriculture and manufactures, the &s;urpri&s;ing increa&s;e of our commerce and naviga|tion, the prodigious acce&s;&s;ion of wealth and &s;trength to the community at large, and the ea&s;y circum&s;tan|ces of the inhabitants in general, of every cla&s;s, are chiefly owing to that regular cour&s;e of things, which &s;everal years peace, a good government, and internal tranquility have produced. And nothing is more certain, than that all the&s;e marks of pro&s;perity mu&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="029830_0017_0FE277A2986C3E38">receive a check, and &s;ome of them perhaps be utter|ly annihilated, were we to engage in a war with any of the European powers, or were our government to be materially &s;hocked by faction.</P>
<P>There never was a time heretofore when this country was in &s;o flouri&s;hing a condition, and made &s;o re&s;pectable a figure abroad, as it does at this day. Among many other evidences of our increa&s;ing wealth, power, and importance, it is particularly worthy of our pre&s;ent notice, that notwith&s;tanding the long and expen&s;ive war by which we purcha&s;ed our independence, the re&s;ources of the United States are &s;uch, as to enable them to pay, with a great deal of ea&s;e, the intere&s;t of the public debt; and that the pre&s;ent debates in Congre&s;s, on the reduction of the public debt, di&s;cover to us that there is ability in the nation and a di&s;po&s;ition in our government, by a pretty rapid proce&s;s to &s;ink the principal. It is highly honorary to the United States, and a &s;ource of con&s;olation to the citizens; that, while other na|tions, already burdened with debt to the utmo&s;t ex|tent of their re&s;ources, are yet madly plunging into the mo&s;t ruinous wars to add to their embarra&s;&s;|ments; it is the enlightened policy of our govern|ment to avail it&s;elf of the pre&s;ent pro&s;perity to relieve the country of exi&s;ting debt, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of increa&s;ing it, and to prolong that peace and pro&s;perity, which furni&s;h the only hope of its final extinction.</P>

The &s;ucce&s;s, which has attended the late negocia|tion with the court of Great-Britain, furni&s;hes anoth|er proof of our national re&s;pectability. We have authentic, though not official notice, that the En|voy Extraordinary, lately &s;ent by our Supreme Ex|ecutive to the Briti&s;h court, on bu&s;ine&s;s of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting nature, has effected the de&s;ign of his mi&s;|&s;ion. This &s;ucce&s;s, while it evinces that our friend|&s;hip is of &s;ome importance in the e&s;timation of other powers, we have rea&s;on to hope and expect, will contribute much to our future pro&s;perity and hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>To enumerate the marks of private pro&s;perity would lead me beyond the limits of a &s;ermon. It is, be&s;ides, unnece&s;&s;ary. They are &s;een and felt by all the inhabitants of our land. That people in general of nearly every cla&s;s and occupation enjoy a &s;tate of unu&s;ual pro&s;perity; that the means of a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence were never more than now within the reach of all; that indu&s;try and enterprize in every line of life are highly encouraged&mdash;that they receive a &s;ure and ample reward&mdash;and that this reward is well &s;ecured to him who earns it, are facts &s;o obvious, that they can neither be overlooked nor conte&s;ted.</P>
<P>Equally certain it is, that we live under a mild and free government; as mild and free as we can bear&mdash;a government, under which each individual has given up as few of his natural rights, as is con|&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="21" REF="029830_0019_0FE277B1E0535460">with the &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the re&s;t in a &s;tate of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>For all the&s;e public ble&s;&s;ings and marks of private pro&s;perity, which di&s;tingui&s;h our condition as a peo|ple and as individuals, let the ju&s;t tribute of our uni|ted thanks a&s;cend this day, as an acceptable &s;acrifice, to that God, by who&s;e providence we enjoy them all.</P>
<P>And while, with hearts deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of our obligations, we unitedly prai&s;e the Lord for the&s;e indications of divine benignity; piou&s;ly noticing the foot&s;teps of a kind providence in our na|tional concerns: the proclamation directs us, <Q>at the &s;ame time humbly and fervently to be&s;eech the kind Author of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings graciou&s;ly to prolong them to us, and to imprint on our hearts a deep and &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of our obligations to him for them.</Q></P>
<P>While we hold in ju&s;t e&s;timation the patriotic ex|ertions of tho&s;e men, who were in&s;trumental in fra|ming and e&s;tabli&s;hing the happy government under which we live, as well as of tho&s;e who have been the means of pre&s;erving to us the great ble&s;&s;ing of peace, and promoting our pro&s;perity; let us yet always bear in mind, that, in effecting the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed ends, they were but the in&s;truments of that providence, which rules over all; and that our fir&s;t acknowlegements are due to <HI>the Father of lights, from whom comes down every good and perfect gift.</HI></P>

This direction of the Pre&s;ident to expre&s;s a pious &s;en&s;e of dependence on the great Governor of the world is peculiarly &s;ea&s;onable at the pre&s;ent day, when we are in &s;o great danger of imbiding the athe|i&s;tic &s;entiments &s;o openly avowed and publicly coun|tenanced by a nation, with which we have clo&s;e con|nections and con&s;tant intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>The French people, as was naturally to be expect|ed, in their zeal to de&s;troy every ve&s;tige of the an|cient tyranny and &s;uper&s;tition, have gone to a la|mentable exce&s;s on the other extreme. They have too evidently confounded government with tyranny, and religion with &s;uper&s;tition. We are not however to imagine, as has been too ha&s;tily believed by &s;ome, that the French are become a <HI>nation of athei&s;ts.</HI>&mdash;Yet it is certain that a very con&s;iderable proportion of the nation have exploded all religion; and, in &s;ome of their mo&s;t public and &s;olemn acts, their government has virtually rejected the doctrine of a God govern|ing the world by his providence. While we put a candid con&s;truction on the pre&s;ent infidelity and ir|religion of the French, attributing it to their zeal to exterminate all &s;uper&s;tition; and while we hope and believe that, ere long, they will vibrate back again to &s;ome rational &s;y&s;tem of religion, we cannot be too careful to avoid the contagion of their pre&s;ent prin|ciples.</P>
<P>Next to acknowleging the hand from which our
<PB N="23" REF="029830_0021_0FE277B71641CCB8">ble&s;&s;ings flow, it is nece&s;&s;ary for us <Q>rightly to e&s;ti|mate their immen&s;e value.</Q> If we e&s;timate our public ble&s;&s;ings according to their worth, we &s;hall never be willing to &s;acrifice them to private intere&s;t, party prejudices, national pride, pa&s;&s;ion, or re&s;ent|ment. It will be our wi&s;h to prolong them to the late&s;t period, and to pre&s;erve them unimpaired.</P>
<P>We are directed to pray, that God would <Q>pre|&s;erve us from the arrogance of pro&s;perity, and from hazarding the advantages we enjoy by delu&s;ive pur&s;uits.</Q></P>
<P>Nations are apt to grow arrogant and pre&s;umptu|ous, as they become rich and powerful; and wan|tonly to engage in de&s;tructive wars, which &s;erve to exhau&s;t the trea&s;ures, and wa&s;te the &s;trength of the country, to contaminate the morals of the people, and, by a certain proce&s;s, to corrupt their govern|ment and undermine their liberties. They will &s;ac|rifice the lives and property of the inhabitants to na|tional pride and re&s;entment; and, in&s;tead of endea|vouring to reconcile differences with other nations by fair negociation, will bring the heavie&s;t calamities on the country, by appealing to the &s;word for de|ci&s;ion on the mo&s;t trifling occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Another danger to which we are expo&s;ed by pro&s;|perity is, that, as we increa&s;e in wealth, we &s;hall progre&s;s in luxury; that di&s;tinctions in &s;ociety will be marked by &s;tronger lines, as we depart from that
<PB N="24" REF="029830_0022_0FE277C11DB3F160">mediocrity of condition, which, as yet, very much di&s;tingui&s;hes the &s;ituation of the inhabitants of this country; and that, as inequality of condition gradu|ally increa&s;es, we &s;hall gradually lo&s;e our republican &s;entiments and manners, and with them our repub|lican form of government. God forbid this &s;hould ever be the ca&s;e! But certainly there is a natural tendency toward it, which it requires &s;ome care both in the Government and in the people to guard again&s;t.</P>
<P>The body of the people, e&s;pecially in the middle and lower walks of life, mu&s;t cheri&s;h the republican virtues. They mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed by indu&s;try, frugality, and temperance; &s;o as to maintain their individual freedom and independence, and prevent the wealth, and with it the power of the community, from &s;ettling into the hands of a few.</P>
<P>And the Government would do well to &s;et the peo|ple an example of republican plainne&s;s and frugality. Were per&s;ons in high office in government to di&s;|countenance by their example the introduction of luxury, extravagance, and di&s;&s;ipation, it might have con&s;iderable influence on the manners of &s;ociety at large. They may further &s;ub&s;erve e&s;&s;entially the public good by pur&s;uing regular and uniform mea|&s;ures in the admini&s;tration of government; by a fixt and permanent policy; and by holding up as few objects of &s;peculation as po&s;&s;ible, which &s;erve to di&s;|courage the exertions of patient indu&s;try, by enabling
<PB N="25" REF="029830_0023_0FE277C2B1783710">enterprizing individuals, and often the lea&s;t u&s;eful members of the community, to acquire large fortunes without indu&s;try, and without pur&s;uing any regular bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident's caution again&s;t delu&s;ive pur&s;uits, which endanger the advantages we now enjoy, re|minds us of certain commercial regulations propo&s;ed in Congre&s;s for the purpo&s;e of promoting the com|mercial intere&s;t of the country. Upon thorough examination of their nature and tendency it appeared that they mu&s;t, in the i&s;&s;ue, have operated extremely to our di&s;advantage. This being the ca&s;e, the adop|tion of them with the expectation of their promoting our advantage mu&s;t have proved a very delu&s;ive pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>It reminds us of the vigorous effort afterward made, by taking advantage of the general indigna|tion at the depredations made on our commerce by the Briti&s;h in the We&s;t-Indies, to &s;tir up the people and the government to acts of ho&s;tility in return. Be&s;ides the numberle&s;s incidental calamities of war, the expo&s;ure of the lives and property of the citizens, &s;uch a mea&s;ure mu&s;t have brought on us, it mu&s;t have been the occa&s;ion of increa&s;ing beyond all calcula|tion our public debt, and in equal proportion aug|menting our public burdens.</P>
<P>A more delu&s;ive pur&s;uit can &s;carcely be imagined, than that of plunging a nation in war to obtain in|demnification
<PB N="26" REF="029830_0024_0FE277C44710F9A8">for injuries, which, if obtained, would pay but an incon&s;iderable part of the probable ex|pences of the war. E&s;pecially where any hope re|mains of an amicable adju&s;tment of difficulties by negociation.</P>
<P>It leads us again to think of the clamours, daily made again&s;t our government by per&s;ons, who would make the people believe it too ari&s;tocratic in its form and oppre&s;&s;ive in its operation.</P>
<P>Under our pre&s;ent government, where each man is fairly reprefented, where all, except in a very few ca&s;es of incapacity, are alike candidates for office, and every public officer is &s;ubject to the law, and ac|countable for his conduct in office, there is as much freedom and equality as can exi&s;t with &s;ocial order. Every attempt to le&s;&s;en the confidence of the people in their public &s;ervants, to &s;pread di&s;content and jealou&s;y, to foment a &s;pirit of faction, to excite in|&s;urrection or oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ures of govern|ment; and all mi&s;repre&s;entations of the de&s;igns and mea&s;ures of men in office, have a certain tendency to undermine and de&s;troy, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing, the freedom of the people. This the leaders of faction know. But they have popular themes of declama|tion with which to deceive the people; and they have it in their power, by di&s;gui&s;ing well their real views, to delude into their mea&s;ures many hone&s;t and firm friends to <HI>liberty with order.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="029830_0025_0FE277C5D711BF18">
Equally unfriendly to the continuance of liberty and equal rights are the popular &s;ocieties e&s;tabli&s;hed in this country as checks on our government. Whatever may be their pretences to democratic principles, they con&s;titute a dangerous ari&s;tocracy. They are incon&s;i&s;tent with any permanent govern|ment, as they tend to keep a country in a &s;tate of perpetual revolution. In the hi&s;tory of France for three years pa&s;t we have melancholy evidence, that they put it in the power of a few popular and am|bitious individuals to controul the operations of the repre&s;entatives of the people, and in effect to exer|ci&s;e the whole power of the government.</P>
<P>A &s;pirit of jealou&s;y is the &s;oul of a republican government. By watching faithfully the mea&s;ures of government, the people have it in their power to keep in office tho&s;e men who &s;erve them with &s;idel|ity, and pur&s;ue mea&s;ures promotive of the general good, and to di&s;place tho&s;e who do not.</P>
<P>But this is a &s;ervice they can only perform them|&s;elves. It is not capable of being delegated to oth|ers. They can neither with propriety nor &s;afety en|tru&s;t it in the hands of men they do not know; men who have nothing to recommend them to public confidence, but their own high preten&s;ions to ex|alted patrioti&s;m and concern for the liberties of the people&mdash;preten&s;ions, which none but their own &s;o|ciety have acknowleged, and which we do not
<PB N="28" REF="029830_0026_0FE277D1E1B3D2A8">know that they have ever &s;upported by actual ex|ertions for the public good.</P>
<P>While, as friends to order, we reprobate all com|binations of men for the purpo&s;e of oppo&s;ing, em|barra&s;&s;ing, or controuling the operations of govern|ment, or influencing elections; as friends to liberty, we &s;hould cheri&s;h a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y, and earne&s;tly wi&s;h that all might be vigilant in guarding their rights, and in preventing the corruption of govern|ment, and checking its tendency toward de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>The prayer of David re&s;pecting tho&s;e, who were combined again&s;t him and oppo&s;ed his wi&s;e govern|ment, &s;eems peculiarly applicable to the combina|tions again&s;t our Federal Government. <HI>Slay them not, le&s;t my people forget; &s;catter them by thy power, and bring them down.</HI> It is not to be wi&s;hed that oppo&s;ition &s;hould be wholly extingui&s;hed. It would be an unfavourable &s;ymptom. It would denote a political lethargy. But it is de&s;irable that it &s;hould be prevented from ri&s;ing to exce&s;s, and, by powerful combinations of men, &s;haking the fabric of govern|ment. A little fermentation gives a proper anima|tion and vigour to the body politic; but, carried to exce&s;s, it produces convul&s;ions, which threaten di&s;|&s;olution.</P>
<P>Again. We are not to expect the continuance of our pre&s;ent advantages, unle&s;s we <Q>merit it by not
<PB N="29" REF="029830_0027_0FE277D3F4461098">abu&s;ing them, by our gratitude for them, and by a corre&s;ponding conduct as citizens, and as men.</Q></P>
<P>We &s;hall be guilty of abu&s;ing our advantages, if, as a nation, or as individuals, we become vain, pre|&s;umptuous, and in&s;en&s;ible of our obligations; cor|rupt and licentious in our manners, regardle&s;s of the principles of piety and morality, and inattentive to religious obligation and &s;ocial duties. And we &s;hall de&s;erve to lo&s;e our excellent government and the freedom it &s;ecures, if we ever become, on the one hand, &s;o inattentive to our rights, as to allow the government to become oppre&s;&s;ive; or &s;uffer in|triguing men, on the other hand, to amu&s;e us with the idea of more perfect freedom, &s;o as to undermine the principles of our excellent con&s;titution, and by their in&s;idious manoeuvres to excite di&s;content, and produce a revolution.</P>
<P>While our primary and principal view, in im|proving with fidelity our national advantages, and making <Q>our conduct as citizens and as men, cor|re&s;pondent to them,</Q> is to &s;ecure and perpetuate thereby our individual intere&s;t and the common good of our country; it is natural and ju&s;t for us to make it a &s;econdary con&s;ideration, at a time when the con|vul&s;ions of Europe oblige &s;o many to quit their na|tive countries and &s;eek a &s;ecure and peaceful retreat abroad, <Q>to render this country a &s;afe and propitious a&s;ylum to the unfortunate of other countries:</Q>
<PB N="30" REF="029830_0028_0FE277D585E99C60">and, with our faithful exertions, to join our united and fervent prayers for this happy effect.</P>
<P>While we again pray, <Q>that true and u&s;eful knowlege may be extended among us, and that habits of &s;obriety, order, morality and piety may be diffu&s;ed and e&s;tabli&s;hed,</Q> let us accompany our prayers with the mo&s;t zealous and faithful exertions to promote the&s;e de&s;irable ends.</P>
<P>As long as the inhabitants of this country &s;hall be attentive to the &s;ubject of education, extending pub|lic advantages, as is now done in this and &s;ome of the other &s;tates in the union, to the children of every cla&s;s of citizens; and as long as we &s;hall be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the general prevalence of the habits of <HI>&s;obriety, order, morality and piety,</HI> there can be no dan|ger of our lo&s;ing the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom and good government. But, certain it is, the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings will be no longer ours, when tho&s;e habits &s;hall be lo&s;t, and the general exten&s;ion of the means of education &s;hall be neglected. We &s;hall always have a govern|ment &s;uited to our character. Freedom and order can be &s;upported only in an enlightened and virtu|ous community. Ignorance and vice require the &s;everer di&s;cipline of arbitrary power. And it is their natural tendency to introduce it.</P>
<P>When we extend our view to other countries, in many of them we meet with &s;triking evidences of the ju&s;tice of this la&s;t remark. We find that igno|rance
<PB N="31" REF="029830_0029_0FE277D715A3EEA8">and &s;uper&s;tition, and a prevalence of bad mor|als are the &s;upport of de&s;potic power.</P>
<P>Our &s;atisfaction in contemplating the flouri&s;hing condition and bright pro&s;pects of the United States is checked, when we contra&s;t with it the calamities of other nations, which are either oppre&s;&s;ed by de&s;|potic power, involved in the mi&s;eries of de&s;tructive war, or &s;truggling with faction at home and conflict|ing with foes abroad in the cau&s;e of liberty.</P>
<P>Enjoying our&s;elves the &s;weets of peace, freedom, &s;ocial order, and pro&s;perity, and &s;ympathizing in the &s;ufferings of tho&s;e to whom the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are de|nied, let it be our fervent and devout prayer to Al|mighty God, <Q>that all the ble&s;&s;ings we po&s;&s;e&s;s or a&s;k for our&s;elves, may be imparted to the whole family of mankind.</Q></P>
