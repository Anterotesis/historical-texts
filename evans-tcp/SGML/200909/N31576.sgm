<P>SEEING HIS DAYS ARE DETERMINED, THE NUMBER OF HIS MONTHS ARE WITH THEE, THOU HAST APPOINTED HIS BOUNDS THAT HE CANNOT PASS.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DEATH, is a melancholy Subject to employ our Meditations; yet a Subject we have daily Occa&s;ion, with all Seriou&s;ne&s;s, to bear upon our Minds, and are frequently invited, by particular Occurrences of di|vine Providence, to contemplate: It is a Change &s;o cer|tain, and, withal, &s;o very important, view'd in it&s;elf, and its Con&s;equences, that it highly concerns the <HI>Li|ving</HI> to enter into the mo&s;t frequent and affecting Con|&s;ideration of it. 'Tis peculiarly fit and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> do, when we are pre&s;ented with In&s;tances of Mortality; e&s;pecially &s;uch remarkable and &s;triking In&s;tances the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">|of, as loudly admoni&s;h us of our exceeding Frailty, and utter uncertainty of Life, and naturally &s;ugge&s;ts a Va|riety of u&s;eful Thoughts and Reflections. Such is the awful Occurrence of divine Providence which hath brought us together at this Time. The Occa&s;ion is indeed very &s;olemn and &s;orrowful, and demands our mo&s;t &s;erious and awakened Attention. We are here pre&s;ented with &s;uch a Spectacle as our Eyes never &s;aw before&mdash;with &s;uch a Scene of Mourning and Wo, as we are unu&s;ed to, con&s;idered in all its Circum&s;tances. Behold! there lie the <HI>Corp&s;es</HI> of three YOUNG MEN, lately cut down in the Prime of Life not in the ordina|ry Way, but by one in&s;tantaneous Blow, quick and &s;ud|den as the <HI>Lightning's</HI> Fla&s;h! There &s;it the &s;orrowful
<PB N="6" REF="041713_0005_101B1161C43F20B0">Parents, and other &s;urviving Relatives of the Decea&s;ed, deeply touched with the &s;udden and &s;hocking Event, and &s;adly bewailing their Lo&s;s; who&s;e Affliction be|&s;peaks our friendly Sympathy and Compa&s;&s;ion, in &s;ome &s;uch Language as that in Job xix. 21. <HI>Have Pity upon me, have Pity upon me, O ye my Friends, for the Hand of God hath touched me.</HI> And &s;hall we not all be affected with this &s;orrowful Event, and, as both the Law of Na|ture and Chri&s;tianity dictates, lament the &s;udden and untimely Death of the&s;e <HI>young Men,</HI> and mourn with them that mourn?</P>
<P>BUT then it behoves both the Bereaved, and Us, to regulate our Thoughts, Affections, and Behavior, on this &s;orrowful Occa&s;ion, by the Rules of Piety and Vir|tue, and to manife&s;t a due Reverence and Regard to GOD, the &s;upreme Governor of the World, and righte|ous Di&s;po&s;er of all Events; by who&s;e ju&s;t Decree, and unchangable Appointment, the Sentence of Death is pa&s;&s;ed upon all Mankind, and who&s;e all-governing Pro|vidence determines the Number of every Man's Days, and the particular Time, and Manner of his Death. Accordingly I have cho&s;en the Words of the Text, now read, to entertain you with, on this mournful Occa&s;ion. <HI>Seeing his Days are determined, the Number of his Months are with thee, thou ho&s;t appointed his Bounds that he can|not pa&s;s.</HI> They are the Words of pious <HI>Job,</HI> which he uttered in the Day of his &s;ore Calamity, when he was greatly oppre&s;&s;ed, in Body and Mind, with the Mi&s;eries of human Life. In the 1&s;t and 2d <HI>Ver&s;es,</HI> he expre&s;&s;es an affectionate and &s;orrowful Sen&s;e of the Brevity, Trou|bles, and Uncertainty of human Life: <HI>Man that is born of a Woman, is of few Days, and full of Trouble: He cometh forth like a Flower, and is cut down; he fleeth al&s;o as a Shadow, and continueth not.</HI> This he repre&s;ents as a general or univer&s;al Ca&s;e. And, in the Text, he u&s;es &s;everal Expre&s;&s;ions, importing the divine Sovereignty, and Prerogative, in di&s;po&s;ing of Man, determining the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of his Days and Months upon Earth, and fix|ing
<PB N="7" REF="041713_0006_101B1163B33B1108">the Period of Life, beyond which none can pa&s;s. This Truth, well attended to, affords &s;ea&s;onable and u&s;eful Reflections, proper to influence and direct our Temper and Behavior, under the trouble&s;ome Occur|rences that befal us; and may &s;erve, e&s;pecially, to com|po&s;e us to Re&s;ignation and Contentment, under &s;orrow|ful Bereavments. The <HI>Truth</HI> then, to be illu&s;trated and improved, is this, viz.</P>
<Q>That Man's Days upon Earth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of his Months, are preci&s;ely determined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, and the Time and Manner of his Death fined, which he cannot pa&s;s or avoid.</Q>

</LIST>
<P N="1">I. <HI>I &s;hall &s;ay Something by Way of Illu&s;tration of this Truth.</HI> That Mankind are Mortal, and de&s;tin'd to a &s;hort Continuance here, is indi&s;putable Fact. The Sen|tence of Death is pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, without any Li|mitation, or Di&s;tinction. And however different they may be, in other Re&s;pects, there is this one Event, that comes alike to them. <HI>Is there not an appointed Time to Man upon Earth? Are not his Days al&s;o as the Days of on Hireling?</HI> Job vii. 1. <HI>It is appointed unto Man once to die,</HI> Heb ix. 27. The Cau&s;e hereof is a&s;&s;igned by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. v. 11. <HI>Wherefore, as by one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin; and &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, for that all have &s;inned.</HI> But though Death be the common Lot of <HI>All,</HI> and none are exempted from it, yet there is a great Variety, as to the Time, Manner, and Circum&s;tances of it, con&s;idered with Re&s;pect to <HI>In|dividuals.</HI> There is no &s;tated Time, no certain Number of <HI>Days, Months,</HI> or <HI>Years</HI> fixed, to which every One lives that is born into the World, and beyond which no One doth pa&s;s; but Some are de&s;tin'd to a longer, and O|thers to a &s;horter Stay in the World. This Matter is under the immediate Conduct of a mo&s;t wi&s;e and righ|teous Providence, and all Things, relative to it are ad|ju&s;ted
<PB N="8" REF="041713_0007_101B1166C6FB6250">by the unerring Wi&s;dom of the &s;upreme Lord of All, and &s;overeign Di&s;po&s;er of all Events that take Place in the World. In GOD's Hand is the Life and Breath of all Mankind; and he claims it as his Prerogative to kill, and to &s;ave alive. Every Man that comes into the World, is entirely dependant upon GOD for his Pre&s;er|vation and Continuance in Life. He that gave us Life, and Being, limits the Time of Life to every One, ac|cording to the Plea&s;ure of his own Will. The Time when, the Manner how, and the Place where, he &s;hall make his Exit, is determined by Him. <HI>His Days</HI> even <HI>the Number of his Months are with God,</HI> and, deter|mined by him, the Bounds to which he &s;hall come, and beyond which he &s;hall not pa&s;s, are fixed by his unchangable Appointment. GOD, as the Author of Life and Death, acts herein with &s;overeign Power and Freedom, and a wi&s;e and uncontroulable Dominion, <HI>Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? Who will &s;ay unto him, What do&s;t thou?</HI>
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Job ix 12.</NOTE> Death, in every In&s;tance and in every Form, is GOD's providential Act: And, whenever he i&s;&s;ues forth the dread Command, and re|quires our Souls of us, we mu&s;t obey; nor can we, by any Means or Power whatever, re&s;i&s;t his Will, e&s;|cape the fatal Stroke, or put off the Execution of it to a longer Period. <HI>There is no Man that hath Power over the Spirit, to retain the Spirit; neither hath he Power in the Day of Death: And there is no Di&s;charge in that War.</HI>
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eccl. viii. 8.</NOTE> GOD does not, in this Part of his Admini&s;tration, pro|ceed by any fixed Rule, di&s;coverable by us, or that lie, open to our View; whereby we can know before Hand, the Time, Place, or Circum&s;tances of our own, or ano|ther's Death. This we can know and determine only by the Event; yet we have no Rea&s;on, upon this, or any other Account, to doubt, but that GOD always acts agreeable to his own fixed Plan, and that every Per&s;on's Death, u&s;ual as it may &s;eem to us, or by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> it is effected, takes Place exactly in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Time
<PB N="9" REF="041713_0008_101B116906C4F0D0">and Manner that is pre-determined by Him, and as be&s;t &s;uits with the Scheme of his perfect and all-wi&s;e Provi|dence. In many In&s;tances, indeed, GOD gives previ|ous Notice and Admonition of approaching Death, by Sickne&s;s and Di&s;ea&s;es; but oftentimes he &s;urprizes Per|&s;ons in a &s;udden and unexpected Manner, and cuts them off unawares: So that although Nothing is more certain than Death and <HI>the Living know that they &s;hall die,</HI> yet &s;carce any Thing is more uncertain, as to us, than the Time and Manner of this Change. We are ex|ceeding frail, at be&s;t, and liable to be de&s;troyed by in|numerable Means, which we can neither fore&s;ee, nor avoid. <HI>For</HI> (as the wi&s;e Preacher hath ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, Eccl. ix. 12.) <HI>Man al&s;o knoweth not his Time, as the Fi&s;hes that are taken in an evil Net, and as the Birds that are caught in the Snare; &s;o are the Sons of Men &s;nared in an evil Time, when it falleth &s;addenly upon them.</HI> And agreeable here|unto, he el&s;ewhere gives us this Caution, <HI>Boa&s;t not thy|&s;elf of Yo-Morrow, for thou knowe&s;t not what a Day may bring forth.</HI>
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxvii. 1.</NOTE> So ignorant and uncertain are we about future Events, that no Man, be the Pro&s;pect ever &s;o fair and promi&s;ing, knows what &s;hall happen to him in Time to come&mdash;what a Day, or an Hour, or even the very next Moment, will bring forth&mdash;whether he &s;hall be <HI>dead,</HI> or <HI>alive,</HI> in this World, or the next. Death, though a very great Change, may be &s;udden and in&s;tan|taneous. We &s;ee, in Fact, that it is without any Order, as to its Cour&s;e and Manner of Proceedure; not &s;eizing One after another in a regular Succe&s;&s;ion, according to their Age, or Place of Abode; but taking One here, and Another there; now an <HI>old,</HI> then a <HI>young</HI> Per&s;on, as the &s;overeign Lord of All hath determined; and that, in a Variety of Ways, and by different Means, Per&s;ons are removed out of the Land of the Living: Some are car|ried off by accute Di&s;tempers, others by lingering Di&s;|ea&s;es&mdash;&s;ome by the Hand of Violence, Others by &s;ud|den and unexpected Occurrences. It is manife&s;t to the Ob&s;ervation of all Mankind, that Some die in early
<PB N="10" REF="041713_0009_101B116B6C38B978"><HI>Infancy;</HI> Some in <HI>Childhood;</HI> Some in the Bloom and Vigor of <HI>Youth;</HI> Some in their <HI>full Strength, being whol|ly at Ea&s;e, having their Brea&s;ts full of Milk, and their Bones moi&s;tened with Morrow;</HI> and Some in the <HI>Mid&s;t of their Days</HI> and U&s;efulne&s;s; while Others live to <HI>a good old Age,</HI> and come to the Grave as a Shock of Corn in its Sea&s;on. In a Word, the Arrows of Death, the King of Terrors, fly &s;o promi&s;cuou&s;ly among our mortal race, that no Age, Rank or Condition of Men, is &s;ecure there|from. And no Man, &s;ecure, as he may &s;eem to be of Life, knows how &s;oon the Summons may be &s;ent to him to depart. Indeed, the Time and Manner of our Death is to us &s;uch an impenetrable Secret, as to leave us in the greate&s;t Uncertainty. And 'tis wi&s;ely &s;o or|dered in divine Providence, that we may be made the more &s;en&s;ible of our continual Dependence upon GOD, and more circum&s;pect and diligent in the Duties of Life, and may learn not to put too much Tru&s;t and Confi|dence in our&s;elves, or in any Man of like Frailty, <HI>who&s;e Breath is in their No&s;trils;</HI> but to place our Hope and Dependence upon <HI>the Lord Jehovah, with whom is ever|la&s;ting Strength</HI>&mdash;to commit our&s;elves to him in Well|doing, and refer it to him, to order and di&s;po&s;e, both of Us, and of all Ours, as, in his infinite Wi&s;dom, he &s;hall judge it to be right and be&s;t, mo&s;t for his own Glo|ry, and our eternal Intere&s;t and Welfare.</P>
<P>The Truth contained in the Words of the Text thus illu&s;trated, I proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>To make &s;ome Improvement of it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This Truth &s;ugge&s;ts to our View and Con&s;ideration, another and future State of Exi&s;tence, after the pre&s;ent Life &s;hall be terminated.</HI> For &s;ince this Life is &s;o &s;hort and uncertain, and the Number of our Days is determined by GOD, which we cannot pa&s;s, we may be morally certain, that we were made and de&s;igned, not for this World only, but al&s;o for another, a better and more cer|tain and la&s;ting State of Enjoyment. For is it rea&s;ona|bly to be imagined, that the infinitely wi&s;e and good Author of our Beings hath made &s;uch Creatures as we
<PB N="11" REF="041713_0010_101B116D896263B8">are, endowed with &s;uch Capacities and De&s;ires, as all worldly Things and Enjoyments cannot fully &s;atisfy; or, that he &s;hould place us in &s;uch a &s;hort, frail, dying World as this, which is &s;o full of Vexation and Trou|ble, and where no perfect Re&s;t and Happine&s;s is to be expected, without providing &s;ome better Things for us to come? The Perceptions, Reflections, and Enjoy|ments of the Soul, the &s;uperior Part of our Frame, are &s;ome of them &s;uch as clearly in licate its Di&s;tinction from, its Superiority to, and Independence on the Body, and that it may exi&s;t &s;eparate from, and independant on it: Nor can we, from the Death and Di&s;&s;olution of the Bo|dy, certainly infer the Death and De&s;truction of the Soul: On the Contrary, the Capacities and De&s;ires, the Years, and Hopes of the Soul, &s;trongly argue, not only its Spirituality, but its Immortality too; and that there is a future State, after this which is fini&s;hed at Death, wherein the Soul &s;hall exi&s;t, and God, the moral Go|vernor of the World, will more fully admini&s;ter Judg|ment to every One, according to his Deeds, than it ap|pears he does in this World, upon the Suppo&s;ition, that this is the only State, in which Men have to live. So far we may go upon the Principles of Rea&s;on: But this is far from being the cleare&s;t Evidence we have in the Ca&s;e. The Book of divine Revelation affords a more clear and certain Intelligence of a future State. This brings <HI>Life and Immortality to Light,</HI>
