<P>_THO' it be a little uncommon, to bring two Por|tions of Scripture, &s;ituated at &s;uch a Di&s;tance in the Bible, for the Text or Argument of one Di&s;cour&s;e; yet as the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, not only have &s;omething of a &s;imilar Sound, but have generally been judg'd to have very much the &s;ame Mean|ing; and as Expo&s;itors, however varying in their Comments on the one and the other, in Corre&s;pondence to their differing Views of the Context, and their differing Schemes in Divinity, have neverthele&s;s con&s;ider'd them as nearly parallel Scriptures, of

much the &s;ame Import, and capable of the &s;ame Application and U&s;e in Religion: therefore I have tho't it no Impropriety, to place them in Connection at the head of this Di&s;cour&s;e, in Order to compare them together, and di&s;cover the true Sen&s;e of the one by that Light the other reflects upon it; by which Means we &s;hall &s;ee how the <HI>Prophet</HI> and the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> and &s;o how both the Old Te&s;tament and the New, concur in pouring Contempt on the per&s;onal <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of Man, and di&s;paraging all the moral Attainments, even of the <HI>Be&s;t,</HI> as well as Wor&s;t of Mankind, under &s;ome limited Notions and Re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Both of the&s;e Scriptures &s;eem to have been mi&s;erably tortur'd by <HI>Papi&s;tical</HI> and other Writers, to pervert 'em to a fal&s;e Sen&s;e, and a wrong and dangerous U&s;e: while yet, in a fair and equitable Con&s;truction, they appear &s;ub&s;ervient to &s;ome of the mo&s;t excel|lent Purpo&s;es in Religion; to humble the fallen Creature, and exalt the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer; to rout all the vain Pretences of &s;elf-righteous Mortals; to conduct Sinners to Chri&s;t, as <HI>the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s unto every one that believeth;</HI> and to excite the <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> to <HI>live by Faith, doing all in the Name of Chri&s;t,</HI> while <HI>careful to maintain good Works.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophet ISAIAH (as <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in general have under|&s;tood and apply'd his Words) by the Spirit fore&s;eeing &s;ome future great Revolution in the Church, compo&s;es a prophetical Prayer, wherein this holy Man in the Name of the Converts of <HI>Zion</HI> makes that lowly Confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>All our Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are as filthy Rags.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle PAUL, for him&s;elf (but therein exhi|biting the <HI>communis Sen&s;us Fidelium,</HI> the genuine Sentiment and Spirit of every true Chri&s;tian) after having confe&s;&s;ed in relation to Time pa&s;t, that he had <HI>counted all Things but Lo&s;s, for the Ex|cellency of the Knowledge of Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;ubjoins this further Confe&s;&s;ion referring to the Time pre&s;ent, <HI>And I do count them but Dung, that I may win Chri&s;t, and be found in him, not having mine own Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the Law.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>It appears to me the principal Scope, as well of the Prophet, as the Apo&s;tle, to renounce all Preten&s;ions to <HI>Ju&s;tification by Works,</HI> and di&s;avow every Plea from <HI>righteous Self</HI> in point of reconciling or ingratiating Worthine&s;s before the Sovereign Lawgiver; to di&s;|claim <HI>Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in every Shape, and reject all Tho'ts of <HI>&s;tanding in the Judgment,</HI> upon the foot of per&s;onal Obedience to God's Law, the everla&s;ting Rule of <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash; They both u&s;e &s;trong and emphatical Language, that di&s;covers a profound Sen&s;e of the ab&s;olute In&s;ufficiency of the be&s;t <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of

Men, for the purpo&s;e of intitling them to the &s;pecial Mercy of God. It &s;eems, taking their Words in &s;uch a Reference, they both with equal Expre&s;&s;ions of a ju&s;t Contempt and generous Di&s;|dain explode <HI>their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as altogether inadequate and unavailable to &s;o great a De&s;ign: the one re&s;embling it to <HI>filthy Rags,</HI> and the other to loath&s;ome <HI>Dung.</HI> (I &s;tay not to critici&s;e on the Tran&s;lation, nor mention the Variety of &s;uppos'd Allu&s;i|ons in the Original.) <HI>Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in all it's Forms and Appearances &s;tands condemn'd and vilify'd here. Even the Saints mo&s;t perfect <HI>Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> as re&s;pected under certain re&s;trictive Con&s;iderations, are all thus depreciated by the in&s;pir'd Prophet and Apo&s;tle, yea, have a deep Di&s;grace thrown upon them by the&s;e homely and contemptuous Simile's.&mdash; We have exem|plify'd here the agreeing humble Confe&s;&s;ions both of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church and <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and the Harmony of the Saints of every Age in <HI>acknowledging the Truth which is after Godline&s;s.</HI>&mdash; This is the View I have of the&s;e Scriptures, after diligent and impartial Inquiry into their true Meaning: and in this, I think, I have the concurrent Suffrage of the Body of reform'd Churches and Di|vines.&mdash; However, let us now recollect the varying Glo&s;&s;es of Commentators and Preachers upon the&s;e Words, and a little exa|mine into their &s;everal Grounds and Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">I. I ob&s;erve, &s;ome interpret both the <HI>Prophet</HI> and the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> as &s;peaking only of a <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> or meer <HI>external Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> and according to them, 'tis at mo&s;t but a <HI>Form of Godline&s;s</HI> with|out the Power, or &s;ome Shew of moral Virtue without the Reality, that is here repre&s;ented in &s;uch Terms of Reproach.&mdash; Yet, as there are different Degrees of <HI>Phari&s;ai&s;m,</HI> and Hypocri&s;y appears in a Variety of Figures, the&s;e Interpreters, th&ocirc; agreeing in the general Sentiment, are divided about the particular Application of it, and go into a various Latitude of Thought.</P>
<P N="1">1. There are tho&s;e who &s;o re&s;train the Meaning of the&s;e Scrip|tures, as to &s;uppo&s;e them applicable only to the Ca&s;e of <HI>gro&s;&s;er Hypocrites:</HI> who&s;e feigned <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> they willingly grant, de&s;erves no better Name than that of <HI>Dung,</HI> or <HI>filthy Rags.</HI>&mdash; They own, the Scriptures every where paint the con&s;cious and de&s;igning Hypocrite in Characters of Ignominy; and pronounce the <HI>Sacrifices of the Wicked,</HI> th&ocirc; pretending to be <HI>Sacrifices of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> an <HI>Abomination to the Lord.</HI> To this Purpo&s;e they apply tho&s;e Divine Pa&s;&s;ages,&mdash; <HI>Bring no more vain Oblations;&mdash;I hate, I de&s;pi&s;e your Fea&s;t-Days;&mdash; Is it &s;uch a Fa&s;t that I have cho&s;en? &mdash;I will declare thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and thy Works; for they &s;hall not

This is what &s;ome contend to be the whole Amount (particularly) of the <HI>Prophet's</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion in our Text; as if he only had in his Eye the <HI>Righ|teou&s;ne&s;&s;es</HI> (fal&s;ely &s;o called) of the vile&s;t Hypocrites, who <HI>feign them&s;elves to be ju&s;t Men,</HI> while yet in Truth (and for that Rea|&s;on) they are to be rank'd among the very wor&s;t of <HI>wicked</HI> Men.</P>
<P>In this very confin'd Sen&s;e, the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in particular under&s;tands the <HI>Prophet's</HI> Words, rejecting the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Sen&s;e with deep Indignation; and that, as they think, upon &s;ufficient Grounds in Scripture and Rea&s;on, the mo&s;t plau&s;ible of which I will now produce and endeavour to refute. Thus Dr. BISHOP a <HI>popi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t (in his An&s;wer to Mr. PERKYNS'S <HI>Reform'd Catholick</HI>) &s;hews his Opinion, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. ABBOT'S De&s;. of Reform.

<HI>old Prote&s;tants</HI> for an infallible Standard of Orthodoxy; yet, with|out more convincing Rea&s;ons than any their Opponents have ever offer'd, I &s;hould be loth &s;o much as to &s;eem to betray their Cau&s;e or to reflect on their Memory, by giving up &s;o notable a Text, which <HI>they triumph'd in &amp; always had in their Mouths,</HI> into the Hands of their <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Adver&s;aries. However, it may not be ami&s;s, to hear the Grounds of the PAPIST'S judging this Text impertinently alledg'd, and what the <HI>Reformers</HI> &s;ay in their own Defence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Champion a&s;&s;igns <Q><HI>three</HI> Rea&s;ons, (1.) Becau&s;e undoubtedly <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> do's not &s;peak of righteous Men, but <HI>(de in&s;ignibus Peccatoribus)</HI> of remarkably <HI>wicked</HI> Men.</Q>&mdash; To invalidate which, the PROTESTANT replies; Certainly this Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> was no &s;uch <HI>wicked</HI> Man, and he includes <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> together with other pious Per&s;ons in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when in the Name of the Church he pre&s;ents this humble Confe&s;&s;ion to God, <HI>All</HI> OUR <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are as filthy Rags.</HI> Nor is there any Thing here confe&s;s'd, more than is imply'd in this &s;ame Prophet's humble Words on a former Occa&s;ion, (Chap. 6.) <HI>I am a Man of unclean Lips, and dwell in the mid&s;t of a People of unclean Lips.</HI> And the PROTESTANT further argues, they can't be profligate Sinners, who are per&s;onated by the Prophet in this Confe&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e none &s;uch can truly (in the Sen&s;e intended) plead as in the Context, <HI>Doubtle&s;s thou art our Father;&mdash;Thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer,&mdash; Return for thy Servants &s;ake&mdash; We are thine&mdash;We &s;hall he &s;aved&mdash;Now, O Lord, thou art our Father&mdash; We are the Work of thy Hand,</HI> &amp;c. Neverthele&s;s the PAPIST attempts by &s;everal Con&s;iderations, to &s;upport and &s;trengthen this his fir&s;t Rea&s;on why the Prophet &s;hould be thought to &s;peak in the Per&s;on of very <HI>wicked</HI> Men. As, "(1.) Becau&s;e in the pre|ceeding Context he had &s;aid, <HI>Behold thou art wroth, and we have &s;inned.</HI>" But the PROTESTANT &s;ees no Force of Argument in this. For no Man liveth and <HI>&s;inneth not;</HI> and God is <HI>angry</HI> at Sin, wherever he &s;eeth it: He keeps his own Children under a holy Di&s;cipline, while in this World, and often cha&s;ti&s;es the Righ|teous for their &s;inful Failings, with a fatherly Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The PAPIST adds, <Q>(2.) It is plain that the Prophet &s;peaks in the Per&s;on of the <HI>Wicked,</HI> from tho&s;e Words in the following Con|text, <HI>There is none that calleth upon thy Name, There is none that ri&s;eth up and taketh Hold on Thee.</HI></Q> But the PROTESTANT reply's, The Righteous are liable to a &s;ad Decay of Faith and Prayer; and indeed in the Prayers of the Saints, at be&s;t, there's always too little of Love and Zeal to the <HI>Name of the Lord,</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="006500_0008_1029141D6BD373B0">
too little of a <HI>&s;tirring up them&s;elves to take hold on God:</HI> So that in the Account of God's Law and &s;trict rectoral Holine&s;s, their Prayers are as it were <HI>no</HI> Prayers, and at lea&s;t very frequently are &s;uch as &s;carce de&s;erve the Name even in the Account of Go&s;pel-Grace: Yea, for a Sea&s;on there may be &s;o much of Formality and Deadne&s;s in their praying, as that God interprets it a <HI>not calling on his Name,</HI> a <HI>not taking Hold of him;</HI> and when Con&s;cience is awaken'd in his back&s;liding Children, they charge them&s;elves with vile Deficiency in the Duties of Faith and Prayer, they cen&s;ure and humble them&s;elves for the <HI>Iniquity of their holy Things,</HI> as the Root of all their Defection, and a ju&s;t Rea&s;on of their hea|venly Father's correcting them.&mdash; The PAPIST &s;ubjoins,</P>
<P N="3"><Q>(3) The Scripture every where &s;peaks <HI>honorably</HI> of the Works of <HI>righteous</HI> Men, and a&s;&s;erts their being <HI>well plea&s;ing</HI> to God, as a <HI>&s;weet &s;melling</HI> Savour: and in this very Chapter <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Thou meete&s;t him that rejoyceth and worketh Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Hence (the <HI>Je&s;uite</HI> concludes) <Q>none can &s;uppo&s;e him to call the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es</HI> of Saints <HI>filthy Rags;</HI> unle&s;s any one be &s;o <HI>doating</HI> as to imagine that <HI>na&s;ty</HI> Things are plea&s;ing to God, and that <HI>filthy Rags</HI> are a &s;weet Odour to him who is the Fountain of <HI>Purity.</HI></Q> But to this the PROTESTANT reply's, that the Saints Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s are not con&s;ider'd <HI>ab&s;o|lutely,</HI> when honour'd with the&s;e Eulogies, nor are accepted for their own intrin&s;ick Dignity, Purity and Perfection: But they have their E&s;timate, in the Court of governing Grace, from the plea|&s;ing Principle of <HI>Faith,</HI> which is the &s;pring of them, and are valu'd for the &s;ake of the plea&s;ing <HI>Mediator,</HI> in who&s;e <HI>Name</HI> they are perform'd, with who&s;e <HI>Blood</HI> they are &s;prinkled and clean&s;ed, and with the &s;weet Incen&s;e of who&s;e <HI>Merits</HI> they are perfum'd. Whereas, &s;trictly in them&s;elves con&s;ider'd and view'd in the Gla&s;s of the Law, they are full of Imperfection and moral Pol|lution; in&s;omuch that they can't be call'd <HI>good</HI> Works, but in very <HI>lax</HI> Language, and in a <HI>comparative</HI> Sen&s;e.

Hence that Speech of BASIL, a primitive Father, <Q><HI>This</HI> is our whole &amp; full <HI>rejoycing in God,</HI> while we confe&s;s our &s;elves <HI>de&s;titute of all Righteou&s;ne&s;s of our own,</HI> that we are <HI>ju&s;tified by only Faith in Chri&s;t.</HI></Q> And that &s;aying of JEROM, another of the Fathers, <Q>In <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> our Lord, in whom we have Boldne&s;s, and Acce&s;s (to God) and Confi|dence thro' the <HI>Faith</HI> of him: <HI>not thro' our Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> but <HI>thro' Him</HI> in who&s;e Name our Sins be forgiven.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cited by Bp JEWEL, <HI>ubi &s;upra.</HI></NOTE> So then, altho' the Prophet had ju&s;t before &s;aid in his Prayer, <HI>Thou meete&s;t him that rejoyceth and worketh Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> this carries in it no|thing at all of real Incon&s;i&s;tency with the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Glo&s;s on his following Confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>All our Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are as filthy Rags:</HI> Nor does it afford <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> the lea&s;t Shadow of an Argument in favour of their Hypothe&s;is, that the Prophet makes this humble Confe&s;&s;ion in the Per&s;on of the <HI>Wicked.</HI> Indeed, the <HI>rejoycing</HI> &s;poken of, is a <HI>rejoycing in</HI> GOD our Saviour, &s;aying (as in Context) <HI>Thou art our Redeemer:</HI> Or a <HI>glorying in the Lord,</HI> after that Man|ner in which this Prophet de&s;cribes it (Chap. 45.17.) <HI>Surely &s;hall one &s;ay, In the Lord have I Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Strength.</HI> 'Tis

the Language of <HI>Faith:</HI> and this is an operative obedientia Prin|ciple. <HI>Faith worketh by Love;</HI> and by <HI>Faith,</HI> the Saints of every Age have <HI>wrought Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Yet 'tis equally a Principle of <HI>Humility,</HI> laying the Saint low in his own Eyes, and teaching him to entertain low Tho'ts of his own <HI>Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But let the POPISH Di&s;putant go on. <Q>Nor ought it to move us (&s;ays he) tho' <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;eems to &s;peak to <HI>generally,</HI> as to com|prehend <HI>all</HI> Men: becau&s;e this is the Manner of Scripture, to &s;peak of <HI>many,</HI> as if it were <HI>all.</HI></Q>&mdash; However, to this the PROTESTANT has an ea&s;y Reply to make. Neither the Ana|logy of Faith, nor any Thing in the Context, obliges us to con&s;true the Term of <HI>Univer&s;ality</HI> here in a limited Sen&s;e, as extending only to the <HI>Wicked,</HI> in Exclu&s;ion of the Righteous. But on the contrary, as there are very apparent Grounds in the Context, to &s;uppo&s;e the Prophet's making this Prayer in the Per&s;on of the <HI>Righteous,</HI> and con&s;equently <HI>their</HI> making the Confe&s;&s;ion, in Di&s;|pute; &s;o our Imputation of it to them is ju&s;tifiable, by the Scrip|ture-Repre&s;entations of the Saints pre&s;ent State of moral Imper|fection, and by a Variety of parallel Examples both in the Old and New Te&s;tament. For we often find the Righteous lamenting the Defects and Defilements of their <HI>Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as well as deploring the Interruption of their Obedience by <HI>Works of Wickedne&s;s:</HI> and accordingly crying to God for pardoning and &s;paring Mercy, with earne&s;t Deprecations of a judicial proceed|ing again&s;t them. I might in&s;tance in <HI>Job,</HI> that perfect and upright Man, and refer you to many Pa&s;&s;ages of his, to this purpo&s;e. So in <HI>David,</HI> the Man after God's own Heart, who abounds with Expre&s;&s;ions, of this Import, in his P&s;alms. And in <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> in <HI>Paul,</HI> with many other Saints on Scripture-Re|cord. But the Time would fail me. There are a Multitude of the Saints Confe&s;&s;ions, who&s;e Language implies nothing &s;hort of this in the Text, <HI>All our Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are as filthy Rags.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed, &s;ays the PAPIST, <Q>Another Rea&s;on is, be|cau&s;e tho' <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;hould &s;peak of <HI>all,</HI> i. e. of that whole People, yet he did not &s;peak of all for <HI>every</HI> Time, but <HI>only</HI> for <HI>that</HI> Time when for their con&s;ummate <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> they were doom'd to Captivity in <HI>Babylon.</HI></Q>&mdash; To which the PROTESTANT an&s;wers: This Prayer of in&s;pir'd <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> is indeed prophetical, and re&s;pects a future Time, perhaps in particular that of the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Captivity, or as &s;ome think, the Times of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> But &s;till it contains many Things of a <HI>common</HI> Reference, or <HI>gene|ral</HI> A&s;pect; and the Confe&s;&s;ion in our Text is accommodable to <HI>all</HI> Times of the Church indifferently. For it is founded on
<PB N="9" REF="006500_0011_102913D56DE0BC58">
a melancholy Truth, equally applicable to every Age, as to that in which <HI>Solomon</HI> lived, <HI>There is not a ju&s;t Man upon Earth, who doeth Good, and &s;inneth not,</HI> even in his <HI>good</HI> Deeds them&s;elves, as to the Manner of doing them.

<P>The PAPIST adds, <Q>A third Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> do's not &s;peak of <HI>all the Works</HI> even of the Wicked, but only of tho&s;e which they imagined to be <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es;</HI> &s;uch as their <HI>Sacrifices, New-Moons,</HI> and <HI>Rituals</HI> of Wor&s;hip, wherein they e&s;pecially placed <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> which Ob&s;ervances indeed, for want of being done with a right Intention and in due Manner, are de&s;ervedly compar'd to <HI>filthy Rags.</HI></Q>&mdash; But to this the PROTESTANT replies; that there is no Colour for &s;uch a Limitation; for the Prophet &s;peaks in <HI>indefinite</HI> Language, his Con|fe&s;&s;ion is of <HI>univer&s;al</HI> Extent, without any Exception or Re&s;erve, ALL <HI>our Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are as filthy Rags.</HI> Agreably I find that Note made upon the&s;e Words by Bp JEWEL, an eminent old Reformer: <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ser. at the End of his Works, Pag. 215.</NOTE> <Q>Our <HI>Virtue,</HI> our <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> our Fa&s;tings, our Prayers, are <HI>filthy,</HI> when they come to GOD'S Sight.</Q> And it's the famous Dr. WILLET'S Ob&s;ervation on the Text: <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Synop.

Thus, in explaining that <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law</HI> which the Scriptures &s;hut out of <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> he produces &s;everal Texts, where he tells us, "<HI>Works</HI> are excluded <HI>&s;imply,</HI> without any Mention of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law." And, however in|con&s;i&s;tently with his Argument before us, he expre&s;ly makes the following remarkable Conce&s;&s;ion. <Q>The Apo&s;tle having to do (&s;ays he) not only with Jews, but al&s;o with <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that boa&s;ted of their <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> no le&s;s than the Jews did of their Law, We [of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>] therefore under&s;tand him <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> to exclude <HI>all Works,</HI> antecedent to <HI>Faith,</HI> as well the Ob&s;ervation of <HI>Morals,</HI> as of Ceremonies.</Q>&mdash; By the <HI>Cardinal's</HI> Leave then, interpreting the <HI>Prophet</HI>'s Confe&s;&s;ion by the Apo&s;tle's allow'd Doctrine, we may fairly extend the Com|pari&s;on of <HI>filthy Rags</HI> to <HI>all Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es,</HI> of a <HI>moral</HI> Complexion, as well as ritual. And it follows too, by the &s;ame Rule of judg|ing, that &s;ince he grants <HI>all Works</HI> indifferently (previous to <HI>Faith</HI>) are rejected, he ought not to have confin'd the <HI>Prophet</HI>'s Idea in the Text to the Works of very <HI>wicked</HI> Men, or gro&s;s Hypo|crites, that did but practi&s;e a little Religion meerly <HI>in Pretence,</HI> in wilful Di&s;gui&s;e and with con&s;cious Di&s;&s;imulation; <HI>all</HI> Hypocrites and Sinners in <HI>Zion</HI> not being of &s;o abandon'd a Character.</P>
<P>Nor &s;urely may this be allow'd to have been the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s View and Meaning in <HI>his</HI> part of our Text. For it can't with the lea&s;t Colour of Rea&s;on be pretended, that <HI>he</HI> is per&s;onating the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of <HI>wicked</HI> Men; &s;ince he is here in the directe&s;t Language &s;peaking of <HI>him&s;elf</HI> &s;ingly: and he never confe&s;s'd him&s;elf &s;uch a foul Di&s;&s;embler with God or Man, as the vicious and de&s;igning Hypocrite; no, but on the contrary, we find him almo&s;t on all Occa&s;ions vindicating his moral Character from &s;o black a Slur, and even in our Context claiming to have been always an un&s;pot|ted Example of human Sincerity in his <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice: neverthele&s;s even this hone&s;t moral <HI>Jew</HI> here reports of him&s;elf, that when commencing a <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> Convert, he counted all his <HI>Phari&s;aical Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> tho' &s;o untainted, &s;o exemplary

and re&s;pectable, but as <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> and <HI>Dung,</HI> for Chri&s;t's Sake. Now doubtle&s;s, as there were &s;ome other <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> in his Day alike <HI>undi&s;&s;embling</HI> as he, to all who&s;e <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es</HI> the &s;ame Charac|ters of Di&s;grace were equally due: &s;o there might be &s;everal like In&s;tances of <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> Morality, in the Jewi&s;h Church, at the Time <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> refers to in his prophetical Prayer, which contains this humble Confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>All our Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are as filthy Rags:</HI> a Confe&s;&s;ion &s;urely no le&s;s &s;uitable for the mo&s;t <HI>moral</HI> Hypocrite among them, than was that of <HI>Saul</HI> the Phari&s;ee, for him&s;elf.

<P N="2">2.

<P>As to the <HI>Prophet</HI>'s Confe&s;&s;ion, 'tis commonly judg'd by PRO|TESTANT Writers, that he is here prophetically addre&s;&s;ing the Throne of Grace in the <HI>Church</HI>'s Name, at &s;ome Sea&s;on of &s;pe|cial Awakning and Reformation. And if they be con&s;ider'd as now reflecting on their former Doings in Religion, previous to their Conver&s;ion, it is acknowledg'd, the Language of their Con|fe&s;&s;ion here is but what became <HI>&s;elf-judging</HI> Penitents, and in|deed is u&s;ual with &s;uch.

<P>Certainly our <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> in <HI>his</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion before us, mu&s;t be own'd an Example of this &s;elf-condemning and &s;elf-abhorring Frame of Mind; if we only con&s;ider him as therein re&s;pecting his former unregenerate Life.

He now &s;ees and confe&s;&s;es, that notwith&s;tanding the laudable Con&s;i&s;tence of his vi&s;ible Actions and the uniform Tenor of his Behaviour in the World, under the Influences of natural Con&s;ci|ence, excited and improv'd by a religious Education, his pa&s;t Life had been polluted with Abundance of moral Evils, th&ocirc; of a more refin'd Sort; and that his very be&s;t Duties (whether of the ceremonial, or moral Kind) had all been vitiated by <HI>Unbelief</HI> and <HI>&s;ecret Hypocri&s;y,</HI> wretchedly defective and corrupt therefore in a ju&s;t <HI>Theological</HI> View, and now appearing to his inlighten'd Eyes worthy the Name of <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> and <HI>Dung</HI> it &s;elf.

<P>Indeed, there are Interpreters, that from &s;uch a View as they've taken of the preceeding Context, do &s;uppo&s;e him in our Text but to renounce <HI>Judai&s;m,</HI> as &s;uch; to di&s;claim that <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>

Indeed I can't find by any Hint in their Writings, that the&s;e <HI>old Prote&s;tants</HI> allow'd a Place, in this Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> for the Di&s;tinction &s;ome of late have &s;o warmly e&s;pous'd, between a <HI>Law-Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and a <HI>Go&s;pel-Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of the moral Kind. Be&s;ure&punc; &s;ince a perfect immaculate Obedience to the <HI>Law,</HI> in its Rigour, is impracticable in this fallen State of Mankind, they &s;aw no Colour for any Hope of Ju&s;tification by a (&s;trictly) <HI>Legal</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>our own:</HI> which, if it be not more than the very <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> pretend to, yet perhaps is all that &s;ome modern <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> in orthodox Language, appear to renounce.

And in Con&s;equence of this, they concluded the <HI>Defects</HI> in the Saints Obedience to have the Nature of <HI>Sin;</HI> not only as being again&s;t the original <HI>Law</HI> of Morality, but again&s;t the Injunctions of the very <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> it&s;elf; and being thus &s;inful, therefore needing Divine <HI>Forgivene&s;s.</HI> In which State of the Ca&s;e, they &s;aw <HI>their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> in every View of it, ab&s;olutely in&s;ufficient, by any Worth or Excellency in it &s;elf, to <HI>ingratiate</HI> them with an infinitely holy and omni&s;cient Lawgiver; and altogether unfit to be con&s;ider'd as a <HI>ju&s;tifying</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s before God, even in the compa&s;&s;ionate and gracious Plan of the Go&s;pel.&mdash; But <HI>the exceeding Riches of the Grace of God in his Kindne&s;s towards us by Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the very Mercy of Mercies in the infinitely merci|ful Scheme of Man's Salvation, the&s;e <HI>old Prote&s;tants</HI> &s;aw, lay in the Provi&s;ion of a better <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> than their own <HI>inherent,</HI> to an&s;wer the End of <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> and Intitlement to God's &s;pe|cial Favour, that is, the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of CHRIST, <HI>imputed</HI> to Believers, and <HI>covering their Sins</HI> from the Eye of vindictive Ju&s;tice.

'What can <HI>all our Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> be (&s;aith he) in the Sight of GOD?

<P>This Reply of Dr. ABBOT is &s;ufficient, I think, to vindicate the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Interpretation of the Prophet's Words again&s;t the Charge of Novelty, as well as Perver&s;ion and Abu&s;e.&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ad huju&s;modi Dicta explicanda, Interprete benigno Opus e&s;t, non maligno Calumniatore.&mdash; <HI>Epi&s;c.

<P><PB N="34" REF="006500_0036_1029144D2462A6C8">But now in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Place,</P>
<P>It remains, to &s;ay &s;omething on the other Part of my Text, the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s Words, in the &s;ame View &amp; Application wherein we have la&s;t been con&s;idering the Words of the Prophet, as referring to the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of <HI>real Saints.</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle is in the Text and Context giving a Rea&s;on of the Hope that is in him, exhibiting the Ground of his pre&s;ent Confidence towards God, and declaring the Foundation on which he de&s;ired to be finally &s;tanding, when he &s;hould appear before the <HI>Judge of all.</HI> For tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>That I may win Chri&s;t and be found in him,</HI> Expo&s;itors in general &s;uppo&s;e, have a tacit Relation to the <HI>Judgment</HI> of GOD.&mdash; And they are agreed, I think, that the Apo&s;tle declares, not only that he formerly had renounced his Phari&s;aical <HI>Gains,</HI> as <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> for CHRIST, but that he now undervalues <HI>all Things</HI> (whether worldly Advantages, Church-Privileges, or per&s;onal Accompli&s;hments, even all that's valu'd among Men) in <HI>Compari&s;on</HI> with CHRIST, and renounces <HI>every Thing</HI> what&s;oever in <HI>Competition</HI> with Him: yea, that he now counts them but <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> and <HI>Dung,</HI> comparatively to CHRIST, who was precious to him above all, whom he would &s;uffer nothing to rival, and whom he &s;uperlatively de&s;ires to <HI>win,</HI> to gain the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, and to be <HI>found in him,</HI> at la&s;t, <HI>not having his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But the Di&s;pute is, What <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> the Apo&s;tle here in|tends; and in what Re&s;pect he &s;o undervalues this, counting it even as <HI>Dung.</HI>&mdash; Now the commonly receiv'd Opinion among PROTESTANTS has been, that the Apo&s;tle includes in his Idea <HI>all</HI> his own per&s;onal <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> of whatever Kind, Degree, or Date of Attainment: and as to the Notion under which he &s;o depreciates <HI>his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> that it is not as con&s;ider'd &s;imply and ab&s;olutely, but only <HI>comparatively</HI> to the more excellent <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of CHRIST, and relatively to the impor|tant Concern of being <HI>found of his Judge in Peace.</HI></P>
<P>The PAPISTS indeed are of Opinion, that the Apo&s;tle in our Text renounces <HI>nothing more</HI> than what he had in the preceeding Context already expre&s;s'd his Renunciation of, that is, his old <HI>Phari&s;aical Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> <Q>that <HI>external</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s which he had while continuing in the <HI>Jews</HI> Religion:</Q> and &s;o they think, his Example can only teach us to renounce a meerly <Q><HI>external</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s, of Works without Faith, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Proud</HI> and <HI>Self-confident;</HI> a Righteou&s;ne&s;s which cannot plea&s;e God, and which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> holds <HI>Contempt.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">BELLARM. <HI>de Ju&s;tif.</HI> p. 90. 96. 412.</NOTE></P>

<P>The PAPIST <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">BELLARM. <HI>de Ju&s;tif.</HI> p. 90 96, &amp; p. 176, 177.</NOTE> indeed thinks per&s;onal <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> to be intended by the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith;</HI> which he &s;uppo&s;es to mean, not any extrin&s;ick, relative, imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>another,</HI> but an intrin&s;ick, qualitative, and moral Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>our own;</HI> call'd the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Faith</HI> is the vital Root or Principle, from whence our &s;incere Obedience &s;prings: and this he imagines to be call'd <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> GOD, becau&s;e God is the prime Efficient of it, becau&s;e 'tis an Image of his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and becau&s;e he accepts it for our Ju&s;tification &mdash; But PROTESTANTS an&s;wer to this, that the Manner of Expre&s;&s;i|on u&s;ed by the Apo&s;tle here, nece&s;&s;arily carry's it to a different Sen&s;e. He do's not &s;ay, <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which</HI> IS <HI>Faith,</HI> or which is the <HI>Obedience of Faith;</HI> but <HI>that which is</HI> THROUGH <HI>Faith of Chri&s;t, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God</HI> BY <HI>Faith.</HI> Phra&s;es never made U&s;e of by this Apo&s;tle in his Writings, nor any where el&s;e in Scripture, to de&s;cribe <HI>our own</HI> inherent <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s;</HI> as if <HI>Faith</HI> it&s;elf, or the Fruits of Faith produced in us, were the very <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> that is the Matter or objective Rea&s;on of our <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> before God: but always to point out the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of CHRIST (not his ab&s;olute, but his re&s;pective, di&s;pen&s;ative Righteou&s;ne&s;s) as the Object which <HI>Faith</HI> eyes and receives, and centres its Expectations in, for obtaining Mercy. The Scriptures frequently mention the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God,</HI> the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is thro' Faith,</HI> but ever with a plain Reference to a Righteou&s;ne&s;s foreign or extrin&s;ecal to us; the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>another,</HI> and not that which is in our &s;elves;

<P>It has been further remark'd by <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Writers, that there's a beautiful <HI>Gradation</HI> in the Apo&s;tle's Speech, of which our Text is a Part; that it is evidently <HI>progre&s;&s;ive,</HI> not in the <HI>Ten&s;es</HI> only, but the <HI>Contents</HI> of it.

<P>No, &s;ays the PROTESTANT, not by any Means. This is no ju&s;t Con&s;equence from our Doctrine: there's no Appearance of Rea&s;on for &s;uch an Inference. What we plead for, is their being excluded from all Concernment in <HI>Ju&s;tification of Life:</HI> with re|gard to <HI>this</HI> indeed let 'em be put away out of Sight, and treated with Neglect, in point of Dependance or plea&s;ing Reflection upon them; nay, let 'em be even contemned, as worthle&s;s <HI>Dung,</HI> in Compari&s;on with the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, the only recon|ciling and ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s. In re&s;pect of this, the Apo&s;tle de&s;pis'd and repudiated every Thing of his own; All went, that he might <HI>win Chri&s;t, and be found in Him, not having for his Righteou&s;ne&s;s that which is of Law:</HI> for he knew, there was no <HI>Law</HI> in Being, who&s;e <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> could ju&s;tify a morally im|perfect Creature. Indeed the <HI>Law</HI> Man was originally placed under, had a Reference and Aptitude to the De&s;ign of <HI>Ju&s;tification:</HI> but then it was the Ju&s;tification of a <HI>righteous</HI> and <HI>innocent,</HI> not an apo&s;tate &s;inful Man; &s;o that upon the Lo&s;s of his Innocence, there was a Change of his Ca&s;e, in point of Capacity to reach Ju&s;tification by the <HI>Deeds of the Law.</HI> And whatever Degree of moral <HI>Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> habitual or actual, any may recover by the Grace of God, yet it being ever defective, while in this World, and unequal to the Demands of the Law moral, it is con&s;equently unequal to the De&s;ign of <HI>ju&s;tifying</HI> him in the Eye of the Law. Only the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is adequate to the Law-Demand, and &s;atisfactory to Divine Ju&s;tice: therefore only this, imputed and received by Faith, is &s;ufficient to <HI>ju&s;tify the Ungodly.</HI> In point of <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> then good Works are by no Means to be the Object of our Confidence; but the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST alone is to engro&s;s our whole Tru&s;t and Regard: Yet this do's not in the lea&s;t argue, that good Works mu&s;t be of no Account at all with us, in point of <HI>Sanctification.</HI> Tho' contemptible in one View, mayn't they be re&s;pectable in another? Tho' not at all influential to effect one De&s;ign, mayn't they be &s;ub&s;ervient to another End?

Otherwi&s;e, for various excellent Purpo&s;es, he was bent upon di|ligently following every <HI>good Work,</HI> endeavouring that he might <HI>perfect Holine&s;s</HI> in the Fear of God, and &s;eeking after a <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s according to Law,</HI> as fully conformable to the moral Rule as po&s;&s;ible in this imperfect State; and he long'd for Heaven with a View as much to the perfect Purity, as the perfect Re&s;t and Happine&s;s of that better Country. And this is the Principle, this the Spirit of the real <HI>Prote&s;tant.</HI> He loves the <HI>Law</HI> of God, and is alive to it as the Rule of moral Duty; while yet as a <HI>Co|venant</HI> of Works, he is dead to it. And while making the Obedience <HI>of Chri&s;t</HI> his Tru&s;t, he al&s;o con&s;iders it as an Example for his Imitation, and de&s;ires to have the Image, as well as the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t upon him: nor can content him&s;elf with an idle Profe&s;&s;ion of ju&s;tifying Faith, but &s;tudies to <HI>&s;hew his Faith by his Works;</HI> and the more <HI>&s;trong in Faith,</HI> the more <HI>zealous of good Works;</HI> the more CHRIST is <HI>precious to them that believe,</HI> the more hateful will Sin appear, and Holine&s;s the more amiable in their Eyes; which Views will by a natural Efficacy put them upon &s;hunning the one and following the other. Hence that Ob&s;ervation of the judicious Mr. WILLARD <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pref. to Dr. MATHER'S <HI>Everl. Go&s;p.</HI></NOTE> <Q>I am &s;atisfy'd,

<P>Upon the Whole, what little Ground then had the CARDINAL, who&s;e Rea&s;onings we've been examining, to conclude them with that in&s;ulting Reflection; "Let [the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI>] now go his Way and complain that we call him an <HI>Enemy to good Works!</HI>"</P>
<P>No, &s;ays the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> in Return, we dete&s;t the vile Character; and con&s;cious of Innocence, we confront our injurious Accu&s;ers. We claim to be the true&s;t <HI>Friends,</HI> and not at all Enemies to good Works, whether in point of Doctrine, or Di&s;po&s;ition, Principle or Fact. Religiou&s;ly we teach the Nece&s;&s;ity, the Excellency, and the U&s;efulne&s;s of good Works; nor hold any Opinion, but what in its true Con&s;truction is friendly, not inimical to them. Indeed we renounce the undue Honours which our Adver&s;aries claim for them, and are careful to have the Re&s;pects paid 'em duly regu|lated, conformably to the Scripture-Rule: Accordingly we con&s;ider good Works as the Fruit or Con&s;equent of <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> and don't &s;et them up as the Cau&s;e, the Rea&s;on or antecedent Condition of it; we don't exalt 'em to a Rival&s;hip with CHRIST'S <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> we don't &s;et them in Competition with <HI>Faith:</HI> but &s;till we value them in their proper Place and Order, &amp; with Reference to their genuine Ends. We think it our bounden Duty, and an Ingredient of our Happine&s;s, as well as becoming our Go&s;pel-Profe&s;&s;ion, to be the genuine Lovers and Practi&s;ers of good Works. We recommend the Love and Practice of them to others. In Conformity to Scripture-Doctrine, we inculcate upon them that <HI>have believed,</HI> a Care to exhibit and evidence their <HI>Faith,</HI> by a <HI>good Conver&s;ation in Chri&s;t.</HI> Nor dare we flatter any in their Preten&s;ion to <HI>ju&s;tifying Faith,</HI> while we &s;ee it contradicted by their habitual Neglect of holy Behaviour: for according to our Doctrine, the <HI>Faith</HI> which receives CHRIST for <HI>Ju&s;tifi|cation,</HI> do's al&s;o receive him for <HI>Sanctification;</HI> &amp; not only apply's his <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> to cover our Sins, but his <HI>Strength</HI> to excite and enable us to <HI>work Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> our &s;elves, to mortify our Lu&s;ts, to clean&s;e our Hands, and purify our Hearts, that we may glorify <HI>God</HI> in this World, and be prepared to enjoy Him in a better. How then can we ju&s;tly be characteriz'd <HI>Enemies to good Works!</HI> Nay, but in Truth the foul Character belongs to tho&s;e who are <HI>Enemies of the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t</HI> and to <HI>Faith in his Blood;</HI> the one being the procuring Cau&s;e, and the other the producing Principle of good Works.&mdash; We clo&s;e with the Words of Bp HALL <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His WORKS, p. 316, 677. and his <HI>Old Religion,</HI> p. 40.</NOTE>

<P>The APPLICATION of what has been &s;aid now remains. The Weight and U&s;efulne&s;s of the Subject would invite us to dwell &s;till longer on it, by way of Reflection and Inference, in a Variety of Particulars, that might profitably be enlarg'd upon. But I mu&s;t only &s;ugge&s;t the following Hints; which may the ra|ther &s;uffice, as I've endeavour'd to throw a practical Light on the Argument all along thro' the Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> No Wonder then, that Mini&s;ters of more mature Judg|ment and Experience in Religion, have commonly laid out &s;o much of their Labours in the Word upon that great Evangelical Subject, the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> CHRIST, made ours by the Donation of God and the Application of <HI>Faith;</HI> and when on any <HI>moral</HI> Subject, that they have &s;tudy'd di&s;creetly to a&s;&s;ign it's due Place in Chri&s;tian Divinity, and to point out the true Principles of ac|ceptable Obedience, refer it to it's genuine Ends, and inculcate a humble Dependance on CHRIST both for <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> while they urged the Pur&s;uit of per&s;onal Holine&s;s. &mdash; It has ri&s;en from a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own Imperfection and In&s;ufficiency, from a dutiful Regard for the Honour of the Re|deemer, and a tender Care for the Salvation of Souls.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> How &s;olicitous &s;hould all Mini&s;ters (pretending to the Character of <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI>) be, that in preaching on <HI>moral</HI> Themes they well regulate, methodize and guard their Di&s;cour&s;es, le&s;t any

Hearer &s;hould thro' their Heterodoxy or Carele&s;ne&s;s <HI>get a Snare to his Soul?</HI> Here, omitting all that my own Tho'ts might &s;ug|ge&s;t, I &s;hall only a&s;k your Attention to what that venerable Fa|ther in our I&s;rael, the late Mr. WILLARD, &s;ays in his judicious and faithful Sermon, intitled, <HI>Morality not to be rely'd on for Life;</HI> where having among other Things ob&s;erv'd, touching <Q>the Influence <HI>Faith</HI> has into our moral Obedience, That it makes us apprehen&s;ive we can be <HI>accepted</HI> only <HI>in the</HI> BELOVED, That it makes us confe&s;s with the <HI>Church</HI> (I&s;a. 64.6.) <HI>All our Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are as filthy Rags,</HI> and to profe&s;s with <HI>Paul</HI> (Phil 3.8.) <HI>I count all Things but Lo&s;s and Dung that I may win Chri&s;t;</HI></Q> He begins the Application of his excellent Di&s;cour&s;e with this Inference, which I &s;hall repeat intire as wor|thy of our &s;olemn Con&s;ideration, and what may be, if I mi&s;take not, a Word in Sea&s;on. <Q><HI>Hence</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>what Caution had Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters need to u&s;e in their preaching up of</HI> moral <HI>Du|ties?</HI> That it is their Duty to preach them and pre&s;s them upon their Hearers, is certain; otherwi&s;e they cannot be faithful in <HI>declaring the whole Coun&s;el of God:</HI> And yet, if they &s;o preach them as to <HI>revive the Covenant of Works,</HI> to <HI>advance the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Man,</HI> and <HI>depreciate the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> CHRIST, they are far from being the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, and are indeed the Betrayers of Souls, as far as in them lieth. Nor indeed (&s;ays he) do I know of any Thing which doth more threaten the Undermining of true Chri&s;tianity and the bringing in of <HI>another Go&s;pel,</HI> than the putting of <HI>moral Vir|tues</HI> into a Legal Dre&s;s, and without any more Ado to com|mend them to us as the <HI>Graces</HI> of our Chri&s;tian Religion. He who when he hath told Men all the moral Duties required in the Law of God, and laid them out according to their Nature, as they were enjoined on them in the <HI>Fir&s;t Covenant,</HI> &s;aith to them, <HI>This do and live;</HI> and doth not endeavour to &s;hew them that there is &s;omething more <HI>wanting,</HI> without which they are undone, will be found an Enemy of Grace and a Murderer of Souls: Nor would I have &s;uch a Mini&s;ter's Ac|count to give in the la&s;t Day, for a Thou&s;and Worlds.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Further,</HI> From what has been di&s;cours'd, we learn our Obli|gations of <HI>Gratitude</HI> to the God of all Grace for his infinite Com|pa&s;&s;ion towards us, in providing &s;o happily for our <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> be|fore him, by &s;ending his dear Son to <HI>bring in everla&s;ting Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the grand Relief of a guilty World.&mdash; And what has been &s;aid, teaches us to admire the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of God, in not com|pleating the <HI>Sanctification</HI> of his People at pre&s;ent; that &s;o <HI>the
<PB N="61" REF="006500_0063_102914EBDC007CD0">
Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by Faith,</HI> might have its due Honours re&s;erv'd to it, and the Riches of Divine Grace appear the more con&s;picuous in the Saint's eternal Salvation.&mdash; Hereby al&s;o we learn the <HI>Importance</HI> of yielding a firm Credit and &s;erious Attention to tho&s;e peculiar Doctrines of Revelation, concerning <HI>Original Sin, imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Ju&s;tification by Faith only, the Sove|reignty of God in Salvation,</HI> &amp;c. Doctrines &s;o clearly exhibited in the Scriptures, and &s;triking directly at that <HI>Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Self-Confidence, and &s;piritual Pride, &s;o hazardous and &s;o natural to vain Man.&mdash; We learn likewi&s;e the Nece&s;&s;ity there was of the Prote&s;tant <HI>Reformation;</HI> the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s and Dangerou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;ent <HI>Defection</HI> from it (in Point both of Opinion &amp; Prac|tice) &s;o vi&s;ibly prevalent in many Parts of the World call'd <HI>Re|formed;</HI> and the Improbability of a general Revival of the <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t, without a general Revival of the true <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Spirit and Principles.&mdash; We moreover learn the <HI>pitiable Ca&s;e</HI> of Multitudes of Souls in the Chri&s;tian World, that are under the Di&s;advantage of having no other or little better than <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Guides; who by their corrupt, unfaithful, or un&s;kilful Mini&s;try &s;ooth and flatter them in a Way of <HI>Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> cheri&s;hing the Spirit of the <HI>Old Covenant</HI> and thwarting that of the <HI>New,</HI> to the no little Hazard of their eternal Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Again, We have awful Ground from what has been &s;aid, to fear, that the <HI>Number</HI> of true Believers in the profe&s;&s;ing World, is com|paratively very <HI>&s;mall;</HI> in that Multitudes di&s;cover a prevalent Spirit and Principle the Rever&s;e of that of the <HI>Prophet</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> who&s;e Examples were recorded for our Admonition; and &s;o few appear heartily concurring to the Saints united Confe&s;&s;ion in Di&s;paragement of <HI>their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash; We &s;hall do wi&s;ely to <HI>examine</HI> into our own Sentiment and Di&s;po&s;ition of Heart con|cerning <HI>our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and very &s;eriou&s;ly inquire whe|ther we have the <HI>&s;ame Mind</HI> in us, as was in the&s;e humble Saints, who&s;e <HI>Renunciations</HI> of their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s we've been re|flecting upon.&mdash; And &s;uch as are con&s;cious they were never bro't to look upon <HI>their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> as <HI>filthy Rags</HI> or <HI>as Dung,</HI> and accordingly to renounce it in Point of Dependance upon it for <HI>Ju&s;tification of Life,</HI> may by the Light of tho&s;e Examples in our Text &s;ee their <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Self-Confidence</HI> detected and con|demned.&mdash; The&s;e Examples read Le&s;&s;ons of <HI>Reproof</HI> to the <HI>Chil|dren of God,</HI> who are often too indulgent to Unbelief and &s;piritual Pride, &s;ad Remains whereof in various Degrees are found even in the Regenerate; but much more to &s;elf-deluding <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> who (notwith&s;tanding all their &s;eeming Experiences &amp; moral Re|finements)

are &s;till unhappy Strangers to that Faith and Self-denial requir'd in the Go&s;pel, and are under the full Dominion of &s;piritual Pride and Unbelief; and mo&s;t of all to tho&s;e <HI>gro&s;s</HI> Di&s;&s;emblers in Religion, who con&s;ciou&s;ly live in the habitual Practice of Sin, but for a Di&s;gui&s;e put on a Profe&s;&s;ion of Godline&s;s and make a Shew of virtuous Action, in &s;ome particular In&s;tances. If the <HI>real</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es of truly good Men, by Rea&s;on of their Imper|fections, are comparatively but as <HI>Dung</HI> or <HI>filthy Rags,</HI> much more &s;o are the heartle&s;s Duties of unregenerate Morali&s;ts, and &s;till more &s;o the <HI>feigned</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es of de&s;igning <HI>Hypocrites.</HI> Prov. 21.27. <HI>The Sacrifice of the Wicked is Abomination: How much more when he bringeth it with a wicked Mind?</HI> &mdash; But &s;till how much more abominable and filthy is <HI>Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> it&s;elf! How malignant an Evil is <HI>Sin,</HI> that &s;tains and blemi&s;hes the very <HI>Righ|teou&s;ne&s;&s;es</HI> of Saints! How odious and pernicious then is <HI>reigning Sin!</HI> more &s;o than the <HI>Poi&s;on of A&s;ps,</HI> which can but kill the Body, when Sin de&s;troys the precious Soul! But above all, what a dreadful Sin is habitual and final <HI>Unbelief,</HI> which binds on the Guilt of other Sins and the Cur&s;e of the Law, and con&s;igns the Sinner over to eternal Damnation, without a Remedy! <HI>The Sting of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law.</HI> How vile the Character, how mi&s;erable the State, of the unrenew'd and unpardon'd Sinner!</P>
<P>But to conclude,</P>
<P>Let what has been &s;aid awaken us all to a ju&s;t Concern, <HI>that we may win Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>be found in him; not having for our Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s that which is of Law</HI> (inherent in our &s;elves and im|perfect) <HI>but that which is of God by Faith.</HI> Let us often review the Examples of the Prophet and Apo&s;tle, and learn of them to renounce <HI>our own</HI> defective <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es, as filthy Rags</HI> and as <HI>Dung,</HI> comparatively to CHRIST'S &s;potle&s;s perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and relatively to <HI>Ju&s;tification of Life.</HI> A deep abiding Convicti|on of this great Truth will have a happy Tendency, to make Chri&s;t precious to us, and excite us to live by the Faith of the Son of God; to rai&s;e our Admiration of the Love of God in Chri&s;t, and in&s;pire us with humble Gratitude; to fill us with &s;elf-aba&s;ing Thoughts, and make us humble in all our Approaches to the Throne of Grace; to put us upon ju&s;tifying God in his afflic|tive Di&s;pen&s;ations, and being contented with all the Allotments of his holy Providence; to teach us Charity, Meekne&s;s and For|bearance towards our Fellow-Chri&s;tians; and in a Word, to in|flame our De&s;ires after another and better Country, even an hea|venly, where our per&s;onal Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall no more be pol|luted

and di&s;graced by the Remains of Sin, but be perfect and immaculate as that of the Angels of God, and we &s;hall &s;hine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of our heavenly Father.&mdash;Let us there|fore be much in &s;tudying this profitable Subject, and much in Prayer to God, that he would open our Under&s;tandings to under|&s;tand the Scriptures referring to this important Point of Truth, and give us, of his Grace, to feel the Force &amp; experience the Be|nefit of an effectual Per&s;ua&s;ion: that a <HI>&s;elf-righteous</HI> Spirit may be &s;ubdu'd in us, and a humble <HI>Faith</HI> towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t may be ingenerated, invigorated, and actuated in us by the Power of the Holy Gho&s;t, and made to exert its Influence upon us, for the daily increa&s;ing Mortification of Sin and Self, and for the promoting a Life of Communion with Chri&s;t and Devotedne&s;s to him, as well as Dependance upon him.&mdash; For we &s;hould always be mindful, that Chri&s;t is the Object of our <HI>Obedience,</HI> as well as of our Faith; and that he is of God made unto us, not only <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> but <HI>Sanctification.</HI> While therefore, in Compari|&s;on of imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s &amp; in Reference to Ju&s;tification before God, we renounce all our own imperfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s as <HI>Dung</HI> and as <HI>filthy Rags,</HI> yet neverthele&s;s let us at the &s;ame Time be careful to pre&s;erve and expre&s;s a due Honour and Regard for <HI>per|&s;onal Holine&s;s,</HI> as valuable on other Accounts and u&s;eful for o|ther Ends. Let us not fail to realize the Stability of the mo|ral Law as a Rule of humane Life, our indi&s;pen&s;able Obligation to Obedience, and the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of practical Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty; tho' not with any View to our acquiring a Right to Pardon and Peace with God, yet with a View to the Glory of God concern'd therein, with a View to our being <HI>meet for the Ma&s;ter's U&s;e</HI> here and for his bli&s;sful Pre&s;ence hereafter, and with a View to evidencing the Sincerity of our <HI>Faith,</HI> and &s;o the Truth of our Preten&s;ion to be at <HI>Peace with God:</HI> Becau&s;e, as it is the Office of Faith to apply Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s for <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> &s;o it is the Nature of Faith to rely on his Strength and Grace for <HI>Sanctification,</HI> and by Motives from the Love of Chri&s;t to con|&s;train us to Obedience.

<P>It is a remarkable Pa&s;&s;age, to our Purpo&s;e, that in TIT. 3.8. <HI>The&s;e Things I will that thou affirm con&s;tantly, that they which have believed in God, might be careful to maintain good Works: the&s;e Things are good and profitable unto Men.</HI> The Apo&s;tle had ju&s;t before been opening the Doctrine of Grace, in &s;ome of its mo&s;t important Branches, and the&s;e Things which he had now been &s;aying, he would have <HI>Titus</HI> to confirm and inculcate in his Mi|ni&s;try, to the End that Believers might by the&s;e Truths be put upon a Care to excell in good Works.&mdash;With this View then, let us be much in meditating upon this Doctrine, firmly believe, and wi&s;ely apply it. Let us pur&s;ue it to its genuine Purpo&s;es, to e&s;tabli&s;h our <HI>Faith</HI> in Chri&s;t, and thereby to promote our <HI>Obedi|ence;</HI> which indeed, if it be not the <HI>Obedience of Faith,</HI> will nei|ther be plea&s;ing to God nor profitable to us.
