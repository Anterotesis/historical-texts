<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE all very &s;en&s;ibly feel the Blow of <HI>GOD'S</HI> Sovereign Hand, in the late awful and af|fecting In&s;tance of Mortality; which &s;udden|ly beheaded Kingdoms, &amp; delug'd Nations</P>
<P>WAS it po&s;&s;ible then for King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> the Great and Good, whom irre&s;i&s;tible Death has ravi&s;h'd from us, to &s;lide &s;ilently into his Grave?</P>
<P>WHO can forbear following Him with that mournful Cry, <HI>My Father, My Father! The Chariots of I&s;rael and the Hor&s;e-men thereof!</HI> Who can forbear this, that has in his brea&s;t the lea&s;t &s;park of Ingenuity and Gratitude, or any thing of the true Engli&s;h Tem|per, or Prote&s;tant Principles! Sure I am the Man mu&s;t be abandon'd to a wretched Stoici&s;m, or be under the power of a &s;candalous Indifference to the grand Cau&s;e of Civil Liberty, and the Reformed Religion, that does not regret the Lo&s;s of a Prince, who has been &s;o celebrated, &s;o avow'd a Patron of them both, the Light of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and the Terror of all their Adver&s;aries: A Prince who&s;e con&s;picuous Excellencies and mo&s;t au&s;picious Reign may well be the Wonder and Prai&s;e of all Po&s;terity, as they are very much the Triumph &amp; Admiration of the pre&s;ent Day.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="002873_0004_0FE67FB87B4D6198">IMPOSSIBLE it &s;eem'd to me for any one to refrain from mingling his Tears with the publick Sor|rows, and adding a Voice to the Con&s;ort of Mourners, upon this melancholy Occa&s;ion: which for my own part I cou'd not tell how to pa&s;s over in Silence.</P>
<P><HI>SIR,</HI> THE following Sermon pretends to very little &s;ingular, be&s;ides what has been already publi&s;h'd among us by &s;ome of my Brethren. I have not at|tempted his late Maje&s;ty's <HI>CHARACTER;</HI> A Work fit for the be&s;t Orator of the Age, and va&s;tly above any Talent of mine: nor cou'd any expect from the Pulpit his Royal <HI>HISTORY.</HI> I have but made a few general Touches upon things, with the Simplicity and practical Turn, that I apprehend always mo&s;t becoming the &s;acred Desk: &mdash; Humbly to expre&s;s my deep Sen&s;e of <HI>BRITAIN'S</HI> &amp; <HI>NEW-ENGLAND'S</HI> Lo&s;s in the Death we have been call'd to Mourn; together with my loyal Concurrence in the common Joy at the happy Succe&s;&s;ion of the High &amp; mighty Prince <HI>GEORGE</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> to the <HI>Briti&s;h THRONE,</HI> whereby the &s;overeign Dominion of the&s;e dependent Provinces, and other Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> is come into his rightful and gracious Hands. Which pre&s;ages a new Scene of Glory, to enliven our Hopes, and openeth tho&s;e &s;plendid Pro&s;pects before us, that may ju&s;tly correct the pa&s;&s;ionate Griefs of the pre&s;ent Sea&s;on: And we tru&s;t the Smiles of his Royal Grace &amp; Cle|mency will &s;oon di&s;&s;ipate all our Clouds, and intirely rever&s;e the gloomy Reflections of this dark Day.</P>
<P><HI>SIR,</HI> YOU'l pardon me that I have pre&s;um'd to in&s;cribe your honourable <HI>NAME</HI> in the front of this unfini&s;h'd Di&s;cour&s;e: which, I was the le&s;s backward to comply with the Reque&s;t of &s;ome of my Friends, in thus expo&s;ing to View, if it might be &s;hrouded under your favourable Umbrage.

have a kind Reception with you; e&s;pecially when I reflected on the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> it was preach'd upon, which as it required me to put on a &s;able Habit, &s;o allow'd me to &s;peak with faultring Accents: And when I con|&s;ider'd how highly grateful the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> &amp; Tenour of my Di&s;cour&s;e mu&s;t undoubtedly be to <HI>ONE,</HI> who&s;e in|violable Loyalty to our late glorious Sovereign, &amp; Zeal for the Prote&s;tant Blood in his illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, are &s;o known &amp; undi&s;puted, that they leave no po&s;&s;ible room to &s;u&s;pect your candid Con&s;truction of the feeble&s;t Effort to do Honour to the &s;acred Memory of that admirable Prince, and to inculcate a wi&s;e &amp; pious Improvement of the National Lo&s;s, that &s;o our <HI>GOD the Judge,</HI> may gain &s;ome Glory thereby.</P>
<P>PERMIT me now to condole your <HI>HONOUR'S</HI> particular &s;hare in the common Bereavement. &mdash;</P>
<P><HI>SIR,</HI> I make no doubt you religiou&s;ly entertain the Admonition, that Heaven &s;ends you of your own Mor|tality, in this &s;evere Stroke, which comes &s;o near you.</P>
<P>I pray GOD confirm your <HI>HONOUR'S</HI> Health, and prolong your Opportunities of &s;erving your KING, and your native Country: who have hitherto &s;een You, thro' the Grace of GOD (and to the glory of that Grace be it &s;poken) &s;o faithful &amp; prudent in the Con|duct of your honorable and weighty Tru&s;t; in tho&s;e critical &amp; difficult Junctures you have pa&s;&s;ed thorow; &s;o equally holding the Ballance, duly a&s;&s;erting the Rights &amp; Prerogatives of your Royal Ma&s;ter, while yet you have been tender of the Subjects Liberty and Privilege; to your own great Reputation, &amp; to the Security &amp; Flouri&s;hing of the Public in its mo&s;t valuable Concerns.</P>

<P>MAY you al&s;o ever experience much of the &s;piritual and gracious Pre&s;ence of your Covenant-GOD with you, in the more private Concerns of the Chri&s;tian Life!

<P>AND now, <HI>SIR,</HI> I beg Leave to recommend my Self, with my Family who are &s;o much your own Fle&s;h, and my dear Church, where you receiv'd your Bapti&s;m, and which you are pleas'd to favour with your &s;tated Pre&s;ence in our public Wor&s;hip &amp; Communion, to an affectionate Remembrance in your devout Addre&s;&s;es to the Throne of Grace; where I doubt not you are daily carrying the Ca&s;e, not only of your Per&s;on &amp; Family, but al&s;o of your Friends, and of this whole People, who look upon you as their common Father. <HI>SIR,</HI> We are per&s;uaded that you love <HI>Zion,</HI> and pray for her Peace; that you will &s;eek the Good of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> all your days; and that the Honour of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> the &s;upreme Maje&s;ty &amp; Head of his Body the Church, by whom Kings reign, who&s;e you are &amp; whom you &s;erve, lies ever near your Heart, as your governing End.

<P>AT the very fir&s;t mention of this Text, I doubt not, your Thoughts have in&s;tantly recurr'd to the &s;urprizing News and &s;o|lemn Occa&s;ions of the la&s;t Week <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Sermon was preach'd on the next <HI>Lord's-Day</HI> after the Advice of the KING's Death.</NOTE>; which there are none of you &s;uch Strangers in I&s;rael, as to be ignorant of. That's the Language of the Day, <HI>Know ye not that a Prince and a great Man is fallen!</HI> The KING is dead! King GEORGE is dead! &mdash; Very melancholy Tidings indeed, that &s;truck an univer&s;al Damp on the Spirits of his loyal Subjects here. And we mu&s;t have been &s;ighing out our Sorrow, with the mo&s;t dejected Airs, and in all the Accents of a de&s;perate Grief; were it not for the refre&s;hing Mixture of Joy &amp; Hope in the concurring Advices of a NEW <HI>KING,</HI> peaceably &s;eated on the Throne: Which Reflection creates a &s;en&s;ible Tumult among the contending Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind, and makes it difficult to know how to frame our Speech
<PB N="2" REF="002873_0008_0FE67FD29C8B8690">
or model our Countenances, whether for Joy or Sorrow mo&s;t. Like the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Cloud, the pre|&s;ent Di&s;pen&s;ation hath a double A&s;pect; has it's bright &s;ide. No &s;ooner is the Light of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> extingui&s;h'd; but another Sun a&s;cends the Horizon to our grate|ful Surprize. &mdash; We have been liberally pouring out our tributary Tears of Sorrow at the funeral Ob|&s;equies of a decea&s;ed Sovereign, his late MAJESTY KING <HI>GEORGE,</HI> who&s;e Memory is ble&s;&s;ed: and in the &s;ame day the &s;welling Tide of our con|fluent Affections took a &s;udden Turn into another Channel, and our Tears of Joy irre&s;i&s;tibly flow'd out with equal Plenty, at the loud Congratulations of our pre&s;ent Sovereign KING <HI>GEORGE the Second,</HI> upon his happy Succe&s;&s;ion to his late Royal FATHER'S Crown &amp; Dignity.</P>
<P>OUR GOD is giving us to <HI>Sing both of Mercy, and of Judgment: and unto thee, O Lord, I will Sing.</HI> We may ju&s;tly temper the &s;orrowful Sen&s;e of our common Bereavement, with the con&s;olatory Tho't of that Royal Life, which now inherits the Crown, and with the happy Pro&s;pect before us of a la&s;ting Succe&s;&s;ion in that Royal Line, which is &s;o much the Joy of <HI>Britain,</HI> and the Hope of the whole <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t thro'out the World. &mdash; For we have not only another Prote&s;tant KING up|on the Throne now: but as if this were a &s;mall thing, the Lord our GOD is al&s;o &s;peaking of his Ser|vant's Hou&s;e <HI>for a great while to come.</HI> And now let it plea&s;e the Lord to ble&s;s the Hou&s;e of his Ser|vant, that it may be e&s;tabli&s;h'd for ever! On HIM and on his late&s;t Royal Po&s;terity, let the Crown flouri&s;h: but let his Enemies lick the du&s;t, and melt away; the Cau&s;e of a Popi&s;h Pretender be for ever bla&s;ted, and Confu&s;ion attend the unrea&s;onable At|tempts of &s;uch as wou'd make them a Captain to re|turn into <HI>Egypt.</HI> &mdash; O the Folly of a re&s;tle&s;s di&s;af|fected Party in the Nation, that know not their own Happine&s;s! A&s;toni&s;hing the Madne&s;s of Loyalty, fal&s;ely &s;o called, which can't be &s;atisfy'd without

the glorious Chains of Romi&s;h Tyranny! The &s;tupidity of the Men, to court their own Ruin! That have Plenty of Happine&s;s round about them: but make them&s;elves poor by Di&s;content, and mi&s;erable by Envy! O the folly of Men, that flatter them|&s;elves, again&s;t all po&s;&s;ible Checks &amp; Frowns of Hea|ven, with the vain a&s;piring Hope of &s;eeing their pre|tended <HI>Heir</HI> one Day re&s;tor'd to his natural Rights, and &s;waying the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Sceptre: And they under Him &s;haring among them&s;elves all public Honours!</P>
<P>I wou'd turn them to our Context, where we find very appo&s;ite Language to addre&s;s them in: &mdash; <HI>I &s;aid to the Fools, Deal not fooli&s;hly: and to the Wicked, Lift not up the Horn. Lift not up your Horn on high: Speak not with a &s;tiff Neck. For Promotion cometh neither from the Ea&s;t, nor from the We&s;t, nor from the South. But</HI> (as it follows in our Text) <HI>GOD is the Judge: He putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another.</HI></P>
<P>THE words are part of an <HI>Hymn</HI> of Thanks|giving, which is generally tho't to have been pen'd by <HI>David</HI> (or by <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> in the Per&s;on of <HI>David,</HI> as his Poet-Laureat) at his Royal Highne&s;s's Acce&s;|&s;ion to the Throne of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> Or, as &s;ome think, it may be an Ab&s;tract of &s;ome <HI>Speech</HI> made by King <HI>David</HI> to a Convention of the States, at his coming to the Crown: which <HI>A&s;aph</HI> might turn into Ver&s;e, and publi&s;h in a Poem to make it the more popular. Noble Language it is, to come from the Throne! Alas! That we hear &s;o little of any &s;uch devotional Strains, either in Declarations &amp; Speeches of crown'd Heads, or in Addre&s;&s;es to Thrones in our Day.</P>
<P>THE Royal Author, in very emphatical Terms, devoutly <HI>gives Thanks</HI> to GOD, and re&s;olves to <HI>&s;ing Prai&s;es for ever to the God of Jacob,</HI> who had anoin|ted him to be King, and done &s;o many great &amp; good things for his People &amp; Him. Then as a ju&s;t Return of Gratitude, he lays him&s;elf under the bond of a
<PB N="4" REF="002873_0010_0FE67FD400A89440">
&s;olemn Promi&s;e, to manage his great Tru&s;t with <HI>In|tegrity,</HI> and exert him&s;elf for the publick Weal. He &s;eems to expre&s;s his Hope of a <HI>pro&s;perous</HI> Reign, by the Will of GOD, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent cloudy po&s;ture of Affairs, thro' the prevalence of <HI>Parties</HI> and <HI>Factions</HI> in the Kingdom; which nece&s;&s;arily weaken the Strength and &s;lur the Beauty of any Government.</P>
<P>HE hopes to <HI>bear up the Pillars</HI> of the Land; to &s;upport a ju&s;t Authority: and makes that Decla|ration, truly worthy a religious Prince; &mdash; <HI>All the horns of the</HI> Wicked <HI>will I cut off, but the horns of the</HI> Righteous <HI>&s;hall be exalted.</HI></P>
<P>HE gives a public Rebuke to the in&s;olent Oppo&s;ers of his Government; whether the di&s;&s;olute Wretches, that hated him for his known Zeal in Religion, and were for doing all in their power to ob&s;truct the due Ad|mini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice: Or that malignant Party in the Nation, that boldly &s;truck at the King's Head, and deny'd his Right of Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown; who had proclaim'd <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth, Saul</HI>'s Son, to be King, and appear'd in open Arms again&s;t <HI>David.</HI> Many violently oppos'd his Settlement on the Throne; rais'd one audacious Rebellion after another in favour of the then &mdash; Pretender; and there was a long &s;truggle between the hou&s;e of <HI>Saul</HI> and the hou&s;e of <HI>David: &mdash; Abner,</HI> General of the Army, and other Men in place, making them&s;elves &s;trong for the hou&s;e of <HI>Saul.</HI> &mdash; But <HI>David</HI> was not afraid of their Terror: His Enemies made very loud Boa&s;ts, and heap'd all po&s;&s;ible In&s;ults upon him: But as a religious King, he boldly <HI>appeals for Ju&s;tice,</HI> to that GOD who is King of Kings, the grand di&s;po&s;er of all earthly Crowns &amp; Kingdoms: and as a Royal Prophet he <HI>foretells the De&s;truction</HI> of his unrelenting Adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>"IN &s;inging this P&s;alm (&s;ays a pious Expo&s;itor) we mu&s;t give to GOD the glory of all the Revolu|tions of States &amp; Kingdoms; believing that they are all according to his Coun&s;el, and He will make them all to work together for the Good of his Church.
<PB N="5" REF="002873_0011_0FE67FD42D893A00">
We &s;ometimes &s;ee &s;trange Revolutions in Kingdoms and States, and are &s;urpriz'd at the &s;udden Di&s;grace [or Decea&s;e] of &s;ome, and Elevation of others: We are <HI>full</HI> of the Changes, when they happen. But here we are directed to look at the <HI>Author</HI> of them: and are taught where the Original of <HI>Power</HI> is, and from whence <HI>Promotion</HI> comes. Whence comes Pre|ferment <HI>to</HI> Kingdoms; to the Sovereignty of them? Whence come Preferments <HI>in</HI> Kingdoms, to &s;ubordi|nate places of Power &amp; Tru&s;t? The former de|pends not on the Will of the <HI>People,</HI> nor the latter on the Will of the <HI>Prince:</HI> but both on the Will of GOD, who has all Hearts in his hand.&mdash;There|fore to GOD alone; <HI>David</HI> would give the <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> of his Advancement: Therefore having receiv'd his Power from GOD, he would <HI>u&s;e</HI> it <HI>for</HI> him, and hopes in him for Divine Conduct &amp; Support: and therefore they were <HI>Fools,</HI> that lifted up the horn again&s;t him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING thus open'd the De&s;ign &amp; Scope of the P&s;alm, we may now centre our Tho'ts on the Text in particular, which I have cho&s;en for the Subject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e. And here we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. A general Truth a&s;&s;erted; <HI>GOD is the Judge.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. AN Application of it to two particular Ca&s;es: <HI>He putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall con&s;ider the &s;everal Paragraphs or Clau&s;es, in the order wherein they lie here: And accordingly,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> WE may employ our Thoughts for a while on that general Truth, GOD <HI>is the</HI> JUDGE.</P>
<P>THIS Title, in it's more re&s;train'd and proper no|tion, is the name of a judiciary under-officer in the State, who&s;e Province it is to hear &amp; determine Cau&s;es refer'd to him, to apply &amp; execute the Laws, and to
<PB N="6" REF="002873_0012_0FE67FDCDD9DF860">
di&s;tribute Ju&s;tice between Man &amp; Man. But it is &s;ometimes us'd in a more exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, &s;o as to take in the Characters of Lawgiver &amp; King, and is apply'd to the Prince or Chief Ruler. So the extraordinary Governors, which GOD rais'd up &amp; plac'd at the head of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, between the Times of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>Saul,</HI> were &s;tiled <HI>Judges.</HI></P>
<P>THE LORD our GOD is Judge, in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive View of the Word. The very Name of GOD carries in it <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> the height of Dominion and judicial Power. He that is GOD, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be conceiv'd of, as the Supreme Being, the highe&s;t Authority, who gives Law to all, and judgeth all.</P>
<P>THE incomparable <HI>Excellencies</HI> of his mo&s;t perfect Nature <HI>qualify</HI> Him to be the Judge. <HI>Among the Gods, there is none like unto Him:</HI> None of like Ca|pacity; none of like Merit, with Him. &mdash; Now this is the Order of Nature &amp; Rea&s;on, that the Greater and more Excellent &s;hould rule &amp; judge the Le&s;&s;er.</P>
<P>AND then the various Superiour <HI>Relations,</HI> which GOD &s;u&s;tains toward the World, <HI>intitle</HI> Him to be the Judge. Thus, He is the great Creator &amp; high Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven &amp; Earth: the fir&s;t Cau&s;e, and the la&s;t End of the Creature: the continual Pre&s;erver, and bountiful Benefactor of the Univer&s;e. &mdash; He has therefore an indi&s;putable Right to pre&s;cribe Rules &amp; Laws to the World; to in&s;pect the Behaviour of his Creatures, and call them to an Account, concerning their Regards to his Authority, and Improvement of his Favours, which are only &s;o many Talents, of which they are but Stewards, and &s;o accountable.</P>
<P>Hence, THE Scriptures, which were given by In|&s;piration of GOD, do every where a&s;&s;ert his Character, as <HI>Judge.</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t draws up that Conclu&s;ion, <HI>Verily he is a God that judgeth in the Earth</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 58.11.</NOTE>.

He gives Laws to the whole Creation: All the Laws of Nature, Rea&s;on, and Re|velation are equally the Re&s;ult of his Sovereign Will and Plea&s;ure. All Things come to pa&s;s by the deter|minate Coun&s;el &amp; Foreknowlege of GOD. He worketh all things according to the Plea&s;ure of his own Will. He pa&s;&s;eth Sentence, and gives it Accompli&s;hment: decrees the Event, and gives it Exi&s;tence. Execution is the Life of the Law; and this is the peculiar care of his &s;uperintending Providence. The Sufferings of the pre&s;ent time are the Inflictions of his <HI>corrective</HI> Hand. The Mi&s;eries of Hell are the Effects of his <HI>destroying</HI> Vengence. And the Ble&s;&s;ings both of Heaven and Earth are the Di&s;plays of his <HI>remunerative</HI> Grace and Bounty. Thus then GOD is the Judge, to all Intents and Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>AND now, If you inquire into his CHARACTER and Properties; I will give you the &s;ame, in the following Hints; which might very profitably be enlarg'd upon, but de&s;igning only a &s;ingle Di&s;cour&s;e, upon the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, I mu&s;t &s;tudy Brevity.</P>
<P>TO proceed then,</P>
<P>GOD is a mo&s;t <HI>Rightful</HI> Judge. His &s;everal Claims, which are all founded in the &s;tricted Equity, have been already recited.</P>
<P>HE is a <HI>Royal</HI> Judge. Not a judicial Mini&s;ter, as the greate&s;t Lord-chief-Ju&s;tice upon Earth is, and no more; but an inthron'd Judge; Imperial Maje&s;ty &s;itting in Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002873_0014_0FE67FDE766DB358">HE is an <HI>Independent, Self-&s;ufficient, Almighty</HI> Judge: Derives not his Power from any, nor depends on any for the Continuance or Exerci&s;e of it: Needeth none to &s;tand as Witne&s;&s;es, or &s;it as A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors with Him, in the Judgment, or a&s;&s;i&s;t in Execution. He is <HI>omni|pre&s;ent,</HI> and omni&s;cient; that none can hide them&s;elves in Darkne&s;s, nor fly out of his Reach. Infinitely <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> that none can deceive him by fal&s;e appearances, or out|wit Him by &s;ubtil Rea&s;onings; Un&s;earchable in his Judgments, and his Tho'ts very deep: confounding all the Policy of Hell &amp; Earth. &mdash; And equal is his <HI>Power;</HI> his Will irre&s;i&s;tible, his Hand uncontroulable. Who hath been his Coun&s;ellor? or who can di&s;annul his Judgment? Who art thou, O man, that replie&s;t again&s;t GOD!</P>
<P>Moreover, HE is a mo&s;t <HI>Patient</HI> and <HI>Compa&s;&s;ionate</HI> Judge: Seated on a Throne of Grace; Long-&s;uffering and abundant in Goodne&s;s: Slow to Anger, and ready to forgive: not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h: not dealing with us after our Iniquities, but in the mid&s;t of Judgment remembring Mercy: leaving Room for Repentance, and be&s;eeching Sinners to be reconciled to Him: Making all po&s;&s;ible allowances to his People, for human Infirmities: He will not break the brui&s;ed Reed, nor quench the &s;moaking Flax. Commi&s;erating all our Wants and Mi&s;eries: He is Eyes to the Blind, Ears to the Deaf, Feet to the Lame, a Shepherd to the Poor, a Father to the Orphan, and the Judge of Widows.</P>
<P>Again, HE is a mo&s;t <HI>Equal</HI> &amp; <HI>Impartial</HI> Judge: always unerring &amp; exact in his Precepts, his Sen|tences &amp; Executions: &s;teady to the Rules of Law and Ju&s;tice, Wi&s;dom &amp; Goodne&s;s, by which he propor|tions Rewards &amp; Puni&s;hments: Firm to his own E&s;tabli&s;hments, true to his Word, and doing nothing by ab&s;olute Prerogative, or mere arbitrary Will, &s;o as to violate the wi&s;e &amp; ju&s;t Con&s;titutions of his King|dom. Far be it from GOD, rhat He &s;hou'd do Ini|quity: and from the Almighty, that He &s;hou'd
<PB N="9" REF="002873_0015_0FE67FDE9BEA4550">
pervert Judgment! With Him there is no unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s; no re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, nor taking of Gifts. He is a mo&s;t holy &amp; upright Judge: will by no means ju&s;tify the Wicked, nor condemn the Righteous.</P>
<P>HE is an <HI>Univer&s;al</HI> &amp; <HI>Everla&s;ting</HI> Judge. GOD is the Judge of all, the Judge of Quick &amp; Dead, of Men &amp; Angels. He rides in Circuit thro' the Hea|vens, and his Eyes run to and fro in all the Earth: be|holding the Evil &amp; the Good; di&s;pen&s;ing Puni&s;hments and Rewards. His Powers and Operations are mo&s;t <HI>con&s;tant,</HI> unwearied and never cea&s;ing: He continually attends on this very thing, In&s;pecting; governing and judging in the Earth. And in the la&s;t day, that great day of A&s;&s;i&s;es, the whole World &s;hall be conven'd before his Judgment-Seat, and all having given an Account of them&s;elves to GOD, &s;hall receive their va|rious Dooms, according to their different Conduct in the pre&s;ent State. GOD will &s;entence the Wicked to the Flames of Hell, but his Righteous ones to the Joys of Heaven. And this will be an <HI>Eternal</HI> Judgment: in&s;tantly executed, without any Reprieve; without any Appeal, &amp; without all po&s;&s;ibility of being revers'd. The Sentences then pronounc'd, &s;hall be to all Eter|nity in Execution. GOD will &s;it King for ever: and of his Dominion &amp; Judgment there &s;hall be no End; no Period to Everla&s;ting.</P>
<P>NOW let the&s;e Sayings &s;ink down into our Hearts, and have a powerful Influence on our Tempers and Deportments.</P>
<P>WHAT has been &s;aid may &s;erve to <HI>rai&s;e</HI> our Appre|hen&s;ions of the excellent <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> of the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD; and of the Lord Je&s;us, to whom all Judg|ment is committed, that Men &s;hould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. O let his Excellency make us afraid. The greate&s;t of Mortals may well tremble at his Pre&s;ence. The Tho't of his all-&s;eeing Eye, and righteous Tribunal, may well &s;trike an uni|ver&s;al Terror on the World. Let all the Earth fear before Him. Let the Princes &amp; Judges of the Earth,
<PB N="10" REF="002873_0016_0FE67FE6794C6560">
fear his Name: for He is King of Kings, Lord of Lords, and Judge of Judges. They &s;tand on a common Level with others, before GOD, and are equally ob|noxious to his terrible Di&s;plea&s;ure. He will break the Teeth of the Ungodly, and da&s;h them in pieces with a Rod of Iron. <HI>Be wi&s;e now therefore, O ye</HI> Kings: <HI>be in&s;tructed, ye</HI> Judges <HI>of the Earth. Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoyce with Trembling. Ki&s;s the Feet of the</HI> SON of GOD, <HI>le&s;t he be angry, and your way peri&s;h.</HI> Will ye provoke the Lord of Ho&s;ts to Jealou&s;y? Are ye &s;tronger than He? Or thinke&s;t thou this, O Man, which judge&s;t others who do &s;uch things and doe&s;t the &s;ame, That thou &s;halt e&s;cape the Judgment of GOD! Verily none ever harden'd them&s;elves again&s;t GOD, and pro&s;per'd. &mdash; Let us all carry it &s;uitably to our glorious LORD; prepare to give our Account, and engage our Judge to be our Friend.</P>
<P>Furthermore, HERE is an excelling <HI>Pattern</HI> for all Rulers &amp; Judges to form &amp; govern their Conduct by. Let the many admirable Excellencies of this Heavenly and Chief Judge be attended to, and drawn into Imi|tation by our Earthly Governors: So &s;hall we have our Judges as at the fir&s;t, and venerate them as little Images of GOD upon Earth.</P>
<P>Again, Here is matter of abundant <HI>Con&s;olation</HI> to the People of GOD.</P>
<P>THIS glorious Judge is their Friend, their avow'd Friend, and He will &s;ave them. How &s;afe &amp; happy mu&s;t they be, who have &s;ecur'd an Intere&s;t in tne Favour of GOD the Judge of all! He will chu&s;e all their Changes for them. He will plead their Cau&s;e. again&s;t the Enemies of their Souls. No Evil hap|peneth to the Ju&s;t: but all things work together for Good. Reali&s;e it, O Believer, that GOD is the Judge, and that all his dealings with you are in Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and in Wi&s;dom. Let not your Heart then be troubled: but rejoyce in the Lord, and again I &s;ay, Rejoyce.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002873_0017_0FE67FE69BDE4700">NEITHER let your Heart be <HI>afraid.</HI> Don't di&s;tru&s;t the Power or Faithfulne&s;s of divine Provi|dence. Ca&s;t all your private Cares on the Lord, and He will &s;u&s;tain you. Commit al&s;o to Him the Church of GOD in the World, and refer all it's Con|cerns to his &s;overeign Di&s;po&s;e. He will plead the Cau&s;e of his People I&s;rael at all times, as the mat|ter may require; and will over-rule in all Ca&s;es for the &s;ecuring his own Intere&s;t and Glory. The Gates of Hell &s;hall not prevail. The Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s &s;hall not come. The Enemies of his Kingdom may con&s;pire with their united Force &amp; Rage again&s;t it; but they &s;hall imagin a vain thing. The Friends of <HI>Zion</HI> may die and fail, and &s;carce any of her Sons be left to take her by the hand: Yet GOD, who judgeth his People, lives and reigns world without end. And he can rai&s;e up &s;ucce&s;&s;ive In&s;truments, to &s;erve his De&s;igns: or el&s;e bring Salvation with his own immediate Arm. &mdash; The Lord our GOD is the &s;overeign Arbiter of the World, and ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;er of all Events. He balanceth the Clouds of Heaven; He weigheth the Mountains in Scales, and hangeth the Earth upon Nothing. He &s;itteth upon the Circle of the Univer&s;e: and his Arm ruleth over all the Kingdoms of Men. We often talk of Earthly Potentates holding the Balance among the Nations: But this mu&s;t be under&s;tood in a limited Sen&s;e, and with ju&s;t Re&s;erves to DIVINE Sovereignty. For GOD is <HI>the Judge,</HI> the &s;upreme Moderator, who mo&s;t truly holds the Balance of Power in his mighty hand, and turns the Scale on which &s;ide he will, go|verning all natural Cau&s;es and moral Agents, and over-ruling all public Actions, Re&s;olutions &amp; Events, as He plea&s;eth. The Hearts of <HI>Kings,</HI> and Affairs of States and Empires are under his Eye &amp; Influence; in|tirely &s;u&s;pended on his uncontrolable Determinations. Tru&s;t in HIM therefore, O ye People! The Lord reigneth: let not <HI>Zion</HI> be afraid.</P>
<P>Finally, LET us improve the Point before us to holy <HI>Thankfulne&s;s;</HI> admiring and magnifying our GOD the Judge, for all his great Goodne&s;s to <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> That
<PB N="12" REF="002873_0018_0FE67FE7D82D1A28">
He hath pleaded the Cau&s;e of his People, and up|held his Church in the World, amid&s;t innumerable Evils, Wars, Per&s;ecutions &amp; Oppre&s;&s;ions. The LORD is great in <HI>Zion:</HI> and He ruleth in the mid&s;t of his Enemies. Surely there is no Inchantment again&s;t <HI>Jacob.</HI> But <HI>I&s;rael</HI> may &s;et up their <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>Hitherto the Lord hath helped us!</HI></P>
<P>WHAT an admirable Train of glorious Deliveran|ces did GOD the Judge give his People in old Time to experience! The whole Story of the <HI>Jews</HI> is brighten'd with very numerous and mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing Memorials. &mdash; And the Conduct of Providence to|wards the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Church, both in the primitive and later Ages, has been almo&s;t equally full of Won|ders.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation in particular has been the Stage of many the mo&s;t remarkable Di&s;pen&s;ations. Not to go up higher than the&s;e la&s;t Centuries: &mdash; By what marvellous Methods of Providence was the ble&s;&s;ed REFORMATION from Popery accompli&s;h'd! And how has this glorious Intere&s;t been &s;ignally guarded, by an amazing Series of &s;pecial Interpo&s;iti|ons to this day! It hath pa&s;s'd thro' many a hazar|dous Cri&s;is, and been reduc'd to an expiring Po&s;ture time after time: But has receiv'd new Life, and been made to flouri&s;h again, by &s;ome happy Turn of Af|fairs, &s;o &s;udden &amp; unaccountable, that the <HI>Finger of GOD</HI> hath vi&s;ibly appear'd; It's Enemies them&s;elves being Judges: And all the World have been forc'd to &s;ay, <HI>Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous; Verily there is a GOD that judgeth in the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>AND here, How can I help taking a particular Notice of the wonderful Appearances of Heaven for our NON-CONFORMING Brethren at home; a de&s;pis'd, but truly valuable, mo&s;t loyal &amp; religious Part of the Nation: who have been further pro&s;ecuting the holy Aim of the Fir&s;t <HI>Reformers,</HI> and carrying on the Work they &s;o happily began! How &s;trangely has this feeble Intere&s;t been protected, when in the utmo&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="002873_0019_0FE645F2A21EF470">
Danger: and when in a &s;inking dying Condition, how oft recover'd, by the merciful Operations of a &s;pecial Providence!</P>
<P>OR how can I refrain mentioning the Salvation that has been nigh to NEW-ENGLAND! The Stones wou'd cry out, if I &s;hould pa&s;s over this in &s;ilence! But <HI>who can utter the mighty Acts of the Lord to|ward the Inhabitants of the&s;e Villages!</HI> The great Actions &amp; Specialties of Providence in favour of his Peo|ple here, have been many &amp; a&s;toni&s;hing: And afford Materials for as bright, as entertaining &amp; affecting a Story as any Place in the whole World, in the &s;ame Com|pa&s;s of Time, can furni&s;h out. For whether we reflect on the Beginning &amp; Ri&s;e, or Continuance &amp; Progre&s;s of the&s;e Plantations, that were begun upon a religious Foundation, we are on all &s;ides pre&s;ented with very wonderful Di&s;plays of the &s;aving Power, directing Wi&s;dom, beneficent Goodne&s;s, and unfailing Truth of our Covenant-GOD. A &s;ignal Hand of Providence has interpos'd from time to time in particular for the pre&s;ervation of our invaluable CHARTER-Con&s;titu|tion: &s;o much our Glory &amp; Strength, and a Protecti|on upon our deare&s;t Intere&s;ts, our Schools and Churches; but the Envy of Many in the World, who cea&s;e not crying, <HI>Ra&s;e it, Ra&s;e it from the very foundations.</HI> Yet it hath not fallen a Prey to their thir&s;ty Male|volence. Verily our GOD hath helped us: and ble&s;&s;ed be his Name. Next under his powerful and more immediate Care, the Continuance of our pre|cious Privileges and Freedoms is owing to tho&s;e <HI>Na|tional</HI> Mercies, which have extended their benign In|fluence to the&s;e di&s;tant Regions, the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI> However Men may glory in the Ble&s;&s;ing of the <HI>Re&s;toration,</HI> That wou'd have entail'd a Cur&s;e (rather) on Po&s;terity, had it not been for the happy Changes, that by a kind Di&s;po&s;ition of Providence, have &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed over the Kingdom. For, as a celebrated <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> B. Hoadly.</NOTE> of the

pre&s;ent Day ob&s;erves,
<Q>If you view the <HI>Re&s;toration,</HI> without the <HI>Revolution</HI> and the <HI>Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion,</HI> It leads you directly to a <HI>Popi&s;h Prince,</HI> holding an arbitrary Hand over all your Liberties; tearing up the Fences of all your Laws; fixing all <HI>Right</HI> in his own Will and Power; and per&s;ecuting all his Subjects into the Exerci&s;e of <HI>his own,</HI> &s;uper|&s;titious, idolatrous, and cruel Religion. And this is the whole of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> in which you wou'd &s;ee it end at la&s;t. A Ble&s;&s;ing, which may be a fit Reward for the <HI>&s;lavi&s;h Bigottry</HI> of <HI>Papi&s;ts!</HI> But for <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> &mdash; fit only for <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> of them, who de&s;erve it. And <HI>They</HI> de&s;erve it, who chu&s;e it; whom no Experience, no Con&s;ideration, no Miracles of Providence can engage to prefer their own Happine&s;s before their own De&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P>IT is owing (under GOD) to the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and the <HI>Hanover-Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kingdoms and Dominions have &s;een a Period of arbitrary Rule and Popi&s;h Madne&s;s. <HI>That</HI> Revolution and <HI>that</HI> Suc|ce&s;&s;ion have been the means of pre&s;erving the Reform'd Intere&s;t in <HI>Britain,</HI> and &s;ecuring the civil &amp; religious Liberties of the&s;e dependent Colonies. O! How can we reflect on it without the highe&s;t Plea&s;ure and Gratitude! Surely if we have any ju&s;t Notion of what Happine&s;s means; if any Feeling of the Happine&s;s, which in &s;uch plenty &s;urrounds us on all &s;ides; we mu&s;t be fill'd with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Joy &amp; Prai&s;e, when we reflect on tho&s;e Works of Wonder, in the accom|pli&s;hment whereof &s;uch an almo&s;t miraculous Hand of GOD appeared.</P>
<P>IF we &s;hould ca&s;t our Eyes back to the glorious <HI>Revolution</HI> under <HI>King</HI> WILLIAM'S happy Conduct, who has been well &s;tiled the <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> of his Day, for redeeming the Nation from Slavery, and the <HI>David</HI> of his Time, for fighting the Lord's Battles, and bearing up the Pillars of a di&s;&s;olving State: If we &s;hould take a View of that &s;tupendous Attempt, and con&s;ider how
<PB N="15" REF="002873_0021_0FE67FEDC6ADBB68">
it was begun and carried on, and what an <HI>unparallel'd Coincidence</HI> of de&s;irable Circum&s;tances there was, with|out which there had been no hope of Succe&s;s; this would lead us into a grateful Variety and a&s;toni&s;hing Scene of remarkable Events: Such as loudly proclaim to the World an interpo&s;ing Hand of Providence, guid|ing and influencing that great affair, from fir&s;t to la&s;t.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Con&s;equences of the Revolution, and what was nece&s;&s;ary to complete and e&s;tabli&s;h the Public Happine&s;s, was the fixing the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> to the Crown in the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Line. This happy Settlement was King WILLIAM'S &s;ublime Pro|jection; the grand care of his Life, and one of the noble&s;t Acts of his au&s;picious Reign. This was the mo&s;t effectual Security of the Prote&s;tant Religion, the Legal Toleration, and Liberty of Con&s;cience. With|out this, the Nation had probably ta&s;ted the &s;weet Fruits of the Revolution but for a very &s;hort Sea&s;on. Without this, in&s;olent Popery and arbitrary Govern|ment might long &s;ince have return'd, and laid us all in Chains again. But Thanks be to GOD, who put &s;uch an earne&s;t Care into the Heart of King WILLIAM for us, and who bow'd the Hearts of the Nobles and Parliaments of that day to come into his happy Tho't of the <HI>Hanover</HI>-Succe&s;&s;ion; to put the public Sanction upon it, and to confirm the Royal Decree by repeated Re&s;olutions, and concurring Votes of Lords and Com|mons from time to time. It's remarkable how all Factions and Denominations have at lea&s;t pretended to unite in this wi&s;e Expedient for the Nation's Safety. Several Parliaments of a different Complexion, and under the Influence of contrary Views and Principles, have centred in this De&s;ign, and openly declar'd for it. And all the Prote&s;tants in the Nation &s;wore to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, even before it took Place. Herein was <HI>the Finger of GOD!</HI></P>
<P>And then, WHEN it actually begun, in his late Maje&s;ty King GEORGE, there were bright appearances
<PB N="16" REF="002873_0022_0FE67FEDE4EB4758">
of a Divine Hand, in his coming to the Throne with &s;o many Circum&s;tances of Peace and Glory. Va&s;t had been the Hazards attending the Prote&s;tant Settle|ment of the Crown: Many a Cloud had hung over it: and for &s;everal years before it in fact took place, it was under a very threatning Cloud indeed, and &s;eem'd to be almo&s;t hopele&s;s and lo&s;t for ever. But all of a &s;udden there was an unexpected Turn of Affairs, and way made for the Prote&s;tant Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Throne, in the Per&s;on of glorious King GEORGE. Who&s;e Acce&s;&s;ion was at a Juncture and in a Manner, which had &s;uch &s;ignal Characters of a kind Providence interpo&s;ing (to re&s;cue a &s;inking Nation out of the hands of mercenary and faithle&s;s <HI>Statesmen,</HI> who had mi&s;erably betray'd their <HI>Queen</HI> and <HI>Country</HI>) that it's hardly po&s;&s;ible for any that ob&s;erv'd tho&s;e Signatures of a Divine Hand, ever to forget them. When it's con&s;ider'd how ripe things &s;eem'd at that day in favour of the Pretender; how many foreign Friends he had engag'd, and what numbers of powerful Adherents he had in the Kingdom; what a weak and disjointed &s;tate Things were in at home; how remote King GEORGE was from his <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When we reflect on the&s;e Circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd the Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion pa&s;t thro' a very dangerous Cri&s;is, and his late Maje&s;ty's peaceable Settlement on the Throne, gave a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing Deliverance to the Nation.</P>
<P>"IT was in an Extremity (&s;ays Bp. <HI>Burnet,</HI> who had as true an under&s;tanding in the Times, perhaps as any Man in his day) <Q>when the Be&s;t Men in the Nation were preparing them&s;elves for di&s;mal Events; having a Scene of Ruin and Confu&s;ion before them: But it plea&s;ed GOD to break the Cloud, and di&s;&s;ipate our Fears all at once. It was with a &s;udden Stroke that all the World was &s;urpri&s;ed:</Q> the plotting Enemies of the <HI>Hanover</HI>-Settlement thrown into great Confu&s;ion, their Coun&s;els all perplex'd, and they

Here was the over-ruling Hand of GOD <HI>the Judge,</HI> in confounding the de&s;igns of a di&s;affected Party, and bla&s;ting the Hopes of a Popi&s;h Pretender, when ju&s;t at the point of Accompli&s;hment. They were lifting up the Horn on high, and boa&s;ting with a &s;tiff Neck: while the Friends of the <HI>Legal</HI> Settlement were almo&s;t bro't to De&s;pair, and ready to give it up for lo&s;t. At &s;uch a Conjuncture it was, that GOD the Judge, appeared for his People's Relief; pleaded their Cau&s;e, and &s;catter'd the thick impending Cloud of Sor|rows near in View, by introducing the illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of HANOVER to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne. Then our Righteou&s;ne&s;s went forth as <HI>Brightne&s;s,</HI> and our Salvation as a <HI>Lamp that burneth.</HI> GOD our Judge gave us a King, who was as the <HI>Light of the Morn|ing,</HI> when the Sun ri&s;eth, even a Morning without Clouds. And all true Prote&s;tants, were ready to &s;a|lute KING <HI>GEORGE</HI> in the Language of <HI>Ama|&s;ai, Thine are we, and on thy &s;ide&punc; Peace, Peace be to thee; and Peace be to thy Helpers: for thy God helpeth thee.</HI></P>

<P>AND herein was the Favour of GOD to this <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> Royal Family.

<P>BUT I would con&s;ider the&s;e two Articles di&s;tinctly, according to the order wherein they lie in the Text. Wherefore in the next place,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> WE may be&s;tow a few Thoughts on that Pro|po&s;ition, <HI>He putteth down One.</HI></P>
<P>HERE we might premi&s;e this Remark, That there are frequent <HI>Depo&s;itions</HI> and Overturnings &s;een in the World. This is applicable both to <HI>Societies</HI> &amp; <HI>Per&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>WE often &s;ee <HI>Societies</HI> put down: Families, Towns, Provinces, Kingdoms &amp; Empires brought low, by un|happy Vici&s;&s;itudes. It is with political Bodies, as with Bodies natural: They are often out of order, and are &s;ometimes reduc'd to a very unhealthy Condition: labour of dangerous Di&s;tempers, and have Shame pour'd on all their Glory.</P>
<P>WE often &s;ee particular <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> put down. Some|times Men are reduc'd from a State of <HI>general Pro&s;|perity;</HI> depriv'd of their Riches, Plea&s;ures, Grandeurs; and &s;unk into a State of Affliction, Poverty, and Mean|ne&s;s. Riches take to them&s;elves wings, &amp; the Fa&s;hion of this World pa&s;&s;eth away. &mdash; Sometimes we &s;ee Men ca&s;t down from their <HI>Dignity</HI> in particular, and fall under public Di&s;grace: by the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Prince; by the Re&s;entments of the Populace; or by a &s;en&s;e of their own Villanies forcing them to &s;eek Ob|&s;curity. Thus we &s;ee &s;ome who once made a figure among our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> CHIEFS, now turn'd Renegades

and Fugitives with an abject <HI>Chevalier.</HI> &mdash; We &s;ee frequent Changes in the publick Mini&s;try of States and Kingdoms: And &s;ometimes even Crown'd Heads have been forc'd to &s;toop to their Rebel-Subjects, or have fallen before &s;ome powerful Invader. &mdash; So frail &amp; uncertain is all human Glory!</P>
<P>In fine, WE oftne&s;t of all &s;ee Men in Place and Power, put down by the undi&s;tingui&s;hing &s;troke of DEATH. The King of Terrors is the mightie&s;t Monarch in the World: bearing down before him all the Powers of the Earth. Both High &amp; Low fall Victims to his conquering Sword. We &s;ee that our titular <HI>Gods,</HI> how highly &s;oever exalted above their Brethren, are yet equally tributary to Death, and not exempted from paying the common Debt of Nature. They are called Gods; but <HI>die like Men.</HI> "They are Gods to us: but are Men to GOD". They have the &s;ame corruptible Nature, as other Men: and are under the &s;ame inflexible Sentence of Mor|tality. What's become of the <HI>Ce&s;ars</HI> and the <HI>Alex|anders,</HI> that once made &s;uch a Figure, and &s;uch a Noi&s;e in the World? They are long &s;ince put down by the powerful Hand of inexorable Death; put down in the Du&s;t; put down below all the Living. The mo&s;t potent Monarch has nothing to &s;ecure him from the fatal Stroke, any more than the feeble&s;t Pea&s;ant: And that brings them on a Level. He is liable to the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;es &amp; Di&s;a&s;ters. And neither his Earthly Riches, nor Civil Honours; nor yet his Moral Ex|cellencies, are any Protection to him. <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the Servant of the Lord, King in <HI>Je&s;hurun,</HI> as well as proud <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> his Enemy, King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> died at la&s;t. <HI>David,</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> a Man after GOD'S own Heart, as well as ungodly <HI>Saul,</HI> whom the Lord rejected, was dethron'd by the irre&s;i&s;tible Con|queror.&mdash; So, to give an In&s;tance fre&s;h in your Me|mories; That glorious Deliverer of the Nation, WILLIAM the Third, was put down by Death, as well as mi&s;erable <HI>James</HI> the Second. And now King GEORGE, that mo&s;t renowned Hero of the Age,

is dead, as well as an unhappy <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empre&s;s. &mdash; Their Breath was alike in their No&s;trils: It went forth, and they are fallen a common Prey to devour|ing Worms.</P>
<P>NOW what are the <HI>Le&s;&s;ons</HI> we are taught by the&s;e awakning Di&s;pen&s;ations?</P>
<P>WE are hereby taught the In&s;tability of the World; the Precariou&s;ne&s;s of every Condition; the Vanity of the mo&s;t pro&s;perous &amp; exalted Life; the Folly of putting our Confidence in the mo&s;t &s;ufficient and powerful Friends on Earth. <HI>Cea&s;e ye then from Man: for wherein is he to be accounted of!</HI>&mdash; Tru&s;t not in <HI>Princes:</HI> in whom we might tru&s;t, if in any among all Mankind; becau&s;e they have the greate&s;t Powers and mo&s;t exten&s;ive Advantages.

Let not your heart be envious, neither let it be afraid, when one is made rich, when the glory of his hou&s;e is increa&s;ed: for when he dieth, <HI>his Glory &s;hall not de&s;cend after him</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 49.16, 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN a word, LET us receive Conviction of our own <HI>Mortality,</HI> and be put upon diligent <HI>Preparation</HI> for a dying hour, which is ha&s;tning upon us all. If Death conquers KINGS, be&s;ure meaner Men may expect to find no Di&s;charge in this War. The Decea&s;e of our late Monarch is a loud warning to his whole Kingdom and Dominions; as much as the Death of a Father to all his Hou&s;e. The Death even of any common Per|&s;on,

how ob&s;cure &amp; minute &s;oever, carries in it matter of impre&s;&s;ive Ob&s;ervation, &amp; calls us to &s;erious Reflecti|ons: Much more the Fall of great Men, Rulers and Princes; in which, as the Stroke is heavier, &s;o the Voice louder, and both more exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE Death of a <HI>King</HI> calls aloud to the <HI>Kings</HI> of the Earth, e&s;pecially to the next in Succe&s;&s;ion to him, to con&s;ider their End, &amp; reign as dying Creatures.</P>
<P>THE Death of a KING is in particular a &s;olemn Peal rung in the Ears of all &s;ubordinate Governours and Magi&s;trates in his Kingdoms &amp; Dominions. The general Vacation of Commi&s;&s;ions by his Demi&s;e, &s;hou'd put them upon preparing to be finally turn'd out of place <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Day of Death is by the <HI>Latins</HI> call'd, <HI>Dies depo|&s;itionis.</HI></NOTE> by their own Death, which will &s;oon follow.

<P>MAY we all be made more mindful of our approch|ing End. The Language of Providence to us is that, <HI>Be ye ready; for ye know not the day nor the hour. Watch, le&s;t your Lord coming &s;uddenly, &s;hou'd find you &s;leeping.</HI> &mdash; His late Maje&s;ty's Death <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The public Prints tell us,</HI> That the KING died of an Apoplectic Fit, in his Travels abroad; being on his Journey to <HI>Hanover,</HI> and having ju&s;t reach'd <HI>O&s;enburg;</HI> at the Palace of his Brother, the Duke of <HI>York, June</HI> 11.</NOTE> was by a &s;udden

O let us hereby be rouz'd out of that Security we are &s;o incident to, and be excited to ha&s;ten our Preparations for Eternity; as not knowing how &s;oon we may be call'd off the pre&s;ent Stage.</P>
<P>BUT I come now,</P>
<P>TO ob&s;erve, That GOD is the <HI>Author</HI> of all the&s;e Changes &amp; Revolutions. GOD is the Judge: <HI>HE putteth down.</HI></P>
<P>IN whatever Sen&s;e any are put down, it is by the &s;overeign Hand of GOD. If Men be turn'd out of their worldly Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, it is GOD that impoveri&s;hes them; whether it be done by tho&s;e Ca&s;ualties that are more immediately at the di&s;po&s;e of Divine Providence, or by the Interpo&s;ition of humane In&s;truments. &mdash; So if any be turn'd out of their Po&s;ts of Honour, it is GOD that di&s;places them. Even tho&s;e Di&s;graces, which come upon the Innocent, thro' the Envy &amp; Malice of under|mining Rivals, are by the Permi&s;&s;ion of GOD. Has it not been known in &s;ome Reigns, that the mo&s;t faithful Mini&s;ters of State, and mo&s;t victorious Generals have been di&s;carded, &amp; very unaccountable alterations made; without any other Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign'd but what is as bad as none, <HI>viz. mere Will and Plea&s;ure!</HI> And how often have Men been run down &amp; ruin'd by mere dint of <HI>Slander!</HI> Yet in all this we mu&s;t look above In|&s;truments; as devout <HI>David,</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>The Lord hath bid</HI> Shimei: <HI>to cur&s;e me.</HI> &mdash; But the Divine Agency is more e&s;pecially &s;een in tho&s;e Di&s;graces, that fall upon the Guilty, and are de&s;erv'd; which very often happens. Particularly, there are many times &s;trange <HI>Retributions</HI> in the Turns of Providence: as when wicked <HI>Haman</HI> was him&s;elf hang'd on the very Gal|lows he had newly erected for loyal &amp; pious <HI>Mordecai.</HI> GOD pre&s;erveth the Faithful, and <HI>plentifully re|wardeth the proud Doer.</HI> When we &s;ee tho&s;e Men degraded, that were in&s;trumental in the &s;upplanting and over&s;etting of others, and triumph'd in it: When we &s;ee Men &s;tript of their E&s;tates &amp; Honours, and
<PB N="24" REF="002873_0030_0FE6800047A922C8">
bani&s;hed their native Country, who had plotted to take away the Sub&s;i&s;tence of others, and rob them of the very Rights of Nature, and Privileges of Eng|li&s;h-men: So when we &s;ee <HI>Them</HI> attainted of Trea|&s;on, or puni&s;h'd for Rebellion, who have &s;ignalis'd their Fury again&s;t Tho&s;e that are <HI>quiet in the Land,</HI> under Colour of their being Men of dangerous Prin|ciples and &s;editious Practices: &mdash; What can we &s;ay in all &s;uch Ca&s;es? Who knoweth not in all the&s;e, that <HI>the hand of the Lord</HI> hath wrought this? GOD is many times known by the Judgments, which He executeth. Have we not in our day &s;een the fulfil|ment of tho&s;e Scriptures? &mdash; <HI>He taketh the wi&s;e in their own Craftine&s;s: and &s;aveth the Poor from the Sword, from the Mouth, and from the Hand of the Mighty.</HI> Lo! <HI>The Deceived and the Deceiver are His. He leadeth Coun&s;ellers away &s;poiled: He poureth Contempt on Princes: He overthroweth the Chief of the People, and cau&s;eth them to wander in</HI> Exile.</P>
<P>HAVE we not &s;een a Divine Hand remarkably put|ting down the <HI>Enemies</HI> of King GEORGE! Setting a&s;ide an abjur'd Pretender; taking off certain Poten|tates, his powerful Friends, at the critical Junctures; and fru&s;trating his infatuated Votaries, by a Series of won|derful Providences! The Trumpet of Sedition has been almo&s;t ever &s;ounding; and dangerous Plots &s;o frequently repeated, that they may be call'd one con|tinu'd Con&s;piracy. But the Lord pour'd Contempt on their Coun&s;els, and di&s;graced all their Mea&s;ures. We have &s;een an invading <HI>Sennacherib,</HI> with a Hook in his No&s;e, and a Bridle in his Lips, turn'd back by the way which he came. GOD &s;hewed Mercy to his <HI>Anointed,</HI> and &s;ubdued the People under Him. <HI>He bound the Floods from over-flowing: and the Thing that was hid, brought he forth to Light. He hath de&s;troyed the wi&s;dom of the Wi&s;e, and &s;cattered tho Proud in the Imagination of their Hearts.</HI> They are brought down, and fallen: but we are ri&s;en and &s;tand upright.&mdash; <HI>Unto Thee, O</HI> LORD <HI>do we give Thanks:</HI> for that thy Name is near; thy wondrous
<PB N="25" REF="002873_0031_0FE68001A0A0C0B0">
Works declare. If it had not been the LORD, who was on our &s;ide, may I&s;rael now &s;ay: If it had not been the LORD who was on our &s;ide; the Waters had overwhelmed us, the proud Waters had gone over our Soul. But our Soul is e&s;caped as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowlers. Ble&s;&s;ed be the LORD, who hath not given us a Prey to their Teeth. We have &s;een very bright Di&s;plays of a divine Hand, putting down Tho&s;e that have exalted them&s;elves, to imagin a mi&s;chievous Device; almo&s;t as &s;en&s;ible as when they fought from Heaven, the Stars in their Cour&s;es, again&s;t <HI>Si&s;era.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I pa&s;s now to hint,</P>
<P>WHEN any are removed by <HI>Death,</HI> and laid in the Du&s;t, it is GOD that puts them down.</P>
<P>GOD is the &s;overeign Di&s;po&s;er of the Lives of Men. Even the Princes of the World &s;ub&s;i&s;t by his Power and Mercy. So it was &s;aid to King <HI>Nebuchadnezzar, The God in who&s;e hand thy Breath is, and who&s;e are all thy ways</HI> &mdash;. He takes away their Breath when He plea&s;es, and &s;o takes their Crown from them.</P>
<P>HENCE then we may learn,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, WHOM to <HI>fear;</HI> not <HI>Man</HI> but <HI>GOD.</HI> If GOD be for us, we may boldly &s;ay, The LORD is my Helper; I will not fear what Man can do unto me, or the Son of Man, who is a worm. But fear GOD, who has thy Life in his Hand; and becau&s;e there is Wrath, beware le&s;t He take thee away with his Stroke: then a great Ran&s;om cannot deliver thee.</P>
<P>Again, WE learn Whom to put our <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> in; not <HI>Man</HI> but <HI>GOD.</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t wi&s;ely concludes, <HI>It is better to tru&s;t in the Lord,</HI> than to put Confidence in Princes. O <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> tru&s;t thou in the <HI>Lord:</HI> He is your Help, and your Shield. Some boa&s;t them&s;elves in the Multitude of their Riches; &s;ome in Chariots, and &s;ome in Hor&s;es: But we will remember the Name of the Lord our GOD. We will tru&s;t in Him to &s;ave his People, and to pre&s;erve his Anointed: to e&s;tabli&s;h the Throne of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in the pre&s;ent Royal
<PB N="26" REF="002873_0032_0FE645F40A3BB870">
Family, again&s;t all the Claims &amp; Attempts of a Pre|tended <HI>Heir;</HI> to turn the Coun&s;el of <HI>Ahitophel</HI> into Fooli&s;hne&s;s, and pre&s;erve the Lamp that GOD hath pre|pared, for a Light to his People <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word, WHAT has been &s;aid, directs us to <HI>eye the Hand</HI> of GOD in the Revolutions we expe|rience or ob&s;erve. In all Changes whether per&s;o|nal, dome&s;tic, or public, we mu&s;t reali&s;e a Divine Agency. Under all Cro&s;&s;es, Bereavements, Nece&s;&s;i|ties, Reproches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we mu&s;t look at the hand of GOD &s;tretched out, and inquire wherefore GOD is contending with us. We mu&s;t humble our &s;elves in the &s;ight of GOD, under the Calamities that befal our Country or Nation.</P>
<P>Particularly, AT this day, we are call'd to con&s;ider GOD as the Judge, who <HI>putteth down</HI> KINGS: and &s;hou'd lay to heart the awful Stroke of his hand in removing our late glorious MONARCH from our Head.</P>
<P>KING <HI>GEORGE</HI> &s;eem'd to be form'd for the Happine&s;s of Mankind: rais'd up by a kind Provi|dence, to be the common Protector of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Guardian of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> and the Defence of <HI>Britain.</HI> Therefore his Royal Per&s;on was under a con&s;tant peculiar Tutelage of Heaven, and appear'd the vi&s;ible Favorite of Providence. He was in Labours and Fatigues more abundant; in Journeying oft, in Perils many, in Perils by Sea &amp; Land, in Perils among <HI>fal&s;e Brethren,</HI> in Perils by &s;ecret Traitors, and open Enemies &mdash;. But GOD covered his Head; pre&s;erv'd his precious Life, and made his Glory great in his Sal|vation. He deliver'd Him not up to the Will of his Enemies, to them who breath'd out Cruelty and Slaughter.&mdash; But now alas! He hath given Him over to <HI>Death,</HI> and to the power of the Grave.</P>
<P>HOW hath the LORD covered <HI>Zion</HI> with a Cloud, and ca&s;t down to the Earth <HI>the Beauty of</HI> I&s;rael, the <HI>Breath of our No&s;trils.</HI> The World has lo&s;t one of it's

Behold, the LORD, the LORD of Ho&s;ts taketh away from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> the <HI>Stay</HI> and the <HI>Staff,</HI> the <HI>mighty Man,</HI> and the <HI>Man of War,</HI> the <HI>Judge,</HI> and the <HI>Prudent,</HI> and the <HI>An|cient</HI> &mdash;. O let us mourn the public Lo&s;s: and humble our &s;elves under the mighty Hand of GOD. Surely it is a Di&s;pen&s;ation that challenges an eminent <HI>A&s;teri&s;m</HI> to be put upon it; peculiar Notice to be taken of it; and calls for all proper Expre&s;&s;ions of a deep Regret &amp; Sorrow.</P>
<P>YET while we are mourning the common Bereave|ment, we may not pa&s;s over tho&s;e alleviating Con&s;ide|rations, that pre&s;ent them&s;elves to refre&s;h our Sorrows.</P>
<P>LET us then with Thankfulne&s;s to GOD, review the bright Train of <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings,</HI> that fill'd &amp; adorn'd King GEORGE'S Happy Reign: admire the many &s;hining Beauties in his Regal Character, and pre&s;erve a fre&s;h Idea of his excellent Admini&s;tration, which has been as it were one continu'd Scene of Glory: wherein we beheld a lively Copy of the Legal Con&s;titution; accord|ing to which the Crown has "many Prerogatives to protect us &amp; do us Good, but none to invade our Li|berty or Property." We &s;aw an uncommon In&s;tance of <HI>Princely Greatne&s;s:</HI> the height of Royal Maje&s;ty, and the depth of humble Indulgence, in a happy Con|junction: An intrepid Bravery of Mind, and the Soft|ne&s;s of human Pa&s;&s;ions, met together: which is ob|&s;erv'd to make the mo&s;t perfect compo&s;ition of a hap|py Prince.

We &s;aw a very glorious Example of Truth &amp; Firmne&s;s to <HI>Alliances.</HI> We &s;aw a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> KING apply'd to, as the common <HI>Arbitrator</HI> between contending Powers, and the grand Security of public Treaties: extending his hap|py Influence thro' all <HI>Europe,</HI> to give Life &amp; Vi|gour to the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, and &s;ecure the la&s;ting Happine&s;s of his own Dominions. We &s;aw a Prince as <HI>clement</HI> at home, as he was terrible abroad: as <HI>Meek</HI> under In&s;ults, as fearle&s;s of Enemies: as <HI>graci|ous</HI> on the Throne, as he was couragious in the Field, and powerful on the Seas. We can never enough ad|mire the incomparable Temper &amp; Mildne&s;s of his Go|vernment; the un&s;potted <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of his Admini&s;tra|tion; his happy Judgment and Knowlege of the true Intere&s;ts of the Public; the profound <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of his univer&s;al Conduct; the inflexible <HI>Con&s;tancy</HI> of his well concerted Re&s;olutions; the <HI>Magnanimity</HI> of his Attempts for the publick Good; the admirable <HI>Di&s;|patch</HI> of Affairs; the <HI>&s;teady</HI> indefatigable Attention to the public Helm; the <HI>Munificence</HI> of his Royal Hand on many occa&s;ions; the indelible Sen&s;e of real Merit in his Servants, and the Fidelity of his Friends &mdash;. But I forbear. 'Tis far from me to pretend to give his MAJESTY'S <HI>Character,</HI> or an Ac|count of his Admini&s;tration. One may as well at|tempt to celebrate <HI>Light</HI> &amp; <HI>Health;</HI> Ble&s;&s;ings to be rather felt than de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e things, He has very much retriev'd the Glory of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, and promoted the pub|lick Happine&s;s. &mdash; For the&s;e things, let the Name of KING <HI>GEORGE the Fir&s;t,</HI> live immortal, and &s;hine in the Rolls of Fame, thro' the Series of all Po&s;|terities, with a never-fading Lu&s;tre. &mdash; And for the&s;e things, let us give Thanks to GOD, <HI>the Fa|ther of Lights, from whom comes down every good and perfect Gift.</HI> We &s;hou'd entertain our &s;elves with &s;uch Reflections as the&s;e, while we are mourning the public Lo&s;s. 'Tis a ju&s;t Tribute to the Memory of
<PB N="29" REF="002873_0035_0FE68003AB939FD8">
the KING, and a proper Expre&s;&s;ion (as well as Mo|tive) of Gratitude to GOD, who bro't Him to the Throne, and made him &s;uch an exten&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing. Tho' we are in Tears for his Removal: yet we &s;hould be <HI>glad of heart for all the Goodne&s;s of the</HI> LORD <HI>to his Servant</HI> David, <HI>and which He hath done for his People</HI> I&s;rael.</P>
<P>Moreover, LET us reflect with a particular Sen&s;e of the favour of Heaven, on the <HI>Manner</HI> in which the KING has been put down. That he was not depos'd by the hand of his <HI>Adver&s;aries:</HI> not put down by a trea&s;onable <HI>Deprivation;</HI> nor by execrable <HI>Parricide;</HI> nor did he fall in <HI>Battel:</HI> but by the power of Di&s;ea&s;e, he died a <HI>natural</HI> Death, and <HI>went the way of all the Earth.</HI> The Crown is fallen from his Head: but not plucked thence by human Power; which might have provok'd the loud Triumphs &amp; In&s;ultings of his envi|ous Enemies, which are al&s;o ours. The Sceptre <HI>dropt</HI> out of his royal Hand: not wre&s;ted away by the Sons of Violence. He was not forc'd out of the Throne by an <HI>untimely End,</HI> as ONE of his Predece&s;|&s;ors: nor did he peri&s;h in an inglorious <HI>Exile,</HI> as AN|OTHER: nor did he as Others of Them, after &s;ome gloomy years of unhappy Management, depart <HI>with|out De&s;ire,</HI> like <HI>Jehoram.</HI> But King GEORGE died in the Bed of <HI>Honour,</HI> in the mid&s;t of univer&s;al ap|plau&s;e &amp; Renown, in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Throne, &amp; of his People's loyal Hearts; and in the pro&s;pect of increa&s;ing Glory: in the 13th year of his Reign, and 68th of his Age: full of Days, and full of Pro&s;perity, Wealth and Grandeur.</P>
<P>Finally, WE may note the <HI>Time</HI> when He was put down, &amp; the happy Po&s;ture he left Things in. We have Rea&s;on to be thankful to GOD for continuing his Ser|vant &s;o long a public Good. &mdash; We have cau&s;e to be thankful, that altho' he was taken off at a critical Juncture, when the Eyes of all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were upon him, waiting the I&s;&s;ue of his prudent Coun&s;els: yet it was <HI>after</HI> Affairs abroad had taken a <HI>favourable</HI> Turn, by
<PB N="30" REF="002873_0036_0FE6800572522FD8">
the powerful Influence of his Care &amp; Conduct. Had he died but a few Months or Weeks &s;ooner, in all pro|bability, there had been a darker Scene before us than at pre&s;ent appears. Let us ble&s;s GOD, who orders the Times &amp; Sea&s;ons, that the KING liv'd to &s;ee his wi&s;e Mea&s;ures for re&s;toring the publick Tranquillity, &s;o far obtain their Accompli&s;hment, as to afford &s;ome Pro&s;|pect of a general Pacification.</P>
<P>LET us be thankful, that Things at Home were left under &s;o many Guards; and all the Barriers of our civil &amp; religious Liberties, in full force &amp; &s;ecure.</P>
<P>LET us be thankful, that GOD hath given his Ser|vant a Royal HEIR and <HI>Succe&s;&s;or,</HI> who we hope will improve the Felicities we are left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and complete the excellent De&s;igns his Royal Father died in the pro&s;perous Pur&s;uit of. As <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> dy'd in the Wilderne&s;s, before he had perfected the work of <HI>I&s;rael's</HI> Redemption: but left a <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to carry on and fini&s;h that glorious Enterprize. So his late Maje&s;ty was taken off by a &s;udden Stroke, and left unfini&s;h'd the happy Mea&s;ures he had enter'd into, for the Tranquillity of <HI>Europe,</HI> and Pro&s;perity of his <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions: yet ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, we have Rea&s;on to hope that his Tho'ts will not &s;o peri&s;h with him, but that the admirable Schemes he hath projected, will be pur&s;u'd by his Illu&s;trious SUCCESSOR, for pre&s;erving the Balance of <HI>Europe.</HI> If one of the Admirers of King GEORGE the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> (and who among us doth not profe&s;s him&s;elf to be of that number) &s;hould put <HI>Solomon's</HI> Que&s;tion, <HI>What can the Man do that comes after the King?</HI> It is an&s;wered, We hope King GEORGE the <HI>Second</HI> will not only do <HI>that which hath been done already,</HI> but even <HI>greater Works.</HI> The Pro&s;pect of HIS Succeeding to the Crown, was no &s;mall Plea&s;ure to his Royal FATHER, and to the Nation. We hear King <HI>David</HI> on his Death-bed expre&s;&s;ing a mighty Satisfaction, at the Thought of <HI>Solomon's</HI> being his Succe&s;&s;or in the Throne, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 1.48. Thus &s;aid the King, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>which hath given One to

&s;it on my Throne this day mine Eye even &s;eeing it!</HI> A like Satisfaction our late KING expre&s;s'd, in one of his mo&s;t gracious Speeches to the Parliament:
<Q>It is <HI>My</HI> HAPPINESS (and I am confident you think it yours) to &s;ee a PRINCE of <HI>Wales,</HI> who may in due time &s;ucceed me on the Throne; and to &s;ee Him ble&s;&s;ed with many Children; the be&s;t and mo&s;t va|luable Pledges of our Care and Concern for your Pro&s;perity.</Q>
&mdash; And as when <HI>David</HI> declared <HI>So|lomon</HI> his <HI>Heir,</HI> to be King in his &s;tead, One an&s;wered the King, and &s;aid, AMEN! <HI>The Lord God of my Lord the King &s;ay &s;o too</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 1.36.</NOTE>.

<P>AND now by the Mercy of the mo&s;t HIGH, we &s;ee an happy <HI>An&s;wer</HI> of that Prayer: which gives a ju&s;t Allay to our pre&s;ent Grief, enlivens our Joy, and rai&s;es up all our Hopes.

<P>AND here, I did de&s;ign at fir&s;t to re&s;erve Room for &s;ome Enlargements; but find I &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s on your Patience, if I do any more than give the following Hints.</P>
<P>THE <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> attributes both Acts to the &s;ame Di|vine Hand: He that putteth down One, <HI>&s;etteth up another.</HI></P>
<P>IT is GOD that exalts Men in the World. <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> in general, is from his bountiful Providence. And in particular <HI>Promotion</HI> to places of Power &amp; Dignity is from GOD. <HI>Both Riches and Honour come of Him:
<PB N="32" REF="002873_0038_0FE6800A6D861938">
In his hand it is to make Great.</HI> It is GOD that fur|ni&s;hes Men for publick Stations; forms their Genius and Temper, according to the Variety of Employments; calls them forth to actual Service, and by his over-ruling hand &s;upplies all manner of Po&s;ts &amp; Offices, whether hereditary, or commi&s;&s;ionary &amp; elective.</P>
<P>GOD is the Founder &amp; Upholder of States and Kingdoms. <HI>The Pillars of the Earth are the Lord's; and He hath &s;et the World upon them.</HI> His Provi|dence governs in modelling the various Con&s;titutions: and in all the Preferments of Per&s;ons from time to time. <HI>Monarchy</HI> is a lawful form of Government; approved of GOD. <HI>He</HI> (&s;ays the Prophet) <HI>&s;etteth up</HI> KINGS.

<P>AND we have much more Occa&s;ion to rejoyce in the Goodne&s;s of GOD, when He commits the Admi|ni&s;tration of Government into <HI>able</HI> &amp; <HI>faithful</HI> Hands.

<P>AND let us <HI>continue</HI> in Prayer for his Maje&s;ty; the Security of his Per&s;on, and Pro&s;perity of his Reign.

And as the KING <HI>him&s;elf is &s;erv'd by the Profits of the Field:</HI> &s;o may He by the Devotions of the Clo&s;et.

<Q>A Crown (&s;ays one) is a very glittering Thing, and apt to dazzle the Eyes of Tho&s;e who wear it; &s;o that they cannot &s;ee &s;o well, either their own Imperfections, or the Treachery &amp; Flattery of their Attendents: Among&s;t whom, there are u&s;ually but Few, &s;o bravely Vir|tuous, as to dare tell them the <HI>Truth.</HI></Q>

<P>THE Language of Providence to us at this day, is that (<HI>Ezra</HI> 6.10.) <HI>Pray to the God of Heaven, for the Life of the King, and of his Sons.</HI> We &s;ee the Throne now, by the Favour of GOD, incircl'd with Happine&s;s.

The words of <HI>Samuel</HI> come to my Tho'ts on this Occa&s;ion,&mdash; <HI>Upon Whom is the</HI> DESIRE <HI>of all</HI> I&s;rael? <HI>Is it not on Thee, and on all thy Father's Hou&s;e?</HI> And we are entertaining our &s;elves with the plea&s;ing Tho'ts, that as Hereditary, and Parlementary Right are now one, &s;o they &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;h'd in this happy Union; and the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion be dif|fus'd among us for Ages to come. But we mu&s;t not confide too &s;trongly in human Probabilities. GOD can ea&s;ily dry up our Springs, and de&s;troy our Hopes, by laying de&s;olate our Royal Tribe. <HI>Gideon</HI> left no le&s;s than <HI>Seventy</HI> Sons when he died; and yet in a &s;hort time they were cut off by a murderous Hand. <HI>Ahab</HI> left the like Number, and they were all beheaded in one day. Other In&s;tances we find in Hi&s;tory, of &s;uch bloody Ma&s;&s;acres, and De&s;truction of the Seed Royal. Hence whatever hopeful Pro&s;pects we have before us; yet there's no dependence, but upon GOD, who&s;e Pre|rogative it is to kill &amp; to &s;ave alive to put down, and to &s;et up. Let us then be commending the Kingly Fa|mily of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to the &s;pecial Care &amp; Benedic|tion of Divine Providence; making mention of Them always in our Prayers.</P>
<P>IT is a worthy Subject of Prayer. From this happy Nur&s;ery alone it is that we can rationally expect any Plants of Renown. Shou'd this Royal Line fail; Or
