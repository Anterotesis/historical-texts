<P>Knowing therefore the Terror of the LORD we per&s;wade Men.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_MY Fathers and Brethren, the governing Pa&s;&s;ions of the human Soul, which are indeed the great Sources of Action, are <HI>love</HI> and <HI>fear.</HI> Now the Religion of JESUS contains Arguments no|bly adapted to influence both, which is indeed its peculiar Glory. Here are the mo&s;t power|ful attractives to allure our <HI>love</HI> and &s;trike our <HI>ingenuity</HI> that ever were pre&s;ented to the human Mind. I mean redeeming Love and Goodne&s;s, the a&s;toni&s;hing conde&s;cention of God him&s;elf in a&s;&s;uming our Nature, under the ruinous Circum&s;tances con&s;equent to our Apo&s;tacy, and therein enduring voluntarily and patiently, in his Name, Body and Soul, all that Contempt and Mi&s;ery which our Sins demerited, in order to reconcile us to GOD, and &s;ave us from Wrath and Ruin. O matchle&s;s Mercy! O amazing Goodne&s;s! O the intollerable, incomprehen&s;ible and inxpre&s;&s;ible Agonies and Pains our dear dear, Lord endured! One would think that the mentioning of this <HI>Love</HI> alone, was &s;ufficient to con&s;train Mankind to follow the <HI>Redeemer</HI>'s Standard, and to <HI>dare</HI> to be Holy. But &s;ad Experience proves the Contrary. Degenerate Mankind, while under the Dominion of Sin, are almo&s;t wholly lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of Ingenuity and Gratitude. Nothing truly Great and Noble has the habitual a&s;cendant in them. No! Immoderate Self-love is the &s;ecret Spring of all their Motions, and therefore it's nece&s;|&s;ary to alarm tho&s;e <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Souls out of their fatal Security and In|dolence, by Arguments of <HI>Terror,</HI> that hereby they may be brought to a &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of their Danger, and con&s;equently con&s;trained to the earne&s;t U&s;e of Means to obtain an e&s;cape.</P>
<P>THIS the primitive Mini&s;ters of CHRIST were well aware of, as the Text I have cho&s;en to di&s;cour&s;e upon informs us. They having had the Experience of the <HI>Terrors</HI> of God upon their own Minds, before their clo&s;ure with JESUS, and having known their Nece&s;&s;ity, Influence and U&s;e, did labour by the &s;ame Arguments to per|&s;wade others to be Holy, <HI>Knowing the Terrors of the LORD we per&s;wade Men.</HI></P>
<P>AND methinks among all the Arguments of <HI>Terror</HI> gra&s;p'd in the &s;acred Volumn, none is more affecting and awful than that of the <HI>General Judgment,</HI> and this is what our Text refers to, and is therefore the Subject of our pre&s;ent Meditations.</P>
<P>THE <HI>General Judgment,</HI> my Brethren, is one of the mo&s;t grand
<PB N="4" REF="006427_0003_1028E4EFF1A405E8">
and important Events that comes within the Compa&s;s of human Knowledge; the Con&s;ideration whereof &s;hould &s;ummons all our Powers to the mo&s;t reverend and deep Attention.</P>
<P>THAT there is a JUDGMENT to come, appears from the na|tural Subordination of Man to God, as a Creature to his Creator, a Subject to his Prince, and a Servant to his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>FROM this <HI>Subordination,</HI> corre&s;pondent Obligations do re&s;ult; for the Neglect or Performance of which, it is but rea&s;onable they &s;hould Account, and receive <HI>Rewards</HI> accordingly, otherwi&s;e the afore&s;aid Relations and Obligations would be vain and to no Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE are likewi&s;e natural Relations among Men, and Tran&s;|actions which give ground to &s;everal Duties of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Huma|nity,</HI> by the neglect of which others may &s;uffer great Injury, of which they can &s;ometimes get no redre&s;s. Is it not then mo&s;t ju&s;t and rea&s;onable that &s;uch Ca&s;es &s;hould be referred to the common Patron of RIGHT, in order to be &s;uitably rewarded? This was the Apo&s;tle's Judgment in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> he a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>that it is a righteous Thing with God, to recompence Tribulation to tho&s;e that trouble his People, and to them who are troubled re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>AND are there not many &s;ecret good and bad Di&s;po&s;itions, which are not nor cannot be here awarded? Then is it not rea&s;onable that there &s;hould be a Time when both &s;hall be di&s;clo&s;ed and obtain an an&s;werable recompence?</P>
<P>THERE have been, and no doubt are in the World, &s;uch Per&s;ons who commit great Injuries, and yet no Ju&s;tice can be got of them, either becau&s;e of their Policy, their Power, or Authority: Is it not nece&s;&s;ary therefore that there &s;hould be a &s;upreme Tri|bunal, before which &s;uch grand, in&s;olent and ungovernable Cri|minals &s;hould be arraigned? Not to &s;ay that Con&s;cience accu&s;es for the mo&s;t &s;ecret Crimes, and pre&s;ages a Judgment to come; yea the common Sen&s;e of Mankind dictates the rea&s;onablene&s;s of Pu|ni&s;hment to the Guilty. Does not every Per&s;on when he &s;ees ano|ther guilty of gro&s;s Crimes, judge it unfit that he &s;hould e&s;cape with Impunity? And will not the Mind be grated with In|dignation or Grief by beholding the Inocent and Beneficent Suf|fering?</P>
<P>IS not a <HI>future Judgment,</HI> my Brethren, when eternal Rewards &s;hall be di&s;pen&s;ed, needful to excite Men to Vertue and Goodne&s;s, and to re&s;train them from Vice? Certainly Men are by Nature prone to a pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ible Good, which the fears of a greater E|vil, and the Hopes of a greater Good, are nece&s;&s;ary to turn them from.</P>
<P>FEAR and <HI>Hope</HI> are doubtle&s;s the main <HI>Springs</HI> which turn the Wheels of human Action. Now this life &s;carcely affords Rewards which overpoize the Difficulties that attend Piety and Vertue; nei|ther can human Laws extend to all Actions, and hence, as the A|po&s;tle ob&s;erves, <HI>if in this Life only we have Hope, we are of all Men the mo&s;t mi&s;erable.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006427_0003_1028E4EFF1A405E8">AGAIN, Human Society mu&s;t disband without a <HI>Judgment</HI> to come: For how can that &s;ub&s;i&s;t without <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> and can the&s;e be expected without Con&s;cience, and can that do its Office without <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> without a regard to a future reckoning?</P>
<P>IF you enquire concerning the <HI>Judge,</HI> I an&s;wer, the ab&s;olute Power of judging, in&s;eparably belongs to God the Father, he being our Creator, to his Judgment we &s;tand obnoxious. But the <HI>exer|ci&s;e</HI> of this <HI>judicial</HI> Authority, is, for wi&s;e Purpo&s;es, committed to the Son.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary that the Judge &s;hould be vi&s;ible, in order to the clearer Conviction and more ample Satisfaction of the Parties con|cerned.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Judgment</HI> is a Branch of CHRIST'S <HI>Kingly Office,</HI> which the Father conferred upon him as a Reward of his mediatorial aba&s;ure. Indeed it is an Office of two great emi|nence to be conferred upon any other, to determine the final States of intelligent Beings; the <HI>Lamb is only worthy to take the Book of Judgment and open the Seals thereof, becau&s;e he hath redeemed us to God by his Blood.</HI> It is he alone who hath a Capacity for this Province, becau&s;e of his Omni&s;cience, Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>AND &s;urely, <HI>Sirs,</HI> it is but right that the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould be ve&s;ted with a Power to reward his Friends, and cru&s;h his inveterate Enemies, that &s;o the apparent di&s;honours of his Cro&s;s may be forever rol'd away.</P>
<P>FARTHER, the Glories of God's Wi&s;dom and Love, are di&s;|play'd in appointing &s;o well qualified a Per&s;on, &s;o meek, &s;o loving, &s;o merciful a Judge. Not to &s;ay, that this appointment likewi&s;e &s;erves to beget in us, a Reverence of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> an Ob&s;ervance of his Laws, and an Imitation of his Example.</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>Manner</HI> of the judicial Proce&s;s, the &s;acred Scriptures give us the following account hereof, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Time is ap|pointed for it, which is called <HI>a Day.</HI></P>
<P>THAT God hath regi&s;tered Men's Actions in the Book of his Omni&s;cience in order to it.</P>
<P>THAT for this End, a Re&s;urrection of the Ju&s;t and Unju&s;t &s;hall be effected by Almighty Power.</P>
<P>THAT then all Per&s;ons rai&s;ed, &s;hall be pre&s;ented before the Bar of God; <HI>I &s;aw,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle <HI>John, the Dead, &s;mall and great, &s;tand before God,</HI></P>
<P>THAT every Thought, Word and Action &s;hall be examined, <HI>God will bring to light the hidden Things of Darkne&s;s, and make manife&s;t the Coun&s;els of all Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>THAT after this, a definitive Sentence &s;hall pa&s;s agreeable to Mans Actions, which &s;hall be accordingly executed.</P>
<P>THAT all Things &s;hall be tran&s;acted in a fair and regular Manner, to the Conviction of all pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>NOW, my dear and reverend Brethren, methinks the Con&s;ide|ration of what has been &s;aid, &s;hould excite us, who bear the Mini|&s;terial
<PB N="6" REF="006427_0004_1028E4F180BFE118">
Character, unweariedly to endeavour <HI>(pro viribus)</HI> to <HI>alarm</HI> and <HI>per&s;wade</HI> a &s;ecure and ob&s;tinate World, by <HI>the Terrors of the LORD,</HI> after the Apo&s;tolical Pre&s;ident in our Text, whatever <HI>An|tinomians</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> mutter to the Contrary, <HI>&s;eeing that the whole need no Phy&s;ician, but the &s;ick.</HI> Let us urge Sinners with the utmo&s;t Importunity and mo&s;t &s;olemn <HI>Pathos,</HI> to repent and believe the Go&s;pel; to fly from the Wrath to come to the great <HI>Redeemer</HI> for Shelter and Salvation.</P>
<P>AND &s;hould not the Thoughts of the &s;olemn judicial Scene be|fore us, excite all, both Mini&s;ters and People to watchfulne&s;s and &s;obriety, <HI>for we know not when the Son of Man cometh, at Mid|night, Cock-crowing, or in the Morning.</HI></P>
<P>NOR &s;hould we be thereby le&s;s induced to <HI>&s;incerity</HI> and <HI>candor</HI> in our whole behaviour, and to the &s;erious &s;teady Performance of the &s;ecret Duties of Religion; which will be then openly and honourably mentioned, and graciou&s;ly, but plentifully, Rewarded. O, Sirs! let us endeavour to have the Te&s;timony of our Con|&s;ciences in our favour, that <HI>in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, not with fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Conver&s;ation in the World.</HI> O let us improve our <HI>Talents,</HI> for we are but Stewards, and mu&s;t quickly give Account of our Steward&s;hip. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>My Reverend Brethren, in order to improve to Purpo&s;e, the Talents which a gracious God has given us, is it not nece&s;&s;ary to keep to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our proper Province, <HI>(Hoc age, en tutois i&s;thi)</HI> and &s;hould we not call to mind the notable Council of the famous <HI>German,</HI> who of a Mini&s;ter of Religion became a Mini&s;ter of State, and for &s;ome Mi&s;|management being condemn'd to die, generou&s;ly left for our In&s;truction this Di&s;tick.</P>

<P>LET us relieve Mens outward Wants as far as we have Ability and Opportunity: This, above all other In&s;tances of Goodne&s;s, is particularized in the &s;criptural De&s;cription we have of the <HI>General Judgment,</HI> I <HI>was Hungry and ye fed me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>O! let us forgive Injuries, <HI>he &s;hall have Judgment without Mercy, who hath &s;hewed no Mercy. If we forgive not Men their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es neither will God forgive ours.</HI></P>
<P>O! let us beware of <HI>ra&s;h judging, why do&s;t thou judge thy Bro|ther, or why do&s;t thou &s;et at nought thy Brother, for we &s;hall all &s;tand before the Judgment Seat of</HI> Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>AND on the Contrary, dear Sirs, O let us labour to increa&s;e in that glorious Grace of LOVE, <HI>which hopes all Things, &s;uffers long, and is kind, and is not ea&s;ily provok'd.</HI> And let the Thoughts of the <HI>la&s;t Judgment</HI> deter us from Inju&s;tice, Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Light|ne&s;s of Mind and Behaviour. <HI>Let no Man go beyond and defraud his Neighbour, for God is the avenger of all &s;uch.</HI> Seeing then that all the&s;e Things &s;hall come to pa&s;s, which the Scriptures

&s;peak of the la&s;t <HI>Judgment, what manner of Per&s;ons ought we to be in all holy Conver&s;ation and Godline&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>THE Con&s;ideration of the <HI>la&s;t Judgment</HI> may &s;erve to keep us from <HI>Infidelity,</HI> becau&s;e of the Confu&s;ions and Inju&s;tice that are in the World, for this is but a &s;hort Time of Trial; after the Conclu&s;ion of this Drama, all Things will be put to Rights and appear in their proper Colours. What tho' we endure unju&s;t in|vectives for a Time, God <HI>will bring forth the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his People as the Light, and their Judgment as the noon Day;</HI> and hence the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, <HI>it was a &s;mall Thing to him, to be judged of Man's Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, <HI>Sirs,</HI> we &s;hould be excited to examine our Sates, our Principles of Action, our Speeches and Works, and &s;ee whether they will &s;tand the tryal of the <HI>la&s;t Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>METHINKS, dear Brethren, the Con&s;ideration of the <HI>la&s;t Judg|ment,</HI> may ju&s;tly &s;trike <HI>Terror</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ternation</HI> into every Tribe of Impeninents; if it be con&s;idered, that it &s;hall be univer&s;al as to Per&s;ons and Things, as well as impartial and irrever&s;ible. God <HI>will bring to Judgment every Work, with every &s;ecret Thing;</HI> he will bring to light <HI>the hidden Things of Darkne&s;s, and make ma|nife&s;t the Councils of the Heart,</HI> as I before ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t &s;ecret impious Thought mu&s;t then be di&s;clo&s;ed, and the mo&s;t di&s;gui&s;ed Contrivances brought to the open light of <HI>Day;</HI> and it is but rea&s;onable it &s;hould be &s;o, &s;eeing the moral Good and Evil of Actions much depend upon their Intention. The Lord <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who is a <HI>di&s;cerner of the Thoughts, and &s;earcher of the Heart,</HI> will, in the Day of his coming, examine and open the &s;ecret Springs of the Actions of Men; and then likewi&s;e &s;hall their Words be &s;can'd and judg'd; and this is but rea&s;onable, &s;eeing they are the mo&s;t natural Indications of the Temper and Di&s;po|&s;ition of the Mind, and often do much Injury to the Names, Bodies and E&s;tates of Men. Our Lord a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>that Men mu&s;t give an Account of every idle Word in that Day, (Mat.</HI> xii. 36, 37.) <HI>and that by our Words we &s;hall be ju&s;tifyed, and by our Words we &s;hall be condemned.</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Jude</HI> informs us, that <HI>Enoch,</HI> the &s;eventh from <HI>Adam,</HI> prophe&s;ied of the&s;e Things &s;aying, <HI>that the LORD &s;hall come with with ten Thou&s;and of his Saints to ex|ecute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly of their ungodly Deeds and hard Speeches.</HI> How &s;hall the <HI>lyar,</HI> the <HI>unju&s;t Per&s;on,</HI> the <HI>whoremonger,</HI> the <HI>&s;landerer</HI> and <HI>back-biter</HI> then appear.</P>
<P>AND every evil Action mu&s;t then be &s;tript of all its pre&s;ent di&s;|gui&s;es, and open'd in its horid deformity; yea and the Evils we have induced others to commit, we mu&s;t then an&s;wer for. There a light &s;hall be &s;truck into all the Works of Darkne&s;s, thro all the pretexts of Subtilty, and every impenitent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, with out Di&s;tinction, will be covered with Confu&s;ion, and expos'd to contempt and &s;corn!</P>
<P>The <HI>Alexanders</HI> and <HI>Nimrords</HI> of the Earth, and all the Sons of Violence, of Blood and Rapine, that have &s;acrificed the Lives of
<PB N="8" REF="006427_0005_1028E4F4B3FD24A0">
Thou&s;ands to their Ambition and Avarice, and made Nations tremble before them, mu&s;t &s;tand appal'd before their Judge to receive their final Sentence: Then will they cur&s;e the madne&s;s of their Arrogance, and <HI>cry to the Hills and Mountains to fall on them, and hide them from the Face of him that &s;itteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</HI> All the human Race mu&s;t appear at the dreadful Summons.

At that Tribunal there will be no difference or re&s;pect of Per&s;ons ob&s;erved between the greate&s;t Prince and meane&s;t Pea&s;ant And that which makes the <HI>General Judgment</HI> the more &s;olemn and dreadful, is that there will be no Appeal forever from the Sen|tence of the Judge.</P>
<P>WITH what awful Solemnity does the holy Scriptures repre&s;ent the Scene of the la&s;t Judgement, then, we are told, that <HI>there will be di&s;tre&s;s of Nations, with perplexity, the Sea roaring and Men's Hearts failing them for fear, that then the Sun &s;hall be darkned and the Moon &s;hall not give her Light, and all the Powers of Heaven be &s;haken;</HI> that the <HI>Archangel</HI>'s <HI>Trumpet &s;hall &s;ound to the Extremities of the Earth, after which the Son of Man &s;hall de&s;cend from the vi&s;ible Heavens in a Cloud, and appear in his own and in his Father</HI>'s <HI>Glory. Thou&s;ands of Angels &s;hall mini&s;ter to him, and ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and &s;hall &s;tand before him!</HI> The Son of GOD will come with Power and great Glory in flaming Fire, <HI>to take Vengeance on tho&s;e that know not GOD, and that obey not the Go&s;pel of our Lord</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting De&s;truction from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.

<P>THEN the Almighty Judge &s;hall be &s;eated upon his Saphire Throne from which the Earth and Heavens &s;hall flee away.</P>
<P>WHEN our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour came to &s;uffer for the Sins of the World, he came in the Form of a Servant, and vail'd his Glory with a <HI>clayie Mantle;</HI> he &s;toop'd to a&s;&s;ume the Infirmities of Hu|manity in the mo&s;t humble Circum&s;tances, and was expo&s;ed to Cruelty and Contempt: But when he comes as a Judge, he will a&s;&s;ume his proper Greatne&s;s, and appear with a Splendor &s;uitable to the Dignity of his Office, &s;uitable to the Glory of his Charac|ter! <HI>All Nature &s;hall tremble before him, and the Foundations of the Hills &s;hall &s;hake becau&s;e he is Wroth!</HI> The Sars &s;hall &s;tart from their Orbs, and the Canopy of the vi&s;ible Heavens &s;hall &s;hrivel up into a flaming &s;croll, and the whole Earth &s;hall be a burning trembling Globe of Fire.

<P>O &s;ecure Sinners, your Eyes and Ears &s;hall &s;ee and hear the&s;e Things! O what a &s;crole of Mourning and Lamentation and Woe &s;hall then be opened before you? (<HI>Rev.</HI> i. 7.) <HI>Behold he cometh in the Clouds, and every Eye &s;hall &s;ee him, and tho&s;e al&s;o that peirced him, and all the Kindreds of the Earth &s;hall wail be|cau&s;e of him,</HI> O Sinners! Sinners! realize the&s;e awful Events by frequent and believing Mediation, and make it the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life to &s;ecure a <HI>Retreat</HI> from the <HI>Tempe&s;ts</HI> of <HI>divine Vengeance,</HI> under the <HI>Wing</HI> of IMANUEL, by bewailing your Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t him, and by believing in him; &s;et your Faces towards <HI>Zyon</HI> with a religious Re&s;olution, enquire the Way thither with humble Importunity, and weep as ye go! <HI>O let your Laugh|ter be turned into Mourning, and your Joy into Heavine&s;s! Rent your Hearts and not your Garments, and turn unto the Lord your God,</HI> for tho' he be ju&s;t and righteous, jealous and omnipotent,

<P>SIRS, the &s;tronge&s;t Images we can form of the Maje&s;ty of GOD, and the terrible Effects of his angry Re&s;entment are in|finitely too feeble and languid to give an adequate Repre&s;entation thereof. O therefore <HI>let us ki&s;s the Son, lea&s;t he be angry and we peri&s;h from the Way, when his Wrath is kindled but a little, ble&s;&s;ed are all they that put their Tru&s;t in him.</HI> By this may we all be hid in the great and terrible Day of GOD's Anger, thro' JESUS CHRIST our LORD. AMEN. AMEN.</P>
