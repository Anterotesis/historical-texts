<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AFTER I had delive|red &s;ome Part of the following <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> at the publick Lecture in BOSTON; I was repea|tedly de&s;ired to give a Copy of the &s;everal Sermons which
<PB N="ii" REF="005117_0003_1016A823B4667590">I had &s;ome Years ago preached to my own People upon this Subject. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Preach'd at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> 1739.</NOTE> And when I called to Mind the ge|neral Acceptance they met with, when preached at Home; as well as the Approbation that Part of them met with, which was delivered A|broad, I yielded to the Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>But the grand Inducement was this, that I apprehended it to be a very u&s;eful Subject in it&s;elf, and a very &s;ea&s;onable one for the pre&s;ent Day.</P>
<P>For when there are &s;o many Di&s;|putes among Chri&s;tians; what will &s;erve better to compo&s;e, and calm their Spirits towards each other, than to be &s;en&s;ible of this, that thro' the Weakne&s;s, Ignorance, and remaining
<PB N="iii" REF="005117_0003_1016A823B4667590">Corruption in Chri&s;tians, it may &s;o happen, that they may widely differ in &s;ome Points from each other; and yet be the true Children of God? And what is there that has &s;uch a happy Tendency to re&s;tore, and pre&s;erve Charity, Peace, and Union one with another; as a full Per&s;wa&s;ion that &s;ome who have different Sentiments from us, may, in the general, be un|der the Influence of the &s;ame gracious Spirit with us, Friends of CHRIST, united to him by Faith as well as <HI>we,</HI> as much concerned for the Honour and Intere&s;t of CHRIST as <HI>we,</HI> and as much concerned to get to Heaven as <HI>we,</HI> and may have as &s;ure a Title to that glorious Inheritance as <HI>we?</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, as there are &s;o many Di&s;putes about the true Marks and Signs of Adoption, and as to the Per|&s;ons that may be reckoned the dear
<PB N="iv" REF="005117_0004_1016A8269CD38C10">Children of GOD; it cannot be un|&s;ea&s;onable, when the glorious Privi|leges of GOD'S Children, and the great Duty of &s;eeking the cleare&s;t Evidences of being of that happy Number, are &s;et forth; at the &s;ame Time to point out the many fal&s;e and uncertain Marks that People are apt to fix upon, and re&s;t &s;atisfied with, that &s;uch &s;elf-flattering and &s;elf-deceiving Souls, may be &s;haken off from their fal&s;e Foundations, and build their Hopes upon no other than what is laid in CHRIST, and in his Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>And although all who call them|&s;elves the Children of GOD, allow that the <HI>being led and governed by the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of</HI> GOD, is the &s;ure&s;t Mark of Adoption; yet even here Chri&s;ti|ans very often differ, and are in Danger of making Mi&s;takes; ma|king
<PB N="v" REF="005117_0004_1016A8269CD38C10">&s;ome Things to be the Opera|tion of GOD'S SPIRIT, that are not; or denying &s;ome Things to be the Work of the SPIRIT of GOD, which do really come from him.</P>
<P>Accordingly, &s;everal of the en&s;u|ing Di&s;cour&s;es are taken up in &s;et|ting this Matter in the true&s;t and cleare&s;t Light I was capable of; giving the Scripture, and only the Scripture Marks and Signs of being led by the SPIRIT of GOD. And by the&s;e Rules I de&s;ire every Reader would carefully examine him&s;elf, and not re&s;t &s;atisfied in any Tokens of Regeneration and Adoption, &s;hort hereof.</P>
<P>In reading this little Book, you will meet with very clo&s;e Que&s;tions; I de&s;ire you would read them di&s;|tinctly, and after a &s;erious Pau&s;e up|on
<PB N="vi" REF="005117_0005_1016A82B48F601A0">on them, put them very clo&s;ely to your &s;elves, and let Con&s;cience &s;peak the Truth.</P>
<P>I entreat Chri&s;tians of every Party, who look over the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, to do it with Candour, and let the un|worthy Author have an Intere&s;t in your Prayers.</P>
<P>And may the ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT, who (I hope) a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in compo&s;ing, a&s;&s;i&s;t you in reading, and &s;o accom|pany the&s;e Things into your Hearts, as that you may know by happy Ex|perience, what it is to be under his ble&s;&s;ed and gracious Influences. And may that SPIRIT of GOD, <HI>who &s;earch|eth all Things, even the deep Things of</HI> GOD, a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the Trial of your &s;elves by his own Rules, and may he &s;hine upon his own Work wherever it is wrought, and carry it

<HEAD>Every Child of GOD, <HI>led by one</HI> SPIRIT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ROM. viii. 14.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE whole World of Mankind is divided into two Sorts, <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Sinners;</HI> the Children of God, and the Children of the wicked One. And <HI>that</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;hes Men, and truly fixes one or the other of the&s;e Characters upon them, is the <HI>Spirit within,</HI> which leads and governs
<PB N="2" REF="005117_0007_1016A831A30E5998">them. For every Man is a Child of God, or a Child of the Devil, according to the Spirit he is govern'd by. They who are under the tyrannical Power of carnal, worldly, and wicked Principles are of their Father the Devil; whil&s;t &s;uch as are governed by a divine and gracious Principle are the Children of God. My Text leads to con&s;ider only this latter Sort of Per&s;ons. <HI>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God. As many,</HI> how many &s;o|ever, or what Nation or People, of what Sta|tion, and Condition of Life &s;oever, and what different Per&s;wa&s;ion &s;oever as to &s;ome particular Points of Chri&s;tianity, and whatever Apprehen|&s;ion others may have of them, or they may have of others; yet if they are led by the Spirit of God, that is, if they are under the gracious Guidance and Government of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, they are the Children of God.</P>
<P>And as &s;o many who are thus led and go|vern'd are the Children of God, &s;o there are no more to be reckoned in that happy Number. For let Men be never &s;o thoro' in their Know|ledge, never &s;o orthodox in their Principles, let them make never &s;o high a Profe&s;&s;ion, and appear never &s;o zealous about religious Matters, let their Character run never &s;o high among Men, even as the mo&s;t eminent Saints; yet if they be not led, if they be not inlivened and influenced by the Spirit of God, he will not own them for his Sons, or his Daughters. For
<PB N="3" REF="005117_0007_1016A831A30E5998">if any Man have not <HI>the Spirit</HI> of Chri&s;t, he is none of <HI>his,</HI> as in the 9th Ver&s;e of the Context.</P>
<P>And now without any further Opening the Words, or taking up your Time, in &s;hewing how the Words &s;tand related to the preceeding or following Part of the Chapter, which might afford many profitable Thoughts to us, I &s;hall proceed immediately to con&s;ider the doctrinal Truth which lyes very obvious in the Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE. <HI>The &s;ure&s;t and cleare&s;t Mark of our being the Children of God, is our being led and govern'd by the Spirit of God.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Here are two Propo&s;itions that lye very fairly to be &s;poken to, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

The &s;ame divine Spirit, the &s;ame gracious and heavenly Principle animates and actuates every Saint. For as all tho&s;e who are led by the Spirit of God are his Children; &s;o all his Children are led by his Spirit. There is not &s;o much as one real Saint upon Earth, but what is under the gracious and powerful In|fluence of the divine Spirit, as the prevailing governing Principle in the Soul. Every Saint and true Believer is united to God and Chri&s;t by the holy Spirit. They dwell in him, and he in them <HI>by the holy Spirit, that is given to them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John 4.13.</NOTE>. There is one Body, and there is one Spirit</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4.4.</NOTE>. As one Soul or Spirit animates the humane Body, even all the Organs and Mem|bers of it, &s;o the Church, that is, the living Members thereof, which are the Body of Chri&s;t, are animated and govern'd by one Spirit. They are all <HI>born</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Spirit,</HI> and &s;o have the &s;ame divine Life breathed into them. They have thro' Chri&s;t acce&s;s <HI>by one Spirit</HI> unto the Father <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 2.18.</NOTE>. And every true Believer is united one to another by the &s;ame Spirit that dwells in them.</P>
<P>As the Son of God, the Seed of the Woman, was promi&s;ed immediately after the Fall, and in the Fulne&s;s of Time was &s;ent into the World, to make Attonement for Sin, and to make Way for God to pardon and &s;ave all that believe in
<PB N="5" REF="005117_0008_1016A836E1E94258">him: So the Spirit of God was &s;ent into the World to begin and carry on the Work of di|vine Grace in Men's Soul's. And this Spirit has been in the World operating upon, and leading and governing the Saints in all Ages from the Beginning of the World unto this Day.</P>
<P>Indeed we read in our Saviour's Time (which was near four thou&s;and Years after the Fall of <HI>Adam</HI>) <HI>that the Holy Gho&s;t was not</HI> YET <HI>given, becau&s;e that Je&s;us was not yet glorified</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 7.39.</NOTE>. And he tells his Di&s;ciples that it was expedient for them, that he &s;hould go away, for if he did not depart, <HI>the Comforter, which is the Holy Gho&s;t, would not come unto them, but if he depart|ed he would &s;end him unto them</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John 16.7.</NOTE>. Which Ex|pre&s;&s;ions may at fir&s;t Glance look as if the Holy Gho&s;t or the Spirit of God, had not been in the World, nor operating upon the Hearts of Men, 'till <HI>that</HI> Time.</P>
<P>But now <HI>that</HI> Coming of the Holy Gho&s;t which Chri&s;t foretells and promi&s;es, is not to be under&s;tood as if the Spirit of God had never been at all manife&s;ted before that Time; but it doubtle&s;s intends the more glorious Manife&s;ta|tion of him, in tho&s;e extraordinary and <HI>mira|culous Gifts</HI> which were be&s;towed upon the A|po&s;tles, and other Di&s;ciples, after Chri&s;t's A&s;|cen&s;ion: And al&s;o the extraordinary <HI>gracious
<PB N="6" REF="005117_0009_1016A839AC3FD5C8">Influences</HI> which he had on the Hearts of Multi|tudes at that Time.</P>
<P>But it is by no means to be under&s;tood as if the Spirit of God had not been operating upon the Hearts of Men before that Time. For it is certain that the Spirit of God had been com|municating both Gifts and Graces, thro' all the Ages of the Church.</P>
<P>All the Prophets of Old were in&s;pired with the Gift of Prophecy, from <HI>the &s;ame Spirit;</HI> for it was when the Spirit of the Lord was upon them, that they prophe&s;ied. <HI>For the Prophecy came not in old Time by the Will of Man, but holy Men of God &s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 1.21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>&s;ame divine Spirit</HI> which has wrought powerfully and effectually upon true Believers &s;ince the Coming of Chri&s;t, wrought in and upon every gracious Saint from the Be|ginning of the World to <HI>that</HI> Time. <HI>The &s;ame Spirit</HI> that opened the Heart of <HI>Lydia</HI> to receive the Word, opened the Eyes of the P&s;almi&s;t to behold the wondrous Things out of God's Law. The <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> which the P&s;almi&s;t prays might not be <HI>taken</HI> from him, and the <HI>free Spirit</HI> which he prays God to <HI>uphold him with</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 51.11, 12.</NOTE>, was the <HI>&s;ame Spirit</HI> who has been with, and has up|held every Chri&s;tian in the Ways of God, and by who&s;e mighty Power they have been pre|&s;erved
<PB N="7" REF="005117_0009_1016A839AC3FD5C8">thro' Faith unto Salvation. In &s;hort, there have been Strivings of the Spirit of God from the Beginning: And every one that has been bro't into a State of Grace, and &s;o made a Child of God, from <HI>Adam</HI> to this Day, it has been by the gracious and powerful Operations of <HI>this</HI> Spirit.</P>
<P>And as there is that <HI>Unity of the Spirit</HI> by which every real Member of Chri&s;t is <HI>united</HI> to him and to one another; &s;o there is a great <HI>Uniformity</HI> in the Operations of this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, upon the Soul of every Saint; that is to &s;ay, he in the General forms the &s;ame Tem|per and Di&s;po&s;ition in them; puts them under the Influence of the &s;ame good Principle, and leads them to the &s;ame gracious Views and De&s;igns in their Actions, &s;o that it may be &s;aid that in the General there is the &s;ame gracious Temper and Principle, the &s;ame gracious Views and De&s;igns in every Child of God. And therefore whatever Difference there may be in their Sentiments upon &s;ome religious Points, and how hardly &s;oever they may judge and treat one another; yet &s;ay, that if they are the Children of God they are in the General under the governing Influence of the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed Spirit; and it may be &s;aid of all of them, that a Principle of Grace wrought by the &s;ame Spi|rit, is the prevailing Principle in their Souls.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e this is a very important Truth; and yet perhaps not &s;o much thought upon as
<PB N="8" REF="005117_0010_1016A83BC0213018">it &s;hould be, and the due Con&s;ideration of which would &s;erve very much to direct Chri&s;tians how to conduct them&s;elves one towards another, I will therefore &s;pend a few Minutes in illu&s;tra|ting and confirming this Point, and then pro|ceed to the other Propo&s;ition which I have my Eye mainly upon.</P>
<P>Here then let me briefly &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Children of God often differ from one another in many Points, and &s;ometimes carry the&s;e Differences to a very great Length.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Notwith&s;tanding this, they are really under the governing Influence of the &s;ame divine Spirit, in the General.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>I will then mention &s;ome uniform Operations of the Spirit upon their Souls and &s;hew wherein they agree.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Children of God often differ from one another in many Points, and &s;ometimes carry their Differences to a very great Length.</HI></P>
<P>For altho' God has favoured his Church with as clear and as full a Revelation as is needful to in&s;truct us in every Thing <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to be known or done; yet as to many <HI>other Things</HI> the Re|velation is not &s;o particular, but it leaves Room and gives Occa&s;ion for a great Variety of Opi|nions among the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t: Which is too evident to need a Proof, and the In&s;tances too many to pretend to mention them. The many Di&s;putes that have been among Chri&s;tians
<PB N="9" REF="005117_0010_1016A83BC0213018">about doctrinal, yea, and practical Points from the Apo&s;tles Times to this Day, are a Demon|&s;tration hereof.</P>
<P>And the&s;e Differences in Opinion and in Practice, have ari&s;en very much from the diffe|rent Education, and from the different Advan|tages Men have had for gaining Light and Knowledge; yea, and from the different Powers and Capacities of Men for &s;eeing into Things, and judging upon them, &s;ome having a much greater Reach and Extent of Thought than others. The&s;e Differences may al&s;o ari&s;e from the different Humour and Temper of Men, for there is &s;uch a Difference even in Men's Con&s;titutions, as inclines &s;ome Men to one Way of Thinking, and &s;ome to another Way.</P>
<P>But then Chri&s;tians have not contented them|&s;elves with having different Opinions, and diffe|rent Methods of practi&s;ing in &s;ome particular In&s;tances; but have indulged them&s;elves in hard Thoughts, and &s;evere Cen&s;uring one ano|ther. One has judged his Neighbour, and his Neighbour has de&s;pi&s;ed him. Oh how have the Children of God thro' Weakne&s;s and Ig|norance in them&s;elves been charging <HI>the&s;e</HI> and wor&s;e Things upon their chri&s;tian Brethren! How common is it for the Children of God to place &s;o much of their Religion in tho&s;e parti|cular Things wherein they differ (or even they think they differ) from others, as to condemn
<PB N="10" REF="005117_0011_1016A83D8CFF35A0">all that don't come exactly into the &s;ame Sen|timents, and run the &s;ame Lengths with them? &mdash;Nay, it would be a Breach of chri&s;tian Cha|rity, not to &s;uppo&s;e, that even God's own Children have per&s;ecuted one another, accor|ding to the Power that has been in their Hands: Ca&s;ting them out of their Communion, and loading them with Reproaches, and inflicting heavy Puni&s;hments upon them, nay, I dare not &s;ay to the contrary, but that God's own Chil|dren have been &s;o far left to their own Weak|ne&s;s, Ignorance and Prejudice with the other remaining Lu&s;ts, as to kill one another for their Differences in Religion, thinking herein to do God good Service.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Notwith&s;tanding this, all the Children of God are under the governing Influence of the &s;ame divine Spirit in the General.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' the Difference be &s;ometimes &s;o wide between true Chri&s;tians as I have mentioned, yet they are united by the Spirit of God, and are in the General under the prevailing Influence of the &s;ame gracious Principle.</P>
<P>But here I would not be mi&s;taken; I don't &s;ay that in the Things wherein they differ, or wherein they uncharitably cen&s;ure or per&s;ecute each other, that in <HI>the&s;e</HI> they are under the go|verning Influence of the divine Spirit. No, the judging and treating each other in &s;uch a &s;evere and uncharitable Manner, is frequently

But what I mean is, that &s;ome who have gone even to &s;uch extraordinary Lengths in contending about re|ligious Matters as I have mentioned, may not|with&s;tanding be under the governing Influence of the &s;ame good Spirit, and the &s;ame gracious Principle in general, with tho&s;e they contend with, and treat after &s;uch a Manner.</P>
<P>For altho' all the Children of God are led by the Spirit of God, yet this don't &s;uppo&s;e the having a <HI>Spirit of Infallibility;</HI> &s;o as to be led into every Truth whether nece&s;&s;ary or no, or to be kept from every Error: Nor does it &s;up|po&s;e every Saint to be &s;o under the governing and re&s;training Influences of the Spirit, as to be con&s;tantly kept from all out-breakings of Sin and Corruption, or from the Power of every Tempta|tion. This would be a State of Perfection which the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> had not attained unto <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. 3.12.</NOTE>, nor is it to be expected in the pre&s;ent World.</P>
<P>The Spirit of God is not concern'd to have every one that is born of the Spirit, perfectly to agree in all their Thoughts, and in all their Methods of acting, as to the Non-e&s;&s;entials of Chri&s;tianity; but for wi&s;e &amp; holy Ends &s;uffers it to be otherwi&s;e. He don't &s;ee Cau&s;e to &s;ave them from every Error, that is not fatal, nor from
<PB N="12" REF="005117_0012_1016A8409F2F3EF0">every Degree of Corruption that is not incon|&s;i&s;tent with a Principle of Grace. And if we don't allow this to be the Truth, I know not where to find any of the Sons of God. It is the Confe&s;&s;ion of one of Chri&s;t's own Apo&s;tle's, <HI>That in many Things we offend all <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jam. 3.2.</NOTE>. And who can under&s;tand his Errors?

<P>So that Men may run into &s;ome Errors in Judgment, and may practi&s;e upon the&s;e Errors &s;o as widely to differ from one another, and hardly cen&s;ure, and &s;everely per&s;ecute each o|ther; and yet it is po&s;&s;ible they may all of them have the Spirit of God leading and governing them in their general Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Nay, I think I may venture to &s;ay, that even the gracious Principle that is within them, thro' the Ignorance and Error that God &s;uffers &s;till to abide with them, may be the Means of &s;ome of the Contentions of chri&s;tian Brethren, and of their zealous Per&s;ecutions of each other. That is, it is po&s;&s;ible that the Aim and the Principle may be good in both Parties, a Concern for the Honour of God and Chri&s;t, and for pre&s;erving the &s;uppo&s;ed Truths, and maintaining the &s;up|po&s;ed Duties of his holy Religion, may prompt both Parties to be &s;evere upon one another.
<PB N="13" REF="005117_0012_1016A8409F2F3EF0">And the Error may be only in the Under&s;tand|ing and Judgment, and &s;o in applying this Concern for the Honour of God, and of Reli|gion, in a wrong Ca&s;e, or in an undue Mea|&s;ure, or in an improper Method.</P>
<P>My Meaning is, that Men who are apparent|ly in great Oppo&s;ition to each other, may have the <HI>&s;ame hone&s;t good Principle at the Bottom.</HI> And their Ignorance, Weakne&s;s and Mi&s;take is the Cau&s;e of their oppo&s;ing one another. And they are really contending for the &s;ame Thing ultimately, but in a different Scheme.</P>
<P>And why &s;hould it be thought an extrava|gant Degree of Charity to &s;uppo&s;e this? Don't we &s;ee Men pur&s;uing the Profits of this World in very different, yea, in &s;eemingly contrary Ways: And yet we have no doubt but that both of them have a &s;ufficient Love to the World, and real De&s;ires to get what they can of it. One Trader we &s;hall &s;ee &s;elling his Goods as dear as he can, thinking that to be the likelie&s;t Way to get an E&s;tate. Another we &s;hall &s;ee &s;elling his Commodities as cheap as po&s;&s;ibly he can afford, thinking this to be the mo&s;t probable Way of increa&s;ing his Cu&s;tom, and &s;o that he &s;hall find his Profit in the Con|clu&s;ion. Now the&s;e Men may think ami&s;s of each other, and be offended at each other, e&s;pecially when their Bu&s;ine&s;s may interfere, but who will que&s;tion, but that they are both &s;et upon gaining the World? And why may it not
<PB N="14" REF="005117_0013_1016A84637C6B790">&s;ometimes be &s;o among Men as to the Things of God and of Religion? Nay, it mu&s;t needs be &s;o in many of tho&s;e Ca&s;es wherein we &s;ee Chri&s;tians contending with one another. For we &s;hall by an intimate Acquaintance with &s;ome of both Parties, be obliged in a Judgment of Charity to rank them among the Children of God.</P>
<P>Who ever doubted but that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Bar|nabas</HI> were both good Men, eminently holy and good Men; and yet they who had been &s;uch intimate Friends and Companions in the Service of Chri&s;t and of his Go&s;pel; differ'd at length and fell into &s;uch a <HI>&s;harp Contention, that they departed a&s;under the one from the other</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts 15.39.</NOTE>. And whoever reads the Occa&s;ion of it, will be led to fear that it was not owing entirely to Igno|rance and Mi&s;take of Judgment, but that Pa&s;&s;ion and Self-Will and &s;uch like Remnants of the <HI>old Man,</HI> had a Hand in the Quarrel, which very likely they &s;aw, and were humble for afterwards.</P>
<P>But now you will be ready to &s;ay, that if &s;uch who are led by the &s;ame Spirit even the Spirit of God, do oftentimes &s;o widely differ, and have &s;uch fierce Oppo&s;itions, wherein do they agree? Or what uniform Influences of the Spirit may be found in them? And this
<PB N="15" REF="005117_0013_1016A84637C6B790">leads me to the third Thing propo&s;ed under the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>I am to mention &s;ome In&s;tances, wherein all true Chri&s;tians agree, or &s;ome of the uniform Operations of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit upon their Souls.</HI></P>
<P>For whatever Difference or Oppo&s;ition there is among Chri&s;tians; yet the divine Spirit is uniform in his Operations and Influences upon their Souls. And con&s;equently there mu&s;t be in the general, the &s;ame Views, the &s;ame Prin|ciples governing tho&s;e to whom the Spirit of God comes in a &s;aving effectual Manner. For altho' there may appear &s;ome Diver&s;ity in the Operations of the Spirit; yet this Appearance ari&s;es from the different Tempers, the different Education, the different Capacities, the diffe|rent Employments, Temptations and Circum|&s;tances of the Per&s;ons who are wrought upon, and not from any real Difference in the Ope|rations of the Spirit him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>With Re&s;pect to true Chri&s;tians (for of &s;uch only am I &s;peaking) there is in all of them, the &s;ame Principle of</HI> FAITH <HI>in God, and in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, wrought by the divine Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Every true Chri&s;tian is led by the Spirit to believe not only that <HI>God is,</HI> and that he is <HI>a Rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him;</HI> but is al&s;o led by the &s;ame Spirit to believe that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is;</HI> and that he is the <HI>only</HI> &amp; the <HI>almighty
<PB N="16" REF="005117_0014_1016A847E4268828">Saviour.</HI> Accordingly every true Believer is led to have his <HI>Dependance</HI> upon the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for Salvation.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible that true Believers may have &s;ome different Conceptions as to &s;ome Circum&s;tances relating to the Way of our Salvation by Chri&s;t, and may have different Ways of explaining their Faith in, and Dependance upon him: But they have all really the &s;ame Tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, and hearty Acceptance of him, wrought in them by the Spirit. For this Faith according to the Go&s;pel Covenant is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Being of a true Chri&s;tian, and to his find|ing Acceptance with God, and obtaining Sal|vation.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In every Child of God there is the &s;ame real</HI> SORROW <HI>for</HI> SIN, <HI>and</HI> HATRED <HI>of it, wrought by the Spirit of God.</HI></P>
<P>Wherever the Spirit of God works effectually be&s;ure he <HI>convinces of Sin,</HI> and begets real Grief and Shame for every Thing which Con&s;cience accu&s;es the Man of as &s;inful, and there is a real Hatred begotten in all &s;uch, of every Thing that appears to them as &s;inful, and there is a Re&s;olution and Care wrought in every &s;uch Soul, to depart from all Manner of Sin, <HI>even from their own Iniquity</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 18.23.</NOTE>, and &s;uch a Repen|tance is the only Repentance unto Salvation. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark 16.16.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="005117_0014_1016A847E4268828">
Indeed the Children of God may differ about &s;ome Things whether they be &s;inful or no. For altho' as to moral Sins in general, e&s;pecially the gro&s;&s;er Ones, they are &s;o plainly &s;et down in the Bible, that nothing but gro&s;s Ignorance and great Carele&s;sne&s;s would lead Men into any Error as to them, yet there are &s;ome Things wherein the Revelation is not &s;o clear, but there may very ea&s;ily Di&s;putes ari&s;e whether <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> be a Sin or no. But in all the Children of God there is this Principle wrought, by his Spirit, heartily to mourn and grieve for all that they are &s;en&s;ible they have done ami&s;s, and to hate and &s;trive again&s;t every Thing that appears plainly to them to be contrary to the Will of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There is in every Child of God the &s;ame Principle of</HI> SINCERE <HI>and</HI> SUPREME LOVE <HI>to God and Chri&s;t, by the &s;ame Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>This is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for every true Chri&s;tian, and to his being &s;uch an one. For <HI>to love the Lord our God with all our Heart,</HI> &amp;c. is the fir&s;t and great Commandment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 22.37, 38.</NOTE>. And unle&s;s we love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t above every Thing in this World; yea, and above our very Lives, we cannot be his Di&s;ciples <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke 14.26.</NOTE>. Accor|dingly every Child of God has the Love of God and of Chri&s;t, &s;hed abroad in his Heart by
<PB N="18" REF="005117_0015_1016A84AE7044418">the Holy Gho&s;t, whereby he has the highe&s;t E&s;teem of God, and of the Redeemer, real De&s;ires after him, and Delight in him, and an hearty Concern for his Honour and Glory.</P>
<P>But now a Zeal for the Honour of God, and of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for Want of Know|ledge to direct it, is oftentimes the Cau&s;e of great Divi&s;ions, and &s;harp Contentions among chri&s;tian Brethren. For one thinks that by the&s;e Doctrines, and by the&s;e Methods of Con|duct, Chri&s;t is di&s;honoured, and &s;o he is zealous again&s;t them. The other thinks they rather tend to the Honour of Chri&s;t, and &s;o is as zea|lous for them. In both which Ca&s;es they may po&s;&s;ibly be govern'd by the &s;ame Principle of Love, and have the Honour of Chri&s;t equally at Heart. And it is the Ignorance or Mi&s;take of one or both that cau&s;es the Difference.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>There is in all of them the &s;ame Principle of</HI> SUBJECTION <HI>and</HI> OBEDIENCE <HI>to God.</HI></P>
<P>Every Child of God has a Sen&s;e of his divine Authority, and of his &s;overeign Right to pre|&s;cribe Laws to all his Creatures, and he looks upon the revealed Will of God in his Word, as the Rule for him to walk by, and the Lan|guage of every gracious Soul is, <HI>What&s;oever the Lord my God &s;hall &s;ay unto me, that will I do.</HI></P>
<P>But now the Children of God may differ in their Opinion in &s;ome le&s;&s;er, and more ob&s;cure
<PB N="19" REF="005117_0015_1016A84AE7044418">Points, &s;o far as that one may think <HI>that</HI> a Duty, which the other thinks rather a Sin than a Duty, and &s;o from the &s;ame Principle one may refrain from it, and the other comply with it.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>There is in all the Children of God the &s;ame Spirit of</HI> LOVE <HI>and</HI> CHARITY <HI>towards Man|kind.</HI></P>
<P>Every Child of God loves his Brother, and in &s;ome Degree comes up to the Command, of loving his Neighbour as him&s;elf. And altho' a great Part of what pa&s;&s;es in the World for <HI>brotherly Love</HI> is mere Counterfeit, and is only <HI>in Word</HI> and <HI>in Tongue;</HI> yet I have &s;o much Charity as to believe that true real Love and Charity is &s;ometimes concealed under &s;uch Carriage and Behaviour towards one other as &s;eems very oppo&s;ite to it.</P>
<P>For we mu&s;t under&s;tand that this Charity to our Neighbour, con&s;i&s;ts not only in thinking as well as we can of him, but in wi&s;hing well to him, and in doing tho&s;e Things which we ap|prehend will be mo&s;t u&s;eful and beneficial to him, both to his Soul and Body. And now this gives a great Latitude in the Manner of treating one another; and yet pre&s;erving a Prin|ciple of Love at the Bottom. And the diffe|rent Treatment may ari&s;e from the different Apprehen&s;ions Men may have of manife&s;ting
<PB N="20" REF="005117_0016_1016A84F000A2990">their Love to one another. For Charity towards our Neighbour, don't &s;uppo&s;e, but that we may &s;ee his Faults, and apprehend him to be in Errors, and if &s;o then the Principle of Love may work very differently, according to the different Apprehen&s;ions Men may have as to the Manner of treating &s;uch a Neighbour, &s;o as will be the greate&s;t Kindne&s;s to him.</P>
<P>Thus one who looks upon his Neighbour to be in a Fault, or in an Error, apprehends a mild and gentle Management will be&s;t An&s;wer the End, for convincing and reclaiming a faulty Brother, and in this Way manife&s;ts his Love to him. Another thinks that &s;uch a gentle Way of treating him, would be hurtful to the Man him&s;elf, and dangerous to others, and &s;o from the &s;ame Principle of Love, proceeds in a more &s;evere and rigorous Manner with him. And now &s;ometimes one, and &s;ometimes the other of the&s;e may be in the Wrong in the Applica|tion of their different Means to recover their Brother that is in an Error or overtaken with a Fault: And yet they may have an equal Love to him, and an equal De&s;ire to recover him out of the Snare that he is fallen into.</P>
<P>And thus we &s;ee how that <HI>all the Children of God are under the governing Influence of the &s;ame Spirit, even the Spirit of God,</HI> and are animated and actuated in the general from the &s;ame di|vine and gracious Principle. And the many Differences and Oppo&s;itions that are among
<PB N="21" REF="005117_0016_1016A84F000A2990">tho&s;e, are no &s;ufficient Objection again&s;t this Doctrine. For the Differences and Di&s;&s;entions that are among them, are about le&s;&s;er Matters and not the e&s;&s;ential Points of Chri&s;tianity, and they ari&s;e from their Ignorance and Short-Sight|edne&s;s, their Prejudices of Education; or from the Remainders of Pride and Corruption, which God for wi&s;e and holy Ends &s;uffers to be among his Children in the pre&s;ent State.</P>
<P>So that abating the Remains of Sin and Cor|ruption in the Saints; and all that is nece&s;&s;ary to bring them to rights; that is to a regular uniform Way of thinking and acting, according to the uniform Operations of the Spirit, is to bring them to the &s;ame Knowledge and Under|&s;tanding of Things. For they having the &s;ame gracious Di&s;po&s;itions in their Hearts, if they knew as much, and tho't alike, they would manage alike. But becau&s;e they are weak and ignorant, they <HI>think as Children,</HI> and <HI>&s;peak as Children,</HI> and they &s;cuffle, and often-times quar|rel as Children. And they mu&s;t come to riper Years, to more Knowledge; yea, to Perfecti|on in Grace, before they will entirely put away tho&s;e <HI>childi&s;h Things.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude at pre&s;ent, and &s;o fini&s;h this Propo&s;ition, by making two or three <HI>practical Reflections.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. Since every Child of God is under the go|verning Influence of the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed Spirit in
<PB N="22" REF="005117_0017_1016A85392C43AD0">general; notwith&s;tanding the Differences that are among them: Surely <HI>we ought to be very cautious in judging and cen&s;uring tho&s;e who in &s;ome Points do differ from us.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing is more common than for Chri&s;tians to judge hardly of tho&s;e who differ from them, either in doctrinal or practical Points. For all are ready to think that <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Right</HI> are &s;o <HI>plainly</HI> on <HI>their</HI> Side, that they cannot think tho&s;e to be hone&s;t who di&s;&s;ent from them; but that they wilfully &s;hut their Eyes again&s;t the Light. This, I &s;ay, is commonly the Way of all Sides, and con&s;equently one Side, or both, mu&s;t needs be in the Wrong. Surely then it becomes all to be humble and mode&s;t wherein they differ, and not be ra&s;h in condemning all by Whole|&s;ale, who don't come into the &s;ame Sentiments, and the &s;ame Methods of Management with them. For &s;ome of tho&s;e that you thus judge, may, for ought you know, be under the Lead|ings of the &s;ame <HI>divine Spirit,</HI> and be governed by the &s;ame <HI>gracious Principle,</HI> and be the <HI>preci|cious Sons of Zion,</HI> as well as you.</P>
<P>And therefore before you judge hardly of any profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, as far as you can, what Spirit they appear to be governed by. But becau&s;e this lies very much out of your Sight, you mu&s;t take Care that you don't a&s;&s;ume the divine Prerogative.</P>
<P>In&s;tead therefore of your being &s;udden, and free in your judging of others, e&s;pecially as to
<PB N="23" REF="005117_0017_1016A85392C43AD0">their State, con&s;ider whether they don't appear to act from as good a Principle as you. And whether about tho&s;e Things wherein you agree they don't appear to be as much concerned for the Honour of God, and the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t as you. Whether they don't appear to hate <HI>Sin,</HI> and to love Holine&s;s, as much as you. And in &s;hort, Whether they don't appear as con&s;cientiou&s;ly careful to do the Will of God as you; and if &s;o, why then &s;hould you not think as charitably of them as of your &s;elves? Nay, and if they &s;hould be &s;o uncharitable as to cen&s;ure and condemn you, and altho' this &s;hould be contrary to the Word and Will of God, and &s;o &s;hould ari&s;e from their Ignorance, or remaining Corruption; yet you mu&s;t take Heed of judging and condemning them. For altho' ra&s;h judging be a Fault, yet the Ca&s;e may be &s;uch as that there may be &s;o much Ignorance, Mi&s;take and Prejudice in Men's Judgments, that their cen&s;uring and condemning others may not be incompatible with a State of Grace. <HI>Let not him that eateth, de&s;pi&s;e him that eateth not, and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth, for God hath received him</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.3, 4, 10, 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are many whom a proud, uncharitable World judge and condemn whom God will receive; for he &s;ees and knows they are go|vern'd by his Spirit: And many others who are
<PB N="24" REF="005117_0018_1016A855B4349408">applauded for eminent Saints will be rejected, becau&s;e Chri&s;t &s;ees they have nothing of the Spirit of God in them. <HI>Who art thou that judge&s;t another Man's Servant; to his own Ma&s;ter he &s;tandeth or falleth. Why do&s;t thou then judge they Brother? Or why do&s;t thou &s;et at nought thy Brother? We &s;hall all &s;tand before the Judgment-Seat of Chri&s;t. Let us not therefore judge one ano|ther any more.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We mu&s;t beware of abu&s;ing the Doctrine be|fore us, by indulging our &s;elves in Ignorance, or giving way to our Corruptions, flattering our &s;elves all the while, that we are in the General under the governing Influence of the Spirit of God.</HI></P>
<P>Many People are apt to imagine that they are led by the Spirit of God when they are not: And that altho' they differ from this, and the other, &amp; altho' they behave them&s;elves very much ami&s;s; yet they flatter them&s;elves, that all this is con&s;i&s;tent with their being <HI>led by the Spirit of God</HI> in general. But here Men mu&s;t beware that they don't deceive them&s;elves, as well as others in this Way. For you mu&s;t remember that Multitudes flatter them&s;elves that they are <HI>led by the Spirit of God,</HI> when they are really le&s;&s; by the Spirit of Ignorance, and this very often wilful and allowed Ignorance: Or with a Spi|rit of Error and Delu&s;ion: And this thro' Care|le&s;sne&s;s and Sloth, becau&s;e they will not take Pains to &s;earch out the Truth. Sometimes Men
<PB N="25" REF="005117_0018_1016A855B4349408">think they are in&s;pired with a flaming Zeal for the Glory of God, when perhaps it is all from a Spirit of Pride and Pa&s;&s;ion, or of a particular Party. And Per&s;ons are oftentimes thought to be Men of Steadine&s;s and Con&s;tancy, when perhaps there has been only a wilful and an ob|&s;tinate Spirit all the while. I &s;ay, many will flatter them&s;elves that they have a good Spirit, and that they do Things from an hone&s;t and gracious Principle, and out of Regard to God and Duty, when perhaps there was only &s;ome carnal, corrupt and wicked Principle at the Bottom.</P>
<P>For as the Devil can, and does &s;ometimes <HI>transform</HI> him&s;elf <HI>into an Angel of Light,</HI> &s;o by his &s;ubtle Devices Mens Lu&s;ts and irregular Pa&s;&s;ions will oftentimes &s;o transform them&s;elves as to appear like Vertues and Graces of the Spirit.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t therefore beware of being deceived this Way. And you mu&s;t con&s;ider that altho' there may be different Opinions, and hard Judg|ings, among God's own Children; yet that many, and I may &s;ay, mo&s;t of the religious Con|trover&s;ies and Differences, are among tho&s;e that have the lea&s;t of the Spirit of God; and very commonly among tho&s;e that have nothing at all of that good Spirit within them.</P>
<P>If therefore you would judge what Spirit you are of, and by what Spirit you are led, you mu&s;t &s;ee whether you can find tho&s;e uniform Influences of the Spirit, that are found in all
<PB N="26" REF="005117_0019_1016A859100DE0E8">good Men, and in which they all agree. You mu&s;t &s;ee whether there be that Sorrow for, and real Hatred of all Sin; whether there be an hearty Faith in Chri&s;t, and Dependance upon him, and Subjection to him. Whether there be that &s;incere and &s;upreme Love to God and Chri&s;t, and that fervent Love and Charity to our Neighbour, which the Spirit of God works in every Soul where he dwells.</P>
<P>And if you don't find the&s;e Things, you may depend upon it, that you have not the Spirit of God; how zealous &s;oever you may be for &s;ome Things in Religion, and how earne&s;tly &s;oever you may contend for them.</P>
<P>And let me tell you farther, that if the&s;e Operations of the Spirit which are found in every Child of God are very prevalent, they will prevent a great many of the unhappy Dif|ferences which are among Chri&s;tians. For the &s;harp Contentions that are among them are not from the Strength of their Graces, but from their Ignorance, Weakne&s;s, and remaining Cor|ruptions. And the more Grace Men have, the le&s;s Difference in their Opinions, be&s;ure le&s;s Difference in their Affection.

<P>_THE <HI>fir&s;t Propo&s;ition</HI> I have already &s;poken to, and &s;hewed <HI>that all the Children of God are led and govern'd by one and the &s;ame Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Under which I have told you, that the Spirit of God has been &s;triving with the Children of Men from the ear|lie&s;t Days, even before as well as &s;ince the Co|ming of Chri&s;t: And that there is no Child of God but what has experienced the gracious Influences of the divine Spirit upon his Soul: And that they are all in the General under the Influence of the &s;ame gracious Principle. That however they may differ in their Sentiments as to &s;ome particular <HI>Points of Doctrine,</HI> and what|ever Difference there may be in their <HI>Forms of publick Wor&s;hip,</HI> or in their Modes of <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> in the Church: And how hard|ly &s;oever they may judge, and how &s;everely &s;oever they may cen&s;ure each other; yet if they
<PB N="31" REF="005117_0021_1016A85EC8671F80">be the real Children of God, they have the &s;ame divine gracious Principle that they are, in the general, under the governing Influence of They, notwith&s;tanding all their Differences, and their Separations, are united to Chri&s;t, and united to one another, by one and the &s;ame Spirit. And I further &s;hew'd you, That altho' <HI>they</HI> did &s;o widely differ in their Sentiments up|on &s;ome particular Points, and in their Opinions of one another, and in their Practice relating to Modes of Di&s;cipline and Wor&s;hip; yet there were many uniform Operations of the Spirit upon their Souls, even the &s;ub&s;tantial Parts of Religi|on wherein they agreed. Such as <HI>Faith in God,</HI> and in the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;incere and &s;upreme <HI>Love</HI> of the divine Being, a Principle of <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Hatred</HI> of Sin, and of <HI>Subjection,</HI> and <HI>O|bedience</HI> to God, and of &s;incere and fervent <HI>Charity</HI> to their Fellow-Creatures. For as all the&s;e Things are nece&s;&s;ary to our being true Chri&s;tians, &s;o they are wrought in all of them by the Spirit of God. And all the unhappy Differences that are among them, ari&s;e from Ignorance and Weakne&s;s, from Prejudices of Education, from Pride, Self-will, and the Re|mains of other Lu&s;ts and Corruptions, which God for wi&s;e and holy Ends &s;uffers to be in his own Children. And I further ob&s;erved to you, That a &s;erious Thought upon the&s;e Things would correct a great deal of that uncharitable ra&s;h Judging that prevails in the World, and
<PB N="32" REF="005117_0022_1016A86322C9BF18">would prevent many of the fierce Contentions, the Separations and Divi&s;ions, which have rent and torn the Church of God to Pieces.</P>

<P>Prop. II. <HI>The &s;ure&s;t, and cleare&s;t Evidence of our being the Children of God, is our being</HI> LED <HI>and</HI> GOVERN'D <HI>by the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</HI> This is the very Thing that determines a profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tian to be a Child of God. If he be under the Influ|ence of a divine and gracious Principle, he is a Child of God, and will be &s;o owned and recei|ved by God, let the World think never &s;o hard|ly of him. On the other Hand, Let a Man make never &s;uch a fair Shew in Religion, let his Character run never &s;o high, let him be canonized as a mo&s;t excellent Saint; yet if he has not been led by the Spirit of God, if he has not been acted from a truly gracious Principle, God will never look upon him, or own him, as one of his Children, but will treat him as a <HI>Ba&s;tard,</HI> rather than as a <HI>Son.</HI></P>

<P>Indeed it may be &s;aid in &s;ome Re&s;pects, that we are all the Children of God. We are &s;o by Creation, for we derived our Beings from him, and in him we <HI>live</HI> and <HI>move.</HI> This the Hea|then were &s;en&s;ible of.

<P>But then there are &s;ome who are the Children of God by <HI>&s;pecial Grace.</HI> God of his meer Mercy and free Grace <HI>adopts</HI> &s;ome of the Chil|dren of Men for his Sons and his Daughters; whom he takes particular Notice of, and con|fers &s;pecial and peculiar Favours upon them, beyond what he does upon the re&s;t of Man|kind.</P>
<P>Now they are &s;uch SONS, &s;uch CHILDREN of God as tho&s;e which my Text &s;peaks of. And THOSE have mo&s;t glorious Privileges be|longing to them, and are truly in the mo&s;t hap|py State of any Men in the World. If the greate&s;t Monarch upon Earth &s;hould adopt you for his Son, and you &s;hould be the <HI>Heir,</HI> or the actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a Crown and Kingdom, or of all the Kingdoms of the World, the Riches, the Glories, and the Splendors of them, they would by no Means come up to the Honour, and Privilege, the Safety and Happine&s;s of one whom God has taken into his Family, and made one of his Children by <HI>Regeneration</HI> and <HI>Adoption,</HI> even altho' he &s;hould be never &s;o poor and low upon outward Accounts.</P>
<P>Here let me &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing</HI> HONOUR <HI>to be adopted, and received among the Children of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="005117_0023_1016A86748058720">
Is it any Honour to be de&s;cended from, or related to the Kings and Potentates of the World? How much greater Honour to be re|lated to the King of Heaven? What is the Ho|nour of being born of earthly Princes, to what it is to be born of God, to be born of the Spirit of God? Is it any Honour to be Partakers of the divine Nature, to have the Image of God upon our Souls, which con&s;i&s;ts in Knowledge, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Holine&s;s; and to be re&s;em|bling God in all his moral Perfections? Is it any Honour to be re&s;tored to the primitive Rectitude, Perfection, and Glory of the hu|mane Nature, which was but <HI>little lower than the Angels, crowned with Glory and Honour?</HI> Furthermore, Is it any Honour for God to own us as his Sons, and to give us Leave to call him Father, and to have the only <HI>begotten of the Fa|ther</HI> not a&s;hamed to call us <HI>Brethren?</HI> Or to treat us with Freedom and Friend&s;hip as &s;uch? Finally, Is it any Honour to be e&s;teemed, and loved, and honoured by God, and Chri&s;t, and all the Angels in Heaven, as the excellent Ones in all the Earth? Why!

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Children of God enjoy many</HI> DISTIN|GUISHING PRIVILEDGES AND ADVAN|TAGES <HI>in this World.</HI></P>
<P>God having of his free Grace adopted them into his Family, and number'd them among his
<PB N="36" REF="005117_0024_1016A868CD6273E0">Children, he &s;hews the Kindne&s;s, the Care, and Tenderne&s;s of a Father to them. He exerci&s;e his Wi&s;dom, his Power, and his Goodne&s;s, in contriving and bringing about Things for their Good, and in pre&s;erving, protecting and de|fending from the Evils of the World; or in &s;upporting them under them, or in &s;anctifying all unto them. <HI>As a Father pitieth his Children, &s;o the Lord pitieth them that fear him, for he knoweth our Frame,</HI> and <HI>remembreth that we are Du&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 103.13, 14.</NOTE>. The Children of God are pitied by their heavenly Father, under all their Weak|ne&s;&s;es and Infirmities, under all their Difficulties and Di&s;couragements he always &s;tands ready to &s;upport, to relieve, and help them.</P>
<P>God indeed &s;uffers them to meet with Trou|bles in the World, for many are the Afflictions of the Righteous, but then it is <HI>if need be that they are in Heavine&s;s;</HI> God &s;ees they need Af|flictions, and in Love, and in Kindne&s;s to their Souls, he afflicts them: But then it is in Mea|&s;ure, and in Mercy. The outward Troubles they meet with are not the furious, and re|vengeful Strokes of an Enemy who &s;eeks to kill and to de&s;troy; but the gentle Corrections of a wi&s;e and tender Father, that does not afflict willingly, nor grieve his Children.</P>
<P>And &s;uch Corrections as the&s;e are looked upon by the Apo&s;tle as Tokens of God's fa|therly
<PB N="37" REF="005117_0024_1016A868CD6273E0">Love, and a Sign that we are the Chil|dren of God. <HI>For whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;tneth, and &s;courgeth every Son whom he recei|veth.

<P>But now here is the peculiar Privilege of the Children of God, that tho' he vi&s;its their Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion with the <HI>Rod,</HI> and their Iniquity with <HI>Stripes,</HI> neverthele&s;s his <HI>Loving-kindne&s;s</HI> he will not take from them, nor &s;uffer his <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> to fail. But as it is their Profit that is aimed at by the Father of Spirits when he corrects, &s;o he takes Care to effect it, and turns all to their Advantage. For when he <HI>cha&s;tens,</HI> he <HI>teaches</HI> out of his Law, and cau&s;es the Rod and Reproof to give <HI>Wi&s;dom.</HI> He &s;anctifies every Stroke of his Rod, and cau&s;es it to <HI>purge</HI> away <HI>Iniquity,</HI> to <HI>wean</HI> them from the World, and to cure them of their <HI>Sloth,</HI> and to <HI>quicken</HI> them in the Ways of God. And &s;o altho' the Afflic|tion they meet with &s;eemeth for the pre&s;ent not <HI>joyous</HI> but <HI>grievous,</HI> in the End it will yield the <HI>peaceable</HI> Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. And every Child of God will be obliged in the Con|clu&s;ion to acknowledge with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>I
<PB N="38" REF="005117_0025_1016A86AC2352B98">know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in Faithfulne&s;s ha&s;t afflicted me</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 119.75.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But then as God is abundant in Goodne&s;s, and delights in Mercy, and does not afflict wil|lingly; &s;o this is the Privilege of all God's Chil|dren, that he is ready to &s;mile upon them, to pro&s;per and ble&s;s them upon outward Accounts &s;o far as he &s;ees they can bear it, and that it will be for their Good. <HI>Godline&s;s hath the Promi&s;e of the Life that now is, as well as of that which is to come</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 5.8.</NOTE>. And God accordingly ble&s;&s;es his Children with the good Things of this Life. They acknowledge him in all Ways, and he directs their Paths for them. He &s;miles upon them in their lawful Undertakings, and he gives them Power to get Wealth, and &s;urrounds them with the Bounties of his Providence. And &s;ome of them that he &s;ees can bear it, he cau&s;es Goodne&s;s and Mercy to follow them all their Days <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 23.6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But as the good Things of <HI>this Life</HI> are not the Portion that God provides for his Children, nor do they de&s;ire their Portion in the pre&s;ent World; &s;o it is not common for God's Chil|dren to abound with the Riches, and the great Things of this World.</P>
<P>But then here is the di&s;tingui&s;hing Privilege of the Children of God, that they are content
<PB N="39" REF="005117_0025_1016A86AC2352B98">and &s;atisfied with what their heavenly Father &s;ees cau&s;e to deal out to them; they are willing to be at his Di&s;po&s;e, having Food and Raiment they are content, <HI>and Godline&s;s with Contentment is great Gain</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 5.6.</NOTE>.

<P>Again, It is the di&s;tingui&s;hing Privilege of God's Children that they have <HI>free Liberty</HI> of <HI>acce&s;s</HI> with Confidence to God in Prayer, even as Children to a Father able and ready to help them.</P>

No Children can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o Welcome to their earthly Pa|rents, as the Children of God are to their hea|venly Father. And he is more ready to hear and an&s;wer, than they can be to a&s;k. And he is
<PB N="40" REF="005117_0026_1016A86E21FBCC70">able and ready to do, and will finally do for them <HI>exceeding abundantly</HI> above what they are able to a&s;k, or even to think. This is their happy Privilege that they may come freely and &s;pread their Ca&s;e before him, and make known their Reque&s;ts unto him, and God will hear and an|&s;wer all their Reque&s;ts for Things <HI>agreeable</HI> to his <HI>Will,</HI> and for their Good, and in as mud Mercy will deny them tho&s;e Things that will be hurtful unto them. And whatever they re|ceive in an&s;wer to their Prayers they are &s;ure to receive his Ble&s;&s;ing with it. So God ble&s;&s;es their Ble&s;&s;ings, and in &s;uch a qualified Sen&s;e cau&s;es what&s;oever they do to pro&s;per.</P>
<P>In a Word, The&s;e Children of God are the <HI>&s;pecial Care and charge of divine Providence,</HI> as well as the Subjects of his &s;pecial Grace. He is a tender careful Parent, watches over them by Night and by Day, to defend them from in|numerable Evils and Dangers that compa&s;s them about, unknown to them. And he gives his <HI>Angels</HI> charge concerning them, to encamp round about them; for they are all <HI>mini&s;tring Spirits</HI> &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter unto the&s;e Heirs of Salvation. He will make every Thing in Nature and Providence in&s;trumental of their Good, all his <HI>Paths</HI> will be <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> unto them. He will <HI>lead</HI> them in the <HI>Truth,</HI> and <HI>teach</HI> them, he will have <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> on tho&s;e of them that are <HI>Ignorant,</HI> and <HI>got out of the Way,</HI> he will <HI>reduce</HI> them from their Errors,

I now proceed to &s;peak as briefly to the &s;e|cond general Head, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>It is Matter of un&s;peakable Comfort to have a well-grounded Evidence in our &s;elves, that we are the Sons of God.</HI></P>
<P>For if there be &s;uch glorious Privileges be|longing to the Sons of God, &s;urely it mu&s;t be Matter of great Comfort to be well &s;atisfied upon a good Foundation, that we are among that happy Number. It is &s;afe and happy, to be the Children of God, whether we know it or no; but un&s;peakably more comfortable to our &s;elves, to be &s;atisfied of it in our own Minds.</P>
<P>Many flatter them&s;elves they are the Children of God, when they are not. And this Appre|hen&s;ion of them&s;elves quiets and comforts them, and &s;ometimes gives them con&s;iderable Joy; but now this is but a fal&s;e Peace, and the <HI>Joy of the Hypocrite, which is but for a Moment,</HI> and will i&s;&s;ue in dreadful Di&s;appointment. <HI>For what is the Hope</HI> of the &s;elf-flattering and &s;elf|deluding <HI>Hypocrite, when God taketh away his Soul?</HI> Moreover the Peace and Quietne&s;s that &s;uch Hypocrites have, from a vain Conceit of their being the Children of God, is exceeding dangerous, as it lulls them a&s;leep in carnal Se|curity, and thus their Delu&s;ion and Danger may not be di&s;cerned till it is too late to help the
<PB N="45" REF="005117_0028_1016A875470EEE38">Matter. And therefore it concerns all to ex|amine the Foundation of their Hopes, lea&s;t this &s;hould be their own unhappy Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Others again, who are the true Children of God; yet are very doubtful in their own Minds about it, and very jealous that they are &s;till in their carnal and corrupt E&s;tate. Nay, I believe I &s;hould offend again&s;t &s;ome of the Generation of God's Children, if I did not allow that they were &s;ometimes &s;o in the Dark as to their &s;pi|ritual State, as to conclude that they are in their Sins, that they are left out of the divine Fa|vour, and fearful whether ever they &s;hall find Mercy with God, and almo&s;t ready to &s;ink in|to De&s;pair.</P>
<P>And now this mu&s;t needs be a mo&s;t uncom|fortable and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing State, which not only takes off the Edge of all earthly Comforts; but deprives the Soul of inward Peace, and prevents the Plea&s;ure of &s;weet Communion with God, and fills the Soul with &s;uch fearful Apprehen&s;ions of divine Wrath, as even di&s;tracts it. <HI>While I &s;uffer thy Terrors I am di&s;tracted,</HI> &s;ays the holy P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 88.15.</P>
<P>But now to have clear &s;atisfying Evidence, upon a good Foundation, that we are the Chil|dren of God, and entitled to all their Privileges, Oh! what Peace, what Support, what Com|fort, what Joy mu&s;t this needs afford unto the Soul!</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="005117_0029_1016A87811D87370">
And now the Chri&s;tian's Evidences are upon a good Foundation, and his Hopes well groun|ded, when they ari&s;e from his finding that he has heartily <HI>received Chri&s;t,</HI> and that he has the Marks of the <HI>New-Birth</HI> upon him, and that he has received the <HI>Spirit of Adoption,</HI> whereby he cries <HI>Abba Father,</HI> and has the <HI>true Temper of a Child,</HI> and behaves in &s;ome Mea&s;ure with the <HI>Fear,</HI> the <HI>Honour,</HI> the <HI>Love,</HI> the <HI>Tru&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Sub|jection,</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> which becomes him to|wards his heavenly Father.</P>
<P>And the&s;e well-grounded Evidences ari&s;e in the Chri&s;tian's Soul, by a frequent and clo&s;e Ex|amination, a con&s;tant and critical Ob&s;ervation of him&s;elf; and the inward Frame and Temper of his Mind, together with the general Tenour of his Life. And the&s;e Evidences come to the Soul in the mo&s;t clear, convincing, and &s;atisfy|ing Manner, when the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> him&s;elf, is plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Saint in the Trial of him|&s;elf, and to &s;hine upon his own Work in the Soul, and enables the Saint clearly to di&s;cern it, and <HI>&s;o witne&s;&s;es together with his Spirit, that he is a Child of God,</HI> as in the 16th Ver&s;e of the Con|text.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it may be &s;aid, with Re&s;pect to the&s;e Evidences of Adoption, they are very various as to their Degree in Chri&s;tians: Some have much clearer and &s;tronger Evidences here|of than others. There is al&s;o a great Difference in the &s;ame Chri&s;tian at one Time and at ano|ther.
<PB N="47" REF="005117_0029_1016A87811D87370">Sometimes the Chri&s;tian's Evidences are &s;o beclouded, by the Remains of Sin, and the Hidings of God's Face, that he can hardly make out to him&s;elf that he is a Child of God, his Hopes do but ju&s;t preponderate his Doubts and Fears. At other Times the Chri&s;tian has &s;tronger and fuller Evidences, and does more clearly &s;ee the Marks of a Child of God upon him; &s;o that his Doubts and Fears are very much &s;cattered, and he has an inward Peace and Quietne&s;s of Mind ari&s;ing, and he walks up and down in the Light of God's Countenance, and there are &s;carce any Clouds in the Way. At other Times the&s;e Evidences are &s;till further cleared up, &s;o as not only to give a &s;atisfactory Proof to the Soul, that he is a Child of God, but to remove all Doubts, to &s;catter every Cloud, and to give him the <HI>full A&s;&s;urance of Faith and of Hope</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 6.11,&mdash;22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And now the well-grounded Evidence of our being the Children of God in the lowe&s;t, but e&s;pecially in the highe&s;t Degree, mu&s;t needs afford great Comfort and Satisfaction to the Soul. For as it is our highe&s;t Privilege, and our greate&s;t Happine&s;s to be the Children of God; &s;o every truly thoughtful and con&s;iderate Mind will be concerned to be well &s;atisfied that this is his own happy Ca&s;e, and the clear Evi|dence of it, will afford the greate&s;t Comfort to
<PB N="48" REF="005117_0030_1016A879F2CB3C20">him, at all Times, in all Ca&s;es, and under every Circum&s;tance, and Condition of Life. As for the &s;tupid and thoughtle&s;s Part of Mankind, who are immer&s;ed in the Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e, and &s;wallowed up with the Vanities of the World, &s;ome earthly and &s;en&s;ual Enjoyment may plea&s;e them better for the pre&s;ent, than the cleare&s;t Evidences of their being the Sons of God would do. But with every one that is a Child of God, it is not &s;o. For while the <HI>many</HI> are enquiring <HI>who will &s;hew us any worldly Good,</HI> the Language of the gracious Soul, is, <HI>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon me; and that gives him more Joy and Gladne&s;s than when Corn, or Wine, or Oyl are increa&s;ed</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 4.6, 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Here it may be &s;aid, that even in the Mid&s;t of outward Pro&s;perity, there is nothing affords &s;uch Comfort to the gracious Soul, as the Evi|dence that he is a Child of God. For whil&s;t the Chri&s;tian is very jealous whether he be a Child of God or no, and his Doubts and Fears prevail above his Hopes, he will be naturally led to fear whether the&s;e outward good Things are the Fruit of God's fatherly Love. He will be afraid lea&s;t the&s;e earthly Goods &s;hould be all his Portion, lea&s;t they &s;hould be attended with a Cur&s;e, lea&s;t they &s;hould prove a Trap and a Snare to him, and be like <HI>the Pro&s;perity of Fools which de&s;troys them</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. 1.32.</NOTE>. And altho' this may be
<PB N="49" REF="005117_0030_1016A879F2CB3C20">very &s;erviceable to the Chri&s;tian, and make him cautious how he meddles too much, or plunges him&s;elf too deep in worldly Hurries, and Cares, or Plea&s;ures; yet it deprives him of much of that Comfort which otherwi&s;e he might enjoy in the good Things that God confers upon him.</P>
<P>But now the Man who has a &s;atisfactory Evi|dence that he is a Child of God, in what an agreable Manner is he ready to receive the Fruits of divine Bounty? He receives them as the Tokens of God's Favour, and as the Effects of his Covenant-Love, and of his fatherly Care and Goodne&s;s; and as what he expects God will ble&s;s unto him, and what he can confident|ly a&s;k a Ble&s;&s;ing upon; which &s;erves to enlarge his Heart towards his heavenly. Father, and cau&s;es him to receive the divine Mercies thank|fully, and quickens him to greater Chearfulne&s;s in God's Service, and puts him upon improving what he receives more faithfully, to the Glory of the Giver.</P>
<P>But then, on the other Hand, when Per&s;ons are under <HI>Troubles</HI> and <HI>Afflictions, Difficulties</HI> and <HI>Sorrows,</HI> what is there that can afford them &s;uch <HI>Support</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> as the <HI>good Evidence</HI> that they are the <HI>Children of God?</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>For the clear Evidence hereof will at once &s;ugge&s;t to them, that all their Afflictions are on|ly the wi&s;e and whole&s;ome Corrections of their heavenly Father, that are de&s;igned for, and will finally prove, very advantageous to them, to
<PB N="50" REF="005117_0031_1016A87CCD6F3D50"><HI>purge away their Iniquity,</HI> and to <HI>take away their Sin,</HI> and to <HI>make them Partakers of the divine Ho|line&s;s.</HI> And how wonderfully will the realizing Tho't and Belief hereof reconcile Chri&s;tians to every Affliction they meet withal? This will help them to &s;ubmit to them quietly, and bear them patiently, being per&s;waded, that how grievous &s;o|ever they are at pre&s;ent, yet that in the End they will <HI>yield the peaceable Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> What Support mu&s;t the Children of God have from their being &s;atisfied they are &s;uch, under all their Trials; even under the fore&s;t of them, to think that their heavenly Father &s;ends them in Love, and in Mercy to their Souls, that he does not afflict them willingly, but only becau&s;e he &s;ees they have Need of them, and that he will &s;anctify every &s;troke of his Rod, and cau&s;e <HI>the&s;e light Afflictions, which are but for a Moment, to work out for them a far more exceeding &amp; an eternal Weight of Glory?</HI></P>
<P>Here for In&s;tance, are any of the Children of God, <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>low</HI> in the World? Why the &s;a|tisfactory Evidence that they are his Children, mu&s;t needs afford great Support and Comfort to them under all their Poverty, and will enable them to apply the Words of the Apo&s;tle to them|&s;elves, and draw Comfort from them, Jam. 2.5. <HI>Hearhen, my beloved Brethren, hath not God cho&s;en the Poor of this World, rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promi&s;ed to them that love him?</HI> Again,</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="005117_0031_1016A87CCD6F3D50">
Have you met with Lo&s;&s;es and Cro&s;&s;es? Have you lo&s;t your E&s;tate, or le&s;t your Friends, your Parents, your Children, your Hu&s;band, or your Wife, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> Why if you are but well per|&s;waded that you are the Children of God, and that he is your Friend and Father, this mu&s;t needs be great Comfort to you, for you may comfort your &s;elves with this, that tho' your earthly Parents for&s;ake you, yet your heavenly Father <HI>will take you up;</HI> and that tho' all your Friends die and leave you, yet that <HI>your Re|deemer liveth,</HI> who can and will be infinitely more to you, than Father, or Mother, or Bro|ther, or Si&s;ter, or Wife, or Children, or Hou&s;es, or Lands.</P>
<P>Again, Are you under bodily Sickne&s;&s;es and and Pains? Why the Per&s;wa&s;ion that you are the Children of God, will comfort you, and quiet you under them; as it will lead you to think, how much Pain and Sorrow Chri&s;t en|dured for your Sakes, and that he will at length give you Ea&s;e and Re&s;t from all your Troubles, and bring you to that ble&s;&s;ed State where there will be no more Sickne&s;s nor Pain, and where all Tears will be wiped away from your Eyes for ever.</P>
<P>Again, Are you defamed? Are you un|charitably judged and cen&s;ured as a great Sinner, as a carnal unconverted Man, and are many Anathe mas denounced again&s;t you? Why if you have but this Te&s;timony that you have
<PB N="52" REF="005117_0032_1016A880BA812858">plea&s;ed God, and that you belong to his Chil|dren, <HI>that</HI> is enough to &s;upport you under all the uncharitable Tho'ts, the hard Speeches, and the ill Treatment you may meet withal, for then you may comfort your&s;elves with what our Saviour &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, Mat. 5.10, 11. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they which are per&s;ecuted for Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s Sake, for their's is the Kingdom of Heaven.

<P>Thus the &s;ecret Witne&s;s, or clear Evidence that we are the Children of God, would be a &s;upporting refre&s;hing Cordial to us, under the heavie&s;t Trials of Life. But now what will the Man do when he is &s;urrounded with Tribu|lations and Trials of every Kind, and has no Evidence that God is his Friend and Father, but fears and concludes the contrary? What Support can he have under his Troubles, when he concludes they all come in a Way of Judg|ment, and becau&s;e God is angry with him; and the&s;e appear to be but the Beginning of Sorrows? Oh how in&s;upportable mu&s;t &s;uch Tho'ts as the&s;e be! And no Wonder if he &s;hould &s;ink under the Weight of them into Im|patience, Di&s;content, Murmurings, and even De&s;pair.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> What is there which can afford &s;uch <HI>Support</HI> and <HI>Comfort</HI> in a <HI>dying Hour,</HI> as the clear <HI>well-grounded Evidence</HI> that we are the Children of God?</P>

As the Reality of this is the only Thing to take away the Sting of Death, &s;o the full Per|&s;wa&s;ion of this in our own Minds is the only Thing to take away the Terrors of Death, and reconcile us to the Tho't of Dying. For if we be not &s;atisfied that we are the Children of God, we can't be &s;atisfied of our good E&s;tate. And how awful, how terrible mu&s;t it needs be, to &s;ee Death approaching in good Earne&s;t, and we ju&s;t launching into the Ocean of Eternity, and be very doubtful which Way we are going, whether into a happy or mi&s;erable Eternity!

Man had by his Sin and Rebellion, ca&s;t him|&s;elf out of the Favour of God, and de&s;erved to be treated as a Rebel and a Traitor, in&s;tead of being admitted to the Priviledges of a Son. By Sin we di&s;owned and rejected God from being our God and Father, and he might have utterly di&s;owned us from being his Children. We lo&s;t the Reverence and Dutifulne&s;s of Children, and he might have utterly withdrawn the tender Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion of a Father from us, and &s;o might have rejected us and ca&s;t us off forever.</P>
<P>But now for God, in&s;tead of dealing with us after &s;uch a Manner, to &s;hew a Father's Pity to us, and to find out, and to bring about, a Way whereby we might be re&s;tored to all the Privi|leges of the Sons of God, it mu&s;t needs be won|derful Love and Grace in God.</P>
<P>But then the divine Love appears more con|&s;picious, and more amazing, when we con&s;ider the Method which God took, to bring us into &s;uch a near and happy Relation to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus in order to our becoming the Sons, the adopted Sons of God, he &s;ent HIS ONLY BE|GOTTEN AND DEARLY BELOVED SON, e|ven the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to &s;uffer the deepe&s;t Humiliations, the greate&s;t Sorrows, and the mo&s;t cur&s;ed Death, who afterwards aro&s;e from the Dead, a&s;cended up into Heaven, where he ever lives at the right Hand of the Father, to make Interce&s;&s;ion for us.

<Q>If there be &s;uch ab&s;olute A&s;&s;ur|ance as to be no Doubt nor Danger, there is no Place nor Room for Examination, or far|ther Endeavours to make it &s;urer than it is.</Q> And therefore &s;uch as talk of their being as &s;ure of their Salvation as of the Death of Chri&s;t; yea as &s;ure of their Salvation as of their own Exi&s;tence; they &s;hew that they are carried a|way by a rapturous Pa&s;&s;ion or vain Conceit, rather than governed by a &s;olid Judgment.</P>
<P>But then altho' we cannot attain to Perfection of A&s;&s;urance, any more than we can attain to Perfection of Grace; yet we are to be &s;triving after it, and pre&s;&s;ing towards it, as we are to be &s;triving after the Perfection of Grace.

<P>There is nothing &s;o much worth our making &s;ure as this: Nothing which will afford &s;uch real Comfort and Satisfaction to the Soul, or
<PB N="62" REF="005117_0037_1016A89001DCF1A8">that will help us to conduct and behave proper|ly under all the Changes of Life, as the &s;ati&s;|factory Evidence that we are among the Sons of God. This will help us to receive outward Comforts as the Tokens of God's fatherly Love and Goodne&s;s: This will help us to receive Af|flictions as the wi&s;e and whole&s;ome Corrections of our heavenly Father, de&s;igned for our Profit. And this is what will afford &s;piritual Support and Comfort to us at the Approach of Death. Oh what a Cordial in a dying Hour, to be &s;ati&s;|fied in our own Minds that we are the Children of God, and &s;o Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chri&s;t to the Inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, re&s;erved in Heaven for us! This will &s;catter the Fears of Death, and reconcile us to that which even Nature abhors; being per&s;wa|ded that to be ab&s;ent from the Body will be to be pre&s;ent with the Lord. What is it that we hear People wi&s;hing and longing for on a Death-Bed, but that they might have fuller Evidences that they are the Children of God? And their Language is, if they were but clear in this, they &s;hould be willing to die whenever God calls; and all their Unea&s;ine&s;s, their Fear and Di&s;tre&s;s of Mind, ari&s;e from their Doubts and Uncer|tainties whether they are the Children of God or no; and all the World would they give if they had it, to be a&s;&s;ured of this one Point.

Oh then let us not &s;pare any Labour or Pains to get a well-grounded Per&s;wa&s;ion that we belong to God, and have an Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

And we ought to be &s;triving after the highe&s;t Degrees of A&s;&s;urance that we are capable of in this pre|&s;ent State.</P>
<P>But here is a Caution nece&s;&s;ary to be laid in, <HI>viz.</HI> That you don't work your &s;elves up into a vain Confidence and a Sort of A&s;&s;urance in your own Minds, when there is no real Foun|dation for it. This is the Way that many a poor Soul has been impo&s;ed upon. Per&s;ons have been eagerly de&s;irous of A&s;&s;urance; e&s;pe|cially &s;uch as have been led to &s;uch a fal&s;e and dangerous Doctrine, <HI>That A&s;&s;urance was of the E&s;&s;ence of &s;aving Faith,</HI> and &s;o in&s;tead of &s;tri|ving after a Faith of A&s;&s;ent, a Faith of Con|&s;ent, a Faith of Reliance, and a Faith of Sub|jection to Chri&s;t; they leap over all the&s;e, to work them&s;elves up into a Faith of A&s;&s;urance. And when they thus come to feel a Per&s;wa&s;ion in their Minds that Chri&s;t is theirs, then they imagine they have attained &s;aving Faith, and are a&s;&s;ured of their Salvation. But Oh how often
<PB N="64" REF="005117_0038_1016A8926D798678">is &s;uch an A&s;&s;urance as this built upon the Sand, that will never endure the Trial!

<P>II Prop. <HI>_THE &s;ure&s;t and cleare&s;t Mark of our being the Children of God is our being led and govern'd by</HI> HIS SPIRIT.</P>
<P>For the illu&s;trating this Propo&s;ition I have &s;aid,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That it is our highe&s;t Privilege, and greate&s;t Happine&s;s to be the Children of God.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="66" REF="005117_0039_1016A8969B7F46B0">
And now for further Illu&s;tration I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>That there are many Things which Men are apt to take up with as Signs and Tokens of their being the Children of God, which are fal&s;e, at lea&s;t very uncertain, and by no Means to be depended upon.</HI></P>
<P>There are &s;carce any Per&s;ons &s;o abandoned, but they are concerned at &s;ome Times about their future State, and de&s;irous to be number'd and found among the Children of God; and there are few, but what hope this is their Ca&s;e; but alas nothing is more common than for Per|&s;ons to build their Hopes upon the Sand, and to take up with fal&s;e, at lea&s;t very uncertain Signs and Tokens of their being the Children of God. Men who are careful enough in their &s;ecular Affairs, to be upon a good Bottom in all their Concerns with Men, which are but Trifles: Will be oftentimes &s;atisfied with very &s;lender, uncertain Marks of their Adoption, which is of infinite Importance and Concern unto them.</P>
<P>And now Men's flattering them&s;elves with fal&s;e Hopes, and taking up with uncertain Marks, is owing very much to their Ignorance, to their Pride, to their Education, to &s;ome fal&s;e Doctrines they have imbib'd, and as much, if not more than any Thing, to their not ha|ving their Hearts affected with tho&s;e Things, and &s;o are very carele&s;s about the Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="005117_0039_1016A8969B7F46B0">
Now what I propo&s;e at this Time is to men|tion &s;everal of tho&s;e Marks and Tokens of be|ing the Children of God, that Per&s;ons are very apt to &s;et down &s;atisfied and contented with, which are indeed fal&s;e, or at lea&s;t very uncer|tain Marks of our being the Children of God.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t be&s;eech your diligent At|tention and clo&s;e Self-Application, that you may &s;ee how far you have been depending upon tho&s;e Marks, and whether you have any better to build your Hopes upon.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some flatter them&s;elves that they are the Children of God, becau&s;e they are de&s;cended from them that were &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>That becau&s;e their Parents were pious, and had an Intere&s;t in the &s;pecial Grace and Favour of God, they feed them&s;elves with Hopes that God has a &s;pecial Love for them al&s;o.</P>
<P>It was a very common Thing for the Chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to allot upon great Privileges, becau&s;e they were the Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the Friend of God. They con&s;ider'd them|&s;elves as the Children of the Covenant that God made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> and looked upon all the Ble&s;&s;ings conferred on him to be entail'd on them, without taking Care to be Followers of him in Faith and Obedience. They were ready to think that God would be their God and Father, becau&s;e he was their Father's God, whether they loved and &s;erved the God of their Fathers or no.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="005117_0040_1016A899B78132B0">
And this is very much the Temper of &s;ome profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, they flatter them&s;elves that becau&s;e they have de&s;cended from godly Ance&s;tors, they &s;hall fare the better for it: That they &s;hall be beloved for their Father's Sake: And that becau&s;e God was their Fa|ther's or their Mother's God, he will be their God and Father al&s;o.</P>
<P>And altho' Per&s;ons would not own it per|haps if the Matter was put to them; yet I doubt not but that there are many, who de|pend upon finding Favour with God, and have nothing better to ground their Hopes upon, than that they de&s;cended of godly Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>But now this is a fal&s;e and un&s;afe Ground to go upon; for Grace don't run in the Blood. Happy indeed is it when God is plea&s;ed to cau&s;e his Grace to de&s;cend from Father to Son, and &s;o from Generation to Generation, which was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Timothy</HI> and his Ance&s;tors, which the Apo&s;tle takes Notice of with Plea&s;ure, that the unfeigned Faith that was in his <HI>Grandmother</HI> Lois, <HI>and in his Mother</HI> Eunice, was <HI>in him al&s;o</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 1.5.</NOTE>. But tho' there may be many &s;uch In&s;tances among us; yet this is not to be de|pended upon. God when he adopts a Per&s;on into his Family and among his Children, don't oblige him&s;elf to adopt his Po&s;terity with him. And if it &s;hould be &s;aid, that God generally
<PB N="69" REF="005117_0040_1016A899B78132B0">takes &s;ome of the Children of religious Parents into his &s;pecial Favour; yet it may al&s;o be &s;aid, that it is not common for all to be adopted by him. Seldom as to a particular Family that the Prophecy of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> is accompli&s;hed, 54.13. <HI>And</HI> ALL <HI>thy Children &s;hall be taught of the Lord,</HI> that is &s;piritually and &s;avingly taught. For what is more common that to &s;ee profane and wicked Children in the Hou&s;es of godly Parents? <HI>I&s;aac</HI> had a profane <HI>E&s;au</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12.26.</NOTE>, <HI>Eli</HI> was a good Man, but his Sons made them&s;elves vile <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.13.</NOTE>.

<P>So that there is no Dependance upon our being de&s;cended from godly Parents; for altho' God has &s;aid, <HI>that his Mercy is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting upon them that fear him, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s unto Children's Children;</HI> yet it is only <HI>to &s;uch as keep his Covenant, and that remem|ber his Commandments to do them</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 103.17, 18.</NOTE>. Wherefore my Advice to you is the &s;ame with what <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> gave to the Sadduces and Phari&s;ees that came to be baptized of him, <HI>Bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, and think not to &s;ay within your &s;elves,</HI> WE HAVE ABRAHAM TO

<P N="2">2. <HI>Some have great Dependance upon their Knowledge in religious Matters, and upon the &s;up|po&s;ed Soundne&s;s of their Faith, and Orthodoxne&s;s of their Principles.</HI></P>
<P>Some Men have much greater Knowledge in &s;piritual Matters than others, they have an Opportunity to read, an Inclination to Study, and a Capacity to under&s;tand beyond others: And it is not an uncommon Thing for Per&s;ons to mi&s;take their thir&s;t after the Knowledge of &s;piritual Points, for De&s;ires after true Grace, and their Attainments in the Knowledge of &s;piritual Truths, for the Attainment of &s;aving Grace. Their Under&s;tandings are enlarged a|bout divine and &s;piritual Things, by Reading and Study; and becau&s;e this affords &s;ome Plea|&s;ure to their comtemplative and &s;tudious Minds
<PB N="71" REF="005117_0041_1016A89B4A6E3A20">they are apt to think they are truly in love with Religion, and that there is a gracious Impre&s;&s;ion made upon their Hearts; whereas the Plea&s;ure they take therein is no other than they would take in any other Science they &s;hould happen to get their Minds engaged in. And this is a Danger that Mini&s;ters, Scholars, and other &s;tu|dious Men are expo&s;ed unto. They are in danger of mi&s;taking the &s;peculative Under&s;tand|ing of the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, for a &s;piri|tual &s;aving Acquaintance with them. Some who have been well in&s;tructed in the Doctrines concerning God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &s;o that they can di&s;cour&s;e learnedly, ingeniou&s;ly and judiciou&s;ly of the Perfections of God, of the Per&s;on and Offices of Chri&s;t; they conclude they have that Knowledge of God and Chri&s;t which will be Life eternal to them. If they can di&s;cour&s;e well upon the Nature of Regene|ration and Conver&s;ion, they are ready from thence to flatter them&s;elves that they are con|verted. If they can de&s;cribe the Nature of Faith and Repentance, they fancy that they them&s;elves repent and believe. And &s;uch as are celebrated for their Knowledge about the&s;e Things, and if they are greatly e&s;teemed for their being &s;ound in their Principles, and free from the Errors that others are charged with, and are re&s;orted to for Coun&s;el and Advice in Matters of a &s;piritual Nature, they are in dan|ger
<PB N="72" REF="005117_0042_1016A89FEDA91E10">of thinking too highly of them&s;elves with Re&s;pect to their &s;piritual State.</P>
<P>Moreover, Per&s;ons of low Education if by any Means there be &s;ome new Di&s;covery made to them, of &s;ome &s;peculative Point in Divinity, they are &s;ometimes apt to take it for a &s;piritual &s;aving Illumination; yea when a Doctrine that they have known very well before; yet by in being &s;et forth after a different Manner, and in a new Light, they have been ready to conclude that then has been the Time that God has o|pened their Eyes in a &s;aving Manner.</P>
<P>Finally, Here it is no uncommon Thing for Per&s;ons upon their changing their Thoughts and Notions in &s;ome Points of Divinity, to mi&s;take it for a Change of their Hearts. They are convinced that they were in an Error in &s;ome particular Point and now embrace the other Side for the Truth, and from hence will date their Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>But now the&s;e Things are by no Means certain Signs or Tokens of our being the Chil|dren of God. For altho' Knowledge in &s;piri|tual Matters, and right Notions in Points of Religion are very de&s;ireable, and in &s;ome Sort nece&s;&s;ary Helps to our being truly religious; yet they are not true Religion it &s;elf, nor are they certain Signs of it.</P>
<P>A Man may have great Attainments in Knowledge, and be able to di&s;cour&s;e excellently well upon all Points of Divinity, and be very

They remember the Sabbath-day, and keep it externally holy; they go to the Hou&s;e of God, and to the Table of the Lord, and are con&s;tant in tho&s;e external publick Duties; and be&s;ides the&s;e keep up the Religion of the Family, and of the Clo&s;et, ob&s;erving their Mor|ning and Evening Sacrifices with the Hou&s;hold, and by them&s;elves apart; and many Per&s;ons have great Dependance upon the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>But alas, the&s;e are very uncertain Things for Per&s;ons to depend upon: For Men may go this Length, and be very exemplary upon the&s;e Ac|counts, and yet all may be nothing, no Evi|dence of their being the Children of God. For altho' a publick Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t is a great Duty, and &s;uch as live in the carele&s;s Neglect hereof have no Rea&s;on to think they are the Children of God, and little Ground to depend on the divine Favour while they go on in &s;uch Neglect; yet this is no &s;ure Sign that we are in Favour with God, and among his Children. We mu&s;t confe&s;s him before Men, for &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>He that confe&s;&s;eth me before Men, him

<P>It is no uncommon Thing for tho&s;e who are Strangers to true Grace in their Hearts, to find them&s;elves in very different Frames while they are attending religious Duties.

<P>There are but few who have been favoured with the free U&s;e of the Go&s;pel, and with a re|light Education; but what have been awaken|ed into &s;ome Concern of Soul, and have had
<PB N="79" REF="005117_0045_1016A8A9C762D6B0">&s;ome Convictions &s;tirred up in them, either by the Workings of natural Con&s;cience, or by the common Motions of the Spirit of God, &s;tirred up in them, upon &s;ome particular Occa&s;ions. Thus Times of Sickne&s;s, and of &s;ore Affliction; and Times of imminent Hazard and Danger, frequently are the Occa&s;ion of &s;uch Convictions. Moreover the falling into gro&s;s and &s;candalous Sins, will oftentimes &s;tir up Con&s;cience &s;o as to la&s;h the Man very &s;everely, and give him mo&s;t dreadful Twinges, not only for the Sin he has ju&s;t fallen into, but for other Sins al&s;o, which by this Means are bro't to his Remembrance.</P>
<P>And there are al&s;o other Times that Per&s;ons may be under Convictions, when there can be no external Cau&s;e offered for it; and the&s;e Convictions may &s;ometimes run to a very high Degree, &s;o that their Sins will &s;tare them in the Face, and the Wrath of God they will &s;ee hanging over them, and they are in great Per|plexity and Concern about their eternal State, and in great Di&s;tre&s;s le&s;t they &s;hould &s;uddenly drop into the devouring Lake of Hell. And they may, at &s;uch Times, be full of their Con|fe&s;&s;ions and Acknowledgments, both to God and Man; acknowledging they are &s;ome of the Chief of Sinners, and will freely &s;peak of their Pride, their Hypocrify, their Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and their Carnality; and will be a&s;king Forgiv|ne&s;s where they have offended, and will have many Purpo&s;es, and be making many Promi&s;es

<P>Now the&s;e Things Men are apt to depend upon, and to date their Conver&s;ion from &s;ome &s;uch Times as the&s;e; and when they think or are que&s;tioned about their Conver&s;ion, they will look back to &s;ome &s;uch Sea&s;on of Conviction, and quiet them&s;elves with it.</P>
<P>But now this is no certain Sign of Regenera|tion and Conver&s;ion, and Per&s;ons may go thus far without any thoro' &s;aving Change: For tho' there be no Conver&s;ion without Conviction, yet there may be Conviction without Conver&s;i|on. Convictions may be meerly from the Ac|cu&s;ations of Con&s;cience, from the Fear of Death, from the Apprehen&s;ions of divine Wrath, and the Terrors of Hell, without any real Love to God, or Faith in Chri&s;t; and they may be only &s;udden Pangs, rai&s;ed by the Ap|prehen&s;ion of a pre&s;ent Danger, that go off with the Fright. Thus <HI>Pharaoh</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> when the Judgments of God fell heavy upon him, he had &s;ome Conviction, and ac|knowledged that he had &s;inned, and intreated <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to pray for him; but the particular Judgment was no &s;ooner removed, but his Heart was hardned again. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 9.27, 28.</NOTE> So the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were greatly affected at the Terrors and Glories of Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> when the Law

<P>As it is not an uncommon Thing for Per|&s;ons who have no true Grace, to have &s;ome Sor|row and Remor&s;e for Sin; &s;o neither is it for them to have a con&s;iderable deal of Joy. Per|&s;ons may pa&s;s out of deep Sorrow, into high
<PB N="82" REF="005117_0047_1016A8AF725C3258">Degrees of Joy; and from being in De&s;pair, to a Sort of full A&s;&s;urance.

<P N="7">7. <HI>Some have great Dependance upon their Reformation as to &s;ome particular Vices.</HI></P>
<P>A partial Reformation is no uncommon Thing among tho&s;e who are yet in their State of Unregeneracy. There are &s;ome Vices that &s;ome Sinners more ea&s;ily reform and refrain from. Thus tho&s;e Sins and Follies that youth|ful Age is &s;ubject to, are frequently reformed, when Per&s;ons come to riper Years. Other Sins there are that Per&s;ons refrain from, meerly for Want of the &s;ame Opportunities and Tempta|tions which they had before; and this they take for real Reformation, whereas their Hearts are much the &s;ame. Some again refrain from this and the other Vice, from prudent, political, worldly Con&s;iderations. They find that they impair their Health, bring on Pain and Sickne&s;s, and hinder them from other worldly Enjoy|ments, and tend to &s;horten Life; and from the&s;e Con&s;iderations they refrain. Others again ab&s;tain from this and the other Vice, becau&s;e it wa&s;ts their Effects, and their Circum&s;tances won't allow it. And others becau&s;e it hurts their Character, and will bring on Di&s;grace, or hinder their Promotion. But now you may ea&s;ily &s;ee how little the&s;e are to be depended upon. For if Men only reform as to &s;ome
<PB N="84" REF="005117_0048_1016A8B2808BE480">Sins, and yet live in others; it is a Sign there is no true Grace in the Heart, and that &s;uch a Soul has not pa&s;&s;ed thro' a regenerating Change: For where there is true Grace, there will be the breaking with every Sin. The Language of a truly gracious Soul is that of the P&s;almi&s;t, 119.128. <HI>I e&s;teem</HI> ALL <HI>thy Precepts concerning</HI> ALL <HI>Things to be right, and I hate</HI> EVERY <HI>fal&s;e Way.</HI> Yea, there mu&s;t be a departing from <HI>our own Iniquity,</HI> if we would give a &s;ure Sign of <HI>our Uprightne&s;s before God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 18.23.</NOTE>.

<P N="8">8. <HI>Others again have great Dependance upon their being ju&s;t, and true, and hone&s;t in their Deal|ings, as a certain Mark of their being in a State of Grace.</HI></P>
<P>There are many Per&s;ons in the World, whom if you &s;hould a&s;k them, what Rea&s;on they had to think they were the Children of God, or what they grounded their Hopes of Heaven and Happine&s;s upon? Would an&s;wer, That they have never wronged any Man (as they know of) in their Lives, that they have dealt fairly and ju&s;tly with all Men, that they have been careful to pay their Dues both publick and private.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="005117_0048_1016A8B2808BE480">
And now this, if it be true, is an excellent Thing, and it is what the Go&s;pel teaches and requires, and wherever the Spirit of God comes it always works &s;uch a ju&s;t and hone&s;t Princi|ple in the Soul, which will put the Man that is under the Influence of it, upon dealing ju&s;tly with all Men, and &s;peaking the Truth to his Neighbour; and without this it is in vain for a Man to pretend to be a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>But now a Man's being fair and hone&s;t in his Dealings is of it &s;elf, by no Means to be depended upon. For this may be owing, partly to a Sort of native Simplicity that &s;ome Men have; or it may be partly from the Manner of their Education, where they have never &s;een the Way of the World, and the hid|den Things of Di&s;hone&s;ty, that are practi&s;ed in it; or it may be from a political Con&s;idera|tion, governing them&s;elves by that common and good Maxim, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Hone&s;ty is the be&s;t Policy.</HI> Per&s;ons may be very fair and hone&s;t in their Dealings, merely for the Sake of gain|ing Credit and Cu&s;tom, and &s;o of enlarging their Bu&s;ine&s;s and their Income, without any Regard to God, or their Duty therein; but on|ly as the mo&s;t likely Means of promoting their worldly Intere&s;t. And &s;o it may be &s;aid, that &s;ome People are fair in their Dealings, from the &s;ame Views that others are unfair and di&s;hone&s;t, meerly to get more of the World, either of the Prai&s;e or of the Profit of the World. And
<PB N="86" REF="005117_0049_1016A8B57A3B7880">here, altho' I do by no Means put the hone&s;t and the di&s;hone&s;t Man upon a Level; yet it is po&s;&s;ible they may both be acted from the &s;ame carnal and worldly Principle; even a De&s;ire to get the World. One takes this Way, the other takes that Way, to increa&s;e his worldly Goods; and as for any Regard to God and their Duty, they don't come into Con&s;ideration by either of them.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Some have great Dependance upon their ge|nerous and charitable Practices, as Marks of their being the Children of God; but they are, by them|&s;elves, very uncertain ones.</HI></P>
<P>Some Men appear to have a great deal of Ge|nero&s;ity in their Tempers; they &s;eem to be of a loving friendly Di&s;po&s;ition. They will &s;ay that they owe no Man any ill Will, and it don't appear that they do: We &s;hall find them very neighbourly, and ready to any Acts of Kindne&s;s that any about them &s;tand in need of. They appear tender hearted, and compa&s;&s;ionate to tho&s;e in Di&s;tre&s;s, and will often go a great Way in giving Relief unto them; lending, or giving, a&s;&s;i&s;ting, and defending them, as their Ca&s;es call for, and as they have Ability. And we may &s;ee they do many generous Actions, en|couraging Acts of Charity, not only by their Words, but by their Example; and will &s;hew very much of a publick Spirit, promoting Things that tend to the publick Good, and will &s;corn to
<PB N="87" REF="005117_0049_1016A8B57A3B7880">do any Thing that appears mean, and little, and &s;tingy.</P>
<P>And now this is a very lovely Temper, and recommends Per&s;ons to the E&s;teem and Delight of all that know them. And this is a Temper and Practice which the Go&s;pel requires, and which Chri&s;t him&s;elf recommends by his own Example, who&s;e whole Life was a continued Act of Goodne&s;s and Kindne&s;s to Man; and &s;uch a Temper is always to be &s;ound where the Spirit of God is at work in good Earne&s;t; for <HI>the Fruit of the Spirit is in all Goodne&s;s.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. 5.9.</NOTE></P>
<P>But yet there may be a great deal of this Temper operating, without any true Grace; and in &s;uch as are the Children of the wicked One, rather than the Children of God. For there is &s;uch a Thing as Good-nature: That is, &s;ome Men in their very Make and Con&s;ti|tution, are more inclined to peaceable, loving, kind, and generous Actions, than others. Some Men are more mild and gentle in their Tem|pers, and have le&s;s of Anger and Re&s;entment than others. And &s;ome have a more tender and compa&s;&s;ionate Temper, and are more &s;en|&s;ibly affected with the Difficulties and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their Friends and Neighbours, than others. And &s;ome are naturally more open hearted, and more free to give, than others.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="005117_0050_1016A8B87A401430">
Moreover the Manner of Men's Education may have a great Hand in this; they are bro't up in an open, free, generous Way of living, and under an Apprehen&s;ion of it's being mean and ba&s;e to appear clo&s;e and covetous: And &s;ome are bro't up in &s;uch a Way, as that no|thing appears more di&s;graceful to them, than to be penurious and clo&s;e; nor is there any Thing they are more afraid of, than not to be tho't generous and open hearted, and many Times will go beyound their Abilities in their Enter|tainments and Ways of living, for fear they &s;hould be tho't Niggards and Mi&s;ers. And now this &s;prings from Pride rather than any true Genero&s;ity, and from an unrea&s;onable Fear and Concern about their own Character, rather than from any true Regard to God and his Honour.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is the &s;ame Phari&s;aical Spirit in the World that was in our Saviour's Time, when they <HI>did their Alms to be &s;een of Men, and to have Glory of Men</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 6.2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it is no uncommon Thing for Men to treat each other with great outward Ci|vility and Re&s;pect; yea, and to heap many Kind|ne&s;&s;es upon them, when there is Envy and Malice in their Hearts.</P>
<P>Finally here, the Apo&s;tle &s;uppo&s;es a Man may go &s;o far as to <HI>give all his Goods to feed the

<P>If their Reputation runs high for &s;erious and religious Per&s;ons, and they under&s;tand that this is their Character among Men; it is very apt to rai&s;e their Opinion of them&s;elves, and it is exceeding natural for Per&s;ons to fall in with the good Opinion that others have of them. But now what is more precarious or uncertain than this? How many are there that bear a good Name and Character, that are very un|worthy of it, while others that are much more de&s;erving, are defamed and condemned? But then if any Per&s;on who is in great E&s;teem for his own Experiences, and for his Skill in exa|mining and trying Men's &s;piritual State, &s;hall pronounce upon &s;ome &s;uch, when they have examined, that they are converted, and &s;hall upon it call them the dear Children of God, they are very apt to conclude at once that it is &s;o, and to look upon them&s;elves as God's Chil|dren. But now this is a very uncertain and un&s;afe Way of determining the Matter as to our &s;piritual State. For alas, what is more fallable than the Judgment of Man, e&s;pecially when he undertakes to judge about the Hearts
<PB N="90" REF="005117_0051_1016A8E230DBD000">of others? It is exceeding difficult for Men to find out their own Hearts &s;o as to judge fully upon them, how much more difficult to judge the Hearts of others. If Men are apt to de|ceive them&s;elves, Oh how ea&s;y is it then to deceive others! Nay, &s;ome of the&s;e that under|take to judge the State of others, may be dread|fully deceived and deluded as to them&s;elves, and then no wonder if they &s;hould be deceived as to others, and be the Means of deceiving them. Moreover, &s;ome real Chri&s;tians may have an Exce&s;s of Charity, that is they may &s;ometimes judge too favourably of others, and think they are the Children of God when they are not. So that altho' it may be very proper for Per&s;ons to lay their Ca&s;e before experienced Divines, and conver&s;e with experienced Chri&s;|tians about their &s;piritual State? yet there mu&s;t not be too great Stre&s;s laid upon their Judg|ment; but you mu&s;t remember that <HI>Man looks at the outward Appearance,</HI> and <HI>that it is God alone that looks to the Heart,</HI> and that &s;ees to the Bot|tom of it. And you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that many and many a one who has been number'd among the Saints of God on Earth; yea, and had in high Reputation for their Piety and Good|ne&s;s, will be ranked with Sinners in the Day of Judgment. Who were in greater Reputation for Piety and Sanctity than the Phari&s;ees of old? and yet Chri&s;t pronounces them gro&s;s <HI>Hypocrites,</HI>

<P>The true Love of God and Chri&s;t, is one of the be&s;t Evidences that we are the Children of God, <HI>for God is Love, and every one that loveth is born of God</HI>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John 4.7, 8.</NOTE>. But yet there is a Sort of Love, and an Appearance of Love, which People are apt to be deceived with, which is no Sign of our being the Children of God.</P>
<P>Thus there <HI>is a loving in Word and in Tongue,</HI> which &s;ome at length come to per&s;wade them|&s;elves is a real hearty Love, that is, &s;ome Peo|ple take delight in di&s;cour&s;ing about Chri&s;t, and about Matters of Religion, and e&s;pecially about their own &s;uppo&s;ed Experiences, and particu|larly of the goings forth of their Souls as they imagine in Love to God and Chri&s;t, and they by frequent &s;peaking of the&s;e Things without a

<P>Again, there are &s;ome that think they love God and Chri&s;t, and &s;o are the Children of God; becau&s;e they love to attend upon &s;ome religious Duties, they love to read, they love to hear, they love to meet together for religious Wor&s;hip, and for Conver&s;ation about religious Matters, and &s;ometimes they are in &s;uch an earne&s;t Frame about the&s;e Things, that they know not how to let &s;lip any Opportunity for meeting together that occurs. And now there is a great Shew of Love to God in the&s;e Things; and it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that where there is true Love to God there will be a Love to his Hou&s;e, a Love to his Wor&s;hip, and to his Ordinances. But yet there is a Sort of Love to the&s;e Things, that is no certain Sign of Love to God, or of our being his Children. A Man may love re|ligious A&s;&s;emblies and religious Exerci&s;es upon &s;ome Accounts; and yet not truly love God. When there was but very little of the Love of God or of Obedience to him among the Chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> they abounded in Sacrifices, &s;o
<PB N="93" REF="005117_0052_1016675A36AE3AE0">that <HI>God was full of them and weary of them</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 1.11, 12.</NOTE>.

<P>Again, Some mi&s;take and think they love Chri&s;t &s;o as is a good Sign of their being the Children of God, becau&s;e they find them&s;elves much affected with a lively De&s;cription of the Sufferings and Death of Chri&s;t, when perhaps the &s;ame Affections might be rai&s;ed by reading or hearing any other affecting Tragedy, at lea&s;t if they &s;aw one acted upon the Stage. Chri&s;t's Sufferings may be de&s;cribed in &s;uch a lively Manner as to work very powerfully upon the Imagination and Affections, even &s;o as to draw forth Tears, yea, to cau&s;e Schreetches and Screamings out, and yet there may be no true Love to him.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="005117_0053_1016675C266D91F8">
Again, Per&s;ons may mi&s;take as to their Love to Chri&s;t, and &s;o their being the Children of God, this Way, <HI>viz.</HI> they are filled with Di|&s;tre&s;s and Terror becau&s;e of the Wrath of God and the eternal Torments of Hell-Fire they are expo&s;ed unto, and the Apprehen&s;ions that Chri&s;t will deliver them from Death, and Hell, and eternal Mi&s;ery, excite &s;ome Love and Affections in them to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but it is perhaps meer|ly upon this Tho't of his being their Deliverer from Mi&s;ery, without any Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e amiable Excellencies and Perfections in him, which demand their highe&s;t E&s;teem, Love, and Delight. They love him only as a Man would love another that &s;hould go into the Wa|ter and pull him out when he was ju&s;t &s;inking and drowning, he will in the Time of it have &s;ome grateful Sen&s;e of his Kindne&s;s, and will find &s;ome con&s;iderable Love going towards him, and yet perhaps may have no inward E|&s;teem for him; may have no Regard for him, but only for this one Act of Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus Per&s;ons may be plea&s;ed with the Tho't of having Chri&s;t for their Saviour, to &s;ave them from Hell and Mi&s;ery; and yet have no pro|per E&s;teem of him for his own real amiable Ex|cellencies, &s;o as to love him upon the Account of them; they may love him for his Goodne&s;s and Kindne&s;s to them, but not for his Wi&s;dom, his Ju&s;tice, his Truth, and Holine&s;s: They may love him for a Saviour, but not for a Sove|reign,

They will be plea&s;ed with him as well for being a Prince, as a Saviour; and will be as much plea&s;ed with the Thought of being delivered from the Power, as from the Puni&s;h|ment of Sin.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Many have great Dependance upon their acting Con&s;cienciou&s;ly, and being fearful of doing any Thing that will &s;tir up their Con&s;ciences a|gain&s;t them. But now, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, this is an uncertain Mark of being the Children of God.</HI></P>
<P>Many there are, who conclude they are the Children of God, and draw great Comfort to them&s;elves from this Con&s;ideration, that they make Con&s;cience of their Ways, and that they don't allow them&s;elves in offending again&s;t their Con&s;ciences, or in doing any Thing that their Con&s;ciences would accu&s;e them of.

<P>Thus we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Between Con&s;cience in the full Extent and Latitude of its Dictates, and in the re&s;trained li|mited Sen&s;e in which it is frequently taken.</HI></P>
<P>Thus con&s;idering Con&s;cience in the full Ex|tent of it, and it teaches us that we ought to aim at the Glory of God in all we do, and that we &s;hould keep his Commandments out of Love to God, and from a Principle of Obedience, and with &s;incere De&s;ires of plea&s;ing, and glori|fying him thereby.</P>
<P>Moreover, Con&s;cience enlightned by divine Revelation teaches us to do all we do in the Name of Chri&s;t and in Dependance upon his Grace to help us, tru&s;ting to find Acceptance only thro' him. Now taking Con&s;cience in &s;uch a large Sen&s;e and it dictates the whole of
<PB N="97" REF="005117_0054_101667E9ADF05C58">Chri&s;tianity to us, and con&s;equently to comply with the Dictates thereof, is to come up to the Precepts and Principles of Chri&s;tianity. And &s;uch as go this Length in complying with the Dictates of Con&s;cience, may upon good Grounds conclude they are the Children of God.</P>
<P>But taking Con&s;cience as it is more frequent|ly and commonly under&s;tood, and it intends no more than its dictating to us that this and the other is to be done by us, as our Duty; that this and the other is a Sin, and mu&s;t be avoided, without con&s;idering &s;o much how and after what Manner it is to be done either with Re|&s;pect to God or Chri&s;t. Con&s;cience, accord|ing to the common vulgar Under&s;tanding of it, don't &s;o much re&s;pect the Principle, the Views, and the Aims re&s;pecting God and Chri&s;t, as the bare doing or not doing the Thing. And now I &s;ay taking Con&s;cience in this re&s;trained Sen&s;e, and a Man may be con&s;ciencious, that is care|ful to do this and the other Duty, and to avoid this and the other Sin; and yet it may be no certain Sign of his being a Child of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between our Regards extending ultimately to God, and their terminating in Con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' we are to have a con&s;tant Regard to Con&s;cience, and mu&s;t govern our &s;elves by the Dictates thereof in all we do: yet our Tho'ts and Views, our Subjection and Obedience
<PB N="98" REF="005117_0055_1016A8BB60804C18">mu&s;t not terminate in Con&s;cience. But we mu&s;t look beyond Con&s;cience unto God, who&s;e Will and Command is our only Rule, and Con|&s;cience is not to be regarded, only upon the Suppo&s;ition of its dictating the Will of God to us. Con&s;cience is to be con&s;ulted upon all Occa&s;ions; but yet it mu&s;t not be con&s;idered as our Sovereign and &s;upreme Lord, but only as God's Deputy and Vicegerent in the Soul. We mu&s;t obey Con&s;ci|ence not meerly becau&s;e it is the Voice of Con&s;ci|ence, but becau&s;e we look upon it as the Voice of God, and as dictating the Mind and Will of God unto us. And &s;o our hearkening to the Dictates of Con&s;cience mu&s;t be in Obedience to God, and becau&s;e we look upon the Dictates thereof as the Will of God made known unto us. For unle&s;s we thus carry our Thoughts and Principles of Obedience beyond Con&s;cience unto God, we &s;hall make Con&s;cience to be our God and Sovereign, to the Neglect of the great God him&s;elf, who is the Lord of Con&s;cience. And even an Athei&s;t might go &s;o far as this, he might hearken to his own Con&s;cience accord|ing as it judged Things to be right or wrong, and God not be in all his Thoughts. Con&s;e|quently, if we may &s;uppo&s;e a Man to govern him&s;elf by Con&s;cience, without any ultimate Regard to God, and he would be mi&s;taken if he &s;hould look upon him&s;elf a Child of God.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="99" REF="005117_0055_1016A8BB60804C18">
3. <HI>We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between a free and vo|luntary Obedience to Con&s;cience, and a &s;ervile &s;lavi&s;h Subjection to it.</HI></P>
<P>Men may follow the Dictates of Con&s;cience, but not out of any love to, or delight in what they do: They may be even compelled and forced to it, for fear of the La&s;hes of Con|&s;cience afterwards. And &s;o to prevent the Trouble and Di&s;tre&s;s of Mind they know they &s;hall be in, if they don't hearken to Con&s;cience; they &s;ubmit to this and that which Con&s;cience tells them they mu&s;t do.</P>
<P>And this is the Ca&s;e with many Per&s;ons, they refrain from many known Sins, not be|cau&s;e they really hate them, and they comply with many known Duties, not becau&s;e they love and Delight in them; but merely out of Fear of their Con&s;ciences, lea&s;t they &s;hould ri&s;e up again&s;t them, &s;hould accu&s;e them, and &s;hould give great Trouble and Di&s;tre&s;s of Mind to them.</P>
<P>And now the Vertue and Goodne&s;s of &s;uch re|fraining from Sin, and complying with Duty, &s;eems to be no more than when a Man refrains from &s;uch and &s;uch a Sin, merely for fear of &s;ome bodily Pain and Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>For what is the real Difference in the Prin|ciple, when a Man refrains from a &s;inful Action for fear of a whipt Back, or &s;ome bodily Pain that it may naturally cau&s;e; and when it is merely to e&s;cape the Pain of the Mind, the
<PB N="100" REF="005117_0056_1016A8BE188CAB00">Girds and La&s;hes of a guilty Con&s;cience? You mu&s;t remember that I &s;ay, when it is wholly and merely for &s;ear of this. For that the Fear of Con&s;cience, and its &s;evere La&s;hes, is, and may be, an Argument with us to re&s;train us from Sin is undoubted, and &s;o may the Fear of bodily Pain or Puni&s;hment. But when it is only this Fear of the La&s;h of Con&s;cience that dictates and hinders us, it is a &s;ervile Fear of Con&s;cience, rather than a gracious child-like Fear of God; and &s;o is by no Means a Proof of our being the Children of God.</P>
<P>And thus we &s;ee how that Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s con|&s;idered in &s;ome Re&s;pects is a very different Thing from true Godline&s;s: And thus a Man may in &s;ome Sen&s;e be a con&s;cientious Man, and yet no true Child of God.</P>
<P>I have in&s;i&s;ted the longer upon this Head, and been more particular in making the Di&s;tinc|tions, becau&s;e it is &s;hocking at the fir&s;t Tho't to many, to &s;ay, that making Con&s;cience of their Ways is not a certain Sign of their being the Children of God; and that Per&s;ons might &s;ee what I mean by it, and that they might not commit a Mi&s;take in this Point, and &s;o mi&s;|carry at la&s;t: For this is a very dangerous Rock upon which many are lo&s;t, and the peculiar Dangerou&s;ne&s;s of it lies in this, that it is not &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;cerned as &s;ome others.</P>
<P>And thus I have mentioned &s;ome of the many fal&s;e and uncertain Marks of being the
<PB N="101" REF="005117_0056_1016A8BE188CAB00">Children of God, by which Multitudes have been, and are deceived.

Many have thought that they have been led by this good Spirit of God, and have been very confident about it, when really they have been govern'd only by their own Spirits, or deluded by the Devil that wicked Spirit; and there are (as has been &s;aid) a Multitude of Ways where|in Per&s;ons are deceived about their being led by the Spirit of God; how then &s;hall I know whether I am &s;o governed by him as to be a &s;ure and certain Mark of my being a Child of God? Well then, this is what I propo&s;e by the Help of God to &s;hew you at this Time, namely, <HI>When Per&s;ons are &s;o led by the Spirit of God, as to be a &s;ure and clear Mark of their being the Children of God.</HI></P>
<P>And now this, my Hearers, demands your diligent Attention, and careful Ob&s;ervation; for you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible there are &s;ome Things that look like the Leadings and Workings of God's Spirit, which indeed are but the natural Workings of our own, and it is very difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ome of the Workings of refined Nature from true Grace, and Men are exceed|ing apt to be mi&s;taken herein, and have many Times taken this and that to be the Workings of the Spirit of Grace, when really they are one Workings of their own Imaginations or Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>What I propo&s;e therefore is to give you &s;ome of the cleare&s;t and be&s;t Marks I can, of our
<PB N="108" REF="005117_0060_1016A8C9F2D8EC08">being led by the Spirit of God, and of our be|ing under a divine and gracious Influence in what we do; by which, if we do not mi&s;take in the Application of the&s;e Marks, we may in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure judge what Manner of Per&s;ons we are.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall not con&s;ider any of the ex|traordinary Gifts, or miraculous Operations of the Spirit of God, in which the Holy Gho&s;t fell upon the Apo&s;tles, in the Day of Penteco&s;t; for the&s;e extraordinary and miraculous Gifts, are di&s;tant from the Graces of the Spirit, and are in their Nature &s;eparable from them, and &s;o are no certain Signs of our being the Children of God. Men may have tho&s;e Gifts of the Spirit, and not be the Sons of God; for Gifts and Graces don't always go together, no not tho&s;e extraordinary Gifts. <HI>Many will &s;ay in the Day of Judgment, Lord, have we not prophe&s;ied in thy Name, and in thy Name ca&s;t out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful Works, to whom Chri&s;t will &s;ay, Depart from me ye that work Ini|quity</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 7.22, 23.</NOTE>. So that even the&s;e extraordinary Leadings or miraculous Operations of the Spirit, are no infallible Sign of Grace, and &s;o not of our A|doption, therefore I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of them.</P>
<P>Neither in the &s;econd Place &s;hall I take No|tice of &s;uch Things, as the Workings of God's Spirit may be only the accidental Cau&s;es of,
<PB N="109" REF="005117_0060_1016A8C9F2D8EC08">and which Things may be, and oftentimes are, produced by &s;ome other Cau&s;es. That is, I &s;hall not &s;peak of any extraordinary Commo|tions of Spirit or Body, nor any Out-cries for Sorrow, or Screamings for Joy, or falling down, or Swoonings, and Faintings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at the Preach|ing of the Word, or other religious Exerci&s;es; for altho' the Spirit of God no doubt may come &s;o powerfully in Convictions, and Comforts, and Joys, upon weak Spirits as even to over|come them, and &s;o be the accidental Cau&s;e of &s;uch Appearances &s;ometimes; yet as it is po&s;&s;i|ble, and no Ways improbable, but that &s;uch uncommon Appearances, may oftentimes ari&s;e from quite different Cau&s;es; and the Spirit of God have no Hand in them, but in a providen|tial Way, &s;o the&s;e can be no certain Marks or Tokens of a Man's being under the &s;pecial O|perations of the Spirit of God; therefore there is no Stre&s;s at all to be laid upon &s;uch Things con&s;idered in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But the Tokens and Marks that I &s;hall give you, of your being &s;o led by the Spirit of God, as to be a certain Sign of your being the Chil|dren of God, &s;hall be &s;uch as ari&s;e from the very Nature of the divine Spirit him&s;elf, as it is revealed, to us in the Names, Titles, and Cha|racters that are given of him in the holy Scrip|tures, and <HI>the&s;e the&s;e,</HI> my Brethren, you may depend upon.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="005117_0061_1016A8CBF52E1320">
So then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>I &s;hall begin with that Character or Title given of this Spirit in our Text, where he is called the</HI> SPIRIT OF GOD.</P>
<P>So that this Spirit which leads and governs every Child of God is the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> the third Per&s;on in the adorable Trinity, and &s;o is indeed God. And he is frequently &s;tiled the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>And now if it be the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> that leads them, we may conclude that he will lead them unto God. For whether &s;hould the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> lead us, but unto God him&s;elf?</P>
<P>The <HI>Spirit of God</HI> mu&s;t needs lead us to the Belief of his Being and Perfections, and to the Knowledge of him, and Acquaintance with him in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, and to have a &s;pecial Regard to him in all our Actions. If the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> leads us he mu&s;t needs lead us to <HI>believe that God is,</HI> and to &s;ee and apprehend &s;omething of his Glory and Maje&s;ty, and of tho&s;e glorious Ex|cellencies and Perfections that make up the divine E&s;&s;ence. Moreover, The <HI>Spirit of God</HI> will lead us to &s;ee and con&s;ider him in the Re|lation he &s;tands in to us, and to all the World, as our Creator, our Pre&s;erver, and our &s;overeign Lord and Ruler; and &s;o will lead us to e&s;teem and admire him, to wor&s;hip and adore him, to love and fear him, to tru&s;t in him, and obey him, to be above all concerned for his Glory, and to place all our Happine&s;s in him. Now
<PB N="111" REF="005117_0061_1016A8CBF52E1320">I &s;ay, that that Spirit which is the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> whenever he leads any of us, mu&s;t needs thus lead us to God.</P>
<P>Well then, if you would know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you mu&s;t &s;ee whe|ther you are thus led to God, or no. Are you led to &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions of God, and to &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions and Affections of Soul towards him, as are due to him from us? Have you a firm Belief of his Being, and have you the highe&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of his infinite Maje&s;ty, and of all his glorious Excellencies and Perfections? Do you &s;tand in an holy Awe of him, &s;o as to wor|&s;hip him with Reverence and godly Fear, and are you afraid of &s;inning again&s;t him? More|over, do you love him with all your Heart and Soul, have you the highe&s;t E&s;teem of him, have you the mo&s;t ardent De&s;ires after him, and do you take the greate&s;t Delight in drawing nigh to him, and in having Communion with him? Are you really concerned for his Honour and Glory, and have you a Care, and is it your De&s;ire and Endeavour to plea&s;e, honour and glorify him in all Things? And do you find your &s;elves grieved and troubled whenever you &s;ee God di&s;honoured, or di&s;plea&s;ed? Does Sin trouble you becau&s;e it di&s;honours God, and of|fends him? And can you &s;ay that you are &s;o concerned for the Glory of God, that there is a general and a governing Aim at it in all you do, even in the daily Concerns and common Affairs
<PB N="112" REF="005117_0062_1016A8CEE219B0C8">of Life? Do you in any Mea&s;ure come up to the Apo&s;tle's Rule, that <HI>whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, you do all to the Glory of God.</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 10.31.</NOTE> Furthermore, Do you find your&s;elves devoted to the Service of God, and are you &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his Will? Do you find and feel your &s;elves under the Influence of his divine Power and Authority, and do you find a ready Subjection to his Preceptive Will, and a quiet Submi&s;&s;ion to his providential Will? Can you heartily &s;ay as in the Lord's Prayer, <HI>Thy Will be done?</HI> And do you really de&s;ire to know, obey and &s;ubmit to his Will in all Things? Again, Do you plainly &s;ee that he is the only &s;atisfying Portion of the Soul? And can you truly &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 119.57. <HI>Thou art my Portion, O Lord?</HI> And do you plainly perceive that all your real Happine&s;s lies in the Enjoy|ment of God? And do you find the Streams of Goodne&s;s that flow from him to you, enlarge your Heart towards him, and lead you nearer and nearer to the Fountain of all Good?</P>
<P>Now if it be thus with you, you may con|clude that you are led by the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> and con&s;equently are the Children of God. For who or what would lead us to God in &s;uch a Manner as this, but the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> him&s;elf?</P>

2. <HI>This Spirit is called</HI> the SPIRIT OF CHRIST, con&s;equently he will lead us to CHRIST, and to GOD thro' CHRIST.</P>
<P>Thus he is called in the 9th Ver&s;e of the Context, <HI>If any Man have not the</HI> SPIRIT OF CHRIST, <HI>he is none of his.</HI> So 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.11. he is called the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t.</HI> And now this divine eter|nal Spirit was the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t,</HI> con&s;idering Chri&s;t in his mediatorial Office, for Chri&s;t as Media|tor, <HI>received the Spirit not by Mea&s;ure,</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John 3.34.</NOTE> and he dwelt in him.

<P>And now if it be the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> which <HI>te&s;tifieth concerning Chri&s;t,</HI> that leads
<PB N="114" REF="005117_0063_1016A8D4093C4DB8">and governs every Child of God, we may cer|tainly conclude that <HI>this Spirit</HI> will lead them unto <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> to the Knowledge, the &s;aving Knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to a &s;incere Belief on <HI>him,</HI> and to a hearty Acceptance of <HI>him</HI> as he is re|vealed and offered in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>And this Spirit leads the Soul to Chri&s;t by <HI>convincing him of Sin,</HI> of the Evil of Sin in gene|ral, and of his own Sinfulne&s;s in particular. He opens the Man's Eyes to &s;ee what a vile Creature he is by rea&s;on of Sin. He gives him to &s;ee how that his corrupt Nature, and his &s;in|ful Life has rendred him very odious and offen|&s;ive to the infinitely holy God, that he is ob|noxious to divine Ju&s;tice; and that he de&s;erves nothing le&s;s than Death, Hell, and eternal Mi|&s;ery. He gives him to &s;ee that all the Cur&s;es of God's Law are out again&s;t him, and that he is liable every Day to be &s;eized by divine Ven|geance, and that it is of the Lord's Mercies that he is not con&s;umed in the Flames of Hell.</P>
<P>Moreover, This ble&s;&s;ed Spirit in leading the Soul to Chri&s;t, leads him to &s;ee that he has no Way to help and deliver him&s;elf out of this wretched State. He gives the Soul to &s;ee that he has not wherewith to atone for his Sin, or make Satisfaction to divine Ju&s;tice: For the Soul that is thereby convinced of Sin, &s;ees &s;uch an infinite Evil in Sin, and that it reflects &s;uch an infinite Di&s;honour upon God, that nothing he has to offer to God can be &s;ufficient to atone
<PB N="115" REF="005117_0063_1016A8D4093C4DB8">therefor. He &s;ees that <HI>Lebanon is not &s;ufficient to burn, nor the Bea&s;ts thereof &s;ufficient for a Burnt-offering</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 40.16.</NOTE>. Nay, he is by the Spirit made to &s;ee, that if God would accept of his &s;incere Repentance for his pa&s;t Sins, and A|mendment of Life for the future; yet that he has no Heart herefor, but that if he be left to him&s;elf, he &s;hall, in&s;tead of repenting and re|forming, be adding continually to the Score of Guilt, and <HI>trea&s;uring up Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath&punc;</HI> So that he by the Spirit is led to &s;ee, that if left to him&s;elf, he has no Hope no Help; but mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h.</P>
<P>Moreover, The Spirit leads him to &s;ee that there is no Way to Salvation but in and thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>that there is no Salvation in any other, nor any other Name given under Heaven among Men, whereby we can be &s;aved, but only the Name of Je&s;us</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts 5.12.</NOTE> And here the Spirit opens the Eyes of the poor convinced Soul to &s;ee Je&s;us <HI>whom God hath exalted at his own right Hand to be a Prince and Saviour, to give Repen|tance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts 5.31.</NOTE>.

Accordingly this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit per&s;uades and enables the Soul to come to Chri&s;t, and to come to God thro' him, and to commit the whole Affair of his Salvation in|to
<PB N="116" REF="005117_0064_1016A8D58F0EE778">his Hands, heartily accepting of him in all the Offices that he &s;u&s;tains and executes as our Redeemer.</P>
<P>Now then if you would know whether you are led by the Spirit; you mu&s;t &s;ee whether he thus leads you unto the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Has this Spirit thoro'ly convinced you of Sin? Have you been led to &s;ee your &s;inful, lo&s;t and peri&s;hing State, and the ab&s;olute Need you &s;tand in of a Saviour? And have you &s;een the Ful|ne&s;s and all-&s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t, and the Fit|ne&s;s there is in him to be a compleat Saviour to you? Have you ever &s;een the amiable Ex|cellencies there are in Chri&s;t, and his amazing Love to poor peri&s;hing Sinners, in purcha&s;ing and procuring eternal Redemption for them, at the Price of his own mo&s;t precious Blood and Life? Do you al&s;o &s;ee how that in this Affair of our Salvation by a Redeemer God has a|bounded towards us <HI>in all Wi&s;dom and Prudence,</HI> and do you highly approve of this Method of Salvation, which humbles Man, and exalts free Grace; and do you heartily come into it? Do you receive him heartily and unre&s;ervedly as the <HI>Prophet, Prie&s;t</HI> and <HI>King</HI> of your Salvation? Do you &s;ubject your &s;elf to him, as freely as you rely upon him for Salvation, nay do you &s;ee that your Salvation does very much con&s;i&s;t in a Subjection to him? Do you &s;hake off all Dependance upon your &s;elves, or upon any Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s or Worthine&s;s of your own, and do

And are you willing, hear|tily willing, to be &s;aved in the Way that Chri&s;t offers to be your Saviour?</P>
<P>Furthermore, Are you &s;o led to Chri&s;t as to be in love with him? Do you &s;ee a Come|line&s;s, a Beauty, and a Glory in him, &s;o as to e&s;teem him the Chief among ten Thou&s;ands, alto|gether lovely? And do you love him above Fa|ther, and Mother, and Brother, and Si&s;ter, and Wife, and Children, and Hou&s;es, and Lands; yea, and above your very Lives?

<P>Finally here, are you &s;o led to him, as to be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure conformed to him? Have you &s;omething of the &s;ame Mind in you as was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us? Has this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of Chri&s;t a&s;&s;imilated you, and made you like to him in the Temper of your Minds? And does it lead you to tread in his Steps, and walk as he walked in the World? Have you learned of him who was humble, and meek, and lowly in Heart? Are you diligent, and devout, are you patient, and forgiving, are you harmle&s;s and

And is there any Thing of that Care and diligent Endeavour to fini&s;h the Work which God has given you to do, as there was in him?</P>
<P>And now if you can find &s;uch a Temper, and &s;uch a Behaviour towards the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, you may conclude that the Spirit of Chri&s;t has &s;o far the Leading of you, as to be a good Evidence that you are the Children of God.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Spirit by which the Children of God are led, is</HI> A SPIRIT OF TRUTH, <HI>by who&s;e In&s;piration the holy Scriptures were given: Con&s;e|quently &s;uch as are led by</HI> THIS SPIRIT, <HI>will have a high Regard for them, and will make them the Rule of their Faith and Practice.</HI></P>
<P>All Scripture was given by In&s;piration of God, that is of the Spirit of God: <HI>For holy Men of God &s;pake the&s;e Things as they were moved by the holy Gho&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 1.21.</NOTE>. Thus it was with the Scriptures of the old Te&s;tament, and it is the &s;ame with the Scriptures of the new Te&s;tament, for the Authors thereof had the Spirit of God with them, even the Spirit of Truth to lead them
<PB N="119" REF="005117_0065_1016A8D84D0F8180">into all, that is into all nece&s;&s;ary Truths <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 16.13.</NOTE>. And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> tells us that they &s;pake <HI>not in Words which Men's Wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the</HI> HOLY GHOST <HI>teacheth</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 2.13.</NOTE>. So that the Spirit which leads every Child of God is the &s;elf &s;ame Spirit which in&s;pired the Prophets and Apo&s;tles of old, and enabled them to deliver tho&s;e &s;acred Oracles of Truth contained in the Bible.</P>
<P>And now we may be &s;ure that all tho&s;e whom this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit leads and governs, he will lead them not only into the Belief of the Scriptures which came from him&s;elf; but into the Love of them, and into a Conformity to them.</P>
<P>So that if this Spirit has the Leading of any, it may be depended upon that he will lead them to receive the Word with Faith and Love, and to lay it up in their Hearts, and practice it in their Lives.</P>
<P>Now then if you would know whether you are led by this Spirit, you mu&s;t enquire how you receive and entertain the written Word of God. Do the Scriptures appear to you to be the Oracles of God, and &s;o the Oracles of Truth? And do the Truths thereof come with convincing Evidence? Do they come upon you in <HI>Demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and with Power?</HI> Are you brought to yield a full A&s;&s;ent to Go&s;pel Truths? Do you believe the Hi&s;tory,
<PB N="120" REF="005117_0066_1016A8D9E2F35788">the Doctrines, the Promi&s;es, the Threatnings, and the Prophe&s;ies of the old and new Te&s;ta|ment? And do the &s;ublime my&s;terious Doc|trines, which are plainly revealed in the Go&s;pel, come with &s;uch Demon&s;tration upon your Souls, as that you yield a full A&s;&s;ent to the Truth of them; even tho' they are above your Rea&s;on to comprehend?</P>
<P>Moreover, Are your Eyes &s;o opened, as <HI>to behold the wondrous Things contained in God's Law</HI> and Go&s;pel, and do you inwardly and heartily approve of the Go&s;pel Scheme, and Way of Sal|vation? And do you de&s;ire to be &s;aved in that Way?</P>
<P>Furthermore, You mu&s;t enquire how the Precepts and Rules of Living laid down in the Word of God affect you. Do they &s;trike you as the Laws of the King of Heaven, and as the Commandments of God our Saviour? Do you &s;ee the divine Authority that is in&s;tamped upon all of them? And have you a Sen&s;e of the Obli|gation you are under in Point of Duty, as well as Intere&s;t, to hear and ob&s;erve all that God has commanded, and can you find a Heart as well as a Tongue, to &s;ay, <HI>All that the Lord our God hath &s;aid unto us, that will we do?</HI> And be&s;ides a Sen&s;e of the divine Authority, do you &s;ee any Excellency in the Precepts them&s;elves? Do you &s;ee into the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of the divine Commandment in his Word? Can you &s;ay, that you <HI>e&s;teem all God's Precepts
<PB N="121" REF="005117_0066_1016A8D9E2F35788">concerning all Things to be right?</HI> Does the Law appear to be <HI>holy,</HI> and the Commandment <HI>holy,</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and <HI>good?</HI> And do you adhere clo&s;ely to the Word of God, as the only &s;ure Rule of your Faith and Practice? And do you reject every Thing in Religion that is not according to this Word? And do you hide this Word in your Heart that you may not &s;in again&s;t God?</P>
<P>Furthermore, Is the Word of God your Delight, as well as your Coun&s;ellor? Do you Delight in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law do you meditate Day and Night? Are you able to &s;ay that the Law of God's Mouth is better to you than Thou&s;ands of Gold and Silver, and are his Statutes your Songs in the Hou&s;e of your Pilgrimage, and is his Word &s;weeter to you than Honey, or the Honey Comb?</P>
<P>But then can you al&s;o &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, 119.140. <HI>Thy Word is</HI> VERY PURE, <HI>there|fore thy Servant loveth it?</HI> Here con&s;ider I be|&s;eech you very particularly, whether it be the <HI>Purity</HI> of God's Word that in an e&s;pecial Man|ner recommends it to your Choice, your Love, and Delight. Do you love the Word of God becau&s;e its Doctrines are <HI>pure,</HI> and its Precepts <HI>holy,</HI> and becau&s;e they tend to in&s;truct you in the Nature of <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> and al&s;o to make you <HI>holy.</HI></P>
<P>And now if it be thus with you, you may conclude that you are led by this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit,
<PB N="122" REF="005117_0067_1016A8DDDBA2AD30">and are the Children of God; for the Spirit of God is uniform in his Operations.

<P>As for the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he is our <HI>Advo|cate</HI> with the Father; If any Man &s;in we have an <HI>Advocate,</HI> or <HI>Paraclete,</HI> with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John 2.1.</NOTE>The &s;ame Word is u&s;ed as when the holy Gho&s;t is called the <HI>Com|forter.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> So that every true Child of God has not only an Advocate in heaven with the Father, but has an Advocate, or Paraclete, with, or within him&s;elf, even the holy Gho&s;t, which God the Father (thro' the Merits and Interce&s;&s;ion of his Son) has &s;ent to perform the Office of an Advocate, to plead and &s;trive with us, to &s;tir up Convictions in our Souls, of our Sin and Dan|ger; and to per&s;wade and enable us to an hearty Acceptance of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of Salvation by him: And to put us upon de&s;iring, &s;eeking, and praying to God for our &s;elves and others, for all needed Mercy and Grace.</P>
<P>So that one great Office of the holy Gho&s;t is, to plead with Men, and to put them upon pleading with God for them&s;elves and others, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the great Duty of Prayer, &s;tirring up &s;incere De&s;ires and devout Affections, and enabling us to pour out our Souls to God in Prayer; and this we are taught in the 26th
<PB N="127" REF="005117_0069_1016675716CC6530">Ver&s;e of the Context, where the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Likewi&s;e the Spirit al&s;o helpeth our Infirmities: For we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it &s;elf maketh Interce&s;&s;ion for us with Groanings that cannot be uttered.</HI></P>
<P>And now from hence we may certainly ga|ther, that whenever a Man is led by the Spirit of God, &s;o as to be a Mark that he is a Child of God, he will be put upon the Exerci&s;e of Prayer, he will &s;ee the Rea&s;onablene&s;s, the Agreeablene&s;s, the U&s;efulne&s;s, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of Prayer, and will be led not only into the diligent and con&s;tant Practice of Prayer, pray|ing always with all Prayer and Supplication, and continuing therein; but this Spirit will excite an Earne&s;tne&s;s and Fervency of Devo|tion, and will cau&s;e a Plea&s;ure in drawing near to God in this holy Duty.</P>
<P>For how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that this <HI>Para|clete,</HI> this <HI>Advocate,</HI> &s;hould have the leading and governing of any Per&s;ons without putting them upon being Advocates and Interce&s;&s;ors with God for them&s;elves and others?</P>
<P>Now then, if any of you would know whe|ther you are led by the Spirit of God, you mu&s;t &s;ee whether he has led and brought you to your Prayers, to frequent, con&s;tant, humble, fervent Prayer. Do you &s;ee your ab&s;olute Dependance upon God for every Thing? Do you &s;ee the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of Prayer? Do you &s;ee the great Priviledge of Prayer, and the infinite Conde|&s;cention
<PB N="128" REF="005117_0070_1016A8E5275DE568">and Grace of God, that he permits and allows us to draw near to him, and that we may come with Boldne&s;s to the Throne of Grace, to obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in Time of Need? And do you thank|fully improve this Priviledge, this Liberty of Acce&s;s, &s;o as in every Thing by Prayer and Supplication with Thank&s;giving to make known your Reque&s;ts to God?</P>
<P>And do you come humbly before God, &s;en|&s;ible of your Wants, and at the &s;ame Time &s;en&s;ible of your Unworthine&s;s of the lea&s;t Mer|cy?</P>
<P>Moreover, If you would judge whether you are led by the Spirit of Prayer, you mu&s;t con|&s;ider, whether you content your&s;elves with a dull, lifele&s;s Form of Prayer Morning and Even|ing; or whether there be &s;ome hearty De&s;ires, and whether your Soul is poured out in Prayer, which is indeed what God looks upon as Prayer?</P>
<P>Enquire here further &s;till, and &s;ee whether you love Prayer, whether you delight in draw|ing near to God, and take Plea&s;ure in &s;pread|ing your Ca&s;es before God, and pleading with him for Mercy and Grace. Are you thankful for this Liberty of Acce&s;s to God, and do you go to him with your Prayers and your Prai&s;es as your Delight and Plea&s;ure, rather than as your Ta&s;k and Burden? And enquire particu|larly here, whether it is &s;ufficient for you that you have Leave and Liberty to go to God by
<PB N="129" REF="005117_0070_1016A8E5275DE568">Prayer in your Clo&s;ets and in your Families, without in&s;i&s;ting upon a direct and po&s;itive Command for it? For he that has the true Spirit of Prayer wants nothing but Liberty to go to God with all his Wants, and to be fre|quent at the Throne of Grace.</P>
<P>And therefore &s;uch as ca&s;t off Fear and re|&s;train Prayer before God, or take no Plea&s;ure in Prayer, and are rather glad of an Excu&s;e to omit the Duty, rather than of an Opportunity to renew their Addre&s;&s;es to God, how dwelleth the Spirit of Prayer in &s;uch a Man? After the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was converted it is &s;aid, <HI>Behold he prayeth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 9.11.</NOTE> And therefore &s;uch as don't give them&s;elves unto Prayer, and take no De|light in that Duty; it is a &s;ad Sign that they are not the Children of God. A prayerle&s;s Per&s;on is doubtle&s;s a gracele&s;s one.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>This Spirit by which the Sons of God are led is</HI> A SPIRIT OF ADOPTION, <HI>and con|&s;equently every one that it led by this Spirit, has a child-like Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of Soul towards God wrought in him.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we read in the Ver&s;e immediately following my Text. But ye have not recei|ved the Spirit of Bondage again to Fear, but the <HI>Spirit of</HI> ADOPTION, whereby we cry, <HI>Abba Father.</HI></P>

Now he is called the Spirit of Adoption, be|cau&s;e he works in us the Temper and Di&s;po|&s;ition of Children towards our heavenly Father; enabling us to call him Father, and putting us upon going to him with the Reverence and Confidence of Children to a Father, able and ready to help us; for &s;o &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, Gal. 4.6, 7. <HI>Becau&s;e ye are Sons, God hath &s;ent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a Ser|vant, but a Son.</HI></P>
<P>Now then if you would know whether you are led by this Spirit, you mu&s;t examine and &s;ee, whether there be any of this child-like Temper wrought in you. Do you look upon God as your Friend and Father? And can you find any Thing of the Honour, the Fear, the Love, the Reverence for him that is infinitely due to &s;uch a Father? Do you go to him with the Freedom, with the Delight, and with the Confidence of Children to a Father? Do you depend upon him for your daily Bread, both for your Souls and Bodies, as Children do up|on their Parents? Are you concerned for the Honour of your heavenly Father, as loving, dutiful Children are for the Honour of their earthly Parents? Does it grieve you to &s;ee him di&s;honoured and offended, and his Name pro|phaned and bla&s;phemed; and do you inwardly re&s;ent it, as much as a dutiful Child would when he &s;hould hear his Father &s;landered and

<P>Furthermore, Do you find any Thing of a dutiful and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Temper towards your heavenly Father? Can you with Sincerity and from your Heart &s;ay what our Lord has taught you to pray, <HI>Our Father, thy Will be done on Earth as it is done in Heaven?</HI> Have you &s;uch a Re|gard to him as &s;tanding in the Relation of a Father, as puts you upon keeping all his Com|mandments, and can you &s;ay that none of his Commands are grievous to you, but that you delight to do his Will? And do you as quietly &s;ubmit to his wi&s;e and fatherly Corrections? And can you &s;ay in any Mea&s;ure with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t at the Approach of Trouble and Sorrow, <HI>Father, not as I will; but as thou wilt</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark 14.36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Again, Do you tru&s;t in, and can you &s;o de|pend upon your heavenly Father's Wi&s;dom and Care and covenant Love and Faithfulne&s;s, as to re&s;t &s;atisfied with all his Di&s;pen&s;ations, and do you actually find the happy Fruit of all his deal|ings with you? Do they work for your Good, your &s;piritual Good, as they do to all them that love God?</P>
<P>Finally, Do you &s;ee any Likene&s;s or Re|&s;emblance of your heavenly Father in you, as
<PB N="132" REF="005117_0072_1016A8EBD3898E70">there is commonly between earthly Parents and their Children? Do you find any Likene&s;s to God in the moral Perfections of his Nature? Is the Image of God which was lo&s;t by the Fall of our fir&s;t Parents, in any Mea&s;ure re&s;tored? Have you learned to be righteous as God is righteous, to be <HI>holy as God is holy,</HI> to be <HI>mer|ciful as God is merciful,</HI> and <HI>perfect as your hea|venly Father is perfect?</HI> Now if it be thus with you, it will be certain that God has indeed &s;ent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The Spirit of God is a powerful and active Spirit, and productive of all good Fruits; con&s;e|quently when any are led by the Spirit of God,</HI> THERE WILL BE THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT.</P>
<P>But I have no Time to enter upon the par|ticular Con&s;ideration of the&s;e, at pre&s;ent, but &s;hall leave them to be con&s;idered hereafter, when God &s;hall give the Opportunity.</P>

<PB N="133" REF="005117_0072_1016A8EBD3898E70">and &s;o deceive your own Souls.

Becau&s;e altho' in &s;ome Things they may &s;eem to be led by the Spirit of God, but in others there are &s;ad Demon&s;trations yet that they are not.

<P>But then as Love to all Mankind is a Fruit of the the Spirit, &s;o a &s;pecial and peculiar Love to the Children of God, and the Hou&s;hold of Faith, is wro't in the Soul by this Spirit; for the Spirit of God will lead every one that is under his Influence, to love the Children of God in an e&s;pecial Manner.</P>
<P>Here then you &s;hould examine your &s;elves, whether you find a &s;pecial and peculiar Love going forth towards all that you apprehend to be the true Children of God: If you have had no Acquaintance with them, and received no Be|nefit from them, nay if you have never &s;een them; yet does the Repute of their being the Children of God, and Servants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, draw forth your Heart in E&s;teem of them, and Love to them?

And now, altho' <HI>Joy in the Lord,</HI> is the Fruit of the Spirit, and what we &s;hould particularly examine our &s;elves about, to &s;ee whether we do really joy in the Lord, and rejoice greatly in the God of our Salvation, whether we re|joice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and at the Advancement of his Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t, and whether the Me|ditation upon God, and Chri&s;t, and &s;piritual Things be &s;weet unto us, and whether there be a greater Delight in God's Service, and in en|joying Communion with him than in any worldly Service, or carnal Enjoyment what&s;o|ever, and whether we find the Joy of the Lord to be our Strength; I &s;ay, altho' we &s;hould examine our &s;elves in the&s;e Things; yet I would con&s;ider this <HI>Joy</HI> with Re&s;pect <HI>to our fel|low Creatures</HI> in a particular Manner, even our rejoicing heartily at the Good and Welfare of others, and our doing with Delight and Plea|&s;ure what will promote their Happine&s;s and Comfort. This <HI>Joy</HI> is a Branch of that grand comprehen&s;ive Command of <HI>loving our Neigh|bour as our &s;elves,</HI> and flows from &s;uch a Prin|ciple of Love reigning in the Soul. So that where there is that <HI>Joy</HI> which is the Fruit of the Spirit, there will be not only an external, but an inward hearty Rejoicing at the Good of others, at their &s;piritual Good in an e&s;pecial Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="005117_0078_1016A8FDE761FC48">
This Joy which is the Fruit of the Spirit is the direct Contrary to that Envying and Grie|ving at the Good of our Neighbours, which is &s;o natural to us in our corrupt E&s;tate.

It intends that we do &s;o truly and heartily love Mankind, that it is a Joy and Plea&s;ure to us to be doing that which will afford Comfort and Joy to others.</P>
<P>And now this Joy which is the Fruit of the Spirit, is not confin'd to particular Friends and Neighbours, and dear Relations, but it mu&s;t reach to all that we are concerned with, and that come within the Reach of our Kindne&s;s; even altho' they have injured and abu&s;ed us.</P>

<P>And if we &s;hould con&s;ider this, with Re&s;pect to <HI>Peace</HI> with God thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and <HI>Peace</HI> with Con&s;cience, and undoubtedly it is the Fruit of the Spirit.</P>
<P>But I will con&s;ider it at pre&s;ent only as <HI>Peace</HI> among Men. And therefore &s;uch as are led by this Spirit, will be led into a peaceable Tem|per and Behaviour.</P>
<P>The Spirit of God, wherever it leads and governs, will &s;uppre&s;s a contentious and quar|rel&s;ome Spirit: For it will &s;ubdue Pride, and <HI>tho&s;e other</HI> Lu&s;ts <HI>from whence come Wars and Fightings,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James 4.1.</NOTE> and le&s;&s;er Contentions.

Do you dread Contentions and Divi&s;ions? Do you carefully watch again&s;t eve|ry Thing that &s;tirs up Strife? Are you careful to avoid tho&s;e Things that are provoking to others?

<PB N="147" REF="005117_0079_1016A900B8199E38">and Provocations which are offered to your|&s;elves, rather than pro&s;ecute them into a Quar|rel?

<P>Furthermore, with Re&s;pect to others that are in Contention, are you <HI>Peace-Makers</HI> among them, &s;uch as our Saviour pronounced <HI>ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> and whom he &s;ays <HI>&s;hall be called the Children of God?</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. 5.9.</NOTE> Are you <HI>Coun&s;ellors of Peace?</HI> And are you careful to do what in you lies to ex|tingui&s;h every Fire of Contention &s;o &s;oon as you perceive it begins to burn?

<P N="4">4. <HI>Another Fruit of the Spirit is</HI> LONG-SUFFERING.</P>
<P>By which we may under&s;tand a re&s;training our Anger under Provocations; our bearing patiently any Injuries and Affronts that are of|fered unto us, in&s;tead of ha&s;tily proceeding to re&s;ent or revenge them. Now Patience, or Long-&s;uffering, is a Perfection of God, for &s;o his Name is proclaimed, <HI>The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious,</HI> LONG-SUFFER|ING <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exodus 34.6.</NOTE>. And &s;o it mu&s;t needs be a Perfection
<PB N="149" REF="005117_0080_1016A903E010F430">in the Spirit of God, what belongs to his Na|ture, and which he will work in every one that is brought under his divine Guidance and In|fluence. He will &s;o work upon, and in, all whom he leads that they &s;hall be <HI>Long-&s;uffering,</HI> and <HI>patient in Spirit:</HI> They &s;hall bear Injuries and Affronts, &s;o as to <HI>defer their Anger,</HI> and not break out into ra&s;h Wi&s;hes or revengeful Actions.</P>
<P>Indeed it mu&s;t be allowed that there is a great Difference in Men's natural Tempers, even among tho&s;e that we look upon to be the Children of God: Some Men are naturally much more ha&s;ty in Spirit than others, and it is with much more Difficulty that they re&s;train their Anger, than &s;ome others. Their Spirits are naturally &s;o volatile, and &s;o ea&s;ily put into Agitation, that they break forth oftentimes into angry Actions or Expre&s;&s;ions, even before the Man has Time to think of it, &s;o as to re&s;train his Pa&s;&s;ion: But yet if Men &s;ubject to &s;uch &s;udden and violent Pa&s;&s;ions are under the go|verning and re&s;training Influences of the divine Spirit, they will have their Pa&s;&s;ions under better Command, &s;o as to keep in from &s;uch &s;udden, violent Out-breakings of ra&s;h Anger, which others that are under no Re&s;traint do fall into. Whenever the holy Spirit comes to purpo&s;e he &s;anctifies Men's particular Tempers, and even their angry Pa&s;&s;ions, making u&s;e of them to
<PB N="150" REF="005117_0081_1016A906B8C0B3A8">very good Purpo&s;es, turning them into a flaming Zeal for the Cau&s;e of God, and the Intere&s;t of Religion, as he did the warm Temper of <HI>Elijah.</HI> So he cau&s;es the ha&s;ty Spirit and angry Pa&s;&s;ions of Men to prai&s;e him, and the Remainder there|of he will re&s;train.</P>
<P>So then if you would judge whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you mu&s;t &s;ee what Government you have of your &s;elves, and of your Spirits. If you would know whether the Spirit of God rules in your Hearts, you mu&s;t know whether he has given you the Rule of your own Spirit, which is a glorious Attain|ment; for <HI>he that ruleth his own Spirit is greater than he that taketh a City</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. 16.32.</NOTE>. Here then let me a&s;k you, Are you enabled in any Mea&s;ure to keep under your Pa&s;&s;ions? Do you avoid ra&s;h Anger, and the being angry without a Cau&s;e? Have you learned to bear Provocations patient|ly, &s;o as not to have your Spirits ruffled, nor your Pa&s;&s;ions breaking out in an indecent un|chri&s;tian Manner? Have you learnt of your ble&s;&s;ed Lord to endure the Contradiction of Sinners?

Where the Spirit of God works this Goodne&s;s, the Man will de&s;ire and endeavour to do all the Good he can, according to the Capacity that God has given him, and the Station that God has placed him in. I &s;ay according to his Capacity and Station, becau&s;e he will be &s;en&s;i|ble, that if he attempts above his Capacity, and out of his Rank and Station, he will be in Danger of doing more Hurt than <HI>Good.</HI> I &s;ay there|fore that within his own Sphere he will endea|vour to do all the Good he can. Accordingly &s;uch a Man as is endowed with this Spirit of true Goodne&s;s, will con&s;ider what Abilities God has given him, and will take Heed that he don't boa&s;t of any fal&s;e Gift, or imagine him&s;elf fit for what he is not; nor on the other Hand, will he deny any of God's Gifts, or excu&s;e him&s;elf from any Service that would be for the Good of others, from a fal&s;e Pretence that he has not Ability for it. But he will think &s;o|berly of his Abilities and Capacities of doing Good, and will con&s;ider the Station that God in his Providence has placed him in; and &s;o what Opportunities he has in his Hand for get|ting and doing Good, and will readily and chearfully embrace the &s;ame. Is he a civil Ruler, and in any Place of Power and Tru&s;t, if he has this Spirit of Goodne&s;s, he will rule in the Fear of God, and endeavour according
<PB N="156" REF="005117_0084_1016A90F3A16F8C0">to the De&s;ign of his Office, to <HI>be the Mini&s;ter of God for Good</HI> to the People. Is he a Mi|ni&s;ter of the Go&s;pel; he will endeavour to do all the Good he can in this Station, and that he may do this Good e&s;pecially, which is the greate&s;t of all, even to convert Sinners from the Error of their Ways, and &s;ave their Souls from Death: Or if he be only in private Sta|tion, he will be content with that, to be con|cerned to do all the Good he can therein, by his E&s;tate, by his Coun&s;els, by his Example, and by his Prayers.</P>
<P>And now if you would know whether you are led by this Spirit of Goodne&s;s, you mu&s;t enquire whether you are thus inclined to all Acts of Goodne&s;s, and whether you live in the daily Practice of it, in Conformity to God him|&s;elf, who is not only Good, but does Good. Do you look upon your &s;elves as made to do all the Good you can, and that all which you have and are, is given and continued to you to do Good withal? And are you plea&s;ed with the Thoughts of having &s;uch and &s;uch Abilities and Opportunities for doing Good? Here let me a&s;k you, whether your being in any &s;uperiour publick Station plea&s;es you, <HI>chiefly</HI> upon this Account, namely, that it gives you an Oppor|tunity of being more exten&s;ively good to others; or is the Honour of it, and the Opportunity of &s;erving your &s;elves, that which mo&s;t &s;ecretly affects you? So again, if God gives Wealth,
<PB N="157" REF="005117_0084_1016A90F3A16F8C0">and Plenty of this World's Goods to you, what Thought is it plea&s;es you mo&s;t? Is it that now you &s;hall have the Name of a rich Man, and that now you have wherewith to gratify your Coveteou&s;ne&s;s, and inordinate Love of the World, and that you have Plenty wherewith to gratify your Pride, your Luxury, and Va|nity? Or does this plea&s;e you mo&s;t, to think that now you are enabled to do Good to others, that now you have wherewith to relieve &s;uch as are in Straits, to &s;upply the Wants of the Needy, to &s;up|port the Go&s;pel at home, &amp; to &s;pread it abroad? This I know is oftentimes the Language of Per|&s;ons before they arrive to any plentiful E&s;tate. And Oh what fine generous Projections are made by Per&s;ons provided they had but an E|&s;tate in their Hands! Now therefore if Per&s;ons would know whether they are &s;incere in this, they mu&s;t enquire whether they are now actually doing Good according to their pre&s;ent Ability: Do you now actually lay by, as God pro&s;pers you, for pious and charitable U&s;es? And are you doing Good according to your Ability as you go along? You that are rich, are you rich in good Works? And are the re&s;t of you, ac|cording to your Ability, ready to di&s;tribute, and willing to communicate for the publick Good? Let me a&s;k you, whether you choo&s;e rather to give to others that are in Wants, than to lay up for a Hoard, or lay out for Superfluities for your &s;elves? And are you concerned to deny
<PB N="158" REF="005117_0085_1016A910E871F930">your &s;elves &s;ome Conveniencies, that you might relieve others, under their Nece&s;&s;ities? And is it more Plea&s;ure to you to do that whereby others might have nece&s;&s;ary Food, than to fare &s;umptuou&s;ly your &s;elves? And had you rather cloath the Naked, than dre&s;s fine your &s;elves?</P>
<P>Moreover, you would do well to enquire, whether you are careful in your private Stations and Relations to be as good, and to do all the Good you can. If you are Hu&s;bands, or Wives, do you endeavour to be as good as you can in that Relation, whereby you may be meet Helps, mutual Comforts and Ble&s;&s;ings? If you are Parents, do you endeavour to do all the Good you can to your Children, by pro|viding for them, by in&s;tructing them, and bringing them up in the Fear of God, and in the Ways of Religion, whereby they may be capable of doing Good, and of being Ble&s;&s;ings in their Day? And if you are Ma&s;ters or Mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, do you give unto your Servants that which is ju&s;t and equal, and are you careful to teach and in&s;truct them, and to be of all the Benefit to them, both to their Souls and to their Bodies, that is ju&s;tly expected from you? In a Word, are you concerned to be as u&s;eful and beneficial to others as you can, and that every one might be the better by you, that has any Concern with you? Have you an Eye not meerly at your own Intere&s;t, but at the Good of others? And is there a publick generous
<PB N="159" REF="005117_0085_1016A910E871F930">Principle that runs thro' all your Actions, and that influences you in them? The&s;e, my Bre|thren, would be happy Tokens that you are led by the Spirit of God, who is Goodne&s;s it&s;elf, and is good to all, and by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, who was &s;o good as to leave Heaven it &s;elf to come upon this Earth, to redeem and &s;ave &s;uch &s;inful Worms as we are. <HI>For ye know the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that though he was rich, yet for your Sakes he became poor, that ye through his Poverty might be rich.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 8.9.</NOTE></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Another Fruit of the Spirit is</HI> FAITH.</P>
<P>By which is generally under&s;tood in this Place <HI>Truth, Sincerity,</HI> and <HI>Fidelity towards Men.</HI> It is our being true and &s;incere in our Words and Promi&s;es, and faithful in every Bu&s;ine&s;s we undertake, and in every Station and Rela|tion of Life, and to every Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in us. By <HI>Faith</HI> here we mu&s;t under&s;tand a Per&s;on's being &s;o true to his Word, &s;o faithful, and ho|ne&s;t in all his Concerns, as to gain Faith and Credit among others, &s;o as to be him&s;elf belie|ved, tru&s;ted to, and depended upon.</P>
<P>So that wherever this Spirit of God, this Spirit of Truth, works powerfully and effec|tually, it will produce this de&s;ireable but rare Fruit among Men. He will make Men true to their Words, &s;incere in their Profe&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="160" REF="005117_0086_1016A9156C31C820">and punctual to their Promi&s;es, hone&s;t in all their Dealings, and faithful in all their Tru&s;ts, di&s;charg|ing every Duty, and performing every Bu&s;ine&s;s, faithfully, hone&s;tly, and according to Expecta|tion and Agreement.</P>
<P>Now then, if you would know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you mu&s;t enquire for this Fruit of the Spirit, this Faith, this Truth, this Hone&s;ty, Uprightne&s;s and Fidelity.</P>
<P>Here then let me enquire of you, whether you hate the Way of Lying, and the Way of deceiving others by your Words? Are you careful to &s;peak the Truth one to another, or have you a Tongue that frameth Deceit? Are you careful in relating of Facts, not to exceed the Truth? Do you endeavour to make ju&s;t and true Repre&s;entations of Things, &s;o as to lead Per&s;ons into a ju&s;t and right Apprehen|&s;ion of them? Are you more concerned to re|late Stories as you receive them, than to em|belli&s;h them with Additions of your own? Are you more concerned to relate Matters of Fact as they really and truly are, than to &s;et them off with &s;ome aggravating Circum&s;tances beyond the Truth?</P>
<P>Again, Are you careful to avoid all Flattery, which is but Deceit and Fal&s;hood, and do you endeavour to deal plainly, faithfully, and truly one with another? And on the other Hand, Are you careful not to defame, not to rai&s;e nor &s;pread fal&s;e Reports again&s;t any, by which you
<PB N="161" REF="005117_0086_1016A9156C31C820">would not only wrong the Truth, but greatly injure your Neighbour's Credit and Character?</P>
<P>Again, Are you &s;incere in your Profe&s;&s;ions of Love and Friend&s;hip, or is your Love more in Word and in Tongue, than in Deed and in Truth?</P>
<P>But then again, you would do well to en|quire how it is with Re&s;pect to Promi&s;es. Are you cautious in making Promi&s;es; but when you have given your Word and Promi&s;e are you careful to fulfil it? Do you make Con|&s;cience of being as good as your Word, and do you endeavour that your Word may be as good as your Bond?</P>
<P>Again, let me enquire, whether you are true, faithful and hone&s;t in your Work as well as in your Words? Whatever Work you undertake, do you endeavour to do it faithfully according to your Skill and Power, &s;o that there &s;hall be no Deceit in the Work; do you in your &s;everal Occupations &s;ee to it that every Piece of Workman&s;hip that goes out of your Hands be done as it ought to be, that it is not &s;lighted over, nor its Defects covered, whereby others are deceived and impo&s;ed upon?</P>
<P>Furthermore, Do you endeavour to be faith|ful in every Relation? Are you according to your Marriage-Covenant, loving and faithful Hu&s;bands, loving, faithful and obedient Wives? Are you faithful Parents, and do you, accor|ding to your Covenant-Promi&s;es and Engage|ments,
<PB N="162" REF="005117_0087_1016A9195DFBA8C0">bring up your Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord? And are you faithful Children, paying that Honour, that Love, that Obedience and Subjection to your Parents that is due to them from you? Are you faithful Ma&s;ters to your bought or hired Servants, and to your Apprentices, giving them that In&s;truction and Knowledge in Religion, and in the particular Arts or Trades they come to be in&s;tructed in? And you that are Servants are you faithful to your Ma&s;ters, &s;erving them not with Eye-Service, as Men-plea&s;ers, but in Singlene&s;s of Heart, fearing God? Are you careful not to <HI>purloin,</HI> or wrong your Ma&s;ters in any Thing, but by Diligence and Care a|bout his Intere&s;t &s;hew all good Fidelity?</P>
<P>But to go on, if any of you are advanced to Places of Power and Tru&s;t, either in the State or in the Church, are you concerned to be faithful herein? Are you faithful to your King and Country, faithful to the Church &amp; Town, are you faithful to the College, and to every Society you are concerned with and for?</P>
<P>In a Word, Can you upon a thoro' and im|partial Reflection upon your own Conduct in your Places, find your <HI>Con&s;ciences te&s;tifying for you, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom, but by the Grace of God you have had your Conver&s;ation in the World?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 1.12.</NOTE> If your
<PB N="163" REF="005117_0087_1016A9195DFBA8C0">Con&s;ciences can but give &s;uch a Te&s;timony as this for you, it will be Matter of rejoicing to you, becau&s;e it will be an Evidence of your being under the Influence of a gracious Principle.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Another Fruit of the Spirit, is</HI> MEEK|NESS.</P>
<P>Now by <HI>Meekne&s;s,</HI> we may under&s;tand an humble quiet Spirit, the <HI>meek</HI> Man is he who is in a great Mea&s;ure delivered from the Power of Pride and Pa&s;&s;ion. He is the very Rever&s;e of the <HI>proud and haughty Scorner,</HI> and of him <HI>who deals in proud Wrath,</HI> of whom we read, <HI>Prov.</HI> 21.24. The <HI>meek</HI> Man is he that has a hum|ble Sen&s;e of him&s;elf, of his Sins, of his Infirmities, and Imperfections, and of his con&s;tant Liable|ne&s;s to err, and fall as others do: And he is di&s;po&s;ed to think and &s;peak of others, and to behave towards others, with that Humility and Conde&s;cention, with that Candour and Mode|ration, as becomes him under &s;uch a Sen&s;e of him&s;elf. The <HI>meek</HI> &s;pirited Man, is not a Man of a mean little Spirit; tho' he be poor in Spirit, yet he is not poor &s;pirited. The <HI>meek</HI> Man is not of a cowardly da&s;tardly Spirit. But that Meekne&s;s which is the Fruit of the Spirit, &s;up|po&s;es an enlarged, a generous, and a truly cou|rageous Soul. A Soul rai&s;ed up above the little Things which di&s;turb the Pride and Pa&s;&s;ions of others. The <HI>meek</HI> Man is not blind &s;o as not to &s;ee Faults, nor is he &s;tupid &s;o as not to be
<PB N="164" REF="005117_0088_1016A91AE29E7128">affacted with them; nor is he &s;o weak &s;pirited as to be afraid to re&s;ent or reprove a Fault. No, if the meek Man &s;ees his Brother offend, he will be ready to tell him of his Fault, and be as faithful in admini&s;tring a Reproof as any; but then he wont do it in a haughty and imperious Manner, but with a Spirit of Meekne&s;s, Love, and Tenderne&s;s: Not in a Way that tends to irritate but to convince his offending Brother, not to upbraid and reproach him for his Falls, and to vent his Pride and Pa&s;&s;ion, as is too com|monly the Ca&s;e, but in a friendly and yet faith|ful Manner, &s;o as to melt and humble, and bring to Repentance, and thereby gain his Brother.</P>
<P>For this Meekne&s;s which is &s;o great an Orna|ment of the Chri&s;tian, don't &s;uppo&s;e that we are without Pa&s;&s;ions, but the right Government of them by Rea&s;on and Religion, &s;o as to re|&s;train all that is proud and haughty, all that is ra&s;h and ha&s;ty, either in Heart, Speech or Be|haviour. And an excellent Spirit this is. This was the di&s;tingui&s;hing Character of the Man <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that he was MEEK <HI>above all the Men upon the Face of the Earth.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. 12.3.</NOTE> And we are told that <HI>an Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit is in the Sight of God of great Price.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 3.4.</NOTE> And many Things are &s;poken in Favour of the <HI>Meek. Ble&s;&s;ed are the Meek, for they &s;hall inherit the

<P>Now then, if you would know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you mu&s;t &s;ee whe|ther you have this ble&s;&s;ed Fruit of the Spirit. Are you &s;o led by the Spirit of Chri&s;t as that you have <HI>learned of him who was meek and lowly in Heart?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 11.29.</NOTE> Have you &s;omething of that Meekne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s that was in him? Have you a ju&s;t, that is a mean Opinion of your|&s;elves? Do you &s;ee that you are ignorant and weak, that you are corrupt and wicked, and that you have given great Provocation to God, and that you de&s;erve the heavie&s;t Judgments at his Hands; and when his Hand is heavy upon you, are you humble, &s;ilent, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, acknowledging that God puni&s;hes you far le&s;s than your Iniquities de&s;erve? And &s;o are you patient in Spirit, rather than proud and fretful in Spirit, under the afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Providence? Moreover, do you &s;ee &s;o much of your own Sinfulne&s;s and Weakne&s;s, as to e&s;teem others better than your &s;elves? And are you kindly affectioned one to another, in Honour preferring one another, in&s;tead of &s;tri|ving to be preferred above others? And in&s;tead of haughty Airs, and an imperious Carriage,
<PB N="166" REF="005117_0089_1016A91DCCE27640">do you behave with Meekne&s;s, and Kindne&s;s, and Conde&s;cention to your Inferiours and E|quals, as well as with Re&s;pect and Honour to your Superiours? If you are ever engaged in Controver&s;ies, do you manage with <HI>Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom,</HI> &s;o as to &s;hew not only that your own Spirit is calm, but &s;o as &s;hall al&s;o tend to &s;often, and calm, and quiet the Spirits of others? And if you receive Injuries, and meet with great Provocations, do you in Patience po&s;&s;e&s;s your Souls, looking upon all you meet with to be no more, nor &s;o much as you de&s;erve? And altho' it &s;hould be very unju&s;t from Men, can you bear it patiently, con&s;idering how very ju&s;t it is from God? In a Word, are you meek and lowly in Heart, and are you &s;o cloathed with Humility, as that it appears upon all Occa&s;ions, even in Days of Temptation, in Days of Pro|vocation? And if Pride and Pa&s;&s;ion do &s;ome|times break out, in&s;tead of ju&s;tifying your&s;elves, and &s;aying you <HI>do well to be angry,</HI> and that it is but a ju&s;t Re&s;entment, are you humble for it, and do you watch and pray again&s;t it? And are you upon the gaining Hand in this Re&s;pect? If it be thus with you, it is a good Evidence for you. But here I would &s;ay, to prevent your being deceived, that they are not the mo&s;t meek and humble Chri&s;tians that think them|&s;elves &s;o, or that talk a great deal of their Hu|mility; nay the humble Soul is oftentimes the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of it, and &s;ees and complains mo&s;t
<PB N="167" REF="005117_0089_1016A91DCCE27640">of his Pride and Pa&s;&s;ion, not but that even here al&s;o there may be a Delu&s;ion, for Per&s;ons may take a Pride in &s;peaking of their Pride, and in repre&s;enting them&s;elves to be exceeding proud and wicked.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>The la&s;t Fruit of the Spirit here mentioned, is</HI> TEMPERANCE.</P>
<P>Now by <HI>Temperance</HI> we are to under&s;tand, the due Regulations and Re&s;traints of our na|tural &s;en&s;ative Appetites and De&s;ires of any &s;en|&s;ative Enjoyment what&s;oever. The foregoing Fruits of the Spirit, referred more e&s;pecially to the Government of our Pa&s;&s;ions or Affections; this concerns the Government of our Appetites or &s;en&s;ative De&s;ires more e&s;pecially, and &s;uch as are led by the Spirit of God, the whole Man, the Appetites, as well as the Pa&s;&s;ions, will be governed by him; for when he comes to any Purpo&s;e, he &s;anctifies thro'out, in Spirit, Soul, and Body.</P>
<P>This Temperance intends the being &s;ober in the U&s;e of any of the good Things that God has given us to enjoy; and that we do not indulge our &s;en&s;ative De&s;ires any farther than is con|&s;i&s;tent with the Rules of Sobriety and Cha&s;tity, as they are laid down for us in the Word of God. It intends, that we con&s;ider the wi&s;e De&s;igns of God in giving tho&s;e &s;en&s;ative Appe|tites and De&s;ires to us. The one for the pro|pagating our Kind, and for pre&s;erving and pro|moting
<PB N="168" REF="005117_0090_1016A920C63E82C0">that intimate Love and Union between Hu&s;band and Wife, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the Comfort and Happine&s;s of the connubial State. The other Appetites for the Support, Comfort, and Refre&s;hment of our Natures. But as the&s;e Appetites &s;ince the Fall are all of them grown inordinate, and exceeding apt to carry us beyond due Bounds; &s;o it is nece&s;&s;ary for us to have them under &s;uch Re&s;traints as to an&s;wer the good Ends propo&s;ed by them. And the keeping our Appetites within the&s;e Bounds, is what is called <HI>Temperance.</HI> It is a pre&s;erving a Cha&s;tity in Heart, Speech, and Behaviour: It is a refraining from all Gluttony in Eating, and from all Drinking wherein is Exce&s;s. And &s;uch Regulations and Re&s;traints, when they a|ri&s;e from true chri&s;tian Principles, are by the Influence of the divine Spirit. And although &s;ome may be regular on the&s;e Accounts that have not the Spirit of God; yet there are none that are under the leading governing Influence of the Spirit, but what will be under the&s;e Re|gulations.</P>
<P>So then, would you know whether you are led by the Spirit of God, you mu&s;t enquire af|ter this <HI>Temperance,</HI> which is the Fruit of the Spirit. Are you, as the Word of God requires you to be, &s;ober, and cha&s;te, and temperate in all Things? Do you flee Fornication and all Uncleanne&s;s, and in&s;tead of having Fellow&s;hip with the unfruitful Works of Darkne&s;s, do you
<PB N="169" REF="005117_0090_1016A920C63E82C0">rather reprove them? Do you carefully avoid all la&s;civious and wanton Carriage, and do you lay a&s;ide all Filthine&s;s and fooli&s;h Talking and Je&s;ting, which is not convenient, and do you endeavour to bani&s;h all carnal Imaginations, and not &s;uffer impure Tho'ts to lodge within you? And in&s;tead of the&s;e Things, do you exhibit to the World a cha&s;te Conver&s;ation coupled with Fear, both in the married and unmarried State?</P>
<P>But then again, how do you regulate your other Appetites? Are you watchful again&s;t all Exce&s;s in Meat and Drink? If you find a &s;trong Appetite inclining you to eat more than is for your Health, do you watch and guard a|gain&s;t Exce&s;s herein, when you are at Fea&s;ts where there is Plenty, Variety, and Dainties, do you con&s;ider diligently what is before you, <HI>and put a Knife to your Throat?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 23.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> And how is it with you as to your drinking &s;trong Drink? Do you re&s;train and govern your Appetites in this Re&s;pect, &s;o as not to be intoxicated with it, and &s;o as not to rai&s;e your Spirits and your Pa&s;&s;ions beyond due Bounds? You mu&s;t re|member what the Preacher &s;ays, that <HI>Wine is a Mocker, and &s;trong Drink is raging, and who|&s;oever is deceived thereby is not wi&s;e.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. 20.1.</NOTE> But Oh how many are deceived hereby! Not only tho&s;e that are gro&s;s Drunkards; but many o|thers, who altho' they don't drink them&s;elves
<PB N="170" REF="005117_0091_1016A9238339E1C8">drunk, yet drink to &s;uch Exce&s;s as to hurt their Health, to break their Con&s;titution, to weaken their Judgment, to rai&s;e their Pa&s;&s;ions, to make them contentious and quarrel&s;ome at Home and Abroad: And by tarrying long at their Cups, wa&s;te their Time, &s;pend their Money, and im|poveri&s;h their Families. And now in the&s;e Ways Men are as truly guilty of a &s;inful Exce&s;s as when they are actually intoxicated with Drink; and whatever &s;ome &s;uch Per&s;ons may think of them&s;elves, it is a &s;ad Sign that they are not un|der the governing Influences of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit. Per&s;ons therefore &s;hould carefully examine them&s;elves in this Matter, and remember that all Eating and Drinking, beyond what is for Nouri&s;hment and Refre&s;hment, and that di&s;|compo&s;es the Mind, or indi&s;po&s;es the Body, and unfits for the Service that God calls unto, and that evidently tends to hurt our Healths, is Exce&s;s. Moreover, there is a high luxurious Way of living, in which Per&s;ons &s;infully gratify their Ambition as well as their Apetites. For altho' &s;uch as have a Plenty of this World's Goods may lawfully live in a more &s;umptuous Manner than others; yet for Per&s;ons of plenti|ful Incomes to live &s;o up to the Extent of their Means, as to di&s;able them&s;elves from tho&s;e Acts of Piety and Charity, which are ju&s;t and rea&s;on|able from their Incomes, and e&s;pecially when any live &s;o beyond their Means, as to &s;pend upon the E&s;tates of others, and di&s;able them|&s;elves
<PB N="171" REF="005117_0091_1016A9238339E1C8">from paying their ju&s;t Dues, it is a &s;inful Exce&s;s. In this therefore People would do well to examine them&s;elves; for I apprehend that Per&s;ons living above their Circum&s;tances is &s;in|ful, and contrary to what the Word and Spirit of God teaches, which is to <HI>be content with &s;uch Things as we have.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 13.5.</NOTE> Furthermore, you mu&s;t examine whether you keep in due Bounds as to your Diver&s;ions and Recreations, &s;o as to &s;pend no more of your precious Time in Plea&s;ure than may &s;erve to unbend your Spirits, to pro|mote your Health, and enable you the more chearfully to go on in your Bu&s;ine&s;s, or whe|ther your Love of Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure &s;o grows upon you, as that you fall into an idle, &s;lothful, carele&s;s Way of living, to the Neglect of God, and of your&s;elves and Families?</P>
<P>Now we mu&s;t examine our&s;elves in the&s;e Matters, and know what Government we have over our Appetites: For unle&s;s the&s;e be under due Regulations and Re&s;traints, we have no Rea&s;on to think we are led by the Spirit of God.

<P>And thus I have gone thro' the &s;everal Signs and Tokens which I propo&s;ed to give you, of Per&s;ons being &s;o led by the Spirit of God, as to demon&s;trate that they are the Children of God.

<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>Inf. 1. <HI>What we have heard about being led by the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of</HI> GOD, <HI>teaches us, that the Leading of this</HI> SPIRIT <HI>contains more in it than mo&s;t People imagine.</HI></P>
<P>Men are exceeding apt to have but a partial, and &s;o imperfect Notion of the Leadings of the divine Spirit, and of that gracious Principle, which influences and governs every good Chri&s;|tian. Men don't con&s;ider what a univer&s;al Principle this is; nor what a univer&s;al Change it works in Men's Hearts; nor what a univer|&s;al Influence it has upon Men's Lives. If Men were duly &s;en&s;ible of this, they would not be &s;o
<PB N="176" REF="005117_0094_1016A92D441A0C80">quick in judging them&s;elves to be the regenera|ted Children of God, as now they are.</P>
<P>By what you have heard, you may pre&s;ently under&s;tand, that wherever the Spirit of God comes powerfully and effectually, he &s;anctifies thro' out in <HI>Spirit,</HI> in <HI>Soul,</HI> and in <HI>Body.</HI> He inlightens the <HI>Under&s;tanding,</HI> he renews the <HI>Will,</HI> he regulates the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> he corrects the <HI>Appe|tites,</HI> and the particular <HI>Genius</HI> and <HI>Temper</HI> is &s;anctified: So that the Man is <HI>made a new Crea|ture, old Things are pa&s;&s;ed away, behold all Things are become new.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.17.</NOTE> This ble&s;&s;ed Spirit where|ever he leads, he leads the Soul to God, and to Chri&s;t, and to Holine&s;s; he leads to the Belief of the holy Scriptures as the only &s;ure Rule of Faith and Manners, leads to a devout, prayer|ful and tho'tful Frame of Soul, and into a child-like Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition. Moreover he leads the Soul to bring forth all tho&s;e &s;ocial Graces that are the Fruit of the Spirit, &s;uch as Love to our Neighbour, Joy in his Pro&s;perity, Peace, Long-&s;uffering, Gentlene&s;s, Goodne&s;s, Faith, Meekne&s;s, and Temperance. And in &s;hort, every Grace and Vertue that relates ei|ther to God, our Neighbour, or our &s;elves, are wrought in the Soul by the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, where he leads and governs. Altho' all tho&s;e Graces may not be &s;o con&s;picuous in &s;ome; yet it mu&s;t be &s;aid that there is the Principle, the Root and
<PB N="177" REF="005117_0094_1016A92D441A0C80">Foundation of every Grace laid in every Soul where the Spirit of God comes with Power.</P>
<P>But now this is not what People are general|ly aware of, they will indeed &s;ay that they be|lieve it to be &s;o; but then don't con&s;ider how exceeding broad the divine Commandment is, nor how exten&s;ive that Principle mu&s;t be, that will cau&s;e them to have Re&s;pect to all God's Commandments. Per&s;ons &s;ometimes find them&s;elves altered as to &s;ome particular Points, and they are ready to conclude that there is a thoro' and &s;aving Conver&s;ion to God, when there is really no &s;uch Thing. Some Convicti|ons and Terrors, and then &s;ome &s;udden Fla&s;hes of Joy, and &s;ome Re&s;traints or Refrainings from &s;ome particular Sins, and the running into the Practice of &s;ome particular Duties, have been too often mi&s;taken for the whole of Conver&s;ion and Regeneration. And they mi&s;take becau&s;e they don't know any better; they have never experienced a thoro' and &s;aving Change, and &s;o don't know by Experience what it is, nor how exten&s;ive it is; and no Wonder if they mi&s;take and frame very contracted Notions of Conver|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Inf. 2. <HI>Are only &s;uch the Children of</HI> GOD <HI>who are led by his</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>as has been de|&s;cribed, hence we may fear that the Number of &s;uch are comparatively &s;mall.</HI></P>

When we con&s;ider what it is to be led by the Spirit of God, and what a mighty Change is wrought thereby in Men's Hearts, and what a Turn is given to Men's Temper and Behaviour, and when we con&s;ider all the Fruits and Effects of the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, wherever he works power|fully and effectually, and alas where do we find &s;uch Men! Indeed we are not to expect to find any who have attained to &s;uch a Degree, as to <HI>be already perfect,</HI> and that have entirely gotten from under the Power of their Lu&s;ts, &s;o as to have no Out-breakings of Corruption! I &s;ay we are not to expect to find &s;uch: For the ble&s;&s;ed A|po&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> had not, nor had any of the Re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, attained to a &s;inle&s;s Perfection.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. 7.20.</NOTE> But even as to &s;uch as are &s;o under the gracious Influence of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit as that the Principle of Grace prevails above their Lu&s;ts, and Corruptions, which is the Ca&s;e of every true Chri&s;tian; I &s;ay, the Number of the&s;e is but &s;mall, compared with tho&s;e who are under the Power of their Lu&s;ts, and &s;o in their carnal unregenerate State. For let us but ob&s;erve the general Temper which Men di&s;co|ver, and let us ob&s;erve the general Cour&s;e of Men's Lives, and we &s;hall have abundant Rea|&s;on
<PB N="179" REF="005117_0095_1016A932922D7910">to fear that the greater Part are led away of their own Lu&s;ts, rather than by the Spirit of God. How many are carried away with Pride, how many with Covetou&s;ne&s;s, or an inordinate Love of the pre&s;ent World? And how many with Malice and Hatred, Di&s;content and Envy? Others we &s;hall &s;ee to be Lovers of Plea&s;ures more than Lovers of God, given up to Rioting and Drunkenne&s;s, Chambering and Wantonne&s;s, to Luxury, Idlene&s;s, and Sloth. And if we take away all &s;uch as are apparently &amp; evident|ly under the prevailing Power of &s;ome Lu&s;t or other, and add to them a great, tho' uncertain Number of clo&s;e Hypocrites, who make a good Appearance, but are really under the Power of their Lu&s;ts; and there will be found but a &s;mall Number of tho&s;e that are really and truly under the governing Influence of a divine and gracious Principle. There are great Numbers that are apparently and evidently in their Sins; and many more, who if they have a good Out|&s;ide; yet are rotten at the Heart. And now when all the openly Wicked, and all the refin'd Hypocrites are taken out, we &s;hall find but a &s;mall Number comparatively left: Oh how few, that love God with all their Heart and with all their Soul. How few that love their Neighbour as them&s;elves! What little Faith would Chri&s;t find upon the Earth, if he &s;hould now come?

If we judge Men by their Fruits, (and if we judge them at all it mu&s;t be by their Fruits) we &s;hall have a melan|choly View of Mankind, and &s;hall &s;ee the grea|te&s;t Part of Mankind under the Dominion of their Lu&s;ts, and but few comparatively under the gracious Influence of the Spirit.

<P>Inf. 3. <HI>Are the Children of God &s;o led by his Spirit, and governed by this gracious Prin|ciple as has been de&s;cribed? Hence then, how amiable and truly excellent are the Children of God!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="005117_0096_1016A9341A5466F8">
For wherever the Spirit of God takes Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, he begets the mo&s;t amiable and excellent Qualities plea&s;ing to God, lovely in the Eyes of Angels, and of all the Saints, and which indeed beget the Veneration and E&s;teem of all; Qua|lities which render them happy to them&s;elves, and comfortable to all that they have any Concern withal.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the Temper that is wro't by the Spirit of God in all his Children, and their Carriage and Behaviour con&s;equent here|upon, both towards God and towards Man, we may &s;ay with the Preacher, that the <HI>Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour.</HI> * Yea that the <HI>Saints</HI> are the <HI>only excellent ones in all the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>When we behold the Children of Men un|der the Ruins of the Fall, they appear vile de|formed Creatures indeed, more vile than the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h: And we can hardly conceive how beautiful and excellent a Creature he was, when he fir&s;t came out of his Creator's Hands, with the Image of God bright upon him.</P>
<P>But now when the Spirit of God re&s;tores the divine Image or gracious Principle to the Soul in any Mea&s;ure; then the Beauty and Glory of Man begins again to appear. And Oh the un|&s;peakable Difference between the Sinner and the Saint!<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. 12.26.</NOTE> One that is evidently under the

<P>Indeed this Difference at pre&s;ent is not &s;o con&s;picuous as is to be de&s;ired, becau&s;e of the Sin and Corruption that &s;till remain in God's Children, and too too often break forth in the very be&s;t of them.</P>
<P>But now let us con&s;ider the di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks of God's Children, and draw the Picture of a Saint, with only the&s;e general Characters that I have given as Signs of our being led by the Spirit of God, and are the very Lines which the divine Spirit draws upon every true Chri&s;|tian, and he will appear in a mo&s;t beautiful and amiable Light, he will appear glorious and ex|cellent.</P>
<P>Thus let us behold the Chri&s;tian convinced of Sin by the Spirit of God, truly humble and &s;orry for all his pa&s;t Sins, and hating every evil and fal&s;e Way, and reforming tho&s;e Things that are ami&s;s, and departing even from his own Iniqui|ty.</P>
<P>Let us view him al&s;o in his hearty Return to God, from whom he has revolted, and in his clo&s;e Attachment to him, loving him with all
<PB N="183" REF="005117_0097_1016A93704690740">his Heart and Soul, careful above every Thing to plea&s;e him, and fearful of offending him, aiming at his Honour and Glory in all he does, and placing all his Happine&s;s in the Enjoyment of him; going to him as his Father, acknow|ledging him in all his Ways, &s;eeking to him, and tru&s;ting in him for all he wants, and giv|ing him the Prai&s;e of all that he receives.</P>
<P>Again, Let us view him in his Union to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t by Faith, believing in him with all his Heart, as his only and all-&s;ufficient Saviour, renouncing all Confidence in him&s;elf, and in any Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own, depending upon being pardoned, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and accepted, only in and thro' this dearly beloved Son of God: And at the &s;ame Time his Heart &s;hew|ing forth the highe&s;t Love to the Lord Je&s;us, loving him above Father, and Mother, and Brethren, and Si&s;ters, and Hou&s;es, and Lands; yea and above his very Life, for the infinite Love he has &s;hewn to him.</P>
<P>Let us al&s;o view the Chri&s;tian in his earne&s;t De&s;ires and Endeavours to be as like to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; &s;triving after the &s;ame Mind, and Spirit, and endeavouring to tread in the &s;ame Steps.</P>

<P><PB N="184" REF="005117_0098_1016A93905BD44D0">
Let us view him acquie&s;cing in all the Di&s;|pen&s;ations of divine Providence, receiving Mer|cies thankfully, bearing Afflictions patiently, and whatever State and Condition he is in, therewith content.</P>
<P>Again, Let us view him in his &s;incere and undi&s;&s;embled Love to Mankind, loving his Neighbour as him&s;elf, dealing ju&s;tly with all Men, &s;peaking the Truth to his Neighbour, and doing &s;uch Acts of Piety and Kindne&s;s as he has Ability and Opportunity for. Let us view him feeding the Hungry, cloathing the Naked, relieving the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, in&s;tructing the Ignorant, &s;etting them to rights that are out of the Way, &s;ympathizing with all according to their Circum&s;tances, weeping with them that weep, and rejoicing with them that rejoice, and &s;tudying the Things that make for Peace, patiently bearing any Injuries and Abu&s;es, ra|ther than revenge them, and laying a&s;ide all Malice, and Guile, and Hypocri&s;ies, and En|vyings, and Evil-&s;peakings; being reviled he ble&s;&s;es, being per&s;ecuted he &s;uffers it, being defamed he intreats, and is gentle, and good, and kind, and faithful, and hone&s;t, and all cloathed and adorned with Meekne&s;s, Mode&s;ty and Humility.</P>
<P>But then finally, let us view the Chri&s;tian or Child of God in his Conduct and Management towards him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="005117_0098_1016A93905BD44D0">

Let us view him in his moderate U&s;e of all Things which God has given; in his being &s;ober, cha&s;te, and temperate in all Things.</P>
<P>And now I have recollected a few Hints from the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;es, which may go for a rough Draught of a Child of God, and are &s;ome of the general Lines which are drawn by the Spirit of God, upon the Soul and upon the Life of every gracious Saint.</P>
<P>And now, my beloved Brethren, what a Beauty, what a Brightne&s;s is there in every one of the&s;e Lines? And how amiable, lovely, and beautiful, mu&s;t the Man be that has the&s;e Cha|racters bright upon him? &mdash; Indeed the Un|happine&s;s is, that we hardly ever did &s;ee &s;uch an one, where all the&s;e Lines were &s;trong and clear; for the Ca&s;e with the be&s;t of Chri&s;tians among us is this, that altho' &s;ome of the&s;e Lines or Characters may be very con&s;picuous, yet others are weak and much ob&s;cured. The Sins and Corruptions that &s;till remain do &s;o blot and blur and &s;tain them, that &s;ome of them in &s;ome Chri&s;tians can hardly be perceived.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="005117_0099_1016A93D103FE980">
But now let us by what we have &s;een in &s;ome Chri&s;tians that have been eminent for &s;ome Graces, imagine a Saint with ALL the&s;e Cha|racters clear and &s;trong upon him; that is, let us imagine a Man as not only having all the&s;e Virtues and Graces of the Spirit, but as having them in a &s;trong, lively, and vigorious Exerci&s;e, and oh how glorious would he appear! Surely he would attract the Love, Delight and Com|placence of God him&s;elf; for he cannot but delight in the&s;e moral Virtues and Graces wherever he beholds them. And every Angel in Heaven, as well as every Saint on Earth, mu&s;t needs be in Love with &s;uch an one; nay, the very Devils, and wicked Men, would be forced to acknowledge him to be truly excellent and glorious.</P>
<P>Well then, altho' we may not expect to &s;ee &s;uch a perfect Man in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, as this, nor to attain to it our &s;elves, in the pre&s;ent State of Imperfection; yet let us a&s;pire after it, and de|&s;ire and endeavour to come as near to it as po&s;|&s;ible.

And therefore this is the fir&s;t and the grand Thing to be de&s;ired and &s;ought after by us; namely to be led by the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of God, to be impre&s;&s;ed with this divine and heavenly Principle. The great Thing we need, and which we &s;hould be mo&s;t of all de|&s;irous of is, that the Spirit of God might <HI>move</HI> upon <HI>our Hearts,</HI> with his almighty Energy, as he did upon <HI>the Face of the Waters</HI> at fir&s;t; re|moving that Corruption and Confu&s;ion that is upon them, rectifying the Di&s;orders that are within, and <HI>re&s;toring our Souls;</HI> that is, re&s;toring the divine Image, and all tho&s;e gracious Di&s;|po&s;itions and Habits which were lo&s;t by Sin: Which is the only &s;ure and certain Sign of our being the Children of God.</P>

<P>And now to this important Que&s;tion, I will an&s;wer in a few Particulars, by Way of Direc|tion, and &s;o conclude.</P>
<P>DIRECTION 1. <HI>You mu&s;t believe and be &s;en|&s;ible of the Need you &s;tand in of this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, to lead and govern you, and to work every Grace in you.</HI></P>
<P>Some Men have been &s;o ignorant of their own Weakne&s;s and Corruption, as to imagine that with the common Helps afforded them in the outward Means of Grace; they had Power enough of heir own to effect a gracious Change: That they could in the U&s;e of the&s;e Means convert and change them&s;elves, and put

<P>But now as &s;uch are gro&s;ly mi&s;taken, &s;o God oftentimes leaves &s;uch &s;elf-&s;ufficient, &s;uch &s;elf-confident Per&s;ons to them&s;elves, whereby they may be effectually convinced at length, (and oftentimes when it is too late) that they had not Power of their own to &s;tand; much le&s;s to do this and other Duties. And therefore &s;uch as are &s;o confident in their own Strength, are not likely to &s;eek for Help as they &s;hould, and &s;o not in a likely Way to have the Help of the Spirit afforded unto them.</P>
<P>Our Saviour told his Di&s;ciples <HI>that without him they could do nothing.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 15.5.</NOTE> We mu&s;t be &s;en|&s;ible that without the Help of his Spirit we can do nothing effectually in the Affair of our Souls.

Let Per&s;ons be but &s;en&s;ible that in their natural State they are weak and impotent, <HI>wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked;</HI> and then they are more ready to look to God for Help, more ready to receive it, and God more ready to be&s;tow it. <HI>The whole need not a Phy&s;ician, but they that are &s;ick; I am not come to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</HI>

DIREC. II. <HI>On the other Hand, you mu&s;t be|ware of looking upon your Impotency in &s;uch a View, and pre&s;uming &s;o much upon the Help of the Spirit; as to &s;it down in Sloth and Negligence.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;ome Men are vain in their Imaginations with Re&s;pect to the natural Powers of Men, and can't bear to think they are &s;o deba&s;ed and debilitated by the Fall, as really they are; but think they can do this, and the other by their own Power, without any &s;pecial Help of the Spirit; &s;o others are apt to run into the other Extreme, and from the Repre&s;entation that is made in Scripture of humane Weakne&s;s and Corruption &s;ince the Fall; but more e&s;pecially from &s;ome fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es that &s;ome have put upon certain metaphorical Expre&s;&s;ions in Scripture; and from the &s;trong, indi&s;creet, and indi&s;tinct Expre&s;&s;ions of &s;ome Teachers, concerning the Impotency of Men; I &s;ay, that from the&s;e Things, &s;ome have been ready to think that no|thing at all can be done by them, nor &s;o much as to be attempted by them; but will &s;it &s;till, waiting till the Spirit of God moves them; pleading that it is in vain to attempt to do any Thing before the Spirit helps them; yea, and that it would be a &s;inful pre&s;uming in their own Strength, to attempt any Thing before they find the Spirit helping them. And how com|mon a Plea is this with &s;ome Per&s;ons, when they are called upon to this and the other Duty,
<PB N="198" REF="005117_0105_1016A94B93D24B88">to &s;ay, I can do nothing of my &s;elf, I have no Power of my own, I am not &s;ufficient as of my &s;elf for a good Tho't; and how quietly and contentedly will &s;ome &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;it down in Sloth, and in the Neglect of Duty, with &s;uch a Plea as this, from Year to Year, pretending that they wait only for the Spirit of God to help them: When in Fact the Spirit of God has all the While been ready to help them, if they would but improve the Help that he &s;tood ready to afford them. And however &s;ome People may quiet them&s;elves in their Sloth and Negligence, from a Pretence of their Impotency, and how much &s;oever they may flatter them&s;elves that they give Glory to God, by pleading &s;uch a Weakne&s;s and In&s;ufficiency in them&s;elves; yet it will be very offen&s;ive to God, and a Means of provoking him to withold his Spirit from them, when they make u&s;e of this as an Argu|ment to encourage them&s;elves in Sloth and Neg|ligence.</P>
<P>For altho' I am fully per&s;waded that there is a moral Impotency in Men to that which is &s;piritually good, and that we indeed are not &s;uf|ficient of our&s;elves for a good Tho't; yet there is a natural Power &s;till left in Man to do many Things that are materially and externally good; &s;uch as to read, to hear, to attend the Wor&s;hip of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now therefore for any to neglect the&s;e ex|ternal Duties, under a Pretence that they can
<PB N="199" REF="005117_0105_1016A94B93D24B88">do nothing of them&s;elves, would be as much an Abu&s;e of the Doctrine of humane Impotency, as it would be for a Man, becau&s;e we are taught that <HI>in God we live, and move, and have our Be|ing,</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 17.28.</NOTE> to ly a Bed, and not &s;tir Hand or Foot, pleading that he moves in God, and that he can't move without him.</P>
<P>So that every one who makes u&s;e of Man's Impotency as a Plea for Idlene&s;s, Sloth and Neg|ligence, it is mo&s;t certainly an Abu&s;e of the Doctrine: But it rather affords an Argument for &s;triving. I don't mean in our own Strength, but in the Strength of the Lord; and we mu&s;t try and &s;ee whether God don't afford Help and Strength to us. For God is oftentimes &s;triving with Sinners under the Go&s;pel by his Spirit: And who can &s;ay, if they &s;hould attempt in any Duty, but that God will &s;et in with his holy Spirit and help them? What one Soul can &s;ay but that the Spirit of God &s;tands ready to help him, if he will but engage in any Duty. There|fore Men mu&s;t &s;ee what they can do, and go &s;o far as they find they have any Power, in&s;tead of &s;itting down in Sloth and Lazine&s;s. The Man with the withered Hand, when Chri&s;t bid him <HI>&s;tretch it forth,</HI> did not pretend to plead that he had not Power to &s;tretch it out, but believing that he who bid him &s;tretch it out; was able to &s;trengthen him to it, he attempted to &s;tretch it

And altho' we cannot challenge or demand the holy Spirit, becau&s;e we have a&s;ked it of God; yet we have great Encouragement
<PB N="203" REF="005117_0107_1016A9516CF191C8">to pray, and to hope for obtaining upon our Prayers, provided we have &s;incere De&s;ires in our Prayers. Indeed if we have any &s;incere De&s;ires they are &s;tirred up by this very Spirit. Accordingly &s;o far as you are enabled you mu&s;t de&s;ire this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit to be your Guide, Sancti|fier, and Comforter, and mu&s;t manife&s;t tho&s;e De&s;ires in Prayer to God: And if you dont de&s;ire &s;o much as you ought, you mu&s;t pray that you may de&s;ire it more. Prayer is a Duty that we can perform in &s;ome Sort; and if we can't of our&s;elves pray &s;o well as we &s;hould; let us pray as well as we can, and pray that God would enable us to pray better, and that is the likelie&s;t Way for us to pray better, and one of the be&s;t Methods we can take to obtain the holy Spirit in his gracious Influences. For as our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour repre&s;ents the Matter unto us, we may as certainly, yea much more cer|tainly depend upon our heavenly Father to give the holy Spirit to them that a&s;k, than upon our obtaining of our earthly Parents, any good Thing that we a&s;k of them. <HI>If ye being evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children; how much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that a&s;k him.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 11.13.</NOTE> So then we mu&s;t a&s;k this Spirit of God, and we can't ex|pect this Gift without a&s;king.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="005117_0108_1016A9544C6F9418">
Indeed &s;ome have &s;ugge&s;ted, as if it was a dangerous Thing to &s;et unconverted People, to praying for the holy Spirit: And others have &s;poken of it as a Matter of great Doubt with them, whether unconverted Per&s;ons ought to pray; by Rea&s;on of which &s;ome weak Minds that have been under Doubts as to their Regeneration, have been under Di&s;couragements as to the great Duty of Prayer. But he that ob&s;erves the Current of Scripture, will find that every Man is obliged to pray, and e&s;pecially to a&s;k for the holy Spirit, and for renewing Grace. As it is God's Pre|rogative to give a new Heart, and a new Spirit, and as he has promi&s;ed to give it unto his People, &s;o he expects that we &s;hould a&s;k it of him. <HI>A new Heart al&s;o will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, &mdash; and I will put my Spirit within you,</HI> &amp;c <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>to do it for them.</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ezek. 36.26, 27, 37.</NOTE> Surely then they were to a&s;k and pray for the&s;e &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings before they &s;hould obtain them. And this plainly &s;uppo&s;es, that Per&s;ons mu&s;t pray, mu&s;t &s;eek to God in order to obtain this great Ble&s;&s;ing of the Spirit. Moreover, if we may pray that <HI>God would create a clean Heart, and renew a right Spirit within us;</HI> we may pray before there is &s;uch a clean Heart and right Spirit created or renewed within us.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="005117_0108_1016A9544C6F9418">
But then if we pray for the Spirit of God, we mu&s;t labour to be earne&s;t and importunate in our Prayers. If we find our&s;elves cold, dull and lifele&s;s in praying for the Spirit of Grace; we mu&s;t pray that God would make us more ear|ne&s;t in our Prayers. We mu&s;t al&s;o &s;et our|&s;elves to con&s;ider the infinite Importance, and the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of our obtaining the ble&s;|&s;ed Spirit, and &s;o mu&s;t pray that whatever God denies us, he would not deny us his holy Spirit. You &s;hould endeavour that the Language of your Souls might be to this Purpo&s;e, <HI>Lord, as to outward and temporal Ble&s;&s;ings, I a&s;k them with Submi&s;&s;ion to thy wi&s;e and holy Will, whether to grant or to deny: But as to thy holy Spirit, I in|treat thee by no Means to deny it unto me, for with|out thy Spirit I &s;hall remain in a carnal corrupt E|&s;tate, and can never &s;ee thy Face, nor enjoy thy Fa|vour, but I mu&s;t be excluded thy Pre&s;ence for ever.</HI> And &s;o far as there is any Earne&s;tne&s;s and Im|portunity in your Prayers, &s;o far it is a Token for Good. For when God is about to give his holy Spirit in the gracious Influences thereof; he will &s;tir up &s;ome Earne&s;tne&s;s of De&s;ire, and will quicken us to call upon his Name.</P>
<P>DIREC. V. <HI>You mu&s;t readily acknowledge the Help and Influence of the Spirit, which you receive your &s;elves, and perceive in others; and give</HI> GOD <HI>the Glory of it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="005117_0109_1016A95707BA7848">
As we are to a&s;k for the Spirit, &s;o he is to be acknowledged in all his gracious Influences and Operations upon Men's Hearts, and if we ex|perience any Thing hereof in our &s;elves, in any lively Actings of Faith, and Love, or other Graces, or in any gracious Re&s;traints from Sin, or A&s;&s;i&s;tances to Duty, or in any true &s;piritual Joy: We mu&s;t not a&s;cribe tho&s;e Things to our &s;elves, but acknowledge them all to the Glory of God. We mu&s;t acknowledge with the A|po&s;tle, and &s;ay, <HI>By the Grace of God, I am what I am. &mdash;Not I, but the Grace of God which was with me.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 15.12.</NOTE> He which hath wrought us for the &s;elf &s;ame Thing, is God, who hath al&s;o given unto us the Earne&s;t of the Spirit.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.5.</NOTE> I live; never|thele&s;s not I; but Chri&s;t liveth in me.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 2.20.</NOTE> So when we &s;ee others evidently under the Influ|ences of this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, we ought, with them, to acknowledge it to the Prai&s;e of God. The Apo&s;tle ob&s;erved and declares concerning the converted <HI>Corinthians,</HI> that they <HI>were wa&s;hed, that they were ju&s;tified, that they were &s;anctified, in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us, and with the Spirit of our God.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 6.11.</NOTE> And whenever we perceive the Grace of God in any, we &s;hould <HI>magnify the Lord with them, and exalt his Name together.</HI></P>
<P>And by a thankful acknowledging of the Grace of God we receive our &s;elves, and per|ceive
<PB N="207" REF="005117_0109_1016A95707BA7848">in others, we are in the Way not only to &s;ecure what we have, of the divine and gracious Influences; but al&s;o to obtain farther Degrees of divine Grace. <HI>For to him that hath,</HI> that thankfully acknowledges what he has, and care|fully improves what he has, <HI>&s;hall be given, and he &s;hall have more Abundance.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matth. 13.12.</NOTE></P>
<P>But here we mu&s;t beware of Errors on the right Hand and on the left. As we mu&s;t be careful to give God the Glory of all his Grace, and mu&s;t take heed that we don't a&s;cribe any Thing to our &s;elves which is really the Work of the divine Spirit; &s;o we mu&s;t avoid the other Extreme, which is the a&s;cribing this and that to the divine Impul&s;e, and the gracious Influences of God's Spirit, which are really the Effect only of an enlivened Fancy, and warm Imagination; for this in the Conclu&s;ion may be as dangerous and fatal as the other. But Wi&s;dom is profita|ble, is nece&s;&s;ary to direct us in tho&s;e Things, and the holy Scriptures mu&s;t be our Guide.</P>
<P>And by this Rule we mu&s;t judge the Spirits, as well as our &s;elves; and judge of them by their Fruits, for by their Fruits it is that we can know and judge of them.</P>
<P>And here we may, from the Nature of the divine Spirit, as revealed in his Word, lay down this general Rule in the Matter, <HI>viz.</HI> That tho&s;e Things are to be attributed to the Spirit of God,
<PB N="208" REF="005117_0110_10166758A3801AB0">that plainly, clearly, and fully lead us to God, and Chri&s;t, and Holine&s;s, to Ju&s;tice, Truth, and Charity, to Sobriety, Cha&s;tity, and Humility. And that whatever Influence there is upon us, that don't plainly and fully lead us to the&s;e Things, whatever &s;pecious Appearance it may make at pre&s;ent, it is from &s;ome other Spirit than the Spirit of God, and may not be a&s;cribed to him.</P>
<P>DIREC. VI. <HI>You mu&s;t diligently attend upon all the in&s;tituted Means of Grace, wherein you may hope to meet with the Spirit of God in the gracious Influences thereof.</HI></P>
<P>It is in Concurrence with &s;ome outward Means of Grace that God for the mo&s;t Part works upon the Souls of Men, and makes u&s;e of them as the In&s;truments of our &s;aving Con|ver&s;ion to him. Thus the Word of God is very much made u&s;e of in the Hand of the Spi|rit, for the convincing and converting Sinners. <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 19.7.</NOTE> That is, in&s;trumentally by the Hand of the Spirit. For it is with the Word that he converts and regenerates the Soul. <HI>Of his own Will begat he us, with the Word of Truth.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">James 1.18.</NOTE> Surely then we ought to conver&s;e very much with the Word of God. We &s;hould read it, and hear it, with diligent Attention and clo&s;e
<PB N="209" REF="005117_0110_10166758A3801AB0">Application, and &s;hould meditate therein both Day and Night.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Goings of our God and King, are to be &s;een in his Sanctuary,</HI> and <HI>there he commands the Ble&s;&s;ing, even Life for evermore;</HI> &s;o we &s;hould be careful to go into his Tabernacle, and wor&s;hip at his Foot&s;tool. We mu&s;t attend the publick Wor&s;hip, and upon all the Ordi|nances of God's Hou&s;e, and in all tho&s;e Ways that he has appointed for us to meet with him. I &s;ay, all the Ways that he has appointed, for it is in the Ways of divine Appointment and In&s;titution that we may hope to meet with him, and with his Grace. And we mu&s;t be &s;teady and con&s;tant in attending upon religious Duties and Ordinances, and mu&s;t not &s;uffer our &s;elves to be ea&s;ily diverted from them. We may not for&s;ake the publick Wor&s;hip, and &s;tated Ordinances, or &s;eparate from chri&s;tian A&s;&s;em|blies where we have been won't to attend, without being able to give a good Rea&s;on there|for.</P>
<P>But then we mu&s;t not content our &s;elves with a bare external Attendance, (which I fear is the Ca&s;e of many) and the Rea&s;on why they have not met with the gracious Influences of the Spirit in Ordinances. But we mu&s;t give a clo&s;e and diligent Attention, with De&s;ires, Prayers, and Endeavours, that the End and De&s;ign of every Ordinance may be an&s;wered upon us.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="005117_0111_1016A95BC6234DE8">
In a Word, Let us remember and realize it, that the Spirit of God is always ready to ac|company all the in&s;tituted Means of Grace; and if we attend on them in a right Manner, they will be as &s;o many Channels or Conduit Pipes to convey the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, with all its Graces and Comforts into the Soul. With <HI>Joy may we draw Water out of the&s;e Wells of Salvation.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah 12.3.</NOTE> Surely then none of the&s;e Ordi|nances may be neglected, nor may they be at|tended in a carele&s;s cu&s;tomary Manner lea&s;t you mi&s;s of the Holy Spirit after all.</P>
<P>DIREC. VII. <HI>You mu&s;t take Heed of quench|ing the Spirit, and mu&s;t carefully comply with the Strivings thereof.</HI></P>
<P>This is the cautionary Advice of the Apo&s;tle, QUENCH NOT THE SPIRIT.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;. 5.19.</NOTE> And a very nece&s;&s;ary Caution it is: For by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t Motions of the Spirit, and by quench|ing the Sparks that began to kindle in the Soul, many a one has utterly lo&s;t the Spirit of God. He has been &s;o provoked hereat, as to with|draw, and has cea&s;ed to &s;trive with them any more. And if God in righteous Judgment &s;ometimes deals thus with tho&s;e that quench the Spirit, that don't carefully ob&s;erve the Dictates thereof, nor comply with its ble&s;&s;ed Motions; how much more will he be provoked to leave
<PB N="211" REF="005117_0111_1016A95BC6234DE8">&s;uch as do even <HI>re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, and do de&s;pite unto the Spirit of Grace?</HI> Oh then as ever you would obtain the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, you mu&s;t take Heed of grieving or provoking him, by re&s;i&s;ting him, or refu&s;ing to comply with him. You don't know what Hazzard you run every Time you quench or re&s;i&s;t the Spirit of God. And let me tell you, that if any of you finally mi&s;s of the Spirit of God, and die in your Sins, God will know it, and charge upon every one of you that you quenched his Spirit, that you grieved his Spirit, that you re&s;i&s;ted his Spirit, which will &s;top every Mouth, &s;o that you won't have a Word to &s;ay for your &s;elves in the Day of Judgment; but will condemn your &s;elves for refu&s;ing and re&s;i&s;ting the Spirit of God when he was offered to you. Well then as ever you would obtain the Spirit of God, &s;o as to be a &s;ure Token of your being the Children of God, you mu&s;t not re&s;i&s;t, but readily yield to the Strivings of the Spirit. You mu&s;t hearken to his Sugge&s;tions, and fall in with his ble&s;&s;ed Mo|tions. Whatever the Spirit of God &s;ugge&s;ts from the Word of God, as your Duty, and is prompting you unto, you mu&s;t comply there|with, without conferring with Fle&s;h and Blood, without con&s;ulting your carnal Ea&s;e or worldly Intere&s;t in the Matter. And by thus heark|ning to the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, and complying with the Motions thereof, you will have the Spirit come more and more powerfully upon your
<PB N="212" REF="005117_0112_1016A95FB22D1BA8">Souls, that at length you will be &s;o led and go|verned by this Spirit of God, as will be an Evi|dence that you are the Sons of God.</P>
<P><HI>And now to conclude the whole Subject.</HI></P>
<P>Let us all admire and adore the Riches of divine Grace, that God is plea&s;ed to take any of the rebellious Race of <HI>Adam,</HI> and admit them to all the glorious Privileges of his Children; that he has been plea&s;ed to &s;end his only begot|ten and dearly beloved Son to purcha&s;e &s;uch infinite Benefits for us; and that he has been plea&s;ed al&s;o to &s;end his holy Spirit, to make us the fit Objects of divine Love and Complacency, and to make us the fit Subjects of &s;ublime Fe|licity, and of immortal Happine&s;s. And now &s;ince this infinitely ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, in all his en|lightning, convincing, renewing, &s;anctifying, &s;aving and comforting Influences is revealed and offered in the Go&s;pel, and &s;ince the outward Means of Grace are &s;o freely enjoy'd, and the common Strivings of this Spirit, &s;o frequently experienced by us; Oh! let us take Care that we may not be of that unhappy Number <HI>who receive this Grace of God in vain. Look, look diligently, lea&s;t any of you &s;hould</HI> finally <HI>fail of the Grace of God.</HI></P>
<P>And here you may receive this as a Truth, and rely upon it, that altho' God be the &s;ove|reign Di&s;pen&s;er of his Grace; yet that if you
<PB N="213" REF="005117_0112_1016A95FB22D1BA8">fail of the Grace of God, fail of obtaining his Spirit to lead and guide you, as he does the Children of God, it will be your own Fault; and becau&s;e you have not done what you might have done, and ought to have done, for the obtaining this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit.</P>
<P>For if you are found without the Spirit of God and de&s;titute of &s;aving Grace at la&s;t, it will be becau&s;e of your Pride and Self-Conceit, that you pre&s;umed in your own Strength, and did not &s;uitably acknowledge the Need you &s;tood in of the Help of the Spirit, or you pre|&s;umed &s;o much upon the Help of the Spirit, as to lay a&s;ide all Endeavours of your own, or you have been &s;o carele&s;s about the Matter, as to re&s;train Prayer before God, and did not &s;eek to him for his Spirit, as you might have done. Or you have denied to the Spirit the Glory of his divine and gracious Influences, attributing tho&s;e Things which have really been wrought by the Spirit, to &s;ome other Cau&s;es. Or you have a&s;cribed that to the holy Spirit, which would have been derogatory to his Glory, ra|ther than for his Honour. Or you have neg|lected &s;ome of the Ordinances and Means of Grace which Chri&s;t has appointed. Or you have quenched the Spirit, and grieved him, and provoked his Departure. And now if the&s;e, and &s;uch like, be the real Rea&s;ons why any of you go without the Spirit of God, &s;urely you will have a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your own Guilt,
<PB N="214" REF="005117_0113_1016A9626FB4DC30">and will judge and condemn your &s;elves, and be obliged to acknowledge the Ju&s;tice of God in condemning you: And all the World will acknowledge the Ju&s;tice of the divine Proce|dure, and &s;ay, as in Rev. 16.5. <HI>Righteous art thou, O Lord, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t judged thus.</HI></P>
<P>Well then, you mu&s;t alter your Tho'ts, and alter your Cour&s;e as to tho&s;e Things, as ever you would have this Spirit of God to guide and govern you, and even in this you need the Help of the Spirit. Oh! then let us be &s;en&s;ible that we need the Spirit of God in every Thing, and that without him we can do nothing. Let us cry to God for his Spirit, and that whatever he denies, he would not deny us his Spirit, and that whatever he takes from us, he would not take away his holy Spirit from us. Plead with God as the P&s;almi&s;t did, <HI>Ca&s;t me not away from thy Pre&s;ence, take not thy Spirit from me.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 51.11.</NOTE> Oh let us beware of re&s;i&s;ting, grieving, or quenching this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit; for we don't know how &s;oon he may be provoked to depart: And wo unto us, if he depart from us. Let us then be thankful for every Striving of the Spirit, let us cheri&s;h every Motion, and comply with every Thing that this divine Spirit prompts us unto; endeavouring always to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Spirit of God and our own Spirits, between the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error.
