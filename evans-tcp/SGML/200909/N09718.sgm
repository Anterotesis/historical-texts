<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PROVIDENCE &s;eems to render the pre&s;ent publication nece&s;&s;ary. The intere&s;t of CHRIST'S kingdom, my own reputation, and the importunity of friends concurring, I could not with&s;tand the motion, although I am exceeding loth to engage in a religious controver&s;y in my advanced &s;tate of life. The fir&s;t of the&s;e E&s;&s;ays was thrown together in ha&s;te with|out &s;trict order or method, being partly collected, and partly what occurred to my mind in reading the &s;criptures; and in &s;o|lemn reflection. The other E&s;&s;ays (e&s;pe|cially the &s;econd and the la&s;t) were writ|ten with more deliberation, and are in the &s;ame method, and are nearly in the &s;ame words as they were delivered. The la&s;t piece which &s;hould have been more pro|perly the fir&s;t, in order to exact &s;tating of the controver&s;y, lays the foundation upon which the whole is built. But the rea&s;on of this was, that children's member&s;hip was acknowledged in the fir&s;t church-meetings, and accordingly my arguments were found|ed on this conce&s;&s;ion. But in the church-meetings la&s;t <HI>March,</HI> their member&s;hip, or at lea&s;t the continuance of it at adult age was openly denied; and all the relat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB REF="012367_0004_0F89253531FD64D0">they had to the church was &s;aid to be this, that they were <HI>laid under bonds</HI> to enter into covenant per&s;onally at adult age and to come to full communion; which if they failed to do, their relation to the church wholly cea&s;ed. This occa&s;ioned my la&s;t E&s;&s;ay. I have had thoughts of reducing the whole that I have &s;aid in the controver&s;y into one piece, which would have con&s;iderably &s;hort|ened the work: But this would have taken up as much time as the fir&s;t compo&s;ure, which I had not lei&s;ure for; and therefore the whole comes forth in the pre&s;ent form. Some of the &s;ame arguments recur in the following that were brought in the fir&s;t piece, but they are &s;et forth in a manner &s;o differing as &s;erves to throw light on the &s;ub|ject. I &s;hall conclude this Preface with one caution. That whereas &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions taken &s;ingly may &s;eem to carry the matter too far in favour of <HI>unregenerates (openly &s;uch)</HI> I de&s;ire the reader always to take &s;uch pa&s;|&s;ages in connection with what is &s;aid el&s;e|where, and then the &s;eeming repugnancy will wholly vani&s;h. I leave the whole to the Reader's candor; and hope the di|vine ble&s;&s;ing will attend it, as it was really meant to &s;erve the cau&s;e of CHRIST in a point which I apprehend of great im|portance.</P>

<HEAD>THE FIRST ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P>QUEST. WHETHER the practice of per&s;ons own|ing or renewing the covenant, and having bapti&s;m for their children, without coming immediately to full communion, be war|rantable?</P>
<P>Arguments for the affirmative.</P>
<P N="1">I. I THINK the famous Mr. <HI>Mitch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll</HI>'s argument unan&s;|werable. <Q>1&s;t. The whole vi&s;ible church under the new te&s;tament is to be baptized. 2d. If a man be once in the church (whether admitted at age or in infancy) no|thing le&s;s than cen&s;urable evil can put him out. 3d. If the parent be in the vi&s;ible church, his infant child is al&s;o.</Q></P>
<P>This was the chief argument that convinced Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible to get over this argument, but by &s;aying, that not coming immediately to the LORD'S table is a <HI>cen&s;urable</HI> evil, a &s;in that de&s;erves excommunication. But did any church ever hold this? Who has heard or read of any per&s;on's being laid under the church-cen&s;ure meerly on this account? I grant, that the <HI>contempt</HI> of this ordi|nance de&s;erves excommunication, but not the meer ab&s;tain|ing from it for a while. That may proceed from too high thoughts of the ordinance, and low thoughts of them&s;elves. To cut off &s;uch would be <HI>a breaking the brui&s;ed reed</HI> with a witne&s;s, as Mr. <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nard</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves in the church re|cords. We would bear with a communicant for not com|ing to the LORD'S table if he declares it is from &s;cruples of con&s;cience re&s;pecting his &s;tate, and not from contempt of the ordinance: Much more &s;hould we bear with a mem|ber,
<PB N="2" REF="012367_0006_0F892536DFADF088">that never communicated. Such &s;hould be dealt with in <HI>the mini&s;try of the word and from the pulpit,</HI> and not by church con&s;ure. They &s;hould not be treated as <HI>delinquent members</HI> (as in the ca&s;e of <HI>here&s;y</HI> or <HI>&s;candal</HI>) but be u&s;ed with all tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. All the arguments brought for infant bapti&s;m in ge|neral do prove that bapti&s;m ought to be admin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tred in the latitude pleaded for. The&s;e arguments all center in this, <HI>that if the parents be in the covenant, the children are &s;o like|wi&s;e, and &s;o ought to have the &s;eal of the covenant.</HI> Now it is granted on all hands, that the parents in que&s;tion are in the covenant, con&s;equently then children are &s;o too; why then &s;hould they not be baptized? To deny the validity of this way of arguing is to give up the cau&s;e entirely to the <HI>Ana|bapti&s;ts;</HI> and there is no way left to confute them, and their demand is ju&s;t when they call for a direct &s;cripture for infant bapti&s;m; as &s;ome demand a direct &s;cripture in this ca&s;e, which is exactly to tread in their &s;teps. In &s;hort, there is as much proof for this point, as for infant bapti&s;m; we argue by <HI>&s;cripture-con&s;equence</HI> both in the one ca&s;e and the &s;ame con&s;equences prove both points.</P>
<P N="3">III. CHRIST &s;ays, <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 16. <HI>Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r little children to come unto me, and forbid them no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; for of &s;uch as the kingdom of</HI> GOD, <HI>i. e.</HI> Such are of my church. (This is the ground of the rebuke.) The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the children in que&s;tion. They are the children of men le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, therefore members. And here we may ob&s;erve, That CHRIST was never &s;o angry with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d di&s;ciples upon any oc|ca&s;ion, as for this deba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring of the &s;ubjects of his Kingdom being brought to him. Let us fear le&s;t he be as angry with us, if we do the &s;ame. The di&s;ciples thought that they were not good men that brought the&s;e children; they ex|hibited no po&s;itive evidence of grace to their view; neither does CHRIST &s;o much as intimate that they were gracious. But the ground he &s;eems to go upon was, that as they were members of the church, they had a right to bring their children; thereby letting us know, that it is <HI>vi&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ber&s;hip</HI> gives the right. If you &s;ay, their bringing their children was evidence enough of their faith in CHRIST, the &s;ame I &s;ay of the per&s;ons in que&s;tion. If you &s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er, CHRIST would never have commended then for bringing their children, if they had not been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="3" REF="012367_0007_0F892537AB22F418">this is plainly begging the que&s;tion, and it renders CHRIST'S an&s;wer to the di&s;ciples improper, which &s;hould have been (according to their notion) an expre&s;s declaration of the <HI>pa|rent's fitne&s;s,</HI> and not of the <HI>children's intere&s;t in the covenant</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> vi&s;ible member&s;hip.</P>
<P N="4">IV. "When a man according to &s;cripture rule is be|come a member of the vi&s;ible church, and there is no rule in the word to ca&s;t him out of the church, &s;uch a per&s;on has a right to have his children baptized."</P>
<P N="5">V. If the&s;e per&s;ons are &s;ubject to the <HI>rod</HI> or to church-government, they are intitled to the <HI>privilages</HI> of CHRIST'S kingdom. We ought not to &s;eparate what God has joined together. And we have no bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>judge them that are with|out,</HI> as we really do if they are entitled to no privileges at all.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Tho&s;e that &s;ubmit to CHRIST'S <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> cannot with any colour of rea&s;on be excluded from <HI>di&s;ciple&s;hip.</HI> And if di&s;ciples, they have a right to bapti&s;m for their children. And here I would mention that famous text &s;o much alledg|ed by <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> and their opponents, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii. 20. <HI>Go di&s;ciple</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So the word runs in the original Greek.</NOTE><HI>all nations, baptizing them,</HI> &amp;c. Here infants (as part of <HI>nations</HI>) are to be <HI>di&s;cipled</HI> and <HI>baptized.</HI> And if <HI>di&s;|cipled,</HI> all the privileges of di&s;ciples belong to them; and when demanded (after they are grown up) cannot ju&s;tly be withheld from them, without they put a bar in their own way by their wickedne&s;s.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Their <HI>di&s;ciple&s;hip</HI> is al&s;o proved from &s;everal other texts by all the writers for infant bapti&s;m. To be <HI>di&s;cipled</HI> is to be admitted into CHRIST'S &s;chool and family in or|der to be taught when capable, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P N="7">VII. If you exclude baptized per&s;ons (of regular lives) from bringing their children to bapti&s;m, you treat them as <HI>Pagans</HI> and Infidels; you practically &s;ay, they have no part in the LORD; you in effect excommunicate them and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them all out of heaven; for there is no &s;alvation out of the church: You make them vi&s;ible members of Satan's kingdom; for there is no medium here, a man mu&s;t be of the one or the other.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. CHRIST &s;ays, <HI>feed my lambs;</HI> but this, in&s;tead of feeding them, is a thru&s;ting them out of the fold: In&s;tead of <HI>carrying them in our arms</HI> we cut off their heads. And how dreadful is the thought!</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="4" REF="012367_0008_0F8925385C1DA1C0">
IX. If this rigid principle &s;hould prevail, in a few years (according to human pro&s;pect) nine tenths of the inhabitants will be in the condition of <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Infidels;</HI> and even the name of Chri&s;tianity will be in danger of being lo&s;t among this people.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>It is to me a confirmation to ob&s;erve <HI>de facto</HI> (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Mitchell</HI>) that in the way of <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive baptizing</HI> the chil|dren of all that had a &s;tanding in the <HI>vi&s;ible church</HI> (though with too much <HI>laxne&s;s</HI> and <HI>corruption</HI> for want of <HI>di&s;cipline</HI>) the LORD hath continued <HI>religion</HI> among <HI>chri&s;tian people</HI> from age to age: Whereas the like con|tinuance and pre&s;ervation of true religion could not have been hoped for, nor probable in the contrary way. It was never heard of in the world from <HI>Abra|ham</HI> to this day (&s;ince GOD appointed an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ing &s;ign,</HI> or &s;uch <HI>a livery to be worn by his people to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the world;</HI>) that a people did continue for any length of time to be religious, who were either all, or the greater part of them <HI>uncircumci&s;ed</HI> or <HI>unbapti&s;ed.</HI> The laying a&s;ide of <HI>circumci&s;ion</HI> among the <HI>Midianites.</HI> (for they did by times lay it a&s;ide, may be plainly ga|thered from <HI>Exod.</HI> iv. 24, 26.) was quickly followed with the utter lo&s;s of all true religion among them, and other of the po&s;terity of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Keturah.</HI> I know the bare having of bapti&s;m does not always keep true religion; but &s;ure it is, that the <HI>want of it</HI> will quickly lo&s;e religion among a people. To &s;ay that a people may be religious well enough without bapti&s;m. would be to reflect upon the wi&s;dom of CHRIST, in appointing &s;uch an <HI>external &s;ign</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> which &s;urely was no needle&s;s thing. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that in the way your&s;elf and &s;ome others go, <HI>the bigger half of the people in this country will in a little time be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n-bapti&s;ed.</HI></Q>
<BIBL>Letter to <HI>Inc. Mather,</HI> p. 4. 5.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>But this would be better (&s;ome &s;ay) than <HI>to come with a lie in their mouths.</HI> I an&s;wer, they do not come with a lie in their mouths, if they act con&s;cientiou&s;ly in what they do, if they come out of a &s;en&s;e of the command, and if (as far as they know their own hearts) they are &s;incere in what they profe&s;s, though they cannot &s;ay it is a <HI>gracious fincerity.</HI> It is the <HI>wilful hypocrite</HI> that lies to GOD and per|jures him&s;elf, who (con&s;cious of his in&s;incerity) does all to be &s;een of men, &amp;c. I am per&s;uaded and it may be ea&s;ily proved from the word of GOD, that the former &s;ort do not offend GOD &s;o much by coming in this manner though they have no real grace, as they would do by wholly neglecting the duty. The total neglect is wor&s;e than the undue per|formance. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid of every duty.</P>
<P>This makes way for the con&s;idering &s;ome other objections.</P>
<P N="1">I. It is objected, but the&s;e per&s;ons do not come imme|diately to the LORD'S &s;upper; and therefore they ought to be &s;hut out from other privileges until they will partake of the whole. I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The church in all ages has been larger in admitting to bapti&s;m, than the LORD'S &s;upper. In the primitive church there were three &s;orts.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. <HI>Catechumeni</HI> or well di&s;|po&s;ed <HI>Heathens</HI> under in&s;truction.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. <HI>Initiati</HI> or baptized per&s;ons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. <HI>Confirmati,</HI> confirmed members. They u&s;ed to baptized, before they admitted them to the holy my&s;teries.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<PB N="5" REF="012367_0009_0F89253910584BB0">And I might prove the point from the practice of all chur|ches &s;ince; but it would take up too long a time.</P>
<P N="2">2d. I would mention &s;ome maxims or principles of fa|mous divines, which carry their own weight with them. As
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. Bapti&s;m belongs to the di&s;ciples as &s;uch; the LORD'S &s;upper to <HI>&s;elf-examining</HI> di&s;ciples.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. Bapti&s;m is a &s;a|crament of initiation or entrance into the church; the other of confirmation or growth in grace.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. Member&s;hip in the univer&s;al church gives a right to bapti&s;m; but member|&s;hip in a particular church to the LORD'S &s;upper. Tho&s;e that the Apo&s;tles baptized as it were at large, mu&s;t be join|ed to a particular church before they could receive the LORD'S &s;upper.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. Covenant intere&s;t alone giveth right to bapti&s;m, but not to the LORD'S &s;upper. It is a great mi&s;take to think, that the parents <HI>immediate fitne&s;s</HI> for the LORD'S &s;upper is the ground of baptizing their children; but it is the parents and &s;o the childrens being in the covenant. We often have rea&s;on to think that &s;ome communicante are <HI>unfit</HI> for the LORD'S &s;upper; but we cannot exclude them from that ordinance or from bapti&s;m for their children, being neither heretical or &s;candalous. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e they are under the covenant. The &s;ame may be &s;aid in the other ca&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5th. <HI>That uncleanne&s;s</HI> would debar from coming to the pa&s;&s;over, which did not unfit for the other ordinance of cir|cumci&s;ion.
<PB N="6" REF="012367_0010_0F892539D1D4DD78">The&s;e &s;everal particulars import, that we &s;hould not be altogether &s;o <HI>&s;trict</HI> in admi&s;&s;ion to bapti&s;m, as to the LORD'S &s;upper.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="3">3d. I an&s;wer, "A mans not joining to a particular church may be owing to the <HI>weakne&s;s of his tender con&s;cience,</HI> which &s;crupleth his fitne&s;s for the LORD'S &s;upper; and yet would gladly have him&s;elf and his con&s;ecrated to the LORD, yea and rejoice to be under the government and laws of CHRIST in particular churches."</P>
<P N="4">4th. If the knowledge of a man's good e&s;tate (as they hold) is a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for the LORD'S &s;upper, it is his duty to &s;tay away until he has this knowledge; and yet not neglect other duties in the mean time.</P>
<P N="5">5th. If &s;uch per&s;ons are real and hearty in renewing co|venant they will &s;oon come further; if they are not, they had better remain where they are. It will be more for the honour of the church; for how often do tho&s;e who are only under a common work of the &s;pirit, lo&s;e their convictions, and (by their apo&s;tacy) become a &s;candal to religion and to the church that admits them? And hence we may &s;ee the impropriety of vehemently urging per&s;ons to come imme|diately into full communion, when they do not find a <HI>free|dom</HI> in them&s;elves to do it.</P>
<P N="6">6th. We ought rather to encourage per&s;ons to come as far as they &s;ee light in the path of duty, than to lay di&s;cou|ragements and &s;tumbling-blocks in their way. This is truly to <HI>carry the lambs in our arms.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. It is objected, But if all baptized per&s;ons are members already, why do they own the covenant? Is it not that, that makes them members? I an&s;wer, no: A per&s;on doth not become any more a member than he was before by renew|ing the covenant. It is only a recognition or taking po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his right in the manner the church thinks proper. It is like an officer's taking an oath for the faithful di&s;|charge of his office: It is not the <HI>oath</HI> that con&s;titutes the office, but the <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> which he had before. There is no impropriety in calling all baptized per&s;ons <HI>compleat mem|bers,</HI> as our ancient Divines and the Synod expre&s;&s;ly do. Member&s;hip is a thing that cannot be increa&s;ed or dimini&s;h|ed; there is no <HI>magis</HI> or <HI>minus</HI> (more or le&s;s) here: A man is a member or no member; there is no medium: But their CAPACITIES of ACTING are not the &s;ame; they may be
<PB N="7" REF="012367_0011_0F89253A93E834E8">widely different. An infant or a communicant (become <HI>non-compos</HI>) cannot receive the LORD'S &s;upper; yet they are compleat members. And there is no &s;uch a thing as <HI>halfmem|ber&s;hip</HI> or <HI>half-covenanting,</HI> and it is injurious to u&s;e &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion. But what advantage is it to renew covenant then? I an&s;wer, This is a <HI>meer prudential</HI> of the church, to make the more <HI>deep</HI> and more <HI>durable</HI> impre&s;&s;ions on the per&s;ons concerned; to give them proper ideas of the &s;olemnity of the affair; and al&s;o to impre&s;s on others a &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of their covenant-engagements, by a repetition of the covenant in their hearing. They have the &s;ame end in it that whole churches have, when they renew covenant <HI>openly</HI> and <HI>expli|citly,</HI> as the churches were wont to do formerly, and this church more than once in my Grandfather's days. But it never entered into their hearts, that they made any <HI>additi|on</HI> to their member&s;hip by it. So it is in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. I am &s;orry to &s;ee that this cu&s;tom of renewing covenant is &s;o mi&s;under&s;tood by many; they &s;eem to have got a notion, that by renewing covenant they are made members. But this is a mi&s;take; they are no more members than they were before: And the practice had better be laid a&s;ide, than to be thus abu&s;ed by &s;uch gro&s;s apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P N="3">III. But it is further objected, it is only <HI>grace</HI> that gives a right to either &s;eal; and therefore a per&s;on ought not to come until he knows his grace. I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. This objection doth not reach the ca&s;e of tho&s;e that were baptized in infancy; but tho&s;e only that come for bapti&s;m at adult age. The former are members already, and therefore if we go to <HI>purge</HI> the church of them, or re|fu&s;e to let them renew covenant, (which is the &s;ame thing) let them be ever &s;o blamele&s;s in their walk, we mu&s;t go fur|ther &s;till, and purge the communicants likewi&s;e (who re|new covenant every time they come to the &s;acrament) and turn out all that we think have not grace, or that dare not &s;ay they are converted. And where we mu&s;t &s;lop no man can &s;ay. In &s;hort, this is running directly into the mo&s;t rigid principles of the <HI>Separates,</HI> who are for purging the church. We have no more warrant to ca&s;t baptized per&s;ons out of the church than communicants: And if we do the one we mu&s;t do the other al&s;o, when there is the &s;ame ground for it, that is, rea&s;on to fear they are gracele&s;s. Indeed if <HI>here&s;y</HI> or <HI>&s;can|dal</HI> can be proved upon either &s;ort, let them be ca&s;t out in GOD'S name; but not otherwi&s;e.</P>

2d. The&s;e Per&s;ons in que&s;tion exhibit tho&s;e <HI>&s;igns of grace</HI> which our opponents &s;et up as the <HI>only &s;tandard</HI> for the church to judge by. They explode an account or <HI>relation</HI> of expe|riences, at lea&s;t think them unnece&s;&s;ary; and make pro|fe&s;&s;ion and practice the only criterion of judgment. Thus Mr. <HI>Green,</HI> one of the <HI>Connecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t</HI> champions for the new &s;cheme; he &s;ays in his late treati&s;e, p. 57.8 <Q>In the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons, we are not to judge from the account of <HI>inward experiences:</HI> This is not laid down in &s;cripture as the rule of publick judgment, but profe&s;&s;ion and prac|tice.</Q> To this we entirely agree with re&s;pect to <HI>bapti&s;m.</HI> Why then will they not &s;uffer per&s;ons of <HI>regular practice</HI> to renew the covenant, when they de&s;ire it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or in other words, to add profe&s;&s;ion to their practice, which (according to them, is all that is nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;o to have bapti&s;m for their children? this would put an end to the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Here, by the way, I cannot help ob&s;erving, how ridicu|lous it is to in&s;i&s;t that none but <HI>gracious per&s;ons</HI> ought to par|take of the &s;eals; and yet at the &s;ame time to &s;ay, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to give an account of the <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings of grace in their &s;ouls,</HI> which is what we call experiences. This &s;eems to me to be a direct contradiction. Such an account is really <HI>e&s;|&s;ential</HI> to their &s;cheme; and if &s;eparated from it, it falls to the ground; and they really (after all their noi&s;e about grace) take up with le&s;&s;er evidences than we do in regard of the LORD'S &s;upper.</P>
<P N="3">3d. If this doctrine be true, then it will follow, that no believer while in the dark ought to come to either ordi|nance, or even pre&s;ent his child to bapti&s;m; for then he implicitly renews covenant; which mu&s;t not be done in a &s;tate of darkne&s;s. And what confu&s;ion would this bring into the church? We &s;hould have but thin communions, it the members every time they come mu&s;t know they have grace.</P>
<P N="4">4th. According to this &s;cheme, no per&s;on ought to en|gage in any duty what&s;oever, until he knows he has grace. For he is in danger of <HI>lying to</HI> GOD, or dealing <HI>fal&s;ely</HI> in the di&s;charge of it; which is the grand objection in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5th. According to this &s;cheme, <HI>Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> were to blame for bringing their peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in general to renew co|venant, when they had rea&s;on to &s;ear that the greater part
<PB N="9" REF="012367_0013_0F89253CD1624588">of them would come with <HI>a lye</HI> in their mouths, and they had better have let it alone.</P>
<P N="6">6th. I have ob&s;erved before; if per&s;ons know not that they have grace, yet are con&s;cious of their &s;incerity in what they do, they had better come than &s;tay away. And if they &s;hould be really de&s;titute of grace, their coming will be le&s;s offen&s;ive to GOD than the omi&s;&s;ion would be. Refor|mation and renewings of covenant when only proceeding from a common work of GOD'S &s;pirit, have been a means of removing or preventing judgments, as is evident from many places of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>And here I would mention one thing; I &s;hould be glad to hear as much of the danger of the <HI>total omi&s;&s;ion</HI> of the&s;e duties, as of the performing them in a <HI>wrong manner.</HI> The <HI>Jew</HI> that did not circumci&s;e his child was to be <HI>cut of from</HI> GOD's <HI>people, i. e.</HI> put to death: But no &s;uch &s;evere judg|ment was threatned again&s;t the unregenerate per&s;on, that circumci&s;ed his child. And <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf had like to have lo&s;t his life, for the omi&s;&s;ion of this duty.</P>
<P N="7">7th. <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t and CHRIST'S di&s;ciples did not a&s;k tho&s;e they baptized, whether they knew they had grace. But upon <HI>their confe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins</HI> and promi&s;ing reformation, they immediately baptized them, <HI>Matt.</HI> 3, 6.</P>
<P N="8">8th. If this church &s;hould agree to renew covenant at this day openly and explicitly as churches did formerly for the &s;trengthening their covenant engagements, it would be proper and nece&s;&s;ary to call upon all the children of the church to join with us in it, as our Fathers did, as we may find on our church-records. And who in this ca&s;e would dare to forbid or exclude them, though they did not come immediately to the LORD'S table? And if not why &s;hould they be excluded when they come <HI>ous by one?</HI></P>
<P N="9">9th. If the knowledge of our good e&s;tate be nece&s;&s;ary in order to partaking of the &s;eals, it mu&s;t amount to a <HI>certain</HI> knowledge. For how can a <HI>meer hope</HI> entitle us to it? How know we but it is the hope of the hypocrite? Sup|po&s;e a king &s;hould give &s;uch and &s;uch privileges to per&s;ons &s;o and &s;o qualified, it will not do for per&s;ons to come and &s;ay they <HI>hope</HI> they have tho&s;e qualifications; they mu&s;t <HI>cer|tainly</HI> make out to their own and others &s;atisfaction that they have them, or they have no bu&s;ine&s;s to put in their claim. So that this doctrine is come to this at la&s;t, that
<PB N="10" REF="012367_0014_0F89253D8C14CDD0">nothing but <HI>full a&s;&s;urance</HI> will warrant our coming either to bapti&s;m or the LORD'S &s;upper. And if we have this before we come, what need we come at all? At lea&s;t we need not come for this end, to get our evidences and comforts &s;treng|thened; they being already come to their full &s;trength.</P>
<P N="4">IVth objection. But why do you exclude any baptized per&s;on at all from bringing their children to bapti&s;m, if they are all members? I an&s;wer, the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e of their vicious lives. If a per&s;on be a lyar, &s;wearer, &s;abbath-breaker, whoremonger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he ought to be dealt with, and if he re|main impenitent to be cut off. In this ca&s;e he forfeits his privilege. And this is the rea&s;on why per&s;ons are propound|ed, that if any know they are guilty of &s;uch things, they may object and get them excluded.</P>
<P N="5">Vth and la&s;t objection. This will bring in impurity into the church. I an&s;wer, Diligent attendance to di&s;cipline, and not <HI>curtailing the covenant</HI> will keep the churches pure. The contrary doctrine rather tends to impurity: For per|&s;ons, if debarred from renewing covenant and bringing their children, will be tempted from their great fondne&s;s for their offspring, to come too ra&s;hly to the LORD'S table. And the church will likewi&s;e be tempted to be <HI>lax</HI> in their admi&s;|&s;ions, to prevent the complaints of &s;uch per&s;ons, and to re|move the reproach that &s;uch &s;warms of children among them are in a &s;tate of <HI>heatheni&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>Several other weighty con&s;iderations might have been mentioned, but I forbear. I &s;hall firi&s;h with ob&s;erving, That this was the principle of almo&s;t all the fir&s;t Fathers in the country; my Great-grandfather <HI>Cotten,</HI> Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> the famous Mr. <HI>Shepard,</HI> Me&s;&s;i'rs <HI>Wil&s;on, Mather, Allen, Rogers,</HI> and many others. And the practice was recommended by a <HI>Synod</HI> of all the churches of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Colony in the year 1662. And it was agreeable to the &s;entiments of my Grandfather <HI>Cotton</HI> the former Mini&s;ter of this church, as I find by a manu&s;cript written by his own hand. And it has been practi&s;ed by the generality of the churches for more than an hundred years pa&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P>Further CONSIDERATIONS illu&s;trating the point.</P>
<P N="1">I. IF the foundation be taken away, what will the righ|teous do? What &s;ignifies it to keep contending who are the church, or who &s;hall or &s;hall not be received, when the very foundation of the church is &s;truck at, though not de&s;ignedly? We are in reality no church, nor any of us members of a church, if this propo&s;ition be not true, <HI>That the&s;e who are in the vi&s;ible covenant have a right to the &s;eal of the covenant for them&s;elves and children.</HI> The very being of the church depends upon it; the whole controver&s;y turns here: If it be denied, our cau&s;e is betrayed to the <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> and we cea&s;e to be a church: If it be granted, then our op|ponents give up their cau&s;e, and the children in que&s;tion are to be baptized. It is &s;trange therefore that this way of ar|guing is &s;o little taken notice of, when every thing dear to us plainly depends upon it.</P>
<P N="2">II. Upon the &s;ame foundation I argue, If the church &s;hould vote to di&s;annul this practice, I &s;hould think they wholly di&s;annulled <HI>infant bapti&s;m;</HI> for the ground of it would be wholly taken away: If this way of arguing be not conclu|&s;ive, <HI>they that are in the covenant have a right to the &s;eal of it for them&s;elves and children,</HI> there is no defence again&s;t them left, and we become downright <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> without knowing it; at lea&s;t we hold <HI>infant bapti&s;m</HI> by meer tradition, without un|der&s;tanding the grounds of it.</P>
<P>No doubt it will be &s;aid in an&s;wer to this, That, as according to the con&s;titution of the churches, a per&s;on has no imme|diate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight to bring his children to bapti&s;m notwith&s;tanding he was baptized in infancy, until he has &s;olemnly renewed the covenant; and this the church ought not to &s;uffer until they are fully &s;atisfied he has grace. I an&s;wer, The foun|dation of this objection was taken away in my fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay; in which I ob&s;erved,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. That this renewing covenant did not make them any more members than they were before: but was only a taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their right in the manner the church thought fir.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. That this taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion could not be denied them, unle&s;s <HI>here&s;y</HI> or <HI>&s;candal</HI> could be
<PB N="12" REF="012367_0016_0F89254036CE1B08">proved upon them. And now add,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. That no other evi|dences of grace are nece&s;&s;ary with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who are members already, than meer <HI>negative ones,</HI> unle&s;s the church a&s;&s;ume an authority of purging the church upon the plan of the <HI>Separates.</HI> As negative evidences are &s;ufficient in regard of tho&s;e already in full communion, &s;o al&s;o with re&s;pect to the&s;e in que&s;tion. I al&s;o add,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. There is no <HI>divine ap|pointment,</HI> that per&s;ons &s;hould renew covenant in this <HI>explicit manner,</HI> when they become adult; but it is a <HI>meer prudential</HI> of the church to make the more &s;olemn impre&s;&s;ions.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Ac|cordingly I find, that the two famous Mr. <HI>Henrys</HI> (Father and Son) did not propo&s;e any <HI>explieit covenant</HI> to baptized per&s;ons in publick at adult age: So far were they from thinking it <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to member&s;hip. And we read nothing of circumci&s;ed <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> thus renewing covenant in order to partake of any of the privileges of that church. But yet there is great propriety in it for the end ju&s;t mentioned. And if the church &s;hould order a general explicit owning the covenant by us all every time we come to the &s;acrament or once a year, there would be nothing ami&s;s in it, but it would tend to make the greater impre&s;&s;ions, though not make us more members.</P>
<P N="3">III. We find in &s;cripture, that all the <HI>I&s;racliti&s;h</HI> nation, old and young, were <HI>baptized</HI> by GOD him&s;elf <HI>in the cloud and in the &s;ea,</HI> I <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 2. Here the <HI>children</HI> of unregenerate per&s;ons had this rite admini&s;tred to them by the highe&s;t au|thority; and it was afterwards ble&s;t to them, though the parents were cut off. From this we may infer, that it is not contrary to the mind of GOD that children of per&s;ons unregenerate &s;hould have this ordinance admini&s;ted to them, if their parents be in covenant relation to him. This &s;eams to be a <HI>type</HI> of what was to be done in go&s;pel times. The Apo&s;tle plainly &s;peaks of it in allu&s;ion to the chri&s;tian bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I cannot be of the &s;entiments of tho&s;e that are for altering the practice, unle&s;s I held that baptized infants are no members; or if they were, they lo&s;e their member|&s;hip when they grow up, unle&s;s they come to the LORD'S table. They would be con&s;i&s;tent, though not true. But to grant that they were members then, and continue mem|bers &s;till, and as &s;uch ought to be dealt with for mi&s;de|meanors, and yet that their children are not members and have no right to the feal, is a &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency, and what can never be it reconciled.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="012367_0017_0F892541CBC1B078">
<Q>As all children are part of their parents, and make but one per&s;on by the laws of GOD and men; &s;o chri&s;tian infants are one per&s;on with their chri&s;tian parents, and make but one body with them, as the root and bran|ches are but one tree; and this by divine ordination, and e&s;pecially in obligations to duties, and right unto fa|vours and privileges &s;piritual, &s;o far as they are capable. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leigh</HI>'s Sy&s;tem of Divinity.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P N="5">V. If the church &s;hould alter this practice, what would become of tho&s;e who have already owned the covenant? part of their children baptized and part unbaptized, when they have the &s;ame right they had before: A motley mix|ture indeed, part of the church and part of the world. Here would be an excommunication with a witne&s;s.</P>
<P>But they may be remedied by looking upon them as per|&s;ons in full communion, and allowing them without further ceremony to come to the LORD'S table: But this cannot be right. For, 1&s;t. This would be to give them a privilege which they neither a&s;k for or de&s;ire, and perhaps will not con&s;ent to. Such may properly be called <HI>pre&s;&s;ed men,</HI> not <HI>voluntiers</HI> in GOD'S &s;ervice.</P>
<P N="2">2d. To be members in full communion and not com|municants is a contradiction in terms.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Here will be &s;ome in full communion that never made any relation of their acquaintance with experimental religion, which will either make two &s;orts of members in full communion, the one admitted without a relation and the other with; or it will cau&s;e the total laying a&s;ide the relation of experiences. In the former ca&s;e, what con|fu&s;ion will it make in the church, relations exacted from one &s;ort and not from the other? In the latter ca&s;e, the total laying a&s;ide of relations would deprive the church of one proper means of judging of their good e&s;tate. Without &s;ome account of their &s;en&s;e of divice things we &s;hall not know but all their religion is a piece of <HI>mechani&s;m,</HI> meerly external: We &s;hall have nothing left to judge by but <HI>blamele&s;ne&s;s of life,</HI> which all acknowledge may be &s;eparate from grace; and as to many we &s;hould have no more than <HI>negative</HI> evidences of grace, that is, that we never heard any thing bad of them, their manner of life being little known to the greater part of the church, which mu&s;t be frequently the ca&s;e in great towns. This would do upon Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI>'s &s;cheme, that the LORD'S &s;upper was a <HI>converting ordinance,</HI> and to be u&s;ed, by re|gular
<PB N="14" REF="012367_0018_0F8925420B6F8938">livers, as the other means of grace: But for tho&s;e that hold that the church &s;hould receive none but <HI>gracious per&s;ons,</HI> for them to con&s;ent to aboli&s;h relations, and to make &s;uch negative and external evidences the only &s;tandard of judg|ing appears to me a palpable contradiction. With regard to <HI>relations,</HI> I acknowledge that &s;ome of them are not very edifying, and others are too particular; we do not want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> man to give a hi&s;tory of his life: But for the Mini&s;ter to pen down &s;ome of the principal an&s;wers to the que&s;tions pro|po&s;ed by him to candidates, expre&s;&s;ing their &s;en&s;e of the evil of &s;in, love to CHRIST, and the like e&s;&s;ential acts of grace would be far from being u&s;ele&s;s and unedifying, e&s;pecially in &s;ome remarkable in&s;tances.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The children of tho&s;e in the covenant are God's; <HI>they are born unto me,</HI> &s;ays God; <HI>they are my children. Ezek.</HI> xvi. 20, 21. That is, within my church and covenant: This is &s;poken of the children of unregerate <HI>I&s;raelites.</HI> Certainly then we rob God of his portion, if we deny them the &s;eal; and there will be no difference between the infants of &s;uch as are in covenant, and the infants of <HI>Turks,</HI> which is not to be admitted: God him&s;elf claims a right to the one, but not to the other.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It is the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI>'s grand plea again&s;t baptizing infants, that they do not exhibit any po&s;itive evidences of grace.</P>
<P>And how do the&s;e that are for the new &s;cheme tally with them? Negative evidences are &s;ufficient in both ca&s;es. As bapti&s;m is a &s;acrament of <HI>entrance;</HI> &s;o the lowe&s;t degree of evidence is to be admitted in this ca&s;e. Certainly fuller evidences are to be expected from tho&s;e that are admitted to the <HI>table,</HI> than from tho&s;e that only approach the <HI>thre&s;hold;</HI> from <HI>proficients</HI> than <HI>incipients</HI> or fir&s;t beginners at CHRIST'S &s;chool.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> and others inform us, that the <HI>primitive church</HI> admini&s;tred the holy communion to newly baptized infants, after the example of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church, all their circumci&s;ed children eating the pa&s;&s;over with their parents. This practice was as early as St. <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s time, who liv|ed about 240 or 250 yeare after CHRIST, and for aught ap|pears much earlier; and it was continued univer&s;ally in the church above 600 years, and in &s;ome of the <HI>ca&s;tern</HI> chur|ches it continues to this day: St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> writes in defence of it. But although we judge them wrong in this, becau&s;e infants are uncapable of <HI>examining them&s;elves</HI> or of <HI>di&s;cerning
<PB N="15" REF="012367_0019_0F892545A39F5E98">the</HI> LORD<HI>'S body:</HI> Yet from this practice we may infer that it was their general &s;en&s;e that baptized per&s;ons meerly by virtue of their bapti&s;m, were intitled to all church privileges, and that nothing but their open wickedne&s;s could ju&s;tly debar them from it.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Tho&s;e who oppo&s;e this practice, lay the whole &s;tre&s;s of the controver&s;y upon this, that bapti&s;m is the &s;eal of the covenant of grace; con&s;equently, &s;ay they, none but <HI>gracious per&s;ons</HI> have a right to partake of it, and if they have grace, they ought al&s;o to come to the LORD'S &s;upper, which is another &s;eal of the covenant; and it is wrong to admit any adult per&s;on to the one, without they will immediately come to the other: The &s;eals are not to be divided.</P>
<P>It is granted on all hands that bapti&s;m is a &s;eal of the co|venant of grace: The <HI>Synod</HI> that recommended the pre&s;ent practice univer&s;ally held this; and &s;o did the two Dr. <HI>Ma|thers,</HI> Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> and others, and &s;o did Mr. <HI>Leonard;</HI> and yet they were all zealous for admini&s;tring bapti&s;m in this latitude; they could &s;ee no incon&s;i&s;tency between the&s;e two principles. But how can they be reconciled? An&s;. 1&s;t. They admitted the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> evidences of grace, even nagative ones, and &s;uppo&s;ed them &s;ufficient with re&s;pect to tho&s;e already in covenant. And to prevent <HI>&s;candalous</HI> per&s;ons from bringing their children to bapti&s;m, they were always propounded before hand, that objections might in that ca&s;e be made again&s;t their coming.</P>
<P N="2">2d. With re&s;pect to tho&s;e <HI>without,</HI> that offered them&s;elves to bapti&s;m at adult age, they admitted the fir&s;t dawnings and glimmerings of <HI>good</HI> as intitling them to that ordinance; as we find <HI>John</HI> Bapti&s;t did. <HI>Matt.</HI> iii.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What multitudes did <HI>John</HI> Baptize? <HI>All Judea and Jeru|&s;alem, &amp;c. went out to him,</HI> except the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> &s;ays the text; and yet how few true converts among them! <HI>They re|joiced in his light but for a &s;ea&s;on.

And <HI>the di&s;ciples</HI> who <HI>baptized more than</HI> John, (<HI>John</HI> iv. 1.) no doubt went upon the &s;ame plan. See this point further cleated by Dr. <HI>Inc.

<P>Dr. <HI>C.

<P>Before I leave this head, I cannot help expre&s;&s;ing my &s;ur|pri&s;e to hear the names of &s;everal Mini&s;ters mentioned as patroni&s;ing the contrary &s;cheme, when it is notoriou&s;ly known that the &s;entiments of <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of them were as large as ours with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject of bapti&s;m; and I rather think it was &s;o as to <HI>all</HI> of them, except Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> who was too apt to run into extremes. Though I acknowledge, that none of them agree with Mr. <HI>Stoddard's</HI> notion of the &s;acraments being <HI>converting ordinances;</HI> neither did the <HI>Syned,</HI> that intro|duced this practice into our churches. This, by the way, leads me to ob&s;erve, that there are too controver&s;ies blended in this di&s;pute, which &s;hould be carefully &s;eparated, though there is no occa&s;ion for me to do it at pre&s;ent, as both parties agree in this, that bapti&s;m is of larger extent than the LORD'S &s;upper.</P>
<P>Here for further clearing this point, we may ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1 &s;t. That though bapti&s;m be a &s;eal of the covenant of grace; yet, as grace re&s;pects &s;inners, the virtue and efficacy of it is not confined to regenerate per&s;ons only. The &s;acraments are &s;eals of the whole covenant; bapti&s;m particularly is a &s;eal in the&s;e re&s;pects. 1 &s;t. It is a &s;eal of member&s;hip, a badge of di&s;ciple&s;hip, to di&s;tingui&s;h GOD'S profe&s;&s;ing people from the world. 2d. It is a &s;eal of the <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>reality</HI> of the co|venant; it exhibits to &s;inners the <HI>certainty</HI> of a way of mercy.

<PB N="17" REF="012367_0021_0F8925474E44FC10">efficacy of it unto &s;alvation: How encouraging then is this, to draw forth an act of faith?

"And if a man be but convinced of the&s;e things" &s;ays Mr. <HI>Stoddard,</HI> he is gained." <Q>The &s;acraments, &s;ays another, are not properly &s;eals of <HI>the truth of our faith,</HI> but of the truth of the convenant; they are only &s;eals of our faith by con&s;equence, becau&s;e as &s;eals confirm a thing, &s;o faith is confirmed and &s;trengthened by receiving; but they are not, in a proper &s;en&s;e, &s;eals unto any thing but the covenant. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leigh.</HI></NOTE></Q> 3d.

In regard of the&s;e latter, it was a &s;eal only in part; that is, of the other things I ju&s;t mentioned, which mu&s;t be acknowledged to be a great benefit.

2d. Though bapti&s;m and the LORD'S &s;upper be &s;eals of the &s;ame covenant, yet there is to impropriety of admini&s;tring the one &s;ometime before the other. And this in two ca&s;es e&s;pecial|ly;

<P>But if I &s;hould grent for arguments &s;ake that a le&s;&s;er de|gree of evidence will do, how high mu&s;t it ri&s;e?

<P N="4">4th.

<P N="5">5th.

<P N="6">6th. Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bapti&s;m be called a <HI>&s;eal</HI> or what you will, what rea&s;on can they a&s;&s;ign why grace is more nece&s;&s;ary in order to a per&s;ons bringing his children to it, than in order to praying, coming to meeting, <HI>&amp;c? Prayer</HI> is a <HI>&s;eal</HI> in &s;ome re&s;pects, and &s;o is <HI>bearing;</HI> and all the <HI>&s;acrifices</HI> under the law were <HI>&s;eals</HI> of the covenant of grace, as well as the <HI>pa&s;&s;over.</HI> (So Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> expre&s;&s;ly a&s;&s;erts, and it may be ea&s;ily proved) And yet who ever dreamed of excluding all unregenerate per&s;ons from them? The &s;in lay not in performing the duty, but in performing it in a <HI>wrong man|ner,</HI> which is the utmo&s;t that can be &s;aid with re&s;pect to bap|ti&s;m.</P>
<P N="7">7th. GOD him&s;elf hath <HI>divided the &s;eals,</HI> as in the ca&s;e of in|fants: And &s;hall we make our&s;elves wi&s;er than GOD, in &s;aying the &s;eals &s;hall not be divided? And he al&s;o in &s;ome ca&s;es di|vided circumci&s;ion and the pa&s;&s;over.

<P>The ca&s;e of <HI>infants</HI> plainly &s;hews it to be the divine plea&s;ure, that &s;ome <HI>unregenerates</HI> &s;hould be baptized; for he requires it to be done if they are under the covenant, and yet it is his plea&s;ure at the &s;ame time not to give them, that is, mo&s;t of them, the grace of the covenant, though there be no re&s;i&s;tance or op|po&s;ition on their parts. And it is the divine plea&s;ure likewi&s;e that the church &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tituted, that of nece&s;&s;ity we are obliged to receive many adult <HI>unregenerates</HI> into it, let us be ever &s;o careful and cautious. This thought pur&s;ued in its full latitude, and the genuine con&s;eqences from it duely con|&s;idered, methinks might <HI>ca&s;e the &s;cruples</HI> of any, about admi|ni&s;tring the ordinance to &s;uch as give but &s;tander evidences of grace: A prevailing fear of their unregeneracy &s;hould not pre|vens

This leads me to &s;ay.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, and upon the whole here, I apprehend none of the church would be unea&s;y if per&s;ons of &s;ome regular lives and behaviour could be admitted to bring their children, though &s;uch as are of a contrary character be excluded. Here pru|dence &s;hould direct, and caution &s;hould be u&s;ed not to pro&s;titute the ordinances to unmeet &s;ubjects. That <HI>profane per&s;ons</HI> are out of the que&s;tion is granted by all. And if &s;uch &s;hould be &s;hut out, it would remove the <HI>repreach</HI> of our having fallen from the method propo&s;ed by the <HI>Synod,</HI> who fir&s;t brought in this practice into the&s;e churches. Which if true, is more owing to the <HI>carele&s;ne&s;s</HI> of Mini&s;ters, than to <HI>an alteration</HI> of princi|ples.</P>
<P N="10">X.

When a Mini&s;ter hath peremptorily declared, that no unregenerate per&s;on ought to come to either &s;acrament, and hath charged them upon their peril not to come, and yet ear|ne&s;tly to urge particular candidates for bapti&s;m immediately to come to the LORD'S &s;upper is as much as to tell them that <HI>he is fully &s;atisfied they have grace,</HI> though he doth not &s;ay &s;o in words. And what is the tendency of this but to make them ea&s;y in their pre&s;ent condition without further examination? The corrupt hearts of many will flatter them la&s;t enough with <HI>hopes,</HI> and having the <HI>Mini&s;ter's &s;anction</HI> to back them, they will be in the utmo&s;t danger of being &s;taked down in delu|&s;ion.</P>
<P N="11">XI.

The que&s;tion was &s;tarted in the country &s;oon after <HI>grand-children</HI> were born to the fir&s;t comers, and the point agitated for twenty or thirty years by the able&s;t Divines, until at la&s;t the <HI>Synod</HI> of all the Mini&s;ters and churches, came to a &s;olemn deci&s;ion about it in the year 1662, after much prayer, &s;tudy, and conver&s;e, and
<PB N="21" REF="012367_0025_0F89254BD4B763F8">gave &s;uch weighty rea&s;ons for it as were never yet an&s;wered.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;uppo&s;e one main rea&s;on why <HI>Plymouth</HI> church did not join the <HI>Synod</HI> was, becau&s;e they were without a Mini&s;ter ten years together about that time; but the <HI>Synod</HI>'s principles were certainly agreeable to &s;ome of the church as appears by the pious Secretary <HI>Morton</HI>'s mentioning Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI>'s dying &s;peech with approbation in the <HI>New-England</HI> Me|morial, wherein Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> lament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it as <HI>one cau&s;e of</HI> GOD'S <HI>controver&s;y with the land that the baptizing of the children of the church was &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eglected.</HI> And this was my Grand|father <HI>Cotton</HI>'s principle, as I noted in my &s;o.mer E&s;&s;ay. Perhaps the rea&s;on why they did not practi&s;e upon it was, becau&s;e none of this &s;ort applied to have their children baptized. I find no motion toward it in the church-records.</NOTE> Neither did many of their po&s;terity receive it thus lightly: Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI> in particular had occa&s;ion and thoroughly &s;tudied the controver&s;y, as appeared by &s;everal &s;ermons on the point; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of many others. And I am &s;orry there is &s;uch occa&s;ion to retort the argument; I am per&s;uaded it is owing to the <HI>&s;uperficial</HI> remarks of &s;ome of our <HI>younger Divines,</HI> lately appearing in print, that this practice has been que&s;tioned, when as they had never thoroughly &s;tudied the <HI>grounds</HI> and <HI>rea|&s;ons</HI> our <HI>Fathers</HI> went upon, or even the point of <HI>infant bap|ti&s;m,</HI> which gives great light to the controver&s;y, and is really the <HI>foundation</HI> it is built upon, &s;o that they mu&s;t both &s;tand or fall together.</P>
<P N="12">XII and la&s;tly. The expedient to reconcile us, <HI>viz.

For.</P>
<P N="1">I&s;t. This &s;cheme goes upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, that <HI>by renewing covenant they are made members,</HI> which is wrong as I have prov|ed before. All <HI>baptized</HI> per&s;ons are members, whether they renew covenant or no, and are under obligations to all chri&s;|tian duties. This renewing covenant is never thought to make per&s;ons members in other ca&s;es: When a church is embodied in a new pari&s;h they enter into covenant anew, but are no more members than before; and ju&s;t &s;o it is when churches renew covenant in order to promote a reformation.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The term of <HI>members in full communion</HI> has been always appropriated to per&s;ons who <HI>immediately</HI> communicate, to di&s;|tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e who do not communicate, though in

And what difficulty would it cau&s;e about a form of di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion and recommendation, in ca&s;e any of the&s;e new &s;ort of mem|bers &s;hould remove to other towns before they communicated?

Even tho&s;e that are <HI>now</HI> communicants may think them&s;elves warranted by &s;uch liberty given to ab&s;ent them&s;elves when they plea&s;e: And how know we but by and by the effect of it may be that we &s;hould have no communicants at all? And what a ca&s;e would this be? A church without communicants? Many in full communion, and yet no communion? Members profe&s;&s;ing to &s;erve the LORD in all his ordinances, and yet no ordinan|ces? What an ab&s;urdity to open &s;uch a door as this?</P>
<P N="7">7th. In this new &s;cheme all the &s;ame difficulties recur, which are objected to the pre&s;ent method. This is a <HI>half-way</HI> practice as well as the other: This <HI>divides</HI> the &s;eals as well as the other, which has been declared "unwarrantable and unlawful:" This equally encourages unregenerate per&s;ons to come: This has a like tendency to keep per&s;ons along in their <HI>mi&s;takes,</HI> in their doubts and &s;cruples as the other mode. This as fully tolerates per&s;ons in living in the <HI>neglect</HI> of "one <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> duty of the covenant," as it is called, as the method propo&s;ed by the <HI>Synod.</HI> In a word, I know of nothing that may be objected again&s;t the pre&s;ent practice but what with equal force militates again&s;t the <HI>way</HI> propo&s;ed. It is called indeed by a <HI>new name,</HI> but that does not alter the nature of the thing; the &s;tyling them members in full communion does not make them one jot the more &s;o, than if they owned the covenant in the common form.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="24" REF="012367_0028_0F89254ED5D49F80">
8th. There &s;eems to be a downright incon&s;i&s;tency in this way of covenanting. They <HI>doubt</HI> whether they <HI>ought</HI> to come to the LORD'S table in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and yet they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> promi&s;e to come: They are to promi&s;e it, and then the church will di&s;pen&s;e with the performance; or in other words, will allow them to <HI>break their promi&s;e for a while,</HI> or perhaps as long as they live if the <HI>&s;ame rea&s;on</HI> continues, that is, if they do not get over their <HI>doubts</HI> before. How jarring and incoherant does this appear upon the bare mentioning: For my part, I think they had better not <HI>immediately promi&s;e,</HI> than not to <HI>per|form.</HI> The&s;e promi&s;es <HI>in futuro</HI> are looked upon in other ca&s;es as meet eva&s;ions to avoid a pre&s;ent duty; like a &s;inner's pro|mi&s;ing to repent hereafter, which he has no thoughts of at pre|&s;ent. And then further, as they promi&s;e it to GOD as well as to the church, they mu&s;t have GOD'S <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> as well as the church's, or they are obliged to come <HI>immediately,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding any thing the church can do. <HI>When thou ha&s;t vowed a vew unto</HI> GOD defer <HI>not to pay it. Eccl.</HI> v. 12.</P>
<P N="9">9th. The introducing this new &s;cheme will either cau&s;e the wholly laying by <HI>a relation of experiences,</HI> or this new fort of members mu&s;t &s;ubmit to this practice, or we mu&s;t have two different methods of admitting per&s;ons to full commu|nion: And great inconveniences would ari&s;e by either of the&s;e different ways. With re&s;pect to <HI>relations</HI> I have &s;poken before. I would only add, that if the&s;e non-communicants in full communion &s;hould be obliged to bring a relation, I believe it would as effectually put a &s;top to their coming, as any of the mo&s;t rigid methods the church could po&s;&s;ibly take: I dare &s;ay we &s;hould have no members of the&s;e &s;ort: They would carry their children to other churches that are not &s;o &s;trait.</P>
<P N="10">10th. The mo&s;t material difference between this and the pre&s;ent method &s;eems to be this, that in the one ca&s;e the convenant is propo&s;ed <HI>twice,</HI> and in the other ca&s;e but <HI>once:</HI> Which, it is &s;trange to me, &s;hould occa&s;ion any <HI>Jeru|ples of con&s;cience,</HI> &s;ince it only adds to the <HI>&s;olemnity</HI> of the af|fair, and does but little, if at all, dimini&s;h their obligations of coming to the LORD'S table; in the one method they pro|mi&s;ing diligently to &s;eek <HI>preparations</HI> for it, and in the other, that they will come when they have got over their &s;cruples, and are better &s;atisfied that they are prepared for the ordi|nance; which certainly is the &s;ame thing in effect: And there is as much danger on the one &s;ide as the other, of their u&s;ing it
<PB N="25" REF="012367_0029_0F89254FBA16AE88">meerly as a <HI>formality,</HI> e&s;pecially after a while, to get their children baptized.</P>
<P>As for the &s;ugge&s;tion, that by this <HI>two-fold repetition</HI> of the co|venant, per&s;ons are led into the mi&s;taken notion, that there are <HI>two different covenants,</HI> and that the fir&s;t is of a <HI>laxer</HI> nature than the la&s;t: it is impo&s;&s;ible for a per&s;on that hears both <HI>forms</HI> read rationally to entertain &s;uch a thought; but if any of the weak|er &s;ort are in danger of it, they may be ea&s;ily &s;et right from the pulpit, or by conver&s;ation. As for their being made <HI>twice member;</HI> by it, enough has been &s;aid before, when it was ob|&s;erved that this renewing covenant does not make them mem|bers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11th. If the difficulty lies here, <HI>the propo&s;ing of the covenant twice,</HI> as being thought &s;uperfluous and unnece&s;&s;ary, for peace &s;ake I &s;hould not object again&s;t the fir&s;t propo&s;ing of it being wholly laid a&s;ide; I mean with re&s;pect to tho&s;e already in the covenant or per&s;ons baptized; and that they, after being propounded a competent time and no objection made to their lives and morals, &s;hould be allowed to bring their children to bapti&s;m. Though after all I &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee the church abate any thing from the &s;olemnity of the affair, which cer|tainly is of good tendency both in regard of the candidate and &s;pectators, and intitles the former to the prayer of the church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, I &s;hould be glad of any proper expedient to remove the difficulties among us, and to pre&s;erve peace and harmony; but as for the expedient under con&s;ideration, I can|not &s;ee my way clear to come into it at pre&s;ent. And if the majority of the church &s;hould approve of it, I am afraid that we &s;hould become <HI>an object of ridicule</HI> to the whole country for our <HI>&s;ingularity,</HI> and for our introducing &s;uch an incon&s;i&s;tent jumbled &s;cheme, which was never heard of in the churches before this day; and even now I do not find it &s;o much as hint|ed, that above one church practi&s;es any thing like it.</P>

<HEAD>THE THIRD ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P>SOME THINGS have occurred to my mind &s;ince the la&s;t church-meeting, relating to the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall take notice of &s;ome po&s;itions that have been ad|vanced, and objections made.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It is objected, that many make a <HI>formality</HI> of the prac|tice meerly to get their children baptized. An&s;wer. I &s;ear it is too true. But how &s;hall this new regulation remedy the difficulty? If this door were entirely &s;hut, is there not as much danger of making a <HI>formality</HI> of the LORD'S &s;uppot ra|ther than their children &s;hould go without bapti&s;m. But as to &s;ome there is no doubt they do it not <HI>formally,</HI> but <HI>&s;incerely:</HI> And &s;hall we keep them away, becau&s;e others abu&s;e the pri|vilege? For my part, I am of my Great-grandfather <HI>Cotton</HI>'s mind, that <HI>it is better to admit ten bypocrites, than to excluae one &s;incere child of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>And I would add, if they are &s;uch per&s;ons who make a formality of it that chiefly come to renew convenant for their children's &s;ake, how comes it to pa&s;s that the door is op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed for their admi&s;&s;ion to the LORD'S &s;upper? For i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hath been once and again &s;aid, that the purport of the new &s;cheme is to <HI>enlarge and not to curtail and dimini&s;h their privileges,</HI> viz. by obliging them to come immediately into full communion.</P>
<P N="2">2d. It is objected, Mr. <HI>Leonard's</HI> great difficulty in bring|ing in the practice, and that he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;even years about it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an&s;wer, Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI> was indeed &s;o long about it; but the rea&s;on was not becau&s;e he could not gain a major vote before; for he had the major part of the church with him, (I think) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t fir&s;t, at lea&s;t for years before the point was brought to a publick deci&s;ion. But this aro&s;e, 1&s;t. From his <HI>prudence</HI> becau&s;e he would not grieve two or three re&s;pectable member<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but would wait until he had gained their acquie&s;cence at lea&s;t. 2d. In this he acted according to the ancient practice and con&s;titution of this church. For in the records we find they would not vote in affairs of importance, e&s;pecially in alterations of any part of wor&s;hip, untill they had gained the con&s;ent of every brother, at lea&s;t &s;o far as to acquie&s;ce in the church procced<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e were the real cau&s;es of his delay in putting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to vote.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="012367_0031_0F892551CE70B378">
And if any thing may be argued from Mr. <HI>Leonard's</HI> being &s;even years about it, it is this, that we ought to be as long at lea&s;t in con&s;idering before we ca&s;t this practice out, proceeding in the &s;ame gradual manner, and not to do any thing of &s;uch importance ra&s;hly and in ha&s;te.</P>
<P N="3">3d. It is &s;aid our Fathers of this church admitted not the practice. I an&s;wer, they admitted that upon which this prac|tice is grounded, that is, they admitted all the children of the church to <HI>renew covenant</HI> in a body, and that more than once, without coming to the LORD'S table. Which is further than our Pa&s;tor would have us go. And I appeal to him, after they had gone &s;o far, whether they ought not to have gone farther, and baptized their children, as he does now the children of them who have formerly owned the covenant.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Thacther</HI> of <HI>Middleborough</HI> after &s;uch general renewing of covenant in his church, baptized all their children without any further &s;tep; and perhaps our Fathers would have done the &s;ame, if any of the&s;e renewers of covenant had appli|ed to have their children baptized, which does not appear from the records that ever they did. Further, I find they had high|er thoughts of infant's member&s;hip than many now a days have; they looked upon them as members; they dealt with them as &s;uch; they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and recommended them to other chur|ches when they removed, and &s;ent admonitions after them, if not di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, when they mi&s;behaved.</P>
<P N="4">4th. It is &s;aid that none but vi&s;ible Chri&s;tians or Believers, &s;hould partake of &s;pecial privileges. I readily grant it, and &s;ay, that all baptized per&s;ons are vi&s;ible Chri&s;tians or Believers, unle&s;s they carry the Devil's mark, a <HI>profane life,</HI> or are <HI>known infidels.</HI> This and nothing el&s;e &s;hould exclude them from the privilege of bapti&s;m, if they a&s;k for it. If we can prove by &s;cripture marks to the &s;atisfaction of the church, that they are wicked per&s;ons, or if they make an open profe&s;&s;ion of unre|generacy, that is, know and acknowledge them&s;elves to be un|regenerate, we de&s;ire not their admi&s;&s;ion. It would be pre|po&s;terous indeed to apply CHRIST'S &s;eal to tho&s;e that are vi|&s;ibly the Devil's children, and own them&s;elves to be &s;uch with|out any compunctions of con&s;cience. But if we have only fears and &s;cruples about them and cannot &s;ay but that after all they may have <HI>&s;ome good thing in them toward the</HI> LORD, an <HI>Abijah</HI> had in the hou&s;e of <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> how dare we &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot them out or &s;ay they &s;hall not do their duty as far as they at pre&s;ent &s;ee light for it? Read <HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. 6.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="012367_0032_0F892552959FD7C8">
If &s;eems to me that the di&s;tinction between <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> and <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> believers is too much blended and confounded in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute. If it is <HI>vi&s;ible grace</HI> only that intitles in the &s;ight of the church, then all the talk about <HI>real grace</HI> is nothing to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5th. It is &s;aid, if vi&s;ible grace entitles to the &s;eals, why ought we to make a di&s;tinction, and admit &s;ome to one ordinance and others to both? I an&s;wer, 1&s;t. That it is the candidates them|&s;elves generally &s;peaking that make the di&s;tinction, and not the church; and we ought to admit them to the di&s;charge of their duty as far as they &s;ee light to go, and not to lay &s;tumb|ling-blocks in their way. 2d. I am fully of Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI>'s mind, that bapti&s;m as well as the LORD'S &s;upper are &s;eals of the convenant of grace. But the con&s;equence he draws from it I deny, that bapti&s;m and the LORD'S &s;upper are of <HI>equal extent.</HI> It is and has been my &s;ettled principle and practice, to be more &s;trict in admi&s;&s;ions to the LORD'S table than to bap|ti&s;m. And I have the example of almo&s;t all churches from the beginning to patronize me in it. If there be but a <HI>hare po&s;&s;ibility</HI> that a per&s;on has grace, I think he ought not to be excluded from bapti&s;m for him&s;elf or children. But <HI>more po&s;itive evidences</HI> of grace were nece&s;&s;ary for the LORD'S &s;upper. And this for &s;everal rea&s;ons: The&s;e two among the re&s;t;
<LIST>

<ITEM>2d. Becau&s;e if afterwards they were back|&s;liders, it would bring le&s;s reproach on religion or the church than if they were admitted to full communion.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="6">6th. It is &s;aid that the per&s;ons in que&s;tion have only an <HI>in|fant-member&s;hip</HI> which differs from that of the adult. I an&s;wer, it differs not in the <HI>e&s;&s;entials</HI> of it. All member&s;hip comes by <HI>divine in&s;titution;</HI> and is as <HI>real</HI> member&s;hip, and as <HI>compleat</HI> in the one as in the other, that is, in the children as in the pa|rents. <HI>Paul</HI> was as real and compleat a <HI>Roman</HI> citizen as the <HI>Chief Captain,</HI> though the one came to it by <HI>birth</HI> and the other by <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> at adult age. Original &s;in comes in a different manner from other &s;ins, <HI>viz.</HI> by the mediation of our parents, yet it is as really a &s;in <HI>in us</HI> as any that we actually commit. The like may be &s;aid in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. But after all, if it be a reproach to have only an infant-member&s;hip, we may ea&s;ily take it away by this church's renewing covenant, as our ance&s;tors d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and calling upon the children of the church to join with us in it in a body. And then &s;urely none will deny them to be adult members.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="29" REF="012367_0033_0F89255481D665E0">
II. I &s;hall now make &s;ome OBSERVATIONS for the further clearing the point, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. I think this is a point of the greate&s;t importance that ever came before this church. The que&s;tion is, whether our children &s;hall be treated as outca&s;ts, as &s;trangers to the cove|nants of promi&s;e, or in orher words, as Infidels, as Pagans, without GOD in the world and without hope! If the act e&s;ta|bli&s;hing this practice &s;hould be repealed, I &s;hould look upon it that all our children are this day unchurched and excom|municated, and that the church hath nothing more to do with them in a way of di&s;cipline. The brethren had need con|&s;ider what they do before they act: Your children are no doubt dear to you; and will you, blindfold, this day ca&s;t them out of the heritage of the LORD? Will you with your own hands, lifted up to Heaven, <HI>deliver them to Satan?</HI> I cannot po&s;&s;ibly put any other con&s;truction on the matter: They mu&s;t either be within the church or without; either <HI>dogs,</HI> or <HI>lambs of</HI> CHRIST'S <HI>flock:</HI> If they are <HI>within,</HI> that is, members, they are certaily entitled to &s;ome privilege; and what privilege have they left, if their children mu&s;t not be baptized? Did we not learn this in our earlie&s;t infancy, <HI>that the enfants of &s;uch as are members of the vi&s;ible church are to be baptized?</HI> But if they mu&s;t be di&s;covenanted and ca&s;t out after all, I cannot help turning myfelf to them, as many &s;uch are pre&s;ent, and &s;aying to &s;uch as are of <HI>good conver&s;ation,</HI> as in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> lxvi. 5. <HI>Your brethren that ca&s;t you out, for my name's &s;ake, &s;aid, let the</HI> LORD <HI>be glorified: but he &s;hall appear to your joy, and they &s;hall be a&s;hamed.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;on of this <HI>apo&s;trophe</HI> was, I had been informed of two or three that had applied to own the covenant, but were de|nied, though at the &s;ame time urged to come to full commu|nion.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2d. But why are we to do this? The plea or pretence is <HI>grace.</HI> But I dare &s;ay it will be found a mo&s;t <HI>ungracious</HI> &s;cheme in the i&s;&s;ue: It will bring in a carnal generation into the church, I mean into the number of communicants: other doors being &s;hut they will after a while ru&s;h into it as the hor&s;e to the battle, rather than not have their children bap|tized. And Mini&s;ters and churches will be more <HI>lax</HI> in ad|mi&s;&s;ions, rather than to have a generation of <HI>heathens</HI> growing up among them. This it &s;eems begins already to be the ca&s;e, where this alteration takes place, as &s;ome &s;erious people complain.</P>
<P N="3">3d. I would query, whether it is probable <HI>Abraham</HI> had grounds to think that <HI>all</HI> his numerous family were converted,
<PB N="30" REF="012367_0034_0F892554CEDCF650">when they entered into &s;olemn covenant? <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. and whe|ther he would have been ju&s;tified if upon his fearing the contra|ry, he had withheld the &s;eal from them? <HI>Abraham's</HI> family was the only church in the world, and a type of the go&s;pel church; and what was done in it, ought to be done in go&s;pel times. We &s;hould not be &s;tricter than <HI>Abraham</HI> the <HI>father of the faith|ful,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;ince we are in the <HI>&s;ame covenant</HI> with him. <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. and xi. and <HI>Gel.</HI> iii.</P>
<P N="4">4th. If this new &s;cheme takes place, the next &s;tep may be a total laying a&s;ide of <HI>relations.</HI> This it &s;eems is done in <HI>Con|necticut,</HI> by the mo&s;t zealous promoters of this new method. And Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> owns, that it is matter of indifferency, or at lea&s;t, that a church may be rightly con&s;tituted without them: If &s;o, they may be laid a&s;ide. And what will be the con&s;e|quence of this? Why, 1&s;t. the knowledge of <HI>experiences</HI> will be left to the &s;ole cognizance of Mini&s;ters: And mu&s;t the church tru&s;t implicitly to them? 2d. The church will have nothing left to judge by, but external evidences. And then, as to many, they will have only <HI>negative</HI> evidences: And as to the can|didates mo&s;t known, <HI>blamele&s;ne&s;s</HI> of life will be the &s;um total of the evidence. Every one that can &s;ay with the <HI>Phari&s;ee, I am no extertioner, unju&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. or with the young man, <HI>all the&s;e have I kept,</HI> &amp;c. mu&s;t be admitted to the LORD'S &s;upper. What then will become of the &s;cheme of <HI>real grace</HI> being e&s;&s;en|tial? Or how will they free them&s;elves from incon&s;i&s;tency, as I noted before?</P>
<P N="5">5th. I would ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Synod</HI> were of the &s;ame mind with Mr. <HI>Robbins,</HI> that it is <HI>real grace</HI> that entitles a per&s;on to the ordinances in the &s;ight of GOD, and that it is <HI>vi&s;ible grace</HI> that entitles them in the &s;ight of the church; and yet they ad|mini&s;tred bapti&s;m in this latitude: They could &s;ee no incon|&s;i&s;tency between the&s;e things; and how came we at this day to be more clear-&s;ighted?</P>
<P N="6">6th. Further, with re&s;pect to the <HI>Synod</HI> that introduced this practice <HI>generally,</HI> (for it was introduced by &s;ome particular Mini&s;ters and churches before) I would ob&s;erve two things.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. The famous Mini&s;ters that came into the country at the fir&s;t &s;ettlement were mo&s;t of them alive and pre&s;ent at the <HI>Synod.</HI> and mo&s;tly joined in it. And tho&s;e that were dead, as my Great-grandfather Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sheppard,</HI> and others, were for it, as appears by their writings. And as for tho&s;e Mini|&s;ters that oppo&s;ed the <HI>Synod,</HI> they afterwards almo&s;t to a man &s;ell in with it, in&s;omuch that Mr. <HI>Mitchell</HI> in his letter to D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.
<PB N="31" REF="012367_0035_0F89255606131978"><HI>Inc. Mather,</HI> five years after the <HI>Synod,</HI> tells him that he was <HI>le&s;t almo&s;t alone:</HI> And he afterwards fell in; from what motives his writings tell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. I think it an ob&s;ervation of &s;ome weight, that the <HI>temptation</HI> that lay before our Fathers was rather to be too <HI>rigid</HI> than <HI>lax</HI> in admi&s;&s;ions.</ITEM>
</LIST>
For they were ju&s;tly and greatly offended with the church of <HI>England,</HI> from which they had ju&s;t broke away, for their admitting every one, yea the profane&s;t to go&s;pel ordinances, as members of the national church. This is one of the rea&s;ons they always give of their &s;eperation, <HI>viz. promi&s;cuous admini&s;trations:</HI> And yet they &s;o far got over their prejudices as to come into &s;uch a re&s;ult as we have in the <HI>Synod-Book.</HI> And as to Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> in particu|lar, the grand oppo&s;er of the <HI>Synod,</HI> we find in his life, that he was not only prejudiced by the loo&s;e admini&s;trations in the church of <HI>England,</HI> but by what he &s;aw in <HI>Holland,</HI> when he was Mini&s;ter there; they requiring his baptizing <HI>all children</HI> belonging to his a&s;&s;embly, let their parents or guardians be eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o <HI>ignorant</HI> or <HI>&s;candalous,</HI> which he refu&s;ing, was forced to leave his mini&s;try among them. And he was afraid if he joined with the <HI>Synod</HI> it would come to this at length in <HI>New-England.</HI> As to Pre&s;ident <HI>Chauncy</HI> the other great oppo&s;er of the <HI>Synod,</HI> (for|merly Mini&s;ter of this church) we know how <HI>rigid</HI> he was about the <HI>dipping</HI> of infants; he would neither baptize them in the common way him&s;elf, nor &s;uffer it to be done by other Mini|&s;ters, which occa&s;ioned his leaving this place. No wonder then that he was as <HI>rigid</HI> in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. The&s;e two with Dr. <HI>Inc. Mather,</HI> were the chief oppo&s;ers and writers again&s;t the <HI>Synod;</HI> but Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> altered his mind, as you have heard.</P>
<P N="7">7th. I think it a good ob&s;ervation of the worthy and inge|nious Mr. <HI>Neal,</HI> who was formerly in <HI>New-England,</HI> (but now or lately a Mini&s;ter in <HI>London</HI>) in his <HI>New-England</HI> Hi&s;tory, &s;peaking of the <HI>Synod</HI> in 1662 he &s;ays, <Q>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, for my own part, that it looks but like an odd a&s;&s;ertion to me to call a per&s;on <HI>a member of a church,</HI> who hath no right to any of its <HI>privileges,</HI> and yet remains expo&s;ed to its <HI>cen&s;ures.</HI></Q> A &s;trange &s;ort of member&s;hip indeed!</P>
<P N="8">8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h. If the church mu&s;t be purged in this &s;ort, that is, &s;o con&s;iderable a number of members mu&s;t be declared uncapable of any privilege, and in effect di&s;covenanted, I would move that the church would begin higher in this purging work. Let us begin with the communicants; let all be examined; let them be a&s;ked one by one <HI>whether they have grace,</HI> or <HI>whether they love the</HI> LORD JESUS <HI>in &s;incerity?</HI> And if they have not
<PB N="32" REF="012367_0036_0F89255793B94160">a&s;&s;urance of this, or good evidence, let them be rendered un|capable of any privilege or di&s;covenanted until it is other|wi&s;e with them. In a word, let us turn down-right <HI>Separates,</HI> and &s;et up a pure church, this would be acting con&s;i&s;tently, and not turning our artillery again&s;t the weaker part of the members only.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, As to the manner the church &s;hould act in this affair. I would a&s;k the members, as it were one by one, whether they can &s;ay upon their con&s;ciences and according to the word of GOD, that the practice is wrong and erroneous, or in other words, that it &s;prung from Hell? If the major part can &s;ay this without any doubt or he&s;itation upon their minds, I would a&s;k further, what right the &s;cripture gives them to impo&s;e their &s;entiments upon their fellow-members, who think the practice agreeable to the will of GOD? Ought there not rather to be &s;ome way found out in which our con&s;ciences may remain in|violate, and none of our chri&s;tian rights invaded, and we con|tinued in communion together in charity and love? And is not the method I propo&s;ed at the la&s;t church-meeting of this nature?</P>
<P>Whether the major part of the church be for or again&s;t the practice I know not, having conver&s;ed with but few. But if any alteration takes place, I apprehend two things nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That tho&s;e who vote for the alteration &s;hould have clear evidence, if not a&s;&s;urance of their own regenerate e&s;tate. The new plan &s;uppo&s;es it nece&s;&s;ary that all candidates for bapti&s;m or the LORD'S &s;upper have &s;uch evidence. And &s;hall candidates be excluded by tho&s;e who have it not them&s;elves? As our Saviour &s;aid, <HI>He that is without &s;in let him ca&s;t the fir&s;t &s;tone;</HI> &s;o I &s;ay, let him that hath good evidence of his own gracious &s;tate <HI>ca&s;t a &s;tone</HI> at our baptized members; and let none el&s;e pre&s;ume to do it by voting in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e. If they do they condemn them&s;elves; they pull the <HI>mote</HI> out of their brother's eye, and leave the <HI>beam</HI> in their own, contrary to our Saviour's command; they require that of others, which their con&s;ciences tell them they are de&s;titute of them&s;elves. And what an ab&s;urdity is this? What a pre&s;umption? What a &s;elf-condemning mark? It was to &s;uch ca&s;es as this the Apo&s;tle had reference in <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 1. <HI>Therefore thou art inexcu&s;able, O man, who&s;oever thou art that judge&s;t; for wherein thou judge&s;t another thou condemne&s;t thy&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2d. The other thing nece&s;&s;ary is, that the church &s;hould be unanimous in the alteration, at lea&s;t that all oppo&s;ition &s;hould cea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="012367_0037_0F89255888E7FFB0">
Our church records inform us, <Q>That before any vote was called in affairs of importance, care was always taken to gain the con&s;ent of every Brother: And in ca&s;e any could not actually vote; yet expre&s;&s;ing, that they could re&s;t in the act of the church, it was &s;atisfying: And this was a great pre|&s;ervation of the peace of the church.</Q> This is the con&s;titu|tion of the church. How then can this practice be aboli&s;hed, when about half the church at lea&s;t, are zealous for it? This would be an impo&s;ition with a witne&s;s; &s;uch as was never heard of, &s;ince the church had a foundation.</P>
<P>But how is it po&s;&s;ible then, that this affair &s;hould ever be &s;ettled? I an&s;wer, it can be &s;ettled no other way, than by mu|tual toleration and forbearance. The church may, if they think proper, pa&s;&s;ively acquie&s;ce in Mr. <HI>Robins's forbearing the practice,</HI> until he hath more light to act in the affair. This is the utmo&s;t that they can do, without a general concurrence and con&s;ent, or while our different &s;entiments remain.</P>
<P>And if the church thus far conde&s;cend to Mr. <HI>Robbins,</HI> I think at lea&s;t he ought as far to conde&s;cend to tho&s;e of differ|ent apprehen&s;ions; that is, by pa&s;&s;ively acquie&s;ing at bapti&s;m being admini&s;tred among us by other Mini&s;ters, as has been al|ready propo&s;ed, and not to imitate Mr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> in his rigid|ne&s;s, or lay &s;tumbling blocks in the way to prevent or di&s;cou|rage Mini&s;ters coming. Thus by mutual forbearance, the af|fair may be peaceably accommodated, and no violation of con&s;cience on either &s;ide. But if the matter be drove on with violence, who can tell what the con&s;equence will be: GOD only knows.</P>
<P>And I would finally &s;ay, that if a vote of repeal be obtained, it would be <HI>null</HI> in it&s;elf, unle&s;s by a <HI>previous vote</HI> the con&s;titu|tion of the church be altered, and a new con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed, wherein the major part &s;hould have a right granted them of <HI>ruling the con&s;ciences of their Brethren;</HI> which GOD forbid &s;hould ever be the fate of this once famous, but now declining church. AMEN.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was called to go to <HI>Middleborough</HI> the day after our church meeting, and the Fa&s;t being the next day pre|vented

And on the whole, I am &s;till of the &s;ame mind I was, that what you read in your <HI>la&s;t Puce</HI> was a mo&s;t <HI>injurious, unchri&s;tian, ungentleman-like, gro&s;s mi&s;|repre&s;entation</HI> of the &s;entiments of your brethren who are on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion in debate. You, Sir, do <HI>cer|tainly</HI> know, that neither I not they hold to &s;uch things as you there advanced as being our &s;entiments; neither can any of your frightful con&s;equences be with the lea&s;t appear|ance of ju&s;tice or fairne&s;s, drawn from our principles. To what purpo&s;e then, were tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate exclamations and pathetic addre&s;&s;es to the people, both church and congrega|tion, but to prejudice their minds again&s;t us and our opini|ons, without any &s;criptural or rational grounds? Is this a <HI>fair</HI> or <HI>chri&s;tian treatment</HI> of your Pa&s;tor and Brethren? Can you think either to carry your point by &s;uch methods as the&s;e; or if you could, that it would be upright and agreea|ble to the mind of CHRIST? You, Sir, have more &s;en&s;e, I am per&s;uaded, than to imagine men of tolerable penetration can look upon &s;uch <HI>popular</HI> harangues and <HI>appeals to men's pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> as &s;ound rea&s;oning, or fair &s;criptural argumenta|tion. However I find that notwith&s;tanding its <HI>&s;eeming</HI> affec|tionatene&s;s and popularity, it has been far from accom|pli&s;hing the end for which you mu&s;t have evidently de&s;ign|ed it. For I have heard numbers &s;peak of it &s;ince, and tho&s;e of your &s;ide the que&s;tion too, who are by no means plea&s;|ed with it, nor with the manner in which it was delivered, but &s;pake of it with great di&s;like: And I rather think your cau&s;e, which I am per&s;uaded is not the cau&s;e of GOD, will &s;uffer by it. I think, Sir, you have rea&s;on, as a Chri&s;tian, al&s;o to reflect, whether your being &s;o free in dealing out im|plicitly the cur&s;es of GOD'S Book upon tho&s;e of us who think differently from you was quite agreeable to that meek and lowly &s;pirit, which becomes the followers of the LAME of GOD. It appears to me, when you come <HI>calmly</HI> to reflect upon it, it mu&s;t excite penitential &s;hame, and be matter of deep humiliation before GOD. It no doubt flowed from the heat of your zeal to &s;upport your cau&s;e, and to prepo&s;|&s;e&s;s the minds of the multitude in favour of it; but I think it very ill became a profe&s;&s;or of godl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> you
<PB N="35" REF="012367_0039_0F89255ACA1DA920">could not be &s;o incon&s;iderate as to imagine to <HI>affrighten</HI> your opponents by &s;uch a <HI>mi&s;application</HI> of &s;cripture. However, I think, Sir, it is truly an awful thing when GOD'S word is <HI>wre&s;ted</HI> to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of <HI>any</HI> party <HI>meerly:</HI> More aw|ful &s;till when men attempt to turn GOD'S artillery again&s;t his own cau&s;e and intere&s;t as I think, has been too much the ca&s;e here, though not de&s;ignedly. I mean not, as was hinted above, to attempt to terrify or affrighten you hereby, but only pray that it may excite in you reflection and &s;erious thought. It is no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to me, Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> to find, that <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of tho&s;e Chri&s;tians among us, <HI>both men and women,</HI> who are ju&s;tly looked upon to live near to GOD, and to enjoy <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of the life, power, and &s;weetne&s;s of expe|rimental religion, are on our &s;ide of this que&s;tion. I much que&s;tion whether you have four women in the whole church with you, which I think is of &s;ome con&s;ideration in this af|fair, though they cannot vote. I am &s;en&s;ible, Sir, indeed, and believe you are aware too, that your's is the mo&s;t popular &s;ide of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The <HI>practice</HI> you attempt to &s;upport, and the <HI>argu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s</HI> made u&s;e of, do perfectly accord with the natural pride of the unregenerate heart, and their &s;elf-ju&s;tifying &s;pirit and di&s;po&s;ition. It reli&s;hes exceeding well with the genera|lity of men, to hear that <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> in infancy and negative evidences of grace are enough to ground a chri&s;tian cha|ritable belief that &s;uch per&s;ons are good folks, and may be admitted to <HI>covenant</HI> with GOD: Whence they will naturally conclude their &s;tate is &s;afe enough, in &s;pite of all the mi|ni&s;terial in&s;tructions and warnings that can be given them. It &s;uite gracele&s;s hearts &s;pecial well to be told that un|regenerate men may &s;afely &s;ay, they <HI>avouch the</HI> LORD <HI>for their</HI> GOD, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as you publickly a&s;&s;erted in your fir&s;t Piece.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Having omitted the argument in my fir&s;t Piece, in which the pa&s;&s;age here referred to, is included, becau&s;e it comes in more properly in my la&s;t Piece, I think it be&s;t to in&s;ert the pa&s;|&s;age here, le&s;t Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> &s;hould make a noi&s;e about it. It runs thus, <Q>Returning <HI>Ephraim</HI> u&s;es this plea with GOD, when he begs for converting grace, <HI>Turn thou me,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for thou art the</HI> LORD <HI>my</HI> GOD. <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxi. Not that he thought that he had a &s;pecial &s;aving intere&s;t in GOD at this time; (he was far from thinking &s;o) but what he means is, <HI>that</HI> GOD <HI>was his</HI> GOD <HI>by covenant relation:</HI> He was early dedicated to GOD by circumci&s;ion, and therefore he begs of GOD, that the ble&s;&s;ings of the cove|nant may be imparted to him. And, by the way, this may an&s;wer the argument that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> brought from tho&s;e words u&s;ed in our covenant at this day, <HI>you avouch the</HI> LORD JEHOVAH <HI>to be your</HI> GOD; a man may &s;afely &s;ay it, though he has preponderating &s;ears that he is not con|verted. If a &s;en&s;ibly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;inner may u&s;e this ex|pre&s;&s;ion in prayer to GOD, he may as well do it upon any other occa&s;ion, though he dare not &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y or think he has grace.</Q></NOTE> This is laying a broad foundation with a wit|ne&s;s
<PB N="36" REF="012367_0040_0F89255F7685AC10">for &s;inners to build their fal&s;e hopes upon. How|ever, this I mu&s;t tell you, Sir, that &s;o long as I have my &s;en&s;es, by divine help, I will oppo&s;e to the utmo&s;t of my power, &s;uch notions, both re&s;pecting doctrine and di&s;ci|pline, and that however &s;olemnly, pa&s;&s;ionately, or &s;eri|ou&s;ly they are advanced, or let the names or characters of their propagators be what they will. Neither can I in con&s;cience encourage the INSTRUCTIONS of tho&s;e who hold and advance &s;uch doctrines among a people, the charge of who&s;e immortal intere&s;ts is committed to me.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL not be led into a paper controver&s;y; neither my pre&s;ent hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, nor inclination will permit it. One an&s;wer for all. I read your long Epi&s;tle with a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;urprize, and all the while I was reading, my con&s;cience told me, <HI>that I was not the man.</HI></P>
<P>You repre&s;ent my di&s;cour&s;e at the church-meeting as a meer <HI>popular harangue</HI> and <HI>appeal to men's pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> as if this was the main &s;cope and &s;ub&s;tance of it. I have looked it over care&s;ully and find little of this nature contained in it. It con&s;i&s;ts of eleven pages, and about ten of tho&s;e eleven are taken up in rea&s;oning clo&s;ely, as I thought, on the point, or in relating matter of fact re&s;pecting the <HI>Synod,</HI> Mr. <HI>Da|venport,</HI> Mr. <HI>Leonard, &amp;c.</HI> or in declaring the con&s;titution of the church, and what was proper for the church to do in the matter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And I &s;carce know what you refer to, except it be what I &s;aid about our children's being excommunicated, and my quoting <HI>I&s;a.</HI> lxvi. 5. As to the latter, you may re|member that I addre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e baptized per&s;ons only who were of <HI>good conver&s;ation,</HI> not the profane; and herein I had re&s;pect particularly to Mr. <HI>Ichabed S&mdash;w,</HI> and one or two more, whom I had heard you would not admit to own the covenant, and yet were willing to receive to full communi|on. It was, I &s;uppo&s;e, my mentioning this text, that oc|ca&s;ions your a&s;&s;erting that I was free in dealing out implicitly the cur&s;es in GOD'S Book upon tho&s;e who thought different|ly from me, for I find nothing el&s;e that looks that way. Whether any cur&s;es were thus denounced, a brief paraphra&s;e of the text will di&s;cover: It runs thus, <HI>your Brethren that (hated you and;</HI> the&s;e words I left out becau&s;e in no &s;en&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="012367_0043_0F892563D7640980">applicable) <HI>ca&s;t you out;</HI> (this was really the ca&s;e in my ap|prehen&s;ion) <HI>&s;aid, let the</HI> LORD <HI>he glorified.</HI> This is the very thing you urge, that the new &s;cheme is for the glory of GOD. <HI>But he &s;hall appear to your joy.</HI> (That is, Providence will keep the door open for your admitance) <HI>and they &s;hall be a&s;hamed.</HI> That is, they &s;hall be <HI>convined</HI> of their error in being &s;o &s;trait, and <HI>conviction</HI> is always accompanied with <HI>&s;hame.</HI> This was my real intent and meaning in u&s;ing this text, and the &s;en&s;e, I believe, in which the hearers ge|nerally took it. But taking the text in a greater latitude, I do not &s;ee how it can be called a <HI>dealing out of</HI> GOD'S <HI>cur&s;es</HI> again&s;t you or your adherents. As to the propriety of my mentioning this text, (in the allu&s;ive &s;en&s;e in which it was meant and taken) I have not the lea&s;t doubt. But as to the <HI>prudence</HI> of it, that is another que&s;tion: It might perhaps be an <HI>imprudent</HI> &s;tep becau&s;e it tended rather to irritate than enlighten. As to my charging you with &s;entiments, which I know you di&s;|claim, I know not what you mean, except my &s;aying, <Q>The new plan &s;uppo&s;es it nece&s;&s;ary that all candidates for bapti&s;m or the LORD'S &s;upper have clear evidence, if not a&s;&s;urance of their regenerate e&s;tate.</Q> Whether you hold this or not, let your Sermons &s;peak; except one, &verbar;wherein you endeavoured to remove the &s;cruple ari&s;ing from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. 29. In which you brought down the terms &s;o <HI>low,</HI> that &s;carce any need be afraid of coming. How you can reconcile this to your other Di&s;cour&s;es, I know not.</P>
<P>If you further mean, that I charge you with a <HI>direct de&s;ign</HI> of excommunicating the children of the church: I charge you with no &s;uch thing; but that it is the direct con&s;equence of your opinion, I then and now, and I believe always &s;hall a&s;&s;ert. And I held up this con&s;equence before you, that you might &s;ee the ab&s;urdity of your opinion. What can be more natural than &s;uch rea&s;oning as this? <Q>If the act e&s;ta|bli&s;hing this practice &s;hould be repealed, I &s;hould look upon it that all our children are this day unchurched and excom|municated, and that the church hath nothing more to do with them in a way of di&s;cipline. I cannot po&s;&s;ibly put any other con&s;truction on the matter: They mu&s;t either be within the church or without; either <HI>dogs,</HI> or <HI>lambs</HI> of CHRIST'S flock: If they are <HI>within,</HI> that is, members, they are certainly entitled to &s;ome privilege; and what privilege have they left, if their children mu&s;t not be bap|tized? Did we not learn this in our earlie&s;t infancy, <HI>That

But this you now deny, although you own|ed it in all our church-meetings formerly;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which is the rea&s;on why I never yet attempted fully to prove that point.</NOTE> and you mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity deny it, to be con&s;i&s;tent.

<P>You &s;ay, that you think the cau&s;e I maintained will &s;uf|fer by my managament of it: If &s;o, &s;o much the better for you. You &s;ay, you mean not to attempt to terrify or af|frighten me: I am not &s;o ea&s;ily affrighted out of my du|ty. You &s;ay, that <HI>the mo&s;t experienced Chri&s;tians</HI> among us are on your &s;ide. An&s;. I do not pretend to judge the heart; but I apprehend you are mi&s;taken here. And in your compari&s;ons, I think you are guilty of great unchari|tablene&s;s and cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s; and I mu&s;t in faithfulne&s;s tell you that I verily fear, you conver&s;e <HI>too-little</HI> with your flock to pa&s;s any judgment who are the mo&s;t godly and experien|ced Chri&s;tians, or who enjoy mo&s;t of the pre&s;ence of GOD and the &s;weetne&s;s of religion. You &s;ay, that you do not think there are four women in the whole church with me. If this be true, which I que&s;tion, this &s;hews that you are more a favourite with the women than I am, but does not prove your point. And here I would ob&s;erve, as far as my knowledge reaches, or I have information, that there are very few, if any, men or women, but would be ea&s;y and contented to have the practice continued, if they were not afraid of grieving or lo&s;ing you. You &s;ay, "that it perfectly accords with the pride of the unregenerate heart, to hear that bapti&s;m in infancy and negative evidences are &s;ufficient gound for chri&s;tian charity." What I a&s;tert is, that negative evidences are &s;o far &s;ufficient, that if a baptized per&s;ons, of whom the church knows nothing ami&s;s, &s;hould de&s;ire to own the covenant, or in other words, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the right given him in bapti&s;m, the church could not regularly deny him. Is this &s;uch a dangerous doctrine as you repre&s;ent, and attended with &s;uch dreadful con&s;equences?</P>

But why &s;o? It follows, <Q>The direct and un|avoidable tendency of your opinions, as they have born here di&s;covered, appears to me to overthrow the grand <HI>ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|vini&s;tic</HI> doctrines of the go&s;pel, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the mo&s;t dangerous tenets of the <HI>Arminians.</HI></Q> So that it &s;eems I am not only inclined to the <HI>Arminians,</HI> but am become at once one of the wor&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Arminians,</HI> without knowing it, e&s;tabli&s;hing their mo&s;t dangerous doctrines.

And you might with as much propriety call me an <HI>Arian,</HI> a <HI>Muggletonian,</HI> yea, a <HI>Dei&s;t</HI> as an <HI>Arminian.</HI></P>
<P>But you forgot, that while you were drawing this charge again&s;t me, you <HI>equally</HI> involved my Brethren in the &s;ame

And this was not done &s;uddenly in a pa&s;&s;ion upon the breaking up of the church-meeting, for which &s;ome allowance might be made, but deliberately after three or four days con&s;ideration, and immediately after a day of &s;o|lemn Fa&s;ting and Prayer, in which we might ju&s;tly expect our pa&s;&s;ions would be compo&s;ed.

<P>You know that Mr. <HI>Green,</HI> your favourite Author, whom you read at church-meeting, explodes experiences. He &s;ays, <Q>In the admi&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons we are not to judge from the account of inward experiences, this is not laid down in &s;cripture as the rule of publick judgment; but profe&s;&s;ion and practice.</Q> Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> accords with him, and I &s;up|po&s;e others of your plan in <HI>Connecticut.</HI> And &s;ome of this church know, that you have always &s;poke &s;lightingly of <HI>rela|tions,</HI> and wi&s;hed them laid a&s;ide. The church then, accord|ing to you and your Brethren, mu&s;t regulate her judgment &s;olely by <HI>practice,</HI> that is, <HI>external evidence,</HI> whether negative or po&s;itive it matters not.</P>
<P>This with you is a &s;ufficient foundation for chri&s;tian cha|rity, without any knowledge of their experiences, that is, on the part of the church. Here then I might exclaim, <Q>This per|fectly accords with the natural pride of the unregenerate heart, and their &s;elf ju&s;tifying &s;pirit; this reli&s;hes exceed|ingly with the generality of men to hear that bapti&s;m

Mr. <HI>Robbins,</HI> Who is the <HI>Ar|minian</HI> now? When experiences are &s;et a&s;ide, what is all this but <HI>arminian evidence?</HI> But be not affrighted; after all, nei|ther you nor I are <HI>Arminians.</HI> But all this <HI>rhap&s;ody</HI> &s;prung from a &s;trange confu&s;ion of ideas, or from not duly di&s;tin|gui&s;hing between what is proper evidence for the church to act upon, and what for the party or candidate him&s;elf, which are certainly dificient, at lea&s;t in part, as I doubt not you will acknowledge, when you come to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>You further &s;ay, that <Q>Mini&s;ters and churches in the&s;e days have wretchedly deviated from the de&s;ign of the <HI>Synod.</HI></Q> If this be the ca&s;e, which I que&s;tion, why did you not endeavour to re&s;tore the practice to the original de|&s;ign of it, and not &s;eek the total abolition of it? This, I doubt not, might have been ea&s;ily effected without one church-meeting. It lay entirely in your own brea&s;t whom to propound or not, and I make no doubt you would have been &s;o large in your <HI>practical charity,</HI> however &s;trict in your <HI>notional</HI> or <HI>&s;peculative,</HI> that there would have been but little objection; but few per&s;ons, I believe, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of note, would have been excluded: But it &s;eems the door is &s;hut again&s;t every one, let him be <HI>ever &s;o well qualified,</HI> unle&s;s he &s;ees his way clear to come to the LORD'S table. How in this ca&s;e you can read &s;uch texts as that, <HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. 6, with|out trembling, I cannot imagine. And here I would advi&s;e you not to keep perpetually harping upon <HI>qualifications,</HI> as if this was the chief point in di&s;pute: If this was yielded to you, another grand point remains, Whether it be not &s;inful to exclude any from the privilege of bapti&s;m whom we could charitably receive to the LORD'S &s;upper, meerly becau&s;e they &s;cruple their fitne&s;s for that ordinance? This I look upon as a greater point than the other.</P>
<P>You next charge me with <HI>wickedne&s;s</HI> in calling them <HI>Pa|gans</HI> and <HI>Heathens</HI> who were never baptized or made any pro|fe&s;&s;ion, although they come to meeting, or have opportunity for it if they will. Wherein the <HI>wickedne&s;s</HI> of this con&s;i&s;ts, I know nor: Divines frequently do it. Mr <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> in his

You almo&s;t every Sabbath make them <HI>wor&s;e</HI> than <HI>Heathen,</HI> in &s;aying, <HI>they &s;hall have a more aggravated doom.</HI> Yea, if I remember right, you either in direct terms or in effect called them <HI>Heathens</HI> in treating from <HI>Jer.</HI> x. 25. But &s;uppo&s;ing the phra&s;e <HI>improper,</HI> how can it ju&s;tly be called <HI>wicked?</HI></P>
<P>As for your concluding triumphs, as if certain of the vic|tory, and that your &s;cheme will finally prevail; read 1 <HI>Kings,</HI> xx. 11. But I hope it is not victory that either &s;ide is &s;eeking; but truth. There are &s;ome other things in your Letter that de&s;erve animadver&s;ion; but I forbear.</P>
<P>Upon the whole. I look upon your Letter as a mo&s;t un|chri&s;tian and injurious reflection on me and on a great part of the church; and as you profe&s;s your&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, I think my&s;elf in duty bound to demand &s;atisfaction for the following articles.

<ITEM>1&s;t. Your a&s;&s;uming, lordly, imperious &s;tyle through|out your whole performance; contrary to 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> v. 1. and 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> v. 3.</ITEM>

<ITEM>5th. Your charging me with <HI>wickedne&s;s,</HI> for calling tho&s;e <HI>Heathens</HI> or <HI>Pagans,</HI> who remain unbaptized and never made any profe&s;&s;ion of religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6th. Above all, your charging me with <HI>Arminiani&s;m,</HI> and with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Arminiani&s;m,</HI> &s;uch as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s de&s;tructive to the &s;ouls of men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this without the lea&s;t foundation.</ITEM>

The&s;e things I charge you with, and hope, "when you come calmly to reflect, will ex|cite penitential &s;hame, and be matter of deep humiliation before GOD." And not only &s;o, but induce you to make due acknowledgments to your injured Brethren.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your very obliging, polite, calm, and ingenious Letter ye&s;terday morning, and noted the contents: Am par|ticularly plea&s;ed to find it &s;o free from an "<HI>a&s;&s;umed, lordly, and imperious</HI> &s;tyle," which certainly mu&s;t be an in&s;tance of great conde&s;cention in one of &s;uch eminent eruditition and &s;u|perior knowledge, when &s;peaking or writting to a <HI>"ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, un&s;tu|died young man,"</HI> and one &s;o <HI>"little read in hi&s;tory."</HI> Had I thought it would have been &s;uch <HI>a&s;&s;uming</HI> and arrogancy in me to pre|&s;ume to write to you, Sir, I do not think I &s;hould have dared to have done it. But I mu&s;t &s;ay, I never knew before that it was a crime, or would be looked upon &s;uch pre&s;umption in me to communicate my thoughts freely to you, or make re|marks upon your publick conduct and writings.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> told ore of the Brethren, that in the fir&s;t part of this Letter he followed the example of <HI>Eli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ah, viz.</HI> in his treatment of <HI>Deal</HI>'s Prophets.</NOTE> What I wrote to you contained my real thoughts of your LAST PIECE. I thought verily it was my duty to write it; I did it not in <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>anger,</HI> I con&s;idered my&s;elf as one that had the charge of the &s;ouls of this people committed to me, and who mu&s;t give an account of the various parts of my mini&s;terial con+duct. I con&s;idered the things you advanced, as being of <HI>dangerous tendency</HI> to the &s;ouls of this people; and <HI>I &s;till aix of the &s;ome mind:</HI> I fully believe their tendency to be, to &s;ubvert &s;ome of the <HI>grand doctrines of the go&s;pel</HI> and of <HI>calvin|i&s;m,</HI> and to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome of the mo&s;t dangerous tenets of <HI>Arminiari&s;m;</HI> and therefore &s;hould be guilty of the greate&s;t unfaithfulne&s;s to GOD and them, if I did not oppo&s;e them. And to oppo&s;e them behind your back, without opening my mind freely to you, I and you might ju&s;tly look upon as mean, ba&s;e, and unchri&s;tian. The&s;e, therefore, are the con&s;i|derations, that moved me to write to you, Sir. I acted con|&s;cienciou&s;ly
<PB N="49" REF="012367_0053_0F892571C5D96408">and I think uprightly. "I <HI>with&s;tood</HI> you, <HI>becau&s;e,</HI> I think, you was to be blamed:" I think &s;o &s;till. And &s;hould look upon my&s;elf as a <HI>poor &s;oldier</HI> indeed in the mi|ni&s;terial warfare, if I was afraid to oppo&s;e and expo&s;e <HI>error</HI> meerly becau&s;e it came from one <HI>&s;uperior in age.</HI> As to the grand point in di&s;pute, I am &s;ure I have &s;een no cau&s;e to alter my opinion, from your la&s;t Letter. As to the con|&s;truction you put upon many parts of my Letter, be&s;ides your <HI>mi&s;quotations,</HI> which are many, I would only &s;ay, that it is very far from my meaning or intention; however, if you choo&s;e to con&s;true and under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">land it &s;o, I cannot help it.

My a&s;&s;ertion is as true, as that there is &s;uch a man as Mr. <HI>Robbins;</HI> but this is agreeable to his u&s;ual policy. He had a mind to detach me from my Brethren, and make them believe that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey were no way concerned, that they might leave me <HI>alone,</HI> or al|mo&s;t alone, to be worried by him at his plea&s;ure.

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter was &s;ent back opened.</P>
<P>On the&s;e Letters I remark,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That it was the fir&s;t of the&s;e Letters that began our per&s;onal difference: Before this, we held a good co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;pon|dence, notwith&s;tanding our different &s;entiments about bap|ti&s;m; and might have done &s;o &s;till, if he had managed the controver&s;y with argument in&s;tead of abu&s;e; And whether I gave him &s;uficient ground for turning the di&s;pute into this channel by the preceeding E&s;&s;ay, I leave to the Reader's con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="2">2d. What could be Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI>'s real motive in writing his fir&s;t Letter? His excu&s;e is, that he had not time to an|&s;wer my Piece at the church-meeting, it grew &s;o late, which rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for him to write. If this was the ca&s;e, why did he not argue the point like a man, and endeavour to
<PB N="52" REF="012367_0056_0F89257521A5DC70">refute me, and not write like a <HI>Momus?</HI> Or did he think it too great a conde&s;cen&s;ion for one in "<HI>a &s;tation</HI> &s;o far <HI>above me,</HI>" for one of his &s;uperior penetration and &s;agacity to deign to argue the point with &s;uch a mean Antagoni&s;t? Why, in this ca&s;e, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ens contempt would have been the mo&s;t proper an|&s;wer. Or did he write <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rly to v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt his indignation? He tells us, "he wrote not in a pa&s;&s;ion." Or did he do it purpo&s;ely to pick a quarrel with me? This &s;urely could not be the ca&s;e with a man of Mr. <HI>Robbin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>'s con&s;ummate meek|ne&s;s, a grace that he has &s;o much recommended of late; or was it done to cha&s;tize me for my pre&s;umption in daring to oppo&s;e a men of his con&s;equence? This, I dare &s;ay, he will not own. Or did he write to terrify me from any further op|po&s;ition? He &s;ays, in his Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">he meant not to attempt "to terrify or affrigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the." Or did he think it be&s;t to fini&s;h the controver&s;y with a butcher-&s;troke to knock me down at one blow, (to u&s;e a vulgar phra&s;e?). The&s;e things I mu&s;t leave. The real motive of this conduct is beyond my pene|tration: It fills me with &s;urprize every time I think of it. As to the &s;econd Letter, the de&s;ign of it is not &s;o my&s;terions; it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tly to let me know the &s;uparlative contempt he had for me. There is certainly nothing in either Letter that tends to admini&s;ter con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iction, if I had been ever &s;o wrong; nothing but a torrent of abu&s;e, a rumbling &s;ound of hard words; an overflow of gall and bitterne&s;s. If I had wrote &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Letters to Mr. <HI>Robbins,</HI> I &s;hould have been afraid to walk the &s;treets. This leads me to a&s;k,</P>
<P N="3">3d. Which has written with the greate&s;t a&s;perity? Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> &s;ays, <HI>"I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ronged him in my Letter thirty times is more than he has me in both his."</HI> Here it mu&s;t be remem|bered, that he began the quarrel, and if, by his reflections and abu&s;es, I have been provoked to &s;peak &s;ometimes too har&s;hly. he may thank him&s;elf for it, by giving &s;uch needle&s;s provoca|tion. But how do the reflections on each &s;ide appear upon the compari&s;on? Why, if what he &s;ays of me be true, I am cer|tainly a <HI>grand knave,</HI> and a <HI>dangerous beretick,</HI> wholly unfit to <HI>in&s;truct</HI> or preach any more. But in what light have I repre|&s;ented him? Why, the whole amounts to no more than this, that he has partly forgot his &s;chool logic; that he is no great Divine; that he is not &s;o much conver&s;ant in hi&s;tory as &s;ome &s;cholars are; that he does not <HI>vi&s;it</HI> his people enough to know
<PB N="53" REF="012367_0057_0F892575CBEEF650">who are the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> experienced Chri&s;tians; that there are ma|ny points of divinity that he has neyer fully and particularly handled; that he hath &s;poke &s;lightingly of <HI>relations,</HI> not of <HI>experiences,</HI> as he is plea&s;ed to turn it, which I never ac|cu&s;ed him of; that his di&s;cour&s;e was a <HI>rhap&s;ady, &amp;c.</HI> If the&s;e things be <HI>true,</HI> where is the fault of telling him of them in the <HI>manner</HI> I have brought them in? which I de&s;ire may be noticed. If any of the particulars be magnified beyond bounds, or the expre&s;&s;ions too &s;trong, is the injury done him a thou&s;andth part &s;o great as the injury to me? The differ|ence, I apprehend, is as great, as between the &s;cratch of a pin and a &s;tab through the vitals. Surely, if any one, that was an utter &s;tranger to us both, &s;hould read his Letters, and know no more of me than what is contained in them, he would think me a vile wretch indeed. And if they do me no hurt where I am known, no thanks to him.</P>
<P N="4">4th. What &s;atisfaction is proper in this ca&s;e; and whe|ther the &s;atisfaction offered be &s;ufficient? As Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> has brought <HI>particular</HI> charges again&s;t me, I think the &s;atisfaction ought to be particular, and that a general acknowledgment, or amne&s;ty, is not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the go&s;pel rule, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But what &s;atisfaction has been offered? Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> offered this in <HI>general,</HI> upon our meeting with &s;ome Brethren, refu&s;ing &s;o much as to talk of <HI>particulars, viz.</HI> "You think I have injured you, and I think you have injured me thirty times more by your Letter: Let us make mutual conce&s;&s;ions to each other; let us bury the hatchet, and forget and forgive, and for the future live in love and peace." Here is no acknowledgment either general or particular; but only a bare propo&s;al to let the matter drop, without &s;aying any more about it; or in other words, to make &s;omething of a ballance, and leave off on equal terms, with intimations at the &s;ame time, that he thought it a conde&s;cention in him to come down &s;o <HI>low.</HI> This was the ca&s;e; and yet I under&s;tand I am much blamed by many for not making up on the&s;e terms, and repre&s;ented as <HI>unforgiving implacable,</HI> &amp;c. Even the pulpit has not been free from cen|&s;ure. If I had accepted this, it would have been an implicit conce&s;&s;ion.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. That I was wrong in ever manife&s;ting any di&s;&s;atisfaction at all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. That the charges again&s;t me were well grounded and ju&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. That I acquie&s;ced in the doom he had pronounced upon me, as unfit to <HI>in&s;truct,</HI> &amp;c. And</ITEM>

In &s;hort, the terms offered appear|ed to me a further in&s;ult, rather than any thing that looked like acknowledgment. If he thought proper to in&s;i&s;t upon a general making up, what le&s;s could he have &s;aid, than that his Letters were <HI>ra&s;h, ha&s;ty,</HI> and <HI>unguarded,</HI> and that he was <HI>&s;orry</HI> that ever he wrote them? Or &s;omething of the like tenor; but not &s;o much as this, could be obtained.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But I am weary with remarking, and would give my&s;elf and the Reader &s;ome relief, by proceeding to the next <HI>E&s;&s;ay;</HI> in which, if I have treated him with greater &s;everity, in publick, than be|fore, I tru&s;t I have not exceeded chri&s;tian bounds; if I have, which I am not at pre&s;ent con&s;cious of, I de&s;ire to &s;tand corrected.</P>

<P>QUEST. WHETHER the practice of this church re&s;pect|ing the &s;ubjects of Bapti&s;m be warrantable?</P>

<P>This po&s;ition I look upon as ab&s;urd and irrational and direct|ly contrary to &s;cripture. That childrens member&s;hip is of the &s;ame nature, as full and compleat and as la&s;ting as that of per&s;ons baptized at adult age, and that they can forfeit it no other way but by bad principles or vicious lives, may be proved by the following arguments.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. From the <HI>nature</HI> of <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> which is, according to all Di|vines, the door of entrance into the church. And if it is the door of entrance, then certainly all baptized per&s;ons, whether admitted in infancy, or adult age are members, and there can|not po&s;&s;ibly be any &s;pecific difference between the member|&s;hip of the one and the other. The &s;cripture no where a&s;&s;igns any &s;uch difference; and &s;hall we be wi&s;er than GOD? The following &s;criptures may further illu&s;trate this point. As 1&s;t. The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 25. <HI>As many as have been baptized
<PB N="56" REF="012367_0060_0F89257814234600">into</HI> CHRIST, <HI>have put on</HI> CHRIST; that is, have put on the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of his religion; they are become members of his church; they are in vi&s;ible covenant delation to him: Let them be child|ren or grown per&s;ons, their &s;tanding in the church is the &s;ame. This place &s;eems exactly parallel with that, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 13. <HI>We are all baptized into one body; we are all,</HI> whether infants or a|dult, received into the bo&s;om of the church; we are equally become parts of this <HI>body,</HI> which is but <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the Apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 5. There is but <HI>one</HI> LORD, <HI>one &s;aith, one bapti&s;m.</HI> But according to this new notion, there are <HI>two bapti&s;ms</HI> &s;pecifically di&s;tinct; the one only lays per&s;ons under <HI>bonds,</HI> but the other entitles them to all privileges; which is certainly ab&s;urd. This new doctrine, if true, would in&s;et the nece&s;&s;ity of rebaptization. Accordingly, Dr. <HI>Inc. Mather</HI> ob&s;erves, that rebaptization is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of it: <Q>For it &s;eems, &s;ays he, according to this plan the covenant which the child was in when an infant is become a <HI>meer nul|lity;</HI> &s;o that now being adult, he mu&s;t not renew his cove|nant but enter into a new and other kind of covenant, which he was never i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before: Now it is nece&s;&s;ary, that when a man doth enter into covenant, he &s;hould be initiated by bapti&s;m. There was lately a &s;ot in the world, as Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> tells us, who upon this very ground, although they did acknowledge bapti&s;m of infants as lawful, yet did re|baptize them&s;elves when adult.</Q> Thus Dr. <HI>Mather;</HI> &s;ub|ject of bapti&s;m, p. 65.</P>
<P N="2">2d. We may argue this point further from the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>covenant.</HI> This includes the children equally with the pa|rents; their vi&s;ible covenant relation is the &s;ame. Accord|ingly the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 17. <HI>If the root be holy, &s;o are the branches.</HI> That is, according to all our Divines that are for infant bapti&s;m, if the <HI>parents,</HI> who are the root, be federally <HI>holy,</HI> that is, in covenant with GOD, &s;o are the <HI>children,</HI> which are the <HI>branches,</HI> equally &s;o: The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ive hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;s of the one and the other, are of the &s;ame nature and extent, and not &s;pe|cifically di&s;tinct: They are equally church mem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs.

<PB N="57" REF="012367_0061_0F892578D3F08DA0">and not real holine&s;s. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e the Abo&s;tle &s;ays, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vii. 14. <HI>El&s;e were your children unclean, but now am they holy.</HI> That is, are in covenant with GOD; they are members of the church as well as their parents: There is no difference between the vi&s;ible relation of the one and the other. To the like effect is that declaration, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 39. <HI>The promi&s;e is unto you and to your children.</HI> Infant bapti&s;m is &s;trongly argued by all our Divines from this text; and if the argument is good, it proves infant'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> vi&s;ible member&s;hip to be equal to that of their parents: They are both alike intere&s;ted in the promi&s;e, &s;o far as to have a &s;tanding in GOD'S church.

That the <HI>covenant of circumci&s;ion</HI> was given for <HI>an everla&s;ting covenant;</HI> &s;o that children do not grow out of it by their becoming adult.</P>
<P N="3">3d. We may argue the point from the claims of this cove|nant relation as &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, made by &s;everal particular per|&s;ons after they arrived at adult age. How frequent is this plea in the Old Te&s;tament, <HI>thou art the</HI> GOD <HI>of my Fathers?</HI> Import|ing their pre&s;ent covenant relation to GOD through their pa|rents means; otherwi&s;e there would be no force in the plea: For what benefit would it be if he were <HI>only</HI> the <HI>Father's</HI> GOD, and not the childrens too, by virtue of the covenant? <HI>David</HI> pleads, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> cxvi. 16. <HI>I am thy Servant the &s;on of thy Hand-maid.</HI> He was far from thinking that his <HI>covenant</HI> relation to GOD by virtue of his circumci&s;ion cea&s;ed, when he became capable of acting for him&s;elf; he &s;till holds it to be in is full force as ever; <HI>I am the Son of thy Hand-maid.</HI> I was early given to GOD in circumci&s;ion; that relation or member&s;hip &s;till con|tinues; and upon this ground I beg for covenant ble&s;&s;ings. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Ephraim</HI> u&s;es the &s;ame plea; <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxi. 18. <HI>Turn thou me,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for thou art the</HI> LORD <HI>my</HI> GOD. He does not call GOD <HI>his</HI> GOD, becau&s;e he thought he had a &s;pecial &s;aving in|tere&s;t in GOD at this time; for he verily thought him&s;elf un|converted; but pleads his covenant relation to GOD by vir|tue of circumci&s;ion, as an argument for &s;pecial grace which &s;hews that that relation &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted when he was grown up. The pious Mr. <HI>Vincent,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of Conver&s;ion, inter|prets the text thus. Says he, <Q>Under the Old Te&s;tament every <HI>I&s;raelite</HI> that in <HI>infaa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI> had been <HI>circumci&s;ed in the fle&s;h,</HI> might go unto GOD for <HI>converting grace,</HI> for a <HI>circum|ci&s;ed heart;</HI> and go to him as unto a GOD, who had <HI>&s;ealed a covenant</HI> to him. <HI>Ephraim</HI> upon this &s;core calls the

And the great Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> formerly of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> interprets this text in <HI>Jer.</HI> in the &s;ame manner in his Sermon on Infant Bapti&s;m, p. 19, 25. And I believe it is the &s;en&s;e that Divines generally put upon it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;on why I enlarge on this text is, that it being mentioned by me in my <HI>fir&s;t Piece,</HI> the &s;en&s;e I put on it was denied, which rendered &s;uch enlargement nece&s;&s;ary. It is omitted <HI>there,</HI> to avoid needle&s;s repetitions.

<P N="4">4th. We may argue this point from many other divine de|clarations. <HI>The kingdom of</HI> GOD <HI>&s;hall be token from you,</HI> &s;ays CHRIST, <HI>and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</HI> Matt. xxi. 43. That is, they &s;hould be deprived of their co|venant relation to GOD by virtue of circumci&s;ion; they &s;hould be cut off from their member&s;hip in the vi&s;ible church, which is here called <HI>the kingdom of</HI> GOD, and the <HI>Gentiles</HI> &s;hould be admitted in their flead. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e is <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. The Apo&s;tle there declares at large how the <HI>Jews</HI> were <HI>broken off.</HI> That is, unchurched, and the <HI>Gentiles gra&s;&s;ed</HI> in their room, <HI>to partake of the root and fatne&s;s of the olive-tree.</HI> Their vi&s;ible relation to GOD by means of circumci&s;ion was at an
<PB N="59" REF="012367_0063_0F89257A53D63F40">end. And innumerable declarations of the like nature are to be found in the Old Te&s;tament. That text is remarkable, <HI>Jer.</HI> iii. 14. <HI>Turn, O back&s;liding children, &s;aith the</HI> LORD; <HI>for I am married to you.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We were in effect told the Sabbath after this Piece was delivered even in publick Prayer, and &s;ince that in a Ser|mon, that this text was addre&s;&s;ed to back&s;liding believers: But this could not be; the addre&s;s was made to the whole people of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and they were almo&s;t univer&s;ally corrupt at this time: Read not only the context, but <HI>Jer.</HI> V. 1. and ix. 2 and indeed the whole prophecy.</NOTE> That this is &s;poken of <HI>unregenerates</HI> is abundantly evident from the context; and yet GOD calls them <HI>children;</HI> that is, children of the covenant, within the pale of the church; and the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>I am married to you,</HI> is &s;till more &s;trong: He does not &s;ay, <HI>I will be married to you if you turn;</HI> but, <HI>I am married to you;</HI> to denote their pre&s;ent cove|nant relation to GOD. They had not lo&s;t their member|&s;hip received in circumci&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding their vile de|generacies; and this he urges as one of the &s;tronge&s;t motives to repentance and conver&s;ion. GOD was willing to receive them, notwith&s;tanding their repeated adulteries and breaches of wedlock; <HI>though ye have played the harlot with many lovers, yet return unto me, &s;aith the</HI> LORD, ver. 1. Again, how often does GOD call the <HI>I&s;raelites his people,</HI> from one generation to another, even in the time of the greate&s;t degeneracy; and this upon account of their vi&s;ible covenant relation to him, or being members of his church by virtue of circumci&s;ion. And this relation continued until GOD gave them <HI>a bill of divorce</HI> at the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> and <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> captivities, when he pronounced <HI>lo-ammi</HI> upon them. That is, <HI>they &s;hould be no lon|ger his people nor be their</HI> GOD. <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> i. 9, and <HI>Jer.</HI> iii. 8. And the &s;ame doom was pronounced upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> &s;ometime after CHRIST'S death, by the Apo&s;tles, when they were wholly un|churched and deprived of their vi&s;ible covenant relation or member&s;hip. <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. and el&s;ewhere. All this &s;erves to &s;hew, that member&s;hip received in infancy by circumci&s;ion or bap|ti&s;m never cea&s;es but continues in adult age, until a people or particular per&s;on be regularly cut off or ca&s;t out by &s;ome im|mediate act of GOD, or by the act of the church in the exer|ci&s;e of di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>We may al&s;o prove, that infant-member&s;hip continues after they arrived to &s;uch years, as to be capable of mini&s;terial teach|ings, con&s;equently of per&s;onal covenanting, from <HI>John</HI> xxi. 15.
<PB N="60" REF="012367_0064_0F89257B14ED6818"><HI>Feed my lambs,</HI> &s;ays CHRIST to <HI>Peter.</HI> They who are given to me in circumci&s;ion or bapti&s;m, are <HI>my lambs;</HI> they have my mark upon them; I own them &s;till as part of my <HI>flock;</HI> they have not lo&s;t their member&s;hip, now they begin to be capable of acting for them&s;elves: Therefore <HI>feed</HI> them as belonging to my fold; <HI>feed</HI> them as well as the more adult <HI>&s;heep;</HI> they are all equally members.

<P N="5">5th. This doctrine is attended with great inconveniencies, and &s;everal gro&s;s con&s;equences re&s;ult from it, which are not to be admitted. 1&s;t. It puts baptized and unbaptized per&s;ons all upon a par or level: They &s;eem to be exactly in the &s;ame &s;ituation, if the former are grown out of the church, and all relation cea&s;es at adult age; we may well then object as tho&s;e did of old; <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 1. <HI>What advantage then hath the Jew?

And indeed it has been always e&s;teemed a great privilege by the people of GOD for them&s;elves and theirs to be under the covenant.

This leads me to ob&s;erve, 2d. This doctrine tends to &s;adden the hearts of godly parents. It is a comfortable con&s;ide|ration to them, whether living or dying, that their children or rela|tives
<PB N="61" REF="012367_0065_0F89257BD7BCC840">are under the wing of the covenant, although not as yet converted; they hope covenant mercy will reach them in due time; they look upon this as a weighty plea with GOD in prayer, and accordingly u&s;e it; as <HI>David</HI> did for his &s;on <HI>So|lomon.</HI> 1. Chron. xxix. 19.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pious Mr. <HI>David Jennings,</HI> in his Sermon on this text, &s;ays, <Q><HI>David</HI>'s argument here is, <HI>give unto Solomon,</HI> MY SON.

GOD forbid. 3d. This doctrine in effect condemns the practice of GOD'S people in their prayers for reformation. How frequent is this plea in &s;cripture, and that in the wor&s;t times of degeneracy, LORD, <HI>we are thy peo|ple; we are called by thy name,</HI> &amp;c. The meaning is, we are thy people in vi&s;ible covenant; we were devoted to thee in circumci&s;ion; this relation &s;till continues at adult age; there|fore give this people the grace of the covenant. But how vain and futile does this place appear to be, if infant member&s;hip be wholly lo&s;t, when per&s;ons become capable of acting for them|&s;elves, or of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> covenanting. 4th. This doctrine in ef|fect makes infant bapti&s;m a meer nullity; or at mo&s;t a mean,

<P>My Brethern, I beg to know what infants are baptized for, if they are not made members of GOD'S church? To what end is this ordinance? Of what benefit and advantage? And are not the <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> right in laying it a&s;ide? If you &s;ay, it is to lay them under <HI>&s;tronger bands</HI> to be the LORD'S when they grow up. Pray, what &s;cripture have you to prove, that this is the <HI>only end</HI> of bapti&s;m? If the greater arguments from the con|&s;ideration of GOD'S being our Creator, Pre&s;erver, Governor, and Redeemer, will not prevail, how little can be expected from this? I mu&s;t profe&s;s, that, if I thought the&s;e <HI>bonds</HI> were all that was imported in infant's bapti&s;m, and that there was no con&s;ideration to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e had of the <HI>privileges</HI> accompanying the re|lation, and of the expectation we may rationally have of GOD'S ble&s;&s;ing attending his own in&s;titution, I &s;hould not think tho&s;e much to blame who wholly rejected infant bapti&s;m.

<PB N="63" REF="012367_0067_0F89257D4E4D8790">manu&s;cript Hi&s;tory. <Q>In 1629, the two Mini&s;ters of <HI>Salem</HI> being &s;eriou&s;ly &s;tudious of reformation, they con&s;i|dered of the &s;tate of their <HI>children,</HI> together with their pa|rents; concerning which, Letters did pa&s;s between Mr. <HI>Hig|gin&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brew&s;ter,</HI> the reverend Elder of the church of <HI>Plymouth;</HI> and they did <HI>agree in their judgments, viz. con|cerning the church member&s;hip</HI> of the children with their pa|rents, and that bapti&s;m was a <HI>&s;eal</HI> of their <HI>member&s;hip:</HI> Only when they were adult, they being not <HI>&s;candalous,</HI> they were to be examined by the <HI>church-officers,</HI> and upon their appro|bation of their fitne&s;s, and upon the children's publick and per&s;onal owning of the covenant, they were to be received unto the LORD'S &s;upper. Accordingly Mr. <HI>Higgin&s;on</HI>'s el|de&s;t Son, being about fifteen years of age, <HI>was owned to have been received a member together with his parents;</HI> and being privately examined by the Pa&s;tor, Mr. <HI>Shelton,</HI> about his <HI>knowledge in the principles of religion,</HI> he did pre&s;ent him be|fore the church, when the LORD'S &s;upper was to be ad|mini&s;tred; and the child then publickly and per&s;onally own|ing the covenant of the GOD of his Father, he was admitted unto the LORD'S &s;upper.

<P>But it would be endle&s;s to cite human te&s;timonies, &s;ince this has been the univer&s;ally received opinion of Mini&s;ters and churches from CHRIST'S time to this day; except Mr. <HI>Daven|port,</HI> Mr. <HI>Street,</HI> and two or three others in the time of the <HI>Synod,</HI> and a few <HI>Connecticut</HI> Mini&s;ters, &amp;c. in our days; who are forced to advance the contrary ab&s;urd doctrine, in order to uphold their oppo&s;ition to the practice recommended by the <HI>Synod.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, as Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> expre&s;&s;ly granted at the la&s;t church-meeting, that, according to our Catechi&s;m, <HI>the infants of &s;uch as are members of the vi&s;ible church are to be baptized;</HI> and, as I have fully proved that baptized per&s;ons are members of the vi&s;ible church, it undeniably follows, that their chil|dren are to be baptized; and none can lawfully deny them this privilege, unle&s;s they have forfeited it by their wickedne&s;s.
<PB N="64" REF="012367_0068_0F89257E1B97DBA8">What an amazing thing then is it, that any are &s;o fond of principles, urging them with &s;o much heat and vehemence, that tend &s;o directly to unchurch their po&s;terity, and leave them in the &s;tate of outca&s;ts and aliens to GOD'S covenant?</P>
<P>If what has been &s;aid, does not &s;atisfy, I de&s;ire that Dr. <HI>Inor.

There is really no more connexion be|tween this practice and <HI>arminiani&s;m,</HI> than between it and <HI>a|thei&s;m.</HI> And I challenge all the world to &s;how the contrary. If there is &s;uch a connexion, then Mr. <HI>Leonard,</HI> your former beloved Pa&s;ter, was an <HI>Arminian;</HI> then this church have been <HI>Armini|ans</HI> for forty one years, ever &s;ince they introduced this practice, and Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> was an <HI>Arminian</HI> for the fir&s;t nine years of his mini&s;try, while he held to this practice.

Hence they will unavoidably be led to think, <HI>that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are likewi&s;e ju&s;tified by works in the &s;ight of</HI> GOD. con&s;equently St. <HI>James</HI> holds doctrines of an <HI>arminian</HI> tendency.

<P N="3">III. I now pa&s;s to make &s;ome ODOERVATION for the &s;ur|ther illu&s;trating the point, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="65" REF="012367_0069_0F89257FADF79FB8">
1&s;t. I think the controver&s;y is greatly mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tated. By Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI>'s management and arguments, one would think that the di&s;pute here is the &s;ame that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at <HI>North-Hampton</HI> &s;ome years ago between Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and his people. But this is not the ca&s;e; for Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> meddles little or no|thing with <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> but the LORD'S <HI>&s;upper;</HI> and all his di&s;cour&s;e is about qualifications for that, which I never yet pretended to di&s;claim; neither did it ever enter into my heart, that the chief de&s;ign of our church-meetings was to determine, whethes Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI>'s doctrine about the LORD'S &s;upper was right or not. The di&s;pute here relates entirely to the initiating or|dinance of <HI>bapti&s;m.</HI> And even as to this, the controver&s;y is not; whether they &s;hould be <HI>vi&s;ible Chri&s;tians</HI> that offer them&s;elves or not; we agree that they &s;hould be &s;uch. In what then do we differ? Why, 1&s;t. our opponents &s;ay, that the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> &s;ort of evidence of grace is nece&s;&s;ary in this ca&s;e; we &s;ay the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> is &s;ufficient, e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to per&s;ons already baptized, as bapti&s;m is a facrament of entrance.</P>
<P>But what is this <HI>highe&s;t &s;ort</HI> of evidence that they in&s;i&s;t on? Why, this is a my&s;tery that I could never yet unfold. Is it a particular relation of experiences? No; this, they &s;ay, is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; this is not the &s;tandard that the &s;cripture gives for the church to judge by. What then is it? Why, <HI>profe&s;&s;ion and practice,</HI> or the life and conver&s;ation. To this we again agree: In what then do we differ but in words? But if Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> now &s;ays, contrary to all his former declara|tions, that a relation is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, how can he look upon tho&s;e, who have already owned the covenant as members in full communion, as he &s;ays he does, that never made any &s;uch relation? What an incon&s;i&s;tency would be here? 2d. They &s;ay, that none &s;hould come to bapti&s;m, but they &s;hould immediately come likewi&s;e to the LORD'S &s;upper. But we &s;ay, they may come to the one ordinance and not to the other in &s;ome ca&s;es; that baptized per&s;ons, of regular conver&s;ati|ons, have right to come, and none have right to deny them: Here then the di&s;pute chiefly lies, and not &s;o much about <HI>qua|lifications.</HI> Why then do we hear &s;o much concerning them, as if the hinge of the controver&s;y lay here? If Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> would only receive tho&s;e whom he calls <HI>qualified,</HI> to own the covenant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he would meet with little oppo&s;ition. But it &s;eems they mu&s;t be excluded without they will come im|mediately to full communion, let their &s;cruples be what they will, which is what I think he cannot an&s;wer to GOD or the church. Wherefore I de&s;ire to hear no more about qualificati|ons,
<PB N="66" REF="012367_0070_0F892581E562EC40">about <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>gracious &s;incerity,</HI> which are terms I never u&s;ed, until this point be &s;ettled.</P>
<P N="2">2d. I ob&s;erve, that it is peculiar to tho&s;e of the <HI>congregational way</HI> to have a church, as it were, within a church; to make di&s;tinction between members at large, and members <HI>in particular,</HI> between communicants and others. All other per&s;ua&s;ions rec|kon bapt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zed per&s;ons &s;uch members, as to be entitled to all church privileges whenever they demand them, if they lay no bar in the way by their wickedne&s;s: Which is the rea&s;on why we read of no di&s;putes in &s;uch churches about the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, &s;uch as &s;ub&s;i&s;t among the <HI>congregationi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3d. I ob&s;erve, our Brethren of the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, are exactly like tho&s;e <HI>Di&s;ciples,</HI> who becau&s;e the <HI>Jews,</HI> we read of in &s;cripture, did not follow CHRIST &s;o <HI>fully</HI> and in the <HI>man|ner</HI> they expected and required, <HI>forbad them to bring their child|ren to</HI> CHRIST. But CHRIST &s;ays, <HI>&s;orbid them not, for of &s;uch is the kingdom,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4th. I ob&s;erve, that if a per&s;on baptized &s;ays, <HI>that as far as he knows his own heart, he is &s;incerely willing to give up him&s;elf and his children to</HI> GOD, that is enough. The Mini&s;ter &s;hould go no further. He has no bu&s;ine&s;s to puzzle and confound him with a long di&s;cour&s;e about <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>gracious &s;incerity,</HI> which it is likely the candidate will under&s;tand little of.</P>
<P N="5">5th. I ob&s;erve, that if a man offers him&s;elf to either ordi|nance, only to <HI>be &s;een of men,</HI> &amp;c. and knows it, nothing that can be &s;aid to him about <HI>grace</HI> will hinder him: He will come, let the Mini&s;ter &s;ay what he will. But it is only the <HI>tender con|&s;cienced,</HI> that have been under <HI>&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">k of the Spirit,</HI> that will be &s;cared and terrified away by the pre&s;ent har&s;h method of treating the &s;ubjects. So here is the utmo&s;t danger, as I have ob&s;erved heretofore, <HI>of breaking the brui&s;ed read, and quench|ing the &s;moaking flax,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6">6th. I ob&s;erve it as a certain maxim of truth, that if a man declares upon oath more than he knows, he is guilty of <HI>perjury,</HI> though it &s;hould happen afterwards to be true. If a man then publickly profe&s;&s;es, that GOD <HI>is his</HI> GOD, and that he has <HI>&s;av|ing faith,</HI> and does not know it to be &s;o, though it &s;hould ap|pear afterwards to be the ca&s;e, he certainly goes beyond the line of truth; he &s;olemnly, and, as it were, upon oath declares that to be true, which he does not know but may be fal&s;e; which is the very e&s;&s;ence of a lye. Con&s;equently there can be no covenanting with GOD upon this new &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">me, without a <HI>cer|tain knowledge</HI> of a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s gracious &s;tate. And in addition to
<PB N="67" REF="012367_0071_0F8925845ED710B8">this I ob&s;erve, that Mr. <HI>Robbins,</HI> according to his plan, mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily tell every candidate that offers, that it is <HI>&s;aving faith</HI> he <HI>prefe&s;&s;es,</HI> when the covenant is propounded to him; and he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily tell him further, that if he <HI>has not</HI> &s;aving faith, he <HI>cannot profe&s;s it.</HI> How then can &s;uch a candidate proceed one &s;tep further, without he <HI>knows</HI> he has &s;aving faith? Or further, where is the con&s;i&s;tency to tell a man that it is enough for him to &s;ay that he <HI>hopes</HI> he has &s;aving faith, when di&s;cour&s;ed with in private; if, when he comes into publick, he mu&s;t ab&s;o|lutely profe&s;s &s;aving faith, without any <HI>hope &s;o</HI> in the ca&s;e? How can the&s;e things hang together? But what are the&s;e <HI>prevail|ing hopes.</HI> founded on &s;cripture evidence, &s;o much talked of? Are they not in effect the &s;ame with a&s;&s;urance? Prevailing hopes may be accompanied with <HI>doubes</HI> and <HI>fears;</HI> and &s;o may <HI>a&s;&s;urance: Full a&s;&s;urance</HI> I know excludes all doubts, but not &s;o the other; there are <HI>degrees</HI> of a&s;&s;urance. So that I do not &s;ee why they need &s;tart &s;o much at the word <HI>a&s;&s;urance,</HI> when they hold the &s;ame thing in other words. Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> u&s;es the word, <HI>knowledge</HI> or <HI>knowing</HI> in this ca&s;e, which is certainly as &s;trong a term as a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P N="7">7th I ob&s;erve, that the word <HI>&s;oul</HI> is much u&s;ed in this contro|ver&s;y; and indeed it &s;eems that almo&s;t all the arguments u&s;ed on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion are founded on this word: People are &s;o continually dinned and drowned with it, that they imagine there is more in it than there is. Therefore I &s;hall add a little on this point. There is no <HI>go&s;pel ordinance</HI> what&s;oever but carries the <HI>nature,</HI> the very <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> of a <HI>&s;eal. Prayer</HI> is a &s;eal of the covenant of grace. When we &s;ay, <HI>our Father which art in Heaven</HI> in &s;incerity, we &s;et to our &s;eal that GOD is <HI>our Father.</HI> Hearing is a &s;eal; when we heartily be|lieve the truths delivered, <HI>we &s;et to our &s;eal that</HI> GOD <HI>is true. John</HI> iii. 33. <HI>Reading the word</HI> is a &s;eal; when we apply the law or go&s;pel to our &s;ouls, we &s;eal the truth of it. Mu&s;t then all unregenerate men be debarred from the&s;e ordinances, be|cau&s;e the&s;e, <HI>properly u&s;ed,</HI> are &s;eals, always &s;eals, of the covenant of grace? No, &s;ay they, the&s;e <HI>are moral duties,</HI> and therefore ought to be performed by all; but bapti&s;m and the LORD'S &s;upper are <HI>po&s;itive &s;pecial in&s;titutions,</HI> and are only to be per|formed by true believers. Here then the argument from the <HI>nature of a &s;eal</HI> is given up: It is in effect granted, that unre|generate men may partake of <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the &s;eals of the covenant of grace, though not of <HI>others;</HI> and the rea&s;on why they are ex|cluded
<PB N="68" REF="012367_0072_0F892585ECD39DD0">from the one and not from the other, is not taken from the <HI>nature of a &s;eal,</HI> but from a <HI>different ground, viz.</HI> the one's being of a <HI>moral</HI> and the other of <HI>po&s;itive</HI> in&s;titution. How ab|&s;urd then is this way of rea&s;oning taken meerly from the <HI>nature</HI> of a <HI>&s;eal?</HI> But to follow then the argument a lit le further. The argument from the nature of a &s;eal being given up, and another foundation e&s;tabli&s;hed in its room, let us &s;ee how far this will hold. The &s;acraments, &s;ay they, are <HI>po&s;itive &s;pecial</HI> in&s;titu|tions, and therefore confined to believers. But does not this prove too much? May not the &s;ame be &s;aid of all the <HI>&s;acrifices</HI> under the law, as well as of the pa&s;&s;over, bapti&s;m, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> They were not of a <HI>moral</HI> nature, but of <HI>po&s;itive &s;pecial</HI> in&s;titution. Mu&s;t not then an unregenerate <HI>Jew</HI> engage in the <HI>daily &s;acrifice,</HI> or the &s;acrifices offered every Sabbath, becau&s;e of po&s;itive in&s;titu|tion? Why, this would have de&s;troyed all publick wor&s;hip at once among the <HI>Jews.</HI> If none but <HI>regenerates</HI> mu&s;t have come to the <HI>temple,</HI> (which were &s;o few generally) what thin a&s;&s;emblies would they have had. It follows then that as ordinances be|ing meerly of <HI>po&s;itive &s;pecial in&s;titution,</HI> is not in it &s;elf a &s;ufficient bar to <HI>unregenerates</HI> attending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on them. So that both their grounds here fail them. But what does all this arguing tend to, will they &s;ay, but to encourage unregenerate men, knowing them&s;elves to be &s;uch, to come to both &s;acraments? I an&s;wer, this is not my de&s;ign in it, but only to &s;hew the <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> of the argument taken from the <HI>nature</HI> of a <HI>&s;eal, &amp;c.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are &s;ome <HI>other con&s;iderations</HI> which render it not proper, that bapti&s;m and the LORD'S &s;upper &s;hould be made as <HI>com|mon</HI> as the other ordinances; but the argument for their re&s;trictive u&s;e, taken meerly from the rature of a &s;eal, proves nothing either one way or the other.</NOTE> But thus much I &s;ay, if a per&s;on under ferious religious impre&s;&s;ions &s;hould out of a &s;en&s;e of duty come to either ordinance, he &s;ins <HI>le&s;s</HI> in <HI>com|ing</HI> than in <HI>&s;taying away,</HI> though it &s;hould afterwards appear that he was unregenerate at the time. This leads me,</P>
<P N="8">8th. To take notice of &s;ome ab&s;urd doctrines delivered by the chief promoter of the new &s;cheme. The&s;e are Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI>'s words <Q>When a natural man owns the covenant, or pretends to own it, for it is impo&s;&s;ible for &s;uch a man to own the co|venant of grace really, he &s;ins again&s;t GOD in a more pro|voking manner than if he had committed <HI>drunkenne&s;s, for|nication,</HI> and <HI>adultery;</HI></Q> p. 48. And the rea&s;on he gives is,
<PB N="69" REF="012367_0073_0F8925864DC69898">becau&s;e &s;uch are guilty of <HI>lying to</HI> GOD <HI>and perjury:</HI> This, we may ob&s;erve, is &s;poken not only of <HI>wilful hypocrites,</HI> who do all to be &s;een of men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but of all unregenerate men what&s;oever let them be under ever &s;o great religious impre&s;&s;ions, ever &s;o &s;e|rious or con&s;ciencious in what they do. This I &s;tick not to call <HI>horrible doctrine,</HI> contrary to &s;cripture and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;on. Accord|ing to this, 1&s;t. <HI>Ahab</HI> &s;inned more in <HI>humbling him&s;elf</HI> and <HI>walking &s;oftly,</HI> which nece&s;&s;arily implies his <HI>confe&s;&s;ing his &s;in</HI> and <HI>promi&s;ing</HI> reformation; I &s;ay, that he &s;inned more in doing this than in murdering <HI>Naboth</HI> and taking away his vineyard by inju&s;tice and violence. 2d. According to this doctrine, <HI>Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> &s;inned more in promoting, and the people in joining in <HI>renewing covenant,</HI> than they would have cone in murdering a whole city, or all turning <HI>drunkards</HI> and <HI>adulterers:</HI> For, it is evident by the peoples after apo&s;tacy, that their hearts were not generally right with GOD in the tran&s;action. 3d. Accord|ing to this doctrine, the King and the people of <HI>Niacvah</HI> &s;inned more provokingly in repenting and reforming <HI>in the manner they did,</HI> than they would have if they had murdered <HI>Jonah</HI> and bid defiance to the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> 4th. According to this doctrine, if a &s;inner unconverted in a time of &s;ickne&s;s or other great di&s;tre&s;s, &s;hould acknowledge his &s;ins and <HI>premi&s;e</HI> reforma|tion with all appearing earne&s;tne&s;s, he is all the while commit|ting a greater &s;in in <HI>promi&s;ing,</HI> than drunkenne&s;s or adultery.

<P>For my part, I always thought, and it is the opinion of al|mo&s;t all Divines, that a particular per&s;ons or a peoples per&s;orm|ing a duty with any &s;ort of &s;incerity, was a <HI>le&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> &s;in than a <HI>total neglect, &amp;c.</HI> And as to <HI>&s;pecial ordinances,</HI> particularly, although I think they ought to be <HI>vi&s;ible Chri&s;tians</HI> that come; yet that if they do come coa&s;ciencion&s;ly, though unconcerted, their &s;in is not &s;o great and provoking, as a contemptuous turning their back upon the ordinance. The &s;criptures tell us, that he that was not circumci&s;ed, or did not eat the pa&s;&s;over, was to be <HI>out off from his people;</HI> that is, put to death: But no &s;uch puni&s;hment was threatned to an untegenerate man that performed tue duty.</P>
<P>But what &s;ignifies mens coming to &s;pecial ordinances, if their hearts be not engaged in the duty? What is here but
<PB N="70" REF="012367_0074_0F8925889C91D7C0"><HI>meer form?</HI> And what can be more provoking than that? I an&s;wer, the <HI>form</HI> of religion compared with the <HI>power,</HI> is a <HI>little thing;</HI> but in it&s;elf it is a <HI>great thing:</HI> But where that remain|ed, GOD hath graciou&s;ly returned many and many a time to his people. But when both <HI>form</HI> and <HI>power</HI> were gone, there never was an in&s;tance of GOD'S remaining with that people, but they were made examples of vengeance.</P>
<P N="9">9th. I ob&s;erve, that we &s;eem to be agreed in this, that none but <HI>vi&s;ible Chri&s;tians</HI> or <HI>believers</HI> &s;hould be admitted to either ordinance. But when they come to explain them&s;elves, it is evident that by <HI>vi&s;ible Chri&s;tians</HI> they mean <HI>real Chri&s;tians;</HI> &s;o confounding all di&s;tinction between the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> and <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> church, in direct contradiction to almo&s;t all Divines. And herein they talk ju&s;t as the <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> do, who de&s;troy all differ|ence between the <HI>external</HI> and <HI>internal</HI> parts of the covenant.</P>
<P N="10">10th. I ob&s;erve, that Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> the great writer again&s;t the <HI>Synod,</HI> was con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf: He profe&s;&s;edly acknow|ledges that the church had nothing to do with the baptized im|mediately in a way of di&s;cipline, as not being <HI>immediate</HI> members. But our Pa&s;tor called the church together at their fir&s;t meeting, partly to <HI>di&s;cipline the baptized children of the church;</HI> which im|plies, that he thought them to be <HI>immediate members:</HI> And this is a matter that yet lies under our con&s;ideration underermined If he has &s;ince altered his mind he ought publickly to declare that he was then in an <HI>error,</HI> and that he did wrong in propo|&s;ing <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> to the church, or our calling tho&s;e to account with whom we have nothing to do, according to his pre&s;ent princi|ples. This would be <HI>ingenuous,</HI> and what the church have a right to expect, if he has led them in a wrong path, or propo|&s;ed what ought not to be propo&s;ed. <HI>For what have we to do to judge them that are without?</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 12.</P>
<P N="11">11th. I would ob&s;erve, upon a pa&s;&s;age that &s;ell from Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> at la&s;t church-meeting. He &s;aid, <HI>that &s;ome who had taken the pains to turn to the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture that were produced of the Synod,</HI> &s;aid, <HI>they found them nothing to the purpo&s;e to prove their point;</HI> which &s;hews, that he takes upon tru&s;t what is al|ledged on that &s;ide, and that he never examined them him&s;elf. Is this an impartial way of proceeding? Is this the manner of a <HI>lover of truth,</HI> to &s;ee with others eyes? On the contrary. I a&s;&s;ert that the&s;e texts are much to the purpo&s;e, and that he would have found them &s;o, if he had given them an <HI>impartial</HI> examina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion.</P>

12<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h. I would ob&s;erve, the policy of &s;ome to get this practice aboli&s;hed. They endeavour to in&s;till into people, that the whole de&s;ign of the <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> is to get Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> away; hoping, if &s;uch a notion be once imbibed, it will put then into &s;uch a ferment, that they will join in aboli&s;hing the practice right or wrong, in order to keep Mr. <HI>Robbins.</HI> But how unju&s;t is this? And what gro&s;s uncharitablene&s;s does it involve in it? Pray, who was it fir&s;t brought this di&s;pute into the church? Not we, &s;ure. Who is it that are for <HI>innovation?</HI> Not we: And mu&s;t we <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> to innovations, for fear our Mini&s;ter &s;hould run away from us? Not we, unle&s;s our con&s;ciences were convinced. If Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> is re&s;olved to leave us, if he cannot gain his point, we cannot help it; we mu&s;t do our duty, and leave the event to GOD. As for any <HI>direct de&s;ign</HI> to get him away, it never en|tered into my heart; and I never heard any thing li&s;ped by my Brethren tending that way: All our de&s;ign is, I can &s;peak it for my&s;elf, and believe it of my Brethren; I &s;ay, all our de|&s;ign is to di&s;charge our con&s;ciences and do our duty: We think the point of <HI>very great importance,</HI> and cannot give it up. And in order to promote peace, we have alrealy propo&s;ed an <HI>expe|dient</HI> that would make all ea&s;y, and hurt no man's con&s;cience. But with what contempt was it rejected.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As &s;oon as I had fini&s;hed reading this Piece to the church; Mr. <HI>Robbins,</HI> in&s;tead of an&s;wering the argument, made a few general reflections a The &s;ub&s;tance was, <Q>That I darkned coun&s;el with words without knowledge; that I dre&s;&s;ed him up in bear&s;kins; that the whole of my Piece was calculated to repre&s;ent him in a ridiculous light; that he <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> it before, but was now <HI>confirmed</HI> in it, that <HI>our whole de&s;ign</HI> was to get him away.</Q> Thus, in direct terms in the face of the church, giving me <HI>the lye</HI> after &s;uch &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations.</NOTE></P>
<P>If we patiently &s;ubmit in this point, meerly to plea&s;e or keep Mr. <HI>Robbins,</HI> who will ever dare to &s;peak again&s;t <HI>innovations</HI> again, let them come ever &s;o fa&s;t? We have had &s;omething <HI>new</HI> &s;tarted to trouble the churches peace, I think, every two or three years &s;ince his &s;ettlement; And who can a&s;&s;ure us, that it will not be &s;o hereafter, until the whole of the <HI>Canazdicut di&s;ciplins</HI> be brought in upon us?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Scare any are ignorant that the di&s;cipline in <HI>Connecticut</HI> ver|ges towards <HI>Pre&s;yteriani&s;m;</HI> and it is natural for tho&s;e brought up under &s;uch a con&s;titution to be bla&s;&s;ed in his favour; and therefore we may expect it will be thou&s;t in upon us, if we tamely &s;ubmit in other things.</NOTE> If any make the lea&s;t, <HI>oppo&s;ution,</HI> why
<PB N="72" REF="012367_0076_0F89258A127A1A40">they will be immediately branded with a de&s;ign of getting away Mr. <HI>Robbins;</HI> and then it mu&s;t pa&s;s without controul. But I tru&s;t the Brethren are better fortified than to be led away by &s;uth in&s;inuations; and hope that <HI>whi&s;perers, talc bearers,</HI> and <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ers of di&s;cord</HI> among Brethren will be di&s;appointed of their aim, according to the directions we had la&s;t Sabbath, and agreeable to the Apo&s;tle's advice; <HI>Rom.</HI> xvi. 17. <HI>Mark them which cau&s;e divi&s;ions and offences contrary to the doctrine which we have learned, and avoid them.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, I hope whatever the Brethren do in this matter will be founded upon <HI>full conviction of con&s;cience;</HI> I &s;ay, <HI>full conviction of con&s;cience;</HI> and that they will not be influenced one way or the other meerly to plea&s;e any man what&s;oever; and that they will not hold the doctrine of CHRIST with <HI>re&s;pect of per&s;ons;</HI> but with all impartiality will pa&s;s their judgment, as they will an&s;wer it at the bar of CHRIST.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with &s;ome PROPOSALS. And my.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t propo&s;al is, in&s;tead of contending what privileges belong to the children of the church, we had better unite in granting them &s;ome <HI>privilege;</HI> and then &s;et upon the vigorous exerci&s;e of <HI>di&s;cipline:</HI> And we may hope for GOD'S ble&s;&s;ing in <HI>reforming,</HI> or at lea&s;t in <HI>re&s;training</HI> our licencious youth.</P>
<P N="2">2d. I would propo&s;e this churches &s;olemnly <HI>renewing covenant</HI> on a day of fa&s;ting and prayer, according to the model of our Fathers. This has been found a happy expedient of reviving religion in timer of great degeneracy; the divine ble&s;&s;ing u&s;u|ally accompanying it; as we &s;ee in the time of Kings <HI>Hezeki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h,</HI> and in the days of our Fathers. This tends to re|vive a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n&s;e of covenant vows and enpagements, both in com|municants and the children of the church, and excites a more &s;trict and circum&s;pect walk.</P>
<P N="3">3d. I would propo&s;e that the church, by a <HI>formal vote,</HI> adopt the method I propo&s;ed the la&s;t town-meeting, <HI>viz.</HI> for a neigh|bouring Mini&s;ter to baptize the children of the church, as long as Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI>'s &s;cruples remain: By which it will appear, that we have no de&s;ign of &s;oreing Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> to act again&s;t his con&s;cience, as the matter is repre&s;ented abroad, or of getting him away. We are willing to give him liberty of con&s;cience;
<PB N="73" REF="012367_0077_0F89258AEB6738A8">and expect the &s;ame liberty from him. And &s;hould think it hard, if he endeavours to prevent any Mini&s;ter's coming.</P>
<P N="4">4th. and la&s;tly, I would propo&s;e, that &s;eeing Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI>'s chief &s;tick is about <HI>qualifications,</HI> if he will go on with the practice, he may <HI>examine</HI> the candidate as much as he plea&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> though we think there is no divine warrant for it, with re&s;pect to per&s;ons baptized; but we would by no means have the practice wholly laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>As to the method propo&s;ed, of receiving the candidates to full communion, and then di&s;pen&s;ing with their coming to the LORD'S table, which is again reurged, I have &s;aid enough be|fore. I would only add, that I look upon It as <HI>the old practice &s;poiled:</HI> A few circum&s;tances mu&s;t be added to reader it non|&s;en&s;ial, ridiculous and contradictory in it&s;elf. No church in the province practices any thing like it. A report indeed we have, that one church in <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">necticut</HI> have adopted &s;ome &s;uch &s;cheme, whether true or not we cannot tell; And if there be &s;omething in it, we have no particular account of the plan; and &s;hall we meerly upon &s;uch a vague report, without con|&s;ulting one Mini&s;ter or church, make &s;uch a material alteration as this? What pre&s;umption? What head-long <HI>Jehu</HI>-like act would it be? I am confident, not one man that &s;hould vote for it, but would be a&s;hamed of it before a twelve-month came about. May the LORD keep us from wrong paths: May he lead us into all truth, and direct us in the way of duty. May this church &s;till retain its precious privileges, and tran&s;mit them inviolate to the late&s;t po&s;terity: And may no <HI>weapon</HI> formed again&s;t its welfare pro&s;per.</P>
<P>Perhaps tho&s;e who live at a di&s;tance may be de&s;irous to know how this di&s;pute terminated. Why, in &s;hort, the church, with a view to peace, have voted to "di&s;&s;olve the meeting and to drop the affair for the pre&s;ent, and to rea&s;&s;ume the confiderati|on thereof when they &s;hall think proper." Thus the matter is left in &s;u&s;pence. The practice remains unrepealed, and the Mini&s;ter as much un&s;atisfied with it as ever. So that the door &s;eems at pre&s;ent &s;trut again&s;t all comers. How things will finally i&s;&s;ue, is beyond me to &s;ay. But I tru&s;t GOD will over|rule all to his glory, and the be&s;t good of his church and peo|ple, and bring this controver&s;y at la&s;t to a happy</P>
