<P>_IT is a plea&s;ant and wondrous Thing, to &s;ee Souls flying to JESUS CHRIST, to the Means of Grace and Salvation which He has ordained and &s;anctified, and into his Church. If this were not the proper and natural Sen&s;e of the <HI>Prophet</HI>'s Words, I would not have cho&s;e them for the Opening the pre&s;ent <HI>Lecture.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>dear People,</HI> Your <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> have with Plea&s;ure &s;een you in the Weeks pa&s;t, Old and Young, Parents and Children, Ma&s;ters and Servants, high and low, rich
<PB N="6" REF="004490_0004_100D585BF3F8DAF8">and poor together, gathering and pa&s;&s;ing as <HI>Clouds</HI> in our Streets, and as <HI>Doves</HI> on the Wing in Flocks flying to the Doors and Windows of our Places of Wor&s;hip; and hovering about the &s;ame, tho&s;e that could not get in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fame</HI> of a &s;ingular fervent and <HI>holy Youth,</HI> an ex|traordinary Servant and Mini&s;ter of JESUS CHRIST, (who makes his <HI>Angels Spirits,</HI> and his <HI>Mini&s;ters a Flame of Fire)</HI> had prepar'd you for his <HI>Vi&s;it;</HI> and with rai&s;ed Expectations we received him, even as an <HI>Angel of</HI> GOD for JESUS &s;ake; as the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> was received by the Churches in <HI>Galatia.</HI></P>
<P>GOD gave him a wonderful <HI>Manner of Entrance</HI> among us, ju&s;t as in other Places before us, among the <HI>Brethren</HI> of our Denomination; and we were &s;ometimes <HI>melted</HI> together in Tears, Mini&s;ters and People, Parents and Children, under the commanding <HI>Addre&s;&s;es of Love</HI> to his <HI>Saviour</HI> and our <HI>Souls.</HI> We led you with a vi&s;ible Plea&s;ure in our Faces to the &s;olemn and great <HI>A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> and look'd on You there with great Sati&s;|faction, in your uncommon Regards to the Beloved <HI>Ser|vant of</HI> CHRIST, for the <HI>Truth's &s;ake that dwelleth</HI> in Him, and the <HI>Love of the Spirit</HI> filling him, and reigning in his Mini&s;trations to us.</P>
<P>And now our beloved <HI>Brethren and Si&s;ters,</HI> You and your <HI>Children,</HI> we are going to <HI>prove,</HI> confirm and in|crea&s;e, by the Will of GOD, the &s;eeming good Di&s;po|&s;itions begun or revived in You, toward CHRIST and his <HI>Word,</HI> in a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable pious Care and <HI>Solli|citude</HI> for your Salvation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> once and again in his <HI>Admonitions</HI> to You, and al&s;o in his <HI>fervent,</HI> righteous and <HI>effectual Prayers</HI> for you (by the Will of GOD) led you into <HI>this Trial</HI> and Proof of your &s;elves;&mdash;"Whether when he was gone from us, you wou'd <HI>better attend</HI> on the Mi|ni&s;try of your <HI>own Pa&s;tors,</HI> both on <HI>Sabbaths</HI> and <HI>Lectures?</HI> For he had <HI>heard</HI> (and it was but too <HI>true</HI>) that there had been a very great <HI>Defect</HI> in this Point among you
<PB N="7" REF="004490_0005_100D585EE3A751C0">before he came.&mdash;Some of your <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> therefore now make a new <HI>Tender</HI> of them&s;elves to you, in the Fear and Love of GOD, in this <HI>new Lecture,</HI> for the Service of your Souls, if you will encourage them by &s;omething of a <HI>like Attendance</HI> on it, as we have lately &s;een you give to the Word preach'd. &mdash; We preach the &s;ame CHRIST, the &s;ame <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> and <HI>according to Godline&s;s,</HI> with the &s;ame Go&s;pel <HI>Motives</HI> and Argu|ments, Applications to Con&s;cience, and Supplications to GOD for You.&mdash; We would look on the <HI>Fields,</HI> and be|hold them <HI>white</HI> for the <HI>Harve&s;t,</HI> and de&s;ire to <HI>enter</HI> into it; if by the Help of GOD we may <HI>cheri&s;h</HI> the Impre&s;|&s;ions made on any of your Souls, and carry them on, clinching the <HI>Nails</HI> driven by the <HI>Ma&s;ter of A&s;&s;emblies</HI> that has been &s;ent among us.&mdash;For though we are <HI>Elder Mini&s;ters,</HI> and have been many Years before Him in the Service of Souls, and <HI>He</HI> like <HI>David</HI> going again&s;t <HI>Goliah,</HI> in the Sight of the <HI>Armies of I&s;rael,</HI> has been &s;een to be but a <HI>Youth</HI> and <HI>Stripling;</HI> yet are we not unwilling or a&s;hamed to come and &s;erve <HI>after Him,</HI> in the <HI>Battles</HI> of our LORD, and in the <HI>Victories</HI> of his Grace. &mdash; You have &s;een, as it were, a young <HI>Elias,</HI> or the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> ri&s;en again, a <HI>burning and &s;hining Light,</HI> and you were <HI>willing for the Sea&s;on to rejoice in his Light and Heat:</HI> May <HI>we</HI> now <HI>preach</HI> and <HI>you hear</HI> for the <HI>future</HI> with more Life and Spirit, Diligence and Con&s;tancy; and by the Will of GOD with new <HI>Succe&s;s.</HI>&mdash; But we mean not, <HI>Bre|thren,</HI> at <HI>this Lecture</HI> only, but on <HI>every</HI> Sabbath and <HI>every</HI> Lecture in the Town; and more particularly on the public <HI>Thur&s;day Lecture;</HI> which has been &s;hamefully neglected by the <HI>Town.</HI></P>
<P>To come then to my <HI>Text,</HI> which I acknowledge the late <HI>Concour&s;e</HI> to the <HI>Word</HI> among us, has led me to chu&s;e. I wou'd now look round on the <HI>pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly,</HI> and look back on our <HI>pa&s;t</HI> A&s;&s;emblies, and &s;ay to You,&mdash;</P>
<P><Q><HI>Who are the&s;e that fly as a Cloud, and as the Doves to their Windows?</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Prophet</HI> was here meditating the <HI>Glory</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> in the abundant <HI>Acce&s;s of the Gentiles</HI> to it.
<PB N="8" REF="004490_0006_100D58611B4DBF00"><HI>Ari&s;e, &s;hine,</HI> (&s;ays he Ver. 1.) <HI>for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>is ri&s;en upon thee.</HI> It was a <HI>light|&s;ome</HI> Thought to the holy Prophet, the <HI>inlarged</HI> State of the Church, after its long <HI>Confinement</HI> within the nar|row Bounds of <HI>Judea;</HI> and after its Diminution and <HI>Ob&s;curation</HI> by the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Captivity. He foretels, <HI>V.</HI> 2, this Time of <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> covering the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>gro&s;s Darkne&s;s the People;</HI> out of which the Church &s;hou'd <HI>emerge,</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles come to her Light, and Kings to the Brightne&s;s of her ri&s;ing.</HI> Ver. 3.</P>
<P>Wherefore, <HI>Ver.</HI> 4, &s;he is call'd upon to <HI>lift up her Eyes,</HI> and <HI>&s;ee round about,</HI> the People gathering and <HI>flow|ing</HI> to her. And though at <HI>fir&s;t</HI> there might be &s;ome <HI>Fear</HI> and Di&s;tru&s;t, as <HI>Peter</HI> felt, when he was about to go unto the <HI>Uncircumci&s;ed;</HI> yet that wou'd be <HI>&s;oon over,</HI> and her narrow <HI>doubting</HI> Heart <HI>enlarg'd</HI> with Joy; (<HI>V.</HI> 5.) becau&s;e of the <HI>Abundance of the Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Forces of the Gentiles,</HI> coming to her.&mdash; This Acce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Gen|tiles</HI> to CHRIST is further repre&s;ented, <HI>Ver.</HI> 6, 7, by the <HI>Multitudes of Camels, laden with Incen&s;e</HI> and <HI>Offerings of Gold;</HI> and the <HI>Flocks of Kedar</HI> pre&s;enting them&s;elves for <HI>Sacrifices</HI> to the <HI>Altar</HI> of GOD. The Riches of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> together with their Hearts, devoted to GOD in and through CHRIST, for the &s;etting up and &s;upporting his <HI>In&s;tituted Wor&s;hip,</HI> is the Thing here repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>And thus (&s;ays the HOLY ONE, in the Words im|mediately preceeding my Text) <HI>will I glorify the Hou&s;e of my Glory.</HI>&mdash;GOD'S <HI>Church</HI> is the Hou&s;e of his <HI>Glory,</HI> where he is <HI>glorified</HI> by his People, and where he <HI>glorifies</HI> him&s;elf in his <HI>Grace</HI> to them. The <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> is here, to make it <HI>more glorious</HI> than ever. The <HI>Chri&s;tian Church State</HI> makes it &s;o: The <HI>Mini&s;tration</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> was <HI>glorious,</HI> but the <HI>Go&s;pel exceeds in Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Vi&s;ion of this</HI> it is, that the <HI>Prophet</HI> as in a Surprize and Exta&s;y <HI>exclaims,</HI> in the Words of my Text, "<HI>Who are the&s;e that fly as a Cloud, and as the Doves is their Windows.</HI> He mightily admires this <HI>flocking of Converts to</HI> CHRIST.
<Q>The <HI>Manner</HI> wherein he
<PB N="9" REF="004490_0007_100D5863E23E8290">expre&s;&s;es his <HI>Admiration</HI> is more <HI>elegant</HI> and moving, than if he had only &s;aid,&mdash; I &s;ee an <HI>infinite Number</HI> coming into the Church. He &s;peaks <HI>magnificently</HI> of the thing, &s;ays <HI>Calvin,</HI> and as wanting Words to utter his Wonder and Joy.</Q>&mdash; When the <HI>Church</HI> return'd from <HI>Babylon,</HI> &s;he left many a <HI>Pro&s;elyte</HI> to the true GOD <HI>behind</HI> her, and &s;ome <HI>follow'd</HI> her; but <HI>tho&s;e</HI> were a &s;mall <HI>Fir&s;t-fruit,</HI> and as the <HI>Sheaf</HI> in token of the <HI>Harve&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Prophecy</HI> began eminently to be fulfilled in the wonderful Conver&s;ions to CHRIST, by the preaching of his <HI>Apo&s;tles. "The I&s;les &s;hall wait for me;"</HI> are the Words following my <HI>Text;</HI> the many <HI>I&s;les</HI> in the <HI>Medi|terranean</HI> were &s;oon vi&s;ited, and the remote <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> very &s;oon, con&s;idering its Di&s;tance, and Separa|tion from the <HI>Continent.</HI></P>
<P>But the Prophecy is <HI>daily</HI> fulfilling, and at <HI>Times</HI> in a more remarkable Mea&s;ure; but more e&s;pecially it will be &s;o in the <HI>latter</HI> and more happy Days of the Church, when the <HI>Calling of the Jews</HI> and the <HI>Fulne&s;s of the Gen|tiles</HI> &s;hall come on.&mdash; The LORD ha&s;ten the promis'd Day.</P>
<P>It is the <HI>Power of Godline&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>&s;aving Conver&s;ion</HI> of Souls that is here &s;poken of. The bare outward Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, the <HI>Name and Form</HI> alone, without the Power of Religion, were not <HI>worthy</HI> of this Affection and Joy; <HI>Who are the&s;e that fly,</HI> &amp;c. We have not &s;o <HI>learned</HI> CHRIST, as to &s;peak thus of any thing &s;hort of the <HI>&s;aving Efficacy</HI> of the preached Go&s;pel on the Hearts and Lives of Men, "<HI>turning them from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto</HI> GOD. In this <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> let us con|template and admire the <HI>Event</HI> in my Text, "<HI>Who are the&s;e that fly as a Cloud,</HI> &amp;c!</P>
<P>In which Words is repre&s;ented, 1. The <HI>Number and Multitude</HI> of Converts to CHRIST. 2. Their Speed, <HI>Swiftne&s;s,</HI> Eagerne&s;s, Earne&s;tne&s;s. 3. The <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> GOD has in this <HI>Event,</HI> and <HI>Souls</HI> &s;hou'd have in it; both Mi|ni&s;ters and People.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004490_0008_100D586627BB5748">
And &s;o the <HI>Doctrine</HI> is, That it is a plea&s;ant and ad|mirable Thing, to &s;ee Souls <HI>flocking</HI> and <HI>ha&s;tning to</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P>But I will dwell a little more on the <HI>Phra&s;eology</HI> of the Text, "There &s;hou'd be a flying as the <HI>Cloud</HI> before the <HI>Wind:</HI> and as the <HI>Doves</HI> on the <HI>Wing,</HI> to their <HI>Windows.</HI></P>
<P>And 1. Let it be as a <HI>Cloud before the Wind,</HI> a Thing common in the&s;e <HI>lower Heavens</HI> about us, the <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> wherein we breathe and move: for the Clouds come <HI>down</HI> &s;ometimes to our very Hou&s;es, and terribly in their <HI>Lightnings</HI> and <HI>pe&s;tilential</HI> Vapours.&mdash;But when the Cloud is <HI>light</HI> and flies <HI>high,</HI> we &s;ee it cro&s;s the Heavens <HI>&s;wiftly,</HI> on the Wings of the Wind. &mdash; The <HI>Cloud</HI> &s;preads <HI>wide</HI> at Times, over&s;preads the Face of the Sky, or a great Part of it, and then may well &s;tand for a <HI>Multitude:</HI> A <HI>Cloud,</HI> i. e. a <HI>Croud</HI> of People; as when we read of "<HI>&s;o great a Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> Heb. xii. 2. a <HI>few</HI> of which had been enumerated. So &s;pake the Prophet <HI>Eze|kiel,</HI> Chap. 38. of <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> the Enemies of GOD and his <HI>I&s;rael; "Thou &s;halt be as a Cloud to cover the Land, thou and all thy Bands and many People with thee.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Cloud</HI> flies in the <HI>open Heavens,</HI> in the open Sight; and &s;o &s;hou'd <HI>we</HI> be <HI>open,</HI> in the View of all, confe&s;&s;ing CHRIST and coming into his Church; with a con&s;picuous Zeal, that may appear to Friends and Foes. We may not be <HI>a&s;ham'd</HI> of the Name of CHRIST, nor <HI>cover</HI> our Profe&s;&s;ion, nor <HI>fear</HI> to expre&s;s a <HI>Zeal</HI> for his Cau&s;e, Intere&s;t and Glory. Let the <HI>timerous Ma&s;ter in I&s;rael</HI> come <HI>alone to</HI> JESUS <HI>by Night;</HI> but let his <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> chu&s;e rather to go in <HI>a Body</HI> and by <HI>Day.</HI> We read of the <HI>ri&s;en Witne&s;&s;es of</HI> CHRIST, that they heard a <HI>Voice</HI> from <HI>Heaven,</HI> to them &s;aying, "<HI>Come up hither!</HI> and they <HI>a&s;cended in a Cloud,</HI> and as a Cloud, and their <HI>Enemies beheld them.</HI> In Allu&s;ion to which, all that pro|fe&s;s the glorious Name of CHRIST &s;hou'd make <HI>one Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> and <HI>a&s;cend</HI> up after Him, Earth and Hell looking on: Phil. iii. 3. <HI>We are the Circumci&s;ion, that
<PB N="11" REF="004490_0009_100D586807DDA048">wor&s;hip</HI> GOD <HI>in the Spirit, and rejoice in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Cloud flies irre&s;i&s;tibly;</HI> no Art or Power of Man can <HI>&s;top</HI> it; &s;o our Profe&s;&s;ion of the Name of CHRIST mu&s;t be <HI>above any Ob&s;truction,</HI> Let or Impedi|ment, from Earth or Hell. There &s;hou'd be a Faith and Love and Zeal, that &s;hall carry us <HI>above</HI> Temptati|ons, Difficulties and <HI>Oppo&s;itions!</HI> an open and <HI>effectual Door</HI> &s;hou'd be <HI>open'd,</HI> which <HI>none</HI> &s;hou'd be able to <HI>&s;hut;</HI> a <HI>Love which many Waters &s;hall not quench, nor the Floods drown.</HI> Once more.</P>
<P>As the Clouds fly <HI>high,</HI> &s;o our Hearts and Affections &s;hou'd be <HI>rais'd</HI> and <HI>elevated</HI> above the <HI>World</HI> and all <HI>Earthly</HI> Things that <HI>wou'd draw them down.</HI> We mu&s;t be <HI>looking to</HI> JESUS <HI>at the right Hand of</HI> GOD, <HI>and &s;et our Affections on Things above;</HI> as <HI>ri&s;en with Him</HI> and a&s;cend|ing after him in heavenly Frames and A&s;pirations, to be <HI>with him where he is.</HI></P>
<P>Or, 2. Let the Flight of Souls to CHRIST be <HI>as the Doves to their Windows;</HI> which is the other, and more plea&s;ant <HI>living,</HI> lively Part in the Compari&s;on; or what is there among the <HI>winged Fowl</HI> of Heaven, more <HI>beauti|ous, clean</HI> and <HI>innocent,</HI> more <HI>meek, loving</HI> and <HI>lovely</HI> than the <HI>Doves!</HI> As the <HI>De&s;cent</HI> of the HOLY GHOST on the LAMB OF GOD at his <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is likened to that of the <HI>Dove;</HI> &s;o how pleas'd &s;hou'd our <HI>Souls</HI> be, to have their <HI>A&s;cent to</HI> CHRIST illu&s;trated by this Similitude!</P>
<P>The <HI>Doves ha&s;ten</HI> on their Wings, and fly <HI>&s;wiftly;</HI> more e&s;pecially as they return to their <HI>Windows;</HI> with Plea&s;ure and Joy they <HI>dart</HI> and light there. So let us be <HI>glad</HI> to go to the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of the LORD, and there let our <HI>Feet re&s;t.</HI> Why are we <HI>loth</HI> at any Time to go? why make we no more <HI>ha&s;te</HI> and &s;peed to JESUS CHRIST, to find <HI>Re&s;t</HI> for our Souls, <HI>Food,</HI> Dwelling, and a Place of <HI>Safety;</HI> a Covering from the <HI>Wind and Tempe&s;t,</HI> and from the <HI>Powers of the Air</HI> that would devour us; the <HI>Hawk and Vultur?</HI></P>

<P><HI>Parents,</HI> won't you come to the Windows of the LORD, and bring your <HI>Children</HI> with you.

<P>Shall I &s;peak now to <HI>Elder People,</HI> that have been &s;adly dilatory, &s;adly negligent, and have not &s;o much as crawl'd all their Life long into the Church of GOD and the Fellow&s;hip of his Saints! &mdash; Reverence to the <HI>Age</HI> of &s;uch &s;hould have requir'd me to have &s;poken to Them before; forgive the Indecency and accept the Love of addre&s;&s;ing you now. &mdash; My LORD bids me &s;ay to you, now at the <HI>Eleventh Hour,</HI> <Q>Why &s;tand you here all the Day of Life loitering and Idle?

I &s;hall only go into <HI>one</HI> more particular Point of <HI>Application;</HI> and that is to <HI>convinced and awakned Sin|ners,</HI> and to <HI>true Converts</HI> and <HI>comforted Saints.</HI></P>
<P>We have &s;een of late many <HI>greatly affected</HI> under the preaching of the Word; now <HI>Cheri&s;h your Convictions,</HI> and beg of GOD, by the Power of his HOLY SPIRIT, to fa&s;ten 'em deep in your Souls. Fear, O fear, le&s;t your Goodne&s;s prove as <HI>the Morning Cloud or Evening Dew, that pa&s;&s;es away</HI> before the next Days Noon. Improve the little Heat and Life you feel, and pray for a thorow <HI>&s;aving Conver&s;ion.</HI> Cry to the tender SAVIOUR, <Q>Who will not break the brui&s;ed Reed, nor quench the &s;moaking Flax, but brings forth Judgment unto Victo|ry.</Q> May He an&s;wer you with good Words and comfortable; "<HI>Son, Daughter, thy Sins be forgiven.</HI> O may it indeed be the <HI>Day of his Power, and the Time of his Love</HI> with your Souls! And when you are ready to take the <HI>Words of Peace,</HI> take Care that <HI>you turn not again to Folly.</HI> <Q>Watch and pray, that you enter not into Temptation: When the Spirit &s;eems mo&s;t willing, remember that the Fle&s;h is weak.</Q>
<Q>Strait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way, that leadeth to Life, and few there be that find it. <HI>Strive</HI> there|fore, has the LORD &s;aid to us, for many &s;hall <HI>&s;eek</HI> to enter, and &s;hall not be able.</Q></P>
<P>Go, carry thy <HI>Sins,</HI> and not thy <HI>Penitence</HI> to the LORD JESUS, and ca&s;t a poor peri&s;hing Soul on &s;overeign Mercy and free Grace. When he asks thee,
<Q>What wilt thou that I &s;hould do unto thee? An&s;wer, LORD &s;ave me I peri&s;h! LORD that I may receive my Sight? LORD, that I may be made clean and whole of my Plague!</Q></P>
<P>We have admir'd to &s;ee how many of you have been of late affected! we &s;hall admire more, wonder and be a&s;ham'd and griev'd, if we &s;ee your Affections <HI>cool</HI> and go off! if <HI>Sabbaths and Ordinances are neglected</HI> as heretofore, or <HI>formally</HI> attended. If you have <Q>begun in the Spirit, take heed that it end not in the Fle&s;h. Confer not with Fle&s;h and Blood, as ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Paul</HI> tells
<PB N="27" REF="004490_0025_100D588C15EBE488">us he did <HI>not, when it plea&s;ed</HI> CHRIST <HI>to reveal Him|&s;elf in him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And now to You, <HI>my Brethren that are in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, who have <HI>cho&s;en the</HI> LORD <HI>to &s;erve him,</HI> and have <HI>taken his Yoke</HI> upon you, <HI>ea&s;y and light</HI> to your Souls; <Q>let the Joy of the LORD be your Strength; go on your Way rejoicing! He meeteth him that rejoiceth, and worketh Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, them that remember him in his Ways. Lift up the Hands that hang down, &s;trengthen the feeble Knees. Thank GOD, who has wrought all your Works in you and for you, and &s;o far carried you on, kept and recovered you; thank GOD and take Courage. Say, I will never forget thy Precepts, for by them thou ha&s;t quickened me, I will run the Way of thy Commandments as thou enlarge&s;t my Heart. &mdash; The Grace of our LORD JESUS CHRIST be with your Spirits! the Peace of GOD which pa&s;&s;es all Under&s;tanding, keep your Hearts and Minds thro' CHRIST JESUS, Unto Him be Glory in the Churches for ever and ever. AMEN.</Q></P>
