<HEAD>An Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the Truth of this Hi&s;tory en&s;uing, be&s;ides circum&s;tances of place, per&s;on, time, occa&s;ion, &s;o exactly ob&s;erved; I refer my&s;elf to the Relation of tho&s;e godly men, who in &s;everal languages have manife&s;ted to the world the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages thereof; and although I am not ignorant, that at the fir&s;t they were not only not credited, but al&s;o di&s;|credited and &s;landered by &s;uch as found them to be a blur to the <HI>Roman</HI> profe&s;&s;ion, yet they lo&s;t not their lu&s;tre thereby; but being ac|quitted by many compurgators of &s;everal na|tions, and &s;ome of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> religion, being all of them &s;pectators of this tragedy; it oc|ca&s;ioned not only a further manife&s;tation and confirmation of the truth, but al&s;o a large and more frequent confluence to &s;ee that which they had formerly only heard of. This partly appears out of the &s;ucceeding &s;tory; but more fully out of an apology written by <HI>Ver|gerius</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Ju&s;tinople,</HI> who was accu&s;ed for di&s;per&s;ing the fame of this example to the &s;tain of <HI>Popery,</HI> in which apology to <HI>N. Rotan,</HI> &s;uffragan of <HI>Padua,</HI> is &s;hortly and plainly de|clared, what was &s;aid, what was done, and who were pre&s;ent. If it be demanded, what moved me to compile this treati&s;e? <HI>Spira,</HI>

tell them, that it &s;hould teach fear and reve|rence: and indeed among all tho&s;e that came to &s;ee him, few or none returned un&s;haken. <HI>Vergerius</HI> in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle &s;aith; <Q>I would fain go &s;ee him again, but I exceedingly fear and tremble:" and in his apology &s;aith, It is &s;uch a rare example, as I would wil|lingly go to the furthe&s;t parts of the world to hear or &s;ee the like.</Q> The lady <HI>Jane</HI> to her father's chaplain (who had fallen into <HI>Spira</HI>'s &s;in) &s;aith, <Q>Remember the lamenta|ble &s;tate of <HI>Spira.</HI></Q> I acknowledge that there hath been formerly a book publi&s;hed in our mother-tongue, concerning this &s;ubject, but as far as I can learn (for I could never yet obtain to &s;ee any one of them) it was nothing &s;o large and various as this pre&s;ent treati&s;e: and as I have heard, a tran&s;lation of only one of the tractates, from whence I have gather|ed this pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e in part. Concerning my care and fidelity in this bu&s;ine&s;s, it is &s;uch as I may truly &s;ay without changing of colour, that there is not one &s;entence of all this work attributed unto the per&s;on of <HI>Spira,</HI> but it hath its warrant, either from the epi&s;tles of <HI>Verge|rius</HI> and <HI>Geribaldus,</HI> profe&s;&s;ors of the law in <HI>Padua,</HI> or from the di&s;cour&s;es of <HI>Henry Scrin|ger, a Scotchman, Sigi&s;mund Gelons,</HI> a <HI>Tran|&s;ylvanian,</HI> and <HI>Mart.

<HEAD>A RELATION of the fearful E&s;tate of <HI>Francis Spira.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1548, when the glorious Sun of the Go&s;|pel was but newly ri&s;en in <HI>Europe,</HI> in the days of the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth of that name King of <HI>England:</HI> In the territory, and under the juri&s;diction of the city of <HI>Venice,</HI> being the very border of <HI>Italy,</HI> in the town of <HI>Citadella,</HI> lived one <HI>Francis Spira,</HI> a civil lawyer, an advocate of great rank and e&s;teem, being of known learning, and eloquence; of great experience; of carriage circum&s;pect and &s;evere; his &s;peech grave and compo&s;ed, his countenance &s;harp au&s;tere; every way befitting that authority whereunto he was advanced, endowed with outward ble&s;&s;ings, of wife and eleven children, and wealth in abundance: what his wor&s;t parts were, I have no other warrant, than his own words, which (if not tainted over|much with the bitterne&s;s of a de&s;perate mind, and bearing the countenance rather of pa&s;&s;ion, than of &s;ober confe&s;&s;ion) may &s;eem to add a period to all further commendations.</P>
<P><HI>I was</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>exce&s;&s;ively covetous of money, and accord|ingly I applyed my &s;elf to get by inju&s;tice, corrupting ju&s;tice by deceit, inventing tricks to elude ju&s;tice: good cau&s;es I ei|ther defended deceitfully or &s;old them to the adver&s;ary perfidi|ou&s;ly; ill cau&s;es I maintained with all my might; I witting|ly oppo&s;ed the known truth; and the fir&s;t committed unto me, I either betrayed or perverted.</HI> Thus having worn out forty four years, or there abouts, and the news of the new, or rather newly revived opinions of <HI>Luther</HI> coming unto tho&s;e parts, repre&s;ented an object of novelty unto him; who being as de&s;irous to know as he was famous for knowledge; &s;uffered not the&s;e wandering opinions to pa&s;s unexamined,
<PB N="8" REF="009059_0007_10306B18893F9590">
but &s;earching into the &s;criptures, and into all books of controver&s;y that he could get, both old and new, and finding more than fame or opinion, he began to ta&s;te their nature &s;o well as that he entertains, loves and owns them at length; and with &s;uch zeal, as he became a profe&s;&s;or; yea a teacher of them, fir&s;t to his wife, children, and fa|mily, and after to his friends, and familiar acquaintance; and in compari&s;on, &s;eemed to neglect all other affairs; intending ever to pre&s;s this main point, that <HI>We mu&s;t wholly, and only depend on the free, and unchangeable love of God in the death of Chri&s;t, as the only &s;ure way to &s;alva|tion:</HI> And this was the &s;um of all his di&s;cour&s;e, and this continued for the &s;pace of &s;ix years, or there-abouts; even &s;o long that this fire could not keep it&s;elf within private walls, but at length it brake forth unto public meetings; &s;o that the whole province of <HI>Padua</HI> dawned with the lu&s;tre thereof. The clergy finding the trade of their pardons to decay; and their purgatory to wax cold, began to &s;tir them&s;elves: glo&s;ing their actions fir&s;t with calumnious a&s;|per&s;ions upon the whole profe&s;&s;ion, then more plainly &s;triking at <HI>Spira</HI> with grievous accu&s;ations: And to effect their purpo&s;e, &s;ome promi&s;e labour, others favour, &s;ome advice, others maintenance; all join to divide, either his &s;oul from his body, or both from God.</P>
<P>Now as <HI>John Ca&s;a</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI>'s legate re&s;ident at <HI>Venice,</HI> by birth a <HI>Florentine;</HI> and one that wanted neither malice again&s;t tho&s;e of this way, nor craftines to effect his mali|cious purpo&s;es: To him the&s;e men repair with outcries again&s;t <HI>Spira;</HI> that he was the man that condemned the received rights of the Church, eluded the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, and &s;candalized the policy thereof; one of no mean rank; being a man of account and authority, and there|unto, learned in the &s;criptures, elegant in &s;peech; and in one word, a dangerous <HI>Lutheran;</HI> having al&s;o many di&s;|ciples, and therefore not to be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>At this began the legate to ca&s;t his eye on the terrible alteration that lately had happened in <HI>Germany;</HI> where,
<PB N="9" REF="009059_0008_10306B1B4472BBA0">
by the means of only one <HI>Luther,</HI> the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> religion had &s;uffered &s;uch a blow, as that it could neither be cured by di&s;&s;imulation, nor defended by power; but the clergy mu&s;t either mend their manners, or lo&s;e their dignities: on the other &s;ide, when he &s;aw how propen&s;e the common peo|ple inhabiting in the bordering countries of <HI>Italy</HI> were to entertain tho&s;e new opinions, he now thought it no time to di&s;pute, or per&s;wade, but with &s;peed repairs to the &s;e|nate, and procures authority from them to &s;end for <HI>Spira.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spira</HI> by this time had con&s;idered with him&s;elf of the nature of his carriage, how evident and notorious it was and therefore &s;ubject to be envied by &s;uch as neither liked his per&s;on nor religion, he perceived that his opinions were neither retired nor &s;peculative, but &s;uch as aimed at the overthrow of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> fiction, and a change of policy, (wherein at the be&s;t he could expect but a bloody victory,) and that his enemies wanted neither power nor occa&s;ion to call him to account in public, when he mu&s;t either apo&s;tatize, and &s;hamefully give his former life, yea his own con&s;cience the lye, or endure the utmo&s;t malice of his deadly enemies, or for&s;ake his wife, children, friends, goods, authority, yea, his dear country, and betake him|&s;elf to a foreign people, there to endure a thou&s;and mi&s;eries, that do continually wait upon a voluntary exile. Being thus di&s;tracted, and to&s;&s;ed in the re&s;tle&s;s waves of doubt without guide to tru&s;t to, or haven to fly to for &s;uccour; on a &s;udden, God's Spirit a&s;&s;i&s;ting, he felt a calm, and began to di&s;cour&s;e with him&s;elf in this manner:</P>
<P><HI>Why wondere&s;t thou thus in uncertainties, unhappy man; ca&s;t away fear, put on thy &s;hield, the &s;hield of faith: Where is thy wonted courage, thy goodne&s;s, thy con&s;tancy? remember that Chri&s;t's glory lies at the &s;take, &s;uffer thou without fear, and he will defend thee, he will tell thee what thou &s;halt an|&s;wer; he can beat down all danger, bring thee out of pri&s;on, rai&s;e thee from the dead: con&s;ider</HI> Peter <HI>in the dungeon, the martyrs in the fire, if thou make&s;t a good confe&s;&s;ion, thou may&s;t indeed go to pri&s;on, or death, but an eternal reward in
<PB N="10" REF="009059_0009_10306B1DF1B87848">
heaven remains for thee; what ha&s;t thou in this world com|parable to eternal life, to everla&s;ting happine&s;s? if thou do&s;t otherwi&s;e think of the &s;candal; (common people live by ex|ample, thinking whatever is done, is well done) fear the lo&s;s of peace and joy, fear hell, death, and eternal wrath; or if thy fle&s;h be &s;o &s;trong, as to cau&s;e thee to doubt of the i&s;&s;ue, fly thy country; get thee away, though never &s;o far, rather than deny the Lord of Life.</HI></P>
<P>Now was <HI>Spira</HI> in rea&s;onable quiet, being re&s;olved to yield to the&s;e weighty rea&s;ons; yet holding it wi&s;dom to examine all things, he con&s;ults al&s;o with fle&s;h and blood; thus the battle doth renew, and the fle&s;h begins in this manner:</P>
<P><Q>Be well advi&s;ed, fond man, con&s;ider rea&s;ons on both &s;ides, and then judge; how can&s;t thou thus overween thine own &s;ufficiency, as thou neither regarde&s;t the ex|amples of thy progenitors; nor the judgments of the whole Church; do&s;t thou not con&s;ider what mi&s;ery this thy ra&s;hne&s;s will bring thee unto? thou &s;hall lo&s;e all thy &s;ub&s;tance, gotten with &s;o much care and travel, thou &s;halt undergo the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments that ma|lice it&s;elf can devi&s;e, thou &s;halt be counted an heretick of all: and to clo&s;e up all thou &s;halt die &s;hamefully. What thinke&s;t thou of the loath&s;ome &s;tinking dungeon, of the bloody ax, the burning fagot, are they delight|ful? Be wi&s;e at length, and keep thy life and honour; thou may&s;t live to do much good to good men, as God commands thee, thou may&s;t be an ornament to thy country: and put the ca&s;e thy country's lo&s;s will be of &s;mall e&s;teem with the, Wilt thou bring thy friends al&s;o into danger? thou ha&s;t begotten children, will thou now cut their throats, and inhumanly butcher them, which may in time bring honour to their country, glory to God, help and furtherance to his Church? go to the legate, weak man, freely confe&s;s thy fault and help all the&s;e mi&s;eries.</Q> Thus did the cares of this world, and the deceitfulne&s;s of riches, choak the good &s;eed that was
<PB N="11" REF="009059_0010_10306B20C272B580">
was formerly &s;own; &s;o as fearing, he faints, and yields to the allurements of this pre&s;ent world, and being thus blinded he goes to the legate at <HI>Venice,</HI> and &s;alutes him with this news.</P>
<P><Q>Having for the&s;e divers years entertained an opinion concerning &s;ome articles of faith, contrary to the or|thodox and received judgment of the church; and ut|tered many things again&s;t the authority of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the univer&s;al Bi&s;hop, I humbly acknow|ledge my fault, and error, and my folly in mi&s;leading others: I therefore yield my&s;elf in all obedience to the &s;upream bi&s;hop, into the bo&s;om of the church of <HI>Rome;</HI> never to depart again from the traditions and decrees of the holy See; I am heartily &s;orry for what is pa&s;t; and I humbly beg pardon for &s;o great an offence.</Q></P>
<P>The legate perceiving <HI>Spira</HI> to faint, he pur&s;ues him to the utmo&s;t; he cau&s;eth a recitation of all his errors to be drawn in writing, together with the confe&s;&s;ion annexed to it, and commands <HI>Spira</HI> to &s;ub&s;cribe his name there, which accordingly he did; then the legate commands him to return to his own town; and there to declare this con|fe&s;&s;ion of his, and to acknowledge the whole doctrine of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to be holy, and true; and to abjure the opinions of <HI>Luther,</HI> and other &s;uch teachers, as fal&s;e and heretical: <HI>Man knows the beginning of &s;in, but who bounds the i&s;&s;ues thereof? Spira</HI> having once lo&s;t footing, goes down amain, he cannot &s;tay, nor gain-&s;ay the legate; but promi&s;eth to accompli&s;h his whole will and plea&s;ure; he &s;oon addre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf for his journey, and being on|ward in the way, bethinks him&s;elf of large &s;poils he had brought away from the conflict with the legate; what glorious te&s;timony he had given of his great faith, and con&s;tancy in Chri&s;t's cau&s;e: and to be plain, how impi|ou&s;ly he had denied Chri&s;t, and his go&s;pel at <HI>Venice;</HI> and what he promi&s;ed to do further in his own country; and thus partly with fear, and partly with &s;hame, being con|founded; he thought he heard a voice &s;peaking unto him in this manner:</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="009059_0011_10306B22845AB730"><Q><HI>Spira,</HI> What do&s;t thou here? whither goe&s;t thou? ha&s;t thou unhappy man, given thy hand-writing to the legate at <HI>Venice;</HI> yet &s;ee thou do&s;t not &s;eal it in thine own country: do&s;t thou indeed think eternal life &s;o mean, as that thou preferre&s;t this pre&s;ent life before it? do&s;t thou well in preferring wife and children before Chri&s;t? is the windy applau&s;e of the people, better in|deed than the glory of God: and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this world's good more dear to thee, than the &s;alvation of thine own &s;oul? is the &s;mall u&s;e of a moment of time more de&s;irable, than eternal wrath is dreadful? Think with thy&s;elf what Chri&s;t endured for thy &s;ake; is it not equal that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;uffer &s;omewhat for him? Re|member, man, that the &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent life, are not comparable to the glory that &s;hall be revealed: if thou &s;uffere&s;t with him, thou &s;halt al&s;o reign with him: thou can&s;t not an&s;wer for what thou ha&s;t already done; neverthele&s;s, the gate of mercy is not quite &s;hut, take heed that thou heape&s;t not &s;in upon &s;in, lea&s;t thou repent when it will be too late.</Q></P>
<P>Now was <HI>Spira</HI> in a wilderne&s;s of doubts, not knowing which way to turn him, nor what to do, yet being arrived in his own country, and among&s;t his friends, with &s;hame enough he relates what he had done, and what he had further promi&s;ed to do; and now the terrors of God on the one &s;ide, and the terrors of this world on the other &s;ide, did continually rack him; and therefore he de&s;ired of them advice in this &s;o doubtful a ca&s;e; his friends up|on &s;mall deliberation an&s;wered; that it was requi&s;ite he &s;hould take heed that he did not in any wi&s;e betray his wife and children, and all his friends into danger, &s;eeing that by &s;o &s;mall a matter as the reciting of a little &s;chedule, which might be done in le&s;s &s;pace than half an hour, he might both free him&s;elf from pre&s;ent danger, and pre&s;erve many that depended upon him; adding moreover, that he could get no credit in relenting from that which he had already in greate&s;t part performed before the legate at <HI>Ve|nice,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="009059_0012_10306B24427BFC80">

<P>This was the la&s;t blow of the battle, and <HI>Spira</HI> utterly overcome, goes to the <HI>Praetor,</HI> and proffers to perform his 'fore&s;aid promi&s;e made to the legate, who in the mean time had taken order to have all things ready, and had &s;ent the in&s;trument of abjuration &s;igned by <HI>Spira,</HI> to the <HI>Praetor,</HI> by the hands of a certain prie&s;t. All that night the mi&s;erable man wears out with re&s;tle&s;s cares, without any minute of re&s;t; the next morning being come, he gets up, and being ready, he de&s;perately enters into the public congregation, where ma&s;s being fini&s;hed, in the pre&s;ence of friends and enemies, and of the whole a&s;&s;em|bly; being by e&s;timation near two thou&s;and people; yea, and of heaven it&s;elf, he recites that infamous abjuration, word for word, as it was written: it being done, he was fined at thirty pieces of gold, which he pre&s;ently paid: five whereof were given to the prie&s;t that brought the abjuration, the other twenty-five were employed towards the making of a <HI>&s;hrine</HI> to put the <HI>euchari&s;t</HI> in; then was he &s;ent home re&s;tored to his dignities; goods, wife and children: No &s;ooner was he departed, but he thought he heard a direful voice, &s;aying to him; <HI>Thou wicked wretch, thou ha&s;t denied me, thou ha&s;t renounced the Covenant of thy Obedience, thou ha&s;t broken thy vow; hence Apo&s;tate bear with thee the &s;entence of thy eternal damnation:</HI> he trem|bling and quaking in body and mind, fell down in a &s;woon; relief was at hand for the body, but from that time for|wards

he never found any peace or ea&s;e of his mind; but continuing in ince&s;&s;ant torments, he profe&s;&s;ed that he was captivated under the revenging hand of the great God: that he heard continually that fearful &s;entence of Chri&s;t, that ju&s;t Judge: that he knew he was utterly undone: that he could neither hope for grace, nor Chri&s;t's inter|ce&s;&s;ion with God the Father in his behalf, thus was his fault ever heavy in his heart, and ever his judgment before his eyes.</P>
<P>Now began his friends &s;ome of them to repent too late of his ra&s;h coun&s;el; others not looking &s;o high as the judgment of God, laid all the blame upon his melancho|lic con&s;titution; that over&s;hadowed his judgment, wrought in him a kind of madne&s;s: every one cen&s;ured as his fan|cy led him, yet for remedy all agreed in this, to u&s;e both the whole&s;ome help of phy&s;icians, and the pious advice of divines, and therefore thought it meet to convey him to <HI>Padua,</HI> an univer&s;ity of note, where plenty of all manner of means was to be had: this they accordingly did, both with his wife, children, and whole family; others al&s;o of his friends accompanied him: and being arrived at the hou&s;e of one <HI>James Ardin,</HI> in St. <HI>Leonard</HI>'s pari&s;h, they &s;ent for three phy&s;icians of mo&s;t note, who upon due ob|&s;ervation of the effects, and of other &s;ymptoms of his di&s;|ea&s;e, and &s;ome private conference one with another, among them&s;elves, returned their verdict in this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> That they could not di&s;cern that his body was afflict|ed with any danger or di&s;temper originally from it&s;elf, by rea&s;on of the over-ruling of any humour; but that this malady of his did ari&s;e from &s;ome grief, or pa&s;&s;ion of his mind, which being overburdened, did &s;o oppre&s;s the &s;pi|rits, as they wanting free pa&s;&s;age, &s;tirred up many ill hu|mours whereof the body of man is full; and the&s;e a&s;cend|ing up into the brain, troubled the fancy, &s;hadowed the

&s;eat of the judgment, and &s;o corrupted it: this was the &s;tate of his di&s;ea&s;e, and that outward part that was vi&s;ible to the eye of nature, this they endeavoured to reform by purgation, either to con&s;ume, or at lea&s;t to divert the cour&s;e of the&s;e humours from the brain; but all their &s;kill effect|ed nothing, upon which <HI>Spira</HI> &s;aid: <Q>Alas poor men how far wide are you; do you think that this di&s;ea&s;e is to be cured by potions? believe me there mu&s;t be another manner of medicine, it is neither potions, plai&s;ters, nor druggs, that can help a fainting &s;oul ca&s;t down with &s;en&s;e of &s;in and the wrath of God; it is only Chri&s;t that mu&s;t be the phy&s;ician, and the Go&s;pel the &s;ole antidote.</Q></P>
<P>The phy&s;icians ea&s;ily believed him after they had un|der&s;tood the whole truth of the matter, and therefore they wi&s;hed him to &s;eek &s;ome &s;piritual comfort. By this time the fame of this man was &s;pread over all <HI>Padua,</HI> and the neighbouring country, partly for that he was a man of e&s;|teem, partly becau&s;e as the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o the occa&s;ion was e&s;pecially remarkable; for this was not done in a corner: &s;o as daily there came multitudes of all &s;orts to &s;ee him: &s;ome out of curio&s;ity only to &s;ee and di&s;cour&s;e; &s;ome out of a pious de&s;ire to try all means that might reduce him to comfort again; or at lea&s;t to benefit them&s;elves by &s;uch a &s;pectacle of mi&s;ery, and of the ju&s;tice of God.

They find him now about fifty years of age, neither affected with the dotage of old age, nor with the uncon&s;tant head-&s;trong pa&s;&s;ion of youth, but in the &s;trength of his experience and judgment; in a burning heat, calling exce&s;&s;ively for drink; yet his under&s;tanding active, quick of apprehen&s;ion, witty in di&s;cour&s;e, above his ordinary manner, and judiciou&s;ly

oppo&s;ite; his friends laboured him by all fair means to receive &s;ome nouri&s;hment, which he ob&s;tinately gain-&s;ay|ing, they forcibly infu&s;ed &s;ome liquid &s;u&s;tenance into his mouth, mo&s;t of which he &s;pit out again; exceedingly chaf|fing, and in this fretting mood of his; As it is true, <Q>that all things work for the be&s;t to tho&s;e that love God,</Q> &s;o to the wicked all are contrary; <Q>for whereas a plentiful off-&s;pring is the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and his reward being a &s;tay to the weak e&s;tate of their aged parents, to me they are a cau&s;e of bitterne&s;s and vexation; they do &s;trive to make me tire out this mi&s;ery: I would fain be at an end, I de&s;erve not this dealing at their hands; Oh! that I were gone from hence, that &s;ome-body would let out this weary &s;oul.</Q></P>
<P>His friends &s;aluted him, and asked him, what he con|ceived to be the cau&s;e of his di&s;ea&s;e; forthwith he brake out into a lamentable di&s;cour&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ages formerly related, and that with &s;uch pa&s;&s;ionate elocution, that he cau&s;ed many to weep, and mo&s;t to tremble. They con|trarily to comfort him propounded many of God's pro|mi&s;es recorded in the &s;cripture, and many examples of God's mercy: <HI>My &s;in</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>is greater than the mercy of God.</HI> Nay, an&s;wered they, the mercy of God is above all &s;in: God would have all men to be &s;aved: <Q>It is true <HI>(quoth he)</HI> he would have all that he hath elected to be &s;aved; he would not have damned reprobates to be &s;aved: I am one of that number; I know it, for I willingly and again&s;t my knowledge denied Chri&s;t, and I feel that He hardens, and will not &s;uffer me to hope.</Q></P>
<P>After &s;ome &s;ilence, one a&s;ked him whether he did not believe that doctrine to be true, for which he was accu&s;ed before the legate? he an&s;wered; <Q>I did believe it when I denied it, but now I neither believe that, nor the doctrine of the Romi&s;h Church; I believe nothing, I

have no faith, no tru&s;t, no hope: I am a reprobate like <HI>Cain</HI> or <HI>Judas</HI> who ca&s;ting away all hope of mercy fell into de&s;pair, and my friends do me great wrong, that they &s;uffer me not to go to the place of unbelievers, as I ju&s;tly de&s;erve.</Q></P>
<P>Here they began &s;harply to rebuke him; requiring, and charging him that in any ways he did not violate the mer|cy of God, to which he an&s;wered; <Q>The mercy of God is exceeding large, and extends to all the elect, but not to me, or any like to me, who are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ed up to wrath, I tell you I de&s;erve it, my own con&s;cience condemns me: what needeth any other judge?</Q> Chri&s;t came (&s;aid they) to take away &s;in, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 14. and calling for a book, they read unto him the pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and coming to his nailing to the Cro&s;s, <HI>Spira</HI> &s;aid, <Q>This in|deed is comfortable to &s;uch as are elected, but as for me wretch, they are nothing but grief and torment be|cau&s;e I contemned them.</Q> Thus roaring for grief, and to&s;&s;ing him&s;elf up and down upon the bed as he lay, he entreated them to read no more.

life? Is the Lord's hand now &s;hortened, that it cannot &s;ave?

<P>Then roaring out in the bitterne&s;s of his &s;pirit, &s;aid, <Q>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God:</Q> the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion and action &s;uitable, did amaze many of the beholders; in&s;omuch as &s;ome of them &s;aid with a whi&s;pering voice, that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; he over-hearing it, &s;aid, <Q>Do ye doubt it? I have a whole legion of devils that take up their dwelling within me and po&s;&s;e&s;s me as their own, and ju&s;tly too, for I have denied Chri&s;t.</Q> We would a&s;k whether you did that willingly or not? (&s;aid they) <Q>That's nothing to the purpo&s;e (&s;aid <HI>Spira</HI>) Chri&s;t &s;aith, Who&s;oever de|nies me before men, him will I deny before my Father which is in heaven.

<P>They ob&s;erving his di&s;temper to ari&s;e from the &s;en&s;e and horror of the pains of hell, a&s;ked whether he thought there were wor&s;e pain than what he endured for the pre|&s;ent, he &s;aid, <Q>that he knew there were far wor&s;e pains than tho&s;e that he then &s;uffered, for the wicked &s;hall ri&s;e to their judgment, but they &s;hall not &s;tand in judg|ment; <HI>P&s;al.</HI> i.

<P><PB N="19" REF="009059_0018_10306B3745201688">Aye, but you are to con&s;ider (&s;aid one) that tho&s;e opi|nions for which you are accu&s;ed before the legate, were impious, and therefore you are not to think you denied Chri&s;t, but rather that you confe&s;&s;ed him, acknowledging the infallible truth of the Catholic Church.

Now having &s;inned again&s;t the holy Gho&s;t, God hath taken away from me all power of repentance, and brings all my &s;ins to remembrance, and guilty of one, guilty of all. And therefore it is no matter whether my &s;ins be great or &s;mall, few or many: They be &s;uch as that nei|ther Chri&s;t's blood, nor God's mercy belongs to me.

God will have mercy on whom he will have mercy; and whom he will he hardeneth: This is it that gnaws my heart, he hath hardned me, and I find that he daily more and more doth harden me, and therefore I am out of hope: I feel it, therefore cannot but de&s;pair. I tell you there never was &s;uch a mon&s;ter as I am, never was any man alive a &s;pectacle of exceeding mi&s;ery. I knew that ju&s;tification is to be expected by Chri&s;t, and I denied and abjured it, to the end I might keep this frail life from adver&s;ity, and my children from poverty; and now behold how bitter this life is to me, and God only knows what &s;hall become of this my family; but &s;ure no good is likely to betide it, but wor&s;e and wor&s;e: and &s;uch a ruin at length as one &s;tone &s;hall not be left up|on another.</Q> But why &s;hould you &s;aid <HI>Gribauldus</HI> con|ceit &s;o deeply of your &s;in, &s;eeing you cannot but know that many have denyed Chri&s;t, yet never fell into de&s;pair: <Q>Well &s;aid he, I can &s;ee no ground of comfort for &s;uch, neither can I warrant them from Gods revenging hand in wrath; though it plea&s;eth God yet to &s;uffer &s;uch to be in peace; and be&s;ides, there will a time of danger come, and then they &s;hall be throughly tryed, and if it were not &s;o, yet God is ju&s;t in making me an example to others: And I cannot ju&s;tly complain, there is no puni&s;hment &s;o great but I have de&s;erved it, for this &s;o heinous offence: I a&s;|&s;ure you it is no &s;mall matter to deny Chri&s;t, and yet it is more ordinary then commonly men do conceive of; it is not a denial made before a Magi&s;trate, as it is with me, for as often as a Chri&s;tian doth di&s;&s;emble the known truth; as often as he approves of fal&s;e wor&s;hip by pre|&s;enting him&s;elf at it, &s;o often as he hath not things wor|thy of his calling, or &s;uch things as are unworthy of his calling, &s;o often he denies Chri&s;t; thus did I, and there|fore am ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for it.</Q> Your e&s;tate (quoth

<P>They perceiving &s;mall effect of all this their labour; but rather that he grew wor&s;e; for the avoiding of con|cour&s;e of people (for every day &s;eldom fewer than 20 con|tinued with him) and to &s;top the cour&s;e of fame which was continually blown abroad of him, they con&s;ult to car|ry him back again into his own country: and tho&s;e his friends that came to comfort him, began to take their leaves of him: <HI>Vergerius</HI> among the re&s;t required that at their parting they might pray together with him: <HI>Spira</HI> hardly con&s;ented, and as unwillingly performed: for he &s;aid, <Q>My heart is e&s;tranged from God, I cannot call him Father, from my heart; all good motions are now quite gone, my heart is full of malediction, hatred, and bla&s;phemy again&s;t God; I find I grow more and more hardened in heart, and cannot &s;toop and help my&s;elf; your prayers for me &s;hall turn to your own benefit, they can do me no good.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Vergerius</HI> came to take his leave of him, whom <HI>Spira</HI> embracing, &s;aid, <Q>Although I know that nothing can bring any benefit to me a reprobate, but that every thing &s;hall tend to my deeper condemnation; yet I give you
<PB N="36" REF="009059_0035_10306B6399844D88">
mo&s;t hearty thanks for your kind office of love and good will; and the Lord return it to you with a plentiful increa&s;e to all good.</Q></P>
<P>The next day being brought down to his intended jour|ney, by the way looking round about him with a gha&s;tly look, he &s;aw a knife lying on a table, to which he running ha&s;tily &s;natched hold of, as intending to mi&s;chief him&s;elf, but his friends laying hold of him, &s;topped him in his pur|po&s;e: whereupon with indignation he &s;aid, <Q>I would I were above God, for I know he will have no mercy on me!</Q></P>
<P>Thus went he homewards, often &s;aying, that he envi|ed the condition of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Judas.</HI> He lay about eight weeks in this ca&s;e in a continual burning, neither de&s;iring nor receiving any thing but by force, and that without di|ge&s;tion, was &s;o &s;pent that he appear'd a perfect anatomy, expre&s;&s;ing to view nothing but &s;inews and bones; vehe|mently raged for drink; ever pining, yet fearful to live long; dreaded hell, yet coveting death in a continual tor|ment, yet his own tormentor: and thus con&s;uming him|&s;elf with grief and horror, impatience and de&s;pair, like a living man in hell; he repre&s;ented an extraordinary ex|ample of the ju&s;tice and power of God: and thus (as far as appeareth) within a few days after his arrival at his own home, he departed this pre&s;ent life. Yet an occa|&s;ion to make us remember that &s;ecret things belong unto the Lord our God; but charity to man, to teach him to hope all things.</P>
