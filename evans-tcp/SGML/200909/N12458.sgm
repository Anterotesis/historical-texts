<HEAD>Serious Reflections affectionately recommended to the Well-di&s;po&s;ed of every Religious De|nomination, particularly tho&s;e who Mourn and Lament on account of the Calamities which attend us; and the in&s;en&s;ibility that &s;o generally prevails.</HEAD>
<P>IF People had never &s;een War kindled in a Country and between neighbouring Nations, they could hardly believe that men would be &s;o inattentive to the dictates of Rea&s;on, the tender feelings of humanity and the more &s;ublime nature and precepts of the Go&s;pel,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> v. 44.

That loaded as men are with their own frailties and mi&s;eries, they &s;hould indu&s;triou&s;ly labour to encrea&s;e them and contrive new ways for the ruin and &s;laughter one of another.

It is now &s;everal years &s;ince the hand of God has been lifted up in Judgment; great di&s;tre&s;s and &s;ufferings have and &s;till do attend us; multitudes of our Fellow-men have been hurried into eternity, and yet the People do not appear humbled nor careful to inquire into the true cau&s;e. Sinners are cha&s;ti&s;ed, and yet remain uncon|verted. Let us look no where el&s;e but in our&s;elves for the cau&s;e of our mi&s;eries; our Sins are our greate&s;t Enemies and draw upon us all the re&s;t.

Ble&s;&s;ed are the Peace-makers; for they &s;hall be called the Children of God.</NOTE> but let all &s;incerely ad|dre&s;s our common Father for ability to pray, not for the de&s;truction of our Enemies, who are &s;till our Brethren, the Purcha&s;e of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer's blood; but for an agree|ment with them. Not in order to indulge our pa&s;&s;ions in the Gain and Delights of this vain World, and forget that we are called to be as Pilgrims and Strangers in it; but that we may be more compo&s;ed and better fitted for the kingdom of God; that in the di&s;pen|&s;ations of his good plea&s;ure he may grant us &s;uch a Peace, as may prove to the con&s;olation of the Church, as well as the Nation, and be on earth an image of the tranquillity of Heaven.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Our Saviour enjoins us to pray to our Father, <HI>Mat</HI> vi. 10.

<P>AN eminent &s;ervant of GOD, who had known deliverance from the dark powers, and experimentally felt the powers of the world to come, a few hours before his death, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the following words: <Q>There is a &s;pirit which I feel, that delights to do no evil, nor to revenge any wrong, but delights to endure all things, in hopes to enjoy its own in the end; its hope is to outlive all wrath and contention, and to weary out all exaltation and cruelty or what&s;oever is of a nature contrary to it|&s;elf; it &s;ees to the end of all temptations; as it bears no evil it&s;elf, &s;o it conceives none in thought to any other; for its ground and &s;pring is the mercies and for|givene&s;s of God; its crown is meekne&s;s; its life is everla&s;ting love unfeigned, and takes its kingdom with intreaty, and not with contention, and keeps it by lowline&s;s of mind; in God alone it can rejoice, though none el&s;e regard it, or can own its life; 'tis conceived in &s;orrow, and brought forth without any to pity it, nor doth it murmur at grief and oppre&s;&s;ion; it never rejoiceth but through &s;ufferings, for with the world's joy it is murdered.
