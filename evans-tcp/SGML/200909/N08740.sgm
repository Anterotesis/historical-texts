<HEAD>A DIALOGUE Between a MINISTER and his PARISHIONER.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pari&s;hioner.</HI> SIR,</SPEAKER>
<P>ENCOURAGED by the kind reception I met with in my fir&s;t vi&s;it, I am come to make you a &s;econd. For I &s;till have a &s;trong de&s;ire that my child &s;hould be baptized, and I have &s;omething new to offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am ready to baptize your child with all my heart, as &s;oon as you will put me in a way to do it on principles con&s;i&s;tent with the bible, and with them&s;elves. <HI>Have you yet found any text of &s;cripture that will warrant the half-way-practice?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been round the country &s;ince I &s;aw you, and my ears have been open to all the talk: Particularly, I have had a long conver&s;ation with my former mini&s;ter, the &s;ub&s;tance of which has been printed at <HI>Hartford,</HI> under the title of <HI>a &s;econd dialogue between a mini&s;ter and his pari&s;hioner, concerning the half way-covenant;</HI> which, I &s;uppo&s;e, you have &s;een. And now according to the words he has put into my mouth, and according to all I have heard about the country among my friends, I am come to &s;peak at this time. Therefore I &s;ay,&mdash;as to a text of &s;cripture&mdash;"allow there is none," not one text of &s;cripture to ju&s;tify the half-way-practice, "it don't in the lea&s;t prove the point."&mdash;Pray, where is there one to condemn it? p. 3.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In this controver&s;y gentlemen on your &s;ide of the que&s;tion are wont to argue abundantly from the old te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation. Did you never ob&s;erve, that according to the expre&s;s letter of the Jewi&s;h law, if any man was found guilty of the half way-practice, he was to be excommunicated?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I never did.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to take the bible, and turn to <HI>Num.</HI> 9.13. The text I referred you to when here before, and read it in this view.</P>

<P>The words are&mdash;<HI>But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the pa&s;&s;over; even the &s;ame &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from his people, becau&s;e he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed &s;ea&s;on: that man &s;hall bear his &s;in.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Read the foregoing, 10, 11, ver&s;es, and you will &s;ee, that tho&s;e who were hindred by uncleanne&s;s, or a journey, from attending the pa&s;&s;over in its &s;ea&s;on, were obliged to keep it the very next month; whereas it is the cu&s;tom in &s;ome of our churches, to allow per&s;ons to own the covenant, and have their children baptized, and live and die, and never come to the Lord's table. Among the Jews &s;uch men would have been excommunicated.&mdash; And be&s;ides, are not the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t obliged by their commi&s;&s;ion, Mar. 28. to teach the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t to ob&s;erve <HI>all things</HI> which he has com|manded? And has he not expre&s;ly commanded all his di&s;ciples, &s;ay|ing, <HI>This do in remembrance of me?</HI> Luk. 22. And are we not all agreed that the <HI>&s;econd command requires us to keep pure and entire all &s;uch religious wor|&s;hip and ordinances as God hath appointed in his word?</HI> And have mini&s;ters or churches a di&s;pen&s;ing power? Are they authorized by Chri&s;t to grant indul|gence to any of his di&s;ciples to live in the allowed breach of any one of his laws? Mat. 5.19. The pope claims this power; but all prote&s;tants are agreed in di&s;claiming it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>"I cannot believe the command of Chri&s;t obligeth any of his followers to do that which they in their con&s;ciences dare not attempt."&mdash;"To oblige per&s;ons to that, which they are not convinced they may &s;afely do, is hard." &mdash;"I freely allow it is the duty of all to come."&mdash;"I believe it is my duty to come, but I believe I mu&s;t fir&s;t get my &s;cruples removed." p. 4 5.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are your &s;cruples? my dear &s;ir. Let me know them, and will do my be&s;t to remove them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not becau&s;e I think I ought to be converted before I come to the Lord's table. This was my only &s;cruple once. But I give it up. My for|mer mini&s;ter has convinced me, that the &s;cheme I was in cannot be vindicated He tells me, I have as good a right to come to the Lord's Table, knowing my&s;elf to be unconverted, as to attend the common means of grace, p. 8 and I am now convinced; but yet I dare not in con&s;cience come. p. 5.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, you believe you have an undoubted right to come, and yet you doubt whether you may come. You believe it is your duty to come, but yet you dare not in con&s;cience come. Your con&s;cience &s;ays, yes, and no, at the &s;ame time. A &s;trange con&s;cience this! I thought you hone&s;t in your fir&s;t vi&s;it, but what &s;hall I think now? to believe a thing to be, and not to be, at the &s;ame time, is to believe a contradiction &mdash;Pray be not offended, my dear &s;ir, at my pointing out the incon&s;i&s;tence of your pre&s;ent &s;cheme; rather re+view it with that candor that becomes an hone&s;t man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>My former mini&s;ter tells me, that the half-way practice has been ap+proved of and practi&s;ed upon by many great and good men, p. 4, 14, 15.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps he did not mean to be under&s;tood, that they approved of <HI>his</HI> half-way-practice; for he knew, that <HI>this &s;cheme of his,</HI> to which you are become a pro&s;elyte, was not the &s;cheme upon which they profe&s;&s;ed to act This &s;cheme is e&s;&s;entially different from the half-way-&s;cheme of the &s;ynod in
<PB N="4" REF="011173_0004_0F857FD42479EBD0">
Bo&s;ton, 1662; for they&mdash;<Q>did acknowledge, that there ought to be true &s;aving faith in the parent, according to the judgment of rational charity, or el&s;e the child ought not to be baptized.</Q>&mdash;This I told you before; and did your former mini&s;ter deny this to be the &s;ynod's &s;cheme?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did not. But he however really thinks in his con&s;cience their &s;cheme is wrong; (yea, that it amounts to the &s;ame thing with Sandemeani&s;m, p. 5.) for he believes, that a man may enter into covenant with God; and have his child baptized, and come to the Lord's table too, who knows him|&s;elf to be unconverted, p. 8&mdash;12.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your former mini&s;ter then knows, that the famous men, whom he mentions, are not in his &s;cheme. Why then did he mention them in a man|ner which tended to lead you to think they were? I &s;uppo&s;e he al&s;o knew, that there is no evidence that the half-way-practice was &s;et up in New-England, till after the &s;ynod, 1662, 40 years after the fir&s;t &s;ettling of the country. Mr. Prudden in his letter dated, 1651, to which he refers, &s;ays, "it is a thing I do not yet hear practi&s;ed." And not one of the letters in my collection, &s;ay, that it was practi&s;ed. But be this as it may, it is nothing to your purpo&s;e, for you reject their &s;cheme, and advance one of another nature, on different and contrary principles; even on principles on which the half-way-practice never was ju&s;tified before by any &s;ynod, council, pre&s;|bytery, or any one &s;ingle writer, perhaps, &s;ince the world began. A &s;cheme which no pari&s;hioner can be in, and act upon, without being guilty of the mo&s;t glaring &s;elf-contradiction. A &s;cheme, therefore, I am of opinion, no pari&s;hioner ever was in, and acted upon, that under&s;tood him&s;elf. For, if men believe they have equal right to both ordinances, there is no room left for &s;cruples. There is no room for the half-way-practice, upon their own principles, according to their own con&s;cience. The &s;ynod in 1662, knew better than to advance &s;uch a &s;cheme as this.</P>
<P>The &s;um of the matter is this, when you owned your covenant, you did not mean to own the covenant of grace, which you thought none but the godly might do; but the half-way-covenant, which you thought the uncon|verted might do; your former mini&s;ter, in the time of it, thought the princi|ples you acted upon were wrong; but, for peace &s;ake, &s;uffered you to take your cour&s;e, and this confirmed you in your error.&mdash;Now he tells you plainly, "there is no half-way-covenant;" and he that is qualified to have his chil|dren baptized is equally qualified for the Lord's table.&mdash;You are convinced &mdash;you give up the half-way-covenant; and to be con&s;i&s;tent, you mu&s;t now give up the half-way-practice too. For, according to your own con&s;cience, you are now as fit for one ordinance as for the other; and to &s;ay you dare not come, is expre&s;ly to contradict your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if I had been con&s;cience bound? And what if no one could have convinced me? In &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, &s;urely it would be the duty of a mini&s;ter to bear with one.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what if you was about to &s;ign a bond of &pound;. 1000 to a merchant for a pearl of great price? And what if you thought it to be &pound;. 1000 old tenor? A good bargain, think you. And what if in this view you was greatly engaged to &s;trike the bargain? Con&s;cience bound! and was &s;o bad a reader, as not to ob&s;erve it was plainly written &pound;. 1000 &s;terling.&mdash;Now, nothing can open your eyes, and hinder your &s;igning the bond, and binding your&s;elf to ten times as much as you are worth in the world, or would be willing to give; but the plain truth&mdash;the merchant fees your mi&s;take&mdash;&s;hall he tell you the truth, wake you up from the plea&s;ing dream, or let you go on in your error?&mdash;the an&s;wer is ea&s;y.&mdash;Oh, how many poor &s;ouls are there, who know not what they are about, when they own the covenant!&mdash;Pray, my dear &s;ir, how do you under&s;tand the covenant of grace, and covenanting tran&s;actions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am told, that the covenant of grace requires real holine&s;s, even re|pentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: And yet that men, who know they have no grace, may enter into this covenant with a good con&s;cience, without being guilty of lying. p. 8, 9.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you with a good con&s;cience profe&s;s that to be true, which you know, in the time of it, is not true?</P>
<P>This is thought to be lying in our dealing between man and man; and why not in our tran&s;actions with the heart-&s;earching God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The I&s;raelites entered into covenant at Mount Sinai, but they were generally gracele&s;s. p. 6.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you not remember the high charge which God afterwards exhibited again&s;t them by the divinely in&s;pired p&s;almi&s;t. <HI>They did flatter him with their lips, and they lied unto him with their tongues, for their heart was not right with him, neither were they &s;teadfa&s;t in his covenant.</HI> P&s;. 78, 36, 37. And do you not remember that the carca&s;es of this wicked hypocritical gene|ration fell in the wilderne&s;s? And do you not know, that the&s;e things were written for our warning that we might not &s;in and peri&s;h, as they did; and not for our imitation? And if they are thus charged by God with lying, for profe&s;&s;ing that to be true which was not &s;o, altho' in the time of it, for aught appears, they thought it was; how will God look upon you, if you profe&s;s that, which, in the time of it, you know to be fal&s;e? Can wilful lying be called an in&s;tituting means of grace, which is &s;o plainly contrary to the light of nature? Can this be preached up as a means of conver&s;ion, which natu|rally tends to harden men in &s;in? A&s;k the wi&s;e&s;t man that ever lived under that di&s;pen&s;ation, and he will tell you, <HI>Better is it that thou &s;hould&s;t not vow, than that thou &s;hould&s;t vow and not pay.</HI> Eccl. 5.5.&mdash;And if that people acted hypocritically in the time of <HI>A&s;a,</HI> as is intimated p. 9. whether ju&s;tly or not, we need not &s;tand to enquire, for if they did, they mu&s;t fall under the &s;ame condemnation with their forefathers: And their wicked example is not to be your pattern, but the law of God is your only rule.</P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mean to profe&s;s, that I have true repentance, or &s;aving faith, or any holine&s;s in my heart, or any thing that implies it. This is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to &s;ealing ordinances. p. 8&mdash;12.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the covenant then with which you mean to profe&s;s a com|pliance?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not any half-way-covenant, for&mdash;"there is no half-way-covenant," p. 4.&mdash;"no one di&s;putes it being the covenant of grace."&mdash;"no one dare deny it." p. 6.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then! does your former mini&s;ter in&s;truct you thus? Does he teach you, in words, to profe&s;s a compliance with the covenant of grace, and at the &s;ame time to mean in your heart, that you do not comply with it? Does he teach you to &s;ub&s;titute &s;uch gro&s;s di&s;&s;imulation in the room of &s;o holy a tran&s;action as entering into covenant with the GREAT GOD! And does he learn you to ju&s;tify your conduct by the hypocritical profe&s;&s;ions of that generation who&s;e carca&s;es fell in the wilderne&s;s!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, &s;ir, by no means. I do not believe a profe&s;&s;ion of a compliance with the covenant of grace is nece&s;&s;ary in order to &s;ealing ordinances. This was not required of the I&s;raelites by Mo&s;es, nor of the Jews by John bapti&s;t, or by Chri&s;t, or his apo&s;tles. p. 8&mdash;12.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then! We are to profe&s;s a compliance with no covenant at all, it &s;eems! Not with the half-way-covenant; for there is none.&mdash;Not with the covenant of grace; for this never was required.&mdash;And there is no other covenant.&mdash;It therefore follows, according to you, that we are to enter into covenant with God vi&s;ibly, without profe&s;&s;ing to comply with any co|venant at all, what &s;ay you to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard that it hath been &s;aid, that a man who knows he has no grace, may profe&s;s to comply with the covenant of grace, with moral &s;in|cerity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why might not Annanias and Sapphira be &s;uppo&s;ed to exerci&s;e moral &s;incerity in their profe&s;&s;ion, as well, when they brought their money, and laid it at the apo&s;tle's feet, and &s;aid, <HI>this is all;</HI> altho' they knew what they &s;aid was not true? For, if we profe&s;s &s;upreme love to God and Chri&s;t, &amp;c. when we know there is none in our hearts, we do &s;ay that which we know is not true, as really as they did. And if we do not profe&s;s &s;upreme love to God and Chri&s;t, &amp;c. we do not profe&s;s a compliance with the cove|nant of grace, and &s;o do not vi&s;ibly enter into covenant with God, and &s;o are not vi&s;ible di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, nor can we claim the peculiar privileges of &s;uch. When therefore your mini&s;ter, &s;peaking of that covenant with God, which profe&s;&s;ors publickly enter into, in our churches, previous to their admi&s;|&s;ion to &s;pecial ordinances, &s;aid, "there is no half-way-covenant"&mdash;"no one di&s;putes it being the covenant of grace"&mdash;"no one dare deny it." He im|plicitly yielded up every point for which we contend. Nor do I doubt, if this controver&s;y &s;hould go on, it will &s;oon publickly appear, that there is
<PB N="7" REF="011173_0007_0F857FD65E408D78">
"one who dare deny it." For, otherwi&s;e all men of &s;en&s;e will &s;ee that gen|tlemen on that &s;ide of the que&s;tion, are gro&s;sly incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I feel my&s;elf pinched. I cannot get out. I mu&s;t therefore deny that it is the covenant of grace, that is to be owned, and by con&s;equence I mu&s;t &s;ay, that a profe&s;&s;ion of a compliance with no covenant at all, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to &s;ealing ordinances. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">To own the covenant, i. e. to own that we are in duty bound to com|ply with the covenant of grace, and at the &s;ame time knowingly not to com|ply with it, notwith&s;tanding all obligations, is not really to enter into cove|nant with God, as in duty we are bound, but really to reject the covenant of God, to reject God and the Redeemer. And to profe&s;s to own the cove|nant in this &s;en&s;e, is not a vi&s;ible entering into covenant with God. Such a profe&s;&s;ion is not a covenanting tran&s;action.</NOTE> For there is no other covenant, but the covenant of grace. But this would condemn the practice of all our churches in a lump.

My de&s;ign was to &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of the half-way-covenant, and the half-way-practice, in u&s;e in our churches.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>John preached up but one kind of repentance&mdash;the repentance which he preached up was a gracious repentance; for it was connected with the remi&s;|&s;ion of &s;ins: tho&s;e who appeared by their profe&s;&s;ion to comply with his preach|ing, even tho&s;e who came to him <HI>confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins,</HI> he baptized; and there|fore his bapti&s;m was called by the name of <HI>the bapti&s;m of repentance for the re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins:</HI> and therefore was evidently the &s;ame with that in Acts 2.38. <HI>Repent and be bapti&s;ed in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> See Mat. 21.28&mdash;32.

<P N="13">13. Doth not bapti&s;m, received in infancy, merely of it &s;elf, give right to bapti&s;m for our children?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>If our bapti&s;m alone gives us a right to have our children bapti&s;ed, then our right continues after we have been cen&s;ured for gro&s;s &s;candal, yea after ex|communication; for even excommunication does not cau&s;e us to be unbapti&s;ed, or render it needful that we &s;hould be bapti&s;ed again, upon repentance; as all grant.</P>

<P N="14">14. Are not all bapti&s;ed infants in the church? and have not all church-members a right to church privileges?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bapti&s;m alone, in the apo&s;tolic age, never made any adult per&s;on, a church-member; or give any one a right to church privileges, without a pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Profe&s;&s;ion was fir&s;t made, and then they were bapti&s;ed. Tho&s;e there|fore that are bapti&s;ed in infancy, in order to be members, in this &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t make a profe&s;&s;ion when they become adult. The New-England churches, therefore, are right in demanding it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Q</SPEAKER>
<P N="15">15. Were not the gracele&s;s I&s;raelites, in fact, in covenant with God? And have not all who are in covenant a right to covenant privileges?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>He who complies with the covenant of grace, in the &s;ight of God, as &s;earcher of hearts, has a right, in the &s;ight of God, as &s;earcher of hearts, to all the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant; and &s;o to the &s;eals. In this &s;en&s;e, the gracele&s;s I&s;raelites were not in covenant; as all allow.&mdash;He who profe&s;&s;eth to comply with the covenant of grace, and promi&s;es to live according to it, is bound by his profe&s;&s;ion and promi&s;e to be holy to God in heart and life; is under covenant bonds and obligations by his own act and deed; and &s;o is in covenant with God in this &s;en&s;e; and that altho' he re|nounces the covenant in his heart by impenitence and unbelief; yea, altho' he renounces the covenant in his life by open &s;candal. And, in this &s;en&s;e, the I&s;raelites were God's covenant people, even when they lived in open idolatry; yea, after they had rejected and crucified the Me&s;&s;iah, Acts 3.25. But being in covenant, in this &s;en&s;e, gives no real right to &s;ealing ordinances; for if it does, then the rejecters and murderers of Chri&s;t had &s;uch a right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P N="16">16. Did not God know that the I&s;raelites at Mount Sinai were gracele&s;s when they entered into covenant? If &s;o, why did he lead them to enter into covenant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the omni&s;cient, heart-&s;earching God, he knew it: but he did not act in this character.&mdash;As vi&s;ible head of that people, in which character he acted he did not know it.

<P>It is not a &s;cripture-phra&s;e&mdash;Divines, who u&s;e it, mean, &s;ome, one thing,
<PB N="10" REF="011173_0010_0F857FDB2EB09F18">
and &s;ome, another.&mdash;Some mean the covenant of grace, externally exhibited by God in his word, and externally complied with in a profe&s;&s;ion of godline&s;s. Others mean a covenant requiring only external obedience, in di&s;tinction from heart-holine&s;s.&mdash;Thus &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e the Sinai covenant required merely ex|ternal obedience&mdash;and was e&s;&s;entially a di&s;tinct and different thing from the covenant of grace&mdash;and &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e the bapti&s;mal covenant not to be the covenant of grace, but a covenant requiring external obedience only.&mdash;I am of opinion the&s;e ungracious covenants are creatures of the imagination, a mere human device, for rea&s;ons I have already hinted at.&mdash;But the practice of allowing &s;ealing ordinances, to tho&s;e who know them&s;elves to be gracele&s;s, can be vindicated only on the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch an ungracious covenant: and indeed, this is the only point that need be &s;ettled, to &s;ettle the whole controver|&s;y; for if a compliance with the covenant of grace mu&s;t be profe&s;&s;ed, tho&s;e who know they have no grace cannot make a profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P N="18">18. The Jews univer&s;ally circumci&s;ed their children, attended the &s;acrifice of the pa&s;&s;over, and all their other &s;acrifices and ordinances, let them be ever &s;o openly and &s;candalou&s;ly wicked, even altho' they lived in idolatry; and why &s;hould we not do &s;o too, in the chri&s;tian world? Why &s;hould not we as univer&s;ally attend &s;acraments, as we do public wor&s;hip on the &s;abbath?</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>God has never told us that <HI>the example of that wicked hypocritical people &s;hould be the rule of our conduct.</HI> This point, you &s;eem to take for granted; but it is not allowed.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q</SPEAKER>
<P N="19">19. But did not God command them to attend all ordinances?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the manner in which they did. For if our Saviour under&s;tood the law of Mo&s;es, all the duties required in it, the Jews were obliged by their law to perform, in a gracious manner. i. e. from love; from love to God and man. For <HI>on the&s;e two hang all the law and the prophets.</HI> Mat. 22.37 &mdash; 40.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P N="20">20. My former mini&s;ter allows that we ought to perform all duties in a right manner. p. 7. But the que&s;tion is this, is it not better to do them in a wrong manner, than not at all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;inners are more likely to be converted, who attend the common means of grace, than tho&s;e who do not: for, <HI>how &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how &s;hall they hear without a preacher?</HI> Rom. 10.14 Neverthele&s;s, as to covenanting tran&s;actions, the words of the wi&s;e man are the truth. Eccl. 5 5. <HI>Better is it that thou &s;hould&s;t not vow, than that thou &s;hould&s;t vow and not pay.</HI> It is better to do nothing than to lie. Lying is not a means of grace&mdash;It is not an appointed means of conver&s;ion. P&s;a. 50.16. <HI>But unto the wicked God &s;aith, what ha&s;t thou to do to declare my &s;tatutes, or that thou &s;hould&s;t take my covenant in thy mouth?</HI> But gracele&s;s men may at|tend common means without lying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P N="21">21. Granting all the&s;e things are &s;o; yet is it not better for us to go on in
<PB N="11" REF="011173_0011_0F857FDBA0511628">
the common way? Some of the good kings of Judah reformed things as far as they could: <HI>Neverthele&s;s the high places were not taken away.</HI> If the half way practice cannot be vindicated from the word of God; yet is it not be&s;t to tole|rate it? "I tremble to think of the awful con&s;equences," of doing otherwi&s;e. p. 13.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>They provoked him to anger with their high places.</HI> P&s;a. 78.58. And &s;hall their God provoking conduct, be the rule for us to walk by?&mdash;Surely no&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<P>In popi&s;h countries they are in&s;tructed to believe, that the laity may take Chri&s;t's body and eat it, but may not drink his blood. And no doubt thou&s;ands of the common people think it a very wicked thing to drink one drop of the &s;acramental wine. They dare come to the altar, as they call it; they dare take and eat Chri&s;t's body; but their con&s;ciences are &s;o tender they dare not ta&s;te the wine. But, pray, whence ari&s;e their &s;cruples? not from the bible. There is not a tittle in the bible that looks that way. They are as expre&s;sly commanded to take the cup and drink it, as to take the bread and eat it So the command to all Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples is equally plain in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, as is granted. Every parent who has a right to bapti&s;m, for his children is expre&s;sly enjoined to attend the Lord's Supper, as is allowed; but if with light and in love we vindicate this, and practice accordingly, "you tremble for the awful con&s;equences."&mdash;The clergy among the papi&s;ts, if they would unite, as one man, might &s;oon rectify the judgments of the com|mon people, and remove all their &s;cruples, and bring on a general reformation without any "awful con&s;equences," in that ca&s;e. So the clergy might in our churches, in this ca&s;e. Both ca&s;es as they &s;tand in the bible are equally plain. And are not the popi&s;h clergy to blame for not teaching their people the truth plainly, all as one man?&mdash;'Tis true, if a few popi&s;h clergy men &s;hould come out boldly, and declare plainly, that the laity have as good a right to one element as to the other, and practice accordingly; they would &s;oon be &s;ilenced, if not &s;omething wor&s;e. But is it therefore lawful and right for them to go on in their half-way-practice, contrary to the divine in&s;titution, to a+void this "awful con&s;equence"? are they not bound to abide by and act agreeable to Chri&s;t's in&s;titution at the ri&s;que of their lives? Luke 14.25&mdash;33.</P>
<P>And now to conclude, what &s;hall we do to avoid "the awful con&s;equences? Shall we give up the covenent of grace, and &s;ub&s;titute in its room a covenant requiring no holine&s;s, nothing but external duties, to &s;uit the ta&s;te of wicked men? Or, if we keep the covenant of grace, &s;hall we tolerate wilful lying in the wor&s;hip of God, by leading tho&s;e, who know them&s;elves to be gracele&s;s, to make a profe&s;&s;ion of a compliance with the covenant of grace, in order to keep peace? Is &s;uch wickedne&s;s as this nece&s;&s;ary to a quiet life? Can it be? Surely no&punc; Our confe&s;&s;ion of faith declares, ch. 28. <HI>Sacraments are holy &s;igns and &s;eals of the covenant of grace.</HI> Chap. 29. <HI>Bapti&s;m is&mdash;a &s;ign and &s;eal of the covenant of grace</HI> And the <HI>heads of agreement</HI> &s;ay, <Q>that none &s;hall be admitted as members, in order to communion in all the &s;pecial ordinances of the go&s;pel, but &s;uch

per&s;ons as are knowing and &s;ound in the fundamental doctrine of the chri&s;tian religion, without &s;candal in their lives, and to a judgment regulated by the word of God, are per&s;ons of vi&s;ible holine&s;s and hone&s;ty; credibly profe&s;|&s;ing cordial &s;ubjection to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> And when the bible is &s;o full on our &s;ide, and our confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and articles of di&s;cipline &s;o expre&s;s; and the half-way-covenant and half-way practice, neither name nor thing &s;o much as ever once mentioned in our platform&mdash;and the <HI>covenants</HI> in u&s;e in our churches generally as full as can be de&s;ired.&mdash;Would the clergy all unite in love as one man, our churches &s;urely might be reclaimed by the ble&s;&s;ing of God.&mdash;And if any of you, gentlemen pari&s;hioners, who are convinced in your con&s;ciences, that we only abide by and act agreeable to the in&s;titution of our Lord and Ma&s;ter, in refu&s;ing to practi&s;e on the half-way, &s;hould treat us ill, you will not be able to hope for mercy at the hands of God, on that con&s;ideration menti|oned in Paul's ca&s;e, 1 Tim. 1.13. <HI>I obtained mercy, becau&s;e I did it ignorantly, and in unbelief.</HI></P>
