<HEAD>A Letter from Connecticut to Elder E|LIAS LEE, Anabapti&s;t Teacher in the Vicinity of Ball&s;ton, State of New-York.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Norwalk, <DATE>November 16th, 1799.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A CONTROVERSY between you and Mr. Ro|gers the Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ter of Ball&s;ton, having late|ly fallen into my hands, wherein you are plea&s;ed to treat the Epi&s;copalians of the&s;e States in a very un|gentlemanly manner. I &s;hall at pre&s;ent only advert to your a&s;&s;ertions, that no man can a&s;certain the pre|ci&s;e day of the Nativity of our Lord, and of con&s;e|quence that Epi&s;copalians are &s;uper&s;titious and ab&s;urd in their ob&s;ervance of the 25th of December, as the anniver&s;ary of Chri&s;tmas. Hereafter, I &s;hall do my|&s;elf the plea&s;ure of addre&s;&s;ing you on the other ob&s;er|vances and doctrius &s;acred to Epi&s;copalians, with which you have taken, in my judgment, very un|warrantable freedoms.</P>
<P>To a man &s;o conver&s;ant with the &s;acred Scripture, and &s;o repleni&s;hed with the plenitude of the Holy Spirit, as you profe&s;s to be, the circum&s;tance of St. Luke's beginning his Go&s;pel with a chronological ac|count of an event immediately connected with our Saviour's Incarnation, and a virtual repetition of the &s;ame thing by the Holy Angel as the time of the An|nuciation, can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed matters of indiffer|ence: And yet it is evident that you have either o|verlooked or mi&s;taken the meaning of both; for you &s;ay it is a matter of indifference whether the day can be a&s;certained or not: The which I deny, and think it a matter of great con&s;equence to Chri&s;tianity that the day of our Lord's Nativity &s;hould be chronologi|cally a&s;certained. I will therefore, pre&s;ent you, and
<PB N="3" REF="037794_0003_100F52649E74CC78">the candid public, a calculation of the preci&s;e day of the Nativity founded upon two data, viz. the Old and New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>I. Chron. ch. 24, v. 7 to v. 20,&mdash;we find the twenty-four Cour&s;es of the Jewi&s;h Prie&s;ts e&s;tabli&s;hed by David, who was "a Prophet and a man after God's own heart," and knew perfectly what he was about when he made this e&s;tabli&s;hment. Of the&s;e 24 Cour&s;es, the 8th at the in&s;titution, fell by lot to Abi|jah or Abias, to which cour&s;e Zacharias the Father of the Bapti&s;t belonged. One cour&s;e attended upon the Service of the Temple, eight days, from &s;abbath to &s;abbath. The mini&s;try of each cour&s;e began at the morning &s;ervice of the fir&s;t, and ended at the morn|ing &s;ervice of the next &s;abbath; the High Prie&s;t en|tering into the Temple with the cour&s;e which &s;uc|ceeded, ble&s;&s;ed and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the cour&s;e, which had fulfilled their mini&s;trations, the Prie&s;ts of which then departed to their own city. And both the&s;e facts are authenticated both by Jo&s;ephus, and the Jewi&s;h Lit|urgy. The Jewi&s;h hi&s;torian (book 6) &s;ays, "The High Prie&s;t went into the Temple with the other Prie&s;ts, not every day, but only every &s;abbath day, the calends of every month, and the annaver&s;ary Fea&s;ts." And in the Jewi&s;h Liturgy we read, "On the Sabbath the High Prie&s;t added one benediction upon that cour&s;e, which then went out of their min|i&s;tration."</P>
<P>Therefore, as the mini&s;try of one cour&s;e is 7 com|plete days, and the number of cour&s;es 24:&mdash;the com|plete cycle or period of time, wherein the 24 cour&s;es return to the &s;ame <HI>day and hour</HI> wherein they fir&s;t minin&s;tered is 224 years. But as the above cycle is &s;omewhat unwieldy for calculation, a &s;maller cycle becomes nece&s;&s;ary, and there is one of 50 revolutions concluding at the end of 23 years after their fir&s;t in|&s;titution, or any revolution of the great cycle of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">24 years, with an overplus of 18 hours.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037794_0004_100F2797DF755458">
From the dedication of the &s;econd Temple, in the 6th year of Darius Nothus, on the 3d day of the Heb. month Adas, that is on the 19th of February, to the de&s;truction thereof, (according to Eu&s;ebius' Chron. of Daniel's 70 weeks, chap. 9) are exactly 490 years.</P>
<P>From our Saviour's birth to the de&s;truction of Je|ru&s;alem, and ju&s;t 71 years, (according to Scaliger and others) and from the 15th of Tiberus to the de|&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem by Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ian are 40 years.</P>
<P>From the&s;e data, the calculation of the time of Zacharias' mini&s;tration (which St. Luke mentions &s;o particularly) may be calculated thus:</P>
<P>In the 490 years that the Temple &s;tood, there are two complete great &s;acerdotal cycles ending with the year 448. There remains till the fall of the Temple 42 years: which &s;ubtract from the year of our Lord 71, in which the Temple fell, and there remains 29, the year of Chri&s;t, when the &s;econd great &s;acerdotal cycle ended and the third began, out of which deduct the imperfect cycle of 50 revolutions, or 23 years, the remaining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> denote the year of Chri&s;t, when the cour&s;e began preci&s;ely on the &s;ame day on which they originally commenced, with an orverplus of 18 hours.</P>
<P>Therefore in the&s;e 6 years previous to the Nativi|ty of our Lord, the &s;acerdotal cour&s;es &s;tand thus, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>In the 6th year, the 1&s;t cour&s;e, that of Jehoiarib began, Feb. 19</ITEM>
<ITEM>In the 5th year, the fir&s;t, &amp;c. Jan. 19</ITEM>

<ITEM>In the 1&s;t year, the fir&s;t, &amp;c. Sept. 19</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Therefore, the fir&s;t cour&s;e in the year of Chri&s;t's Conception began on the 19th of Augu&s;t; from whence, if we reckon to the 8th week, we come to
<PB N="5" REF="037794_0005_100F52670513BE60">the 8th cour&s;e, the cour&s;e of Abijah, or Abias which commences on the 7th of October, and ends on the 14th of the &s;ame month. On the 14th of October Zacharias having fulfilled his week's mini&s;try, re|turned home on the 15th, when his wife conceived preci&s;ely 5 months and 3 days, before the Annuncia|tion.</P>
<P>Now from the 15th of Oct. to the Annunciation March 25th are <HI>5m. 3w. 1d.</HI>&mdash;and ju&s;t &s;o long was Elizabeth advanced in her pregnancy at the time of the Angel's Salutation to the Virgin Mother&mdash;<HI>"This is the &s;ixth month with her who was called barren."</HI> This circum&s;tance is hinted at afterwards by the E|vangili&s;t, when he &s;ays,&mdash;(ch. 1. v. 56.) <HI>"Mary abode with her about three months,"</HI> that is, until the 24th of June, the day which the Church celebrates as the Nativity of the Bapti&s;t.</P>
<P>If then the Bapti&s;t was conceived on the 15th of October, and was advanced five months, three weeks and one day, at the time of the Conception of our Lord, that is the 25th of March, the day celebrated by the Church, in commemoration of &s;o &s;ignal a mer|cy; it follows, that the 25th of December is the true day of the Nativity <HI>of the Son of God.</HI></P>
<P>And hence it is evident, that the time of the Nati|vity of our Lord hath been fairly tran&s;mitted down to us, by our forefathers, and that the Chri&s;tian Church is a faithful guardain, of &s;o ine&s;timable a piece of chronology. God &s;aw proper to conceal the burial place of the body of Mo&s;es, le&s;t it &s;hould in fu|ture times become an object of adoration;&mdash;but on the body of Chri&s;t he be&s;towed &s;uch honor, that all the Angels of God, and the &s;ons of men wor&s;hip it;&mdash; and as the Law and the Prophets, with the divine Shekina pointed to the Birth-place of the Son of God; &s;o the cour&s;es of the Prie&s;ts offered an infallible cal|culation to point out the preci&s;e time, when the

<HEAD>A Letter to Mr. WILLIAM SMITH, of Norwalk, Connecticut, being a reply to a Letter addre&s;&s;ed by him to Elder ELIAS LEE, of Ball&s;ton, State of New-York, upon the &s;ubject of Chri&s;tmas.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Ball&s;ton,</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 21, 1800.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 9th of February la&s;t, I received a letter from a Mr. HUBBARD, of New-Haven, in which were inclo&s;ed two copies of a printed letter addre&s;&s;ed by you to me. In this letter you inform me, that you have &s;een the controver&s;y which tran&s;|pired la&s;t winter, between Mr. Rogers, the Epi&s;co|pal mini&s;ter of this town &amp; my&s;elf, upon the &s;ubject of Chri&s;tmas; and in which al&s;o, you have attempted a flual deci&s;ion of it. I confe&s;s that I was &s;omewhat &s;ur|pri&s;ed at fir&s;t, for as Mr. Rogers had repre&s;ented me in a very mean and contemptable light; and al&s;o pre|tended, that he had effectually an&s;wered my argu|ments, I never expected that any Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ter would take &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of me again, as to write again&s;t me upon that or any other &s;ubject; nor was I under any great concern about it. But this attempt of yours, leads me to conclude, that you con&s;ider it as a matter of great con&s;equence to your cau&s;e, and the only means to avoid the charge of &s;uper&s;tition, to render it certain that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was born upon the 25th day of December; it &s;eems al&s;o, that you are of opinion, that your friend Rogers, with all his preten|ces is quite inadequate to this important ta&s;k. Indeed, it has furni&s;hed me with one conclu&s;ion more, &amp; that
<PB N="7" REF="037794_0007_100F526A1672B058">is, that you are &s;en&s;ible of &s;o much weight in the ar|guments, and te&s;timonies, which I produced from &s;cripture and hi&s;tory, that unle&s;s you introduced this &s;avourite point to the public in &s;ome new method; or by a circumlocution of calculation, could bring it round at a di&s;tance from tho&s;e objections, it would be of no avail to undertake to &s;upport it. But as it is, whether you have &s;pent your &s;trength for naught, and your labour for that which fatisfieth not, the public will judge from what follows.</P>
<P>The &s;ole que&s;tion, to be decided between us at pre|&s;ent is, whether there be any certainty, that the birth of Chri&s;t happened upon the 25th of December. You &s;ay there is, and have given your rea&s;ons for it. I &s;ay, that notwith&s;tanding all you have &s;aid, there is not; and &s;hall now proceed to give the rea&s;ons which I have for my a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I &s;hall remark in your letter, is your a&s;&s;erting that I &s;aid, it was a matter of indffer|ence whether the day can be a&s;certained or not. But &s;ir, you &s;hould look &s;harper, and read with more at|tention; for though &s;uch a conclu&s;ion might be drawn from the nature of my rea&s;oning, yet the ob|&s;ervation was made by Mr. Rogers him&s;elf, and I have only made my remarks upon it. What you have &s;aid concerning the cour&s;es of the Jewi&s;h Prie&s;ts will an&s;wer you no purpo&s;e, unle&s;s you can prove that they kept an exact pace in their &s;ervice, with the or|der of time in your calculation; for the argument does not depend upon the time, as being regu|lated by their &s;ervice, but upon their &s;ervice, as being regulated by the time; one interruption there|fore, would throw your whole &s;y&s;tem into confu&s;ion, and wholly di&s;appoint you of finding Zacharias in the temple at the expected time. And that there have been &s;everal interruptions, is certain; for when the ark was inducted into the sacred oracle, and the tem|ple dedicated by Solomon, the prie&s;ts officiated alto|gether,
<PB N="8" REF="037794_0008_100F527B53AFD738">and did not wait by cour&s;e. Something sim|ilar, happened al&s;o in the days of king Hezekiah; and even &s;ome who have attempted to prove by their cour&s;es, that Chri&s;t was born in September, have failed to give &s;atisfaction, becau&s;e it could not be de|termined to a certainty, what number of years pa&s;&s;ed between the re&s;toration of the temple wor&s;hip, by Judas Maccabeus, and the time that Zacharias was &s;truck dumb; neither with what cour&s;e of prie&s;ts Judas began the re&s;toration.</P>
<P>But after giving a &s;tatement of the&s;e cour&s;es, it &s;eems your whole dependence for the u&s;e of them, in this controver&s;y, is re&s;ted upon Eu&s;ebius' calculation of the 70 weeks of Daniel; &s;hould there however be an uncertainty here al&s;o, your theory will appear in a wor&s;e &s;ituation than before. And now &s;ir, I might launch into an almo&s;t boundle&s;s aby&s;s of calculation, but I have no inclination to venture out, nor is my lit|tle bark, by any means &s;ufficient to pa&s;s the un&s;et|tled ocean of cronological difficulties; and even you, with all your &s;kill and learning, will in my opinion, &s;oon appear to have run fa&s;t aground upon the &s;hoals of conjecture, while you imagine, that you have &s;afe|ly arrived at that cardinal point in the Chri&s;tian aera, the certain day of our Saviour's nativity. If you are a gentleman of much reading, you cannot be ignorant, that &s;ome writers have made of the&s;e weeks 70 years; &s;o that the whole would amount to 4000 and 900 years. Some Rabbins make of them 49 years, reckoning from one jubilee to another; &s;o that they would con&s;i&s;t of 3000, 400 and 30 years. Others make an hundred years of them, which would bring the whole up to 7000 years. Mo&s;t interpreters however, con&s;ider them as weeks of years, which makes exactly 490 years; but even tho&s;e who be|lieve the prediction marks out the time of the birth &amp; pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour, are exceedingly divided, as to the certain time of their beginning and ending. Some
<PB N="9" REF="037794_0009_100F526C59BAF9A0">begin them from the 1&s;t year of Cyrus, and end them at the de&s;truction of the temple by the Ro|mans; but if the temple was de&s;troyed in the year 70, or 71, as &s;ome &s;ay; then according to the bible chronology, which is as correct, and I believe the mo&s;t adhered to of any, the term of time from the 1&s;t year of Cyrus to that event, was 606, or 7 years. Others begin them from the 1&s;t year of Darius the Mede, and end them at the birth of Chri&s;t, as near as they can come to it; but this makes an interim of 538 years. Others begin them at the 1&s;t year of Da|rius, and conclude them at the prophanation of the temple by Antiochus Epiphanes, which makes a pe|riod only of 370 years. I have not read Eu&s;ebius, but according to your account, he begins them at the dedication of the &s;econd temple, and ends them with the de&s;truction of it; but in&s;tead of 490 years, you will find the &s;pace of time between the&s;e events, to be 585 or 6 years. Julius Africanus, begins them in the 2d year of Artaxerxes, and ends them at the death of Chri&s;t, which he thinks happened in the 15th year of Tiberius. This calculation comes with|in two or three years of it, and as a learned anon|ymous writer ob&s;erves, is the mo&s;t rational &s;y&s;tem of any propo&s;ed by the ancients, and to which a few things excepted, the greate&s;t part of interpreters, and Chronologers agree. I confe&s;s however, that I differ a little from it; it being plain, that both the begin|ning, and end of this period, is hinted at in the pro|phecy&mdash;Know therefore, and under&s;tand, that from the going forth of the comandment, to re&s;tore, and to build Jeru&s;alem &amp;c. This appers to be the &s;ub&s;tance in part, of what is couched in the foregoing ver&s;e; and taking the &s;en&s;e of the whole ver&s;e complete, it fini&s;hes the period at the death of Chri&s;t; for the fini&s;hing of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, making an end of fins, ma|king reconciliation for iniquity, bringing in everla&s;|ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ealing up the vi&s;ion and prophe|cy,
<PB N="10" REF="037794_0010_100F527D96649310">and anointing the mo&s;t holy, &s;ounds to me &s;o much like the declaration of the dying Saviour on the cro&s;s&mdash;it is fini&s;hed&mdash;that I can hardly believe it re|fers to any thing el&s;e. Almo&s;t all interpreters agree that Chri&s;t died between the age of 30, and 34 years; &s;o that if we &s;uppo&s;e the commandment, refers to the decrees given out in the 7th year of Artaxerxes Lon|gimanus, as recorded in the 7th chap. of Ezra, which was in the year before Chri&s;t 457, and then add 33 years for the life of Chri&s;t, it makes out the 490 years exactly. There are however &s;o many difficulties attending the&s;e different hypothe&s;is, that it would be folly to the la&s;t degree, to pretend to find an ab&s;olute certainty in any of them; much le&s;s in that of Eu|&s;ebius, which is as de&s;titute of probability, and per|haps as little attended to as any one of the whole, &amp; is therefore, but a poor foundation for you to tru&s;t to in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But Sir, &s;uppo&s;ing you was quite &s;afe hitherto, yet what follows would completely unhinge your conclu|&s;ion, and &s;et all afloat at once. You &s;ay that Eliza|beth conceived on the 15th of October, preci&s;ely 5 months, and 3 days before the annunciation; but ac|cording to this, the annunciation mu&s;t happen on the 18th of March. You then proceed to ob&s;erve, that from the 15th of October to the annunciation, March 25th, are 5 months, 3 weeks, and one day; and ju&s;t &s;o long was Elizabeth advanced in her preg|nancy, at the time of the angels &s;alutation to the vir|gin mother&mdash;but by what rule you have made this out, I cannot tell, unle&s;s you have &s;plit &s;ome of the days and made two of them, for I cannot find from the 15th of October to the 25th of March, but 5 months, 1 week, and 3 days. I thought this at fir&s;t to have been a typographical error; but finding it a little after repeated at full length, I began to &s;earch after the my&s;tery, and &s;oon found, that from the con|ception of Chri&s;t to his birth, you had allowed ju&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="037794_0011_100F526E9E89D730">23 days more than you had allowed for John in the &s;ame ca&s;e. And &s;ince you calculate from the concep|tion, to find the certain time of a birth; to make &s;uch a difference between the&s;e two, mu&s;t appear very ex|traordinary indeed; it &s;eems you were therefere &s;en|&s;ible that the 3 weeks and 1 day, mu&s;t be thru&s;t in &s;omewhere between the 15th of October, and the 24th of June. Your opinion however, that the 3 months, in which Mary tarried with Elizabeth extended from the 25th of March to the period la&s;t mentioned, left no room for them there; you have therefore, croud|ed them between the 15th of October, and the annun|ciation; but as only ten days of them are there, I &s;hall leave you to &s;earch for the other 12 wherever you can find them.</P>
<P>Now Sir, to make your calculation con&s;i&s;tent with the principle you &s;et out upon, viz. of finding the time of a birth, by the conception; if we reckon by the month, from the 25th of March to the 25th of December, and from the 15th of Octo. to the 15th of July, are ju&s;t 9 months each; but if we reckon by the day, there is a difference of 2 days; and as Ma|ry vi&s;ited Elizabeth about the time of the annuncia|tion, and tarried with her 3 months, until John was born, or to the 15th of July the annunciation mu&s;t have happened about the 15th of April, and Chri&s;t|mas mu&s;t come about the middle of January. But if you &s;uppo&s;e that John was born on the 24th of June, then you mu&s;t either in&s;i&s;t upon it, that John was born 23 days &s;ooner, after he was conceived, than Chri&s;t was, which will evidently de&s;troy the principle above referred to; or frankly admit that Elizabeth conceived on the 24th of September, which will effectually operate again&s;t the order of your cal|culation, &s;o that turn which way you will, your whole &s;y&s;tem is unhinged, and mu&s;t inevitably fall to the ground. And again, if Elizabeth conceived on the 15th of Octo. and was advanced 5 months, 3
<PB N="12" REF="037794_0012_100F5280DDD5C1A0">weeks and a day, at the time of the annunciation, as you affirm; then the annunciation mu&s;t happen upon the 6th day of April, and Chri&s;tmas would come of cour&s;e upon the 6th of January, the preci&s;e day on which mo&s;t of the Greek Fathers after the 4th centu|ry, thought the Saviour was born.</P>
<P>But dear Sir, where now is the infalliable calcula|tion you &s;peak of, which renders it &s;o certain, that the 25th of December is the true Chri&s;tmas? For my part, I think it evident, that as God &s;aw fit to conceal the Sepulchre of Mo&s;es, le&s;t it &s;hould after|wards become an object of adoration; &s;o he has pro|videntially ob&s;cured the day of Chri&s;t's nativity, le&s;t it &s;hould be more reverenced by the &s;ons of men, than Chri&s;t him&s;elf;&mdash;but notwith&s;tanding all this, &s;uper|&s;tition has prevailed, a day has been appointed at un|certainty, and religious devotion paid to it, in &s;uch a manner, as in my opinion, highly derogates from the honor of the ever Adorable Redeemer. It is however improbable to me, that this will have any &s;alutary effect upon your mind; I mu&s;t therefore &s;ay to you, as Paul &s;aid to the Galatians of old, "ye ob|&s;erve days, and months, and times, and years; I am afraid of you, le&s;t I have be&s;towed upon you labour in vain." I was thinking to make a few more re|marks, but I finally conclude to lay up my pen, till I hear &s;omething from you, upon the other ob&s;ervanc|es, and doctrines &s;acred to Epi&s;copalians.</P>
