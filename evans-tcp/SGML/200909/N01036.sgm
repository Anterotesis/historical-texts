Thus is appears, that this Com|mi&s;&s;ion was delivered to them in <HI>Galilee,</HI> and immediately upon their fir&s;t &s;ight of him after his Re&s;urrection.

<P>I que&s;tion, Whether they entred upon their Mini&s;try, as &s;oon as they received their Commi&s;&s;ion? <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> No, for they received their Commi&s;&s;ion in <HI>Galilee,</HI> as be|fore hath been proved; and immediately upon the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, but he a&s;&s;embled him&s;elf with them forty days after this, and commanded them to wait at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> for the promi&s;e of the Spirit, which <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> fore-told of; &s;aying, <HI>Is &s;hall baptize you with the holy Gho&s;t, and with Fire,</HI> Acts 1.4, 5.

<P>Now while they were waiting at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> with one accord, in one place, &s;uddenly there came a &s;ound from heaven, as of a ru&s;hing mighty Wind, and it filled all the hou&s;e, where they were &s;itting; and there appeared unto them cloven Tongues, like as of fire, and it &s;at upon each of them; and they were all filled with the holy Gho&s;t.

Here it appears plainly, what Doc|trines they were ordered to preach, and what Bapti&s;m they were ordered to Baptize with, under this Commi&s;&s;ion; for now they have di&s;covered it to all nations under hea|ven at once. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to their Doctrine, they preach a crucified Chri&s;t to them, and te&s;tifie to them, that God hath rai&s;ed him from the dead; and that they are his wit|ne&s;&s;es of the truth of it; this is their Doc|trine which they go to di&s;ciple them into the belief of; and it is &s;uch a Doctrine which was never before preacht, which Doctrine did prick them to their hearts, and made them cry out to know what was required of them to do?

So that this Bapti&s;m which they were to baptize with, in this Commi&s;&s;ion, was &s;uch a Bapti&s;m, as they could baptize them with, before they received the holy Gho&s;t; for the gift of the holy Gho&s;t was that Bapti&s;m which the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves were at this time baptized with, before their eyes, and is proper only to Je&s;us Chri&s;t to baptize with, who hath the Spirit without mea&s;ure, and who alone can baptize with it. So that it appears, this Bapti&s;m which the Apo&s;tles were to Baptize with, under this Comi&s;&s;ion, was to guide their faith, in that doctrine which they taught them, to wit, in Chri&s;ts death and Re&s;urrection, by which faith they &s;hould come to obtain the Remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, and al&s;o come to receive the gift of the holy Gho&s;t from him who alone is able to baptize with the Spirit, and thereby to &s;eal to their Mini&s;try and Apo&s;tle&s;hip. And we have here a further account that they which gladly received his Word, were baptized, and continued &s;tedfa&s;tly in the Apo&s;tles Doctrine, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayer: Thus they taught them, as they were ordered in their Commi&s;&s;ion; for

And among other things, we have here an account, that they taught them the Ordinance of breaking of Bread, which was to be a guide to their Faith, that by the death of Chri&s;t, his Church comes to be fed with the Bread of Life from heaven, and is to continue in his Church, to &s;hew forth his death till he comes, who hath purcha&s;ed by his bitter Death, this living Bread &s;ent down from heaven, to feed and nouri&s;h his Church with.</P>
<P>Seeing it was the purpo&s;e of our Lord to let all the world know, what Bapti&s;m they were commi&s;&s;ionated to baptize with in this commi&s;&s;ion, by their publick Mini|&s;try, let us therefore go on, and view what bapti&s;m they did baptize with, and their Succe&s;&s;ors, who had their information from the Apo&s;tles mouthes; for it was the Pro|mi&s;e of Chri&s;t, in that Commi&s;&s;ion, to be with them, and with their Succe&s;&s;ors, in their Mini&s;tration, even unto the end of the world; &s;o that we mu&s;t be guided by their Doctrine and Practice, which is a &s;tanding Rule, which Chri&s;t hath &s;et in his Church, even unto the end of the world.</P>

In the <HI>8th Chap.</HI> of the <HI>Acts,</HI> we have an accourt, that <HI>Phillip</HI> had an immediate Call of God, to the work of the Mini&s;try, who was the Apo&s;tles Succe&s;&s;or in their day and time, who had information from their Mouthes, what their Orders in that Com|mi&s;&s;ion was, who followed their foot &s;teps, came to <HI>Samarita</HI> and there preached the Go&s;pel to them, and both men and women believed, and were bapti&s;ed. Now when the Apo&s;tles which were at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> heard that the Samaritans had received the Word of God, they &s;ent unto them <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> (the&s;e are the two chief of them, which received the orders and directons from Chri&s;ts own Mouth, from whom Phil|lip had his directions,) who when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might recive the holy Gho&s;t; for as yet, he was fallen upon none of them, on|ly they were baptized into the Name of the Lord Je&s;us; for &s;o all the latter tran|&s;lators agree to, that it is the &s;ame word that is in the Commi&s;tion, to wit, into the Name of the Lord Je&s;us; &s;o likewi&s;e, where <HI>Paul</HI> thanked God, he baptized only <HI>Cri&s;pus</HI> and <HI>Gaius</HI> of the <HI>Corinthians</HI> le&s;t (&s;aith he) any &s;hould &s;ay I had baptized into my own name, u&s;ing the word <HI>into</HI> according to the Commi&s;&s;ion; &s;o that it appears, the&s;e which

Now both the&s;e Mini|&s;ters were Succe&s;&s;ors to the twelve Apo&s;tles being afterwards immediately called to preach the Go&s;pel, and received this Ordi|nance of Bapti&s;m, by tradition, from the Apo&s;tles, who delivered it to the Church by Chri&s;ts order, to be a &s;ettled Ordinance, to guide the faith of the Church in Chri&s;ts death, for the Remi&s;&s;ion of her &s;ins, that the Church might not be bewildered in her imaginations, concerning the Remi&s;&s;ion of her &s;ins, but might know it to be by the death of Chri&s;t, which Bapti&s;in pointeth at; as will appear more evidently hereafter</P>
<P>So that by this Bapti&s;m, they baptized them into a profe&s;&s;ion of the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, believing that the Remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins came only and alone by the meritorious Death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom they are ju&s;tified; and upon this Faith and Bapti&s;m Chri&s;t him&s;elf, as Saviour, bap|tizeth them with the holy Gho&s;t, by which Bapti&s;m he &s;eals his name upon them; for it is he only that hath the Seal of the living God, and &s;o &s;eals us to the day of Re|demption, by his holy Spirit; but not the Apo&s;tles, nor any other Mini&s;ter.</P>

And as I before &s;aid, when <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> were come down, they prayed for them (whom <HI>Phillip</HI> had before baptized into the name of the Lord Je&s;us, that is, into the faith of the Lord Je&s;us,) that they might recive the holy Gho&s;t; for as yet he was fallen upon none of them, (&s;aith the Scripture,) but only they were baptized into the name of the Lord Je&s;ns; then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy Gho&s;t.

<P>And in the <HI>10th</HI> of the <HI>Acts,</HI> we have an account, that the Angel of the Lord appeare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unto <HI>Cornelius,</HI> and bid him &s;end for <HI>Peter,</HI> for (&s;aith the Angel) he &s;hall tell thee what thou oughte&s;t to do.

<PB N="69" REF="001233_0070_0FB1358A167D33C0">what they did and taught, was Gods mouth to us; and the Orders they received, was immediate from Chri&s;ts mouth.

<P>And as to the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> tho' he was immediately called of God to preach the Go&s;pel, (as all Gods Mini&s;ters are,) yet he was the Apo&s;tles Succe&s;&s;or, and therefore mu&s;t receive his orders &s;ucces&s;ively; for he comes under the order of their Commis&s;ion and therefore when the Lord fir&s;t appeared unto him, <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid, What &s;hall I do Lord? and the Lord &s;aid unto him, ari&s;e, and go into <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> and there it &s;hall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. Thus he is ordered to receive his Directions from his Predece&s;&s;ors, they mu&s;t be Chri&s;ts mouth to him, which is agreeable to the Scriptures handing them
<PB N="72" REF="001233_0073_0FB1359144E1D120">down to us, from their mouth; for when <HI>Annanias</HI> came to him, to inform him what he &s;hould do, and had laid his hands on him &s;o that he had received his &s;ight, and was filled with the holy Gho&s;t, why tarrie&s;t thou (&s;aith <HI>Annania<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>) ari&s;e and be baptized, <HI>Acts</HI> 22.16. compared with <HI>Acts</HI> 9.17, 18.
