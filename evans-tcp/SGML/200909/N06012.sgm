<Q><BIBL>ISAIAH xxi. 11, 12.</BIBL>
<P>The Burden of <HI>DUMAH.</HI> He calleth to me out of <HI>SEIR,</HI> Watchman, What of the Night? Watchman, What of the Night? The Watchman &s;aid, The Morning cometh, and al&s;o the Night, if ye will enquire; enquire, ye; return; come.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT may doubtle&s;s, at fir&s;t View, appear &s;trange to my Brethren, that I have cho&s;en this <HI>ob&s;cure Pa&s;&s;age</HI> of &s;acred Writ for your Entertainment; when it might be expected, that the <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Duties;</HI> the <HI>Com|forts</HI> and <HI>Trials</HI> of the mini&s;terial Office &s;hould be explained, or the be&s;t Method of &s;ecuring good Di&s;cipline and &s;ound Doctrine in the Church, laid open. The&s;e Subjects, I con|fels, are highly proper to be in&s;i&s;ted on, and &s;hould gene|rally be the Topics of our Di&s;cour&s;e, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions as the&s;e. But, &s;ome dark Apprehen&s;ions, as to the <HI>Times</HI> into which we are fallen, turned my Mind to this Subject: And as it will lead our Thoughts to the pre&s;ent <HI>Dangers</HI> and <HI>Trials;</HI> to the farther <HI>Pro&s;pects</HI> and <HI>Hopes</HI> relating to the Church of CHRIST, it will, I imagine, when properly explained and applied, be thought not un&s;uitable for tho&s;e, who are a&s;&s;embled to con&s;ult its Welfare and Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>WHAT I &s;hall attempt, is,</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> To explain the Woras, and illu&s;trate the Prophe&s;y, by &s;uch hi&s;torical Events, as &s;eem to point out the Fulfilment of it, in its primary View.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007628_0003_102D771D700872A0">
<HI>II.</HI> Apply it to the State of the Church in general, and to the Times into which we are fallen, in particular.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>enigmatical Prophe&s;y,</HI> &s;eems in its primary View, to denote &s;ome further Calamity on the IDUMEANS, after the JEWS &s;hould be delivered from the <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> they were then under; that while the <HI>Morning</HI> aro&s;e to the one, the <HI>Night</HI> &s;hould be continued to the other. It is called the <HI>Burden</HI> of DUMAH, becau&s;e it brings &s;ad and dark Tydings, what would prove an heavy Burden, hard to be born. DUMAH here, by a Contraction not unu&s;ual in the &s;acred Writings, &s;eems evidently to be put for EDOM; and &s;o for the Country IDUMEA, where the EDOMITES dwelt. This appears plain, by SEIR's being mentioned as the Place from whence the <HI>Voice</HI> came, which was that moun|tainous Part of IDUMEA, that lay next to the Land of CANAAN. The SEPTUAGINT therefore well tran&s;late it, <HI>To' Horamatees Idumaias,</HI> i. e. the Vi&s;ion of IDUMEA. In this <HI>prophetic Scene,</HI> there is one from that Country intro|duced, as addre&s;&s;ing the Prophet in great Earne&s;tne&s;s, about the State of the <HI>Night,</HI> or that <HI>State</HI> of Affliction and Oppre&s;&s;ion, which both the JEWS and IDUMEANS were under. <HI>He calleth</HI> (or there is one that calleth, or crieth) <HI>to me out of</HI> SEIR. The Word mu&s;t be taken <HI>col|lectively,</HI> not denoting a particular Per&s;on, q. d. <HI>there is a Cry,</HI> or <HI>the Voice of the&s;e that cry from that Country;</HI> this appears from the An&s;wer of the Prophet, <HI>If ye will enquire, &amp;c.</HI> 'Tis ob&s;erved that the original Word <HI>Karah,</HI> has an <HI>Empha&s;is</HI> in it, and denotes the <HI>Cry</HI> of Men in Angui&s;h and Di&s;tre&s;s, impatiently waiting to &s;ee the End of their <HI>Cala|mity,</HI> and the <HI>Dawn</HI> of the Morning of their Deliverance. This &s;hews a Beauty in the <HI>&s;cenical Repre&s;entation;</HI> as the Prophet is on the Watch-Tower among the JEWS, at a great Di&s;tance from <HI>Mount Seir,</HI> the Voice mu&s;t be loud, in order to be heard. The Que&s;tion follows, <Q><HI>Watchman, What of the Night,</HI> or from, or concerning the <HI>Night?</HI></Q> The Conjecture of COCCEIUS, and &s;ome other <HI>learned Com|mentators,</HI> that the <HI>Voice</HI> is directed to GOD the Father, under the Character of <HI>a Watchman,</HI> becau&s;e he is &s;tiled
<PB N="5" REF="007628_0004_102D7712573FA518">the <HI>Keeper of</HI> ISRAEL; or to the SON, who is repre&s;ented as the <HI>Shepherd of his People,</HI> I think groundle&s;s. It is not &s;uppo&s;able, that the <HI>Idumeans</HI> had any &s;uch di&s;tinct Notion of the <HI>Father</HI> or the <HI>Son,</HI> as to addre&s;s <HI>one</HI> or the <HI>other</HI> by this Title.&mdash;To apply it to the <HI>Prophet him&s;elf,</HI> &s;eems much more natural; the Prophets being well known by the Character of <HI>Watchmen,</HI> as pointing out the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> and <HI>Duties</HI> of their Office: And thus they are frequently &s;tiled in <HI>&s;acred Writ,</HI>

<PB N="6" REF="007628_0005_102D771F53784890">Signs that the pre&s;ent Scene of <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> will &s;oon be over? The Que&s;tion is undoubtedly not about a <HI>natural</HI> but <HI>me|taphorical</HI> Night,&mdash;that State of <HI>Calamity</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Idumeans</HI> were under by the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> or <HI>Babylo|nians;</HI> or, that <HI>dark Di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> the End of which was then expected, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired.

<P>IT may perhaps &s;eem &s;trange at <HI>fir&s;t View,</HI> that the <HI>Idu|means</HI> &s;hould make this Inquiry. What had they to do with the <HI>Prophets</HI> or the <HI>divine Oracles?</HI>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">EPM, ii, 12.</NOTE> Who were <HI>Aliens from the Common-Wealth of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and Strangers from the Covenant of Promi&s;e.</HI>&mdash;But, the Difficulty will vani&s;h, if we con&s;ider that the Scheme of this Prophe&s;y is <HI>emblema|tical</HI> and <HI>figurative.</HI> The <HI>Idumeans</HI> are introduced here by the <HI>Prophet,</HI> as breathing after Deliverance under their <HI>Calamities,</HI> and making &s;uch anxious Inquiries as it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e a People in their <HI>Situation</HI> would; and hearing that Deliverance was expected by the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation,</HI> it was natural for them to de&s;ire to know the <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of it, in Hopes they al&s;o might Share in its Fa|vour.&mdash;To this may be added&mdash;That the ea&s;tern Nations had a Veneration for the <HI>Prophets of the</HI> GOD <HI>of</HI> I&s;rael, who&s;e Fame was &s;pread among them. And if we apply it to the then <HI>dark State</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> an Enquiry re&s;pect|ing a more glorious Di&s;pen&s;ation, in which them&s;elves, and all the <HI>gentile World</HI> were concerned, comes from them with &s;ingular Propriety. Some &s;uppo&s;e the Que&s;tion put by way of <HI>Deri&s;ion,</HI> but I think without Foundation; had that been the Ca&s;e, the <HI>Prophet</HI> would have given them a very different An&s;wer. They &s;eem to have a Degree of <HI>Earne&s;tne&s;s</HI> about the Matter, and yet do not enquire with that <HI>Faith,</HI> and &s;uch <HI>religious Views</HI> as they ought. This is evident from the <HI>Prophets</HI> reply. <HI>The Morning cometh, and al&s;o the Night, of ye will enquire; enquire, ye; return; come.</HI> (i. e.) The <HI>Morning</HI> will be as dangerous as the <HI>Night,</HI> &s;ay &s;ome. Others tran&s;late it, the <HI>Morning</HI> cometh, and yet
<PB N="7" REF="007628_0006_102D771423B9F730">it is <HI>Night.</HI> i. e. Tho' there be a Deliverance from pre&s;ent Calamities, yet it will be but <HI>partial; Light</HI> comes, but <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> will be intermixed with it; or according to our Tran&s;lation, <HI>The Morning cometh, but the Night will &s;oon &s;ucceed.</HI> It may mean, That tho' the <HI>Morning</HI> is coming to the <HI>People of</HI> GOD, it would &s;till be <HI>Night</HI> with the <HI>Idu|means.</HI> 'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee, that as <HI>Night</HI> is put for a State of <HI>Affliction, Day</HI> is a proper Emblem of <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Comfort. If ye will enquire; enquire, ye; return; come.</HI> The old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation under <HI>Henry the</HI> VIIIth, has it thus, <Q><HI>If ye will enquire indeed, and a&s;k Que&s;tions in Earne&s;t, enquire of</HI> GOD; fir&s;t a&s;k his Mercy, and then come again, and you &s;hall have a more favourable An&s;wer,</Q> which &s;eems not far from the true Meaning.</P>
<P>As the Que&s;tion, tho' not put with that Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Sincerity as it ought, implied a De&s;ire to know the Pur|po&s;e of GOD relating to their <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> dark and di&s;mal Situ|ation; the An&s;wer &s;eems to be to this Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Since you <HI>Idumeans,</HI> in your di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Condition, &s;eem to come to your&s;elves, expre&s;s a De&s;ire of returning to GOD, and knowing his <HI>Will</HI> concerning you, be in earne&s;t in the Matter, enquire with Hearts &s;uitably affected, with the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ations</HI> of divine Providence, with &s;incere De&s;ires to <HI>know</HI> and <HI>comply</HI> with your Duty. Return to the <HI>God of I&s;rael,</HI> come into the <HI>Bo&s;om</HI> and <HI>Communion</HI> of the Church; &s;ince you are de&s;cended from <HI>Abraham,</HI> &s;hew your&s;elves to be his <HI>Children</HI> indeed; come with <HI>Sincerity</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> to me and the other <HI>Prophets,</HI> to know the Mind and Will of GOD, and be &s;uitably prepared to meet him, when he &s;hall come forth again&s;t you. The Sum of what I have &s;aid is this: The <HI>neighbouring Notions,</HI> groaning under the &s;ame Oppre&s;&s;ion from the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> and <HI>Babyloni&s;h Princes,</HI> as the <HI>Jews</HI> were, tho' the <HI>peculiar People</HI> of GOD, and favoured with his true <HI>Prophets;</HI> the <HI>Idumeans</HI> are introduced, en|quiring after the <HI>Duration,</HI> and <HI>End</HI> of this common Cala|mity, in too carele&s;s a Manner, with too little Reverence or religious Sen&s;e of the Divine Di&s;pen&s;ation. They have for An&s;wer, That the <HI>Morning</HI> was coming, i. e. <HI>Light</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="007628_0007_102D7720E2EFBDA8"><HI>Liberty</HI> to the <HI>Jews;</HI> but that the <HI>Night</HI> &s;till awaited them; i. e. their pre&s;ent Afflictions and &s;piritual Darkne&s;s, would continue, while they maintain'd their <HI>pre&s;ent Temper</HI> of Mind towards GOD, and remained <HI>Strangers to the Common-Wealth of I&s;rael.</HI> He therefore exhorts them to return to GOD, and enquire with a religious Di&s;po&s;ition, and right <HI>Views</HI> about this Matter.</P>
<P>THIS Interpretation may be illu&s;trated by <HI>hi&s;torical Events;</HI> either by refering it to the common Calamities that befel the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Idumeans,</HI> with other <HI>neighbouring Nations,</HI> under <HI>Senacherib</HI> King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria;</HI> or to that which after|ward befel them under the Kings of <HI>Babylon.</HI> If to the <HI>former,</HI> the <HI>Morning</HI> that aro&s;e to the <HI>Jews,</HI> mu&s;t be the <HI>miraculous Deliverance</HI> granted them, by the terrible De|&s;truction of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian Army</HI> by an Angel.
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Kings, xix. 35.</NOTE> The like Deliverance not being granted to the <HI>Idumeans,</HI> with them it remained <HI>Night.</HI> But, I rather &s;uppo&s;e it may refer to the <HI>Babyloni&s;h Captivity,</HI> which involved the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Idumeans</HI> in one common <HI>Night</HI> of Calamity and Di&s;tre&s;s, after which <HI>long Night,</HI> wherein the Church &s;eemed as it were buried, a <HI>glorious Morning</HI> aro&s;e to the <HI>Jews,</HI> from the Deliverance granted by <HI>Cyrus;</HI> while the <HI>Idumeans</HI> conti|nued in Darkne&s;s; as appears by <HI>Malachi,</HI> who lived after the Return of the <HI>Jews</HI> from the <HI>Babyloni&s;h Captivity;</HI> and de&s;cribes the <HI>Idumeans</HI> as impoveri&s;hed, unable to return and rebuild their wa&s;te Places; being under the peculiar Di&s;plea&s;ure of Heaven.

<P><HI>II.</HI> To another View in which this prophetic De&s;cription may be taken, and with Propriety applied to &s;ome remarkable Periods in the Church.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Prophets</HI> were &s;et as <HI>Watchmen,</HI> on the <HI>Walls of God's Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to publi&s;h his De&s;igns of Mercy and Judgment to the <HI>Church</HI> and the <HI>World;</HI> &s;uch as were concerned to know the <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> of God's favour|ing his <HI>Zion,</HI> would naturally enquire at <HI>their Mouths,</HI> and as the <HI>Idumeans</HI> &s;prang originally from the <HI>&s;ame Family</HI>

<P>BY the <HI>Night,</HI> we may under&s;tand the ob&s;cure Di&s;pen|&s;ation they were then under, which was u&s;hered in with <HI>Blackne&s;s, Darkne&s;s, and a thick Tempe&s;t.</HI> It is therefore called <HI>a Mini&s;tration of Death, and Condemnation,</HI> and pro|ved &s;o to the carnal <HI>Jews,</HI> who re&s;ted in the <HI>Law graven on Stones,</HI> not looking to <HI>him</HI> who was the <HI>End of it for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to all that believe.</HI></P>

<P>THE Sum of which Pa&s;&s;age &s;eems to be this, <HI>viz.</HI> That when the&s;e faithful Witne&s;&s;es who have &s;o long prophe&s;ied in <HI>Sackcloth,</HI> are about concluding their <HI>Te&s;timony,</HI> there will be a &s;evere Per&s;ecution rai&s;ed by the <HI>antichri&s;tian</HI> Party, whereby all the faithful Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, will appear to be <HI>&s;ilenced</HI> or <HI>&s;lain,</HI> and that in the mo&s;t <HI>public, open,</HI> and <HI>ignominious</HI> Manner, &s;o that their Enemies &s;hall triumph as tho' the Day were their own; but this will continue only for a &s;hort Time, <HI>three Days and an Half;</HI> which, if it does not mean <HI>three Years</HI> and an <HI>Half,</HI> taking according to prophetic Stile, a <HI>Day</HI> for a <HI>Year;</HI> yet it doubtle&s;s means, that this Time of their Suffering will be but &s;hort, compared to the Time of their <HI>prophe&s;ying</HI> in <HI>Sackcloth;</HI> it will be but as a Day to a Year, as that is a <HI>Time, Times</HI> and <HI>half a Time,</HI> 1260 <HI>Years.</HI> After this they &s;hall not only be re&s;tored to their former Liberty, but exalted to &s;uch a State of <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Security,</HI> as they never before enjoyed, and that in the Pre&s;ence, and to the Con|fu&s;ion of their Enemies; and the Rea&s;ons which have made it appear to me not improbable that the Church has this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Scene yet to pa&s;s thro', are &s;uch as the&s;e:</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> IT is to be at the Conclu&s;ion of their prophe&s;ying in Sackcloth, when they have ju&s;t fini&s;hed their Te&s;ti|mony. <HI>When they &s;hall have fini&s;hed their Te&s;timony.</HI> Thus we tran&s;late it, which indeed &s;eems the mo&s;t natural, genuine Con&s;truction of <HI>hotan tele&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;i, cum perfecerint,</HI> when they have about <HI>compleated</HI> or <HI>fini&s;hed off their</HI> Te&s;ti|mony, as the original Word properly &s;ignifies; at the Clo&s;e of 1260 Days, when the Period of <HI>Antichri&s;t's Reign</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="007628_0022_102D7737DE65EBE0">will be ju&s;t at an End.

<P><HI>2d,</HI> HISTORY affords no pa&s;t Events to which the <HI>&s;laying</HI> and <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> of the Witne&s;&s;es, can well be ap|plied. Some learned Men have, I know, endeavoured to find the Accompli&s;hment of it, in &s;undry <HI>Per&s;ecutions,</HI> bro't on the faithful Witne&s;&s;es for the Truth, none of which &s;eem fully to an&s;wer the <HI>prophetic</HI> De&s;cription given of that Event. The <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> (Followers of <HI>Peter Waldo,</HI> a Merchant of <HI>Lyons,</HI> in <HI>France</HI>) <HI>A. D.</HI> 1160, were per|&s;ecuted with great Severity: 'Tis computed, that not le&s;s than 80,000 &s;ealed their Te&s;timony to the <HI>Truths of God,</HI> with their Blood. Above a Million of the <HI>Albigen&s;es</HI> (&s;o called from their native Country in <HI>Languedoc</HI>) fell a Sa|crifice in the &s;ame glorious Cau&s;e; but the&s;e were of too early a Date to an&s;wer the De&s;cription; of too long Con|tinuance, and confined to a particular Country; whereas the <HI>&s;laying of the Witne&s;&s;es</HI> will be a general Thing; and it is worthy of Remark, that this was in a Country where the Witne&s;&s;es have, almo&s;t ever &s;ince, prophe&s;ied in <HI>Sack|cloth,</HI> as all acquainted with the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> well know. If they were &s;lain in that Place, it is hard to &s;ay, when they ro&s;e, or were exalted. Much le&s;s can we find this Event accompli&s;hed, in the &s;hort Per&s;ecutions by <HI>Queen</HI> MARY, in <HI>England,</HI> or under the <HI>Duke of Savoy,</HI> in <HI>Pied|mont,</HI> which were confined to &s;o &s;mall a Part of the Church, however exactly they may &s;eem to an&s;wer as to Duration. Many &s;evere Per&s;ecutions have been carried on by the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> in <HI>Hungary, Bohemia,</HI> many Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and repeatedly in <HI>France;</HI> but all the&s;e were only partial <HI>&s;laying of the Witne&s;&s;es.</HI> They were never &s;o univer&s;ally cut off, as the Prophe&s;y &s;eems to repre&s;ent.</P>

<HI>3d,</HI> IT would be difficult to &s;how, that there ever has been that <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> and glorious <HI>Exaltation</HI> of the Wit|ne&s;&s;es, which is to follow immediately after their <HI>lying dead three Days and an Half.</HI> What like this has happened upon any of the Per&s;ecutions that have yet been on the prote&s;|tant Churches?

They are to put off their <HI>Sackcloth,</HI> and put it on no more. The Reproach of their former &s;uffering State, will be wiped away: But the faithful Witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;t don't &s;eem ever yet to have enjoyed any &s;uch State of <HI>Honour, Power, Influence</HI> and <HI>Security,</HI> as is here repre&s;ented.
