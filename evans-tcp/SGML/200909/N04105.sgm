Only un|der&s;tand me here aright; I am not now &s;peaking of Man's Deliverance and Salvation by Price, in Way of Satisfaction to Ju&s;tice, (for that I have already hand|led) but of his Deliverance and Salvation by Power; not of Man's purcha&s;ed Deliverance, which is by the Blood of Chri&s;t, but of Man's actual Deliverance, which is by the Efficacy and Power of the Spirit of Chri&s;t. Some Captives among Men, are redeemed by Price only, &s;ome by Power without Price; but &s;uch is the lamentable Captivity of all Men, under the Severity of Ju&s;tice, and Power of Sin, that without the Price of <HI>Chri&s;t's Blood, Eph.</HI> 1.7. and the Pow|er of <HI>Chri&s;t's Spirit, John</HI> 8.36. there is no Delive|rance; the Lord Je&s;us having paid the Price for our Deliverance. Yet it is with us, as with a Company of Captives in Pri&s;on; our Sins like &s;trong Chains hold us; Satan, our Keeper, will not let us go, the Pri&s;on Doors, thro' <HI>Unbelief,</HI> are &s;hut upon us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.32. and thereby God and Chri&s;t are kept out from us; what Power can re&s;cue us, that are held fa&s;t under &s;uch a Power, even after the Price is paid? Truly it can be no other but that in my Text, <HI>In me is thy Help:</HI> When our Ran&s;om is paid, the Lord him&s;elf mu&s;t come and fetch us out by a &s;trong Hand, I&s;ai. 53.1. <HI>To whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</HI> Truly to very few, yet to &s;ome it is&punc; and certainly look as they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Chri&s;t no Saviour indeed, who deny

his Salvation by Price and Satisfaction; &s;o tho&s;e al&s;o make him an imperfect Saviour, who deny Salvation and actual Deliverance of Man, to be only the almigh|ty Arm and Efficacy of his Spirit and Power: Excel|lent therefore is the Speech of the Apo&s;tle, Acts 5.30, 31. <HI>God hath exalted Je&s;us to give Repentance and Re|mi&s;&s;ion of Sins unto I&s;rael;</HI> look as Je&s;us was aba&s;ed to purcha&s;e Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion, &s;o he is now ex|alted actually to give and apply Repentance and Re|mi&s;&s;ion of Sins. Who&s;e Glory is it to remit Sins, but God's in Chri&s;t, and by Chri&s;t only? Who&s;e Glory is it to give Repentance (which in this Place, compre|hends the Work of Conver&s;ion and Faith, as <HI>Bez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> ob|&s;erves) whereby we apply Remi&s;&s;ion, but the &s;ame God only? The one is as difficult to be conveyed as the other, and we &s;tand in as much need of Chri&s;t to do the one as the other; all the Power of Chri&s;t exal|ted, is little eno' to give us Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion, the Condition of the Covenant expre&s;s'd in Repen|tance, and the Ble&s;&s;ings in the Covenant, &s;ummed up in the Forgivne&s;s of Sins; the <HI>Socinians</HI> deny Redemp|tion and Salvation by Price; the <HI>Arminians,</HI> by Chri&s;t's Power, leaving Swa&s;ion only to him, but Power of Conver&s;ion to the Power and Liberty of the Will of Man; O adulterous Generation, that are thus hack|ing and cutting the Cords of their own Salvation! I &s;hall here &s;peak only to one Que&s;tion, which is the principal and mo&s;t profitable, and that is this,</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>How doth Chri&s;t redeem and &s;ave us by his Power, out of that mi&s;erable E&s;tate; and con&s;equently what is the Way for us to &s;eek, and &s;o to find and feel De|liverance by the Hand of Chri&s;t's Power?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> As there are four principal Means &amp; Cau&s;es or Ways, whereby Man ruins him&s;elf. 1. <HI>Ignorance of their own Mi&s;ery.</HI> 2. <HI>Security and Un&s;en&s;iblene&s;s of

it.</HI> 3. <HI>Carnal Confidence in their own Duties.</HI> 4. <HI>Pre|&s;umption, or re&s;ting upon the Mercy of God by a Faith of their own forging.</HI> So on the contrary, there is a four|fold Act of Chri&s;t's Power, whereby he re&s;cues and delivers all his out of their mi&s;erable E&s;tate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Act or Stroke is <HI>Conviction of Sin.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd is <HI>Compunction for Sin.</HI></P>
<P>The third is <HI>Humiliation, or Self-Aba&s;ement.</HI></P>
<P>The Fourth is <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P>All which are di&s;tinctly put forth (when he cea&s;eth extraordinarily to work) in the Day of Chri&s;t's Power; and whoever look for actual Salvation and Redemp|tion from Chri&s;t, let them &s;eek for Mercy and Deli|verance in this Way, out of which, they &s;hall never find it; let them begin at Conviction, and de&s;ire the Lord to let them &s;ee their Sins, that &s;o, being affected with them, and humbled under them, they may, by Faith, be enabled to receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o be ble&s;&s;ed in him. It is true, Chri&s;t is applied to us next|ly by Faith, but Faith is wrought in us in that Way of Conviction and Sorrow for Sin; no Man can or will come by Faith to Chri&s;t, to take away his Sins, unle&s;s he fir&s;t &s;ee, be convicted of, and laden with them. I confe&s;s the Manner of the Spirit's Work in the Conver&s;ion of a Sinner unto God, is exceeding &s;ecret, and in many Things very various; and there|fore it is too great Boldne&s;s to mark out all God's Foot&s;teps herein; yet &s;o far forth as the Lord him&s;elf tells us his Work, and the Manner of it in all his, we may &s;afely re&s;olve our &s;elves; and &s;o far, and no far|ther, &s;hall we proceed in the Explication of the&s;e Things. It is great Prophanene&s;s not to &s;earch into the Works of common Providence, tho' &s;ecret and hidden, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 28.5. and 92.6. much greater is it, not to do thus unto God's Work of e&s;pecial Favour and Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e upon his cho&s;en.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="005059_0010_1016955B40CBD798">I &s;hall therefore begin with the fir&s;t Stroke of Chri&s;t's Power, which is the <HI>Conviction of Sin.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> The fir&s;t Act of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Power; which is the <HI>Conviction of Sin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_NOW for the more di&s;tinct Explication of this, I &s;hall open to you the&s;e four Things,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I &s;hall prove, <HI>That the Lord Chri&s;t by his Spirit, begins the actual Deliverance of his Elect here.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>What is that Sin the Lord convinceth the Soul thus fir&s;t of.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>How the Lord doth it.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>What Mea&s;ure and Degree of Conviction he works thus in all his.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. <HI>For the fir&s;t,</HI> It is &s;aid, <HI>John</HI> 16.8, 9. that the fir&s;t Thing that the <HI>Spirit</HI> doth when he comes to make the Apo&s;tle's Mini&s;try effectual, is this, it &s;hall <HI>re|prove</HI> or <HI>convince the World of Sin;</HI> it doth not fir&s;t work Faith, but convinceth them that they have no Faith, as in <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 9. and con&s;equently under the Guilt and Dominion of their Sin; and after this, he <HI>convin|ceth of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which Faith apprehends, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 10. It is true, that the Word <HI>Conviction</HI> here, is of a large Extent, and includes Compunction and Hu|miliation for Sin, yet our Saviour wraps them up in this Word; becau&s;e <HI>Conviction</HI> is the fir&s;t, and there|fore the Chief in order; here the Lord is not &s;peak|ing now of ineffectual, but effectual and thoro' Con|viction, expre&s;s'd in deep Sorrow and Humiliation.
<PB N="6" REF="005059_0011_1016955CEC8F9F90">
Now the Text &s;aith, the Lord begins not thus with &s;ome one or two, but with the <HI>World</HI> of God's Elect, who are to be called home by the Mini&s;try of the Word; which our Saviour &s;peaks (as any may &s;ee who con&s;iders the Scope) purpo&s;ely to comfort the Hearts of his Di&s;ciples, that their Mini&s;try &s;hall be thus effectual to the World of Jews and Gentiles; and therefore cannot &s;peak of &s;uch <HI>Conviction</HI> as &s;erves only for to leave Men without Excu&s;e, for greater Condemnation; (as &s;ome under&s;tand the Place) for that is a poor Ground of Con&s;olation to their &s;ad Hearts. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall hereafter prove that there can be no Faith without Sen&s;e of Sin and Mi&s;ery; and now there can be no Sen&s;e of Sin without a precedent Sight or Conviction of Sin; no Man can feel Sin, unle&s;s he doth fir&s;t &s;ee it; what the Eyes &s;ee not the Heart rues not. Let the greate&s;t Evil befall a Man, &s;uppo&s;e the burning of his Hou&s;e, the Death of his Children, if he doth not fir&s;t know, &s;ee and hear of it, he will ne|ver take it to Heart, it will never trouble him; &s;o let a poor Sinner lye under the greate&s;t Guilt, the &s;o|re&s;t Wrath of God, it will never trouble him until he &s;ees it and be convinced of it, Acts 2.37. <HI>When they heard this they were pricked;</HI> but fir&s;t they heard it, and &s;aw their Sin, before their Hearts were wound|ed for it, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.7. they fir&s;t <HI>&s;aw their Nakedne&s;s,</HI> before they were <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> of it. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The main End of the Law is to drive us to Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.4. If <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be the <HI>End of the Law,</HI> then the Law is the Means &s;ub&s;ervient to that End, and that not to <HI>&s;ome,</HI> but to all <HI>that believe;</HI> now the Law tho' it drives us to Chri&s;t by Condemnation, yet in order it begins with Accu&s;ation. It fir&s;t accu&s;eth, and &s;o convinceth of Sin, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.20. and then condemneth. It's Folly and Inju&s;tice for a Judge to Condemn and bring a Sin|ner
<PB N="7" REF="005059_0012_10169560F635E248">
to Execution before Accu&s;ation and Conviction; and is it Wi&s;dom or Ju&s;tice in the Lord to do other|wi&s;e? And therefore the Spirit in making u&s;e of the Law for this End, fir&s;t convinceth, as it fir&s;t accu&s;eth and lays our Sins to our Charge. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Look as Satan when he binds up a Sinner in his Sin, he fir&s;t keeps him (if po&s;&s;ible) from the very Sight and Know|ledge of it; becau&s;e &s;o long as they &s;ee it not, this Ignorance is the Cau&s;e of all their Woe; why they feel it not, why they de&s;ire not to come out of it; the Lord Je&s;us (who came to untie the Knots of Sa|tan, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.8.) begins here, and fir&s;t convinceth his, and makes them &s;ee their Sin, that &s;o they may feel it, and come to him for Deliverance out of it. O con&s;ider this, all you that dream out your Time in minding only Things before your Feet, never think|ing on the Evils of your own Hearts; you that heed not, you that will not &s;ee your Sins, not &s;o much as a&s;k this Que&s;tion, What have I done? What do I do? How do I live? What will become of me? What will be the End of the&s;e my fooli&s;h Cour&s;es? I tell you if ever the Lord &s;ave you, he will make you &s;ee what you cannot, what you now will not; he will not only make you to confe&s;s you are Sinners, but he will convince you of Sin, this &s;hall be the fir&s;t Thing the Lord will do with thee.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. But you will &s;ay, <HI>What is that Sin which the Lord fir&s;t convinceth of?</HI> Which is the &s;econd Thing to be opened. I an&s;wer in the&s;e three Con|clu&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w. Concl.</HI> 1. The Lord Je&s;us by his Spirit doth not only convince the Soul in general, that it is a Sin|ner, and &s;inful; but the Lord brings in a convicting Evidence of the Particulars; the fir&s;t is learnt more by Tradition (in the&s;e Days) by the Report and Ac|knowledgment
<PB N="8" REF="005059_0013_10169563A723ED90">
of every Man, rather than by any &s;pe|cial Conviction of the Spirit of Chri&s;t; for what Man is there almo&s;t but lies under this Confe&s;&s;ion that he is a Sinner? the be&s;t &s;ay they are Sinners, <HI>and if we &s;ay we have no Sin, we deceive our&s;elves,</HI> and <HI>I know I am a Sinner;</HI> but that which the Spirit principally convinceth of, is &s;ome Sin or Sins in particu|lar: The Spirit doth not arre&s;t Men for Offences in general, but opens the Writ, and &s;hews them the par|ticular Cau&s;e, the particular Sins, Rom. 3.9. <HI>We have proved,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>that Jews and Gentiles are under Sin,</HI> but how doth the Apo&s;tle (being now the In&s;trument of the Spirit, in this Work of Con|viction) convince them of this? Mark his Method, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 10, to 18, wherein you &s;hall &s;ee it done by e|numeration of Particulars; Sins of their Natures, <HI>there is none Righteous;</HI> Sins of their Minds, <HI>none under&s;tand|eth;</HI> Sins in their Wills and Affections, <HI>none &s;eek after God;</HI> Sins in their Lives, <HI>all gone out of the way;</HI> Sins of Omi&s;&s;ion of good Duties, <HI>there is none that doeth good,</HI> their <HI>Throats, Tongues, Lips,</HI> are <HI>Sepulchres, de|ceitful, poi&s;onful,</HI> their <HI>Mouths full of Cur&s;ing,</HI> their <HI>Feet &s;wift to &s;hed Blood,</HI> &amp;c. And this is the State of you Jews, (<HI>ver&s;e</HI> 14.) as well as of the Gentiles, <HI>that all Fle&s;h may &s;tand convinced as guilty before God.</HI> If it be here demanded, What are tho&s;e particular Sins which the Lord convinceth Men of? I An&s;wer, In Variety of Men there is much Variety of &s;pecial Sins, as there is of Di&s;po&s;itions, Tempers and Temptations; and therefore the Lord doth not convince one Man at fir&s;t of the &s;ame Sins of which he doth another Man, yet this we may &s;afely &s;ay, u&s;ually (tho' not always) the Lord begins with the Remembrance and Con&s;ideration of &s;ome one great, if not a Man's &s;pecial and mo&s;t be|loved Sin; and thereby the Spirit di&s;covers gradually
<PB N="9" REF="005059_0014_10169566713D0AA0">
all the re&s;t: That Arrow which woundeth the Heart of Chri&s;t mo&s;t, the Lord makes it fall fir&s;t upon the Head of the Sinner that did &s;hoot it again&s;t Heaven, and convinceth, and as it were hits him fir&s;t with that: How did the Spirit convince tho&s;e 3000, tho&s;e Patterns of God's converting Grace? <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. Did not the Lord begin with them for one principal Sin, <HI>viz.</HI> their Murder and Contempt of Chri&s;t, by embruing their Hands in his Blood? There is no Que&s;tion but now they remember'd other &s;inful Practices, but this was the <HI>Imprimis,</HI> which is ever accompanied with many other <HI>Items,</HI> which are then read in God's Bill of Reckonings, where the fir&s;t is &s;et down, <HI>I&s;rael would have a King,</HI> 1 Sam. 8.19. <HI>Samuel,</HI> for a Time, could not convince them of their Sin; herein what doth the Lord do? &s;urely he will convince them of Sin, before he leaves them, and this by &s;uch terri|ble Thunder as &s;hall make their Hearts ake; and how is it now?

A Man will not be afraid of a Lion when it is painted on a Wall; why? becau&s;e therein he doth not &s;ee

the living Lion; when he &s;ees that he trembles. So Men hear of Sin, and talk of Sin and Death, and &s;ay they are mo&s;t mi&s;erable in Regard of both; yet their Hearts tremble not, are not amazed at the&s;e Evils, becau&s;e Sin is not &s;een alive, Death is not pre&s;ented alive before them, which is done by the Spirit of Con|viction only, revealing the&s;e really to the Soul: And hence it is that many Men <HI>in &s;eeing &s;ee not,</HI> (I&s;ai. 6.3.) how can that be? thus, in &s;eeing Things notionally, they &s;ee them not really. And hence many that know mo&s;t of Sin, know lea&s;t of Sin, becau&s;e in &s;eeing it notionally, they &s;ee it not really. And therefore hap|py were it for &s;ome Men, Scholars and others, that they had no notional Knowledge, for this <HI>Light</HI> is their <HI>Darkne&s;s,</HI> and makes them more uncapable of &s;piri|tual Conviction. The fir&s;t Act of &s;piritual Convic|tion is to let a Man &s;ee clearly that he is &s;inful and mo&s;t mi&s;erable; the &s;econd Act is to let the Soul &s;ee really what this Sin and Death is. O con&s;ider of this; many of you know that you are &s;inful, and that you &s;hall die; but do&s;t thou know what Sin is, and what it is to die? If thou did&s;t, I dare &s;ay thy Heart would &s;ink; if thou do&s;t not, thou art a condemned Man, becau&s;e not yet a convinced Man. If you here a&s;k, how the Lord makes Sin real; I an&s;wer, by making God real: The real Greatne&s;s of Sin is &s;een by be|holding really the Greatne&s;s of God who is &s;mitten by Sin; Sin is not &s;een becau&s;e God is not &s;een, John 3.11. <HI>He that doth Evil hath not &s;een God.</HI> No Know|ledge of God is the Cau&s;e why <HI>Blood toucheth Blood,</HI> (Ho&s;. 4.4.) the Spirit ca&s;ts out all other Company of vain and fooli&s;h Thoughts, and then God comes in and appears immediately to the Soul in his Great|ne&s;s and Glory, and then the Spirit &s;aith, Lo, this is that God thy Sins have provoked. And now Sin ap|pears
<PB N="22" REF="005059_0027_1016958998CD7108">
as it is, and together with this real Sight of Sin, the Soul doth not &s;ee painted Fire, but &s;ees the Fire of God's Wrath really, whither now it is leading, that can never be quench'd but by Chri&s;t's Blood: And when the Spirit hath thus convinced, now a Man begins to &s;ee his Madne&s;s and Folly in Times pa&s;t, &s;ay|ing, I knew not what I did. And hence Que&s;tions, Can the Lord pardon &s;uch a Wretch as I, who&s;e Sins are &s;o great? Hence al&s;o the Heart begins to be af|fected with Sin and Death, becau&s;e it &s;ees them now as they are indeed, and not by Report only. A Man accounts it a matter of Nothing to tread upon a Worm, wherein there is nothing &s;een worthy either to be loved or feared; and hence a Man's Heart is not affected with it: Before the Spirit of Conviction comes, God is more vile in Man's Eye than any Worm; as Chri&s;t &s;aid of him&s;elf in another Ca&s;e, P&s;al. 22. <HI>I am a Worm and no Man;</HI> &s;o may the Lord complain, I am viler in &s;uch a one's Eye than any Worm, and no God: And hence a Man makes it a Matter of Nothing to tread upon the glorious Maje&s;ty of God, and hence is not affected with it; but when God is &s;een by the Spirit of Conviction, in his great Glory, then as He is great, Sin is &s;een great; as his Glory affects and a&s;to|ni&s;heth the Soul, &s;o Sin affects the Heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is a con&s;tant Light; the Soul &s;ees Sin and Death continually before it; <HI>God's Arrows &s;tick fa&s;t in the Soul,</HI> and cannot be pluck'd out; <HI>my Sin is ever before me,</HI> &s;aid <HI>David,</HI> (in his renewing the Work of Conver&s;ion.) For in effectual Conviction the Mind is not only bound to &s;ee the Mi&s;ery lying upon it, but it is held bound: It is &s;uch a Sun-light as never can be quenched, tho' it may be clouded. When the Spirit of Chri&s;t darts in any Light to &s;ee Sin, the Soul would turn away from looking upon it, would
<PB N="23" REF="005059_0028_1016958FC3149EB8">
not hear on that Ear, <HI>Felix</HI>-like. But the Spirit of Conviction &s;ent to make thoro' Work on the Hearts of all the Elect, follows them, meets them at every Turn, forceth them to &s;ee and remember what they have done; the lea&s;t Sin is now a Mote in the Eye, is ever troubling. Tho&s;e gha&s;tly, dreadful Objects of Sin, Death, Wrath, being pre&s;ented by the Spirit near unto the Soul, fix the Eye to fa&s;ten here; they that can ca&s;t off at their Plea&s;ure the Remembrance and Thoughts of Sin and Death, never prove &s;ound, until the Lord make them &s;tay their Thoughts, and mu&s;e deeply on what they have done, and whither they are going. And hence the Soul in lying down, ri&s;ing up, lies down &amp; ri&s;es up with perplexed Tho'ts, What will become of me? The Lord &s;ometimes keeps it waking in the Night &s;ea&s;on, when others are a&s;leep, and then it is haunted with tho&s;e Thoughts, it cannot &s;leep; it looks back upon every Day and Week, Sabbath, Sermon, Prayer, Speeches, and thinks all this Day, this Week, &amp;c. the Goodne&s;s of the Lord and his Patience to a Wretch hath been continued; I &s;in in all I do, in all my Prayers, in all I Think, the &s;ame Heart remains &s;till not humbled, not yet changed.</P>
<P>And hence you &s;hall ob&s;erve, that Word that di&s;|covered Sin fir&s;t to it, it never goes out of the Mind; I think, &s;aith the Soul, I &s;hall never forget &s;uch a Man, nor &s;uch a Truth. Hence al&s;o if the Soul grow light and carele&s;s at &s;ome Time, and ca&s;ts off the Thoughts of the&s;e Things, the Spirit returns again, and falls a Rea&s;oning with the Soul, Why ha&s;t thou done this? What Hurt hath the Lord done thee? Will there never be an End? Ha&s;t not thou gone on long eno' in thy lewd Cour&s;es again&s;t God, but that thou &s;hould&s;t &s;till add to the Heap? Ha&s;t thou not Wrath enough upon thee already? How &s;oon may the Lord &s;top thy

And then thou knowe&s;t thou had&s;t bett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r never to have been born; Was there ever any that thus re&s;i&s;ted Grace; that thus adventured upon the Sword Point? Ha&s;t thou but one Friend, a patient, long-&s;uffering God, that hath left thy Con&s;cience with|out Excu&s;e long ago, and therefore could have cut thee off, and do&s;t thou thus for&s;ake him, thus abu&s;e him? Thus the Spirit follows; and hence the Soul comes to &s;ome Mea&s;ure of Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin: O Lord, I have done exceeding wickedly, I have been wor&s;e than the Hor&s;e that ru&s;heth into the Battle, becau&s;e it &s;ees not Death before it, but I have &s;een Death before me in the&s;e Ways, and yet go on, and &s;till Sin, and cannot but Sin: Behold me, Lord, for I am very vile. When thus the Spirit hath let into the Soul a clear, real, con&s;tant Light, to &s;ee Sin and Death, now there is a thoro' Conviction.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, In what Mea&s;ure doth the Spirit communicate this Light?</P>

<P>_COmpunction, pricking at the Heart, or Sen&s;e and Feeling of Sin, is diffe|rent from Conviction of Sin; the latter being the Work of the Under|&s;tanding, and &s;eated in that principally; the other is in the Affections and Will, and &s;ea|ted therein principally: A Man may have &s;ight of &s;in, without &s;orrow and &s;en&s;e of it, <HI>Dan.</HI> 5.22. <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.24. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.20, 21. Yet that Conviction which the Spirit works in the Elect is ever accompanied with Compunction, fir&s;t or la&s;t. For the better unfolding this Point, let me open the&s;e four Things to you.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That Compunction or Sen&s;e of Sin immediately follows Conviction of Sin in the Day of Chri&s;t's Power.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Nece&s;&s;ity of this Work to &s;ucceed the other.</ITEM>

<P N="1">1.

Is it not Compunction? For if the Lord &s;hould let a Man &s;ee his &s;in, and Death for Sin, and yet &s;uffer the Heart to remain hard and unaffec|ted, the Lord did but leave him without Excu&s;e; nay, the Lord &s;hould but leave him under greater Mi|&s;ery, and under a more fearful Judgment, <HI>viz.</HI> for a Man to &s;ee and know his &s;in, and yet unaffected with it, and hardn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d under it, Hardne&s;s of Heart is one of a greate&s;t Judgments: To &s;ee &s;in and not to be affected with it, argues greater Hardne&s;s.

What is the End of that Light the Lord lets into the Under&s;tanding in other Things? Is it not that thereby the Heart might be affected thoro'ly with it? Why doth the Lord let in the Light of the Knowledge of Chri&s;t and of his Will? Is it that this Knowledge &s;hould like Froth float in the Under|&s;tanding, and be impri&s;oned there? No verily, but that the Heart might be thoro'ly and deeply affected therewith. And do you think the Lord will in the

If any &s;ay that the End of Conviction is to drive the Soul to Chri&s;t, I grant that this is the remote and la&s;t End of it, but the next End is Compunction. For if the Under|&s;tanding be convinced of Mi&s;ery, and the Heart re|main hard, the Mind may &s;ee indeed that Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Life only is to be had in Chri&s;t; yet the Heart remaining hard, the Will and Affections will never &s;tir toward Chri&s;t, it's impo&s;&s;ible a hard Heart, remaining &s;uch, wholly unaffected with Sin or Mi&s;ery, &s;hould be truly affected with Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but of this more hereafter.</P>
<P N="2">2. What Nece&s;&s;ity is there of this Compunction to &s;econd Conviction?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I &s;peak now of Nece&s;&s;ity in way of ordinary Di&s;pen&s;ation, not of God's u&s;ual and extraordinary Way of Working, where he u&s;eth neither Law not Go&s;pel (as ordinarily he doth) to work by. Many have been nibling lately at this Doctrine, and demand|ed, What need is there of Sorrow and Compunction of Heart? A Man may be converted only by the Go&s;pel, and God may let in Sweetne&s;s and Joy with|out any &s;en&s;e of Sin or Mi&s;ery, and in nay Experience I have found if &s;o; others godly and gracious al&s;o feel it &s;o: Why therefore do any pre&s;s &s;uch a Nece&s;&s;ity of coming in at this back Door unto Chri&s;t?

<P N="1"><PB N="37" REF="005059_0042_101695B61D9AF2F0">1. <HI>Rule.</HI> In this Work of Compunction, do not think that the Lord hath not wro't any true &s;en&s;e of &s;in, becau&s;e you find it not in &s;uch a Mea&s;ure as you imagine you &s;hould de&s;ire to have, and that others feel; &s;en&s;e of &s;in admits Degrees.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Rule.</HI> Do not think there is no Compunction or Sen&s;e of Sin wro't in the Soul, becau&s;e you cannot &s;o clearly di&s;cern and feel it, nor the Time of the Working and fir&s;t Beginning of it. I have known many that have come with Complaints, they were never humbled, they never felt it &s;o, nor yet could tell the Time when it was &s;o, yet there hath been &amp; many Times they have &s;een it by the Help of other Spectacles, and ble&s;t God for it.

Yes verily, but they felt nothing but a hard Heart, nay, &s;uch Hardne&s;s as if the Lord had plagued them with it by his own immediate Hand, and not born and bred with them only, as with other Men. Many a Soul may think the Lord hath left it, nay, &s;mitten it with a hard Heart, and &s;o make his Moan of it, yet the Lord hath wro't real Softne&s;s under felt Hardne&s;s, as many Times in Roprobates there is felt Softne&s;s, when within there is real Hardne&s;s. The &s;tony-ground Hearers were plow|ed and broken on the Top, but were &s;tony at the Bot|tom. Some Men may be wounded outwardly and mor|tally, this may ea&s;ily be di&s;cerned.

<P>We are not in this or any other Point to be guided by the Experience of Men only, but attend the Rule; if it be proved, that according unto the Rule Men mu&s;t be broken and affected with their &s;in and Mi&s;e|ry before Mercy can be truly apprehended or Chri&s;t accepted; What tell you me of &s;uch or &s;uch Men? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et the Rule &s;tand; but let Men &s;tand or fall accor|ding

<P>What is the Rea&s;on?</P>
<P>Truly the Cau&s;e was here, their fir&s;t Wound and Sorrow for Sin was not right, as hereafter &s;hall be made good; many Thou&s;ands are mi&s;erably deceived about their E&s;tates by this one Thing, of crooking and wre&s;ting God's Rules to Chri&s;tians Experience; let all God's Servants tremble and be wary here; wrack not the holy Scriptures, nor force them to &s;peak as thou feele&s;t, but try all Things by them, 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.21.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Rule.</HI> Do not make the Examples of converted Per&s;ons in Scripture Patterns in all Things of Per&s;ons unconverted: Do not make God's Work upon the one, run Parallel with God's Work upon the other.</P>

Now &s;o long as he takes Plea&s;ure in Sin, and finds Contentment by Sin, be cannot but cleave in&s;eparably to it: Oh 'tis &s;weet, and it only is &s;weet; for &s;o long the Soul is dead in Sin. <HI>Plea&s;ure in Sin is Death in Sin,</HI> 1 Tim. 5.6.

No, the Lord abhors &s;uch whori&s;h wiping the Lips; and therefore the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, (1 Cor. 5.2.) when he reproves them for not &s;eparating the Sinner, and &s;o the Sin from them, he &s;ums it up in one Word, <HI>You have not mourned, that &s;uch a one might be taken from you:</HI> Becau&s;e then Sin is &s;evered truly from the Soul, when Sorrow or Shame, from Sen&s;e and Feeling of the Evil of it, be|gins it. Not only Sin is oppo&s;ite to God, but when the Lord Je&s;us fir&s;t comes near his Elect in their &s;in|ful E&s;tate, they are then Enemies them&s;elves by Sin unto God. And hence it is they will never part with their Weapons, until them&s;elves be thoroughly Wounded: And therefore the Lord mu&s;t wound their Con&s;ciences, Minds and Hearts, before they will ca&s;t them by. Now if there be no parting with, no Separation from Sin, but Sin is as &s;trong, and the Sinner as vile as ever before, hath Chri&s;t (who now comes to &s;ave his Elect from Sin) the End of his Work? What is the Man the better for Conviction, Affection to Chri&s;t, name what you can, that remains &s;till in his Sins? When the Apo&s;tle would &s;um up all the Mi&s;ery of Men, he doth it in tho&s;e Words, (1 Cor. 15.17.) <HI>Ye are yet in your Sins:</HI> So I &s;ay, thou art convicted, but art yet in thy Sin; art affect with Chri&s;t, and take&s;t hold of Chri&s;t, but art yet in thy Sin; <HI>he that confe&s;&s;eth and for&s;aketh his Sin, &s;hall find Mercy.</HI></P>

<P>And hence it is, that when the Lord called his Peo|ple to him, yet they would <HI>not come to him (Jer.</HI> 2.31.) becau&s;e they were <HI>Lords,</HI> and well eno' without him.

<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 4. This may la&s;tly appear, by con&s;idering the End of Man's Fall into &s;in, and the publi&s;hing of the Law to reveal &s;in; and of the Go&s;pel al&s;o in Re|ference unto Sin and Mi&s;ery; why did the Lord &s;uf|fer the Fall of Man? What was his great Plot in it? It is apparent this, that thereby Way might be made for the greater Manife&s;tation of God's Grace in Chri&s;t. The Serpent poi&s;ons all Mankind, that the Seed of the Woman might have the Glory of recovering &s;ome: This was God's la&s;t End: The Perdition of &s;ome (of them&s;elves) being but &s;ubordinate unto this, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.22, 23. Surely <HI>Adam</HI> might have glorified Grace if he had &s;tood, and God had revealed his Grace in pre&s;erving him (made mutable) from falling. But the Lord &s;aw Grace &s;hould not be &s;ufficiently advan|ced to its highe&s;t Dignity by this, and therefore &s;uffers him actually to fall, and that into an extream Depth of Mi&s;ery. Now con&s;ider, Man's Fall in it &s;elf can|not be a Mean of glorifying Grace, but rather ob|&s;cures all the Glory of God; how &s;hall the Lord at|tain his End then hereby? Truly if the Lord let Men &s;ee and feel their Fall and Mi&s;ery by it, now Grace offered will be accepted and glorified. And there|fore the Lord &s;ends the Law to reveal &s;in, and make it exceeding &s;inful; and Death for &s;in that this End might be attained, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.22. And therefore feel|ing of Sin and Death and Mi&s;ery being the Means, mu&s;t precede the other as the End; and therefore as Grace may be &s;een by Conviction of Mi&s;ery, &s;o the Sweetne&s;s of it only can be felt by feeling Mi&s;ery in this Work of Compunction.</P>

<P><PB N="50" REF="005059_0055_101695DBD4C91B20">The Lord Chri&s;t therefore lets in this Fear, that look as the Lord when he came to conquer the <HI>Ca|naanites,</HI> Exod. 23.27, 28. <HI>He &s;ent his Hornets before him,</HI> which were certain Fears, which made their Hearts faint in the Day of Battle, and by this &s;ubdued them; &s;o the Lord Chri&s;t when he comes to conquer a poor &s;inner that hath long re&s;i&s;ted him, and would go on to his own Perdition, lets in the&s;e Fears, that the Soul &s;hrinks in with the Thoughts of its woful E|&s;tate, and crys out &s;ecretly, Lord what will become of me, If I die in this Condition? <HI>Paul</HI> (Acts 3.6.) trembles a&s;toni&s;hed at his Mi&s;ery and Wickedne&s;s, and now he cries out; the Jaylor was very cruel a|gain&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI> (Acts 16.) but when the Lord Je&s;us comes to re&s;cue him from this Condition, you &s;hall &s;ee him trembling. The Lord hath let in that Fear, that now he is content to do any Thing to be &s;aved from the Danger he &s;aw he was now in; when a Man &s;ees Danger and great Danger near and imminent, now Man naturally fears it: Before Chri&s;t come, the Soul may &s;ee its Mi&s;ery, but apprehends it far off, and hoping to e&s;cape it, and hence doth not tear it; but when the Lord Je&s;us comes, he pre&s;ents a Man's Danger, Death, Wrath, and Eternity near unto him, and hence hath no Hope to e&s;cape it, as now he is, and therefore doth fear; and &s;eeing the Mi&s;ery exceeding great, he hath an exceeding great (tho' oft-times deep) Fear of it; as Men near Death, and apprehending it &s;o, begin then to be troubled, and cry out when it is too late. The Lord Je&s;us deals more mercifully with the Elect, and brings Death and Eternity near them before they draw near to it; whiles it is called to Day: The poor Jaylor began to think of killing him|&s;elf when Fears were upon him, (<HI>Acts</HI> 16.) and &s;o many under this &s;troke of Chri&s;t, have the &s;ame Tho'ts,

<P N="1">1. That the&s;e Fears are not meerly natural, (as tho&s;e, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.15.) ari&s;ing from natural Con&s;cience only, which only accu&s;e of Sin, but never affect? but

they are &s;upernatural, they are Arrows &s;hot into the Con&s;cience by the Arm of the Spirit; &s;o dreadful that no Word nor Meditation of Death and Eternity can beget &s;uch Fears, but creates them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence it follows, that they are clear Fears, (for the Spirit's Work is ever clear before he leaves it, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.13.) they are not blind confu&s;ed Fears, and &s;u&s;|picious and &s;ad Conjectures, whereby many a Man is afraid and much afraid and affrighted like Men in a Dream, that think they are in Hell, yet cannot tell what that Evil is which they fear; but they are clear Fears whereby they di&s;tinctly know and &s;ee that they are mi&s;erable, and what that Mi&s;ery is.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it follows that they are &s;trong Fears, be|cau&s;e the almighty Hand of the Spirit &s;ets them on, and &s;hakes the Soul; they are not weak Fears which a Man can &s;hake off, or cure by weak Hopes, Sleep or Bu&s;ine&s;s, &amp;c. like &s;ome Winds that &s;hake the Tree, but never blow it down: But the&s;e Fears ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> down the talle&s;t Cedar, and appall the Heart, and cool the Courage and Boldne&s;s of the mo&s;t impenitent and audacious Sinner.

A Man like <HI>Lot</HI> lingers in his Sin, but the&s;e Fears like the Angel drive him violently out, the Lord &s;aying to him, Away for thy Life, le&s;t thou peri&s;h with the World, for thy &s;ins are come up to Heaven, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> maye&s;t die before one Day be at an End, and their what will become of thee?

And hence you &s;hall ob&s;erve, if the Soul after &s;ad Fears grows bold and carele&s;s again, the Spirit pur&s;ues it with more Cau&s;e of Fear, and now the Soul crys out, Did the Lord ever elect thee?

Thou ha&s;t &s;inned again&s;t Con&s;cience, after thou ha&s;t been enlightned, and fallen back again, ha&s;t thou not therefore committed the unpardonable Sin? Thou ha&s;t had many a fair Sea&s;on of &s;eeking God, but ha&s;t dallied and dream'd away thy Time; is not the Day of Grace therefore now pa&s;t? It is true, the Lord is yet patient and bountiful, and lets thee live on com|mon Mercy, but is not all this to aggravate thy Con|demnation again&s;t that great and dreadful Day of the Lord which is at Hand? Are there not better Men in Hell then thou art that never committed the like &s;in? Thus the Spirit pur&s;ues with &s;trong Fears, till proud Man falls down to the Du&s;t before God. The Soul is now under Fears, not above them; and there|fore cannot come out of the&s;e Chains, by the mo&s;t comfortable Doctrine it hears, nor particular Appli|cation of it by the mo&s;t merciful Mini&s;ters in the World, until the Lord &s;ay, as Lam. 3, 57. <HI>Fear not;</HI> the Lord only can a&s;&s;wage the&s;e &s;trong Winds, and raging Waters, in which there is no other Cry heard of this Soul thus to&s;&s;ed with Tempe&s;ts, but O I peri&s;h? Only the Lord making Way for the Spirit of Adop|tion by the&s;e in his Elect; drives them out to &s;eek if there be any Hope, and &s;o they are not properly de&s;perate Fears, yet as I &s;ay, &s;trong Fears, not alike exten&s;ively, yet alike inten&s;ively &s;trong in all; a &s;mall Evil when Tidings is bro't of it he doth not fear, but if

the Evil be apprehended great and near too, the very Su&s;picion of it makes the Heart tremble; when a Hou&s;e is on Fire, or a mighty Army entred the Land and near the City, Children that know not the Great|ne&s;s of the Evil fear them not; but Men that know the Danger are full of Fear. The Wrath of the Lord that fire tho&s;e Armies of everla&s;ting Woes, are great Evils, the blind World may not much fear them, but all the Elect who&s;e Minds are convinced to &s;ee the Greatne&s;s of them, cannot but Fear, and that with &s;trong and con&s;tant Fears; nor is it Cowar|dice, but Duty, to fear the&s;e <HI>everla&s;ting Burnings.</HI> And hence the Soul in this Ca&s;e wonders at the Se|curity of the World, dreads the Terrors of the Lord that are near them, and u&s;ually &s;eeks to awaken all its poor Friends. I once tho't my &s;elf well, and was quiet as you be, but the Lord hath let me &s;ee my Wo, which I cannot but fear; O look you to it.</P>
<P>Thus the Lord works this Fear in &s;ome in a grea|ter, in others in a le&s;&s;er Mea&s;ure. O con&s;ider whe|ther the Lord hath thus affected your Hearts with fear; Oh, &s;ecure Times what will God do with us! Many of you having heard the Voice of the Lion roar|ing, and yet you tremble not. The Lord hath fore|told you of Death and eternal Wo for the lea&s;t &s;in, do you believe it, and yet fear it not? How art thou then for&s;aken of God? Many of you that like old Marriners can laugh at all foul Weather, and like Weather-Cocks &s;et your Faces again&s;t all Winds; and if you be damned at la&s;t you cannot help it, you mu&s;t bear it as well as you can, you hope to do it as well as others &s;hall do: Oh! how far are &s;uch from the Kingdom of God, the Lord not yet working nor pricking thy Heart &s;o much as with Fear?</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="55" REF="005059_0060_101695EC851B6750">2. Sorrow and Mourning for Sin is the &s;econd Thing wherein Compunction con&s;i&s;ts. And look as Fear plucks the Soul from Security in &s;eeing no Evil to come; to Sorrow takes off the pre&s;ent Plea&s;ure and Delight in &s;in, in a greater Mea&s;ure than Fear doth. The Lord therefore having &s;mitten the Soul, or &s;hot the Arrows of Fear into the Soul; it there|fore grows exceeding &s;ad and heavy, thinking within it &s;elf, What good do Wife or Children, Hou&s;e or Lands, Peace and Friends, Health and Re&s;t do me? in the mean Time, condemned to die, and that eter|nally; it may be reprobated, never to &s;ee God's Face more: The Guilt and Power of &s;in in Heart and Life living &s;till upon me? And hereupon the Soul mourns in the Day, and in the Night, de&s;ires to go alone and weep; and there confe&s;&s;eth its Vilene&s;s before God, all the Days of Vanity, and Sins of Ignorance, think|ing, Oh what have I done! and &s;eeks for Mercy, but not one &s;mile, nothing but Clouds of Anger appear; and then thinks, if this Anger, the Fruit of my Sin, be &s;o great, Oh what are my Sins, the Cau&s;e hereof! When the Angel had &s;et out the Sin of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in making a League with the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> (Judges 2.1.) and told them that they &s;hould be <HI>Thorns in their Sides,</HI> they <HI>&s;at down,</HI> (Ver&s;e 4.) <HI>and lift up their Voice, and wept:</HI> &s;o 'tis with a contrite &s;inner. Note nar|rowly that eminent Place of Scripture, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 61.3. the Lord Chri&s;t is &s;ent <HI>to appoint Beauty for A&s;hes, and the Oil of Joy for the Spirit of Heavine&s;s to them that mourn.</HI> Out of which Note the&s;e four Things for the Explication of this Sorrow or Mourning.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It is &s;uch a Mourning as is precedent unto &s;piritual Joy. And hence it is not &s;aid, I will give the Spirit of Gladne&s;s to beget Mourning, (tho' the Lord doth &s;o after Conver&s;ion) but this goes in order before that. <HI>Ephraim</HI> like, who &s;eeing what an <HI>un|ruly

Bea&s;t</HI> he had been, <HI>unaccu&s;tomed to God's Yoke, &s;mites upon his Thigh,</HI> and <HI>bemoans</HI> him&s;elf, (Jer. 31.18.) It is God's Method (after his Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">le have &s;in|ned) to &s;ad their Hearts, and then to turn Mourning into Joy; much more at fir&s;t Beginning of God's Work upon the Soul, they &s;hall fir&s;t mourn, and la|ment, and &s;mite upon the Thigh: If God wounds the Soul for &s;in, it &s;hall &s;mart, and bleed too, before God will heal.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is a great Mourning, becau&s;e it is called <HI>a Spirit of Mourning,</HI> Ho&s;. 6.1, 2. As a <HI>Spirit of Slumber</HI> is a deep Slumber. When the poor Jews &s;hall be conver|ted, their great Sin &s;hall then be pre&s;ented before them, of cur&s;ing and crucifying the Lord of Life; as it was to tho&s;e, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.36. And by rea&s;on of this, there &s;hall be <HI>a great Mourning,</HI> Zech. 12.11. that they &s;hall de&s;ire to go alone in &s;ecret <HI>every one apart,</HI> and take their Fill of Mourning, before the Lord <HI>open the Fountain of Grace,</HI> Chap. 13.1. It is not a Summer Cloud, or an <HI>April</HI> Shower, that is &s;oon &s;pent, but a great Mourning. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Before this Spirit of Sorrow comes, a Man's Heart takes great delight in his &s;in, 'tis his God, his Life, and &s;weeter than Chri&s;t, and all the Joys of Hea|ven; and therefore there mu&s;t be great Sorrow, &s;in mu&s;t be made exceeding bitter. A Man that is very hungry and thir&s;ty after his Lu&s;t, mu&s;t find &s;uch Meat and Drink exceeding bitter, el&s;e he will feed on it. <HI>Solomon</HI> took great Content in Women, but what &s;aith he when the Lord humbled him? <HI>I find a Wo|man more bitter than Death,</HI> Eccl. 7.26. Hear this you Harlots, and you that live in your wanton Lu&s;ts, the Lord will make your &s;weet Mor&s;els more bitter than Death to you, if the Lord &s;aves you.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e the greate&s;t Evils are the Objects of this Sorrow, <HI>viz.</HI> Sin and Death. It is true, a Man may mourn for &s;maller Evils &s;ooner; but when the Spirit
<PB N="57" REF="005059_0062_101695F0B6F89608">
&s;ets on the greate&s;t Evils, then they &s;ad much more. <HI>Mine Iniquities are too heavy to bear,</HI> P&s;al. 38.1, 2. Why &s;o? Many a Man can bear them without &s;inking. True, but in the Elect the Spirit &s;ets on, loads the Soul herewith, <HI>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</HI> Prov. 18.14. Becau&s;e the greate&s;t Evils lye upon the mo&s;t tender Part of a tender Soul, pre&s;&s;ed down by the omnipotent Hand of Chri&s;t's Spirit: For now the Multitude of &s;ins more than the <HI>Hairs on the Head,</HI> (P&s;al. 32.2, 3. and 40.12.) come now to Mind; as al&s;o the long Continuance in them, Cradle &s;ins. No &s;ooner, &s;aith the Soul, did I begin to live, but I began to &s;in. Ob&s;tinacy al&s;o in them lies very heavy; I have had Warnings, Checks, Re&s;olutions again&s;t them, and yet have gone on, (<HI>Jer.</HI> 31.19.) The Power of &s;in al&s;o &s;ads it; that it is &s;aid, Prov. 21.9. <HI>When the Wicked reign, the People mourn;</HI> &s;o doth the Soul when it feels &s;in reign. I cannot &s;ubdue it, nay, the Lord will not, that I fear, the Lord hath left me over to it. The Increa&s;e of Sin it feels, makes it mourn al&s;o (<HI>Dan.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.12.) I grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, &s;aith the Soul; the Leak comes in fa&s;ter than he can ca&s;t it out. The Greatne&s;s of &s;in makes it mourn: Was there ever &s;uch a Sinner as I? And la&s;tly, the Sen&s;e of Condemnation for &s;in lies upon him; this is the Fruit of your evil Ways, &s;aith the Spirit, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. <HI>ult.</HI> The Soul doth not let &s;in pa&s;s by it now as Water down the Mill, but being &s;top'd by Conviction and fear of the Evil of it, it &s;wells high, and fills the Heart full of Grief and Sorrow, that ma|ny Times it is overwhelmed therewith.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e Chri&s;t will not be very &s;weet, unle&s;s this Mourning under Mi&s;ery be very great; the healing of a cut Finger is &s;weet, but of a mortal Wound is exceeding &s;weet; a little Sorrow will
<PB N="58" REF="005059_0063_101695F246E8EBC0">
make Chri&s;t &s;weet, but great &s;orrow under &s;en&s;e of deadly Wounds is exceeding &s;weet; and without this Chri&s;t hath not his Honour due to him, if he be not only &s;weet, but al&s;o exceeding &s;weet and precious.</P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e it is &s;uch a &s;orrow, as nothing but that that hath wounded the Soul can heal it. Let Men have the greate&s;t outward Troubles, outward Things can cure them; or el&s;e they will wear away. As if a Man be &s;ick, or in debt, Phy&s;ick and Money can cure the&s;e; but this Wound, neither can, or ever &s;hall be healed but by the Hand that wounded it, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 6.1, 2, 3. And hence a Man can take no Com|fort in Meat, Drink, Sleep, Friends, Mirth, nor Pa&s;time, while this Wound, this Sorrow la&s;ts; for if any Thing el&s;e can heal it, it is not the right Wound or Sorrow the Lord breeds in his Elect. An adulte|rous Heart indeed may be quieted with other Lovers; <HI>Cain</HI> can build away his Sorrow: Nay, I'll &s;ay more, this wounded Soul cannot comfort it &s;elf by any Pro|mi&s;es, till the Lord come: <HI>David</HI> had a Promi&s;e of Pardon from <HI>Nathan,</HI> yet he cries out to the Lord <HI>to make him hear the Voice of Joy and Gladne&s;s, that his broken Bones might rejoice,</HI> P&s;al. 51.8. Did not the Lord make him hear the Voice of Joy by <HI>Nathan:</HI> Yes, outwardly; but the Lord that had broke his Bones, mu&s;t make him hear inwardly. Nay, when the Lord comes him&s;elf to comfort, much ado the Lord hath to make him hear it; as the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> that <HI>hearkened not unto Mo&s;es's Voice becau&s;e of their hard Bondage,</HI> that unle&s;s the Lord did invincibly Comfort, it would lie bleeding to Death, and never live. It mu&s;t needs therefore be great Sorrow, which all the World, Men nor Angels can remove.</P>

great Mourning, if the Soul will not be &s;orrowful: As, &s;ometimes great Afflictions; <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> mu&s;t be taken in the Bu&s;hes, and be ca&s;t into Chains, (2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 53.11, 12.) Sometimes &s;trange Temptations, helli&s;h Bla&s;phemies, Is there a God? Are the Scriptures his Word? Why &s;hould the Lord be &s;o cruel as to Re|probate any of his Creatures, to torment it &s;o long, &amp;c. Sometimes long Eclip&s;ing of the Light of God's Countenance; no Prayers an&s;wered, but daily Bills of Indictment. And &s;ometimes it thinks it hears and feels a &s;ecret Te&s;timony from God, that he never had a thought of Peace toward it, and that his Purpo&s;e is immutable. Sometimes it que&s;tions, Can God for|give &s;ins &s;o great? Can it &s;tand with his Honour to put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ud &s;o much Wrong? Sometimes it feels its Heart &s;o extream hard and dedolent, that it thinks the Lord hath &s;ealed it up under this Plague till the Judgment of the great Day. And &s;ometimes the Lord makes Melancholy a good Servant to him to further this Work of &s;orrow. But thus the Lord rebukes many a hard-hearted &s;inner, that will not bear the Yoke, nor feel the Load; and now the Lord turns the Beauty of the proude&s;t into A&s;hes, and withers the Glory of all Fle&s;h. Nay, &s;ometimes you &s;hall ob&s;erve the Lord tho' he comes not out as a <HI>Lion</HI> to rend, yet as a <HI>Moth</HI> he frets out by &s;ecret pinings and langui&s;hings, the &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;ecurity of Man, that he &s;hall mourn to pur|po&s;e before he leave him. I do not mean by this, as if all Men had the like Mea&s;ure of &s;orrow; but a great &s;orrow it is in all. Every Child is delivered by &s;ome Throws; tho&s;e that &s;tick long in the Birth may feel them longer and very many.</P>

<P>Thirdly, It is a con&s;tant Mourning, for &s;o it is here called, <HI>a Spirit of Heavine&s;s;</HI> as that Woman that had a Spirit of Infirmity, and was bowed down many Years: <HI>Hannah</HI> con&s;tantly troubled, is called, <HI>a Wo|man of a &s;orrowful Spirit,</HI> 1 Sam. 1.12, 15. As <HI>the Spirit of Pride and Whoredom,</HI> Ho&s;. 4.12. is a con|&s;tant Frame, where tho' the Acts be &s;ometime &s;u&s;pend|ed, yet the Spirit remains; &s;o <HI>a Spirit of Mourning,</HI> &s;uch &s;orrow, as tho' the Acts of Mourning be &s;ome|time hindred, yet the &s;pirit and &s;pring remains; Hy|pocrites will mourn under Sin and Mi&s;ery, but what is it?

Oh how many have Pangs and Gripes of Sorrow, and can quickly ea&s;e them&s;elves again! the&s;e Mourners come to nothing in the Conclu&s;ion: I grant the &s;orrow and &s;adne&s;s of Spirit may be interrupted, but it returns a|gain, and never leaves the Soul until the Lord look down from Heaven. <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.48, 40, 50. The Cau&s;e continues, guilt and &s;trength of &s;in, and there|fore this Effect contiues.</P>
<P>Fourthly, It is &s;uch a Sorrow as makes Way for Gladne&s;s, for &s;o it is here &s;aid, <HI>the Lord gives Beauty for</HI> the&s;e <HI>A&s;hes,</HI> and hence it is no de&s;perate helli&s;h Sorrow, but u&s;ually mixt with &s;en&s;e of &s;ome Mercy, at lea&s;t common, and &s;ome Hope; not that which ap|prehends the Object of Hope particularly (which is done in Vocation) but that the Lord may find out &s;ome way of &s;aying it, <HI>Jonah</HI> 3.9. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. which

I know it is in a greater Mea&s;ure, and from &s;ome other Grounds after the Soul is in Chri&s;t; but this Sorrow there is for Sub&s;tance, mentioned for the Rea&s;ons gi|ven; if Chri&s;t hate you, you &s;hall mourn, but never till it be too late; if he love you, you mu&s;t mourn now; how great and many are many of your &s;ins, how near is your Doom?

What is the End of the Mother in laying Wormwood and Gall upon her Brea&s;t, but that the Child by ta&s;ting the Bitterne&s;s of it might be weaned and have his Stomach and Will turned from it? What is the End of fear and &s;orrow, but by this to turn away the Soul from &s;in? This Point is weighty and full of Difficulty, of great U&s;e, and worthy of deep Meditation, (<HI>Job</HI> 33.15, 16, 17.) For as the fir&s;t Wound and &s;troke of the Spirit is, &s;o it is in all

It is the great Fault of many Chri&s;tians, either their Wounds and Sorrows are &s;o little, they de&s;ire not to be healed; or if they do, they labour to heal them&s;elves fir&s;t, before they come to the Phy&s;ician for it; they will fir&s;t make them&s;elves holy, and put on their Jewels, and then believe in Chri&s;t. And hence are tho&s;e many Complaints, What have I to do with Chri&s;t? Why &s;hould he have to do with me that have &s;uch an unholy, vile, hard, blind, and mo&s;t wicked Heart? If I were more humbled, and more holy, then I would go to him, and think he would come to me. O for the Lord's &s;ake di&s;honour not the Grace of Chri&s;t. It is true, thou can&s;t not come to Chri&s;t, till thou art loaden, and humbled, and &s;eparated from thy &s;in. Thou can&s;t not be in|graffed into this Olive, unle&s;s thou be cut, and cut off too from the old Root&punc; Yet remember for ever, that no more &s;orrow for &s;in, no more &s;eparation from &s;in is nece&s;&s;ary to thy Clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, than &s;o much as makes thee willing, or rather not unwilling

that the Lord &s;hould take it away. And know it, if thou &s;eeke&s;t for a greater Mea&s;ure of Humiliation an|tecedent to thy Clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t than this, thou &s;hewe&s;t the more Pride therein, who wilt rather go into thy &s;elf to make thy &s;elf holy and humble, that thou mighte&s;t be worthy of Chri&s;t, than go out of thy &s;elf, unto the Lord Je&s;us, to take thy &s;in away. In a Word, who thinke&s;t Chri&s;t cannot love thee, until thou make&s;t thy &s;elf fair, and when thou thinke&s;t thy &s;elf &s;o (which is Pride) wilt then think otherwi&s;e of Chri&s;t. The Lord therefore when he teacheth his People how to return unto him after grievous Sins, directs them to this Cour&s;e, not to go about the Bu&s;h to remove their Iniquities them&s;elves, or to &s;tay and live &s;ecurely in their &s;ins, until the Lord did it him|&s;elf; but bids them come to him and &s;ay, <HI>Take away Lord) all Iniquities,</HI> Ho&s;. 14.1, 2, 3. You &s;hall &s;ee <HI>Ephraim bemoaning him&s;elf,</HI> Jer. 31.18. But how? Doth he &s;ay he feels his &s;ins now all remov'd? No, but he de&s;ires the Lord <HI>to turn him,</HI> and then (&s;aith he) <HI>I &s;hall be turned.</HI></P>
<P>As if he &s;hould &s;ay, Lord, I &s;hall never turn from this &s;tubborn vile Heart, nor &s;o much as turn to thee, to take it away, unle&s;s thou do&s;t turn to me, and then I &s;hall be turned to purpo&s;e.

They might object and &s;ay, Alas, the Lord is our Enemy, and wounds us, and hath broken us to Pieces, we are not yet healed, but lie dead as well as wounded; &s;hall &s;uch dead Spirits live? Mark what follows, True indeed, <HI>he hath wounded us,</HI> let us therefore go to him, that he may <HI>heal</HI> us, and <HI>af|ter two Days he will revive us.</HI> The Lord requires no more of us than thus to come to him.

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Moral.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Phy&s;ical.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>As in the Conver&s;ion of the &s;oul by Faith unto God, the Spirit is not only a moral Agent per&s;wading, but al&s;o a &s;upernatural Agent, phy&s;ically working the Heart to believe, by a divine and immediate Act; &s;o in the Aver&s;ion of the &s;oul from &s;in, the Spirit doth affect the Heart with fear and &s;orrow morally, but this can never take away &s;in, as we &s;ee in <HI>Judas</HI> and <HI>Cain</HI> deeply affected and afflicted in Spirit, and yet in their &s;in. And therefore the Spirit puts forth its own Hand phy&s;ically or immediately, and his own Arm brings Salvation to us, by a further &s;ecret immediate Stroke, turning the iron Neck, cutting the iron &s;innews of &s;in, and &s;o makes the Di&s;union or Separation. You think it is ea&s;y to be willing that Chri&s;t &s;hould come and take away all your &s;ins; I tell you the omnipo|tent Arm of the Lord that in&s;tructed <HI>Jeremy</HI> in a

&s;maller Matter, can only in&s;truct you here; both the&s;e Acts ever go together, according to the Mea&s;ure mentioned; the latter cannot be without the fir&s;t, the fir&s;t is in vain without the latter.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>But what Evil in Sin doth the Spirit morally affect the Heart with, and &s;o phy&s;ically turn it from Sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> He affects the &s;oul with it as the greate&s;t Evil: by <HI>Sin</HI> I mean not as con&s;idered without <HI>Death,</HI> (for at this Time the Soul is not &s;o &s;piritual, as that <HI>Sin,</HI> without Con&s;ideration of <HI>Death,</HI> and the Wrath due to it &s;hould affect it) but Sin and Death, &s;in arm|ed with Wrath, &s;in working Death, pricks the Heart as the greate&s;t Evil, and &s;o lets out that Core at the Bottom, as may fit the Soul for healing.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. If the Spirit make a Man feel &s;in truly, the Soul feels it as it is; it is not the Name and Talk of the Danger of &s;in that trouble it, but the Spirit (ever making Things real) loads the Soul with it indeed, and as it is; now it is the greate&s;t Evil, and therefore &s;o it feels &s;in. Believe it, you never felt &s;in indeed as it is, if you have not felt it thus.</P>
<P N="2">2. El&s;e no Man will prize Chri&s;t as the greate&s;t Good, without which no Man &s;hall have him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.37.</P>
<P N="3">3. El&s;e a Man will live and continue in &s;in. If &s;in had been a greater Evil to <HI>Pilate</HI> than the Lo&s;s of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Friend&s;hip, he would never have crucified Chri&s;t. If &s;in had been a greater Evil to <HI>Jehu</HI> than the Lo&s;s of his Kingdom, he had never kept up the two Calves. If &s;in were a greater Evil than Poverty, Shame, Grief in this World, many a Profe&s;&s;or would never lo&s;e Chri&s;t and a good Con&s;cience too, for a lit|tle Gain, Profit or Honour. Beloved, the great Cur&s;e and Wrath of the Lord upon all Men in the
<PB N="68" REF="005059_0073_1016960D173CEDC8">
World almo&s;t is this, that the greate&s;t Evils &s;hould be the lea&s;t of all felt; and the &s;malle&s;t Evils mo&s;t of all complained of. What is Death that only &s;epa|rates thy Soul from thy Body, to &s;in that &s;eparates God ble&s;&s;ed for ever from thy Soul? (<HI>Acts</HI> 3.16.) And therefore the Lord Je&s;us will remove this Cur&s;e from whom he &s;aves.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. But you will &s;ay, <HI>What is that Evil the Soul &s;ees at this Time, that thus affects the Heart with it, as the greate&s;t Evil?</HI> This is the la&s;t Difficulty here.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> There is a threefold Evil e&s;pecially &s;een in &s;in:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Evil of Torment and Angui&s;h.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Evil of Wrong and Injury to God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Evil of Separation of the Soul from God.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The fir&s;t may affect Reprobates, as <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Judas,</HI> who were &s;ore di&s;tre&s;&s;ed when they felt the Angui&s;h of Con&s;cience by &s;in.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is only in tho&s;e who are actually ju&s;ti|fied, called, and &s;anctified, who lament &s;in as it is a|gain&s;t God, and a God reconciled to them, and as it is again&s;t the Life of God begun in them; and hence they cry out of it as <HI>a Body of Death.</HI></P>
<P>The third, the Elect feel at this fir&s;t &s;troke and wound which the Spirit gives them; the Angui&s;h of &s;in indeed lies &s;ore upon them, but this <HI>much more. Chri&s;t is come to &s;eek that which is lo&s;t,</HI> Luke 15.7. The Sheep is lo&s;t, when, fir&s;t, it is &s;eparated and gone from the Owner; &s;econdly, when it knows not how to return again, unle&s;s the Shepherd find it and carry it home: &s;o that Soul is properly and truly lo&s;t, that feels it &s;elf &s;eparated and gone from God, knowing not how to return to him again, unle&s;s the Lord come and take it upon his &s;houlders, and carry it in his Arms: This lies heavy upon it, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is
<PB N="69" REF="005059_0074_1016960FCE83CE18">
gone from God, and wholly &s;eparated from all Union to him, and Communion with him. You may ob|&s;erve, John 16.9. that <HI>the Spirit convinces of Sin;</HI> how? <HI>becau&s;e they believe not in me,</HI> i. e. Becau&s;e they &s;hall &s;ee and feel them&s;elves quite &s;eparated from me; they &s;hall hear of my Glory and Riches of Mercy, and that Happine&s;s which all that have me, &s;hall and do enjoy; but they &s;hall mourn that they have no Part nor Portion in the&s;e Things; they &s;hall mourn that they live without me, and that they have lived &s;o long without me.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s many other Con&s;iderations of the Evil of &s;in now come in, but this is the main Channel where all the other Rivulets empty them&s;elves. And hence it is that the Soul under this &s;troke is in a &s;tate of &s;eeking only, yet finds nothing; it &s;eeks God and Chri&s;t, and therefore feels a Want, a Lo&s;s of both by &s;in; for the End of all the Fears, Terrors, Sor|rows, &amp;c. upon the Elect, is to bring them back a|gain to God, and into Fellow&s;hip with God, the only Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of Man. Now if the Soul ordained and made for this End &s;hould not feel its pre&s;ent Separation from God by &s;in, and the Bitterne&s;s of the Evil of it, it would never &s;eek to return again to him as to his greate&s;t Good, nor de&s;ire ever to come into his Bo|&s;om again; for look as &s;in wounds the Soul, &s;o the Soul &s;eeks for healing of it; if only the Torment of &s;in wound, ea&s;e of Con&s;cience from that Angui&s;h will heal it: &s;o if &s;eparation from God wounds the Heart, only Union and Communion with God will heal it, and comfort it again. The Lord Chri&s;t therefore having laid his Hand upon the Soul to bring it back to him&s;elf fir&s;t, and &s;o to the Father, being de&s;igned to gather in all the Outca&s;ts of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> tho&s;e he ever makes to feel them&s;elves Out-ca&s;ts, as ca&s;t

away out of God's ble&s;&s;ed Sight and Pre&s;ence, that &s;o they may de&s;ire at la&s;t to come home again: Repro|bates, not made for this End, have not this &s;en&s;e of &s;in, the Means of their return. And hence it is that the Souls of tho&s;e God &s;aves, are never quiet untill they come to God, and have Communion with him; but they mourn for their Di&s;tance from him, and the Hiding of his Face, until the Lord &s;hine forth again; Whereas every one el&s;e tho' much troubled, yet &s;its down contented with any little odd Thing that &s;erves to quiet them for the Time, before the Lord return to them, or they enter into their Re&s;t, in that ineffable Communion with him.</P>
<P>Let me now make Application of this, before I proceed to open the next Particular of Humiliation.</P>
<P>USE 1. This may &s;hew us the great Mi&s;take of two &s;orts;</P>
<P N="1">1. Such as think there is no Nece&s;&s;ity of any &s;en&s;e of Mi&s;ery before the Application of the Remedy or their Clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t; becau&s;e, &s;ay they, where there is Sen&s;e there is Life: (all Sen&s;e and Feeling a|ri&s;ing from Life) and where there is Life, there is Chri&s;t already. And hence it is that they would not have the Law fir&s;t Preached in tho&s;e Days, but the Go&s;pel; the other is to go round about the Bu&s;h.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that for my own Part this Doctrine (of &s;eeing and feeling our Mi&s;ery before the Remedy) is &s;o univer&s;ally received by all &s;olid Divines both at Home and Abroad, that I meet with; and the con|trary Opinion &s;o cro&s;s to the Holy Scriptures, and ge|neral Experience of the Saints, and the Preaching of the other &s;o abundantly &s;ealed to be God's own Way by his rich Ble&s;&s;ings on the Labours of others of his Servants faithful to him herein; that were it not for the &s;ake of &s;ome weak and mi&s;led, I would not dare
<PB N="71" REF="005059_0076_10169613F9FEAE00">
to que&s;tion it; the Lord him&s;elf &s;o expre&s;ly &s;peaking, that <HI>he came not to call the Righteous, but</HI> on the con|trary only <HI>to heal the &s;ick,</HI> who know and feel their &s;ickne&s;s chiefly <HI>by the Law,</HI> Rom. 3.20. Do&s;t thou think therefore, that there is &s;piritual Life where ever there is any &s;en&s;e? Then I &s;ay, the Devils &amp; Damned in Hell have much &s;piritual Life, for they feel their Mi&s;ery with a Witne&s;s.</P>
<P>As for the Preaching of the Go&s;pel before the Law to &s;hew our Mi&s;ery; it is true, that the Go&s;pel is to be look'd at, as the main End; yet you mu&s;t u&s;e the Means, before you can come to the End, by the Preaching of the Law, or Mi&s;ery in de&s;pi&s;ing the Go&s;|pel, End and Means have been ever good Friends, and you may join them well together, you cannot &s;ever them without Danger. I do ob&s;erve that the Apo&s;tles ever u&s;ed this Method: <HI>Paul</HI> fir&s;t proves <HI>Jews and Gentiles to be under Sin,</HI> in almo&s;t the three fir&s;t Chapters of the <HI>Romans,</HI> before he opens the Doc|trine of Ju&s;tification by <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t.</HI> I do not ob&s;erve that ever there was &s;o clear and manife&s;t o|pening of Man's Mi&s;ery, as by Chri&s;t and his Apo|&s;tles, who bro't in the cleare&s;t Revelations of the Re|medy. I do not read in <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or in all the Prophets, &s;uch full and plain Expre&s;&s;ions of our Mi&s;ery as in the new Te&s;tament: <HI>The Worm that never dies; the Fire that never goes out; the Wrath to come, &amp;c.</HI> and there|fore a&s;&s;uredly they tho't this no Back-Door, but Faith the Door to Chri&s;t, and this the Way to Faith. To &s;ay that a Man mu&s;t fir&s;t have Chri&s;t and Life, before he feel any &s;piritual Mi&s;ery, is to &s;ay, that a Chri&s;tian mu&s;t fir&s;t be healed, that he may be &s;ick; cured, that he may be wounded; receive the Spirit of Adoption, before he receive the Spirit of Bondage; and that he may receive the Spirit of Bondage to fear again.</P>

You mu&s;t preach the Remedy; that is true: But you mu&s;t al&s;o fir&s;t preach the Wo and Mi&s;ery of Men, or rather &s;o mix them together, as the Hearts of Hearers may be deeply affected with both; but fir&s;t with their Mi&s;ery. It argues a great Con&s;umption of the Spirit of Grace, when Chri&s;tians lives are pre&s;erved only by Alchermys and choice Cordials, Notions about Chri&s;t, nay, choice ones too, or el&s;e the old and ordinary Food of the Country will not down.

This is common to the mo&s;t wicked Man, nay, to the vile&s;t Creature in the World. Hence it follows that our Union is by &s;ome Act of the Spirit peculiar to the Elect (who only &s;hall have Communion with Chri&s;t) working &s;ome real Change in the Soul, (for of real, not relative Union I now &s;peak) this Act cannot be tho&s;e fir&s;t Acts of the Spirit of Bondage, (for they are common unto Reprobates) they are therefore &s;uch Acts as are e&s;&s;ential unto the Nature of Union.

Hence that Act of the Spirit in uni|ting us to Chri&s;t, can be nothing el&s;e but the bring|ing back the Soul unto Chri&s;t, or the Conjunction of the Soul unto Chri&s;t, and into Chri&s;t, by bringing it back to him, that before this lay like a dry Bone in the Valley &s;eparated from him. Thus, 1 Cor. 6.17. <HI>He that is joined,</HI> or (as the Word &s;ignifies) <HI>glewed to the Lord, is one Spirit with him.</HI> The Spirit therefore brings us to the Lord Chri&s;t, and &s;o we are in him.

As our Marriage Union to Chri&s;t mu&s;t have Con&s;ent of Faith on our Part, wro't by the Spirit, or el&s;e the Lord Je&s;us is a vain Suitor to us; &s;o now the Spirit on Chri&s;t's Part mu&s;t apprehend our Faith; and dwell in us, who otherwi&s;e &s;hall &s;ud|denly go a Whoring from him, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.17.</P>

The&s;e Acts of Self-confidence may not be &s;tirring in all Chri&s;tians; but in all Men there is this Frame of Spirit, never to come to Chri&s;t, if they can make any thing el&s;e &s;erve to heal them or &s;ave them; and therefore the Spirit cuts off this &s;inful Frame in part in all the Elect; he hews the Roughne&s;s and Pride of Spirit off, that it may lie &s;till upon the Foundation it is now prepared for. Now tho' the Spirit works this, yet 'tis not without the Word; the Word it works chiefly by, is the <HI>Law,</HI> Gal 3.19. <HI>I thro' the Law am dead to it,</HI> (i. e. from &s;eeking any Life or Help from it) <HI>that I might live unto God.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Law doth this by a four-fold Act,</P>
<P N="1">1.

It is true, I confe&s;s you may grow (to your Feeling) wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and it is fit you &s;hould feel it, that the Lord hereby might pull down your proud Heart, and make you lie low; it is the Lord's glorious Wi&s;dom to wither all your Flowers, which refre&s;hed you with|out Chri&s;t, that you might feel a Need of him; and therefore I &s;ay the Lord pulls away all tho&s;e broken Planks the Soul once floated and re&s;ted upon, that the Soul may &s;ink in a holy De&s;pair of any Help from any Good it hath; the Lord &s;hakes down all Building on a &s;andy Foundation: And then the Soul cries out, It is ill re&s;ting here.</P>

&s;upernatural Truths; hence God reveals them in his Word; hence Faith &s;ees them and a&s;&s;ents to them, becau&s;e God hath &s;poken them: To &s;ee and know Things by Vi&s;ion, is to &s;ee Things in them&s;elves intu|itively and immediately; but to &s;ee Things by Faith is to &s;ee them by and in a Te&s;timony given of them, John 20.20. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is he that hath not &s;een, (i. e.</HI> Chri&s;t immediately) <HI>but believed, i. e.</HI> his Te&s;timony, and on him in it; this A&s;&s;ent therefore is in Faith (for we mu&s;t believe Chri&s;t before we can believe in him) but this comprehends not the whole Nature of Faith; I mean of that Faith we are now &s;peaking of; <HI>viz.</HI> as it unites us to Chri&s;t, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth us with Chri&s;t.

<P N="1">1. This De&s;cription placeth Faith only in the Un|der&s;tanding, whereas 'tis al&s;o in the Will, as the Words, <HI>tru&s;ting, rolling, &amp;c.</HI> intimate.</P>

<P N="4">4. It is the Papi&s;t's Aim to vilify Faith hereby, by de&s;cribing it by that which is one Ingredient in it, but excluding that which is principal; tho&s;e Phra&s;es there|fore of <HI>believing Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h,</HI> 1 John 4.3. and that <HI>he is the Son of God,</HI> Mat. 16.16. as if this were the only Object to Faith, are not to be under|&s;tood exclu&s;ively, excluding other Acts of Faith, which the Scripture in other Places, &s;ets down clearly; but inclu&s;ively, as &s;uppo&s;ing them to be contained herein: For as we in our Times de&s;cribing Faith by relying upon Chri&s;t for Salvation, do not exclude hereby our believing that he is the Me&s;&s;iah; but we include it,

or &s;uppo&s;e it, becau&s;e that is not now que&s;tioned, the Truth of the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pel being &s;o abundantly cleared; &s;o in tho&s;e Times, they de&s;cribed Faith by one prin|cipal Act, to believe that he was the Son of God, and come into the Fle&s;h, becau&s;e this was the main and principal Thing in Que&s;tion then: And if the Lord had not &s;et our Faith by other Acts in Scripture, we &s;hall not vary from our Compa&s;s in &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions in the Word in the&s;e Days: For their Faith then is exemplary to us now; becau&s;e the Word doth more fully &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t it out in more &s;pecial Acts, hence we &s;et it al|&s;o by them; for 'tis evident, as the Jews did believe in a Me&s;&s;iah to come, &s;o they did al&s;o believe and look for all Good from him, John 4.25. <HI>He will teach us all Things when he comes;</HI> and therefore their Faith did not confine it&s;elf to that hi&s;torical Act that a Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould come, or that this was the Me&s;&s;iah, but they did expect and look for all Good from him: And hence the Apo&s;tle expounding this Saying, <HI>viz.</HI> believing that Chri&s;t is dead and ri&s;en again, we &s;hall hereby be &s;aved: Rom. 10.9, 10. <HI>If thou believe&s;t</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>with thine Heart</HI> this Truth, <HI>thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> Now <HI>to believe with the Heart,</HI> as it doth not exclude A&s;&s;ent, &s;o it nece&s;&s;arily includes the Acts of the Will and Affections in relying upon him, and coming to him. And hence, when <HI>Peter</HI> had made that Confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.16. Chri&s;t tells him, <HI>Thou art Peter; i. e.</HI> a Stone re&s;ting upon the Rock, (as &s;ome good Interpreters expound it) and therefore <HI>Peter</HI>'s Faith did not exclude the&s;e principal Acts of re&s;ting on Chri&s;t, cleaving to Chri&s;t, but did include and &s;uppo&s;e them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some run into another Extream, and make Faith nothing el&s;e, but a Per&s;wa&s;ion or A&s;&s;urance that Chri&s;t died for me in particular, or that he is

mine. That which moves &s;ome thus to think, is the univer&s;al Redemption by the Death of Chri&s;t; they know no Ground or Bottom for Faith but this Propo|&s;ition, Chri&s;t died for thee, and hence makes Re|demption univer&s;al: And hence the <HI>Arminians</HI> boa&s;t &s;o much of their <HI>Quod unu&s;qui&s;que tenatur credere,</HI> &amp;c. But,</P>
<P N="1">1. This is a fal&s;e Bottom, for Chri&s;t hath not died for all, becau&s;e he hath not prayed for all, <HI>John</HI> 17.2.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is a &s;andy Bottom and Foundation, which when a Chri&s;tian re&s;ts upon, it &s;hakes under him, when the Soul &s;hall think, tho' Chri&s;t hath died for me, yet no more for me, than for <HI>Judas,</HI> or Thou|&s;ands of Reprobates now in Hell. Indeed after Faith, a Chri&s;tian is bound to believe it, as <HI>Paul</HI> did, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.20. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.1, 2.</P>
<P>I conceive therefore tho&s;e holy Men of ours who have de&s;cribed Faith by A&s;&s;urance, have not &s;o much aimed at a De&s;cription of what Faith is in it &s;elf, as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth us with Chri&s;t; but of what Degree and Extent it may be, and &s;hould be in us; they de&s;cribe it therefore by the mo&s;t eminent Act of it, in full A&s;&s;urance: And therefore con&s;ult with the Authors of this De&s;cription, and enquire of them, Is there no Doubting mixt with Faith? Yes, &s;ay they, Man's Doubtings &s;ometimes are even unto a Kind of De|&s;pair, but then (&s;ay they) it &s;hould not be thus. The Papi&s;ts commend Doubtings, and deny A&s;&s;urance, place Faith in a general A&s;&s;ent; our Champions that were to wre&s;tle with them, maintained it to be a particular Application, (and not only a general A&s;&s;ent) and that with a full A&s;&s;urance of Per&s;wa&s;ion, which being the mo&s;t eminent Act of Faith, excludes not other inferior Acts of it, which as they are before it, &s;o may po&s;&s;e&s;s the Soul with Chri&s;t without it. Al|tho'

withal, it is certain, that there is no true Faith, but it hath &s;ome A&s;&s;urance, of which afterward.</P>

<HEAD>I. The efficient Cau&s;e of Faith.</HEAD>
<P>Faith is a gracious Work of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, the Spirit therefore is the efficient Cau&s;e or principal Workman of Faith; the Spirit doth not believe, but cau&s;eth us to believe; 'tis not <HI>Principium qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d,</HI> the Principle which doth believe, but <HI>Principium quo,</HI> the Principle by which we do; the Souls of all the Elect (e&s;pecially when humbled) are, of all other Things, mu&s;t unable to believe: Nay look as before Com|punction and Humiliation, Satan held the Soul cap|tive chiefly by its Lu&s;ts and Sins; &s;o now when the Lord hath burnt tho&s;e Cords, and broken tho&s;e Chains, all the Powers of Darkne&s;s &s;trengthen them&s;elves, and keep the Soul under mightily, by Unbelief. What do you tell me of Mercy? &s;aith the Soul) 'tis Mercy which I have continually re&s;i&s;ted, de&s;perately de&s;pi&s;ed; why do you per&s;wade me to believe? Alas I cannot; 'tis true, all that which you &s;ay is true, if I could believe, but I cannot &s;ee Chri&s;t, I cannot come at Chri&s;t, I &s;eek him in the Means, but he for|&s;akes me there, and I am left of God de&s;olate; and
<PB N="223" REF="005059_0128_101696956D778AA8">
here, Beloved, the Soul had not formerly &s;o many Excu&s;es for its Sin, as now it hath Clouds of Objec|tions again&s;t believing; the Spirit therefore takes fa&s;t hold of the Souls of all the Elect, draws them unto Chri&s;t; and therefore it is called <HI>the Spirit of Faith,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.13. and that by an omnipotent and irre&s;i|&s;table Power, I&s;ai. 53.1. <HI>Who hath believed? and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</HI> That the Soul mu&s;t and &s;hall believe now. <HI>Compell them to come in,</HI> &s;aith the Lord of the Supper, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.23. This the <HI>Arminians</HI> will not believe, for (&s;ay they) the Que&s;tion is not, Whether we are enabled to be|lieve by Grace? but, Whether it be after this Man|ner, and by this Means, <HI>viz. modo irre&s;i&s;tibilli?</HI> Con|&s;ider therefore the&s;e Rea&s;ons, to clear this Point,</P>
<P N="1">1. Whence doth our Call and Coming to Chri&s;t ari&s;e, but from God's immoveable and unchangeable Purpo&s;e? <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.28. The Lord therefore mu&s;t either alter his Purpo&s;e, or prevail with the Soul to believe, and over-power the Heart thereunto.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is not Chri&s;t Je&s;us bound by Office and Pro|mi&s;e to the Father to bring in all his lo&s;t &s;cattered Sheep, that &s;o the Father and he may be glorified in them? John 10.16. <HI>Other Sheep I have, tho&s;e I mu&s;t bring home, and they &s;hall hear my Voice.</HI> You that complain you cannot believe, nay, that you have no Heart to believe, the Lord mu&s;t fetch you in; and you &s;hall hear the Bridegroom's Voice with Joy.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is not the Act of believing wrought by a crea|ting Power? <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.9. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.10. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 57.18, 19. <HI>I create the Fruit of the Lips Peace, Peace to him that is near, and afar off:</HI> And is not a creating Voice irre&s;i&s;table, though there be nothing for it to work upon? So tho' you have no Ability, Heart, Head,
<PB N="124" REF="005059_0129_10169652709030A0">
or Strength to believe, yet the Lord will create the Fruit of the Lips of God's Me&s;&s;engers, Peace, Peace.</P>
<P N="4">4. Doth not the Lord let in that infinite and &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing Sweetne&s;s of Grace, when he works the Soul to believe, &s;tanding in extream Need of that Grace, that it cannot but come and cleave to it? P&s;al. 63.2.3. <HI>I long to &s;ee thee,</HI> &s;aith <HI>David, for thy Loving-kindne&s;s is better than Life;</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Man to cleave to his Life? Much more to that which is better than Life: The Light is &s;o clear, it cannot but &s;ee and wonder at Grace; the Good is &s;o &s;weet, it cannot but ta&s;te and accept what God &s;o freely of|fers; <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 36.7. And therefore the poor <HI>Canaani|ti&s;h</HI> Woman, <HI>Matth.</HI> 15. could not be driven away, tho' Chri&s;t bid her in a Manner be gone; but &s;he made all the Objections again&s;t her Arguments for her (as u&s;ually Faith doth, when under this Stroke of the Spirit) <HI>the Violent take the Kingdom of Heaven by Force;</HI> the Spirit puts a Nece&s;&s;ity upom them, and irre&s;i&s;tably over-powers them, and this is the Cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>And is not this matter of great Con&s;olation to all tho&s;e who feel them&s;elves utterly unable to Believe? You think the Lord would give Peace and Pardon, Life and Mercy, if I could Believe; Oh con&s;ider the Lord hath undertaken in the Covenant of Grace to work in all his the Condition of the Covenant, as well as to convey the good of it, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.31, 32, 33, 34. He hath done this for others by an irre&s;i&s;table Power, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.1, 2. Look up to Je&s;us the author and fini&s;her of your Faith, He came out of his Father's Bo&s;om, not only to give Life by his Death, but to enable his to Eat and Clo&s;e with him by Faith, that they might <HI>never Die, John</HI> 6.50. So that the Lord may work it in thee; it is true al&s;o, he may not, yet
<PB N="125" REF="005059_0130_10169696F6121250">
it is un&s;peakable Comfort to con&s;ider, that if the Lord had put it over unto thee to Believe, it is certain thou &s;hould&s;t never have Believed, but now the Work is put into the Hand of Chri&s;t; that which is impo&s;&s;ible to thee, is po&s;&s;ible, nay ea&s;y, with him; he can com|prehend thee, when thou can&s;t not apprehend him: This is exceeding &s;weet when the Body is Sick, and Soul is De&s;erted, incredible things to be Believed, are Propounded, an impo&s;&s;ible Work to thy Weakne&s;s Urged, upon Pain of God's &s;ore&s;t and mo&s;t un&s;peak|able Wrath; to con&s;ider it is not in me, but in the Lord's own Hand, and it is his Office, his Glory to work Faith, and as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, <HI>to &s;hew Mercy unto them that are &s;hut up,</HI> not only <HI>under Sin,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Unbelief;</HI> Rom. 11.32. But why hath the Lord made thee feel thy inability to Believe? Truly the end of our Wants is not to make us Sin and &s;hift for our &s;elves, but to ask and &s;eek for Supply, and the end of the continuance of tho&s;e Wants is, that we &s;hould continue to a&s;k and &s;eek. And do&s;t thou think thou &s;halt &s;eek to the Lord by his own Hand to create Faith, and fetch thee in, and will not the Lord take his time to work it? <HI>He that Believes,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, Rom. 10.11. <HI>&s;hall not be a&s;hamed;</HI> why &s;o? <HI>Becau&s;e the Lord,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>who is over all, is rich unto all that call upon him,</HI> ver. 12. If thou ha&s;t not a Heart &s;hut up from a&s;king of it; the Lord who hath Power, hath not a Heart &s;hut up towards thee from work|ing it.</P>
<P>But withal be thankful exceedingly, all you who&s;e Hearts the Lord hath drawn and overcome; he came to his own People the <HI>Jews,</HI> and would oft have gathered them, but they would not, and there|fore he for&s;ook them, and left their Habitations de|&s;olate; Oh how oft would the Lord have gathered

<HEAD>II. The Subject or Matter of Faith.</HEAD>
<P>This is the &s;econd Thing in the De&s;cription of Faith, the Soul of an humbled Sinner is the Subject or Matter of Faith. I do not mean the Matter out of which Faith is wrought, (for there is nothing in Man out of which the Spirit begets it) but that wherein Faith is &s;eated. I mean al&s;o the Habit of Faith, not the Principle of it; for that is out of Man in the Lord Je&s;us, who is therefore called <HI>our Hope,</HI> as well as <HI>our Strength;</HI> the Soul therefore is the Sub|ject of Faith, called <HI>the Heart,</HI> Rom. 10.9. com|pared with <HI>Matth.</HI> 6.21. For we cannot go or come to Chri&s;t in this Life with our Bodies, we are <HI>here ab&s;ent from the Lord,</HI> 2 Cor. 5. but the Soul can go to him, the Heart can be with him, as the Eye can &s;ee a thou&s;and Miles off, and receive the Species or Image of the Things it &s;ees into it, &s;o the Soul en|lightned by Faith, can &s;ee Chri&s;t afar off, it can long for, choo&s;e, and re&s;t upon the Lord of Life, and re|ceive the lively Image of Chri&s;t's Glory in it; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. <HI>ult.</HI></P>
<P>If Chri&s;t were pre&s;ent upon Earth, the Soul (not the Body) only could truly receive him; Chri&s;t comes to the Elect only by his Spirit, and hence on Spirits only are fit to receive him and clo&s;e with him. Thou&s;ands hear Chri&s;t outwardly, that inwardly a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

deaf to all God's Calls, their Spirits &s;ee not, ta&s;te not, feel not; it is therefore the <HI>Soul</HI> that is the Subject of Faith: And, I &s;ay, it is an <HI>humble empty</HI> Soul which is the Subject; for a full, proud, broken Spi|rit cannot, nay, will not, receive Chri&s;t, as we have proved; and therefore <HI>Luke</HI> 14. the Servant is com|manded to bid the <HI>poor, halt, and blind, and Lame to come in;</HI> they would not make Excu&s;es as others did: They that were &s;tung to Death with <HI>fiery Ser|pents,</HI> were the only Men that the <HI>bra&s;en Serpent</HI> was lifted up for them <HI>to look upon,</HI> and to be <HI>healed,</HI> John 3.14. And therefore the Promi&s;e doth run, <HI>If any Man lack Wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k it,</HI> but <HI>if any Man want Wi&s;dom,</HI> Jam. 1.5. &s;o if any Man want Light, want Life, want Peace, Pardon, want Chri&s;t and his Spirit, let them a&s;k, and the Lord will give, away with your Money if you come to the&s;e Waters to buy, and take <HI>freely: If any Man would be wi&s;e, let him be a Fool,</HI> (&s;aith the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle) an empty Nothing: A Soul in a peri&s;hing, helple&s;s, hopele&s;s Condition, is the Subject of Faith; &s;uch only feel their Need of Chri&s;t, are glad at the Offer of Chri&s;t, and therefore &s;uch only can and will receive Chri&s;t, and come unto Chri&s;t by Faith: And truly if we had but Hearts, the Con&s;ideration of this might be Ground of great Comfort and Confidence unto all God's People, who&s;e Souls come unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for that which was in <HI>Thomas,</HI> John 21. is in all Men naturally, if we could &s;ee Chri&s;t with our Eyes, and feel him with our Hands, and embrace him (as <HI>Mary</HI> did) with our Arms, if we could hear him&s;elf &s;peak, we could <HI>then believe</HI> as they &s;aid, <HI>if he will come from the Cro&s;s,</HI> &s;o we &s;ay, if he will come down from Heaven thus unto us, we will <HI>then</HI> believe; if we want this, we fear we may be at la&s;t deceived, be|cau&s;e

we want Sen&s;e, and cannot come to clo&s;e with our Eyes and Hands the Objects of our Faith; but Oh con&s;ider this Point, we are made Partakers of Chri&s;t's Life and Salvation by him, <HI>Acts</HI> 10.43. only yet certainly by Faith. Now this Faith is not by &s;eeing him with our Eyes, coming near to him with our Bodies, but coming to him with our Souls; the Soul is the Seat of Faith. Now this you may do, tho' you never thus &s;aw him, <HI>whom though you &s;ee not, yet believing you rejoice,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.8. This Coming of the Soul to Chri&s;t, doth make a firmer Union be|tween thee and Chri&s;t, than if thou wert bodily pre&s;ent with him in Heaven. For many touched and crowded him, that never were truly united to him, or received Virtue from him. If our Souls were in the third Heaven with Chri&s;t, who of us would then doubt of our Portion in him? I tell you, if your Souls go out of Sin and Self, unto Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, and there re&s;t, this makes you nearer to him, than if your Souls were under his Wing in the high|e&s;t Heavens. The poor Sea-Man when he is near dangerous Shores, when he cannot go down to the Depth of the Sea to fa&s;ten his Ship, yet if he can ca&s;t his Anchor twenty or forty Fathom deep, and if that holds, this quiets him in the fore&s;t Storms; when we are to&s;&s;ed and cannot come to Chri&s;t with our bodily Pre&s;ence, yet if our Souls can come, if our Faith, our Anchor, can reach him, and knit us to him, this &s;hould exceedingly comfort our Hearts.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Chri&s;t comes to you in his Word and Co|venant of Grace, there is his Spirit, his Truth, Good|ne&s;s, Love, Faithfulne&s;s: receive this, you receive him; embrace this, you embrace him; as among

<P>By the Word let thine Eye pitch upon the Per|&s;on: do not only account the Promi&s;e true, but with <HI>Sarah, Heb.</HI> 11.11. account <HI>him</HI> Faithful who hath promi&s;ed; and then let thy Heart roll it &s;elf upon that Grace and Faithfulne&s;s revealed in this Word, lean upon the Brea&s;t of this Beloved: And thus the Soul by the Chariot Wheels and Wings of the Word, is Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Chri&s;t in it, and carried up to Chri&s;t's Cro&s;s, as dying, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.1. and from thence to his Glory in his Kingdom by it, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.19, 20. As a Man that gives a great E&s;tate by &s;ome Writing to us, we believe it as if he were pre&s;ent; and by this we do not only believe the Writing to be true, but the Man to be faithful and loving to us; and hereupon our Hearts are carried after the Man him&s;elf, tho' afar off from us. Thus we a&s;cend to Chri&s;t in the Cloud of Faith; as <HI>Jacob,</HI> tho' he could hardly be|lieve, yet as &s;oon as he was per&s;waded <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was yet alive, his Spirit pre&s;ently revived, and it was immedi|ately with him, before his Body came to him: So 'tis with Faith; the Soul goes unto Chri&s;t, before our Bodies and Souls both together &s;hall have immediate Communion with him.</P>

<HEAD>III. The Form of Faith.</HEAD>
<P>This is the third Thing in the De&s;cription of Faith; the coming of the whole Soul out of it&s;elf unto Chri&s;t is the Form of Faith, and that wherein the Life and E&s;&s;ence of it con&s;i&s;ts, and which doth difference it from all other Graces of the Spirit. The fir&s;t Act of Faith, as it unites us to Chri&s;t, is not A&s;&s;urance that
<PB N="134" REF="005059_0139_10166674457AFC10">
he is mine, but a coming to him with A&s;&s;urance that hereby he is become mine. <HI>Come unto the Waters,</HI> and <HI>&s;o buy Wine and Milk,</HI> I&s;ai. 55.1, 2. <HI>i. e.</HI> now make them your own. The <HI>weary and heavy laden</HI> &s;hall not <HI>have re&s;t,</HI> unle&s;s they come to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for it, <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.28. Faith doth nothing for Life, (for that is the Law of Works) it only receives him who hath done all for it, it comes out of all it hath or doth, (like <HI>Abraham</HI> that left his Servants behind him, when he went up to God in the Mount) unto Chri&s;t for Life. Conceive it thus; <HI>Adam</HI> had a Principle and Stock of Life in him&s;elf, in his own Hand, and there|fore was to live by this, to live of him&s;elf, and from him&s;elf, and therefore had no Need nor U&s;e of Faith; he lived by the Law of Works; which the Apo&s;tle &s;ets in a direct Oppo&s;ition to the Law of Faith; but <HI>Adam</HI> being now fallen, hath lo&s;t his Life, and became not like the Man that fell among Thieves betwixt <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and <HI>Jericho,</HI> &s;tript, wounded, and half dead, but <HI>wholly dead,</HI> Eph. 2.1. &s;o that let any Man &s;eek Life from him&s;elf, it's impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould live: For if there had been a Law that could have given Life, our Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould have been there|by, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.21. Hence it follows, if any Man will have Life, he mu&s;t go out of him&s;elf to another, <HI>viz.</HI> the Lord of Life for it, <HI>John</HI> 5.40. and 6.27, 28, 29.</P>
<P>Now ob&s;erve it, this very Coming, this very Mo|tion of the Soul to Chri&s;t, (a Grace which <HI>Adam</HI> neither had, nor had Power to u&s;e) is Faith; the Spirit of Chri&s;t moving or drawing the Soul, the Soul is thence moved, and &s;o comes to Chri&s;t, <HI>John</HI> 6.64, 65. The Soul by Sin is averted from God, and turns his Back upon God; the Turning or Coming of the Soul (not unto Duties of Holine&s;s, for that is
<PB N="135" REF="005059_0140_101696A4B465F890">
Obedience properly, but) unto God, in Chri&s;t again, is properly and formally Faith. All Evil is in Man's &s;elf, and from him&s;elf; all Man's Good is in Chri&s;t, and from Chri&s;t. The Souls of all God's Elect, &s;ee|ing the&s;e Things, for&s;ake and renounce them&s;elves, in whom and from whom is all their Evil, and come unto Chri&s;t, in whom and from whom is all their Good. This Motion of the Soul between the&s;e Extreams, thro' that va&s;t and infinite Di&s;tance that is between a &s;inful wretched Man and a ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, is Faith; for by Faith principally we <HI>pa&s;s from Death to Life,</HI> John 5.24. The Soul of a poor Sinner wounded and humbled; &s;ometimes knows not Chri&s;t, and then crys out, as tho&s;e Acts 2.37. <HI>What &s;hall I do?</HI> Whither &s;hall I go? Sometimes dares not, &s;ome|times cannot, it hath no Heart to &s;tir or come, it therefore looks up, and longs, and goes unto the Lord to draw it, like poor <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Jer. 31.18. <HI>Oh turn me Lord, and then I &s;hall be turned,</HI> Lam. 5.21. and this is the lowe&s;t and lea&s;t Degree of Faith. But at &s;ome other Time, the Soul mourning for Want of the Lord, the Lord comes unto it with great Clearne&s;s, Glory and Sweetne&s;s of Grace and Peace; and hence the Soul cannot but come and clo&s;e with him, and cry, <HI>Rabboni,</HI> and &s;ay, Oh Lord, is it thy good Plea&s;ure to have Re&s;pect to &s;uch a Clod of Earth, to render &s;uch Riches of Grace to one &s;o un|worthy, and to bid, nay, to be&s;eech me to come and take? Lord, behold I come: This is Faith. Would you have a Proof of it? Con&s;ider therefore the&s;e Particulars, 1. Con&s;ider the&s;e Scriptures: John 6.35. <HI>I am the Bread of Life, he that cometh to me &s;hall never Hunger, and he that believeth in me &s;hall never Thir&s;t.</HI> Where you &s;ee <HI>Coming to Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>be|lieving in Chri&s;t</HI> are all one. So John 7.37. <HI>In the
<PB N="136" REF="005059_0141_10169661D9A49340">
la&s;t Day of the Fea&s;t the Lord Chri&s;t crys out with much Vehemency, If any Man thir&s;t, let him come unto me and drink.</HI> Now in the next Ver&s;e our Saviour expounds this <HI>Coming;</HI> for &s;aith he, <HI>He that believeth on me, out of his Belly,</HI> &amp;c. So to come to Chri&s;t, as upon this to drink in of Chri&s;t's Fulne&s;s, is believing in Chri&s;t. So <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.6. the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Without Faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God;</HI> and then in rendering the Rea&s;on of this, explains what he meant by <HI>Faith, viz.</HI> to be our Coming unto God, upon a double Te&s;ti|mony, <HI>believing</HI> fir&s;t <HI>that he is,</HI> &s;econdly, <HI>that he is a Rewarder of them that &s;eek him diligently,</HI> or (which is all one) who do come unto him. So John 1.12. <HI>So many as received him,</HI> (which is all one with Coming) <HI>he adopted them as Sons, even to them that believe in his Name.</HI> And hence we &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the Scrip|ture doth not attribute our Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Life to our believing <HI>of</HI> Chri&s;t, but to our believing <HI>on</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t, (a Phra&s;e peculiar to heavenly Lan|guage, and therefore not found in any human Writer) becau&s;e it is not the bare believing of a Te&s;timony that &s;aveth us, unle&s;s we &s;o believe it, as to believe in Chri&s;t, which cannot be but by Coming to him, and as it were in him, or into him, our Union with Chri&s;t being made compleat hereby.</P>
<P N="2">2. That upon which the Lord promi&s;ed Life, and Salvation, and Mercy, cannot be Works, but Faith, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.21. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.6. but thro' out all the old and new Te&s;tament, the Lord promi&s;eth Life and Salva|tion to Commers, or to them that return, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.12. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.10. <HI>Joel</HI> 2.12, 13. <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25. <HI>John</HI> 5.40.</P>

The coming under them therefore can be nothing el&s;e but Faith, the proper Obedience to the Go&s;pel, as Works are under the Voice of the Law. Thus Faith is the Coming of the Soul to Chri&s;t. But you will &s;ay, Did not many come to Chri&s;t that were never &s;aved by him?</P>
<P>Yes, many came to him with their bodily Pre&s;ence, that were excluded from him, <HI>John</HI> 6.36.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, Do not many Men's Souls come, are not many Men's Hearts moving towards Chri&s;t, and yet excluded from Chri&s;t? Do not many cry, Lord, Lord? Are not many enlightned and ta&s;te of this heavenly Gift, and yet fall away? I confe&s;s 'tis very true; and therefore it is &s;et down in this De&s;cription of Faith, that it is the coming of the whole Soul unto Chri&s;t. Never did any yet come to Chri&s;t, and receive him with their whole Souls, with all their Hearts, but they had Fruition of him, and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s by him; Faith therefore is not the coming of the Soul, but the coming of the whole Soul unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and this you may be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in upon the&s;e Grounds.</P>
<P N="1">1.

No, no, the Wound is in their Faith, that Pipe is laid but half Way to him, they fall one Foot &s;hort of him, their Souls come, but their whole Souls do not come to him, and hence they never reach Chri&s;t; they lie not in Chri&s;t, and therefore receive not from Chri&s;t, Chri&s;t is precious, (here their Souls come) but not exceed|ing precious, <HI>Preciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> it &s;elf, as the Word is, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.7.

Our Tran&s;lation from Darkne&s;s into God's marvellous Light, is by being <HI>called.</HI> The Soul is lo&s;t in Humiliation, the Lord Je&s;us who is come to &s;ave that which is lo&s;t, &s;eeketh it out in Vo|cation, or Calling, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.9. Sanctification is the re&s;toring of us to the Image of God we once had in <HI>Adam,</HI> as Corruption is the defacing of that Image, Vocation is the Calling of the Soul unto Chri&s;t, this Voice <HI>Adam</HI> never heard of; he did not need any Call to come to Chri&s;t, and therefore was immediately &s;anctified, as &s;oon as he was made: But we need Vo|cation unto Chri&s;t before we can be &s;anctified by Chri&s;t; we need this Call to make us come to Chri&s;t, to put us into Chri&s;t, and therefore much more before we can receive any Holine&s;s from Chri&s;t; the Ground of our coming by Faith, is God's Call, 2 The&s;. 2.13.14. <HI>Cho&s;en to Salvation thro' Sanctification,</HI> (the re|mote End of Vocation) <HI>and Belief of the Truth</HI> (the next End of it) <HI>whereunto he hath called you,</HI> there is the Ground of it.</P>
<P>The Explication of this Call is a Point full of many &s;piritual Difficulties; but of &s;ingular U&s;e and Com|fort to them that are faithful and called; I &s;hall omit many Things, and explicate only tho&s;e Things which &s;erve our Purpo&s;e here, in the&s;e three Particulars.</P>

<ITEM>1. I &s;hall &s;hew you what this Call is, or the Na|ture of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Nece&s;&s;ity of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. How it is a Ground of Coming, and what Kind of Ground for Faith.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1"><PB N="163" REF="005059_0168_10169715611CE9D8">1. The Nature of this Call, I &s;hall open for your more di&s;tinct Under&s;tanding, in &s;everal Propo&s;itions, or The&s;es.</P>
<P>Our Vocation or Calling is ever by &s;ome Word or Voice, either outward, or inward, or both; either ordinary or extraordinary; by the Mini&s;try of Men, or by immediate Vi&s;ions and In&s;pirations of God. I &s;peak not now of extraordinary Call, by Dreams and Vi&s;ions, and immediate In&s;pirations, as in <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> and others, before the Scriptures were penned and publi&s;hed: Nor of extraordinary Call, by the immediate Voice of Chri&s;t; as in <HI>Paul,</HI> and &s;ome other of the Apo&s;tles; for tho&s;e are cea&s;ed now, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.1. unle&s;s it be among People that want ordinary Means, &amp; elect Infants, &amp;c. who&s;e Call mu&s;t be more than by ordinary Means, becau&s;e they want &s;uch Means; we &s;peak now of ordinary Call by the Mini&s;try of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Voice in ordinary calling home of the Elect to Chri&s;t, is not by the Voice of the Law, (for the proper End of that is to reveal Sin and Death, and to ca&s;t down a Sinner) but by the Voice of the Go&s;pel bringing glad Tydings; written by the Apo|&s;tles, and preached to the World. He hath <HI>called you by our Go&s;pel,</HI> 2 The&s;. 2.14. <HI>The&s;e Things are written that you might believe,</HI> John 20.31. <HI>By the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching, the Lord &s;aves them that believe,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.21, with 26. I mean Preaching at the fir&s;t or &s;econd Rebound, by lively Voice, or printed Sermons at the Time of Hearing, or in the Time of deep Meditation, concerning Things heard; the Spirit indeed inwardly accompanies the Voice of the Go&s;pel, but no Man's Call is by the immediate Voice of the Spirit without the Go&s;pel, or the immediate Te&s;timony of the Spirit breathed out of free Grace without the Word, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.12, 13. And there|fore that a Chri&s;tian &s;hould be immediately called
<PB N="164" REF="005059_0169_101696CF6C621750">
without the Scripture, and the Scripture only given to confirm God's immediate Promi&s;e, as a Prince gives his Letter to confirm his Promi&s;e made to a Man before; (as <HI>Valde&s;&s;o</HI> would have it) is both a fal&s;e and dangerous A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P N="3">3. This Voice of the Go&s;pel is the Voice of God in Chri&s;t, or the Voice of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, altho' di&s;|pen&s;ed by Men, who are but weak In&s;truments for this mighty Work &s;ent and &s;et in Chri&s;t's Stead; but the Call, the Voice is Chri&s;t's; it's the Lord's Call, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.6. It is certain &s;ome of the Me&s;&s;en|gers of Chri&s;t called the <HI>Romans</HI> by the Go&s;pel, yet <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, <HI>They were called by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Dead hear his Voice and ari&s;e and live,</HI> John 5.29. 2 The&s;. 2.12, 13. And when the Time of Calling comes, they li&s;ten to it as <HI>his</HI> Call: And hence it is &s;tiled, <HI>Heb.</HI> 3.1. becau&s;e the Lord Chri&s;t from Heaven &s;peaks, takes the written Word in his own Lips, as it were, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.1, 2. and thereby pierceth thro' the Ears to the Heart, thro' all the Noi&s;e of Fears, Sorrows, Objections again&s;t Believing, and makes it to be heard as his Voice; the Bowels of Chri&s;t now yern towards an humbled lo&s;t Sinner, bleeding at his Feet, therefore can contain no longer, but &s;peaks and calls, and makes the Soul under&s;tand his Voice: So that this Call is not a mean Bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e the Lord Je&s;us him&s;elf now &s;peaks, who&s;e Voice is glorious.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Sub&s;tance of this Call, or the Thing the Lord calls unto, is to <HI>come unto him:</HI> For there is a more common Calling (or as &s;ome Term it a par|ticular Calling) of Men, as &s;ome to the <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> or <HI>Servants,</HI> 1 Cor. 7.20, 21, 24. or to <HI>Office in Church or Common-wealth,</HI> as <HI>Aaron, Heb.</HI> 5.4. and the Voice there is to attend unto their Work to which they are called. There is al&s;o a remote End of Vocation, which is to <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> 1 The&s;. 4.7. and
<PB N="165" REF="005059_0170_1016971739369F28">
unto Glory al&s;o, 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2.14. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.14. But we now &s;peak of more &s;pecial Calling, the next End of which is <HI>to come unto Chri&s;t,</HI> the Soul hath lived many Years without him, the Lord Je&s;us will now have the lo&s;t Prodigal to come home, to come to him: The Soul is <HI>weary</HI> and <HI>heavy laden,</HI> and the Lord Je&s;us could Ea&s;e it without its Coming to him: But this is his Will, he mu&s;t <HI>come to him for it:</HI> Matth. 11.27. Jer. 3.7, 22. <HI>I &s;aid after &s;he had done the&s;e Things, Turn unto me, come unto me ye back-&s;liding Children, and I will heal your Back-&s;lidings.</HI> Jer. 4.1. <HI>If thou returne&s;t, return unto me.</HI> This Voice, <HI>Come unto me,</HI> is one of the &s;weete&s;t Words that Chri&s;t can &s;peak, or Man can hear, full of Maje&s;ty, Mer|cy, Grace, and Peace: A poor Sinner thinks; Will the Lord ever put up &s;uch Wrongs as I have offe|red him, heal &s;uch a Nature, take &s;uch a Viper into his Bo&s;om? Do any Thing for me? If there be but one in the World to be for&s;aken, is it not I? The Lord therefore comes and calls, <HI>Come unto me, and I will pardon all thy Sins, I will heal all thy Back-&s;lidings, I will be angry no more,</HI> Jer. 3.12, 13. <HI>Tho' thou ha&s;t committed Whoredom with many Lovers, yet return unto me, &s;aith the Lord,</HI> Jer. 3.1. Tho' thou ha&s;t re&s;i&s;ted my Spirit, refu&s;ed my Grace, wearied me with thine Iniquities, yet come unto me, and this will make me amends; I require nothing of thee el&s;e but <HI>to come,</HI> I&s;ai. 55.1, 2. For God's Call is out of free Grace, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.6. and therefore calls for no more but only to come up and po&s;&s;e&s;s the Lord's Fulne&s;s, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.17. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.9.</P>
<P N="5">5. This Call <HI>to come,</HI> is for Sub&s;tance all one with the Offer of Chri&s;t; which con&s;i&s;ts in three Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Commandment to receive Chri&s;t as pre&s;ent and ready to be given to it; as when we offer any Thing
<PB N="166" REF="005059_0171_101696D27AD38260">
to one another, it is by commanding them to take it, <HI>John</HI> 4.23. And this binds Con&s;cience to believe, as you will An&s;wer for the Contempt of this rich Grace, at the great Day of Account.</P>
<P N="2">2. Per&s;wa&s;ion and Intreaty to come and receive what we offer, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19, 20. For in &s;uch an Offer wherein the Per&s;on is unwilling to receive and we are exceeding de&s;irous to give, we then per&s;wade; &s;o doth Chri&s;t with us.</P>
<P N="3">3. Promi&s;e; to offer a Thing without a Promi&s;e of having it, if we receive it, is but a mock-offer; and hence you &s;hall find in Scripture &s;ome Promi&s;e ever annexed unto God's Offer, which is the Ground of Faith, <HI>Jer.</HI> 22.</P>
<P N="6">6. This Call or Offer hath three &s;pecial Qualifi|cations:</P>
<P N="1">1. It is inward as well as outward, for the Lord calls Thou&s;ands outwardly who yet never come, be|cau&s;e they want an inward Call to come; an inward whi&s;pering &s;till Voice of God's Spirit: And therefore it is &s;aid, <HI>He that hath heard and learned</HI> (not of Man only, but) <HI>of the Father, cometh unto me,</HI> John 6.45. The Lord doth not &s;tand at the outward Door only and call to open, but the Lord Je&s;us comes in, he comes near unto the very Heart of a poor Sinner makes that under&s;tand, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 2.14. and the Lord makes his Grace glorious, and his Mercy &s;weet unto the Hearts of his Elect; look (&s;aith the Lord Je&s;us) how I have left Thou&s;and Thou&s;ands in the World, and have had greater Cau&s;e &s;o to have left thee; but behold I am come unto thee, Oh come thou unto me.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a particular Call; for there is a general Call and Offer of Grace to every one, <HI>Mark</HI> 16.15. Now tho' this be a Means to make it particular, yet
<PB N="167" REF="005059_0172_10169718C6640068">
the Spirit of Chri&s;t which is wont to apply Generals unto Particulars particularly, makes the Call particu|lar, that the Soul &s;ees that the Lord in &s;pecial means me, &s;ingles out me in &s;pecial to believe; otherwi&s;e the Souls of the Elect will not be much moved with the Call of God, &s;o long as they think the Lord offers no more Mercy to me than to any Reprobate; and therefore the Spirit of Chri&s;t makes the Call particu|lar, I&s;ai. 43.1. <HI>I have called thee by Name:</HI> John 10.5. <HI>He calleth all his Sheep by Name;</HI> not that the Lord calls any by their chri&s;ten Name (as we &s;ay) as the Lord did extraordinarily call <HI>Samuel, Samuel,</HI> and <HI>Paul, Paul,</HI> but the Meaning is, look as the Lord from before all Worlds writ down their Names in the Book of Life, and loves them in &s;pecial; &s;o in Vocation (the fir&s;t Opening of Election) the Lord makes his Offer and Call &s;pecial, and &s;o &s;pecial as if it were by Name; for the Soul at this In&s;tant, feels &s;uch a &s;pecial Stirring of the Spirit upon it, which it feels now, and never felt before; as al&s;o its particu|lar Ca&s;e &s;o &s;poken unto, and its particular Objections &s;o an&s;wered, and the Grievou&s;ne&s;s of its Sin in refu|&s;ing Grace &s;o particularly applied, as if God the only Searcher of Hearts only &s;pake unto it, and &s;o dares not but think and believe that the Lord meaneth me.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is effectual as well as inward and particular, Luke 24.33. <HI>Compel them to come in,</HI> John 10.16. Chri&s;t's <HI>other Sheep &s;hall hear Chri&s;t's Voice,</HI> and tho&s;e he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> bring <HI>home;</HI> for every inward Call is not effec|tual. There came a Man in without his wedding Garment, <HI>Matth.</HI> 22.6, 7, 8. whence our Saviour &s;aid, <HI>Many are called, but few cho&s;en;</HI> but this I now &s;peak of, as <HI>a Calling out of Purpo&s;e,</HI> Rom. 8, 28. and therefore never leaves the Soul, until it hath real Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and re&s;ts there; this Call falls
<PB N="168" REF="005059_0173_101696D5444C20D0">
upon a Sinner humbled, not hard hearted; and hence the Call is effectual, <HI>Matth.</HI> 9.12, 13. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 30.10, 11. It is &s;uch a Call as was in Creation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.17. And hence the Soul cannot but come, and when 'tis come it cannot depart, like <HI>Peter, Lord, Whither &s;hould we go?</HI> And therefore tho' it hath never &s;o many Objections in coming to Chri&s;t, never &s;o much Weakne&s;s or Heartle&s;&s;ne&s;s to clo&s;e with Chri&s;t, yet the Lord brings it home, and there keeps it, and now it infinitely ble&s;&s;eth God that ever the Lord gave it an Eye to &s;ee, an Heart to come and &s;eek after Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Thus much of the Nature of this Call, now follows the Nece&s;&s;ity of it, which appears in the&s;e three Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. No Man &s;hould come unle&s;s fir&s;t called; as it is in Calling to an ordinary Office, &s;o 'tis in our Cal|ling much more unto &s;pecial Grace; the Apo&s;tle &s;aith Heb. 5.4. that <HI>no Man takes this Honour, but he that is called of God;</HI> &s;o what hath any Man to do with Chri&s;t, to make him&s;elf a Son of God, and Heir of Glory thereby, but he that is called of God? What have we to do to take other Men's Goods, un|le&s;s called thereto? What have we to do to take the Riches of Grace and Peace, if not called thereto? 'Tis Pre&s;umption to take Chri&s;t whiles uncalled, but not when you are called thereunto.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e no Man would come without the Lord's Call: Matth. 20.6, 7. <HI>Why &s;tand ye here all the Day idle?</HI> The An&s;wer was, <HI>No Man hath hired,</HI> or <HI>called us thereto.</HI> When there is an outward Call only, yet Men will not come in, <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.37. and there|fore there mu&s;t be an effectual Call to bring Men home, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 55.5. and therefore you &s;hall &s;ee many, let there be a legal Command, &s;uppo&s;e to &s;anctify a
<PB N="169" REF="005059_0174_1016971AD0D84180">
Sabbath, or to &s;peak the Truth; they have no Ob|jections again&s;t Obedience unto this: But pre&s;s them to believe, &s;hew them God's Call for it, they have more Fears and Objections ri&s;ing again&s;t this than there be Hairs on their Head, becau&s;e the Soul would not clo&s;e with this.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e no Man could come, unle&s;s called: John 6.44. <HI>No Man can come unto me, unle&s;s the Fa|ther draw him;</HI> and how doth the Father draw any Man but by this Call? If the Lord &s;hould not come and &s;peak him&s;elf, and make his Call the mo&s;t joyful Ty|dings and &s;weete&s;t Me&s;&s;age that ever came to it, it would &s;ay, I have no Heart, I cannot, I am not able, for Rom. 11.32. <HI>We are &s;hut up under Unbelief;</HI> and therefore the Lord Je&s;us, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.5. mu&s;t bring his Sheep home upon his Shoulders, el&s;e it will lie in the Wilderne&s;s of it's own Droopings; whereas when the Lord effectually &s;peaks, the Soul cannot but come.</P>
<P N="3">3. La&s;tly, How this Call is a Ground of Faith, and what Ground of Faith.</P>
<P>For An&s;wer hereunto, I do not make this Call con|&s;idered without the Promi&s;e, the Ground <HI>on which</HI> Faith re&s;ts, (for that is God's free Grace in the Pro|mi&s;e) but the Ground <HI>by which</HI> it re&s;ts, or wherefore it re&s;ts upon the Promi&s;e. The Mind &s;ees (1.) The Freene&s;s of Mercy to a poor Sinner in Mi&s;ery; and this breeds &s;ome Hope the Lord may pity it. (2.) The Fulne&s;s and plenteous Riches of Mercy, and this gives very great Encouragement to the Soul to think: The Lord (if I come to him) &s;urely will not deny me a Drop, <HI>P&s;al,</HI> 130.7, 8. The Prodigal <HI>comes home</HI> becau&s;e of <HI>Bread enough in his Father's Hou&s;e,</HI> tho' he was not certain he &s;hould have any. (3.) The Preciou&s;ne&s;s and Sweetne&s;s of Mercy makes the Soul long vehemently for it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 36.6, 7. and makes
<PB N="170" REF="005059_0175_101696D80556CA70">
it &s;et all other Things at a low Rate to enjoy it, but when unto all this the Lord &s;ends a &s;pecial Command|ment, and a &s;pecial Me&s;&s;age on purpo&s;e, and calls it to come in, and accept of it, and take Mercy as its own, and that for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e it is commanded and called to accept of it; this puts an End to all Doubts, all Fears, all Di&s;couragements, and the Soul an&s;wers as tho&s;e, Jer. 3.22. <HI>Behold we come, thou art the Lord our God.</HI> As a Man in great Want of Bread, one comes and freely offers him Bread to pre&s;erve his Life, the Man takes it; if you a&s;k him, Why do you take it? you are a poor Fel|low unworthy of it, never did one Hour's Work for it: He an&s;wers, 'Tis true, I am unworthy, but yet becau&s;e it is offered to me to pre&s;erve Life, I gladly take it; the Man doth not promi&s;e ab&s;olutely to me, that this Bread is mine, and &s;hall feed me; but he tells me, If I do receive it, it &s;hall certainly be mine to feed me; and this is the main Ground of his re|ceing it. Ju&s;t &s;o it is in Faith; a&s;k an humbled Sin|ner, Why do you believe? Why do you take Chri&s;t as your own? Hath the Lord &s;aid ab&s;olutely that he is yours? No, &s;aith the Soul, but the Lord freely offers him&s;elf to me, who am undone without him, and &s;aith, if I do receive him, he &s;hall be for ever mine, to give Life to me, and therefore I thankfully accept of him; this is the Ground of Faith. The Scripture &s;ets out this in a lively Similitude of a <HI>great Supper,</HI> to which many were <HI>invited;</HI> what was the Ground of their coming to it? Behold, all Things are ready if you come and eat, they are not yours if you do not come; but if you come at my Call and Invitation, then all Things &s;hall be yours, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.17. And hence it is that they that came not, were excluded; they that came were received with Wel|come.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="005059_0176_10169720FB2ED548">I know 'tis a Que&s;tion of &s;ome Difficulty among &s;ome, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether an ab&s;olute Te&s;timony of actual Favour and Ju&s;tification be not the fir&s;t Ground of Faith? They that make Faith to be an ab&s;olute A&s;&s;urance of God's Favour, mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity main|tain this A&s;&s;ertion, and then the&s;e Things will follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. That a Chri&s;tian mu&s;t be ju&s;tified before he believe; for the Cau&s;e of Faith mu&s;t go before Faith. This Propo&s;ition, <HI>Thou art ju&s;tified, reconciled,</HI> is ac|cording to this A&s;&s;ertion the Cau&s;e of Faith: for no Propo&s;ition can therefore be true, becau&s;e we are per&s;waded that it is true, but it mu&s;t fir&s;t be true, before I am per&s;waded of it; the Wall is not white becau&s;e my Eyes &s;ee it &s;o, but it mu&s;t fir&s;t be white, then I &s;ee it &s;o. Now to make actual Ju&s;tification before Faith, is cro&s;s to the whole Current of Scrip|ture. <HI>We believe that we might be ju&s;tified,</HI> Gal. 2.16. we are not ju&s;tified that we might believe. <HI>We pa&s;s from Death to Life by Faith,</HI> John 5.24. We are not in a State of Life before Faith. <HI>When the Lord Je&s;us &s;aw their Faith,</HI> Matth. 9.2. <HI>he</HI> then <HI>&s;aid, Be of good Comfort, thy Sins are forgiven thee.</HI> The Word &s;aith, <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already,</HI> John 3.18. and therefore (unle&s;s the Spirit's Wit|ne&s;s be cro&s;s to the Word) it doth not &s;ay to one that believeth not, that he is ab&s;olved already. <HI>To be ju&s;tified by Faith,</HI> and to be <HI>ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t's Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> is all one in the Scriptures Phra&s;e and Mean|ing, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.16, 17. And therefore we may as well &s;ay that we are ju&s;tified before and without Chri&s;t, as before and without Faith. And indeed this Doc|trine of being ju&s;tified by Faith, and by this Means to have Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> affirms to be the Doctrine of all the Prophets, Acts 10.43. <HI>To him give all the Prophets Witne&s;s, that who&s;oever
<PB N="172" REF="005059_0177_101696DAC3AAE760">
believe in him, &s;hall receive Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins:</HI> Not that they had Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins before they did believe. I know not any one Prote&s;tant Writer that maintains our Ju&s;tification before and without Faith, except learned <HI>Chamier;</HI> who not knowing how to avoid the Blow of <HI>Bellarmine</HI>'s horned Argument, that if Faith be an A&s;&s;urance of our actual Ju&s;tification, then we are fir&s;t ju&s;tified before we believe; he affirms we are ju&s;tified before Faith: And therefore that when the Scripture &s;aith, <HI>we are ju&s;tified by Faith,</HI> the Rea&s;on of that (&s;aith he) is not becau&s;e our Faith do <HI>efficere ju&s;tificationem,</HI> i. e. is a Cau&s;e (meaning in|&s;trumental) of our Ju&s;tification, but becau&s;e <HI>efficitur in ju&s;tificatio,</HI> i. e. is wrought in a ju&s;tified Per&s;on: But if that be the Rea&s;on of the Phra&s;e, we may affirm our Ju&s;tification to be as well by Love, and Sanctifi|cation, and holy Obedience, as by Faith, becau&s;e the&s;e are wro't in a ju&s;tified Per&s;on al&s;o.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then no Man's Mini&s;try, nor the Doctrine de|livered by the faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t from out of the Scriptures, can be any Ground of Faith, for before Faith no Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t can &s;ay to any Man in particular, or any Men in general, that they are already ju&s;tified, and reconciled, and therefore believe it; but to deny that Doctrine which is opened out of the Scriptures by the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, to be the Ground of Faith, is expre&s;ly cro&s;s to the Te&s;ti|mony of Scriptures, and the End of the Mini&s;try, and the Me&s;&s;engers of Chri&s;t, who have the Keys of Office given to them, that <HI>what they bind on Earth, is bound in Heaven; what they loo&s;e on Earth, is loo&s;ed in Heaven; who&s;e Sins they remit, they are forgiven, who&s;e Sins they retain, they are retained,</HI> Matth. 16.16.

The Apo&s;tle an&s;wers, <HI>It is that Word which we preach:</HI> Hereby you &s;hall know whether you &s;hall live or no; but what is that Word <HI>Paul</HI> preached? Is it not an ab&s;olute Te&s;timony that all your Sins are already pardoned by Chri&s;t, and therefore believe it? No, but <HI>if thou believe&s;t with thine Heart that God rai&s;ed up Chri&s;t from the Dead, thou &s;halt be &s;aved,</HI> ver. 9, 11, 12. What can be more full? Yet con&s;ider that one Place more, John 17.20. <HI>I pray for all them that &s;hall believe on me, through their Word.</HI> What is the Ground or Means of believing in Chri&s;t? It is &s;aid here expre&s;ly, <HI>Their Word:</HI> Is it not the Word of Chri&s;t, rather than the Word of the Apo&s;tles and of their Succe&s;&s;ors, in the Doctrine they delivered, is it their Word? Truly that which they delivered, was the Word of Chri&s;t, and that which is opened from their Doctrine in the Scriptures is the Word of Chri&s;t, yet as they open it, and apply it, &s;o 'tis their Word: And this Word is the Ground by which all that Chri&s;t prays for, do believe in Chri&s;t; the bare Word I grant cannot per&s;wade without the Spirit, yet the Spirit will not give Ground to Faith without the Word, but as by it, &s;o upon it, will build the Souls of all the Elect, who are <HI>built upon the Founda|tion of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t being the chief Corner-&s;tone,</HI> Eph. 2.20. <HI>How can they believe without a Preacher,</HI> Rom. 10.14.</P>
<P N="3">3. Then when wicked Men and Reprobates are commanded to believe, (as they are commanded, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.19. <HI>Luke</HI> 14.17. <HI>John</HI> 6.38, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.2.) they are

commanded to believe a Lie, <HI>viz.</HI> That their Sins are pardoned, and they actually ju&s;tified; for if this Te&s;timony be the Ground of Faith, then when they are commanded to believe, they are commanded to be per&s;waded of this Te&s;timony. But the Sins of wick|ed Men, e&s;pecially Reprobates, are not, nor never &s;hall be forgiven; and therefore this cannot be the Ground of Faith.</P>
<P N="4">4. When the Spirit of Adoption, which witne&s;&s;eth that God is our Father, and that we are his Sons re|conciled to him, goes before Faith; but the Apo&s;tle expre&s;ly denies this, <HI>Ye are the Children of God by Faith,</HI> Gal. 3.20. <HI>And becau&s;e ye are Sons, he hath &s;ent unto you the Spirit of Sons, crying Abba Father,</HI> Gal. 4.6.</P>
<P N="5">5. If &s;uch a Te&s;timony &s;hould be the fir&s;t Ground of Faith, then no Man &s;hould believe but he that hath &s;uch a Te&s;timony antecedent to his Faith; but this is cro&s;s to the Scripture; I&s;a. 50.10. <HI>He that &s;its in Darkne&s;s, and &s;ees no Light, let him &s;tay him&s;elf upon God.</HI> When <HI>Jonah</HI> is ca&s;t out of God's Sight to his own Feeling, yet he is bound to look again unto the Temple.</P>
<P N="6">6. This ab&s;olute Te&s;timony is either the Te&s;timo|ny of the Word, or of the Spirit: Not of the Word, as is proved: If of the Spirit, then let it be con&s;idered Whether that can be the Te&s;timony of the Spirit, which is not according to the Word, nay contrary to the Word, for the Word to &s;ay none are ju&s;tified before Faith; for the Spirit to te&s;tify &s;ome are ju&s;ti|fied before Faith. If it be &s;aid, that the Spirit doth not witne&s;s the&s;e to any Man before and without Faith; but yet it is without Re&s;pect unto, or &s;hewing a Man his Faith, for tho&s;e that exclude Sanctification from being any Evi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nce; they me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Faith as well as any other renewed Work of Holine&s;s, and &s;o exclude that

al&s;o, then I &s;ay, the Te&s;timony of the Spirit (which of it &s;elf is exceeding clear) is an ob&s;cure and dark Te&s;timony, becau&s;e it clears up the Praedicate of this Propo&s;ition, <HI>Thou Believer art ju&s;tified,</HI> it witne&s;&s;eth to a Man, <HI>Thou art ju&s;tified;</HI> but clears not up the Subject of it; viz. <HI>Thou Believer:</HI> It makes a Man believe a Te&s;timony without under&s;tanding the full Meaning of it; for the Spirit te&s;tifying to any Man <HI>Thou art ju&s;tified;</HI> his Meaning is, <HI>Thou Believer art ju&s;tified.</HI> And I do be&s;eech the God and Father of all Lights, that his poor People may be led into the Truth in this Particular; for want of E&s;tabli&s;hment here, you little think how many Delu&s;ions you may fall into about your &s;piritual Condition; I remember that when Satan came to overthrow the Faith of Chri&s;t, in his &s;econd Temptation, <HI>Matth.</HI> 4.6. he brought a Promi&s;e out of the Scriptures to him, becau&s;e he &s;aw he held clo&s;e to them, <HI>ver.</HI> 4. and by this Promi&s;e &s;ought to lead him into Temptation; how &s;o? Ob|&s;erve the Text, and &s;ee if it was not by hiding Part of the Meaning of the Promi&s;e from him, and in &s;pecial that very Condition required in the Per&s;on to whom the Promi&s;e is made; for he tells him, that if he <HI>ca&s;t him&s;elf down headlong, the Lord hath not</HI> only &s;aid it, but <HI>writ it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he &s;hall give his Angels charge over him, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eep him from da&s;hing his Foot again&s;t a Stone:</HI> Whereas if you con&s;ult with the Place whence it is cited, <HI>viz.

It is believing to have the End by the Means, not the End without the Mean of Faith. It is true, we may &s;ee God's Favour and Love to us in the Cau&s;e as well as in the Effects of Sanctification; but what is that Cau&s;e? The meritorious Cau&s;e is Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the in&s;trumental Cau&s;e of applying this, is our Faith; &s;o that as we are ju&s;tified by Faith, &s;o &s;eeing this, we may &s;ay a&s;&s;uredly with <HI>Paul, Being ju&s;tified by Faith, we have Peace with God,</HI> Rom. 5.1. It is true, we cannot &s;ee our Ju&s;tification by Faith, nor the Work of Faith, with|out the &s;hining of the Spirit into our Hearts; but the Que&s;tion is not, whether the Spirit helps us to &s;ee our ju&s;tified E&s;tate, but by what Means; by what Pro|po&s;ition in the Word we come to &s;ee it; which we may &s;ay is not by any &s;uch ab&s;olute Te&s;timony: Thou art ju&s;tified already, and therefore believe; but if thou believe and come to Chri&s;t, here is then Pardon of Sin, Peace with God, yea, all the Ble&s;&s;ings of Chri&s;t ready for thee, which God intends to give and never to take away, if thou thankfully receive what God freely offers, and as it were lays down at thy Feet. The Call of Chri&s;t therefore is the Ground by which we fir&s;t believe; and that you may be con|firmed farther herein, do but con&s;ider the Glory and Excellency of this Ground.</P>

<PB N="190" REF="005059_0195_101696F44CF5BBD8">
as we are no &s;ooner Children of <HI>Adam,</HI> and Branches of that Root by natural Generation, but we imme|diately contract the Guilt of his Sin, and &s;o original Pollution; &s;o we are no &s;ooner made Branches of the &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI> by Vocation, and &s;o united unto Chri&s;t by Faith, but immediately we have the Imputation of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s to our Ju&s;tification, after which we receive in order of Nature (not Time) our Sanc|tification; there is no Truth more nece&s;&s;ary to be known than this, it being the principal Thing con|tained in the Go&s;pel, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.17. The Law &s;hewing how a Man may be ju&s;t and live; but it hath not the lea&s;t Word how a &s;inful Man may be ju&s;t and not die, this is proper to the Revelation of the Go&s;pel: Let me therefore give you a Ta&s;te of the Nature of it.</P>
<P>Our Ju&s;tification is wrought by a double Act. 1. On God the Father's Part, he by a gracious Sen|tence ab&s;olves and acquits a Sinner, and accepts of him as righteous. 2. On God the Son's Part, pro|curing the pa&s;&s;ing of this Sentence by his Satisfaction imputed and applied. The Father being the Per&s;on principally wronged, hath chief Power to forgive, yet in Ju&s;tice he cannot acquit, nor in Truth account a Man unrighteous as righteous, unle&s;s the Son &s;tep in and &s;atisfy; <HI>for who&s;e Sake he forgives;</HI> as the A|po&s;tle expre&s;ly &s;aith, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. <HI>ult.</HI> So that our Ju&s;ti|fication is wholly out of our &s;elves, and we are meer|ly pa&s;&s;ive in it. Ju&s;tification is not to make us in|wardly ju&s;t, as the Papi&s;t's Dream; but it is a Law-Term, and is oppo&s;ed again&s;t <HI>Condemnation,</HI> Rom. 8.33. Now look as <HI>Condemnation</HI> is the Sentence of the Judge, condemning a Man to die for his Offences, or Sin; &s;o <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> is the Sentence of God the Father, ab&s;olving a Man from the Guilt and Puni&s;h|ment
<PB N="191" REF="005059_0196_1016973C0B2437F8">
of Sin for the Sake of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t: That you may more particularly under&s;tand me, take this De&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>JUSTIFICATION is the gracious Sentence of GOD the FATHER, whereby, for the Satis|faction of CHRIST, apprehended by Faith, and imputed to the Faithful, he ab&s;olves them from the Guilt and Condemnation of all Sin, and accepts them as perfectly Righteous to eternal Life.</P>
<P>Let me open the Particulars herein briefly in &s;eve|ral Queries.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 1. What it is in general <HI>to ju&s;tify?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 'Tis to pa&s;s Sentence of Ab&s;olution; to pronounce a Sinner righteous; 'tis God's Pardon, Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins; this appears from the Oppo&s;ition mentioned it &s;tands in unto Condemnation, as a Judge Pardons a Man when he &s;aith he &s;hall live; or as a Man manife&s;tly forgives another when he gives him a Promi&s;e, or a Bill of Di&s;charge; &s;o that (note this by the Way that) our Ju&s;tification is not God's eternal Purpo&s;e to forgive, but it is God's Sentence publi&s;hed, a Sinner is ju&s;tified intentionally in Election, but not actually 'till this Sentence be pa&s;t and pub|li&s;hed; the only Difficulty here is, Where this Sen|tence is pronounced; for An&s;wer whereof note, that there is but a double Court wherein 'tis pa&s;&s;ed; 1. Publickly in the Court of Heaven, or in the Court-Rolls of the Word; (for there is no other Court of Heaven where God &s;peaks, but this.) 2. Privately, in the Court of Con&s;cience. By the fir&s;t we are ju&s;tified indeed from per&s;onal Guilt; by the &s;econd we feel our &s;elves ju&s;tified by the Removal of Con|&s;cience Guilt. The fir&s;t is expre&s;ly mentioned, <HI>Acts</HI> 10.43. and <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.17. The &s;econd is expre&s;ly &s;et
<PB N="192" REF="005059_0197_101696F7507FCCF8">
down al&s;o, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 32.4. The fir&s;t is the Cau&s;e and Foundation of the &s;econd; the &s;econd ari&s;eth from the fir&s;t: Otherwi&s;e, Peace of Con&s;cience is a meer Delu&s;ion: The fir&s;t is &s;ometimes long before the &s;e|cond, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 88.15. as the Sentence of Condemna|tion in the Word is &s;ometimes long before a Man feels that Sentence in his own Con&s;cience; the &s;econd comes in a long Time after in &s;ome Chri&s;tians: The fir&s;t is con&s;tant and unchangeable; the &s;econd very changeable: He that hath Peace in his Con&s;cience to Day, may lo&s;e it by to Morrow. So that you are not (in &s;eeking the Te&s;timony of our Ju&s;tification) to look for a Sentence from Heaven immediately pronounced of God, but look for it in the Court of his Word, (the Court of Heaven) which tho' we hear not, &s;ometime, yet it rings and fills Heaven and Earth with the Sound of it, <HI>viz. There is no Condemnation to them that believe:</HI> For hereby the Lord mercifully provideth for the Pence of his People more abundantly. As when a poor Creditor is acquitted, or a Male|factor pardoned, I be&s;eech you (&s;aith he) let me have an Acquittance, a Di&s;charge, a Pardon under your own Hand, and this quiets him again&s;t all Accu&s;ers: So 'tis here; the Lord gives us an Acquittance in his Word, under his own Hand and Seal, and &s;o gives us Peace, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.18.</P>
<P N="2">2. Who is it that ju&s;tifieth?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 'Tis <HI>God the Father,</HI> Rom. 8.34. <HI>Father forgive them,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t. And hence Chri&s;t <HI>is an Advocate with the Father,</HI> 1 John 2.2. All the three Per&s;ons were wronged by Sin; yet the Wrong was chiefly again&s;t the Father, becau&s;e his Manner of Working appear'd chiefly in Creation, from the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of which, Man fell by Sin. The Father forgives primarily by &s;overeign Authority;
<PB N="193" REF="005059_0198_10169740577F4DF8">
the Son of Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us forgives by immediate Di&s;pen&s;ation and Commi&s;&s;ion from the Father, <HI>John</HI> 5.22. <HI>Matth.</HI> 9.6. the Apo&s;tles and their Succe&s;&s;ors forgive mini&s;terially, <HI>John</HI> 21.23. The Father for|gives by granting Pardon, the Son by procuring, the Mini&s;ters (where the Spirit al&s;o is) by publi&s;hing or applying Pardon: So that this is great Con&s;olation, that God the Father the Party chiefly incen&s;ed, 'tis he that ju&s;tifieth, 'tis he that pa&s;&s;eth this gracious Sentence, and then who can condemn?</P>
<P N="3">3. Why doth the Father thus ju&s;tify?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 'Tis meerly his Grace, and out of Grace. And hence I call it his <HI>gracious Sentence,</HI> Rom. 3.24. <HI>ju&s;tified freely by his Grace.</HI> What is his <HI>Grace?</HI> The Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> expounds it to be not our Grace, or Works of Grace, (altho' wro't by Grace) but <HI>his own Names Sake,</HI> I&s;ai. 43.25. In &s;ome Re&s;pect indeed it is ju&s;t for God to forgive, <HI>viz.</HI> in Regard of Chri&s;t's Satisfaction, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.7. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.20. The Mercy Seat and the Tables of the Law in the Ark, may well &s;tand together, but that Chri&s;t was &s;ent to &s;atisfy Ju&s;tice, and that thy Sins were &s;atisfied for, and not anothers; thus it's wholly of Grace. If therefore you think the Lord pardons your Sins becau&s;e you have been le&s;s Sinners than others; or if you think the Lord will not pardon your Sins, be|cau&s;e you are greater Sinners than any el&s;e, you &s;in exceedingly again&s;t the Riches of God's Grace in this Point.</P>
<P N="4">4. What is the Mean by which the Father doth thus ju&s;tify?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 'Tis for the Sati&s;faction or by the Price of the Redemption of Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24. and 5.10. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.7. for Mercy would, but Ju&s;tice could not forgive, without Satisfaction for the Wrong done.
<PB N="194" REF="005059_0199_10169770B5978350">
Hence Chri&s;t &s;atisfies, that Grace and Mercy might have their full Scope of forgiving. So that, neither Works before Conver&s;ion, which are but gli&s;tering Sins, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.18. nor Works of Grace in us after Conver&s;ion, can be the Cau&s;es of our Ju&s;tification: For <HI>Abraham</HI> when he was ju&s;tified and &s;anctified, yet <HI>had not whereof to boa&s;t,</HI> but <HI>believed in him that ju&s;tified the Ungodly,</HI> Rom. 4.5. And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith expre&s;ly, <HI>We</HI> that believe <HI>have believed, that we might be ju&s;tified,</HI> Gal. 2.16. 'tis therefore the Price of Chri&s;t's Redemption which doth procure our Ju&s;|tification. But under&s;tand this aright, for this Price is not applied to each particular Man as the <HI>common Price,</HI> redeeming all, (for then every Believer &s;hould be accounted a Saviour and Redeemer of all) but as the Price of tho&s;e Souls in particular, to whom it is &s;pecially intended, and particularly applied. Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify all to whom it is imputed, but it is no further imputed than to the at|taining the End of Imputation, <HI>viz.</HI> to ju&s;tify and &s;ave me in particular, not to make me a Head of the Church or a common Saviour: It argues a Man weakly principled, that denies the Nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's Satisfaction to our Ju&s;tification, becau&s;e for&s;ooth every Believer &s;hould then be a Redeemer.</P>
<P>By <HI>Satisfaction</HI> I under&s;tand, the whole Obedience of Chri&s;t unto the very Death, which is both active and pa&s;&s;ive, by which we are ju&s;tified, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.10. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.8. That Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t (wro't in his Satisfaction) is imputed, which &s;atisfies the Law and divine Ju&s;tice, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.1, to 4. which is both active and pa&s;&s;ive: The very Rea&s;on why the Law requires perfect Obedience of us, which we cannot po&s;&s;ibly bring before God, is, that we might &s;eek for it in Chri&s;t, that fulfilled all Righteou&s;ne&s;s: And
<PB N="195" REF="005059_0200_10169786F140CF78">
therefore he is called <HI>the End of the Law for Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> Rom. 10.3, 4. And it is &s;trange that any &s;hould deny Ju&s;tification by Chri&s;t's active Obedience, upon this Ground, <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e that <HI>by the Works of the Law</HI> (which &s;atisfy the Law) <HI>&s;hall no Sinner be ju&s;tified;</HI> and yet withal &s;ay, that we are ju&s;tified by that which &s;atisfies the Law.</P>
<P>This Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is not that of the Godhead, (for then what need was there for Chri&s;t to do or &s;uffer?) but that which was wrought in the Manhood. And hence it is finite in it &s;elf, tho' in|finite in Value in that it was the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a Per&s;on. This Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God may be con|&s;idered two Ways, Fir&s;t, Ab&s;olutely, in it &s;elf, Se|condly, Re&s;pectively, as done for us.</P>
<P N="1">1. Chri&s;t's ab&s;olute Righteou&s;ne&s;s is not imputed to us, <HI>viz.</HI> as he is Mediator, Head of the Church, having the Spirit without Mea&s;ure (which is next to infinite) &amp;c. for tho' the&s;e Things are applied for our Good, yet they are not imputed as our Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and therefore the Objection vani&s;h|eth, which &s;aith we cannot be ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e it is of &s;uch infinite Perfection.</P>
<P N="2">2. The re&s;pective or di&s;pen&s;ative Righteou&s;ne&s;s which &s;ome call <HI>ju&s;titia fide ju&s;&s;oria,</HI> is that whereby Chri&s;t is ju&s;t <HI>for us</HI> in fulfilling the Law, in bearing God's Image, we once had, and have now lo&s;t by Sin; and thus we are truly &s;aid to be as righteous as Chri&s;t by Imputation, becau&s;e he kept the Law for us: And here ob&s;erve, that the Que&s;tion is not, whether all that Chri&s;t did and had is imputed to us as our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, but whether all that he did <HI>pro <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">bis,</HI> for us, as a Surety in fulfilling the Law, be not <HI>for Sub&s;tance,</HI> our Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and therefore to think that we are not ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,
<PB N="196" REF="005059_0201_10166680441E3300">
becau&s;e then we are ju&s;tified by his working of Miracles, preaching of Sermons, which Women are not regularly capable of, is but to ca&s;t Blocks before the Blind; &s;o that tho' Chri&s;t doth not be&s;tow his per&s;onal Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice upon another, yet what hinders, but that <HI>that</HI> which Chri&s;t doth by his Wi&s;|dom and Righteou&s;ne&s;s for another, the &s;ame &s;hould &s;tand good for him for whom it is done? For thus it is in &s;undry Ca&s;es among Men; Chri&s;t's e&s;&s;ential Righteou&s;ne&s;s, infinite Wi&s;dom, Fulne&s;s of Spirit without Mea&s;ure, &amp;c. is not imputed to us; yet the&s;e have con&s;pired together to do that for us, and &s;uffer that for us, by which we come to be accounted righteous before God: He &s;hall be called <HI>the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Jer. 23.6. This Righteou&s;ne&s;s therefore imputed to us ju&s;tifies us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.18. we are &s;aid to be made <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him;</HI> not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God whereby <HI>he is ju&s;t,</HI> but whereby <HI>we are ju&s;t;</HI> oppo&s;ed to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Man which is called <HI>our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Rom. 10.3. and 1.17. Not Righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>from</HI> him (as the Papi&s;t's dream) but Righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>in</HI> him; nor Re|mi&s;&s;ion by Chri&s;t only, but Righteou&s;ne&s;s in Chri&s;t; this imputed ju&s;tifies; as Sin imputed condemns.</P>
<P N="5">5. Who are the Per&s;ons the Lord doth ju&s;tify?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> They are Believers; we are ju&s;tified <HI>by Faith,</HI> Rom. 5. or, <HI>for Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s appre|hended by Faith,</HI> Phil. 3.9. it is by Faith not as a Work of Grace, but as by an In&s;trument appointed of God for this End. Chri&s;t did not die that our Sins &s;hould be actually and immediately pardoned, but mediately <HI>by Faith,</HI> John 3.16. and 17.20. and the Lord in Wi&s;dom hath appointed this as the only Means of applying Righteou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e this above all other Graces ca&s;ts down all the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of

<P N="6">6. What is the Extent of this Sentence?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The De&s;cription &s;aith, that Chri&s;t's Sa|tisfaction thus applied, the Father doth two Things,</P>
<P N="1">1. He ab&s;olves them from all Guilt and Condem|nation of Sin, &s;o that in this Sen&s;e, <HI>he &s;ees no Iniquity in Jacob,</HI> Cha&s;ti&s;ements they may now have after Ju&s;tification, but no Puni&s;hments; Cro&s;&s;es not Cur&s;es; &s;uch as de&s;troy their Sins, no Puni&s;hments to de&s;troy their Souls: Hence tho&s;e Phra&s;es in Scripture, <HI>Scat|tering Sins as a Mi&s;t, blotting them out, remembring them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o more, &s;etting them out as far as the Ea&s;t is from the We&s;t:</HI> For Chri&s;t being made Sin for his People, and this being imputed, he <HI>aboli&s;hing all Sin, by one Offe|ring,</HI> Heb. 10. Hence all are forgiven; and hence it is that there can be no Suit in Law again&s;t a Sinner, the Law being &s;atisfied, and the Sinner ab&s;olved; nay, hence Sin is condemned, and the Sinner &s;pared, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.3. as Chri&s;t died for us, &s;o he was acquitted for us, and we in him; we in him in Redemption,

<P N="1">1. That the Sentence of Pardon of all thy Sins is at an In&s;tant, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. but not the Sen&s;e nor Exe|cution of Pardon: Actual Sentence of Pardon, not actual Application of Pardon, till they be actually committed, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.13. <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.12. and 10.1, 2. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25. There is a Pardon of Cour&s;e (&s;ome &s;ay) for Sins of Infirmities, I &s;ay there is al&s;o a Par|don of Cour&s;e for Sins of Wilfulne&s;s, all Manner of Sins; but not Sen&s;e of Pardon always.</P>
<P N="2">2. He accepts and accounts us perfectly Righte|ous, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.3. Faith <HI>is accounted for Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> not the Act of Faith; as the <HI>Arminians</HI> would, but the Object of it apprehended by Faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.17. The Lord accounts us as Righteous thro' Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as if we had kept all the Law, &s;uffered all the Puni&s;hments for the Breach of it; <HI>Who can lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect,</HI> whom God hath <HI>ju&s;tified?</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. Satan may an&s;wer, Yes I can, for the Law &s;aith, <HI>The Soul that &s;ins mu&s;t die:</HI> Chri&s;t an&s;wers, but I have died for him, and &s;atisfied the utmo&s;t Farthing to Ju&s;tice in that Point: True, my Satan &s;ay, here is Satisfaction for the Offence, but the Law mu&s;t be kept al&s;o; the Lord Chri&s;t an&s;wers, I am the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, I am perfectly holy and righteous, not for my &s;elf, (for I am a common Per&s;on) but for this poor Sinner who in him&s;elf is exceedingly and wholly polluted; and hence the Lord covers Sins, as well as pardons Sins; <HI>cloaths</HI> us with Chri&s;t, as well as remits Sin for Chri&s;t's Sake; and as we are account|ed Sinners by Imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s legal Unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s,
<PB N="199" REF="005059_0204_1016978B25BDC228">
&s;o are we accounted Righteous by the &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI>'s legal Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and that unto eternal Life, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.17, 18. Thus you &s;ee <HI>the Nature,</HI> now the Lord opens your Eyes to &s;ee <HI>the Glory</HI> of this Privilege; you that never felt the heavy Load of Sin, the Terrors of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Con&s;cience ari&s;ing from the Sen&s;e of an angry God, cannot prize this Privilege; but if you have, you cannot but &s;ay as he did, <HI>O ble&s;&s;ed are they who&s;e Iniquities are forgiven, and who&s;e Sin is covered;</HI> and again, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man to whom the Lord imputes no Sin,</HI> P&s;al. 32.12. The Lord pity us; how many be there in the&s;e Times, that know there is no Ju&s;tification but by Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and yet e&s;teem it not? Let me there|fore give you one Glimp&s;e of the Glory of it in the&s;e Particulars,</P>
<P N="1">1. This is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s by which <HI>a Sinner</HI> is Righteous: The Law &s;hews you how a Man may be Righteous, but there is not the lea&s;t Tittle of the Law, which &s;hews you how <HI>a Sinner</HI> may become Righteous, this never could have entred into the Thoughts of Angels how this could be; it is cro&s;s to Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on, for a Man accur&s;ed and &s;inful in him&s;elf, to be at that very Time ble&s;&s;ed and righteous in another; to &s;ay, <HI>Lord, Depart from me, for I am a &s;inful Man,</HI> Luke 5.8. is the Voice of natural Con&s;cience awakened, not only concerning God out of Chri&s;t, but even when God appears in Chri&s;t as he did then to <HI>Peter;</HI> but that the Lord &s;hould become our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, when we think no Sinners like our &s;elves, no Ca&s;es, no Afflictions, no De&s;ertions like ours; who can believe this? Yet thus it is; the very Scope of the fourth Chapter to the <HI>Romans,</HI> Rom. 4.5. is not to &s;hew how a ju&s;t Man may be made Righ|teous, but how <HI>a Sinner</HI> may; our own Duties, Works,
<PB N="200" REF="005059_0205_10169745DF729920">
and Reformation, may make us at the be&s;t but le&s;s &s;inful, but this Righteou&s;ne&s;s makes a Sinner &s;inle&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. By this a Sinner is Righteous before the Judg|ment Seat of God: What Man that hath Awaken|ings of Con&s;cience, but trembles exceedingly when he con&s;iders the Judgment Seat of God, and of his &s;trict Account there? But by this we can look upon the Face of the Judge him&s;elf with Boldne&s;s. <HI>It is God that ju&s;tifies, who &s;hall condemn?</HI> Rom. 8.32. Can Chri&s;t condemn? He is our Advocate. Can Sin condemn? Why did Chri&s;t die and was made Sin then? Can Satan condemn, if God him&s;elf ju&s;tify us? If the Judge acquits us, what can the Jaylor do? Can the Law condemn? No, the Lord Chri&s;t hath fulfilled it for us, to the utmo&s;t: Oh the Stings that many have, &s;aying, What &s;hall I do when I die and go down to the Du&s;t? May not the Lord have &s;ome|thing again&s;t me at the Day of Reckoning that I ne|ver &s;aw, nor got cancelled? O poor Creatures! Is Chri&s;t now before God without Spot? Hath he cleared all Reckonings? Verily as he is before him, &s;o are you; thro' that Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is in him for you.</P>
<P N="3">3. By this you have perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as per|fectly Righteous, as Chri&s;t <HI>the Righteous,</HI> 1 John 2.1, 2, and 3.7. All yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> own Righteou&s;ne&s;s tho' it be the Fruit of the Spirit of Grace, is a blotted, &s;tained Righteou&s;ne&s;s, very imperfect and little; but by this the Faith of <HI>David, Peter, Paul,</HI> was not more pre|cious than thine is, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t the &s;ame Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s as they had, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2. What &s;incere Soul but e&s;teems of perfect Holine&s;s more than of Heaven it &s;elf? Oh con&s;ider thou ha&s;t it (in this Sen&s;e I now &s;peak of) in the Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="4">4. By this you have continual Righteou&s;ne&s;s. What do&s;t thou complain of daily? Is it not becau&s;e thou

feele&s;t new Sins, or the &s;ame Sins confe&s;&s;ed, and la|mented, and in Part &s;ubdued; nay, &s;ome to thy feeling wholly &s;ubdued; but they return upon thee again, and the Springs in the Bottom fill thy Soul again, that thou art weary of thy Self and Life. O but remember, this is not a Ci&s;tern, but <HI>a Fountain opened,</HI> Zech. 13.1. for thee to wa&s;h in; as <HI>Sin a|bounds,</HI> &s;o <HI>Grace</HI> in this Gift of Righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>abounds much more;</HI> the Lord hath <HI>Changes of Garments</HI> for thee, <HI>Zech.</HI> 3.1, to 7. by Means of which, there &s;hall never enter into the Lord's Heart, one hard Tho't toward thee of ca&s;ting thee off, or of taking Revenge, upon any new Occa&s;ion or Fall into Sin.</P>
<P N="5">5. By this you have eternal Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that never can be lo&s;t: If the Lord &s;hould make thee as perfectly Righteous as once <HI>Adam</HI> was, or Angels in Heaven are, and put on thy royal Apparel again, thou wa&s;t in danger of lo&s;ing this, and of being &s;tript naked again; but now the Lord hath put your Righteou&s;|ne&s;s into a &s;afer Hand which never &s;hall be lo&s;t, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.12. <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.24.</P>
<P N="6">6. By this you plea&s;e God, and are more amiable before him, than if you had it in your &s;elf; Do not &s;ay this is a poor Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is thus out of thy &s;elf in another; why do you think Righteou&s;ne&s;s in your &s;elf would be be&s;t?

I tell you when you bring this Offering of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, the Lord had rather have that, than all you can do, you bring that which plea&s;eth him more, than if you bro't your own. For a&s;k thy own Con&s;cience, if it be po&s;&s;ible for the Righteou&s;ne&s;s that is done by thy &s;elf to be more plea&s;ing to God, than the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Son of God, the Lord of Glory him&s;elf, done and perfected for thee.</P>
<P N="7">7. By this you glorify God exceedingly, as <HI>Abra|ham believed,</HI> Rom. 4. <HI>and gave Glory unto God. In the Lord &s;hall all the Seed of I&s;rael be ju&s;tified, and &s;hall Glory,</HI> I&s;ai. 45.15.</P>

Behold the Way, if thou can&s;t not do it by Obedience, thou may&s;t by Faith: And thereby make Re&s;titution of all God's Glory lo&s;t and &s;tolen from him by thy Di&s;obedience to him.</P>
<P N="8">8. By this you have Peace in your Con&s;ciences; by this, Chri&s;t's Blood is &s;prinkled upon them, and that cools the burning Torments of them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.1. The Commers unto the levitical Sacrifices and Wa&s;h|ings, (Types of this Offering of Chri&s;t) could not thereby be perfected and be without the guilty Con|&s;cience of Sin: None of your Duties can pacify Con|&s;cience, but as they carry you hither to this Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s: but the Commers to this have no more Ter|rors of Con&s;cience for Sin, I mean they have no ju&s;t Cau&s;e to have any; this <HI>Rain-bow</HI> appearing over your Heads, is a certain Sign of fair Weather, and that there &s;hall be no more <HI>Deluge</HI> of Wrath to over|whelm thee.</P>

<P>_THIS is the &s;econd Benefit which in Order of Nature follows our Ju&s;tification, altho' &s;ome|times in a large Sen&s;e it is taken for the whole Work of Ju&s;tification, &s;trictly taken, it follows it, Rom. 5.1. <HI>Being ju&s;tified by Faith, we have Peace with God, i. e.</HI> not only Peace from God in our Con|&s;ciences, but Peace with God in our Reconcilement to him, and his Favour toward us: <HI>Being ju&s;tified, we &s;hall be &s;aved from Wrath, i. e.</HI> not only the out|ward Fruits of Wrath, but Wrath from whence tho&s;e come; Chri&s;t is fir&s;t <HI>King of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> then <HI>King of Peace,</HI> Heb. 7.2.

Chri&s;t is a Propitiation by Faith, and here the Malefactor hath Tidings of Favour, if he will accept of it, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.15, 17. and of this I now &s;peak: God and Man were once Friends, but by Sin a great Breach is made, the Lord only bearing the Wrongs is ju&s;tly provoked, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 65.2, 3. Man that only doth the Wrong is notwith&s;tanding at En|mity

with him, and will not be intreated to accept of Favour, much le&s;s to repent of this Wrong, <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. the Lord Je&s;us therefore heals this Breach, by being Mediator between both; he takes up the Quarrel, and fir&s;t reconciles God to Man, and Man to God, <HI>in him&s;elf,</HI> in Redemption, and after this reconciles God and Man <HI>by him&s;elf</HI> in (or imme|diately upon) our Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>This Reconciliation con&s;i&s;ts in two Things chiefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. In our Peace with God, whereby the Lord lays by all Acts of Ho&s;tility again&s;t us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the Love and Favour of God. I do not mean God's Love of <HI>Good-will,</HI> for this is in Election, but his Love of <HI>Complai&s;ency</HI> and <HI>Delight,</HI> for 'till we are ju&s;tified, the Lord behaves him&s;elf as an Enemy and Stranger to us who are polluted before him, but then he begins thus to love us, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4.10, 16. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.21, 22. A Gardiner may intend to turn a Crab-tree Stock into an Apple-tree, his Intention doth not alter the Nature of it until it be actually ingraffed up|on: So we are <HI>by Nature the Children of Wrath,</HI> Eph. 1.3. The Intention of God the Father, or his Love of Good-will, doth not make us Children of Favour and Sons of Peace, until the Lord actually call us to and ingrafft us into Chri&s;t, and then as Chri&s;t is <HI>the Delight of God,</HI> &s;o we in him are loved with the &s;ame Love of De|light, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 4.1, 2. Peace with God, and Love of God, are different Degrees of our Reconciliation: A Prince is at Peace, or cea&s;eth War, again&s;t a Re|bel, yet he may not bring the Rebel before him, into his Bo&s;om of &s;pecial Favour, Delight, and Love; but the Lord doth both, towards us Enemies, Strangers, Rebels, Devils, in our Reconciliation with him.</P>
<P N="5">5. Oh con&s;ider what a ble&s;&s;ed E&s;tate this is to be at Peace with God: It was the Title of Honour the

<P N="1">1. That God &s;hould be pacified with thee after An|ger, this is exceeding glorious, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 12.1, 2.

<P N="2">2. That the Lord &s;hould be pacified wholly and thoro'ly, that there &s;hould be no Anger left for you to feel.

into, this is wonderful: Tho&s;e whom Men love they for&s;ake, if their Love be abu&s;ed; or if their Friends be in Affliction, they then bid them good Night; but the Lord's Love and Favour is everla&s;ting, I&s;ai. 9.7. <HI>The Mountains may depart out of their Places, and the Hills ca&s;t down to Valleys, but the Lord's Kindne&s;s never &s;hall, never can; he hath hid his Face a little Moment,</HI> I&s;ai. 45.10. whiles thou did&s;t live in thy Sin and Un|belief, but now, <HI>with everla&s;ting Mercy will he em|brace thee;</HI> nay, which is more, <HI>the abounding of thy Sin</HI> is now the Occa&s;ion <HI>of the abounding of his Grace,</HI> Rom. 5.20. thy very Wants and Mi&s;eries are the very Cau&s;es of his Bowels and tender Mercies, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.15, 16.

<P N="4">4. That the Lord &s;hould be thus pacified with Enemies; a Man may be ea&s;ily pacified with one that offends him a little, but with an Enemy that &s;trikes at his Life, (as by every Sin you do) this is wonderful, yet this is the Ca&s;e here, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.7, 8.</P>

<P N="6">6.

<P>I have oft wondered, If Chri&s;t hath born all our Mi&s;eries and &s;uffered Death for us, why then &s;hould we feel any Mi&s;eries or &s;ee Death any more?

<HEAD>SECT. III Thirdly, <HI>Adoption.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THIS is the third Benefit, which in order of Nature follows our Reconciliation, whereby the Lord accounts us Sons, and gives us the Spirit and Privilege of Sons: For in order, we mu&s;t be fir&s;t beloved before we can be loved &s;o as to be ac|counted Sons, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.1, 2. For the Lord of un|ju&s;t to account us <HI>ju&s;t</HI> in our Ju&s;tification is much; but for the Lord to account us hereby as <HI>Friends,</HI> this is more: But to account us <HI>Sons</HI> al&s;o, this is a higher Degree and a farther Privilege; and hence our Adoption follows our Faith, <HI>John</HI> 1.12. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.26.
<PB N="211" REF="005059_0216_1016979E3A62BF30">
And if Adoption, then the Spirit of Adoption much le&s;s doth not precede Faith. By Chri&s;t's active Obe|dience (our Divines &s;ay) we have right unto Life; by Adoption we have a farther right; the one de|&s;troys not the other; for a Man may have right un|to the &s;ame Thing upon &s;undry Grounds: We know there are two Sorts of Sons: 1. Some by Nature, born of our own Bodies, and thus we are not Sons of God, but Children of Wrath. 2. Some by Adop|tion, which are taken out of another Family, and ac|counted freely of us as our Sons; and thus <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was for a Time the Son of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Daughter. And of this Son-&s;hip by Adoption I now &s;peak, the Lord ta|king us out of the Family of Hell to be his adopted Sons. Chri&s;t is God's Son by eternal Generation, <HI>Adam</HI> by Creation; all Believers are Sons by Adop|tion. Now Adoption is two-fold,</P>
<P N="1">1. External, whereby the Lord takes a People by outward Covenant and Di&s;pen&s;ation to be his Sons, and thus all the Jews were God's <HI>fir&s;t-born,</HI> Exod. 4.22. and unto him did <HI>belong the Adoption,</HI> Rom. 9.4, 5. And hence their Children were accounted <HI>Sons,</HI> as well as Saints, and <HI>holy,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.14. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.20, 21. but many fall from this Adoption, as the Jews did.</P>
<P N="2">2. Internal, whereby the Lord out of everla&s;ting Love to particular Per&s;ons in &s;pecial, he takes them out of the Family of Satan, and by internal Love and &s;pecial Account reckons them in the Number of Sons; makes them indeed <HI>Sons,</HI> as well as calls them &s;o, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 56.5. <HI>I&s;aac</HI> by &s;pecial Promi&s;e was <HI>accounted for the Seed,</HI> Rom. 9.8. and of this we now &s;peak. Now this is double,</P>
<P N="1">1. Adoption begun, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.1, 2. now we are the Sons of God. To &s;ome of which, (tho' Sons indeed) yet the Lord behaves him&s;elf toward them for &s;ome Time, and for &s;pecial Rea&s;ons, as unto <HI>Servants,</HI>
<PB N="212" REF="005059_0217_10169758A5444498">
exerci&s;ing them with many Fears, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.1, 2. Some Spirits will not be the better for the Love of their Fa|ther, but wor&s;e; and therefore the Lord keeps a hard Hand over them: to others, the Lord behaves him&s;elf with more &s;pecial Re&s;pect, in making them cry with more Boldne&s;s, <HI>Abba, Father,</HI> Rom. 8.15, 16. who will be more ea&s;ily overcome, and bent to his Will, by Love.</P>
<P N="2">2. Adoption perfected, when we &s;hall receive all the Privileges of Sons, not one excepted, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.23. where we are &s;aid <HI>to wait for our Adoption, the Redemp|tion of our Bodies;</HI> by the fir&s;t we are Sons, but not &s;een nor known &s;uch, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.1, 2. By the &s;econd, we &s;hall be known before all the World to be &s;uch: We now &s;peak principally of Adoption begun, where|by we are Sons in God's Account, and by real Re|ception of the Spirit of Sons: The Manner of this Adoption is thus,</P>
<P N="1">1. God loves Je&s;us Chri&s;t with an un&s;peakable Love, as his only Son, and as our elder Brother.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence when we are in Chri&s;t his Son, he loves us with the &s;ame Love, as he doth his own Son.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence the Lord accounts us Sons, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.5, 6. God's Love is not now toward us as to <HI>Adam</HI> his Son by Creation, <HI>viz.</HI> immediately diffu&s;ed upon us; but in loving his own Son immediately, hence he loves us, and hence adopts us, and accounts us Children.</P>
<P>Oh that the Lord would open our Eyes to &s;ee this Privilege; <HI>Behold it,</HI> &s;aith <HI>John,</HI> 1 John 3.1. Stand amazed at it, that Children of Wrath &s;hould become the Sons of the mo&s;t high God; for a Beggar on the Dunghil, a Vagabond, Runnagate from God, a Pro|digal, a Stranger to God, whom the Lord hath no Cau&s;e to think on, to be made a Son of God almighty.</P>
<P>If Sons, then the Lord doth prize and e&s;teem you as Sons: If a Man hath twenty Sons, he e&s;teems the

<P>If Sons, then the Lord &s;urely will take Care for you as for Sons; a godly Father hath a double Care of his Children. Fir&s;t, of their Temporal, Secondly, and chiefly of their eternal E&s;tate: We are ready to que&s;|tion in Times of Want, what we &s;hall eat, drink, how we &s;hall live; Oh con&s;ider, art thou a Son of God, and will not he that <HI>feeds the Ravens, and cloaths the Lillies,</HI> Mat. 6.31, 32. provide for thee?

It is true, you may be bro't into outward Straits, Wants, Mi&s;eries, yet then the Lord is thereby plotting for thy eternal Good, for hence come all God's Corrections, <HI>Deut.</HI> 8.5. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.8. the Lord took all they had from them by their Enemies in War, and carried them away Captive into a &s;trange Land, yet <HI>Jer.</HI> 24.5. this was for their Good; we think the Lord many Times takes no Care for us, and &s;o make him of a wor&s;e Na|ture than the &s;avage Bea&s;ts, or bloody Men toward their young, but this is certain, he never denies any Thing to us in outward Things, but it is to further our eternal Bli&s;s with him, to do us Good in our latter End: What &s;ay godly Parents? It is no Matter what be|comes of my Children, when I am dead, if the Lord will but give them him&s;elf to be their Portion; if at la&s;t they may &s;ee the Lord in Glory: Do not wonder then if the Lord keeps you &s;hort &s;ometimes.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="005059_0219_1016975A2E0EB5E0">If Sons, then he loves you as Sons, as a Father doth his Sons; you think the Lord loves you not, becau&s;e you do not alway feel his Love, nor know his Love; is thy Son not thy Child, becau&s;e while it is young, it knows not the Father that begat it, or becau&s;e thou art &s;ometime departed from it, and ha&s;t it not alway in thine own Arms? <HI>I&s;rael &s;aith, My God hath for|&s;aken me and forgotten me,</HI> I&s;ai. 49.14. and yet no Mother tenders her Child, as the Lord did them; you think becau&s;e you have &s;o many Sins &amp; Afflictions one upon another, that the Lord loves you not: Judge righteou&s;ly, hath thy Child no Father becau&s;e it is &s;ick long together, and therefore kept under a &s;pare Diet?

<P>_THIS is the fourth Benefit which follows in Order of Nature, our Ju&s;tification, Re|conciliation, and Adoption, for upon our being Sons in Adoption, we receive the Image of our heavenly Father in Sanctification; be|cau&s;e we are under Grace. Hence it comes to pa&s;s that we are freed from the <HI>reigning Power of Sin,</HI> Rom. 6.14. &s;o that our Sanctification follows our Ju&s;tifica|tion, and Adoption, goes not before it. In ju&s;tifica|tion, we have the Love and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Son; in Reconciliation, the Love of the Father; in Adop|tion,
<PB N="217" REF="005059_0222_101697A4B7AC1340">
the Love of a Father and Pre&s;ence of the Spirit a&s;&s;i&s;ting, witne&s;&s;ing; in Sanctification, the Image of our Father by the &s;ame Spirit: And this I conceive, with Submi&s;&s;ion, is <HI>the Seal of the Spirit,</HI> mentioned, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.13. the <HI>Seal &s;ealing,</HI> is the Spirit it &s;elf; the <HI>Seal &s;ealed,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts fir&s;t in the Expre&s;&s;ion of it in A|doption; &s;econdly, in the Impre&s;&s;ion of it in Sanctifi|cation, and that he only &s;hall pa&s;s as current Coin, that hath both the&s;e: I know the mo&s;t full and clear Expre&s;&s;ion &amp; Te&s;timony of the Spirit is after all God's Work is fini&s;hed in Glorification, but the Beginning of it is here in Adoption, a full Mea&s;ure of it in Sanc|tification; God's Seal is ever &s;et to &s;ome Purpo&s;e (as Men's Seals to &s;ome Bonds, not to Blanks) the Lord's Promi&s;e of actual Ju&s;tification and Reconciliation, pertains only to Men &s;anctified or called: In Adop|tion therefore we receive the Spirit, which looks both Ways; te&s;tifying either thou &s;anctified, art ju&s;tified, or thou called, art ju&s;tified and reconciled.</P>
<P>I &s;peak not now of external Sanctification by out|ward Shew and Profe&s;&s;ion, and common Illumination and Operation of the Spirit <HI>upon Men,</HI> from which many fall away, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.29. but of internal and &s;pe|cial; the Nature of which, you may be&s;t conceive in the&s;e three Degrees,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is the <HI>renewing of a Man,</HI> Tit. 3.5. So that by it a Man is morally made a new Man, another Man; <HI>all Things are become new,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.27. he hath new Thoughts, new Opinions of Things, new De&s;ires, new Prayers, and Prai&s;es, new Di&s;po&s;itions, Regeneration not differing from it.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a <HI>renewing of the whole Man,</HI> 1 The&s;. 5.23. For as every Part and Faculty of Man is corrupt by the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;o they are renewed by the &s;econd <HI>Adam;</HI> not that we are perfectly renewed in this Life
<PB N="218" REF="005059_0223_1016975E5FF676F0">
by Chri&s;t, as we are corrupt by <HI>Adam,</HI> but in Part in every Faculty, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.19. and from hence ari&s;eth our &s;piritual Combat and Warfare with Sin, yea with all Sin; it is not becau&s;e of our Sanctification &s;imply (for if it were perfect, we &s;hould War and Wre&s;tle no more;) but from the Imperfection of it. And this renewal in Part, is in every Part, even in the whole Man: And as the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> propagates Sin chiefly and radically in the Soul, e&s;pecially into the Heart of Man; and from thence it diffu&s;eth it &s;elf like Leaven into the whole Lump of our Lives, &s;o the Lord Je&s;us chiefly communicates this Renewal into our Hearts, and thence it &s;weetens our Lives; and hence it is called <HI>the inner Man,</HI> Rom. 7.22. Eph. 3.16. You &s;ee a little Holine&s;s in a Chri&s;tian; I tell you, if he be of the right Make, there is a Kind of infinite endle&s;s Holine&s;s within him from whence it &s;prings, as there is a Kind of infinite endle&s;s Wick|ekne&s;s in a wicked Man, from whence his Sin &s;pring: If a Man be outwardly holy, but not within, he is not &s;anctified, no more than the painted Sepulchres of the proud Phari&s;ees; if any Man &s;ay his Heart is good, tho' he makes no Shew in his Life, he &s;peaks not the Truth, if the Apo&s;tle may be believed, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.6. for Sanctification is the Renewal of the whole Man, within and without; it is not for a Man to have his Teeth white, his Tongue tipt, and his Nails pared; no, no, the Lord makes all new where he comes.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is a Renewal unto the Image of God, or of God in Chri&s;t; an un&s;anctified Man may be after a Sort renewed in the whole Man, his outward Con|ver&s;ation may be fair, his Mind may be <HI>enlightned,</HI> his Heart may <HI>ta&s;te of the heavenly Gift,</HI> Heb. 6.4, 5. he may have <HI>a Form of Godline&s;s,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.5. he may have &s;trong Re&s;olutions within him unto Godline&s;s,

<HI>Deut.</HI> 5.29. And hence with the five fooli&s;h Virgins, may be received into the Fellow&s;hip of the Wi&s;e, and not di&s;cerned of them neither, till the Gate is &s;hut; but they are never renewed in their whole Man <HI>after the Image of God,</HI> i. e. they do not know Things, and judge of them as God doth, they do not Love and Will Holine&s;s and the Means thereto, as God doth; they hate not Sin, as God doth; they do not delight in the whole Law of God, it is not writ in their Hearts, and hence they love it not as God doth: And this is the Cut of the Thread between a &s;anctified and un|&s;anctified Spirit; by Sanctification a Man is renewed unto God's Image, once lo&s;t, but here again re&s;tored, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4, 24. <HI>John</HI> 1.16. we receive from Chri&s;t Grace for Grace, as the Seal on the Wax hath Tittle for Tittle, to that in the Seal it &s;elf, we are changed into the &s;ame Image of Chri&s;t by beholding him in the Gla&s;s of the Go&s;pel, by Faith, 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>I delight in the Law of my God in my inward Man,</HI> Rom. 7.23. And hence a Chri&s;tian by the Life of Sanctification, lives like unto God; at lea&s;t hath a holy Di&s;po&s;ition and Inclination (the Habits of Holine&s;s) &s;o to do, Gal. 2.19. <HI>I live unto God, he calleth us from Darkne&s;s into his marvellous Light, that we might &s;hew forth his Vertues;</HI> and that this is true Sanctification, may thus appear; becau&s;e our Sanctification is oppo&s;ed to our original Corruption, as our Ju&s;tification to our original and contracted Guilt of Sin: Now as original Corruption is the defacing of God's Image by contrary Di&s;po&s;i|tions to Sinfulne&s;s, &s;o our Sanctification can be no|thing el&s;e but the Removal of this Pollution, by the contrary Habits and Di&s;po&s;itions to be like unto God again: Our Sanctification is to be holy, <HI>Lev.</HI> 20.7. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.14, 15, 16. our Holine&s;s hath no other pri|mary Pattern but God's Holine&s;s, &s;o that our Sanctifi|cation
<PB N="220" REF="005059_0225_1016976043186F48">
is not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s as it is in|herent in Chri&s;t, for that is the Matter of our Ju&s;tifi|cation, and therefore Sanctification mu&s;t be that Ho|line&s;s which is derived unto us from Chri&s;t, whereby we are made like unto him; and thus Chri&s;t is made <HI>Sanctification unto us,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.30. There &s;hould be no Difference between Chri&s;t our Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Sanctification, if that Holine&s;s which is in Chri&s;t &s;hould be <HI>both</HI> unto us. Hence al&s;o Sanctification is not the immediate Operation of the Spirit upon us, without created Habits of Grace abiding in us, as the Spirit that came upon <HI>Balaam,</HI> and mightily affected him for a Time, but left him as de&s;titute of any Grace or Change of his Nature as the A&s;s he rode on; no, no, it renews you unto the Image of God him&s;elf, if you be truly &s;anctified. And therefore let all the&s;e Dreams of the <HI>Famili&s;ts</HI> (denying all inherent Graces, but only tho&s;e which are in Chri&s;t, to be in the Saints) let them vani&s;h and peri&s;h from under the Sun, and the good Lord reduce all &s;uch who in Simplicity are mi&s;led from this ble&s;&s;ed Truth of God. I will not now enter into the Depth concerning the Means of our Sanctification in Mortification by Chri&s;t's Death and Vivication by the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t: This may &s;uffice for Ex|plication of the Nature of it.</P>
<P>Only &s;ee and for ever prize this Privilege, all you ble&s;&s;ed Souls, whom the Lord hath ju&s;tified; thou ha&s;t many &s;ad Complaints, what is it to me, if I be ju&s;tified in Chri&s;t, and be &s;aved at la&s;t by Chri&s;t, and my Heart remain all this while unholy &amp; un&s;ubdued unto the Will of Chri&s;t; that he &s;hould comfort me, and my holy Heart be alway grieving of him; what tho' the Lord &s;ave me from Mi&s;ery, but &s;aves me not from my Sin; Oh con&s;ider this Benefit.

<P N="1">1. By this thou ha&s;t a mo&s;t &s;weet and comfortable evidence of thy Ju&s;tification and Favour with God; he that denies this, mu&s;t (whatever Di&s;tinctions he hath) aboli&s;h many Places of Scripture, e&s;pecially the Epi&s;tles of <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> who had to do with &s;ome Spirits, that pretended Faith and Union to Chri&s;t, and Communion with him, and &s;o long as it was thus, this was Evidence &s;ufficient to them of their ju&s;tified E&s;tates.

What &s;aid <HI>John?</HI> You talk (&s;aid he) of <HI>Fellow&s;hip and Communion with Chri&s;t,</HI> and yet what Holine&s;s is there in your Hearts and Lives; <HI>if you &s;ay you have Fellow&s;hip with him, and walk in Darkne&s;s, you lie, and do not the Truth; but if you walk in the Light,</HI> then al|tho' your Holine&s;s, and Confe&s;&s;ion, and daily Repen|tance for Sin doth not wa&s;h away Sin, yet <HI>the Blood of Chri&s;t doth wa&s;h us,</HI> 1 John 1.6, 7.

that he knows him not, and that he is not u|nited unto him; but is this any Evidence that we do know him, and that we are united to him, if we do keep his Commandments? Yes verily, &s;aith the A|po&s;tle, <HI>Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments,</HI> ver 3. and again ver. 5. <HI>Hereby know we that we are in him:</HI> What can be more plain? What a Vanity is this to &s;ay, that this is running upon a Covenant of Works? Is not Sanctification <HI>the writing of the Law in our Hearts,</HI> a &s;pecial Benefit of the Covenant of Grace, as well as Ju&s;tification? <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.10, 12. and can the evidencing then of one Benefit of &s;uch a Covenant by another, be a running upon the Covenant of Works? Is it a Truth contain|ed in the Covenant of Grace, <HI>viz.</HI> That he that is ju&s;tified is al&s;o &s;anctified, and he that is &s;anctified is al|&s;o ju&s;tified? And is it an Error again&s;t Grace to &s;ee this Truth, That he that is &s;anctified is certainly ju&s;ti|fied; and that therefore he that knows him&s;elf &s;anc|tified, may al&s;o know thereby that he is ju&s;tified? Tell me how will you know that you are ju&s;tified? You will &s;ay, by the Te&s;timony of the Spirit; and cannot the &s;ame Spirit &s;hine upon your Graces, and witne&s;s that you are &s;anctified as well? 1 <HI>John</HI> 4.13, 24. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.12.

<P>_THIS is the fifth Benefit, which tho' it be a Fruit of other Benefits, yet I name it in &s;pecial, becau&s;e I de&s;ire it may be e&s;pecially ob&s;erved; and I place it after our Sanctifi|cation, becau&s;e of <HI>David</HI>'s Speech; <HI>If I regard Iniquity in my Heart, the Lord will not hear my Prayer,</HI> P&s;al. 66.18.

<P N="2">2.

act by Faith, (for <HI>without me you can do nothing,</HI> John 15.5.) We are not united to Chri&s;t our Life by O|bedience, as <HI>Adam</HI> was to God by it, but by Faith: And therefore as all Action (in living Things) comes from Union, &s;o all our Acts of Obedience are to come from Faith, from the Spirit on Chri&s;t's Part, and from Faith on our Part, which make our Union: <HI>Noah</HI> built by Faith, <HI>Enoch</HI> walked with God by Faith, <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and his Soldiers fought by Faith, <HI>Abraham</HI> tra|velled, dwelt in his Tents, lived and died by Faith; they acted according to the Rule, but all by the Power of Faith. It is a weak Rea&s;oning, to imagine a Man is not bound to pay his Debts becau&s;e he is to go unto another for the Money: Obedience is our Debt we owe to Chri&s;t, <HI>Luke</HI> 17.10. tho' we are to go to Chri&s;t poor, and weak, and feeble, to enable us to pay: 'Tis true, Chri&s;t hath kept the Law for us, and are we therefore free from it as our Rule; No verily, Chri&s;t kept the Law for Sati&s;faction to Ju&s;tice, and &s;o we are not bound to keep the Law; he kept the Law al&s;o for Imitation, to give us a Copy and an Ex|ample of all Holine&s;s and glorifying God in our Obe|dience; and thus Chri&s;t's Obedience is &s;o far from exempting us from the Law, as that it engageth us the more, having both Rule and Example before us, 1 <HI>John.</HI> 2.6. <HI>He that &s;aith he abideth in him ought to walk as he walked,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.14, 15, 16.

Bring the Law into thy Con&s;cience in Point of Ju&s;tification, it will trouble Con&s;cience: For there only Chri&s;t's Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, God's Grace, &amp; the Promi&s;e are to be looked on, and our own Obedience &amp; Holine&s;s laid by in the Du&s;t; but bring it before thee as a Rule of thy Sancti|fication, and as thy Copy to write after, &amp; to imitate, and a&s;pire after that Perfection it requires, it will then trouble thee no more, than it doth a Child, who having a fair Copy &s;et him to write after, and knowing that he is a Son, is not therefore troubled, becau&s;e he cannot write as fair as his Copy; he knows if he imitates it, his Scribling &s;hall be accepted: However, tho' his Fa|ther may cha&s;ti&s;e him with Rods, if he be carele&s;s to imitate, yet he will never ca&s;t him therefore off from being his Son. The Truth is this, it argues a mo&s;t gracele&s;s, carnal, wretched Heart, for a Man to care by God's Rules, becau&s;e Attendance to them is his Trouble and Torment, which unto a gracious Heart

on him in the very Night,</HI> P&s;al. 63.3, 6.

<P N="2">2. In &s;peaking and commending of him: Is it po&s;|&s;ible that any Man &s;hould love another and not com|mend him, not &s;peak of him?

Can it &s;tand with this Life of Love, to be alway &s;peak|ing about worldly Affairs, or News at the be&s;t; both Week-Day and Sabbath-Day, in Bed and at Board, in good Company and in bad, at Home and Abroad? I tell you it will be one main Rea&s;on why you de&s;ire to live, that you may make the Lord Je&s;us known to your Children, Friends, Acquaintance, that &s;o in the Ages to come his Name might ring, and his Memorial might be of &s;weet Odour, from Generation to Generation, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 71.18.
