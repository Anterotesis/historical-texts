<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I am very glad to meet you here at this Time, and to find that the Sky is clear, and that the Road is open and &s;afe to travel in: I &s;peak this in Behalf of Seven Nations, and all their Cou&s;ins, Captains and Warriors, and thank the Almighty that he has once more brought us all together, to &s;hake Hands.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We &s;uppo&s;e, that during the late Troubles, you may have lo&s;t many of your People, ei|ther by Sickne&s;s or War, &s;ince we were la&s;t together; by this String, therefore, we wipe away the Tears from your Eyes, clear your Throats, wa&s;h away the Blood from your Bodies, &s;weep the Council Chamber, and throw the Dirt out of Doors, that you may &s;ee and &s;peak to us clearly at the pre&s;ent Conference.</P>

<HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We the Seven Nations<NOTE PLACE="marg">1761.</NOTE>, and all our Cou&s;ins, are &s;orry, from the Bottom of our Hearts, for the Death of your Men, Women and Children; and by this Belt we collect all their Bones together, bury them in one Grave, and cover them up.</P>
<P><HI>A black Belt of eight Rows, &s;treaked with White.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We the Seven Nations, and our Cou&s;ins, are at a great Lo&s;s, and &s;it in Darkne&s;s, as well as you, by the Death of <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> as &s;ince his Death we cannot &s;o well under&s;tand one another: By this Belt we cover his Body with Bark.</P>
<P><HI>A white Belt of &s;even Rows, with four black Streaks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>By the la&s;t Belt I mentioned to you that we both &s;at in Darkne&s;s, now by this Belt I re|move the Clouds from before the Sun, that we may &s;ee it ri&s;e and &s;et, and that your Hearts may be ea&s;ed from Sorrow, on Account of what I mentioned before.</P>
<P><HI>A white Belt of five Rows, with three black Bars.</HI></P>
<P>After the Delivery of the Belt, he added (having forgot it before) We pray the Great God above, who can enlighten our Hearts, that we may live in Love and Peace until Death.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Having taken Notice of the Death of <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> and the Darkne&s;s it has occa&s;ioned among&s;t us, I now, by this Belt (taking Hold of the Belt in the Middle) rai&s;e up another Interpreter, by who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance we may under&s;tand one another clearly.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>(Speaking with the other Part of the Belt) You know that in former Times, when great Men grew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and died, we u&s;ed to put others in their Places; now as <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er</HI> (who was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Man, and one Half a Seven Nation <HI>Indian,</HI> and one Half an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>) is dead, we recommend it to the Governor to appoint his Son (pointing to <HI>Samuel Wei&s;er,</HI> then pre&s;ent) to &s;ucceed him as an Interpreter, and to take Care of the Seven Nations and their Cou&s;ins. We take Hold of this Belt, and cla&s;p our Hands together in Friend&s;hip, and de|&s;ire you will not neglect our Reque&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>A black and white Belt of eight Rows.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>When I receive a Letter from you, I cannot under&s;tand it, which I think very hard, and we ought to have &s;ome body living among us, who can under&s;tand and interpret your Me&s;|&s;ages, and the Letters you &s;end to us; wherefore I take my Child, <HI>James Sherlock,</HI> by the Hand, and pre&s;ent him to you, that with your Leave he may live among&s;t us, and &s;erve us as an Interpreter on all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Three Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Having by the la&s;t String recommended <HI>James Sherlock</HI> to you, as an Interpreter, we have no more to &s;ay to you at pre&s;ent, but to inform you that we have &s;ufficiently re&s;ted our&s;elves, after the Fatigue of our Journey, ea&s;ed our Hearts of all Sorrow, and are ready to hear any Thing you have to &s;ay to us.</P>
<P><HI>Three Strings.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor then informed them, that he thanked them for what they had &s;aid, and would return them an An&s;wer at another Time, and in a more convenient Place, of which he would give them timely Notice.</P>

<P>You told us by this Belt, three Years ago, that you removed this, which is but a little Fire, to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where our Ance&s;tors formerly kindled their great Fire, and made all their Alliances and Treaties.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>

<P>I INTEND to take no other Method, than what I have already agreed with the Go|vernor. Brother, now I take the &s;oft Feather to clear your Ears, which our Grandfathers u&s;ed for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, that you may hear di&s;tinctly whatever I may &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Four chequered Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ire you would now hear me; I beg you would frame that good Heart God has given you in a right Way, that you may &s;en&s;ibly feel, and have a right Under&s;tanding, of what I am going to &s;ay to you.</P>
<P><HI>Four chequered Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am come here to this Place, where we met about three Years ago. I then told you, I would take that Medicine which our Maker has ordered for us, to apply to any Wounds we may have. I likewi&s;e told you, that I do not apply it any where but where the Wound is&mdash;I have now come to &s;ee whether the Wound is healed, or no.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You then told me, when you looked on the Road our Grandfathers laid out, that you ob|&s;erved many Bu&s;hes and much Gra&s;s grown there, &s;o that you could not &s;ee me. You then took me by the Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>All my young Men, as far as the Tweteeway Nations, have let me know, that they intend firmly to join in and &s;tand to whatever you and I have agreed on; and al&s;o tho&s;e young Men I have with me, <HI>Mohickons, Opies, and Delawares,</HI> &s;ay they will not take Notice of what few drops of Blood have &s;tained our Road, but will look &s;teady to our Agreement.</P>
<P><HI>A black Belt of &s;even Rows, and five chequered Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve what I am going to &s;ay, and I will let you know we have cleared our&s;elves, as far as <HI>Makahelou&s;ink, Papounan</HI>'s Hou&s;e. I will a&s;&s;ure you, that I want to make a Peace between us as la&s;ting as the World. I call the Almighty to witne&s;s, that I have no Captives in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as far as Makahelou&s;ink.</P>
<P><HI>Seven chequered Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have one Thing more to &s;ay: I would not have you look to me any more for any Thing, for I believe nothing will ever make us differ again, except it is your Fault, for I am &s;ure nothing on my Part &s;hall cau&s;e it; therefore, if any Thing &s;hould fall out, examine your own Hearts, for it mu&s;t &s;pring from you, becau&s;e all our young Men have put it into the Care of their Chiefs to manage Affairs.</P>
<P><HI>Three chequered Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Our Grandfathers u&s;ed to hold great Treaties of Peace and good Friend&s;hip, now we that &s;uc|ceed them will do the &s;ame; they u&s;ed to agree that we &s;hould have one Ear and one Eye, now you &s;it at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and I am away in the Country, and whatever one hears or &s;ees, the other &s;hould hear it and &s;ee it al&s;o, becau&s;e we are Brothers.</P>
<P><HI>Thirteen chequered Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>

<PB N="7" REF="008887_0006_10308F300DD89610">I will not leave it &s;o &s;uddenly; but, if I &s;hould &s;ee any Danger, I will endeavour to jump out of the Way of that Danger.</P>

<P>It is about three Years ago that I de&s;ired my Uncles would give me a Deed for the Lands at <HI>Wyoming,</HI> but as they have not done it, I believe I &s;hall get up and leave it; for you know, according to your Cu&s;tom, you hold all Lands by Deeds, and if our Uncles had given us a Deed, our Children would enjoy them after us: If they had given me a Deed, my Children and Grandchildren would live there as long as the World la&s;ts; but as that is not done, I believe I &s;hall leave it.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this belt we di&s;pel the dark Clouds, which you have ju&s;tly ob&s;erved the Death of our good Friend has occa&s;ioned, and make the Sky perfectly clear again, that we may behold the Light all the Day long: We ea&s;e your Hearts from the Grief you were under, on this mournful Account, and we pray God that we may for ever live together in Peace and Love.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Having thus paid our Regards to our decea&s;ed Friend, we cannot but ob&s;erve, with you, that there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of appointing &s;ome other Per&s;on to &s;ucceed him, by who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance we may be enabled to find the true Sen&s;e and Meaning of what there may be Occa&s;ion to &s;ay to one another, either in Council, or by Letters, or Me&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>In Conformity to the ancient Cu&s;tom of taking from among the Relations of any great Man who dies, &s;ome fit Per&s;on to &s;upply his Place (as Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> was by Adoption one of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> though by birth one of us) we think you did well to ca&s;t your Eyes upon one of his Children, and, ina&s;much as <HI>Samuel Wei&s;er</HI> is the only one among&s;t them who has any Knowledge of the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, and has lived among you, we &s;hall be glad to make Trial of him for the pre&s;ent, and if we find him capable of &s;erving in the Office of an Interpreter, and in the Management of <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs (in both which Capacities his Fa|ther &s;o well acquitted him&s;elf) we &s;hall appoint him to that Service. We look upon this Choice of yours as a Mark of your grateful Affection for <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> who was always your &s;incere Friend; and we join this Belt to yours, as Token of our Concurrence, &s;o far as to make Trial of him.</P>
<P><HI>Their Belt, and another.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have now an&s;wered every Thing that you, of the <HI>Seven United Nations,</HI> &s;aid to me at our la&s;t Meeting. I now addre&s;s my&s;elf to <HI>Jenochryada,</HI> the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Chief, to an&s;wer the Me&s;&s;age he &s;ent to me by <HI>Ashenoch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Jenochryada.</P>
<P>You tell me that <HI>James Sherlock</HI> has for &s;ome Time pa&s;t lived with you. I am glad to hear he has behaved in &s;uch a Manner as to obtain your good Opinion of him, and I hope he will continue to prove him&s;elf worthy of your Confidence: I have no Objection to his living among you, or to your employing him in any Bu&s;ine&s;s you may have to tran&s;act with us, which you think him capable of executing; but as he is a young Man, and quite a Stranger to me. I cannot con&s;ent to employ him as an Interpreter for this Government un|til I have as full an Experience of his Abilities and good Di&s;po&s;ition as you have had. In the mean Time, if I &s;hould have any Occa&s;ion of &s;ending Me&s;&s;ages or Letters to your Nation, I &s;hall commit the Care of them to Me&s;&s;engers of my own; and de&s;ire you will ob&s;erve the &s;ame Method, as the likelie&s;t Means to our right under&s;tanding of one another, and prevent|ing Mi&s;takes, which might otherwi&s;e happen.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> Seven United Nations,</P>
<P>You told me, that three Years ago, at a Treaty held here. I invited you, by this Belt, to come down in great Numbers as you were not then all pre&s;ent, and that, as you all were now here, you returned me this Belt, and were glad to &s;ee as here Face to Face.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>My Coun&s;ellors well remember, that this Belt was given you by the late Governor of this Province, at the la&s;t Treaty, but you &s;eem to have mi&s;taken the End and Purpo&s;e for which it was given: I mu&s;t therefore inform you, that it was given to you as a Peace Belt, by which we then renewed our old Treaties, brightened the Chain of Friend&s;hip, confirmed our former Union, and put fre&s;h Earth to the Roots of the Tree of Peace, that it might bear up again&s;t every Storm, and live and flouri&s;h to the End of Time, whil&s;t the Sun &s;hould &s;hine, and the Rivers run; and we then further de&s;ired you would publi&s;h this good News among your own and all other <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, who were your Friends and Allies, and engage them to join with you in a firm Peace with our great King, and all his People. All this ap|pears by the Minutes of that Treaty, taken down to Writing at that Time; you ought
<PB N="9" REF="008887_0008_10308F370797A250">therefore to pre&s;erve this Belt, as a Blood or Earne&s;t of the Engagements are then made to one another, and keep it &s;afe in your Bo&s;oms, and I now return it year for that Purpo&s;e</P>
<P><HI>The Peace Belt returned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You informed us that this String was &s;ent from Seven Nations of Indians over the Lakes, who have formerly been in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, but have lately entered into your Alliance, de&s;iring they might lay Hold with you, of one End of the Chain of Friend&s;hip, that &s;u&s;i&s;ts between you and the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It gaves me great Plea&s;ure to hear that you have &s;trengthened your Intere&s;t by entering into to an Alliance with the&s;e Seven Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> who have been formerly in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>French.</HI> You and I are one Fle&s;h and Blood, and I &s;hall love and e&s;teem all <HI>Indians</HI> what&s;oever, who are in your Friend&s;hip; I will take this String, and &s;end it to the Kings Commander in Chief, and <HI>Sir William John&s;on,</HI> and let them know the De&s;ire tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> have of entering into Friend&s;hip and Alliance with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and I make to Doubt but they with receive them with open Arms. To confirm my Words, I give you this String.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am very much &s;urprized to hear from you, that the&s;e three Belt were brought to the <HI>On|ondagoe</HI> Council by an <HI>Oneida Indian,</HI> about a Year ago, without any Speeches or Me&s;&s;ages to attend them. I can a&s;&s;ure you, I did not &s;end the&s;e Belts to the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council, and therefore I am at a lo&s;&s; to know the Meaning of them, or from whom they came. I have frequently &s;ent Me&s;&s;ages into the <HI>Indian</HI> Country, to put them in Mind of their Promi&s;e to return to us our Fle&s;h and Blood, who are pri&s;oners among them, and to pre&s;s them to ful|fil that Promi&s;e; and it is po&s;&s;ible, that the Belt &s;ent with the Me&s;&s;engers for that Purpo&s;e may have been forwarded to the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Council by mi&s;take; I therefore now return you the Belt, that you may make further Enquiry of the <HI>Oneidas</HI> about them.</P>
<P><HI>The Belts returned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You acquainted me, by the&s;e three Belts, fir&s;t, that you were coming to &s;ee me, and were got as far as <HI>Wyoming;</HI> by the &s;econd, you de&s;ired me to meet you <HI>at Ea&s;ton;</HI> by the third, you de&s;ired me to &s;top &s;trong Drink, and &s;end you Waggons, Provi&s;ions, and Paint. As I have complied with the&s;e &s;everal Reque&s;t, I now return you the Belts.</P>
<P><HI>The three Belts returned.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;everal other Belts and Strings which you received from us at the la&s;t Treaty, and were returned by you to me the Day before Ye&s;terday, I have accepted, and put into the Council Bag.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Whatever may be the Occa&s;ion of your coming down at this Time, I can truly &s;ay, I am glad to &s;ee my old Friends and Brethren once more, and take them by the Hand, and will make you as welcome and ea&s;y, while you &s;tay among us, as I po&s;&s;ibly can. I have only further to &s;ay to you at pre&s;ent, that as we are now Face to Face, we &s;hould open our Hearts to one another, and let nothing remain upon our Minds; if you, on your Part, have any Thing to offer or communicate to me, that relates to the private Intere&s;t or Concerns of this Province, or that can tend to promote and confirm our Friend&s;hip, and prevent all future Cau&s;es of Jealou&s;y and Di&s;content, I &s;hall be glad to hear it.</P>

<P>Jo&s;eph Pepy <HI>&s;tand up, and &s;peake as follows:</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I AM to &s;peak a few Words to you. We had a great Council Fire at <HI>Albany,</HI> when a Friend&s;hip was fir&s;t made with our Grandfathers; after which, about &s;even Years ago, our Brother General <HI>John&s;on</HI> moved the Council Fire from <HI>Albany</HI> to his own Hou&s;e, where he &s;aid to us. <Q>I am one Half <HI>Indian,</HI> and one Half <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> What I &s;ay to my dear Brethren, the <HI>Seven Nations,</HI> &s;hall be true.</Q>&mdash;The <HI>Seven Nations</HI> were accordingly all a&s;&s;embled to the Place where he had kindled the Fire, at which Time he took up a Toma|hawk, gave it them, and told them, he was going to War again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and de&s;ired
<PB N="10" REF="008887_0009_10308F39E2E5E238">them to join with him, and promi&s;ed them, that after the <HI>French</HI> were all conquered and removed, Trade &s;hould be made open and free to them, and all Kinds of Goods &s;hould be|come more cheap, and that their Furs and Skins &s;hould bear a good Price.&mdash;</P>
<P>La&s;t Year General <HI>John&s;on</HI> appointed his Brethren, the <HI>Seven Nations,</HI> to meet him at <HI>O&s;wego,</HI> upon which they did a&s;&s;emble there; at which Time General <HI>John&s;on</HI> ob&s;erving that their Chiefs and Warriors were not all come, he &s;ent a &s;econd Me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring them all to attend him there, and when they did come he &s;aid,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P><Q>I am very glad to &s;ee you here. I &s;ee many of your Chiefs are dead. I am now going again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and out of the Pri&s;oners that I &s;hall take from them, I will put as many in their Room.</Q>&mdash;Now, Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> as General <HI>John&s;on</HI> has not performed his Promi&s;e to us, we &s;ee Death coming upon us, and the God above knows he has wronged us.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We give no Belt or String upon this Occa&s;ion, and only relate it as Matter of Information to you.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Li&s;ten to what your Brethren of the <HI>Seven Nations</HI> &s;ay, in An&s;wer to what you told us Ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>You de&s;ired us to open our Hearts, that nothing unknown might lay hid there, but that every Thing may come out: We de&s;ire, by this Belt, that you may do the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>A white Belt of eight Rows, with three black Bars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We &s;ee, Brethren, on each Side of us: On the one Side, the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> who does not &s;peak or do right to us; on the other Side, General <HI>John&s;on,</HI> who does the &s;ame. We have often heard you &s;peak, and you always do and &s;peak right and ju&s;tly to us; every Time you &s;peak it does our Hearts good. When we look towards you, General <HI>John&s;on</HI> and the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> we e&s;teem you all as One; how comes it then that you do not all &s;peak alike. We, your Brethren of the <HI>Seven Nations,</HI> are penned up like Hogs. There are Forts all around us, and therefore we are apprehen&s;ive that Death is coming upon us. We want nothing but Friend&s;hip with you, &s;o long as the Sun &s;hall &s;hine, and the Waters run.</P>
<P><HI>A white Belt of nine Rows, and four black Bars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Hearken to what your Brethren, the <HI>Seven Nations,</HI> are going to &s;ay to you. When our Grandfathers fir&s;t made a Friend&s;hip together, God &s;aw it: Now we, and all the Nations, would &s;tand to the Agreement they made, and when any Nations &s;mile upon us, we will join with them. Now, dear Brother, may God Almighty give us Strength and Knowledge, to continue our Friend&s;hip. We look at no other, but to you, to hold fa&s;t the Chain of Friend&s;hip. We are cru&s;hed on all Sides, &s;o that we cannot &s;tir our&s;elves, nor look any Way but to you.&mdash;Now, dear Brother, that we &s;ee you Face to Face, we de&s;ire that you would not &s;lack your Friend&s;hip, but hold it fa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>A black and white Belt of &s;even Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I would only let you know, in a few Words, how our Brother General <HI>John&s;on</HI> &s;erved us.&mdash;When we come to him for Ammunition, and bring our Skins, he does not give us the Worth of our Skins, but only a Handful of Powder; and for that Rea&s;on we think there is certain Death coming upon us.&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;huts up his Powder from us, and will not give us more than will &s;erve us two or three Days. We only mention this to you, but if you will continue to &s;mile on us, we will look to you.</P>
<P><HI>A white Belt of &s;ix Rows, and three black Bars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We are now &s;en&s;ible, that we were under a Mi&s;take with Re&s;pect to the Meaning of this Belt (holding up the large Peace Belt) We &s;hould not have brought it back to you again, if we had known what it meant: We are very glad that you have explained it to us: We look upon it as the Belt of Peace, and will &s;hew it to all the Nations over the Lake, and will lodge it in the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council, where the only General Council Fire is kept, and where it ought to remain.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>This is all your Brethren of the <HI>Seven Nations</HI> have to &s;ay.</P>

<P>YOU will plea&s;e to hear what the <HI>Six Nations</HI> are going to &s;ay to you. Some of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have &s;ettled upon our Lands, but we don't know from whence they came.

<P><HI>A Belt of &s;even Rows, with &s;ix Diamonds and a Bar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We have heard that this Land has been &s;old, but we do not know for certain by whom. The <HI>Six Nations</HI> have not &s;old it, and never intended it as yet. Whoever has &s;old the Land, &s;tole it from us, and only did it to fill their Pockets with Money; but we have heard that two <HI>Tu&s;caroras,</HI> one <HI>Oneida,</HI> and one <HI>Mohawk,</HI> have &s;old it, unknown to the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A String of four Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Hear what we are going to &s;ay to you.&mdash;You know there is a Line made between you and us, and we de&s;ire that none of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would &s;ettle on the other Side of that Line.

<P><HI>A Belt of &s;even Rows, with three black Diamonds.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We are very poorly off, as we have no Trade &s;tirring among us, and as we have men|tioned to you that the Things we buy from General <HI>John&s;on</HI> are very dear, we hope you will have Pity on us, and erect a Trading-hou&s;e at <HI>Diahoga,</HI> that we may be to buy our Goods cheaper. We are in great Want of all Kinds of Goods, but e&s;pecially of Powder and Lead, and hope you will &s;upply us plentifully with them. We de&s;ire you would not al|low any &s;trong Liquor to be &s;ent among us, as we &s;hall fetch that our&s;elves, whenever we &s;hall want it. As &s;oon as we &s;ee your People come with Goods, we will acquaint all our young Men with it, both far and near, and if your Goods are &s;old rea&s;onable, we &s;uppo&s;e that General <HI>John&s;on</HI> will al&s;o &s;ell his Goods cheaper than he now does.&mdash;We de&s;ire that you would &s;end a good and hone&s;t Man to trade with us.</P>

We de&s;ire you, therefore, that whenever you have Me&s;&s;ages to &s;end, you will &s;end them by tru&s;ty Per&s;ons to our Great Council Fire at <HI>Onondagoe,</HI> that we may be able to under&s;tand them rightly; and as we have cho&s;en <HI>Samuel Wei&s;er</HI> for that Purpo&s;e, you can always &s;end your Me&s;&s;ages by him.</P>
<P><HI>A chequered String of four Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You have often made Mention of your Fle&s;h and Blood, who are Pri&s;oners among us. 'Tis true, Brother, there was &s;ome of your Blood among us; there were Ten among the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> but our Brother General <HI>John&s;on</HI> has al&s;o often &s;poke of them to us, and we have delivered them all up to him; there is none among&s;t us at pre&s;ent&mdash;You mu&s;t now look for then among&s;t the <HI>Delawares,</HI> our Cou&s;ins.</P>

<P>I am very &s;orry to hear that you apprehend General <HI>John&s;on</HI> has been unkind to you. I am afraid the Evil Spirit is again endeavouring to blind your Eyes, and mi&s;lead you. You well know that General <HI>John&s;on</HI> has, for a great Number of Years pa&s;t, manife&s;ted his Love and Friend&s;hip for the <HI>Indians,</HI> on many Occa&s;ions, and you have as often given Proofs of your E&s;teem and good Opinion of him. You &s;hould not therefore &s;uffer the Confidence and Tru&s;t you have repo&s;ed in him, to be interrupted by any Jealou&s;ies or Su&s;picions; but you &s;hould open your Hearts to him, and tell him your Minds freely. I am per&s;uaded he is a very worthy Gentleman, and your good Friend, and if you will lay your Grievances before him, I am &s;ure be will do you Ju&s;tice, if you have been injured, and remove all your Un|ea&s;ine&s;s.</P>

I know of no Lands lying within this Province, which have not been purcha&s;ed of you, that have been &s;ettled by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> except a Tract lying on or near the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> about Fifty Miles above the <HI>Blue Moun|tains.</HI> Brethren, I am glad to have this Opportunity of &s;peaking to you on this Head: It is a Matter of great Con&s;equence, and has given me much Concern; li&s;ten attentively, there|fore, to what I &s;hall &s;ay to you about this Matter. &mdash; You know that an Agreement was made, a great While ago, between your Ance&s;tors and your Brother <HI>Onas</HI> (which has been often renewed and confirmed by many of your Chiefs now living) that your Brother <HI>Onas</HI> would never &s;ettle any Lands in this Province, till he had fairly purcha&s;ed them of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who engaged that they would never &s;ell any Lands in this Province to any other Per&s;on than their Brother <HI>Onas.</HI> That you may refre&s;h your Memories, and call to Mind this Agreement. I give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>A great Number of People who lived in <HI>Connecticut</HI> Government, came about a Year ago and &s;ettled near this River, beyond the Line of the Lands purcha&s;ed of you, at a Place called <HI>Cu&s;hietunck</HI> and claimed all the Lands from thence quite up to <HI>Wyoming.</HI> As &s;oon as heard
<PB N="13" REF="008887_0012_10308F40D14A8F38">of it I &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers to them, informing them the&s;e Lands had never been purcha&s;ed of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and de&s;iring them to remove away. They &s;ent me back, for An&s;wer, that they had purcha&s;ed all tho&s;e Lands of you, and under that Pretence had a Right to them, and would hold them. Now, Brethren, as you have told me you will hide nothing from me, I de&s;ire you will tell me truly, whether you have &s;old the&s;e Lands to the&s;e Strangers, who have &s;ettled them, again&s;t my Will and Con&s;ent? &mdash; (To which Que&s;tion the <HI>Six Nations</HI> made An&s;wer, That tho&s;e were the Lands which they mentioned Ye&s;terday to have been &s;old by four &s;traggling <HI>Indians,</HI> without the Knowledge or Con&s;ent of their General Council, and that they under&s;tood <HI>Thomas King,</HI> an <HI>Oneida Indian,</HI> was one of tho&s;e who had &s;old tho&s;e Lands.)</P>
<P>Upon which An&s;wer the Governor &s;aid,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You know all &s;uch private Sales are of no Force. I therefore join this String to the Belt, and de&s;ire you will &s;end for tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> into the Great Council at <HI>Onondagoe,</HI> and reprove them for their Conduct, and cancel their Deeds.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt and a large String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have already, by the Con&s;ent of my Wi&s;e Men, &s;et up two great Stores, or Trading-hou&s;es, to furni&s;h the <HI>Indians</HI> with all Sorts of Goods, at a cheap Rate, one at <HI>Pitt&s;burgh,</HI> and the other at <HI>Shamokin;</HI> at the la&s;t of which Places you may ea&s;ily &s;upply your&s;elves with whatever you want. The Expences, Lo&s;&s;es, and many Difficulties which attend our &s;ending Goods to the&s;e two Places, are &s;o great, that I cannot &s;et up another Store-hou&s;e at &s;o great a Di&s;tance as <HI>Diahoga,</HI> according to your De&s;ire. &mdash; I am &s;orry to refu&s;e you any Thing; but if I &s;hould agree with you, to do more than I can perform, you would have ju&s;t Rea&s;on to charge me with deceiving you. You mu&s;t not therefore take it ami&s;s, that I always &s;peak plainly to you, and tell you my Mind.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I told you before, that if I &s;hould have Occa&s;ion to &s;end you any Me&s;&s;ages, I would com|mit the care of them to Me&s;&s;engers of my own; and as <HI>Samuel Wei&s;er</HI> is a Per&s;on recom|mended by you for that Purpo&s;e, I will u&s;e him for the future.</P>

<P>I am plea&s;ed to hear you &s;ent to General <HI>John&s;on</HI> our Fle&s;h and Blood, who were Pri&s;oners among the <HI>Cayugas.</HI> We e&s;teem it as the &s;tronge&s;t Proof of your Friend&s;hip that you can po&s;&s;ibly give us. &mdash; You all agreed, at the Treaty held here three Years ago, that you would &s;earch all the Towns and Places in the <HI>Indian</HI> Countries for them, and deliver them up to us, without leaving one behind; and that if they had gone down your Throats, you would heave them up again. I am &s;orry that but very few have yet been brought back, though I know there are a great many &s;cattered up and down among the <HI>Indians.</HI> We cannot help thinking that you &s;peak only from your Lips, and not from your Hearts, whatever Profe&s;&s;ions of Regard you make for us, till this Promi&s;e is performed, and we &s;ee our Fathers, Mothers and Children, who have been carried into Captivity, re&s;tored to us, this Promi&s;e was the Condition on which the Peace Belt was exchanged between us. &mdash; Some among you have been faithful, and &s;ent back all the Pri&s;oners they had; I do not therefore addre&s;s this Part of my Speech to them, but take them to my Heart; it is intended only for &s;uch of the <HI>In|dians</HI> as have deceived us, and &s;till detain our Fle&s;h and Blood. I &s;incerely wi&s;h to be Friends with you all, and therefore once more put you in Mind of your Engagements, and in&s;ist on your immediately complying with them, by re&s;toring the Pri&s;oners, that nothing may remain to make any Difference between us to the End of Time.</P>

<P>I readily acknowledge that you have been a great In&s;trument in bringing about the great Work of Peace; and, according to the Promi&s;es you made us at this Place three Years ago, the Peace Belt has been &s;ent to &s;everal Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> who have &s;ince joined their Hands to it; &s;o that, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Mo&s;t High, the Wound, by the Means of the Medi|cine you have applied, is intirely healed.

<P>PRESENT, <HI>as before.</HI></P>
<P>IN Con&s;equence of the Governor's pre&s;&s;ing Demand for the <HI>Indians</HI> to deliver up all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners they had now with them, they produced one Girl, and delivered her up to the Governor in Form.</P>
<P>The Governor then &s;poke to the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am now to inform you, that &s;ince our la&s;t Meeting at this Place, three Years ago, the Road has been &s;tained with a few Drops of Blood. The fir&s;t Thing of this Kind happened over <HI>Su&s;quehanna,</HI> where one <HI>Indian</HI> Man, his Wife, and two Children were found dead, having been either murdered or drowned in the River <HI>Conedogwainet.</HI> It no &s;ooner came to my Knowledge, but I i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation, offering <HI>Two Hundred and Sixty-&s;ix Dollars,</HI> as a Reward for detecting and apprehending all &s;uch as &s;hould be concerned in this Murder: but, notwith&s;tanding all my Endeavours, nothing certain has yet been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>About two Months ago, our very <HI>good</HI> Friend <HI>Thomas Hickman</HI> was found &s;hot in the <HI>Tu&s;carora Path Valley.</HI> One Per&s;on is now in Goal, on Su&s;picion; two others were put into Pri&s;on, but &s;et at Liberty again, at the In&s;tance of the <HI>Indians,</HI> it appearing to them that they were innocent. All po&s;&s;ible Endeavours are now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to find out who did this wicked Act; a Reward has been offered, by publick Proclamation, for their Apprehen&s;ion, and I hope we &s;hall find them.</P>
<P>There may have been &s;ome few more of &s;uch In&s;tances, which I may not have been par|ticularly informed of; but the&s;e are all that have reached my Ears.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are Accidents, which ought not to affect the Peace made between us; It is as grie|vous to me as to you to hear of the&s;e wicked Acts, and let them be who they will that have been guilty of the&s;e Murders, they &s;hall die them&s;elves, as &s;oon as convicted thereof, by a lawful Tryal. With this Belt I collect their Bones, and put them all into one Grave.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>I fill up their Graves, and cover their Bodies with the&s;e Strouds.</P>
<P><HI>Strouds.</HI></P>
<P>With the&s;e Handkerchiefs I wa&s;h off the Blood from your Bodies, and wipe away the Tears from your Eyes.</P>
<P><HI>Handkerchiefs.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<P>I beg you will hearken to what I am going to &s;ay. You may remember, &s;ome Years ago, at our Council Fire, you took me by the Hairs of my Head, and &s;hook me, and told me to go and live at <HI>Wyoming,</HI> for you gave me the Land there, where I might rai&s;e my Bread, and get my Living; now again you de&s;ire me to move off from thence, and would place me &s;omewhere el&s;e.

<P>You de&s;ire me to make Satisfaction to your Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI> for the&s;e Lands which they claim, as they often think of it; had you known, as well as I do, how groundle&s;s and unju&s;t this Claim of theirs was, I am &s;ure you would not have taken any Notice of it. Your old Men mu&s;t remember, that at a full Council held with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in the Year 1742, the Claim the <HI>Delawares</HI> now make for the&s;e very Lands was laid before them, and the Deeds from them to the Proprietaries peru&s;ed and con&s;idered by the <HI>Six Na|tions;</HI> who, upon a full Hearing of the Matter, then were convinced that the Proprietaries had fairly purcha&s;ed them of the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and paid for them. Whereupon the <HI>Six Nations</HI> ordered the <HI>Delawares</HI> to remove off from them, and go to <HI>Wyoming,</HI> which they accordingly did. <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> &s;ome Time ago, referred his Complaint about the&s;e Lands to our Great King, who has ordered General <HI>John&s;on</HI> to enquire into the whole Matter, and let him know how it is circum&s;tanced, that Ju&s;tice may be done as well to the <HI>Delawares</HI> as to us; and I am ready to &s;end my Commi&s;&s;ioners to General <HI>John&s;on,</HI> to lay before him the Proprietaries Deeds for, and Right to, the&s;e Lands, whenever <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> will appoint a Time and Place for this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Tokahaio</HI> addre&s;&s;ed the Governor, in Behalf of the <HI>Tuteloes,</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We de&s;ire our Brother will be &s;o good as to furni&s;h us with three Waggons, to carry home our Sick, who are not able to walk, as we intend to go home as &s;oon as we can; &mdash; which Reque&s;t the Governor granted, and left the Number of Waggons to be provided for them, to the Direction of <HI>Jo&s;eph Fox,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></P>
<P>Tokahaio <HI>then added,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We have been here at this Council Fire, and heard what good Word you have &s;poke to We have no more to &s;ay at pre&s;ent, and we &s;ee likewi&s;e that you have nothing more to
<PB N="18" REF="008887_0017_10308F4FCCC8ACB0">&s;ay to us; we are therefore going to part. When we return home, we will acquaint all our People with what we have heard. We heartily thank you for the good U&s;age we have re|ceived from you.</P>
<P>The Governor informed them that he had brought up with him a Pre&s;ent from the Go|vernment to them, which Mr. Fox would di&s;tribute among&s;t them To-morrow; and then concluded the Treaty, by &s;haking Hands with the Chiefs of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Governor and his Company &s;et out for <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
