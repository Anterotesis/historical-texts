<HEAD>A VINDICATION OF THE <HI>Appendix</HI> to the <HI>Sober Remarks.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot ea&s;ily imagine what a grateful En|tertainment I always have, when any Lines come to me from <HI>your</HI> obliging Hand. I am particularly bound to thank you for your <HI>la&s;t</HI> very acceptable Letter; which was the more welcome, for the kind <HI>Pre&s;ents</HI> that accompany'd it. The <HI>Defence of the Mode&s;t Proof,</HI> which you &s;ent me, appears in <HI>my</HI> Eyes, as you &s;ay it does in yours, A Peece of &s;o &s;ingular a Complexion and Make (&s;urely perfect in its kind) that I know not how to model my Countenance when I read it, whether for Laughter, for Indignation, or Com|pa&s;&s;ion. An extraordinary BOOK it is, as well for the Stile and Method, as for the peculiar Vein of Argument running through the Body of the Work; and mu&s;t needs therefore make a very admirable Appearance on the Stage of Literature. Undoubtedly the <HI>Author</HI> is &s;ome mighty Chief; &s;ome great Ma&s;ter at the Art of Wrangling, and us'd to throw the Ball of Contention; a Man fit to be the <HI>Champion</HI> of &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd a Party, and doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Hand they could pick out to under|take

the Re&s;cue of their <HI>baffl'd Cau&s;e.</HI> Pity indeed but that &s;uch rare Talents &s;hould be di&s;play'd, and not lie ru&s;ting in a Corner. Tho' equally a Pity 'tis, they had not been employ'd on a more worthy and defen&s;ible Sub|ject. For I doubt he will &s;hrink in his Figure, and come off with Shame: Since we often &s;ee the greate&s;t <HI>Wits</HI> mi&s;carry in a bold Di&s;pute for want of a good Cau&s;e, as well as others of le&s;s Skill, for want of a good Con|duct. However it &s;eems He was re&s;olv'd for once to venture, and comes into the Field with an unequal'd Zeal and Courage; perhaps <HI>tru&s;ting in his Armour</HI> more than in his Cau&s;e. He bravely enters the Lifts with <HI>&s;everal</HI> Adver&s;aries together: And upon a view of them, taking 'em to be little impotent Animals, capable only to <HI>bi&s;s</HI> and <HI>&s;pit their Venom,</HI> he de&s;pi&s;es and derides them, as <HI>Goliah</HI> (the famous Phili&s;tine of <HI>Gath,</HI> that proud Giant, who de&s;y'd the Armies of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>) di&s;dain'd his Antagoni&s;t, <HI>David,</HI> as a puny STRIPLING; by no meant an equal Match for &s;uch a valiant, experienc'd Warrior as He. This Hero <HI>finds a &s;trong Reluctance in encountring</HI> them; and &s;corns to be in Earne&s;t, to put out his Strength, or &s;hew his Skill: but only makes a few in&s;ignificant Flou|ri&s;hes, and harmle&s;s unde&s;igning Pa&s;&s;es. He appears con|tinually, like a Man in <HI>Je&s;t,</HI> only to &s;port and play with them as <HI>Children:</HI> thinking perhaps, that it would be too a great an <HI>Honour</HI> put upon <HI>Them,</HI> and too much an <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> of his <HI>own</HI> Intellectual Powers and Learning, to go to rea|&s;on and debate with Them in Earne&s;t.&mdash; Or el&s;e He &s;us|pected, that a <HI>Rational</HI> Defen&s;e of the <HI>Mod. Proof</HI> and <HI>the Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> might po&s;&s;ibly prove a <HI>laborious Ta&s;k,</HI> that wou'd co&s;t him a great Deal of Time, and be too long a Diver&s;ion from his better Employments. There|fore he generally contents him&s;elf with peremptory A&s;&s;er|tions, warm Harangues, and witty De&s;cants: &s;umming up all (O the happine&s;s he mu&s;t needs feel&punc;) in glorious and triumphant Conclu&s;ions; tho' (alas) &s;upported by little other Evidence, than the A&s;&s;urance wherewith he lays them down.</P>
<P>INDEED, in that part of his Performance, which con|cerns <HI>me</HI> more particularly, and which the following
<PB N="3" REF="002636_0005_0FE5D771E5D9C9F0">
Sheets are pointed again&s;t, (I mean the <HI>&s;ix la&s;t</HI> pages of his <HI>Appendix</HI>) He here <HI>varies</HI> his Mine and Shape very wonderfully; puts on &s;ome Features both of the <HI>Gentleman</HI> &amp; the <HI>Scholar;</HI> and not only regales me with unu&s;ual Airs of Civility, but al&s;o makes &s;ome Efforts to &s;tate &amp; argue matters like a <HI>Di&s;putant.</HI> For when a Man's Pa&s;&s;ion, or his Humour of Je&s;ting, has talkt it &s;elf out of breath, many times his Rea&s;on re|covers, and takes its turn to &s;peak.&mdash; Now therefore, to retaliate his Kindne&s;s, I &s;hall &s;tudy, thro' the whole of my Reply to him, to pre&s;erve a due <HI>Temper;</HI> and &s;hall do him the Ju&s;tice to repre&s;ent his Arguments fairly, allow 'em their utmo&s;t Force, and give 'em a &s;ober Con&s;ideration, a di&s;tinct Examination, and more large and particular than is really needful: becau&s;e I'm willing to &s;pare no pains in &s;earching out the Truth in this di&s;puted Subject; and that (if po&s;&s;ible) I may help ca&s;t &s;uch a Light on the Controver&s;y, as to &s;atisfy im|partial Inquirers. Therefore I &s;hall make u&s;e of the <HI>Hints</HI> in my Antagoni&s;t, as occa&s;ions to &s;peak <HI>largely</HI> to things. Indeed, were the Di&s;pute between us al|ready drawn out to any con&s;iderable Length, I &s;hou'd pa&s;s over his brief <HI>Animadver&s;ions</HI> with general &amp; &s;hort Glances. For I &s;uppo&s;e all that is nece&s;&s;ary in a way of <HI>Reply</HI> to <HI>Them,</HI> might be compris'd in a very few Pages; as few, I pre&s;ume, as tho&s;e he has be&s;tow'd on me. 'Tis but a &s;mall part of the <HI>Appendix,</HI> that's affect|ed by what he has advanc'd again&s;t it; and what he has offer'd, &s;eems to have &s;o little Strength in it, that &s;ome have thought a labour'd An&s;wer would be too great a Complement to him. However, for the Rea&s;ons hinted, I &s;hall <HI>take occa&s;ion</HI> from his Animadver&s;ions, to handle the Points, that may fall in my way, &s;omewhat <HI>largely.</HI> This mu&s;t be remembred, or el&s;e I fear you'l cen&s;ure me in many places, as laboriou&s;ly &amp; vainly &s;kirmi&s;hing with a Shadow. Which being premis'd, let me now without any further Ceremony or Apology come to the Remarks I have to offer.</P>
<P>I can ea&s;ily forgive him the Blunder he begins with, in &s;aying, <HI>The Author often varies Shapes &amp; Cha|racters,
<PB N="4" REF="002636_0006_0FE5D77387299E40">
for now he per&s;onates an Independent, and anon a Ruling Elder:</HI> &mdash; as if there were no Ruling Elders among the Independents.</P>
<P>I will al&s;o pa&s;s over his next Reflection, which carries in it a Random-Shot at the <HI>Sectaries,</HI> who (he &s;ays) <HI>do all militate under the &s;ame common Standard of Schi&s;m and Rebellion:</HI> &mdash; for I am no more concern'd in this Ob&s;ervation than him&s;elf. Di&s;mi&s;&s;ing it then as wholly foreign; I come to his three <HI>Preliminaries,</HI> which are de&s;ign'd to <HI>give a ju&s;t Turn of Thought to tho&s;e that have been under an unhappy Bia&s;s in the Controver&s;y.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. AND here I concur with him, in the Sub&s;tance of his <HI>first</HI> Preliminary, touching <HI>the Nature of the Apo&s;|tolical Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> where he ob&s;erves, <HI>That it is on all hands agreed to be the Grand Charter for the Evangeli|cal Mini&s;try;</HI> That <HI>it contains more in its Nature than is expre&s;&s;ed;</HI> and that <HI>the Intent and Purport of it must be gathered from the Practice of the Apo&s;tles, as they under&s;tood and explained it in their acting by and upon it.</HI> Here, I confe&s;s, is <HI>a ju&s;t Turn of Thought,</HI> but &s;uch a one as gives an unhappy Blow to his own Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>OBSERVE, He allows the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> to be the <HI>grand Charter</HI> for the <HI>Evangelical Mini&s;try.</HI> By which, if I under&s;tand him right, he means, That this is the <HI>Diploma Regium,</HI> the Royal Warrant, Licen&s;e, or Patent, by which every true Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter claims, or is authoriz'd and impower'd. I &s;uppo&s;e He will con&s;ent to the Words of his Friend (and perhaps Countryman) <HI>Barclay,</HI> who thus expre&s;&s;eth his Sen&s;e of the Matter, (in his <HI>Per&s;ua&s;ive,</HI> pag. 91.) <HI>It is by virtue of the Commi&s;&s;ion given to the</HI> Apo&s;tles <HI>by our Saviour, that any Man is an authorized Mini&s;ter: And if it is not by virtue of this Commi&s;&s;ion, that</HI> ALL <HI>Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters are autho|riz'd, I de&s;ire any one to &s;hew what Authority they have and where it is founded.</HI> &mdash; Here is a good Comment on that Conce&s;&s;ion of my Animadverter. But perhaps it may be better to compare it with another Pa&s;&s;age of his own el&s;ewhere, which &s;ufficiently explains his Sen&s;e.
<PB N="5" REF="002636_0007_0FE5D735866271F8">
It is in his <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">N.B. I call it <HI>His,</HI> (and &s;hall go upon this Pre&s;umption in &s;ome further Ob&s;ervations afterwards) becau&s;e of the near <HI>Affinity</HI> betwixt the &s;train of <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> in the <HI>Def.</HI> and in the <HI>Animadv,</HI> and becau&s;e there are &s;ome very <HI>peculiar</HI> Turns of <HI>Language</HI> common to them both, &amp;c. which &s;peaks them to be hammer'd on the &s;ame Anvil.</NOTE> <HI>Defence</HI> of <HI>Mod. Proof,</HI> (pag. 61.) where &s;peaking of the Apo&s;tolical Commi&s;&s;ion, he affirms, <HI>That there are &s;everal Things contained in it, and &s;everal Offices warranted by it, as the Powers of Preaching, ad|ministring the Sacraments, Ordination, and Government by proper Officers, and that</HI> ALL <HI>that di&s;charge</HI> ANY <HI>of tho&s;e Functions, act by virtue of</HI> THIS <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI> &mdash; Now I do a&s;&s;ert, He has by the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions given a fatal wound to the Cau&s;e of Prelacy; and mu&s;t think &s;o, till he &s;hall refute my Remarks on the like Expre&s;&s;ions of Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI>'s, (See the <HI>Appendix,</HI> pag. 31,&mdash; 38.) where I have &s;hewn, That hereby he hath di&s;arm'd him&s;elf of his Herculean Argument, from the <HI>Seventy,</HI> and has put it intirely out of his power, by any other Medium what|&s;oever, to prove the Divine Right of Prelacy. I de&s;ire my Animadverter wou'd con&s;ult the Pages cited, and let us have his Animadver&s;ions upon them, as he wou'd do Ju&s;tice to his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I agree with him, in the Remainder of his fir&s;t Prelimi|nary, viz. <HI>That the Apo&s;tles Commi&s;&s;ion contains more in its nature than is expre&s;&s;ed, and that the Purport of it mu&s;t be gather'd from their Practice upon it</HI> &mdash;. But then we mu&s;t carefully ob&s;erve the allow'd Di&s;tinction between their <HI>ordinary</HI> and their <HI>extraordinary</HI> Powers and actions. It is acreed on all &s;ides, That the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> had &s;ome <HI>peculiar</HI> Powers, that were <HI>extraordinary,</HI> and <HI>temporary,</HI> and expir'd with their Per&s;ons: by virtue whereof they did this &amp; t'other extraordinary <HI>Action,</HI> that can't be drawn into a Pre&s;ident for After-Ages, which af|ford only &s;uch Officers, as &s;ucceed them in their <HI>ordinary Powers.</HI>&mdash; Under this head, the Author of <HI>Mod. Proof</HI> (pag, 33.) enumerates their <HI>Jurisdiction over all Churches and Pa&s;tors, their backing their Cen&s;ures with
<PB N="6" REF="002636_0008_0FE5D7CE46E409C0">
Corporal Puni&s;hments, and perhaps their in&s;tituting new Go&s;pel Officer, &amp;c.</HI> The&s;e Things we find in Fact they did: but that they did them <HI>by virtue</HI> of their Commi&s;&s;ion (in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28) <HI>as acting</HI> immediately <HI>by and upon it,</HI> I &s;carce believe my Animadverter will a&s;&s;ert; becau&s;e it is plain they were extraordinary Actions, and cou'd be done only by virtue of their extraordinary Powers. Whereas that <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> contains nothing beyond the <HI>ordinary</HI> Du|ties and Powers, not peculiar to the Apo&s;tles, but common to all their Brethren and Succe&s;&s;ors in the Mini&s;try. A|greeably Bi&s;hop <HI>Hall,</HI> &s;peaking of the Promi&s;e annexed, ob&s;erves, <Q>Chri&s;t was with them, not in the Infalli|blene&s;s of their Judgment, nor in the Univer&s;ality of their Charge; but in the effectual Execution of tho&s;e Offices, which &s;hould be perpetuated to His Church for the Salvation of Mankind. Such were the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, and the Admini&s;tration of the Sacraments, the Ordaining Church-Officers, the ordering of Church affairs, the Infliction of Cen&s;ures and the Power of the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</Q>&mdash; As to any In&s;pection and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fluence over the <HI>Presbyters</HI> and con&s;tituted <HI>Churches,</HI> that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> might have, and if they be &s;uppo&s;ed to exerci&s;e a <HI>Juris|diction</HI> over them, this mu&s;t be founded in the <HI>extraordi|nary Powers,</HI> which were peculiar to them&s;elves, and tempo|rary; as I have argu'd el&s;ewhere (<HI>Append.</HI> to Sob. Rem. p. 26, 27.) unto which I can't find the <HI>Animadverter</HI> has &s;aid any thing, to take off the force of my Rea&s;oning there: I &s;hall think it &s;tands good then, till I hear fur|ther from him; and upon a review, perhaps it may ap|pear to him not unworthy of &s;ome &s;erious Reflections.</P>
<P>AND now I &s;hall hint three or four things to &s;et the <HI>Nature of this Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> in a true Light, from the <HI>Practice of the Apo&s;tles by and upon it;</HI> which I doubt not will make the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Hypothe&s;is as clear as plain Fact can make a thing.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, we may ob&s;erve, While the Apo&s;tles remain'd at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> after Chri&s;t's A&s;cen&s;ion, (which <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> reports, was for <HI>&s;everal Years</HI>) they acted in a complete <HI>Parity:</HI> and even <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> (who &s;eemed to be <HI>Pillars,</HI> as much as <HI>James,</HI> pretended to be

Bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem) were <HI>&s;ent out</HI> by their Brethren, upon a particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rrand to <HI>Samaria.</HI> (<HI>Act.</HI> 8 14) And afterwards we find this Equality continu'd among the Bi&s;hops and Pa&s;tors in the Church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> Hence it is &s;aid, <HI>Act.</HI> 11.22. THEY <HI>&s;ent forth Barnabas.</HI> The Act pa&s;&s;eth not in the name of a Prelate, nor of the A|po&s;tles. So in <HI>Act.</HI> 15. we read of a matter of Contro|ver&s;y refer'd to the Deci&s;ion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Apo&s;tles &amp; Elders</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and it is &s;aid. <HI>The</HI> Apo&s;tles and Elders <HI>came together to con&s;ider of this matter: and there</HI> was <HI>much Di&s;puting:</HI> and when they were come to a Determination, the Re&s;ult pa&s;&s;ed in the Names of them all without Di&s;tinction. [The <HI>Decrees</HI> are &s;aid to be <HI>ordained of the Apo&s;tles &amp; Elders.]</HI> Then they <HI>all agreed</HI> to &s;end cho&s;en Men or their own Company, with <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> to carry their Letters to <HI>Anticch.</HI> So that in all the managements in the Church at <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI> hitherto, there appears not the lea&s;t &s;ign or &s;hadow of a Prelacy. And doubtle&s;s all other Churches were form'd after the &s;ame Model with that.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, ob&s;erve, when the Apo&s;tles planted a Church in any Place, they &s;ettled a <HI>Plurality</HI> of Pres|byters in it. Thus we read, <HI>Act.</HI> 14.23. <HI>Paul &amp; Barna|bas ordained them Elders in every Church.</HI> A number of Elders; and no mention of a Bi&s;hop <HI>&s;et over</HI> them.</P>
<P>THESE Elders were them&s;elves <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and <HI>Church-Rulers.</HI> My <HI>Animadverter</HI> him&s;elf &s;hall be my Voucher for this; who tells us, that the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> which the <HI>A|po&s;tles &s;ettled in the Churches,</HI> and particularly <HI>tho&s;e at Corinth, had the Powers both of Sacraments &amp; Cen|&s;ures:</HI> and for proof he alledges 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.5, 7, 12, 13. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2 6. If we con&s;ult the&s;e places, we &s;hall find the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks to the Corinthian Elders as <HI>Church-Rulers,</HI> ve&s;ted with the Power of the Keys. We &s;hall find they pa&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Church-Cen&s;ure on the In|ce&s;tuous Per&s;on; and then ab&s;olv'd him again upon his Repentance. So that they exercis'd the power of the Keys both in <HI>Binding</HI> and in <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ing.</HI> My Animadver|ter therefore well a&s;cribes unto them <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments &amp; Cen&s;ures.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002636_0010_0FE5D77E5C6BDD18">AND indeed this is but agreeable to the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as it may be gather'd out of the <HI>Public Offices;</HI> where we find <HI>Presbyters</HI> receiving a pretty advanc'd Character, as <HI>Rulers</HI> and Pa&s;tors. Thus, They &s;eem to have Authority over the <HI>Deacons,</HI> as ap|pears by the <HI>Deacons</HI> Ordination-Vow, wherein They promi&s;e <HI>Reverently to obey Their Ordinary</HI> [the Bi&s;hop's Suffragan, who is at be&s;t but a Presbyter] <HI>and other chief Mini&s;ters of the Church</HI> [Presbyters &s;till] AND <HI>Them to whom the Charge &amp; Government over them is com|mitted:</HI> By whom, I &s;uppo&s;e, was originally intended the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> of the re&s;pective Congregations, to which tho&s;e Deacons were imploy'd to mini&s;ter.

So that (as I hinted in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> pag. 24.) it &s;hould &s;eem that the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;uppo&s;es her <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> to be equally ve&s;ted with the Power of <HI>Di&s;cipline, according to the Word of GOD;</HI> and what <HI>Difference</HI> there is in the Exerci&s;e of it, mu&s;t be grounded on <HI>Human</HI> Con&s;titutions.

their Hands. He that denies this, mu&s;t certainly have a very odd Turn of Thought; and my Animadverter mu&s;t needs be <HI>under an unhappy Bia&s;s</HI> (indeed) <HI>in the Con|trover&s;y,</HI> if he denies Presbyters the power of <HI>Ordination,</HI> after he has thus a&s;&s;erted their governing Power, and proclaim'd them Parochial Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps he may <HI>object:</HI> This Arguing is vain; for there mu&s;t this nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;tinction be ob&s;erv'd, <HI>That the Government,</HI> with which <HI>Ordination</HI> is connected, <HI>is not that of meer</HI> Presbyters <HI>over their &s;ingle Flocks, but that of</HI> Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops <HI>over a Plurality of Churches and their Pa&s;tors. The Government of</HI> Prelates, <HI>and that of</HI> Presbyters, <HI>are two different &s;orts of Govern|ment; and the Government which the Power of</HI> Ordina|tion <HI>was annexed to, is that of</HI> Prelates <HI>taken in its proper pre&s;ent Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Sen&s;e, and not that that meer</HI> Pres|byters <HI>have over their &s;ingle Congregations.</HI> So he di&s;|tingui&s;hes in his <HI>Def. of Mod. Proof,</HI> p. 21.</P>
<P>TO which I an&s;wer, That this Di&s;tinction appears to be <HI>without any ju&s;t Foundation.</HI> For there are not two &s;uch different Species of Church-Governours, as he &s;peaks of. Either <HI>Presbyters</HI> have the <HI>complete</HI> Power of Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Rule, or they have <HI>none</HI> at all. The latter is contrary to the declared Sen&s;e of my Animadverter: He expre&s;ly allows them a <HI>Government over their Flocks,</HI> even <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments and Cen&s;ures;</HI> which implies, I think, no &s;mall Degree of Authority ve&s;ted in them: But how fatal to his Argument, is this Acknow|legement! He here la&s;hes his own Error; and turns Traitor to his own Cau&s;e.&mdash; For I ask the Gentleman, how he &s;uppo&s;es the <HI>Presbyters</HI> came by &s;o much ruling Power? What <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> is it founded in? For, if it doth not re&s;ult from &s;ome Divine Commi&s;&s;ion, that they are inve&s;ted with, <HI>it is a very criminal Pre&s;umption and an un&s;ufferable In&s;olence in Them</HI> to lay claim to it: <HI>a daring Offence</HI> it mu&s;t needs be, equal at lea&s;t to what They are guilty of, who <HI>approach before God's Altar without the appointed Rites of Con&s;ecration.</HI> I ask then, What Commi&s;&s;ion it is founded in? Is it the
<PB N="11" REF="002636_0013_0FE5D73793072B88">
Commi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Seventy?</HI> No &s;urely; for that doth not contain <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments and Cen&s;ures.</HI> Where then &s;hall we look to find the original of this their governing Power? Shall we repair to <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. and refer it to the <HI>Apo&s;tolical</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion? <HI>Yes;</HI> for if it be not imply'd <HI>there,</HI> it is no where in the Bible. And be&s;ides the Gentleman him&s;elf, (in his <HI>Def. of Mod. Proof,</HI> p. 61.) vouches this for their Warrant, and expre&s;ly affirms, <HI>That it is</HI> by vertue <HI>of this Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> that Pres|byters <HI>di&s;charge the Function of Preaching and Admi|nistring the Sacraments, and exerci&s;e the Powers of Ab&s;olution and Cen&s;ures.</HI> Well but if that Com|mi&s;&s;ion belongs to them, which is the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> in the Church, how can there be any &s;uppos'd of a <HI>&s;uperior</HI> Order to Them? And how come the <HI>Presbyters</HI> to have any Title or Relation at all to <HI>that</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ion; which was given immediately to the twelve <HI>Apostles,</HI> and <HI>not</HI> to the <HI>Seventy Di&s;ciples?</HI> Why truly here is the Difficulty, and the <HI>Self-repugnance,</HI> in our Animadverter's Scheme. For it is a Paradox to me, That <HI>Presbyters</HI> &s;hould have a <HI>governing Power</HI> in the Church, by <HI>vertue</HI> of the Commi&s;&s;ion given to the <HI>Apo&s;tles;</HI> and yet really be no more than Succe&s;&s;ors to the <HI>Seventy Di&s;|ciples,</HI> who&s;e Commi&s;&s;ion contain'd <HI>nothing</HI> of &s;uch an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority. I wonder by what new Logick the Gentleman will be able to accommodate the&s;e two jarring Principles of his. He has ca&s;t his Cau&s;e upon a palpable Contradiction; and while he e&s;&s;ays to gore us with <HI>both Horns</HI> at once, we may hope to e&s;cape without Harm from either.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, As to the&s;e governing Presbyters it may be ob&s;erved, we find none of them claiming a <HI>Su|periority over their Brethren;</HI> nay, the very <HI>Apostles</HI> them&s;elves made no preten&s;ions to any <HI>Supremacy,</HI> or Prelatical Power over them, as Officers of another and higher Order. We do not find that the Apo&s;tles claim'd a <HI>Negative</HI> upon the ordinary Pa&s;tors, and the Churches, in matters of Government, nor &s;o much as a Right of Precedency, as &s;uperior Officers. They own'd <HI>Presbyters</HI> (as in the forementioned ca&s;e of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Elders)
<PB N="12" REF="002636_0014_0FE5D7831FC8F298">
to have the <HI>Power of the Keys,</HI> and &s;eem to know no|thing of their being limited to exerci&s;e them by <HI>Apo&s;to|lical</HI> Direction and Con&s;ent. &mdash; And in the ca&s;e of <HI>Mi&s;&s;ions,</HI> the Apo&s;tles u&s;ed no coercive Power over the Presbyters, but took their <HI>free Con&s;ent;</HI> without which they went not. Thus the Apo&s;tle Paul told the <HI>Corin|thians</HI> (1 Epi&s;. 16.12) <HI>As touching our Brother</HI> Apollos, <HI>I greatly de&s;ired him to come unto you with the Bre|thren, but his Will was not at all to come at this Time; but he will come, when he &s;hall have convenient Time.</HI> Now, according to the Author of <HI>Mod. Proof,</HI> (pag. 30.) <HI>Apollos</HI> was but a <HI>Presbyter;</HI> and yet you &s;ee he acted his own Inclinations, in oppo&s;ition to Apo&s;tolical Intrea|ties: which betokens but little Sen&s;e of any Subjection to the Apo&s;tle, as his Superior and Ruler.</P>
<P>BUT, in a word; what&s;oever <HI>clear Indication</HI> may be pretended <HI>of a Di&s;tinction &amp; Subordination between the Presbyters and the Apo&s;tles,</HI> the &s;ame is equally clear with re&s;pect to &s;ome others that are &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Prelates;</HI> who appear to be as much in Subjection to the Apo&s;tles, as the Presbyters. For In&s;tance, <HI>Timothy</HI> is &s;aid to <HI>minister</HI> unto <HI>Paul,</HI> to be <HI>&s;ent</HI> by him hither and thither, to receive <HI>Commandment</HI> from him <HI>&amp;c:</HI> Which carries as plain Signatures of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Juri&s;diction over this &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Prelate,</HI> as are any where to be &s;een of his Juri&s;diction over Presbyters. Now, (&s;uppo&s;ing that to be in fact a proper Exerci&s;e of <HI>Authority</HI>) I put it to my Animadverter, &mdash; Whether he looks on the Apo&s;tle as therein acting by an <HI>ordinary</HI> Power, or by an <HI>extra|ordinary?</HI> Or, in other words, Whether or no He looks on this <HI>Apo&s;tolic Practice</HI> as giving us any <HI>Explanation</HI> of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion?</HI> And take it which way he will, I ask how he can reconcile it with <HI>his</HI> Scheme of Things. For, if he &s;uppo&s;es the Apo&s;tle to act herein by and up|on his Apo&s;tolical Commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;o explaining it, and leaving a Precedent; then it &s;eems (according to the Animadverter's way of arguing) we mu&s;t not only have Prelates in the Church, but al&s;o <HI>another</HI> order <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to Them: and thus there will be more than <HI>three</HI> orders; which is contrary to his own Scheme. &mdash; But if he de|termines
<PB N="13" REF="002636_0015_0FE5D7872DD84078">
the Apo&s;tle's Practice, in regard of his Juri&s;|diction over <HI>Timothy, not</HI> to be an Explanation of the Apo&s;tolic Commi&s;&s;ion, then &s;ay I, no more is the Juri&s;|diction, that the Apo&s;tles are &s;uppo&s;ed to have exerci&s;ed over <HI>Pre&s;byters.</HI> For (to borrow here a &s;hort Parenthe&s;is from the <HI>Remarker</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sob.

<P>SO then, upon the Whole, I may very ju&s;tly draw up this Conclu&s;ion (the Rever&s;e of my <HI>Animadverter's) That if following the Explanations given of this Commi&s;&s;ion by Apo&s;tolick Practice be warrantable, the A&s;sertors of</HI> Pre&s;byterian Parity <HI>are undoubtedly in the Right.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>BEFORE I pa&s;s to his next general head, I might take No|tice of what he in&s;inuates here (1) concerning the <HI>Deacons, That we find in Fact, that the Apo&s;tles ordained them; be&s;ides &s;ome lower Offices, to preach and bapti&s;e.</HI> &mdash; By this he mu&s;t mean, Either that <HI>we find they in fact or|dain'd</HI> the Deacons to the works of <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Bapti|&s;ing;</HI> which is directly <HI>contrary</HI> to the Account we have of their In&s;titution, <HI>Act.</HI> 6. <HI>begin.</HI> &mdash; Or el&s;e that <HI>we find in Fact</HI> the Deacons <HI>did</HI> preach and bapti&s;e, &amp; from thence mu&s;t <HI>infer</HI> they were <HI>ordain'd</HI> to the&s;e Offices. Now if this be his Meaning, let him con&s;ult the <HI>Appen|dix</HI> (pag. 38, &amp;c.) and he will find I have &s;ufficiently ex|pos'd the Vanity of &s;uch Pretences, in a way of Arguing too &s;omewhat different from the <HI>Remarker;</HI> &s;o that the An|&s;wer to <HI>him</HI> will not &s;uffice for a Reply to <HI>Me:</HI> and yet the <HI>Animadverter</HI> &s;ilently pa&s;&s;es over my Ob&s;ervations on this Head, as he has done in many other In&s;tances &mdash; And now, as to what he affirms in the next Place, concern|ing <HI>Presbyters, That tho&s;e which the Apostles &s;ettled in

Nay, he turns it over to a <HI>Lay Chancellor,</HI> and other <HI>Officials</HI> of that Court, who have not any inherent and proper Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority, but are <HI>deputed</HI> by the Bi&s;hop; and who&s;e Acts, tho' they always run in the Bi&s;hop's <HI>Name,</HI> yet are not always pa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d with the Bi&s;hop's <HI>Con&s;ent:</HI> but however <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;ubmitted to, and comply'd with by the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who are in a manner only the Bi&s;hop's <HI>Curates,</HI> and dive&s;ted of all their &s;hare in the Government.&mdash; And then as to the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> the Power of the&s;e is not &s;o lodg'd with the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as that they may admini&s;ter them to tho&s;e <HI>Subjects,</HI> and in that <HI>Manner,</HI> which their own Judgment directs 'em to; but if they go to pur&s;ue this, they expo&s;e them&s;elves many times to great Inconvenien|cies, as the Hi&s;tory of SIXTY-TWO very loudly te&s;tifies.&mdash; Hence, when my <HI>Animadverter</HI> affirms, <HI>Presbyters</HI> had ori|ginally <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments and Cen&s;ures,</HI> He a&s;&s;erts a Truth, that ca&s;ts no little Reproach on the Practice of his own Church, as well as gives an oblique Stroke, fatal to his Cau&s;e.&mdash; And now as to what he ob|&s;erves, in the la&s;t place. <HI>That Dioce&s;an</HI> Bi&s;hops, <HI>in whom the Powers of Ordination &amp; Juri&s;diction over a Plura|lity of</HI> Presbyters <HI>&amp; Churches were annexed, were &s;et|tled by the Apo&s;tles, in their re&s;pective Sees;</HI> for Evi|dence of which he alleges the In&s;tances of <HI>Timothy,</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and the <HI>Apocalyptical Angels,</HI> and refers us to his <HI>Defence</HI> of the <HI>Mode&s;t Proof:</HI> I &s;hall make no Ob|&s;ervations upon it, but leave the <HI>Remarker</HI> to &s;ay <HI>how fully he has made this to appear.</HI></P>

<P>BUT then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o <HI>adju&s;t this Preliminary,</HI> I mu&s;t add an Ob&s;ervation or two. As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) THAT the <HI>Epi&s;copal Powers</HI> mentioned, were not <HI>peculiar</HI> to the Apo&s;tles, but common to all <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> or Presbyters: As plainly appears from what I have &s;aid above, &amp; have further to offer. And then it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, &mdash;</P>
<P N="2">(2.) AS to the <HI>Superiority</HI> over <HI>Presbyters,</HI> a&s;cri|bed to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> it is granted by me only in a <HI>re|&s;train'd</HI> and <HI>qualify'd</HI> Sen&s;e. Here,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> I wou'd not be under&s;tood to a&s;&s;ert a Superio|rity of proper imperative <HI>Prelatical Power,</HI> founded in a|ny peculiar Office or Commi&s;&s;ion held by Them; but a <HI>directive</HI> or <HI>declarative</HI> Power; Whereby they had a Right to in&s;truct Presbyters in the reveal'd Truths and Laws of the Go&s;pel, and inculcate their Duty upon them, to rebuke the Scandalous and Heretical, to pronounce 'em (if impenitent) unworthy of their Office, and warn the People to avoid them &amp;c. But as to any proper <HI>Imperi|al, Judicial,</HI> and <HI>Coercive</HI> Power over Them, I cannot

find any Foot&s;teps of it, either in the <HI>Acts</HI> or <HI>Letters</HI> of the Apo&s;tles; nor any Foundation for it, either in their Commi&s;&s;ion, or in any Rules of Rea&s;on. So that I can|not at pre&s;ent but conceive of the <HI>Apostles</HI> as being in relation to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Church, and the Pa&s;tors of it, very much what the in&s;pired <HI>Prophets</HI> in former times were to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church and its ordinary Teachers. But however,&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> I wou'd have it ob&s;erv'd, that whatever go|verning Power the Apo&s;tles might have over <HI>Presbyters</HI> or ordinary Pa&s;tors and the Churches.

But I will add, for the further Clearing of it, this Ob&s;er|vation, <HI>That the Apo&s;tles ordinary Capacity was</HI> SINGLE, <HI>and but one;</HI> or &s;uch as wherein they cou'd repre&s;ent but <HI>one Kind</HI> of <HI>Church-Ruler,</HI> and that is a <HI>Pari&s;h Rector</HI> or <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> of a particular Congregation, and not the <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Bi&s;hop. Which I &s;hall e&s;&s;ay to prove, in &s;uch a Gradati|on of Thought, as will make it Mathematically evident: and for the better Di&s;tinction, I will make u&s;e of Ordinal Numbers, in laying down my <HI>Propo&s;itions,</HI> which are the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Apo&s;tolical</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion is the grand <HI>Charter</HI> for the Evangelical Mini&s;try. This we have heard our A|nimadverter already confe&s;&s;ing. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>whole Complex</HI> of Apo&s;tolical Power, in the <HI>ordinary</HI> and permanent Branches of it, was included in that one Commi&s;&s;ion. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. THE Mini&s;terial Powers, contained in that Com|mi&s;&s;ion, were by the Apo&s;tles pre&s;erv'd <HI>undivided,</HI> and de|liver'd

<P N="4">4. THEY to whom this Commi&s;&s;ion truly belongs, are actually inve&s;ted with <HI>all</HI> the Powers given in it. Now,</P>
<P N="5">5. THOSE who are inve&s;ted with <HI>one Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> in all the Powers of it, mu&s;t be of one and the &s;ame <HI>Order</HI> or Kind. Therefore,</P>
<P N="6">6 AS the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion was but one, &s;o their ordinary Capacity was but one, and &s;uch as in which they cou'd repre&s;ent but one kind of <HI>Church-Ruler. Q. E. D.</HI></P>
<P>And now&mdash;</P>
<P N="7">7. THIS Church-Ruler is not the <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Bi&s;hop, but the <HI>Congregational</HI> Bi&s;hop, or Presbyter: As will ap|pear, if we duly weigh things. For con&s;ider, in the next place,</P>
<P N="8">8. THE Government of <HI>Prelates</HI> and that of <HI>Presby|ters</HI> are <HI>two Sorts</HI> of Government. This the Defender of the <HI>Mod. Proof</HI> takes notice of, <HI>pag.</HI> 21. Hence, in the</P>
<P N="9">9th place, THE <HI>Prelatical</HI> Bi&s;hop, and the <HI>Parochial,</HI> are two di&s;tinct Species of Officers. And con&s;equently, in the</P>
<P N="10">10th place, THEY <HI>cannot both</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;t on <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion, nor cou'd the Apo&s;tles repre&s;ent them <HI>both</HI> in their ordinary Capacity: but one or t'other mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be <HI>excluded.</HI> But now, in the</P>
<P N="11">11th place, WE are agreed on all &s;ides, that <HI>Congre|gational</HI> Bi&s;hops, or <HI>Presbyters,</HI> do act in the di&s;charge of their Office, <HI>by virtue</HI> of the <HI>Apostolical Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and by it are ve&s;ted with <HI>the Powers of Preaching, and of Sacraments and Cen&s;ures.</HI> To this we have a repeat|ed full Confe&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Animadverter.</HI> And hence, in the</P>

<P><HI>LAST</HI> place, That <HI>Praelatical</HI> Powers were <HI>not</HI> com|prehended in the <HI>Apostles</HI> ordinary Capacity, nor the Epi&s;copal Throne erected upon the Apo&s;tolic Commi&s;&s;i|on: and &s;o the Dioce&s;an Claim mu&s;t fall to the ground. For <HI>tho'</HI> Praelates <HI>are not excluded by Name</HI> (to allude to an Ob&s;ervation of our An&s;werer's &mdash; <HI>Def.</HI> pag. 65) <HI>Yet they are, by the Nature of Commi&s;&s;ions; all Commi&s;&s;ions being exclu&s;ive of all but tho&s;e to whom They are grant|ed.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have impartially weigh'd the Gentleman's <HI>three Preliminaries, adju&s;ted</HI> 'em, and corrected the undue <HI>Turn of Tho't,</HI> which his Di&s;cour&s;e upon them might tend to give &s;uch as are looking into <HI>this Controver&s;y:</HI> and hope I have left him no Room to rai&s;e any more Du&s;t, on the&s;e Topicks, to cloud and darken them.</P>
<P>&para; I proceed now to con&s;ider what he has advanc'd on two or three <HI>Texts,</HI> which he wou'd have the World be|lieve <HI>I have mi&s;taken &amp; mi&s;applied:</HI> and <HI>by &s;etting of which in their true Light,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>all that I have offered, will be fully reply'd to.</HI> He re&s;olves <HI>now to take bold on the Impartial Hand, if it is not too nim|ble or ill-natured to be taken in its own way.</HI> Well, let him take <HI>what Hold</HI> he plea&s;es, (where &amp; how he will) I hope the <HI>Impartial Hand</HI> will be <HI>nimble</HI> enough to manage him; and that without being &s;o <HI>ill-natur'd</HI> as to offer any foul Play. Let unprejudic'd Standers-by judge between us. To begin then,</P>
<P>&sect; 1. THE fir&s;t Text he mentions, is 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1 6. (which &s;peaks of <HI>the putting on of</HI> Paul<HI>'s Hands</HI>) But is the wrong Text: it &s;hould have been 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14. which &s;peaks of <HI>the Laying on of the Hands of the</HI> Presbytery.</P>
<P>AND here the Gentleman, in an Exce&s;s of good Na|ture, (&s;hall I &s;ay? or through the force of Conviction)
<PB N="22" REF="002636_0024_0FE5D795AE9A1978">
is willing to <HI>take me in my own way, by condemning</HI> Calvin<HI>'s In&s;titutes</HI> [tho' in &s;o doing, as it unhappily falls out, he condemns his own <HI>Defen&s;e</HI> of <HI>Mod. Proof,</HI> (pag. 28.) which interprets the word <HI>Presbytery,</HI> of the <HI>Office transferred on</HI> Timothy, <HI>at his Ordination by St.</HI> Paul's own Hands,] and <HI>admitting</HI> my <HI>Comment on the Text,</HI> viz. <HI>That</HI> Timothy <HI>was ordain'd by a College of Presby|ters. But then,</HI> he tells me <HI>I must grant al&s;o, that tho&s;e</HI> Presbyters <HI>were either</HI> Apo&s;tles, <HI>or meer &s;ingle</HI> Presbyters, <HI>and</HI> Paul <HI>pre&s;iding among them in either ca&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>IF the Fir&s;t,</HI> then he concludes, <HI>his Point is gained; for</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>the Apostles were not only</HI> Presbyters, <HI>but</HI> Bi&s;hops <HI>al&s;o in the full and &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e of the word, by the third Preliminary; and this will &s;ave the Credit and the Evidence of the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to</HI> Timothy <HI>for Epi&s;copacy, and be exactly agreeable to the practice of the Church of</HI> England.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT, by <HI>Presbytery</HI> here, to under&s;tand a number of <HI>Apostles,</HI> joyning with <HI>Paul,</HI> in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy,</HI> is very <HI>irrational.</HI> 'Tis an Expo&s;ition intirely Conjectural, and carries not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of <HI>Probabi|lity</HI> with it.</P>
<P>FOR (be&s;ides other Rea&s;ons) it is extreme unlikely that <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hould be&s;tow on a College of <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> no higher Denomination than this of <HI>a Presbytery:</HI> and then (agreeably to what I ob&s;erv'd in <HI>Append.</HI> to <HI>Sob. Rem.</HI> pag. 18. &mdash; tho' my <HI>Animadverter</HI> has made no Re|turn to me upon it) 'tis equally improbable, that <HI>Paul</HI> (&s;o humble an Apo&s;tle) &s;hould have the Vanity to <HI>di&s;|tingui&s;h</HI> him&s;elf from his Brethren, and <HI>exalt</HI> him&s;elf above them, in the manner our Opponents make him to do, by the Sen&s;e they put upon 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6. where they &s;uppo&s;e him to affirm, <HI>That</HI> Timothy <HI>was</HI> ordained <HI>by the Laying on of</HI> His <HI>Hands;</HI> as if it were his <HI>Sole Act,</HI> and the whole Virtue and Efficacy flow'd from <HI>his</HI> Hand. Which if it be true, I cannot imagine Them to be <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> that are meant by <HI>the Presbytery:</HI> For the Apo&s;tles were all <HI>equally</HI> ve&s;ted with ordaining Power:
<PB N="23" REF="002636_0025_0FE5D738597B1240">
And it would not be con&s;i&s;tent with the u&s;ual <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Humility</HI> of this Apo&s;tle's Language, in all other Ca&s;es, when &s;peaking of Him&s;elf, for him to u&s;e &s;uch a Speech in this Ca&s;e, as excludes the Re&s;t of his Brethren from any &s;hare in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy;</HI> which mu&s;t be judg'd very vain, as well as fal&s;e.</P>
<P>However,</P>
<P N="2">2. ADMIT that by <HI>the Presbytery</HI> is meant a College of <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> yet my <HI>Animadverter</HI> is very &s;hort in his Rea&s;oning, and labours of a grand Mi&s;take, when he con|cludes <HI>his Point to be gain'd thereby:</HI> nor will that Con|ce&s;&s;ion at all hurt the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Claim and Argument from the Text under Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>FOR thus I argue upon the pre&s;ent Hypothe&s;is: The&s;e Apo&s;tles acted in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination, either in their ordinary or extraordinary Capacity. <HI>Not</HI> in their <HI>extra-ordinary;</HI> for then it affords no Example or Argument for Ordination by <HI>ordinary</HI> Officers. Whereas, on all &s;ides it is allow'd and pleaded as a <HI>&s;ufficient Warrant</HI> for Ordination by ordinary Officers: &mdash; therefore it was their <HI>ordinary Capacity</HI> in which they ordained. And hence they who <HI>&s;ucceed</HI> the Apo&s;tles in their whole <HI>ordi|nary Capacity,</HI> mu&s;t be entituled to the Power of Ordi|nation.</P>
<P>NOW here lies the Difficulty, to know <HI>who</HI> are their proper Succe&s;&s;ors: which can be determin'd only by in|quiring <HI>what</HI> the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their ordinary Capacity were; what Powers they had, and what Acts they did. And for our Information here we mu&s;t look into their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and into their <HI>Hi&s;tory:</HI> both whereof have been already con&s;ulted; and it appears from them, That the Apo&s;tles, con&s;idered in their ordinary Capacity, were only <HI>Presbyters.</HI> This has been made evident from the Ac|counts of <HI>Fact</HI> and the Practice of the Apo&s;tles: And it is a mo&s;t genuine Deduction from the <HI>original Charter,</HI> given them by our Lord, that de&s;cribes their <HI>Work,</HI> in the <HI>&s;uperior</HI> and <HI>main</HI> permanent branches of it, and pre|&s;cribes nothing expre&s;ly but what is the allow'd &amp; undoubt|ed Duty of ordinary <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> or <HI>Pa&s;tors:</HI> which affords
<PB N="24" REF="002636_0026_0FE5D75DD13CCFB0">
a &s;trong pre&s;umptive Argument, that the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> in their ordinary and abiding Character, were really but <HI>Presbyters.</HI> Therefore all tho&s;e who are truly ordain'd to the Office of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> do &s;ucceed to the <HI>Apostles</HI> in the <HI>full Extent</HI> of their ordinary Capacity, and are to be look'd upon as inve&s;ted with the Plenitude of their mini&s;terial and continuing Powers: One of which being <HI>Ordination,</HI> this nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Inference</HI> plainly ari&s;es, and forceably urges our A&s;&s;ent, <HI>That Presbyters have the Ordaining Power committed to them,</HI> and lodg'd in their Hands, as <HI>their Peculiar,</HI> exclu&s;ively (in common Ca&s;es at lea&s;t) of all others not rightly ordain'd to the Office of Presbyters, and &s;o not truly &s;u&s;taining the ordinary Character of the Apo&s;tles.&mdash; Upon the whole then it appears, We offer no <HI>Injury</HI> at all to the Plea for <HI>Pres|byterian</HI> Ordination, taken from <HI>the Laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery,</HI> although we allow this to refer to a Company of <HI>Apostles:</HI> Becau&s;e it mu&s;t be granted, if they were Apo&s;tles, They ordain'd by virtue of their <HI>ordinary Power,</HI> which I've prov'd amounted to no more than that of <HI>Presbyters.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED my <HI>Animadverter</HI> tells us, <HI>The Apostles were not only Presbyters, but</HI> Bi&s;hops <HI>al&s;o in the full &amp; &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word.</HI> To which I reply; If he intends here the <HI>&s;ound</HI> Sen&s;e of the Word, as us'd in <HI>Scripture,</HI> I have nothing to object. But, I think, invincible Objecti|ons lie in the way, if he intends the modern <HI>Eccle&s;iastical</HI> Sen&s;e of the Word. For, <HI>thus</HI> taken, it is applicable to none but <HI>Dioce&s;an Prelates;</HI> whom the Animadverter de&s;cribes (<HI>pag.</HI> 10.) as tho&s;e that have in them <HI>the Power of Ordination, and Juri&s;diction over a Plurality of Presbyters, and Churches, annexed,</HI> and <HI>are</HI> &s;ettled <HI>in their re&s;pective</HI> SEES. Now I de&s;ire to know whether He will apply <HI>this</HI> Definition to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and &s;o make them <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> in the <HI>full</HI> and <HI>stricte&s;t</HI> Sen&s;e of the Word, as us'd by the <HI>Moderns.</HI> And after he has re&s;olv'd us on this head, I mu&s;t give him the further Trouble of producing &s;ome good Evidence, that the <HI>modern Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical U&s;e</HI> of the Word is agreeable to the <HI>Scripture-Sen&s;e</HI> of it: Becau&s;e for my own part, after my be&s;t In|quiries

<P>BUT let it be ob&s;erv'd here: The Gentleman has for|got (what I intimated in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> and what many learned Men do agree to, <HI>viz.</HI>) That it's probable, <HI>Paul</HI>'s putting on of his Hands was not in <HI>Conjunction</HI> with the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> but at a <HI>di&s;tinct Time,</HI> and upon a different De&s;ign; his Impo&s;ition of Hands being in order to the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, and theirs for Ordination, and &s;o might be at <HI>&s;everal</HI> Times.

But, I think, <HI>Paul</HI>'s Pre&s;idency in <HI>either</HI> Ca&s;e, imported no more than the Power and Province of a <HI>Moderator,</HI> appointed for Order's &s;ake. In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Ca&s;e, or upon Suppo&s;ition They were <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> who joyned in Lay|ing on of Hands, I am prone to believe my <HI>Animadver|ter</HI> will a&s;cribe nothing more to Him, &s;eeing They <HI>all</HI> had an inherent Power of ordaining as well as he. And why <HI>any more</HI> &s;hould be a&s;cribed to him in the <HI>other</HI> Ca&s;e, or &s;uppo&s;ing them to be <HI>Presbyters,</HI> I cannot divine. For, that <HI>Paul</HI> lay'd on Hands (under his <HI>common</HI> No|tion) as a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> and not under any <HI>di&s;tinctive</HI> Charac|ter, as a <HI>&s;uperior</HI> Officer, or <HI>Head,</HI> is a Con&s;equence very fairly deducible from the cho&s;en <HI>Style</HI> of the Text; where he &s;peaks of the whole Con&s;i&s;tory of Ordainers, as a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> taking in <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> among the Re&s;t, without any mark of <HI>Di&s;tinction:</HI> which, as it carries with it an Intimation, that <HI>all</HI> the Members of the Body had a pro|per <HI>Agency</HI> in the Ordination; So it naturally leads us to infer, That <HI>Paul</HI> exerted no more <HI>ordaining</HI> Power than any common Member, and had not the Influence of a &s;upreme <HI>Head,</HI> as &s;ome vainly dream. And indeed, if I mi&s;take not, the fix'd notion of a <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> (the Name, my Animadverter applies to the Apo&s;tle in this Ca&s;e) can carry his Power to no higher a pitch than that of a <HI>Moderator,</HI> who (as I hinted before) is con&s;tituted only for <HI>order's</HI> &s;ake, and has no more intrin&s;ick Power than any others belonging to the Society.</P>
<P>I might illu&s;trate this to our Animadverter, by the <HI>Con&s;ecration</HI> of a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> in his own Church: in which the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> pre&s;ides, but yet is only the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the A&s;&s;embly, and has no more authoritative Influence into the Ordination (by any &s;uperior Degree of ordaining Power inherent in him) than the Re&s;t of his <HI>Fellow-Bi&s;hops,</HI> that joyn with him in the Action; as appears by the <HI>Form</HI> of Con&s;ecration of Bi&s;hops, and in that the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> claims no Superiority of <HI>order</HI> to other Pre|lates, nor indeed any &s;uperior <HI>Degree</HI> of Power, as of <HI>Divine Right,</HI> but as ari&s;ing only out of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Civil Laws and Cu&s;toms. And hence, in <HI>that Ca&s;e,</HI> the Practice of the Church of <HI>England</HI> is exactly agreeable to the Practice of the Churches of <HI>New England,</HI> in the or|dination
<PB N="29" REF="002636_0031_0FE5D7A87B91F060">
of a Mini&s;ter; in which we have a <HI>Moderator</HI> to pre&s;ide, who is of the &s;ame Cla&s;s with the other Pa&s;tors.</P>
<P>SO that <HI>Paul</HI>'s Pre&s;idency in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination, can afford our Opponents nothing of an Argument to plead again&s;t <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ordinations. And truly (to borrow a Hint from the <HI>Remarker</HI>) <Q>That gives us no more grounds to &s;u&s;pect that the <HI>Presbyters</HI> had not full power and authority to ordain <HI>by them&s;elves,</HI> than it does to &s;u&s;pect whether the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> had power to or|dain by him&s;elf.</Q> At lea&s;t it can be no more an ob|jection again&s;t Ordination by <HI>Presbyters</HI> alone (without Bi&s;hops) than by <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> alone, without Presbyters. And yet how con&s;tantly is this practiced in the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> in all Con&s;ecrations to the <HI>Epi&s;copate!</HI> Here only the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop,</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hops pre&s;ent,</HI> are concern'd&punc; no meer <HI>Presbyters</HI> are admitted to joyn.

Hence he has left the way open for one or other of tho&s;e <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> to take place, that I have pur&s;u'd his Friend with (in my <HI>Appendix,</HI> p. 10, 11) either of which, I think, grate hard enough on him.

<P>IT is plain, the <HI>Ordainers</HI> do not <HI>confer</HI> the Power, but only <HI>confirm,</HI> approve, inve&s;t, and the like. They are at mo&s;t but In&s;truments of Conveyance, or rather of <HI>Con|firmation</HI> and publick In&s;tallment.

So when my Lord <HI>Chancellor</HI> &s;eals a <HI>Patent, he</HI> gives no Power at all. So the <HI>Mayor</HI> of a City derives all his Power from the <HI>Prince</HI>'s Charter, and not at all from the <HI>Recorder</HI> or <HI>Steward,</HI> who performs the Ceremony of Inauguration.

<P><PB N="35" REF="002636_0037_0FE5D7B91E7954A0">THUS I have given you a rational Account of the Na|ture of <HI>Ordination,</HI> from &s;ome of the Writers, and Pub|lick Formula's of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and illu&s;trated the Matter by various Similitudes. I've in&s;i&s;ted on this Point the longer, becau&s;e my <HI>Animadverter</HI>'s mi&s;take about the <HI>Nature of the Action</HI> [as if it were the <HI>Con|ferring an Office, and Giving the Powers for its Execu|tion</HI>] is what I apprehend to be the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the grand Fallacy in his Scheme. Do but rectify this, and matters will come to Rights. Let him get this Notion once out of his Head, and entertain tho&s;e <HI>just Idea's</HI> that his own Church and his Brethren have formed for him; and it mu&s;t needs go a great way towards convincing him, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> are capable and very proper Per&s;ons to perform the bu&s;ine&s;s of Ordination: at lea&s;t I'm per&s;uaded, He'll never more imagine it <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for a <HI>Plurality</HI> to ordain together, nor ever again attempt to <HI>demon&s;trate it to be &s;o from the Nature of the Thing.</HI> For, what is there in the <HI>Nature of the Action,</HI> as it has now been de&s;crib'd, that &s;hould &s;peak it <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to be perform'd by a Number of Per&s;ons in Conjunction? Where is the Difficulty? Whence the Ab&s;urdity? Is it impo&s;&s;ible for a <HI>Society</HI> to make <HI>one Prayer, and one De|claration,</HI> and the like, <HI>together?</HI> I pray, why may not a <HI>Community</HI> of Pa&s;tors &s;eparate and ordain a <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> as well as a <HI>College of Phy&s;icians</HI> approbate and licence one of <HI>their</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion, as the known Cu&s;tom is!</P>
<P>BUT now for once I am willing to drop the Notion I have bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> contending for, and allow that the Ordainers do not merely <HI>recognize</HI> the Authority given by Chri&s;t's Charter, but really <HI>confer</HI> the Office and the Powers for its Execution, (as my Animadverter words him&s;elf) yet I can't &s;ee but that <HI>This</HI> is very reconcilable with a <HI>Plu|rality</HI> of Ordainers, It's ob&s;ervable, When the <HI>Deacons</HI> Office was in&s;tituted, and a Number of Per&s;ons <HI>appointed over this Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> (as we read <HI>Act.</HI> 6.) all the <HI>Twelve</HI> Apo&s;tles concurred in it.

Truly it's all over a Vi&s;ionary Flight, mere Amu&s;ement!

<P>BUT &s;ince the Gentleman is for an Argument from <HI>the Nature of the Action,</HI> I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to him, that <HI>Impo&s;ition of Hands</HI> has always been look'd upon as an <HI>ordaining Act,</HI> and importing an ordaining Power, in the Per&s;on perform|ing it.

And would our Animadverter allow mere <HI>Laymen</HI> to u&s;e this Ceremony, for that end! Which perhaps they might inno|cently enough do, it it may be u&s;ed at all for that end. Methinks, had the Presbyters been mere <HI>Con&s;enters,</HI> an audible <HI>Amen</HI> at the clo&s;e of the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s Prayer, or <HI>giving the Right Hand</HI> to <HI>Timothy,</HI> after his Ordination, would have &s;ufficiently an&s;wer'd the End, without their <HI>Laying on Hands</HI> with <HI>Paul,</HI> which (be&s;ides the needle&s;s Trouble to them) would be likely to prove a Snare in future times, by leading <HI>Presbyters</HI> into bold Pretences under Colour of a primitive Example.

I can|not then but look upon this Gentleman as flying in the face of his <HI>Mother</HI> the Church of <HI>England,</HI> when he de|nys the ordaining Power of Presbyters; and as loading his <HI>Fathers,</HI> the Bi&s;hops, with the Imputation of a grand Ab&s;urdity, in their &s;aying to the Prie&s;t ordained, &mdash;<HI>Receive the Holy Gho&s;t for the Work now committed to Thee by the Impo&s;ition of</HI> OUR <HI>Hands;</HI> &mdash; when he a&s;&s;erts it to be <HI>impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> in the Nature of the Thing, for a <HI>Plurality</HI> to have a joynt Intere&s;t or In&s;trumentality in the mini&s;terial Conveyance of the Prie&s;ts Office.

<P>I have &s;et down his Argument here at length, that you may &s;ee the whole Force it carrys in Bar to my Charac|ter of tho&s;e Ordainers: And I mu&s;t confe&s;s, if he had not put his Conclu&s;ion in &s;uch <HI>strong</HI> Terms (but in&s;tead of <HI>really were,</HI> had &s;aid, <HI>might be</HI>) it would have been the mo&s;t hand&s;om <HI>Eva&s;ion</HI> that I ever met with on this head. But that it is <HI>only</HI> an Eva&s;ion, a thin Sophi&s;m, and con|tains nothing of &s;olid Rea&s;on, I hope will (upon a cool debate of the Matter) appear, even to <HI>his own</HI> impartial Reflections. Here then to put it in it's genuine Light,</P>
<P N="1">1. LET us try how <HI>this way</HI> of Rea&s;oning will hold in <HI>other Ca&s;es</HI> of the <HI>like Nature.</HI></P>
<P>FOR In&s;tance; Suppo&s;e the Government of the Colo|ny of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> (which I particularly mention, for a good Rea&s;on) were &s;poken of, and their Names &s;et down in &s;ome public Records; &mdash; but all under the common Style of <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Rulers:</HI> Would our Animad|verter now, becau&s;e he finds a <HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Deputy-Governour</HI> among Them, hence conclude them <HI>all</HI> to be of &s;uch &s;uperior Characters? How ab&s;urd! How ridi|culous!</P>
<P>BUT a Scripture-In&s;tance may perhaps be more agree|able. We have one in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.5. Where we find <HI>Paul</HI>

<P N="2">2.

<P N="1">(1.)

<P>Dr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;o renders it,&mdash; <HI>Now there were Some in An|tioch.</HI> BELONGING <HI>to the Church that then was, Prophets and Doctors.</HI> &mdash; That is, <HI>that then was at Antioch,</HI> as I think the Rules of Con&s;truction do oblige us to explain it: altho' the <HI>Doctor</HI> in his Paraphra&s;e &s;tretches the Sen&s;e, and takes in <HI>the Churches of</HI> Syria <HI>of that Age,</HI> of which he &s;uppo&s;es tho&s;e Prophets and Teachers to be <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI> Which is a Con&s;truction I can't devi&s;e what &s;hou'd lead him into, but an odd Notion he was &s;o fond of, as if <HI>Every City had a Bi&s;hop, and cou'd have no

more than one.</HI> But I think, <HI>His critical Note,</HI> as I have explain'd it, is preferrable to <HI>his Paraphra&s;e,</HI> and car|ries abundantly more rational Probability with it. For ob&s;erve, among tho&s;e Prophets and Teachers we find <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Barnabas,</HI> who cannot with any colour of Rea|&s;on be called <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of <HI>Syria.</HI> And then the phra&s;e of the Text is &s;uch as &s;peaks it to be a <HI>particular Church,</HI> that tho&s;e Per&s;ons are &s;aid to belong unto. For it is, <HI>the Church,</HI> in the &s;ingular number; a particular Church; and mu&s;t (by the mo&s;t ea&s;y &amp; natural Interpretation) mean the Church at <HI>Antioch,</HI> which is mentioned immediately before. Whereas, when <HI>Provinces</HI> and <HI>Countries</HI> are referr'd to, the <HI>Plural</HI> Number is us'd. So we read of <HI>the Churches of</HI> Judea, <HI>the Churches of</HI> A&s;ia, <HI>the Chur|ches of</HI> Galatia <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore it is very unlikely that the Apo&s;tle &s;hould refer to the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Syria,</HI> in our Text. But by comparing this with other places of the like Importance, the Ca&s;e will appear plainer. Thus, 1 Cor. 1.2. <GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;. So in 2 Cor. 1.1 we have the &s;ame Words repeated. Which are by the Doctor without any difficulty tran&s;lated. <HI>To the Church which is at Corinth.</HI> And why by <HI>the Church</HI> in our Text we &s;hould not under&s;tand, <HI>The Church which is at Antioch,</HI> (notwith&s;tanding a little Tran&s;|po&s;ition of the words in our Text) I know of no &s;ignifi|cant Rea&s;on. For ought I can &s;ee, the Text may very well be read thus.&mdash; <HI>Now there were certain Prophets and Teachers belonging to the Church, that was in An|tioch;</HI> or, <HI>There were Teachers in</HI> Antioch, <HI>belonging to the Church then being,</HI> in that City. I may here allude to &s;ome of my Animadverter's Expre&s;&s;ions (in another place <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Def.</HI> p. 35.</NOTE>) and &s;ay;&mdash;<HI>The Sen&s;e will not &s;uffer at all by this Tran&s;lation; There is nothing in the Original that hinders its being exactly &s;o rendered; unle&s;s it be the Cau&s;e of Epi&s;copacy.</HI></P>
<P>AND corre&s;pondent to my Reading is that of Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> who &s;o tran&s;lates it,&mdash;<HI>There were &s;ome Pro|phets and Teachers in Antioch belonging to that Church.</HI> And he vouch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the learned <HI>Grotius</HI> for it.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="002636_0046_0FE5D7C5A2F50D08">IT appears then, in the Judgment of the&s;e great Men, that the <HI>Church</HI> &s;poken of was that at <HI>Antioch;</HI> and it is agreed to by Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> that (whatever the Church was) <HI>The&s;e Prophets &amp; Teachers did</HI> BELONG <HI>unto it.</HI></P>
<P>NOW it is a fix'd and invariable Maxim, in our Oppo|nents Scheme,&mdash; <HI>But one Bi&s;hop in a Church.</HI>&mdash;Whereas, here is a <HI>Number</HI> of Teachers, belonging to <HI>one</HI> and the &s;ame Church.

Surely he can have no Temptation to &s;uppo&s;e them <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> or <HI>Prelates,</HI> &s;ave that he finds them <HI>laying on of Hands:</HI> but this carries no Print at all of either Cha|racter; becau&s;e it is an Action we find performed by <HI>Presbyters</HI> (as I have &s;hewn before) in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy,</HI> &amp; in the Ordinations of his own Church.</P>
<P>BUT here enters in upon me an Objection, that &s;eems to lie again&s;t the Con&s;truction of our Text, given above, making tho&s;e <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> to <HI>belong</HI> unto the Church at <HI>Antioch:</HI> And we may imagin our Animad|verter to be laying it down thus,&mdash;</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>WELL but</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Barnabas <HI>were among tho&s;e</HI> Prophets <HI>and</HI> Teachers. <HI>And they cannot be &s;aid to</HI> be|long <HI>to that Church, becau&s;e</HI> Apo&s;tles: <HI>And therefore it will follow that no more did the others.</HI></P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer,</P>
<P>THAT, &s;ince the <HI>greater Part</HI> belong'd to that Church, it makes no &s;uch Alteration, as to hurt my Ar|gument, altho' we &s;hould allow an <HI>Exception</HI> of <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> out of the Number. <HI>Paul</HI> was an Apo&s;tle, and was &s;o at that time, I confe&s;s. But that <HI>Barnabas</HI> was an Apo&s;tle <HI>before</HI> his going with <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> upon the Mi&s;&s;ion our Text relates to, I never yet could &s;ee any &s;ufficient Evidence.

unu&s;ual method with the Writers on that Side; however, we cannot believe them, when the A&s;&s;ertion appears plainly fal&s;e as it does in this Ca&s;e.</HI> For before that Mi&s;&s;ion, we don't hear of <HI>Barnabas</HI>'s doing any thing more than the common Work of a <HI>Preacher.</HI> In the la&s;t Account we have of him, before that in our Text, we find the CHURCH <HI>at Jeru&s;alem</HI> SENDING <HI>him forth, that he &s;hould go as fat as Antioch: who when he came there,</HI> exported <HI>them all; &mdash; for he was a good Man</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Then,</HI> after he had preached to them awhile with good Succe&s;s, <HI>he departed to Tar&s;us for to &s;eek</HI> Saul; <HI>and when he had found him, he brought him unto</HI> Antioch. (<HI>Acts</HI> 11.22 <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) Now for the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>End</HI> of this, I will refer my Animadverter to one of his own Bre|thren (Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI>) who&s;e Paraphra&s;e on the place runs thus, &mdash; <Q><HI>Then departed Barnabas</HI> (from Antioch) <HI>to Tar&s;us, to &s;eek</HI> Saul, (perhaps that he being an <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> might lay his Hands on &s;ome of them, that they might receive the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> Acts 8.17.) <HI>And when he had found him</HI> &amp;c.</Q> &mdash; Here we have this learned Prelati&s;t hinting his Opinion, that <HI>Barnabas</HI> at that time was <HI>not</HI> an <HI>Apo&s;tle.</HI> And if &s;o, then only <HI>Saul</HI> is left, appearing to be of that Character: and he is mention'd la&s;t. <HI>Barnabas</HI> begins the Catalogue: and <HI>Saul</HI> fini&s;hes it, who might be placed <HI>after</HI> all, becau&s;e (<HI>He</HI> being an <HI>Apostle,</HI> and <HI>They</HI> only <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI>) they did more &s;trictly and properly <HI>belong</HI> to the Church at <HI>Antioch,</HI> than He. However, I am willing for the pre&s;ent to humour the matter, &amp; take my Antagoni&s;t in his own way, by admitting <HI>Barnabas</HI> to be an <HI>Apostle,</HI> before the Mi&s;&s;ion our Text relates to: which will make two of the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> &s;poken of, <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> Neverthele&s;s the <HI>greater</HI> Number &s;till remains, who in a &s;trict Sen&s;e belong'd to that Church, as the ordinary Teachers of it.

Ob&s;erve it, I have before produced &s;uch Con&s;iderations, as carry in them a good force of Argument, that <HI>They</HI> who &s;epa|rated <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> were of the Number of tho&s;e who were &s;cattered abroad by the Per&s;ection at <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> and who then went down to <HI>Antioch;</HI> preaching the Word there: and that therefore at that time they were but <HI>Presbyters.</HI> And now that they were not any of them advanced to the <HI>Apostolate</HI> or the <HI>Epi&s;copate,</HI> when <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> went to <HI>Antioch,</HI> &s;eems a rational Conclu&s;ion; for that otherwi&s;e <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI>'s going thither mu&s;t have been needle&s;s, as to any thing that peculiarly concern'd the Work of an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> or the Office of a <HI>Bi&s;hop.</HI> But whatever may be the Strength of this Plea, in Objection to my <HI>Animadverter</HI>'s precari|ous Hypothe&s;is: let me add,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I am &s;ure, In the whole Affair of <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI>'s Mi&s;&s;ion, there is not the lea&s;t Intimation of any thing that carrys even the Shadow of <HI>Prelacy;</HI> no Hint of any one that had the Supremacy over the Re&s;t.

<P>THE De&s;ign, upon which I u&s;ed this Text, was to prove, that <HI>Teaching</HI> is a more honorable Office than <HI>Ruling:</HI> and that therefore, admitting <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Pres|byters</HI> to be two di&s;tinct Orders, yet <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> are not <HI>Su|perior</HI> to them. And here after &s;everal Hints pre|mi&s;ed, I came to argue from the <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> which the Apo&s;tle (in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17.) puts upon the <HI>Elders</HI> that <HI>labour in the Word;</HI> requiring pecu|liar <HI>Honours</HI> to be paid <HI>Them,</HI> above the Elders that la|bour in <HI>Rule:</HI> which I pre&s;um'd, He would not have done, if the Elders that <HI>rule</HI> (yea and rule <HI>well</HI>) had been more honourable than their Brethren.&mdash; Now the <HI>Animadverter</HI> &s;ingles out <HI>this Text,</HI> and makes his Exceptions again&s;t my Remarks upon it.

Does it intitule him to greater Honors than are due to his <HI>Brother-Coun&s;illour?</HI> I trow not. But why not? The Rea&s;on is obvious,&mdash; Becau&s;e the <HI>&s;uper added</HI> Office, which he holds, is <HI>inferior</HI> to that which is <HI>common</HI> to them both.

From whence we may fairly argue that &s;uch as are ve&s;ted with the Pow|ers of <HI>Preaching,</HI> have a ju&s;t Title to Honours, equal to what are owing to <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> who&s;e governing Powers can give them no Claim to any peculiar Re&s;pects.</P>
<P>OR, if the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> then by the Apo&s;tle's Rule here, a &s;pecial Regard is to be paid unto <HI>tho&s;e Pa&s;tors,</HI> that ex|cel in the <HI>be&s;t Gifts,</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>u&s;eful Labours;</HI> which be determines to be tho&s;e of <HI>Preaching.</HI> Mini&s;ters are to be honour'd <HI>for their Work &s;ake;</HI> which comprehends tho&s;e two great Lines of Duty, <HI>Governing</HI> and <HI>Preach|ing.</HI> But <HI>Preaching</HI> is the <HI>main</HI> and <HI>more eminent</HI> part of their Work. &mdash; Now &s;ome excel in one of tho&s;e, and others in t'other. And <HI>All</HI> are to be accounted worthy of double Honour; but <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> they who excel (as to Skill, Fidelity, and Application) in <HI>Preaching,</HI> which is the Work that carries in its Nature, the greate&s;t <HI>Dignity,</HI> and gives any the <HI>more exalted Character.</HI> And accord|ingly our <HI>Animadverter</HI> does el&s;ewhere (<HI>Def. of Mod. Proof,</HI> p. 24.) interpret the Text, as a <HI>Rule</HI> not only to the <HI>People,</HI> for the Direction of <HI>their</HI> Conduct towards their <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> but al&s;o as a Rule to <HI>Timothy,</HI> for the Direction of <HI>his</HI> Conduct towards Them, <HI>To prefer the de&s;eruing.</HI> And at the &s;ame time, it is ob&s;ervable, the <HI>Apostle</HI> declares tho&s;e to be the <HI>mo&s;t de&s;erving,</HI> who ap|prove them&s;elves the mo&s;t skilful, faithful, and laborious

<HI>Preachers.</HI> He &s;ingles out The&s;e for the fir&s;t <HI>Prefer|ments,</HI> and recommends them to <HI>Timothy,</HI> to receive the &s;pecial Marks of his Favour.</P>
<P>IT remains now only to &s;hew (if the <HI>Elders</HI> &s;poken of, be of the &s;ame Order) that one or t'other of tho&s;e <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> mu&s;t be admitted; by proving that the Sen&s;e my <HI>Animadverter</HI> is for, who (by a &s;trong Effort of Imagination) &s;uppo&s;es them to be <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops,</HI> is intirely wrong, and mu&s;t be rejected. And to prove they were not <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops,</HI> I will chu&s;e out three Argu|ments, which the Gentleman him&s;elf has furni&s;hed me withal; enough to plunge him into inextricable La|byrinths.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS Notion is &s;uper&s;eded by his own <HI>Glo&s;s</HI> upon our Text, but now mention'd, making it a <HI>Rule to Bi&s;hop Timothy,</HI> for his Direction in the <HI>Government</HI> of his Presbyters, <HI>To prefer the De&s;eruing.</HI> &mdash; Which may at lea&s;t have the Force of an <HI>Argumentum ad Hominem.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE Gentleman has effectually di&s;mounted that Hy|pothe&s;is, by a <HI>Conce&s;&s;ion</HI> He hath made el&s;ewhere <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Def.</HI> p. 21. <HI>Append.</HI> p. 10.</NOTE>, viz. That Presbyters <HI>have a Government over their &s;ingle Congregations,</HI> and are ve&s;ted with <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments and Cen&s;ures.</HI> By allowing of which, he has thrown a fatal Block in his own way, and put it out of his Power to prove, That by the <HI>Elders that rule well,</HI> are nece&s;&s;arily to be under&s;tood <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops,</HI> and not Con|gregational Pa&s;tors.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT mu&s;t be conclu&s;ive in this Di&s;pute, to ob&s;erve, He him&s;elf tells us here, That <HI>he thinks I am &s;o far in the</HI> RIGHT, <HI>as to</HI> grant that the Elders in both parts of our Text, <HI>are the &s;ame, and that I allow</HI> 1 The&s;. 5.12. <HI>to be a good Comment on the Text.</HI> &mdash; For, if I am &s;o far in the Right, then I'm &s;ure I &s;hall be in the Right al&s;o, if I af|firm the Elders in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. are of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me Species with tho&s;e i 4 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5. &mdash; And I am equally &s;ure then they could not be <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Prelates: Becau&s;e the <HI>The&s;&s;aloni|an</HI> Elders were but <HI>Pari&s;hional</HI> or <HI>Congregational</HI> Bi&s;hops; as will plainly appear to every one, upon the &s;edate Con|&s;ideration of a few Things.  <GAP DESC="blank">  As,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="58" REF="002636_0060_0FE5D76934236980">(1.) THERE was a <HI>Plurality</HI> of the&s;e Pre&s;idents or Over&s;eers in that one Church. Therefore they could not be <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THERE is no &s;pecial Mark put upon any <HI>&s;ingle Per&s;on</HI> among them, as having a Prerogative above the Re&s;t: but they are all &s;poken of under one common De|nomination of <HI>Pre&s;idents.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> It de|notes Superintendency, or Epi&s;copacy. Which being at|tributed to them all, without di&s;tinction, it argues they were a Company of <HI>Congregational Bi&s;hops,</HI> acting in an Equality: no one Man being <HI>Head</HI> of the Presbytery; unle&s;s it were under the notion of a <HI>Moderator,</HI> for Or|der's &s;ake.  <GAP DESC="blank">  And then,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) THEY are de&s;cribed, not only as being over the Flock, but as <HI>labouring</HI> AMONG <HI>them, and admoni&s;h|ing them:</HI> which imports a Per&s;onal Communica, and immediate Watch, in execution of the <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> Charge.</P>
<P N="4">(4) THE <HI>Church</HI> is requir'd to <HI>know Them,</HI> and to e&s;teem, and love Them, for their <HI>Work's &s;ake:</HI> which ne|ce&s;&s;arily pre&s;uppo&s;es their <HI>Re&s;idence</HI> in the City, and ar|gues them to be Parochial Bi&s;hops.  <GAP DESC="blank">  Add to this,</P>
<P N="5">(5.) THE Church is requir'd to love them <HI>in the high|e&s;t Degree,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. The Word carries an Empha&s;is, that can't well be expre&s;s'd in Engli&s;h. The &s;ame Phra&s;e is us'd in <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.20. and tran&s;lated <HI>Exceeding abundant|ly.</HI> So then They are required to <HI>abound,</HI> yea to <HI>&s;uper|abound,</HI> in the Expre&s;&s;ions of their E&s;teem &amp; Love to their Teachers; Which &s;urely cannot imply any thing le&s;s than the <HI>Double Honour,</HI> demanded in our Text. As then it mu&s;t needs re&s;ult, that the Elders in <HI>both</HI> Texts are of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Species, and mean <HI>Congregational</HI> Bi&s;hops: So like|wi&s;e the Con&s;equence is clear to a Demon&s;tration, that there are <HI>no other</HI> Bi&s;hops of a <HI>&s;uperior</HI> Rank; ina&s;much as the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Honours and Re&s;pects of the Church are by an expre&s;s Apo&s;tolic Decree (and by my Animad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erter's own implicit Conce&s;&s;ion) due unto <HI>that</HI> &s;ort of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;hops.</P>
<P>THUS, I have re&s;cu'd my la&s;t Text out of our Oppo|nent's hands; and made it appear, that by allowing 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.12. to be a <HI>good Comment</HI> upon it, he has pu&s;h'd hard at his own Brea&s;t, and given him&s;elf a mortal Wound,
<PB N="59" REF="002636_0061_0FE5D7E9007445A0">
while he thought of nothing but a fatal Thru&s;t at <HI>me.</HI> O amazing, dreadful Mi&s;take! While he dreamt of ca&s;t|ing up a mighty <HI>Trench</HI> for his Security, in the Defen&s;e of an expiring Cau&s;e, he was really digging a profound <HI>Grave,</HI> to bury it in. And now he will &s;urely pardon me, if I have been, doing a faithful Part, to ea&s;e his Task, and facilitate the Funeral. &mdash; However, I know (my Friend) that <HI>you</HI> will put the kinde&s;t Meaning upon any good Offices I may have done to that End.  <GAP DESC="blank">  To conclude,</P>
<P>I think I have now di&s;&s;ipated all the Exceptions, that our An&s;werer has brought again&s;t my <HI>Appendix;</HI> and ful|ly vindicated as many of my Arguments, as he was pleas'd to attack. I'm &s;en&s;ible I have been too diffu&s;ive on &s;eve|ral heads, and in general transgre&s;s'd the Rules of Propor|tion; but hope I've every where kept within the Bounds of <HI>Truth</HI> &amp; <HI>Soberne&s;s.</HI> I tru&s;t I have not broken over the Laws of fair Di&s;putation, nor made a forfeiture of the <HI>Gentle|manly</HI> Treatment, with which my Animadverter has be|gun to di&s;tingui&s;h me. I may ju&s;tly therefore expect, if he &s;ees fit to reply, that he will return me the <HI>&s;ame Mea&s;ure:</HI> And if he advances any thing <HI>new,</HI> I &s;hall (if I have Op|portunity) give him my Thoughts upon it. But if he on|ly repeats the old Story, or <HI>falls from &s;olid Rea&s;oning</HI> (to u&s;e an Expre&s;&s;ion of his own) I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Enough</HI> is already &s;aid on both &s;ides, and &s;hall hardly think it worth while to write a third time. For I am not at all fond of giving the <HI>la&s;t Word.</HI></P>
<P>PARDON me now (my Friend) this long Interruption, and let me once more feel the Influences of that Goodne&s;s and Candour, which endears you to all your Acquaintants, tho' to none more than</P>
