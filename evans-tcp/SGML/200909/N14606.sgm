<HEAD>REASONS FOR QUITTING The Methodi&s;t Society, IN ANWER TO A Printed Letter, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MY friend's letter needs no apology. And as it is an apo&s;tolic injunction, <HI>Be ready always to give an an&s;wer to every man that a&s;keth you a rea&s;on of the hope that is in you,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii. 15.</NOTE> I wi&s;h to do it, <HI>with meekne&s;s and fear.</HI></P>
<Q><P>It is a&s;ked, What are your rea&s;ons for quitting the Methodi&s;t connection?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As I have been repeatedly called upon by a number of per&s;ons in different parts of the kingdom, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to give one gene|ral an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions, which I hope may not only prove acceptable, but al&s;o beneficial to my friends.
My principal inducement therefore, in the publication of this let|ter, and my apology for troubling the public with it, are, that I think I owe it as a duty to my friends to my&s;elf, and above all, that truth requires it.</NOTE></P>
<P>And, Have you read a let|ter to a per&s;on joined with the people called Quakers?</P></Q>
<P>To the fir&s;t que&s;tion, I reply, I had many rea&s;ons, which will &s;ufficiently appear in my an&s;wer to the &s;e|cond query: And therefore, as I intend no reflection on a religious Society, many of whom I much e&s;teem, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve in general on this head, that hav|ing about a year &s;ince met with Barclay's Apology,
<PB N="4" REF="018525_0003_0FA7AD3F58E2C210">I was fully convinced, that the principles, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline of the people called Quakers,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The purity and Go&s;pel &s;implicity of their principles, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, I found my heart united to, before I was acquainted with any of that religious &s;ociety; and concluded, that if they, as a people, walked agreeably thereto, they were <HI>burning and &s;hining lights.</HI></NOTE> were more con&s;onant to &s;cripture, rea&s;on, and to my own feelings, than tho&s;e of the Society to which I was united. In|deed, I then &s;aw the cau&s;e of the many painful feel|ings, with which I had been for years exerci&s;ed, as ma|ny of my &s;entiments coincided with theirs, though I knew it not, being carried away with the vulgar opinion of the erroneou&s;ne&s;s of their principles, &amp;c. And as I believe, this is the &s;tate of many well-di&s;po&s;ed minds; I wi&s;h that people of all denominations would not take things upon tru&s;t, or on the authority of any man, or men; but &s;imply turn their minds to the Divine Teach|er, in their own brea&s;t, even to the Lord Je&s;us, who is <HI>the Life and Light of Men,</HI> as well as con&s;tantly <HI>&s;earch the Scriptures;</HI> for I am per&s;uaded, that numbers &s;o im|plicity believe all they hear, that it may be &s;aid they have no creed of their own,</P>
<P>To the &s;econd que&s;tion, I an&s;wer, I have repeatedly, and carefully peru&s;ed that letter, and &s;hall give my friend a few free remarks thereon.</P>
<P>But it may be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, that on the fir&s;t &s;uperficial view, it &s;truck me as &s;omething plau&s;ible; and I believe it has had the &s;ame effect on a certain cla&s;s of readers, who either cannot, or will not look beyond the &s;urface of things. This may account for its being deemed unan&s;werable. But looking into it a &s;econd and third time, it became le&s;s and le&s;s formida|ble; for as I more attentively con&s;idered the objections, and di&s;covered the fallacy of the arguments, &s;ome difficulties, which re&s;ted on my mind, were removed: On a clo&s;e in&s;pection, it appeared, that eight out of fifteen of Barclay's propo&s;itions, were granted to be agreeable to &s;cripture; and the&s;e eight propo&s;itions,
<PB N="5" REF="018525_0004_0FA7AD3FFAEE0770">which the objector allows, do not 'differ from Chri&s;ti|anity,' contain the fundamental doctrines of the Go&s;|pel. More narrowly looking into tho&s;e to which he has objected, I found rea&s;on to conclude, that he now &s;ees things more clearly, and has therefore changed his mind with regard to the &s;eventh propo&s;ition on Ju&s;tification, and the tenth on Women's preaching. My rea&s;ons, I expect, will be &s;ufficiently clear, when they &s;hall be given in their proper place.</P>
<P>As to the fifteenth propo&s;ition, re&s;pecting <HI>conformity to the world,</HI> he agrees with Barclay in &s;ome things; and how he can prove that his denying flattering titles to be given to men, makes <Q>a difference between Qua|keri&s;m and Chri&s;tianity,</Q> is a my&s;tery indeed. How|ever, this I am certain of, that if Barclay was mi&s;ta|ken in &s;ome particulars objected to, his mi&s;takes are harmle&s;s, being on the &s;afe &s;ide, and &s;uch as do not hinder tho&s;e who hold them, according to the objector's own words, from being <Q>Real Chri&s;tians; men who have the mind that was in Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The objector's words are always enclo&s;ed in &s;ingle inverted commas.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>I conclude therefore, that eleven out of the fifteen propo&s;itions, have nothing different from Chri&s;tianity in them. Let us then calmly con&s;ider the reprobated ones, weighing the arguments which are brought to prove that they 'manife&s;tly differ from Chri&s;tianity;' and in doing this, let us follow the objector &s;tep by &s;tep, entering more minutely into the particulars we have ju&s;t glanced over.</P>
<P N="1">The fir&s;t objection, [P. 4.] is again&s;t the latter part of Barclay's &s;econd propo&s;ition, in which he treats of immediate revelation. The &s;entence objected to is this, <Q>Yet the&s;e revelations are not to be &s;ubjected to the examinations of the &s;criptures as a touch&s;tone.</Q></P>
<P>To which the writer of that letter replies <Q>Here there is a difference between Quakeri&s;m and Chri&s;tianity.
<PB N="6" REF="018525_0005_0FA7AD40B58A5838">The Scriptures are the touch&s;tone, whereby Chri&s;|tians examine all [real or &s;uppo&s;ed] revelations, In all ca&s;es they appeal to the law, and to the te&s;timony, and try every Spirit thereby.</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer. Whatever <Q>manife&s;t difference between Quakeri&s;m and Chri&s;tianity,</Q> &s;ome people may &s;ee in Barclay's Apology, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, there is a mani|fe&s;t injury done him, by a mutilated quotation, which quite alters the &s;en&s;e of that pa&s;&s;age, and makes him &s;peak a language, which both he and his friends di&s;a|vow.</P>
<P>He is here repre&s;ented as delivering and con&s;equently the people called Quakers as holding a tenet, which mu&s;t fix a &s;tigma on them, as tho' they &s;lighted the Scriptures, and refu&s;ed to have their doctrines and practices tried by them. I will give Barclay's own words, and then my friend may judge how fairly he has been quoted, and whether there is ju&s;t ground to charge him with under-rating the &s;criptures. His words are, <Q>Yet from hence it will not follow, That the&s;e revelations are to be &s;ubjected to the examination, <HI>either of the outward</HI> te&s;timony of the Scriptures, <HI>or of the natural rea&s;on of man, as to a more noble or certain touch&s;tone.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Was it de&s;igned, or only an over&s;ight, to leave out almo&s;t half the &s;entence, e&s;pecially the words <HI>"more noble or certain?"</HI> If it was <HI>only</HI> an over&s;ight, it is highly blameable; for the omi&s;&s;ion alters the &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age. It is very obvious, Barclay's meaning is, that however excellent the &s;criptures are, yet they mu&s;t be con&s;idered as inferior to the Holy Spirit, by which they were dictated. And he is particularly careful, while he contends for the doctrine of in&s;pira|tion, to guard again&s;t the abu&s;e of it, by &s;aying, <Q>The&s;e divine, inward revelations, neither do, nor even can contradict the outward letter of &s;cripture, or right and &s;ound rea&s;on.</Q> And as this &s;entnece was not
<PB N="7" REF="018525_0006_0FA7AD41727FEAE0">only joined with, but preci&s;ely fixes the &s;en&s;e of that objected to, I marvel that it could be overlooked.</P>
<P N="2">2. I am far from being &s;atisfied with what is brought as a proof of Barclay's error. The objector &s;ays, <Q>In all ca&s;es they appeal to the law and to the te&s;timony.</Q></P>
<P>I could not help applying to this way of proving things, what a witty author &s;ays, <Q>Clergymen generally &s;et out with begging the que&s;tion.</Q> This is exactly the ca&s;e, in taking for granted, that the <HI>law and the Te&s;timony</HI> always mean the letter of &s;cripture. No &s;ure|ly; for the &s;criptures &s;peak of <HI>the law written in the heart,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Room. ii. 15.</NOTE> informing us of <HI>its accu&s;ing, or el&s;e excu&s;ing;</HI> they very frequently treat of <HI>the law of the Spirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>the word of God</HI> and &s;ure <HI>te&s;timony,</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xix. 10, 13.</NOTE> te&s;tifying of him, that he is the inward <HI>life and light of men.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John i. 4.</NOTE> <HI>The true light</HI> to the poor Gentile world, who are not &s;o highly favoured as we are with the letter of &s;cripture: <HI>The true light</HI> to the poor Papi&s;ts, who, by de&s;igning men, are forbid the u&s;e of them: And <HI>the true light</HI> to multitudes, who through bodily infirmi|ties, &amp;c. are deprived of the outward te&s;timony of &s;cripture. Yet all the&s;e have <HI>the Law written in their hearts;</HI> Je&s;us being that glorious, univer&s;al, &s;aving <HI>light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the World.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John i. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. I think it mu&s;t clearly appear, to every enlight|ened, unprejudiced mind, that in this article, R. Barclay is far &s;ounder in the Chri&s;tian faith, than the objector. For the latter, in affirming, 'The &s;crip|tures 'are the touch&s;tone, whereby all Chri&s;tians exa|mine <HI>all</HI> revelations,' &s;eems to me to renounce this glorious Go&s;pel promi&s;e and privilege, <HI>When the Spi|rit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 13.</NOTE> That they are a touch&s;tone, is fully &s;ub&s;cribed to, but that they are the <HI>only</HI> touch&s;tone, is denied, as it de|rogates from the office of the Holy Spirit, which is not only given to, but is <HI>to abide</HI> with the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, <HI>to the end of the world.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxviii. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="8" REF="018525_0007_0FA7AD4242FED0B0">
4. That 'the Scriptures are' <HI>not</HI> <Q>the touch&s;tone to examine all revelations,</Q> I prove thus.</P>
<P>Holy men of old, who <HI>walked with God,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. v. 22.</NOTE> were fre|quently favoured with immediate revelations; yet the&s;e men had not the letter of &s;cripture: And if <Q>the &s;crip|tures are the touch&s;tone to examine all (real or &s;up|po&s;ed) revelations,</Q> I &s;hould be glad to know, as they were de&s;titute of this touch&s;tone, how they di&s;tingui&s;h|ed the one from the other? I take it for granted, that they had the &s;ame Holy Spirit, which Barclay pleads for as the peculiar privilege of Chri&s;tians, it being promi&s;ed under the Go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, <HI>They &s;hall be all taught of God.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John vi. 45.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">5. That <Q>The &s;criptures are the touch&s;tone to exa|mine all revelations,</Q> cannot be true, for they de|clare in&s;tances, wherein they could be no touch&s;tone at all.</P>
<P>Philip had a revelation to join him&s;elf to the Ethio|pian, who was reading in his chariot.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts viii. 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>Paul and Timothy had a revelation not to preach <HI>the word</HI> (at that time) <HI>in A&s;ia,</HI> being <HI>forbidden of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 6.</NOTE> They had a &s;econd revelation not to go <HI>to Bythinia, the &s;pirit not &s;uffering them.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> In &s;hort, (to pa&s;s by many in&s;tances of this kind) they had a third revelation to go to Macedonia<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 10.</NOTE> But if <Q>the &s;criptures are the touch&s;tone to examine all revelations,</Q> what &s;cripture could they turn to, capable of &s;atisfy|ing them in any of the&s;e particulars?</P>
<P N="6">6. We may bring the matter nearer to our&s;elves. There is a variety of ca&s;es, which we may be called to act in, re&s;pecting which, although we may earne&s;t|ly de&s;ire to know the will of God, the &s;criptures may be quite &s;ilent. Let me &s;elect a &s;ingle in&s;tance, that of the Mini&s;try. Pray what Scripture can &s;atisfy a man,
<PB N="9" REF="018525_0008_0FA7AD42EFDE5D30">"That he is inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When any per&s;on offers him&s;elf to the Bi&s;hop, to be a Mi|ni&s;ter of the Church of England, he a&s;ks him, <Q>Do you Believe that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t to this office?</Q> He an&s;wers, "I tru&s;t I am." Were this really the ca&s;e with all who are &s;tyled Mini&s;ters, we might rea&s;onably expect to &s;ee a &s;peedy and happy change take place among&s;t men.</NOTE> to that important office? It will not do to &s;ay he has gifts; for I pre&s;ume, that many have gifts, [if by gifts we under&s;tand man's natural and acquired abilities,] who are not called to that important work. And the que&s;tion is not re&s;pecting qualifications, but &s;ingly this, whether any &s;cripture can fully &s;atisfy a man thus exer|ci&s;ed, that what he feels in his mind, is a 'real, and not a &s;uppo&s;ed revelation?'</P>
<P>There is &s;omething that looks like an objection to the third propo&s;ition, which, I confe&s;s, gives the ob|jector the appearance of one di&s;po&s;ed to find fault. However, he an&s;wers his own objection, when he &s;ays, <Q>If by the&s;e words be only meant, that <HI>the &s;pirit</HI> is our fir&s;t and principal leader. Here is no differ|ence between Quakeri&s;m and Chri&s;tianity!</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;k how is it po&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand Barclay in any other &s;en&s;e? And, is it not &s;urprizing that the objector &s;hould bring in an <HI>if,</HI> and &s;eem at a lo&s;s for his mean|ing, when in the &s;ame &s;entence, he quotes Barclay's words? "The &s;pirit is our fir&s;t and principal leader." I wi&s;h therefore, that in&s;tead of playing upon words, he had given a nece&s;&s;ary caution again&s;t a common, but dangerous error, among&s;t tho&s;e called &s;piritual people, of making the &s;criptures &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of the holy &s;pirit, which our divine Ma&s;ter promi&s;ed to all his followers, when he &s;aid, <HI>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Gho&s;t, whom the Father will &s;end in my name, he &s;hall teach you all things.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xiv <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">.</NOTE> And which ex|actly corre&s;ponds with what the beloved di&s;ciple John te&s;tifies to have been experienced by tho&s;e, whom he
<PB N="10" REF="018525_0009_0FA7AD43EB6AF5B0">addre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e ever memorable words, <HI>Ye have an unction from the holy One; and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the &s;ame anointing teacheth you of all things.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 10.17.</NOTE> A glorious and comfortable truth! which, when experimentally known, will lead to the highe&s;t e&s;timation of the &s;criptures, as they not only te&s;tify of the great love of Chri&s;t, in what he has done and &s;uffered for &s;inners, but al&s;o as they give a true te&s;|timony of his redeeming power, which the&s;e have witne&s;&s;ed in their own hearts. And without this liv|ing knowledge of the heart, however men may idolize the &s;cripture, it is to them a <HI>&s;ealed book,</HI> and a dead letter; which is &s;trikingly &s;et forth in the&s;e words, <HI>The letter killeth, but the &s;pirit giveth life.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on this &s;ubject, on account of its great importance, and becau&s;e numbers of pro|fe&s;&s;ors, are not only ignorant of it as an experimental truth, but &s;trangers to it even in theory. And I am con&s;trained to &s;ay, I know not any religious &s;ociety, except the people called Quakers, that bears a &s;criptu|ral te&s;timony to the doctrine of immediate divine in&s;piration. It is true, the e&s;tabli&s;hed church daily prays for, and others preach, and talk much about it; but when they come to the point, &s;ome laugh at all who make preten&s;ions of this kind, and others charge them with manife&s;tly differing from Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>The third objection is brought again&s;t the &s;eventh propo&s;ition, which treats on ju&s;tification, of which the objector &s;ays, <Q>Here is a wide difference between Quakeri&s;m and Chri&s;tianity.</Q> <Q>This is flat ju&s;tifica|tion by works.</Q> And adds, <Q>The ground of this mi&s;take, is the not under&s;tanding the meaning of the word ju&s;tification.</Q></P>
<P>To which I reply,</P>
<P N="1">1. That Barclay u&s;es the word in a &s;ound, proper &s;en&s;e, for, being made ju&s;t; which implies the remi&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="11" REF="018525_0010_0FA7AD458B162A50">of &s;ins, as well as the renewal of the mind, and as the&s;e cannot be &s;eparated in the experience of Chri&s;|tians, they are always connected in the &s;criptures. The Apo&s;tle Paul, &s;peaking of the wonderful change wrought on &s;ome per&s;ons of the mo&s;t abandoned cha|racters, &s;ays, <HI>And &s;uch were &s;ome of you: but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;anctified, but ye are ju&s;tified in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the &s;pirit of our God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Cor. vi. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>And it is worthy to be remarked, that the term ju&s;tification is mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed for being made ju&s;t, as in the&s;e words, <HI>For he that is dead, is freed</HI> (Gr. ju&s;tified) <HI>from &s;in.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 7.</NOTE> I apprehend the rea&s;on why it is &s;o frequently u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e in &s;cripture, as well as by Barclay, is becau&s;e it is le&s;s liable to be abu&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">2. The mi&s;taken &s;en&s;e in which &s;ome under&s;tand the term ju&s;tification, as implying an imputation of righteou&s;ne&s;s, without the implantation thereof, ari&s;es from the ab&s;urd idea which men form of the &s;upreme Maje&s;ty; gloomy minds repre&s;enting to them&s;elves, and &s;etting him forth to others, as an implacable Being, full of vindictive wrath, even again&s;t &s;uch as have not only been convinced of, but earne&s;tly de&s;ire to for|&s;ake the evil of their ways. So that for want of ju&s;t conceptions of the divine Being, and properly advert|ing to what the &s;criptures uniformly declare, <HI>God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have ever|la&s;ting life;</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John iii. 16.</NOTE> and not clearly under&s;tanding that Chri&s;t's coming into the world was not the cau&s;e, but the effect of God's great love to all men, our gracious Creator is &s;et forth in an unamiable light, &s;tript of his divine perfections; and on this fal&s;e foundation, a &s;uper&s;truc|ture rai&s;ed, which, I think, is &s;ubver&s;ive of holine&s;s, in heart and life.</P>
<P N="3">3. But I mu&s;t do ju&s;tice to the objector, by &s;aying, he has publicly confe&s;&s;ed, that he formerly leaned too
<PB N="12" REF="018525_0011_0FA7AD466DCE70C0">much to Calvini&s;m, with re&s;pect to the doctrine of ju&s;tification, and has therefore openly a&s;&s;erted, <Q>We are every moment plea&s;ing or di&s;plea&s;ing to God, according to the whole of our inward tempers, and outward conduct.</Q></P>
<P>If I mi&s;take not, this exactly coincides with Barclay, and is agreeable to <HI>&s;ound doctrine,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 3.</NOTE> as well as to the divine te&s;timony, which every man has in his own brea&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. As there is a common, but very unju&s;t charge brought again&s;t the people called Quakers, by &s;ome who are ignorant of, as well as by others, who, I fear, de&s;ignedly mi&s;repre&s;ent their principles, <Q>That they deny the fall of man, and err in the nature and cau&s;e of our ju&s;tification;</Q> this &s;eems to be a proper place to clear up the&s;e points, which I &s;hall attempt to do, by making an extract from Barclay's Apology, hoping it will fully &s;atisfy every unprejudiced mind, re&s;pecting the&s;e important &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>We con&s;ider then, our redemption in a twofold re&s;pect, both which in their own nature are perfect, though in their application the one is not, nor can be, without re&s;pect to the other.</P>

The fir&s;t is the redemption performed by Chri&s;t, in his crucified body without us: the other is the redemption wrought by Chri&s;t within us; which no le&s;s properly is accounted redemption than the former.

<P>The &s;econd is that, whereby we witne&s;s his pure and perfect redemption in our&s;elves, purifying and redeeming us from the power of corruption, and bringing us into unity, favor, and friend&s;hip with God.

<P>Hence may clearly appear what a manife&s;t mi&s;re|pre&s;entation it is, to charge the people called Quakers

<P>The fourth objection to the tenth propo&s;ition, which treats of the mini&s;try is, that in &s;uffering women to preach, 'There is a manife&s;t difference between Qua|keri&s;m and Chri&s;tianity.' And to &s;upport this charge, there are two texts of &s;cripture produced, which are the only ones that <HI>&s;eem</HI> to &s;erve the purpo&s;e; but that they are not u&s;ed in their true &s;ignification, I hope fully to demon&s;trate. For</P>
<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t, that the &s;ilence which the Apo&s;tle enjoins, is, <HI>not a&s;king que&s;tions in the church,</HI> is evident from a great variety of particulars, as well as from the context. Plea&s;e to read the chapter, and mark the connection. The Apo&s;tle had been treating of the gift of tongues, and of per&s;ons prophe&s;ying one after another. There is rea&s;on to conclude, that in the&s;e public a&s;&s;emblies, there were people of different nations, as was the ca&s;e on the day of Penteco&s;t, and that one Mini&s;ter had the gift of one tongue, and a &s;econd of another, in the &s;ame diver&s;ity, that they had the other miraculous gifts. For, that they all had not an univer&s;al knowledge of all languages, is clear from the Apo&s;tle Paul's words, <HI>I &s;peak with tongues more than you all.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 18</NOTE> How rea&s;on|able then is this conclu&s;ion, that there were a few inqui|&s;itive women in the a&s;&s;embly, who, not under&s;tanding what the preacher was then delivering, but prompted by curio&s;ity, [perhaps from a better motive] might have a&s;k|ed que&s;tions, to the interruption of the &s;peaker and au|ditory? Therofore the Apo&s;tle gives this admonition, <HI>Let your women</HI> [Gr. wives] <HI>keep &s;ilence, and if they will learn any thing, let them a&s;k their hu&s;bands at home, for it is a &s;hame for them to &s;peak</HI> [that is to a&s;k que&s;tions] <HI>in the church.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ver&s;e 34, 35.</NOTE> The injunction, for <HI>wives to a&s;k their hu&s;bands at home,</HI> clearly &s;hews that the prohibition was

It &s;eems a reflection on an in&s;pired writer, to &s;uppo&s;e he wrote &s;o inconclu|&s;ively. I think, therefore, that the expo&s;ition I have given, is ea&s;y and natural, does no violence to any part of the pa&s;&s;age, and prevents one &s;cripture from mili|tating again&s;t another.</P>
<P N="2">2. If this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the publication of the fir&s;t edition,</NOTE> I have &s;een the judi|cious J. Locke's paraphra&s;e on the Epi&s;tles, and was plea&s;ed to find, that he has given the &s;ame expo&s;ition on this pa&s;&s;age.</P>

<P N="3"><PB N="17" REF="018525_0016_0FA7AD49D8F0CBD0">
3. To the&s;e &s;triking, and I think unan&s;werable &s;crip|tures, the objector only propo&s;es a very harmle&s;s que&s;|tion. 'But how do you prove, that prophe&s;ying in any of the&s;e places means preaching?'</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, This is an ea&s;y way of getting free from difficulties; for, if I mi&s;take not, the proof lay at his own door; and before he drew the ha&s;ty conclu&s;ion, <Q>Here is a manife&s;t difference between Quakeri&s;m and Chri&s;tianity, he &s;hould have proved that prophe&s;ying in any of the&s;e places <HI>does not</HI> mean preaching.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. But as the whole is re&s;ted on this &s;ingle point, I &s;hall attempt to prove, that prophe&s;ying generally means preaching, and that in tho&s;e places we are more parti|cularly concerned in, it has no other &s;ignification.</P>
<P>And, Fir&s;t, The apo&s;tle has joined praying and pro|phe&s;ying together; and as praying in public a&s;&s;emblies, (for of &s;uch he was treating) is univer&s;ally allowed to be a part, and indeed a very principal part of the mini&s;terial office; and women did exerci&s;e this part of the mini&s;terial function, in being the mouth of the peo|ple to God; we have here, at lea&s;t, a pre&s;umptive proof, that prophe&s;ying means preaching; and, I think, a demon&s;tration, that the &s;peaking in the church, which the apo&s;tle reproves in women, mu&s;t be wholly confined to a&s;king que&s;tions; otherwi&s;e it would be a prohibition again&s;t their praying, as well as preaching. For how could women pray in public, if it were a &s;hame for them to &s;peak in the Church, in the &s;en&s;e wherein it is generally under&s;tood?</P>
<P>Secondly, The apo&s;tle when he u&s;es the word, preci&s;e|ly fixes the meaning thereof. <HI>He that prophe&s;ieth, &s;peak|eth unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. He that prophe&s;ieth, edifieth the church.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 3, 4.</NOTE> <HI>For ye may all prophe&s;y, one by one,</HI> (that is, all who were qualified for, and called to the mini&s;try) <HI>that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 31.</NOTE> <HI>All may learn</HI> from tho&s;e who pro|phe&s;ied;
<PB N="18" REF="018525_0017_0FA7AD4A81C932F8">and women did prophe&s;y; therefore women were <HI>teachers,</HI> by whom <HI>the church was exhorted, edified and comforted.</HI></P>
<P>In this common acceptation we frequently find the word <HI>prophecy</HI> u&s;ed in the Old and New Te&s;tament. <HI>Aaron thy brother &s;hall be thy prophet;</HI> that is <HI>&s;hall &s;peak unto Pharaoh.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. vii. 1, 2.</NOTE> Judas and Silas, being Prophets, <HI>ex|horted the brethren with many words.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts. xv. 32.</NOTE> <HI>Anna the pro|phete&s;s, coming into the temple, gave thanks unto the Lord, and &s;pake of him</HI> (Chri&s;t) <HI>to all them who looked for redemption in I&s;rael.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 38.</NOTE> <HI>Zachariah prophe&s;ied, &s;aying Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael, who hath vi&s;ited, and redeemed his people.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 67.</NOTE> In all the&s;e places, prophe&s;ying has no other meaning than preaching; and among the&s;e preachers, we have a female. And that there was nothing of an extraordinary nature in the prophe&s;ying, which the apo&s;tle treats of throughout the whole chap|ter we have been con&s;idering, may be learned from the clo&s;e of it; for the church was to judge of what was delivered. <HI>Let the prophets &s;peak, two or three; and let the others judge.</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thirdly, Should it be granted, that it does not mean preaching, it makes the ca&s;e wor&s;e; for then it mu&s;t have been &s;omething greater, as the apo&s;tle informs us: <HI>Greater is he that prophe&s;ieth, than he that &s;peaketh with tongues.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 5.</NOTE>And he exhorts them, <HI>De&s;ire &s;piritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophe&s;y.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 1.</NOTE> Hereby &s;igni|fying, that prophe&s;ying was above all the miraculous gifts, which abounded in that church. So that there is but this alternative, if they are not allowed to be ordi|nary, then we make them extraordinary mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons, when they have been clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, have &s;ought for refuge, by granting that the&s;e women, who prophe&s;ied, were called to an extraordinary work; which, I think, is giving up the whole point at once, as it grants more than is contended for. And hence
<PB N="19" REF="018525_0018_0FA7AD4B48677958">we may infer, according to the well e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, He that is called to a greater, may be called to an in|ferior work.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;hould it be granted, that prophe&s;ying means foretelling things to come, an in&s;urmountable difficulty yet remains; for, if it was unlawful for women, who had that gift, to &s;peak in the church, how were they to communicate what was revealed to them? If by &s;peaking, what could this be termed, but the mo&s;t ex|cellent preaching?</P>
<P>Fourthly, The &s;imple fact &s;eems to be this, that tho' prophe&s;ying &s;ometimes means predicting, or foretelling things to come, yet in the places which I have quoted, it only means preaching in the common acceptation of the word; and whenever it is u&s;ed in the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The much admired M. Henry, in his comment on Acts ii. 18.</NOTE> un|der&s;tands it in both the&s;e &s;en&s;es, and, I think, he is al&s;o full to the point, re&s;pecting the lawfulne&s;s of womens preaching.</P>
<P><Q>By the Spirit they &s;hall be enabled to foretel things to come, and to preach the Go&s;pel, without di&s;tinction of &s;ex, not only your &s;ons, but your daughters; without di&s;tinction of age, both your young men, and old men; and without di&s;tinction of outward condition, even the &s;ervants and handmaids &s;hall prophe&s;y.</Q></P>
<P>J. Locke, in his paraphra&s;e on the Chapter we are treating of, gives another &s;en&s;e in which the word Prophe&s;y is to be under&s;tood. <Q>When any one (&s;ays he) &s;ung to God, by the immediate motion, and impul&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t, which was one of the actions called prophe&s;ying, they &s;ung alone. And indeed how could it be other|wi&s;e? For who could join with a per&s;on &s;o prophe&s;ying in things dictated to him alone by the Holy Gho&s;t?</Q></P>
<P>Here we &s;ee the nature of &s;inging in the primitive Church. former &s;en&s;e, it always includes preaching, as publi&s;hing the&s;e predictions to tho&s;e concerned. Hence, under the law, &s;uch per&s;ons were &s;tiled Nebiaim, prophets, (from Ba, which &s;ignifies to come, and to go) becau&s;e of their coming and going between God and the people. So under the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, they are called Pro|phets, (from <HI>pro,</HI> and <HI>phemi,</HI> dico, I &s;peak, or utter forth) becau&s;e Mini&s;ters are the Lord's me&s;&s;engers, to publi&s;h his word of reconciliation to the people. <HI>He hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 19.</NOTE> is the
<PB N="20" REF="018525_0019_0FA7AD4BEDEDA8F0">language of an in&s;pired apo&s;tle; and therefore he adds, <HI>We pray you, in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye reconciled to God.</HI></P>
<P>The other &s;cripture, <HI>I &s;uffer not a woman to teach, or u&s;urp authority over the man,</HI> has no relation to public teaching, but to her private character, which is very evident from the context. In this &s;en&s;e J. Locke ex|plains it. Treating of 1 Cor. xi. 34. and 1 Tim. ii. 11. He &s;ays, <Q>What in the one is expre&s;&s;ed, by keeping &s;ilence; and not &s;peaking, but being under obedience, in the other is called, being in &s;ilence with all &s;ubjection, not teaching nor u&s;urping authority over the man. I apply the prohibition of &s;peaking only to rea&s;oning and purely voluntary di&s;cour&s;e, but &s;uppo&s;e a liberty left women to &s;peak, where they had an immediate revelation and impul&s;e from the Spirit of God.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. I might have taken a &s;horter method to convince &s;ome per&s;ons, that there is nothing unlawful in women's preaching, by &s;aying, there are &s;everal female teachers in the Methodi&s;t &s;ociety; and hence I concluded, in the beginning of this letter, that the objector has chan|ged his &s;entiments in this particular. If he has not, there &s;eems <HI>a manife&s;t</HI> incon&s;i&s;tency in his &s;uffering women to preach.</P>
<P>The eleventh propo&s;ition treats of religious Wor&s;hip, of which Barclay &s;ays, <Q>All true wor&s;hip to God is offered in the inward and immediate moving of his own Spirit, and all wor&s;hip, which man &s;ets about in his <HI>own</HI> will, is will-wor&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P N="1">1. It is well worthy my friend's particular notice, that altho' the writer of that letter objects to, yet he grants the whole of this propo&s;ition, when, adopting Barclay's words, he &s;ays, 'It is true indeed,' <Q>That all true wor&s;hip to God is offered in the inward and immediate moving of his own Spirit,</Q> <Q>and that we cannot truly wor&s;hip God, unle&s;s his Spirit move or incline our hearts.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="018525_0020_0FA7AD4EF4413668">
If &s;o, the di&s;pute is at an end; as all that Barclay contended for, is granted.</P>
<P>The objector's de&s;inition of in&s;piration is this. <Q>God moves man, whom he has made a rea&s;onable creature, according to the rea&s;on he has given him, He moves him by his under&s;tanding, as well as his affections, by light, as well as by heat. He moves him to do this or that by conviction, full as often as by de&s;ire. And he does truly move you to preach, when in his light you &s;ee light, clearly &s;atisfying you it is his will.</Q></P>
<P>I reply, Let the Holy Spirit move the heart in what manner he is plea&s;ed; for, I believe, that when the 'af|fections' are divinely moved, &s;o is the 'under&s;tanding;' and when there is divine 'heat,' 'light' and 'convic|tion,' are its in&s;eparable attendants. But this moving of the Spirit on the minds of men mu&s;t be con&s;idered, as &s;omething which we have not at our own command, but is di&s;tinct from, and very &s;uperior to, the mere exerci&s;e of the rational faculties. This di&s;tinction, I think, the objector has not &s;ufficiently attended to, or he would not have given us, what appears to me, an il|lu&s;tration of the &s;ubject, which explains away the very nature of in&s;piration. He &s;ays, <Q>You are as really moved by the Spirit, when God convinces you, you ought to feed him that is hungry, as when he gives you ever &s;o &s;trong a de&s;ire, impul&s;e, or inclination.</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, If this a&s;&s;ertion is confined to the action of feeding the hungry, or to any other civil or relative duty, it is an undoubted truth. But if it is intended to illu&s;trate the doctrine of in&s;piration, I object to it as very foreign to that &s;ubject, as it confounds things of a very di&s;&s;imilar nature. The fallacy of this way of rea|&s;oning lies, in taking for granted, that they are &s;imilar ca&s;es, and con&s;equently, that there is no more need of divine in&s;piration, to qualify us to wor&s;hip the divine Maje&s;ty, or preach the Go&s;pel, than to feed the hungry; the rever&s;e of which appears to be the truth; for I know it to be my duty at all times to a&s;&s;i&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; nor

<P>But how does this agree with his a&s;&s;ertion, <Q>God truly does move you to preach, when in his light you &s;ee light, clearly &s;atisfying you it is his will?</Q> Has Barclay &s;aid any thing &s;tronger on the &s;ubject?

And this, I believe, (for I &s;peak from expe|rience) mu&s;t frequently be the ca&s;e with well-meaning men, who &s;it or unfit, are in the practice of preaching at certain &s;tated times. I fear there are others, who are &s;trangers to, feel no want of, and therefore do not wait for the divine aid, to qualify them for this great work.

I an&s;wer, This is merely begging the que&s;tion.

But &s;hould it be granted (which I mu&s;t deny) that <Q>there is neither command nor example for it in &s;cripture;</Q> yet unhappily this proves too much, and may be retorted with greater &s;ucce&s;s, that there is neither command nor example,' under the Go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, for <HI>liturgies, &s;inging men, organs,</HI> and all tho&s;e &s;uperfluous ornaments, which have been borrowed from the Church of Rome, and are diame|trically oppo&s;ite to the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, being the inventions of men, and introduced into the Church in the times of apo&s;tacy, to &s;upply the want of the divine pre&s;ence. We may therefore &s;afely conclude, <Q>This is will-wor&s;hip, if there be any &s;uch thing under heaven;</Q> for there is neither command nor example for it in &s;cripture; nor did it take place in any Chri&s;|tian a&s;&s;embly, till the inward <HI>glory</HI> had, in &s;ome degree <HI>departed</HI> from it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. iv. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. All the objections, that are brought again&s;t this &s;ilent waiting on the Lord, ari&s;e from not rightly con&s;i|dering the true nature of religious wor&s;hip; which may be ju&s;tly defined, a &s;imple act of the mind; and all ex|ternal acts, are at be&s;t, only &s;o many outward expre&s;&s;ions thereof.</P>
<P>If this be granted, which, I think, is &s;elf-evident, it will follow, that as there may be external acts of devo|tion, which do not ari&s;e from the internal actings of the quickened foul, &s;o, on the contrary, the mind may be reverently exerci&s;ed in divine wor&s;hip, when there are not any verbal expre&s;&s;ions. Thus our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter defines the nature of all true wor&s;hip: <HI>God is a &s;pirit; and they that wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John iv. 24.</NOTE> It therefore highly concerns all, who de&s;ire to wor&s;hip the divine Being acceptably, to beware of

If we are de&s;titute of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, how|ever &s;pecious our performances may appear, and how|ever frequent we may be in the u&s;e of them, we &s;hall only re&s;emble the carnal Jews, who fancied, that reli|gion con&s;i&s;ted in the &s;plendor of their temple, and out|ward acts of devotion, while they neglected to cultivate that rectitude of mind, which renders our offerings acceptable in the &s;ight of the divine Being.</P>
<P N="4">4. From what has been &s;aid, I think it is evident, that the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ilent waiting upon the Lord has its foundation in the nature and fitne&s;s of things. For, as it is the <HI>Holy Spirit which helps our infirmi|ties;</HI> and <HI>we know not what to pray for as we ought,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 26.</NOTE> till we are thus a&s;&s;i&s;ted; it follows, that <Q>we cannot truly wor&s;hip God, unle&s;s his Spirit move and incline our hearts;</Q> a &s;ilent waiting therefore, for the moving of the Holy Spirit is not only rea&s;onable, but our indi&s;|pen&s;able duty; and the not waiting for this divine a&s;&s;i&s;|tance, before we begin, any act of religious wor&s;hip, is no le&s;s ab&s;urd, than it would have been for a di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on, at the <HI>pool of Bethe&s;da,</HI> to have &s;tepped into the water before the <HI>angel came down to trouble it.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John v. 4.</NOTE> So that were the &s;criptures perfectly &s;ilent on this head, the na|ture of the duty fully evinces its expediency. And I may &s;afely add, that all tho&s;e, who are unacquainted with that reverential awe, which expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf in the &s;ilent breathings of the &s;oul, in humble gratitude, to the Author of our being; and is what the &s;cripture emphatically &s;tyles, <HI>pouring out the &s;oul before the Lord,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. i. 15.</NOTE> are but outward-court wor&s;hippers, who have not yet entered into <HI>the holy of holies.</HI></P>

4. All that the objector hath urged, re&s;pecting the lawfulne&s;s of appointing times and places for public wor&s;hip, falls to the ground, and only proves that he has mi&s;taken Barclay's meaning in the&s;e particulars; for the uniform practice of the people called Quakers, from the beginning, hath fully te&s;tified, that they con|&s;ider it as a duty to appoint times and places for their religious a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Many per&s;ons al&s;o greatly mi&s;apprehend Barclay, in &s;uppo&s;ing, that he pleads for entirely &s;ilent meetings, when he only pleads for a retired waiting for the divine aid, which alone qualifies to pray or preach.</P>

<P>But in order to under&s;tand the true ground of the mini&s;try, let us look back and con&s;ider, on what foun|dation the fir&s;t mini&s;ters &s;tood.

<P>From the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture we may infer the following particulars.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That their di&s;cour&s;es were not premeditated; but they delivered to the people what was immediately

The objector has wrote again&s;t conforming to the world in dre&s;s, and pointed out the danger of an imitation in the lowe&s;t de|gree, &s;aying, <Q>A ruffle, from one, may grow to twelve inches.</Q> Now &s;hould any per&s;on &s;ingle out this &s;en|tence, taking no notice of its connection, but in a kind of triumph, exclaim, Where do the &s;criptures forbid wearing a ruffle? <Q>The placing religion in &s;uch things
<PB N="41" REF="018525_0040_0FA7AC10A8011E90">as the&s;e, is &s;uch egregious tri&s;ling, as naturally tends to make religion &s;tink in the no&s;trils of In&s;idels and Heathens.</Q> Were any per&s;on thus to expo&s;e this well-de&s;igned caution to contempt, every fair rea&s;oner would condemn &s;uch a procedure.</P>
<P>And yet this very thing the objector is guilty of. Barclay has proved to a demon&s;tration, the apo&s;tacy of the Chri&s;tian world; and, among other things, that its pre&s;ent language and cu&s;toms, are incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;implicity, truth, and purity of the Go&s;pel. The di&s;|pute therefore, is not about the &s;ingle pronoun <HI>thou,</HI> whether it is more &s;criptural and grammatical, to u&s;e it to a &s;ingle per&s;on than <HI>you,</HI> for this is very obvious to all, who are not blinded by cu&s;tom or prejudice. For, after all the torturing of invention, to make <HI>you</HI> to a &s;ingle per&s;on proper, it can never be done, as it de&s;troys the ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction between the &s;econd per&s;on &s;ingular and plural.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, <HI>you</HI> to a &s;ingle per&s;on, was evil in its origin, being invented to &s;latter the vanity of one of the Ro|man Emperors, by addre&s;&s;ing him in the plural num|ber, as if he was more than mortal.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o evil in its nature, as it is contrary to truth to u&s;e the plural number to one per&s;on.</P>
<P>And, it is a departure from that &s;criptural language, u&s;ed by God him&s;elf, and by all holy men; to a fal&s;e, flattering, heatheni&s;h language, invented by vile &s;yco|phants, to plea&s;e men of corrupt minds.</P>
<P>But as I hinted, altho' this is a part of the plain language, yet it &s;tands connected with &s;everal things of greater importance. Therefore the objector &s;hould not have pa&s;&s;ed them, but ought to have proved, if it could be done, that it is quite con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>&s;peaking the truth from the heart,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alms xv. 2.</NOTE> to call per&s;ons <Q>Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s;</Q> and to &s;ub&s;cribe our&s;elves, their <Q>humble

<P>To which it is objected, <Q>In this there is a difference between Quakeri&s;m and Chri&s;tianity.</Q> <Q>St. Paul gives the title of Mo&s;t Noble to the Roman Gover|nor.</Q></P>
<P>From this objection we may learn, that it is not only lawful to give the&s;e titles to men, but al&s;o, that it is very criminal to withhold them, if it makes us differ from Chri&s;tianity. This, I think, is a perfectly new di&s;covery; and what &s;ome would term, the oppo&s;ite extreme.</P>
<P>That Paul once gave the title of <HI>Mo&s;t Noble</HI> to Fe&s;tus, Barclay grants; but adds, <Q>He would not have called him &s;uch, if he had not been truly noble; and in|deed he was, in not giving way to the fury of the Jews again&s;t him.</Q></P>

If &s;eems to me, that the objector is guilty of two mi&s;takes here.

And the &s;econd error, is in a&s;&s;erting, that the &s;cripture &s;ays, <Q>That Fe&s;tus did give way to the fury of the Jews again&s;t him.</Q> I think, the &s;cripture &s;ays the very rever&s;e.

<P>That this corrupt language, and tho&s;e flattering ti|tles, are not "&s;uitable to the &s;implicity and dignity" of a Chri&s;tian, I can prove from a comment on the&s;e words,

<P><Q>Kuria (which our tran&s;lators have rendered Lady) is undoubtedly a proper name both here, and in ver&s;e 5th.

<P>Here are two things granted: Fir&s;t, a corruption of language; and, &s;econdly, that this corruption of lan|guage is incompatible with the "dignity and &s;implicity" of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another branch of the plain language con&s;i&s;ts in a te&s;timony again&s;t that &s;pirit of apo&s;tacy, in departing from the &s;imple, &s;criptural language, u&s;ed by God him|&s;elf, and by holy men in all ages, in calling months and days by tho&s;e proper names, which the Almighty gave them; and adopting in the place thereof, tho&s;e heathen|i&s;h, idolatrous names, which were given them in honor of their fal&s;e gods. This will clearly appear, by con&s;i|dering the origin of &s;ome of the months, and of all the days of the week, now commonly u&s;ed; and which may be &s;een by con&s;ulting Chambers's and John&s;on's dictionaries, from which I have mo&s;tly borrowed the following remarks, re&s;pecting the change of the names of months and days.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t month was by the Romans called Janua|ry, in honor of Janus, an idol with two faces, to whom the fir&s;t day of this month was dedicated by the hea|thems, with fea&s;tings, dancings, ma&s;querades, &amp;c. In oppo&s;ition to which, the Chri&s;tians ob&s;erved it as a day of fa&s;ting and humiliation.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="45" REF="018525_0044_0FA7AC13A80F43A8">
2. The &s;econd month, according to an ancient te&s;ti|mony, was called February, in honor of the Prince of the infernal regions. Pliny informs us, that the fir&s;t twelve days of this month were &s;pent in offering &s;acrifi|ces to the infernal powers (devils) to render them pro|pitious to their decea&s;ed friends: And as Pluto (the &s;uppo&s;ed prince of the infernal regions) was called Februus, in honor of him, this month was called Fe|bruary.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third month was by Romulus, one of the Roman Emperors, &s;tyled March, in honor of his pre|tended father Mars, feigned to be the god of war: He therefore commanded, that religious wor&s;hip &s;hould be paid him.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth month is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been called April, in honor of an imaginary godde&s;s, known by the name of Venus, who was wor&s;hipped by the Ro|mans, and to whom the mo&s;t abominable, wanton rites were paid.</P>
<P N="5">. The fifth month is thought by &s;ome to have been termed May, in honor of the &s;enators of Rome. By others it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been called &s;o, in honor of Maia, the mother of Mercury, one of the pretend|ed deities, whom the idolatrous Romans wor&s;hipped.</P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;ixth month was &s;tyled June, in honor of an heatheni&s;h godde&s;s named Juno.</P>
<P N="7">7. The &s;eventh month has taken its name July, from Julius Cae&s;ar, one of the Roman Emperors.</P>
<P N="8">8. The eighth month was called Augu&s;t, in honor of one of the Roman Emperors, who was &s;tyled Au|gu&s;tus. The title of Augu&s;tus (which &s;ignifies vener|able, &s;acred, magnificent) was fir&s;t given to Octavius, one of the Emperors, as expre&s;&s;ive of &s;omething divine and elevated in him, above the common pitch of man|kind; and from that time all the Roman Emperors were flattered with the title of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar; that is, <HI>Sa|cred, Magnificent</HI> King.</P>

9. September, October, November, and December, are the old numerical Latin names for the&s;e months, which were not changed. But it would be improper to u&s;e them now, tho' quite proper before the &s;tyle was altered.

<P>And as the idolatrous Romans made the&s;e changes in the names of &s;everal of the months, in honor of their Emperors, or fal&s;e gods; &s;o our Pagan ance&s;tors chang|ed the names of all the days of the week, calling them by the name of the idol, which they wor&s;hipped on that day. Hence</P>

<P>The third day of the week was termed Tue&s;day, in honor of an idol called Tui&s;co Mars, who was wor &s;hipped by that barbarous and idolatrous people on this day.</P>
<P>The fourth day of the week was &s;tyled Wedne&s;day, and dedicated to one of their idols called Woden, whom they wor&s;hipped on this day.</P>
<P>The fifth day of the week they named Thur&s;day, in honor of one of their idols called Thor, whom they wor&s;hipped on this day.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth day of the week they &s;tyled Friday; and this day was dedicated to, and called after one of their idols, named Freya.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh day of the week they &s;tyled Saturday, in honor of the planet Saturn, the &s;uppo&s;ed father of the heathen gods, to whom idolatrous wor&s;hip was paid on this day.</P>

<P>As the practice is not only highly irrational, but quite contrary to the peaceable and loving &s;pirit, which the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t recommends, we mu&s;t not expect that it gives any countenance to it; and yet the abet|tors of war think, they can prove its lawfulne&s;s, from John the Bapti&s;t's an&s;wer to the &s;oldiers. <HI>Do violence to no man, and be content with your wages.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke iii. 14.</NOTE> And our Lord's &s;aying to his di&s;ciples, <HI>Let him that has no &s;word, &s;ell his garment, and buy one.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xxii. 36.</NOTE></P>
<P>To the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;criptures, I an&s;wer, Let all &s;ol|diers take this advice, <HI>Do violence to no man,</HI> and I am bold to affirm, that there will be a final period to wars, for maiming and &s;hedding the blood of our fellow-mor|tals, and thereby &s;ending them (perhaps, unprepared) into an awful eternity, is the greate&s;t violence we can offer them.</P>
<P>Should it be granted, (which I am far from believ|ing) that John tolerated the u&s;e of war, yet this is not to the point, as he was a Jew; and it is allowed, that war and &s;wearing, were lawful for them, but prohibited
<PB N="52" REF="018525_0051_0FA7AC18E72F0180">by the Founder of Chri&s;tianity. And as the Go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation is far more excellent than John's, therefore our Lord a&s;&s;erted, that tho' he was the greate&s;t of all the Prophets, <HI>yet the lea&s;t in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Math. xi. 11.</NOTE> That is, the Go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation is eminently &s;uperior to his. John was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, that he bore this public te&s;timony. <HI>He mu&s;t increa&s;e, but I mu&s;t decrea&s;e;</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John iii. 30.</NOTE> which words undoubtedly referred to their different di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>That divorcement, wars, and &s;wearing, tho' allowed to the Jews, <HI>becau&s;e of the hardne&s;s of their hearts,</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Math. xix. 8.</NOTE> are unlawful for Chri&s;tians, is evident from the following &s;criptures, which are full to the point, and need no comment. <HI>It hath been &s;aid, Who&s;oever &s;hall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement. But I &s;ay unto you, that who&s;oever &s;hall put away his wife, &s;aving for the cau&s;e of fornication, cau&s;eth her to commit adultery: and who&s;oever &s;hall marry her that is devorced, committeth adultery.</HI> Again, <HI>Ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid by them of old time, Thou &s;halt not for&s;wear thy&s;elf. But I &s;ay unto you, Swear not at all, &amp;c. for what&s;oever is more than Yea, yea; Nay, nay,</HI> (yes, or no) <HI>cometh of evil. Ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I &s;ay unto you, that ye re&s;i&s;t not evil, but who&s;oever &s;hall &s;mite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other al&s;o.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Math. v. 31.</NOTE> And the Apo&s;tle James leads us to the true &s;ource of wars, when he enquires, <HI>From whence come wars, and fightings? Come they not from hence, even of your lu&s;ts, which war in your members?</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">James iv. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>The other &s;cripture brought to prove the lawfulne&s;s of war, is our Lord's &s;aying to his di&s;ciples, <HI>Let him that hath no &s;word, &s;ell his garment and buy one.</HI></P>
<P>To which I reply, That this &s;cripture has its difficul|ty; but that our Lord never de&s;igned to countenance fighting by it, I am as &s;ully convinced of, as that I have an exi&s;tence. My rea&s;ons are the&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="018525_0052_0FA7AC1A5EF4B2A8">
Fir&s;t, When the di&s;ciples an&s;wered, <HI>Lord, here are two &s;words,</HI> he replied, <HI>It is enough.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiv. 38.</NOTE> Which an&s;wer &s;uffi|ciently evinces, that this &s;cripture mu&s;t not be confined to a literal meaning. For what could two &s;words avail, again&s;t that armed multitude, which our Lord knew was coming out again&s;t him? And the general opinion of tho&s;e, &s;lyled the Fathers, was, that this &s;cripture had a my&s;tical &s;ignification.</P>
<P>Secondly, This &s;eems to be confirmed by what pa&s;&s;ed between our Lord and Peter, who in his intemperate zeal, &s;mote the &s;ervant of the High-prie&s;t, and cut off his car; for which our Lord reproved him, &s;aying, <HI>Thinke&s;t thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he &s;hall pre&s;ently give me more than twelve legions of angels? Put up therefore thy &s;word into its place.</HI> As tho' he had &s;aid, Peter, thou ha&s;t mi&s;taken me;&mdash;I do not need the&s;e carnal weapons;&mdash;No: I utterly prohibit the u&s;e of them;&mdash;<HI>For all they that take the &s;word, &s;hall peri&s;h by the &s;word.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Math. xxvi. 52, 53.</NOTE>&mdash;</P>
<P>Thirdly, Wars are not only forbidden by, but are directly oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit of the Go&s;pel. Here we are enjoined, <HI>Love your enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de&s;pitefully u&s;e and per&s;ecute you.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 44.</NOTE> <HI>If thine enemy hunger, &s;eed him; if he thir&s;t, give him drink. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven, for he maketh his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil, and on the good, and &s;endeth rain on the ju&s;t, and on the unju&s;t.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 45.</NOTE> When I&s;aiah, in vi&s;ion, &s;aw this glorious Go&s;pel-day, he &s;ang, <HI>They &s;hall beat their &s;words into plough-&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning-books: nation &s;hall not li&s;t up &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. ii. 4.</NOTE> Which prophecy is in part accompli&s;hed, in every heart, where <HI>the Prince of Peace</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. ix. 6.</NOTE> reigns.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h therefore, that well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, who have been blinded by cu&s;tom, and carried away
<PB N="54" REF="018525_0053_0FA7AC1A6D108790">with the current of evil example, would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;i|der this &s;ubject, and I am &s;atisfied, they will &s;ee the great impropriety of &s;etting apart times of prayer, for imploring the God of love, to give &s;ucce&s;s to de&s;truc|tive weapons. And I am per&s;uaded, that with great truth, it may be &s;aid to many, <HI>Ye know not what ye a&s;k.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xx. 22.</NOTE> Or as our Lord &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, on a &s;imilar occa&s;i|on, <HI>Ye know not what manner of &s;pirit ye are of</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke ix. 55.</NOTE> For it the&s;e prayers have any meaning, it is, that every bullet may do execution, and every &s;word may be bathed in blood. And to return thanks to the divine Maje&s;ty for &s;ucce&s;s of this kind, argues a mind ignorant of the divine perfections, to whom &s;uch prayers and thank&s;givings are as acceptable, as the <HI>cutting off a dog's neck, or the offering &s;wine's blood.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. lxvi. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>That frantic mirth al&s;o, which di&s;covers it&s;elf in pub|lic rejoicings on the&s;e occa&s;ions, is a di&s;grace not only to the Chri&s;tian name, but to humanity it&s;elf. The pure principle therefore, leads to an uniform te&s;timony again&s;t &s;uch ungodly cu&s;toms. And happy are they who are faithful to it, though they are the deri&s;ion of a thoughtle&s;s, giddy multitude, and even on account of their truly Chri&s;tian te&s;timony, &s;uffer the <HI>&s;poiling of their good.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 34.</NOTE></P>
<P>And all tho&s;e who take an active part in wars, are highly concerned to enquire, what is their principle of action? And, whether a di&s;pute between Princes, will ju&s;tify them in the &s;ight of God, for &s;eizing on the pro|perty and de&s;troying the lives of their fellow-creatures, even tho' they have the &s;anction of human laws!</P>
<P>I know, that the common objection is, <Q>If the&s;e pacific principles prevail, our property will become a prey to every invader.</Q> Yes; <HI>If the Lord has for&s;a|ken the earth:</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ezck. ix. 9.</NOTE> But, if <HI>the Lord reigneth,</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xciii. 1.</NOTE> and we <HI>fear his name, he will be a wall of five round about us.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">Zech. ii. 5.</NOTE> A remarkable in&s;tance of which, we have in the ca&s;e of
<PB N="55" REF="018525_0054_0FA7AC1CD5928D70">the Jews, who being enjoined by God, <HI>Thrice in the year &s;hall all your males appear</HI> (at Jeru&s;alem) <HI>before the Lord;</HI> the promi&s;e of God to them was, <HI>Neither &s;hall any man de&s;ire your land, when you &s;hall go up to appear before the Lord your God thrice in the year.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxxiv. 23, 24.</NOTE> Which promi&s;e, Jo&s;ephus, the Jewi&s;h hi&s;torian, informs us, was &s;o punctually fulfilled, that tho' their enemies knew the&s;e &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, and that their cities and towns were then defencele&s;s, yet at the&s;e times, they were never invaded, <HI>the terror of the Lord</HI> being <HI>upon the cities that were round about them.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxv. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>Nor need we look &s;o far back, as the &s;ettlement of the people called Quakers in the Province of Penn&s;yl|vania, furni&s;hes us with a recent proof of what I have advanced, and which has been &s;o remarkable, as to en|gage the attention, even of infidels. The fact is this. That province, &s;urrounded by &s;avage nations, and de&s;|titute of warlike in&s;truments, either offen&s;ive or defen|&s;ive, yet for almo&s;t a century, enjoyed uninterrupted tranquillity, while the other Provinces have been repeat|edly attacked by their &s;avage neighbours.</P>
<P>Not only &s;o, but the pacific principles of that people, and their upright conduct towards the natives, in pur|cha&s;ing the land from them, (tho' it was granted by the crown) have made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of this &s;avage people, that they have lived in perfect harmony with them, and &s;peak of W. Penn, the fir&s;t Proprietor of that province, with the greate&s;t re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I have now freely delivered my &s;entiments. I hope it has been done in a proper temper: For altho' truth leads to the greate&s;t plainne&s;s, yet it dictates no impro|per reflection, much le&s;s abu&s;ive language, which are too common in &s;ome of the mo&s;t admired, controver&s;ial writings. I intended to clo&s;e the whole, with a few remarks on the conclu&s;ion of that letter; but on a re|view, finding it made up of a number of mere decla|matory a&s;&s;ertions, calculated to mi&s;repre&s;ent and fix a &s;tigma on a religious &s;ociety of people, and totally de&s;|titute
<PB N="56" REF="018525_0055_0FA7AC1D67DF4680">of argument, I pa&s;s it over, as a proper an&s;wer would lead to &s;ome degree of &s;everity, which it has been my &s;tudy to avoid.</P>
<P>However, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I fear &s;ome per&s;ons are more concerned, to pro&s;elyte to a name, than to &s;ome|thing more &s;ub&s;tantial. When alas! What do names &s;ignify, if we are &s;trangers to the love of God, and the love of our neighbour? And what will it avail, that we are orthodox in our principles, while our hearts are heterodox? We may boa&s;t of our well-compo&s;ed forms of prayer, or pique our&s;elves that we have laid a&s;ide the&s;e inventions of men, &s;ilently to wait on the Lord; yet if our own hearts are not divinely changed, from the love and &s;pirit of the world, into the love and image of God, tho' we differ in name and &s;entiment, we all belong to one family, and are out of the true church; having only a name to live, while we are in reality, <HI>without God in the world:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 12.</NOTE> And &s;hould death cut the &s;lender thread of life, the immortal &s;pirit, which is di&s;united from God, and in a &s;tate of impurity, would be incapacitated for inhabiting his glorious kingdom; and therefore mu&s;t be excluded <HI>from his pre&s;ence.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;. i. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>I therefore earne&s;tly wi&s;h, that all blind, party zeal may come to an end; that in&s;tead of laboring to fix a &s;tigma on tho&s;e, who &s;ee it their duty to di&s;&s;ent from us, our great concern may be, to guard again&s;t a nar|row, unchri&s;tian &s;pirit: And may the uniform language of our hearts and lives be, <HI>Henceforth know we no man after the fle&s;h.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 16.</NOTE> <HI>For who&s;oever &s;hall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the &s;ame is my Brother, and Si&s;ter, and Mother.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mar. xii. 50.</NOTE></P>
