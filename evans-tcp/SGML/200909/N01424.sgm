<Q><BIBL>Job XVI. 6.</BIBL>
<P><HI>Tho' I &s;peak, my Grief is not a&s;&s;waged; and tho' I forbear, what am I ea&s;ed?</HI></P></Q>
<P>IT is Probable, and more than &s;o, That every Per&s;on in this A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Zion,</HI> has <HI>Bitter Griefs</HI> that may be complain|ed of: There is not an <HI>Heart</HI> but what <HI>knows its own Bitterne&s;s.</HI> But it is as probable, that the <HI>Griefs</HI> of many People are <HI>Incurable</HI> ones; <HI>Griefs</HI> hopelefs of any <HI>Cure</HI> in this World; There is nothing that can be done to <HI>Cure</HI> them. It may be &s;aid unto them, as in Jer. XXX. 12. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, Thy Brui&s;e as Incurable, and thy Wound is Griev|ous.</HI></P>
<P>This CASE, <HI>What &s;hall be done
<PB N="4" REF="001691_0003_0FB52A2596F75948">with Griefs, when there is no Cu|ring of them?</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> which I make no doubt, very many are concerned in; A <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> which I make no doubt, may be very Pro|fitably, and very Sea&s;onably di&s;|cour&s;ed on.</P>
<P>My Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Ca&s;e, will have an agreeable Introducti|on, in pointing you to an In&s;tance of it. The celebrated <HI>Job,</HI> was one in whom you find it in&s;tanced. It is well noted by the famous Jew <HI>Maimonides,</HI> That the Book of <HI>Job</HI> Was written, to E&s;tabli&s;h us in the grand Article of Divine Provi|dence. And the <HI>Mahometans</HI> them|&s;elves, look upon it, as written to In&s;truct us in this particular My|&s;tery of that Providence; That God may Afflict tho&s;e, whom He has a great Favour for. He who writes the Ancient Commentaries on this Book, under the Name of <HI>Origen,</HI> &s;ays, that he found this Tradition, <HI>In Antiquorum dictis,</HI> That <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> beholding the Cala|mities
<PB N="5" REF="001691_0004_0FB52A27F1DDAFA0">of his Brethren in <HI>Egypt,</HI> made a Pre&s;ent of this Hi&s;tory un|to them, to Encourage their Ex|pectations, that if they &s;uffered Pa|tiently, God would in the latter End be&s;tow &s;uch a Deliverance upon them, as He did upon His Patient Servant <HI>Job.</HI> And in like manner, it was the Cu&s;tome of the Primitive Chri&s;tians, when they vi&s;ited one another in their per&s;o|nal Calamities, to Read a Le&s;&s;on out of <HI>Job</HI> in their Vi&s;its, for the Support of their Minds under what had befallen them.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, I do no New Thing, when I call in the Patriarch <HI>Job,</HI> to &s;erve the Intention, of giving &s;ome Direction about <HI>Incurable Ca|lamities.</HI> The Afflicted Patriarch here Complains of his <HI>Grief,</HI> as be|ing <HI>Incurable.</HI> Says he, <HI>Tho' I &s;peak, my Grief is not a&s;&s;waged; and tho' I forbear; what am I ea&s;ed.</HI>
<Q>Neither <HI>Speaking</HI> nor <HI>Silence,</HI> will do any thing for my <HI>Cure.</HI> Let me try what <HI>Methods</HI> I will, my <HI>Grief</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001691_0005_0FB52A2956077720">will remain without a <HI>Cure.</HI></Q> Per|haps, it was not without &s;ome Eye to this Pa&s;&s;age, that <HI>Elibu</HI> charged <HI>Job,</HI> in Chap. XXXIV. 6. with &s;aying, <HI>My Wound is Incurable.</HI> Be that as it will, my DOCTRINE will be Inconte&s;tible.</P>
<P><HI>The Children of Men are frequently troubled with Griefs which cannot be Cured.</HI></P>
<P>Many People have &s;uch <HI>Griefs</HI> as they have little hopes to <HI>A&s;&s;wage</HI> and have <HI>ea&s;ed,</HI> as long as they are in this <HI>pre&s;ent Evil World.</HI> Many People meet with <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> which they can't hope to &s;ee re|moved; but mu&s;t look to <HI>bear</HI> them as well as they <HI>can;</HI> it may be, as long as they <HI>live.</HI> The <HI>Weeping Pro|phet</HI> &s;aid of the &s;hare which he mu&s;t have in the Woful Things that came upon his Country; Jer. X. 19. <HI>This is a Grief, and I mu&s;t bear it.</HI> We &s;ee many a <HI>Grief,</HI> which there is no Redre&s;&s;ing of; We mu&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="001691_0006_0FB52A2E2060E120"><HI>bear</HI> it. But the Ca&s;e now is, <HI>How to bear it?</HI> This is to be &s;poken to.</P>
<P N="1">I. And it will contribute a little unto it, for us to lay down in the fir&s;t Place, this more general Ob|&s;ervation. <HI>Griefs mu&s;t come;</HI> There are <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> which in <HI>this World</HI> mu&s;t be met withal. They are in the very Nature of the <HI>Cli|mate.</HI> It is the Condition of <HI>Man|kind;</HI> the <HI>common Lot,</HI> the <HI>con&s;tant Fate,</HI> which every <HI>Mothers Son</HI> mu&s;t look for: A Condition of Afflicti|on, which is <HI>not Joyous but Grievous.</HI> We Read, Job XIV. 1. <HI>Man that is born of a Woman, is of &s;hort Life, and full of Trouble.</HI></P>
<P>We will a little Enquire after the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Grievous Things</HI> that are appointed for us. For, <HI>Is there not a Cau&s;e?</HI> My Brethren, 'Tis not a meer <HI>Chance</HI> that brings our <HI>Griefs.</HI> Let us leave it unto the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> to &s;ay, <HI>It is a Chance that happens unto us.</HI> To a&s;cribe our <HI>Grievous Things</HI> unto a <HI>Blind For|tune;</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001691_0007_0FB52A2F56829E78">to make no more of it than this, <HI>It was my hard Fortune;</HI> 'tis a very Fooli&s;h and Faulty <HI>Blindne&s;s.</HI> There is no <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> and as little <HI>Grace,</HI> in the Expre&s;&s;ion, tho' it be a very frequent one. I remember, the Holy one threatens His Peo|ple; Lev. XXVI. 24. <HI>If ye walk contrary unto me.</HI> The Original Word &s;ignifies, not, <HI>Contrariety,</HI> but, <HI>Contingency.</HI> The Learned Jews Ex|plain it with &s;uch a Reading, <HI>If ye walk in the way of Chance.</HI> And who do &s;o? They mo&s;t Emphati|cally, who don't look above <HI>Chance</HI> in the <HI>Events</HI> which in their <HI>Walk</HI> they meet withal. They who don't &s;ee and own the <HI>Providence</HI> of God in all Events. Of &s;uch People it is threatned by God. That He will <HI>Walk in the way of Chance</HI> with them, and will regard their Prayers no more than if there were nothing but a <HI>Chance</HI> to Govern their Af|fairs. But,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Our <HI>Sin</HI> is the Cau&s;e of our <HI>Grief.</HI> Our <HI>Sin</HI> has made us <HI>worthy</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="001691_0008_0FB52A31B5455FF8">of <HI>Grievous Things.</HI> 'Tis to Cha|&s;ti&s;e us for our <HI>Sin,</HI> that the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of Heaven di&s;pences to us all our <HI>Grievous Things.</HI> Whenever any <HI>Grief</HI> befalls us, it may be &s;aid unto us, as in Jer. IV. 18. <HI>Thy Way and thy Doings have procured the&s;e Things un|to thee; This is thy Wickedne&s;s.</HI> It was by <HI>Sin,</HI> that the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> of Hea|ven was fir&s;t brought upon the Earth. In tho&s;e Terms was the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> denounced; Gen. III. 17, 18. <HI>Cur&s;ed is the Ground for thy &s;ake; in Sorrow &s;halt thou Eat of it all the Days of thy Life. Thorns al&s;o and Thi&s;tles it &s;hall bring forth unto thee.</HI> All the <HI>Grievous Things</HI> that Embitter our Lives, are the <HI>Thorns</HI> and <HI>Thi&s;tles,</HI> which the Earth does bring forth unto us. No Corner of the Earth is free from them. The <HI>Cottage</HI> has them; the <HI>Palace</HI> al&s;o has them. The <HI>Fir&s;t Adams World</HI> is always full of <HI>Grievous Things;</HI> Ever a Stranger to <HI>uninterrupted Pro&s;perity.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Vain</HI> Thing to flatter our &s;elves. <HI>This World</HI> will be always
<PB N="10" REF="001691_0009_0FB52A3315FFD218">filled with <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Vexation.</HI> In|deed our <HI>Second Adam</HI> will bring us into a <HI>Better World.</HI> In the <HI>World to come,</HI> we read, Rev. XXI. 4. <HI>There &s;hall be no more Death, neither Sorrow nor Crying:</HI> And Rev. XXII. 3. <HI>There &s;hall be no more Cur&s;es.</HI> But until we come into <HI>that World,</HI> we &s;hall al|ways have &s;ome <HI>Fruits</HI> of the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> to Conflict withal; &s;ome <HI>Grievous Things</HI> always attending of us. Ah, <HI>Sin, Sin;</HI> Thou art the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;er of the Nations!</HI></P>
<P>A very plain Inference I now &s;ee &s;o lying before me, that there is indeed no &s;hunning of it. I Infer, Certainly, our <HI>Sin</HI> ought now to be our <HI>Grief.</HI> Oh! make it thy <HI>Grief,</HI> and except what the Blood of thy Saviour &s;hall bring unto thee, do not ask for any thing, that may <HI>A&s;&s;wage</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Grief</HI> that will not work thy <HI>Death,</HI> as every other will, but will &s;ave thee from it.

XXXVIII. 18. <HI>I will be &s;orry for my Sin.</HI> We Read of &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ed Thing, as <HI>A Godly Sorrow, working Repentance to Salvation which is not to be Repen|ted of.</HI> May every <HI>Grief</HI> which trou|bles us, be turned into that <HI>Channel:</HI> A <HI>Grief,</HI> becau&s;e we have <HI>&s;inned,</HI> &amp; we have by our <HI>Sin</HI> provoked the Holy One to &s;end our <HI>Grief</HI> upon us. May all our <HI>Grievous Things</HI> cau&s;e us to Reflect on our <HI>Sins,</HI> &amp; fill us with <HI>Grievus Thoughts</HI> becau&s;e of our <HI>Sins.</HI> My Brethren, I am &s;o far from any Wi&s;h to &s;ee this <HI>Grief cured</HI> in you, that I wi&s;h it may be ever growing in you as long as you live; and that it may Accompany you to the la&s;t Moment of your Lives. O <HI>Dye</HI> in the mid&s;t of this <HI>Grief;</HI> and &s;o, <HI>Enter into the Joy of your Lord.</HI> It is a <HI>Grief</HI> that will <HI>End</HI> in a <HI>Joy</HI> which will never have an <HI>End!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. But, who was the <HI>Father of Sin?</HI> Give him his <HI>Due;</HI> He mu&s;t be brought in, as having an Hand
<PB N="12" REF="001691_0016_0FB52A4217B25090">in the <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> which Dar|ken the World. <HI>Satan</HI> has a mighty Hand in them; Satan, the <HI>Prince of this World;</HI> Satan, the <HI>Ruler of the Darkne&s;s of this World.</HI> That <HI>Angel of Death,</HI> by the Permi&s;&s;ion of a ju&s;t God, &s;ills this World with <HI>Griev|ous Things,</HI> and with <HI>Deadly</HI> Ones. When <HI>Grievous Things</HI> befel the good People of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> our Savi|our told them, <HI>The Divel</HI> was the Doer of them. <HI>Satan,</HI> with his <HI>Le|gions</HI> of wicked Spirits, having lo&s;t his own Comforts, is full of <HI>Envy</HI> at ours. By our <HI>Fir&s;t Sin,</HI> we fell under his <HI>Dominion;</HI> Oh! what a <HI>Grievous</HI> one! By every <HI>New Sin,</HI> e&s;pecially if it be a <HI>Gro&s;s</HI> one, we give him a fre&s;h Advantage to ob|tain a Commi&s;&s;ion for our further Annoyance. We Read, Joh. VIII. 44. <HI>He was a Murderer from the Be|ginning.</HI> And who can tell, what <HI>Grievous Things</HI> are done, by the Influence and Energy of that <HI>Mur|derer</HI> upon the &s;inful Children of Men! The Ancient Pagans had
<PB N="13" REF="001691_0017_0FB52A4397B5B7A8">their Minds much exerci&s;ed upon that Que&s;tion, <HI>What was the Origin of Evil;</HI> Or, <HI>Whence Evil came in upon us?</HI> There was a Tradition among them, and a very old one it was, That there were Two fir&s;t Prin|ciples; One called <HI>Oromazes,</HI> who might be re&s;embled unto Light; Another called, <HI>Arimanius,</HI> who might be re&s;embled unto <HI>Darkne&s;s;</HI> the one a <HI>God,</HI> the other a <HI>Daemou.</HI> The one lodged this World, like an <HI>Egg</HI> under the &s;hell of his Fa|vour; the other broke and pierc'd the Shell, and in&s;inuated a Mix|ture of <HI>Evil</HI> into all that is Good. A Tradition that contain'd in it &s;ome notable Reliques of Truth: <HI>God,</HI> the Maker of the World, and the Author of all <HI>Good; Satan,</HI> the Spoiler of the World, and the Foun|tain of all <HI>Evil.</HI> The Re&s;ult is, That the <HI>Grief</HI> of Mankind, is the Delight of Satan; What <HI>Grieves</HI> us, does Gladden him. He has no Plea&s;ure, but that of an <HI>Executioner</HI> in <HI>Grievous Things</HI> upon a World,
<PB N="14" REF="001691_0018_0FB52A45D6E90938">which alas, is always too worthy of them.</P>
<P>And here again, I could not but &s;ee an Inference, that looks Black upon &s;ome among the Children of Men. I infer, To be <HI>pleas'd</HI> becau&s;e our Neighbours are <HI>griev'd,</HI> this is a Satanic Di&s;po&s;ition. The Chil|dren of Men, who love to make or &s;ee others <HI>Mi&s;erable;</HI> I &s;hall but &s;peak <HI>Scripturally</HI> of them, if I &s;ay, they are too like the <HI>Children of the Divel;</HI> They have the Image of <HI>Sa|tan</HI> very plain upon them. We may &s;ay, <HI>In this the Children of God are Manife&s;t, and the Children of the Di|vel.</HI> The <HI>Children of God;</HI> the&s;e are <HI>full of all Goodne&s;s;</HI> like their Fa|ther, they <HI>are Good,</HI> they <HI>do Good;</HI> they Rejoice in the Pro&s;perity of their Neighbours. The <HI>Groans</HI> of the <HI>Mi&s;erable,</HI> are a Mu&s;ic to none but <HI>Satan,</HI> and his Children. In|deed, there may be the <HI>Triumphs</HI> of the Righteous, in the <HI>Ruines</HI> of the Wicked. But &s;till the <HI>Triumphs</HI> have the <HI>Sorrows</HI> of a Gracious and
<PB N="15" REF="001691_0010_0FB52A35578D1938">to &s;ay with him; P&s;al. XXXVIII. 18. <HI>I will be &s;orry for my Sin.</HI> We Read of &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ed Thing, as <HI>A Godly Sorrow, working Repentance to Salvation which is not to be Repen|ted of.</HI> May every <HI>Grief</HI> which trou|bles us, be turned into that <HI>Channel:</HI> A <HI>Grief,</HI> becau&s;e we have <HI>&s;inned,</HI> &amp; we have by our <HI>Sin</HI> provoked the Holy One to &s;end our <HI>Grief</HI> upon us. May all our <HI>Grievous Things</HI> cau&s;e us to Reflect on our <HI>Sins,</HI> &amp; fill us with <HI>Grievus Thoughts</HI> becau&s;e of our <HI>Sins.</HI> My Brethren, I am &s;o far from any Wi&s;h to &s;ee this <HI>Grief cured</HI> in you, that I wi&s;h it may be ever growing in you as long as you live; and that it may Accompany you to the la&s;t Moment of your Lives.

<P>Secondly. But, who was the <HI>Father of Sin?</HI> Give him his <HI>Due;</HI> He mu&s;t be brought in, as having an Hand
<PB N="16" REF="001691_0011_0FB52A36D604B800">pen&s;ations of a Divine and mo&s;t Glorious <HI>Providence.</HI> Whoever, or whatever <HI>Grieves</HI> us, by <HI>taking away</HI> what is dear unto us, we mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>'Tis the Lord who has taken away!</HI> Whatever <HI>In&s;truments</HI> may <HI>Grievs</HI> us, they are but <HI>In&s;truments.</HI> We may &s;ay, <HI>The Lord has bidden them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grievous Things</HI> which befal the <HI>Reprobate</HI> part of Mankind; The&s;e are the <HI>Puni&s;hments,</HI> which God in His Holy <HI>Providence</HI> does inflict upon them. In the&s;e <HI>Griev|ous Things</HI> He re&s;trains them from &s;uch Outrages, as wou'd el&s;e break up <HI>Humane Society.</HI> In the&s;e <HI>Grievous Things</HI> He lays them up in tho&s;e <HI>Fetters,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>Dungeons,</HI> that are to go before their final Execution.</P>
<P>And then, the <HI>Grievous Things</HI> which befal the People of God, belong to the <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> wherewith His Holy <HI>Providence</HI> does prepare them for their Eternal Happine&s;s. By the&s;e <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> He weans them from a World, in which they would el&s;e be too willing to Abide,
<PB N="17" REF="001691_0019_0FB52A4755F6ECC0">and carry on multiplied <HI>Idolatries;</HI> He kills the Weeds of tho&s;e <HI>Cor|ruptions</HI> that would unqualify them for His Kingdom. He awakens them to the <HI>Things that are Holy and Ju&s;t and Good.</HI> By the&s;e <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> He Humbles them, He Quickens them, He Ripens them for Heaven; He fits them for the <HI>Inheritance</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly Places</HI> re|&s;erved for them. The Things <HI>which for the pre&s;ent are not Joyous but Griev|ous,</HI> do afterwards yield the <HI>Peacea|ble Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>From this there will be an In|ference, that is very Obvious. I Infer, We have to do with <HI>God,</HI> as often as any thing that is <HI>Grievous</HI> occurs unto us. O all you that are in any <HI>Grief,</HI> Remember this; <HI>God</HI> orders it, <HI>God</HI> appoints it; You have to do with <HI>God</HI> in every <HI>Grief.</HI> To every one of 'your' <HI>Grievous Things</HI> you may &s;ay, <HI>Thou coulde&s;t have had no Power again&s;t me, if God had not given it.</HI> You have no <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> but &s;uch as <HI>God</HI> has laid upon you.
<PB N="18" REF="001691_0012_0FB52A3930628920">'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to com|mend unto you a more u&s;eful Con|templation.</P>
<P N="2">II.

<P>Fir&s;t.

<P>But this Advice cannot leave us, without an Admonition; <HI>Heaven|born Souls,</HI> Long for <HI>Heaven!</HI> Since the <HI>pre&s;ent State</HI> will and mu&s;t be a <HI>Grievous</HI> one, e'en bear it, as long as God &s;hall plea&s;e to keep you in it.

<P>Secondly.

<P>Again; <HI>Grievous Accidents</HI> may come upon us. But they were <HI>Un|fore&s;een.</HI> We could not by any <HI>Fore|&s;ight</HI> or <HI>Caution,</HI> or <HI>Parry,</HI> keep them off. And they are <HI>come,</HI> they con|not be <HI>Cured.</HI> The <HI>Grief</HI> will abide;

<P>Fir&s;t. There are <HI>Corporal</HI> Indi&s;|po&s;itions, wherewith many are in|commoded; and &s;uch as are not <HI>Curable</HI> ones. They are Indi&s;po&s;i|tions that will <HI>&s;tick</HI> by you: If they don't <HI>&s;horten</HI> your Lives, yet they

<P>I will add; The <HI>Female-Sex</HI> is become &s;ubject unto &s;everal Cir|cum&s;tances, that, no doubt, are <HI>Grievous</HI> ones.

<P>Secondly. There are <HI>Impoveri&s;h|ments,</HI> which many do undergo, and mu&s;t undergo; there can be no <HI>Curing</HI> of them. You mu&s;t be <HI>Low</HI> in the World; you can't get clear of the Things that will keep you <HI>Low.</HI> There are many Things;

<P>Thirdly. There are &s;ome, who have their <HI>Adver&s;aries;</HI> People are di&s;affected unto them: The <HI>Di&s;|affection</HI> is <HI>Invaterate.</HI> It had perhaps

Why, with incomparable <HI>Meekne&s;s;</HI> With the utmo&s;t Abhor|rence of all <HI>Per&s;onal Revenge;</HI> with Generous and Exqui&s;ite Projecti|ons, <HI>How to overcome Evil with Good?</HI> But this is not all. <HI>Mend your Pace,</HI> for Allatrations: as the <HI>Reine Deer,</HI> for the <HI>Dog</HI> in the <HI>Sled:</HI> Let your <HI>Pace</HI> in doing all the Good that is po&s;&s;ible, be quickened by the Noi&s;e of your Enemies, as much as 'tis po&s;&s;ible.
