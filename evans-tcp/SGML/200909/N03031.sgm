<P>_THE Words are <HI>few,</HI> but very <HI>awful,</HI> and aw|fully to be regarded. Let us con&s;ider with great Reverence and Attention, <HI>Who</HI> it is that here &s;peaks, <HI>who</HI> is &s;poken of, <HI>what</HI> is &s;aid, to <HI>whom</HI> and on what <HI>Occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It is the LORD GOD OF HOSTS &s;peak|ing of <HI>Him&s;elf.</HI> Let the Earth be moved, and all that dwell on it be &s;ilent and attentive.</P>
<P>The <HI>Stile</HI> of the true and living GOD, the Lord JEHOVAH, the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> is this &mdash; <HI>"His Name is the</HI> LORD OF HOSTS. The true GOD mu&s;t be &s;o; and HE that is the LORD <HI>of all Ho&s;ts</HI> mu&s;t be the true GOD. For the <HI>Stile</HI> &s;peaks and affirms &s;upream, univer&s;al and ab&s;olute <HI>Dominion</HI> over all Worlds, and over all Things in Heaven and Earth. I&s;al. xxxvii. 16. <HI>O</HI> LORD GOD <HI>of Ho&s;ts,</HI> GOD <HI>of I&s;rael, Thou art the</HI> GOD, <HI>even thou alone.</HI> It is the appropriate and incommunicable Name of the eternal, infinite, almighty and incomprehen&s;ible GODHEAD: And after the Name JEHOVAH there is none by which GOD has pleas'd to make Him&s;elf known, that is more Magnificent than this, THE LORD OF HOSTS. 1 Chron. xvii. 24. <HI>That thy Name may be magnified for ever, &s;aying, The</HI> LORD OF HOSTS <HI>is the</HI> GOD <HI>of I&s;rael even a</HI> GOD <HI>to I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003645_0004_10023BAA4A5BF658">
This mighty LORD, the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate,</HI> here &s;peaks of <HI>Him&s;elf:</HI> Him&s;elf the <HI>Speaker</HI> and Him&s;elf the <HI>Subject.</HI> He cannot &s;peak of a <HI>Greater,</HI> and He only is fit to &s;peak of <HI>Him|&s;elf,</HI> who only comprehends Him&s;elf. <HI>For the things of God know|eth no Man</HI> (nor Angel) <HI>out the</HI> SPIRIT OF GOD: As He plea&s;es to reveal concerning Him&s;elf unto his Creatures. Job xxxvii. 19. <HI>Teach us what we &s;hall &s;ay, for we cannot order our Speech by rea&s;on of Darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Words <HI>worthy of Him&s;elf,</HI> truly <HI>great</HI> and <HI>glorious,</HI> are here &s;poken: <HI>I am a</HI> GREAT KING <HI>&s;aith the</HI> LORD OF HOSTS.</P>
<P>He is a KING: that is the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> that can be &s;aid of Him, tho' <HI>Kings</HI> are the greate&s;t and highe&s;t Things we have on Earth: And becau&s;e we have none <HI>greater</HI> here below, there|fore are <HI>Kings</HI> the &s;hadows to us of the DIVINE MAJESTY.</P>
<P>But the LORD is a GREAT KING. How <HI>Great</HI> can't be &s;aid. The <HI>Potentates</HI> of this World are <HI>little</HI> parcels of Du&s;t, and Worms before HIM. It is a <HI>&s;mall</HI> thing to &s;ay of the <HI>great</HI> GOD, <HI>He is higher than the Kings of the Earth.</HI> He is the great King of <HI>Heaven,</HI> the <HI>King of Glory.</HI> His <HI>He&s;ts</HI> &s;peak be&s;t how great his <HI>Dominion</HI> is: P&s;alm. xxiv. 10. <HI>The Lord of Ho&s;ts, He is the King of Glory.</HI> Jerem. xlvii. 18. <HI>As I live, &s;aith the</HI> KING, <HI>who&s;e Name is the</HI> LORD OF HOSTS.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To whom,</HI> and upon what <HI>Occa&s;ion,</HI> &s;pake the Great GOD the&s;e Words of Him&s;elf? It was to his <HI>wor&s;hiping People,</HI> and to his <HI>Pric&s;ts,</HI> the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of Religion among them. It was to <HI>&s;trike</HI> them with an awful Apprehen&s;ion of his own Maje&s;ty and Greatne&s;s. It was to <HI>reprove</HI> them for and <HI>convince</HI> them of, their profane and contemptuous Carriage toward Him, in their pretended Wor&s;hip. It was to <HI>arraign,</HI> terrify and humble a wicked, hypocritical, formal, profe&s;&s;ing People; to admoni&s;h them of his Power, Ju&s;tice and Wrath, and that he was coming near unto them in Judgment. <HI>Cur&s;ed be the Deceiver that hath in his Flock a Male, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">oweth and &s;acrificeth to the LORD, a corrupt thing: For I am a</HI> GREAT KING, <HI>&s;aith the</HI> LORD OF HOSTS, <HI>and my Name is dreadful.</HI> P&s;alm. xlvii. 2. <HI>For the</HI> LORD, <HI>mo&s;t High, is nerrible; He is a great King over all the Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. GOD <HI>is a</HI> KING. He <HI>conde&s;cends</HI> to take this <HI>Stile</HI> to Him|&s;elf. It is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and e&s;&s;ential to Him to be <HI>King</HI> of the World: King <HI>over</HI> all his Works and <HI>unto</HI> all, for his <HI>own Glory</HI> and <HI>their Good</HI> His is <HI>the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory,</HI> by a natural unalienable Right, Propriety and ab&s;olute Authority. The CREATOR of all things mu&s;t have the Sove|reign and inconce&s;tible Dominion over all, and the Great
<PB N="3" REF="003645_0005_10023BABDA2CF550">PRESERVER of all things mu&s;t exerci&s;e Government and Rule over all.</P>
<P N="1">1. As a King GOD gives <HI>Laws</HI> to his Creatures. I&s;ai. xxxiii. 22. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>is our Lawgiver, the</HI> LORD <HI>is our King.</HI> He has written his Law <HI>in</HI> Man, and he has publi&s;h'd it <HI>to</HI> him. He has pa&s;s'd it with <HI>Royal</HI> Maje&s;ty, <HI>"I am the</HI> LORD. He came down from Heaven in great Glory, and proclaim'd it with Sound of <HI>Trumpet,</HI> and a Di&s;charge of the <HI>Artillery</HI> of Heaven. He gives Laws to <HI>Angels</HI> that are higher than we, and they do his Will, hearkning to the Voice of his Word. He has given his Law to the mighty Frame of the <HI>Univer&s;e,</HI> even to all the va&s;t <HI>Globes</HI> in all their various <HI>Circles;</HI> and they con|tinue this day in their excellent Order and wonderful Motion, according to his Ordinance, for all are his Servants. In our lower Regions, <HI>Fire, Hail and Snow, Vapour and &s;tormy Wind fulfil his Word.</HI> This is a <HI>Kingly Part</HI> to give Laws and Or|ders unto all, and to be obeyed.</P>
<P N="2">2. As <HI>more</HI> than a King, He <HI>&s;u&s;tains and upholds</HI> all things in Being. He is the <HI>Breath of our No&s;trils:</HI> Our <HI>Life</HI> and the length of our Days. In Him we live and move and have our Being. He pre&s;erveth Man and Bea&s;t. In his Hand is the Soul of every living thing, and the breath of all Mankind. How much more is this than the Protection, Defence or Main|tenance, that Princes and Governments on Earth can afford their Subjects. Should God remove his &s;u&s;taining Hand, all Fle&s;h would peri&s;h together, and all Worlds would fall into Ruine and Confu&s;ion. The <HI>Orbs</HI> of the Univer&s;e would <HI>do&s;h</HI> one again&s;t another, and run into their original <HI>Chaos,</HI> and Darkne&s;s would cover the De&s;olation for ever and ever&punc; GOD <HI>hears up</HI> the Pillars of the Earth, or it and its Inhabitants would <HI>di&s;&s;olve</HI> together, P&s;alm. lxxv. 3.</P>
<P N="3">3. More than Princely or Kingly is <HI>his Royal Bounty</HI> and Munificence. He keeps the Table and Fea&s;t of a King. He feeds all his Creatures. <HI>He giveth Food to all Fle&s;h.</HI> All Eyes wait on Him, and he giveth them their Meat in due Sea&s;on. He fills 'em with Good, he &s;atisfies the De&s;ire of every liv|ing thing. The Earth is full of his Riches. <HI>All things come of Him,</HI> and it is <HI>of his own</HI> that we make our Returns to Him. This is more than <HI>Royal:</HI> it is a Glory truly <HI>Divine:</HI> 1 Chron. xxix. 11. <HI>Thine O Lord is the Greatne&s;s, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Maje&s;ty! for all that is in the Heaven and on the Earth is thine; thine is the Kingdom, O</HI> LORD, <HI>and Thou art exalted Head above all.</HI> Earthly <HI>Kings</HI> are &s;upported in their Magnificence by their Subjects, but the <HI>Divine</HI> MAJESTY &s;upplies all his Dominions with all they have,
<PB N="4" REF="003645_0006_10023BAD6AD754B8">and gives them all things richly to enjoy. ver. 16. O LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD, <HI>all this &s;tore cometh of thy Hand, and it is all thine own.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 As a King GOD <HI>judges, rewards and puni&s;hes.</HI> He doeth Judgment and Ju&s;tice. The&s;e are the <HI>Habitation of his Throne.</HI> He reigns and rules in Righteou&s;ne&s;s. He is the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> LORD in the mid&s;t of us. He governs by Law; ju&s;t and right is He. He <HI>loveth Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and executeth Judgment in the Earth:</HI> He <HI>is excellent in Judgment, and in plenty of Ju&s;tice: Holy in all his Ways and Works.</HI> There is no Iniquity with the LORD our GOD, nor Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. As a King he <HI>rewards the Good.</HI> His Countenance be|holds the Upright. Verily there is a Reward for the Righ|teous. The&s;e He delights to honour; He dignifies and enobles them. He rewards like a King with a munificent Hand. Eye has not &s;een, nor Ear heard, neither hath it enter'd in|to the Heart of Man to conceive the things which GOD has prepared for them that love him. The LORD will render to every Man his Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Faithfulne&s;s; He will re|compence his Work, and a full Reward &s;hall be given him. He ble&s;&s;es indeed, with all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, in hea|venly Places. The LORD will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. He has Crowns and Kingdoms to give; the <HI>Crown of Life,</HI> a <HI>Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As a King He <HI>puni&s;hes the Wicked,</HI> the Enemies of his Crown and Dignity. He will not hold them guiltle&s;s. He will render Vengeance to his Enemies, and de&s;troy them that hate Him. He is able to &s;ave and to de&s;troy. The wicked &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed. His Power and his Wrath are a|gain&s;t them that for&s;ake Him. He &s;eeth Wickedne&s;s, and will not acquit. He has appointed a Day, in which he will Judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Then his Enemies, who would not have him to reign over them, &s;hall be brought forth and &s;lain before Him. They &s;hall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget GOD. Thus <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>is our</HI> KING, <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>is our</HI> JUDGE. He judges Men now, he will judge them in the la&s;t and great Day. His Reward is with Him.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="5">5. As a King he leads his <HI>Armies</HI> to War, and <HI>fights</HI> his Battles. He has Enemies in War again&s;t Him; and his King|dom, People and Cau&s;e to defend. He is <HI>the</HI> GOD <HI>of Armies, the</HI> LORD <HI>&s;trong and mighty, the</HI> LORD <HI>mighty in Battle. He comes down to fight for Mount Zion, and for the Hill thereof.</HI> He mu&s;ters the Ho&s;ts of <HI>Angels,</HI> and covers the Mountains
<PB N="5" REF="003645_0007_10023BAF00703A78">with invi&s;ible Chariots and Hor&s;es of Fire. He commands the Stars in their Cour&s;es to fight again&s;t <HI>Si&s;era,</HI> and the Clouds to fire and thunder upon the <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI> Again, He (the mo&s;t Mighty) girds his Sword upon his Thigh, with his Glory and his Maje&s;ty; and in his Maje&s;ty rides pro&s;|perou&s;ly becau&s;e of Truth and Meekne&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and his right Hand doth terrible Things; His Arrows are &s;harp in the hearts of his Enemies, and the People fall under Him. He takes hold of Shield and Buckler, and &s;tands up for the Help of his People; He draws out the Spear and &s;tops the Way again&s;t their Per&s;ecutors. He pre&s;ides over the great Events of War and Battles, and there is no King &s;aved by the Multitude of an Ho&s;t, a mighty Man is not deliver'd by his much Strength. He giveth Salvation unto Kings, and delivereth his Servants from the hurtful Sword.</P>
<P N="6">6. As a King He has <HI>Princes</HI> under Him, and &s;ends his <HI>Envoys and Amba&s;&s;adors</HI> on Treaties of Peace, or to denounce War and Death; Or to promi&s;e Succour to the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and Salvation to them that are ready to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>He has his mighty <HI>Angels</HI> that &s;tand in his Pre&s;ence, and go on his Me&s;&s;ages, and arm at his Word. They are his Glory and Court above; and are they not mini&s;tring Spirits &s;ent forth to the World below? Whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers, they are alike his Mini&s;ters of Mercy or of Judgment, according to the Or|ders they receive from Him. <HI>Gabriel</HI> flies down to <HI>David</HI> on the Wings of Love, and Another draws on the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian Ho&s;t</HI> and &s;lays an Army in a Night.</P>
<P><HI>Kings</HI> on Earth are his Sub&s;titutes here below, their Hearts are in his Hand, and he turns 'em like the Rivers of Water, which wind thro' the Earth and enrich and adorn it. They propo&s;e and project, but GOD di&s;po&s;es, to Events contrary to their Intentions. He makes them his Rod and Sword, which He breaks or burns as &s;oon as he has us'd <HI>The Pillars of the Earth are his, and he hath &s;et the World upon them.</HI></P>
<P>He has a <HI>peculiar Order of Men,</HI> whom He Calls and &s;epa|rates unto and for Him&s;elf, to be his <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and Me&s;&s;en|gers to a wicked World. Such were his <HI>Prophets</HI> in the Days of the Old Te&s;tament, and the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> of our LORD JESUS CHRIST afterward: Such were the <HI>Levites</HI> under the Law to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;uch are <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> the Gifts of the A&s;|cended SAVIOUR to his Church unto the End of the World His Commi&s;&s;ion to them is that, Matt. xxviii. 19. <HI>Go, teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the</HI> FATHER, <HI>and of
<PB N="6" REF="003645_0008_10023B5F8B6C1280">the</HI> SON, <HI>and of the</HI> HOLY GHOST; <HI>teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have Commanded you,</HI> &amp;c. And the Diguity here|in put on them is that, 2 Corinth. v. 20. <HI>New then we are Amba&s;&s;adors from</HI> CHRIST, <HI>as tho'</HI> GOD <HI>did be&s;eech you by us, we pray you in</HI> CHRIST's <HI>&s;tead, Be ye reconciled to</HI> GOD. The&s;e <HI>Men of</HI> GOD come to us in the Name of the Great King of Heaven, clothed with his Authority, with his Word in their Mouth, and they &s;ay to <HI>Zion, Thy</HI> GOD <HI>reigneth!, thy</HI> KING <HI>cometh, bringing Salvation.</HI> They bring the Alarm of <HI>War,</HI> and Denunciation of Wrath again&s;t the wicked and ungodly: And they bring Me&s;&s;ages of <HI>Peace,</HI> a Proclamation of Pardon and Grace unto penitent believing Sinners. They come upon the mo&s;t honourable and momentous Concern that can be, the Salvation of lo&s;t Souls; and <HI>how beautiful &s;hould their Feet be</HI> unto all to whom they are &s;ent?</P>
<P N="7">7. And la&s;tly, As a King <HI>He receives Petitions, and claims Tri|bute, Wor&s;hip and Obedience.</HI> He &s;its upon a Throne of Grace, with his golden Scepter in his hand, and to them that ap|proach him with a loyal Heart he holds it forth; for them to kneel down and ki&s;s it. He is the <HI>rightful King</HI> that has ju&s;tly forbidden Men to make Petition unto any <HI>God</HI> be&s;ide Him. He receives our Prayers by the Hand of his own SON, in who&s;e Name he has bid us ask of Him. He &s;ays to the humble Petitioner, <HI>What is thy Reque&s;t and it &s;hall be given thee, even to a Kingdom?</HI> We have a Right thro' Grace, a Liberty of Acce&s;s thro' CHRIST, to go and <HI>cry to the King:</HI> P&s;al. xx. 9. <HI>Save</HI> LORD! <HI>let the King hear us when we call.</HI></P>
<P>He claims a Tribute of Duty, Honour and Service from us. Such as we have to give, which al&s;o we receive from Him, he accepts at our Hands. We are His, and all that we have. He requires us to pre&s;ent our Selves, Soul and Body, a living Sacrifice, which is our rea&s;onable Service. We mu&s;t love Him with all our Hearts, laud Him with our Lips, and glorify Him in our Lives. We mu&s;t govern our Tho't, Words and Actions by his holy Law. We mu&s;t regard his Will, act for his Glory, &s;tudy his Plea&s;ure, prize his Favour, con&s;ult his Honour and Intere&s;t, fear to offend Him, and humble our &s;elves in deep Repentance, with Sorrow Fear and Shame, for every Sin whereby we have di&s;honoured and offended Him. We mu&s;t believe in HIM whom GOD hath &s;ent, looking for the Mercy of our LORD JESUS CHRIST unto Eternal Life. In all this we mu&s;t &s;hew our&s;elves his faithful <HI>Subjects.</HI> Deut. x. 12, 13, 14. <HI>And now I&s;rael, what doth the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD <HI>require of thee? but to fear the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD, <HI>to walk in all his Ways, and to love Him, and to &s;erve the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD <HI>with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul; to keep the Command|ments

<P N="2">2. The <HI>Works</HI> of the Lord are <HI>Great,</HI> and do declare his Greatne&s;s. He has made this <HI>great World</HI> which we behold: <HI>Made the Earth by his Power, and &s;tretched forth the Heavens by his Wi&s;dom.</HI> And his <HI>Providence</HI> which upholds and governs all declares Him to be very Great: P&s;alm. cxxxv. 5.6. <HI>For I know that the</HI> LORD <HI>is great, and that our</HI> GOD <HI>is above all Gods; What&s;oever the</HI> LORD <HI>plea&s;eth that doth He in Heaven, on Earth, in the Seas and in all deep Places: He cau&s;eth the Vapours to a&s;cend from the Ends of the Earth, He maketh Lightnings for the Rain, He bringeth the Wind out of his Trea&s;uries.</HI> Dan. iv. 3. <HI>How Great are his Signs! and how mighty his Wonders!</HI> As the Heavens for Height, and as the Earth for Depth, &s;o is the Greatne&s;s of this King un&s;earchable.</P>
<P N="1">1. He is the <HI>Great King,</HI> for He is the <HI>King eternal, and immortal.</HI> This is the Glory a&s;cribed to Him, 1 Tim. i. 17. And a great Glory it is, and declares Him to be a great King. <HI>Kings</HI> on Earth were born but t'other day, and they die to morrow.

It was <HI>High Trea&s;on</HI> again&s;t the MAJESTY <HI>on High.</HI> He has no <HI>Birth-day</HI> for us to keep in Honour to his Name! but there is the Birth-day of this <HI>World</HI> of ours, and of <HI>Man</HI> upon it, and there is a Day wherein He rai&s;ed up the SON OF MAN, <HI>the Prince of Life</HI> from the dead; and in &s;olemn Remembrance of The&s;e He commands us to &s;pend one Day in &s;even in Prayers and Prai&s;es to the Au|thor of our Being, the GOD of our Salvation. Thus it is that the <HI>Kingdom of our</HI> GOD, <HI>and the Power of His</HI> CHRIST is perpetuated and made glorious on Earth. Thus it is that we obey and an&s;wer to that Divine Call to us, P&s;alm xxiv. ult. <HI>Lft up your Heads, O ye Gates, and he ye lift up ye Everla&s;ting Doors, that the</HI> KING OF GLORY <HI>may come in.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In Reverence to GOD as the Great King of his Church, we awfully ob&s;erve the holy Ordinance of <HI>Bapti&s;m.</HI> He may en|joyn us what He will. Of old He gave to <HI>Abraham</HI> the Sign of Circumci&s;ion, and that day he circumci&s;ed Him&s;elf, his Son, and all the Men of his Hou&s;e. His Covenant was in their Fle&s;h for an everla&s;ting Covenant. When the Will of GOD was once declared, it had been high Pre&s;umption, a Contempt of His <HI>Ma|je&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> to have di&s;obeyed, tho' it was a humbling and painful In&s;titution. Exci&s;ion from God and from his People was the Penalty incurred. It was of &s;pecial &s;piritual Significancy to 'em; Deut. x. 16. <HI>Circumci&s;e the Foreskin of your Hearts.</HI> xxx. 6. <HI>And the</HI> LORD <HI>will circumci&s;e the Heart of your Seed to love Him, that thou maye&s;t live.</HI> In like manner, the &s;acred <HI>Sacramental Wa&s;hing with Water</HI> is &s;ignificant of a Soul &s;prinkled from an evil Con&s;cience. They are the Circumci&s;ion who wor&s;hip GOD in the Spirit. Bapti&s;m is now the <HI>Livery of the Great King,</HI> which his Servants wear to &s;ignify their Relation to Him, and Dedication to his Service. Matth. xxviii. ult. <HI>Go teach all Nations baptizing them.</HI> The KING of the Church was Him&s;elf baptized, and the Heavens opened on the illu&s;trious Occa&s;ion, and the SPIRIT de&s;cended as a Dove upon Him. The Mi&s;&s;ion of <HI>John</HI> was witne&s;&s;ed to from Heaven by the FATHER and the SPIRIT, and by the SON on Earth, <HI>He, the Elias of the New-Te&s;tament</HI> came baptizing with Water. It is a Solemnity much to be reverenc'd in the Chri&s;tian Church to the End of the
<PB N="16" REF="003645_0018_10023BC3B15C2F48">World. CHRIST'S Yoke herein is light, a Law of ea&s;y and plea&s;ant Ob&s;ervation; and he mu&s;t be very unrea&s;onable who like <HI>Naaman</HI> the Leper thinks much of the Injunction were it to wa&s;h <HI>&s;even times.</HI> 2 Kings v. 13.</P>
<P>In <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> we recognize our <HI>Seed</HI> as Subjects of CHRIST'S Kingdom. Did our Earthly King &s;ummon us to <HI>inrol</HI> our Names, and tho&s;e of our Children, that He might know Us and Them as Candidates for the Honours and Preferments of His Court, we &s;hould crowd it may be to enter our Names. Or &s;hould He &s;end us a <HI>Garter</HI> to wear in Token of his Favour and Grace to us, we &s;hould be proud to put it on. With like Gratitude &s;hould Chri&s;tians think of their <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> and bring their Offspring to the Waters.</P>
<P N="3">3. In Reverence and Obedience to the GREAT KING of the Church, we &s;hould be very careful in our Ob&s;ervation of the <HI>Lord's Supper.</HI> It is the Memorial of our CRUCIFIED KING, for &s;o ran the In&s;cription over his Cro&s;s, "JESUS <HI>of Nazareth King of the Jews</HI> Him hath GOD &s;et KING upon his holy Hill. He is LORD to the Glory of the FATHER. And as he went to his Cro&s;s he left us this Law, "<HI>This do ye in Re|membrance of Me.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame GOD and KING that requir'd of old the Ordinance of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over,</HI> has appointed now this of the <HI>Supper;</HI> to give Him the Glory of his <HI>Redeeming Love,</HI> and to receive from Him a publick Token and Pledge of it. Shall we refu&s;e? And &s;ay as in our <HI>Context," The Table of the Lord is contemptible!</HI> GOD fo bid. Is the Table of a great <HI>King</HI> &s;o accounted among Men? Do or dare Men refu&s;e to wait there, when required to do &s;o? Or do they not think it a great <HI>Honour</HI> and Plea&s;ure to be call'd up to it? And with what <HI>Reverence</HI> do they behave, who &s;tand about their Princes Table? How do they dre&s;s and prepare on &s;uch Occa&s;ion? Yet in Religion Men too often are the Rever&s;e of all this. The Ca&s;e and Crime is ju&s;tly re|pre&s;ented in the <HI>Parable</HI> of the KING that made <HI>a Marriage Supper</HI> for his SON, Matth. xxii. Init. But tho&s;e that were <HI>bidden</HI> made their paltry and criminal <HI>Excu&s;es,</HI> till the <HI>King was wroth</HI> and prote&s;ted they &s;hould never ta&s;te of his Fea&s;t. We read again of His coming in to &s;ee his <HI>Gue&s;ts,</HI> and how He chal|leng'd him that came without a <HI>Wedding Garment,</HI> and ca&s;t him out into utter Darkne&s;s. It teaches us the equal Irre|verence of tho&s;e that <HI>neglect</HI> and tho&s;e that <HI>profane</HI> the Ordi|nance of the <HI>Supper.</HI> Many wont come at all at the Call of their KING, and too many come carele&s;ly and without Reve|rence and Fear. The In&s;titutions of our GOD may be pro&s;tituted by Humane Laws, and many an unfit polluted Soul find him|&s;elf
<PB N="17" REF="003645_0019_10023BC5F83242D0">under an evil kind of Con&s;traint to approach them for carnal and filthy Ends: For the &s;ake of their daily Bread they may &s;ometimes unwillingly eat of the Bread of their GOD and drink of his Cup. And as long as partaking of the <HI>Sacrament</HI> is made a <HI>Te&s;t</HI> of Loyalty to our <HI>Earthly King,</HI> and a <HI>Qualification</HI> for Offices in Fleets and Armies, it will in this wicked World be nece&s;&s;arily profan'd to the Di&s;honour of the KING OF GLORY. HE has made it an <HI>Oath of our Allegiance to Him&s;elf,</HI> and we mu&s;t take and make it with godly Fear; <HI>Swearing</HI> to Him in Truth, in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and in Judgment. Has our GREAT KING &s;aid to us, "<HI>Do this in Remembrance of Me!</HI> And &s;hall we not do it? And He has &s;aid, Do it not <HI>unworthily!</HI> le&s;t ye <HI>eat and drink Judgment to your Selves.</HI> We &s;hould be equally deterred from the Neglect, and from the carele&s;s Performance of the Duty.</P>
<P>But this for the <HI>fir&s;t U&s;e,</HI> which an&s;wers to the mighty <HI>Rea|&s;on</HI> of the Words as they ly in our <HI>Context:</HI> Is GOD a Great KING? then with what <HI>Reverence and godly Fear</HI> is HE to be <HI>wor&s;hipped</HI> in one Ordinance of his Hou&s;e and in another? I &s;hall be <HI>&s;horter</HI> in the remaining <HI>Inferences.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Is GOD a Great King? <HI>how great is the Evil of the lea&s;t Sin!</HI> We mu&s;t ever e&s;timate the Evil of Sin from the Great|ne&s;s of the DIVINE MAJESTY. <HI>David's</HI> Heart &s;mote him for cutting off <HI>Sauls</HI> Skirt, &s;o &s;hould our Hearts &s;mite us for the lea&s;t Appearance of Sinning again&s;t the LORD our King. In every wilful Act of &s;in we are guilty of &s;tretching forth our Hand again&s;t the KING of Heaven, and &s;triking at his Crown and Government. Shall not <HI>Shimei</HI> die (&s;aid faithful <HI>Abi&s;hai</HI>) that has <HI>rail'd</HI> at and <HI>curs'd</HI> my Lord the King? We in Effect do <HI>this</HI> to the KING <HI>of Glory,</HI> and <HI>ca&s;t Stones</HI> at Him, in every &s;in we commit again&s;t the LORD OUR GOD. Shall a <HI>dead Dog</HI> do this and live! Sinners are <HI>no better</HI> before that BLESSED BEING whom their Sins bark at and bla&s;pheme. A light Repentance can never &s;uffice for the lea&s;t &s;in again&s;t the Di|vine Maje&s;ty. 1 Sam. ii. 25. <HI>If a Man &s;in again&s;t the</HI> LORD <HI>who can entreat for Him?</HI> What Atonement can be made for an infinite Offence? We read of &s;ome, who being doubly damn'd, <HI>do cur&s;e their</HI> GOD <HI>and</HI> KING, <HI>and look upward.</HI> I&s;ai. viii. ult.</P>
<P N="3">3. If GOD be a great King, He can <HI>greatly Pardon.</HI> And it is therefore a great Thing for Him to pardon the lea&s;t Sin. He cannot lightly pardon the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of his royal and perfect Law. The glorious Honour of his Kingdom forbids it. He cannot de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> Him&s;elf. But &s;aving the Rights of his own Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s, what cannot the Great King do?
<PB N="18" REF="003645_0020_10023BC867658E58"><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> well prayed, Numb. xiv. 17. <HI>Let the</HI> POWER <HI>of my</HI> LORD <HI>be great according as Thou ha&s;t &s;aid, the</HI> LORD <HI>is Long-&s;uffering and of great Mercy, forgiving Iniquity, Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and Sin. A|bi&s;hai</HI> wondered at <HI>David</HI>'s forgiving <HI>Shimei.</HI> But what was <HI>David</HI>'s Throne if compar'd with GOD'S. <HI>To the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD, <HI>belong Forgivene&s;&s;es.</HI> This is the <HI>Glory</HI> wherein he pa&s;&s;es before us Sinners.</P>
<P N="4">4. What a great thing is it, for the GREAT KING of Hea|ven, to give <HI>his</HI> OWN SON to &s;ave us! His <HI>Only-begotten and Eternal</HI> SON! <HI>the Brightne&s;s of his</HI> Glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on! by <HI>Whom He made the World, and by Him all things con&s;i&s;t.</HI> What manner of Love and Grace is this to Rebel du&s;t and a&s;hes! Had all the <HI>Angels</HI> in Heaven, and all the <HI>Kings</HI> upon Earth, been offer'd up in one Sacrifice, the&s;e glo|rious Lives had been as nothing in Compari&s;on of that &s;ingle Life of the SON OF GOD in our Nature. A LIFE worth all the&s;e ten thou&s;and times over.</P>
<P>It was accepted as a great thing by the GREAT GOD, when <HI>Abraham</HI> offer'd up his beloved <HI>I&s;aac</HI> to Him, at his Word, for a Burnt-Offering. But may we name it here? by no means. It was a more &s;urpri&s;ing thing and horrible, when the <HI>King of Moah</HI> driven to De&s;pair by the victorious Arms of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> took his <HI>Elde&s;t Son</HI> that &s;hould have reigned after him, and <HI>&s;lew</HI> him on the Wall of the City. A &s;alvage and bruti&s;h. Act! from Rage at his powerful Enemies, and worthy of their Dete&s;tation. But the Love of GOD in giving his <HI>Dear Son,</HI> to &s;ave his Enemies, is worthy of the Adorations of <HI>Angels</HI> and Men, while <HI>Devils</HI> gna&s;h their Teeth and melt away.</P>
<P N="5">5. What <HI>perfect Obedience</HI> is due from us to the <HI>Laws</HI> of the GREAT KING, and what <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to Him in all his <HI>Provi|dences!</HI> GOD is ab&s;olutely to be obeyed and &s;ubmitted to in all things. He is &s;o in Heaven and it &s;hould be &s;o on Earth. "<HI>Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</HI> It was a wi&s;e and righteous Order, given by the Greate&s;t Man on Earth, Ezra vii. 23, 26. <HI>What&s;oever is commanded by the</HI> GOD <HI>of Heaven, let diligently be done; for why &s;hould there be Wrath again&s;t us?</HI> GOD's <HI>Judgments</HI> mu&s;t be re&s;igned to with a perfect Acquie&s;cence. As <HI>Shimei</HI> an&s;wered to <HI>Solomon, "The &s;aying is good: As my Lord the King hath &s;aid, &s;o will thy &s;evant do.</HI> We are happy un|der a perfect Government. <HI>As for</HI> GOD, <HI>his Work is perfect.</HI> This is enough to keep us always ea&s;ie, thankful, joyful. <HI>Shall he that hateth Right govern, or is there Wickedne&s;s in the</HI> MOST HIGH? <HI>What Right have I (&s;aid injured Mephibe&s;heth) to cry
<PB N="19" REF="003645_0021_10023BCA01339E00">to the King?</HI> Our Times and Lives are in GOD's Hand. It is the LORD! let Him do what &s;eemeth him good.</P>
<P N="6">6. Is GOD a Great King? <HI>to him let us &s;wear and to Him perform our Vows.</HI> Becau&s;e He is the <HI>Greate&s;t</HI> we &s;wear by his Name, and He &s;wears by Him&s;elf. Jerem. iv. 2. <HI>Thou &s;hall &s;wear, "the</HI> LORD <HI>liveth! in Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s: and the Nations &s;hall ble&s;s them&s;elves in Him, and in Him they &s;hall glory.</HI> We mu&s;t &s;wear Allegiance and Fidelity to GOD, be|cau&s;e He is our <HI>King.</HI> So we have done in our <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> and &s;o we do <HI>as often as we eat of his Bread and drink of his Cup.</HI> The <HI>Sacraments</HI> of Religion are <HI>Oaths</HI> of Loyalty and Sub|jection to CHRIST. And in all our &s;olemn Prayers and <HI>Pro|fe&s;&s;ions,</HI> and occa&s;ional Vows, we bind our Souls, as by <HI>Oath,</HI> to GOD. "<HI>O my Soul, thou ha&s;t &s;aid unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>Thou art my</HI> LORD. This is the Demand of the GREAT KING, and his Glory requires it: I&s;ai. xlv. 23 <HI>I have &s;worn by</HI> MY SELF, <HI>that unto Me every Knee &s;hall bow, every Tongue &s;hall &s;wear.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Is GOD a Great King? there is certainly <HI>a Tribute</HI> due to Him out of all that we are and have: from our Minds and Hearts, from our Lips and Hands, out of our E&s;tates, and according to our Endowments and re&s;pective Stations. GOD is the King of <HI>Souls,</HI> and it is the Homage of the <HI>Heart</HI> that He requires and values. He gives us al&s;o our <HI>Wealth</HI> and claims an <HI>Offering</HI> out of that. "<HI>Honour the</HI> LORD <HI>with thy Sub&s;tance, and with the Fir&s;t-fruits of all thine Increa&s;e. Kings</HI> are thus &s;erved, yea &s;upported by their Subjects, and their <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> depends on it. But the GREAT KING receives but of <HI>His own</HI> from us, and what He fir&s;t gives to us. This, as was &s;aid before, is the <HI>Greatne&s;s and Glory and Maje&s;ty of His Kingdom, and His Exaltation above all:</HI> Both <HI>Riches and Honour</HI> come of Him, and in His Hand it is to <HI>make Great</HI> and to give Strength unto all! <HI>David</HI> therefore &s;pake before the LORD, in the Day when <HI>He</HI> and <HI>his Princes</HI> made their princely Of|ferings toward the <HI>Temple; But who am I, or what is my Peo|ple</HI> that We &s;hould offer any thing to the GREAT GOD? <HI>for all things come of Thee and of thine own have we given Thee.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Let us <HI>pray for, rejoice in,</HI> and every way we can <HI>contri|bute unto the Glory of</HI> GOD'S <HI>Kingdom.</HI> AS CHRIST has taught us to pray, "<HI>Father in Heaven thy Kingdom come!</HI> and to a&s;|cribe <HI>the Kingdom Power and Glory to</HI> GOD. O what an Ho|nour and Glory, Comfort and Joy will it be to us, if <HI>we</HI> may &s;erve to advance the Kingdom of CHRIST in this World and a better, Now and for Evermore! <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> in His <HI>Churches,</HI> mini&s;tring to the Conver&s;ion of Souls, and to their Subjection
