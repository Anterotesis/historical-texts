<P>The Thing which I greatly Feared, is come upon me.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THIS <HI>pre&s;ent Evil World,</HI> is full of Troubles; has in it a World of <HI>Evil. Every Day</HI> will bring a <HI>Sufficient Evil</HI> with it. All <HI>Sublunary</HI> Things are full of <HI>Changes.</HI> A Great part of our Duty, and Prudence in this World, is to be always ready for the <HI>Changes</HI> which may come upon us: There are <HI>Unknown Changes</HI> of Adver&s;ity to come up|on us. 'Tis of mighty con&s;equence, that none of tho&s;e <HI>Changes</HI> find us wholly unprovided for them: That our <HI>Changes</HI> may not &s;o &s;urprize us, as to find our Spirits altogether unable to En|counter them; That when our <HI>Changes</HI> arrive, our &s;urpri&s;ed Souls may not &s;ay, <HI>I never thought of &s;uch a Thing as this! I am wholly unable to grapple with it!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002560_0004_0FDB700886B9EC80">
OF this <HI>Piety,</HI> the Holy <HI>Job</HI> was a Notable and Glorious Example. There was of Old a Traditi|on in the Church of GOD; we find it in <HI>Origens</HI> Commentaries, that it was found, <HI>In Antiquorum dictis,</HI> that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> pre&s;ented the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in their <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Captivity; that they might read it in their Families, and encou|rage their Hearts in GOD under their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. We are yet more &s;ure, that in the <HI>Primitive Days</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> they Publickly read the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> on &s;orrowful occa&s;ions, and privately carried it al&s;o to one another on all &s;uch occa&s;ions. I do well at this Day, to take a Text from it. <HI>Job</HI> is afraid, That <HI>Piety</HI> would &s;ignify little to bring him <HI>out of Trouble;</HI> ina&s;much as it had not pre|vented his coming <HI>into</HI> Trouble. The <HI>Piety</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> while he was yet in his <HI>Pro&s;perity,</HI> is thus de&s;cribed unto us. He was not <HI>Secure;</HI> He did not fall into a Sleep of Security; He did not fall a&s;leep with a vain Dream, that no <HI>Changes</HI> of <HI>Ad|ver&s;ity</HI> would ever overtake him. He now &s;aw <HI>Mi&s;erable Changes:</HI> But the <HI>Changes</HI> did not come altogether Unlook'd for. <HI>The Thing which I great|ly feared;</HI> This pious <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> was not &s;uch an Anxious &amp; &s;uch a Tormenting <HI>Fear,</HI> as to take away his Ea&s;y, Plea&s;ant, Thankful Enjoyment of his Comforts. To live always in &s;uch a Di&s;qui|eting <HI>Fear</HI> of lo&s;ing what we enjoy, as to lo&s;e all comfortable Enjoyment of it, while we have it: this were no vertue in any Man; it were a <HI>&s;ore Judgment</HI> of GOD upon a Man. But the <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> was a <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Caution;</HI> a <HI>Fear</HI> that put him upon <HI>Sacrificing</HI> to GOD every Day; a <HI>Fear</HI> that
<PB N="3" REF="002560_0005_0FDB700A074075E8">caus'd him to entertain the <HI>Changes</HI> that came up|on him, with a Ready <HI>Re&s;ignation,</HI> and upon them to &s;ay, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the LORD!</HI> He could not fore&s;ee the particular <HI>Changes</HI> that hap|pened unto him: It was enough, That in the mid&s;t of his <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> he often thought, <HI>I do not know what may happen:</HI> And he did <HI>Fear</HI> the wor&s;t that could happen.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Le&s;&s;on of Piety</HI> to be now recommended unto us, is this;
<Q><HI>WE have Rea&s;on to Live in a continual Expecta|tion of Trouble&s;ome Changes; and make &s;uch a Religious Preparation for them, that we may be able &s;uitably to bear all the Troubles of our Changes.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IT will be our <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> to be <HI>always Ready</HI> for &s;orrowful <HI>Changes:</HI> to be in &s;uch a <HI>Readine&s;s</HI> for them, as may abate the Sorrows of the <HI>Changes.</HI> We may be at pre&s;ent in <HI>Pro&s;perity;</HI> or at lea&s;t we may have many <HI>Comfortable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions</HI> about us. Well, but we &s;hould have a <HI>Fear,</HI> that &s;ome <HI>Changes</HI> may be near unto us, a Devout <HI>Fear,</HI> that things will not continue long ju&s;t as they are; an Holy <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> which may produce in us a Temper, that &s;hall entertain what befalls us, with all due compo&s;edne&s;s of Mind, &amp; <HI>Re&s;ignation.</HI> We &s;hould be &s;o Apprehen&s;ive of all &s;orts of <HI>Changes,</HI> that whatever befalls us, we may be able, with &s;ome Quietne&s;s of Soul to &s;ay; <Q>'Tis no other than the <HI>Thing which I fear'd,</HI> that is come upon me; I am not <HI>&s;urpri&s;ed</HI> at it; It is no wor&s;e than what I have long been <HI>looking for.</HI></Q></P>
<P>OUR <HI>Duty &amp; Intere&s;t</HI> is di&s;po&s;ed into Two Ar|ticles;
<PB N="4" REF="002560_0006_0FDB700BDD837738">An <HI>Expectation</HI> of <HI>Changes,</HI> and a <HI>Prepara|tion</HI> for <HI>Changes.</HI> But the&s;e, as our <HI>Duty &amp; Intere&s;t</HI> them&s;elves, are &s;weetly <HI>Incorporated.</HI> They are very near to each other; They always <HI>go together;</HI> They are one and the &s;ame: Tho' they may be di&s;tinctly con&s;idered.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> WE have Rea&s;on to Live in a continual <HI>Ex|pectation</HI> of <HI>Trouble&s;ome Changes;</HI> To <HI>Fear Changes,</HI> as things that are very likely to come upon us.</P>
<P>WE will Enquire; Fir&s;t, What <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> have we to Live <HI>Expecting</HI> of <HI>Trouble&s;ome Changes?</HI> The Fir&s;t An&s;wer &s;hall be; Where <HI>do we Live?</HI> In|deed, if we were got &s;afe to <HI>Heaven,</HI> we were then got beyond all <HI>Trouble&s;ome Changes.</HI> Of them that are got out of this World, into a better, we read, Rev. XIV. 13. <HI>They Re&s;t from their Labours.</HI> Even &s;o, They <HI>Re&s;t from then Changes.</HI> When <HI>Death,</HI> which is our <HI>great Change,</HI> has come upon a Child of God, he &s;hall find it his <HI>Last Change;</HI> that is to &s;ay, the la&s;t that will have any Trouble in it. It is true, There is a <HI>Change</HI> to be Expected <HI>after Death;</HI> The <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Dead,</HI> will be a wondrous &amp; an Happy <HI>Change</HI> upon them. It is of that <HI>Change,</HI> that we read; Job 14.14. <HI>I will wait until my Change come.</HI> But the Saint &s;hall never &s;ee any <HI>Trouble&s;ome Change</HI> after <HI>Death.</HI> In the mean time, while we Live in <HI>this World,</HI> we are in a World full of <HI>Changes.</HI> Nothing in this World is <HI>Con&s;tant,</HI> but the <HI>Incon&s;tancy</HI> of the World. In the <HI>Natural World,</HI> there are continual Changes. We read; P&s;al. LXXIV. 16, 17. <HI>Day &amp; Night, Sum|mer &amp; Winter.</HI> And the <HI>Political World,</HI> has as many <HI>Changes.</HI> The <HI>Vici&s;&s;itudes</HI> in the World are ad|mirable. All things are in <HI>Motion.</HI> Things can|not
<PB N="5" REF="002560_0007_0FDB700BDFFA0900">continue long in <HI>one Po&s;ture.</HI> The condition of Things in this World, is compared unto that of <HI>Wheels.</HI> In the Vi&s;ions of the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> we have <HI>Wheels</HI> a&s;&s;igned unto all the <HI>Four Empires</HI> of the World; and all the <HI>Four</HI> Quarters of it. All Things are upon <HI>Wheels; Nations</HI> find it &s;o; And <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> find it &s;o. It is the Fate, both of <HI>Crowns</HI> and of <HI>Spades.</HI> The Victorious King of <HI>Aegypt</HI> had his Chariot drawn by Four Captive Princes. One of them kept looking very Atten|tively on the Wheels of the Chariot, and when the King <HI>Se&s;o&s;trys,</HI> ask'd him, What he &s;aw there; Sir, &s;aid he, <HI>I &s;ee, that what is now uppermo&s;t &s;oon becomes undermost! I &s;ee, 'tis a Rolling &s;ort of a World that we live in!</HI> Indeed, who &s;ees it not? It is not until the <HI>World to come,</HI> that we &s;hall Re|ceive the <HI>Kingdom that cannot be moved.</HI> While we are in &s;uch a World, we are mad, if we don't Expect <HI>Changes</HI> every Moment! Where is there any one Per&s;on free from this <HI>Common Lot</HI> of the World! The Experience of all the Men in the World, cries aloud unto us: <Q><HI>Behold, Changes! Changes upon all the World!</HI></Q> In this univer&s;al <HI>Experience,</HI> we may &s;ee <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> enough to Expect <HI>Changes</HI> upon us. <HI>Man,</HI> Why &s;houlde&s;t thou Ex|pect an Exemption from the <HI>Common Lot</HI> of the World!</P>
<P>BUT then, Secondly. Our <HI>Sin,</HI> makes us De|&s;erve <HI>Trouble&s;ome Changes;</HI> it makes us worthy of all &s;orts of <HI>Troubles.</HI> Man was at fir&s;t created a <HI>Changeable Creature:</HI> It was fit he &s;hould be &s;o. This was the occa&s;ion of his fir&s;t <HI>Falling into Sin.</HI> Since our <HI>Fall into Sin,</HI> we are now obnoxious to
<PB N="6" REF="002560_0008_0FDB7011D0DE1D80">all kinds of <HI>Trouble&s;ome Changes.</HI> Our <HI>Changes</HI> are part of the <HI>Death,</HI> which is the <HI>Wages of Sin.</HI> It it becau&s;e we have Sinned, that we make that Complaint, Job X. 17. <HI>Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t me, &mdash; Indignation upon me, &mdash; Changes again&s;t me.</HI> Our <HI>Changes</HI> are oftentimes <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> of the Divine <HI>In|dignation</HI> again&s;t us, for our Follies We do <HI>Change our Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">.</HI> We For&s;ake the <HI>Unchangeable GOD.</HI> We pur&s;ue a <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in Objects, which are &s;o liable to <HI>Changes,</HI> that they cannot <HI>Satisfy.</HI> We mu&s;t Expect that we &s;hall be <HI>Pun|i&s;hed</HI> with <HI>Changes. Changes</HI> with <HI>Troubles,</HI> how proper a <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> are they for us! We are at|tended with no <HI>Comforts,</HI> but we are too <HI>Unthank|ful</HI> for them, we are too <HI>Unfruitful</HI> with them, we grievou&s;ly <HI>Forfeit</HI> them. We may ju&s;tly Ex|pect <HI>Changes</HI> every day, to take away tho&s;e <HI>Com|forts,</HI> which we don't improve to the Glory of GOD, as we ought to do.</P>
<P>Thirdly. TO <HI>Expect Changes,</HI> is the way to <HI>Prevent Changes,</HI> that they &s;hall not come, or to <HI>Sweeten Changes,</HI> when they come. It is often &s;o, That the <HI>Expectation</HI> of <HI>Changes,</HI> proves our <HI>Deli|verance</HI> from them. Tho' the World u&s;ually proves <HI>wor&s;e than we hope,</HI> yet it u&s;ually proves al&s;o <HI>Better than we fear.</HI> 'Tis true, <HI>Job</HI> could &s;ay, <HI>The Thing which I greatly feared, is come upon me.</HI> But then, he &s;peaks of the ca&s;e, as a <HI>Rare ca&s;e;</HI> he wonders at it, that it &s;hould be &s;o. 'Tis mo&s;t frequently otherwi&s;e; The <HI>Changes</HI> which we mo&s;t <HI>Expect,</HI> are tho&s;e that we mo&s;t frequently <HI>E&s;cape.</HI> It may be, our <HI>Fear</HI> puts us on tho&s;e <HI>Me|thods of Safety,</HI> that &s;ave us from our <HI>Feared Changes.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="002560_0009_0FDB7013074AB300">If we were upon the Stroke of <HI>Progno&s;tication,</HI> would we mo&s;t probably <HI>Progno&s;ticate,</HI> what <HI>Chan|ges</HI> a Man &s;hall have befalling of him? I know not a more probable Rule of Conjecture than this; <HI>What is the Mans greate&s;t Point of Security?</HI> The Thing that a Man does lea&s;t of all <HI>Fear,</HI> 'tis <HI>great|ly to be Feared,</HI> that this is the Thing that is to come upon him. We read, P&s;al. XXX. 6, 7. <HI>I &s;aid, I &s;hall never be moved, &mdash; Thou hidde&s;t thy Face, and I was troubled.</HI> What is the Thing that a Man has lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion to &s;ee <HI>Moved?</HI> It is very likely, That is the very Thing, which he &s;hall &s;ee <HI>moved &amp; changed,</HI> and be <HI>Troubled.</HI> Or, if <HI>Expectation</HI> will not <HI>keep off</HI> our <HI>Changes,</HI> but the <HI>Thing which we greatly fear</HI> mu&s;t come upon us, yet it will <HI>moderate</HI> and <HI>mollify</HI> our <HI>Troubles,</HI> in our <HI>Changes. Tela Praevi&s;a minus feriunt.</HI> By being <HI>Fore-warn'd</HI> of our <HI>Changes,</HI> we are <HI>Fore-arm'd</HI> for them. Our Spirits being afore-hand a little <HI>Fa|miliariz'd</HI> unto our <HI>Changes,</HI> will be when they come, the le&s;s Affrighted at them. We le&s;s com|plain of tho&s;e things, which we know, are to be <HI>look'd</HI> for. The <HI>Wound</HI> is the le&s;s, when the <HI>Dart</HI> was <HI>Look'd for.</HI> The Expectation of <HI>Changes</HI> will fortify us, with <HI>Patience</HI> to bear them the more ea&s;ily &amp; hand&s;omely. The Me&s;&s;enger of <HI>Death</HI> put the famous Martyr into no Di&s;turbance, for, &s;aid, he, <HI>This is no other than what I have been this long while Daily Looking for!</HI></P>
<P>WE will Enquire, Secondly; <HI>What</HI> are the <HI>Trouble&s;ome Changes,</HI> which we mu&s;t Live in a daily <HI>Expectation</HI> of! The An&s;wer to this mu&s;t be very General. <HI>Of all in General;</HI> Becau&s;e no

<P>WHATEVER our <HI>E&s;tates</HI> may be, do not pre&s;ume, That it is impo&s;&s;ible for us, to be &s;tript of the&s;e <HI>E&s;tates.</HI> A <HI>Job,</HI> a Rich, and a Great Man, may &s;oon be <HI>Poor to a Proverb.</HI> Tho' we may &s;wim in <HI>Riches,</HI> yet we mu&s;t live in this Expecta|tion; <HI>The&s;e Riches may &s;oon take them&s;elves wings, and flee away.</HI> We are guilty of <HI>Trusting in Un|certain Riches,</HI> if we lay a&s;ide all &s;uch Expectation.

I &s;hall &s;ink, I &s;hall &s;ink, under my Loads.</HI> There are yet more that gives way to this; <HI>I am Afraid, I &s;hall not be able to look Death in the Face with any Courage; I am Afraid, my Dying Agonies will be Intolerable.</HI> But, Oh!

<P>Thirdly; BY &s;ome Souls that have the <HI>Evi|dent Tokens of Salvation</HI> upon them, it is a Thing that is <HI>Greatly Feared, I &s;hall Mi&s;carry after all, and my Portion will be that of the Hypocrites.</HI> But, be not <HI>Afraid,</HI> O Soul always doing &amp; &s;howing the <HI>Things that accompany Salvation;</HI> This is a Thing that will never come upon thee. Our SAVIOUR &s;aid unto &s;ome, Luk.

<P><HI>II.</HI> THERE are &s;ome Things which are the <HI>wor&s;t of Evils;</HI> and the <HI>Uncertainty</HI> of E&s;caping them, renders things <HI>Greatly to be Feared:</HI> Such a <HI>Fear</HI> of the&s;e things, as may prevent them, is to be commended unto us. To <HI>Fear</HI> tho&s;e Things is the way to E&s;cape them. And with regard unto &s;uch Things, it is the Direction of Heaven to us, 1 Pet.
