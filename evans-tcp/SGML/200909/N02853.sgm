<L>THE News, that <HI>Bacon</HI> was departed,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT, tho' <HI>Nat</HI>'s dead, yet &s;ad Di&s;traction,</L>

<L>To try if he could &s;tem the Tide,</L>
<L>Of Trea&s;on, and ambitious Pride,</L>
<L>That like a &s;udden Inundation,</L>
<L>Had drove him from his Habitation.</L>

<L>HE then conceiv'd, the &s;ure&s;t Way</L>

<LG>
<L>LIKE <HI>Lewis, Smith</HI> with many Men</L>
<L>March'd out, and then run back again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW comes the Trick of Captain <HI>Gran|tham,</HI></L>
<L>Which &s;ome think ba&s;e; but I think hand|&s;ome:</L>
<L>He long had traded in the Parts,</L>
<L>Knew Planters Tempers and their Hearts;</L>
<L>And had great Infl'ence far and near,</L>
<L>Either for Int're&s;t, Love, or Fear;</L>
<L>As many worthy Traders have,</L>
<L>Who in their Hands &s;till keep the Staff;</L>
<L>By keeping Planters Egg in Ne&s;t,</L>
<L>Pray don't be Mad, 'tis but a Je&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS Captain, cut out for the Work,</L>
<L>I'th Nick of Time arriv'd in <HI>York;</HI></L>
<L>And privately on WILL attending,</L>
<L>Got Management o'th Cau&s;e depending;</L>
<L>For WILL and he together lay</L>
<L>Their Heads, the <HI>Traytors</HI> to betray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN under <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> they had agreed,</L>
<L>To <HI>Ingram, Grantham</HI> goes with Speed,</L>
<L>To try what could be done by Skill,</L>
<L>Since Arms had fail'd i'th Cau&s;e of WILL.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>GRANTHAM,</HI> a nat'ral Rhetorician,</L>
<L>A Merchant, Tar, and Politician,</L>
<L>Did try with Words, as &s;mooth as Oil,</L>
<L>If he could &s;tubborn <HI>Ingram</HI> foil,</L>
<L>And <HI>Walkett,</HI> both to Rea&s;on bring;</L>
<L>'Who taking Arms again&s;t the King,</L>
<L>'Had Lives and Fortunes forfeited,</L>
<L>'And were in Law already dead:</L>
<L>'As <HI>Grantham</HI> told them; adding further,</L>
<L>'He really thought it wilful Murder</L>
<L>'To kill poor Subjects, on Pretence</L>
<L>'Of &s;tanding in their own Defence;</L>
<L>'Which could not be, &s;ince (as he heard)</L>
<L>'They by <HI>Nat</HI>'s Compa&s;s blindly &s;teer'd;</L>
<L>'So if their Cour&s;e they would not alter,</L>
<L>'They'd &s;oon be moar'd to Tree, by Halter:</L>
<L>'So begg'd them well to weigh the Ca&s;e,</L>
<L>'And Mercy by all Means embrace,</L>
<L>'Whil&s;t certain Mercy could be found,</L>
<L>'Before the Men of War &s;truck Ground,</L>
<L>'With Men 'tixt Decks, and Arms i'th Hold,</L>
<L>'Chuck-full, like <HI>Grecian</HI> Hor&s;e of Old'.</L>
<L>Thus he advis'd them to &s;ubmit</L>
<L>To <HI>Government,</HI> if they thought fit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AT this, they both began to look</L>
<L>As if they had been Thunder-&s;truck,</L>

<L>'Since you dead-hearted &s;eem to be,</L>
<L>'I will with BERKLEY &s;tand your Friend,</L>
<L>'Who to reque&s;t may conde&s;cend,</L>
<L>'(Perhaps) a piteous Ear to lend:</L>

<L>Well knowing that he had to do</L>
<L>With Runaways and Freemen too.</L>
<L>At length he &s;aith; 'Good Gentlemen,</L>

<LG>
<L>TO this they &s;oon unan'mou&s;ly</L>

<L>With Vapours cold and mi&s;ty Air,</L>
<L>To Fire-&s;ide I did repair;</L>
<L>Near which a jolly Female Crew,</L>
<L>Were deep engag'd at <HI>Lanterloo,</HI></L>
<L>In Nightrails white, with dirty Mien,</L>
<L>Such Sights are &s;carce in <HI>England</HI> &s;een;</L>
<L>I thought them fir&s;t &s;ome Witches, bent</L>
<L>On black De&s;igns, in dire Convent;</L>
<L>'Till one who with affected Air,</L>
<L>Had nicely learn'd to Cur&s;e and Swear,</L>
<L>Cry'd, <HI>Dealing's lo&s;t, 'tis but a Flam,</HI></L>
<L>And vow'd by G&mdash; <HI>&s;he'd have her Pam:</HI></L>
<L>When Dealing thro' the Board had run,</L>
<L>They ask'd me kindly, <HI>to make one:</HI></L>
<L>Not &s;taying often to be bid,</L>
<L>I &s;ate me down as others did;</L>
<L>We &s;carce had play'd a Round about,</L>
<L>But that tho&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Frows fell out:</L>
<L><HI>D&mdash;m you,</HI> &s;ays one, <HI>tho' now &s;o Brave,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I knew you late a Four Years Slave,</HI></L>
<L><HI>What, if for Planter's Wife you go,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nature de&s;ign'd you for the Hoe:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Rot you,</HI> replies the other &s;treight,</L>
<L><HI>The Captain ki&s;s'd you for his Freight;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And if the Truth was known aright,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And how you walk'd the Streets by Night,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You'd blu&s;h, if one could blu&s;h for Shame,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who from</HI> Bridewell <HI>and</HI> Newgate <HI>came.</HI></L>
<L>From Words they fairly fell to Blows,</L>
<L>And being loth to interpo&s;e,</L>
<L>Or meddle in the Wars of Punk,</L>
<L>Away to Bed in Ha&s;te I &s;lunk:</L>
<L>Waking next Day with aking Head,</L>
<L>And Thir&s;t that made me quit the Bed,</L>
<L>I rigg'd my &s;elf and &s;oon got up,</L>
<L>To cool my Liver with a Cup</L>
<L>Of <HI>Succahanah</HI> fre&s;h and clear,</L>
<L>Not half &s;o good as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer,</L>
<L>Which ready &s;tood in Kitchin Pail,</L>
<L>And was, in Fact, but <HI>Adam</HI>'s Ale.</L>

<L>FOR Planters Cellars, you mu&s;t know,</L>
<L>Seldom with good <HI>October</HI> flow,</L>
<L>But Perry, Quince, and Apple Juice,</L>
<L>Spout from the Tap, like any Sluice,</L>
<L>Until the Cask grows low and &s;tale,</L>
<L>They're forc'd again to Goard and Pail,</L>
<L>The &s;oothing Draught &s;carce down my Throat,</L>
<L>Enough to &s;et a Ship on float,</L>
<L>With <HI>Cockerou&s;e</HI> as I was &s;itting</L>
<L>I felt a Fever intermitting,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="003407_0026_1003EEAC5EB4D318">
A fiery Pul&s;e beat in my Veins,</L>
<L>From cold I felt re&s;embling Pains;</L>
<L>This cur&s;ed Sea&s;oning I remember,</L>
<L>La&s;ted from <HI>March</HI> 'till cold <HI>December;</HI></L>
<L>Nor could it then it's Quarter &s;hift,</L>
<L>Until by <HI>Carduus</HI> turn'd adrift:</L>
<L>And had my Doct're&s;s wanted Skill,</L>
<L>Or Kitchin-Phi&s;ick at her Will,</L>
<L>My Father's Son had lo&s;t his Lands,</L>
<L>And never &s;een the <HI>Goodwin Sands:</HI></L>
<L>But Thanks to <HI>Fortune,</HI> and a Nur&s;e,</L>
<L>Who&s;e Care depended on my Pur&s;e,</L>
<L>I &s;aw my &s;elf in good Condition,</L>
<L>Without the Help of a Phi&s;ician:</L>
<L>At length the &s;hivering Ill reliev'd</L>
<L>My Heart and Head, which long had griev'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I then began to think with Care,</L>
<L>How I might &s;ell my <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ware;</L>
<L>That with my Freight I might comply,</L>
<L>Did on my Charter-Party lye:</L>
<L>To this Intent, with Guide before,</L>
<L>I tript it to the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Shore;</L>
<L>Where riding near a Sandy Bay,</L>
<L>I met a Planter in my Way,</L>
<L>A pious, con&s;ciencious Rogue,</L>
<L>As e're wore Bonnet, Hat, or Brogue,</L>
<L>Who neither &s;wore, nor kept his Word,</L>
<L>But cheated in the Fear o' th' Lord;</L>
<L>And when his Debts he could not pay,</L>
<L>From tru&s;ting Fools he'd run away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH this &s;ly Zealot, &s;oon I &s;truck</L>
<L>A Bargain, for my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Truck,</L>
<L>Agreeing for Ten Thou&s;and Weight</L>
<L>Of <HI>Sotweed</HI> good, and fit for Freight:</L>
<L>Broad <HI>Oronoko,</HI> bright and &s;ound,</L>
<L>The Growth and Product of his Ground;</L>
<L>In Cask, that &s;hou'd contain compleat</L>
<L>Five Hundred of Tobacco neat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Contract thus betwixt us made,</L>
<L>Not well acquainted with the Trade,</L>
<L>My Goods I tru&s;ted to the Cheat,</L>
<L>Who&s;e Crop was then o'board the Fleet;</L>
<L>And going to receive my own,</L>
<L>I found the Bird was newly flown:</L>
<L>Cur&s;ing this execrable Slave,</L>
<L>This damn'd pretended Godly Knave,</L>
<L>On due Revenge and Ju&s;tice bent,</L>
<L>I in&s;tantly to Council went;</L>
<L>Unto an ambodexter Quack,</L>
<L>Who learnedly had got the Knack</L>
<L>Of giving Cly&s;ters, making Pills,</L>
<L>Of filling Bonds, and forging Wills;</L>
<L>And with a Stock of Impudence,</L>
<L>Supply'd his want of Wit and Sence,</L>
<L>With Looks demure, amazing People,</L>
<L>No wi&s;er than a Daw on Steeple</L>
<L>My Anger flu&s;hing in my Face,</L>
<L>I &s;tated the preceeding Ca&s;e,</L>
<L>And of my Money was &s;o free</L>
<L>That he'd have poi&s;on'd you or me,</L>
<L>And hang'd his Father on a Tree,</L>
<L>For &s;uch another tempting Fee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SMILING, &s;aid he, the Cau&s;e is clear,</L>
<L>I'll manage him, you need not fear,</L>
<L>The Ca&s;e is judg'd, good Sir, but look</L>
<L>In <HI>Galen,</HI> no, in my Lord <HI>Cook,</HI></L>
<L>I vow to G-d, I was mi&s;took:</L>
<L>I'll take out a Provincial Writ,</L>
<L>And trownce him for his knavi&s;h Wit,</L>
<L>Upon my Life, I'll win the Cau&s;e,</L>
<L>With as much Ea&s;e I cure the Yaws:</L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd to plague the Holy Brother,</L>
<L>I &s;et one Rogue to catch another.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TO try the Cau&s;e then fully bent,</L>
<L>Up to <HI>Annapolis</HI> I went,</L>
<L>A City &s;ituate on a Plain,</L>

<L>And if the Truth I may report,</L>
<L>It's not &s;o large as <HI>Tottenham-Court.</HI></L>
