</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE prophecies contained in this chapter, as well as in the forego|ing, and two following, relate chiefly to the happy deliverance of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from the land of their captivity, and their re&s;toration to the enjoyment of the in&s;titutions of God's wor&s;hip, and of all the rights and privileges of his peculiar people in their own land. And becau&s;e the de&s;ign of God in deli|vering his own people into captivity, was to reform and purge them from their &s;ins, e&s;pecially from their idolatries, which had been very provoking to him,
<PB N="2" REF="003886_0004_10020B8A42C63C50">and again&s;t which he te&s;tified his di&s;plea&s;ure in that awful di&s;pen&s;ation; therefore in the predictions and promi&s;es of their return out of captivity, we find fre|quent intimations of a &s;ignal work of repentance, that &s;hould be wrought in them, to prepare and qualify them for &s;o great a mercy, that before their return to their own <HI>land,</HI> and in order to it, they &s;hould fir&s;t penitently return to the <HI>Lord their God,</HI> from their &s;ins and idols, with humiliation &amp; &s;upplication; that God being reconciled to his people upon their repen|tance, might with honour to him&s;elf, appear for them as remarkably in works of mercy, as ever he had ap|pear'd again&s;t them in works of judgment. For a <HI>&s;pecimen,</HI> or proof hereof, let it &s;uffice to cite one pa&s;&s;age, &amp; that parallel to our context Jer. 50. 4, 5. <HI>In tho&s;e days, and in that time, &s;aith the Lord the chil|dren of I&s;rael &s;hall come, they &amp; the children of</HI> Judah, <HI>together, going and weeping: they &s;hall go, and &s;eek the Lord their God. They &s;hall ask the way to</HI> Zion, <HI>with their faces thitherward,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>come and let us join our&s;elves to the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. And it is ob&s;ervable, that the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> are there joined with the children of <HI>Judah</HI> in their return to God, &amp; &s;eeking the way to <HI>Zion;</HI> for it is a mi&s;take to think, that only the tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Benjamin</HI> return'd out of cap|tivity; for there were many of the ten tribes that a&s;&s;ociated with the two tribes in their return from <HI>Babylon.</HI> Particularly, we read 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> ix. 3 of <HI>the children of</HI> Ephraim, <HI>and</HI> Mana&s;&s;eh, that <HI>dwelt in Je|ru&s;alem</HI> after the captivity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Dr. PRIDEAUX <HI>Connect.</HI> Part 1. Book 3.</NOTE>. Therefore in our text, where the &s;ame work of repentance is foretold, and exemplify'd, and on the &s;ame occa&s;ion, and in order to the &s;ame happy i&s;&s;ue of the troubles of God's peo|ple, here promis'd, <HI>Ephraim</HI> is brought in <HI>bemoaning him&s;elf,</HI> &amp;c If it be ask'd, why <HI>Ephraim,</HI> rather than <HI>Judah?</HI> I can give no account, unle&s;s it be for one
<PB N="3" REF="003886_0005_1002678DDAA2FC28">or other of the&s;e rea&s;ons, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e, that as the kingdom of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> is often denominated in the prophets from <HI>Ephraim</HI> the ruling tribe; &s;o <HI>Ephraim</HI> fir&s;t open|ly, &amp; profe&s;&s;edly revolted to idolatry in the &s;eparation of the ten tribes from the hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> under <HI>Je|roboam,</HI> and idolatry being the &s;pecial &s;in that pro|vok'd God to ca&s;t his people out of the land he had given them, it being a breach of the marriage cove|nant between God and them, and <HI>Ephraim</HI> being in a &s;pecial manner guilty of this &s;in, <HI>he</HI> therefore e&s;pe|cially, is brought in exerci&s;ing repentance for it: and this may be the meaning of that penitent reflection in the following ver&s;e. <HI>I was a&s;hamed, yea even con|founded becau&s;e I did bear the reproach of my youth.</HI> Which may be under&s;tood of this &s;in of idolatry, which was the &s;in of the ten tribes from their <HI>youth,</HI> from their very beginning, when they were fir&s;t form'd into a kingdom, and which was indeed their reproach and ruin. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e in the ver&s;es immediately preceeding, a promi&s;e is made for the comfort of <HI>Rachel</HI> particularly, mourning bitterly for the lo&s;s of her children, that they &s;hould return <HI>from the land of the enemy,</HI> ver&s;e 15, 16, 17. therefore in the ver&s;es immediately following, the repentance of <HI>E|phraim</HI> who de&s;cended from <HI>Rachel,</HI> is particularly mentioned, &amp; God's acceptance of him to mercy de|clared, as that which prepared the way to the fulfil|ment of the promi&s;e of his deliverance &amp; re&s;toration. <HI>I have &s;urely heard</HI> Ephraim <HI>bemoaning him&s;elf,</HI> that is, the de&s;cendants of <HI>Ephraim:</HI> nothing being more u&s;ual in the prophets, than to put the name of the progenitor for his po&s;terity, as <HI>Jacob,</HI> for the children and po&s;terity of <HI>Jacob.</HI> And to go no farther than the context, Rachel <HI>weeping for her children,</HI> is put for the matrons in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> about the time of the captivity, who de&s;cended from <HI>Rachel.</HI> The peo|ple of God are here &s;poken of as a &s;ingle per&s;on un|der the name of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> to &s;hew that their repen|tance &s;hould be general, and that they &s;hould be
<PB N="4" REF="003886_0006_10026790531525A8">unanimous in it, and as Mr. HENRY ob&s;erves <Q>it is thus expre&s;s'd, that it might be the better accom|modated to particular penitents, for who&s;e directi|on and encouragement this pa&s;&s;age is intended.</Q></P>
<P>The words expre&s;s the language of a repenting &s;in|ner recommending him&s;elf to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mercy of God. He bewails his impatience, and incorrigiblene&s;s under the great and &s;ore calamities God had inflicted on him for his &s;ins, and in order to his amendment. <HI>Thou ha&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ed me, and I was cha&s;ti&s;ed as a bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke.</HI> Which &s;peaks either his need of cha&s;ti&s;ement; I was untractable, and not to be manag'd or govern'd by gentler methods, therefore I needed, and ju&s;tly de&s;erved this &s;evere correction; or rather it &s;peaks the effect of his cha&s;ti&s;ement; thus I was cha&s;ti&s;ed indeed, but behaved my&s;elf very un|towardly under it, as a <HI>bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke,</HI> I was not amended by it, but grew impatient and refractory under the yoke of afflictions; this he re|flects on now (when God had begun to mollify his heart) with humiliation for his pa&s;t contumacy: and hence he is convinced that the greate&s;t afflictions will not &s;uffice to bring a &s;inner to repentance with|out the effectual operations of divine grace, and con|fe&s;&s;eth it to God, as an argument, in pleading for that grace; which is the import of the petition that follows in the words of the text, <HI>turn thou me,</HI> &amp;c. wherein we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. A prayer for converting grace. <HI>Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned;</HI> it &s;peaks his &s;en&s;e of his own impotency to turn him&s;elf, his need of the grace of God to turn him, his dependance on that grace, and earne&s;t de&s;ire of it. <HI>Turn thou me,</HI> and then I &s;hall <HI>be turned</HI> q. d. if thou Lord wilt exert the power of thy grace, the effect &s;hall certainly follow, then I &s;hall be a&s;&s;uredly and effectually turned. Some ren|der the word actively, <HI>then I will return,</HI> &s;o it expre&s;&s;es
<PB N="5" REF="003886_0007_10026791D60BD068">his promi&s;e, or re&s;olution in a dependance on divine grace and &s;trength, quick'ning, exciting and a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, to return to God by repentance and reforma|tion: like that of the &s;pou&s;e, Cant. i. 4. <HI>Draw me, we will run after th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</HI> Or that of <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. cxix. 32. <HI>I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou &s;halt enlarge my heart.</HI> It comes to the &s;ame effect, whether we under&s;tand it pa&s;&s;ively or actively, for conver&s;ion and repentance is at la&s;t the &s;inner's own act, being fir&s;t quick'ned, moved, and inclined by the grace of God. And he that truly de&s;ires, and prays for converting grace, mu&s;t be under&s;tood to purpo&s;e and re&s;olve to repent, and turn to God in a dependance on that grace, to improve the grace given, and co-operate with it, in actual conver&s;ion from &s;in to God.</P>
<P N="2">2. An argument or plea to inforce this Petition, <HI>for thou art the Lord my God. Ephraim</HI> had been a very froward and undutiful child, had broken God's covenant by going after his idols, and God had laid him under the tokens of his di&s;plea&s;ure, exerci&s;ing him with very &s;ore cha&s;ti&s;ements, for his covenant violations; but he had not, as yet, utterly ca&s;t him off, nor di&s;&s;olv'd the covenant relation, he was &s;till <HI>beloved for the fath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r's &s;ake,</HI> with whom the covenant was fir&s;t made; and he improves this relation, as a plea in prayer for the mercy of the covenant, for grace, for converting grace. It may al&s;o denote his pre&s;ent choice, and acceptance of the <HI>God of I&s;rael</HI> for his God; he had been going a wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring after his idols, having for&s;aken the God of his fathers, but now having long &s;marted for his idolatry, grows &s;ick of his idols, loaths 'em, for&s;akes 'em, according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat prediction, Ho&s;. xiv. 8. <HI>Ephraim</HI> &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>what have I to do any more with Idols?</HI> and being by his di&s;tre&s;s reduced to a found mind, re&s;olves with the prodigal &s;on to <HI>go to his father;</HI> as tho' he had &s;aid, I acknow|lege my&s;elf to have been a &s;tubborn refractory child,
<PB N="6" REF="003886_0008_10026794ADF30408">and <HI>am no more worthy to be called thy &s;on;</HI> yea, de|&s;erve to be utterly ca&s;t off, and di&s;inherited, never|thele&s;s thou art my God, and father by covenant. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> own the relation, and de&s;ire to come up to the ob|ligation it lays me under to return to thee, and beg thy grace to enable me hereunto. I take thee the God of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> &amp; thee alone for my God, renouncing all fal&s;e gods, and devote my&s;elf to thee, and thy &s;ervice. This temper and di&s;po&s;ition God had pro|mi&s;ed to bring his people to, thereby to prepare them for mercy. Jer. iii. 19. <HI>I &s;aid, now &s;hall I put thee among the children, and give thee a plea&s;ant land,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and I &s;aid, thou &s;halt call me my father, and &s;halt not turn away from me.</HI> And if we take the word in the former clau&s;e, in the active &s;en&s;e, <HI>I will return,</HI> the&s;e words, <HI>for thou art the Lord my God,</HI> may be under&s;tood as an argument, which penitent <HI>Ephraim</HI> u&s;es with him&s;elf, to quicken his return to God; and &s;o he may be conceived to &s;peak to this effect, O my God, I have fooli&s;hly and wickedly departed from thee, yet thou ha&s;t &s;till the &s;upream right in me, and dominion over me, and I am &s;till under &s;olemn co|venant obligations to thee, as my rightful Lord, to obey and &s;erve thee; and my hope and dependance is on thee, as my &s;overeign benefactor, as my God in covenant, the portion of mine inheritance, there|fore will I return to thee. It &s;eems to be a compli|ance with that direction God gave his back&s;liding people, how to an&s;wer his call, and to addre&s;s him in their penitent return to him. Jer. iii. 22. <HI>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</HI></P>
<P>The in&s;tructions which the words afford us, may be reduc'd to the&s;e three heads, or points of doctrine.</P>

</LIST>
<P>It is the fir&s;t of the&s;e that I purpo&s;e chiefly to &s;peak to, the other two may be con&s;idered by way of inference, and motive, in the application of the doctrine.</P>
<P>Doct. I. <HI>That the converting grace of God is nece&s;|&s;ary to the effectual conver&s;ion of a &s;inner.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour here briefly to &s;hew, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What conver&s;ion is, or, when a &s;inner may be &s;aid to be <HI>turned. Secondly,</HI> The nece&s;&s;ity, &amp; victorious efficacy of the grace of God in the conver&s;ion of a &s;inner.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall &s;hew, <HI>what conver&s;ion is,</HI> or <HI>when a &s;inner</HI> may be &s;aid to <HI>be turned.</HI></P>
<P>It is a very har&s;h, and forc'd expo&s;ition which <HI>Grotius</HI> gives of the&s;e words, to this purpo&s;e, <HI>return thou me to my own country, and then I will repent:</HI> im|porting a pre&s;ent ob&s;tinate, incorrigible di&s;po&s;ition, contrary to the whole tenor of this pa&s;&s;age, which exhibits a mo&s;t humble, contrite, penitent frame, on the &s;inner's part: and the mo&s;t tender expre&s;&s;ions of pity and compa&s;&s;ion on God's part, of any that are to be met with in the whole &s;cripture. Unque&s;tionably therefore, the <HI>turning</HI> here intended, is no other than the conver&s;ion of the &s;oul from &s;in to God. And here, I need not tell you, that this &s;uppo&s;es a de|parture from God, a turning away from him, el&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="003886_0010_100267972B767ED0">there could be no room for &s;uch a duty as returning to him.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ion to God &s;uppo&s;es a &s;tate of degeneracy from him, which is the &s;tate of all mankind, fallen in <HI>Adam</HI> from their primitive integrity, and all have more or le&s;s departed from God by actual tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, and back&s;lidings. P&s;al. xiv. 2, 3 <HI>The Lord locked down from heaven upon the children of men: to &s;ee if there were any that did under&s;tand, and &s;eek God.

Jer. ii. 19 <HI>Know therefore, and &s;ee, that it is an evil thing, and bitter, that thou ha&s;t for|&s;aken the Lord thy God.</HI> Therefore in returning to God, he is to be con&s;ider'd as our &s;upream ruler, and benefactor, whom we have undutifully and perver&s;ly neglected and for&s;aken. Con&s;ider him in his natural relation to us as our creator, and as he exerci&s;es a do|minion over us by his providence, &s;o we can neither turn from him, nor to him, for <HI>in him</HI> we all <HI>live, and move, and have our being,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> xvii. 27, 28. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> cxxxix. 7, 8, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> good and bad. But con|&s;ider him in his moral character and relation, as an holy and righteous ruler, and a kind and gracious benefactor; &s;o we may be &s;aid to for&s;ake him by &s;in, and return to him by repentance, and obedience. We for&s;ake him as <HI>our &s;upream ruler,</HI> when we de|part from the rule of his commandments, either in heart or life, either by &s;ins of omi&s;&s;ion or commi&s;&s;ion, and in oppo&s;ition to his laws and precepts, are go|vern'd by our own corrupt inclinations and lu&s;ts. And we depart from him, as our <HI>&s;upream benefactor,</HI> when we pur&s;ue an imaginary felicity in the intere&s;ts
<PB N="9" REF="003886_0011_10026799A3240C48">and enjoyments of the world, apart from God, in the room of God, and in the neglect of God the creator, who is ble&s;s'd for ever. Jonah ii. 8 <HI>They that ob&s;erve lying vanities, for&s;ake their own mercy.</HI> Jer. xvii. 5. <HI>Cur&s;ed be the man that tru&s;teth in man, and maketh fle&s;h his arm, and whe&s;e heart departeth from the Lord.</HI> And therefore in returning to him, we mu&s;t own him as our <HI>&s;upream Lord</HI> and ruler, and turn from all our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and &s;inful deviations from his laws, un|to our duty and allegiance to him; &s;aying, as we are directed, I&s;ai. xxvi. 13 <HI>O Lord our God, other lords be&s;ides thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</HI> We acknow|lege none but thee for our rightful Lord, and law|giver. We mu&s;t renounce the dominion of &s;in and &s;atan, and take the will of God for our rule, and re|&s;olve to be ruled by it in everything. And we mu&s;t return to him, as our <HI>&s;upream benefactor,</HI> by renoun|cing the idols and vanities of the world, whereby our hearts have been alienated from him, and by taking him for our chief good, portioning our&s;elves in his favour, depending on him to pardon and ble&s;s us, and to communicate an all-&s;ufficient happine&s;s to us. In a word, we mu&s;t return to him as <HI>our Lord</HI> to rule, and as <HI>our God</HI> to make us happy.</P>
<P>And as to the requi&s;ites and ingredients in a &s;ound conver&s;ion, let me only note,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In the conver&s;ion of a &s;inner, there is a work of conviction and humiliation wrought in his &s;oul; whereby he is convinced of the evil, and damnable nature of &s;in; his carnal re&s;t is di&s;turb'd and broken, he finds him&s;elf de&s;erted of his earthly refuges, de|&s;pairs of relief from every creature to his wounded con&s;cience, and is heavy laden with a &s;en&s;e of guilt and corruption, which is the wormwood and gall that embitters all his comforts, and the &s;ting of all his afflictions, and fills his &s;oul with vexation and
<PB N="10" REF="003886_0012_1002679B24E8E9E0">terror, which excites in him a loathing of his &s;ins, and an earne&s;t de&s;ire to leave them, and to have no more commerce with them This work of humi|liation is nece&s;&s;ary to mortify the love of &s;in, and to break off the &s;inner's heart from it, to make the re|medy of God's grace and mercy in Chri&s;t, welcome to him on any terms, and to influence his inclina|tions and endeavours unto a ready compliance with all the methods of grace, &amp; the terms and conditions of &s;alvation. This is exemplify'd in the prodigal &s;on, who never tho't of returning to his father's hou&s;e, till reduc'd to the la&s;t extremity. Luk xv. 17, 18. <HI>When he came to him&s;elf, he &s;aid, how many hired &s;er|vants of my father have bread enough, and to &s;pare, and I peri&s;h with hunger: I will ari&s;e, and go to my father.</HI> And in tho&s;e three thou&s;and converted, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. who when they heard the word preached by <HI>Peter,</HI> with a clo&s;e application to their con&s;ciences, <HI>were pricked in their heart, and &s;aid, men and brethren, what &s;hall we do?</HI> And in <HI>Saul</HI> Act ix 6 <HI>he trem|bling and a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;aid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</HI> And the &s;ame temper, and contrition of &s;pirit is repre&s;ented in the in&s;tance before us, of a true penitent, ver. 19. <HI>After that I was in&s;tructed, I &s;mote upon my thigh: I was a&s;hamed, yea, even con|founded, becau&s;e I did bear the reproach of my youth.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In the conver&s;ion of a &s;inner, there is a change wrought in the temper, bya&s;s, and inclination of the &s;oul; turning it from &s;in to holine&s;s, from the crea|ture to God: it does not &s;uffice to conver&s;ion, that a &s;inner for&s;akes &s;ome &s;ins, that he lived in before.

<HI>Secondly,</HI> What has been &s;aid, <HI>&s;erves for conviction to tho&s;e that indulge a &s;ecret opinion of their own &s;uf|ficiency, and power to repent and turn to God when they plea&s;e.</HI> Such a conceit may be found with many, who yet have orthodox notions concerning man's impo|tency, and the nece&s;&s;ity of effectual grace. For the truth of this, I will appeal to the con&s;ciences of many, who under &s;trong convictions of the &s;inful|ne&s;s and danger of their condition, and of the nece&s;|&s;ity of conver&s;ion, to &s;atisfy con&s;cience re&s;olve that &s;ome time hereafter they will repent, yet for the pre&s;ent wilfully neglect the doing what they think they can do in order to conver&s;ion, and what they purpo&s;e &s;ome time or other to do. Now what does this argue, but that you think it is in your own pow|er to repent when you plea&s;e, without any more &s;pe|cial grace from God? otherwi&s;e it is a de&s;perate hazard you run, by putting off convictions, and de|ferring repentance, while the Spirit of God is &s;triving with you, le&s;t he depart, and return no more. And I am per&s;waded, if &s;inners would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider this, and believe it, they could not be ea&s;y in their wretched neglects and delays. Again, have you not, when lu&s;ts have been importunate, and temptations &s;trong, yielded to commit a &s;in again&s;t con&s;cience, and, it may be, again&s;t &s;olemn vows, with &s;uch a tho't as this, if I venture this once, it is but to repent, and all will be well. And does not this &s;uppo&s;e, that you think that repentance is at any time in your power, whether God gives you the grace of his Spirit or no? otherwi&s;e it is a fearful venture indeed, to provoke God to his face, by who&s;e grace alone, you mu&s;t be enabled to repent, if ever you do &s;o in &s;in|cerity. Therefore,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, Be deterr'd from &s;inning upon pre&s;umption of repenting;</HI> for this very rea&s;on, becau&s;e of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the grace of God, to thy repentance and conver&s;ion, which he is not bound to give. He may
<PB N="26" REF="003886_0028_100267B3AB428238">do it, and he may not, if he plea&s;e. If thou take&s;t the liberty of thy will to &s;in, God may take the li|berty of his will to deny thee grace, and leave thee to thine own hardne&s;s, and impenitent heart, to trea|&s;ure up to thy &s;elf wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> It may &s;erve <HI>to humble all, e&s;pecially un|converted ones, in a &s;en&s;e of the hardne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of their hearts by nature,</HI> that nothing can move or melt to a temper pliable to God's will, but the ef|fectual grace of the Spirit of God. Judgments can|not do it of them&s;elves, they may rouze and terrify, but without the gracious influences of the Spirit, will rather have an hardning efficacy. An unconverted &s;inner under divine cha&s;ti&s;ements, behaves <HI>as a bul|lock unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke.</HI> A me&s;&s;enger from the dead cannot do it. Luk. xvi. 31. <HI>If they hear not Mo|&s;es, and the prophets, neither will they be per&s;waded</HI> (i. e. to repent, <HI>ver.</HI> 30) <HI>though one ro&s;e from the dead.</HI> The mo&s;t awakening &s;ermons, the mo&s;t lively preach|ing cannot do it. All the <HI>former prophets</HI> could not &s;often and &s;ubdue the hearts of the men of their ge|neration. Zech. vii. 12. <HI>Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant &s;tone, le&s;t they &s;hould hear the law, and the words which the Lord of ho&s;ts hath &s;ent in his Spirit, by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of ho&s;ts I&s;aiah</HI>'s preaching did but make their <HI>heart fat, and their ears heavy,</HI> and clo&s;ed <HI>their eyes,</HI> that they did not <HI>&s;ee with their eyes,</HI> nor <HI>hear with their ears,</HI> nor <HI>under&s;tand with their hearts,</HI> that they might be <HI>converted,</HI> and <HI>healed, I&s;ai.</HI> vi. 10. that is, this was the effect of his preaching, thro' the hardne&s;s of the people's hearts. And thy heart is made of the &s;ame metal. If <HI>I&s;aiah, Jeremiah</HI> or <HI>E|zekiel</HI> were alive, there is hardne&s;s enough in thy heart to with&s;tand all their calls, expo&s;tulations, and warnings. Nay, if Chri&s;t him&s;elf were on earth a|gain, who is greater than all the prophets, if he
<PB N="27" REF="003886_0029_100267B6230E8C60">&s;hould weep over thee, as he <HI>wept over Jeru&s;alem</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luk.</HI> xix. 41.</NOTE>, he could not humble, &s;often, nor convert thine ob|&s;tinate heart, without exerting his omnipotent grace. Learn then, to <HI>know the plague</HI> of thine own heart<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>King.</HI> viii. 38.</NOTE>, and &s;eriou&s;ly bewail it before God.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Let it be improved for <HI>caution again&s;t a|bu&s;ing this doctrine of the nece&s;&s;ity of God's grace in the work of conver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>It is abu&s;ed, when men pretend it as an excu&s;e for their continuance in &s;in, or neglect of known duties; they hope to amend and do better, when God gives them grace; and thus, in a very impious man|ner, they lay the blame of their &s;ins, upon God's de|nying them grace. But know, O &s;inner, that thou art bound by the command, which requires nothing of thee, but what is &s;uited to the powers of thy rea|&s;onable nature; and thine impotency to do what is required, lies not in the want of natural faculties, but in an ob&s;tinate and perver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition of will, which is &s;o far from excu&s;ing thee from the duties of holine&s;s, that the neglect of them mu&s;t needs expo&s;e thee to the upbraidings of thine own con&s;cience. And the promi&s;e offers thee grace &s;ufficient in a &s;en&s;e of thine own impotency, and thou art forever inexcu&s;a|ble, if thou do&s;t not &s;eek it earne&s;tly, and u&s;e the ap|pointed means to attain it; but if you content your &s;elves in the &s;lothful neglect of what you may and can do in the u&s;e of means, you de&s;pi&s;e the grace of God, and forfeit the influences and a&s;&s;i&s;tances of it, and will peri&s;h as inexcu&s;ably, as if it had been ever &s;o fully in your own power to convert your&s;elves.</P>
<P>Again, It is abu&s;ed, when per&s;ons admit of di&s;|couragements from duties, becau&s;e they are uncer|tain,
<PB N="28" REF="003886_0030_10020BA719F9FA88">whether God will give them grace, and for that rea&s;on are di&s;couraged e&s;pecially from binding them|&s;elves with religious vows to an holy life, and taking upon them the obligations of their bapti&s;mal cove|nant, or joining them&s;elves in church fellow&s;hip, be|cau&s;e it is doubtful whether God will give them grace, which is nece&s;&s;ary to enable them to live up to their religious engagements.</P>
<P>But the apo&s;tle has taught us to rea&s;on quite the contrary way. Phil. ii. 12, 13. <HI>Work out your own &s;al|vation with fear and trembling, for it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good plea|&s;ure.</HI> He doth not &s;ay, becau&s;e <HI>it is God who works in you of his good plea&s;ure,</HI> therefore &s;it &s;till, and wait for the motions and operations of grace; no, but be encouraged hence to work, to &s;tir up your&s;elves, and put forth endeavours in working out your &s;alvation, never que&s;tioning the concurrence and powerful aids of divine grace; which are never wanting to &s;e|rious endeavours; and then be encouraged to hope for the &s;ucce&s;s of your endeavours, for if God works in you, and with you, your labour &s;hall not be in vain in the Lord. Wherefore give up your&s;elves to God, u&s;e the means of grace, you are then in the way of God's ble&s;&s;ing, make trial of his ways in good earne&s;t, depend on his promi&s;ed grace, and you &s;hall find it <HI>&s;ufficient</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 9.</NOTE> to carry you thro', as thou&s;ands have done before you, who have had no more a&s;&s;u|rance of God's grace than you, but they tru&s;ted God, and were helped, and found his grace &s;ufficient for them.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may &s;ay, if God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, then let me do what I will, or can, I may yet fall &s;hort of grace.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003886_0031_100267B7AE21A588">
But this is a prepo&s;terous way of rea&s;oning. 'Tis true I mu&s;t acknowledge, that God is at liberty to withhold his grace (for if it were due, it were not grace) and may ju&s;tly do it after all my endeavours, for my ill de&s;ervings, yet con&s;idering the general offer of grace to all, without exception, it is much more rea&s;onable, and more for the glory of God, and for the honour of his grace, to argue thus, Let me do what I can in the u&s;e of means, and I have no rea&s;on to de&s;pair of grace, and help from God, but rather much encouragement to expect it; and a &s;en&s;e of &s;in and unworthine&s;s &s;hould be no di&s;couragement, for he gives grace to none becau&s;e they are worthy, nor de|nies it to none meerly becau&s;e of their unworthine&s;s, for &s;o he &s;hould deny it to all; &s;ay then, Lord, I am a poor wretched creature, unworthy of a favourable look from thee, there is nothing in me to move thee to pity or help me, but my own wants and mi&s;eries; yet &s;ince thy grace is free to all, even the mo&s;t un|worthy, and thou ha&s;t mercy in a &s;overeign way on whom thou wilt, if therefore, Lord, thou wilt, thou can&s;t glorify thy mercy on &s;uch a vile unworthy object as I am, therefore will I wait on thee, and if I peri&s;h, I will peri&s;h at the foot&s;tool of thy grace. A &s;oul bro't into this humble yielding frame, is a fit object of the divine compa&s;&s;ions and grace. Jam. iv. 6, 7. He <HI>giveth grace unto the humble.

Wherefore in order to the inforcement of this exhortation, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew the&s;e two things,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That <HI>it is the unque&s;tionable duty of all unrege|nerate and unconverted ones to pray to God.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="32" REF="003886_0034_100267BD1FB61E48">
2. That <HI>it is their great concern to pray for conver|ting grace.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>it is the unque&s;tionable duty of all unregene|rate and unconverted ones to pray to God.</HI> Though they are &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;titute of &s;upernatural habits, and the indwelling pre&s;ence of the Spirit of grace and &s;upplication, that &s;hould frame their hearts unto this duty, in order to the acceptable performance of it, they are &s;till under indi&s;pen&s;able obligations to pray to God: and the more &s;inful and wretched their condition is, and the more &s;en&s;ible they are of their own vilene&s;s, and unworthine&s;s, the more need they have certainly, to bemoan them&s;elves to God, and pour out their hearts before him in prayer, for the &s;uccours of his mercy and grace.</P>
<P>That this is matter of plain duty, appears, in that prayer is a duty of wor&s;hip founded on the law of nature, the obligations whereof reach every man, be|ing of equal extent with the humane nature; this is a part of natural homage due from all rea&s;onable creatures to the God that made them, by the law of their creation, and dependance on him. P&s;al. c. 2, 3. <HI>Serve the Lord with gladne&s;s &mdash;. Know ye that the Lord he is God, it is he that hath made us, and not we our&s;elves.</HI> P&s;al. xcv. 6, 7, <HI>O come let us wor&s;hip, and how down: let us kneel before the Lord our maker. For he is our God, and we are the people of his pa&s;ture, and the &s;heep of his hand.</HI> It is highly rea&s;onable that de|pending creatures, endow'd with rea&s;on and under|&s;tanding, &s;hould in this way, own the &s;overeign au|thor of their beings, on whom they have a con&s;tant and nece&s;&s;ary dependance for life, breath, and all things. The neglect whereof therefore is a counter|acting the end of our creation, and a violation of the prime dictate of the law of nature. For prayer is a duty which natural con&s;cience requires of men, there is a natural reverence of God in the con&s;ciences of
<PB N="33" REF="003886_0035_100267BF97B32380">men that prompts them to this duty. The unen|lightned heathen, tho' mi&s;taken in the objects of their wor&s;hip, have yet ever tho't it their duty to pray to the gods they own'd. Thus tho&s;e pagan <HI>mariners</HI> in <HI>Jon.</HI> i. 5. in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing tempe&s;t at &s;ea, being taught, as it &s;hould &s;eem, by the meer voice of nature, <HI>cried every man to his god.</HI> And tho&s;e that neglect this part of God's wor&s;hip, are ju&s;tly con&s;trued to ca&s;t off the natural reverence of God. Job xv. 4 <HI>Thou ca&s;te&s;t off fear, and re&s;traine&s;t prayer before God.</HI> Moreover.</P>
<P>This duty is enforced by the plain po&s;itive com|mands of the word, often repeated, from the obliga|tion whereof no &s;ort of men can pretend exemption. Such as P&s;al. lxii. 8. <HI>Tru&s;t in him at all times, ye peo|ple, pour out your heart before him.</HI> I&s;ai. lv. 6. <HI>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye upon him, while he is near.</HI> Luk. xviii. 1. <HI>He &s;pake a parable to them to this end, that men ought always to pray and not to faint.</HI> 1 Tim. ii. 8. <HI>I will that men pray every where,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e &amp; the like commands which often occur in &s;cripture, enjoin the duty upon men indiffe|rently, without determining whether they be rege|nerate, or unregenerate, and are of equal extent with the law of nature obliging every man to pray. Again,</P>
<P>There are many gracious promi&s;es God has made to prayer, which are de&s;ign'd for the encouragement of &s;uch &s;inners, and do therefore greatly inforce their obligations thereunto; &s;uch as Prov. viii. 17. <HI>They that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me.</HI> Mat. vii. 7, 8 <HI>Ask, and it &s;hall be given you; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh, receiveth,</HI> &amp;c. i. e. every one, who&s;oever he be, that makes a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;erious importunate prayer, &s;hall undoubtedly find acceptance and &s;ucce&s;s in his pe|titions. I&s;ai. xlv. 19. <HI>I &s;aid not to the &s;eed of Jacob, &s;eek ye me in vain.</HI> And many others of the like im|portance,
<PB N="34" REF="003886_0036_100267C226D29940">which &s;hould encourage and per&s;wade all men, even the vile&s;t &s;inners to the practice of this duty; &s;o that their intere&s;t invites them, &amp; their ne|ce&s;&s;ities &s;hould drive them to their prayers. For con|&s;ider again, that the natural &s;tate of fallen man is a &s;tate of extream indigence: he is <HI>wretched, mi&s;erae|ble, poor, blind and naked,</HI> Rev. iii. 17. which calls aloud upon him to apply him&s;elf to the mercy of God by earne&s;t prayer for relief. Who of all the living do more need divine mercy and &s;uccour than unregenerate &s;inners? &s;o that their being &s;inners, and unregenerate, is &s;o far from excu&s;ing them from prayer, as a duty they are unfit for, that it &s;hews them the greater need they have to pray, to confe&s;s their iniquities, &amp; beg pardon of their offended Lord, and his grace and mercy to heal the maladies, and re|lieve the nece&s;&s;ities of their poor peri&s;hing &s;ouls. And let me add,</P>
<P>That God's affording to &s;inners a day of grace, and a &s;ea&s;on of trial in this world, for their eternal &s;tate, confirms their obligations to this duty, and &s;hould quicken them to the &s;peedy and &s;erious practice of it. Thro' the riches of God's goodne&s;s and for bear|ance, they are &s;till in the land of hope, in a &s;tate of trial, and expectation; their final condition is not yet determined, God hath not yet pa&s;s'd a &s;entence of rejection upon them, he doth not yet &s;ay unto them, <HI>tho' you cry unto me, I will not hear,</HI> &s;uch a &s;entence he will pa&s;s upon men, when he comes to deal with them in wrath, and to execute judgment without mercy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. <HI>i. 28.</HI> Mic. <HI>iv. 3.</HI></NOTE>. And this is the condition of tho&s;e poor &s;inners that are gone to their everla&s;ting &s;tate, tho' they cry never &s;o earne&s;tly for mercy, it will be all in vain, when their &s;tate of trial is over, and their opportunities of grace at an end, the bowels of God's
<PB N="35" REF="003886_0037_10020BAF245FDBF0">compa&s;&s;ions will be for ever &s;hut up again&s;t them. Many will at la&s;t cry with the greate&s;t vehemence and importunity, <HI>Lord, Lord, open to us,</HI> when it will be too late to prevail by their mo&s;t importunate en|treaties, the <HI>door</HI> of mercy being <HI>&s;hut</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xxv. 10, 11, 12.</NOTE>. But it is not &s;o with &s;inners in this time of trial and hope that God has mercifully afforded them in this world; the door of mercy is now open to the greate&s;t &s;inners, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e that enjoy the go&s;pel, and means of grace; they have the greate&s;t encouragement that can be de&s;ired to &s;eek God; he is near to them in the offers of his grace, and the &s;trivings of his Spirit, it is now a time when he may be found by humble, and diligent &s;eekers. God reveals him&s;elf to them on a mercy &s;eat, and the way to <HI>the throne of grace</HI> is open to them by the mediation of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is ready to befriend them by his agency, and in|terce&s;&s;ion with the Father. They have <HI>now an ac|cepted time,</HI> and day of &s;alvation<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 2</NOTE>; and their penitent &s;upplications may find acceptance with the God of mercy, as God <HI>heard Ephraim bemoaning him&s;elf,</HI> &amp;c. From all which con&s;iderations it appears, that &s;inners in a &s;tate of unregeneracy are under the plaine&s;t ob|ligations to pray to God.</P>
<P><HI>Object</HI> But it is &s;aid, <HI>without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God,</HI> Heb xi 6 And that <HI>the &s;acrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,</HI> Prov. xv. 8. therefore &s;ome may be ready to think that it is better to forbear a duty, than to contract new guilt by the performance of it.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w</HI> It is granted, that faith towards God, and the Mediator, is certainly nece&s;&s;ary to our plea&s;ing God in duties of wor&s;hip, e&s;pecially in prayer: and that the unregenerate not having a ju&s;tifying faith
<PB N="36" REF="003886_0038_100267C3B35459B0"><HI>cannot plea&s;e God,</HI> Rom. viii. 8. And further, it is true that &s;uch &s;inners as go on wilfully in a cour&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and rebellion again&s;t God, can't be tho't to pray acceptably, yea their prayers are an abomina|tion to him; for <HI>be that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer &s;hall be abomination,</HI> Prov xxviii. 9. But what does all this infer, but that whil&s;t men content them&s;elves in an unregenerate &s;tate, and live &s;ecurely in &s;in, and think by their for|mal &s;ervices and duties of wor&s;hip, to atone for their moral tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, they are the objects of God's di&s;plea&s;ure, and the more &s;o for their hypocri&s;y, and di&s;&s;imulation in their prayers and devotions. And this, &s;urely, is a very dangerous &s;tate not to be re&s;ted in &s;ecurely. But for a more direct an&s;wer to the ob|jection in a word or two,</P>
<P N="1">(1) If unregenerate &s;inners are bound to pray by the law of nature, and the expre&s;s commands of God's word, as has been prov'd, it is unrea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e, that their want of fit qualifications &s;hould make void their obligations thereunto; for then it would follow, that the profane&s;t &s;inners would be chargea|ble with no guilt, for their ungodly neglects of the plaine&s;t duties of God's wor&s;hip, as being under no obligation to them for want of &s;uitable qualifications; which is an open ab&s;urdity; yea, this very defect is their &s;in and fault, for what is it that may be &s;up|po&s;ed to render &s;inners unqualified, or unmeet for the duty of prayer? not meerly their being &s;inners; for the greate&s;t &s;inners praying to God in an humble, penitent, broken hearted manner, &s;hall, without doubt, find acceptance with him: but their being wilful re&s;olved &s;inners, &s;ecurely per&s;i&s;ting in &s;in, which is rather an aggravation of their guilt than any excu&s;e for their omi&s;&s;ion of God's wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="37" REF="003886_0039_100267C65B4287E8">
(2) It is equally their duty to <HI>repent, believe,</HI> and <HI>pray;</HI> as the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> directs <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> Act. viii. 22. <HI>Repent of this thy wickedne&s;s, and pray God,</HI> &amp;c. When &s;inners, therefore, are called upon to pray, it is not meant that they &s;hould pray without repen|tance towards God, and faith towards the mediator, but the&s;e graces are to be exerci&s;ed in prayer, we mu&s;t exerci&s;e repentance in humiliation, and confe&s;|&s;ion of &s;in, and faith in our &s;upplications for mercy in the name of Chri&s;t, which &s;ugge&s;ts another argument whereby this duty is enfore'd. For if it be the duty of &s;inners to repent and believe in Chri&s;t, as mo&s;t certainly it is, then it is unque&s;tionably their duty to pray, for the&s;e graces are to be acted in prayer, and every man that &s;ets him&s;elf to repent, or makes any offer towards it, will think it his duty to pray to God; 'tis one of the fir&s;t and main duties in which his own con&s;cience will direct him to exerci&s;e repentance. And there is no incongruity in calling upon &s;inners to exerci&s;e repentance and faith in their prayers to God for the grace of repentance, and conver&s;ion, becau&s;e the operations of divine grace are no other|wi&s;e to be expected, than in concurrence with our be&s;t endeavours in the u&s;e of the means of grace.</P>
<P N="3">(3) Tho' &s;inners be not at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate of ju&s;tification and acceptance with God, though they have not as yet receiv'd the <HI>Spirit of adoption,</HI> en|abling them to cry, <HI>Abba, Father;</HI> yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that it is much better and &s;afer for them to pray as well as they can, than wholly to neglect it. There is certainly a difference to be made between wicked men, or tho&s;e that are in an unregenerate &s;tate, in re&s;pect of their prayers; and it may truly be &s;aid, that the prayers of &s;ome &s;inners are more a|greable to the will of God, than tho&s;e of others. some pray only to cover their hypocri&s;y and wick|edne&s;s, and get e&s;teem among people; as the phari|&s;ees, who <HI>gave alms,</HI> and <HI>prayed, that they might be

Some pray in a formal manner, without any &s;erious de&s;ires to|wards God, meerly from a dictate of con&s;cience. Some pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for provi&s;ion for their lu&s;ts; they <HI>ask ami&s;s, that</HI> they might <HI>con&s;ume it upon their lu&s;ts,</HI> Jam. iv. 3. Some think by their prayers to make &s;ome compen&s;ation for pa&s;t mi&s;carriages, that they may run on a new &s;core; 'tis no wonder at all that &s;uch prayers are an abomination to the holy God. But then it mu&s;t be acknowleged, that there are &s;ome &s;inners, who are put upon praying, and that in &s;ecret, by a &s;en&s;e of their &s;inful and wretched &s;tate, and their need of a Saviour, and out of a &s;erious concern for the welfare of their &s;ouls. And &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;uch &s;inners are not yet converted, yet there are hopeful &s;ymptoms upon them, and they are making progre&s;s towards conver&s;ion; and certainly it is much more plea&s;ing to God, for &s;inners to pray as well as they are able, in a contrite &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins and wants, and their ca&s;e is more hopeful, than if they liv'd in the carele&s;s omi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an important duty of wor&s;hip and means of grace. Con&s;ider therefore,</P>
<P N="4">(4) Prayer is one of tho&s;e ordinances of God where|by he conveys &s;aving grace, and therefore to be at|tended by unregenerate per&s;ons, no le&s;s than the hearing of the word, as being an appointed means of conver&s;ion; in the want of &s;upernatural abilities, they mu&s;t improve their natural faculties, &amp; continue lying at <HI>the pool of Bethe&s;da,</HI> waiting on God in out|ward ordinances, for the quickning healing influences of his holy Spirit. You are directed to <HI>take with you words, and turn to the Lord, and &s;ay unto him, take away all iniquity,</HI> &amp;c. Ho&s;. xiv. 2. And in this way God may meet you, as he has met thou&s;ands, with his gracious vi&s;its, and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings. But this leads me to the &s;econd particular,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="39" REF="003886_0041_100267C8D4CE3F88">
2. That it is <HI>the great concern of unconverted &s;inners to pray for converting grace.</HI> And having &s;hew'd it to be their unque&s;tionable duty to pray, that it is their great concern to pray for converting grace, requires no great labour or proof. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1) Conver&s;ion and repentance is the gift of God, and not in the &s;inners own power without divine grace, as has been prov'd, and every &s;uch gi&s;t mu&s;t be ask'd in prayer. Regenerating grace is a <HI>good</HI> and <HI>perfect gift</HI> that comes down from the <HI>Father of lights.</HI> Jam. i. 17, 18 <HI>Every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights. Of his own will begat he us,</HI> &amp;c Therefore it is highly fitting, and rea&s;onable, that if any man lack this gift, he &s;hould ask it of God, as ver&s;e 5 <HI>If any of you lack wi&s;dom,</HI> or grace, <HI>let him ask of God, that giveth unto all men liberally, and upbraid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th not, and it &s;hall be given</HI> 'Tis fitting that the indigent &s;inner &s;hould expre&s;s his de&s;ire and value of this gift; and that the donor of it &s;hould be acknowleg'd, and the honour of his grace &s;ecur'd by humble and earne&s;t prayer.</P>
<P N="2">(2) God has promi&s;ed the grace of regeneration and conver&s;ion. The fir&s;t &s;aving grace is matter of promi&s;e; it is exhibited to &s;inners in &s;uch promi&s;es as the&s;e, Deut. xxx. 6. <HI>The Lord thy God will circumci&s;e thine heart,</HI> &amp;c. Jer. xxxi. 33, 34. <HI>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts &mdash; They &s;hall all know me from the lea&s;t of them, unto the greate&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. Ezek. xxxvi. 26. <HI>A new heart will I give you,</HI> &amp;c. Now the promi&s;es are the rule &amp; warrant of our prayers. To pray for what God has promi&s;ed to give is to ask according to his will, <HI>and this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, be heareth us,</HI> Joh v. 14. And the promi&s;es afford great encouragement to a &s;inner's prayers, for hereby it appears not only that God can
<PB N="40" REF="003886_0042_10020BB4CA3914A8">work conver&s;ion if he will, but al&s;o that he will do it for &s;ome, yea for many, and mo&s;t probably for tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are &s;tirred up to &s;eek unto him for it. And &s;uch is the wretchedne&s;s of an uncon|verted &s;tate, that a probability of obtaining &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing &s;hould excite all to pray for it.</P>
<P N="3">(3) Prayer is the means &s;anctified, and appointed by God for the obtaining this gift. Among the many choice mercies promi&s;ed to the church and people of God, in <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvi. the promi&s;e of giving <HI>a new heart,</HI> and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, is of principal con&s;idera|tion, <HI>ver.</HI> 26, 27. yet the means which God has or|dained for the accompli&s;hment of this his promi&s;ed grace, is &s;erious and earne&s;t prayer; as it follows, ver. 37. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them.</HI> So Luk. xi. 13 &mdash; <HI>How much more &s;hall your heavenly father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</HI> God can indeed work grace without our prayers, and he is &s;ometimes <HI>found of them that &s;ought him not</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;ai.</HI> lxv.i.</NOTE>, in a way of &s;overeign preventing mercy: but tho' God has not ty'd him&s;elf to means, &s;o as never to work without them, yet he has &s;o ty'd us to them, as that we &s;hould never expect any &s;aving influences from above in the neglect of them, e&s;pecially to prayer, which is a &s;elf aba&s;ing, and &s;oul-humbling duty, re|qui&s;ite and conductive to the honour of divine grace, and nece&s;&s;ary to prepare us for the ble&s;&s;ed effects of it.</P>
<P N="4">(4) The calls of God to repentance and conver&s;ion are de&s;ign'd to direct and quicken &s;inners to &s;eek his converting grace. God calls &s;inners to do that which without his effectual grace they cannot do, as Ezek. xviii. 32 <HI>Make you a new heart, and a new &s;pirit:</HI> and yet it is his grace alone that mu&s;t do this, which
<PB N="41" REF="003886_0043_100267CA55F34EF8">therefore he has promi&s;ed, <HI>chap.</HI> xxxvi. 26. But not|with&s;tanding this, God's calls to &s;inners to turn, and make them a new heart, are not u&s;ele&s;s and in vain, tho' they labour under a moral impotency to obey the&s;e commands; but they are de&s;ign'd to &s;et them about their duty, with all &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, which is the mo&s;t effectual means of beating down all carnal conceits of their own &s;ufficiency, which they are prone to indulge, that being &s;en&s;ibly convinc'd of their own impotency, they might humbly implore the grace of God to work that in them which he requires of them. A man confined to a &s;ick bed, may per|haps &s;ometimes imagine that he can get up, &amp; walk, as at other times; but the lea&s;t attempt &s;oon makes him &s;en&s;ible of his impotence. So &s;inners may ima|gine that they can break off their &s;ins by repentance, and turn to God when they plea&s;e, and can &s;carce believe a nece&s;&s;ity of the almighty power and grace of God to work a change in their hearts in order thereunto, but when they make the attempt in good earne&s;t, and &s;et them&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly about the work of repentance, in renouncing carnal habits, and hum|bling their &s;ouls unto obedience to the will of God, they &s;oon begin to feel their own weakne&s;s, and need of the &s;uccours of divine grace, to carry them thro' a cour&s;e of repentance, in humiliation for, and morti|fication of &s;in, and in recovering them to and e&s;ta|bli&s;hing them in a new and holy cour&s;e of life; a &s;en&s;e whereof naturally and nece&s;&s;arily leads them to their prayers, &amp; engages them to &s;eek God by hum|ble and earne&s;t &s;upplications for the promi&s;ed aids and influences of his grace and Spirit. So that as the pro|mi&s;es are de&s;ign'd to encourage their compliance with the commands, &s;o the calls and commands of the word are de&s;ign'd to drive them to the promi&s;es, to &s;eek by prayer the grace promi&s;ed, which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to their effectual recovery from &s;in to holine&s;s.</P>

(5) If &s;inners are obliged to pray for any thing, they have the greate&s;t rea&s;on in the world to pray for converting grace. This is of greater nece&s;&s;ity and importance to their happine&s;s, than all temporal ble&s;&s;ings, than health, wealth, liberty, peace, or even than their daily bread: the&s;e things &s;erve only to the comfort and convenience of this pre&s;ent mortal life, and afford no relief to the &s;oul again&s;t its greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ities, and mi&s;eries, but the renewing &amp; healing grace of God is nece&s;&s;ary to the life and well being of the immortal &s;oul. Yea, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e they have more need to pray for converting grace, than for the remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins; for though this ought to be ask'd of God in prayer, yet without conver&s;ion there is no po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining it, repentance and re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins being in&s;eparably connected in the go&s;pel covenant But if we obtain converting grace, we are a&s;&s;ured of the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and of all the privileges of mercy, by the certain promi&s;e of God. I&s;ai lv. 7. <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his way, &mdash; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly par|don.</HI> And if God gives repentance, he will infalli|bly be&s;tow remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins: for he <HI>hath exalted</HI> his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>with his right hand, to be a prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to I&s;rael, and for|givene&s;s of &s;ins,</HI> Act. v. 31. Thus you &s;ee how much it is the concern of the unconverted to pray for con|verting grace.</P>
<P>Now then, let all unconverted ones, and all tho&s;e that have ju&s;t grounds to fear that they are yet in their &s;ins, and &s;trangers to the new birth, &s;uffer the word of exhortation to prevail with them.</P>

<P N="1">1. God's relation to them as their God in covenant affords great encouragement, <HI>as it &s;hews that he &s;tands
<PB N="74" REF="003886_0076_10020BE09F36DC28">ready to confer the &s;aving grace of the covenant upon them,</HI> if they don't put a bar in the way by a wilful contempt or refu&s;al, or if they do but &s;eek him ear|ne&s;tly for it.

God &s;tands ready to ble&s;s the children of the covenant, with his converting grace; and what an encouragement is this to a &s;erious and diligent &s;eeking of it!</P>
<P N="2">2. They may conclude from their covenant intere&s;t in God, <HI>that there is greater hope and likelihood, that he will be&s;tow his grace on them than others.</HI> 'Tis true indeed, that <HI>the Lord is ric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to all that call upon him,</HI> whether Jew or Greek, <HI>Rom.</HI> x. 12. but the children of the covenant are nearer to the grace of God than others: they have a greater &s;ufficiency of means and advantages, they have the prayers, in&s;tructions, and examples of their pious parents, and the prayers of the church for them, and word of God read and heard; to all which means the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Spirit is annex'd by the promi&s;e of God. I&s;ai. lix. 21. <HI>As for me, this is my covenant with them, &s;aith the Lord, my Spirit that is upon thee, &amp; my words which I have put in thy mouth, &s;hall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy &s;eed,</HI> &amp;c.

<P N="3">3. <HI>There are indefinite promi&s;es of the covenant, that belong to them, which are ordinarily obtain'd in the way of prayer;</HI> promi&s;es of regenerating, converting grace, (as I have ob&s;erv'd) Now to whom, or on who&s;e behalf are tho&s;e promi&s;es made, but to the &s;eed of God's covenant people? the children of the church who need to be regenerated and converted? Such as God's promi&s;e <HI>of circumci&s;ing our hearts,</HI> and <HI>the heart of our &s;eed,</HI> his <HI>pouring</HI> his <HI>Spirit</HI> upon our <HI>&s;eed,</HI> and his <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> on our off-&s;pring<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai xliv. 3.</NOTE> the promi&s;e of <HI>writing</HI> his <HI>law on our hearts</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. viii. 10.</NOTE> and others which I have mentioned. They run indefinitely, but are all made to the church on the behalf of their uncon|verted children, and are &s;ealed to them, as by cir|cumci&s;ion of old (whence the phra&s;e of <HI>circumci&s;ing their hearts</HI>) &s;o by bapti&s;m <HI>now,</HI> (whence the &s;ame work of grace is term'd <HI>the wa&s;hing of regeneration,</HI> Tit. iii. 5. agreably to God's promi&s;e, Ezek. xxxvi. 25. <HI>Then will I &s;prinkle clean water upon you, and ye &s;hall be clean: from all your filthine&s;s&mdash;will I clean&s;e you</HI>) And I have &s;hewed, that God hath appointed prayer as the means of the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e pro|mi&s;es. Therefore in pleading their covenant intere&s;t in God, they do in effect plead the&s;e promi&s;es, which
<PB N="76" REF="003886_0078_100267FD28F54678">God has made and &s;ealed to them; and this is to pray <HI>according to his will:</HI> and therefore they may be encouraged to hope that they &s;hall not &s;eek in vain. And con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It is a plea very plea&s;ing to God, and prevailing with him.</HI> Partly,</P>
<P N="1">(1) As it implies <HI>a &s;en&s;e of their obligation to God, and an inclination and de&s;ire to come up to their cove|nanted duty,</HI> and to an&s;wer God's relation to them, by a &s;erious and hearty dedication of them&s;elves to him. <HI>Turn me</HI> to thy &s;elf, O Lord, <HI>for thou art my God:</HI> the import of which prayer, from the mouth of a child of the covenant, mu&s;t be this, <HI>viz</HI> Lord, I own thee to be my God, &amp; to have a &s;upream right and dominion in and over me, not only as creator and ruler of the world, but as a God, and Father by covenant, whereby I am &s;olemnly bound to love, and &s;erve, and glorify thee; I have &s;infully &amp; &s;hamefully broken thy covenant, and have <HI>for&s;aken</HI> my own <HI>mercies,</HI> and turned a&s;ide to <HI>lying vanities;</HI> but the de&s;ire of my &s;oul is to return to thee, in compliance with thy merciful invitation, <HI>return ye back&s;liding children</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> iii.<HI>23.</HI></NOTE>; O grant me the grace which thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed, to re&s;tore me, by repentance, unto my duty and happine&s;s, in &s;erving and enjoying thee as my God and portion for ever. Such a plea from a bro|ken hearted &s;inner, is very agreable to the will of God, and mu&s;t needs be of great force and preva|lency with him. Partly,</P>
<P N="2">(2) As it argues <HI>a good temper of mind, and a di&s;po|&s;ition plea&s;ing to God to improve a covenant intere&s;t in him, as a plea for &s;pecial grace.</HI> It may indeed, be pleaded by believers, for all kinds of mercies, even

But to make choice of and prefer renewing grace above all other in|&s;tances of covenant mercies, is no &s;mall &s;ymptom of a gracious di&s;po&s;ition, which he that <HI>will not break a brui&s;ed reed,</HI> nor <HI>quench the &s;moaking flax,</HI> will not de&s;pi&s;e, becau&s;e it is the work of his own grace: and when God has put &s;uch a tho't and de&s;ire into a &s;in|ner's heart, it may rea&s;onably be hop'd, that it &s;hall not be without &s;ucce&s;s. We know how <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;uc|ceeded in that prayer, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> i. God puts it to his choice to ask what he would, ver. 7. &mdash; <HI>Ask what I &s;hall give thee,</HI> Solomon's reque&s;t is, ver. 10. <HI>Give me now wi&s;dom, and knowlege, that I may go out and come in before this people;</HI> and how plea&s;ing this reque&s;t was to God, appears from the an&s;wer given to it, ver. 11, 12. <HI>God &s;aid to Solomon, Becau&s;e this was in thine heart, and thou ha&s;t not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet ha&s;t asked long life, but ha&s;t asked wi&s;dom and knowlege for thy &s;elf, that thou maye&s;t judge my people,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Wi&s;dom and know|lege is granted unto thee, and I will give thee riches and wealth, and honour, &s;uch as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither &s;hall there any after thee have the like.</HI> Thus, tho&s;e that <HI>&s;eek fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t the king|dom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &s;hall not only obtain what they &s;eek, but &s;hall have <HI>all other things</HI> (&s;o far as God &s;ees be&s;t) <HI>added unto them</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. vi.<HI>33.</HI></NOTE>. Partly,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Becau&s;e the glory of God is more nearly intere&s;ted in this petition and plea;</HI> more than in praying for the pardon of &s;in: for pardon of &s;in more immediately re&s;pects the &s;inner's &s;ecurity and comfort, which he may de&s;ire from &s;elf-love; but grace to &s;erve God, is more immediately conducive to his glory Now as Chri&s;t has taught us to make this our fir&s;t &amp; principal
<PB N="78" REF="003886_0080_10020BE3F0B4C7D0">petition, <HI>thy name be hallowed,</HI> or glorified, &s;o the more nearly the glory of God's name is concern'd in any petition that we offer up to him, the more plea|&s;ing it is to him, &amp; the more hope of &s;peeding. And it is e&s;pecially for the glory of God in the eyes of the world, that tho&s;e to whom he &s;tands in vi&s;ible rela|tion, &s;hould be an holy people, as his name is more di&s;honour'd by the unholine&s;s of their lives, than by the &s;ins of others; for he will <HI>be &s;anctified in all them that come nigh him,</HI> Lev. x 3. And as God makes this an argument with him&s;elf in promi&s;ing &s;anctifying grace to his people. Ezek. xxxvi. 22, 23. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, I do not this for your &s;akes, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, but for my holy Names &s;ake, which ye have pro|phaned among the heathen. &mdash; And I will &s;anctify my great Name, which was prophaned among the heathen, which ye have prophaned in the mid&s;t of them,</HI> &amp;c. So it may be pleaded to good purpo&s;e, by the children of God's people, in prayer for converting &s;anctifying grace; <HI>Not for my &s;ake Lord,</HI> tho' thou &s;houlde&s;t have no regard to &s;uch an unworthy worm as I am, but (&s;ince thou ha&s;t taken me into &s;o near a relation to thy&s;elf) <HI>for thy holy Names &s;ake,</HI> for the glory of thy great Name (which will be more <HI>polluted</HI> and di&s;ho|nour'd by my &s;ins, than by the &s;ins of others who are aliens and &s;trangers) I beg the promi&s;ed gift of thy grace, to make me holy, and to enable me to walk an&s;werably to my covenant relation to thee, and that thou may'&s;t be <HI>&s;anctified</HI> in me, <HI>in the eyes</HI> of men. And what is this but to pray that God's name may be glorified?</P>
<P>'Tis confe&s;s'd that the &s;pirit of this plea (as it has been open'd in the&s;e particulars) can proceed only from a gracious heart, which has been impre&s;s'd by the Spirit of God, with a di&s;po&s;ition and tendency towards its divine original: but it &s;hall &s;uffice to have &s;hewed the native import of it rightly managed, and how prevalent with God, and what abundant encou|ragement

<P N="1">(1) In a word of exhortation <HI>to parents in covenant with God, to pray for their unconverted children.</HI> In your &s;upplications at the throne of grace for your own &s;ouls, you mu&s;t bear upon your heart the ca&s;e of your children's &s;ouls, and be earne&s;t in prayer, as for other mercies which they need, &s;o more e&s;pecially &amp; prin|cipally for the &s;aving grace of the covenant, that their &s;ouls may be cured of their corrupt bya&s;s, that they may be principled with the fear of God betimes, that they may be made wi&s;e, and virtuous, and holy; that <HI>good things</HI> may be <HI>found in them towards the God of I&s;rael;</HI> that being begotten again by the Spirit, they may be in&s;tated in the ble&s;&s;ings of God's family, and that whether they live a longer or &s;horter time, in health or &s;ickne&s;s, in pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity in this world, they may be made heirs of life &amp; immortality, and live in God's favour, and in his pre&s;ence for ever hereafter. It is unque&s;tionably the duty of all parents thus to pray for their children e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that are in covenant with God, in imitation of the exam|ple of the father of the faithful, Gen. xvii 18. <HI>O that I&s;hrael might live before thee!</HI> and of <HI>David,</HI> 1 Chron. xxix. 19. <HI>Give unto Solomon my &s;on a perfect heart to keep thy commandments &mdash;.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you mu&s;t expre&s;s and exerci&s;e &s;aith in God's promi&s;e, <HI>I will be the God of thy &s;eed;</HI> and plead the &s;ame argument that is here put into their mouths, Lord, thou art the God of my children by external covenant, and ha&s;t encouraged me therefore to dedi|cate them to thee, and they are thine not only by creation, but by bapti&s;mal dedication: O take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of them for thy &s;elf, betimes, by thine indwel|ling Spirit, <HI>turn them</HI> to thy&s;elf from &s;in &amp; &s;atan from the vanities of the world, and a vain conver&s;ation;

You have this encourage|ment over and above what has been propounded to the unconverted in general, that the Lord is <HI>your God</HI> in external covenant. The encouragement ari&s;ing hence to &s;eek the grace of the covenant, has been at large declared: God's promi&s;e of being your God, virtually compriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s all the promi&s;es of grace contain|ed in the &s;criptures of both te&s;taments; which mu&s;t
<PB N="82" REF="003886_0084_10026805D00F57E8">be drawn forth to an accompli&s;hment by prayer; and you may with more confidence than others, plead &s;uch indefinite promi&s;es, as that, <HI>I will give a new heart: I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts,</HI> and the like. God is ready to give Him&s;elf, his Son, his Spirit and grace to &s;uch as you, which you &s;hould improve as a motive to &s;eek him earne&s;tly &amp; diligently; and as a ground of faith and confidence in prayer. Ble&s;s God, therefore, for &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a favour, that you have <HI>a name</HI> and <HI>a place in his hou&s;e,</HI> and are admitted into &s;o near a relation to him; on which account, you may with good rea&s;on &s;ay, <HI>the lines are fallen to me in plea&s;ant places, yea I have a goodly heritage.</HI> Yet be caution'd again&s;t tru&s;ting in the privileges of your birth, and bapti&s;m; for tho' you are born of the mo&s;t religious parents, and baptized in the church, yet you are al&s;o born in &s;in and corruption as much as others, and <HI>are by nature children of wrath even as others:</HI> the natures you derived from your fir&s;t birth, being as carnal, and as deeply polluted as tho&s;e of others; and the &s;ins of your lives being again&s;t greater mercies and engage|ments, than the &s;ins of others, will expo&s;e you to a &s;orer condemnation. See then, a nece&s;&s;ity of your be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g born again of the Spirit, otherwi&s;e it had been better for you never to have been born at all, never to have had a being. See al&s;o a nece&s;&s;ity of the grace of God to work this change in you, and of earne&s;t &s;upplication for that grace, whereunto you are encou|raged by the covenant offers, and promi&s;es of grace, &s;ealed to you in your bapti&s;m, the obligations &amp; pri|vileges whereof you &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly &amp; well con&s;ider.</P>
<P>And if the&s;e con&s;iderations have been effectual to work any convictions on your minds, delay not the pro&s;ecution of them, but take the fir&s;t opportunity in &s;ome convenient retirement, to pour out your hearts before God in the language of repenting <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and fall down on your knees, and &s;ay, in words to
<PB N="83" REF="003886_0085_1002680942298B08">this effect; O Lord God of my fathers and my God! thou ha&s;t of thine infinite mercy, <HI>brought me into bonds of thy covenant</HI> (in my early days) wherein thou ha&s;t engaged and &s;ealed to be my God, and Father, Re|deemer and Sanctifier, as I am laid under a &s;ealed obligation to be thine; I confe&s;s and bewail my treacherous departures from thee, and the degeneracy of my nature and life, for which I de&s;erve to be ca&s;t off by thee for ever; neverthele&s;s thou ha&s;t made known to me by thy word, that thou ha&s;t mercy in &s;tore for thy back&s;liding children, both for pardon and renovation, thro' the merits of my Redeemer's blood; I acknowlege thee, Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, to be my God in Chri&s;t, and de&s;ire to comply with thy gracious calls to return to thee from all my back&s;lidings, and in a &s;en&s;e of my own in&s;ufficiency, I beg thy promi&s;ed grace to enable me; <HI>turn thou me and I &s;hall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God.</HI></P>
<P>The rule of God's di&s;pen&s;ation towards the children of his covenant people, is, not to leave them till they fir&s;t for&s;ake him. 2 Chron. xv. 2. <HI>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; if ye &s;eek him, he will be found of you; but if ye for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake you.</HI> And they may be &s;aid to for&s;ake him, either by cour&s;es of open tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, or by neglects of religious du|ties, e&s;pecially the neglect of &s;eeking God by prayer; for there is no <HI>medium</HI> between <HI>&s;eeking</HI> and <HI>for&s;aking</HI> him. If they for&s;ake him, <HI>he will ca&s;t them off for ever; but they that &s;eek</HI> him <HI>early &s;hall find</HI> him: and if the &s;eed of I&s;rael would thus &s;eek him, &s;eek him <HI>early,</HI> &s;eek him <HI>earne&s;tly,</HI> verily they &s;hall not be found to &s;eek in vain.</P>
