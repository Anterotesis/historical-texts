<P>THE <HI>Chapter</HI> contains the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing wherewith Mo&s;es the Man of God ble&s;&s;ed the Children of I&s;rael before his death.</HI> He had been a <HI>Father</HI> to them, even as if he had begot|ten and conceived them; He had <HI>carry'd 'em as in his bo&s;ome, as a nur&s;ing father beareth the &s;uck|ing child,</HI> towards the land which God had &s;worn unto their Fathers to give them: And now like <HI>Jacob,</HI> their natural Father, he dies, as he had liv'd, loving them, caring for 'em, pray|ing for and ble&s;&s;ing of 'em. He had been their
<PB N="2" REF="002018_0005_0FBA863244138888"><HI>Governour</HI> and Commander in chief, and having had a Princely Education in the Court of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and being highly accompli&s;hed by the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom, meekne&s;s and courage for the Government of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> he was by the Divine Election con&s;tituted <HI>King in Je&s;hurun;</HI> as our Context has it: And now like another <HI>David</HI> he dies praying for and ble&s;&s;ing the Inheritance of the Lord over whom he had been ruling. Again, He had been a <HI>Prophet</HI> of the Lord unto and among his People; <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the Man of God, and an Eminent Type of the Great Prophet and King of the Church; and now like the A&s;cen|ding JESUS, being about to leave his People, he <HI>lifts up his hands</HI> in prayer and ble&s;&s;es 'em. Yea his Ble&s;&s;ing of the <HI>Tribes,</HI> like that of <HI>Ja|cobs</HI> to his Sons, is a very famous <HI>Prophecy,</HI> wherein he foretels the <HI>Lot</HI> of the Tribes, their <HI>Genius, Scituation, Imployments, Honours,</HI> and <HI>Services;</HI> what &s;hould befal them hereafter; And the Event an&s;wer'd his words, and &s;how'd that he &s;pake by In&s;piration and the Spirit of Prophecy.</P>
<P>The particular part of the Prophecy and the Ble&s;&s;ing now before us is that which re&s;pects <HI>Zebulun</HI> and <HI>I&s;&s;achar;</HI> who are here put toge|ther becau&s;e of their Con&s;anguinity &amp; Nei'bour|hood, being the Sons of one Mother, and their lots joyning together, which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in Spirit fore&s;ees and foretels.

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. The Ble&s;&s;ing and the Prophecy here re|&s;pects the Scituation, bu&s;ine&s;s and imploy|ment of the&s;e two tribes; <HI>Zebulun in his going out, and I&s;&s;achar in his tents. Zebulun</HI> was to inhabit on the Sea-coa&s;ts, and his bu&s;ine&s;s was to ly chiefly in trade and merchandize. As <HI>Jacob</HI> had long &s;ince foretold of him; Gen. 49.13. <HI>Zebulun &s;hall be for an Haven of Ships, and his Border &s;hall be unto Zidon.</HI> "They had three ports on the Sea of <HI>Gene&s;aret,</HI> and were not far from the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> It was a tribe of Merchants and Mariners. Their <HI>going out,</HI> tho' &s;ometimes it was to <HI>War,</HI> nor are they with|out their prai&s;e for <HI>valour;</HI> (&s;ee <HI>Judg.</HI> 5.18. and 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12.33.) Yet it &s;eems meant of their <HI>Voy|ages,</HI> Exportation and Importation by Sea.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>I&s;&s;achars</HI> lot was more <HI>In|land,</HI> and his bu&s;ine&s;s more at home, in his <HI>tents,</HI> as the <HI>text</HI> &s;peaks. His was a more retir'd, and in his E&s;timation a more happy, Country Im|ployment, <HI>in tillage and feeding cattle. I&s;&s;achar</HI> had his quiet and profitable <HI>husbandry;</HI> and was well contented with it; for as <HI>Jacob</HI> had prophe&s;ied of him long before, <HI>He &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> that re&s;t was good and the land plea&s;ant,</HI> while the Sea look'd rough to him (&s;ayes One) and he <HI>bowed</HI> him&s;elf to labour.</P>
<P N="2">2. The prophecy and the ble&s;&s;ing here &s;up|po&s;es and re&s;pects the <HI>felicity</HI> and <HI>pro&s;perity</HI> of
<PB N="4" REF="002018_0007_0FBA863531C9D980">the&s;e two Tribes, in their re&s;pective place and bu&s;ine&s;s: <HI>Rejoyce Zebulun</HI> in thy going out, and <HI>rejoyce I&s;&s;achar</HI> in thy tents. It is a <HI>Prayer</HI> for each; let them rejoyce, GOD grant 'em Cau&s;e of Joy both the one &amp; the other; this ble&s;&s;ing I wi&s;h them from GOD. And it is a <HI>Prophecy,</HI> that they &s;hould have rea&s;on to rejoyce, and &s;hould be made to rejoyce. It is a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of Joy from GOD, who&s;e ble&s;&s;ing gives the Pro&s;perity and the Joy. And it &s;ounds al&s;o like a <HI>Grarulation</HI> with them on this pro&s;pect; <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> joyes in it, congratulates 'em upon it; gives the ble&s;&s;ing with a dying Fathers Joy &mdash;; <HI>My &s;on, the Lord be with thee, and pro&s;per thou.</HI> Finally, It is a <HI>Precept</HI> to both one and the other to rejoyce in their lot, in their work, and in the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD upon them therein. Only ob&s;erve, <HI>Zebu|lun</HI> is twice named: <HI>And of Zebulun he &s;aid, Rejoyce</HI> Zebulun <HI>in thy going out.</HI> This trading Tribe &s;eems to have a double portion of Joy and pro&s;perity a&s;&s;ured to it. Their pro&s;perity comes over again therefore in the next ver&s;e; <HI>They &s;hall &s;uck of the abundance of the Seas, and of Trea&s;ures hid in the Sand.</HI> Some read &mdash;The <HI>In|undation of the Sea;</HI> &s;uch the flowing in of riches to them by it; their pro&s;perity &s;hould be as a <HI>&s;tood.</HI> They &s;hould import abundance, and be enricht by their commerce and trafick; have trea&s;ures in gold and &s;ilver, or in other things of equal value.</P>

<P N="3">3.

<P>Happy People! <HI>pro&s;perous</HI> and <HI>pious!</HI> the one a good rea&s;on for the other; the one no hindrance of the other. GODS ble&s;&s;ing a peo|ple obliges them to be <HI>religious;</HI> and yet how often is pro&s;perity a means of a peoples Irre|ligion. A pro&s;perous people ought in ju&s;tice and gratitude to be a <HI>devout</HI> people; and hap|py it is when it is &s;o. How happy <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI> and <HI>Zebulun</HI> in this that it was foretold and pro|mis'd of them, that they &s;hould be &s;o. This was to be <HI>ble&s;&s;ed indeed.</HI> Let this be the Ble&s;|&s;ing of <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> of the Sea-coa&s;t and Inland, of Husbandman and Marinet, Merchant &amp; Trades man; in this let all agree &amp; unite&mdash;,
<PB N="6" REF="002018_0009_0FBA86382D6A1D28">Namely, <HI>to call one another to the Mountain, to offer there the &s;acrifices of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They &s;hall call:</HI> how call? inform, in&s;truct, invite, per&s;wade, admoni&s;h and exhort, excite and &s;tir up one another, by word, by example, by influence; with readine&s;s and chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>They &s;hall call <HI>the people:</HI> what people? why 1. Their <HI>Neibours</HI> and brethren among whom they dwelt, and thro' who&s;e towns and villages they pa&s;s'd as they went up to <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem.</HI> Or 2. <HI>Foreiners,</HI> the people of other Coun|tries, that came to trade among them, or to whom they &s;ail'd: they &s;hould inform them of <HI>I&s;raels</HI> GOD, his laws, his works, his name and hou&s;e and wor&s;hip; they &s;hould propagate re|ligion abroad by their Merchandize, and pro&s;e|lyte &s;trangers at home. Happy <HI>Zebulun,</HI> pecu|liarly advantaged for this, and that had a heart to improve it. <HI>They &s;hall call the people</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;<HI>To the Mountain:</HI> what Mountain? the Mountain of the Lords hou&s;e, <HI>Mount Sion in Je|ru&s;alem;</HI> which was Mount <HI>Moriah.</HI> Here is a a prophecy of <HI>Solomons Temple</HI> there, the Hou&s;e of Wor&s;hip.

<PB N="7" REF="002018_0010_0FBA8639C60CACF0">thanks unto the Name of the LORD;</HI> and as they went up they were won't to call upon one another &s;aying, <HI>Let us go up to the Hou&s;e of the Lord,</HI> P&s;al. 122.</P>
<P><HI>There they &s;hall offer &s;acrifices of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Such as the Law requir'd of them. Such as in gratitude and ju&s;tice were due unto GOD from them.

<P>I come therefore to make a few practical and in&s;tructive <HI>Notes</HI> or <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> from the Text.</P>
<P N="1">I. And in the fir&s;t place I ob&s;erve, <HI>That GOD the Wi&s;e and Great Governour of the world ap|points, ordains and determines our Times and our Habitations; and the Callings and Imployments of people as well as the places of their abode.</HI> Known unto GOD are all his works, from the beginning of the world unto the end of it. There is not a place nor per&s;on or thing in it, nor a circum|&s;tance of one or the other, but what is order'd by infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, and with con|&s;ummate unerring Coun&s;el. So in particular, are the habitable places of the earth, the times of their flouri&s;hing, and who &s;hall inhabit the &s;ame, thro' the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Generations of men.
<PB N="8" REF="002018_0011_0FBA863B7AECAFB0">This the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> ob&s;erved to the people at <HI>A|thens,</HI> and it is a prime and great Principle in the Doctrine of Divine Providence; <HI>That God who made the world and all things therein, Lord of heaven and earth, who gives to all life and breath and all things, hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and bath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of every ones habitation,</HI> Acts 17.26. The times and circum&s;tances of every per&s;on, in <HI>all</HI> the nations of men, that dwell on <HI>all</HI> the face of the earth, are foreknown &amp; determined by the great Creator &amp; Governour of all things. <Q>He that appointed the Earth to be an habita|tion for the Children of men, has appointed to the Children of men a di&s;tinction of habita|tion upon the earth.</Q> He made the earth to be inhabited in one place and in another, and Man to <HI>multiply</HI> upon it, and to <HI>di&s;per&s;e</HI> over it. He &s;ets the bounds of <HI>Nations</HI> and appoints their times; the times of <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> al&s;o and their dwelligns. He fits per&s;ons for the days and for the places which he allots unto them; and by a differing Genius directs and inclines one to this calling and abode, and another to that. He forms one man for his husbandry and another for his merchandize. One loves the Seacoa&s;t and another the Inland; One the trading bu&s;y Town, and another the retir'd &s;ilent Villages. There is as much difference in men, tho' made of one blood, their inclinations and capacities, gu&s;ts and reli&s;hes, as there is in places, times and occa&s;ions. How near in blood were <HI>Zebulun</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="002018_0012_0FBA863F942C3EE0">and <HI>I&s;&s;achar,</HI> and even their lots adjoyning too, and yet the one &s;cituated and made for trafick by &s;ea, and if Occa&s;ion for war; the other for pa&s;turage and peace. So <HI>E&s;au</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> lay to|gether in one womb, and were born in one hour, we may &s;uppo&s;e (&amp; then under the &s;ame <HI>Planet,</HI> if there were any thing in that) and the boyes grew up together under the &s;ame Roof, and the &s;ame In&s;titutions of their gracious parents; but the one was a <HI>cunning hunter, a Man of the field;</HI> the other a <HI>plain man, dwelling in tents,</HI> Gen. 25.27. The one for an active, the other for the contemplative life; the one a hunter of the feirce or timerous wild bea&s;ts of the woods, the other a mild and gentle &s;hepherd who&s;e plea&s;ure it was to feed and tend u&s;eful &s;heep. Thus Providence fir&s;t variou&s;ly inclines &amp; gifts men, and then di&s;po&s;es of them here and there, to this or that: forms &s;ome for the <HI>City</HI> and places 'em therein; &s;ome for the <HI>Country</HI> and &s;eats 'em there; inclines &s;ome to the <HI>Sea,</HI> and &s;ends 'em forth into the world for the &s;ervice of many places; but keeps mo&s;t <HI>a&s;hore</HI> on the dry land, the more natural Element to us; &s;et|tles &s;ome in the Sea-ports, others in the Inland Towns and upon plea&s;ant Rivers; and it makes va&s;tly for the common Good that men are &s;o variou&s;ly led; <Q>&s;ome to a book, &s;ome to trades, &s;ome to the &s;ea, and &s;ome to rural affairs. 'Tis well it is &s;o, &s;ayes One on the <HI>Text;</HI> 'twas for the common good of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> that the men of <HI>Zebulun</HI> were for Merchandize and the men of <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI> for Husbandry; for <HI>if the
<PB N="10" REF="002018_0013_0FBA8641B7935350">whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? and if the whole were the ear, where were the &s;ee|ing?</HI> Wherefore it is the wi&s;dom and duty of every one to accommodate them&s;elves to their own proper places and bu&s;ine&s;s, as God has called every one and di&s;po&s;ed of them; wherever and to what&s;over it be; and it is a great happine&s;s to be well plea&s;ed without place and work.</Q></P>
<P N="2">II. I ob&s;erve from the Text, <HI>That it is the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD that makes one Place or another, and the Men of one Occupation or another pro&s;pe|rous and &s;ucce&s;sful. I&s;&s;achar</HI> and <HI>Zebulun</HI> here are &s;harers in the &s;ame Ble&s;&s;ing from GOD, ac|cording to the Promi&s;e, Deut. 28.3&mdash;7. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed &s;halt thou be in the city and ble&s;&s;ed in the field; ble&s;&s;ed in the fruit of thy ground; thy cattel, thy kine and thy &s;heep; and ble&s;&s;ed when thou come&s;t in and when thou goe&s;t out.</HI> Town and Country flouri&s;h by the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, the GOD of the &s;ea and dry land. He teaches the mer|chant as well as the husbandman di&s;cretion; <HI>The way of man is not in him&s;elf, it is not in him that walketh to direct his &s;teps.</HI> It is GOD that <HI>girdeth a man with &s;trength and maketh his way perfect.</HI> He ble&s;&s;es the work of our hand. He crowns places &amp; per&s;ons with his goodne&s;s. It is a vain &amp; impious thing to look for &s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;perity in any of our affairs, but by the ble&s;&s;ing of Providence; and as evil is it to a&s;cribe the &s;ucce&s;s that does at any time attend us to our own prudence or diligence. This were to
<PB N="11" REF="002018_0014_0FBA8642CA618FF0"><HI>deify</HI> our &s;elves, and to <HI>deny</HI> the GOD that is a|bove; to do &s;acrifice to our own <HI>net,</HI> and burn Incence to our own <HI>drag.</HI> P&s;al. 127.1, 2. <HI>Except the Lord build the hou&s;e, they labour in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the City the watch|man waketh in vain; it is vain for you to ri&s;e up early, to &s;it up late, to eat the bread of &s;orrows.</HI> Deut 8.17. <HI>Say not thou in thy heart, my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth; but thou &s;halt remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.</HI></P>
<P>To GOD therefore the Prophet directs the <HI>Husbandman,</HI> to ask wi&s;dom and &s;trength, to de|pend on his ble&s;&s;ing, and to give his prai&s;es when he reaps his harve&s;t. I&s;ai. 28.23&mdash;29. <HI>Give ye ear and hear my voice, hearken and hear my &s;peech. Doth the plowman plow all day to &s;ow? doth he open and break the clod of his ground? When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not ca&s;t abroad the fitches, and &s;catter the cummin, and ca&s;t in the principal wheat, and the appointed barley, and the rie in their place? For his God doth in&s;truct him to di&s;cretion, and doth teach him: &mdash; This cometh forth from the LORD of Hosts, who is wonderful in coun&s;el and excellent in working.</HI> It is &s;uppos'd here that the hus|bandman applies him&s;elf to his bu&s;ine&s;s with a great deal of pains and prudence, from the &s;owing his &s;eed to the thre&s;hing it out again; that he does it all with a di&s;cretion and judg|ment equal to the labours of the Summer &s;ea|&s;on; But then all his skill, and the happy fruits
<PB N="12" REF="002018_0015_0FBA864441019568">of his labour, are from GOD, the LORD of ho&s;ts, by who&s;e excellent wi&s;dom and coun&s;el it is, that men do any thing wi&s;ely and di&s;creetly.</P>

<P>And have not the <HI>Merchant</HI> and the <HI>Mariner</HI> as much dependance on the ble&s;&s;ing of Provi|dence, and as much to acknowledge of it, in their pro&s;perity and &s;ucce&s;&s;es?

<P>If our Merchants look upon their <HI>&s;tacks of fi&s;h,</HI> mu&s;t they not own the munificent hand of Pro|vidence as much therein, as the Husbandman in the &s;tacks of <HI>hay and corn?</HI> 'tis hard to &s;ay which has mo&s;t of the divine bounty to &s;how, the <HI>barn-floors</HI> or the <HI>&s;tore-hou&s;es?</HI> And which is mo&s;t form'd for the inriching us, the <HI>Inland-country</HI> for the drying our fi&s;h, and our beauteous <HI>Havens</HI> for the receiving our Ships?

<P>If then <HI>Zebulun</HI> be made to rejoyce in his going out, or <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI> in his tents, it is from the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, upon which both the one and
<PB N="14" REF="002018_0017_0FBA8647327534B0">the other do alike depend, and thro' Grace are alike under. For our text teaches the Hus|bandman, the mariner, the trades-man and the merchant, that they do alike need and do alike enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ing of Providence; &s;hould &s;eek it, ob&s;erve it and a&s;cribe all their &s;ucce&s;&s;es or fru&s;trations to it.

<P N="3">III. I would ob&s;erve further from the Text, concerning the wi&s;dom and bounty and equal regards of Providence towards the people of one place and bu&s;ine&s;s and of another; &mdash; <HI>That riches and affluence, the comfort and happine&s;s of life is not confined here or there, but is common to one as well as the other; and that GOD hath wi&s;ely ordained the City and Country to have a mutual dependance one on another; need of and benefit by one another.

So that neither has the one any cau&s;e to <HI>envy</HI> the other, or to <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> the other; but both abundant rea&s;on to have the &s;ame care, honour and affection one for the other.</P>
<P><HI>Zebulun</HI> has his plea&s;ures, his &s;tores and trea|&s;ures; his toils too and cares and fears; his breaking lo&s;&s;es, &s;hipwrecks and &s;ore di&s;a&s;ters.

Which way &s;oever he turns his eye or bends his &s;teps, the gra&s;s, the corn, the trees are growing, the <HI>milk and honey flow|ing</HI> for him: &s;o <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI> reaps the abundance of the earth, while <HI>Zebulun</HI> &s;ucks of the trea&s;ures of the &s;ea, and has <HI>the joy of the harve&s;t</HI> his pe|culiar.</P>

<P>Thus equal are <HI>Zebulun</HI> and <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI> in their gains and plea&s;ures, and in their lo&s;&s;es and &s;or|rows, as GOD plea&s;es to di&s;tribute the one and the other.

It is our duty <HI>to rejoyce before the LORD,</HI> in the &s;ober chearful u&s;e of all the good things that the bounteous Providence of GOD gives us to enjoy.

<P>The trading and <HI>Sea port</HI> Towns are apt to grow profane and loo&s;e in their Manners; the <HI>Sea</HI> ca&s;ts up the <HI>mire &amp; dirt</HI> of profane &s;wear|ing &amp; cur&s;ing, of exce&s;&s;ive drinking, rude &s;peech and carriage among them: Worldline&s;s, pride, vanity and &s;en&s;uality, Uncleane&s;s and every <HI>worldly lust that wars again&s;t the &s;oul</HI> are bro't in among them.
