<P>_AT your invitation I appear on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, confident that you will in|dulge my free&s;t thoughts when evidently intended to afford aid to the <HI>Craft.</HI></P>
<P>FREQUENT addre&s;&s;es exclude us from the common topicks; but in &s;eeking variety, we ought not to forget our in&s;titution. The
<PB N="4" REF="033405_0003_0FF6EA0D05122FF0">hi&s;tory and the character of our order have the fir&s;t claims upon our attention, and will be the be&s;t guide to our duty.</P>
<P>WHEN our Order was introduced into this Colony, and from Bo&s;ton into Briti&s;h America, an evident change had begun in the manners and the political &s;entiments of the people. The ancient rigour of church di&s;cipline had been relaxed, and the crown was attempting to increa&s;e its prerogative. But the political pro&s;pects of the country were enlarged. Intere&s;t, rather than relig|ion, had drawn men into the capital, and the general character was at a cri&s;is. The &s;on of a bi&s;hop had been in the chair, and a con&s;picuous prelate
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dean Berkeley, afterwards Bi&s;hop.</NOTE> was in America, ex|pecting to enjoy a religious e&s;tabli&s;hment. The &s;hort life of governor Burnet prepared for the advancement of governor Belcher. Political men, whatever &s;y&s;tem they may adopt, are &s;ure to accompli&s;h a change of manners in a &s;imple people. The courts having been repeatedly removed from the
<PB N="5" REF="033405_0004_0FF6EA0FD849B660">capital, new a&s;&s;ociations were formed in op|po&s;ition to the new form of power. Min|i&s;ters and churches exerted, in &s;ecret, an in|fluence they no longer openly claimed. Bel|cher yielded in turn to all parties, in hopes to reconcile them. He had been in Germany and in England, and was acquainted with our order, which he permitted one of his family to encourage. When a&s;&s;ociations had become common, it was to be expected, and to be hoped, that &s;ome would exi&s;t free from party &s;trife, and remain &s;acred to &s;ocial plea&s;|ure. For this purpo&s;e, with the manners of Europe, MASONRY was introduced. It has continued to &s;pread, as our country has been prepared for its growth.</P>
<P>AT pre&s;ent, the number of Brethren in Bo&s;ton is greater than in any place through|out the Union. But the increa&s;e has been great in our capital, &s;ince the revolution, particularly in the number of Lodges. The &s;pirit of the people, among whom early a&s;&s;o|ciations appeared, has formed an habitual in|clination. Their political clubs, their me|chanic
<PB N="6" REF="033405_0005_0FF6EA1173645B58">&s;ocieties, their marine &s;ociety, their private clubs for friend&s;hip, for religion, for letters and for humanity: All their &s;ocial in&s;titutions flouri&s;h together. As they ri&s;e or &s;ink upon compari&s;on, the number of the a&s;&s;ociated is not le&s;&s;ened, but the relation is changed at plea&s;ure, as age, ta&s;te, or duty may lead. Such an a&s;&s;ociated place may not be found upon the globe, or &s;uch harmony. Hardly any man of rank, or reputation is to be found, who has not had his club nights, and the&s;e are frequently pa&s;&s;ed in private hou&s;es. What a change the increa&s;e of pub|lic amu&s;ements may accompli&s;h, is not to be imagined from pre&s;ent con&s;equences. We are happy in an appeal to the public, whether Ma&s;ons, in their public character have devi|ated from the &s;pirit of their In&s;titution. Bad men have been found. But Ma&s;ons have lived in love, without any interference with Church or State.</P>
<P>THEIR progre&s;s has lately been rapid. Petitions are con&s;tantly before the GRAND LODGE for new Lodges. They accompany
<PB N="7" REF="033405_0006_0FF6EA13E510FBB0">the increa&s;ing wealth and independence of the YEOMANRY, and will continue while we enjoy our unexampled pro&s;perity. Such are the pro&s;pects of an In&s;titution, de&s;igned to pre&s;erve the purity and the full extent of private friend&s;hip by a&s;&s;ociation. An In&s;ti|tution which never hopes to influence the af|fairs of State; which knows no &s;ect in relig|ion; and no qualification but of the good cit|izen. May it be glorious in its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>IN pa&s;&s;ing over an hi&s;tory of &s;ixty years, we are able fairly to judge of the cau&s;es, which have operated again&s;t our In&s;titu|tion, in our own country and the world; and while we ob&s;erve the oppo&s;ition to its progre&s;s, we may learn the duties we owe to its character and reputation. And we may con&s;ider three principal cau&s;es. The Clergy, who have an influence upon the popular o|pinion, being the guardians of the public morals; the Magi&s;trates, who are inve&s;ted with the civil authority; and that wonder|ful engine, <HI>ridicule,</HI> which has wrought the mo&s;t powerful effects upon the human mind.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="033405_0007_0FF6EA1630F11550">
WHEN we &s;peak of the Clergy, we intend not the order, but certain men in it. And we regard not the&s;e men, &s;o much as the age in which they have lived, and the prejudices they have entertained. Father Robin&s;on ju&s;tly &s;aid,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robin&s;on's Claude, on the compo&s;ition of a Sermon.</NOTE> "The hi&s;tory of the Pulpit is curious and entertaining. It has &s;poken all languages, and in all &s;orts of &s;tyle. It has partaken of all the cu&s;toms of the Schools, the Theatres and the Courts of all Countries, where it has been erected. It has been a &s;eat of wi&s;dom, and a &s;ink of non&s;en&s;e. It has been filled by the be&s;t and the wor&s;t of men. It has proved in &s;ome hands, a trumpet of &s;edition, and in others, a &s;ource of peace and con&s;olation." When we &s;peak of the Clergy then, we &s;peak not of the whole or|der. We love the prie&s;t in the patriarch of the fir&s;t families of mankind, and we hon|our the Clergy, as the enlightened friends of the be&s;t civil &s;ociety. But into this order, men will intrude, who have &s;tudied their Bible, and not mankind for whom it was
<PB N="9" REF="033405_0008_0FF6EA187300EE38">written. Who know more of their own opinions from dogmas, than from hi&s;tory and inve&s;tigation. And who hate what they have not been taught to practice, having never a&s;&s;ociated with mankind. Such as em|ploy an ingenuous concern for the morals of &s;ociety, and maintain a con&s;tant vigilance again&s;t the prevalent abu&s;es of all in&s;titu|tions, while they di&s;tingui&s;h the abu&s;es from the in&s;titutions them&s;elves, we reverence. We a&s;k their reproofs, and we are &s;ure, that they will be candid. Let the&s;e righteous men &s;mite us, and it will be kindne&s;s. Their le&s;&s;ons will e&s;tabli&s;h us, and not de&s;troy us. It is into the hands of other men we fear to fall.&mdash;Men, who have no charity for each other, and &s;o &s;urely can have no charity for us. Who hate the neare&s;t &s;ect mo&s;t, not becau&s;e it is the wor&s;t, but becau&s;e it is the neare&s;t. Not becau&s;e it mo&s;t ob&s;tructs the light from heaven, but becau&s;e it ob&s;cures the light of their fame and intere&s;t. Men who ply the &s;huttlecock of faith, with the dexterity of expert game&s;ters, and have the
<PB N="10" REF="033405_0009_0FF6EA1AB9451E18">art of making the multitude fly with its feathers. What do they blame? Is it a&s;&s;o|ciation! They cannot blame this ab&s;olutely. For if there be a charge again&s;t them, it is for the abu&s;e of this principle in their own intere&s;t. They mu&s;t then charge us with an abu&s;e of our a&s;&s;ociation. The charge they find in our manners, not in our principles. But they charge all &s;ects in Chri&s;tendom, with the &s;ame tendency, when they have the be&s;t men on earth belonging to them. But what is the abu&s;e. <HI>All</HI> Ma&s;ons are not &s;ober men. Let us try to reform them then. Paul tells us, that the Chri&s;tians of his days turned the Communion into an exce&s;s, by which &s;ome lo&s;t their lives. Ma&s;ons have not done wor&s;e than this. But did Paul up&s;et the tables, and rout the company, and &s;ay that he would have no eating and drinking together, as long as he lived. No. He in|vented means to correct abu&s;es. And to all, who will be &s;o kind, we will hearken. The cau&s;es of illiberal conduct can be ea&s;ily known. Men have been ignorant of the
<PB N="11" REF="033405_0010_0FF6EA1D05FC68E0">&s;ects, to which they have been intolerant, and ignorance has been the parent of their fears. Education has excited an abhorrence, which intere&s;t has &s;trengthened. The prev|alent vulgar errors have given the multi|tude into their power. But to whom are we more indebted, than to the wi&s;e men of the Clergy. The &s;candal will be removed, when the order becomes enlightened. The civil authority has been exerci&s;ed with greater wi&s;dom, as it has been le&s;s under eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal influence.&mdash;Becau&s;e more was feared for the Church, than the State. As we recede from the power of the Church, which like the cold of the North has checked the growth of every thing divine, we advance towards a milder &s;ky. The bigotry of Spain, and the power of the Inqui&s;ition in Portugal, opened a per&s;ecution again&s;t every thing they did not create, and could not ab&s;olutely com|mand. The toleration found nece&s;&s;ary for the population of Rome, proved more benign, and as the Princes of Italy gave freedom to Commerce, they became le&s;s &s;u&s;picious of
<PB N="12" REF="033405_0011_0FF6EA1F68062B88">foreign In&s;titutions. In France, which &s;o bravely maintained the Gallican privileges again&s;t the Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop, and thus en|ervated the power of the Church, MASONRY had full encouragement in the genius of the nation. The Church had been already in|&s;tructed not to refu&s;e amu&s;ements, but to a&s;&s;ociate them even with religion. Here MASONRY appeared with a pomp and parade, unknown in any other country, and here it had its additional grades, to which no other nation had advanced. At Court the&s;e grades were not unknown. In Germany, the&s;e a&s;|&s;ociations were in the &s;pirit of the North, and the antiquities of the North &s;hew the nobility as members and patrons. Such have been the mo&s;t eminent Princes of the empire. Such was the great Hero of Pru&s;&s;ia, and &s;uch are the Princes of tho&s;e happy and well in|&s;tructed Regions.</P>
<P>IN the Briti&s;h Empire, the parent of an|cient Ma&s;onry,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Eclectic.</NOTE> its progre&s;s has been well known, from the connexion between their
<PB N="13" REF="033405_0012_0FF6EA21A5C962B8">hi&s;tory and language and our own. The Engli&s;h nobility, but particularly the gent|ry, have e&s;teemed its honours. The &s;pirit has been well pre&s;erved among the gener|ous Iri&s;h, and has never been degraded by the Scots. The Briti&s;h Colonies in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, have pre&s;erved its reputa|tion. In the Republics, it has had all its character, as Holland will a&s;&s;ure us. Guarded again&s;t political di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, it can give no cau&s;e of jealou&s;y to an enlightened admin|i&s;tration. And &s;acred to friend&s;hip, it will always ble&s;s the public &s;pirit. But in its triumph, it has had <HI>&s;ullen,</HI> and not always &s;ilent foes. Its <HI>&s;implicity</HI> only can en&s;ure it general &s;ucce&s;s, yet this &s;implicity has been an objection, even to higher in&s;titutions. Super&s;tition has impo&s;ed an unkind opinion upon the vulgar. Other In&s;titutions have been jealous. Su&s;picion has hovered over its &s;ecrets, and bad con&s;equences, if they have not been known, have been feared. As all &s;ocieties have degraded each other, by charg|ing
<PB N="14" REF="033405_0013_0FF6EA23E3BEB608">the vices of a <HI>few</HI> upon the many, we have al&s;o had a part in the &s;hame.</P>
<P>RIDICULE, ever bu&s;y, not only to expo&s;e, but in&s;ult, has been licen&s;ed in all its cho&s;en &s;hafts. Proud of the laughter of the multi|tude, it has &s;trengthened objections, without the trouble to examine them. Ridicule, doubtle&s;s, is a cho&s;en in&s;trument in the hand of TRUTH. When a &s;harpened arrow of the judgment, and guided by the eye of di&s;cre|tion, whither benevolence points its way and gives it &s;trength to enter, it demands all the genius of SHAFTESBURY to give it due prai&s;e. But though it be a &s;harp, it &s;hould not be a poi&s;oned arrow. If it pierce error, it &s;hould not wound the &s;oul. Then the memory holds the &s;hame of error, while the under&s;tanding hates the blame. We are our own phy&s;icians in the remedy. But &s;uch is not the common ridicule of the world. It is as far from it as the ki&s;s of a friend, from the dagger of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. When preju|dice &s;ports with fal&s;e allu&s;ions, fear is &s;trength|ened into hatred, and truth is bent into
<PB N="15" REF="033405_0014_0FF6EA2648A921F0">deformity. Ridicule is then poi&s;on to a weak mind. The mo&s;t &s;imple fa&s;hions, the mo&s;t innocent cu&s;toms, and the mo&s;t familiar manners may ri&s;e di&s;gu&s;ting to the &s;ight. As in religious rites, whether it be wine, or bread, or water, each in turn may be ri|diculous to the &s;ectary, and the u&s;e and the end be forgotten. Sympathy may be denied every token of its duty, from fear of con|tempt. The addre&s;&s;es of the Clergy and Brethren have already di&s;armed buffoonery, by the moral and religious force given to the MASONIC CONSTITUTIONS. We mu&s;t not &s;ay, we care not for ill opinions. We ought not to renounce what we approve, if free from blame; but we ought to remember that every thing u&s;eful to our&s;elves and the world, will in &s;ome degree depend upon character. We &s;hould not give up our plea&s;ures, becau&s;e &s;ome men condemn them. We &s;hould not leave our forms, becau&s;e &s;ubject to ridicule from tho&s;e who feel not their love. We &s;hould relinqui&s;h nothing we can inno|cently
<PB N="16" REF="033405_0015_0FF6EA28952884E8">enjoy.&mdash;But as the world &s;ees us, we &s;hould be ambitious to di&s;play the virtues we profe&s;s.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent &s;tate of Europe has fixed the attention of the world upon our order. Its rapid &s;pread in the pre&s;ent century, the char|acter of its members, the coincidence of its de&s;igns, and its &s;ecret communications, have contributed to urge enquiries into its hi&s;tory, its principles, and its influence upon civil &s;ociety, and to bring the cri&s;is of its fate. The power of political a&s;&s;ociations was never more &s;eriou&s;ly feared, and the alarm has been as great as the danger. No di&s;coveries have yet been made, which can fairly impeach the in&s;titution of FREE MASONRY. The opin|ions of a country, in which it has had di&s;|tingui&s;hed honours, will a&s;&s;i&s;t the language of prejudice; but charges which are not well &s;upported by the be&s;t evidence, will not be received by candid minds.

Ma&s;onry has attracted the public notice. More is feared from the a&s;&s;ociation, than from the principle. Civil &s;ociety can apprehend no evil, while its leading members are known, and are free from any &s;u&s;picion of de&s;igns again&s;t civil e&s;tabli&s;hments. But the progre&s;s of a new philo&s;ophy, which has ac|compli&s;hed an important change in the opin|ions of Europe, has been great, and this philo&s;ophy has in&s;inuated it&s;elf into all &s;oci|eties. Its friends and its enemies have been a&s;toni&s;hed at its &s;ucce&s;s, and while its friends have continued active to combine all cau&s;es to aid its progre&s;s, its enemies became more jealous of every thing, which could be em|ployed in its &s;ervice. Que&s;tions never thought of before, have been a&s;ked about the origin of Free Ma&s;onry. Fal&s;e friends, and &s;erious enemies have con&s;pired to repre&s;ent it, as &s;uited the purpo&s;es of ridicule, or aver&s;ion, of their fears, or their wi&s;hes. But as yet
<PB N="18" REF="033405_0017_0FF7BBEC88F83808">they have acted without permanent effect, from the unwarranted boldne&s;s of their con|jectures, from their di&s;agreement in the hi&s;|tory and the object of the order, and partic|ularly from their ignorance of the manners of the age in which it fir&s;t obtained public notice.</P>
<P>THE Tomb of Morlai, is one of the con|temptible efforts which provokes a &s;mile from the initiated, but excites pity towards tho&s;e, who ra&s;hly admit jealou&s;ies uncomfortable to them&s;elves and their neighbours. This ex|travagant attempt to repre&s;ent Ma&s;onry as inimical to royalty, has a rival only in the counterpart of Profe&s;&s;or Robin&s;on, who re|cites the hi&s;tory of its u&s;e among the friends of Charles the fir&s;t of England. But if Morlai, five hundred years &s;ince, illuminated Lodges with principles ho&s;tile to royalty, how unhappy were the friends of Charles in the choice of an in&s;titution for his defence. But how happy the adepts to remain con|cealed, till they appeared in the clo&s;e of the French Revolution "to manage the good
<PB N="19" REF="033405_0018_0FF7BBF300BFECD0">natured and benevolent a&s;&s;ociates of the pre|paratory Lodges." Such men could never &s;e|riou&s;ly attempt to trace the in&s;titution, be|cau&s;e &s;uch an attempt would have brought them, where &s;uch an enmity, by con&s;ent of hi&s;torians, was without any political cau&s;e. Compare the hi&s;tory of the mother Lodges
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tomb of Morlai: This work ought to be compared with Robin&s;on.</NOTE> with the hi&s;tory of their dates in the thir|teenth century, e&s;pecially in Stockholm and in Scotland. Traditions profe&s;&s;edly received in this age, have left no belief of a political origin, and they are at lea&s;t good again&s;t bold in&s;inuations. MASONRY, whatever was its ancient hi&s;tory, has pre&s;erved it&s;elf free from any imputations of a de&s;ign upon the liber|ties or governments of Europe, till the pre&s;ent century. Its pro&s;perity has given the alarm. It has embraced men of every character in the &s;tate, and in the world of letters. Pride of di&s;tinction, in imitation of the orders in Europe, induced the Lodges of France and Germany, to accept the orders of the Knights,
<PB N="20" REF="033405_0019_0FF7BBF624A3F588">while men accu&s;tomed to literary honors, exceeded even the Univer&s;ities in the number of their degrees. The&s;e were &s;acred to a more intimate friend&s;hip, and as they flat|tered innocent prejudices, they were thought beneficial to the common cau&s;e, though ac|commodated only to exclu&s;ive privileges. But as the practice was not univer&s;al, and is modern, we can di&s;tingui&s;h the ancient in&s;ti|tution from all orders, which have been united with it, as ea&s;ily as we can primitive from corrupted Chri&s;tianity. The Engli&s;h Lodges exhibit the true form of the In&s;titu|tion, and vouch for its independence of all the orders, with which it has been connected.</P>
<P>THESE Lodges, from which we have deriv|ed our exi&s;tence, exempt us from any cen&s;ures to which modern degrees might give occa|&s;ion. The form of the primitive Lodges was retained in America, till the revolution. The attachment to the French, which was then &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o &s;incere, awakened an inclination to imitate them, but no attempts were made, beyond the orders, which exi&s;ted
<PB N="21" REF="033405_0020_0FF7BBF7CE49B700">under the monarchy. The fir&s;t members of a Lodge in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, &s;ome of which are living, and many of them have been well known to us, cannot be &s;u&s;pected of any &s;in|i&s;ter de&s;ign in that age. And we know e|nough of the progre&s;s in every other colony, to determine that no cau&s;es did counteract the original de&s;ign. The de&s;igns of the Brit|i&s;h Government had been long enough pur|&s;ued, to &s;atisfy us of the influence they would employ in the colonies. How far political opinion could influence the Scotch Lodge in 1752, may be judged from the circum|&s;tance that it was in&s;tituted as &s;oon as more than one Lodge was formed, and before any other cau&s;es than incidental curio&s;ity and emulation could exi&s;t. There was no gen|eral or &s;udden change from the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ment ever ob&s;erved, and the Convention in 1785, in which all the prejudices of the En|gli&s;h and Scotch Lodges were inve&s;tigated, did not even imagine a political cau&s;e of their &s;eparate exi&s;tence. The public fears may in|&s;truct us how much we may have gained in
<PB N="22" REF="033405_0021_0FF7BBFB57E395D8">our reputation by a&s;&s;ociation with the names of degraded orders, or by &s;ocieties expelled from Chri&s;tian countries.</P>
<P>BY a late work,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robi&s;on's Proof of a Con&s;piracy, &amp;c.</NOTE> confe&s;&s;edly written, from periodical papers, not always the vehicles of truth, and with evident de&s;ign to alarm the public mind, our attention has been called to the ILLUMINATI, who have been con&s;idered as an order of Ma&s;ons, though at the &s;ame time, it is confe&s;&s;ed, that they have not <HI>common</HI> principles.</P>
<P>IN this work it is ju&s;tly granted that Ma|&s;onry proceeded from England to Germany. The order of ILLUMINATI has lately originated in Germany.

<PB N="23" REF="033405_0022_0FF7BC0067980C20">four members in 1783 did not provoke an in|&s;tant di&s;&s;olution. Step after &s;tep was taken by the elector, and three years pa&s;&s;ed from the confe&s;&s;ion to the third edict, which aboli&s;hed the order. But Wei&s;hauft had the offer of a pen&s;ion, which he refu&s;ed. This &s;eems not to be an unequivocal proof of guilt. But in the work before us, the charge of guilt is not extended to the whole order of ILLUMINATI but is confined to &s;uppo&s;ed higher orders not yet fairly detected; and it is confe&s;&s;ed, that ba&s;e as were the higher degrees, very worthy men had united in the lower, without knowledge of any evil tendency. This confu&s;ed account is given in a manner adapted to excite the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices. Like a di&s;ingenuous ad|ver&s;ary, he alarms, by an unknown order, our fears of an innocent order, which he pre|tends to de&s;pi&s;e, while he confe&s;&s;es "that the order took its ri&s;e among FREE MASONS, but is totally different from Free Ma&s;onry." But a philo&s;opher might &s;ay, how ab&s;urd is it to de&s;pi&s;e a ritual, which has &s;o adequately an|&s;wered its purpo&s;es, and which has &s;uch real
<PB N="24" REF="033405_0023_0FF7BC031A398810">power over human nature, as to combine men together, to overthrow kingdoms. What a principle mu&s;t it command! While if it be a trifle, why &s;hould &s;uch vehement zeal be ex|pended upon it? Can trifles have &s;uch dang|ers? It &s;eems by the account, that Free Ma|&s;onry, and its kindred in&s;titutions, is a rival, and a powerful rival to all governments under heaven. It is then a mo&s;t powerful combi|nation. And what el&s;e is any government? And &s;urely the more &s;imple the means to com|bine men, in the &s;ecret of government, the better for mankind.

<P>BUT if we hear the invectives again&s;t an or|der, we ought to hear its vindication.

Such a caution ought at lea&s;t to &s;atisfy us, that it borrowed no bad principles from an order on which it was ingrafted.

And according to ancient Ma&s;onry, as may appear from its hi&s;tory, there can be no philanthropy incon&s;i&s;tent with law, &s;o|ciety
<PB N="31" REF="033405_0030_0FF7BC1B7093B310">and religion, as they are e&s;tabli&s;hed by mankind in civil life.

<P>BUT &s;hould it appear that there have been extravagant men, in the&s;e extraordinary times, we &s;hould remember that they ro&s;e out of the character of the age. The part they had taken as citizens at fir&s;t, and the di&s;con|tents they felt afterwards made them invent new forms of a&s;&s;ociation. They &s;eized upon &s;uch expedients, to promote their de&s;igns. Other orders have been corrupted. And, Have not the meek di&s;ciples of Je&s;us publi&s;hed their
<PB N="32" REF="033405_0031_0FF7BC2466F91CA0">political faith within the walls con&s;ecrated to the go&s;pel of peace? We reprobate not chri&s;t|ianity, when this liberty is abu&s;ed. The change in Europe is accompli&s;hed by no order of men. The &s;pirit has taken hold upon human nature. When the Abbe Barruel tells us, that from the <HI>hone&s;t &s;implicity</HI> of the fir&s;t or primary Lodges, they were not admitted to the &s;ecrets of the con&s;piracy, he &s;ays all we can a&s;k of a pre|judiced Author to exculpate Ma&s;ons with candid men, for &s;uch are the only Lodges of our ancient In&s;titution. But how ab&s;urd is the &s;u&s;picion! If the higher orders hold the &s;ecret, how are they to influence the Brethren, but as they influence mankind? If they do not conver&s;e with them in their Lodges, they can know them only as citizens. Ma&s;ons are not then in the &s;ecret. Have not &s;uch men excluded
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Going out from us, they were not of us.&mdash;<HI>John.</HI></NOTE> them&s;elves from all commu|nications in the Lodges? And will they have better opportunities to conver&s;e with the Brethren out of their Lodges than in them.</P>
<P>SUCH are the in&s;inuations of prejudice and party. Such is the confe&s;&s;ion, that Lodges
<PB N="33" REF="033405_0032_0FF7BC266AD49598">are not fit places for con&s;piracy. All their evidence amounts to this truth, that when a &s;pirit of revolution, or any thing el&s;e, pre|vails in a county, it pervades all cla&s;&s;es of cit|izens. The books, the churches, the private &s;ocieties will be full of it. And to rea&s;on fairly, as the &s;pirit of revolution &s;eized &s;ome ma&s;ons, &s;o it &s;eized &s;ome chri&s;tians, and as chri&s;tians form a &s;ect, &s;o ma&s;ons formed an order to enjoy their opinions. And the con|clu&s;ion is as &s;afe for one as the other, that they ought to be aboli&s;hed. And as a part of this wonderful di&s;covery is claimed by Rob|i&s;on, let him have the honor of it.</P>
<P>WE do not refu&s;e a fair inve&s;tigation. We a&s;k no privileges, which can endanger the State. Sooner may all our glory pa&s;s away, than one law fail. Let us turn to the hi&s;tory of Ma&s;onry, in the full records of its cha|racter and tran&s;actions. In what in&s;titution is there greater &s;ubordination? Is not its language from ancient governments? Does it not indulge the parade of forms, and the emblems of power, and employ the corre&s;|ponding
<PB N="34" REF="033405_0033_0FF7BC2B94141748">honours of the &s;tate? Are not its honours perpetual in the rank and the name? Has it not invited to the highe&s;t honours, the fir&s;t magi&s;trates of noble families? Has it not accepted Kings and Princes, the mo&s;t jealous of their power? Has it not flouri&s;hed in every form of government? Men have found means to a&s;&s;ociate political principles with Chri&s;tianity, becau&s;e, as Ma&s;onry, it does not profe&s;s to give exclu&s;ive favours to any form of government. But becau&s;e Chri&s;t|ianity does not decide upon the form of gov|ernment, Are not its precepts &s;acredly tena|cious of good citizen&s;hip? And is Ma&s;onry le&s;s explicit? Are not Lodges acce&s;&s;iable to all parties? Have not the de&s;igns of party, led men away from the primitive Lodges, in which all &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns were prevented by mutual jealou&s;y? Are not characters known? The Prote&s;tants and Catholics, after their &s;eparation did not hold them&s;elves accounta|ble for each other. AS AN ORDER, WE ARE SACREDLY BOUND TO THE LAWS AND CON|STITUTION, AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION
