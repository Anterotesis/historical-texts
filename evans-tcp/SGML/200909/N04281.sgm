<P>'_TIS an odd and vicious Conceit of the Super&s;titious, who in Popi&s;h Countries are called the Religious; that a &s;olitary Seque&s;tration from the &s;ocial Affairs and Duties of Life, afford a mighty Advan|tage to Religion: For this is contrary to the De&s;ign of the Creator in the Make and Con&s;titution of Man; oppo|&s;ite to the Providence and Precepts of God, and the Examples of holy Men recorded in &s;acred Hi&s;tory. The In&s;tance in our Text &s;hows that <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For their &s;tated Bu&s;ine&s;s, was to preach the Go&s;pel; tho' Fi&s;hing had been their Employment.</NOTE> or I think Diver&s;ion in proper Portions of Time, and other &s;uitable Circum&s;tances, are not hurtful, but very friendly to Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005285_0005_10171679F8786FA8">
The Apo&s;tles were con&s;tituted Fi&s;hers of Men, to allure and draw Souls to Chri&s;t, from a Pit of Sin and Mi&s;ery, to an Ocean of Piety and Plea&s;ure. &mdash;An high and really religious Employment! And <HI>our Lord</HI> gave them a <HI>Vacancy,</HI> with Re|&s;triction, <HI>but tarry ye at Jeru&s;alem.</HI> They had been commi&s;|&s;ioned long before, [<HI>Matth.</HI> x. 17 and <HI>Luke</HI> ix.] but before they were to enter upon their Enterprize, in which he &s;hould be corporally ab&s;ent, they mu&s;t have a Lei&s;ure refre&s;hing Sea|&s;on. To what &s;hould they in Rea&s;on have devoted this Inter|mi&s;&s;ion, but Fa&s;ting and Mourning, for now the Bridegroom was not always with them? Why, <HI>Obedience is better than Sa|crifice, and to hearken, than the Fat of Rams,</HI> 1 Sam. xv. 22. He who be&s;t knew the Nature of Man, before he was to &s;end Men upon extraordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s, would give them Lei&s;ure; nor was this Space confined wholly to Devotion. Some of it, we find, was &s;pent in Bu&s;ine&s;s or Diver&s;ion. Certainly the&s;e Saints were as &s;incerely and piou&s;ly affected to God, as the &s;uper&s;titious Biggots to Popery can, with any Shew of Mode&s;ty, pretend to be; yet they divert them&s;elves in &s;o &s;uitable a Sea&s;on, and our Lord not only appoints the Lei&s;ure, but &s;up|ports them in it by giving them a lucky Draught of Fi&s;hes. This &s;acred Story leads me to think,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. In the general, that the common Enterprizes of Life are not incon&s;i&s;tent with Piety towards God: But that infinite Holine&s;s may be plea&s;ed with them. And in particular, that</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>Some may think it &s;trange that I give my&s;elf the Trouble to illu&s;trate the&s;e Things, which, to them appear level to the lowe&s;t Capacity.</P>
<P>But all Men are not of the &s;ame Ca&s;t or Con&s;titution. A Propo&s;ition which is ea&s;y and evident to one, may be as doubt|ful and difficult to another; and its no uncommon Ca&s;e, for Men who have no higher End in their Employments, and have been un&s;ea&s;onable, unguarded and irregular in their Diver&s;ions, and have no higher End than Self, if they are convinced of their Idolatry and Carnality, to exclaim agai&s;t the World! Then when they mo&s;t of all need to be diligent in &s;ome good Employment, Diligence is termed Worldly-mindedne&s;s; &s;ea|&s;onably and temperately to recreate them&s;elves, is carnal
<PB N="7" REF="005285_0006_1017167FDFF04500">Plea&s;ure. The&s;e Difficulties require no great Depth of Tho't, nor a Multitude of Words for their Solution.</P>
<P>We may, in an ea&s;y and natural Manner, con&s;ider that Re|ligion is all of a Piece, and one Duty does not de&s;troy another. That Bu&s;ine&s;s and Diver&s;ion, in their proper Place and Time, determined from a good Principle, and performed piou&s;ly and prudently; are &s;o far from being offen&s;ive, that they are a nece&s;&s;ary Branch of our holy Religion.</P>
<P>Let us then in the general con&s;ider, <HI>Whether the common En|terprizes of human Life, be con&s;i&s;tent with practical Piety.</HI></P>
<P>Here we mu&s;t tell what we mean, by the common Enter|prizes of Life. And we renounce all unju&s;t and di&s;hone&s;t Methods of obtaining the Riches, Honours, and Plea&s;ures of the World: And all unlawful Games, and tho&s;e which are lawful, when they are un&s;uitably and irregularly managed.</P>
<P>We con&s;ider Bu&s;ine&s;s or Diver&s;ions, as human Under|&s;tandings. By Bu&s;ine&s;s, we mean our &s;tated Exerci&s;es, or that which we ought to employ mo&s;t of our Time in, and mo&s;t of our Thoughts about. Diver&s;ion is the turning a&s;ide from Bu&s;ine&s;s, in &s;ome proper Period, to refre&s;h our&s;elves, and fit us for a more chearful and lively Di&s;charge of Duty. Now, if it &s;hould be made evident, that the&s;e are Parts of our Duty to God, I &s;uppo&s;e they mu&s;t be con&s;i&s;tent with real Religion. And this will appear, if we con&s;ider, That God is an active Being, and propo&s;es him&s;elf as our Pattern. It's not only contrary to Scripture, and deep thinking, but common Sen&s;e, to &s;uppo&s;e the great Creator and Governour of all Worlds, idle and unactive. Every one conceives &s;omething of his Ope|ration, as the Over-ruler of human Affairs, or Author of all Things. And if God be Agent, he expects tho&s;e to be &s;uch who are capable of acting: And as he is perfect, and mu&s;t act in a mo&s;t excellent Manner, according to his own Nature, he mu&s;t expect and require his Creatures to act according to the Power with which he has endowed them. And as he has en|dowed Man with a Capacity of knowing &s;omething of him, he mu&s;t de&s;ign his imitating of him in his Mea&s;ure and De|gree. In this the Image of God in Man con&s;i&s;ts. And we are to imitate him in Labour and Re&s;t, as well as in other Re&s;pects This will be clear to you, if you recollect the Fourth Com|mandment
<PB N="8" REF="005285_0007_101716816D074C48"><HI>Six Days</HI> &s;halt <HI>thou</HI> Labour, for in &s;ix&mdash; <HI>the Lord made</HI>&mdash;and <HI>re&s;ted</HI> on the &s;eventh, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, no Man was made for Time, but Time for him: And as God u&s;es Eternity for his own Glory, according to his infinite Wi&s;dom and Power; &s;o he expects Man &s;hould &s;pend his Time, according to his Capacity&mdash;</P>
<P>Man's Capacity is the Mea&s;ure of his Duty, and the Na|ture of Man requires Re&s;t and Labour, and a prudent Inter|change and Succe&s;&s;ion of each. We were not obliged to do, in our Original, tho&s;e Things which our Species were not ca|pable of performing: But the Limitation of Nature was a Bound by the Deity, <HI>So far &s;halt thou come, and no farther.</HI> The Stretch of a human Mind, and the Strength of Man's Body, is limited by the &s;upream Di&s;po&s;er of all Things. And the &s;ame <HI>Being,</HI> in limiting our Capacity, makes out our Duty, by our Make and Frame, and ca&s;ual Circum&s;tances in the Cour&s;e of his divine Providence, he &s;hews a wi&s;e Man what he ought to do, and what to avoid, and how he &s;hould direct, guide, and govern him&s;elf or others. No mere Man ever could, nor will any Man that has the Government of him&s;elf, pretend to keep up an uninterrupted Series of Idlene&s;s and In|dolence, of Labour or Devotion; for Experience mu&s;t &s;oon convince them that Man's Nature is formed for Variety: He is a changeable Creature, and is &s;upported by Change. So Man at fir&s;t was put into the Garden of Plea&s;ure, not only to &s;erve his Maker, in his Devotions, and delight him&s;elf by his Sen&s;ations, but <HI>to dre&s;s it and to keep it:</HI> For in his primitive <HI>Make</HI> he needed tho&s;e Changes.</P>
<P>And we need them much more in our lap&s;ed State: As all the Works of God, in Nature and Revelation, manife&s;tly de|clare. Let tho&s;e who would form to their Imagination, a beautiful De&s;cription of the Original of the World, read Dr. <HI>Burnet:</HI> But I mu&s;t confine my&s;elf to Scripture, and the com|mon Current of our Experience, in the pre&s;ent State of Things; and as to that original State of the World, you will excu&s;e me <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> I &s;ay little about it, becau&s;e we have little to do with it. But if we gaze upon Nature, in it's pre&s;ent Situation, we &s;hall find, that every Thing calls for a prudent Alloy of Labour and Diver&s;ion: [Tho' I mu&s;t rejoin, becau&s;e I would not be wanting in Caution, by Labour, I would be under&s;tood to
<PB N="9" REF="005285_0008_1017168344681CE0">mean, our Actions in our particular Callings; and by our Di|ver&s;ions, our turning a&s;ide from them, whether in the pre&s;cri|bed &s;criptural or rational Acknowledgements of the Deity, or our innocent unbending the Bow in tho&s;e lawful Amu&s;ements, which are more commonly called Diver&s;ions. The Rea&s;on of my thus &s;peaking is on the Account of the <HI>divine Divi&s;ion. Six Days &s;hall thou Labour. But on the Seventh</HI>&mdash;. God who be&s;t knew our Capacities, has delineated our Bu&s;ine&s;s [or that which we are Statedly to employ mo&s;t of our Time in, for that I call, mu&s;t call &s;o] <HI>God</HI> confirms the Divi&s;ion both by Pre|cept and Example: And if we throw off Supper&s;tition and allow our &s;elves to think freely we &s;hall be confirmed that Bu&s;ine&s;s is Part of our Religion.]</P>
<P>To return then,</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider the Univer&s;e in its pre&s;ent State and Situation.</P>
<P>All the heavenly Bodies keep their Cour&s;e, [but their Orbits are more or le&s;s Excentric] The ri&s;ing SUN calls Man forth to his Bu&s;ine&s;s. The <HI>Sun</HI> withdraws, and lengthning Shades for, warn us of the ri&s;ing Damp, and unhealthy Vapour; and bid us retire for Re&s;t and Shelter. Yet if &s;omething uncom|mon, call us longer abroad, the <HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>Stars</HI> will lend a little of their <HI>barrowed</HI> Light; but amphibious Creatures, Birds and Bea&s;ts of Prey, oft check our Improvidence or Negligence. The Sun gives us our longe&s;t Days when the Earth requires mo&s;t of our Labour, and when &s;he refu&s;es Produce, he &s;hort|ens our Hours of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>So the va&s;t Collection of Waters &s;ometimes heaves in its briny Billow, &s;wells every Bay, and ru&s;hes with Joy tho' every Channel; as from an Engine played by the Almighty Arm; then &s;inks into her deep Caverns, leaves Room for the Return of the rapid Rivers; with va&s;t Additions from in-land Oceans.</P>
<P>The Winds al&s;o take their turns for Labour and Re&s;t. The laborious Ea&s;t &s;ends gently in the va&s;t Magazines of floating Wealth, to the favourite Sons of Fortune; while he is gather|ing up the &s;cattering Clouds, which he &s;hoves in upon the cra|ving Land, and genreou&s;ly pours down a more univer&s;al Ble&s;|&s;ing: and retires, when the bri&s;k We&s;t opens a Glene, &s;catters the broken Cloud, and &s;weeps up the redundant Moi&s;ture ****.</P>
<P>So the Earth <HI>here</HI> rai&s;es a rocky Mountain with a frowning Front; and levels <HI>there</HI> a plea&s;ant Plain; <HI>here</HI> &s;inks a ru&s;hy
<PB N="10" REF="005285_0009_10171685D1E6DAF0">Fea, <HI>there</HI> rai&s;es a fertile Field: <HI>Here</HI> the &s;truggling Streams ru&s;h down a rapid River, <HI>there</HI> the ea&s;y Waters lye &s;till and move not&mdash;. But what in Nature does not? Every Thing calls for Labour, and Labour requires Re&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e uncultivated Lands call for hard Labour, but &s;ome other Circum&s;tances admit of Diver&s;ion; for this the half tam'd <HI>Deer</HI> graze your Plains, and the rough <HI>Bear</HI> infe&s;t dome&s;tick Folds. The ingenious Dr. <HI>Woodward</HI> has &s;hown what Con|vul&s;ions there were at the Time of the Deluge, and how Sterile the Earth is made by that awful Event; and this to make us Labour, becau&s;e our &s;inful Propen&s;ity required it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Speaking of the old World, he &s;ays that after the Fall of Man, "The&s;e exuberant Productions of the Earth became a continual Decay and Snare to him, they only excited and fomented his Lu&s;ts, and mini&s;tred Fuel to his Vices and Luxury, and the Earth requiring little or no Tillage, there was little Occa&s;ion for Labour, &s;o that al|mo&s;t the whole Time lay upon his Hand, and gave him Lie&s;ure to contrive; and full Swing to pur&s;ue his Follies; and the Pravity of humane Nature was &mdash; The Pravity of humane Nature is not, I fear, le&s;s yet then it was then&mdash; And to remove the Temptation and Cau&s;e of the Sin, he brought this Change, by mingling and confounding its fir&s;t con&s;tituent Principles &mdash; That by this Means a great Part of their Time might be taken up, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>

<P>But we are &s;ocial Creatures; and the Cord of Society is &s;trengthned by Indu&s;try. In this defective State, great Dili|gence is nece&s;&s;ary in Education, in Purging out Prejudices, Infu&s;ing Principles and Maxims of Wi&s;dom; and acquiring Habits of ju&s;t Rea&s;oning, and prudent Determining in every Occurrence. It's needful that &s;ome &s;hould make a Bu&s;ine&s;s of Teaching; and the Labour of others mu&s;t Support &s;uch in their Labour.</P>
<P>Government is nece&s;&s;ary to good Order; to &s;ecure our Lives, Property and Peace: And tho&s;e who are by divine Providence, &s;et in Authority over us, &s;hould be e&s;teemed and honoured; that they may be &s;o, they &s;hould be &s;et above Contempt, by a
<PB N="11" REF="005285_0010_101716885BD2C5B0">generous Support from the Society whom they &s;erve: which it never can do unle&s;s Indu&s;trious.</P>
<P>Seeing we are to con&s;ider GOD, not only as Creator of Man, but as the Founder of Society, and it mu&s;t follow that a &s;ocial Homage is his Due; and this Homage mu&s;t be paid in the be&s;t, the mo&s;t regular and rational manner: It appears by the Light of Nature, and Suffrage of all Nations, that there &s;hould be &s;ome Per&s;ons &s;tated and appointed to lead Societies in their De|votions; to keep the Knowledge of God, and our Duty to him, clear from all Confu&s;ions and unworthy Conceptions, and to excite religious Sentiments <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This requires the Labour and Study of &s;uch Per&s;ons, and the Labour of others to &s;upport them. So that unle&s;s we would have Ignorance and Irreligion, and all Manner of Mi&s;eries and Mi&s;chiefs infe&s;t Mankind, we mu&s;t labour; and as God is the Author of the Species, and Founder of our State, this Indu&s;try &s;hould be practi&s;ed with a View to his Glory, as Part of our holy Religion.</P>
<P>This Thought includes Piety, Ju&s;tice, and Charity. We mu&s;t be diligent in &s;ome lawful Calling, becau&s;e God requires it, as mere Rea&s;on &s;hews, &s;o doth the Scriptures.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who will take no Method for their own Support, rob Society, or murder them&s;elves: If a Man provide not for him&s;elf, he either &s;tarves or pillages his Neighbour: I can call it nothing le&s;s than Robbery, if he could, by any lawful Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, have &s;upported him&s;elf; for he is as really a Villain, who, without my knowing it, picks my Pocket, as he who &s;ternly &s;ays, <HI>Stand and Deliver!</HI> And whatever I am obliged by Authority to pay towards the Support of Religion, Govern|ment, or the Poor, more than I &s;hould or ought to have done, if my Neighbour had been indu&s;trious, they really rob me of; for I have &s;o much le&s;s of E&s;tate thro' their Negligence. &mdash;The Equity of that Precept is clear, <HI>He that will not work, neither let him eat.</HI> And it's as evidently ju&s;t, he that will not labour to &s;upport Government, forfeits it's Protection and Favour.</P>
<P>The Man who will not labour, often thinks him&s;elf forced to lie long in his Neighbour's Debt; which is a great Piece of Inju&s;tice to his Neighbour and to Society: Seeing if his indu&s;|trious Neighbour had his Money in his Hand, he would have turn'd it to the Increa&s;e of his E&s;tate, and Emolument of the
<PB N="12" REF="005285_0011_1017168C84362FA0">Community. It's thro' Idlene&s;s that Men have little to di&s;po&s;e of, and are tempted to a&s;k &s;uch exorbitant Prices for their Wares. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There has been long and tedious Di&s;putes about a Medi|um of Trade, and a &s;ad Complaint of the con&s;tant Falling of Money: While the Prices of the Produce of the Coun|try are under no Regulation by Law: Every one almo&s;t will make it a Rule, <HI>to &s;ell as dear as he can:</HI> And if they a&s;k an <HI>Angel</HI> this Year, for that which might have been purcha&s;ed with a <HI>Crown</HI> la&s;t, an Angel is worth no more now than a Crown was then; and Money mu&s;t continue falling. It's worthy the Tho't of con&s;iderate Men, whether a Want of Labourers be not at the Bottom of all this. If Men don't labour, they vainly complain of hard Times, and Sarcity of Money; for they have no|thing to procure it.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Original of Communities, are Families. In the&s;e are weak and feeble Members, who need Labour for their Support: And that Man is not only unju&s;t, but barbarous and cruel, who neglects them. <HI>He that provideth not for his own, e&s;peci|ally for tho&s;e of his own Hou&s;e, hath denied the Faith, and is wor&s;e than an Infidel.</HI></P>

<P>Que&s;t. <HI>The&s;e are evident, you may &s;ay, but how do they reach the Rich?</HI></P>
<P>The Rich are of the &s;ame Nature with the Poor, and &s;tand in as near Relation to God and Society as they: And in the&s;e Re&s;pects, have as much need of Bu&s;ine&s;s. Tho' Men have ever &s;o much Wealth, they &s;hould con&s;ider that Idlene&s;s and Inactivity ru&s;ts and depraves the Mind, and renders it unfit for the Service of God or Men. It either di&s;tempers the Brain with Melancholly, or fills the Body with ill Humours, and the Mind with vicious Inclinations; and either of them give Satan great Advantage again&s;t us. Be&s;ides&mdash; we are to con&s;ider Wealth as a Talent given us by God to improve, therefore the more any Man has, the more he has to turn to Advantage, which mu&s;t proportionably encrea&s;e Care and enlarge the Sphere of Action. He that &s;inks his E&s;tate thro' Indolence robs the Publick, for he cant do &s;o much for the Commonwealth. And if he only keeps the Principal, and endeavours to make no In|tere&s;t, he is an <HI>unprofitable Servant</HI> to God who intru&s;ts him, and to the Society who protects, him.</P>
<P>If we are to be Followers of God as dear Children; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflection.</NOTE> if God is an Agent; if we are to imitate him in labouring &s;ix Parts in &s;even of our Time; if the human Con&s;titution in its Original requires Change of Labour and Re&s;t; if this is the State of all Nature; if Piety to God, and Ju&s;tice and Charity to Men require La|bour;
<PB N="14" REF="005285_0013_1017168FCA3A7438">and Bu&s;ine&s;s cannot be perform'd to Advantage without &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable prudent and regular Diver&s;ion: How wild and &s;uper&s;titious are tho&s;e who would drive Per&s;ons into Mona&s;tries and Nunneries, under the Notion of their &s;pending their whole Time in Devotion? And how much better is it for Per&s;ons who are deeply in Debt, or dependent on Charity for their daily Support, to run about under the Notion of dealing with their Neigbours in &s;ome pretended Ca&s;e of Con&s;cience, pra|ting about Things <HI>which they under&s;tand not;</HI> than &s;tudy to be quiet and <HI>do their own Bu&s;ine&s;s!</HI></P>
<P>Extraordinary Religion is the mo&s;t exact Tran&s;cript of the communicable Attributes of God; and the neare&s;t Imitation of the divine Being, as far as the Dictates and Limits of our Nature, and the Rules of his holy Word. &mdash; They who are wi&s;e above what is written, will &s;oon di&s;cover their Folly: For when Super&s;tition has overwhelmed a Man's Brain, like a Child with the Rickets, his Head grows too big for his Body, and the di&s;tempered Creature &s;oon dwindles away to nothing. For Men in vain plead for &s;uch Devotion as robs Society, &s;uch as defrauds Mankind. &mdash; <HI>He that loves not his Brother whom he hath &s;een, how &s;hall he love God whom he hath not &s;een.</HI></P>
<P>Weak Per&s;ons are apt to &s;ay, Can we do too much for God? Can we &s;pend too much Time in Religion? No, you cannot. But you may di&s;obey God, when you think you obey him: You may do what he forbids, when you think you do what he requires. You may be idolatrous, when you think you are mighty devout. Why, your Ance&s;tors tho't this might be; Why el&s;e did they reject the exorbitant Number of popi&s;h Fa&s;t and Fe&s;tivals, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> In one Century you &s;eem to have forgot your Errand to <HI>America.</HI> And what do you think of tho&s;e <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who &s;acrificed their Children, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> Do you think that they could do too much for God?

They like Holidays extreamly, and might be glad if every Day were &s;uch; but can, with a good Con&s;ci|ence, lie in Debt from Year to Year. It's an ea&s;y Matter to pray, and read, and hear, and talk devoutly; but to work is hard, 'tis tedious to the poor Carca&s;s, a Wearine&s;s to the Fle&s;h! It's an ea&s;y Matter to run down your indu&s;trious Neighbour as a worldly Man, but have you paid him that which you owed him? Is not he fore'd, in great Part, to &s;upport your Family?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h Men would know what Religion is in the Whole, and not &s;et the &s;everal Parts of it at Variance, and make one Branch militate with another. <HI>Let us love God with all our Hearts,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time remember that we are to <HI>love our Neighbour as our&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>Let us meditate on and long after Heaven; but know at the &s;ame Time, that our Way thither is thro' the Earth: That the Soul is infinitely the &s;uperiour Part, but if we murder the Body, the Soul mu&s;t eternally be damned.

In &s;hort, Let every Command have its proper Weight with us, every Duty it's Proportion of our Time and Tho'ts.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s and Diver&s;ion, in the general, may be allowed as innocent and nece&s;&s;ary. But &s;ome Enterprizes which wear that Name may be &s;erupled. We may therefore enquire in particular,</P>

II. <HI>Whether Fi&s;hing is lawful as Bu&s;ine&s;s or Diver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Not only tho&s;e called Religious, among the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI> and the <HI>Benjans,</HI> &amp;c. have &s;crupled eating of Fle&s;h or Fi&s;h, but &s;ome among our&s;elves, fear whether we ought to take away the Lives of Creatures for our own Support; and are po&s;itive that we &s;hould not for Diver&s;ion. Many have a great Aver&s;ion to tho&s;e who&s;e Trade it is to take away the Lives of the lower Species of Creatures. A Butcher is (in their Apprehen&s;ion) a mere Mon&s;ter, and a Fi&s;herman, a filthy Wretch.</P>
<P>It's an ancient Ob&s;ervation, that <HI>a merciful Man is merciful to his Bea&s;t. The righteous Man regards the Life of his Bea&s;t,</HI> Prov. xii. 10. Where any have long u&s;ed any Creature, the Tho't of it's Service, and &s;ome &s;ort of Regard contracted to it thereby, is not ea&s;ily conquered. But a noble generous Soul hates Barbarity to foreign as well as dome&s;tick Creatures. <Q>It's not certain [&s;ays my Lord BEACON] that the wor|thier any Soul is, the larger is it's Compa&s;&s;ion. For con|tracted degenerate Minds imagine that tho&s;e Things belong not to them: But the Mind that looks upon it&s;elf as a nobler Portion of the Univer&s;e, is kindly affected towards inferiour Creatures&mdash;.</Q></P>
<P>He that takes Plea&s;ure in the Pains and dying Agonies of any lower Species of Creatures, is either a &s;tupid &s;ordid Soul, or a Murderer in Heart.&mdash;He that delighteth to &s;ee a Brute die, would &s;oon take as great Plea&s;ure in the Death of a Man.</P>
<P>But here, <HI>in Fi&s;hing,</HI> we are &s;o far from delighting to &s;ee our Fellow-Creature die, that we hardly think whether they live&mdash;We have no more of a murderous Tho't in taking them, than in cutting up a Me&s;s a Herbage. We are taking &s;omething, which God, the Creator and Proprietor of all, has given us to u&s;e for Food, as freely as the <HI>green Herb.</HI> Gen. ix. 2, 3.</P>
<P>He allows the eating them, therefore the mere catching them is no Barbarity. Be&s;ides God &s;eems to have carv'd out the Globe on purpo&s;e for a univer&s;al Supply: In Seas, near Shores, are Banks and Beds made for them;&mdash;to furni&s;h the Lands adjacent&mdash;and Lands which lye remote, are more divided into Lakes and Ponds, Brooks and Rivers; and he has im|planted in &s;everal Sorts of Fi&s;h, a &s;trong In&s;tinct [or Inclination] to &s;wim up the&s;e Rivers a va&s;t Di&s;tance from the Sea. And
<PB N="17" REF="005285_0016_101716994D9E7B10">is it not remarkable, that Rivers mo&s;t incumbred with Falls, are ever more full of Fi&s;h than others. Why are they directed here? Why retarded by the&s;e difficult Pa&s;&s;ages? But to &s;upply the Inlands? Does forming and di&s;po&s;ing of the&s;e Things argue nothing?</P>
<P>Since the Flood the Earth is more barren, and Vegetables afford not a &s;ufficient Support for Mankind.&mdash;So that if the Lives of all the&s;e are of le&s;s Con&s;equence, nay, are freely given by him who&s;e they are, they may be taken and u&s;ed as Food: If they <HI>may</HI> be taken, any may make a Bu&s;ine&s;s of taking them for the Supply of others.</P>
<P>But if this be innocent as Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ome may &s;till &s;cruple it as Diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>And why not all Diver&s;ion with as good Rea&s;on? The grave and judicious Mr. <HI>Perkins</HI> &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See his Works,</HI> Vol. 2. p. 140.</NOTE> <Q>We are allowed to u&s;e the Creatures of God, not only for our Nece&s;&s;ity, but for meet and convenient Delight. This is a confe&s;&s;ed Truth. And therefore to them who &s;hall condemn fit and conveni|ent Recreation (as &s;ome of the ancient Fathers have done, by Name <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> and <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI>) it may be &s;aid, be not too righteous, be not too wi&s;e, <HI>Eccl.</HI> vii. 16.</Q> But if we con&s;ider, that the End of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Diver&s;ion are the &s;ame, we &s;hall clearly conceive the Truth. The End of both are the Refre&s;hment and Support of Man in the Service of God. If I may eat them for Refre&s;hment, I may as well catch them, if this recreate and refre&s;h me. It's as lawful to delight the Eye, as the Palate. All Plea&s;ure ari&s;es from the Suitablene&s;s and Agreablene&s;s between the perceptive Faculties, and the Ob|ject; that affect them: And our bountiful Maker, as he has given the animal Life many perceptive Faculties, the Sen&s;es of Seeing, Hearing, Ta&s;ting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o he has provided &s;uitably Ob|jects for all the&s;e Faculties, and does allow us to gratify our&s;elves therewith.</P>
<P>When the Body has been long wearied with Labour, or the Mind weakned with Devotion, it's requi&s;ite to give them Ea&s;e; then the u&s;e of innocent and moderate Plea&s;ures and Recreations is both u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary, to Soul and Body; it enlivens Na|ture, recruits our Spirits, and renders us more able to &s;et about

<P>&mdash;That I may not be tedious, I will only lead in your Reflections a Word or two.</P>
<P>Religion is the highe&s;t Rea&s;on, and Chri&s;tianity perfectly &s;uited to Man in his pre&s;ent State. And as the venerable Judge <HI>Hale</HI> &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contemplations, la&s;t Part, <HI>p.</HI> 254.</NOTE> <Q>Religion is be&s;t in its <HI>Simplicity</HI> and <HI>Purity,</HI> but difficult to be retain'd &s;o, without Super&s;titions and Acce&s;&s;ions; and tho&s;e do commonly in Time <HI>&s;tifle</HI> and <HI>cheak</HI> the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of Religion, unle&s;s much Care and Cir|cum&s;pection be u&s;ed: The Contemporations are &s;o many and &s;o cumber&s;ome, that Religion loo&s;eth its <HI>Nature,</HI> or is &s;trangled by them: Ju&s;t like a Man that hath &s;ome excel|lent &s;imple Cordial or Spirit, and puts Mu&s;k in it to make it &s;mell &s;weet, and Honey to make it ta&s;te plea&s;ant, and it may be <HI>Cantharides</HI> to make it look glorious. Indeed by the Infu&s;ions he hath given it a very fine <HI>Ta&s;te, Smell,</HI> and <HI>Colour,</HI> but yet he hath &s;o clogg'd it, and <HI>&s;ophi&s;ticated</HI> it with <HI>Superaddition,</HI> that it may be he hath altered the Na|ture, and de&s;troy'd the Vertue o&s; it.</Q> Some &s;o muffle up Chri&s;tianity, and make it look &s;o melancholy, &s;ickly and &s;owr, that incon&s;iderate People are apt to dread it Command, as they would the Tyranny of <HI>Sallee-Men.</HI> But</P>
<P>What prodigious Inju&s;tice is hereby done to the mo&s;t &s;acred and excellent Cau&s;e in the World?</P>
<P>Such zealous, weak, mi&s;taken Men can't ea&s;ily be per&s;waded of the Di&s;&s;imilitude there is between <HI>their</HI> Opinion and Prac|tice, and the Doctrine and Behaviour or <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>his Apo&s;iles.</HI> It were worthy of their diligent Application, to make a criti|cal Attempt of running the Parralel. And they would certain|ly find their own Lives awkward and disjointed; and their Notions, in this Part, maim'd and defective, and bloated and &s;well'd in that. They would find likewi&s;e, that they have given them&s;elves and others a great deal of unnece&s;&s;ary Fatigue and Perplexity: Wearying them&s;elves and tormenting others, by making tho&s;e Things Duties, which God never requir'd,
<PB N="20" REF="005285_0019_101716A1EA52A3F8">and forbidding tho&s;e Things which God never prohibited: Perplexing them&s;elves and all around them with infinite Doubts and Fears, without any Foundation: Leading Men into the mo&s;t loo&s;ing Labyrinths, for which there can be no Clue found, by in the Traces of their own maz'd Brain.</P>
<P>Therefore, How needful is it that we be well acquainted with the Scriptures, inform'd in the Religion of Je&s;us, con|form'd to the Example of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles? There we &s;hall &s;ee the Nature and De&s;ign of Chri&s;tianity. &mdash;To bring <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, &mdash;Peace and Good will to Men.</HI> That God's Glory and his Good&mdash;his Duty and Intere&s;t&mdash; Piety and Plea&s;ure, can never be &s;undered.</P>
<P>He will find, that in order to an Action's being term'd really religious, the Principle from which, and the End for which it is done, is much more to be con&s;idered, than whether it com|monly fall under the Denomination of Devotion, Bu&s;ine&s;s, or Diver&s;ion; for they are all at one Time or other our Duty: And the doing our Duty from a good Principle and for a right End, mu&s;t be term'd religious acting. Eating and Drinking are natural and &s;en&s;ible Actions, but when <HI>we cat</HI> and <HI>drink</HI> to the <HI>Glory of God,</HI> they are to be con&s;idered as religious, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 31. and that not only when Men eat and drink the meane&s;t for Quality, and the lea&s;t for Quantity that can &s;upport them in the Service of God and Society but when they have a rich and plentiful Collation: A <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Cana</HI> of <HI>Galilee,</HI> they had a Plenty of rich Wines <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> provided by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who made one of the Company <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> this chearful Entertainment. This was at a Wedding, which is not every Day. <Q>No Man &s;hould make Sports his Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor Pa&s;times his Employ|ment no more than Cordials his Drink, or Sauces his Meat.</Q> This de&s;troys the very Notion of Diver&s;ion. Says Mr. <HI>Lock,</HI> <Q>Some Men may be &s;aid never to divert them&s;elves, they can't <HI>turn a&s;ide from Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> for they never do any.</Q> <HI>To every Thing there is a Sea&s;on,</HI> Eccl. iii. 1,&mdash;4.</P>
<P>Should we not always in every Enterprize wi&s;h for the Pre|&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ing of Chri&s;t? Methinks tho&s;e who love and adore the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us &s;hould de&s;ire to &s;ee him every where, and in every Thing! who calls for our Devotion and allows our Diver&s;ion! who procured Peace and Plea&s;ure for wretched &s;inful Men!

Books and Learning, and polite Company, and refin'd Science, are the more elegant Joys of ingenious Spirits: The&s;e are en|ticing Gratifications of the Sen&s;es or the Mind of Man; they are all innocent in them&s;elves, they may be &s;anctified to divine Purpo&s;es, and afford double Satisfaction if God be among them: But if God be ab&s;ent, if he hide his Face or frown upon the Soul, not Palaces, nor Groves, nor Fields, nor Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor Diver&s;ion, nor all the flowry or ta&s;teful Ble&s;&s;ings of Spring or Summer, nor the more refin'd Joys of Books and Learning, and elegant Company; not all the rich Provi&s;ion of Nature and Art, can entertain or refre&s;h, can &s;atisfy or plea&s;e the Sould of a Chri&s;tian&mdash;when &s;mitten with the Love of God.</Q></P>
<P>To conclude, Let us ever remember that <HI>we</HI> and <HI>all we have,</HI> is God's, and that we are accountable to him for our Im|provement of all, and depend on Chri&s;t for our Acceptance with him in all.</P>
