<P>_MANY excellent <HI>Pens,</HI> in our <HI>Nation,</HI> have of late Years appeared in De|fence of <HI>Divine Revelation;</HI> which has been boldly attack'd, openly in&s;ulted, and &s;ometimes profanely ridicul'd, by the <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> of the pre&s;ent Day; with a Pre|tence to <HI>&s;uperior</HI> Under&s;tanding and Judgment, and <HI>Freedom</HI> of Thinking; as if all be&s;ide <HI>Them&s;elves</HI> were hoodwink'd and &s;hackled by <HI>Prejudices of E|ducation,</HI> or corrupted and re&s;trained by <HI>Worldly

<P>Great has been the <HI>Provocation</HI> to an&s;wer &s;ome of the more <HI>licentious</HI> and &s;currilous <HI>Advocates</HI> for Infidelity according to their <HI>Folly,</HI> le&s;t they be wi&s;e in their own Conceit: But great has been the <HI>Guard</HI> and Caution on the part of the noble and &s;erious <HI>Defenders</HI> of the Divine Authority of the <HI>Bible,</HI> to write with Decency and Ju&s;tice, Re|verence and Gravity, Rea&s;on and Argument, on a Subject of &s;o great Importance to the Honour of God and the Salvation of Souls. They have ne|verthele&s;s <HI>contended earne&s;tly for the Faith,</HI> while they have given the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of it <HI>with Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom;</HI> and Eno' has been &s;aid to <HI>convince Gain|&s;ayers,</HI> to <HI>&s;top the Mouths of unruly and vain Talkers,</HI> and to <HI>confirm the Souls of the Di&s;ciples.</HI></P>
<P>I am <HI>my Self</HI> in a particular manner obliged to mention, with great Acknowledgment, the Plea&s;ure and Benefit I found in reading Dr. <HI>Thomas Burnet</HI>'s Demon&s;tration of true Religion in a Chain of Scrip|ture Con&s;equences; and a later <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Revela|tion examin'd with Candour;</HI> to which the follow|ing <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation</HI> owes its Ri&s;e. It pretends not to any like <HI>Elaboratene&s;s,</HI> but is written for People of a lower Rank, who cannot ri&s;e to the <HI>Price</HI> of the fore-named Books. We write for the <HI>Places</HI> where we live, and for the <HI>People</HI> to whom we belong; and at the Reque&s;t of <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> to whom the follow|ing <HI>Pages</HI> were acceptable and profitable from the <HI>Pulpit</HI> under another <HI>Form,</HI> I now publi&s;h them in <HI>this</HI> of a <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation</HI> on the <HI>fir&s;t Chapters of the</HI> BIBLE.</P>
<P>If <HI>the&s;e fir&s;t Pages in the Book of God</HI> do not appear worthy of his <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> we may even give up the Re&s;t of the <HI>Bible.</HI> If God has not
<PB N="3" REF="003887_0006_10020C46098C84E0">&s;poken to us by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> neither has He by the fol|lowing <HI>Prophets;</HI> no, nor by JESUS and his <HI>A|po&s;tles.</HI> But if it be Evident that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> wrote by In&s;piration of God, it is a &s;ure and &s;trong <HI>Foun|dation</HI> for, and <HI>Argument</HI> of the Credibility of the whole Sacred <HI>Scriptures</HI> of the <HI>Old and New Te&s;ta|ment;</HI> which we find bearing a &s;trict <HI>Reference</HI> unto, <HI>Agreement</HI> with, and to be the <HI>Fulfilment</HI> of what <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> has written.</P>
<P>The whole of <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> the whole Doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> &s;tands on this Foot. The <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> all bear Witne&s;s to the Wri|tings of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> The <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> ends with this, <HI>"Remember the Law of Mo&s;es my Servant!</HI> and the <HI>New</HI> begins and ends with the like Te&s;timony to <HI>Him</HI> as In&s;pired of God, and &s;ent by Him. It begins with leading us back to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Joh. v. 39, 45, &amp;c. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and The&s;e are they that te&s;tify of Me: Do not think that I will accu&s;e you unto the Father; there is one that accu&s;eth you, even Mo&s;es, in whom ye tru&s;t: For had ye believed Mo&s;es ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me; But if ye believe not his Writings, how &s;hall ye believe my Words?</HI> &mdash; And if we look to the <HI>Clo&s;e</HI> of our <HI>Bi|ble,</HI> we find it ending with <HI>"the Song of Mo&s;es and the Lamb.</HI></P>
<P>I will not go into the <HI>Honours of Mo&s;es,</HI> as they are deliver'd to us in the Sacred Pages, le&s;t it &s;hould &s;eem a <HI>begging the Que&s;tion</HI> before us; but let us only open our <HI>Bibles</HI> and read the &s;hort <HI>Narrative</HI> given of the <HI>Creation</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> and of <HI>Man</HI> upon it, his <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> and &s;ee whether it be not mo&s;t worthy of the <HI>Maje&s;ty, Holine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> of the MOST HIGH; the mo&s;t fit and proper <HI>Beginning</HI> of a <HI>Revelation</HI> of God to Man.</P>

The fir&s;t Book of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is <HI>Hi&s;torical.</HI> And it is the grand Honour of <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> that the <HI>Revelations</HI> of God begin thus. And if we weigh the Thing well we mu&s;t needs judge that the In&s;pired <HI>Oracles</HI> mu&s;t &s;o begin. Lap&s;ed and ignorant <HI>Mankind</HI> by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Time needed a <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of their <HI>own</HI> Begin|ning, their <HI>fir&s;t</HI> State and the <HI>Origine</HI> of Evil. And this mu&s;t be a <HI>Doctrinal Hi&s;tory,</HI> concerning GOD and <HI>Them&s;elves; how</HI> God made <HI>Them</HI> and all Things <HI>very good; what</HI> He made 'em <HI>for,</HI> and what He required of them; <HI>how</HI> they came into their pre&s;ent State of Sin and Mi&s;ery, and what <HI>Way</HI> there is for their <HI>Recovery</HI> out of it. This is the <HI>Argument</HI> and Sub&s;tance of the Book of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> and more e&s;pecially of the <HI>fir&s;t three Chapters</HI> of it.</P>
<P>GOD there informs us fir&s;t concerning HIMSELF, his Own ETERNAL BEING AND GODHEAD, and then concerning his <HI>Works,</HI> the Origine of the <HI>World,</HI> and the Manner and End of <HI>our own</HI> Formation. In what other, or better Manner, can we think that a Revelation from God &s;hould begin? The <HI>fir&s;t Ver&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Bible</HI> &s;hows it to be the <HI>Book of God: "In the Beginning God created the Hea|vens and the Earth.</HI> What, but <HI>this,</HI> &s;hould be the <HI>fir&s;t Line of Scripture?</HI> The DIVINE MAJESTY here &s;peaks of <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> as the <HI>Fir&s;t Cau&s;e</HI> of all Things; That <HI>of Him and to Him are all Things,</HI> and <HI>for His Plea&s;ure they are and were created.</HI> The <HI>one</HI> only true Foundation of all <HI>Science</HI> and of all <HI>Religion.</HI> It was not po&s;&s;ible for <HI>Man</HI> to know any thing aright concerning Him&s;elf, or the Vi&s;ible Works of God, till he knew this. <HI>This</HI> is the <HI>I|mage</HI> and <HI>Super&s;cription</HI> of God upon the <HI>Bible</HI> in the fir&s;t Line of it. God being to write <HI>His Book,</HI> for the U&s;e of the Sons of Men, thro' all Genera|tions, put his <HI>Name</HI> before it in the&s;e Words, <HI>In the Beginning GOD created the Heavens and the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003887_0008_10020C4BD04F2FA8">
GOD is here repre&s;ented as <HI>Self-Exi&s;ient,</HI> and in <HI>his own Times,</HI> as the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate,</HI> giving unto all Things their Exi&s;tence and <HI>Being,</HI> vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible; by an Act of his <HI>Will,</HI> and a <HI>Word</HI> of his Power. How well does this fir&s;t Line of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> agree to the <HI>P&s;alm</HI> which bears his Name? P&s;al. xc. 2, 4. <HI>Before the Mountains were bro't forth, or ever Thou had&s;t formed the Earth and the World, from Everla&s;ting to Everla&s;ting Thou art God: For a thou&s;and Years in thy Sight are but as Ye&s;terday when it is pa&s;t, and as a Watch in the Night.</HI> The <HI>Eternal</HI> God &s;peaks by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> of His own Eternity, how He was before all Things; and the <HI>Infinite</HI> God &s;peaks of his own Infinity, his infinite Power which <HI>by a Word</HI> bro't the vi&s;ible Heavens and Earth into their Being and Order; fir&s;t command|ed the <HI>Matter</HI> into Being, &s;ufficient for the form|ing the <HI>Univer&s;e,</HI> and then &s;pake it into that <HI>Beauty</HI> and comely Proportion which our Eyes behold.&mdash; What, <HI>but This,</HI> ought the fir&s;t Line of &s;acred Scripture to contain? He that does not &s;ee or read <HI>God</HI> in it is blind; and he that does not hear God &s;peaking in it of Him&s;elf, has no Under&s;tanding of what he hears. The God of infinite Wi&s;dom, Power and Goodne&s;s &s;peaks of the&s;e his immen&s;e Perfections, in the&s;e <HI>few</HI> Words, as plainly and copiou&s;ly as if <HI>Volumes</HI> were writ of them.</P>
<P><HI>In the Beginning,</HI> &s;oil, of the <HI>Univer&s;e;</HI> when the <HI>Worlds</HI> came into Being, the upper and the lower; it was meerly by the Sovereign <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> of the LORD GOD; at what <HI>Time</HI> and in what <HI>Order. The&s;e Worlds</HI> had their Beginning, but GOD had none. God gave Them their Exi&s;tence, <HI>when, where</HI> and <HI>how</HI> it plea&s;ed Him; and made all mo&s;t <HI>good</HI> and <HI>perfect,</HI> for His <HI>Own</HI> Prai&s;e and Glory. There was <HI>no other</HI> Will, Wi&s;dom, Good|ne&s;s or Power to do this, but His who is THE ETER|NAL;

<P>This is but a ju&s;t <HI>Paraphra&s;e</HI> on the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Line of <HI>Scripture,</HI> which is <HI>Immen&s;e</HI> in Sen&s;e. The <HI>Fulne&s;s</HI> of the Eternal GODHEAD is in it, and <HI>all Things</HI> that God has made are in it too.&mdash;One might dwell and expatiate on this <HI>fir&s;t Word of Mo&s;es</HI> for Ever, and never be able to think or &s;ay any thing on it adequate to the Fulne&s;s of Sen&s;e and Spirit in it.&mdash; In what <HI>other</HI> Words could the <HI>Book of God</HI> begin? O the Height and Depth, the Length and Breadth of this <HI>one</HI> Line! <HI>It is Light, without any Darkne&s;s at all!</HI> GOD dwells and &s;hines in it! It is <HI>Light unapprochable and full of Glory!</HI> Here is the Be|ginning and Fini&s;hing of the <HI>Creation</HI> of God in a Single Line! And then the DIVINE SPIRIT de&s;cends to that Part and <HI>Point</HI> of the Creation that belongs to <HI>Man,</HI> our <HI>Earth,</HI> and proceeds to &s;peak of it.</P>
<P>Ver. 2. <HI>And the Earth was without Form and void, and Darkne&s;s was upon the Face of the Deep.</HI> This we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, unle&s;s we &s;hould rather think it becoming the Glory of God to give every <HI>Globe</HI> in the Univer&s;e its <HI>perfect</HI> Form at once. He could indeed as ea&s;ily have done this, but I think the Glory of Divine Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s more di&s;|played in the <HI>gradual Proce&s;s</HI> related by <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> God had fir&s;t created the <HI>Heavens</HI> and Ho&s;ts of glorious <HI>Angels,</HI> a World of bright <HI>Intelligences</HI> to behold the lower Worlds, take their Place, Form and Motion. And as the&s;e were fini&s;hing from Day to Day, one Part after another, and every Part more and more perfective of the Whole, tho&s;e <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Spectators &s;ang together</HI> and &s;houted forth the Prai&s;es of that infinite Perfection, which they &s;aw with Wonder in every &s;tep: As we read <HI>Job</HI> xxxviii. 7.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t perfect <HI>Idea</HI> that the Mind of Man can now frame concerning the Formation of our <HI>Earth,</HI> and &s;o of the other <HI>Planets</HI> within our
<PB N="7" REF="003887_0010_10020CA2468E63F8"><HI>Circle,</HI> is <HI>this,</HI> "That they were fir&s;t <HI>a Chaos,</HI> or confus'd Particles of watry, oily, earthly, aery, and fiery Matter, blended together, without any di&s;tinct Order, Form or Beauty, a dark&s;ome <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> and Deep, which we &s;hould have been ready to think could never be bro't into any Order, Come|line&s;s and U&s;e.

<P>And now, what would a con&s;idering <HI>Angel</HI> think &s;hould be the <HI>fir&s;t Thing produced,</HI> or call'd forth in|to &s;ome Appearance, out of this Darkne&s;s and Di&s;|order? What &s;hould it be but LIGHT? And <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tells us <HI>this</HI> was it, Ver. 3. <HI>And GOD &s;aid, Let there be Light, and there was Light.</HI></P>
<P>Did <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> conceive this? wi&s;e as he was and penetrating, even as an <HI>Angel</HI> of God, and learn|ed in all the Phylo&s;ophy of <HI>Egypt?</HI> No, it was be|yond the Ken of any humane Mind or Wi&s;dom. How is it &s;poken <HI>like a GOD!</HI> and how <HI>God-like</HI> is the Account of the Production of one Thing and another? <HI>"GOD &s;aid, Let</HI> there be this and that! and <HI>let</HI> it be thus and thus!

And yet we cannot now po&s;&s;ibly conceive of any other <HI>Man|ner</HI> of Working worthy of the great GOD! and therefore we know that God &s;pake by <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Of all vi&s;ible, <HI>material</HI> Things, which &s;hould be <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in Order of <HI>Time,</HI> and which is fir&s;t in Order

<P>That <HI>fir&s;t Light</HI> was plea&s;ant to the &s;urrounding Ho&s;ts of <HI>Angels,</HI> how far &s;oever it was below <HI>That</HI> of <HI>their</HI> Cele&s;tial Regions.

<P><HI>GOD is Light.</HI> So He repre&s;ents Him&s;elf unto us, becau&s;e Light is the <HI>fir&s;t-born</HI> of the Vi&s;ible Creation.

<P>GOD is the <HI>Father of Light, from Whom every good and perfect Gift comes down; and with Him there is no Variablene&s;s, nor Shadow of Change.</HI> So in the <HI>New Creation</HI> Light is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Thing formed.

<P>The <HI>Order</HI> of the Creation is <HI>admirable</HI> and <HI>per|fect</HI> as it is related by <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> yet it could not have enter'd into the Heart of <HI>Man</HI> to have conceived of it, if God had not revealed it to Him.

<P>But as yet no <HI>Eye</HI> was formed to behold and view them; no not &s;o much as the Eye of a <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> in the Waters of an <HI>Animal</HI> on the Land, or of an <HI>In&s;ect</HI> in the Air. Now therefore it plea&s;ed God to command the Waters to bring forth the <HI>moving Creatures</HI> in them, great and &s;mall; and the <HI>Fowl</HI> to fly in the open Firmament.

<P>God made 'em to <HI>propagate</HI> their Life; to in|crea&s;e, multiply in, and repleni&s;h the Sea, the Air and Earth. He added his <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> on Them for this End, which is effectual to this Day, and with|out which every living Thing had been <HI>barren</HI> and

<P>This Power and Goodne&s;s <HI>inexhau&s;tible</HI> flowed on, and ro&s;e higher and higher, till the <HI>dry Land</HI> was al&s;o &s;tor'd with <HI>Bea&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Cattle</HI> and <HI>every creeping Thing</HI> after their Kind; and then MAN was la&s;t of all formed, with a <HI>Solemnity</HI> and <HI>Plea|&s;ure</HI> peculiar to the <HI>Superior Creature</HI> on Earth; de&s;igned to be the <HI>Lord</HI> of all the Creatures in Air, on Earth and in the Seas, and to bear the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Likene&s;s</HI> of the CREATOR of all.

The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> tells us that <HI>this</HI> was the Image and Likene&s;s of God, wherein Man was created, and to which He is in part re&s;tored in his Sanctification.

<P>MAN is a <HI>living Soul,</HI> not only in re&s;pect of Im|mortality, but as he is an <HI>Intelligent, Self-con&s;cious</HI> Creature, made a <HI>Law</HI> to Him&s;elf, and for <HI>Self-Government;</HI> an Agent by Coun&s;el, accountable to <HI>God,</HI> to his own <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> and to the <HI>Societies</HI> to which he belongs.

<PB N="13" REF="003887_0016_10020CAD4E978CC8">God in his Works, nor of giving Glory to him in Acts of Wor&s;hip and Obedience.

<P>No Writer before <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> has told Mankind how they came into Being, in what a <HI>Glory</HI> they were created, in what Rectitude and Perfection.

<P>Thus <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> writes of GOD who was before the World, and of His making it in &s;uch a Manner as becomes the Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, Holine&s;s and E|ternal Power of God. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> could never have undertaken and perform'd <HI>This,</HI> but under the In|&s;piration of God. <HI>Known to</HI> HIM, and to Him alone, <HI>are all his Works from the Beginning to the End.</HI> Had <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or any <HI>One</HI> el&s;e, pre&s;um'd to have told the Manner and Order of the Creation

<P>As One &s;ays, <Q>Since <HI>Adam</HI> was confined to one Wife, it is a &s;ufficient Intimation that his <HI>Sons</HI> &s;hould be &s;o; and that the Bond of Marriage is not to be di&s;&s;olved at Plea&s;ure.</Q> So our <HI>Lord</HI> JESUS has taught us to rea&s;on; Mat. xix. 3,&mdash;8. <HI>The Phari&s;ees came unto Him, tempting him and &s;ay|ing, "Is it lawful for a Man to put away his Wife for every Cau&s;e?

By <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Account of the fir&s;t State of Man, it appears that <HI>Adam and Eve</HI> were cre|ated with <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> and <HI>Speech,</HI> and with the <HI>Powers of Rea&s;on in Perfection:</HI> Al&s;o with a Knowledge of the <HI>Brute Creatures</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>their Dominion</HI> over them: And moreover, that in Things <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for them to know, but <HI>above the Reach</HI> of Humane Under&s;tanding, they were favoured with <HI>Supernatural Revelations,</HI> or <HI>In&s;piration</HI> from on High. And certainly <HI>this</HI> is as became <HI>Him</HI> who&s;e Work is <HI>perfect,</HI> who be|held it and lo it was all <HI>very good.</HI> It was nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> to be endowed with Knowledge and Speech, and not to have The&s;e to acquire; for then had the lower Creation been without a Head or Ruler, and the Work of God had herein been greatly defective. &mdash; <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tells us therefore that as &s;oon as our fir&s;t Parents were created, <HI>God</HI> &s;pake to them, and <HI>They</HI> to one another. God made Man a <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Mouth,</HI> and in&s;pired him with a Knowledge of <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> and of his MAKER. The Man and his Wife upon the fir&s;t Sight of each other had a perfect Apprehen&s;ion of their <HI>Relation</HI> and mutual Obligations; and knew Them&s;elves to be de&s;igned <HI>Parents</HI> of a numerous Po&s;terity, to people the Earth. &mdash; They knew al&s;o, by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Account, all the <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> of the Earth; had an Un|der&s;tanding given them of the Nature of the <HI>brute Creatures;</HI> who were therefore bro't to <HI>Adam</HI> to receive their <HI>Names</HI> from him; which was his fir&s;t act of <HI>Dominion</HI> over 'em, and a wondrous Proof of their Subjection to him, and a much more won|derful Evidence of that <HI>natural Wi&s;dom and Saga|city</HI> with which he was endued: That at the fir&s;t Sight of any of the Creatures he could <HI>look into them,</HI> &s;ee their different Natures, and <HI>name</HI> them agreably.</P>

It was a my&s;terious Dominion that <HI>Adam</HI> enjoy|ed, incircled by the various inferior Creatures, the Lion and the Bear together with the Sheep and Doves, to know what he wou'd call 'em. Gen. ii. 19, 20. <HI>Out of the Ground the Lord God formed every Bea&s;t of the Field, and every Fowl of the Air, and bro't them to Adam to &s;ee what he would call them; and what&s;oever Adam called every living Creature, that was the Name thereof.</HI> Methinks the <HI>Angels</HI> mini&s;tred with Plea&s;ure on this Occa&s;ion, &amp; heard the Man give every Creature its proper Name. Or rather as One &s;ays, <Q><HI>God</HI> by a &s;pecial In&s;tinct di|rected 'em to come to Man as their Ma&s;ter and Owner. God gave him Livery and Sei&s;in of them all, as the fair and great E&s;tate he had en|dowed him with, and put him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it all. The Creatures, as it were, did Homage to Him as their <HI>Sovereign.</HI></Q> And they would have remain'd <HI>obedient</HI> to him, if he had been &s;o unto his God.

<P>See again what a mighty Knowledge <HI>Adam</HI> was in&s;pired with on <HI>his fir&s;t Sight of Eve.</HI> Read how he received Her from the Hand of God, into his own Arms. Words worthy to be written with <HI>a Pen of Gold,</HI> and graven with <HI>a Diamond</HI> on the Heart of all his Offspring. Gen. ii. 22, &mdash; 25. <HI>And the Rib which the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>had taken from Man made He a Woman, and bro't her to the Man. And Adam &s;aid, "This is now Bone of my Bone, and Fle&s;h of my Fle&s;h! She &s;hall be called Woman, be|cau&s;e &s;he was taken out of Man. Therefore &s;hall a Man leave his Father and his Mother, and &s;hall cleave unto his Wife; and They &s;hall be one Fle&s;h.

<P>Nor is it conceivable that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;hould <HI>imagine,</HI> and feign the&s;e Tho'ts for the Head and Mouth of <HI>Adam:</HI> But if <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> wrote them from God, then all is plain and ea&s;ie.

<P>And thus we &s;ee how worthy an Account we have from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> of the <HI>fir&s;t State</HI> of Man, with re&s;pect unto that <HI>Perfection</HI> of Knowledge and Wi&s;dom in which he was created.

GOD who <HI>in&s;pired Adam</HI> to &s;peak and act, <HI>revealed it to Mo&s;es;</HI> or it had never enter'd into his Heart.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s on to <HI>another</HI> Point, which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> could never have tho't of, and that is the In&s;titution of a SABBATH to Man, from the Day in which he was created; together with <HI>the Rea&s;on</HI> for God's Sanc|tifying the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> Part of Time. Gen. ii. 1, 2, 3. <HI>Thus the Heavens and the Earth were fini&s;hed, and all the Ho&s;t of them; and on the &s;eventh Day God ended his Work which he had made; and he re&s;ted on the &s;eventh Day from all his Work which he had made: And God ble&s;&s;ed the Seventh Day and &s;anctified it;

<P>It is highly agreable to <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and &s;eems to me a plain <HI>Dictate</HI> of the Religion of <HI>Nature,</HI> that <HI>&s;ome Portion of Time be &s;tatedly Holy to God,</HI> and for the Reverend <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> of Mankind, as Social Creatures<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">If God mu&s;t be wor&s;hipped, there mu&s;t be a <HI>Time</HI> for it.

The Time for Wor&s;hip &s;hould be &s;ta|ted, that it may be remembred and prepar'd for. One Day in <HI>Seven</HI> can't be tho't too much for God and our Souls.

<P>How well did this become the <HI>Proprietor</HI> and Lord of Man, <HI>Lord of his Life and Time,</HI> and of all his <HI>Powers,</HI> of Soul and Body!

<P>Here is a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on why <HI>this</HI> is the Part of Time declared to be <HI>morally Holy,</HI> and therefore to be put into the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> when given from Heaven; as <HI>Exod.</HI> xx. 11.

<P>The Sabbath was made <HI>for Man;</HI> as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has told us: Therefore as &s;oon as <HI>Man</HI> was made the <HI>Sabbath</HI> was given to him.

But <HI>holy Work is better,</HI> the Exerci&s;e and even Labour of the Mind Heart and Affections, in Contemplation Prayer and Prai&s;e, in holy Communications, in reading preaching and hearing the Word of God.

<P>If this manner of <HI>Arguing</HI> had come from the Mouth of an <HI>Infidel,</HI> I &s;hould have overlook'd the <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> of it from his <HI>Prejudice</HI> again&s;t <HI>Revelation</HI> from God; but from the Pen of a <HI>Believer</HI> and a Chri&s;tian <HI>Doctor,</HI> I can impute it to nothing but his <HI>low E&s;teem of the Sabbath,</HI> from an unhappy <HI>Edu|cation</HI> in that too common <HI>Prejudice</HI> prevailing in

<P>The Thing next related by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is that a <HI>Para|di&s;e</HI> was prepared for our <HI>fir&s;t Parents,</HI> in their State of <HI>Innocence</HI> and Rectitude. The Earth was it &s;elf indeed a Paradi&s;e, but &s;ome One of the fine&s;t and riche&s;t Spots in it was &s;ingled out for <HI>Man's</HI> fir&s;t Re&s;i|dence &amp; Dwelling. Gen. ii. 8, 15. <HI>And the Lord God planted a Garden Ea&s;tward in Eden, and there He put the Man whom he had formed; to dre&s;s it and keep it; where He had made to grow every Tree that is plea&s;ant to the Sight and good for Food.</HI></P>
<P>As the <HI>Sabbath</HI> had been given for the <HI>Soul,</HI> the better Part of Man, &s;o was this <HI>Garden</HI> prepared for him as an <HI>imbodied</HI> Spirit; to gratify his <HI>Sight,
<PB N="31" REF="003887_0034_10020C6E356C3178">Smell, Ta&s;te</HI> and <HI>Hearing;</HI> by every <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> and Bounty of God, to draw forth his Heart to Him, his magnificent and munificent CREATOR.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> walk'd together, contem|plated and di&s;cour&s;ed, eat and wor&s;hip'd. The <HI>Birds</HI> &s;ang in the Branches, the <HI>Trees</HI> were laden with painted <HI>Fruit,</HI> the <HI>Plants</HI> were covered with <HI>Flowers</HI> of the &s;weete&s;t Odour, and <HI>Streams</HI> of pure Water ran by the green &s;hady Walks. A <HI>Scene</HI> meet to typify and repre&s;ent the <HI>Heavenly Felicity,</HI> which is therefore call'd by the Name of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and figur'd out to us by the <HI>Garden of God</HI> with <HI>the Tree of Life</HI> in it. Rev. xxii. Man's fir&s;t State continued in, had been as like to <HI>Heaven</HI> for Hap|pine&s;s, as could be on Earth.</P>
<P>We read of <HI>the Trees of Eden in the Garden of God:</HI> Ezek. xxxi. 9. <HI>Eden</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI> That mu&s;t needs be a Place of <HI>Delights,</HI> which is meet to be called <HI>the Garden of God.</HI> &mdash; What a <HI>Garden</HI> was this? of God's own forming and laying out? of his own &s;ettling and planting? of his own prepar|ing for the Creature of his peculiar Delight, made in his Image and Likene&s;s? There was doubtle&s;s a <HI>Collection</HI> of every Thing <HI>plea&s;ant and fair for Delight,</HI> and all ranged in the mo&s;t beauteous <HI>Or|der.&mdash;Souls</HI> know no higher <HI>Compari&s;on</HI> whereby to expre&s;s their <HI>Delights</HI> in GOD their Maker, Sa|viour and Sanctifier; nor <HI>His</HI> in Them; in and with whom He &s;till <HI>walks</HI> as He did with <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> in <HI>Eden:</HI> Cant. iv12,&mdash;16.</P>
<P>The Scituation of the <HI>Earthly Paradi&s;e</HI> &s;eems to me a vain Enquiry. After <HI>Sin</HI> had bla&s;ted it, it might become one of the mo&s;t barren and wa&s;te Places, even before the <HI>Flood;</HI> as the Garden of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> became after their Iniquity and Puni&s;hment was full. The <HI>Flood</HI> tore the Surface of the Earth in pieces, and the Spot where Paradi&s;e was may be now a Lake of Water, or a craggy Rock. <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI>

If there had ever been ano|ther, it had been in the Gardens of <HI>Solomon,</HI> but <HI>Vanity and Folly and Death</HI> &s;oon convinc'd the <HI>Mo|narch</HI> that no Labour or Expence of Man can re|cover any <HI>Earthly Paradi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Paradi&s;e had been nothing, without <HI>Purity,</HI> Rectitude and <HI>Immortality</HI> in it. As &s;oon as <HI>Sin</HI> entered, and <HI>Death</HI> by Sin, Man found no more any Paradi&s;e in <HI>Eden,</HI> but fled, hid and was driven out of it. And &s;o 'tis as to all our Imaginary Paradi&s;es <HI>regain</HI>'d here, in a State of Sin and Death.

<P>The <HI>Air</HI> without, and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> within, was &s;uch in the <HI>Paradi&s;aic</HI> State, that our Parents needed no <HI>Covering. The Man and his Wife were naked, and were not a&s;hamed.</HI> This is admirably well &s;aid of a State of Innocence and moral Perfection. The Purity and Wi&s;dom of God dwelt in them, and they could have nothing to blu&s;h at. This was the <HI>better,</HI> the Superior Part of Paradi&s;e; far more than all its delicious Fruits to the Eye or Palate, or than the perfum'd &s;erene Air to their No&s;trils. Their Paradi&s;e was <HI>within Them&s;elves,</HI> and &s;o is every wi&s;e and good Man's in the Grace of God within him. The obedient <HI>Animals</HI> about them were nothing to their own <HI>Obedience</HI> to God; His <HI>Spirit</HI> in 'em and <HI>Image</HI> on them. This made their Heart glad, their Face to &s;hine, the Air calm, and the Fruits delicious. "By the Fall we have lo&s;t, as <HI>One</HI> well ob&s;erves, the true Notion of Honour and Shame". There is nothing &s;hameful but <HI>Sin,</HI>

<P>How ungrateful to God, and unnatural to Them|&s;elves, was <HI>this Sin</HI> of our fir&s;t Parents!

And now let us &s;ee <HI>by what Means</HI> he effected this his devili&s;h De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Only the Writings of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> let us into the <HI>Ori|ginal of Evil.</HI> That GOD is good, and that He mu&s;t needs make all things <HI>good,</HI> and Man &s;o in a &s;ingular manner, is agreed on all Hands. But <HI>whence</HI> then &s;hould <HI>Evil</HI> come? This is a <HI>Difficulty</HI> that has puzzled all Men, who have not &s;een or us'd the Key of <HI>Scripture.</HI> That only opens to us <HI>the Gates of the Shadow of Death,</HI> and &s;hows us the Goodne&s;s and Holine&s;s of God, without the lea&s;t Imputation from all the Mi&s;ery and Ruin, that Man by the In&s;tigation of the Devil has bro't upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Wonder is, how <HI>Sin</HI> could enter into any of the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, in their Superior State of Knowledge and Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s and Holine&s;s. And the <HI>Gue&s;&s;es</HI> of learned &amp; pious Men are very vain, I fear, in this Point, if they venture further than the SPIRIT OF GOD has led 'em, in the few <HI>Hints</HI> given of this tremendous Matter in the <HI>written Word.</HI> There we read of <HI>the Condemna|tion of the Devil,</HI> that it was for <HI>Pride:</HI> 1 Tim. iii. 6. The mo&s;t probable Account that can be of the <HI>Sin of Angels:</HI> that there was &s;ome <HI>Di&s;content, Emu|lation</HI>

<P>This was the <HI>Original</HI> of Sin and Mi&s;ery; pro|bably long before our Earth was created and Man upon it. And when <HI>Angels</HI> &s;aw the Delights of God <HI>in the Sons of Men</HI> and &s;houted for Joy, the <HI>Devils</HI> were filled with Madne&s;s and Vexation at it, and &s;et them&s;elves to de&s;troy this plea&s;ing Workman&s;hip of God.</P>
<P>We are greatly obliged to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in the Hand of GOD, for this Di&s;covery to us of the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> the Way and Means of our Ruin. We are deliver'd from the vain and <HI>ab&s;urd</HI> Imagination which others have gone into of an <HI>Evil God,</HI> as well as a <HI>Good</HI> One. A mo&s;t <HI>impious</HI> Principle, and plea&s;ing eno' to the <HI>Devil;</HI> to make a <HI>God</HI> of him, and give him a Throne like the <HI>Mo&s;t High.</HI> A very grateful Return to Him for all the Mi&s;chief he has done us!</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> went into this ridiculous Notion, which was the Rea&s;on of the Prophet's Words to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the Anointed while yet unborn, in the Name of the LORD: I&s;ai. xlv. 5, 6, 7. <HI>I am the</HI> LORD, <HI>and there is none el&s;e, there is none be&s;ide Me; I girded thee, tho' thou ha&s;t not known Me: That they may know from the Ri&s;ing of the Sun and from the We&s;t, that there is none be&s;ide Me: I am the</HI> LORD <HI>and there is none el&s;e: I form the Light and create Darkne&s;s, I make Peace &amp; create Evil; I the</HI> LORD <HI>do all the&s;e things.</HI> You may be ready to think, this would mi&s;lead the People of <HI>Cyrus</HI> into an ill Tho't of the <HI>Good God,</HI> as if he were the <HI>Author of Evil.</HI> But the plain Meaning is, that there can|not po&s;&s;ibly be <HI>two Gods,</HI> the one good and the o|ther evil; Oppo&s;ites and Rivals to each Other; and that &s;uch an Imagination ought never to have enter'd into their fooli&s;h blinded Hearts. For GOD is nece&s;&s;arily <HI>One only,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t Good;</HI> and
<PB N="36" REF="003887_0039_10020CD07585D010">at fir&s;t made all Things good, and forbad Evil to the uttermo&s;t. But intelligent Creatures &s;inn'd a|gain&s;t their own Light, abus'd their Freedom, and bro't the Evil upon Them&s;elves. And now <HI>this Evil</HI> is under the wi&s;e and righteous Government of the <HI>Good God,</HI> is the Puni&s;hment of a wicked World, and over ruled by God to the mo&s;t wi&s;e, good and holy Ends. Therefore there is but <HI>One Providence</HI> and Dominion over all, which is alto|gether good and perfect, and in the Hand of the <HI>GOD of I&s;rael,</HI> the one living and true God.</P>
<P>Into all this Train of Truth and Religion to the <HI>One Eternal &s;upream</HI> GOD, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> leads us by his Account of the <HI>Origine</HI> of Evil; telling us how God made Man very good and happy, and how &s;oon he made him&s;elf &s;inful and mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>But the Wonder then mu&s;t be about the <HI>Way</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> of Man's bringing him&s;elf under Sin and Mi&s;ery. And <HI>this</HI> is the <HI>Particular</HI> which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> (under the In&s;piration of God) has revealed to us. A Matter of the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Importance to the Honour of God, and for our Recovery to Him. And when we have con&s;idered <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his Account, we cannot conceive of any other, or like Way, for the <HI>Original</HI> of all the Evils, of Body and Soul, that we find our Selves under, from our Birth into the World, to our going out of it.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> therefore lets us know, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place; That God having made Man's <HI>Body</HI> to &s;ub&s;i&s;t and live <HI>by Food,</HI> growing out of the Earth; He im|mediately gave <HI>Direction</HI> to Man about his proper <HI>Food.</HI> Gen. i. 29. <HI>And God &s;aid, Behold, I have given you every Herb bearing Seed, which is upon the Face of all the Earth; and every Tree yielding Fruit; to you it &s;hall be for Meat. Mo&s;es</HI> goes on in the next <HI>Chapter</HI> and tells us, <Q>That the LORD GOD having planted the Garden in <HI>Eden</HI> for his Crea|ture
<PB N="37" REF="003887_0040_10020CD24438B040"><HI>Man,</HI> He fill'd it <HI>with every Tree plea&s;ant to the Eye and good for Food;</HI> and <HI>in the Mid&s;t of the Garden he plac'd the Tree of Life,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>a Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil:</HI> And that <HI>the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>commanded the Man, &s;aying, Of every Tree of the Garden thou maye&s;t freely eat, out of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil thou &s;halt not eat of it; for in the Day that thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now what could be more <HI>good</HI> than all this? con|&s;ulting the Honour of God and Man's Happine&s;s, in God's Government and Man's Obedience! and other Way for <HI>Either</HI> there could be none. What could <HI>the wi&s;e and holy</HI> ONE do more, or what le&s;s, to <HI>prevent</HI> the very Being and Knowledge of Evil? He forbid it on Pain of Death, he told our Parents the certain Con&s;equent of their Di&s;obedience to Him, in <HI>this</HI> or any other Particular; that it would be ALL EVIL to them, Death and Damnation to Body and Soul.</P>
<P>It was in the Power and Will of Man now to have obey'd and continued happy; but to be &s;ure you would have tho't that he could never dare to offend in this particular Point, by <HI>Eating of the forbidden Tree,</HI> which carried <HI>the Knowledge of Evil</HI> in its Name. But God &s;aw Man's Danger was here, in his <HI>Appetite,</HI> which it was fit to re&s;train and direct as to every thing that would be <HI>hurtful</HI> to the Life of the Body, and therein al&s;o to the Powers of the Soul; and what&s;oever was not &s;o, Man might be &s;ure his bountiful <HI>Maker</HI> would not prohibit to him.</P>
<P>It &s;eems very rea&s;onable to think, That Man in the Perfection of his Under&s;tanding needed the <HI>Direction</HI> of God, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tells us he had it, in re&s;pect of his proper <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">d.</HI> He was not created with a natural <HI>In&s;tinct</HI> like the brute Creatures, which is to them a more <HI>infallible</HI> Direction than

<P>I own, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary for us to &s;uppo&s;e this <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> in the forbidden Tree. It is eno' that God forbad it, were it never &s;o good in it &s;elf. <Q>It was certainly intended <HI>to prove our fir&s;t Pa|rents</HI> whether they would continue good, or lap&s;e into known Evil.</Q> They knew it would be <HI>good</HI> in them to ab&s;tain and obey, and would cer|tainly be very <HI>evil</HI> in them, and bring Evil on 'em to di&s;obey and eat. They could not think that God would have denied 'em this Tree, if it were not Evil for them in it &s;elf, for any other End but the <HI>Trial</HI> of their Obedience, whether they would continue good.&mdash; Yet on the other Hand, there might be (for ought we know) a <HI>natural Evil</HI> to the Body of Man in this forbidden Tree.

It comes to the &s;ame Thing, if with other <HI>Divines</HI> we judge the Tree of Life to have been only <Q>a <HI>Sign and Seal</HI> of the Conti|nuance of Life and Happine&s;s to <HI>Adam,</HI> even unto Immortality and everla&s;ting Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, thro' the Grace and Favour of his Maker, up|on Condition of his Per&s;everance in his State of Innocence and Obedience.</Q> In like manner the <HI>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil</HI> was at lea&s;t this, "A Sign and warning to <HI>Adam</HI> of the <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> of Life and Happine&s;s, and of the &s;ad <HI>Expe|riment</HI> of Evil in Soul and Body; and as &s;uch it was forbidden him. &mdash; So that here were <HI>Life and Death,</HI> Ble&s;&s;ing and Cur&s;ing, &s;et before our fir&s;t Parents, as in <HI>two Sacramental Signs &amp; Seals</HI> annex|ed to the Covenant of Works.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> lets us know that Man's <HI>Depra|vation</HI> both in Soul and Body was from his <HI>Sinning</HI> again&s;t God, and that the Sin of Man was his in|dulging an <Q><HI>irregular Appetite,</HI> in an In&s;tance po&s;itively forbidden him, with a mo&s;t plain Threatning of the mortal Effects of it<NOTE N="&verbar;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Revelation Examined,</HI> Di&s;&s;ert.

God had made him very <HI>knowing</HI> and happy in all Re&s;pects, and he ought to have been not only <HI>contented</HI> with, but very <HI>thankful</HI> for his Endowments and Enjoyments both intellectual and &s;en&s;itive. God had made him to u&s;e his Knowledge, and to govern his Ap|petites,
<PB N="40" REF="003887_0043_10020CD765857FD0">in a reverential Obedience to Him his LORD. To di&s;obey was nece&s;&s;arily to defile him|&s;elf both as to Soul and Body, and that <HI>pre&s;ump|tnou&s;ly</HI> in Defiance to the Warning given him of the fatal Effect on both, Death bodily and &s;piri|tual. Here was a Complication of Infidelity, In|gratitude, Di&s;content, Prophane&s;s, Sen&s;uality, Pride and Arrogance, with unnatural Cruelty a|gain&s;t his own Life, and that of his Offspring.</P>
<P>This Account of the <HI>Original</HI> of Sin and Mi&s;ery wonderfully agrees with the Progre&s;s and <HI>Propaga|tion</HI> of it from Age to Age. As one excellently ob&s;erves and argues, <Q>We &s;ee it &s;till in our Selves to be the E&s;tabli&s;hment of God, in the Nature and Con&s;titution of Things, that all irregular Indulgence of bodily Appetite, of one Kind or other, is atttended with Evil: And &s;o al&s;o every inordinate Affection and Pa&s;&s;ion of Soul, and in particular all vain Pur&s;uits of &s;uperiour Wi&s;dom, Affectation and Pride of Knowledge, naturally tend to impair the Powers of the Mind and make it vain. And as this is matter of Fact, &s;o what can be more worthy of the Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s and Perfection of God's Government, than that the Abu&s;e of Rea&s;on &s;hould impair the Powers of it, and Indulgence of Appetite make it more irregular.</Q> And if every Di&s;or|der of Mind and Fle&s;h in Man is &s;till attended with Evil, how agreable to Rea&s;on mu&s;t this Ac|count of <HI>the Original of Evil</HI> be, which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> gives us; &s;oil, That God acquainted <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> as &s;oon as he had made 'em, with <HI>this</HI> certain and invariable Con&s;titution of Humane Nature; and therefore vehemently prohibited every inordi|nate De&s;ire and Appetite, becau&s;e of the <HI>Evil</HI> that would on&s;ue upon it, to Them&s;elves fir&s;t and al&s;o to their Po&s;terity after them; which in the Cour&s;e

<P>And this again was a very great <HI>Aggravation</HI> of the fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that it mu&s;t be in the Cour&s;e of Nature the Inlet and <HI>Entail</HI> of Sin and Mi&s;ery upon the Offspring. If the fir&s;t Parents corrupted them&s;elves, their I&s;&s;ue mu&s;t come depraved into the World both in Soul and Body: <HI>For who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean? That which is born of the Fle&s;h is Fle&s;h.</HI> People that are vici|ous and lu&s;tful corrupt their own Seed, more or le&s;s by their Indulgences, and often entail Di&s;ea&s;es, Dolours and evil Inclinations upon their Offspring; which is one Way of God's <HI>vi&s;iting the Iniquity of Parents on their Children to the third and fourth Ge|neration.</HI> &mdash; And that the fir&s;t Corruption of Man|kind &s;hould be by their fir&s;t Parents eating of a Fruit forbidden to them, becau&s;e Evil for them to eat of, by a good God, can't &s;eem at all &s;trange to us who know that there are &s;everal &s;orts of Fruits growing at this Day about us, the eating whereof would poi&s;on our Bodies and be deadly to us, &s;ome pre&s;ently, &s;ome more lei&s;urely. And tho&s;e that do in the mo&s;t &s;low manner affect the bodily Life, do at the &s;ame Periods of Time and in the &s;ame Degrees affect the Soul and hurt the Powers of the Mind. The <HI>Experiment</HI> and Knowledge of Evil comes on Mankind after this Manner unto this Day. No wonder then if it fir&s;t came in at this Door. Nay it may be we &s;hould find, if we could but attain a <HI>perfect</HI> Knowledge of the Effects of e|very forbidden Indulgence of bodily Appetite, and the Pa&s;&s;ions of our Souls, that there is not the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> of either Kind we can be guilty of, but it does in &s;ome Degree impair the Health and Life of the Body, as well as the Virtue and Purity of the Soul. Our Soul and Body in their pre&s;ent

<P>Let the Wit of Man &s;how if it can a more <HI>eredible,</HI> a like <HI>natural</HI> Account of the <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Propagation</HI> of Sin and Mi&s;ery.

<P>For my own part, If I know what <HI>free thinking</HI> is in this our degenerate State, wherein we find the Powers of Mind and Body infeebled and depraved to a great Degree; If I know what it is to rea&s;on clearly and impartially, it is on the Side of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and by Faith given to what he has written as a Revelation from God unto us. But it is no great wonder to &s;ee the <HI>Men of Licence</HI> and vicious Life at Defiance to the Writings of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> which would convince them of Sin and lead 'em to the <HI>Original</HI> of it, and thereby condemn to Death all their lov'd criminal Indulgences both of Fle&s;h and Spirit. For if they own <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his Account to be true, <HI>Death</HI> mu&s;t be for ever &s;taring 'em in the Face in all the Exce&s;&s;es of their bodily Appetites, in all their in|ordinate Pa&s;&s;ions, and more e&s;pecially in their dar|ling imperious <HI>A&s;&s;uming of Knowledge</HI> to them|&s;elves,
<PB N="43" REF="003887_0046_10020C7DE65EE428">as if none had ta&s;ted of that <HI>Tree</HI> be&s;ide 'em, but they were <HI>the Gods knowing Good &amp; Evil.</HI></P>
<P>And it is too true that this is their Guilt and A&s;piration, in Similitude of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, while they ridicule the Imputation of it and the Derivation of it. So has the <HI>Serpent beguiled 'em thro' his Subtlety,</HI> and like their fir&s;t Parents they tran&s;gre&s;s daily, but do not <HI>&s;ee them&s;elves naked.</HI> While they laugh at the Account of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, and banter <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> for it, they are but <HI>feeding on the Tree of Death without Fear.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay again, The <HI>Origine</HI> of Evil had remain'd <HI>unknown</HI> to us to this Day, if God had not <HI>reveal'd</HI> it to us in his Word. <HI>The World by Wi&s;dom</HI> could not know it. Neither the <HI>Grecian</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Schools could imagine which way Mankind had become &s;o vicious, fooli&s;h and mi&s;erable. The mo&s;t pro|bable Solution of the Matter was the Opinion of a <HI>pre-exi&s;tent State</HI> wherein Souls had &s;inned, and were &s;ent into the&s;e Bodies as into <HI>Pri&s;ons</HI> in Way of Puni&s;hment. Others went into the before na|med ridiculous Notion of <HI>two oppo&s;ite and contrary Principles or Cau&s;es,</HI> the One of all the <HI>Good</HI> in the World, the other of all the <HI>Evil</HI> in it. What Confu&s;ion was there in this Imagination of an <HI>Evil God?</HI> how <HI>were their fooli&s;h Hearts darkned?</HI> What a Mercy is it to be delivered out of this Maze and Labyrinth of Evil! Truth is ea&s;ie, but Error is endle&s;s. How <HI>plain</HI> is the Matter now <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> has told it to us? in the <HI>Que&s;t</HI> whereof we &s;hould have wandered in vain without his <HI>Clue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Evil</HI> is from the Creature and not from God. Far be it from the ALMIGHTY <HI>who cannot be tempted with Evil, neither tempteth he any Man.</HI> Angels and Men were <HI>drawn away of their own Lu&s;t and enticed.</HI> God inclined both the One and Other &s;trongly to Good, commanded it, and forbad the
<PB N="44" REF="003887_0047_10020CDB67857268">Knowledge of Evil. <HI>Angels</HI> were high in the Creation of God, but a&s;piring to be higher they fell by <HI>Pride.</HI> Fallen they &s;well'd with Rage and Envy and Hatred of God, and of every happy Being, the Objects of his Love and Favour. <HI>Man</HI> being of this ble&s;&s;ed Number, the Prince of Devils had him in his &s;piteful Eye, and pre&s;ently devi&s;ed Means how to &s;poil <HI>God</HI> of his Glory from Man, and <HI>Man</HI> of his Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in the Favour of God. He knew there was but <HI>one Way</HI> in which to com|pa&s;s this dire Event, and that was to entice Man into <HI>Sin, the abominable Thing which God hates.</HI> To compa&s;s this he con&s;idered the Nature of Man both as to Soul and Body, the Appetite of the one to <HI>Food,</HI> and the Thir&s;t of the other after <HI>Knowledge:</HI> And there being in the Garden one Tree of good|ly Fruit to look on forbidden to the Man, he pro|po&s;ed if he could by any Means to bring him to <HI>lu&s;t</HI> after it and eat of it, and he fix'd on that by which he and his Angels had fallen; &s;cil, <HI>Di&s;con|tent</HI> in his State, and by a&s;piring after more <HI>Know|ledge;</HI> a Temptation to <HI>which</HI> he would draw from the very <HI>Name</HI> of the forbidden Tree, <HI>the Tree of Knowledge;</HI> a Tree (he would feign) to be de&s;ir|ed for an <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> of Knowledge and Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Way,</HI> as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tells us, Man was &s;educed, thro' the Subtlety of <HI>Satan,</HI> the <HI>Prince of Devils,</HI> to di&s;obey God, and bring Ruine on Him&s;elf and on his Po&s;terity, both as to Soul and Body. And what can be more probable than <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Way and Inlet to all the <HI>Evil</HI> we find our Selves &s;ubject to here in this Life, and to <HI>Death</HI> the End of it? What but <HI>Di&s;obedience</HI> to God our Maker, and <HI>Re|bellion</HI> again&s;t his <HI>Will</HI> made known to us for our Good? even for our Pre&s;ervation in Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s. What can be more honorary and <HI>glo|rious to God</HI> than this Account of the Original of Evil? and what more <HI>like our Selves,</HI> our own
<PB N="45" REF="003887_0048_10020CDDA0482130">Con&s;ciences being Witne&s;&s;es? For to be &s;ure we find our Selves fallen into Sin, and mo&s;t prone to it by Nature from our Birth; and what more like|ly Account can there be of our coming into &s;uch a State, than by the In&s;tigation of &s;ome <HI>Devil</HI> or other, in &s;uch an In&s;tance as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> has related? Nor can we wonder at the <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> of &s;o much Evil, bodily and &s;piritual; upon the Suppo&s;ition of &s;uch <HI>Sin</HI> and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let us therefore &s;eriou&s;ly peru&s;e and weigh the whole <HI>Proce&s;s</HI> of the Temptation and Seduction of our fir&s;t Parents, as it is given by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and &s;ee if it be not the mo&s;t likely, and only probable Account of the <HI>Origine</HI> of Evil that has been offered.</P>
<P>That <HI>Evil</HI> could not come from the <HI>Good</HI> GOD, as His Act, Will or Plea&s;ure, is mo&s;t certain: The Nature of God mu&s;t abhor from it, and &s;o does <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his Account.&mdash; That <HI>Evil</HI> is of two Sorts is evident, <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>penal;</HI> the Evil of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Pu|ni&s;hment</HI> for Sin: <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> reveals it, and we are con&s;cious to it within our Selves; we have <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> of Sorrow and Pain, and we have the <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> of Sin.&mdash; That bodily and Soul <HI>Sorrows</HI> or Suffer|ings, and that Di&s;&s;olution of Soul and Body which they work, &s;hould be the <HI>Fruit</HI> of our Sinning a|gain&s;t God, is the mo&s;t ea&s;y, natural and only rea|&s;onable and worthy Account of the Matter, that the Wit of Man can give.&mdash; That <HI>Evils</HI> be&s;et us from the Womb, and pur&s;ue us thro' all our Life here in the Fle&s;h, wear out our Bodies and Spirits, and bring down our green or gray Heads to the Grave, is a thing not to be denied. &mdash; That <HI>the&s;e</HI> are under the Providence and <HI>Government</HI> of a mo&s;t wi&s;e, good and holy GOD, is as certain as the very Being of One.&mdash;That they mu&s;t come upon us for Correction and Judgment, and in a Way of <HI>Pu|ni&s;hment,</HI>

<ITEM>1. There was a <HI>Tree of Evil</HI> in the Garden where <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were plac'd by God.</ITEM>

<ITEM>4. We may as rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Devil</HI> in the Serpent's Form, like <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> a fal&s;e and <HI>lying Spirit,</HI> told her that he came by his <HI>Know|ledge</HI> and Under&s;tanding, and by the Power of <HI>Speech,</HI> by hapning to <HI>eat</HI> of the excellent Fruit of <HI>that Tree:</HI> That whereas till now he had been indeed a <HI>brute</HI> Creature and de&s;titute of Know|ledge, immediately his Eyes were open, and a <HI>Man's</HI> Heart was given him, and this Light and Under&s;tanding came into him, which &s;he now &s;aw and heard.</ITEM>

<ITEM>6.

<ITEM>7.

<ITEM>8. <HI>Eve</HI> naturally, and truly replied, Yes, <HI>We may eat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden, but of this Tree God hath &s;aid, "Ye &s;hall not eat of it; neither &s;hall ye touch it, le&s;t ye die.</HI></ITEM>

<P>It is plain there had been &s;ome <HI>previous Confe|rence</HI> between the <HI>Serpent</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> before the Ser|pent's Words, <HI>"Yea, hath God &s;aid, ye &s;hall not eat?</HI> It &s;eems to be a Return to &s;omewhat &s;aid
<PB N="51" REF="003887_0054_10020CE41AD55E98">before. The Temptation had been el&s;e too <HI>abrupt,</HI> and the Devil had betray'd him&s;elf to be endued with <HI>more</HI> than humane Knowledge; even to know what God had &s;aid to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> while he was yet a <HI>Brute</HI> and without Under&s;tanding.&mdash; Or if you would chu&s;e to think, that the Serpent would have <HI>Eve</HI> imagine, that he had indeed attain'd to the Intelligence of <HI>Angels</HI> by eating of the forbid|den Fruit, it will but carry the Deception yet <HI>higher,</HI> and make the Temptation &s;o much the &s;tronger.&mdash;But it is more likely that he appear'd to take this Information from her own <HI>Lips,</HI> and leads her into Wonder and <HI>Inqui&s;itivene&s;s</HI> after the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of &s;uch a Prohibition to them; while &s;he &s;aw (as was pretended) the happy wondrous <HI>Effect</HI> that the Fruit had on him, the <HI>Serpent,</HI> that was before an ignorant and <HI>dumb</HI> Bea&s;t.&mdash;And when the <HI>Devil</HI> had by this <HI>Wile</HI> &s;hook her Mind, rais'd in her a <HI>Su&s;pen&s;e</HI> and doubtful Admiration, and too much a Regard to her Sen&s;es, in a Contradiction to the Word of God; then the <HI>Tempter</HI> boldly &s;hot his <HI>fiery Dart,</HI> and as a Creature of &s;uperior Light &s;aid to the <HI>Woman, "Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die: For God doth know that in the Day you eat your Eyes &s;hall be opened, and ye &s;hall be as God's, knowing Good and Evil.</HI></P>
<P>This bold <HI>Satanical</HI> Rea&s;oning had its cur&s;ed Effect upon the Mind and Heart of <HI>Eve!</HI> She took in the Poi&s;on of <HI>Pride,</HI> and the <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> after more Knowledge conceived within her, and &s;he <HI>fell</HI> after the Example of <HI>Satan.</HI> She look'd upon the Fruit with De&s;ire, believing all that the <HI>Serpent</HI> had &s;aid of it. It <HI>look'd</HI> good for food; nay the Serpent had <HI>found</HI> it &s;o: It was plea&s;ant to her <HI>Eye,</HI> but more to her a&s;piring <HI>Mind:</HI> She con&s;i|dered it as de&s;irable to make her <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> wi&s;e as the <HI>Angels</HI> of God who know <HI>good and evil:</HI> She gree|dily took therefore of the Fruit and eat, <HI>and gave
<PB N="52" REF="003887_0055_10020C88E6A5C0C8">al&s;o to her Husband with her, and he did eat.</HI> That is to &s;ay, She went away to <HI>Adam,</HI> with &s;ome of the Fruit in her Hand, and told him of all that &s;he had <HI>&s;een</HI> and <HI>heard</HI> of the Serpent's <HI>eating</HI> and <HI>&s;peaking,</HI> with Under&s;tanding equal if not &s;uperior to their own; and that he had told her to what <HI>Angelical and Godlike Heights of Knowledge</HI> the Fruit will rai&s;e <HI>them</HI> upon their eating of it: To all which <HI>Adam</HI> hearkened, and from a <HI>like Lu&s;t after for|bidden Knowledge,</HI> he &s;uddenly, ra&s;hly and fatally took from his Wifes Hand and eat.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me, that our Fir&s;t Parents not tak|ing Time to <HI>deliberate</HI> on the Matter, did not &s;ee into the real <HI>Devili&s;m</HI> of the Serpent's Words; that it was a giving God the <HI>Lye,</HI> &verbar;and to <HI>tax</HI> him with want of Goodne&s;s and Bounty to his Creatures, or with grudging to 'em and denying them the Know|ledge that was proper for 'em. Or if we may think that the &s;agacious Minds of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> could not fail of the&s;e Reflections upon the Devil's Words, then was their <HI>Crime</HI> and Guilt &s;o much the more like unto the very <HI>Devils</HI> who deceived them.</P>
<P>And now I may appeal unto the Heart of every impartial <HI>Reader,</HI> if <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> has not given us the mo&s;t <HI>likely</HI> Account we can imagine, of the <HI>Seduction</HI> and Fall of our fir&s;t Parents? <HI>How the Serpent be|guiled Eve thro' his Subtlety! how by one Man Sin has enter'd into the World, and Death by Sin, and has pa&s;&s;ed upon all! how by one Man's Di&s;obedience all are made Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>I go on now to the <HI>Con&s;equents</HI> upon the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> as they are related by <HI>Mo&s;es:</HI> And for my own part I cannot but think the <HI>Account</HI> given by him to be &s;o <HI>rational</HI> and natural, that I cannot imagine how it <HI>could</HI> be otherwi&s;e. That is to &s;ay,</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="003887_0056_10020CE6FA446D78">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That as &s;oon as our <HI>Fir&s;t Parents</HI> had &s;inned <HI>they &s;aw them&s;elves naked:</HI> i. e. found them&s;elves under &s;ome &s;hameful <HI>Di&s;order</HI> both of Mind and Body: A Cloud came upon their Minds, Guilt &s;tung 'em, Fear &s;eiz'd 'em, and they &s;aw each other's Face chang'd for the wor&s;e: The Joys of Inno|cence left their Eyes, the Poi&s;on of the Fruit work'd in their Veins, &s;ick Qualms and cold Sweats came upon them, and their Minds were full of Confu&s;ion and Con&s;ternation at their Di&s;appoint|ment: They felt the forbidden <HI>Knowledge of Evil,</HI> and were ready to run and hide them&s;elves any where.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to think that <HI>God would now appear, arraign and condemn them to die,</HI> according to his <HI>Threatning</HI> in Ca&s;e they di&s;obey'd Him.

Our <HI>Parents</HI> al&s;o heard it, and were enlightned to conceive of <HI>&s;ome mo&s;t glorious Deli|verer, a Son of Eve,</HI> in God's Time; and it was <HI>Life from the Dead</HI> to them; while it was <HI>Death and Damnation</HI> in the wor&s;t <HI>Form</HI> that could be to the <HI>proud Serpent,</HI> to be overcome, de&s;troyed, judged and damned by a <HI>mortal Son</HI> of that <HI>weak Woman,</HI> whom he had ju&s;t deceiv'd into Sin and Ruin.&mdash; Say now, if this was not worthy of the Infinite Wi&s;dom and <HI>Foreknowledge</HI> of God, his Sovereignty and Dominion, his Ju&s;tice Mercy and Grace! <HI>This is the</HI> LORD'S <HI>Doing and wonderful in our Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Then GOD, the <HI>Judge,</HI> proceeded and told the <HI>Woman,</HI> that he would <HI>multiply her Sorrows</HI> in bear|ing Children, for alluring her <HI>Husband</HI> into Sin; and that henceforth <HI>She</HI> and her <HI>Daughters</HI> &s;hould be in &s;uch a &s;uffering &s;ort of <HI>Subjection</HI> to the <HI>Mens</HI> di&s;ordered Pa&s;&s;ions, as they would never at all have known, if She had not been an <HI>In&s;tru|ment</HI> in his Sin and Fall. &mdash; The <HI>Man</HI> al&s;o was told that <HI>the Ground was cur&s;ed for his &s;ake,</HI> that <HI>in Sorrow he &s;hould eat of it all the Days of his Life, till he return'd into it:</HI> Which Words were a plain and expre&s;s <HI>Reprieve</HI> granted to <HI>Adam and Eve</HI> from de&s;erved <HI>in&s;tant</HI> Death; but as plain and po&s;itive a Declaration of <HI>Death working in them,</HI> from that Day forward, and bringing them down
<PB N="56" REF="003887_0059_10020C8F6D0FF320"><HI>&s;lowly</HI> to the Grave. &mdash; All Mankind have been from that Day a <HI>Comment</HI> on this righteous and terrible Judgment of God; having the full <HI>Expe|riment</HI> of it in Them&s;elves. All &s;adly know the <HI>Truth</HI> of it. It has been, is and will be to the End of the World, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> has written. <HI>Adam</HI>'s <HI>Sin</HI> is the Original, Cau&s;e and Means, of all the dolorous <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> of Body and <HI>Griefs</HI> of Mind, which bring on that Death, to which every Son and Daughter of <HI>Adam</HI> are inevitably doom'd by the righteous <HI>Sentence</HI> of God.</P>

It agrees to all the pre&s;ent known State of Man|kind, our dying Condition, the Sorrows of our Life, our Prone&s;s and Temptations to Sin, our Lu&s;ts and Corruptions, and our fearful Apprehen|&s;ions of the Eternal Judgment of God, a <HI>Hell of Devils.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things might be ea&s;ily <HI>enlarg'd</HI> on, but the bare &s;imple Mention of them carries, I think, a Light and Conviction to every &s;ober con&s;ider|ing Mind.

A better <HI>Foundation for Chri&s;tianity</HI> could not have been contrived by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> had he liv'd and wrote after the Manife&s;tation of CHRIST in the Fle&s;h, and after his <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> from the Dead.</P>
<P>But alas! the <HI>Sons of Eve</HI> are born with the Seed and Poi&s;on of <HI>Infidelity</HI> in their Veins! that
