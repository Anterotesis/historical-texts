<HEAD>Entertaining Pa&s;&s;ages Relating to <HI>Philip's</HI> WAR which began in the Year, 1675. With the Proceedings of Benj. Church <ABBR>E&s;qr</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1674. Mr. <HI>Benjamin Church</HI> of <HI>Duxbury</HI> being providen|tially at <HI>Plymouth</HI> in the time of the Court, fell into acquaintance with Capt. <HI>John Almy</HI> of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land.</HI> Capt. <HI>Almy</HI> with great impor|tunity invited him to ride with him, and view that part of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony that lay next to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> known then by their Indian Names of <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> &amp; <HI>Segkonate.</HI> Among other arguments to per&s;wade him, he told him, the Soil was very rich, and the Situation plea&s;ant. Per&s;wades him by all means, to purcha&s;e of the Company &s;ome of the Court grant rights. He accepted his invitation, views the Country, &amp; was plea&s;ed with it; makes a purcha&s;e, &s;ettled a Farm, found the Gentlemen of the I&s;land very Civil &amp; obliging. And being him&s;elf a Per&s;on of uncommon Activi|ty and Indu&s;try, he &s;oon erected two buildings upon his Farm, and gain'd a good acquaintance with the Natives: got much into their favour, and was in a little time in great e&s;teem among them.</P>
<P>The next Spring advancing, while Mr. <HI>Church</HI> was diligently Settling his new Farm, &s;tocking, lea&s;ing &amp; di&s;po&s;ing of his Affairs, and had a fine pro&s;|pect of doing no &s;mall things; and hoping that his good &s;ucce&s;s would be inviting unto other good Men to become his Neighbours; Behold! the rumour of a War between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the Natives gave check to his projects. People began to be very jealous of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and indeed they had no &s;mall rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that they had form'd a de&s;ign of War upon the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had it daily &s;ugge&s;ted to him that the Indians were plotting a bloody de&s;ign. That <HI>Philip</HI> the great <HI>Mount-hope</HI> Sachem was Leader therein: and &s;o it prov'd, he was &s;ending his Me&s;&s;engers to all
<PB N="2" REF="001800_0005_0FB82C0CA045EAC8">the Neighbouring Sachem:, to ingage them in a Confederacy with him in the War.</P>
<P>Among the reft he &s;ent Six Men to <HI>Awa&s;honks</HI> Squaw-Sachem of the <HI>Seg|konate</HI> Indians, to engage her in his Intere&s;ts: <HI>Awa&s;honks</HI> &s;o far li&s;tened unto them as to call her Subjects together, to make a great Dance, which is the cu&s;tom of that Nation when they advi&s;e about Momentous Affairs. But what does <HI>Awa&s;honks</HI> do, but &s;ends away two of her Men that well under|&s;tood the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language (<HI>Sa&s;&s;amon</HI> and <HI>George</HI> by Name) to invite Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to the Dance. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> upon the Invitation, immediately takes with him <HI>Charles Hazelton</HI> his Tennants Son, who well under&s;tood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Language, and rid down to the Place appointed: Where they found hun|dreds of <HI>Indians</HI> gathered together from all Parts of her Dominion. <HI>Awa|&s;honks</HI> her &s;elf in a foaming Sweat was leading the Dance. But &s;he was no &s;ooner &s;en&s;ible of Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> arrival, but &s;he broke off, &s;at down, calls her Nobles round her, orders Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to be invited into her pre&s;ence. Complements being pa&s;t, and each one taking Seats. She told him, King <HI>Philip</HI> had &s;ent Six Men of his with two of her People that had been over at <HI>Mount-hope,</HI> to draw her into a confederacy with him in a War with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> De&s;iring him to give her his advice in the ca&s;e, and to tell her the Truth whether the <HI>Umpame</HI> Men (as <HI>Philip</HI> had told her) were gather|ing a great Army to invade <HI>Philips</HI> Country. He a&s;&s;ured her he would tell her the Truth, and give her his be&s;t advice. Then he told her twas but a few days &s;ince he came from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were then making no Preparations for War; That he was in Company with the Principal Gen|tlemen of the Government, who had no Di&s;cour&s;e at all about War; and he believ'd no tho'ts about it. He ask'd her whether &s;he tho't he would have brought up his Goods to Settle in that Place, if he apprehended an entering into War with &s;o near a Neighbour. She &s;eem'd to be &s;ome what convin'd by his talk, and &s;aid &s;he believ'd he &s;poke the Truth.</P>
<P>Then &s;he called for the <HI>Mount-hope</HI> Men: Who made a formidable ap|pearance, with their Faces Painted, and their Hair Trim'd up in Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|fa&s;hion, with their Powder-horns, and Shot-bags at their backs; which a|mong that Nation is the po&s;ture and figure of preparedne&s;s for War. She told Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> the&s;e were the Per&s;ons that had brought her the Report of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> preparation for War: And then told them what Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had &s;aid in an&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>Upon this began a warm talk among the Indians, but 'twas &s;oon qua&s;h'd, and <HI>Awa&s;honks</HI> proceeded to tell Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> that <HI>Philips</HI> Me&s;&s;age to her was, that unle&s;s &s;he would forth-with enter into a confederacy with him in a War again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> he would &s;end his Men over primely, to kill the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cattel, and burn their Hou&s;es on that &s;ide the River, which would provoke the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to fall upon her, whom they would without doubt &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="001800_0006_0FB82C1083BE2910">the author of the Mi&s;chief. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> told her he was &s;orry to &s;ee &s;o threatning an a&s;pect of Affairs; and &s;teping to the <HI>Mount-hopes,</HI> he felt of their bags, and finding them filled with Bullets, ask'd them what tho&s;e Bullets were for: They &s;coffingly reply'd to &s;hoot <HI>Pigeons</HI> with.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Church</HI> turn'd to <HI>Awa&s;honks,</HI> and told her if <HI>Philip</HI> were re&s;olv'd to make War, her be&s;t way would be to knock tho&s;e Six <HI>Mount-hopes</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> head, and &s;helter her &s;elf under the Protection of the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> upon which the <HI>Mount-bopes</HI> were for the pre&s;ent Dumb. But tho&s;e two of <HI>Awa&s;honks</HI> Men who had been at <HI>Mount-hope</HI> expre&s;s'd them&s;elves in a furious manner again&s;t his advice. And <HI>Little Eyes</HI> one of the Queens Council joyn'd with them, and urged Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to go a&s;ide with him among the bu&s;hes that he might have &s;ome private Di&s;cour&s;e with him, which other Indians imme|diately forbid being &s;en&s;ible of his ill de&s;ign: but the Indians began to &s;ide and grow very warm. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> with undaunted Courage told the <HI>Mount-hopes</HI> they were bloody wretches, and thir&s;ted after the blood of their <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Neighbours, who had never injur'd them, but had always abounded in their kindne&s;s to them. That for his own part, tho' he de&s;ired nothing more than Peace, yet if nothing but Was would &s;atisfie them, he believed he &s;hould prove a &s;harp thorne in their &s;ides; Bid the Company ob&s;erve tho&s;e Men that were of &s;uch bloody di&s;po&s;itions, whether Providence would &s;uffer them to Live to &s;ee the event of the War, which others more Peace|ably di&s;po&s;ed might do.</P>
<P>Then he told <HI>Awa&s;honks</HI> he thought it might be mo&s;t advi&s;able for her to &s;end to the Governour of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and &s;helter her &s;elf, and People under his Protection. She lik'd his advice, and de&s;ired him to go on her behalf to the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Government, which he con&s;ented to: And at parting ad|vi&s;ed her what ever &s;he did, not to de&s;ert the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, to joyn with her Neighbours in a Rebellion which would certainly prove fatal to her. [He mov'd none of his Goods from his Hou&s;e that there might not be the lea&s;t umbrage from &s;uch an Action.] She thank'd him for his advice, and &s;ent two of her Men to guard him to his Hou&s;e; which when they came here, urged him to take care to &s;ecure his Goods, which he refu&s;ed for the rea&s;ons before mentioned. But de&s;ired the <HI>Indians,</HI> that if what they feared, &s;hould happen, they would take care of what he left, and directed them to a Place in the woods where they &s;hould di&s;po&s;e them; which they faith-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>He took his leave of his guard, and bid them tell their Mi&s;tre&s;s, if &s;he continued &s;teady in her dependence on the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and kept within her own limits of <HI>Sogkonats,</HI> he would &s;ee her again quickly; and then ha&s;tned away to <HI>Poca&s;&s;et,</HI> where he met with <HI>Peter Nunnui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> the Husband of the Queen of <HI>Poca&s;&s;et,</HI> who was ju&s;t then come over in a Canoo from <HI>Mount-hope.</HI> Peter told him that there would certainly be War; for <HI>Philip</HI> had held a
<PB N="4" REF="001800_0007_0FB82C156F200E70">Dance of &s;everal Weeks continuance, and had entertain'd the Young Men from all Parts of the Country: And added the <HI>Philip</HI> expected to be &s;ent for to <HI>Plymouth</HI> to be examined about <HI>Sa&s;amon's</HI> death, who was Murder'd at <HI>A&s;&s;awom&s;et</HI>-Ponds; knowing him&s;elf guilty of contriving that Murder. The &s;ame <HI>Peter</HI> told him that he &s;aw Mr. <HI>James Brown</HI> of <HI>Swanzey,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Gorton</HI> who was an Interpreter, and two other Men who brought a Letter from the Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> to <HI>Philip.</HI> He ob&s;erv'd to him fur|ther, that the Young Men were very eager to begin the War, and would fain have kill'd Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> but <HI>Philip</HI> prevented it; telling them that his Father had charged him to &s;hew kindne&s;s to Mr. <HI>Brown.</HI> In &s;hort, <HI>Philip</HI> was forc'd to promi&s;e them that on the next Lords-Day when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were gone to Meeting they &s;hould rifle their Hou&s;es and from that time for|ward kill their Cattel.</P>
<P><HI>Peter</HI> de&s;ir'd Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to go and &s;ee his Wife, who was but up the! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill; he went and found but few of her People with her. She &s;aid they were all gone, again&s;t her Will to the Dances; and &s;he much fear'd there would be a War. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> advis'd her to go to the I&s;land and &s;ecure her &s;elf, and tho&s;e that were with her; and &s;end to the Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> who &s;he knew was her friend; and &s;o left her, re&s;olving to ha&s;ten to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and wait on the Governour: and he was &s;o expeditious that he was with the Governour early next Morning, tho' he waited on &s;ome of the Ma|gi&s;trates by the way, who were of the Council of War, and al&s;o met him at the Governours. He gave them an account of his ob&s;ervations and di&s;|coveries, which confirmed their former intelligences, and ha&s;tned their pre|paration for Defence.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> according to his promi&s;e to his People, permitted them to March out of the Neck on the next Lords-Day, when they plundred the neare&s;t Hou&s;es that the Inhabitants had de&s;erted: but as yet offer'd no violence to the People, at le&s;t none were killed. However the alarm was given by their Numbers, and ho&s;tile Equipage, and by the Prey they made of what they could find in the for&s;aken Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>An expre&s;s came the &s;ame day to the Governour, who immediately gave orders to the Captains of the Towns to March the greate&s;t Part of their Companies, and to rand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous at <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">,</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> Night, where Major <HI>Bradford</HI> was to receive them, and di&s;po&s;e them under Capt (now made Major) <HI>Cutwo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th</HI> of <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te.</HI> The Governour de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to give them his Company, and to u&s;e his intere&s;t in their behalf with the Gentle|men of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> He comply'd with it, and they March'd the next day. Major <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Church</HI> with a commanded party con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Friend-Indians.</HI> to March in the Front at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Main body. Their orders were to keep &s;o far before, as not be in &s;ight of the Army. And &s;o they did, for by the way, they killed a Deer,
<PB N="5" REF="001800_0008_0FB82C17EBEC2018">flead, roa&s;ted, and eat the mo&s;t of him before the Army came up, with them. But the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Forces &s;oon arriv'd at <HI>Swanzey,</HI> and were po&s;ted at Major <HI>Browns</HI> and Mr. <HI>Miles</HI>'s Garri&s;ons chiefly; and were there &s;oon joyned with tho&s;e that came from <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> who had entred into a Confederacy with their <HI>Plymouth</HI> Brethren, again&s;t the Perfidious Heathen.</P>
<P>The Enemy who began their Ho&s;tilities with plundring and de&s;troying Cattel, did not long content them&s;elves with that game. They thir&s;ted for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> blood, and they &s;oon broach'd it; killing two Men in the way not far from Mr. <HI>Miles</HI>'s Garri&s;on. And &s;oon after, eight more at <HI>Matta|pi&s;et:</HI> Upon who&s;e bodies they exerci&s;ed more than bruti&s;h barbarities; beheading, di&s;-membring and mangling them, and expo&s;ing them in the mo&s;t inhumane manner, which ga&s;h'd and gho&s;tly objects &s;truck a damp on all beholders.</P>
<P>The Enemy flu&s;h'd with the&s;e exploits, grew yet bolder, and skulking every where in the bu&s;nes, &s;hot at all Pa&s;&s;engers, and kill'd many that ventured abroad. They came &s;o near as to &s;hoot down two Sentinels at Mr. <HI>Miles</HI>'s Garri&s;on, under the very No&s;es of mo&s;t of our Forces. The&s;e provocations drew out the re&s;entments of &s;ome of Capt. <HI>Prentices</HI> Troop, who de&s;ired they might have liberty to go out and &s;eek the Enemy in their own quarters. Quarter Ma&s;ters <HI>Gill &amp; B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lcher</HI> commanded the Parties drawn cut, who earne&s;tly de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> company: They provided him a Hor&s;e and Furniture (his own being out of the way) he readily comply'd with their de&s;ires, and was &s;oon Mounted.</P>
<P>This party were no &s;ooner over <HI>Miles</HI>'s Bridge but were fired on by an Ambu&s;cado of about a dozen <HI>Indians,</HI> as they were afterwards di&s;covered to be. When they drew off the Pilot was Mortally wounded, Mr. <HI>Belcher</HI> re|ceived a &s;hot in his knee, and his Hor&s;e was kill'd under him, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was &s;truck with a Musket-ball on the &s;ide of his belly; but being clad with a buff Coat and &s;ome thickne&s;s of Paper under it, it never broke his skin. The Troopers were &s;urprized to &s;ee both their Commanders wounded, and wheel'd off. But Mr. <HI>Church</HI> per&s;waded, at length &s;torm'd and &s;tampt, and told them 'twas a &s;hame to run, and leave a wounded Man there to be|come a Prey to the barbarous Enemy. For the Pilot yet &s;at his Hor&s;e, tho' &s;o maz'd with the Shot, as not to have &s;en&s;e to guide him. Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> &s;econd|ed him, and offer'd, tho' much di&s;enabled, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing him of. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> asked a Stranger who gave them his company in that action, if he would go with him and fetch off the wounded Man: He readily con|&s;ented, they with Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> went, but the wounded Man fainted and fell off his Hor&s;e before they came to him; but Mr. <HI>Church</HI> and the Stranger di&s;|mounted, took up the Man dead, and laid him before Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> on his Hor&s;e. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> told the other two, if they would take care of the dead Man, he would go and fetch his Hor&s;e back, which was going off the Ca&s;&s;ey toward

He brought back the Hor&s;e, and call'd earne&s;tly and repeatedly to the Army to come over &amp; &s;ight the Enemy; and while he Good calling &amp; per&s;wading, the skulking Enemy return'd to their old &s;tand, and all di&s;charged their Guns as him at one clap, tho' every &s;hot mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d <HI>him;</HI> yet one of the Army on the other &s;ide of the river received one of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lls in his foot.

<P>Upon this 'twas immediately re&s;olv'd, and orders were given to March down into the Neck, and having pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge, and Ca&s;&s;ey, the directi|on was to extend both wings, which being not well headed, by tho&s;e that remain'd in the Center, &s;ome of them mi&s;took their Friends for their Ene|mies, and made a fire upon them on the right wing, and wounded that noble Heroick Youth En&s;ign <HI>Savage</HI> in the thigh; but it happily prov'd but a fle&s;h wound. They Marched until they came to the narrow of the Neck, at a Place called <HI>Koekkamuit,</HI> where they took down the heads of Eight <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Men that were kill'd at the head of <HI>Metapoi&s;et</HI>-Neck, and for upon Polls, after the barbarous manner of tho&s;e &s;alvages. There <HI>Philip</HI> had &s;taved all his Drums, and conveyed all his Canoo's to the Ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Metapoi&s;et</HI>-Ri|ver. Hence it was concluded by tho&s;e that were acquainted with the Mo|tions of tho&s;e People, that they had qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted the Neck. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em that <HI>Philip</HI> was doubtle&s;s gone ever to <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> &s;ide, to ingage tho&s;e Indians in Rebellion with him: which they &s;oon found to be true. The Enemy were not really beaten out of <HI>Mount hope</HI> Neck, tho' 'twas true they fled from thence; yet it was before any pur&s;u'd them. 'Twas but to &s;trengthen them&s;elves, and to gain a more advantagious Po&s;t. However, &s;ome and not a few plea&s;ed them&s;elves with the fancy of a Mighty Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>A grand Council was held, and a Re&s;olve pa&s;t, to build a Fort there to maintain the fir&s;t ground they had gain'd, by the Indians leaving it to them. And to &s;peak the Truth, it mu&s;t be &s;aid, That as they gain'd not that Field, by their Sword, nor their Bow; &s;o 'twas rather their fear than their courage, that oblig'd them to &s;et up the marks of their Conque&s;t Mr. <HI>Church</HI> look'd upon it, and talk of it with contempt, and urged hard the pur&s;uing the Enemy on <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> &s;ide, and with the greater earne&s;tne&s;s, becau&s;e of his promi&s;e made to <HI>Awa&s;honks,</HI> before mentioned. The Council adjourned them&s;elves from <HI>Mount-hope</HI> to <HI>Reboboth,</HI> where Mr. Trea&s;urer <HI>Southworth</HI> be|ing weary of his charge of Commi&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r General, (Provi&s;ion being &s;carce &amp; difficult to be obtained, for the Army, that now lay &s;till to Cover the Peo|ple from no body, while they were building a Fort for nothing) retired, and the Power &amp; Trouble of that Po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was left with Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> who &s;till urged the Commanding Officers to more over to <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> &s;ide, to pur&s;ue the Enemy,
<PB N="7" REF="001800_0010_0FB82C1BA8ACD780">and kill <HI>Philip,</HI> which would in his opinion be more probable to keep po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Neck, than to tarry to build a Fort. He was &s;till re&s;tle&s;s on that &s;ide of the River, and the rather becau&s;e of his promi&s;e to the <HI>Squaw Sachem</HI> of <HI>Segkonate.</HI> And Capt. <HI>Fuller</HI> al&s;o urged the &s;ame, until at length there came further order concerning the Fort. And with all, an order for Capt. <HI>Fuller</HI> with Six files to cro&s;s the River to the &s;ide &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on, and to try if he could get Speech with any of the <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI> or <HI>Sogkonate</HI> In|dians, and that Mr. <HI>Church</HI> &s;hould go his Second. Upon the Captains re|ceiving his orders, he ask'd Mr. <HI>Church</HI> whither he was willing to engage in this interprize: To whom 'twas indeed too agreeable to be declined; tho' he thought the enterprize was hazardous enough, for them to have more Men a&s;&s;ign'd them. Capt. <HI>Fuller</HI> told him that for his own part he was grown Ancient and heavy, he feared the travel and fatigue would be too much for him. But Mr. <HI>Church</HI> urged him, and told him, he would thearfully excu&s;e him, his hard&s;hip and travel, and take that part to him&s;elf, if he might but go; for he had rather do any thing in the World than &s;tay there to build the Fort.</P>
<P>Then they drew out the Number a&s;&s;igned them and March'd the &s;ame Night to the Ferry, and were tran&s;ported to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> from whence the next Night they got a pa&s;&s;age over to <HI>Poca&s;&s;et</HI>-&s;ide in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Boats, and concluded there to di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves in two Ambu&s;cado's before day, ho|ping to &s;urprize &s;ome of the Enemy by their falling into one or other of their Ambu&s;ments. But Capt. <HI>Fullers</HI> party being troubled with the Epide|mical plague of lu&s;t after Tobacco, mu&s;t needs &s;trike fire to Smoke it; and thereby di&s;covered them&s;elves to a party of the Enemy coming up to them, who immediately fled with great preciptation.</P>
<P>This Ambu&s;cado drew off about break of day, perceiving they were di&s;|cover'd, the other continued in their Po&s;t until the time a&s;&s;igned them, and the light and heat of the Sun rendred their Station both in&s;ignificant and trouble&s;ome, and then return'd, unto the place of Randezvous, where they were acquainted with the other parties di&s;appointment, and the occa&s;ion of it. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> calls for the breakfa&s;t he had ordered to be brought o|ver in the Boat: but the Man that had the charge of it confe&s;&s;ed that he was a-&s;leep when the Boats-men called him, and in ha&s;te came away and never thought of it. It happened that Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had a few Cakes of Rusk in his Pocket, that Madam <HI>Cran&s;ton</HI> (the Governour of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI>'s Lady) gave him, when he came off the I&s;land, which he divided among the Com|pany, which was all the Provi&s;ions they had.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> after their &s;lender breakfa&s;t propo&s;ed to Capt. <HI>Fuller,</HI> That he would March in que&s;t of the Enemy, with &s;uch of the Company as would be willing to March with him; which he complyed with, tho' with a great deal of &s;cruple, becau&s;e of his &s;mall Number, &amp; the extream hazard he fore|&s;aw mu&s;t attend them.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001800_0011_0FB82CADEC654BA0">
But &s;ome of the Company had reflected upon Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> that notwith|&s;tanding his talk on the other &s;ide of the River, he had not &s;hewn them any <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ince they came over.

<P>The Number allow'd him &s;oon drew off to him, which could not be ma|ny, becau&s;e their whole Company con&s;i&s;ted of no more than Thirty Six.

Had they kept the Track to the Pine Swamp they had been cer|tain of meeting <HI>Indians</HI> enough; but not &s;o certain that any of them &s;hould have return'd to give account how many.</P>
<P>Now they pa&s;s'd down into <HI>Punkatees</HI> Neck; and in their March di&s;co|covered a large Wigwam full of <HI>Indian</HI> Truck, which the Souldiers were for loading them&s;elves with; until Mr. <HI>Church</HI> forbid it; telling them they might expect &s;oon to have their hands full, and bu&s;ine&s;s without caring for Plunder. Then cro&s;&s;ing the head of the Creek into the Neck, they again di&s;covered fre&s;h, Indian Tracks, very larely pa&s;s'd before them into the Neck.

<P>Their next Motion was immediately into the Pea&s;e field.

<P>Seeing &s;uch Multitudes &s;urrounding him and his little Company; it put him upon thinking what was become of the Boats that were ordered to attend him: And looking up, he &s;py'd them a-&s;hore at <HI>Sandy-point</HI> on the I&s;land &s;ide of the River, with a number of Hor&s;e and Foot by them, and wondred what &s;hould be the occa&s;ion; until he was afterwards informed, That the Boats had been over that Morning from the I&s;land and had land|ed a Party of Men at <HI>Fogland,</HI> that were de&s;ign'd in <HI>Punkatees</HI> Neck to fetch off &s;ome Cattel and Hor&s;es, but were Ambu&s;cado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and many of them wounded by the Enemy.</P>
<P>Now our Gentlemans Courage and Conduct were both put to the Te&s;t, the incourages his Men; and orders &s;ome to run and take a Wall to &s;helter before the Enemy gain'd it.

At length came over one of the Boats from the I&s;land Shore, but the Enemy ply'd their Shot &s;o warmly to her as made her keep at &s;ome di&s;tance; Mr. <HI>Church</HI> de&s;ired them to &s;end their Canoo a-&s;hore to fetch them on board; but no per&s;wa&s;ions, nor ar|guments could prevail with them to bring their Canoo to &s;hore.

<P>Away goes the Boat and leaves them &s;till to &s;hift for them&s;elves.

Soon after this, was <HI>Philips</HI> head Quarters vi&s;ited by &s;ome other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces; but <HI>Philip</HI> and his gang had the very fortune to e&s;cape that <HI>Wee|tamore</HI> and hers (but now mentioned) had: they took into a Swamp and their pur&s;uers were commanded back. After this <HI>Dartmouths</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;es re|quired Succour, great Part of the Town being laid de&s;olate, and many of the Inhabitants kill'd; the mo&s;t of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Forces were order'd thither: And coming to <HI>Ru&s;&s;els</HI> Garri&s;on at <HI>Ponegan&s;et,</HI> they met with a Number of the Enemy that had &s;urrendred them&s;elves Pri&s;oners on terms promi&s;ed by Capt. <HI>Eels</HI> of the Garri&s;on; and <HI>Ralph Earl</HI> that per&s;waded them (by a friend <HI>Indian</HI> he had employed) to come in.

<PB N="14" REF="001800_0017_0FB82CBDA9E3A200">our Army made their e&s;cape into the de&s;arts. But Mr. <HI>Church</HI> meeting with fair Winds arriv'd &s;afe at the Major's Garri&s;on in the evening. And &s;oon began to inquire after the Enemies Re&s;orts, Wigwams or Sleeping Places; and having gain'd &s;ome intelligence, he propo&s;ed to the <HI>Eldriges,</HI> and &s;ome other brisk hands, that he met with, to attempt the Surprizing of &s;ome of the Enemy to make a Pre&s;ent of to the General, when he &s;hould arrive: which might advantage his de&s;ign; being brisk blades, they readily com|ply'd with the motion, and were &s;oor upon their March.

<P>Their next move was to a Swamp which the <HI>Indians</HI> had Fortifyed with a Fort. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> rid in the Generals guard when the bloudy ingage|ment began; but being impatient of being out of the heat of the action, importunately beg'd leave of the General that he might run down to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friends, the General yielded to his reque&s;t, provided he could rally &s;ome hands to go with him. Thirty Men immediately drew out and followed him: They entred the Swamp and pa&s;&s;ed over the Log, that was the pa&s;&s;age into the Fort, where they &s;aw many Men and &s;everal Valiant Captains lye &s;lain: Mr. <HI>Church</HI> &s;pying Capt. <HI>Gardner</HI> of <HI>Salem</HI> amid&s;t the Wigwams in the Ea&s;t end of the Fort, made towards him, but on a &s;udden, while they were looking each other in the Face, Capt. <HI>Gardner</HI> &s;ettled down, Mr. <HI>Church</HI> &s;tep'd to him and &s;eeing the blood run down his cheek lifted up his Cap and calling him by his Name; he look'd up in his Face, but &s;poke not a Word, being Mortally Shot thro' the head; and ob&s;erving his Wound, Mr. <HI>Church</HI> found the ball entred his head on the &s;ide that was next the Up|land, where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> entred the Swamp. Upon which, having ordered &s;ome care to be taken of the Captain, he di&s;patch'd information to the Ge|neral that the be&s;t and forwarde&s;t of his Army that hazarded their lives to enter the Fort, upon the muzzle of the Enemies Guns, were Shot in their backs, and kill'd by them that lay behind. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> with his &s;mall Com|pany ha&s;ten'd out of the Fort (that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of) to get a Shot at the <HI>Indians</HI> that were in the Swamp, &amp; kept firing upon them. He &s;oon met with a broad bloody track, where the Enemy had fled with their Wounded men; following hard in the tract, he &s;oon &s;py'd one of the Enemy, who clap'd his Gun a-cro&s;s his brea&s;t, made towards Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> and beckned to him with his hand; Mr. <HI>Church</HI> immediately commanded
<PB N="15" REF="001800_0018_0FB82CBF658149B0">no Man to hurt him, hoping by him to have gain'd &s;ome intelligence of the Enemy, that might be of advantage; but it unhappily fell out that a Fellow that had lag'd behind coming up, &s;hot down the <HI>Indian,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Church</HI>'s great grief and di&s;appointment. But immediately they heard a great &s;hout of the Enemy, which &s;eem'd to be behind them, or between them and the Fort; and di&s;cover'd them running from tree to tree to gain advantages of firing upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that were in the Fort. Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> great diffi|culty now was how to di&s;cover him&s;elf to his Friends in the Fort, u&s;ing &s;e|veral inventions, till at length gain'd an opportunity to call to, and inform a Serjeant in the Fort, that he was there, and might be expo&s;ed to their Shots, unle&s;s they ob&s;erv'd it. By this time he di&s;covered a number of the Enemy almo&s;t within Shot of him, making towards the Fort; Mr. <HI>Church</HI> and his Company were favoured by a heap of bru&s;h that was between them and the Enemy, and prevented their being di&s;cover'd to them. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had given his Men their particular orders for firing upon the Enemy; and as they were ri&s;ing up to make their Shot, the afore mentioned Serjeant in the Fort called out to them, <HI>for God's &s;ake not to fire, for be believed they were &s;ome of their</HI> Friend Indians; they clap'd down again, but were &s;oon &s;en&s;i|ble of the Serjeants mi&s;take. The Enemy got to the top of the Tree, the body whereof the Serjeant &s;tood upon, and there clap'd down out of &s;ight of the Fort, but all this while never di&s;covered Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> who ob&s;erved them to keep gathering unto that Place, until there &s;eem'd to be a formi|dable black heap of them. <HI>Now brave boys</HI> (&s;aid Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to his Men) <HI>if we mind our bits, we may have a brave Shot, and let our &s;ign for firing on them, be their ri&s;ing up to fire into the Fort.</HI> It was not long before the <HI>Indians</HI> ri&s;ing up as one body, de&s;igning to pour a Volley into the Fort. When our <HI>Church</HI> nimbly &s;tarted up and gave them &s;uch a round Volley, and unex|pected clap on their backs, that they who e&s;caped with their Lives, were &s;o &s;urprized, that they &s;campered, they knew not whether them&s;elves; about a dozen of them ran right over the Log into the Fort, and took into a &s;ort of a Hovel that was build with Poles, after the manner of a corn crib. Mr. <HI>Church</HI>'s Men having their Catteridges fix'd, were &s;oon ready to obey his order, which was immediately to charge and run on upon the Hovel, and over-&s;et it, calling as he run on to &s;ome that were in the Fort to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in over-&s;etting of it; they no &s;ooner came to Face the Enemies &s;helter, but Mr. <HI>Church</HI> di&s;cover'd that one of them had found a hole to point his Gun through, right at him; but however incouraged his Company, and ran right on, till he was &s;truck with Three Bullets, one in his Thigh, which was near half of it cut off as it glanced on the joynt of the Hip-bone; a|nother thro' the gatherings of his Breeches and Draws, with a &s;mall fle&s;h Wound; a third peirced his Pocket, and wounded a pair of Mittins, that he had borrowed of Capt. <HI>Prentice;</HI> being wrap'd up together had the mi&s;|fortune

The <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in &s;hort, were di&s;courag'd, and drew back.

And more-over, that the Army had no other Provi&s;ion to tru&s;t unto or depend upon; that be knew that</HI> Plymouth <HI>Forces had not &s;o much as one Bi&s;cake L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ft, for be bad &s;een their la&s;t dealt out,</HI> &amp;c.

But ju&s;t as he was entring the Swamp, one of his Captains meet him, and asked him, <HI>Whither he was going?</HI> He told him into the Fort; the Captain laid hold of his Hor&s;e, and told him, <HI>His Life was worth an bundred of theirs, and he &s;hould not expo&s;e him&s;elf.</HI> The General told him, <HI>That he &s;uppo&s;ed the brunt was over, and that Mr.</HI> Church <HI>had inform'd him that the Fort was taken,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And as the ca&s;e was circum&s;tanced he was of the Mind, that it was mo&s;t practicable for him, and his Army to &s;helter them&s;elves in the Fort.</HI> The Captain in a great heat, reply'd, <HI>That Church ly'd;</HI> and told the General, <HI>That if he mov'd another &s;tep towards the Fort he would &s;hoot his Hor&s;e under him.</HI> Then bru&s;led up another Gentleman, a certain Doctor, and oppo&s;s'd Mr. <HI>Chureh's</HI> advice, and &s;aid, <HI>If it were comply'd with, it would kill more Men than the Enemy had killed; for</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>by to Morrow the wounded Men will be &s;o &s;tiff that there will be no moving of them:</HI> And looking upon Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> and &s;eeing the blood flow|ing a pace from his Wounds, told him, <HI>That if he gave &s;uch advice as that was, he &s;hould bleed to Death like a Dog, before they would endeavour to &s;tench his blood</HI> Though after they had prevailed again&s;t his advice, they were &s;uffi|ciently kind to him. And burning up all the Hou&s;es and Provi&s;ions in the Fort; the Army return'd the &s;ame Night in the Storm and Cold: And I Suppo&s;e every one that is acquainted with the circum&s;tances of that Nights March, deeply laments the mi&s;eries that attended them, e&s;pecially the
<PB N="17" REF="001800_0020_0FB82CC2C7924350">wounded &amp; dying Men. But it mercifully came to pa&s;s that Capt. <HI>Andrew Belcher</HI> arrived at Mr. <HI>Smiths</HI> that very Night from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> with a Ve&s;&s;el loaden with Provi&s;ions for the Army, who mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have peri&s;h'd for want Some of the Enemy that were then in the Fort have &s;ince inform'd as, that near a third of the <HI>Indians</HI> belonging to all that <HI>Narragan&s;et Country</HI> were killed by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and by the Cold that Night, that they fled out of their Fort &s;o ha&s;tily that they carried nothing with them: that if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had kept in the Fort, the <HI>Indians</HI> had certainly been nece&s;&s;itated, either to &s;urrender them&s;elves to them, or to have peri&s;hed by Hunger, and the &s;everity of the Sea&s;on. Some time after this Fort-&s;ight a certain <HI>Sog|honate Indian</HI> hearing Mr. <HI>Church</HI> relate the manner of his being wounded, told him, <HI>That he did not know but he him&s;elf was the</HI> Indian <HI>that wounded him, for that he was one of that company of</HI> Indians <HI>that Mr.</HI> Church <HI>made a Shot up|on when they were ri&s;ing up to make a Shot into the Fort; they were in number a|bout 60 or 70, that ju&s;t then came down from</HI> Pumhams <HI>Town, and never before then fired a Gun again&s;t the</HI> Engli&s;h; <HI>that when Mr.</HI> Church <HI>fired upon them he killed 14 dead in the Spot, and wounded a greater number than he killed, many of which dyed afterwards with their wounds, in the Cold and Storm the following Night.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> was mov'd with other wounded men over to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> where in about a Months time he was in &s;ome good mea&s;ure recovered of his Wounds, and the Fever that attended them.

<P>But the Generals great importunity again per&s;waded him, to accompany him in a long March, into the <HI>Nipmuck</HI> Country, tho' he had then Tents in his Wounds, and &s;o Lame as not able to Mount his Hor&s;e without two Mens a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In this March the fir&s;t thing remarkable was, they came to an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, where there were many <HI>Wigwams</HI> in &s;ight, but an Icy Swamp ly|ing between them and the <HI>Wigwams,</HI> prevented their running at once upon it as they intended: there was much firing upon each &s;ide before they pa&s;s'd the Swamp. But at length the Enemy all fled, and a certain <HI>Moobegan</HI> that was a friend <HI>Indian,</HI> pur&s;ued and &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d one of the Enemy that had a &s;mall wound in his Leg, and brought him before the General, where he was examined.

Mr. <HI>Church</HI> verily believing he had been ingenious in his confe&s;&s;ion, interceeded and prevailed for his e&s;caping torture. But the Army being bound forward in their March, and the <HI>Indians</HI> wound &s;omewhat di&s;inabling him for Tra|velling, 'twas concluded he &s;hould be knock'd on the Head: Accordingly he was brought before a great fire, and the <HI>Moobegan</HI> that took him was allowed, as he de&s;ired, to be the Executiner. Mr.<HI>Church</HI> taking no delight
<PB N="18" REF="001800_0021_0FB82CC4A4D9AF70">in the Sport, fram'd an arrant at &s;ome di&s;tance among the baggage Hor&s;es, and when he had got &s;ome Ten Rods, or thereabouts from the fire, the Executioner fetching a blow with his Hatchet at the head of the Pri&s;oner, he being aware of the blow, dodged his a&s;ide, and the Executioner mi&s;&s;ing his &s;troke the Hatchet &s;lew out of his hand, and had like to have done ex|ecution where 'twas not de&s;ign'd. The Pri&s;oner upon his narrow e&s;cape broke from them that held him, and notwith&s;tanding his Wound made u&s;e of his Legs, and hap'd to run right upon Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> who laid hold on him, and a clo&s;e skuffle they had, but the <HI>Indian</HI> having no Clothes on &s;lip'd from him, and ran again, and Mr. <HI>Church</HI> pur&s;ued the <HI>Indian,</HI> altho' being Lame, there was no great odds in the Race, until the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;tumbled and fell, and they clo&s;ed again, skuffled and &s;ought pretty &s;martly, until the <HI>Indian</HI> by the advantage of his nakedne&s;s &s;lip'd from his hold again, and &s;et out on his third Race, with Mr. <HI>Church</HI> clo&s;e at his heels, endeavouring to lay hold on the hair of his Head, which was all the hold could be taken of him; and running thro' a Swamp that was covered with hollow Ice, it made &s;o loud a noi&s;e that Mr. <HI>Church</HI> expected (but in vain) that &s;ome of his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> friends would follow the noi&s;e, and come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But the <HI>Indian</HI> hap'd to run a-thwart a mighty Tree that lay fallen near brea&s;t-high, where he &s;top'd, and cry'd out a loud for help; but Mr. <HI>Church</HI> being &s;oon upon him again, the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;eized him fa&s;t by the hair of his Head, and endeavouring by twi&s;ting to break his Neck; but tho' Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> wounds had &s;ome-what weakned him, and the <HI>Indian</HI> a &s;tout fellow, yet he held him well in play, and twi&s;ted the <HI>Indians</HI> Neck as well, and took the advantage of many opportunities, while they hung by each others hair gave him noto|rious bunts in the face with his head. But in the heat of this skuffle they heard the Ice break with &s;ome bodies coming a-pace to them, which when they heard, <HI>Church</HI> concluded there was help for one or other of them, but was doubtful which of them mu&s;t now receive the fatal &s;troke; anon &s;ome body comes up to them, who prov'd to be the Indian that had fir&s;t taken the Pri&s;oner. Without &s;peaking a word, he felt them out (for 'twas &s;o dark he could not di&s;tingui&s;h them by &s;ight) the one being clothed, and the other naked, he felt where Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> hands were fa&s;tned in the Ne|tops hair, and with one blow &s;ettled his Hatchet in between them, and end|ed the &s;trife. He then &s;poke to Mr. <HI>Church</HI> and hugg'd him in his Arms, and thank'd him abundantly for catching his Pri&s;oner; and cut off the head of his Victim, and carried it to the Camp, and giving an account to the re&s;t of the friend Indians in the Camp, how Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had &s;eized his Pri&s;oner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they all joyn'd a mighty &s;hout.</P>

<P>His next kennelling Place was at the falls of Connecticut River, where &s;ometime after Capt. <HI>Turner</HI> found him, came upon him by Night, kill'd him a great many Men, and frighted many more into the River, that were hurl'd down the falls and drowned.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> got over the River, and on the back &s;ide of the <HI>Wetu&s;et-hills</HI> meets with all the Remnants of the <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> and <HI>Nipmuck Indians,</HI> that were there gathered together, and became very numerous; and made their de&s;cent on <HI>Sudbury,</HI> and the Adjacent Parts of the Country, where they met with and &s;wallowed up Valiant Capt. <HI>Wad&s;worth</HI> and his Company, and many other doleful de&s;olations, in tho&s;e Parts. The News whereof coming to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and they expecting probably the Enemy would &s;oon return again into their Colony: The Council of War were called together; and Mr. <HI>Church</HI> was &s;ent for to them, being ob&s;erved by the whole Colony to be a Per&s;on extraordinarily qualify'd for and adapted to the Affairs of War. Twas propo&s;ed in Council that lea&s;t the Enemy in their return &s;hould fall on <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> or &s;ome other of their Out-Towns, a Company con&s;i&s;ting of 60 or 70 Men &s;hould be &s;ent in to tho&s;e Parts; and Mr. <HI>Church</HI> invited to take the Command of them. He told them, <HI>That if the Enemy returned into that Colony again, they might rea&s;onably expect that they would come very numerous; and that if be &s;hould take the Command of Men, he &s;hould not lye in any Town or Garri&s;on with them, but would lye in the Woods as the Enemy did: And that to &s;end out &s;uch &s;mall Companies again&s;t &s;uch Multitudes of the Enemy that were now Mu&s;tered together, would be but to deliver &s;o many Men into their hands, to be de|&s;troyed, as the Worthy Capt.</HI> Wad&s;worth <HI>and his Company were.</HI> His advice up|on the whole was. That if they &s;ent out any Forces, to &s;end not le&s;s than 300 Souldiers; and that the other Colonies &s;hould be ask'd to &s;end out their <HI>Quota's</HI> al&s;o; adding, <HI>That if they intended to make an end of the War, by &s;ubduing the Enemy, they mu&s;t make a bu&s;ine&s;s of the War, as the Enemy did; and that for his own part, he had wholly laid a&s;ide all his own private bu&s;ine&s;s and con|cerns, ever &s;ince the War broke out.</HI> He told them, <HI>That if they would &s;end forth &s;uch Forces as he &s;hould direct to, he would go with them for Six weeks March, which was long enough for Men to be kept in the Woods at once; and if they might be &s;ure of Liberty to return in &s;uch a &s;pace, Men would go out chearfully. And he would engage</HI> 150 <HI>of the he&s;t Souldiers &s;hould immediately Li&s;t Voluntarily to go with him, if they would plea&s;e to add</HI> 50 <HI>more; and</HI> 100 <HI>of the Friend Indians; and with &s;uch on Army he made no doubt but he might do good Service; but on other terms he did not incline to be concern'd.</HI></P>
<P>Their reply was, That they were already in debt, and &s;o big an Army would bring &s;uch charge upon them, that they &s;hould never be able to pay. And as for &s;ending out <HI>Indians,</HI> they thought it no wayes advi&s;able, and in &s;hort, none of his advice practicable.</P>

Now Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> Con&s;ort, and his then only Son were till this time remaining at <HI>Duxborough,</HI> and his fearing their &s;afety there (unle&s;s the War were more vigorou&s;ly ingaged in) re&s;olved to move to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land;</HI> tho' it was much oppo&s;ed both by the Government, and by Relations But at length, the Governour con&s;idering that he might be no le&s;s Serviceable by being on that &s;ide of the Colony, gave his permit, and wi&s;h'd he had Twenty more as good Men to &s;end with him.</P>
<P>Then preparing for his Removal, he went with his &s;mall Family to <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> to take leave of their Friends; where they met with his Wives Pa|rents, who much per&s;waded that She might be left at Mr. <HI>Clarks</HI> Garri&s;on, (which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be a mighty &s;afe Place) or at lea&s;t that She might be there until her &s;oon expected lying-inn was over (being near her time.) Mr. <HI>Church</HI> no ways inclining to venture her any longer in tho&s;e Parts, and no arguments prevailing with him he re&s;olutely &s;et out for <HI>Taurton,</HI> and many of their Friends accompanyed them.

<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> being at pre&s;ent di&s;inabled from any particular Service in he War, began to think of &s;ome other employ; but he no &s;ooner took a tool to cut a &s;mall &s;tick, but he cut off the top of his Fore finger, and the next to it, half off; upon which he &s;millingly &s;aid, That he thought he was out of his way, to leave the War; and re&s;olved he would to War again.

For all Travelling was &s;top'd, and no News had pa&s;&s;ed for a long time together.

<PB N="21" REF="001800_0024_0FB82CCC4CD78578">They told him, They were particularly glad that Providence had brought him there at that juncture: For they had concluded the very next day to &s;end out an Army of 200 Men, two third <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and one third <HI>Indians,</HI> in &s;ome mea&s;ure agreeable to his former propo&s;al; expecting <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> to joyn with their <HI>Quota's.</HI> In &s;hort, It was &s;o concluded.

<P>It fell out that as they were in their Voyage pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Sogkonate-point,</HI> &s;ome of the Enemy were upon the Rocks a fi&s;hing; he bid the <HI>Indians</HI> that managed the Canoo to paddle &s;o near to the Rocks as that he might call to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e <HI>Indians;</HI> told them.

Then the <HI>Indians</HI> appearing again, beckn'd and call'd in the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, and bid them come a-&s;hore, they wanted to &s;peak with them. The <HI>Indians</HI> in the Canoo an&s;wered them again; but they on the Rocks told them, That the &s;urff made &s;uch a noi&s;e again&s;t the Rocks, they could not hear any thing they &s;aid. Then Mr. <HI>Church</HI> by &s;igns with his hands, gave to under&s;tand, That he would have two of them go down upon the point of the beach (a place where a Man might &s;ee who was near him) accordingly two of them ran a-long the beach, and met him there; without their Arms excepting that one of them had a Lance in his hand; they uged Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to come a-&s;hore for they had a great de&s;ire to have &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with him; He told them, if he that had his weapon in his hand would carry it up &s;ome di&s;tance upon the beach and leave it, he would come a-&s;hore and di&s;cour&s;e them: He did &s;o, and Mr. <HI>Church</HI> went a-&s;hore, halled up his Canoo, or|dered one of his <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;tay by it, and the other to walk above on the beach, as a Sentinel to &s;ee that the Coa&s;ts were clear. And when Mr. <HI>Church</HI> came up to the <HI>Indians,</HI> one of them happened to be hone&s;t <HI>George,</HI> one of the two that <HI>Awa&s;honks</HI> formerly &s;ent to call him to her Dance, and was &s;o careful to guard him back to his Hou&s;e again; the la&s;t <HI>Sogkonate Indian</HI> he &s;poke with before the War broke out; he &s;poke <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very well.
<PB N="22" REF="001800_0025_0FB82CCD789FCDC8">Mr. <HI>Church</HI> asked him where <HI>Awa&s;honks</HI> was? he told him in a Swamp about three Miles off. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> again asked him, What it was he wanted that he hollowed and called him a-&s;hore? he an&s;wered, That he took him for <HI>Church</HI> as &s;oon as he heard his Voice in the Canoo, and that he was very glad to &s;ee him alive, and he believed his Mi&s;tri&s;s would be as glad to &s;ee him, and &s;peak with him; he told him further, That he believed &s;he was not fond of maintaining a War with the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and that &s;he had left <HI>Philip,</HI> and did not intend to return to him any more; he was mighty ear|ne&s;t with Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to tarry there while he would run and call her: but he told him no; for he did not know but the <HI>Indians</HI> would come down and kill him before he could get back again; he &s;aid, if <HI>Mount-hope</HI> or <HI>Poce&s;&s;et Indians</HI> could catch him, he believed they would knock him on the head: But all <HI>Sogkonate Indians</HI> knew him very well, and he believed would none of them hurt him.

<P>Accordingly he appointed him to notifie <HI>Awa&s;honks,</HI> her Son <HI>Peter,</HI> their Chief Captain and one <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pa&s;h</HI> (an <HI>Indian</HI> that Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had formerly a particular re&s;pect for) to meet him two dayes after, at a Rock at the lower end of Capt. <HI>Richmonds</HI> Farm; which was a very noted place; and if that day &s;hould prove Stormy, or Windy, they were to expect him the next moderate day. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> telling <HI>George,</HI> that he would have him come with the Per&s;ons mentioned, and no more. They giving each other their hand upon it parted, and Mr. <HI>Church</HI> went home, and the next Morning to <HI>New port,</HI> and informed the Government, what had pa&s;&s;ed between him and the <HI>Sogkonate Indians.</HI> And de&s;ired their permit for him and <HI>Daniel Wilcock,</HI> (a Man that well under&s;tood the <HI>Indian</HI> Language) to go over to them. They told him, They thought he was mad, after &s;uch Service <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s he had done, and &s;uch dangers that he e&s;caped, now to throw away his Life, for the Rogues would as certainly kill him, as ever he went over; and utterly refu&s;ed to grant his permit, or to be willing that he &s;hould run the ri&s;que.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> told them, <HI>That it had ever been in his thoughts &s;ince the War broke out, that if he could di&s;cour&s;e the</HI> Sogkonate Indians, <HI>he could draw them off from</HI> Philip, <HI>and employ them again&s;t him; but could, till now, never have an Opportu|nity to &s;peak with any of them, and was very lothe to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e it,</HI> &amp;c. At length, they told him, If he would go, it &s;hould be only with the two <HI>Indians</HI> that came with him; but they would give him no permit under their hands. He took his leave of them, Re&s;olving to pro&s;ecute his de&s;ign; they told him they were &s;orry to &s;ee him &s;o Re&s;olute, nor if he went did they ever expect to &s;ee his face again.</P>
<P>He bought a Bottle of Rhum, and a &s;mall role of Tobacco, to carry with him, and returned to his Family. The next Morning, being the day ap|pointed

<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> ask'd <HI>George</HI> Whether <HI>Awa&s;honks</HI> and the other <HI>Indians</HI> he ap|pointed to meet him were there? He an&s;wered they were.

However he went a-&s;hore, where he was no &s;ooner landed, but <HI>Awa&s;honks</HI> and the reft that he had ap|pointed to meet him there, ro&s;e up and came down to meet him; and each of them &s;ucce&s;&s;ively gave him their hands, and expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves glad to &s;ee him, and gave him thanks for expo&s;ing him&s;elf to vi&s;it them.

<P>The Interpreter asked Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> if he under&s;tood what it was that the great fellow (they had hold of) &s;aid?

<P>Then the chief Captain commanded <HI>Silence,</HI> and told them, That they &s;hould talk no more about old things, &amp;c. and quell'd the tumult, &s;o that they &s;at down again, and began upon a di&s;cour&s;e of making Peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Mr. <HI>Church</HI> ask'd them, <HI>What Propo&s;als they would make, and on what terms they would break their League with</HI> Philip?

<P>Then he propo&s;ed unto them, that they &s;hould choo&s;e five men to go &s;traight with him to <HI>Plymouth:</HI> They told him, No; they would not choo&s;e, but he &s;hould take which five he plea&s;ed: &s;ome complements pa&s;&s;ed about it, at length it was agreed, They &s;hould choo&s;e Three and he Two. Then he agreed, with that he would go back to the I&s;land that Night, and would come to them the next Morning, and go thro' the Woods to <HI>Plymouth.</HI> But they afterwards objected, That this travelling thro' the Woods would not be &s;afe for him; the Enemy might meet with them, and kill him, and then they &s;hould lo&s;e their friend, and the whole de&s;ign ruined be&s;ide. And therefore propo&s;ed, That he &s;hould come in an Engli&s;h Ve&s;&s;el and they would meet him and come on board at <HI>Sogkonate-point,</HI> and Sail from thence to <HI>Sandwich:</HI> which in fine, was concluded upon.</P>
<P>So Mr. <HI>Church</HI> promi&s;ing to come as &s;oon as he could po&s;&s;ibly obtain a Ve&s;&s;el, and then they parted. He returned to the I&s;land, and was at great pains and charge to get a Ve&s;&s;el, but with unaccountable di&s;appointments, &s;ometimes by the fal&s;ene&s;s, and &s;ometimes by the faint-heartedne&s;s of Men that he bargained with, and &s;omething by Wind and Weather, &amp;c.</P>

Accordingly, finding no <HI>Indians</HI> there, they waited until late in the Night, when they arrived with their booty. They di&s;patch'd a Po&s;t to their Captain to give him an ac|count of their Succe&s;s; but the day broke before they came to him: And when they had compared Succe&s;&s;es, they very remarkably found that the number that each Company had taken and &s;lain, was equal. The <HI>Indians</HI> had kill'd 3 of the Enemy, and taken 63 Pri&s;oners, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had done before them, both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> were &s;urpriz'd at this remarkable Pro|vidence, and were both parties rejoycing at it; being both-before afraid of what might have been the event of the unequal Succe&s;s of the parties. But the <HI>Indians</HI> had the fortune to take more Arms than the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> They told the Captain, <HI>That they had mi&s;&s;ed a brave Opportunity by parting; They came upon a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at Town of the Enemy,</HI> viz <HI>Capt.</HI> Tyasks <HI>company, (Tyasks</HI> was the next man to <HI>Philip) They fired upon the Enemy before they were di&s;covered, and ran upon them with a &s;hout; the Men ran and left their Wives and Children, and many of them their Guns: They took</HI> Tyasks <HI>Wife and Son, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'t that if their Captain &amp; the Engli&s;h company had been with them they might have taken &s;ome hundreds of them: And now they determined not to part any more.</HI></P>
<P>That Night <HI>Philip</HI> &s;ent (as afterwards they found out) a great Army to way-lay Capt. <HI>Church</HI> at the entring on of <HI>A&s;&s;awomp&s;et</HI> Neck, expecting he would have returned the &s;ame way he went in; but that was never his me|thod to return the &s;ame way that he came; &amp; at this time going another way he e&s;caped falling into the hands of his Enemies. The next day they went home by <HI>Sapican,</HI> and got well with their Pri&s;oners to <HI>Plymouth.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;oon went out again; and this &s;troke he drove many Weeks; and when he took any number of Pri&s;oners, he would pick out &s;ome that he took a fancy to, and would tell them, <HI>He took a particular fancy to them, and had cho&s;e them for him&s;elf to make Souldiers of; and if any would behave them&s;elves well, be would do well by them, and they &s;hould be his men and not Sold out of the Country.</HI>

<P>Capt. <HI>Church</HI> was in two particulars much advantaged by the great <HI>Eng|i&s;h</HI> Army that was now abroad. One was, that they drove the Enemy down to that part of the Country, <HI>viz.</HI> to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Taunton</HI> River by which means his bu&s;ine&s;s was nearer home. The other was that when ever he fell on with a pu&s;h upon any body of the Enemy (were they never &s;o many) they fled expecting the great Army. And his manner of Marching thro' the Woods was &s;uch, as if he were di&s;covered, they appeared to be more than they were. For the always Marched at a wide di&s;tance one from another, partly for their &s;afety: and this was an <HI>Indian</HI> cu&s;tom, to March thin and &s;catter. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> inquired of &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> that were become his Souldiers, <HI>How they got &s;uch advantage often of the Engli&s;h in their Marches thro' the Woods?</HI> They told him, That the <HI>Indians</HI> gain'd great advantage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by two things; The <HI>Indians</HI> always took care in their Marches and Fights, not to come too thick together. But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> always kept in a heap together, that it was as ea&s;y to hit them as to hit an Hou&s;e. The o|ther was, that if at any time they di&s;covered a company of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Souldi|ers in the Woods, they knew that there was all, for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> never &s;cat|tered; but the <HI>Indians</HI> always divided and &s;cattered.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Church</HI> now at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> &s;omething or other happen'd that kept him at home a few days, until a Po&s;t came to <HI>Mar&s;hfield</HI> on the Lords day Morn|ing, informing the Governour that a great Army of <HI>Indians</HI> were di&s;cove|red, who it was &s;uppo&s;ed were de&s;igning to get over the River towards <HI>Taunton</HI> or <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> to Attack tho&s;e Towns that lay on that &s;ide the Ri|ver.

<P>Next Morning Capt. <HI>Church</HI> moved very early with his Company which was increa&s;ed by many of <HI>Bridgwater</HI> that li&s;ted under him for that Expedi|tion, and by their Piloting, he &s;oon came very &s;till, to the top of the great Tree which the Enemy had fallen a-cro&s;s the River; and the Captain &s;py'd an <HI>Indian</HI> &s;itting upon the &s;tump of it on the other &s;ide of the River; and he clap'd his Gun up, and had doubtle&s;s di&s;patch'd him, but that one of his own <HI>Indians</HI> called ha&s;tily to him, Not to fire for he believed it was one of his own men; upon which the <HI>Indian</HI> upon the &s;tump lock'd about, and Capt. <HI>Churbes Indian</HI> &s;eeing his face perceived his mi&s;take, for he knew him to be <HI>Philip;</HI> clap'd up his Gun and fired, but it was too late, for <HI>Philip</HI> im|mediately threw him&s;elf off the &s;lump, leap'd down a bank on the &s;ide of the River, and made his e&s;cape.

That he and all that belonged to <HI>Annawon</HI> were ordered to come that way, and none could come any other way without difficulty or danger of being &s;hot. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> then ordered the old man and his daughter to go down fore mo&s;t with their baskets at their backs, that when <HI>Annawon</HI> &s;aw them with their baskets he &s;hould not mi&s;tru&s;t the intregue; Capt. <HI>Church</HI> and his handful of Souldiers crept down al&s;o under the &s;hadow of the&s;e two and their bas|kets, and the Captain him&s;elf crept clo&s;e behind the old man, with his Hat|chet in his hand, and &s;tep'd over the young mans head to the Arms, the young <HI>Annawon</HI> di&s;covering of him, whip'd his blanket over his head and &s;hrunk up in a heap: The old Capt. <HI>Annawon</HI> &s;tarted up on his breech, and cryed out <HI>Howoh,</HI> and de&s;pairing of e&s;cape throw him&s;elf back again, and lay &s;ilent until Capt. <HI>Church</HI> had &s;ecured all the Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And having &s;e|cured that company, he &s;ent his <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers to the other fires &amp; com|panies, giving them in&s;tructions, what to do and &s;ay. Accordingly, they went into the mid&s;t of them: When they di&s;covered them&s;elves who they were, told them that their Capt. <HI>Annawon</HI> was taken, and it would be be&s;t for them quietly and peaceably to &s;urrender them&s;elves, which would pro|cure good quarter for them: Otherwi&s;e if they &s;hould pretend to re&s;i&s;t or make their e&s;cape, it would be in vain, and they could expect no other but that Capt. <HI>Church</HI> with his great Army, who had now entrap'd them, would cut them to pieces: told them al&s;o if they would &s;ubmit them&s;elves, and deliver up all their Arms unto them, and keep every man his place un|til it was day; they would a&s;&s;ure them that their Capt. <HI>Church</HI> who had been &s;o kind to them&s;elves when they &s;urrendred to him, &s;hould be as kind unto them. Now they being old acquaintance, and many of them Relations did much the readier give heed to what they &s;aid, and complyed &amp; &s;urrendred up their Arms unto them, both their Guns and Hatchets <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and were forth|with carryed to Capt. <HI>Church.</HI> Things being &s;o far &s;ettled, Capt. <HI>Church</HI> asked <HI>Annawon,</HI> What he had for Supper, for (&s;aid he) I am come to Sup

The Captain told him Cow-beaf would be mo&s;t acceptable: It was &s;oon got ready, and pulling his little bag of Salt out of his Pocket, which was all the Provi&s;ion he brought with him; this &s;ea&s;on'd his Cow beaf &s;o that with it and the dry'd green-corn, which the old Squaw was pounding in the Mortar, while they were &s;liding down the Rocks, he made a very hearty Supper. And this pounding in the Mortar proved lucky for Capt. <HI>Churches</HI> getting down the Rocks, for when the old Squaw pounded they moved, and when &s;he cea&s;ed to turn the corn, they cea&s;ed creeping, the noi&s;e of the Mortar prevented the Enemies hearing their creeping: and the corn being now dre&s;&s;ed &s;upplyed the want of Bread, and gave a fine reli&s;h with the Cow-beaf. Supper being over, Capt. <HI>Church</HI> &s;ent two of his men to inform the other companies, that he had killed <HI>Philip,</HI> and had taken their friends in <HI>Mount-hope</HI> Neck, but had &s;pared their lives, and that he had &s;ubdued now all the Enemy (he &s;uppo&s;ed) excepting this company of <HI>Annawons,</HI> and now if they would be orderly and keep their places until Morning, they &s;hould have good quarter, and that he would carry them to <HI>Taunton,</HI> where they might &s;ee their friends again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Me&s;&s;engers return'd, that the <HI>Indians</HI> yielded to his propo&s;als. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> tho't it was now time for him to take a Nap, having had no &s;leep in two days and one night before; told his men that if they would let him &s;leep two hours, they &s;hould &s;leep all the reft of the night. He lay'd him&s;elf down and endeavoured to &s;leep, but all di&s;po&s;ition to &s;leep departed from him. After he had lain a little while he looked up to &s;ee how his Watch managed, but found them all fa&s;t a-&s;leep. Now Capt. <HI>Church</HI> had told Capt, <HI>Annawons</HI> company as he had ordered his <HI>Indians</HI> to tell the others, that their lives &s;hould all be &s;pared, excepting Capt. <HI>Annawons,</HI> and it was not in his power to promi&s;e him his life, but he mu&s;t carry him to his Ma&s;ters at <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> and he would intreat them for his life. Now when Capt. <HI>Church</HI> found not only his own men, but all the <HI>Indians</HI> fa&s;t a-&s;leep <HI>Annawon</HI> only excepted, whom he perceived was as broad awake as him&s;elf; and &s;o they lay looking one upon the other perhaps an hour; Capt. <HI>Church</HI> &s;aid nothing to him, for he could not &s;peak <HI>Indian,</HI> and tho't <HI>Annawon</HI> could not &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> at length <HI>Annawon</HI> rai&s;ed him&s;elf up, ca&s;t off his blanket, and with no more clothes than his &s;mall breeches, walked a little way back from the company: Capt. <HI>Church</HI> tho't no other but that he had occa&s;ion to ea&s;e him|&s;elf, and &s;o walked to &s;ome di&s;tance rather than offend him with the &s;tink: but by and by he was gone out of &s;ight and hearing; and then Capt. <HI>Church</HI> began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome ill de&s;ign in him, and got all the Guns clo&s;e him, and crouded him&s;elf clo&s;e under young <HI>Annawon,</HI> that if he &s;hould any where

The Moon now &s;hining bright, he &s;aw him at a di&s;tance coming with &s;omething in his hands, and coming up to Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> he fell upon his knees before him, and offer'd him what he had bro't, and &s;peaking in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Great Captain, you have killed</HI> Philip, <HI>and conquered his Country for I believe, that I &amp; my company are the la&s;t that War again&s;t the</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>&s;o &s;uppo&s;e the War is ended by your means; and therefore the&s;e things belong unto you.</HI> Then opening his pack, he pull'd out <HI>Philip:</HI> belt curiou&s;ly wrought with <HI>Wompom,</HI> being Nine inches broad, wrought with black and white <HI>Wompom,</HI> in various figures and flowers, and pictures of many birds and bea&s;ts.

Then he pulled out two horns of glazed Powder, and a red cloth Blanket: he told Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> the&s;e were <HI>Philips</HI> Royalties which he was wont to adorn him&s;elf with when he &s;at in State.

<P>Capt. <HI>Church</HI> had been but a little while at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> before he was infor|med of a parcel of <HI>Indians,</HI> that haunted the Woods between <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Sippican</HI> that did great damage to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in killing their Cattel, Hor&s;es, and Swine; and the Captain was &s;oon in pur&s;uit of them: Went out from <HI>Plymouth</HI> the next Monday in the afternoon; next Morning early they di&s;|covered a Track; the Captain &s;ent two <HI>Indians</HI> on the Track to &s;ee what they could di&s;cover, while he and his Company followed gently after, but
<PB N="53" REF="001800_0056_0FB82D14F66E4F98">the two <HI>Indians</HI> &s;oon returned with Tydings that they had di&s;covered the Enemy &s;itting round their fires, in a thick place of bru&s;h. When they came pretty near the place, the Captain ordered every man to creep as he did; and &s;urround them by creeping as near as they could, till they &s;hould be di&s;|covered, and then to run on upon them and take them alive, if po&s;&s;ible, (for their Pri&s;oners were their pay:) They did &s;o, took every one that was at the fires, not one e&s;caping. Upon examination they agreed in their Story, that they belonged to <HI>Ti&s;paquin,</HI> who was gone with <HI>John Bump,</HI> and one more, to <HI>Agawom</HI> and <HI>Sippican</HI> to kill Hor&s;es, and were not expected back in two or three days. This &s;ame <HI>Ti&s;paquin</HI> had been a great Captain, and the <HI>Indians</HI> reported that he was &s;uch a great <HI>Pouwau,</HI> that no bullet could enter him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> &s;aid, He would not have him killed, for there was a War broke out in the Ea&s;tern Part of the Country, and he would have him &s;aved to go with them to fight the <HI>Ea&s;tern Indians.</HI> Agreeably he left two old Squaws of the Pri&s;oners, and bid them tarry there until their Capt. <HI>Ti&s;paquin</HI> returned, and to tell him, that <HI>Church</HI> had been there, and had taken his Wife, Children, and company, and carryed them down to <HI>Plymouth;</HI> and would &s;pare all their lives, and his too, if he would come down to them and bring the other two that were with him, and they &s;hould be his Souldiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> then returned to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> leaving the old Squaws well provided for, and Bisket for <HI>Ti&s;paquin</HI> when he returned: Telling his Soul|diers, that he doubted not but he had laid a Trap that would take him Capt. <HI>Church</HI> two days after went to <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> (the Commi&s;&s;ioners then &s;itting) and waited upon the Honourable Governour <HI>Leverett,</HI> who then lay Sick; who reque&s;ted of Capt. <HI>Church</HI> to give him &s;ome account of the War: who readily obliged his Honour therein, to his great Satisfaction, as he was plea|&s;ed to expre&s;s him&s;elf; taking him by the hand, and telling him, if it plea|&s;ed God he lived, he would make it a brace of a hundred pounds advantage to him out of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Colony, and would endeavour the reft of the Colonies &s;hould do Proportionably; but he dyed within a Fortnight af|ter, and &s;o nothing was done of that nature.

He ask'd them, Where? They an&s;wered, That they ran over the head of the River by the Cedar Swamp, and were running into the Neck towards the Town: There being but one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man with him, he bid his <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers &s;cat|ter, run very thin to pre&s;erve them&s;elves and the better able to make a di&s;|covery of the Enemy: &amp; &s;oon coming to Lieut. <HI>Clarks</HI> field on the South &s;ide of the Neck, and &s;eeing the Cattel feeding quietly, and perceiving no Track, concluded the Ambo&s;cade had told them a fal&s;ehood; they ha&s;tily return'd back to the &s;aid Bridge, perceiving there was no noi&s;e of the Enemy. He hearing &s;everal great Guns fire at the Town, concluded that they were either a&s;&s;aulted or that they had di&s;cover'd the Enemy: He having ordered that in ca&s;e &s;uch &s;hould be, that they &s;hould fire &s;ome of their great Guns to give him notice; he being a Stranger to the Country, concluded the Enemy had by &s;ome other way got to the Town: whereupon he &s;ent his Men to the Town, and him&s;elf going to the River, near where the fight had been; ask'd them how they did? and what was become of the Enemy? who inform'd him that the Enemy drew off in le&s;s than an hour after he left them, and had not fired a Gun at them &s;ince. He told them he had been within little more than a Gun &s;hot of the back of the Enemy, and had been upon them had it not been for the thick bru&s;hy ground, &amp;c. Now &s;ome of his Men returning from the Town gave him the account, that they went while they &s;aw the Colours &s;tanding &amp; Men walking about as not mole&s;ted. He pre&s;ently ordered that all his Army &s;hould pur&s;ue the Enemy: But they told him that mo&s;t of them had &s;pent their Ammunition, and that if the Enemy had engaged them a little longer they might have come &amp; knock'd them on the head; and that &s;ome of their Bullets were &s;o un&s;izeable that &s;ome of them were forc'd to make &s;lugs while they were ingag'd. He then order'd them to get over all the wounded and dead men, and to leave none behind: which was done by &s;ome Canoo's they had got. Capt. <HI>Hall</HI> and his men being fir&s;t ingaged did great Service, and &s;uffered the greate&s;t lo&s;s in his Men.

Being oblig'd to buy him a Hor&s;e to go home by land, that &s;o he might the better comply with his orders. The poor People the Inhabitants of <HI>Ca&s;co</HI> and Places Adjacent, when they &s;aw he was going away from them, lamented &s;adly, &amp; beg'd earne&s;tly that he would &s;uffer them to come away in the Tran&s;ports; &s;aying if he left them there, that in the Spring of the Year the Enemy would come and de&s;troy 'em and their Families, &amp;c. So by their earne&s;t reque&s;t the &s;aid Maj. <HI>Church</HI> promi&s;ed them, that if the Go|vernments that had now &s;ent him, would &s;end him the next Spring, he would certainly come with his Volunteers and <HI>Indians</HI> to their relief: And that as &s;oon as he had been at home, and taken a little care of his own bu&s;ine&s;s, he would certainly wait upon the Gentlemen of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and inform them of the Promi&s;e he had made to them; and if they did not &s;ee cau&s;e to &s;end 'em relief, to intreat their Honours &s;ea&s;onably to draw them off, that they might not be a prey to the barbarous Enemy. Taking his leave of tho&s;e poor In|habitants &s;ome of the chief men there waited upon him to <HI>Black Point,</HI> to Capt <HI>Scottaways</HI> Garti&s;on; coming there they prevail'd with the &s;aid Capt. <HI>Scottaway</HI> to go with him to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which he readily comply'd with, provi|ded the &s;aid <HI>Church</HI> would put another in to Command the Garri&s;on; which being done and taking their leaves one of another, they &s;et out and travel|led thro' all the Country home to <HI>Bo&s;ton:</HI> (having imploy'd him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to fulfill his In&s;tructions la&s;t received from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Gentlemen, which co&s;t him about a Months Service more and above what he had pay from <HI>Plymouth</HI> Gentlemen) and in his travel homeward &s;everal Gentlemen wait|ed upon the &s;aid Maj <HI>Church</HI> who was oblig'd to bare their Expences.

<HEAD>The Second Expedition, <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1690. was the Expedition to <HI>Canada,</HI> and Maj. <HI>Walley</HI> often re|que&s;ted Maj <HI>Church</HI> that if he would not go him&s;elf in that Expedition, that he would not hinder others: He an&s;wered the &s;aid <HI>Walley,</HI> That he &s;hould hinder none but his old Souldiers, that us'd to go along with him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the &s;aid Church going down to <HI>Charle&s;town</HI> to take his leave of &s;ome of his Relations, and Friends, who were going in that Expedition, promi&s;ed his Wife and Family not to go into <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the Small Pox being very brief there. Coming to <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> &s;everal of his Friends in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> came over to &s;ee him; and the next day after the &s;aid <HI>Church</HI> came there, Maj. <HI>Walley</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="001800_0070_0FB82D371FEF2008">came to him, and inform'd him, That the Governour and Council wanted to &s;peak with him: He an&s;wered him, That he had promis'd his Wife and Family not to go into <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> &s;aying, If they had any bu&s;ine&s;s, they could Write to him, and that he would &s;end them his an&s;wer. Soon after came over two other Gentlemen with a Me&s;&s;age, that the Governour &amp; Council wanted to have &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with him. The an&s;wer return'd was, That he intended to lodge that Night at the <HI>Gray-bound,</HI> in <HI>Roxbury,</HI> and that in the Morning would come to <HI>Pollards</HI> at the South End of <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> which ac|cordingly he did: &s;oon after he came thither received a Letter from the Honourable Capt. <HI>Sewall,</HI> to reque&s;t him to come to the Council; the an|&s;wer he return'd by the bearer was, That he thought there was no need of his hazarding him&s;elf &s;o much as to come &amp; &s;peak with them; not that he was afraid of his Life, but becau&s;e he had no mind to be concern'd any fur|ther, by rea&s;on they would not hearken to him about the poor People of <HI>Ca&s;co.</HI> But immediately came Mr. <HI>Maxfield</HI> to him, &s;aying, That the Coun|cil bid him tell the &s;aid <HI>Church,</HI> That if he would take his Hor&s;e and ride along the middle of the Street there might be no danger, they were then &s;itting in Council: He bid him go and tell his Ma&s;ters. Not to trouble them|&s;elves, whether he came upon his head or feet, he was coming: however thinking the return was &s;omething rude, call'd him back to drink a Gla&s;s of Wine, and then he would go with him. So coming to the Council, They were very thankful to him for his coming; and told him that the occa&s;ion of their &s;ending for him was, That there was a Captive come in who gave them an account. That the <HI>Indians</HI> were come down and had taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the Stone Fort at <HI>Pejep&s;cot,</HI> &s;o that they wanted his advice &amp; thoughts about the matter; whither they would tarry and keep in that Fort or not? and whither it was not expedient to &s;end &s;ome Forces to do &s;ome &s;poil up|on them; and further to know whither he could not be prevail'd with to Rai&s;e &s;ome Volunteers and go, to do &s;ome &s;poil upon them? He an&s;wer'd them, he was unwilling to be concern'd any more; it being very difficult and chargeable to Rai&s;e Volunteers, as he found by experience in the la&s;t Expedition. But they u&s;ing many arguments prevail'd &s;o far with him, That if the Government of <HI>Plymouth</HI> &s;aw cau&s;e to &s;end him (he would go) think|ing the Expedition would be &s;hort. Took his leave of them &amp; went home. And in a &s;hort time after there came an Expre&s;s from Governour <HI>Hinkley,</HI> to reque&s;t Maj <HI>Church</HI> to come down to <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> to him: he having recei|ved a Letter from the Government of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to rai&s;e &s;ome Forces to go <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> whereupon the &s;aid Maj. <HI>Church</HI> went the next day to <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> as ordered; finding the Governour and &s;ome of the Council of War there, di&s;cous'd him, concluding that he &s;hould take his <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers, and two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captains with what Volunteers as could be rai&s;ed; and that one Capt &s;hould go our of <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> County, and the other out of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> County, with

<SALUTE>Worthy Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to my promi&s;e when with you la&s;t, I waited upon the Go|vernent at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> upon the Saturday, Capt. <HI>Conver&s;e</HI> being with me. The Governour informed us that the Council was to meet on the Monday following in the afternoon, at which time we both there waited upon them, and gave them an account of the State of your Country, and great ne|ce&s;&s;ities. They informed us, that their General Court was to Convene on the Wedne&s;day following; at which time they would debate &amp; con&s;i|der of the matter; my &s;elf being bound home, Capt. <HI>Conver&s;e</HI> was ordered to wait upon them, and bring you their re&s;olves. I then took notice of the Council that they look'd upon me with an ill a&s;pect, not judging me worthy to receive thanks for the Service I had done in your parts; nor as much as ask me whether I wanted Money to bare my Expence, or a Hor&s;e to carry me home. But I was forc'd for want of Money (being far from friends) to go to <HI>Roxbury</HI> on foot; but meeting there with a <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Gentleman, acquainted him of my wants, who tendered me <HI>en Pounds,</HI> whereby I was accommodated for my Journey home: And being come home, I went to the Mini&s;ter of our Town, and gave him an account of the tran&s;actions of the great affairs I had been imploy'd in, and of the great
<PB N="78" REF="001800_0081_0FB82D55A5054F68">favour God was plea&s;ed to &s;hew me, and my Company, and the benefit I hoped would accrue to your &s;elves; and de&s;ired him to Return Publick Thanks: but at the &s;ame interim of time a Paper was pre&s;ented unto him from a Court of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> which was holded before I came home, to Command a day of Humiliation thro' the whole Government, becau&s;e of the frowns of God upon tho&s;e Forces &s;ent under my Command, and the ill &s;ucce&s;s we had, for want of good conduct. All which was cau&s;ed by tho&s;e fal&s;e Reports which were po&s;ted home by tho&s;e ill affected Officers that were under my Conduct; e&s;pecially one which your &s;elves very well know, who had the advantage of being at home a Week before me, being &s;ick of Action, and wanting the advantage to be at the Bank, which he every day was mindful of more than fighting the Enemy in their own Country. After I came home, being inform'd of a General Court at <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> and not forgetting my faithful Promi&s;e to you, and the duty I lay under, I went thither, where waiting upon them, I gave them an account of my Ea&s;tward tran&s;actions, and made them &s;en&s;ible of the fal&s;ene&s;s of tho&s;e reports that were po&s;ted to them by ill hands, and found &s;ome &s;mall favourable acceptance with them, &s;o far that I was credited. I pre&s;ented your Thanks to them for their &s;ea&s;onable &s;ending tho&s;e Forces to relieve you, with that expence and charge they had been at; which Thanks they gratefully received; and &s;aid a few Lines from your &s;elves would have been well accepted. I then gave them an account of your great nece&s;&s;ities by being impri&s;oned in your Garri&s;ons, and the great mi&s;chief that would attend the Publick concerns of this Country by the lo&s;s of their Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t, and &s;o much good E&s;tate of yours &amp; your Neighbours; as doubt|le&s;s would be on the de&s;erting of your Town. I then moved for a free Contribution for your relief, which they with great forwardne&s;s promo|ted; and then ordered a day of Thanksgiving thro' the Government up|on the 26th. day of this In&s;tant. Upon which day a Collection was or|dered for your relief (and the Places near Adjacent) in every re&s;pective Town in this Government; and for the good management of it that it might be &s;afely convey'd unto your hands, they appointed a Man in each County for the reception &amp; conveyance thereof. The per&s;ons nominated and accepted thereof, are: For the County of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> Capt. <HI>Nathanael Thomas</HI> of <HI>Mar&s;hfield:</HI> For the County of <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> Capt. <HI>Jo&s;eph Lathrop</HI> of <HI>Barn&s;table:</HI> And for the County of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> my &s;elf. Which when gather|ed you will have a particular account from each per&s;on, with orders of advice how it may be di&s;po&s;ed of for your be&s;t advantage, with a Copy of the Courts order. The Gentlemen the effects are to be &s;ent to are your &s;elves that I now Write to, <HI>viz. John Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elwright</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Capt. <HI>John Littlefield,</HI> and Lieut. <HI>Jo&s;eph Story</HI> I defer'd writing expecting every day to hear from you concerning the <HI>Indians</HI> coming to treat about their Pri&s;oners that we
<PB N="79" REF="001800_0082_0FB82D56A2579C58">had taken. The di&s;cour&s;e I made with them at <HI>Ameras-cogen,</HI> I know would have that Effect as to bring them to a treaty, which I &s;hould have thought my &s;elf happy to have been improved in, knowing that it would have made much for your good. But no intelligence coming to me from any Gentlemen in your parts, and hearing nothing but by accident, and that in the latter end of the week by &s;ome of ours coming from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in|formed me that the <HI>Indians</HI> were come in to your Town to &s;eek for Peace; and that there was to be a treaty &s;peedily; but the time they know not. I took my Hor&s;e, and upon the Monday &s;et out for <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> expecting the treaty had been at your Town, as rationally it &s;hould, but on Tue&s;day Night coming to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> there met with Capt. <HI>Eli&s;ha Andros,</HI> who informed me that the Place of treaty was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acaty-b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck,</HI> and that Capt <HI>Alden</HI> was gone from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> four days before I came there, and had carryed all the <HI>Indian</HI> Pri&s;oners with him, and that all the Forces were drawn away out of your parts, except 12 men in your Town, and 12 in <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;cataqua,</HI> which news did &s;o amu&s;e me, to &s;ee that wi&s;dom was &s;o taken from the wi&s;e, and &s;uch im|prudence in their actions, as to be deluded by <HI>Indians;</HI> and to have a treaty &s;o far from any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Town, and to draw off the Forces upon what pre|tence &s;oever, to me looks very ill. My fear is that they will deliver tho&s;e we have taken, which if kept would have been greatly for your Security, it keeping them in awe, and preventing them from doing any ho&s;tile acti|on or mi&s;chief, I knowing that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being a broad are very earne&s;t to go home, and the <HI>Indians</HI> are very tedious in their di&s;cour&s;es, and by that will have an advantage to have their Captives at a very low rate to your great damage. <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> as to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> I have not concern'd my &s;elf as to any relief for you, having nothing in writing to &s;how to them, yet upon di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome Gentlemen there, they have &s;ignified a great forwardne&s;s to promote &s;uch a thing. I lying under great reflections from &s;ome of yours in the Ea&s;tward parts, that I was a very Covotous Per&s;on, and came there to enrich my &s;elf, and that I kill'd their Cattel and Bar|rel'd them up and &s;ent them to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and Sold them for Plunder, and made Money to put into my own Pocket; and the owners of them being poor People beg'd for the Hides and Tallow, with tears in their eyes; and that I was &s;o cruel as to deny them; which makes me judge my &s;elf uncapa|ble to Serve you in that matter: yet I do a&s;&s;ure you that the People are ve|ry charitable at the <HI>I&s;land,</HI> and forward in &s;uch good actions, and therefore advi&s;e you to de&s;ire &s;ome good &s;ub&s;tantial Per&s;on to take the management of it, and write to the Government there, which I know will not be labour loft. As for what I am accu&s;ed of, you all can witne&s;s to the contrary, and I &s;hould take it very kindly from you to do me that ju&s;t right, as to vindicate my Reputation; for the wi&s;e man &s;ays, <HI>A good Name is as precious Oyntment.</HI> When I hear of the effect of the Treaty, and have an account

<P>Then the Major and his Forces embark'd and made the be&s;t of their way to <HI>Penob&s;cot;</HI> and coming to an I&s;land in tho&s;e Parts in the evening, landed his Forces at one end of the &s;aid I&s;land: Then the Major took part of his Forces and mov'd toward Day to the other end of the &s;aid I&s;land, where they found two <HI>French Men,</HI> and their Families in their hou&s;es; and that one or both of them had <HI>Indian</HI> Women to their Wives, and had Children by them. The Major pre&s;ently examining the <HI>French men,</HI> Where the <HI>Indians</HI> were? They told him, That there was a great company of them upon an I&s;land ju&s;t by: and &s;howing him the I&s;land, pre&s;ently di&s;cover'd &s;everal of them. Maj. <HI>Church</HI> and his Forces &s;till keeping undi&s;cover'd to them, ask'd the <HI>French men</HI> where their pa&s;&s;ing Place was? Which they readily &s;hew'd him; &s;o pre&s;ently placed an Amba&s;cade to take any that &s;hould come over. Then &s;ent orders for all the re&s;t of the Forces to come; &s;ending them an account what he had &s;een &amp; met withal; &s;trickly charging them to keep them&s;elves undi&s;covered by the Enemy. The Amba&s;cade did not lye long before an <HI>Indian</HI> Man and a Woman came over in a Canoo to the Place for landing, where the Amba&s;cade was laid: who haul'd up their Canoo, and came right into the hands of our Amba&s;cade, who &s;o &s;uddenly &s;urprized them that they could not give any notice to the others from whence they came; the Major ordering that none of his &s;hould offer to meddle with the Canoo, le&s;t they &s;hould be di&s;covered, hoping to take the mo&s;t of them if his Forces came as order'd, he expecting them to come as directed. But the fir&s;t news he had of them was, That they were all coming, tho' not privately
<PB N="85" REF="001800_0088_0FB82D672830D950">as ordered; but in the Ve&s;&s;els fair in &s;ight of the Enemy, which &s;oon put them all to flight: and our Forces not having Boats &s;uitable to pur&s;ue them, they got all away in their Canoo's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which cau&s;ed Maj <HI>Church</HI> to &s;ay, He would never go out again without &s;ufficient number of Whale-boats) which for want of, was the ruine of that action. Then Maj. <HI>Church</HI> ac|cording to his In&s;tructions rang'd all tho&s;e parts to find all their Corn, and carried aboard their Ve&s;&s;els what he thought convenient, and de&s;troy'd the re&s;t.

<P>Then his Excellency taking leave went for <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> and &s;oon after Maj. <HI>Church</HI> and his Forces had a &s;mart fight with the Enemy in <HI>Kenebeck</HI>-River, Pur&s;ued them &s;o hard that they left their Canoo's &amp; ran up into the woods, &s;till pur&s;ued them up to their Fort at <HI>Taconock,</HI> which the Enemy perceiving &s;et fire to their Hou&s;es in the Fort, and ran away by the light of them, and when Maj. <HI>Church</HI> came to the &s;aid Fort found about half their Hou&s;es &s;tand|ing and the re&s;t burnt; al&s;o found great quantities of Corn, put up into Indian Cribs, which he and his Forces de&s;troyed, as ordered. Having done what Service he could in tho&s;e parts return'd to <HI>Pemequid,</HI> and coming there imploy'd his Forces according to his In&s;tructions: being out of Bread, his Excellency not coming, Maj. <HI>Church</HI> was oblig'd to borrow Bread of the Captain of the Man of War that was then there for all the Forces under his Command, his Excellency not coming as expected. But at length his Ex|cellency came and brought very little Bread more than would pay what was borrowed of the Man of War: So that in a &s;hort time after Maj. <HI>Church</HI> with his Forces return'd home to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and had their Wages for their good Service done.

<P>In the time Maj. <HI>Church</HI> lay at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the News came of <HI>Pemequid</HI> Fort being taken, it came by a Shallop that brought &s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pri&s;oners to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> who gave account al&s;o that there was a French Ship at Mount-<HI>De&s;art,</HI> who had taken a Ship of ours; &s;o the di&s;cour&s;e was that they would &s;end the Man of War, with other Forces to take the &s;aid French Ship and retake ours.

So having done his bu&s;ine&s;s there, went with what Forces he had there to <HI>Winter Harbour,</HI> where he had the &s;ame account from Capt. <HI>Gorham,</HI> That they had not di&s;covered any of the Enemy, nor any new Tracks: So concluding they were gone from tho&s;e Parts towards <HI>Penob&s;cot;</HI> the Major ordered all the Ve&s;&s;els to come to Sail and make the beft of their way to <HI>Monbegin,</HI> which being not far from <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> where the main body of our Enemies living was; being in great hopes to come up with the Army of <HI>French &amp; Indians,</HI> before they had &s;cattered and were gone pa&s;t <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> or Mount-<HI>De&s;art,</HI> which is the chief place of their

Night coming on to their Oars again, working very hard, turn'd the Night into Day; made &s;everal of their new Souldiers grumble: but telling them they hoped to come up quickly with the Enemy put new life into them; and by day-light they got into the Mouth of the River, where landing, found many Randezvous and fire Places where the <HI>Indians</HI> had been; but at the &s;ame &s;pace of time, as before mentioned.

<P>The Major having read his la&s;t Orders, and con&s;idering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Commi&s;&s;ion, found that he was oblig'd to attend, <HI>All Orders,</HI> &amp;c. was much concern'd that he and his were prevented in their intended projection, if carryed back to St. <HI>John's.</HI> Then di&s;cour&s;ing with Col. <HI>Hathorne,</HI> gave him an account of what they had done at St. <HI>John's, viz.</HI> That as to the demoli&s;hing the New Fort they had done it, and got all their great Guns and Stores aboard their Ve&s;&s;els; and that if it had not been that the waters were &s;o low would have taken the Fort up the River al&s;o before he came away. Told him al&s;o that one of the Pri&s;oners which he had taken at St. <HI>John's,</HI> upon examination concerning the <HI>Indians</HI> in tho&s;e parts, told him, it was as hard for <HI>Vilboon</HI> their Governour to get one of their <HI>Indians</HI> down to the water &s;ide, as to carry one of tho&s;e great Guns upon his back: and that they had an account of him and his Forces coming to tho&s;e parts by a Pri&s;oner out of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Goal. Al&s;o
<PB N="98" REF="001800_0101_0FB82C2084007D88">told his Honour, That if they went back it would wholly di&s;appoint them of their doing any further Service, which was that they came for to <HI>Penob&s;|cot,</HI> and Places Adjacent; but all was to no purpo&s;e, his Honour telling the Major that he mu&s;t attend his Orders then received. And to incourage the Officers and Souldiers, told them, They &s;hould be wholly at the Majors Ordering &amp; Command in the whole action: (and to be &s;hort did go back) and the event may be &s;een in Col. <HI>Hathron's</HI> Journal of the &s;aid action. Only I mu&s;t ob&s;erve one thing by the way, which was, That when they drew off to come down the River again, Col. <HI>Hathorne</HI> came off and left the Major behind to &s;ee that all the Forces were drawn off; and coming down the River in or near the Rear, in the Night heard a per&s;on hollow, not knowing at fir&s;t but that it might be a &s;nare to draw them into; but upon con&s;idera|tion &s;ent to &s;ee who or what he was, found him to be a Negro man belong|ing to <HI>Marblehead,</HI> that had been taken, and kept a Pri&s;oner among&s;t them for &s;ome time.

One thing more I would ju&s;t give a hint of, that is, How the <HI>French</HI> in the Ea&s;tward parts were much &s;urpriz'd at the motion of the Whale boats; &s;aid, There was no abiding for them in that Country: and I have been inform'd &s;ince, that &s;oon after this Expedition, they drew off from St. <HI>John's</HI> Fort &amp; River But to return, Then going all down the River, Embark'd and went homeward; only by the way <HI>Candid Reader,</HI> I would let you know of two things that proved very prejudicial to Major <HI>Church</HI> and his Forces: The fir&s;t was, That the Government &s;hould mi&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o much as to &s;end any Pri&s;oner away from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> before the Expedition was over.

<ITEM>7ly. <HI>That there may be rai&s;ed for this Service</HI> 300 Indians <HI>at lea&s;t, &amp; more if they may be had; for I know certainly of my own knowledge, that they exceed mo&s;t of our</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>in hunting &amp; &s;culking in the woods, being always us'd to it; and it mu&s;t be practi&s;ed if ever we intend to de&s;troy tho&s;e</HI> Indian <HI>Enemies.</HI></ITEM>

Being al&s;o ask'd, What number of <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French</HI> there were at <HI>Penob&s;cot?</HI> He an&s;wered, there were &s;everal Families, but they liv'd &s;cattering. Ask'd him further, If he would Pilot our Forces thither? An&s;wered, He would if the Com|mander would not let the Salvages Roft him. Upon which the Colonel ordered him to be loo&s;ed from the Stake, and took him by the hand, told him, He would be as kind to him as his own Father; at which he &s;eemed to be very thankful. And then the Colonel proceeded to examine his Bro|ther <HI>Tom,</HI> and told him that he had examined his Father and Brother, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his Brother had told him every tittle he knew; and that he knew more than b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Brother <HI>Timothy</HI> did; and that if he would be Ingenious &amp; confe&s;s all he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iew, he &s;hould fare as well as his Brother, but if not, the Salvages &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;t him.

In the evening we entred in at the We&s;tward Harbour at &s;aid <HI>Pa&s;&s;amequado;</HI> coming up &s;aid Harbour to an I&s;land, where landing, we came to a French hou&s;e, and took a French Woman, and Children, the Woman upon her Examination &s;aid, her Husband was abroad a Fi&s;hing. I ask'd her, whither there were any <HI>Indians</HI> thereabouts? She &s;aid, Yes. There were a great many, and &s;everal on that I&s;land. I ask'd her, whither &s;he could Pilot me to them? Said, No. They hid in the Woods. I ask'd her, when &s;he &s;aw them? An&s;wered, Ju&s;t now, or a little while &s;ince, I ask'd
<PB N="109" REF="001800_0112_0FB82C3D69722B20">her, whether &s;he knew where they had laid their Canoo's? An&s;wered, No. They carried their Canoo's into the woods with them. We then ha&s;tened away a-long &s;hore, &s;eizing what Pri&s;oner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e could, taking old <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">riel</HI> and his Family. This intelligence caus'd me to leave Col, <HI>Gorham,</HI> and a con|&s;iderable part of my Men (and Boats) with him at that I&s;land, partly to guard and &s;ecure tho&s;e Pri&s;oners, being &s;en&s;ible it would be a great trou|ble to have them to &s;ecure and guard at our next landing, where I did really expect, and hope to have an opportunity, to &s;ight our <HI>Indian</HI> Enemies; for all our French Pri&s;oners, that we had taken at <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> and a-long &s;hore had informed us, That when we came to the Place, where the&s;e <HI>Ca|nada</HI> Gentlemen lived, we &s;hould certainly meet with the Salvages to &s;ight us, tho&s;e being the only Men that &s;et the <HI>Indians</HI> again&s;t us, or upon us, and were newly come from <HI>Canada,</HI> to manage the War again&s;t us (plea|ding in this account and information their own Innocency) and partly in hopes that he the &s;aid Col. <HI>Gorham</HI> would have a good opportunity in the Morning to de&s;troy &s;ome of tho&s;e our Enemies, (we were informed by the &s;aid French Woman as above,) with the u&s;e of his Boats, as I had given di|rection. Ordering al&s;o Maj. <HI>Hilton,</HI> to pa&s;s over to the next I&s;land, that lay Ea&s;t of us (with a &s;mall Party of Men and Boats) to &s;urprize &amp; de&s;troy any of the Enemy, that in their Canoo's might go here or there, from any place, to make their flight from us, and as he had opportunity to take any <HI>French</HI> Pri&s;oners. We then immediately moved up the River in the dark Night thro' great difficulty, by rea&s;on of the Eddys and Whirlpools, made with the fiercene&s;s of the current. And here it may be hinted that we had information that <HI>Lotriel</HI> had loft &s;ome of his Family pa&s;&s;ing over to the next I&s;land, falling into one of the&s;e Eddys were drowned; which the two Pi|lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> told to di&s;courage me. But I &s;aid nothing of that nature &s;hall do it, for I was re&s;olved to venture up, and therefore forthwith Paddling our Boats, as privately as we could, and with as much expedition as we could make with our Paddles, and the help of a &s;trong Tide, we came up to Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Gourdons,</HI> a little before day; where taking notice of the Shoar, and finding it &s;omewhat open and clear, I ordered Capt. <HI>Mirick</HI> and Capt. <HI>Cole,</HI> (having Engli&s;h Companies) to tarry with &s;everal of the Boats to be ready, that if any of the Enemy &s;hould come down out of the bru&s;h into the Bay, (it being very broad in that place) with their Canoo's, they might take and de&s;troy them. Ordering the remainder of the Army, being landed, (with my &s;elf and the other Officers) to March up into the Woods, with a wide Front, and to keep at a confiderable di&s;tance; for that if they &s;hould run in heaps, the Enemy would have the greater advantage: and further directing them that if po&s;&s;ible, they &s;hould de&s;troy the Enemy with their Hatches, and not fire a Gun. This order I alwayes gave at landing telling them the inconveniency of firing, in that it might be fir&s;t dange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">,
<PB N="110" REF="001800_0113_0FB82C3EEA5952E8">to them&s;elves, they being many of them Young Souldiers, (as I had &s;ometimes ob&s;erved, that one or two Guns being &s;ired, many others would &s;ire, at they knew not what; as happened pre&s;ently after) and it would alarm the Enemy, and give them the opportunity to make their e&s;cape; and it might alarm the whole Country, and al&s;o prevent all further action from taking effect Orders being thus pa&s;&s;ed, we moved directly towards the Woods, <HI>Le Faver's</HI> Son directing us to a little Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t or Wigwam, which we immediately &s;urrounded with a few Men, the re&s;t Marching directly up into the Woods, to &s;ee what Wigwams or Hutts they could di&s;cover; my &s;elf made a little flop Ordering the Pilot to tell them in the Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, that they were &s;urrounded with an Army, and that if they would come forth, and &s;urrender them&s;elves, they &s;hould have good quarter, but if not, they &s;hould be all knock'd on the head and die: One of them &s;hewed him&s;elf, I ask'd, Who he was? He &s;aid <HI>Gourdan;</HI> and begg'd for quarter: I told him he &s;hould have good quarter; adding further, That if there were any more in the hou&s;e they &s;hould come out: Then came out two men; <HI>Gourdan</HI> &s;aid, They were his Sons, and asked quarter for them, which was al&s;o granted. Then came out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Woman, and a little Boy; &s;he &s;ell upon her knees, begg'd quarts for her &s;elf and Children, and that I would not &s;uffer the <HI>Indians</HI> to kill them. I told them they &s;hould have good quarter and not be hurt. After which I ordered a &s;mall guard over them, and &s;o mov'd pre&s;ently up with the re&s;t of my Company, after them that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re gone before, but looking on my right hand over a little run, I &s;aw &s;ome thing look black, ju&s;t by me, &s;topped, and heard a talking, &s;tepped over, and &s;aw a little Hurt or Wigwam with a crowd of People round a bout it, which was contrary to my former directions: Ask'd them what they were doing? They reply'd there was &s;ome of the Enemy in a hou&s;e, and would not come out. I ask'd what Hou&s;e? They &s;aid a Bark hou&s;e. I ha&s;tily bid them pull it down, and knock them on the head, never asking whether they were <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Indians;</HI> they being all Enemies alike to me. And pi&s;&s;ing then to them, and &s;eeing them in great di&s;order, &s;o many of the Ar|my in a crowd together, acting &s;o contrary to my Command &amp; Direction, expo&s;ing them&s;elves, and the whole Army to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter ruine, by then &s;o di&s;|orderly crowding thick together; had an Enemy come upon them in that interim, and fired a Volley among&s;t them, they could not have mi&s;s'd a &s;hot; and wholly neglecting their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y, in not attending my orders, in &s;earching diligently for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">g Enemies in their Wigwams, or by their &s;ires where I had great hopes, and real expectation to meat with them. I mo&s;t certainly know that I was in an exceeding great Pa&s;&s;ion, but not with tho&s;e poor mi&s;erable Enemies; for I took no notice of half <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> dozen of the Enemy, when at the &s;ame time, I expected to be engaged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome hundreds of them, of whom we had a continued account who
<PB N="111" REF="001800_0114_0FB82C43E76192D0">were expected from <HI>Port Royal</HI> &s;ide. In this heat of action, every word that I then &s;poke, I cannot give an account of, and I pre&s;ume it is impo&s;|&s;ible. I &s;top'd but little here, but went directly up into the woods, hoping to be better imployed, with the re&s;t of the Army, I li&s;ten'd to hear, and looked earne&s;tly to &s;ee what might be the next action; but meeting with many of the Souldiers, They told me, they had di&s;covered nothing; we fetching a &s;mall compa&s;s round, came down again. It being pretty dark, I took notice, I &s;aw two men lay dead as I thought, at the end of the hou&s;e, where the door was, and immediately the Guns went off, and they fired every man as I thought, and mo&s;t towards that place where I left the guard with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Gourdan.</HI> I had much ado to &s;top their firing, and told them, I thought they were mad, and I believed they had not killed and wounded le&s;s than 40 or 50 of our own Men. And I asked them what they &s;hot at? They an&s;wered at a French man that ran away: but to admiration no man was kill'd but he, &amp; one of our own men wounded in the Leg; and I turning about, a French man &s;poke to me, and I gave him quarter. Day-light coming on and no di&s;covery made of the Enemy, I went to the place where I had left Mon&s;ieur <HI>Gourdan,</HI> to examine him, and his Sons, who agreed in their examinations; told me two of their men were abroad: It prov'd a damage; and further told me, That Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Sharkee</HI> lived &s;everal Leagues up at the head of the River, at the Falls; and all the <HI>Indians</HI> were fi&s;hing, and tending their Corn there; and that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Sharkee</HI> had &s;ent down to him, to come up to him to advi&s;e about the <HI>Indian</HI> Army, that was to go We&s;tward; but he had returned him an&s;wer, his bu&s;ine&s;s was urgent, and he could not come up: and that <HI>Sharkee,</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> would certainly be down that day, or the next at the furthe&s;t, to come to conclude of that matter. This was a &s;hort Nights action, and all &s;en&s;ible Men do well know, that actions done in the dark (being in the Night as afore&s;aid) under &s;o many difficulties, as we then laboured under, as before related, was a very hard Task for one Man, mat|ters being circum&s;tanc'd as in this action; which would not admit of cal|ling a Council; and at that time could not be confin'd there-unto; at which time I was tran&s;ported above fear or any &s;ort of dread; yet being &s;en&s;ible of the danger in my Armies crowding &s;o thick together, and of the great duty incumbent on me to pre&s;erve them from all the danger I po&s;&s;i|bly could, for further improvement, in the De&s;truction of our implacable Enemies; am ready to conclude, that I was very quick &amp; ab&s;olute in giving &s;uch Commands &amp; Orders, as I then apprehended mo&s;t proper and advantagious. And had it not been for the Intelligence I had received from the <HI>French</HI> we took at <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> as before hinted, and the fal&s;e report the <HI>French</HI> Woman (fir&s;t took) gave me, I had not been in &s;uch ha&s;te. I que&s;tion not but tho&s;e <HI>French</HI> men that were &s;lain, had the &s;ame good quar|ter
<PB N="112" REF="001800_0115_0FB82C44DF42DE60">of other Pri&s;oners. But I ever look'd at it a good Providence of Al|mighty God, that &s;ome few of our cruel &amp; bloody Enemies, were made &s;en&s;ible of their bloody Cruelties, perpetrated on my dear &amp; loving friends and Country men; and that the &s;ame mea&s;ure (in part) meeted to them, as they had been guilty of in a barbarous manner at <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erfield,</HI> &amp; I hope ju&s;tly, I hope God Almighty will accept hereof, altho' it may not be eligible to our <HI>French</HI> implacable Enemies, and &s;uch others as are not our friends. The fore-going Journal and this &s;hort annexment, I thought it my duty to exhibit, for the &s;atisfaction of my Friends &amp; Country-men, whom I very faithfully &amp; willingly &s;erved in the late Expedition; and I hope will find acceptance with you.

<P>This Nights Service being over immediately Col. <HI>Church</HI> leaves a &s;uffici|ent guard with <HI>Gourdan,</HI> and the other Pri&s;oners, mov'd in &s;ome Whale-boats with the re&s;t; and as they were going &s;py'd a &s;mall thing upon the Water, at a great di&s;tance, which proved to be a birch Canoo, with two <HI>Indians</HI> in her; the Colonel pre&s;ently ordered the lighte&s;t boat he had to make the be&s;t of her way and cut them off from the Shore: but the <HI>Indians</HI> perceiving their de&s;ign run their Canoo a &s;hore &amp; fled. Col. <HI>Church</HI> fearing they would run directly to <HI>Sharkee</HI> made all the expedition imaginable; but it being ebb and the water low, was obliged to land &amp; make the be&s;t of their way thro' the woods, hoping to intercept the <HI>Indians,</HI> and get to <HI>Sharkee's</HI> hou&s;e before them; which was two Miles from where our Forces landed. The Colo|nel being Ancient &amp; Unwildy, de&s;ired Serjeant <HI>Edee</HI> to run with him, and coming to &s;everal Trees fallen, which he could not creep under or readily get over, would lay his brea&s;t again&s;t the Tree the &s;aid <HI>Edee</HI> turning him over, generally had Cat luck, falling on his feet, by which means kept in the Front: and coming near to <HI>Sharkee's</HI> hou&s;e, di&s;covered &s;ome <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Indians</HI> making a Wair in the River, and pre&s;ently di&s;covered the two <HI>Indians</HI> afore|mentioned, who call'd to them at work in the River; told them ther was an Army of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> ju&s;t by; who immediately left their work and ran, endeavouring to get to <HI>Sharkee's</HI> hou&s;e; who hearing the noi&s;e, took his Lady &amp; Child, and ran into the woods. Our Men running briskly fired &amp; kill'd one of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and took the re&s;t Pri&s;oners. Then going to <HI>Sharkee's</HI> hou&s;e found a Woman and Child, to whom they gave good quar|ter: and finding that Madam <HI>Sharkee</HI> had le&s;t her Silk Clothes &amp; fine linen behind her, our Forces was de&s;irous to have pur&s;ued and taken her: But Col <HI>Church</HI> fothid them, &s;aying he would have her run and &s;uffer, that &s;he might be made &s;en&s;ible, what hard &s;hips our poor People had &s;uffered by them, &amp;c. Then proceeded to examine the Pri&s;oners newly taken, who gave
<PB N="113" REF="001800_0116_0FB82C4694158678">him the &s;ame account he had before; of the <HI>Indians</HI> being up at the Falls, &amp;c. It being ju&s;t Night prevented our Attacking of them that Night. But next Morning early they mov'd up to the Falls (which was about a Mile higher:) But doubtle&s;s the Enemy had &s;ome Intelligence by the two afore|&s;aid <HI>Indians,</HI> before our Forces came, &s;o that they all got on the other &s;ide of the River and left &s;ome of their goods by the Water-&s;ide, to decoy our Men, that &s;o they might fire upon them; which indeed they effected: But thro' the good Providence of God never a Man of ours was kill'd; and but one &s;lightly wounded. After a &s;hort di&s;pute Col. <HI>Church</HI> ordered that every Man might take what they plea&s;ed of the Fi&s;h which lay bundled up, and to burn the re&s;t, which was a great quantity. The Enemy &s;eeing what our Forces were about; and that their &s;tock of Fi&s;h' was de&s;troyed, and the &s;ea|&s;on being over for getting any more, &s;et up a hedious Cry, and &s;o ran all away into the woods; who being all on the other &s;ide of the River, ours could not follow them. Having done, our Forces March'd down to their Boats at <HI>Sharkee's,</HI> and took their Pri&s;oners, Bever, and other Plunder which they had got, and put it into their Boats, and went down to <HI>Gourdams</HI> hou&s;e, where they had left Lieut. Col. <HI>Gorbam</HI> &amp; Maj <HI>Hilton,</HI> with part of the Forces to guard the Pri&s;oners; (and kept a good look-out for more of the Enemy) who upon the Colonels return, gave him an account that they had made no di&s;covery of the Enemy &s;ince he left them, &amp;c. Ju&s;t then Her Majefly's Ships and Tran&s;ports arriving. The Commanders of Her Maje&s;ty's Ships told Gol. <HI>Church</HI> that they had orders to go directly for <HI>Port Royal Gut,</HI> and wait the coming of &s;ome Store-Ships, which were expected at <HI>Port Royal</HI> from <HI>France;</HI> and Col. <HI>Church</HI> advi&s;ing with them, propo&s;ed that it was very expedient and &s;erviceable to the Crown, that Capt. <HI>Southack</HI> in the Pro|vince Galley &s;hould accompany them, which they did readily acquie&s;ce with him in. Upon which the Colonel immediately embark'd his Forces on board the Tran&s;ports, and him&s;elf on board Capt. <HI>Jarvis;</HI> ordering the Commi&s;&s;ary of the Stores, the Mini&s;ter, Surgeons &amp; Pilots all to embark on board the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el with him; ordering all the Whale boats to be put on board the Tran&s;ports, and then all to come to Sail. The Ships &s;tanding away for <HI>Port Royal Gut,</HI> and Col, <HI>Church</HI> with the Tran&s;ports for <HI>Menis:</HI> In their way the Colonel inquired of the Pilot&mdash;<HI>Fellows,</HI> What depth of Water there was in the Crick near the Town of <HI>Menis?</HI> He an&s;wered him that there was Water enough near the Town to flote that Ve&s;&s;el they were in at low Water, So when coming near, Col. <HI>Church</HI> ob&s;erved a Woody I&s;land between them and the Town, that they run up on the back-&s;ide of the &s;aid I&s;land, with all their Tran&s;ports undi&s;covered to the Enemy, and came to Anchor. Then the Colonel and all his Forces embark'd in the Whale boats it being late in the day mov'd directly for the Town, and in the way ask'd for the Pilot, whom he expected was in one of the Boats but he had given him the &s;lap and tarried behind. The Colonel not know|ing

And &s;o came down in the Night &amp; fired &s;martly at our Forces; but Col. <HI>Church</HI> being in a Pinis that had a &s;mall Cannon plac'd in the head, order|ed it to be charg'd &s;everal times, with Bullets in &s;mall bags, and fired at the Enemy, which made &s;uch a rattling among&s;t the Trees, that cau&s;ed the E|nemy to draw off; and by the great Providence of Almighty God not one of our Forces was hurt that Night; (but as I have been informed they had one <HI>Indian</HI> kill'd, and &s;ome others wounded, which was &s;ome di&s;courage|ment to the Enemy.) Next Morning by break of Day, Col. <HI>Church</HI> or|dered all his Forces, (and plac'd Maj. <HI>Hilton</HI> on the right wing,) to run all up driving the Enemy before them, who leaving their Town to our Forces, but had carried away the be&s;t of their Goods (which were &s;oon found by our Souldiers.)

Our Souldiers not having been long in Town before they found con&s;iderable quantities of Strong Drink (both Brandy &amp; Claret) and being very greedy after it, e&s;pecially the <HI>Indians,</HI> were very di&s;orderly, firing at every Pig, Turky or Fowl they &s;aw, of which were very plenty in the Town; which indanger'd our own Men: Col. <HI>Church</HI> perceiving the di&s;order, and firing of his own Men, ran to put a &s;top to it, had &s;everal &s;hot come very near him; and finding what had occa&s;ion'd this di&s;order, commanded his Officers to knock out the heads of every Cask of Strong Liquor they could find in the Town, to prevent any further di&s;turbance a|mong&s;t his Army; knowing it was impo&s;&s;ible to have kept it from them, e&s;pecially the <HI>Indians,</HI> if it was &s;aved, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then &s;ome of the Army who were de&s;irous to pur&s;ue the Enemy, having heard them driving away their Cattel, Reque&s;ted the Colonel to let them go; who did: and gave them their orders. Capt. <HI>Cooke,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Church</HI> to lead the two Wings, and Lieut. <HI>Barker</HI> who led the Colonels Company in the Center: and the &s;aid Capt. <HI>Cooke</HI> and Capt. <HI>Church</HI> de&s;ired Lieut. <HI>Barker</HI> not to move too fa&s;t; &s;o that he might have the benefit of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if he had occa&s;ion; but the &s;aid Lieutenant not being &s;o careful as he &s;hould have been, or at lea&s;t was too eager, was &s;hot down, and another Man; which were all the Men that were kill'd in the whole Expedition. Towards Night Col. <HI>Church</HI> ordered &s;ome of his Forces to pull down &s;ome of the Hou&s;es, and others to get Logs
<PB N="116" REF="001800_0119_0FB82C50EA9B2678">and make a Fortification for his whole Army to lodge in that Night, that &s;o they might be together: and ju&s;t before Night ordered &s;ome of his Men to go &s;ee if there were any Men in any of the Hou&s;es in the Town; if not, to &s;et them all a fire: which was done, and the whole Town &s;eemed to be of a fire all at once, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The next Morning the Colonel gave orders to his Men to dig down their Dams, and let the Tide in to de&s;troy all their Corn, and every thing that was good, according to his In&s;tructions; and to burn the Fortification which they had built the Day before: And when the Tide &s;erv'd to put all their Plunder which they had got into the Boats. Then ordering his Souldiers to March at a good di&s;tance one from another; which caus'd the Enemy to think that there was not le&s;s than a thou&s;and Men (as they &s;aid afterwards:) and that their burning of the Fortification, and doing as they did, cau&s;ed the Enemy to think that they were gone clear off and not to return again. But it proved to the contrary, for Col. <HI>Church</HI> and his Forces only went aboard their Tran&s;ports, and there &s;taid till the Tide &s;erv'd; in the Night embarked on board their Whale-boats, landed &s;ome of his Men, expecting they might meet with &s;ome of the Enemy mending their Dams; which they did, and with the Boats went up another branch of the River, to another Town or Village; upon &s;uch a &s;urprize took as many Pri&s;oners as they could de&s;ire. And it happened that Col. <HI>Church</HI> was at the French Captains Hou&s;e when two Gentlemen that came Po&s;t from the Governour of <HI>Port Royal</HI> to him, who was the Chief Com|mander at <HI>Menis,</HI> with in Expre&s;s to &s;end away two Companies of Men to Defend the Kings Fort there; and to give him an account, That there was three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War come into <HI>Port Royal Gut</HI> or Harbour; and that the Men &s;ent for mu&s;t be Po&s;ted away with all &s;peed. Col. <HI>Church,</HI> as was &s;aid before, being there, treated the two Gentlemen very han&s;omely, and told them, He would &s;end them back again Po&s;t to their Ma&s;ter upon his bu&s;ine&s;s; and bid them give him his hearty thanks for &s;ending him &s;uch good News, that part of his Fleet was in &s;o good a Harbour. Then reading the Summons to them that he had &s;ent to <HI>Menis.</HI> Further added, That their Ma&s;ter the Governour of <HI>Port Royal</HI> mu&s;t immediately &s;end away a Po&s;t to the Governour of <HI>Canada</HI> at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> to prevent his further &s;ending any of his cruel &amp; bloudy <HI>French</HI> and Salvages, as he had done lately upon <HI>Deerfield,</HI> where they had committed &s;uch horrible and bloudy outrages upon tho&s;e poor People, that never did them any harm, as is intollerable to think of; and that for the future, if any &s;uch Ho&s;tilities were made upon our Fron|tier Towns, or any of them, He would come out with a thou&s;and Salvages, and Whale boats convenient, and turn his back upon them, and let his Sal|vages Scalp &amp; Ro&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> or at lea&s;t treat them as their Salvages had treated ours: Al&s;o gave them an account of part of that action at <HI>Pa&s;&s;a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ado,</HI> and how that his Souldiers had Kill'd &amp; Scalp'd &s;ome <HI>Canada</HI> Men

The two French Gentlemen that came Po&s;t made &s;olemn Promi&s;es that they would punctually do the Colo|nel's Me&s;&s;age to their Governour. So with the de&s;ire of the French People there that the Governour might have this Intelligence, Col. <HI>Church</HI> di&s;mi&s;s'd them, and &s;ent them away; telling the &s;ame Story to &s;everal of the Pri&s;o|ners, and what they mu&s;t expect if &s;ome &s;peedy cour&s;e was not taken up prevent further outrages upon the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The number of Pri&s;oners then Pre&s;ent (which were con&s;iderable) did unanimou&s;ly intreat of Col. <HI>Church,</HI> that he would take them under the Protection of the Crown of <HI>England;</HI> making great Promi&s;es of their fidelity to the &s;ame, begging with great A|gony of Spirit to Save their Lives, and to protect them from his Salvages, whom they extreamly dreaded: As to the matter of the Salvages, He told them, It would be ju&s;t Retaliation for him to permit his Salvages to treat the <HI>French</HI> in the &s;ame manner, as the <HI>French</HI> with their Salvages treated our friends in our Frontier Towns: But as to his taking them under the Protecti|on of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> he utterly refu&s;ed it, urging to them their for|mer Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s; they al&s;o urging to him, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for any <HI>French</HI> to live any where in the Bay of <HI>Fundy,</HI> if they were not taken under the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government; for with the benefit of tho&s;e Whale-boats, (as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> called them) they could take and de&s;troy all their People in the Town of <HI>Menis</HI> in one Night: But he reply'd to them, It &s;hould never be; alledging to them that when they were &s;o before, when <HI>Port Royal</HI> was taken la&s;t by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that it prov'd of very ill con&s;equence to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> &amp; the Subjects thereof in our Frontiers; for that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Traders &s;upplying them; enabled them (which opportunity they improv'd) to &s;up|ply the <HI>Indians</HI> our bloudy Enemies; and therefore he could make no other Terms of Peace with them than that; if they the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Menis, Signect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> would keep at home with their bloudy Salvages, and not commit any Ho&s;tilities upon any of our Frontiers, we would return home &amp; leave them; for that we lived a great di&s;tance off, and had not come near them to hurt them now had not the blood of our poor Friends and Brethren in all the Frontiers of our Province cryed for Vengeance; e&s;pecially that late un|heard of Barbarity committed upon the Town of <HI>Deerfield;</HI> which wrought &s;o generally on the hearts of our People, that our Forces came out with that Unanimity of Spirit, both among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and our Salvages, that we had not, nor needed a Pre&s;s'd Man among them. The Colonel al&s;o telling them, That if ever hereafter any of our Frontiers Ea&s;t or We&s;t were Mo|le&s;ted by them, as formerly, that he would (if God &s;pared his Life,) and they might depend upon it, Return upon them with a thou&s;and of his Salvages, if he wanted them, all Volunteers, with our Whale-boats, and would pur|&s;ue them to the la&s;t Extremity.

<P>After this, they concluded what &s;hould be next done; which was, that the Ships &s;hould &s;tay &s;ome Days longer at <HI>Port Royal Gut,</HI> and then go over to Mount <HI>De&s;art</HI> Harbour, and there &s;tay till Col <HI>Church</HI> with his Tran&s;ports came to them. Being all ready, the Colonel with his Tran&s;ports &amp; Forces went up the Bay to <HI>Signecto,</HI> where they needed not a Pilot, being &s;everal of them well acquainted there: (and had nor met with &s;o many difficulties at <HI>Menis,</HI> had it not been that their Pilot deceiv'd them; who knew nothing of the matter, kept out of the way and Landed not with them, &amp;c.) And coming to <HI>Signecto,</HI> the Enemy were all in Arms ready to receive them, Col. <HI>Church</HI> Landing his Men; the Commander of the Enemy waving his Sword over his head, bid a Challange to them: The Colonel ordering his two Wings to March up a-pace, and come upon the backs of the Enemy, him&s;elf being in the Center, and the Enemy knowing him, (having been there before) Shot chiefly at him; (but thro' Gods goodne&s;s received no harm, neither had he one Man kill'd, nor but two &s;lightly wounded) and then ran all away into the Woods, and left their Town with nothing in it; having had timely Notice of our Forces, had carryed all away out of the reach of our Army; for Col. <HI>Church</HI> while there with part of his Forces Ranged the Woods, but to no purpo&s;e: Then returning to the Town, did them what &s;poil he could; ac|cording to his In&s;tructions, and &s;o drew off, and made the be&s;t of their way for <HI>Pa&s;|&s;amequado,</HI> (and going in) in a great Fog, one of their Tran&s;ports ran upon a Rock, but was &s;oon got off again. Then Col. <HI>Church</HI> with &s;ome of his Forces embark'd in their Whale-boats, and went among&s;t the I&s;lands, with an intent to go to <HI>Sharkee's</HI> where they had de&s;troyed the Fi&s;h; but ob&s;erving a Springgy place in a Cove, went on Shore to get &s;ome Water to drink, it being a Sandy beach, they e&s;py'd Tracks, the Colonel pre&s;ently ordered his Men to &s;catter, and make a &s;earch; &s;oon found <HI>De Bo|i&s;&s;es</HI> Wife, who had formerly been Col. <HI>Church's</HI> Pri&s;oner, and carried to <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> but returned, who &s;eemed to be very glad to &s;ee him: She had with her two Sons that were near Men grown; the Colonel ordering them a part, Examined the Woman fir&s;t, who gave him this account following, That &s;he had lived there-abouts ever &s;ince the Fleet went by, and that &s;he had never &s;een but two <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ince, who came in a Cando from <HI>Norrigiwock;</HI> who ask'd her, what made her to be there alone? She told them; She had not &s;een a <HI>French</HI> Maninor an <HI>Indian</HI> except tho&s;e two &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships went by. Then the <HI>Indians</HI> told her there was not one <HI>Indian</HI> left except tho&s;e two, who belong to the Gut of <HI>Cancer,</HI> on this &s;ide of <HI>Canada:</HI> for the Fryers coming down with the <HI>Indians</HI> to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Gordans,</HI> and finding the French-men &s;lain, and their Hair &s;poiled, being Scalp'd, put them into a great Con&s;ternation; and the Fryerstold them it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to live there abouts, for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> with their W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

Whereupon they all agreed to go away; which they did, and left their Ruff hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, and Corn behind them, and went all, except tho&s;e two for <HI>Canada.</HI> Al&s;o her Sons giving the &s;ame Intelligence, &s;o we had no rea&s;on to think but that it was true. Col. <HI>Church</HI> having done what he could there, Embark'd on board the Tran&s;ports and went to Mount <HI>De&s;art,</HI> where he ex|pected to have met with the Ships from <HI>Port Royal Gut;</HI> and going into the Harbour at Mount <HI>De&s;art,</HI> found no Ships there, but a Runlet rid off by a line in the Harbour, which he ordered to be taken up, and opening of it found a Letter, which gave him an account that the Ships were gone home for <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Then he proceeded &amp; went to <HI>Penob&s;cot;</HI> where being come, made diligent &s;earch in tho&s;e Parts for the Enemy, but could not find or make any di&s;covery of them, or that any had been there &s;ince he left tho&s;e Parts, which caus'd him to believe what <HI>De Boi&s;&s;es</HI> Wife had told him was true. (I will only by the way ju&s;t give a hint of what we heard &s;ince of the Effects of this Expedition, &amp; then proceed.) [Fir&s;t, That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces that went next to <HI>Norrigiwock</HI> found that the Enemy was gone, &amp; had left their Ruff hou&s;hold-&s;tuff and Corn behind them; al&s;o not long after this Expedition, there were &s;everal Gentlemen &s;ent down from <HI>Canada</HI> to concert with our Governour about the &s;ettling of a Cartile for the Exchange of Pri&s;oners; and that the Governour of <HI>Canada</HI> has never &s;ince &s;eet down any Army upon our Frontiers (as I know of) except &s;ome times a Scout of <HI>In|dians</HI> to take &s;ome Pri&s;oners, that he might be informed of our State, and what we were acting <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and always took care that the Pri&s;oners &s;o taken &s;hould be Civily Treated, and &s;afely Returned, as I have been informed; that &s;ome of the Pri&s;oners that were taken gave an account; &s;o that we have great cau&s;e to believe that the Me&s;&s;age Col. <HI>Church</HI> &s;ent by the two <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen from <HI>Menis</HI> to the Governour of <HI>Port Royal</HI> took Effect, and was a means to bring Peace in our borders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>] Then Col. <HI>Church</HI> with his Forces embark'd on board the Tran&s;ports, and went to <HI>Ca&s;es Bay,</HI> where they met with Capt. <HI>Galop</HI> in a Ve&s;&s;el from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> who had brought Col <HI>Church</HI> further Or|ders; which was to &s;end &s;ome of his Forces up to <HI>Norrigiwock</HI> in pur&s;uit of the Enemy; but he being &s;en&s;ible that the Enemy were gone from thence, and that his Souldiers were much wore-out &amp; fategu'd in the hard Service they had already done, &amp; wanted to get home, call'd a Council, and agreed all to go home, which accordingly they did. To Conclude this Expedition, I will ju&s;t give a hint of &s;ome treatment Col. <HI>Church</HI> had before &amp; after he came home: for all his great Expences, Fategues &amp; Hard&s;hips in and about this Expedition, <HI>(viz)</HI> He received of his Excellency <HI>Fifteen Pounds</HI> as an earne&s;t Peny towards Rai&s;ing of Volunteers; and when he came to receive his Debenture for his Colonels Pay, there was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 4 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> due to him; and as for his Captains Pay, &amp; Man <HI>Jack</HI> he has never received any thing as yet. Al&s;o after he came home &s;ome ill mind|ed Per&s;ons did their endeavour to have taken away his Life, for that there was &s;ome of the <HI>French</HI> Enemy Kill'd this Expedition: but his Excellency the Governour, the Honourable Council and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives &s;aw cau&s;e to Clear him, and gave him Thanks for his good Service done.</P>
