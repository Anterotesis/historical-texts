<P>_IF any enquire into the Rea&s;ons of this Publication; the Importunity of &s;ome Friends, and the Judgment of others, together with &s;ome De&s;ire to do good, are the general Arguments of a modern Pre|face: And the Author hopes he has &s;ome Right to this common and u&s;eful Train of Thoughts.</P>
<P>The Sermons are Plain, &amp; adapted to a popular Audience.

<Q><BIBL><HI>PHILIP. iii. 21.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Who &s;hall change our vile body, that it may be fa&s;hioned like unto his glorious body.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THe Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in the Chapter open before us, after &s;ome Precepts laid down, concludes with Two Motives to per&s;wade Men to the Practice of them: And the&s;e are, the <HI>Coming of</HI> CHRIST, in the Ver&s;e preceeding my Text; and the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Saints</HI> now read unto you. Both of them are very &s;olemn and &s;ublime Thoughts: But it is only the latter which comes immediately with in the Compa&s;s of our pre&s;ent Meditation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Dead,</HI> and, which is much the &s;ame thing, the <HI>Transformation of the&s;e found alive</HI> at the coming of CHRIST, are very clearly revealed in the New Te&s;tament, e&s;pecially by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul.</HI> But the Glory of a Believer's Rai&s;ed Body is not nor indeed can it be any where more &s;ully expre&s;s'd, than in the Words under our immediate View. <HI>Who &s;hall change our vile body, that it may be fa&s;hioned like unto his glorious body.</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle tells us, Our Bodies are now <HI>vile;</HI> our vile Bodies &s;hall be <HI>changed;</HI> it is our Lord JESUS CHRIST <HI>who</HI> &s;hall change them; and they &s;hall be <HI>fa&s;hion'd like unto his glorious body.</HI> How much is crowded into a few Words! how emphatical are they! how copious! how &s;ublime! How amply do they fill the Mind, and Exhau&s;t, the Imagination, in&s;pire our Faith, and awaken our Joy?</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003510_0005_0FF8540B39FCAE48" MS="y">
In handling the&s;e Words, I &s;hall only have Time to &s;peak to Three of the Four Articles (or if you plea&s;e, <HI>Doctrines</HI>) which you &s;ee are plainly contained in them.</P>
<P N="1">I <HI>The&s;e Bodies of ours, in their Pre&s;ent State, are</HI> VILE BODIES <HI>Who &s;hall change our vile bodies?</HI> Shall we here let our Thoughts loo&s;e upon a few Particulars, which will render it plain, and humble us with the &s;ad Conviction. The&s;e Bodies, of who&s;e Beauty and Vigour we are &s;o apt to boa&s;t, alas, they are vile Bodies.</P>
<P N="1">1. Their <HI>Original</HI> is mean and de&s;picable. In the Sen&s;e of the <HI>Greek</HI> Text, our Body was vile, even in the Purity of its fir&s;t Creation The Word which we tran&s;late <HI>vile,</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign">: The Body of our <HI>Humility.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>humble</HI> Body. It carries <HI>Humiliation</HI> even in its Origin and Con&s;titution. It comes from <HI>Humus;</HI> the <HI>moi&s;t Ground;</HI> The <HI>Clay,</HI> the <HI>low Earth.</HI> The Fir&s;t Principle of <HI>Humane,</HI> is <HI>Humus.</HI> Humiliation and Vilene&s;s is thus entail'd upon our Body, even from the primitive Materials out of which it was framed. Even <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradi&s;e and Innocence, might in this &s;acred &s;en&s;e, have own'd a Vile Body.</P>
<P>And now, Let the Proud Creature look down to the Earth, &amp; view the Du&s;t from which he &s;prung, &amp; then confe&s;s his Body Vile. <HI>And the Lord God formed man out of the du&s;t of the ground</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> ii. 7.</NOTE> Out of the Clay was this living Frame fa&s;hioned; here it had its humble Ori|ginal; and from this abject Earth, did it ari&s;e and &s;hoot up, thus cu|rious in its Form and Con&s;titution. This beautecus Arrangement of finer Du&s;t, was taken from the common Glebe, into which it mu&s;t quickly fall, and re&s;olve again. The Limbs which now &s;hew the exacte&s;t Symmetry and Proportion, the Pul&s;es which beat with the &s;tronge&s;t Energy and Life, and the A&s;pect that is flu&s;h'd with Health and Beauty, owe all their Exi&s;tance to the &s;ame Clods of Earth which harbour our Brethren, the Worms: The Worms, which wait to Fea&s;t upon our moulding Carca&s;e; and riot in our wa&s;ting Fle&s;h. The Body <HI>is of the Earth, earthy: Du&s;t it is, and to Du&s;t it &s;hall return.</HI> Let us reflect thus, &amp; then confe&s;s, This VILE BODY.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a <HI>&s;inful</HI> Body, and therefore a vile Body. It has in it a Body of Death; and no wonder it looks gha&s;tly, and loath&s;ome, and vile. All its Appetites are vitiated, and di&s;order'd, and it leads the Soul about like a Malefactor in Chains. The Spirit which God <HI>in|fu&s;es,</HI> is depraved and polluted by it: and Original Sin is <HI>communi|cated</HI> thro' the Veins of the guilty Parent. The &s;everal <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> of the Body, prove &s;o many Traitors to the nobler Faculties of the Mind, and continually captivate and deba&s;e it. How many Sins enter at the <HI>Eyes?</HI> and how many idle Ideas pa&s;s in at the <HI>Ears, forever open</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="003510_0006_0FF853E126DDE7C8">to the Vanity of empty and corrupted Air. The Luxuries of the <HI>Palate</HI> debauch the en&s;laved Mortal, and drag him on to Exce&s;s and Intemperance. He wanders among &s;en&s;ible Appearances, and for gets &s;piritual and divine Reallities. He is hardly brought to con&s;i|der, that the <HI>things which are SEEN are temporal, but the things, which are not &s;een are eternal.</HI> Is not the Body, that thus abu&s;es the Soul, the Rational principle within, a vile Body? The Body, the beauti|ful Workman&s;hip of an Alwi&s;e Artificer, how is it &s;unk beneath the Level of the brutal World, by its Sin again&s;t God? O <HI>wretched that we are! who &s;hall deliver us from the Body of this Death?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Our Body is a weak, <HI>infirm</HI> Body, and therefore a vile Body. It is a feeble Hou&s;e of Clay, that totters to every Bla&s;t. Di&s;ea&s;e and Mortality lurk in every Member, and Vein, and Mu&s;cle. It is li|able to Contagions and Di&s;tempers of all Sorts. They March &s;ilent and un&s;een, in the fine Air about us. They lie brooding in their Venom, thro' all the Fluids within: Latent De&s;truction! Death in Ambu&s;cade! A thou&s;and different Fevers &s;tand ready to &s;eize this Body; to torment it, and to burn away its Life: To lick up the finer Spirts, and &s;hap the Vital Cord. It may be at once <HI>blinded</HI> by a Defluxion of Rheum, fetter'd with the Tortures of the <HI>Gout,</HI> and broken in the Agonies of the <HI>Stone:</HI> Like <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> in the Phili&s;tian Pri&s;on-hou&s;e, at the &s;ame Time <HI>blinded,</HI> and <HI>&s;hackled,</HI> and <HI>grinding.</HI> Every Nerve about us, is capable of Pains too great for us to bear, too &s;trong for us to re&s;i&s;t, and too &s;ubtil for us to e&s;cape. The Strength of the mo&s;t athlerick Body, is &s;till on the Wing; may fly away &s;uddenly; will do it &s;peedily; and mu&s;t at la&s;t wholly leave it. The Beauty of the mo&s;t amiable Body, is every Day ha&s;ting to fade, and go out in ob&s;cure Darkne&s;s. Our daily eating and drinking, proclaim a feeble Body, that would faint and die if the&s;e were o|mitted. Every Time we &s;et down to a Table, or take a Cup in our Hand, we confe&s;s we are Creatures that need con&s;tant Support and Nouri&s;hment. When we lie down to the nece&s;&s;ary Sleep of the Night, we own the Sleep of the Night mu&s;t relieve us a little from the long Slumber of the Grave. Every Breath we draw, in&s;inuares, in a &s;ilent Whi&s;per, our Frailty, our Dependance on God, and our &s;horn Continuance: It warns us that our <HI>Life is Wind.</HI>&mdash;So Weak is out Body, that it take away much of our Thought from our Souls, to contrive for its Life, and Health, and Su&s;t, nance.&mdash;Let us look now upon the brittle Frame, and exclaim, O the vile Body!</P>
<P N="4">4. It is a <HI>dying</HI> Body, &amp; therefore a vile Body. Here our Bodies now &s;tand, perhaps flouri&s;hing in all the Pride and Bloom of Youth: Strong our Sinews; moi&s;t our Bones; active and &s;upple our Jomes; our Pul&s;es beating with Vigour, and our Heares leaping with a Pro|fu&s;ion of Life and Energy. But oh! Vaim Appearance and gaudy Dream! Surely every Man at his be&s;t E&s;tate, is altogether Vanity. He walks in a vain Show; he glitter, with delu&s;ive Colours; he &s;pends his Years as an Idle Tale. What avails it, that he is now
<PB N="4" REF="003510_0007_0FF8540D8226B090">hardy and robu&s;t, who mu&s;t quickly pant upon a Death-bed. What avails it, that his Limbs are &s;prightly in their ea&s;y Motions, which mu&s;t quickly &s;tretch in the dying Agony. The Lips now flu&s;h'd with a Ro&s;ey Colour, will anon quiver and turn pale. The Eyes that roll with a &s;parkling Vivacity, will fix in a gha&s;tly Horror. The mo&s;t mu&s;ical Voice will be &s;top'd; and the tuneful Breath fly away. The Face where Beauty now triumphs, will appear cold, and wan, and di&s;mal, rifled by the Hand of Death. A Cold Sweat will chill the Body; a hoar&s;e Rattling will fill the Throat; the Heart will heave with Pain and Labour, and the Lungs catch for Breath, but ga&s;p in vain. Our Friends &s;tand in Tears about our Bed: They weep; but they cannot help us. The very Water with which they would cool and moi&s;ten our pearched Mouths, we receive with a hol|low Groan, Anon we give a Ga&s;p, and they &s;hriek out in Di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>'Oh! He's gone,&mdash;He's dead!'</HI> The Body in that In&s;tant &s;tretches on the Sheets, an awful Corp&s;e. This is the End of our Body for this World: Pronounce now; Is it not a Vile Body? But this brings me to the la&s;t Article.</P>
<P N="5">5. Our Body will quickly be a <HI>dead</HI> Body, and this proclaims it a vile Body. The Silks and &s;oft Linnen which now fold and adorn the&s;e Bodies, mu&s;t be changed for a winding Sheet. The Applau&s;e and Complement which now flatter us, are not heard in the Retire|ments of the Grave, to di&s;turb its aweful Silence: Nor &s;hall Re|proaches and Revilings break in upon our Re&s;t there. Our plea&s;ant Habitations will be left for others, while we have no Apartment left us, but a Coffin, or a Tomb at mo&s;t. We &s;hall for&s;ake our Di&s;hes and our Tables; and our &s;elves become Food for the crawling Vermin of the Du&s;t. How quickly &s;hall we ha&s;ten to Clay and A&s;hes, in the &s;olitary, and dark, and cold Grave?</P>
<P>In a few Years, the mo&s;t beautious, or learned, or pious Head will grin a hideous Skull. Our broken Coffins will &s;how nothing but black Bones, and black Mould, and Worms &amp; Filth. The Places that know us &s;hall know us no more. The per&s;ons who were mo&s;t intimate in our Acquaintance; who &s;ooth'd us with their Vi&s;its, or care&s;s'd us in their Bo&s;oms, will now forget us. When they &s;hall perhaps enter our Tombs and take up our Bones in their Hand, they'll not &s;u&s;pect the frightful Carca&s;e to be Ours, &s;ave by the Letters on the broken Coffin, or the In&s;cription on the mouldring Monument.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Man giveth up the Gho&s;t, and where is he?</HI> What be|comes of the Dream of Worldly Happine&s;s? Where are the Hou&s;es, and the Coffers? The Great Name, the loud Applau&s;e, and the Brutal Plea&s;ure? His Riches are left to others: And to whom he knows not; whether a Wi&s;e Man or a Fool. He for&s;akes his nu|merous Hou&s;es, and is confined to a narrow Coffin, in a lonely Vault.
<PB N="5" REF="003510_0008_0FF853E3814410F0">Out of all his Lands he retains but a few Foot of Earth to co|ver him from the Sight. His boa&s;ted Name is forgot among the living, and &s;carce once in an Age ca&s;ually read upon his Grave-&s;tone. <HI>His Breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Earth, in that very Day his Thoughts peri&s;h.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xlvi. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Spirit is given up; and &s;ee the Body drops down, pale, and &s;tiff, and cold. The Eyes are fixt; the Teeth are &s;et; the Breath is fled. Is this the Face we once gaz'd upon with &s;o much Plea&s;ure? Are the&s;e the Cheeks that glow'd &s;o fre&s;h, and bloom'd &s;o lovely? Are the&s;e the Lips that &s;mil'd &s;o graceful, and pour'd out &s;uch a gliding Stream of Eloquence and Mu&s;ick? Where's the tuneful Voice that once held the li&s;tening Ear, and rais'd the attentive Eye? Where are the proportioned Limbs, the &s;upple Joints, the vigorous Pul&s;es, the beating Heart, the working Brain, and the breathing Brea&s;t? Lo, the Body is laid in the Du&s;t, and the Worms cover in. Polluted Vermine crawl over every Part of the elegant Form, and the beautious Face. It is folded in a winding Sheet, it is nailed in a black Coffin, and it is depo&s;ited in a &s;ilent Vault, amid&s;t Shades and Solitude. The Skin breaks and moulders away; the Fle&s;h drops in Du&s;t from the Bones; the Bones are covered with black Mould, and Worms twi&s;t a|bout them. The Coffins break, and the Graves &s;ink in, and the di&s;jointed Skelliton &s;trows the lonely Vault. This &s;hapely Fabrick mu&s;t leave its Ruins among the Graves; lie neglected and for|got; moulder away without a Name, and &s;catter among the E|lements. 'And were the&s;e Bones once living like ours? and mu&s;t ours be as they'? This hideous Skull, the frightful Jaw fallen, and the black Teeth naked to the Eye, was it once a thinking Frame, covered with a beautcous Skin? Strange Al|teration made by Death! And are not our Burying-Grounds full of &s;uch Spectacles? What do they but illu&s;trate and con|firm the Doctrine? Methinks every Grave, with open Mouth, preaches upon my Text, <HI>This Vile Body.</HI> O, Vile Body! under what infarmous! Di&s;honours of Loath&s;omene&s;s and Corruption art thou? Thou mu&s;t be laid away in the du&s;ty Galleries of the Grave, the gloomy Chambers of Death, unregarded and unknown; lo&s;t in deep Retirement, and awful Silence. O Vile Body!</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;een with what Propriety Vilene&s;s belongs to the&s;e Bodies. How &s;uitable and emphatical the degrading Epi|thet? Let us here pau&s;e, and improve, and &s;et Limits to the De&s;cription.</P>
<P>Is this Body &s;o Vile and Wretched? <HI>How vain and fooli&s;h is it to be Proud of our Body <GAP DESC="foreign">:

No more let airy Fa&s;hions and loo&s;er Modes of Dre&s;s expo&s;e the Body. Nor let it be lo&s;t in the &s;tudied Di&s;pro|portions of an ambitious Garb.

<P>But let us &s;et Limits to the Exclamation, and not carry it too far. No; our Bodies, vile as they are, are to be honoured and re&s;pected by us. They are the wonderful Production of Omnipotence, the curious Workman&s;hip of an alwi&s;e Artificer.

II. <HI>The&s;e vile Bodies of ours &s;hall be</HI> CHANGED.

See in the I&s;t Epi&s;t. Cor. xv. Chap. where the Apo&s;tle treats this Subject at large, ver. 51, 52. <HI>Behold I &s;hew you a my&s;tery; we &s;hall not all &s;heep, but we &s;hall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an Eye, at the la&s;t Trumpet, (for the Trumpot &s;hall &s;ound) and the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed incorruptable, and we &s;hall be changed.</HI> So that in the End, there will be very little Difference between the dead Believers, and tho&s;e whom our Lord finds alive at his coming.

<P N="1">1. This vile Body &s;hall be changed from the STATE <HI>of</HI> DEATH.

<P N="1">1.

Saul</HI> was &s;truck blind, dazled with the un&s;ufferable Blaze, that ru&s;h'd in a Tempe&s;t upon his Eyes, from the Body of the Son of GOD. <HI>John</HI> beheld him, with his Face &s;hining like the Sun in its meridian Flame, and his Body beam|ing in an an&s;werable Glory.

They &s;hall put on a &s;hining Form; &s;hoot like a Flame from the Grave, and glitter like a Ray of Light up the Ether. Dan. xii. 3. <HI>They that be wi&s;e, &s;hall &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the Firmament, and they which turn many to Rightcou&s;ne&s;s, as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It implies that our Bodies &s;hall be <HI>immortal.</HI> CHRIST's Body is immortal; <HI>Being rai&s;ed from the Dead, he dieth no more,</HI> Rev. vi. 9.

<P>_THE main Subject which our Lord JESUS CHRIST in&s;i&s;ted on in the con&s;tant Cour&s;e of his Mini&s;try, was, the Nece&s;&s;ity of Conver&s;ion and the New Birth. When <HI>Nicodemus</HI> came to conver&s;e with him, he took the Fir&s;t Opportunity to &s;urprize the Honoura|ble <HI>Rabbi</HI> with this mo&s;t important Doctrine: <HI>Except a man be born again he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of</HI> GOD, Joh. iii. 3. And here in my Text, when the ambitious Di&s;ciples came to him to determine a Di&s;pute which they had been no doubt warmly en|gaged in; <HI>Which of them &s;hould be the greate&s;t in the Kingdom of Hea|ven?</HI> Nay, &s;ays our Lord, Not too Fa&s;t: <HI>Except ye be converted, and become as little Children,</HI> ye &s;hall &s;o much as <HI>enter in</HI> there at all. Pride, and Strife, and Emulations, are no Preparatives for that World. Nor the Kingdom of Grace below, nor the Kingdom of Glory above, is to be enter'd with this unmortified, a&s;piring Temper. Conver&s;ion, Humility, and a new Life, mu&s;t make us meet for that Inheritance in Light. CHRIST him&s;elf has de|termined this Matter, and it therefore comes to us with all Au|thority and Conviction. Let us then attend earne&s;tly to the Il|lu&s;tration and Application of the Words.</P>

<P>Man was at fir&s;t created holy and happy in the Enjoyment of GOD. The Soul of <HI>Adam</HI> was filled with Thoughts of GOD, and love to him. The Glory of GOD was his. End in all that he did. The Sen&s;e of GOD, Love to GOD, and Satisfaction in the Will of GOD, made up the Happine&s;s of <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradi&s;e. The Soul was &s;atisfied and crowded with the Enjoyment of the Infinite Being; and a Sen&s;e of his Glories, and his Love.</P>
<P>Well. But no &s;ooner did <HI>Adam</HI> &s;in, and renounce this Happi|ne&s;s, than GOD for&s;ook him, and he was left de&s;titute and empty. That Soul that was once filled full of GOD, has now in it a va&s;t Ca&s;m. We feel indeed our want of Happine&s;s: But our dark Minds know not where to find it. The De&s;ire remains: but the Satisfaction is lo&s;t and gone. Our Souls feel &s;omething want|ing. There's a va&s;t Hollow there without any thing to fill it up. It is con&s;tantly craving, <HI>Give, Give.</HI> That's the Rea&s;on that Men are never perfectly ea&s;y and at Re&s;t. They are forever pur&s;uing that Happine&s;s which they con&s;tantly mi&s;s of. GOD is gone, and Happine&s;s with Him: and they try to fill up the empty Space, with every thing they can lay their Hands on. Riches, and Ho|nours, and Sen&s;ual Plea&s;ures, the&s;e they fancy will make them happy. They try; and try again; and repeat their Tryal: But they &s;till meet a Di&s;appointment. They think; If ever I obtain &s;uch a thing I &s;hall be &s;atisfied. If ever I get into &s;uch Circum|&s;tances, I &s;hall &s;et down contented. They obtain what they de|&s;ire,
<PB N="3" REF="003510_0020_0FF853F443A8F748">and are ju&s;t where they were before. Then they put off the Point of Happine&s;s a little further, and &s;till think on &s;ome Tempo|ral Good which they have not yet enjoyed. If they obtain this too, they are &s;till di&s;appointed. Thus they go on from one De|ceit to another, till Death overtakes them, before they have tryed their la&s;t Project. This has been the Ca&s;e of all Mankind from <HI>Adam</HI> until now: Nor will Men take Warning after all. All pa&s;t Examples, and all their own Experience to this Moment, will make no la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ion on them. They have lo&s;t Happine&s;s in GOD: they wander from Creature to Creature in Pur&s;uit of it. Madne&s;s is in their Hearts while they live; and after that they go down un|to the Dead. I am not at all wandering from my Text, in the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, but making clear the Way to it.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ion then lies here. The Man as he is pur&s;uing Happi|ne&s;s in Creatures, is &s;top'd &s;hort and convinced that the&s;e will not do. GOD gives him a New Sight of things. He &s;ees an End of all Perfection below GOD. He &s;ees he is undone every where el&s;e. Now his Will is renewed. He <HI>turns about:</HI> (THAT'S CONVERSION) he TURNS ABOUT to GOD, and from this Time &s;eeks all Happine&s;s in Him alone. He &s;ays, <HI>Who &s;hall &s;hew me any Good?</HI> and he replies, <HI>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon me. Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? and there is none upon Earth that I de&s;ive be&s;ides Thee.</HI> For ever after this Turn of Soul, the Man is &s;et upon plea&s;ing GOD: upon yielding to the Will of GOD: upon approving him&s;elf in the Sight of GOD. He never &s;eeks his Happine&s;s in the Creature any more. He may indeed, under the Power of Temptation, ca&s;t a wi&s;hing Look at them. But he recalls it in a Moment. He never can re&s;t ca&s;y one Moment &s;hort of the Favour of GOD. Like the Needle touch'd by the Magnet, &s;till pointing Northward. When it is &s;haken indeed, and to&s;t a|bout, it trembles, it wavers, it vibrates, it varies a Point this way and that, but it never fixes but right North again. So a Soul thus touched by the SPIRIT of GOD, may be to&s;t by Temptati|ons, and the Hurries of the World, and look this Way and that among the Creatures, till the Violence of the Shock is over, but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> never fixes; never re&s;ts, till be points full and &s;teady to GOD again. This &s;hort Paragraph is, I think, a full and clear Account of Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>We all are &s;eeking Happine&s;s. Every Natural Man &s;eeks for it &s;omewhere below GOD. Conver&s;ion is, The Man &s;eeing he is infinitely wrong, <HI>turns about</HI> to GOD again to &s;eek his whole Satisfaction there. I hope I have now &s;aid enough in a few Words to explain the Matter, and &s;hew what Conver&s;ion is. Before we proceed to the next Head, we may make one or two &s;olemn and affecting Inferences.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="003510_0021_0FF8541DF3E20F08">
1. From what we have heard, we perceive that <HI>Conver&s;ion is out of our Power.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible for us to convert our &s;elves; or for all the Angels in Heaven to do it for us. To convince you of this, Let the Natural Man make the Experiment. Try this Mo|ment. Try and &s;ee whither you can bring your Hearts to this, to rehounce all Happine&s;s in every thing but the Favour of GOD; to let GOD order for you; to have no Will of your own; to be &s;wallow'd up, and ravi&s;h'd with his Will, whatever it is. Can you forego every Creature-Comfort? Can you leave this World, and all the Delights of it, to go to a World where you will have none of them, but the Love of GOD will &s;wallow you up? The&s;e things are &s;o di&s;tant from an unrenewed Heart, that they look like wild Paradoves to it. The Man finds he can't bring his Heart to this; and he thinks no Body ever could. And yet, there is not a Good Man upon Earth, but knows a little what this means. He knows a little what it is to love GOD; to have his Happine&s;s in GOD; to exult that the Will of GOD is done. Not a Good Man upon Earth, but would gladly leave all the Delights of Life, only to be made perfectly holy. Nay, all he fears in Death is, le&s;t it &s;hould not convey him to a World of perfect Holine&s;s. Could he be &s;ure con&s;ummate Holine&s;s would be to him the immediate Con&s;equent of Death, he'd die chearfully; without a Struggle or a Groan. Seeing then that Conver&s;ion is not in our own Power, let us &s;eek to GOD for it. Sen&s;ible, and amazed at our own Incapacity, let us go to GOD, and take to our &s;elves Words and &s;ay with repenting <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Jer. xxxi. 18. <HI>Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned; for thou art the Lord my</HI> GOD. Be &s;en&s;i|ble of the &s;inful Nature which &s;till carries us away from him. Be &s;en&s;ible of that fir&s;t Sin, by which we departed from him, and pray, P&s;al. lxxx. 19. <HI>Turn us again, O Lord</HI> GOD <HI>of Ho&s;ts, and cau&s;e thy Face to &s;hine and we &s;hall he &s;aved.</HI> To &s;ee our own Im|potency is the fir&s;t Step towards Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. From what we have heard we learn <HI>our Nece&s;&s;ity of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. We can't turn again to GOD without Him. No man can come to the Father but by Him. The Enmity between GOD and us is irreconcilable but by CHRIST. Out of him GOD is a con&s;uming Fire. We may indeed feel the Want of Happine&s;s, but we &s;hould never dare to go to GOD for it. He would be our Enemy, and we &s;hould hate him for it. <HI>Fal&s;e Notions</HI> of the Di|vine Ju&s;tice and Mercy could never bring us truly to him: And <HI>true ones</HI> would only drive us farther from Him. So that &s;et CHRIST a&s;ide, and there can be no Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. We Infer <HI>the Honours of the</HI> HOLY GHOST. He is the Agent who performs this Work. One Rea&s;on that Men fall Short of this &s;aving Change, is the not acknowledging him as they ought. Did men regard the Operation of the Holy SPIRIT more, there would be more frequent Converts. Men are apt to tru&s;t to
<PB N="5" REF="003510_0022_0FF853F5D129E7D8" MS="y">their own Strength when they &s;et about the Work of Conver&s;ion. They rob the Spirit of GOD of his Glory, and &s;o it all comes to nothing. He it is who makes this great Change in men. He mu&s;t be the Almighty GOD then: and we &s;hould honour him as &s;o.</P>
<P N="4">4. You &s;ee <HI>how many mi&s;take in their Notions of Conver&s;ion.</HI> Some think that to be converted is only to profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion. They fancy that to turn from Heatheni&s;m to Chri&s;tianity is all that is implied in it. To talk of a Bapti&s;ed Per&s;on's being af|terward converted they think is Cant and Super&s;tition. This is the modern (I wi&s;h I could not add, the obtaining and fa&s;hionable) Scheme. If we &s;peak of our being <HI>Converted,</HI> they ask, why what were you before? <HI>Jews,</HI> or <HI>Turks,</HI> or <HI>Heathen?</HI> Alas, the fatal Mi&s;take! We are all undone in our Natural State, unle&s;s we know what Conver&s;ion means. We are all naturally departing from GOD, and &s;eeking Happine&s;s in &s;omething below him. If ever we are happy then, it mu&s;t be by our &s;topping here, and turn|ing about to him. Conver&s;ion does not con&s;i&s;t, in embracing a new Sect, or Party: in Bapti&s;m, or Approach to the Lord's Ta|ble; or any external Privilege, or Advantage, or Alteration. No; it con&s;i&s;ts in turning from the Creature to GOD.</P>
<P N="5">5. From what we have heard, we learn the Propriety of the Expre&s;&s;ion in the Text, Except ye <HI>become as Little Children.</HI> Con|ver&s;ion implies &s;uch a Change as will bring us to begin our Life anew. We mu&s;t become as Little Children: mode&s;t, unambitious, teachable as they. Like them, we mu&s;t begin to live again: be|gin another kind of Life: pur&s;ue a quite different End, by quite different Mea&s;ures. Like a weaned Child, mu&s;t be weaned from Creatures, and the things we were formerly fond of. But I would not enlarge here. I proceed to the Second thing propo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;hew <HI>what we are to under&s;tand by the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> &s;poken of in the Text. <HI>Except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye &s;hall not enter into the KINGDOM</HI> OF <HI>HEAVEN.</HI> I &s;hall not be long in explaining this Phra&s;e. The <HI>Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom of</HI> GOD, are principally u&s;ed in the Evangeli&s;ts for the State of the Go&s;pel in This World; or the Rewards of it in the Future. Sometimes it means the Kingdom of Grace; and &s;ometimes the Kingdom of Glory. And I &s;uppo&s;e that tho' the Text may ultimately refer to the Latter, yet it takes in the former al&s;o. And therefore we &s;hall con&s;ider them both in our Handling the Third Propo&s;ition: Which is this.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Except we be converted and become as little Children, we &s;hall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Without this we cannot enter into the <HI>Kingdom of Grace.</HI> God cannot receive us as his Favourites even in This World, till
<PB N="6" REF="003510_0023_0FF8542026155808" MS="y">we have had this Change pa&s;&s;ed upon us. He will take no Delight in us, while we openly neglect him, and &s;et up Self and Creatures in his Throne. We may indeed belong to his Kingdom of <HI>Mercy,</HI> and he may have De&s;igns for our Salvation before our Conver&s;ion: But we are by no means Subjects in this Kingdom of <HI>Grace</HI> before this. By no means intitled to his Special Favours, and the Ob|jects of his peculiar Delight.</P>
<P>We may indeed belong to the Vi&s;ible Kingdom of CHRIST in the World, and not be &s;avingly Converted. We may be Members of his Church here, and eat and drink in his Pre&s;ence, and yet he know nothing of us. But here too, in order to our being worthy Gue&s;ts at this &s;acred Fea&s;t, Conver&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary. But</P>
<P N="2">2. Without this Conver&s;ion be&s;ure we cannot enter into the <HI>Kingdom of Glory.</HI> Rev. xxi. 27. <HI>There &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into it, any thing that defileth, neither what&s;oever worketh abomination.</HI> And not only has GOD <HI>declared</HI> this, all over his New Te&s;tarnent, but it is impo&s;&s;ible even in the <HI>Nature of the Thing.</HI> The prin|cipal Happine&s;s in the Kingdom of Glory is, in being perfectly conformed to the Will of GOD: And this, we know, is only at|tainable by Conver&s;ion. We entertain ju&s;ter Ideas of Heaven, when we apprehend it as a <HI>State</HI> than a <HI>Place.</HI> There is indeed &s;uch a glorious Place; but we know not where, or what it is. But as to the Temper and Happine&s;s of this Holy World, this every Good Man feels a little of in his own Brea&s;t. What do they do in Heaven? What do they Enjoy there? Truly they prai&s;e GOD; they love GOD; they &s;eek their whole Happi|ne&s;s in GOD; and are perfectly conformed to his Will. And now, how can an Unconverted Man enter that glorious World? His whole Soul is bent upon Self and Creatures; here he termi|nates, and he knows nothing further. Should &s;uch a Soul but once get into the Man&s;ions of Glory, he would be like a Swine in a Golden Palace: He'd be quite out of his Element; and long for the Puddle and the Mire again. Like <HI>Uzziah</HI> with his Lepro|&s;y in the holy place, 2 Chron. xxvi. 20. <HI>And Azariah the chief Prie&s;t, and all the Prie&s;ts looked upon him, and behold he was leprous in his Forehead, and they thru&s;t him out from thence, yea, him&s;elf ha&s;t|ed al&s;o to go out.</HI> So would be the Ca&s;e of the Polluted Soul in the Holy Heavens. Not only would the <HI>Angels,</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;t Spirits drive</HI> him our from among them, but he <HI>him&s;elf</HI> would <HI>ha&s;te</HI> al&s;o to <HI>go out.</HI> What &s;hould he do there? His Soul has no turn to this Sort of Happine&s;s. Unmortified Lu&s;ts, and raging Appe|tites; Pride, and Sen&s;uality, and Self-Will would be a Hell in his own Bo&s;om, amid&s;t all the Glories of Heaven. His whole Nature mu&s;t be changed; he mu&s;t be converted, and begin a New Life, or he could never enter into that ble&s;&s;ed State.
<PB N="7" REF="003510_0024_0FF853FA67A5A880"><HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye &s;hall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured as clearly as I could, to explain and demon&s;trate the Doctrine, and I come now to the Solemn Application.</P>
<P N="1">1. Shall not the Unconverted enter into the Kingdom of Hea|ven, <HI>Where then &s;hall they go?</HI> They mu&s;t go &s;omewhere. They are in Being, and they mu&s;t exi&s;t for ever. <HI>Here</HI> they cannot always live: In a &s;ew Days more they mu&s;t leave this Earth; not &s;uffered to tarry by Rea&s;on of Death. To <HI>Heaven</HI> they can|not go. They have no Part there; nothing to do there; The Voice of CHRIST, like a Flaming Sword, guards the Pa&s;&s;age again&s;t them. <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you, they &s;hall not enter</HI> there. Well then, what will become of them! O fearful, de&s;titute, ruined State! The infallible Word of GOD informs us where the mi&s;erable Creatures mu&s;t take up their Eternal Lodging, Matt. xxv. 46. <HI>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</HI> Mark ix. 43.48. into <HI>the Fire that never &s;hall be quenched: where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</HI> Rev. xiv. 10, 11. <HI>The &s;ame &s;hall drink of the wine of the wrath of</HI> GOD, <HI>which is pour|ed out without mixture, into the cup of his Indignation, and he &s;hall be tormented with Fire and Brim&s;tone, in the pre&s;ence of the holy An|gels, and in the pre&s;ence of the Lamb; and the Smoke of their Tor|ment a&s;oendeth up for ever and ever; and they have no re&s;t day nor night.</HI> He that overcometh, indeed, &s;hall inherit all things: He that is converted and has his Nature changed, &s;hall enter into the World of Glory: <HI>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the a|bominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and &s;orcerers, and ido|laters, and all liars, &s;hall have their Part in the lake which burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone which is the &s;econd Death,</HI> Rev. xxi. 7, 8. See now the Place to which the unconverted mu&s;t go! See the gloomy Landskip of that infernal World! And O, are we not amazed? are we not in Agony, about our e&s;cape from this Ruin? Who can dwell with devouring Fire? who can dwell with e|verla&s;ting Burnings? Is not the Ca&s;e awful and dreadful? And do not our Hearts quiver, and our Souls &s;ink and die within us. Behold, Life and Death &s;et before us: Eternal Life, and Eter|nal Fire; and are they in&s;ignificant Things! O &s;tupid! O mad! if they make no Impre&s;&s;ion upon us. On the one Hand we are informed, <HI>Repent and be converted, and your Sins &s;hall be blotted out;</HI> and <HI>Except ye be converted ye &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into the King|dom of Heaven.</HI> Nay, on the Contrary, we mu&s;t take up our e|ternal Abode in the World of Darkne&s;s, and Fire, and Chains. Ah! mi&s;erable Ca&s;e of Unconverted Men! Who would not fear, who would not fly their Doom? And therefore,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="003510_0025_0FF85421AB11BDD8">
2. From what we have heard, <HI>O let us labour in&s;tantly after &s;aving Conver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Turn ye, Turn ye, why will ye die.</HI> Con&s;ider the matter, and debate it with your own Hearts. Conver&s;ion begins in &s;erious Con&s;ideration. <HI>I thought on my ways, and turned my Feet unto thy Te&s;timonies,</HI> was the good old way, P&s;al. cxix. 59. Let us then go alone, and put the Ca&s;e to our &s;elwes, <Q>Am I con|verted or not? What Happine&s;s am I pur&s;uing; a Happine&s;s in the Creature, or a Happine&s;s in the Enjoyment of GOD? Can I think that the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any Temporal Good can make me Happy? Have I not often made the Experiment al|ready; and have I not as often been di&s;appointed? And why &s;hould I try any more? Is it not high Time for me to <HI>turn about,</HI> and &s;ee if I cannot find that Happine&s;s in GOD, which till now I have in vain &s;ought for in Objects below him?</Q> Propo&s;e the&s;e Que&s;tions to your own Souls, and &s;ee what an&s;wer your Con&s;cience will frame upon them.</P>
<P>Now be convinced that you cannot give this Turn to your &s;elves. Learn to feel and be &s;en&s;ible how atached to Self and Creatures you are. Mourn it and confe&s;s it before GOD: and tell him how undone you are without his Almighty Grace. Plead with Him in Tears and Agony to change your vile Na|ture: to turn you &s;avingly to Him&s;elf. Be importunate, be re&s;t|le&s;s till you find this done for you: Till you find a Soul in|tirely for&s;aking the Creature and pur&s;uing its whole Satisfaction in GOD alone. Till CHRIST appears tran&s;cendently dear and lovely to you; and you can joyfully leave this World to go to His Arms and his Bo&s;om. This divine and &s;aving Turn of Soul, may be given to you, as you are in the U&s;e of the&s;e appointed Means labouring to obtain it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>O Let tho&s;e of us who have been converted, live becoming the Change we are under.</HI> Be thankful, be joyful: thankful to the GOD who has turn'd us, and joyful that we are pa&s;&s;ing to Hea|ven. Let us labour more and more after the Heavenly Temper: Love GOD more; think on him, work for him, long and wi&s;h to be with him. If ever we find a prevailing Fondne&s;s for Crea|tures after this; if ever we find our Wills going to rebel, or our De&s;ires tend to this World; let us immediately check the inordi|nate Affection, and &s;ay, <Q>No, I have renounced the&s;e long ago. I have cho&s;en GOD for my Portion, and his Will for my Law long ago. GOD forbid, that after having e&s;caped the Snare, I &s;hould be again taken and entangled therein. No, No, farewell Creatures: no more &s;hall you tempt me from my true Happi|ne&s;s. Farewell the Riches I once coveted; the Applau&s;e I once gra&s;p'd after; the Plea&s;ures that looked &s;o charming. Farewell Felicity on Earth: and welcome the Will of my GOD: welcome Everla&s;ting Life. Welcome the Good Taings of Earth, which my
<PB N="9" REF="003510_0026_0FF853FC90AA5F68">GOD plea&s;es to give me: But adieu all Thoughts of Happine&s;s in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e. Welcome Afflictions too; the Gifts of my GOD, and the Purcha&s;e of my SAVIOUR? Shall I receive Good at his Hands, and not receive Evil? 'Tis the Cup which my Father gives me, why &s;hould I not drink it! Other Lords have had Dominion over me: But what have I any more to do with Idols?</Q></P>
<P>And while are thus awakening the Piety of our own Souls, how &s;hould we pity a mi&s;erable World about us? Poor Creatures! they know not what this Love to GOD means. They never felt what it was to be re&s;igned to the Will of GOD, and &s;wallowed up in his Love and his Prai&s;es. They are, as we once were, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to Sen&s;e and Creatures; and have no Idea of Conver&s;ion and the New Birth. You may talk them eternally of the&s;e things; but they di&s;cern them not: you had as good go to explain the My&s;tery of Colours to a Man born blind. Ah, Poor Men! how &s;hould we pitty and pray for them: How &s;hould we contrive to &s;hew them their Dan|ger and Mi&s;ery; and labour with them to make their e&s;cape? Re|member, <HI>He that converteth a Sinner from the Error of his Way, &s;hall &s;ave a Soul from Death.</HI> Sure we never need envy them the little Good they po&s;&s;e&s;s: But O how &s;hould we admire the Free Grace which has di&s;tingui&s;hed us from them! There's no Room for boa&s;ting in the Ca&s;e. 'Tis all &s;overeign, and all free: To GOD belongs the Glory; and to us Wonder, and Gratitude, and Humility.</P>
<P>We draw on towards a Conclu&s;ion. And how can we leave off better than with a View of that Heavenly World, &s;poken of in the Text? This then &s;hall be the la&s;t Inference from the whole.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>What a Holy and Happy Place is the Kingdom of Heaven?</HI> There is not one <HI>&s;inful Per&s;on,</HI> not one <HI>&s;inful Frame</HI> in that World. The Spirits of <HI>Ju&s;t men</HI> are <HI>made perfect</HI> before they are admitted there. Tho' the Good Man <HI>here</HI> loves GOD above all, and choo&s;es his Portion in him, yet this gracious Temper is often &s;hock'd and broken by Temptations and Indwelling Sin. But <HI>There</HI> is no Sin, no Corruption, no Tempter. All the Employment, all the Conver|&s;ation, and every Thought is about GOD and his Glories. <HI>Alle|luia, for the Lord GOD omnipotent reigneth;</HI> This is the Language, the Temper, the Work, the Felicity of Heaven. There, they are <HI>filled with all the Fulne&s;s of GOD.</HI> There, <HI>GOD is all in all.</HI> In that happy World, every Inhabitant, and every Object, glori|fies GOD, and is filled with his Glory. His Perfections, and his Love takes them intirely up; and nothing el&s;e is &s;een, or heard, or thought of. O happy, happy State! The Converted Soul knows a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> what this means: but what it <HI>fully</HI> is, we <HI>know not now, we &s;hall know hereafter. Eye has not &s;een, nor Ear heard, nor can the Heart of man conceive it all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003510_0027_0FF85423350C6DD8">
The&s;e, ye Converted Souls, are the Joys &s;et before you! The&s;e are the Glories, and this the Felicity re&s;erved in Heaven for you.

<L>Awake, my tuneful Pow'rs:</L>
<L>In con&s;tant Prai&s;e my grateful Tongue</L>
<L>Shall fill my foll'wing Hours.</L>

<L>Guilty, condemn'd, undone I &s;tood;</L>
<L>I bid my GOD depart:</L>
<L>He took my Sins, and paid his Blood,</L>
<L>And <HI>turn'd</HI> this wand'ring Heart</L>

<L>Death, the grim Tyrant, &s;eiz'd my Frame,</L>
<L><HI>Vile,</HI> loath&s;ome and accur&s;t:</L>
<L>His Breath renews the vital Flame,</L>
<L>And Glories <HI>change</HI> the Du&s;t.</L>

<L>Now, SAVIOUR, &s;hall thy Prai&s;e commence;</L>
<L>My Soul by Thee brought Home,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Member, ev'ry Sen&s;e,</L>
<L>Recover'd from the Tomb.</L>

<L>To Thee my Rea&s;on I &s;ubmit,</L>
<L>My Love, my Mem'ry, LORD,</L>
<L>My Eyes to read, my Hands to write,</L>
<L>My Lips to preach thy Word.</L>
