<HEAD>CARRICKFERGUS ASSIZES. BEFORE THE RIGHT HON. BARON YELVER|TON, AND JUDGE CHAMBERLAINE. MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1797. TRIAL OF WILLIAM ORR, <HI>FOR ADMINISTERING UNLAWFUL OATHS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t witne&s;s called was <HI>Hugh Wheatley,</HI> &s;oldier in the Fife&s;hire Fencibles.&mdash;He &s;aid, that in April 1796, he returned from Scotland, where he had been on furlough. On going by Antrim, to join his regiment at Derry, along with othertwo &s;oldiers, one of them named Lind&s;ay, they went into a public-hou&s;e, where they met with a per&s;on named Campbell, and another named Orr, not the pri&s;oner. After leaving that hou&s;e, they went along a road, where Campbell introduced the witne&s;s to Orr, the pri&s;oner, who was in a field &s;owing flax. He came out of the field, and they all went to a hou&s;e, where a number of people &s;oon a&s;&s;embled, and they put a vote among them&s;elves, whether they &s;hould put the Con&s;titution book into the pri&s;oner's hands. They agreed to do &s;o, and the pri&s;oner, acting as pre&s;ident, held out a book to the witne&s;s to &s;wear on. The witne&s;s at fir&s;t re|fu&s;ed to &s;wear, but afterwards did &s;o, being told his life was not worth a farthing, if he did not come into their way of thinking. The oath was, to keep the &s;ecrets of United Iri&s;hmen, and not, for any reward, to di&s;cover on them. They &s;aid, they wanted a Reform in Parliament, and, if they did not get it by fair means, they would overthrow the Con&s;titution; and that they meant to have as many military or armed men on their &s;ide as to effect it. They gave him, the witne&s;s, a Con&s;titution book to take his di|rections from, with orders, that as &s;oon as he joined his regiment, he was to &s;wear in as many as he could; and
<PB N="6" REF="034281_0005_0FFD7D58B3835CD8">
when &s;even were made, they were to form a Committee, and then the book would direct them what to do. That while the witne&s;s and his companions were in Antrim and the neighbourhood, they were &s;upported in the hou&s;e of John Hyndman, and paid nothing for it; and when they left Antrim, they got five &s;hillings from the pri&s;oner, and &s;ixpence from another man. After the witne&s;s had been &s;worn a United Iri&s;hman, the per&s;ons who were in the room gave him certain &s;igns by which to know United Iri&s;hmen, and explained them to him.&mdash;The fir&s;t &s;ign was, <HI>"Lift the right hand, and draw it down over the right &s;ide of the face&mdash;2d, Lift the left hand, and draw it down over the left &s;ide of the face&mdash;3d, Shake hands by the left hands&mdash;4th,</HI> Say, <HI>What do you know? I know</HI> U.&mdash;<HI>What do you know more? I know</HI> T." or &s;ome other letters of the word UNITY or UNITED.&mdash;Campbell invited him, the witne&s;s, and Lind&s;ay, to his hou&s;e, a little way from An|trim, where they were &s;hewn arms, and a paper called the Northern Star; and in his garden they were &s;hewn a draw well, which, they were told, would be a nice place to put the Ari&s;tocrats.</P>

<P><HI>John Lind&s;ay,</HI> &s;oldier in the Fife&s;hire Fencibles, &s;aid that when he and Wheatley came from Scotland, and were re|turning to Derry by Antrim, they &s;aw the pri&s;oner, who gave Wheatley a book, and &s;wore him not to di&s;cover the &s;ecrets of the United Iri&s;hmen for any &s;ee or reward, or to give evidence again&s;t any of them. There was a &s;ociety there, which they called the <HI>Baronial Meeting,</HI> and Camp|bell and the pri&s;oner were there. Wheatley got a Con&s;ti|tution book&mdash;he, the witne&s;s, did not get one, and does not know the object of the United Iri&s;hmen, but took the oath of &s;ecrecy admini&s;tered by the pri&s;oner in Hynd|man's hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Curran,</HI> in behalf of the pri&s;oner, addre&s;&s;ed the Court as to the con&s;truction of the act of Parliament upon which the pri&s;oner was tried. He took notice of the va|rious acts of the Legi&s;lature which had been pa&s;&s;ed from time to time, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing and preventing tumultuous ri&s;ings, prohibiting the-admini&s;tering of unlawful oaths, &amp;c. &amp;c. He remarked, that the act 36th of the king, upon which the pri&s;oner was now tried, made the penalty death. He contended, that if the two witne&s;&s;es who had been examined were to be believed, their evidence
<PB N="8" REF="034281_0007_0FFD7D8078649988">
amounted to a proof of High Trea&s;on, and &s;urely the crime of High Trea&s;on could not be tried by any other law than that which applied to it. The objection, therefore, which he had to the pre&s;ent trial, was this; that the body of crime contained in the evidence, was not a crime of the nature laid in the indictment, but a crime of High Trea|&s;on. It follows, then, that if a per&s;on be charged with a crime amounting to High Trea&s;on, he ought to be tried by the law which relates to High Trea&s;on, and then he will be entitled to all the advantages which that law gives him.</P>
<P>The abilities of Mr. Curran are &s;ufficiently known, and &s;tand in no need of encomium. Upon this occa&s;ion they were exerted with all their force and energy; and he went over an exten&s;ive field of argument, to &s;hew that the in|dictment, in its pre&s;ent &s;hape, ought to be qua&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>The Attorney General</HI> &s;aid a few words in reply to Mr. Cur|ran&mdash;He remarked that notice had been taken of the pro|cedure of the Crown in &s;ome trials, as tending to &s;hew that &s;uch procedure had been rigorous and &s;evere. But he &s;aid he could challenge any one to point out a ca&s;e where the pri&s;oner had not received every indulgence con|&s;i&s;tent with the due admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; and he thought that any remarks thrown out, tending to impre&s;s the minds of the people with a contrary opinion, were equally unju&s;t and improper. The Attorney General was proceeding to an&s;wer &s;ome of Mr. Curran's arguments, when</P>
<P><HI>Judge Yelverton</HI> &s;aid, that he had li&s;tened with patience to hear every argument that could be &s;ugge&s;ted for the pri&s;oner; and he had di&s;covered that it all went to call upon him to qua&s;h the pre&s;ent trial. He thought, however, he could not be ju&s;tifiable in complying with this&mdash;He thought too, the objection was ill timed, it ought to have been made at a much earlier &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and and not re&s;erved till now, when the whole evidence on the part of the Crown had been divulged.</P>

Wheatley, the &s;oldier. About January la&s;t he, the witne&s;s, had a conver&s;ation with Wheatley, whom he overtook with Serjeant Miller on the road from Ballyclare to Car|rick&mdash;They all went into a hou&s;e on the road &s;ide and had a gla&s;s of &s;pirits. There was a man lying in a bed in the room were they were; he &s;poke to Miller, having been formerly in the &s;ervice with him. After one half pint was drunk another was called for, and before it was drank Wheatley called the witne&s;s out and they went on the road together&mdash;Wheatley a&s;ked him if he knew Mr. Orr, who was in pri&s;on, and if he would go into the jail to &s;erve him&mdash;He, the witne&s;s, &s;aid he could not get into the jail and did not then know Orr&mdash;Wheatley &s;aid "you mu&s;t try to do it, and tell Orr if he will put a different coloured coat upon me and &s;ome money I will de&s;ert; and if he will get another coat and two guineas, I will get Lind&s;ay to de&s;ert al&s;o, for Lind&s;ay was as ready to go as him&s;elf." Wheatley then added, they had &s;logged him in Ballymoney for his prin|ciples, and when taking off his coat had de&s;troyed papers about the United Iri&s;hman, which he was &s;orry for, and that he had per&s;evered in &s;everal towns. Soon after this Wheatley again &s;aid you mu&s;t go into jail to be of &s;ervice to Orr, but the witne&s;s replied as he did not know Orr, he would not believe him; then &s;aid Wheatley, "here is a &s;a|cred note," holding up his right hand with a cartridge in it. He added that it was not he but Lind&s;ay that had &s;worn again&s;t Orr, and that Lind&s;ay would &s;wear the Hill of Howth in Scotland was no larger than a pound of can|dles in a chandler's &s;hop.&mdash;At this time Serjeant Miller came up with them and they dropt the conver&s;ation. When the witne&s;s arrived in Carrickfergus, he applied to a Magi&s;trate who gave him a line to get into the pri&s;on, where he &s;aw Orr, who did not know him, but one Story who was there knew him and introduced him to Orr, to whom he delivered the me&s;&s;age from the &s;oldier. When Orr heard it he &s;tared, would not believe it and &s;aid he was a villain&mdash;The witne&s;s returned &s;oon after to Wheatley, who was waiting for an an&s;wer&mdash;They went together into a Mr. Ander&s;on's, where they got &s;ome porter, and Wheat|ley urged him to go into the jail again but he would not do it.</P>

With regard to Lind&s;ay's evidence, his Lord&s;hip &s;aid, that &s;o far as it went, it &s;upported that which had been given by Wheatley;
<PB N="11" REF="034281_0010_0FFD7D6DAF45A388">
and, upon the whole, tho&s;e two witne&s;&s;es were, in their evidence, con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves and with each other. It was true, &s;ome witne&s;&s;es had been adduced to di&s;prove what Wheatley had &s;aid, but the&s;e witne&s;&s;es differed ma|terially with each other. M'Claverty &s;ays, that the con|ver&s;ation between him and Wheatley, relative to his going into pri&s;on to reque&s;t Orr to give money, &amp;c. to him to de&s;ert, took place immediately after they came out of the hou&s;e where they had been drinking on the road to Car|rick, and that Serjeant Miller was then left behind; while Serjeant Miller &s;ays, that they all came out of the hou&s;e together, and no conver&s;ation of the nature men|tioned could have taken place without his hearing it: he admits, however, that when about a quarter of a mile from Carrick, he &s;tepped a&s;ide, and Wheatley and M'Claverty walked on together, &s;o that, if any conver&s;ation took place, it mu&s;t have been then, and not at the time mentioned by M'Claverty.</P>

<P>The Jury were then inclo&s;ed, and remained &s;o from &s;even o'clock in the evening till &s;ix o'clock in the morning, when they returned a verdict of GUILTY, but re|commended the pri&s;oner to mercy.

<P>William Orr, for admini&s;tering unlawful oaths to two &s;oldiers, and found guilty on Monday, was &s;entenced to be hanged on the 7th of October next.&mdash;It is much to the honour of Baron Yelverton, that we have to ob&s;erve, that in pronouncing the awful &s;entence on this unhappy man, he was &s;o deeply affected as &s;carcely to be able, articulately, to conclude a very impre&s;&s;ive addre&s;s. The tears gu&s;hed from his eyes, and covering his face with both his hands, his Lord&s;hip, greatly agitated, remained in that &s;ituation for &s;everal minutes. In this addre&s;s, the Baron told Mr. Orr, that though recommended to mercy by the Jury, he thought it would be the greate&s;t cruelty to flatter him with any hopes of a remi&s;&s;ion of the &s;entence, which it had been his painful office to pronounce, and &s;trongly re|commended to him to make the be&s;t u&s;e of his time in making his peace with God, and in preparing for that atonement, which he was de&s;tined to make to the offended laws of his country.</P>
<P>[Mr. Orr is a very re&s;pectable farmer, and a man of property in the neighbourhood of Antrim, where he has re&s;ided all his life-time with a fair and unblemi&s;hed cha|racter.

<HEAD>A SHORT SKETCH OF MR. CURRAN'S SPEECH:</HEAD>
<P>When Mr. Curran contended for an arre&s;t of judgment, he argued with all that brilliancy of imagination and force of rea&s;oning, for which this gentleman is &s;o ju&s;tly cele|brated&mdash;He &s;aid, That the jury &s;hould be di&s;charged of the indictment, and that they &s;hould be directed to acquit the pri&s;oner; if the te&s;timony of the informer was true, the guilt which it proved was not a crime of Felony under the In&s;urrection Act, but a crime of High Trea&s;on under the Statute of Edward III. A man charged with High Trea&s;on in Great Britain, has advantages of defence which make it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for an innocent man to fall a victim to the mere malice of per&s;ecution: he mu&s;t have a copy of the indictment; the overt-acts mu&s;t be expre&s;sly charged; <HI>the bla&s;ted breath of one venal Informer cannot de&s;|troy him.</HI> In that country there mu&s;t be two witne&s;&s;es at the lea&s;t. Even in Ireland, <HI>where life does not &s;eem to be of &s;o much value,</HI> the man accu&s;ed of Trea&s;on has advantages peculiar to his &s;ituation; he is entitled to an exact copy of his charge, and a full defence by his Coun&s;el in point of law and in fact. The State mu&s;t avow it&s;elf as the pro&s;e|cutor; it cannot wage a piratical war again&s;t his life, un|der fal&s;e colours; and if it pro&s;ecutes him maliciou&s;ly, he is authori&s;ed by his Coun&s;el to di&s;play every circum&s;tance of his ca&s;e to his Jury, and of appealing to every &s;en&s;e of their duty, their ju&s;tice, their humanity, and their danger, for his protection. To try him, therefore, under this Act, which gave him none of tho&s;e advantages, was to try him without hearing him, and was an oppre&s;&s;ion unwarranted by the Law of the Land. This objection, it was &s;aid, might appear at fir&s;t &s;ight to be novel and hazardous. As to its novelty, it was the fir&s;t time that &s;uch a proceeding, was ever attempted, and the objection to it mu&s;t be there|fore new. It might certainly be thought de&s;perate to &s;eek a refuge from a charge of Felony under the Law Trea|&s;on; and it was only to be lamented that the melancholy &s;tate of the Country &s;o fully ju&s;tified &s;uch a conduct.</P>

<P>On Saturday morning early the Rev. Mr. Stavely and the Rev. Mr. Hill vi&s;ited Mr. Orr, by his own de&s;ire, in pri&s;on. They remained with him all the forenoon; and about half after one o'clock Mr. Orr left the pri&s;on and went into a chai&s;e, accompanied by the&s;e gentlemen. A con&s;iderable number of military, con&s;i&s;ting of part of the Fife&s;hire Fencibles, the Monaghan Militia, the Reay Fen|cibles, the Carrickfergus Invalids, a party of the 22d Dra|goons, and the Carrickfergus Yeoman Cavalry, as al&s;o a party of the Artillery, with two pieces of cannon, were attending. The High Sheriff, on hor&s;eback, preceded the carriage. The Sub Sheriff, al&s;o on hor&s;eback, followed it. The whole proceeded, in &s;olemn, flow proce&s;&s;ion, from the jail to the place of execution, about three quarters of a mile from Carrickfergus. Mr. Orr and the two clergymen, then alighted from the carriage, and the pri&s;oner having a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion of the High Sheriff to allow a few of his friends to be near him, it was in&s;tantly granted.</P>
<P>About an hour was &s;pent in devotional exerci&s;es, which Mr. Orr joined with much &s;ervency, and during the whole period of time, and amid the awful &s;olemnity, he pre&s;erved a degree of calm fortitude, and when the fatal moment ar|rived he drew from his pocket a few printed papers, to which his name was adhibited, containing his dying decla|ration, the&s;e he di&s;tributed among the per&s;ons who were near him. This done, he &s;hook hands with his &s;urrounding friends, and very affectionately bade them farewel&mdash;He then mounted the &s;caffold with a firm &s;tep, and the appa|ratus of death being adju&s;ted, he was launched into eternity about three o'clock.&mdash;After hanging three quarters of an hour, the body was taken down and delivered to his friends, by whom it was conveyed away on a hear&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>The DYING DECLARATION of WILLIAM ORR, of Fer|ran&s;hane, in the county of Antrim, Farmer TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends and Countrymen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the thirty-fir&s;t year of my life, I have been &s;entenced to die upon the gallows, and this &s;entence has been in pur|&s;uance of a verdict of twelve men, who &s;hould have been indifferently and impartially cho&s;en; how far they have been &s;o, I leave to that country from which they have been cho&s;en, to determine; and how far they have di&s;charged their duty, I leave to their God and to them&s;elves.&mdash;They have, in pronouncing their verdict, thought proper to re|commend me as an object of humane mercy; in return, I pray to God, if they have erred, to have mercy upon them. The Judge, who condemned me, humanely &s;hed tears in uttering my &s;entence, but whether he did wi&s;ely in &s;o highly commending the wretched Informer, who &s;wore away my life, I leave to his own cool reflection, &s;olemnly a&s;&s;uring him and all the world, with my dying breath, that that informer was for&s;worn. The law under which I &s;uffer, is &s;urely a &s;evere one; may the makers and pro|moters of it be ju&s;tified in the integrity of their motives and the purity of their own lives&mdash;by that law, I am &s;tamped a &s;elon, but my heart di&s;dains the imputation. My com|fortable lot and indu&s;trious cour&s;e of life, be&s;t refute the charge of being an adventurer for plunder; but if to have loved my Country, to have known its wrongs, to have felt the injuries of the per&s;ecuted Catholics, and to have united with them and all other religious per&s;ua&s;ions in the mo&s;t orderly and lea&s;t &s;anguinary means of procuring redre&s;s:&mdash;If the&s;e be &s;elonies, I am a &s;elon, but not otherwi&s;e. Had my Council (for who&s;e honourable exertions I am indebted) prevailed in their motion to have me tried for high trea&s;on, rather than under the <HI>In&s;urrection</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, I &s;hould have been intitled then to a full defence, and my actions and intentions would have been better vindicated,
<PB N="16" REF="034281_0015_0FFD7D78CB6AD618">
but that was refu&s;ed, and I mu&s;t now &s;ubmit to what has pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>To the generous protection of my Country, I leave a be|loved wife, who has been con&s;tant and true to me, and who&s;e grief for my fate has already nearly occa&s;ioned her death.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This unhappy woman, in the &s;eventh month of her pregnancy, died on the day of her hu&s;band's execution.</NOTE> I leave five living children, who have been my de|light&mdash;may they love their Country as I have done, and die for it, if needful.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, a fal&s;e and ungenerous publication having appeared in a news-paper, &s;tating, certain alleged con|fe&s;&s;ions of guilt on my part, and thus &s;triking at my repu|tation, which is dearer to me than life, I take this &s;olemn method of contradicting that calumny:&mdash;I was applied to by the high &s;heriff and the Rev. William Bri&s;tow, Sove|reign of Belfa&s;t, to make a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt, who u&s;ed entreaties to that effect; this I peremptorily refu&s;ed; did I think my&s;elf guilty, I &s;hould be free to confe&s;s it; but on the contrary, I glory in my innocence.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t that all my virtuous Countrymen will bear me in their kind remembrance, and continue true and faithful to each other, as I have been to all of them; with this la&s;t wi&s;h of my heart, nothing doubting of the &s;ucce&s;s of that cau&s;e in which I &s;uffer, and hoping for God's merciful forgivene&s;s of &s;uch offences as my frail nature may have at any time betrayed me into, I die in peace and charity with all mankind.</P>

<P>IT is with extreme reluctance that we addre&s;s the public on &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a &s;ubject&mdash;but having &s;een a printed pa|per, &s;igned William Orr, which was delivered by him ye&s;|terday,
<PB N="17" REF="034281_0016_0FFE5E9F9CA2BBF8">
as his dying declaration, at the place of execution, in which was this a&s;&s;ertion, viz. "I was applied to by the high &s;heriff, and the Rev. Wm. Bri&s;tow, Sovereign of Bel|fa&s;t, to make a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt, who u&s;ed entreaties to that effect: this I peremptorily refu&s;ed."</P>
<P>We think it a duty we owe to our&s;elves and to the pub|lic, to &s;tate preci&s;ely the purport of our conver&s;ation with the unfortunate man, on the &s;ubject alluded to in his de|claration, and the circum&s;tances that led to it.</P>
<P>Being at Carrickfergus on Wedne&s;day the 27th ult. to attend an election of an Alderman and Burge&s;&s;es for that Corporation&mdash;the &s;heriff expre&s;&s;ed an intention of going into the jail, for the purpo&s;e of &s;eeing if the pri&s;oner (Mr. Orr) had every rea&s;onable accommodation that his un|fortunate &s;ituation would admit of, and reque&s;ted Mr. Bri&s;tow to accompany him.&mdash;After &s;ome enquiries from the pri&s;oner to that effect, and &s;ome ob&s;ervations on a religious book which Mr. Orr had been reading, Mr. Bri&s;|tow &s;aid to him, "Sir, I have &s;een a paper which your brother and another gentleman brought to the &s;heriff on Monday la&s;t, with your name annexed to it, in which you acknowledged the ju&s;tice of your &s;entence, and cautioned others again&s;t being led into bad practices by wicked and de&s;igning men." Mr. Bri&s;tow added, that it was expected, from what your brother and that gentleman told the &s;he|riff, that it would have been publi&s;hed in la&s;t Monday's Belfa&s;t paper. "I am confident, &s;aid Mr. Bri&s;tow to Mr. Orr, that this acknowledgement, which you had for &s;ome time withheld, mu&s;t now afford you great comfort." Mr. Orr replied, "Yes, Sir, it has relieved my mind very much."&mdash;Mr. Bri&s;tow then &s;aid to Mr. Orr, "As you are con|&s;cious of your guilt, it is your bounden duty, if you know of any con&s;piracy again&s;t the State, to make a di&s;covery of any circum&s;tance you may know, which can throw any light upon it, as the only reparation you can make to your injured country." Mr. Orr replied, "I can recollect none at pre&s;ent." The &s;heriff then &s;aid&mdash;"Mr. Orr, if, upon reflection, you &s;hould hereafter recollect any circum|&s;tances of that nature which you would wi&s;h to commu|nicate, I will, upon your application, immediately attend

you; or Mr. Bri&s;tow, I am certain, will do &s;o, or any other magi&s;trate of the county." Mr. Orr replied, "I thank you, Sir.</P>
<P>This we affirm was the whole &s;ub&s;tance of what then pa&s;&s;ed between us and the unfortunate William Orr, and, as nearly as we can recollect, the exact words&mdash;and that we never had a conver&s;ation with him on that &s;ubject at any other time,</P>

<P>Thus far the account, <HI>printed by permi&s;&s;ion,</HI> except Mr. Orr's Dying Declaration, which was not allowed to ap|pear, and to counteract the effects of which upon the pub|lic mind, the Counter-declaration of the Sheriff and So|vereign was made and publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>But it is nece&s;&s;ary for the better under&s;tanding of Mr. Orr's unfortunate ca&s;e, to &s;tate &s;ome circum&s;tances, which, in the minds of all humane and impartial men, mu&s;t have great weight, and make them &s;till more deplore his unhappy cata&s;trophe&mdash;viz.</P>
<P>It appears, that two of the jurors voluntarily came for|ward and &s;olemnly made oath, <Q>That when they retired to their room to deliberate upon the evidence given again&s;t Mr. Orr, liquor was introduced, and in&s;tead of deliberately and impartially weighing every circum&s;tance, they proceeded to drink, and to &s;uch a degree, that there was almo&s;t a general intoxication!&mdash;Even in this &s;tate there was doubt and he&s;itation, when one of the jurors [the foreman] u&s;ed threats to intimidate the re&s;t; he charged them with harbouring <HI>di&s;loyal</HI> principles, and &s;hould they refu&s;e to join him in finding Mr. Orr guilty, he denounced vengeance again&s;t them.</Q>&mdash;It was under this intimidation that the jury, at length, a&s;&s;ented to the
