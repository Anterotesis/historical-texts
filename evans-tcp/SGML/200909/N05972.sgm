<BIBL>Epi&s;tle to the GALATIANS, Chap. iv. Ver. 18.</BIBL>
<Q>It is good to be zealou&s;ly affected al|ways in a good Thing.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THERE is no Duty more needful to be &s;trenuou&s;ly and univer&s;ally inculcated, than what any Text conci&s;ely, but em|phatically, recommends; nor any Op|portunity, wherein I may hope to do it with more Advantage, than what now &s;olemnly offers it&s;elf.&mdash;</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing on the&s;e memorable Words, I &s;hall, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> explain the true Purport of them; &s;howing under what Limitations the glorious Virtue, here en|join'd, is to be under&s;tood; and at the &s;ame Time proving that the Practice of it, as it &s;prings from laudable Principles, and is manag'd by a right Con|duct, is truly a religious, as well as civil Duty.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall demon&s;trate from &s;ome In&s;tances, of <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory chiefly, that in Proportion as this Queen of Virtues was more or le&s;s a&s;&s;erted, cheri&s;h'd, and epidemically diffus'd, the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s, or the Fall and Declen&s;ion, of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> State, and indeed
<PB N="10" REF="007574_0007_102D7BDF1914BEF0">of the mo&s;t potent Empires and Common-Wealths, and con&s;equently of Arts and Sciences, may be trac'd and a&s;certain'd.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I &s;hall, as cogently as I can, enfore the Doctrine of this divine Precept, with a particular Appli|cation to my re&s;pectable Auditors, not only to each In|dividual, intere&s;ted as a Member of the Society in the Welfare and Pre&s;ervation of his Country; but, with all Humility and Deference, to the <HI>Three Branches</HI> of it's Legi&s;lature; mo&s;t of whom, I was, at a &s;hort Warn|ing, inform'd, wou'd previou&s;ly convene at this &s;acred Place, to implore the Ble&s;&s;ing of Almighty GOD on their Con&s;ultations, for taking the mo&s;t &s;peedy, effec|tual, and &s;alutary Mea&s;ures to &s;ecure the public Peace, Honour, and Emolument, in this critical Juncture: And this I &s;hall dutifully and con&s;cientiou&s;ly endea|vour to perform, by urging to you &s;ome of the princi|pal Motives, that ought to influence a Chri&s;tian, in|&s;tigate a Commonwealth&s;man, and animate a true <HI>Briton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to &s;et forth the true Purport of the Words of my Text; &s;howing what the glorious Vir|tue is, and under what Circum&s;criptions it is here en|join'd; and proving, as it &s;prings from laudable Prin|ciples, and is manag'd by a well-temper'd Conduct, that the Practice of it is truly a religious, as well as civil Duty.</P>
<P><HI>It is good to be zealou&s;ly affected always in a good Thing.</HI>&mdash;Which is as much as to &s;ay in Paraphra&s;e, &mdash;It is an indi&s;pen&s;able Duty, univer&s;ally, and, in
<PB N="11" REF="007574_0008_102D7BE0E7041D08">cour&s;e, obligatory on Chri&s;tian Converts under the Light of the Go&s;pel, as it was before on all Nations under the mere moral Guidance of Nature, (&s;ince it is ab&s;urd and impious to maintain, that the Laws of the Former cou'd ever &s;uper&s;ede or contradict the genuine Dictates of the Latter, which they were intended to &s;trengthen, and give a higher Sanction to) on all, without Exception, obligatory; and that too, at all Times,&mdash;<Q>To be cordially affected with a good Thing, in Proportion to the Object exciting this Affection, or the Exigence requiring it.</Q>&mdash;Or, in other Words,&mdash;<Q>To apply the Faculties of our Minds, and the Powers of our Bodies, with the prudential Influence of our re&s;pective Stations and Fortunes, for the Advancement of a good Cau&s;e, for obtaining, by hone&s;t Means, hone&s;t Ends, whether they regard a local and le&s;s general Welfare in an inferior De|gree, or the Utility of the whole Community in the <HI>highe&s;t.</HI></Q></P>
<P>So, you &s;ee, Zeal, in general, is the grand Virtue here recommended by the eminent Apo&s;tle, not only to the Churches of <HI>Galatia,</HI> to whom he particularly addre&s;&s;es this Epi&s;tle, but to all Di&s;ciples of CHRIST, where&s;oever di&s;per&s;t, to whom he de&s;ign'd his &s;acred Writings &s;hou'd be duly and impartially communica|ted, in order to be tran&s;crib'd, and publicly read in their A&s;&s;emblies of Wor&s;hip, for the Benefit of all Ranks of People. Nor did the mighty <HI>Saint Paul</HI> think it &s;ufficient barely to act as the Scribe of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> but he mo&s;t remarkably di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf in being on all proper Occa&s;ions the practical and fore|mo&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="007574_0009_102D7BE2AC86BA38">Example of the noble Precept he delivers. No Difficulties di&s;courag'd; no Dangers deterr'd; no pri|vate Avocations diverted him (as with a generous Con&s;cion&s;ne&s;s, but mode&s;t Declaration, he informs us), from the arduous Work of his Mini&s;try; from &s;erving the Cau&s;e of his GOD, his Countrymen, and Mankind. Hence it is, that he &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ts on the full Exertion of all the adequate Ardour, which a good Cau&s;e calls for in Execution: All the Heroi&s;m, which Virtue glowingly &s;ugge&s;ts, or Chri&s;tianity in&s;pires. As the Practice of his Ma&s;ter's Di&s;pen&s;ation was very pro|perly &s;til'd a Warfare; what forceful Images, what bold Figures, does he borrow from the military Art and <HI>Roman</HI> Di&s;cipline, to train up his Pupils by the holy Exerci&s;e for glorious Exploits in the Combats they were de&s;tin'd to; for the various Lists they were to wre&s;tle in; <Q>for fighting again&s;t Principalities and Powers; and the Rulers of the Darkne&s;s of this World; again&s;t &s;piritual Wickedne&s;s in high Places? They are commanded to put on the whole Armour of GOD: To gird their Loins with Truth: To a&s;&s;ume the Brea&s;t-plate of Righteou&s;ne&s;s: To &s;tand firm in the Po&s;t of Honour: To inve&s;t their Heads with the Helmet of Salvation: To wield the Sword of the Spirit: And, above all, to defend them&s;elves with the Shield of Faith, whereby they might quench, or repel, all the fiery Darts of the Wick|ed.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Again, in being obliged to propo&s;e him&s;elf, as a Pattern to them of Patience and Fortitude, while he indu&s;triou&s;ly guards again&s;t Imputations of Vanity,
<PB N="13" REF="007574_0010_102D7BE497D9C620">with what per&s;ua&s;ive, what re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Eloquence, does this con&s;ummate Orator (&s;carce le&s;s humanly learned, than divinely in&s;pir'd) in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the Hearts of his Readers, and captivate their Pa&s;&s;ions, while he convinces their Under&s;tandings? Such was this In&s;tru|ment of Providence for accompli&s;hing the mo&s;t impor|tant Enterprizes; this <HI>Elect of GOD:</HI>&mdash;Not ar|bitrarily &s;o, but becoming his <HI>cho&s;en Ve&s;&s;el</HI> from the previous Di&s;po&s;ition of a good Heart to engage in a good Cau&s;e at all Adventures: And that he vitally and in|timately felt, what he wou'd pro&s;elyte others to, we cannot doubt, when he thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to his Countrymen, proverbially proud of the Origin of their Nation! "Are you <HI>Hebrews?</HI> So am I!&mdash;(And, by anticipating the Application of the &s;ub&s;equent Part of this Sermon, let me too &s;omewhat abruptly &s;ay,&mdash;Are you <HI>Engli&s;hmen?</HI> Are you, my Hearers, <HI>Britons?</HI>&mdash;You are: All are: So am I!&mdash; And therefore, independent of my &s;acred Function, I have a natural Claim to your Attention.) But, to proceed, <Q>Are you <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> or of the Seed of <HI>Abra|bam?</HI> So am I! In Labours more abundant: In Stripes above Mea&s;ure: In Pri&s;ons frequent: In Deaths oft: Of the <HI>Jews</HI> five Times receiv'd I forty Stripes, &s;ave one: Thrice was I beaten with Rods: Once was I &s;ton'd: Thrice I &s;uffer'd Shipwreck: A Night and a Day have I been in the Deep: In Journeying often: In Perils of Water: In Perils of Robbers: In Perils of mine own Countrymen: In Perils by the Heathen: In Perils in the City: In Perils in the Wilderne&s;s: In Perils in the Sea: In Perils among fal&s;e Brethren: In Wearine&s;s and
<PB N="14" REF="007574_0011_102D7BE6A8BAAA90">Painfulne&s;s: In Watchings often: In Hunger and Thir&s;t: In Fa&s;tings often: In Cold and Nakedne&s;s: And (be&s;ides tho&s;e numberle&s;s Things, that are without) that, which cometh upon me daily, the Care of all the Churches.</Q></P>
<P>Thus equally from the Doctrine and Example of Saint <HI>Paul</HI> (without in&s;i&s;ting on many other Scriptural In&s;tances, no le&s;s pertinent) we may be &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ur'd, that Zeal, rightly under&s;tood and well-regula|ted, is truly a Chri&s;tian and Social Virtue; not only &s;peculatively to be a&s;&s;ented to by Rea&s;on, but incum|bent on the Votaries of CHRIST, to be carry'd into Act with Alacrity and A&s;&s;iduity, as be&s;t may &s;erve the meritorious Purpo&s;es, which are only attainable by its A&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;The Phra&s;e indeed, <HI>to be zealou&s;ly af|fected,</HI> however obvious to all candid and ordinary Under&s;tandings, is often liable to be abus'd, and gro&s;&s;|ly mi&s;apply'd by ra&s;h and precipitate Men. It means no more than an inten&s;e Bent of Mind and vigorous Attachment to whatever we are engag'd in, or con|cern'd about; and, like all other Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as Love, Anger, and the like, may be laudable or culpa|ble; equally productive of the noble&s;t Ends, or mo&s;t ruinous Con&s;equences, according as it is kept within due Bounds, or permitted to &s;well to Exce&s;s; and its intrin&s;ic Goodne&s;s or Badne&s;s mu&s;t be determin'd by its Motive, Object, and Degree. Thus the Violence of this very <HI>Saint Paul</HI> for per&s;ecuting the Church of CHRIST, before his Conver&s;ion, is call'd Zeal: The &s;ame Word which he u&s;es, for the Virtue he &s;o highly commends in my Text; where he takes Care (as the
<PB N="15" REF="007574_0012_102D7BE876DE91E0">Mark and Criterion of Di&s;tinction) to direct the Regu|lation of our Zeal, by confining it to be employ'd always in a good Thing; for then only it&s;elf can be always good. It nearly behoves us then, that our Zeal be occupy'd rightly; otherwi&s;e it degenerates into wild Folly, Madne&s;s and Sin; and the more we are tran&s;ported by it, the more Guilt we &s;hall contract. To be zealous for the Honour of GOD, for the In|tere&s;t and Propagation of our holy Religion; for the Benefit of our Species, or the Pro&s;perity of our Country, is no Doubt, of all other Things, mo&s;t prai&s;e-worthy; though even in the&s;e Ca&s;es our Zeal may be mi&s;guided and &s;adly perverted, and &s;o lo&s;e all its Value and Re|ward.&mdash;But, on the other Hand, Luke-warmne&s;s and Indifference therein, is certainly mo&s;t ba&s;e and unmanly in the Sen&s;e of Nature, and, from various Authorities in the Word of GOD, mo&s;t degrading and &s;inful. <Q>Thou &s;halt love the Lord, thy GOD, with thine Heart, with all thy Mind, with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength: And thy Neighbour (in which general Word our Country is mainly included) as thy &s;elf,</Q> is declar'd by our Saviour to be the E&s;&s;ence and Sum of Religion, and to comprehend the whole of the Law and the Prophets.&mdash;That is,&mdash;All divine, &s;ocial, and moral Duties, perfective of our Na|tures, and preparative to our Happine&s;s. And here it is remarkable, how emphatically, and with what repe|titious Enforcements our Lord urges a well-grounded Zeal; excluding from it, le&s;t his Meaning &s;hould be convey'd in too feeble a manner, all Coldne&s;s, Li&s;tle&s;s|ne&s;s and vile Mediocrity. Indeed in all his Actions, in all his private Documents, and public Sermons, in
<PB N="16" REF="007574_0013_102D7BEA978F24A8">his Life, and in his Death, he di&s;plays, with an Ener|gy becoming the Captain of our Salvation, his Appro|bation, beyond all others, of this Virtue, &s;oaring to all the warrantable and rational Degrees, to which it may be exalted. Nay, he exhibits it as the Te&s;t and Characteri&s;tic of his faithful Militants, his noble Army of veteran Martyrs and Confe&s;&s;ors; and, we know, a Diffu&s;ion of this generous Principle among them, ren|der'd them more than Conquerers in the mid&s;t of Flames; till, triumphant over ten bloody Per&s;ecutions of mercile&s;s Tyrants, they &s;ubdu'd all the Rage and Fury of Fiends and Men; of &s;piritual and incarnate Demons, a&s;&s;ociated again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Again, &s;ays our Redeemer, deterring us from an Abatement of true Zeal: <Q>He, that loves Father or Mother, Brother or Si&s;ter, Wife or Children, more than me, is not worthy to be my Di&s;ciple:</Q> And we may ea&s;ily conceive, by attending to the true Im|port of the&s;e Words, that he means not hereby to de|&s;troy the Ties of the&s;e &s;acred Relation&s;hips, or in the lea&s;t to relax, or weaken them, when he el&s;ewhere takes all Occa&s;ions tenderly to &s;trengthen them, both as natural and po&s;itive Duties; but that, when any Concernments of an inferior Kind happen to come in Competition with tho&s;e of a &s;uperior Importance, &s;o as that an ab&s;olute Adherence to the former cannot be maintain'd, without Renouncing the latter, then the higher Obligation mu&s;t take Place, and indi&s;pen&s;ably claims our Pre&s;erence. Thus a well-regulated Zeal, without more ado, will dictate to us, that the Glory of our univer&s;al Father, <HI>who is in Heaven,</HI> mu&s;t be
<PB N="17" REF="007574_0014_102D7BECCB03D300">nearer our Hearts, than our Affections to our earthly Parents, who are but his In&s;truments, and &s;econdary Agents for our Being. Thus all, who enjoy the va|rious Benefits and Protection of the Laws of a Society are &s;trictly and fundamentally bound to a primary Re|gard for its Health and Safety beyond le&s;&s;er Con&s;idera|tions, per&s;onal Views, &s;maller Alliances, and the like: And if we wou'd de&s;erve for our Zeal to be &s;til'd, like <HI>David,</HI> Men after GOD's own Heart, our Love to the Community mu&s;t &s;urmount the&s;e, even as much as the Whole is greater than a &s;mall Quantity of its Parts, or a Species of People more numerous than a few of its Individuals.</P>
<P>Thus then the Flame of our Incen&s;e is never pure and acceptable, or &s;ends forth a &s;weet Savour, but when it burns brightly, and unadulterated with &s;mouldering Smoke; which a faint Heat, or Lukewarmne&s;s, chiefly Occa&s;ions. Its Fewel too mu&s;t be la&s;ting and perma|nent; not apt to blaze out too fiercely, and after a tran&s;ient Violence expire, <HI>like Thorns under a Pot,</HI> as the P&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;es it. In &s;hort, we mu&s;t u&s;e the mo&s;t prudential Caution to &s;teer in the golden Medium between the Extremes of intemperate Fury, in a good Cau&s;e, and an almo&s;t creeping, grovelling, and &s;ordid In&s;en&s;ibility, on the other. While a Bigot in every light is odious; a meer moderate Lover of his Country (e&s;pecially when Danger threatens it ever &s;o remotely, and much more when it nearly approaches), is a mo&s;t dete&s;table and ridiculous Mon&s;ter. If we wou'd e&s;cape the Imputation of the former, we &s;hou'd meditate on the Words of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans:
<PB N="18" REF="007574_0015_102D7BEE9AFF31A0">I hear them Record, that they have a Zeal for GOD, but not according to Knowlege.</HI> Or if we wou'd not be &s;tigmatiz'd for being as de&s;picable as the latter, let us animadvert on what the Angel in the Revelations commands <HI>St. John</HI> to write to the Churches of <HI>Laodi|cea.&mdash;I know thy Works, that thou art neither cold, nor hot: I wou'd that thou wert either cold, or hot: So then becau&s;e thou art lakewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will &s;pue thee out of my Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>We live, alas! in an Age, when true public Spirit (by which I under&s;tand the mo&s;t elevated Species of the Zeal here prov'd a Chri&s;tian Duty), is very languid and defective; where too often, a Spirit of Faction, the very Rever&s;e of it, u&s;urps its Place, and arrogates with loud and awkward In&s;olence its &s;acred Form; but the &s;pecious Mask may be ea&s;ily &s;tripp'd off, and its native Deformity detected by a little more than ordinary In|&s;pection into its blu&s;tering Pretences and Ends of Ac|tion; which will be all found in a little Time to &s;pring from, or center in, &s;ome low, mercenary, and contract|ed View. We too frequently ob&s;erve it invidiou&s;ly ob|&s;tructing the Wheels of Government, and embroiling a State, where it is not admitted to an immediate Parti|cipation of Power: Indu&s;triou&s;ly watchful to detect and aggravate little Errors in an Admini&s;tration, for the Gratification of private Spleen and Revenge; employ|ing its clamourous Rhetoric to render it&s;elf of Con&s;e|quence; and pertinaciou&s;ly maintaining its Importance, by in&s;tilling Jealou&s;ies, &s;omenting Di&s;contents, and at|tracting popular Applau&s;e from the giddy <HI>Vulgar,</HI> great and &s;mall, with &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions and weak Brains.

The <HI>Rea&s;on of their Kings</HI> is publi&s;h'd from the Mouths of their Cannons; and where their Clergy &s;ail, Dragoons more powerfully convert.

<P>Under the public Provocations, which &s;ome virulent <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> perhaps encourag'd by the Proximity of the <HI>French,</HI> have lately given, though condemn'd by their le&s;s &s;anguine, and more di&s;creet Partizans, I do not wonder that we are <HI>generally,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> alarm'd: But I cou'd wi&s;h, that the &s;ole Object of the pre&s;ent &s;hort Se&s;&s;ion &s;hou'd be the nece&s;&s;ary Supply for ha&s;tening the Expedition, which ought not to be retarded by any other Avocation; for what is truly expedient may be &s;ometimes un&s;ea&s;onable, if it may be &s;afely po&s;tpon'd to a &s;ucceeding Opportunity of more deliberate Enquiry. Then without Cruelty to their Per&s;ons, or over&s;training the Laws, let us muzzle the <HI>Bear,</HI> or out off the <HI>Tyger</HI>'s Fangs, and take all &s;peedy, Parliamentary, and Chri&s;tian Methods for Self-Security. I am &s;atisfy'd there are &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic Gentlemen of Fortune and Family, both here and in <HI>England,</HI> who do not &s;wallow implicitly all the Impo|&s;itions of that Church, though they hold external Com|munion with it; and the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> with whom the Mi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Parts is &s;olely entru&s;ted, are too wi&s;ely indulgent not to come to a Sort of Compo&s;ition with

<P>O then, as you wou'd de&s;erve that glorious Appel|lation; as you are intimately concern'd in the Con&s;e|quences of the momentous Event, that has &s;ummon'd you now extraordinarily; as you are under the more peculiar Obligations of Honour, Tru&s;t, and Con&s;cience, to promote the Happine&s;s of the Community; of which you are not bare Members, but Rulers and Patrons: As you will an&s;wer it to your GOD; your King; your Young and Noble Proprietary; and your own Con&s;tituents: O permit not the Zeal of a true Public Spirit to cool in your Brea&s;ts; but on this, and all other, worthy Occa&s;ions, improve it in your&s;elves; kin|dle, encrea&s;e it in others; and tran&s;mit the hallow'd Principle to your Children's Children; to late&s;t Po&s;teri|ty; till only the Day of Judgment and the Kingdom of CHRIST put a Period to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominion in our <HI>New World;</HI> or till Time &s;hall be lo&s;t in Eter|nity!
