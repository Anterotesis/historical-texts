<HEAD>A DIALOGUE Between a <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Man and a <HI>Country</HI> Man.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bo&s;ton.</SPEAKER>
<P>WE are like to be involved under great difficulties and bondage by the Projecting Gentlemen of this Town.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Charge of Incorporating this Town will be very Great, in Tran&s;lating of it into a City, a Town, Pri&s;on and Keeper, a Bridewell, and keeper of Two Great Silver Ma&s;es, to be carryed before the Mayor, and two Men to carry them; and a Sword Bearer; a Clerk of the Court; a Clerk of the Market; a Recorder; a Chamberlain; and our Paying for our Freedom, that was Free-born and in bon|dage to no Man.</P>
<P N="2">2. That which is wor&s;t than all, is to the Trading part which is put under a po&s;&s;ibility of being reduced to manage but one Trade, which will be great Con|fu&s;ion, if not Un&s;upportable in its difficulties, <HI>viz.</HI> The Shop-keepers which do many of them occupy more than Twelve Trades; and the Handy crafts-men as many as their Genus and Stock do lead them to, without Interruption.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Laying us under difficulties with re&s;pect to our Provi&s;ion, in that it mu&s;t be brought into the Market, and there Pay dues and duties, and ob&s;erve our Cu&s;toms; which we believe they will not &s;o long as <HI>Charle&s;town</HI> and <HI>Rexbury</HI> do &s;tand.</P>
<P N="4">4. The taking away the Ancient Rights, and undoubted Property of our Voting at Town Meetings, which we now injoy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Country-man.</SPEAKER>
<P N="1">1. I Have heard &s;omething of this before. and it was re&s;ented to me to be for the Honour and Benefit of the Town, which I &s;hould be glad of, <HI>viz</HI> The Mayor and Aldermen mu&s;t be Men of con&s;iderable Sub|&s;tance in the World, which will be for the Honour of your Town: at the lea&s;t they mu&s;t be worth a 1000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="2">2. They will be able by this to Regulate your Town better than now it is, and to take Notice who comes into the Town; and to Let in or Keep out who they plea&s;e: for they hinder by your Charter all that will not Pay 5 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for their Freedom to the Mayor; and be al&s;o able to detect Vice, and to hinder &s;uch Out|tages as have broke out of late.</P>
<P N="3">3. I &s;hould be willing to hope that they will not lay you under tho&s;e difficulties with re&s;pect to the Trading Part of the Town, altho I confe&s;s it is in their Power to Reduce each Man in the Town to Occupy but one Trade.</P>
<P N="4">4. What if you lo&s;e your Priviledge of Voting, as long as you have Men in of Good E&s;tates, and undoubted Fidelity, for they take off the trouble from you.</P>
<P N="5">5. By this you reflect upon tho&s;e Gentlemen that Compo&s;ed your Charter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bo&s;ton An&s;wer</SPEAKER>
<P>I Alwayes ob&s;erved, That when any Great Project was in hand by a De|&s;igning and Projecting People, it was covered over with &s;ome plau&s;ible Story: If you look back no further than Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI>'s days. That the Church was in danger under the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, when in reality it was France was in dan|ger, and the Pretender was in danger: but Experience hath taught us, That the Church hath really been in danger ever &s;ince that Mini&s;try was turned out, until His Maje&s;ty King GEORGE came to the Crown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bo&s;ton.</SPEAKER>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall an&s;wer your Objections and leave it to your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="2">2. Object. <HI>You &s;ay they will be better able to Regulate your Town.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer:</HI> I do not like the Rule of Regulating of it, not the Qualifications of Mayor &amp; Aldermen; for a Man may be worth a 1000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and yet have neither Grace
<PB N="2" REF="039588_0002_10147C6326799C00">nor good Manner, but be a Coveteous, Man, that play <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> like a Wolfe among Sheep: An hone&s;t Man may not come into the Town without buying his Freedom, and if one never &s;o vile may his Freedom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">onde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> of 5 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to the Mayor: So now I think we have a much better way already, for a Man to give to the Town Security.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> I think you are mi&s;taken about that, this would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">ges that hath broken out of late, except it &s;hould give a Power of Devination whereby they &s;hould Divine or Tell who they are; for when we know who they are we have Power enough to detect them already.</P>
<P N="3">3. You &s;ay, You are willing to hope that by your being Incorporated, they will not lay the Trading part of the Town under &s;uch difficulties, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">o they have Power enough in their hands.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> You mi&s;take again, there is no grounds for you or us to hope &s;o, except you believe that Rich Coveteous Mayors will not love Money, not hone&s;t Mayors be bounded by the Oath of God, nor Town-Sericants willing to Serve Warrants, nor Coun&s;ollors willing to plead Ca&s;es. Furthermore, I can a&s;&s;ure you, That a Hatter in this Town which under&s;tands the Nature of a Corporation, I believe, better than tho&s;e Projecting Gentlemen did declare in my hearing, That if this Place was Incor|porated, they &s;hould have a good Trade (for from that day no Shop-keeper might Sell a Hat:) and further added, That there was &s;ome Shop-keeper did Sell more Hats than they, which was of the Trade.</P>
<P N="4">4. You &s;ay, What if your do lo&s;e your Power of Voting at Town Meeting, as long as you have Men in of Good E&s;tates and undoubted Fidelity, to take off the trouble from you.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Its hard to find them among&s;t us: but the common Maxim is, <HI>If you would have your work well done do it your&s;elf.</HI> I ob&s;erve in that great and la&s;t Speech of King WILLIAM, of Ble&s;&s;ed Memory, to His Parliament, He Exhorts them to hold the Ballance of <HI>Europe</HI> in their hands; therefore I conclude, we ought to be careful how we let go the Ballance out of our hands.</P>
<P N="5">5. You &s;ay, By this you reflect upon tho&s;e Gentlemen, even Thirty that Con&s;ul|ted and Compo&s;ed this Charter.</P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer,</HI> Tis true, and if Men will fi&s;h in &s;uch dirty Waters, and bring or endea|vour to bring on their Neighbours &s;uch Calamities, they ought not to think or take it hard to have dirt thrown in their Faces, for I &s;ee no ground to believe that they were free from Proud Spirits, and a de&s;ire from their Places to receive Greetings in the Market Places, and Coveteous, if not of finding the Philo&s;ophers Stone; yet to have a fellow-feeling of every bodies Pocket in the whole Town, and of being like to the Great Fi&s;h, of being lords over the Small, to make them to ob&s;erve their Mo|tions, and al&s;o in part to live upon them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Country Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for giving me &s;uch light with re&s;pect to the Bondage and Difficulties that as you &s;ay you are like to be brought under: I am of your Mind, and I would offer you &s;ome Advice, which if followed, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God may prove effectual.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be careful to bring up your North Nagatives,</P>
<P N="2">2. Be &s;ure that you choo&s;e a good Moderator.</P>
<P N="3">3. That for the future there &s;hall be no Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s brought into a Town. Meeting, except &s;uch &amp; &s;uch Things as your Town &s;hall think meet, or Warned for before, and having Voted, then your Town Clerk to Record it, which if you do, I doubt not but it will be for your good, and &s;o you may hold the Ballance with tho&s;e Projecting Gentlemen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bo&s;ton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for your good Advice; and do believe that its our concern to Ob&s;erve it; &s;eeing we have &s;o Noble a Hero to follow as KING GEORGE, which a&s;&s;ured His Council, <HI>That there is not One among them &s;hall more Earne&s;tly en|deavour the Pre&s;ervation of Property than My Self.</HI></P>
