brought them out, and &s;aid, Sirs, what mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> So that this Text tells and de&s;cribes to you, the Jaylor's Carriage when God fir&s;t &s;truck his Heart, and gave him a Sight of him&s;elf, and of his Sins; and in this Carriage of the Jaylor, there are the&s;e three Things very ob&s;ervable;</P>
<P>His Perplexity, his Courte&s;y, his Que&s;ti|on; his Perplexity, in <HI>Ver&s;.</HI> 29. His Cour|te&s;y and Que&s;tion, in <HI>Ver&s;.</HI> 30.</P>

<P>Secondly, His Courte&s;y, the Text &s;ays, <HI>he brought them out.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, His Que&s;tion; <HI>Sirs, what mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P>It is the fir&s;t of the&s;e I principally aim at, namely, the Jaylor's Perplexity, <HI>Than he called for a Light;</HI> Darkne&s;s now was a Terror to him, becau&s;e he was a Terror to him&s;elf, <HI>He was a Magor-Mi&s;&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ib, a Terror round about,</HI> Jer. 20 3. <HI>And he &s;prang in,</HI> that is, he ru&s;ht ha&s;tily into the Pri&s;on, and like a Man di&s;tracted, knew not what to do, nor which way to turn him&s;elf; <HI>he came trembling,</HI> being &s;trucken with inward Hor|ror and Terror of Con&s;cience; and pray ob&s;erve it well; there is not the &s;toute&s;t Man breathing upon Earth, but if God &s;et his Con&s;cience again&s;t him, like a Dog to fly in his Face, it will pull him down, and lay him flat, and fill him with that inward
<PB N="6" REF="004757_0004_100DE7E1B8236DF0">
Horror and Terror, and Perplexity, that he will be more afraid of him&s;elf, than of all the World be&s;ides. Thus it was with the Jaylor here, when God came nigh him, and awakened his Con&s;cience, <HI>he fell down be|fore Paul and Silas.</HI> God had given him a Sight of his Sins, and of the invi&s;ible Ma|je&s;ty of Chri&s;t, that was in tho&s;e his precious Servants, <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> whom before he lookt upon as a couple of Rogues, and that the Whip and the Stocks, were good enough for them, but now he reverenceth them, and re&s;pects them, and falls down at their Feet. Thus you &s;ee what his Perplexity was.</P>
<P>My Purpo&s;e is not to in&s;i&s;t upon every Particular, but to pitch upon that which is principally held forth in the Words; Ob|&s;erve therefore, when God was about to Work the great Work of &s;aving Faith, and &s;ound Conver&s;ion in the Heart of this Jay|lor, and by Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to bring him to Salvation, what is the fir&s;t Thing that he does? Fir&s;t he humbles him, and &s;trikes him down, and lays him flat, he doth awaken and &s;hake his Con&s;cience; this un|broken Sinner is now amazed, and perplex|ed, and a&s;toni&s;hed, and he knows not which way to turn him&s;elf. So then the Ob&s;er|vation I would commend to you from the Words, is this:</P>

<P><HI>Sound Humiliation is a nece&s;&s;ary Antecedent or fore-runner to Faith and Salvation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004757_0004_100DE7E1B8236DF0">Would you have it plainer? then take it thus,</P>
<P><HI>Tho&s;e whom God intends to make true Be|lievers and Heirs of his everla&s;ting King|dom, they are fir&s;t &s;oundly humbled, and made &s;en&s;ible of their own dangerous and damnable Condition.</HI></P>
<P>Look as a Timber-Tree, that a Man in|tends for Building, fir&s;t he hews it down, and then he fits it, and &s;quares it for the Building; &s;o that Sinner whom God in|tends to frame for him&s;elf, and build up by Faith to Salvation, God fir&s;t ca&s;ts down to the Ground, and lays him flat, and makes him &s;en&s;ible of his own lo&s;t and dangerous, and damnable E&s;tate: Look into the Scrip|ture, and you &s;hall find that is God's Me|thod, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t's Method, and the Holy Gho&s;t's.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, This is God's Method, and this Cour&s;e he took with our fir&s;t Parents, he arraigned them, and pa&s;t a Sentence upon them, and pronounced a Cur&s;e again&s;t them, before ever he brings them to the Knowledge of a Saviour, before ever he made that Promi&s;e, that <HI>The Seed of the Woman &s;hould break the Serpents Head.</HI> Re|markable is that Scripture, <HI>Job.</HI> 33.21, 22. it de&s;cribes the Manner of God's converting a Sinner, <HI>Ver</HI> 14 <HI>God &s;peaketh once, ye twice, yet Man perceiveth it not.</HI> God calls, and cries, and knocks, and tries this Way, and
<PB N="8" REF="004757_0005_100DE7E34032D3B8">
that Way, and the other Way, to bring the Sinner in, to bring him home by Conver&s;ion, but all will not do; what doth he then? Read <HI>Ver&s;.</HI> 21, 22. God humb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the Sin|ner to the very Du&s;t, <HI>His Fle&s;h is con&s;umed away that it cannot be &s;een and his Bones that were not &s;een &s;tick out, his Soul draweth near unto the Grave, and his Life to the De&s;troyers.</HI> His meaning is this, he is made a very Anatomy, and God brings him to the very Gates of Hell, and what follows, <HI>Then he is gracious unto him, and &s;aith, deliver him from going down to the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, I have found a Ran&s;om.</HI></P>
<P>So this was the Method of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, this Cour&s;e he took with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> before he was Converted, he unhor&s;t him, and humbled him, and &s;truck him blind, and all this while St. <HI>Paul</HI> mu&s;t &s;teep in Sorrow, before <HI>Ananias</HI> comes to him, and &s;peak Words of Comfort, <HI>Acts</HI> 9 Chri&s;t would have us <HI>weary and heavy Laden.</HI> Matth. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> weary with the Work of Sin, and heavy laden with the Weight of Sin, before he will give us Ea&s;e; he will have the Soul thir&s;ty, before he gives it the Water of Life. I&s;a. 55.1. <HI>Ho, every one that Thir&s;teth, came ye to the Waters;</HI> that is, to be &s;en&s;ible of the want of Chri&s;t, and the worth of Chri&s;t, before he gives the Soul to ta&s;te of the Waters of Life; and he will have the Soul &s;ick of Sin, before the Phy&s;ician comes to it, <HI>The whole have no need of a Phy&s;ician, but they that

are &s;ick,</HI> Math. 9.12. He will have the Sinner &s;ick of his Sin, before he will cure him.</P>
<P>And this is the Holy Gho&s;t's Method too; for you &s;hall read the Spirit of God, Fir&s;t <HI>convinceth of Sin, before he convinceth of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> John 16 8. Fir&s;t, The Spirit of God convinceth of Sin for Humiliation, before he convinceth of Righteou&s;ne&s;s for Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>And this hath been the Method of all Ma&s;ter-Builders. <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> he comes levelling of Mountains, and ca&s;ting down proud Sinners before they come to Chri&s;t; and St. <HI>Peter,</HI> he prickt his Hearers to the Heart, before he gave them any Hope or Comfort by a Saviour, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. He let them Blood at the Heart before he directed them how to be &s;aved. But now, becau&s;e this is a weighty Truth, and it may plea&s;e God to do good to &s;ome of you all the Days of your Lives, to know the Method and Man|ner of bringing Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the Soul together, (for this is all the Work we Mi|ni&s;ters have to do,) let me &s;peak to it by way of Explication, and &s;hew you three Things.</P>

<P>The pa&s;&s;ive Humiliation, is that whereby God humbles the Sinner, in the fir&s;t Work of his Conver&s;ion; and it is called <HI>a pa&s;&s;ive Humiliation,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecau&s;e the Sinner is wholly <HI>pa&s;&s;ive,</HI> and doth nothing at all conducing to his Conver&s;ion; and of this the Text &s;peaks of.</P>

<PB N="11" REF="004757_0006_100DE7E50E6ADF48">
again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</HI> Why is it called the Spirit of Bondage? Not becau&s;e the Spirit of God brings the Soul into Bondage, for the Spirit of God is a free Spirit, P&s;al. 51 12. <HI>Uphold me with thy free Spirit; and where the Spirit of God is, there is Liberty.</HI> But he is called a Spirit of Bondage, becau&s;e he di&s;covers to us our Bondage, and lets the Sinner &s;ee the Bondage and Slavery wherein he is mi&s;erably captivated under Sin and Satan. A Man, before the Work of Conver&s;ion is wrought, thinks him&s;elf a Free-Man; <HI>We are Abraham's Seed, and were never in Bondage to any, how &s;aye&s;t thou we &s;hall be made free?</HI> John 8 33. But now the Spirit of God comes, and lets a Man &s;ee him&s;elf in the Gla&s;s of God's Law, whereby he di&s;covers Sin to be out of Mea&s;ure &s;in|ful; and it lets him &s;ee him&s;elf in the Gla&s;s of Con&s;cience, and &s;o comes to the Sinner, and &s;ays to him, ju&s;t as <HI>Nathan</HI> did to <HI>Da|vid, Thou art the Man,</HI> thou art he that lyeth under the Guilt of Sin, and under the Wrath of God, and under the Condemna|tion of the &s;econd Death; therefore look to it. When the Spirit of God lets a Man &s;ee him&s;elf, and his Bondage, and that State of Woe and Mi&s;ery in which he is, now he confe&s;&s;eth he is in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s, and in the Bond of Iniquity. Again, I &s;ay in the De&s;cription of it, that <HI>the poor Sinner
<PB N="12" REF="004757_0007_100DE7E76D08B790">
is &s;tricken with the &s;en&s;e of his Sin, and with the fear of Wrath.</HI> Before a Man is hum|bled, he is ju&s;t like a Man in a dead Sleep, in a drunken Sleep, he hears not, he fears not, he feels not; like the Drunkard that <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;peaks of, Prov. 23.34, 35 <HI>Yea, thou &s;halt be as he that lyeth down in the mid&s;t of the Sea, or as he that lyeth upon the top of a Ma&s;t; they have &s;tricken me, &s;halt thou &s;ay, and I was not &s;ick, they have beaten me, and I felt it not; when I &s;hall awake, I will &s;eek it yet again.</HI> But when once the Spirit of God comes to &s;trike the Sinner to the Purpo&s;e, now Sin is revived, and Con&s;cience awakened and convicted, as the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, <HI>I was alive once without the Law,</HI> alive in my own Appre|hen&s;ion, alive without the &s;piritual Know|ledge of the Law; <HI>but Sin revived, and I died,</HI> Rom. 7.9. Then the Law &s;hewed me I was but a dead Man; O, Con&s;cience now began to be awaked, and convicted. Sen&s;e of Sin brings with it a fear of Wrath, and hence it is, that the Spirit of Bondage is called a Spirit of Fear. 2 Tim. 1.7. <HI>For, God hath not given us the Spirit of Fear, but of Power, of Love, and of a &s;ound Mind</HI> And this Fear doth awaken a Man, and leave &s;ome kind of Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Spirit of a Man, &s;o that he is awakened, and looks out for Help out of him&s;elf Again. I &s;ay <HI>A Sinner thus &s;tricken with the Sen&s;e of his Sin, flies out of him&s;elf, and flies to Je&s;us
<PB N="13" REF="004757_0007_100DE7E76D08B790">
Chri&s;t;</HI> That is, he de&s;pairs of all Hope, and Help in him&s;elf: I dare &s;ay, he was never a true believing Sinner, that was not a de&s;pairing Sinner; under&s;tand me thus, there is a religious-de&s;peration, as well as a damning-de&s;peration; I &s;ay, a Sinner that is &s;tricken with the Sen&s;e of his Sins, de&s;pairs of Help in him&s;elf; this is an holy De&s;pair, whereby a Man renounceth all Hope of Help in him&s;elf, and flies to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This is a certain Rule, the le&s;s a Man tru&s;ts in him&s;elf, the more he tru&s;ts in a Saviour. That's the fir&s;t Thing, What this Humilia|tion is?</P>
<P>A &s;econd Que&s;tion to be &s;atisfied is this, <HI>Whether the like Mea&s;ure of Humiliation be wrought in all tho&s;e that are brought home to Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, No, &s;ome have more, and &s;ome have le&s;s, according to the different Tem|pers of Men's Spirits: &s;ome Men are more froward, and &s;ome are more ingenious; tho&s;e that are openly prophane, &s;tout, &s;tub|born Sinners, they u&s;ually have a great Mea&s;ure of Humiliation, but now tho&s;e that are more flexible, have a le&s;s Mea&s;ure of Humiliation; to the fir&s;t, God comes like a mighty ru&s;hing Wind, to the &s;econd Sort, he comes like a &s;till Wind, in a more mild and melting Way; &s;ometimes God breaks in upon the Sinner's Heart with open vio|lence, as he did upon St. <HI>Paul,</HI> when he was &s;mitten down to the Ground, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.
<PB N="14" REF="004757_0008_100DE7E96DE0DF80">
Sometimes again God opens the Heart without any Noi&s;e, as he did the Heart of <HI>Lydia, Acts</HI> 16 Sometimes God &s;uffers a Sinner to lie long under the Spirit of Bon|dage, tho&s;e e&s;pecially that he hath appointed for &s;ome &s;pecial U&s;e and Service to him&s;elf; as the Timber that is appointed for &s;ome &s;pecial Service, lies long a &s;oaking, before it be made U&s;e of. Sometimes again Sin|ners are &s;et free from legal Terrors &s;ud|denly; now this is the lea&s;t Mea&s;ure of Humiliation, wrought in tho&s;e that are brought home to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to make Sin odious, and loath&s;ome to a Man, and to make a Man fly out of him&s;elf to Je&s;us Chri&s;t There is a twofold pa&s;&s;ive Humi|liation.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>A Legal Humiliation.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>An Evangelical Humiliation.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The legal Humiliation is that which con|&s;i&s;ts in legal Terror, and fear of Wrath, and the Sen&s;e of God's Wrath, and Horror of Con&s;cience, and Fear of Hell-Fire.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There is an evangelical Humili|ation, and that con&s;i&s;ts in the Operation of God's ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, convincing a Man of Sin; thus the Spirit of God convinceth the Sinner, and by convincing him, empties him of him&s;elf, and by emptying him fits him for a Saviour. Legal Humiliation, <HI>(pray mark)</HI> though it makes a greater Noi&s;e, yet it is not always ab&s;olutely need|ful for all Per&s;ons, which I prove thus
<PB N="15" REF="004757_0008_100DE7E96DE0DF80">
It is not a Grace, becau&s;e a Man can never have too much Grace, and a Man may have too much legal Humiliation. Again, &s;ome Reprobates have had a great Mea&s;ure of legal Humiliation, and yet have peri&s;hed; and &s;ome that have been converted have had but a little Mea&s;ure of legal Humilia|tion, and yet have been &s;aved. I &s;ay, legal Humiliation, though it makes a great Noi&s;e, is not ab&s;olutely needful: But evangelical Humiliation, though it makes a le&s;s Noi&s;e, this is ab&s;olutely needful to every Per&s;on, becau&s;e this drives a Sinner out of him&s;elf, and cau&s;eth him to fly to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in a mild and melting Way, making him, <HI>to look on him whom he hath pierced, and to mourn for his Sin, as he that mourns for the lo&s;s of his only Son that &s;erves him.</HI></P>

<PB N="17" REF="004757_0009_100DE7ECA6461C68">
the&s;e are the two great Attributes that God will have magnified in the Conver&s;ion of a Sinner. The Ju&s;tice of God is acknow|ledged, when the Sinner falls down at the Feet of God, and &s;aith, <HI>Lord, again&s;t thee, again&s;t thee have I &s;inned, and done this Evil in thy Sight, that thou mighte&s;t be ju&s;tified when thou &s;peake&s;t, and clear when that judge&s;t</HI> P&s;al. 51.4 And the Mercy of God is wonderfully magnified, when he hangs out a white Flag of Pardon, after all the Sinner's Rebellions and Provocations, O now, Mercy is Mercy indeed! As a King, when he is about to Pardon a Traitor, he &s;uffers him to be brought to the Place of Execution, and to have the Rope about his Neck, and the Hankerchief drawn over his Face; O how welcome is a Pardon then to that Traitor!

<P>Thirdly, It is fitting in re&s;pecT of <HI>others,</HI> that they may not &s;peak reproachfully of God, and the Ways of God. If &s;o be a Sinner could in&s;tantly &s;tep out of an Ale-Hou&s;e to Chri&s;t, or out of a Whore-Hou&s;e to Chri&s;t; if there were no more required to get to Chri&s;t, than the putting of Meat out of one Di&s;h into another, carnal Men would be ready to have very low Thoughts of God, that he is &s;uch a one as them&s;elves, that he doth patronize and approve their wicked Cour&s;es; but God will have the Mouth of Iniquity &s;topt, and carnal Men them&s;elves acknowledge, that the Ways of God are equal.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary that the Soul be humbled. I &s;hall give you the&s;e five Rea|&s;ons of the nece&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of it.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Becau&s;e without this Humiliation, the Sinner can never highly prize God. To an unhumbled Sinner, Chri&s;t is no more e&s;teemed (with reverence be is &s;poken) than the Dirt under his Feet, Acts 4 11.
<PB N="19" REF="004757_0010_100DE7EEF8EC6EF8">
<HI>This is the Stone which was &s;et at nought by you Builders;</HI> they made no reckoning of Chri&s;t at all.

Gal, 3.24 The Truth is, the Soul will never run to Chri&s;t to the Purpo&s;e, until it be whipt by this School-Ma&s;ter. You know the Story of the City of Refuge, the Man &s;layer never fled thither, until the Avenger of Blood pur&s;ued him. The City of Refuge is Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Sinner never flies to Je&s;us Chri&s;t to Purpo&s;e, until the Vengeance of a Sin-revenging God, and the Cur&s;e of a condemning Law, and the Horror of a &s;elf-accu&s;ing Con&s;cience, pur&s;ue the Soul like a cha&s;ed Deer; now it flies to Je&s;us Chri&s;t to Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Without Humiliation the Sinner will never obey Chri&s;t; an unbroken Sin|ner is like an unbroken Colt, that is not tamed, or like an unbroken Hei&s;er that will not &s;ubmit to the Yoke; Je&s;us Chri&s;t may command what he will, but he will do what he li&s;ts.

I was a &s;hamed yea even confounded.</HI> Now in the 20. <HI>Ver&s;.</HI> you have God bemoaning <HI>Ephraim, Is Ephraim my dear Son? Is he a plea&s;ant Child? For &s;ince I &s;poke again&s;t him, I do earne&s;tly remember him &s;till; there|fore my Bowels are troubled for him, I will &s;urely have Mercy upon him, &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Do but con&s;ider, That this is the ordinary way that God leads Men to Mercy by; God u&s;ually condemns before he ju&s;tifies, he breaks before he binds up, he pulls down before he builds. <HI>There is a Time to pull down, and a Time to build up,</HI> Eccl. 3.3. That may be applied Pur|po&s;e;
<PB N="30" REF="004757_0016_100DE80118D22428">
this is, I &s;ay, God's ordinary Way; and would you have him to go out of his u&s;ual Cour&s;e and Way? If one of you &s;hould &s;ay to your Neighbour, Let me come in at your Window, or break down your Wall, and then I will come in and vi&s;it you; what An&s;wer (think you) would he make? If you do not come in at the Door, the ordinary Way, do not come in to me.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may &s;ay. <HI>What will you have us to do? Are we able to humble our&s;elves? True indeed, when God hath fir&s;t humbled us, then we are able to humble our&s;elves; but you told us even now, in the fir&s;t Work of Conver|&s;ion, we are meerly pa&s;&s;ive, we can do nothing towards our Humiliation, it is the Work of the Spirit of God; you have now preach'd free-will to us.</HI></P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, True indeed, in a State of Nature, we can do nothing that may plea&s;e God, we cannot &s;et one Foot forwards in the way to Heaven; but yet let me tell you, There is never an unconverted Sinner but may do a great deal more than he doth, therefore I put you upon doing no more than you your&s;elves can do, and that in the&s;e five Particulars, which I &s;hall &s;peak a little to, and then have done.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Though you cannot humble your|&s;elves in a State of Unregeneracy, yet you may &s;uffer another to do it for you, you may &s;uffer it to be done. A Man for Example, that is to be cut of the Stone, though he

You may &s;uffer the Word of <HI>Exhortation</HI> which is tendred to you; when God wounds you by the Word, you may keep the Wound open: Carnal Men, when the Word hath wounded them, they lick them&s;elves whole by carnal Coun&s;els, and carnal Company, and carnal Rea&s;onings; O what a &s;tir do Men make to &s;hake out the Arrow of Conviction, re&s;i&s;ting the Spirit of God that is &s;tirring in the Mini&s;try of the Word upon their Hearts! How many are there that come in Armour to Church, they come in their Coat of Male! How many harden their Necks, that the Word cannot pierce them! Now this you mu&s;t not do, you mu&s;t &s;uffer the Word to riffle and ran|&s;ack your Hearts, let the Word &s;mite you, as he &s;aid, P&s;al. 141 5 <HI>Let the Righteous &s;mite me.</HI> Let the Word break my Head, or Heart, &s;o it may but work upon my Soul.

There is a Story of a Man that read in a Book every Day that had three Leaves, a white Leaf, a red Leaf, a black Leaf; the white Leaf of the Book, that was the Joys of Heaven, the red Leaf, that was the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the black Leaf, that was the Torments of Hell; you may look into Hell by Contemplation, and Meditation, that you may prevent Hell to all Eternity; you may medi|tate upon the Blood of Chri&s;t, and &s;leep as it were

<P>Thirdly, A third Thing you can do, you can Sor|row more, and Mourn more than you do: There is none of you but can Sorrow and Mourn for out|ward Lo&s;&s;es; lo&s;s of Friends, as Husband, &amp; Wife, or Child, perhaps for the lo&s;s of a Hor&s;e; what can&s;t thou Mourn for the lo&s;s of a Child, and can&s;t thou not mourn for the lo&s;s of a Soul, when one Soul is worth all the Kingdoms in the World? If any of you have lo&s;t a good Bargain, or mi&s;t a good Market, you can grieve for this; O methinks you &s;hould mourn for this, how many Market-Days have I lo&s;t for my Soul; I have burnt out many a precious Light, &amp; &s;pent out my precious Time; and can you not Mourn for the lo&s;s of such a Bargain as this is? Suppo&s;e one of you &s;hould be &s;ent for before a mighty Monarch, and &s;hould be impeacht of high Trea&s;on before him; how would you trem|ble to appear before &s;o mighty a King, that hath Power in his Hands to cut you off In&s;tantly! O you and I mu&s;t appear before the great Judge of Hea|ven and Earth, the King of Kings, that knows all the Sins and Trea&s;ons that ever we have commit|ted; and you &s;hould ble&s;s God if you are ca&s;t into Fear, and thereby be brought to mourn, &amp; grieve, and &s;orrow for your Sins. Job 23.16 <HI>For God maketh my Heart &s;oft, and the Almighty troubleth me;</HI> that is, &s;oft by troubling of me.</P>
<P>Fourthly, There is never a one of you, but may leave gro&s;s and &s;candalous Sins, which I prove thus; You can do it for fear of Men, and you may do it much more for fear of God A prophane Swearer, if he be in the Company of a goldly gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e

An Adulterer, if a Boy be but in the Room of &s;even years old, he will forbear to act his Uncleanne&s;s, until the Boy be out of the Room. If you can forbear gro&s;s Sins for fear of Men, much more can you do it for fear of God. If a Boy can &s;ay his Le&s;&s;on with a Rod, certainly he can do it without a Rod; if you can ab&s;tain from gro&s;s Sins for fear, certainly you can do it without.

<P>Fifthly, Though it is true, a Man in a State of Nature is dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es &amp; Sins, yet then, at that Time, he may do many g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od Works, Works morally good, Works ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y good, he may Fa&s;t, and Pray, and give Alms; therefore it is that <HI>Daniel</HI> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ks to <HI>Nebuchadnezzar.
