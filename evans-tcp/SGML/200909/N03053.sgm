<HEAD>A LETTER FROM A Mini&s;ter of the <HI>Church of England</HI> to his di&s;&s;enting Pari&s;hioners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear, tho' mi&s;taken Brethren;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>_MY Hearts De&s;ire and Prayer to God for you and yours,</HI> is, <HI>That you might be &s;aved:</HI> This likewi&s;e has been, and is my earne&s;t and con&s;tant Endea|vour; for your Souls are very preci|ous, for whom our dear Redeemer &s;pilt his preci|ous Blood. I am &s;orry you will not give me more Opportunity to &s;erve the Intere&s;t of your Souls, which I &s;hould gladly do with all my Heart: But you are taught to keep at a Di&s;tance from me,
<PB N="4" REF="003672_0003_1002412F9BFE36C8">
and beware of my Conver&s;ation: And all ima|ginable Pains have been taken to frighten you from coming within the Doors of the Church, which, at lea&s;t, is directly contrary to the Apo|&s;tle's Advice, 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.21. <HI>Prove all Things and hold fa&s;t that wich is good.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, becau&s;e you will not give me Opportunity to promote the &s;piritual Good of your Souls, neither at my Habitation, nor at the Hou&s;e of God, I have taken this method to wait upon you at your own, and I hope you will not &s;hut your Eyes again&s;t the Light, or be &s;o preju|diced again&s;t the Title of this Paper, as not to read it carefully, and con&s;ider it &s;eriou&s;ly and impar|tially.</P>
<P><HI>I BEAR you Record, that you have a Zeal for God, but not according to Knowledge, Rom.</HI> 10 2. You are, many of you, &s;eriou&s;ly and religi|ou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, and heartily concerned to be &s;av|ed; but, give me Leave to &s;ay, you are unhap|pily mi&s;taken and mi&s;led in &s;undry weighty Mat|ters of Religion. Did you rightly under&s;tand the true State of Things, did you really know the true Principles of our Church, and how exactly a|greeable her Doctrine, Di&s;cipline and Government are to the holy Scriptures, and the true primitive Church, as founded by the Apo&s;tles, I &s;ay, did you under&s;tand things as they really are, you would immediately fly into her Bo&s;om, as into the Ark, and not be contented a Day out of our Communion.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003672_0004_100241312591D028">BUT the Truth is, there are &s;o many Fal&s;|hoods and Slanders indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread about, to ca&s;t Di&s;grace on the Church, that, no wonder you are frighted from her, and afraid to be concerned with her; for it would indeed deeply grieve any&punc; indifferent, &s;erious and con&s;iderate Per&s;on, to hear what injurious Mi&s;-repre&s;entations, evil Re|ports and groundle&s;s Reproaches &s;he &s;uffers from &s;ome who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, may our <HI>Heavenly Father forgive them,</HI> and grant them better Minds, <HI>for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I will ob&s;erve to you in particular &s;un|dry fal&s;e and groundle&s;s Stories, which you are made to believe concerning the <HI>Church of Eng|land,</HI> by which you may &s;ee how wickedly you are impo&s;ed on and we abu&s;ed.</P>
<P N="1">1. SOME of the wicked Books &s;cattered about among you, would per&s;wade you, <HI>That our Church is little better than</HI> Popery, <HI>and &s;ymbolizes with the Church of</HI> Rome.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> NOTHING can be more fal&s;e and abu&s;ive than this: For tho&s;e who fir&s;t laid the Foundation of our Church, burnt at the Stake be|cau&s;e they could not comply with Popery. And never did any Writers &s;o effectually confute <HI>Po|pery</HI> as ours have, and we have as much Zeal a|gain&s;t and Hatred to <HI>Popery</HI> as you can have: Nay, if you would give me Opportunity, I could make it appear, That &s;ome of your Principles are nearer a Kin to <HI>Popery</HI> than any of ours, and that there is nothing peculiarly taught or practi&s;ed in the
<PB N="6" REF="003672_0005_1002413394ECEB18">
<HI>Church of England,</HI> but was taught and practi&s;ed in the Church long before <HI>Popery</HI> was heard of in the World. Do we deny you the Scriptures or public Wor&s;hip in your own Language? Do we wor&s;hip Images, or pray to Saints or Angels? Do we teach Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, or deny the Cup to the Laity? Do we teach the Popes Supremacy or Infallibility, or Pray Souls out of Purgatory? The&s;e and the like are the Ab&s;urdities of <HI>Popery,</HI> which our Church abhors as much as you can do: So that your <HI>Delaune</HI> and the re&s;t of them are a|bominably injurious to us, in endeavouring to fa&s;ten <HI>Popery</HI> upon us, and by the &s;ame Rea&s;ons they might as well charge it upon you: For thus he argues; <HI>The Church of</HI> England <HI>u&s;e the</HI> Te Deum, <HI>the Re&s;pon&s;es, &amp;c. &s;o do the Church of</HI> Rome. Nay, he goes on, and &s;ays, <HI>The Church of</HI> England <HI>u&s;e the Apo&s;tles Creed, the Lords Prayer and Ten Commandments, and the P&s;alms of</HI> David, <HI>and &s;o does the Church of</HI> Rome. Does this prove them to be <HI>Popery?</HI> Why ju&s;t as much as it proves the two Sacraments to be <HI>Popery.</HI> And indeed he did hold Infant Bapti&s;m and Sprinkling to be <HI>Popery</HI> as much as any Thing el&s;e in the Church of <HI>England:</HI> And therefore his Argu|ments do as much Prove you to be <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> as us.</P>
<P>YOU are told, <HI>Our Church is a per&s;ecuting bloodthir&s;ty Church.</HI> I an&s;wer. This is a mo&s;t a|bu&s;ive In&s;inuation; for it is ea&s;y to prove, that the <HI>Church of England</HI> never &s;hed a Drop of any Mans Blood in the World for his Religion.
<PB N="7" REF="003672_0006_10024135ED24B788">
It is true the civil Goverment hath &s;ometimes impri&s;oned and fined Per&s;ons for &s;editious Practi|ces, who pretended Zeal for Religion in what they did: But you are the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable People in the World, to talk of Per&s;ecution at this Time of Day, when you know that you have for almo&s;t 50 Years enjoyed a free Liberty and uninterrupted Tolleration. But if you are for looking back, remember <HI>the ble&s;&s;ed Days</HI> (as &s;ome of you call them) <HI>of Oliver Cromwell,</HI> when the Di&s;&s;enters were uppermo&s;t, and the Church was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and her Clergy &s;eque&s;tred, plundred, impri&s;oned and barbarou&s;ly treated, and forbid to perform the lea&s;t Part of their Office. Or if you are for looking into <HI>Scotland,</HI> don't forget how barbarou&s;ly the Epi&s;copal Clergy were turned out of Doors and per&s;ecuted, when the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> got the Upperhand: In&s;tances the&s;e are enough to &s;hut your Mouths, if you had any Mode&s;ty: However I have nothing to &s;ay for Per&s;ecution, I abhor it as much as you do; only I would &s;ug|ge&s;t, that we of the <HI>Church of England</HI> here have but too much Rea&s;on to apprehend, from &s;undry In&s;tances of the &s;evere oppre&s;&s;ive Treatment we have met with from &s;ame of you, that if we were in your Power, there are not a few would per&s;e|cute us, at lea&s;t as much as ever any Di&s;&s;enters were per&s;ecuted in the World.</P>
<P>SOME have been &s;o ridiculous as to try to make you believe, <HI>That the Martyrs in Queen</HI> Mary<HI>'s Days (and particularly</HI> John Rogers) <HI>were
<PB N="8" REF="003672_0007_100241384C2D14A8">
Pre&s;byterians.</HI> I an&s;wer, That nothing can be a more ab&s;urd or fal&s;e Pretence than this; for it is certain and can be ea&s;ily made to appear that &s;ome of tho&s;e who were burnt at the Stake at that Time, were the very Men that compo&s;ed our Prayer-Book, and &s;ealed their Religion with their Blood, and they all &s;uffered long before the Pre&s;byterians were heard of in <HI>England.</HI> And this puts me in mind to ob&s;erve to you, how wickedly &s;ome im|po&s;e upon you, in making you believe, <HI>That we of the Church in this Country are not true Church|men, &s;uch as they are in</HI> England, <HI>and &s;uch as they were from the Beginning of the Reformation.</HI> Now this is a mo&s;t injurious Slander; for we u&s;e con|&s;tantly tho&s;e very &s;ame Prayers now as were com|po&s;ed by tho&s;e old holy Martyrs, and the very &s;ame Service here as they do in <HI>England,</HI> Word for Word, without the lea&s;t Variation: But it is in&s;upportably abu&s;ive in any of you, as &s;ome do, to charge us with being <HI>High-flyers</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> when you know in your Con&s;ciences, that we con&s;tantly pray for our mo&s;t Gracious Sovereign King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> and &s;teddily practice and preach up a &s;incere Attachment to his Per&s;on and Go|vernment. And I challenge you to produce an In&s;tance of any one Per&s;on in the&s;e Parts, that ever mentioned the Pretenders Name but with Abhorrence.</P>
<P>SOME of the wicked Books among you would per&s;wade you, <HI>That our Church places all Religion in mere outward Ceremonies, and holds no
<PB N="9" REF="003672_0008_1002413AC9167A20">
Regeneration but Bapti&s;m, no Nece&s;&s;ity of the in|ward Work of the Spirit, &amp;c.</HI> I an&s;wer, this is all ab&s;olutely fal&s;e: For tho' we hold the great Expediency of outward Rites and Ob&s;ervances for Unity and Uniformity, for Decency and Order in the Wor&s;hip of God; yet we don't place all Reli|gion in them: On the contrary, we hold that all outward Performances without an inward Change of Heart and a good Life, are of no Account with God. 'Tis true, we call Bapti&s;m <HI>External Rege|neration,</HI> according to St. <HI>Paul, Tit.</HI> 3.5. who there calls it <HI>the Wa&s;hing of Regeneration;</HI> but we deny, that Bapti&s;m alone can &s;ave us without the inward Regeneration wrought in us, by the mighty Power of the Spirit of God: So that the&s;e vile Books do mo&s;t fal&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ent and wick|edly abu&s;e us, and we wi&s;h you therefore to con|&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, how little tho&s;e are to be believed or regarded, who &s;pread &s;uch fal&s;e and &s;candalous Books among you, to impo&s;e upon you.</P>
<P N="5">5. YOU are told, <HI>That we don't hold the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Conver&s;ion and real Goodne&s;s, to qualify us for the Sacrament, and that we receive all with|out Di&s;tinction.</HI> I an&s;wer the direct contrary to this is true; for tho' our Charity is larger than yours, yet we hold the &s;ame Qualifications nece&s;|&s;ary as you do: This appears to any one that will read our <HI>Exhortations to the Communion.</HI> We hold no Man can come acceptably without Faith, Repentance and new Obedience, whereas &s;ome of your Teachers hold the Sacrament a convert|ing
<PB N="10" REF="003672_0009_1002413CA85FB180">
Ordinance, which the Writers of our Church deny.</P>
<P N="6">6. Some would per&s;wade you, <HI>That we take upon us to forgive Sins;</HI> whereas we only declare Gods Forgivene&s;s to all true Penitents. And <HI>That we pray for the Dead,</HI> for this wi&s;e Rea&s;on for|&s;ooth, becau&s;e we pray <HI>That God would not re|member again&s;t us our Iniquities, nor the Iniquities of our fore-Fathers.</HI> Can it be that People would di&s;pute &s;uch Things as the&s;e, were it not purely for Di&s;puting &s;ake, or di&s;&s;ent for &s;uch Rea&s;ons, unle&s;s meerly for Di&s;&s;enting &s;ake? Surely they de&s;erve no Reply but that of Pity for poor igno|rant People that are impo&s;ed upon by them, and for the poor trifling Di&s;puters that by &s;uch means impo&s;e upon them.</P>
<P>MANY Things are objected again&s;t us as &s;u|per&s;titious, &s;uch as the <HI>Surplice, God-Fathers and God-Mothers in Bapti&s;m,</HI> and <HI>the Cro&s;s after it,</HI> and <HI>the Holy Days,</HI> and the like. I put the&s;e things together for brevily becau&s;e I would make the quicker di&s;patch. And I an&s;wer in the fir&s;t Place, There are very wi&s;e and good Rea&s;ons for the propriety decency and expediency of the&s;e Practices; particularly, as to the <HI>Surplice.</HI> What can be more proper, than to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;acred Services by a peculiar Garment, for which we have the Example of God him&s;elf in the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, which, tho' not binding upon Chri|&s;tians, may be a good Precedent to them, in ap|pointing what is decent in publick Wor&s;hip:
<PB N="11" REF="003672_0010_1002413F14406708">
Thus in <HI>Ezekiel</HI> 44 17, it is ordered, <HI>That when they come to mini&s;ter in the inner Court, they &s;hall be cloathed with linnen Garments:</HI> To which it is very likely St. <HI>John</HI> alludes, in <HI>Rev.</HI> 19 8, even in Go&s;pel Times, when the Church <HI>&s;hould be ar|rayed in fine Linnen, clean and white, for the fine Linnen is</HI> [the Emblem of] <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Saints.</HI> I don't offer the&s;e as Scripture Evidences of the Nece&s;&s;ity, but of the Lawfulne&s;s, Propriety and Significancy of this Appointment. And how mean a Thing is it, and how de&s;picable a Weak|ne&s;s, to di&s;pute and contend about or take Offence at the Matter, Colour or Shape of a Garment? It betrays a Littlene&s;s of Mind, and a mean Nar|rowne&s;s of Soul. And then as to <HI>God-Fathers</HI> and <HI>God-Mothers,</HI> or <HI>Spon&s;ors in Bapti&s;m,</HI> what can be more proper or expedient, when a Child is ad|mitted into Covenant by Bapti&s;m, than that &s;ince the Child cannot an&s;wer for it &s;elf, &s;ome Body &s;hould an&s;wer its Part in the Covenant, in its Name? and that there &s;hould be double Security for its Chri&s;tian Education? You don't think it unrea&s;onable in your temporal Affairs, to have Bondsmen joyntly engaged with the Per&s;on im|mediately concerned in paying of Money; and can it then be thought improper, that there &s;hould be the like double Security in&s;i&s;ted upon for this more important Matter, the Chri&s;tian Education of a Child, in Ca&s;e of Mortality, Po|verty, or any other Inability or Want of Duty in the Parents? And as to the <HI>Sign of the Cro&s;s;</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="003672_0011_100241427A0FCCD0">
what can he more proper or &s;ignificant, after a Child is <HI>baptized into the Faith of a Crucified Saviour,</HI> and is publickly declared to be <HI>admitted into the Number of Chri&s;t's Flock,</HI> than to u&s;e this Sign, to intimate to us, that we &s;hould be &s;o far from <HI>being a&s;hamed</HI> of, that with St. <HI>Paul, Gal.</HI> 6 14, <HI>We &s;hould glory in the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t.</HI> And this was a Practice that always obtained in the Church from the earlie&s;t Ages, and even &s;everal Hundred Years before the Day of Popery, as is plain from the Te&s;timonies of St <HI>Cyprian</HI> and <HI>Ter|tullian,</HI> within little more than a Hundred Years of the Apo&s;tles, which renders it highly probable that it was the very thing alluded to in <HI>Rev.</HI> 7 3. where we read of <HI>Sealing the Servants of God in their Forheads,</HI> &s;o far is it from being <HI>a Mark of the Bea&s;t,</HI> as &s;ome opprobriou&s;ly, and I may &s;ay, profanely call it! And la&s;tly, what can be more properly and wi&s;ely done, than to &s;et apart par|ticular Days and Sea&s;ons to commemorate the &s;everal Steps which our glorious Redeemer took in accompli&s;hing our Redemption, and his Apo|&s;tles in propagating the Knowledge of it: For by this Means every Mini&s;ter is obliged once a Year to explain, and the People have Opportuni|ty as often to hear opened, each Article of the Chri&s;tian Faith, and &s;o a lively Sen&s;e of every one of them is the better kept up in their Minds; whereas you may go to Meeting &s;everal Years (and perhaps all your Days) and never hear &s;eve|ral Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith, &s;uch as the
<PB N="13" REF="003672_0012_100241440BBF7A10">
<HI>Trinity,</HI> the <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;en&s;ion of Chri&s;t,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> once particularly ex|plained or in&s;i&s;ted upon, and the Sen&s;e of them is in Danger of being lo&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But you will &s;ay, <HI>Where has God com|manded the&s;e Things, and does he not give this Rea&s;on for the Unlawfulne&s;s of &s;uch Things, that</HI> he commanded them not? <HI>Jer.</HI> 7 31. I an&s;wer no: For that Text don't &s;peak of Things in their own Nature indifferent, but what is notoriou&s;ly &s;inful and idolatrous, <HI>building high places and wor&s;hipping Idols,</HI> which when he &s;ays <HI>he had not commanded,</HI> the meaning is he had forbidden them. And it betrays great (not to &s;ay wilful) Ignorance of the Figures u&s;ed often in Scripture-Language, to put &s;uch an Interpretation on this Text. So that the proper Que&s;tion in the&s;e and the like Ca&s;es, is not <HI>Where has God commanded them?</HI> But <HI>Where has he forbidden them?</HI> For it is certain, that we may lawfully do any thing that God has not forbidden; and I dare challenge you to &s;hew one Text, that forbids the&s;e or any Thing el&s;e that the Church requires. But then let me a&s;k in my turn, where has God command|ed your Relations as Terms of Communion, or your Form of Church Covenant, or that you &s;hould keep a Fa&s;t on the 15th of <HI>April</HI> (&s;uppo&s;e) or a Thanksgiving on the 9th of <HI>November?</HI> You have no Rule in Scripture for keeping the&s;e Days. O, you will &s;ay, <HI>Our Governours command the&s;e Day to be ob&s;erved, and we are commanded to o|bey

them!</HI> Very good; the &s;ame &s;ay we: Do you ju&s;tify your &s;elves in the&s;e Matters, and with the &s;ame Breath you ju&s;tify us in every Thing we plead for: God has no where forbidden us the&s;e Practices, and our Governours both in Church and State have commanded them, and God has com|manded us <HI>to &s;ubmit to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords &s;ake,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2 13. and <HI>to obey them that have the Rule over us, who watch for our Souls, Heb.</HI> 13 17. and therefore we mu&s;t ob&s;erve the&s;e Rites and Days in Obedience to him as well as them.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But you will &s;ay, <HI>Is not this teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men? Mat.</HI> 15 9. I an&s;wer, no: For what the Phari&s;ees were there condemned for, was 1. advancing human Inventions into e&s;&s;ential Doctrines, as tho' they were Divine and nece&s;&s;ary in them&s;elves; where|as we declare the&s;e Things &s;till indifferent in their own Nature. You &s;eem rather guilty of this, in in&s;i&s;ting on your Church Covenant, and (in &s;ome Places) Relations, as Terms of Communion, un|der the Notion of their being Divine Ordinances, and in making the ab&s;olute Prede&s;tination of par|ticular Per&s;ons, an e&s;&s;ential Doctrine, which real|ly is no where taught in Scripture. 2. The Pha|ri&s;ees are here accu&s;ed of ju&s;tling out and &s;etting a&s;ide Divine Commands, by, and for the &s;ake of human Ordinances: Thus <HI>v.</HI> 6.

<P><HI>Object.</HI> But you &s;ay, <HI>why will you offend your weak Brethren by the&s;e Things? St. Paul &s;ays,</HI> 1 Cor. 8 13. Rom. 14. <HI>he would rather not eat Fle&s;h while he lived than offend.</HI> I an&s;wer, I am glad you are &s;en&s;ible that you are but weak Brethren, as indeed you really are if you take Offence at &s;uch innocent harmle&s;s Things. But pray wherein do we offend you? To offend in the Apo&s;tles Sen&s;e, is to lay a Stumbling-Block before our Brother, &s;o as to cau&s;e him to &s;in. Now I can't &s;ee where|in the Church is guilty of tempting you into any &s;inful Practices; &s;o far from this, that I would wi&s;h you to ob&s;erve, That the Apo&s;tle in tho&s;e Places is &s;peaking of Things, not only indifferent in them&s;elves, but tho&s;e concerning which nei|ther divine nor humane Authority had interpo&s;ed to command or forbid, with Re&s;pect to which in|deed we mu&s;t <HI>become all things to all Men;</HI> but does it hence follow, that we mu&s;t di&s;obey God, or even lawful human Authority for Fear of of|fending? Nay, &s;o far from this, that we &s;hould properly, according to the Apo&s;tles Sen&s;e, offend, if we &s;hould not conform to the Laws of both Church and State; for then our Example of Di&s;|obedience to Authority would tend to confirm tho&s;e that di&s;&s;ent from us in their Di&s;obedi|ence.</P>

are <HI>Arminians,</HI> To this I an&s;wer, That we hold no Doctrines now but what were held and taught in our Church long before <HI>Arminius</HI> was heard of as I can make appear from &s;undry of the Writings of our fir&s;t Reformers and Martyrs, <HI>Cranmer, Hooper,</HI> and <HI>Ridley, &amp;c.</HI> And if <HI>Arminius</HI> hap|pened to agree with them in &s;ome of his Notions, I know no Rea&s;on however, why we &s;hould be called after his Name. In Short, we have no Bu|&s;ine&s;s with <HI>Arminius,</HI> he was a <HI>Dutch Pre&s;byterian,</HI> and we are none of his Followers: <HI>We call no Man Ma&s;ter upon Earth, for one is our Ma&s;ter in Hea|ven,</HI> we are Followers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his noble Army of Martyrs, who &s;ealed the Truth with their Blood. In a Word we hold no Doctrines but what where always held from the Begining, even in the pure&s;t times of Chri&s;tianity, none but what the Apo&s;tles every where taught, and are plainly revealed to us in the holy Scriptures, which our Church a&s;&s;erts to be her only Rule of Faith.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;ome would wickedly per&s;wade you, <HI>That we lay a&s;ide the Scriptures, and build on hu|man Authority:</HI> This as well as all the re&s;t, is a groundle&s;s Slander. 'Tis true, we make u&s;e of the ancient Writers, to help us in finding out the Sen&s;e of Scriptures, and appeal to the certain Facts of the earlie&s;t Ages of the Church, as our be&s;t Guides in doubtful Ca&s;es, where the Sen&s;e of Scripture is Di&s;puted, to determine the true Mean|ing of it; but &s;till that is our Rule both of Faith

Nay, your Teachers have in &s;ome Ca&s;es u&s;ed the &s;ame Arguments again&s;t them as we do, as &s;ome of you very well know, and if you think them wrong in &s;ome Things, why mayn't I think &s;o in others, and at the &s;ame Time have as much Cha|rity for them as you have.</P>

And as to your <HI>Elders,</HI> You know that what Ordination they, many of them, Originally had, were perform'd by the Brethren mere Laymen, who were allowed to Ordain in the pure Days of Your fore-Fathers, as appears by the <HI>Platform</HI> agreed upon at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in the Year 1649. <HI>Chap.</HI> 9. The like certainly was ne|ver heard of before in the whole Chri&s;tian Church. But &s;uppo&s;e Your Mini&s;ters were Originally Or|dain'd by Bi&s;hops; Yet the Bi&s;hops that Ordain|ed them never gave them Power to Ordain others: So that any one Captain or Ju&s;tice of the Peace, however lawfully commi&s;&s;ioned, might as well take upon them to give Commi&s;&s;ions to others and &s;et up other Captains or Ju&s;tices of the Peace as tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, even upon this Suppo&s;ition, could &s;et up and commi&s;&s;ionate others. But Your Error is aggravated in this, That You &s;et up in Oppo&s;ition to Bi&s;hops, in Oppo&s;ition to that Go|vernment which was at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Church, and is thro' Gods Goodne&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hed in our own Nation and Mother Country, and this from a wrong Notion of a particular Church, as is plain from the holy Scriptures, which do not call a particular Congregation of Chri&s;tians a <HI>par|ticular Church:</HI> For the Scripture Notion of a

particular Church comprehended all the Chri&s;ti|ans in a City and Country adjacent, however &s;o many Chri&s;tians or Congregations of Chri&s;tians were contained in it. Thus we read of the <HI>Church of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the <HI>Church of Ephe&s;us,</HI> the <HI>Church of Corinth, &amp;c.</HI> That the Ca&s;e was thus with the re&s;t, we may learn from what we read of the <HI>Church of Ephe&s;us, Acts</HI> 20, 17. in which one Church you there &s;ee, there were a <HI>Numbers of Elders,</HI> and con&s;equently doubtle&s;s many Congre|gations; for the Apo&s;tle dad laboured there three Years and an half&punc; and if we may judge of his Succe&s;s by other Places, <HI>Acts</HI> 2, 41. &mdash; 4, 4. &mdash; where 3000 were converted by one Sermon, 5000 by another, <HI>&s;o mightily grew the Word and pre|vailed, Acts</HI> 19, 20. there mu&s;t have been many Congregations, as there were many Elders, in this one Church, and over the&s;e the Apo&s;tles af|terward appointed <HI>Timothy,</HI> to exerci&s;e Govern|ment and Juri&s;diction, as appears by his Epi&s;tles to him, and the like of <HI>Titus</HI> in <HI>Crete,</HI> 1 <HI>Tit.</HI> 5.

&s;peak in this matter, and we are well a&s;&s;ured we don't mi&s;under&s;tand them, becau&s;e we find plain|ly from the Hi&s;tory of the Church that this Or|der of Church Government was e&s;tabli&s;hed in all the Churches, and continued down from the Days of the Apo&s;tles thro' all the Ages of the Church, to which our Bi&s;hops have &s;ucceeded, and no other was ever tho't of for 1500 Years; &s;o that your Way is but a late invention, that was never heard of till within tho&s;e 200 Years; for I challenge all your In&s;tructors to &s;how one Church in the fir&s;t and pure&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianiy that was ever goverred after the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> or <HI>Congregational</HI> manner: So that in ca&s;ting off this Order of Bi|&s;hops, you &s;eem to me to have rejected an Ordi|nance of God, and might as well have ca&s;t off any other of his In&s;tructions that you do retain. Nay I am ready to make it appear, that there is at lea&s;t as much (if not more) Evidence for Bi&s;hops as for Infant Bapti&s;m, or the fir&s;t Day Sabbath, and that the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> are rather more excu&s;able &s;ome of them in rejecting the fir&s;t Day Sabbath, and all in denying Bapti&s;m to Infants, than you in denying Submi&s;&s;ion to Bi&s;hops. But I will be more brief in giving an Account of the other Rea|&s;ons I have again&s;t you. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd Thing I have again&s;t you is, (what I have already had Occa&s;ion to mention) that you do not follow the Apo&s;tles Rule, to <HI>&s;ub|mit to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords &s;ake.</HI> And <HI>obey them that have the Rule over you.</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI>

2, 13. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13, 17. This you are bound to do, becau&s;e God expre&s;sly commands it, and that <HI>not only for Wrath but al&s;o for Con&s;cience &s;ake, Rom.</HI> 13, 5. So that you cannot di&s;charge a good Con|&s;cience to God, unle&s;s you be obedient to tho&s;e he has &s;et over you.

<P N="3">3. For this Rea&s;on I cannot &s;ee how your Se|paration from us can be ju&s;tified or excu&s;ed, and it is clear to me, that you have broken the Peace of the Body of Chri&s;t, by needle&s;s Divi&s;ions, and the Apo&s;tle requires us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16, 17. to <HI>mark &s;uch as cau&s;e Divi&s;ions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine we have learned, and avoid them.</HI> Indeed if we had impo&s;ed on you any Doctrine or Practice <HI>contrary to the Word of God,</HI> I own we &s;hould then be the Schi&s;matics: But in as much as we require nothing of you that God has forbid|den, I don't &s;ee how you can clear your &s;elves from being guilty of Schi&s;me.</P>
<P N="4">4. I think you are to be ju&s;tly faulted that you do not read the Word of God in your public Wor|&s;hip: This was the Practice of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who <HI>&s;tood up to read in the Synagogue, Luke</HI> 4, 6. and the Apo&s;tles appeal to and approve of this Practice, <HI>Acts</HI> 13, 27. that <HI>the Writings of the Prophets were read every Sabbath Day:</HI> And
<PB N="23" REF="003672_0022_1002415B42050760">
<HI>Timothy</HI> was required 1 <HI>Eph.</HI> 4, 13. <HI>to give Atten|dance to Reading</HI> as well as <HI>Exhortation and Doc|trine.</HI> So that I cannot conceive how you came to be &s;o conceited of what you call your <HI>Gifts,</HI> as to ju&s;tle out the Reading of Gods holy Word.

<P N="5">5.

<P N="6">6. You have laid a&s;ide <HI>Publick Forms of Prayer,</HI> and in Room of them have &s;et up the <HI>extempore Way,</HI> wherein you depend on the meer Invention of your Mini&s;ter, and &s;o you cannot be agreed beforehand what to offer up to God, becau&s;e you don't know what it will be; whereas our Saviour makes it a Condition of our being heard <HI>That we &s;hould be agreed touching any Thing we would a&s;k, Mat.</HI> 18, 19. This we can't be in your A&s;&s;embly,

unle&s;s (like the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI>) we put an implicit Faith in the Mini&s;ter. Now we in the Church are free from this Difficulty; for our Service is taken, at lea&s;t two Thirds, if not three Quarters of it, Word for Word, out of the Scripture, and all con|formed to Scripture, and we all know what we are going to do, and &s;o are prepared to offer up our Addre&s;s to God unanimou&s;ly, with the <HI>Unity of the &s;pirit, in the Bond of Peace, Eph.</HI> 4, 3. and <HI>to lift up holy Hands without Wrath or Doubt|ing,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.8.

Thus <HI>David</HI> compo&s;ed ma|ny Forms of Prayer and Prai&s;e, and his P&s;alms were ever u&s;ed in public Wor&s;hip, by both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and expre&s;sly commanded by St. <HI>Paul, Eph.</HI> 5, 19. <HI>Col.</HI> 3, 16. and <HI>Solomon</HI> u&s;ed a Form in the Dedication of the Temple, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 8, 22. <HI>Hezekiah, I&s;ai.</HI> 37, 15. and 38, 9. and <HI>Daniel,</HI> 9, 4. u&s;ed Forms.

Strange it is you &s;hould be again&s;t Forms, when
<PB N="25" REF="003672_0024_1002415F4DCCCE70">
you have &s;o many Scripture Rules and Examples for it! Your only Pretence is, <HI>That you pray with the Spirit,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14, 5. which you vainly pre|tend is praying <HI>Extempore,</HI> as tho' the Spirit dictated the very Words and Phra&s;es, or at lea&s;t the Matter of your Prayers. But if this be the Meaning of it, you mu&s;t by the &s;ame Rule <HI>&s;ing Extempore</HI> al&s;o, and it will be as much &s;tinting the Spirit to &s;ing the P&s;alms, which are Forms, as to u&s;e Forms in Prayer: And indeed if your Prayers were thus in&s;pired as you pretend, I don't &s;ee why they &s;hould not be <HI>equal to canoni|cal Scripture:</HI> But I believe if you could &s;ee many of them written out Word for Word after|wards, you would be a&s;hamed to pretend they were in&s;pired.</P>
<P N="7">7. Another Thing wherein you appear to me to vary from the ancient Examples and Prece|dents in holy Scriptures, is, <HI>That the People do not bear a Part in your publick Wor&s;hip.</HI> Indeed this is what many of you are prejudiced again&s;t, becau&s;e you think it is <HI>Confu&s;ion:</HI> But let me a&s;&s;ure you, that this is meerly becau&s;e you are not accu&s;tomed to &s;uch a Method, which if you were, Experience would &s;oon convince you, as it does us, that it would be &s;o far from being Con|fu&s;ion, that it would appear the mo&s;t awakening, enlivening and every way the mo&s;t edifying Way: But I &s;hould hope that it would take off this Pre|judice, if you would con&s;ider that it was the ancient Scripture-Method of Wor&s;hip.

They could not, &s;ure, in this, be governed by the Spirit of the Go&s;pel, which is all Truth, Charity, Meekne&s;s and Moderation: This is the Spirit of Chri&s;t, with which &s;uch a cen&s;orious, malevolent and uncharitable Spirit is certainly incon&s;i&s;tent, which therefore I hope you will lay a&s;ide, con&s;idering, that <HI>they which have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, are none of his, Rom.</HI> 8, 9.</P>
<P>TO conclude therefore, let me be&s;eech you in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s, to give the&s;e Things an unbya&s;&s;ed, candid and &s;erious Con&s;ideration; and let nothing but a pure di&s;intere&s;ted Love of Truth and Right influence you in examining the Weight and Imporance of them: For if you receive not <HI>the Love of the Truth,</HI> and do not en|quire after it, and embrace it, purely for its own &s;ake, but are governed only by Vogue, Cu&s;tom, Fa&s;hion and worldly Con&s;iderations, and for the &s;ake of them <HI>hold fa&s;t deceit, and refu&s;e to let it go,</HI> or (which in Effect is the &s;ame Thing) if you lazily or negligently &s;it down, in a carele&s;s in|con&s;ideratene&s;s about it, you may provoke <HI>God to &s;end you &s;trong Delu&s;ions,</HI> and leave you under

the Power of them, to run on into enle&s;s Mazes of Contention and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>BE not therefore afraid or any Account un|willing to acquaint your &s;elves with the Church, and examine the Matter fairly on both Sides. This can do you no harm, and may do you a great Deal of Good: For if upon a fair and impartial Examination on both &s;ides you find, that, accor|ding to the be&s;t of your Judgment, the Truth is on the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting</HI> Side, you will then be rea&s;ona|ble, and at lea&s;t you would learn to be <HI>Charitable Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and con&s;equently be the more accept|able in continuing as you are: But if you &s;hould find (as I doubt not but you will; for the Church is not afraid, nay is glad, to &s;tand the Te&s;t of a &s;erious, hone&s;t and impartial Examination; I &s;ay, if you &s;hould find) That the Truth is on the Side of the Church, you will not repent of your In|quiry: For I conclude, certainly, if you are Per&s;ons of Hone&s;ty and Seriou&s;ne&s;s, you would rather be on the &s;ide of the Church, then not be on the Side of Truth: For to be deceived or in an Error, in any Ca&s;e, is to be in a wretched and unnatural Condition. And if you would thus uprightly enquire, and be thus impartially de|termined, you would then Act the Part of rea&s;on|able Creatures, and perform an <HI>acceptable</HI> be|cau&s;e <HI>a rea&s;onable Service,</HI> and be able <HI>to ren|der to every one a Rea&s;on of the Hope that is in you,</HI> and which is yet of infinitely greater Im|portance, you would then be able at la&s;t to give

the better Account of your &s;elves to God. And certainly, if, having an Opporunity to enquire and inform your &s;elves, to examine and judge for your &s;elves, you neglect it' and will not put your &s;elves into the Way of being impartial|ly in&s;tructed, but &s;hut your Eyes again&s;t the Light, you can't but have much to an&s;wer for, and which I don't &s;ee how you can give an Ac|count of; wherereas, if you would thus hone&s;tly and &s;eriou&s;ly inquire after the Truth, with a &s;tu|dious and con&s;cientious Endeavour to find it, that you may be practically govern'd by it, you would not fail, by God's Ble&s;&s;ing, to find it, and be led by it in the Way of <HI>Peace and Holine&s;s, through Faith, unto Salvation,</HI> which is the earne&s;t Pray|er, and &s;hall be the hearty endeavour of</P>
