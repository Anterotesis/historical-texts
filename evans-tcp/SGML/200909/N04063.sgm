<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AMONG the great and precious <HI>Pro|mi&s;es</HI> contain'd in the Holy Scriptures, we find that good Word, I&s;a. <HI>44.3. &mdash;I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Ble&s;&s;ing upon thine Off|&s;pring.</HI> Accordingly, Our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> ma|nife&s;ted his Di&s;plea&s;ure when his Di&s;ciples rebuked &s;uch as brought young Children to him; &s;aying, <HI>Suffer little Children to come unto me, and for|bid them not; for of &s;uch is the Kingdom of God. And he took them into his Arms, put his Hands upon them, and ble&s;&s;ed them,</HI> Mark <HI>10.13.&mdash;16.</HI> Now this Action of our Saviour de|mon&s;trates that &s;ome Children are ble&s;&s;ed, and that with &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly Things, being the Heirs of the Kingdom of God. And no doubt the <HI>Infant-Seed</HI> of <HI>Believers</HI> make no &s;mall Part of the Kingdom of Glory. Yea, there have been &s;ome <HI>little Ones</HI> in whom have been found remarkable Signs of an extraordinary Conver&s;ion: Such Ma|nife&s;tations
<PB N="ii" REF="005008_0003_100E28116D6CF3B8">
of a &s;aving Knowledge of God, and of Chri&s;t, as gave abundant Rea&s;on to hope they were taught of God; the Power of God's Grace being magnified in the natural Infirmities of their Child|hood.</P>
<P>The <HI>Child,</HI> who is the Subject of the en&s;uing <HI>Narrative,</HI> (drawn up by another Hand, and well atte&s;ted;) is ju&s;tly reckon'd One of this happy Number. Her Behaviour in her Sickne&s;s was a|bove her Years. And her dying Speeches &s;eem'd plainly to &s;hew that the Favour of God in Chri&s;t, was in her E&s;teem better than Life. May God &s;upport her pious <HI>Mother</HI> under her great Langui&s;h|ments and Pains, with the joyful Hope of going to this de&s;ireable Child; but more e&s;pecially of being <HI>pre&s;ent with the Lord,</HI> when &s;he &s;hall be <HI>ab&s;ent from the Body.</HI></P>
<P>And now, Let us <HI>prai&s;e</HI> our glorious Lord, who gives &s;uch Grace unto Children, and ordains Strength out of their Mouths.</P>
<P>Let <HI>godly Parents</HI> be excited and encouraged to come to the Throne of Grace, to a&s;k Grace for their Children. Ble&s;&s;ed be God! The Infant-Seed of Believers, are not Aliens from the Common-Wealth of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> nor Strangers to the Covenant of Promi&s;e. <HI>No, The Promi&s;e is to you, and to your Chil|dren.</HI> God's Promi&s;e to <HI>Abraham,</HI> before the giv|ing of the Law, was, That <HI>He would be a God to him, and to his Seed after him,</HI> Gen. <HI>17.7.</HI> And the Word of God a&s;&s;ureth us, that the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham is come upon the believing Gentiles,</HI> Gal. <HI>3.13, 14, 16.</HI> What an Encouragement is here given to our Faith, in praying for our Chil|dren! What an Obligation is here laid upon us, to
<PB N="iii" REF="005008_0004_100E5C8863CCB028">
give up our Children unto God in <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> and then to bring them up in the <HI>Nurture and Admo|nition of the Lord!</HI> The more diligent and faithful we are in an&s;wering our Covenant Engagements, the more Comfort &s;hall we probably enjoy in our Children while they live, and the more Hope &s;hall we have in their Death, if it plea&s;eth God to take them from us in their Childhood.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Children</HI> al&s;o be affected and mov'd to in|quire after the God of their Fathers, and to &s;eek him early. Cry to him, <HI>My Father, Thou art the Guide of my Youth.</HI> Offer up your fir&s;t ripe Fruits unto God. Begin in the Morning of your Days to &s;erve him who is the Lord of all your Time. You are &s;trongly oblig'd to this, not only as God is your Creator, but al&s;o as you are his Chil|dren by a Covenant Relation. When you were baptized, God's Name was called upon you, and you were devoted to his Service. Do not then alienate your&s;elves from him; but glorify him with your Souls and Bodies which are his. Prize this great Privilege of being born under the Shadow of the Co|venant; but take heed le&s;t you be carnally confi|dent and &s;ecure. Know it, if your Lives are a|mong the Unclean, you &s;hall be ca&s;t into outer Dark|ne&s;s, tho' you are the Children of the (vi&s;ible) Kingdom. Be earne&s;t with God therefore to give you that invi&s;ible Grace which is repre&s;ented by Wa|ter in <HI>Bapti&s;m.</HI> This divine Ordinance teacheth you, That by Nature you are defiled, being <HI>&s;hapen in Iniquity and conceiv'd in Sin.</HI> Seek to God then to wa&s;h you thoroughly from your Iniquity, and to clean&s;e you from your Sin, by pouring out his holy Spirit upon you, and &s;o applying the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="005008_0005_100E5C670A68F290">
to your Souls. In a Word, labour to know the ho|ly Scriptures from your Childhood, learn your Ca|techi&s;m, pray to God, keep the Sabbath holy, be du|tiful to your Parents, fly the Sins of Pride, Idlene&s;s, Uncleanne&s;s, Lying, Calling wicked Names, and all other youthful Lu&s;ts; and follow the Things that are pure and lovely and of good Report.</P>
<P>Now, That you may be animated and encouraged to make ha&s;te to keep God's Commandments, by the exemplary In&s;tance of early Piety &s;et before you in the following Pages, I do in an e&s;pecial Manner commend this <HI>little Book</HI> to your attentive Reading, and you to the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of that God who teacheth us to profit, be&s;eeching him to fulfill that gracious Promi&s;e in you, I&s;a. <HI>54.13. And all thy Chil|dren &s;hall be taught of the Lord, and great &s;hall be the Peace of thy Children.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. _ELIZABETH BUTCHER, Daugh|ter to <HI>Alvin</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth Butcher</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> was born <HI>Ju|ly</HI> 14th 1709. Her Parents gave her up to God from the Womb, and as &s;oon as &s;he was capable of &s;peaking, they began to in&s;truct her in the Things of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. When &s;he was about two Years and an Half old, as &s;he lay in the Cradle, &s;he would ask her|&s;elf that Que&s;tion, 'What is my corrupt Na|ture?' and would make An&s;wer again to her|&s;elf,
<PB N="2" REF="005008_0007_100E5C68C82D9120">
'It is empty of Grace, bent unto Sin, and only to Sin, and that continually. 'She took great Delight in learning her Catechi&s;m, and would not willingly go io Bed without &s;aying &s;ome Part of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. She being a weakly Child, her Mother carried her into the Country for her Health: And when &s;he was about three Years old, and at Mee|ting &s;he would &s;et with her Eyes fix'd on the Mini&s;ter, to the Admiration of all that &s;at about her, who &s;aid that grown up People might learn and take Example of her. She took great De|light in Reading, and was ready and willing to receive In&s;truction.</P>
<P N="4">4. But nothing more extraordinary as we re|member appeared in her, till &s;he came to be a|bout &s;ix Years old. Then &s;he began to inquire concerning God, and the Nature and Affairs of her Soul, and &s;he &s;aid, &s;he was afraid &s;he had not lived up to that End for which &s;he was made. She was asked, What was the End &s;he was made for? The Child an&s;wered, &mdash; To glorify God: But I am afraid I have not lived to the Glory of God, as I &s;hould have done. She was told, That &s;he mu&s;t pray to God, that he would be plea&s;ed to pardon her Sins, and give her Grace to &s;erve and glorify him.</P>
<P N="5">5. She was not contented with the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">e Reading of God's Word, but would frequently ask the Meaning of it. And when &s;he was at her Work, &s;he would often ask where &s;uch and &s;uch Places of Scripture were, and would menti|on the Words, that &s;he might be directed to find them.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="3" REF="005008_0008_100E5C8EE4BD26C0">6. It was her Practice to carry her Catechi&s;m or &s;ome other good Book to Bed with her, and in the Morning &s;he would be &s;itting up in her Bed reading before any of the Family were awake be&s;ides her.</P>
<P N="7">7. One Day as &s;he was &s;itting by the Fire, &s;he a&s;k'd,&mdash;Why our fir&s;t Parents eating the for|bidden Fruit was counted Sin to them? At ano|ther Time &s;he a&s;k'd, Who were meant by the wi&s;e and fooli&s;h Virgins? And what was meant by the Oyl in the Lamps? And as &s;he was read|ing a Sermon of Dr. COTTON MATHER'S, &s;he a&s;k'd, Who was meant by the goodly Cedar? And when &s;he was told, &s;he &s;aid,&mdash;And who are meant by the Fowls that are but ju&s;t fledged? She was told they meant, little Children: and Chri&s;t called them to come to him. But, &s;aid &s;he, How can I, who am but a Child, go to Chri&s;t? Being inform'd, &s;he &s;aid, &mdash; But will Chri&s;t accept of me? She was an&s;wered, Yes; and &s;everal Places of Scripture were mentioned for her Encouragement.</P>

<P N="1">1. _IN <HI>September,</HI> 1716, &s;he was taken ill and in her Sickne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> her &s;elf with &s;uch wonderful Patience as that all that came near admir'd. She wou'd often put up that Reque&s;t, <Q>Heavenly Father,
<PB N="4" REF="005008_0009_100E5C6C5B603D60">
Give me thy Chri&s;t, give me thy Grace, and pardon all my Sins, for Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake, A|men.</Q> Then &s;he &s;aid, What is Sanctification? And made An&s;wer to her&s;elf, <Q>It is the Work of God's free Grace.&mdash;What are the Benefits which in this Life do accompany or flow from Ju&s;tification, Adoption, and Sanctification? They are, A&s;&s;urance of God's Love, Peace of Con&s;cience, Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, Increa&s;e of Grace, and Per&s;everance therein to the End.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Being a&s;k'd, if &s;he was willing to die, and go to Chri&s;t; &s;he &s;aid Yes: But Child you know you are a Sinner; &s;he &s;aid, Yes: And you know where the Wicked go when they die; &s;he &s;aid, Yes, they are ca&s;t into Hell: And being a&s;k'd if &s;he was not afraid of going thither; &s;he &s;aid, No, For Chri&s;t is an all-&s;ufficient Saviour, and he is able to &s;ave me, and I hope he will: Tho' I have not yet &s;een Chri&s;t, yet I hope I &s;hall &s;ee him.</P>
<P N="3">3. A while after &s;he &s;aid, I am weary of this World, and long to be gone: O when &s;hall I go, O when &s;hall I go! Her Mother a&s;ked her, if &s;he was willing to leave her alone? She an&s;wer'd, Yes, For when you die, I hope you will go to Heaven too.</P>
<P N="4">4. She feeling an Alteration in her&s;elf, de|&s;ir'd her Mother to &s;end for Mr. SEWALL, and when he came, he asked her how &s;he did; &s;he an&s;wered, Very weak: He a&s;ked her if &s;he was willing to die? She &s;aid, Yes: He &s;aid, Do you know that you are a Sinner? She &s;aid, Yes: He a&s;k'd her, if &s;he had not heard that there was a|nother and a better World than this? She an|&s;wer'd,
<PB N="5" REF="005008_0010_100E5C915AD53F58">
Yes. He a&s;k'd her &s;everal other Que&s;|tions, but they &s;lipt my Memory. He was go|ing to a&s;k her one Que&s;tion, but &s;aid it was a great one to ask a Child, but however he would, and &s;aid to her, Child, are you willing humbly to &s;ubmit to the Will of God, either for Life or Death? She &s;aid, Yes.</P>
<P N="5">5. A while after &s;he was weeping, and being a&s;ked the Rea&s;on, &s;he &s;aid, <Q>I tho't I &s;aw the Flames of Hell, and was going there, but I tho't I &s;aw Chri&s;t, and he called me to come to him, and then I was not afraid; and I have cried to God for Grace to &s;erve him.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6. A while after &s;he was taken with Convul|&s;ion Fits, and lay &s;everal Hours, all Hopes of Re|covery being taken away: But &s;he reviving a|gain, her Pain returned with greater Violence: She prayed to God to take her away out of this mi&s;erable World, and cried, &mdash;<Q>O God, my God, If thou wilt plea&s;e to take me away, I will be willing to bear what Pain thou &s;halt plea&s;e to lay upon me: O God, my dear God, I love thee dearly!</Q> And this &s;he repeated &s;everal Times over.</P>
<P N="7">7. Her Mother &s;itting by her weeping, the Child &s;aid, Dear Mother, you make me have more Pain: Her Mother &s;aid, No, my dear Child, I don't: She &s;aid, Yes, you cry, and that troubles me, and cau&s;es me to have more Pain.</P>
<P N="8">8. Mr. SEWALL being &s;ent for again, he &s;aid, Child, Is it not better to be in Heaven with God and Chri&s;t, than to be here? She an&s;wered, Yes, Yes. He a&s;k'd her if he &s;hould pray to God that he would be pleas'd to take her to him&s;elf?
<PB N="6" REF="005008_0011_100E5C6E90EB2570">
She made a quick Reply, doubling her Words, Yes, Yes. He asked her another Que&s;tion, but being in great Trouble, it &s;lipt my Memory: But the Child made no An&s;wer to it, and only &s;aid, I am &s;pent.</P>
<P N="9">9. A few Hours after, her Pains abating a|gain, the Fits returned with more Violence than before, and held her for &s;everal Hours, and then left her. She lay for &s;ome Days &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s that &s;he knew not tho&s;e that came to &s;ee her. But it plea&s;ed God to re&s;tore her again to her for|mer Health: And before &s;he was able to &s;it up, &s;he wou'd call for her Book, and lay and read by the Hour together.</P>

<P N="1">1. _SHE had by Cour&s;e read almo&s;t thro' the Old Te&s;tament; but at other Times her Delight was to read in the New, concerning the Birth of Chri&s;t, and his Sufferings; and would a&s;k the Meaning of what &s;he read.</P>
<P N="2">2. One Day as &s;he &s;at by her&s;elf reading the 7th of the Revelations, concerning the Number of them that were &s;ealed; when &s;he came to the 9th Ver&s;e, &s;he was overheard to weep 'till &s;he came to the End of the Chapter.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="005008_0012_100E280D286D5D80">3. One Morning as &s;he lay in her Bed, &s;he a&s;ked, What was meant by the Fountain, and the Hou&s;e of David, and the Inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, in Zech. 13.1.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hearing a Sermon from <HI>Luke</HI> 15. concern|ing the Prodigal Son; a few Days after, &s;he was &s;aying the Text over to her&s;elf; &s;he then a&s;k'd, Who was meant by the Father; and who by the Son?</P>
<P N="5">5. She had begun to learn the Proofs of the A&s;&s;emblies Catechi&s;m; and when &s;he came to that in, 1 Joh. 5.7. She a&s;ked, If the Father was God, and if the Son was God al&s;o, and if the Holy Gho&s;t was God al&s;o? For it is &s;aid here, That there are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Gho&s;t, and the&s;e Three are One: And this &s;eems as if there were Three Gods, and yet three is but One. And &s;he de&s;ired to be told &s;omething of this My&s;tery. She was told, There was but one GOD, tho' there were Three Per&s;ons in the Godhead. That Chri&s;t was the Eternal Son of God, and the &s;ame in Sub&s;tance and equal with the Father in Power and Glory, and was God. Then &s;aid the Child, Tho' Chri&s;t be the Son of God, yet is He God al&s;o? An&s;wer was made her, Yes: and the Holy Gho&s;t was the Spirit of God, and proceeded both from the Father and the Son, and was the &s;ame in Sub&s;tance with them both, and was equal in Power and Glory. And a while after &s;he a&s;ked. If Chri&s;t took upon him the Nature of a Man? She was told that he did.</P>
<P N="6">6. She rejoiced greatly when the Lord's Day came, e&s;pecially if it were fair Weather for her
<PB N="8" REF="005008_0013_100E5C7279E54230">
to go to the Publick Wor&s;hip of God. And when &s;he came Home, &s;he would take a Book, and &s;it and read, till it was time to go to the Afternoon Exerci&s;e, without the lea&s;t &s;ign of Wearine&s;s. And if &s;he was detained at Home on the Sabbath; &s;he would not &s;pend the Day in Idlene&s;s, but in religious Imployments.</P>
<P N="7">7. It plea&s;ed God to exerci&s;e her with great Pain in every Part of her Body, which did &s;ome|thing impair the Natural Quickne&s;s and Strength of her Sen&s;es. But between two or three Months before her Death, her Under&s;tanding was bright|ned to admiration.</P>
<P N="8">8. When the Spring came on, and mention was made of the Publick Catechizing; &s;he Rejoi|ced greatly, and would be often &s;peaking of its drawing near. One Morning as &s;he lay in her Bed &s;he &s;aid; O that charming Duty, O that &s;weet Day is coming: Being a&s;k'd, what Day &s;he meant? She an&s;wered, Catechizing Day, I mean that &s;weet Day. A few Days after &s;he &s;aid, I won't depend upon going to Catechizing, for I believe I &s;hall be prevented by &s;ome means or other. She was told, If &s;he was well and the Weather per|mitted, nothing el&s;e wou'd hinder her. Ah! &s;aid the Child, I am per&s;waded, I &s;hall be prevented &s;ome way or other from going. And according to the &s;trong Impul&s;e &s;he had upon her Mind, it proved to her: For &s;he was taken Sick two or three Days before the Catechizing came, which was in April 1718.</P>

<P N="1">1 _WHEN She was fir&s;t taken, &s;he was in &s;ome doubt of her &s;piritual State, and &s;aid, She was afraid &s;he did not belong to God, nor love him as &s;he &s;hould; for Mother, you have told me, that they that fear God and love him, would make it their chief Care and En|deavour to keep his Commandments; but I am afraid I have not kept them as I ought. Her Mother a&s;k'd her, what particular Command &s;he cou'd accu&s;e her &s;elf of breaking? She &s;aid, The Fifth Commandment &s;aith, Honour thy Father and thy Mother, and have I honoured you? have I obeyed you as I ought? Her Mother told her; You have been an obedient Child to me, and wherein you have offended in any &s;mall Matter, I do forgive you, and pray God to forgive you al&s;o.</P>
<P N="2">2.

She was told, tho' her Sins were never &s;o many and great, yet the Mercy of God was greater, and more abun|dant than her Sins; for that was like him&s;elf In|finite, and endureth forever, that there was For|givene&s;s with him; and that he had Promi&s;ed, that tho&s;e who confe&s;s and for&s;ake their Sins &s;hould

But &s;he was then Exhorted not to give way to the Temptations of Satan, but to hope in the Mercy of God; for the Lord taketh Plea&s;ure in them that Fear him, and in them that hope in his Mercy. And &s;he was told that he &s;ay'd in I&s;a. 55.7. <Q>Let the Wicked for&s;ake his Way and the unrighteous Man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly Pardon.</Q></P>

A while after &s;he &s;aid, behold I was &s;hap|en in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother con|ceive me: I am a mi&s;erable and &s;inful Creature; Convinced I am of Sin, but afraid not Conver|ted; I am a poor Creature that has no &s;ight of my Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t; and without a Chri&s;t, with|out a Chri&s;t, I am undone for ever; Oh for a Chri&s;t, Oh for a Chri&s;t, for a Chri&s;t to &s;ave me! And then &s;he prayed, and &s;aid &mdash;</P>
<P N="4">4. Lord, have Mercy on me according to thy loving Kindne&s;s; according to the Multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out all my Trangre&s;|&s;ions with thine own Blood: Wa&s;n me thro'ly from mine Iniquities, and clean&s;e me from my Sins: Create in me a clean Heart, O God, and re|new a right Spirit within me: O give me a new Heart, a humble Heart, a broken Heart, and contrite Spirit: Oh Sanctify me by thy Holy Spirit thro' out, in Soul, Spirit, and Body: Re|new me in the whole Man after thine own I|mage in Knowledge, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Ho|line&s;s: Oh give me a Chri&s;t, give me thy Grace,
<PB N="11" REF="005008_0016_100E5C9B0E47E628">
Pardon all my Sins: O Lord take away all mine Iniquities, and receive me graciou&s;ly, Circumci&s;e my Heart to fear thy Name, and lead me in the Way that is plea&s;ing in thy Sight: Oh be my God in Life, my Guide unto Death, and the un|changeble Portion of my Soul forever: Fit and prepare me for all Changes, but e&s;pecially for Death my great and la&s;t Change: And this I beg for thy Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake, AMEN.</P>
<P N="5">5. In the time of her Health &s;he was very careful of her Words, and no ill Language was ever heard to proceed from her Lips. Yet now in her Sickne&s;s, &s;he examin'd her &s;elf what Sins &s;he had been Guilty of, both in Words and Acti|ons. And taking a view of the Commandments, &s;ome of them &s;he &s;aid &s;he was afraid &s;he had been guilty of breaking, and did accu&s;e her &s;elf of Di&s;|obedience. and condemn'd her &s;elf for her Sins. And being in great Pain of Body; &s;he &s;aid, Now am I &s;uffering the De&s;ert of my Sins: Oh that I might have but a Moments ca&s;e: But I need not wonder that I have no ca&s;e, for I de&s;erve none: Have Mercy upon me O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord heal me, for my Bones are &s;ore vexed: Look upon my Afflictions and my Pain, and forgive all my Sins.</P>
<P N="6">6. Mr. <HI>Prince</HI> came in to &s;ee her: She de&s;i|red him to Pray with her: He a&s;k'd her what he &s;hould Pray for? She an&s;wered That God would be pleas'd to Pardon all her Sins, and give her an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. A while after &s;he cried out, O I am a poor Creature that wants A&s;&s;urance: Oh for A&s;&s;urance, Oh for A&s;&s;urance! Oh that God wou'd be pleas'd
<PB N="12" REF="005008_0017_100E5C776231A1B0">
to lift up the Light of his Countenance upon me! O that he would be pleas'd to own me in his Covenant, and Ble&s;s me. Her Mother &s;eeing her in this Di&s;tre&s;s, a&s;k'd her if &s;he &s;hould &s;end for Mr. SEWALL to talk with him, and hear what he had to &s;ay to her? The Child an&s;wered, Mr. SEWALL may give me Encouragement as you do, but except God &s;peaks to me too, all will &s;ignify nothing. Well Child, &s;aid her Mother, wait upon God &s;till, who will in his own Time, I hope, &s;peak Peace to thy Soul. Mr. SEWALL was &s;ent for, but he was not at home.</P>
<P N="8">8. She was told for her Encouragement, that &s;he was a Lamb of Chri&s;t's Flock; and that he had &s;aid, he would take the Lambs in his Arms, and carry them in his Bo&s;om; and &s;uffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of &s;uch is the Kingdom of Heaven; and you know that Promi&s;e in Prov. 8.17. I Love them that Love me, and tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me. The Child an&s;wered, If the Lord will plea&s;e to help me, I will &s;eek him. She was told that the Lord would help her, and was exhorted to tru&s;t in the Free Grace and Mercy of God thro' Chri&s;t. Oh, &s;aid the Child; I am willing to ac|cept of Chri&s;t, but I am afraid Chri&s;t is not will|ing: An&s;wer was made, that if &s;he was willing to accept of Chri&s;t, that to be &s;ure Chri&s;t was will|ing to accept of her: She an&s;wered, I am willing.</P>
<P N="9">9. A while after &s;he &s;aid, I will venture my Soul upon Chri&s;t, and if I peri&s;h, Lord, it &s;hall be at the Fountain of thy Mercy: For thou ha&s;t pro|mi&s;ed, that who&s;oever cometh unto thee, thou wilt in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out. O Lord I de&s;ire as I am able, to come unto thee, and I am &s;ure thou wilt
<PB N="13" REF="005008_0018_100E5C9CDC9FCDF8">
not ca&s;t me off. And &s;he was compos'd for &s;ome time: But Satan a&s;&s;aulted her again in &s;etting her Sins before her; and &s;he cried out, Oh the Sin of my Nature, (unle&s;s my Soul be &s;prinkled with the Blood of Chri&s;t,) is enough to undoe me, were I guilty of no other.</P>
<P N="10">10. About a Month before her Death, on the Sabbath in the Afternoon, &s;he &s;aid to her Mother; Now I have a believing &s;ight of Chri&s;t: Now Chri&s;t is mine and I am his: Oh, how &s;weet is Chri&s;t: Oh he is &s;weet, he is &s;weet! and if you did but ta&s;te and feel what I do, you would long to be gone. Then &s;he &s;aid; Come Lord Je&s;us, come quickly: Dear Je&s;us, &s;weet Je&s;us, come quickly. Then &s;he &s;aid; Lord Je&s;us give me Patience, give me Patience to wait thy Time, for thy Time is the be&s;t Time: Lord Je&s;us give me Patience.</P>
<P N="11">11. Her Mother &s;at weeping by her, and to comfort her, the Child &s;aid; Dear Mother, tho' we part now, it will be but a little while before you will follow and come to me: and that will be a happy meeting for us, to meet at the Right Hand of Chri&s;t in the great Day. Then &s;he thank'd her Mother for the In&s;tructions and Cor|rections &s;he had given her, and &s;aid had it not been for them I might have gone to Hell; but it won't be long now before the ble&s;&s;ed Angels will come and carry my Soul to the Bo&s;om of Chri&s;t; Oh I long to be gone, I long to be gone to that Ble&s;&s;ed Place: Sweet Je&s;us, come quickly.</P>
<P N="12">12. A while after &s;he &s;aid: My Pain is great which I undergo to go to Chri&s;t; but not &s;o great as the Pains Chri&s;t underwent for me: Oh I won+der
<PB N="14" REF="005008_0019_100E5C7C08813348">
I wonder that Chri&s;t &s;hould be &s;o willing to die for me who am &s;o great a Sinner.</P>
<P N="13">13. Mr. SEWALL was &s;ent for again; but be|fore he came, the Child was &s;pent with extream Pain and much &s;peaking, that &s;he was not able to &s;ay any thing to him. In the Night &s;he a&s;k'd the Young Woman that watched with her, to read the 25th of Matthew to her.</P>
<P N="14">14. One Morning &s;he a&s;k'd; where is that Place of Scripture? Eat O Friends, drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. The Gla&s;s &s;tand|ing on the Table, &s;he a&s;k'd to have it turned, and &s;aid; my Gla&s;s is almo&s;t run, my Work is almo&s;t ended.</P>
<P N="15">15. On Thur&s;day was three Weeks before her Death, her Mother &s;eeing an Alteration in her, &s;aid, my Child is &s;truck with Death. Upon which &s;he replyed, Is Death come and am I pre|pared, am I prepared? She lay &s;till for &s;ome time, and then &s;aid; O Death where is thy Sting; O Grave where is thy Victory, and what wilt thou gain by this thing!</P>
<P N="16">16. There was a Per&s;on &s;he had a peculiar Re&s;pect for, and de&s;ired her Mother when &s;he had opportunity, to &s;peak to her; for &s;he was a|fraid &s;he did not con&s;ider her Soul and Eternity.</P>
<P N="17">17. The Lord's Day following &s;he &s;aid over the 23d P&s;alm, and when &s;he had concluded it, her Mother a&s;k'd her; if &s;he was not afraid to pa&s;s thro' the dark Valley of the &s;hadow of Death? &s;he an&s;wer'd; No, for God hath promis'd that he will never leave me nor for&s;ake me, neither will he &s;uffer me to leave or for&s;ake him.</P>
<P N="18">18. She lying in great Pain Day and Night,
<PB N="15" REF="005008_0020_100E5CA09C985BB8">
wou'd often &s;ay, Lord Je&s;us give me Patience, give me Patience, that I may not di&s;honour God. She &s;aid, Oh if I &s;hou'd be deceiv'd at la&s;t, and deceive others, and they think <HI>I</HI> am Good, how mi&s;erable &s;hall <HI>I</HI> be forever?</P>
<P N="19">19. Her Aunt <HI>Stone</HI> being pre&s;ent, and the Child being in great Pain, and complaining of tho&s;e about her, for refu&s;ing to do &s;omething for her which &s;he found relieved her, but they were fear|ful of overdoing, &s;he &s;aid,&mdash;They do not pity me, but <HI>I</HI> hope Chri&s;t pities me, and will pre|pare a Place for me. A little while after, being re&s;tle&s;s with her Pains, &s;he check'd her &s;elf &s;aying, &mdash;Why do <HI>I</HI> complain? Chri&s;t endured more than this for me: <HI>I</HI> wonder how he did to bear it. And a little while after hearing it Thunder; &s;he &s;aid, it Thunders, <HI>I</HI> am afraid God will kill me with it; but whether he kills me with that, or with this Pain, if <HI>I</HI> may but go to Chri&s;t, it will be well.</P>
<P N="20">20. The Tue&s;day following Mr. SEWALL came to &s;ee her, and after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e, he a&s;k'd he on what &s;he depended for Salvation? She re|plyed, on Chri&s;t and the Promi&s;es. He &s;aid, well Child hold fa&s;t thy Faith, and &s;till tru&s;t in Chri&s;t. Then &s;he &s;aid; Oh <HI>I</HI> long to be gone to that ble&s;|&s;ed Place. He a&s;ked what ble&s;&s;ed Place? She not readily an&s;wering, he &s;aid; do you mean Heaven? She &s;aid, Yes: And when he was going away, de|&s;ir'd him to remember her in his Prayers: And a&s;k'd him when he would plea&s;e to come again to &s;ee her?</P>
<P N="21">21. Two Per&s;ons being in the Room, they &s;aid to one another; this Child has been a Child
<PB N="16" REF="005008_0021_100E5C7FE73B8888">
affliction all its Days. The Child replyed; and it is for my Good.</P>
<P N="22">22. She had another Combate with Satan and &s;aid, He wou'd per&s;uade her that Chri&s;t was with|drawn from her: And &s;he cried out, Oh what &s;hall <HI>I</HI> do, Oh what &s;hall <HI>I</HI> do? <HI>I</HI> am undone! She &s;aid, O Lord, ca&s;t me not out of thy &s;ight; ca&s;t me not away from thy pre&s;ence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me: Re&s;tore unto me the Joy of thy Salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit; never leave me nor for&s;ake me: But guide me by thy Coun&s;el while here, and after|wards receive me to thine heavenly Kingdom: And this <HI>I</HI> a&s;k for thy Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake; and in Te&s;timony of my de&s;ire and A&s;&s;urance to be heard, <HI>I</HI> &s;ay, AMEN.</P>
<P N="23">23. She was comforted again in the Night: And the Watcher &s;itting by her Bed &s;ide, about Midnight, heard her &s;ay,
<Q><L>Yonder, Yonder, up above,</L>
<L>Sits my Saviour, cloath'd in Love,</L>
<L>And there's my &s;miling God.</L></Q></P>
<P N="24">24. She &s;aid, &s;he had &s;omething to &s;ay to Mr. SEWALL the next time he came to &s;ee her: And being a&s;k'd, what it was, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would thank him for the many Prayers he put up for her, for God had heard and an&s;wered them.</P>
<P N="25">25. At another time &s;he &s;aid concerning Chri&s;t; Why is his Chariot &s;o long a coming? Why &s;tay &s;o long the Wheels of his Chariot? For me to &s;tay is Pain; but to Die is Gain.</P>
<P N="26">26. Mr. PRINCE coming to &s;ee her the Mon|day before her Death, &s;he de&s;ired him to Pray with her, he &s;aid well, and what &s;hall we Pray
<PB N="17" REF="005008_0022_100E5CA540631F00">
for now? She replyed, that I may have a &s;aving Knowledge of Chri&s;t, that God wou'd plea&s;e to Pardon all my Sins, and prepare me for Death my great &amp; la&s;t Change.</P>
<P N="27">27. The Day following, her Pains abated, and &s;he &s;eemed to be better for 2 or 3 Days, and no one perceived her to draw near her Change, till a few Minutes before &s;he was taken Speechle&s;s, the Child &s;aid, &s;omething choaked her: Her Mother felt of her Hands, and finding them in a cold Sweat, and her Countenance alter, &s;he &s;aid my Child is a going: Ah Mother, &s;aid the Child, &s;o mu&s;t you as well as I. She &s;aid &s;omething more; but her Speech and Spirits failing, we could not under&s;tand her.</P>
<P>She breath'd her Soul into the Arms of Chri&s;t on Friday, the 13th of June, 1718. Being 8 Years and ju&s;t 11 Months old.</P>
