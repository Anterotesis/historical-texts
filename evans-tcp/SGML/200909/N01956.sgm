<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>GEN. 28, 20, 21.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And Jacob vowed a Vow, &s;aying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this Way that I go, and will give me Bread to eat, and Raiment to put on; &s;o that I come again to my Fathers Hou&s;e in Peace; then &s;hall the Lord be my God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_VERY famous in Scripture Story is the devout Life and Pilgrimage of our Father <HI>Jacob.</HI> In this Chap|ter we find him beginning the <HI>world,</HI> and leaving his <HI>fathers Hou&s;e. I&s;aac</HI> called him, and ble&s;|&s;ed him, and charged him, and &s;ent him away to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> to the Hou&s;e of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> his Mother's Father. He went not without a <HI>Call,</HI> nor yet without <HI>leave,</HI> but indeed in obedience to the direction of his Parents. Yet was he de&s;olate and <HI>alone,</HI> &s;ave that he carryed away his Father's Ble&s;&s;ing with him, and <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Angels</HI> accompanied him, guarded and vi&s;ited him on his Way. At <HI>night</HI> he had out a cold and hard
<PB N="2" REF="002325_0003_0FDB24F615648830">lodging, the ground for his bed, a <HI>&s;tone</HI> for his pil|low, and the Sky for his covering; but in his <HI>dream</HI> he had the vi&s;ions of God, and &s;weet Communion with heaven.</P>
<P>HE &s;aw <HI>a ladder which reacht from earth to heaven, and behold the Angels of God a&s;cending and de&s;cending on it, and the LORD &s;tood above it.</HI> Hereby was repre|&s;ented to him the care of <HI>Providence</HI> for the Church of the Elect on earth collectively, and for every per&s;on of them &s;ingly by them&s;elves; and the communion they have with heaven while here below, by the mini&s;try of Angels, thro' the Mediation of JESUS CHRIST: For HE is the ladder, by whom there is this intercour&s;e be|tween heaven and earth, <HI>having reconciled all things in him&s;elf, whether they be things in heaven, or things on earth.</HI> By him heaven is opened to us, and the Angels of God are de&s;cending to and a&s;cending from the &s;ons of Men.</P>
<P>GOD then &s;aid to him. <HI>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of I&s;aac: the land whereon thou lye&s;t, I give thee and to thy &s;eed.</HI> GOD promi&s;ed him a <HI>numerous &s;eed,</HI> and that in it (<HI>&s;cil.</HI> CHRIST) <HI>all the Families of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Moreover, GOD &s;aid to him, <HI>Behold I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goe&s;t, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have &s;poken to thee of.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Jacob</HI> awoke out of his &s;leep he was &s;truck with a great <HI>awe</HI> and holy reverence, as well he might, and indeed ought to be. He was <HI>afraid,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>How dreadful is this place!</HI> He &s;et up the <HI>stones</HI> whereon he had &s;lept for a <HI>Pillar</HI> and Monument of that memorable event: He called the Place <HI>Bethel,</HI> i. e. <HI>the hou&s;e of God;</HI> and then made his &s;olemn <HI>Vow</HI> in the Words of my <HI>Text; And Jacob vowed a Vow, &s;aying, If God will be with me, and will keep me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<ITEM>1. The <HI>Matter</HI> of the Vow, or the thing vowed; <HI>the Lord &s;hall be my God.</HI></ITEM>

1. THE <HI>Matter</HI> of his Vow, or the thing vow'd, which is plain, &s;hort, and full; <HI>The Lord &s;hall be my God. Jehovah,</HI> the true God, his Father's God, &s;hould be his God. He <HI>owns</HI> Gods propriety in him, domini|on over him, right and title to him. He <HI>chu&s;es</HI> God for his God, and makes a free &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, a voluntary &s;urrender of him&s;elf to him, and devotes him&s;elf to his &s;ervice and glory, to wor&s;hip and obey him, <HI>as God and his God.</HI> He <HI>covenants</HI> for him&s;elf; for he had been circumci&s;ed in his Infancy, and given up to God in Co|venant; &s;et apart for him, by his mark put upon him.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Manner</HI> of this Vow, is &s;omething in form of a <HI>Condition, If God will be with me, and keep,</HI> &amp;c. But here we mu&s;t ob&s;erve,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT to be &s;ure <HI>he meant not to pre&s;cribe</HI> any terms or conditions to the Great God, which unle&s;s he fulfilled, he &s;hould not be his God. Far be this from our Thought, as it was from his. Suppo&s;e that God &s;hould deny him bread to eat, and raiment to put on; &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould never bring him back again to his Father's hou&s;e; &s;hould God then be none of his God? God forbid. We are taught to &s;ay, and no doubt <HI>Jacob</HI> had learnt as much, Job. 13.15. <HI>Tho' he &s;lay me, yet will I tru&s;t in him.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>JACOB</HI> certainly meant by this manner of &s;peech, <HI>If the Lord will be with me,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to expre&s;s his faith in the word and promi&s;e of God</HI> ju&s;t before given him, v. 15. <HI>Behold I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and bring thee again into this land.</HI> Now &s;ays <HI>Jacob, "Seeing</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>So Mr.</HI> Henry.</NOTE> God <HI>will</HI> be with me in the way wherein I go, and will keep, and feed, and return me in peace; "<HI>&s;eeing he has given me this promi&s;e and a&s;&s;urance,</HI> I do (as one bound in gratitude and ju&s;tice) make this my Vow and Engagement to the Lord, that he &s;hall be my God. He depends upon God's <HI>word</HI> to him, and makes his <HI>vows</HI> to God. Or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>JACOB</HI> meant it <HI>as a prayer</HI> to the God of his Life, his great Pre&s;erver and Benefactor, that he would be with him in his way, and thro' his Life; guide, provide for him, and ble&s;s him, as he had &s;aid; and
<PB N="4" REF="002325_0005_0FDB24F98EECE858">then he &s;ubjoyns a religious promi&s;e and holy engage|ment to God, as meet to render for &s;uch Benefits. A|greeably to what we read, Job. 22.27. <HI>Thou &s;halt make thy PRAYER unto him, and he &s;hall hear thee, and then &s;halt pay thy vows.</HI> And taking it thus as a <HI>prayer</HI> and de&s;ire to God, we may ob&s;erve the&s;e <HI>three</HI> things of it.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT his fir&s;t petition is for the <HI>pre&s;ence</HI> of God with him, and his <HI>favour</HI> to him, which is more than life.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT his reque&s;t as to worldly things is ex|ceeding <HI>mode&s;t, humble</HI> and <HI>moderate.</HI> He asks only <HI>bread to eat, and raiment to put on:</HI> He leaves it with God to choo&s;e for him convenient food: If he have but ju&s;t enough, and bare nece&s;&s;aries, it &s;hould content him, And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. OBSERVE how his natural and pious <HI>affecti|on to his father's hou&s;e and his native place</HI> wrought in him: <HI>So that I come again to my father's hou&s;e in peace.</HI> He hop'd to find his <HI>dear Parents</HI> alive at his return; he in effect begs this of God, that he might again &s;ee their faces. "<HI>E&s;au</HI> had longed (as one notes) for the <HI>days of mourning for his father:</HI> Not &s;o <HI>Jacob;</HI> no, one &s;pecial thing his heart was &s;et on is, that he might &s;ee again the venerable face of his <HI>Father,</HI> who was already blind with age.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>BUT I will not detain you any longer in de&s;cant|ing upon the copious <HI>Text:</HI> The &s;um is, If God &s;hould plea&s;e to favour him in the&s;e his petitions, he &s;hould ever hold him&s;elf mo&s;t &s;trongly engaged to <HI>cleave</HI> to him and <HI>rejoyce</HI> in him as his God.</P>
<P>UPON all, there is the abundant <HI>Grace</HI> &amp; conde&s;cen|tion of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD to be &s;een, in his allowing du&s;t and a&s;hes to &s;peak to him and covenant with him after this manner; <HI>i. e.</HI> after our own manner. As <HI>parents</HI> on earth give leave to their Children to expre&s;s their affection, reverence and duty to them after their childi&s;h manner; &s;o does our <HI>Father in heaven</HI> by his poor children here on earth.</P>
<P>BUT I come to gather up the <HI>Notes</HI> or <HI>Doctrines</HI> from the Words; which might be many, but I'll con|fine my &s;elf to three only,
<LIST>
<PB N="5" REF="002325_0006_0FDB24FA94C8C918">
<ITEM>1. THAT young people, as they grow up in their parents hou&s;es, or as they leave them and go forth in|to the world, &s;hould be able &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;olemnly to enter into Covenant with God, and make their vows to him, that the Lord &s;hall be their God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT upon making this vow upon or before your leaving your fathers hou&s;e, and going forth into the world, you mu&s;t earne&s;tly implore and humbly confide in the &s;pecial pre&s;ence, favour and grace of God to be with you, and keep you in the way that you go.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. THAT in this ca&s;e, and on this occa&s;ion a gra|cious God permits and allows you to bring into your vow, and humbly to lay before him, tho&s;e temporal favours and ble&s;&s;ings which you are in the lawful pur|&s;uit of; provided it be with a moderation of de&s;ire toward them, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God re&s;pect|ing them, and a re&s;olution thro' grace to adhere to his Coveant, Wor&s;hip and Service, in the enjoyment of them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THESE three Doctrines do I think give us the true &s;cope of my Text; and as the time allotted me will permit, I &s;hall endeavour to explain and urge them upon &s;uch of you as are growing up under our Care, or go|ing forth into the World: For which end they are now cho&s;en for me.</P>

<P>I SHALL &s;peak to this <HI>Doctrine</HI> under the follow|ing Heads.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That we are under the vow and bond of God from our <HI>Infancy.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the vow we are then brought under is this. <HI>That the Lord &s;hall be our God.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That children &s;hould be early taught this, and often &s;eriou&s;ly admoni&s;hed of it; and as our young people <HI>grow up</HI> in their fathers hou&s;es, they &s;hould &s;e|riou&s;ly
<PB N="6" REF="002325_0007_0FDB24FD9FCA7938">prepare to take this vow upon them&s;elves, and make it to the Lord with holy &s;olemnity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That when they are leaving their parents hou&s;es, and <HI>going forth into the world,</HI> may be a very proper &s;ea&s;on for &s;uch a &s;olemn tran&s;action with the Holy God.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WE are under the vow and bond of God from our Infancy.</HI> So was <HI>Jacob</HI> from his birth: At eight days old he received the token of God's Covenant in his <HI>Circumci&s;ion,</HI> which was the <HI>&s;eal of the &s;ame righteou&s;|ne&s;s of faith</HI> that <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> now is to us, in the admi|ni&s;tration of it in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Church: The &s;ame Co|venant and <HI>ble&s;&s;ing being come upon us Gentiles by faith,</HI> which God gave to <HI>Abraham;</HI> namely this, <HI>I will be a God to thee and to thy &s;eed.</HI> Our Children therefore from their Infancy are as much in the Covenant &s;tate, and the initiating &s;eal of the Covenant does as much belong to them, as the Covenant of Circumci&s;ion did to the Infants under the Law. <HI>El&s;e were your children unclean, but now they are holy,</HI> 1 Cor. 7.14. We there|fore are under the vow and bond of God from our In|fancy: And no doubt but &s;o were the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> children that were born into the world accounted and dedicated to God; which it may be <HI>Eve</HI> meant when &s;he &s;aid upon the birth of <HI>Cain, I have gotten a man from the Lord;</HI> a child <HI>for</HI> him.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Vow</HI> that we are brought under by the Co|venant of God from our <HI>Infancy,</HI> and by our <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> then, is this in the <HI>Text, That the Lord &s;hall be our God.</HI> This 'tis, and neither more nor le&s;s; as God gave it to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and as it is come on us, Gen. 17.7. <HI>And I will e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant betwen me and thee, and thy &s;eed after thee in their generations, to be a God to thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee.</HI> We and our &s;eed therefore have &s;ignificantly &s;aid <HI>of</HI> and <HI>to</HI> the Lord, <HI>He &s;hall be my God. Jacob</HI> now &s;aid for him&s;elf, no more than what his Father <HI>I&s;aac</HI> had &s;aid for him, and bound upon him, in the day when he circumci&s;ed him. The Covenant is now given to us in the &s;ame Words, Heb. 8.20. <HI>I will be to you a God, and ye &s;hall be to me a people.</HI> This is the compendium, the &s;ummary and
<PB N="7" REF="002325_0008_0FDB11DA856C5610">&s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>Covenant of Grace;</HI> comprehending all the mercy, grace, favour and ble&s;&s;ing promi&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>God's part</HI> in the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and all the duty and obedience required and engaged <HI>on ours.</HI> So ex|ceeding <HI>broad</HI> are the&s;e few words, <HI>The Lord &s;hall be my God.</HI> The Covenant Engagement which our <HI>Infants</HI> are brought under in their Bapti&s;m, is this in the Text, <HI>The Lord &s;hall be my God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">OUR Children &s;hould be <HI>early taught</HI> this, and often admoni&s;hed of it by their parents; <HI>and as they grow up &s;hould be put on a &s;erious preparation to take this Vow upon them&s;elves, and make it their own Act.</HI></P>
<P>IT &s;hould be the care of parents early to in&s;truct their Children in the Covenant Bonds to God which they are under, and to charge them with the &s;erious remembrance of them, and to prepare as they grow up to recognize the &s;ame. The mother of <HI>Solomon</HI> did &s;o by him; &s;he taught him that he was <HI>the &s;on of her vows,</HI> and under a holy dedication to God.</P>
<P>AND as Children arrive at Years of under&s;tanding, the fir&s;t thing that &s;hould be prepared for, and &s;eriou&s;ly done by them is this, the taking their Bapti&s;mal Cove|nant on them&s;elves, and giving them&s;elves up to God.</P>
<P>IT was your Parents Act in your Bapti&s;m, and they did well to bring you to God in his appointed Way, and under his holy Bonds: they had right, power and authority to do as they did; they did but their Duty to God and to you: they can oblige you in other things, and can't they in this, that the Lord &s;hall be your God? they can Act for you in your name to Men, and bind you for your good; and why not to God? The Mother of <HI>Samuel</HI> vow'd him to God before he was conceived within her; and he religiou&s;ly &s;tood to her Act.</P>
<P>OUR Children owe it to God and to their Parents, and to the Church of Chri&s;t, to abide by their Bapti&s;m, and join them&s;elves to the Lord in an everla&s;ting Co|venant, by their own Act and Deed. In this, if in any thing they <HI>obey their parents in the Lord;</HI> and wherein can they more profanely and impiou&s;ly de&s;pi&s;e and re|fu&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="002325_0009_0FDB250389163F88">to obey them, than if they abide not by the Cove|nant Dedication that they made of them to God from their Birth-Could your Parents do better for you than they did? or can you do better for your &s;elves than to &s;tand to their pious Act in your behalf, and in obedience to God who gave you to them? If they did ill by thee you &s;hall not be obliged by it; but if well, why &s;hould you depart from it?</P>
<P>CAN there be a more direct Way to the great End of thy Being, (the Glory of God from thee, in thy own everla&s;ting Happine&s;s) than thy kapri&s;mal Decicati|on from the Womb, and thy early Recogaition thereof, in uprightne&s;s and with &s;olemnity? Thy <HI>Saviour</HI> was &s;o circumci&s;ed and pre&s;eated in the <HI>Temple</HI> according to the Law, and <HI>at twelve Years old he went up with his parents to the Pa&s;&s;over:</HI> And <HI>wi&s;t you not</HI> that you too &s;hould be betimes <HI>about your heavenly Father's Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and careful for your own Souls Salvation? <HI>remembering your Creator in the Days of your youth,</HI> and <HI>&s;ecking him early?</HI></P>
<P>OUR baptized Children are obliged actually, formal|ly and explicitly, to a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent to the Covenant of Grace when they come to years; to chu&s;e the Lord to &s;erve him, and let them refu&s;e at their peril! it were Athei&s;m, bla&s;phemy and rebellion in them to reject their Fathers God and de&s;pi&s;e his Covenant; and it were Damnation to them to do it. Yet it is fit|ting to put it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> them, as <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> did to <HI>I&s;rael; Jo&s;h.</HI> 24.14, 15. <HI>Now therefore fear ye the Lord, and &s;erve him in &s;incerity and in truth; and if it &s;eem evil to you, chu&s;e you this day whom you will &s;erve.</HI> So <HI>Mo&s;es when he was come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;eriou&s;ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Knowledge of God and of his Covenant) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to be called the Son of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Daughter,</HI> ca&s;ting his lot among the People of God.

<P>HERE I will chu&s;e to propo&s;e, and make &s;ome An|&s;wer to the&s;e three Enquiries.

<P>TO &s;ay unto God that He &s;hall be our God implies,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of his rightful propriety in us, and Dominon over us, and our indi&s;pen&s;able obligation to be his, only and wholly, for ever to wor&s;hip, obey and glorify him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It &s;uppo&s;es to be &s;ure a <HI>rejection</HI> and abjuration of all things be&s;ides God; our &s;elves and the fle&s;h, the world and the devil, the &s;ervice of Sin and Satan, and all fal&s;e Gods e&s;pecially, and fal&s;e Wor|&s;hip.</ITEM>

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To be &s;ure <HI>not re&s;hly, &s;uddenly, light|ly,</HI> and without &s;erious con&s;ideration of the thing, and preparation for it; and &s;ome good grounds to hope that God has given us a heart to &s;ay it in a right manner. Our danger is ra&s;hne&s;s, and youth is prone to be &s;udden and confident. Let <HI>Solomor's</HI> Caution therefore be ever kept in mind, and ly with weight upon us, Eccl. 5.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Be not ra&s;h with thy mouth to utter any thing before God,</HI> and in vowing to him. Be &s;en&s;ible and fearful of thy <HI>wicked and deceitful heart,</HI> and <HI>jealous over thy &s;elf with a godly jealou&s;y.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THEREFORE, 2. Be very <HI>&s;erious, deliberate, &s;olemn</HI> in a tran&s;action of this nature; con&s;ider of it, and pray over it, and continue in prayer: Implore the Divine Grace to make thee upright and keep thee &s;o; commit thy &s;elf to it, and make trial of thy &s;elf if thy heart a|bide with God, if his Spirit in his ble&s;&s;ed Influences be with thee; and after &s;ome happy experience hereof, in a growing humility for &s;in, watch again&s;t it, de&s;ires af|ter holine&s;s, delight in prayer, meditation, and reading God's word, and a fixed purpo&s;e of heart (tru&s;ting in God) to govern your &s;elf by it all your dayes, you may humbly renew your Vows to God, and your Covenant with him. And 1. Do it very &s;eriou&s;ly in <HI>&s;ecret</HI> before
<PB N="11" REF="002325_0012_0FDB250B141DC3D8">the Lord; and 2. <HI>Openly</HI> and &s;olemnly before the peo|ple of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>VERY &s;eriou&s;ly in &s;ecret;</HI> after much prayer, and &s;ome good time of experience, and rea&s;on to hope that thy heart is &s;incere with God; as I &s;aid before. Enter then into thy clo&s;et, and fall on thy knees before thy Father which &s;ees in &s;ecret: Beg of him to accept of thee in Chri&s;t, to po&s;&s;e&s;s thee by his Spirit, to &s;anctify thee to his &s;ervice and glory, to &s;eal to thee the par|don of &s;in, to &s;hed abroad of his love in thy &s;oul, to make thee fear always; to &s;earch thee and know thy heart, to try thee and know thy thoughts, and &s;ee if there be any wicked thing in thee, and to lead thee in the way everla&s;ting. And having done this &s;eriou&s;ly in &s;ecret, then</P>
<P N="2">2. PROCEED to do it <HI>openly,</HI> in publick, in the face of the World: Go to thy <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> who is required by Chri&s;t to feed his lambs, lay open thy reader and ho|ne&s;t heart before him, receive with reverence his in|&s;tructions, coun&s;el and advice in the matter, his ad|monitions and charges from God; let him receive thy profe&s;&s;ions and lay them before the Church of Chri&s;t; and join (yea give) thy &s;elf to the people of God, chu|&s;ing them for thy people, and their God for thy God.</P>
<P>THIS was the primitive way, 2 Cor. 8.5. <HI>They fir&s;t gave their own &s;elves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this manner <HI>our Fathers,</HI> in the&s;e Churches of our <HI>Lord Je&s;us,</HI> from the beginning of this land, fir&s;t took the Lord to be their God, and then gave their Po&s;terity to him; taking the Scripture for their rule and directory in this matter; and we ari&s;e and declare it to our children, that they might &s;et their hope in God, and do his Commands. We would call upon them and change them as <HI>David</HI> did his <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 Chron. 28. 9. <HI>And thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy fa|ther, and &s;erve him,</HI> &amp;c. And we take comfort in tho&s;e of our children, who in the manner before de&s;cribed have given, or do give them&s;elves to the Lord, as their God. And now I &s;uppo&s;e I need not &s;pend many more

<P>NO more will he to any of the believing, praying <HI>&s;eed of I&s;rael,</HI> who &s;et him always before them, and who&s;e &s;pirits are &s;tedfa&s;t with him: Who ever eye him in his governing Providence, ordering and di&s;po&s;ing eve|ry thing that befals them; and in every thing by pray|er and &s;upplication with thank&s;giving make their reque&s;ts known unto him; who rely on him for con|duct, &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s in their affairs, and a&s;cribe all they receive to him; who thus daily are giving glory to him, and &s;taying them&s;elves on him; who thus keep up a con&s;tant communion with God under every pro|vidence, pro&s;perous or adver&s;e; walking humbly with him, and with a perfect heart before him, as the al|mighty &amp; al&s;ufficient God.

<PB N="19" REF="002325_0020_0FDB251D2E65FDA0">and wor&s;hip him according to his word all our days, and to honour him with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and worthy part of out e&s;tate.</P>
<P>AND now, what remains but in a particular man|ner to apply my &s;elf, and all that I have &s;aid, to the <HI>SON of this Family,</HI> who gave me the&s;e words of the <HI>Patriarch Jacob</HI> to &s;peak from, for his own pre&s;ent In|&s;truction and Admonition. I have done the part you de&s;ired of me as God has helped me: <HI>You</HI> mu&s;t now do your part, by the help of God, in receiving and im|proving what has been &s;aid. You are &s;en&s;ible that you were brought under the <HI>Vow</HI> and bond of God in your <HI>Infancy,</HI> and it is <HI>this</HI> which you have given me to &s;peak of, <HI>That the Lord &s;hall be your God.</HI> You were early taught this, and have been earne&s;tly admoni&s;he&s;t of it, as well <HI>at home</HI> (I &s;uppo&s;e) as from the <HI>Pulpit.</HI> You have &s;omething more than two years pa&s;t &s;olemn|ly <HI>taken</HI> this Vow upon your &s;elf and made it to the Lord before his people; And now that you are leaving your Parents hou&s;e, and going abroad into the world you have ask'd our <HI>prayers</HI> to God with you, and that <HI>this Word</HI> of God might be preached unto you; by which it appears to me that you think the holy God <HI>calls you on this Occa&s;ion</HI> to remember &s;eriou&s;ly and <HI>re|vow the Dedication and Surrender of your &s;elf to Him,</HI> Imploring his divine pre&s;ence with you in the way be|fore you, to guide and keep you. And now, <HI>my Son, the Lord be with thee &amp; pro&s;per thee. The God before whom Jacob walked</HI> be with you, as one of his Spiritual Seed. Ask Grace of God to do as <HI>be</HI> did. Be <HI>diligent</HI> in your lawful Bu&s;ine&s;s, and <HI>faithful</HI> to tho&s;e that imploy you: <HI>Jacob</HI> was &s;o. <HI>Moderate</HI> your de&s;ires after worldly wealth; as <HI>Jacob</HI> here did. Remember your <HI>Country</HI> and the religion of it, the Doctrine, precepts, and wor|&s;hip of God you have been educated in, and have found (I hope) the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in. De&s;ire to <HI>return</HI> to it, by the will of God and in his time, to &s;erve and en|joy God in it; and be a Ble&s;&s;ing to it. Let a tender <HI>filial piety</HI> toward your good <HI>Mother,</HI> (under who&s;e care|ful wing you have grown up, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> you are ve|ry

She is making <HI>her Vows</HI> with you this day to God for <HI>this mer|cy.</HI> You may find God <HI>pro&s;pering</HI> you in your Affairs, as <HI>Jacob</HI> did, but let not that keep you from returning <HI>to the land of thy Eathers and of thy kindred.</HI> Or you may meet with <HI>hard&s;hips, injuries and wrongs,</HI> as <HI>Ja|cob</HI> did; let the&s;e <HI>ha&s;ten you home,</HI> as they did him. If any <HI>Laban</HI> reproach thy <HI>longing after thy father's hou&s;e</HI> and the Hou&s;e of God here, regard it not. But if it plea&s;e God <HI>to be with you in your way and bring you again in peace,</HI> according to your pre&s;ent prayer be|fore him, take heed that you no not <HI>&s;eem to forget,</HI> or at all <HI>delay</HI> the paying of thy <HI>Vow,</HI> as <HI>Jacob</HI> did. God keep it in thy mind, and put thee in remembrance of it, as He did him; and upon his doing &s;o, be thou <HI>obedient</HI> to the Heavenly motion as he was, Gen. 35. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, 3. <HI>And God &s;aid unto Jacob, Ari&s;e, go up to Bethel and dwell there, and make there an Altar to God that ap|peared unto thee.
