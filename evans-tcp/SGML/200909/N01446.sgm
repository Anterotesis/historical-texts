They are to be urged to <HI>Reformation:</HI> their duty in this matter is to be particular|ly pre&s;&s;ed upon them, their Con&s;ciences mu&s;t be &s;tirred to part with all &s;in, as Chri&s;t ur|ged the <HI>Jews,</HI> Mat. 5.29. <HI>If thy right eye of|fend thee pluck it out.</HI> For the neglect of Reformation will put a &s;top to the work, &amp;c they will not get forward in the work of <HI>Humiliation,</HI> till they are Reformed; as the fir&s;t Concoction prepares for the &s;econd, &s;o Reformation does for Humiliation: Men mu&s;t overcome the next and more <HI>immediate</HI> difficulties before they overcome tho&s;e that are <HI>remote:</HI> he that will not part with &s;inful practices, will not yield him&s;elf into the hands of Ju&s;tice: if they don't reform, they put the work to a &s;tand; yea, &s;uch men do aggra|vate their own &s;orrows, for trouble will lie upon them, till their hearts are brought to be humbled, and their terrours will be mul|tiplied, if they belong to God, till they are per&s;waded to reform: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 32.3. <HI>When I</HI>

<P>Sometimes &s;ome <HI>particular &s;in</HI> lies exceeding heavy upon his heart. In this Ca&s;e the Mi|ni&s;ter may tell him,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is not his duty in ordinary ca|&s;es <HI>to publi&s;h &s;uch &s;in to him,</HI> it's &s;it he &s;hould con&s;e&s;s it to God; but ordinarily there is no ju&s;t occa&s;ion to publi&s;h a &s;candal to him; it is be&s;t that &s;ecret &s;ins be kept &s;ecret, ex|cept the circum&s;tances of the per&s;on do call for the making of it known.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>&s;in is pardonable:</HI> This he may demon&s;trate from &s;everal examples in the Scripture; from the &s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t's Redemption; from &s;everal Offers and Promi|&s;es of the Go&s;pel, that the mans heart may not &s;ink with di&s;couragement.</P>
<P N="3">3. That in ca&s;e the Rule does call for <HI>any &s;atisfaction to men,</HI> he mu&s;t not delay that, but that mu&s;t be attended as &s;oon as there is opportunity; if he can make &s;atisfaction without confe&s;&s;ion, there is no nece&s;&s;ity of confe&s;&s;ion; for &s;atisfaction an&s;wers for the wrong that has been done to man.</P>
<P N="4">4. That he mu&s;t not be &s;en&s;ible of that <HI>&s;in only,</HI> but <HI>of all other &s;ins;</HI> every &s;in being provoking to God, and de&s;erving damnation: and particularly that his Impenitency and Unbelief is more dangerous than any former act of &s;in: Joh. 3.19. <HI>This is the condemnati|on that light is come into the world, and men love darkne&s;s rather than light</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001716_0028_0FB74C4E9D5235D8">
Sometimes after the man has been in trou|ble a while, before he has any great experi|ence of his own heart, he has <HI>&s;ome promi&s;es come to him with a great deal of refre&s;hing:</HI> and he hopes God has accepted him; in this ca&s;e the Mini&s;ter may tell him,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is a <HI>common thing</HI> for God to give <HI>encouragements</HI> unto men, before they are carri|ed thorow the work of Conver&s;ion; that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God gives them incouragements by his <HI>Word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> &s;o he does many times by his <HI>Spirit:</HI> God al|ways maintains in the hearts of Sinners that are &s;eeking of him, &s;ome hopes that they may obtain mercy: and &s;ometimes he gives them very great refre&s;hing, by &s;ome &s;en&s;e of the Glo|ry of Heaven, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.15. by &s;ome fuper&s;icial di&s;coveries of Chri&s;t: <HI>Mat.</HI> 13:20. thereby holding forth &s;ome promi&s;es before them, the de&s;ign whereof is to draw them on in a way of &s;eeking, and to &s;upport them under their temp|tations.</P>
<P N="2">2. That God <HI>never gives a Faith of A&s;&s;urance,</HI> before he gives <HI>a Faith of Dependance;</HI> for he never manife&s;ts his <HI>love till men are in a state</HI> of Favour and Reconciliation, which is by a faith of dependance. When men have comfortable Scriptures come to them, they are apt to take them as tokens of Gods love: but men mu&s;t fir&s;t be brought into Chri&s;t, by accepting the Offer of the Go&s;pel before they are fit for &s;uch manife&s;tations. Gods method is fir&s;t to make the &s;oul accept of the Offers of Grace, and
<PB N="10" REF="001716_0029_0FB74C5057EDFDE8">then to manife&s;t his good E&s;tate unto him.</P>
<P N="3">3. That if his Comfort be not of the right kind, <HI>it will not continue:</HI> And u&s;ually after &s;uch encouragements, mens terrours are wont to re|turn with as much violence as ever. God com|monly intermingles <HI>&s;miles</HI> and <HI>frowns,</HI> and if &s;uch vain confidences as men took up from re|fre&s;hing Scriptures, be but nipped in the bud, they generally quickly wither away; and their fears return as &s;trong as ever.</P>
<P>WHEN the Sinner that was hoping he was in a good E&s;tate, becau&s;e &s;ome refre&s;hing Scrip|tures came to him, &s;ees his mi&s;take, he is in <HI>danger to be di&s;couraged.</HI> In this ca&s;e he may be told,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is a <HI>common thing</HI> for per&s;ons that are afterwards Converted, <HI>to pa&s;s thorow &s;uch Changes;</HI> it is not a peculiar thing to him, but a thing of ordinary experience in &s;uch people as God is about to deliver out of a Natural E|&s;tate. They commonly have &s;ome light&s;ome times, and then returns of darkne&s;s: there was no rea&s;on to expect that that &s;hould la&s;t very long; &s;uch comforts are like <HI>Jonahs Goard,</HI> that ri&s;e in a night, and peri&s;h in a night.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it is a <HI>great mercy that tho&s;e confiden|ces are taken away from him;</HI> had they continu|ed, they would have ruined him; fal&s;e confi|dence is better lo&s;t than kept. His condition is the more hopeful now tho&s;e confidences are lo&s;t; while he had tho&s;e confidences he was like a Ship that &s;tuck in the Sand, and now he
<PB N="11" REF="001716_0030_0FB74C522233CC60">is delivered from them, there is more ground of encouragement.</P>
<P>AFTER he has had affection and inlarge|ments <HI>for a while,</HI> he is wont to complain that he <HI>grows more dull,</HI> and he is afraid that his Convictions are about to leave him: In this Ca&s;e he may be told,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there is no rea&s;on to expect that his Convictions &s;hould always be in the like degree.</HI> Per&s;ons in &s;uch a Condition, are &s;ubject to ma|ny alterations, as it is with a Ship at Sea, &s;ome|times it has a fair Wind, &s;ometimes it blows more moderately, &s;ometimes it is becalmed; yea, &s;ometimes it has Storms and cro&s;s Winds: There be many Changes that pa&s;s over &s;uch men. So men in a Journey, have &s;ometimes good way, &s;ometimes bad; they meet with Rivers and miery places, where they cannot make &s;peed.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That he must be very careful that he do no|thing to quench the motions of the Spirit,</HI> 1 The&s;. 5.19. There be many ways whereby men do it, &s;ometimes by di&s;couragement, &s;ometimes by pre&s;umption and flattery, &s;ometimes by rebel|ling again&s;t the light, &s;ometimes by <HI>Company|keeping.</HI> Men that are much addicted to compa|ny, do commonly lo&s;e the&s;e Convictions; &s;o by crouding them&s;elves with <HI>Worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s:</HI> tho' diligence be no hindrance, yet combring of them&s;elves will be a great impediment to the abiding of Convictions.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That it is his best way to improve the Con|victions
<PB N="12" REF="001716_0031_0FB74C5A56133AD8">that he has.</HI> Sometimes per&s;ons are wont to argue, that it will be to no purpo&s;e for them to &s;trive. If they have not greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Convictions, they &s;hall but tire them&s;elves to no purpo&s;e; and they conceive it be&s;t for them to tarry, till they have &s;tronger Convictions a but the <HI>Seaman</HI> is wont to hoi&s;t his Sails, and improve the Wind he has, whether it be le&s;s or more: if men improve moderate Convicti|ons, they may get forward, and do that which will further their Conver&s;ion: and if they do improve le&s;&s;er Convictions, that is the way to have more: it is their duty to do it, and in that way God owns them; <HI>to him that hath &s;hall be given.</HI> Some that have complained of the &s;mallne&s;s of their Convictions, have within a while changed their note, and complained as much of the greatne&s;s of them, that they have been &s;uch, that they could hardly live under them.</P>
<P>A Per&s;on that is under the work of Con|ver&s;ion, is &s;ubject to many affrightments, and <HI>di&s;couraging</HI> TEMPTATIONS, a dreadful &s;ound is in his Ears: all &s;uch per&s;ons have not the &s;ame temptations, and they have them not in any certain order; but care mu&s;t be taken to give &s;uitable &s;upport and advi&s;e to them accor|ding to the <HI>variety</HI> of their temptations. ONE TEMPTATION is, That he is <HI>not</HI> ELECT|ED; but God has Overlooked him, and ap|pointed him to Condemnation; this &s;ometimes lies upon the heart with great weight: In this Ca&s;e he may be told,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="13" REF="001716_0032_0FB74C5E12F19818">
1. <HI>That tho&s;e things that make him fear that he is not Elected, are no certain &s;igns of it, there be no certain tokens of reprobation upon him.</HI> Tho&s;e things that he takes to be &s;igns are very, uncer|tain; the <HI>greatne&s;s of his &s;ins</HI> don't argue Repro|bation: Many that have been guilty of great Sins have been Elected. His being of <HI>Elderly years</HI> don't argue it; &s;ometime God turns &s;uch to him&s;elf, <HI>Mal.</HI> 4.5, 6. Gods leaving of him &s;till in a Natural E&s;tate, though he has &s;ought God a long while does not &s;hew it; <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was a great while travelling from <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Canaan.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That it is a &s;inful thing for him to draw any conclu&s;ions about his Election.</HI> It is a &s;ecret re|&s;erved in Gods own Brea&s;t, and he cannot de|termine any thing under&s;tandingly about it: <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.29. <HI>Secret things belong unto the Lord our God.</HI> When he undertakes to conclude that he is not Elected, he <HI>acts pre&s;umptuou&s;ly:</HI> his conclu&s;ion may be fal&s;e for ought he knows; he pretends to know what he is ignorant of.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That Gods striving with him by his Spirit, is an hopeful &s;ign that he is Elected, for many times is is the fruit of Election.</HI> When the Spirit con|vinces of Sin, it is in order to his <HI>convincing of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Joh.</HI> 16.8. This is the cour&s;e that God is wont to take with tho&s;e that are Elect|ed; frequently he lets Reprobates live in &s;ecu|rity, but he is wont to terrifie the Elect in or|der to their Conver&s;ion; and the more earne&s;t|ly the man follows after God, and labours to get into a Converted Condition, the more
<PB N="14" REF="001716_0033_0FB74C5F5C7840F8">hopeful it is that God has Elected him; for where God has appointed the end, he has ap|pointed the means al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Another</HI> TEMPTATION is, That he has committed the UNPARDONABLE SIN; that he has committed the Sin again&s;t the <HI>Ho|ly Ghost,</HI> that Sin which is <HI>unto Death,</HI> he has carried badly after Illuminations, and it &s;inks into him, <HI>that now there is no remedy.</HI></P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e he may be told, That it has been <HI>a frequent thing for men to fear</HI> that they have committed this Sin, who have afterward been Converted; that it is <HI>not the manner</HI> of tho&s;e that have committed that Sin, to be per|plexed and exerci&s;ed with fears about it; but the principal way to help in this Ca&s;e, is to <HI>inform him from the Word of God,</HI> what this Sin is; particularly he may be informed,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is an <HI>External Sin,</HI> not a Sin that is committed in the heart; men have &s;ome wicked thoughts after enlightnings, and then fear that they have been guilty of that &s;in; but that is an outward &s;in, it is a &s;in that <HI>other men may &s;ee,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.16.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it is a <HI>Cour&s;e of Sin,</HI> not any particu|lar act of &s;in, which a man breaks off from, and is troubled for, but a way of evil that he does continue impenitently in.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is one particular &s;ort of &s;in, com|mitted with great aggravations; namely, <HI>A rejecting of the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel:</HI> There be many other grievous &s;ins, but none of them
<PB N="15" REF="001716_0034_0FB74C60EE4133A8">however aggravated, are the <HI>Unpardonable Sin;</HI> it is a rejecting of the Truth of the Go&s;pel, and renouncing the Profe&s;&s;ion thereof: they are &s;aid to <HI>fail away,</HI> Hebr. 6.6. they are &s;aid <HI>to for&s;ake the A&s;&s;emblies of the People of God, Heb.</HI> 10.25. they are &s;aid <HI>to tread under feet the Son of God;</HI> and <HI>to deny their Bapti&s;m, Heb.</HI> 10.29. So that if any per&s;on among us &s;hould turn <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> or <HI>Heathen,</HI> having a bla&s;|phemous &s;pirit again&s;t the Ways of God, and a bloody per&s;ecuting &s;pirit towards the Peo|ple of God, there might be rea&s;on to fear that he was guilty of the Unpardonable Sin; but there be no foot&s;teps in the <HI>Scripture</HI> to judge that men that are following after God, and labouring to get into a Converted Con|dition, have committed that Sin, tho' they are guilty of much Unbelief, of many de|cays and back&s;lidings, and of very vile tho'ts and ri&s;ings of heart; for multitudes of men that have been guilty of &s;uch things, have had experience afterwards of the Pardoning Grace of God.</P>
<P><HI>Another</HI> TEMPTATION is, <HI>that his day of Grace is past;</HI> he had a time when he might have obtained Mercy, but he has let it &s;lip, and it is in vain for him to &s;trive: In this Ca&s;e the <HI>Minister</HI> may tell him,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it is a common device of Satan, when he can't per&s;wade men that it is too &s;oon, then to per&s;wade them that it is too late.</HI> He is &s;et
<PB N="16" REF="001716_0035_0FB74C6BF29280B0">to hinder men from u&s;ing of means; and fir&s;t he tells them <HI>that there is no ba&s;te;</HI> and when that temptation will do no longer, then he changes his voice, and tells them that the <HI>&s;ea&s;on is gone.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That there is no &s;uch Doctrine in the Scripture that any &s;ort of mens day of grace is pa&s;t, before the day of life is past, except they be guilty of the Unpardonable Sin.</HI> It is taught in the Scrip|ture, that God will &s;trive with &s;ome men, only a limited time, and then de&s;troy them, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3. <HI>My Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man, yet his days &s;hall be an hundred and twenty years.</HI> It is al&s;o taught, that God does harden &s;ome Na|tions in order to great mi&s;ery, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 6.10, 11. and &s;ometimes in order to their <HI>Unchurching, Joh.</HI> 12.40. It is al&s;o taught, that God may harden &s;ome particular per&s;ons before Death, and never more &s;trive with them in any re|markable way. <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.11. <HI>Let him that in filthy, be filthy &s;till:</HI> But there is no &s;uch thing taught, that there is any &s;ort of men that may be de&s;cribed, or any particular per&s;on that may be known unto him&s;elf or others, who&s;e day of grace can be &s;aid to be pa&s;t before his death. When men &s;ay their day is pa&s;t, they only fear, they do not know it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That &s;uch Scriptures as &s;eem to evidence th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their day is past, do not determine any &s;uch thing</HI> it is &s;aid, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29.1. <HI>that he that being often reproved, hardneth his neck, &s;hall &s;uddenly be
<PB N="17" REF="001716_0036_0FB74C6DAAE0F1A8">de&s;troyed.</HI> But it is evident, that God waits longer upon &s;ome per&s;ons than upon others: Some Threatnings are <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> and &s;ome are <HI>indefinite:</HI> &s;hewing what God does many times do; &s;o it is &s;aid, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.28. <HI>If any man draw back, my &s;oul &s;hall have no plea&s;ure in him;</HI> but the Back&s;liding here &s;poken of &s;eems to be the <HI>Unpardonable Sin;</HI> he had been &s;peaking of that, <HI>ver.</HI> 26. and &s;eems here to have refe|rence to the &s;ame &s;in; for in other ca&s;es God does &s;peak incouragingly in his Word unto <HI>Back&s;liders,</HI> Jer. 3.22. <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 14.4.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Temptations mentioned, there is ANOTHER SORT of Temptations that are very exerci&s;ing to him, his Con&s;cience be|ing guilty, he is much &s;ubject to frights.</P>
<P N="1">1. One Temptation is, That he &s;hall be left to <HI>&s;ome great and dreadful &s;ins.</HI> In this Ca&s;e he may be told by the Mini&s;ter,</P>
<P N="1">1. That one &s;pecial rea&s;on of the&s;e fears is that he <HI>&s;ees more of the badne&s;s of his heart</HI> than formerly; Men under troubles of Con&s;cience, are wont to &s;ee much of the Corruption of their hearts, and they &s;ee that which is &s;uffici|ent to lead them to all &s;orts of wickedne&s;s; and becau&s;e God is angry with them, they are afraid he will not keep them, but avenge him&s;elf on them, by leaving them to &s;uch wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. That God is now &s;triving with him in order to his Eternal Good; God is exerci&s;ing
<PB N="18" REF="001716_0037_0FB74C6F1338D660">a great deal of mercy, and he has no cau&s;e to conclude that God will &s;o leave him; though God might ju&s;tly do it, yet he has rea&s;on <HI>to hope in God</HI> to pre&s;erve him.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is fit he &s;hould be humbled under the &s;en&s;e of the depravedne&s;s of his nature, &amp; be &s;enfible of the in&s;ufficiency of his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to bring him into the Favour of God, his heart being a &s;ink of all manner of Sin; he can never be ju&s;tified but by the per|fect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. That his be&s;t way is to make ha&s;te <HI>to get into a Converted Condition.</HI> If he were once Converted, he would not be in &s;o much dan|ger to fall into <HI>great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions;</HI> becau&s;e he would have then an holy principle to re&s;i&s;t temptations to Sin; and then he would have an Intere&s;t in the Favour of God; &amp; it would be more hopeful that God would pre&s;erve him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Another Temptation</HI> is, That he <HI>&s;hall get a fal&s;e hope,</HI> and &s;o &s;atisfie him&s;elf that he is in a good E&s;tate, when he is far from it; he under|&s;tands that it is &s;o with many: <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.12. <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17. In this Ca&s;e the Mini&s;ter may tell him,</P>
<P N="1">1. That he is <HI>indeed in danger of it,</HI> both be|cau&s;e of the pride of his &s;pirit, ready to mag|nifie his own performances; and becau&s;e of his fears of Hell, the tediou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e fears make him ready to catch at any appearances of Conver&s;ion, and therefore he had need be ex|ceeding
<PB N="19" REF="001716_0038_0FB74C7097213038">careful; it is good for him <HI>to under|stand what Conver&s;ion is,</HI> and what <HI>Preparation</HI> there mu&s;t be in order thereunto; and if there be appearances to him at any time as if he were Converted, his way is to examine them thorow|ly, and get the help of &s;ome that are skilful before he &s;ettle him&s;elf much in that per&s;wa&s;i|on.</P>
<P N="2">2. That he mu&s;t <HI>leave him&s;elf as to that mat|ter in the Hands of God:</HI> it is beyond his own power to deliver him&s;elf: if God delight in him, he will carry him through all the difficul|ties of the Work, and &s;hew him the right way; it may be God may have purpo&s;es of grace to him, and if &s;o, he will <HI>&s;hew him the path of life.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Another Temptation is,</HI> That <HI>Satan will ap|pear to him.</HI> This is a great terrour to him; e&s;|pecially he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this fear when he withdraws him&s;elf to <HI>Secret Prayers:</HI> &s;ometimes this makes him neglect his duty, &s;ometimes it makes him attend it with di&s;traction. In this Ca&s;e the Mini&s;ter may tell him,</P>
<P N="1">1. That he is <HI>under Gods keeping;</HI> and that when he is doing his duty, he is under God's protection. There is le&s;s rea&s;on to be afraid of <HI>Satans appearing</HI> at that time, than at many o|ther times; it is not Gods manner to &s;uffer Sa|tan to appear at &s;uch times.</P>
<P N="2">2. That if Satan had power and liberty to appear to him, it is not probable, that he would fright him with the expectations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="20" REF="001716_0039_0FB74C77F6748D40">it; he would not give &s;uch notice of his co|ming; but his de&s;ign in terrifying of him, is to prevent him from doing that which might be &s;erviceable to his Soul.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is too much honour to Satan, to be &s;o far out-bid with the temptation, as to change the time of his prayer; but if he can|not attend his duty &s;uitably, and the temptati|on do prove too overbearing to him, it is bet|ter to attend the duty by day-light.</P>
<P>I may add to this Ca&s;e <HI>another</HI> that now and then happens, that he &s;ays he has heard <HI>&s;ome voice, &s;een &s;ome &s;hape, felt &s;omething on him;</HI> this I apprehend at lea&s;t &s;ometimes to be only the effect of <HI>strong imagination:</HI> a <HI>&s;trong fancy</HI> may make men to imagine &s;uch things; as it is with per&s;ons in <HI>their dreams,</HI> and with <HI>distracted per|&s;ons;</HI> all Sen&s;ation is in the brain, and there|fore by &s;ome di&s;order of that, men may think they &s;ee, feel, or hear things which they do not &s;ee, feel or hear.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Another Temptation is,</HI> That it is be&s;t <HI>to de&s;troy him&s;elf;</HI> many have been urged to this, &s;ome have attempted it, and &s;ome have performed it, as <HI>Judas</HI> did. In this Ca&s;e the Mini&s;ter may tell him,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Devil is very active in this temp|tation,</HI> though he has that in his own heart, that may lead him to it; yet it's Satan that &s;tirs him up thereunto. The Devil entred into <HI>Judas</HI> when he betrayed Chri&s;t, and was
<PB N="21" REF="001716_0040_0FB74C7B17FFB510">not gone out of him when he de&s;troyed him|&s;elf. The Devil has a <HI>double de&s;ign</HI> in it; <HI>one is</HI> to &s;ecure the man, he is afraid he &s;hall lo&s;e him, now he is troubled about his Condition, and is taking pains for Salvation. Satan is jealous le&s;t he will e&s;cape out of his hands, and labours to make him de&s;troy him&s;elf, that he may pre&s;ently &s;ecure him, then there will be no danger of his running away. <HI>The other de|&s;ign</HI> is to bring a reproach upon trouble of Con|&s;cience, and di&s;courage others from giving way to Convictions. If there be but one &s;uch In|&s;tance in a <HI>Town,</HI> that will make many others to &s;tifle Convictions, le&s;t they &s;hould come to the like End.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there is <HI>good rea&s;on to hope that he may obtain Salvation.</HI> It is di&s;couragement that leads men to &s;uch practices: And if he have but con&s;iderable hope of obtaining peace with God, there is not much danger of his hearken|ing to the temptation; therefore &s;uch things may be &s;ugge&s;ted, as are proper to bear up his heart, as that the Spirit of God is &s;triving with him in order to his Salvation; that Satan is afraid he will be &s;aved, that his &s;ins are no other than what God has pardoned oftentimes, and the like.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is a <HI>dreadful &s;in to de&s;troy him&s;elf.</HI> It is a &s;in again&s;t nature, it is unthankfulne&s;s for Gods mercy in &s;aving his life; that this is far wor&s;e than other &s;ins that are very terrifying
<PB N="22" REF="001716_0041_0FB74C7C9C08F8B0">to him; this is the way to throw him&s;elf im|mediately <HI>into endle&s;s mi&s;ery.</HI> Whatever may be &s;aid of the po&s;&s;ibility of the Salvation of &s;uch per&s;ons, there is no rea&s;on to think that one in a thou&s;and is &s;aved; this &s;in is heinous, and quickly cuts off their opportunities: Such a man as is tempted to this Sin, would be a|fraid to <HI>tell a lye,</HI> or to <HI>prophane the Sabbath;</HI> how much more has he rea&s;on to fear this &s;in, which will bring him pre&s;ently to Eternal Damnation? It is a poor remedy to deliver him&s;elf from angui&s;h, to throw him&s;elf into that, which is un&s;peakably greater; certain damnation is far more dreadful than the fears they are oppre&s;&s;ed by: this will make their condition much wor&s;e, and not better.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES he complains of a <HI>&s;elf-righ|teous Spirit;</HI> that he is ready to tru&s;t to every thing he does: that e&s;pecially when he feels any affections, he is proud of them, and ready to make a righteou&s;ne&s;s of them: In this Ca&s;e it may be profitable,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To convince him of the in&s;ufficiency of his own righteou&s;ne&s;s to &s;ave him:</HI> that his own righte|ou&s;ne&s;s will not bring him into favour with God; for his own righteou&s;ne&s;s is utterly im|perfect, and &s;o falls &s;hort of what the Law re|quireth. The Law &s;tands for perfect Obedi|ence, but he never did perform one perfect act of Obedience: all his Obedience is &s;tained with Corruption. Be&s;ides, while he is in a
<PB N="23" REF="001716_0042_0FB74C7F51FA5738">Natural Condition, he does nothing &s;incerely, but is an Hypocrite in all his performances; and accordingly God is &s;o far from ju&s;tifying of him for the &s;ake of them, that he will not accept of him, but holds him guilty for the &s;ake of them. Be&s;ides, his own righteou&s;ne&s;s han't the nature of &s;atisfaction in it; there can be <HI>no &s;atisfaction for &s;in, but by bearing the Cur&s;e of the Law.</HI> Obedience is a natural debt, and cannot &s;atisfie for his contracted debts; if our Obedience would have procured our ac|ceptance, there would have been no need of the Death of Chri&s;t: Chri&s;t's Death would be in vain, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.21.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To direct him how to get delivered from this &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit,</HI> viz. <HI>by getting an understan|ding of the badne&s;s of his own heart:</HI> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t him hear never &s;o often of the vanity of his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet he will tru&s;t to it, till he &s;ees he has none, and can get none.

<P>SOMETIMES he complains that he does <HI>e|very thing from a &s;pirit of &s;elf-love:</HI> he don't aim
<PB N="24" REF="001716_0043_0FB74C806DF51B30">at the Glory of God in any thing; <HI>but fear of Hell, and de&s;ire of Salvation,</HI> are the great things that do &s;et him on work: were it not for fear of Hell he &s;hould leave off. In this Ca&s;e he may be told,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould act from at higher principle.</HI> He has no principle of love to God, <HI>Job.</HI> 5.42. Self-love is the reigning prin|ciple in him, and therefore it is no wonder that he does all in Religion from that &s;pirit; it was his weakne&s;s that he formerly thought he did any thing out of love to God. No Natural man ever did act with an higher &s;pirit, then a &s;pirit of &s;elf-love: <HI>A bad Tree cannot bring forth good fruit.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That he &s;hould make u&s;e of this for Humilia|tion, and not for Di&s;couragement.</HI> There is no rea&s;on that he &s;hould be di&s;couraged becau&s;e of this, for every one is an Hypocrite at fir&s;t; and many that have &s;ought God for a while with a &s;elfi&s;h-&s;pirit, have afterward been turned, and have had another &s;pirit given to them: but he &s;hould make u&s;e of this to his Humili|ation, and learn hereby his own badne&s;s, the in&s;ufficiency of his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the ju&s;tice of his Condemnation, and that he has no cau&s;e to think much that God does reject his Services, and not give peace unto him.</P>
<P>After this the Sinner gives an account that he finds a <HI>&s;pirit of love to God, &s;orrow for
<PB N="25" REF="001716_0044_0FB74C831C1139F8">Sin, aiming at the Glory of God, hating of Sin, &amp;c.</HI> In this Ca&s;e he may be told,</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is a <HI>great re&s;emblance between common and &s;aving Grace:</HI> Common Grace is the picture of Sanctifying Grace, and common af|fections are &s;ometimes &s;tronger than &s;aving. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> ju&s;tifies God, <HI>Saul</HI> weeps, <HI>one</HI> who was far from &s;incerity, tells Chri&s;t, <HI>he will follow him whither&s;oever he goeth,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> cry, <HI>Ho&s;anna to the Son of David,</HI> the <HI>I&s;raelites &s;ang Gods prai&s;e, but &s;oon forgat his works.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That while they have &s;uch pangs of affection, it will be very hard for them to &s;ee their Hypocri&s;ie.</HI> Their fear of Damnation makes them catch at any appearances of &s;incerity, and their pride makes them have an high opinion of their at|tainments; men &s;ometimes in that frame make &s;uch &s;igns as do indeed &s;hew their hypo|cri&s;ie to be arguments of their &s;incerity.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That it is a very dangerous thing for them to think that they are &s;incere, while they are not:</HI> then they will ble&s;s them&s;elves, when God cur&s;es them; then they will continue quietly in a Natural Condition, and neglect the means of Conver&s;ion: and if they don't &s;ee the deceit quickly, there is danger that they may grow &s;o hard-hearted, that if they do &s;ee it afterwards, they will not be the better for it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That they may be &s;atisfied from &s;uch things as the&s;e, that they don't love God &s;incerely, whatever appearances there be,</HI> viz. <HI>That they never had a
<PB N="26" REF="001716_0045_0FB74C8781CF8810">work of Humiliation;</HI> and &s;incerity does never forego that: that they never <HI>Clo&s;ed with Je&s;us Christ,</HI> and the heart is never <HI>purified without Faith.</HI> All tho&s;e affections that go before faith, let them be never &s;o &s;trong, are deceitful; the fir&s;t good action that any man does perform, is to give entertainment to the Go&s;pel: other things follow upon that.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES he gives an account, <HI>that he does believe on Je&s;us Christ;</HI> he don't tru&s;t in his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, but places his hope in Chri&s;t. In this Ca&s;e the Mini&s;ter may tell him,</P>
<P>That there is a great deal of faith that does not ju&s;tifie. Some do believe for a time, <HI>Luke</HI> 8.13. <HI>&s;ome receive the word with joy, and in time of temptation fall away,</HI> Mat. 13.20, 21. Some <HI>believed on Christ, but did not confe&s;s him, Job.</HI> 12.42. &s;everal <HI>&s;orts of faith</HI> do not <HI>justifie:</HI> As,</P>
<P N="1">1. An <HI>Hi&s;torical Faith.</HI> Men do receive the <HI>History of the Go&s;pel</HI> for a truth, and take it for granted, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God, and Saviour of the World; and if any &s;hould deny it, or di&s;pute again&s;t it, they would be ve|ry zealous again&s;t him, it would &s;tir up their indignation; if they have any workings of in|fidelity, yet generally they go with that per|&s;wa&s;ion, <HI>that the Go&s;pel is true;</HI> but this is no more than a <HI>Turk</HI> will &s;ay for his Religion: this <HI>Hi&s;torical Faith,</HI> don't mortifie mens corrupti|ons. <HI>John</HI> 2.23, 24, 25. many profane man have this Hi&s;torical Faith.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="27" REF="001716_0046_0FB74C89C172AE88">
2. <HI>A con&s;iderable confidence that Christ will &s;ave them.</HI> They are per&s;waded that they &s;hall obtain Salvation by Chri&s;t, and do re|joyce in the hope of it: This Confidence is a di&s;tinct thing from Ju&s;tifying Faith; it is <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad</HI> according to the <HI>grounds</HI> of it. Godly men have frequently &s;uch a confidence from the experience of a work of Grace in their own hearts, and the manife&s;tation of the Love of God; but this is not <HI>Ju&s;tifying Faith,</HI> but a <HI>Faith of A&s;&s;urance.</HI> Carnal Men may have &s;uch a confidence, ari&s;ing from an imagination that God loves them, and from a &s;en&s;e of their own goodne&s;s; but this is not <HI>Justifying Faith,</HI> but <HI>Pre&s;umption.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A depending upon Christ, on the incou|ragement of a mans own goodne&s;s.</HI> He hears the Go&s;pel, or has &s;ome common Illuminati|on, di&s;covering &s;omewhat of God's readine&s;s to pardon Sinners through Chri&s;t: and con|&s;idering what he is, he ventures on Chri&s;t.

<PB N="28" REF="001716_0047_0FB74C90F2829A60">of Christ</HI> the foundation of his Faith; he does not exclude the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, but the preponderating con&s;ideration, and that which e&s;pecially imboldens him to venture, is his own righteou&s;ne&s;s; his own righteou&s;ne&s;s is the fir&s;t foundation of his hope, though he takes in the plea al&s;o of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; he &s;ees enough in Chri&s;t for &s;uch an one as him&s;elf, but not for the wor&s;t of Sinners.</P>
<P>But po&s;&s;ibly he will plead for him&s;elf, That he was <HI>much affected with Christ,</HI> and with the mercy of God, it was more than ordinary, he never had &s;uch a light before. In this Ca&s;e he may be told, That Carnal men have &s;ometimes &s;uperficial di&s;coveries of Chri&s;t, and are affect|ed therewith, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.20. men have con&s;ide|rable <HI>inlightnings and tasts, yet may fall away;</HI> and it is no wonder they &s;hould be affected with the mercy of God: if men do apprehend that God has pardoned them, they cannot but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> affected with it: as pardon does affect men, &s;o does Imaginary pardon.</P>
<P>He may further plead for him&s;elf, That it was <HI>ju&s;t &s;o with him, as it has been with Godly men,</HI> as he has heard them to expre&s;s them&s;elves; that all his objections were an&s;wered; he was backward before, but he had &s;uch a di&s;covery of Chri&s;t, that <HI>all his objections did vani&s;h away,</HI> and he had nothing to &s;ay.</P>
<P>But he may be told, that the rea&s;on why
<PB N="29" REF="001716_0048_0FB74C925318FA20">&s;ome mens objections are all an&s;wered, is not from the greatne&s;s of the light that God gave them, but <HI>from their ignorance of their own hearts.</HI> They did not &s;ee &s;o much of their own bad|ne&s;s, as thorowly to feel the power of an ob|jecting &s;pirit; if they had &s;een how bad they were, their objections would not have been an|&s;wered.

<P>SOMETIMES he builds his Confidence up|on &s;ome PARTICULAR SCRIPTURES.</P>
<P>ONE <HI>Scripture</HI> is, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.14. <HI>We know that we are pa&s;&s;ed from death to life, becau&s;e we love the brethren:</HI> He &s;ays he finds &s;uch a &s;pirit in him&s;elf, and he thinks his Condition good. But he may be told,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a great difference between loving the People of God for their Plety, and honouring them for their Piety.</HI> Many Natural men have &s;ome Convictions that Godly men are choice men, and happy men; and if they think a man is a &s;incere man, they <HI>honour</HI> him, and have a re&s;pect for him; &s;o <HI>Herod</HI> had for <HI>John, Mark</HI> 6.20. but the&s;e men have not a &s;incere love to them for their Piety; they don't love God nor Godline&s;s, therefore don't love Godly men for their Piety.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="30" REF="001716_0049_0FB74C93E0226508">
2. <HI>There is a great difference between loving Godly men for their Piety, and loving them for their Morality.</HI> Godly men are moral men &s;ome of them are eminent for Ju&s;tice, Sobriety and Faithfulne&s;s, and the&s;e are very lovely things in the eyes of many natural men; they love them upon that account, <HI>Dan.</HI> 6.3.18. <HI>Darius</HI> had a great love to <HI>Daniel,</HI> but it was not upon the account of his Piety, but his Prudence and Morality: Morality is lovely in the eyes of many carnal men.

<P>Another Scripture that he may build a con|fidence on, is, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.11. <HI>Who&s;oever believeth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, is born of God.</HI> By this Rule he &s;ays he is in a good condition, he does believe this, therefore is Regenerate. In this Ca&s;e he may be told,</P>
<P>That the believing here &s;poken of, is the receiving of it as <HI>certain upon the te&s;timony of God.</HI> Many men have a common per&s;wa&s;ion that Chri&s;t is the Son of God from <HI>tradition,</HI> and from <HI>his Miracles,</HI> which is in a more ge|neral
<PB N="31" REF="001716_0050_0FB74C9BE7D27928">acceptation called believing. <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.23. and yet they are not <HI>born of God:</HI> but more properly they are &s;aid to believe it, who receive it, upon God's te&s;timony; and tho&s;e men who have only a <HI>common per&s;wa&s;ion,</HI> are indeed Unbe|lievers; they that have not Grace, don't pro|perly believe the Word of God.</P>
<P>ANOTHER <HI>Scripture</HI> that he takes notice of to &s;trengthen his confidence, is, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.6. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that hunger and thirst after Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> his Con&s;cience te&s;tifies that he does &s;o, therefore he hopes he is ble&s;&s;ed. In this Ca&s;e he may be told,</P>
<P>That though <HI>&s;ome</HI> de&s;ires of grace are grace, yet <HI>all de&s;ires</HI> of grace are not grace: As men may act hypocritically when they pretend to de&s;ire grace, &s;o when they do de&s;ire grace. For</P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>That it is his be&s;t way to &s;earch his own heart further.</HI> Many times men will complain bit|terly of the badne&s;s of their own hearts, and one time after another give an account that they have &s;een more in their hearts than over they did before; and yet are far from &s;eeing what they mu&s;t &s;ee in their own hearts.

<P N="3">3. <HI>To po&s;&s;e&s;s them that God is very angry with them, notwithstanding the pains they take.</HI> For one great rea&s;on why they make no more pro|ficiency is, becau&s;e they live upon their Duties; though they don't think that their Duties do ju&s;tifie them, yet they do pacifie their Con&s;ci|ences with them; and they think that God will have a re&s;pect to the pains they take: they do what they can, and they do more than &s;ome others; and they hope they &s;tand upon better terms with God than formerly; and though they &s;peak of their own badne&s;s, yet they i|magine &s;o much of their own goodne&s;s, as that they think it will be an <HI>hard ca&s;e for God to damn them:</HI> Therefore they &s;hould be convin|ced upon what terms they &s;tand with God; that as there is no merit in their duties, &s;o there is nothing to move God to pity them, nor to abate the anger of God towards them; but their be&s;t duties are provocations, and impated to them as &s;ins.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES a man that has been <HI>in a very hopeful way</HI> quickly to get through the work of Conver&s;ion, <HI>returns again to his old postures;</HI> he had of late great Convictions of the badne&s;s of his own heart, the hypocri&s;ie of his duties, the in&s;ufficiency of any thing of his own to gain Gods favour, and has &s;uch workings of heart as are wont immediately to procure &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion

<P>SOMETIMES he is <HI>afraid that his Convicti|ons are not like the Convictions of other men, and he hath &s;everal arguments</HI> to &s;trengthen tho&s;e fears.</P>
<P><HI>One Argument</HI> is, that his Convictions are only the <HI>workings of natural Con&s;cience,</HI> and not from the <HI>Spirit of God:</HI> his Convictions are from the workings of his own thoughts; but he may be told, the way of the Spirits work|ing when it does convince men, is <HI>by inlightning natural Con&s;cience;</HI> the Spirit does <HI>not work by giving a testimony,</HI> but by <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;ting natural Con&s;ci|ence</HI> to do its work: Natural Con&s;cience is the in&s;trument in the hand of God to accu&s;e, con|demn, terrifie, and to urge to duty: The Spi|rit of God leads men into the con&s;ideration of their danger, and make them to be affected therewith, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20.27. <HI>The &s;pirit of man is the candle of the Lord, &s;earching all the inward parts of the belly.</HI> When men's own hearts are &s;tir|ring
<PB N="53" REF="001716_0072_0FB74CDE276A39A8">them up to Sin, &amp; they have many rea&s;o|nings about it, that is no &s;ign that <HI>Satan</HI> is not bu&s;ie with them: So when their own hearts are accu&s;ing and frighting of them, it is no &s;ign that the Spirit of God is not at work with them: All the regular actings of Con&s;cience, all tho&s;e Convictions that are <HI>according to the Word of God,</HI> are from the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Argument</HI> is, that his <HI>terrors are not &s;o great as other mens.</HI> Many others have &s;uch terrors that they are &s;wallowed up therewith, almo&s;t di&s;tracted; all the <HI>Town</HI> may take <HI>notice</HI> of it; but his terrors are more moderate by far: But he may be told,</P>
<P>That there is <HI>great diver&s;ity in the degrees of mens trouble:</HI> Every man mu&s;t have &s;o much trouble, as to make him &s;trive earne&s;tly after Salvation, and do what he can do in order to it; &s;o much as to make him thorowly to <HI>Re|form,</HI> and <HI>earne&s;tly to strive</HI> to get into a Con|verted Condition. Every <HI>Ship</HI> that performs its Voyage, mu&s;t have &s;o much Wind as may make the <HI>Ship</HI> Sail; but &s;ome <HI>Ships</HI> have &s;tron|ger and more tempe&s;tuous winds than others have. Some men are of more tender &s;pirit, &amp; le&s;s will prevail upon them, than upon others; and &s;ome men who&s;e troubles are but &s;mall at the beginning, do grow afterwards to a great height: God u&s;es his <HI>Sovereignty</HI> very much as to the degree of mens trouble.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Argument</HI> is, <HI>that his terror did not
<PB N="54" REF="001716_0073_0FB74CE0531E8418">begin when other mens did.</HI> Many others have been &s;mitten in the <HI>Preaching of the Word,</HI> the Word of God has been like a <HI>&s;harp &s;word</HI> in their heart; but his troubles came from the <HI>examples of others,</HI> or from &s;ome <HI>affliction,</HI> or from his <HI>fall into &s;ome &s;in:</HI> But he may be told,</P>
<P>That <HI>it is all one from what occa&s;ion his troubles did ari&s;e, provided that he be but convinced of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;ent Reconciliation, and be but earnest in his endeavours after that:</HI> Though the Word be a principal means of Conver&s;ion, yet God may ble&s;s what means he will to do the work, <HI>Luke.</HI> 3.10, 12, 14. <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.24. Examples fails, and Afflictions have a great tendency this way. Whatever be the means of mens Reformation, yet if men be re|formed it is well: God would have men to make u&s;e of <HI>Providences</HI> as well as <HI>Ordinances,</HI> there is a <HI>voice of God in them, Mic.</HI> 6.9.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Argument</HI> is, <HI>Becau&s;e he does not &s;ee the evil of Sin.</HI> He &s;ees a great deal of danger, <HI>but he does</HI> not &s;ee the evil of &s;in, he thinks that other men &s;ee more than he &s;ees; but he may be told,</P>
<P><HI>That other men do never &s;ee the great evil of &s;in, until they are Converted.</HI> Men may &s;ee a <HI>moral</HI> evil in &s;in, and a great deal of the vanity and folly of it, though they are not under a <HI>prepa|ratory</HI> work of the Spirit; but they never come to &s;ee the great evil of &s;in, until they are Converted. Men have not a Spiritual Under|&s;tanding
<PB N="55" REF="001716_0074_0FB74CE1D1A5AB70">given them, till they are Converted; they don't hate &s;in, until they are Converted; &s;o long as they remain under the preparatory work of the Spirit, no &s;uch things can be ex|pected from them, as are <HI>peculiar to Saints:</HI> When once men come to &s;ee the evil of &s;in, they al&s;o &s;ee the Glory of God; they do mor|tify their &s;ins, and are brought into a &s;tate of Sanctification.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Argument</HI> is, <HI>Becau&s;e he don't pro&s;|per in his &s;eekings;</HI> he has been &s;eeking a long time, and yet God &s;tands at a di&s;tance from him, other men get thro' it quickly; &s;ome that began a long time &s;ince him, have obtain|ed <HI>peace with God,</HI> but he is left yet in a deplo|rable condition: But he may be told,</P>
<P><HI>That it is a common thing with God to Convert &s;ome in a far &s;horter time than others.</HI> One Ship may &s;pend twice as much time as another in performing the &s;ame Voyage; one mans di&s;ea&s;e may be broke in far le&s;s time than another mans. Some men has more temptations and hindrances than others; the Spirit pur&s;ues &s;ome men more clo&s;ely than others; and tho&s;e that are longer under the work, may be as &s;oundly Converted at la&s;t. The great rea&s;on why men do not hitherto pro&s;per in their &s;eekings, is not that their fir&s;t troubles were not like the trou|bles of other men, but becau&s;e they <HI>tru&s;t in their own righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and are not yet con|vinced
<PB N="56" REF="001716_0075_0FB74CE919A9A038">of their own helple&s;s condition, and the badne&s;s of their own hearts.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>But are not &s;ome mens Convictions and Terrors Saving? Is there not a difference all along in the terrors of them that are Elect, and them that are Reprobate?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> There <HI>is no difference for a great while between the strivings of the Spirit in tho&s;e that &s;hall be Converted, and in tho&s;e that &s;hall not.</HI> As there may be no difference in the Voyages of two Ships for a pretty while, one of which at la&s;t arrives in the Harbour, and the other is Ca&s;t-a|way; So it is here. Tho&s;e that &s;hall never be Converted, may have the &s;ame experiences for a con&s;iderable time, that tho&s;e have that &s;hall be Converted; there may be no difference in their <HI>Awakenings,</HI> in their <HI>Reformations,</HI> in their <HI>Temptations,</HI> in their <HI>Encouragments,</HI> nor in re|&s;pect of their <HI>Frames.</HI> This does appear,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e tho&s;e &s;trivings that men may have, that &s;hall never be Converted, are &s;ufficient to bring men forward towards Christ.</HI> There is no nece&s;|&s;ity at all, that the Elect &s;hould have any o|ther &s;trivings for a time, than what are com|mon to Reprobates; the Convictions that Re|probates may have, are &s;ufficient to bring men forward towards Chri&s;t; tho&s;e terrors that Re|probates may have, are &s;ufficient to wean them from the World, to make them reform their lives, and labour to be Converted. If men have but &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of Hell as many Reprobates
<PB N="57" REF="001716_0076_0FB74CEAD5E141E0">have had, there is no danger but they will take pains to be &s;aved, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78.34. Tho' this will not Convert them, yet it will bring them <HI>near|er to the Kingdom of God,</HI> then they were; it will make them travel towards Chri&s;t, and o|vercome &s;everal impediments that lay in the way of their Conver&s;ion; though they don't &s;ee the great evil of &s;in, yet they will be afraid of it; though they don't &s;ee the excellency of Holine&s;s, yet they will &s;eek after it: Common Convictions are a preparation for Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They that are to be Converted, are not capa|ble of any &s;trivings of the Spirit, but what are com|mon, till they come to be humbled, and to believe.</HI> It is a pritty while after God begins to &s;trive with the Elect, before they come to be hum|bled, and to believe in Chri&s;t; and before that, they are not capable of any &s;trivings, but what are common. What can there be, but what is common to other men?

They are not capable yet to &s;ee the evil of Sin, the excellency of Chri&s;t, nor of godly &s;orrow, nor of &s;incere de&s;ires, becau&s;e they are not Converted. Why may not a Reprobate have as much Conviction as they? What are they capable
<PB N="58" REF="001716_0077_0FB74CED91CB1590">of in their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, but what many have had that are now in Hell? Some &s;peak of a <HI>Saving Conviction, and Contrition;</HI> What is it? if it be only of Hell &amp; Wrath, Reprobates have &s;uch as well as they; it can't be the great evil of &s;in, for none can &s;ee that, but they that are Converted: Na|tural men are blind, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If there be a difference, men might be a|ble to tell what the difference is, and apply it.</HI> There is a difference between <HI>common grace</HI> and <HI>&s;aving grace,</HI> and we are able to give an account what it is: So if there were a difference be|tween the Convictions of the Elect and Repro|bate, we might be able from the Word of God to tell what the difference is; if ordinary men could not do it, yet it might be expected, that &s;uch as have a deeper in&s;ight into the Scrip|tures &s;hould: There God gives us Rules to di&s;cern the difference that is in his Di&s;pen&s;ati|ons; but no man in the world is able to tell what Convictions of Wrath and Hell are pecu|liar to Elect Sinners, and what are peculiar to Reprobates. Can we di&s;tingui&s;h them by their kinds, by their degree, by their continuance, by their immediate effects? What Rules have we to guide us in this matter? And can we make an application to per&s;ons? If Sinners give us a true account of their terrors, can we tell one that his Convictions are &s;uch as are proper to the Elect, and they will end in Conver&s;ion;

<P N="1">1. <HI>That men in many ca&s;es have a power to appoint others to repre&s;ent them;</HI> and they are accordingly bound to &s;tand or fall according to the carriage of tho&s;e <HI>Repre&s;entatives.</HI> Yea,
<PB N="64" REF="001716_0083_0FB74D00031AE818">men have a power to make Repre&s;entatives <HI>for others;</HI> the&s;e things are common in matters of a Civil Nature.

<P N="2">2. <HI>That this was a fair and probable way for the good of Mankind;</HI> it was as hopeful a way as for every man to &s;tand for <HI>him&s;elf:</HI> There was le&s;s likelihood that all <HI>Adams</HI> Po&s;terity &s;hould &s;tand, then that he &s;hould &s;tand; not only from the per&s;onal qualifications of <HI>Adam,</HI> which were certainly greater than his Po&s;terity would have had in the time of their Childhood; but becau&s;e <HI>Adam</HI> was under an exceeding great Bond, he had a great Charge upon him; the Happine&s;s of all his Po&s;terity having a great dependance upon his Carriage. <HI>Adam</HI> had not only the care of his own Soul upon him, but he &s;tood intru&s;ted for many Millions that were to di&s;cend from him; and it was proba|ble, that that Con&s;ideration &s;hould make him more careful to keep Gods <HI>Covenant.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>It was very meet that God &s;hould appoint a puni&s;hment that was &s;uitable for the vindication of his Name.</HI> God loves him&s;elf, and his Name is dear to him; and it becomes God to annex &s;uch a penalty to his Law, as that his <HI>Great Name</HI> might be vindicated: God is a Great God, and therefore Sin is a <HI>great Evil;</HI> and it is very fit that if &s;in be puni&s;hed, there be a puni&s;hment appointed &s;ome ways proportiona|ble to the great evil of Sin.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That by Gods appointing &s;o dreadful a pu|ni&s;hment, he makes no man mi&s;erable.</HI> God holds out the point of a &s;word, this will do them no hurt if they don't run again&s;t it: God makes a dreadful pit, this will hurt no man if he don't run into it: <HI>Gods Law makes no man mi&s;erable;</HI> they make them&s;elves mi&s;erable, and are <HI>cruel to their own Souls,</HI> when they &s;in again&s;t him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The puni&s;hment appointed for &s;in, is no greater than the recompence of Obedience.</HI> There is an <HI>equality</HI> in the Law, the Law is as bountiful to the Obedient, as &s;evere to the Di&s;obedient: If the Law did appoint little rewards of Obedi|ence, and great puni&s;hments of Di&s;obedience, men would have more &s;hew for their com|plaints, but the reward is as great as the

<P N="4">4. If he OBJECTS, That <HI>God has &s;hewed mercy to others that have not taken &s;o much pains as he:</HI> God pardons others, and gives grace to others, but denies him. He may be told.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That his Labour and Service does lay no bond upon God to &s;hew mercy to him.</HI> Whatever he has pretended in his Prayers, he has no true regard to the Glory of God, he has minded nothing higher than his own Salvation; he has been &s;erving him&s;elf, and not God. God is no ways obliged to give him &s;uch a reward, he has not merited grace, but has merited Condemnation by &s;uch &s;ervices: There is no|thing in &s;uch &s;ervices to work upon the mercy of God; God's mercy is not moved by any ex|ternal thing, there is nothing in tho&s;e Services to ingage the <HI>Ju&s;tice of God,</HI> they are far from being meritorious; there is nothing to engage the <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> of God: God has made no ab|&s;olute promi&s;es to any hypocritical prayers.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That God has a liberty to bestow his Grace upon whom he will.</HI> Mercy is Gods own, and he will make choice who &s;hall be the &s;ubjects of it. God is ma&s;ter of his own gifts, will be|&s;tow them upon one, and deny them to others. It is ju&s;t for God to deny all Sinners Saving Mercy, but if he plea&s;es to have mercy upon &s;ome, none may pre&s;cribe who they &s;hall be; but he may chu&s;e one, and refu&s;e another, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.7.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>That if he does what he can, he may not chal|lenge mercy from thence.</HI> By what Law will he demand &s;aving grace becau&s;e of that?

<P N="3">3. <HI>That &s;eeming willingne&s;s that is in many men is but feigned.</HI> They pretend a willingne&s;s to quiet their Con&s;ciences; they don't it may be feel much oppo&s;ition, but they are not indeed willing; they are willing to be &s;aved, and wil|ling to be &s;aved by Chri&s;t, rather than not be &s;aved at all; and have &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ires that they could come to Chri&s;t, but there is no &s;in|cerity in them.</P>

<P>There be TWO particular CASES that do re|quire a particular Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The Fr&s;t CASE is, <HI>When the Mini&s;ter is &s;ent for by a man upon his Sick-bed.</HI> The fir&s;t thing to be done is to <HI>get an under&s;tanding in what condition the per&s;on is.</HI> For though a man that does not know his Ca&s;e may &s;peak &s;everal things that may be &s;afe and pro|fitable: whatever his Condition is; yet the more knowledge there is of the &s;tate of the man, the more <HI>advantage</HI> he is under to &s;peak pertinently.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> If it be plain that the man is in a <HI>Natoral Con|dition,</HI> it is mo&s;t proper to in&s;i&s;t upon the&s;e three things:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That he has a pre&s;ent ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to be at peace with God:</HI> that if he &s;hould dye in a Natural Condition, he will be for ever undone: It is very fit he
<PB N="90" REF="001716_0109_0FB74BF454938848">&s;hould be rememored of his &s;inful life, and the dreadfulne&s;s of that puni&s;hment that hangs over his head; which may be &s;et before him in an affecting manner, that if it be po&s;&s;ible he may be terrified, and made &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e Eternal Mi&s;eries that are coming upon him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That he may not re&s;t in any thing &s;hort of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n in &s;uch a Ca&s;e are like a man drown|ing, ready to catch hold of any thing that comes near; they are ready to have a dependance upon their Priviledges, upon their Parentage, upon their &s;orrow for their mi&s;pent life and upon their purpo&s;es to live better if God do rai&s;e them up again; he mu&s;t be led into an under&s;tanding of the <HI>&s;trictne&s;s of the Law of God</HI> and the <HI>vanity of all ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l confidences.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That there is a glorious way of Life prepared by Chri&s;t</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us has fulfilled the Law, &amp; wrought out Eternal Salvation for us, that the <HI>Gift of God is Eternal Life;</HI> and that the mercy of God is free, and God does not refu&s;e any that do hearken to the Call of the Go&s;pel, that God will as readily receive him if he comes to Chri&s;t, as if he were likely to live many years, and do &s;ervice to God in the World.</P>
<P>And if his particular temptations may be di&s;cern|ed, care mu&s;t be taken to remove them; if he be un|der any <HI>&s;pecial di&s;couragement</HI> or any <HI>flattering delu&s;ion,</HI> the &s;nare if it be po&s;&s;ible mu&s;t be broken; he mu&s;t be &s;hewed the <HI>vanity of that temptation.</HI> Such light mu&s;t be held out, that if God will ble&s;s it he may be delivered.</P>
<P>If at that time, or any other afterwards he does <HI>pretend to believe in Chri&s;t,</HI> it is very meet that he be <HI>cautioned</HI> that he does not <HI>deceive him&s;elf; for &s;ick-bed Repensances are &s;eldom true.</HI> Many per&s;ons that made great preten&s;ions when &s;ick, have proved very badly after their recovery.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> If it be doubtful whether the man be in a Na|tural Condition, or Converted, as there may be &s;ome occu&s;ion to hope becau&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e of
<PB N="91" REF="001716_0110_0FB74BF6A95B7E70">his e&s;timation among men; becau&s;e of an orderly carriage, and yet occa&s;ion to fear, becau&s;e there is no great evidence of Grace, either in his Conver&s;ation before, or di&s;cour&s;e at pre&s;ent: Sometimes there is more grounds for hope, &s;ometimes for fear. The&s;e three things may &s;afely be &s;poken to him.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Doctrine of the Law and Go&s;pel may be &s;et be|fore him.</HI> They may be &s;omewhat explained and cleared up: It is fit men &s;hould be remembred of the Rule they are to be judged by. Many times when the Rule is clearly laid down. Con&s;cience makes ap|plication, and witne&s;&s;es to men how it is with them, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.12. <HI>The Word of God is quick and powerful, &s;har|per than any two-edged &s;word,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Promi&s;es may be applied conditionally.</HI> He may be told, That if he have been thorowly broken off from him&s;elf, and brought to rely upon Chri&s;t, God has accepted of him; that if his heart have been drawn by Go&s;pel Encouragements to rely on Chri&s;t, he is out of danger; that if Gods Glory be upon his heart indeed, he is an heir of Glory; he may be told, that only his own Con&s;cience can tell what the workings of his heart have been: That if he be not mi&s;taken, but has <HI>indeed made Chri&s;t his refuge, all his &s;ins are pardoned.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>He may be warned that he do not deceive him&s;elf.</HI> It may be meet to remember him, that the <HI>heart is deceitful;</HI> that many fal&s;e hearts do go hoping out of the World, that there be &s;everal things that do <HI>re|&s;emble</HI> Faith, and every Grace may be counterfeited: That he had need to <HI>beg of God</HI> to di&s;cover things plainly to him: That it would be a dreadful thing to be mi&s;taken; and &s;o he may be charged that he do not tru&s;t in any thing in him&s;elf, <HI>but betake him|&s;elf alone to Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> If it be con&s;iderably plain, that he is <HI>Converted and Gracious;</HI> either from his known eminency in Religion, or from an account that he gives of Com|munion with God, or di&s;coveries of Chri&s;t, and gra|cious workings of his heart: It may be very meet,
<PB N="92" REF="001716_0111_0FB74BF913240258">To <HI>comfort him</HI> with tho&s;e <HI>great and precious promi&s;es</HI> that God has made, to remember him of the freene&s;s of Gods Grace, and the preciou&s;ne&s;s of the Blood of Chri&s;t; he may be minded of tho&s;e things that are the pillars of our Faith, and the foundations of our comfort; how God in all Ages of the World has pro|po&s;ed this way of Salvation in this way the Saints of Old have lived and dyed: How the <HI>Faithfulne&s;s of God</HI> &s;tands engaged for their Salvation, that their &s;ins and iniquities <HI>are ca&s;t behind Gods back;</HI> this mu&s;t be under&s;tood or &s;poken upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that their work is a thorow work.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> he de&s;ires the <HI>Minister</HI> to tell <HI>what he judges about his &s;incerity;</HI> it may be &s;uitable to tell him, that as far as he can di&s;cern, his heart is upright, and that the root of the matter is found in him; he mu&s;t tell him that he has no infallible knowledge, God alone does know the hearts of men, there is no depending on his judgment, but &s;o far as he can perceive, his Soul has been re|newed by the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>If the man has any <HI>particular temptations,</HI> it is very &s;uitable to remove them; he may be under temptation, becau&s;e he has great deadne&s;s, a great deal of pride and hypocri|&s;ie; becau&s;e he has not had &s;o much d&s;co|very of the favour of God, as he perceives others have had; becau&s;e many others have been mi&s;taken; becau&s;e God has afflicted him very much; becau&s;e he is withdrawn now in the time of his Sickne&s;s: Such particular <HI>temptations</HI> are to be <HI>an&s;wered.</HI> It may be
<PB N="93" REF="001716_0112_0FB74BFA26E15A98">&s;hewed to him, that the dealings of God are various with his people; that &s;uch things are not incon&s;i&s;tent with Grace, that the be&s;t way is <HI>to live upon the free mercy of God in Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The OTHER CASE is, <HI>when &s;uch per&s;ons as have made an high profe&s;&s;ion of Religion for a long while, are in darkne&s;s</HI> about their Condition.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> the fir&s;t care of the Mini&s;ter mu&s;t be, <HI>to get &s;atisfaction concerning the state of the per&s;on,</HI> whether he be <HI>Regenerate</HI> or <HI>not.</HI> Not but that many things may be &s;poken that may be profitable to them, whether they be &s;incerely Godly or no: But if the Mini&s;ter do not know their condition, he can't apply <HI>proper remedies;</HI> and he may &s;peak that which may be very dangerous, if he &s;uppo&s;es the man to be Unconverted, when he is Convert|ed; he may torment him, and di&s;courage him needle&s;ly; if he &s;uppo&s;es the man Converted when he is not, he may do him much damage by comforting him up in a fal&s;e way; there|fore it is very needful that he do get what &s;a|tisfaction he can about their condition, that &s;o he may be helpful to them in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In order to his pa&s;&s;ing a right judgment up|on their condition, he mu&s;t be <HI>careful that he do not lay too much weight upon it,</HI> that they have been in <HI>Church-fellow&s;hip</HI> many years, that their <HI>Carriage has been orderly,</HI> that they are <HI>well ac|counted of where they live,</HI> for the&s;e are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>fallible &s;igns,</HI> &s;uch things are common to <HI>Saints</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="001716_0113_0FB74BFBECD737B0">and <HI>Hypocrites;</HI> though the&s;e things may be <HI>grounds of Charity;</HI> but a Mini&s;ter had need have better grounds to go upon when he com|forts up per&s;ons with <HI>hopes of Reconciliation.</HI></P>
<P>Neither mu&s;t he lay too much weight on <HI>bad &s;igns,</HI> that are <HI>not demon&s;trative;</HI> if the man do not know the time of his Conver&s;ion, or fir&s;t clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, if he have any notable blemi&s;h, if he be not well accounted of, the Mini&s;ter may not draw any peremptory con|clu&s;ion from thence that he is not Godly; yea, if he do judge him&s;elf confidently to be Uncon|verted, it is be&s;t to enquire &s;omewhat further in it. It is be&s;t di&s;covered by three &s;orts of <HI>Enquiries.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Whether they have pa&s;&s;ed thorow the &s;everal &s;teps of the work of Conver&s;ion.</HI> Some can give &s;o full an account thereof, as will abundantly &s;atisfie the Mini&s;ter, that the work is right; &s;ome are &s;o &s;trangely to &s;eek, that he may be much confirmed, that they have no grace; in &s;ome others after they have given what ac|count they can, the work is more dubious.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Whether they have lived a life of Sanctifica|tion.</HI> There is great diver&s;ity in the mea&s;ures of Sanctification that men have attained unto: very Holy men live an holy life, and by En|quiring what knowledge they have of God? Whether they prize the Glory of God? Whe|ther they hate all Sin? Whether they do draw their encouragement from Chri&s;t? Whe|ther
<PB N="95" REF="001716_0114_0FB74BFD62222CA8">they love Holine&s;s, for Holine&s;s &s;ake? What Conflict they have with Pride, Un|belief, a &s;elf-righteous Spirit and Self-love? A Mini&s;ter may come to comptent &s;atisfacti|on whether they be in a &s;tate of Grace or not; in di&s;cour&s;ing &s;uch things with them, a man may many times feel the workings of a &s;pirit of Holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Whether they have had &s;en&s;ible Communi|on with God.</HI> God is wont at times to draw nigh to the Souls of his People, &s;ometimes in <HI>Meditation,</HI> &s;ometimes in <HI>Prayer,</HI> and in other <HI>Ordinances;</HI> and to make di&s;coveries of him|&s;elf, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to their Souls, and to draw their hearts to him; and if there has been any thing con&s;iderable that way; the Mini&s;ter may be well &s;atisfied of their good E&s;tate.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> the Mini&s;ter be &s;atisfied that the man is not <HI>Converted,</HI> he mu&s;t u&s;e his prudence to judge whether it will be for the mans profit, that he do in plain Terms tell him &s;o; &s;ome|times it may be a prejudice and a means to exa&s;perate him. Sometimes there is no &s;uch danger, but he may freely tell him what he judges, and the rea&s;ons of his jugment.</P>
<P>But in ca&s;e he do not &s;ee it his way to tell the man his thoughts concerning him, yet he ought in con&s;cience in the wi&s;e&s;t way he can, <HI>put him into the understanding of his own condition:</HI> He may not &s;uffer the
<PB N="96" REF="001716_0115_0FB74C0160459CA8">man to go away with an opinion, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inks well of him, much le&s;s may he leave him ignorant of &s;uch rules whereby he may come to under&s;tand his condition; it becomes him to lay &s;uch <HI>&s;igns of tryal</HI> be|fore him as are mo&s;t likely to bring him to &s;ight of him&s;elf, and convince him of his <HI>Dangerous Estate.</HI></P>
<P>In ca&s;e the Mini&s;ter be &s;atisfied on good grounds about the <HI>mans good Estate:</HI> He ought to endeavour to <HI>clear it up to the man,</HI> laying convincing light before him; and an&s;wering tho&s;e <HI>temptations</HI> that make it doubtful to the man him&s;elf; and al&s;o to direct him in &s;uch ways, wherein it is hopeful that God will help him and deli|ver him from his Temptations.</P>
