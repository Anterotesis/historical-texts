<P>I Direct this my Book to thee, without any regard to one Sect more than ano|ther, for the Unity and Fellow&s;hip of Gods People is Love, and this Love is the Bond of Perfectne&s;s, and by this Love &s;hall all men know that we are Chri&s;ts Di&s;ciples; and if this Love be with us and dwell in us, by it we &s;hall know that we are tran&s;lated from Death unto Life; for that Faith which purifies the Soul works by this Love, and by this Faith which works by Love, we come to have the Victory over the World.</P>

<P>What I have written in this Book to the Churches of Chri&s;t, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> I did pre&s;ent to the Mini&s;try of the &s;aid People in the time of a General Meeting at <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> de&s;iring of them it might be read to the Congregation at the &s;aid Meeting, and &s;o handed among them till it came to <HI>Will. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> and the re&s;t of their Mini&s;try.

<P>I have al&s;o added &s;omething more at the end of that Epi&s;tle which I pre&s;ented to them, to &s;how the difference between the <HI>Mini&s;tration of the Moral Law,</HI> (written in the hearts of all the Children of <HI>Adam</HI>) and of the <HI>Mini&s;tration of the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> (written on the heart of Gods Children by the Spirit of the living God) the one being the <HI>Light of Condemnation,</HI> the other being the <HI>Light of Life,</HI> or the <HI>Light of our Ju&s;ti|fication,</HI> through Faith in the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and both proceeding from one and the &s;elf-&s;ame God.</P>
<P>And as to what I have written to the <HI>Ob&s;ervers of the Seventh-Day Sabbath,</HI> The&s;e may certifie thee, that after it plea&s;ed God, through his rich Grace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to take away the Guilt of my Sins from my Con&s;cience, and to &s;end the Spirit of his Son into my heart, whereby he did reveal unto me his love, and his acceptance of me in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; this un&s;peakable Mercy did greatly engage my heart to love God, &amp; dili|gently to &s;earch the Scriptures, that there by I might know how to &s;erve God acceptably,

I thus upon diligent &s;earch of the Scrip|tures found that the Fir&s;t-Day Sabbath was no where commanded by any Law of God, and the Scripture telling me, Where no Law is there can be no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and that it is but vain to wor&s;hip God by mens Traditions, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.9. and al&s;o finding by Scripture, that there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Commandment for the keeping of the &s;eventh Day, I the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> openly labour'd on the fir&s;t Day of the Week, in faithfulne&s;s to God and my fellow Crea|ture, and &s;trictly kept the 4th Command|ment, which commanded labour on the fir&s;t Day of the Week, and required rest on the 7th. But I continuing a diligent &s;earcher of the holy Scriptures, and begging at the Throne of Grace for direction in the way of Truth, it plea&s;ed God to open my Under|&s;tanding, to under&s;tand the Scriptures, and to &s;ee that the 7th Day Sabbath was but a Sign (under the Law) of a Go&s;pel Re&s;t that Chri&s;t gives the Soul, and that the &s;hadow|ing part of the Law was nailed to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t: I could then no longer ob&s;erve the 7th Day Sabbath without defiling my Con&s;cience; for faith Chri&s;t, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.27.

<P><HI>Beloved Brethren in Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> Grace and Peace be unto you from God the Father, and from our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Son of the Father.</P>
<P>Since it hath plea&s;ed God of his much mercy and rich grace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who commanded the light to &s;hine out of dark|ne&s;s, who hath al&s;o &s;hined into my heart, and thereby hath given me the &s;ight and knowledg of tho&s;e things which the natural man cannot under&s;tand, I have been under

<P>I can truly &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, That I have many things to &s;ay concerning the Prie&s;thood of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but it is hard to be uttered, becau&s;e ye are dull of hearing divine and &s;piritual things; when indeed the heart and mind of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> are fixt on &s;piritual things, it is both life and peace to them, but when their hearts and minds are &s;et upon the ob&s;ervation of &s;ome outward Rudiments or &s;hadowing figures of the law, it brings death upon the &s;oul, be|cau&s;e the mind is &s;et upon the &s;hadows of heavenly things &amp; not upon Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who is the &s;ub&s;tance and head of all Princi|pality

<P>I am greatly &s;en&s;ible that the Man-hood of Chri&s;t is preached up and generaly con|fe&s;t and belived on, with a dead faith, from the report of the holy Scriptures; and in a carnal way rejoyced in, believing he is the Saviour of the World; but as to his divine nature, many Profe&s;&s;ors are &s;trangers to it, and know nothing of the power and vertue of it; for it is his divine nature that imputes the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God to us; it is his divine nature that quickens us, and &s;treng|theneth us again&s;t the power of &s;in; it is his divine nature that reveals to us our Ju&s;|tification, and that &s;anctifies us, and is our life, and light, and wi&s;dom, yea, the divine nature of Chri&s;t applies to us all the virtues of the Sufferings of his Man-hood, and there|by reveals to us, the truth of the hi&s;tory of the Scriptures about his Sufferings, &s;o that we can &s;et to our &s;eal that the Scripture is true.</P>
<P>I have written unto you, <HI>beloved Brethren,</HI> concerning the two Covenants, and do de&s;ire you in a Chri&s;tian love to &s;earch the Scrip|tures, and to &s;ee whether the&s;e things be &s;o or no.</P>

<PB N="65" REF="001232_0073_0FB17CC90F345198">that it might depart from him; the an&s;wer of the Lord to him, was, <HI>My Grace is &s;ufficient for thee, for my &s;trength is made perfect in weakne&s;s.</HI> Thus we may &s;ee how God was plea&s;ed to exerci&s;e <HI>Paul,</HI> to humble and aba&s;e him, under the fence of his own weak|ne&s;s and infirmities, and then in &s;hewing him mo&s;t graciou&s;ly his All-&s;ufficiency, in making his own &s;trength appear perfectly in <HI>Paul,</HI> and thereby giving him the Victory. From hence we may Note, That when Pride was in <HI>Paul</HI> he was under the buffeting War|fare, but when he was humbled under it, ann by it had learned Humility, then God revealed his perfect &s;trength in him, and gave him the Victory over the power of &s;in; and when <HI>Paul</HI> came thus to &s;ee his own weakne&s;s, not being able to with-&s;tand the power of &s;in, he was greatly aba&s;ed and humbled, and did glory in the &s;ight that he had obtained of him&s;elf: And thus he comes not to glory in him&s;elf, any otherwi&s;e than in the &s;ight that he had obtained of his own weakne&s;s and infirmities, that the power of Chri&s;t might re&s;t on him, by gi|ving him Gods perfect &s;trength, again&s;t the Motions of &s;in; and when <HI>Paul</HI> had attain|ed to this Learning, rightly to know his own weakne&s;s and infirmities, &s;o as to glory in them, being aba&s;ed in him&s;elf, lowly and
<PB N="66" REF="001232_0074_0FB17CC9E876D360">humble, and to know the Almighty Power of God, and his readine&s;s to help the humble and lowly in time of need; then did he come (as in the <HI>10th ver&s;e</HI>) to take plea&s;ure in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Nece&s;&s;i|ties, in Per&s;ecutions, and in Di&s;tre&s;&s;es for Chri&s;ts &s;ake; for when I am weak (&s;aith he) then am I &s;trong, that is, becau&s;e he &s;ees his own Weakne&s;s, and is humble and lowly in him&s;elf, but is &s;trong by Faith in God, whom he knows will give him the Victory; &s;o that when he is thus Weak in him&s;elf, then is he &s;trong in God by Faith.</P>
<P>From this recorded Experience of <HI>Paul,</HI> it is our Wi&s;dom to learn of Chri&s;t, who was meek and lowly in heart, and then we &s;hall find Re&s;t, as <HI>Paul</HI> did, by Gods perfect &s;trength that did appear in him, again&s;t the &s;trength and powerful Motions of Sin, un|der which Warfair he could not re&s;t quietly, for it was like a pricking Bryar or grieving Thom in the fle&s;h, which was &s;uffered of God &s;o to be, to teach him Humility, in &s;ee|ing his own Weakne&s;s and Gods Strength made perfect in him; and thus he comes to glory in tho&s;e two fore-mentioned things.

<P>Another Scripture which they wre&s;t, to defend the power and authority of &s;in, is 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.8 <HI>If we &s;ay that me have no &s;in, we deceive our &s;elves, and the Truth is not in us.</HI></P>
