</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THIS is the an&s;wer Chri&s;t made to a certain &s;cribe, whom after &s;ome conference, he found to be more knowing, at lea&s;t more ingenuous and fair in his conce&s;&s;ions and acknowledge|ments, as well as in his inquiries, than the others, who conver&s;ed with him. The others came not to be inlightened and in&s;tructed by Chri&s;t; for they, who had been in&s;tructed in all the learning of their law, did in the pride of their hearts &s;corn to be taught of him; but their de&s;ign was to in&s;nare him in their talk: Thus we are told, that certain of the Phari&s;ees and of the Herodians (being &s;ent by the re&s;t) came to him <HI>to catch him in his words,</HI> v. 13. which was by putting &s;ome en|&s;naring que&s;tions; that by his an&s;wers they might get &s;omething again&s;t him. One of the que&s;tions they put was, Whether it was lawful to <HI>give Tribute to Cae&s;ar</HI> or not? In which Chri&s;t &s;aw thro' all their hypocri&s;y &amp; cunning: and gave them an an&s;wer, which rai&s;ed their admiration; but gave them no handle again&s;t him. &mdash; Then came the
<PB N="2" REF="009326_0005_1030EE07972D74D8">Sadducees with their puzzling que&s;tion <HI>about the Re&s;ur|rection:</HI> To which Chri&s;t an&s;wered, &s;o as not only to put them to &s;ilence, but to convince them of their error, and their infidelity, if they had not been prejudiced again&s;t him.</P>
<P>And now, one of the Scribes (the per&s;on our text re|fers to) being pre&s;ent; and hearing how well, and how wi&s;ely Chri&s;t an&s;wered the Phari&s;ees and the Sadducees; takes his turn and puts his que&s;tion, &s;aying to him; <HI>Which is the fir&s;t Commandment of all?</HI> The que&s;tion being put in a plain manner, and as if he aimed rather at being in&s;tructed, than to get any thing again&s;t Chri&s;t in his an&s;wer; Chri&s;t an&s;wers him directly to the que&s;tion; and tells him, that to <HI>love the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our &s;oul, and with all our &s;trength, was the fir&s;t Commandment;</HI> and goes fur|ther than the &s;cribe's que&s;tion, and tells him, which was the &s;econd, as well as the fir&s;t Commandment, namely <HI>to love his neighbour as him&s;elf:</HI> and a&s;&s;ures him, that there is <HI>no other Commandment greater than the&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The Scribe fell fully in with our Saviour's an&s;wer, and freely acknowledges it, and de&s;cants upon it, &s;aying, <HI>well Ma&s;ter thou ha&s;t &s;aid the truth;</HI> and going over the two commandments, he declares them to be his own principles, &s;aying, <HI>There is one God, and there is none other but he, and to love him with all the under&s;tanding, and with all the &s;oul, and with all the &s;trength, and to love his neigh|bour as him&s;elf, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices.</HI> There was &s;o much wi&s;dom and truth, as well as freedom, openne&s;s &amp; hone&s;tly appearing in this an&s;|wer, that Chri&s;t commends it, and commends him for it: <HI>for when Je&s;us &s;aw that he an&s;wered di&s;creetly, he &s;aid unto him, thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>What I propo&s;e is to &s;earch into the meaning of the text; and &s;ee what there was in this man, this &s;cribe, be|yond what there was in the other &s;cribes, or phari&s;ees, that &s;hould induce Chri&s;t to &s;ay of him, that <HI>he was not far from the kingdom of God:</HI> whereas the others were &s;o
<PB N="3" REF="009326_0006_1030EE092FBCA078">far from it, that he tells them <HI>Publicans &amp; Harlots would go into the Kingdom of God before them.</HI> Matth. 21.31. When Chri&s;t declared &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hingly of this &s;cribe a|bove the re&s;t, it does not appear to be by vertue of his om|ni&s;ciency, and power to &s;earch the heart; but he pronoun|ces thus upon him, from the di&s;covery he made of him&s;elf in his an&s;wer. And when Je&s;us &s;aw that <HI>he an&s;wered di&s;creetly,</HI> he &s;aid, thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>To handle this &s;ubject in as di&s;tinct and clear a manner as I can &mdash; I propo&s;e</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Briefly to &s;how what we are to under&s;tand by the Kingdom of God, which the &s;cribe was not far from.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To con&s;ider the <HI>&s;cribe's an&s;wer,</HI> and the &s;everal things which are contained therein, and &s;ee what there is in the <HI>an&s;wer,</HI> that bids fair for the <HI>kingdom of God,</HI> or &s;hewed that he was not far from it.</P>
<P>And as I go along, I &s;hall make &s;uch application of the &s;everal points, as may be in&s;tructive and profitable to us.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us con&s;ider the phra&s;e here <HI>the Kingdom of God;</HI> and what is to be under&s;tood by it.</P>
<P>Now it undoubtedly intends the <HI>go&s;pel kingdom,</HI> or the kingdom of grace, as it is exhibited and di&s;played in the go&s;pel, which di&s;pen&s;ation of grace began to be &s;et up in our Saviour's time.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we find John the Bapti&s;t and forerunner of Chri&s;t, preaching up repentance, &s;aying <HI>Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,</HI> Matth. iii. 2. And Chri&s;t him&s;elf began his publick mini&s;try declaring the &s;ame thing, <HI>Matth.</HI> iv. 7. The kingdom of heaven is the &s;ame with the kingdom of God, and promi&s;cuou&s;ly u&s;ed in the new te&s;tament.</P>
<P>This kingdom of God is that di&s;pen&s;ation which opens the grand my&s;tery of man's redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the cleare&s;t and fulle&s;t manner, that mankind has ever been &s;avoured with. A di&s;pen&s;ation that &s;ets forth the &s;in and ruin of man, and his recovery by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It &s;ets forth and declares all the world guilty before God; and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners;
<PB N="4" REF="009326_0007_1030EE0C954F3340">and that by his obedience and death he is become the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth. The kingdom of God, or go&s;pel kingdom, exhibits Chri&s;t to us, as the prophet, prie&s;t and king of our &s;alvation; and i&s;&s;ues forth this proclamation of grace in his name, He that <HI>believeth,</HI> that is on the Son of God, <HI>and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. xvi. 16. giving out many encouraging calls and endearing invitations, &s;etting forth the richne&s;s and freene&s;s of divine grace; and that the whole kingdom from the foundation to the top-&s;tone is of grace; that <HI>by grace we are &s;aved thro' faith, and that not of our &s;elves, it is the gift of God; not of works le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t,</HI> Eph. ii. 8.9. For this go&s;pel kingdom is a kingdom in which all boa&s;ting is forever excluded as to our &s;elves, both as to &s;trength as well as righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The kingdom of God is begun in this world. Every profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tian is a vi&s;ible member of this kingdom: every true chri&s;tian is a real member or &s;ubject of this king|dom: and as to &s;uch true believers in Chri&s;t,&mdash;the kingdom of grace is carried on in this world, and perfected in hea|ven; where there will be the completion, or perfection of the kingdom of grace in glory.</P>
<P>So then, from what has been &s;aid it appears, that the coming into this kingdom of God, is the becoming true chri&s;tians; and the actual coming into this kingdom or be|coming true chri&s;tians, comprehends in it; fir&s;t of all, a very deep &s;en&s;e of our lo&s;t and wretched &s;tate by rea&s;on of &s;in; and of our own utter inability to help or &s;ave our &s;elves: and &s;o of the ab&s;olute need we &s;tand in of a Sa|viour, and <HI>that a great one.</HI> It al&s;o comprehends in it a &s;incere belief that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the only, and the all-&s;ufficient Saviour, able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all who come to God by him; and that we actually receive him, as he is revealed and offered to us in his go&s;pel, and from a grateful &s;en&s;e of his infinite love and grace as well as of his authority and power, freely yield our &s;elves to his honour and &s;ervice, to glorify him in our bodies and with our &s;pirits which are his; living as his grace teaches us; running the race that is &s;et before us, all the while
<PB N="5" REF="009326_0008_1030EE0E71FEBC90">looking to Je&s;us as the author and fini&s;her of our faith; and as the grand medium of intercour&s;e between God and us, and by whom all &s;piritual and &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings are conveyed to us.</P>
<P>Every one who has come to &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of things, to &s;uch a faith in Chri&s;t, and &s;ubjection to him, is actually born, brought into this kingdom of God, and is a true Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Let us now con&s;ider the Scribe's an&s;wer, and &s;ee what there was in it; which di&s;covered that he was not far from the kingdom of God:</HI> And that he was nearer to it than the other Scribes Phari&s;ees, and Sadducees, or the Jews in general.</P>
<P>For the opening and illu&s;trating this Point;</P>
<P N="1">1. I would ob&s;erve that the <HI>Jewi&s;h nation had many things peculiar to them, that might &s;erve to prepare them for the go&s;pel kingdom, and &s;o it might be rea&s;onably ex|pected that they would not be far from the kingdom of God; but ready to enter into it, whenever it &s;hould come among them.</HI></P>
<P>No people had advantages equal with the Jews for un|der&s;tanding the nature of the go&s;pel kingdom: and &s;uch encouragements to come into it, as they had at fir&s;t; for really the kingdom of God, under a different di&s;pen&s;a|tion, had been among them from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his time. They had the advantage much every way; chiefly that unto them <HI>were committed the oracles of God:</HI> for in tho&s;e &s;acred oracles, they were taught the fall of our fir&s;t pa|rents, and how &s;in and ruin fir&s;t came into the world. And the old te&s;tament, as it taught them the &s;infulne&s;s of man, &s;o it taught them the need of a Saviour, and gave them the promi&s;e of one, even of the <HI>&s;eed of the woman;</HI> and a multitude of promi&s;es, con&s;equent upon this, and to open and inlighten the &s;ame unto them. By the old te&s;tament it was revealed to them, that this Saviour, the &s;eed of the woman, &s;hould be the &s;eed of <HI>Abraham</HI> their ance&s;tor, of the tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and of the lineage of
<PB N="6" REF="009326_0009_1030EE133AB90908"><HI>David</HI> that he &s;hould be born of a virgin, &amp; in <HI>Bethlehem</HI> of <HI>Judea.</HI> Moreover, it was foretold in their prophecies, that he &s;hould appear in a &s;tate of humiliation, &s;o as to be de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men, a man of &s;orrows and ac|quainted with grief; yea, that he &s;hould be wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, that he &s;hould pour out his &s;oul unto death, bear the &s;ins of many, and make interce&s;&s;ion for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors: and then &s;hould pa&s;s from that &s;tate of hu|miliation, to a &s;tate of exaltation &amp; glory; when he &s;hould &s;ee his &s;eed, and his kingdom &s;hould enlarge in the world, and he &s;hould be a light to the gentiles, as well as the glory of his people I&s;rael. Nay, the prophecies of the old te&s;tament went &s;o far, as to point out the very time when the great Saviour &s;hould appear and &s;et up his go&s;|pel kingdom, Dan. ix. 24. <HI>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to fini&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|on, to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s &amp;c.</HI> which prophecy was under|&s;tood of weeks of years, viz. 400 years, which brought it to the time that our Lord Je&s;us actually appeared: and accordingly, there was a general expectation of the Me&s;&s;iah in tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>And now one would think that a nation and people fa|voured with a multitude of &s;uch promi&s;es as the&s;e, and brought up from generation to generation in the belief of the Me&s;&s;iah to come, &s;hould be the neare&s;t to the kingdom, and the mo&s;t ready of any people in the world to enter in|to the go&s;pel kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, &s;o &s;oon as ever it came among them, and was publi&s;hed to them: which was done to them, before it was to any other people: for he was &s;ent in the fir&s;t place to the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, when we con&s;ider what the apo&s;tle &s;ays con|cerning them, Rom. ix. 4.5. <HI>That to them pertained the adoption and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving the law, and the &s;ervice of God, and the promi&s;es; and of whom as concerning the fle&s;h Chri&s;t came, who is over all God ble&s;&s;ed for ever;</HI> I &s;ay, con&s;idering the&s;e things, what could be thought, but that upon the news of the
<PB N="7" REF="009326_0010_1030EE17A1554B70">Me&s;&s;iah, and &s;etting up of his kingdom, the Jews from all quarters would flock in unto him?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Notwith&s;tanding the Jews had &s;uch advantages of being near the kingdom of God, and of entering into it; yet by rea&s;on of their horrible corruption, pride and per|ver&s;e con&s;truction of things; perhaps no people as &s;uch were farther from the kingdom than they.</HI></P>
<P>That nation abu&s;ed the &s;pecial favours of God to them; and grew very corrupt and wicked, proud and perver&s;e: and &s;o put proud and perver&s;e, corrupt and carnal inter|pretations upon the law, and upon the promi&s;es and pro|phecies concerning the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom. For they &s;eem'd to forget all that was predicted concerning his &s;uf|ferings, and making his &s;oul an offering for &s;in: and look|ed only for a Me&s;&s;iah, who &s;hould &s;et up his kingdom with external power and pomp; giving them (the Jews) the preheminence &amp; dominion over all other nations&mdash;More|over, by a perver&s;e, corrupt con&s;truction of the law, un|der&s;tanding and con&s;truing it as forbidding <HI>only</HI> the exter|nal and gro&s;s acts: they, e&s;pecially the &s;cribes and pha|ri&s;ees, grew very &s;elf-righteous, &s;o as not to &s;ee the need of a &s;uffering, and an atoning Saviour: nor did they &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration, or change of heart, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to our entering into the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>So that when the Me&s;&s;iah actually came, and the king|dom of God was among them; it was &s;o different from their carnal apprehen&s;ions, and vain proud thoughts relating to the kingdom, that they were prejudiced again&s;t it. They could not bear to have him who profe&s;&s;ed to be the Me&s;&s;iah, make &s;uch a poor outward appearance; and to take a number of poor illiterate fi&s;hermen for his di&s;ciples, and the chief mini&s;ters of his kingdom, rather than the great men, the learned Rabbies of their own nation: and his expounding the law in &s;uch an exten&s;ive &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, beyond what they did; and his reproving them &s;o plainly for their pride, hyprocri&s;y and wickedne&s;s, &s;et them again&s;t him, his per&s;on, his doctrine and his kingdom; &s;o as to pour the greate&s;t contempt upon the &s;ame; endeavoring <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="8" REF="009326_0011_1030EE1CBB615AE0">methods to &s;uppre&s;s his preten&s;ions to the Me&s;&s;iah-&s;hip, yea to kill him, and get him out of the way.</P>
<P>And thus that people who had the advantage of being neare&s;t the kingdom of God, were really further from it, in their temper and di&s;po&s;ition perhaps, than any people in the world. And agreably to this &s;ays our Saviour, Matth. viii. 11.12. <HI>Many &s;hall come from the ea&s;t and we&s;t, and &s;it down with Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob in the King|dom of heaven: but the children of the kingdom</HI> (that is the Jews) <HI>&s;hall be ca&s;t out.</HI> And again Matth. xxi. 31. <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you, that publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</HI> The pride and &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit of the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, their gro&s;s con|&s;truction of the law, their hypocri&s;y, their prejudice again&s;t the per&s;on of Chri&s;t, were &s;uch that even publicans and harlots were nearer the kingdom of God, more ready to receive the go&s;pel than they. And he who con&s;iders the nature of &s;piritual pride, &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, corrupt noti|ons in religion handed down to po&s;terity, together with ob|&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s of &s;pirit, mu&s;t needs &s;ee that they are qualities which &s;et us at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the kingdom of God: and that publicans &amp; harlots, and &s;uch &s;inners, who are con&s;cious of their evil ways, &s;eem to be more ea&s;ily convinced and per&s;waded, than &s;uch &s;ort of people.</P>
<P>But the &s;cribe in my text differed from his brethren; and how far &s;o ever they were from the kingdom of God, yet he was not far from it, as Chri&s;t the true&s;t and be&s;t judge in the matter, a&s;&s;erts and declares.</P>
<P>And &s;o I am brought to con&s;ider, what there was in this &s;cribe's an&s;wer, which &s;hew'd he was not far from the kingdom of God; or what there was in his an&s;wer, that di&s;covered he was in any &s;ort better prepared to embrace chri&s;tianity, and enter the go&s;pel kingdom than others.&mdash;</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t con&s;ider, the character which is given of his an&s;wer in general, viz. that he <HI>an&s;wered di&s;creetly.</HI> And then</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009326_0012_1030EE20B9235990">Secondly, con&s;ider the matter of the an&s;wer it &s;elf, and the &s;everal things contained therein; which may give us to &s;ee how near he was to the kingdom of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us con&s;ider the character which is given of his an&s;wer in general, viz. that he an&s;wered <HI>di&s;creetly,</HI> that is <HI>under&s;tandingly</HI> and <HI>wi&s;ely,</HI> as the word &s;ignifies.</P>
<P>He did not an&s;wer ignorantly, perver&s;ely, or &s;ophi&s;ti|cally. He did not an&s;wer with &s;ubtility and craft, as if he had any particular private de&s;ign of his own in view, or any point to gain, or any intangling &s;nare to guard again&s;t. He does not appear to an&s;wer with low cunning, and want of hone&s;ty, as the prie&s;ts and &s;cribes an&s;wered our Saviour, when he a&s;ked them, whether the <HI>bapti&s;m of John was from heaven, or of men? and they rea&s;oned with them|&s;elves, &s;aying; if we &s;hall &s;ay from heaven, he will then &s;ay, why believed ye him not? and if we &s;ay of men, all the people will &s;tone us, therefore they &s;aid, we cannot tell whence it was,</HI> Luk. xx. 4 &mdash; 7. They could have told at lea&s;t what they thought about the matter: but fearing le&s;t by an&s;wering either way, they &s;hould bring them&s;elves into a &s;nare; they evaded the matter, by &s;aying, they could not tell.&mdash; But there appears no &s;uch craftine&s;s or deceit in the an&s;wer of this &s;cribe; for he appears to an&s;|wer truly, yea hone&s;tly; and what he really thought to be the truth. His an&s;wer don't &s;eem to be the effect of pride, or pa&s;&s;ion, or fear, or bias to any particular party; nor does it &s;eem to &s;avour of prejudice or perver&s;ene&s;s: for his an&s;wer was a true and a good an&s;wer; and &s;uch an one as he ought to have given, exactly corre&s;ponding with what Chri&s;t him&s;elf had &s;aid in the foregoing ver&s;es. Moreover, it appears to be delivered with an air of hone&s;ty, and as his real opinion. This &s;cribe by the que&s;tion he a&s;ked at fir&s;t, and by this his reply to Chri&s;t's an&s;wer, &s;eems to have been an hone&s;t enquirer after truth; and was willing freely to own it, whenever it appeared to him. And upon this account he may be &s;aid to be not far; at lea&s;t not &s;o far from the kingdom of God as &s;ome others; but in a fairer way to embrace the chri&s;tian &s;cheme, than
<PB N="10" REF="009326_0013_1030EE225D21BBB0">his brethren. Who an&s;wered and acted with craft and de|&s;ign, under the influence of pride, ob&s;tinacy and hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>Thus a man having true thoughts, and a good under|&s;tanding, as to the doctrines, principles and precepts of chri&s;tianity, and a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;peak of the &s;ub&s;tantial points of religion, without any trimming or turning or equi|vocating, is not &s;o far from the kingdom of God; but is better prepared to receive the chri&s;tian faith, and come into the go&s;pel kingdom, than he who is ignorant, and errone|ous; who is proud and perver&s;e; in&s;incere and hypocri+tical, and who wilfully blinds his own eyes, and &s;uppre&s;&s;es the convictions of his own con&s;cience.</P>
<P>And now, who will deny but that there are men of &s;uch different characters, at le&s;t as to degrees? And &s;urely we may &s;ay, that the more knowing and under&s;tanding, the more free from guile and hypocri&s;y, and pride and preju|dice any are; they are nearer to the kingdom of God, than tho&s;e who have le&s;s knowledge, and more pride, pre|judice and hypocri&s;y.&mdash;I do not &s;ay, that the&s;e &s;hall be actually brought into the kingdom of God, or made true chri&s;tians before the others: for who may pre&s;ume to li|mit the power and grace of God, who can, if he plea&s;es, bring the remote&s;t from this kingdom, into it at once; and make the mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing wretches upon earth, the &s;ub|jects of his grace? But this no ways denies, but that the more under&s;tanding, and the more &s;ound in judgment, and the more free from pride and hypocri&s;y, they are not &s;o far from the kingdom of God as &s;ome others are.</P>
<P>Thus much concerning the an&s;wer in general, that it was a di&s;creet wi&s;e an&s;wer.&mdash; I now proceed,</P>
<P N="2">2. To con&s;ider <HI>the an&s;wer it &s;elf</HI> given by the &s;cribe, and &s;ee what there is in it, which gave occa&s;ion for Chri&s;t to &s;ay to him, that he was <HI>not far from the kingdom of God;</HI> but rather bid fair for becoming a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. The an&s;wer acknowledges and declares, that which is the fundamental principle of all true religion, viz. <HI>The being of a God, and the unity of the God-head.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="009326_0014_1030EE23F3F4E358">And the &s;cribe &s;aid unto him, <HI>Well ma&s;ter, thou ha&s;t &s;aid the truth: for there is one God, and none other but he;</HI> as in the ver&s;e but one before my text. Here you &s;ee, he believed there is a God: and this is the foundation of all religion; for religion and every act thereof &s;uppo|&s;es the being of a God: <HI>for he that cometh to God, mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently &s;eez him,</HI> Heb. xi. 6. Now, in this point he was not &s;o far from the kingdom of God, as tho&s;e <HI>athe|i&s;tical fools</HI> who &s;ay in their hearts, <HI>there is no God.</HI> There was not &s;o much to do to bring him into the king|dom of God, as there would be to &s;uch an one who does not &s;o much as believe there is a God: for the athei&s;t mu&s;t be brought to the faith of that which the &s;cribe believed already. So that he who believes there is a God, is at lea&s;t one &s;tep nearer to the kingdom of God, than he who don't &s;o much as believe there is a God, or any kingdom of God.</P>
<P>But then, the &s;cribe not only believed there was a God, but that there was only one God. There is <HI>one God</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>and none other but he.</HI> The faith he profe&s;&s;ed was that there was but one only living &amp; true God. Well, this is a &s;tep nearer than tho&s;e who multiply gods, and &s;o the objects of their wor&s;hip, and pay religious &s;ervice to a number of feigned deities, which is due only to the one true &amp; living God. Accordingly in this re&s;pect the &s;cribe might be &s;aid, not to be &s;o far from the kingdom of God, as the heathen world at that day, who had a multitude of gods, to whom they paid religious wor&s;hip: &s;uch as the &s;un, and moon, four-footed bea&s;ts, and creeping things, and graven images. For before the&s;e can come into the kingdom of God, they mu&s;t be turned from all the&s;e dumb idols; mu&s;t be con|vinced of the &s;in and folly of idolatry, and mu&s;t renounce it, which the &s;cribe implicitly does in his an&s;wer: and &s;o was nearer than tho&s;e who were &s;wallowed up in ignorance and idolatry.</P>
<P>And thus, &s;uch who have right notions of the Godhead as to the unity thereof; and &s;o of the one only object of re|ligious wor&s;hip, are nearer the kingdom of God, than &s;uch
<PB N="12" REF="009326_0015_1030EE27A72EA7A8">who multiply objects of religious wor&s;hip, and divide the glory due only to God, with &s;ome of his creatures: as &s;uch who wor&s;hip the virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and pray to Angels, and &s;aints departed, as if they heard and knew, and were able to help and &s;ave. The divine precept is, <HI>Thou &s;halt wor|&s;hip the Lord thy God, and him only &s;halt thou &s;erve,</HI> Matth. iv. 10. Accordingly, &s;uch who embrace the pro|te&s;tant principles, which renounce all idolatry, are in that re&s;pect nearer the kingdom of God, than tho&s;e who em|brace the idolatrous principles of the church of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. His an&s;wer made a proper <HI>di&s;tinction between the moral and the ceremonial law; and acknowledges the mo|ral to be much preferable, to all the ceremonies and mo&s;t co&s;tly &s;acrifices under the mo&s;aic oeconomy.</HI></P>
<P>For thus the &s;cribe an&s;wers: and <HI>to love him with all the heart &amp;c. and to love his neighbour as him&s;elf, is more than all whole burnt offerings &amp; &s;acrifices.</HI> As in the v. before my text. To love God with all the heart &amp; &s;oul; and our neighbour as our &s;elves; is the &s;um and &s;ub|&s;tance of the moral law: and this he freely acknowledges to be more than all whole burnt offerings, and &s;acrifices, which may be con&s;idered as the &s;um of the ceremonial law, or of po&s;itive in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>It was a matter of no &s;mall di&s;pute among the Jews, which was the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> commandment. Some pleaded for <HI>circumci&s;ion;</HI> which precept was given to their father <HI>Abraham</HI> as a &s;eal of the covenant. Others pleaded for the <HI>philacteries,</HI> which were certain portions of the law, written of &s;trips of parchment, that they wore upon their foreheads and upon their arms; agreable to what is commanded, <HI>Exod.</HI> xiii. 9. <HI>Deut.</HI> v. 8, 11 &mdash; 18. Now the&s;e portions of the law being written and &s;et forth in &s;uch a con&s;picuous manner, were frequently repeated by tho&s;e who wore them. And our Saviour ob&s;erves of the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxiii. 5. <HI>that they made broad their philacteries,</HI> out of o&s;tentation and &s;how: and no wonder if they pleaded for the precepts in&s;cribed on their philacte|ries as the greate&s;t commandments; among which was the
<PB N="13" REF="009326_0016_1030EE2E5E23A708">law of the pa&s;&s;over; the &s;anctifying the fir&s;t-born of men; and &s;etting apart of fir&s;tlings of bea&s;ts, <HI>Exod.</HI> xiii. <HI>begin</HI> Others pleaded for the <HI>law of &s;acrifices, purification</HI> and <HI>keeping fe&s;tivals.</HI></P>
<P>But now, this &s;cribe &s;eems to under&s;tand the difference between moral precepts and meerly po&s;itive in&s;titutions; and gives the preference to the precepts of morality: To love God with all the heart, and our neighbour as our &s;elf, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices. The language of the jewi&s;h practice was, as if burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices were the great commandment; For the&s;e, they were ob&s;ervant of, and had great dependance upon, and upon occa&s;ion would abound in them, even while they neglected the love of God, and of their neighbour. Nay our Saviour ob&s;erves concerning them, that they were &s;o critical and nice, as to tythe their <HI>mint, anni&s;e</HI> and <HI>cum|min,</HI> and &s;uch like herbs; when at the &s;ame time they neglected the weightier matters of the law, <HI>judgment, mer|cy, faith,</HI> and the <HI>love of God,</HI> Matth. xxiii. 23. Luk. xi. 42.</P>
<P>But this &s;cribe under&s;tood the nature of true religion, and wherein it con&s;i&s;ts better than this came to. He freely and fully gave the preference to the moral law; and al|lows that the love of God, and of our neighbour, are greater commandments, and of greater importance reli|gion, than all the &s;acrifices, and ceremonies of the jewi&s;h law. In this re&s;pect he was orthodox and &s;ound in his prin|ciples; and judged truly in the ca&s;e; for the oracles of truth teach us, that God hath not &s;uch delight in burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord; and that to obey, e&s;pecially this great commandment of love, is better than &s;acrifice; and to hearken than the fat of rams, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xv. 22. And to do ju&s;tice and judgment (which implies love to our neighbour,) is more acceptable to the Lord than &s;acrifice, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxi. 3.</P>
<P>Now who can &s;ay this &s;cribe was &s;o far from the king|dom of God, as tho&s;e who had very different and &s;o very fal&s;e apprehen&s;ions of the&s;e things? and who placed their religion in circumci&s;ion, or the &s;acrifices and ceremonies of the jewi&s;h church, rather than in tho&s;e two great command|ments
<PB N="14" REF="009326_0017_1030EE300FCEDC18">of love to God and our neighbour? For the king|dom of God, or the go&s;pel kingdom, has laid a&s;ide all the &s;acrifices and ceremonies of the jewi&s;h law; and is a more plain and &s;imple di&s;pen&s;ation; the &s;ub&s;tantial parts of which are &s;upreme love to God, and Chri&s;t, and &s;incere fervent charity one to another: all excited by or grounded upon a true faith in Chri&s;t. Says the Apo&s;tle, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 5. The end of the commandment, that is the completion, or perfection of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, is LOVE, out of a pure heart, and a good con&s;cience, and faith unfeigned.&mdash; Surely then, this &s;cribe, who at lea&s;t maintained this in theory, was not &s;o far from the kingdom, as tho&s;e who placed their religion in &s;acrifices, purifications, and the punctilio's of the mo&s;aic law, or of their oral traditions: for this error in their under&s;tanding and judgment, mu&s;t be corrected &amp; rectified; before they would be even with him re&s;pecting the go&s;pel kingdom.</P>
<P>And thus we may confidently a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch who do &s;o well under&s;tand religion, as to be able truly to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the weightier and le&s;&s;er matters of the go&s;pel; between the e&s;&s;entials, and circum&s;tantials of chri&s;tianity; are not &s;o far from this kingdom, as tho&s;e who gro&s;ly mi&s;take in this point; and place their religion more in the outward form and appearance, than in the truth and reality of it; and who lay more &s;tre&s;s upon the outward &s;ervices, and in&s;tituted parts of religion, than upon the moral part thereof. So that under the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation, &s;uch per&s;ons as place their religion in outward pro|fe&s;&s;ions and &s;ervices, and &s;atisfy them&s;elves with the morn|ing and evening &s;acrifices of prayer and prai&s;e, and with the public wor&s;hip, and religious &s;ervices of the &s;abbath, without &s;eeking after that faith in Chri&s;t, that love to God and their neighbour, which the go&s;pel requires, are not &s;o near the kingdom of God, as they who look upon faith, repentance, love and holine&s;s, to be the great things of religion: and who attend upon the po&s;itive in&s;tituted parts of religion, not as if the kingdom of God con&s;i&s;ted in them, but as means of God's appointing to attain tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tan|tial vertues and graces, in which the go&s;pel kingdom doth
<PB N="15" REF="009326_0018_1030EE319E1395C0">con&s;i&s;t. <HI>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and joy in the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Rom. xiv. 17.</P>
<P>Many people are apt to deceive them&s;elves, and think they are near the kingdom of heaven: yea, that they are actually in the kingdom of grace; becau&s;e they are con|&s;tant in attending religious wor&s;hip, &amp; go on in a round of duties; when perhaps they have little or no regard to the love of God or of their neighbour; but with all this round of religious duties, indulge them&s;elves in pride, worldli|ne&s;s, envy, hatred and malice. The&s;e, altho' they may be near in the eye of the world, as well as in their own conceit, yet are really far from the kingdom, and without a rectifying their under&s;tanding and judgment, as well as a change of their will and inclination, they will not &s;ee the kingdom of God, or become real chri&s;tians: whereas the man who is doctrinally knowing in this matter, and un|der&s;tands that faith and repentance, love and holine&s;s, are the great things of chri&s;tianity; and the po&s;itive precepts and in&s;tituted duties, are the appointed means to bring us to this, is not &s;uch an error as the former.</P>
<P>Indeed, we are not to make the di&s;tinction &s;o wide between the in&s;tituted means of grace, and the grace it &s;elf, as to neglect the means, under a pretence that we are looking after the end, the &s;ub&s;tantial parts of religion: for he who overlooks and neglects the in&s;tituted means, &s;uch as prayer, the word and ordinances, has not really a proper regard for the &s;ub&s;tantial parts of religion as the end: for the go&s;pel not only requires faith, love and holine&s;s, as the great things of the kingdom: but it requires our diligent &amp; con|&s;tant attendance on the po&s;itive and in&s;tituted parts of reli|gion, &s;uch as reading, hearing, praying, and walking in all the ordinances, which are appointed as means of obtaining grace; or of growth therein. For altho' the&s;e duties may not be re&s;ted in; yet they mu&s;t ob&s;erved by us. The weightier matters mu&s;t be above all regarded; but the out|ward forms of divine appointment may not be neglected.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="16" REF="009326_0019_1030EE3520956E40">3. <HI>The &s;cribe's an&s;wer was free from the common error and corruption of that day; as if it was only an external conformity that the law required: whereas he acknowleges that the commandment reached to the heart, and required the inward e&s;teem and affections of the &s;oul, as well as the outward expre&s;&s;ions of love.</HI></P>
<P>His an&s;wer is, and to love the Lord with the <HI>heart,</HI> and with the <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> and with the <HI>&s;oul,</HI> and with the <HI>&s;trength,</HI> and to love his neighbour as <HI>him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>The Jews at that day had &s;o corrupted the written word with their oral traditions, as to make religion to be a meer out&s;ide thing, a meer form, a carca&s;s without any life and &s;pirit to animate it: and as if the heart had no|thing or but little to do in the matter. For although the written word they then had, taught them that God looketh at the heart, and <HI>that he required truth in the inward parts.</HI> P&s;al. li. 5. yea and that God <HI>demanded the heart,</HI> Prov. xxiii. 26. yet by &s;ome means or other, they had &s;o perverted the&s;e and &s;uch like places of &s;cripture, as to bring their religion ve|ry much to the out&s;ide, &amp; as if the inner man had but little to do in their religious &s;ervices. And this appears from the ma|ny plain hints and reproofs which Chri&s;t gave them in this matter at one time and another; but more e&s;pecially in his &s;ermon upon the mount; one evident de&s;ign of which was to re&s;cue the law from the fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es, which the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees had put upon it; whereby they had taken away the &s;pirit of the law, and confin'd it to the gro&s;&s;er acts; and as if the heart and &s;pirit of the man was no way concerned with the law. Matth. v. 21. <HI>Ye have heard that it was &s;aid by them of old time, thou &s;halt not kill: and who&s;ever &s;hall kill, &s;hall be in danger of the judgment: but I &s;ay unto you, who&s;oever is ANGRY with his brother without a cau&s;e, &s;hall be in dan|ger of the judgment.</HI> By which it appeared that they con&s;trued the &s;ixth commandment, as forbidding only gro&s;s actual murder: and that if they did not actually kill a per&s;on, they did not break this commandment. But now our Saviour would have them to know, that this law reached their very &s;pirit; and that if they &s;uffered their &s;pirits to
<PB N="17" REF="009326_0020_1030EE3B9981E458">ri&s;e &s;o much as into anger without a cau&s;e, they tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ed this law. They little thought when they indulged cau&s;ele&s;s and ra&s;h anger, hatred, wrath, de&s;ire of revenge, that they brake this law.&mdash;So <HI>again, ye have heard, that it hath been &s;aid, thou &s;halt not commit adultery: but I &s;ay unto you, who&s;oever lacketh on a woman to lu&s;t after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</HI> chap. v. 27.28. By which it appears, as if the doctrine of that day was, that only the gro&s;s act of adultery was forbidden by that commandment. But here he corrects their error, and gives them to under&s;tand that the law was more &s;piri|tual, and exten&s;ive in it's requirements than this&punc; and that &s;o much as uncha&s;te thoughts and de&s;ires indulged, were breaches of this commandment: Furthermore, the <HI>wo</HI> that Chri&s;t pronounces upon them for <HI>making clean only the out&s;ide of the cup or platter,</HI> Matth. xxiii. 35. plainly &s;hews, that an out&s;ide religion was what they taught and practi&s;ed, without any proper regard to the Heart.</P>
<P>The Scribe &s;eems by his an&s;wer to under&s;tand that re|ligion was inward as well as outward; that to love God and his neighbour, was not to love in word and in tongue only, or in &s;ome outward expre&s;&s;ions of love: but to love with the heart, indeed and in truth. The Scribe's an&s;wer con&s;iders the heart and &s;oul as the &s;eat of this love: and that the commandment reached to the heart, and to all that is within him.</P>
<P>Now &s;uch a true apprehen&s;ion of religion, &s;hew'd, that he was not &s;o far from the kingdom of God as his brethren &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, who taught the law as reaching only to the outward man. His an&s;wer di&s;covers a true thought of religion, and that it lay in the heart, as well as in the outer man. And &s;urely this is a &s;tep, a large &s;tep towards true chri&s;tianity, nearer than tho&s;e who adhered to the meer lettter of the law, without any regard to the &s;pirit of the &s;ame. Con&s;ider how much further they mu&s;t needs be from true chri&s;tianity, who make religion all an out&s;ide thing; than he who in his principles &amp; profe&s;&s;ion extends it to the heart and &s;oul, and all the powers of the inner man.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="009326_0021_1030EE3D633A8630">From whence we may argue, that &s;uch who maintain this principle, that religion is &s;piritual, and reaches to all the powers and affections of the &s;oul, as well as to the or|gans and members of the body, are not &s;o far from the kingdom of God, as &s;uch who place all their religion in the out&s;ide and bodily part. Varying the terms, and putting chri&s;tian in&s;tead of jew; and chri&s;tianity in&s;tead of circum|ci&s;ion; we may adopt the words of the apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 28, 29. and &s;ay, <HI>He is not a chri&s;tian, who is one out|wardly; But he is a chri&s;tian, who is one inwardly. &mdash; For chri&s;tianity is that of the heart, in the &s;pirit, not in the letter, who&s;e prai&s;e is not of men but of God.</HI></P>
<P>Here then, we may &s;ee that they who place religion in the heart and &s;pirit, as well as outer man; are much nearer the kingdom of God, than &s;uch who place all their religi|on in outward forms and modes of wor&s;hip, and in exter|nal expre&s;&s;ions of love and regard to God, without any no|tice of their hearts, to &s;ee that they be right with him. What a poor religion mu&s;t that be, that is only in the letter, but not in the &s;pirit? and how remote mu&s;t they be from true chri&s;tianity, who place it all in &s;ome outward form, and appearance, and look no further? whereas the man who in his judgment, places religion in the heart, even al|tho' he has not attained to this inward gracious principle him&s;elf; yet appears to be in a much fairer way for it than the former. For by con&s;idering the law of God in its large extent, as reaching to the heart, the thoughts, de&s;ires and intents of it, as well as to the outward man, the man is in a much fairer way to conviction, which is a &s;tep to repentance: for whil&s;t the man con&s;iders the law as reach|ing to his heart, he is led to &s;ee innumerable &s;ins in his heart which the other is in&s;en&s;ible of. And &s;uch an one cannot but &s;ee a deal of corruption and wickedne&s;s wtihin, which the other thinks nothing of; &s;o that this man who &s;ees the law reaching his heart, is one &s;tep nearer to conviction than the other. The apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> when phari&s;ee, and &s;erv|ing the law in the oldne&s;s of the letter, without extending it to the inner man, was blamele&s;s and righteous in his own eyes: but when he &s;aw the &s;pirituality of the law; and
<PB N="19" REF="009326_0022_1030EE3EF1B44610">how it's precepts reached to the heart, and all the inner man; then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> revived, then he had a &s;en&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> which he never had before. But without &s;uppo&s;ing the eyes to be opened to &s;uch a degree, and in &s;uch a &s;piritual and &s;aving manner, by the &s;pirit of God, as the apo&s;tle's were: it may be truly &s;aid, that a &s;peculative apprehen&s;ion of the exten&s;ivene&s;s of the divine law, reaching to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, de&s;ires and purpo&s;es of the heart, lays a man much more fairly open to conviction, than he who is in&s;en&s;ible of this; and has no apprehen&s;ion of either the &s;ins or duties of the heart.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Scribe's an&s;wer &s;how'd, that he under&s;tood LOVE to be the grand, and even univer&s;al principle of all true religion.</HI></P>
<P>Says he, to LOVE God with the heart, under&s;tanding, &s;trength and &s;oul; and to LOVE his neighbour as him&s;elf, is more than all burnt-offerings, and &s;acrifices. So that he by his an&s;wer under&s;tood LOVE, the love of God e&s;pecially that was the main thing in religion and the grand &s;pring or principle, from whence any religious &s;ervices are performed in an acceptable manner. His an&s;wer plainly intimates, that there is nothing in religion equal with <HI>Love.</HI> The an&s;|wer fully falls in with what Chri&s;t had ju&s;t before &s;aid, that the fir&s;t commandment was to love the Lord with all thine heart &amp;c. this is the fir&s;t commandment: it is the great commandment of all; it is the life and &s;oul and &s;a|vour of every thing el&s;e in religion, without the love of God re&s;ting in the heart, all acts of religion are but dead formality.</P>
<P>And now, as the &s;cribe by his an&s;wer &s;eems to under|&s;tand this; he was advanced a con&s;iderable &s;tep towards the kingdom of God, to what others were, who placed the e&s;&s;ence of religion in any thing be&s;ides <HI>Love:</HI> even altho' they &s;hould place it in the mo&s;t difficult and mo&s;t &s;elf-de|nying acts of obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God. Some are apt to place religion in a fear and dread of the divine ma|je&s;ty, and in a &s;ort of &s;ervile obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will, in voluntary humility, in mortifications and &s;elf-denials, without con&s;idering <HI>that love</HI> which is the nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="20" REF="009326_0023_1030EE408401B9F0">ingredient and e&s;&s;ential principle of every thing in religion; they labour under gro&s;s mi&s;takes in religion, for thus &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>Though I have the gift of prophecy and un|der&s;tand all my&s;teries, and all knowledge; and though I had all faith, &s;o that I could remove mountains: and though I be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> my goods to feed the poor; and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity,</HI> or love <HI>I am nothing, and it all profiteth me nothing.</HI> 1 Cor. xiii. 23. Religion without love is bondage and &s;lavery ra|ther than glorious liberty; and would be a meer ta&s;k and burden, rather than delightful to the &s;oul. It is <HI>love</HI> which renders the ways of religion, ways of plea&s;antne&s;s; and more delightful than all riches, or indeed than nece&s;|&s;ary food.</P>
<P>And therefore when men's &s;entiments are &s;o rectified (as they were in &s;ome degree in this &s;cribe) as to &s;ee love to be the &s;oul of religion; and the very thing that gives us plea&s;ure in religion, &amp; renders the &s;ame thro' Chri&s;t ac|ceptable to the great object of religion, they are not far from the kingdom of God. For love is the cardinal grace in the chri&s;tian &s;cheme. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 13. <HI>Now abideth faith, hope and love; but the greate&s;t of there is love:</HI> our bi|ble renders it <HI>charity,</HI> but the word is <HI>love;</HI> &s;o in the forementioned 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 5. The <HI>end of the commandment,</HI> or the perfection of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation <HI>is love,</HI> out of a pure heart, a good con&s;cience, and faith unfeigned.</P>
<P>Indeed, faith &s;eems to &s;tand fir&s;t in the go&s;pel &s;cheme; hence this was the go&s;pel that the apo&s;tles were &s;ent forth to preach every where: <HI>He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, Mark</HI> xvi. 10. and we are &s;aid, <HI>to be &s;aved by grace, through faith; Eph.</HI> ii. 8. But then that faith which is &s;aving worketh, or is made perfect by love. It is love that animates the faith, and makes it a living &s;aving faith, without which it is a dead faith, and will profit nothing.</P>
<P>So that if you would but &s;o much as get near the king|dom of God, you mu&s;t get well po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this one point, that <HI>love</HI> is of the very e&s;&s;ence of chri&s;tianity, the very life and &s;oul of it, without which no religion can be plea&s;ing to God, or plea&s;ant or profitable to our &s;elves.
<PB N="21" REF="009326_0024_1030EE474072FD80">For altho' <HI>faith</HI> be the ba&s;is of all true religion, becau&s;e he that cometh unto God, mu&s;t believe that he is; and &s;o he who cometh to Chri&s;t, and becomes a &s;ubject of his kingdom, mu&s;t believe that he is the Son of the living God, and the Saviour of &s;inners: yet if a man &s;hould pre|tend that barely &s;uch a faith is the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of true chri&s;tianity, and that &s;uch a faith is of it &s;elf and by it &s;elf a &s;aving faith, they &s;et up a dead faith for a &s;aving faith, and &s;et up that for &s;aving religion, that has neither &s;pirit, nor favour, nor reli&s;h in it. For <HI>love</HI> &s;eems to be a fulfilling of the go&s;pel, as well as of the law. So that there is no faith that will &s;ave without love; no fear, no hope, no repentance, no obedience, no acts of devotion that are to any &s;aving purpo&s;e without love. O then, may we be well po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this point in theory, and let us la|bour after &s;uch a &s;upreme love to God, and &s;uch a &s;uper|lative love to the Lord Je&s;us; and &s;uch a &s;incere fervent charity one to another, which is the very life and &s;oul of chri&s;tianity, and in which the kingdom of God con&s;i&s;ts. May God by his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit &s;hed abroad this love into our &s;ouls!</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;cribe's an&s;wer di&s;covered that he under&s;tood the commandment of the law required <HI>perfect love with|out any defect or falling &s;hort therein.</HI></P>
<P>It is, &s;ays the &s;cribe, to love him with <HI>all</HI> the heart, and with <HI>all</HI> the under&s;tanding, with <HI>all</HI> the &s;oul, and with <HI>all</HI> the &s;trength. So that here we &s;ee the &s;cribe acknowledg|ing that the commandment of the law requir'd perfect love, the love of the whole man to the utmo&s;t extent of human power, without the lea&s;t failing or falling &s;hort therein. There mu&s;t be no time, not &s;o much as one moment, but what God mu&s;t have the <HI>whole</HI> love of the <HI>whole</HI> heart and &s;oul, without the lea&s;t abatement: For the law don't al|low for the lea&s;t defect or failing.</P>
<P>But here you may be ready to a&s;k, how this <HI>&s;entiment</HI> concerning the law and commandment &s;erved to bring him nearer to the kingdom of God?</P>
<P>To which, I would an&s;wer and &s;ay, that con&s;idering this &s;entiment in the an&s;wer of the &s;cribe, with the plain,
<PB N="22" REF="009326_0025_1030EE4A69594BF0">obvious and natural con&s;equences of the &s;ame; per|haps there is no one &s;entiment in the &s;cribe's an&s;wer that led more directly to the kingdom of God, or kingdom of grace, than this.</P>
<P>For let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That this mu&s;t needs afford matter of conviction to him that he had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed this commandment, and was guilty before God. &mdash; For when he con&s;iders what he &s;ays, that the fir&s;t and great commandment is, to love the Lord our God, with <HI>all</HI> the heart, and with <HI>all</HI> the &s;oul, and with <HI>all</HI> the &s;trength, and his neighbour as <HI>him&s;elf;</HI> he mu&s;t &s;ee if he look'd into him&s;elf, and back upon his pa&s;t life, that he had not come up to this commandment; but had fallen &s;hort of it in innumerable in&s;tances: and indeed that he never did in one in&s;tance come up to this commandment: that he did not then at that time; and that he never did love God with <HI>all</HI> his heart, and with <HI>all</HI> his &s;oul. Nay, if he would but examine him&s;elf with any tolerable care or impartiality, he would find that in|&s;tead of loving God with <HI>all</HI> his heart, he did not love him with any heartine&s;s or &s;incerity at all: but th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> in&s;tead thereof the world, and the things which are in the world, &s;uch as the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life, had gotten his heart, his under&s;tanding, his &s;oul, and all his &s;trength. And that in&s;tead of being devoted entirely to God, the world and &s;elf had engro&s;s'd his af|fections, his thoughts, his time, and all his care.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t that man think of him&s;elf and of his condi|tion; who allows that the fir&s;t and great commandment is to love the Lord his God with <HI>all</HI> his heart, &s;oul, &amp; &s;trength, and finds that he him&s;elf falls utterly &s;hort of it; &s;o as never in one in&s;tance in all his life to come up to this com|mandment? Would not his &s;hew the man that he is a &s;inner, a great &s;inner, who has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed this great and good commandment, and never once in all his life com|plied with it? And how can he help thinking that God is infinitely angry at him, for denying to him that perfect &s;upreme love which he demands, and which is infinitely
<PB N="23" REF="009326_0026_1030EE4C0103CFB8">due to him: and giving his heart and affections to &s;ome inferior creature or other? And how can he help think|ing that he is expo&s;ed to the divine re&s;entment, and lies open to the dreadful wrath, and almighty vengeance of that God from whom he has with-held that love and &s;ervice which he demanded, and is infinitely due to him? And when the man has gone on in &s;uch a natural train of thinking as this, what can remain to him, but a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation to devour him?</P>
<P>Now what &s;ituation of mind is nearer the kingdom of God than this? What temper of mind better prepared to hearken to the news of a Saviour, and of a way of &s;al|vation than this? So that the &s;cribe by acknowledging the fir&s;t and great commandment was to love God with a per|fect love, without any defect, might by looking into him|&s;elf &s;ee that he had broken, yea that he had never kept this commandment; and con&s;equently that he was liable to the wrath and cur&s;e of God, which is denounced again&s;t every one that continueth not in <HI>all</HI> things that are writ|ten in the book of the law to do them, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 10. And this mu&s;t needs &s;erve to prepare his mind better than any thing to hearken to the news of a Saviour, and to embrace a method of &s;alvation that &s;hould be propounded to him; which is the very <HI>kingdom of God,</HI> we are treating of. For if the &s;cribe did but let his thoughts run in a natural rational cour&s;e upon this commandment, they mu&s;t quickly run to this, that he needed one to help and &s;ave him, and that without a Saviour &amp; Redeemer, he mu&s;t needs peri&s;h. Well now, let the &s;cribe be brought to this point, which his own an&s;wer would by plain and &s;hort rea&s;oning lead him to: and how far would he then be (do you think) from the kingdom of God, which reveals &s;uch an atoning &s;acrifice, and &s;aviour unto him?</P>
<P>And from hence, we may ob&s;erve, that a due &s;en&s;e of the demands which the divine law has upon us; and the perfect love, the perfect holine&s;s, and un&s;inning obedience it requires of us, &s;erves to bring us near to the kingdom of God, as it is a preparation for our entertaining and em|bracing
<PB N="24" REF="009326_0027_1030EE4D91C45ED0">the gracious offers of the <HI>go&s;pel.</HI> In order to know what manner of per&s;ons we are, and what we &s;tand in need of, we mu&s;t know what we ought to be: And to know what we ought to be, is to know what the law of God which is righteous and holy, demands of us. And therein we &s;hall &s;ee it requires perfect LOVE, the love of the whole heart perfect obedience, and &s;potle&s;s holine&s;s. And now when we compare our &s;elves with this law, we &s;hall &s;ee &s;uch dreadful defects and deviations from it; yea a life and a temper &s;o contrary hereunto, as to &s;ee that if God &s;hould proceed again&s;t us, according to the rigorous but righteous demands of the law, we mu&s;t needs be undone and mi&s;e|rable to all eternity: And con&s;equently that we &s;tand in ab&s;olute need of one to interpo&s;e in our behalf, and help and &s;ave us from the wrath to come. And when is a man &s;o well prepared to receive a &s;aviour, as when he &s;ees the ab&s;olute need of one? Says Chri&s;t, Mat. ix. 12. <HI>The whole need not a phy&s;ician, but they that are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">: I came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance.</HI> Per|&s;ons mu&s;t &s;ee them&s;elves to be <HI>&s;inners,</HI> before they will &s;ee any occa&s;ion for repentance, or need of a &s;aviour: And in order to &s;ee them&s;elves &s;inners, they mu&s;t &s;ee the law in the wide extent thereof. You therefore who are in|&s;en&s;ible of your &s;ins and don't &s;ee &s;uch need of an atoning &s;acrifice, and &s;aviour; do but look to the law of God, and &s;ee what perfect love, and perfect holine&s;s it requires of you; and what a cur&s;e it denounces again&s;t all who tran&s;gre&s;s the &s;ame. And &s;ee how horribly you fall &s;hort, and tran&s;gre&s;s this law; and how you thereby expo&s;e your &s;elves to the divine wrath and cur&s;e: And then you will &s;ee the need of one to atone for your &s;ins, to interceed be|tween you and the divine wrath; and to be the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s unto you. And when you &s;hall be brought to &s;uch a &s;tate as this, there will be but a &s;tep be|tween you and the kingdom of God: But a &s;tep between you and your acceptance of Chri&s;t, who is in go&s;pel revealed, and offered to you as &s;uch a &s;aviour.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="25" REF="009326_0028_1030EE4F20FA0058">2. But then, it is to be con&s;idered further that the &s;cribe if he under&s;tood his own an&s;wer, mu&s;t needs &s;ee, that as he had not kept the law for the time pa&s;t; &s;o neither could he for the time to come; and that if God &s;hould forgive all his pa&s;t offences again&s;t the fir&s;t and great command|ment yet that he could not keep it for the time to come; but &s;hould be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing it every day, and be adding to the new &s;core of guilt continually; nay he mu&s;t needs &s;ee, if he thoroughly examined and ob&s;erved him&s;elf, that he was &s;o far from being able to love and &s;erve God perfectly, that he was not able to do it with any go&s;pel &s;incerity, without &s;ome &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And this would bring him a &s;tep nearer to the kingdom of God, as it would lead him to &s;ee not only that he needed an atoning &s;acrifice for &s;ins pa&s;t, but &s;ome &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to enable him to love God even with &s;incerity. And as Chri&s;t is offered in the go&s;|pel kingdom, to be our <HI>&s;trength,</HI> as well as <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> it would &s;erve to prepare the way for his acceptance of him in that character al&s;o. Surely the &s;cribe, if his heart was in his own an&s;wer, mu&s;t &s;ee it was highly rea&s;onable to love God above all: But then he might doubtle&s;s &s;ee that he could not &s;o much as do this, without the divine help: That he had not &s;o much the command of his own heart and affections, as to fix them &s;upremely upon him, whom his rea&s;on and con&s;cience told him was the proper object hereof. And the more he &s;aw of this his weakne&s;s and impotency to guide and govern his affections and appe|tites, the nearer he was to the kingdom of God; as by this he would be the better di&s;po&s;ed to accept of the help which Chri&s;t offers in his go&s;pel, and of his grace that would be &s;ufficient for him.</P>
<P>Accordingly we may ob&s;erve that a &s;en&s;e of the divine precepts, and the va&s;t extent of them, together with a &s;en&s;e of our own inability of our &s;elves to keep them &s;o much as with any go&s;pel &s;incerity, prepares for the go&s;pel kingdom, and brings us near to it, where grace and help is offered, and may be had. The more we &s;ee of the perfections of the divine law, the more we &s;hall &s;ee of our own imperfecti|on and weakne&s;s; and the more we &s;ee of our own weak|ne&s;s

<P>Thus particularly according to the &s;cribe's an&s;wer, when a man &s;ees the command is to love the Lord our God with all our heart, &amp;c. and when <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> but ac|knowledge that it is highly ju&s;t &amp; rea&s;onable that he &s;hould thus love God; but finds he has <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;trength and pow|er of his own to do it; but that his heart <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">iving upon God, runs after the world &amp; the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> not de&s;ire grace to help him to take off his affection from the world, and fix them upon God? <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> be in|clined, or at lea&s;t will he not &s;ee it rea&s;onable that he &s;hould be inclined to come into that go&s;pel kingdom where help and grace may be had; where the love of God may be &s;o &s;hed abroad in his heart by the holy Gho&s;t, whereby he may be enabled to love God &s;incerely and &s;upremely, although not with a legal perfection.</P>
<P>Thus I have con&s;idered &s;everal things in the &s;cribe's an&s;wer; all which being laid together, gave occa&s;ion for our Saviour to &s;ay of him, that <HI>he was not far from the kingdom of God:</HI> that is, not far from &s;eeing into the rea|&s;onablene&s;s and truth of chri&s;tianity, and embracing the &s;ame. But whether he ever actually came into this king|dom, &s;o as to become a true di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t or not, we cannot &s;ay, becau&s;e we have no further account of him. But by his di&s;creet an&s;wer, and what was comprehended therein. Chri&s;t him&s;elf pronounces upon him, that he was not far from the kingdom of God, that is, according to the plain and natural &s;en&s;e of our Saviour's words, that he was nearer the go&s;pel kingdom; and bid <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to be a chri&s;tian than his brethren. And it mu&s;t be allowed this the principles and &s;entiments in his an&s;wer as I have &s;hewn, plainly &s;et forth, that if they were &s;eriou&s;ly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, and duly pro&s;ecuted, they would lead a man to &s;ee that he

&s;tood in need of a Saviour, &amp; of ju&s;t &s;uch a Saviour as Je&s;us Chri&s;t is. And then there would want only this one &s;tep actually to enter into the kingdom; namely the free own|ing, and hearty accepting of Chri&s;t for his prince &amp; &s;aviour, as he is revealed and offered in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude the &s;ubject with &s;ome APPLICATION.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>From what we have heard we infer that although &s;ome are not &s;o far from the kingdom of God as others; yet this is not always according to outward and human appearance; for oftentimes &s;ame who &s;eem the neare&s;t are really the furthe&s;t off.</HI></P>
<P>Our Saviour in the text a&s;&s;erts concerning one, that he was not far from the kingdom of God; which implies that others were far off, or were not &s;o near. And this doubtle&s;s is the ca&s;e in the &s;everal ages and places of the world, e&s;pecially in every part of the vi&s;ible church. For it mu&s;t be allowed, that &s;ome have knowledge and certain qualities, and di&s;po&s;itions, which bring them nearer to the chri&s;tian &s;tate than others. For altho' I freely acknow|ledge that there is no man out of this kingdom, let him be never &s;o near to it, but it requires an act of divine power and &s;overeign grace, to bring him actually into it: for no man cometh to the Son <HI>but whom the Father draweth,</HI> Joh. vi. 44. and regeneration is of the Spirit of God. (Joh. 3.5.) yet it does not follow, but that they may be &s;o pre|pared, if not by natural temper, yet by education in&s;truction, example, con&s;ideration and thought, and by the free en|joyment of the means of grace, as to be &s;o much nearer the kingdom than others, as not to need &s;o much to be done for them at the time of actually bringing them into the kingdom as &s;ome others. Who will &s;ay but that <HI>Agrippa</HI> was nearer the kingdom than &s;ome others, who was <HI>almo&s;t</HI> per&s;waded to be a chri&s;tian. Divines have been won't to di&s;tingui&s;h between common and &s;pecial grace: and as among tho&s;e who are favoured with &s;pecial grace, &s;ome at|tain to higher degrees than others; &s;o it is as to common
<PB N="28" REF="009326_0031_1030EE5A556C0DF8">grace: it mu&s;t be allowed that &s;ome make a much better improvement of common grace than others. And who will &s;ay that tho&s;e who make the be&s;t improvement and greate&s;t attainments in common grace, are &s;o far from the kingdom of God, and bid no fairer to enter into it, than tho&s;e who make no, or but very poor improvement of the grace God affords them in common with others?</P>
<P>But now as to per&s;ons being near or far off from the kingdom; it is often very different from the common ap|prehen&s;ions of men in the matter. &mdash; No people were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o near the kingdom of God, &amp; of the Me&s;&s;iah, as the Jews; and yet, as I ob&s;erved before, perhaps no people in their temper were further from the kingdom than they: And among the Jews, none were thought &s;o near the kingdom as the phari&s;ees: it being a common &s;aying among the Jews, <Q>that if but two men went to heaven, one of them would be a phari&s;ee:</Q> whereas in truth, there were none a|mong the Jews further from the kingdom than they. In|&s;omuch that our Saviour ob&s;erves that <HI>publicans and har|lots would &s;ooner enter into the kingdom of heaven than they,</HI> Matth. xxi. 31. And he illu&s;trates it by a parable, &s;etting forth the different tempers of a phari&s;ee and a pub|lican, <HI>Luk.</HI> xviii. 10 &mdash; 14. Two men went up into the tem|ple to pray, one a <HI>phari&s;ee,</HI> the other a <HI>publican.</HI> The phari&s;ee, &s;tood and prayed thus with him&s;elf, "God I thank thee, I am not as other men are, extortioners, unju&s;t, adul|terers, or even as this publican: I fa&s;t twice a week, and I give tythes of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s: And the publican &s;tand|ing afar off, would not &s;o much as lift up his eyes to hea|ven; but &s;mote upon his brea&s;t, God be merciful to me a &s;inner. I tell you, this man went down to his hou&s;e ju&s;tified rather than the other: for every one who exalteth him&s;elf &s;hall be aba&s;ed; but he who humbleth him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted." By which it appears, that &s;in|ners who have &s;ome humble &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins, are nearer the kingdom, and in a much fairer way than proud &s;elf-righteous hypocrites. For nothing is more contrary to the genius and &s;pirit of the go&s;pel kingdom than pride; and the very nature &amp; tendency of the go&s;pel kingdom is to humble
<PB N="29" REF="009326_0032_1030EE61E964E898">pride; and bring down the haughtine&s;s of man, that the Lord alone, and his rich and free grace may be exalted.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We may gather from what hath been &s;aid that good knowledge in religious matters, with moral hone&s;ty and ingenuity, bids fair for the kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>The favourable remark Chri&s;t makes upon the &s;cribe's an&s;wer, teaches us, that when per&s;ons are willing to know the doctrines and principles of the go&s;pel, and are &s;o ho|ne&s;t and ingenuous, as to own and acknowledge the truth thereof, as it appears to them, they are in a much more hope|ful way than tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e knowledge, and neglect the means of knowledge: and reject the truth when it is offered unto them; and deny it when convinced of it: when men choo&s;e darkne&s;s rather than light, and ob&s;tinate|ly per&s;i&s;t in error rather than embrace the truth, they are very remote from that kingdom which is founded in truth.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A right under&s;tanding of the law in all its high demands upon us, &s;erves to bring us &s;o much nearer to the kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>It is by the law that there is the knowledge of &s;in: for &s;in is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law of God. Now therefore, the more clear and exten&s;ive views we have of the divine law in the numerous demands and various requirements of it, with all the awful penal &s;anctions thereof, the better &s;hall we be prepared to receive the go&s;pel: for if we thus &s;ee and under&s;tand the law, we &s;hall &s;ee that we are guilty before God: and without a Mediator, and an intere&s;t in him, under the divine wrath and cur&s;e, and liable to death and eternal de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Now &s;urely, a &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things mu&s;t needs very much prepare for the go&s;pel kingdom; which i&s;&s;ues forth a proclamation of grace inviting the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the divine law, to come in, a&s;&s;uring them, that who&s;oever com|eth to Chri&s;t, he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out; but &s;hall thro' him obtain pardon, ju&s;tification and eternal life. The law then in all it's rigorous, but righteous demands, may well be called a &s;chool-ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t, <HI>Gal</HI> iii. 24. For it &s;erves to give us &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of our own &s;in and guilt, as to put us upon fleeing from the tribunal of awful
<PB N="30" REF="009326_0033_1030EE6569A39778">and inflexible ju&s;tice, to pro&s;trate our &s;elves before the mercy-&s;eat prepared, and throne of grace erected in the go&s;pel kingdom. It is therefore of va&s;t importance that men &s;hould be well in&s;tructed in the law of God, and made to &s;ee how exceeding broad it is, and how exten&s;ive in its demands, and how dreadful in its penalties; as that which may be a &s;pecial means to put per&s;ons upon repair|ing to that divine per&s;on, who was made of a woman, and made under the law, to redeem us who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of &s;ons.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It is a bad &s;ign when per&s;ons content them&s;elves with the outward acts of religion, and have little or no regard to their hearts, and the affections of their &s;ouls.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ee the fir&s;t and great commandment is <HI>Love;</HI> and to love God with all the <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>&s;oul.</HI> Surely then &s;uch, who content them&s;elves with lifele&s;s heartle&s;s duties in religion, whatever they may think of them|&s;elves; or whatever others may think of them, are not near the kingdom; and their placing religion in outward <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and ceremony, and not in &s;incere and hear|ty affections has a &s;ad tendency to keep them at a di&s;tance. For &s;uch oftentimes <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">arter them&s;elves, that they are al|ready in the kingdom: and &s;uch a &s;elf flattering, and &s;elf-deceiving &s;pirit indulged, is a very dangerous &s;tate: for many of the means of grace, &s;uch as coun&s;els, warnings and reproofs which may reach others, won't be likely to affect the&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>How thankful &s;hould we be, for the &s;pecial advan|tages we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> for getting NEAR, but getting INTO the kingdom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>We have the go&s;pel of the kingdom preach'd to us; the proclamations of grace are i&s;&s;ued forth, with the terms up|on which we may be admitted and accepted: We have the &s;tatutes and ordinances of the kingdom publi&s;hed to us; and we are invited and called upon, yea intreated by the amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, to come into the kingdom; and the &s;pirit &s;ays <HI>come,</HI> by &s;tirring up convictions and good moti|ons; and in &s;hort, there are no means, helps or encourage|ments, which it is rea&s;onable for God to grant, but he is
<PB N="31" REF="009326_0034_1030EE66FB206DC8">ready to afford unto us. Surely then, the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing means and helps call for our mo&s;t thankful acknowledg|ments; and we &s;hould ble&s;s the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is thus ble&s;&s;ing us with &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly things in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>It greatly concerns us all to examine our &s;elves in this matter, and &s;ee how it is with us; and how we &s;tand related to the kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>It is of infinite importance to be in this kingdom; for the kingdom of grace here, and the kingdom of glory here|after, are in&s;eperably connected. Surely then, it infinitely concerns every one of us to &s;ee, and &s;o far as we are able to know how we &s;tand related to this kingdom.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, <HI>Whether we are in this kingdom.</HI> Many of you are vi&s;ibly and profe&s;&s;edly in this kingdom; and mo&s;t of you by bapti&s;m, are vi&s;ibly the children of the kingdom. But now I be&s;eech you con&s;ider and inquire, whether you be really in this kingdom: have you felt the power of this kingdom upon your &s;ouls, and working ef|fectually within you? Are you convinced of your lo&s;t and undone &s;tate, by rea&s;on of &s;in, and without a &s;aviour? Do you by an eye of faith, &s;ee Je&s;us to be the only and all-&s;ufficient Saviour? and do you receive him, and rely upon him as he is revealed and offered to you in his go&s;pel? Does the grace of the go&s;pel operate upon you? Are you become the willing &s;ubjects of this glorious king? Have you openly profe&s;&s;ed him, and &s;worn allegiance to him? have you his &s;pirit ruling in you? Are you con|formed to the &s;pirit of this kingdom? Do you live as this grace of God teaches you, denying ungodline&s;s, and every worldly lu&s;t, and living &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and god|ly in the pre&s;ent world? And do you walk in all the ordinances and commandments of the Lord blamele&s;s? In &s;hort, do you bear and bring forth the fruits of the king|dom, &s;uch as faith, love, holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s? Now if this be the ca&s;e, you may be congratulated as happy &s;ubjects of this kingdom of grace, and heirs of the kingdom of glory.</P>
<P>Secondly, if you cannot find that you are as yet in the
<PB N="32" REF="009326_0035_1030EE6892EA4CE8">kingdom, <HI>con&s;ider and inquire whether ye be near or far off.</HI></P>
<P>Are you not near the kingdom? Is not the kingdom of God among you? Is not the go&s;pel of the kingdom preach|ed unto you? Are you not invited and called upon to come in by friends &amp; by mini&s;ters? And is not the &s;pirit of God &s;triving with you? And is not God waiting upon you, keeping the door open to you, to &s;ee if you will come in? And don't &s;ome of you find your &s;elves upon the point of coming in? Are you not forming re&s;olutions that you will make ha&s;te, and make no more delay in this mat|ter? But then, let me a&s;k &s;ome of you, whether you are not gone further from the kingdom than you were &s;ome time ago? Have you not by neglecting the awakenings and convictions which have been &s;tirred up in you, very much lo&s;t them? And have you not by quenching and grieving the &s;pirit provoked him to withdraw, and has he not left you in a greater dulne&s;s, coldne&s;s &amp; backwardne&s;s to the things of God, than in times pa&s;t? Now if any of you upon examining and ob&s;erving your &s;elves, find this to be your ca&s;e, Oh! how &s;hould it alarm your fears, le&s;t the &s;pirit of God &s;hould utterly leave you, and you &s;hould never enter into the kingdom. O ye delaying &s;inners! you &s;hould con&s;ider how long God has been calling and waiting upon you; and if you don't be&s;tir your &s;elves &s;peedily, and in good earne&s;t, all your re&s;olutions will grow more &amp; more feeble; and all the hopeful pro&s;pects will vani&s;h, and the door of the kingdom will be for ever &s;hut again&s;t you.</P>
<P N="7">7. And to conclude: <HI>How &s;ad and dreadful will the ca&s;e of &s;uch be, who tho' they are not far from the king|dom of God, yet by &s;ome means or other, fall &s;hort at la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Whether this was the ca&s;e of the &s;cribe in our text we cannot &s;ay; but this we have rea&s;on to fear is the &s;ad ca&s;e of many per&s;ons under the go&s;pel. They have a good degree of knowledge in &s;piritual matters, and in the nature of the go&s;pel kingdom; and have many awakenings and convictions; and are brought to many purpo&s;es and pro|mi&s;es, relating to their coming into the go&s;pel church and
<PB N="33" REF="009326_0036_1030EE6C18503A58">kingdom: but by neglecting to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame, they fail of the grace of God; never get into the kingdom of grace here, &amp; &s;o finally rejected as to the kingdom of glory.</P>
<P>But now, how &s;ad will the ca&s;e of &s;uch be, &amp; how aggra|vated their grief and mi&s;ery, to think they were near the kingdom, within a &s;tep or two of entring in; and yet for not actually entring, are for ever rejected? Oh! how will it cut &s;uch poor wretches to the heart, to think the door of the kingdom &s;tood open to them, and God called and invited them by his word, by his mini&s;ters, and by his &s;pi|rit, and waited on them from month to month, from year to year; but they &s;till delayed, and practically refu&s;ed, and now the door is everla&s;tingly &s;hut again&s;t them? How will it cut them to think that by in&s;tructions and coun&s;els, a|wakenings and convictions, they were brought near the kingdom, and upon the very point of entring in; but de|layed &amp; delayed till their opportunity was lap&s;ed, &amp; they are for ever rejected! With what angui&s;h and vexation of &s;pirit, will they be filled, to think that once they were as it were near to heaven's gates; but for want of that faith, that re&s;olution, the go&s;pel required, they fell &s;hort! And with what everla&s;ting upbraiding of them&s;elves will they be filled, when they &s;ee not only <HI>Abraham,</HI> and all the pro|phets in the kingdom of God; but &s;hall &s;ee them come from the ea&s;t &amp; from the we&s;t, from the north and from the &s;outh, &amp; &s;it down with them in the kingdom of God; while they, the children of the kingdom, children of the church, and vi&s;ible members of the kingdom, and under the enjoy|ment of the be&s;t means, are thru&s;t out.</P>
<P>O may you, my hearers, who are at the door of the kingdom, but not come in as yet, be&s;tir your &s;elves &s;peedi|ly and in good earne&s;t, that this may not be your unhappy ca&s;e! And may God by his almighty grace, overcome all remaining reluctance, and bring you in!</P>
