<P>WHEN MAN came fir&s;t out of the Hands of the great CREATOR, cloath'd in Bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as well as in Soul, with Immortality and Inco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ruption, there was no Place for Phy&s;ick, or t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Art of Healing. As he knew no Sin, &s;o h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> knew no Pain, no Sickne&s;s, Weakne&s;s, or bodily Di&s;order. The Habitation wherein the angelick Mind, the <HI>Divinae Particula Aurae</HI> abode, altho' originally formed out of the Du&s;t of the Earth, was liable to no Decay. It had no Seeds of Cor|ruption or Di&s;&s;olution within it&s;elf. And there was nothing without to injure it: Heaven and Earth, and all the Ho&s;ts of them, were mild, benign and friendly to human Nature. The en|tire Creation was at Peace with Man, &s;o long as Man was at Peace with his Creator. So that well might the Morning Stars &s;ing together, and all the Sons of GOD &s;hout for Joy.</P>
<P N="2">2. But &s;ince Man rebell'd again&s;t the Sove|reign of Heaven and Earth, how entirely is the Scene changed? The incorruptible Frame hath put on Corruption, the Immortal has put on Mor|tality. The Seeds of Weakne&s;s and Pain, of Sickne&s;s and Death, are now lodged in our in|mo&s;t Sub&s;tance: Whence a thou&s;and Di&s;orders
<PB N="iv" REF="009867_0004_0F7B33110C3CB0C0">
continually &s;pring, even without the Aid of ex|ternal Violence. And how is the Number of the&s;e increa&s;ed, by every Thing round about us? The Heavens, the Earth, and all Things con|tained therein, con&s;pire to puni&s;h the Rebels a|gain&s;t their Creator. The Sun and Moon &s;hed unwhol&s;ome Influences from above; the Earth exhales poi&s;onous Damps from beneath: The Bea&s;ts of the Field, the Birds of the Air, the Fi&s;hes of the Sea, are in a State of Ho&s;tility: The Air it&s;elf, that &s;urrounds us on every Side, is replete with the Shafts of Death: Yea, the Food we eat, daily &s;aps the Foundation of the Life, which cannot be &s;u&s;tained without it. So has the LORD of All &s;ecured the Execution of his Decree, <Q>Du&s;t thou art, and unto Du&s;t &s;halt thou return.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. But can there Nothing be found to le&s;&s;en tho&s;e Inconveniencies, which cannot be wholly removed? To &s;often the Evils of Life, and pre|vent in Part the Sickne&s;s and Pain to which we are continually expo&s;ed? Without Que&s;tion there may. One grand Preventive of Pain and Sick|ne&s;s of various Kinds, &s;eems intimated by the great Author of Nature, in the very Sentence that intails Death upon us: <HI>"In the Sweat of thy Face &s;halt thou eat Bread, 'til thou return to the Ground."</HI> The Power of Exerci&s;e, both to pre&s;erve and re&s;tore Health, is greater than can well be conceived: E&s;pecially in tho&s;e who add Tempe|rance thereto; who, if they do not confine them|&s;elves altogether to eat either <Q>Bread, or the
<PB N="v" REF="009867_0005_0F7B3312308FCEF8">
Herb of the Field,</Q> (which GOD does not re|quire them to do) yet &s;teadily ob&s;erve both that Kind and Mea&s;ure of Food. which Experience &s;hews to be mo&s;t friendly to Health and Strength.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'Tis probable PHYSICK, as well as RELIGI|ON, was in the fir&s;t Ages chiefly traditional: Every Father delivering down to his Sons, what he had him&s;elf in like Manner received, concerning the Manner of healing both outward Hurts, and the Di&s;ea&s;es incident to each Climate, and the Me|dicines which were of the greate&s;t Efficacy for the Cure of each Di&s;order. 'Tis certain, this is the Method wherein the Art of Healing is pre&s;erved among the <HI>Americans,</HI> to this Day. Their Di&s;|ea&s;es, indeed, are exceeding few; nor do they often occur, by Rea&s;on of their continual Exer|ci&s;e, and ('til of late, univer&s;al) Temperance. But if any is &s;ick, or bit by a Serpent, or torn by a wild Bea&s;t, the Fathers immediately tell their Children what Remedy to apply. And 'tis rare, that the Patient &s;uffers long; tho&s;e Medicines be|ing quick, as well as generally infaliible.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence perhaps it was that the Antients, not only of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> but even of barba|rous Nations, u&s;ually a&s;&s;ign'd Phy&s;ick a Divine Original. And indeed it was a natural Thought, That He who had taught it to the very Bea&s;ts and Birds, the <HI>Cretan</HI> Stag, the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Ibis, could not be wanting to teach Man;
<Q>Sanctius his Animal, menti&s;que capacius altae:</Q>
Yea, &s;ometimes, even by tho&s;e meaner Crea|tures:
<PB N="vi" REF="009867_0006_0F7B33129C384DE0">
For it was ea&s;y to infer, "If this will heal that Creature, who&s;e Fle&s;h is nearly of the &s;ame Texture with mine, then in a parallel Ca&s;e it will heal me." The Trial was made. The Cure was wrought. And Experience and Phy|&s;ick grew up together.</P>
<P N="6">6. And has not the Author of Nature taught us the U&s;e of many other Medicines, but what is vulgarly term'd Accident? Thus one walking &s;ome Years &s;ince in a Grove of Pines, at a Time when many in the neighbouring Town were af|flicted with a Kind of new Di&s;temper, little Sores in the In&s;ide of the Mouth, a Drop of na|tural Gum fell from one of the Trees on the Book which he was reading. This he took up, and thoughtle&s;ly applied to one of tho&s;e &s;ore Pla|ces. Finding the Pain immediately cea&s;e, he applied it to another, which was al&s;o pre&s;ently healed. The &s;ame Remedy he afterwards im|parted to others, and it did not fail to heal any that applied it. And doubtle&s;s numberle&s;s Re|medies have been thus ca&s;ually di&s;covered in eve|ry Age and Nation.</P>
<P N="7">7. Thus far Phy&s;ick was wholly founded on Experiment. The <HI>European,</HI> as well as the <HI>Ame|rican,</HI> &s;aid to his Neighbour, Are you &s;ick? Drink the Juice of this Herb, and your Sickne&s;s will be at an End. Are you in a burning Heat? Leap into that River, and then &s;weat 'til you are well. Has the Snake bitten you? Chew, and apply that Root, and the Poi&s;on will not hurt you. Thus antient Men, having a little Expe|rience,
<PB N="vii" REF="009867_0007_0F7B33157B251918">
joined with common Sen&s;e, and common Humanity, cured both them&s;elves and their Neighbours, of mo&s;t of the Di&s;tempers to which every Nation was &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="8">8. But in Proce&s;s of Time, Men of a philo|&s;ophical Turn were not &s;atisfied with this. They began to enquire, How they might account for the&s;e Things? How &s;uch Medicines wrought &s;uch Effects? They examined the human Body, and all its Parts; the Nature of the Fle&s;h, Veins, Arteries, Nerves; the Structure of the Brain, Heart, Lungs, Stomach, Bowels; with the Springs of the &s;everal Animal Functions. They explored the &s;everal Kinds of Animal and Mine|ral, as well as Vegetable Sub&s;tances. And hence the whole Order of Phy&s;ick which had obtained to that Time, came gradually to be inverted. Men of Learning began to &s;et Experience a&s;ide; to build Phy&s;ick upon Hypothe&s;is; to form Theories of Di&s;ea&s;es and their Cure, and to &s;ub|&s;titute the&s;e in the Place of Experiments.</P>
<P N="9">9. As Theories increa&s;ed, &s;imple Medicines were more and more di&s;regarded and di&s;u&s;ed: 'til, in a Cour&s;e of Years, the greater Part of them were forgotten, at lea&s;t in the politer Na|tions. In the Room of the&s;e, Abundance of new Ones were introduced, by rea&s;oning, &s;peculative Men; and tho&s;e more and more difficult to be applied, as being more remote from common Ob&s;ervation. Hence Rules for the Application of the&s;e, and Medical Books, were immen&s;ely mul|tiplied; 'til at length Phy&s;ick became an ab&s;tru&s;e Science, quite out of the Reach of ordinary Men.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="viii" REF="009867_0008_0F7B331611AB8388">10. Phy&s;icians now began to be had in Admi|ration, as Per&s;ons who were &s;omething more than human. And Profit attended their Em|ploy, as well as Honour; &s;o that they had now two weighty Rea&s;ons for keeping the Bulk of Mankind at a Di&s;tance, that they might not pry into the My&s;teries of the Profe&s;&s;ion. To this End they increa&s;ed tho&s;e Difficulties by De&s;ign, which began in a Manner by Accident. They filled their Writings with Abundance of Technical Terms, utterly unintelligible to plain Men. They affected to deliver their Rules, and to rea|&s;on upon them, in an ab&s;tru&s;e and philo&s;ophical Manner. They repre&s;ented the critical Know|ledge of Anatomy, Natural Philo&s;ophy, (and what not? Some of them in&s;i&s;ting on that of A|&s;tronomy and A&s;trology too) as nece&s;&s;arily pre|vious to the under&s;tanding the Art of Healing. Tho&s;e who under&s;tood only, How to re&s;tore the Sick to Health, they branded with the Name of Empiricks. They introduced into Practice, A|bundance of compound Medicines, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;o many Ingredients, that it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for common People to know which it was that wrought a Cure: Abundance of Exoticks, nei|ther the Nature nor Names of which their own Countrymen under&s;tood: Of Chymicals, &s;uch as they neither had Skill, nor Fortune, nor Time, to prepare: Yea, and of dangerous Ones, &s;uch as they could not u&s;e without hazarding Life, but by the Advice of a Phy&s;ician. And thus both their Honour and Gain were &s;ecured; a va&s;t
<PB N="ix" REF="009867_0009_0F7B33171B9F9820">
Majority of Mankind being utterly cut off from helping either them&s;elves or their Neighbours, or once daring to attempt it.</P>
<P N="11">11. Yet there have not been wanting from Time to Time, &s;ome Lovers of Mankind, who have endeavoured (even contrary to their own Intere&s;t) to reduce Phy&s;ick to its antient Stand|dard: Who have laboured to explode out of it all Hypothe&s;es, and fine-&s;pun Theories, and to make it a plain intelligible Thing, as it was in the Beginning; having no more My&s;tery in it than this, "Such a Medicine removes &s;uch a Pain." The&s;e have demon&s;trably &s;hewn, That neither the Knowledge of A&s;trology, A&s;tronomy, Natural Philo&s;ophy, nor even Anatomy it&s;elf, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the quick and effectual Cure of mo&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es incident to human Bodies: Nor yet any Chymical, or Exotick, or Compound Medicine, but a &s;ingle Plant or Fruit duly appli|ed. So that every Man of common Sen&s;e (unle&s;s in &s;ome rare Ca&s;es) may pre&s;cribe either to him|&s;elf or his Neighbour; and may be very &s;ecure from doing Harm, even where he can do no Good.</P>
<P N="12">12. Even to the la&s;t Age there was &s;omething of this Kind done, particularly by the great and good Dr. <HI>Sydenham:</HI> And in the pre&s;ent, by his Pupil Dr. <HI>Dover,</HI> who has pointed out &s;imple Medicines for many Di&s;ea&s;es. And &s;ome &s;uch may be found in the Writings of the learned and ingenious Dr. <HI>Cheyne:</HI> Who doubtle&s;s would have communicated many more to the World,
<PB N="x" REF="009867_0010_0F7B3317D2BA99F8">
but for the melancholy Rea&s;on he gave one of his Friends, that pre&s;t him with &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in his Works, which too much countenanced the modern Practice, "O Sir, We mu&s;t do &s;ome|thing to oblige the Faculty, or they will tear us in Pieces."</P>
<P N="13">13. Without any Regard to this, without any Concern about the obliging or di&s;obliging any Man living, a mean Hand has made here &s;ome little Attempt toward a plain and ea&s;y Way of curing mo&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es. I have only con&s;ulted herein, Experience, common Sen&s;e, and the common Intere&s;t of Mankind. And &s;uppo&s;ing they can be cured this ea&s;y Way, who would de|&s;ire to u&s;e any other? Who would not wi&s;h to have a Phy&s;ician always in his Hou&s;e, and one that attends without Fee or Reward? To be able (unle&s;s in &s;ome few complicated Ca&s;es) to pre|&s;cribe to his Family, as well as him&s;elf?</P>
<P N="14">14. If it be &s;aid, But what Need is there of &s;uch an Attempt? I an&s;wer, The greate&s;t that can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived. Is it not needful in the highe&s;t Degree, to re&s;cue Men from the Jaws of De&s;truction? From wa&s;ting their For|tunes, as Thou&s;ands have done, and continue to do daily&punc; From pining away in Sickne&s;s and Pain, either through the Ignorance or Knavery of Phy&s;icians? Yea, and many Times throwing away their Lives, after their Health, and Time, and Sub&s;tance?</P>
<P>Is it enquired, But are there not Books enough already, on every Part of the Art of Medicine?
<PB N="xi" REF="009867_0011_0F7B331887B81AD0">
Yes, too many, ten Times over, con&s;idering how little to the Purpo&s;e the far greater Part of them &s;peak. But be&s;ide this, they are too dear for poor Men to buy, and too hard for plain Men to under&s;tand. Do you &s;ay, But there are e|nough of the&s;e Collections of Receipts. Where? I have not &s;een One yet, either in our own or a|ny other Tongue, which contains only &s;afe and cheap and ea&s;y Medicines. In all that have yet fallen into my Hands, I find many dear and ma|ny far-fetch'd Medicines; many of of &s;o dange|rous a Kind, as a prudent Man would never meddle with. And again&s;t the greater Part of tho&s;e Medicines there is a further Objection: They con&s;i&s;t of too many Ingredients. The com|mon Method of compounding and decompoun|ding Medicines, can never be reconciled to com|mon Sen&s;e. Experience &s;hews, That one Thing will cure mo&s;t Di&s;orders, at lea&s;t as well as twen|ty put together. Then why do you add the other nineteen? Only to &s;well the Apothecary's Bill: Nay, po&s;&s;ible, on purpo&s;e to prolong the Di&s;|temper, that the Doctor and he may divide the Spoil</P>
<P>But admitting there is &s;ome Quality in the Medicine propo&s;ed, which has Need to be cor|rected: Will not one Thing correct it, as well as twenty? It is probable, much better. And if not, there is Sufficiency of other. Medicines, which need no &s;uch Correction.</P>
<P>How often, by thus compounding Medicines of oppo&s;ite Qualities, is the Virtue of both utter|ly
<PB N="xii" REF="009867_0012_0F7B331948B8F4B8">
de&s;troyed? Nay, how often do tho&s;e joined to|gether de&s;troy Life, which &s;ingle might have pre&s;erved it? This occa&s;ioned that Caution of the great <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> again&s;t mixing Things without evident Nece&s;&s;ity, and without full Proof of the Effect they will produce when joined together, as well as of that they produced when a&s;under: See|ing (as he ob&s;erves) &s;everal Things, which &s;epa|rately taken, are &s;afe and powerful Medicines, when compounded not only lo&s;e their former Pow+ers, but commence a &s;trong and deadly Poi&s;on.</P>
<P N="15">15. As to the Manner of u&s;ing the Medicines here &s;et down, I &s;hould advi&s;e as &s;oon as you know your Di&s;temper, (which is very ea&s;y, unle&s;s in a Complication of Di&s;orders, and then you would do well to apply to a Phy&s;ician that fears GOD) Fir&s;t, u&s;e the fir&s;t of the Remedies for that Di&s;|ea&s;e which occurs in the en&s;uing Collection; un|le&s;s &s;ome other of them be ea&s;ier to be had, and then it may do ju&s;t as well.) Secondly, After a competent Time, if it takes no Effect, u&s;e the &s;e|cond, the third, and &s;o on. I have purpo&s;ely &s;et down (in mo&s;t Ca&s;es) &s;everal Remedies for each Di&s;order; not only becau&s;e All are not equally ea&s;y to be procured at all Times and in all Places: But likewi&s;e becau&s;e the Medicine which cures one Man, will not always cure ano|ther of the &s;ame Di&s;temper. Nor will it cure the &s;ame Man at all Times. Therefore it was nece&s;|&s;ary to have a Variety. However, I have &s;ub|join'd the Letter <HI>I</HI> to tho&s;e Medicines, which are &s;aid to be infallible.&mdash;Thirdly, Ob&s;erve all the
<PB N="xiii" REF="009867_0013_0F7B331AF90AC0B0">
Time the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s in your Regimen, or manner of Living. Ab&s;tain from all mixt, or all high &s;ea&s;on'd Food. U&s;e plain Diet, ea&s;y of Dige&s;tion: And this as &s;paringly as you can, con|&s;i&s;tent with Ea&s;e and Strength. Drink only Wa|ter, if it agrees with your Stomach; if not, good clear Small-beer. U&s;e as much Exerci&s;e daily, in the open Air, as you can without Wearine&s;s. Sup at Six or Seven on the lighte&s;t Food: Go to Bed early, and ri&s;e betimes, To per&s;evere with Steadine&s;s in this Cour&s;e, is often more than half the Cure. Above all, add to the re&s;t, (for it is not Labour lo&s;t) that old, unfa&s;hionable Medi|cine, PRAYER. And have Faith in GOD, who <HI>"killeth and maketh alive, who bringeth down to the Grave and bringeth up."</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. For the Sake of tho&s;e who de&s;ire, through the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, to retain the Health which they have recovered, I have added a few plain ea&s;y Rules, chiefly tran&s;cribed from Dr. <HI>Cheyne.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. The Air we breathe is of great Con&s;e|quence to our Health. Tho&s;e who have been long abroad in Ea&s;terly or Northerly Winds, &s;hould drink &s;ome thin and warm Liquor going to Bed: or a Draught of Toa&s;t and Water.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tender People &s;hould have tho&s;e who lie with them or are much about them, &s;ound, &s;weet and healthy.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every one that would pre&s;erve Health, &s;hould be as clean and &s;weet as po&s;&s;ible in their Hou&s;es, Cloaths, and Furniture.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. The great Rule of Eating and Drinking is,
<PB N="xiv" REF="009867_0014_0F7B331B878483C8">
To &s;uit the Quality and Quantity of Food to the Strength of our Dege&s;tion; to take always &s;uch a Sort and &s;uch a Mea&s;ure of Food, as &s;its light and ea&s;y on the Stomach.</P>
<P N="2">2. All pickled, or &s;moaked, or &s;alted Food, and all high-&s;ea&s;on'd is unwhol&s;ome.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nothing conduces more to Health, than Ab&s;tinence and plain Food, with due Labour.</P>
<P N="4">4. For &s;tudious Per&s;ons, about eight Ounces of Animal Food, and twelve of Vegetable in twenty-four Hours is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P N="5">5. Water is the whol&s;ome&s;t of all Drinks; quickens the Appetite and &s;trengthens the Di|ge&s;tion mo&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. Strong, and more e&s;pecially &s;pirituous Li|quors, are a certain though &s;low Poi&s;on.</P>
<P N="7">7. Experience &s;hews, there is no Manner of Danger, in leaving them off all at once.</P>
<P N="8">8. Strong Liquors do not prevent the Mi&s;|chiefs of a Surfeit, nor carry it off &s;o &s;afely as Water.</P>
<P N="9">9. Malt Liquors (except clear Small bear of a due Age) are exceeding hurtful to tender Per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="10">10. Coffee and Tea are extremely hurtful to Per&s;ons who have weak Nerves.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. Tender Per&s;ons &s;hould eat very light Suppers; and that two or three Hours before going to Bed.</P>
<P N="2">2. They ought con&s;tantly to go to Bed a|bout Nine, and ri&s;e at Four or Five.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. A due Degree of Exerci&s;e is indi&s;|pen&s;ably
<PB N="xv" REF="009867_0015_0F7B331E948C5488">
nece&s;&s;ary to Health and long Life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Walking is the be&s;t Exerci&s;e for tho&s;e who are able to bear it. Riding for tho&s;e who are not. The open Air, when the Weather is fair, contributes much to the Benefit of Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. We may &s;trengthen any weak Part of the Body by con&s;tant Exerci&s;e. Thus the Lungs may be &s;trengthened by loud &s;peaking, or wal|king up an ea&s;y A&s;cent. The Arms or Hams by &s;trongly rubbing them daily.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Studious ought to have &s;tated Times for Exerci&s;e, at lea&s;t two or three Hours a Day: The one half of this before Dinner, the other before going to Bed.</P>
<P N="5">5. They &s;hould frequently &s;have, and fre|quently wa&s;h their Feet.</P>
<P N="6">6. Tho&s;e who read or write much, &s;hould learn to do it &s;tanding; otherwi&s;e it will impare their Health.</P>
<P N="7">7. The fewer Cloaths any one u&s;es, by Day or Night, the hardier he will be.</P>
<P N="8">8. Exerci&s;e, fir&s;t, &s;hould be always on an emp|ty Stomach; &s;econdly, &s;hould never be continu|ed to Wearine&s;s; thirdly, after it, we &s;hould take Care to cool by Degrees. Otherwi&s;e we &s;hall catch Cold.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Fle&s;h-bru&s;h is a mo&s;t u&s;eful Exerci&s;e e&s;pecially to &s;trengthen any Part that is weak.</P>
<P N="10">10. Cold-bathings is a great Advantage to Health. It prevents Abundance of Di&s;ea&s;es. It promotes Per&s;piration, helps the Circulation of the Blood, and prevents the Danger of catch|ing
<PB N="xvi" REF="009867_0016_0F7B331F5FFF73B8">
Cold. Tender People &s;hould pour Water upon the Head before they go in, and walk in, &s;wiftly. To jump in with the Head foremo&s;t, is too great a Shock to Nature.</P>
<P N="5">V. 1. Co&s;tivene&s;s cannot long con&s;i&s;t with Health. Therefore Care &s;hould be taken to re|move it at the Begining; and when it is remo|ved, to prevent its Return, by &s;oft, cool, open|ing Diet.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ob&s;tructed Per&s;piration (vulgarly called catching Cold) is one great Source of Di&s;ea&s;es. Whenever there appears the lea&s;t Sign of this let it be removed by gentle Sweats.</P>
<P N="6">VI. 1. The Pa&s;&s;ions have a greater Influence on Health than mo&s;t People are aware of.</P>
<P N="2">2. All violent and &s;udden Pa&s;&s;ions di&s;po&s;e to, or actually throw People into acute Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;low and la&s;ting Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as Grief and hopele&s;s Love, bring on chronical Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'Till the Pa&s;&s;ion which cau&s;ed the Di&s;ea&s;e is calm'd, Medicine is applied in vain.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Love of GOD, as it is the &s;overeign Remedy of all Mi&s;eries, &s;o in particular it effec|tually prevents all the bodily Di&s;orders the Pa&s;|&s;ions introduce, by keeping the Pa&s;&s;ions them|&s;elves within due Bounds. And by the un&s;pea|kable Joy and perfect Calm, Serenity and Tran|quillity it gives the Mind, it becomes the mo&s;t powerful of all the Means of Health and long Life.</P>
