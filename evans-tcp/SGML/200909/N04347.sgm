<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE enclos'd which comes open, you will &s;ee is a CONFESSION, and RETRACTATION, of the Rev. Mr. JAMES DAVENPORT; which he left with me <HI>Ye&s;terday,</HI> and de&s;ir'd me to inclo&s;e in a Letter to you: praying that you would &s;ee that it is <HI>according to his De&s;ire forthwith publi&s;h'd,</HI> and <HI>made known in the mo&s;t open Manner.</HI> He de&s;ired me to a&s;&s;ure you that the <HI>whole of the Paper, and every Inter|line, was made and written with his own Hand.</HI> And <HI>he is full, and free in it,</HI> and &s;eems to be <HI>deeply &s;en&s;ible of his Mi&s;carriages, and Mi&s;conduct</HI> in tho&s;e Particu|lars, and <HI>very de&s;irous to do all he po&s;&s;ibly can to retreive the Di&s;honour which he has done to Religion,</HI> and <HI>the In|ju&s;tice to many Mini&s;ters</HI> of the Go&s;pel; and in this as well as any other Way to promote the Service of Re|ligion, and prevent any further Prejudices again&s;t the Work of God which he may have been the Occa&s;ion of rai&s;ing or increa&s;ing. I mu&s;t needs &s;ay for my own Part I de&s;ire to ble&s;s God for <HI>that humble, and Chri&s;|tian-like Temper</HI> he appears to be in; and can't but hope that God de&s;igns to u&s;e him as an In&s;trument of greater Service to the Honour of Chri&s;t, and the good of his Church. I am Sir with great Re&s;pect your un|worthy Brother and humble Servant,</P>

<HEAD>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI>'s Retractations.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHO' I don't que&s;tion at all, but there is great Rea&s;on to ble&s;s God for a <HI>glorious and wonderful Work of his Power and Grace</HI> in the <HI>Edification</HI> of his Chil|dren, and the <HI>Conviction</HI> and <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of Num|bers in <HI>New-England,</HI> in the <HI>neighbouring Govern|ments</HI> and <HI>&s;everal other Parts,</HI> within a few Years pa&s;t; and believe that the Lord hath favoured me, tho' mo&s;t unworthy, with &s;everal others of his Servants, in granting &s;pecial A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Succe&s;s; the Glory of all which be given to JEHOVAH, to whom alone it belongs:</P>
<P>Yet after frequent Meditation and De&s;ires that I might be enabled to apprehend Things ju&s;tly, and, I hope I may &s;ay, mature Con&s;ideration; I am now fully convinced and per&s;uaded, that <HI>&s;everal Appendages</HI> to <HI>this glorious Work</HI> are no e&s;&s;ential Parts thereof, but of a <HI>different</HI> and <HI>con|trary</HI> Nature and Tendency; <HI>which Appendages</HI> I have been in the Time of the Work very in|du&s;trious in and in&s;trumental of promoting, by a mi&s;guided Zeal: being further much influen|ced in the Affair by the <HI>fal&s;e Spirit;</HI> which, un|ob&s;erved
<PB N="4" REF="005374_0004_101828301AB979F8">
by me, did (as I have been brought to &s;ee &s;ince) prompt me to <HI>unju&s;t Apprehen&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;conduct</HI> in <HI>&s;everal Articles;</HI> which have been great Blemi&s;hes to the Work of God, very grievous to &s;ome of God's Children, no le&s;s en|&s;naring and corrupting to others of them, a &s;ad Means of many Per&s;ons que&s;tioning the Work of God, concluding and appearing again&s;t it, and of the hardening of Multitudes in their Sins, and an awful Occa&s;ion of the Enemies bla&s;phe|ming the right Ways of the Lord; and withal very offen&s;ive to that God, before whom I would lie in the Du&s;t, pro&s;trate in deep Humility and Repentance on this Account, imploring Pardon for the Mediator's Sake, and thankfully accepting the Tokens thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>Articles,</HI> which I e&s;pecially refer to, and would in the mo&s;t public Manner <HI>retract,</HI> and <HI>warn others again&s;t,</HI> are the&s;e which follow, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The Method I us'd for a con&s;iderable Time, with Re&s;pect to &s;ome, yea many <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> in &s;everal Parts, in openly <HI>expo&s;ing &s;uch as I fear'd or thought unconverted, in public Prayer or other|wi&s;e:</HI> herein making my private Judgment, (in which al&s;o I much &s;u&s;pect I was mi&s;taken in &s;e|veral In&s;tances, and I believe al&s;o that my Judg|ment concerning &s;everal, was formed ra&s;hly and upon very &s;lender Grounds.) I &s;ay making my
<PB N="5" REF="005374_0005_10180F22C6CCD458">
private Judgment, the Ground of public Actions or Conduct; offending, as I apprehend (altho' in the Time of it ignorantly) again&s;t the <HI>ninth Com|mandment,</HI> and &s;uch other Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, as are &s;imilar; yea, I may &s;ay, offending again&s;t the Laws both of Ju&s;tice and Charity: Which Laws were further broken,</P>
<P N="2">II. By my <HI>advi&s;ing and urging to &s;uch Separa|tions</HI> from <HI>tho&s;e Mini&s;ters,</HI> whom I treated as above, as I believe may ju&s;tly be called ra&s;h, un|warrantable, and of &s;ad and awful Tendency and Con&s;equence. And here I would a&s;k the For|givene&s;s of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, whom I have in|jured in both the&s;e Articles.</P>
<P N="3">III. I confe&s;s I have been much led a&s;tray by <HI>following Impul&s;es</HI> or Impre&s;&s;ions as a Rule of Conduct, whether they came with or without a Text of Scripture; and my neglecting al&s;o duly to ob&s;erve the Analogy of Scripture: I am per|&s;uaded this was a great Means of corrupting my Experiences and carrying me off from the Word of God, and a great Handle, which the <HI>fal&s;e Spirit</HI> has made u&s;e of with Re&s;pect to a Num|ber, and me e&s;pecially.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I believe further that I have done much Hurt to Religion by <HI>encouraging private Per&s;ons to a mini&s;terial and authoritative Kind or Method of exhorting;</HI> which is particularly ob&s;ervable in many &s;uch being much puft up and <HI>falling into
<PB N="6" REF="005374_0006_101828356D61B8B8">
the Snare of the Devil,</HI> while many others are thus directly prejudic'd again&s;t the Work.</P>
<P N="5">V. I have Rea&s;on to be deeply humbled that I have not been duly careful to endeavour to re|move or prevent Prejudice, (where I now be|lieve I might then have done it con&s;i&s;tently with Duty) which appear'd remarkable in the Me|thod. I practis'd, of <HI>&s;inging with others in the Streets</HI> in Societies frequently.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o penitently confe&s;s and bewail my <HI>great Stiffne&s;s</HI> in retaining the&s;e <HI>afore&s;aid Errors</HI> a great while, and Unwillingne&s;s to examine in|to them with any Jealou&s;y of their being Errors, notwith&s;tanding the friendly Coun&s;els and Cau|tions of real Friends, e&s;pecially in the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Here may properly be added a Paragraph or two, taken out of a <HI>Letter from me</HI> to Mr. <HI>Barber</HI> at <HI>Georgia;</HI> a <HI>true Copy</HI> of which I gave Con&s;ent &s;hould be publi&s;h'd lately at <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> <Q>&mdash; I would add to what Brother <HI>T</HI>&mdash; hath written on the awful Affair of Books and Cloaths at <HI>New-London,</HI> which affords Grounds of deep and la&s;ting Humiliation; I was to my Shame be it &s;poken, the Ringleader in <HI>that horrid Action;</HI> I was, my dear Brother, under the powerful Influence of the <HI>fal&s;e Spirit</HI> almo&s;t one whole Day together, and Part
<PB N="7" REF="005374_0007_1018283AA30D7AF0">
of &s;everal Days. The Lord &s;hewed me after|wards that the Spirit I was then acted by was in it's Operations void of true inward Peace, laying the greate&s;t Stre&s;s on Externals, neglec|ting the Heart, full of Impatience, Pride and Arrogance; altho' I thought in the Time of it, that 'twas the Spirit of God in an high Degree; awful indeed! my Body e&s;pecially my Leg much di&s;order'd at the &s;ame Time,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I had the <HI>long Fever</HI> on me and the cankry Hu|mour raging at once.</NOTE> which Satan and my evil Heart might make &s;ome Handle of.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>And now may the holy wi&s;e and good God, be pleas'd to guard and &s;ecure me again&s;t <HI>&s;uch Errors</HI> for the future, and &s;top the Progre&s;s of tho&s;e, whether Mini&s;ters or People, who have been corrupted by my Words or Example in any of the above mention'd Particulars; and if it be his holy Will, ble&s;s <HI>this public Recantation</HI> to this Purpo&s;e. And Oh! may he grant withal, that &s;uch as by Rea&s;on of the afore&s;aid <HI>Errors and Mi&s;conduct</HI> have entertained unhappy Prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;tianity in general, or the late glorious Work of God in particular, may by this Account learn to di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>Appendage</HI> from the <HI>Sub|&s;tance</HI> or <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> that which is <HI>vile</HI> and <HI>odious</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="005374_0008_1018283E46B27A40">
from that which is <HI>precious, glorious</HI> and <HI>divine,</HI> and thus be entirely and happily freed from all tho&s;e Prejudices refer'd to, and this in infinite Mercy through Je&s;us Chri&s;t: and to the&s;e Re|que&s;ts may all God's Children, whether Mini&s;ters or others &s;ay, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> In as much as a Number, who have fal|len in with and promoted the <HI>afore&s;aid Errors</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;conduct,</HI> and are not alter'd in their Minds, may be prejudic'd again&s;t this <HI>Recantation,</HI> by a Suppo&s;ition or Belief, that I came into it by Rea&s;on of De&s;ertion or Dulne&s;s and Deadne&s;s in Religion: It &s;eems needful therefore to &s;ignify, what I hope I may &s;ay without boa&s;ting, and what I am able thro' pure rich Grace to &s;peak with Truth and Freedom; that for <HI>&s;ome Months</HI> in the Time of my coming to the <HI>above&s;aid Conclu&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Retractations,</HI> and &s;ince I have come through Grace to them; I have been fa|voured a great Part of the Time, with a &s;weet <HI>Calm and Serenity of Soul and Re&s;t in God,</HI> and &s;ometimes with &s;pecial and remarkable Refre&s;h|ments of Soul, and the&s;e more free from corrupt Mixtures than formerly: <HI>Glory to God alone.</HI></P>
