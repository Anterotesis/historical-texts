<HEAD><HI>CIRCULAR LETTER, FROM THE Warren Bapti&s;t A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> Held at STURBRIDGE, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts State, September 8th and 9th, <HI>1789,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed by their Committee to the Churches in connection, and &s;ent with their Minutes to the corre&s;ponding A&s;&s;ociations.</HEAD>
<P>WE the committee who were appointed to revi&s;e and a|bridge the manu&s;cript of the Rev. Mr. Backus, on the &s;upport of the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, being at a di&s;tance from &s;uch other, found that we &s;hould be obliged to detain the mi|nutes too long from the pre&s;s, by attending to the bu&s;ine&s;s of our appointment, have therefore reprinted an extract from a &s;ermon on that &s;ubject, which was preached by a worthy mini&s;ter of our denomination in England 168<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, which we have taken from Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">each's</HI> metaphors, p. 259, and we hope will be acceptable to the churches. We pray God that old truths may have new ef|fects, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ix. 14 <HI>Even &s;o hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the go&s;pel, &s;hould live of the go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>'The&s;e words call not only for the maintenance of mini&s;ters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> for &s;uch a plentiful contribution, as may make them par|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">ers with you in all good things. If God ble&s;s the congre|gation with a plentiful portion of this world's goods, it is their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ty to make their mini&s;ter a party with them in their flouri&s;h|ing condition. And con&s;idering the place and employment he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and the &s;ervice he attends, it would be extremely unworthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> think you have done enough, if his pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities be an|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ered, while you abound in &s;uperfluities. If the congregation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> poor, their mini&s;ter mu&s;t be content to be poor with them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, rejoice to approve him&s;elf a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, by hunger and nakedne&s;s, if the providence of God call him thereto: but whil&s;t it is in the power of your hand to provide better for him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> expects it from you, and, <HI>be not deceived, God is not mocked,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ither will he &s;uffer his commands to be &s;lighted and evaded, wihout rendering a ju&s;t rebuke to the offender; <HI>for what&s;oever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> man &s;oweth, that &s;hall he al&s;o reap.</HI></P>
<P>'Now that you may the better under&s;tand how far you are concerned in this duty, before I proceed to the further pre&s;&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> it, let me put you in remembrance;</P>
<P N="1">'1. That a mini&s;ter is bound to attend wholly and only
<PB N="2" REF="022242_0002_0FB7705359D1F470">upon his calling in the mini&s;try, and not to entangle him&s;elf in the affairs of life, that he may plea&s;e him by whom he is called to his &s;piritual warfare; and nothing but real nece&s;&s;ity may di&s;|pen&s;e with the contrary. His whole time and &s;trength is little enough to be employed in the work and &s;ervice he is called to. He mu&s;t give him&s;elf to the mini&s;try of the word, and prayer, and continue in reading, meditation, &amp;c. as a man wholly de|voted to the go&s;pel &s;ervice; and is therefore, by his call to the mi|ni&s;try, &s;ecluded from tho&s;e ways and means of providing for his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, as the trades and &s;ecular employments of others furni&s;h them with, that his mind, by the cares of worldly bu&s;i|ne&s;s, may not be diverted from that &s;tudy of God's word, and care of &s;ouls, which the duty of his &s;tation engageth him to. And if he may not expo&s;e him&s;elf to the careful thoughts that accompany worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, though tending to his own profit, certainly it is no way meet, that he &s;hould be left to conflict with the cares of a nece&s;&s;itous condition, whil&s;t tho&s;e he mini&s;ters to have means to prevent it.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is no le&s;s the duty of a mini&s;ter than of other men, to provide for his family, and (what lies in him) to take care of his wife and children, that they may not be expo&s;ed to a thou|&s;and mi&s;eries and temptations, when he is gone. I confe&s;s, of all men in the world, a covetous, raking temper wor&s;t becomes a mini&s;ter; but we greatly mi&s;take, if we think he mu&s;t dive&s;t him&s;elf of the due affection of an hu&s;band towards his wife, or of a father towards his children; or, that the&s;e fruits thereof, which are ju&s;tly e&s;teemed commendable in others, &s;hould be a fault in him.</P>
<P N="3">3. An elder, or bi&s;hop is under a &s;pecial charge to u&s;e ho&s;pi|tality, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in him&s;elf a pattern of charity, and compa&s;|&s;ionate bounty to poor &s;ouls; and if it be his duty to be ho&s;pita|ble and charitable in an eminent degree, then without contro|ver&s;y the people are concerned to endeavour that he may be ca|pable of giving proof of this grace in him, by the exerci&s;e of it as there is occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>'The&s;e things being premi&s;ed, I &s;hall &s;hew you, that you lie under the &s;tronge&s;t obligation imaginable to this duty;
<LIST>
<ITEM>'1. By the law of nature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>'2. By the expre&s;s command and appointment of Chri&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>'3. On the account of the great and manife&s;t evil and in|convenience, that follows the neglect thereof.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>'Fir&s;t; The law and light of nature obligeth you to it, as to
<PB REF="022242_0002_0FB7705359D1F470"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> matter of equity and ju&s;tice. And from hence our apo&s;tle takes his fir&s;t plea, in 1 Cor. 9, 7. &amp;c. <HI>Who go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">th a warfare any time at his own charges? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eat|eth not the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</HI> The mini&s;try is a warfare, undertaken at the command of Chri&s;t, for the &s;ervice of your &s;ouls; and it is as rea&s;onable that the mini&s;ter &s;hould receive a &s;upply of outward things from you, as that a faithful &s;oldier &s;hould receive his pay from his captain, at the charge of the commonwealth, for who&s;e good he militates, Shall a man feed a flock (as a pa&s;tor does) and be denied to eat of the milk of that flock, which it is his work to keep and feed? Or, is it con&s;i&s;tent with common ju&s;tice, to deprive a man of the fruit of that Vineyard, which is planted and manured by his own labour? Such is the ca&s;e, in re&s;pect of maintenance, between a mini&s;ter and the people.&mdash;It is not your charity that I a&s;k for him, but ju&s;tice and debt that I plead for: he is employed in your &s;ervice, and of right &s;hould live upon your charge; nay, you have called him off from other bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore his maintenance is due from you, as is the wages of your &s;ervant, though I fear &s;ome give more to the meane&s;t &s;ervant in their hou&s;e, than they are willing to do to their mini&s;ter. Certainly, if you chu&s;e as you ought, your mi|ni&s;ters are not of the lowe&s;t of the people, but may be allowed to have a &s;hare of parts, common prudence, and ability for bu|&s;ine&s;s, with other men; and could manage trades, or fall into other employments, and get e&s;tates as well as you, if they were not <HI>devoted to a better &s;ervice:</HI> and mu&s;t they needs be devoted to nece&s;&s;ities and mi&s;ery, in the &s;ame hour that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> upon the mini&s;try? my brethren, this ought not to be. Let your mi|ni&s;ters have as good a treatment at lea&s;t, as the law provided for the <HI>ox that treads out the corn,</HI> who might not be <HI>muzzled.</HI> Nei|ther was this written for the &s;ake of oxen; for, <HI>doth God take care of oxen?</HI> or were there no higher end of this law, than that the brute creature &s;hould not be abu&s;ed? certainly there was; <HI>And for your &s;akes no doubt was this written, that he that ploweth, &s;hould plow in hope; and he that thre&s;heth in hope, &s;hould be partaker of his hope: for if we have &s;own unto you &s;piritual things, is it a great thing if we &s;hall reap your carnal things?</HI></P>
<P>'Secondly; The Lord hath not le&s;t us to argue this only from general principles of rea&s;on, and common equity; but to put the matter beyond di&s;pute, hath &s;uperadded his <HI>expre&s;s command</HI> Thus he provided for his mini&s;ters in the time of the law, which
<PB REF="022242_0003_0FB770561E1CE878">the Apo&s;tle urgeth in the next place, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.13. <HI>Do ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> know, that they which mini&s;ter about holy things, live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar, are partakers with the altar?</HI> God did no &s;ooner &s;eparate the <HI>Levites</HI> to the &s;ervice of the &s;anctuary, but he by law provided for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and though they were but one tribe in twelve, yet the tenth of the increa&s;e of the whole land was given to them. be&s;ides the fir&s;t fruits and offerings, and divers other advantages; &s;o that their lot might equal, yea, exceed that of their brethren. This law is now abrogated, and we pretend to no right of tithing your e&s;tates; but the equity of it can never cea&s;e; neither hath Chri&s;t left go&s;pel mini&s;ters to the wide world, but hath made pro|vi&s;ion for them al&s;o, &s;o far as the intere&s;t of his command will go with them that profe&s;s his name; for &s;o it follows <HI>v.</HI> 14. <HI>Even &s;o hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the go&s;pel, &s;hould live of the go&s;pel.</HI> The <HI>labourer</HI> is &s;till <HI>worthy</HI> of his <HI>hire,</HI> and not the <HI>le&s;s worthy,</HI> becau&s;e he <HI>labours in the go&s;pel.</HI> Though indeed (if men did fully come up to their duty, yet &s;till) the charge of go&s;pel wor&s;hip will appear very incon&s;iderable, when compared with that of the law; for were that my bu&s;ine&s;s, I think I could demon&s;trate, that the fifth part of their e&s;tates was yearly to be &s;pent in things relating to the temple &s;ervice. And if we are &s;en&s;ible of the great privilege and ble&s;&s;ing of the go&s;pel, on higher accounts than merely the ea&s;e of tho&s;e burthens, we &s;hall never think much to defray the moderate charge of a go&s;pel mi|ni&s;try, in &s;uch a manner as to give reputation to our profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Thirdly: That you may prevent the <HI>evil</HI> and <HI>inconvenience</HI> that follows the neglect of this duty, it concerns you cheerfully to practi&s;e it: I might have &s;aid, <HI>evils</HI> and <HI>inconveniencies,</HI> as of many, for many there are, and tho&s;e of ea&s;y ob&s;ervation to an unprejudiced eye; but it is the <HI>di&s;couragement of &s;tudy,</HI> which at pre&s;ent I chiefly aim at. That &s;tudy mu&s;t needs be di&s;couraged (I intend the &s;tudy of theology) by the people's neglect to make a comfortable provi&s;ion for their mini&s;ters, is too evident to re|quire a proof. Who will apply him&s;elf to gather and lay up tho&s;e &s;tores of &s;olid learning, which are needful to a mini&s;ter, when he can expect to purcha&s;e nothing to him&s;elf but poverty and di&s;tre&s;s thereby? or how &s;hall a mini&s;ter be capable to fur|ni&s;h him&s;elf with <HI>univer&s;al knowledge</HI> of things relating to this work, that hath no means for providing for his own informa|tion, or no time free from cares and worldly bu&s;ine&s;s? and the di&s;advantage of this will at la&s;t fall to the &s;hare of the people that
<PB REF="022242_0003_0FB770561E1CE878"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> admini&s;ters unto. He that con&s;iders that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> were originally written in Hebrew and Greek, mu&s;t have an hard forehead, if he deny the u&s;efulne&s;s of learning to a mini&s;ter; be&s;ides many other things there are that call for it, in reference to the opening of the &s;criptures, which I cannot now in&s;i&s;t upon. And it is not without diligent and continued &s;tudy, that the deep things of God can be &s;earched out, and &s;o propo&s;ed to you, as to enrich your mind with the clear and &s;olid knowledge of them. I confe&s;s a little learning, and le&s;s &s;tudy, may furni&s;h a man with &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e, as may plea&s;e &s;ome weak per&s;ons, that judge of a &s;ermon by the loudne&s;s of the voice, and affectionate &s;entences, or can fancy them&s;elves to be fed with the a&s;hes of jingling words, and cadency of terms in a di&s;cour&s;e. But alas! the &s;eeming warmth of affection that is &s;tirred up by &s;uch means, is as &s;hort liv'd as a land flood that hath no &s;pring to feed it. He that will do the &s;ouls of his people good, and approve him&s;elf a pa&s;tor after God's own heart, mu&s;t feed them with knowledge and under&s;tanding, and endeavour to maintain a con&s;tant zeal and affection in them, by well informing their judgments, and &s;uch an opening of the mind of God from the &s;criptures as may command their con&s;ciences&mdash;and this is not to be expected, but from him that labours in his &s;tudy, as well as in the pulpit. Mi&s;take me not; I know the &s;ucce&s;s and fruit of all the &s;tudies and labours of men that preach in the go&s;pel, is from the grace and power of the Holy Gho&s;t, but the <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;pirit</HI> is to be expected by us in the <HI>way of our duty.</HI> The&s;e things might be yet applied more home to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; but perhaps &s;ome will think there is too much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> already (though I heartily wi&s;h more were not needful) and my time calls me to put a pe|riod to this exerci&s;e.'</P>
<P>Two que&s;tions yet remain to be con&s;idered, which belong to this important &s;ubject, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In what method may this duty be di&s;charged.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To what penalty are members of churches &s;ubjected, who, though able, refu&s;e to obey this law of Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, by what method may the churches &s;upport the go&s;pel mini&s;try? an&s;wer, every church is at liberty to chu&s;e its own method. There are three methods which we beg leave to men|tion.</P>
<P N="1">1. By a <HI>voluntary &s;ub&s;cription.</HI> But it has been found by long experience that this is not the mo&s;t eligible. It is an ea&s;y thing for a man to &s;ign his name to a paper, but it has been found ex|tremely
<PB REF="022242_0004_0FB770571E5D54A8">difficult, and in many in&s;tances impo&s;&s;ible to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> money that had been &s;ub&s;cribed. Hence many mini&s;ters have contracted debts for the &s;upport of their families in confidence of the money &s;ub&s;cribed, who have been unable to pay them; and thereby their feelings and their characters have been wounded.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;econd method is by rai&s;ing a fund in the re&s;pective churches, and appropriating the annual intere&s;t of it to the maintenance of the go&s;pel mini&s;try. There are many ways by which &s;uch funds may be rai&s;ed, which will be ea&s;y to the people, viz. By weekly, monthly, or quarterly a&s;&s;ociations of the friends of religion, who may &s;pend their time at &s;uch meetings on &s;ome doctrine or practice in the churches, and at each meeting throw into a common &s;tock 1 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 2 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> more or le&s;s as they &s;hall agree among them&s;elves. However &s;mall this fund may appear at the beginning, it will in time increa&s;e &s;o much as to become a mat|ter of importance. Such per&s;ons as have it in their power may give while living, or bequeath at their death certain &s;ums depo|&s;ited in the &s;tanding fund.&mdash;Thus &s;ome of our churches to the we&s;tward &s;upport the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>A third method is by a <HI>voluntary</HI> a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment upon the e&s;tates of each member of the congregation. Let a li&s;t of property be given in to the &s;ociety, and each per&s;on's proportion of the ex|pence be a&s;certained by it; in this ca&s;e, there will be an equality, for each member of the &s;ociety will bear his part of the bur|den. Nor can we think that any but the covetous will ob|ject to it. No man in this ca&s;e will pay more than he can afford, according to his e&s;tate.</P>
<P N="2">2. To what penalty do tho&s;e members of churches &s;ubject them&s;elves, who, though able, refu&s;e to obey this law of Chri&s;t? an&s;wer, they fly in the face of divine authority; and are guilty of an act of di&s;obedience to the command of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and an act of inju&s;tice to their mini&s;ter, as ob&s;erved in the extract; therefore we believe that they ought to be dealt with as any other delinquent members. Mo&s;t certainly they walk di&s;orderly. If they loved their adorable ma&s;ter and his cau&s;e; they would not refu&s;e to &s;upport it according to their ability.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e per&s;ons who go from other &s;ocieties to &s;ave their money ought to find no protection among the Bapti&s;t churches, and we mu&s;t believe this is their motive, if they refu&s;e to pay their pro|portion of the expence of the go&s;pel among us.</P>

N. B. The times of holding the a&s;&s;ociations are mentioned; but it is to be ob&s;erved that whereas 'tis mentioned 1&s;t, 2d, 3d, 4th Saturday in &s;uch a month, it ought in many ca&s;es to be Saturday before the 1&s;t, 2d, 3d 4th Sunday in the month. The a&s;&s;ociations in the northern &s;tates are holden generally two days, but in the &s;outhern &s;tates at lea&s;t three.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters a&s;certained are all ordained, but there are as many more licen&s;ed preachers. The numbers con&s;i&s;t of members in full communion, but the adherents a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;uppo&s;ed to be four times as many, or 200,000 more.</P>
<P>This &s;tatement was principally collected in October 1789, by John A&s;plund in South+ampton, Virginia, who devotes him&s;elf entirely to travelling, in order to di&s;pence the go&s;pel, and to be acquainted with the &s;tate of the bapti&s;ts in America.
