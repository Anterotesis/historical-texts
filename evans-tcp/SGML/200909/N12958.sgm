<HEAD>To the <HI>CITIZENS</HI> of PENNSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with great reluctance I venture to claim the at|tention of my fellow citizens; nothing but nece&s;&s;ity could urge me to it at any time; but more particu|larly &s;ince it appeared probable that our enemies derived hope from &s;owing divi&s;ions among&s;t the whigs of America. Under this idea, I have patiently and &s;ilently &s;een my name held out to my country more than once, as if I had pur&s;ued a line of conduct incon|&s;i&s;tent with the general intere&s;t, altho' I knew the in&s;inu|ations to be perfectly groundle&s;s, and that it was in my power to refute them. I expected that you, my fellow-citizens, would readily di&s;cover the private rea&s;ons which produced the&s;e attacks, and, until that moment &s;hould arrive, con&s;oled my&s;elf in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innocence and integrity. But as the frequent in&s;ertion of my name in an unfavourable light may at length make &s;trong im|pre&s;&s;ions on tho&s;e who are not per&s;onally acquainted with me, I mean to give a plain narrative of &s;uch facts as re|late to the charges or in&s;inuations made again&s;t me, in as conci&s;e a manner as I am capable of. The fir&s;t that I re|member was re&s;pecting the &s;tate of my accounts with the continent, in an&s;wer to which I promi&s;ed, in a former publication, either a &s;ettlement, or a report of a commit|tee on that &s;ubject. Soon after this a very &s;erious charge of a criminal nature was brought again&s;t me in Congre&s;s. The matter was fully and minutely inve&s;tigated, and I not only proved my innocence to the perfect &s;atisfaction of that re&s;pectable body, but even my accu&s;er him&s;elf, by examining into the tran&s;action, di&s;covered a mo&s;t incon|te&s;tible proof of it, a proof that had e&s;caped me and the committee who had been appointed on that occa&s;ion: This he candidly introduced before that honourable bo|dy, which, together with their unanimous vote of acquit|tal, rendered my intended publication unnece&s;&s;ary. I then called on Congre&s;s, by letter to the Pre&s;ident, to appoint a committee for in&s;pecting the &s;tate of my ac|counts and tran&s;actions with the continent. This was readily complied with; but as I was engaged in the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly of this State, and the attention of the committee appointed occupied by a variety of other ob|jects, the matter by mutual con&s;ent was deferred. Soon after this I received advice that goods which had been de|tained in the We&s;t-Indies for about two years would be relea&s;ed, which has accordingly happened, and I am now receiving and delivering the &s;ame to the continent as fa&s;t as they arrive. This circum&s;tance gives me the pro&s;pect of being able to make a final &s;ettlement of all my accounts, which I con&s;ider as much preferable to any the mo&s;t fa|vourable report of a committee, at the &s;ame time that it gives them unnece&s;&s;ary trouble. I &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf with wi&s;hing that every per&s;on connected with public bu&s;ine&s;s had &s;uch accounts as mine to produce.</P>
<P>On the 25th of May la&s;t a Town Meeting was held in the State-Hou&s;e yard, and in the printed account of the proceedings of that day I found my name the only one mentioned as a delinquent, and a committee e&s;pecially appointed to call on me for an account of my connection with a cargoe then lately arrived in this port. I was very unwell at the time, but the committee called on me in a day or two, when I readily gave them every &s;atisfaction in my power. They treated me with complai&s;ance, and ap|peared &s;atisfied; indeed I have been told &s;ince, that one of the gentlemen declared they were &s;o. As they did not call on me again, I wrote them a letter the 26th of June, when the complaint in my eyes began to abate a little, in|tending then to &s;end it: but on being told they &s;till in|tended calling, I withheld it until this time, and I here in&s;ert a copy, as containing the &s;tate of that tran&s;action.</P>

<SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When you did me the honour to call on me about a month ago, agreeable to your appointment by the Town-Meeting held in the State-Hou&s;e yard the 25th of May, you found me afflicted with an inflammation in one of my eyes, that had for ten days preceding rendered me almo&s;t incapable of bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;uch has been my &s;ituation from that time to this, or you &s;hould &s;ooner have heard from me, altho' I think it was intimated at parting, by Mr. Smith and Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, that I was to hear from you again in a few days. It may not be ami&s;s to mention that, after you had &s;ignified the bu&s;ine&s;s you came on, I ob&s;erv|ed that by a publication in that day a paper of the tran&s;ac|tions at the State-Hou&s;e yard, it appeared I was to give my an&s;wers in writing, and therefore reque&s;ted that your que&s;tions might al&s;o be written. Mr. Matlack &s;aid, the committee, being entirely ignorant of the tran&s;actions re|lating to the French polacre's cargoe, wi&s;hed me to give a general relation of the matter, to enable them to judge whether it was nece&s;&s;ary to propo&s;e any and what que|&s;tions to me, or whether a general relation of my know|ledge on the &s;ubject might not be &s;ufficient. I replied, that I &s;hould cheerfully gratify the committee, having done nothing that I was either afraid or a&s;hamed to have known. Ob&s;erving, that I con&s;idered this among&s;t the number of tho&s;e unmerited and groundle&s;s attacks which I had been u&s;ed to of late, and which I expected would, like the re&s;t, end to my honour, rather than di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>I then a&s;&s;ured the committee, and now repeat it, that I never moved hand, foot or tongue, to procure the car|goe in que&s;tion, that I had not &s;ought after it my&s;elf, nor employed any other to do it for me. It was many days in this port before I had the lea&s;t idea of a connection with it, and when it did come into my view, it was upon the application of other people to me. I &s;uppo&s;e it is a well known fact, that many per&s;ons wanted to get this cargoe, by purcha&s;e or otherways, into their hands; more than one reque&s;ted me to join them, being particularly induced thereto from a knowledge that I could &s;upply the &s;hip with the cargoe wanted for her return voyage. A|mong&s;t the re&s;t a gentleman, &s;ettled in a neighbouring State, a countryman of the &s;uper-cargoes, happening to be here at the time, had influence enough to obtain a pre|ference of this much &s;ought for cargoe. This gentleman came and offered me a &s;hare in the purcha&s;e, agreed to put it entirely under my management, and that I &s;hould draw a commi&s;&s;ion on the &s;ales, provided I would &s;upply an outward cargoe for the &s;hip. The&s;e offers were gene|rous, and fairly within the line of my bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as I pre&s;ume no merchant of ability to perform the engage|ment would have refu&s;ed. But I in&s;i&s;ted, that if a pur|cha&s;e was made, and I to be intere&s;ted, it &s;hould be on &s;uch terms as would admit me to &s;ell rea&s;onably, and leave the concerned a moderate profit.</P>
<P>The gentleman de&s;ired the extent of my terms, which I gave, and as I thought in &s;uch clear and explicit terms as did not admit of mi&s;take. After &s;ome little time a bar|gain was concluded, and reduced to writing the 3d of May. This writing is in the French language, which I do not under&s;tand, but being told it was nearly conformable to my terms, I con&s;ented to receive the cargoe. The fir&s;t thing I did was to &s;end for tho&s;e agents who purcha&s;e for the continent, and offer them whatever was wanted for the army on &s;uch terms as they declared very moderate. I gave them the invoice to pick out what they cho&s;e, and they culled about one fourth the value of the whole, but entirely in articles the mo&s;t &s;aleable of any in the &s;hip. Before the whole of the&s;e goods were delivered I had a tran&s;lation of the agreement, and di&s;covered that the par|ties had not under&s;tood each other. I therefore &s;topped all further proceedings, and got them together for expla|nation, when it clearly appeared that my intentions had not been complied with, and that I had not under&s;tood the bargain in the &s;ame light the con&s;ignees did, for I had &s;old to the public much cheaper than, by their idea of the bargain, they had &s;old to the gentleman that contracted with them. Upon full conviction of this, and that the mi&s;under&s;tanding was owing to my want of French, and the other gentleman's bad Engli&s;h, they very honourably agreed to render the bargain void.</P>
<P>After this Me&s;&s;. La Caze and Mallet, the &s;upercargoes, a&s;ked me to undertake the &s;ale of their cargoe as a factor, for it was not probable that they, who were entire &s;tran|gers in the country, could manage it properly them&s;elves. I told them, if they would ratify the &s;ales I had made to the public, I would accept their propo&s;al, which they agreed to, and by this means the continent had the public &s;upplies out of this cargoe very con&s;iderably cheaper than could have happened in any other way; for had the purcha&s;e fir&s;t made been clearly under&s;tood, the agents mu&s;t have paid twenty prices higher, or if I had acted from the fir&s;t as a factor to the &s;upercargoes, I mu&s;t have &s;old, as I af|terwards did, under their direction, and to their be&s;t ad|vantage. My agreement to become their factor is dated the 11th May, as you &s;aw, for I &s;hewed you the original of this, and a tran&s;lation of the other agreement. I be|lieve the bargain was verbally made a day or two before, and from that time I proceeded in the &s;ales, in &s;uch a manner as I judged mo&s;t likely to give my employers that &s;atisfaction they were entitled to. Their cargoe being bought dear, the advance on the invoice has not been &s;o high as on others, the &s;aleable articles were &s;oon run off, whil&s;t a great many, un&s;uited to this &s;ea&s;on and this country, remain on hand&punc; This la&s;t circum&s;tance not &s;uiting the plans and hopes of the &s;upercargoes, they made me new propo&s;als, but it is immaterial to the pub|lic whether I accept the&s;e or not, as an agreement, after the bulk of the cargoe was &s;old, could not affect &s;uch &s;ales, and what remains, be&s;ides being un&s;aleable, will be as &s;ubject to regulation as any other imported goods are. After giving you this ju&s;t &s;tate of my connection with a cargoe that has made &s;o much noi&s;e, I think you will not he&s;itate to do ju&s;tice to my conduct, if it appears to you in the &s;ame light it does to every per&s;on with whom I have conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject. And as Mr. Matlack in|timated that it might not be ami&s;s to give the committee information of the original proprietors of this cargoe, I &s;hall &s;end herewith Me&s;&s;. LaCaze and Mallet's declaration on that point, al&s;o their certificate that I have truly re|lated my connection with their cargoe.</P>

<P>This letter contains the &s;tate of that tran&s;action, and I &s;ubmit it to con&s;ideration whether my conduct therein merited cen&s;ure, or de&s;erved to have my name held out in the light it was. The next attack <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I omit to notice here a piece which cla&s;&s;es me with &s;ome other gentlemen as having influenced the re&s;entment of Col. White and Mr. Hooper again&s;t Mr. Serjeant, Attorney-Ge|neral of this State, becau&s;e I do not think the author of that piece &s;eriou&s;ly believes any of us capable of &s;uch conduct. Be&s;ides that I &s;uppo&s;e Col. White and Mr. Hooper too inde|pendent of &s;pirit to be &s;o influenced; and I &s;hall only &s;ay, if that were not the ca&s;e and I had any preten&s;ions to influence them, I never had any difference with Mr. Serjeant, nor the lea&s;t de&s;ire to do him an injury or ill office.</NOTE> on me was made by republi&s;hing in Mr. Dunlap's Packet of the 3d of June, a piece &s;aid to be taken from Rivington's paper, entitled, Memoir in an&s;wer to the ob&s;ervations of M. de la Fere on the bills of Congre&s;s, &amp;c. dated Edenton, N. Carolina, Jan. 18, 1778, and for the &s;atisfaction of my readers I will here recite the paragraph in which I am mentioned. <Q>Few are convinced by the a&s;&s;urances of Congre&s;s that paper is equal in value to gold, a&s;&s;ertions that rea&s;on and fact deny, and their own members do every thing in their power to confute. Mr. Robert Morris in particular has dared to offer to a per&s;on of my acquaintance, bills of exchange upon France at the rate of 13 &s;ols and &s;ome deniers for a Continental dollar.</Q> Who the author of this may be I know not; &s;till le&s;s his informant; but either the former has been guilty of gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation, or the latter of direct fal&s;hood. In January 1778 I had no bills to &s;ell, nor offered any to &s;ale. I paid two bills on France in March 1778 for the ballance of an account at the rate of ex|change that was current when the money came into my hands, and rebought the&s;e bills in April or May follow|ing at 400 per cent, which was then the highe&s;t cour&s;e of exchange. The per&s;on with whom I had this tran&s;action now re&s;ides in Philadelphia, and ready to prove the fact. Can it then be believed by any body that I &s;hould in Ja|nuary, 1778, a&s;k a dollar for thirteen &s;ols and &s;ome de|niers of France, which is equal to an exchange of 1200 or 1300 per cet. If it be &s;aid the date is mi&s;printed, and that it &s;hould be January, 1779, I an&s;wer that I cea&s;ed to be a Member of Congre&s;s in October, 1778. In January, 1779. I &s;old bills as a factor, the highe&s;t exchange obtained was 900 per cent. and it never was my practice to a&s;k 300 or 400 per cent. more then the current price, though I might perhaps produce examples in ju&s;tification of &s;uch practices, from a quarter not &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>If this writer meant to include me in the pa&s;&s;age follow|ing that I have quoted, he intended me equal inju&s;tice, for I never &s;old to the public any goods but what I im|ported, nor purcha&s;ed any produce of the country but for exportation.</P>
<P>On the 17th June I was much &s;urpri&s;ed at the receipt of the following note:</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your letter to Captain Hey&s;ham of ye&s;terday's date was this morning laid before the committee, who are &s;orry your indi&s;po&s;ition confines you &s;o long, and will with &s;atisfaction excu&s;e your per&s;onal attendance: In con&s;equence have directed me to write you notice there|of; &s;ame time I am ordered to reque&s;t you will lay before this committee at ten o'clock to-morrow forenoon, or &s;ooner if convenient, the original in&s;tructions or agree|ments by virtue whereof you are purcha&s;ing for his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's agent, an account of the quantities &s;o purcha&s;ed and contracted for, and information by what conveyance and to what places or &s;tores &s;aid flour is col|lected, and from what places in the country it has been and is now brought.</P>
<P>The Committee con&s;ider it their duty to communi|cate to you the information which nece&s;&s;itates them to make this reque&s;t, and doubt not but you will judge it a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for their conduct, viz. Alexander Wil&s;on, of Earl town&s;hip, Lanca&s;ter county, reports, that you, through Matthias Slough of Lanca&s;ter, give 22<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR> per hundred for flour there, and on oath de|clares he delivered you ten barrels ye&s;terday, which he received, by order of Matthias Slough, at Whiteman's mill, Earl town&s;hip, afore&s;aid; and further, that he &s;aw Mr. Slough agree with a man at Lanca&s;ter for a quantity of flour at the rate of &s;ixty dollars per hundred. The Committee perceive how this counteracts the re&s;olves of the late town meeting, more e&s;pecially as the&s;e purcha&s;es are made &s;o nigh the city, and mu&s;t enhance the price greatly in con&s;equence of the waggon hire, exclu&s;ive of a &s;u&s;picion which prevails concerning Continental teams being employed in that &s;ervice.</P>

<P>I am honoured with a letter from your Secretary pro tempore, Mr. Alexander Boyd, excu&s;ing my per&s;onal attendance on the Committee, but reque&s;ting me to lay before you at ten o'clock to-morrow forenoon or &s;ooner if convenient, <Q>the original in&s;tructions or agreements by virtue whereof I am purcha&s;ing for his Mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian Maje&s;ty's Agent; an account of the quantity &s;o purcha&s;ed and contracted for, and information by what conveyance and to what places or &s;tores the &s;aid flour

is collected, and from what places in the country it has been brought.</Q> On the receipt of this letter I thought it my duty to communicate the &s;ame to my em|ployer, which I did immediately, with Captain Hey&s;ham's note of ye&s;terday and my an&s;wer. Mr. Holker, his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's Agent in this bu&s;ine&s;s, does not think it proper for me to communicate the things you require, and therefore I am under a nece&s;&s;ity of referring you to him for &s;uch further information as you may wi&s;h. For my part I am very willing as your fellow citizen to give you, and through you, the public at large, every &s;atis|faction in my power, becau&s;e I am de&s;irous of retaining that good opinion I know my conduct de&s;erves; and upon this principle I venture to a&s;&s;ure you, the orders to Mr. Slough for purcha&s;ing flour were dated the 27th of January, and confirmed the 17th of February la&s;t. He was applied to in preference to any other per&s;on in that county, becau&s;e he was already a purcha&s;er for the continent, which prevented any rai&s;ing of prices by contention, as might have happened had another agent been employed. He was limit|ed not to exceed the prices given by the continent, and de|&s;ired either to hire public or private teams as he found the tran&s;portation might be effected cheape&s;t. All the letters I have written to him on the &s;ubject &s;ince tho&s;e dates, were only to exhort him to a &s;peedy and full execution of the order. No other purcha&s;e has been made in this &s;tate except in this city under my immediate in&s;pection, con|formable to verbal orders from my principal from day to day, and this before the meeting in the State-hou&s;e yard. The quantity on hand here is incon&s;iderable, and I pre|&s;ume you do not wi&s;h to interfere in what is done in the neighbouring &s;tates. Before I clo&s;e this letter I can|not omit mentioning that four or five poor women with &s;acks under their arms came to me this morning demand|ing &s;upplies of flour, alledging they were directed to me by the committee for that purpo&s;e, and informed by them that I had received two waggon loads of flour from the country ye&s;terday I confe&s;s this &s;urpri&s;ed me a good deal at fir&s;t, but on reflecting a little it &s;eems highly improbable the committee or any of the members could be capable of giving &s;uch directions, becau&s;e &s;ome of them had before been informed by my clerks that the flour under my care belonged to his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty, and my letter to Captain Hey&s;ham ye&s;terday con|firmed it; con&s;equently it mu&s;t be known, I could not deliver it to any per&s;on but by order of my employers; and I have too good an opinion of your candour to think you would &s;end tho&s;e people where they mu&s;t of nece&s;|&s;ity meet a refu&s;al, although that very refu&s;al might rai&s;e prejudices again&s;t me.</P>

<P>The inclo&s;ed is a re&s;olution of this day, and is found|ed on evidence which appears to be inconte&s;tible. We con&s;ider the intere&s;t of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, who&s;e &s;ervice you act in, as unnece&s;&s;arily &s;uffering, by giving greater prices than there are occa&s;ion for, and in his be|half, as well as for the purpo&s;e of appreciating our own currency, we can no longer be &s;ilent &s;pectators of prac|tices which tend to the injury of both.</P>
<P>The Committee, from a point of politene&s;s, have inclo&s;ed their re&s;olve to you, prior to its appearance in the papers, which will be to-morrow, and &s;hall be glad to confer with you on the &s;ubject at any time and place you may plea&s;e to appoint. An exact copy of this, with the re&s;olve, is &s;ent to Mr. Holker.</P>

<P>Whereas a quantity of flour has been purcha&s;ed by Jonathan Rum&s;ord, junior, of the State of Delaware, under the direction of Mr. Holker, Con&s;ul and Agent General of the marine of France, and Mr. Robert Mor|ris, merchant, of the city of Philadelphia: And whereas the price given for the &s;aid flour exceeds the regulated market price, and thereby tends to depreciate the cur|rency of this country, as well as to put our good allies to an unnece&s;&s;ary expence, both of purcha&s;e and increa&s;ed commi&s;&s;ions:</P>
<P>And whereas it is our intention and determination to &s;upport the intere&s;t of our allies, as well as the cur|rency of our country, and to pre&s;erve the former from impo&s;ition and the latter from depreciation, and in all ca&s;es to do as we would be done by:</P>
<P>Therefore Re&s;olved, That the afore&s;aid flour be de|tained under the care of the committee, and that Mr. Holker and Mr. Morris be properly notified thereof, in order that &s;uch mea&s;ures may be taken as the ca&s;e may require.</P>
<P>That the thanks of this Committee be given to the Committee of Wilmington, for their information and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance re&s;pecting the above, and that we hold our&s;elves accountable to them for one hundred and eighty-two barrels received.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter and the re&s;olution having po&s;itively con|demned Mr. Holker and my&s;elf, without hearing us, I could not think it proper to wait on the Committee after judgment was pronounced, and therefore wrote Mr. Hen|ry a note in the&s;e words:</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have received your favour of this day, inclo&s;ing a re&s;olution of the Committee re&s;pecting the flour pur|cha&s;ed in Wilmington by directions of the Honourable Mr. Holker, and cannot help regretting that the Com|mittee did not think proper to propo&s;e a conference on the &s;ubject, before they went &s;o far in cen&s;uring the con|duct of per&s;ons by no means oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e de&s;irable objects, "appreciating the continental currency, and lowering the prices of commodities."</P>
<P>I &s;hould mo&s;t cheerfully have waited on you, and given the information which I think you ought to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of before &s;uch a re&s;olve was pa&s;&s;ed. But the reflections in your letter and that re&s;olution being en|tirely unde&s;erved, I have no doubt of being able effectually to ju&s;tify my&s;elf to the public. I thank you and the Com|mittee for communicating the intended publication, and remain. Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your obedient humble Servant, <HI>ROBERT MORRIS. </HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that I tell the Committee I &s;hould mo&s;t cheerfully have waited on them, and given that in|formation I thought they ought to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of before &s;uch a re&s;olve was pa&s;&s;ed. In this I meant only information as to my&s;elf, and the part I had acted in the bu&s;ine&s;s; for Mr. Holker deems it incon&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of his Royal Ma&s;ter to account for his conduct, as Agent, to any authority not derived from his Maje&s;ty, except in &s;uch matters as are connected with Congre&s;s, or the Government of a State. On conver&s;ing with this gentleman on the proceedings of the Committee, he laid before me the copy of his an&s;wer to Mr. Henry's letter to him, and has given me leave to publi&s;h it. As it con|tains a full exculpation of my conduct, I &s;hall do &s;o. It is in the&s;e words:</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I only act in any of the United States of North-Ame|rica in my capacity of Agent-General of the Royal Ma|rine, under the authority and &s;anction of Congre&s;s, I had therefore this morning the honour of informing them of the tran&s;action of the Committee of Wilmington, and of the arrival of the flour to this city. I re&s;pect your mo|tives, but as I am not a competent judge of the means you employ to accompli&s;h your wi&s;hes, I mu&s;t refer you to Congre&s;s, to whom alone his Maje&s;ty's Repre&s;entatives or Agents can give any account of their actions. Therefore I can only thank you for your politene&s;s and attention on this occa&s;ion. I ob&s;erve with &s;urprize that you have &s;ent a copy of your letter to Mr. Robert Morris, with one of the re&s;olves of the Committee. This mu&s;t have given you unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, as I am alone accountable for the purcha&s;e of this flour, he having only acted in con&s;e|quence of my expre&s;s orders and directions. I am, Sir,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Had the Commitee thought proper to con&s;ult me before they pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e ha&s;ty re&s;olutions, in the preamble to which they not only imply a cen&s;ure of us, as depreciators of the continental money, but in&s;inuate that it is done for the &s;ake of encrea&s;ing the commi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould have &s;hewn them that I had nothing more to do in that parti|cular affair than to receive and examine the invoices, and pay for the flour agreeable to order. This being really the ca&s;e, Mr. Holker would have declared it under his hand then as readily as he has done &s;ince, not being afraid to abide the con&s;equences of his own conduct; and &s;urely under &s;uch information, the Committee would not have uttered the&s;e cen&s;ures again&s;t me. I would have gone far|ther, and informed them, that from the fir&s;t moment I agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. Holker in the bu&s;ine&s;s of his agency, my advice to him was to draw the &s;upplies of provi&s;ions wanted for the fleet from the Continental Commi&s;&s;aries, rather than purcha&s;e them him&s;elf, alledging that flour was &s;carce, the price not only high but likely to ri&s;e; that if he, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, employed one &s;et of pur|cha&s;ers, and the continent another, competition would probably take place between them, the prices ri&s;e rapidly, and the blame mo&s;t likely be thrown on him or his Agents. This advice was adopted; Congre&s;s were applied to, and orders procured for the Commi&s;&s;aries to grant the nece&s;&s;a|ry &s;upplies. I would a&s;k whether this advice &s;avours of a de&s;ire to increa&s;e commi&s;&s;ions, or implies any practices &s;uch as the Committee can be no longer &s;ilent &s;pectators of.</P>
<P>Mr. Holker continued to depend on commi&s;&s;arial &s;up|plies until repeated di&s;appointments from almo&s;t every quarter made him exceedingly unea&s;y, and he judged it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make purcha&s;es him&s;elf. My advice was &s;till either to employ the Continental Purcha&s;ing Com|mi&s;&s;aries, or per&s;ons of &s;uch character as might be depend|ed on for prudent good management: This was agreed to, and pur&s;ued in every in&s;tance, Congre&s;s, or the Committee of Congre&s;s for the Commi&s;&s;ary department, being privy to all the mea&s;ures adopted: and we have never heard the charge of rai&s;ing prices until now. Mr. Holker is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ample materials to &s;upport his tran&s;actions whenever he &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary or proper to do &s;o. The Com|mittee &s;eem to have con&s;idered their regulated price of 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per hundred for flour as having extended to Wilming|ton, which is in another government; and it appears they mu&s;t be right, &s;ince the Committee of that place have agreed to act &s;ubordinately to them. Mr. Rumford, who bought the flour, I &s;uppo&s;e had not conceived it in that light, or probably he would not have made the purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>In Mr. Henry's letter to me it is &s;aid, "We con&s;ider the intere&s;t of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tiain Maje&s;ty, who&s;e &s;ervice you act in, as unnece&s;&s;arily &s;uffering, by giving greater prices than there are occa&s;ion for." Certainly the Com|mittee will perceive that they gave too ha&s;ty an a&s;&s;ent to this paragraph, for they &s;urely will not pretend to deter|mine how &s;peedily the exigencies of public affairs may have required the &s;upply in que&s;tion; and they cannot but recollect that the regulation of the price of flour did in the fir&s;t in&s;tance create a &s;carcity, which induced an applica|tion from them to the Committee of Congre&s;s for 100 bar|rels of flour to &s;erve out to the citizens, as they could not get &s;upplied otherwi&s;e at the regulated price.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me that the in&s;inuation conveyed by the words, increa&s;ed commi&s;&s;ion, ought not to have been ha|zarded again&s;t a merchant of reputation without the fulle&s;t evidence, as coming from a public body, who will always be more under the re&s;traints of decorum than is perhaps incumbent on every individual. I &s;hall notice it, but with that decency of language and &s;entiment which it is my duty to my&s;elf to make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>A merchant doubtle&s;s has it always in view to increa&s;e his commi&s;&s;ions, but he mu&s;t know very little of bu&s;ine&s;s indeed, who thinks to do that by rai&s;ing the price of the commodities his employer deals in, for in this he certainly drives him to employ another Factor or &s;eek a cheaper market, &s;o that he would inevitably fall the victim of his own rapacity. Several gentlemen of the Committee mu&s;t know that I was many years in the receipt of much larger and more exten&s;ive commi&s;&s;ions for the purcha&s;e of pro|duce than at pre&s;ent, and as that bu&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ed on my hands until the exports from this country were &s;topped, it is evident that my employers were hone&s;tly and faithfully &s;erved. Why then &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed I would &s;ud|denly depart from my former practice and principles, and &s;acrifice the intere&s;t of my employer for&mdash;for what? For the increa&s;e of my property by a trifling commi&s;&s;ion, which, gained on &s;uch terms, would nece&s;&s;arily reduce the value of my whole fortune, a con&s;iderable part of which is in Continental paper, and of con&s;equence, however &s;ome men may circulate for their own purpo&s;es that I am a de|preciator of it, my own private intere&s;t would of it&s;elf lead me, were I deficient in better motives, to exert my&s;elf as I always have done to &s;upport and rai&s;e its value. I have called the proceedings of the Committee on this &s;ubject ha&s;ty, they certainly were &s;o, and I am confident they will think their cen&s;ures are unde&s;erved when they have can|didly con&s;idered what I have &s;aid.</P>
<P>I am really at a lo&s;s to conceive why my name &s;hould, without &s;ufficient grounds, be &s;o frequently mentioned in the public papers, and held in &s;uch an odious point of view. It cannot ari&s;e from any doubts of my attachment to the general cau&s;e of America, my exertions from the fir&s;t promulgation of the &s;tamp act to this day do not leave room for a &s;ingle &s;u&s;picion, e&s;pecially as tho&s;e exer|tions were greate&s;t when our affairs were at the wor&s;t. It cannot ju&s;tly ari&s;e from any part of my conduct as a private citizen; for near twenty years I was engaged in a very great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of bu&s;ine&s;s, and extended the commerce of this port to places little known to you before my time. This increa&s;ed the demand for your produce, rai&s;ed the value of your lands, encouraged your indu&s;try, and re|warded your labours. I imported thou&s;ands of good &s;et|tlers into Penn&s;ylvania, after that bu&s;ine&s;s had ruined al|mo&s;t all that went before me in it.</P>
<P>With plea&s;ure I can now look round me, and &s;ee among&s;t my fellow citizens &s;ome who&s;e fortunes I have made; many for whom I laid the foundation of their pre|&s;ent importance; hundreds who&s;e circum&s;tances I have bettered, and thou&s;ands to who&s;e maintenance I have contributed. A&s;k tho&s;e that deal with me, whether I am generous, open, and deci&s;ive in my dealing; a&s;k the nu|merous trade&s;men I have employed and do employ, whe|ther I pay them punctually and chearfully; a&s;k that u&s;e|ful body of men who follow the &s;ea, whether I have not been their con&s;tant friend and benefactor, whenever it was in my power; and a&s;k the hone&s;t labourer whether I have ever &s;queezed a pittance from his hard &s;ervice. It gives me pain to mention the&s;e things. It is not from a di&s;po&s;ition to boa&s;t my own prai&s;es, but a &s;incere and ho|ne&s;t de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o much of your e&s;teem as I know my&s;elf to de&s;erve; and certainly the pre&s;ent committee ought not to con&s;ider me as an enemy, for I have not only &s;old my goods agreeable to their regulations, but have advi&s;ed others to comply with them.</P>
<P>My mercantile character cannot have given ju&s;t cau&s;e for the attacks made on me, for I have con&s;tantly &s;old off my cargoes as they arrived; and to con&s;ider me as a depreciator of the Continental Money, and at the &s;ame time as the holder of very con&s;iderable &s;ums of it, is too ab&s;urd to de&s;erve refutation.&mdash;However, I mu&s;t add, that I have always paid too much re&s;pect to the credit of the paper money for my own intere&s;t. For by making pur|cha&s;es of bills of exchange, lands, &amp;c. at prices that now would appear nothing, I might have ama&s;&s;ed no incon|&s;iderable fortune. In&s;tead of doing the&s;e things, I have freely and liberally &s;taked my property in the export and import trade with various &s;ucce&s;s, frequently meeting with &s;o many and &s;uch heavy lo&s;&s;es as would have deter|red a le&s;s re&s;olute trader from continuing the pur&s;uit. The in&s;tances of my &s;ucce&s;s I need not mention, for the&s;e are counted up by lookers on in a ten-fold propor|tion.</P>
<P>This I know, that there are people who have made much more without ri&s;quing a &s;hilling, and by the few &s;mall land purcha&s;es I have made, I have learnt that in that way alone I might have been a greater gainer, with infinitely le&s;s trouble and without any ri&s;que.</P>
<P>My enemies at <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;eem pretty numerous, and they are &s;uch on improper motives; for I declare that I am not con&s;cious of having given any man ju&s;t cau&s;e for being &s;o.</P>
<P>If the di&s;gu&s;t of any part of my fellow citizens proceeds from my oppo&s;ition to the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of Penn|&s;ylvania, &s;urely when they come to con&s;ider, that a free|dom of opinion on &s;uch &s;ubjects is e&s;&s;ential to a free go|vernment, and that to act in conformity with our opini|ons where the object is public good is the duty of a good man, they will pardon endeavours which were well meant, even if founded in error, and in their own zeal on the one &s;ide, find a rea&s;onable apology for mine on the other. For I will not &s;uppo&s;e they have been actuated by private views, becau&s;e I feel nothing in my own bo|&s;om to ju&s;tify the &s;u&s;picion of others. My conduct in promoting mea&s;ures for re-con&s;idering the con&s;titution was by tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed me acknowledged to be can|did, open and liberal; I never was guilty of per&s;onal abu&s;e, nor had I any per&s;onalities in view. I neither wanted or would accept any offer my&s;elf, nor had I any connections to provide for.</P>
<P>My &s;ole object was to obtain &s;uch a Con&s;titution as would in my opinion an&s;wer the ends of good government; and it was to me a matter of indifference what men were in the &s;eats of authority, if &s;ufficient &s;ecurity were provid|ed for the liberty, life and property of individuals. I am very de&s;irous of being only a private man, and when I became otherwi&s;e, it was in obedience to a &s;entiment I had adopted, that in times of di&s;tre&s;s it was the duty of a good citizen to act in whatever &s;tation his country might call him to, and &s;o far am I from courting the continuance of public employment, that I &s;hall with the greate&s;t plea|&s;ure re&s;ign that which I now hold to &s;uch worthier hands as you, my fellow-citizens may appoint. While I was your &s;ervant it was my pride to &s;erve you faithfully, to &s;erve you chearfully; I have done &s;o near four years, and made as great &s;acrifices of private intere&s;t as any man among you. I made them with alacrity. I had and &s;till re|tain a proper &s;en&s;e of the honour of &s;acrificing my proper|ty, my labour and my ea&s;e, to the voice of my country. In your applau&s;e I &s;hall at all times feel my&s;elf over-paid, and if I mi&s;s of that reward, I &s;hall con&s;ole my&s;elf with an approving con&s;cience; and I &s;hall at all times be ready to give my tribute of prai&s;e to tho&s;e more fortunate men, who with greater abilities or better opportunities may have rendered you more e&s;&s;ential or more agreeable &s;ervices.</P>
