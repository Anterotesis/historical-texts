<P>Which of <HI>you</HI> all are more <HI>likely</HI> or <HI>worthy</HI> to live than the <HI>Decea&s;ed Child was?</HI> Where is there any One among you <HI>fairer</HI> in Body or in Mind? Which of you have a fairer <HI>pro&s;pect</HI> for this World than

<P>A <HI>Praying</HI> Child is, I hope, a <HI>Gracious</HI> One. <HI>Children,</HI> do you <HI>Pray</HI> to GOD daily for your Precious and Immortal Souls? Will you not be put upon doing &s;o by this Example? May you not die &s;o <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> as not to have <HI>time</HI> to pray at la&s;t?

<P>For Death is come up into our Windows, and is entred into our Palaces, to cut off the Children from with|out, and the Young men from the Streets.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HOW often doth the <HI>Great GOD</HI> re|peat His <HI>Calls</HI> to us to look into our <HI>Graves!</HI> and how &s;ea&s;onable is this <HI>Melancholly Subject</HI> ever to us thro' our whole Life! The <HI>affect|ing Strokes</HI> of His Providence return <HI>&s;urprizingly</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="001671_0009_0FB4E27CEFD9BD98">upon us, every now and then, as the <HI>Clouds after the Rain.</HI></P>
<P>We have had a <HI>dark</HI> and &s;orrowful <HI>long Winter</HI> by rea&s;on of the <HI>&V;ntimely Deaths</HI> (as we are rea|dy to &s;ay) of many of our <HI>dear Children,</HI> and hopeful <HI>Young People.</HI> And now this <HI>last Week</HI> a very <HI>&s;udden awful Death</HI> has taken away <HI>One of the fairest Flowers in this Garden of GOD;</HI> One of the mo&s;t <HI>Blooming and Lovely</HI> Children in the <HI>Town</HI> or <HI>Land,</HI> whether we &s;peak of <HI>Body or Mind.</HI></P>
<P>I wou'd take <HI>this Occa&s;ion</HI> therefore, for the profit both of <HI>Elder</HI> and <HI>Younger</HI> Per&s;ons, to recol|lect the <HI>Contemplations</HI> which I have &s;ometimes had on the <HI>Meaning of Divine Providence,</HI> in &s;uch grie|vous di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Context</HI> is one of the mo&s;t <HI>mournful Chapters</HI> that you can find in all the <HI>Holy Scripture. Jere|miah,</HI> the <HI>Weeping Prophet,</HI> does in the mo&s;t <HI>pathe|tical</HI> words that <HI>Art</HI> can chu&s;e and lay together, excite Him&s;elf and others unto <HI>Holy Sorrow</HI> on the fore&s;ight of the Calamities coming upon <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> by the conquering and cruel <HI>Arms</HI> of the King of <HI>Babylon.</HI> He wi&s;hes that <HI>his own Head were Waters, and his Eyes a fountain of Tears, that he might weep day and night, for the &s;lain of the Daughter of his People.</HI> He <HI>weeps</HI> for their <HI>Sins,</HI> which he therefore Enumerates; and then He weeps <HI>afre&s;h</HI> over the pro&s;pect of GOD's <HI>Judgments,</HI> the &s;or|rowful Fruit, and dreadful Puni&s;hment of their Sins: in which he mu&s;t be a <HI>Stock</HI> rather than a
<PB N="3" REF="001671_0010_0FB4E27E3B39DD80"><HI>Man,</HI> who is not affected with the <HI>Hand and An|ger of</HI> Divine Providence.</P>
<P>This was the <HI>bitter Mourning</HI> in the <HI>Context:</HI> v. 15. <HI>Therefore thus &s;aith the LORD of Hosts, the GOD of I&s;rael; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with Wormwood, and give them water of Gall to drink.</HI> v. 17. <HI>Con&s;ider ye, and call for the mourn|ing Women, that they may come,&mdash;and let them make haste, and take up a Wailing for us; that our Eyes may run down with tears, and our eye-lids gu&s;h out with waters: for a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion! How are we &s;poiled! &mdash;Hear&mdash;O ye Women,&mdash; and teach your Daughters wailing, and every one her Neighbour Lamentation: for Death is come up into our Windows, and is entred into our Palaces; to cut off the Children from without, and the Young men from the Streets.</HI></P>
<P>What can be more <HI>&s;oft, pa&s;&s;ionate and moving,</HI> than the <HI>strain</HI> of the Context? and what <HI>wound up</HI> the &s;trings of &s;orrow unto this <HI>High Note,</HI> but Death come into their Windows, to cut off the Children and Young people from the Streets! Well does the <HI>Prophet</HI> call for the <HI>tenderest hearts,</HI> and the <HI>&s;hrillest voices,</HI> even of <HI>Women,</HI> to rai&s;e the Lamentation on this account.</P>
<P>All Divine <HI>Judgments</HI> call for our <HI>Sorrowing</HI> un|der Gods Hand and Rod. While God <HI>distribu|teth &s;orrows in his Anger,</HI> our Eyes &s;hould <HI>pour out tears</HI> unto God. We ought to <HI>weep</HI> with him that is in <HI>Trouble,</HI> and our <HI>Eyes &s;hould mourn</HI> by rea&s;on
<PB N="4" REF="001671_0011_0FB4E281DE413D40">of affliction. But in no <HI>Instance</HI> does <HI>Nature</HI> teach &amp; even force &s;orrow, more than in <HI>Bereave|ments</HI> and the Death of Children: This was the voice in <HI>Rama, Rachel weeping for her Children, and would not be comforted,</HI> &amp;c. It was &s;aid of <HI>Ma|ry, &s;he goeth to the Grave to weep there;</HI> a Melan|cholly place indeed to draw forth the Tears of Relations.</P>
<P>But I'm aware that many may be <HI>too apt</HI> of them&s;elves to <HI>indulge Grief.</HI> I will forbear there|fore to Enlarge any further on the <HI>Context.</HI> Death is come up into our <HI>Windows: &s;cil.</HI> of the Chambers where the Sick lay. There's no lock|ing our Doors again&s;t this <HI>Officer,</HI> when he comes to Arre&s;t, or &s;erve his Execution. Or rather, as a <HI>Thief</HI> in the Night <HI>Steals in</HI> at the Window, &s;o does Death often &s;teal as <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> into our Hou|&s;es, ere we are aware. Nor does it enter into the <HI>Cottages of the Poor</HI> only, but into the Hou&s;es of the Rich, the Dwellings of Rulers, and the <HI>Pala|ces of Princes.</HI> But that which I &s;hall only attend to is, that it &s;pares not the <HI>tender plea&s;ant Children,</HI> nor the hail and <HI>promi&s;ing Youths;</HI> The&s;e, a mo&s;t &s;ad part of its Execution, it <HI>cuts off from the Streets&punc;</HI> The <HI>Streets,</HI> where the Young people were wont to <HI>Walk,</HI> and where the Children us'd to <HI>Play.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI> that I &s;hall rai&s;e from the Words, is this:</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<PB N="5" REF="001671_0012_0FB4E2839A7400D0">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That abundance of the Children of Men, and of our mo&s;t hopeful, pious and promi&s;ing Children do Die Young.</HEAD>
<P>A very <HI>plain,</HI> and <HI>poor, little Ob&s;ervation</HI> you'll be ready to &s;ay; what any <HI>Child</HI> may make, and I would pray <HI>them</HI> to do &s;o. I'm &s;ure, you don't think that I intend to labour in the <HI>proof</HI> of this obvious <HI>Truth,</HI> and Univer&s;al Experience of Mankind. There is great <HI>Inequality</HI> as to the length of peoples lives here in the Body, tho' at the <HI>longest</HI> the life of man is very <HI>&s;hort;</HI> as a Va|pour that endureth but a &s;hort time. There are the <HI>untimely Births which never &s;ee the Light:</HI> and many that are <HI>Born alive,</HI> yet only number a <HI>few breaths, hours and days,</HI> and <HI>expire</HI> again, without fulfilling their <HI>Week</HI> or <HI>Month.</HI> What <HI>brittle</HI> and tender things are our <HI>Babes,</HI> and what multitudes die in <HI>Infancy! Delights, lent</HI> us for a year it may be, and then <HI>taken</HI> (we hope) to the Delights of God for ever. In <HI>Childhood</HI> the blooming flow|er falls too, and <HI>Autumn</HI> comes almo&s;t before the <HI>Spring</HI>'s begun. If thro' a million Dangers, mortal to others, we get up to <HI>Youth,</HI> yet how &s;ud|denly and often does Death cut down the ver|dant <HI>budding plant!</HI> And when from Youth we are got to <HI>Manhood,</HI> even then in the prime of our &s;trength we are often &s;natch away from Fami|lies,
<PB N="6" REF="001671_0013_0FB4E28516A98380">from Service, and from all Worldly Enjoy|ments. Job 21.23. <HI>The number of his months are cut off in the mid&s;t; he dies in his full strength, his Brea&s;ts are full of Milk, and his Bones are moistned with Marrow.</HI></P>
<P>Thus is it with the Children of Men; and this <HI>happens alike to all,</HI> both to the <HI>Evil and the Good.</HI> Now my <HI>De&s;ign</HI> is with Mode&s;ty and Holy Reve|rence to Enquire into the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> of Providence in this particular, which tho' it may &s;ometimes appear very dark, and be very grievous to particu|lar per&s;ons, <HI>yet certainly</HI> is in it &s;elf very <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> and Holy and Gracious.</P>
<P>I am to <HI>Ob&s;erve</HI> then, that abundance of our <HI>hopeful and lovely</HI> and promi&s;ing Children, and tho&s;e top that are <HI>really Pious and Godly</HI> in their Childhood, do Die Young.

He died not, it's true, but was the <HI>Earnest</HI> to the Old World of the <HI>Re&s;urrection.</HI> The <HI>ten Children of Job,</HI> who we hope Inherited their pious Fathers <HI>Sanctity, and Prayers,</HI> died together in their Youth. Heavy the Tydings to their amazed <HI>Parents&mdash;The Hou&s;e fell upon the Young men, and they are dead, and I on|ly am e&s;caped alone to tell thee.</HI> Sometimes the <HI>Holie&s;t,</HI> and whom God loves be&s;t, he takes <HI>&s;oone&s;t.</HI>

<P>And now give me leave to do &s;ome Honour un|to the <HI>Divine Providence,</HI> (as it &s;hall enable me) in ordering the&s;e Early Deaths.

I'm afraid that the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God is not at all conceived of, nor adored by multitudes of Chri&s;tians, as it ought to be. The <HI>Scripture</HI> every where &s;peaks in the mo&s;t <HI>exalted &s;trains</HI> that can be about it. And when the <HI>Di&s;|pen&s;ations</HI> of God are &s;uch as furprize and confound
<PB N="8" REF="001671_0015_0FB4E28A8CE6B430">our weak Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding, then very often in&s;tead of going about to &s;atisfy our &s;cruples, and level them to our Capacity, it bids us <HI>wor&s;hip,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>arguing</HI> about the Un&s;earchable Councils of Heaven; and contemplating the Greatne&s;s of God to be <HI>dumb.</HI> So in Gods dealings with his Servant <HI>Job,</HI> when he and his Friends had been contemplating the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch Inflictions on an Upright per&s;on; at la&s;t <HI>Elihu</HI> takes up the Argument, and reproves them all for pre&s;uming to talk &s;o freely of the Great GOD; asking them if God were to give them Account of what He did or could do? or if they mu&s;t be di&s;&s;atisfy'd with the Almighty's Actions when ever they could not account for them? He vouch&s;afes them no other &s;atisfaction but the Greatne&s;s &amp; <HI>Dominion</HI> of God; and when God him&s;elf &s;pake afterward out of the <HI>Whirlwind,</HI> it was in the &s;ame lofty Style and Rea|&s;oning; proper to, and worthy of a God. <HI>Job</HI> 33.12, 13, 17.36.22, 23, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Very ju&s;tly may the Great GOD <HI>di&s;dain</HI> to let us rea&s;on with him again&s;t any Circum&s;tances which He orders for us, either in re&s;pect of Life or Death.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Our lovely, gracious Elect Children cannot be too &s;oon in Heaven.</HI> Happine&s;s and Bli&s;s in the fulne&s;s and perfection thereof can never come too &s;oon. If God takes the Elect <HI>Infant</HI> from the <HI>Mothers Breast,</HI> or the <HI>Fathers Knees,</HI> to Him&s;elf an infi|nitely better Father; pray, what lo&s;s is it? How ble&s;&s;ed is it for the <HI>Babe</HI> that no more days or months were ordained for it in this &s;corching and freezing world of ours! in this world of Sin and Affliction! Will the Babe pine after the Mothers Brea&s;ts, when Angels have taken it in their brighter Arms to carry it to, and lay it in the Bo&s;ome of <HI>JES&V;S;</HI> the Good Shepherd of Souls, who layes the <HI>Lambs</HI> in his Bo&s;ome?

<P N="3">3. <HI>Sometimes it has been the de&s;ire and choice of Holy Children, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Sovereign Plea&s;ure and Wi&s;dom of God, not to have a long conti|nuance here in this World.</HI> This is a rare thing in|deed, yet we lately had an <HI>In&s;tance</HI> of it in our Neighbourhood, in that Excellent <HI>Youth,</HI> the <HI>Son</HI> of Major <HI>Fitch,</HI> who&s;e gracious Example, and la|mented Death will not be &s;oon forgotten. It was

'Twas a &s;ign that his heart was &s;oon and &s;trangely &s;et on Heavenly Things. This re|quires &s;ome very comfortable degrees of hope and <HI>good a&s;&s;urance</HI> of our Intere&s;t in a better Life. There are but few even of the Children of God in ad|vanced years, who upon &s;ettled and weighed prin|ciples of Devotion, arrive unto an <HI>habitual willing|ne&s;s</HI> to Die. Yet &s;ome &s;trange <HI>Instances</HI> of it have been found under the Early Impre&s;&s;ions of Divine Grace: The <HI>fear of Sin,</HI> the longing for <HI>freedom</HI> from it, and the de&s;ire to be <HI>with Chri&s;t,</HI> may &s;ome|times excu&s;e even the de&s;ire to be <HI>di&s;&s;olved,</HI> pre|&s;erving <HI>Re&s;ignation</HI> to God: but the <HI>Glorifying</HI> God on Earth, the Serving our Generation according to the Will of God, and the Believing in the <HI>Al&s;uf|ficiency</HI> of the Grace of God to <HI>keep</HI> us thro' the World, mu&s;t make Life when prolonged, not only <HI>ea&s;ie,</HI> but <HI>delightful</HI> to us, and an <HI>Esteemed Mercy</HI> of God to us. Certainly to <HI>abide</HI> in the fle&s;h is very <HI>needful</HI> and <HI>de&s;irable,</HI> while <HI>to live is Chri&s;t:</HI> but when we change this <HI>thought,</HI> and can &s;ay to our &s;elves&mdash;<HI>to me to die is Gain,</HI> it may be difficult not to <HI>verge</HI> too much with the Holy <HI>Apostle</HI> in his de&s;ires rather of a di&s;&s;olution; &amp; to <HI>groan being bur|dened in this Tabernacle; knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are ab&s;ent from the Lord,</HI> Phil. 21.23. 2 Cor. 5. begin.

<PB N="12" REF="001671_0019_0FB4E291C10EFF00">of God with great Rea&s;on joyn rather in that part of our <HI>Littany,</HI> to be <HI>pre&s;erved from it.</HI> How|ever, it very much takes away the <HI>darkne&s;s</HI> of the Di&s;pen&s;ation, when it comes to be the matter of a devout per&s;ons de&s;ire and choice. But the&s;e are Extraordinary <HI>Ca&s;es,</HI> not to be bro't into <HI>Example,</HI> nor to be commended to our Imitation; &amp; there|fore not to be in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Po&s;&s;ibly God may have con&s;ulted the Spiritual ad|vantage of a de&s;irable and gracious Child in its Early Death.</HI> I mean both in re&s;pect of <HI>Grace</HI> here, and <HI>Glory</HI> hereafter. Had the Child lived, you know how certainly it had been <HI>expo&s;ed</HI> in this place of &s;in, temptation and danger: what from the <HI>Snake in the Gra&s;s,</HI> latent Indwelling Sin, and that <HI>Adder in the Path,</HI> the Devi and Satan; what from an In&s;naring World, and the lu&s;ting fle&s;h re&s;i&s;ting the <HI>Spirit</HI> in all its heavenly de&s;ires. It is a Cir|cum&s;tance of great happine&s;s to be once &s;afely pa&s;t all the&s;e <HI>hazards,</HI> &amp; out of the reach of the&s;e mor|tal Enemies and <HI>fiery darts;</HI> never to be tempted, nor to &s;in more; but to be confirm'd in a State of Grace, and a&s;certain'd, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Everla&s;ting Happine&s;s. Now God only knows how little a longer time might have been improved; how lit|tle might have been got by it, how much might have indeed been &s;uffered by it. It is a &s;ad truth, but a certain one, <HI>that many Good people have found little or no advantage to their Spirtual Life by length of time.</HI> They were Converted young, it may be,
<PB N="13" REF="001671_0020_0FB4E2933ACE69B0">and if they had died young, they had been in the &s;ame place in Heaven, if not in a better, then ha|ving liv'd to more years. How often have people gone backward, quench'd the Spirit of Grace, and hurt their own Souls. Take the In&s;tance of <HI>Solo|mon;</HI> how gloriou&s;ly did he begin, and out&s;hone in Grace, as he did in Wi&s;dom and Dignity: He was the <HI>Wonder</HI> of the Church, as his <HI>Temple</HI> was of the World: He went before the very <HI>Ministers</HI> of Re|ligion, and the Lords Prophets in zeal and in devo|tion: and now had he died young, his Grace had been without a <HI>stain</HI> upon it: but he liv'd to &s;how the <HI>frailty</HI> of the Greate&s;t <HI>Saint</HI> in a State of World|ly <HI>Affluence,</HI> and the hazard there is from <HI>Sen&s;ual Objects</HI> in our greate&s;t Attainments here below. I dare not pre&s;ume to think whether his fall has put him a great way <HI>back</HI> in the Li&s;t of the Glorify'd, his Repentance and Recovery being glorious in our Eyes; but certainly if his <HI>Graces</HI> had not been brighter above, had he died in his un&s;potted youth, and before his fall, yet had his <HI>Name</HI> among Saints on Earth been &s;o.</P>
<P>We are <HI>Sailing</HI> in a very tempe&s;tuous and uncer|tain <HI>Sea,</HI> like <HI>Mariners</HI> that &s;ometimes &s;et out with a fair and &s;trong <HI>Gale,</HI> and make half their Pa&s;&s;age in a few days; but then they meet with &s;ome rough contrary Winds that force 'em <HI>to Ly by</HI> at lea&s;t, if they are not <HI>driven back,</HI> and have many a League to mea&s;ure over again, if ever they <HI>make</HI> their Pa&s;|&s;age at all. If the <HI>Ship</HI> &s;pring a <HI>leak,</HI> tho' it do
<PB N="14" REF="001671_0021_0FB4E2998A840C10">not founder, but after many hard&s;hips the <HI>Port</HI> is gained, yet the Lo&s;s and Damage &s;u&s;tained is u&s;ual|ly very much. So are there many that Set out well in their Youth, and at la&s;t get to Heaven, but it is &s;orely <HI>&s;hatter'd</HI> and <HI>broken,</HI> through their falls before one temptation and another in their way. The Floods do not <HI>drown</HI> them in perdition, but yet thro' their ill Conduct and fooli&s;h Management much of their rich Freight and Lading is <HI>damnify'd</HI> and thrown Overboard. They can &s;how the <HI>Rich|es</HI> they once had put aboard them, but alas, <HI>canker'd</HI> and marr'd now: they are not when they die, even what they were in their early years, but their <HI>Beauty</HI> marr'd by the advance of <HI>Age;</HI> which tho' it be natural to the <HI>Body,</HI> yet it is unnatural to the <HI>Immortal Soul.</HI> They die <HI>Penitents</HI> it's true, but not <HI>Proficients;</HI> and tho' they get to Heaven at la&s;t, yet no higher there than if they had died in their younger days.</P>
<P>Upon all, &s;ay, if it is not very po&s;&s;ible that God may graciou&s;ly have con&s;ulted the Spiritual Ad|vantage of many an Elect Ve&s;&s;el of Mercy, in their Early Death. We have no <HI>fore&s;ight</HI> of things to come, but God has the mo&s;t perfect that can be; and tho' there's no fore&s;ight of Grace in the Saints before it is given, but only in the purpo&s;e of God to give it, for in our corrupt nature it never could be at all but of his free Gift; yet in the be&s;t of Saints there's an ea&s;ie fore&s;ight to us all of Corrup|tion ready to break out upon all Occa&s;ions, with|out
<PB N="15" REF="001671_0022_0FB4E29C4AA70D00">Gods re&s;traint and prevention thereof: and to God it <HI>is open and naked</HI> how good people will act if they come to be in the&s;e and tho&s;e Circum&s;tan|ces.

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>It &s;hows us that Grace intends not to &s;ecure us a long Life here in the Body.</HI> No, it is the <HI>a&s;&s;imilation</HI> of the Soul unto another Life, and its <HI>preparation</HI> for it: it is to <HI>wean</HI> the Soul from the &s;en&s;itive life, and to <HI>rai&s;e</HI> it above the &s;ame: it <HI>points</HI> the Soul unto the life of &s;pirits in holine&s;s and happi|ne&s;s that is <HI>to come;</HI> and on no pretence therefore can it fix the heart down in any de&s;ires or pro&s;|pect of living long here. Indeed, <HI>Grace never &s;hort|ned any ones life here,</HI> but has prolong'd rather ma|ny a <HI>mans; length of days are in her right hand</HI> and <HI>long life &s;hall &s;he add unto thee:</HI> Prov. 3.16. There is nothing in a principle of Grace and Holy living, but what tends to the pre&s;ervation and lengthening
<PB N="18" REF="001671_0025_0FB4E2A0C0ED6D40">out of mans life. It bears antipathy to, and de|te&s;tation of all tho&s;e <HI>Intemperances</HI> and vicious <HI>Ex|ce&s;&s;es,</HI> which &s;horten mens days. It does by <HI>trust and prayer</HI> commit us to the care &amp; ble&s;&s;ing of the God of our lives. It de&s;ires to live to his Glory; and it &s;ecures to us that &s;o far as God &s;ees it be&s;t for us, we &s;hall live in his world. But no further can a principle of Grace look to a continuance of the pre&s;ent life. No, the fir&s;t and chief <HI>Relation</HI> of Divine Grace, and <HI>Benefit</HI> from it is unto a life to come. Col. 3.3. <HI>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in GOD.</HI> The <HI>Spiritual Life</HI> only is worthy to be called <HI>our Life;</HI> and <HI>this</HI> is hid with <HI>Christ;</HI> as the life of the <HI>Branches</HI> is hid in the <HI>Root:</HI> So are our Hopes for Eternity depo&s;ited and laid up with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in Heaven.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Again, The Death of pious Children teaches us this al&s;o of a <HI>Principle of Grace, that where it once is, the Soul is &s;afe.</HI> Let Death come as <HI>&s;oon</HI> as it will after a per&s;ons <HI>Cover&s;ion,</HI> when once a Sancti|fying Change has pa&s;&s;ed on him, be he never &s;o young, the Soul is &s;afe. It is indeed <HI>very de&s;irable</HI> to us on many accounts, that there be &s;ome good <HI>&s;pace</HI> granted to us for the <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of Grace, and the <HI>Actings</HI> of the Regenerate Life: that &s;o <HI>the Great GOD</HI> may have &s;ome Honour and Service from us, the fruits of that Grace which He hath Implanted in us; and <HI>we</HI> &s;ome good Evidence and hope of His Grace in us, and of our Title to Eter|nal Life; that &s;o we may at la&s;t die in peace and
<PB N="19" REF="001671_0026_0FB4E2AB8664BFD0"><HI>Comfort</HI> as well as <HI>Safety.</HI> But this is not <HI>ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary:</HI> and a per&s;on really dies in peace, in a State of Salvation, and goes to Heaven, if a Change be truly wro't in the Soul, tho' God do not &s;pare him any length of time to bring forth the fruits of his Grace. And the Early Deaths of pious <HI>Ones</HI> may &s;atisfie us, <HI>That Salvation depends not on length of time for the continued Exerci&s;e of Grace;</HI> tho' it be in its &s;elf a Favour of GOD greatly to be de&s;i|red, if it may be His Will.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Hence al&s;o does it evidently appear, <HI>that Sal|vation is not of Works, but of Free Grace altogether.</HI> If it were of Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s wro't by us, it were much to be apprehended that they who die young could never be &s;aved. If <HI>Infants</HI> are &s;aved, it mu&s;t be of free Grace, forthe&s;e can have no <HI>Works</HI> of their own: no, not &s;o much as one <HI>Act of Faith</HI> are they capable of: and yet <HI>of &s;uch is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> Multitudes of <HI>them</HI> are &s;ancti|fy'd and ju&s;tify'd, and taken to Heaven. In &s;ome proportion it is thus with him that dies young: &s;uppo&s;e within the <HI>Month</HI> or the <HI>Year</HI> wherein the Grace of God has taken hold of his Heart; when he is but ju&s;t beginning to live to GOD, is but turning to Him in his own apprehen&s;ion, and by his own confe&s;&s;ion has done nothing for Him; but was beiginning he hop'd in earne&s;t to think of do|ing &s;omething, &amp; <HI>Now</HI> mu&s;t be gone: However, he dies in Chri&s;t and goes to Him: but then how rich and free is that Grace which &s;aves him? <HI>Where

</LIST></P>
<P>Wherefore to fini&s;h this <HI>Head, How amiable and adorable doth this render &s;aving Grace to us!</HI> that however young we die, 'tis po&s;&s;ible to be &s;aved by it; that how &s;oon &s;oever it takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us, it puts us into a &s;ecure and happy Sate.

<P>See you <HI>One</HI> that has but ju&s;t begun to &s;eek and &s;erve GOD, and GOD has &s;o &s;uddenly, in&s;tantly, pre&s;ently rewarded and glorified him! when CHRIST his <HI>Judge</HI> &s;hall name this <HI>Child</HI> with ho|nour in the <HI>Last Day,</HI> what can it an&s;wer?&mdash; LORD, when did I ever &s;erve Thee? What did I ever do for Thee? From the day that thy Grace found me, I had not a year, not a month, not a week (it may be) allowed me to live to honour Thee! No, Gracious LORD! in the day almo&s;t wherein thou did&s;t plea&s;e to <HI>Sanctifie</HI> me thou did&s;t al&s;o <HI>Glorifie</HI> me. E'er I cou'd find thy <HI>Grace</HI> in my <HI>Soul,</HI> I found my &s;elf <HI>taken</HI> to thy <HI>Glory;</HI> and as I was but beginning to <HI>&s;eek</HI> thy Mercy, I found my &s;elf Embraced in the <HI>Arms</HI> of it.</P>
<P>O what &s;hould render GOD &amp; His Grace more amiable to us, than his glorifying it after this man|ner to the young Penitent, the <HI>Infant Saint!</HI> No &s;ooner born from <HI>Above,</HI> than taken <HI>Thither.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. And <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> The Death of tho&s;e that are pious and gracious in their Youth <HI>is of excellent &V;&s;e, and
<PB N="21" REF="001671_0028_0FB4E2AFC8837180">great Nece&s;&s;ity, to quicken and excite their Acquain|tance, Friends and Relations to an in&s;tar and careful Preparation for their own Dying Hour.</HI> Many are the <HI>Instructions and Admonitions</HI> in it, both to <HI>Elder</HI> and <HI>Younger</HI> People. It may be of great Service to <HI>Survivors.</HI> And this is a <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> worthy of a <HI>Good GOD,</HI> who&s;e care is for the Souls of <HI>many</HI> in his Providential Dealings with <HI>One.</HI></P>
<P>Let me then <HI>Ob&s;erve,</HI> and &s;o make the proper <HI>Application</HI> of the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> in this <HI>Illustration</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. That to be &s;ure in the Early Death of pious Children, there are many U&s;eful <HI>Admonitions in|tended to tho&s;e that are Young.</HI> Younger <HI>Friends and Relatives</HI> &s;hould take the <HI>Warnings</HI> of GOD, which are <HI>firstly and directly</HI> meant to them.</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> mu&s;t be admoni&s;h'd, <HI>O Young Per&s;on,</HI> that you your &s;elf <HI>may die &s;oon and &s;uddenly</HI> likewi&s;e. You &s;hould never &s;ee one of your <HI>Own Age</HI> buried, or one younger than your &s;elf die, but you &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly think&mdash;'It might have been <HI>my turn</HI> as well, or mine may be the <HI>next,</HI> and within a <HI>few</HI> days (if not to <HI>day</HI> or to <HI>morrow</HI>) I may follow. What am I better than my <HI>Companion?</HI> or it may be my life is not of half the worth that <HI>his</HI> or <HI>hers</HI> was! nor has been half &s;o well improved or re|deemed! or if it has, yet this makes no diffe|rence; &s;ince the <HI>best</HI> die young.</P>
<P>See one proof of that <HI>Truth,</HI> P&s;al. 39.5. <HI>Veri|lye very man at his be&s;t E&s;tate is altogether Vanity.</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="001671_0029_0FB4E2B2370B04C8">A Flouri&s;hing Youth and Piety met together &s;eem one of the be&s;t E&s;tates of Man: the &s;trength of our years united with the &s;trength of Grace. 1 Joh. 2.14. <HI>I write unto you young men, becau&s;e ye are strong,</HI> &amp;c. Yet in this <HI>Vigour</HI> of Nature and Grace both, may we &s;uddenly expire and vani&s;h away.</P>
<P>Wherefore <HI>Early Religion is the highest Wi&s;dom, and Interest of all the Children of men;</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>Im|portant</HI> and nece&s;&s;ary thing that can be. You can never begin too &s;oon to think of your Souls, &s;ince you may every day look to die. This alone ought to awaken you to <HI>remember your Creator</HI> in the days of your Youth, and as you enter upon this life, to chu&s;e that <HI>Good part</HI> which can never be taken a|way from you; and to <HI>Seek first</HI> the Kingdom of GOD, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s. The <HI>Funeral</HI> of e|every <HI>Infant</HI> or <HI>Child,</HI> calls all the Children in the <HI>Streets</HI> to be thinking of, and preparing for their own Death: for if you are not too young to <HI>Die,</HI> neither are you to be <HI>Religious,</HI> and to make your Souls your care.</P>
<P>It <HI>warns</HI> you now in your Youth, that you <HI>need better Friends &amp; Dependance</HI> than any in this World, and a better <HI>Portion</HI> than this World can &s;latter you withal. For be you in the arms of your <HI>Pa|rents,</HI> or bereav'd of them can you number up a great many <HI>Friends</HI> that heartily re&s;pect you, and care for your Intere&s;ts? Are the <HI>Comforts</HI> of this Life &s;urrounding you and your Worldly <HI>E&s;tate</HI> in|crea&s;ing upon you? Yet a day or an hour may
<PB N="23" REF="001671_0030_0FB4E2B3A2197A18">&s;natch you away from all; while your helple&s;s Friends &s;tand in Amazement and Sorrow about you, to &s;ee you expire. <HI>That Child alone is &s;afe &amp; happy, who has the Great GOD for its Father, and Guardian and Portion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Children!</HI> Let me put it to you, whether you have ever yet began to think of your <HI>Souls,</HI> your <HI>Sins,</HI> your <HI>Saviour,</HI> your <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> your <HI>Dying Hour,</HI> and of <HI>Eternity.</HI> Do you <HI>pray,</HI> do you fear to &s;in, do you take any care to be Saved? O what Rea|&s;on there is to fear that few of you little con&s;ider any thing of this nature! which of you almo&s;t has any tho't about Death now in your Childhood? You &s;carce &s;eem to apprehend it <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> and much le&s;s do you realize it as very <HI>likely,</HI> that you may die young. Will you never begin to <HI>think,</HI> Young People? not one <HI>&s;ober tho't</HI> of your Eternal State, tho' you &s;ee &s;o many of your own Stature in the Grave. GOD <HI>teach</HI> thee betimes &s;o to <HI>num|ber thy days, as to apply thy heart unto Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>GOD can make the Death of your <HI>Companions</HI> a mo&s;t awakening and effectual <HI>Sermon</HI> to you: and it may be worth anothers dying to do thy Soul good, and bring thee home to <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> It <HI>preaches</HI> to thee in a more <HI>affecting manner</HI> than any meer words can, and in the <HI>happy &s;ea&s;on to Rela|tives,</HI> when their affections are &s;tirred, and their Souls the more ea&s;ily come at. And O that our Young people wou'd but hear the good Coun&s;els from the <HI>Funerals</HI> of their pious Friends that die
<PB N="24" REF="001671_0031_0FB4E2B8C0E5EF48">young! how well worth were it their dying, be|times to fa&s;ten &s;uch In&s;tructions for the Salvation of others.</P>
<P N="2">2. The death of hopeful Children and Young people may be of great Spiritual Advantage al&s;o to <HI>Elder per&s;ons. Parents</HI> &s;hould be quickned in Holy Living, by the death of their Children; and the <HI>Grey Head</HI> &s;hould receive In&s;truction &amp; Awa|kening by the fall of the blooming Youth. There are many things &s;aid to them that are in Advanced <HI>Age,</HI> in the Death of their <HI>Juniors.</HI></P>
<P>Are the&s;e fallen &s;o <HI>&s;oon,</HI> how <HI>long ago</HI> then might I have been in my Grave? may the <HI>Elder Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;ay. Adore the Sovereign Grace of GOD, that has &s;o long &s;pared you. Had you been cut down thus &s;oon, think what had become of you, &amp; where had you been long &s;ince? Con&s;ider why God &s;pares you. <HI>Shame</HI> your &s;elf for your Defects, and <HI>fear:</HI> If the <HI>green tree</HI> be fell'd, laden with Blo&s;&s;oms, or fir&s;t ripe fruits; what then &s;hall be done to the <HI>dry?</HI> Shall <HI>that</HI> &s;tand always <HI>barren</HI> and unprofita|ble, to <HI>cumber the Ground?</HI> What? &s;ee we a Child <HI>Older</HI> in Grace, and wi&s;er and better than we in Years? our &s;elves not &s;o <HI>ripe</HI> for Heaven, as tho&s;e that were <HI>&V;nborn</HI> when we were Men &amp; Women! So the <HI>Army of I&s;rael</HI> blu&s;h'd when they &s;aw the <HI>ruddy Boy</HI> excel them all in Faith and Valour.</P>
<P>Are &s;o many <HI>Young Ones</HI> in Heaven, and are we <HI>Old</HI> and never like to get thither? How can we bear the tho't? or how &s;hall we when Death comes?</P>
<PB N="25" REF="001671_0032_0FB4E2BC96A6E788">
<P>Are &s;o many Young Ones in Heaven, and You O <HI>Aged Believer &s;o little Ready</HI> in your own Ac|count? Your Evidences &s;o little clear? Your In|tere&s;t in Chri&s;t &s;o doubtful? Your Days &s;pun and worn out to &s;o little purpo&s;e? How &s;hould it quicken you to give all diligence in making your Election &s;ure?</P>
<P>Do &s;o many Younger die in <HI>Christ,</HI> and have not we had all their Opportunities, and more by far than all tho&s;e which they have &s;o well and timely Improved? How will they ri&s;e up in Judg|ment again&s;t us, and condemn us! O fatal <HI>diffe|rence</HI> between man and man! <HI>Some</HI> dying young in <HI>Chri&s;t, others</HI> living old <HI>Christle&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Take the <HI>Alarm, O Dying Aged Sinner!</HI> if one come to thee from the <HI>Dead</HI> thou wilt repent! &amp; that too as we paint the bright <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD with a <HI>Youthful Mein and Air!</HI> let him tell thee with a charming voice of the <HI>Glories</HI> he has <HI>&s;o &s;oon</HI> pa&s;s'd into, and invite thee tho' <HI>&s;o late</HI> to &s;eek a part in tho&s;e un&s;peakable and Eternal Felicities! What? will not this <HI>Glorious Vi&s;ion</HI> it &s;elf Convert thee! No, tho' one come like <HI>Lazarus</HI> from the Bo&s;ome of <HI>Abraham</HI> unto you</P>
<P>You that are <HI>Parents,</HI> be you quickned to <HI>think &s;eriou&s;ly of dying your &s;elves.</HI> The fruit of your Bodies are already (&s;ome of them) in the Grave; how &s;oon may you look to be there too? Death that has already torn out &s;ome of your <HI>Bowels,</HI> will &s;oon pierce your <HI>Heart.</HI> Parents are &s;o &s;e|cure
<PB N="26" REF="001671_0033_0FB4E2BE0BD3E888">and forgetful of their own Mortality, that Death mu&s;t needs lay its cold hand on their Bo|&s;ome, and take their Babes thence, to awaken 'em: And &s;urely they will &s;en&s;ibly feel them&s;elves Mortal, while they &s;ee a part of them&s;elves In|terr'd already. So <HI>David</HI> graciou&s;ly improv'd the death of <HI>his Child,&mdash;I &s;hall go to it.</HI> Say thus, O <HI>Parent,</HI> to thy &s;elf: I &s;hall &s;oon follow; and be it thy care (O my Soul) &s;o to improve thy pre&s;ent Sorrows, and the Re&s;idue of thy few Evil Dayes in the fle&s;h, that I may meet <HI>mine</HI> whom I have committed to <HI>Christ,</HI> with Joy in His Pre&s;ence at the la&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Three words</HI> of Advice let me leave with <HI>Pa|rents,</HI> re&s;pecting their <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To begin betimes to In&s;titute them for GOD. We mu&s;t give them up to GOD in <HI>Bap|ti&s;m;</HI> and as &s;oon as they are able to learn teach them to know God, and fear Him, and &s;erve Him. Betimes tell 'em of their Precious Souls, and of their Glorious Saviour, and of their Dying Con|dition. Put them betimes on preparing for Death: they will die never the &s;ooner for it, but may much the better, and you'll have the more peace and comfort in their death, if they are <HI>&s;ud|denly</HI> taken from you. Your Children are daily liable to the &s;troke of Death, where then (O Parent) is your Care or Love or Kindne&s;s to them, if you do not what you can to prepare 'em for it! And how reverently ought Children to
<PB N="27" REF="001671_0034_0FB4E2BF7B5CF1F8">mind what their Parents &s;ay to 'em about their Future and Everla&s;ting Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let Parents prepare betimes to part</HI> with their lovely Children, and get their <HI>Soul even as a weaned. Child;</HI> even before they wean their <HI>Babes</HI> from their Brea&s;t. We mu&s;t look for <HI>Abrahams</HI> trial and E|mulate his <HI>Faith,</HI> Gen. 22.2. <HI>Take now thy Son, thine only Son I&s;aac, whom thou lovest, and offer him up to Me.</HI> Our <HI>best</HI> are GOD's Due; What He made for Him&s;elf, and <HI>lends</HI> for a while to us. GOD comes into His <HI>Garden,</HI> and plucks which <HI>flower</HI> He plea&s;es, and which but the mo&s;t <HI>beautiful</HI> &amp; <HI>fragrant</HI> do men gather? Let the Great GOD take <HI>his own,</HI> &amp; let us make <HI>Abels</HI> acceptable Offering, <HI>the best of our Flock.</HI> The <HI>Shunamite,</HI> that <HI>Great Woman,</HI> had one <HI>wondrous</HI> Son, a &s;pecial <HI>Gift</HI> of Heaven to her in Reward of her <HI>Piety;</HI> but &s;oon had She the &s;orrow to &s;ee him die, and that very <HI>&s;uddenly,</HI> in her <HI>lap:</HI> She made no <HI>Shriek</HI> in that terrible <HI>Sur|prize,</HI> nor &s;o much as &s;hew'd her Di&s;tre&s;s to Her Hou&s;hold; no, not to her <HI>Husband,</HI> the partner of her Joyes and Griefs: She went to GOD, <HI>i. e.</HI> un|to his <HI>Prophets</HI> feet, where her humble &s;ilent <HI>Acti|on</HI> &s;pake tho&s;e Augui&s;hes which no Words could utter: the mean while her Re&s;ignation to the Will of GOD, &amp; her Contentment therein, was mo&s;t ad|mirable: the <HI>Child was dead,</HI> yet &s;aid &s;he,&mdash;<HI>All is well.</HI> Give me leave thus to <HI>Pharaphra&s;e</HI> it.</P>
<Q><L>What GOD Ordains is <HI>Well</HI> and <HI>Be&s;t.</HI></L>
<L>It's <HI>Well</HI> with <HI>Ours</HI> when gone to Re&s;t.</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="001671_0035_0FB4E2C34BCC2440">
It's <HI>Well</HI> with <HI>&V;s</HI> who &s;tay behind,</L>
<L>If more from Earth and Fle&s;h re&s;in'd,</L>
<L>We're patient, pray'rful, meek, re&s;ign'd.</L></Q>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us be Comforted and quieted in the Death of hopeful Children.</HI> A Child <HI>in Heaven</HI> is well <HI>provi|ded</HI> for, well <HI>di&s;pos'd</HI> of, well <HI>preferr'd.</HI> It has a good <HI>Portion,</HI> is gone to a good <HI>Father,</HI> to a good <HI>Family,</HI> to good <HI>Company;</HI> to an Everla&s;ting Re&s;t, and to Infinite Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. The Covenant of God embraces our Children with more tenderne&s;s, than our Arms ever did. Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead in Chri&s;t, that are &s;oon pa&s;s'd from Sin and Sorrow here, to the Eternal Fulne&s;s of Holine&s;s and Comfort in the Pre&s;ence of GOD for ever.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not repeat <HI>Jacobs</HI> Error, who &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf <HI>bereaved,</HI> when <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was only <HI>Advancing</HI> under the &s;pecial Favour of Providence in <HI>Another Countrey.</HI> He would needs be an <HI>Incon&s;olable</HI> Mourn+er, <HI>and go down into the Grave after his Son mourning,</HI> But in time he heard <HI>of all his Glory in Egypt,</HI> (which what was it to the Glory of the lea&s;t of our <HI>Little Ones</HI> that behold the Face of God in Heaven) and then the good <HI>Patriarchs Spirit revived,</HI> and he &s;aid,&mdash;<HI>Jo&s;eph my Son is yet alive, I'll go and &s;ee him before I die.</HI> Truly, &s;o, <HI>O Chri&s;tian,</HI> the Child thou mourne&s;t over may be now in Heaven and Glorify'd; It is thy Hope and Faith it is &s;o: let thy <HI>&s;inking</HI> Spi|rit then <HI>revive</HI> and &s;ay,&mdash;By the <HI>Grace</HI> of God, I will endeavour &s;o to <HI>live,</HI> that I may <HI>See</HI> it in Glory when I <HI>Die.</HI></P>
