<HEAD>AN ORATION &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fathers, Brethren, and Countrymen!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AN occa&s;ion truly &s;olemn has a&s;&s;embled us this day; and, that your attention may be alike &s;olemn and &s;erious, hear, in the fir&s;t place, the voice of eternal truth. <Q>It is better to go to the Hou&s;e of Mourning than to the Hou&s;e of Fea&s;ting;</Q> for&mdash; <Q>None of us liveth to him&s;elf, and no man dieth to him&s;elf;</Q></P>
<P>But there are &s;ome men, illuminated with a pu|rer ray of divinity; Patriots of the fir&s;t magnitude, who, in a peculiar &s;en&s;e, may be &s;aid to live and die, not to them&s;elves, but to others; and con&s;e|quently to him who is the author of all goodne&s;s, Endowed with that &s;uperior excellence which does honour to our whole &s;pecies, the virtuous of every nation claim kindred with them; and the general intere&s;ts of humanity are concerned in their charac|ter.</P>
<P>In veneration of &s;uch men, to exchange the ac|cu&s;tomed walks of plea&s;ure for the Hou&s;e of Mourning; to bedew its &s;acred rece&s;&s;es with tears of gratitude to their memory; to &s;trive, if po&s;&s;ible, to catch &s;ome portion of their eternal &s;pirit, as it mounts from this earthly &s;phere, into perfect union with congenial &s;pirits above, is a laudable cu&s;tom,
<PB N="4" REF="015085_0003_0F95A7F2A43B7B70">coeval with &s;ociety, and &s;anctified to us by the ex|ample of the wi&s;e&s;t nations.</P>
<P>It was the manner of the Egyptians, the fathers of arts and &s;cience, not only to celebrate the names, but to embalm the bodies, of their decea&s;ed he|roes, that they might be long pre&s;erved in public view, as examples of virtue; and, although "dead, yet &s;peaking,"</P>
<P>But this honour was not ea&s;ily to be obtained; nor was it be&s;towed indi&s;criminately upon the vul|gar Great. It was decreed only by the public voice, a venerable a&s;&s;embly of Judges, before whom the body of the decea&s;ed was brought for trial, and &s;olemnly acquitted or condemned upon the evidence of the people.</P>
<P>Even Kings them&s;elves, however much &s;pared when alive, for the &s;ake of public tranquility, had &s;till this more than fiery Ordeal before their eyes; and, by the example of &s;ome of their number, who had been refu&s;ed &s;epulture in tho&s;e very tombs which their pride had prepared to their own me|mory, were taught both to venerate and to dread a law, which extended its puni&s;hments beyond the u&s;ual times of oblivion.</P>
<P>The moral of this in&s;titution was truly &s;ublime, con&s;tantly inculcating a mo&s;t important le&s;&s;on&mdash; "That whatever di&s;tinctions our wants and vices may render nece&s;&s;ary, in this &s;hort and imperfect period of our being, they are all cancelled by the hand of death; and, through the endle&s;s untried periods which &s;ucceed, virtue and beneficence will make the true di&s;tinctions, and be the only founda|tions of happine&s;s and renown!</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="015085_0004_0F95A7F379F62E38">
If from the Egyptians, we pa&s;s to the Greeks, particularly the enlightened Athenians, we &s;hall find that they had an expre&s;s law, appointing Ora|tions, and public Funerals, in honour of tho&s;e who gloriou&s;ly &s;acrificed their lives to their coun|try. And this &s;olemn office was performed before the great a&s;&s;emblies of the people; &s;ometimes for one, and &s;ometimes for bands of heroes together.</P>
<P>Thucydides, has recorded a cerebrated Oration of this la&s;t kind, delivered by Pericles. The illu&s;|trious &s;peaker, after a mo&s;t animating de&s;cription of the <HI>Amor Patriae,</HI> the love of our country&mdash; which he exalts above all human virtues, turns to the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q>Having be&s;towed their lives to the public, every one of them, &s;ays he, hath received a prai&s;e that will never decay; a &s;epulchre that will always be mo&s;t illu&s;trious; not that in which their bones lie mouldering, but that in which their fame is pre&s;erved. This whole earth is the &s;epulchre of illu&s;trious citizens</Q>&mdash;and their in|&s;cription is written upon the hearts of all good men.</P>
<P><Q>As for you, the &s;urvivors, from this very mo|ment, emulating their virtues, place your &s;ole happine&s;s in liberty, and be prepared to follow its call through every danger.</Q> Then, addre&s;|&s;ing him&s;elf, with exqui&s;ite tenderne&s;s, to the re|licts and children of the decea&s;ed, he &s;ugge&s;ts to them, that the common wealth was their hu&s;band, their father, and brother.</P>
<P><Q>From this day forward, to the age of matu|rity, &s;hall the Orphans be educated at the public
<PB N="6" REF="015085_0005_0F95A7F81FD6B220">expence of the &s;tate. For this benevolent meed have the laws appointed to all future relicts of tho&s;e who may fall in the public conte&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P>Nor were the Romans le&s;s careful in this mat|ter. Con&s;idering men in general as brave, more by art than nature; and that honour is a more powerful incentive than fear; they made frugality, temperance, patience, and labor, manly exerci&s;e, and love of their country, the main principles of education. Cowardice and neglect of duty in the field, were &s;eldom puni&s;hed with death or corpo|ral inflictions; but by what was accounted wor&s;e, a life decreed to ignominious expul&s;ion and de|gradation from Roman privileges.</P>
<P>On the contrary, deeds of public virtue were re|warded, according to their magnitude, with &s;ta|tues, triumphs of various kinds, peculiar badges of dre&s;s at public &s;olemnities, and &s;ongs of prai&s;e to the living as well as the dead.</P>
<P>Next to the hymns compo&s;ed in honor of the Gods; Poetry derived its origin from the &s;ongs of triumph to heroes, who tamed the rude manners of mankind, founded cities, repelled the incur&s;ions of enemies, and gave peace to their country. And this cu&s;tom began when Rome contained only a few &s;hepherds, gathering &s;trength by an alluvies of the outca&s;ts of neighbouring nations.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e fir&s;t efforts of poetic eulogy, whether in pro&s;e or ver&s;e (like tho&s;e of a &s;imilar origin, which nature, always the &s;ame, teaches our &s;avage neigh|bours) although often &s;ublime in &s;ub&s;tance, were yet &s;o rude in &s;tructure, that Livy forbears quoting them, as having become intolerable to the more
<PB N="7" REF="015085_0006_0F95A7F8D5E38400">refined ta&s;te of their po&s;terity; however &s;uitable they might nave been to the aera of their production.</P>
<P>What a multitude of compo&s;itions of this kind mu&s;t have exi&s;ted between the barbarous &s;ongs of the military upon the triumph of Co&s;ius, and the celebrated panegyric of Pliny upon Trajan! They are &s;aid to have been &s;welled into two thou&s;and volumes, even in the time of Augu&s;tus. In &s;hort, the prai&s;e of public virtue was wrought into the whole texture of Roman polity; and Virgil, calling Religion to his aid, gave it the highe&s;t fini&s;h.</P>
<P>He divides his Hades, or place of Gho&s;ts, into different regions; and to the gulph of deepe&s;t per|dition, con&s;igns tho&s;e mon&s;ters of iniquity who delighted in the de&s;truction of mankind, betrayed their country, or violated its religion and laws. There he excruciates them, in company with</P>
<P>"Gorgons and Hydras and Chimeras dire&mdash;" Vultures prey upon their vitals, or they are whirled eternally round with Ixion upon his wheel, or bound down with Tantalus, who&s;e burning lips hang quivering over the elu&s;ive waters it cannot touch; or the Fury Ti&s;yphone, her hair entwin'd with &s;erpents, her garments red with human gore, urges on their tortures with unrelenting hand!</P>
<P>The Poet having thus exhau&s;ted imagination as well as mythology, in the de&s;cription of puni&s;h|ments for the di&s;turbers of mankind and foes to their country, rai&s;es his conclu&s;ion to a height of horror beyond the reach of expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;
<Q><L>"Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues,</L>
<L>"A voice of bra&s;s, and adamantine lungs;</L>
<L>"Not half the mighty &s;cene could I di&s;clo&s;e;</L>
<L>"Repeat their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> their dreadful woes.</L></Q>
<PB N="8" REF="015085_0007_0F95A7FC0D3E8890">Nor has Virgil &s;trayed any farther through the fields of fancy or fable in this place, than to bor|row &s;trength of colouring for the garb of truth; and I &s;u&s;pect, that he drank from a purer fountain than that of Helicon, when he peopled his Tartarus with the ancient &s;courges of the human race. An au|thority &s;acred among chri&s;tians has indeed given us a mo&s;t awful confirmation of his doctrine.</P>
<P>A Prophet and Poet indeed, who&s;e in&s;piration was truly from Heaven, the incomparably &s;ublime ISAIAH, foretelling the fall of Babylon, has an Ode of triumph, wherein he exults over its haughty Monarch in &s;trains of wonderful irony and re|proach. He reprobates him as a de&s;troyer of man|kind; who had "made the world a wilderne&s;s." He repre&s;ents the whole earth as delivered from a cur&s;e by his fall! The trees of the fore&s;t rejoice, becau&s;e he is laid low! The very grave refu&s;es a covering to his execrable cor&s;e! he is con&s;igned to the depths of mi&s;ery; while the infernal man&s;ions them&s;elves are moved at his approach, and the gho&s;ts of departed tyrants ri&s;e up, in horrid array and mockery of triumph, to bid him welcome to his final abode!</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hing grandeur and &s;pirit of this pa&s;|&s;age, and indeed of the whole Ode, are unrivalled by any Poet of Greek or Roman name.</P>
<P><Q>How hath the oppre&s;&s;or cea&s;ed! The Lord hath broken the &s;taff of the wicked! He that &s;mote the people in wrath&mdash;that ruled the nations in anger&mdash;is per&s;ecuted and none hindereth! The whole earth is at re&s;t&mdash;they break forth into &s;inging; yea the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and the
<PB N="9" REF="015085_0008_0F95A7FC75AB3E18">cedars of Lebanon, &s;aying, &s;ince thou art laid down no &s;eller is come up again&s;t us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming. It &s;tirreth up the dead for thee&mdash;even the chiefs of the nations! They &s;ay unto thee, art thouf al&s;o become weak as we? Thy pomp is brought down to the grave&mdash;How art thou fallen. O Lucifer, that did&s;t weaken the nations? All kings, (meaning ju&s;t and merciful kings) even all of them lie in glory, every one in his own hou&s;e (or &s;epulchre;) but thou art ca&s;t out of thy grave like an abominable branch</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But although the reward of heroes, in the chri&s;|tian's heaven, be our proper theme on this &s;olemn day; yet the pa&s;&s;ing view which we have taken of the perdition decreed to the traitors of their country, in the Poet's hell, confirmed al&s;o by the voice of &s;cripture, is not foreign to our main purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I know your bo&s;oms glow with &s;o &s;trong an aver&s;ion to all the foes of liberty in this life, that you will &s;urely avoid every thought and action, which might doom you to their company in the life to come; and therefore, bidding adieu&mdash;and may it be an eternal adieu&mdash;to tho&s;e dreary regions and their mi&s;erable inhabitants, let us now exalt our joyous view to tho&s;e cele&s;tial man&s;ions, where the benefactors of mankind reap immortal triumphs!
<Q><L>"Lo! the ble&s;t train advance along the meads,</L>
<L>"And &s;nowy wreaths adorn their glorious heads</L>
<L>"Patriots who peri&s;h'd for their country's right</L>
<L>"Or nobly triumph'd in the field of fight.</L>
<L>"Worthies, who life by u&s;eful arts refin'd,</L>
<L>"With tho&s;e who leave a deathle&s;s name behind</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="015085_0009_0F95A7FD0DE65598">
"Friends of the world, and patrons of mankind,</L>
<L>"Some on the verdant plains are &s;tretch'd along,</L>
<L>"Sweet to the ear, their tuneful Paeans rung.</L></Q></P>
<P>But here, ye Pagan poets, and thou Prince of their choir, we leave you far behind; for your &s;ublime&s;t flights are now infinitely &s;hort of the theme! Your gloomy Theology gave you tolerable aid in forming a Hell, but the utmo&s;t efforts of natural genius could not make a heaven worthy of a rational and immortal &s;oul! The glory of giving &s;ome animating de&s;cription of that bli&s;s "which eye hath not &s;een, nor ear before heard, nor could "the unenlightened heart of man otherwi&s;e con|ceive," was left for a more divine teacher. From him we learn, that a heart pure and detatched from &s;ordid plea&s;ures, a &s;oul panting after perfection, &s;triving to imitate the goodne&s;s of heaven, antici|pating its approving &s;entence, and devoted to the &s;ervice of mankind, &s;hall at la&s;t ri&s;e and mix in eternal fellow&s;hip with the beatified family of God.</P>
<P>Having now, my re&s;pected countrymen&mdash;and I hope I do not weary you&mdash;laid a wide foundation upon the practice of the wi&s;e&s;t nations&mdash;in &s;upport of the pre&s;ent &s;olemnity; I &s;hall add but little more concerning the public utility of the thing it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tanced as we now are, perhaps &s;hall long be, in building up a fabric for future ages, it would be a wi&s;e in&s;titution, if in imitation of the Genoe&s;e 'fea&s;t of union,' we &s;hould make at lea&s;t an annual pau&s;e, for a review of pa&s;t incidents, and of the characters of tho&s;e who have borne an illu&s;|trious &s;hare in them; thereby animating our virtue,
<PB N="11" REF="015085_0010_0F95A7FEC01A36F0">and uniting our&s;elves more clo&s;ely in the bonds of mutual friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The world, in general, is more willing to imi|tate, than to be taught; and examples of eminent characters have a &s;tronger influence than written precepts. Men's actions are a more faithful mirror of their lives than their words. The former &s;eldom deceive; but the latter often. The deeds of old, contract a venerable authority over us, when &s;anc|tified by the voice of applauding ages; and, even in our own day, our hearts take an immediate part with tho&s;e who have nobly triumphed, or greatly &s;uffered in our behalf.</P>
<P>But the more u&s;eful the di&s;play of &s;uch charac|ters may be to the world, the more difficult is the work. And I am not to learn, that of all kinds of writing, panegyric requires the mo&s;t delicate hand. Men &s;eldom endure the prai&s;e of any actions, but tho&s;e which their &s;elf-love repre&s;ents as po&s;&s;ible to them&s;elves. Whatever is held up as an example, if placed beyond the reach of humanity duly exalted by public &s;pirit, will exite no emulation; and whatever is placed within the vulgar walks of life, will attract no attention.</P>
<P>There is a further difficulty, peculiar to certain times; particularly tho&s;e of civil di&s;&s;en&s;ion, when the minds of men are worked into a ferment. Whence it happens, that they who have been the &s;ubjects of obliquy in one age, have become the theme of prai&s;e in another. Such was Hampden&mdash;in the days of pa&s;&s;ive obedience; branded as a &s;edi|tious di&s;turber of his country's peace; and at the ble&s;&s;ed aera of the revolution, exalted into the fir&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="015085_0011_0F95A8002E66A598">rank of patriots. Such was Sidney, condemned to a &s;caffold in the former period; and, in the lat|ter, immortalized by the delegated voice of the nation!</P>
<P>What judgment po&s;terity will form of the pre|&s;ent mighty conte&s;t, in which the&s;e united colo|nies are engaged, I am at no lo&s;s to determine in my own heart. But, while the &s;ame actions are, by one part of a great empire, pronounced the mo&s;t criminal re&s;i&s;tance, and by another, the mo&s;t laud|able efforts of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; no public character can be drawn alike acceptable to all. Neverthe|le&s;s, as the faithful hi&s;torian is the be&s;t panegyri&s;t of true merit, he will not fa&s;hion him&s;elf to times and &s;ea&s;ons, but exalt him&s;elf above them; and, con&s;cious of his dignity, as re&s;pon&s;ible to &s;ucceed|ing ages, will take eternal truth as his &s;upport, which can alone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the impartial te&s;t of future examination. He knows that the divine colors of virtue, although they may give a temporary glare, will not blend or mellow into a ground-work of vice.</P>
<P>Whatever events, di&s;a&s;trous or happy, may lie before us; yet &s;ome degree of applau&s;e, even from an enemy, is certainly due to tho&s;e illu&s;trious men, who, led by con&s;cience and a clear per&s;ua&s;ion of duty, &s;acrifice their ea&s;e, their lives and fortunes to the public; and from their friends and country, they are entitled to a deathle&s;s renown.</P>
<P>Peri&s;h that narrow pride, which will &s;uffer men to acknowledge no virtue, but among their own party. In this direful conte&s;t, the chief concern of a liberal mind, will be, that &s;o much per&s;onal
<PB N="13" REF="015085_0012_0F95A800C75A2FD8">virtue as may be found on both &s;ides, in&s;tead of being united in &s;ome great national point for the common good, &s;hould be dreadfully employed to the purpo&s;e of mutual de&s;truction. And a man can as &s;oon dive&s;t him&s;elf of his humanity, as re|fu&s;e the tribute of veneration, due to actions truly magnanimous.</P>
<P>When once it becomes criminal to plead the cau&s;e of a &s;uffering people; when their virtues can no longer be &s;afely recorded, then tyranny has put the la&s;t hand to her barbarous work. All the va|luable purpo&s;es of &s;ociety are fru&s;trated; and what|ever other human fate remains will be wholly in|different to the wi&s;e and good.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o many who&s;e minds are &s;o little, that they can conceive nothing great, which does not court the eye in all the trappings of dre&s;s, titles, and external &s;plendor. An <HI>American-Patriot!</HI> a <HI>Blanket-Hero!</HI> a <HI>General</HI> from the <HI>plough!</HI> All the&s;e are terms of ridicule and reproach among many. Yet &s;uch was <HI>Cincinnatus,</HI> in the be&s;t days of Roman virtue; and a Briti&s;h poet, already quo|ted, hath boldly taught his countrymen this noble le&s;&s;on:</P>
<Q><L>"Some, with whom compar'd, your in&s;ect-tribes</L>
<L>"Are but the beings of a &s;ummer's day,</L>
<L>"Have held the &s;cale of empire, rul'd the &s;torm</L>
<L>"Of mighty war; then, with unweary'd hand,</L>
<L>"Di&s;daining little delicacies, &s;eiz'd</L>
<L>"The <HI>plough,</HI> and greatly independant liv'd."</L>
<BIBL><HI>THOMPSON.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>The &s;ame noble le&s;&s;on is al&s;o taught, by the well known &s;tory of the two Spani&s;h grandees, who
<PB N="14" REF="015085_0013_0F95A801892D7108">were &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the Hague. Notwith|&s;tanding all the pride of their nation, they did not de&s;pi&s;e the Dutch deputies, when they met them in a plain habit, and &s;aw them on a journey &s;it down upon the gra&s;s, to a frugal repa&s;t of bread and chee&s;e, out of their knap&s;acks. On the con|trary, they cried out, <Q>We &s;hall never be able to conquer the&s;e people; we mu&s;t even make peace with them.</Q></P>
<P>Should amba&s;&s;adors honor us with a vi&s;it, upon a like occa&s;ion; let us be prepared to meet them in the &s;ame maje&s;tic &s;implicity of dre&s;s and man|ners. Let us convince them that public virtue is confined to no cla&s;s of men; and that although it &s;ometimes ba&s;ks in the &s;un&s;hine of courts, it fre|quently lies hid in the &s;hades of ob&s;curity, like the latent fire in flint, till called forth by the collifive hand of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Adver&s;ity is the &s;ea&s;on which &s;hews the &s;pirit of a man in its full vigor; and times of civil calamity never fail to &s;trike forth lights, &s;ometimes &s;ingle, and &s;ometimes whole con&s;tellations, mingling their kindred rays to warm and to illuminate the genius of their country.</P>
<P>The &s;acred flame thus enkindled, is not fed by the fuel of faction or party; but by pure benevo|lence and love of the public. It therefore, &s;oon ri&s;es above the &s;elfi&s;h principles, refines and bright|ens as it ri&s;es, and expands it&s;elf into heavenly di|men&s;ions. Being inextingui&s;hable in its own na|ture, the blood of thou&s;ands on the &s;caffold or in the field, is but as oil poured into a conflagration, encrea&s;ing its vehemence, till it con&s;umes all be|fore
<PB N="15" REF="015085_0014_0F95A8024C93B230">it; burning &s;till clearer and &s;tronger, unto the full day of peace and civil happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who enjoy a true portion of this divine flame, duly called forth into exerci&s;e, &s;tand in no need of further titles or di&s;tinctions, either by birth or grant. For what can the world pre&s;ent greater to the fight of mortals, or even immortals, than a man who knows and courts the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, who wi&s;hes to breathe out his la&s;t in its arms; and, keeping it &s;till as his object, is never|thele&s;s rou&s;ed by the fir&s;t pang of his &s;uffering country; gives his whole illu&s;trious &s;pirit to her re|lief; ri&s;es above all human allurements; never re|mits his zeal; fears nothing; regards nothing, but the &s;entiments which virtue and magnanimity in|&s;pire? What higher qualities can be required to entitle a man to the veneration and eulogies of his country? And the&s;e too will be his mo&s;t durable monument.</P>
<P>The magnificent &s;tructures rai&s;ed by the grati|tude of mankind to their benefactors of old, had but a local and temporary u&s;e. They were be|held only by one people, and for a few ages.</P>
<Q><L>"The Heaven a&s;piring pyramid, the proud</L>
<L>"Triumphal arch, and all that e'er upheld</L>
<L>"The wor&s;hipp'd name of hoar antiquity</L>

<P>"Remember, thou art this day going to addre&s;s men born in the arms of liberty, Grecians, Athe|nians!" &mdash;Let no thought enter thy heart&mdash;let no word fall from thy tongue, unworthy of &s;uch an audience!</P>
<P>As to that hero, who&s;e memory you celebrate as a <HI>Proto-Martyr</HI> to your rights, for through whatever fields I have &s;trayed, he has never e&s;|caped my view, as to him I &s;ay, if any thing hu|man could now reach his ear, nothing but the great concerns of virtue, liberty, truth and ju&s;tice would be tolerable to him; for to the&s;e was his life devoted, from his early years.</P>
<P>He had received a liberal education in Ireland, his native country, before he went into the army; and was indeed endued with talents which would have led him to eminence in any profe&s;&s;ion. His own he &s;tudied with a folicity which &s;oon di&s;tin|gui&s;hed his military abilities; but war and conque&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="015085_0017_0F95A805B5A5FE58">having no other charms to him than as the nece&s;&s;a|ry means of peace and happine&s;s, to mankind; he &s;till found lei&s;ure, in the mid&s;t of camps, to culti|vate an excellent ta&s;te for philo&s;ophy, and polite literature. To the&s;e he added a careful &s;tudy of the arts of government, and the rights of man|kind, looking forward to that time, when he might de&s;cend into the <HI>&s;till &s;cenes</HI> of private life; and give a full flow to the native and acquired vir|tues of a heart rich in moral excellence.</P>
<P>Above eighteen years ago he had attained the rank of Captain in the 17th regiment, under Ge|neral Monckton, and &s;tood full in the way of higher preferment; having borne a &s;hare in all the labors of our American wars, and the reduction of Canada. Ill-fated region! &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals! Little did he fore&s;ee the &s;cenes which that land had &s;till in re&s;erve for him! Little did tho&s;e generous Americans, who then &s;tood by his &s;ide, think that they were a&s;&s;i&s;ting to &s;ubdue a country, which would one day be held up over us, as a greater &s;courge in the hands of friends, than ever it was in the hands of enemies!</P>
<P>Had &s;uch a thought then entered our hearts, we &s;hould have &s;tarted with indignation from the deed of horror. Our heroi&s;m would have appeared madne&s;s and parricide! The lifted &s;teel would have dropped from the warrior's arm! The axe and the hoe from the warrior's arm! The axe and the hoe from the laborer's gra&s;p! America would have weeped through all her fore&s;ts; and her well-cultivated fields refu&s;ed to yield farther &s;u&s;tenance to her infatuated &s;ons!</P>
<P>But far different were our thoughts at that time.
<PB N="19" REF="015085_0018_0F95A8091B83BF38">We con&s;idered our&s;elves as co-operating with our brethren, for the glory of the empire; to enable them to &s;ecure our common peace and liberty; to humanize, adorn, and dignify, with Briti&s;h privi|leges, a va&s;t continent; to become &s;trong in our &s;trength, happy in our happine&s;s; and to derive that from our affection, which no force can extort from a free people; and which the mi&s;erable and oppre&s;&s;ed cannot give!</P>
<P>And the&s;e, too, were the &s;entiments of our la|mented Hero; for he had formed an early attach|ment, amounting even to an enthu&s;ia&s;tic love for this country! The woodland and the plain; the face of nature, grand, venerable, and yet rejoicing in her prime; our mighty rivers, de&s;cending in va&s;t cataracts through wild and &s;haggy mountains, or gliding in &s;ilent maje&s;ty through fertile vales; their numerous branches and tributary &s;prings; our romantic &s;cenes of rural quiet; our &s;implicity of manners, yet uncorrupted by luxury or flagrant vice; our love of knowlege and ardor of liberty, all the&s;e &s;erved to convey the idea of primaeval fe|licity to a heart which he had taught to beat uni|&s;on with the harmony of Heaven!</P>
<P>He therefore cho&s;e America, as the field of his future u&s;efulne&s;s; and as &s;oon as the ble&s;&s;ings of peace were re&s;tored to his country, and duty to his &s;overeign would permit, he took his leave of the army, and having &s;oon connected him&s;elf, by marriage, with an ancient and honorable family, in the province of New-York, he cho&s;e a delight|ful retirement upon the banks of Hud&s;on's river, at a di&s;tance from the noi&s;e of the bu&s;y world!&mdash;

Nor from that happy &s;pot did he wi&s;h to &s;tray, until he &s;hould receive his la&s;t &s;ummons to happine&s;s, more than terre&s;tial.</P>
<P>But when the hand of power was &s;tretched forth again&s;t the land of his re&s;idence, he had a heart too noble not to &s;ympathize in its di&s;tre&s;s.

<P>Although his liberal &s;pirit placed him above lo|cal prejudices, and he con&s;idered him&s;elf as a member of the empire at large; yet America, &s;truggling in the cau&s;e of liberty, henceforth be|came

Worth like his, could be no longer hid in the &s;hades of ob&s;curity; nor permit him to be placed in that in|ferior &s;tation with which a mind, great in humility and &s;elf denial, would have been contented. It was wi&s;ely con&s;idered, that he, who had &s;o well learned to obey, was fitte&s;t to command; and therefore, being well a&s;&s;ured of his own heart, he re&s;igned him&s;elf to the public voice, nor he&s;itated a moment longer to accept the important commi&s;|&s;ion freely offered to him, and, with the firmne&s;s of another Regulus, to bid farewell to his peaceful retirement, and dome&s;tic endearments.</P>

"I COME, I come!" Nor were the&s;e the words of di&s;appointed ambition; nor dictated by any &s;udden &s;tart of party zeal. He had weigh|ed the conte&s;t well, was intimately acquainted with the unalienable rights of freemen, and ready to &s;upport them at every peril! He had long fore|&s;een and lamented the fatal i&s;&s;ue to which things were ha&s;tening. He knew that the &s;word of civil de&s;truction, once drawn, is not ea&s;ily &s;heathed; that men having their minds inflamed and the wea|pons of defence in their hands, &s;eldom know the ju&s;t point where to &s;top, even when they have it in their power; and often proceed to actions, the bare contemplation of which would at fir&s;t have a&s;toni&s;hed them.</P>
<P>It was therefore his de&s;ire rather to &s;often than enflame violent humors, wi&s;hing that America, in all her actions, might &s;tand ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God, and the world. He fore&s;aw the horrid train of evils which would be let loo&s;e by the &s;troke which &s;hould &s;ever the ancient bond of union be|tween Great-Britain and us. It was therefore his wi&s;h, that &s;uch a &s;troke &s;hould never proceed fir&s;t from the hand of America. Nor did it &s;o pro|ceed.</P>
<P>The re&s;i&s;tance made at Lexington, was not the traiterous act of men con&s;piring again&s;t the &s;upreme powers; nor directed by the councils of any public body in America; but ro&s;e immediately out of the ca&s;e, and was dictated by &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, the fir&s;t great law of nature as well as &s;ociety. If there was any premeditated &s;cheme here, it was preme|ditated by tho&s;e who created the dreadful nece&s;&s;ity,

<P>Was this an experiment worthy of Great-Britain? Where was the wi&s;dom of her coun&s;ellors? Had their ju&s;tice, their moderation quite for&s;aken them? Could they po&s;&s;ibly expect obedience in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this? Would they them&s;elves, in a &s;imilar ca&s;e, even under a competent legi&s;lative authority, &s;ubmit to laws which would de&s;troy the great end of all laws, Self-Pre&s;ervation? Human nature &s;ays, No; The Genius of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution &s;ays, No. The nation it&s;elf hath heretofore &s;aid, No; and a great oracle <HI>(black&s;tone)</HI> of its laws has given his &s;anction to the verdict&mdash; <Q>In ca&s;es of national oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;ays he, the nation hath very ju&s;tifi|ably ri&s;en as one man, to vindicate the original contract, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between King and people.</Q> And&mdash;<Q>If the &s;overeign power threatens de&s;o|lation to a &s;tate, mankind will not be rea&s;oned out of the feelings of humanity, nor &s;acrifice liberty to a &s;crupulous adherence to political maxims.</Q></P>
<P>If the ca&s;e of America does not come within the above de&s;cription, there &s;eems to be no equity left upon earth; and whatever is exacted by force, mu&s;t be yielded through fear. But if ju&s;tice be any thing more than a name, it is &s;urely a &s;oleci&s;m in politics to &s;ay, that one part of a free country has a right to command that which the other <Q>cannot obey without being &s;laves, nor re&s;i&s;t with|out
<PB N="24" REF="015085_0023_0F95A80E414BE4D8">being rebels.</Q> Yet to &s;uch a &s;ad dilemma does the parliamentary claim of a right to bind us "in all ca&s;es what&s;oever," reduce America; involv|ing it in a total &s;urrender of our liberties; &s;uper|&s;eding the u&s;e of our own legi&s;latures; marking us with &s;uch a badge of &s;ervitude as no freemen can con&s;ent to wear; and &s;ubjecting us to burdens laid by tho&s;e who are not only unacquainted with our circum&s;tances, and bear no part of the weight, but ca&s;e them&s;elves in proportion as they load us. If this be law, if it be equity, it has no example among any other people, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t glim|merings of virtue or native freedom.</P>
<P>But although this claim be &s;o repugnant to every idea of natural as well as legal ju&s;tice, that the guilt of blood which it may occa&s;ion can be charge|able only on tho&s;e who attempt to enforce it; yet I am well a&s;&s;ured that when compelled at la&s;t by hard nece&s;&s;ity, either to avert the dagger pointed at our brea&s;t or crouch to unconditional &s;ervitude, our hero's heart bled for the dreadful alternative.</P>
<P>His principles of loyalty to his &s;overeign [whom he had long &s;erved, and who&s;e true glory con&s;i&s;ts in healing tho&s;e &s;treaming wounds] remained firm and un&s;haken. Love to our brethren whom we mu&s;t oppo&s;e the interchange of good offices, which had &s;o intimately knit the bonds of friend|&s;hip between them and us; the memory of tho&s;e better days, in which we fought and triumphed to|gether; the va&s;t fabric of mutual happine&s;s rai&s;ed by our union, and ready to be di&s;&s;olved by our di&s;&s;entions; the annihilation of tho&s;e numerous plans of improvement in which we were engaged
<PB N="25" REF="015085_0024_0F95A80F0E35B200">for the glory of the empire; all the&s;e con&s;iderati|ons con&s;pired to render this conte&s;t peculiarly ab|horrent to him, and every virtuous American, and could have been outweighed by nothing earthly, but the unquenchable love of liberty, and that &s;a|cred duty which we owe to our&s;elves and our po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>Hence, as appears from his papers, even in the full triumph of &s;ucce&s;s, he mo&s;t ardently joined his worthy friend, General Schuyler, in praying that <Q>Heaven may &s;peedily re-unite us in every bond of affection and intere&s;t; and that the Briti&s;h empire may again become the envy and admi|ration of the univer&s;e, and flouri&s;h</Q> till the con|&s;ummation of earthly things.</P>
<P>This part of his character, I dwell upon with particular &s;atisfaction; and indeed had he evidenced a contrary &s;entiment, or gone forth in the rage of conque&s;t in&s;tead of the &s;pirit of reconciliation; not all his other virtues, nor yet the re&s;pect which I owe to the appointment wherewith I am now ho|nored, could have induced me to appear in this place, on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>God forbid that any of the profe&s;&s;ion to which I belong, &s;hould ever forget their peculiar charac|ter, exerci&s;e a turbulent &s;pirit, or pro&s;titute their voice to en&s;lave men's minds to the purpo&s;es of wild ambition, or mutual de&s;truction. I am hap|py in knowing that nothing of this kind is wi&s;hed from me; nay, that the delegated voice of the continent, as well as of this particular province, &s;upports me in praying for a re&s;toration <Q>of the former harmony between Great-Britain, and
<PB N="26" REF="015085_0025_0F95A8124C240458">the&s;e colonies upon &s;o firm a ba&s;is as to perpetu|ate its ble&s;&s;ings, uninterupted by any future di&s;|&s;entions, to &s;ucceeding generations in both coun|tries.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed this matter re&s;ts in &s;afe hands, and is clear in it&s;elf. If redre&s;s of grievances, e&s;&s;ential liberty, and &s;ecurity again&s;t future oppre&s;&s;ion can be obtained, agreeable to our own de&s;ires; then, neither con&s;i&s;tency, dignity, or a regard to our il|lu&s;trious Briti&s;h friends, who have defended our cau&s;e, pledged them&s;elves for our &s;incerity, and hope by our aid to re&s;tore and perpetuate the glory of the whole empire, can &s;uffer us to he&s;itate. To &s;ay, let them look to their own &s;afety, and we will look to ours, would be unworthy of the libe|ral &s;oul of any American, truly animated in our pre&s;ent cau&s;e, and with the love of univer&s;al li|berty.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e terms cannot be obtained?&mdash; Why then, there will be no need of further argu|ments, much le&s;s of aggravations. Timid as my heart, perhaps is, and ill-tuned as my ear may be to the din of arms, and the clangor of the trumpet; yet, in that ca&s;e, &s;ounds which are a thou&s;and times more har&s;h; "even the croaking of frogs in the uncultivated fen," or the howling of wild bea&s;ts on the mountain top, where liberty dwells, would be "preferable to the Nightingale's &s;ong," in vales of &s;lavery, or the melting notes of Corelli, in cities clanking their chains!</P>
<P>If this be a digre&s;&s;ion, pardon it as the la&s;t, and due to my own principles and con&s;i&s;tency. I now ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">en to attend our hero through the remainder<GAP DESC="missing">

<P>The Canada expedition is one of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which the enemies of American peace having fir&s;t rendered nece&s;&s;ary, will now &s;trive to mi&s;con&s;true into ho&s;tility and offence. But when authentic proofs were obtained that a people profe&s;&s;ing a re|ligion, and &s;ubjected to laws, different from ours, together with numerous tribes of &s;avages were in|&s;tigated and preparing to deluge our frontiers in blood, let God and the world judge whether it was an act of offence; or rather, whether it was not mercy to them, to our&s;elves, to the whole Briti&s;h empire, to u&s;e the means in our power for fru&s;|trating the barbarous attempt.</P>
<P>Indeed there was benevolence in the whole plan of his expedition. It was to be executed not &s;o much by force as by per&s;ua&s;ion; and appearing in the country with &s;uch a re&s;pectable &s;trength, as might protect the inhabitants from the in&s;ults and vengeace of tho&s;e, who were &s;triving to make them li&s;t up their reluctant arm to the &s;hedding fraternal blood. It was further wi&s;hed to kindle up the ex|piring lamp of liberty among them; to open their eyes to its divine effulgence; and enable them to rai&s;e their drooping head, and claim its ble&s;&s;ing as their own.</P>
<P>This was a work, in all its parts, &s;uited to the genius of a Montgomery. He had a head and heart which equally pointed him out as a fit guide in &s;uch an undertaking. He under&s;tood and could well explain the ble&s;&s;ings of a free government
<PB N="28" REF="015085_0027_0F95A819892998A8">Per&s;ua&s;ion dwelt upon his tongue.

<P>But &s;till, with a few new rai&s;ed men, of different colonies, and perhaps different tempers; ill &s;up|plied with arms and ammunition; wor&s;e di&s;ciplined; unaccu&s;tomed to look cannon in the face; to make or to mount a breach&mdash;in &s;uch circum&s;tances, I &s;ay, and in the &s;hort &s;pace of an autumnal and win|ter campaign, in rigorous northern climes, to at|chieve a work which co&s;t Great-Britain and the colonies the labor of &s;everal campaigns, and what was a &s;acrifice of infinitely more value&mdash;the life of the immortal WOLFE&mdash;this certainly required a degree of magnanimity beyond the ordinary reach, and the exertion of the highe&s;t abilities of every kind.</P>
<P>The command and conduct of an army, were but &s;mall parts of this undertaking. The Indians were to be treated with, re&s;trained and kept in temper.

Should things not go well, I tremble for the fate of the poor Canadians, who have ventured &s;o much. What &s;hall I do with them, &s;hould I be obliged to evacuate this country? I have a&s;&s;ured them that the United Colonies will as &s;oon give up Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts to re&s;entment as them."</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments were worthy of a heroic &s;oul, and of the faith he had pledged to tho&s;e people.
<PB N="30" REF="015085_0029_0F95A81BC1D92118">Nor is he le&s;s to be venerated for his tender regard towards his own army. In&s;tead of making a merit of his difficulties (which were indeed more than ought to be mentioned in this place) he often &s;eeks to conceal them; a&s;cribing any little faults or tar|dine&s;s, in his young troops, to their want of expe|rience in forming; to their hard duty, the con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bad weather and the like&mdash;&s;till en|couraging them to nobler efforts in future. And if any impatience of di&s;cipline appeared, he nobly attributed it to <Q>that &s;pirit of freedom, which men accu&s;tomed to think for them&s;elves, will even bring into camps with them.</Q></P>
<P>His own &s;uperior military knowledge he has been known to &s;acrifice to the general voice, rather than interrupt that union on which &s;ucce&s;s depend|ed; and when a mea&s;ure was once re&s;olved upon by the majority, however much contrary to his own advice and judgment, he magnanimou&s;ly &s;up|ported it with his utmo&s;t vigor; di&s;daining that work of low ambition, which will &s;trive to defeat in the execution what it could not direct in planing</P>
<P>His per&s;erverance and conduct in gaining po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of St. John's and Montreal, have already been the theme of every tongue, and need not be mentioned in this place. His abilities in negociation the preci&s;ion with which the various articles o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> treaties and capitulations are expre&s;&s;ed; the gene|rous applau&s;e he gives, not only to every worth effort of his own officers, but to the Commanding Officer and garri&s;on of St. John's; his noble decla|ration to the inhabitants of Montreal, <Q>that the Continental Armies de&s;pi&s;e every act of oppre&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="31" REF="015085_0030_0F95A81E033ABC88" MS="y">and violence, being come for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of giving liberty and &s;ecurity</Q> &mdash; all the&s;e I &s;ay, did honor to him&s;elf, and to that delegated body, under who&s;e authority he acted.</P>
<P>Leaving him, therefore for a while&mdash;alas too &s;hort a while&mdash;to enjoy the noble&s;t of all triumphs, the applau&s;e of his country, and the con&s;cious te&s;|timony of his own heart, let us enquire after another band of brave and hardy men who are &s;temming rapid rivers, a&s;cending pathle&s;s mountains; tra|ver&s;ing unpeopled de&s;erts; and ha&s;tening through deep mora&s;&s;es and gloomy woods to meet him in &s;cenes of another i&s;&s;ue&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;De&s;erts in vain</L>
<L>Oppos'd their cour&s;e, and deep rapacious floods,</L>
<L>And mountains in who&s;e jaws de&s;truction grin'd,</L>
<L>Hunger and toil&mdash;Armenian &s;nows and &s;torms;</L>
<L>Greece in their view and glory yet untouch'd,</L>
<L>They held their fearle&s;s way&mdash;O! &s;trength of mind</L>
<L>Almo&s;t almighty in &s;evere extremes!</L></Q>
<P>This prai&s;e was paid to ten thou&s;and heroes, &s;u&s;|taining every danger, in a retreat to their own coun|try, and is certainly due, &s;o far as heroi&s;m is con|cerned, to le&s;s than a tenth part of the number, marching through equal difficulties again&s;t the ca|pital of a ho&s;tile country.</P>
<P>Even the march of Hannibal over the Alps, &s;o much celebrated in hi&s;tory, allowing for the di&s;|parity of numbers, has nothing in it of &s;uperior merit, to the march of Arnold; and in many cir|cum&s;tances there is a mo&s;t &s;triking &s;imilitude.</P>
<P>The former had to encounter the rapid Kenne|beck, thro' an immen&s;e length of country. The
<PB N="32" REF="015085_0031_0F95A81EC06C1010">former when he came to quit the river, found his further pa&s;&s;age barr'd by mountains, rearing their &s;nowy cre&s;ts to the &s;ky, rugged, wild, uncultivated. This was al&s;o the ca&s;e with the latter, who&s;e troops, carrying their boats and baggage, were obliged to cro&s;s and recro&s;s the &s;ame mountains &s;undry times. At the foot of the mountains, the former was de&s;erted by three thou&s;and of his army, de&s;ponding at the length of the way, and ter|rified at the hideous view of tho&s;e &s;tupendous heights, which they con&s;idered as impa&s;&s;able&mdash;In like circum&s;tances, about a third part of the army of the latter, de&s;erted &s;hall I &s;ay, or u&s;e the more courteous language "returned home." The march of the former was about twelve hundred miles in five months. The Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania rifle-companies, belonging to the latter, including their fir&s;t march from their own habitations to Cam|bridge, and thence to Quebec, marched near the &s;ame di&s;tance in about three months.</P>
<P><HI>Be&s;ides the&s;e rifle companies, Arnold's corps con&s;i&s;ted of about 500 New England troops, who &s;u&s;tained all the fatigues of the wor&s;t part of the march by land and water, with the utmo&s;t fortitude. And General Mont|gomery, ever ready to do ju&s;tice to merit, having joined them before Quebec, gives their commander and them this character.</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>They are an exceeding fine body of men, inured to fatigue, with a &s;tyle of di&s;cipline among them much &s;uperior to what I have been u&s;ed to &s;ee this cam|paign. He him&s;elf is active, intelligent, and enterprizing,</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Having approached tho&s;e plains which the blood of

The &s;ituation of his army pre&s;&s;ed di&s;patch! Snows and fro&s;ts only quickened his motions. He hoped by one &s;uccesful &s;troke, before the arrival of &s;uccours to the garri&s;on, to compleat his plan, and &s;ave the future effu&s;ion of much blood. He further flattered him&s;elf, that his &s;ucce&s;s, if &s;peedy, might have &s;ome influence upon Parliament, in ha&s;tening a reconciliation. He under&s;tood that maxim of Folard&mdash;"No ob&s;tacle &s;hould break our re&s;olution, when there is but a moment be|tween a bad &s;ituation and a wor&s;e"&mdash;This &s;entiment he expre&s;&s;es in his la&s;t letter, with a &s;pirit of mode&s;ty, and a &s;en&s;e of duty, as well as the danger attending it, which ought to be forever recorded to his glory. <Q>I &s;hall be &s;orry to be reduced to this mode of attack; becau&s;e I know the melancholy con&s;equences. But the approaching &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on, the weakne&s;s of the garri&s;on, together with the nature of the works, point it out too &s;trong to be pa&s;&s;ed by. For|tune often baffles the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of poor mortals&mdash;I am not intoxicated with the favours I have received at her hands. But I think there is a fair pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</Q></HI></P>
<P><HI>Poor mortals indeed, if nothing was to remain of them after death; for while he was courting this &s;uc|ce&s;s, and gloriou&s;ly leading on his troops in the front of danger, he received the fatal &s;troke, which in an in&s;tant relea&s;ed his great &s;pirit, to follow and join the immortal &s;pirit of WOLFE!</HI></P>
<P><HI>O thou &s;wift winged me&s;&s;enger of de&s;truction, how did&s;t thou triumph in that moment! the &s;troke that &s;ever'd Montgomery from his army, deprived them of
<PB N="34" REF="015085_0033_0F95A822D53682F0">more than a member.

<P>Here, ye Penn&s;ylvanian youths, &s;econd to none in virtue, let a portion of your tears be &s;acred to the manes of Macpher&s;on! You remember his generous &s;pirit in his early years, for they drank of the &s;ame &s;prings of &s;cience with many of you now before me; and we who reached the cup to yon lip, rejoice that it contributed to invigorate both him and you into wi&s;dom and public &s;pirit. Hav|ing fini&s;hed his &s;cola&s;tic education, he &s;tudied the laws of his country, under a lawyer and a patriot of di&s;tingui&s;hed name; and animated by his exam|ple, as well as precepts, had become eminent in his profe&s;&s;ion, at an age when &s;ome have &s;carce begun to think of bu&s;ine&s;s. The love of liberty being his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, he thought it his duty in the pre&s;ent &s;truggle, to offer him&s;elf to the &s;ervice of his country, and he had &s;oon an opportunity of attaining that military pre-eminence, of which he was laudably ambitious.</P>
<P>Enjoying a hereditary bravery, joined to a well cultivated under&s;tanding, and an active &s;pirit, he &s;oon became the bo&s;om friend of General Montgo|mery, was his Aid de camp, was entru&s;ted with a &s;hare in the management of his mo&s;t important ne|gociations,
<PB N="35" REF="015085_0034_0F95A82344235F38">&s;tood by his &s;ide in the attack upon Quebec, and being, as it were, animated by one common &s;oul, and dear to each other in life&mdash;in death, they were not a moment divided!</P>
<P>Here likewi&s;e fell Captain Chee&s;man, of the New-York forces, covered with honor, and la|mented by all who knew him, as an active and gallant officer. His paticular merits, as well as the merits of &s;ome others, who &s;hared his fate, ought to be more fully commemorated on this occa&s;ion, if proper accounts of them could be collected.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not, however, omit the name of the brave Captain Hendricks, who commanded one of the Penn&s;ylvania rifle companies, and was known to me from his infancy. He was indeed prodigal of his life, and courted danger out of his tour of duty. The command of the guard belonged to him, on the morning of the attak; but he &s;olicit|ed and obtained leave to make a more con&s;picuous po&s;t; and having led his men through the barrier, where his commanding officer, General Arnold, was wounded, he long &s;u&s;tained the fire of the garri&s;on with un&s;haken firmn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> receiv|ing a &s;hot in his brea&s;t, he immediately expired.</P>
<P>Such examples of magnanimity, filled even ad|ver&s;aries with veneration and e&s;teem. Forgetting the foes in the heroes, they gathered up their breathle&s;s remains, and committed them to kindred du&s;t, with pious hands, "and funeral honors meet." So may your own remains, and particularly thine, O Carlton, be honored, &s;hould it ever be your fate to fall in ho&s;tile fields! Or if amid the various chances of war, your lot &s;hould be among the pri|&s;oners
<PB N="36" REF="015085_0035_0F95A825C07051E8" MS="y">and the wounded, may you be di&s;tingui&s;hed with an ample return of that benevolence which you have &s;hewn to others. Such offices of huma|nity, &s;oftening the &s;avage &s;cenes of war, will en|title you to an honor which all the pride of con|que&s;t cannot be&s;tow, much le&s;s a conque&s;t over fellow &s;ubjects, contending for the common rights of freemen.</P>
<P>Having now paid the honours due to the me|mories of our departed friends, what need I add more? Illu&s;trious, although &s;hort, was their race! "But old age is not that which &s;tandeth in length of time, nor is mea&s;ured by number of years&mdash;wi&s;dom is the grey hair to man, and an un&s;potted life is old age."</P>
<P>To &s;uch men, Rome in all her glory would have decreed honors; and the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, to tran&s;mit the memory of their virtues, is worthy of that magnanimity which ought to characterize pub|lic bodies. Jealous and arbitrary rulers are &s;paring of honors to tho&s;e who &s;erve them, le&s;t their own &s;hould be thus eclip&s;ed. But your lu&s;tre, gentle|men, can &s;uffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> dimunition this way; and the glory you ju&s;tly be&s;tow upon others, will only be reflected to encrea&s;e your own!</P>
