<P>Therefore we conclude, that a Man is ju&s;tified by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT is as fooli&s;h and fatal as it is common, for Mankind, in general, to go on con|tentedly and &s;ecurely, if they have but an outward Reformation; without Examining their State towards God, and the Princi|ples of their Action.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, that Men's Actions &s;hould be &s;piritually good, when their State towards GOD, and the Springs of their Action, are bad? What can an unju&s;tify'd Per&s;on do who is an Enemy to GOD, that &s;hall be acceptable to the God he hates? Can tho&s;e that are in the Fle&s;h plea&s;e God? No, &s;urely! Is it not the Prac|tice of wi&s;e Builders to lay the Foundation fir&s;t? But, alas! the very Contrary is the common Cour&s;e of the World. They &s;uppo&s;e, without Examination and Rea&s;on, that their Foundation is good; and &s;o vainly attempt to build upon the Sand. They carefully &s;trive from time to time to mend and patch their Practices; and if they can get that done, they are ea&s;y in the appa|rent Cleanne&s;s of the out&s;ide of the Cup and Platter; altho' they know nothing of getting into a new State by Ju&s;tification, or of obtaining new Principles by Regeneration.</P>
<P>It is for a Lamentation, that the mo&s;t of People be|gin at the wrong End of Religion; they attempt to grow in Grace, before they get Grace, and to bring forth living Fruit, before they have a living Principle.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004824_0003_100DF86B77FF4808">
O! how hard is it to call fooli&s;h Sinners back from their empty, airy Fabricks, to an impartial Tryal of their States and Principles, that they may lay a firm Foundation that will &s;tand all Weathers; without which all their wild Grapes, and dead Performances will but &s;erve with the greater Ea&s;e and Magnificence to lead their deluded Souls into everla&s;ting Burnings. No doubt, it is their Ignorance and love of Re&s;t which make them &s;o aver&s;e to examine their States; which is notwith&s;tanding of &s;uch va&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>To promote this, I have therefore determined to di&s;|cour&s;e at this Time upon Ju&s;tification; which, as <HI>Luther</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <HI>Is the Article of a &s;tanding or falling Church:</HI> It is undoubtedly a fundamental Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion; For, <HI>no other Foundation can any Man lay, &s;ave that which is laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> This, the Apo&s;tle, after a long Train of clo&s;e Rea&s;on|ing, concludes to be <HI>by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law, i. e.</HI> by Faith, as an In&s;trument applying the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to the Soul; for which alone the Sinner is ju&s;tified, without any Mixture of our Obedience to the moral Law join'd with it, as a de&s;er|ving Cau&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>But, to make this more plain, I would di&s;cour&s;e upon the two following Heads, <HI>namely:</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>I would endeavour to open the Nature of Ju&s;tifi|cation.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Prove that it cannot be by the Works of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>The</P>
<P N="1">I. GENERAL HEAD to be &s;poken upon, is, to open the Nature of Ju&s;tification: Here let it be ob&s;erved, That Ju&s;tification is derived from two Words which &s;ignify to <HI>make Ju&s;t.</HI> Now, he is Ju&s;t, who is free from the Guilt of any Crime (whereby Right is violated) and &s;o de&s;erves not to be puni&s;hed; and to <HI>make Ju&s;t</HI> or <HI>Righteous,</HI> is either by infu&s;ing Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as was done to our fir&s;t Parents at their Creation; or by ab|&s;olving
<PB N="5" REF="004824_0004_100DF86DA0DF67C0">or declaring to free one from the Puni&s;hment due for Sin. It is in this la&s;t Sen&s;e the Word is ge|nerally taken in Scripture: It alludes to Per&s;ons ar|raign'd at a civil Court, who, upon Hearing of their Ca&s;e, are acquitted, by rea&s;on of another's Di&s;charg|ing their Debt for them. Ju&s;tification is diametrically oppo&s;ed to Condemnation, and may be &s;aid to be three fold, <HI>viz.</HI> In the Sight of GOD, Con&s;cience, and Man. Ju&s;tification in the Sight of God, may be thus de&s;cribed, namely, <HI>That it is a Declaration of God's pure Grace, whereby, upon the Account of the Obedience and Sufferings of Chri&s;t, imputed and received by Faith, he frees Per&s;ons from the Guilt of Sin, and gives them a Right to eternal Salvation.</HI> Ju&s;tification in the Sight of Con&s;cience, is the Sen&s;e or Knowledge of being ju&s;tified before God; which u&s;ually follows the Exerci&s;e of a Saving Faith. Hence the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, That <HI>we have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to fear; but the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</HI> Ju&s;tification before Man, con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;piritual Fruits of Faith appearing in our Practice; which evidence to others the Reality of our Ju&s;tification before God. In this Sen&s;e the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> a&s;&s;erts a Man to be ju&s;ti|fied by Works, and de&s;ired tho&s;e who profe&s;s'd Faith, to &s;hew it by their Works. And thus is the &s;eeming Diffe|rence between the two Apo&s;tles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James</HI> removed; the former &s;peaks only of Ju&s;tification before God, while the latter &s;peaks of a Ju&s;tification before Man. It may be al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the&s;e Apo&s;tles had to deal with very different Sorts of People, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;trict Phari&s;ees and loo&s;e Libertines; while the former depended upon their &s;trict Obedience for Acceptance with God, the latter depended on a Faith which did not produce Obe|dience. Now, as it was nece&s;&s;ary to drive the <HI>Phari|&s;ees</HI> from a carnal Dependance upon Works, that &s;o with Poverty of Spirit they might receive and re&s;t up|on the Redeemer, &s;o it was nece&s;&s;ary to convince the
<PB N="6" REF="004824_0005_100DF86FBB90E2D8">Libertines that their Faith was not Ju&s;tifying, becau&s;e it did not produce good Fruits, that &s;o they might be humbled before God, and with Importunity implore his Favour.</P>
<P>But it is Ju&s;tification before God of which the Text under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration treats, this therefore the pre&s;ent Argument concerns; which is, as was be|fore de&s;cribed, <HI>viz.</HI> a gracious Declaration of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>God alone is the Author of Ju&s;tification, and that under the Con&s;ideration of a Supream Lord, Law|giver, Judge and Creditor, whom by Sin we have of|fended, to whom, by Sin, we are become Debtors, and who therefore can only di&s;&s;olve our Obligation to Puni&s;hment. It is he alone, who, in infinite Wi&s;dom, devi&s;ed the Scene of Salvation for fallen Mankind, which the Go&s;pel reveals. It is he, who has, in infinite Love, provided a Surety for Sinners, qualified him for this Work, and accepted his Accompli&s;hment of it up|on their Account. And, it is he, who unites tho&s;e that are to be ju&s;tified, to the Mediator; as well as imputes his Righteou&s;ne&s;s to them for their Acceptance. Now, God the Father does not only concur in the Ju&s;tifica|tion of a Sinner, as has been ob&s;erved; but al&s;o the Son of God concurs by Satisfying as a Sacrifice, and Interceeding as an Advocate; and likewi&s;e, the Holy Spirit, by his te&s;tifying and &s;ealing Influences.</P>
<P>JUSTIFICATION, in its Nature, may be called a Declaration of Almighty God, or judicial Pronounc|ing of Sentence
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 33, 34.</NOTE> which was, as it were, conceived in the Mind of God from Eternity, by the Decree of Ju&s;tification

<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 17.</NOTE> but more &s;en&s;ibly and &s;atisfactorily in the Con&s;cience, upon the Exerci&s;e of Faith in Chri&s;t; e&s;pecially when the Holy Spirit te&s;|tifies with ours, that we are the Sons of God. By
<PB N="7" REF="004824_0006_100DF8718455A268">Faith we know we are ju&s;tified, according to the divine Promi&s;e:

<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Joh.</HI> iii. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the mean Time, the afore&s;aid Declaration is en|tirely gracious in re&s;pect of us: It &s;prings from the pure unexcited Goodne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed God; No inhe|rent Righteou&s;ne&s;s in us, or good Work done by us, bears the lea&s;t Part in our Ju&s;tification; for <HI>we have all &s;inned and come &s;hort of the Glory of God.</HI> The &s;ame pure Grace that gave a Redeemer to the World, and calls the Elect to embrace him, pronounces tho&s;e Righ|teous who are by Faith united to him: For what is our Ju&s;tification but a Blotting out of our Iniquities, a Forgiving and Hiding of our Sins

The Freene&s;s of the Divine Goodne&s;s in his Dealings with Sinners is mo&s;t nobly repre&s;ented by the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> where he compares Man in his natural State to a new-born In|fant lying in the open Field in its Blood, equally ex|po&s;ed to Loathing and to Ruin.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>this,</HI> even <HI>this,</HI> be a&s;toni&s;hed O Heavens! is a Time of <HI>Love,</HI> a Time when the great Lord of the Univer&s;e &s;preads the Spirit of his conde&s;cending Kind|ne&s;s over us, and &s;ays to us, <HI>Live.</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed God, how pure is thy Mercy, and how well worthy of our Su|pream Regards! But tho' they be Sinners whom God ju&s;tifies, yet are they elected, redeemed, called, regene|rated and believing Ones.
<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 30. <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 24. <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>Here it will be proper to enquire, what that Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s is for which a Sinner is ju&s;tified before God? Seeing the Judge of all the Earth mu&s;t needs do right, and that his Judgments are ju&s;t and true, it will ne|ce&s;&s;arily
<PB N="8" REF="004824_0007_100DF873A3AB39C0">follow, that he cannot pronounce tho&s;e Righ|teous who have no Righteou&s;ne&s;s at all in any Sen&s;e. And &s;eeing that the Per&s;on to be ju&s;tified is in him&s;elf ungodly, having no inward Righteou&s;ne&s;s for which he can be ju&s;tified, it is therefore ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that another's Righteou&s;ne&s;s intervene, for which the Sin|ner may be pronounc'd Righteous. But the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of no meer Creature can intervene; becau&s;e every one of them owes it (by Virtue of Creation) as a Debt to God, from whom he has received his Being and all his Benefits.</P>
<P>The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t therefore alone remains, as the de&s;erving Cau&s;e of a Sinner's Ju&s;tification before God: Hence he is &s;aid to be made Sin, for us, who knew no Sin (<HI>i. e.</HI> by Imputation) that in like Manner we might be made the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him: He is called, <HI>The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of One, the free Gift is &s;aid to come upon all Men (<HI>i. e.</HI> all Believers) unto Ju&s;tification of Life. Him, as the Apo&s;tle ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <HI>Hath God &s;et forth to be a Propitiation</HI> (or Atonement) <HI>thro' Faith in his Blood.</HI> As by the Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of the Fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> all his natural Offspring are condemned, &s;o by the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of the Second, all his &s;piritual Offspring, <HI>viz.</HI> Believers, are ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>But &s;eeing the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is two-fold, <HI>viz.</HI> e&s;&s;ential and acquired, of his Nature and Life; it may be queried, which of the&s;e is imputed to Believers? To this it may be replied, that, albeit, the whole Saviour, and his entire Righteou&s;ne&s;s, does conduce to our Ju&s;tifica|tion, ina&s;much as he is wholly given of God to the World, that who&s;oever believes in him might obtain eternal Salvation; his Birth and Life was not for him|&s;elf, but for us; hence it's &s;aid, that he came not to be mini&s;tered unto, but to mini&s;ter, and give his Life a Ran&s;om for many: Neverthele&s;s, the e&s;&s;ential Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, both divine and humane, does not
<PB N="9" REF="004824_0008_100DF8769AF28F40">conduce to our Ju&s;tification, <HI>as our Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> for which we are ju&s;tified; becau&s;e that that was nece&s;&s;ary for him&s;elf: And to &s;uppo&s;e that it is imputed to us, would render the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his Life and Death unnece&s;&s;a|ry. It was neverthele&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to qualify the Per&s;on of the Mediator, to compa&s;s that Righteou&s;ne&s;s for which we are ju&s;tified, which is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his Life and Death. This is u&s;ually called his active and pa&s;&s;ive Obedience: The active Obedience of Chri&s;t is his per|fect fulfilling the Commands of the Law of God: His pa&s;&s;ive, is his Suffering tho&s;e Penalties which were threaten'd for our Breaches of it, if not altogether in Kind, yet in Weight. The Precept and Penalty of the Law mu&s;t both be fulfilled, becau&s;e of God's Holi|ne&s;s and Truth, in order to free us from the Guilt of Sin, and acquire for us a Right to Salvation, which we had forfeited by it. Our Ju&s;tification is to be a&s;crib'd to the whole Obedience of Chri&s;t, both active and pa&s;|&s;ive, con&s;idered complexly or together; becau&s;e that Satisfying and Meriting don't differ really in this Affair. Does not the Scripture inform us, that <HI>as by one Man's Di&s;obedience many were made Sinners, &s;o by the Obedience of one &s;hall many be made Righteous.</HI></P>
<P>That the Satisfaction of Chri&s;t was &s;ufficient to an|&s;wer the Demands of the Law and Ju&s;tice, violated and incen&s;ed by the Creature's Sin, will appear, by con&s;i|dering the Quality of his Per&s;on, the Degrees of his Sufferings, and the Perfection of his Obedience.</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us was not the Son of God meerly by Office, but by Nature: On this Account we are told, that <HI>he reckoned it no Robbery to be equal with God;</HI> and hence he is called the Brightne&s;s of his Father's Glory. Now the Dignity of his Per&s;on mu&s;t needs derive an in|finite Value both upon his Sufferings and Obedience, &s;eeing they were endured and performed by one who was as really God (in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word) as he was truly Man; they mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity contain in
<PB N="10" REF="004824_0009_100DF87823C44BB8">them infinite Worth. Is it not the unniver&s;al Suffrage of all Nations, that Puni&s;hments receive their E&s;timate from the Quality of the Per&s;ons &s;uffering? Had not our Lord been Man he could not have &s;uffered at all; for the Deity is impa&s;&s;ible: And had he not been God as well as Man, his Sufferings could not have contain'd infinite Value in them, and &s;o never have an&s;wered the infinite demerit of Sin.</P>
<P>Now, the Sufferings which our Lord endured in his Body and Soul in his Life, and at his Death, were great in degree; this, his Agony and bloody Sweat in the Gar|den, and Out-cry on the Cro&s;s, <HI>viz. Eli, Eli, lama &s;abacthani,</HI> &s;ufficiently confirm. Hence he is &s;aid to tread the Wine-Pre&s;s of his Father's Wrath alone: Undoubt|edly a Weight of Wrath equal, in Degree, to the Num|ber and Heinou&s;ne&s;s of all the Sins of the Elect-World, was laid upon the Soul and Body of Chri&s;t, which no|thing le&s;s than the Divine Nature could &s;upport him under. O how affecting is the Narrative which the Evangeli&s;ts give us of the Sufferings of Chri&s;t in his Body, by Blows, Scourges, Nails, Thorns, and a cruel Spear! And was not his Soul &s;orrowful even to Death?</P>
<P>Had not our Lord, in the Quality of a Surety, &s;uf|ficiently &s;atisfied the Law in his Death, he could not have obtain'd an Acquittance in his Re&s;urrection; but ina&s;much as he was relea&s;ed from the Grave, as a Pri|&s;on, by publick Sentence, and had a triumphant Entry into Heaven, it evidently proves the Sufficiency of his Satisfaction. And the active Obedience of Chri&s;t, was compleat and &s;potle&s;s. Hence we are told, that he was holy, harmle&s;s and undefiled, and that it became him to fulfil all Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>That the Satisfaction of a Surety in the Sinners room &s;hould be accepted upon his Account, is wholly owing to the ab&s;olute Sovereignty and meer good Plea&s;ure of the great God.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004824_0010_100DF87A5D0181B0">
Right Rea&s;on will inform us, that the Almighty, by an Act of Supremacy, might relax the Law as to the Letter of it (which required perfect, per&s;onal Obedience, upon Pain of Death, to be endured by the Delinquent) and di&s;pen&s;e with its Execution upon &s;uch Con&s;idera|tions, as might an&s;wer the Ends of Government. And this, we are a&s;&s;ured by the &s;acred Oracles, the ble&s;&s;ed God did. Men not being able to obey perfectly, they being them&s;elves imperfect, and being equally un|capable to &s;atisfy for their Offences, them&s;elves being finite; in order to prevent their unavoidable and ever|la&s;ting Ruin, it plea&s;ed the eternal Father to appoint a Mediator to interpo&s;e, by Way of Surety, to authorize and qualify him for this Office, and to declare his Ac|ceptance of his Execution of it. Hence we are told, that <HI>Him hath the Father &s;ealed, and that in him is the Father well plea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>But that which compleats the Whole, is the Redee|mer's con&s;enting to his Father's Propo&s;als, <HI>viz.</HI> to &s;uffer and obey in the Sinners room, and thereby to &s;atisfy divine Ju&s;tice for them. The Efficacy of the Redee|mer's Obedience depends much upon his own volunta|ry Engagement; for being the Lord of Heaven there was no &s;uperiour Authority to compel him; and &s;up|po&s;ing there were, he being perfectly innocent, it would not accord with Ju&s;tice, to force him to &s;uffer for ano|ther's Crimes: But as the Proverb is, <HI>To a willing Mind there is no Injury done.</HI> Our Lord informs us, that <HI>he had Power to lay down his Life,</HI> and that <HI>he was willing to do it.</HI> He him&s;elf al&s;o a&s;&s;ures us, by &s;aying, <HI>Lo I come, in the Volume of thy Book it is written of me: I delight to do thy Will, O my God; yea, thy Law is within my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>But however excellent and perfect the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Mediator is, it can be of no avail to us, without an Appropriation. Here therefore it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enquire how it is made ours? and that is two Ways,
<PB N="12" REF="004824_0011_100DF87BEDACCF60"><HI>viz.</HI> by Imputation, and Faith, as was ob&s;erved in the De&s;cription; the former is without us, and the latter is within us.</P>
<P>He that hath no inward or inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own, for which he &s;hould be ju&s;tified; can be ju&s;tified no other way but by Imputation. However this Term has been &s;coffed at by <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and other Oppo&s;ers of the Doctrines of Grace; yet we find it is a &s;criptural one. It is &s;aid of <HI>Abraham,</HI> that he believ'd God, and it was counted to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and that the Man is ble&s;&s;ed to whom God will not impute Sin.
<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 3, 4, 7, 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now the afore&s;aid Imputation con&s;i&s;ts in the Father's giving of his Son to us;
<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Job.</HI> iii. 16.</NOTE> and in his referring or ac|counting the Virtue of his Death and Obedience &s;o far to us as thereby to free us from everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment, and entitle us to everla&s;ting Re&s;t.</P>
<P>But the inward Mean on Men's Part, of Appropria|ting the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to us, is Faith; not a dead Faith! which is de&s;titute of good Works: No, &s;uch a hi&s;torical, ineffectual A&s;&s;ent to Truth, if it be depended upon, will but &s;erve to deceive us into Ruin, and aggravate our everla&s;ting Pains thro' Surprize. The Faith which ju&s;tifies, is a living Principle of good Action, form'd by God's almighty Power in the Soul, by which we are re&s;olved to have God for our la&s;t End, and Chri&s;t for our only Mediator.
<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jam.</HI> ii. 18. <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 19. <HI>Job.</HI> i. 11, 12.</NOTE> This operative Faith is only a Mean of our Ju&s;tification, or prerequi&s;ite to it; not any de&s;erving Cau&s;e of it, either in Whole or in Part: Therefore our Text a&s;&s;erts, that we are ju&s;tified by Faith, not for Faith: Faith, in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Ju&s;tification, is only an In&s;trument whereby we ap|prehend and lay hold of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t for our Ju&s;tification. If Faith, con&s;idered as a Work of the
<PB N="13" REF="004824_0012_100DF87EE06DC200">Creature, was in any degree a meritorious Cau&s;e of our Ju&s;tification, then we &s;hould be ju&s;tified by Works, con|trary to the Scriptures. That Faith &s;hould have any In&s;trumentality in our Ju&s;tification above other Graces, is entirely owing to the mo&s;t free Con&s;titution of Al|mighty God: But in the mean Time, we may ven|ture to &s;ay, that in this Method the Purene&s;s of divine Grace &s;hines with the greate&s;t Glory towards poor Sin|ners, in that God will ju&s;tify them upon the Account of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his Son, received by Faith alone: And the Wildom of God is al&s;o di&s;cover'd in Choo&s;ing this Grace to be the In&s;trument of a Sinner's Ju&s;tifica|tion, or a Prerequi&s;ite before it; becau&s;e as it inclines to exalting Thoughts of God, &s;o it empties a Man of Self, and breaks the Pride of the Heart.</P>
<P>It was before ob&s;erved, in the De&s;cription of Ju&s;tifi|cation, that God thereby frees Per&s;ons from the Guilt of Sin, and gives them a Right to eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>By the Guilt of Sin, an Obligation or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to Puni&s;hment, by rea&s;on of the Threatnings of the Law again&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, is intended. There is no Con|demnation to tho&s;e that are ju&s;tified.
<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 1, 33, 34.</NOTE> It is true, by Ju&s;tification the almighty God does not take away the Stain of Sin; for that is done afterwards by Sanctifica|tion. Neither are all Effects of Sin together and at once removed. Even ju&s;tified Per&s;ons are excercis'd with various Afflictions, and at la&s;t endure the Pains of a temporal Death. But the&s;e are not proper Puni&s;h|ments inflicted with any view to compen&s;ate the Injury offered by Sin to God. Neither do they proceed from his vindicative Ju&s;tice, or tend to the Hurt of the Per&s;on afflicted: No, they are Cha&s;tnings indeed! oc|ca&s;ioned by Sin, but proceeding from the fatherly Love of God; they are made to promote the Good of the Ju&s;tify'd.
<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 28.</NOTE> Now, &s;eeing the Guilt of Sin is two|fold
<PB N="14" REF="004824_0013_100DF88067F26508">namely, potential and actual, it is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed that Ju&s;tification removes both: No, potential Guilt is in&s;eparable from Sin; for it is contradictory to &s;uppo&s;e any thing to be Sin and not at the &s;ame time to de&s;erve Puni&s;hment: It is therefore the latter only which Ju&s;tification aboli&s;hes, namely, the Sinner's O|bligation to Puni&s;hment; and that by transferring it upon the Surety, who in this re&s;pect was made Sin for us, and therefore bore our Iniquities (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Puni&s;h|ments due for them) on his Body on the Tree.</P>
<P>Moreover, as the Guilt of Sin involves or includes a certain Captivity to Corruption, a Debt or Subjection to Puni&s;hment, and an Enmity again&s;t God;
<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 7.</NOTE> &s;o that Ab&s;olution, which Ju&s;tification includes, has a threefold Denomination: In re&s;pect of Bondage it is cal|led Redemption, which is the Freeing of a Captive Soldier, by the Payment of a certain Price: In re&s;pect of Debt and Puni&s;hment, it is called Remi&s;&s;ion or For|givene&s;s:
<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;a.</HI> xxxii. 1.</NOTE> In re&s;pect of Enmity and Hatred there|by removed, it is called Reconciliation
<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 20.</NOTE> ina&s;much as it &s;ignifies the Application of Reconciliation to the Soul. When Guilt, which is the only Cau&s;e of En|mity, is removed, then a &s;weet Peace, Friend&s;hip and Communion with God is hereby introduced into the Soul. Truely, &s;uch have Fellow&s;hip with the Father, and with his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The Guilt of Sin being removed, a Right to eternal Life mu&s;t needs &s;ucceed; which it is be&s;t to a&s;cribe to the whole undivided Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> of his active and pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, as the meritorious Cau&s;e thereof. Ina&s;much as there &s;eems to be no real Difference between a Freedom from eternal Death, and a Right to eternal Life, no more than between Satisfac|tion and Merit; it therefore &s;eems not proper (in our
<PB N="15" REF="004824_0014_100DF882888D21F8">Sentiments) to deprive the pa&s;&s;ive Obedience of Chri&s;t of the Honour of De&s;erving, or the Active of the Ho|nour of Satisfying.</P>
<P>Albeit, that Ju&s;tification is an unalterable Sentence of almighty God, that can never be repealed, the Sins of the Ju&s;tify'd will not be remembered to their Con|demnation; for it is God that ju&s;tifieth, who is he therefore that condemneth? Yet it is nece&s;&s;ary to have the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t repeatedly apply'd to the Soul by frequent Acts of Faith; becau&s;e of Sins com|mitted after the Beginning of our Ju&s;tification, that &s;o it may be continued until it is con&s;ummate at the la&s;t Judgment by that Voice of Chri&s;t, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' the Per&s;everance of the Ju&s;tify'd is bottom'd upon the Promi&s;e of a faithful God;
<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> xxxii. 40.</NOTE> yet it is &s;uch as renders the U&s;e of a Means nece&s;&s;ary. We mu&s;t la|bour to keep our&s;elves in the Love of God: And altho' Works are no meritorious Cau&s;e of our Ju&s;tification, yet are they nece&s;&s;ary Means to obtain it from God, who will be enquired of the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to do tho&s;e Things for them which he has even purpo&s;ed to confer.</P>
<P>But it is time to proceed to the</P>
<P>SECOND GENERAL HEAD of Di&s;cour&s;e, which was to &s;hew that Ju&s;tification cannot be attain'd by the Works of the Law. To this end, let it be con|&s;idered, that in order to Ju&s;tification by the Law a Perfection of Obedience is nece&s;&s;ary; the Law cur&s;es for the lea&s;t Default in Thought, Word or Action. <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 10.</P>
<P>Now, this is, at pre&s;ent, impo&s;&s;ible for us to perform; for we have already, in our fir&s;t Parents, &s;inned and come &s;hort of the Glory of God; and on this Account every Mouth is &s;top'd, and the whole World is become guilty before God: That awful Tre&s;pa&s;s has robb'd us
<PB N="16" REF="004824_0015_100DF884A5AE0AB8">of our original Integrity, Harmony and Beauty, and in|troduc'd into all our Powers a univer&s;al Depravity, Di&s;cord and Deformity. How therefore can &s;uch im|perfect Cau&s;es produce perfect Effects? This is impo&s;|&s;ible in the Nature of Things. But &s;uppo&s;ing we could keep the Law of God in time to come; yet how could we make Satisfaction for our pa&s;t Di&s;obedience? &s;eeing that Sin is an Offence committed again&s;t a Being of infinite Perfections, a Being to whom we are under infinite Obligations, not only by rea&s;on of his e&s;&s;ential Excellency, but communicative Kindne&s;s to us; of all which, Sin is a rebellious and ungrateful Breach; it mu&s;t therefore, in its Nature, de&s;erve infinite Puni&s;hment. which God, in Ju&s;tice, is obliged to inflict. But this, contracted into a finite Space, no meer Creature can &s;u&s;tain; it would &s;urely de&s;troy his Being: Therefore what the Puni&s;hment wants in Weight nu&s;t be made up in Continuance; and thus the &s;inning Creature will be forever &s;uffering, and can never &s;atisfy.</P>
<P>Before Per&s;ons have Faith, the divine Word informs us, that whatever they do is Sin; and as &s;oon as they attain Faith, they are united to Chri&s;t, and &s;o mu&s;t needs be ju&s;tified by his Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Now, is it not un|rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that what is Sin, at lea&s;t in the Manner of Performance, &s;hould be a meritorious Cau&s;e of Ju&s;tification?</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e that we are ju&s;tified by Works, is to &s;ay that the Reward is not of Grace but of Debt; contrary to the mo&s;t plain and repeated Declarations of Scrip|ture, that our Ju&s;tification is free and gracious.
<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 20, 24. <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 7, 8.</NOTE> Neither can our Ju&s;tification be partly of Grace, and partly of Works; for thus, as the Apo&s;tle ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <HI>Grace would be no more Grace, and Works would be no more Works.</HI> To be ju&s;tified by Grace is to be ju&s;tified freely, without a Re&s;pect to any Work of the Creature as a de&s;erving Cau&s;e thereof: But to be ju&s;tified by
<PB N="17" REF="004824_0016_100DF886C76B3350">Works, in any degree re&s;pects them as a de&s;erving Cau&s;e. Now, here is an unreconcilable Contra|diction. It is the &s;ame Thing &s;ub&s;tantially in the Ca&s;e before us, whether Merit is &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t in the Worth of the Work done, or in a Promi&s;e of the Al|mighty, pretended to be annexed to the Endeavours of natural Men: Which the Papi&s;ts di&s;tingui&s;h by the Terms of Congruity and Condignity; for both Ways God is bound, by the Labours of his Enemies to give them Happine&s;s. Whatever Probability of obtaining does attend the Endeavours of natural Men, there is no certainty, otherwi&s;e Ju&s;tification would be by the Works of the Law; and indeed, we may as ea&s;ily reconcile Light and Darkne&s;s, Fire and Water, Life and Death, as Ju&s;tification partly by Works, and partly by Grace; for Grace mu&s;t lo&s;e its Nature, if it be by Works with it, and Works mu&s;t lo&s;e their Nature, if it be by Grace together with them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, to &s;uppo&s;e that the Works of the Creature are join'd with the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, as de&s;erving Cau&s;es of Ju&s;tification, reflects great Di&s;honour upon his Satisfaction; for it plainly intimates that it is incom|pleat: If it is compleat, as the Te&s;timony of the Father declares, by &s;aying, <HI>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well plea&s;ed;</HI> then there is no Need of the Creature's Additions: If it be incompleat, then how can an im|perfect Creature accompli&s;h that which God him&s;elf is &s;uppo&s;ed to have left unfini&s;hed. Undoubtedly, there is &s;till a Nece&s;&s;ity of Obedience to the moral Law, as it is an invariable Rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s corre&s;ponding to the divine Perfections, in order to te&s;tify our Regard to God's commanding Authority, and our Gratitude for his Love to us, as well as to te&s;tify the Truth of our Faith in him: But by no means is our Obedience to be admitted as a meritorious Cau&s;e of our Acceptance with God; for in that re&s;pect Chri&s;t has become the End of the Law to every one that believeth; as <HI>Bernard,</HI> of
<PB N="18" REF="004824_0017_100DF8884FB13A28">old, ob&s;erved, <HI>Tho' Works be the Way to the Kingdom, yet they are not the Cau&s;e of our Reigning there.</HI> Surely we &s;hould expect Ju&s;tification only in that Way in which <HI>Abraham,</HI> the Father of the Faithful, obtain'd it; but that was not by Works, but by Faith. If <HI>Abraham,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, were ju&s;tified by Works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.</HI></P>
<P>The Scripture a&s;&s;erts, that we are ju&s;tified in that Way, which excludes all Boa&s;ting; but by what Law is it excluded; is it by the Law of Works? nay, but by the Law of Faith. If Man contributed any thing towards his Ju&s;tification, he would have whereof to glory, but this no Man hath; hence we are told that God ju&s;tifieth the Ungodly, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;uch as have no Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of their own to commend them to his Favour; and that he imputeth Righteou&s;ne&s;s without Works.</P>
<P>If they which are of the Law be Heirs, <HI>i. e.</HI> if Men by Obedience to the Law can procure an Intere&s;t in the heavenly Inheritance, then is Faith made void, and the Promi&s;e made of none Effect: There is no need of Believing in Je&s;us for that which we have in our&s;elves; nor any need of his Attonement, &s;eeing that the Matter can be otherwi&s;e adju&s;ted, according to this Notion; and if &s;o the very Foundation of the Go&s;pel is overthrown; for what need is there of a Saviour to do that for us which we can do for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> on the Contrary informs us, That I&s;rael, <HI>who &s;ought after Righteou&s;ne&s;s, did not obtain it; becau&s;e they &s;ought it, as it were, by the Works of the Law; and that being ignorant of God, and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, they did not &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God:</HI> But of him&s;elf he &s;ays, That <HI>he de&s;ired not to be found in that Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law; but that which is thro' the Faith of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Well, &s;eeing Ju&s;tification by Works is of impo&s;&s;ible Attainment, and there being no other Way of Ju&s;tifi|cation open'd but by Faith, it mu&s;t therefore of Nece&s;|&s;ity
<PB N="19" REF="004824_0018_100DF88A6EBCE3B8">be by Faith; and this, indeed is frequently and and roundly a&s;&s;erted in the Epi&s;tles of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Galatians.</HI></P>
<P>The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is &s;uch alone as can di&s;|charge the Sinner's Debts, and procure for him an heavenly Inheritance; and in this Way of Acceptance God is mo&s;t glorified, and Man mo&s;t humbled.</P>
<P>Neither does this Scheme of Free-Ju&s;tification, open a Door to Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as &s;ome have imagined; but on the Contrary, it &s;ecures Obedience upon the be&s;t Foundation, ina&s;much as that Faith, which ju&s;tifies, is a living, la&s;ting Principle of holy and humble Ac|tion; and the more free and rich the Love of God is to us the more it mu&s;t needs excite our Love to him: For Love is Love's-Load &s;tone; and mu&s;t not every one confe&s;s that Love is the only Principle of evangelical and acceptable Obedience; and that in Proportion to the Strength of the Cau&s;e, will be the Effects produced by it. That Obedience, which principally &s;prings from a meaner Source, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;lavi&s;h dread of the divine Re|venge, or hireling Notions of thereby purcha&s;ing Hap|pine&s;s, however fair Appearances it may have in the Eye of Man, is fle&s;hly and dead; and therefore abhor'd by that God who is a Spirit. The Apo&s;tle therefore, ju&s;tly rejected the afore&s;aid Cavil with Dete&s;tation, <HI>Shall we continue in Sin that Grace may abound? God forbid,</HI> &s;ay'd he: <HI>How &s;hall we that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?</HI> And el&s;ewhere, <HI>do we make void the Law by Faith? Yea</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>we e&s;tabli&s;h the Law:</HI> Namely, by providing a Righteou&s;ne&s;s which fully an|&s;wers its Demands, and by exciting Obedience to its Precepts from the noble&s;t Principle, <HI>viz.</HI> Love.</P>
<P>If it be oppo&s;ed, to what has been before ob&s;erved, that we can no more be righteous, becau&s;e of another's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, than we can be wi&s;e or learn'd, becau&s;e of another's Wi&s;dom or Learning; it may be reply'd, that the Objection will hold &s;o far as it concerns an
<PB N="20" REF="004824_0019_100DF88CECC5EA00">e&s;&s;ential or inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which cannot, by Imputation, be &s;o made another's, that thro' That he he &s;hould be reckon'd inherently Righteous; neither do we affirm any &s;uch Thing relating to Ju&s;tification. Be&s;ides, there is al&s;o a Difference in this, that one can|not be united with another, &s;o as Believers are with Chri&s;t, as Members with the Head. By the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t being imputed to us, we under&s;tand no more, than that his Merit and Satisfaction is &s;o far reckoned to us as that we are thereby freed from the Guilt of Sin, and obtain a Right to Salvation.</P>
<P>But it is time to proceed to the IMPROVEMENT of this noble and important Subject: And here let us con|&s;ider a little of that Honour that is hereby reflected upon the divine Atributes. With what &s;urprizing and un|rival'd Glory does the un&s;earchable Wi&s;dom of <HI>Jeho|vah</HI> &s;hine, in Devi&s;ing and Concerting a Method, which at the &s;ame time e&s;tabli&s;hes his inviolable Truth, engaged to i&s;&s;ue the Threats of the broken Covenant, &s;atisfies his awful and inflexible Ju&s;tice, wrong'd by the Creature's Sin, thro' an almighty Surety's Sufferings in their Room and Stead; &s;ecures the End of Govern|ment, by Honouring the Law more than it ever was before, thro' the &s;potle&s;s Obedience of one who was God, as well as Man, in the Guilty Sinner's Place: And yet opens a Door for the Manife&s;tation of the pure&s;t and riche&s;t Grace upon unworthy and condemned Ra|bels, in their Acceptance and Salvation! while fallen Angels, a nobler Order of Creatures, are wholly pa&s;&s;ed by, and no Offer of Mercy made to them! What Man, what Angel, can &s;ufficiently declare the Depth, the Glory of divine Wi&s;dom, which has taken occa&s;ion by the Creature's Sin, which is the vile&s;t Evil, to bring the greate&s;t Glory to him&s;elf, and the greate&s;t Good to Mankind? O! with what Maje&s;ty and Sweetne&s;s, does the Harmony of divine Perfections &s;parkle forth in the Re|demption
<PB N="21" REF="004824_0020_100DF88F9ED7D7F0">of Man by Je&s;us Chri&s;t? And, O! how a|mazingly is their Salvation hereby &s;ecured upon a more un&s;haken Foundation than while Man remained in a State of Innocency; for now is their Stock in the Me|diator's Hands. O! let us dwell upon the Thoughts of the&s;e Things 'til our Hearts be fir'd with Love and Gratitude.</P>
<P>But how can we expre&s;s Gratitude without Searching the Foundations of our Hope; &s;eeing that all our Peace and Con&s;olation in Adver&s;ity, depends upon the Cer|tainty of our Ju&s;tification? It mu&s;t needs be a Duty of the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity for us to enquire into our pre&s;ent State: Which that we may do to &s;ome Purpo&s;e, Faith, which is the In&s;trument of our Ju&s;tification, &s;hould be impartially examined. Now, tho&s;e that have true Faith, have been, according to the Promi&s;e of our Saviour, convinced of their Unbelief, <HI>i. e.</HI> of their total Want of Faith, their Inability to believe, their utter Unworthine&s;s of the Gift of Faith; as well as of the Rebellion and Ingratitude, that is gra&s;p'd in Unbelief, and of the hor|rible Mi&s;eries con&s;equent thereupon. And &s;eeing Faith is a Receiving of Chri&s;t, in all his Offices, upon Go&s;|pel Terms, <HI>Joh.</HI> i. 12. Therefore, tho&s;e that do be|lieve, have been made &s;en&s;ible of their Need of Chri&s;t in all his Offices: They have groan'd under the Burden of their Ignorance, Guilt and Slavery, and have ex|perienced a Vertue flowing from the &s;everal Offices of Chri&s;t to the Healing of the afore&s;aid Di&s;ea&s;es. And indeed, every Believer feels a daily Need of Chri&s;t, in all his Offices; he daily lives upon Chri&s;t, and to him, and no more to him&s;elf; he comes out of the Wilder|ne&s;s of this World leaning upon his <HI>Beloved;</HI> for to him to live is Chri&s;t. Chri&s;t is the principal Support and highe&s;t End of the Believer's Life; as the Glory of Chri&s;t is the highe&s;t Mark of all the different Kinds of his Action (in general) &s;o the Love of Chri&s;t, as a Principle, con&s;trains him to act; and under a Sen&s;e of
<PB N="22" REF="004824_0021_100DF89127D2AFD8">his own Folly and Weakne&s;s, by the Exerci&s;e of Faith, he de&s;ires Strength from Chri&s;t, as the Head of Influence, to &s;erve God &s;piritually, not in the Oldne&s;s of the Letter, but in the Newne&s;s of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Again, as the vital Act of Faith con&s;i&s;ts in the Con|&s;ent of the Will to Go&s;pel Terms; therefore, tho&s;e that believe to Ju&s;tification, mu&s;t needs know, and have &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered them, as well as without Re|&s;erve, and with Re&s;olution comply'd with them. Hence, we may &s;afely a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch who know not, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, by Experience, what it is to deny their natural, civil, &s;inful and religious Self, are Unbe|lievers: For, not only Sin, is to be deny'd or for&s;aken ab&s;olutely and immediately; but even the other Kinds of Self, in &s;ome Re&s;pects: And tho&s;e al&s;o who take not up the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and follow him, do not believe in him with a ju&s;tifying Faith.</P>
<P>It may be here ob&s;erv'd, that as the Per&s;on (mention|ed in the Go&s;pel) in his Coming to Chri&s;t, was thrown down and torn by the Devil; &s;o it is common for tho&s;e, that believe to Ju&s;tification, to be oppo&s;ed and tempted by the Devil in Believing. Ju&s;tifying Faith does al&s;o produce powerful Effects; as it makes Chri&s;t precious to the Soul, &s;o it humbles the Sinner's Heart, and makes him think, with <HI>Paul,</HI> that <HI>He is le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints:</HI> It gives Victory over the World (<HI>viz.</HI> the Lu&s;ts of it) and works by Love to God and Man. What is &s;aid of Hope may be ju&s;tly apply'd to Faith, <HI>viz.</HI> that it purifies the Heart, <HI>i. e.</HI> makes Per&s;ons de|&s;irous after, and labouring for Heart-Purity, and cau|&s;es them to enter into a Cour&s;e of War again&s;t the Contrary.</P>
<P>Such as have a ju&s;tifying Faith, mu&s;t needs have been brought to a Heart-affecting Complai&s;ance with the Go&s;pel Scheme of Salvation by Grace: This Way they de&s;ire to be &s;aved, and no other. <HI>Phil.</HI> iii. 7, 8, 9.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004824_0022_100DF892B0581558">
And &s;eeing that Faith is the Bond of Union to Chri&s;t, it mu&s;t needs affect Believers with a high Regard to his Honour and Kingdom. Every Believer therefore has a a &s;ingle Eye to the Glory of God in the Cour&s;e of his Actions. O how much depends upon this! If our Eye be &s;ingle, our whole Body is full of Light; if not, it is full of Darkne&s;s. O! if you think that this is of ea&s;y Attainment, and that you have always had it, you are &s;urely ignorant of God and your&s;elves! For no natural Man on Earth hath, or while he &s;o remains, can have a &s;ingle Eye: A Fountain can't &s;end forth Streams above a Level with it&s;elf.</P>
<P>If you have a ju&s;tifying Faith, <HI>my dear Brethren,</HI> ye &s;urely have a tender Regard to the Church of God; as a Member of the natural Body, that is united by a li|ving Band to the Whole, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with the Pains and Plea&s;ures of any Part thereof. Thus it is with you, if ye believe. When God's Name is prophan'd, and his Kingdom is not promoted, ye mourn; but when God is glorified, and Sinners are convinced and converted, ye rejoice.</P>
<P>Again, &s;uch as are ju&s;tified, are effectually called, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 30. The Voice of Chri&s;t is accompanied with &s;upernatural Light and irre&s;i&s;tible Power upon their Minds and Hearts, which bani&s;h their natural Dark|ne&s;s, Rebellion and Prejudice, and make them &s;toop to the Saviour's Scepter. He that commanded the Light to &s;hine at fir&s;t out of Darkne&s;s, gives them the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Chri&s;t. God &s;ends the Rod of his Strength out of <HI>Zion,</HI> and makes his People a willing People in the Day of his Power.</P>
<P>And tho&s;e that are ju&s;tified do confe&s;s their Sins with deep Humiliation, Shame and Sorrow; as the <HI>Publican,</HI> who &s;tood afar off, and &s;mote upon his Brea&s;t, and &s;aid, <HI>God be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI> This Man went to his Hou&s;e ju&s;tify'd, when the proud <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> was rejected.</P>

But the ju&s;tified Per&s;on does not only confe&s;s Sin, but for&s;ake it in his Heart, and Practice: For there is an in|&s;eparable Conection between Ju&s;tification and Sanctifi|cation, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 11. As Ju&s;tification includes in it Reconciliation to God; this, in the Order of Nature, as well as of God, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es our being &s;or|rowfully &s;en&s;ible of our natural Enmity again&s;t him; and therefore &s;uch as have not been made &s;en&s;ible of the latter, may a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves that they are unacquainted with the former, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 7. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 20.</P>
<P>And tho&s;e that are reconcil'd to God him&s;elf, mu&s;t needs be reconcil'd to his People, his Laws and Pro|vidences.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Things, <HI>my dear Friends,</HI> we &s;hould exa|mine our&s;elves, and &s;ee whether we be ju&s;tified or not.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who have experienced the afore&s;aid Signs of Ju&s;tification, ye are ble&s;&s;ed indeed! <HI>P&s;a.</HI> xxxi. 1. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man who&s;e Iniquity is forgiven, and who&s;e Sin is covered:</HI> For ye have Peace with God, and Peace with Con&s;cience; that Peace which pa&s;&s;es all under|&s;tanding; that Peace which Chri&s;t left as a Legacy to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 1. And &s;uch have free Acce&s;s, with a humble Boldne&s;s, to a gracious God in all their Straits, who is both willing and able to relieve them, <HI>Eph.</HI> iii. 12. And, O how noble! how &s;weet! how precious! and how important, is thy Privilege! Who can expre&s;s it? Such &s;hall per&s;evere in the Grace of God, and be carry'd by his mighty Power thro' Faith unto Salvation. The Gates of Hell &s;hall never prevail again&s;t them, nor Death or Life &s;eparate them from the Love of God, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Such may re|joice in the Hope of the Glory of God, and triumph in all Adver&s;ity; &s;eeing every Affliction they meet with &s;prings from a Father's Love, and &s;hall &s;urely, by his Direction, promote their Good; e&s;pecially con&s;idering that under Affliction the Love of God is more frequent|ly &s;hed abroad in their Hearts. Such are by the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="004824_0024_100DEE8FE65AC190">of Chri&s;t freed from the Guilt of Sin, the Wrath of God, and eternal Condemnation. O what &s;weet Con&s;olation &s;prings from the Doctrine of Ju&s;tifi|cation to every pious Soul in every Di&s;tre&s;s! whether it be Trouble of Con&s;cience about the Multitude and Heinou&s;ne&s;s of their Sins, or Fears of Death, Judg|ment and Hell, or worldly Calamities and unju&s;t Cen|&s;ures. What can more effectually &s;upport the Soul than to think that it is God who ju&s;tifieth, again&s;t whom neither the Accu&s;ations of Satan and of the World; nay, nor of our own Con&s;ciences, can in the lea&s;t a|vail. As al&s;o, that God does not ju&s;tify the Righteous, but Sinners; and that of the deepe&s;t Dye, <HI>namely,</HI> the Ungodly and Rebellious, from pure Grace; whereby he imputes the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his only begotten Son to them; and thereby, upon their Believing in him, frees them from the Guilt of all their Offences, how many and great &s;oever they be, and entitules them to eternal Glory. Hence he is &s;aid, not to behold Iniqui|ty in <HI>Jacob,</HI> or Perver&s;ne&s;s in <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>But on the Contrary, how mi&s;erable is the Ca&s;e of all unju&s;tify'd Per&s;ons! <HI>namely,</HI> &s;uch who want the Signs of Faith and Ju&s;tification, before de&s;cribed: Such who profe&s;s Chri&s;t in Words, but in Works deny him: Such who have only a dead Faith without Works: Such who are Strangers to the Power of experimental Re|ligion, Communion with God, and Conformity to him.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the Unju&s;tify'd in Life, their Per&s;ons are cover'd with the ba&s;e&s;t Deformity; their Bodies are In&s;truments of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s to Sin; and their Minds and Con&s;ciences are defil'd.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect of their worldly Goods, they are U&s;urpers; Man having by his Fall lo&s;t his original Right to the Creatures, it can be only recover'd by an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, thro' Faith; who is made, by his Father, Heir of all Things. Now, ina&s;much as they want this, they
<PB N="26" REF="004824_0025_100DF8996B7EE728">are U&s;urpers in the Sight of God, whatever civil Claim they may have notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>In regard to their Plea&s;ures and Pro&s;perity, it is ju&s;t|ly &s;aid, that their Table is a Snare and a Trap to their Souls, and that the Pro&s;perity of Fools de&s;troys them; they &s;tand on &s;lippery Places, and are but the more pre|par'd for an aggravated Ruin by all their pro&s;perous Suc|ce&s;&s;es; even their very Ble&s;&s;ings are accur&s;ed, as the Prophet <HI>Malachi</HI> expre&s;&s;es it.</P>
<P>Their honourable Exaltations &s;erve but to &s;ink them lower at la&s;t in the Dungeon of Devils.</P>
<P>Their Afflictions are dreadful Pre&s;ages of their ap|proaching, unavoidable and eternal Mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>And, O! how dreadful is the Ca&s;e of the Unju&s;tify'd at Death (e&s;pecially if awakened to a Sen&s;e of Danger) when they mu&s;t turn their Backs forever upon all cre|ated Enjoyments, face Death with all its grizly Hor|rors, feel its invenom'd Sting, and launch the eternal Deep; and in the mean time have no Grain of Com|fort, or Glimp&s;e of Hope; to u&s;e the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI>'s Words, <HI>How are they brought into De&s;truction, as in a Moment, they are utterly con&s;umed with Terrors!</HI></P>
<P>But if in our Mediation we follow the Unju&s;tify'd farther, we may behold their increa&s;ing Mi&s;eries: With what Confu&s;ion &s;hall they &s;tand before the Bar of the great God at the general Judgment! while every of their Sins are expo&s;ed in all their awful Aggravations, and they have none to plead their Cau&s;e. What Hor|ror, Indignation and Pain mu&s;t tear their guilty Souls, when they hear the great Judge pronounce their final Sentence, <HI>Go, ye accur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting Burnings, pre|pared for the Devil and his Angels:</HI> And, behold him laughing at their Calamities.</P>
<P>But if we view their eternal State, alas! how dread|ful and how &s;hocking is the Sight! For in that Pri&s;on where they are irrecoverably fixed; there their Worm does not die, and the Fire is unquenchable, and they
<PB N="27" REF="004824_0026_100DF89B1B807760">&s;hall be an Abhorring to all Fle&s;h, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> lxvi. 24. How &s;hall Horror for pa&s;t Sins, and lo&s;t Mercies, with Fears of future Mi&s;eries, and utter De&s;pair of Relief from them, together with the Vials of divine Vengeance, everla&s;t|ingly rack damned Souls!</P>
<P>Now, &s;eeing the Mi&s;eries of the Unju&s;tify'd are &s;o great, then let Sinners be entreated to beware of abu|&s;ing the precious Doctrine of Ju&s;tification to their own Ruin, by vainly imagining them&s;elves to be Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it, when they are far from it. Tho&s;e who ju&s;tify them&s;elves when God condemns them, are an Abomi|nation to him; they deceive them&s;elves, and ob&s;truct the Way to their Ju&s;tification and Salvation, <HI>Prov.</HI> xvii. 15. <HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 3. <HI>Mat.</HI> xiii. This tho&s;e do, who depend upon Church-Privileges, a dead Faith, the un|covenanted Mercy of God, the Death of Chri&s;t unap|ply'd to the Soul, or their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is infinitely better for you, <HI>my Friends,</HI> to know and own the wor&s;t of your Ca&s;e, and to &s;eek after Ju&s;tifica|tion thro' Chri&s;t with the utmo&s;t Vehemence, by deny|ing your own Righteou&s;ne&s;s (for he that is proud of his own, will not prize, &s;eek or obtain another) by deep Humiliation for your many and heinous Offences, in the Language of the penitent <HI>Publican,</HI> by &s;eeking the Knowledge of Chri&s;t crucify'd, and Help from God to receive him by a living Faith.</P>
<P>And the Saints of God &s;hould be careful that they abu&s;e not the afore&s;aid Doctrine to Sloth and &s;inful Indulgence in their cold Frames; for as this is very Grieving to the Spirit of God, and blots our Evi|dences for Heaven; &s;o it manife&s;ts the vile&s;t Ingratitude, and mini&s;ters an Occa&s;ion of Reflection to the Adver|&s;aries of the Doctrines of Grace.</P>
<P>The People of God &s;hould al&s;o beware of condem|ning them&s;elves when God ju&s;tifies them; &s;eeing that the Father hath lay'd upon Chri&s;t the Iniquities of us all, why &s;hould we as ungratefully as fooli&s;hly lay them
<PB N="28" REF="004824_0027_100DF89D6CD762A8">upon our&s;elves? and &s;o act the Adver&s;ary's Part again&s;t our own Intere&s;t. We ought not to ca&s;t away our Hope becau&s;e we have not had &s;uch deep Convictions, &s;uch great Temptations, and Con&s;olations as &s;ome others; or becau&s;e we have not arrived to the like Degrees of Goodne&s;s; rather let us deal with Chri&s;t as <HI>Aaron,</HI> of old, did with the live Goat, who lay'd both his Hands upon him and confe&s;s'd the Iniquities of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> over him, <HI>Lev.</HI> xvi. 21. After which he is &s;aid to bear their Iniquities into a Land not inhabited. Let us ca&s;t the whole Weight of our Souls and our Sins upon Chri&s;t, by Believing, and then we need not fear Condemnation.</P>
<P>But in the mean Time the Freene&s;s of Ju&s;tification, the Honours and Happine&s;s of that Condition into which the rebellious, mean and mi&s;erable Sinner is thereby introduced, &s;hould excite the utmo&s;t Gratitude to the Author of &s;o great and durable a Benefit; the Sen&s;e of the Worth of this Mercy &s;hould be ever in our Minds, and the Perfections of its Author perpetually celebrated with our Lips; while in the mean time in our Lives we glorify God by all holy Obedience. See|ing God has ju&s;tify'd us freely, without good Works, we &s;hould expre&s;s our Thankfulne&s;s to him, by a more chearful, &s;incere and &s;teady Practice of them; to which let the Love of God con&s;train us.</P>
<P>And particularly, let ju&s;tify'd Per&s;ons obey their Lords command, in &s;itting down at his Table, and Commemorating his dying Love. Here! ye Friends of God! you may &s;ee, as in a Gla&s;s, what the Purcha&s;e of your Pardon co&s;t your deare&s;t Lord. At this Ban+quet you may behold the dreadful Agonies of his Soul, and Sufferings of his Body for your Sins; which &s;hould &s;tir up in us, <HI>my dear Brethren,</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t Affection. O methinks! the holy Je&s;us looks exceedingly lovely as he comes with died Garments from <HI>Bozzra</HI> and <HI>Edom.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="004824_0028_100DF8A0251729B8">
O Sirs! it is the Exerci&s;e of a ju&s;tifying Faith, which as an Eye, can only help us to behold our Lord's Sufferings in a right Manner; and, as a Conduit, can convey to us the Benefits of them. Which may it plea&s;e the good God to give us all for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
