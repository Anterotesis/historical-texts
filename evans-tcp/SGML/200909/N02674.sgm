<P>THE metaphorical Terms in which our Text is delivered, are plain and intelli|gible.

So that by the two <HI>Ways</HI> here &s;poken of, we are to under&s;tand two different &s;orts of Life and Conver&s;ation: a holy one, which leads to the Life and Happine&s;s of Heaven; and a wicked one, which leads to De&s;truction and Mi&s;ery in Hell. And it &s;eems as if, with|out any &s;train upon the Metaphor, we might fall in with that Expo&s;ition <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Blackall</HI> on this text.</NOTE>, which
<PB N="3" REF="003167_0005_0FF087D5953248E8">leads us by the two <HI>Gates</HI> to under&s;tand &s;omething different from what is intended by the two <HI>Ways:</HI> by the <HI>Gate</HI> our SA|VIOUR might mean the fir&s;t Beginning or Entrance upon any cour&s;e of life, whether good or bad; and by the <HI>Way</HI> He might mean a Continuance and Progre&s;s in the &s;ame Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Scope of our SAVIOUR then in our Text is plainly this. He exhorts us to a <HI>godly Life,</HI> and per&s;wades us to enter into and continue in it: ina&s;much as not|with&s;tanding all the Difficulties which at|tend our Entrance into it and Continu|ance in it, and the Smallne&s;s of the num|ber of them who practi&s;e it, 'tis the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>that leadeth unto Life</HI> and Happine&s;s whereas notwith&s;tanding all the carnal Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure which attend the En|trance into a wicked life and Continu|ance in it, and the Multitudes that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, 'tis <HI>the way that leadeth to De&s;truction</HI> and Mi&s;ery.</P>

<P N="1">I. OBSER. <HI>THERE are two different States of exi&s;tence for Mankind after Death, called here</HI> De&s;truction <HI>and</HI> Life, <HI>in one or the other of which we mu&s;t all take up our everla&s;ting abode.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS but for a little &s;ea&s;on that GOD hath appointed any of us to live here up|on Earth; <HI>one generation goes and another comes:</HI> But we know by Divine Reve|lation, that there is a Spirit in Man which will not cea&s;e to be, after this life is end|ed; that our dead Bodies will ri&s;e again and be reunited with our Spirits; and that the State of Di&s;cipline &amp; Probation in this world will be &s;ucceeded by a State of Recompence and Retribution, wherein &s;hall be rendred unto every one, according as we have done or neglected to do the Work a&s;&s;igned us by GOD in this life.</P>
<P>THIS State of Recompence and Retri|bution, according to the infallible Ora|cles of GOD is twofold; and compre|hends in it the &s;tate of Happine&s;s, and the &s;tate of Mi&s;ery; the latter of which
<PB N="6" REF="003167_0008_0FF087DE1956A608">is &s;et forth by the name of <HI>De&s;truction,</HI> and the former by the name of <HI>Life</HI> in our Text. GOD hath appointed a Day in the which He will judge the World in righteou&s;ne&s;s, by that Man whom He hath ordained; whereof He hath given a&s;&s;urance unto all men in that He hath rai&s;ed him from the dead <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act. 17.</NOTE> The LORD JESUS CHRIST being revealed from Hea|ven, and all the holy Angels with Him, before Him &s;hall be gathered all nations; and as a Jud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> He &s;hall &s;entence them to one or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the&s;e States.

<P><PB N="7" REF="003167_0009_0FF087DFA960A6C0">
AND in one or the other of the&s;e States we mu&s;t all of us, without excep|tion, take up our everla&s;ting abode. For <HI>we mu&s;t all appear before the judgment-&s;eat of CHRIST, that every one may re|ceive the things done in the body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.10.</NOTE>. And GOD hath taught us no|thing of any third or middle State, be|tween the Happine&s;s of Heaven and the Torments of Hell, after the great a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> terrible Day of Judgment is over.</P>
<P>AND &s;ince there are two &s;uch different States of Exi&s;tence for Men after Death, in one or the other of which we mu&s;t all take up our Everla&s;ting abode; why do we not realize the&s;e things, and make them more pre&s;ent to our minds by a lively faith! We profe&s;s to believe them as they are plainly revealed to us in the Go&s;pel: and what is more worthy to be believed und thought on? But after all, how weak is our Faith of them, if we judge by the Influence of it on our Lives? Should we be ju&s;t &s;uch man|ner of per&s;ons if we had a lively appre|hen&s;ion that in a little time we mu&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="003167_0010_0FF087E21CBB2DC8">take up our abode in a State of Ever|la&s;ting De&s;truction and Mi&s;ery, or of Everla&s;ting Life and Happine&s;s? On the one hand, would not the Happine&s;s of Heaven, which is &s;o worthy of the de&s;ire and pur&s;uit of a rea&s;onable Creature, awaken our more &s;ollicitous Cares, and excite our earne&s;t and unwearied Endea|vours to &s;ecure it? On the other hand, would not the Mi&s;ery comprehended in an everla&s;ting De&s;truction fill us with greater Dread and Horror, and make many more among us appear concerned to fly from the Wrath to come, and inqui&s;itive what they &s;hould do to be &s;aved? Where|as, in&s;tead of this, how unconcerned and unaffected are many, that bear the name of Chri&s;tians, about their future State? Who&s;e Lives would rather induce us to think, they know of no Happine&s;s to be de&s;ired, no Mi&s;ery to be feared in another World. O that we may none of us in|dulge this &s;tupid Security, but all more than ever realize this Truth, That in a little time everla&s;ting De&s;truction will be our Portion, unle&s;s we make &s;ure of everla&s;ting Life, before we dye.</P>
<P>LET us therefore make the&s;e two fu|ture States of exi&s;tence the &s;ubject of our frequent and &s;erious Meditation, when we
<PB N="9" REF="003167_0011_0FF087E4A539A5D8">lye down, and when we ari&s;e, and as of|ten as we retire for Devotion. This me|thod will be likely to affect us with a ju&s;t Concern for our mo&s;t important Intere&s;ts; and to excite our utmo&s;t Endeavours to avoid everla&s;ting De&s;truction, and &s;ecure everla&s;ting Life.</P>
<P>AND let none of us any longer defer and put off this Concern about our future State. For this, if any thing in the world, I mean the taking care of our Souls with regard to Eternity, is the one thing need|ful; And through the unde&s;erved Favour of GOD we have yet a Space allowed us, wherein we may do &s;omething to e&s;cape eternal De&s;truction, and lay hold on eternal Life. But if we con&s;ider what a &s;hort and uncertain Space this is, depend|ing at farthe&s;t on the Life of Man, which is but a vapour that appeareth for a lit|tle while, and then vani&s;heth away; I &s;ay, if we con&s;ider this, we &s;hall find it cannot be long before all of us here pre|&s;ent are either &s;aved or damned. And when everla&s;ting De&s;truction and ever|la&s;ting Life depend and turn upon a few Moments with us, we have &s;urely no time for Delay: but whatever our hand findeth to do, we &s;hould do it with our might, making ha&s;te to get ready for the

<P N="2">II. OBSER. <HI>THERE are two diffe|rent</HI> Cour&s;es of Life, <HI>a</HI> wicked <HI>and a</HI> holy <HI>one, which are the</HI> Ways <HI>that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ead to the&s;e two different States of ex|i&s;tence.</HI></P>

For our <HI>manner of life</HI> is com|monly called by the name of <HI>a Way,</HI> in ancient Writers &s;acred and profane; as hath been already remarked. And that a wicked and a good Cour&s;e of Life will end in the&s;e different States of Exi&s;tence, we are a&s;&s;ured from numberle&s;s pa&s;&s;ages of the divine Oracles; all which agree with the Te&s;timony of the in&s;pired A|po&s;tle, Rom. 2. That <HI>in the day when GOD &s;hall judge the &s;ecrets of men by JESUS CHRIST, He will render to e|very man, according to his deeds: to them who by patient continuance in well doing, &s;eek for glory, and honour, and immortali|ty, eternal Life: But unto them that do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>A</HI> wicked <HI>Cour&s;e of Life is the</HI> Way <HI>that leadeth to</HI> De&s;truction.</P>
<P>THEY that <HI>walk after the fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>mind the things of the fle&s;h,</HI> are going down to De&s;truction: <HI>For to be carnally minded is death &mdash; becau&s;e the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t</HI> GOD; <HI>for it is not &s;ub|ject to the Law of</HI> GOD, <HI>neither indeed can be,</HI> Rom. 8.5, 6, 7.

AND yet there is a &s;ort of Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure, on the account of which it may be &s;aid, <HI>wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way, that leadeth to De&s;truction;</HI> and on the account of which <HI>many</HI> are induced to enter into that Way and walk in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WIDE</HI> is the <HI>Gate:</HI> or, <HI>The En|trance into a cour&s;e of Sin is ea&s;y and plea|&s;ant to a carnal heart.</HI> For we are natu|rally prone and inclined to Sin, and have a corrupt Bia&s;s and Di&s;po&s;ition to indulge the <HI>Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;t of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.</HI> As a Fountain naturally ca&s;teth forth water; &s;o from the corrupt Fountain of an evil Heart there naturally flow Streams of Iniquity, which ea&s;y run into any Channel prepared to receive them, or will forceably make one for them&s;elves.

<P>BUT then bad Examples, and wicked &s;ubtle Coun&s;ellors to do evil are not wanting in the World; which falling in with natural Corruption, and the Temp|tations of Satan, render the Entrance into any Cour&s;e of Sin &s;till more ea&s;y; and

<P>IT often happens indeed, that Con&s;ci|ence will check a man, when he is fir&s;t entring upon a Cour&s;e of &s;in; and he is haunted with unea&s;y Mi&s;givings for a while: but yet they who &s;ufficiently know them&s;elves will readily own, That the natural Bent of a Wicked Heart after the Gratification of corrupt Appetites, to|gether with the powerful Influence of Temptations from abroad, do often prove &s;trong enough to overcome the &s;light Mi&s;givings of Con&s;cience, the Exerci&s;e of natural Rea&s;on, and the Force of moral Swa&s;ion; and make it a plea&s;ant and ea|&s;y thing for a carnal man to enter into a Cour&s;e of Sin, the Way that leadeth to De&s;truction. And</P>
<P N="2">2. As the <HI>Gate is Wide:</HI> &s;o <HI>Broad</HI> is the <HI>Way</HI> that leadeth to De&s;truction; or, <HI>the Continuance and Progre&s;s in a &s;inful Cour&s;e is plea&s;ant and ea&s;y to a carnal Heart.</HI></P>
<P>IN a life of Sin, there are &s;o many things to be met with, &s;uite to the evil Appetiles and Inclinations of men, as make it indeed the <HI>Broad Way;</HI> 'tis plain ea&s;y grateful and plea&s;ant; and the
<PB N="24" REF="003167_0026_0FF0880D83CC6598">Continuance in it is even more ea&s;y than the Entrance into it: as the <HI>Way</HI> is broad|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er than the <HI>Gate,</HI> which opens into it.</P>
<P>IN this Way, how different &s;oever the vicious Inclinations of Men may be, ac|cording to their different Tempers, Ages, Conditions and Employments; and what|ever Changes Men are liable to in any of the&s;e re&s;pects; there is a Variety of Paths to &s;uit them all, and offer &s;omething plea|&s;ant and agreeable to them, while they indulge the De&s;ires of their own Hearts. And a man may chu&s;e what Path he will: he may walk in <HI>the ways of his heart, and in the &s;ight of his eyes;</HI> than which there is nothing more plea&s;ant and agreeable to corrupt Nature; which hates Re&s;traint, and loves to think, &s;peak, and act with a mo&s;t licentious Liberty. This way af|fords no Rules or Maxims to abridge a man of taking his Fill of the Plea&s;ures of Sin, and indulging every Appetite: Or a man may exchange the Kinds of Sin, according to his own corrupt Inclination, leaving one for the &s;ake of another, which is grown more plea&s;ing to him; for in the broad Road to De&s;truction a man is not bound always to walk in one parti|cular Path of Sin; but he may keep this, or take another, and there is a Liberty of
<PB N="25" REF="003167_0027_0FF08810197011D8">changing, as he plea&s;es: Or to con&s;ult his Intere&s;t or Reputation, he has in this Way a Liberty of cloaking Sin; he may forbear the open Practice of Sin, and in|dulge him&s;elf in the &s;ecret Commi&s;&s;ion JO it, while he wears a Cloak and outward Shew of Religion; he is at liber|ty to put on Hypocri&s;y, if he cannot &s;o well an&s;wer his ends, in the open and undi&s;gui&s;ed Practice of Sin. Now what a broad and plea&s;ant Way mu&s;t this be to a Carnal Heart, which allows Men a Liberty of running to the highe&s;t Degrees of Sin, or changing the Kinds of it, or co all with a Cloak of Religion, ju&s;t as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>THEN again, in this Way that leadeth to De&s;truction, however men are after|terwards convinced of their Mi&s;take, yet when they have entred into the wide Gate, the Way before them looks very plea&s;ant; like a plain broad Road at a di&s;tance, promi&s;ing abundance of Enter|tainment, Delight, and Satisfaction. And "the further Progre&s;s is made in it, the more plea&s;ant it oftentimes appears; the Evils and Dangers of it are le&s;s ob&s;erved, and the Love of Sin grows with the Prac|ti&s;e of it: the more habituated men are to an evil Cour&s;e, the Checks of Con&s;cience

And at the &s;ame time that the Way grows plea&s;anter to a wicked Heart, the Difficulty of returning becomes greater; which encourages them to go on &s;till in the cour&s;e they have begun; and they can by no means per|&s;wade them&s;elves to undertake the Diffi|culty of returning."</P>
<P>MOREOVER, in the Way that leadeth to De&s;truction, Men avoid many Hin|drances and Impediments, which are to be met with in the Way of Life; as may be &s;hewn hereafter.

To all which we may add, that in the Way of Sin Men are &s;uited with Com|pany of the &s;ame evil Di&s;po&s;itions and Inclinations with them&s;elves; which makes that Way appear &s;till more ea&s;y and plea&s;ant to them. For</P>

For as Sin is the mo&s;t genuine Plea&s;ure of corrupt Nature; &s;o there is nothing which interferes with, and hinders our darling Gratifications, more than the Practi&s;e of a godly Life: Since 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for any to enter upon this, without giving up and renouncing all the &s;inful Delights of a Wicked life; and engaging at the &s;ame time in the Practi&s;e of things that are mo&s;t contrary and irk&s;ome to corrupt Na|ture: For men mu&s;t not only <HI>cea&s;e to do evil,</HI> which they love, but <HI>learn to do well,</HI> which they have a natural Aver&s;ion to; and how difficult and unea&s;y mu&s;t this be to Sinners?</P>
<P>BUT then the Ca&s;e is often &s;o, that in order to enter into the Way of Godline&s;s, men mu&s;t not only overcome their na|tural Pronene&s;s and Inclination to Sin, but the &s;trong Habits of it, which ari&s;e from inveterate Cu&s;tom, and a long Cour&s;e of Practi&s;e. Now the &s;tronger and more eager our Love and Pur&s;uit of Sin are be|come by the&s;e means, the more difficult and unea&s;y &s;till mu&s;t That be which re|&s;trains and oppo&s;es them: So that for
<PB N="34" REF="003167_0036_0FF08827E3A3F278">Sinners to <HI>deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts,</HI> and enter upon a <HI>&s;ober, righteous and godly life,</HI> nece&s;&s;arily infers much Difficul|ty and Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>AND indeed the Difficulty of it is &s;o great, that the Scriptures repre&s;ent the ab&s;olute Impo&s;&s;ibility of doing it by any Power and Strength of our own, and make the Exerci&s;e of divine Almighty Power nece&s;&s;ary for it. Nothing le&s;s than this can break and open the rocky Hearts of Sinners, and bring forth the Waters of Repentance and godly Sorrow for Sin. The exceeding Greatne&s;s of GOD's mighty Power, which He wrought in CHRIST, when He rai&s;ed. Him from the Dead, and &s;et Him at His own right Hand in the Heavenly Places, is requi&s;ite to make Sinners believe in CHRIST. Nor will any thing le&s;s than this make us the Workman&s;hip of GOD created in CHRIST JESUS to good Works.</P>
<P>'TIS not enought for us to have an external Revelation of the Way that leadeth unto Life; but we mu&s;t have a &s;piritual Di&s;cernment of it, before we can enter into it: whereas this cannot be rightly di&s;cerned, without a &s;upernatural Illumination by the SPIRIT of GOD, to
<PB N="35" REF="003167_0037_0FF0882B0496AEC0">remove the Blindne&s;s of a carnal Mind; and this Illumination is not produced with|out a divine Power and Efficacy to renew and change the Soul in all its Faculties, and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e that Self-denial which CHRIST requires of all His Di&s;ciples. Now this Self-denial includes in it things grievous and unea&s;y to corrupt Nature: for it makes a Sinner renounce his own Will, to govern him&s;elf by the Will of GOD; to renounce his own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s as filthy Rags, and depend wholly on the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, for a Ti|tle to the favour of GOD; and to renounce his darling Plea&s;ures, and be willing to part with the &s;weete&s;t Enjoyments of this Life for CHRIST'S &s;ake. But how grie|vous and unea&s;y &s;oever the&s;e things are to corrupt Nature, the fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on to be learned, if we would for&s;ake the Way that leadeth to De&s;truction, and en|ter into the Way that leadeth unto Life, is that, Mat. 16.24. <HI>If any man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, &amp; take up his Cro&s;s, and follow me.</HI> Our SAVIOUR makes this ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, Matth. 10.37, 38. <HI>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that lov|eth &s;on or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his Cro&s;s, and followeth me is not worthy of
<PB N="36" REF="003167_0038_0FF0883103845848">me.</HI> And as the <HI>Entrance</HI> into a Life of Godline&s;s is difficult and unea&s;y; <HI>Strait is the Gate:</HI> So,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>NARROW</HI> is the <HI>Way</HI> that leadeth unto Life; i. e. <HI>the Continuance &amp; Pro|gre&s;s in a godly Life will nece&s;&s;arily en|gage us to encounter many things trouble|&s;ome and unea&s;y to be born.</HI></P>
<P>BUT here al&s;o the <HI>Way</HI> is not &s;o &s;trait and narrow, as the <HI>Gate</HI> that leads into it; that is, the Continuance and Progre&s;s in the Way of Holine&s;s are not, in &s;ome re&s;pects, &s;o difficult and unea&s;y as the fir&s;t Entrance into it. For they who have a &s;upernatural Principle of Life, in&s;tead of hating the Way of Holine&s;s, are enabled delightfully to chu&s;e and endea|vour after Progre&s;s in it. And then by Continuance and Progre&s;s the Habits of Grace grow &s;tronger and &s;tronger, to o|ver-ballance the Reluctances of Nature, and make the &s;ame Difficulties appear le&s;s and le&s;s continually.</P>
<P>BUT yet there will always be &s;ome Remains of Sin and Corruption in us; and the difficult Duties of Self-denial and Mortification mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed &amp; carried on, to the End of our Lives. And tho' the Practi&s;e thereof may not continue &s;o
<PB N="37" REF="003167_0039_0FF088328CC33A28">difficult, as it was at fir&s;t; yet the Fle&s;h will always reluct again&s;t the Spirit, and the Law in the Members war again&s;t the Law of the Mind: which will be a diffi|cult and unea&s;y Exerci&s;e, too hard for us to go thro' without the continual Influ|ences of the divine Power and Grace. For a Chri&s;tian is for ever denied the li|centious Liberty of following his &s;inful Inclinations, and bound to govern him, &s;elf by the Will of GOD; ab&s;taining from what He forbids, and attending what He requires, tho' ever &s;o irk&s;ome to his cor|rupt Affections. Now this Limitation and Confinement, in a con&s;tant Cour&s;e of Mortification and Self-denial, make the Way that leadeth unto Life a <HI>narrow</HI> Way, and cau&s;e many Difficulties to a|ri&s;e in the Chri&s;tian Cour&s;e; both in re|gard of the <HI>Duties</HI> and <HI>Afflictions</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) 'TIS difficult walking in the Way of Life, in regard of <HI>the Duties to be per|formed</HI> in it, thro' the Cour&s;e of our Lives; which are Faith, Repentance, and New-Obedience.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Faith,</HI> the way of Salvation is &s;o contrived, that a Sinner mu&s;t &s;ee and own him&s;elf indebted for it to the &s;ove|reign Grace of GOD, thro' the Merits of JESUS CHRIST; and receive it with the
<PB N="38" REF="003167_0040_0FF0883418889BF0">deepe&s;t Humility, or not at all. Now for man to maintain a firm A&s;&s;ent to the humbling Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, relating to CHRIST and the Way of Salvation by Him; to empty him&s;elf of him&s;elf; and as a vile loath&s;ome guilty creature, de&s;ti|tute of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Strength, to look to be ju&s;tified and &s;aved only by the free and rich Grace of GOD, thro' the Merits of CHRIST; I &s;ay, to live by &s;uch a Faith in the SON of GOD, is no ea&s;y thing. For &s;o proud a creature as Man, who would fain be ju&s;tified and &s;aved by &s;ome Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own, rather than &s;toop to be beholden altoge|ther to another, mu&s;t find it hard to lay a&s;ide and mortify his high Opinion of him&s;elf. And there is &s;ome of this ac|cur&s;ed Pride of Nature left behind even in true Chri&s;tians: &s;o that they mu&s;t, in the way of Struggle and Warfare, con|tinue to lead a Life of Faith before GOD, and find frequent occa&s;ion for that Prayer, Mar. 9.24. <HI>Lord, help thou mine unbelief.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER difficult Duty to be per|formed, if we would continue and make a Progre&s;s in the narrow Way, is <HI>Repen|tance.</HI> For true Chri&s;tians have &s;o much Corruption left in them, as makes it dif|ficult to maintain a Cour&s;e of Repentance,
<PB N="39" REF="003167_0041_0FF08835CB4EAF10">that it may have its perfect Work. They have &s;o much Prone&s;s to &s;in, Self-Love, and Pride, as make it difficult and unea|&s;y to examine their Lives and find out their Sins; to confe&s;s them in all their Ag|gravations, and judge them&s;elves before GOD; to humble them&s;elves in the Du&s;t and take Shame to them&s;elves, on the account of them. Where there is &s;o much remaining Corruption, who can think it an ea&s;y matter entirely to take off our Hearts from Sin, and form &s;tedfa&s;t Re&s;o|lutions to for&s;ake it? Re&s;olutions never more to harbour any Sin, tho' ever &s;o plea&s;ant; or embrace any Temptation, tho' ever &s;o urgent; but that we will cleave to the LORD in all holy Obedi|ence to HisWill. And 'tis more difficult &s;till to put the&s;e Re&s;olutions into Practi&s;e, than to make them: But yet if we conti|nue &amp; make a Progre&s;s in the narrow Way, we mu&s;t lead a Life of &s;uch Repentance.</P>
<P>Non is it &s;o ea&s;y a thing, as &s;ome may imagine, to maintain a Cour&s;e of <HI>Evan|gelical Obedience.</HI> For, on the one hand, to be <HI>dying daily to Sin;</HI> to contradict the De&s;ires of the Fle&s;h &amp; of the Mind, which are as pre&s;&s;ing &amp; urgent, as they are irre|gular; to reduce licentious Appetites under the Government of Rea&s;on and Re|ligion;
<PB N="40" REF="003167_0042_0FF0883B48B83168">to for&s;ake the mo&s;t delightful Ways of Sin, and mortify the mo&s;t belov|ed darling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ts; this is a very difficult and unea&s;y Work indeed: like the cut|ting off a right Hand, or the plucking out a right Eye.

<P>AND be&s;ides the&s;e, many are the <HI>Afflictions</HI> of the Righteous.

<P N="1">(1.) <HI>THESE &s;uppo&s;ed Advantages are exceeding mean and low in them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Gratification of Lu&s;t in the Practi&s;e of Sin, it may be con&s;idered with re&s;pect to the more <HI>&s;en&s;ual</HI> or the more <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Sins: in one of which Men do but partake of the Felicity of Bruits; and in the other they make them|&s;elves more like the Devils.</P>

<PB N="53" REF="003167_0055_0FF0885F70867088">of Happine&s;s in the Way of Moral Go|vernment; and therefore the Happine&s;s they enjoy, how low and mean &s;oever it is, &s;ince it an&s;wers the End of their Being, and employs the Faculties wherewith their Maker has endowed them, is not incon&s;iderable. Whereas for <HI>Men</HI> to a|bandon them&s;elves to &s;en&s;ual Gratificati|ons as the Center of their Felicity, is to &s;ink beneath their Natures, and by giv|ing their Sen&s;es the Government over the Superiour Faculties of Rea&s;on, to fall un&s;peakably &s;hort of that Happine&s;s for which the Humane Nature is capacitated and de&s;igned.

For however the&s;e may lye more concealed from the View and Ob|&s;ervation of the World; yet they do not in the Sight of GOD, nor ought they in our Eyes to appear le&s;s degrading to our Nature, than a criminal Indulgence to Sen&s;ual Gratifications: which doth ren|der Men more like the Bea&s;ts, than tho&s;e more Spiritual Sins make them like the Devils.

3. <HI>THESE Difficulties and Hard&s;hips are but of a &s;hort Duration.</HI></P>
<P>THE difficult and afflicted Way of Godline&s;s is but &s;hort; comprehended within the Bounds of this Life: which what is it, but a Vapour that appeareth for a little while? And in a very little time the la&s;t Enemy becomes a Friend to the Godly, and puts a Period to all their Afflictions; and to Sin which is the Cau&s;e of them, and it&s;elf the greate&s;t of them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THERE are no Difficulties &amp; Af|flictions to be encountred in the narrow Way of Godline&s;s, but what are ordered for Good, according to the Promi&s;es of the New and Everla&s;ting Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a Covenant ordered in all things, and &s;ure: and according to it, GOD's infinite Wi&s;dom, Power, Goodne&s;s and Faithfulne&s;s, are all engaged for His People, and exerci&s;ed for their good in whatever befalls them. All the Pro|mi&s;es of this Covenant are in CHRIST <HI>Yea, &amp; in Him Amen to the glory of</HI> GOD: <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 1.20.</NOTE> In Him they are all ratified &amp; confirm|ed to the true Chri&s;tian. Let what will befall &s;uch a One, we may re&s;t &s;atisfied, that Good &s;hall come out of Evil. For
<PB N="67" REF="003167_0069_0FF08884DB684BE0"><HI>we know that all things work together for good, to them that love</HI> GOD, <HI>to them that are called according to His purpo&s;e.</HI> Rom 8.28. The Difficulties and Afflictions of the narrow Way can la&s;t but a little Sea&s;on; and while they do continue, they are &s;ub&s;ervient to ble&s;&s;ed Ends and Pur|po&s;es, and work for their good; as they prepare them for a glorious and happy State in the other World. Thus the <HI>con|&s;tant Warfare</HI> between the Fle&s;h and the Spirit is a trouble&s;ome and unea&s;y thing: but it weakens and works out that Cor|ruption which unfits the Soul for Heaven and Glory: and it confirms and &s;trength|ens the Principle of Divine Life, and tho&s;e Habits of Holine&s;s which render the Soul meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. The <HI>Afflictions</HI> &amp; <HI>Temptations</HI> al&s;o which the Godly Encounter <HI>from the ad|ver&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence</HI> are &s;anc|tified for the like de&s;irable Purpo&s;es. For the End of them is to purge out Ini|quity and take away Sin, to prove us and to humble us, and to do us good in the latter End: they tend to quicken us to tho&s;e Duties which are very comfortable to us, as well as honourary to GOD: and they tend to make us Partakers of His Holine&s;s; for they are the Exerci&s;e and Tryal of our Graces, which are thereby
<PB N="68" REF="003167_0070_0FF08886816EFD38">&s;trengthened &amp; increa&s;ed. And they that walk in the narrow Way of Holine&s;s may <HI>greatly rejoyce, though now for a Sea&s;on (if need be) they are in Heavine&s;s through manifold Temptations.</HI> Since it is <HI>That the Tryal of their Faith, being much more precious than of Gold that peri&s;heth, tho' it be tryed in the Fire, may be found unto Prai&s;e and Honour and Glory at the Ap|pearing of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. 1 Pet. 1.6, 7.</P>
<P>THUS if we take a ju&s;t view of the Hard&s;hips and Difficulties of the narrow Way, they do not contain &s;o great an Evil in them, as Men are apt to imagine.</P>
<P>Secondly. THIS is true likewi&s;e, if we take a ju&s;t View of the <HI>Solitarine&s;s</HI> of that Way.</P>
<P>The Smallne&s;s of the Number of tho&s;e who are found Walking in the narrow Way is not &s;o great a Di&s;advantage, as Men are apt to repre&s;ent it to them&s;elves. For tho' there are but Few that find this Way; yet they are the mo&s;t agreeable Company to wife and good Men, who have the highe&s;t Reli&s;h for good Society, and are the be&s;t Judges of it. And tho' their Number is but &s;mall, compared with the Numbers to be found in the broad Way; yet as they have the mo&s;t endear|ing
<PB N="69" REF="003167_0071_0FF088885E27DD28">Qualities for Society; &s;o there is a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">icient Number of them to make the Way of Piety really plea&s;ant and delight|ful, and to countenance, and encourage, and a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in their Progre&s;s in it.</P>
<P>BUT if the narrow Way had not &s;o many in it as it has; yet it can be but a very little while, before it will bring the Travellers in it to an innumerable. Com|pany of Holy Angels, to the General A&s;&s;embly and Church of the Fir&s;t-Born which are written in Heaven, and to GOD the Judge of all, and to JESUS the Medi|ator of the New Covenant in the heaven|ly World.</P>
<P>So then upon a ju&s;t View of the &s;up|po&s;ed Di&s;advantages of the &s;trait Grate, and the narrow Way, there are many Con&s;iderations to le&s;&s;en the Evil of them in our E&s;teem. And</P>

<P>BUT whatever Sen&s;e Men have of the&s;e things, when they come to lie upon a Sick-bed; every Sinner will mo&s;t certainly be convinced, when he comes into the other World. Then will they have nothing to divert them from the&s;e Tho'ts. They will feel that which will be a &s;en&s;ible Demon&s;tra|tion to them of their own Folly. Then will Men cur&s;e tho&s;e fal&s;e &amp; flattering Plea&s;ures which have cheated them into &s;o much Mi&s;ery: but their own Folly mo&s;t of all for being &s;o ea&s;ily abu&s;ed. Then would they give Ten Thou&s;and Worlds, if they had them, to recover the Opportunity of a new Choice; but it cannot be: they parted with their Souls once at a cheap rate;
<PB N="83" REF="003167_0085_0FF088AEF8BE7D40">but no Price will then be accepted for the Redemption of them.</P></Q>
<P>Now then be per&s;waded, O Sinner, to regard the folemn Warnings of GOD; while Life and Death are &s;et before you for your Choice, and you are compa&s;&s;io|nately called upon to chu&s;e Life. Your Mini&s;ters, if they have any Faithfulne&s;s to GOD and Love to your Souls cannot, without an aking Heart, behold you walk|ing or running with full &s;peed in the broad Way, which leadeth down to De|&s;truction. Nay, their own Souls are very nearly concerned in this matter. We read, Ezek. 33. 7, 8, 9.&mdash; <HI>O &s;on of man, I have &s;et thee a Watchman to the hou&s;e of I&s;rael: therefore thou &s;halt hear the word from my mouth and warn them from me. When I &s;ay to the wicked, O wicked man, thou &s;halt &s;urely die; if thou do&s;t not &s;peak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man &s;hall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand. Ne|verthele&s;s, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it: if he do not turn from his way, he &s;hall die in his iniquity, but thou ha&s;t delivered thy Soul.</HI> Even &s;o we, who are the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, are ap|pointed Watchmen; and we cannot be faithful to Him, nor deliver our own Souls,

But we cannot be &s;o void of Com|pa&s;&s;ion to you, if you are to us. Where|fore as we <HI>&s;ay to the Righteous, that it &s;hall be well with him; for they &s;hall eat the fruit of their doings:</HI> &s;o we mu&s;t &s;ay it for your &s;akes, and we will &s;ay it for our own, <HI>Woe unto the Wicked it &s;hall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands &s;hall be given him.</HI> I&s;ai. 3.10, 11.</P>
<P>AND O that we might be the happy In&s;truments of &s;aving your Souls from Death and De&s;truction; by converting you from the Error of your Way, and bringing you into the Way that leadeth unto Life! As GOD calls, <HI>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye dye;</HI> and JESUS CHRIST

<P><PB N="86" REF="003167_0088_0FF088B7D0C939D8">
BUT I am aware of it, that the great Adver&s;ary is always ready with his Im|pediments to hinder your turning out of the Way that leadeth to De&s;truction, and entring into the Path of GOD's Command|ments; and to di&s;courage you from u&s;ing any Means in order unto this. For which end he will be forward to fall in with your depraved Di&s;po&s;itions, by &s;ug|ge&s;ting Objections to defeat the mo&s;t powerful and moving Arguments and Exhortations. And particularly with re|gard to the Exhortation which has been pur&s;ued at this time, you may be tempted to excu&s;e or di&s;courage your&s;elves in the Language of this</P>
<P>OBJECTION. <HI>THE Conver&s;ion to</HI> GOD <HI>by which we mu&s;t enter in at the Strait Gate, is a thing wholly out of our own Power, and depends entirely on the &s;uper|natural Grace of</HI> GOD, <HI>and tho&s;e Influen|ces of His</HI> SPIRIT <HI>which are di&s;pen&s;ed according to His &s;overeign Plea&s;ure: Why then do you thus urge and per&s;wade us to enter in at the Strait Gate, as if we could Change our own Hearts, and Convert our &s;elves to</HI> GOD? This I doubt not, is an Objection whereby Satan has di&s;couraged many awakened Souls, and defeated the
<PB N="87" REF="003167_0089_0FF088BA090B8958">holy Coun&s;els that have been given to them. And 'tis likely to have the great|er Force and Influence upon you, becau&s;e it &s;eems naturally to ari&s;e from tho&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ages of the &s;acred Scripture which repre&s;ent the &s;piritual Impotency of unrege|nerate Sinners, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of di|vine Grace in Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN An&s;wer to this Objection, I will not endeavour to repre&s;ent your natural Condition as le&s;s mi&s;erable than indeed it is. In&s;tead of exalting humane Liber|ty, and the Power of Man's Free-will to &s;piritual Good; as is done in &s;ome mo|dern and modi&s;h Schemes, which for the &s;ake of that Idol will dethrone the Grace of GOD: I &s;ay, in&s;tead of this, let it be reckoned a faithful Saying, That while unconverted you are dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins; and as unable to produce that Principle of &s;piritual Life in your Souls which is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;aving Conver&s;ion, as a Man under the power of natural Death, is unable to give him&s;elf a Principle of natural Life and Action. Nor can I con|ceive, with what Sen&s;e and Meaning they who deny this, can put you upon making &s;uch Trayers to GOD as that, <HI>Turn thou me and I &s;hall be turned.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="003167_0090_0FF088BC9C03A950">
BUT notwith&s;tanding all this, the Ob|jection propo&s;ed has no Force in it. For when Sinners in Scripture are exhorted to <HI>turn them&s;elves,</HI> and <HI>make them&s;elves a new Heart,</HI> and the like, 'tis evident by com|paring &s;uch Exhortations with other Texts of Scripture, that the De&s;ign of them is to &s;et forth the Sinners Duty, and the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Conver&s;ion in order to Salvati|on; to bring men to a Sen&s;e of their Mi|&s;erable Impotency; and to put them up|on Seeking to GOD that He would change their Hearts, and turn them to Him&s;elf. And &s;o when we &s;et before you the Mi|&s;ery and Danger of your State in the broad Way of Sin, and exhort you to for&s;ake it, and to enter in at the &s;trait Gate &amp; walk in the narrow Way, we do not urge and per&s;wade you, as if you could change your own Hearts and convert your &s;elves. But who can tell, whether the Spirit of Life from GOD will not enter into your dead Souls with &s;uch Exhortations? And we hope, that being awakened to &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of a new Heart in order to your Happine&s;s, and your own Inability to produce it in your &s;elves, you will en|quire after the Way to obtain it, and &s;eek it of GOD; by attending tho&s;e Means of Grace in the diligent U&s;e of which it of|ten plea&s;es Him to be&s;tow it.

<P>I think the plain State of the Ca&s;e may be laid down in the following Particu|lars.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. IF ever you are &s;aved, that Redemp|tion which CHRIST has purcha&s;ed, mu&s;t be effectually applied unto you, by the SPIRIT of GOD, in true Conver&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. GOD hath been plea&s;ed to appoint certain Means, in the U&s;e of which He will be &s;ought unto, and waited on for the gracious Influences of His SPIRIT, which are nece&s;&s;ary in order to this Con|ver&s;ion. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. 'TIS in your Power, while uncon|verted, to attend tho&s;e Means of Grace &s;e|riou&s;ly, tho' not with a gracious Sincerity: &s;uch as Reading and Hearing GOD'S Word, Meditation, and Prayer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. IF you <HI>do not</HI> thus &s;eek to GOD, and wait on him in the U&s;e of tho&s;e Means, you can have no grounds to hope for His converting Grace: but If you <HI>do,</HI> you are in the Way of this Ble&s;&s;ing; for when they are diligently attended, GOD is often plea&s;ed to accompany tho&s;e out|ward Means with the &s;aving Influences of HIS SPIRIT.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="90" REF="003167_0092_0FF088C03797C408">
V. 'TIS therefore the greate&s;t Folly imaginable for you not to wait upon GOD in this Way. For, What? though you cannot find any nece&s;&s;ary Connection be|tween the U&s;e of the outward Means and converting Grace? Neither can you, between the Means u&s;ed by the Husband|man and a plentiful Harve&s;t; for after all he mu&s;t depend on the Ble&s;&s;ing of divine Provi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce, which is not always granted: and yet you call it extreme Folly in an Husbandman, who depends on a Harve&s;t for his Livelihood, not to u&s;e the Means in order to it; becau&s;e without u&s;ing the Means, 'tis the vaine&s;t Pre&s;umption to expect a Harve&s;t. In like manner, it mu&s;t be the extreme&s;t Folly in you that have nothing but the &s;overeign Grace of GOD to depend on for the Life and Salvation of your Souls, not to wait on Him in the u&s;e of the Means of Grace: &s;ince in the neglect of tho&s;e Means, 'tis the vaine&s;t Pre&s;umption to expect that Ble&s;&s;ing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. NOR can you pretend, that you have not <HI>&s;ufficient Incouragement to hold on</HI> &s;eek|ing to GOD, and waiting on Him, in the U&s;e of the Means of Grace. For tho' I cannot &s;ay, you have any Covenanti-Pro|mi&s;e to plead for your Succe&s;s in the U&s;e of them; yet they are the only appointed

<P>WHEREFORE in&s;tead of going aboue to excu&s;e your &s;elves, or &s;inking under a|ny Di&s;couragements from the Con&s;idera|tion of your own Impotency, be per|&s;waded to &s;hake off your Slothfulne&s;s, and concern your &s;elves in earne&s;t about the eternal Intere&s;ts of your precious and immortal Souls.
