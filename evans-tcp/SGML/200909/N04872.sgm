<HEAD>A LETTER TO Mr. JEDIDIAH MILLS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is commonly ob&s;erved, (and perhaps ju&s;tly) that young Authors are impatient to hear, what Opinion the World entertains of their fir&s;t Performance. I hope therefore, that you will take it in good Part, that I let you know what E&s;teem I have of your fir&s;t Piece, intitled, <HI>A Vindica|tion of Go&s;pel-Truth,</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; Perhaps you might have been better pleas'd, if the Doctor to whom you directed it, had undertaken this Work him&s;elf. And the only Apology that I can make for his &s;eeming Neglect, is this; that as St. <HI>Paul</HI> directed the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> 1 Cor. vi. 4. when they had any Controver&s;y about temporal Affairs, <HI>to &s;et them to judge and determine them who were lea&s;t e&s;teemed in the Church,</HI> becau&s;e it was an Office too mean for tho&s;e of the highe&s;t Form: &s;o it is our Method in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to appoint Men of the &s;malle&s;t Talents to repul&s;e the feeble&s;t A&s;&s;aults, while tho&s;e of the Doctor's Abilities are better employ'd. &mdash; However, though I can't afford you that Honour, which a Reply from the Doctor would have done you; yet this I dare engage, that no Man can treat you with greater Integrity and Openne&s;s of Heart than I &s;hall do. And to begin, without Flattery I can a&s;&s;ure you, that I e&s;teem your Performance as to the Sub&s;tance of it to be perfect|ly unan&s;werable; and that you have demon&s;trated the main Propo&s;ition you undertook to prove beyond all Po&s;&s;ibility of a Contradiction. And I don't think, that ever any Body to the
<PB N="6" REF="006093_0004_102783E6DF968C40">End of Time will be found &s;o unrea&s;onable, as to attempt to di&s;prove it; and that becau&s;e no Man yet &s;ince the Creation ever denied it. For you tell us, that you <Q>grant, there are conditional Promi&s;es in the Scriptures to Sinners.</Q> P. 10. Now this is the utmo&s;t that tho&s;e whom you call <HI>Arminians</HI> pre|tend to.</P>
<P>But what you contend for, you &s;ay, is this, That <HI>there are no Promi&s;es of the Be&s;towment of &s;pecial Grace, made in the Scripture to unregenerate Sinners, on Condition of any Endeavours, Strivings, or Doings of theirs what&s;oever.</HI> P. 10. Now, fair Di&s;putants who fear not the Light becau&s;e their Tenets are evil, always take Care, when they &s;tate their Que&s;tion, to explain their Terms.&mdash; But you have left yours in the utmo&s;t Ambiguity: By which Means you began, continued, and ended the Di&s;pute in the Clouds. And though I have read over your Letter &s;e|veral Times, with the utmo&s;t Attention I am capable of; yet I am really at a Lo&s;s to know what you would have us believe in the Affair. For,</P>
<P N="1">I. By &s;pecial Grace the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> mean tho&s;e Operations of the Holy Spirit upon our Souls which will irre&s;i&s;tably and un|fru&s;trably bring them to Heaven. Now if you u&s;e the Words <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> in this Sen&s;e (as no Doubt you do) then you mean, that GOD has no where promi&s;ed to be&s;tow irre&s;i&s;table Grace upon unconverted Men, whatever Pains they may take for it.</P>
<P>And I dare be Surety for every <HI>Arminian</HI> in the Nation, that he will join with you. For they are &s;o far from believing that GOD has promi&s;ed &s;pecial Grace in this Sen&s;e to Sinners for any Endeavours of theirs, that they believe he has not pro|mi&s;ed it all, either conditionally, or unconditionally, either to Saints or Sinners. But,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> The Terms <HI>Special Grace</HI> do properly &s;ignify tho&s;e pe|culiar Favours and Privileges which belong only to good Men; &s;uch as the Pardon of Sin, the peculiar Guidance and Comforts of the Holy Gho&s;t, and a Right to eternal Happine&s;s. Now if your Propo&s;ition be under&s;tood in this Sen&s;e, you mu&s;t mean, that there are no Promi&s;es in the holy Bible, declaring that GOD will give Pardon and eternal Life, to wicked Men, while they remain &s;uch, notwith&s;tanding any Endeavours of theirs which come &s;hort of a &s;incere Compliance with the Terms of Salvation. And I am per&s;uaded there is no Man living, but who will join with you in this. I am therefore humbly of the
<PB N="7" REF="006093_0005_102783EB6927FAF0">Opinion, that you had no more Occa&s;ion to write &s;o largely to prove it, than to &s;pend Two Years in proving that Light is not Darkne&s;s. Indeed Brother, if in&s;tead of proving that GOD has not promi&s;ed &s;pecial, <HI>i.e.</HI> irre&s;i&s;table Grace to the Unregene|rate for any Doings of theirs, you had proved that he has promi&s;ed &s;uch Grace at all; or that it is nece&s;&s;ary to Conver&s;ion; or that com|mon and preventing Grace rightly improved will never end in &s;a|ving Grace; this would have been to the Purpo&s;e; this would have been a <HI>Refutation</HI> of the Doctor's Errors, whom you pretend to an&s;|wer, and a Confirmation of Mr. <HI>Cook's</HI> Sermon, which you profe&s;s to defend. But in&s;tead of this, you have feigned &s;uch an Adver|&s;ary, as never exi&s;ted but in your own Imagination; And this chimerical Antagoni&s;t you have manfully attack'd, irre&s;i&s;tably conquered, and mo&s;t unmercifully triumph'd over and expos'd to Shame. You have taken much Pains to <HI>refute dangerous Errors,</HI> and an&s;wer weak Objections, which never had any being, before you dream'd of them; and I dare &s;ay would have lain in their Non-Entity to Eternity, had it not been for the creative Power of your Fancy.</P>
<P>By an <HI>unregenerate</HI> Man, you mean, one who does not con&s;ent to the Terms of Salvation. And by <HI>&s;pecial Grace,</HI> you mean, Salvation begun and &s;ecured, &s;o that it cannot be lo&s;t. Therefore to &s;ay, that an unregenerate Man has a Promi&s;e of &s;pecial Grace for &s;ome Doings of his, while he remains unregenerate, is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, that a wicked Man has the Promi&s;e of Salvation, while he remains wicked, for &s;ome wicked Doings of his; or at lea&s;t, for &s;ome Endeavours of his, which have not the lea&s;t Degree of moral Goodne&s;s in them. It is the &s;ame, as to &s;ay, that a Man has GOD's Promi&s;e for Salvation, although he does not comply with the Condition of the Promi&s;e. That it was your great De&s;ign to di&s;prove this Error, not only your &s;tating the Que&s;tion, but the whole Strain of your Rea&s;oning &s;hews. &mdash; And can you, Sir, in earne&s;t believe, that the Doctor, or any Man living entertains &s;uch an Opinion as this? For this is to believe, that both Parts of a Con|tradiction are true; that a Man may be regenerate, and unregenerate at the &s;ame Time and in the &s;ame Sen&s;e; and that he may have a Covenant-Right to Salvation; and yet never con&s;ent to the Terms of Salvation propounded in the Covenant of Grace.</P>
<P>You tell us in your Preface, that this is a <HI>Covenant of Man's own devi&s;ing;</HI> and I heartily join with you, and give you the
<PB N="8" REF="006093_0006_102783ECFB419610">Honour of this <HI>new <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Covenant,</HI> for I profe&s;s, I believe no Man ever hit upon this new Device, but only Mr. <HI>Mills.</HI> And to be &s;erious with you, with what Con&s;cience could you charge &s;uch wretched Whims upon the Doctor? And pray with what Hone&s;ty could you feign your&s;elf &s;o horribly affrighted at him, as to make that hideous Outcry P. 32, where you expre&s;s your&s;elf thus: <HI>Here, Sir, being &s;truck with the utmo&s;t Surprize, I mu&s;t beg leave to pau&s;e a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, as not able &s;uddenly to re&s;olve what is be&s;t to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> &amp;c. If one of the infernal Spirits had ap|pear'd to you, could you have expre&s;t your Amazement in &s;tronger Terms? I may venture to appeal to all who know the Force of Language, whether the obvious Meaning of your Words be not this? the Doctor is &s;uch a Prodigy for Here&s;y or Villainy, that to read a few of his Lines is enough to &s;trike one's Soul with Amazement. Whatever you may think of it, Sir, this is but a very mean, tho' an effectual Method of &s;lander|ing.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve the like In&s;tance of your Uncharitable|ne&s;s towards the Doctor in Page 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. where you undertake to acquaint the World what was the Occa&s;ion of the <HI>Doctor's</HI> writ|ing upon this Subject, which according to you was this, there has lately been a wonderful Sea&s;on for the Conver&s;ion of Souls from Satan to Chri&s;t, and va&s;t Numbers have in a &s;hort Time experienced a ble&s;&s;ed Change of their Hearts from Sin to Holine&s;s, by the Grace of GOD. This nettled the Doctor to &s;ee Religion flouri&s;h &s;o wonderfully, he thought it was high Time to be&s;tir him&s;elf; and try to put a Stop to the Growth of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, as it is &s;aid of the Devil, Rev. xii. 12. <HI>He had great Wrath becau&s;e he knew, that he had but a &s;hort Time.</HI> I will appeal to any Per&s;on who can di&s;cover a Man's Meaning by his Words if this be not the genuine Sen&s;e of that Page.</P>
<P>And if your &s;o much boa&s;ted Conver&s;ions produce no bet|ter Fruits among your People, than this horrible Cen&s;oriou&s;|ne&s;s in their Mini&s;ter, I'll venture to &s;ay of all &s;uch as <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;aid of <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Levi; O my Soul come not thou into their Secret, unto their A&s;&s;embly mine Honour be not thou united. Cur&s;ed be their</HI> Uncharitablene&s;s <HI>for it is fierce, and their</HI> Cen&s;oriou&s;|ne&s;s <HI>for it is cruel.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctor had told you his Motive to write, but you pretend to know his Heart, better than he him&s;elf did. And you won't allow <HI>GOD alone to know the Hearts of the Children
<PB N="9" REF="006093_0007_102783F0035C69A0">of Men.</HI>&mdash;I am con&s;cious to my &s;elf of great Guilt towards GOD. and my Neighbour; but I &s;olemnly profe&s;s, I would not be guilty of &s;uch a venemous Piece of Reviling, e&s;pecially again&s;t one &s;o remarkable for a benevolent and catholic Spirit as the Doctor is, for all the Applau&s;e your Performance has gained you among People of your own Humour.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there was no manner of Occa&s;ion for this virulent and ill-natur'd Stroke: For the late Confu&s;ion in this Country, &s;ince Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Journey through it, called a <HI>wonderful Revival of Religion,</HI> has occa&s;ioned ten Per&s;ons coming over to our Side of the Que&s;tion, to one who has de&s;erted it for yours. But I'm afraid this cen&s;uring and judging Men's Hearts, is no new Practice with you: becau&s;e you are &s;o very ready to drag it in Head and Shoulders, without the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion. &mdash; Becau&s;e I intend not to be tedious. I &s;hall &s;ay no more of your Cen&s;oriou&s;|ne&s;s, and only mention one In&s;tance out of many of your In|con&s;i&s;tencies. You tell us, P. 10. that the Go&s;pel gives <HI>great and precious Encouragements</HI> to unconverted Men to <HI>endeavour, &s;trive, and do:</HI> and that the&s;e <HI>Encouragements</HI> ri&s;e in Proportion to their Diligence and Painfulne&s;s in doing good Works; this is certainly your Meaning, or you have no Meaning at all. And yet you tell us P. 56. and in many other Places, that it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for the&s;e unconverted Sinners by the be&s;t Improvement of common Grace, to do one Work that has any moral Good|ne&s;s in it, or that GOD can approve of. This too is evidently your Meaning. Now, Brother, pray tell me for the &s;ake of common Sen&s;e, how tho&s;e Works which have no moral Good in them; but are &s;inful, di&s;approved and abhorred by GOD, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to intitle the Doer of them to <HI>great and precious Encouragements</HI> from GOD? Nay, that the <HI>Encouragements</HI> &s;hould <HI>ri&s;e in Proportion,</HI> as the Sinner abounds in doing the&s;e im|moral and &s;inful Deeds? This is a Paradox, which &s;urpa&s;&s;es my Comprehen&s;ion. &mdash; Your Brethren, who were the chief Pro|moters of the late glorious Work in this Land, of which you boa&s;t &s;o much, were not of your Mind, when they told di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People, that <HI>their Prayers and Cries for Mercy were as di&s;agreeable to GOD as the Howlings of the Devils. And that he who lives in all kinds of Wickedne&s;s, &s;tands a better Chance for Salvation than he who complies with the whole of his Duty &s;incerely.</HI> I have heard one of the mo&s;t &s;ober and mode&s;t of the&s;e Reformers declare to his Hearers, <HI>that there were many good and hone&s;t Men among them, who know nothing of GOD and Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> The&s;e Men are
<PB N="10" REF="006093_0008_102783F350A2AAC0">throughout of a Piece: but you can blow both hot and cold in &s;uch a &s;trange Manner, that I profe&s;s I know not what your Faith really is. But this I am &s;ure of, that &s;ince you hold, that both the Works of the unconverted are very valuable and have <HI>great and precious Encouragements</HI> annext to them; and yet are &s;o vile and contemptible that there is not any moral Goodne&s;s in the be&s;t of them, you are certainly mi&s;taken on one Side or the other: becau&s;e both Parts of a Contradiction can't be true.</P>
<P>But to return, Though as you have laid down your chief Pro|po&s;ition, every one will agree in the Truth of it; yet when you have made &s;ome Progre&s;s in your Di&s;cour&s;e, you attempt to prove much more than is contained in your fir&s;t A&s;&s;ertion: viz. That there is no Certainty from the holy Scripture, that GOD will enable the &s;triving Sinner to comply with the Terms of Salvation. For whereas our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;ays, Matth. xxv. 29. <HI>Unto every on that hath &s;hall be given, and he &s;hall have Abundance. By this Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> you &s;ay is <HI>meant the final Re|ward of Glory is the future World.</HI> P. 26. Hence you infer, that it is no Promi&s;e that a weary and heavy laden Sinner, &s;triving ever &s;o earne&s;tly &s;hall be enabled to come to Chri&s;t. &mdash; To which I an&s;wer, though it be the De&s;ign of the Parable of the Talents to repre&s;ent the Manner of the final Judgment; yet it is corrupting the Word of GOD, to confine this Aphori&s;m to that, and to &s;ay, that it does not import our receiving further Degree of Grace in this World, according to the Improvement we make of what we have received already. For it is a general Propo&s;ition, and is fulfill'd in ten thou&s;and In&s;tances be&s;ides the final Judgment. Thus he who <HI>hath</HI> Rea&s;on, and improves it well, &s;hall <HI>have more</HI> and &s;hall grow in Under&s;tanding. He <HI>who hath</HI> a Memory, and u&s;es it well &s;hall have it enlarged. What ever Talent a Man hath, if he improves it well, he &s;hall have it inlarged and rewarded. So he who hath the common pre|venting Grace of the Holy Spirit, and improves it by complying with GOD's Will as far as he is able, and who cannot do what he is able to do?) this Man has Chri&s;t's expre&s;s Declaration, that his Grace &s;hall be increa&s;ed into an <HI>Abundance.</HI> And if a Man <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ued with an Abundance of Grace cannot perform one <HI>gra|cious Action,</HI> or do one &s;ingle Thing plea&s;ing to GOD, it mu&s;t be a very &s;trange Sort of Grace indeed, not worth a having. &mdash; It is agreed on both Sides, that there is &s;uch a Thing as common Grace, or the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">luences of the Holy Spirit upon all Men under the Go&s;pel, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ch only excepted as for their Ob&s;tinacy are
<PB N="11" REF="006093_0009_102783F65438D588">abandoned, having finally quench'd the Spirit.) And this Grace is given antecedently to any <HI>Seekings, Endeavours or Doings</HI> of ours. Now this Grace mu&s;t be allowed to be a Talent im|proveable; otherwi&s;e it is no Grace, or Favour. And if it be a Talent, he who improves it, is expre&s;ly intitled by a Promi&s;e to <HI>Abundance</HI> of Grace. And he who has a Abundance of Grace, I humbly conceive, is in a State of Acceptance with GOD; and has what we mean by the Terms <HI>&s;pecial Grace;</HI> though not irre&s;i&s;tible. Now to have Abundance of Grace, and yet be a wicked Man, is &s;omething like the Thing called a <HI>Bull.</HI></P>
<P>Again, when our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;ays Matth. 7.7. <HI>a&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you; And GOD will give his Holy Spirit to them that a&s;k him.</HI> You will not allow this Promi&s;e, to belong to any, but &s;uch as have already complied with the Terms of Salvation; No others however de&s;irous to plea&s;e GOD, have any Right to it. And your Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e this a&s;king mu&s;t be in <HI>unfeigned Faith,</HI> and none but converted Per&s;ons have this Faith, P. 29. But, pray, how do you prove, that a Man who has not as yet &s;incerely devoted him&s;elf to Chri&s;t, may not have this true Faith the next Moment, and be able to a&s;k aright; provided he will exert all that Strength which common and preventing Grace &s;upplies him with? And if this be the Ca&s;e, the Promi&s;e be|longs to him. And that it is &s;o, is very evident; for to &s;ay, that he who is now unconverted cannot by GOD's preventing Grace, while he a&s;ks, &s;eeks, and knocks in the be&s;t Manner (to him po&s;&s;ible,) become a good Man, is to affirm, that Men who remain wicked continue &s;uch, not through any Default of their own, but becau&s;e GOD will not give them &s;ufficient A&s;|&s;i&s;tance; which is to charge their Impenitency on GOD. For who can blame the Man that does the utmo&s;t that he can? And indeed, this is all that GOD requires of us, that we &s;hould love and &s;erve him with all our Strength. And verily, If a Man has no more than our common Grace, and improves it as well as he po&s;&s;ibly can, I do not &s;ee why he &s;hould not be as acceptable to GOD, who is no Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons, as if he had your &s;pecial Grace. For he who has your <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> can do no more than he can, which he that has common Grace is &s;uppo&s;ed to do. And <HI>when Chri&s;t &s;ays, a&s;k, and ye &s;hall re|ceive; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find;</HI> it is a Command, and Promi&s;e to every one, good and bad, who hears the Go&s;pel. And it is your Pre&s;umption to limit it, and confine it to godly Per&s;ons.
<PB N="12" REF="006093_0010_102783F7D718F6C0">By which Device you make our gracious Redeemer &s;peak in this in&s;incere and di&s;&s;embling Manner. <HI>A&s;k, and ye &s;hall receive; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be opened to you; and GOD will give his Spirit to them that a&s;k.</HI> <Q>But while I utter the&s;e gracious Words, I have this mental Re&s;ervation, provided you a&s;k in <HI>Faith unfeigned,</HI> which alas poor Wretches, you can no more do, than create a World. You imagine now my Hearers that I direct you, how to become good Men, and obtain eternal Life; but there is nothing farther from my real Intentions. I only put you upon doing Im|po&s;&s;ibilities.</Q> Now is it not a &s;oul Imputation upon the holy Je&s;us, in who&s;e Mouth was no Guile, to &s;uppo&s;e he would &s;et Men to do Impo&s;&s;ibilities, in order to obtain Salvation, under the Pretence of pointing out to them the right Way to eternal Life? No Man of common Hone&s;ty would endure &s;uch a Re|proach to be ca&s;t upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Again you tell us, P. 41. <HI>That the Suppo&s;ition of any true moral Excellency and &s;olid Goodne&s;s in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible Doings of the Unregenerate while &s;uch, is but a meer Dream and vain Imagina|tion.</HI> This is your grand Argument, and runs through the whole, I &s;hall therefore give it a &s;hort, but full An&s;wer.</P>
<P N="1">1. If by this you mean, that all which a wicked Man does, while he refu&s;es to comply with the Terms of Salvation, will not intitle him to the &s;pecial Favour of GOD; this is what no body denies, or needs to be taught. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. If by this you mean, that a Man who is not thoroughly good, never does what in any Degree is plea&s;ing to GOD, and morally good; you are mi&s;taken: For <HI>Ahab</HI> was a very wicked Man; yet &s;ome of his Actions had a Degree of moral Goodne&s;s in them; and were in &s;ome Mea&s;ure plea&s;ing to God. 1 Kings xxi. 29. <HI>See&s;t thou how Ahab humbleth him&s;elf before me? Becau&s;e he humbleth him&s;elf before me, I will not bring the Evil in his Days: But in his Sons Days I will bring the Evil upon his Hou&s;e.</HI> If <HI>Ahab</HI>'s Behaviour had had no moral Good|ne&s;s in it, GOD would not have taken &s;uch Notice of it; nor have &s;o rewarded it. The like is evident in <HI>Jehu,</HI> 2 Kings x. 30, 31. <HI>And the Lord &s;aid unto Jehu, Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t done well in executing that which was right in mine Eyes, and ha&s;t done unto the Hou&s;e of Ahab according to all that was in mine Heart, thy Children of the fourth Generation &s;hall &s;it upon the Throne of I&s;rael. But Jehu took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord GOD of I&s;rael with all his Heart.</HI> If <HI>Jehu</HI>'s Conduct
<PB N="13" REF="006093_0011_102783F963555D48">had not been in &s;ome Degree morally good and plea&s;ing to GOD, the <HI>Judge of all the Earth who will do right</HI> would not have requited it with &s;uch a Reward. Chri&s;t &s;aid to one, <HI>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of GOD.</HI> Now if no unconverted Man has any moral Goodne&s;s at all, then one is not nearer to the Kingdom of GOD than another; all being equally de&s;titute of Goodne&s;s, and in the State of the Devils. It is therefore your Mi&s;take to &s;ay that all the be&s;t Endeavours of every one who hath not yet come up to the Terms of Salvation, have no moral Goodne&s;s in them. For as good Men are not in this Life perfectly good, and free from all moral Evil; &s;o every wicked Man is not perfectly wicked and void of all moral Good|ne&s;s, that is, all wicked Men are not arrant Devils while in this Life. Well, but &s;uppo&s;e, it were granted, that while we come &s;hort of a &s;incere Compliance with the Terms of Salvation, all we do is Sin; yet how does it follow, that we may not de|pend upon it, that if we do the be&s;t we can, GOD will help us to do &s;ome Thing that is not Sin? <HI>Without Faith we cannot plea&s;e GOD:</HI> But how does it follow from thence, that if we &s;trive with all our Strength GOD's Spirit will not help us to a right Faith? Though we &s;hould grant, that while Men remain wicked they do nothing but Sin, yet that is no Proof, that they can not do better; or that GOD is not ready to afford them that gracious A&s;&s;i&s;tance by which they could <HI>cea&s;e to do Evil and learn to do well.</HI> All GOD's Commands, Calls, and Invitations to Sinners to believe, repent, to turn and live, imply that GOD will afford them &s;ufficient Grace to do what he requires. For his Commands are Indications of his Will. And GOD cannot will that which is impo&s;&s;ible: It being a Weakne&s;s that the Almighty cannot be &s;ubject to. And he who commands what he knows is impo&s;&s;ible, does not de&s;ire or intend to be obeyed, And who dare &s;ay, that when GOD by the Go&s;pel <HI>commands all Men every where to repent;</HI> that he does not will, or de&s;ire, or intend to be obeyed? And if he does de&s;ire to be obeyed, then he leaves none under an Impo&s;&s;ibility to believe, and obey the Go&s;pel. And when GOD commands us to believe in Chri&s;t, it not only denotes, that we &s;hould do &s;o, but that we can believe. As when Chri&s;t commanded a dead Man to ari&s;e, and &s;aid, <HI>Lazarus come forth;</HI> he at the &s;ame Time enabled him to obey, and come forth; orherwi&s;e he would not have laid &s;uch a Command upon him; or given &s;uch a Call. So when he commanded the Man who had a withered Hand, to
<PB N="14" REF="006093_0012_102783FFD3B787F8">&s;tretch it out, it was equivalent to a Promi&s;e, that he &s;hould be able to do &s;o, provided he would try to obey. So GOD never commands Men to repent, and come to Chri&s;t, but he likewi&s;e puts it in their Power to do it. The Spirit accom|panies the Word, till Men by their ob&s;tinacy have quenched it. And to &s;ay, that GOD commands Men to believe and repent and yet don't enable them to obey him, is to charge GOD with Folly and Cruelty. Folly, in that it &s;uppo&s;es GOD Wills and de&s;ires Impo&s;&s;ibilities: and Cruelty, in that it &s;uppo&s;es he requires that Service, which he gives no Strength to perform; like a Ma&s;ter who requires Work to be done by his Servant, but will afford him neither Maintenance nor Tools.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, all bapti&s;ed Per&s;ons have a Covenant-Right to all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Gho&s;t that is nece&s;&s;ary in order to their obtaining Salvation. As Bapti&s;m is a Seal of the Covenant between the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity and us; &s;o when we are bapti&s;ed into the Name of the Holy Gho&s;t, he engages to be our Sanc|tifier, i. e. to do all that is nece&s;&s;ary on his Part for our Sanc|tification. If you deny that by Bapti&s;m we have a Covenant-Right to &s;ufficient Grace to &s;anctify us, you thereby declare, that Bapti&s;m is an in&s;ignificant Ceremony, a Sign without any Thing &s;ignified, a Seal without any Thing &s;ealed or engaged on the Part of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>If you &s;ay, tho' God does give us Power to believe and re|pent, yet he does not give it as a Reward for any <HI>Strivings, Endeavours, or Doings of ears, while we are unregenerate.</HI> I reply, no Body imagines that he does &s;o. We grant, that the Grace of GOD prevents us. GOD begins with us; not we with him. The Spirit moves us before ever we move in Re|ligion. The fir&s;t Grace is be&s;towed upon us before ever we a&s;k, &s;eek, or knock. If GOD &s;hould not give us Grace be|fore we did &s;omething plea&s;ing to him, or &s;ome morally good Action, to qualify us for Grace, or to merit Grace in the lowe&s;t Sen&s;e; we never &s;hould receive any Grace at all. And there|fore your citing Texts, and Bi&s;hop <HI>Hopkins,</HI> to prove this Point, was perfectly needle&s;s: And the Boa&s;ting you mention about an Hundred Times, we readily acknowledge is excluded by Grace. And no Man can truly &s;ay, I &s;ought GOD be|fore I had his Grace, and by my own Endeavours I gain'd a Right to the fir&s;t Grace. This is &s;o obvious a Truth, &s;o con&s;tantly inculcated in our Liturgy as well as in the Holy Bible, that I never knew any Profe&s;&s;or of the Church of <HI>England</HI> doubt
<PB N="15" REF="006093_0013_10278404679C9060">of it, and the Doctor him&s;elf a&s;&s;erts and inculcates it. For you therefore to repre&s;ent it as tho' this was the Point in Conte&s;t, if it be not Slandering, yet it mu&s;t be accounted an inexcu&s;able Blunder.</P>
<P>Another Thing I would ob&s;erve, you in&s;i&s;t upon is, that it is very <HI>wrong to pray for converting Grace under the Notion of its being a promi&s;ed Favour.</HI> But in this I mu&s;t differ from you, and can't help thinking, that to pray for it under the Notion of a promi&s;ed Mercy is the only right Method. For when we a&s;k for converting Grace we &s;hould pray for it <HI>with full A&s;&s;u|rance of Faith</HI> as knowing that what we a&s;k for is agreeable to the Will of GOD, becau&s;e as the Apo&s;tle tells us <HI>this is the Will of GOD even our Sanctification.</HI> But it is a &s;inful Pre&s;umption to a&s;k ab&s;olutely for any Thing which GOD has not promi&s;ed. And we mu&s;t pray for nothing but what we can a&s;k in Faith. <HI>For what&s;oever is not of Faith is Sin:</HI> and St. <HI>James</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Let him a&s;k in Faith nothing wavering, James</HI> i. 6. Now where there is no divine Promi&s;e, there can be no divine Faith. GOD's Word and Promi&s;e is the only &s;olid Foundation of Faith and Hope. So that if there were no other Argument again&s;t your Hypothe&s;is, yet this alone is &s;ufficient to overthrow it.</P>
<P>I'll now take Notice of the ill Con&s;equences which you ima|gine, flow from our Doctrine, which is that GOD affords all Men &s;ufficient Grace to become good Men. <HI>This,</HI> &s;ay you, <HI>is likely is bear down and keep under the Sinner's ri&s;ing Fears from Time to Time, to &s;ooth and hu&s;h his accu&s;ing Con&s;cience, and while in Heart really pur&s;uing the World as his chief Good, yet to flatter him with the Hopes of his finally obtaining Heaven too; as having the Grace of GOD well &s;ecured to him by a conditional Promi&s;e, and brought hereby as it were within the Command of his own Endeavours and Improvements.</HI> &mdash; And this you call a <HI>Self-plea&s;ing Opinion,</HI> P. 62. To which I reply; If by the <HI>Grace of GOD's being brought as it were within the Command of our Endeavours and Improvements,</HI> you mean, that as we improve or neglect the Grace of GOD, &s;o it is either increa&s;ed, or with|drawn from us, this is a mo&s;t evident Truth. When Men <HI>re|ceive the Grace of GOD in vain, when they grieve and quench the Spirit and re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> (as the Scripture expre&s;&s;es it) GOD's <HI>Spirit will not always &s;trive with them;</HI> but will withdraw his Influences, and leave them to Hardne&s;s of Heart. But on the other Hand, when Men concur with the ble&s;&s;ed In|fluences
<PB N="16" REF="006093_0014_10278405E97FEAA8">of the Spirit <HI>he gives more Grace,</HI> James iv. 6. When they cheri&s;h the kind Motions of Grace, this ble&s;&s;ed Gue&s;t pays their Souls more frequent Vi&s;its, and operates more power|fully upon them, till <HI>they are changed into the Image of the Lord, from Glory to Glory, by the Spirit of the Lord,</HI> 2 Cor. iii. 18.</P>
<P>But now, how this Scripture-Doctrine &s;hould be likely to in|courage Sinners to delay Repentance, as you &s;ay, is pa&s;t my Comprehen&s;ion. We teach, that the longer a Sinner delays his Repentance, the le&s;s Rea&s;on there is to hope, that he will ever repent; for the more the Spirit will be grieved, and he <HI>hardened through the Deceitfulne&s;s of Sin;</HI> and after a while the ble&s;&s;ed Comforter may finally abandon him, &s;o that he &s;hall never have any Inclination to repent. And tho' this &s;hould not happen to be his Ca&s;e, yet he is &s;ure of no Opportunity but the pre&s;ent to repent in; becau&s;e Life is uncertain, and <HI>we know not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> So that the delay|ing Sinner may die before the Sea&s;on comes, in which he pur|po&s;ed to repent, and then he is lo&s;t forever. So that he who repents not to Day has no <HI>Command</HI> of either Grace or Op|portunity to repent to Morrow. Where then lies the Danger of our Doctrine's <HI>&s;oothing and hu&s;hing Sinners Con&s;ciences in De|laying Repentance?</HI> But your Doctrine has a real Tendency to this. For according to you Men mu&s;t delay their Repentance whether they will, or no, till GOD's Time comes to give them Repentance; which indeed may never come. For you teach, that Conver&s;ion is the Work of GOD alone, an Effect of Al|mighty Power, as much as rai&s;ing the Dead; and therefore does not depend upon any Thing we can do, any more than our Re&s;urrection when we are Dead. And as all dead Men mu&s;t re&s;t in their Graves, till GOD's Time to rai&s;e them comes, &s;o mu&s;t the wicked patiently wait till GOD &s;ees fit to convert them. And if they Strive to be converted, yet all their Strivings, Endeavours, and Doings are nothing but &s;in|ning, offending GOD and making bad wor&s;e. So that if it were po&s;&s;ible for me to believe your Doctrine, and at the &s;ame Time to have one Spark of Rea&s;on remain in me, it would effect|tually <HI>hu&s;h and &s;ooth my Con&s;cience in delaying my Repentance,</HI> till &s;pecial Grace was granted, and that being irre&s;i&s;tible tho' it came but at the la&s;t Breath of a mo&s;t wicked Life yet would it &s;ecure my Admi&s;&s;ion into Heaven; and my antecedent Strivings would not ha&s;ten my Conver&s;ion one Moment, nor my Carele&s;ne&s;s and Lazine&s;s in the lea&s;t Degree retard it&mdash;
<PB N="17" REF="006093_0015_1027840789DEA068">Now let common Sen&s;e determine which of the&s;e Hypothe&s;is does mo&s;t encourage Sinners to delay Repentance.</P>
<P>You tell us, that ours is a <HI>&s;elf plea&s;ing Opinion.</HI> And I heartily agree with you: For it is agreeable to the moral Sen&s;e of all Mankind, and their natural Notions of the Deity; but your's is an Affront to common Rea&s;on, repugnant to the na|tural Notions which Mankind have of GOD, and is contra|dicted by every Man's Experience, who feels, and is con&s;ci|ous to him&s;elf that GOD gives him Power to refu&s;e the Evil, and Chu&s;e the Good. And the Mind mu&s;t be &s;trangely de|bauch'd before it can receive your Scheme without great Strug|glings and Reluctance: Tho' Education and Cu&s;tom will make any Thing ea&s;y, however abhorrent to Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Another evil Fruit of our Doctrine in your Opinion is, that it <HI>cheri&s;hes Pride</HI> and <HI>&s;inful Boa&s;ting,</HI> whereas yours is <HI>a Soul-humbling Doctrine.</HI> But wherein I be&s;eech you lies the Pride and Arrogance of &s;aying as we do, I am not &s;ufficient of my&s;elf &s;o much as to think one good Tho't, but yet I have &s;o honourable an Opinion of GOD's Mercy, that I make no Doubt but that his Grace will be &s;ufficient for me, &s;o that I can do what he commands me to his Acceptance, and if I fail of Salvation, it will not be thro' any Defect of GOD's Grace towards me, but it will be purely owing to my not doing what he would have enabled me to do? Was it Pride in St. <HI>Paul</HI> to &s;ay, <HI>I can do all Things thro' Chri&s;t &s;trengthening me?</HI> Is it Arrogance to &s;ay, I am under no Nece&s;&s;ity to be wicked, for <HI>GOD don't &s;uffer me to be tempted above what I am able?</HI> It appears to me, a much more humbling Thought, when I have done wickedly in any In&s;tance, to reflect that it was not for Want of divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but for want of u&s;ing it, that I am now plunged in Guilt. And if I had done my be&s;t Endeavour I might have been a Child of GOD; whereas now I am a Child of the Devil. This, I &s;ay, is a more aba|&s;ing Reflection than to &s;ay according to your Scheme, I am wicked becau&s;e GOD never put it in my Power to be any other than wicked; nor to do one morally good Deed: the &s;overeign Will of GOD, and <HI>Adam's</HI> fir&s;t Sin is the nece&s;&s;i|tating Cau&s;e of all my Sin. Which is the mo&s;t aba&s;ing Doc|trine, that which charges our Impenitency and Wickedne&s;s upon GOD and our fir&s;t Parents: or that which lays it at our own Door? This is a ju&s;t &s;tating of the Que&s;tion, If I can't po&s;|&s;ibly do any Thing but Sin, (as you teach) then I have no more Rea&s;on to be humbled and troubled in Con&s;cience for it,
<PB N="18" REF="006093_0016_102784098A08E8A0">than for any Di&s;temper or natural Blemi&s;h in my Body. If I am born to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>as the Sparks fly upward,</HI> and GOD puts it not in my Power to do otherwi&s;e, I have then no more Rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of my Wickedne&s;s, than that I have a mortal Nature and mu&s;t die. The more Power we have to do well, the more Rea&s;on we have to be a&s;hamed and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with Remor&s;e when we do Evil.&mdash;And I verily believe, no Tenet was ever advanced among Chri&s;tians which has a greater Tendency to cheri&s;h Pride and Arrogance, than your Doctrine of the Saints Per&s;everance; when you tell People, as one of you did in my hearing, that <HI>you may as well <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> GOD, as if a converted Per&s;on's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Salvation.</HI> And as another not far from me, who in his Sermon told them, that if <HI>they were but ever converted, they might commit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Sins they would, and run as far from GOD as they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> but he would bring them back again, and have them in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>
<P>Now as Dr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>He that is once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this Per&s;ua&s;ion that all the Sins which he can po&s;&s;ibly commit, were they as many as have been committed by all Mankind &s;ince the Beginning of the World, are not able to fru&s;trate his Election, or &s;eparate him from the Love and Favour of Almighty GOD, will be too apt to &s;well with phari&s;aical Pride, and de&s;pi&s;e all other Men as Heathens and Publicans, when &s;uch poor Publicans as have their Minds humble and relying on GOD, will &s;tand a-loof, not during to approach too near the divine Maje&s;ty, but crying out with, <HI>GOD be merciful unto me a Sinner.</HI> For this we need produce no Proof, we find it in the &s;upercilious Looks and haughty Car|riage of tho&s;e who are &s;o well a&s;&s;ured of their own Election; who cannot &s;o di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves, as not to undervalue and de&s;pi&s;e all tho&s;e who are not of the &s;ame Party with them: A Race of Men who&s;e In&s;olence and Pride there is no avoiding.</Q> And &s;carce a Pamphlet do they publi&s;h, without boa&s;ting of the Piety of their Party, as if all true Piety was confined to them, and nothing but the Form belonged to us.</P>
<P>Two or three Things more I &s;hall take Notice of, and con|clude. Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI> in the Sermon which you undertook to vin|dicate, in proving that there are no Promi&s;es to the Unregene|rate, advanced this Argument, viz. <HI>If GOD hate bound him&s;elf by his Promi&s;e to his Creatures, he is no more at perfect Liberty either to grant or withhold the promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ing, as may plea&s;e him:</HI> Which Argument carries this Sen&s;e, or none at all to the Pur|po&s;e, and when drawn out into proper Form &s;tands thus:</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="006093_0017_1026E7B616ED85A8"><HI>If GOD has bound him&s;elf by his Promi&s;e to his Creatures, he is no more at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Liberty either to grant or with-hold the pro|mi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ing as may plea&s;e him. But GOD being ab&s;olutely &s;overeign, is at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Liberty either to grant or with-hold his Ble&s;&s;ing as plea&s;eth him;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Therefore God hath not bound him&s;elf to his Creatures by his Promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Now, &s;ays the Doctor, <Q>Surely if this Argument proves any Thing, it proves that no Promi&s;e at all, to good or bad is con&s;i&s;tent with the divine Sovereignty; and then where is there any Place for any New Covenant, or indeed old either? And if the Ca&s;e be &s;o, away with the Bible &s;ure enough.</Q> Which is as ju&s;t a Remark as ever was made, and as well grounded. And yet for this you &s;pend Page after Page in loading the Doctor with your Obloquies and Revilings, charg|ing him with <HI>Untruths, Mi&s;takes, grand Mi&s;takes, Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, Unchri&s;tian Reflections.</HI> Thus foul and abu&s;ive Language &s;up|plies the Place of &s;olid Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>And then <HI>P.</HI> 15. you gravely ask, <HI>If the&s;e Words of Mr.</HI> Cooke's <HI>be not mo&s;t evidently true?</HI> To which I an&s;wer, that as a Cypher &s;tanding alone is no Number, &s;o this Sentence when it &s;tands &s;ingly and by it &s;elf, is true and harmle&s;s, but as it &s;tands in Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Sermon, and is u&s;ed by him as a Medium, or Argument to prove, that there are no Promi&s;es to the Unregenerate, it is a mo&s;t gro&s;s and pernicious Un|truth, and if admitted, as the Doctor ob&s;erves, it will follow, there are no Promi&s;es of GOD to any Creature, becau&s;e they would be incon&s;i&s;tent with that Notion of Sovereignty which he was preaching up. And your not perceiving this mu&s;t certainly be owing to &s;ome Defect either in your Head, or Heart, but in which, GOD, and I believe, your own Con&s;cience knows.</P>
<P>Again, the Doctor had ob&s;erved, <Q>that nothing can &s;o ef|fectually tend to tempt us to entertain hard Thoughts of GOD, and cut the Sinews of all Endeavours to do our Duty as even the mo&s;t di&s;tant Surmize, that po&s;&s;ibly all our Labour may be in vain, &s;ince for ought we know, we may be ab|&s;olutely excluded from all Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucceeding by an in|exorable Decree of Reprobation.</Q> In remarking upon this, you make the be&s;t Show of Rea&s;oning of any Part of your Performance. For, &s;ay you, <HI>Doth not the Hu&s;bandman plow in Hope without the lea&s;t Certainty of Succe&s;s?</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that is becau&s;e the Hu&s;bandman believes nothing of your Doctrine; but whatever idle Speculations of Fate and
<PB N="20" REF="006093_0018_102784129393B030">ab&s;olute Prede&s;tination may &s;wim in his Brain, yet in his hearty and predominant Belief he is an <HI>Arminian.</HI> For did the Hu&s;|bandman heartily believe, that it was ab&s;olutely decreed, that he &s;hould, or &s;hould not have a Crop, and that without Re|gard to his Plowing, as you pretend to believe, that Men are elected, or reprobated without Fore&s;ight of their Faith or Works, and did he believe that Plowing and Sowing were the &s;ole Work of GOD alone, and done by an irre&s;i&s;table Power, as you believe Conver&s;ion is; I care &s;ay, he would neither plow, &s;ow, nor reap, until Experience had taught him a more or|thodox Faith. But Men are not &s;o ea&s;ily cheated with fal&s;e Schemes in their temporal, as in their &s;piritual Concerns; as Chri&s;t has ob&s;erved, <HI>The Children of this World are wi&s;er in their Generation than the Children of Light.</HI> And the Doctor's Ob&s;ervation is very ju&s;t, for what Madne&s;s is it to &s;trive to alter an ab&s;olute Decree of Heaven, in the making of which there was no Regard to what we would or could do in Time?</P>
<P>Let us now hear the Conclu&s;ion of the whole Matter. The Que&s;tion between us is this, <HI>whether there be any Certainty, that a Sinner, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of common Grace, continuing to &s;trive as earn&s;tly and as regularly as he po&s;&s;ibly can, will ever find Mercy at the Hands of GOD?</HI> You hold the Negative, and we the Affirmative. <HI>That Party</HI> (as you &s;ay who) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> right Side of the Que&s;tion, have the true Go&s;pel;</HI> but they <HI>who are in the wrong Side of it, have only a Go&s;pel of Man's De|vi&s;ing.</HI> To which I &s;ay, AMEN.</P>
<P>Your Evidence when &s;ummed up, is this, the be&s;t that an unconverted Sinner can do while &s;uch, has <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> true moral Goodne&s;s in it; therefore it is unrea&s;onable to &s;upo&s;e that GOD &s;hould a&s;certain &s;pecial Grace to the Performance of &s;uch defective and &s;inful Doings. To which we an&s;wer; this is nothing at all to the Purpo&s;e. For tho' it be granted&mdash;that while a Man does not give up him&s;elf &s;incerely and intirely to GOD in Chri&s;t, he does no Duty to GOD's final Accep|tance; yet it does not from thence follow, that he cannot by GOD's preventing Grace &s;o &s;incerely watch and pray and &s;trive as thereby to be &s;o far accepted as to become certainly qua|lified for further and effectually &s;aving Grace. And though <HI>they who are in the Fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e GOD,</HI> yet it does not from thence follow that they cannot by the Help of GOD's Grace come out of that wretched State, and then plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>The grand Sophi&s;m and Fallacy which runs through the whole of your Rea&s;oning is this, Unregenerate Men whil&s;t they
<PB N="21" REF="006093_0019_102784171A1A3C58">remain &s;uch can do nothing in a &s;pecial Sen&s;e plea&s;ing to GOD; therefore you conclude, that they can't by all the divine Grace afforded to them, come out of that State, and become &s;incere Chri&s;tians. Which is a poor begging the Que&s;tion, and prov|ing nothing as to the Point in Conte&s;t. You prove that wicked Men whil&s;t wicked, can do no good Works, whereas you &s;hould prove, that wicked Men mu&s;t remain wicked, and that all the Grace that GOD affords them while they are wicked is in|&s;ufficient to enable them to become &s;incere. And for as much as you have not done this, though you have done much, yet have you done nothing to the Purpo&s;e. In a Word, tho&s;e Points which are in Conte&s;t, as whether Grace be irre&s;i&s;table, whether &s;ufficient Grace be afforded to &s;uch as never repent, whether GOD does all in our Conver&s;ion, the&s;e you take for granted: And a Point about which no Body doubts, you have prov'd mo&s;t laboriou&s;ly: this is the true Character of your Piece.</P>
<P>As to your Di&s;cour&s;e of Original Sin, though I will not &s;ay as the Quaker did to <HI>Whitefield,</HI> that it is <HI>nothing but ori|ginal Non-&s;en&s;e:</HI> yet I am &s;ure, I can't find the Sen&s;e of a great Part of it. But it &s;eems to be &s;ummed up in this Que&s;|tion. <HI>Did GOD's Perfections <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> him to make Provi&s;ion in our Ca&s;e?</HI> P. 73. I &s;uppo&s;e, you mean, was GOD obliged to &s;end his Son into the World to redeem us, upon <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall? I an&s;wer, No. Had it not been for GOD's &s;overeign Good|ne&s;s, his Threatning would have been put into Execution, <HI>In the Day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die:</HI> and then <HI>Adam</HI> would have had no Po&s;terity to &s;uffer for his Sin. Your Di&s;cour&s;e therefore proceeds upon a Mi&s;take, viz. That if GOD had not &s;een fit to &s;hew Mercy to Man after the Fall, yet our fir&s;t Parents would have continued in this World, and have propagated their Kind; and we after Death &s;hould have ri&s;en to an immortal State in another World, i. e. to lie in the Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. Which Notion is not only without Foundation in holy Scripture, but is directly contrary to it. For the Death threatned to <HI>Adam</HI> was as GOD him&s;elf explained it <HI>to return to Du&s;t out of which he was taken,</HI> not to go to Hell.&mdash;Be&s;ides, the Scrip|ture informs us, that had there been no Saviour provided, there would have been no Re&s;urrection. As <HI>by Man came Death, &s;o by Man came the Re&s;urrection.</HI> And Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>I am the Re|&s;urrection and the Life.</HI> So that had not GOD provided a Re|medy upon the Fall, we &s;hould not have been liable to be damned for <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, as the Devils were for their own. Which ob&s;ervation demoli&s;hes your Hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="006093_0020_102784189B6050E8">One thought more I would hint to you, and I have done, which is, that your great Labour in this Affair was perfectly needle&s;s: Becau&s;e you teach the &s;ame Doctrine that you write again&s;t. <Q>You &s;ay, GOD has given great and precious En|couragements for Sinners to Strive, and the more they Strive, the more Rea&s;on the Go&s;pel gives them, to hope for Salvation. Thus you begin: And in your Conlu&s;ion you tell us, it is your full Per&s;ua&s;ion, that in the Day of Judgment, not one &s;ingle Soul will be found, who did his be&s;t Endeavour, and yet mi&s;t of Salvation.</Q> This is exactly our Opinion too. The wor&s;t that we teach in this Affair is, that it is certain by GOD's Word, that no Sinner who does his be&s;t, &s;hall mi&s;s of Salvation, where then is the mighty Differ|ence, which could ju&s;tify you in accu&s;ing us of holding <HI>ano|ther Covenant, another Go&s;pel, of dangerous Errors, Here&s;ies, Pe|lagiani&s;m,</HI> and I know not what; When you your&s;elf pretend to believe ju&s;t the &s;ame Thing?&mdash;If you &s;till in&s;i&s;t upon it, that we do differ widely, becau&s;e we hold, that GOD has given a Promi&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t the weary and heavy laden Sinner in coming to Chri&s;t; while you believe he has only given <HI>great and precious Encouragements to do it,</HI> &s;uch as never did, and ne|ver will fail any who tru&s;t to them; Still I &s;ay, here is no real Difference. For by the&s;e <HI>great Encouragements,</HI> you mu&s;t mean GOD's having called and invited Sinners to accept of his Mercy, and commanded them to turn and live, &amp;c. And it is incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the Sincerity of our heavenly Father, to invite Men to accept of that which he never intends they &s;hall have, or to command them to do, what he is not di&s;po&s;ed to ena|ble them to do. This I &s;ay, mu&s;t be your Meaning. And this is all that we pretend to, &s;o that in &s;pight of all your Endeavours to differ and quarrel, you &s;till agree with us. And is it not unmanly and unchri&s;tian, to contend &s;o fiercely, and clamor &s;o loudly for a Word, and propagate a Spirit of Bitterne&s;s and Uncharitablene&s;s for only a Phra&s;e, when we are agreed in the Sen&s;e? If you &s;ay, who began this &s;illy Fray and Squabble about Words? I an&s;wer you with your Company, who made a Bu&s;ine&s;s thro' the Country to preach to &s;erious People in the greate&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s to plea&s;e GOD, and tell them, though they &s;trove and cried Day and Night for Mercy, yet there was but a <HI>meer Perhaps,</HI> and a meer MAY-BE for them. And when by this Craft you had driven a poor Soul into Di&s;|traction then you boa&s;ted, that you had got the Spirit to work in them; and in&s;ulted over us, becau&s;e we had no &s;uch
<PB N="23" REF="006093_0021_1027841BACFC1530"><HI>Seals of our Mini&s;try</HI> calling us <HI>Arminians, Phari&s;ees,</HI> and <HI>almo&s;t</HI> an infinite Number of reproachful Epithets. And he was ac|counted the mo&s;t excellent Preacher who could hit upon the mo&s;t extravagant and out of the Way Phra&s;e to reproach human Nature and Go&s;pel-Obedience with. I write no Calumny, but Facts to which there are Thou&s;ands of Witne&s;&s;es. And yet if for this you don't call me a <HI>Bla&s;phemer,</HI> you have altered your Language.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding all this Load of Reproaches ca&s;t upon us, yet whenever you are plea&s;ed to di&s;cour&s;e &s;oberly, you make the Difference betwixt us and you, no greater than between <HI>great and precious Encouragements,</HI> which never did or will fail any, and Promi&s;es. And for my Part rather than contend for a Word, I will part with Promi&s;es, for &s;uch <HI>great and precious En|couragements,</HI> if that will content you. For I am &s;ure, that a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Honour, much more a GOD of Mercy and Truth, will no more fail or di&s;appoint a poor Beggar who tru&s;ts to his <HI>great Encouragements,</HI> than if he had had an expre&s;s Promi&s;e. The plain Truth is, that whatever Di&s;tance there is between you and us in this Point, there is the &s;elf-&s;ame Di&s;tance and Di&s;agreement between you, and your&s;elf. And if you ever are &s;o happy as to agree with your&s;elf, at the &s;ame In&s;tant you will agree with us. But I never knew any one on your Side of the Que&s;tion, who did not pull down with one Hand, what he had built up with the other. This I confe&s;s is not peculiar to you, for I have heard that late eminent Writer Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> on your Side, affirm both in his Preaching and in private Conver&s;ation, That <HI>there is a Promi&s;e, or at lea&s;t equivalent to a Promi&s;e, that they who improve common Grace &s;hall have &s;pecial Grace.</HI> That the&s;e were his Words I can freely make Oath. And yet this &s;ame Gentleman has endeavoured to repre&s;ent me as an Heretick, a Contradicter of Scripture, and all the Prote&s;tant Churches on Earth, for the &s;ame Doctrine&punc; But however you di&s;a|gree among your &s;elves, and even the &s;ame Man is at Variance with him&s;elf; and all the while &s;ure to be in the Right, yet there is one Thing you are all agreed in, and con&s;tant to, that is, to contradict, and reproach the Church of <HI>England:</HI> &s;o <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> and <HI>Herod,</HI> though at Enmity between them&s;elves, yet both agreed to &s;et our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour at Nought.</P>
<P>Thus Sir, I have told you my Opinion of your Performance uprightly, and I think, without Reviling on the one Hand, or Flattery on the other. Treat me in the &s;ame frank and candid Manner; and it will be very agreeable to, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your old Friend and humble Servant.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
