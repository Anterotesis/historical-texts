<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER admits the <HI>moral</HI> Perfections and univer&s;al Providence of <HI>Almighty God,</HI> mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily grant that the Maje&s;ty of his Govern|ment, and the Honor of his Laws, require that &s;ignal Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es &s;hould be &s;ignally corrected When the&s;e Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es are of a private Nature, their full Puni&s;h|ment is often referred to another World; but when the Guilt is public and <HI>national,</HI> the Puni&s;hment of it mu&s;t be <HI>national</HI> al&s;o. For it is only in this World that whole Nations can be puni&s;hed as &s;uch, &s;ince in the World to come, all le&s;&s;er Societies or Combina|tions of Men, that are entred into here, will be for ever di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Both Sacred and Profane Hi&s;tory bears Te&s;timony to the remark|able Judgments that have been poured down upon Guilty Nations. Some have ki&s;&s;ed the Rod of the Almighty, and humbled them|&s;elves before the <HI>Lord their Maker;</HI> and he has <HI>returned and repented, and left a Ble&s;&s;ing behind him.</HI> But others have hardened their Faces, and refu&s;ed all Correction; and have therefore been given up to entire Ruin and De&s;olation. For there is a Time when the Pati|ence of the Almighty has had its full Work, and when the Mea&s;ure of a People's Iniquity is compleat, &s;o that nothing remains but a <HI>fearful looking for Judgment, and fiery Indignation!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007606_0003_102BA7F3E0A75448">
It has been the Practice of the wi&s;e&s;t Nations of all Ages, to &s;et apart particular Times to be kept holy for particular Purpo&s;es. And whoever allows SOCIAL WORSHIP to be a Duty, and the devoting one Day in Seven to adore the <HI>Lord our Maker, publickly and in the great Congregation,</HI> for the common Benefits which we daily receive, and to pray for Forgivene&s;s of the common Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es which we daily commit;&mdash;I &s;ay, whoever allows this to be a Duty, mu&s;t like|wi&s;e allow it to be an indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty for a People to &s;et apart and keep holy particular Times, either of <HI>Thank&s;giving</HI> or <HI>Humiliation,</HI> as often as they receive any particular Deliverance, or are threat|ened with any particular Puni&s;hment or Judgment. And as it is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e who watch over the Welfare of the State to point out and enjoin the Sea&s;ons proper for &s;uch Purpo&s;es; &s;o it is the Duty of every Individual of the Community, to ob&s;erve the &s;ame with all becoming Reverence and Solemnity.</P>
<P>Of this Nature was the <HI>general</HI> FAST appointed to be kept holy by all his Maje&s;ty's loving Subjects in this Province and three <HI>Lower Counties,</HI> on the 21&s;t of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, being the &s;ame Day on which a like Fa&s;t was appointed in one of the Neighbouring Pro|vinces. Certainly, if ever any People had a more immediate Call to humble them&s;elves before the LORD JEHOVAH, it was our Duty &s;o to do, upon that &s;olemn Occa&s;ion; when our joint Thank&s;gi|vings were to be offered up at the <HI>Foot&s;tool of Omnipotence,</HI> for a mo&s;t remarkable Deliverance from wide-&s;preading Earthquakes, which had laid &s;everal Cities level with the Du&s;t; and when all that is dear and valuable to us, as <HI>Britons</HI> and as <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> was to be the Subject of our united Prayers and Supplications. To be convinced of this we need only to read the GOVERNOR's excellent Procla|mation, which is delivered in a Stile &s;o truly pathetic, affecting and &s;olemn, that one would imagine it might have rou&s;ed the mo&s;t Hardened, and overcome the mo&s;t Ob&s;tinate. In the Preamble it &s;ets forth the Rea&s;ons of the &s;aid FAST, as follows;</P>
<P><Q>THAT it is often the Method of God's Providence, for the Glory of his Name, and the Maintenance of true Holine&s;s, gra|ciou&s;ly to vi&s;it his People for their Sins, and in a more &s;olemn
<PB N="5" REF="007606_0004_102BA7F56E7923F8">
Manner to call them to Repentance by awakening Judgments from Heaven, which, if neglected or contemned, render &s;uch a People &s;till more obnoxious to the divine Di&s;plea&s;ure:&mdash;That at this pre&s;ent Time, the Judgments of the Lord &s;eem vi&s;ibly to be abroad upon the Earth, who&s;e habitable Parts have been almo&s;t univer&s;ally agitated with frequent and mo&s;t dreadful <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> great Cities in divers Places being overturned to their Foundations, many Thou&s;ands of their Inhabitants whelmed in the Ruins, and Wars, and Rumours of Wars, with Sin and Wickedne&s;s, neverthele&s;s exten&s;ively prevailing:&mdash;That our gracious Sovereign on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne, touched with a deep Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things, and a thorough Concern for the Glory of God, and the Pro&s;perity of his Dominions, was plea&s;ed to appoint and com|mand a Day of public <HI>Fa&s;ting, Prayer</HI> and <HI>Supplication,</HI> and to hallow that Day by his royal Example, ri&s;ing from the Throne like the King of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> and humbling him&s;elf in the Du&s;t, together with his good Subjects, in one grand and &s;olemn Act of Devotion before the <HI>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,</HI> mo&s;t fervently imploring the adorable Maje&s;ty of Heaven <HI>to avert ju&s;t Judgments from us, to continue his Mercies towards us, to perpetuate the Enjoyment of the Prote&s;tant Religion, and to protect and ble&s;s our Fleets and Armies:</HI>&mdash;That the Imitation of &s;uch an illu&s;trious Pattern of <HI>Humiliation</HI> and <HI>Devotion,</HI> was not only our indi&s;pen|&s;ible Duty, on &s;o awful and intere&s;ting an Occa&s;ion; as we are Subjects to the be&s;t of Kings, and equally concern'd with o|thers of his faithful Subjects in the general Safety and Pro&s;perity of his Dominions, but e&s;pecially as the Province which we inha|bit is at this Time particularly vi&s;ited with the murdering Sword of a &s;avage Enemy, a con&s;iderable Part of it being already laid wa&s;te by their bloody Ravages; great Numbers of our unhappy Fellow-Subjects cruelly murdered, or carried into barbarous Captivity, and the en&s;uing Summer opening a Pro&s;pect that &s;eems big with the Fate of the&s;e Colonies, and more nearly intere&s;ting their &s;u|ture Safety than any Period which they have ever yet beheld.</Q></P>
<P>Nor were the Ends propo&s;ed by this FAST le&s;s affecting than the awful Occa&s;ion of it. For the Proclamation goes on to declare
<PB N="6" REF="007606_0005_102BA7F7DC89F820">
that it was de&s;igned for a Day <Q>Of general <HI>Humiliation</HI> before the Lord our God, that we might with one Heart and Voice, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and devout Manner, &s;end up our united Prayers and Supplications to the Throne of Grace and Mercy, through the un&s;peakable Merits and Interce&s;&s;ion of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>for the Forgivene&s;s both of our private and nati|onal Sins; for averting the Puni&s;hments ju&s;tly due to them; for Refor|mation and Amendment of Manners; for Harmony and public Spirit in all our Tran&s;actions; for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon his Maje&s;ty's Arms employed in the Defence of our ju&s;t Rights both by Sea and Land; for Con&s;olation and Redre&s;s to our &s;uffering Brethren and Neighbours; for a &s;peedy de|liverance from our cruel and blood-thir&s;ty Enemies; and for continuing among us, and &s;preading abroad to the remote&s;t Parts of this dark Conti|nent, the ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ings of</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Liberty, and the pure Light of the Prote&s;tant Religion, as it is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, equally reformed from vain Super&s;tition and giddy Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e were the great Ends of this Fa&s;t; and certainly none were ever more becoming a Government to enjoin, or a People to comply with. For there is &s;carce a &s;ingle Thing worthy of our Care in this Life, <HI>as a Society of dependent Creatures,</HI> which is not comprized under &s;ome one of the foregoing Heads.&mdash;And, On! what a glorious Pro&s;pect it would have been, to have beheld two or three Provinces, without one di&s;&s;enting Voice, humbling them|&s;elves before a <HI>Heart-&s;earching God</HI> for &s;uch important Purpo&s;es, and throwing them&s;elves at the <HI>precious</HI> REDEEMER'S <HI>Feet</HI> for Mercy and Favor. One may &s;afely affirm, that there is not, among <HI>all the Works of the Almighty,</HI> a Pro&s;pect that would have been more plea&s;ing to him than &s;uch an Appearance of his repenting and re|turning Creatures But alas! the Harmony of the fine&s;t In&s;tru|ment may be interrupted and marred by one peevi&s;h and jarring String! In order to have given &s;uch an Appearance its full Beau|ty and Lu&s;tre, it ought to have been univer&s;al, and without Ex|ception; for as every Member of the Community has added to the general Guilt, &s;o every Member ought likewi&s;e to have joined in the general Humiliation. And for any Sett of Men to oppo&s;e their &s;tubborn Wills to the Sen&s;e of a Community, and to do all
<PB N="7" REF="007606_0006_102BA7FACC240070">
in their Power to prevent that general-Ble&s;&s;ing which the <HI>Lord</HI> has promi&s;ed to &s;uch a general Act of Devotion, thereby involving o|thers in the fatal Effects of their Ob&s;tinacy;&mdash;I &s;ay, for any Sett of Men to act thus, is a Degree of Ba&s;ene&s;s for which I have no Name. Good Men have Rea&s;on to think it their Misfortune to be connected in the &s;ame Society with &s;uch perver&s;e Per&s;ons, and heartily to mourn becau&s;e they are con&s;trained to <HI>&s;ojourn in Me&s;ech, and to dwell in the Tents of Kedar!</HI></P>
<P>Such was the Perver&s;ene&s;s of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> on the late <HI>&s;olemn Fa&s;t.</HI> And Notwith&s;tanding all the afore&s;aid Con&s;ide|rations, and the expre&s;s Order of the Government,&mdash;<Q>re|quiring the &s;aid Fa&s;t to be religiou&s;ly kept by all his Maje&s;ty's loving Subjects within this Province and Counties, of what&s;oe|ver Denomination, as they tendered their own temporal and eter|nal Welfare, and would not be deemed wanting in the <HI>univer|&s;al Duties</HI> of GRATITUDE to their <HI>adorable Maker,</HI> AFFECTION for their <HI>gracious Sovereign,</HI> COMPASSION for their &s;uffering Bre|thren, and <HI>Regard</HI> for their own IMMEDIATE SAFETY;</Q> yet mo&s;t of them in this City, as well as in the Country, refu&s;ed to pay the lea&s;t Regard to the Day, but were rather more bu&s;y than u&s;ual in pur&s;uing their temporal Callings, and gra&s;ping at the vile Dro&s;s of this World!</P>
<P>Early on the Morning of the &s;aid Day, the MAYOR of this City being informed, that many of the &s;aid <HI>Quakers,</HI> neither re&s;train|ed by Decency to their Neighbours, nor moved by the calamitous Situation of their Country, were ob&s;tinately employed in &s;ervile Labor, &s;ent the following Warrant directed to the Con&s;tables of the City, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>In Con&s;equence of this Warrant the Con&s;tables returned the Names of 61 Heads of Families, all <HI>Quakers</HI> in this City who were found employed in Oppo&s;ition to this Order of Government. Their Power and Numbers will no Doubt &s;creen them from the Puni&s;hment which might ju&s;tly be inflicted upon &s;uch Ob&s;tinacy and Contempt. But they &s;hall not e&s;cape that Cen&s;ure which the <HI>PRESS,</HI> and EVERY GOOD MAN ought to pronounce again&s;t them. It was once intended to add the Names of the Offenders in this Place, that the Innocent might not &s;uffer with the Guilty; for it is but Ju&s;tice to confe&s;s, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t rational and &s;en&s;ible <HI>Quakers</HI> of this City were not among the Number, and who, if they did not go to any Place of Wor&s;hip, yet thought it their Duty not to give any Offence to their Fellow-Citizens, and kept their Hou&s;es &s;hut up accordingly. But the&s;e were only a few in Compari&s;on to the Number of Offenders. Neverthele&s;s, as they are &s;ufficiently known, I &s;hall &s;pare filling up my Paper with their Names; and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that among the re&s;t were three Members of the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly re&s;iding in this City, who were the Foremo&s;t to follow their worldly Callings, and to refu&s;e joining in public Prayers to <HI>Almighty God</HI> for the Pre&s;ervation of that HOLY PROTESTANT RELIGION AND CIVIL LIBERTY, whereof they are the <HI>pretended</HI> CONSERVATORS.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pa&s;s that Cen&s;ure on the&s;e People which they de&s;erve. I con&s;ign them over to the Public, and to the Cen&s;ure contained in
<PB N="9" REF="007606_0008_102BA7FE71FDF940">
the following <HI>Monitor,</HI> publi&s;hed again&s;t the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> for not ob&s;erving the late Fa&s;t appointed by his Maje&s;ty in that Place. As it comes from a Writer of the highe&s;t Reputation, and mo&s;t approved Abilities, it will be far &s;uperior to any Thing I could &s;ay on the Subject; and therefore I &s;hall conclude my Part of this Publication with a few <HI>Queries</HI> to <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Whether they believe in the ab&s;olute Perfections and wi&s;e Providence of the &s;upreme God?</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether they believe He makes no Di&s;tinction between Vir|tue and Vice, Obedience and Di&s;obedience to his holy Laws?</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether every Member of this Community, <HI>Quakers</HI> as well as others, have not <HI>&s;inned,</HI> and in many Ca&s;es come &s;hort of the Duty which they owe to &s;uch an <HI>adorable Being?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Whether when the Offence is <HI>publick and national,</HI> our Re|pentance and Humiliation ought not to be <HI>public and national al&s;o?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5 Whether, when a particular Sea&s;on is appointed for &s;uch Pur|po&s;es, and a great Majority come chearfully and readily to humble them&s;elves at their <HI>Maker's Feet,</HI> a few have any Right to oppo&s;e them&s;elves to the Sen&s;e of &s;aid Majority, to di&s;turb them in &s;uch a &s;olemn and nece&s;&s;ary Act of Devotion, and thereby to prevent, as far as they can, the obtaining of tho&s;e public Ble&s;&s;ings, which the Lord has graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed to public Repentance and Reforma|tion?</P>
<P N="6">6. Whether Per&s;ons who act thus are not to be con&s;idered as E|nemies to their Country, and to tho&s;e invaluable Enjoyments which we are called, to <HI>pray</HI> for the Pre&s;ervation of, upon &s;uch &s;olemn Oc|ca&s;ions?</P>
<P N="7">7. Whether the <HI>Quakers</HI> were not more immediately concerned than others to pray for the Relief of our bleeding and &s;uffering Country, from that Di&s;tre&s;s and Confu&s;ion, wherein their particular Ob&s;tinacy and ab&s;urd Principles of Government have involved us?</P>
<P N="8">8. Whether Men who thus de&s;pi&s;e every Ordinance of the <HI>Powers that be,</HI> and &s;eem unconcerned at the Sufferings of their Fellow-Ci|tizens, as well as the Vi&s;itations of their ALMIGHTY CREATOR, are fit to receive any civil Tru&s;t, either as Magi&s;trates, or as our Repre|&s;entatives, and Guardians of that <HI>Liberty</HI> and holy Religion which they refu&s;e to join in imploring the <HI>Supreme Being</HI> for the Continu|ance of?</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="10" REF="007606_0009_102BA801CDFB7F90">
9. Whether they have not incurred the highe&s;t Di&s;grace by their late Admini&s;tration of this Province?</P>
<P N="10">10. Whether their Conduct has not been &s;o obnoxious to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, that they were lately deemed by his Maje&s;ty and his Mini&s;ters to have forfeited all Right to civil Offices, as maintain|ing Principles diametrically oppo&s;ite to the Nature of an <HI>Engli&s;h Government,</HI> and to the <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Honor</HI> of his Maje&s;ty's <HI>Crown?</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Whether the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> in Order to prevent the extending of a Te&s;t <HI>for the total Exclu&s;ion of their Friends here from all Places of public Tru&s;t,</HI> have not engaged as it were <HI>Body for Body, that their &s;aid Friends the Quakers of this Province will for the future de|cline meddling in public Matters, and behave more</HI> dutifully <HI>to their So|vereign,</HI> that his ju&s;t Rights may be recovered, and Peace and Happine&s;s &s;ecured for his good Subjects in the&s;e Colonies?</P>
<P N="12">12. Whether the ob&s;tinate Refu&s;al of the <HI>Quakers here</HI> to keep the <HI>late Fa&s;t,</HI> was con&s;i&s;tent with this Duty to their Sovereign, and the Promi&s;e &s;o lately made for them by their Friends in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Whether giving out in Mr. <HI>Bradford's</HI> Journal, No. 703. that only a Majority of <HI>Quakers</HI> have engaged to re&s;ign for a little Time, and that they are to <HI>re&s;ume</HI> their Seats when the pre&s;ent Trou|bles are over, is not a plain Proof that they intend to evade the Promi&s;e made for them, and to continue in their Ob&s;tinacy till they incur a &s;everer Cen&s;ure?</P>
<P N="14">14. Whether it is not the highe&s;t In&s;olence in them to talk of &s;uf|fering other Denominations to come into the A&s;&s;embly to extricate the Province from the Di&s;tre&s;s into which <HI>Quakers</HI> have involved it, and that when the Storm is over, the &s;aid <HI>Quakers</HI> will re&s;ume the Helm, and &s;end tho&s;e others about their Bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P N="15">15. Whether any Per&s;ons of Spirit or Reputation would &s;erve in A&s;&s;embly upon &s;uch di&s;honorable Terms?

<P N="16">16. Whether all the&s;e Things put together do not prove that a <HI>Quaker</HI> will be continually the &s;ame perver&s;e, &s;elf-will'd, deceitful Thing that is &s;o well de&s;cribed in the following MONITOR?</P>

<P>THE &s;ubject of the following paper, tho' I cannot rank it entire|ly among the political, is of &s;o intere&s;ting a nature, in regard to the welfare of the &s;tate, that I doubt not of your acceptance and readine&s;s to communicate the &s;ame to whom it may concern.</P>
<P>THE awful end intere&s;ting occa&s;ion of the late general fa&s;t, which our gracious &s;overeign commanded to be ob&s;erved RELIGIOUSLY by ALL his loving &s;ubjects, was enforced under the&s;e mo&s;t &s;olemn and awakening conditions: <HI>As they tender'd the favour of Almighty</HI> GOD, <HI>and upon pain of &s;uffering</HI> temporal <HI>puni&s;hment,</HI> &s;hould they be found &s;o irreligious and refractory as to <HI>contemn</HI> or <HI>neglect the performance of &s;o religious and nece&s;&s;ary a duty.</HI> A fa&s;t, as his maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf, not only to adore the Almighty for being <HI>our defence in time of danger,</HI> and for having <HI>protected and pre&s;erved us from imminent de&s;tructi|on</HI> of EARTHQUAKES; but al&s;o to implore the divine ble&s;&s;ing and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of PUBLIC AFFAIRS; who&s;e <HI>i&s;&s;ue</HI> is of <HI>the highe&s;t importance to the peace and &s;afety of the&s;e kingdoms, to our com|merce and liberties,</HI> and, above all, to the mo&s;t valuable ble&s;&s;ing of the <HI>Prote&s;tant religion:</HI> I &s;ay this awful and intere&s;ting occa&s;ion, en|forced in &s;o pathetic and powerful a manner from the throne, per&s;ua|ded me that the <HI>fa&s;t</HI> of <HI>Nineveh</HI> would be renewed in the <HI>Briti&s;h Capital.</HI></P>
<P>IT was great &s;atisfaction to every religious heart, and no le&s;s plea|&s;ing to tho&s;e, who pay a ju&s;t regard to the powers in being, and &s;incerely de&s;ire the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and of the Prote&s;tant religion, to &s;ee this Fa&s;t ob&s;erved with that &s;olemn and Chri&s;tian deprotment in all our churches; as the cau&s;e thereof required. Where maje&s;ty appeared arrayed with the brighte&s;t lu&s;tre before the King of Kings: and both hou&s;es of parliament never &s;hone more illu&s;trious, than, at thus &s;olemnity, before the altar. No age, nor condition; no party, nor Religion pretended to be exempt from this univer&s;al obligation.

The <HI>Papi&s;ts, Di&s;&s;enters</HI> of all Denominations, the <HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> and even the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;olemnized the day with acts of humiliation and works of <HI>mercy.</HI></P>
<P>The courts of judicature were &s;ilent: no cau&s;e was that day plead|ed but the national Protection before the Lord. The public offices, the cu&s;toms, the exci&s;e, the exchange, and the very exchequer were not open: the merchants, the manufacturers, the trade&s;men and la|bourers; nay the very common &s;oldiers were impre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their <HI>Chri&s;tian calling</HI> to <HI>obey</HI> the <HI>royal authority,</HI> commanding them <HI>to cea&s;e from all worldly employments, and to exerci&s;e their Chri&s;tian pofe&s;&s;ion by fa&s;ting and prayer,</HI> that not only <HI>the markets were adjourned, the &s;hops, nay the very &s;tews and brothels were &s;hut up; but in this mo&s;t popu|lous city, I am told, there was no appearance of any worldly traffic, except among&s;t a &s;ett of people, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of</HI> Quakers.</P>
<P>If this be true, <HI>Mr. Monitor!</HI> what idea mu&s;t <HI>foreign nations</HI> con|ceive of a &s;tate that <HI>tolerates</HI> a people, who run <HI>counter</HI> to the greate&s;t examples; and <HI>di&s;obey</HI> the <HI>authority,</HI> by which they are <HI>protected?</HI> what <HI>jealou&s;ies</HI> does it create in our minds to be <HI>connected</HI> with a people that will neither <HI>obey their God,</HI> nor <HI>their king!</HI> had the <HI>Jews</HI> opened their &s;hops, and <HI>frequented</HI> their daily <HI>labor,</HI> would it not have been <HI>interpreted</HI> a <HI>contempt of a Chri&s;tian ordinance?</HI> had the <HI>Pa|pi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Nonjurors</HI> made it <HI>a day of plea&s;ure and entertainment,</HI> would not they have been de&s;ervedly branded with <HI>di&s;affection?</HI> had the <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> neglected this nece&s;&s;ary duty, under a <HI>vain pretence</HI> of a <HI>more perfect way</HI> to appea&s;e the <HI>wrath of God,</HI> and to <HI>intercede for his protection and aid;</HI> would they not have <HI>incurred the cen&s;ure of all well wi&s;hers to our happy e&s;tabli&s;hment both in church and &s;tate?</HI></P>
<P>WHAT then can be urged in defence of the&s;e Quakers, who in contempt of his maje&s;ty's proclamation; in oppo&s;ition to the univer&s;al ab&s;tinance from lucrative and worldly employs, and un|moved at the imminent de&s;truction from which the Almighty has pre&s;erved us, and which our enemies are contriving to bring upon this nation, were the only &s;ubjects that appeared in&s;en&s;ible of the public danger, or not de&s;irous of the public good?</P>

weeping and praying, who at the time of public calamities, and general mourning, are taken up in their daily practices of acquiring the riches of this world only? and it is very near boarding upon rebellion, not to comply with &s;uch regulations of a government, as are calculated for God's glory and the public &s;afety.</P>
<P>There can be no great expectation of loyalty and religion from a people, who are deaf to the voice of their &s;overeign; and prefer the advantages of this world, and their peculiar humour or inven|tions, to the intere&s;t we ought to &s;eek in God by fa&s;ting and pray|er; and to the example of the great, the learned, and the devout.</P>
<P>What could an earthly prince &s;ay more to engage all his &s;ub|jects to accompany him to the foot&s;tool of the Almighty, than to declare that the rea&s;on of his proclaiming a <HI>general</HI> and <HI>public</HI> fa&s;t, was, that both he and his people, might <HI>humble them&s;elves before Al|mighty God, and in a mo&s;t devout and &s;olemn manner, &s;end up</HI> their <HI>pray|ers and &s;upplications to the divine Maje&s;ty, to avert ju&s;t judgments, to con|tinue his mercies, to perpetuate the enjoyment of the Prote&s;tant religion a|mong us, and &s;afety and pro&s;perity to the&s;e kingdoms and dominions; and to implore his protection and ble&s;&s;ing upon our fleets and armies.</HI> Was there any token of humiliation among&s;t the <HI>Quakers?</HI> where was their devotion? in what manner did they keep the fa&s;t? in&s;tead of pray|ers and &s;upplications to the Divine Maje&s;ty, they were labouring <HI>for the Mammon of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Neither decency towards their neighbours, nor regard for their king; nor yet the terrors of the Lord, which are abroad upon the earth, could work upon their &s;tubborn, unruly, and hardened hearts. Their &s;hop was their Temple! and their gain was their God!</P>
<P>Is it not a &s;hocking circum&s;tance to be connected with a people that are neither to be moved by judgments, nor engaged by mer|cies, to perform acts of devotion, and to pray for the welfare of the &s;ociety, whereunto they belong? can there be any credit given to their future profe&s;&s;ions in favour of the Prote&s;tant religion, who refu&s;ed on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion to pray for its perpetuity among us? does not &s;uch a behaviour countenance the &s;u&s;picion that <HI>Quakeri&s;m</HI> is continued by the &s;ame je&s;uitical policy, with which it was fir&s;t broached in this i&s;land? and that it has not cleared it&s;elf of the bla&s;phemy for which <HI>George Fox,</HI> their patriarch was puni&s;hed?</P>

&s;acrifices every con&s;ideration both human and divine to an un|meaning ob&s;tinacy?</P>
<P>But what can be expected from a people, who, under the plea of being guided by the &s;pirit, reject the two &s;acraments of Chri&s;t's own in&s;titution; and who are, as far as they do &s;o, <HI>unworthy the Name of Chri&s;tians?</HI> who &s;creening their unju&s;tifiable proceedings under the &s;acred name of con&s;cience and toleration, <HI>make u&s;e of liberty as a cloak to cover their impiety and di&s;obedience.</HI> For no one can plead the act of toleration for doctrines, tenets and deeds which tend to the overthrow of religion and the authority of that government, under which he lives. And I can harbour but a very contemptible opinion of them, who&s;e chief pride lies in <HI>an ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in their own inventions, and in oppo&s;ition to all other in&s;titutions both eccle&s;ia&s;tic and civil.</HI></P>
<P>This is very di&s;tant from the real &s;pirit of Chri&s;t and of his di&s;ci|ples; which is <HI>to give Ce&s;ar his due, to obey tho&s;e that are in authority, to &s;ubmit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake, to mourn with them that mourn, to fa&s;t and pray le&s;t we enter into temptation,</HI> and not to confine the <HI>light</HI> as in a dark lanthorn, but to <HI>let it &s;o &s;hine before men, that they may &s;ee our good works, and glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>It is not the place of a <HI>Monitor</HI> to puni&s;h; but to exert all his faculties with a view to deter evil-doers from proceeding in their wickedne&s;s, and to reclaim tho&s;e, who&s;e hearts are not already gi|ven up to a reprobate &s;en&s;e. Therefore, as in the mid&s;t of Judg|ment, it is the Chri&s;tian &s;pirit to &s;hew mercy, where there appears any token of repentance and amendment; I do not per&s;uade you to &s;ound the trumpet of per&s;ecution; a term which the&s;e <HI>Quakers</HI> have made u&s;e of with great &s;ucce&s;s to extort extraordinary privile|ges from the clemency of the &s;tate: but, as a friend to &s;ociety, and an enemy to no per&s;on, I believe that it can be no breach of chri&s;ti|an charity, nor any force upon a Chri&s;tian con&s;cience, to call them to a remembrance of their duty to <HI>fear God,</HI> and to <HI>honour the King;</HI> and to ask them, how they can reconcile their contempt or neglect of the religious ob&s;ervance of the late fa&s;t, with that authority; which in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, for their pre&s;ent and eternal welfare, called upon them, and enjoined it, as they tender the favour of Almighty God; and upon pain of &s;uffering the pu|ni&s;hment, as they de&s;erve, who re&s;i&s;t or contemn the powers, <HI>or|dained</HI>
