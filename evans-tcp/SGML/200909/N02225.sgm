<HEAD>THE FIGHTING SAILOR TURN'D <HI>Peaceable Chri&s;tian,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>In the Year 1646. I being then about 14 Years of Age, was impr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s'd (or forc'd) and carry'd into the Wars in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> where I remained about two Years, in the Time of the Long Parliament; then was carry'd to <HI>London,</HI> and I went into the Wars again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spaniards;</HI> in which I had many Deliverances, too long here too mention; yet they all at that time wrought but little upon me. Then I was turn'd over into the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Frigot; in which Ship, in proce&s;s of Time, it plea&s;ed God to convert me; as will appear in the fol|lowing Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>As I was Boat&s;wain's Mate, I had the Command of about 200 Men in this Ship, and it was my Place, to &s;ee that the Men attended, and were pre&s;ent at the Time of Wor&s;hip; and I was diligent in the Perfor|mance
<PB N="6" REF="002654_0006_0FE5DB4ECFFE1208">
of that Service; and when any re|fu&s;ed to obey my Command, in that re&s;|pect, I endeavour'd by Force to compel them.</P>
<P>Now of the many Deliverances, I &s;hall only hint at three or four that happen'd in that Day, which wrought &s;ome Re|mor&s;e upon me. The afore&s;aid four De|liverances, was at a Place call'd <HI>Sancta Cruze,</HI> in the I&s;land of the <HI>Canaries;</HI> where I had not only tho&s;e four, but many Deli|verances.</P>
<P>News being brought to our General <HI>Blake,</HI> as we lay in <HI>Cales-Bay,</HI> that &s;ixteen Sail of Galeons arriv'd at <HI>Sancta Cruze</HI> from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> we in&s;tantly went out, and in a few Days got thither, and found as it was reported; and &s;everal Ships went in before us, to make Di&s;covery how they lay, and anchoring at &s;ome Di&s;tance, about half Gun-&s;hot from the Ca&s;tle, which was large, and had 40 Guns at lea&s;t, and there was &s;everal Forts and Brea&s;t-Works, of about 8 or 10 Guns each. The Wind blew very right on the Shore, and we coming in, in a later Squadron, went under our Gene|ral's Stern to know where we &s;hould be? and were an&s;wer'd, <HI>Where we could get room.</HI> So we ran in, but could get no room to bring up our Ship; &s;o we went a-&s;tern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our Ships, and the Smoke being &s;omewhat
<PB N="7" REF="002654_0007_0FE5DB4F93E0DE00">
abated, we found our &s;elves to be within half a Cable's Length of the Vice-Admi|ral's Galeon, of about 50 Guns, and 300 Men; and not above a Cable's Length from the Admiral, a Galeon of about 50 or 60 Guns, and having al&s;o about 400 Men, and within half Gun-&s;hot of a large Ca&s;tle, of 40 Guns; and within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of &s;ome Forts and Brea&s;t-Works.</P>
<P>And when we had brought up our Ship, we were about half a Cable's length from the Vice-Admiral, ju&s;t in his Weak, or in the Head of him; then our Captain call'd to me, to make all ready, or get to veer nearer the Galeon: <HI>For I will,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>be on Board the Vice-Admiral.</HI> So we veer'd to be on Board of him, and &s;o fa&s;t as we veer'd towards him, he veer'd from us, until he came about Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of the Shore. Then the Captain call'd to me, to get a Hau&s;er out of the Gun-Room-Port, and clap a Spring on the Cable; when done, we veer'd our Cable, and by ju&s;t cro&s;s his Haw&s;e, about half a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot from him; then we run all the Guns we could on that Side towards him, which were in Number 28 or 30, and all Hands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to it in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>And the &s;econd Broad&s;ide &s;ome of our Shot, as we judged, fell into his Powder-Room
<PB N="8" REF="002654_0008_0FE5DB50EA6FCCD0">
and &s;he blew up, and not one Man e&s;caped, that we could perceive.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Admiral, was going to &s;erve us, as we had &s;erved his Vice-Admi|ral; which we perceiving, ply'd him very clo&s;e, with about 28 or 30 Guns; and the third Broad&s;ide, all his Men leap'd over-board, and in&s;tantly &s;he blew up.</P>
<P>And there was a &s;mall Ca&s;tle on the o|ther Side, which (after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Admi|ral was blown up) we went to work again&s;t its Fort, and in a &s;hort Time made them weary of it.</P>
<P>And as for the Ca&s;tle of 40 Guns, we were got &s;o far into the Bay, that they could not bring upon us above two or three Guns.</P>
<P>But when we went off, they ply'd us clo&s;e with their great Guns, but did us no great Damage.</P>
<P>After this Expedition was over, and that we had blown up the two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ad|mirals, I took the Long-Boat, to go on Board a Galeon, that lay on Shore near to another Ca&s;tle, &s;uppo&s;ing that the Men were not on Board; but there were &s;ome, and they lay clo&s;e on Board, until we came within two or three Ships length of them, and then they ro&s;e up and fir'd &s;everal Guns at us; but being &s;o near their Ship, all their Shot went over us: Which I call the
<PB N="9" REF="002654_0009_0FE5DB535E800F48">
fir&s;t great Deliverance. Then on our Re|turn towards our Ship, they from &s;everal Ca&s;tles and Brea&s;t-Works, fir'd briskly at us with great and &s;mall Shot, which came very near us; notwith&s;tanding we all got &s;afe on Board our own Ship: And this I call the &s;econd great Deliverance.</P>
<P>In a little Time, the Smoke of their Guns being gone, I &s;aw three Galeons on Shore, all on Board one another; one of them a|long the Shore, and one cro&s;s her Haw&s;e, and the other cro&s;s her Stern, about a Mu&s;|quet-&s;hot from our Ship; and there was a Ca&s;tle on one Side of them, and a Brea&s;t-work on the other, with about 50 or 60 Men in it, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, and the Ga|leons lay about half a Cable's Length from the Ca&s;tle, and the &s;ame Di&s;tance from the Brea&s;t-work, and about fifty Yards from the Shore: Then I took the Pinnace, and two Men with me, and was going to &s;et them on Fire; but the Captain &s;aw me, and call'd me back, and &s;ent five Men more with me; and on our &s;etting forward, our Ship fir'd a Gun, and in the Smoke there|of we got on Board the Galeon, and re|ceived no Harm, (the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having left them) and I in&s;tantly &s;et one of them on Fire, which burnt the other two Galeons. And when we could &s;tay no longer, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;on of the Fire, and our Ship's Crew
<PB N="10" REF="002654_0010_0FE5DB55B15C71B0">
not being as formerly, mindful of us, to fire &s;ome Guns, that in the Smoke there|of we might have retir'd back, without being di&s;covered by any from the Brea&s;t-works; but they &s;eeing of us, we were forc'd, by rea&s;on of the Fire, to return pre&s;ently towards our own Ship. The Brea&s;t-work then having full Sight of us, di&s;charg'd a Volley of about 50 or 60 &s;mall Shot, and kill'd two of our Men, and &s;hot a third in the Back; and I &s;at clo&s;e to one that was kill'd, between him and the Shore, and clo&s;e to him that was &s;hot in the Back, and receiv'd no Harm: And this was a third and eminent Delive|rance.</P>
<P>And coming out of the Bay, we came within three or four Ship's Length of the Ca&s;tle that had 40 Guns; and they kept them in Readine&s;s, until we came directly over-again&s;t the Ca&s;tle, then they fir'd, but we were &s;o near, that mo&s;t of the Shot went over, and did us little Harm, only in our Rigging: And I was on the Clue of the Main-tack, getting the Main-tack on Board, and the Shot cut the Bolt-Rope a little above my Head: And this was the fourth Deliverance, and all in &s;ix Hours Time, and never to be forgotten by me; but I de&s;ire to be thankful to God, who
<PB N="11" REF="002654_0011_0FE5DB5713B26778">
from the&s;e and many other Dangers, has apparently delivered me.</P>
<P>And the afore&s;aid 16 Galeons, were very large Ships, from 300 Tons to 1000, and upwards; and the fir&s;t that I burnt, as our Men judged, had a great deal of Silver on Board, being a Ship of about 800 Ton, and the other two richly laden, and about 7 or 800 Ton, and all peri&s;hed together; and all the re&s;t of the &s;ixteen being richly laden, not having Time to get their La|ding out, we being &s;o &s;uddenly upon them, were all burnt and de&s;troyed, together with their Lading. But then I neither was a <HI>Quaker,</HI> nor were any of the Peo|ple &s;o called on Board our Ship; nor ever to my Remembrance, had heard of any called by that name.</P>
<P>Now I &s;hall a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the fir&s;t Ri&s;e of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> in our Ship: There was &s;ome Soldiers put on Board us, and one of them had been at a Meeting in <HI>Scotland,</HI> of the afore&s;aid People; and there was two young Men in the Ship, who had &s;ome Conver&s;e with him, but he was ta|ken away from the Ship in a little time, but the two young Men made little Ap|pearance of any Conviction or Convince|ment, until about &s;ix Months after. The fir&s;t Thing ob&s;ervable was, they refu|&s;ed to hear the Prie&s;t, or put off their
<PB N="12" REF="002654_0012_0FE5DB57D7D11B60">
Hats to the Captain, for which they cal|led them <HI>Quakers:</HI> The&s;e two met often together in Silence, and their &s;o meeting caus'd a &s;erious Enquiry among others, and their Number increa&s;ed, and as they encrea|&s;ed, &s;o Per&s;ecution increa&s;ed again&s;t them; and the Captain was &s;ore troubled and di|&s;turbed at their Increa&s;e, him&s;elf being a <HI>Bapti&s;t Preacher;</HI> the Prie&s;t that officiated in our Ship was cruel and bitter again&s;t them; crying out thus to me, <HI>O Thomas, an hone&s;t Man, and a good Chri&s;tian! Here is a dangerous People on Board,</HI> (that is to &s;ay the <HI>Quakers) a bla&s;phemous People, denying the Ordinances and Word of God.</HI> The which made me as cruel as him&s;elf, and I gave them many a heavy Blow, and I was vio|lent upon them, and a great Per&s;ecutor of them; but the Remembrance of the afore|&s;aid Deliverances &s;truck clo&s;e to me, and the Lord wrought &s;o much upon me, that I could no more beat any of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and in a little Time the Lord gave me a true Sight of the Prie&s;t; for when I could not do his Work, and beat and abu&s;e the &s;aid People, then I was accounted neither an <HI>hone&s;t Man,</HI> nor <HI>good Chri&s;tian</HI> by him; &s;o I began to look upon the &s;aid People with a &s;ingle Eye, for good. And the Lord by his in-&s;hining Light, open'd my Under&s;tanding, &s;o that
<PB N="13" REF="002654_0013_0FE5DB848533B210">
I &s;aw a great deal of Difference between them, and other Profe&s;&s;ors; whereupon I made many Promi&s;es unto the Lord, to be better; but they being made in my own Will, were of little Effect: Then the Lord &s;hewed me, that in tho&s;e many Promi&s;es, and not keeping them, I was not benefit|ted thereby, and that cau&s;ed much Trou|ble to me; &s;o that I &s;eparated from all &s;orts of Profe&s;&s;ors, except one <HI>Roger Den|nis,</HI> who was called a <HI>Quaker,</HI> whom I in|tirely loved; and in all my Cruelty exer|ci&s;ed upon, and again&s;t the &s;aid People, I never &s;truck him: For he had a Check upon me, tho' he &s;pake not a Word; and many Times when I had re&s;olv'd to &s;eparate the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> when met together in a religious Manner, either by Blows or otherwi&s;e; then he looking upon me, I dur&s;t not touch one of them. After &s;ome Time, I de&s;ired to be much alone, and in my &s;till and quiet Retire|ments, the Lord was very good unto me, and gave me many a heavenly Vi&s;itation, and tho' it was in Judgment, yet that was my Portion, and I patiently bore them, and came to love his Judgments and Vi|&s;itations, and they became to me very &s;weet and plea&s;ant, and of more Value than <HI>Rubies,</HI> and was my great Delight; and with them I was very well plea&s;ed,
<PB N="14" REF="002654_0014_0FE5DB5A1C170270">
becau&s;e they brought me into much Ten|derne&s;s for the which I loved them at my very Heart, for it was a Heart-work; and many Times when alone, the Lord would break in upon me, by the in-&s;hining of his glorious Light in my own Heart, melted me, and mollified me: Yea, &s;o powerful|ly many Times, that I could not contain, or forbear crying out, <HI>O Lord!</HI> In&s;omuch that the Profe&s;&s;ors could not tell what to make of it: But I knew and felt it to be the mighty Power of God, which brought and wrought Deliverance into my Soul; and with this Exerci&s;e, and many more, I continued about &s;ix Months, being taken off all outward Concerns, and being alone, &s;ome &s;aid I was mad, others I was di|&s;tracted; and &s;o wrote Home to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Many came on Board to &s;ee me, thinking the Shape of my Body was alter'd, and I heard &s;ome &s;ay, that <HI>my Body was of the &s;ame Shape, but I looked like a dumb Saint.</HI> In &s;hort, I was a Scoff and Deri&s;ion with all &s;orts of Profe&s;&s;ors, except the People called <HI>Qua|kers;</HI> but I was one of them in my Heart, tho' not yet joined to them, for the Cro&s;s was too hard for me as yet, but many a Time I felt that living, eternal Power, which hath made me both to tremble and quake, and was glad when it was &s;o with
<PB N="15" REF="002654_0015_0FE5DB5E38EBEE10">
me; yet then I was no profe&s;s'd <HI>Quaker,</HI> for the Cro&s;s was &s;till too hard for me.</P>
<P>But it was the Lord's good Will, and ble&s;&s;ed be his Holy Name for it; that af|ter the many Judgments and &s;ore inward Afflictions, it was his good Will and Plea&s;ure, to bring my Will to be &s;ubject to his Will, for in tho&s;e dark Times, I was fully given up; yea, Life and all, to have Peace in my Con&s;cience with God, for that was the Thing, and the only thing that my Heart thir&s;ted after.</P>
<P>And one Evening being alone, (for in that I took great Delight,) and being low in my Mind, I was very earne&s;t with the Lord to know what People I &s;hould join my &s;elf unto, for then I was alone; and it was plainly &s;hewed me the <HI>Quakers;</HI> of which Number the Man I loved &s;o well was ac|counted; and being one that I formerly highly e&s;teemed, and who had the Check upon me, when I was in the Height of Cruelty again&s;t the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> then on Board, as is before-mentioned. But the Thing at that Time did &s;tartle me, that I de&s;ired of the Lord, rather to die than live, for the rea&s;oning Part got up: What to &s;uch a People, that both Prie&s;t and Profe&s;&s;ors are again&s;t! What to &s;uch a People, that I have been &s;o long beating and abu&s;ing, and that without ju&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="002654_0016_0FE5DB5F9F97B520">
Cau&s;e! Death would be more welcome to me. And here the Enemy, that old &s;ub|tile Serpent, was not wanting to in&s;inuate many Things into my Mind: But God was plea&s;ed to put me in Mind of the manifold Pre&s;ervations and Deliverances he had brought me through; &s;o I took up this Re&s;olution, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Lord, <HI>Whether</HI> Quaker, <HI>or no</HI> Quaker, <HI>Peace with God I am for:</HI> Yet it co&s;t me many a bit|ter Sigh, and many a Tear, before I could give up to go to <HI>Roger Dennis,</HI> my Friend, called a <HI>Quaker:</HI> But good was the Lord, and for ever ble&s;&s;ed be his worthy Name, who followed me with his dreadful Judg|ments and Reproofs: In&s;omuch that I could contain no longer, but gave up and went to my Friend <HI>Roger Dennis,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>I would &s;peak with thee,</HI> and he very mildly an&s;wer|ed, <HI>I will go with thee:</HI> I having a Cabin, we went down, and when in, I &s;hut the Door, and we &s;at &s;ome Time; and before he open'd his Mouth, the Hand of the Lord was upon me, and melted my Heart, and brought me into great Tenderne&s;s, and then he &s;pake but a few Words, but they were in great Humility and Tender|ne&s;s towards me, hitting the Mark to a Hair's Breadth; &s;o that I had great Sa|tisfaction, being quiet in my Mind, and we parted in great Love.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002654_0017_0FE5DB6105A35FE8">Not long after, the old Enemy, the Devil, was very bu&s;y: <HI>What! to join thy &s;elf to &s;uch a fooli&s;h People!</HI> And many more of his Stratagems; for he was like to lo&s;e his Dominion, which made him the more furious to attack me: So that I was even weary of my Life, yet longed for the Fir&s;t Day, that I might go to the Meeting; and it was the fir&s;t that ever I was at: And at the Time appointed, I went to the Meeting with a great Dread upon my Mind, and &s;at me down in great Quietne&s;s among&s;t them, they being then but &s;ix Men.</P>
<P>I had not been long there, but it was re|ported in the publick Place of Wor&s;hip, that I was among&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> at which, many of them left the Prie&s;t and his Wor&s;hip, to come and &s;ee me: And they made a great Noi&s;e and Bu&s;tle. When the Wor&s;hip was over, the Captain ask'd the Rea&s;on of that Noi&s;e? and it was told him, that I was among&s;t the <HI>Quakers:</HI> Then he &s;ent for me to him&s;elf, and divers more of his Officers were there: The fir&s;t that began was the Prie&s;t, &s;aying, <HI>Thomas, I took you for a very hone&s;t Man, and a good Chri&s;tian, but I am &s;orry you &s;hould be &s;o deluded.</HI> The mean while the Captain turning the Bible from one End to the other, to prove the <HI>Qua|kers</HI> no <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> All this while I was very quiet and &s;till in my Mind; for I found
<PB N="18" REF="002654_0018_0FE5DB6272A44390">
therein was my Strength: And when they &s;aw they could not prevail upon me, then they fell to &s;landering of me, &s;aying, That at &s;uch and &s;uch a Time the <HI>Quakers</HI> came to me, &s;aying, Do &s;uch and &s;uch a thing: which was all fal&s;e, by which I got great Strength: For never any <HI>Quaker</HI> came to me, but <HI>Roger Dennis,</HI> one that I dearly lov|ed, and de&s;ired his Company, and that was but the Night before. So when they had done, I went to my Friends in great Peace and Satisfaction, &s;aying to them, That <HI>when I went to the Captain, I was &s;carce half a</HI> Qua|ker, <HI>but by their Lies and fal&s;e Reports again&s;t me, they have made me almo&s;t a whole</HI> Quaker, <HI>or at lea&s;t I hope to be one.</HI> My Friends re|ceived me in much Love and Tenderne&s;s, and ever after I kept to their Meetings.</P>
<P>After this, Truth prevailed very much, and had a great Sway in the Ship, and &s;e|veral were convinced; &s;o that when I came among them, there was but &s;ix; but in le&s;s than &s;ix Months after, we were twelve Men and two Boys, of which one was the Prie&s;t's.</P>
<P>There was &s;uch a Blow given to Per&s;e|cution, that it never got up again, whil&s;t in that Ship, tho' much try'd for by the Captain; for he got &s;everal Men out of other Ships, on purpo&s;e to per&s;ecute the <HI>Quakers;</HI> who came with great &s;welling

<P>About this Time we had a great Sick|ne&s;s, which &s;wept away above Forty in a little Time; and mo&s;t of us, call'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> had the Di&s;temper, but none died of it, yet were brought very low.

And now all was very quiet, no Per&s;ecution, but a ge|neral Love among&s;t all &s;orts of Per&s;ua&s;i|ons that were then on Board, and Truth had great Dominion, and &s;everal were con|vinc'd.</P>

<P>Now all Things were in Quiet, and the Captain continued our Friend for &s;ome Time, and &s;hewed us more Kindne&s;s than any other Profe&s;&s;ors; The Captain would often &s;ay, <HI>Thomas, take thy Friends; do &s;o and &s;o, or &s;uch and &s;uch a thing;</HI> and I took my Friends, and did it far beyond his Ex|pectation, by which he got great Credit: For as yet we were not brought to te|&s;tify again&s;t Fighting; yet we would take none of the Plunder.

<P>So here the Captain, who had been our Friend, and a Shelter to us from wicked Men, is now become again our Enemy, and we left open to every wicked Spirit to kill us, when&s;oever we deny to fight: For the printed Orders fixed upon the Ship &s;ays, <HI>If any Man flinch from his Quarters in Time of</HI> Engagement, <HI>any may kill him:</HI> Yet for all the hard Things, I had a &s;ecret Hope and Belief, that if we &s;tood true to what the Lord had made known unto us, the Lord would deliver us out of all their Hands.</P>

<P>I <HI>Thomas Lurting,</HI> was then <HI>George Patti&s;on</HI>'s Mate, and coming from <HI>Venice,</HI> we heard that many <HI>Turks</HI> Men of War were at Sea, and that they had taken many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships; and it was much in thy Mind, that we &s;hould be taken: and I was ve|ry much concerned, as well for the Men, as for my &s;elf; at which I went to the Ma&s;ter, and de|&s;ir'd of him to go to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and to &s;tay for a Convoy, and &s;o long we would have no Wages; but the Ma&s;ter would not agree to this, but kept the Sea, much contrary to our Minds: And com|ing near a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> I&s;land, call'd <HI>May-York,</HI> we were cha&s;ed by a <HI>Turks</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, or a Man of War, called a <HI>Pata<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h,</HI> as &s;ome Time before we had been; and thought by our Ve&s;&s;el's well &s;ailing, to e&s;cape; but by carrying over-much Sail, &s;ome of our ma|terials gave Way, by which Means the <HI>Turks</HI> came up with us, and commanded the Ma&s;ter on Board; who accordingly went, with four Men more, lea|ving me, and three Men and a Boy, on Board our Ve&s;&s;el; and &s;o &s;oon as our Boat came on Board the <HI>Turks</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, they took all our Men out of the Boat, and put in Fourteen <HI>Turks.</HI> All this while I was under a great Exerci&s;e in Spirit, not &s;o much for my &s;elf, becau&s;e I had a &s;ecret Hope of Relief, but a great Stre&s;s lay upon me for the Men, in this very Juncture of Time; for all Hopes of outward Deliverance being then gone, the Ma&s;ter then on Board the <HI>Turks,</HI> with Four of our Men,

and the <HI>Turks</HI> ju&s;t coming on Board of us: And being much concerned in Mind, I de&s;ired of the Lord Patience under &s;uch an Exerci&s;e; and going to the Ship's Side to &s;ee the <HI>Turks</HI> come in, the Word of the Lord ran thro' me, thus; <HI>Be not a|fraid, for all this, thou &s;halt not go to</HI> Algier: And I having formerly great Experience of the Lord's Doings upon &s;everal Deliverances in Times of War, I believed what the Lord did &s;ay in me. At this all kind of Fear was removed, and I received them, as a Man might his Friends, and they were as Civil to us. So I &s;hewed them all Parts of the Ve&s;&s;el, and what &s;he was laden withal; then &s;aid I to our Men, <HI>Be not afraid, for all this, we &s;hall not go to</HI> Algier; <HI>but let me de&s;ire you, as you have been willing to obey me, &s;o be as willing to obey the</HI> Turks; for by our &s;o doing, we got over them: For when they &s;aw our great Diligence, it made them the more carele&s;s of, and favourable to us. So when they had taken &s;ome &s;mall Matter of what we were laden withal, &s;ome went on Board their own Ship again, and eight <HI>Turks</HI> &s;tay'd with us. Then began I to think of the Ma&s;ter, and the other four, which were in the <HI>Turks</HI> Ship; for as for my &s;elf, and the others with me, I had no Fear at all; nay, I was &s;o far from it, that I &s;aid to one of our Men, <HI>Were but the Ma&s;ter on Board, and the re&s;t of our Men, if there were twice as many</HI> Turks, <HI>I &s;hould not fear them.</HI> For my earne&s;t De&s;ire was to the Lord, that he would put it into their Hearts to &s;end them on Board; and good was the Lord, in an&s;wering my De&s;ire; for it was as a Seal to what he before had &s;poke thro' me, and in me. Soon af|ter this, the Ma&s;ter was &s;ent on Board, with the re&s;t of our Men. Then all Manner of Fear was off me, as to going to <HI>Algier;</HI> and &s;ome &s;aid to me, <HI>I was a &s;trange Man, I was afraid before we were taken, but now I was not.</HI> My An&s;wer was, <HI>I now believe I &s;hall not go to</HI> Algier, <HI>and if you will be ruled by me, I will act for your Delivery, as well

as any own;</HI> but as yet I &s;aw no Way for it, for they were all arm'd, and we without Arms. Now we being all together, except the Ma&s;ter, I began to rea&s;on with them: <HI>What if we &s;hould overcome the</HI> Turks, <HI>and go to</HI> May-York? At which they very much rejoyced; and one &s;aid, <HI>I will kill one or two;</HI> and another &s;aid, <HI>I will cut as many of their Throats as you will have me:</HI> This was our Men's An&s;wer; at which I was much troubled, and &s;aid to them, <HI>If I know any of you that offers to touch a</HI> Turk, <HI>I will tell the</HI> Turks <HI>my &s;elf:</HI> But I &s;aid to them, <HI>If you will be ruled, I will act for you; if not, I will be &s;till:</HI> Then they agreed to do what I would have them. Then &s;aid I, <HI>If the</HI> Turks <HI>bid you do any Thing, do it without grumbling, and with as much Diligence and Quickne&s;s as you can; for that plea&s;es them, and that will cau&s;e them to let us be together:</HI> to which they agreed. Then I went to our Ma&s;ter, who was a Friend and a very bold-&s;pirited Man, and told him our Intenti|on; who&s;e An&s;wer to me was, <HI>If we offer'd to ri&s;e, and they overcame us, we had as good be burnt a|live.</HI> The which I knew very well: But I could get him no Way to adhere to me, in that he was fearful of Blood&s;hed, for that was his Rea&s;on: In|&s;omuch that at la&s;t I told him, <HI>we were re&s;olv'd, and I que&s;tion'd not but to do it, without one Drop of Blood&s;hed;</HI> and I believed that the Lord would pro&s;per it, by rea&s;on I could rather go to <HI>Algier,</HI> than to kill one <HI>Turk.</HI> So at la&s;t he agreed to this, to let me do what I would, provided we killed none. At that Time, there being &s;till two <HI>Turks</HI> lying in the Cabin with him; &s;o he was to lie in the Cabin, that by his being there, they &s;hould mi&s;tru&s;t nothing: which accordingly he did; and having bad Weather, and lo&s;t the Company of the Man of War, which thing I much de&s;ired; the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eeing our Diligence, made them carele&s;s of us.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="002654_0040_0FE5DB940DDA3808">The &s;econd Night, after the Captain and one of the <HI>Turks</HI> went to Sleep in the Cabin with our Ma|&s;ter; then I per&s;uaded one to lie in my Cabin, and about an Hour after, another in another Cabin; until at la&s;t, it rained very much, I per&s;waded them all down to Sleep; and when a&s;leep, I got their Arms in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and all this was done by fair Means and Per&s;ua&s;ions.</P>
<P>Then &s;aid I to the Men of our Ve&s;&s;el, <HI>Now we have the</HI> Turks <HI>at our Command, no Man &s;hall hurt any of them; for if you do, I will be again&s;t you; but this we will do, now they are under Deck, we will keep them &s;o, and go for</HI> May-York. So when I had ordered &s;ome to keep the Doors, le&s;t any &s;hould come out, &s;trictly charging 'em not to &s;pill Blood; and &s;o order'd our Cour&s;e for <HI>May-York;</HI> the which in the Morning we were near. Then my Or|ders to our Men was, if any offer'd to come out, not to let above one or two at a Time; and one came out expecting to have &s;een his own Country; but to the contrary, it was <HI>May-York:</HI> Then &s;aid I to our Men, <HI>Be careful of the Door, for when he goes in, we &s;hall &s;ee what they will do:</HI> And as &s;oon as he told them, we were going towards <HI>May-York,</HI> they, in&s;tead of Ri&s;ing, fell all to Crying; for their Courage was taken from them, and they de&s;ired that they might not be &s;old; which I promi&s;ed they &s;hould not; and &s;o &s;oon as I had pacified them, I went into the Cabin to our Ma&s;ter, he not knowing what was done and &s;o he told their Cap|tain, <HI>That we had overcome his Men, and were go|ing for</HI> May-York: At which unexpected News he wept; and de&s;ired the Ma&s;ter not to &s;ell him; which he promi&s;ed he would not. Then we told the Captain, we would make a Place to hide them in, where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould not find them; at which they were very glad, and we did according|ly. So when we came in, the Ma&s;ter went on Shore, with Four more, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t me on Board with

the <HI>Turks,</HI> which were ten; but they could not come out, except I let them: And when he had done his Bu&s;ine&s;s, not taking Product or Licen&s;e, le&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould come and &s;ee the <HI>Turks.</HI> But at Night an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma&s;ter came on Board, being an Acquaintance; and after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with him, we told him, if he would not betray us, we would tell him what we had done; but we would not have the <HI>Spaniards</HI> know it, le&s;t they &s;hould take them from us; the which he promi&s;ed, but brake the &s;ame, and would have had two or three of them, to have brought to <HI>England;</HI> but we &s;aw his End: And when he &s;aw he could not prevail, then he &s;aid, They are worth two or three hundred Pieces of Eight each: whereat both the Ma&s;ter and I told him, <HI>That if they would give many Thou&s;ands, they &s;hould not have one, for we hoped to &s;end them home again.</HI></P>
<P>But he look'd upon us as Fools, becau&s;e we would not &s;ell them; which I would not have done for the whole I&s;land: But contrary to our Expectati|on, he told the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who threatned to take them from us: But &s;o &s;oon as we heard thereof, we call'd up the <HI>Turks,</HI> and told them, <HI>They mu&s;t help us, or the</HI> Spaniards <HI>would take them from us:</HI> So they re&s;olvedly helped us, and we made all Ha&s;te to run from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> which plea&s;ed the <HI>Turks</HI> very well.
