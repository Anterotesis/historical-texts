<P>_THE Words are among &s;ome of the la&s;t of the wi&s;e <HI>Solomons;</HI> his dying Pre|cept and Coun&s;el (as it were) to Young People. He was now Old, and happily recovered to GOD by His Grace, from whom he had fallen after a pious Education, and a very gracious beginning of his life: And now in the day of his repentance, and after &s;uch an experience both of good and evil, of wi&s;|dom and folly, as &s;carce any one ever had the like before him, he addre&s;&s;es this <HI>Exhortation</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002102_0003_0FBB802D0094D590">to Young People, to <HI>remember their Creator now in the days of their Youth;</HI> inforcing it with an <HI>Argument</HI> which he had felt the rea&s;on of and which became his Age and &s;ad Expe|riment, &mdash; <HI>while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh when thou &s;halt &s;ay, I have no plea&s;ure in them.</HI></P>
<P>LET Young People therefore hear with Re|verence the words of the <HI>Preacher,</HI> the Royal Preacher, King of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> who in the clo&s;e of this his practical and penitential <HI>Sermon</HI> warns and admoni&s;hes them; coun&s;els, directs and charges them; <HI>Remember now thy CREATOR in the days of thy Youth.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the In&s;tant and important <HI>Duty</HI> of Young People; And I &s;hall endeavour here to &s;how them,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That they have a CREATOR.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What it is to <HI>remember</HI> Him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That they mu&s;t remember Him <HI>now, in the days of their Youth.</HI></ITEM>

<P N="1">1. I am to &s;hew thee, O Young Per&s;on, that thou ha&s;t a CREATOR, and who is thy <HI>Creator.</HI> The Great GOD is the CREATOR of all things&punc; <HI>GOD that made the World and all things in it, who is Lord of Heaven and Earth,</HI> He is thy MAKER; and <HI>has made of one Blood all Nations of men that dwell on all the face of the earth,</HI> Act. 17.24. <HI>The LORD that &s;tretcheth forth the Heavens, and layeth the foundation of the Earth, and who formeth the Spirit of man within him,</HI> Zech. 12.1.</P>
<P>THERE is but One GOD and no other be&s;ide Him. The LORD JEHOVAH is the One true
<PB N="3" REF="002102_0004_0FBB802EC49E30A0">and living GOD. And by Faith we under|&s;tand that the Worlds were made by Him. I&s;ai&punc; 44.34. <HI>Thus &s;aith the LORD thy Redeemer, and He that formed thee from the womb; I am the LORD that maketh all things, that &s;tretched forth the Heavens alone, that &s;preadeth abroad the earth by my &s;elf.</HI> Jer. 10.11, 16. <HI>The god's that have not made the Heavens and the Earth, even they &s;hall peri&s;h from the earth and from under the&s;e heavens; the Portion of Jacob is not like them, for He is the FORMER of all things, the LORD of HOSTS is his name: He hath made the Earth by his power, He hath e&s;tabli&s;hed the World by his wi&s;dom, and &s;tretched out the Hea|vens by his di&s;cretion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>MOSES</HI> informs us in the manner of our Creation: Gen. 2.7. <HI>The LORD GOD formed Man out of the du&s;t of the earth, and breathed into his no&s;trils the breath of life, and Man be|came a Living Soul.</HI> And He who made the fir&s;t Man is the <HI>Creator</HI> of every Individual, Son or Daughter that has proceeded from him, or that are yet to be born. We mu&s;t own our &s;elves the Divine Workman&s;hip, and <HI>bow down and kneel before the LORD our Maker.</HI> P&s;al. 100.3. <HI>Know ye that the LORD he is GOD, it is He that made us and not we our &s;elves.</HI> When we look upon our curious <HI>Bodies,</HI> we mu&s;t lift up our admiring eyes to Heaven and &s;ay, Joh, 10.8. <HI>Thine hands have made me and fa&s;hioned me round about.</HI> And when we look in upon our <HI>Souls,</HI> which as plainly perceive their own Exi&s;tence powers and operations, as our Eyes &s;urvey the
<PB N="4" REF="002102_0005_0FBB803121058D60">form and parts of our Bodies, we mu&s;t again adore before the <HI>Father of Spirits,</HI> the <HI>Creator</HI> of Angels and the <HI>Former</HI> of the Spi|rit of Man within him, and &s;ay, Jer. 38.16. <HI>The Lord liveth that made us this Soul.</HI></P>
<P>So has the LORD our <HI>Maker</HI> &s;poken of Him|&s;elf, and reveal'd Him&s;elf to us; that we may know that we have a <HI>Creator,</HI> and Who He is.</P>
<P N="2">II. I come to Enquire, WHAT it is for us to <HI>remember our Creator?</HI> And to be &s;ure it is here a word of great Import and Significancy, and means much; for it &s;tands for every thing that the Young Man owes to the GOD of his Being and Life. More particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. It means that we be often <HI>thinking</HI> of the Great and Ble&s;&s;ed BEING, who has made us and all things, and that we do always pre|&s;erve and keep in our minds a lively and reli|gious Apprehen&s;ion of His Being, Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, Perfection and Glory.</P>
<P>RELIGION very much con&s;i&s;ts in and is pre&s;erved by our having right and honourable tho'ts of God, and &s;etting Him always before us. And Fir&s;t,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE mu&s;t &s;tedfa&s;tly believe and &s;trongly realize His <HI>Being;</HI> which is &s;uppo&s;ed in the Act of remembring Him; for how can we remember that which we &s;uppo&s;e not to be, or que&s;tion the Being of? Wherefore as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, Heb. 11.6. <HI>He that cometh to God mu&s;t fir&s;t believe that he is.</HI> Nor is this the ea&s;ie&s;t thing in the World for us to do, tho' it
<PB N="5" REF="002102_0006_0FBB80339C463C48">be one of the plaine&s;t things in the World to be proved, that GOD is: Becau&s;e there is abun|dance of unbelief and infidelity in the hearts of the Children of Men, which is one great part and proof of the Corruption of our Nature; P&s;al. 14.1, 2. <HI>The fool hath &s;aid in his heart there is no God, they are corrupt, there is none that do under&s;tand and &s;eek God.</HI> Job. 35.10. <HI>None &s;aith, where is God my Maker</HI>&mdash;. P&s;al. 10.4. <HI>God is not in all their thoughts.</HI> This proves an un|accountable Athei&s;m lurking in the hearts of Men. For the fir&s;t thing in Religion is that, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 17.7. <HI>A man &s;hall look to his Maker, and his eyes have re&s;pect to the Holy One of I&s;rael.</HI> And what irreligion can be greater than that, I&s;ai. 51.13. <HI>And forgette&s;t the Lord thy Maker, that hath &s;tretched forth the Heavens, and laid the foun|dations of the Earth.</HI> Now when we have rea|liz'd the Being of God, and fix'd that fir&s;t Prin|ciple deep in our hearts, which God Him&s;elf mu&s;t do for us; then,</P>
<P N="2">2. WE mu&s;t always bear in mind <HI>What</HI> He is; that &s;o we may ever maintain <HI>worthy Idea's</HI> of Him, and always think becomingly and re|verently of His Glorious Name. We mu&s;t therefore form our Conceptions of the Great GOD from His holy Word, wherein He has &s;poken in a manner worthy of Him&s;elf, the things that are true of Him&s;elf; <HI>for the Spirit &s;earcheth all things, even the deep things of God, and has revealed them unto us.</HI> We mu&s;t accord|ingly believe that God is the Immen&s;e, Infinite, Eternal and Unchangeable Spirit, Self-exi&s;tent,
<PB N="6" REF="002102_0007_0FBB8034788BFF78">and Ble&s;&s;ed for evermore, the fir&s;t Cau&s;e, Au|thor and Creator of all things, and the Pre&s;er|ver and Governour of all; for who&s;e Glory all things are and were Created, and in the Being and Government of all things His Per|fections and Glories do &s;hine forth: therefore that He is (as is clearly &s;een from the things that are made) a Being mo&s;t High, mo&s;t Wi&s;e, Almighty, mo&s;t Good, mo&s;t Holy, True &amp; Ju&s;t. And we mu&s;t ever remember that this ble&s;&s;ed and glorious and fearful BEING is ever pre&s;ent with us, and that we are always before Him. Unle&s;s we have the&s;e great worthy tho'ts of GOD, it will be no honour done him if we remember him; for an unworthy tho't of Him is to do him di&s;honour; as for in&s;tance, &s;hould we own his Being and with-hold any divine Attribute and Glory from Him: &s;hou'd we &s;ay as they did&mdash;<HI>How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the mo&s;t High? The Lord &s;hall not &s;ee, neither &s;hall the God of I&s;rael regard it?</HI>&mdash;this were to frame to our &s;elves a de|fective, lame and imperfect <HI>Deity;</HI> and in effect <HI>to think him altogether &s;uch a one as our &s;elves,</HI> and &s;ink him down into an <HI>Idol</HI> or Image; a god that is good for nothing, neither great, nor to be feared, nor to be tru&s;ted in. Where|fore if we would at all <HI>remember our</HI> CREATOR, we mu&s;t be &s;ure to bear in mind a very worthy Idea of Him; <HI>What</HI> he is in him&s;elf; <HI>how glo|rious and fearful his Name is,</HI> And then,</P>
<P N="3">3. As our <HI>Text</HI> requires me to add, We mu&s;t remember what He is <HI>to us: Thy</HI> CREATOR.
<PB N="7" REF="002102_0008_0FBB8035F84578C8">We mu&s;t con&s;ider him in the <HI>Relations</HI> wherein he &s;tands to us; without which we had as good never remember him at all: for without this we &s;hall neither honour him nor benefit our &s;elves by any remembrance of him. Nei|ther indeed can a Creature remember his <HI>Maker,</HI> but the relation he herein &s;tands to God mu&s;t be a principal thing in the remembrance. When|ever we remember God it mu&s;t be as our Maker. Pre&s;erver, Lord, King and Judge; our Saviour, Redeemer, and great Benefactor: that we have receiv'd our Being from him, and in him we live and move and have it; and that God has made us for him&s;elf, form'd us for his own Prai&s;e: that we are not our own, nor to live unto our &s;elves, but that we depend on God, and mu&s;t account to him, and can be &s;aved only by him. This is the acknowledg|ment of God which the HOLY GHOST has led us into: <HI>Thou O Lord art our Father, and we all are the work of thy hand. We are the clay &amp; thou our potter: We are his People and the &s;heep of his hands, for of him and to him are all things. He is the God of the Spirits of all fle&s;h: in his hand is every living Soul, and the breath of all mankind. The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King. He is our Father in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Thus to remember our CREATOR implies our thinking often of the Great and Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Being</HI> who has made us and all things; and that we do always pre&s;erve and keep in our minds a lively and religious apprehen&s;ion of
<PB N="8" REF="002102_0009_0FBB8038EA914720">his Being, ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, perfection and glory: that God is, and what he is in him&s;elf, and what he is unto us. Not a day, nor yet an hour &s;hould pa&s;s us, without &s;ome actual re|membrance of our ble&s;&s;ed Maker, Pre&s;erver, Judge and Saviour. And we &s;hould never pa&s;s a tho't of this great and ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Being,</HI> without a mo&s;t profound veneration, fear and love.</P>
<P>Which leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. THE remembring of our CREATOR mu&s;t be with a Mind and Soul <HI>duly affected</HI> with the glorious Idea of Him, and toward the glorify|ing him. We mu&s;t remember him with <HI>ad|miring</HI> and adoring Souls; we mu&s;t remember him with a holy <HI>fear</HI> and dread; we mu&s;t re|member him with <HI>love,</HI> gratitude and delight of Soul; <HI>The de&s;ire of our Souls mu&s;t be unto his Name and to the remembrance of him: Our medi|tation of him &s;hould be &s;weet unto us, and we &s;hould be glad in the Lord.</HI> We mu&s;t remember him and <HI>tru&s;t</HI> in him, who&s;e Name is a &s;trong Tower; the righteous flyeth thereunto and are &s;afe. P&s;al. 20.7. <HI>Some tru&s;t in chariots and &s;ome in hor&s;es, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.</HI> We mu&s;t remember who and what he is and re&s;ign to him in all that He in his Governing Wi&s;dom orders for us. As <HI>Elihu</HI> teaches, Job. 26.2, 3. <HI>Suffer me a little, and I will &s;hew thee that I have yet to &s;peak on God's behalf; I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will a&s;cribe righteou&s;ne&s;s to my Maker: He that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</HI> In a word, We mu&s;t remember
<PB N="9" REF="002102_0010_0FBB803CD03D16D8">our CREATOR and <HI>device</HI> our &s;elves to him for ever; make our <HI>Choice</HI> of him for our God and portion, and the <HI>Con&s;ecration</HI> of our &s;elves to him, to his &s;ervice and glory here and here|after believing in his Covenant-faithfulne&s;s, and looking for his &s;ure mercies, and the Ever|la&s;ting Enjoyment of Him in &s;upream glory and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. So the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t remembred God upon his bed, and meditated on him in the night watches; his &s;oul follow'd hard after him, and in the &s;hadow of his wings he did rejoyce,</HI> P&s;al. 6.3.7.</P>
<P>THIS is to remember God with the religi|ous veneration of Creatures that are made capable of knowing him and loving him; and O how thankful &s;hould <HI>Sinners</HI> be that they may and can thus remember their <HI>Holy CREATOR;</HI> remember him and not be <HI>trou|bled,</HI> not be confounded and overwhelmed at the remenbrance of him.</P>
<P>IN this <HI>Affective &s;en&s;e</HI> we pray that God would <HI>remember us;</HI> that he would think upon us for good according to our needs, <HI>re|member that we are du&s;t; remember us with the favour that be bears unto his cho&s;en: remember all our offerings, and accept our burnt-&s;acrifices; remember for us his tender mercies and his loving kindne&s;s, which have been ever of old.</HI> And if this be for God to remember us, then for <HI>us</HI> to remember him can mean nothing le&s;s than that we bear upon our minds and hearts, a <HI>due and lively &s;en&s;e</HI> of his Excellent Maje&s;ty and Great|ne&s;s, of his Poline&s;s and Purity, of his Ju&s;tice
<PB N="10" REF="002102_0011_0FBB803E37991FB0">and Truth, of his Grace and Mercy (the glory wherein he pa&s;&s;es before &s;inful Men) and ren|der him tho&s;e pious Affections which the&s;e Glories of his exalted Name call for from us.</P>
<P>IN this latitude and extent the <HI>Text</HI> is to be under&s;tood, and &s;uch let thy Remembrance of God thy CREATOR always be: <HI>Sanctifying</HI> to thy Soul, and having the <HI>Government</HI> of thy Life: This is that remembring of God which only is <HI>worthy</HI> of Him, who <HI>&s;earches</HI> the heart and who demands it of us; who is a <HI>jealous God and will not be mocked; and if thou &s;ay&s;t&mdash; Behold we know it not,&mdash;doth not he that ponder|eth the heart con&s;ider it? and he that k<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">eth thy Soul doth not be know it? and &s;hall be not render to every man according to his Works?</HI></P>
<P>AND thus we have con&s;idered the <HI>Import</HI> of the Duty pre&s;cribed in the <HI>Text, What</HI> it is to remember our CREATOR. I &s;hall now add a few words with re&s;pect to our manife&s; <HI>Obligations</HI> to do &s;o. And Fir&s;t,</P>
<P N="1">1. WHAT &s;erve our <HI>Eyes</HI> and the vi&s;ible <HI>Works</HI> of God for, but to remember us of our <HI>Creator?</HI> As &s;oon as we do but ob&s;erve and con|&s;ider the <HI>Light</HI> which God has made for us to &s;ee by, and our Eyes <HI>the light of the body</HI> by which we &s;ee, and the various beauteous <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> which &s;urround us and pre&s;ent them&s;elves unto our &s;ight; what mu&s;t we fir&s;t think or but the GOD that made all the&s;e things? made them in the elegant <HI>Order</HI> wherein they are and as in the elegant <HI>Form</HI> wherein we behold our &s;elves? that is to &s;ay, the fir&s;t thing that occurs to the
<PB N="11" REF="002102_0012_0FBB803FB8FBE018">rational Mind, upon his &s;urveying his own Body and the vi&s;ible Univer&s;e is the Greatne&s;s and Glory of the <HI>Creator.</HI> This the Man is in&s;tant|ly put in mind of, namely Of the <HI>GOD</HI> that made him and all the&s;e things. For <HI>the Hea|vens declare the glory of God, and the firmament &s;heweth his handy work, day unto day uttereth &s;peech, and night unto night &s;heweth knowledge,</HI> P&s;al. 19.1, 2. That Per&s;on is &s;tupid and bruiti&s;h therefore that live in &s;uch a World as this is, and minds not <HI>the invi&s;ible things of GOD, which are &s;o clearly &s;een from the things which are made, even His Eternal Power and God-head.</HI> We are <HI>utterly without excu&s;e if we do not know God and glorify him as God,</HI> with admiring and thankful Souls; becau&s;e <HI>that which may be known of God is manife&s;t</HI> in the&s;e his Works; wherein God hath &s;hewed of him&s;elf to us, even the glories of his Incorruptible GODHEAD, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.20.</P>
<P>WHO can behold the <HI>Sun</HI> when it &s;hines, or the <HI>Moon walking in brightne&s;s,</HI> and not own <HI>the GOD that is above?</HI> Or when we <HI>con&s;ider God's Heavens the work of his &s;ingers, the Moon and the Stars which he has ordained;</HI> mu&s;t we not admire the Greatne&s;s and Conde&s;cention of God in what he has done for us <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 8. <HI>Init.</HI> We mu&s;t either make <HI>God's</HI> of the Ho&s;ts of Heaven and wor&s;hip them, as the <HI>Heathens</HI> fooli&s;hly did, to the infinite di&s;honour &amp; offence of the Great CREATOR; or we mu&s;t fall down and adore Him, who <HI>has divided them among all the Nations of Men that dwell on the face of the whole Earth.</HI> Deut. 4.19. Why has God <HI>&s;pread
<PB N="12" REF="002102_0013_0FBB804215ACEB70">out the skye over us,</HI> which is (as He Him&s;elf &s;ays of it) like <HI>a Molten looking-gla&s;s,</HI> but that when we look up into it we may &s;ee the CREATOR, the Face of GOD in it. Every Work and every Creature of GOD which Man beholds with his natural eye, loudly proclaims to him the <HI>Creators</HI> Being, perfections and glories, and bids him to remember Him. When God had gone thro' a long and &s;ublime Account of his Works, in one part and another of the vi&s;ible Creation, then <HI>Job</HI> cries out&mdash;<HI>Now mine eye &s;eeth-thee.</HI> The <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> could not look upon the&s;e, but as one dazled with the Creators Glory, he breaks out, P&s;al. 104. <HI>O Lord my God thou art very great, thou art clothed with honour and maje&s;ty, who covere&s;t thy &s;elf with light as with a Garment; who &s;tretche&s;t out the Heavens as a Curtain; who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, who maketh the clouds his chariots, and walketh upon the wings of the wind: the Glory of the Lord &s;hall endure for ever, the Lord &s;hall rejoyce in his works.</HI> And again he calls upon the <HI>Sun and Moon and Stars of light</HI> to prai&s;e their MAKER; yea upon <HI>Mountains &amp; all Hills, Eea&s;ts and all Cattle, as well as Kings of the Earth and all People.</HI></P>
<P>BUT we need not look off from our own <HI>Bodies,</HI> to be put in mind of GOD. Let us but look in one anothers <HI>Faces,</HI> and ob&s;erve their beauty and comely proportion, the Grandeur and Maje&s;ty which is vi&s;ible therein, and can we forget the GOD that has form'd us what we are? Who fram'd the&s;e elegant Bodies, this
<PB N="13" REF="002102_0014_0FBB804504723EA0">&s;ublime Countenance, the&s;e &s;eeing eyes, and hearing ears, and &s;peaking mouths, and agile hands? <HI>He</HI> that fir&s;t made he Earth, he only could thus refine it and animate it. <HI>Remem|ber I be&s;eech you Him that his form'd you of the clay!</HI> You mu&s;t forget your &s;elves &s;ooner than you can your CREATOR. Or, were you deaf and blind and dumb and lame, yet there would remain eno' to remember you of GOD. Job. 10. 10. <HI>Thou ha&s;t clothed me with skin and fle&s;h, and ha&s;t fenced me with bones and &s;inews.</HI> P&s;al. 139. 14. <HI>I will prai&s;e thee, for I am fearfully and won|derfully made; marvellous are thy works and that my &s;oul knoweth right will.</HI></P>
<P>Now what &s;erve the&s;e vi&s;ible <HI>Works</HI> of God to us, if not to remember us of Him from day to day? the&s;e call upon, and admoni&s;h us from day to day to keep him ever in our <HI>minds,</HI> for they keep him ever in our <HI>&s;ight;</HI> and <HI>our eyes &s;hould affect our hearts.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. WHAT &s;erve our <HI>Souls</HI> for, and tho&s;e <HI>rational Powers</HI> wherewith God has endowed us, but to remember him. <HI>There is a Spirit in Man, and the in&s;piration of the Almighty giveth us under&s;tanding.</HI> This we are as &s;en&s;ible of, and the operations of our living Souls are as evident to us, and to one another, as the light of the Sun is to our eyes, and the forms of every Creature. We think, we &s;peak, we rea|&s;on and di&s;cour&s;e, and form Idea's of things we never &s;aw, and whereof bare matter, and out|ward form can give us no intimation.

<P>I come now unto the <HI>Third</HI> and la&s;t Head under the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and principal &s;cope of the <HI>Text,</HI> which is,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>THAT thou mu&s;t remember Him NOW, in the days of thy YOUTH. Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy Youth.</HI> Now <HI>in&s;tantly,</HI> now in Youth <HI>eminently</HI> and more e&s;pecially; Begin now; do not delay, <HI>defer</HI> or put off, till &s;ome uncertain hereafter, and particularly not to <HI>Old Age, the Evil days,</HI> which the <HI>Text</HI> &s;peaks of afterward.</P>
<P>THE Words do not mean to <HI>limit</HI> the Remem|brance of GOD to our Youthful days only: nor to <HI>allow</HI> us to forget him in riper Age or Old Age; or <HI>if we have forgotten</HI> God in our Youth we may not think that the <HI>Text</HI> does not con|cern us: It is the perpetual duty of <HI>Man in every Age</HI> of his life to remember his <HI>Creator,</HI> and it is as much incumbent on him in <HI>Old Age</HI> as in our Early Life: but the meaning of the
<PB N="21" REF="002102_0022_0FBB8057E6AD8510"><HI>Text</HI> is, that <HI>Youth</HI> is the time to begin this duty in, and that it is of great importance to the whole Life that God be remember'd then. <HI>Remember thy Creator NOW</HI> whether thou be Young or Old, but e&s;pecially if thou be YOUNG begin now to do it.</P>
<P N="1">1. FIRST then let me &s;ay, We mu&s;t remem|ber GOD our MAKER <HI>now, whether we be Young or Old;</HI> whether we have remembred or forgot him in days pa&s;t; yet in&s;tantly and for all times to come let us pre&s;erve a devout remem|brance of him. <HI>Now</HI> &s;peaks the pre&s;ent time, immediately: and al&s;o from henceforth, al|ways hereafter, thro' all our future days. Time is in a con&s;tant cour&s;e and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; <HI>Now</HI> is gone in the breath wherein it is uttered; and yet <HI>Now</HI> is ever pre&s;ent with us, and ever pa&s;&s;ing away. It ever continues the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>NOW is a little Image of Eternity;</HI> it is the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, ever exi&s;ting and ever the &s;ame. When GOD, the ETERNAL, pleas'd to make known him&s;elf to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as a Man is known by his Name, he &s;aid, Exod. 3.14. <HI>I AM that is my Name.</HI> Truly if we would know the mea&s;ure of our life and days, what it is, this &s;hort word <HI>Now,</HI> importing the in|&s;tant moment of our pa&s;&s;ing life is <HI>all</HI> that is ours. God exi&s;ts in an <HI>Eternal Now; without beginning of days or end of time;</HI> We exi&s;t in <HI>one in&s;tant pa&s;&s;ing moment, and our age is as nothing before Him.</HI></P>
<P>To remember our CREATOR <HI>Now</HI> takes in the whole of this pa&s;&s;ing life; which <HI>now</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="002102_0023_0FBB805961B80CB0">only is; for the days pa&s;t are irrecoverably gone; and we are not &s;ure of a breath to come. Wherefore <HI>Now,</HI> this in&s;tant, is all that we have, or are &s;ure of, to remember our <HI>Creator</HI> in: Do it now as you would at all, do it now and you do it always. Now as Young as thou art remember God thy Maker; Now do it, i. e. &s;till, as long as thou ha&s;t any Being. <HI>Now, that is to day while it is called to day;</HI> and <HI>now</HI> will be <HI>to morrow</HI> if it comes as truly as to day is. You actually forget God, if <HI>now</HI> he be not in thy mind and memory. If you &s;ay you will do it hereafter, that it will be time eno'then; this is the thing which the Precept in the <HI>Text</HI> forbids, and would warn you again&s;t: that's the &s;ure way ever to forget God. <HI>Now</HI> is the only time we have, or that God will accept; 2 Cor. 6.2. <HI>Now is the accepted time and now is the day of Salvation.</HI> P&s;al. 119.44. <HI>So &s;hall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>I clo&s;e this head with a wi&s;e and good Tho't of Dr. <HI>Hickmans;</HI> <Q>The time <HI>pa&s;t</HI> is fled and gone for ever, and leaves nothing behind it but either the comfort of having di&s;charg'd our duty, or the &s;ad remembrance of our neglects. The time <HI>to come</HI> is it &s;elf nothing; the fond imagination &amp; forlorn hope of the &s;luggard and the &s;pend-thrift. The time pa&s;t is already <HI>dead,</HI> the time to come is yet <HI>unborn;</HI> but <HI>Now</HI> is our life.</Q></P>
<P>BUT yet neither is this the immediate Scope of the <HI>Text,</HI> what that means by <HI>Now</HI> is <HI>the days of Youth:</HI> to <HI>that</HI> the Text limits it:</P>

2. MORE e&s;pecially <HI>Young People mu&s;t remem|ber their Creator now, in the days of their Youth.</HI></P>
<P>TO YOUNG PEOPLE therefore I &s;hall confine my &s;elf in the re&s;t of my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> and on them I am to pre&s;s the <HI>Duty</HI> as e&s;peci|ally incumbent on them.

<P>BUT I &s;hall only lay before the Young Per|&s;on the&s;e <HI>Three Rea&s;ons</HI> why he, is peculiarly obliged to <HI>remember his CREATOR now in the days of his Youth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE it is exceeding <HI>honorary and well plea&s;ing to GOD</HI> that he do &s;o. Now the fir&s;t End of your <HI>Being</HI> is to plea&s;e and honour your CREATOR, and to it you ought in the fir&s;t place to apply your &s;elves. This GOD <HI>requires</HI> of thee. Prov. 8.17. <HI>Seek me early.</HI> 23.36. <HI>My Son, give me thy heart.</HI> OUR SAVIOUR'S words and action were a plain declaration and a lively <HI>Emblem</HI> of the plea&s;ure he has in early Piety; When he &s;aid of <HI>little Children, Suffer them to come to me, of them is my Kingdom;</HI> and when <HI>he took them up into his arms and ble&s;&s;ed them.</HI> The LORD our GOD, requir'd the <HI>fir&s;t ripe fruits</HI> under the <HI>Law,</HI> and his <HI>Soul de&s;ires</HI> it under the <HI>Go&s;pel;</HI> And the one was but a <HI>Type</HI> and &s;hadow of the other. Under both <HI>Te&s;taments,</HI> we have many beauteous <HI>In|&s;tances,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="002102_0025_0FBB805DC95AB6E0">from righteous <HI>Abel</HI> down to gracious <HI>Timothy,</HI> of GOD's plea&s;ure in and glory from an Early Piety. The time would fail me to &s;peak of <HI>Enoch, I&s;aac, Jo&s;eph, Jo&s;hua, Samuel, David,</HI> and <HI>SOLOMON in his Glory.</HI> Who but GOD &s;hould have the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind and heart, or the fir&s;t fruits of the Life? The fir&s;t affections of a Creature made to be Religious, mu&s;t be &s;acred to GOD. It is both a high di&s;honour and inju&s;tice to the Great CREATOR, to rob him of this; and a thing very plea&s;ing to the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>ADD here the&s;e <HI>two</HI> very &s;erious Con&s;ide|tions: What abundance of <HI>Sin</HI> again&s;t GOD, and <HI>Di&s;honour</HI> to him is <HI>prevented,</HI> if we Early remember Him? and what a <HI>foundation</HI> is laid for <HI>Service</HI> and Glory to Him herein, if He &s;pare us in his World? As <HI>long</HI> as we forget Him we &s;hall be &s;inning again&s;t him; and as <HI>&s;oon</HI> as we begin &s;eriou&s;ly to remember Him we &s;hall be &s;erving and glorifying him. The <HI>Infant</HI> in Years becomes a great Sinner and a high Offender again&s;t the GOD of his Being out of who&s;e Hands he is but ju&s;t come, if he do not begin to remember his <HI>Creator:</HI> and what a <HI>Generation of Vipers</HI> are the little brood like to be that run <HI>a&s;tray as &s;oon as they born,</HI> without any check or re&s;traint upon them from the Remembrance of GOD? <HI>Gen.</HI> 8.21. On the contrary, What a World of <HI>time</HI> is &s;av'd and <HI>work</HI> done, if we begin <HI>betimes</HI> and hold <HI>on?</HI> What proficiency in Grace is the earne&s;t <HI>Youth</HI> like to make, if he &s;ets out &s;oon
<PB N="25" REF="002102_0026_0FBB805F61C30160">and keeps on, tho' he run but &s;low! The way will rid away apace, and he get a great way a head! <HI>the Child may die a hundred years old!</HI> be further on his way, and have done more for God, than a late <HI>Penitent</HI> of that Age; might &s;uch a one be &s;uppo&s;ed. He that grows in Grace while he does in <HI>Stature</HI> may in his Youth be <HI>a Man in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. IT is exceeding <HI>Profitable and beneficial to our &s;elves</HI> if we remember our Creator in the days of our Youth. Is it <HI>GOD's honour</HI> and glory that we remember Him Young? it is as much our own <HI>Intere&s;t and happine&s;s, pre&s;ent and future.</HI></P>
<P>THE Pious Youth <HI>prevents a world of evil</HI> and mi&s;chief, guilt and mi&s;ery to him&s;elf; and a <HI>world of good</HI> comes to him. If we <HI>forget</HI> GOD in our Youthful days we make &s;ad work for an after-repentance, and a &s;orrowful Remem|brance there will be of our folly and wicked|ne&s;s as long as we live. No body knows the darkne&s;s and remor&s;e, the &s;orrows &amp; angui&s;hes, the wounds and dolours of Soul that it may procure you; or which is a wor&s;e <HI>plague,</HI> what blindne&s;s and hardne&s;s, in&s;en&s;ibility and obdu|racy! Be&s;ides the Woes which the <HI>Prodigal</HI> is u&s;ually reduc'd to in Body and in worldly Cir|cum&s;tances, wherein he is made to <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s the Sins of his Youth,</HI> thro' many an <HI>evil day and month of vanity and mourning,</HI> Prov. 5.11.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, by early Piety and Re|ligion the Young Per&s;on puts him&s;elf under the care and ble&s;&s;ing of a <HI>Gracious Providence.</HI> He
<PB N="26" REF="002102_0027_0FBB8060B7E9E760">makes <HI>Jacobs</HI> Choice of GOD and <HI>Vow</HI> to Him; and GOD makes the &s;ame <HI>Covenant</HI> with him. <HI>Gen.</HI> 28.20. Like <HI>Jabez</HI> he <HI>prays,</HI> and GOD <HI>gives him his Petition.</HI> He is like <HI>a green Olive|tree in the hou&s;e of GOD, and tru&s;ts in his mercy for ever and ever,</HI> P&s;al. 52.8.</P>
<P>MORE e&s;pecially, He that remembers his CREATOR in the days of his Youth is ble&s;&s;ed on <HI>Spiritual Accounts.</HI> This is the BLESSING which he <HI>early &s;eeks and finds.</HI> He is like to ble&s;&s;ed with <HI>an Abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> as was before hinted. What a &s;piritual Mind is this like to be in mortal Fle&s;h! and what a Divine life is he like to attain in Communion with GOD? How na|tural and familiar, ea&s;y and plea&s;ant will a Godly life be rendered by U&s;e from thy Youth-up! What a Preparation will it be again&s;t the Evils and Afflictions of the pre&s;ent life; and what a pre&s;ervation from <HI>the Evil?</HI> P&s;al. 71.17, 18. What a peaceful and happy Death may well clo&s;e this comfortable life, and O <HI>the exceeding Great and Eternal weight of Glory</HI> to this happy Per&s;on! If there are <HI>Degrees</HI> of Glory in Heaven, as doubtle&s;s there be, The&s;e are like to be High therein, who beginning <HI>Young</HI> in the good ways of the LORD hold <HI>on</HI> and <HI>out</HI> to the end. The&s;e eminently <HI>have glo|rified</HI> CHRIST <HI>on Earth, and he will glorify them with him&s;elf</HI> for ever. The&s;e are the <HI>Rich</HI> in Grace, and <HI>ripe</HI> for Glory. The&s;e &s;hall have <HI>an Entrance admini&s;tred abundantly</HI> into the <HI>Joy</HI> of their LORD, and be taken near to the <HI>B &s;om
<PB N="27" REF="002102_0028_0FBB8064E7A22228">of</HI> JESUS. To what <HI>Crowns</HI> and <HI>Man&s;ions</HI> &s;hall they be taken who by a <HI>patient continuance in well doing have been &s;eeking after Glory Honour and Immortality!</HI> This <HI>Tribe</HI> of righteous <HI>Abel,</HI> living long in the Wor&s;hip and Service of GOD, if they come not quite up to <HI>his Crown of Martyrdom,</HI> &s;eem to come next to it.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Benefit is va&s;t</HI> to us both pre&s;ent and future. on temporal &amp; in &s;piritual re&s;pects, by <HI>remembring your CREATOR now in the days of your Youth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And la&s;tly, IT is the way to be <HI>&s;ingularly u&s;eful and ble&s;&s;ings to Others</HI> if we remember our CREATOR in the days of our Youth. We are not born for our &s;elves only, but al&s;o for the good of <HI>others:</HI> and <HI>as &s;oon</HI> as may be we &s;hould be benefitting others; and <HI>how &s;oon</HI> can GOD make us beneficial to others? His Grace in us betimes, makes us u&s;eful betimes.</P>
<P>To be particular:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHAT comforts and ble&s;&s;ings will this ren|der you to your Parents and gracious Friends?</HI> if they &s;ee you remember your CREATOR Now in the days of your Youth. How <HI>lovely</HI> will it render you in their eyes, and how much their <HI>Joy?</HI> Such Children are their Parents <HI>Crown,</HI> and &s;uch Youths are the <HI>Staff</HI> of their Old Age, and happy the <HI>Father</HI> in &s;uch a Son, happy the <HI>Mother</HI> in &s;uch a Dau'ter.</P>
<P>SOLOMON tells us, and it is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of his <HI>Proverbs</HI> &s;trictly &s;o called; Prov. 10.1. <HI>A wi&s;e Son maketh a glad Father.</HI> And again he &s;ays to the Young Man, 23.15. <HI>My Son, if thine
<PB N="28" REF="002102_0029_0FBB8066D6A60CC8">heart be wi&s;e, my heart &s;hall rejoyce, even mine; yea my reins &s;hall rejoyce when thy lips &s;peak right things.</HI> Children know not what joy they would give their Parents by Early Piety.</P>
<P>EVEN Parents that are not Converted to GOD them&s;elves are glad to &s;ee their Chil|dren Pious and Religious; yea it may be the means of their Conver&s;ion, and &s;ometimes has been. But if a Parent be gracious it both de|lights and edifies him to &s;ee the Grace of God in his Child; it enlarges his heart in thank|fulne&s;s to God as well as in love to his Child. Prov. 23.24. <HI>The father of the righteous &s;hall greatly rejoyce, and he that begetteth a wi&s;e child &s;hall have joy of him; thy father and thy mother &s;hall be glad, and &s;he that bare thee &s;hall rejoyce.</HI> Therefore <HI>remember thy Creator now,</HI> that while you are in the hou&s;e of your Parents, they may have comfort in you, and when you are for your &s;elves their comfort in you may in|crea&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Child that remembers his CREATOR, and he that does it in his <HI>Youth, is like to be a ble&s;&s;ing to his Brethren and Si&s;ters, while he grows up with them and afterward;</HI> a ble&s;&s;ing al&s;o <HI>to the Servants of the Family,</HI> to the <HI>play-mates</HI> of his Childhood, and the <HI>Companions</HI> of his Youth. Such a Child may be the <HI>Salt</HI> of the Family, and &s;ea&s;on the whole hou&s;e. <HI>A little leven le|veneth the whole lump.</HI> If in your Childhood and Youth you remember your Creator you will <HI>pray</HI> to him, and not only Pray for your &s;elves but for your <HI>Parents,</HI> and <HI>Brothers</HI> and
<PB N="29" REF="002102_0030_0FBB8068622BECC0"><HI>Si&s;ters,</HI> and for the <HI>Servants</HI> of the Hou&s;e; and who knows <HI>what</HI> your Prayers may do for them, and for your &s;elves? And the Praying Child or Youth often leads <HI>others</HI> to Prayer, puts them on Praying, and it may be Prays <HI>with</HI> them, as well as <HI>for</HI> them. A pious Child in a Family is like to put others in it on Secret Prayer, either by Word or by his Example. It reproves others that are carele&s;s, tho'tle&s;s and prayerle&s;s; to &s;ee one that is younger tho'tful and concerned about his Soul, and <HI>retiring</HI> to Pray. Yea how often have <HI>elder</HI> Per&s;ons been in&s;tructed and corrected by the knowledge and good behaviour of Young Chil|dren. "This Child reproves me, and teaches me, may many a grown Per&s;on &s;ay; &s;eems to under&s;tand and know more than I do, and to be better than I am. And 'tis an admonition u&s;ually well taken, when it comes in our way. Now let our Young People be de&s;irous thus to benefit all about them from their Early days, that others may already ble&s;s GOD for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF you remember your CREATOR now in the days of your Youth, <HI>it will be the way to make you Ble&s;&s;ings in the FAMILIES into which the Providence of God may bring you, and in the RELATIONS wherein you &s;hall hereafter &s;tand.</HI> When the Young Man, or the Maiden, goes into <HI>Service</HI> here or there, happy may the Hou&s;e be where into they come. They are like to be the faithful, diligent, prudent, hum|ble Servants; like the devout <HI>Eliezer</HI> the Ser|vant of <HI>Abraham,</HI> in whom the heart of his
<PB N="30" REF="002102_0031_0FBB806A0EB63858">Ma&s;ter could &s;afely tru&s;t, and who religiou&s;ly di&s;charg'd every tru&s;t committed to him. A <HI>Servant</HI> that was a <HI>Son</HI> to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and a kind of <HI>Father</HI> to <HI>I&s;aac.</HI> A Servant that carried every Affair wherein he was concerned unto GOD, and did every thing as to the <HI>LORD and not to Man,</HI> doing the Will of God and of his Ma&s;ter <HI>from the heart.</HI> A good Servant is a rich ble&s;&s;ing to a Family. Such a one was <HI>Jacob</HI> in the hou&s;e of <HI>Laban,</HI> if he may be called a Servant there, and what a ble&s;&s;ing did he <HI>bring</HI> with him, as well as <HI>carry</HI> away with him, out of his <HI>Uncles Flocks?</HI> Such a Servant was <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in the <HI>Egyptians</HI> hou&s;e, prudent and diligent and fearing GOD; and GOD ble&s;s'd the <HI>hou&s;e</HI> or the <HI>pri&s;on</HI> where-ever he came, and made all that he did to pro&s;per. Nay what a ble&s;&s;ing to <HI>Naaman</HI> and his hou&s;e was the poor <HI>girl of I&s;rael,</HI> that <HI>remember'd</HI> and &s;pake of the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the Land of her Captivity? Thus 'tis the way to make the Young Per&s;on a Ble&s;&s;ing in the Family that receives him, if <HI>he remember his Creator</HI> in his early days.</P>
<P>BUT then there are other and <HI>Superiour Re|lations</HI> which the Young Per&s;on hopes in a few Years to come into, and this will make him a ble&s;&s;ing to <HI>his own</HI> Family when he comes to have one; a ble&s;&s;ing to his <HI>Con&s;ort</HI> if he mar|ries, a ble&s;&s;ing to his <HI>Children</HI> if God give him any, a ble&s;&s;ing to his <HI>Servants</HI> when he has them under him. And &s;o the <HI>Young Woman</HI> becomes a ble&s;&s;ing in the hou&s;e of her <HI>Husband,</HI> a ble&s;&s;ing to her <HI>Children and Servants,</HI> if from
<PB N="31" REF="002102_0032_0FBB806B75C1AC48">her early days &s;he be truly. Religious. Prov. 31.28. <HI>Her Children ri&s;e up and call her ble&s;&s;ed, her husband al&s;o and he prai&s;eth her.</HI> Happy the religious <HI>pair,</HI> that thus come together in their Youth, live in holy love, walk in their hou&s;e with a perfect heart, and go hand in hand toward Heaven.</P>
<P>LET &s;uch Tho'ts as the&s;e in&s;pire and charm our Young People into a timely remembrance of their <HI>Creator,</HI> that they may <HI>live</HI> and be &s;uch <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> in one <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> Relation and in another. And now to come to our more <HI>publick</HI> Relations and Capacities,</P>
<P N="4">4. IF you remember your Creator now in the days of your Youth, <HI>it will make you Ble&s;&s;ings to the World you live in, and to the Ge|neration you are to &s;erve by the will of GOD.</HI> This it is that will make us good <HI>Neighbours,</HI> and u&s;eful to our <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Country.</HI> This is the be&s;t foundation too that we can lay for a more <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> &s;erviceablene&s;s, and the being good <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> or <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>YOUNG People that now remember their <HI>Creator,</HI> are the <HI>Earne&s;ts</HI> of the pre&s;ence and favour of GOD with the <HI>next Generation. This is the generation of them that &s;eek him,</HI> and <HI>that &s;hall be accounted of by him for a Generation,</HI> P&s;al. 22.30. They are the good <HI>tokens</HI> upon a Peo|ple, wherein GOD is <HI>&s;peaking graciou&s;ly con|cerning them for times to come.</HI> The&s;e <HI>will ari&s;e and declare unto their Children, the works and prai&s;es of the LORD; that they too may &s;et their hope in GOD and keep his commandments,</HI> P&s;al.
<PB N="32" REF="002102_0033_0FBB806CC7017CD0">87.7. Then Religion is not like to <HI>die</HI> with the pious of <HI>this</HI> Generation, nor to be buried in their Graves; but to &s;urvive when the Gra|cious that now live are gathered to their Fa|thers.</P>
<P>IN three re&s;pects you will be like to be great Ble&s;&s;ings in your day and place, if now you remember your CREATOR in the days of your Youth; by your <HI>Prayers,</HI> by your <HI>Exam|ple,</HI> and by your <HI>knowledge</HI> and <HI>wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>I will add &s;ome other <HI>Motives</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ide|rations,</HI> further to Excite our Young People to the <HI>Duty</HI> before us.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>NOW is your learning time,</HI> and what &s;hould you <HI>fir&s;t</HI> learn but the things of GOD, and what has regard to your Supreme Good and Everla&s;ting Welfare? In Childhood you are put to <HI>School,</HI> in the beginning of your Youth you are put to <HI>Trades;</HI> what is there to be done for you in the&s;e early Years but to <HI>in&s;truct</HI> you? what bu&s;ine&s;s have you to do but to <HI>learn?</HI> what you now learn you are like to <HI>retain;</HI> if you don't learn now 'twill be <HI>hard</HI> to do it hereafter. But of all things that you have to learn there is nothing needful in compari&s;on with this, the things of Religion, the things of your Everla&s;ting Peace and Sal|vation. This only makes you for ever. Other things may <HI>&s;erve you here,</HI> that <HI>&s;aves</HI> you <HI>for ever.</HI> Other things &s;erve you for the <HI>Body,</HI> this is &s;aving to the immortal <HI>Soul.</HI> By other knowledge you may be u&s;eful to others in <HI>tem|poral</HI> re&s;pects, by this thou may'&s;t he &s;ervicea|ble
<PB N="33" REF="002102_0034_0FBB806E668BCC40">to their <HI>Everla&s;ting Salvation.</HI> Therefore learn <HI>this</HI> in the days of thy Youth, <HI>thy learning time;</HI> learn to fear and &s;erve God.</P>
<P N="2">2. YOUTH <HI>is thy beautiful, thy lovely and acceptable time.</HI> This is the prime and bloom, the flower, vigour and &s;trength of thy life. <HI>This Beginning and Excellency and Fir&s;t-born</HI> of thy life devote to God.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>NOW</HI> O Young People is <HI>your chu&s;ing time,</HI> and commonly your <HI>fixing time;</HI> and as you fix now it is like to la&s;t. Now you commonly chu&s;e your <HI>Trade;</HI> betake your &s;elves to your bu&s;ine&s;s for life, &s;how what you incline to, and how you intend to be imploy'd all your days. Now you chu&s;e your <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> and your Education or Occupation. And now you di&s;|po&s;e of your &s;elf in <HI>Marriage</HI> ordinarily, place your <HI>Affections,</HI> give away your hearts, look out for &s;ome <HI>Companion</HI> of life, who&s;e to be as long as you live. And is this indeed the work of your Youth? and is it not time for you to fix too in your <HI>General Calling,</HI> your <HI>Heavenly</HI> Calling? <HI>your Fathers bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> and the <HI>working out your own Salvation?</HI> Where now is the <HI>love</HI> of an <HI>E&s;pou&s;al</HI> toward GOD? who claims you in the &s;tyle and relation of a <HI>Husband,</HI> as well as of a Father and Ma&s;ter! You are to chu&s;e for your <HI>life,</HI> and to di&s;po&s;e of your &s;elf probably for <HI>Eternity! who&s;e</HI> and <HI>where</HI> and <HI>what</HI> you will be! how dreadful is the tho't! wilt thou now forget thy SAVIOUR and thy <HI>Soul?</HI> de&s;pi&s;e Heaven and Eternal Glory? and ca&s;t away thy &s;elf into the arms of the <HI>World,</HI> the

<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider, YOU that are Young, <HI>Now may be your only Sea&s;on.</HI> Young as you are you may <HI>die</HI> to day or to morrow. You may <HI>die in Youth, and your life be among the unclean,</HI> your lot with them for ever, your Eternity among the <HI>unclean Spirits</HI> of Hell. You are not <HI>&s;ure</HI> of living to be Old, tho' you are ready to <HI>hope</HI> for it, and to <HI>promi&s;e</HI> your &s;elf &s;ome hereafter to repent &amp; remember God in. God may cut &s;hort, cut off the thred of your life, and in a moment &s;end you down into the place of torments.</P>
<P N="5">5. WON'T you remember your <HI>CREATOR now? it may be He will never give you of his Grace to do it hereafter.</HI> Ju&s;tly may he deny it to you when you are Older. Nay you will be le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to remember Him then. Cu&s;tom in Sin will harden you in it; you harden your &s;elves from his fear while you live without the remembrance of him. Satan and lu&s;t blind the mind and fear the Con&s;cience by their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. They u&s;ually hold the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion we give them in our Youth. How few are Converted in riper years! Youth is the time of &s;aving Impre&s;&s;ions for the mo&s;t part. <HI>Of &s;uch is the Kingdom of Hea|ven,</HI> of &s;uch on whom God begins to work while they are Young.</P>

6. AND La&s;tly, Let Young People con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly how <HI>they are obliged and engaged, priviledged and advantaged above others, to remember their Creator now.</HI> You are not the Children of <HI>Heathen,</HI> nor born in the regions of darkne&s;s, where Men are without the knowledge of the <HI>true GOD,</HI> the Great <HI>Creator</HI> of all things. You are not of the Families of the Nations where God is unknown and forgotten. You are not Educated in utter ignorance as they are, nor led into their barbarous Doctrines and wor&s;hip of <HI>Idols</HI> and of Devils. GOD has given you his Word, the <HI>Holy Scripture,</HI> and made Him&s;elf known to you in it. The Son of GOD Him&s;elf has come to give you an un|der&s;tanding, and to reveal GOD unto you, his Will and the way of a Sinners Salvation. You are informed from the Holy Word, <HI>who</HI> made you, and <HI>how</HI> you were made holy and happy; and <HI>how</HI> you come to be born a Sinner, and <HI>what</HI> GOD has done to &s;ave you, and <HI>what</HI> you mu&s;t do to be &s;aved. GOD has taken you under the wing of his <HI>Covenant,</HI> and into a Vi&s;ible Covenant and Church &s;tate from the day of your birth, it may be; and directed you to be &s;eparated and mark'd as one of his Flock. Your Parents have privately and publickly dedicated you to Him, as your GOD; avouch'd Him to be &s;o, engag'd you to be the LORD's, vow'd you to Him with much Solemnity, before you were born &amp; &s;ince.

<P>THUS, and much more our Children and Young People are obliged and engaged and advantaged to <HI>remember their Creator;</HI> and if they do it not they are pre&s;umptuous and rebellious again&s;t GOD and their Parents; they are unna|tural and prophane, and it were better for them (dying &s;o) that they had been born of Heathens and never known GOD, or <HI>been known of Him.</HI></P>
