<P>THIS Speech would never have been &s;ent to the Pre&s;s, if it had not been earne&s;tly and importu|nately de&s;ired, by a large Number of the Members of the Hou&s;e, who thought that it might be of real Service, in allaying &s;ome Animo&s;ity, that, in their Opinion, had ari&s;en from a Mi&s;under&s;tanding of the Nature of the Ca&s;e.

<HEAD>SPEECH IN The General A&s;&s;embly <HI>OF SOUTH-CAROLINA.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. SPEAKER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am much concerned, le&s;t an unfavourable con&s;truction &s;hould be put upon any word that may fall from me in the cour&s;e of this de|bate, as reflecting upon the re&s;pectable members of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> I wi&s;h, Sir, to be
<PB N="4" REF="015612_0004_0F99DA4974E95D48">under&s;tood as bearing the gentlemen of that Church, a very high re&s;pect. None that now exi&s;t have been the authors of that which we com|plain of: With the genero&s;ity of &s;entiment, that now prevails; with the &s;ame enlightened minds, I am per&s;uaded they never would have been the authors.</P>
<P>I di&s;&s;ent from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> it is true, but, I tru&s;t, it is upon the mo&s;t liberal grounds: When I oppo&s;e its e&s;tabli&s;hment, I do not mean to oppo&s;e the Church it&s;elf. I would equally oppo&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any other, though I admired its con&s;titution ever &s;o much. I firmly believe that this Petition ari&s;es from an unextingui&s;hable love to the free and equal rights of mankind, and not from a di&s;like to one deno|mination of Chri&s;tians, more than another. And Sir! while a love to Freedom and Equality is the grand &s;entiment that in&s;pires all ranks of men, in this great conte&s;t; while you &s;eel an un|conquerable Spirit of Freedom, animating you to all the&s;e mea&s;ures; how can you find in your heart to blame tho&s;e who ri&s;que their all, and &s;tand with you in the foremo&s;t rank of zeal and danger, if they &s;hould only de&s;ire to &s;e|cure to them&s;elves and children, the &s;ame privi|leges that you enjoy? You mu&s;t pardon them, it, &s;en&s;ible of the injuries that have been done them in times pa&s;t, while we mutually groaned under a foreign yoke, and anxious for the com|plete Freedom and Happine&s;s of their po&s;terity,
<PB N="5" REF="015612_0005_0F99DA4A302368F8">they &s;hould improve the important moment of forming a con&s;titution for this mo&s;t righteous purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And, now Sir! I beg leave to offer a few of tho&s;e rea&s;ons which induce me to oppo&s;e the re|ligious e&s;tabli&s;hment of any one denomination of Chri&s;tians in this State, under our new con|&s;titution.</P>
<P N="1">1. My fir&s;t, and mo&s;t capital rea&s;on, again&s;t all religious e&s;tabli&s;hments is, that <HI>they are an infringement of Religious Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>Religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, as far as they ope|rate, do interfere with the rights of private judg|ment and con&s;cience: In effect, they amount to nothing le&s;s, than the legi&s;lature's taking the con|&s;ciences of men into their own hands, and taxing them at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>We contend, that no legi&s;lature under Heaven, has a right to interfere with the judgment and con&s;cience of men, in religious matters, if their opinions and practices do not injure the State. The rights of con&s;cience, are now too generally under&s;tood, to make it needful to take much pains to convince mankind, that they appertain to an higher tribunal, and that the objects of hu|man legi&s;lation, are quite of a different nature. The State may give countenance to religion, by defending and protecting all denominations of Chri&s;tians, who are inoffen&s;ive and u&s;eful. The
<PB N="6" REF="015612_0006_0F99DA4B00026160">State may enact good laws for the puni&s;hment of vice. and the encouragent of virtue. The State may do any thing for the &s;upport of religion, without partiality to particular &s;ocieties, or im|po&s;ition upon the rights of private judgment. But when the legi&s;lative authority of the state, &s;ets it&s;elf up as a judge in church controver&s;ies, and proceeds by law, to declare <HI>this</HI> &s;y&s;tem of opini|ons right, and <HI>that</HI> wrong; when it proceeds to lay hard&s;hips upon the profe&s;&s;ors of the one, while it lavi&s;hes its bounties on the other, and that while both are equally u&s;eful and inoffen&s;ive &mdash; I &s;ay, in this, it not only mi&s;takes the pro|per objects of legi&s;lation, but is chargeable with manife&s;t inju&s;tice. No legi&s;lature upon earth, has a right to do &s;uch a thing: Nay, we contend, that &s;uch a right cannot po&s;&s;ibly be communi|cated to them. I can communicate to my re|pre&s;entative, a power to di&s;po&s;e of part of my property, for the &s;ecurity of the remaining part: I may give him a right to re&s;ign a part of my per&s;onal liberty to the obligation of good laws, as a means of pre&s;erving the re&s;t,&mdash;but, can|not, &mdash;I &s;ay it is out of my power, to commu|nicate to any man on earth, a right to di&s;po&s;e of my con&s;cience, and to lay down for me what I &s;hall believe and practice in religious matters. Our judgment and practice in religious matters, is not like our pur&s;e; we cannot re&s;ign them to any man of &s;et of men on earth; and therefore, no man or &s;et of men on earth, either has or can have, a right to bind us in religious matters. The rights of con&s;cience are unnalienable, and therefore,
<PB N="7" REF="015612_0007_0F99DA4C1B45A4C8">all laws to bind it, are, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> null and void. Every attempt of this kind is tyrany, let it be made by whatever body of men, and in whatever age: &mdash; Of all tyrany, religious tyrany is the wor&s;t, and men of true &s;entiment, will &s;corn ci|vil, where they cannot enjoy Religious Liberty.</P>
<P>And, now Sir! permit me to take a &s;hort view of religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, and &s;ee, whether they do not more or le&s;s, bear hard upon the rights of private judgment, and partake, in greater or &s;maller degrees, of this wor&s;t of tyrany.</P>
<P>On all hands it will be acknowledged, that tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments are of this nature, which lay heavy penalties upon tho&s;e who refu&s;e to conform to them. Can you form an idea of more horrid cruelty exercired upon the rights of con&s;cience, than that which impo&s;es fines, impri&s;onment and death, upon tho&s;e who pre&s;ume to differ from the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion? You, Sir! look back with horror upon the hi&s;tory of &s;uch &s;avage cruelty, &mdash; the more crued, as it has ever been exerci&s;ed under the colour of law.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame nature, though differing &s;ome|what in the degree of their cruelty, are tho&s;e e&s;|tabli&s;hments, which incapacitate good &s;ubjects; who differ from the &s;peculative opinions of the State. Judgment and con&s;cience, in the&s;e mat|ters, is, or <HI>ought to be,</HI> as independent of our will, as our height or colour: They are formed
<PB N="8" REF="015612_0008_0F99DA4CA312B2E0">by the circum&s;tances of the time in which we live, by the manner of our education, by the ca|pacity of our mind, and the degree of evidence. Would not that prince be e&s;teemed a cruel tyrant, who &s;hould ordain, that every man of &s;ix feet high, and of a &s;andy complexion, &s;hould be ex|cluded from the rights of citizens? An a&s;&s;embly of two hundred &s;enators, who could ordain, that good citizens &s;hould be deprived, on account of their inoffen&s;ive opinions, would be two hundred times as cruel.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next kind of e&s;tabli&s;hment that we meet with, is, that which now obtains in this State. I &s;hall &s;peak cautiou&s;ly of it, but I &s;hall take the liberty to &s;peak freely, and &s;hall only mention facts.</P>
<P>Its chief characteri&s;ticks are, that it makes a legal di&s;tinction between people of different deno|minations, equally inoffen&s;ive; it taxes all de|nominations for the &s;upport of the religion of one; it only tolerates tho&s;e that diffent from it, while it deprives them of &s;undry privileges which the people of the e&s;tabli&s;hment enjoy.</P>
<P>I &s;ay it makes a legal and odious di&s;tinction between &s;ubjects equally good. The law knows and acknowledges the &s;ociety of the one, as a Chri&s;tian Church; the law knows not the other Churches. The law knows the Clergy of the one, as mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel; The law knows
<PB N="9" REF="015612_0009_0F99DA4F315322E0">not the Clergy of the other Churches, nor will it give them a licence to marry their own people. Under this reputedly free government, licences for marriage are even now refu&s;ed by the Ordi|nary, to any but the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy. The law makes provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of one Church,&mdash;it makes no provi&s;ion for the others. The law builds &s;uperb Churches for the one,&mdash; it leaves the others to build their own Churches. the law, by incorporating the one Church, ena|bles it to hold e&s;tates, and to &s;ue for rights; the law does not enable the others to hold any reli|gious property, not even the pi&s;tances which are be&s;towed by the hand of charity for their &s;up|port. No diffenting Church can hold or &s;ue for their own property at common law. They are obliged therefore to depo&s;it it in the Hands of Tru&s;tees, to be held by them as their own private property, and to lie at their mercy. The con&s;e|quence of this is, that too often their funds for the &s;upport of religious wor&s;hip, get into bad hands, and become either alienated from their proper u&s;e, or mu&s;t be recovered at the expence of a &s;uit in chancery.</P>
<P>The&s;e are important di&s;tinctions indeed, but the&s;e are not all. The law ve&s;ts the officers of the Church of England with power to tax not only her own people, but all other denomina|tions within the bounds of each re&s;pective pari&s;h, for the &s;upport of the poor: an enormous pow|er! which ought to be ve&s;ted in no one denomi|nation
<PB N="10" REF="015612_0010_0F99DA4F6B6C2E30">more than another. Greater di&s;tinctions &s;till! where there are pari&s;hes the law throws the whole management of elections, that mo&s;t ine&s;ti|mable of all the rights of freemen, into the hands of Church officers exclu&s;ively.</P>
<P>And why all this inequality? Why does the law thus favour one, and bear hard upon every other denomination of Chri&s;tians? The rea&s;on is only to be found in the &s;pirit of the times when this unequal e&s;tabli&s;hment was framed, and in the Machiavelian policy of the Briti&s;h government; which ought not any longer to take place in this country.</P>
<P>But that which &s;hews much of the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, is the tax which it makes all other denominations pay to the &s;upport of the religion of one. It puts its hand into the pocket of nine denominations, all equally pretending to the merit of good &s;ubjects and citizens, to be&s;tow upon one and &s;upport its dignity.</P>
<P>Sir! is this con&s;i&s;tent with our fir&s;t notions of ju&s;tice and equality? And here, it matters not whether the religious tax is equally levied upon the people at large, or whether it is paid by a general duty. The trea&s;ury is the equal proper|ty of all denominations in the State, and if it
<PB N="11" REF="015612_0011_0F99DA54B9D6A018">comes out of the trea&s;ury, it comes in effect out of their pocket.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The only difference is, that in the one ca&s;e the impo&s;ition would be &s;o open, that the mo&s;t ignorant would know and feel it; in the other it is more &s;ly and concealed from the vulgar eye. We admire the policy of this mea&s;ure more than its ju&s;tice. But it ought to be known, that by low, the moment the trea&s;ury cea&s;es to pay the clergy, the inhabitants are to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for their &s;upport.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;ums advanced by the trea&s;ury, for the &s;upport of the Church of England, within the &s;pace of the la&s;t ten years preceding the 31&s;t of December 1775, amount to 164, 027 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 16 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 3 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> The expence of the year 1772 only, was 18, 031 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 11 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 1 <ABBR><HI>d</HI></ABBR> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have not been able to &s;atisfy my&s;elf in computing the ex|peres of the e&s;tabli&s;hment from its beginning to the pre&s;ent day, but am convineed from a &s;pecimen of thirty years, that it would hardly be credited.</NOTE> The religious e&s;tate, now in the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Church of England, drawn more or le&s;s from the pur&s;es of all deno minations by law, would probably &s;ell for three hundred and thirty thou&s;and pounds<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">This computation was made at a low rate, perhaps too low. The Author would be glad to be corrected in his E&s;timate, by any abler hand, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of better materials. It is &s;aid, that a great part of this e&s;tate came by private benefactions. I find, however, the &s;um of 33, 656 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> given from the trea&s;ury to the Church of St. Michael, in Charies-Town, before the end of 1758 of which 3500 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> is expre&s;sly for the &s;teeple. The whole of the tran&s;ient duties, and an heavy duty on all rum and brandy, was given to St. Philip's for &s;everal years.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, if you &s;uppo&s;e that Di&s;&s;enters have al|ways made more than one half of this govern|ment,
<PB N="12" REF="015612_0012_0F99DA571DEA89F0"><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This has u&s;ually been allowed to be the &s;tate of the ca&s;e; at pre&s;ent I believe it is on all hands agreed, that they are a great majority.</NOTE> &mdash; the &s;um that has been actually taken out of their pockets for the &s;upport of a Church with which they did not wor&s;hip, mu&s;t amount to more than 82013 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> within the ten years afore&s;aid; and a very large &s;um of their proper|ty, in globes, par&s;onages and Churches, lies in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and improvement of the Church of England. <HI>[Were we to compute the lawful inter|est of all, and the u&s;ual rent of the glebes, &amp;c. from the time when they were &s;everally granted and ap|propriated, I dont know how far it would &s;well the &s;um.]</HI></P>
<P>But if the di&s;&s;enters do make a great majority of the inhabitants, the argument is &s;till &s;tronger, and the impropriety of obliging the pur&s;e of the <HI>major</HI> to &s;uit it&s;elf to the con&s;ciences of the <HI>minor,</HI> can't fail to weigh with every candid mind. The inequality of the religious burden, is the more evident, when you con&s;ider, that the number of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Churches in this State is only twenty and many of them very &s;mall, whereas the number of formed differenting congregations, the generality of which are much larger than tho&s;e of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, is at lea&s;t &s;eventy-nine, as ap|pears from a &s;chedule now in my hand.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Quakers and &s;undry others of which I had not then heard, were not put into that li&s;t; I think there are ninety.</NOTE> Still more unequal it appears, when you take into
<PB N="13" REF="015612_0013_0F99DA5854DF3748">computation the large &s;ums which di&s;&s;enters do actually pay over and above their &s;hare of expence to the Church of England, for the &s;upport of their own wor&s;hip. From the be&s;t intelligence that I can obtain, they have made provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of their own wor&s;hip, and would actually pay the &s;um of 40,000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> annually, could they be furni&s;hed with Clergy. But the defici|ency of go&s;pel mini&s;ters reduces the &s;um very con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>Sir! you may &s;ay, that the doors of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Church are open equally to all denomi|nations, and that all may equally enjoy the bene|fit of it. I have heard of &s;uch an argument.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides that it is notorious, that what the public has paid for, in &s;ome in&s;tances has been converted into private property, and become the real e&s;tate of individuals,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pews in St. Philip's and St. Michael's Churches are now private property, and &s;ell from twelve hundred to nineteen hun|dred and fifty Pounds; what they &s;ell for in St. George's I have not heard.</NOTE> it would here be ex|tremely natural to ask, how a rational Di&s;&s;enter can enjoy the benefit of the e&s;tabli&s;hment? The only an&s;wer that I can give to &s;uch a que&s;tion is a very &s;hort one, <HI>He mu&s;t do it at the expence of his own private judgment and con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P><Q>But Di&s;&s;enters are tolerated; there is a free toleration: Does any man impo&s;e upon them?
<PB N="14" REF="015612_0014_0F99DA586D3F5408">who prevents their wor&s;hipping as they plea&s;e?</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer. In this re&s;pect they &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing with the Jews. No body mole&s;ts them. But would it, Sir, content our brethren of the Church of England, to be <HI>barely tolerated?</HI> that is, <HI>not puni&s;hed</HI> for pre&s;uming to think for them&s;elves. Is a bare toleration &s;ufficient for the majority of a free State? of a free State that expects to gain its liberties by the &s;word? Would not a <HI>bare toleration</HI> be viewed by our brethren with infinite di&s;dain; Is this equality? Sure the ju&s;tice of this hou&s;e, now unfettered by Briti&s;h violence, will not permit the continuance of &s;uch a monument of inequality.</P>
<P N="3">3. There are &s;ome who entertain an idea of keeping up the E&s;tabli&s;hment, meerly as a mat|ter of religious &s;uperiority, without taxing other denominations. But they &s;eem to forget, that every rea&s;on for which they de&s;ire the &s;uperiority by e&s;tabli&s;hment, operates as an abridgment of Religious liberty. For when a man pre&s;umes to follow his own judgment in religious matters, and refu&s;es to <HI>conform,</HI> he mu&s;t at lea&s;t &s;ubmit to this inferiority, or rather bear the reproach of the law, as not being on a level with tho&s;e that are Chri&s;tians in its e&s;teem. Still there remains inju&s;tice, and a foundation for di&s;&s;atisfaction. For Sir! let it be remembered, that there are many Di&s;&s;enters in this State, who care but little for
<PB N="15" REF="015612_0015_0F99DA592E287F70" MS="y">money that it co&s;ts them to &s;upport the Church of England. They value much more their reli|lious, their <HI>unalienable</HI> rights, than the expence. Sir! you very well know, that it was not the <HI>Three Pence on the Pound of Tea,</HI> that rou&s;ed all the virtue of America. It is our birth-right that we prize. It is a full and undimini&s;hed freedom in the exerci&s;e of our own judgment, in all reli|gious matters, that we value and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>And for a <HI>meer empty name,</HI> without profit,&mdash;for a meer title of pre-eminency without emolu|ment,&mdash;is it worth while to have a bone of end|le&s;s contention in the State, and to maintain the&s;e odious di&s;tinctions?</P>
<P N="4">4. There is propo&s;al Mr. Speaker, to e&s;tabli&s;h all denominations by law; and to pay them all equally.</P>
<P>This, Sir! may operate as a &s;cheme of divi|&s;ion, but in practice it mu&s;t appear equally ab|&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible. Ab&s;urd, as the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of all religions would in effect be no e&s;ta|bli&s;hment at all. It would de&s;troy the very end of an e&s;tabli&s;hment, by reducing things ju&s;t to the &s;ame &s;tate they would be in without it, with this di&s;advantage, that large bodies of men who could not obtain Church officers, might be oppre&s;&s;ed, by being obliged to pay for that which they received no benefit from. But it would be found impracticable, as people of different &s;enti|ments
<PB N="16" REF="015612_0016_0F99DA5A19DF2758">live intermingled, and there could be no po&s;&s;ible di&s;tinction of pari&s;hes, &s;o as to accommo|date different denominations. But if the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment mu&s;t from time to time conform it&s;elf to the prevailing party in each pari&s;h or di&s;trict, there would not only be the &s;ame ground for complaint that there now is, but it would prove the means of everla&s;ting &s;trife. And indeed I am afraid that the expence would be found upon tryal in&s;upportable. Sir! it is impracticable in this State to e&s;tabli&s;h all denominations, and it is only thrown out to amu&s;e us. But to admit the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a few di&s;&s;enting Churches, in pre|ference to all others, as a means to make them acquie&s;ce! It is too big with inju&s;tice to procure the con&s;ent of an hone&s;t man. Let us all have equal privileges or nothing. EQUALITY OR NOTHING! ought to be our motto.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, every plan of e&s;tabli&s;hment,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author had a reference in this po&s;ition, and in all others of this nature, to an e&s;tabli&s;hment of Pari&s;hes, with legal boun|daries, and tho&s;e &s;upported out of the public trea&s;ury. He has the plea&s;ure to find, that a general e&s;tabli&s;hment, or rather incor|poration of all denominations is now thought of, and likely to be adopted, which while it makes all parties happy, is not liable to the above objections.

<P>If the&s;e arguments have failed to weigh at other times, they ought now to have amazing weight. While you are contending for the rights of mankind with one of the greate&s;t powers up|on earth, will you leave your own Con&s;titution marked with inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, and that in the mo&s;t important of all re&s;pects that ever mor|tals contended for? What are all the Liberties for which we dare to grapple with Great-Britain, when compared with our religious Liberties? Can you imagine, that the numerous Di&s;&s;enters who venture their all in &s;upport of American Freedom, would be fond of &s;hedding their blood in this cau&s;e if they did not with confidence ex|pect, that they &s;hould have ju&s;tice done them, and that they &s;hould &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing with their brethren? Can you imagine that a re|fu&s;al of ju&s;tice would not damp their ardour, if not utterly di&s;arm them? Do they ask any more than what they have an ab&s;olute and indefea&s;ible right to enjoy? Sir! the&s;e are rights which they cannot po&s;&s;ibly relinqui&s;h. Their claim is found|ed in eternal ju&s;tice, and this &s;tands confe&s;&s;ed by their mo&s;t violent oppo&s;ers. They mu&s;t pay an equal &s;hare of that tax which independency will

<P>But Sir! in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the claims of good policy join tho&s;e of common and confe&s;&s;ed ju&s;tice. Religious e&s;tabli&s;hments di&s;courage the opulence and cramp the growth of a free State. Every fetter, whether religious or civil, deters people from &s;ettling in a new country.

That State in America which adopts the free&s;t and mo&s;t liberal plan will be the mo&s;t oppulent and power|ful, and will well de&s;erve it. Sir! as a narrowne&s;s in the&s;e matters is the di&s;grace of the human mind, &s;o is it the di&s;grace of any &s;y&s;tem of laws whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="015612_0019_0F99DA63E0A187E8">
I could wi&s;h to draw the attention of the Hou&s;e to another important motive,&mdash;that is, the future peace and happine&s;s of this State. Grant this pe|tition, and the foundation of religious di&s;cord is eternally removed. It is inequality that excites jealou&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfaction. Make your laws partial towards people of any one &s;et of opinions, &s;uppo&s;e it only in philo&s;ophy, and you entail immortal &s;tri&s;e and debate upon your children.

<P>Where the people have a full voice in legi&s;la|tion, the ca&s;e is va&s;tly different from what it has been in times pa&s;t, while royal violence &s;tood ready to &s;upport the claims of inju&s;tice. Gentle|men of the Church of England, &s;hould methinks be as much concerned to obtain the prayer of this petition as any others. The cour&s;e of things is very uncertain.

This is the only &s;ecurity of the Church of England, as well as of other Churches. That Church has long had the advantage; &s;he has reaped uncon|trouled, the emoluments of the State; &s;he has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the abridgment of the equal privi|leges of others; &s;he has fluori&s;hed by aid of their property. <HI>Let the time pa&s;t &s;uffice.</HI> With the new Con&s;titution, let the day of ju&s;tice dawn up|on every rank and order of men in this State. I et us bury what is pa&s;t forever. We even con|&s;ent, that the e&s;tate which &s;he has for a century pa&s;t been drawing more or le&s;s from the pur&s;es of all denominations; an e&s;tate of no le&s;s value than three hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds, re|main in her quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and be fixed there. Let her only for the future cea&s;e to demand pre|eminence. Let her freely content that others enjoy the &s;ame privileges, in every re&s;pect with her&s;elf. This is all we ask, we &s;eek no re&s;titu|tion. After the va&s;t &s;ums partially expended by the State upon one denomination, all the others ask not a farthing to be returned them. Let her be contented with her &s;uperb churches, her &s;pacious burying-grounds, her co&s;tly par|&s;onages, her humerous glebes, and other church e&s;tates, obtained in a great degree from the pub|lie pur&s;e, while not a farthing has been granted to

<P>Mr. Speaker! I know I tran&s;gre&s;s the u&s;ual bounds. Although I know it is my right,&mdash;yet I can hardly keep from asking pardon of the Hou&s;e for being tedious. But it is impo&s;&s;ible to do ju&s;tice to this great cau&s;e by confining my|&s;elf to a narrow compa&s;s. I am obliged to an|&s;wer one capital objection before I &s;it down,&mdash; and re&s;erve to my&s;elf the right of an&s;wering the arguments which are u&s;ed in favour of a continu|ance of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, in ca&s;e I find it need|ful.</P>
<P>The objection I mean is that with re&s;pect to the <HI>Time.</HI> You hear it from all quarters by tho&s;e who &s;peak in favour of the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, <Q>It is perfectly ju&s;t, that an equality of privileges &s;hould take place. None can con|tradict the ju&s;tice of the petition. If you had only delayed it to a proper time, we &s;hould have become advocates for it our&s;elves. But we have too much now upon our hands. Wait until matters are better &s;ettled, and you are &s;ure of it.</Q></P>
<P>I believe the gentlemen that I have heard &s;peak in this manner, are &s;incere as to their own inten|tions; but I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed from believing, that the zealous friends of an e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;o partial, will be of the &s;ame mind with them. I think if
<PB N="22" REF="015612_0022_0F99DA664075E798">the time is left to them, it will prove as it did in the ca&s;e of the man, the time of who&s;e ex|ecution was left to him&s;elf: It &s;o happened, that all the per&s;ua&s;ions of the executioner could ne|ver make him believe that the time pre&s;ent was proper. I remember from the hi&s;tory of the re|volution, when the Papi&s;ts were like to prove too &s;trong for the favourers of the Acce&s;&s;ion,&mdash;the Di&s;&s;enters thought it a proper time to in&s;i&s;t on &s;ome alterations in the penal laws, which, though leveled again&s;t Papi&s;ts, were &s;o artfully managed, as to take in all Di&s;&s;enters with them. The only way found to content them, was, by &s;olemnly promi&s;ing to give them relief, as &s;oon as ever the affairs of the nation would permit it. They were prayed and entreated to be &s;ilent at that time: "it would be dangerous to make any alterations&mdash;the Papi&s;ts would take advan|tage of it, and endanger the acce&s;&s;ion." <HI>They</HI> &s;imply yielded to the prayers of the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment: But, a full proof, that to <HI>po&s;tpone</HI> where the rights of ju&s;tice demand, is to <HI>betray</HI> them; a full proof of the danger of deferring to another time, what ought to be done now&mdash;I will on|ly ask any man, who knows the hi&s;tory of the na|tion &s;ince that time, whether tho&s;e promi&s;es have ever been fulfilled? Are they placed upon the equal footing that was promi&s;ed? Not that there were not found &s;ome who faithfully endeavoured to fulfill their promi&s;es,&mdash;but the majority thought it proper to ride on in the &s;ame manner, after they found them&s;elves well fixed in the &s;addle.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="015612_0023_0F99DA682E751100">
But Sir! &s;uppo&s;e the petitioners had no &s;uch in&s;tance to warn them; &s;uppo&s;e the event was not &s;o perfectly natural and to be expected. Yet let me ask any gentleman, who thinks that <HI>this is not a proper time,</HI> a few que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Is it not a fact, that we are now reviewing the Con&s;titution; that <HI>what</HI> was de&s;igned only as a <HI>protempore</HI> affair may become &s;o perfected as to be fit to &s;tand? Is it not an agreed point, that it is dangerous to have the Con&s;titution placed upon the &s;ame footing with any common law, &s;ubject to be canva&s;&s;ed every &s;e&s;&s;ions? If then, there is ever a time in which it is proper to apply for re|dre&s;s of any grievance which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to lye in the pre&s;ent frame of the State, when &s;hould that be, but when the Con&s;titution is to be re|viewed and fixed? Is there, can there be another time &s;o natural? Or &s;hould a thing in which the Liberties of the people are &s;o e&s;&s;entially concern|ed, not enter into the Con&s;titution, but be left to the precarious fate of any common law? Shall it be left to be promoted or cru&s;hed at hazard? Should not the Con&s;titution take care of the religious as well as civil Liberties of the Peo|ple? Or do you think the former of le&s;s impor|tance than the latter?</P>
<P>When the&s;e que&s;tions are properly an&s;wer|ed, I then beg leave to ask; if this matter is not now attended to, will not the Church of Eng|land be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law under the New
<PB N="24" REF="015612_0024_0F99DA68443A17A0">Con&s;titution, and become the con&s;titutional Church? If &s;o, and none will deny it, as we pre|&s;ume; then will not all the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions which have been groaned under heretofore, be con&s;titu|tional in this free State? And is this a matter of &s;mall moment to the major part of the people? And mu&s;t they &s;it &s;till out of meer compliment? Mu&s;t they compliment away their Freedom in this Manner, and not only &s;uffer, but even lend their aid, by putting their own hands to it, with the &s;anction of the people at large? It is &s;trange that gentlemen can expect it. How can we an|&s;wer our neglect to our con&s;tituents, who expect that we &s;hall make them free? How can we an|&s;wer it to our po&s;terity, who even now ought to ri&s;e in our imagination, and demand of us to leave them free? This is the natural time, and this is the only time. Things ought to be done in their proper &s;ea&s;on. And gentlemen may pre|tend what they plea&s;e,&mdash;if they are aver&s;e to grant ju&s;tice in the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on of it, &mdash; if they are un|willing to do it <HI>now,</HI> they will be more &s;o <HI>by and by.</HI> One thing I am &s;ure of, they will have le&s;s motives to engage them to do it <HI>by and by.</HI> He that is di&s;po&s;ed to do ju&s;tice, is willing to do it without delay. The old law maxim is good, <HI>to delay ju&s;tice is to deny it.</HI></P>
<P>Sir! at this time, all ranks of people more &s;en&s;ibly feel the claims of ju&s;tice, than they will hereafter. They now feel the rod of oppre&s;&s;ion: And nothing like &s;uffering to bring us to our
<PB N="25" REF="015612_0025_0F99DA68E9D76530">&s;en&s;es. They are now &s;truggling again&s;t arbitra|ry power. They can now realize the hard&s;hip. Let the&s;e times pa&s;s, and ea&s;e will naturally lull them into an inattention, to the rights of mankind.</P>
<P>That this is a proper time the example of other States confirms. Penn&s;ylvania, New Jer&s;ey, Dela|ware have led the way; Virginia, and North-Carolina are now meditating the &s;ame important &s;tep. Maryland has done it already.</P>
<P>That this is the proper time is plain, as the people are now waiting to &s;ee what they have to expect, for what it is they are to wa&s;te their trea|&s;ure and their blood? They are ready to do it cheerfully, if they may with certainty expect to be made and kept as happy as their brethren. They a&s;k no favours, they a&s;k only the common rights of mankind.</P>
<P>By &s;ome it is &s;aid to be dangerous to grant this reque&s;t at the pre&s;ent time. They own it is ju&s;t. &mdash;It ought to be. No member, &s;ay they, in the hou&s;e will deny it; but the time is dangerous.</P>
<P>But Sir! are we indeed reduced to that &s;itua|tion, that it is dangerous to do common ju&s;tice? Every man allows it to be ju&s;t: Well then, who is to be feared? Are you afraid of tho&s;e who confe&s;s the ju&s;tice of the pre&s;ent application? Acknowledging it to be ju&s;t and right, will they be apt to revolt again&s;t their own &s;entiments? Will the danger ari&s;e from the di&s;&s;enting denomi|nations
<PB N="26" REF="015612_0026_0F99DA6DF06B3F98">No; it an&s;wers the prayer of their pe|tition. Will the danger ari&s;e from the Church of England? I can't think it. It is too har&s;h an imputation upon the gentlemen of that Church. They will not endanger the State on account of that which they know and univer&s;ally allow to be ju&s;t. I cannot, I will not admit the &s;uppo&s;ition. Sir! I have the plea&s;ure of knowing too many of them to think &s;o. Many of them have &s;igned the petition. Many more have declared their &s;entiments in the mo&s;t liberal terms. There is too much Catholici&s;m and love to Liberty a|mong them. They don't de&s;ire any longer to oppre&s;s their brethren. They profe&s;s a gene|rous di&s;dain of the thing. They have property &s;ufficient to maintain their own Clergy liberally; and if the State did not take it off their hands, I believe they would do it more liberally than it is now done.</P>
<P>If the Diffenters did not apply now,&mdash;it might by and by be retorted upon them, and that with great ju&s;tice:&mdash; <Q>You have had an hand in framing the Con&s;titution, as well as we. The Church of England is the con&s;titutional Church, by your own act and deed. Why did you not make your oppo&s;ition in proper time? Why &s;o much out of &s;ea&s;on? Why en|deavour to &s;ubvert what your own hands have reared?</Q> Sir! we &s;hould be dumb; or, what is as bad, we &s;hould ju&s;tly lye under the charge
<PB N="27" REF="015612_0027_0F99DA6F67A429B0">of &s;ome &s;pecies of &s;edition. Sir! we mean to act a rational and con&s;titutional part.</P>
<P>And now Sir! it only remains to be &s;een, whether this legi&s;lative body, now, by God's goodne&s;s, free from the chains of foreign com|pul&s;ion, will rectify the errors of le&s;s happy times: whether they will ri&s;e in the annals of this important age, by &s;hewing a temper &s;uperior to all illiberality and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Will you Sir! comply with the demands of common ju&s;tice? or are you willing to li&s;ten longer to the cry of oppre&s;&s;ion? Will you make all your people equally free and happy? Do you de&s;ire to put an effectual end to all religious broils and contentions forever? Will you &s;trengthen your own hands in defence of your bleeding country? Do you wi&s;h to enrich it by an influx of healthy inhabitants from every quarter of the world? Would you &s;ecure your&s;elf from the fetters of any one denomination, with which the uncertainty of time may inundate this coun|try? Will you give to every denomination the be&s;t &s;ecurity of future religious freedom and hap|pine&s;s that the nature of the ca&s;e admits?</P>
<P>Grant them the prayer of the Petition: Grant it in &s;ub&s;tance, if not in the very expre&s;&s;ions. Let it be a foundation article in your Con&s;titu|tion, <Q>That there &s;hall be no e&s;tabli&s;hment of one religious denomination of Chri&s;tians in pre|ference

That none &s;hall be oblig|ed to pay to the &s;upport of a wor&s;hip in which they do not freely join.</Q> Yield to the mighty current of American freedom and glory, and let our State be inferiour to none on this wide continent, in the liberality of its laws, and in the happine&s;s of its people.</P>
