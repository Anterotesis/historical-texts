<HEAD>A DISCOURSE Shewing <HI>Who</HI> is a <HI>true Pa&s;tor</HI> of the CHURCH of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>_I AM fully &s;atisfy'd, that the good and well-meaning People, for who&s;e Sake this &s;hort and plain Di&s;cour&s;e is now publi&s;hed, are thoroughly convinced of the great Nece&s;&s;ity and Advantage of making U&s;e of a <HI>Spiritual Guide;</HI> and that they are always ready to con&s;ult Him, and to commit the Care of their Souls to him.</P>
<P>BUT then they may ju&s;tly ask, &mdash; WHO, WHERE is He? &mdash; <HI>Since there are &s;o many</HI> fal&s;e Teachers <HI>gone out into the World, how &s;hall I know</HI> WHICH <HI>is a</HI> true One? Among &s;o many different Pretenders to the Mini&s;try, how &s;hall I find out, WHICH <HI>are</HI> indeed <HI>the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t? Are all Apo&s;tles? Are all Prophets? Are all Teachers?</HI> 1 Cor. xii. 29. Saint <HI>Paul</HI> plainly determins, that they are not &s;o; as al&s;o, Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;aith to the Angel of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us, Thou ha&s;t tried them, which &s;ay they are Apo&s;tles, and are not, and ha&s;t found them Lyars.</HI> Rev. ii. 2. And if in the Days of Saint <HI>John</HI> the Apo&s;tle, there were fal&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="039804_0002_10161620AD13EAC0">Deceivers, who &s;aid, that they were Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and were not, much more are there &s;uch in our Days. How then &s;hall I be able to know and find them out?</P>
<P>THIS indeed is a Que&s;tion of grand Impor|tance; for Chri&s;t, who hath appointed an Or|der of Men to teach his People, <HI>hath forbidden them to heap to them&s;elves Teachers; warned us again&s;t tho&s;e who come in Sheep's Cloathing, and yet are ravenous Wolves;</HI> and a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>that if the blind lead the blind, they &s;hall both fall into the Ditch.</HI> It is to <HI>Them only</HI> who derive their Authority from Him, through the Hands of the Apo&s;tles, and their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors; and are his commi&s;&s;ioned Mini&s;ters, that He hath promi&s;ed <HI>his Pre&s;ence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the End of the World.</HI> So that if he confirms the Acts, and ble&s;&s;es the Mini&s;try of any others, it is more than He hath promi&s;ed in his holy Word.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this Que&s;tion is of &s;uch weighty Con|cern, yet the &s;olving of it has not &s;uch Difficulty in it, but that every One might of him&s;elf judge what is Right, if without Partiality, and without Hypocri&s;ie, he wou'd con&s;ider the following Parti|culars, and the Texts of Scripture annexed to them.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT none ought to act as Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t in his Church, but they who have received a Commi&s;&s;ion from him. &mdash; <HI>And Je&s;us came and &s;pake unto them, &s;aying, all Power is given unto Me in Heaven and in Earth. Go ye therefore and teach all Nations,</HI> &mdash; <HI>and lo, I am with you alway even unto the End of the World.</HI> Matth. 28.18, 19, 20. <HI>And no Man taketh this Honour unto him&s;elf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</HI> Heb. v. 4. <HI>And how &s;hall they hear without a Preacher? And how &s;hall they preach except they be &s;ent?</HI> Rom. x. 14, 15.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT none can be &s;aid to receive a divine Commi&s;&s;ion from Him, but Tho&s;e who are either
<PB N="3" REF="039804_0003_1016162BC606CD08"><HI>mediately</HI> or <HI>immediately</HI> called and appointed by him See the Texts cited under the Letter<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom</HI> x. 15. <HI>Heb.</HI> v. 4.5. <HI>Acts</HI> xiv. 23. <HI>Rev.</HI> ii. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. THAT they who pretend to an immediate Call, ought, as the Apo&s;tles did, to prove the Truth of their Mi&s;&s;ion, <HI>by working of Miracles;</HI> 'till which Time no Regard is due to their Pretences.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mark.</HI> xvi. 20. <HI>Matth.</HI> vii. 15 and ix 6 30, 31. 1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. THAT therefore the only &s;tanding regular Way <HI>of having this Honour,</HI> is the deriving of it <HI>me|diately</HI> thro' the Hands of others, from Chri&s;t him|&s;elf.</P>
<P N="5">5. THAT Chri&s;t him&s;elf, whil&s;t on Earth, had two Orders of Men under Him, the twelve Apo|&s;tles, and the Seventy; gave the Power of &s;ending, or ordaining others, to the Apo&s;tles; and to them only, and tho&s;e that &s;ucceed them, <HI>did He give the Promi&s;e of his Pre&s;ence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance unto the End of the World.</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> ix. 1. vi. 13. x. 1 and xxii. 29, 30. <HI>John</HI> xx. 21. <HI>Matth.</HI> xxviii. 16.20. <HI>Acts</HI> xxii. 17. xv. 13 and xxi. 18. <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 9.1 <HI>Tim.</HI> v. 19.22. <HI>Tit.</HI> i. 5. <HI>Rev.</HI> ii. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P N="6">6. THAT after Chri&s;t's A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven, there were &s;till <HI>three di&s;tinct Orders</HI> &s;et apart to the Mini&s;try, <HI>viz. Deacons, Presbyters,</HI> or <HI>Elders;</HI> and a &s;till higher Order, which were &s;uperiour to, and had Authority over both the&s;e, &s;uch were, be&s;ides the Apo&s;tles, <HI>Timothy, Titus,</HI> St. <HI>James,</HI> Sur-named the Ju&s;t, and the <HI>Angels of the Seven Churches. (d)</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. THAT therefore, in the Beginning of the Chri&s;tian Church, there was not a <HI>Parity,</HI> but <HI>Ine|quality,</HI> or <HI>Prelacy</HI> in the Mini&s;ters of it.</P>
<P N="8">8. THAT farther from the holy Scriptures it is evident, That the Power of Ordination was lodged in tho&s;e of the highe&s;t Order, <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and in them <HI>alone</HI> without any others being menti|oned with them.<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tim</HI> v. 22. <HI>Tit.</HI> i. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P N="9">9. THAT we have no Warrant from Scripture to conclude, that this Power was given by the Apo|&s;tles to tho&s;e of the &s;econd Order, now called Pres|byters;
<PB N="4" REF="039804_0004_1016162EA933DDE8">the chief Text upon which this Warrant is &s;uppo&s;ed to be grounded, being that of the Apo&s;tle to <HI>Timothy, Neglect not the Gift that is in thee, which was given Thee by Prophecy, with the laying on of the Hands of the Prosbytery.</HI></P>
<P>AND as Mr. <HI>Roberts</HI> judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erves, to make this Place any Thing to the Purpo&s;e, the&s;e three Things at lea&s;t mu&s;t be proved. 1. That by Presbytery, is here meant a Company of Per&s;ons. 2. That the&s;e Per&s;ons were all meer Presbyters. 3. That none but &s;uch gave <HI>Timothy</HI> his Ordination. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of which is uncertain, the <HI>&s;econd</HI> improba|ble; and the <HI>third</HI> ab&s;olutely fal&s;e.</P>
<P>AND here I cannot but take Notice of the Ig|norance or Di&s;ingenuity (not to call it a <HI>pious Fraud</HI>) of &s;ome Gentlemen in <HI>New England,</HI> in their Di&s;cour&s;e HAD (as they elegantly term it) of Pres|byterial Ordination. The De&s;ign of the Gentle|men is to prove from Scripture, that meer Presby|ters had the Power of Ordination. And thus they go to work. Page 11. <Q><HI>We can't but apprehend their [the Presbyters] Power of Ordination from Scripture Precedents.</HI> I &s;hall name two famous In&s;tances. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were &s;et apart by the Hands of ordinary Elders.</Q> <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 1, 2, 3. This is fal&s;e. They were not <HI>ordinary Elders,</HI> for they were Prophets and Teachers <HI>immediately com|manded by God</HI> to &s;end the&s;e Men on that particular Errand, as is plain by the Text. Be&s;ides, St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays of Him&s;elf, that He was <HI>an Apo&s;tle, (not of Men, neither by Man, but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and God the Father,&mdash;Gal.</HI> i. 1. And moreover, it appears by the Text to be an extraordinary Act, for it is &s;aid to be done by the Holy Gho&s;t. <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>BUT to let the Gentlemen go on. <Q>So was <HI>Timothy</HI> ordained by the Impo&s;ition of the Hands of the Presbytery: 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 14. And what was then valid is now.&mdash;Upon the whole, if
<PB N="5" REF="039804_0005_101616302EC0DF40">Scripture be the Rule then we can't but &s;afely conclude for the Right of Presbyters, or ordina|ry Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, to ordain others.</Q></P>
<P>THUS they. Now, before I an&s;wer it, I de|&s;ire the Reader to take Notice, that they call it a <HI>famous In&s;tance,</HI> which implys thus much, that they thought it a very good One for the Proof of the Validity of <HI>Presbyterial Ordination;</HI> and indeed, it is the chief Text upon which the Di&s;&s;enters build their unhappy Mi&s;takes. But the&s;e Gentlemen might have been better inform'd by their great Ma&s;ter <HI>John Calvin,</HI> who&s;e Opinion I &s;uppo&s;e will have &s;ome Weight with them. The&s;e are his Words upon the Place. <Q><HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf el&s;ewhere declares that he (without any others) laid Hands on <HI>Timo|thy:</HI> I admoni&s;h Thee (&s;ays He) that thou &s;tir up the Gift that is in thee, by the laying on of MY HANDS; for what is &s;aid in the other Epi&s;tle of the laying on the Hands of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> I don't take it as if <HI>Paul</HI> &s;pake of the College of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> but by that Name I under&s;tand the Or|dination it &s;elf: As if he &s;hould &s;ay, &s;ee that the Grace which thou did&s;t receive by the laying on of MY HANDS when I made thee a <HI>Presbyter</HI> be not in vain: <HI>Calv. In&s;titut.</HI> L. 4. C. 3. Thus Mr. <HI>Calvin.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Summ of the Di&s;pute betwixt the&s;e Gen|tlemen and us on this Head is this. We affirm (and are &s;ure) that <HI>Timothy</HI> was not ordain'd by <HI>ordinary Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters</HI> inferiour to the Apo&s;tles. They affirm, that <HI>ordinary Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters</HI> inferiour to the Apo&s;tles ordain'd <HI>Timothy.</HI> And they produce this famous In&s;tance (as they call it) to prove their A&s;&s;ertion. Now, nothing is more certain than this; that it is the current Opinion of great Numbers of good Divines, both antient and modern, that by <HI>Presbytery</HI> is not meant a Number of Men, but the Office; and in particular Mr. <HI>Calvin,</HI> you &s;ee, has given it up.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="039804_0006_10161631B45C5BA0">
BUT nothing is (or can be) more plain than the Scripture it &s;elf, therefore to the Law and to the Te&s;timony. Let it be decided by Scripture. There Saint <HI>Paul</HI> expre&s;ly &s;ays to <HI>Timothy.</HI> 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6. <HI>Wherefore I put thee in Remembrance, that thou &s;tir up the Gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of</HI> MY HANDS. Thus the Scripture. Now if Saint <HI>Paul</HI> was an <HI>ordinary Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter</HI> inferiour to the Apo&s;tles, then tho&s;e Gentlemen, for once, are in the right.</P>
<P>BUT this Text, I fear, was indu&s;triou&s;ly omit|ed, the Beams of Light darting from it, and &s;o di|rectly pointing at their unhappy Error, they could not bear the Sight of it, but hid it under a Bu&s;hel. But let them take care, for it is a &s;tanding Maxim, That He is as much a fal&s;e Witne&s;s who keeps back any Part of the Evidence, as He who produces <HI>that</HI> for Evidence which is not Truth.</P>
<P N="10">10. THEREFORE, that &s;ince it do's not ap|pear, <HI>that the Commi&s;&s;ion to ordain,</HI> which the Apo|&s;tles receiv'd from our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, was ever granted by them to tho&s;e who are now called <HI>Presby|ters,</HI> they cannot ju&s;tly lay claim <HI>to the Power of Ordination:</HI> Every Commi&s;&s;ion nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo|&s;ing a Conveyance, and being exclu&s;ive of all <HI>Per|&s;ons,</HI> except <HI>tho&s;e</HI> to whom it is given.</P>
<P N="11">11. AND la&s;tly, that they who had <HI>the Power of Ordination</HI> lodged in their Hands by the Apo&s;tles, had many <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and many Congregations un|der their Jurisdiction, as may be &s;een by the&s;e Texts of Scripture.<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tt.</HI> i. 5. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 3. and v. 19, 23. <HI>Acts</HI> xix. 10. and xx. 17. compared with <HI>Rev.</HI> ii. 1.2.</NOTE></P>
<P>So far we may conclude from the holy Scrip|tures them&s;elves; and from primitive Antiquity it is farther evident.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT immediately after the Death of St. <HI>John,</HI> the&s;e three Orders, <HI>Bi&s;hops, Presbyters</HI> and
<PB N="7" REF="039804_0007_10161633499FA750"><HI>Deacons,</HI> were e&s;tabli&s;hed in every Church; and the Power of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> over <HI>Presbyters</HI> univer&s;ally owned and acknowledged to be of divine Right. See the Epi&s;tle of St. <HI>Ignatius</HI> at the End of this Tract.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT down from the Beginning of Chri&s;tiani|ty, unto the Time of the Reformation, the Power of conferring Orders was &s;uppo&s;ed to be lodged, not in the Hands of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> but of <HI>Bi&s;hops;</HI> nor can &s;o much as one In&s;tance be produced of <HI>Presby|ters</HI> laying claim to this Power, and of its being allowed by the Church of Chri&s;t. For the Truth of this Propo&s;ition, we have the &s;ame Evidence that we have for the Canonicalne&s;s of &s;everal Books of the new Te&s;tament, <HI>the concurrent Te&s;timony of the Church of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THAT at the Time of the Reformation, this Power of our Church &s;till continued in, and was ap|propriated to tho&s;e of the highe&s;t Order.</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT tho&s;e <HI>Presbyters</HI> who fir&s;t broke off from the Communion with their Bi&s;hops, and fir&s;t pretended to this <HI>Authority of ordaining others,</HI> did not receive it; only a Power to preach the Word, and admini&s;ter the Sacraments, according to the Rules of the Go&s;pel, and the Canons of the Church, and this in Subordination to their <HI>Bi&s;hops;</HI> much le&s;s did they receive Authority to ordain others, in Oppo&s;ition to THEM to whom they owed, and had &s;worn Obedience.</P>
<P N="5">5. THAT therefore, <HI>&s;ince none can give that which he did not receive,</HI> they among&s;t us, who have received their Orders only from the Hands of <HI>Pres|byters,</HI> have <HI>no valid Ordination, no Authority,</HI> to act in Chri&s;t's Name, as his <HI>commi&s;&s;ioned Mini&s;ters,</HI> and to be &s;piritual Guides of the People.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add farther under this Head, that tho' it was only a doubtful Ca&s;e, <HI>whether Presbyte|rian Ordination was valid, or not;</HI> yet, &s;ince it is confe&s;&s;ed on all Hands, that they of the National
<PB N="8" REF="039804_0008_1016163688E08D70">Church who are Epi&s;copally ordained, are lawful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, it is the Chri&s;tian's Duty and Intere&s;t to obey and &s;ubmit to them, and to ac|knowledge them ONLY as their <HI>Guides that watch for their Souls;</HI> &s;ince in all doubtful Ca&s;es the &s;afe&s;t Side is to be cho&s;en.</P>
<P>AND now, having &s;aid thus much, I &s;hall once more take Notice of tho&s;e <HI>New England</HI> Gentlemen before mentioned. But, before I animadvert upon them, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am at a lo&s;s, and know not what Name to give to &s;omething I find in their ce|lebrated Performance; whether I &s;hall call it <HI>Ig|norance</HI> or <HI>Sleight of Hand:</HI> For I am perfectly ama|zed! that Gentlemen of &s;uch Figure (as I have been informed they were) among the Di&s;&s;enters, that &s;uch Rabbies of the Party &s;hou'd betray &s;uch fi|ni&s;h'd, &s;uch con&s;ummate Ignorance in Church Hi&s;t|ory; and if it mu&s;t not be imputed to their Igno|rance, I a&s;&s;ure you, that my A&s;toni&s;hment is en|creas'd, to think that Men, who call them&s;elves the Guides of Souls, &s;hou'd be &s;o daringly wicked, as to a&s;&s;ert THAT for Truth, which they knew to be fal&s;e, and in a Cau&s;e too where the Souls of Men were concerned.</P>
<P>THEY affirm, Page 7. <Q>That we have nothing in primitive or later Antiquity but what may be reconciled hereto, (that is to the Practice of <HI>Pres|byters</HI> ordaining of <HI>Presbyters</HI>) and much to con|firm this Practice.</Q> And to &s;hew you that this was not dropt from them thro' Inadvertency but by De&s;ign, They are at it again Page 11. where they a&s;&s;ert very roundly that, <Q>We find much in Antiquity primitive and later, that favours this Power of Presbyters, and nothing but what may be reconciled to it.</Q></P>
<P>THESE Gentlemen were re&s;olv'd to do Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, they &s;corn'd to mince the Matter.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s &s;eriou&s;ly, that I never met with any A&s;&s;ertion more &s;urprizing than this, nor more fal&s;e.
<PB N="9" REF="039804_0009_101616380E1842D8">Surely the&s;e Gentlemen cou'd not think to impo&s;e upon all Mankind with their <HI>Ignorance,</HI> or their <HI>Legerdemain.</HI> But 'tis plain, their &s;inking, dying Cau&s;e requires &s;uch mean, &s;uch little <HI>Tricks</HI> to &s;up|port it. They perceiv'd, that the People were re&s;olv'd for the future to &s;ee with their own Eyes, and were univer&s;ally enclin'd to enquire into An|tiquity, being de&s;irous to under&s;tand the State of the Primitive Church, and re&s;olving to pay Obe|dience to that Church which was mo&s;t <HI>Apo&s;tolick.</HI></P>
<P>THEREFORE they thought it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ert, that we have much in Antiquity, primitive and later, that favours this Power of <HI>Presbyters</HI> ordain|ing of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and nothing but what may be reconcil'd to it.</P>
<P>THAN which nothing is more Fal&s;e. Here we will joyn I&s;&s;ue. And if the&s;e Gentlemen will pro|duce any one In&s;tance of a <HI>Presbyter</HI>'s ordaining a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> for the Space of 1500 Years after <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which was not condemn'd by the Catholick Church, I a&s;&s;ure them, for my part, I'll give up the Cau&s;e. There are but two In&s;tances of &s;uch Ordinations for 1500 Years after <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that of <HI>I&s;chyras</HI> and <HI>Colluthus;</HI> one of which was not done upon a Prin|ciple that <HI>Presbyters</HI> have a Power to ordain; nor was it done in Oppo&s;ition to the Bi&s;hop, who was pre&s;ent, but being indi&s;pos'd, order'd a Prie&s;t to read the Words of Con&s;ecration, the Bi&s;hop laying on his Hands. But the primitive Church wou'd not &s;uffer even this to pa&s;s, but &s;everely condemn'd this as well as the other. And it was a principal part of the Here&s;y of <HI>Aerius,</HI> his affirming, that there was no Difference between a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and a <HI>Presbyter</HI> by divine Right, and for which (among other Things) he was condemn'd for a Heretick by the Catholick Church of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if the&s;e Things are true, (and I call upon the&s;e Gentlemen to di&s;prove them if they are not) you may &s;ee what little Ground they had to a&s;&s;ert,
<PB N="10" REF="039804_0010_10161639D8670E18">that they had much in Antiquity to confirm their Practice. Oh, to what de&s;picable Arts are Men driven in defending a bad Cau&s;e!</P>
<P>BUT the other Part of this mon&s;trous A&s;&s;er|tion is as much beyond this, as this is beyond all Mode&s;ty, <HI>viz.</HI> That they have nothing in Anti|quity but what may be reconcil'd to it, that is, to their Practice. What! &mdash; Nothing but what may be reconcil'd to it! &mdash; Why, Sirs! Were all the Bi&s;hops of the Catholick Church for 1700 Years af|ter <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> no more than common <HI>Presbyters?</HI> What! Can all the Ordinations, the Thou&s;ands, the Mil|lions that have been perform'd in the Catholick Church, in all that &s;pace of Time, by Bi&s;hops, and upon <HI>this Principle,</HI> that Bi&s;hops <HI>alone</HI> had the Power of Ordination; can all the&s;e too be reconciled to your Practice!</P>
<P>CERTAINLY the&s;e Gentlemen were out of their Sen&s;es when the&s;e unaccountable Ab&s;urdities were were &s;uffer'd to come abroad.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd Page of their Rhap&s;ody, they a&s;|&s;ert, (nay, they &s;ay, it &s;eems evident to a Demon|&s;tration) the Nece&s;&s;ity of an uninterrupted Succe&s;|&s;ion from the Apo&s;tles. They were obliged to do this from the Nature of the Thing; it being &s;o plain that the meane&s;t Capacity under&s;tands it. The &s;hort Method has demon&s;trated it. But notwith&s;tanding ten thou&s;and Demon&s;trations, they found that it was their Intere&s;t to deny it; and accordingly know|ing that they were not in the Succe&s;&s;ion, at pag. 14, they tack about, and wiping their Mouths very de|murely tell us, that they don't believe the Nece&s;&s;ity of an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Men make a great Noi&s;e, and amu&s;e the People with the <HI>great Names</HI> of &mdash; <HI>our fir&s;t Refor|mers the foreign Churches,</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; thereby intima|ting as if the foreign Churches approv'd of their Practice.</P>

WHEREAS nothing is more plain, than that our Di&s;&s;enters have departed from <HI>Calvin</HI> as well as from <HI>Luther,</HI> in their Abhorence of Epi&s;copacy, from all the Chri&s;tian World, in all Ages; and par|ticularly from all our late Reformers, both of one Sort and another.</P>
<P><HI>Calvin</HI> wou'd have anathematized all of them, had he lived in our Days. He &s;ays there were none to be found in his Time, who oppo&s;ed the Epi&s;copal Hierarchy, but only the Papal. But &s;ay H, <Q>if hey wou'd give us &s;uch an Hierarchy, in which the Bi&s;hops &s;hou'd &s;o ex|cell, as that they did not refu&s;e to be &s;ubject to Chri&s;t, and to depend upon Him as their <HI>only</HI> Head, and refer all to Him; then I will con|fe&s;s that they are worthy of all Anathemas, if any &s;uch &s;hall be found, who will not reverence it, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves to it, with the ut|mo&s;t Obedience.</Q> Calvin de Nece&s;&s;itate Eccles, Reformand.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Beza</HI> &s;uppo&s;es as po&s;itively as <HI>Calvin</HI> had done, that there were none who oppo&s;ed the Epi&s;copal Hierarchy, but only the Papal, or that oppo&s;ed the Order of Bi&s;hops; and condemns them as Madmen, if any &s;uch cou'd be found. For thus &s;ays he,</P>
<P><Q>IF there be any (which you &s;hall hardly per&s;uade me to believe) who reject the whole Order of Epi&s;copacy; God forbid that any Man in his Wits, &s;hou'd a&s;&s;ent to the Madne&s;s of &s;uch Men. Beza. id Tractat. de Mini&s;t. Ev. Grad. ab Hadrian. Sarav. Belga. Edit. C. 1.</Q></P>
<P>AND particularly as to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and her Hierarchy of Arch-Bi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, He &s;ays, that he never meant to oppugn any thing of that; but calls it a <HI>&s;ingular Ble&s;&s;ing of God,</HI> and wi&s;hes that &s;he may ever enjoy it. <HI>Ibid.</HI> C. 18</P>
<P>PRAY take Notice, <HI>Calvin</HI> &s;ays, &mdash; <HI>if there &s;hall be any &s;uch,</HI> &mdash; and <HI>Beza</HI> &s;ays, &mdash; <HI>if there be any who</HI> won't &s;ubmit to Epi&s;copacy as it is in <HI>England.</HI> which &s;uppo&s;es that THEY knew none &s;uch among&s;t their Reformers: And that if any &s;uch &s;hould ari&s;e, THEY thought there were no <HI>Anathemas</HI> which they did not de&s;erve.</P>
<P>So that our modern Di&s;&s;enters are di&s;arm'd of the precedent of <HI>Cal|vin, Beza,</HI> and all the Reformers abroad, by who&s;e Sentence they are <HI>anathematized,</HI> and counted as Madmen.</P>

<HEAD>THE EPISTLE OF St. <HI>IGNATIUS</HI> TO THE TRALLIANS.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IGNATIUS, <HI>who is al&s;o called</HI> THEOPHORUS, <HI>To the Holy Church which is at</HI> Tralles <HI>in</HI> A&s;ia; <HI>Beloved of God the Father of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; Elect, and worthy of God; Having Peace through the Fle&s;h, and Blood, and Pa&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Hope; in the Re&s;urrection which is by Him: Which al&s;o I &s;alute in its Fulne&s;s,</HI> continuing in <HI>the Apo|&s;tolical Character; Wi&s;hing all Joy and Happine&s;s unto it.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">_I HAVE heard of your Blamele&s;s and Con&s;tant Di&s;po&s;ition through Patience, which not only appears in your Out|ward Conver&s;ation, but is Naturally rooted and grounded in you: In like manner as <HI>Polybius</HI> your Bi&s;hop has declared unto me; Who came <HI>to me</HI> to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> by the Will of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and &s;o rejoyced toge|ther with me in my Bonds for Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that <HI>in Effect</HI> I &s;aw your Whole Church in Him. Having therefore received the Te&s;timony of your Good Will towards me for God's &s;ake, by Him, I &s;eemed to find you, as al&s;o I knew that ye were the Fol|lowers of God.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="13" REF="039804_0013_101616419D1192F8">
II. For whereas ye are &s;ubject to your Bi&s;hop as to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ye appear to me to live not after the manner of Men, but according to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who died for us, that &s;o believing in his Death, ye might e&s;cape Death. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that as ye do, &s;o without your Bi&s;hop, you &s;hou'd do nothing: Al&s;o be ye &s;ubject to your Presbyters, as to the A|po&s;tles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Hope; in whom, if we walk, we &s;hall be found <HI>in Him.</HI> The Deacons al|&s;o, as being the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the My&s;teries of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, mu&s;t by all means plea&s;e all. For they are not the Mini&s;ters of Meat and Drink, but of the Church of God. Wherefore they mu&s;t avoid all Offences, as <HI>they would do</HI> Fire.</P>
<P N="3">III. In like manner, let all Reverence the Dea|cons as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Bi&s;hop as the Father; and the Presbyters as the Sanhedrim of God, and College of the Apo&s;tles. Without the&s;e there is no Church. Concerning all which I am per&s;waded that ye think after the very &s;ame manner: For I have received, and even now have with me the Pat|tern of your Love, in your Bi&s;hop. Who&s;e very Look is In&s;tructive; and who&s;e Mildne&s;s Powerful: Whom I am per&s;waded, the very Athei&s;ts them|&s;elves cannot but Reverence. But becau&s;e I have a Love towards you, I will not write any more &s;harply unto you about this Matter, tho' I very well might; but now I have done &s;o; le&s;t being a Condemn'd Man, I &s;hould &s;eem to pre&s;cribe to you as an Apo&s;tle.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I have great Knowledge in God; but I re|frain my&s;elf le&s;t I &s;hould peri&s;h in my Boa&s;ting. For now I ought the more to fear; and not hear|ken to tho&s;e that <HI>would</HI> puff me up. For they that &s;peak to me <HI>in my prai&s;e,</HI> Cha&s;ten me. For I indeed de&s;ire to &s;uffer, but I cannot tell whether I am worthy <HI>&s;o to do.</HI> And this De&s;ire, though to others it does not appear, yet to my &s;elf it is <HI>for that very rea&s;on</HI> the more Violent. I have therefore need of
<PB N="14" REF="039804_0014_101615FF54DE0698">Moderation; by which the Prince of this World <HI>is de&s;troy'd.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. AM I not able to write to you of Heavenly things? But I fear le&s;t I &s;hould Harm you, who are yet but Babes in Chri&s;t; (Excu&s;e me <HI>this Care;</HI>) And le&s;t perchance being not able to receive them, ye &s;hould be choaked <HI>with them.</HI> For even I my &s;elf, although I am in Bonds, yet am not therefore able to under&s;tand Heavenly Things: As the Places of the Angels, and the &s;everal Companies of them, under their re&s;pective Princes; Things Vi&s;ible and Invi&s;ible; but in the&s;e I am yet a Learner. For many things are wanting to us, that we come not &s;hort of God.</P>
<P N="6">VI. I Exhort you therefore, <HI>or rather</HI> not I, but the Love of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that ye u&s;e none but Chri&s;tian nouri&s;hment: ab&s;taining from Pa&s;ture which is of another Kind, I mean Here&s;ie. <HI>For they that are Hereticks,</HI> confound together <HI>the Doctrine of</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t; with <HI>their own</HI> Poi&s;on, whil&s;t they &s;eem worthy of Belief: As Men give a deadly Poi&s;on mix'd with Sweet Wine; which He who is ignorant of, does with the treacherous Plea&s;ure &s;weetly drink in his own Death.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Wherefore guard your &s;elves again&s;t &s;uch Per&s;ons. And that you will do if you are not puffed up; but continue in&s;eparable from Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>our</HI> God, and from your Bi&s;hop, and from the Com|mands of the Apo&s;tles. He that is within the Al|tar is Pure: But he that is without, that is, that does any thing without the Bi&s;hop, and Presbyters, and Deacons, is not Pure in his Con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. NOT that I know there is any thing of this Nature among you; But I fore-arm you, as be|ing <HI>greatly</HI> Beloved by me, fore&s;eeing the Snares of the Devil. Wherefore putting on Meekne&s;s, re|new your &s;elves in Faith, that is the Fle&s;h of the LORD; and in Charity, that is the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Let no Man have any <HI>Grudge</HI> agan&s;t his
<PB N="15" REF="039804_0015_10161644EFE2AAC0">Neighbour. Give no Occa&s;ion to the Gentiles; left by means of a few Fooli&s;h Men, the whole Congre|gation of God be Evil &s;poken of. For woe to that Man through who&s;e Vanity my Name is Bla&s;phemed by any.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Stop your Ears therefore, as often as any one &s;hall &s;peak contrary to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who was of the Race of <HI>David,</HI> of the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> Who was truly Born, and did Eat and Drink; Was truly Per&s;ecuted under <HI>Pontius Pilate;</HI> Was truly Crucified and Dead; Both Tho&s;e in Heaven, and on Earth, and under the Earth being Spectators of it. Who was al&s;o truly rai&s;ed from the Dead by his Father, after the &s;ame manner as he will al&s;o rai&s;e up us who believe in Him, by Chri&s;t Je&s;us; without whom we have no true Life.</P>
<P N="10">X. BUT if as &s;ome who are Athei&s;ts, that is to &s;ay Infidels, pretend, that he only &s;eem'd to Suf|fer: (They them&s;elves only &s;eeming to exi&s;t) why then am I Bound? Why do I de&s;ire to fight with Bea&s;ts? Therefore do I die in vain: Therefore I will not &s;peak fal&s;ely again&s;t the LORD.</P>
<P N="11">XI. FLEE therefore the&s;e Evil Sprouts which bring forth deadly Fruit; of which if any one ta&s;te, he &s;hall pre&s;ently Dye. For the&s;e are not the Plants of the Father; Seeing if they were, they would appear to be the Branches of the Cro&s;s, and their Fruit would be Inccorruptible: By which he invites you through his Pa&s;&s;ion, who are Members of him. For the Head cannot be with|out its Members, God having promi&s;ed a Union, that is Him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="12">XII. I Salute you from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> together with the Churches of God that are pre&s;ent with Me; who have refre&s;h'd me in all things, both in the Fle&s;h and in the Spirit. My Bonds, which I carry about me for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, (be&s;eeching him that I may attain unto God) exhort you, that you continue in Concord among your &s;elves, and in Prayer with
<PB N="16" REF="039804_0016_10161687F5110988">one another. For it becomes every one of you, e|&s;pecially the Presbyters, to refre&s;h the Bi&s;hop, to the Honour of the Father, of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of the Apo&s;tles. I be&s;eech you that you hearken to me in Love; that I may not by tho&s;e things which I write, ri&s;e up in Witne&s;s again&s;t you. Pray al&s;o for Me; who through the Mercy of God &s;tand in need of your Prayers, that I may be worthy of the Portion which I am about to obtain, that I be not found a Reprobate.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The Love of the&s;e who are at <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> &s;alute you. Remember in your Prayers the Church of <HI>Syria,</HI> from which I am not worthy to be called, being one of the lea&s;t of it. Fare ye well in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; being &s;ubject to your Bi&s;hop as to the Command <HI>of God;</HI> and &s;o likewi&s;e to the Pres|bytery. Love every one his Brother with an un|feigned Heart. My Soul be your Expiation, not only now, but when I &s;hall have attain'd unto God: For I am yet under Danger. But the Father is Faithful in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to fulfil both mine and your Petition: In whom may ye be found ublame|able.</P>
