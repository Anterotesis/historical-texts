<P>IN the&s;e Words <HI>David</HI> &s;peaks not only as became a <HI>Penitent</HI> and a Convert, a <HI>Pro|phet</HI> and a Preacher, but al&s;o as became his <HI>Royal Dignity</HI> and State, the <HI>King of I&s;rael.</HI> Not only is it the part of the <HI>Prie&s;thood,</HI> but it belongs al&s;o to the <HI>Prince</HI> and the <HI>Civil Ruler,</HI> to endeavour the <HI>Reclaiming</HI> of <HI>Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors,</HI> and the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of their People from Sin unto GOD.</P>
<P>IT being therefore <HI>Recommended</HI> to me to day by the <HI>Honourable</HI> the GOVERNMENT over us, to <HI>read</HI> publicly unto You the ROYAL PROCLAMATION Emitted by our <HI>Sove|raign
<PB N="2" REF="001804_0006_0FB844294C1DF978">Lord</HI> the KING, for the Encouragment of Vertue and Piety, and for the preventing and puni&s;hing of Vice Prophane&s;s and Immo|rality, and to <HI>Enforce</HI> the &s;ame with a <HI>&s;utable Exhortation</HI> to you; I have cho&s;en <HI>the&s;e Words</HI> of the Royal Prophet, King <HI>DAVID,</HI> to u&s;her in the mo&s;t pious <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> and <HI>Decla|ration</HI> of our <HI>Prote&s;tant King;</HI> in which like <HI>David</HI> He would <HI>teach Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors GOD</HI>'s <HI>ways, and would have Sinners converted unto Him.</HI></P>
<P>YOU are therefore preach'd to rather from the <HI>Throne</HI> to day than from the <HI>Pulpit:</HI> But indeed from the <HI>Throne</HI> of GOD (by whom Kings reign, and by who&s;e Laws they are to govern) from his <HI>High</HI> Throne you are al|ways <HI>taught.</HI></P>
<P>IN the&s;e <HI>Words</HI> of Holy <HI>David</HI> you may <HI>Ob&s;erve,</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>A gracious Purpo&s;e and holy Re&s;olution: I will teach Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors thy Ways.</HI> It is no ways below a <HI>Prince</HI> to do this; but it is the &s;pecial Duty and Office of a <HI>Prophet</HI> always to be do|ing it.

BUT <HI>whom</HI> would the <HI>King of I&s;rael</HI> teach? the <HI>Sinner</HI> and the <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or?</HI> the <HI>Profane</HI> and <HI>Impious?</HI> Yes: for the <HI>King</HI> is al&s;o the <HI>Law|giver</HI> and the <HI>Judge.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>what</HI> would He teach them? <HI>GOD</HI>'s <HI>ways.</HI> The Ways of Religion and Holine&s;s: GOD's Laws and Commandments: the way of Life and of Salvation.</P>
<P>TRULY a mo&s;t <HI>pious and Princely</HI> Care for the Good and Welfare of his People, and a mo&s;t <HI>devout</HI> and worthy Regard to the Will and Honour of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>TRANSGRESSORS</HI> might fear the <HI>Wrath</HI> of &s;uch a Religious King, and look to be pu|ni&s;hed with Severity; but He would fir&s;t have them <HI>In&s;tructed</HI> carefully and <HI>taught their Duty,</HI> and then if they &s;till go on to tran&s;gre&s;s he would &s;ee the <HI>Laws</HI> in force again&s;t them du|ly <HI>Executed.</HI> This was <HI>David's Purpo&s;e and Re|&s;olution.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="4" REF="001804_0008_0FB8442CEBCA05A0">
HAPPY the <HI>People</HI> who&s;e Prince labours their Conver&s;ion from Sin into the Holy ways of Religion and true Godline&s;s. Such a Prince is indeed the <HI>Father</HI> of his People, and in <HI>GOD's &s;tead.</HI> He rules <HI>for</HI> GOD and <HI>in his Fear.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors from their evil ways, was <HI>David's</HI> aim and de&s;ire, &s;o he <HI>per&s;uades him&s;elf of Succe&s;s,</HI> and ex|pre&s;&s;es a humble <HI>Confidence</HI> thro' Grace that it would be &s;o: <HI>Sinners &s;hall be converted unto Thee.</HI></P>
<P>MAN <HI>propo&s;es</HI> well very often, but GOD only knows the <HI>Event.</HI> E&s;pecially is it thus in <HI>per&s;uading</HI> men, who&s;e <HI>hearts are only in God's hand.</HI> How often are we ready to promi&s;e our &s;elves great Succe&s;s, but how vain are our Expectations for the mo&s;t part!

<ITEM>I. <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors mu&s;t be taught GOD's ways.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>In teaching them GOD's ways we mu&s;t pro|po&s;e and aim at their Conver&s;ion to Him.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="6" REF="001804_0010_0FB84431D9536218">
III. <HI>We had need get &s;ome happy Experience of our own Conver&s;ion, and GOD's free Forgivne&s;s of our own Sins, in order to our teaching others the ways of GOD, with any hope of being In&s;trumental to convert them.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I do not propo&s;e any <HI>full Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> on either of the&s;e great and copious Truths, but only a <HI>general Reflection</HI> or two on one and other of them.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>TRANSGRESSORS mu&s;t be taught GOD's ways.</HI> But who are <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors?</HI> and what are <HI>GOD's ways?</HI> and who <HI>mu&s;t teach</HI> them? and <HI>why</HI> mu&s;t they needs be taught? and <HI>how</HI> mu&s;t it be done? <GAP DESC="blank"> Very briefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHO are Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors?</HI> A general and full <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to this the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> gives us 1 Joh. 3.4. <HI>Who&s;oever committeth Sin tran&s;gre&s;|&s;eth the Law, for Sin is the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law.</HI> So that whoever lives in any &s;inful way, in any known and allowed cour&s;e of Di&s;obe|dience to the Will and Word of GOD, he is a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. We are called <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors from the womb,</HI> and that mo&s;t truly, being born in Sin and by Nature under the Power and Rule of it. Every Act of &s;in, and any <HI>one Act</HI> of it, makes a Man a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or in the &s;ight of <HI>GOD</HI> and of his own <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI> The be&s;t man that lives is a hainous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or in the
<PB N="7" REF="001804_0011_0FB84435F0B40C50">impartial Judgment of his own Heart: for <HI>in many things we offend all, and he that offends in one point is guilty of all.</HI> Job 13.23. <HI>How many are my Iniquities? make me to know my Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion and my Sin.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to be &s;ure the <HI>Text</HI> means at lea&s;t <HI>Impenitent and Unconverted</HI> Sinners; and it may be more e&s;pecially the <HI>openly Irreligious, leud and profane.</HI> In this gro&s;s &s;en&s;e our <HI>Saviour</HI> was numbred with <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</HI> And for &s;uch the <HI>Law is made; for the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient, for the ungodly and for &s;inners, for unholy and pro|phane.</HI> 1 Tim. 1.9. <HI>i.e.</HI> to <HI>re&s;train</HI> from &s;uch Ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men, by revealing the wrath of GOD from Heaven a gain&s;t it; or to <HI>doom</HI> them unto Everla&s;ting De&s;truction in ca&s;e of final Impenitence therein.</P>
<P>LET us then under&s;tand here by <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors</HI> all Impenitent and ungodly Sinners, both <HI>&s;ecret</HI> and <HI>open:</HI> the <HI>la&s;t</HI> are Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors in the &s;ight of men, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> before GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WHAT are GOD's ways?</HI> which mu&s;t be taught to Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and which they need to learn. I an&s;wer</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> GOD's ways are the holy <HI>Precepts, Rules and Directions of his written Word,</HI> his re|vealed Will; wherein the Indi&s;pen&s;ible <HI>Duty</HI> of &s;inful Man is laid down, what he mu&s;t <HI>be</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001804_0012_0FB84437A98CC3B8">and <HI>do</HI> to be &s;aved. In the&s;e are contained the whole <HI>Way</HI> of Holine&s;s, the way of life, the way to Heaven Luk. 10.25, 26. Or</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> GOD's ways may here in parti|cular mean <HI>the Manner of his dealing with Souls in bringing them to Repentance, and graciou&s;ly pardoning them upon their Repentance;</HI> together with the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity of in&s;tant Repentance,</HI> and the <HI>dreadfulne&s;s of His Wrath in ca&s;e of final Impeni|tence.</HI> The penitent and pardoned <HI>David</HI> had well learn'd the&s;e <HI>Holy Le&s;&s;ons,</HI> and was well able to In&s;truct Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors both in the way of GOD's <HI>convincing a Soul of Sin, renewing him to Repentance, and &s;ealing to him his pardon.</HI> He wou'd now teach to Sinners <HI>their way unto GOD</HI> by Repentance, and <HI>GOD's ways of Mer|cy and Grace</HI> toward them that repent. P&s;al. 66.16. <HI>Come all you&mdash;and I will declare what GOD hath done for my Soul: I cried unto him with my Mouth</HI> (&s;ay, under the pains of Guilt) <HI>and he was extolled with my Tongue,</HI> (under the Joyful &s;en&s;e of his pardoning Mercy.)</P>
<P>TRANSGRESSORS need to be taught the&s;e things, that they may "neither <HI>fear|le&s;ly per&s;i&s;t</HI> in their ungodly Cour&s;es, nor un|der the Conviction of the Evil of them <HI>de&s;pair</HI> of finding Mercy. Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors mu&s;t be taught how <HI>evil and bitter</HI> a thing it is to tran&s;gre&s;s GOD's Laws; and how CHRIST
<PB N="9" REF="001804_0013_0FB84438E4543390"><HI>hath fini&s;hed Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and made an End of Sin, and made Reconciliation for Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>WHO mu&s;t teach</HI> Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors GOD's Ways? <HI>I will,</HI> &s;aid <HI>David.</HI> Let us <HI>every one</HI> an&s;wer like him for our <HI>&s;elves,</HI> and &s;ay&mdash;<HI>So will I,</HI> and <HI>&s;o will I.</HI> We all <HI>may</HI> do it, and <HI>ought</HI> to do it, each one in his <HI>own place.</HI> Every man in his own <HI>line</HI> is his <HI>Brothers Keeper,</HI> Mo|nitor and Teacher. But more particularly,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> IT is the Immediate Office of the <HI>Mini&s;ters of Religion</HI> to teach Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors GOD's ways. <HI>They</HI> are Called and Separated unto this very Work. GOD has ordained that there be an <HI>Order</HI> of men Devoted to <HI>In&s;truct</HI> others in his Will, to <HI>admoni&s;h</HI> them not to dare to offend again&s;t it, to <HI>require</HI> them to Ob&s;erve it, to declare his <HI>Wrath</HI> again&s;t the Di&s;obedient, and his <HI>Mercy</HI> to them that obey him. Nece&s;&s;ity is therefore laid upon <HI>Us,</HI> and wo unto us if we preach not the Go&s;pel; which is a <HI>Doctrine</HI> of Repentance and the Re|mi&s;&s;ion of Sin, as CHRIST Him&s;elf <HI>came to call Sinners to Repentance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Magi&s;trates</HI> are al&s;o ordained of GOD to be His <HI>Mini&s;ters in the Gates,</HI> there to teach Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors his ways. So <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua,</HI> and the <HI>Judges of I&s;rael, Samuel, David</HI> and <HI>Solomon; A&s;a, Jeho&s;haphat</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah; Jo&s;iah, Nehemiah,</HI> &amp;c. taught their People the
<PB N="10" REF="001804_0014_0FB8443A752773D0">way of the LORD. And the &s;ame is Incum|bent on the <HI>Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trate,</HI> even to re|quire of their <HI>Subjects</HI> Obedience to the Divine Laws, and to puni&s;h the open Contempt and Violation of them. The <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> teach GOD's ways in the <HI>Good Laws they Enact</HI> for the promoting his Wor&s;hip and true Religion, Morality and Vertue among their People, and for the puni&s;hing of Irreligion and Pro|phane&s;s, vice and wickedne&s;s. And while They do <HI>this</HI> and rule according to <HI>Godline&s;s,</HI> it is as much <HI>Irreligion</HI> and as &s;ure <HI>Damnation</HI> to di&s;obey Them, as it is not to comply with the <HI>Word</HI> which we preach. And this &s;eems the real <HI>Scope</HI> of what the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> teaches us in that <HI>famous place,</HI> Rom. 13.1,&mdash;5. <HI>Let every Soul be &s;ubject to the Higher Powers. For there is no Power but of GOD: The Powers that be are ordained of GOD. Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of GOD; and they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves Damnation. For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame: For he is the Mini&s;ter of GOD to thee for Good. But if thou do that which is evil be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain: for he is the Mini&s;ter of GOD, a Revenger to</HI> execute <HI>wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye
<PB N="11" REF="001804_0015_0FB8443BEF211040">mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for Con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I might go on and &s;ay, <HI>Chri&s;tians mu&s;t teach every one his Nei'bour, and every one his Brother,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>Know the LORD, and let us walk in his ways.</HI> You are a <HI>People of Religion,</HI> and are to watch over one another in love, as <HI>Brethren in Chri&s;t:</HI> You mu&s;t love your Bro|ther <HI>in your heart,</HI> and not <HI>&s;uffer Sin upon him,</HI> but mu&s;t <HI>in any wi&s;e rebuke</HI> thy Nei'bour. We mu&s;t be <HI>Exhorting one another daily while it is called to day, le&s;t any be hardned thro' the Deceit|fulne&s;s of Sin.</HI> 1 The&s;. 5.14. <HI>Now we exhort you Brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, &s;upport the weak,</HI>&mdash;and <HI>ever follow that what is good both among your &s;elves and toward all men.</HI></P>
<P>IN particular, <HI>Relatives</HI> &s;hould teach one another GOD's ways: Parents their Children, Husbands their Wives, Ma&s;ters their Servants; every One his Hou&s;hold as <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Da|vid</HI> did theirs, <HI>to keep the way of the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>THUS we may be all of us <HI>Teachers</HI> to one another, being our &s;elves taught of GOD <HI>naturally to care</HI> for each others Souls. And if any one be a <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or</HI> and he come in our way, let us wi&s;ely tell him the <HI>Evil of his way</HI> and the <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> therein; the <HI>Excellency</HI> of GOD's ways, and the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of his Conver&s;ion into them.

4. <HI>WHY mu&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors needs be taught?</HI> The <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> are too <HI>many</HI> to give them all, and too <HI>obvious</HI> to need almo&s;t to name them. For is not the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD written, and the <HI>Preaching</HI> thereof ordained, for this very End? The Law is <HI>nigh</HI> thee, even in thy hand and heart and mouth; and is to <HI>dwell richly in us, teaching and admoni&s;hing one another;</HI> being <HI>pro|fitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for Correction and In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, The <HI>Relations</HI> wherein GOD has &s;et us one toward another cannot be otherwi&s;e an&s;wered, or the <HI>Duties</HI> of them di&s;charg'd according to his Will and unto his Glory. He has made us of <HI>one Blood,</HI> made us together his <HI>Covenant People,</HI> &s;et us in our <HI>Offi|ces</HI> and in a Chri&s;tian <HI>Brotherbood,</HI> told us how we mu&s;t carry it one to another and <HI>fulfil the Law of love, plea&s;e</HI> and honour him, <HI>do good</HI> and be Ble&s;&s;ings in the World, and be <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> our &s;elves for Evermore.</P>
<P>TRANSGRESSORS are &s;o <HI>hard to learn, dull of hearing</HI> and <HI>&s;low of heart, to believe,</HI> that therefore they &s;hould the rather be taught. And <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion to their Immortal Souls</HI> &s;hould be in&s;tead of a thou&s;and Arguments with us, to be <HI>at any pains</HI> to teach them. How do we <HI>hate 'em in our hearts</HI> if we &s;uffer them to peri&s;h in the ways of Sin? It were more <HI>Inhumane</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001804_0017_0FB84444EEA19770">and barbarous than to let a <HI>blind man</HI> go over a Precipice, and not tell him his danger or &s;et him in his way: or to &s;ee a <HI>Mad-man</HI> &s;tab|bing him&s;elf and not hold his hand.</P>
<P>Finally, The <HI>good Order of the World,</HI> the peace and welfare of Mankind, require that Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors be taught GOD's ways. The <HI>Foundations</HI> of the World are el&s;e <HI>out of cour&s;e,</HI> and the Earth and all its Inhabitants mu&s;t <HI>di&s;|&s;olve.</HI> This <HI>bears up the Pillars of it,&mdash;I &s;aid unto the Fools deal not fooli&s;hly, and to the wicked lift not up the born.</HI></P>
<P>THERE wou'd be <HI>no living</HI> here on Earth, if it were not for the <HI>In&s;truction</HI> and <HI>Govern|ment</HI> which GOD has &s;et up among men. Our Sabbaths and the Preaching of GOD's Word are an <HI>unknown Good</HI> to a wicked World tho' &s;o few are converted; and &s;o is the <HI>Re|&s;traint</HI> that lies on Mankind for fear of the <HI>Sword of the Magi&s;trate</HI> and the <HI>la&s;h of humane Laws.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the la&s;t and chief <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> why Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors mu&s;t be taught GOD's ways is their <HI>Conver&s;ion and Salvation:</HI> of which hereafter.</P>
<P N="5">5. And la&s;tly, <HI>HOW mu&s;t we teach them?</HI> I an&s;wer</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>AUTHORITATIVLY.</HI> For it is in GOD's cau&s;e, and in his &s;tead, and we may be bold, as an Inferior Officer may command in the
<PB N="14" REF="001804_0018_0FB84446AFD83EC8">King's Name. <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> may not fear a <HI>Mul|titude,</HI> nor <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> the <HI>Faces</HI> of any. Our Lord taught <HI>as one having Authority,</HI> and he has ve&s;ted his Mini&s;ters in his own Authori|ty: Tit. 2.15. <HI>The&s;e things &s;peak and exhort, and rebuke with all Authority, let no man de&s;pi&s;e thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Great and powerful Motives of Reli|gion mu&s;t be taught together with the Doctrines and Rules of it:</HI> the <HI>Penalty</HI> with the <HI>Precept,</HI> the Promi&s;es and Threatnings together with the Commandments. <HI>Life and Death, the Ble&s;|&s;ing and the Cur&s;e</HI> mu&s;t be &s;et before men, to|gether with the Statutes and Judgments. So <HI>Mo|&s;es denounced unto I&s;rael</HI> that they &s;hould &s;urely <HI>peri&s;h quickly</HI> in ca&s;e of Di&s;obedience and Im|penitence: and &s;o &s;aid the <HI>Apo&s;tle, Knowing the Terrors of the LORD we per&s;uade men.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. WE mu&s;t teach Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors with <HI>Meek|ne&s;s and Love, Affection and Entreaty. What will ye,</HI> &s;aith the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>Corinthians, &s;hall I come unto you with a Rod? or in love and in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s?</HI> He had <HI>Authority</HI> to do the one, in ca&s;e of Contumacy; and <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> eno' to chu&s;e the <HI>other</HI> in ca&s;e there were any hopes of prevailing on them by kindne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s. Read the Character of the LORD's <HI>Servant,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.24. <HI>The Servant of the LORD mu&s;t not &s;trive, but be gentle to all
<PB N="15" REF="001804_0019_0FB84447E2F04A48">men, apt to teach, patient, in meekne&s;s In&s;tructing them that oppo&s;e them&s;elves, if GOD peradventure will give them Repentance.</HI> And accordingly the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> of our <HI>Lord</HI> JESUS have left us this <HI>Example: I be&s;eech you by the meekne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s of CHRIST: As tho' GOD did be&s;eech you by us, we pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead: Wherefore tho' I might be much bold in Chri&s;t to Injoyn thee that which is Convenient, yet for Love-&s;ake 1 ra|ther Entreat thee.</HI> So Gentle is the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> to|ward Sinners and Saints, amid&s;t all its Autho|rity and Terrors.</P>
<P N="4">4. TRANSGRESSORS mu&s;t be taught with <HI>all Long-&s;uffering:</HI> patience as well as leni|ty. 2 Tim. 4.2. God bears long with the perver&s;ne&s;s and Ob&s;tinacy of men, and &s;till waits on them to be gracious. Num. 14.11. <HI>How long will this People provoke me? how long &s;hall it be e'er ye believe me?</HI> We continue there|fore in our Work, from Sabbath to Sabbath, and Year after Year, <HI>in Sea&s;on and out of Sea|&s;on, and line mu&s;t be upon line, and precept upon a precept, here a little and there a little:</HI> It may be they will yet hearken and receive In&s;tru|ction! <HI>When &s;hall it once be?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. And la&s;tly, IF Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors will not learn GOD's ways, but <HI>openly defy</HI> and violate his Commandments, <HI>They mu&s;t then be taught as Gideon taught the men of Succoth, with the
<PB N="16" REF="001804_0020_0FB8444AD89D21D8">briars and thorns of the Wilderne&s;s.</HI> I mean, That open Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors fall under public <HI>Church-Cen&s;ures,</HI> and under the <HI>la&s;h of the Civil Law;</HI> both which are ordained by GOD for the opening mens Ears to <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> and to com|mand them to return from Iniquity. So the cen&s;ur'd <HI>Corinthian</HI> was humbled and re&s;tored: and &s;o <HI>Hymeneus</HI> was delivered to Satan that he <HI>learn</HI> not to bla&s;pheme. And &s;o has the LORD commanded, <HI>Them that Sin rebuke be|fore all, that others may fear.</HI> And for the &s;ame Rea&s;on is the Civil Magi&s;trate <HI>the Mini&s;ter of GOD,</HI> and the Penalties of the Civil Law are GOD's <HI>Ordinance,&mdash;that all I&s;rael may hear and fear and do no more &s;o wickedly.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus have I briefly &s;aid, <HI>who are Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors?</HI> and what are <HI>GOD's ways?</HI> and <HI>who</HI> mu&s;t teach them? and <HI>why</HI> they mu&s;t needs be taught? and <HI>how</HI> it mu&s;t be done?</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>two la&s;t</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Enquiries</HI> may re|ceive a farther <HI>An&s;wer</HI> in the next <HI>Ob&s;erva|tion.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>IN teaching Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors GOD's way we mu&s;t propo&s;e and aim at their CONVERSION unto GOD.</HI> This is the <HI>End of Divine Teaching:</HI> to turn men from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Sin and Satan unto GOD. The <HI>Mini&s;try of the Word</HI> &s;erves unto this glorious <HI>End,</HI> and this we mu&s;t propo&s;e in all other
<PB N="17" REF="001804_0021_0FB8444BA1B5B708"><HI>Occa&s;ional In&s;tructions</HI> unto any. This is in&s;tead of a thou&s;and <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> why we &s;hould <HI>teach,</HI> and why &s;inners &s;hould hear and <HI>learn:</HI> And this gives us a <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Direction</HI> how to teach, namely, &s;o as may <HI>be&s;t tend to the Conver&s;ion</HI> of men from the ways of Sin. How <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> therefore, and with what <HI>Earne&s;tne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Im|portunity, Affectionatne&s;s and Solemnity,</HI> &s;hould we teach you GOD's <HI>Ways?</HI></P>
<P>INDEED our <HI>Solemn A&s;&s;emblies</HI> were a ridi|culous <HI>Pageantry</HI> if it were not that the Con|ver&s;ion of Sinners is the thing propounded in them. And for want of this Actual Intention it is that the Wor&s;hip of &s;o many is a <HI>Mockery.</HI> Moreover, The <HI>Severity</HI> of a Godly and &s;trict <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> in the Church, and tho&s;e of <HI>Humane Laws</HI> in the puni&s;hment of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors a|gain&s;t the State, were a <HI>vain thing</HI> if it were not to reclaim men from their evil ways, and reform them.</P>
<P>WHETHER therefore it be that we teach Sinners from the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> or whether it be the <HI>Lawgiver</HI> who does it, or the <HI>Judge;</HI> or whe|ther it be that Chri&s;tians <HI>privatly in&s;truct</HI> and admoni&s;h them that tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t GOD; both one and other ought to propo&s;e and act for this <HI>one End, to Convert a Sinner from the Error of his way, and to &s;ave a Soul from death,</HI> And this very thing &s;hould make In&s;tructions
<PB N="18" REF="001804_0022_0FB844520A5101A8">and Reproofs <HI>welcome</HI> unto Sinners, whereon in public or in private: <HI>Let the righteous &s;mite me it &s;hall be a kindne&s;s, let him reprove me it &s;hall be an excellent Oil,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h truly that Teachers and Reprovers of every &s;ort, as well as tho&s;e that are Admo|ni&s;hed and corrected by them, wou'd propo&s;e and act for this one End, <HI>the &s;piritual and Ever|la&s;ting Good of Souls.</HI> It is to be own'd that <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> them&s;elves are too often <HI>Defective</HI> in this Actual Intention, tho' it be the very End of their Mini&s;try. And more is it to be Ap|prehended, that the Generality of tho&s;e who come to <HI>hear</HI> have not at all their own Con|ver&s;ion and Salvation at heart. <HI>The Law of the LORD is perfect, converting the Soul; i. e.</HI> per|fectly fitted to this End: yet how rarely is it effectual upon the Souls of Sinners? Truly <HI>Brethren,</HI> the fault lies either on <HI>Us</HI> who preach, or on <HI>You</HI> that <HI>hear,</HI> or on <HI>both</HI> toge|ther. Either <HI>we</HI> don't eno' propo&s;e and act for your Conver&s;ion to GOD, or You <HI>your</HI> &s;elves don't do it.</P>
<P>BUT then, Is it <HI>our</HI> Care alone to mini&s;ter to the Conver&s;ion of Souls? by no means. You that are <HI>Parents,</HI> when you teach your Children the way of the Lord, is it not to <HI>be|get</HI> them again unto God? And let <HI>Children</HI> hearken to their Father that begat them and
<PB N="19" REF="001804_0023_0FB84454955E9C90">unto the Law of their Mother that bare them, that by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD on their good In&s;tructions and Charges they may betimes be <HI>born again.</HI> Take heed that all this pious and tender Care of your Parents for your Souls be not lo&s;t, and turn at la&s;t to your greater Condemnation, and <HI>you mourn at the la&s;t, How have I hated In&s;truction, and my heart de&s;pi&s;ed reproof, and I have not obeyed the voice of my Teachers, nor inclined my Ear to them that in&s;tructed me.</HI></P>
<P>BUT then there is the other great <HI>In&s;tance,</HI> wherein it is to be fear'd that lea&s;t of all have the world of Mankind any Apprehen&s;ion <HI>of any pious Intention for the Conver&s;ion of Sinners: &s;oil.</HI> the <HI>legal Conviction</HI> and <HI>Judicial puni&s;hment</HI> of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, by the Civil Magi&s;trate and Judge. Never the le&s;s it is certain that <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity</HI> obliges tho&s;e in the Magi&s;tracy to pro|po&s;e even the Conver&s;ion of Criminals and Malefactors from their vile ways unto tho&s;e of Vertue and true Godline&s;s: And convicted Sinners ought to accept of their public Pun|i&s;hments and Shames as &s;o meant: Which tho' it may &s;eem <HI>&s;trange Doctrine</HI> and a <HI>ridicu|lous Expectation</HI> in a corrupt World, yet is in it &s;elf the mo&s;t <HI>Ju&s;t and Rea&s;onable thing</HI> in the world; and renders Magi&s;tracy &s;o much the more <HI>wirthy</HI> of the Ordination of a Holy
<PB N="20" REF="001804_0024_0FB8445565B050C0">GOD, and the <HI>Benefit</HI> of it &s;o much the more Apparent in a <HI>Chri&s;tian State.</HI> For if the Civil Powers are ordained of God not only for the pre&s;ent peace and good Order of the world, but al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the Eternal Wel|fare of men; &s;o much the more <HI>Venerable</HI> are they to a people of Religion. Nor is here any <HI>Cla&s;h|ing of Orders;</HI> for as the <HI>Mini&s;try of the Word</HI> tho' it directly &s;erve to the bringing Souls to a better Life, yet abundantly &s;erves to the peace and good Order of the World at the &s;ame time, &s;o tho' the direct and Immediate End of Civil Government be the outward peace, tranquility and Felicity of the People, yet it has al&s;o really a further Aim, Influence and Effect, even in the Religion and &s;piritual Good of its Subjects.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>Humane Laws</HI> &s;erve under the <HI>Di|vine,</HI> and by <HI>That</HI> the&s;e are to be fram'd, and to <HI>It</HI> to be &s;ubordinated.

<P>TRULY my <HI>Brethren,</HI> how &s;hall we take upon us to <HI>teach</HI> others, with any pro&s;pect of <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> if we are not our &s;elves taught of GOD! with what face or decency can we expect that GOD &s;hould <HI>own</HI> us in this <HI>great Service,</HI> or Men regard us, if we our &s;elves are the &s;ervants of Sin! Not but that GOD <HI>&s;ometimes u&s;es</HI> them that are wicked to do good unto the Souls of others. But what <HI>Comfort</HI> can there be in this? <HI>if after I have preached unto others I my &s;elf &s;hould be a Ca&s;taway,</HI> 1 Cor. 9.27. to be In&s;trumental to the bringing o|thers to that Salvation, which we are never like to come unto our &s;elves! how can one bear to think of it?

<P>IT can never be expected that we &s;hall be <HI>hearty, earne&s;t and vigilant</HI> in &s;eeking the Con|ver&s;ion of others, if we have never <HI>felt</HI> our own mi&s;ery and peri&s;hing &s;tate without the &s;aving and free Grace of GOD, nor had any <HI>Experience</HI> of the Work of Conver&s;ion in our own Souls.
