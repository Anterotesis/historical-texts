<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief occa&s;ion of the fir&s;t publication of the en&s;uing Sermon, was becau&s;e of what is &s;aid therein concerning <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> and the rea&s;ons therefor were given in the following manner.&mdash;I was educated from a child in the contrary principles to tho&s;e I now embrace concerning bapti&s;m; and my education had this to enforce it, that it came from progenitors who were &s;undry of them eminently godly, who&s;e in&s;tructions, examples and prayers, I tru&s;t I &s;hall ble&s;s God for to eternity. And after I was bro't to the &s;aving know|ledge of Chri&s;t, I made a public profe&s;&s;ion in that way; and have &s;ince been called (though mo&s;t unworthy) to preach the go&s;pel, and to take the charge of a flock, in which I practi&s;ed <HI>Infant-Bapti&s;m:</HI> All the&s;e, and &s;ome other things concurred to bind me in that way; but the irre&s;i&s;table evidence of divine truth broke through them all. Tho' when this matter was fir&s;t brought in di&s;|pute among us, I laboured under peculiar di&s;advantages, having my mind heavily burthened with a &s;en&s;e of pa&s;t neglect of duty in things of another nature, which at times made me afraid of looking into the&s;e matters, le&s;t I &s;hould be left of God to embrace an error; and this, together with the hot di&s;putes, and vehement urgings that we had among us on both &s;ides, to&s;&s;ed and <HI>&s;i&s;ted</HI> my &s;oul mo&s;t terribly; after which I was much over|borne
<PB N="ii" REF="011557_0003_0F8721C162EACFF0">with melancholy and di&s;couragement for a long time. Yet having &s;ince, through divine mercy, obtained &s;weet deliverance and e&s;tabli&s;hment, them words have often been with weight upon my mind, <HI>When thou art converted, &s;trengthen thy brethren.</HI></P>
<P>And being &s;en&s;ible that many of my brethren are la|bouring under &s;ome of the &s;ame difficulties that I did, and having a view of &s;everal things in this affair, that I have not met with in any human writings, I was inclined to yield to the reque&s;t of tho&s;e who de&s;ired that this di&s;cour&s;e might be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the rea&s;ons which were given in 1756; and I mu&s;t acknowledge to the glory of God, that its &s;ucce&s;s has exceeded my expectation; and &s;ince the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion was di&s;po&s;ed of, it has been often a&s;ked for; and having been repeatedly reque&s;ted to publi&s;h an an|&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Frothingham</HI>'s letter, I thought I would reprint this, and add that to the end of it. I am far from delighting in controver&s;y, therefore at fir&s;t I only made a few remarks on his letter, and &s;ent it to him la&s;t <HI>July;</HI> but he gave me no &s;atisfaction for the mi&s;repre|&s;entations he has made of facts, as well as principles.

<HEAD>The Ca&s;e of the Bond-Woman.</HEAD>

<Q><BIBL><HI>GAL. IV. 31.</HI></BIBL>
<P>So then, Brethren, we are not the children of the Bond-woman, but of the Free.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALTHOUGH mankind are awfully inclined to di&s;regard God's law when in a carele&s;s &s;tate, yet when wounded with conviction, in&s;tead of coming to Chri&s;t, they fly to the law and their own works for relief. And tho', as one ob&s;erves, man's legal di&s;po&s;ition has little need of being encouraged by legal preaching, yet many will teach people in that way; which &s;eems to have been the ca&s;e among the <HI>Galatians,</HI> that occa&s;ioned the writing of this epi&s;tle. It &s;eems that &s;ome teachers had brought in the &s;ame doctrine there, which before was preached to the di&s;ciples at <HI>Antioch,</HI> namely, that except they were circumci&s;ed and kept the law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> they could not be &s;aved. Which was then called a <HI>&s;ubverting their &s;ouls;</HI> and is now called a <HI>perverting the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle gives them &s;mart warnings again&s;t the&s;e &s;nares, and intimates that the rea&s;on why they were &s;o much inclined to the law, was becau&s;e they did not hear it, nor know its true nature and &s;trict|ne&s;s.
<PB N="6" REF="011557_0005_0F8721C2D96DEEF8">And in order to open the ca&s;e plainly to them, he reminds them of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s two &s;ons which he had, one by a <HI>bond-maid,</HI> the other by a <HI>free-woman;</HI> which he &s;hews to be an allegorical repre&s;entation of the two covenants. And after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e upon each, he concludes with the&s;e words, <HI>So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</HI> The words may naturally lead us to enquire,&mdash;who each of the&s;e women are, and al&s;o to look into the characters and condition of their children.</P>
<P N="1">I. Who is this bond-woman? The Apo&s;tle an&s;wers, that it is <HI>Mount</HI> Sinai <HI>in</HI> Arabia, <HI>and an&s;wereth to</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>which now is, and is in bondage with her children,</HI> ver. 25. From that mount both the moral and ceremonial laws were given; and it appears evi|dent that both of them are included here. The ten commands were given from thence, and the fir&s;t tables were broken; the &s;econd were put into the ark and there were kept whole; which &s;ignifies that tho' man broke them, yet they are kept whole in Chri&s;t; to which &s;ome reference may be had in P&s;alm. 40.7, 8. <HI>Lo I come to do thy will&mdash;thy law is within my heart.</HI> This law is &s;ummed up in love to God, and to our neighbour, con|cerning which Je&s;us &s;aid to the lawyer, <HI>This do, and thou &s;halt live,</HI> Luk. 10.28. Which is the tenor of the old covenant, as appears by Gal. 3.10, 12. From whence we may &s;ee how univer&s;al the terms of that covenant are, as to per&s;ons, time and things. <HI>Every one.</HI>&mdash;mu&s;t <HI>continue, in all things,</HI>&mdash;or he falls under the <HI>cur&s;e.</HI> Hence the Apo&s;tle's conclu&s;ion is certain, to wit, that <HI>as many as are of the works of the law are under the cur&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e no mere man can fulfil the terms of it.</P>
<P>That the ceremonial law is al&s;o included here, under the name of the <HI>bond-woman,</HI> appears not only from its being given at <HI>Sinai</HI> as well as the other, but like|wi&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="011557_0006_0F8721C46AB676A8">becau&s;e in this de&s;cription of her the Apo&s;tle men|tions <HI>beggarly elements,</HI> and <HI>days, months</HI> and <HI>years,</HI> with <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as &s;he then was with her children, holding zealou&s;ly to <HI>circumci&s;ion,</HI> ver. 9, 10, 25. &amp; chap. 5, 2. Tho&s;e in&s;titutions of wor&s;hip, and even the &s;econd giving of the tables of the moral law, did, as was now ob&s;erved, point to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but the <HI>Jews</HI> had turn|ed all into works, which creatures mu&s;t <HI>do</HI> in order to be &s;aved; in which &s;en&s;e it was a <HI>yoke which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear,</HI> Act. 15.10. And tho' they were <HI>&s;hadows of good things to come,</HI> and were &s;o improved by antient believers; yet I con|ceive that one de&s;ign of the ceremonial as well as moral law, was more clearly to di&s;cover to &s;elf-conceited and &s;elf-righteous man, his polluted and helple&s;s condition, and his nece&s;&s;ity of a Saviour, &s;ince <HI>thou&s;ands of rams,</HI> or <HI>ten thou&s;ands of rivers of oil</HI> could never take away either the guilt or defilement of his &s;in. <HI>Mic.</HI> 6.7, 8. Hence our Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>The law entered, that the offence might abound;</HI> and, <HI>it was added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions.</HI> Rom. 5.20. Gal. 3.19. But in&s;tead of taking tho&s;e in&s;titutions according to their true de&s;ign, the&s;e fal&s;e teachers in&s;i&s;ted upon chri&s;tians ob&s;erving them as <HI>conditions of being &s;aved.</HI> They pretended to preach Chri&s;t's go&s;pel, but they clog'd it with <HI>doings</HI> in order to receive, in&s;tead of <HI>receiving by faith</HI> in order to do; and herein they <HI>perverted the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> Chap. 1.7. and 3.2. And when any new te&s;tament in&s;titutions or duties are urged now in that line, the go&s;pel is as much <HI>perverted</HI> as it was then. So that by the bond-woman, I under&s;tand the covenant of works in general, and all the ways in particular wherein men &s;eek life by what they can do, either by duties of morality, or by ob&s;erving any ordinances and forms of wor&s;hip what&s;oever.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us con&s;ider who her children are, and what a condition they are in.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="011557_0007_0F8721C51DE89208">
And here the ca&s;e is very plain that the children of the bond-woman, are all that are <HI>born after the fle&s;h</HI> (ver. 23.) that is, all mankind in their natural condition. But &s;hould any &s;ay that <HI>I&s;hmael</HI>'s being born after the fle&s;h, intends an unlawful birth, his mother not being <HI>Abra|ham</HI>'s lawful wife: I an&s;wer no, by no means, for then he would have been a ba&s;tard, and &s;uch an one mu&s;t not come into the congregation of the Lord, <HI>Deut.</HI> 23.&mdash; but he was circumci&s;ed and admitted to outward privi|leges as well as <HI>I&s;aac.</HI> This objection might as well be laid again&s;t four of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s &s;ons, as again&s;t this, their mothers being maids or handmaids before; yet they are ever reckoned to make up the twelve tribes of God's <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> But it is evident beyond di&s;pute, that his being born after the fle&s;h, does not intend a being <HI>illegitimate,</HI> but only that he had no other than a natural birth: he was never <HI>born again,</HI> without which none can enter into the kingdom of God. And &s;o now all who have only a natural birth are children of the bond-woman. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays of him&s;elf, and other &s;aints,&mdash;<HI>We are by nature, children of wrath, even as others.</HI> Eph. ii. 3. And he tells the <HI>Romans,</HI> that he had proved both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that they are all under &s;in, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 9.&mdash;<HI>Jews, Phari&s;ees,</HI> and all the world are guilty before God, ver. 19.</P>
<P>And never did a child more naturally run to its mo|ther for help, than man when wounded with a &s;en&s;e of guilt flies to his own works for relief: his cry is, <HI>Have patience with me, and I'll pay thee all:</HI> but very &s;ad is the condition of &s;uch &s;ouls. They may ju&s;tly be called children of the bond-woman for the&s;e rea&s;ons. I. Be|cau&s;e their work is hard. Slaves have often both hard work to do, and are drove hard in it to do a great deal: &s;o is the ca&s;e here: the law requires not only that which is hard, but that which is impo&s;&s;ible for us to do. It requires us to make us a new heart, and a new &s;pirit,
<PB N="9" REF="011557_0008_0F8721C5D881A6B0">as we would e&s;cape death. <HI>Ezek.</HI> viii. 31. And it de|mands that we make recompence for all pa&s;t faults, and walk in the &s;tatutes of life, without committing iniquity, as we would hope to live. <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxiii. 15. Yea, it follows the &s;oul up &s;o, that it &s;ays, <HI>If thou keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, thou art guilty of all.</HI> Jam. ii. 10. I know &s;ome &s;ay that God cannot ju&s;t|ly require of us more than we can do. But this di&s;covers men's awful blindne&s;s. What! is it become an unju&s;t thing for this glorious Creditor to demand his full due, becau&s;e man is turned bankrupt, and is no way able to pay it! (<HI>Luk.</HI> vii. 42.) O heaven-daring madne&s;s! Nay this &s;ets a&s;ide all that Chri&s;t has done as vain, for he came upon this very footing; namely becau&s;e we were <HI>without &s;trength, therefore in due time he died for the ungodly,</HI> Rom. v. 6. <HI>And what the law could not do.</HI> (i.e. ju&s;tify a &s;inner) <HI>God &s;ent his &s;on</HI> to do. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. Souls under the old covenant are like bond-&s;er|vants in this, that they can claim no right to the inheri|tance, or even to a continuance in the family, but may be turned away, notwith&s;tanding all that they have done, when the ma&s;ter thinks proper.&mdash;<HI>The &s;ervant abideth not in the hou&s;e for ever; but the &s;on abideth ever.</HI> Joh. viii. 35. Since the law is broken, man can claim nothing by it, but wrath and damnation. <HI>The law worketh wrath.</HI> (Rom. iv. 15.) <HI>and as many as are of the works of the law, are under the cur&s;e.</HI> Gal. iii. 10. So that after all their performances which they boa&s;t them&s;elves in, the &s;entence will ju&s;tly be given out, and executed upon them.&mdash;<HI>Ca&s;t out the bond-woman and her &s;on; for the &s;on of the bond-woman, &s;hall not be heir with the &s;ort of the free-woman.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Bond-&s;ervants, when they have toiled and labour|ed many years, are no more releas'd from their bondage, than when they began: &s;o all that are under the law, let them fa&s;t twice in the week, and make many and
<PB N="10" REF="011557_0009_0F8721C69F5554F0">long prayers, and be as exact as ever the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> were, in all their walk; yet our Lord a&s;&s;ures us, that they mu&s;t have a righteou&s;ne&s;s beyond all this, or they can in no ca&s;e enter into the kingdom of heaven. <HI>Matt.</HI> v. 20.&mdash;By the deeds of the law, no fle&s;h living can be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God. So that every unbeliever, will eternally remain under condemnation after all their doing. Ah! deplorable ca&s;e indeed! well might the apo&s;tle think that tho&s;e who de&s;ired to be under the law, did not hear it, nor know its true nature and &s;trict|ne&s;s. Surely if they did, they would &s;oon cry (as <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did at <HI>Sinai</HI>) for a mediator to &s;tand between God and them.&mdash;Hence I proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. To &s;hew who the <HI>free-woman</HI> is, here &s;poken of. And by this I under&s;tand, fir&s;t the glorious covenant of grace, made between the Father, and the Son, before the world began. Therefore God &s;ays, <HI>I have made a covenant with my cho&s;en&mdash;I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one cho&s;en out of the people.</HI> P&s;al. lxxxix. 3.19. The &s;um of which covenant (for I cannot be large in de&s;cribing of it) is, That the Son of God &s;hould a&s;&s;ume our nature, and in that nature per|fectly obey the law which we have broken, and bear the puni&s;hment due unto us for &s;in, and &s;o make reconcilia|tion for iniquity, and bring in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;|ne&s;s, thro' which God could be ju&s;t, and yet the ju&s;tifier of the ungodly:&mdash;As the fruit of which, the Father engaged by the influences of the holy Spirit, effectually to draw many of the &s;ons of men to Chri&s;t; work faith in their hearts, ju&s;tify and &s;anctify their &s;ouls, and keep them by his power thro' faith unto eternal &s;alvati|on: <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.9&mdash;17. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 40.6&mdash;8. <HI>Dan.</HI> 9 24. <HI>John</HI> 16.7&mdash;13. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.29, 30. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2&mdash;5.</P>
<P>Which glorious plan, is &s;o far from de&s;troying, or &s;etting a&s;ide the law, that it e&s;tabli&s;hes, yea magnfies, and makes it honourable (<HI>Rom.</HI> 3.31. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 42.21.) and
<PB N="11" REF="011557_0010_0F8721CA7B4128B0">shews how heinous every breach of it is, even &s;o great that no tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of that law could e&s;cape eternal puni&s;hment without a perfect &s;atisfaction for every of|fence again&s;t it. But by Chri&s;t's obedience and &s;ufferings there is a way opened wherein the greate&s;t &s;inner may be pardoned, and God's image be re-in&s;tamped on his heart, and that he may come to enjoy all divine ble&s;&s;ings here, and for ever more. Hence the Lord &s;ays, <HI>This is the covenant that I will make with the hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>after tho&s;e days;&mdash;I will put my laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they &s;hall be to me a people.</HI> Heb. viii. 10.</P>
<P>Further, by the free-woman is intended the go&s;pel-church in her pure &s;tanding&mdash;Hence in our context &s;he is called <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> which is above&mdash;which is the mother of us all (ver. 26) So in <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 18&mdash;24. it is &s;aid that we <HI>are not come to the mount that burned with fire,</HI> but we <HI>are come to mount</HI> Sion, <HI>and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly</HI> Jeru&s;alem, &mdash; <HI>to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t born, which are written in heaven&mdash;and to Je&s;us the mediator of the new-covenant, and to the blood of &s;prinkling that &s;peaketh better things than that of</HI> Abel.&mdash;On mount <HI>Sinai</HI> the fiery law was proclaimed, which gendereth to bondage; but now on mount <HI>Sion,</HI> or in the church of the living God, is proclaimed the go&s;pel of peace, and &s;alvation: and &s;ouls are brought to embrace the &s;ame. All the &s;aints in heaven and earth, make but one catholic church: but it is in the go&s;pel church here below that God appears to publi&s;h his grace, and to draw others in: therefore we are told that, <HI>The law &s;hall go forth out of</HI> Zion, <HI>and the word of the Lord from</HI> Jeru&s;alem, and many nations &s;hall flock in, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> ii.&mdash;And again, <HI>The Lord &s;hall &s;end the rod of his &s;trength out of</HI> Zion:&mdash;the effect of which will be, that his <HI>people &s;hall be willing, in the day of his power,</HI> P&s;alm.
<PB N="12" REF="011557_0011_0F8721CB70E5AF58">cx. 2, 3.&mdash;In &s;hort, by the free-woman, we may under|&s;tand the glorious plan of &s;alvation, laid in the eternal mind from everla&s;ting, which in time has been made manife&s;t, fir&s;t by gradual di&s;coveries thereof in the old te&s;tament, and then by Chri&s;t's actually coming in the fle&s;h, and working out &s;alvation, which he began to preach him&s;elf, and 'twas afterwards confirmed unto us, by them that heard him, whereby the go&s;pel church was gathered, and increa&s;ed: His u&s;ual way of bring|ing others in, being to cau&s;e <HI>Zion</HI> to travail, and &s;o to bring forth children; for God is the Father, and the church the mother, of all the &s;aints.&mdash;The Apo&s;tle here (ver. 27.) adds a pa&s;&s;age from the 54th of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> where, note, that the foregoing chapter concludes, with the happy fruits of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings, viz. That he &s;hould <HI>&s;ee his &s;eed, ju&s;tify many,</HI> &amp;c. upon which the church who had been de&s;olate as a widow, is comforted with a declaration that her maker is her husband, and that &s;he &s;hould have a numerous offspring, and her &s;eed &s;hould inherit the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;Which leads us</P>
<P N="4">IV. To de&s;cribe the character and &s;tate of her chil|dren. And here we are told, that (as the child of the bond-woman was <HI>born after the fle&s;h,</HI> &s;o) the child of the free-woman was <HI>by promi&s;e.</HI> God promis'd that &s;on to <HI>Abraham</HI> long before he was conceived in the womb; and he exerci&s;ed a &s;trong faith in that promi&s;e, by which <HI>he gave glory to God.</HI> Rom. 4.20. And 'twas through faith that <HI>Sarah</HI> al&s;o received &s;trength to conceive this &s;eed. <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 11.&mdash;There appeared nothing more than the actings of nature in <HI>I&s;hmael</HI>'s birth: but in <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s there was faith on both &s;ides; which made him a wonderful type of the &s;eed here pointed at. He was promi&s;ed before he had a being; and &s;o was every child of the free-woman here &s;poken of: They were <HI>cho&s;en in Chri&s;t, before the world began.</HI> Eph. i. 4.

<P><HI>USE</HI> I. We may here &s;ee the great folly of all tho&s;e that &s;eek &s;alvation, either in whole, or in part by their own doings. This mount <HI>Sinai</HI> gendreth to bon|dage,
<PB N="17" REF="011557_0016_0F8721D66A787F60">and tho&s;e who would get life by the law, let 'em come before it and &s;ee the darkne&s;s, fire and &s;moke, and hear the thundrings and the fiery law, that comes from thence. Surely if &s;ouls come here, they will &s;oon &s;ee the need of a Mediator to &s;tand between them and this God, who is a con&s;uming fire. Alas! how blind are men, that they &s;hould ever imagine that they can &s;atisfy divine ju&s;tice, or get life by a broken law! <HI>Tell me ye that de&s;ire to be under the law; do you not hear the law?</HI> What does it &s;ay? Why it &s;ays, <HI>I&s; the wicked re&s;tore the pledge, give again</HI> that <HI>he had robbed, walk in the &s;tatutes of life</HI> WITHOUT COMMITTING <HI>iniquity, he &s;hall &s;urely live, he &s;hall not die,</HI> Ezek. 33.15. Ob|&s;erve the terms well, you mu&s;t re&s;tore the pledge, give again that you have robbed; not only what you have unlawfully taken from your fellow-men, but al&s;o what you have done again&s;t the eternal God; for he &s;ays, <HI>you have robbed me, even this whole nation,</HI> Mal. 3.9. You mu&s;t fully pay that dreadful debt, and walk in the &s;tatutes of life for the future, without ever committing another &s;in, el&s;e there's no life by that law.&mdash;If you &s;ay, that this is too &s;trait; be intreated to look a little farther into the nature of the law, and you will find it is &s;o &s;trait, that Heaven and Earth will pa&s;s away, before one tittle of the law can pa&s;s away, 'till all be fulfilled, Matt. 5.18. When God treats with men in the old covenant, he deals with them according to the &s;trict tenor of it: and when he treats with them in the covenant of grace, then tho' their debts are very great, yet, <HI>when they have no|thing to pay, he frankly forgives them</HI> all, <HI>Luke</HI> 7.42. But &s;inners vainly expect &s;ome of the ble&s;&s;ings of grace, while they yet cleave to the law.</P>
<P><HI>USE</HI> II. Hence we may learn who have a right to the privileges of the new covenant: <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e (and tho&s;e only) who are born again. The children of the free-woman partake of her ble&s;&s;ings; but the children
<PB N="18" REF="011557_0017_0F8721D7D2B0ED68">of the bond-woman, &s;hall not be heirs with the children of the free-woman. I am &s;en&s;ible that there are many contentions among profe&s;&s;ors of religion about the&s;e things. Many think that &s;inners may claim a right to &s;ome of the <HI>promi&s;es</HI> of grace: particularly &s;uch as the&s;e &mdash;<HI>A&s;k and ye &s;hall receive, &s;eek and ye &s;hall find.</HI> And <HI>if any man lack wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it &s;hall be given him.</HI>&mdash;But if they look a little further, they are told that they mu&s;t <HI>a&s;k in faith,</HI> if they would think to receive any thing from the Lord, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.5, 6, 7.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I readily grant that all the ble&s;&s;ings of grace are held forth to the would by way of <HI>promi&s;e.</HI> (See Act. 2.39. Gal. 3.14.) But I wonder how any think to claim a right to the promi&s;e without be|lieving it. The in&s;tant that the &s;inner receives the promi&s;es as truth, he commences a believer: Hence, the <HI>&s;cripture hath concluded all under &s;in, that the promi&s;e by &s;aith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t might be given to them that believe.</HI> Gal. 3.22.</NOTE> In|deed here God appeals to their con&s;ciences, and &s;ays, <HI>are not my ways equal?</HI> (Ezek. 18.) <HI>are not your ways unequal?</HI> If you keep under the old covenant, I deal with you according to the tenor of it: if you perfectly obey its precepts, you &s;hall have the ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed: but he that offends in one point is guilty of all; and then there is <HI>tribulation and wrath upon every &s;oul of man that doeth evil,</HI> Rom. 2.9. The promi&s;es and threatnings of the old covenant belong to the children of the old covenant: and the promi&s;es of the new covenant belong only to her children. Hence &s;uch alone are &s;til'd <HI>heirs of promi&s;e,</HI> who have <HI>fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope &s;et before us,</HI> Heb. 6.17, 18. None others can claim the promi&s;es of grace, for, <HI>All the promi&s;es of God</HI> IN <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us, are yea, and</HI> IN <HI>him amen,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.20. Therefore to tho&s;e only that come to, and receive him does he give power (or privilege) to become the &s;ons of God. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12. And if &s;ons, then heirs, to all the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.17.&mdash;And as the&s;e alone are heirs to tho&s;e eternal ble&s;&s;ings; &s;o none others have a
<PB N="19" REF="011557_0018_0F8721DA3A24B460">right to the &s;pecial privileges of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e here be|low: this I &s;hall enlarge more upon.</P>
<P>As for preaching, exhortation, &amp;c. God has given them forth in general to the world, and calls all men every where to repent: But &s;ome imagine that the Lord's &s;up|per was appointed for a converting ordinance; and &s;o that unconverted per&s;ons, if moral, ought to come to it. But if it was appointed for conver&s;ion, &s;urely the pro|fane have as much need of that as any; tho' 'tis evident that this is children's bread, and therefore by no means to be given to dogs. <HI>Matt.</HI> vii. 6. Many others think that Bapti&s;m is not confined only to &s;aints, but that their na|tural offspring are al&s;o to partake of it. And I find that the main arguments for both, are fetch'd from the con&s;titution of the old-te&s;tament-church, holding that to be moddled according to the new-covenant:&mdash;though here in our context, we are told that, <HI>This Agar is mount Sinai,&mdash;and an&s;wereth to Jeru&s;alem that now is, and is in bondage with her children:</HI> i. e. the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church in her legal &s;tanding: that church and the go&s;|pel-church are &s;et as wide apart as the old covenant and the new. In <HI>Heb.</HI> viii. the covenant at <HI>Sinai,</HI> is called <HI>Old;</HI> and God &s;ays expre&s;ly that the new-covenant is <HI>not according to</HI> that; and that old con&s;titution we are told, was then <HI>ready to vani&s;h away,</HI> ver. 9, 13. The original con&s;titution of that church was &s;uch, that it took in whole hou&s;holds, and &s;o a whole nation.&mdash;Natural generation (being born of profe&s;&s;ors of that religion) gave a right to circumci&s;ion, and &s;o to all the privileges of that church: And a being bought with an <HI>Hebrews</HI> money, gave the &s;ervant a right both to circumci&s;ion and the pa&s;&s;over, <HI>Exod.</HI> xii. 44. And the covenant that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> mentions in <HI>Deut.</HI> xxix. took in &s;uch as had not an <HI>heart to perceive, eyes to &s;ee,</HI> nor <HI>ears to hear.</HI> But <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hews clearly that in the new-te&s;tament, <HI>The children of the fle&s;h are not the children of God: but the children
<PB N="20" REF="011557_0019_0F8721DB09CB6A70">of the promi&s;e are counted for the &s;eed,</HI> Rom. ix. 8.

<P>But what will, I apprehend, &s;et this matter in the cleare&s;t light, is to con&s;ider it in the line of <HI>type</HI> and <HI>an|titype.</HI> &mdash;It is abundantly &s;hewn in Scripture, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church, and the forms and ordinances thereof, did &s;hadow forth, and typify heavenly things, <HI>Heb.</HI> viii. 2&mdash;6. and ix. 9, 23.24, &amp;c. The &s;eed of <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s being &s;elected out of other nations, and being redeem'd with almighty power, and bro't near to God, to be his peculiar people, and to partake of tho&s;e ordi|nances and privileges which no other nation then enjoy|ed, did remarkably &s;hadow forth God's &s;piritual <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> whom he hath cho&s;en and by almighty grace redeemed; <HI>Out of every kindred, tongue, people and nation.</HI> Rev. v. 9. And as the Lord &s;aid to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> at <HI>Sinai; Ye &s;hall be unto me a kingdom of prie&s;ts, (Exod.</HI> xix. 6.) &s;o the&s;e &s;aints &s;ay, <HI>Thou ha&s;t made us unto our God kings and prie&s;ts,</HI> ver 10.

<P>But in the new-te&s;tament we are confined to no place, (<HI>John</HI> iv. 21) but the <HI>&s;aints are God's hou&s;e,</HI> who are <HI>builded for his habitation thro' the &s;pirit,</HI> Eph. ii. 20,&mdash;22.

And here let me re|mark one thing that is not generally ob&s;erved, and that is, that a ceremonial cleanne&s;s was particularly requir'd in a child, before he might be circumci&s;ed; which plain|ly appears in the fir&s;t appointment of that ordinance, in that he mu&s;t not be circumci&s;ed 'till eight days old, <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 12. The rea&s;on of which is &s;hewn in <HI>Lev.</HI> xii. 2, 3. which is that when a woman had borne a man|child, &s;he &s;hould be unclean &s;even days; and in the eighth day he &s;hould be circumci&s;ed: <HI>i. e.</HI> he mu&s;t be circumci&s;ed as &s;oon as he was clean; which by the way proves undeniably, that circumci&s;ion in it's original ap|pointment, was de&s;ign'd to be a part of the ceremonial law; notwith&s;tanding what many &s;ay to the contrary. Therefore from hence I conclude, that as outward clean|ne&s;s was nece&s;&s;ary in order for circumci&s;ion; and none might partake of it without; &s;o that &s;piritual cleanne&s;s is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary now, in order for any to receive Bapti&s;m, or the Lord's Supper aright.&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e brief hints may furni&s;h us with an ea&s;y an&s;wer to many objections, that are often urged again&s;t our re|fu&s;ing to give the&s;e precious ordinances to the uncon|verted.

But what will you do with this here? the di&s;pute is commonly about <HI>infant bapti&s;m:</HI> but here is nothing like an infant, for they were all married men and women; <HI>Noah</HI> and his <HI>wife,</HI> and his <HI>&s;ons</HI> and their <HI>wives:</HI> and where is the per&s;on in our days that will baptize &s;uch, only on their parents right? Thus by jum|bling type and antitype together, per&s;ons run them&s;elves into a &s;ad <HI>dilemma:</HI> whereas if we take them di&s;tinct, the ca&s;e is ea&s;y. <HI>Noah,</HI> as well as the ark he built, did tipify Chri&s;t: his children were &s;aved, &s;o are all Chri&s;t's children: <HI>Noah</HI>'s children went voluntarily into the ark, at God's command, <HI>Gen.</HI> vii 1, 7; &s;o mu&s;t each one of us per&s;onally believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and an&s;wer a good con&s;cience towards God in obeying

<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. But the Lord made the covenant of grace with <HI>Abraham,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>I will be a God to thee and to thy &s;eed after thee;</HI> and &s;o took his &s;eed into covenant with him&s;elf, which is called an <HI>everla&s;ting covenant;</HI> and as a token thereof, ordered him to circumci&s;e his children, <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. So we believe that now children are in covenant with their parents, and ought to be bap|tized: &mdash;hence <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ays on the day of pentico&s;t, to tho&s;e who were pricked to the heart, <HI>Repent and be baptized,&mdash;for the promi&s;e is unto you, and your children.</HI> Acts ii. 39.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This is the main hinge on which all the con|trover&s;y turns; therefore I will be a little more parti|cular upon it. And fir&s;t let us ob&s;erve that <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;tood in a double capacity.&mdash;As he &s;tood per&s;onally be|fore God, the covenant of grace was no more made with him, than with any &s;aint in the world. The go&s;pel was preached unto him, (<HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 8.) and he believed it, and it was counted unto him for righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 3.&mdash; But as he &s;tood a type of Chri&s;t, he appear'd as the vi&s;ible head of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church, and the covenant was made with him, and his &s;eed after him, and they were all taken into the church, and many favours were granted, or promi&s;ed to them,&mdash;Nextly, let us examine who his <HI>&s;eed</HI> are: and here I find that his &s;eed is taken in three &s;en&s;es in &s;cripture.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. His natural &s;eed, which includes all that de&s;cend|ed from his loins: The&s;e were all taken into that ty|pical covenant; and they had the privilege of the oracles of God, and the outward ordinances of his wor|&s;hip, which no other nation then enjoy'd: they had the promi&s;e of the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and of many outward ble&s;&s;ings there; and in conclu&s;ion that Chri&s;t &s;hould
<PB N="24" REF="011557_0023_0F8721E613C71858">come out of that nation;&mdash;and they had the fir&s;t pro|clamation of the go&s;pel <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 1, 2, and 9, 4, 5.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Chri&s;t is <HI>Abraham's</HI> &s;eed, <HI>in whom all the families of the earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Gal. iii. 16. and &s;undry of them ancient promi&s;es evidently point directly to him, in whom alone they are fulfilled.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. All &s;aints are <HI>Abraham</HI>'s &s;piritual children.&mdash; <HI>Therefore it is of &s;aith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promi&s;e might be &s;ure to all the &s;eed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that al&s;o which is of the faith of</HI> Abraham, <HI>who is the father of us all,</HI> Rom. iv. 16. Now as to the&s;e &s;eed, God is indeed their God in co|venant, which covenant and the ble&s;&s;ings of it are ever|la&s;ting. But then take notice that, though all &s;aints are <HI>Abraham's children,</HI> yet they are not all made <HI>fathers</HI> as he was. He is the father of us all; and they that be of faith are his children. <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 7. As he &s;tood the head and father of that nation and church, he was as has been ob&s;erved, a type of Chri&s;t who is our <HI>everla&s;ting father.</HI> (<HI>I&s;a.</HI> ix. 6.) and is <HI>head over all things to his church.</HI> (Eph. i. 22.) In which &s;en&s;e no meer man upon earth now &s;tands as <HI>Abraham</HI> did.&mdash;Now if we take the&s;e things di&s;tinct, there is no difficulty; but to jum|ble them together, leads into endle&s;s confu&s;ion.&mdash; Typically, all <HI>Abraham</HI>'s po&s;terity were in covenant, both believers and unbelievers: and anti-typically all his &s;piritual &s;eed are in the covenant of grace, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> Rom. iv. 11, 12. And &s;o that text is limited in <HI>Act.</HI> ii. 39. which is &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted upon. <HI>The promi&s;e is unto you and to your children, and to all that are afar off,</HI> EVEN as MANY <HI>as the Lord our God &s;hall call.</HI> There is the limits; as many of us, and of our children as are effectually called, are <HI>heirs of promi&s;e,</HI> and no others <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 17, 18. and ix. 15. And to cut this matter &s;hort, we in general don't pretend to be <HI>Abraham</HI>'s natural &s;eed; then &s;hew me if you can, how
<PB N="25" REF="011557_0024_0F8721E6E04C9DA0">the natural &s;eed of believing <HI>Gentiles</HI> as &s;uch, ever be|come <HI>Abraham</HI>'s &s;piritual children: <HI>that which is born of the fle&s;h, is fle&s;h:</HI> and how came tho&s;e who are only your fle&s;hly po&s;terity, any way to be <HI>Abraham</HI>'s &s;eed?&mdash; If you &s;ay that you are <HI>Abraham</HI>'s &s;eed, and they &s;tand to you, as his did to him.&mdash;Then let me enquire where God has &s;hewn you that you &s;hall be a father of many nations, and that a church &s;hall &s;pring from you which &s;hall be large, and that <HI>natural,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>&s;piritual</HI> birth &s;hall bring per&s;ons into it? Here lies the pinch of the point; a being born after the fle&s;h did bring them into the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church, which is evident becau&s;e, if they were not circumci&s;ed, they mu&s;t be cut off from their people. (<HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 14.) which could not be if they were not in; for there is no ca&s;ting any out of the church that are not in it. Which if it be the ca&s;e now under the go&s;pel, then we have a fle&s;hly and not a &s;piritual church, directly contrary to many texts that I have mentioned, and &s;cores more that might be bro't to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Here &s;ome bring <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. to prove that the limits of the church &s;tand the &s;ame now as formerly, only is changed into different hands. Becau&s;e from a &s;imilitude of the <HI>olive-tree,</HI> is repre&s;ented the rejection of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the reception of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> to partake of that which is called the <HI>root and fatne&s;s of the olive-tree;</HI> which they take to be a partaking of the &s;ame, or like, external, as well as internal privileges: from whence is argued the right of profe&s;&s;ors now to baptize their chil|dren, becau&s;e the <HI>Jews</HI> circumci&s;ed theirs.&mdash;But by the root and olive-tree, I under&s;tand, <HI>Abraham</HI> typically, and Chri&s;t &s;piritually, who is plainly pointed at in ver. 26, 27. He <HI>is the vine,</HI> his people <HI>are the branches.</HI> (Joh. xv. 5.) The <HI>Jews</HI> were broken off thro' unbelief, and the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were graffed in, and &s;tand only by <HI>faith,</HI> ver. 20. So that what appears from hence is, that true faith is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order for any &s;oul now
<PB N="26" REF="011557_0025_0F8721E7A17834F0">to partake of the&s;e great ble&s;&s;ings, de&s;cribed by the root and fatne&s;s of the olive; which ble&s;&s;ings the <HI>Jews</HI> lo&s;t by unbelief, tho' it is called <HI>their own olive-tree,</HI> ver. 24. and they had the fir&s;t offer of grace when Chri&s;t came.&mdash;</P>
<P>Therefore whatever privileges are intended by the root and fatne&s;s of the olive, it is evident that as the branch mu&s;t have a living union to the tree, or vine, in order to receive nouri&s;hment therefrom; &s;o every per|&s;on, both great and &s;mall, mu&s;t by faith be united to Chri&s;t, in order to partake of them favours: which &s;hews, that no arguments can be drawn from hence to prove that any others are &s;ubjects of bap&s;ti&s;m but real &s;aints.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. But it is evident that in old time, God did grant to the children of tho&s;e who were eminently god|ly, many favours and privileges that he did not to others: and &s;o the prophet &s;peaking concerning the la&s;t times, tells the &s;aints that they &s;hall be <HI>the &s;eed of the ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord, and their off spring with them,</HI> I&s;a. lxv. 23. and there is much more in &s;cripture to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e; from whence we cannot but think, that children now are taken into covenant with their parents, and therefore have a right to bapti&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The fir&s;t part of this objection is undoubted truth, but the con&s;equence drawn from it, I think has no foundation in &s;cripture: for a great part of the favours thus granted, are only of a temporal na|ture; and that not only to children, but al&s;o to other friends round. Thus for in&s;tance, not only <HI>Noah</HI>'s and <HI>Lot</HI>'s children were &s;aved from being drowned and burnt up: but <HI>Rahab</HI> the harlot's father and mother, brothers and &s;i&s;ters, al&s;o were pre&s;erved from being &s;lain, for her &s;ake, becau&s;e &s;he received the &s;pies with peace. <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> ii. 13. and 6.23.24.&mdash; and how often does God &s;peak of pre&s;erving the kingdom, and the privi|leges of it, in the hands of the po&s;terity of <HI>David</HI> his
<PB N="27" REF="011557_0026_0F8721E854E8E3D8">&s;ervant, for their fathers &s;ake. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 11.13, 32, 34, 36. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 21.7. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 37.35. So that it appears that a great part of the favours thus given, are of a temporal nature, which no ways entitles to go&s;pel church privileges:&mdash;If it did, parents or brethren of the godly might claim a right to them, as well as children, Yet.</P>
<P N="2">2. If any &s;piritual favours are &s;hewn to children for their parents &s;ake, they are either the advantage of their godly examples, coun&s;els and in&s;tructions, and the en|joyment of the outward means of grace, (<HI>chiefly becau&s;e unto them are committed the oracles of God.</HI> Rom. iii.&mdash;) Or el&s;e out of regard to his &s;aints, and in an&s;wer to their prayers, the Lord is pleas'd to power out his &s;pirit on them, and &s;avingly turn 'em to him&s;elf: then we readily own that they have a right to all the privileges of the &s;ons of God.&mdash;<HI>I will pour out my &s;pirit upon thy &s;eed, and my ble&s;&s;ing upon thine off-&s;pring:</HI>&mdash;What then is the con&s;equence? why, <HI>one &s;hall &s;ay, I am the Lord's: and another &s;hall call him&s;elf by the name of</HI> Jacob: <HI>and another &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe with his hand unto the Lord, and &s;ir-name him&s;elf by the name of</HI> I&s;rael. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> xliv. 3, 5. Note, fir&s;t God's &s;pirit is pour'd upon 'em, and then they openly confe&s;s him. But what proof is there from hence, that unconverted children have a right to church privileges? The Lord in comforting Zion, in I&s;a. liv. 13. &s;ays, <HI>All thy children &s;hall be taught of God:</HI> which chapter the apo&s;tle quotes in our context, to de&s;cribe the free-woman; and then adds, <HI>We, bre|thren are her children:</HI> all which &s;hews, that the churches children in a go&s;pel &s;en&s;e, are only real &s;aints. The &s;ame appears al&s;o from what God &s;aid to <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> concerning the new covenant, that he would make with his people: not according to the covenant that he made with <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when they came out of <HI>Egypt:</HI> which new covenant, is a writing his law in their hearts, &amp;c. and in de&s;cribing the extent of it, he &s;ays, <HI>They &s;hall all
<PB N="28" REF="011557_0027_0F8721EA83992480">know me, from the lea&s;t of them, unto the greate&s;t of them, &s;aith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity; and I will remember their &s;in no more.</HI> From which it is evident to a demon&s;tration, that none are actually in the covenant, but &s;uch as know God, and have their &s;ins forgiven. This is applied to the go&s;pel-&s;tate in <HI>Heb.</HI> viii.</P>
<P>Further let it be ob&s;erved, that this point, of favours being &s;hewn to children for their godly parents &s;ake, was no ways confined to circumci&s;ion of old, becau&s;e, it ap|pears before, in the time, and after that was in&s;tituted.&mdash; <HI>Before,</HI> it appeared in <HI>Noah</HI>'s family, as ob&s;erved above. &mdash;<HI>In the time</HI> of it, we may &s;ee the &s;ame in <HI>Lot</HI>'s hou&s;e, and that not only to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> immediate offspring, but al&s;o many generations after, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hews &s;ome regard to his po&s;terity for his &s;ake, <HI>Deur.</HI> ii. 9, 19. Yet none of them were circumci&s;ed.&mdash;And <HI>after</HI> circumci&s;ion was in&s;titut|ed in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the &s;ame appears without any &s;pecial refe|rence to that, as may be &s;een in the family of <HI>Phinehas, David,</HI> and others, though all the re&s;t of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were circumci&s;ed as well as they: which proves that God's be&s;towing &s;ome favours on &s;aints children, that he didn't to others of old, never could argue any right to circum|ci&s;ion, without an expre&s;s command: then &s;urely no proof can from hence be drawn for baptizing believers &s;eed now, without the plain direction of the lawgiver.</P>
<P>Object. 4. According to this, you make as tho' &s;aints in go&s;pel-times have not &s;o great privileges as they had under the law: but we believe them to be greater now than then.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. In order to &s;olve this difficulty, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider what were truly the privileges that they en|joy'd under the law. And <HI>Paul</HI> plainly &s;hews that their chief privileges were the enjoyment of the oracles of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 1, 2. which were as means for their con|ver&s;ion and &s;alvation: and that they might not partake
<PB N="29" REF="011557_0028_0F8721ECA0DB06A8">of the&s;e means without being circumci&s;ed is manife&s;t, be|cau&s;e that Chri&s;t him&s;elf when he &s;ent out his apo&s;tles before he had by his death aboli&s;hed the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> cere|monies, forbid their preaching to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> or <HI>Sama|ritans,</HI> but only ot the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Matt. x. 5, 6. But now our children may enjoy the&s;e means with va&s;tly greater clearne&s;s than they, without being baptized.&mdash;</P>
<P>Should any here &s;ay that Bapti&s;m is a means for con|ver&s;ion, and as &s;uch ought to be u&s;ed for children. I reply, that I conceive this was the footing upon which the baptizing of infants was fir&s;t introduced into the world: tho' I don't pretend to be much acquainted with the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times, yet I gather this from the account that <HI>Paedobapti&s;ts</HI> them&s;elves give of this affair. Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> in his late defence of the divine right of Infant-Bapti&s;m; though he can produce no expre&s;s mention of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> being baptized in the two fir&s;t hun|dred years after Chri&s;t; yet he would per&s;uade us that the fathers of the third century had the apo&s;tles minds and practice right in this matter, who plainly mention it. But one of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages that he cites is from St. <HI>Origen</HI> in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI><Q>It is for that rea&s;on becau&s;e by the &s;acrament of Bapti&s;m the <HI>pollution of our birth is taken away,</HI> that infants are baptized.</Q> P. 111. And hence they frequently called Bapti&s;m, <HI>rege|neration:</HI> which language the church of <HI>England</HI> retain to this day. But if all were regenerated who are &s;prink|led in infancy, &s;urely we &s;hould &s;ee other men of them, than multitudes of them appear to be. And the notion of the pollution of our births being wa&s;hed away by this outward application of water, looks &s;o ab&s;urd, that I would per&s;wade my&s;elf that 'tis needle&s;s among us to &s;tand to confute it.&mdash;Were it needful. what the noted Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Allen</HI> (a <HI>Paedobapti&s;t</HI>) in his alarm to the unconverted, P. 10. lays down, is &s;omewhat to the pur|po&s;e.
<PB N="30" REF="011557_0029_0F8721ECD3B39C10">Says he, <Q>It is not the end of Bapti&s;m to rege|nerate, 1. Becau&s;e then there would be no rea&s;on why it &s;hould be confined only to the &s;eed of believers, for both the law of God, and the nature of charity re|quires us to u&s;e the means of conver&s;ion for all, as far as we can have opportunity. Were this true no &s;uch charity as to care the children of the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Hea|thens,</HI> and baptize them, and di&s;patch them to hea|ven out of hand like the bloody wretches that made the poor prote&s;tants (to &s;ave their lives) &s;wear they would come to <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> and that they would never de|part from it, and then put them forthwith to death, &s;aying, <HI>They would hang them while in a good mind.</HI> 2. Becau&s;e it pre-&s;uppo&s;eth regeneration, and there|fore can't be intended to confer it.

<P>I al&s;o ob&s;erve in Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> that there is as early mention of <HI>Godfathers,</HI> and <HI>Godmothers</HI> as there is of infants right to Bapti&s;m. P. 105. He likewi&s;e &s;peaks of a di&s;pute that after ro&s;e among the churches whether infants might be baptized as &s;oon as they were born, or not till eight days old: which affair was &s;ettled by a council in <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s time. All which make me think that in&s;tead of having this pattern from the apo&s;tles, the&s;e things were introduced gradually among many other corruptions of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 2. If you think we mu&s;t have as many ex|ternal ordinances of wor&s;hip as they of old, or el&s;e that our privileges are le&s;s, you are greatly mi&s;taken, for 'tis ju&s;tly reckoned a great favour to have that large <HI>hand|writing of ordinances taken out of the way.</HI> Col. ii. 14. The <HI>Jews</HI> had three &s;tated <HI>fea&s;ts</HI> in which all their Males were to appear before God. (<HI>Deut.</HI> xvi. 16.) But there is but one &s;tated ordinance in the go&s;pel-church
<PB N="31" REF="011557_0030_0F872246D319F808">which is &s;o called. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 8. and who will &s;ay that our privileges are le&s;s than the <HI>Jews</HI> becau&s;e of that? Much of the glory of that church was out|ward (as of circumci&s;ion the Lord &s;ays, <HI>My covenant &s;hall be in your fle&s;h.</HI> Gen. xvii. 13.) and they had a great deal of outward &s;plendor:&mdash;in particular their temple built by <HI>Solomon,</HI> doubtle&s;s far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed any hou&s;e that any go&s;pel-church now on earth have to meet in: yet that don't prove our privileges to be le&s;s than theirs.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. <HI>Aaron</HI> was cho&s;en God's high-prie&s;t of old, and then the prie&s;thood was limitted to his natural &s;eed; and the Lord &s;ays of his grand&s;on <HI>Phinehas, Behold I give unto him my covenant of peace: and he &s;hall have it, and his &s;eed after him, even the covenant of an ever|la&s;ting prie&s;thood; becau&s;e he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of I&s;rael.</HI> Num. xxv. 12, 13. Now mark&mdash;here is an <HI>everla&s;ting cove|nant,</HI> made with <HI>Phinehas,</HI> as well as with <HI>Abraham;</HI> but who will &s;ay, that go&s;pel mini&s;ters privileges are le&s;s now, than tho&s;e mini&s;ters of God's &s;anctuary were then; unle&s;s the mini&s;try may now be limited to their natural po&s;terity? A part of the prie&s;ts work was to <HI>teach Jacob God's Judgments, and I&s;rael his law.</HI> (Deut. xxxiii. 10.) which is the work of go&s;pel-mini&s;ters now. Natural birth, and &s;ome outward ceremonies then bro't per&s;ons into the church, and into the prie&s;thood: but now &s;piritual birth, and the work of God's grace is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to bring &s;ouls aright, into the church and into the mini&s;try. As to both, it then ran in a <HI>natural,</HI> but now in a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> line: and there is every whit as much rea&s;on to plead that mini&s;ters in the&s;e times, mu&s;t have all their off-&s;pring maintained by the offerings of the people; and that none may come into the mini&s;try, but their &s;eed; (<HI>Deut,</HI> xviii. 1&mdash;5.) or el&s;e their privileges are cut &s;hort; as to &s;ay, that church-members now mu&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="011557_0031_0F87224794CD1E78">have all their children baptized, to prevent a complaint of their privileges being abridg'd.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid may be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer that objection that is often urged, <HI>viz.</HI> That children were once in covenant, and where were they cut off? For they were only in a typical covenant, as has been &s;hewn: But when <HI>John</HI> the bapti&s;t came to prepare the way for the evangelical admini&s;tration, he told the <HI>Jews</HI> to think no more about having <HI>Abraham</HI> to their father; for God was able of &s;tones to rai&s;e up children unto <HI>Abra|ham.</HI> q.d. <HI>Abraham</HI>'s children are now to be reckoned in another line; therefore think no more of having a right to ordinances, only by virtue of natural generation. And he plainly &s;hews that evidences of repentance are nece&s;&s;ary now in order for any to partake of bapti&s;m; <HI>Matt.</HI> 3.8, 9. So that unconverted children were only in that old covenant, which was then <HI>ready to vani&s;h away</HI> (Heb. 8.13.)

<P>Neither will there need much more to be &s;aid upon the di&s;tinction that is made between the external admi|ni&s;tration and internal efficacy of the covenant.

<P>This view I conceive may give us a true idea of that text which is con&s;iderably u&s;ed in this affair, <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 11. <HI>And he received the &s;ign of circumci&s;ion, a &s;eal ef the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the faith.</HI>&mdash;From whence many conclude, that the covenant of circumci&s;ion was the pure covenant of grace: and that circumci&s;ion then, and bapti&s;m now are &s;eals thereof.

Upon this there ari&s;es another que&s;tion, which is, Whether this great ble&s;&s;ing comes only on the circumci&s;ion, or on others al&s;o? to decide which he takes a review of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s ca&s;e; from whence it appears that <HI>Abraham</HI> him|&s;elf was ju&s;tified by faith, long before circumci&s;ion was in&s;tituted. <HI>And he received the &s;ign of circumci&s;ion, a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumci&s;ed.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Circumci&s;ion (as has been &s;hewn) was a &s;ign of what was to come; but <HI>Abraham</HI> had the thing &s;ignified then wrought in his &s;oul; &s;o that he had both the type and antetype, and thus it was to him a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the faith which he then had. But how could it be a &s;eal to <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> and thou&s;ands of others of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;aith which they had not?&mdash; The apo&s;tle from hence goes on to &s;hew that thus &s;tanding, <HI>Abraham</HI> was a father to all that believ'd, tho' not circumci&s;ed: and a father to tho&s;e of the <HI>Jews</HI> that were not only circumci&s;ed, but al&s;o walked in the &s;ame &s;aith that he had before he was circumci&s;ed; which brings out ju&s;t the &s;ame thing, that has been ob|&s;erved before, <HI>viz.</HI> that typically he was father of all that church, both believers and unbelievers, and &s;piri|tually he is the father of all the &s;aints, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And without this di&s;tinction it &s;eems im|po&s;&s;ible to reconcile many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture to|gether.</P>

This has been renounced by many in the pre&s;ent day, who &s;till hold to infant|bapti&s;in: tho' other godly and learned men when they have owned &s;ome &s;cruple in the ca&s;e, yet have &s;aid, "What &s;hall we do? they are in the covenant who have been baptized, and how can we deny them the privileges?"&mdash;Others &s;ay that though children bap|tized, have not a right to the &s;upper, nor to bring their &s;eed to bapti&s;m, till converted; yet they are un|der the watch and care of the church, and if they are found ob&s;tinate tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, they mu&s;t be di&s;ciplin'd and ca&s;t out. But we are commanded in any wi&s;e to rebuke our neighbour, and not &s;uffer &s;in upon him; and to reprove even the unfruitful works of darkne&s;s, and would you ca&s;t them out from this? that is a great length indeed.</P>

<HI>USE</HI> III. What has been &s;aid may lead us to an examination of our condition. Since all the world is divided into two families, as Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>He that is not for us, is again&s;t us;</HI> &s;o here, all are children either of the bondwoman, or the free. Then &s;urely 'tis of infinite importance for each &s;oul to know which mother they belong to: and the &s;criptures have given many plain marks whereby we may come to know how our ca&s;e is.&mdash;For brevity's &s;ake I &s;hall in&s;tance in but one, which is that, <HI>If thou art a child of the free woman, it is become thy</HI> LIBERTY <HI>to walk in ho|line&s;s.</HI> Herein lies a &s;pecial difference between the lea&s;t chri&s;tian and the greate&s;t hypocrite in the world. Both of them pay &s;ome regard to the &s;ame commands, and in many things their external walk may appear alike: but then the &s;prings and motives of their obedience are va&s;tly different. The hypocrite &s;ometimes does things to be &s;een of men, tho' what mo&s;t commonly moves him, is fear of hell if he neglects duty, and hopes of e&s;caping it by his performances. Hence you'll often hear them pleading, that 'tis dangerous for per|&s;ons to be too confident; and that 'tis needful al|ways to have &s;ome fear of mi&s;carrying at la&s;t, le&s;t we &s;hould grow remi&s;s and carele&s;s in duty; and &s;ome will plainly &s;ay, that if the doctrine which many hold concerning per&s;everance and a&s;&s;urance is true, and if they knew that they were in Chri&s;t, and &s;hould never peri&s;h, they would not care how they lived, for all would end well at la&s;t. But how plainly do the&s;e men di&s;cover them&s;elves to be children of the bond|woman, for they look no further than their wages, or to e&s;cape the whip? We all know that the grea|ter confirmation an obedient child has of his father's love, and the &s;ecurity of his favour, the more chear|ful, active and diligent he will be in doing his fa|ther's will, and careful not to do any thing to offend

And &s;ince it is &s;o often a&s;&s;erted, that &s;aints love and delight in God's law, how can any rational &s;oul, (if they would let rea&s;on, in&s;tead of their own experience decide the ca&s;e) imagine that clear di&s;co|veries of God's love and favour, would make men le&s;s careful to &s;erve him?&mdash;Don't we all know that what men love and delight in, they will &s;eek and pur&s;ue after, without being drove? as for in&s;tance, food that we love, we labour for earne&s;tly, and eat of it fre|quently, without being told that we &s;hall die if we don't.

I &s;hall clo&s;e with a &s;hort addre&s;s to two or three &s;orts of per&s;ons. And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> to tho&s;e that hold the contrary from me con|cerning the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, many of whom are very near to me. <HI>My dear friends,</HI> it may be &s;ome of you will be offended, and others grieved with me, when you &s;ee the foregoing lines. But I think I can truly &s;ay, that 'tis not out of bitterne&s;s, but rather out of love to you, that I have pen'd what you here &s;ee. Therefore I would only beg this one favour of you, namely, that you would candidly weigh what is here &s;aid, in the balances of the &s;anctuary, before you cen|&s;ure or ca&s;t it by: and in order for this, let the cha|racters of all that have held the one &s;ide or the other of this principle be put intirely out of the que&s;tion, or you'll never come to the right of the ca&s;e. That there have been good Men of both &s;entiments is no &s;cruple to me, and I believe not to you neither; and 'tis as evident that there have been bad men on both &s;ides: and &s;hould you try to find out which had the greate&s;t number, it would be little to the purpo&s;e.&mdash; The mi&s;chiefs that I have found by experience in the&s;e things make me caution you again&s;t them. <HI>David</HI> was a man of a much better character than <HI>Joab;</HI> yet <HI>Joab</HI> had the right of the ca&s;e concerning numbering the people, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxi.&mdash;Therefore let us all obey the divine command to <HI>cea&s;e from man,</HI> viewing that all fle&s;h is but fading gra&s;s: and be willing that this matter &s;hould be decided alone by <HI>the word of our God that &s;hall &s;tand for ever,</HI> (I&s;a. ii. 22. and xl. 8.) And if after a diligent &s;earching of the &s;criptures, you &s;till remain of a different mind from me; yet &s;till re|member that to his own ma&s;ter each &s;oul &s;tands or falls, and &s;o forbear all bitter cen&s;ures. And O that each one would with greater earne&s;tne&s;s <HI>forget the things that are behind, and pre&s;s towards the glorious

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay a word to &s;uch as are of my &s;en|timents concerning bapti&s;m.&mdash;Brethren, what I have to &s;peak to you is, <HI>Live up to your principles.</HI>&mdash;How in|excu&s;able will tho&s;e appear, who in&s;i&s;t upon it that per&s;ons mu&s;t believe in order to be baptized; and yet admit &s;uch to this ordinance who give no proper evi|dence of any thing more than an hi&s;torical or doctrinal faith? whereas a believing with <HI>all the heart</HI> is nece&s;|&s;ary to give a right thereto, <HI>Act.</HI> viii. 37. And though God alone can &s;earch the heart; yet <HI>fruits</HI> of <HI>Repen|tance</HI> &s;hould be carefully looked after in this ca&s;e.&mdash; And as little excu&s;e can be found for them, that while they plead that we mu&s;t be <HI>buried with Chri&s;t in Bap|ti&s;m,</HI> yet behave as though &s;in lived and reigned in their hearts &s;till, in&s;tead of being <HI>dead indeed unto &s;in but a|live unto God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,</HI> Rom. vi. 4, 11. Therefore let none while they profe&s;s to know God, deny him in works: but be exhorted &s;o to walk as to <HI>adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</HI>&mdash;This would have a much greater tendency to bring others to imbrace the truth in the&s;e things, than many warm di&s;putes without a good life. 'Tis not ea&s;y to imagine how much u&s;e is made of the corrupt lives of numbers of tho&s;e in the land who are called <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> to bar the minds of thou&s;ands again&s;t <HI>receiving,</HI> or even candidly <HI>weighing</HI> and <HI>examining</HI> what I firm|ly believe are truths which they hold.

And if others &s;ay that we di&s;|regard, and are cruel to our children, becau&s;e we don't baptize them before they are converted: let each head of a family, walk in his hou&s;e with a perfect heart, and behave &s;o towards the little ones that God has given him, as to evidence that he has a much greater regard for the &s;piritual, than the temporal welfare of his children.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I will clo&s;e with a word to all the children of the bond woman, <HI>My dear fellow Men,</HI> be intreated to con&s;ider how &s;ad your ca&s;e and condition is.

But Oh! remember and take warning by your old father <HI>I&s;hmael:</HI> he made a <HI>mock</HI> of his fathers joy, in &s;eeing the accompli&s;hment of God's promi&s;e; which is here (ver. 29.) call'd <HI>per&s;ecution,</HI> for which he was <HI>ca&s;t out</HI> from the ble&s;&s;ings which he had de&s;pi&s;ed. <HI>Now therefore be ye not mockers le&s;t your bands be made &s;trong,</HI> (I&s;a. 28.22.) but fly to Chri&s;t, that your &s;ouls may live.&mdash; And are there any of you who are &s;eeking help by the life of your own Hands; how does Chri&s;t expo&s;tulate with you (<HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55.2, 3.) &s;aving, <HI>Wherefore do ye &s;pend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which &s;atisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your Soul delight it&s;elf in fatne&s;s.

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX, Containing an An&s;wer to a late Piece, intitled, "A Letterd treating upon the Subject and Mode of <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> wrote to a Friend:" By Mr <HI>Ebenezer Frothingham,</HI> Pa&s;tor of a Church of Chri&s;t in <HI>Middle|town, Connecticut.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Suppo&s;e all con&s;iderate per&s;ons will allow, that in &s;earching after truth, it is very nece&s;&s;ary to avoid having our pa&s;&s;ions inflamed, or our minds bia&s;ed, be|fore the que&s;tion is truly &s;tated, and the arguments on each &s;ide fairly examined; yet how commonly is the contrary method taken by the advocates for <HI>infant-bapti&s;m?</HI> Of which Mr. <HI>F</HI>&mdash;'s preface is a notable &s;pecimen.</P>
<P N="1">1. He tells the reader of, <Q>Great divi&s;ions that have ro&s;e in this day of reformation about bapti&s;m, thro' which means the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t has been greatly wounded.</Q>&mdash;P. 3. Now it is certain that Chri&s;t and his Truth have occa&s;ioned divi&s;ions in all ages, though all the blame belongs to tho&s;e who are oppo&s;ite thereto; therefore our principles mu&s;t fir&s;t be proved not to be true, before they can ju&s;tly be charged as the blamable cau&s;e of divi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. He begs the very point in debate, and then char|ges us with the horrid crime of &s;acrilege; for, refer|ing
<PB N="47" REF="011557_0046_0F87225B13632668">to Prov. 20.25. he &s;ays, <Q>Water &s;eparated to a &s;acred u&s;e, and u&s;ed in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, in baptizing an infant or adult per|&s;on, is God's ordinance and is holy&mdash;and tho&s;e that reject it <HI>devour that which is holy.</HI></Q>&mdash;P. 4, 5. Whereas the very que&s;tion between us is, Whether water applied to an infant in the &s;acred name is GOD's ordinance or not? And for him to &s;ay it is, without proof, is a plain begging of the que&s;tion; and if we may take his word for it, is a &s;hrewd token that he has fallen on the wrong &s;ide: For in another ca&s;e he &s;ays, <Q>Mr. <HI>Bartlet</HI> has made a &s;ad mi&s;take, which is common for all per&s;ons to do, that are &s;o unhappy as to fall on the wrong &s;ide of the que&s;tion. He has beg'd the whole matter in debate.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Frothingham</HI>'s late <HI>Key</HI> to the con&s;titution in <HI>Con|necticut,</HI> Pag. 13.</NOTE> Yet.</P>
<P N="3">3. As if this was not enough to prejudice the rea|der's mind, he &s;ays, <Q>Search through the land, in this day of reformation, and you may find that all tho&s;e that have run into tho&s;e wild antinomian &s;chemes, that put away their lawful wives and hu&s;bands, and took others po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with unclean &s;pirits of devils, who were dreadful bla&s;phemers al&s;o: All the&s;e re|jected infant-bapti&s;m as a limb of antichri&s;t, and mo&s;t of them have been rebaptized by dipping. Not a mortal who holds to infant-bapti&s;m, who &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;olemnly practi&s;es therein, has been left of God to any of the&s;e awful delu&s;ions that I have ever heard of.</Q>&mdash;P. 5. Thus he would per&s;uade the reader that good is intailed, to infant-bapti&s;m, and evil to its opponants; but this is &s;o far from truth, that the mo&s;t awful delu&s;ion of that nature that I have known in our day, was in a member of the church in <HI>Canter|bury;</HI> who after he had declared a revelation for a|nother woman, for which the church ju&s;tly excom|municated
<PB N="48" REF="011557_0047_0F87225BD955E6A0">him, procured poi&s;on to di&s;patch his wife out of the world, in order to accompli&s;h his horrid prediction: Yet I never heard him called a <HI>bapti&s;t</HI> in all my life. And though a letter from <HI>Middletown</HI> informs me, that Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has named <HI>Dowglas</HI> and <HI>Abbe,</HI> in his &s;ermons, as beginning their antinomiani&s;m with denying infant-bapti&s;m; yet I can truly declare, that I was called to preach to a &s;ociety in <HI>Windham,</HI> in <HI>April</HI> 1747, &s;oon after they broached their delu&s;ions there, and I preached there frequently till the next <HI>September,</HI> had conver&s;e with the&s;e men, and was &s;ome|times interrupted in my preaching by them; yet I can't recollect that I ever heard them &s;ay one word again&s;t infant-bapti&s;m; and I cannot learn by my bre|thren in the next town, that they have ever heard them called <HI>bapti&s;ts</HI> to this day.</P>
<P>I am not willing to charge him with known fal&s;hood in this affair; and rather think that as there have been a number who were called bapti&s;ts in our day, who have gone into the delu&s;ions he &s;peaks of, therefore he has been carried away with the cu&s;tom which has been followed the&s;e two hundred years, to impute all that is evil to the bapti&s;ts. But when will men have done with thinking it will do to <HI>talk wickedly for God!</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Having repre&s;ented our way in &s;uch a horrid light, Mr. <HI>F.</HI> proceeds to tell the reader of a number, who have been convinced of its being an error, and have returned to the practice of infant-bapti&s;m, of which he was one; and &s;ays he went &s;o far, that if he had met with a bapti&s;t elder, he &s;hould have been re-baptized. And while he would repre&s;ent that we act upon &s;cruples and negatives, he &s;ays, <Q>I was bro't to &s;ee, ina&s;much as I <HI>was</HI> baptized, it was nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ee from the written word, that infants had <HI>not</HI> a right to bapti&s;m before I went forward to an&s;wer a good con&s;cience,</Q> &amp;c. p. 6. Here again
<PB N="49" REF="011557_0048_0F87225D4AB64770">he begs the que&s;tion, which is, Whether he is truly baptized or not? And concludes that he <HI>was</HI> baptized, and then re&s;olves to hold the &s;ame till he can &s;ee from the <HI>written</HI> word that infants have <HI>not</HI> a right; that is, till he can &s;ee the <HI>letter</HI> of the word condemn infant-bapti&s;m, which is never named in any writings either divine or human, till two hundred years after Chri&s;t. This is one in&s;tance among many of our &s;hort-&s;ighted|ne&s;s; for while others are charged with &s;ticking to the letter, and acting upon negatives, he determines to hold his practice till he can find in the letter a univer|&s;al negative again&s;t it: Yet in other ca&s;es he would doubtle&s;s tell people, that in ordinances of wor&s;hip it is not enough for us to &s;ay, It is not forbidden; for we mu&s;t be able to an&s;wer that demand, Who hath <HI>required</HI> this at your hand? I&s;a. 1.12. After this ac|count of him&s;elf, he proceeds to tell us, that be&s;ide private chri&s;tians he has known eight ordained elders that had been re-baptized, who have &s;ince retracted it. But if they did it upon the &s;ame principle that he did, ten thou&s;and times that number would not give us a warrant to follow them. The truth is, about 20 years ago in a &s;ea&s;on of awakning and hopeful conver&s;ions in &s;everal places, the two denominations were brought to greater freedom toward each other, than in former times, which was a means of bringing many to a better under&s;tanding of the bapti&s;ts principles, than they for|merly had, and many embraced them; which cau&s;ed others to ri&s;e in great oppo&s;ition thereto, and &s;ome leading men gave the alarm much as Mr. <HI>F.</HI> does in this preface. And a number were frightned and turn|ed back; though I &s;hould think they have no great cau&s;e of glorying therein; for two of the eight mini|&s;ters that he &s;peaks of, fell &s;o much out of credit, as to drop preaching, and inli&s;ted as &s;oldiers into the army, and laid their bones in the wilderne&s;s. Two more of
<PB N="50" REF="011557_0049_0F8720D60059A920">them, parted from their flocks, and though they were &s;ettled over others, yet they did not continue there, but are now in an un&s;ettled &s;tate; and others can hardly treat their bapti&s;t brethren with a good temper. On the other hand, I have heard many confe&s;s that they have been afraid of the light in this matter, and after many years oppo&s;ition, have given as rational and &s;criptural accounts of their being convinced that our principles were right, as I ever heard in any ca&s;e whatever.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>F.</HI> &s;ays, <Q>All the &s;ober &s;olid bapti&s;ts, would likely renounce their conduct in this ca&s;e al&s;o, could they calmly, and with a &s;ingle eye, &s;earch the &s;crip|tures in this matter.</Q>&mdash;P. 6. But whether he has taken a proper method to introduce &s;uch a <HI>calm</HI> &s;earch or not, is left to the reader's judgment; and whether he has or not, yet oh that &s;uch a temper may be now granted to us!</P>
<P>As to the rule it&s;elf, I agree with him, that &s;atan lays two &s;nares to hinder our taking of it right; one is to impo&s;e upon the judgment by an elevated imagination of &s;omething new and wonderful in the &s;criptures, taking plain pa&s;&s;ages and turning them into an allegorical &s;train or figurative &s;en&s;e, &s;o that the judgment mi&s;&s;eth the duties taught or doctrines contained in the text: Or el&s;e, when it will &s;uit his turn, he will try to keep us to the bare letter of the word, without regarding the true nature of God's will contained therein. And I fully concur, that when we take the &s;criptures right, they have <Q>a natural tendency to lead the mind into a conformity to God's pure nature, which al&s;o tends to humble and purify the heart, and lead the mind into an under&s;tanding of the divine <HI>harmony</HI> of the &s;crip|tures, which opens a path that leads home to glory.</Q> P. 7, 8. In that path may we ever walk!
<PB N="51" REF="011557_0050_0F8720D7AA536360">I would here add, that our Lord's con&s;tant method of repelling the tempter, was by &s;aying, <HI>It is written.</HI> And when the adver&s;ary attempted to in&s;nare him in the &s;ame way, he would not depart from it to my|&s;tical meaning, but brought another text which cut directly acro&s;s the partial &s;en&s;e which the devil would put upon &s;cripture. It is a known rule in divinity, not to depart from the literal &s;en&s;e of a text, when it will clearly agree with the re&s;t of the bible; but if that &s;en&s;e will not agree with other texts, then we may know it has a my&s;tical, and not a literal meaning. As for in&s;tance, <HI>David</HI> &s;ays, <HI>My fle&s;h &s;hall re&s;t in hope, becau&s;e thou wilt not leave my &s;oul in hell, neither wilt thou &s;uffer thine holy One to &s;ee corruption.</HI> Now other &s;criptures evidence that <HI>Da|vid</HI>'s fle&s;h &s;aw corruption, from whence <HI>Peter</HI> de|mon&s;trates, that it is not literal but &s;piritual <HI>David</HI> who is there intended, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.25&mdash;31. Yet the re&s;t of the text &s;tands good in its literal &s;en&s;e, el&s;e the apo&s;tle could not have proved his point (Je&s;us's re&s;urrection) from it; for only turn the words fle&s;h and corruption, to a my&s;tical &s;en&s;e, and the re&s;urrection of the Me&s;&s;iah's body could never be proved from that text. Hence we may learn that the literal &s;en&s;e of every text, and part of a text, is not to be departed from, when it clearly agrees with the analogy of faith. At the &s;ame time the plaine&s;t pa&s;&s;ages may admit of many my&s;tical or &s;piritual improvements, while the literal &s;en&s;e &s;tands good. It was never the le&s;s true in a literal &s;en&s;e, that <HI>Abraham</HI> had two &s;ons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free woman, becau&s;e <HI>Paul</HI> drew an allegory from thence concerning the two co|venants: Yea, &s;o far from it, that the literal facts are the foundation he goes upon in his allegory.</P>
<P>Now let us come to apply the&s;e rules to the ca&s;e before us. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> agrees with us, that, <Q>Read where
<PB N="52" REF="011557_0051_0F8720D81D0A47C8">you will in the &s;criptures, faith is put before bap|tizing, as to adult per&s;ons, that never were baptized.</Q> And he &s;ays, <Q>The point in debate is, whether the infants of believers are &s;ubjects or not?</Q>&mdash;P. 4. He holds that they are, and to prove it turns us to <HI>Abra|ham</HI>'s covenant; and attempts to prove,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it was the covenant of grace.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That <HI>Abraham</HI>'s chil|dren were included therein.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Gentile church is graffed into the &s;ame covenant. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That their children are taken in with them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But in order to &s;ettle this matter, it is needful to ex|plain what we mean by the&s;e terms. I fully concur with Mr. <HI>F.</HI> that, <Q>Since <HI>Adam,</HI> our fir&s;t natural head, fell from the covenant which he was placed in, the tenor of which was, <HI>do and live; tran&s;gre&s;s and die,</HI> the Mo&s;t High has never come to commune with any of the race of <HI>Adam,</HI> nor to offer good to them, but only in the &s;econd Head, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> P. 9, 10. And if by covenant of grace, we mean the glorious plan of &s;alvation, which was laid in the divine mind from eternity, and was di&s;covered at <HI>&s;undry times and in divers manners</HI> to the <HI>fathers</HI> in the old te&s;ta|ment, and is brought into clear light in the new; and that one of tho&s;e <HI>divers manners,</HI> was by <HI>Abraham</HI>'s covenant: In this we have no difference. But if by the covenant of grace, he means the con&s;titution, and limits of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church, which de&s;cended in the line of natural generation, taking in with the parents all their natural offspring, which is evidently his meaning; in this I cannot concur with him, for the&s;e rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">I. Becau&s;e this is an attempt to <HI>make man wi&s;er than God.</HI> For <HI>Paul</HI> in treating of the ble&s;&s;ings which the go&s;pel reveals, &s;ays, <HI>Which things we &s;peak, not in the</HI> WORDS <HI>which man's wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the</HI> HOLY GHOST <HI>teacheth; comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.13. And in explaining
<PB N="53" REF="011557_0052_0F8720D8E2E5F5C0">the de&s;ign and end of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> covenant and ordi|nances, he &s;ays, the <HI>new covenant</HI> is <HI>not according</HI> to that which was made with <HI>their fathers,</HI> Heb. 8. 9. Yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> will dare to a&s;&s;ert, that the apo&s;tle, <Q>Is not in this text &s;peaking of two covenants, di&s;tinct in their nature and original; but of the &s;ame cove|nant, under two different admini&s;trations?</Q> P. 11. And he charges us with "ignorance," p. 13. becau&s;e we will not contradict the Holy Gho&s;t as he does! He would have it that we bring tho&s;e words in a wrong &s;en&s;e; but in&s;tead of following our Lord's example, and bringing another text which is <HI>written,</HI> contrary to our &s;en&s;e of this, he brings the language of <HI>man's wi&s;|dom</HI> to contradict the language of divine in&s;piration; for he owns that, <Q>we do not read the word, Chri&s;t, nor grace, nor faith, nor the new covenant in Gen. 17.</Q> P. 9. And yet will venture to bring that chapter to contradict what is expre&s;t in Heb. 8. 9.</P>

<ITEM>1. In the &s;eal of it; the fle&s;h of their fore|&s;kin was to be circumci&s;ed, and God &s;aid to <HI>Abraham, My covenant &s;hall be in your fle&s;h:</HI> While he &s;ays of the new covenant, <HI>I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their bearts.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In the way they are brought into covenant. Natural birth, or purcha&s;e for money, brought per&s;ons into <HI>Abraham</HI>'s covenant; while 'tis only Chri&s;t's purcha&s;e and the new birth that brings any into the new covenant.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The tenor of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s covenant enjoins conditions and works to be performed by men; the neglect of which expo&s;ed them to be <HI>cut off from their people,</HI> becau&s;e they had <HI>broken</HI> that <HI>covenant,</HI> Gen. 17.14.</ITEM>
</LIST> Therefore the <HI>letter</HI> of it was, <HI>Do and live;</HI> and the rea&s;on here given for &s;etting of it a&s;ide is, <HI>becau&s;e they continued not in it, and I regarded them not, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> But the
<PB N="54" REF="011557_0053_0F8720D9B489C888">tenor of the new covenant is, <HI>I will be to them a God, and they &s;hall be to me a people,</HI> Heb. 8.9, 10.4. The&s;e covenants differ greatly as to the &s;tate of tho&s;e who are under them. The &s;tate that <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were in when they were called forth by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to enter into covenant, <HI>As</HI> God had <HI>&s;worn to their father</HI> Abraham, was &s;uch that they had <HI>not an heart to perceive,&mdash;eyes to &s;ee, nor ears to hear,</HI> no not unto <HI>that day,</HI> Deut. 29.4,&mdash;13.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> in his late dialogues again&s;t a half-way covenant; Mr. <HI>Green</HI> and others, have a&s;&s;erted that all the members of that church were received upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that they were true believers; whereas <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was &s;o far from receiving them upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, that in this text he openly declared the contrary, as plainly as words can expre&s;s. And Mr. <HI>Beckwith,</HI> makes u&s;e of this text, again&s;t Mr. <HI>Green,</HI> to prove that a profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving faith is not nece&s;&s;ary in order to come into a go&s;pel church P. 71, 72. Such are the effects of confounding the two covenants together; for Mr. <HI>Beckwith</HI> declares that the grand point in this debate is, <Q>Whether the Gentile church is not taken into the <HI>&s;ame</HI> covenant God e&s;tabli&s;hed with the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church?</Q> P 101. And he has confu&s;ed and darkened things &s;o much in this way, that he at la&s;t ventures to a&s;&s;ert that we have no rea&s;on to think that "any thing more is intended," in the <HI>Eunuch's</HI> profe&s;&s;ion, in Acts 8.37. but a belief, "up|on moral evidence," and therefore, that it did not imply a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving faith. P. 55. Which notion of his is as certainly fal&s;e, as Rom. 10, 9, 10. is true.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the &s;tate of tho&s;e who are under the new cove|nant is, they <HI>all know the Lord from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t, and their &s;ins and iniquities he will remember no more,</HI> Heb. 8.11, 12. and 10.17.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has two ways to evade the force of this rea|&s;oning: The fir&s;t is to tell us we &s;tick to the <HI>letter.</HI> If in this he has any reference to 2 Cor. 3.6. I de&s;ire it may be noted that <HI>Paul</HI> is there opening the differ|ence between the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and chri&s;tian mini&s;try, and &s;hews that the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e to the letter, both of the moral and ceremonial law, that they could not
<PB N="55" REF="011557_0054_0F8720DA60A68D10"><HI>&s;tedfa&s;tly look to the end of that which is aboli&s;hed;</HI> and this <HI>vail</HI> kept them from &s;eeing the glorious fulfilment of the law in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who <HI>giveth life;</HI> but the <HI>letter killeth.</HI> In &s;hort, with the <HI>letter</HI> of the old te&s;ta|ment, they would exclude the <HI>truth</HI> of the new; and the reader is left to judge who comes neare&s;t to &s;uch conduct now.</P>
<P>His other eva&s;ion is by charging us with, <Q>Not di&s;tingui&s;hing between a &s;oul's being internally united to Chri&s;t, and a per&s;on's being in vi&s;ible covenant relation.</Q> P. 31. But this charge is very unju&s;t, for we are well &s;en&s;ible of that di&s;tinction, and the di&s;|pute is not whether &s;ome may not, through man's im|perfection, be admitted as true believers who are not &s;o; but it is, whether the rule gives us warrant to baptize any without a per&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion of their being &s;uch or not? Tho&s;e who were baptized in the fir&s;t chri&s;tian church, were they that <HI>gladly received the word;</HI> and tho&s;e which the Lord added to that church were <HI>&s;uch as &s;hould be &s;aved,</HI> Acts 2.41, 47. And when two per&s;ons had crept in, who were fal&s;e heart|ed, they were awfully &s;truck dead, as a warning to others, and it had that effect; for we read that, <HI>of the re&s;t dur&s;t no man join him&s;elf to them; but believers were the more added to the Lord,</HI> Act. 5.13, 14. And when the people of <HI>Samaria</HI> believed and were baptized, yet as &s;oon as one of them di&s;covered his un&s;oundne&s;s, <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid to him, <HI>Thou ha&s;t neither part nor lot in this matter;</HI> and for this rea&s;on, be|cau&s;e <HI>thy heart is not right in the &s;ight of God,</HI> Acts 8.21. Here this di&s;tinction is plain; they were re|ceived to bapti&s;m as true believers, and were rejected when they di&s;covered that they were not &s;uch. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved in <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. compared with <HI>John</HI> 15. Chri&s;t is the <HI>Vine,</HI> his members are <HI>graffed</HI> in, and <HI>&s;tand by faith</HI> in him; but if any are received
<PB N="56" REF="011557_0055_0F8720DB4AEF8B98">as branches of him who is the Head of his church, that prove fruitle&s;s, they will be <HI>broken off,</HI> and <HI>taken away,</HI> while living branches are <HI>purged</HI> that they may bring forth <HI>more fruit.</HI> Take the di&s;tinction thus, and the &s;en&s;e is clear; but take it as Mr. <HI>F.</HI> does, that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> are brought into the <HI>&s;ame</HI> covenant with the <HI>Jews,</HI> p. 18. and the natural con&s;equence is a national church; for all know the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church was national. At the &s;ame time <HI>Arminians</HI> draw an argument from hence for their doctrine of falling from grace; and the &s;en&s;e given above, is the be&s;t guard again&s;t both of the&s;e abu&s;es of the apo&s;tles di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">III. I can't concur with Mr. <HI>F</HI>&mdash;'s &s;cheme, becau&s;e it tends to de&s;troy that <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> between the church and the world, which was de&s;igned by all tho&s;e covenants. In the fir&s;t di&s;covery of grace which God ever made to fallen man, he made a di&s;tinction and declared an irreconcilable enmity between the <HI>two &s;eeds;</HI> which was verified in the two fir&s;t children who were born: And after the wicked &s;on had killed his brother, and <HI>Seth</HI> was born, he was &s;aid to be <HI>another &s;eed in&s;tead of</HI> Abel <HI>whom</HI> Cain <HI>&s;lew.</HI> And for many generations the di&s;tinction was kept up between the <HI>&s;ons of God,</HI> and the <HI>children of men:</HI> And when they had <HI>corrupt|ed their way,</HI> and lo&s;t this di&s;tinction, God &s;aid to <HI>Noah, The end of all fle&s;h is come before me;&mdash;I will de&s;troy them with the earth; but with thee will I e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant,</HI> Gen. 6.13, 18. Accordingly he and his family were &s;aved, while the world was de|&s;troyed, and religion was handed down among his po&s;terity for &s;ome ages; and when they had turned to idolatry, God called Abraham <HI>alone and ble&s;&s;ed him,</HI> I&s;a 51.2. And carried his &s;eed through an <HI>iron furnace</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and wrought great wonders for them in the wilderne&s;s, and in the promi&s;ed land, and gave them &s;uch laws and ordinances as were &s;ufficient to
<PB N="57" REF="011557_0056_0F8720DBF2A32E38">keep them a religious people, in di&s;tinction from all others, if it was po&s;&s;ible for outward means to do it. <HI>But the chief of the prie&s;ts, and of the people, tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed very much, after all the abominations of the Heathen;&mdash;therefore the Lord brought upon them the King of the</HI> Chaldees, 2 Chron. 36.14,&mdash;17.</P>
<P>Hitherto covenants had included parents with their natural offspring; but at this time the Lord &s;aid to the prophet, <HI>Behold the days come that I will make a new covenant with the hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael; NOT AC|CORDING <HI>to the covenant that I made with their fa|thers,</HI> Jer. 31.31, &amp;c. And the new te&s;tament &s;hews abundantly that the difference lies in this, that the co|venant now runs in a &s;piritual and not in a natural line. The apo&s;tle in the ninth of the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;hews, that the line runs, not in the <HI>children of the fle&s;h,</HI> but in the <HI>children of God,</HI> who are a <HI>remnant</HI> that <HI>&s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> And in the tenth chapter he opens the order of the go&s;pel;&mdash;<HI>that faith cometh by hearing the word of God,</HI> (not by natural de&s;cent) which word is <HI>believed with the heart,</HI> and then <HI>confe&s;&s;ed with the mouth.</HI> And the&s;e only are God's people in a go&s;pel &s;en&s;e. Upon this the eleventh chapter begins with this ob|jection, <HI>Hath God ca&s;t away his people?</HI> In an&s;wer to which the apo&s;tle &s;hews that he and a number more of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s natural &s;eed, were not ca&s;t away; even a <HI>remnant according to the election of grace; and if by grace, then</HI> it is <HI>no more of works: Otherwi&s;e grace is no more grace.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>F.</HI> will agree with me, that the be|lieving Gentiles were graffed in among <HI>&s;piritual I&s;rael,</HI> and yet he would bring his <HI>natural</HI> offspring in with him; but what the apo&s;tle here &s;ays of grace and works, is as true of fle&s;h and &s;pirit; they are di&s;tinct, and ought never to be confounded together: Yet &s;ince they are in this ca&s;e, I would ob&s;erve that the prie&s;t|hood
<PB N="58" REF="011557_0057_0F8720DC93F6C378">was as expre&s;ly given to <HI>Aaron</HI>'s po&s;terity by an <HI>everla&s;ting covenant,</HI> Num. 25.13. as ever church-member&s;hip was to <HI>Abraham</HI>'s &s;eed; yea much more &s;trictly; for none but <HI>Aaron</HI>'s lawful &s;eed might ever mini&s;ter in the prie&s;ts office in that church, and the &s;tranger that came nigh was to be put to death, Num. 18.7. while &s;trangers were freely admitted into <HI>Abra|ham</HI>'s covenant: And why is not <HI>Aaron</HI>'s everla&s;ting covenant regarded as much as <HI>Abraham</HI>'s? And tho&s;e mini&s;ters who often tell us of <HI>David</HI>'s error in not having the ark carried upon the prie&s;ts &s;houlders, which they de&s;ign as a warning again&s;t any per&s;ons preach|ing that they have not approbated, how dare they introduce any into the mini&s;try who are not mini&s;ters natural &s;eed? If they &s;ay, <HI>Aaron</HI> was a type of Chri&s;t, and his children a type of the &s;aints; we readily grant it: And mini&s;ters, in di&s;tinction from other &s;aints, are never called prie&s;ts in the new te&s;tament; therefore how dare they attempt to take the ark from the&s;e prie&s;ts &s;houlders, who are the <HI>pillar and ground of the truth,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.15. and a&s;&s;ume it to them&s;elves?&mdash; This leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="4">IV. I cannot join with Mr. <HI>F.</HI> in his way of con|&s;truing the new te&s;tament by the old, becau&s;e it opens a door for the greate&s;t part of the <HI>&s;uper&s;titions</HI> and abominations that have ever been impo&s;ed upon the chri&s;tian church. When we interpret the old te&s;ta|ment by the new, then it appears plain that all tho&s;e covenants which included the children with their fathers, were figures of the great Head of the church and his members: And that &s;ince he is come, tho&s;e covenants as well as ordinances are done away. But when men turned to interpreting the new te&s;tament by the old, then they mu&s;t have a <HI>Pope</HI> to an&s;wer to the high prie&s;t; and as go&s;pel privileges are al|lowed to be greater than tho&s;e of the <HI>Jews,</HI> they
<PB N="59" REF="011557_0058_0F8720DD5AE095B0">mu&s;t have more orders of office than the prie&s;ts had, with <HI>&s;urplices</HI> in&s;tead of their <HI>ephods;</HI> yea <HI>tythes,</HI> and what not? And as the prie&s;ts &s;entence decided abundance of ca&s;es in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church, what pleas have been made from thence for the pope's power, and for mini&s;terial authority, to the depriving of the &s;aints of their precious right of judging for them&s;elves in religion, in&s;tead of allowing the government of the church now, to be in this <HI>holy prie&s;thood?</HI> 1 Pet. 2.5.</P>
<P>He before whom all things are naked and opened, gave early warning again&s;t the&s;e &s;nares, and not only told his people that the <HI>covenant</HI> which literal <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;tood in was <HI>old,</HI> and ready to <HI>vani&s;h away;</HI> but al&s;o that Je&s;us has <HI>blotted out</HI> that <HI>hand-writing of ordinan|ces,</HI> and taken it out of the way, <HI>nailing it to his cro&s;s:</HI> And this he gives as a caution not to let <HI>philo&s;ophers judge them,</HI> nor with their <HI>vain deceit</HI> introduce <HI>ordi|nances</HI> among them after the <HI>commandments and doct|rines of men,</HI> Col. 2.8, 14, 16, 20.</P>
<P>Another pernicious effect of this way of con&s;truing &s;cripture, is the breaking down the walls of Chri&s;t's vineyard, and laying it as an open field, &s;o that all &s;orts of per&s;ons may come to the Lord's table, almo&s;t without di&s;tinction. This evil in the national church was a principal cau&s;e of our fathers leaving it, and com|ing to this country. And they held &s;trictly that none ought to be received into the church, without a decla|ration of a work of grace in their hearts; and that none but &s;uch might bring their children to bapti&s;m, till tho&s;e children began to have families. Then came on a trial concerning what &s;hould be done with their infants; and Mr. <HI>Henry Dun&s;tar,</HI> pre&s;ident of <HI>Harvard</HI> college, (&s;oon after he had fini&s;hed that ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms which has been u&s;ed in <HI>New-England</HI> ever &s;ince) was convinced &s;o that he <Q>thought him&s;elf under &s;ome
<PB N="60" REF="011557_0059_0F8720DE15C35D88">obligation to bear his te&s;timony in &s;ome &s;ermons, a|gain&s;t the admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m to any infant what&s;oever. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mitchel</HI>'s life, p. 67.</NOTE></Q> And Mr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> pa&s;tor of the church in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> was by his means brought to great &s;cruples of infant-bapti&s;m, yet he &s;oon concluded they were from the <HI>evil one,</HI> and to guard again&s;t them &s;ays, <Q>I re&s;olved on Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI>'s principle, that I would have an argument able to remove a mountain before I would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> from a truth or practice re|ceived among the faithful. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p 70.</NOTE></Q> And having <HI>re&s;olved</HI> and prayed and &s;trove again&s;t them for nine years, he got furni&s;hed &s;o, that the author of his life informs us, that the determination of the point, in the Synod of 1662, about per&s;ons owning the covenant and bringing their children, <Q>Was more owing to him than to any one man in the world.</Q> And the ground he intro|duced them upon was that, <Q>If the parent be in the vi&s;ible church, his infant child is &s;o al&s;o.</Q> Yet whe|ther the&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould be baptized as in a <HI>catholic,</HI> or in a <HI>particular</HI> church &s;tate, this &s;ays he, <Q>Is ano|ther que&s;tion: And I confe&s;s my&s;elf not altogether &s;o peremptory,&mdash;as in the thing it&s;elf, viz. <HI>That they ought to be baptized.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pag. 78.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Thus the influence of tradition and a fond conceit of &s;ecuring religion to their po&s;terity, cau&s;ed &s;uch as were otherwi&s;e worthy men, to be <HI>peremptory</HI> in put|ting the badge of member&s;hip upon them, before they knew whether they were members of the univer&s;al church, or of a particular one; notwith&s;tanding they had declared a few years before, in the <HI>Cambridge</HI> plat|form, that the church under the go&s;pel is <HI>not national,</HI> but <HI>congregational.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> after this, took much pains to &s;hew that none ought to be received to full communion in the church, but &s;uch as gave an ac|count of a work of grace in their &s;ouls, and concluded
<PB N="61" REF="011557_0060_0F8720DED5E262F0">what he wrote on that &s;ubjuct with the&s;e words, viz. <Q>The power of godline&s;s will &s;oon be lo&s;t, if only doctrinal knowledge and outward blamele&s;sne&s;s be accounted &s;ufficient for all church privileges, and <HI>practical confe&s;&s;ions</HI> (or examinations of men's <HI>&s;piri|tual e&s;tate</HI>) be laid a&s;ide; for that which people &s;ee to be publicly required and held in reputation, that will they look after, and u&s;ually no more, but con|tent them&s;elves with <HI>that.</HI> Con&s;ider, if this hath not been a rea&s;on of the formality and deadne&s;s that have overgrown many churches.</Q> <HI>January</HI> 4. 1664.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mitchel</HI>'s life, p. 88.</NOTE></P>

<P>The&s;e things naturally tend as I &s;aid, to lay Chri&s;t's vineyard as an open field, and a great part of the mi|ni&s;ters of our land now apply to the <HI>church</HI> what he &s;aid of the <HI>world,</HI> in Matt. 13.30, 38.

Well what is this <HI>vi&s;ible &s;tanding</HI> which we have a right to judge of? Why he &s;ays, <Q>Then we have a <HI>&s;ure</HI> foundation to go upon, in determining who have a right to the &s;eals and who not, viz. &s;uch as are of <HI>&s;ound principles</HI> in the chri&s;tian faith, and <HI>morally &s;incere</HI> in their covenanting; this gives a right to all the &s;eals.</Q> P. 44. I wonder what Mr. <HI>B.</HI> thinks <HI>&s;ound principles,</HI> or <HI>moral &s;incerity</HI> is; whether &s;omething in|ward, or only an outward &s;hew! It makes me think of an affair that happened &s;ome years ago, not far from him: A man of note declared that a per&s;on might externally keep all the precepts of the moral law, out of regard to <HI>Molock;</HI> and when &s;everal things were &s;aid to expo&s;e the ab&s;urdity of this notion, it was objected that they did not take notice that he &s;aid, <HI>externally.</HI> Yes, &s;ays the other, I ob&s;erve he means that a per&s;on may love God with <HI>all his heart, externally!</HI>
<P>In reality it is quite as difficult to know when a per&s;on has moral &s;incerity, as &s;aving faith; one lies in conviction and re&s;traints upon the con&s;cience, the other is the love of the truth in the heart: And it often happens that when a per&s;on that has had &s;ome conviction, gets into the church, &s;o as to <HI>eat and drink</HI> in the divine pre&s;ence, he &s;hakes off his concern, and his <HI>la&s;t &s;tate is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.</HI></P></NOTE></Q> It &s;eems then accord|ing to him, that per&s;ons are e&s;pou&s;ed to Chri&s;t in in|fant-bapti&s;m, but not married to him till they make an open profe&s;&s;ion; yet then the tenor of their marriage covenant is, <HI>I will, if they will,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>I will, and they &s;hall,</HI> Heb. 8.10.

And the way that 'tis often co|vered, even from them&s;elves as well as others, is by the ambiguity of words. It was a &s;olemn demand which was made to <HI>Job,</HI> after his long di&s;pute with his friend, <Q>Who is this that <HI>darkneth coun&s;el</HI> with <HI>words</HI> without <HI>knowledge?</HI></Q> And it &s;urely calls for our &s;pecial notice in the pre&s;ent debate.

And I think his cen&s;ure is ju&s;t upon &s;uch conduct. <Q>One, &s;ays he, who &s;hould &s;peak thus in the affairs and bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, and call eight &s;ometimes &s;even, &s;ometimes nine, as be&s;t &s;erved his advantage, would pre&s;ently have clap'd upon him one of the two names men con&s;tantly are di&s;gu&s;ted with, (i. e. fool or knave); and yet in arguings and learned conte&s;ts, the &s;ame &s;ort of proceeding pa&s;&s;es commonly for wit and learning: But yet to me, it appears a grea|ter di&s;hone&s;ty, than the mi&s;placing of counters, in the ca&s;ting up a debt, and the cheat the greater, by how much truth is of greater concernment and va|lue than money <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on human under&s;tanding, B. III. chap. 10. S. 5.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Now let us &s;ee if we have not &s;omething of the &s;ame nature in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y. The words on which it chiefly turns, are, "The covenant of grace
<PB N="69" REF="011557_0068_0F8720ED16DE6E60">was made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> and believers are now in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> covenant," We readily grant that the convenant of grace was made known to him, and that he was &s;aved by faith, as &s;aints are now; but the covenant of circumci&s;ion, as it contained the con&s;titution and limits of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church, we cannot look upon to be the &s;ame that believers are in now. Well they allow &s;ome difference; for the <HI>Jews</HI> are broken off, and the Gen|tiles are graffed in, and have greater privileges. How? why tis &s;aid, Then the church was limited to one na|tion, now it is open for all believers to come in with their hou&s;holds. Yet when the matter is examined, they don't mean to have all the <HI>men</HI> of their hou&s;holds baptized as <HI>Abraham</HI>'s were circumci&s;ed, but only their <HI>infants;</HI> neither do they mean that every one of them <HI>when</HI> they have baptized them, &s;hall <HI>then</HI> eat the Lord's &s;upper, as all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did the pa&s;&s;over. So that they cannot hold the con&s;titution of the church to be the &s;ame; but <HI>con&s;titution</HI> is not a &s;criptural word, and they &s;till a&s;&s;ert that the covenant is the &s;ame as it was with <HI>Abraham;</HI> and when we bring <HI>Paul</HI>'s words, which &s;hew it is not the &s;ame, then we &s;tick to the letter, and tis declared that he does not mean two di&s;tinct covenants, only the &s;ame under two admini|&s;trations. Ju&s;t now the word <HI>con&s;titution</HI> was un&s;crip|tural, but now <HI>admini&s;tration</HI> mu&s;t come in to prove that <HI>Paul</HI> did not mean as he &s;aid!</P>
<P>Another turn for tho&s;e words in Heb. 8.9. is that the new covenant there means the internal efficacy of the covenant; as if it had no internal efficacy till that time: Whereas Rom. 4.11. &s;peaks plainly of its in|ward efficacy to <HI>Abraham;</HI> but they often attempt from that text to prove that the external covenant now is the &s;ame with the covenant of circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus we have a covenant that is the &s;ame, and not the &s;ame; larger than the covenant of circumci&s;ion,
<PB N="70" REF="011557_0069_0F8720EDD5D1FBB8">yet not &s;o large; a different admini&s;tration, yet they admini&s;ter ordinances to the &s;ame &s;ubjects,&mdash;believers and their hou&s;holds; though &s;till it is only to part of them, to wit, the infants therein. Upon another turn there is a great difference, for the old covenant was external, the new one is internal;&mdash;yet after all it is as external as the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> covenant was, and only has different ordinances, but the &s;ame &s;ubjects! I mu&s;t confe&s;s this makes me think of the bea&s;t which <HI>my&s;tery Babylon</HI> &s;at upon, which <HI>was, and is not, and yet is,</HI> Rev. 17.8. I read al&s;o in an ancient record that, <HI>her ways are moveable, that thou can&s;t not know them,</HI> Prov. 5.6. And does it not give us rea&s;on to think, this practice was derived from her, &s;ince it requires &s;uch <HI>movings</HI> and &s;hifting to &s;upport it?</P>
<P>The divine command is, <HI>Make &s;trait paths for your feet.</HI> Which if we obey, and come <HI>&s;trait</HI> up to the point, we may find that as bapti&s;m is an external ordi|nance of the go&s;pel church now, as circumci&s;ion was of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church formerly; and that neither of them were introduced by man's conjectures, but by expre&s;s command: So that the &s;ubjects of each are plainly expre&s;t in the command, and not left for men to find out by uncertain con&s;equences. The fir&s;t ad|mini&s;trator of bapti&s;m warned the <HI>Jews</HI> again&s;t think|ing to come to it with a plea that they had <HI>Abraham</HI> to their father; and when a complaint was made a|gain&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI> that he taught the <HI>Jews</HI> which were among the Gentiles to for&s;ake <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;aying, that they <HI>ought not to circumci&s;e their children, James</HI> &s;ays, <HI>As touch|ing the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded, that they ob&s;erve</HI> NO SUCH THINGS, Acts 21.25. Yet now a common pretence is, that we ought to <HI>ob&s;erve &s;uch things,</HI> as bringing children to the ordinance on their parents right; and they &s;ay, <Q>The patent &s;ealed by bapti&s;m is (&s;o to &s;peak) the very

<P>Is not this affair much like the <HI>Jews</HI> traditions, which the learned could not read in <HI>the book,</HI> becau&s;e it was &s;ealed; and the unlearned could not read it, becau&s;e he was <HI>not learned?</HI> Yet they propo&s;e a very good end in it, which is to keep their children in the <HI>fear of God.</HI> But we are a&s;&s;ured that it is <HI>in vain,</HI>&mdash;while this fear is <HI>taught by the precept of men.</HI> And as vain are their <HI>turning things up&s;ide down,</HI> and <HI>&s;eeking deep to hide their coun&s;el,</HI> I&s;a. 29.11,&mdash;16. Matt. 15.7,&mdash;9.</P>
<P>Here many will turn their addre&s;s to people's natu|ral pa&s;&s;ions, and a declaration that we condemn all our good fathers, and that we are cruel to our children, will often carry the point, even where &s;cripture and rea&s;on both fail them. Yet if we could hear our fa|thers, one of the mo&s;t eminent of them told his peo|ple when they were coming to this country, that <Q>It was not po&s;&s;ible the chri&s;tian world &s;hould come &s;o lately out of &s;uch antichri&s;tian darkne&s;s, and that full perfection of knowledge &s;hould break forth at once.</Q> Therefore he charged them before God and his ble&s;&s;ed angels, to follow him, <Q>No farther than he followed Chri&s;t;</Q> but to act according to their covenant, wherein they, <Q>engaged with God and one another, to receive whatever light or truth &s;hould be made known to them from his written word. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Prince</HI>'s chronology, p. 89, 90.</NOTE></Q> What an abu&s;e then is it of mankind, to bring the name of our good fathers to hinder our acting agreeable to their covenant with God, &amp; their &s;olemn charge to us!

<P N="1">1. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> &s;ays, <Q>I think it is beyond them to make their practice con&s;i&s;tent, in denying infants right to bapti&s;m, becau&s;e the letter does not &s;hew where an infant was baptized; and yet at the &s;ame time keep the fir&s;t day as a &s;abbath, when the latter duty is far le&s;s plain than the former.</Q> P. 4.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="011557_0073_0F8720F23AF9CB28">
Let us try the point. If it is a&s;ked why we keep the fir&s;t day? We can &s;hew that Je&s;us aro&s;e on that day, and as the Fathers re&s;ting from the works of creation, is given as a rea&s;on why the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;hould keep the &s;eventh day; &s;o the SON's re&s;ting from the works of redemption appears a rea&s;on why we &s;hould keep the fir&s;t day. Hence when the Apo&s;tle is open|ing the difference between the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> and chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ations, he &s;ays, <HI>There remaineth therefore a re&s;t</HI> (or keeping of a <HI>&s;abbath,</HI> as the margin reads it) <HI>to the people of God: For</HI> HE <HI>that is entered into his re&s;t, hath cea&s;ed from his own works,</HI> AS GOD <HI>did from his,</HI> Heb. 4.9, 10.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Should any &s;ay that this text has no reference to any parti|cular day, but only to &s;piritual re&s;t. I an&s;wer, that bapti&s;m and the &s;upper have reference to &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, yet that is far from rendering the literal ob&s;ervation of them u&s;ele&s;s: So I look upon the ca&s;e here. God &s;aid of <HI>I&s;rael. I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a &s;ign between me and them,</HI> Ezek. 20.12. And a change from the &s;eventh to the fir&s;t day, &s;eems to be a &s;ign of the difference between the two covenants, for as one required our work before the reward; &s;o the other gives the &s;oul <HI>re&s;t</HI> in Chri&s;t, in order to work for his glory.</NOTE> And we have expre&s;s examples of the Apo&s;tles and others meeting on that day for wor&s;hip, to break bread, and to offer their liberality, John 20.19, 26. Acts 20.7.1 Cor. 16.2. And when the apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> would let the churches know when he had his fir&s;t vi&s;ion in <HI>Patmos,</HI> he tells them it was on the <HI>Lord's day,</HI> Rev. 1.10. As to the &s;tupid cant of &s;ome, that, Every day is the Lord's:&mdash; It is as true that every table, and every &s;upper is al&s;o his; but what mockery would it make of the bible, to &s;ay when it &s;peaks of the <HI>Lord's-table,</HI> and the <HI>Lord's-&s;upper,</HI> that it means no more than every table, and every &s;upper! 1 Cor. 10.21. and 11.20. No, &s;eri|ous minds give in that it means a table and &s;upper, which is &s;et apart from a common to a &s;acred u&s;e,
<PB N="75" REF="011557_0074_0F8720F30ED6DBD0">as an ordinance of divine wor&s;hip. So we take the <HI>Lord's-day</HI> to mean this day as &s;et apart from other days for his wor&s;hip, and known by that name a|mong the churches to which <HI>John</HI> wrote.</P>
<P>What a bias of mind then is di&s;covered, in &s;aying that this duty is, "Far le&s;s plain," than infant-bapti&s;m, of which we have neither precept nor example in all the bible! Nay, I mu&s;t turn the argument, and ob&s;erve, that the apo&s;tle names the <HI>jewi&s;h &s;abbath-days,</HI> as well as <HI>circumci&s;ion,</HI> among the <HI>hand writing of ordinances,</HI> which Chri&s;t has <HI>blotted out,</HI> Col. 2.11, 13, 10. And if infant-bapu&s;m is held from thence, why not the &s;eventh day al&s;o?</P>
<P N="2">2. Mr <HI>F.</HI> &s;ays, <Q>I look upon the bapti&s;t brethren incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, for rejecting infants from being &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, becau&s;e the letter does not &s;hew where an infant was baptized; and at the &s;ame time will not allow any per&s;on to be baptized, unle&s;s put all under water, when the letter no where &s;hews that a per&s;on was put under water in all the bible.</Q> P. 34. Here let the reader re|member how far I have concur'd with him in the be|ginning about the letter: This being ob&s;erved, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent only fix upon one point, which is, that <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays in one place, we are <HI>buried by bapti&s;m,</HI> and in a|nother that we are <HI>buried in bapti&s;m,</HI> Rom. 6.4. Col. 2.12. And among all the critics upon our tran&s;la|tion, I never knew any object again&s;t the tran&s;lation of the&s;e words, neither do we differ about the meaning of the word <HI>buried:</HI> All the di&s;pute is concerning what is here intended by bapti&s;m. The word is u&s;ed in the &s;cripture, for an ordinance in the church, for a work of the &s;pirit, and for &s;ufferings. Well let wa|ter, &s;pirit, or troubles be intended here, yet &s;till the word is expre&s;s, we are <HI>buried by it,&mdash;buried in it.</HI> So that let men go to which they will to find out the
<PB N="76" REF="011557_0075_0F8720F4E5BB0AD8">meaning of the word, &s;till it is <HI>burying;</HI> and unle&s;s they can make out that to be <HI>buried</HI> is not to be <HI>co|vered,</HI> they mu&s;t know, that to be baptized with wa|ter, is to be covered with water.</P>
<P>Our author inclines to the old ab&s;urdity, of running to places where the word bapti&s;m is u&s;ed in a <HI>figurative</HI> way, to find out its <HI>literal</HI> meaning: But what work &s;hould we make if we &s;hould determine the full mean|ing of the word <HI>thief,</HI> by Rev. 16.15! He tells us of God's <Q>pouring out his &s;pirit, and of raining down righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q> P. 34. So he does, and who does not know that waters which compo&s;e <HI>rivers</HI> were fir&s;t rained down from above? And the ble&s;&s;ings which flow from Chri&s;t are called, <HI>Rivers of water in a dry place.</HI> I&s;a. 32.2. And the account which divine in|&s;piration gives of the di&s;ciples being baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;ays, <HI>It filled all the hou&s;e</HI> where they were &s;itting:&mdash;And they were <HI>all filled</HI> with the Holy Gho&s;t, Acts 2.2, 4. So as to Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings which are called a bapti&s;m, we have &s;carce a clearer prophecy of them any where than in the 69th P&s;alm; and in that P&s;alm, the &s;ame per&s;on who &s;ays, <Q>They gave me gall for my meat, and in my thir&s;t they gave me vinegar to drink;</Q> al&s;o &s;ays, <Q>I am come into <HI>deep waters,</HI> where the <HI>floods overflow me,</HI></Q> ver. 2, 21. How plainly do all the&s;e carry the idea of immer&s;ion in the meaning of the word? Mr. <HI>F.</HI> cites a great number of texts, in order to prove that &s;prink|ling, and wa&s;hing or bathing, mean the &s;ame thing; but they are far from an&s;wering his de&s;ign. For in|&s;tance, in Num. 19, 18. to <HI>dip</HI> and to <HI>&s;prinkle,</HI> plainly convey two ideas, as di&s;tinct from each other as the words are; and &s;o does <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> and <HI>bathing</HI> in the next ver&s;e. And in the epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> where the de&s;ign of the&s;e ceremonies is explained, it appears that <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> referred to the removal of guilt, and
<PB N="77" REF="011557_0076_0F8720F557B51F50"><HI>wa&s;hing</HI> or <HI>bathing,</HI> to the taking away the filth of &s;in; or in other words, the fir&s;t referred to ju&s;tificati|on, the other to &s;anctification. The <HI>&s;prinkling of blood</HI> protected from the &s;troke of vengeance, and <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> the <HI>con&s;cience</HI> removes its guilt; but having our <HI>bodies</HI> (or whole man) <HI>wa&s;hed with pure water,</HI> is al&s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to <HI>draw near to God</HI> in <HI>his hou&s;e.</HI> Heb. 10.21, 22. and 11.28. Now &s;ince all allow that Rom. 6.4. &s;ignifies our obligation to die to &s;in, and to walk in newne&s;s of life; which is as much as to own that it &s;ignifies our &s;anctification, why are they &s;o fond of a mode which typified ju&s;tification, unle&s;s they mean to confound them together, as too many do? It was not <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s holine&s;s or good works that &s;ecured them from the de&s;troying angels &s;troke, but it was the <HI>&s;prink|ling of blood,</HI> which pointed directly to <HI>Chri&s;t our pa&s;&s;|over</HI> who is <HI>&s;acrificed for us,</HI> 1 Cor. 5.7.</P>
<P>And &s;ince we are &s;o often refer'd to the bapti&s;m of the &s;pirit, let it be noted that it is only an extraordi|nary degree of it which is called a bapti&s;m. The di&s;|ciples &s;urely had a mea&s;ure of it when they were con|verted, and when Je&s;us appeared to them after his re|&s;urrection, he breathed on them and &s;aid, <HI>Receive ye the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> John 20.22. Yet all this is not called a bapti&s;m; but on the day of his a&s;cention he command|ed them to wait at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> for that promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing, <HI>For,</HI> &s;aid he, John <HI>truly bapti&s;ed with water; but ye &s;hall be baptized with the holy Gho&s;t, not many days hence,</HI> Acts 1.5. Al&s;o let it be ob&s;erved that we are often referred to the bapti&s;m of the Spirit, in order to find the meaning of the word, which they &s;ay is by &s;prinkling or pouring; yet when we come to Rom. 6.4. they would have it, that <HI>burying</HI> there has no re|ference to literal, but to &s;piritual bapti&s;m. Thus again their ways are <HI>moveable,</HI> and not <HI>&s;trait paths.</HI> I leave it therefore to the readers judgment, who are con|fu&s;ed
<PB N="78" REF="011557_0077_0F8720FCAFA50198">and &s;uper&s;titious about the mode, p. 31. either tho&s;e who hold that we are <HI>buried</HI> in bapti&s;m, or tho&s;e who &s;ay tis as well to be <HI>&s;prinkled,</HI> without being able to produce one text in the bible where that word is applied to bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>To &s;um up all, I think I have made it appear that Mr. <HI>F.</HI> is not ju&s;t in charging us with &s;ticking to the letter, &s;o as not to regard the nature of God's will contained therein, and have &s;hewn that we regard the "divine <HI>harmony</HI> of the &s;criptures," which he holds to be a &s;ure token that we under&s;tand them right. And I leave it to be con&s;idered, whether he has not been taken in both of the &s;nares which he cautioned o|thers again&s;t: That is, whether his imagination has not been &s;o elevated with <HI>hou&s;holds</HI> being in covenant, while at the &s;ame time he &s;ticks &s;o clo&s;e to the letter of the words, <HI>To thee and to thy &s;eed,</HI>&mdash;as to mi&s;take what the divine will is therein. The main body of his di&s;cour&s;e is taken up in proving that the ble&s;&s;ings of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">: were di&s;covered to <HI>Abraham,</HI> which no body will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">; but what is that to his purpo&s;e, &s;o long as it appears that all tho&s;e covenants that included parents was their children, were in that re&s;pect figurative of Chri&s;t and his &s;aints? Yea <HI>Adam,</HI> as he &s;tood the covenant nead of his po&s;terity, was a <HI>figure of Him that was to come,</HI> Rom. 5.14. Therefore if the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e &s;hadows is come, how can the external covenant be the &s;ame? And if he &s;till thinks it is, then I de&s;ire he would &s;hew why <HI>Aaron</HI>'s covenant does not entail the mini&s;try to a natural line, as much as <HI>Abraham</HI>'s can church-member&s;hip, or a right to ordinances.</P>
<P>He frequently charges us with antinomini&s;m, yet all the colour of proof that our principles have any tendency that way, that I can find from him, lies in three things. 1. He &s;ays, if the holine&s;s in Cor. 7. 14. <Q>Re&s;pects not &s;omething of a religious right, or
<PB N="79" REF="011557_0078_0F8720FE8F249640">what is &s;acred, then I grant, it means as the bapti&s;ts &s;ay; and the con&s;equence I think cannot be avoided, that all children that are not begotten &s;o faith, or in the new covenant, mu&s;t be ba&s;tards: A rank anti|nomian principle, again&s;t the light of nature!</Q> P. 24. This is notable rea&s;oning! It is as much as to &s;ay, <Q>becau&s;e we hold, that a man's being brought into the faith no ways di&s;&s;olves his former marriage, that therefore the unavoidable con&s;equence is, that his chil|dren which he had then are illegitimate!</Q> Rather is nor the conclu&s;ion plain in the text, that if the co|habiting as man and wife were not warranted by the law of Chri&s;t, then their children mu&s;t be unclean in our &s;en&s;e of the word? Here al&s;o we have another in|&s;tance of the <HI>moveable ways</HI> of our opponents; for they all own that this text &s;hews that the ceremonial law (by which the <HI>Jews wives and &s;uch as were born of them,</HI> were <HI>put away, Ezra.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">0.3.) is not now in force; and they take the &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>&s;anctified,</HI> as we do, from the go&s;pel, 1 Tim. 4 3&mdash;5. Yet they turn directly back, and take their &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>holy</HI> from the ceremonial law, which is out of date: And call us antinomians, becau&s;e we will not go in the&s;e <HI>crooked ways</HI> with them!</P>
<P N="2">2. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> in&s;inuates that our doing what he calls re|baptizing, leads to antinomiani&s;m, p. 4, 5. He calls it a devouring that which is holy: But if a &s;oul is con|vinced that infant-&s;prinkling has no warrant from the bible, what crime can it be to leave it, and practice what is plainly commanded therein? Yea, he allows &s;uch acting to be right; but pre&s;umes to a&s;&s;ert that we do not act &s;o. P. 30. However, as long as we know that we do, his cen&s;ure will not move us; unle&s;s it be with pity for his ra&s;hne&s;s. A third thing that he repeatedly brings, is, that &s;ome per&s;ons of our denomination have run into antinomian errors; which, unle&s;s he had prov|ed
<PB N="80" REF="011557_0079_0F8721005DF1E8A8">that our principles had a tendency that way, is a|bout as good rea&s;oning, as it is for an infidel to bring <HI>Judas</HI> and <HI>Simon Magus</HI> to prove chri&s;tianity to be a delu&s;ion. And &s;ince Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has declared his intention of enlarging upon that &s;ubject, if I publi&s;h my an&s;wer to him; I &s;hall only de&s;ire him to take his late book, and turn to what he has wrote concerning the like treat|ment, which he and his brethren have received from tho&s;e called &s;tanding mini&s;ters; where he ju&s;tly ob&s;erves that he and his brethren, <Q>are no more to account for tho&s;e out of covenant, than the &s;tanding mini&s;ters are for every corrupt, profane, immoral per&s;on, that waits upon their mini&s;try.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Key, p. 29. 35.</NOTE></Q> And if he acts accord|ing to his own rule, I am not afraid of his hurting us; and if he acts contrary thereto, he will only expo&s;e him|&s;elf in trying to expo&s;e others.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e what I have now wrote, together with the foregoing &s;ermon, may &s;erve as a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to what Mr. <HI>Frothingham</HI> has printed on the &s;ubject; and &s;hall only add, that in a letter to me, he &s;ays, <Q>You may remember, brother, that &s;ome years back we &s;tood in union together in the &s;pirit and practice of the go&s;pel, and now it is broke, thro' your practice.</Q> On which I would ob&s;erve, that he knows our covenant (like that of our fathers) was, <Q>Still to be looking for more light from God, which is contained in the &s;acred &s;criptures.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">His di&s;cour&s;e on the churches privileges, 1750. p. 19.</NOTE></Q> Which covenant I con&s;cientiou&s;ly ad|here to unto this day, though I have been har&s;hly treated by many therefor.</P>
<P>This brings to mind what I met with in a late jour|ney into the northern part of our country. A learned mini&s;ter of the common denomination, had challenged a public di&s;pute about bapti&s;m, which, as the ca&s;e hap|pened, I could not fairly avoid accepting. It was
<PB N="81" REF="011557_0080_0F8721009CFD3420">held in his own pulpit on <HI>October</HI> 30. 1769, before a con&s;iderable congregation. We were favoured &s;o as not to have an angry word, that I know of, on either &s;ide; yet near the clo&s;e of above five hours di&s;pute, he charged us with want of <HI>charity;</HI> and &s;aid they could have charity for us, if we would for them. I told him, charity was love, and we de&s;ired to exerci&s;e love towards all, according to their different circum&s;tances; but as to the extending of chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip, the apo|&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Charity rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth:</HI> And ju&s;t &s;o far as we can unite in any &s;piritual exerci&s;e in the truth, with any per&s;ons we de|&s;ired to do it, and no farther. And as all who hold to the external u&s;e of the ordinances, agree that per|&s;ons ought to be baptized before they come to the or|dinance of the &s;upper; therefore we are no more rigid than they, in refu&s;ing to partake of that ordi|nance with unbaptized per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Soon after this he &s;hut up his books, and gave a &s;pecimen of his <HI>charity</HI> before all the people; for many of them expected, as he had prayed at the beginning, that he would give me the &s;ame liberty in the conclu&s;ion; but in&s;tead of that, after a little pau&s;e, he made a motion for me to go out, and the a&s;&s;embly di&s;per&s;ed without any &s;ocial wor&s;hip at all. This looks &s;omething like what I heard an aged fa|ther &s;ay &s;ome years ago, to wit, That many when they preach up charity and a catholic &s;pirit, only mean to have others drop their different &s;entiments and come in and join with them; but where is the man upon earth, who will not allow as much liberty as that?</P>
<P>I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn that our fathers and bre|thren on Mr. <HI>Frothingham</HI>'s &s;ide, fir&s;t broke the uni|on between us;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> p. 118, 119.</NOTE> and I could ea&s;ily &s;hew how it
<PB N="82" REF="011557_0081_0F872101599D28D0">appears that many of them are the mo&s;t rigid unto this day, but as it is an unplea&s;ant ta&s;k, I chu&s;e to omit it. We are all in danger of a party &s;pirit, which we ought to be on a &s;trict watch again&s;t, on all hands. Some accu&s;e us with not allowing them to be vi&s;ible chri&s;tians, becau&s;e we do not hold them to be truly baptized; but what a &s;trange mi&s;take is that? When the point we contend for is, that bap|ti&s;m &s;hould be admini&s;tred to none but vi&s;ible chri|&s;tians, &s;o that if they are not &s;uch before bapti&s;m, they cannot be baptized at all.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with the words of a late worthy author, who &s;ays, <Q>Why do I trouble the reader about the communion of &s;aints, in this or the other particular form? We are fallen in a day when many devoutly di&s;claim it. It is now very common to make light of ordinances, and even for &s;erious per|&s;ons to talk as if they valued them&s;elves on being of no denomination of chri&s;tians; if a man, &s;ay they, loves Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or a preacher &s;ets forth the mercy of the Father in him, we have no concern about his form of religion; yet they cry up the martyrs, many of whom might have &s;aved their trea&s;ure and blood, had they made no con&s;cience of the authority of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e. The upright will deprecate a meer name, under any form, however agreable to the dictates of &s;cripture, but if a man intends by his being of no denomination, that he regards not the <HI>manner of &s;ervice</HI> appointed by the Lord; where is his religion?&mdash;If Chri&s;t is preached, and the power of godline&s;s prevails, by whom&s;oever, or whatever particular form of profe&s;&s;ion, his mini&s;ters and people rejoice; yet, if judicious; not &s;o but that wherein a man appears defective, in any doctrine of the go&s;pel, or article of in&s;tituted wor&s;hip, they mu&s;t wi&s;h him to know the way of the Lord more

D.</Q> And I think I can heartily recommend this latter for doctrinal, the other for practical divinity, as being as excel|lent compo&s;ures on tho&s;e &s;ubjects as any human writings that I have &s;een; and wi&s;h they may &s;pread much in this country.
<P>They were both printed la&s;t year in <HI>London,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Freeman</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> has a few of them to di&s;po&s;e of. Dr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s work contains 1091 pages in large quarto, at 36&s;. lawful money, if bound in two parts, or 34&s;. bound in one. Mr. <HI>Wallin</HI>'s lectures contain 507 pages in hand&s;ome octavo, at 8&s;.</P></NOTE></Q></P>
