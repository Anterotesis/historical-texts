<P>_IF the divine <HI>Conduct</HI> towards the in+tellectual Sy&s;tem can be <HI>vindicated</HI> there will be no Room for any <HI>Di&s;pute</HI> about his <HI>Decrees.</HI> If God always <HI>does</HI> what is <HI>be&s;t</HI> for him to do, his <HI>decree+ing</HI> from Eternity to do &s;o, cannot be ob+jected again&s;t: Unle&s;s we can &s;uppo&s;e it to be <HI>wrong,</HI> for God to <HI>determine</HI> upon a <HI>Conduct</HI> in all Re&s;pects <HI>right.</HI>&mdash;All God's Decrees primarily re&s;pect his own Con|duct. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> what a World to create. <HI>Secondly,</HI> how to be have towards his Crea+tures, in every particular Circum&s;tance For, "God executeth his Decrees in the Works of Creation and Providence."&mdash; The whole of the divine Conduct towards <HI>intelligent</HI> Beings, after they are brought into Exi&s;tence, may be arranged under the&s;e two general Heads.

<HEAD><HI>A VINDICATION Of</HI> the Wi&s;dom of God in the Per|mi&s;&s;ion of Sin.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT God permits Sin, is plain Fact, cannot admit of Di&s;pute, and needs no Proof. Or if any &s;hould be &s;o weak as to deny the Fact, it may be ea&s;ily proved. For all acknow|ledge that Sin is in the World; but if God had interpo&s;ed, and effectually hindered its ever coming into the World, it never would have been. That he did not interpo&s;e and effectually hinder it, is therefore as certain, as that Sin is now in the World. And God's <HI>not hindering</HI> Sin, is what I call his <HI>permitting it.</HI>&mdash;And this Fact, <HI>that God permits Sin,</HI> gives Ri&s;e to this Que&s;tion, viz. <HI>Is it wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t, that God &s;hould conduct as he does in this Affair?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="008541_0009_102F68278B6DA8C0">HAD we a comprehen&s;ive View of God's uni|ver&s;al Plan, and a perfectly holy Ta&s;te, the whole of the divine Conduct towards the intellectual Sy&s;tem, of Cour&s;e, mu&s;t appear to us now in this World, perfect in Wi&s;dom, Glory &amp; Beauty; as, it is acknowledged, it will, to all holy Beings at the Day of Judgment. But as the evil and dreadful Con&s;equences of Sin to us at pre&s;ent engro&s;s our Attention, and the Good to be bro't out of Evil, how great &s;oever it may be, is al|mo&s;t entirely out of Sight, to be &s;ure, to the Generality of Men; and not at all &s;uited to plea&s;e a vicious Ta&s;te, were it in ever &s;o clear View; it is no wonder if it be very difficult to bring a guilty apo&s;tate World to think well of the divine Conduct in this Affair. And yet if we once conclude, that the holy One of I&s;rael has not done what is mo&s;t for his own Glory, nor what was wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t to do; we mu&s;t inevitably give up the ab&s;olute Perfection of the divine Nature,&mdash;which will overturn all Religion by the Roots.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, <Q>that <HI>&s;ecret Things belong to God,</HI> and we ought not to think of this Part of the di|vine Conduct; nor is it our Duty to believe it to be wi&s;e, or to acquie&s;ce in it, as &s;uch;</Q> will not &s;atisfy a pious, judicious Mind. In|deed, were it a <HI>&s;ecret Thing,</HI> and had we no Evi|dence of the Fact, it might ju&s;tly put an End to all our Enquiries. But God's permitting Sin is in Truth <HI>no &s;ecret Thing.</HI> It is <HI>revealed,</HI> it is as open and manife&s;t as that God made and go|verns the World. It is often, very often held
<PB N="3" REF="008541_0010_102F68290DD7A7C8">
up to our View in the holy Scriptures, by God him&s;elf, on Purpo&s;e that we might think of it. And it is acknowledged on all Hands, that it is our Duty to <HI>&s;earch the Scriptures,</HI> and take &s;pe|cial Notice of what we find written there, and meditate on every Part of the divine Conduct therein held forth to our View; &s;ince the whole is calculated and de&s;igned for our In&s;truction. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> &mdash;And as it is an acknowledged Fact, that God has permitted Sin in Millions of In&s;tances, from the Beginning of the World to this Day, and will continue to do &s;o thr&ocirc; eternal Ages; &s;o there is no avoiding a View of his Conduct, but by the greate&s;t Stupidity, or &s;hut|ting our Eyes in the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate Manner.&mdash; Nay, this will not do it; we cannot but think of it &s;ometimes in this World, and &s;hall for ever think of it in the World to come. And we mu&s;t approve or di&s;approve; for it is &s;o inte|re&s;ting an Affair, that we cannot &s;tand Neuter. If we di&s;approve now, and for ever; we cannot acquie&s;ce in God's Ways in this World, nor join the heavenly Ho&s;ts at the Day of Judgment, in &s;aying, <HI>Amen, Hallelujah!</HI> And God, of Nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t look upon us as Enemies to him, and Male-Contents in his Kingdom, and treat us ac|cordingly. It is therefore of the la&s;t Importance that we approve.&mdash;But if God's Conduct is not wi&s;e, it is not our Duty to approve of it. Ra|ther we ought to be &s;orry, and lament, that God has done as he has: Which would &s;uppo&s;e him to be to Blame: Which would imply that he is not an ab&s;olutely perfect Being. And if
<PB N="4" REF="008541_0011_102F682AD82D7400">
&s;o, he is not God. And if there is no God, all Religion is overthrown. Therefore we mu&s;t believe the divine Conduct to be wi&s;e.&mdash;But how &s;hall this Belief be obtained?&mdash;<HI>Fir&s;tly</HI> and <HI>chiefly</HI> by an implicit Faith in the ab&s;olute Per|fection of the divine Nature.&mdash;Which&mdash;<HI>Secondly,</HI> may be &s;trengthned, by a View of the Wi&s;dom of &s;uch Parts of the divine Conduct as we can more fully comprehend.&mdash;Which&mdash;<HI>Thirdly,</HI> may be &s;till more confirmed by right Views of the true Nature of God's univer&s;al Plan.&mdash;All the&s;e I have endeavoured to lead my Readers to attend unto, in my <HI>Sermons</HI> on <HI>the Wi&s;dom of God in the Permi&s;&s;ion of Sin.</HI></P>
<P>AND had the Author of the <HI>Attempt</HI> carefully attended to the Subject, as I had &s;tated it, and entered thoroughly into my Rea&s;onings, I &s;hould naturally have been led to review the whole, and to retract or confirm, as Light and Truth ap|peared.&mdash;But this he has not done; but rather, to u&s;e his own Words, according to his pro|fe&s;&s;ed De&s;ign, he has exerted him&s;elf to the ut|mo&s;t to &s;et out the Doctrine, "if po&s;&s;ible, in all its Horror &amp; Deformity." (p. 8.) So that what I have to do, is to take off this <HI>ill Dre&s;s,</HI> and array it in its <HI>native Beauty;</HI> that the divine Conduct in the Permi&s;&s;ion of Sin may not be bla&s;phemed by ignorant and wicked Men thr&ocirc; his Means; and the moral Rectitude of the di|vine Nature given up, to the Subver&s;ion of all Religion. Nor &s;hall any thing in his Piece that needs an An&s;wer, pa&s;s uncon&s;idered.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Several Particulars, wherein the Author of the <HI>SERMONS</HI> on the Wi&s;dom of God in the Per|mi&s;&s;ion of Sin, and the Author of the <HI>ATTEMPT,</HI> are agreed.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hould always exactly &s;tate the Point in Controver&s;y before we begin to di&s;pute. Wherefore let us &s;ee how far this Author agrees with us; that the Point of Difference may be made to &s;tand out in clear View.&mdash;And</P>
<P N="1">1. WE agree, that Sin is in the World, and that dreadful have been the Con&s;equences for above 5000 Years: And it is likely to i&s;&s;ue in the eternal Ruin of great Multitudes of God's Creatures.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE agree, that Sin is the very wor&s;t of Evils in its own Nature, and it naturally tends to evil, and only to evil; to di&s;honor God, and ruin the Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE agree, that the eternal Ruin of &s;uch great Multitudes of God's Creatures, con&s;ider'd in it's &s;elf, is an infinitely dreadful Thing.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE agree, that all the Sin and Mi&s;ery, that has, or ever will take Place in the Sy&s;tem thr&ocirc; eternal Ages (how infinitely dreadful &s;oever the whole mu&s;t appear to one who has a perfect comprehen&s;ive View of it all at once) even the whole lay open, full and plain to the divine View, before God created the World. And that he had as full, perfect and lively an Apprehen&s;ion of it, before he began to create, as he ever will have to eternal Ages.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="6" REF="008541_0013_102F68330920E230">5. WE agree, that, if God had plea&s;ed, he could have hindered the Exi&s;tence of Sin, and cau&s;ed Mi&s;ery to have been forever unknown in his Dominions, with as much Ea&s;e, as to have &s;uffered Things to take their pre&s;ent Cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. WE agree, that God knew with infallible Certainty, that Things would take their pre&s;ent Cour&s;e, and i&s;&s;ue as they will i&s;&s;ue, in the eter|nal Ruin of Millions, unle&s;s he him&s;elf &s;hould interpo&s;e, and effectually hinder it.</P>
<P N="7">7. WE agree, that God did, as it were, &s;tand by, and take a perfect View of the whole Chain of Events, in which his Honor &amp; the Good of his Creation was infinitely intere&s;ted: and in a full View, and under a mo&s;t lively Sen&s;e of the whole, did deliberately forbear to interpo&s;e effectually to hinder the Introduction of Sin into his World, when he could have hindered it, as ea&s;ily as not.</P>
<P N="8">8. WE agree, that Angels and Men were under the greate&s;t Obligations to love and obey God, and were left to their own free Choice: and that God was not obliged, in point of Ju&s;tice, to do any more for them than he did: And that the whole Blame lies at the Creatures Door: and that God is righteous in puni&s;hing his &s;in|ning Creatures, according to the Declarations of his Word.&mdash;All the&s;e Particulars I had a&s;|&s;erted:&mdash;None of them has he denied:&mdash;Nor does it appear that we differ in any of the&s;e Things.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> The grand Point in Controver&s;y exactly &s;tated.</HEAD>
<P>THE grand Point of Difference is preci&s;ely this&mdash;<Q>I believe that the infinitely holy and wi&s;e God, in every Part of his Conduct, relative to the intellectual Sy&s;tem, does that which is really wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t for him to do; mo&s;t for his Glory and the Good of the Sy&s;tem, in the whole; and therefore, that God's pre|&s;ent Plan is, of all po&s;&s;ible Plans, the be&s;t; mo&s;t for his Glory and the Good of the Sy&s;|tem.</Q>&mdash;On the Contrary, the Author of the <HI>Attempt</HI> believes, that <Q>God is not obliged to do, and that in fact he does not do, that which is mo&s;t for his own Glory, or mo&s;t for the Good of the Sy&s;tem; and is fully per&s;waded that the pre&s;ent Plan is &s;o far from being the be&s;t, that it had been infinitely more for the Glory of God, and Good of the Sy&s;tem, if Sin had never happened.</Q></P>
<P>IN the Sermons he objects again&s;t (p. 104, 105.) it had been &s;aid, that <Q>from the Perfections of the divine Nature alone, we have &s;uch full Evidence, that he mu&s;t always act in the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t Manner, as that we ought not in the lea&s;t to doubt it:&mdash;Before the Foundation of the World, this Sy&s;tem now in Exi&s;tence, and all other po&s;&s;ible Sy&s;tems, all equally lay open to the divine View, and one as ea&s;y to Almightine&s;s as another: He had his Choice; he had none to plea&s;e but him&s;elf: Be&s;ides

him there was no Being: he had a perfectly good Ta&s;te, and nothing to bias his Judg|ment, and was infinite in Wi&s;dom: This he cho&s;e: and this, of all po&s;&s;ible Sy&s;tems, there|fore was the be&s;t, infinite Wi&s;dom and perfect Rectitude being Judges.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the Author of the <HI>Attempt</HI> e&s;teems this Rea&s;oning quite inconclu&s;ive, as it proceeds on a fal&s;e Hypothe&s;is. "A Fallacy," he &s;ays, to &s;uppo&s;e that God "mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily always will and do that which is mo&s;t for his own Glory." A Point he does not believe, "that in fact he always does" or that "he is obliged to." He thinks it plain in the Works of Creation, that God has not done what would have been mo&s;t for his own Glory, and that he might have done much better. Which emboldens him to argue, that in the Works of Providence, he did not mean to do his be&s;t. (p. 12, 13.) And he attempts to prove at large by 9 Arguments, that it had been much better, in the whole, more for God's Glory and the general Good of the Sy&s;tem, if Sin and Mi&s;ery had been for ever unknown. (p. 20,&mdash; 24.)&mdash;And if it had been better for God to have hindered Sin, it was not wi&s;e in God to per|mit it.</P>
<P>SO that this is the fundamental and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Point of Difference, and that on which the whole Controver&s;y, between him and me, turns, <HI>viz. Whether the whole, and every Part of the divine Conduct, be agreable to infinite Wi&s;|dom.</HI>&mdash;Or, in other Words, <HI>Whether God means in the whole, and every Part of his Conduct, to do
<PB N="9" REF="008541_0016_102F683CB3E57238">
that which he knows to be for the be&s;t, mo&s;t for his Glory and the Good of the Sy&s;tem, on the whole.</HI>&mdash; For we both agree, that God always knows what is for the be&s;t, and never acts under Mi&s;take.&mdash; So that the only Que&s;tion really is, <HI>Whether God always means to do, what he knows to be for the be&s;t, in the whole?</HI>&mdash;For if he does, the grand Point is proved. The <HI>Wi&s;dom of God in the Per|mi&s;&s;ion of Sin</HI> is demon&s;trated.&mdash;And it is in vain to rai&s;e Objections again&s;t that which infinite Wi&s;dom knows to be be&s;t.&mdash;It is proud &amp; arro|gant, 'tis impious and bla&s;phemous, for a Worm of the Du&s;t to take up, and di&s;pute again&s;t his Maker. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> xlv. 9. <HI>Rom.</HI> ix. 20.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> God, who is a Being of infinite Wi&s;dom and perfect Rectitude, always conducts agreably to his own mo&s;t glorious Perfections; that is, in the mo&s;t wi&s;e, holy and perfect Manner. Particularly in this Ca&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>WE are agreed, that this Affair of the Per|mi&s;&s;ion of Sin was an infinitely important Affair. And, indeed, con&s;idering it in all its Con&s;equences; there, perhaps, never was a more important Affair, that God ever had to decide. It involved in it the Welfare of the angelic World, &amp; the Welfare of the whole human Race; the Honor of God was infinitely concerned in the Affair; yea, the very Life of God's own Son, did, as it were, lie at Stake: for if Sin was per|mitted,
<PB N="10" REF="008541_0017_102F683E36E26270">
the Son of God was to die. That if God ever thoroughly con&s;idered and weighed any Affair whatever, no doubt, he did this.&mdash; And if ever he was concerned to act according to his be&s;t Judgment (if I may be allowed to u&s;e &s;uch a Phra&s;e) in any one Ca&s;e, no doubt he was in this. And if God is an ab&s;olutely per|fect Being, it was &s;imply impo&s;&s;ible, that he &s;hould conduct, in this infinitely important Affair, contrary to the Light of his own Mind, and the joint Declaration of all his Perfections, infinitely to his own Di&s;honor, and infinitely to the Damage of the Sy&s;tem, ab&s;olutely without any Motive &s;o to do; yea, again&s;t infinite Motives to the Contrary. Nay, to &s;uppo&s;e, that God would deliberately and voluntarily, ab&s;olutely without any Motive, &s;uffer his Creatures, his <HI>own</HI> Crea|tures, to &s;in; when he knew it would be, in the whole, infinitely better for him to hinder it; is in the mo&s;t bare-faced Manner to give up the moral Rectitude of the divine Nature.</P>
<P>DID the Inhabitants of Heaven view the di|vine Conduct in the Permi&s;&s;ion of Sin, in this bla&s;phemous Light, and firmly believe God to be &s;uch a Being, in Stead of crying, <HI>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory,</HI> as they did when God gave up I&s;rael of old to Blindne&s;s of Mind and Hardne&s;s of Heart (<HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 6.) They would rather &s;ink down into amazing Grief, and fill all Heaven with loud Lamentations.</P>
<P>AND Saints on Earth, in Stead of &s;inging their ancient melodious Song, <HI>The Lord reigneth, let
<PB N="11" REF="008541_0018_102F683FCA4E7550">
the Earth rejoyce; let the Multitude of I&s;les be glad thereof;</HI> might rather, if the&s;e Things were &s;o, with the captive Jews, hang their Harps on the Willows, put on Sackcloth, &s;it down in Sorrow, and refu&s;e to be comforted.</P>
<P>A firm Belief of the infinite Wi&s;dom and per|fect Rectitude of the divine Nature and Govern|ment, is e&s;&s;ential to the very Foundation of all true Religion: For it is the very Rea&s;on of our Love to God, of our Joy in him, rejoycing in his univer&s;al Government, acquie&s;cing in all his Di&s;pen&s;ations, even tho&s;e which we cannot un|der&s;tand, and of our chearful Obedience to all his Commands. If therefore we give up this Belief, we mu&s;t give up all Religion: and &s;hall be in as bad or wor&s;e Condition than if we be|lieved there were really no God at all.</P>
<P>AND this Doctrine of the Wi&s;dom and Recti|tude of the divine Government is al&s;o the very Foundation of that Doctrine plainly taught in Scripture, and univer&s;ally believed by all Chri&s;ti|ans, <HI>viz.</HI> That at the Day of Judgment the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of all God's Ways will be made manife&s;t to all the World, and the Wi&s;dom of all his Conduct cleared up before the intellectual Sy&s;tem, to God's everla&s;ting Honor, to the Joy of all holy Beings, and to the eternal Confu&s;ion of all God's Enemies. (<HI>Jude</HI> 15.) For then will the Lord come <HI>with ten thou&s;ands of his Saints, to execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them&mdash;of all their HARD SPEE|CHES, which ungodly Sinners have &s;poken again&s;t him.</HI>&mdash;But if God's Ways have not in fact been
<PB N="12" REF="008541_0019_102F68429ECD48D0">
wi&s;e and good, they cannot, at the Day of Judg|ment, when all Things will be bro't to Light, ap|pear to be &s;o.&mdash;If God has done wrong (Heaven forbid the Bla&s;phemy!) all the World will know it then. And if God has deliberately and volun|tarily acted contrary to his better Judgment, in this infinitely important Affair of the Permi&s;&s;ion of Sin, ab&s;olutely for no good End at all, and ab&s;o|lutely without any Motive, it will then appear be|fore the Eyes of Angels, Men &amp; Devils, to God's eternal Reproach, to the eternal Grief of all his Friends, and to the eternal Triumph of all his Enemies, who will be glad to &s;ee the Being, they mo&s;t of all hate, fall under Blame, as well as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IF this were the Ca&s;e, it would be (for aught I can &s;ee) more for God's Honor, that there never &s;hould be a Day of Judgment, and that the Truth of things never &s;hould come to Light. Yea, it had been better if God had never made the World.</P>
<P>AND now does the Author of the <HI>Attempt</HI> in very Deed believe all this horrid Bla&s;phemy; that he &s;hould blame me &s;o much, for being &s;o confident, that all God's Conduct is wi&s;e and good; and his pre&s;ent Plan, of all po&s;&s;ible Plans, the be&s;t! For, why &s;hould he blame me &s;o much for my Belief, unle&s;s he is &s;trong in the Belief of his own Scheme!</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>IF by "Sin not being God's Scheme, but the Device of the Devil," you mean, that God did not voluntarily permit Sin; but that the Devil brought it in, in Spite of all that God could do to hinder him; why do you maintain, that God did not mean to do, in this Affair, what he knew was <HI>mo&s;t for his own Glory?</HI> For according to this, God exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, to &s;ecure his own Glory, and the Good of the Sy&s;tem too; and would have obtained his End, had not his almighty Power been overmatch'd by the Devil.

<P>BUT there is one Argument, on which I lay great Weight. Yea, on which I build my whole Scheme, viz. that as "God does not in Fact, &s;o he is not obliged to do, what is mo&s;t for his declarative Glory."&mdash;An Argument you have none of you an|&s;wered. I have expre&s;&s;ed it in the&s;e Words, viz.</P>
<P><Q>IT is allowed by all, that God is infinite in Power, and that Space is infinite. Now here is evidently Room for endle&s;s Di&s;plays of divine Glories. In no definite Period of Time; in no given Quantity of Space, can there be a full Di&s;covery of God's Glories; becau&s;e they are ab&s;olutely infinite. And therefore may we not with the utmo&s;t Safety affirm, there is not now &s;uch a Di&s;play? We know there is <HI>now</HI> a greater Di&s;play of God's various natural and moral Perfections, than &s;even thou&s;and Years ago: for there are now Multitudes of rational Beings, which then were not; and an Infinity of other Objects; in which are &s;urpri&s;ing Manife&s;tations of Wi&s;dom, Power and Goodne&s;s, &amp;c. Had God been obliged to make as great Di&s;plays, as he could, of his Perfections, he mu&s;t from Eternity have pro|duced into Exi&s;tence all po&s;&s;ible Beings; the Con|trary of which is evident. And may we not be naturally led from this to doubt, whether God has &s;o much Glory from the Things which now exi&s;t, as he might have had? E&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the obvious Defects and Blemi&s;hes there are; and can ea&s;ily imagine how the&s;e might be corrected by infinite Wi&s;dom.</Q> (p. 13.)</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>TRUE, Sir, we have none of us an&s;wered this Argument. Nor did we expect it would be u&s;ed by any in this Country, as I believe it never was before. It has often been u&s;ed by profe&s;&s;ed Athei&s;ts, in other Countries; who, from the pretended Defects of the natural World, have argued that it could not be the Work of an ab&s;olutely perfect Being; and &s;o that we have no Evidence that there is &s;uch a Being. And

Character, than to think, that God might do better than he does. The&s;e are his Words, <Q>I &s;hall take it for granted, that God is, and that he is nece&s;&s;arily an immen&s;e, eternal, all-knowing, all-powerful, a &s;elf-&s;ufficient, and an unchangeable Being. This being allowed, from hence it will follow, that as God is always capable of doing what is mo&s;t <HI>worthy</HI> and <HI>valuable,</HI> in it &s;elf, and which in the Nature of things, is <HI>right, good, be&s;t</HI> and <HI>fitte&s;t</HI> to be done, &s;eeing he knows wherein the Goodne&s;s, Fitne&s;s, and Va|luablene&s;s of every Action lies: So he <HI>always will act thus,</HI> becau&s;e right, good, fit, &amp;c. are &s;o very beautiful, and excellent in them&s;elves; and are &s;o preferable, in the Nature of things, to their Con|traries, that they always will afford a <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>&s;ufficient Motive,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> <HI>Tracts,</HI> p. 252.</P>
<P>BUT to come to a more particular Con&s;ideration of your Argument, the grand Argument on which your whole Scheme is built; yea, the only Argument you u&s;e, to prove, that God <HI>might</HI> permit Sin, altho' he knew it was not for the be&s;t; not mo&s;t for his Glory, or the Good of the Sy&s;tem: and that therefore we can have no Certainty that he <HI>would not,</HI> from the ab|&s;olute Perfection of his Nature.&mdash;And this, in a few Words, is the Sum of it.</P>
<P><HI>GOD in the Work of Creation has not done his be&s;t, but might have done infinitely better.&mdash;If this be &s;o in one In|&s;tance, it may in another.&mdash;Therefore we can have no A&s;|&s;urance, from the ab&s;olute Perfection of the divine Nature, that God means to do what is be&s;t in his Works of Provi|dence; but have Rea&s;on to think he might have done infi|nitely better.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, if it be really &s;o, that God does not <HI>mean</HI> to order the Affairs of the Univer&s;e in the be&s;t Manner, I have had too good an Opinion of God, and have put too much Confidence in him. And I mu&s;t learn for the Time to come to have lower Thoughts of
<PB N="22" REF="008541_0029_102F6861D5DCB5D0">
God, and higher Thoughts of my &s;elf. I mu&s;t begin to think my &s;elf a &s;uitable Judge, to &s;et up and cen&s;ure God's Works and Ways, and point out wherein he might have done better; not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pecting, that God is wi&s;er and better than I am, and more able and willing to order Things for the be&s;t; or that it &s;avours of Arrogance and Pride, for a Worm of the Du&s;t, to &s;ay to the infinitely wi&s;e God,&mdash;<Q>In <HI>This,</HI> O Lord, and in <HI>That,</HI> thou mighte&s;t have done better. Had I been at thy right Hand, chief Di|rector, I could have laid a Plan for a better natural World, and for a better moral Sy&s;tem.</Q>&mdash;Not once imagining, that God may have wi&s;e Rea&s;ons for all his Works and all his Ways, which lie beyond my Reach. But rather confident, that he had no good Rea&s;on; becau&s;e I &s;ee none. Wherefore I may ven|ture &s;afely to cen&s;ure, as unwi&s;e, any Steps of divine Providence, the Wi&s;dom of which I do not &s;ee. And &s;o, the more blind I am to the Wi&s;dom of the divine Ways, the more Faults I may find, and the more fully point out the divine <HI>Errata.</HI>&mdash;And &s;o, God mu&s;t no longer be e&s;teemed as always acting agreable to in|finite Wi&s;dom; becau&s;e I cannot &s;ee it; and, in the Vanity of my Mind, am entered into a Way of thinking and rea&s;oning, that is the Re&s;ult of the greate&s;t Folly, and pregnant with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>A MORE particular An&s;wer to your Argument is, Sir, I humbly conceive, really needle&s;s. For if I can imagine, to my own Fancy, a better natural World, and a better moral Sy&s;tem; yet, as I do not know that my own Imaginations are right I have not the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to call in Que&s;tion he Wi&s;dom of the divine Conduct; unle&s;s I put more Confidence in my Imaginations, than in "&s;upreme Wi&s;dom which can|not err." But you expre&s;ly own, that you "cannot pretend to prove to a Demon&s;tration, that the pre&s;ent Scheme is not the be&s;t." (p. 5.)&mdash;And merely becau&s;e I cannot &s;ee the Rea&s;on and Wi&s;dom of God's Works
<PB N="23" REF="008541_0030_102F68639293E7B8">
and Ways, at once, to doubt, whether God has acted &s;o wi&s;ely as he might have done, ju&s;t as if he might not have good Rea&s;ons in View, which never entered into my Mind, becomes me, neither "as a Man or a Chri&s;tian." We, who do not &s;ee the whole of God's univer&s;al Plan, nay, not the millionth Part of it, are not in a Capacity to pronounce it a bad Plan. It be|comes us rather to put an implicit Faith in the di|vine Wi&s;dom; and to believe it to be good, becau&s;e it is God's.&mdash;I a little wonder, Sir, how you dare &s;o freely cen&s;ure the Works and Ways of God, your Maker and final Judge!</P>

<P>VERY well, Sir, and don't you know that the natural World is wholly the Work of <HI>God?</HI> God, and God alone was the Creator of the Univer&s;e. The Devil had no Hand in the Work of Creation. And yet, here you <HI>oppo&s;e,</HI> "dangerous" as it is. Yea, here you <HI>begin</HI> your <HI>Oppo&s;ition.</HI> Here you di&s;cover &s;uch <HI>Defects</HI> and <HI>Blemi&s;hes,</HI> and can ea&s;ily imagine how things might have been better done; the World might have been created much &s;ooner and larger; and, it &s;eems, you think, infinitely better in the whole; infinitely more to the Glory of God, and containing infinitely more Happine&s;s.&mdash;So that, for aught appears, you have near or quite as low an Opinion of the natural, as of the moral World; and could mend the one, as ea&s;ily as the other.&mdash;Yea, from God's not any more con&s;ulting his own Glory in the Works of Creation, you are led to doubt whether he has con&s;ulted it, &s;o much as he might have done, in the Works of Providence.</P>
<P>BUT this arguing, you &s;ee, is directly and profe&s;&s;ed|ly again&s;t <HI>God's</HI> Works, and that con&s;idered as &s;uch. And yet you &s;ay, <Q>If it could be made appear, that
<PB N="24" REF="008541_0031_102F686517AD6AA8">
the pre&s;ent Scheme is <HI>God's,</HI> it would be indeed ex|tremely dangerous oppo&s;ing it.</Q> But let the Dan|ger be greater or le&s;s, you have ventured to <HI>oppo&s;e,</HI> and cen&s;ure the Works of Creation, which you own to be <HI>God's</HI> Work. Yea, and finding the Works of Crea|tion &s;o little to the Glory of God, to what they might have been; you are induced to doubt, whether God means always to do that which he knows would be mo&s;t for his own Glory. And from this grow bold to think, that God might, con&s;i&s;tent with his Perfecti|ons, permit Sin (a thing he has done not merely once, but per&s;i&s;ted in every Day, Hour and Moment, near &s;ix thou&s;and Years, in almo&s;t an infinite Number of In&s;tances) when he knew, that in the whole, it would have been infinitely more to his Honour and the Good of the Sy&s;tem, if he had hindered it.&mdash;And &s;o, at la&s;t, really give up the moral Character of the Deity.&mdash; For, it is capable of &s;trict Demon&s;tration, that infinite Wi&s;dom cannot err. Find <HI>one Error</HI> therefore in all God's Works, and it will prove to a Demon&s;tration, that he is not infinitely wi&s;e. Much more, if you find an <HI>Error infinitely great,</HI> and <HI>per&s;i&s;ted in for almo&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and Years.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>PRAY, but how does it look, to make a <HI>Propo&s;al</HI> "with the greate&s;t Humility," which is of &s;uch a Na|ture, as that the <HI>Propo&s;er</HI> him&s;elf, at the &s;ame Time, is obliged to own, mu&s;t argue "the greate&s;t Vanity, Arrogance and Impiety!"&mdash;And then by the mere Strength of &s;uch a Propo&s;al, to attempt to overthrow the Wi&s;dom of God's univer&s;al Plan, even to the Ruin of the moral Character of the Holy ONE of I&s;rael!</P>
<P>IF, to all this, you &s;hould reply, <Q>This Way of Rea&s;oning does not convince me. I cannot believe, a Work is done in the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t Manner, and mo&s;t for God's Glory, merely becau&s;e <HI>God has done it.</HI> If it is arrogant and impious to object, yet I

<P>YOU often in&s;i&s;t, "that we &s;hould acquie&s;ce in that Account of things we have in Scripture." But the Scripture no where leads us to think, that God, in the Works of Creation or Providence, ever does "what is not mo&s;t for his own Glory": but every where to the Contrary. Yea, we our&s;elves are re|quired, "whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, to do all to the Glory of God." And can we at the &s;ame Time imagine, that God allows him&s;elf, in the mo&s;t important Affairs, to do "what is not mo&s;t for his own Glory"? Would God have us aim at his Glory more than he him&s;elf does?&mdash;Be&s;ides, the Scriptures inform us, that when God had fini&s;hed the Work of Creation, and &s;urveyed the whole, he pro|nounced it all to be "very good;" notwith&s;tanding all the Objections you have to make again&s;t it. And the pious P&s;almi&s;t cries out, <HI>O Lord, how manifold are thy Works! In Wi&s;dom ha&s;t thou made them all.</HI> P&s;al. civ. 24.</P>

<P>AND how know we, dear Sir, if God thinks be&s;t to have a larger Number of Intelligences to behold his Glory, and be happy in him, but that he judges it be&s;t not to bring them into Exi&s;tence, till the pre&s;ent "Grand Drama" &s;hall be fini&s;hed, at the Day of Judgment? That they may, without &s;haring the Hazard of the pre&s;ent confu&s;ed State of Things, reap the Benefit of the whole, thr&ocirc; eternal Ages; while Angels and Saints may be appointed their In&s;tructors, to lead them into the Knowledge of all God's Ways to his Creatures, and of all their Ways to him, from the Time of Satan's Revolt in Heaven, to the final Con&s;ummation of all Things. And &s;o, as the Jewi&s;h Di&s;pen&s;ation was introductory and preparatory to the Chri&s;tian; &s;o this pre&s;ent Univer&s;e may be intro|ductory and preparatory to one, after the Day of Judgment, almo&s;t infinitely larger.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the divine Conduct, on the pre&s;ent Plan, is perfect in Wi&s;dom, Glory and Beauty; then the pre&s;ent Plan may be a good Introduction to as many future Sy&s;tems, as God plea&s;es: till the whole Sum of Good is rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible Degree.&mdash;Or rather the Knowledge, Humility, Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s of finite Intelligences may continually augment, with the greate&s;t Celerity, thr&ocirc; eternal Ages; while Sy&s;tem after Sy&s;tem comes into Ex|i&s;tence under the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible Advantages for the &s;wifte&s;t Progre&s;s in all divine Improvements.&mdash;But if God has mi&s;s'd it in the beginning of his Works, there is a Foun|dation laid for ill Thoughts of him to be handed down to all &s;ucceeding Sy&s;tems thr&ocirc; eternal Ages, if any &s;uch &s;hould ever be: And the Damage of what is pa&s;t can never be repaired, to Eternity.&mdash;If our Author's Hypo|the&s;is is true, it &s;eems as if it would be a Pity any more Worlds &s;hould ever be created, to come to the Know|ledge of their Maker's Di&s;honour.&mdash;Yea, a Pity the pre|&s;ent Sy&s;tem ever came into Being.</NOTE> That this will

<P>I WILL only add, that the Death of Chri&s;t, and the Work of our Redemption, gives a Di&s;play of the di|vine Perfections, infinitely fuller; and &s;hews <HI>what God is,</HI> in an infinitely clearer and brighter Manner, than the Creation of Sy&s;tems.&mdash;It is a &s;mall thing with the <HI>Almighty</HI> to create Worlds; a Work &s;carce worth our Notice, or worthy ever to be thought of, compared with the Work of Redemption by the Death of his Son.

Much more mu&s;t it be &s;o here: As we have the greate&s;t Certainty, that the &s;upreme Ruler of the Univer&s;e is a Being of infinite Under&s;tanding, and of perfect Rectitude; and as we are at an infinite Re|move from a full Comprehen&s;ion of his grand univer|&s;al Scheme.</P>

<P>AND, <HI>Ab&s;urdities,</HI> let me tell you, that if you did but under&s;tand the Scheme you are oppo&s;ing, you would know, are &s;o far from following from it, that they are ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with it.</P>
<P>FOR the Doctrine of the Wi&s;dom of God in the Permi&s;&s;ion of Sin, &s;uppo&s;es Sin, in it &s;elf and in all its natural Tendencies, to be infinitely evil, infinitely contrary to the Honour of God, and Good of the Sy&s;tem. For herein con&s;i&s;ts the Wi&s;dom of God in the Affair, not in bringing Good out of Good, but in bringing infinite Good out of infinite Evil, and never &s;uffering one Sin to happen in all his Domini|ons, but which, notwith&s;tanding its infinitely evil Nature and Tendency, infinite Wi&s;dom can and will over-rule to greater Good, in the whole. So that all the&s;e Objections are the Re&s;ult of Ignorance or Per|ver&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>FOR Sin, in it&s;elf, and its natural Tendencies, be|ing ju&s;t as evil as th&ograve; God never meant to, and in fact never did, bring any Good out of it; it is as much, to be hated for its evil Nature and Tendency, to be

repented of in our&s;elves, and lamented in others, mourned for, watched and prayed and preached a|gain&s;t; as if no Good was ever to be brought out of it.</P>
<P>JUST as it was in the Affair of Jo&s;eph. It was a vile, an impious and barbarous thing, for his Brethren to do as they did: Hateful in it&s;elf, and in the Eyes of God, and of all good Beings: And to be mourned for, and lamented, and te&s;tified again&s;t, as &s;uch. It was di&s;honorable to God, who&s;e Authority they de|&s;pi&s;ed, and who&s;e De&s;ign to advance Jo&s;eph they in|tended to fru&s;trate: Cruel to their aged pious Father, and barbarous to their Brother.&mdash;And in fact <HI>they were verily Guilty;</HI> as their Con&s;ciences te&s;tified, in the Day of their Di&s;tre&s;s. (<HI>Gen.</HI> xlii. 21.) &mdash;And if after all this, contrary to their Intentions, great Good comes out of this Affair, no Thanks to them for that. They were &s;till <HI>verily Guilty;</HI> and even every Whit as much to blame, as ever; and had as great Rea&s;on for godly Sorrow, and true Repentance; as is plain to the weake&s;t Capacity.&mdash;I appeal to the common Sen&s;e of all Mankind. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Gen. xlv. 5. Jo&s;eph &s;peaking to his Brethren, &s;ays, <HI>Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with your &s;elves, that ye &s;old me hither: For God did &s;end me before you to pre&s;erve Life.</HI>&mdash;Which <HI>POOL</HI> thus ex|plains.&mdash; <Q><HI>Be not grieved,</HI> to wit, immoderately, &amp;c. He doth not di&s;&s;wade them from godly Sorrow.&mdash; <HI>Nor angry with your &s;elves.</HI> In the Hebrew it is, <HI>Neither let there be Anger in your Eyes.</HI> i. e.

God by his wi&s;e, powerful, and gracious Providence over-ruled your evil Intentions to an happy End, &amp;c. which th&ocirc; it doth not le&s;&s;en your Sin, yet ought to qualify your Sorrow.</Q> See <HI>POOL</HI> on the Place.</P>
<P>N. B. JOSEPH'S Brethren had been for &s;ome Time in ex|ternal Circum&s;tances very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; their Minds full of Heavine&s;s and Grief from that Quarter; and they ready &s;ometimes in their Angui&s;h to be angry at, and upbraid one another, for what was pa&s;t. Which kind of Grief was not of the Nature of godly Sorrow. And this was what Jo&s;eph referred to. He would not have them grieve and afflict them&s;elves, &amp;c. in that Sort; for that all was brought to a happy I&s;&s;ue. He did not mean to di&s;&s;wade them from godly Sorrow. He knew, the more they &s;aw of the Wi&s;dom, Holine&s;s and Good|ne&s;s of God in this Affair, the more would they love him, and loath them&s;elves; and mourn after a godly Sort, that they had endeavoured to counteract him. The more Beauty they &s;aw in God's Scheme, the more would they hate their own, which was de&s;igned to fru&s;trate his.</P>
<P>GOD'S Scheme was to advance Jo&s;eph, &amp;c. Their proud Hearts could not endure it. They viewed him as hav|ing a native Tincture of Vanity. They envied him, and wanted to keep him down; and laid a Scheme for it; which God over-ruled, directly contrary to their very Hearts.&mdash;Now for them to look upon God's Scheme as glorious, mu&s;t imply in its very Nature, that they looked upon their own Scheme with the utmo&s;t Abhorrence. Which mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e deep Humiliation, and &s;incere Re|pentence. They could not really and heartily like God's Scheme, without a &s;incere Abhorrence of their own. Nor can any one Being in the Sy&s;tem heartily like God's Scheme in permitting Sin in general, without a &s;incere Abhorrence of Sin in general: and a hearty De&s;ire that all &s;inful Schemes may be fru&s;trated, ju&s;t as this was, which Jo&s;eph's Brethren had laid; for this is God's De&s;ign.&mdash;Had Jo&s;eph's Brethren, before they were &s;ound|ly humbled, been let into God's Scheme, to &s;ee what he had done to advance their Brother, their Envy would have revived; and they felt an Inclination to lay &s;ome new Scheme to take him down. They mu&s;t be &s;oundly humbled, before they would heartily approve God's Scheme, and be willing to bow to Jo&s;eph. But let their proud Hearts be humbled, and they love their Brother as they ought; and they would be glad to &s;ee him ex|alted, and a&s;hamed to think of what they had done, and chearfully pay him the Honour which was his due.&mdash; So a perfectly humble and holy Temper would lead us perfectly to acquie&s;ce in God's univer&s;al Plan, which is de&s;igned to exalt God, and make all his happy Subjects feel their comparative Nothingne&s;s, to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible Degree&mdash;That <HI>God may be all in all.</HI>&mdash;See this illu&s;trated at large in my <HI>Sermons.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

Or for the Jews to crucify the Lord of Glory? Becau&s;e God, in both Ca&s;es, contrary to their De&s;ign, brought great Good out of the&s;e great Evils.&mdash;I appeal to your own Con&s;cience.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, but if you appeal to me, I mu&s;t frankly tell you, that if greater Good is brought out of Evil, we are not to be &s;orry, but rather to rejoyce that we have &s;inned. This Principle I take for granted, as &s;elf-evident. And on this Hypothe&s;is I build my Rea|&s;oning. (p. 17, 18.)</P>

<P>THEN it &s;eems, you think, that Jo&s;eph's Bre|thren had no Cau&s;e to repent of their Sin, in attempt|ing to fru&s;trate God's De&s;ign to advance their Bro|ther; becau&s;e in Spite of all their Malice and Envy, God over-ruled all they did to bring about his de|&s;igned Advancement, to the be&s;t Advantage. Their Sin, you &s;ay, <Q>God in infinite Wi&s;dom over-ruled for the Advancement of Jo&s;eph; the Pre&s;ervation
<PB N="34" REF="008541_0041_102F6884AD4A3D00">
of Jacob and his Family; and a Train of the mo&s;t happy Events to the Church of God, from that Day to this.</Q> (p. 6.) To which you add, <Q>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, much of the divine Power, Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, &amp;c. was di&s;played in bringing &s;o much Good from &s;uch Treachery.</Q> Therefore Jo&s;eph's Brethren ought, in Stead of Sorrow, rather to "keep an everla&s;ting Jubilee" in Remembrance of their Malice, Envy, Cruelty and Impiety exerci&s;ed in that Deed. This is one of the "pernicious Con&s;equences" not of mine, but of your own Scheme. Nor can it be got rid of, as to tho&s;e In&s;tances of Sin, which you acknow|ledge God has over-ruled to greater Good. And as you own "you cannot prove to a Demon&s;tration" but that greater Good will finally be brought out of all Sin, in general; &s;o upon your Scheme you can|not be certain, that you or any other Sinner has Rea|&s;on to repent of Sin. You do not know as yet, whe|ther to be &s;orry, or glad. Yea, according to you, "it is above your, or perhaps any human Talents" to decide this Que&s;tion. (p. 5, 6.) Therefore upon your Scheme, all Sinners mu&s;t put off their Repen|tance, until by &s;ome new Revelation from Heaven it is declared, that God never will over-rule all to greater Good. And as &s;oon as ever we are a&s;&s;ured, that God does not intend to over-rule all Things to his Glory and to the Good of the Sy&s;tem; then, and not till then, mu&s;t we begin to be &s;orry that we have &s;inned: &mdash;that is, to be &s;orry that we have not &s;ought the Glory of God and Good of the Sy&s;tem, with all our Might. &mdash; But why &s;hould we be &s;orry now? For, if God does not &s;eek his own Glory, why &s;hould we? if He does not aim at the general Good, why &s;hould we? ought we to be more holy than God him&s;elf? No: the utmo&s;t Extent of our Duty is only <HI>to be perfect, as our Father which is in Heaven, is perfect.</HI>&mdash; So that finally, your Scheme, in whatever Light con&s;idered, will ex|clude true Repentance out of the World.&mdash;However,
<PB N="35" REF="008541_0042_102F68866A86A090">
there is this Comfort by the way, that your Scheme is &s;o plainly incon&s;i&s;tent with common Sen&s;e, that it can never be believed by a rational Creature.

However, he did execute it.&mdash; Ver. 5. <HI>And it was told the King of Egypt, that the People fled: and the Heart of Pharaoh and of his Servants was turned again&s;t the People, and they &s;aid, Why have we done this, that we have let I&s;rael go from &s;erving us?

true: and I believe both the Con&s;equences, which equally follow.&mdash; You believe the Propo&s;ition to be true, when you think it will &s;erve your turn: but at another time &s;ay, "I do doubt whether God in fact does what is mo&s;t for his own Glory."</P>
<P>AS God intended before the Foundation of the World to permit Sin, for holy and wi&s;e Ends, it was of the utmo&s;t Importance, that he &s;hould do it under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, that the whole intellectual Sy&s;tem might &s;ee and know, that he did not do it, as looking upon Sin, as being Good in it &s;elf, or as tending to Good: yea, under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, that his Permi&s;&s;ion of it might not, in the Eyes of finite Intel|ligences, le&s;&s;en, but rather infinitely increa&s;e the Hor|rors of it. Therefore he not only created all holy, at fir&s;t; but al&s;o "forbid Sin under the &s;evere&s;t Penal|ties;" yea actually executed the infinitely dreadful Penalty on the &s;inning Angels, who were the fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, without any Mercy. And while he exerci&s;ed Mercy towards fallen Man, he did it in &s;uch a Way, as will finally, and on the whole, &s;hew his Hatred of Sin, as much, nay more than it he had treated them as he did the fallen Angels. But while the whole Tenour of his Conduct thus joins to &s;et his Hatred of Sin in a mo&s;t &s;triking Light; his actual Permi&s;&s;ion of it, at the &s;ame time, equally proves, that he did not think it be&s;t, to prevent it by his own immediate Interpo&s;ition. Which demon&s;trates, that he &s;aw a better Way than that, to advance his own Glory and the Good of the Sy&s;tem. In what Re&s;pects his pre&s;ent Method is better than that, I have endeavour'd to &s;hew in my <HI>Sermons.</HI> (p. 125,&mdash;209.)

<P>THAT Sin, in it &s;elf, is infinitely di&s;agreeable to the divine Nature, is granted. That it was never|thele&s;s be&s;t, that Sin &s;hould be, with a View to the Good to be brought out of it by God; and that
<PB N="46" REF="008541_0053_102F68A9415143D8">
therefore God acted agreeable to all his Perfections in the Permi&s;&s;ion of it, is &s;till affirmed. Nor do the&s;e Words, con&s;idered with their Context, militate a|gain&s;t, but rather greatly confirm this Truth.</P>
<P>FOR the true Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Words is plainly this, <HI>viz.</HI> that the &s;inful State of Mankind before the Flood was in it &s;elf infinitely di&s;agreeable to God, who is an infinitely holy and benevolent Being; and viewed therefore merely in it &s;elf, had the greate&s;t Tendency, in Fact, to <HI>grieve</HI> and di&s;tre&s;s the HOLY ONE; and make him &s;incerely <HI>repent</HI> that ever he made the World. And therefore, were Things always to be &s;o, and no Good ever to come of it, he never would have made the World; nor would he have conti|nued it in Being when made, to grieve his Heart, and wear out his Life with continual Sorrow; infi|nitely vexed and grieved, cro&s;&s;ed and di&s;appointed, in a continued Series of Wickedne&s;s, from the begin|ning to the end of the World. Therefore as the&s;e Words, in the &s;tronge&s;t Manner, expre&s;s the infinite Holine&s;s and Goodne&s;s of the divine Nature; &s;o they are quite favourable to the pre&s;ent Truth.&mdash;For,</P>
<P>IF God does really look upon Sin in this Light, why did he ever make the World, as he knew how Things would i&s;&s;ue? Or, why did not he de&s;troy all Mankind at the general Deluge, as he knew what they were, and how they would prove afterwards? (<HI>their Imaginations evil from their Youth. Gen.</HI> viii. 21.) and make a new World, and People it with a better Race? Which he might have done with infinite Ea&s;e. &mdash;The plain and only An&s;wer, which we can po&s;&s;ibly give to the&s;e Que&s;tions, is, that altho' Sin was &s;o in|finitely di&s;agreeable to the Divine Nature, con&s;idered in it &s;elf; yet, on the whole, he cho&s;e the pre&s;ent Plan, with a View to the infinitely greater Good, he knew he could, &amp; he knew he would, bring out of all this Evil.

<P>AS to the Affair of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> which you &s;o much in&s;i&s;t upon, I grant, it was by infinite Wi&s;dom over|ruled for Good. But however, it is not at all "to your Purpo&s;e." (p. 6.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT, Sir, perhaps others will think it much to the Purpo&s;e. For, if God has, in only one In&s;tance, permitted Sin for wi&s;e and holy Ends, it is at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible, that he may have done &s;o in all In&s;tances. And if <HI>he always acts like him&s;elf,</HI> no doubt, this is, in fact, the very Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if God did permit Sin in the Affair of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> for wi&s;e and good Ends, all your <HI>ten Objections</HI> in P. 16, 17, 18, 19. are an&s;wered all at once; and indeed the Sub&s;tance of your Book.&mdash; Unle&s;s you will adopt the very Ab&s;urdities you pretend to abhor, and maintain for Truth, <Q>that God was the Author of that Sin, and loved it; and that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Bre|thren acted like the greate&s;t Saints in that Affair; had no Cau&s;e to mourn for their Sin, nor their Father to lament his want of Succe&s;s in the Edu|cation of his Children, or to be at all grieved for their Wickedne&s;s. Yea, that their Sin was no Sin, but rather a Virtue. And if <HI>Jacob</HI> or <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> approved and admired the Wi&s;dom of God in that Affair, it mu&s;t argue, they had very unworthy Conceptions of God, to think he could not bring about his good De&s;igns without &s;uffering &s;o much Evil; and had they been con&s;i&s;tent with them|&s;elves, they mu&s;t have turned Infidels; or at lea&s;t have di&s;carded all tho&s;e Texts of Scripture, which repre&s;ent God as <HI>hating Sin,</HI> being <HI>grieved</HI> with it,
<PB N="52" REF="008541_0059_102F68B7E0DA2FD0">
and <HI>angry</HI> becau&s;e of it.</Q>&mdash; If in fact God did per|mit <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> to be &s;old, <HI>meaning it unto Good;</HI> if this was <HI>God's Scheme,</HI> in &s;uch a Sen&s;e as that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> might ju&s;tly &s;ay, <HI>GOD &s;ent me hither;</HI> then may you do well to recon&s;ider your own Words, with Application to your &s;elf; <Q>If the pre&s;ent Scheme be <HI>GOD's,</HI> it would be extremely dangerous oppo&s;ing it; and argue the highe&s;t Vanity, Arrogance and Impiety.</Q> It is plain Fact, that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> viewed and con&s;idered that whole Affair as <HI>GOD's Scheme,</HI> as much as I do, and u&s;es as &s;trong Expre&s;&s;ions, as I have any where done.

<P>BUT <Q>it is not parallel in one material Cir|cum&s;tance. Nay, the Ca&s;e is wholly different, and therefore quite foreign to the Purpo&s;e: For all concerned in the Conduct and Con&s;equences of that Affair, were in a State of <HI>Sin;</HI> and therefore de&s;erved all the Cha&s;ti&s;ements they received. They had all Blemi&s;hes in their Characters, which may ea&s;ily account for their Sufferings.</Q> (p. 6, 7.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>TRUE. "They <HI>de&s;erved</HI> their Sufferings." Nor did God ever inflict Pain, no, not the lea&s;t De|gree of it, in any one In&s;tance, in the whole intel|lectual Sy&s;tem, but in which it was de&s;erved, as much as they de&s;erved their Sufferings.&mdash;To be &s;ure, we in this World "are in a <HI>State of Sin,</HI>" and de&s;erve our Sufferings, and need our Cha&s;ti&s;ements, as much as they did. Nor did God begin to cha&s;ti&s;e us, until after we had become Sinners.</P>
<P>IF you &s;hould &s;ay, "that <HI>Jo&s;eph's</HI> Brethren de&s;erved to be cha&s;ti&s;ed for their Pride and Envy; and that therefore God left them to them&s;elves, to fall into that Sin, that he might in the I&s;&s;ue humble them, and bring them to a better Mind:" this would over|throw your whole Scheme. For according to this, God did permit Sin for wi&s;e and holy Ends; the very Point, that I affirm, and the very Point, that you deny.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="008541_0060_102F68B963B23AB8">OR, if you &s;hould &s;ay, "However, as they were <HI>Sinners,</HI> God might <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> leave them to Sin; but God could not, con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> leave <HI>inno|cent</HI> Beings to Sin;" this would &s;uppo&s;e, that God was <HI>obliged,</HI> in Ju&s;tice, to keep all innocent Beings from falling. And con&s;equently, that God's per|mitting Sin was an Act of <HI>Inju&s;tice;</HI> and con&s;equent|ly, that God is not a ju&s;t Being.</P>
<P>OR, if you &s;hould only &s;ay, that "they had <HI>provoked</HI> God to leave them; but innocent Beings had not;" it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that according to Scripture-account, God permitted <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> to be &s;old, not &s;o much in anger at <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> or <HI>Jacob's</HI> Family; as out of love to them, for their Good. As it is written, <HI>God meant it unto Good.</HI> God had his own Glory and the general Good in View, in that Affair, ju&s;t as I &s;uppo&s;e he had in &s;uffering our fir&s;t Parents to fall.</P>
<P>OR, if I &s;hould grant, "God &s;uffered <HI>Jo&s;eph's</HI> Brethren to fall into that Sin, out of <HI>Anger</HI> at them, as was doubtle&s;s the Ca&s;e with <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> when God &s;uffered him to pur&s;ue I&s;rael into the red Sea:" yet it is plain, that in both Ca&s;es, he had his own Glory and the general Good in view. And &s;o both Ca&s;es are analogous to his Conduct relative to the whole Sy&s;tem, for Sub&s;tance. And only granting, what none deny, that it was no <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> to innocent Beings, for God to permit them to fall; there is no "ma|terial Difference," which at all hurts the "parallel," for the "Purpo&s;e," for which it is u&s;ed in my Ser|mons. For this is my Argument, as I ju&s;t now &s;tated it: "If in &s;ome In&s;tance; God permits Sin for wi&s;e and holy Ends, it is po&s;&s;ible he may in all. And if he <HI>always acts like him&s;elf,</HI> then, no doubt, in fact, he always <HI>does.</HI>" (See my <HI>Serm.</HI> p. 103, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) An Argument you have no way to an&s;wer, but by giv|ing

<P>FINITE Intelligences, holy as they originally were, needed to have their holy Bia&s;&s;es farther con|firmed; as is plain from the Apo&s;tacy of &s;ome of them.

For, as St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> &s;aith, <Q>Unle&s;s it were good that there &s;hould be Evil, it would by no Means be permitted by the Almighty God, who is able to hinder the Commi&s;&s;ion of that Evil, if he would.</Q> (<HI>Enchi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">id.

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO, Sir; but rather, if infinite Wi&s;dom has cho&s;en the be&s;t, it is the highe&s;t Arrogance in us, to &s;ay, there might have been a better.

<P>YES, Sir, a &s;hocking Scheme indeed! but it is one of your own Invention. It is none of mine.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE that "Love is the Sum of God's moral Perfections;" and in one Sen&s;e (an <HI>ill</HI> Sen&s;e) there is no &s;uch thing as <HI>Vengeance</HI> in the Divine Nature.

(p. 191.) &mdash; And I believe, that the chief Advantages, which will accrue to holy Beings from a View of the Mi&s;ery of the Damned, will be, as the Scriptures teach, (<HI>Rom.</HI> ix. 22.) to give them the mo&s;t lively and affecting Sen&s;e of the glorious Per|fections of the Divine Nature; <HI>viz.</HI> boundle&s;s Power, Holine&s;s, and Goodne&s;s; or in other Words, God's infinite Hatred of Sin, and Ability to puni&s;h it, and the infinite Riches of his Grace in the Work of Re|demption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. (p. 191.) For it is a View, not of Deformity, but of Beauty; not of Mi&s;ery, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> but of the glorious Perfections of the Divine Nature, manife&s;ted in the moral Government of the World, &mdash; an ab&s;olutely perfect Plan, which is the Source of the Happine&s;s of the heavenly State.&mdash; And I believe, that it is <HI>Love,</HI> to God, to Virtue, and to the be&s;t Good of the Sy&s;tem, which is the chief

There can be no other Rea&s;on. For, if I loved God and the Sy&s;tem, I &s;hould be glad to have God glorified, and the Sy&s;tem in&s;tructed by my Example; if I mu&s;t be puni&s;hed for my Crimes. As &s;ometimes a penitent Malefactor on the Gallows, from Benevolence to his fellow-Creatures, may &s;incerely wi&s;h the Spectators might take Warning by him. &mdash; But to the impenitent Sinner, who is an Enemy to God, and to the Sy&s;tem, and to all Good; and who &s;ees not the great Evil of Sin, nor his De&s;ert of Damnation; and cares only for him&s;elf; Things mu&s;t appear in a very different Light.&mdash; Had Pharaoh, for In&s;tance, (whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> views as a Specimen of ob&s;tinate Sinners in general, Rom. ix.) at the Bottom of the Red Sea, heard the Hebrews &s;ing, "The Lord hath Triumphed gloriou&s;ly;" and upon it remembred the Word once &s;ent to him, "For this Cau&s;e have I rai&s;ed thee up, for to &s;hew in thee my Power, and that my Name may be declared throughout all the Earth:" it would have been a Comfort to him "infinitely wor&s;e than nothing."&mdash;If he mu&s;t be drowned, he had infinitely rather it &s;hould an&s;wer no &s;uch End.

<P>YEA, my Friend, what if it &s;hould be thought, that your Scheme is little, if any, better than down-right Athei&s;m? To be &s;ure, if your Scheme is true, all Religion is overthrown. For if God has &s;uffered in|finite Evil and Mi&s;chief to come into his own World, a World ab&s;olutely under his Government, in which <HI>he doth according to his Plea&s;ure,</HI> ab&s;olutely without any good End; yea, contrary to his better Judgment; and when he could ea&s;ily have hindered it; he is infinitely far from being an ab&s;olutely perfect Being, as has been proved.

And &s;o God's Scheme was di&s;concerted, and he di&s;appointed, and his World in a great Mea&s;ure ruined, in Spite of the utmo&s;t Exertion of his infinite Wi&s;dom and almighty Power!" &mdash; Some of your Readers, perhaps, may think this your Meaning.

<P>HOWEVER, I hope, by this time, you are tho|roughly convinced, that whether we can find out the Rea&s;ons of the Divine Conduct in this Affair, or no; yet it is of the utmo&s;t Importance, that we firmly believe, that God has acted wi&s;ely, and in a Manner agreable to all his glorious Perfections. For it is an Affair of &s;o great Moment, and &s;o infinitely intere&s;t|ing; that if we habitually believe, that God acted contrary to his better Judgment in it, we mu&s;t en|tirely give up the ab&s;olute Perfection of his Nature. And if God is not an ab&s;olutely perfect Being, he is not God. We may compliment him with the <HI>Name;</HI> but we take away the <HI>Thing.</HI>&mdash;"We Chri&s;tians" (&s;aith <HI>Origen</HI>) <Q>&s;ay, that God can do nothing which is in it &s;elf evil, no more than he is able not to be God. For if God do any evil, he is not God. God willeth nothing unbecoming him&s;elf&mdash;This is incon&s;i&s;tent with his God&s;hip.</Q> (See Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI>'s <HI>intel. Sy&s;t.</HI> p. 874.) &mdash;Agreable to holy Scripture, 2 Tim. ii. 13. <HI>He cannot deny him&s;elf.</HI> Heb. vi. 18. <HI>It is impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie.</HI>&mdash;And if we give up the ab&s;olute Perfection of the Divine Nature; and &s;o ungod the Deity; it will become impo&s;&s;ible, were our Hearts ever &s;o holy, to love, wor&s;hip, and tru&s;t in him as God, as an ab|&s;olutely perfect Being; or rejoyce in his univer&s;al Government, and be &s;incerely glad that he is at the Head of the Creation, and can and will do <HI>according to his Plea&s;ure in the Armies of Heaven, and among&s;t the Inhabitants of the Earth.</HI> &mdash;Yea, it would be a thing

infinitely de&s;irable, that &s;ome better Being, &s;ome ab|&s;olutely perfect Being, might be in his Place and take his Throne.&mdash; And &s;o your Scheme really ju&s;ti|fies a Spirit of Di&s;content and Rebellion throughout all God's Dominions.&mdash;But this ill Idea of the Di|vine Maje&s;ty, which is harboured in many a Heart in this apo&s;tate World, is of the Nature of Bla&s;phemy, <HI>the abominable Thing which God's Soul hates,</HI> and ought to be entirely rooted out of our Minds.</P>

<P>A great Part of the Wickedne&s;s of this God|hating World con&s;i&s;ts <HI>in hard Thoughts and hard Speeches again&s;t God. (Jude</HI> 15.) Therefore "Sin cannot be got out of the World," till Men are brought to think well of God, and of all his Ways. At lea&s;t, &s;o far as to put an implicit Tru&s;t and Confidence in him, as an ab&s;olutely perfect Being, fit to be at the Head of the Univer&s;e, and to have the Management and Order|ing of all the Affairs of the whole Sy&s;tem in his Hands.</P>
<P>IT is in vain, to pretend to make Men holy, with|out Love to God. For it is the fir&s;t and greate&s;t Part of Holine&s;s, to love God; and the chief Foun|dation of all Religion. (<HI>Mat.</HI> xxii. 37.) And it is im|po&s;&s;ible Men &s;hould love God, while they believe, habitually believe, that there is <HI>no God:</HI> i. e. no Being of ab&s;olute Perfection at the Head of the Univer&s;e, ordering all Things in the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t Manner.

<P>SIR, I did think my <HI>Attempt</HI> an unan&s;werable Piece: And that I had a good Right in the mo&s;t public Manner to call upon you to "retract." (p. 30.) &mdash; But, <Q>upon the whole, I think my &s;elf under the &s;tronge&s;t Engagements to make the mo&s;t grateful
<PB N="72" REF="008541_0079_102F68F36A2B78A0">
Acknowlegements for &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a Favour as your Reply to my Remarks.</Q> (p. 30.) &mdash; Indeed, the Permi&s;&s;ion of Sin has always appeared to me as an un|accountable Affair. (p. 15.) I could never &s;ee how God could do it, con&s;i&s;tent with his own Glory or the Good of the Sy&s;tem (p. 12, 13. 19&mdash;24.) or con&s;i&s;t|ent even with his own perfect Happine&s;s: as a Being of infinite Benevolence, I thought, mu&s;t have had "greater Plea&s;ure," if Sin and Mi&s;ery had been for ever unknown in his World. (p. 22.) Therefore, I thought, that "Sin was not God's Scheme, but a Device of the Devil." (p. 13, 14, 15, 16.) And be|cau&s;e it is plain Fact, that God has not hindered the Devil from doing all this Mi&s;chief, as he might ea&s;ily have done, I have been led "to doubt whether God does in Fact, and &s;o whether he is obliged," from the ab&s;olute Perfection of his Nature, "to do, what is mo&s;t for his Glory." (p. 13.) &mdash; You &s;ee my whole Scheme, and you have replied to the whole and every Part of it; but if after all, I &s;hould feel not &s;atisfied, what &s;hall I do?</P>

<P>I WILL tell you, Sir, what to do. And may the Lord give you an <HI>hearing Ear,</HI> and an <HI>under|&s;tanding Heart.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. BE firmly per&s;waded, that not the Devil, but God, and God alone, is the ab&s;olute Governour of the World.</P>
<P>REASON teaches, that God never will, and never can, voluntarily give up the Government of his own World, into the Hands of his greate&s;t and mo&s;t a|vowed Enemy, the Devil. And, if the Devil is one of God's Creatures, as God him&s;elf has taught us in his Word, he is &s;o inferiour to the God that made him, as to be in his Hands as the Clay is in the Hands of the Potter, ab&s;olutely at his Controul; un|able by Power or Policy to bring any thing to pa&s;s, but by the Permi&s;&s;ion of the great God; who from
<PB N="73" REF="008541_0080_102F68F4EEFB34D8">
Heaven hath declared, &s;aying, <HI>My Coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and I will do all my Plea&s;ure,</HI> (I&s;ai. xlvi. 10.) And who&s;e Schemes cannot po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;concerted, by the united Powers of Earth and Hell. &mdash; Nay, the Powers of Darkne&s;s are &s;o entirely at the Controul of the Al|mighty, that Satan could not touch holy <HI>Job,</HI> or any Part of his Sub&s;tance, nor &s;o much as put a Lie in the Mouth of <HI>Ahab</HI>'s lying Prophets, without the Di|vine Permi&s;&s;ion. Nor could the affrighted Devils &s;o much as enter into the Herd of Swine, till our Saviour &s;aid, <HI>Go.</HI> (1 Kin. xxii. 22. Job i. 12. &amp; xi. 6. Mat. viii. 31, 32.) How then could the Devil &s;educe our fir&s;t Parents, and break up God's original Plan, and ruin his new-made World; in &s;pite of the utmo&s;t Exertion of infinite Wi&s;dom and almighty Power!</P>
<P>THE whole Tenour of Divine Revelation leads us to believe, that the Providence of God extends to all Things which come to pa&s;s. If the Devil or wicked Men were not under the Divine Controul, we &s;hould have Rea&s;on to <HI>fear</HI> them: but our Savi|our a&s;&s;ures us, they cannot hurt an Hair of our Heads, without God's Permi&s;&s;ion; who&s;e Providence extends even to the very <HI>Sparrows,</HI> a Bird &s;o in&s;ignificant, that <HI>two of them were &s;old for a Farthing:</HI> and much more to the Concerns of Men, who are <HI>of more Value than many Sparrows:</HI> and he enjoins his Di&s;ciples, in the belief of this, not to <HI>fear</HI> the mo&s;t cruel Per&s;ecutors; but to <HI>fear</HI> God only: for, &s;ays he, <HI>The very Hairs of your Heads are all numbered. Mat.</HI> x. 16&mdash;31. &mdash; And indeed wicked Men (&s;o ab&s;olute and univer&s;al is the Divine Government) are, according to the Lan|guage of Scripture, which is the Language of God's Heart, in God's Hand, as a <HI>Rod,</HI> an <HI>Ax,</HI> or a <HI>Saw,</HI> and as much at his Controul. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> x. 5&mdash;15. And therefore St. <HI>Paul,</HI> viewing Things in this Light, taught Chri&s;tians in his Day, to con&s;ider all their Per&s;ecu|tions, as coming from the Hand of their heavenly
<PB N="74" REF="008541_0081_102F68F7C79B6EF8">
Father, and de&s;igned by him as kind loving Cha&s;ti&s;e|ments, for their Benefit: and on this Hypothe&s;is, en|courages them not to faint, nor be di&s;couraged: but rather to take all well, and improve all to their &s;pi|ritual Good. (<HI>Heb.</HI> x. xi. xii.) And in this Light all the People of God, from the very earlie&s;t Ages, have been wont to view the Injuries they received from wicked Men, as coming from the Hand of God. So <HI>Job,</HI> when the <HI>Sabeans</HI> and <HI>Chaldeans</HI> had robbed him, views them only as In&s;truments u&s;ed by God to an&s;|wer holy and wi&s;e Ends. <HI>The Lord hath given; and the Lord hath taken away: ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the Lord.</HI> (Job i. 21.) So when <HI>Eglon</HI> King of <HI>Moab</HI> came again&s;t I&s;rael in the time of the Judges, it was looked upon that <HI>God had &s;trengthened him</HI> to do it, thereby to cha&s;ti&s;e them for their Crimes. (<HI>Judg.</HI> iii 10.) So when <HI>Shimei</HI> in a mo&s;t malicious manner <HI>cur&s;ed David,</HI> he &s;aw the Hand of God in it, and &s;aid, <HI>The Lord hath bidden him.</HI> (2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xvi. 11.) So when <HI>Hadad the Edomite,</HI> and <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">n the Son of Eliadah,</HI> endeavoured to di&s;turb <HI>Solomon</HI>'s peaceful Reign, it was believed by good People, that God <HI>&s;tirred them up</HI> to do it, to cha&s;ti&s;e <HI>Solomon</HI> for his Sins. As was al&s;o the Ca&s;e with <HI>Jeroboam the Son of Nebat,</HI> that wicked <HI>"Preten|der,"</HI> who afterwards <HI>made I&s;rael to &s;in.</HI> (1 King. xi.) And when <HI>Rehoboam</HI> the Son of <HI>Solomon,</HI> thro' the Pride of his Heart, and the ill Advice of his young Men, returned a rough An&s;wer to his Subjects, which i&s;&s;ued in the lo&s;s of ten Tribes, and was followed with a long Series of Calamities for many Generations, it was &s;aid, that <HI>the Cau&s;e was of God, that he might per|form his Word,</HI> &amp;c. (2 <HI>Chron.</HI> x. 15.) And when <HI>A|maziah</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI> through the Vanity of his Mind, challenged <HI>Joa&s;h</HI> the King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to Battle, which i&s;&s;ued in his own Overthrow, it was viewed as coming from God. <HI>For it came of God, that he might deliver them into the Hands of their Enemies, becau&s;e they &s;ought after the Gods of Edom</HI> (2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxv. 20.) And
<PB N="75" REF="008541_0082_102F68FD31825100">
when <HI>Ahab</HI> was &s;educed by his fal&s;e Prophets to go up to <HI>Ramoth-Gilead</HI> to Battle, to the lo&s;s of his Life, the whole Plan is repre&s;ented as being laid in Heaven. (1 <HI>King.</HI> xxii.) And when that proud Tyrant, the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> the <HI>Hammer of the whole Earth,</HI> had de&s;troyed Jeru&s;alem, burnt down the holy Temple, and laid all their Country in Ruins, pious People all &s;aw the Hand of God in it, and believed, that <HI>at the Commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah,</HI> 2 King. xxiv. 3.&mdash;But time would fail, to mention all the In|&s;tances of this Nature recorded in God's holy Word. And &s;urely it mu&s;t be needle&s;s, when, as in our pre|&s;ent War, we, thro' all <HI>New-England,</HI> have in &s;o pub|lick a Manner joined univer&s;ally to profe&s;s and act upon this very Principle; that wicked Men are in the Hands of God, and can do nothing but by his Permi&s;&s;ion, and are ab&s;olutely at his Controul. For which Rea&s;on we have had public Fa&s;ts, and public Thank&s;givings, relative to the War, as th&ocirc; we firmly believed the univer&s;al Extent of Divine Providence.</P>
<P>BUT if the Providence of God extends to the <HI>le&s;&s;er,</HI> it much more does to the <HI>greater</HI> Concerns of the in|tellectual Sy&s;tem, as our Saviour rea&s;ons, <HI>Mat.</HI> x. 29, 30, 31. If it extends to the &s;inful Actions of Men in this fallen World, which are comparatively but of little Con&s;equence; much more to the original Intro|duction of Sin into the moral Sy&s;tem; which was an Affair, &s;trictly &s;peaking, of infinite Con&s;equence. &mdash; If it extends to the Sparrows (one of which was va|lued at but half a Farthing) &s;o that they could not any of them <HI>fall on the Ground</HI> without God's all-&s;eeing Eye and all-ordering Hand; much more to the <HI>fall of Angels,</HI> and to the <HI>fall of Man,</HI> Beings of <HI>more Value than many Sparrows.</HI>&mdash;If the <HI>very Hairs of our Heads are all numbered;</HI> much more is God con|cerned about the &s;piritual and eternal Welfare of the whole intellectual Sy&s;tem.&mdash; So that we may have the
<PB N="76" REF="008541_0083_102F68FEB9780170">
greate&s;t A&s;&s;urance, that ever &s;ince the Creation, not one evil Thing has come to pa&s;s, but under the Eye of the OMNISCIENT; determined, permitted, and over-ruled by infinite Wi&s;dom and perfect Rectitude.&mdash; Do you believe this, my Friend? Indeed you mu&s;t believe it with all your Heart,&mdash;for this is "the Scrip|ture-Account of the Matter." Be&s;ides,</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD is a Being of ab&s;olute Perfection; infinite in Wi&s;dom, perfect in Rectitude, boundle&s;s in Good|ne&s;s; who has an infinite Regard to his own Honour and to the Good of the Sy&s;tem: as Rea&s;on and Reve|lation join to teach. And as, from the ab&s;olute Per|fection of the Divine Nature, it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible for God to Lie;</HI> &s;o, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould counteract any of his Perfections. Therefore the whole of his Conduct towards the intellectual Sy&s;tem is ab&s;olutely perfect. And is no more capable of E|mendation, than God is of becoming holier and wi&s;er than he is. For he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily chu&s;e the be&s;t Plan from Eternity, and nece&s;&s;arily abide by it to Eternity.&mdash;For,</P>
<P N="3">3. The holy Scriptures give us the fulle&s;t A&s;&s;urance, that God <HI>is the &s;ame Ye&s;terday, to Day, and for ever, (Heb.</HI> xiii. 8.) <HI>of one Mind, (Job</HI> xxiii. 13.) <HI>With whom there is no Variablene&s;s, neither Shadow of Change, (Jam.</HI> 1.17.) and that his <HI>Coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and he will do all his Plea&s;ure. (I&s;ai.</HI> xlvi. 10.) So that he never did, and never can, alter his original Plan; or &s;uffer him&s;elf to be di&s;appointed. (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> xxxiii. 10, 11.)</P>
<P>HE laid a Scheme to bring the I&s;raelites to the Land of Canaan, and promi&s;ed to do the thing: nor could all their Wickedne&s;s in the Wilderne&s;s provoke him to give up the De&s;ign. Yea, he was di&s;po&s;ed to pro|&s;ecute it, ju&s;t as much as if they had not &s;inned: as he informed <HI>Balaam,</HI> to the terror of <HI>Balak. God is not a Man, that he &s;hould Lie, neither the Son of Man that he &s;hould Repent: &mdash; he hath not behold Iniquity in Jacob,

neither hath he &s;een Perver&s;ene&s;s in I&s;rael. (Num.</HI> xxiii. 16&mdash;21.)&mdash;He had laid a Scheme to continue the Jews his vi&s;ible People, until the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, and the &s;etting up of the Chri&s;tian Church: nor could all their Sins before the Babyloni&s;h Captivity, nor all their Perver&s;ene&s;s afterwards, induce him to ca&s;t them off, and give up his De&s;ign. No. <HI>I am the Lord,</HI> &s;ays he; <HI>I change not,</HI> I abide by my original Plan: <HI>therefore ye Sons of Jacob,</HI> infinitely provoking as your Conduct is, <HI>are not con&s;umed. (Mal.</HI> iii. 6.) &mdash; <HI>He wrought for his great Name's Sake,</HI> thr&ocirc; the whole Affair. (<HI>Ezek.</HI> xx.) And his infinite Re&s;olution to ac|compli&s;h his glorious Plan, kept him immoveable, and finally carried him through, in Spite of all po&s;&s;ible Provocations from a mo&s;t ungrateful perver&s;e People even as he him&s;elf had declared, in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> ix. 7. when &s;peaking of this very thing, he &s;ays, <HI>The ZEAL of the Lord of Ho&s;ts will perform this.</HI></P>
<P>AND, as nothing could ever induce the unchangea+ble God to alter any of his Plans him&s;elf; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">God laid a Scheme to bring the <HI>Ninevites</HI> to Repentance. He &s;ent <HI>Jonah</HI> to preach, and threaten De&s;truction. The <HI>Ninevites</HI> are brought to Repentance, exactly according to his De&s;ign. So that he did not alter, but exactly ac|compli&s;h his Plan in that Ca&s;e. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of all other In&s;tances of the like Kind, recorded in Scrip|ture. Which however, are &s;ometimes, contrary to all Rea|&s;on, u&s;ed to prove, that the omni&s;cient God may, on new Views, alter his Purpo&s;es; when, in Fact, he would not be <HI>omni&s;cient,</HI> were he capable of &s;o much as <HI>one new Idea.</HI></NOTE> &s;o none of his Creatures were ever able to di&s;concert his Schemes. Jo&s;eph's Brethren attempted to do it in one In&s;tance, and Pharaoh &s;truggled &s;till much more to do it in another; but in both Ca&s;es all they did was over-ruled to accompli&s;h the Divine De&s;igns, to the be&s;t Advantage.&mdash; God had laid a Scheme to bring the Jews out of the Babyloni&s;h Captivity back again
<PB N="78" REF="008541_0085_102F6901CEE1C8B0">
to their own Land. The Thing looked, to them, al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible ever to be accompli&s;hed. They walk|ed in Darkne&s;s, and &s;aw no Light: <HI>Tru&s;t in the Lord, and &s;tay your &s;elves on your God,</HI> &s;aid the Almighty, &s;peaking of this very Thing. <HI>For my Coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and I will do all my Plea&s;ure.

<P>BESIDES, if we do but really and firmly believe the ab&s;olute Omni&s;cience and All-&s;ufficiency of Him, who is <HI>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</HI> we cannot but &s;ee the Rea&s;on of the Thing; and be &s;till farther a&s;&s;ured, that he can neither alter any of his Plans him&s;elf, nor po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;appointed by any of his Creatures. For, from Eternity, all po&s;&s;ible Plans lay open to his View, he had his Choice, he cho&s;e the be&s;t; and what in all Nature can induce him to alter his Choice, and prefer one not &s;o good? Upon after-Con&s;ideration we often have new Thoughts, or view Things in a different Light, and &s;o alter our Schemes for the better. But God has not had one new Idea &s;ince he has been in Exi&s;tence. From Eternity he exi&s;ted, and from Eternity all Things were perfectly in his View. It is therefore ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;hould ever &s;ee any Rea&s;on to change his Purpo&s;es; and equally impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;hould change them ab&s;o|lutely without any Rea&s;on at all. &mdash; And his infinite Wi&s;dom and almighty Power, whereby he is ab&s;o|lutely All-&s;ufficient, and able, with the greate&s;t Ea&s;e, to do <HI>according to his Plea&s;ure, in the Armies of Heaven, and among&s;t the Inhabitants of the Earth,</HI> renders it &s;imply impo&s;&s;ible that any of his Creatures, by Power or
<PB N="79" REF="008541_0086_102F690639F7EB88">
Policy, &s;hould be able to di&s;concert any of his Schemes. And <HI>this</HI> he knows; &mdash; and this lays a &s;olid Foundation for his perfect Tranquillity, and compleat Self-Enjoy|ment. And in the view of <HI>this</HI> he can be perfectly happy, and even without one unea&s;y Thought, at the Head of the Univer&s;e, let the Storms here below ri&s;e ever &s;o high. <HI>The Lord on high is mightier than the Noi&s;e of many Waters, yea, than the mighty Waves of the Sea. (P&s;al.</HI> xciii. 4.) And <HI>this</HI> renders him a fit Ob|ject of Tru&s;t, a &s;ecure <HI>Refuge</HI> to his People, <HI>tho' the Earth be removed, and the Mountains ca&s;t into the mid&s;t of the Sea. (P&s;al.</HI> xlvi. 1&mdash;7.) &mdash; But this leads me to add,</P>
<P N="4">4. BE firmly per&s;waded of the perfect and unchan|geable Happine&s;s of the holy One of I&s;rael. Or in other Words, Believe with all your Heart, that he is, not only in <HI>Name,</HI> but in <HI>deed</HI> and in <HI>truth, over all, God BLESSED FOR EVER.</HI> (Rom. ix. 5.)</P>

<P>So certain, therefore, as we are, that he is, in Fact, <HI>over all God BLESSED FOR EVER;</HI> ju&s;t &s;o certain may we be, that <HI>his Coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and he will do all his Plea&s;ure.</HI> And the whole Univer&s;e &s;hall <HI>know that he is the LORD,</HI> and the whole Sy&s;tem <HI>be filled with his Glory.</HI></P>
<P>AND the Omni&s;cient Almighty God, perfectly con&s;cious to all this, perfectly enjoys him&s;elf, ab&s;o|lutely &s;uperior to &s;o much as one uncomfortable Idea; and without the lea&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s, in perfect Tran|quillity, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an infinite Degree of Happine&s;s. Or to expre&s;s all in one Word, He is <HI>over all God ble&s;&s;ed for ever.&mdash; Of whom, and by whom, and to whom are all things; to whom be Glory for ever. Amen.</HI></P>
<P>AND what if we cannot &s;ee fully into the Rea&s;ons of the Divine Conduct in the Permi&s;&s;ion of Sin, &s;hall we think he has acted unwi&s;ely? Shall we think he
<PB N="81" REF="008541_0088_102F690BE42AB678">
does not mean to do what is be&s;t? Shall we give up the ab&s;olute Perfection of the Divine Nature? Shall we ungod our Maker? rather than &s;u&s;pect our own Judgment! &mdash;Or &s;hall we give up our belief of the perfect Happine&s;s of the infinitely glorious and ble&s;&s;ed God, and believe him to be a very mi&s;erable Being, rather than to think, that he can be plea&s;ed with that very Plan, which he has in Fact cho&s;en, before all po&s;&s;ible Plans? &mdash; Or if he is perfectly plea&s;ed with his own Plan, &s;hall we fly in his Face? Charge him with being the Author of Sin? and repre&s;ent the Devil, as the greate&s;t Saint; and God, as the greate&s;t Sinner? as you &s;eem to have, dear Sir, with dreadful boldne&s;s, ventured to do. (p. 16, 17.) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Were it natural to all Mankind, heartily to acquie&s;ce in all the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Providence, as being per|fectly wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t and good, excepting only the Per|mi&s;&s;ion of Sin, it would not &s;eem &s;o likely, at fir&s;t Glance, that the Fault was wholly in us in this Ca&s;e It would be an exempt, &s;trange Ca&s;e. And we might be more at a lo&s;s to account for it. But it is not at all uncommon or &s;trange for Mankind to di&s;like the Divine Conduct in other In&s;tances, as well as this. &mdash; Thus, it is a common Thing for the Cro&s;&s;es and Troubles of Life to &s;it heavy on the Spirits of Mankind. And a general Murmuring goes round the World. And Thou&s;ands think that none meet with &s;o much Trouble as them&s;elves: and that they have good Rea&s;on to be di&s;contented. Yet if they have good Rea&s;on to be di&s;contented, they are not to blame: but the Fault is in God, in who&s;e Hand the Rod is, and from whom all our Afflictions come &mdash; O how hard is it for many a one under great Afflictions to bring their Hearts &s;weetly to approve of the Divine Conduct, and love and ble&s;s the God that cha&s;ti&s;es them! O how difficult to get and maintain that Frame of Spirit, which holy <HI>Job</HI> expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e Words, <HI>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away: ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the Lord!</HI>&mdash;But whence ari&s;es all this Difficulty? Not from any Fault in God, all who&s;e Ways are wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t and good. It is really be&s;t, mo&s;t for the Honour of God and Good of Mankind, that this apo&s;tate Race, who have rebelled again&s;t the great King of the Univer&s;e, turned their Backs upon the God that made them, and are Idolizing the good Things of this World, &s;hould be thus cha&s;ti&s;ed, that they may know, that it is an evil and bitter Thing to di&s;|pi&s;e the Lord, to for&s;ake the Fountain of all Good, and be experimentally convinced that all Ci&s;terns are broken Ci&s;terns; and driven to an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to confe&s;s their Sin, humble them&s;elves, for&s;ake their Idols, and re|turn to the only true &amp; living God. But naturally we do not love to have our Hearts humbled, weaned from the World, and to have God for the alone Portion of our Souls. And as we do not like the Ends; &s;o we cannot be plea&s;ed with the Means. Did we like the one, the other might appear full of Wi&s;dom and Beauty. &mdash; If all the Di&s;|pen&s;ations of Providence were calculated to render us rich, honourable and happy, in the Fulne&s;s of all earthly good Things, no Reproach, no Sickne&s;s, no Lo&s;&s;es, no Troubles of any Kind, that this World might be our Heaven and our Home, this would &s;uit &s;uch ungodly, proud, worldly Hearts as ours naturally are: and we could love &s;uch a God, and think well of all his Ways. &mdash; But alas, be&s;ides all our pre&s;ent Troubles, we are &s;oon to die, leave this World we are &s;o fond of, and to go and appear be|fore our Judge, and receive according to our Deeds. This is &s;till more Shocking. O how glad would many be, if there was no &s;uch Thing as Death, and no &s;uch Day as the Day of Judgment! &mdash; But above all, nothing is &s;o dreadful as the eternal Torments of Hell. This &s;hocks Thou&s;ands &amp; Millions, and tempts them to call in Que&s;tion all the Divine Perfections. &mdash; E&s;pecially, when all this is threatened in God's Law, for the fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, for the lea&s;t Sin. (<HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 10.)</P>
<P>Now, if it is as difficult, to bring our Hearts to be recon|ciled to all this, as to God's permitting Sin; altho' in all the&s;e Particulars we mu&s;t own God's Conduct is wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t and good, or give up the whole of Divine Re|velation at once; have we not great Rea&s;on to think that there is &s;omething ami&s;s in our own Hearts? Some general Cau&s;e, which produces all the&s;e Effects? &mdash; And if we are indeed natively Enemies to God in the Temper of our Minds, as the Scriptures teach, it is not &s;trange that we &s;hould feel a general Di&s;like to all his Ways. If we are blind to his Glory, and regardle&s;s of his Honour, and unconcerned about the &s;piritual Good of the Sy&s;tem, the be&s;t Good of God's holy and eternal Kingdom; and at|tached only to our own particular, unholy and merely car|nal Intere&s;ts, it is not &s;trange that we &s;hould di&s;like the Divine Conduct towards the intellectual Sy&s;tem, as much as the I&s;raelites in the Wilderne&s;s did God's Conduct to|wards them. (<HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 5&mdash;11.) For alth&ocirc;, in the whole, greater Glory may be brought to God, and greater &s;piri|tual Good to the Sy&s;tem; yet if our Hearts naturally are not &s;uited with God's Ends, neither will they be with his Means: And &s;o his whole Plan, in Stead of appearing perfect in Wi&s;dom, Glory and Beauty, may look as dark and gloomy to us, as did the Divine Di&s;pen&s;ations to I&s;|rael of old. &mdash; On the whole, I think we have infinitely more Rea&s;on to believe, that the Fault is in us, than in God: and that it much better becomes us to &s;u&s;pect our own Hearts, than to "doubt whether God does what is mo&s;t for his own Glory" See the&s;e Sentiments more enlarged upon in my Sermons (p. 115&mdash;121, 192.)</P></NOTE> Wherefore,</P>

I pray you, lay it down for a Maxim, that Sin is in its own Nature, ju&s;t exactly the &s;ame abominable odi|ous Thing, and not one whit the better, becau&s;e God permits it to be, &amp; becau&s;e he intended, and becau&s;e he will overrule it to Good. &mdash;And believe it firmly, &amp; act upon it &s;teadily, that there is not the lea&s;t imaginable

<P><PB N="84" REF="008541_0091_102F6915ECAE2410">Is it not Pride, my Brother, un&s;ufferable Pride, in us, poor contemptible Worms, to get up into the Judgment-Seat, call Almighty God to our Bar, exa|mine his Conduct, and then boldly pronounce it bad? And publickly tell the World, that he has not done that "which is mo&s;t for his own Glory"? And all, becau&s;e we cannot &s;ee the Rea&s;ons of his Conduct; alth&ocirc; we know at the &s;ame time, that our Views are &s;o contracted, that we are no proper Judges; and that is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould prove his pre&s;ent Plan not to be the be&s;t?&mdash;Yea, to be &s;o engaged to &s;lur our Ma|ker's Conduct, as to be vexed with a fellow-Worm, who thinks it impo&s;&s;ible God &s;hould act unwi&s;ely, and would therefore &s;peak in behalf of the injured Maje&s;ty of Heaven, and plead his Cau&s;e, and en|deavour to ju&s;tify his Ways to Men? And with Indig|nation to cry out, "You have no Right to be &s;o <HI>violently confident,</HI> that the pre&s;ent Scheme is mo&s;t for God's Glory and the Good of the moral Sy&s;tem;" &mdash; "I can offer Rea&s;ons &s;ufficient to balance your's, and make the contrary appear highly probable!" (p. 5, 6.) For I think, I can prove "that in Fact, God does not do what is mo&s;t for his own Glory": And it is "a mere Fallacy" to pretend that he "is obliged to!" (p. 12, 13.)</P>
<P>I PRAY you, Sir, Give up this impious bla&s;phe|mous Principle, that "God does not do what is mo&s;t for his Glory." And if you think it Conde&s;cen&s;ion, pray conde&s;cend, at lea&s;t, &s;o far as to believe that God knows better than you do; and is infinitely more concerned, than you ever was, to do as well as he knows how. &mdash; You would think it an intolerable Reflection, if all your Acquaintance &s;hould join to give you this Character, <HI>viz.</HI> that in your daily Con|duct, and even in the mo&s;t important Affairs, you do not make Con&s;cience of acting according to your be&s;t Judgment.&mdash;O, blu&s;h, be a&s;hamed, and be confound|ed, and never open your Mouth to ju&s;tify the impious

<P>RATHER, let us &s;eek Divine Grace, from the God of all Grace, that our Hearts may be prepared to approve and love the Works and Ways of God, that when they &s;hall in the next World more fully open to our View, we may be ready to join the General A&s;&s;embly of Heaven, and cry, "AMEN, HALLE|LUJAH!" &mdash;O, let us get an Heart to love his Law, and to love the Go&s;pel of his Son, and hearti|ly approve the daily Di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence; all which, analogous to the whole of his univer&s;al Plan, are calculated to exalt God, and humble the Creature. And if we can but be heartily reconciled to tho&s;e Parts of the Divine Government, which are more near to our View; we &s;hall be prepared hear|tily to approve of tho&s;e Parts, which are more re|mote; yea, and of the whole.&mdash;For it is all of a Piece.</P>
<P>WHEN a Sinner is at fir&s;t &s;avingly converted, he &s;ees but a very &s;mall Part of God's univer&s;al Plan of Government; but what he &s;ees, he heartily ap|proves and loves. And &s;o he begins to be habitu|ally prepared to approve and love the whole. &mdash; He grows up into this Divine Temper. &mdash; At the Day of Judgment this Divine Temper will be perfect.&mdash;And &s;o then he will be perfectly prepared to approve, ad|mire, and with all his Heart love and delight in God's univer&s;al Plan; which then will be opened to the View of the intellectual Sy&s;tem. But tho&s;e, who when on Earth, had not the lea&s;t Di&s;po&s;ition to ap|prove and love any Part of God's moral Govern|ment, rightly under&s;tood, but were Enemies to God,

<P>IT had been infinitely wi&s;er for the I&s;raelites in the Wilderne&s;s, to have &s;pent their Time in Prayer to God, than in murmuring again&s;t him. Their Cor|ruptions made them &s;o blind, that they could not &s;ee: and then they laid all the Blame upon God. For which, God doom'd them to wander and fall in the Wilderne&s;s, and never reach the holy Land. &mdash; And they were <HI>our En&s;amples;</HI> and the&s;e Things were <HI>writ|ten for our In&s;truction.</HI>&mdash;O, therefore, my Brother, let us in this benighted World, how dark &s;oever things appear, not cavil again&s;t any of the Ways of God; but rather humbly cry to him for divine Grace, to enable us to believe, throughly to believe, that "&s;upreme Wi&s;dom cannot err;" And accordingly, "heartily to acquie&s;ce in the Di&s;pen&s;ations of &s;upreme Wi&s;dom; and humbly admire and adore, where we cannot fully comprehend;" in a firm Belief that all the Affairs of the Univer&s;e are by him conducted in &s;uch an infinitely perfect Manner, as that when "full Day &s;hall be poured on all the Ways and Works of God," they will appear in &s;uch a Light as to bring the greate&s;t Glory to God, and Good to the Sy&s;tem; and

&s;o fill all holy Beings with "un&s;peakable Joy," and the mo&s;t exalted Thoughts of God.
