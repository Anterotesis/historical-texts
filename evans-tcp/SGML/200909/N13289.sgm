<P>PERHAPS the following little Poem may be con&s;idered with the more indulgence by the Public, after it is known, that it was actually writ|ten, at a period when the Army was in the field, and the Author &s;o far engaged in the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion, as to have but little lei&s;ure for &s;ubjects of literature or amu&s;ement. And it will not be nece&s;&s;a|ry to demon&s;trate to tho&s;e who have the lea&s;t know|ledge of a military life, how unfavourable &s;uch a a &s;tate is to poetical contemplation. This, it is pre|&s;umed, may pertinently be urged in excu&s;e for the &s;lighter errors, and inaccuracies of the performance; and the De&s;ign mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure atone, for any of a different complexion.</P>
<P>To in&s;pire our Countrymen now in arms, or who may hereafter be called into the field, with per&s;eve|rance and fortitude, thro' every &s;pecies of difficulty and danger, to continue their exertions for the de|fence of their country, and the pre&s;ervation of its Liberties, is the object of this Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, it was imagined, no con&s;iderati|ons could be more effectual, than the recollection of the pa&s;t, and the anticipation of the future. For where is the man to be found, who, after all that has been done and &s;uffered; after &s;uch a profu&s;ion of blood, and trea&s;ure has been expended; and &s;uch important advantages have been obtained; would ba&s;ely relinqui&s;h, and leave unfini&s;hed the illu&s;trious ta&s;k of <HI>rearing</HI> an EMPIRE, which from its &s;ituation, and circum&s;tances, mu&s;t &s;urpa&s;s all that ever have exi&s;ted, in magnitude, felicity and duration?</P>
<P>Altho' the Author entertains the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of the gratitude and liberality, with which the Continent will reward tho&s;e who have li|terally
<PB N="6" REF="016801_0004_0F9E79F9405382E8">
borne the heat and burden of the day of war; he has not in&s;i&s;ted on tho&s;e pecuniary or &s;lighter con&s;iderations: but has attempted, to turn the at|tention, to the future grandeur, happine&s;s, and glory of the Country, for which we are now contending. &mdash;The lands already granted to the Army, fir&s;t &s;ug|ge&s;ted the idea of a military &s;ettlement on the Ohio, or in &s;ome of tho&s;e We&s;tern regions; who&s;e beauties can never be &s;ufficiently di&s;played, much le&s;s exaggerated by de&s;cription. The mild tempe|rature and &s;erenity of the air, the &s;alubrity of the climate, the fertility of the &s;oil, the luxuriance of its products, the extent of territory, and the amaz|ing inland navigation, which tho&s;e boundle&s;s lakes, and immea&s;urable rivers will open; cannot fail one day, to equal that garden of the world to the re|pre&s;entation given of it, in the conclu&s;ion of the Poem. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a Country, (re&s;cued from the hand of inva&s;ion) in a perfect &s;tate of free|dom and &s;ecurity, will be a glorious compen&s;ation for all our toils and &s;ufferings, and a monument of the mo&s;t unparalell'd bravery and patrioti&s;m to the remote&s;t po&s;terity.&mdash;Stimulated with the love of glory, allured by the&s;e delightful pro&s;pects, and animated with the plea&s;ing hope of the &s;peedy fru|ition of tho&s;e rapturous &s;cenes; there are thou&s;ands who have drawn the &s;word, with a re&s;olution never to &s;heath it, until a happy period is put to the con|te&s;t.&mdash;For him&s;elf, the Writer declares, that hav|ing already devoted, whatever talents and abilities nature has conferred upon him, to the &s;ervice of his Country; no efforts that can be made with his voice, his pen, or his &s;word, &s;hall ever be wanting to confirm its LIBERTIES and INDEPENDENCE.</P>
