<P>_CONSIDERING the va&s;t Importance of the Mini&s;terial Office, and what are like to be the happy or unhappy Con&s;equences of a faithful or unfaithful Di&s;charge of it; there is great Need that every Argument be u&s;ed, that may mo&s;t powerfully excite to Mini&s;terial Faithfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>And, as on the one Hand, a ju&s;t View of the glorious Re|ward, con&s;equent upon a right Di&s;charge of the Duties of that important Office, will, (its likely) prove an animating Motive to Mini&s;terial Faithfulne&s;s; So on the other, to con&s;ider aright the many and great Difficulties which attend the faithful Exerci&s;e of this Office, may have the like Tendency.</P>
<P>Such a View &s;ea&s;onably taken at the Entry of the &s;acred Office, may prevent Mini&s;ters from repenting of their Un|dertaking, or from looking back after having put their Hands to the Plough.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="007454_0004_102D91DF4B327C50">
A right View of the&s;e Difficulties, and counting the Co&s;t before Hand, may prevent the unhappy Fate of the fooli&s;h Man, who began to build, but was not able to fini&s;h. This, by the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, may quicken Mini&s;ters to apply to their Work with Vigour and Re&s;olution; may excite them to put on the whole Armour of God, and to take all due Care to be well equiped for the important Service they are to be engaged in. With a View therefore to promote the&s;e good Effects, I propo&s;e by divine Help, to introduce the pre&s;ent Solemnity, by &s;aying &s;omewhat of the Difficulties that attend the fatihful Di&s;charge of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try; and to that End, have cho&s;en the Words now read, as the Subject of Di&s;cour&s;e, where the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Thou therefore endure Hardne&s;s as a good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>This Text and Context, contain an Addre&s;s of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> to the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Timothy;</HI> in which, he gives him a Number and Variety of nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ea&s;onable Directions, with Re&s;pect to his fulfilling the &s;everal Parts of his important Office; particularly the fir&s;t Ver&s;e, he applies to him in the&s;e Words, <HI>Thou therefore my Son, be &s;trong in the Grace which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, Be &s;trong:</HI> i. e. be &s;tout and couragious, fear not any Enemy, or Oppo&s;ition thou may&s;t meet with in the faithful Execution of thine Office. <HI>In the Grace which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> q. d. don't depend upon thy own Strength, or natural Courage; but place thy whole Confidence in the gracious Influence and Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Remember that it is in him that thou ha&s;t both Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Strength; that all thy Springs are in this ble&s;&s;ed Head of In|fluence; and that without Him thou can&s;t do nothing. Then in the &s;econd Ver&s;e, he gives the Evangeli&s;t Direction con|cerning the important Work of &s;etting apart fit Per&s;ons to the Office of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try. <HI>The Things that thou ha&s;t heard of me before many Witne&s;&s;es:</HI> i. e. The Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, and the Office of the Mini&s;try, which have been by me committed to thy Tru&s;t: the many Witne&s;&s;es before whom this was done, has Re&s;pect to the numerous Spectators who were pre&s;ent at the Evangeli&s;t's Ordination. The <HI>&s;ame commit thou to faithful Men:</HI> q. d. Take good Care, not only how thou fulfille&s;t thy own Mini&s;try, but al&s;o who thou intro|duce&s;t into the Mini&s;try; that they into who&s;e Hands the &s;a|cred Depo&s;itum is committed, be not only faithful, but able. Labour to have all the Evidence that the Nature of the Ca&s;e will admit of, not only that they be Per&s;ons who have an hone&s;t Intention, but al&s;o that they are in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure
<PB N="3" REF="007454_0005_102D71EDADEE06B0">qualified to &s;peak as becomes the Oracles of God, and to perform the other Parts of that weighty Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Then in the Text he proceeds to &s;ay, <HI>Thou therefore endure Hardne&s;s as a good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Here's a Duty ex|horted to, and the Manner in which it is to be done. The Duty we have in that Precept, <HI>endure Hardne&s;s,</HI> or as it might be literally rendered from the original <HI>Super-evil, viz.</HI> the Evil of Affliction: q. d. Expect a Number and Variety of Difficulties in the faithful Exerci&s;e of thy Mini&s;try, and be ready to encounter them with Chri&s;tian Fortitude, and to bear them with Equanimity and Patience.</P>
<P>The Manner in which the Duty is to be done, we have in the&s;e Words, <HI>As a good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> q. d. to excite thee to endure Hardne&s;s with the more Patience, Thou mu&s;t remember that the Life of a Mini&s;ter, is not a Life of Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure; but on the contrary, a Life of Warfare, the Life of a Soldier; that Mini&s;ters in the faithful Exerci&s;e of their Mini&s;try, may rationally lay their Account with the Dangers, the Fatigues and Encounters of a long and hazardous Campaign.</P>
<P>The Subject being thus introduced and explained, in di&s;|cour&s;ing more largely upon it, I &s;hall
<LIST>
<ITEM>I&s;t, Point to &s;ome of tho&s;e Things that Mini&s;ters may rationally lay their Account to meet with, in the faithful Exerci&s;e of their Office; which will require their <HI>en|during Hardne&s;s.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IIdly. I &s;hall mention &s;ome of tho&s;e Qualitications which are mainly nece&s;&s;ary, in Order to their <HI>enduring Hard|ne&s;s,</HI> or encountring the Difficulties they may expect to meet. And then make Application.</ITEM>

<P>And according to the propo&s;ed Method,</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to point to &s;everal of tho&s;e Things, that it is likely Mini&s;ters will meet with, in the Exerci&s;e of their Mini&s;try, which will require their <HI>enduring Hardne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>And here I would ob&s;erve in general, that they may in the whole of their Mini&s;terial Work, expect to meet with tho&s;e Things which will require their <HI>enduring Hardne&s;s.</HI> For
<PB N="4" REF="007454_0006_102D91E66264E6B0">con&s;ider, that the pre&s;ent State of the vi&s;ible Church is mili|tant; Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples while here in this World, are in a State of War, and need to put on the whole Armour of God, that they may fight the good Fight of Faith. The Church in the pre&s;ent State is like a Flock of Sheep among Wolves; &s;he has her Situation among Lions Dens, and the Mountains of Leopards. Believers, at pre&s;ent, are in a World that hates them, <HI>Job.</HI> 15.19. <HI>They have many Enemies, and the&s;e hate them with a cruel hatred, P&s;al.</HI> 25.19. This Enmity began to break out very early in the Murder of righteous <HI>Abel,</HI> by his own Brother: <HI>and wherefore &s;lew he him?</HI> The Apo&s;tle tells us, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 3.12. <HI>Becau&s;e his own Works were Evil, and his Brother's Righ|teous.</HI> And it has been manife&s;ting it &s;elf in every Age &s;ince the&s;e Words of God were pronounced. Gen. 3.15. <HI>I will put Enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed:</HI> in &s;o much, that in every Age, there has been Occa&s;ion for the Apo&s;tle's Ob&s;ervation, Gal. 4.29, <HI>But as then he that was born after the Fle&s;h, per&s;ecuted him that was born after the Spirit,</HI> even &s;o it is now.</P>
<P>Our Lord tells his Di&s;ciples, that in the World they &s;hall have Tribulation; <HI>and that through much Tribulation they may expect to enter into the Kingdom of God:</HI> And what he told them, they have found true. Hence it is ob&s;ervable, that the World has proven an unkind Step-Dame to our Lord him&s;elf, and to many of his deare&s;t Followers. The P&s;almi&s;t was not the only Saint who has had Rea&s;on to complain, as <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 120.5. <HI>Wo is me that I am in Me&s;hech, and that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar;</HI> or to &s;ay as <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 57.4. <HI>My Soul is among fierce Lions, and I dwell with them that are &s;et on Fire.</HI> Believers in the pre|&s;ent State have not only Men, but Devils to oppo&s;e them; they have to encounter all the Legions of Hell, with Satan at their Head; <HI>they wre&s;tle not again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood only, but al&s;o again&s;t Principalities and Powers, again&s;t the Rulers of the Darkne&s;s of this World, again&s;t &s;piritual Wickedne&s;s in high Places.</HI> Eph. 6.12.</P>
<P>And as the pre&s;ent State of the Church is militant, &s;o Mini&s;ters are Officers in this War, under Chri&s;t the Captain of Salvation: It is their Bu&s;ine&s;s to animate and direct Chri&s;t's Soldiers to lead them out to Action; and while they are doing &s;o, not to &s;hrink back them&s;elves for fear of Danger; but to jeopard their Lives in the high Places of the Field, and if Need be, bravely to expo&s;e them&s;elves in the Fore-front of the hotte&s;t Battle, and to make a re&s;olute Stand again&s;t the united Powers of Earth and Hell.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="007454_0007_102D91E856A7F510">
And as in the heat of a Battle, we &s;ee that the Enemy do endeavour principally to &s;lay their Adver&s;ary's Officers, &s;o it is not to be doubted but that the Devil and his Party will bend their chief Force again&s;t the Officers in Chri&s;t's Army. What our Lord &s;ays to <HI>Peter,</HI> is applicable in a peculiar Sen&s;e to every faithful Mini&s;ter, <HI>Luk.</HI> 22.31. <HI>Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath de&s;ired to have you, that he may &s;ift you as Wheat.</HI> He who was bold enough to attack the Captain of our Salvation, in the Manner we read of, <HI>Matt.</HI> 4.1&mdash;11, will no doubt, as far as he is permitted, try every Method with Mini&s;ters, that he may either over-power them by Force, or circumvent them by Fraud.</P>
<P>From this general View of the Ca&s;e, you may ea&s;ily &s;ee that Mini&s;ters in the Exerci&s;e of their Office, will need to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s.</HI> But I would be larger on this Head, endea|vouring to point to &s;everal of the particular Things which will require their <HI>enduring Haadne&s;s.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Oppo&s;ition, and the bitter Scoffs they may expect to meet with, in their faithful laying down the Scheme of Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, will call for their <HI>enduring Hardne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, there is nothing in this Scheme of Salvation which de&s;erves Oppo&s;ition, or which is by any Means a fit Object of Ridicule: On the contrary, it is the mo&s;t benevo|lent, and withal the wi&s;e&s;t De&s;ign. It is full of <HI>Benevolence</HI> and breathes nothing but Love and Compa&s;&s;ion to guilty pol|luted peri&s;hing Creatures, in next Subordination to the Glory of God, according to <HI>Luk.</HI> 2.14; Peace and Pardon, and Holine&s;s, high Honours and &s;pecial Favours, to the mo&s;t un|worthy Rebels. In a Word, con&s;idering the Benevolence of the De&s;ign&punc; it might rea&s;onably be expected that the Go&s;pel, in&s;tead of Oppo&s;ition, would meet with a univer&s;al Welcome; that every Hou&s;e, and every Heart would be open to receive the Saviour. <HI>It is certainly a faithful Saying, and worthy of all Accepta|tion, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the World to &s;ave the chief of Sinners.</HI> 1 Tim. 1.15. And as it is a benevolent, &s;o it is a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> De|&s;ign: the Device of Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, contains in it the brighte&s;t Di&s;play of divine Wi&s;dom that ever the World was acquainted with; &s;o far is it from having any Thing fooli&s;h or weak in it, any Thing that is a proper Object of Ridicule: Every Thing in the glorious Plan of the New-Covenant, is &s;o well ordered, as to be worthy of a Being of infinite Perfection. Here's Wi&s;dom enough and enough, to
<PB N="6" REF="007454_0008_102D91EA4ADC7CB0">employ the riche&s;t &s;peculative human Mind. Nay, the Angels of Heaven, though not &s;o nearly intere&s;ted as Men are, yet they admire the manifold Wi&s;dom of God herein manife&s;ted, and love to pry into it. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.12. But then it is likewi&s;e true, that the Glory and Beauty of the New-Covenant. Way of Redemption, and the excellent Wi&s;dom therein di&s;played, are not di&s;cerned by carnal Eyes: With Re&s;pect to them, it is called <HI>hidden Wi&s;dom, the Wi&s;dom of God in a My&s;tery, which none of the Princes of this World knew.</HI> 1 Cor. 2.7. Hence the Apo&s;tle had Occa&s;ion to &s;ay as he does, 1 Cor. 1.23. <HI>We preach Chri&s;t crucified, to the Jews a &s;tumbling Block, and to the Greeks Fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> He who &s;aid &s;o, altho' perhaps one of the be&s;t Preachers that ever opened a Mouth, was yet counted a Babbler, when he preached Je&s;us, and the Re&s;urrection from the Dead.</P>
<P>And as the Minds of Men are naturally the &s;ame now that they were &s;eventeen Hundred Years ago, &s;o the Go&s;pel is apt to meet with the &s;ame Treatment; and this not only from <HI>Jews, Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Heathens,</HI> but al&s;o from profe&s;s'd Chri&s;|tians. Natural Men, however they may be born and brought up under a Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation, yet they cannot &s;ee into &s;everal of the important Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity. As for In&s;tance, they can't &s;ee into the Doctrines of ab&s;olute Decrees, or Original Sin: How an ab&s;olute Predetermination is con|&s;i&s;tent with human Liberty: How it is ju&s;t or po&s;&s;ible that by the Di&s;obedience of one many &s;hould be made Sinners: Or that by the Offence of one Judgment &s;hould come on all to Condemnation. How it is con&s;i&s;tent either with infinite Wi&s;dom or Ju&s;tice, that a Sinner &s;hould be ju&s;tified by im|puted Righteou&s;ne&s;s; or that the Ju&s;t &s;hould &s;uffer for the Unju&s;t, that he might bring Sinners to God. They can't &s;ee into the Doctrine of Regeneration, as importing the Super|natural Production and in&s;tantaneous Implantation of a new living Principle of Action in the Soul, operating &s;o powerfully as to produce an immediate Change in all the Faculties.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and other the peculiar Doctrines of our holy Reli|gion, are Fooli&s;hne&s;s to them, and the Objects of their hearty Aver&s;ion. And therefore he who will preach them up, with faithful Boldne&s;s, and apply them with Clo&s;ene&s;s, may expect the Trial, at lea&s;t, of cruel Mockings; and very probably will meet with &s;uch Oppo&s;ition and Contradiction, as will demand all the Chri&s;tian Fortitude he is Ma&s;ter of, to bear up under them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="007454_0009_102D91EC8BEF2918">
2. The clo&s;e and painful Application they &s;hould give to their private Studies, will require their <HI>enduring Hardne&s;s.</HI> There is a Number and Variety of Acquirements, needful to qualify for the Work of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, which cannot be attained, without clo&s;e Application to Study. It were to be wi&s;hed, (if practicable) that Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel were vers'd in all the various Parts of &s;olid, u&s;eful Learning: That they were expert in the whole Compa&s;s of Science, and what is known by the Name of univer&s;al Scholars, But this, with Re&s;pect to Mini&s;ters in general, is, (I own) rather to be wi&s;h|ed for, than expected; e&s;pecially in a young Country, where Things are yet, as it were, in <HI>Embrio,</HI> or in an infant State. But even in our pre&s;ent State, Mini&s;ters &s;hould have &s;ome Com|petency of human Learning: as for In&s;tance, It is at lea&s;t highly expedient, that the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter under&s;tood &s;o much of Grammar and Rhetorick, as to know &s;omewhat of the Congruity and Elegancy of Language: That he have &s;uch an In&s;ight into Logick and Metaphy&s;icks, as that he be capable of making proper Di&s;tinctions of knowing when an Argument is, or is not conclu&s;ive; of rea&s;oning with &s;ome Pertinency and Clearne&s;s of detecting Sophi&s;ms, and of Ab&s;tracting: That he did at lea&s;t know &s;o much of Mathematicks, as to render him capable of reading Books of natural Philo&s;ophy, with Under&s;tanding: That he be well acquainted with moral Phi|lo&s;ophy, and with Hi&s;tory, ancient and modern, civil and ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic; e&s;pecially, it is needful that he be acquainted with Divinity, Polemick and Sy&s;tematick, as well as Practical.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Acquirements are not to be attained without Study, yea, much Study, which <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, is a Weari|ne&s;s of the Fle&s;h. Many an one has endured that Hardne&s;s, by clo&s;e Application to Study, that has brought on Di&s;ea&s;e, and ha&s;tned Death in the Meridian of Life.</P>
<P>But this is not all: as the Study he pro&s;ecutes in order to attain mini&s;terial Qualifications, will require his <HI>enduring Hard|ne&s;s;</HI> &s;o al&s;o will that, to which he behoves, to apply him&s;elf in the Exerci&s;e of his Office. A con&s;ciencious Mini&s;ter can't allow him&s;elf to put off People with a rude impremeditated extemporary Effu&s;ion: On the contrary, he con&s;iders that the Intere&s;t of Souls is at Stake; one of which, is of more Value than a World be&s;ides: That his Preaching is about Matters of infinite Moment; that he is like to be the Savour of Life unto Life, or of Death unto Death; the mo&s;t glorious Life, or the mo&s;t dreadful Death, to them that hear him. And
<PB N="8" REF="007454_0010_102D91EE6D3B1DE8">under the Influence of &s;uch Con&s;iderations, he dare not offer to the Lord what co&s;t him Nothing; but though it &s;hould be a Wearine&s;s to the Fle&s;h, he gives him&s;elf to clo&s;e Study, that by this Means he may bring beaten Oyl, to cau&s;e the Lamps to burn. The Fore&s;ight that this may &s;oon wear out animal Nature, and ha&s;ten temporal Death, don't at all deter him; he had much rather it &s;hould be work'd out in &s;uch Employ|ment, than in any other; and hence he gives him&s;elf to Reading, to Meditation and to Doctrine; and deeply &s;en&s;ible that he can't prepare for the publick Service of the Sanctuary by his own Study, he's much in Clo&s;et Devotion, often plead|ing with the Father of Lights, that he would enable him to find out acceptable Words, directing him to &s;ea&s;onable Sub|jects, and the mo&s;t profitable Way of pro&s;ecuting them. In a Word, he who will make Con&s;cience of private Preparation for the publick Exerci&s;e of the Mini&s;try, will find Need to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s</HI> in this Re&s;pect.</P>
<P N="3">3. Faithful Reproof is another Part of his Work, in the Exerci&s;e of which the Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter will need to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s,</HI> and has Occa&s;ion for much holy Courage. Reproving and Rebuking are Parts of the Mini&s;terial Office, as well as Exhorting, 2 Tim. 4.2. <HI>He mu&s;t cry aloud, and not &s;pare, lifting up his Voice like a Trumpet in &s;hewing God's People their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and the Hou&s;e of</HI> Jacob <HI>their Sins,</HI> I&s;ai. 58.1. Yea, if there be Occa&s;ion for it, he mu&s;t rebuke &s;harply, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.13. Yea, he mu&s;t not only reprove publickly from the Pulpit, but when there is Occa&s;ion for it, he is to practice private per&s;onal Rebuke. The faithful Mini&s;ter mu&s;t not allow him&s;elf to re&s;pect Per&s;ons, or to give flattering Titles to Men; but mu&s;t faithfully reprove the Vices of the great, as well as of the &s;mall. Though the Per&s;on that needs the Reproof be one in great Power; one who has the E&s;tate, or even the Life of the Reprover at his Di&s;po&s;al, yet this mu&s;t not hinder him from a faithful Di&s;|charge of his Duty. The Bapti&s;t is herein a &s;hining Pattern; he was no Stranger to the tyrannical Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Herod.</HI> It is not unlike that he was &s;en&s;ible that he ran the Ri&s;que of lo&s;ing his Head; and yet all this don't deter him from re|proving the Tyrant, on Account of his abominable ince&s;tuous Marriage. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t follow &s;uch an Example as this at their Peril; they mu&s;t put their &s;ecular Intere&s;ts, and even their Lives in their Hand, leaving the Con&s;equence to God. They mu&s;t &s;ometimes mini&s;ter tho&s;e Reproofs which perhaps will be galling to the Con&s;ciences of wicked Men, though they &s;hould like the Murderers of <HI>Stephen</HI> be cut to
<PB N="9" REF="007454_0011_102D91F35CC54BA0">the Heart, or angry even to Madne&s;s. It's true, the faithful Mini&s;ter is to take Care that his Reproofs be wi&s;ely di&s;pen&s;ed, with Re&s;pect to Time, Place, Manner and other Circum&s;tances. He is al&s;o carefully to avoid Bitterne&s;s, to &s;hun the Spirit even of a <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when he &s;aid, <HI>Hear now ye Rebels, mu&s;t we bring you Water out of this Rock.</HI> In a Word, he &s;hould endeavour to apply the&s;e Cau&s;ticks, with all that Tenderne&s;s, that the Na|ture of the Operation will admit of. But on the other Hand, he had Need to take Care, lea&s;t under the Colour of Prudence or Tenderne&s;s, he &s;hould be unfaithful.</P>
<P>This is another Branch of the &s;acred Office, in which the Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter will have much Need to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s.</HI> He will be apt &s;ometimes (it is likely) to have the Mortifica|tion of finding, that altho' the Reproof has been admini&s;tred with all po&s;&s;ible Wi&s;dom and Tenderne&s;s; yet by his Faith|fulne&s;s, he has lo&s;t the Good-will of the Reproved, who is become his Enemy for telling him the Truth, and ever after bears him a Grudge, and is ready to do him a Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter needs to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s,</HI> in oppo&s;ing Errors and Errori&s;ts. The Apo&s;tle tells us, 1 Cor. 11.19, <HI>That there mu&s;t be Here&s;ies, that they that are approved may be made manife&s;t.</HI> Sometimes we &s;ee the &s;overeign and all-wi&s;e God, who&s;e Ways are pa&s;t finding out, does for &s;ome End worthy of him&s;elf, &s;ee fit to permit fal&s;e Teachers to enter into his Church; Per&s;ons who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to corrupt the Word of God, and who are indu&s;trious to draw away Di&s;ci|ples after them. It may be, the Errors they promote, though of a very dangerous Nature, eating like a Canker, and threat|ning the Vitals of Chri&s;tianity; yet are &s;o &s;peciou&s;ly guilded, that the Poi&s;on is not ea&s;ily di&s;cerned; fair Pretences are made of Zeal for God; and &s;uch guileful Methods u&s;ed, that with good Words and fair Speeches, the Simple are in great Dan|ger of being deceived.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a State of Things, that Mini&s;ter who would expect to be owned <HI>as a good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t exert him|&s;elf; he mu&s;t not &s;ee grievous Wolves entring in, not &s;par|ing the Flock, or the little Foxes &s;poiling the tender Vine: and in the mean Time &s;tand by as an unconcern'd Spectator; but when he &s;ees Men ari&s;ing, and hears them &s;peaking per|ver&s;e Things, to draw away Di&s;ciples, he &s;hould con&s;ider him|&s;elf as &s;et for the Defence of the Go&s;pel, and not fly, leaving Chri&s;t's Sheep in the Power of Wolves; but to contend ear|ne&s;tly
<PB N="10" REF="007454_0012_102D91F5F9BDA978">for the Faith once delivered to the Saints, endeavouring with all Learning and &s;ound Doctrine, to convince the Gain|&s;ayers; u&s;ing his be&s;t Skill to e&s;tabli&s;h the Flock in the labour|ing Truths of the Day, and to reduce any that are wavering, and begin to be drawn a&s;ide from their Stedfa&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. Mini&s;ters need to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s,</HI> in that careful Watch they are to keep over the Flock. Chri&s;t's Flock have much need of a careful Watch over them, con&s;idering what fooli&s;h Sheep they are, how apt to go a&s;tray, and what vigilant, &s;ub|tle Enemies are engaged again&s;t them: And hence, although their chief Safety is owing to the omni&s;cient Eye of him that &s;lumbers not, nor &s;leeps, which is con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed about them, without which, the Watchmen would watch in vain; yet it has plea&s;ed the great Keeper of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to appoint his Mini&s;ters in the Station of Watchmen, Ezek. 3.17. <HI>Son of Man, I have made thee a Watchman to the Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael. So likewi&s;e, I&s;a. 62.6. <HI>I have &s;et Watchmen on thy Walls, O</HI> Jeru|&s;alem, <HI>that &s;hall never hold their Peace, Day nor Night;</HI> and in the Exerci&s;e of this Part of their Office, they are to guard again&s;t Drou&s;ine&s;s. That's a &s;ad Character which we have of the Watchman of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> I&s;a. 56.10. viz. <HI>Sleeping, lying down, loving to Slumber.</HI> As the Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t would be owned by his divine Ma&s;ter at la&s;t, he &s;hould take Care that this Character be not applicable to him. And in order hereto, he &s;hould have his Eyes where <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us the wife Man's are, <HI>viz.</HI> in his Head; carefully ob&s;erving the State of the Church, what are the Practices of her Enemies again&s;t her. In a Word, heedfully noticing what are the Phenomena of the natural, the moral, and the religious World; &s;o as to be always qualified to give a right An&s;wer to that Que&s;tion, <HI>Watchman, what of the Night?</HI> Now this is a Work which will require great Steadine&s;s and Application of Mind: And tho&s;e who will di&s;charge it faithfully, will, (I believe) be often awake in a natural Sen&s;e, when the Flock in that Sen&s;e are a&s;leep.</P>
<P N="6">6. There is a great Variety of Labours belonging to the Mini&s;terial Office, be&s;ides what we have already touched upon, which will require their <HI>enduring Hardne&s;s.</HI> Preaching the Go&s;pel is a very laborious Work, as might be ea&s;ily &s;een, had we Time to view the Nature of it. To hold forth the Love of God to Sinners in it's Origin and fir&s;t Spring, <HI>viz.</HI> free &s;overeign Grace; to open up the Nature of that Redemp|tion purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t; to &s;hew what a wi&s;e, gracious, glorious Device the New-Covenant-Way of Salvation is;
<PB N="11" REF="007454_0013_102D91F80E711908">what a glorious Con&s;tellation of divine Perfections do &s;hine forth in it; how well ordered it is in all Things; how wor|thy in every Re&s;pect of it's divine Author: To di&s;play aright the Manner of the Application of this precious Redemption: To preach the Terrors of the Law to awakened Sinners; repre&s;enting Hell naked before them, and De&s;truction without a Covering; &s;hewing them what a fearful Thing it is to fall into the Hands of the living God: To direct awakened en|quiring Souls the right Way to Chri&s;t, &s;teering them &s;afe by tho&s;e fatal Rocks, upon which many Souls have been wrecked and finally lo&s;t: To preach &s;o as to &s;uit a great Variety of Ca&s;es among Believers, feeding Chri&s;t's Sheep, and feeding his Lambs; giving Milk to Babes, and &s;trong Meat to them who have their Sen&s;es exerci&s;ed: To make a judicious Choice of pertinent Subjects, well adapted to the Times, that may lead not only to Truth, but &s;ea&s;onable Truth: To be in&s;tant in Sea&s;on, and out of Sea&s;on, not willingly lo&s;ing any Oppor|tunity that pre&s;ents of &s;erving Chri&s;t and Souls: To take due Care not only as to the Matter, but al&s;o as to the Style and Manner of delivering divine Truth; with the Preacher &s;eek|ing to find out acceptable Words, u&s;ing all the Arts of per|&s;uading and animating; and leaving no Mean une&s;&s;ay'd to convince the Judgments, and gain the Hearts of Men. This is Labour! this is Work! And he who will follow it faith|fully, mu&s;t <HI>endure Hardne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not all: they who think the Whole of a Mini&s;ter's Work is confined to the Pulpit, and his Preparations for it, do greatly mi&s;take the Nature of it: How &s;hall he know what to preach, except he know the State of the Flock? And how can he know this &s;ufficiently, without taking Pains to know it? 'Tis needful therefore that he &s;pend &s;ome convenient Part of his Time, not only in occa&s;ional Vi&s;its to the Sick, and upon other Emergencies; but al&s;o in &s;tated Vi&s;itation and Catechi&s;ing, examining the Flock as to their Advances in Knowledge, and conferring freely with them about Soul-Mat|ters; &s;tirring up the ignorant and carele&s;s, warning the unruly, comforting the feeble-minded, &s;upporting the weak; teaching not only publickly, but al&s;o from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, <HI>Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I might al&s;o have mentioned the exerci&s;e of the Key of <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> a Part of the mini&s;terial Office, which is often at|tended with great Difficulty, and which requires much holy Courage, Impartiality and Faithfulne&s;s, as well as Wi&s;dom:
<PB N="12" REF="007454_0014_102D91FA992B8AE0">as likewi&s;e, the admini&s;tring the Seals of the Covenant, which &s;uppo&s;es an Enquiry into the Qualifications of the Subjects of the&s;e Seals: A Work this, which &s;ome Mini&s;ters I know find very weighty and difficult. In a Word, he who will faithfully apply him&s;elf to the various Labours of the mini&s;te|rial Office, will be apt to find it a Work of great and &s;ore Labour and Fatigue.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter will need to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s,</HI> in bearing up under &s;inking Di&s;couragements, which are apt to attend him in the Exerci&s;e of his Office. Some Mini&s;ters have more of the&s;e than others; but I believe none are in|tirely exempt from them, and &s;ome feel the&s;e to be many and great; Sometimes they feel the Weight of Souls lying on their Spirits, with an almo&s;t in&s;upportable Pre&s;&s;ure; they feel a Degree of the &s;ame catholic Concern, which the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.29. The general Intere&s;t of Chri&s;tianity lies near their Hearts; and it may be, they have the Affliction to &s;ee Religion low, corrupting Errors prevailing, practical Godline&s;s much decay'd, and Matter daily tending from bad to wor&s;e; &s;o that the Things that remain, are even ready to die. Upon &s;uch a melancholly View of Things, the faithful Mini&s;ter cannot &s;tand by as an unconcern'd Spectator: His &s;eeing <HI>Zion</HI> in this Condition, will cau&s;e him to <HI>bang his Harp on the Willow;</HI> his Heart trembles for the Ark of God; he cannot prevent a good Deal of Dejection of Soul, and it may be, he feels &s;carce enough of Faith in Exerci&s;e, to breathe out faintly &s;uch a Petition as that, Amos 7.2. <HI>O Lord God, forgive, I be&s;eech thee: By whom &s;hall</HI> Jacob <HI>ari&s;e? for he is &s;mall.</HI> Again, &s;ometimes his Heart is ready to die within him, to &s;ee &s;o little Appearance of Fruit following his mini&s;terial Labours; to think that there is a &s;ad Probability that he &s;hall prove the Savour of Death unto Death to &s;ome Per&s;ons, that are very dear to him; that he mu&s;t appear before Chri&s;t's Judgment-Seat, and bear Witne&s;s again&s;t them, that they de&s;pi&s;ed the Grace of the Go&s;pel, and trampled under Foot the great Salvation. O! it is a cutting Thought. Sometimes he is &s;orely exerci&s;ed with the Fear that he hath already proved, or &s;hall prove unfaithful, in the Execution of &s;ome important Branch of his Office; that he &s;hall not be able to give any good Account of the weighty Tru&s;t committed to him; that &s;uch Souls &s;hall peri&s;h by his Neglect; and that he &s;hall neither &s;ave him&s;elf, nor them that hear him. Some|times he has unrea&s;onable and wicked Men, Men that have not Faith, Men of Bea&s;t-like Di&s;po&s;itions, to deal with; &s;ome|times
<PB N="13" REF="007454_0015_102D91FC247C58E8">all Men &s;eem to for&s;ake him, and none to &s;tand by him; and what is wor&s;e &s;till, &s;ometimes his Ma&s;ter hides his Face. In a Word, his Di&s;couragements are innumerable, both from without, and from within; &s;o that on this Account al&s;o, he has Need to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s, as a good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And thus I have &s;hewn (as I propo&s;ed) &s;ome of the Difficulties attending the Exerci&s;e of the Mini&s;terial Office, which will require <HI>enduring Hardne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed next to the other General Head; which is,</P>
<P>IIdly, To mention, and a little to in&s;i&s;t on &s;ome of tho&s;e Qualifications which are mainly nece&s;&s;ary, in Order to the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters <HI>enduring Hardne&s;s, as a good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And 1&s;t. It is needful in order to his <HI>enduring Hardne&s;s,</HI> that he be a Man of Faith. Without Faith it is hardly to be &s;up|po&s;ed, that he will <HI>fight the good Fight,</HI> and &s;teadily adhere to his Ma&s;ter's Intere&s;t, in the mid&s;t of Difficulties, &s;o many and great: But if he have &s;ome good Mea&s;ure of this divine Grace, it will have an happy Efficacy in enabling him to face and &s;urmount Difficulties. Faith enables him to ba|lance the Things of Time and Eternity, &s;o as to give each its proper Weight; to put the Sufferings of the pre&s;ent Time in one Scale, and the Glory which is to be revealed in the other; and by this Means, evidently to di&s;cover that the light Afflictions of the pre&s;ent Time, are but as it were for a Mo|ment, and &s;o not worthy to be compared with the Glory that is to be revealed. Faith &s;ometimes enables him to &s;ee his divine Lord &s;tanding by him, and to hear him adre&s;&s;ing him in &s;uch Words as once he did one of his faithful Mini&s;ters, Act. 23.11. <HI>Be of good Cheer</HI> Paul. Faith &s;ometimes opens up the eternal World before him, and gives him &s;uch a View as <HI>Stephen</HI> had, when he &s;aid, <HI>I &s;ee the Heavens opened, and the Son of Man &s;tanding at the right Hand of God,</HI> Act. 7.56. By Faith he hears the Captain of his Salvation &s;aying, as Rev. 3.12. <HI>To him that overcometh, will I give to &s;it down with me on my Throne; even as I al&s;o have overcome, and am &s;et down with my Father on his Throne.</HI> In a Word, Faith &s;o fortifies the Soul, that he is at Times carried in a Manner quite above Di&s;cou|ragement; &s;o that on a Pro&s;pect of the wor&s;t that can happen, he is able to adopt the Language of the Apo&s;tle, Act. 20.22, 23, 24. <HI>And now I go bound in the Spirit to</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>not know|ing the Things that &s;hall befal me there: Save that the Holy Gho&s;t witne&s;&s;eth in every City, &s;aying, That Bonds and Afflictions abide me.
<PB N="14" REF="007454_0016_102D91FE37E17350">But none of the&s;e Things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my &s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my Cour&s;e with Joy, and the Mini&s;try which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Let tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who would <HI>endure Hardne&s;s, as good Sol|diers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> put on the whole Armour of God; above all, let them take the Shield of Faith; let them who have Faith, labour for an Increa&s;e of that divine Grace, let them often pray the Di&s;ciples Prayer, <HI>Lord increa&s;e our Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is needful in order to his <HI>enduring Hardne&s;s,</HI> that he have a hearty Love to Chri&s;t and Souls. Where this Grace is wanting, the Per&s;on will be apt to do his Work grudgingly, and as of Nece&s;&s;ity. Where Love is wanting, there will &s;carcely be any Motive &s;trong enough to engage him to adhere clo&s;ely to his Ma&s;ter's Cau&s;e, when his doing &s;o is attended with peculiar Danger and Difficulty. He'll hardly be con|tented to expo&s;e his Life, or even his E&s;tate, or his Name, for Chri&s;t and his Intere&s;t: On the contrary, his Behaviour will be apt to be like that, Joh. 10.12, 13. <HI>The Hireling fleeth, becau&s;e he is an Hireling, and careth not for the Sheep.</HI> But where this &s;weet Grace of Love is, it has a con&s;training Influence on the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter; it ties him by the Heart to the Service of his glorious Captain, &s;o that he never thinks he can do too much, or enough in his Cau&s;e. Under the powerful Influ|ence of this Grace, he can cheerfully ri&s;que his Life, when his Ma&s;ter's Intere&s;t requires it, with him who &s;aid Act. 21.13. <HI>I am ready not only to be hound, but al&s;o to die for the Name of the Lord Je&s;us.</HI> We &s;ee what a powerful Principle natural Af|fection is in Parents toward their Children, with what Plea&s;ure (under the Influence of it) they go through a World of Fa|tigue and Sufferings to provide for them; &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition do tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, who love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, feel to|wards the Souls of their Flocks: So that the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Paul,</HI> with Re&s;pect to <HI>Timothy,</HI> is applicable to them, that they naturally care for their State, Phil. 2.20. <HI>Naturally, i. e.</HI> As a Parent under the Influence of natural Affection, cares for his Children. A faithful Mini&s;ter, when Love is in Exerci&s;e, does really feel the Bowels of a Parent, and can &s;ay with Re&s;|pect to the Flock of Chri&s;t, as the Apo&s;tle does, Gal. 4.19. <HI>My little Children, of whom I travel in Birth again, 'till Chri&s;t be formed in you.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They &s;hould be Per&s;ons who have made &s;ome con&s;idera|ble Advances in Mortification. This likewi&s;e is a very need|ful
<PB N="15" REF="007454_0017_102D934502CA0510">Qualification for <HI>a good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> If a Mini|&s;ter have an inordinate Love to his carnal Ea&s;e, he'll hardly be willing to follow his Ma&s;ter in a thorny Path, or to en|gage with great Difficulties in the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t: When Tribulation or Per&s;ecution ari&s;es becau&s;e of the Word, by and by he'll be offended. If he love the World with a prevailing Love, it will be apt to take him off from the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t: See a &s;ad In&s;tance, 2 Tim. 4.10. <HI>Demas bath for&s;aken me, hav|ing loved this pre&s;ent World.</HI> Hence that of the Apo&s;tle, 2 Tim. 2.4. <HI>No Man that warreth, intangleth him&s;elf with the Affairs of this Life, that he may plea&s;e him who hath cho&s;en him to be a Soldier.</HI> If he be exce&s;&s;ively fond of worldly Honour and Applau&s;e, he'll hardly be willing to be accounted a Fool, to have his Name ca&s;t out as evil, and to have <HI>all Manner of Evil &s;poken again&s;t him for Chri&s;t's Sake.</HI> Hence that of our Saviour, Joh. 5.44. <HI>How can ye believe, which receive Honour from one another, and &s;eek not the Honour that cometh from God only.</HI></P>
<P>He then who would behave him&s;elf <HI>as a good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;hould be one who has made &s;ome Progre&s;s in the difficult, but nece&s;&s;ary Duty of Self-denial; one who has learned to make Poverty welcome, if it &s;hould fall to his Lot; who knows how to be aba&s;ed, as well as how to abound; one who can deny his Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions, when they become importunate and over-eagar in their Cravings; or as the Apo|&s;tle &s;ays, who keeps under his Body, and brings it into Sub|jection; one who contrary to that Character, Joh. 12.43. <HI>Loves the Prai&s;e of God, more than the Prai&s;e of Men.</HI> In a Word, The <HI>good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is one who has learned to follow his Captain in Honour and Di&s;honour, through good and evil Report; &s;o that he thinks not &s;trange of the fiery Trial, but clo&s;ely adheres to his divine Lord in Time of the greate&s;t Danger and Suffering.</P>
<P N="4">4. Chri&s;tian Courage and Steadine&s;s of Mind, is a Quali|fication much needed in Order to <HI>enduring Hardne&s;s.</HI> I join the&s;e two becau&s;e they are near a-kin, and often where the one is, the other will be found al&s;o. For want of the Grace of Chri&s;tian Courage, even faithful Mini&s;ters are apt &s;ome|times in the evil Day to give Way to &s;inking Dejection of Spirit: They faint in the Day of Adver&s;ity: when Things have a di&s;couraging and threatning-like Appearance, they are ready to give all up for lo&s;t; they can &s;carcely think of any Thing but of leaving their publick Station, and flying into &s;ome hiding Place, where they may have Shelter from the impending
<PB N="16" REF="007454_0018_102D720076583758">Storm. When Courage is wanting, every Difficulty is viewed on the darke&s;t Side. For In&s;tance, a Mini&s;ter &s;ees little or no Appearance of Fruit following his Labours: On the contrary, it &s;eems as tho' Sinners grew daily more &s;ecure and &s;tupid; in this Ca&s;e, he is apt to look on his dealing with Sinners as to no Purpo&s;e, and perhaps is ju&s;t on the Point of re&s;olving that he will make no more mention of the Name of the Lord. Or it may be, he is &s;ituated as <HI>Lot</HI> was in <HI>Sodom,</HI> &s;o that he &s;ees gro&s;s Sins of almo&s;t every Kind abounding, and his righteous Soul is vexed from Day to Day with their unlawful Deeds: In this Ca&s;e he is ready to &s;ay with Jer. 9.2. <HI>Oh that I had in the Wilderne&s;s a lodging Place of wayfaring Men, that I might leave my People and go from them, for they be all Adul|terers, an A&s;&s;embly of treacherous Men,</HI> &amp;c. Or perhaps he be|holds evident Tokens of divine Anger; it &s;eems as if the Lord were about to come forth again&s;t his People with a Sword in&s;tead of a Rod; that the Cloud gathers black and dreadful, and the Enemy is about to break in like a Flood: In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, through defect of Courage, he is ready to think of Nothing &s;o much as of flying from the Storm. But when Chri&s;tian Courage is in Exerci&s;e, it will improve all the&s;e di&s;couraging Appearances, as &s;o many Arguments to di&s;&s;uade from an inglorious Retreat. Chri&s;tian Courage will by no Means admit of Flight in any of the Ca&s;es above|named.</P>
<P>Are Sinners very &s;ecure and &s;tupid, &s;o that nothing that can be &s;aid appears to have any abiding Impre&s;&s;ion on them? Says the good Soldier who has this Grace in Act, "I'll never|thele&s;s continue in the U&s;e of Means with the&s;e &s;tupid Sin|ners, tho' at pre&s;ent they &s;eem to be Hammer-hardned under the Word; he with whom is the Re&s;idue of the Spirit, can &s;end a divine Influence, which will &s;oon and effectually &s;often them; perhaps the Captain of Salvation, who is a King mighty in Battle, may lend me a cho&s;en Shaft from his Quiver, which will reach the Joints and Marrow, &s;o as to rou&s;e them that are at pre&s;ent &s;leeping on the Sides of the Pit, with a dreadful Sound in their Ears: But whatever the Event may be, I'll (thro' Grace) do my Duty, whether the&s;e Sinners will hear, or whether they will forbear; I have Rea&s;on to think that the &s;overeign Will of God concerning them will have Effect by my Mini&s;try, and that I &s;hall be a &s;weet Savour of God in them that peri&s;h, as well as in them that are &s;aved."

<P N="5">5. The good Soldier is one who is acquainted with his Weapons. Being &s;kilful in the Knowledge, and expert in the U&s;e of the Chri&s;tian Armour, is a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification of &s;uch an one as would expect to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s.</HI> That a Soldier &s;hould know his Weapons, every one will grant: Nor is it enough that he be a good Theori&s;t in this Knowledge, but his Know|ledge &s;hould be practical: He &s;hould be capable of handling his Weapons, e&s;pecially he &s;hould be dexterous at the U&s;e of his Sword. Even &s;o every Chri&s;tian Soldier (but e&s;pecially the Officers in Chri&s;t's Camp) &s;hould be acquainted with the Chri&s;tian Armour; particularly, they &s;hould know the U&s;e of the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God; they &s;hould be able to adopt the Experience of him who &s;aid, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.97. <HI>O how love I thy Law; it is my Study all the Day.</HI> They &s;hould love not only to &s;tudy it as a Science, but to feed upon it: And while they receive it in the Love of it, and derive Nouri&s;hment &amp; Delight from it, to &s;ay as P&s;. 119.103. <HI>How &s;weet

<P>Having &s;poken to the two General Heads propo&s;ed in the Doctrinal Part; I pa&s;s on to the <HI>Improvement.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Inference</HI> 1. May Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters lay their Account to <HI>en|dure Hardne&s;s,</HI> or to meet with great Difficulties in their Work? Then it may be inferred, that Per&s;ons &s;hould not be ra&s;h or ha&s;ty in running into the Mini&s;try; it would certainly be wi&s;e in them fir&s;t to count the Co&s;t, and to weigh maturely the Difficulties, as well as the Encouragements which attend the &s;acred Station; to make a clo&s;e Enquiry about what are their Views in engaging in this Office? Whether they have &s;uffici|ent Ground to conclude, that therein they have a &s;ingle Eye? Whether they have tho&s;e Qualifications, by which alone, they &s;hall be enabled to acquit them&s;elves, as Workmen that need not to be a&s;hamed? To think of our Lord's Que&s;tion to <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> Matt. 20.22. <HI>Can ye drink of the Cup that I &s;hall drink; and be baptized with the Bapti&s;m that I am baptized with?</HI> And to examine what An&s;wer they are qualified to give.</P>
<P><HI>Inf.</HI> 2. Are the Difficulties attending the Mini&s;terial Office &s;o many and great? Then People &s;hould take Heed that they do not by any Part of their Conduct, render them greater. It would be cruel to add a Load to a heavy Burden: People may do this many Ways; as when they appear di&s;pos'd to watch for Mini&s;ters halting, to expo&s;e their human Frailties; repre&s;enting every le&s;&s;er Infirmity in the blacke&s;t Colour, as though it were the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Crime; when they expect that a Mini&s;ter &s;hould perform the whole of his vocational Labours with the utmo&s;t Exactne&s;s, and yet do not afford him a com|petent temporal Support; like the cruel <HI>Egyptian</HI> Ta&s;k-Ma&s;ters, who would allow no Straw, and yet demanded the full Tale of Brick; or when they won't endure &s;ound Doctrine and
<PB N="19" REF="007454_0021_102D7205EFA0A080">mini&s;terial Faithfulne&s;s, but count him an Enemy who tells them the Truth; but e&s;pecially, when they give a deaf Ear to the great Command of God in the Go&s;pel, to believe on the Name of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o leave Mini&s;ters la|menting their Want of Succe&s;s with heavy Hearts, &s;aying, <HI>Who hath believed our Report? And to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</HI> People would do well to con&s;ider that faithful Mini&s;ters are the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t; and that he'll re&s;ent the Neglect, and practical Contempt, or the ill Treatment of and Kind, that they meet with; that he who de&s;pi&s;eth them, de&s;|pi&s;eth not only Man but God. Beloved, Mini&s;ters are engaged in difficult Po&s;ts, and they much need your Sympathy and Pray|ers, and friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance: If you knew how hardly be&s;tead they often are, while without are Fighting, and within are Fears; you would &s;urely pity them, and do all you could to lighten their Burden.</P>
<P>Omitting other U&s;es which the Subject might afford, I proceed to the la&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> The U&s;e of Exhortation: In which, I &s;hall addre&s;s my &s;elf (1.) to Mini&s;ters. (2.) To Candidates for the Mini&s;try. (3.) To the Candidate now to be &s;et apart.</P>
<P>And 1&s;t. To You, <HI>My Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the Mini&s;try;</HI> Permit me to &s;ay, That God who has cho&s;en us from among our Brethren, to come near to him, and to mini|&s;ter in Things Sacred, has in &s;o doing, highly honour'd us. We are engaged in a Calling, which tho' mean and de&s;picable in the Eye of a carnal World, yet would be no Di&s;grace, but an Honour to Angels, to be employ'd in. To be workers to|gether with God in that Building of Mercy, the Plan of which was projected in the Depth of infinite Wi&s;dom, from the Morning of Eternity: to be employed in the Quality of Amba&s;&s;adors, to negociate between the King of Kings, and immortal Souls, about Matters of the greate&s;t Moment: What higher Honour! And as ours is a Station of high Honour, &s;o of high Tru&s;t and Importance; the great Head of the Church has intru&s;ted us with Souls which are his choice&s;t Jewels, and on whom he &s;et &s;o high a Value, as to &s;hed his precious Blood for them: He puts &s;uch Confidence in us, as to employ us in the Quality of Officers, to head his Soldiers in the War again&s;t Earth and Hell. Let us think of the Honour, and be humble; and let us think of the Tru&s;t, and be faithful: Let us remember that all is Grace, that we have nothing but what we have received, that one main Rea&s;on why we are thus highly honour'd, is, that by our Meanne&s;s God might take Occa&s;ion the more
<PB N="20" REF="007454_0022_102D724CC89D1BD0">illu&s;triou&s;ly to di&s;play the Glory of his Grace; That he has put his Trea&s;ure in earthen Ve&s;&s;els, that it might the more evidently appear, that the Excellency of the Power is of God, and not of Man. Let us beware of any Action which looks like betraying our Tru&s;t; on the contrary, let us be faithful to God and Souls; let us labour daily in the U&s;e of Means, for an Increa&s;e of Faith, for more Love to God and Souls, more Mortification and Self-denial, more Chri&s;tian Courage and Steadine&s;s of Mind, more Skilfulne&s;s in the Knowledge and Expertne&s;s in the U&s;e of our &s;piritual Weapons: In a Word, more of all tho&s;e Qualifications whereby we &s;hall be fitted to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s, as good Soldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And whatever mini&s;terial Qualifications it has plea&s;ed the Giver of every good Gift, and perfect, to be&s;tow on us, let us not bury them in the Earth, nor hide them in the unprofitable Napkin: On the contrary, let us &s;tir up the Gifts that are in us; being in&s;tant in Sea&s;on, and out of Sea&s;on; not thinking much of our hard Study or Toil, or bodily Fatigue and Expence of Spirits, if &s;o be, that thereby we may do any Service; not counting even our Lives dear, &s;o that we may fini&s;h our Cour&s;e with Joy, and the Mini&s;try committed to us of the Lord Je&s;us. Let us remember that there will be Time enough to re&s;t in Heaven, and hence, let us be willing now to labour; and let us not only be willing to work our &s;elves, but let us do what we can to encourage others in their Work: Let all Chri&s;t's faithful Mini&s;ters endeavour to &s;trengthen one another's Hands.</P>
<P>If the Soldiers, but e&s;pecially the Officers in Chri&s;t's Army, begin to turn their Swords again&s;t one another, they are like to be an ea&s;y Prey to the common Enemy. O that this were duly laid to Heart! It would powerfully Influence us to cul|tivate that &s;trict Unity, which (through the divine Ble&s;&s;ing) would greatly &s;trengthen the common Cau&s;e, which would render us fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun, terrible as an Army with Banners.</P>
<P>And to animate us to exert our &s;elves to the utmo&s;t in our Ma&s;ter's Cau&s;e; let us con&s;ider that our Charge is weighty; our Account will be &s;olemn; and that the Time when we mu&s;t make it up, is fa&s;t approaching. Let us with the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> remember <HI>that we mu&s;t &s;hortly put off this our Tabernacle.</HI> Some of us, (it's likely) have almo&s;t done; a few Years, or it may be Months, and the pre&s;ent Scene with Re&s;pect to us, will for ever &s;hut. O then, let us do &s;peedily and with our Might, whatever our Hands find to do: Let
<PB N="21" REF="007454_0023_102D72620BFC3108">us crowd in as much Service as we can, in the few remaining Days we have yet left. And to keep up our Spirits under the Coldne&s;s and Ingratitude of the World, the Contradiction and Oppo&s;ition of unrea&s;onable Men, all our Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s in our Work, all the Temptations that ari&s;e from Satan and our own Hearts; In a Word, all the Difficulties of the Campaign; let us look forward by Faith to that happy approaching Day, <HI>when Chri&s;t who is our Life &s;hall appear, and we al&s;o &s;hall appear with him in Glory; when they that be wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the Bright|ne&s;s of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To Candidates: I would &s;ay, <HI>My dear Brethren,</HI> we who have been acting our Part as Officers in Chri&s;t's Camp, mu&s;t &s;oon move off the Stage: The&s;e Mouths that now &s;peak to you, mu&s;t in a &s;hort Time be &s;top'd with the Du&s;t of Death; and we have our Eyes on you to &s;ucceed us. 'Tis you, and &s;uch as you, that mu&s;t fill up our vacant Places, in the Camp of the Saints. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, for &s;ome agreeable Pro&s;pect of a Succe&s;&s;ion! Be exhorted, <HI>Brethren,</HI> to labour for tho&s;e Qualifications by which you may be fitted to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s, as good Soldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> and in order hereto, give your &s;elves to Reading, to clo&s;e Study, and to Prayer; and let all your Endeavours be u&s;ed in Sub&s;erviency to the promi&s;ed Aids of the divine Spirit. Beware of a proud, &s;elf-&s;ufficient Di&s;po|&s;ition: Remember that a &s;criptural Bi&s;hop mu&s;t not be a Novice, le&s;t being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Con|demnation of the Devil: Don't e&s;teem your &s;elves to be already well enough qualified for the great Work of the Go&s;pel-Mi|ni&s;try; but on the contrary, endeavour to maintain a low Opinion of any Attainments you have already arrived at; and forgetting the Things that are behind, be pre&s;&s;ing forward. Let it be your daily Labour, to add to the Fund of Know|ledge, either by getting &s;ome new Ideas, or tho&s;e you have, better dige&s;ted: And let the governing Principle in all your Endeavours, be love to God, and Concern for his Glory.</P>
<P N="3">3. I'd addre&s;s my &s;elf to the Candidate now to be &s;olemnly &s;et apart to the Work of the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>You are now, <HI>Sir,</HI> about to engage in a Station of great Importance, and great Difficulty: You are to have the preach|ing of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, and the admini&s;tring the Seal of the New-Covenant committed to your Tru&s;t: You are to have the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven put into your Hand,
<PB N="22" REF="007454_0024_102D91FFF37C4088">with Authority mini&s;terially to open and &s;hut, in the Name of him who openeth, and no man &s;hutteth, and who &s;hutteth, and no Man openeth: You are about to take the Charge of a Number of immortal Souls, each of which is of more Value than a World; on this Condition, that if any &s;hould peri&s;h by your Neglect, it is to be requir'd at your Hand. I tru&s;t you have known the&s;e many Years, what it is to be a Soldier of Chri&s;t, which is a Character that belongs to every Chri&s;tian; and that you are not now to begin the War with the Devil, the Fle&s;h and the World: But that you are this Day, in &s;omewhat of a peculiar Sen&s;e, taking up Arms again&s;t Satan and his Kingdom, <HI>viz.</HI> as an Officer in Chri&s;t's Camp. And you may rea&s;onably expect to have the Power and Policy of Earth and Hell engaged again&s;t you. You are engaging in the mini&s;terial Work, in an evil Day, a Day of Trouble and of Rebuke, and of Bla&s;phemy; a Day when Religion appears to be low, and the Enemies of Chri&s;t and his Cau&s;e are apparently prevailing; when a Spirit of Conviction &s;eems to be much withheld, and the Waters of the Sanctuary to have lo&s;t (in a great Mea&s;ure) their healing Virtue; &s;o that the Ways of <HI>Zion</HI> mourn, and faithful Mini&s;ters with heavy Hearts complain, that they have laboured in vain, and &s;pent their Strength for nought: A Day, when many real Chri&s;ti|ans appear in a &s;ad Degree, to have lo&s;t the lively affecting Views of divine Things; when a worldly Spirit prevails, &s;o that there's too much Rea&s;on for the Apo&s;tle's Complaint, That all Men mind their own Things, and none the Things that are Chri&s;t's: when In&s;tances of awful Impenitency and Hardne&s;s of Heart abound; when Sinners &s;in with a high Hand, make light of their Danger, mocking at Fear, and laughing at the &s;haking of God's Spear. In a Word, the Charge is weighty, and the Days are evil; and to undertake &s;uch a Charge, at &s;uch a Time, is enough to make a frail Mortal tremble.</P>
<P>And I make no doubt, <HI>My Brother,</HI> but your Spirits are weighted with it, and have been &s;o before this Day; that you have been carefully counting the Co&s;t, and revolving the Difficulties in your Mind. I mention the&s;e Difficulties not to di&s;courage you, but on the contrary, to animate you to ap|ply to your Work with the greater Vigour and Re&s;olution: And for your Encouragement, I &s;hall propo&s;e a few animating Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="23" REF="007454_0025_102D92024B3867F0">
1. Con&s;ider that though it is a very difficult, yet it is withal, a very honourable Work you are engaged in. In the Time of the flouri&s;hing of the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-Wealth, it was thought a high Honour to fight under their Banner: But you have the Honour of being enli&s;ted this Day, and this, in a Place of &s;ome con&s;iderable Di&s;tinction too, under the Banner of him who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, who e&s;teems of the Monarchs of the Earth, as Gra&s;shoppers. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> e&s;teem'd this Honour, an high Favour conferred on him, when he &s;aid, Eph. 3.8. <HI>To me who am le&s;s then the lea&s;t of all Saints, is this Grace given; that I &s;hould preach among the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>the un&s;earchable Riches of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider that you are to have your Ma&s;ter's Pre|&s;ence with you in the whole of your Mini&s;terial Work. It's true, the Work is great and difficult, and you may ap|prehend your &s;elf weak and very unequal to it: But remem|ber you have a &s;trong Lord to depend upon; and that as the Work you have to be employ'd in, is his Work, on him therefore you may with a humble Confidence depend, for all that A&s;&s;i&s;tance you have need of; for who goeth a Warfare at any Time at his own Charges? He can give you the Wi&s;dom of the Serpent, as well as the Simplicity of the Dove; whereby you &s;hall be able to countermine and baffle the mo&s;t in&s;iduous Plots of the Devil and his In&s;truments, though they &s;hould work like Moles under Ground, and dig deep as Hell to accompli&s;h their De&s;igns. He can furni&s;h you with a brave, heroick, undaunted Spirit; whereby you &s;hall be enabled to &s;et your Face like a Flint, and with a calm intrepid Cou|rage, to face the mo&s;t formidable A&s;&s;aults of the Enemy. He can make you a fenced brazen Wall, again&s;t which, though your Enemies &s;hould fight, yet they &s;hall not be able to pre|vail. He can temper your Zeal and Courage with Humility and Prudence, and Self-denial: In a Word, he can give you the Chri&s;tian Temper in all its lovely Branches; &s;o that you &s;hall be able to contend for the Faith of Chri&s;t, with the Spirit of Chri&s;t. Did I &s;ay he can? I may add, he will, if you look on him by Faith, or depend aright upon him; for he has &s;aid, <HI>My Grace is &s;ufficient for thee,</HI> 2 Cor. 12.9. This Promi&s;e belongs to every faithful Mini&s;ter to the End, as well as to him to whom it was fir&s;t made.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider that if you be faithful to your Colours, you are &s;ure of the Victory. What Soldier would not fight with
<PB N="24" REF="007454_0026_102D920521C93B20">Courage, who is &s;ure of a compleat Victory at la&s;t? But this is the Ca&s;e of the <HI>good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> It mu&s;t be &s;o, for he has Omnipotence on his Side; the Captain of his Salvation, is a King mighty in Battle, he will tread his Ene|mies in his Anger, and trample them in his Fury; their Blood &s;hall be on his Garments, and he will &s;tain all his Raiment.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t formidable Party they can po&s;&s;ibly make, is but as Briars and Thorns, before devouring Flames: If then he erect his Banner in the Name of Chri&s;t, he &s;hall do valiantly; if he be &s;trong in the Grace which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, he &s;hall both do great Things, and &s;hall &s;till prevail.</P>
<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider that there is a glorious Reward con&s;equent upon mini&s;terial Faithfulne&s;s. It's true, I cannot propo&s;e any great earthly Reward for your Encouragement: on the contrary, many faithful Mini&s;ters have been obliged to endure Hard|ne&s;s, in this as well as in other Re&s;pects, to content them&s;elves with mean Fare, and &s;ome have been pinched for want of pure Nece&s;&s;aries. And altho' Mini&s;ters &s;hould have a Com|petency, God having ordained, that they who preach the Go&s;pel &s;hould live by the Go&s;pel; yet it would be unrea&s;o|nable for them to expect to live in the Pomp and Splendor of temporal Princes, &s;eeing their Lord has told them, <HI>That his Kingdom is not of this World.</HI> But con&s;ider, that altho' you have no great &s;ecular Inducement, yet you have a Re|ward of a higher Nature than the Crowns of Princes, and the peculiar Trea&s;ure of Kings and Provinces, <HI>viz. A Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</HI> Think my Brother of that Day which is approaching, when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear, and you &s;hall appear with him in Glory; when you &s;hall have a Number of &s;aved, glorified Souls, all &s;hining in the Beauties of Holine&s;s, like &s;o many radiant Gems to adorn your Crown of Glory. O think of that happy approaching Day! <HI>when they that are wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the Brightne&s;s of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI> Or though it &s;hould be your hard Lot to labour all your Days in vain, and &s;pend your Strength for nought, and never to be in&s;trumental of turning any to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, (which I cannot think your Ma&s;ter will &s;uffer to be the Ca&s;e); Yet even in this Ca&s;e, remember that your Judgment is with the Lord, and your Work with your God; and that your faithful Endeavours will be well accepted.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="25" REF="007454_0027_102D9206CC92B448">
5. Con&s;ider that the more you do in your Station, and the more Hardne&s;s you are called to &s;uffer in the Cau&s;e of your glorious Captain; it is likely the more you'll enjoy of his gracious &s;piritual Pre&s;ence. When the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was called before <HI>Nero,</HI> no Man &s;tood with him, but all Men for&s;ook him; yet he tell us, <HI>that then the Lord &s;tood by him, and &s;trengthened him, &s;o that he was delivered out of the Mouth of the Lion,</HI> 2 Tim. 4.16, 17. It was when the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> was bani&s;hed into the ob&s;cure remote I&s;le of <HI>Patmos,</HI> for the Word of God, and for the Te&s;timony which he held, that he was favoured with tho&s;e glorious Vi&s;ions and Revelations, which you have on Record in the la&s;t Book of the New-Te&s;tament. If your Lord call you to great Trials, you &s;hall have proportional Incomes of Grace; you &s;hall be able to adopt the Experience of the Apo&s;tle, and his Fellow-Soldiers, 2 Cor. 1.5. <HI>As the Sufferings of Chri&s;t abound in us, &s;o our Con&s;olation al&s;o aboundeth by Chri&s;t:</HI> So that you'll be qualified from what you feel, to unriddle the&s;e Paradoxes, 2 Cor. 6.9, 10. <HI>As dying, and behold we live; as cha&s;tned, and not killed; as &s;orrowful, yet always re|joicing; as having nothing, and yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all Things.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e, <HI>Sir,</HI> are animating Con&s;iderations: under the In|fluence of them addre&s;s your &s;elf to your Work, with a cheerful Courage and Vigour. Take Heed to your Mini&s;try, that you fulfil it: Take Heed to your Self, and to your Doctrine; for in doing this, you will both &s;ave your &s;elf, and them that hear you.</P>
<P>I &s;hould next addre&s;s my &s;elf to the <HI>People,</HI> who are about to receive the Candidate for their Mini&s;ter, were they pre&s;ent. They had appointed &s;ome of their Number to act in their Name, on the &s;olemn Occa&s;ion; but it plea&s;ed that wi&s;e Sovereign, who does every Thing for the be&s;t, to prevent their coming. However, altho' not per&s;onally pre&s;ent, we have their Concurrence in the Matter. Had they been here, I &s;hould have &s;aid to them; That after a &s;ufficient Time for Trial, they had proceeded to give a Call to this our Brother; and that &s;aid Call had been proceeded in with as much Order as their Situation and other Circum&s;tances would admit of: that we rejoice with them, in that after a Series of Events, in which they have been liable to a Variety of Difficulties, and in which many Changes have pa&s;&s;ed over them; that a bountiful Lord is at Length about to be&s;tow on them a Mi|ni&s;ter, who we believe has obtained Help of God to be faith|ful; and who we tru&s;t will be enabled to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s as</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="007454_0028_102D9208FA8BDE88"><HI>a good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> That as they had been hearing that he is engaging in a difficult Wurk, &s;o we hope that they will not by any Part of their Conduct, wilfully add to his Difficulties: On the contrary, that they would yield him that limited Subjection and Obedience in the Lord, which they had &s;olemnly promi&s;ed in their Call; regarding and obeying him as having the Rule over them, and who watches for their Souls as one who mu&s;t give an Account: That they would remember who&s;e Name he comes in, and who&s;e Me&s;|&s;age he is charged with; and would e&s;teem him very highly in Love for his Ma&s;ter's Sake, and for his Work's Sake; e&s;pecially, that they would receive that Chri&s;t and Salvation he offers to them, as they would not oblige him to appear as a &s;wift Witne&s;s again&s;t them at the great Day of Accompts: That they would be tender as to the expo&s;ing any Frailties they may &s;ee in their Mini&s;ter; e&s;pecially &s;uch Things as they have Rea&s;on to think are no more then Indi&s;cretions, proceeding from meer Inadvertency, without any criminal Intention; that they would kindly draw the Veil of Charity over &s;uch Things: That they would wre&s;tle with God in Prayer on his Behalf, that he may be in every Re&s;pect an able and &s;ucce&s;sful Mini&s;ter of the New-Te&s;tament. And finally, that as he mini&s;ters to them in Spirituals, that they would do to their utmo&s;t, cheerfully and liberally to mini&s;ter to him in Temporals.</P>
<P>May the Lord make Mini&s;ters and People mutual Ble&s;&s;ings to one another; that &s;o the happy Day may come, when both he that &s;oweth, and they that reap, may rejoice together.</P>
