<OPENER><SALUTE>Very dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have I perceive, &s;u&s;tain'd the Lo&s;s of a dear Creature-Comfort, your little Daughter. I rejoyce to hear that the Lord hath not only &s;upported you un|der this Affliction, but given his Ble&s;&s;ing with it to your dear Soul. Hath not the Lord, dear <HI>Jonathan,</HI> much more than made up the Lo&s;s by Him&s;elf; while the Stream failing, he hath <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ted your Soul, and filled it up to the Brim at the Fountain-Head, with others of his dear Children, of whom he hath graciou&s;ly and gloriou&s;ly increa&s;ed the Number among you of Late,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was, the Spring before the Date of this Letter, a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Revival of Religion at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> wherein there <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> You or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hopefully converted.</NOTE> as I under&s;tand by your kind Letter.</P>

great and worthy Name of our Immanuel! Well! Glory to free pure Grace: The Wil|derne&s;s is become a fruitful Field, and made to blo&s;&s;om as the Ro&s;e: <HI>The Ro&s;e of Sharon</HI> ap|pears in tran&s;cendent Glory. Lo! now the Winter is pa&s;t, the Rain is over and gone, the Flowers of Grace appear, the <HI>Time of the &s;inging of Birds,</HI> young Converts, &s;weet Birds of Para|di&s;e is come, and there they are chirping forth the Prai&s;es of the Lamb on the Boughs of free Grace; <HI>and the Voice of the Turtle,</HI> the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit is heard in your, as well as in our Land: This is the more refre&s;hing to me, as the dear Lord him&s;elf drew out my Soul much, (I be|lieve for more than a Month) the latter End of la&s;t Winter, and beginning of the Spring, that he would give you, my dear Brother, much A&s;i&s;tance, Comfort, and Succe&s;s &amp;c. as I wrote to you in a Letter about that Time. Oh! He is a Prayer-hearing, a Wonder-working God! He makes his Name appear glorious and excellent indeed! <HI>Glory to God the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>The Letter that comes inclos'd to you, be|loved <HI>Barber,</HI> from our dear Brother <HI>T</HI>&mdash; was peru&s;ed by me when it came to Hand; that I might find out what remained for me to

write, and I am glad he has given you &s;ome Hints of what has pa&s;s'd, and &s;omewhat par|ticularly: But a full Narration mu&s;t be left un|told till we &s;ee one another here below, or meet in the Upper-Hou&s;e; ju&s;t as our Father plea&s;es: But if it be his holy Will, I &s;hould indeed be glad, my dear Brother, yea very glad to &s;ee you again while we are in this World. Oh my dear Brother! When will you come over to your longing and loving Brother <HI>Daven|port,</HI> and others that are dear to you? The Lord give me to wait, and you to come in his Time.</P>
<P>But to return, I would add to what Brother <HI>T</HI>&mdash;has written on the awful Affair of Books and Cloaths at <HI>New-London,</HI> which affords Grounds of deep and la&s;ting Humiliation. I was, to my Shame be it &s;poken, the Rignlead|er in that horrid Action. I was, my dear Bro|ther, under the powerful Influence of the fal&s;e Spirit, almo&s;t one whole Day together, and Part of &s;everal Days. The Lord &s;hewed me after|wards that the Spirit I was then acted by, was in its Operations void of true inward Peace, prompting me to lay the greate&s;t Stre&s;s on Ex|ternals, to neglect the Heart, to be full of Im|datience, Pride, and Arrogance: Although I
<PB N="4" REF="005373_0003_101827F8617E6EB0">
thought in the Time of it that 'twas the Spi|rit of God in a high Degree, (awful indeed!) My Body, e&s;pecially my Leg Were much di&s;or|dered at the &s;ame Time, which Satan and my e|vil Heart might make &s;ome Handle of. When the Lord &s;hewed me and my Brethren <HI>T.</HI>&mdash; and <HI>S</HI>&mdash;our Sin, he di&s;po&s;ed us to a free and full Confe&s;&s;ion. Pre&s;ently upon it a Light &s;hone into my Soul, di&s;covering the Wi&s;dom of God in leaving us, and me particularly to fall; that however Shame belonged to me, yet Glory to him for his Wi&s;dom e&s;pecially; but this Light I &s;oon &s;hut my Eyes again&s;t, be|cau&s;e it was &s;weet, I could not bear it. I thought, having committed &s;o grievous a Sin, I mu&s;t have much more Bitter, before I had any Sweet. Thus I tried to be humbled, crying in my Soul for more Weight, &s;eeking after a legal Repentance; and thus I continued from &s;ome Part of the Forenoon, till near Night. Although this &s;weet and plea&s;ant Light was offered to my Soul almo&s;t or quite all the Time; but I dur&s;t not admit it for the Rea|&s;on afore&s;aid: Yet at la&s;t it increa&s;ed to that degree, and became &s;o powerful that I could with&s;tand no longer, I was con&s;trained to prai&s;e the Lord, e&s;pecially for his Wi&s;dom, in
<PB N="5" REF="005373_0003_101827F8617E6EB0">
leaving me to fall as I did. At the &s;ame Time my Sin in falling appear'd ne'er the le&s;s, but indeed more odious and Abominable; but &s;till I mu&s;t prai&s;e the Lord, while I condemn'd and loath'd my &s;elf. The dear and merciful Lord took from me a legal Spirit of Heavine&s;s and gave me a Garment of Prai&s;e; and I found Go&s;pel Repentance to be quite another Thing than I imagined in my legal Frame, viz. to take Part with the Lord fully again&s;t my &s;elf. He gave me truly to loath what I had done, and my &s;elf for it; and he made me willing if it was his Plea&s;ure, and for his Glory to be &s;toned by the whole World together, not to make Attonement, but in Te&s;timony again&s;t, and Abhorrence of the Sin; yet &s;till I mu&s;t prai&s;e the Lord if I went thro' Hell to him, I mu&s;t prai&s;e, I could not bear to refrain from that one Minute. I believe mo&s;t of God's dear Children around could not receive it, that I &s;hould enjoy the Lord &s;o &s;oon after &s;o awful a Fall. However the Lord purified my Com|forts in this Way, and I could not wonder at them, having been my &s;elf ju&s;t before in the &s;ame legal Frame and Track. Quickly after one told me, he believed I had confe&s;s'd that to be the fal&s;e Spirit that was the true, I gave
<PB N="6" REF="005373_0004_101827FA1BC1FCD0">
heed to him, and pre&s;ently began to murmur again&s;t the Lord, and felt about a Quarter of an Hour, as if I was &s;inking into the Belly of Hell; but the Lord in great Love came a|gain and brought to my Soul a &s;weet and pow|erful Sen&s;e of his Wi&s;dom in leaving me to fall; that I might thus be purged of idolizing my &s;elf, others of God's Children purged of idolizing me, Hypocrites al&s;o di&s;covered, yea, and the Elect converted; while others are hardened in righteous Judgment, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus was my poor ill de&s;erving Soul in Free Grace refre&s;h'd for a Day together, and &s;ometimes even fea&s;ted. The next Day I felt &s;till, but had not &s;o much Sweetne&s;s, but the Day after, the Wi&s;dom, Power, Love and Faith|fulne&s;s of God &s;hone in clearly and warmly to|gether on my Soul from Morning to Night. In the Afternoon in tho&s;e Words, <HI>He doeth all Things well!</HI> Thus was my Soul fed, yea &s;ometimes filled with Comfort, while my dear Brethren that fell with, or rather after me, who had not been near &s;o guilty as I, were fill|ed with racking Di&s;tre&s;s, Darkne&s;s and Temp|tations. Oh my Brother! This was &s;overeign Grace indeed! By this Time my complicated Di&s;ea&s;e was come near to a Cri&s;is: For I had
<PB N="7" REF="005373_0004_101827FA1BC1FCD0">
the long Fever on me, and the Cancry Hu|mour broken out in one Leg, raw and &s;wol'n round and over it from my Knee to my Foot at the &s;ame Time, and running Friday Night and after, near the Middle of <HI>March,</HI> I believe I may &s;ay Quarts in &s;ome Hours; and now for a Day together I expected nothing but to die, and that &s;oon; all about me expected the &s;ame. But Oh! my dear Brother, I can't tell you in Words, how refre&s;hing this was to my Soul; although I concluded it would be look'd upon by the World, and even by mo&s;t Chri&s;|tians as an immediate Judgment of Heaven, and that &s;o I &s;hould die in their Eyes as a Hypocrite and Malefactor: Yet, ble&s;&s;ed be God, I think this did not at all damp, but &s;weetly purify my Joy, my Evidences for Heaven, thro' pure rich Grace, were then clear without Doubt, and a &s;ecret inexpre&s;&s;ible Thir&s;t for Eternity given and continued to my unwor|thy Soul mo&s;t of the Time with much Com|po&s;ure, &s;ometimes with Rapture. Oh! my beloved Brother, you mu&s;t think, for I can't tell you how I felt, when I thought thus; Oh! am I indeed within a few Days, or a few Hours of Eternity, ble&s;&s;ed Eternity! What &s;o near the End of my Cour&s;e here? And e&s;pecially,
<PB N="8" REF="005373_0005_101827FD1574E798">
am I &s;o near the End of all Sin, that which my Soul could not bear, and longed to be freed from above any Thing el&s;e! Difficulties and Troubles &s;eem'd as nothing in compari&s;on of it! Oh! am I &s;o near pure and perfect Glory above! Oh I &s;hall then be like my glo|rious God, and dear Redeemer? <HI>For I &s;hall &s;ee him as he is,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I &s;hall &s;in no more, no more for ever,</HI> &amp;c. Here let your Soul Fire in Me|ditation and joyn with me in Prai&s;e to the ble&s;|&s;ed Father, Son and Spirit, <HI>Amen!</HI> Once in|deed I was thought by &s;ome to be actually dy|ing, when I was ju&s;t a fainting. I did not think I was going then, but I hop'd in a few more &s;uch Turns that I &s;hould take a clear Flight to the Realms of Glory. It &s;eem'd to be a Foreta&s;te of Death, and I had pre&s;ently a Fore|ta&s;te of Glory, which the Children of God en|ter into in a Moment, when they leave their Bodies and this World. Oh! What heavenly Light and ravi&s;hing Joys broke in then upon my Soul! <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>But the Lord was plea&s;ed to order me to re|turn, and tho' it was truly hard, the Lord ena|bled me to &s;ay, <HI>Thy Will be done.</HI> I &s;eem'd in|deed to tho&s;e about me, as one ri&s;ing from the Dead, particularly to Brother <HI>S</HI>&mdash;and <HI>T</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="9" REF="005373_0005_101827FD1574E798">
and the Lord comforted my Soul with a fre&s;h Sen&s;e of that Word in <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.12. <HI>Therefore &s;prang there even of one, and him as good as dead,</HI> &amp;c. Al&s;o the Lord &s;et home that Word powerfully, and cau&s;ed a feeling Sen&s;e of it to continue near a Month together; <HI>Go tell the Di&s;ciples and</HI> Peter <HI>that he goeth before you in|to Galilee.</HI> As if the Lord had &s;aid him&s;elf, Go, tell my Di&s;ciples that have for&s;aken me, and <HI>Peter</HI> that has denied me in a mo&s;t awful Manner, tell them, &amp;c. Tell <HI>Peter</HI> the guiltie&s;t of all, the vile&s;t of all, comfort his drooping Soul, let him be di&s;tingui&s;hed by Grace, free &s;ove|reign Grace, tho' he has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by Sin; call him by Name, tell him <HI>I go before him into Galilee</HI> with my comfortable and &s;uc|ce&s;sful Pre&s;ence, let him &s;tand up in the Day of Penteco&s;t, and &s;peak, let my Power go forth and Three Thou&s;and be converted &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus was my poor Soul refre&s;hed and &s;a|tisfied, that the dear Je&s;us would further com|fort and improve me, <HI>would go before me, &amp;c.</HI> Oh! My Brother, never did I behold &s;o clear|ly and &s;o &s;en&s;ibly apprehend the Lord's &s;ove|reign Grace with re&s;pect to his Children, the mo&s;t back-&s;liding of them, as at this Time I am &s;peaking of; and then for near a Month,
<PB N="10" REF="005373_0006_101827FEA7305558">
and at &s;ometimes &s;ince, <HI>Glory to God alone.</HI> The Lord Je&s;us was al&s;o plea&s;ed to give a fixed, &s;ollid and &s;en&s;ible Union to his Children where ever they were, and what ever their Frames might be, or their Thoughts or Treatment of me, be it ever &s;o wrong (they then being to be pitied) I &s;ay, Union to them as and becau&s;e they were Fellow Members of the &s;ame Body of Je&s;us, more purely I think, than ever be|fore: And ble&s;&s;ed be God, this was a great Support and Comfort to me in the uncom|mon Trials I met with from the Children of God at that Time. Say of me, or do with me what they would, &s;till I mu&s;t love them dearly, inexpre&s;&s;ibly; and if they pull'd from me, they &s;eem'd to pull the Heart-Strings of Love the tighter; my very Soul thro' Grace lov'd them and pitied them, and tho&s;e dear Chri&s;tians, that &s;pake and acted mo&s;t again&s;t me, I think I may &s;ay thro, rich Grace, were made as dear, if not dearer to my Soul than any, <HI>Glory to God!</HI> Had it not been &s;o, my Trials then would have been exceeding cutting. Thus the Lord &s;tood by me, and &s;trengthen|ed me, and comforted me a vile Mortal: Ble&s;&s;ed be his Name forevermore, who &s;o wonderfully di&s;play'd his Covenant-Love and
<PB N="11" REF="005373_0006_101827FEA7305558">
Faithfulne&s;s, even to the mo&s;t back&s;liding of his Children.</P>
<P>Oh! My dearly beloved Brother, the Lord give you to take Warning by this terrible Fall and give you <HI>to watch and pray that you enter not into Temptation.</HI> Oh be humble thro Grace, and be not proud of the Gifts and Graces, the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Succe&s;s the Lord has given or may give you, take no Part of the Glory to your &s;elf, neither lean to your own Under&s;tanding. Oh! be not wi&s;e above what is written, nor ever leave the &s;acred unerring Oracles of Truth. The dear Lord &s;ave you from Extremes on both Sides the Path of Duty, and continue his Pre&s;ence, yea fill you &s;till more with his Spirit, and give you Grace for Grace. Grace, <HI>That you may rightly improve, and not &s;adly abu&s;e, the Grace that he gives,</HI> &amp;c. The Lord ble&s;s you my dear Brother, and ble&s;s the&s;e mournful and yet joyful Lines to you and to any other that may hear them. Do write to me as &s;oon and as often as you can, or rather let me &s;ee you Face to Face, that we may &s;peak about Je&s;us together, and I tru&s;t he will come in the Mid&s;t and &s;ay, <HI>Peace unto you.</HI>&mdash; I can't but hope, if my dear Brother <HI>White|field</HI> return, and it be the Lord's Will, I may

<P>The&s;e Lines come fill'd with Love to you, and the dear Children of God with you. Tell tho&s;e poor Orphans and others that are uncon|verted, I long for them to come to Chri&s;t without Delay: For, <HI>If they don't come to Chri&s;t and believe on him, they mu&s;t be damned and burnt in Hell for ever.</HI> Mat. 16.16. John 3.16. Dreadful indeed! Oh! Je&s;us offers Mer|cy freely, (<HI>John</HI> 7.37.) and can they bear to &s;tay behind in this glorious Time, when others thro' Grace are flocking to Chri&s;t, and longing for them. (<HI>Luke</HI> 7.41, 32.) You may improve upon this with them, as the Lord may enable you.</P>
<P>The good Lord ble&s;s it to their dear preci|ous Souls! When Brother <HI>Whitefield</HI> returns, give much <HI>Love</HI> to him, and de&s;ire him to pray, yea joyn with him in praying for Your poor fallen Brother, yet mercifully treated in our dear and ble&s;&s;ed IMMA|NUEL.</P>

<P>JOYN with me in giving Golory to the Name of our GOD, for what he has been doing among us at <HI>Bethe&s;da</HI> of late, as well as formerly. Surely your Heart mu&s;t leap for Joy, when you hear what the Lord has done for us, and that he made u&s;e of you as an In&s;trument. Indeed, we have had a Spring of new, and very wonderful Delights. This de&s;art Land is made to rejoyce and blo&s;&s;om like a Ro&s;e. We have &s;een &s;omewhat of the Glo|ry of the Lord and the Excellency of our God. He is indeed excellent in Working. Oh! that I could &s;uitably admire and &s;et forth his Work unto you. When you read, you mu&s;t think what you have &s;een in Time pa&s;t, and may the Lord give you a lively and refre&s;hing Sen&s;e thereof. For &s;ome Months pa&s;t there has been &s;ome Stir among the dry Bones in this

Valley.&mdash;Several were awakened and made to cry earne&s;tly after the Lord. And about a Month ago, one of our Labourers was hope|fully converted, a Man of about forty Years of Age.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Day of la&s;t Month, I receiv'd Yours from <HI>Maidenhead</HI> of the 30th of <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, for which I thank you. I read it over to &s;ome of my Friends that Evening; but being &s;ome what wearied in Body, having been a|broad all Day, I found no Di&s;po&s;ition to deli|ver your Me&s;&s;age in publick that Night; but the next Evening I thought I mu&s;t do it, and &s;o took your Letter in my Pocket when I went to Prayers, and after Prayers, I read about a Page and Half at the Beginning, and deliver|ed the Me&s;&s;age at the latter End, and as the Lord enabled, I did enlarge upon it both to the Converted and Unconverted, and the Hearts of &s;ome of God's Children were warmed and &s;ome others cried out under Concern. After Publick Wor&s;hip was over, they got together in another Room, and the Spark was &s;oon kindled into a Flame.&mdash;The Love of God was &s;hed abroad in many Hearts, and they &s;ang Prai&s;e to free Grace. One and another came running to me telling me how the Lord had
<PB N="15" REF="005373_0008_10182803878CF3F0">
revived their Souls. You will have a Ta&s;te of their Loves by the Letters they have &s;ent you, and I hope you will write them an An&s;wer as &s;oon as you can. But my Brother, I have not told you the one Half yet. The &s;ame Night that the Children of God were revived, was a Night of God's Power to four poor Souls. I can't particularly relate to you the Manner of their Conver&s;ion, it was very evident and won|derful to all around, mo&s;t of the Night was &s;pent in Prayer and Prai&s;e. Oh! How &s;weet was it, your Experience mu&s;t Witne&s;s? The next Morning, another young Woman, that had been crying with the Re&s;t the Night be|fore, was <HI>brought out of Darkne&s;s into marvel-Light.</HI>&mdash;Mo&s;t of that Day and the next, many Souls were filled with the Love of God, &s;ome were even overcome with the Power and Sweet|ne&s;s thereof.</P>
<P>In the Day of God's Power his People &s;hall be willing. Some Days pa&s;t we have had no great Stirring, what the Lord has further to do here, I know not. I can't yet tell, whe|ther the Lord will let me leave <HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> but Time will di&s;cover what the Will of the Lord is.</P>

<P>I Write the&s;e few Lines to you, that you may know, that I am very well in Health, as I hope you are al&s;o. I lived in this Hou&s;e of Mercy four Years, and the Lord was plea&s;ed to let me know what a mi&s;erable Sin|ner I was, and he made me able to wait upon him. It is nothing but Free Grace in Chri&s;t, and not for any Thing we can do, but for his Names Sake, that he &s;hould look upon &s;uch rebellious Worms of the Du&s;t as we are.

I have had in hearing your Letters to our dear Mr. <HI>Barber,</HI> namely the Night after they came to Hand.
