<ARGUMENT>
<P>As Congre&s;s mu&s;t by law provide at their next &s;e&s;&s;ion for any &s;imilar ca&s;es which may occur under the Briti&s;h treaty, and as it is of general importance to the citi|zens of the United States, the following examination of the ca&s;e of Jonathan Rob|bins, lately decided in the Di&s;trict Court of South Carolina, is with deference, &s;ub|mitted to their con&s;ideration.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As I believe you have not been much troubled with my remarks on any &s;ubject, I hope you will more readily excu&s;e the favor I now a&s;k, in reque&s;ting your attention to the pre&s;ent. I am induced to make them becau&s;e the que&s;tion is of very great public con&s;equence, and involves the deare&s;t and mo&s;t valuable rights of every man in the United States. It reaches all &s;ituations, as well the elevated and opulent, as the mo&s;t indigent. It affects the knowledge and independence of our judicials in the mo&s;t important manner; and as I know it has excited the &s;en&s;ibility of the people, and mu&s;t be &s;o far made the &s;ubject of enquiry in congre&s;s, as to enable them to provide for &s;imilar ca&s;es, I have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ome ex|amination

of it may be nece&s;&s;ary, in that &s;pirit of deference and delicacy in which all &s;uch enquiries &s;hould be conducted.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not go into a definition of the prin|ciples of a free government, and the ble&s;|&s;ings its citizens ought to expect; becau&s;e few of our own, even among&s;t the mo&s;t illi|terate, are ignorant of the nature of a re|pre&s;entative government, the right of &s;uff|rage, and the ine&s;timable privelege of the trial by jury in all ca&s;es in which their cha|racters, lives, or property are concerned. To a people &s;o informed, it is &s;carcely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to remark, that to men of feeling the value of character, of honorable fame, is dearer than life or property, or even the mo&s;t tender connections; that to all men, whether of the nice&s;t honor or otherwi&s;e, the love of life is dearer than that of pro|perty, and that they would readily &s;acrifice the one to pre&s;erve the other. Hence it follows, that tho&s;e privileges which guard the characters and lives of our citizens, are viewed with a more jealous eye, and will be a&s;&s;erted with more firmne&s;s and promptitude than even tho&s;e which protect their proper|ties, vigilant as they are with re&s;pect to the&s;e, A number of our citizens therefore, believing that the ine&s;timable privileges &s;e|cured to them by the con&s;titution and laws of the United States, have been affected in

<P>The &s;ignature made by the pri&s;oner to this affidavit in court, appeared to be in the &s;ame hand writing as the &s;ignature to the one made in 1791, from which circum|&s;tance it is pre&s;umable, that Jonathan Rob|bins is the pri&s;oner's real name. The body of the affidavit made in New-York, in 1796, was printed; the names, dates, &s;ig|natures, &amp;c. were filled up in writing; it had the notarial &s;eal of of John Kee&s;e, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> affixed, and had the appearance of be|ing a genuine paper deemed at that day by &s;eamen to be a protection.</P>
<P>It appears, however, by the re&s;ult, that
<PB N="12" REF="036121_0011_10084C309552B998">
the&s;e affidavits, and the que&s;tion, whether the pri&s;oner was an American, and an im|pre&s;&s;ed &s;eaman, or not? were, in the opi|nion of the court, altogether immaterial; the court would have felt it&s;elf bound to deliver up any re&s;pectable citizen of the U. States, if claimed under the circum&s;tances of the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>It appears by the preceding &s;tatement, that the judge, under the circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e, would feel him&s;elf obliged to de|liver up any "re&s;pectable citizen of the United States." I do not mention this be|cau&s;e he u&s;ed the words "re&s;pectable citi|zen;" but I do it to &s;hew, that this is a que&s;tion which &s;eriou&s;ly concerns every part of the community, and that no citizen, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s may oblige him to go to other countries, is hereafter &s;afe from &s;uch de|mands. It will not depend upon him to &s;ay, he is not a marine, or to &s;hew certifi|cates or proofs to the contrary; it will de|pend upon the force with which he is at|tacked, and the temper or violence of the officer who directs it. In&s;tances, it is &s;aid, have lately occurred, where not only the &s;eamen, but the pa&s;&s;engers have been im|pre&s;&s;ed, who, although declaring they were not &s;eamen, were &s;till impre&s;&s;ed as &s;uch, and obliged to perform their duties. No production of papers, no intreaties availed
<PB N="13" REF="036121_0012_10084C321C240A60">
them; they were compelled to &s;ubmit.&mdash;Had the&s;e men been enterpri&s;ing, or an opportunity offered, and they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of their oppre&s;&s;ors, and brought them into port, or had they, in the attempt to regain their freedom, been obliged to de&s;troy them, while the world would have applauded the act, the judge mu&s;t, from the deci&s;ion, have delivered them to a &s;imilar demand, neither influence, friends, or for|tune could &s;ave them; however &s;uperior in the&s;e, in political privileges they were only equal to the unknown and friendle&s;s Rob|bins; a con&s;i&s;tent and inflexible magi&s;trate mu&s;t view them with the &s;ame impartial eye; he mu&s;t give to them the &s;ame con|&s;truction of the law or con&s;titution; he could not vary them without the immediate, lo&s;s of character. An enlightened people therefore will as attentively, nay, they ought more carefully to guard them in the per&s;on of a poor or unprotected, than a rich or con&s;iderable man, The latter will always find powerful friends to &s;upport and protect his privileges; while the rights of the former may in &s;ilence and with impuni|ty be unattended to, merely becau&s;e he is unknown, and has not an advocate to a&s;&s;ert them. This would probably have been the ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, had not &s;ome
<PB N="14" REF="036121_0013_10084C34E2751B20">
gentlemen voluntarily offered them&s;elves to examine and di&s;cu&s;s its con&s;equences. The public are obliged to them: it is an excel|lent example; I hope it will be followed upon every occa&s;ion, and that it will make us infinitely more vigilant of our rights than ever. We mu&s;t never forget that in this country the poor and the rich, the hum|ble and the influential, are all entitled to equal privileges; that we ought to con&s;ider a violation of the rights of the mo&s;t indi|gent and unprotected man, as an injury to the whole; while we have a pen to guide, or a voice to lift, they &s;hould be con&s;tantly exerted again&s;t the exerci&s;e of tyranny or oppre&s;&s;ion, by whatever nation committed, or to whom&s;oever the violence may be done.</P>
<P>I now proceed to examine the ca&s;e, and the nature of the evidence, on which Mr. Bee determined to deliver Jonathan Rob|bins, to the demand of the Briti&s;h mini&s;|ter.</P>
<P>I believe it is the fir&s;t in&s;tance which has occurred, of a demand under the Briti&s;h treaty in the United States; certainly, in this &s;tate. The law re&s;pecting the delivery of fugitives from ju&s;tice was &s;ilent on the delivery of fugitives to foreign powers, tend therefore, the judge conceived him&s;elf not only authori&s;ed, but bound to inter|fere.
<PB N="15" REF="036121_0014_10084C36A68BF350">
By his own &s;tatement it appears to have been entirely a new ca&s;e, in which I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e he had con&s;iderable di&s;cre|tion, and was not bound by any particular legi&s;lative act to deliver on a mere affidavit, or any "trevial &s;urmi&s;e or hear&s;ay evi|dence." It was his duty to have maturely con&s;idered what were the legal import and meaning of the words, "Charged with murder and forgery," and how far, accord|ing to the laws of this country, there was &s;uch evidence of criminalty as would ju&s;tify the &s;ending any man, claiming to be a citi|zen, and not di&s;proved as &s;uch, from his country, to be tried by a foregn tribunal, and mo&s;t probably by a court martial.&mdash;The judge's auditors mu&s;t have been &s;urpri&s;ed when they heard him &s;ay, "that no man can be puni&s;hed by the laws of G. Britain without a trial; if he is innocent he will be acquitted; if guilty, he mu&s;t be puni&s;hed." This ob&s;ervation was by no means applicable to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; the true que&s;tion before the court was, whe|ther Jonathan Robbins, producing a nota|rial certificate of being a citizen of the United States, and a&s;&s;erting that he was impre&s;&s;ed by violence into the Briti&s;h &s;er|vice, was, from the nature of the affidavits before him, to be torn from his country and connections, and deprived of all the rights
<PB N="16" REF="036121_0015_10084C3BCC89BF50" MS="y">
of citizen&s;hip, and &s;ent to be tried by a foreign tribunal, acting with a jury, in the mo&s;t &s;ummary manner, and by martial law.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to equal legal know|ledge with the judge; but, I have &s;ometimes attended to points of this kind, and as far as I am able to form, am clearly of opi|nion that the pri&s;oner, not having been di&s;|proved to be a citizen of the United States, there was not &s;uch evidence before the court as ju&s;tified the judge in giving &s;o important an order, as to &s;urrender him to the de|mand of the Briti&s;h con&s;ul. This I will, endeavor to prove from the examination of the affidavits, and the nature of the te&s;ti|mony required by our laws, as &s;ufficient even to ju&s;tify the putting a citizen upon his trial in this country, without adding to it the inexpre&s;&s;ible di&s;grace and danger of &s;ending him to be tried by a foreign tribu|nal.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t affidavit is William Portlock, on which I &s;uppo&s;e the judge could not have re&s;ted at all; he appears from his age, and the &s;tatement in the affidavit, to have been a &s;ailor lad, as little known in this country as Robbins him&s;elf, and to have been &s;o illiterate as not to have been able to write his name. This lad &s;ays, he heard, a per&s;on who an&s;wered to the name of Na|than
<PB N="17" REF="036121_0016_10084C3E50EC17A0" MS="y">
Robbins, declare he was boat&s;wains's mate on board the Hermione, when the was carried into the port of "Cavilla;" and that &s;ometimes, when he was drunk, he would mention the Hermione, clench his fi&s;t, and &s;ay, "bad luck to her."</P>
<P>From the &s;tatement it re&s;ults, that this Portlock was an illiterate &s;ailor lad, &s;o ig|norant as not to know the name of the port the frigate was carried into. It does not appear that he was &s;hewn the pri&s;oner, or that he could &s;wear that Jonathan Rob|bins was the per&s;on he knew on board the Tanner's Delight; he avowedly knew no|thing of him&s;elf. He does not &s;ay the per|&s;on he &s;poke of, confe&s;&s;ed to him that he was concerned in the murder or piracy charged on him. From the youth, igno|rance, and &s;ituation of Portlock; from the vague and uncertain account he gave, I mu&s;t &s;till be of opinion that the judge could not have re&s;ted at all on his te&s;timony; he knew, that even if Portlock had &s;worn po&s;itively to the identity of Robbins, and the latter had, when &s;ober, made any con|fe&s;&s;ion of guilt to him, that it was the duty of a judge not to have attended to it.&mdash;Any confe&s;&s;ion of a criminal mu&s;t be made in a particular manner, before magi&s;trates, or in open courts, to operate to conviction. An elegant writer, treating on this &s;ubject,
<PB N="18" REF="036121_0017_10084C41078AFC08" MS="y">
&s;ays, "the confe&s;&s;ion of a criminal, when taken even before a magi&s;trate, can rarely be turned again&s;t him, without obviating the end for which he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have made it. Be&s;ides we have known in|&s;tances of murders avowed, which never were committed; of things &s;tolen, which had never quitted the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ow|ner."</P>
<P>The evidence of words alledged to have been &s;poken by the per&s;on accu&s;ed, and connected with the criminality of the charge, ought al&s;o to be received with great di&s;|tru&s;t.

The who&s;e of lieutenant Forbes's exa|mination &s;ays, that a man confined in the gaot of this di&s;trict, who calls him&s;elf Rob|bins, but who&s;e real name he believes to be Thomas Na&s;h, was a &s;eaman for a certain term on board the Hermione; that after he left the Hermione, &s;he was &s;eized by the crew and carried into an enemy's port; and that he has heard, from the depo&s;itions of others in courts-martial, that the man whom he believes to be named Thomas Na&s;h, was a principal in the commi&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid acts of piracy and murder, &amp;c.</P>
<P>From this account, Mr. Forbes has con|fe&s;&s;ed that he knows nothing of him&s;elf&mdash;that he was not &s;ure what the pri&s;oner's name was, but that he believes it to be Thomas Na&s;h, and what is extremely im|portant he does not attempt to &s;ay he is an Iri&s;hman, and not an American, or that he was not impre&s;&s;ed by violence into the Briti&s;h &s;ervice.

<P>His te&s;timony therefore, being altoge|ther hear&s;ay, ought, in &s;trictne&s;s of law, to have operated le&s;s forcibly upon the mind of the judge, than even Portlock's, for however more re&s;pectable as an officer and a gentleman, Mr. Forbes is, yet, when he tells you him&s;elf he was not on board the frigate when the murder and piracy was committed, and that he knows nothing but by hear&s;ay, either from the relations or de|po&s;itions of others, he at once comes with|in that de&s;cription of te&s;timony which the laws of England, and the deci&s;ion of the be&s;t judges, and our laws borrowed from them, forbid either a judge or a jury to receive in any ca&s;e affecting the life or a limb of a &s;ubject of the one, or a citizen of the other.</P>
<P>This being the &s;tate of the evidence be|fore the judge, two important que&s;tions ari&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Whether the judge was &s;trictly au|thori&s;ed; and ff there was a doubt, whether he ought to have decided alone upon this que&s;tion? And,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="21" REF="036121_0020_10084C4A5058CC98">
2dly, Whether in deciding, he had any and what di&s;cretion, as to the nature of the evidencee to be required, and whether his deci&s;ion was &s;uch as the &s;ecurity of the per|&s;onal privileges of our citizens, or the policy of the United States, demanded.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t que&s;tion&mdash;It appears that from the law of congre&s;s re&s;pecting the deli|very of fugitives from ju&s;tice from one &s;tate to another, being &s;ilent, the judge was of opinion, on the application being fir&s;t made to him, that it was a matter for executive interference; but that upon recon&s;ideration, as the law and the treaty were &s;ilent, he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of deciding. I think a further view of this &s;ubject mu&s;t have, by this time, convinced him that he was mi&s;ta|ken, and that no po&s;&s;ible con&s;truction that he can give to the 3d article of the con&s;titution, can ju&s;tify the opinion he formed, of his having a right to decide on this ca&s;e. The article re&s;pecting the judicial, after ve&s;ting in congre&s;s the right to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uperior and inferior tribunals, defines the important powers they &s;hall exerci&s;e, but leaves the boundaries of each to be a&s;certained by con|gre&s;s. They have accordingly detailed the duties and fixed the limits of the &s;upreme circuit and di&s;trict courts, in a manner &s;o clear, that it is a&s;toni&s;hing a doubt &s;hould
<PB N="22" REF="036121_0021_10084C4BE0AE2660">
have for a moment ari&s;en as to the court really having juri&s;diction to decide this que&s;|tion. The di&s;trict courts have no right to decide on any crime, where the puni&s;hment is to exceed 30 &s;ttripes, 100 dollars fine, and &s;ix mouths impri&s;onment: in any ca&s;e exceeding the&s;e and particularly for capital offences, however the judge like any other magi&s;trate, may on proper te&s;timony com|mit for trial here, he has no right to decid: this authority is given to the circuit courts.</P>
<P>Had therefore Robbins been committed for trial in this &s;tate, could Mr. Bee have tried him? Certainly not&mdash;he mu&s;t have re|mained to be tried by the circuit court.</P>
<P>With what authority, therefore, could he decide upon a que&s;tion, which not only went to dive&s;t the pri&s;oner of his right of ci|tizen&s;hip, bani&s;h him from his country, and deprive him of the trial by jury; but al&s;o to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the circuit court of a right to de|cide upon as new, delicate and important a &s;ubject as ever came before them: one which de hoped would have been re&s;erved for much more ample di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and con&s;ider|ation, and in which I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed the public would have been plea&s;ed to hear the opinions of all the mo&s;t experienced council at the bar, and to have &s;een decided by the &s;upreme court.</P>

It is no an&s;wer to &s;ay, that the 27th arti|cle of the treaty &s;peaks of commitment; be|cau&s;e the latter clau&s;e qualifies it, and makes this commitment depend upon the evidence of criminality according to our laws; and there is &s;urely an a&s;toni&s;hing difference be|tween a mere commitment for trial, and a delivery over to a foreign tribunal. Nor is it more to &s;ay that the law of Congrd&s;s re&s;pect|ing fugitives from ju&s;tice, in the different &s;tates, makes them deliverable on a bill found, or BY AN AFFIDAFIT, becau&s;e they are only removed from one &s;tate to another, where the &s;ame laws, &s;ame right of jury, and &s;ame forms exi&s;t; and what is equal to all, THE INVALUABLE RIGHT OF HABEAS CORPUS, where a pri&s;oner, improperly com|mitted, can, after delivery and removal, de|mand to be brought before a judge, and have the rea&s;ons of his confinement examin|ed. But where is the HABEAS CORPUS that can, in this &s;ituation, reach an unfor|tunate American? However &s;light or un|founded the accu&s;ation again&s;t him, or erro|neous the opinion of the SINGLE JUDGE who delivered him may be, when once dili|vered he is for ever deprived of this invalua|ble privilege.

<P>There is another important rea&s;on why the judge ought not, upon this occa&s;ion, SINGLY to have decided. I think if it had occurred to him he certainly would have po&s;tponed the deci&s;ion, until the meeting of the circuit court it is this&mdash;That however all nations may have agreed upon the pro|priety of delivering up fugitives from ju&s;tice, in the ca&s;e of forgery; yet, that in times of war, and particularly in revolutions, when different nations hold &s;uch oppo&s;ite opinions upon what are piracy or murder, and what ju&s;tifiable re&s;i&s;tance to tyranny and oppre&s;&s;i|on; when it is &s;o extremely difficult, and requires all the acutene&s;s, and all the know|ledge and experience of the able&s;t judges, to draw the line between them: mo&s;t certainly, in this country, our judges ought not to have decided, in ca&s;es that may hereafter be

quoted as precedents, without the utmo&s;t caution and deliberation.</P>
<P>They &s;hould have reflected, that in all trials where there was a claim of birth right or citizen&s;hip, on the part of the accu&s;ed, and where there was not the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t po&s;itive proof of his criminality, that it was &s;afe&s;t to try him here <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following is taken from the adver|ti&s;ement of the Briti&s;h government of An|tigua, April 14, 1798, de&s;cribing Thomas Na&s;h, with the other men that were on board the Hermoine:</P>
<P><Q>Thomas Na&s;h, an Iri&s;hman, one of the foreca&s;tle men, about 5 feet 10 inches high, dark complexion, long black hair, remarkably hairy about his brea&s;t, arms, &amp;c. had left the &s;hip in Porto Caballo; had entered on board either an American or Spani&s;h trading &s;chooner</Q></P>
<P>In this adverti&s;ement it is remarkable that Thomas Na&s;h is not called a warrant officer; he is only adverti&s;ed as a common &s;eaman, and not charged as one concerned in the murder of the officers. But the mo&s;t remark|able thing is this&mdash;that while Robbin's cer|tificate &s;ays he is a man five feet &s;ix inches high, the other, (that is the Antigua adver|ti&s;ement,) &s;ays he is five feet ten inches&mdash;Now, four inches is &s;o con&s;picuous a differ|ence in the height of a man, that &s;urely it was of &s;ufficient con&s;equence in fixing the identity to have de&s;erved attention.</P></NOTE> In this in&s;tance they ought certainly to have done &s;o. The te&s;|timony was &s;light and trivial; it was nearly ALL HEARSAY; it was indi&s;pen&s;ible there|fore to ju&s;tice, that the pri&s;oner &s;hould have had an opportunity of &s;ending to New-York
<PB N="26" REF="036121_0025_10084C576365AD10">
and Connecticut to prove, if he could in the ca&s;e of &s;uch delicate importance, and of &s;uch &s;light proof, could the Briti&s;h government have cen&s;ured the procedure. It was as ea|&s;y for them to &s;end their witne&s;&s;es here, as to have &s;ent an armed cutter to carry him away. Ju&s;tice would have been done to all parties; and venerating as their nation is &s;aid to do, the trial by jury, a generous and free people would have applauded the re&s;pect that was paid to it here.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd que&s;tion, it has been alrea|dy ob&s;erved, that this was a new ca&s;e, in which Congre&s;s had not legi&s;lated, and the more that if the judge thought proper to a&s;|&s;ume the power of deciding be was bound by no particular act or re&s;triction, but at li|berty to declare the nature of the evidence on which in his opioion &s;o important a deci&s;ion
<PB N="27" REF="036121_0026_10084C5A65EBBBB0">
&s;hould have been made. Suppo&s;ing him, as the di&s;trict Judge to have been at all au|thori&s;ed to decide his di&s;cretionary power, certainly it would have extended to this; and the point then for con&s;ideration is, that having the power to determine on what evi|dence &s;o important an order &s;hould be found|ed, what ought to have been his conduct, and what the nature of the proof he &s;hould have required? My own opinion decidedly is, that he &s;hould at lea&s;t have required &s;uch proofs as a grand jury would have thought &s;uffici|ent to find a bill. Perhaps he ought to have gone further, and before he con&s;ented to his removal into a foreign country and military tribunal, he &s;hould have demanded complete proof of his guilt, &s;uch as would have in|duced a petit jury to convict him. But that he &s;hould at lea&s;t have required the proof ne|ce&s;&s;ary to find a bill no one I think will contend. The enquiry then is what is the proof which the Engli&s;h law and the laws of this country require to enable a grand jury to find a bill? Although I think there are many defects in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice&mdash;&s;uch for in&s;tance as the dependance of the judges on the crown, from which they re|ceive their appointment, and to whom they may be looking up for further promotion and honor, that of being removable by an addre&s;s

from parliament, which a mini&s;ter can al|ways command, and who&s;e views and wi&s;h|es therefore none el&s;e but an inflexible ma|gi&s;trate will dare oppo&s;e; and particularly in the &s;heriffs having the power to &s;ummons whom they plea&s;e as jurors, and to pack them if they think proper: yet there is one part of their &s;y&s;tem which I have always admired&mdash;that is, the in&s;titution of a Grand Jury.</P>
<P>Their laws hare wi&s;ely and humanely con&s;idered, that next to the di&s;grace of be|ing convicted of an infamous offence, is the di&s;honour of being charged with one; and therefore, before they would &s;ubmit a &s;ubject to the danger and inconvenience of being publicly arraigned, an impartial jury are on their oaths to declare the ju&s;t cau&s;e for accu|&s;ation. We have copied their &s;y&s;tem, and improved upon it. Our juries cannot be packed; they are drawn by lot, and in my judgment criminal trials in this &s;tate are as perfect as they can be.</P>
<P>The nature of the evidence which can alone be properly offered to a grand jury, although not entirely conclu&s;ive as to the ac|tual guilt of the pri&s;oner, mu&s;t be &s;uch as if offered to the petit jury would be legal evi|dence&mdash;Even examinations taken agreeably to the 2d and 3d Philip and Mary, chapter
<PB N="29" REF="036121_0028_10084C685DA09070">
10, (of force in this &s;tate) can only be giv|en in evidence before a jury, when the court is &s;atisfied the witne&s;s is dead, unable to tra|vel, or kept away by the means or procure|ment of the pri&s;oner. No other examinati|ons can be given, or ought to be received in evidence; and a pre&s;entment founded upon any other, would not be that due pre&s;ent|ment, without which a citizen's life &s;hould not be put in danger.</P>
<P>The above opinion is founded on the highe&s;t law authorities. A learned En|gli&s;h judge, &s;peaking on this &s;ubject, &s;ays "The evidence to be given ought to ari&s;e to a high degree of probability&mdash;ab&s;olute po&s;itive proof if not to be in&s;i&s;ted upon before a grand jury; AND SLIGHT TRIVI|AL SUSPICION AND HEARSAY evidence, are not &s;ufficient to ground &s;uch pre&s;ent|ments upon; for although they are only in the nature of a charge, and do not carry a conviction, yet as many inconveniences, as well as expence and danger attend a charge of this &s;ort, which no &s;ubject ought to undergo, but upon legal and &s;ufficient evidence."</P>
<P>This is the law of England, on the &s;ub|ject of legal evidence &s;ufficient to enable a grand jury to find a bill. Our law is taken from, and founded on it; and the public can now judge whether the te&s;timony &s;ub|mitted

in this ca&s;e, was &s;uch as ought, in one of &s;o much importance and danger to the pri&s;oner, to have authorized his delivery.</P>
<P>Some di&s;tinctions are attempted to be drawn, re&s;pecting territory and juri&s;diction, the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner having contended that the treaty entirely alluded to the pecu|liar exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction of each. I have no doubt in my own mind, that Mr. Jay meant no other than the exclu&s;ive territorial juri&s;diction of each nation. He &s;eems to have carefully omitted the word piracy, aware of the difficulty I have before mention|ed, of di&s;tingui&s;hing between what may be called PIRACY, or what laudable re&s;i&s;tance to violence and oppre&s;&s;ion. This omi&s;&s;ion therefore mu&s;t once convince us, that Mr. Jay could only have meant private acts of premeditated and deliberative murder, ari&s;|ing from motives unconnected with any attempts which individuals, coming to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">e the citizens of this country might at any time make to free them&s;elves from the ty|ranny of impri&s;onment. It is wonderful however, to me, that Mr. Jay having &s;een the nece&s;&s;ity of omitting piracy, did not al&s;o omit, at lea&s;t during the exi&s;tence of the war murder al&s;o: For in attempts to regain ve&s;|&s;els or e&s;cape from impre&s;&s;ment, it is cer|tainly as difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h what is mur|der, as what is piracy. Upon an occa&s;ion
<PB N="31" REF="036121_0030_10084C6BA2FEA9F8">
of &s;uch importance to the future &s;afety of his fellow-citizens Mr. Jay certainly ought, and will I &s;uppo&s;e explain, what was his meaning in that article of the treaty. The quotations from Vattel and Rutherford did not apply at all. They are merely meant to refer to the ca&s;es of children born at &s;ea, to a&s;certain, as Vattel does very properly, that right as &s;ubject or citizens of the nation to which the ve&s;&s;el they are born in be|longs.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e that Vattel de&s;igned to extend the doctrine, &s;o far as to mean that the &s;hips of a nation are, with re&s;pect to the &s;pace of water they cover on the ocean, its rerritory as to juri&s;diction, as completely as its land or rivers are, is to prove him not only guil|ty of an incon&s;i&s;tency unbecoming &s;o well-informed an author, but to make him flatly contradict doctrines expre&s;&s;ed in other parts of his work. He then contradicts that neu|tral ve&s;&s;els do not make free goods; and it is on his authority the Briti&s;h re&s;t more than any other, their rights to &s;earch neutrals.</P>
<P>Among the rea&s;ons which &s;hould make our judges very cautious in deciding again&s;t the claim of citizen&s;hip, by per&s;ons a&s;&s;um|ing to be citizens, there is one PECULIAR TO THIS COUNTRY, and which &s;hould be carefully attended to: it is, the difficulty of di&s;tingui&s;hing between the natives of &s;ome
<PB N="32" REF="036121_0031_10084C704F087708">
of the middle and &s;outhern &s;tates and the natives of Ireland, Germany, and in &s;ome in&s;tances Scotland. The emigrations from tho&s;e countries, to America were formerly very great. Whole countries have been en|tirely &s;ettled by them, with &s;carce the inter|mixture of any other. Their children, hear|ing nothing but the language of their parents will as naturally have the German, Iri&s;h or Scotch accent, as if they were born in Europe. In&s;tances of this &s;ort mu&s;t have occurred to any man, the lea&s;t acquainted with the&s;e &s;tates. Indeed it is well known, that in &s;ome places many native Americans, born of German parents, have been met, who could not &s;peak the Engli&s;h language. If then any of the&s;e men, born of German parents, have become &s;eamen, will it not be impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h between them and Europeans.</P>
<P>And can there be a more fallacious mode of determining than from the voice or ac|cent. I know of none more &s;o, than that of the countenance; and to neither &s;hould an acute or experienced judge ever attend.</P>

look up as the true means of becoming an important naval power&mdash;of having the abil|ity to protect and guard their rights, and to in&s;ure to its citizens the ble&s;&s;ings of peace: they are more expo&s;ed to the attacks and in|&s;olence of powerful and overbearing nations than any other cla&s;s of our citizens, and are therefore more entitled to the care and at|tention of our public guardians. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing as the United States do, bulky products, ev|ery day increa&s;ing, and to export which great quantities of &s;hipping and number of &s;ea|men are nece&s;&s;ary, to what portion of their citizens can they look with more anxiety than to them?

to execute the treaty, and that the letter to the judge had no other intent. This I re|ally believe to be the ca&s;e; but the noi&s;e it has made will &s;hew the extreme impropriety of the higher executive officers of our gov|ernment ever touching in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner on any &s;ubject that may come be|fore the judicial. However innocent the intention, as I think it was in this in&s;tance, it is very apt to give ri&s;e to unfavourable opinions;&mdash;and none more dangerous to a community can be entertained, than that of a wi&s;h of the executive to influence the ju|dicial.
