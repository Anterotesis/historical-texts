<P>_THESE Words are the <HI>Clo&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Chapter,</HI> and the <HI>fir&s;t Ver&s;e</HI> of it informs us of the particular <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> on which the whole was uttered: "<HI>The Word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the Dearth.</HI></P>
<P>The Dearth here &s;poken of was caus'd by a great <HI>Drought,</HI> but God can bring Dearth upon us as well by <HI>Cold</HI> and <HI>Clouds,</HI> as by burning Drought.</P>

The <HI>Prophet,</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Church,</HI> and from <HI>Love</HI> to it, humbly mourns, bewails, com|plains, confe&s;&s;es, &s;upplicates, deprecates, and expo&s;tulates; in Words the mo&s;t moving and af|fecting you ever read: See from the 19 <HI>Ver&s;e, "Ha&s;t thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy Soul loathed Zion? why ha&s;t thou &s;mitten us and there is no healing for us? we looked for Peace and there is no Good, and for the Time of healing and behold Trou|ble! We acknowledge, O Lord, our Wickedne&s;s, and the Iniquity of our Fathers; for we have &s;inned a|gain&s;t thee. Do not abhor us for thy Name &s;ake; do not di&s;grace the Throne of thy Glory; remember, break not thy Covenant with us: Are there any among the Vanities of the Gentiles that can cau&s;e Rain? or can the Heavens give Showers? "Art not Thou He, O Lord our god? therefore will we wait upon Thee, for Thou ha&s;t made all the&s;e Things."</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e <HI>la&s;t</HI> Words the <HI>Prophet</HI> fir&s;t <HI>de&s;pi&s;es,</HI> di&s;dains, pours Contempt on, and rejects with Abhorrence the <HI>Gods</HI> of the <HI>Nations:</HI> "Are there any among the <HI>Vanities of the Gentiles</HI> that can give <HI>Rain?</HI> He gives to <HI>Idols</HI> their true Name <HI>Vanities;</HI> for we know that <HI>an Idol is nothing in the World.</HI> He affirms it univer&s;ally, of <HI>all</HI> and every <HI>one</HI> of them, that they are but &s;o many <HI>Vanities.</HI> He demands of them, if they can, on|ly to give <HI>Rain:</HI> One of the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> things, it is true, in Nature; yet one of the mo&s;t <HI>common</HI> things too, and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for Man. If they can't do <HI>this,</HI> what is there they can do for us? and if they could do this, what el&s;e might they not do?</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004130_0005_1003D23B9D31C528">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> He a&s;&s;igns to <HI>&s;econd Cau&s;es</HI> their Place and <HI>Limits; "Can the Heavens give Showers?</HI> either the <HI>upper</HI> or <HI>lower</HI> Heavens! As for the <HI>upper</HI> Heavens and all their <HI>Ho&s;ts,</HI> they are thus far concerned in our <HI>Rains,</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> exhales the Vapours by its fiery Rays, and the <HI>Moon</HI> in|fluences our Waters both in the Air and Sea, and the Fluids in our Bodies, in a &s;en&s;ible but &s;ecret manner. And as for the <HI>lower</HI> Heavens, the Region of our <HI>Clouds,</HI> they gather not by any Knowledge or De&s;ign of their own, neither when they give their Showers do they mean a|ny <HI>Benefit</HI> to us: For as <HI>Job</HI> &s;aid very piou&s;ly and ju&s;tly, "<HI>if I beheld the Sun when it &s;hone!</HI> &s;o mu&s;t we &s;ay, if I behold the <HI>Rain</HI> when it falls, with any religious Re&s;pect to the <HI>Creature</HI> it&s;elf, it were to deny the GOD that is above.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> GOD the <HI>fir&s;t Cau&s;e</HI> is devoutly ac|knowledged in the <HI>Government</HI> of all &s;econd Cau|&s;es, and in the <HI>Benefits</HI> done us by them; and all the <HI>Glory</HI> is render'd to <HI>Him</HI> alone, to Whom it is due: "<HI>Art not Thou He, O Lord our God? there|fore we will wait on Thee; for Thou ha&s;t made all the&s;e Things.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>Principle</HI> is laid down, in Form of <HI>Inter|rogation,</HI> but in Sen&s;e a vehement <HI>Affirmation:</HI> Thou <HI>art</HI> He, and <HI>Thou</HI> only! Thou the Lord <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the God of I&s;rael, thou only can&s;t <HI>cau&s;e Rain,</HI> and command the <HI>Heavens</HI> to give us Showers! Thou do&s;t it when and where thou plea&s;e&s;t, and thy Will and Providence governs herein! Who art <HI>greater</HI> than the Heavens and above them, ha&s;t made and rule&s;t them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="004130_0006_1003D2440E53B598">
2. A devout <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> is formed upon this <HI>Principle,</HI> a Re&s;olution of <HI>Dependance</HI> on God and of <HI>Application</HI> to Him at all Times: "<HI>Therefore will we wait upon Thee,</HI> for <HI>thou ha&s;t made all the&s;e things:</HI> a good <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> for the Re&s;olution; <HI>while the gods that made not the Earth and Heavens, let them peri&s;h from the Earth and from under the&s;e Heavens.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>We will wait upon thee:</HI> &s;hould not <HI>a People</HI> wait on <HI>their God?</HI> They declare their Expecta|tion to be only from Him, their Dependance to be &s;olely on Him, and their Confidence to be &s;trong in Him. They apply, and &s;eek and pray, and <HI>re&s;olve</HI> to continue herein, to Day, always and for evermore.</P>
<P>"<HI>For thou ha&s;t made all the&s;e things:</HI> the Earth, Waters, Air, Clouds, Sea&s;ons; and governe&s;t all for the Life and Good of Man. <Q>Thou ha&s;t given <HI>Being</HI> to all things, and thou give&s;t <HI>Laws</HI> to them, and they &s;erve the wi&s;e and gracious Intentions of thy <HI>Providence!</HI></Q> Thou <HI>with-holde&s;t</HI> the Rain, or thou &s;ende&s;t it in <HI>Judgment</HI> or for <HI>Mercy!</HI> "Therefore <HI>we will</HI> wait upon Thee; rely on thee, &s;eek to thee, tarry thy Time, be found in thy Way, and re&s;ign our Selves to thy Will.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrinal Ob&s;ervation</HI> from the Words might be this; "That the <HI>Supremacy,</HI> the uni|ver&s;al <HI>Providence</HI> and Agency of the <HI>Lord our God,</HI> does &s;trongly <HI>oblige</HI> us, and &s;hould engage and <HI>bind</HI> us, to be <HI>waiting</HI> upon Him at all <HI>Times</HI> and in every <HI>Ca&s;e;</HI> more e&s;pecially in our Times of <HI>Trouble,</HI> Straits and Difficulties.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004130_0007_1003D24880BB35C8">
Or in the Words of <HI>Another,</HI> "The <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God &s;hould engage, and his <HI>A&s;ufficiency</HI> en|courage our <HI>Attendance</HI> on Him, and our <HI>Expecta|tions</HI> from Him at all <HI>Times."</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only enquire into the <HI>Nature</HI> of this great <HI>Duty</HI> of Religion, our <HI>waiting</HI> on God; and then briefly &s;ugge&s;t a few <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> for it and <HI>Mo|tives</HI> to it.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>waiting</HI> on God implies and includes in it the following Things,</P>
<P N="1">1. Our fix'd <HI>Belief,</HI> our con&s;tant <HI>Remembrance,</HI> and actual <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> of God, his <HI>Perfection</HI> and governing <HI>Providence,</HI> and the <HI>Extent</HI> of it to e|very Thing in the World: that the <HI>Lord</HI> our <HI>God</HI> is <HI>one</HI> Lord, the <HI>living God</HI> and <HI>everla&s;ting King,</HI> in Heaven above and on Earth below; and that <HI>we</HI> and all things are under his mo&s;t wi&s;e, good, powerful and perfect <HI>Rule</HI> and Or|dering; without <HI>which</HI> not a Cloud gathers o|ver us, nor a Ray of the Sun &s;hines on us, nor a Spire of Gra&s;s grows under our Feet. We mu&s;t bear about with us always, wherever we are and what&s;over we do, want and &s;eek after, an abi|ding Sen&s;e of our <HI>Dependance</HI> on God; who up|holds all things by the Word of his Power, and the Eyes of all wait on Him; who holds <HI>our</HI> Soul in Life, feeds us every Day, and is <HI>our Life and the Length of our Days.</HI> Deut. xxx. 20.</P>
<P>This <HI>Belief in God</HI> is e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite to, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ed in, our waiting on Him: For he that cometh to God mu&s;t believe that He is, and have right and ju&s;t Apprehre|&s;ions of his ble&s;&s;ed Nature and &s;upream univer|&s;al
<PB N="6" REF="004130_0008_1003D24DAEBD5500">Government; what He is <HI>in Him&s;elf</HI> and <HI>to us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;equently, we cannot <HI>wait</HI> upon God, but with a Frame of <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> and high <HI>Adoration.</HI> The <HI>idea</HI> of a great and good God commands <HI>this</HI> from us, all his <HI>Works</HI> challenge it, and every <HI>Benefit</HI> we look for from Him. They are all <HI>va&s;t</HI> in them&s;elves, and &s;peak his <HI>Eternal Power and Godhead,</HI> and declare an Infinite Dominion, Wi&s;|dom, Goodne&s;s and Ju&s;tice For In&s;tance, Do we wait on God for the Light and <HI>Heat,</HI> or for the <HI>Shade</HI> and Moi&s;ture; it mu&s;t be in &s;uch a Frame and Po&s;ture of Soul as that, P&s;alm cxxxv. 6, 7. <HI>For I know that the Lord is great, and that our God is above all Gods! What&s;oever the Lord plea&s;ed that did he in Heaven, and in Earth, in the Seas and in all deep Places: He cau&s;eth the Vapours to a&s;cend from the Ends of the Earth, he maketh Lightnings for the Rain, he bringeth the Wind out of his Trea&s;uries:</HI> And in the xxxiii P&s;alm; <HI>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Ho&s;t of them by the Breath of his Mouth; He gathereth the Waters of the Sea together as an heap, he layeth up the Depths in Store-hou&s;es; Let all the Earth fear the Lord, let all the Inhabitants of the World &s;tand in Awe of Him!&mdash; Behold, the Eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his Mercy; to deliver their Soul from Death, and to keep them alive in Fa|mine; Our Soul waiteth on the Lord, He is our Help and our Shield; for our Heart &s;hall rejoice in Him, becau&s;e we have tru&s;ted in his Holy Name: Let thy Mercy, O Lord, be upon us according as we hope in Thee.</HI></P>

3. We are in a more &s;pecial and proper Sen&s;e <HI>waiting on God</HI> in the regular Di&s;charge of the Duty of <HI>Prayer;</HI> &s;erious con&s;tant and fervent Prayer to God for all we <HI>want.</HI> What Prayer or Supplication &s;oever we make to God, mental or oral, private or public, we are therein wait|ing upon God, lifting our Hearts and Eyes and Hands to Him; and He that &s;earcheth the Heart knows the Mind of our Spirits. If we <HI>ask,</HI> and <HI>&s;eek</HI> and <HI>knock,</HI> as our <HI>Lord</HI> directs us, Matth. vii. this to <HI>wait;</HI> but the prayerle&s;s Per|&s;on profanely neglects God, waits not on him in his <HI>Clo&s;et</HI> from Day to Day, nor <HI>watches at his Gates,</HI> the Gates of <HI>Zion,</HI> his Hou&s;e of <HI>Prayer</HI> to all People. &mdash; Our <HI>Text</HI> is it &s;elf a fervent holy <HI>Prayer</HI> to God, as the Governour of the <HI>Sea&s;ons,</HI> as the <HI>Father of the Rain.</HI> God expects to be thus acknowledged by us, to receive this <HI>Homage</HI> from us. Zech. x. 1. <HI>Ask of the Lord Rain,&mdash;and be will give Showers and Gra&s;s.</HI> And if we want the <HI>Shi|ning of the Sun</HI> after the Rain, it is the &s;ame thing; we mu&s;t &s;eek and cry to God for it. And in the&s;e Ca&s;es the People of God are ready to <HI>pray,</HI> and enquire <HI>early</HI> after God; to <HI>howl</HI> to him for <HI>Corn and Wine and Oil,</HI> tho they do but <HI>flatter</HI> him with their Lips, and <HI>lie</HI> to him with their Tongues. Even the <HI>Prie&s;ts of Baal</HI> in the Day of <HI>Drought</HI> waited on their <HI>deaf Idol,</HI> with loud <HI>Cries</HI> from Morning to Evening, to an&s;wer them either by <HI>Fire</HI> or <HI>Water; "O Baal hear us! Elijah</HI> made one loud and fervent <HI>Petition</HI> to the living God, and <HI>the Heavens gave Showers.</HI> &mdash; Generally, thro' the <HI>Book</HI> of God, the required <HI>Waiting on Him</HI> means Prayer and <HI>Supplications</HI> for Things agreable to his Will, and in a Manner</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="8" REF="004130_0010_1003B554AAFD0CF8">
4. We mu&s;t <HI>wait</HI> upon God with <HI>upright Hearts,</HI> true and &s;trong <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of Soul to his Name, with <HI>Affection and Earne&s;tne&s;s.</HI> The acceptable and <HI>effectual</HI> Prayer of the <HI>Righteous</HI> is the <HI>fervent</HI> one. St. <HI>James</HI> v. Cold and <HI>formal</HI> Praying is not meet to be called <HI>waiting</HI> on God. "<HI>Our Soul waiteth for the Lord;</HI> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>more than they that watch for the Morning:</HI> and he <HI>repeats the Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> to expre&s;s the Truth and Vehemence of his De&s;ire. The Dawn of the <HI>Morning-Light</HI> is not more earne&s;tly <HI>long'd after</HI> by One in <HI>Pain</HI> on his bed thro' a long <HI>re&s;tle&s;s Night;</HI> than is the Favour and Mercy of God by a Soul that waits on Him therefor. "<HI>I wait for the Lord, my Soul doth wait, and I hope in his Word; Lord hear my Voice, and let thine Ear be attentive to my Supplica|tions.</HI> Such are the Breathings of the earne&s;t waiting Soul; "<HI>Lord all my De&s;ire is before thee, and my Groaning is not hid from thee; with my Soul have I de&s;ired thee in the Night, and with my Spirit within me will I &s;eek thee early.</HI> All the Powers and Affections of our Souls mu&s;t be excited and engaged in our waiting on God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Humble and ardent <HI>Hope, Expectation, Tru&s;t</HI> and <HI>Confidence</HI> are implied in our <HI>waiting</HI> upon God. To <HI>wait</HI> on Him is to <HI>depend,</HI> rely, and expect from his Power and Goodne&s;s, accord|ing to the <HI>promi&s;es</HI> of his Word. We are direct|ed to <HI>ask in Faith,</HI> and are told that <HI>believing</HI> we receive. <HI>Abraham</HI> was <HI>&s;trong</HI> in Faith, giving <HI>Glory</HI> to God; being <HI>fully</HI> per&s;waded that what he had <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> he was <HI>able</HI> to per&s;orm; and it was <HI>imputed</HI> unto him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s; as it is to Us al&s;o, if we <HI>believe</HI> on Him that rai&s;ed up <HI>Je&s;us</HI> our Lord from the dead, Rom. iv. 20.

<P>In &s;uch a Spirit of Faith and <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> the Pro|phet prays in our <HI>Context, "O the Hope of I&s;rael, the Saviour of it in the Time of Trouble! Remember, break not thy Covenant! Do not abhor us for thy Name's &s;ake, di&s;grace not the Throne of thy Glory! Art not Thou He, O Lord our God! Therefore we wait on thee.</HI></P>
<P>This is <HI>waiting</HI> and praying thro' the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> of <HI>David</HI>

<P N="2">II. I come briefly to mention a few <HI>Rea&s;ons, Motives</HI> and <HI>Arguments,</HI> for our re&s;olving on and engaging in this Duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. God is <HI>great</HI> and it is <HI>meet</HI> we &s;hould wait on Him. <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> expect much wait|ing on them. It is the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> Homage to the <HI>King Eternal,</HI> Immortal, the ble&s;&s;ed and only Poten|tate. Should we not daily attend his <HI>Levee?</HI> not in Ceremony and Compliment, or for any Need of our Services, but to expre&s;s a &s;incere Loyalty and humble <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and to acknowledge an ab&s;olute Subjection and Dependance. Zeph. iii. 8. <HI>Therefore wait ye upon me, &s;aith the Lord, until the Day that I ri&s;e up.</HI> Luke xii. 36. <HI>And be ye your &s;elves like unto Men that wait for their Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Favour, <HI>Gifts and Bounties of a God</HI> are well <HI>worth</HI> our waiting for. In&s;tance if you plea&s;e in the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Rain</HI> from Heaven, do they not <HI>de&s;erve</HI> more than all the Pains that we can be at in our Dependance on God, or Supplications to Him? Do they not <HI>pay</HI> us well for our repea|ted urging Prayers? Doth not the <HI>Husbandman</HI> wait for them <HI>with long Patience,</HI> after much Toil and Labour, that he may receive the Fruits of the Earth? <HI>James</HI> v. 7. And when he has reap'd a good <HI>Harve&s;t,</HI> thinks him&s;elf well recompens'd for his Summer's Work! But how great and good are the Ble&s;&s;ings of <HI>Grace,</HI> which our God e&s;pecially requires us to be waiting on him for! Luke xii. 23: <HI>It is your Fathers good Plea&s;ure to give you the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="20" REF="004130_0022_1003D2B199B22FA0">
3. All things <HI>wait</HI> upon God, and he is glo|rified in them. In this <HI>Way</HI> it is that we give him <HI>Honour,</HI> and do him <HI>Glory.</HI> So we acknow|ledge his Power, Goodne&s;s and Sovereignty, and te&s;tify our Dependance on Him, Subjection to Him, and Receipts from Him. P&s;al. cxxiii. 2. <HI>Behold, as the Eyes of Servants look unto the Hand of their Ma&s;ters, and as the Eyes of a Maiden unto the Hand of her Mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;o our Eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have Mercy upon us.</HI> We wait as <HI>Beggars</HI> for an Alms, as <HI>Children</HI> for a Father's Regard and Ble&s;&s;ing, and as <HI>Subjects</HI> on their Prince for his Favour and Reward, and at the &s;ame Time to know his Plea&s;ure and do his Will.

We need to care for our <HI>Souls,</HI> more than for our Bodies; that <HI>the&s;e</HI> may feed and flouri&s;h under the Word of Life: This <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> is more than the <HI>Dew of Heaven, the Fatne&s;s of the Earth, or Plenty of Corn and Wine.</HI> O if the <HI>Lord</HI> would make <HI>his Face to &s;hine upon his San|ctuaries,</HI> in the Efficacy of his Word and the Conver&s;ion of Souls! This is the <HI>Con&s;olation</HI> we &s;hould be waiting for in the <HI>Temple!</HI> the&s;e the richer <HI>Dews of Hermon</HI> de&s;cending on the <HI>Moun|tains of Zion,</HI> where the Lord commands the Ble&s;&s;ing, even <HI>Life for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>Let us wait on God in all his <HI>Ordinances</HI> that his <HI>Doctrine</HI> may drop as the <HI>Rain,</HI> and the <HI>Light</HI> of the Knowledge of his Glory <HI>&s;hine into our Hearts</HI> by and with his <HI>Word.</HI> Let us lift up our Eyes and Hearts to <HI>Him</HI> that is above the Hea|vens, and pray &mdash; "<HI>Drop down ye Heavens from above, ond let the Skies pour down Righteou&s;|ne&s;s!</HI> It follows, <Q>Let the Earth open and let
<PB N="23" REF="004130_0025_1003D2C902375A30">them bring forth <HI>Salvation,</HI> and let Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;pring up together: I the <HI>Lord</HI> have created it! Wo unto him that &s;triveth with his <HI>Maker;</HI> let the <HI>Pot&s;herd</HI> &s;trive with the Pot&s;herds of the Earth; &s;hall the <HI>Clay</HI> &s;ay to Him that fa&s;hions it, <HI>what make&s;t thou?</HI></Q> <HI>Men</HI> are but broken <HI>Pot&s;herds</HI> (&s;ays <HI>One</HI> on the Place) and are often made &s;o by their <HI>mutual Contentions,</HI> da&s;hed <HI>in pieces</HI> one again&s;t another.</P>
<P>What faith the <HI>Apo&s;tle?</HI> Galat. v. 5. <HI>We thro' the Spirit wait for the Hope of Righteou&s;ne&s;s by Faith.</HI> There is nothing worthy of a <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> waiting for like <HI>this;</HI> nothing in Compari&s;on of it. It is highly <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> to God to &s;ee us waiting on him for this, and his <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> is full on this point, Luke xi. 13. <HI>Shall not your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?</HI> This Ble&s;|&s;ing of Ble&s;&s;ings is the <HI>Hope</HI> of Believers, and it is <HI>the Hope of Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> the <HI>Promi&s;e of the Father</HI> which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> left with his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> in his <HI>Farewell Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> with them: <Q>who when He &s;hould come would <HI>convince the World of Sin, of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and of Judgment:</HI></Q> A <HI>Hope</HI> foun|ded on the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;anctifying to us and keeping us in the Ways of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s. <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t</HI> allows us not to <HI>hope</HI> on any other <HI>Ground,</HI> nor in any other <HI>Way,</HI> but warrants us in <HI>this.</HI> And it is <HI>thro' the Spirit,</HI> un|der <HI>his</HI> Direction and Influence, that we are <HI>be|gotten</HI> unto the lively <HI>Hope,</HI> and are kept <HI>waiting</HI> for it. And they that <HI>thus</HI> wait upon God, that wait on Him <HI>for this,</HI> &s;hall never be <HI>a&s;hamed of their Hope.</HI></P>
