<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ver. 8.</NOTE> &s;peaks of this Gift, "<HI>God is able to make</HI> ALL GRACE <HI>to abound to you, that ye always having an Al&s;ufficiency in all things, may abound to every good Work.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, The <HI>Grace</HI> and the <HI>Gift by Grace</HI> here &s;poken of, is neither more nor le&s;s than the particular Grace of <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Liberality</HI> to the Poor and Needy; an enlarged Heart and open Hand to relieve and &s;up|ply them in their Wants and Nece&s;&s;ities. &mdash; The whole <HI>Chapter</HI> is on this &s;ingle <HI>Subject</HI> and Argument, touching <HI>Mini&s;tring to the Saints,</HI> v. 1. <HI>as a Ma&s;ter of Bounty,</HI> v. 5. <HI>&s;owing bountifully,</HI> v. 7. <HI>giving to the Poor,</HI> v. 9 <HI>&s;upplying the Wants of Saints,</HI> v. 12. <HI>liberal Di|&s;tribution to all Men:</HI> This is the <HI>exceeding Grace</HI> and <HI>un&s;peakable Gift,</HI> for which <HI>Thanks</HI> is here given to God.</P>
<P>And great is the <HI>Honour and Glory</HI> done it, in the <HI>Epithet</HI> UNSPEAKABLE, and in the THANKSGIVING to God for it.</P>
<P>"<HI>Who can by &s;earching find out</HI> GOD, or any <HI>Gift</HI> of His, <HI>unto Perfection?</HI> Who can <HI>&s;hew forth all his Prai&s;e?</HI> All is comprehended in the one Word LOVE. Yet my <HI>Text</HI> means not to dignify a Spirit of <HI>Liberality</HI> a|bove the <HI>other</HI> Exerci&s;es of Grace, &s;ave only as the <HI>Great|e&s;t</HI> of all is <HI>Charity</HI>

Neverthele&s;s it mu&s;t be added, that <HI>Love</HI> in this particular <HI>Mode</HI> and Mini&s;tration, of which my <HI>Text</HI> &s;peaks, will <HI>&s;oon fail;</HI> for there are no Objects of <HI>Charity</HI> in <HI>Heaven,</HI> none <HI>poor</HI> or <HI>needy</HI> there: How|ever, <HI>Benevolence,</HI> the Soul and <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of Charity, <HI>reigns</HI> there in Glory for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD that we have <HI>&s;omething</HI> and &s;o <HI>much</HI> of it on <HI>Earth,</HI> in our <HI>Way</HI> to Heaven: "<HI>Thanks</HI> to <HI>Him</HI> for it, &s;ays my <HI>Text.</HI> The Glory is <HI>God</HI>'s, for it is

<P>GOD is the free and bountiful <HI>Author</HI> of this Grace in any, He <HI>gives</HI> it to Tho&s;e that have it; the Ability and the Heart to do kind and liberal Things is from <HI>Him;</HI> He puts it into the Heart, and he enlarges it. "Even Power to <HI>eat</HI> our Bread is from Him, how much more to <HI>give</HI> of it to <HI>others,</HI> to <HI>&s;even</HI> and al&s;o to <HI>eight</HI>

<P>The <HI>liberal Man</HI> is God's Gift to the World; to the <HI>Place</HI> where he lives, to <HI>di&s;tant</HI> Places al&s;o, if he have a Hand full and <HI>&s;trong</HI> eno' to &s;catter far and near. Some in the Churches of <HI>Macedonia</HI> were thus made to <HI>differ</HI> and excel: God mini&s;tred <HI>&s;eed</HI> to them and they &s;owed plentifully; God <HI>curiched</HI> them unto all Bountifulne&s;s, and the <HI>Thank&s;giving</HI> was abundant to God.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> is not to the charitable Per&s;on, who <HI>de|vi&s;es</HI> the liberal Things, but to <HI>God</HI> who gives him the Heart. The good Man will be <HI>far</HI> from taking any of the Prai&s;e to him&s;elf, but to <HI>God's Name</HI> he gives the Glory. "<HI>It is not in me,</HI> &s;aid the Princely <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> when <HI>Pharaoh</HI> asked him of the <HI>un&s;peakable Gift</HI> he heard was in him; "<HI>God &s;hall give Pharaob an An&s;wer of Peace</HI>

<P>We mu&s;t have a great Care not to <HI>idoli&s;e</HI> tho&s;e whom God plea&s;es to honour, by &s;acrificing to them in&s;tead of God, who alone is to be wor&s;hip'd. Yet the <HI>Man</HI> who is God's Hand, and his <HI>Gift,</HI> comes in for a civil Honour and Re&s;pect, a grateful Acknowledgment of his own Goodwill in &s;hewing the <HI>Kindne&s;&s;es of God:</HI> of which our <HI>Context</HI> is full, <Q>For to their <HI>Power</HI> and beyond

<PB N="5" REF="004352_0007_10044932EA9AF798">and my <HI>Context</HI> confines me to <HI>this</HI> Con&s;ideration of it, "as the <HI>Grace of God be&s;towed on the Churches,</HI> and the <HI>Fellow&s;hip of mini&s;tring to the Saints.</HI> So that a <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> in the Heart, and the <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of it in the Life, are here &s;uppo&s;ed: That is to &s;ay, a giving to the poor and needy from <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Word,</HI> from <HI>Love</HI> to Him and his <HI>People,</HI> upon the <HI>Commandment</HI> and <HI>Pro|mi&s;es</HI> of the Go&s;pel; in <HI>Obedience</HI> to the one, and <HI>Hope</HI> in the other.</P>
<P>It is not therefore meerly a <HI>humane,</HI> tender, generous <HI>natural Temper,</HI> or <HI>acquired</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition towards a nece&s;&s;i|tous or compa&s;&s;ionable Object; and yet <HI>this</HI> is a di&s;tin|gui&s;hing <HI>Gift</HI> of Providence to &s;ome more than others, which renders 'em more <HI>lovely</HI> and of a &s;uperior Spirit; but we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a Soul of this Di&s;po&s;ition <HI>&s;anctified,</HI> and acting upon religious <HI>Principles and Motives;</HI> or one of <HI>another</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition <HI>changed</HI> by the Power of Di|vine Grace into <HI>this;</HI> and then what rais'd and <HI>enobled</HI> Souls do the one and other become? <HI>all their Things being done with Charity!</HI> from a reigning Love to God and Goodne&s;s as &s;uch, as there is Opportunity unto <HI>all Men,</HI> but e&s;pecially unto the <HI>Hou&s;hold of Faith,</HI> proving their Love before the <HI>Churches.</HI></P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e a &s;pecial Exerci&s;e of proper Evangelical <HI>Faith</HI> with <HI>Love</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed, as in the <HI>Frame</HI> of Spirit, &s;o in the cho&s;en <HI>Objects,</HI> poor <HI>Saints</HI> and Members of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> for <HI>His</HI> &s;ake, and as unto <HI>Him,</HI> and as He will accept and reward another Day; "<HI>Ye did it unto Me.</HI> This is <HI>Chri&s;t form'd in us,</HI> his Spirit ruling in us, a <HI>new Nature</HI> given to us, acting in new Manner, on new Principles, Ends and Motives; &s;uch as the meer <HI>natural</HI> Man perceives not, in equal or greater Benefac|tions; a <HI>Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God.</HI></P>
<P>It is <HI>ea&s;y</HI> to the <HI>Power</HI> of God and <HI>worthy</HI> of his <HI>Mercy,</HI> &s;o to change the Heart of the naturally <HI>Niggard</HI> &amp; grudg|ing, into this <HI>Riches</HI> of Benignity and Beneficence, whereof there &s;eem to have been <HI>many In&s;tances</HI> in the <HI>fir&s;t Days</HI> of the Go&s;pel, upon the <HI>pouring</HI> out of the <HI>Spirit;</HI> when the <HI>Multitude</HI> of them that believed were

The like therefore has not been known in <HI>ordinary</HI> Times, nor is it the <HI>&s;tanding</HI> Exerci&s;e of the <HI>Spirit</HI> in the &s;anctified. But the <HI>Want</HI> of what &s;hould be <HI>common</HI> among Chri&s;tians at <HI>all</HI> Times, is a &s;ad and <HI>dark</HI> Te&s;timony of the <HI>Poverty</HI> of Grace; for there certainly are among us People of <HI>high Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> who have <HI>no</HI> Heart to do almo&s;t any thing at all, in a way of <HI>Di&s;tribution</HI> to the Poor, or for pious U&s;es; no not a known In&s;tance for Years together; while God is liberally giving to them, and they can lay up and lay out and make Purcha&s;es! but if you &s;peak of <HI>giving,</HI> they <HI>hide them&s;elves from their own Fle&s;h,</HI> even tho' they be e&s;teemed <HI>Members of Chri&s;t</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>Let us always &s;ee to it, that our <HI>Principle and End</HI> be right before God, genuine and truly <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> that neither <HI>Vanity,</HI> Affectation or O&s;tentation, nor yet meer <HI>Humanity</HI> and good Nature, be <HI>pa&s;s'd on God</HI> for gra|cious <HI>Charity,</HI> on Whom it cannot; nor yet on <HI>Men,</HI> nor on <HI>our &s;elves,</HI> which al&s;o is next to impo&s;&s;ible under our Illuminations by the Go&s;pel. Wherefore our <HI>Lord,</HI> according to the infinite Wi&s;dom and Sanctity of God in Him, has warned us to <HI>take heed how we do our Alms,</HI> Ie&s;t we have no Reward from <HI>our Father in Heaven.</HI> Matth. vi.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am now to &s;how, that this Evangelical Chri&s;tian <HI>charitable Frame</HI> of Spirit is an <HI>un&s;peakable Gift of God.</HI></P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. Literally true it is, that <HI>no Tongue</HI> of Man can duely &s;peak of it, or enough prai&s;e and <HI>celebrate</HI> it. It is above all our Thoughts and Words, we can neither think or &s;peak of it as it merits. Such is every <HI>Work</HI> and Gift of God in the Kingdom of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Providence.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="004352_0009_100441C675C1FE50">"See that thou <HI>magnify</HI> the&s;e vi&s;ible Works, which <HI>Eyes of Fle&s;h</HI> behold. "<HI>His Work is honourable and glorious, and his Prai&s;e endureth for Ever.</HI> How much more his <HI>Spiritual Work,</HI> the <HI>Gift by Grace</HI> within thy Self and Others. The <HI>Angels</HI> of God <HI>pry</HI> &s;ilently into <HI>this,</HI> and we need <HI>their</HI> Eyes and Tongues to look into it and &s;peak of it. "Ble&s;s the Lord ye his <HI>Angels</HI> that excel in Strength! and "<HI>awake up our Glory</HI> too, though we be but <HI>Babes and Sucklings</HI> in compari&s;on of Them; for from <HI>our</HI> Mind and Mouth God has <HI>ordained</HI> Strength.&mdash;We <HI>li&s;p</HI> and &s;tammer at a proper Word, and poorly apprehend many of the Great Words put into our Mouth. "Let Him <HI>teach</HI> us what we &s;hall &s;ay! and &s;hall it be <HI>told</HI> Him that we &s;peak! who can <HI>utter</HI> his mighty Acts, or &s;hew forth all his Prai&s;e! &mdash;Ac|cordingly the Apo&s;tle <HI>labours</HI> in my <HI>Context,</HI> to &s;peak of the <HI>Gift</HI> of God; &s;eems at a <HI>lo&s;s,</HI> &s;peaks abundantly, over and over, and knows not when he has &s;aid enough of the excellent Grace: <Q><HI>Inriched,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>in every thing,</HI> to all <HI>Bountifulne&s;s,</HI> which is <HI>abundant</HI> by many Thank&s;givings to God, from tho&s;e that <HI>long</HI> after you for the <HI>exceeding</HI> Grace of God in you.</Q>&mdash; If a Man wou'd &s;peak of a thing <HI>un&s;peakable,</HI> it mu&s;t be ju&s;t after <HI>this manner;</HI> it being literally true, that <HI>no Tongue</HI> of Man can fully &s;peak the Prai&s;es of Chri&s;tian <HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Un&s;peakable</HI> is the <HI>Good done</HI> in the World by a right <HI>charitable</HI> Frame of Spirit. Un&s;peakable are the <HI>Needs</HI> which Sin has brought upon us, not only on the <HI>poor and low</HI> of the World, but al&s;o on <HI>others,</HI> even on the riche&s;t and highe&s;t. We un&s;peakably need one anothers <HI>Help</HI> and Service, and un&s;peakable are the <HI>Benefits</HI> we receive from others in our Nece&s;&s;ities. The <HI>poor</HI> &s;erve the <HI>rich</HI> abundantly, more e&s;pecially in their <HI>Sickne&s;&s;es;</HI> and very often do it <HI>gratis,</HI> for nothing, out of pure Humanity, Re&s;pect and Compa&s;&s;ion, and are never requited: Sometimes from <HI>Gratitude</HI> for Favours received, and as often (I would wi&s;h) from a Principle of <HI>Grace</HI> within them, it being all the Way they have to expre&s;s a <HI>pious Love</HI> to God &amp; their Neighbours.&mdash;Others to whom God has given Riches, and <HI>Largene&s;s</HI> of Heart
<PB N="8" REF="004352_0010_1004498640425090">to do Good with it, give <HI>Portions</HI> to the Poor by &s;evens and eights, and by &s;cores and hundreds; <HI>devi&s;ing</HI> li|beral things, and ca&s;ting their <HI>Bread</HI> upon the Waters. <Q>The <HI>Bowels</HI> of the poor are refre&s;hed by them, they are Eyes to the <HI>blind</HI> and Feet to the <HI>lame,</HI> Parents to the <HI>Fatherle&s;s,</HI> and they cau&s;e the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Heart to &s;ing; the Ble&s;&s;ing of them that are ready to <HI>peri&s;h</HI> comes on them, and of him that is <HI>helple&s;s.</HI></Q> They are as the Heat and Rain to a thir&s;ty and cold Earth, as the <HI>Light</HI> of the Morning and the <HI>Dews</HI> of the Even|ing to tho&s;e among whom they dwell, who pa&s;s their <HI>Days and Nights</HI> the better for their Neighbourhood. <Q>Their Glory is <HI>fre&s;h</HI> in them, and their <HI>Bow</HI> is re|newed in their Hand.</Q> They live not to <HI>Them&s;elves,</HI> but others <HI>glean</HI> by handfuls of what they plentifully &s;owe. God <HI>multiply</HI> their Seed &s;own, and <HI>increa&s;e</HI> the Fruits of their Righteou&s;ne&s;s; while the <HI>Loyns</HI> of the Poor ble&s;s them, warm'd with the <HI>Fleece</HI> of their Flock.

Un&s;peakable (you &s;ee) is the <HI>Good done</HI> in this needy World, and <HI>Heaven</HI> ac|knowledges it to be &s;o, and accordingly <HI>rates the Gift</HI> in the Book of Account.</P>
<P N="3">3. Un&s;peakable is <HI>the Glory redounding to</HI> GOD from a right Chri&s;tian <HI>charitable</HI> Frame of Spirit, in the noble humble Exerci&s;e of it thro' the Earth, and therefore is it an <HI>un&s;peakable Gift.</HI> This is a <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> or Argument that ri&s;es much higher than the former; for if it be a good and great Thing to do much Good to our Fellow-Crea|tures, how much more is it to be any Ways In&s;trumen|tal in any <HI>Glory and Honour</HI> to the Name of GOD? Yet HE <HI>is glorified</HI> (&s;ays my Context) by <HI>Others,</HI> on the Account of the Acts of <HI>Bounty</HI> done them by their mer|ciful Neighbour.</P>
<P>The Great and bountiful <HI>God</HI> makes <HI>much,</HI> makes the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of our <HI>little Alms</HI> and Offerings to Him: As our <HI>Saviour</HI> did of the <HI>Widow's two Mites;</HI> they were

III. The <HI>highe&s;t Thank&s;givings</HI> are due from us to the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed God,</HI> for this <HI>his un&s;peakable Gift</HI> to any of the Children of Men; and &s;hould be <HI>fervently render'd</HI> to Him in the <HI>Churches</HI> of his Saints. "<HI>Thanks be to God for his un&s;peakable Gift.</HI></P>
<P>But (as was &s;aid before) <HI>what</HI> Thanks can <HI>we</HI> ren|der, when the Gift is <HI>un&s;peakable?</HI> O 'tis <HI>above</HI> all our Prai&s;es and Ble&s;&s;ings! Yet as the <HI>Levites</HI> &s;aid to the Augu&s;t Congregation, Nehem ix. 5. "<HI>Stand up and ble&s;s the Lord your God for ever and ever! and ble&s;&s;|ed be thy glorious Name which is exalted above all Prai&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;ay <HI>two</HI> Things here,</P>
<P N="1">1. They that <HI>receive</HI> the Gift &s;hould be very <HI>thank|ful</HI> to God for it. The charitable Per&s;on &s;hould him|&s;elf give <HI>Thanks</HI> to God for making him &s;o, while yet he <HI>aba&s;es</HI> him&s;elf before the Lord, as an unprofitable Creature, and behaves humble and lowly before <HI>Men.</HI> Yet ought he to glorify God for any <HI>Heart</HI> to do good, and for any <HI>Means</HI> to do it. He mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume nothing to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> but a&s;cribe all to <HI>God;</HI> of Whom and <HI>to Whom</HI> are all things. "For what ha&s;t <HI>thou</HI> which is not receiv|ed? and if received, whereof ha&s;t thou to <HI>glory?</HI> The Glory belongs to Him who has given to <HI>thee,</HI> that <HI>thou</HI> may'&s;t give to others. As, &s;uppo&s;e a rich and charitable Per&s;on puts into my Hand a <HI>Sum</HI> or Sums of Money to di&s;tribute unto others in Want; it is <HI>his</HI> Gift and Bounty, and not mine; and <HI>I</HI> ought to be thankful to Him to|gether with tho&s;e to whom I di&s;tribute. In like man|ner if GOD give <HI>You</HI> Ability and a Heart to do good to others, you owe the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Thanks to God, and &s;hou'd be ready to &s;ay with the <HI>Church, "Not unto us, O Lord, not to us, but to thy Name be Glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You,</HI> my <HI>Brethren!</HI> that are honoured of God to <HI>give</HI> unto the poor, might have been your &s;elves, and &s;o your Families, among the <HI>indigent</HI> and nece&s;&s;itous!

<P><PB N="13" REF="004352_0015_100441C986FF2EF8">
Or yet <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> You might have been among the nig|gardly and <HI>covetous</HI> in the mid&s;t of Riches; not able to <HI>eat</HI> of your own Bread, and le&s;s to give unto others! An <HI>Evil</HI> too often &s;een and felt, a Mi&s;ery too common under the <HI>Sun,</HI> which yet &s;hines liberally on the niggard Soul.</P>
<P>Or &s;till wor&s;e, You might have been among the <HI>frau|dulent and unju&s;t,</HI> the Cheat, the Theif and the Robber; or (which is little better) the Gripe and the Extortioner, the Spoiler of the Widow, the motherle&s;s and fatherle&s;s! But who has made you to <HI>differ?</HI> made Thee a <HI>Bene|factor</HI> and Ble&s;&s;ing to the World, among the&s;e Plagues and Cur&s;es in it? GOD, who is rich in Mercy, and <HI>So|vereign</HI> in his Gifts and Grace to Men, <HI>He</HI> has done it! "Who has Mercy becau&s;e he <HI>will</HI> have Mercy. He that made <HI>Abel Cain</HI>'s Brother, and gave to <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> their <HI>Grandeur</HI> of Heart.</P>
<P>Let <HI>free Grace</HI> therefore have all the Glory; as the Apo&s;tle teaches us, Ephe&s;. 3.18. <HI>To me, who am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints is this Grace given.</HI> So <HI>thou</HI> <Q>by the <HI>Grace</HI> of God art what thou art, and his Grace given thee has not been <HI>in vain!</HI> And if you <HI>labour</HI> more than others, yet not <HI>you,</HI> but the Grace of God in You.</Q>&mdash;So when <HI>David</HI> had done a <HI>kingly</HI> part, and his <HI>Princes</HI> a very <HI>princely</HI> one, in way of Offer|ings out of their E&s;tates; then <HI>David</HI> &s;aid before the Lord, 1 Chron. xxix. 14. <Q><HI>But who am I O Lord God, and what is my People, that we &s;hould be able to offer &s;o willingly after this &s;ort! for all things come of Thee and of thy own have we given thee.</HI></Q>&mdash; Thus they that <HI>receive the Gift,</HI> &s;hould give <HI>Thanks</HI> for it.</P>

<P>Therefore we mu&s;t give equal Glory to the HOLY GHOST, yielding our Selves to <HI>Him,</HI> as the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Sanctifier, proceeding from the Father and the Son!
