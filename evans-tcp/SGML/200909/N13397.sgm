<HEAD>THE CRISIS EXTRAORDINARY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;it down and think &s;eriou&s;ly on the af|fairs of America, but the original principles on which &s;he re&s;i&s;ted, and the glow and ardor they in&s;pired, will occur like the undefaced remembrance of a lovely &s;cene. To trace over in imagination the purity of the cau&s;e, the volun|tary &s;acrifices made to &s;upport it, and all the various turnings of the war <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> its defence, is at once both paying and receiving re&s;pect. The principles de&s;erve to be remembered, and to re|member them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ghtly is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">. In this indulgence of generous recollection we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> by what we &s;eem to give, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> we become,</P>
<P>So exten&s;ively right was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> which America pro|ceeded, that it not only took in every <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and liberal &s;enti|ment which could impre&s;s the heart, but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> intere&s;t of every cla&s;s and order of men to defend the country. The war, on the part of Britain, was originally a war of co|vetou&s;ne&s;s. The &s;ordid and not the &s;plendid pa&s;&s;ions gave it being. The fertile fields and pro&s;perous infancy of America appeared to her as mines for tributary wealth. She viewed the hive, and di&s;regarding the indu&s;try that had enriched it, thir&s;ted for the honey. But in the pre&s;ent &s;tage of her affairs, the violence of temper is added to the rage of avarice; and therefore, that which, at our fir&s;t &s;etting out, proceeded from purity of principle and public intere&s;t, is now heightened by all the obligations of nece&s;&s;ity; for it requires but little know|ledge of human nature to di&s;cern what would be the con&s;e|quence, were America again reduced to the &s;ubjection of Bri|tain. Uncontrouled power, in the hands of an incen&s;ed, im|perious and apacious conqueror, is an engine of dreadful exe|cution&punc; and woe be to that country over which it can be ex|erci&s;ed. The names of Whig and Tory would them be &s;unk in the general term of Rebel, and the oppre&s;&s;ion, whatever it might be, would, with very few in&s;tances of exception, light equally on all.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="016919_0002_0F9EC8B8CC41C1A0">Britain did not go to war with America for the &s;ake of domi|nion, becau&s;e &s;he was then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; neither was it for the exten&s;ion of trade and commerce, becau&s;e &s;he had monopolized the whole and the country had yielded to it; neither was it to extingui&s;h what <HI>&s;he</HI> might call rebellion, becau&s;e before &s;he began no re&s;i&s;tence exi&s;ted.

to pay the intere&s;t of the national debt contracted by former wars, and the remaining &s;um of &s;ix millions &s;ix hundred and forty two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred pounds was applied to defray the yearly expence of government, the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army and navy, placemen pen&s;ioners, &amp;c. con&s;equently the whole of her enormous taxes being thus appropriated, &s;he had nothing to &s;pare out of them towards defraying the ex|pences of the pre&s;ent war or any other. Yet had &s;he not been in debt at the beginning of the war at we were not, and like us had only a land and not a naval war to carry on, her then revenue of eleven millions and a half pounds &s;terling would defray all her annual expences of war and government within each year.</P>
<P>But this not being the ca&s;e with her, &s;he is obliged to bor|row about ten million pounds &s;terling yearly, to pro&s;ecute the war &s;he is now engaged in (this year &s;he borrowed twelve) and lay on new taxes to di&s;charge the intere&s;t; and allowing that the pre&s;ent war has co&s;t her only fifty millions &s;terling, the intere&s;t thereon at five per cent. will be two millions and an half, therefore the amount of her taxes now mu&s;t be fourteen millions, which on an average is no le&s;s than forty &s;hil|lings &s;terling per head, men, women and children through|out

the nation. Now as this expence of fifty millions was borrowed on the hopes of conquering America, and as it was avarice which fir&s;t induced her to commence the war, how truly wretched and deplorable would the condition of this country be, were &s;he, by own remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, to &s;uffer an enemy of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;o circum&s;tanced, to reduce her to &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the revenues of America.</P>
<P>I have already &s;tated the number of &s;ouls in America to be three millions, and by a calculation I have made, which I have every rea&s;on to believe is &s;ufficiently right, the whole ex|pence of the war, and the &s;upport of the &s;everal governments, may be defrayed for two million pounds &s;terling, annually; which, on an average, is thirteen &s;hillings and four pence per head, men, women and children, and the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment at the end of the war will be but three quarters of a million, or five &s;hillings &s;terling per head. Now throwing out of the que&s;tion every thing of honor, principle, happine&s;s, freedom, and reputation in the world, and taking it up on the &s;imple ground of intere&s;t, I put the following ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e Britain was to conquer America, and as conquer|ors was to lay her under no other conditions than to pay the &s;ame proportions toward her annual revenue which the people of England pay; our &s;hare, in that ca&s;e, would be &s;ix mil|lion pounds &s;terling yearly; can it then be a que&s;tion, whe|ther it is be&s;t to rai&s;e two millions to defend the country, and govern it our&s;elves, and only three quarters of a million af|terwards, or pay &s;ix millions to have it conquered, and let the enemy govern it.</P>
<P>Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that conquerors would chu&s;e to put them|&s;elves in a wor&s;e condition than what they granted to the con|quered. In England, the tax on rum is five &s;hillings and one penny &s;terling per gallon, which is one &s;ilver dollar and four|teen coppers. Now would it not be laughable to imagine, that after the expence they have been at, they would let either Whig or Tory in America drink it cheaper than them&s;elves. Coffee which is &s;o con&s;iderable an article of con&s;umption and &s;upport here is there loaded with a duty, which makes the price between five and &s;ix &s;hillings &s;terling a pound, and a penalty of fifty pounds &s;terling on any per&s;on detected in roa&s;ting it in his own hou&s;e. There is &s;carce an article of life you can eat, drink, wear, or enjoy that is not there loaded with a tax; even the light from heaven is only permitted to &s;hine into their dwellings by paying eighteen pence &s;terling per window annually; and the humble&s;t drink of life, &s;mall beer, can|not there be purcha&s;ed without a tax of nearly two coppers
<PB N="5" REF="016919_0005_0F9EC8BC510AD6B8">
a gallon, be&s;ides a heavy tax upon the malt, and another on the hops before it is brewed, exclu&s;ive of a land tax on the earth which produces them. In &s;hort, the condition of that country in point of taxation is &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive, the number of her poor &s;o great, and the extravagance and rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of the court &s;o enormous, that were they to effect a conque&s;t of America, it is then only that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of America would begin. Neither would it &s;ignify any thing to a man whether he be what we call a Whig or a Tory. The people of Eng|land and the mini&s;try of that country know us by no &s;uch di&s;tinctions. What they want is clear &s;olid revenue, and the modes they would take to procure it, would operate alike on all. Their manner of rea&s;oning would be &s;hort, becau&s;e they would naturally infer that if we were able to carry on a war of five or &s;ix years again&s;t them, we are able to pay the &s;ame taxes which they do.</P>
<P>I have already &s;tated that the expence of conducting the pre&s;ent war, and the government of the &s;everal &s;tates, may be done for two millions &s;terling, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment in time of peace, for three quarters of a million <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have made the calculations in &s;terling, becau&s;e it is a rate generally known in all the &s;tates, and becau&s;e likewi&s;e it admits of an ea&s;y compari&s;on between our expen|ces to &s;upport the war and tho&s;e of the enemy. Four &s;ilver dollars and an half is one pound &s;terling and threepence over.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to navy matters, they flouri&s;h &s;o well, and are &s;o well attended to, in the hands of individuals, that I think it con|&s;i&s;tent on every principle of real u&s;e and oeconomy, to turn the navy into hard money (keeping only three or four pack|et&punc;) and apply it to promote the &s;ervice of the army. We &s;hall not have a &s;hip the le&s;s; the u&s;e of them, and the benefit from them, will be greatly increa&s;ed, and their expences &s;aved. We are now allied with a formidable naval power, from whom we derive the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a navy. And the line in which we can pro&s;ecute the war, &s;o as to reduce the common enemy and benefit the alliance mo&s;t effectually, will be by attending clo&s;ely to the land &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I e&s;timate the charge of keeping up and maintaining an ar|my, officering them, and all expences included, &s;ufficient for the defence of the country, to be equal to the expence of forty thou&s;and men at thirty pounds &s;terling per head, which is one million two hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e allow four hundred thou&s;and pounds for Conti|nental expences at home and abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016919_0006_0F9EC8BD6F21DB60">And four hundred thou&s;and pounds for the &s;upport of the &s;everel &s;tate governments, the amount then will be, <TABLE>

<P>I take the proportion of this &s;tate, Penn&s;ylvania, to be an eighth part of the Thirteen United States, the quota then for us to rai&s;e will be two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; two hundred thou&s;and of which will be our &s;hare for the &s;upport and pay of the army and Continental expences at home and abroad, and fifty thou&s;and pounds for the &s;up|port of &s;tate government.</P>
<P>In order to gain an idea of the proportion in which the rai&s;|ing &s;uch a &s;um will fall, I make the following calculation&punc;</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania contains three hundred and &s;eventy five thou|&s;and inhabitants, men, women and children, which is likewi&s;e an eighth part of the whole inhabitants of the United States: therefore two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling to be rai&s;ed among three hundred and &s;eventy five thou&s;and per&s;ons, is, on an average, thirteen &s;hillings and fourpence &s;terling per head per annum, or &s;omething more than one &s;hilling &s;ter|ling per month. And our proportion of three quarters of a million for the government of the country, in time of peace, will be ninety three thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty pounds &s;terling, fifty thou&s;and of which will be for the government expences of the &s;tate, and forty three thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty pounds for Continental expences at home and abroad.</P>
<P>The peace e&s;tabli&s;hment then will, on an average, be five &s;hillings &s;terling per head. Whereas was England now to &s;top, and the war cea&s;e, her peace e&s;tabli&s;hment would continue the &s;ame as it is now, viz. forty &s;hillings per head; therefore was our taxes nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the war as much per head as hers now is, and the difference to be only whether we &s;hould, at the end of the war, pay at the rate of five &s;hillings per head, or forty &s;hillings per head, the ca&s;e needs no think|ing of. But as we can &s;ecurely defend and keep the country for one third le&s;s than what our burthen would be if it was conquered, and &s;upport the governments afterward for an eighth of what Britain would levy on us, and could I find a mi&s;er who&s;e heart never felt the emotion of a &s;park of prin|ciple, even that man, uninfluenced by every love but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="7" REF="016919_0007_0F9EC8BE067F0278">
of money, and capable of no attachment but to his intere&s;t, would, and mu&s;t, from the frugality which governs him con|tribute to the defence of the country, or he cea&s;es to be a mi&s;er and becomes an ideot. But when we take in with it every thing that can ornament mankind; when the line of our in|tere&s;t becomes the line of our happine&s;s; when all that can chear and animate the heart; when &s;en&s;e of honor, fame, character, at home and abroad, are intervoven not only with the &s;ecurity but the increa&s;e of property, there exi&s;ts not a man in America, unle&s;s he be a hired emi&s;&s;ary, who does not &s;ee that his good is connected with keeping up a &s;ufficient de|fence.</P>
<P>I do not imagine that an in&s;tance can be produced in the world, of a country putting her&s;elf to &s;uch an amazing charge to conquer and en&s;lave another as Britain has done. The &s;um is too great for her to think of with any tolerable degree of temper; and when we con&s;ider the burthen &s;he &s;u&s;tains as well as the di&s;po&s;ition &s;he has &s;hewn, it would be the height of folly in us to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he would not reimbur&s;e her&s;elf by the mo&s;t rapid means, had &s;he once more America within her power. With &s;uch an oppre&s;&s;ion of expence, what would an empty conque&s;t be to her! what relief under &s;uch circum|&s;tances could &s;he derive from a victory without a prize? It was money, it was revenue, &s;he fir&s;t went to war for, and no|thing but <HI>that</HI> would &s;atisfy her. It is not the nature of ava|rice to be &s;atisfied with any thing el&s;e. Every pa&s;&s;ion that acts upon mankind has a peculiar mode of operation. Many of them are temporary and fluctuating; they admit of ce&s;&s;a|tion and variety: But avarice is a fixed uniform pa&s;&s;ion. It neither abates of its vigour nor changes its object; and the rea&s;on why it does not is founded in the nature of things, for wealth has not a rival where avarice is a ruling pa&s;&s;ion. One beauty may excel another, and extingui&s;h from the mind of a man the pictured remembrance of a former one: But wealth is the phoenix of avarice, and therefore cannot &s;eek a new ob|ject, becau&s;e there is not another in the world.</P>
<P>I now pa&s;s on to &s;hew the value of the pre&s;ent taxes, and compare them with the annual expence; but this I &s;hall pre|face with a few explanatory remarks.</P>
<P>There are two di&s;tinct things which make the payment of taxes difficult; the one is the large and real value of the &s;um to be paid, and the other is the &s;carcity of the thing in which the payment is to be made; and although the&s;e appear to be one and the &s;ame, they are in &s;everal in&s;tances not only dif|ferent, but the difficulty &s;prings from different cau&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016919_0008_0F9EC8BEC1EBC2A0">Suppo&s;e a tax was to be laid equal to one half of what every man's yearly income is, &s;uch a tax could not be paid becau&s;e the property could not be &s;pared; and on the other hand, &s;up|po&s;e a very trifling tax was laid to be collected in <HI>pearls,</HI> &s;uch a tax likewi&s;e could not be paid, becau&s;e it could not be had. Now any per&s;on may &s;ee that the&s;e are di&s;tinct ca&s;es, and the latter of them is a repre&s;entation of ours.</P>
<P>That the difficulty cannot proceed from the former, that is, from the real value or weight of the tax, is evident at fir&s;t view to any per&s;on who will con&s;ider it.</P>
<P>The amount of the quota of taxes for this &s;tate for the pre|&s;ent year, 1780 (and &s;o in proportion for every other &s;tate) is twenty millions of dollar, which at &s;eventy for one is but &s;ixty four thou&s;and two hundred and eighty pounds three &s;hil|lings &s;terling, and on an average is no more than three &s;hil|lings and five pence &s;terling per head per annum men, wo|men and children, or five pence per head per month. Now here is a clear po&s;itive fact, that cannot be contradicted, and which proves that the difficulty cannot be in the weight of the tax, for in it&s;elf it is a trifle and far from being adequate to our quota of the expence of the war. The quit rents of one penny &s;terling per acre on only one half the &s;tate, come to upwards of fifty thou&s;and pounds, which is almo&s;t as much as all the taxes of the pre&s;ent year, and as tho&s;e quit rents made no part of the taxes then paid, and are now di&s;|continued, the quantity of money drawn for public &s;ervice this year, exclu&s;ive of the militia fines, which I &s;hall take no|tice of in the proce&s;s of this work, is le&s;s than what was paid and payable in any year preceding the revolution, and &s;ince the la&s;t war; what I mean is that the quit rents and taxes ta|ken together came to a larger &s;um then than the pre&s;ent taxes without the quit rents do now.</P>
<P>My intention by the&s;e arguments and calculations is to place the difficulty to the right cau&s;e, and &s;hew that it does not proceed from the weight or worth of the tax, but from the &s;carcity of the medium in which it is paid; and to illu&s;|trate this point &s;till farther, I &s;hall now &s;hew, that if the tax of twenty millions of dollars was of four times the real va|lue it now is or nearly &s;o, which would be about two hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, and would be our full quota, that this &s;um would have been rai&s;ed with more ca&s;e, and le&s;s felt, than the pre&s;ent &s;um of only &s;ixty four thou&s;and two hundred and eighty pounds.</P>
<P>The convenience or inconvenience of paying a tax in mo|ney ari&s;es from the quantity of money that can be &s;pared out of trade.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016919_0009_0F9EC8BF81620CB8">When the emi&s;&s;ions &s;topt, the continent was left in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of two hundred millions of dollars, perhaps as equally di&s;per&s;ed as it was po&s;&s;ible for trade to do it. And as no more was to be i&s;&s;ued, the ri&s;e or fall of prices could neither increa&s;e nor dimini&s;h the quantity. It therefore remained the &s;ame through all the fluctuations of trade and exchange.</P>
<P>Now had the exchange &s;tood at twenty for one, which was the rate congre&s;s calculated upon when they quoted the &s;tates the latter end of la&s;t year, trade would have been carried on for nearly four times le&s;s money than it is now, and con&s;e|quently the twenty millions would have been &s;cared with much greater ea&s;e, and when collected would have been of almo&s;t four times the value they now are. And on the other hand, was the depreciation to be at ninety or one hundred for one, the quantity required for trade would be more than at &s;ixty or &s;eventy for one, and though the value of the tax would be le&s;s, the difficulty of &s;paring the money out of trade would be greater. And on the&s;e facts and arguments I re&s;t the matter, to prove, that it is not the want of property, but the &s;carcity of the medium by which the proportion of property for taxation is to be mea&s;ured out, that makes the embarra&s;&s;ment we lie under. There <HI>is not</HI> money enough, and what is equally as true, the people will not let there be money enough.</P>
<P>While I am on the &s;ubject of the currency, I &s;hall offer one remark which will appear true to every body, and can be ac|counted for by nobody, which is, that the better the times were, the wor&s;e the money grew; and the wor&s;e the times were, the better the money &s;tood. It never depreciated by any advantage obtained by the enemy. The troubles of &s;eventy &s;ix, and the lo&s;s of Philadelphia in &s;eventy &s;even, made no &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion on it, and every one knows that the &s;ur|render of Charle&s;town did not produce the lea&s;t alteration in the rate of exchange, which for long before, and for more than three months after, &s;tood at &s;ixty for one. It &s;eems as if the certainty of its being our own made us carele&s;s of its value, and that the mo&s;t di&s;tant thoughts of lo&s;ing it made us hug it the clo&s;er, like &s;omething we were loth to part with; or that we depreciate it for our pa&s;time, which, when called to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s by the enemy, we leave off to renew again at our lei&s;ure. In &s;hort our good luck &s;eem to break us, and our bad make us whole.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing on from this digre&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall now endeavor to bring into one view the &s;everal parts I have already &s;tated, and form thereon &s;ome propo&s;itions, and conclude.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="016919_0010_0F9EC8C05FBE1170">I have placed before the reader, the average tax per head paid by the people in England; which is &s;orty &s;hillings &s;terling.</P>
<P>And I have &s;hewn the rate on an average per head, which will defray all the expence of the war to us, and &s;upport the &s;everal governments without running the country into debt, which is thirteen &s;hillings and fourpence.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewn what the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment may be conduct|ed for, viz. an eighth part of what it would be, if under the government of Britain.</P>
<P>And I have likewi&s;e &s;hewn what the average per head of the pre&s;ent taxes are, namely, three &s;hillings and five pence &s;terling or five pence per month; and that their whole yearly value in &s;terling is only &s;ixty four thou&s;and two hundred and eighty pounds. Whereas our quota to keep the payments equal with the expences, is two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds. Con&s;equently there is a deficiency of one hundred and eighty five thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty pounds, and the &s;ame proportion of defect, according to the &s;everal quotas, happens in every other &s;tate. And this defect is the cau&s;e why the army has been &s;o indifferently &s;ed, cloathed and paid. It is the cau&s;e, likewi&s;e, of the nervele&s;s &s;tate of the campaign, and the in&s;ecurity of the country. Now if a tax equal to thirteen and fourpence per head will remove all the&s;e difficulties, make people &s;ecure in their homes, leave them to follow the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of their &s;tores and farms unmole&s;ted, and not only keep out, but drive out the enemy from the country; and if the neglect of rai&s;ing this &s;um will let them in, and produce the evils which might be prevented, on which &s;ide, I a&s;k, does the wi&s;dom, intere&s;t and policy lie? Or rather would it not be an in&s;ult to rea&s;on to put the que&s;tion. The &s;um when portioned out according to the &s;everal abilities of the people, can hurt no one, but an inroad from the enemy ruins hun|dreds of families.</P>
<P>Look at the de&s;truction done in this city. The many hou|&s;es totally de&s;troyed, and others damaged; the wa&s;te of &s;en|ces in the country round it, be&s;ides the plunder of furniture, forage and provi&s;ion. I do not &s;uppo&s;e that half a million &s;terling would rein&s;tate the &s;ufferers, and does this, I a&s;k, bear any proportion to the expence that would make us &s;e|cure. The damage on an average is at lea&s;t ten pound &s;ter|ling per head, which is as much as thirteen &s;hillings and fourpence per head comes to for fifteen years. The &s;ame has happened on the frontiers, and in the Jer&s;ies, New York, and other places, where the enemy has been, Carolina and Georgia is likewi&s;e &s;uffering the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="016919_0011_0F9EC8C10A1636E0">That the people generally do not under&s;tand the in&s;uffi|ciency of the taxes to carry on the war, is evident, not only from common ob&s;ervation, but from the con&s;truction of &s;e|veral petitions, which were pre&s;ented to the a&s;&s;embly of this &s;tate, again&s;t the recommendation of congre&s;s of the 18th of March la&s;t, for taking up and funding the pre&s;ent currency at forty for one, and i&s;&s;uing new money in its &s;tead. The prayer of the petitions was, <HI>That the currency might be ap|preciated by taxes</HI> (meaning the pre&s;ent taxes) <HI>and that part of the taxes be applied to the &s;upport of the army, if the army could not be otherwi&s;e &s;upported.</HI> Now it could not have been po&s;&s;i|ble for &s;uch a petition to have been pre&s;ented, had the peti|tioners known, that &s;o far from <HI>part</HI> of the taxes being &s;uf|ficient for the &s;upport of the army, the <HI>whole</HI> of them falls three fourths &s;hort of the year's expences.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to propo&s;e methods by which a &s;ufficiency of money may be rai&s;ed, I &s;hall take a &s;hort review of the general &s;tate of the country.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the weight of the war, the ravages of the enemy, and the ob&s;tructions &s;he has thrown in the way of trade and commerce, &s;o &s;oon does a young country outgrow misfortune, that America has already &s;urmounted many that once heavily oppre&s;&s;ed her. For the fir&s;t year or two of the war, we were &s;hut up within our ports, &s;carce venturing to look towards the ocean. Now our rivers are beautified with large and valuable ve&s;&s;els, our &s;tores filled with merchandize, and the produce of the country has a ready market, and an ad|vantageous price. Gold and &s;ilver, that for a while &s;eemed to have retreated again within the bowels of the earth, is once more ri&s;en into circulation, and every day adds new &s;trength to trade, commerce, and agriculture. In a pamphlet written by Sir John Dalrymple, and di&s;per&s;ed in America in the year 1775, he a&s;&s;erted, that, <HI>two twenty gun &s;hips, nay,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the tenders of tho&s;e &s;hips, &s;tationed between Albermarle &s;ound and Che&s;apeak bay, would &s;hut up the trade of America for</HI> 600 <HI>miles.</HI> How little did Sir John Dalrymple know of the abilities of America!</P>
<P>While under the government of Britain, the trade of this country was loaded with re&s;trictions. It was only a few fo|reign ports &s;he was allowed to &s;ail to. Now it is otherwi&s;e; and allowing that the quantity of trade is but half what it was before the war, the ca&s;e mu&s;t &s;hew the va&s;t advantage of an open trade, becau&s;e the pre&s;ent quantity under her re|&s;trictions could not &s;upport it&s;elf; from which I infer, that if half the quantity without the re&s;trictions can bear it&s;elf up nearly, it not quite, as well as the whole when &s;ubject to them, how pro&s;perous mu&s;t the condition of America be when the whole &s;hall return open with all the world. By trade I
<PB N="12" REF="016919_0012_0F9EC8C1D003E250">
do not mean the employment of a merchant only, but the whole intere&s;t and bu&s;ine&s;s of the country taken collectively.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o much my intention, by this publication, to pro|po&s;e particular plans for rai&s;ing money, as it is to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity and the advantages to be derived from it. My prin|cipal de&s;ign is to form the di&s;po&s;ition of the people to &s;uch mea&s;ures which I am fully per&s;uaded is their intere&s;t and duty to adopt, and which needs no other force to accompli&s;h them than the force of being felt. But as every hint <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, I &s;hall throw out a &s;tretch, and leave others <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> make <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> improvements upon it as to them may appear rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>The annual &s;um wanted is two millions, and the average rate in which it falls is thirteen &s;hillings and fourpence per head.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then that we rai&s;e half the &s;um and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds over. The average rate thereof will be &s;even &s;hil|lings per head.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e we &s;hall have half the &s;upply we want, and an annual fund of &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds whereon to borrow the other million; becau&s;e &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds is the intere&s;t of a million at &s;ix per cent. and if at the end of another year we &s;hould be obliged, by the continuance of the war, to bor|row another million, the taxes will be increa&s;ed to &s;even &s;hil|lings and &s;ixpence; and thus for every million borrowed, an additional tax equal to &s;ixpence per head mu&s;t be levied.</P>
<P>The &s;um then to be rai&s;ed next year will be one million and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds: One half of which I would propo&s;e &s;hould be rai&s;ed by duties on imported goods and prize goods, and the other half by a tax on landed property and hou&s;es, or &s;uch other means as each &s;tate may devi&s;e.</P>
<P>But as the duties on imports and prize goods mu&s;t be the &s;ame in all the &s;tates, therefore the rate per cent. or in what other form the duty &s;hall be laid, mu&s;t be a&s;certained and re|gulated by congre&s;s, and ingrafted in that form into the law of each &s;tate; and the monies ari&s;ing therefrom carried into the trea&s;ury of each &s;tate. The duties to be paid in gold or &s;ilver.</P>
<P>There are many rea&s;ons why a duty on imports is the mo&s;t convenient duty or tax that can be collected, one of which is, becau&s;e the whole is payable in a few places in a country, and it likewi&s;e operates with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and equality, becau&s;e as every one pays in proportion to what he con|&s;umes, the people in general con&s;ume in proportion to what they an afford, and therefore the tax is regulated by the abi|lities
<PB N="13" REF="016919_0013_0F9EC8C29CA7BD38">
which every man &s;uppo&s;es him&s;elf to have, or in other words every man becomes his own a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and pays by a little at a time when it &s;uits him to buy. Be&s;ides, it is a tax which people may pay or let alone by not con&s;uming the articles; and though the alternative may have no influence on their con|duct, the power of choo&s;ing is an agreeable thing to the mind. For my own part, it would be a &s;atisfaction to me, was there a duty on all &s;orts of liquors during the war, as in any idea of things, it would be an addition to the plea&s;ure of &s;ociety, to know, that when the health of the army goes round, a few drops from every gla&s;s become theirs. How often have I heard an emphatical wi&s;h almo&s;t accompanied with a tear, <HI>"Oh, that our poor fellows in the field had &s;ome of this!"</HI> Why then need we &s;uffer under a fruitle&s;s &s;ympathy, when there is a way to enjoy both the wi&s;h and the entertainment at once?</P>
<P>But the great national policy of putting a duty upon imports is, that it either keeps the foreign trade in our own hands or draws &s;omething for the defence of the country from every fo|reigner who participates it with us.</P>
<P>Thus much for the fir&s;t half of the taxes, and as each &s;tate will be&s;t devi&s;e means to rai&s;e the other half, I &s;hall confine my remarks to the re&s;ources of this &s;tate.</P>
<P>The quota then of this &s;tate of one million and &s;ixty thou|&s;and pounds will be one hundred and thirty-three thou&s;and two hundred and fifty pounds, the half of which is &s;ixty-&s;ix thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and twenty-five pounds; and &s;uppo&s;ing one fourth part of Penn&s;ylvania inhabited, then a tax of one bu&s;hel of wheat on every twenty acres of land, one with an|other, would produce the &s;um, and all the pre&s;ent taxes to cea&s;e. Whereas the tythes of the bi&s;hops and clergy in Eng|land, exclu&s;ive of the taxes, are upwards of half a bu&s;hel of wheat on <HI>every &s;ingle</HI> acre of land, good and bad, throughout the nation.</P>
<P>In a former part of this paper I mentioned the militia fines, but re&s;erved &s;peaking to the matter, which I &s;hall now do: The ground I &s;hall put it open is, that two millions &s;terling a year will &s;upport a &s;ufficient army, and all the expences of war, and government, without having recour&s;e to the inconvenient method of continually calling men from their employments, which of all others is the mo&s;t expen&s;ive and the lea&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial. I con&s;ider the revenue created by taxes as the fir&s;t and princi|pal thing, and fines only as &s;econdary and accidental things. It was not the intention of the militia law to apply the mili|tia fines to any thing el&s;e but the &s;upport of the militia, neither do they produce any revenue to the &s;tate, yet the&s;e fines amount to more than all the taxes; for taking the mu&s;ter
<PB N="14" REF="016919_0014_0F9EC8C350D3F7D8">
roll to be &s;ixty thou&s;and men, the fine on forty thou&s;and who may not attend, will be &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, and tho&s;e who mu&s;ter, will give  <GAP DESC="blank">  portion of time equal to half that &s;um, and if the eight cla&s;&s;es &s;hould be called within the year, and one third turn out, the fine on the remaining forty thou&s;and would amount to &s;eventy two millions of dollars, be|&s;ides the fifteen &s;hillings on every hundred pounds property, and the charge of &s;even and a half per cent for collecting in certain in&s;tances, which on the whole would be upwards of two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>Now if tho&s;e very fines di&s;able the country from rai&s;ing a &s;ufficient revenue without producing an equivalent advantage, would it not be to the ea&s;e and intere&s;t of all parties to en|crea&s;e the revenue, in the manner I have propo&s;ed, or any better, if a better can be devi&s;ed, and cea&s;e the operation of the fines. I would &s;till keep the militia as an organized body of men, and &s;hould there be a real nece&s;&s;ity to call them forth, pay them out of the proper revenues of the &s;tate, and encrea&s;e the taxes a third or fourth per cent. on tho&s;e who did not attend. My limits will not allow me to go farther into this matter, which I &s;hall therefore clo&s;e with this re|mark; that fines are, of all modes of revenue, the mo&s;t un|&s;uited to the mind of a free country. When a man pays a tax, he knows the public nece&s;&s;ity requires it, and therefore feels a pride in di&s;charging his duty; but a fine &s;eems an at|tonement for neglect of duty, and of con&s;equence is paid with di&s;credit, and frequently levied with &s;everity.</P>
<P>I have now only one &s;ubject more to &s;peak to, with which I &s;hall conclude, which is, the re&s;olve of congre&s;s of the 18th of March la&s;t, for taking up and funding the pre&s;ent curren|cy at forty for one, and i&s;&s;uing new money in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>Every one knows I am not the flatterer of congre&s;s, but in this in&s;tance <HI>they are right;</HI> and if that mea&s;ure is &s;upported, the currency will acquire a value, which without it, it will not. But this it not all: It will give relief to the finances until &s;uch time as they can be properly arranged, and &s;ave the country from being immediately double taxed under the pre&s;ent mode. In &s;hort, &s;upport that mea&s;ure, and it will &s;upport you.</P>
<P>I have now waded through a tedious cour&s;e of difficult bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and over an untrodden path. The &s;ubject on every point it could be viewed was entangled with perplexities, and inveloped in ob&s;curity, yet &s;uch are the re&s;ources of America, that &s;he wants nothing but &s;y&s;tem to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P><PB N="15" REF="016919_0015_0F9EC8C408C76020">P. S. While this paper was preparing for the pre&s;s, the treachery of General Arnold became known, and en|gro&s;&s;ed the attention and conver&s;ation of the public; and that, not &s;o much on account of the traitor as the magnitude of the trea&s;on, and the providence evident in the di&s;covery. The matter, as far as is at pre&s;ent known, is thus briefly re|lated.</P>
<P>General Arnold about &s;ix weeks before had obtained the command of the important po&s;t of We&s;t Point, &s;ituated on the North river, about &s;ixty miles above New York, and an hundred below Albany, there being no other defenceable pa&s;s between it and the la&s;t mentioned place. At what time, or in what manner, he fir&s;t entered into a negociation with the enemy for betraying the fort and garri&s;on into their hands, does not yet appear.</P>
<P>While Arnold commanded at We&s;t Point, General Wa&s;h|ington and the mini&s;ter of France went to Hartford in Con|necticut, to con&s;ult on matters, in concert with Admiral Terney commander of the French fleet &s;tationed at Rhode I&s;land. In the mean time Arnold held a conference with Major Andre, Adjutant General to General Clinton, whom he traiterou&s;ly furni&s;hed with plans of the fort, &s;tate of the garri&s;on, minutes of the la&s;t council of war, and the man|ner in which he would po&s;t the troops when the enemy &s;hould attempt a &s;urpri&s;e; and then gave him a pa&s;s, by the name of Mr. John Ander&s;on, to go to the lines at the White Plains or lower, if he Mr. Ander&s;on thought proper, he being (the pa&s;s &s;aid) on public bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus furni&s;hed, Andre parted from Arnold, &s;et off for New York, and had nearly arrived at the extent of our lines, when he was &s;topped by a party of militia, to whom he pro|duced his pa&s;s, but they, not being &s;atisfied with his account, in&s;i&s;ted on taking him before the commanding officer Lieut. Col. Jamie&s;on. Finding him&s;elf in this &s;ituation, and hoping to e&s;cape by a bribe, he offered them his pur&s;e, watch and a pro|mi&s;e of any quantity of goods they would accept, which the&s;e hone&s;t men nobly and virtuou&s;ly &s;corned, and con&s;i&s;tent with their duty took him to the proper officer. On exami|nation there was found on him the above mentioned papers and &s;everal others, all in the hand writing of General Arnold, and finding him&s;elf thus detected, he confe&s;&s;ed his proper name and character; he was accordingly made a clo&s;e pri|&s;oner, and the papers &s;ent off by expre&s;s to We&s;t Point, at which place General Wa&s;hington had arrived &s;oon after the arrival of the packet. On this di&s;clo&s;ure, he went in que&s;t of Arnold, whom he had not &s;een that day, but all that could be learned was, that Arnold had received a letter &s;ome &s;hort time before, which had much confu&s;ed him, &s;ince which he had di&s;appeared. Colonel Hamilton, one of General Wa&s;h|ington's aids, with &s;ome others were &s;ent after him, but he
<PB N="16" REF="016919_0016_0F9EC8C4D257CD00">
having the &s;tart eluded the pur&s;uit, took boat under pretence of a flag, and got on board the Vulture &s;loop of war lying in the North river; on which it may be truly &s;aid, that one vulture was receiving another. From on board this ve&s;&s;el he addre&s;&s;ed a letter to General Wa&s;hington, which, in what|ever light it may be viewed, confirms him a fini&s;hed villain.</P>
<P>The true character of Arnold is that of a de&s;perado. His whole life has been a life of jobbs; and where either plunder or profit was the object, no danger deterred, no principle re|&s;trained him. In his per&s;on he was &s;mart and active, &s;ome|what diminutive, weak in his capacities and trifling in his conver&s;ation; and though gallant in the field, was defective in the talents nece&s;&s;ary for command. The early convul&s;ion of the times afforded him an introduction into life, to the ele|gance of which he was before a &s;tranger, and the eagerne&s;s of the public, to reward and encourage enterprize, procured him at once both applau&s;e and promotion. His march to Quebec gave him fame, and the plunder of Montreal put the fir&s;t &s;tamp to his public character. His behaviour at Danbury and Saratoga once more covered over his crimes, which again broke forth in the plunder of Phila|delphia, under pretence of &s;upplying the army. From this time, the true &s;pring of his conduct being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> he became both di&s;regarded and di&s;e&s;teemed, and this la&s;t in&s;tance of his treachery has proved the public judgment right.</P>
<P>When we take a review of the hi&s;tory of former times, it will turn out to the honor of America, that, notwith&s;tanding the trying variety of her &s;ituation, this is the only in&s;tance of defection in a general officer; and even in this ca&s;e the un|&s;haken hone&s;ty of tho&s;e who detected him heightens the na|tional character, to which his apo&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;erves as a foil. From the nature of his crime, and his di&s;po&s;ition to monopolize, it is rea&s;onable to conclude he had few or no <HI>direct</HI> accomplices. His &s;ole object was to make a monied bargain; and to be con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, he would as readily betray the &s;ide he has de&s;erted to, as that he de&s;erted from.</P>
<P>But there is one reflection re&s;ults from this black bu&s;ine&s;s, that de&s;erves notice, which is, that it &s;hows the declining power of the enemy. An attempt to bribe is a &s;acrifice of military fame, and a confe&s;&s;ion of inability to conquer; as a proud people they ought to be above it, and as &s;oldiers to de&s;pi&s;e it; and however they may feel on the occa&s;ion, the world at large will de&s;pi&s;e them for it, and con&s;ider America &s;uperior to their arms.</P>
