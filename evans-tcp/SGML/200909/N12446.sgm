<P>I SHALL make no apology for writing this pamphlet; &s;ure I am it was meant for your good: Be&s;ides, this is not the fir&s;t time I have mov|ed my quill in your behalf. Many times have I hazarded my life for you, as well as for my own property; and if occa&s;ion &s;hall in future require, will freely do it again.</P>
<P>ON my return from a barbarous captivity, (part of which extraordinary &s;ufferings was for your &s;akes) to <HI>Bennington,</HI> the latter end of May, 1778, and having received the congratulations of a large circle of friends, and returned them the mutual ex|change of compliment and friend&s;hip, and had agree|ably entertained our&s;elves in commemorating the &s;urprizing &s;ucce&s;s of the la&s;t campaign; &mdash;the down|fall of a whole Briti&s;h army, with a BURGOYNE at their head: And after moving the flowing bowl, expatiated on the ever-memorable battle and victory of <HI>Bennington,</HI> the forerunner and grand typical fi|gure of the de&s;truction of the Northern army; we then took a retro&s;pective view of our old <HI>New-York</HI> quarrel, and entered into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the politi|cal
<PB N="4" REF="015719_0003_0F99DFB5A3C4E028">
events of forming the new State of VERMONT, it then appeared to me to be a very political move|ment. I have &s;ince, upon mature deliberation, ex|patiated on the good effects which cannot fail of re|dounding to the inhabitants, in &s;o exten&s;ive a fron|tier country, from the ble&s;&s;ings of a well e&s;tabli&s;hed civil government; and think it worth my trouble to communicate my &s;entiments and reflections to the public, with a view of encouraging the good and virtuous inhabitants of this State, to per&s;evere and be happy in the further confirming and e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;ame.</P>
<P>TO live in a &s;tate of anarchy, has been found to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom and practice of mankind in all ages and nations, particularly the civilized; and &s;avage tribes have certain maxims, cu&s;toms or traditions, which are &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of written laws. Indeed, the &s;tate and condition of men urgeth, nay, nece&s;&s;itates them to adopt &s;ome form of government for their mutual protection and defence: And, ina&s;much as a long cour&s;e of expe|rience has, or in truth may convince every capable judge in the &s;aid &s;tate of <HI>Vermont,</HI> that the govern|ment of <HI>New-York</HI> never de&s;ired to exerci&s;e juri&s;dic|tional authority over the inhabitants of &s;aid &s;tate, for any other purpo&s;e but to oppre&s;s and deprive them of their lands and labours; therefore, it is our duty and intere&s;t to yield them no &s;ubjection. Sure|ly, it was not becau&s;e they loved us or we them; for, the hatred &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us, is equivalent to that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the Independent States of <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Every overture of
<PB N="5" REF="015719_0004_0F99DFB663BD8558">
pretended peace and friend&s;hip to us, is big with mi&s;chief and &s;ecret de&s;ign to entrap and en&s;nare the unwary among us, to divide us, and overturn our new government. This may be learnt from their late proclamation, as well as from many other ways and arts u&s;ed particularly in the &s;outh-ea&s;t corner of <HI>Cumberland</HI> county, where there are many Tories, who, to a man, through the whole &s;tate, are u&s;ing their influence and intrigues again&s;t our new &s;tate, in favour of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> which, for certain motives they prefer.</P>
<P>BUT, to take a retro&s;pective view of the conduct of that government towards us, from four to &s;ix, or &s;even years ago, and we &s;hall find that the <HI>New York</HI> patentees got judgment again&s;t tho&s;e under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> at trials at common law; but the claim|ants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> appealed to club law, and, in this mode of trial, they beat the claimants under <HI>New-York;</HI> and, in tho&s;e days, a &s;ort of mob go|vernment, in the now county of <HI>Bennington</HI> took place, which, however deficient in mo&s;t re&s;pects, was neverthele&s;s the terror of the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the only means by which we could po&s;&s;ibly maintain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our lands. In the mean the then counties of <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;|ter</HI> were greatly oppre&s;&s;ed by the venality and cor|ruption of the government of <HI>New-York:</HI> This I re|fer to the knowledge of the inhabitants in tho&s;e counties; though it is altogether probable, that pro|vided <HI>New-York</HI> government had conquered the Green Mountain Boys, and monopolized their lands, tho&s;e on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the mountain would have
<PB N="6" REF="015719_0005_0F99DFB74A8B3800">
&s;hared the &s;ame fate. I have only to add, in this place, that in tho&s;e days civil government could not be a&s;&s;umed; but I now rejoice to &s;ee it e&s;tabli&s;hed. This is the happy aera which our worthy and de|cea&s;ed friend, Doctor <HI>Thomas Young,</HI> beautifully ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the inhabitants of the &s;tate of <HI>Ver|mont,</HI> in the&s;e words: <Q>As the &s;upreme Arbiter of right has &s;miled on the ju&s;t cau&s;e of <HI>North-Ame|rica</HI> at large, you in a peculiar manner have been highly favoured; God has done by you the be&s;t thing commonly done for our &s;pecies; he has fairly put it in your power to help your&s;elves.</Q> Our con&s;titution is very much approved of in &s;uch parts of the ea&s;tern &s;tates, where it has been circu|lated; and though it be difficult, nay, impo&s;&s;ible to form a mode of government to the entire &s;atisfac|tion of the whole body politic; yet I am appre|hen&s;ive, that there are as little, I may &s;ay le&s;s di&s;&s;a|tisfaction in the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont,</HI> as to matters of government, as in any of the ea&s;tern &s;tates, <HI>Connecti|cut</HI> excepted. Probably, there are &s;ome in every &s;tate who are aver&s;e to any mode of government at all; and &s;uch, I fear, are out of the reach of argu|ment and rea&s;on; &s;uch are untractable and barba|rous &s;ouls, who enjoy no &s;atisfaction in the happi|ne&s;s of their &s;pecies, or in the effu&s;ion of dome&s;tic peace, order, and &s;ocial virtue: But all good and wi&s;e men, will exert them&s;elves in e&s;tabli&s;hing and &s;upporting good government and order, which are in&s;eparably connected together: And though, in the tumults and confu&s;ions of a cruel war, the pre&s;ent formed con&s;titutions and modes of government may, and undoubtedly are, more or le&s;s imperfect; yet
<PB N="7" REF="015719_0006_0F99DFBB8AAE44A8">
they may, in future, be corrected and amended as time of lei&s;ure, cool deliberation, and experience may dictate.</P>
<P>CERTAIN I am, that our frontier country was un|der the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity of forming into a civil and political government. They were obliged to exer|ci&s;e, not only an internal policy among them&s;elves, but an external policy again&s;t a foreign inva&s;ion. This they could not tru&s;t to <HI>New-York,</HI> who would have been rejoiced to have our inhabitants cut off, that their lands might have fallen into their hands; an object which they have been pur&s;uing for more than &s;even years la&s;t pa&s;t. In this extreme &s;ituation government was formed, and General <HI>Burgoyne</HI> at the &s;ame time advancing into the country. The Council of our new &s;tate was very bu&s;y and zealous in forming the militia into regiments, under brave officers, to face Mr. <HI>Burgoyne:</HI> At the &s;ame time Ge|neral <HI>Schuyler</HI> ordered our militia to march to <HI>Sara|taga;</HI> but the Council would not allow it, as they viewed <HI>Bennington,</HI> and the adjacent country, to be the object of de&s;truction by the enemy, at lea&s;t, if not &s;o, by their old adver&s;aries. The Council, fur|thermore, &s;ent an expre&s;s to the Council of the &s;tate of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> acquainting them of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont,</HI> and imploring their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> generou&s;ly afforded, &s;ending their hero General <HI>Starks,</HI> with a brigade of valiant men, which being joined by the Green Mountain Boys, terminated in the memorable and twice glorious battles and victories of <HI>Bennington.</HI> This proved the &s;alvation of our new &s;tate, and had
<PB N="8" REF="015719_0007_0F99DFBCC3955008">
its &s;alutary influence on the pending cau&s;e of the In|dependent States of <HI>America</HI> at large, and is a &s;trik|ing proof of the good policy of a&s;&s;uming govern|ment.</P>
<P>ANY one who is acquainted with mankind and things, mu&s;t know, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to manage the political matters of this country without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of civil government. A large body of peo|ple de&s;titute of it, is like a &s;hip in the &s;ea without a helm or mariner, to&s;&s;ed by impetuous waves. We could not enjoy dome&s;tic peace and &s;ecurity alone, &s;et a&s;ide the con&s;equences of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> war and <HI>New-York</HI> &s;trife, without civil regulations. The two la&s;t con&s;iderations do, in the mo&s;t &s;triking manner, ex|cite us to &s;trengthen and confirm the government already &s;et up by the authority of the people, which is the fountain of all temporal power, and from which the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont</HI> have alrea|dy received &s;uch &s;ignal advantages. This puts us on an equal footing with our old <HI>New-York</HI> adver|&s;aries, and will enable us to baffle all their &s;chemes; and this the General A&s;&s;embly of the State of <HI>New-York</HI> well knew, when they &s;ent forth their Procla|mation from <HI>Poughkeep&s;ie,</HI> dated the 23d day of <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI> 1778, and &s;igned by his Excellency <HI>George Clinton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor of that &s;tate: Which Pro|clamation I do here in&s;ert, (for the purpo&s;e of in|forming the inhabitants of the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont</HI> of the de&s;igns of the new legi&s;lature of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York</HI>) together with my ob&s;ervations on the &s;ame.</P>

<P>THAT the &s;aid conte&s;t was occa&s;ioned partly by the i&s;&s;uing of divers interfering patents or grants, by the re&s;pective governments of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the one part, and tho&s;e of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> on the other, antecedent to the late e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the ea&s;tern boundary of this &s;tate; part|ly by an higher quit rent re&s;erved on the &s;aid lands, when re-granted under <HI>New-York,</HI> than were re&s;erv|ed in the original grants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> or <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> and the exorbitant fees of office accruing thereon; and partly by a number of grants made by the late government of <HI>New-York</HI> after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;aid ea&s;tern boundary, for lands which had been before granted by the governments

<P>THAT the afore&s;aid di&s;affection has been greatly increa&s;ed, by an act pa&s;&s;ed by the Legi&s;lature of the late colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and &s;eventy-four, entitled, "An Act for pre|venting tumultuous and riotous a&s;&s;emblies in the places therein mentioned, and for the more &s;peedy and effectual puni&s;hing the rioters."

<P>THIS proclamation, after mentioning a di&s;af|fection of many per&s;ons inhabiting the northea&s;t parts of the county of <HI>Albany,</HI> and certain parts of the counties of <HI>Charlotte, Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> proceeds to affirm that the&s;e tracts of country were clearly included within the antient, original, true and lately e&s;tabli&s;hed bounds of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>THAT many, nay almo&s;t the whole of the inhabi|tants in tho&s;e counties, <HI>alias,</HI> the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont,</HI> are di&s;affected to the government of <HI>New-York,</HI> will not be di&s;puted. This is a fact: But it is not fact, that the ancient, original and true bounds of <HI>New-York</HI> included tho&s;e lands. The fir&s;t intimation that ever &s;aluted the ears of the public, a&s;&s;erting this doctrine, was, from a proclamation of Governor <HI>Tryon</HI>'s, dat|ed the 11th day of December, 1771, which begins thus: <Q>Whereas, it is the ancient and inconte&s;ti|ble
<PB N="16" REF="015719_0015_0F99DFC5F3F79AA8">
right of this colony, to extend to <HI>Connecticut</HI> River as its ea&s;tern boundary.</Q> This a&s;&s;ertion hath been an&s;wered at large in my Treati&s;e on the Conduct of this Government towards the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers, to which I refer the reader, and at pre&s;ent ob&s;erve, that as the quoted a&s;&s;ertions in the&s;e proclamations, are wholly without foundation, they need only to be as po&s;itively denied as they are a&s;&s;erted. The fact is, that the tract of land which now comprehends the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont,</HI> was univer&s;ally known to be in the government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> Thus it was placed by all Geographers in their maps, 'till the year 1764, when the now <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King, for certain political rea&s;ons, which I &s;hall mention, extended the juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York</HI> over the premi&s;es, by his &s;pecial royal authority. At the time of the alteration of this juri&s;diction, jea|lou&s;ies had fir'd the minds of King and Parliament again&s;t the growth and ri&s;ing power of <HI>America,</HI> and at this time they began to advance men and govern|ments into power, with a political de&s;ign to cru&s;h the liberties of <HI>America. New-York</HI> had ever been their favourite government: They could almo&s;t vie with <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in the art of va&s;&s;alaging common people, and in era&s;ing every idea of liberty from the human mind, by making and keeping them poor and &s;ervile. This <HI>Great-Britain</HI> well knew; and therefore &s;liced a large territory from <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and added it to <HI>New York,</HI> to depre&s;s the power of the one, and enlarge and extend the other. A well concerted plan: But the Green Mountain Boys di&s;concerted it, by throwing their weight in to the
<PB N="17" REF="015719_0016_0F99DFC729E791D0">
&s;cale of Congre&s;s, which, thank God, has fairly ponderated. Thus may be &s;een the de&s;ign, as well as date, of the original, ancient and true bounds of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York</HI>'s being extended over the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont;</HI> and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on it was thus ex|tended by <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> it will undoubtedly be cur|tailed by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>AS to the acts of outlawry, mentioned in the Pro|clamation, they died a natural death the fir&s;t day of January, 1776, as may be &s;een from the act it&s;elf, here quoted:
<Q>And be it further enacted by the authority afore&s;aid, that this act &s;hall remain and continue in full force and effect, from the pa&s;&s;ing thereof, until the fir&s;t day of January, which will be in the year of our Lord, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix.</Q></P>
<P>THE &s;ubjects of the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont</HI> were under no apprehen&s;ions from the&s;e old, lifele&s;s acts: Nor do I conceive, that the pre&s;ent Legi&s;lature of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York</HI> have laid them under any obliga|tion, in granting them a pardon. It was a matter which formerly re&s;pected Governor <HI>Tryon,</HI> the old Legi&s;lature of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the Green Mountain Boys; and the party la&s;t mentioned, choo&s;e to &s;ettle that old quarrel with Mr. <HI>Tryon,</HI> and re&s;ent it, that the Legi&s;lature of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York</HI> have, &s;o late in the day, undertook to give an <Q>Unconditional di&s;charge and remi&s;&s;ion of all penalties and for|feitures incurred,</Q> under an act, which had been long dead; and which, when alive, &s;erved only to di&s;cover to the world, the wickedne&s;s and depravi|ty
<PB N="18" REF="015719_0017_0F99DFC89BCF6280">
of that legi&s;lative body which enacted them. In the lifetime of this act, I was called by the <HI>Yorkers</HI> an outlaw, and afterwards by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> was called a rebel; and I humbly conceive, that there was as much propriety in the one name as the other, and I verily believe, that the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners would now be as willing to pardon me for the &s;in of rebel|lion, provided I would afterwards be &s;ubject to <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> as the Legi&s;lature abovementioned, provided I would be a &s;ubject to <HI>New-York;</HI> and, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, I had as leave be a &s;ubject to the one as the other, and, it is well known, I have had great ex|perience with them both.</P>
<P>NEXT, I propo&s;e to con&s;ider that part of the pro|clamation called Overtures, which are contained in the three fir&s;t articles. Article 1&s;t. <Q>That all per|&s;ons actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and improving lands, by title under grants from <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> and not granted under <HI>New-York,</HI> &s;hall be confirmed in their re&s;pective po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>THIS fir&s;t article cannot be con&s;idered of any ma|terial con&s;equence, inasmuch, as among almo&s;t the whole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions referred to in the article, there are but very few, if any, but what are covered with <HI>New-York</HI> grants.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd article is as follows: <Q>That all per|&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and improving lands, not granted by either of the three governments, &s;hall be con|firmed in their re&s;pective po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, together with &s;uch additional quantity of vacant land, ly|ing
<PB N="19" REF="015719_0018_0F99DFC8AF0907E8">
contiguous to each re&s;pective po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as may be nece&s;&s;ary to form the &s;ame into a conve|nient farm, &s;o as the quantity of land to be con|firmed to each re&s;pective po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hall not ex|ceed three hundred acres.</Q></P>
<P>NEITHER of the&s;e two fir&s;t articles, called Over|tures, affect the controver&s;y, except in &s;ome very few in&s;tances, inasmuch as all, or in a manner all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;poken of, were fir&s;t granted by <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> except &s;ome few which were granted by <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay;</HI> and then, la&s;tly, almo&s;t the whole of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions regranted by <HI>New-York.</HI> This being the ca&s;e, what has been hitherto propo&s;ed, does not reach the e&s;&s;ence of the controver&s;y, as the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> very well know; be&s;ides, it is not in the power of the government to confirm any of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which have been already granted, and therefore become the property of the grantees, as will be more fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in its proper place. I proceed to the third article of the much boa&s;ted O|vertures.</P>
<P><Q>THAT where lands have been heretofore grant|ed by <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> or ei|ther of them, and actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence thereof, and being &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, were afterwards granted by <HI>New-York,</HI> &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hall be con|firmed, the po&s;terior grant under <HI>New-York</HI> not|with&s;tanding.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH it is ab&s;olutely out of the power of the &s;aid legi&s;lative authority, to confirm the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
<PB N="20" REF="015719_0019_0F99DFC93499C648">
mentioned; yet, to di&s;cover their want of genero&s;i|ty in their propo&s;al, I &s;hall, in the fir&s;t place, con&s;i|der what a trifling proportion of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions could be confirmed upon their own &s;tating, inas|much, as the confirming clau&s;e in the article, only confirms the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, who being &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the time that the <HI>New-York</HI> grant was laid, and has no re&s;pect to any additional po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion carried on after the grant took place: The identical words are, <Q>And being &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, were afterwards granted by <HI>New-York;</HI></Q> <HI>viz.</HI> After &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was ac|tually made, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or being &s;o in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, at the time the grant took place, &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hall be confirmed, but any later po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion cannot be included in the condition of "being &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed;" for, a later po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at all at the time the condition of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion took place; and con|&s;equently, every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which has been begun in the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont,</HI> &s;ince the lands were granted by <HI>New-York,</HI> mu&s;t be lo&s;t to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and fall into the hands of the <HI>New-York</HI> grantees, with all other uncultivated lands in the &s;tate; and all our pur|cha&s;es of tho&s;e lands from <HI>New Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> fall to the ground, together with our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which have been increa&s;ed an hundred fold.</P>
<P>THESE Overtures have hitherto been con&s;idered only in a grammatical and logical &s;en&s;e, allowing them their own con&s;truction; I now proceed to con|&s;ider them in a law &s;en&s;e. A legi&s;lative authority, within its own juri&s;diction, may confirm a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion on vacant land, by making a grant of the &s;ame to
<PB N="21" REF="015719_0020_0F99DFC9EC878558">
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: But, for the legi&s;lative authority of the &s;tate of <HI>New York,</HI> to pretend as they do in their proclamation, to vacate any grants made by their own authority, in favour of any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to confirm &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, by nullifying and defeating their own grants, is the height of folly and &s;tupidi|ty: For, the lands being once granted, the proper|ty pa&s;&s;eth to the grantee, who is become the &s;ole proprietor of the &s;ame; and he is as independent of that legi&s;lative authority which granted it, as any per&s;on may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, who purcha&s;eth a farm of land of me by deed of conveyance; and it is as much out of the power of that legi&s;lature to vacate a grant made by them, or the &s;ame authori|ty, in favour of any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as it is out of my power to vacate my deed of conveyance in favour of &s;ome &s;econd per&s;on. It is contrary to common &s;en&s;e, to &s;uppo&s;e, that the property of the &s;ubject is at the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of the Legi&s;lature: If it was, they might give a grant to-day, and vacate it to-morrow, and &s;o on, <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> This would de|&s;troy the very nature and exi&s;tance of per&s;onal pro|perty, as the whole would depend on the &s;overeign will and la&s;t act of the Legi&s;lature: But the truth of the matter is, the fir&s;t conveyance will, and ought to hold good; and this defeats all &s;ub&s;equent con|veyances.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, it ap|pears, that the Overtures in the Proclamation &s;et forth, are either romantic, or calculated to deceive woods people, who, in general, may not be &s;uppo&s;|ed to under&s;tand law, or the power of a legi&s;lative authority.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="015719_0021_0F99DFCAD1E82AE0">I HAVE further to evince my arguments on this &s;ubject, by the concurring opinion of the Lords of the Board of Trade, on complaint made to them from tho&s;e very per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the lands we are &s;peak|ing of. That clau&s;e of their report which is &s;imi|lar to what I have argued, is in the&s;e words: <Q>Such &s;ub&s;equent grants made by the government of <HI>New York,</HI> however unwarrantable, cannot be &s;et a&s;ide by any authority from his Maje&s;ty, in ca&s;e the grantees &s;hall in&s;i&s;t on their title.</Q></P>
<P>THUS it appears, in a trial (of the &s;ame ca&s;e we are treating of) before the Board of Trade, that the King, under who&s;e authority the government of <HI>New-York</HI> had, in an oppre&s;&s;ive manner granted tho&s;e very lands, could not, by his royal authority, vacate or &s;et a&s;ide the grants; yet the pre&s;ent legi&s;lative authority of the &s;tate of <HI>New-York,</HI> proclaim to the world, and pledge the faith of government, that they will do it: But enough has been &s;aid on the impo&s;&s;ibility of it, as well as on the ungenerou&s;ne&s;s of the propo&s;al: And as to the quit-rents, the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly of the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont</HI> will determine their expediency, and probably relea&s;e them all.</P>
<P>WHAT has been ob&s;erved, an&s;wers every part of the Proclamation worth notice, as the five la&s;t arti|cles had an entire reference to the three fir&s;t; though, it may be worth ob&s;erving, that the time of compli|ance with tho&s;e Overtures are run out, and, it is my opinion, that but few of the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate of <HI>Vermont</HI> have clo&s;ed with them. The main induce|ment
<PB N="23" REF="015719_0022_0F99DFCB8DA170E0">
I had in an&s;wering them was, to draw a full and convincing proof from the &s;ame, that the &s;hort|e&s;t, be&s;t, and mo&s;t eligible, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, the on|ly po&s;&s;ible way of vacating tho&s;e <HI>New-York</HI> interfer|ing grants, is, to maintain inviolable the &s;upremacy of the legi&s;lative authority of the independent &s;tate of <HI>Vermont:</HI> This, at one &s;troke, overturns every <HI>New-York</HI> &s;cheme which may be calculated for our ruin, makes us free men, confirms our property, "and puts it fairly in our power to help our&s;elves," in the enjoyment of the great ble&s;&s;ings of a free, un|corrupted and virtuous civil government. You have fought, bled, and hitherto conquered, and are as de|&s;erving the&s;e good fruits of your valour, hazard and toil, as any people under heaven.</P>
<P>YOU have experienced every &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;i|on, which the old government of <HI>New-York,</HI> with a <HI>Tryon</HI> at their head, could invent and inflict; and it is manife&s;t, that the new government are minded to follow nearly in their &s;teps. Happy it is for you that you are fitted for the &s;evere&s;t of tryals, you have been wonderfully &s;upported, and carried through thus far in your oppo&s;ition to that government. Formerly you had every thing to fear from it: But now you have little to fear, for your public character is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and your cau&s;e known to be ju&s;t. In your early &s;truggles with that govern|ment you acquired a reputation of bravery; this gave you a reli&s;h for martial glory, and the Briti&s;h inva&s;ion opened an ample field for its di&s;play, and you have gone on conquering and to conquer until

TALL GRENADIERS are di&s;mayed and tremble at your approach.
