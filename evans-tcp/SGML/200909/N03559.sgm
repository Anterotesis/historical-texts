<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> xii. 9. <HI>Luke</HI> vi. 6.</NOTE>, of our LORD'S merci|ful and miraculous <HI>curing</HI> the Man that had a <HI>withered Hand.</HI> It was on the <HI>Sabbath Day,</HI> and in the <HI>Syna|gogue,</HI> where no doubt our Lord had been preaching, and in Confirmation of his Doctrine He wro't this <HI>Miracle.</HI> Works of <HI>Charity</HI> and Mercy
<PB N="2" REF="004353_0004_100441B1997C5678">do very well agree with Acts of <HI>Devotion,</HI> and are a becoming Sabbath Exerci&s;e; &s;uited to the Place and Time and Act of Wor&s;hip when Occa&s;ion offers.</P>
<P>The &s;uper&s;titious <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> thought other|wi&s;e; not that they had the lea&s;t Shadow of a <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> for their Affectation and Pretence of a more &s;trict and pre|ci&s;e <HI>Sanctification</HI> of the Sabbath; but they had fondly imbib'd it as a venerable <HI>Tradition,</HI> which was not to be &s;poken again&s;t on any Account, nor parted with, be|cau&s;e it gave 'em a <HI>Credit</HI> among the People, carrying a Face and <HI>Form</HI> of &s;trict Devotion.</P>
<P>On the contrary our <HI>Lord</HI> declared both in his Doc|trine and Practice this <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Truth;</HI> That to <HI>do good</HI> on the Sabbath-day, as well in Acts of <HI>Mercy</HI> as tho&s;e of Wor&s;hip, was the proper and true Sanctification of it.</P>
<P>For this he was particularly <HI>malign'd</HI> and hated by the hypocritical <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> Elders and <HI>Formali&s;ts</HI> of that Day; and therefore we find 'em in our <HI>Context</HI> watching Him whether he would <HI>heal</HI> this poor Man on the Sab|bath, that they might <HI>accu&s;e</HI> him. V. 2.</P>
<P>In to what Spite and <HI>Villany</HI> will not blind <HI>Super&s;tition,</HI> as well as Profane&s;s, carry Men? the mo&s;t Divine and God-like Works &s;hall be traduc'd, revil'd and per&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Patient</HI>'s Ca&s;e was very piteous: It &s;hould have pleaded with 'em to have carry'd him to Chri&s;t, and be&s;ought Him to have Compa&s;&s;ion on him. But on the contrary they play the <HI>Spies</HI> upon our Lord, that they might accu&s;e him for a <HI>Breaker</HI> of the Sabbath. They doubtle&s;s <HI>hop'd</HI> in their Hearts, that Chri&s;t would not fail to <HI>heal</HI> him, but not from the lea&s;t <HI>Pity</HI> to the mi&s;erable Object before them, nay from a diabolical Spirit of <HI>Re|venge</HI> on Chri&s;t, when he had heal'd him. That which &s;hould have <HI>charm'd</HI> 'em into the highe&s;t Reverence and Love, provok'd their Rage.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004353_0005_100449BDA535BDD8">
To &s;hame 'em out of their Ignorance and Wicked|ne&s;s, or to inform their Judgment and move their Com|pa&s;&s;ion, our Lord bid the Man <HI>&s;tand forth;</HI> and then <HI>rea&s;on'd</HI> the Matter with them: "<HI>Is it lawful,</HI> &s;aid He, <HI>to do good on the Sabbath-days, or to do evil? to &s;ave Life or to kill?&mdash;but they held their Peace.</HI> He put it to their <HI>Con&s;ciences,</HI> but they ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;ted the Light and <HI>Conviction</HI> they felt within them&s;elves; and having nothing to &s;ay <HI>again&s;t</HI> &s;o clear a Truth, they would however &s;ay nothing <HI>for it.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Lord</HI> beheld this with great Grief and Anger; "<HI>He looked round about on 'em with Anger, being grieved for the Hardne&s;s of their Hearts.</HI> Ju&s;tly was he pro|voked at the Sin, yet kindly grieved for the Sinners. They <HI>hated</HI> him for his Goodne&s;s, and he <HI>pitied</HI> them for their horrid Impiety and Hypocrify.</P>
<P>He <HI>look'd</HI>&mdash; his Anger appear'd in his <HI>Face.</HI> His An|ger was very ju&s;t and <HI>holy,</HI> for he was angry at their <HI>Sin.</HI> He was griev'd at their <HI>Hardne&s;s,</HI> to &s;ee 'em ob&s;tinately &s;et again&s;t Conviction. There is nothing &s;hould give us &s;o much <HI>Grief,</HI> as to feel the Hardne&s;s of our <HI>own</HI> Hearts, and to &s;ee that of <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>However, neither their <HI>Prejudice,</HI> and the Offence they took, nor the malicious <HI>U&s;e</HI> they re&s;olved to make of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> curing the poor Man, could <HI>hinder</HI> our Lord from doing it. It was a mo&s;t known Act of Goodne&s;s, and He re&s;olutely did it; as we read in my <HI>Text,&mdash;He &s;aid to the Man, Stretch forth thy Hand! and he &s;tretch|ed it out, and his Hand was re&s;tored whole as the o|ther.</HI></P>
<P>It may &s;eem a <HI>&s;trange</HI> kind of Command given to the <HI>Man,</HI> for his Hand was <HI>withered:</HI> How then could he be required to <HI>&s;tretch it out?</HI> It was not in his <HI>Power,</HI> it was a thing <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for him to do; and it might therefore &s;eem <HI>vain</HI> to attempt it.</P>
<P>But &s;ee the good <HI>Effect</HI> of our Lord's commanding him! <HI>Power</HI> accompanied the Precept; Power was
<PB N="4" REF="004353_0006_1004499BE8DD4208">given him to obey it. He <HI>tried</HI> at the Word of Chri&s;t, and found <HI>Strength</HI> put into the Arm, and out it <HI>&s;tretch'd;</HI> yea and was <HI>re&s;tored whole</HI> as the other. The Effect was &s;udden and perfect, in an <HI>In&s;tant,</HI> like the Work of GOD. He found the <HI>Cure</HI> wro't, upon his fir&s;t <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> to obey. CHRIST <HI>&s;pake and it was done!</HI> &s;o the FATHER <HI>worketh &s;till, and He works.</HI> The im|potent Man <HI>tried</HI> to obey, and was <HI>enabled</HI> and re|&s;tored.</P>
<P>It was his <HI>right Hand,</HI> Luke vi. 6. The Hand with which he had wrought, or was to work for his <HI>Liveli|hood,</HI> at his Trade or Calling. It is &s;aid, he was a <HI>Ma|&s;on</HI> or <HI>Bricklayer</HI>
