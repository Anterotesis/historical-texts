<HEAD>To Mr. ISRAEL HOLLY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR piece which was printed la&s;t fall, at <HI>New-London,</HI> entitled <Q>The New-Te&s;ta|ment interpretation of the Old, relative to in|fant bapti&s;m,&mdash;written letter-wi&s;e to Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Backus,</HI> occa&s;ioned by his late an&s;wer to Mr. F&mdash;'s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Eheuezer Frothingham, <HI>of</HI> Middletown <HI>in</HI> Connecticut.</NOTE> letter,</Q> has further confirmed me in a &s;entiment which I adopted many years ago, viz. That a very great part of the controver|&s;ies, among good men, are cau&s;ed by their mi&s;|taking each others ideas. But there are &s;o ma|ny things in our dark world &s;till to keep them in the&s;e mi&s;takes, that nature is ready to &s;ay, 'tis in vain to make any further attempts to rectify them. Yet other con&s;iderations have induced me to make another &s;hort trial, to &s;hew you wherein you have mi&s;taken the &s;criptures, as well as the ideas of your friend, concerning bap|ti&s;m,</P>
<P>You tell me, that the thing which moved you to write again&s;t me, was my holding forth, <Q>That in order to maintain infant bapti&s;m, you con|&s;true and interpret the New-Te&s;tament by the Old, and not the Old by the New,</Q> p. 4. Which you think is contrary to fact with regard to your|&s;elf,
<PB N="4" REF="012317_0003_0F8A206BF199E810">and you &s;uppo&s;e that if we were willing to receive the New-Te&s;tament interpretation of the Old, we al&s;o &s;hould &s;ee warrant for that practice; and you clo&s;e with giving public notice to me and others, that if we &s;hould pretend to an&s;wer you and not attend directly to your <HI>ground-work,</HI> you &s;hould probably look upon it &s;o impertinent as not to be worthy of a reply, P. 71. I rea|dily join i&s;&s;ue with you here, and de&s;ire that all impertinences may be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from this di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Let then the New-Te&s;tament interpretation of the Old be the ground-work of all our pro|ceedings; and how do you take that? Why, in general you &s;ay, <Q>There was a &s;piritual glory then in being, although veiled with a type. there was then the &s;ame &s;piritual good under the type, that there is now without the type. And all who did not &s;tick in the letter, &s;aw that &s;piritual glory, and embraced that &s;piritual good,</Q> P. 7, 8. I &s;ay the &s;ame with all my heart. You ob&s;erve that the covenant of legal &s;ervices and ceremonies, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, were weak and in&s;ufficient to ju&s;tify and &s;ave tho&s;e who attended them, unle&s;s they by faith looked to the end of tho&s;e things which were to be aboli&s;hed; and that the carnal Jews, who had no true faith to apprehend Chri&s;t in Abraham's Covenant, nor Chri&s;t as the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e &s;hadows, they terminated in the &s;hadow in&s;tead of the &s;ub&s;tance, to their own de&s;truction, P. 23.
<PB N="5" REF="012317_0004_0F8A206C752FB130">And you illu&s;trate the difference between the right u&s;e of tho&s;e things, and the Jews abu&s;e of them, by Paul's familiar <HI>allegory</HI> of the <HI>bond-woman</HI> and the <HI>free,</HI> P. 31,&mdash;34, This was the &s;ubject of my &s;ermon, which, in its &s;econd edition, &s;tands pre|fixed to what I wrote to Mr. F. and which I ex|pre&s;sly refer to, as what I de&s;igned &s;hould be part of my an&s;wer to him, P. 80. And how came you, Sir, to write above &s;eventy pages in his be|half, and never take any notice of that &s;ermon, nor let the reader know that I agree with you in all the&s;e &s;entiments? Indeed I am as far as you are from &s;uppo&s;ing that a man, who writes again&s;t another, is obliged to take notice of every thing the other hath &s;aid; yet for him to commence a di&s;pute, and then recite a great number of truths, which his opponent holds as much as he does, without letting the reader know but that he de|nies them all; this you and all men mu&s;t know is not fair dealing.</P>
<P>And now to come to the point in hand, you ob&s;erve that in Gen. 17. <Q>Circumci&s;ion was in&s;ti|tuted, and directions given for forming Abra|ham's family into a church-&s;tate.&mdash;Certain du|ties and privileges were annexed,&mdash;which were thankfully to be acknowleged and punctually complied with, until God &s;hould plea&s;e to add thereto more rites and ceremonies, or take them all away, which were meerly po&s;itive, and appoint new ones at his plea&s;ure,</Q> P. 9.10.
<PB N="6" REF="012317_0005_0F8A206CFA4FF698">The&s;e have long been the &s;entiments of my heart.</P>
<P>And you allow that if the words in Heb. 8.9. 10. had run in oppo&s;ition to Abraham's cove|nant, you would freely give up the point to me, P. 21. Why then do you &s;tand &s;till to di&s;pute? Becau&s;e you &s;ay, <Q>The words of in&s;piration run quite another way, even to Egypt and Mount Sinai, therefore take notice of them again. I will make a new covenant, <HI>not according to the covenant I made with</HI> their fathers. But when? <HI>In the</HI> DAY <HI>I took them by the band to lead them out of the land of Egypt,</HI></Q> p. 22.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> I have often taken notice of this, and I de&s;ire you to do it once more. That was the DAY in which God added <HI>more</HI> rites and cere|monies to Abraham's covenant. He in&s;tituted the pa&s;&s;over, with its various rules, and &s;aid <HI>every man &s;ervant that is bought for money,</HI> WHEN <HI>thou ba&s;t circumci&s;ed him,</HI> THEN <HI>&s;hall be cat thereof. All the Congregation of I&s;rael &s;hall keep it.</HI> Al&s;o on <HI>that day,</HI> and not till then, he gave orders for bringing <HI>&s;trangers,</HI> and <HI>all their males,</HI> both to circumci&s;ion and the pa&s;&s;over, <HI>Exod.</HI> xii, 43&mdash;48. And when the whole &s;y&s;tem of ordinances and ceremonies were completed for that church in the wilderne&s;s, and the cove|nant was renewed with the whole nation, (many of whom had not <HI>eyes to &s;ee, nor ears to hear</HI>) ju&s;t before they entered <HI>Canaan,</HI> it was to e&s;tabli&s;h them for a people unto him&s;elf, and that he might
<PB N="7" REF="012317_0006_0F8A206DB51FAF88">be unto them a God, AS he had &s;worn unto their <HI>father Abraham,</HI> Deut. xxix, 4&mdash;13. So that what was done when they came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> at <HI>Sinai,</HI> and in the plains of <HI>Moah,</HI> was but the completing of that con&s;titution which fir&s;t be|gan in <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii; and a literal fulfilment of that promi&s;e to Abraham, <HI>I will be a God to thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee.</HI> And &s;ince the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ays, the new covenant is <HI>not according</HI> to that covenant made with their fathers, how do you dare to &s;ay, <Q>The gentile church is grafted into the <HI>&s;ame</HI> covenant&mdash;as the Jewi&s;h church once &s;tood in!</Q> p. 50.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that this is the root of the con|trover&s;y, and you ob&s;erve truly, that one blow at the root of a tree of vile fruit, would do as much good as many again&s;t the branches, p. 52. But if in&s;tead of a vile root you &s;hould be found &s;triking again&s;t the rock, you will find it much wor&s;e than lo&s;t labour. You know that infant bapti&s;m is not expre&s;&s;ed in the Bible, but you &s;uppo&s;e that when the head of a family believed, and was baptized, that he afterwards brought his hou&s;hold upon his faith, and this is the root your cau&s;e &s;tands upon; but the plaine&s;t precept for a new profe&s;&s;or of religion, to bring his hou&s;hold into the church upon his faith, that we have in all the &s;acred oracles, was given on <HI>the day</HI> that <HI>I&s;rael</HI> came out of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and &s;ince the Lord &s;ays, his new covenant is <HI>not according</HI> to that
<PB N="8" REF="012317_0007_0F8A206E8E6BA680">covenant, and the main point of difference which he de&s;cribes is, that <HI>all</HI> who are in the new co|venant &s;hall <HI>know him,</HI> from the <HI>lea&s;t to the great|e&s;t,</HI> is it not &s;urpri&s;ing that you &s;tand where you do?</P>
<P>However, &s;ince you are &s;o kind as to tell us what you think cau&s;es our mi&s;take, I have a no|tion of making a little attempt to requite my friend in the &s;ame way.</P>
<P N="1">1. You &s;uppo&s;e that we had taken our prin|ciples upon <HI>tradition,</HI> and when we came &s;eriou&s;|ly to &s;earch the &s;criptures, we never took the <HI>ideas</HI> belonging to the <HI>words</HI> there u&s;ed, p. 5. I return the compliment; for, as the <HI>philo&s;ophy</HI> and <HI>vain deceit,</HI> after the <HI>traditions of men,</HI> which the Colo&s;&s;ians were warned again&s;t, were attempts to &s;ubject them to <HI>ordinances,</HI> which by tho&s;e means were drawn from the <HI>handwriting</HI> which Chri&s;t had <HI>blotted out,</HI> and <HI>taken out of the way:</HI> Col. 2, 8, 14&mdash;22. So I think it is evident that you have not got &s;o clear of tho&s;e traditions as you imagine you have. My attempt to explain tho&s;e ambiguous terms, which that deceitful philo&s;o|phy invented, and which tradition and not &s;crip|ture has handed down to us, viz. of Abraham's covenant being the covenant of Grace, and that believers now are in the &s;ame covenant, has car|ried your mind away into &s;uch treatment of your brethren, as would &s;hock you in other affairs. Mr. F. had laid tho&s;e ambiguous terms as the
<PB N="9" REF="012317_0008_0F8A206F3B889DA8">foundation of his di&s;cour&s;e; and I ob&s;erved, that in order to &s;ettle this matter it was needful to <HI>explain</HI> what we meant by them, and &s;aid, <Q>I fully concur with Mr. <HI>F.</HI></Q> that <Q>&s;ince <HI>Adam,</HI> our fir&s;t natural head fell from the covenant which he was placed in, the tenor of which was, <HI>do and live; tran&s;gre&s;s and die;</HI> the Mo&s;t High has never come to commune with any of the race of <HI>Adam,</HI> nor to offer good to them, but only in the &s;econd head, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> <Q>And if by covenant of grace, we mean the glorious plan of &s;alvation, which was laid in the divine mind from eternity, and was di&s;covered at <HI>&s;undry times,</HI> and in <HI>divers manners</HI> to the <HI>fathers</HI> in the Old-Te&s;tament, and is brought in clear light in the New; and that one of tho&s;e <HI>divers manners</HI> was by <HI>Abra|ham</HI>'s covenant: In this we have no difference. But if by covenant of grace, he means the <HI>con|&s;titution</HI> and limits of the Jewi&s;h church, which de&s;cended in the line of <HI>natural generation,</HI> tak|ing in with the parents all their natural off-&s;pring, which is evidently his meaning; in this I cannot concur with him for the&s;e rea&s;ons.</Q> One of which is, becau&s;e, <Q>The tenor of <HI>Abra|ham</HI>'s covenant enjoined conditions, and works to be performed by men; the neglect of which expo&s;ed them to be <HI>cut off from their people,</HI> becau&s;e they had <HI>broken</HI> that <HI>covenant,</HI> Gen. 17.14.</Q> therefore the <HI>letter</HI> of it was, <Q><HI>do
<PB N="10" REF="012317_0009_0F8A207055AD58D0">and live;</HI> and the rea&s;on here given for &s;etting of it a&s;ide is, <HI>becau&s;e they continued not in it, and I regarded them not, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> But the tenor of the new covenant is, <HI>I will be to them a God, and they &s;hall be to me a people,</HI> Heb. 8.9.10." P. 52&mdash;54. of my book the&s;e are my words; but you pick out a few of them, without either of the&s;e texts of &s;crip|ture, and then &s;ay; "I don't know what you really think <HI>Abraham</HI>'s covenant was. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> &s;aid it was <HI>the covenant of grace,</HI> but you op|po&s;e him in that, and mean to contradict him,</Q> p. 11. And &s;o becau&s;e I oppo&s;e that's being called <HI>The covenant of Grace,</HI> which per|&s;ons come into by <HI>natural generation</HI> (for in no other &s;en&s;e did I oppo&s;e him) I &s;ay, becau&s;e I oppo&s;e that language of tradition, you go on to declare me, and my brethren through me, to be &s;o hetredox as to pretend, <Q>That the <HI>Sinai</HI> di&s;|pen&s;ation was given of God, as the covenant of works, and that the Jewi&s;h church was formed by God upon the covenant of works, and circumci&s;ion in&s;tituted of God as the &s;eal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here note that in my 53. page, it was by mi&s;take print|ed <HI>&s;eal,</HI> where I wrote <HI>&s;eat.</HI></NOTE> of the covenant of works,</Q> P. 35. And you go &s;o far as to &s;ay that, <Q>according to the bap|ti&s;ts, the true church never had exi&s;tence un|til the go&s;pel day,</Q> p. 45. with a great deal
<PB N="11" REF="012317_0010_0F8A207225FC3670">more of like nature; which are as real breach|es of the ninth commandment, as were ever ut|tered by man; and which appears more &s;urpri&s;|ing from you, &s;ince you own that the apo&s;tle, in the Hebrews, <Q>u&s;es the words <HI>covenant</HI> and <HI>te&s;|tament,</HI> as terms &s;ynonimous; and therefore is not there di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;o directly between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace, as he is between the Old and New-Te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ations, P. 23.</Q> If &s;o, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> came you to abu&s;e your brethren as you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> done, only becau&s;e they oppo&s;e the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, that both the Old and New <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> are in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> covenant! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> my heart, to &s;ee you thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> with tradition, to violate divine rule!</P>
<P N="2">2. You &s;uppo&s;e we mi&s;take in not di&s;tingui&s;h|ing between the external admini&s;tration of the covenant, and its internal efficacy, P. 41. But how do you prove it? You make much of <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.11. but &s;ay of us that we <Q>&s;eem to be as much afraid to have this text held up before us, as we would be of a loaded cannon; and &s;ay, I never yet was able to obtain a rational an|&s;wer,</Q> p. 37. To which I &s;hall &s;ay, that nei|ther my courage nor rea&s;on have at all fled at the &s;ight of this text, &s;o but that I &s;hall come &s;o near as to take your own dialect, &s;ince you can't under&s;tand ours. I take it that <HI>Paul</HI> there &s;peaks of the internal efficacy of the covenant on <HI>Abra|ham's</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="012317_0011_0F8A2072477600F0">heart. You agree with me that circum|ci&s;ion was a type of Chri&s;t's death, and of an inward change, p. 38.39. Well, <HI>Abraham</HI> had experienced the internal efficacy of the&s;e things before circumci&s;ion was appointed; therefore it was a <HI>&s;eal</HI> to him of <HI>the faith which he bad, yet be|ing uncircumci&s;ed,</HI> that he might be the <HI>father of all them that believe,</HI> whether circumci&s;ed or not: From whence the apo&s;tle argues again&s;t the con|tinuance of tho&s;e types, now the antitype is come. But what a poor figure does his argu|ment make, in the dre&s;s men would now put it into? To &s;ay, <Q>The covenant of which circum|ci&s;ion was a <HI>&s;ign,</HI> is the <HI>&s;ame</HI> to all <HI>Abraham</HI>'s <HI>&s;piritual</HI> &s;eed, as it was to his <HI>natural</HI> po&s;terity:</Q> What argument could be &s;tronger to prove that all his &s;piritual &s;eed ought to circumci&s;e their children! The very principle which the Apo&s;tle was there oppo&s;ing with all his might!</P>
<P>Circumci&s;ion was a <HI>&s;ign</HI> or <HI>token</HI> of the cove|nant which con&s;tituted the Jewi&s;h church, and it is never called a <HI>&s;eal</HI> to them in all the bible; but it was a &s;eal to <HI>Abraham</HI> of the faith, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> had in the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t, and of &s;alvation through him, both to Jews and Gen|tiles; which promi&s;e was given him in <HI>Gen.</HI> 12.3. and 15.5.6. to which places all the apo&s;tle's arguments in <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. and <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. expre&s;sly re|fer, and not to <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. as you imagine. And if you &s;earch chronology, you will find it general|ly,
<PB N="13" REF="012317_0012_0F8A207300BB0300">if not univer&s;ally, agreed to by the learned, that the 430 years, which the apo&s;tle mentions, is to be reckoned from <HI>Abraham</HI>'s fir&s;t call out of his own country, when the promi&s;e was given him of being <HI>heir of the world,</HI> which promi&s;e was not through the law, but through Chri&s;t and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.13. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.14&mdash; 17. Now after his ju&s;tification by faith in this promi&s;e, he went and took the <HI>bond-woman,</HI> and had a &s;on by her, who was 13 years old when circumci&s;ion was in&s;tituted, and he was the fir&s;t of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s &s;eed that partook of it, which we have &s;een was an allegory of the jewi&s;h covenant, in di&s;tinction from that which the go&s;pel-church is in, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.24.</P>
<P N="3">3. You &s;ay, <Q>The bapti&s;ts don't di&s;tingui&s;h between the true nature, and right improve|ment of the ceremonial in&s;titutions, and how the Jews in general did improve them,</Q> p. 41. But thou that teache&s;t others, teache&s;t thou not thy&s;elf? The con&s;titution and ordinances of the Jewi&s;h church were &s;hadows of good things to come, and <HI>Abraham</HI>'s fir&s;t &s;on that was circum|ci&s;ed, being born only by ordinary generation, and the other by &s;upernatural power, of parents <HI>as good as dead,</HI> according to <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> were types of the difference between the children of his <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>elect;</HI> and it is expre&s;sly among the <HI>election of grace</HI> that believing gentiles are <HI>grafted in,</HI> Rom. 9.8. and 11.5.17. and this grafting,
<PB N="14" REF="012317_0013_0F8A2074A5321840">if we compare it with <HI>John</HI> 15.1&mdash;6. is into Chri&s;t by faith, and into his church by a per&s;o|nal profe&s;&s;ion of it; for, <HI>with the heart man be|lieveth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, and with the mouth con|fe&s;&s;ion is made unto &s;alvation,</HI> Rom. 10.10. But if any who are received into the church prove fruitle&s;s, they will be <HI>broken off,</HI> and <HI>taken away,</HI> while living branches are <HI>purged,</HI> that they may bring forth <HI>more fruit.</HI> This appears to be the true nature, and right improvement of the &s;ha|dow and the &s;ub&s;tance, and the true di&s;tinction between <HI>Jews by nature,</HI> and <HI>&s;inners of the Gen|tiles,</HI> and its influence was &s;o pernicious as to carry both <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> away with <HI>di&s;&s;i|mulation,</HI> Gal. 2.11&mdash;15. which moved <HI>Paul</HI> to with&s;tand them to the face. And he proceeds to &s;hew that all are under the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> of the broken law, till they are <HI>redeemed</HI> by Chri&s;t, and re|ceive the <HI>promi&s;e of the Spirit through faith,</HI> which are the <HI>ble&s;&s;ings of Abraham,</HI> that were to <HI>come on the Gentiles.</HI> And he &s;ays, "The &s;cripture hath concluded <HI>all</HI> under &s;in, that the <HI>promi&s;e</HI> by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t might be given to <HI>them that believe;</HI> and IF ye be Chri&s;t, THEN are ye Abra|ham's &s;eed, and heirs <HI>according to the promi&s;e,</HI> Gal. 3, 10,&mdash;14.22.29.</P>
<P>Promi&s;e of what? Of <HI>remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins,</HI> and the <HI>gi&s;t of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and <HI>as many</HI> of the Jews

You, Sir, go back to the "federal holine&s;s" of the Old-Te&s;tament, to interpret the word <HI>holy</HI> by, in 1 Cor. 7.14, p. 50.

Per&s;onal qualifications were required for both ordinances; and a ne|glect of either of them expo&s;ed them to be cut off from that church; but to have circumci&s;ed a child before he was eight days old would have been a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and &s;o it would to have offered a calf, lamb or kid, before that age, be|cau&s;e God would have no <HI>unclean</HI> thing offered to him, Exod. 22.30. Levit. 22.27. As to the &s;pi|ritual things which the&s;e were types of, in them I &s;uppo&s;e we agree: And &s;o we do about the manner of eating the pa&s;&s;over; but for you to blend type and antitype together as you do, p. 56. is not ju&s;t.

<P>I fully agree with you, that there is an e&s;&s;ential difference between moral duties and po&s;itive in|&s;titutions. Morality in all ages is in its nature as immutable as the perfections of the deity; but in&s;titutions of wor&s;hip depend intirely upon his &s;overeign will, and po&s;itive appointment; and I like well your de&s;cription of God's fir&s;t forming <HI>Abraham</HI>'s family into church-&s;tate, with cer|tain duties and privileges annexed, which were to be thankfully received, and punctually ob|&s;erved, <Q>until God &s;hould plea&s;e to add there|to more rites and ceremonies, or take them all away,&mdash;and appoint new ones at plea&s;ure.</Q> Now the &s;ingle point between us is, whether he has <HI>taken away</HI> that <HI>covenant</HI> which con&s;tituted that church, and appointed a <HI>better covenant, which is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon better promi&s;es;</HI> or whe|ther the covenant is the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> and only changed into different hands, with the appointment of different ordinances.

Yet you can't get but three pages forward before you call them <Q>the little children of God's <HI>gracious</HI> covenant.</Q> And how near was your &s;ight when you &s;aid, <Q>although there is <HI>no mention</HI> made of <HI>infants,</HI> yet hou&s;holds include infants, and that is <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> for our purpo&s;e?</Q> p. 51.

<P>And, my friend, how &s;harp was you, to &s;up|po&s;e you could read infants in <HI>Lydia</HI>'s hou&s;e?

<P>Once more, how careful was you to &s;ee that your words and ideas went together, in your at|tempt to pull down my pride? As I had wrote three or four times on this controver&s;y without being an&s;wered, you repre&s;ent me as conceiting I <Q>had &s;truck all with &s;uch intimidating fear, that there was no one &s;tripling left who dare en|counter with this great <HI>Goliah,</HI> that has been the&s;e &s;everal times defying one branch of the army of the living God, viz. the little child|ren of his gracious covenant,</Q> p. 68. I have been deeply &s;en&s;ible the&s;e many years that pride is as bad an enemy as any I have to conflict with and would gladly improve your help as well as others to keep him down; but have I been defy|ing infants!

<P>But, my friend, it is too late in the day to make a je&s;t of the&s;e matters. I mu&s;t come to deal yet more &s;eriou&s;ly with you.

And when &s;ome of us were convinced of this, and act|ed accordingly, Mr. F's letter, and yours, will &s;hew how we have been treated by our brethren: And lately this controverly has appeared, and is carried to a great height, among tho&s;e called &s;tanding mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Dr. Bellamy has written a number of times again&s;t the half-way covenant, and has taken much pains to &s;hew that the covenant which is publicly owned, implies a profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving grace; and therefore, that if the per&s;on who makes the profe&s;&s;ion has no grace, his profe&s;&s;ion is a lie. But many have tried to avoid this con|&s;equence. At length Mr. Mo&s;es Mather pub|li&s;hed a pamphlet, to prove that the vi&s;ible church is in covenant with God, according to Abraham's convenant, and con&s;equently that all
<PB N="29" REF="012317_0028_0F8A2086756D0080">who are in covenant ought to be in the u&s;e of all the means and ordinances of it, in order to obtain grace and &s;alvation. Again&s;t this the Dr. wrote 80 pages, and becau&s;e Mr. M. left the word <HI>grace</HI> out of his de&s;cription of the external co|venant, he charges him with <Q>giving up the grounds,</Q> on which Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Dickin&s;on, Clark</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;twick,</HI> vindicated infant bapti&s;m.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Bellamy's fir&s;t piece again&s;t Mr. Mather, page. 9.</NOTE> And the Dr. repre&s;ents Mr. M's covenant to be &s;o void of any privilege that he &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 75.</NOTE> <Q>He has no right, upon his &s;cheme, to the apo&s;tles an&s;wer in Rom. 3.1.2. For, as to <HI>the oracles of God,</HI> which he claims for one of the chief privileges of his external covenant, he will grant, that they are common to the unbap|tized, i. e. the unbaptized have as good a right to read and hear the word of God, as the baptized have; and as good a right to believe and embrace the go&s;pel. For, by Chri&s;t's la&s;t commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>the go&s;pel is to be preached to all nations;</HI> yea, to <HI>every creature:</HI> And that, previous to, and in order to prepare men for bapti&s;m, Mar. 16.15.16. So that, there is not the lea&s;t need of being in his external co|venant, in order to have as good a right to hear and believe, and be ju&s;tified by the go&s;pel, as any man on earth has: <HI>For there is no dif|ference,</HI>

<P>Well done doctor! here you talk rea&s;on and &s;cripture too. But if a &s;tranger might be &s;o bold as to a&s;k, whether natural generation conveys grace to your child or not? 'Tis likely the an&s;wer would be, no, by no means: And if it might be farther a&s;ked, whether you hold to the popi&s;h doctrine, of the &s;acraments, conferring grace by the <HI>operation of work done?</HI> Would you not re&s;ent the &s;ugge&s;tion with abhorrence?&mdash; If neither natural generation, nor what parents and mini&s;ters have <HI>done,</HI> in baptizing children, confer grace upon them, where are they before God gives it to them but in Mr. Mather's <HI>external</HI> covenant? And to imagine that they have a better claim to the &s;pirit's influence to make the means of grace effectual, than other &s;inners; this the Dr. truly ob&s;erves is incon&s;i&s;tent with God's <HI>having mercy on whom he will have mercy.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 76. As to your &s;aying, <Q>The que&s;tion is not whether bapti&s;m &s;ecures the &s;alvation of the child of a believer, nor whether it enables the child to believe; but whether the child is not hereby brought under an additional obligation to believe and repent?</Q> Which you a&s;&s;ert he is, p. 61. I an&s;wer, that all God's appointments add to our obligation; but the que&s;tion between us is, whether infant bapti&s;m be his appointment or not? And to beg the que&s;tion and then argue from it is poor bu&s;ine&s;s. As to God's precious promi&s;es to his &s;aints, of the out-pouring of his &s;pirit on their children, I tru&s;t I prize them as much as you do: But ob&s;erve their order, particularly that you mention, p. 26. Fir&s;t the &s;pirit is poured on their offspring, which gives life and cau&s;es them to <HI>&s;pring up,</HI> and then they profe&s;s his name, and <HI>&s;ub&s;cribe with their hand unto the Lord,</HI> I&s;a. 44.3&mdash;5. The Dr. knows, by the two la&s;t texts he quotes, that the apo&s;tles were limited in their fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ion, to preach to none but &s;uch as were in Abraham's covenant; but by their la&s;t, they were commanded to teach all nations; and how great a difference between the covenants does this di&s;cover!</NOTE></P>

Mr. M. has publi&s;hed a reply, in which he &s;ays, <Q>It is evident, that it is not from the covenant of grace, &s;trictly taken, but from a <HI>particular po&s;itive in&s;titution,</HI> that the vi&s;ible churh derives its being. It is the covenant of grace that compo&s;eth, and unites the &s;everal members of Chri&s;t's &s;piritual body, but the vi|&s;ibe body of Chri&s;t is compo&s;ed, and united by a particular in&s;titution.</Q> And he charges the doctor with "u&s;ing the argument of the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts,</HI>" becau&s;e he does not regard this di&s;tinction.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mather's &s;econd piece on the covenant, printed at New-Haven, 1770, p. 77. 78.</NOTE> Thus a frightful name that &s;uper|&s;tition has impo&s;ed upon us, &s;erves each party in their turn, in the room of argument, though of|ten to the injury of truth: For it is not truth to &s;ay, we do not ob&s;erve this di&s;tinction. And while they both try to &s;upport their &s;entiments by Abraham's covenant, yet neither of them dare act up to it. For Mr. M. who goes the far|the&s;t,
<PB N="32" REF="012317_0031_0F8A2089C6ED6448">ob&s;erves, that Abraham's covenant, as it was renewed in Deut. 29. took in all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> whether <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> or <HI>ab&s;ent,</HI> and was extended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <Q>even to &s;uch who&s;e <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to it was not to as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Page 72.</NOTE></Q> Yet as to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ays, <Q>It is allowed on all hands, that it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> outward profe&s;&s;ion, confirmed with the ap|pointed &s;eal by which a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> a mem|ber of the vi&s;ible church.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 77. What this profe&s;&s;ion is, he leaves in the dark, and dwells chiefly on the negative, that it cannot be a profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving grace; and a&s;&s;erts that the <HI>only po&s;&s;ible method</HI> of erecting a vi&s;ible church in that way, mu&s;t be by covenanting upon an <HI>ab&s;olute certainty,</HI> p. 82. This is a plea they dwell much upon; though you truly ob&s;erve to the mini&s;ter of Harwinton, that 'tis full as much again&s;t them as us; for 'tis as much the divine preroga|tive to know certainly that a man has moral &s;incerity, and &s;peculative faith, when he profe&s;&s;es it, as it is to know one has gracious &s;incerity, and &s;aving faith when he profe&s;&s;es that. And as to a certainty of our own &s;tate, Mr. Edwards again&s;t Mr. Williams, goes much further; for he proves it to be a maxim with Mr. Stoddard, and with prote&s;tants in general, that <HI>ab&s;olute certainty</HI> of the &s;criptures being true, is attained only by their &s;aving power on our hearts. And if &s;o, then 'tis &s;elf-evident that <HI>ab&s;olute certainty</HI> of our hav|ing a right to a &s;cripture-ordinance, cannot be had, with|out &s;aving faith. So that this argument from certainty, would only exclude the doubting Chri&s;tian, till he attained a&s;&s;urance; while it lays a <HI>certain</HI> bar again&s;t every unrege|nerate per&s;on under heaven, till he is &s;avingly enlightned.</NOTE></Q> Thus he appears to know, that the covenant now is not the &s;ame that the Jewi&s;h church &s;tood in, and yet you all will plead that 'tis the &s;ame. We know as well as that gentleman, that the
<PB N="33" REF="012317_0032_0F8A208A318AC510" MS="y">were added in being under the former di&s;pen&s;a|tion; yet for him to &s;ay as he does, that <Q>There is not the lea&s;t hint in all the apo&s;tles writings, that it was a <HI>new church,</HI></Q> is directly again&s;t the other text that he brings, which &s;ays, Chri&s;t has <HI>aboli&s;hed</HI> tho&s;e Jewi&s;h laws and ordinances, for to make <HI>in him&s;elf</HI> of twain one <HI>new man.</HI> Eph. 2.13&mdash;15. and 3.6. The body is the &s;ame that exi&s;ted under the types; but a <HI>new covenant,</HI> a new po&s;itive in&s;titution of a church-&s;tate, is made with them <HI>not according</HI> to that made with their fathers. And I have no hope of their ever bringing this controver&s;y to an end, till they will come to allow, that the apo&s;tles knew as well how to expre&s;s their own meaning, as any now do how to expre&s;s it for them.</P>
<P>And as I have already proved, that both the hou&s;e of Abraham, and of Aaron, were types of the <HI>hou&s;hold of God,</HI> whereof the go&s;pel-church is con&s;tituted; and as none might mini&s;ter at, or partake with the altar, but Aaron's po&s;terity, and the apo&s;tle &s;ays of go&s;pel-believers, we have an altar whereof they have <HI>no right to eat,</HI> who &s;erve the tabernacle, Heb. 13.10. I leave you to con&s;ider what you are doing, while you claim a <HI>right</HI> to bring your children to a go&s;pel-ordinance upon Abraham's covenant, and yet pay no re|gard
<PB N="34" REF="012317_0033_0F8A208D25BA4788">to Aaron's covenant, which was equally <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> and much more &s;trict; for one ad|mitted of pro&s;elytes, while the other did not.
