<P>OF all the meer Men who have lived &s;ince the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> the Author of this beautiful Pa&s;&s;age is pronounced the wi&s;|e&s;t, by the GOD of Heaven. And of all the Books which he wrote, this is,
<PB N="6" REF="004683_0003_100DB7EC84224210">without Di&s;pute, the mo&s;t elegant, &s;ublime and devout. The three Books which <HI>Solomon</HI> wrote, are re&s;embled to the three Divi&s;ions of the Temple which he built; of which the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> is compar'd to this admirable Song. His <HI>Proverbs</HI> contain an excellent Scheme of Morality; and to this an&s;wers the outward Enclo&s;ure, called the <HI>Court of the Gentiles.</HI> His <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tes</HI> contains the Di&s;qui&s;itions of a philo&s;ophical and religious Genius after true Happine&s;s; and the &s;olemn Reflections and pious Arguments render it a <HI>holy Place.</HI> But this <HI>Divine Song</HI> is all con&s;ecrated Rapture; 'tis the <HI>Holy of Holies:</HI> It mu&s;t be approach'd with Reverence and Trembling, and it admits of no unhal|lowed Feet to tread its awful Rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Title of the Book is, <HI>The Song of Songs;</HI> and it well de&s;erves the Name, for it is the fine&s;t poetical Com|po&s;ure now extant in the World. It is not every where over-nice and exact in its Metaphers and Allu&s;ions; but they are bold and grand, elevated and lofty, all Fire, all con&s;ecrated Rap|ture and In&s;piration!</P>

<P>Among the many fond and endear|ing Sentences, my Text is none of the lea&s;t remarkable. There are a thou|&s;and Beautiful glowing in the Senti|ments and Expre&s;&s;ions.

The Words are a De&s;cription of the Spring of the Year, in the Land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> Great Part of it may be li|terally applied to our Spring: But in &s;ome Re&s;pects it varies. The Winter there, as in our Mother-Country, u&s;ed to be cloudy and rainy, and a &s;teady fair Weather u&s;ed to &s;mile on the Face of the Spring.

<P>Without going into the my&s;tical or prophetical Way of explaining the&s;e Words, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, That they are the Invitation of CHRIST to his beloved Church. Every true Be|liever in JESUS, and Follower of the Lamb, may apply the Addre&s;s to him&s;elf.

Our preaching to them is indeed only pro|phe&s;ying over dry Bones: Though this &s;ometimes does Wonders. In one Word, they act entirely from &s;elfi&s;h Principles, negligent and forgetful of the Glory of GOD. They are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owed down to Earth and Creatures,

<P>And what is implied in this Phra&s;e, when it is &s;poken by our Lord CHRIST to his People? In a few Words, It compri&s;es in it, our Duty to our LORD JESUS. We are called to <HI>believe</HI> in CHRIST. To ri&s;e up from a vain Earth, and rai&s;e our Eyes to invi&s;ible and eternal Realities. To walk by Faith, and not by Sight.</P>
<P><HI>Ri&s;e up;</HI> 'tis a Call to <HI>Repentance</HI> that we are by Nature &s;o bowed down. It comes with a Voice of Conviction and Awakening; to rou&s;e our drow&s;y Faculties, and &s;hake us from our Secu|rity and Indifference. <HI>Ri&s;e up,</HI> or we &s;hall lie down among the dead; &s;lide down to the Congregation of the dam|ned.</P>
<P>'Tis a Call to <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> and Obedi|ence. <HI>Ri&s;e up</HI> and walk: It demands a holy Walk of us; and tells us that our Conver&s;ation &s;hould be in Heaven; that we &s;hould &s;eek the Things which are above, and carry our Trea&s;ure over into the other World. The Path of the Ju&s;t&mdash;&s;hines brighter as it ri&s;es higher.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004683_0010_100DB7FB8FC6AE58">
<HI>Ri&s;e up,</HI> it be&s;peaks our <HI>Meditation</HI> and <HI>Prayer.</HI> Lift up your Eyes and Hands, your Hearts and your Souls.

<P>The&s;e, I think, are natural Heads for Meditation from the Words: But that which I principally intend to al|lude to, in the Proce&s;s of this Di&s;cour&s;e, is, that when we &s;ee the annual Spring open upon the Earth, we have a Call
<PB N="15" REF="004683_0012_100DB8016240FB60">to <HI>Ri&s;e up to CHRIST in holy Medi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ations:</HI> To come away from lower Objects to him the highe&s;t and mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orthy of all.

<P N="2">II. <HI>How is the Invitation of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour to ri&s;e up and come away, pecu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iarly adapted to the Spring of the Year?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Spring looks like the natural Beginning of the Year:</HI> And be&s;ure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e are to begin our Year with GOD. The Demand and Expectation of the le&s;&s;ed GOD is, for the <HI>fir&s;t-ripe Fruits.</HI> And it is rea&s;onable that our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;t Care &s;hould be to plea&s;e him, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;t Hours con&s;ecrated to him.

<PB N="16" REF="004683_0013_100DB802EBF1D8F0">Reflection all the Year, for us to call to Mind how we have been enabled to &s;pend the fir&s;t Months of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Temptations of the Spring af|ford another Argument for us to obey the Call of CHRIST, Ri&s;e up, and come away.</HI> That the Spring is attended with many Circum&s;tances to tempt a|way our Minds from GOD and Du|ty, will very ea&s;ily be rendred plain and evident. Then 'tis that the Face of Nature puts on the mo&s;t gay and alluring Smiles; and the beautiful Pro&s;|pects about us are apt to catch away our Thoughts, and po&s;&s;e&s;s and fill up our Minds. Then 'tis too, that our animal Spirits are mo&s;t &s;prightly and vigorous; and our fermented Blood pours along its rapid Current more warm and impetuous. The Chains of the Winter are melted off: and the <HI>Bands of Orion are loo&s;ed:</HI> And from this Flu&s;h of Blood and Spirits, there ari&s;es a Variety of Temptations. Our Appetites are mo&s;t raging and violent and our inferiour Faculties mo&s;t apt t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> u&s;urp the Throne of Rea&s;on and Con+&s;cience. We are now mo&s;t ea&s;ily de|ceived
<PB N="17" REF="004683_0014_100DB8052A3DACC8">with the tempting Pro&s;pects of Futurity; and we pre&s;ume upon a vain Earth, and Happine&s;s here below, from a Warmth of Temper, and the Di&s;po|&s;ition of our Blood and animal Spirits. Thus we &s;ee the Temptations of the Spring both external and internal. Ex|ternal, from the alluring Face of Na|ture; Internal, from our own Frame and Con&s;titution. How proper then the Call? <HI>Ri&s;e up and come away.</HI> Does the <HI>low</HI> Face of the Ground tempt us? <HI>Ri&s;e up.</HI> Get above the Earth. Leave the Molehill for the Emmits to inhabit; but let us take to our &s;elves Wings, as Angels, and fly away. Have we our Temptations in <HI>our &s;elves? Come away</HI> then; let us get out of our &s;elves into CHRIST; &s;e|parate our &s;elves from our &s;elves, and mortify and root out the corrupted &s;elf|i&s;h Principle in us.</P>
<P>And indeed nothing will have a greater Tendency to demon&s;trate our Sincerity in Religion, than our Re&s;o|lution to defeat the &s;tronge&s;t Tempta|tions which a&s;&s;ault us in this World. When Sin &s;preads all its Snares, and lays all its alluring Bates in our Way,
<PB N="18" REF="004683_0015_100DB8080E673D98">if we have then Power to overcome all, and pa&s;s unhurt amid&s;t all, it will be a good Evidence that we are in&s;pi|red with a Power &s;uperiour to our own: That the Holy Spirit is in us; and that we are in good Earne&s;t in Religion. The &s;ame Arguments to per&s;uade Youth to &s;erious Piety, are in the &s;ame Sen&s;e proper to per&s;wade us to Religion in the Spring. Becau&s;e we may all the Year look back on it with this concomitant Satisfaction, When Temptations were mo&s;t univer&s;al, and mo&s;t impetuous, I &s;tood the Shock, and was carried graciou&s;ly thro' them.</P>
<P>And what an Honour will it be for us to overcome Temptations when they are at the &s;tronge&s;t; and regu|late our Appetites when they are mo&s;t raging and lawle&s;s? So <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> fortifi|ed with the Grace of GOD, with&s;tood Satan and him&s;elf together, joined in the mo&s;t dangerous League; he broke loo&s;e from the Toils of Death, and by a wi&s;e Retreat, ru&s;hed away, pur&s;ued by Victory and Triumph.
