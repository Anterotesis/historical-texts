<P>TO promote this lovely &s;entiment, and to provide its riche&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, men in all ages, have formed various a&s;&s;ociations. Among the&s;e, is the <HI>Order of Free Ma&s;ons,</HI> which we this day honor by our public &s;olemnities, and by the con&s;ecration of a Lodge, and its Officers, agreeably to this benev|olent in&s;titution.</P>
<P>THOUGH Ma&s;onry, in its priciples, be venera|ble in the mo&s;t antient traditions, yet its form mu&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="031798_0005_0FEE72313141F858">have been improved, by the progre&s;s of the human under&s;tanding. It ro&s;e not a perfect building: It combined its grand proportions, as the arts ad|vanced towards perfection. It had a new aera, at the building of the T'emple, and mu&s;t have &s;een new glory in the ages of chri&s;tianity, when Gre|cian triumphed over Gothic &s;tructures. From our pre&s;ent improvement, it becomes a pertinent enquiry, how our in&s;titution received its la&s;t forms from the light which &s;hone upon Europe. It has been pretended, that it was aided by the Cru|i&s;ades, when Europe engaged in de&s;tructive ad|ventures, formed an object for its ambition in religious enthu&s;ia&s;m. Such enthu&s;ia&s;ts from va|rious nations might require &s;ome a&s;&s;ociating prin|ciple, and originate &s;ome band of union. But this principle would be as far from &s;cience, as was the de&s;ign of their adventures. It would &s;pring out of their enthu&s;ia&s;m, and bear the &s;tronge&s;t marks of a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;i&s;t the cau&s;e in which they engag|ed. It would be as public as their de&s;ign, and as memorable as its con&s;equences. They would think, not of Architecture, but of the March and the Camp; not of Geometry, but of the Cro&s;s. But the red Cro&s;s in the Banner is unknown to us, and our &s;ignal is not for victory. The age of chivalry has no better claim. It is unknown in our emblems, and prevailed in a country, we have
<PB N="7" REF="031798_0006_0FEE7234064A3EA8">lea&s;t vi&s;ited. Our la&s;t hi&s;tory has nothing con|nected with Grecian my&s;teries, or common with the My&s;tics. Though allied to the antient man|ners of the north, it attended not in &s;ilence upon the circles of the Druids, where the &s;cience of the &s;quare never appeared. We look el&s;ewhere for its pre&s;ent form. And we follow with cau|tious &s;teps, its progre&s;s from the ea&s;t. The old Chronicles atte&s;t, that early a&s;&s;ociations exi&s;ted in the northern regions, and that the&s;e fraternities, of which the nobility <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mallet.</NOTE> were members, long pre|&s;erved their primitive form. Upon the reception of chri&s;tianity, they welcomed the doctrines and arts, which accompanied it. Their &s;ilence, their elections, their members, their monumental &s;tones, concur to explain our progre&s;s. The conci&s;e Tacitus will give us many lines for compari&s;on. Even in Iceland, we &s;ee the five magi&s;trates, the or|dinary and extraordinary meetings, the members, who were freemen, the a&s;&s;emblies at the &s;ol&s;tices, the pure manners, the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the &s;ongs, and the fund for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, even before the u&s;e of writ|ten laws. Part of the pay was fea&s;ting, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tacitus.</NOTE> and at the&s;e fea&s;ts, their obligations were renewed. In the northern regions the&s;e Lodges are yet to be &s;een, and the monumental columns, and <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cordiner's Scenery of the North, 1780.</NOTE> Torfeus will
<PB N="8" REF="031798_0007_0FEE723800213400">inform us of the fir&s;t arti&s;t, and of the contribu|tions of Europe, to which we are indebted for the noble &s;tructures of the tenth century. To be known abroad the Chri&s;tian Architects encour|aged our in&s;titution. The Keledci, or Emi&s;&s;aries of the &s;acred colleges employed it, as concurring with the be&s;t manners of their converts. The Runie character is &s;till imitated upon our records, as the fir&s;t introduced into that part of Europe, from which we de&s;cended. Chri&s;tian have unit|ed with antient emblems, that we might honor the be&s;t in&s;titutions and partake of them, while we forget not our origin, or our antiquity, Our re|turn to light is Chri&s;tian, but our fellow&s;hip is more antient. The Lodge is finely &s;ituate on the &s;hore, while the retreating tide tells the Brother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> was caught at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;ea.</NOTE> upon his fir&s;t landing of the danger of perfidy and guilt. The Acacia is oppo&s;ed to the Mi&s;&s;el|toe, and the body of Balder is not forgotten. The paintings &s;hewn to the apprentice are of the original kind. The higher grades have been conjoined with le&s;&s;ons from the &s;chools of Greece, and more modern inventions. Each image is &s;imple in the fir&s;t order, and the progre&s;s is &s;een as we ri&s;e. Hence we find as the antient order travelled &s;outhward in Britain, after the conque&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="031798_0008_0FEE72398894CED0">of the Danes, that the York Lodge claims high|e&s;t antiquity, and united the &s;implicity of the north, with the gay freedom of a more &s;outhern &s;ky. Builders then came from all nations, and this &s;tately Fabric on its fir&s;t foundations &s;tands firm and glorious.</P>
<P>LET us examine this &s;pacious habitation. A Lodge is not the abode of one &s;olitary family. It bars not its doors in the &s;torm, and dreads not to give the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the night. It has its build|ings erected on the mo&s;t de&s;ert path of life, and they &s;tand open to receive every fatigued and be|nightened Brother. It is one, becau&s;e one &s;oul inhabits all its regions. A Brother is at home wherever a Brother dwells. We have &s;een the worthy; who have had many an honor, come and expire calmly in our arms. We dropped the Acacia into the tomb, and have &s;een them &s;lumber in peace. We have given the kind &s;alutation to the ho&s;tile &s;ons of Afric's once delightful &s;hore. They have eaten of our bread, and have ta&s;ted of our wine, with which they have been refre&s;hed. We have &s;een Brethren retreating from the cruel|ty of blood, partaking of our joys. The&s;e kind offices have extended our thoughts to generous love. We have &s;earched for, and we have found, from different nations, the &s;ame friends of mankind.
<PB N="10" REF="031798_0009_0FEE723B12AAABD8">How u&s;eful would be a true hi&s;tory of Ma&s;on|ry! The Saints have their Books of Martyrs. The gay world, their novels for amu&s;ement. Na|tions have their hi&s;tory. Might not Ma&s;onry, through the State find a &s;ubject worthy of the friend of mankind? To &s;ee the ho&s;pitable lodges di&s;trib|uted around the enlightened world, and to travel in one evening of meditation through all the Lodges on the globe. We tru&s;t that our ri&s;ing order will not long be deprived of this invaluable plea&s;ure. To adorn a quiet &s;eat may be our delight; but to enter with the &s;entiment, that we belong to the world of friend&s;hip and life, mu&s;t give the highe&s;t glory to the character of man.</P>
<P>THEN &s;hall we a&s;&s;emble the ho&s;pitable virtues from all nations. The ea&s;tern traveller &s;hall tell his tale, enlivened by fancy and by hope, to awak|en every kind attachment, and to command in|&s;tant and cheerful relief to &s;orrow. The ready oil, not le&s;s pure than the Samaritan's, &s;hall be poured by the injected thought of kindne&s;s, with|out one fear to check it as it freely flows. Then, as in the hardy north, the good man &s;hall fea&s;t at his open door, and invite each longing appetite to come and be &s;atisfied. Then &s;hall the kind pea&s;ant ri&s;e to &s;urvey the dangers of the path and the mountain, while the inhabitant of the &s;hore
<PB N="11" REF="031798_0010_0FEE723F245D8A30">&s;hall awake from his midnight &s;lumbers, lea&s;t di&s;|tre&s;s &s;hould call in vain. Sweet confidence &s;hall then dwell in the brea&s;t of man, and cheerfulne&s;s di&s;cover, how he repo&s;es on the lap of friend&s;hip. Who can forget the importunity of old Abraham with the &s;tranger! What has civil life done to ad|vance the plea&s;ure of this invitation! In the&s;e forms &s;hall we learn to love. They di&s;play the lovely attractions of &s;implicity, native innocence, and ready &s;ympathy, the pure&s;t virtues of the heart.</P>
<P>WHAT will then be our enquiries? Who knocks now at the Lodge? Who has been wel|comed and ble&s;&s;ed? What cares di&s;turb a weary Brother, and whence can he have relief? Where does his light &s;hine, and is it bright? Are his &s;eet ready at the door for offices of love? Does he come hand in hand with the brethren? Is his heart free to conceive, and his hand ready to be&s;tow? How many days in each month has he recorded on his heart the kindne&s;s done to a Bro|ther, to renew it? In how many nights has he giv|en light to the path of a &s;tranger? Can he &s;ay to a Brother, Let me &s;ee thy countenance, and let me hear thy voice; for &s;weet is thy voice, and thy countenance delights me.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="031798_0011_0FEE7241EB5AEC38">
BUT when is the heart of man mo&s;t open? It is then, we will embrace and enjoy him.</P>
<P>AND are we not all agreed, that man is only &s;een in his friendly di&s;po&s;itions, when the &s;oul is cheer|ful. Then all the cau&s;es, which concur to &s;hut the heart, are lea&s;t felt. Cheerfulne&s;s is required in every &s;tate of innocence and love. The te&s;ti|mony of mankind is ready. How abundant are examples in the &s;criptures of all antiquity. How emblematical the wine, which cheers the heart, and how &s;trong the pictures of a Mahomedan, and of every heaven! Cheerfulne&s;s was re|proached in Je&s;us, but beloved by him, becau&s;e it may correct every vice, and corrupts no principle of virtue. See it, when it accompanies life's ble&s;|&s;ings. It is the &s;ame health of the mind as a good organization is of the body. Then the under|&s;tanding dwells in a clear &s;ky, and the affections, like the pure &s;treams of life, have a divine light to invigorate them. Not all the wi&s;dom of man, not all the motives of his happine&s;s can exalt him like the heart thus free to enjoy the affections brought pure into his &s;oul. The man, cheerful at his la|bour, never for&s;akes it. Cheerful in his dome&s;tic affections, he never wanders from his home. All nature &s;preads her charms before him. Do you &s;ee the intemperate man. He is flying from the cares
<PB N="13" REF="031798_0012_0FEE7244C1F042F8">and duties of his life. He is not in love with him&s;elf and the world. Does he &s;hun dome&s;tic life, his &s;oul is not in peace. Does he &s;olicit di|ver&s;ion for his thoughts, &s;erene plea&s;ure will never bring him virtue and happine&s;s. Take the good apprentice, and it is the cheerful youth, ready for every duty of his calling. Take the good hu&s;band, and his heart is clear as the light, and cheerful as the day. The countenance of the good citizen warms wherever it &s;hines. The public &s;pirited man is cheerful when ble&s;&s;ings multiply around him.</P>
<P>BUT cheerfulne&s;s is not &s;pontaneous in the heart; el&s;e why &s;hould &s;o many gloomy counte|nances, never cleared, offer to our &s;ight? Why &s;o many imaginary cares, to produce endle&s;s di&s;quiets, and to conjure mi&s;ery from the dead? Why is man &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;turbed?</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t then plant and cultivate the virtue, where the pure&s;t &s;ympathies may nouri&s;h it; where the &s;un of benevolence may daily cheer it, and where generous &s;pirits may refre&s;h it. Then it will gather &s;trength in habit, and &s;tand firm again&s;t every bla&s;t by its own power.</P>
<P>IN MASONRY, we cultivate this virtue in the be&s;t manner, by removing from every thing which
<PB N="14" REF="031798_0013_0FEE724785015388">confines the heart. Do competitions in life rai&s;e the angry &s;torm;&mdash;here the breezes refre&s;h from general and diffu&s;ive hope. Does the &s;ad counte|nance alarm by &s;ympathy;&mdash;here it flies, like the white cloud above us, wa&s;ting in aether. Do reli|gious fears &s;traighten the brea&s;t, and heave a &s;igh, as in the dull air of a mi&s;ty morning;&mdash;here the &s;un ri&s;es, &s;oon to &s;catter them, and all the air is in love. Do angry pa&s;&s;ions hang, like the &s;torm, up|on the heart of man;&mdash;here they are driven away by the breath of charity. Do parties thunder like the meeting clouds, and wa&s;te their lightning on the guiltle&s;s;&mdash;here is the &s;erene air, and the bright horizon of peace. Do fears, like the gale, ri&s;e adver&s;e to our hopes;&mdash;&s;oon we quit our dan|gers, and take the gale free in the ocean of be|nevolence. Does di&s;turbed joy, like the gu&s;t, for a moment defy our &s;kill;&mdash;we &s;oon reach the winds which bend their con&s;tant &s;ummer cour&s;e towards the regions where are bal&s;amic flowers, rich &s;pices, and the land of plenty.</P>
<P>COME Cheerfulne&s;s, and find a &s;eat with us. The tales of A&s;ia, and the borrowed romance of Europe, know thee not &s;o well as we. No, not the man of nature, hovering over a winter's fire, to tell his gay loves, and to forget the &s;torm in friend&s;hip and in glee. We will make thee wel|come.
<PB N="15" REF="031798_0014_0FEE724B86718558">We will open our hearts to thee. We fly not our cares. We only &s;eat our&s;elves here, to return with greater delight. We meet from every circle of active life, in one grand circle of love. But it is, to carry home the rich provi&s;ion with which thou can&s;t fill us, till we meet again. We leave the world behind not to hate it, but to a&s;|&s;emble all thy ble&s;&s;ings into our bo&s;oms, and to go abroad and &s;catter them. The friend of our dear|e&s;t love &s;hall confe&s;s, that we tran&s;plant all thy fa|vour to be enriched in her bo&s;om. Cheerful|ne&s;s, come and &s;it with us. Here is love waiting to be cheered by thee. Here all the graces &s;hall attend thee. Joy &s;hall enkindle at thy counte|nance, and laughter be ready at thy call. Social glee &s;hall &s;port without guilt, and in&s;truction &s;teal with kind in&s;inuation into every heart. Charity &s;hall tell her deeds to learn to multiply them, and Sympathy &s;hall repeat them, mirth &s;hall be gay, and the &s;ong &s;hall enrapture the ear, while the thought on which it lives goes welcome to the heart, to dwell there forever. Where can&s;t thou find better friends? Where can&s;t thou in&s;pire purer joys? Enchanted, we will hold thee, and never &s;eparate from thee. Whither thou goe&s;t, we will go. Thou may&s;t vi&s;it other friends, but here &s;hall be thy habitation.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="031798_0015_0FEE724D0FF2F260">
LET us now enquire, how the MASON is prepar|ed for the greate&s;t virtue of the heart, and the exalted duties of an enlightened under&s;tanding. Should he not di&s;cover his qualifications for the highe&s;t character, let him renounce the honor of his name. We expect that he will be among the MOST GENEROUS OF MEN,&mdash;among the mo&s;t EN|LIGHTENED IN SOCIETY,&mdash;and among the mo&s;t CHARITABLE IN RELIGION. This is the charac|ter he claims, and this, it is his ambition to de&s;erve. To become the mo&s;t generous of men, when a Ma&s;on leaves his Lodge, he reflects&mdash;I have pledged my love, and promi&s;ed every kind &s;er|vice to my brethren of every name. How &s;hall I perform my obligation? Can I have a ju&s;t expec|tation, that my virtues will be more pure, becau&s;e I have breathed a freer air than belongs to the crowded habitations of men? Can I then at once return to the contagion of impure regions, and will the pa&s;t draught then nouri&s;h me? Shall not my every thought in life be free as in the Lodge, and corrupt by no vile affection? It is not a &s;hort vi&s;it to the happie&s;t clime, which enables us fore|ver to inhale the be&s;t &s;weets of life. It is the re&s;i|dence in the&s;e purer &s;kies. Each duty then re|tains its fragrance, and the &s;trength is recruited at every hour. A Ma&s;on may change his place, but not his heart. He lives in love, and when he
<PB N="17" REF="031798_0016_0FEE724FE291DE68">dies, love fits on his lips, and &s;peaks the la&s;t lan|guage of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>In &s;ociety the Ma&s;on maintains his dignity. He has &s;een competition lo&s;t, in kind di&s;cour&s;e and mutual endearment. He has often &s;een the gay freedom of one nation, enliven the &s;edate and pen&s;ive countenance of another. The ma|je&s;ty of one nation has yielded to the in&s;inuating manners of another. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the mer|chant, and the indu&s;try of the hu&s;bandman have not made them in&s;en&s;ible to the good humor of the gay. The profe&s;&s;ed friends of &s;cience have not forgotten to mingle with mankind. And having like &s;o many &s;treams united, they have more bountifully &s;upplied life, with wi&s;dom and happine&s;s. He has &s;een man, as he is, when di|ve&s;ted of all his fonde&s;t habits, his deare&s;t &s;elf, and when &s;eparated from the partial views of pri|vate intere&s;t. And the character of man is &s;o much the &s;ame, that he is &s;ure of the true image of the family, and that one nature belongs to them. He lives then as under common wants, and as capable of relief from the &s;ame virtues. All may have the countenance of love, and he &s;tudies to bring the kinde&s;t glances upon him&s;elf. He a&s;ks only what he is ready to give, and if refu&s;ed, refu&s;es not again. Noble life this! Here we fill
<PB N="18" REF="031798_0017_0FEE7252A539F7E0">our cup of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. It in&s;pires by the free&s;t draught, and by its fullne&s;s, we are made divine.</P>
<P>BUT what rites con&s;ecrate this interwiew of the ble&s;&s;ed? The prie&s;t looks for his mitre in vain. The altar is a pure heart, and the wi&s;e man is a friend. The Mahomedan has left his robes, and enters in peace, and the Chri&s;tian di&s;plays not his cro&s;s. Religion is reverenced in &s;ilence, and man appears in the virtues of the heart, beloved for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ergion, as his greate&s;t good, and mo&s;t ample recommendation. Virtue takes its value not from names, or the opinions with which it is a&s;&s;ociated, but from the ble&s;&s;ings it brings. The greate&s;t offering is &s;ocial duty, and the riche&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is love. Thus free, how happy is man. With him&s;elf to choo&s;e; but with the world to love goodne&s;s, wherever it can be found.</P>
<P>BUT we are to remember that we are friends of an in&s;titution, and that we are to commend it not only as pure in its principles, but as &s;upported by peculiar duties, which we owe to it.</P>
<P>TO enter a Lodge does not make a man a Ma|&s;on, more than to enter a Church makes him a Saint. He has his duties there, &s;acred as his happine&s;s, and perpetual as his hopes.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="031798_0018_0FEE725573BEDF38">
IT is then apparent, that every man cannot be a fit &s;ubject of its honors. A &s;lave to prejudice, he cannot be enlightened by truth: Unable to &s;eparate the &s;ocial character from the religious opinion, he is not capable of philanthropy: De&s;|titute of an ingenuous mind in private life, he can|not exerci&s;e a rational and univer&s;al benevolence.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that a Brother owes al&s;o his full concurrence in the liberal purpo&s;es of his Breth|ren. By a con&s;tant attention he gives his per&s;on|al virtues to the Lodge. Ab&s;ent, he withdraws his be&s;t influence from the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>A Brother al&s;o cannot be lo&s;t in a circle of private friends. We might as well &s;it near our fires, and detail &s;tories about London and Paris, and call our&s;elves merchants of tho&s;e cities, as to have no corre&s;pondence with the great world of Ma&s;ons in our Grand Lodges.</P>
<P>A Brother cannot forget the importance of E|lections, and the judgment to be employed in them. The Officers are the &s;oul of the Lodge, and they impart their own character to it. If they are active, con&s;tant and charitable, the Lodge will imitate them. If they fail of their duty, the be&s;t hopes are lo&s;t. They will therefore be en|couraged
<PB N="20" REF="031798_0019_0FEE72598563CE78">by the greate&s;t re&s;pect. Good Officers will create this re&s;pect, but worthy members may e&s;tabli&s;h it. Doubtle&s;s in attention to appearan|ces in the world, we may covet to &s;ee men in of|fice, who have corre&s;ponding offices in civil life. This is a great advantage, but no love of rank &s;hould incur any hazard of the neglect of the du|ty of any appointment. This would be a pride fatal to our Lodge, and contemptible in the mean|e&s;t a&s;&s;ociations. To be fine abroad, and poor at home, has not even decency to recommend it. It is u&s;eful to remember the danger, and never to forget, That the be&s;t Ma&s;ter &s;hould be always the be&s;t Ma&s;on.</P>
<P>A Brother &s;hould con&s;ider al&s;o, how much his per&s;onal virtues a&s;&s;i&s;t an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> order to which he be|longs. The public honors come with double plea&s;ure to us, when we are told, that he who has de&s;erved them, is a Brother. And the great Pat|ron of the Lodges of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts is recollected with this plea&s;ure. When we behold the mon|ument, which &s;tands high upon his grave near their Capital, we remember that it is &s;acred to a Ma&s;on. The friends of WASHINGTON know him in this character. An enthu&s;ia&s;m to give our order &s;up|port from our per&s;onal character, is the mo&s;t gen|erous we can entertain.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="031798_0020_0FEE725B0F706C50">
A TRUE Brother will al&s;o be attentive to the endearments of life, and be the greate&s;t friend to the companion of man. The &s;ympathy of wo|man is the bli&s;s of man. But though equal in her rights, &s;he depends on the generous goodne&s;s of man, for her be&s;t hopes. She depends on man, for the opinion, which gives laws to her condition, and for the power to render them &s;acred. It is with him to enlarge her education, that &s;he may know her worth, and be able to pre&s;erve it. She repays by her &s;ympathy, but &s;he receives from generous virtue. Always the friend of man, &s;he is his &s;lave, his dome&s;tic &s;ervant, or his bo&s;om friend, at his own di&s;cretion. By exalting her, he exalts him&s;elf. The kinder forms of educa|tion, and the mo&s;t noble thoughts of Love belong to the protection of our Order, in its be&s;t de&s;igns to advance human happine&s;s. A greater re|proach cannot fall upon a Ma&s;on, than that he is a &s;tranger to dome&s;tic peace. It is not a want of confidence that has kept our &s;i&s;ters from our a&s;&s;o|ciation, but the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of Civil Socie|ty. The enlightened Brother knows, that if his mind can comprehend his exalted duty, it mu&s;t be the tenderne&s;s of female &s;ympathy which mu&s;t qualify him to receive it.</P>
<P>A TRUE Brother will always venerate age. He &s;uffers it to lean upon his &s;houlder. He covers its
<PB N="22" REF="031798_0021_0FEE725C9B448F70">infirmities, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts to remove its cares. It is his glory to enrich age with ble&s;&s;ings, to provide its con&s;olations, and to fill it with hope. Its occa|&s;ional wants he may not always di&s;cover, but its natural wants he cannot forget.</P>
<P>A Brother will not be an idle &s;pectator of the world. We live in an age of revolutions. Our in&s;titution requires no revolution; but admits our warme&s;t friend&s;hip. While every in&s;titution profe&s;&s;es to collect new force, it is in our power to ri&s;e with glory. Our principles are ju&s;t, and are eternal. They regard the highe&s;t virtues of enlightened &s;ociety; but they exi&s;t in minds con|&s;tantly developing. Their truth is eternal; but may be more clear. They may enjoy a brighter &s;ky. The wi&s;dom of each generation may be like the mildne&s;s of our climate, the more vi&s;ible, the longer it is inhabited. May it not then be &s;aid, that it mu&s;t afford us the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, as Brethren, in having contributed to the honor of the Craft, by per&s;onal merit, and the reputation of our Lodge.</P>
<P>A YEAR had not clap&s;ed, after Ma&s;onry had been welcomed to New England, before New Hamp&s;hire was ble&s;&s;ed with its light. So congen|id in its character with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and emulous
<PB N="23" REF="031798_0022_0FEE7260B1B31178">of all its advantages, this State concurred in the de&s;ign of giving &s;upport to Ma&s;onry. The bands of union have ever been firm between the&s;e States, and on the&s;e &s;olemnities, we tru&s;t that we &s;hall a&s;|&s;i&s;t to perpetuate the friend&s;hip. Happy indeed are we to &s;ee, beyond any former example in our own country, the two Grand Lodges united in this purpo&s;e, and concurring in the con&s;ecration of Lodges in their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions.</P>
<P>AS they began together, may they continue united in the common cau&s;e. Thus the inter|cour&s;e of Brethren pervades the whole Fraternity. Vi&s;its to the Lodges, and the pre&s;ence of Lodges with each other at celebrations, are now proved to be in the &s;pirit of the in&s;titution. May this union of our Grand Lodges be one of the happy events which &s;hall prepare for a repre&s;entation of the order through the world.</P>
<P>FROM the undi&s;&s;embled joy, good order, and harmony of the Brethren, we may congratulate our Brethren of the Lodge this day con&s;ecrated, upon their opening pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>To our brother elected as Ma&s;ter of this Lodge we may give our friendly &s;alutation. It is the highe&s;t glory of God to be loved, by tho&s;e whom he protects. We love him, becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved
<PB N="24" REF="031798_0023_0FEE726380C1D130">us. A faithful Ma&s;ter will have our affections, and in them has the highe&s;t honors we can render him.</P>
<P>YE Watchmen, who guard our Temple, we &s;a|lute you. Perpetual are the ble&s;&s;ings of the Sun, whether he &s;hine in the we&s;t or the &s;outh. He declines, but he turns a full orb of light to the world. He &s;ets to ri&s;e again with his wonted vig|our. We know his cour&s;e, and are &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>YE attendant Lights, we ble&s;s you. If ye &s;erve not as mini&s;ters at every hour, your order makes nature perfect.</P>
<P>HEAVEN has its records and its trea&s;ure. The pure mind keeps the fir&s;t, but the elde&s;t Bro|ther keeps the la&s;t. He was tried, and found faithful. May the &s;ame benevolence and fidelity po&s;&s;e&s;s the heart of him who keeps your depo&s;it.</P>
<P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>WE &s;incerely rejoice with you on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. The duty and the dignity of our order has been our theme. Your virtues can out&s;peak de&s;cription, and by becoming what ye ought to be, ye will prove to the world, that TRUE MASONS ARE THE MOST ENLIGHTENED, AND THE MOST BENEVOLENT OF MEN.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MUCH RESPECTED AUDITORS, <HI>"CUSTOMS A JUDGE, A RULE, AND STANDING LAW,"</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to which, I now come forward on this, to &s;ome of us, at lea&s;t, joyful occa&s;ion; to acknowledge, with gratitude, the honor you do us by your company, and the plea&s;ure we feel in having your countenance on this occa&s;ion; and to a&s;&s;ure you that we &s;hall always endeavor to de|&s;erve your favorable opinion. For my&s;elf, I &s;hall make no apology, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;hare the fate of mo&s;t apologizers on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, that is, of
<PB N="4" REF="031798_0026_0FEE726D1DC809E8">having my &s;incerity que&s;tioned, in&s;tead of engag|ing the candor of my audience.</P>
<P>OUR Society claim the honor of being ancient as any among men; and of being extended as far as the civilized world: and we glory in the thought, that no Lodge of Ma&s;ons was ever ju&s;t|ly chargeable with attempting to rai&s;e di&s;turbances in church or &s;tate.</P>
<P>INFLUENCED by principles of benevolence, we wi&s;h a decrea&s;e of mi&s;ery, and an increa&s;e of happine&s;s to all mankind; not confining our views to particular friends, nations or countries, but ex|tending our good will to all nations, countries and languages. We wi&s;h to &s;ee peace on earth, while we feel good will to all men.</P>
<P>THE Lodge now con&s;tituted in this public manner is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of THE BE|NEVOLENT LODGE: and the grand principle of Ma&s;ons is <HI>brotherly love;</HI> and every practice incon|&s;i&s;tent herewith, is abhorrent to their feelings, while tho&s;e which are calculated to increa&s;e the general felicity are congenial with their mo&s;t ar|dent wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="031798_0027_0FEE726EA5B7AB90">
THE Fraternity of Free and Accepted Ma&s;ons pre&s;ent, of whatever rank, will permit me to con|gratulate them on this au&s;picious day, and unite with them in &s;upplicating that no mi&s;conduct of the <HI>Benevolent Lodge</HI> may ever ca&s;t a gloom upon it. Our country affords an ample field of em|ployment to &s;peculative minds. But a few cen|turies pa&s;t, it was wholly inhabited by &s;avage bea&s;ts, or more &s;avage men. Now, millions of civilized men are &s;pread over it. Our ance&s;tors, often in danger of being de&s;troyed in their youth|ful &s;tate, were as often, almo&s;t, miraculou&s;ly pre|&s;erved; till they arrived at mature age; when they were obliged to vindicate their rights, with the &s;word and bayonet, again&s;t the parent &s;tate. But thanks to that kind providence, without the notice of which not a <HI>&s;parrow</HI> falls to the ground, and by which the <HI>hairs</HI> of our heads are all num|bered; they &s;upported a dangerous war; ob|tained an honorable peace; e&s;tabli&s;hed their rights on a firm ba&s;is; and we may now <HI>&s;it every one under his own vine and figtree and have none to make us afraid.</HI> Happy we may be if we under|&s;tand our own intere&s;ts, and have virtue enough to pur&s;ue them.</P>
<P>WE have now a right to claim rank among the nations of the world. We enjoy pro&s;perity
<PB N="6" REF="031798_0028_0FEE727186C0D9F0">which few others know; and if we are not want|ing to our&s;elves, may continue a happy people. For the&s;e favors we ought to acknowledge with gratitude that providence which extends through creation; that providence which improved our illu&s;trious Brother WASHINGTON in conducting the war; and &s;ince that, at the head of our civil government: In both which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed a reputation which does honor to our Craft, to his country, to human nature; and which cannot be fullied by the tongues of &s;lander, nor exalted by the pens of panegyri&s;ts.</P>
<P>EVENTS that are future are in a great degree hidden from our knowledge; but it requires no &s;pirit of prophecy to determine that within a century or two more, this country will be populous as mo&s;t of the countries in Europe; and if not equal in wealth, vet before them in the means of real happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IN this State, we have a &s;triking di&s;play of the increa&s;e of population. But little more than half a century &s;ince, to wit, at the time of the &s;ettlement of the Rev. Mr WILKINS, lately de|decea&s;ed; this town did not contain twenty fam|ilies: and to the north, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;ingle family of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="7" REF="031798_0029_0FEE7178305853D8">Rivers, to the &s;ettlements in Canada; except a few on the banks of tho&s;e Rivers. There are now, perhaps, an hundred towns, containing from forty or fifty to an hundred and fifty or two hun|dred families, and the means, not barely of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, but of enjoyment, bear proportion to the rapid increa&s;e of inhabitants. What was, within the memory of many now living, a howl|ing wilderne&s;s, is turned to fruitful fields;&mdash; what was a frightful de&s;ert, now blo&s;&s;oms as the ro&s;e. And doubtle&s;s in other States more &s;outh|ern, and where there are more inviting advanta|ges, population and improvement on lands have made a proportionable progre&s;s. Well may our country rejoice in the rapidity of her population and improvement, if not too rapid. Well may we of the Ma&s;onic Fraternity felicitate our&s;elves on the pro&s;pects before us; and though we urge none to join our &s;ociety, we may be allowed to hope that the principles of it will be diffu&s;ed in proportion to the population of our country, and may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that they will be in proportion to the degrees of light and knowledge that are attained by our fellow citizens, whether they join our &s;ociety or not. Our fervent prayer is, that brotherly love may be univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, and the happine&s;s it is calculated to produce, as uni|ver&s;ally enjoyed. And to my Brethren of the
<PB N="8" REF="031798_0030_0FEE727876A51320">Fraternity, I may &s;ay, that we &s;hall be&s;t contribute to this happy purpo&s;e, by conducting agreeable to our principles and obligations; to excite us to which, we &s;hould con&s;ider, that many eyes are upon us be&s;ide the all-&s;eeing one; that we are as a city &s;et on a hill, and under indi&s;pen&s;able obligations &s;o to order our conver&s;ation, at all times, that tho&s;e who wi&s;h to find occa&s;ion to &s;peak evil of us, may be a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>THIS a&s;&s;embly in general will permit me to a&s;k them their motives, in coming together at this time. Was it a wi&s;h to profit by the public ex|erci&s;es of the day? If it was, you will not loo&s;e your time, if you rightly improve the advice you have had from our worthy monitor of the day; and if you will not do this, you mu&s;t charge your lo&s;s of time to your own negligence, and not to the occa&s;ion;&mdash;Or was it mere curio&s;ity which brought you together? If it was, we wi&s;h you may be as fortunate as Zaccheus of old, who, from the &s;ame motive, climb a tree to &s;ee our common lord.</P>
<P>HERE, perhaps, &s;ome of you will inquire why, if our principles are &s;o noble, and our intentions &s;o benevolent, we do not lay open all our con|duct to the world, and not have any &s;ecrets in
<PB N="9" REF="031798_0031_0FEE727A045F9930">our meetings? In this we are not &s;ingular; Law|yers, Phy&s;icians, Merchants, and mo&s;t Mechanics, have their &s;ecrets, which they will not di&s;clo&s;e to any but &s;uch as merit them. But we have more to &s;ay: The &s;ecrets of our Craft cannot be com|municated to one who is not a Ma&s;on. Should we attempt it, our words would be thought idle tales, and we &s;hould not be believed;&mdash;that if a man wi&s;hes to learn the &s;ecrets of Free Ma&s;onry, he mu&s;t become a Ma&s;on, as otherwi&s;e he can no more under&s;tand them than a natural man can di&s;cern tho&s;e things which are only &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>SOME of you, perhaps, have imbibed an idea, that we indulge too much in mirth for our &s;ober profe&s;&s;ions: Of &s;uch I would inquire, whether the chri&s;tian, who leads a gloomy, &s;our, moro&s;e life, does more honor to his profe&s;&s;ion than he who leads a cheerful one? We follow rea&s;on, which teaches us, that the man who is plea&s;ed with his ma&s;ter, and with his &s;ervice, and feels no guilt on his con&s;cience, has the be&s;t right to be merry, and will feel the greate&s;t inclination to it. <HI>Light is &s;own for the righteous, and gladne&s;s for the up|right in heart.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="031798_0032_0FEE727CC8779E28">
SOME very captious per&s;ons may farther object to us, that we admit unworthy members. We &s;ubmit to the charge, and confe&s;s that we have not the means of &s;earching hearts, but are liable to be impo&s;ed on; but is not this the ca&s;e with all other &s;ocieties? Do not chri&s;tians of every denomination, with the &s;ublime&s;t precepts, and the brighte&s;t example ever given to man, err in the &s;ame way? When unworthy per&s;ons creep in unawares to our &s;ociety, we wi&s;h they had not been admitted.</P>
<P>MY fair hearers, who honor us with their com|pany at this time, and add &s;o much to the bril|liancy of the day, demand particular attention. Methinks I almo&s;t hear you inquire why you are not invited to partake of our plea&s;ures, and make a part of our &s;ocial meetings? It might be a&s;ked in return, why you are not cho&s;en govern|ors, councillors, &s;enators, &amp;c. but this will not &s;atisfy you; I mu&s;t therefore tell you an hone&s;t truth, which I almo&s;t blu&s;h to own, but of which you are our witne&s;&s;es; to wit, that in all fe&s;tive meetings where your &s;ex and ours join, your charms engage &s;o much of our attention, and the plea&s;ure of plea&s;ing you, &s;o entirely engro&s;&s;es the time, that no &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s is attended to; and, as it would be more mortifying to you to be in
<PB N="11" REF="031798_0033_0FEE727F96499100">our company and not the principal objects of our attention; and our meetings are for &s;erious bu&s;i|ne&s;s, though &s;oftened and enlivened by mirth and hilarity; and we mu&s;t either deny our&s;elves the plea&s;ure of your company, or neglect our mo&s;t important bu&s;ine&s;s: we prefer the former, howe|ever hard the ta&s;k; and hope you will rather commend than cen&s;ure us for &s;ometimes attend|ing to the calis of duty in preference to the al|lurements of love: e&s;pecially if at other times you find us as faithful and affectionate hu&s;bands, as ardent lovers, as kind parents, as dutiful chil|dren, as tru&s;ty friends, and in all re&s;pects as good members of &s;ociety as other men; and we flatter our&s;elves you will, on no other occa&s;ions, find us behind your warme&s;t admirers.</P>
<P>To this a&s;&s;embly, I beg leave to add;&mdash;wheth|er we can an&s;wer to univer&s;al &s;atisfaction all the objections that may be brought again&s;t us, or not; we are entitled to the &s;ame exerci&s;e of candor and charity which men in general have a right to expect from their fellow creatures, con&s;idering that the right of private judgment is unalienable, and as we have one common ma&s;ter in heaven, &s;o to him we mu&s;t, each one for him&s;elf, finally &s;tand or fall. As we all acknowledge the &s;ame rule of faith, and that rule mo&s;t &s;trongly recom|mends
<PB N="12" REF="031798_0034_0FEE72825ED2F208">that we love one another; let us, laying a&s;ide all evil &s;urmi&s;es, jealou&s;ies, and &s;u&s;picions, endeavor to conduct towards each other on the pre&s;ent &s;cene of action in &s;uch a manner, that our own hearts may not reproach us while we live; and when this drams &s;hall be clo&s;ed; this world and all things in it be di&s;&s;olved, and even the &s;olid works of Ma&s;onry be involved in the common ruin; may we, through the mercy of the great Architect of the univer&s;e, and the merit of the Grand Ma&s;ter of the chri&s;tian church, be admitted to a &s;eat in that MOUSE WHICH IS NOT MADE WITH MANDS, BUT WHOSE BUILDER AND MAKER IS GOD.</P>
