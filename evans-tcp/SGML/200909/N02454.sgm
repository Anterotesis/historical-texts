<P>AND this was the Wretched I&s;&s;ue of all the GOOD IMPRESSIONS which the Terrors of GOD had made upon them.

O! may we, on whom <HI>the End of the World is come,</HI> and who have had <HI>the&s;e things written for our Admonition,</HI> take warning from it!</P>

<P>In the particular Article we have now before us;</P>
<P>Behold, fir&s;t, a poor People under <HI>Good Im|pre&s;&s;ions</HI> in a time of <HI>Danger;</HI> and from an Appre|hen&s;ion of the Glorious GOD coming to <HI>&s;lay</HI> them. He <HI>&s;lew</HI> &s;ome of them; Yea, an Horrendous EARTHQUAKE, was the way wherein He <HI>&s;lew</HI> a Number of them. The Survivers were a while under <HI>Good Impre&s;&s;ions</HI> from &s;uch occurrences. When they were afraid, that GOD was going to <HI>&s;lay</HI> them, yea, to <HI>Damn</HI> them, for their Sins, <HI>Then</HI> they Bethought them&s;elves; <HI>Then</HI> they thought they would become the <HI>Diligent Seekers</HI> of GOD; <HI>Then</HI> they thought they would no more De&s;pi&s;e their SAVIOUR. But then,</P>
<P>Behold, next, what becomes of all the&s;e <HI>Good Impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> when the <HI>Danger</HI> &s;eems to be a little over with them. They are not <HI>Effectual</HI> ones; They are not <HI>Abiding</HI> ones; They all go off, with mi&s;erable Demon&s;trations, that their <HI>Hearts</HI> were the &s;ame they were before. They are not <HI>Sincere,</HI> and &s;o they are not <HI>&s;tedfa&s;t</HI> in the Declarations they made, when the <HI>Good Impre&s;&s;ions</HI> were upon them.

Thus it is, even among <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> as well as <HI>Egyptians.</HI> People who apprehend them&s;elves in <HI>Dangers</HI> of a deadly A&s;pect upon them, do com|monly Think and Speak many <HI>Good Things.</HI> But they do almo&s;t as commonly <HI>Forget</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Good Things,</HI> when their Apprehen&s;ions are over.

The Hebrew Name for, MAN, &s;igni|fies, <HI>Forgetful Man.</HI> I mind this Elegance and Empha&s;is, in the words of the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. VIII. 4. <HI>What is Forgetful Man, that thou Remem|bre&s;t him!</HI> O <HI>Forgetful Man,</HI> Thou &s;hewe&s;t what thou art, by nothing more than thy &s;oon <HI>Forgetting</HI> of the <HI>Good Impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> which <HI>Dangers</HI> make upon thee.</P>
<P>&para;. We will begin with a more <HI>General A&s;&s;ertion.</HI> DANGERS of all &s;orts, e&s;pecially all deadly <HI>Dan|gers,</HI> often are mo&s;t <HI>Hypocritically</HI> plaid withal. O the <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> in the <HI>Heart</HI> of Man, which is <HI>Deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked!</HI> All &s;orts of <HI>Dangers,</HI> do frequently drive People into &s;ome <HI>Sen|timents</HI> and <HI>Purpo&s;es</HI> of PIETY: But when the <HI>Dangers</HI> are over, the <HI>Sentiments</HI> are worn away, the <HI>Purpo&s;es</HI> are laid a&s;ide; the PIETY is no fur|ther pro&s;ecuted; and the <HI>Religion</HI> which was but a <HI>fla&s;h,</HI> is all forgotten.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We &s;ee, <HI>Dangers</HI> make People <HI>Devout</HI> and Serious. People u&s;e to be devoutly di&s;po&s;ed, when deadly <HI>Dangers</HI> are impending over them. <HI>Affliction</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002908_0007_0FE692FC619E1C10">and <HI>Affrightment</HI> is how often, the <HI>Mother of Devo|tion!</HI> I wi&s;h, it may not be &s;aid, a <HI>Spurious Devo|tion.</HI> Imminent and &s;en&s;ible <HI>Dangers</HI> of Death, make Men grow <HI>Thoughtful;</HI> and it will be &s;trange, if the Advance of the <HI>Leviathan</HI> do not cau&s;e them to <HI>purify them&s;elves.</HI> They whom a &s;en&s;e of <HI>Death</HI> approaching does not compel to &s;ome <HI>Sober Thoughts,</HI> what are they?

It was once expo&s;tulated with a Malefactor in the Jaws of <HI>Death:</HI> Luk. XXIII. 40. <HI>Do&s;t not thou Fear GOD, &s;eeing thou art under Condemnation?</HI> But that was a Mon&s;ter of a Man. Shall it be &s;aid of a Man, <HI>He does not Fear GOD, when he is in a Dan|ger that looks like a &s;entence of Death upon him?</HI> Verily, 'Twill be a very mon&s;trous Character.</P>
<P>We will Enquire, fir&s;t, after the <HI>Ground,</HI> then, after the <HI>Proof,</HI> of this unhappy matter.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; The <HI>Ground</HI> of it, is, A <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> excited by <HI>Dangers</HI> unto its Operations. In deadly <HI>Dangers,</HI> the <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> comes to operate. By <HI>Dangers,</HI> the Minds of Men are cha&s;ed from tho&s;e things which drown'd the Murmurs of their <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI> Yea, in <HI>Dangers,</HI> People are compelled not only to bear the <HI>Murmurs</HI> of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> but al&s;o the <HI>Whi&s;pers</HI> are turned into <HI>Thunders.</HI> There is a <HI>Preacher</HI> in the Bo&s;om of every Man; and upon <HI>Dangers,</HI> this <HI>Preacher</HI> becomes a <HI>Thunderer.</HI></P>
<P>There are Three Things, which the <HI>Thundering Voice</HI> of CONSCIENCE will &s;peak to People, when <HI>deadly Dangers</HI> are upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="002908_0007_0FE692FC619E1C10">
One Admonition of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> is This; O Man, There is the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD in the <HI>Dangers</HI> that have now overtaken thee. <HI>Dangers</HI> don't come, nor &s;o much as a <HI>little Bird</HI> fall into them, without the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD. There is the Hand of GOD, in all the <HI>Dangers</HI> that are brought upon thee. GOD has taken thee into his Hand, when be thus brings <HI>Dangers</HI> upon thee. <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> now &s;ub&s;cribes to That; Amos III. 6. <HI>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it!</HI> O Thou expo&s;ed one, GOD is the <HI>Doer,</HI> in all the <HI>Evil</HI> that is hanging over thee.</P>
<P>A Second Admonition of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> is This: 'Tis a GOD <HI>offended</HI> by thy <HI>Sin,</HI> who &s;ends thy <HI>Dangers</HI> upon thee. Thou art a <HI>Sinner.</HI> Thy <HI>Sin</HI> has been an <HI>Offence</HI> unto GOD; Thy <HI>Sin</HI> makes thee obnoxious unto the <HI>Anger</HI> of GOD; lays thee open unto the <HI>Vengeance</HI> of GOD. It is a Thing of the greate&s;t Importance, that the <HI>Di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> of GOD, &s;hould not remain burning again&s;t thee; A di&s;plea&s;ed GOD is an Adver&s;ary, which &mdash; <HI>how can thy Hands be &s;trong, or how can thy Heart endure,</HI> to encounter with Him <HI>&verbar; Con&s;cience</HI> now &s;ub&s;cribes to Thee; Prov. XIII. 21. <HI>Evil pur&s;ueth Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>A Third Admonition of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> is This: REPENTANCE, REPENTANCE! <HI>That</HI> is the mo&s;t likely way to e&s;cape thy <HI>Dangers.</HI> O <HI>wicked</HI> one, <HI>For&s;ake</HI> thy <HI>ways;</HI> O <HI>unju&s;t</HI> one, <HI>For&s;ake</HI> thy <HI>Thoughts; Return to the Lord, and He will have mercy!</HI> If thou <HI>Repente&s;t not,</HI> thou may&s;t Fear, that the <HI>Arrows prepared</HI> on the <HI>bent Bowe</HI> of GOD, will be let fly upon thee. The Language of <HI>Con|&s;cience</HI> now is That; Jon. III. 8, 9. <HI>Turn every one from his evil way, &mdash; who can tell, but GOD
<PB N="10" REF="002908_0008_0FE6930D68096B90">may turn away from His fierce Anger, that we peri&s;h not.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> begins to <HI>Thunder</HI> at this rate, and make a Noi&s;e like the hideous Rumblings of an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> it mu&s;t needs throw the Threa|tened People into &s;ome <HI>Religious</HI> Di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>As a <HI>Supplement</HI> unto this Meditation, let this be added. The Glorious GOD throws Men into <HI>Dangers</HI> on this very <HI>De&s;ign;</HI> To make them hear|ken unto what He &s;peaks by the Mouth of His Deputy, their <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> to them. Truly, Syrs, this is the very <HI>Errand</HI> that your <HI>Dangers</HI> are &s;ent upon. The <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> in Man, may complain, as in Jer. XXII. 21. <HI>I &s;pake unto thee in thy pre&s;perity; But thou &s;aid&s;t, I will not hear.</HI> Men are Deaf to <HI>Con&s;cience;</HI> It Groans, it Cries, it Thunders, and they do not regard it. GOD now does ca&s;t Men into <HI>Dangers</HI> on this Intent; <HI>Man, Hear now, what thy Con&s;cience has to &s;ay unto thee: It has a Me&s;&s;age from GOD to thee!</HI> From this it is, that Men &s;o <HI>&s;eem to be Religious,</HI> when <HI>Dangers</HI> are upon them.</P>
<P>Secondly; The <HI>Proof</HI> of it; For this we will repair unto <HI>Experience.</HI> And, <HI>Hear this, O all ye People, every one of you:</HI> May we not &s;ay, 'Tis <HI>your own Experience.</HI> The <HI>Scripture</HI> tells us, of &s;ome; I&s;a. XXVI. 16. <HI>Lord, In Trouble have they vi&s;ited thee; they poured out a Prayer, when thy Cha&s;tening was upon them.</HI> Yea, but our <HI>Experience</HI> will every day tell us, <HI>Lord,</HI> How many are they, who when they are <HI>afraid of Trouble,</HI> do &s;ay, <HI>They will vi&s;it GOD every day as long as they live!</HI> How many are they who <HI>pour out a Prayer,</HI> when <HI>Danger</HI> is up|on them! O that the Sermon of this Day, might be a <HI>Sermon to bring unto Remembrance!</HI> How ma|ny,
<PB N="11" REF="002908_0008_0FE6930D68096B90">O our dear People, How many of you, may <HI>Remember</HI> the <HI>Dangers,</HI> wherein you were at that pa&s;s; Jer. II. 20. <HI>Thou &s;aid&s;t, I will not Tran&s;gre&s;s! Remember</HI> you not, what you &s;aid, when you lay <HI>Sick,</HI> and like to <HI>Die</HI> of your Sickne&s;s, and pale <HI>Death</HI> look'd you in the Face, and you look'd on your&s;elves as <HI>deprived of the Re&s;idue of your years,</HI> and Summoned before the Tribunal of GOD? <HI>Then</HI> you &s;aid, <HI>Oh! If GOD will &s;pare my life, I will do nothing but &s;erve the GOD of my life: I will hate and loathe and &s;hun all the Sin that once I loved; and lead a life of all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty! Remember</HI> you not, what you &s;aid, when a <HI>Storm</HI> at Sea had almo&s;t &s;wallowed you up, and you were ca&s;t into Horror, by the <HI>Horrible Tempe&s;t;</HI> Your <HI>Soul</HI> was <HI>melted becau&s;e of Trouble;</HI> You &s;aw your&s;elves going down into the <HI>deep Waters;</HI> You fear'd you were going down into the <HI>Eternal Burnings? Then</HI> you &s;aid; <HI>Oh! If GOD will plea&s;e, that I may out-live this Death, I will never Sin again&s;t Him any more as heretofore! I will do nothing that may render my Death unea&s;y and unwelcome to me!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Memorandums</HI> are not over yet. My Friend, <HI>Remember</HI> you not, what you &s;aid, when you were in the <HI>Land</HI> and the <HI>Hand</HI> of your <HI>Enemies;</HI> you <HI>&s;at in Darkne&s;s,</HI> and in the <HI>&s;hadow of Death;</HI> and you had little Hope of ever being again in the Arms of tho&s;e, who were now <HI>put far from</HI> you? <HI>Then</HI> you Cried unto the Lord; and you &s;aid; <HI>Oh! If the Lord will Re&s;tore me to my Liberty, with what an Enlarged Heart &s;hall I run the way of His Command|ments.</HI></P>
<P>And will the Daughters of <HI>Eve</HI> give me leave to be a <HI>Remembrancer</HI> unto Them? When the
<PB N="12" REF="002908_0009_0FE6930D86D51D70">Time of your <HI>Travail</HI> and your <HI>Trouble,</HI> and the <HI>perils of Child bearing</HI> drew near, and you conceived your&s;elves entring the <HI>Valley of the &s;hadow of Death,</HI> You <HI>Then</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Behold, The Handmaid of the Lord! If the Lord carry me to and thro' my Time, I will for|ever behave my &s;elf as becomes an Handmaid of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, Do you Remember nothing of what you thought when you &s;elf the Earth trembling and rumbling in a tremendous <HI>Earthquake</HI> under you? Did not your <HI>Hearts</HI> then <HI>&s;mite</HI> you for your keeping at a di&s;tance from your SAVIOUR; and for the various Mi&s;carriages of an ungodly and unrighteous Life? And was it not the purpo&s;e of your Hearts, <HI>I will not offend any more?</HI></P>
<P>If you don't <HI>Remember</HI> what you &s;aid, GOD <HI>Remembers</HI> it; it is all down in the <HI>Book of His Remembrance.</HI> Perhaps, New <HI>Dangers</HI> and Sor|rows are coming upon you, to bring it unto your own <HI>Remembrance; In the latter Days ye &s;hall con|&s;ider it!</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t now pa&s;s on to a Second Remark. But, one that <HI>is a Lamentation, and &s;hall be for a Lamen|tation.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; Men u&s;e quickly to <HI>Forget</HI> how <HI>De|vout</HI> they were, when their <HI>Dangers</HI> were upon them. T'was all but a <HI>Religious Pang.</HI> Ah, De|ceitful <HI>Pang!</HI> like the <HI>Morning Cloud,</HI> and the <HI>Early Dew; It pa&s;&s;es away.</HI> We read of &s;ome, P&s;al. CVI. 13. <HI>They &s;oon forgot His Works.</HI> Even &s;o, Men <HI>&s;oon Forget</HI> what <HI>workings</HI> they had in their own Hearts, when they &s;aw the <HI>Hand of GOD lifted up to &s;mite them.</HI></P>

When our SAVIOUR was in the <HI>Temple,</HI> the Hearers that were <HI>Convicted in their own Con&s;cience</HI> by what He &s;aid, <HI>Went out,</HI> and, <HI>Lo, He was left alone.</HI> Oh, How far, <HI>how far!</HI> &mdash; would it go towards break|ing up the Congregation, if all &s;hould <HI>go out,</HI> who may be <HI>convicted in their own Con&s;cience,</HI> that they do not live, as under the <HI>Terrors</HI> of GOD, they &s;aid, They would. A great Man once putting that Ca&s;e to a good Man, <HI>How &s;hall I order my life, that I may glorify GOD?</HI> He only gave him this An&s;wer; <HI>Live as when you lately apprehended your &s;elf a dying, you thought you would live, if GOD would let you live.</HI> There are many who do not <HI>glorify GOD.</HI> And we may conclude, They don't <HI>live,</HI> as in their <HI>Dangers,</HI> they &s;aid, <HI>They would.</HI> Where one is <HI>Reformed,</HI> a Thou&s;and are <HI>as they were!</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>whence does this come to pa&s;s?</HI> 'Tis, From the <HI>Spirit of the Old Covenant</HI> in Mens Inclinations and Re&s;olutions.

The SPIRIT of GOD has not yet <HI>Internally Changed</HI> the <HI>Bia&s;s</HI> of their Minds: The <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> yet reigning in their Hearts is not extingui&s;hed.

<P>From this Remark on <HI>Thunders,</HI> I return to <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> which are of the &s;ame Family with them: And, my Remark upon them is, That it is very plain, the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> which have lately &s;hook the <HI>Earth</HI> under us for many Hundreds of Miles, and which in many places have been con|tinued for diver&s;e Weeks together, have produced very <HI>Good Impre&s;&s;ions</HI> on many Thou&s;ands of Minds.

They that now had no Awe upon them, and no Sen&s;e of a Glorious GOD and their Duty to Him, and felt no <HI>Good Impre&s;&s;ions</HI> on their Minds, what &s;hall be thought of them! &mdash; I &s;uppo&s;e, there were very few &s;uch <HI>Mon&s;ters</HI> to be &s;een, in our Land.

<P>We read concerning Two Mini&s;ters, upon whom our Lord put the Name of BOANERGES. The Name will &s;ignify, <HI>Sons of Earthquake,</HI> as well as what we commonly take it, <HI>Of Thunder.</HI> Our Lord in impo&s;ing that Name on the&s;e two Mini|&s;ters, might have Re&s;pect unto that Prophecy, <HI>I will &s;hake all Nations, and the de&s;ire of all Nations &s;hall come.</HI> The&s;e Mini&s;ters might have a Notable Delivery, as <HI>Nazianzen</HI> intimates, by the Advan|tage whereof what they delivered might come like <HI>Thunder</HI> on the Hearers. But this is not all; There were to be mighty <HI>Commotions</HI> even like tho&s;e of an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> in &s;ub&s;erviency to the Intere&s;ts of the Go&s;pel; and our Lord would make a &s;ingular u&s;e of the&s;e Mini&s;ters in tho&s;e <HI>Commotions;</HI> who were to carry the Go&s;pel with a Force like that of <HI>Thunder</HI> al&s;o, thro' the Jewi&s;h Nation.</P>

<P>At the Time of the Battel between tho&s;e two Grand Robbers, which were di&s;puting the Em|pire of the World, there was a <HI>Great Earthquake:</HI> But the <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of the Battel &s;o engaged the com|batants, that they took not the lea&s;t Notice of it.

<HEAD>I. The Fir&s;t OBSERVABLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Occurring of EARTHQUAKES in DIVERS PLACES, is what our SAVI|OUR has advi&s;ed us to con&s;ider of. Truly, In <HI>this Year</HI> of NEW-ENGLAND's <HI>Trembling,</HI> there are occurring EARTHQUAKES in DIVERS PLACES. If the jogs given to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain,</HI> do little to row&s;e the <HI>Europaean</HI> World from the Lethargy of the <HI>la&s;t Time,</HI> yet it may be hoped &s;ome in <HI>America</HI> may <HI>hear Attentively the Noi&s;e of the Voice of GOD</HI> in them, and the <HI>Sound that goes out of His Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>In our coming to relate the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> of <HI>this Year,</HI> it may not be ami&s;s, but be a decent Introducti|on, to relate, that &s;o lately, as a little above a Year
<PB N="47" REF="002908_0026_0FE693CDDE6664F8">ago, in the Night between the fir&s;t and &s;econd of <HI>September,</HI> between the Hours of Ten and Eleven, the City of <HI>Palermo</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> felt &s;ome &s;hocks, of an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> which were not at fir&s;t very Vio|lent. But they &s;oon increa&s;ed with great Fury for above Twenty Minutes; whereby about a quarter part of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reat City, was overturn'd &amp; overwhelm'd, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ade an Heap of amazing Rubbi&s;h: From whence <HI>Three Thou&s;and of the Dead,</HI> were draw out, five days after, fearfully cru&s;h'd and ma&s;h'd, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">erably broken to pieces. In one Ward of the City, a whole <HI>Street</HI> gaped at once with an hideous and horrid Noi&s;e; and from the Cha&s;m, there i&s;&s;ued out <HI>Flames,</HI> which were mixed with calcined Stones, and a Torrent of <HI>Burning Brim&s;tone,</HI> whereby in le&s;s than half an Hour, the whole Waid was con&s;umed. It was computed, that about <HI>Fifteen Thou&s;and</HI> People pe|ri&s;hed in this De&s;olation. But <HI>This Year</HI> is what we are now confin'd unto. We are informed that in the Month of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, they had &s;everal Shocks of an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> at <HI>Arles,</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and one &s;o Violent, that all the Inhabitants ran out of the City, for fear of being overwhelmed under the Ruines of their Hou&s;es, and continued en|camped in the open Countrey, till they hoped the Danger was over. Some of the Shocks were more Violent about <HI>Languedoc,</HI> than at <HI>Arles.</HI></P>
<P>Our Accounts from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> inform us, That on the Nineteenth of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, there were <HI>Earthquakes</HI> felt at <HI>Swanzy,</HI> before which there was heard a mighty Noi&s;e, like that of <HI>Thunder</HI> at a Di&s;tance. The Hou&s;es trembled; The Walls of Gardens rocqued; The tops of Chimneys fell;

<P>About <HI>Exeter,</HI> they had the <HI>Earthquake</HI> which gave dreadful Concu&s;&s;ions; People could not &s;tand when they felt it; It rang the Bells in the Sceeples; And &s;ome Damage was done by it.

<P>The Relation from <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> is yet more Expre&s;|&s;ive. <Q>On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the <HI>Nineteenth</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> a lit|tle after Four in the Morning, we had a mo&s;t terrible <HI>Earthquake.</HI> They that were in the Field, and heard it coming (as they &s;ay, from the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI>) could not tell what to liken it to, but to Great Guns, firing under Ground, or &s;ome terrible Thunder. The Hedges and Trees &s;eemed to walk, or move from their Places; The Birds flew out from thence, as if they were frighted; The Walls of the Park and Gardens [at <HI>Margam</HI>] were &s;hook down; The Doors of the Church, and of &s;everal Hou&s;es flew open, tho' Lock'd and Bolted. The Bells tolled of them&s;elves; &s;e|veral Stacks of Chimneys were thrown down. Hou&s;es untiled; Windows and Shutters broken.

<HEAD>The Second OBSERVABLE.</HEAD>
<P>We &s;oon knew, that our EARTHQUAKE ex|tended more than <HI>Five Hundred Miles.</HI> But &s;hall we reckon it a part of <HI>ours,</HI> if we find an EARTH|QUAKE within a Day or Two before <HI>ours</HI> affect|ing the <HI>Caribbee-I&s;lands?</HI> Reader, Con&s;ider what we are going to Relate, and think, with a ju&s;t Reflection, How deep the <HI>Fires</HI> may ly, which may give &s;o near <HI>Simultaneous Agitations,</HI> to the Tottering Arch which is our only <HI>Foundation;</HI> [if we have no &s;hare in the <HI>City</HI> that has better <HI>Foun|dations!</HI>] and what a mighty Force they may a|non exert upon it!</P>
<P>We have Advice, that the <HI>Earthquake</HI> we had here; (if it may be &s;aid &s;o) Oct. 29. between Ten and Eleven in the Evening, was felt at <HI>Barbados</HI> the Day before, about <HI>Noon;</HI> which is near <HI>two Thou&s;and Miles</HI> di&s;tant from us; And much after the manner we had it here. The <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> were in a very frightful Convul&s;ion; The <HI>Streets</HI> ro&s;e and fell, even like the <HI>Waves</HI> of the Sea; The People in utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation from an Apprehen&s;ion that the Earth might &s;ink under them, ran to the Wharfe, that they might get into Ve&s;&s;els for their &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB REF="002908_0028_0FE693D8DD03C3D0">
We have Advice al&s;o, that <HI>Martineco,</HI> A Day or two before the Time of our <HI>Earthquake,</HI> underwent a more terrible one than that of <HI>Bar|bados,</HI> or, that of <HI>New-England.</HI> Their <HI>Temple</HI> and their <HI>Pri&s;on</HI> were thrown down; and many of their <HI>Sugar-works</HI> ruined; and their Negros kill'd. The <HI>Noi&s;e</HI> as well as the <HI>Shock,</HI> was beyond Ex|pre&s;&s;ion hideous; They that have arrived from thence unto us, di&s;cover an <HI>Abiding Horror,</HI> at what they heard and felt and &s;aw, in what they are e&s;caped from.</P>
<P>It may be added, That &s;ome of our Ve&s;&s;els, which were at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance from us, in the mid&s;t of the <HI>Huge</HI> and <HI>Wide Atlantic,</HI> at the Time of our <HI>Earthquake</HI> were <HI>vi&s;ited</HI> with &s;uch <HI>Thunder,</HI> as they had &s;carce ever known to be pa|rallel'd.</P>

<HEAD>III. The Third OBSERVABLE.</HEAD>
<P>There was <HI>This Year,</HI> a very &s;trange occurrence in <HI>Ireland;</HI> which drew as in <HI>Miniature</HI> a mo&s;t <HI>lively Emblem,</HI> of what it is that EARTH|QUAKES come for; and of the Condition and Confu&s;ion which falls upon <HI>For&s;aken Sinners,</HI> when held in the <HI>Cords</HI> of their <HI>Sins,</HI> and fiez'd by the Ir|re&s;i&s;tible Vengeance of Heaven.

<P>On the Fourteenth of the la&s;t <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> (1727.) as one <HI>John Byrn,</HI> a Wretch of a very Di&s;&s;olute and Abandoned Life, &s;tood at the Gallows in <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> with a Rope about his Neck, in order to be executed for the Murder of one Mr. <HI>Taylor,</HI>

It was look'd on as an amazing Expre&s;&s;ion of the Divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, and the <HI>Wrath of GOD reveal'd from Heaven,</HI> a|gain&s;t the Crimes of &s;o horrible and obdura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a Criminal.

<P>Our EARTHQUAKES unavoidably lead us to the Con&s;ideration, of what is to be expected from the <HI>Subterraneous Fires,</HI> in the <HI>Day of the Lord that &s;hall burn like an Oven;</HI> when they &s;hall con|&s;pire with the <HI>Fires,</HI> which at the <HI>Glorious Appear|ing of our great GOD and SAVIOUR,</HI> &s;hall fill and clean&s;e the <HI>Heavens,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>High places</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re now occupied by <HI>Wicked Spirits.</HI> When <HI>the Lord our GOD &s;hall come,</HI> and <HI>a Fire &s;hall devour be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore Him, and it &s;hall be very Tempe&s;tuous round about Him,</HI> Then the <HI>Fire and Brim&s;tone</HI> which will in an <HI>Horrible Tempe&s;t</HI> be <HI>Rained</HI> like <HI>Snares,</HI> upon the <HI>wicked,</HI> even upon all but tho&s;e Holy and Humble <HI>Walkers with GOD,</HI> that &s;hall have His <HI>Mark</HI> upon
