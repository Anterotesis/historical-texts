<P>_HAVING given the proper Direction at the Head of his Letter to his Friend <HI>Gaius,</HI> the Apo&s;tle proceeds to &s;alute him in the Lord, and utters a pathetick Wi&s;h on his Behalf, as in our Text. This affectionate Comprecation is vari|ou&s;ly under&s;tood by Expo&s;itors.</P>
<P>Some take it as a Wi&s;h for his Recovery of <HI>bodily Health;</HI> making the Pro&s;perity of his <HI>Soul</HI> (which is here acknowledg'd) the Rule and Standard of that. And in this View of the Words, we might note from them, That &s;uch as have <HI>pro&s;perous Souls</HI> may neverthele&s;s have <HI>&s;ickly</HI> and <HI>afflicted Bodies:</HI> And for the weakly and &s;ick Servants of Chri&s;t, we &s;hould wi&s;h their Recovery of <HI>Health,</HI> as the greate&s;t outward Ble&s;&s;ing: And finally, it's a <HI>rare</HI> and <HI>admirable</HI> Ca&s;e, when any one is vi&s;ibly &s;o ble&s;&s;ed in Spirituals, as that we may venture to make the Mea&s;ure of his <HI>Soul-Pro&s;perity</HI> the Rule of our Wi&s;hes for his <HI>bodily Health.</HI> Ala&s;s, what Multitudes are there of neglected and unpro&s;pering Souls, even among Go&s;|pel-Profe&s;&s;ors,

whether &s;ick or well in Body! And as for &s;uch, to make the Apo&s;tle's Wi&s;h in this Sen&s;e, wou'd be a cur&s;ing, rather than ble&s;&s;ing them, and wou'd imply a wi&s;hing them undone for both Worlds, mi&s;erable both in Body and Soul.&mdash;But I &s;hall not con|&s;ider the Text in this Light at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Others take it as a Wi&s;h for the Health and Pro&s;perity of his <HI>Soul.</HI> And con&s;idering it in this View, the fol|lowing Ob&s;ervations may be made from it.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is &s;uch a Thing as the <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> and <HI>Health of the Soul.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Soul-Pro&s;perity and Health is the <HI>be&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> we can wi&s;h to any.</P>
<P N="3">3. The mo&s;t healthy and pro&s;perous Soul is capable of &s;till <HI>further Improvements;</HI> and accordingly (whatever we wi&s;h any one) an Increa&s;e of &s;piritual Pro&s;perity and Health is <HI>above all Things</HI> to be wi&s;hed for him.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE I. <HI>There is &s;uch a Thing as the Pro&s;perity and Health of the Soul.</HI>&mdash;The Apo&s;tle a&s;cribes it to his well-beloved <HI>Gaius;</HI> Even as <HI>thy Soul pro&s;pereth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall briefly premi&s;e &s;ome Hints upon the <HI>Subject</HI> of this Pro&s;perity and Health, the <HI>Soul</HI> of Man.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004954_0004_100E461757F98708">We read, <HI>Job</HI> 32.8. <HI>There is a Spirit in Man; and the In&s;piration of the Almighty giveth them Under&s;tanding.</HI> The Scriptures every where &s;uppo&s;e Man a Compound of Matter and Spirit. The Soul is an intelligent and undying Principle within us; a &s;piritual invi&s;ible think|ing Sub&s;tance, di&s;tinct from our material and animal Part; &s;urvives the Body, and has an eternal Exi&s;tence. [See <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12.7. and <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.28.] Hence holy <HI>Paul</HI> de&s;ired to <HI>depart,</HI> that he might <HI>be with Chri&s;t,</HI> that is, in his immortal Spirit. (<HI>Phil.</HI> 1.23.) When the Man <HI>Je&s;us</HI> felt his Body di&s;&s;olving, he <HI>committed his Spirit</HI> into his Father's Hand, and <HI>gave up the Gho&s;t. (Luke</HI> 23.46.) So dying <HI>Stephen</HI> went out of the World calling upon the Lord <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to <HI>receive his Spirit. (Acts</HI> 7.59.) &mdash;What are the <HI>Spirits in Pri&s;on</HI> (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.19.) but Souls of wicked Men departed this Life, and doom'd to a State of Mi&s;ery in the other World? And what are <HI>the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect</HI> (Heb. 12.23.) but the Souls of Believers di&s;charg'd from the Incumbrance of their Clay-Tabernacles, and pa&s;&s;ed into Glory? &mdash; In a Word, what are <HI>we</HI> that dwell on the Face of the Earth, but Spirits that <HI>abide in the Fle&s;h?</HI> (Phil. 1.24.) Hence the LORD is &s;tiled <HI>the God of the Spirits of all Fle&s;h.</HI> (Num. 27.16.) He is &s;o, as he <HI>formeth the Spirit of Man within him</HI> (Zech. 12.1.) and as <HI>his Vi&s;itation pre&s;erveth our Spirit.</HI> (Job. 10.12.)</P>
<P>O let us all remember, and carry the Thought about with us continually, that we have <HI>Souls,</HI> as well as Bodies: <HI>Souls</HI> un&s;peakably preferrible to our Bodies; <HI>Souls, the Redemption whereof is precious</HI> (P&s;al. 49.8.) <HI>Souls, the Salvation</HI> whereof is the <HI>End of our Faith</HI> (1 Pet. 1.9.) And <HI>Souls,</HI> the <HI>keeping</HI> whereof we mu&s;t daily <HI>commit to God, as to a faithful Creator, in well-doing</HI> (1 Pet. 4.19.) Not caring for the Things of the World, what we &s;hall eat or drink, or wherewith be cloathed, but <HI>caring for the Things of the Lord, that we may be holy both in Body and Spirit</HI> (1 Cor. 7.34.) That we may <HI>glorify God in
<PB N="4" REF="004954_0005_100E461982D5BD10">
our Body, and in our Spirit, which are God's</HI> (1 Cor. 6.20.) <HI>As Strangers and Pilgrims, ab&s;taining from fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t the Soul;</HI> and <HI>living unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as tho&s;e who <HI>were as Sheep going a&s;tray, but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of our Souls.</HI> (1 Pet. 2.11, 25.)</P>
<P>O my Brethren, the SOUL is the Man. God the Father of Spirits, he weigheth the Spirits, and judgeth of you by the hidden Man of the Heart. You ought al&s;o to judge of your&s;elves by this; and if you wou'd know what Manner of Per&s;ons you are, you mu&s;t la|bour to know what Manner of Spirit you are of.&mdash;You mu&s;t take Heed to your Spirit, denominate your&s;elves from this, and make this your principal Care. O let not the Fle&s;h and the World have the A&s;cendant in your E&s;teem, and the Throne in your Hearts. Let not your Soul lie neglected, and bury'd in the Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e, or the Cares of this Life. <HI>What is a Man profited, if he gain the whole World, and lo&s;e his Soul? Or what &s;hall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</HI> (Matth. 16.26.) Learn, I be&s;eech you (my Friends) every one of you, to place a ju&s;t Value upon your immortal Part, and to make your <HI>Soul</HI> your Care in the fir&s;t Place. Think often and think &s;olemnly, that you have a <HI>Soul</HI> made for Immortality, bound to an eternal World, and which in a little Time mu&s;t be con&s;ign'd to an unalterable State of Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery. And can any of you bear the Thought of going to Hell, or mi&s;&s;ing of Heaven at la&s;t! O &s;ee your Danger, and don't <HI>de&s;troy your own Soul.</HI> Reali&s;e the Nece&s;&s;ity of caring for your <HI>Soul;</HI> and look that you do not <HI>reward Evil to your&s;elves,</HI> thro' Pre&s;umption or De&s;pair. Tremble to think what <HI>Indignation</HI> &amp; <HI>Wrath, Tribulation</HI> &amp; <HI>Angui&s;h</HI> &s;hall be upon <HI>every Soul of Man that doeth Evil.</HI> But remember, that <HI>the Soul of the Righteous</HI> &s;hall inherit <HI>Glory, Honour</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> everla&s;ting. And altho' you may &s;ome of you be without any pre&s;ent Grounds for Hope of this, as having in you &s;till <HI>the Soul of the
<PB N="5" REF="004954_0006_100E461CAD6FF928">
Wicked,</HI> an evil Heart of Unbelief; yet thro' the Riches of divine Grace there's a Po&s;&s;ibility of getting your <HI>Soul re&s;tored</HI> to Life, yea, to Health and Pro&s;perity by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Tho' your Soul be in a State of Perdition, yet not &s;uch as that of the Spirits in Pri&s;on. No, while the God of all Patience reprieves you from Hell, you ought to look on it as po&s;&s;ible for you to e&s;cape the Wrath to come; po&s;&s;ible for you to be born from above, and &s;o to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. You have a <HI>Soul,</HI> tho' &s;piritually <HI>dead,</HI> yet capable of being rai&s;ed into im|mortal Life by the Power of God, and of being made a <HI>Ve&s;&s;el of Mercy, prepared for Glory;</HI> yea, capable of a ble&s;&s;ed Pro&s;perity and Health in the pre&s;ent World, a &s;piritual Health and Pro&s;perity, which is the Beginning and Earne&s;t of everla&s;ting Glory and Felicity.</P>
<P>This leads us,</P>
<P N="2">2. To con&s;ider that <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> and <HI>Health,</HI> mention'd in our Text, as what the <HI>Soul</HI> is the Subject of.</P>
<P>Now if we view the Soul of Man in it's <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> Notion only, it may be &s;aid to pro&s;per and be in Health, when the <HI>Intellectuals</HI> are not in a di&s;eas'd infirm E&s;tate, but &s;ound, regular and vigorous as to the common Ope|rations of Rea&s;on; the Wit &s;harp, the Judgment &s;olid, the Memory tenacious, Ideas clear, and Arguings &s;trong, Knowledge increa&s;ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;But this State of the human Under&s;tanding is common to Saints and Sinners; is but a partial and very defective, low Kind of Soul-Pro&s;perity, and capable of exi&s;ting &s;eparate from that intended in our Text. It may be called indeed rather the Health of the <HI>Brain,</HI> than of the Soul; at lea&s;t it depends imme|diately upon the happy Texture of the Brain, a regular Circulation of the nervous Fluids, and Freedom of the animal Spirits, producing a lively Imagination, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the intellectual Functions.</P>
<P>But the Apo&s;tle in our Text had a more exalted View, and wou'd be under&s;tood in a <HI>theological</HI> Sen&s;e. The <HI>Pro&s;perity and Health of Soul,</HI> which he &s;peaks of, is of a &s;ublime and &s;piritual Nature, not merely intellectual, but moral; and refers not &s;o much to an orderly State of the
<PB N="6" REF="004954_0007_100E462066110E60">
<HI>Head,</HI> con&s;idering Man merely as rational and &s;ocial; but to the holy Frame of his <HI>Heart,</HI> his Con&s;cience, Will and Affections, as well as Under&s;tanding, con&s;idering him in his Relation to GOD, as a Subject of moral Govern|ment, a Creature formed for religious Service, and de|&s;ign'd for the glorifying and enjoying of God, his ulti|mate End.</P>
<P>Looking at Man in this Light, his <HI>Soul</HI> may be &s;aid to <HI>pro&s;per</HI> and be in <HI>in Health,</HI> when his Powers as a moral Agent are reduc'd under a proper Regulation, and duly exerci&s;ed on their re&s;pective Objects; &s;o as that the <HI>Soul</HI> truly an&s;wers the End of its Being, and enjoys that inward moral and &s;piritual Happine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was originally de&s;igned for. There is &s;uch a Thing as Pro&s;perity and Health of the Soul in this Sen&s;e, actually exi&s;tent in the Life which now is, tho' too uncommon.</P>
<P>Indeed con&s;idered as taking Place in the pre&s;ent World, it is not to be under&s;tood in a &s;trict and ab&s;olute Sen&s;e, as if any Souls dwelling in Fle&s;h had already attained, or cou'd attain a proper (legal) <HI>Perfection</HI> of Holine&s;s and moral Happine&s;s, exclu&s;ive of all Mixtures, and free from all Defects. For even in&s;pir'd Prophets and Apo&s;tles renounc'd all Preten&s;ions to this; as you may read both in the old Te&s;tament and New. [<HI>Eccl.</HI> 7.20. <HI>Prov.</HI> 20.9.&mdash;<HI>Phil.</HI> 3.12, 13.&mdash;1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.9, 10.&mdash; 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.8.]</P>
<P>Verily, &s;ince the Day of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, there never was an Example of complete unblemi&s;h'd Sanctity, or indefective moral Felicity; &s;ave only the Man <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> who being conceived in a miraculous Way, by the Power of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> was exempt from the common Contagion of original Sin, and his Life (in Corre&s;pondence to his innocent Nature) <HI>holy, harmle&s;s, and undefiled.</HI> But excepting this &s;ingle In&s;tance, never was Man upon Earth who&s;e <HI>Soul</HI> enjoy'd <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> and moral <HI>Health</HI> in a &s;trict Perfection. This is re&s;erved for the peculiar Priviledge of the coming World. And the <HI>Saints in the Earth,</HI> the mo&s;t excellent of them, mu&s;t be
<PB N="7" REF="004954_0008_100E4623D8088EB0">
&s;aid to be in an unpro&s;perous unhealthy State of Soul, compar'd with the perfected Spirits in <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>However, there is a Sen&s;e, a lax and le&s;s proper Sen&s;e, in which &s;ome Souls &s;till tabernacling in mortal Bodies of Fle&s;h and Blood, may be &s;aid to <HI>pro&s;per</HI> and be <HI>in Health.</HI></P>
<P>I wou'd ob&s;erve here di&s;tinctly,</P>
<P N="1">1. In a <HI>comparative</HI> Light, as viewed in Contradi&s;tinction to <HI>unregenerate</HI> Sinners, all that are <HI>born again</HI> may be &s;aid to have <HI>Souls pro&s;pering</HI> and <HI>in Health.</HI></P>
<P>The Righteous are repre&s;ented as a <HI>peculiar People,</HI> a <HI>cho&s;en Generation;</HI> who&s;e &s;piritual State, moral Endow|ments, Soul-Privileges and Relations are all &s;uch as &s;peak them <HI>the excellent in the Earth, more excellent</HI> than others. (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> 16.3. <HI>Prov.</HI> 12.26.) The <HI>Ungodly</HI> are Strangers to tho&s;e &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, which righteous Souls enjoy. They may pro&s;per in the World, heap up Riches, and &s;wim in &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, po&s;&s;e&s;s uninterrupted Health of Body, yea, and very improv'd Intellectuals too: But &s;till their <HI>Souls</HI> do not <HI>pro&s;per,</HI> in the Sen&s;e of our Text; no, their Souls are <HI>lean from Day to Day,</HI> in a &s;tarving pining peri&s;hing Condition.&mdash;Whereas now the <HI>Godly</HI> are &s;uch as have been <HI>born again, born of God,</HI> begotten to a new, a divine and heavenly Life; and have Meat to eat, which the World knows nothing of, whereby the divine Life is &s;upported and nouri&s;h'd in them.</P>
<P>A regenerating Change indeed is the <HI>fundamental</HI> Thing. True Pro&s;perity and Health of Soul implies an habitual State of moral Rectitude, re&s;tor'd to the Soul in the new Birth. <HI>Health</HI> pre&s;uppo&s;es <HI>Life:</HI> This is as the Foundation, and that as the Super&s;tructure. Spiritual Life is the radical Principle; which the Soul mu&s;t have put into it by the creating Hand of God, or it can never be &s;aid to <HI>pro&s;per</HI> and be <HI>in Health.</HI> The Man in this happy Ca&s;e is one whom <HI>the Law of the Spirit of Life, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, hath made free from the Law of Sin and Death,</HI> in &s;uch a Mea&s;ure, as that his <HI>Soul</HI> may be &s;aid truly to be <HI>alive unto God,</HI> to <HI>live in the Spirit,</HI> and to <HI>walk, not after the Fle&s;h, but after the Spirit.</HI> He is no longer
<PB N="8" REF="004954_0009_100E462939E365A0">
<HI>carnally minded,</HI> which to be is <HI>Death;</HI> but <HI>&s;piritually minded,</HI> which is <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P>The holy Scriptures, concurrent with the Experience and Ob&s;ervation of all Ages, do repre&s;ent Mankind as in a <HI>fallen</HI> Condition; their Souls mi&s;erably out of Order, infeebled, deprav'd, and corrupted in all their Powers; &s;o far from Health and Pro&s;perity, that they are by Nature even <HI>dead in Sins.</HI> Indeed Man was at fir&s;t form'd after the <HI>Image of God,</HI> in every Faculty po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an excellent Rectitude. (<HI>Gen.</HI> 1.27. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 7.29.) But by &s;inning again&s;t God, our fir&s;t Parents fell from the E&s;tate, wherein they were created; and all <HI>Adam</HI>'s natural Po&s;terity, being not only in his Loins, but included in the Covenant made with him, and &s;o involv'd in the common Guilt of the fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, do ju&s;tly inherit the Pollution contracted and the Mi&s;ery incur'd by his Apo&s;ta&s;y. (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> 58.3. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12, 19.)</P>
<P>But, ble&s;&s;ed be the God of all Grace, who in his infinite Wi&s;dom and Mercy has found out an admirable Expedient for our Recovery, and in the Fulne&s;s of Time &s;ent his Son, incarnate in human Nature, to &s;ave his People from their Sins. He was <HI>wounded for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions,</HI> that <HI>by his Stripes</HI> we might be <HI>healed.</HI> (I&s;ai. 53.5.) He <HI>gave him&s;elf for us, that he might purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar People.</HI> (Tit. 2.14.)</P>
<P>And &s;uch a People he actually hath in the World; <HI>which in Time pa&s;t were not a People, but are now the Peo|ple of God,</HI> who <HI>by his Stripes are healed.</HI> (1 Pet. 2.10, 24.) Multitudes have experienc'd the purifying Efficacy of his Blood, the healing Virtue of his Cro&s;s, and the quickning Power of his Re&s;urrection; even &s;ome of the greate&s;t Sinners. (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.10, 11. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.3, 5.)</P>
<P>Now the Work of the Holy Gho&s;t in applying the Redemption by Chri&s;t, for the quickning and healing of Men's Spirits, is one Thing imply'd in this <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> and <HI>Health of the Soul,</HI> as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to it: and in regard of that, every believing Soul may be &s;aid to be <HI>in Health</HI> and <HI>pro&s;per,</HI> if compar'd with what it was by
<PB N="9" REF="004954_0010_100E462B70F04260">
Nature, or with what the Souls of &s;uch be as are yet unconverted.</P>

<P>Let us labour for a thorow <HI>Conviction</HI> of this Doctrine of Original Sin. 'Tis mo&s;t evidently the Doctrine of Scripture: and abundantly confirm'd by the penitential Confe&s;&s;ions of Believers in every Age. Nor can any of you, if you con&s;ult your own Experience, find ju&s;t Occa|&s;ion to di&s;pute it. Do you not feel a <HI>Law of Sin</HI> working in you, and <HI>the Imagination of your Heart evil from your Youth up?</HI> (Gen. 8.21.) Were not the earlie&s;t Di&s;co|veries of Rea&s;on in you attended with Out-breakings of Corruption? How can you account for the fir&s;t <HI>evil</HI> and <HI>lu&s;tful Thought</HI> you had, but by a&s;&s;igning an <HI>evil Heart</HI> as the immediate Cau&s;e? Surely, it did not come from <HI>without</HI> but &s;prang from <HI>within,</HI> out of the Heart (<HI>Mar.</HI> 7.21) <HI>Then when Lu&s;t hath conceived, it bringeth forth Sin.</HI> (Jam. 1.15.) And while we &s;ee <HI>Children</HI> &s;o early, &s;o univer&s;ally mani|fe&s;ting an Aver&s;ion to what is Good, and a Di&s;po&s;ition to what is Evil, very often too again&s;t the Light of the be&s;t In&s;tructions, again&s;t the Force of the be&s;t Examples, and notwith&s;tanding all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;traints of a wi&s;e and holy Government over them, what other Cau&s;e can we re&s;olve the &s;ad Effect into, but the native Pravity of their own Mind and Con&s;cience? This is the Root of Bitterne&s;s, which &s;pringing up betimes, doth &s;o defile our Childhood and Youth. The Fruit being &s;o early and con&s;tantly bad, argues the Tree to be bad. <HI>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit; neither can a corrupt Tree produce good Fruit: Wherefore by their Fruits ye &s;hall know them.</HI> And by this Rule of judging, we know every one to be by Nature a <HI>corrupt Tree:</HI> not excepting even the rare In|&s;tances of &s;uch as are &s;aid to be <HI>&s;anctify'd from the Womb.</HI> For the&s;e being &s;anctify'd but in part, do by the frequent breaking out of remaining Lu&s;ts di&s;cover, that they were originally <HI>corrupt Trees,</HI> even as others.</P>
<P>This Doctrine lies in the Foundation of the grand Scheme of Man's <HI>Redemption.</HI> For without the Suppo&s;i|tion of original Sin, what &s;o great Need was there for the

And if &s;o, what Occa&s;ion for all that Co&s;t and Pains, which the only wi&s;e God has laid out in the Affair of Man's Salvation!

And &s;hall we not rejoyce, when any are bro't to <HI>believe unto the &s;aving of the Soul!</HI> Verily there's <HI>Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth.</HI> (Luk. 15.7.) Every new Conver&s;ion &s;pread a fre&s;h Tran&s;port of Joy all over Heaven; it puts a new Song into the Mouth of Angels; and is highly plea&s;ing to God. The Holy Gho&s;t rejoyces

in a new Triumph of his Power and Grace: The Re|deemer rejoyces in a new Te&s;timony to the Merits of his Cro&s;s and Efficacy of his Mediation: The Father rejoyces in a fre&s;h Witne&s;s to his electing Love, the Birth of a|nother Heir, and a new Addition to his Family. This is emblematically repre&s;ented in the Parable of the <HI>Pro|digal Son,</HI> in who&s;e return his Father rejoyced, and <HI>killed the fatted Calf, becau&s;e he had received him &s;afe and &s;ound.</HI> (Luk. 15.27.)&mdash;How do we rejoice in the Return of a Child or a Friend, thought to have been lo&s;t; and in his Recovery, after having been &s;ick nigh unto Death! With what Plea&s;ure do we receive &s;uch an one, as virtually rais'd from the Dead! And &s;hall we not much more re|joyce and exult in the Return of a lo&s;t Sinner, in the Re|covery of a peri&s;hing Soul. Do's not Love to our Fellow-Creatures, and a Regard to the Honour of God and Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t demand this of us? Ought we not to imitate the Example of holy Angels? Are we not willing to participate in the Joy of Heaven on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion!</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time we &s;hou'd <HI>lament,</HI> that the truly living Soul is &s;o <HI>rare</HI> a Spectacle: And &s;hould bemoan the unhappy Ca&s;e of Sinners in their <HI>Unregeneracy.</HI> Alas, <HI>their Mi&s;ery is great upon them.</HI> Be they Kings and great Men of the Earth, dwelling amid&s;t the highe&s;t Honours, Riches and Plea&s;ures of this World, yet &s;o long as <HI>aliena|ted from the Life of God,</HI> what is the Life they live! mean and low, little better than brutal. The mo&s;t pro&s;per|ous and dignify'd Sinner is but a <HI>vile Per&s;on</HI> (P&s;al 15.4.) a <HI>bruti&s;h Per&s;on; he is like the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.</HI> (P&s;al. 49.10, 12.) Verily a rueful putrifying Corp&s;e is not more horrible to the bodily Sight, than &s;uch a Per&s;on (dead in Sins) is to tho&s;e who have Eyes to <HI>di&s;cern be|tween Good and Bad.</HI> O what an odious horrid Spectacle is the Sinner, with a rotten Heart and unclean Hands, with the Image of Death and the Smell of Hell-Fire upon him! &mdash; But how lovely, how glorious a Sight the humble Convert, with the Beauty of Holine&s;s, the Re|&s;emblance of Heaven, and the Pre&s;ages of eternal Life

As the Number of Converts in <HI>Zion,</HI> in this remarkable Day of divine Power and Grace, is on the increa&s;ing Hand, and <HI>much People are daily added to the Lord</HI> in one Place and another, how &s;hou'd all that wou'd approve them&s;elves Lovers of Chri&s;t and Souls rejoyce and give Thanks! <HI>Prai&s;e ye the Lord: Prai&s;e the Lord, O my Soul.</HI>&mdash;Whatever Darkne&s;s and Difficulty may hang about the Minds of any, let them take Example from Act. 11.18. <HI>When they heard the&s;e Things, they held their Peace, and glorified</HI> GOD.&mdash;O how &s;hou'd we mag|nify the Lord with Thank&s;giving, who is &s;o marvellou&s;ly at this Day <HI>vi&s;iting</HI> our Land, to <HI>take out of it a People for his Name,</HI> and in &s;o exten&s;ive a Manner <HI>reviving his Work</HI> among&s;t us! May it &s;pread &s;till more and more, till the whole Land, yea the whole Earth, is filled with the Glory of the Lord! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This remarkable Work has &s;urprizingly by various Means and In&s;truments been increas'd and extended, &s;ince the Rev. Mr. ADAMS, Pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t Church in <HI>New-London,</HI> and <HI>a faith|ful Brother unto them (as I &s;uppo&s;e)</HI> publi&s;h'd his Thoughts upon it (Anno 1735) in a Preface to the Rev. Mr. <HI>E. Williams</HI>'s Ser. on <HI>Prov.</HI> 9.4 5.&mdash;I beg Leave on this Occa&s;ion to repeat from him the following Lines.</P>
<Q><P>We have heard of the <HI>Grace of God</HI> in &s;ome Parts of the Country; how his <HI>good</HI> SPIRIT hath been at work in divers Towns, to awaken a Concern in many about <HI>what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved;</HI> that this Concern continues, that it &s;preads, and that Per&s;ons are flocking into the Churches, as <HI>Doves to their Windows:</HI> It mu&s;t be look'd upon as a <HI>Token for Good,</HI> and &s;hould produce Prai&s;es to the LORD, who is graciou&s;ly <HI>vi&s;iting his People.</HI> Only let them who are thus awakened, take Care that they do not re&s;t in a deceitful Work; and look well to their future <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> (e&s;pecially &s;ince &s;o many Eyes are upon them) that it be altogether <HI>as becomes the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, but that the <HI>great Enemy of Souls</HI> will endeavour to di&s;grace and throw an Odium upon this good Work. It is no new Thing for him to &s;ow <HI>Tares</HI> in the LORD'S <HI>Feild</HI> among the <HI>good Wheat,</HI> e&s;pecially if the <HI>Servants &s;leep.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;o long as this Concern is awakened by the reading and hearing of the Word; while it reforms the Life, and clean&s;eth the Way; takes People off from their vain Confidences, and brings them kindly over to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; makes them &s;erious, watchful, prayerful and heavenly-minded; helps them to govern better their Thoughts, Words and Actions, Appe|tites and Inclinations, Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections; di&s;po&s;eth them to be ju&s;t and righteous, kind and charitable to all that are about them; and finally, fills them with Love to God, his Truths, his Ways, his Wor&s;hip and his People; Now it hath <HI>&s;uch Marks of a divine Work,</HI> that the more general it is, &s;o much the better: and as it advanceth and &s;preads thro' the Country, we &s;hould all cry, <HI>Grace, Grace unto it.</HI></P>
<P>Some People at a Di&s;tance hearing of this Concern and Stirring, are quite at a <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> how to account for it; they <HI>wonder</HI> what &s;hould be the Occa&s;ion, and nothing le&s;s than &s;ome <HI>Prophet</HI> or <HI>Angel</HI> &s;ent from above, or &s;ome Expectation of the World's &s;udden coming to an <HI>End,</HI> &s;eems to them &s;ufficient to make it either &s;o great or &s;o exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>Others <HI>mock</HI> and <HI>deride.</HI></P>
<P>But what is there after all &s;o very unaccountable in this Mat|ter? Or what is there &s;o very peculiar in their Circum&s;tances, who are now, thro' the Mercy of God, &s;o very much con|cerned? Ought not all unconverted Sinners &s;adly to think of their lo&s;t and undone Condition without an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, if they would act rea&s;onably? and will they not al&s;o be bro't to it in the Day when the Lord &s;hall <HI>open their Eyes?</HI> Truly it is wonderful, to think how they re&s;t Day and Night, while they have Rea&s;on to judge that they are yet in the <HI>Gall of Bitterne&s;s and Bond of Iniquity.</HI> Then &s;hall the&s;e wondering People know the meaning of this Di&s;pen&s;ation, when the Spirit of Grace and Supplication &s;hall drive them into their <HI>inner Chambers,</HI> to unbo&s;om them|&s;elves before the Lord: And it would be one of the be&s;t Days of all their Lives, were they bro't into the like Con|dition.</P></Q></NOTE></P>

Let me &s;peak freely to you: In Ca&s;e you have not been made <HI>alive to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> you are vain Pretenders, and do but boa&s;t of a fal&s;e Gift, in claiming the Character of <HI>pro&s;perous</HI> and <HI>healed Souls.</HI> Alas, there are Multitudes in the profe&s;&s;ing World, to whom that pungent Rebuke is applicable, Matth. 9.12. <HI>They that be whole, need not a Phy&s;ician.</HI> It &s;eems &s;poken of the <HI>conceitedly</HI> whole, who imagine they want no Healing. Like tho&s;e whom <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;peaks of, Prov. 20.12. <HI>There is a Generation, that are pure in their own Eyes, and yet are not wa&s;hed from their Filthine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Some there be, that are <HI>gro&s;s Sinners,</HI> but labouring of a <HI>&s;tupify'd</HI> Con&s;cience, they go on quietly in known ha|bitual Wickedne&s;s; tho' under the greate&s;t Danger by fatal Wounds, yet in&s;en&s;ible and utterly unconcern'd to get &s;piritual healing. The&s;e, if they were not Strangers to all &s;erious Self-Reflection, mu&s;t needs know them&s;elves to be under the Power of unmortify'd Lu&s;ts, and in the Way to eternal De&s;truction. But <HI>the God of this World hath blinded their Mind,</HI> and <HI>&s;eared their Con&s;cience as with a hot Iron,</HI> that they feel no Impre&s;&s;ions from God's Word or Providence, feel no Remor&s;e or Shame for Sin, no Fear of Death or of Wrath to come.

Thir&s;t.</HI> Deut. 29.19. Sinners, that have their Con&s;cience thus benumb'd and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, often are found tru&s;ting in their religious Parentage, external Profe&s;&s;ion and Cove|nant-Relation to God, as the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> who glory'd in having <HI>Abraham</HI> to their Father, yet did not the Works of <HI>Abraham;</HI> and who made their Boa&s;t of GOD, yet were Children of the <HI>Devil.</HI> (Joh. 8.41, 44.) The&s;e are po&s;ting on to the <HI>Damnation of Hell,</HI> yet are &s;o &s;tupify'd as not to con&s;ider their Hazard, nor ever really apprehend their Nece&s;&s;ity of a Saviour.</P>
<P>But others there be, of a more refin'd Character, yet equally in Danger of peri&s;hing by Means of a deluded Fancy, and fal&s;e Hopes, from other Cau&s;es. I have in my Eye now &s;uch as are under the Power of a <HI>deceived</HI> and <HI>flattering</HI> Con&s;cience; &s;uch as have taken up a ground|le&s;s Opinion of <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> as if they were <HI>&s;omething</HI> in Religion, while indeed they are <HI>nothing.</HI> Some unhappily form a wrong Judgment of their State, by applying <HI>fal&s;e Rules,</HI> and others by <HI>mi&s;applying</HI> the true; and having enroll'd them&s;elves among the Children of God, their confident Pre&s;umption breeds a Calm in their Brea&s;ts, lulls Con&s;cience a&s;leep; and &s;ometimes an Imagination that <HI>the Bitterne&s;s of Death is pa&s;t,</HI> produces a &s;ingular Satisfaction and Chearfulne&s;s of Mind. By Rea&s;on of &s;ome &s;en&s;ible <HI>Changes</HI> they've experienc'd in them&s;elves, under the common and lower Operations of the Spirit, they fondly dream, that they are <HI>whole</HI> and <HI>need not a Phy&s;ician.</HI> For In&s;tance, they have been bro't under legal Awaknings (it may be, very &s;trong Convictions, great Terrors, and long continu'd) and afterwards have emerg'd out of their Darkne&s;s and Di&s;tre&s;s, perhaps into a Light and Joy &s;urprizing to them; have felt Enlarge|ments in Duty at Times, Meltings of Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;eem|ingly good Affections; have reform'd their external Practice to a great Degree; are grown warm Advocates in the Cau&s;e of Reformation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now here they re&s;t, and build their Hope, at a Di&s;tance from Chri&s;t and Grace. On &s;uch Accounts as the&s;e, they <HI>flatter them|&s;elves in their own Eyes,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves <HI>converted</HI> and

<HI>healed,</HI> and think their <HI>Souls</HI> in a <HI>pro&s;perous</HI> Way; while yet in Truth they remain under the Power of Death, &s;ome ineffectual Check only is given to their Di&s;ea&s;e, and their Wounds are but &s;ooth'd for the pre&s;ent, by a meer pal|liative and &s;uperficial Cure. Indeed they never were truly <HI>broken-hearted,</HI> never thorowly <HI>wounded in Spirit,</HI> nor ever apply'd the true Go&s;pel-Remedy. Con&s;cience is over-rul'd and &s;ilenc'd; but not truly heal'd and pacify'd. What Convictions they had, are only worn off; they've <HI>quench'd the Spirit;</HI> and the Calm they po&s;&s;e&s;s, is but a temporary and fal&s;e Peace; their Joy but a fla&s;hy and imaginary Plea&s;ure. That awful Word is applicable to them, I&s;ai. 44.20. <HI>He feedeth of A&s;hes; a deceived Heart hath turned him a&s;ide, that he cannot de|liver his Soul, nor &s;ay, Is there not a Lie in my right Hand!</HI> Alas, they &s;till <HI>need the Phy&s;ician,</HI> as much as ever; tho' <HI>their Heart thinketh not &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>Some who have pa&s;&s;ed under <HI>no</HI> remarkable Change, but appear'd hopefully pious from their Childhood, are little better than that <HI>young Jew</HI> in the Go&s;pel (Matth. 19.) to whom our Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;aid, <HI>One Thing thou lacke&s;t:</HI> And who, after &s;olemn Prote&s;tations of his unblemi&s;h'd Morals, yet when put to the Trial cho&s;e to part with a Saviour and renounce Heaven, rather than &s;acrifice the World and deny his Lu&s;ts. Had this young Pretender a <HI>healed Soul,</HI> a <HI>clean Heart,</HI> and a <HI>right Spirit</HI> within him, think you! Nay, but a &s;ick Soul, a foul Heart, and a fal&s;e Spirit, under the di&s;gui&s;e of a fair Profe&s;&s;ion and plau&s;ible Appearance. Is it not to be fear'd, that among <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Profe&s;&s;ors many are but <HI>as that young Man,</HI> deceiving their Neighbours, cheating them&s;elves, and mocking God by <HI>a fair Shew in the Fle&s;h?</HI></P>
<P>Others who have actually had a vi&s;ible and perhaps very remarkable Change wro't upon them, may yet be no better Chri&s;tians than that <HI>Simon,</HI> who from a noted <HI>Sorcerer</HI> became a Go&s;pel-Profe&s;&s;or, and doubtle&s;s for a time was look'd on by others (perhaps too by him&s;elf) as a notable In&s;tance of converting Grace; but at Length his Hypocri&s;y being detected, he met with that awful Re|buke
<PB N="25" REF="004954_0026_100E4660FA343520">
from an in&s;pir'd Apo&s;tle, (Act. 8.) <HI>Thou ha&s;t neither Part nor Lot in this Matter: For thy Heart is not right in the Sight of God.&mdash;For I perceive, that thou art in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s, and in the Bond of Iniquity.</HI> So as to many a Profe&s;&s;or, it may be fear'd, notwith&s;tanding their glori|ous Preten&s;ions as to inward Feelings, and a con&s;picuous Alteration in Externals, that after all <HI>their Heart is not right with God,</HI> is not <HI>&s;ound in his Statutes,</HI> but &s;till <HI>goeth after their Covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> or other fooli&s;h and hurtful Lu&s;ts. Their Corruptions are only under a pre&s;ent Re&s;triction; but really retain a &s;ecret Power and Dominion. It is but an imperfect Work they've known, whether of <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI> Their boa&s;ted Experiences are e&s;&s;entially de|fective; their Graces but glittering Counterfeits; and all their Virtue but unregenerate Morality: they are aliena|ted from the Life of God; and have but the dead Car|ca&s;e of Religion.&mdash;Indeed it becomes &s;hort-&s;ighted fal|lible Man to be very cautious in applying &s;o dreadful a Cen&s;ure to particular Ca&s;es. I apprehend, the Word of God, which ought to be our governing Rule, forbids our explicitly condemning particular Per&s;ons in regard of their inferior State, and pronouncing po&s;itively again&s;t them the Charge of Hypocri&s;y, but upon notorious Evidence of bad Externals, incon&s;i&s;tent with a credible Profe&s;&s;ion. However, in general we have Rea&s;on &s;adly to fear, that many a forward and &s;howy Profe&s;&s;or is really but an empty Pretender; and at be&s;t no better than an <HI>Almo&s;t-Chri&s;tian,</HI> in the Sight of HIM <HI>who&s;e Eyes are as a Flame of Fire,</HI> which pierce thro' the thicke&s;t Vizors, and often &s;ee a wretchedly di&s;temper'd Spirit under a beautiful Out&s;ide, and vi&s;ible Form of Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>O let us then (how candid &s;oever we are in judging of others) be inclin'd rather to Severity in Self-Exami|nation and Self-judging. Let it be our Concern to get Con&s;cience &s;ufficiently inform'd by the Word and Spirit of God; and let an enlighten'd Con&s;cience do its Office, in impartially trying and cen&s;uring us, that we may not by a deceitful Peace and a pre&s;umptuous Hope betray our immortal Souls into remedile&s;s Ruin.

Let Con&s;cience be &s;tartled at the tremendous Pro&s;pect. In&s;tantly &s;hake off vain Merriment; laugh no more in your plea&s;ing Dreams, and mad Security: But let your Heart meditate Terror, and be bowed down heavily, at the Sight of your &s;inful Sickne&s;s, Mi&s;ery and Hazard.</P>

(Joh. 16.8.) As Agent under and for CHRIST, in the Application of Re|demption, he works Conviction in a Way becoming his own Character as the Spirit of Grace and Truth, in a Way &s;ub&s;ervient to the Ends of his ble&s;&s;ed Office, and pur&s;uant to the De&s;ign of the Saviour's Undertaking; and in a Way accommodated to the intellectual Nature of Man, in its State of Apo&s;ta&s;y; informing his <HI>Judgment,</HI> as well as influencing his Pa&s;&s;ions; working on his <HI>Hopes,</HI> as well as his Fears; <HI>encouraging</HI> him from the rich Provi&s;ions of <HI>Grace,</HI> as well as terrifying him by the flaming Sword of Ju&s;tice; <HI>humbling</HI> and <HI>melting</HI> his Heart, as well as pricking his Con&s;cience; directing him to a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> as well as affecting him with his Malady; and making U&s;e of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> as well as of the Law, to the&s;e Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Examine now into your Experience; and take heed, that you don't deceive your&s;elves, by taking up contented with a partial and imperfect Work of Conviction.

O look to it, that with Re|gard to this introductory Work you do indeed <HI>begin in the Spirit,</HI> and that you do not <HI>end in the Fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) Then, beware of <HI>Apo&s;tacy</HI> from hopeful Beginnings of Conviction, &amp; relap&s;ing into <HI>Security.</HI>&mdash;True Conviction, in any Degree of it, is an In&s;tance of divine preventing Mercy. It is the Fruit of the SPIRIT <HI>&s;triving</HI> with you. O for&s;ake not your own Mercies. <HI>Quench not the Spirit.</HI> (1 The&s;. 5.19.) Don't &s;light Conviction, nor oppo&s;e it: but follow it on, fall in with it, and labour to promote its genuine Effects. As you love your Souls, be always in Care, that you <HI>do not turn the Grace of God into Wantonne&s;s;</HI> that you do not <HI>grieve</HI> and <HI>vex the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> by wilful Re&s;i&s;tance or affected Stupidity under his Hand.

This Tem|per and Conduct is derogatory to Go&s;pel-Grace, a Reproach to the Father of Mercies, a Di&s;paragement to the meek and compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer, a Grief to the Holy Spirit, the madde&s;t Cruelty to your own Soul, and a Gratification of <HI>your Adver&s;ary the Devil, who goeth about as a roaring Lion, &s;eeking whom he may devour;</HI> "who&s;e Trade is to tear poor Souls in Pieces, and torture them all he can". Reali&s;e it, there is a <HI>Terror</HI> that is dangerous, unprofitable, unnece&s;&s;ary; ari&s;ing from Unbelief, and de&s;ponding Tho'ts and Pa&s;&s;ions, under a <HI>Satanick</HI> Influence. Beware here. Tho' the Devil would fain per&s;wade you, that the Day of Vi&s;itation is over with you, that your Ca&s;e is unremediable, and hopele&s;s like his own, yet believe him not. What tho' your Di&s;ea&s;es and Wounds be truly immedicable, by all the Skill and Power of Creatures, and &s;o your Ca&s;e is hazardous &amp; deplorable?

<P>Do you feel your &s;elves &s;ick and peri&s;hing? Do your Wounds &s;mart and pain you? Do your putrifying Sores make you even &s;tink in your own No&s;trils?

But, whatever the Devil and a deceitful Heart may &s;ay to affright you, don't give Way to de&s;pairing Apprehen&s;ions. Believe it, there is a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> and in him is Help to be found. He has a &s;overeign Remedy for every Malady, effectual Re|lief for every Grievance. Your Sin and Mi&s;ery do not exceed the Sufficiency of your Phy&s;ician, or the Virtue of his Remedies. He is able even to <HI>rai&s;e the Dead:</HI> He <HI>quick'neth whom he will:</HI> and his Compa&s;&s;ion is equal to his Power. He is taking you in Hand; and if you don't repul&s;e him in the Methods of his Wi&s;dom and Grace, by Unbelief, Impatience &amp; Di&s;pondence, nor affront him by returning to Security and Pre&s;umption, there are promi&s;ing

<P><PB N="50" REF="004954_0051_100E46BB6C752A20">I &s;hould have now gone on to the other.</P>
<P>PROP. 2. <HI>Regenerate Souls,</HI> as view'd in a Compari&s;on of <HI>one with ano|ther</HI> (or of the &s;ame Souls, with them&s;elves, at different Times) may in certain &s;pecial Ca&s;es <HI>eminently</HI> be &s;aid to <HI>pro&s;per</HI> and be in <HI>Health.</HI></P>
<P>Here I might &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) One Ca&s;e is, when there is a remarkable Proficiency in chri&s;tian experimental <HI>Knowledge;</HI> &s;ingular Improvement in &s;piritual Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Another Ca&s;e is, when there's a di&s;tingui&s;hing Growth in <HI>Grace,</HI> and Progre&s;s in the Divine <HI>Life;</HI> the new Man increa&s;ing in the Vigour and Activity of it's holy Principles &amp; Powers of Operation.</P>

<P>USE 3.

<P>USE 8 When we are wi&s;hing the Welfare of <HI>others,</HI> let us in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place wi&s;h them this <HI>be&s;t</HI> of Ble&s;&s;ings, that their <HI>Souls</HI> may live and pro&s;per and be in Health &mdash;<HI>This is my Heart's De&s;ire and Prayer to God,</HI> for you, my dear Friends: and no better Wi&s;h can I de&s;ire you to put up on my Behalf&mdash;Ye <HI>Parents,</HI> what can you de&s;ire better for your &s;elves, or your Children, than this <HI>Soul-Pro&s;perity?</HI> O inculcate upon <HI>them</HI> the Care of their <HI>Souls;</HI> u&s;e all private Means with them for their &s;piritual Good; bring them betimes under the publick Means, and by your Example teach them to Honour the&s;e. <Q>When you have been as a <HI>Sermon,</HI> perhaps you will &s;ometimes de&s;pi&s;e what you have heard: but beware here.

Above all be much in Prayer with and for your Children, that all Means may be ble&s;&s;ed to their <HI>Soul-Pro&s;perity.</HI>&mdash;And you that are <HI>Children,</HI> what better Ble&s;&s;ing, than this, can you wi&s;h to your&s;elves, or your Parents!
